    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Mary Helen immortino yang Dr\nimrdino Yang is a professor of Education\nPsychology and Neuroscience at the\nUniversity of Southern California her\nlaboratory focuses on emotions and the\nrole of emotions in learning as well as\nhow social interactions impact how we\nlearn today's discussion is one that I\nfound absolutely fascinating because it\nwill reveal to you in fact to all of us\nhow our temperament that is our\nemotionality combined with our home\nenvironment and the school environments\nthat we were raised in shape what we\nknow about the world and our concepts of\nself\nin thinking about that we also discuss\nthe education system and how different\naspects of rules and how we are told to\nbehave and what actually constitutes\ngood behavior or bad behavior shape how\nwe learn information and develop a sense\nof meaning in life if any of that sounds\nabstract I promise you that today's\ndiscussion is incredibly practical you\nwill learn for instance how different\nstyles of learning are going to favor\ndifferent people from children into\nadulthood and how we ought to think\nabout learning in terms of our emotional\nsystems being our guide for what we\nlearn and the information that we retain\nand how we apply that information\nthroughout life for those of you that\nare parents or who are thinking of\nbecoming parents or who were once\nchildren so I believe that encompasses\neverybody out there today's discussion\nwill arm you with an intellectual\nunderstanding of Psychology and\nNeuroscience as it relates to learning\nbut also practical tools that you can\napply in order to be able to learn more\neffectively what I like so much about Dr\nemordino Yang's research and the\ndiscussion today is that she frames up\nbeautifully how those who best learn\nfrom traditional forms of classroom\nlearning as well as those who learn from\nnon-traditional forms of learning either\nin or out of the classroom can best use\nthat understanding of Self in order to\nlearn in the way that is best for them\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is eight sleep eight\nsleep makes Smart mattress covers with\ncooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity I've talked many times before\non this podcast about the fact that\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance of all\nkinds one of the key things to getting a\ngreat night's sleep is the temperature\nof your sleeping environment and that's\nbecause your core body temperature\nactually has to drop by about one to\nthree degrees in order for you to get\ninto and stay deeply asleep and\nconversely your core body temperature\nincreases by about one to three degrees\nin order for you to wake up and feel\nrefreshed with eight sleep you can\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment very easily because of the\nway that the mattress cover communicates\nwith an app where you can dial in the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nat the beginning middle and end of your\nnight as you arrive toward morning\nsleeping on an eight-sleep mattress\ncover has greatly enhanced the quality\nof my sleep I know that because it also\nincludes a sleep tracker which will tell\nyou how much slow wave sleep and rapid\neye movement sleep you're getting and it\ngives you a sleep score if you'd like to\ntry eat sleep go to eightsleep.com\nhuberman and get up to 150

is a\nketone supplement that increases blood\nketones I know most people are familiar\nwith or at least have heard of the\nso-called ketogenic diet it's used for\nweight loss it's used to control\nepilepsy it's used for mental health\nreasons however most people including\nmyself do not follow a ketogenic diet\nnonetheless increasing your blood\nketones can improve the function of your\nbrain and the function of your body and\nthat's because ketones are preferred use\nof fuel for the brain and body so even\nthough I follow an omnivore diet that is\nI'm not in a ketogenic State I use\nketone don't IQ to increase my blood\nketones prior to doing preparation for\npodcasts or writing grants or doing\nresearch as well as prior to workouts\nespecially if I want to work out fasted\nI'll take some Ketone IQ to increase my\nblood ketones which gives me a lot of\nenergy during workouts or during bouts\nof cognitive work even if I haven't\neaten in the preceding hours it really\nincreases my focus and my energy levels\nif you'd like to try Ketone IQ you can\ngo to hvmn.com huberman to save 20 off\nagain that's\nhvmn.com huberman to save 20 percent\ntoday's episode is also brought To Us by\nRoca Roca Mike's eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are the absolute highest\nquality the company was founded by two\nAll-American swimmers from Stanford and\neverything about Roca eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were designed with\nperformance in mind I've spent a\nlifetime working on the biology the\nvisual system and I can tell you that\nyour visual system has to contend with\nan enormous number of different\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly Roca understands those\nchallenges and has designed their\neyeglasses in sunglasses this\naccordingly so that you always see with\nperfect clarity their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially designed for\nsports performance and as a consequence\nthey are very lightweight which is great\nthey also won't slip off your face if\nyou get sweaty however even though they\nwere designed for sports performance\nthey now also include a lot of styles\nthat are designed to be worn to work out\nto dinner essentially recreationally so\nyou could wear anywhere if you'd like to\ntry Roca eyeglasses or sunglasses go to\nRoka that's roka.com and enter the code\nhuberman to save 20 off your order again\nthat's Roca

about\nsomething that\nto me seems a little bit high level but\nI think it's the perfect jumping off\npoint\nI've heard you talk before about\ninspiration and awe and as somebody\nwho's interested in the brain and as\nsomebody who's interested in the role of\nemotions and learning and life\nexperience\ninspiration and awe seem to me kind of\nrather high level emotional experiences\ncompared to say fear or happiness\nand yet inspiration and awe just seems\nso fundamental to how we learn and\nnavigate life and before we started\nrecording we were talking about David\nGoggins of all people\num and we'll get back to that but\nif you could just share with us\nwhat is the role of inspiration and awe\nand story in how we learn and experience\nlife starting at a young age and then\nmaybe we can transition to older ages\nyeah I mean I think what you've noticed\nis actually fundamental to the conundrum\nof being a human is that our most high\nlevel complex or in-states mind States\nare also fundamentally\nhooking themselves into the most basic\nbiological Machinery that literally we\nshare with alligators that keeps us\nalive and that is both the power and the\npotential of being a human and the\ndanger of it so our beliefs are\nexperiences our interpretations of the\nmeaning of things which that's where the\nstory comes in the stories that we\nconjure about you know collectively with\nother people culturally in spaces inside\nour own selves also those stories become\nkind of the through line that organizes\nthe way in which we construct our own\nexperience Consciousness even I would\nsay so when we hook into those very\nbasic Survival Systems by recruiting\nthem into these narratives about the\nnature of reality the power of the\nmeaning we make what happens is we get\nthis amazingly both fundamental and high\nlevels State simultaneously where we\nfeel expansive we feel uh like it's all\nso incredibly beautiful\nand we are I would argue actually\nramping into or catching into the very\nbasic survival mechanisms that make us\nconscious that make us alive and and\nthat's that's in essence the power of\nbeing a human That's The Power of our\nintelligence at this late stage in our\nevolution\nso when I was a kid I loved stories of\nall kinds like I think like most kids\nyeah I love my Curious George books uh\nI'm told I like the Babar books but then\nquickly didn't like the Babar books\num I liked the book Where the Red Fern\nGrows I liked um books and stories about\nit generally was boys for me for\nwhatever reason uh that had some idea in\nmind or some ongoing Challenge and that\nplayed out over time and the character\nevolves across the story yeah and of\ncourse many many many excellent stories\nhave all those features yeah\nI can recall specific passages in those\nbooks to this day\nthat made me feel something in my body\nyou know a um I actually am very\nfamiliar with the sensation of having\nchills go up my spine as opposed to down\nmy spine early on I realized oh there's\nsort of a difference sometimes it\ntravels up my spine sometimes I still\nhaven't distinguished what what that\norients me to or away from but but it's\na very\num Salient memory and experience for me\nto this day so much so that as I'm\ndescribing the book Where the Red Fern\nGrows Right now I can kind of feel it\nstarting yeah\nI've heard you say before and I love\nthis quote and I want to make sure that\nyou get attribution for this not me that\nwe basically have a brain to control our\nbody\n[Music]\nwhat is the the role of the brain in\ncontrolling the body and do you think\nthat there are an infinite number of\nways in which our brain does that or are\nwe really talking about a language\nbetween brain and body of you know\ntingles on the back of our neck that go\nup tingles on the back of our neck that\ngo down stomach feeling kind of tight\nand making us cringe away or kind of\nwarm and wanting to approach in other\nwords do you think that the conversation\nbetween the brain and body is primitive\nsophisticated how nuanced is it because\nlanguage is very nuanced we could\nprobably come up with 50 words just in\nEnglish for the state of being happy\nyeah but the feeling of being happy I\nexperience along a Continuum of a little\nbit happy to elated but it's it's kind\nof one thing really so if if you would\ncould you comment on this notion of the\nbrain being the organ that's responsible\nfor controlling the body and what that\ndialogue is like what the syllables and\nconsonants of it are like perhaps not at\nthe level of biology but at the level of\npsychology and how we subjectively\nexperience that sure so the first thing\nI'll say is that I learned that idea\nfrom it from working with Antonia\ndimasio so uh he was my postdoctoral\nmentor and he taught me first that uh\nthis notion that that it's the feeling\nof the body it's it's an organism's\nability to represent or map the state of\nthe interior and exterior of the body\nthat becomes the substrate for\nConsciousness and for the mind\num so I would just want to give him\ncredit because I didn't I didn't think\nof that first but the work that I've\nbeen doing is an elaboration of that\nit's it's basically addressing exactly\nthe question that you're asking which is\nhow is it that we construct a narrative\nconstruct a conscious feeling which that\nword I take from Antonio and Hannah\nright DiMaggio how is it that we\nconstruct a feeling and sort of\nprioritize that feeling elaborate that\nfeeling into something that feels like a\nnarrative that feels like a belief state\nor an emotion state or an experience I\nmean that in a very verb-like way and um\nand what is the role of embodiment in\nthat what is the role of the brain and\nthat\num and and what also is the role of the\nculture and the cultural context on\nother people in that because what we're\nreally learning Across The Sciences\nright now is just how incredibly social\nand interdependent our species is I mean\nour biology is inherently a social one\nwe are directly dependent on other\npeople for the formulation of our own\nsense of self and we interact with one\nanother and construct and co-construct a\nsense of self and a sense of meaning via\nthose cultural spaces and those sort of\num nuanced ways of accommodating each\nother mentally and physically that that\nlead to the feeling of us so you know\nback to your original question there's a\nlot we don't know there\num but I think what's very clear is that\nthe kind of background sense of the body\nthe mapping and the regulation of the\nbody is a basic substrate a kind of of\ntrampoline for the mind and so we are\nmanaging our survival you know we now\nhave lots of evidence from across many\nkinds of science about the\ninterdependence of our stress and social\nrelationships and our immunity and our\nright and and our ability to digest food\nand and it's even now very clear that\nit's not even just us there's a whole\nmicrobiome and all kinds of other\norganisms that are assisting Us in that\nand that are collaborating with us in\nthat\num and then the brain is is this is a\nspecialized organ of the body in fact\nit's not a it's not a separate thing\nit's it's an outgrowth or an elaboration\nof that process it's a specialization of\nthat process a localization of it\num in a way that provides enough\nprocessing power to be able to really\nconstruct uh all kinds of feelings and\nmental States and beliefs and imaginings\nyou know\num out of out of basically just the\nfeeling of being here and then the\namazing part is that our brain is also\nimposing those back down onto our bodies\nso the way in which our body reacts\num and is modulated in response to\nmental States is also very real so we\nhave a kind of like a dynamic uh\nconversation happening that's happening\nin very raw and and direct ways\nneurochemically and others and also in\nbroader longer term slower fluctuating\npatterns around you know other kinds of\nhormonal changes and things like that so\nalong multiple time scales\nsimultaneously we have a kind of whole\nright a humanistic whole of brain and\nbody and mind that are kind of\nco-conjoring one another in real time\nand that leads to all kinds of dynamic\npossibility spaces for how we are and\nhow we feel as we grow through time and\nI think as humans the legacy of our\nintelligence is to tap into those\npossibility spaces and start to\nconstruct them into meaningful\nmeaningful sort of chains of ideas\nchains of experiences over time that we\ncall story and that I think is what you\nwere tapping into as a little boy you\nwere hungry for fodder for for a kind of\nstructure for those feelings that you\ncould start to help them evolve from one\ninto the other and chain them together\nin ways that produce meaning\nyeah I'm fascinated by the idea that\nearly in life we experience\nsome interaction with the world it could\nbe with other people could be with an\nobject in the world and it makes us feel\nsomething powerful yeah and that lays a\na template for of recognition meaning\nthat later in life and perhaps\nthroughout life we're always consciously\nyour subconsciously going back to trying\nto experience that same kind of awe or\ninspiration\num because again that the what the\ncircumstances\nalmost certainly vary from being a\nfive-year-old to being an adolescent and\ninto adulthood\nand into the I guess the geriatric years\ndo they still call it that\num probably I probably used a\npolitically incorrect term but forgive\nme\num 75 to 125.\num\nand yet the feeling is the same right\nthe feeling and so it's as if a word can\nmean the same thing but be used 50\ndifferent ways maybe 5 000 different\nways to represent in this analogy I'm\nsaying that the the word is the feeling\nand you know and it's used so many\ndifferent ways because\num occasionally I'll read a scientific\nmanuscript that is so cool and it's the\nsame way that I feel yes when I was nine\nyears old and I spend all my time in the\npet store looking at Tropical Fish and\ntropical birds and thinking oh my God\nthat freshwater discus fish is the\ncoolest thing I've ever seen yeah and\nagain I think I must have a strong\nmemory for these kinds of things yeah\nbecause I still I feel it right now in\nmy body so it's as if the the same thing\nmaps to so many different circumstances\nso is what we're learning across the\nlifespan a recognition of feelings in\nour body as ah this is something I like\nbecause of the way it makes my body feel\nor is it cognitive or both from your\nanswer a moment ago it seems like it's\nso interconnected and bi-directional and\nfast that it's impossible to really say\nthat feelings are in the body or in the\nbrain it's really\num happening simultaneously yeah it's a\ndynamic of merchant State let me give\nyou an example so that I use sometimes\nto help myself understand the notion so\nI'm\nyou know my little my little daughter\nokay Nora when she was two two in some\nmonths two and four months that she's a\nvery verbal kid and uh I was sitting in\nthe kitchen one day drinking a cup of\ntea I was sad about something that\nhappened in my life but I I wasn't\nweeping or anything I was just sitting\nthere I must have looked kind of you\nknow lost in my own thoughts she's\nplaying around on the floor she came\nover to me\nI'll never forget it this tiny little\nperson she comes over to me and noticed\nI wasn't really there with her you know\nwhat I mean and she my arm was hanging\ndown she picked up my arm and she held\nit against her face like that and she\nsaid\nI won't say in baby talk because you\nwon't understand but she said don't\nworry Mama I'll take care of you\nand I said yeah and I said oh no that's\nso that's so sweet sweetie I'll take\ncare of you too and she said and Mama\nI will we love you I really love you and\nthen she said I mean\nI really love y'all um I really love\nyour arm right\nfast forward two years later almost\nexactly two years she's four in a couple\nmonths and she was in bed one night\nlaying in her bed in the dark and I\nwalked by and I listened at the door to\nsee if she was sleeping there and I hear\nthis little whisper comes out and she\nsays mama\nI love you more than I'm glad that\nthere's daytime\nright\nwhat's changed developmentally from her\nat age two to her at age four right I\nwould argue that the physiological\nsubstrate of her attachment to her\nmother is probably quite similar she had\nthis sort of visceral automatic\nbiological you might say attachment\nconnection to me emotionally that she\nwas trying to leverage in the service of\nmaking sense of you know being active in\nthat world and adapting herself to the\nsituation helping me in the first case\nright\nbut what's changed remarkably is not the\nsubstrate of that attachment it's her\nability to conceptualize it right when\nshe's two her love is experienced as\nthis incredibly\nconcrete embodied real physical thing\nlike I love you I mean I really love the\nbody part I am currently smooshing\nagainst my face right whereas two years\nlater\nshe can conceptualize that love in terms\nof an idea which is you know wouldn't it\nbe awful if there was night time all the\ntime and there was no sunshine and\ndaylight and I couldn't go out to play\nand I couldn't write you're describing\nmy biggest fear people listening to this\npodcast I know that I'm gonna go into\nthe grave hopefully a long time from now\nyeah telling people to get morning\nsunlight in their eyes\nyeah but please continue yeah no but\nthat's right so she's thinking about how\nmuch she is grateful for there to be\nsunlight and in her little mind she\nconnected that\nto the the feeling of being attached to\nme and used one to explain the other\nright so that both things now have\nmeaning and that is the way that is the\nway I think that we start to elaborate\nthese very basic physiological\nattachment States aversion States right\nmotivational states of various sorts\ninto mental States beliefs poems you\nknow uh love songs all the things that\nshe does right even between Age Two and\nage four that really are mental\nelaborations meaning making of that very\nphysiologically basic sensation does\nthat answer your question it answers it\nincredibly clearly uh and so much so\nthat I'd like to continue to build on\nthat example\num because I think it's very relatable\nfor people and it's the first time that\nI've ever heard the embodiment of\nemotions\ndescribed in a developmental framework\nthat truly makes sense okay\num so thank you\nso the contact with your arm or your arm\nor both uh was the the was the life\nexample that she was using it as a\ntwo-year-old that maps to an internal\nfeeling and and we're gonna assume she's\nnot here we don't have her in a brain\nscanner we can't ask her but we're going\nto assume that her experience of being\nput to bed at night and and feeling so\nso much love from and for you\nmap to her then uh growing understanding\nof the the world around her the fact\nthat there's day and night and sunshine\nso as her knowledge base grows she can\nadd examples to the feeling and I'm\nassuming that\num doesn't matter how old she is now but\nI'm assuming that as a 14 year old the\nknowledge base is going to be different\nand is going to map to that feeling\nagain and again so the question is\nis what we are doing across the lifespan\nis recognizing\num sort of I don't want to call them\nPrimitives but\num basic emotional states which are not\ninfinite but can be along each one along\na Continuum so a little bit of love\ncompletely in love you know along\nContinuum and everything in between\num a little angry and annoyed to\ncompletely Furious are we talking about\nmaybe\num 10 to 30 core emotions that then we\nare just simply binning our experiences\ninto and onto and mapping onto and then\nthat's our life story and I'm not trying\nto oversimplify things but\num\nthat seems to me like a pretty great way\nfor a nervous system to navigate a world\nthat is infinitely complex yeah and has\na lot of surprise both positive and\nnegative and in which like every\norganism our main goal is to survive as\nlong as possible and not for everybody\nbut in many cases to try and make more\nof ourselves I mean those seem to be the\nbasic Drive survive and make more of\noneself it seems to be the two basic\nfunctions of everything ideas or more of\nyour work from more of your art right\nexactly\num so is that in\nan overly simplistic way to think about\nit or does it does it work even if\nthere's more that needs to be added does\nthat work as a 20 year old I learned\nthings in college and I'm like this is\nawesome the first time I learned about\nthe hypothalamus this whole marble size\nstructure and the fact that different\nneurons sitting right next to each other\ncan put us into a rage where we'll make\nus want to mate or we'll make us thirsty\nor hungry or tired I was like wow yeah I\nmean it just it blew me away it still\nblows me away yeah but the feeling is\nthe same as looking at The discus fish\nin the in Monet's Pet Shop on California\nAvenue when I'm nine years old so is\nthat the way to think about it I think\nyes I think there is there's an awful\nlot of basic physiological mechanisms\nthat are that become motivational\nmechanisms right in in all the senses uh\nadaptive mechanisms that we share with\nall life forms not even just all animals\nbut all life forms but they look\ndifferent in different life forms for\nsure because the Adaptive functions the\ntime scales and everything are different\nif you're a tree than if you're a fish\nthen if you're a slime mold or you're me\nright but I think you're right that what\nwe basically are doing is taking these\nvery primitive physiological regulatory\ncapacities that are essentially there to\nkeep you alive and and that's a very\nDynamic thing to keep you alive you have\nto constantly adjust for the the needs\nof the internal organism the needs of\nthe external uh you know the the demands\nof the external environment on that\norganism and being able to manage in\nthat space over time is a very complex\nDynamic\num kind of kind of iterative process and\nwe take those process processes and we\nconjure out of them a form of\nConsciousness an awareness of those\nprocesses that becomes something that\nfeels mentally powerful to us and and I\nthink one of the ways that we can know\nthat what you're saying is right is that\nyou know this is just our first\nexperiment on this but but I think it's\nreally poignant we we we first started\nto study\num the the ways people would react to\nsocial stimuli right to have emotions\nlike Compassion or or admiration in the\nMRI scanner\num by telling people uh stories of true\npeople situations that invoked these\nemotions in all kinds of piloting and\nthen we ask people how does it make you\nfeel and then we can see whether they\nactually feel that way and then we move\nthem into the MRI scanner and ask them\nagain to watch the story and feel it and\nwhat we expected we had some very basic\nhypotheses that things like I'm watching\nsomebody else under physical pain would\nactivate the same systems in your brain\nthat allow you to feel physical pain uh\nand the same with pleasure around\nadmiration for skill by watching\nsomebody do flips on their bike on a\nrailroad tie or whatever it is right um\nor virtue right watching a civil rights\nleader or somebody who does something\nthat's incredibly virtuously powerful\nbut not physically skilled\num and we had a real surprise in those\nfindings which I I think really went\nagainst the prevailing notion of how\nemotion works and which is still\nsomething which I wrestle with trying to\nunderstand so we hypothesized that\nfeeling emotions about very physical\ndirect things and feeling emotions about\nyou know I'm like drawing them in space\nbut feeling emotions about a complex\nelaborated things like compassion for\nsomeone having lost a spouse or\nsomething where you don't see any real\nphysical pain but you can imagine how\nthey're feeling based on your shared\nexperience of loss right or admiration\nfor virtue\num that those things would build uh\nneurobiologically the way that they\nbuild developmentally the way that they\nbuild evolutionarily\num and we did find that to be the case\nand many other groups and experiments\nhave found that too but what was a real\nsurprise to us is that emotions based in\npain and emotions based in something\nrewarding or pleasurable like virtue\nwhich is really inspiring as people\ndescribe it\nwere actually recruiting the same brain\nsystems including the hypothalamus right\nand other systems like the anterior\ninsula which is basically visceral\nsomatomotor cortex it's cortex that\nfeels the state of how you're digesting\nyour lunch whether your heart's pounding\nall these kinds of things right what we\nfound is that these emotions when they\nget complex when they're about Stories\nthe valence is no longer the defining\nfeature the valence doesn't even matter\nthat much instead what matters is does\nthe emotion pertain to a story that is\nconjured in our minds or does it mainly\npertain to what you can directly Witness\nby looking at the person so they step\noff a curb they break their ankle and\nyou go oh that looks like it really hurt\nright versus\nthey're eating dinner alone in a\nrestaurant and somebody tells you his\nspouse died just a month ago right where\nyou have to tell yourself an entire\nstory about how he must be feeling in\nthat situation as compared to just\nlooking at him and seeing the ankle and\ngoing ooh you know and it was that leap\nwhich is really uniquely human which is\nfully developed really throughout a very\nprotracted period right little children\ndo not fully appreciate those kinds of\nmental States yet right and in\nadolescence kids are all about trying to\nconjure and simulate these things and\nthey do it very you know they overdo it\nand they do it in these very sort of\nawkward ways that adults recognize as uh\nyou know uh not likely to correspond\nfully to reality right many times\num and then we start to build more and\nmore facility more and more sort of\nwisdom around Conjuring the story that\nmakes the most direct parsimonious sense\nout of the things that you imagine\nsomebody else may have experienced given\nthe complexities of the context in which\nthey find themselves it becomes more and\nmore Dynamic more and more sort of\ninferential and so this also goes back\nto what you were saying about\ndevelopment this is actually how I see\nDevelopment Across the lifespan my\nlittle two-year-old loves the arm then\nshe loves me as much as something else\nthat she really appreciates like\ndaylight and then she goes on from there\nand when she's 80 God willing someday\nright she'll be making a different kind\nof story picking out things that matter\nin more subtle ways that other people\nmay not notice because of the historical\ncontext because of her her more lived\nexperience that she brings to that story\nright so the things that become Salient\nthe things you learn how to notice and\nbuild a story out of are Developmental\nand they're learned across time\nbut the basic fundamental processes\naround the emotions are always driving\nthe need to make the story\nand so just to come back answering what\nyou said before I think we have this\nincredibly complex Dynamic set of basic\nemotions or whatever you want to call\nthem physiological states that we share\nwith other organisms that are basically\naction programs that teach you run away\nfrom this right move toward that\num eat this don't eat that right but\nthose things in humans and to a lesser\ndegree in other in other animals become\nthe fodder for not just action programs\nin the moment but ideas that transcend\ntime ideas that become the narratives of\nthe stuff of beliefs of values of uh of\nidentities\num those more ethereal you know Essences\nof us that are conjured entirely by us\nin cultural spaces are fundamentally\ngrounded into our ability to experience\nthe world in a real physical embodied\nsense but but allow operated far beyond\nthat I'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers

reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nI started off studying the visual system\nand I don't want this to turn into a\ndiscussion about the visual system but\nin the visual system uh we know that\nthere's a what's called a hierarchical\norganization where the eye encodes and\ncan respond to edges and light versus\ndark and red green blue and from that\nvery basic set of building blocks\nthere's an elaboration or a build up of\nwhat's really called the iceberg model\nthat was developed by my scientific\ngreat grandparents David hebronson\nweasel who won the Nobel Prize for that\nwork\nwhere you can look at somebody's face\nand recognize it or see a profile moving\nat a particular direction and still\nrecognize that person or\num see a word written and and\nconceptualized in your mind's eye what\nthat word like bird actually looks like\nlike parakeet blue parakeet in other\nwords there's a hierarchical buildup and\nwhat you're describing sounds somewhat\nsimilar that there's a hierarchical\norganization whereby through development\nwe we first learned I guess earlier I\ncalled them Primitives but basic\nbuilding blocks of you know when someone\nsteps on my foot it hurts it can hurt a\nlot or a little bit depending on who\nstepped on my foot\num whether I have a shoe on so you start\nlearning context but that there's a\nbuild up on top of the basic somatic\nexperience of different examples that\nmap to pain including emotional pain and\nphysical pain because we know those are\ninterdigitated somewhat\num\nand that over time this builds up so\nthat we have you know countless examples\nbut you added you said something else\nthat's that goes beyond the hierarchical\norganization that we see in the visual\nsystem which is that when there's a\nnarrative or a story that we have to add\nit changes something about the\nrepresentation of emotion I'm I'm so\nstruck by this by this um comparison\nbetween seeing somebody step off a curb\nand break their ankle like even as I'm\ndescribing just like a folding ankle\nlike ouch yeah that really just look at\nwhat you're doing with your face\nright yeah I mean I broke my I've broken\nmy left foot five times growing up doing\nthe same Sport and it just I can still\nhear and feel the thing going and that\nmeans six months in a cast or whatever\nit is\nversus a story you know seeing somebody\nsitting alone in a cafe writing in their\njournal and then you learning that they\njust lost their spouse of 75 years right\ntwo fundamentally different visual\nimages right\nthe emotion could perhaps be the same\nlike oh yes that is rough\nand yet the need to impose story yes\nchanges it do I understand that\ncorrectly that there's something not\njust more\num developmentally mature about adding\nin story and adding context but that\nwhen we have to do that that there's\nsomething that's fundamentally different\nabout how the emotions are mapped in the\nbrain it I guess the perhaps the the\nanswer I'm looking for is what did you\nsee in brain scanning\nexperiments where somebody views a\nsimply a physical break of a somebody's\nlimb versus somebody has to add story is\nthere something that um that comes out\nin the subtraction of one from the other\nthat tells us oh there's a whole set of\nbrain networks that are not just about\nsaying ouch yes but that have to do with\nthe the need to conjure up story and\nwhat what are those brain areas and then\nperhaps we can we can um digest those a\nlittle bit yes and actually that is\nexactly what we found a whole system of\nbrain areas that that did this which now\nmany people have described and we're\nstill trying to understand the full role\nof these Network works but you know\nthese regions together are called in the\nliterature of the so-called default mode\nNetwork right because they were these\nthe the co-activation of these\ncharacteristic regions of the brain\nwhich are in the back middle of the head\nand some characteristic regions in the\nlateral parietal and you know\num you know those were first described\nuh in neuroimaging experiments where\npeople were asked to just rest right\nrest and relax don't think about\nanything just clear your mind for a few\nminutes right this is Marcus rackel and\nhis colleagues back in 2001\num and then and then contrasting that\nwith\num uh tasks where people have to do\nsomething very you know attention focus\nrequiring where you really have to work\nhard and think and they found that these\nhighly metabolic characteristic regions\nof the brain were coming online and\nactivating themselves when the person\nwas resting\nand deactivating and decoupling from one\nanother not talking back and forth and\nexchanging signal very much\num when someone was doing a really\neffortful mental task and that was a\nreal conundrum for a long time and what\nwe now know is you know when you ask\nsomebody to think about nothing or rest\nyou know for a few minutes you're laying\nin the skin or thinking I'm thinking\nabout nothing I'm thinking about nothing\nand then you start daydreaming about all\nmanner of stories you start to imagine\nyourself into the future here I am\nwinning the Olympics Tada you know or\nhey it's my Grandma's birthday next week\nI wonder if she'd like to go to lunch or\nif she'd rather have flowers you know\nyou're imagining other people's mind\nStates you're thinking it's like I'm mad\nat me at work you know or I wonder if I\nshould you know change jobs you know\nyou're thinking about all kinds of\npossible spaces that don't actually\nphysically exist in the real here and\nnow and and so what we found is that our\nfindings were I think some of the first\nif not the first to\nto actively demonstrate\nan increase in activation in these\ndefault mode systems not a decoupling of\nthem but an activation of them when we\nask somebody to do an effortful mental\ntask\nand what was the task asking people how\ndo you feel\nabout this\nstory\nwhich involves a lot of imposing of\ncultural and social and contextual\nknowledge to be able to appreciate so\nthe story of the guy sitting in the cafe\nwriting in his journal uh who lost his\nspouse of 75 years you have to know a\nlot to be able to appreciate how he must\nbe feeling how does it make you feel let\nme pull up a lot of relevant knowledge\npersonal experiences and memories and\nthen hypothesize generate some kind of\nnarrative some kind of storyline that\nwould accommodate his situation and\nallow me to infer those kinds of stories\nwhich are very different from here's\nsomebody stepping off the curb wow look\nat that ankle right it's very obvious\nhow you should how that makes the person\nfeel and how you should feel about that\nyou don't really need to bring a whole\nlot of cultural knowledge about their\nyou know personal history with their\nspouse to be able to understand that's\nbreaking your ankle hurts right and what\nwe found is that it was those kinds of\nstories where people had to bring a lot\nof contextual knowledge to fully\nappreciate that activated these default\nmode systems the spout the losing of the\nsmell losing of the spouse so what we\nlater showed in a series of experiments\num contrasting uh true stories that are\nmeant to induce admiration for skill\nright like something physically skillful\nsomebody can or cognitively skillful and\nmemorize a Rubik's Cube and solve it\nwith your eyes closed right or do flips\non your bicycle and land on a railroad\ntie right like these incredibly skillful\nthings\num as compared to uh uh the same kind of\nbasic emotion in the sense of feeling\nlike inspired\num like attracted to it like it's\npleasurable like it's really cool like\nyou wish you could do that too but now\nit's about a state of that person's mind\nor quality of character or disposition\nof self so talking about the incredibly\nBrave of uh actions of Malala in\nPakistan standing up to the past to the\nto the Taliban right where it's not\nabout how well she walks down the street\nholding her school book there's nothing\nreally physically skillful to see there\nit's about the conditions under what\nshe's doing it and what you can infer\nabout her state of mind and her quality\nof character\nto be engaging in these actions under\nthose conditions and those complex kinds\nof inferences we found\nactivate these default mode systems\nuniquely and in fact we can in trial by\ntrial experiments so literally depending\non what you say about a story whether it\ninspires you that particular story out\nof 50 right in a two-hour interview\nbeforehand if you are inspired by a\nparticular story as compared to another\none which may not resonate with you\nright\num then when we put you in the MRI\nscanner we can predict that you will\nactually activate these neural systems\ndifferentially based on your\npsychological reaction in the interview\nso we can actually show that there are\nsystematic ways in which these\nlarge-scale networks of the brain so the\nway in which the brain's kind of\nbalancing its activity and its crosstalk\naround the different parts that are\ncontributing different kinds of\nprocessing those Dynamic balances are\nare are different when someone is what\nwe're doing what we're calling now\ntranscending the situation of that\nperson right\nand starting to learn something bigger\nabout what it all means or what the\nstory is or the the broader reason why\nthis inspires me\num and not just is about her\nright so you can look at Malala and you\ncan say you know oh uh uh I hope she\nmakes it that's that's that's really\nunfair and I and and like right or you\ncan look at her and say and kids say\nthis to us and experiments with\nteenagers\num but wait a minute and they actually\nwait they cover their face they close\ntheir eyes they look away from the from\nthe Malala video and they look at the\nplane ceiling and we can actually get\ncoders with the volume off to identify\nthese periods of time and say that when\nthey come back from that pause their\nspeech slows their their posture closes\nright they put their hands down that\nkind of thing they don't gesture right\nand when they come back from that they\nare talking about two things they're\ntalking about the broader\ninferential narrative around what all\nthis means wait I didn't know not\neverybody in the world doesn't get to go\nto you know gets to go to school\nyou know that's not right right and and\nthese ethical interpretations that's not\nright and the third thing that comes up\nis a feeling of self and what it means\nfor you because you're using your own\nself and Consciousness as a kind of\nspringboard like a trampoline like we\nsaid before to try to appreciate what it\nmust be like to be her so the next thing\npeople say to us or kids say to us\nespecially is it makes me realize that I\ngo to school all the time and I kind of\ntake it for granted and maybe I should\nwork harder to try to do something about\nthat for other people you know so we\nhave this incredible Confluence in the\nbrain and mind this layering of of of of\nreal physical actions and things that\nhappen that you can directly observe\nwith the visual system right in the\nworld and then you impose upon those a\ndesire to construct a story or meaning\nand you elaborate that meaning and in\ndoing so you also ramp up the internal\nsense of self-aware awareness of me\nbeing me of conscious systems systems\nthat support Consciousness in the brain\nand brain stem very basic things we\nshare with alligators right that become\nthat kind of inspired state of you know\nlike wait it makes me want to do more\nfor the world or it makes me inspired to\nknow there are people like her she gives\nme hope for Humanity one kid told me\nright so we've got this incredible\nDynamic layering of the feeling of the\nbody the real physical body the\nobservation and sensation perception of\nthe world around us in a physical real\nor social real sense and then the\nelaboration of that into these cultural\nnarratives that become feeling States\nand where valence kinds of disappears\nright it doesn't matter so much anymore\nwhether it's painful or pleasurable it's\nmore about does it mean something I'm\nsuffering because it's helping someone\nelse right and so it becomes something\ndesirable even though it hurts me right\notherwise none of us would go through\nchildbirth right and so it's that\nmeaning process that makes us really\nuniquely human and that is the\ndevelopment of these emotions over time\nI think incredible uh if I'm\nunderstanding correctly there's a\nfeeling state in our body when we\nexperience or observe somebody in in\ntheir own feeling state or experience it\nmay be the same as theirs might be\ndifferent and frankly as a\nneuroscientist I'm going to say we'll\nnever know exactly that we won't know\nAngel and philosophical depression we\nwon't if I see blue and you see blue is\nit the same experience it's probably not\nbased on so from knowledge of color\nvision and the distribution of cones to\nexplain why I'm saying that the\ndistribution of cone photo pigments in\nyour eye and my eye are extremely\ndifferent uh to the point where we're\nnot working with the same palette cool\nand I think that makes life interesting\nlife interesting exactly but assuming\nthat neither of us is colorblind red is\nsimilar enough to both of us that we\nboth look at it and say that's red but\none in 80 males is red green colorblind\nwould look at it and would\num see what you and I call Red and call\nit Orange\nin any event\nwhen we let's say listen to or watch and\nlisten to Martin Luther King's classic I\nHave a Dream speech\num or when I hear certain music that I\nfirst heard when I was 14. I was a\nparticularly interesting for me time in\nmy life in part because I was 14 and\nwe'll get back to that it's 14. we're\ntalking about adolescents right I I'll\njust say I'll go on record by saying\nthat the I think that the music that we\nlisten to in our adolescents and teen\nyears\nis one of the main ways in which we\ncome to recognize the extremes of these\nfeeling State templates that you're\ndescribing I can one of the ways I\nprepare for podcasts is\num is to walk and and for my solo\npodcast is to walk and go through some\nof the narrative my neighbors think I'm\ncrazy\num but that's okay I think they're crazy\ntoo\num maybe they're both right okay that's\nright exactly and um but I I always know\nwhat music to listen to before I do a\nsolo podcast depending on the state that\nI happen to be in driving into the\nstudio versus the one I need to be in in\norder to deliver that particular\nmaterial and I know because I it's\nalmost like knowing what palette of\ncolors or emotional colors I have in me\nat the moment and which ones are going\nto be required to deliver that material\num because it's different depending on\nthe on the topic matter for that episode\nwhat I'm referring to here is is this\nidea that\num you know we we come to understand\nemotions through our own experience and\nhow observing other people and listening\nto certain music can influence that and\nI I realize that some people probably\nhave more of a buffer between their um\nexperience of the outside world\nso-called like steroception seeing\nthings outside us\num and their internal landscape\num some people I realize have very\nlittle narrative distancing in fact I\nlive with someone who has very little\nnarrative distancing when she watches a\nmovie if the person gets punched yeah\nshe Ducks she she flinches\num if it's a happy movie she gets happy\nyeah if somebody in a movie is sad she\nreally feels it and for a while I\nthought goodness you know this is like\nreally seems a little extreme but I've\ntalked to professionals about this and\nit's something called lack of narrative\ndistancing transportation is another way\nto say it yeah being transported by\nstory right and and I think that it has\nits adaptive utility I'm not being\ncritical I think that's an incredibly\ninteresting aspect to ourselves some of\nus I have a lot more narrative\ndistancing especially with violence and\nI yeah I think that's because I grew up\naround a lot more violence than she did\nand so I see somebody you know get\nbeheaded in a film and I and I unless\nit's something where I've really been\nbuilt into the story of that person and\nit was a real world thing that I knew\nactually happened then I I just kind of\ngo okay well it's a movie you know\nthere's a movie it's not real even if\nit's a movie about something that was\nreal that might be a little bit more of\nan emotional impact and of course if\nit's a documentary and it's real footage\nit's pretty rough yeah but I don't\num I'm not horrified in the in the way\nthat she's horrified I'm horrified but\nnot to the same extent\num so obviously that some of us have\nmore of a buffer than others and you can\nsee this in a movie or in a classroom\nfull of kids watching a a speech like\nthe eye of a Dream speech or hearing the\nRosa Parks story or for instance or\num listening to and watching a David\nGoggins social media post which I met\nDavid earlier because your son had a\nquestion for me about David Goggins who\nI happened to um have the Good Fortune\nof of having met and know a little bit I\ndon't know him very well but I know\num in from some in-person interactions\nand he is every bit as intense and every\nbit as serious about his\num ongoing progression as he appears to\nbe there there's there's no false so\nthere it is 100 data fact genuine he\ndoes what he claims to do and more yeah\num that we don't hear about\nsuper impressive human being so when we\nsee something like a David Goggins post\nor we watch and listen to the I Have a\nDream speech and we start to feel\nsomething yeah like whoa we're feeling\ninspired to use the basic language are\nwe mapping to some subconscious\nawareness of that in ourselves\num meaning are we mapping to some time\nwhen we felt inspired in another\ncircumstance or are we really\nyou know is this merely a kind of a\nreturn to a feeling state that we have\nto recognize I don't know if experiments\nhave ever been done on this but is there\nany way to to determine whether or not\nwe can truly have novel emotions past\nage 15.\num or are we really just returning for\nthat matter are we really just doing a\nsort of template matching of wow I'm\nfeeling this again and and this makes me\nfeel capable like I can go out and run\ntoday even though I was gonna basically\nnot run today\num or you know it's possible to have a a\nfantasy view about how the world could\nbe in terms of\num equality that um an opportunity and\nyou know what like I that's\nsubconsciously is my brain saying yeah I\nremember when I was six and and I didn't\nknow the difference between some people\nhaving an opportunity and other people\nnot having opportunity\num is that what's happening or do you\nthink that we are more sophisticated\nthan that and we are actually really\num uh responding to what we think we're\nresponding to\nokay so wow there's a lot in there\num a couple a couple of things to start\nso the the first thing I was thinking\nbefore when you were talking about the\nvisual system which I think is relevant\nnow\num is is that as humans the more\ndeveloped we get the more experience we\nhave the more um we've adapted to the\ncontexts in which we live you know the\nreal physical context in this case the\nvisual context included\num but also the cultural values of that\ncontext the things we've noticed other\npeople notice right how do you learn\nwhen you're living in the jungle that\nwhen you see eyeballs you should you\nknow go stand next to your mommy right\num so you learn what to notice you learn\nwhat what you need to attend to in the\nworld and you're so when we are\nperceiving things\neither very basic things like a visual\nscene or hugely complex elaborate things\nlike uh Martin Luther King's speech we\nare as much imposing onto the world our\nown expectations of\nwhat is there as we are perceiving\nwhat's actually there right so as we\nimpose onto the world we bring what you\nmight call our cultural ways of seeing\nand knowing our values and beliefs and\nwe push them onto the experience of what\nwe notice so even in very basic ways\nthings like cultural values uh change\nthe way in which people observe and\nremember scenes right so you know\nthere's classic work by shinobu kirayama\nand other people showing that in Japan\nversus in uh in the U.S uh when you show\npeople a scene of um you know like an\nunderwater scene with like all the\nbeautiful things that are underwater\nrocks and plants and things and the\nlittle fish swimming by and then one big\nfish swimming by right and you ask a\nJapanese person uh what's this a picture\nof they tend to talk about it's a scene\nof rocks and plants and little fish and\nthen a big fish swims by\num if you ask an American uh Western\neducated person what is this picture of\nthey say oh it's a fish swimming through\na scene right we we tend to notice first\nand you can he's shown that this is you\nknow is very very automatic it's very\nlow level it's perceptual not just\nconceptual and it actually changes what\npeople actually notice in the scene and\nwhat they remember later and all that\nkind of stuff right we learn how to\nsort of filter input we're not little\nyou know uh robots or little uh video\ncameras walking around observing the\nworld and so when we see something as\ncomplex as a social story We impose onto\nthat all kinds of personal experiences\nso you said are we ever able to\nexperience new emotions after age 15 I\nthink no but we are very well able to\nexperience new feelings right which are\nthe complex elaborations of these\nphysiological States and the stories we\ntell ourselves about the meaning behind\nthem that is developing all the time and\nit's developing through all kinds of\nquote-unquote cognitive media we do it\nthrough our science right by being\ninspired and interested in something by\nbeing in awe of something we do it\nthrough ART through trying to express an\nemotion or a feeling or a value State\nthrough the way in which we portray\nsomething to other people right as\nhumans we are driven I mean even as cave\npeople we were driven to say I was here\nhere's my handprint I'm going to spit it\nonto a rock so forevermore anybody else\ncomes in here is going to see that it\nwas me who was here and I have a me\nright and so what we're really doing is\nmoving through the world not in this\nkind of receptive passive way but we are\nactively imposing ourselves onto the\nworld we're actively bringing our\ninterpretive power and adapting what we\ndo next relative to the way in which we\naccommodate right Piaget talked about\nthis 100 years ago accommodate or\nassimilate those things into us that we\nthat that may disagree with our schema\nthat may uh that may align in accord and\nreinforce them so this matters a lot for\nthe ways that humans experience the\nworld more broadly because\nthink about for example\num a terrible topic like genocide or the\nHolocaust right how does something like\nthat happen right how is it that people\nwho have empathy who who love their\nfamily who love their neighbors can\nsuddenly turn on each other right what's\nhappened is they've shifted the way in\nwhich they naritize the context of those\nevents the way in which they impose\ninterpretation on somebody else's pain\nhas been fundamentally shifted from\nthat's another human suffering too\nthat's not a human that's a a rat a pig\na bug or whatever it is right and that\ndehumanization process allows us to\nshift our story set so that we bring\nanother set of values and beliefs into\nthe space\num can I just say I'm I'm glad that you\nbrought up that dark example yeah\nbecause my understanding from my\npsychology courses in University where\nthat as much as we would all like to\nthink that we are incapable of being the\ncommitters of genocide that there are\nstudies that were done in the 50s but\nthen have been repeated over many\ndecades showing that\num in certain contexts\num essentially everybody and anybody\nwould respond to an authoritarian figure\nand torture somebody else and I'm sure\nas people are listening to us this\nthey're thinking no I would absolutely\nnot do that but all the data points to\nthe fact that if the conditions were set\nin a particular way\num you and I and everybody else most\ncertainly would a very eerie idea that\ngoes back to I think Young's idea that\nwe have all things inside of us and we\ncertainly have all the neural circuitry\ncomponents inside of us for um rage and\ncontempt and um and horrible\nmistreatment of others as well as all\nthe good stuff\num but I I'm just glad that you brought\nup this example because\num I think that for a lot of people it's\nit's inconceivable but I've never heard\nit framed the way that you're describing\nit which is that if the story becomes\nnot about the other person's suffering\nbut primarily about One's Own Story of\nsuffering and that can suppress or\nliterally inhibit the neural circuits\nthat invoke empathy\nuh then it makes perfectly good\nneurobiological sense as to why that\nwould at least be possible yeah and of\ncourse I don't think it's a good thing\nit's just like many aspects of our\nbiology and psychology it just happens\nto be the way things are\nit is and I I think it really I think I\nmean I'm the ever The Optimist I'm also\never the educator right I I you know I'm\na teacher I'm very also very interested\nin the ways that we design educational\nexperiences for young people I think the\nonly hope we have to protect ourselves\nagainst these possibilities\nis to systematically develop\ndispositions in ourselves proclivities\nwithin ourselves to question our own\nmotives and to deconstruct our own\nassumptions about situations and to\nengage with other people's perspectives\nsystematically and when we develop those\ndispositions\nthe hope is that we are developing\nwithin ourselves a kind of\num uh a veto system right a system for\nchecking our own motivations against\nother people's experiences of those\nmotivations and\nyou know so much of what's leading I\nthink so now we're going in another\nDirection and kind of a political\nDirection but so much what's leading us\ninto these very divisive political types\nfor example not just and you know the\nrise of authoritarianism not just in the\nU.S uh or the threat of it not just in\nthe U.S but around many places in the\nworld all of which by the way are\nWestern educated\num uh is that we are taught that to know\nsomething means you own something in\nyourself and then you take that with you\nand you impose it on the world\nforevermore I know how to do algebra two\nand I can do it whenever you ask me kind\nof thing and that's what a good student\nis where when people in learn to engage\nwith their own knowledge States in in\nmore Curious open-minded flexible ways\nthen we dispositionally teach ourselves\nto to check our assumptions to rethink\nwhat we think we know and and this is\nkey developmentally to notice when we\nneed to do that and when we should just\nplay ahead and it's totally fine and and\nso what we're doing I think right now to\nourselves both in the education system\nand in things like social media is we're\nreinforcing our own biases by diving\ndown rabbit holes where you re-hear the\nsame thing over and over again that\nreinforces your own belief systems and\nthen you come to believe those things\nand those put you on a train toward a\nparticular kind of action or belief\nsystem that never becomes deconstructed\nand it's very comfortable and it's easy\nto do but the responsibility I think we\nhave as individuals and as groups as\nhumans given the amazing intelligence we\nhave is to rise above that and actually\nlook back on our own selves reflectively\nand deconstruct our preferences\ndeconstruct our values and our beliefs\nand systematically query them\nspecifically around how they impact or\ninfluence or or or change the situations\nof those around us or don't right the\nsituations and sustainability of the\nworld that supports us or don't and so\nit all comes back to the emotions that\ndrive our thinking so we have these very\nbasic primitive physiological states\nwhich vary across individuals the degree\nto which they are you know incredibly\npowerful easily evoked versus not you\nknow there's a lot of range in that now\nall of that variation makes things\ninteresting right\num but it's our ability to learn to\nexperience those\nand to know develop wisdom around when\nwe need to query our own emotions and\ndeconstruct the narratives that are that\nwe're using to validate or substantiate\nthose kinds of emotions\nin order to assess whether we actually\nare right whether we should continue or\nwhether we should step back and and and\nand and and reframe right and so that\nkind of mental flexibility really comes\nout of an emotional disposition it is\nour ability so it takes it back to what\nyou're asking at the very beginning it\nis our ability to not just drive from\nwhat feels like the bottom up which of\ncourse is always starting in the top\ndown because you've got some\ninterpretation of the world that makes\nyou feel fear and that makes your body\ndo this that makes you right\num but also to be able to rise above to\ntranscend\nand think about what are the broader\nsystemic historical uh uh ethical Civic\nimplications of this narrative I'm\ntelling myself which feels default like\nthe truth and how might I deconstruct\nthose systematically and how might I\ninvite others to give me their version\nof those events and engage with those\nsystematically in order to be able to\nreally appreciate the implications of my\nbeliefs and\nso the bottom line is that the emotions\nthat we're talking about today are\nactually the fundamental drivers of all\nof our thinking decision-making\nrelationship building right our\ncommunity lives and our personal\nwell-being all in one mix but that\ndoesn't kind of excuse us for acting on\ntheir bequest it actually imbues us with\na responsibility to then develop\ndispositions to systematically query\nthose and reframe them when they are not\nserving us or the world well\nexactly what you said\nso much so that you know I I'm a big\nbeliever in following lots of different\ntypes of social media accounts yeah I've\ntaken some heat here and there yeah\nbecause people automatically assume that\nif you follow an account that you\nsubscribe to that ideology but I follow\nmany accounts to whom I disagree with\nwhat they say specifically so that I can\nlearn different perspectives as far as I\nknow we're the same species me and these\nother people yes as far as we are and\nsometimes I wonder but um they probably\nwonder the same way about me they Wonder\ntoo\num and there's enormous range in in\nthose uh those accounts that I follow\num and I follow different accounts for\ndifferent reasons some for entertainment\nsome for information some for\nchallenging myself some for um my desire\nto be baffled every now and again but to\nalways return to this idea that we're\nall we are all basically working with\nthe same building blocks of neurons and\nneurochemistry some people's dopamine\nwhich whether or not you're into Bitcoin\nor\num traditional currency uh the one true\ncurrency that's Universal is dopamine\neveryone's working for dopamine and\nexchanging their own dopamine with World\nexperiences\nbut this is one of the reasons why I\nthink it's important to not be siled in\none's thinking or exposure to different\nthings on social media a somewhat\ncontroversial statement actually because\nI think a lot of people assume that if\nyou follow somebody from a particular\npolitical party then that means that you\nvote that political party\nEtc\num but that to me always seemed crazy\nI'm fortunate to have a good friend who\nis on this podcast Rick Rubin who's a\nextremely accomplished music producer\nand instead produced music from\nessentially every genre of music punk\nrock which is what our story I got my\nstart and still love punk rock music so\nmuch but classical and Hip-Hop and\neverything in between and Rick is\nsomebody who forages so broadly and I've\nreally learned to try and forage broadly\nin terms of ideas and ideologies and\nit's I think a lot of people are just\nscared to be exposed to something that\nthey hate so much because they don't\nlike that feeling in their body of of\ndisagreement\num but yeah dissonance is very uh you\nknow that kind of cognitive dissonance\nwe call it is very difficult it takes\nwork to resolve it yeah I I guess is is\nthere I like to think there's a way to\nstep back from that and observe it not\nfrom a disconnected stance but from a\nplace of curiosity about what's driving\nthe those mechanisms in people and and\nmaybe where we need to adjust our\nthinking maybe not to adopt their mode\nof thinking 100 but maybe you know 10 or\n2 I think one of the the reasons things\nare so divisive right now is because of\nsocial media and the siloing or of kind\nof Orchard very um Divergent\ntrajectories of people only following\nand listening to and obeying certain\nkinds of information and other people\nthe other and I think the pandemic is\nthe place where all that really clashed\nvery heavily\num and continues to Clash\nin other areas too\num certainly not something that's going\nto be solved um inside of this\nconversation and yet I do have\num a question that that grows from this\naspect of our discussion which is you\nknow what do you think can be done at a\nconcrete level\nin terms of Education of younger people\nas well as educational people who are\nout of high school\nand and Beyond to try and adopt these\nmore um encompassing modes of of\nlearning and experiencing the world I\nmean it's one thing to say you know\nexpose yourself to lots of different\nideas\num it's another to to understand how to\nhow to do that in a way that that is um\nadaptive and that any ideas you have\num I think what I know I and the\naudience would really appreciate and and\nfeel free to to\num make this an editorial\num or or map back to data I mean\nobviously this is your wheelhouse this\nis this is your expertise so I'm curious\nwhat what should we do should should I\nsend my family members who have very\nDivergent political beliefs from me um\ninformation\num to the to the contrary they're\nthinking or should what do I do and what\ndo I do for me what should we all be\ndoing with our 10 year olds and our yeah\nand ourselves\nwell I won't I won't comment on should\nyou send your family members your\nthere's other people that do that and\nthey they do that work and they know how\nthey're always frustrating each other\nover text message it's okay it's okay it\ncan't get any worse yeah no okay we all\nlove each other anyway\nbut one thing I really do think a lot\nabout in this is\num the way in which we educate our young\npeople and what do we do with our 10\nyear olds right and like the first thing\nI'll say about your time well I don't\nknow if you actually have a 10 year old\nbut is um is is query them about their\nbeliefs when they follow something when\nthey think something's impressive or bad\nor you know ask them why teach them to\nunpack their own beliefs that doesn't\nmean that you that you don't still hold\nthem necessarily it doesn't mean that\nyou adopt the opposite belief right if I\ntalk to someone who has a very different\nvalue system than I do and I disagree\nwith them that's legitimate but two it\nalso but but in deciding that I disagree\nI have sort of Revisited my own belief\nand queried it I've I've externalized it\na little bit made that thinking visible\nis why we talk about it in education\nthat's David Perkins at Harvard talks\nabout it that way you know making your\nthinking visible and then examining that\nthinking and and so\nI think\none really important step that a society\nwill have to take or we won't make it\nand I know that sounds a little\num dramatic but I actually think it's\ntrue sadly uh and I'm starting to think\nit's more and more true is that we need\nto really get Brave about how we think\nabout the process of educating our young\npeople and what it actually means to\nexpose young people to developmentally\nappropriate\nage-appropriate\nopportunities to grow themselves as\nthinkers as individuals and as Civic\nagents and community members I I think\nthat our\nWestern designed\neducation system\nhas in it some very basic beliefs about\nwhat counts as knowing and what is worth\nthinking about and knowing about and how\ndo I know that\nhow do I test you on that that I think\nis deeply they are deeply problematic\nand lead us I mean I know this is a\nstrong statement but they lead us to a\nplace where we are\nwe are actively punished not just not\nencouraged but I would say actively\ndiscouraged from\nreally playing with ideas\nengaging systematically with our own\nbeliefs deconstructing those beliefs and\nengaging with complex perspectives on\ntopics and ideas that is just not what\nschool is about\nand it needs to be we need to shift so\nright now the way in which we think\nabout\nschool is about is basically judged by\nquote unquote learning outcomes right\nwhat have you learned and how do we know\nthat we make you demonstrate it by\nyourself under time pressure in a\nparticular setting right or you're going\nto come back and I'm going to give you a\nquestion and you're going to give me the\nanswer I had in mind and if you do that\nin time then I'll say you learned it and\nnow we're done check right\nas compared to\na system and there are Educational\nSystems like this this is not\num there are people for example the\nperformance uh assessment Consortium in\nNew York City is a Consortium of public\nschools some of which do this\nextraordinarily well they have a a\ndispensation from the New York state\ngovernment uh not to give the Regents\nexam as their graduation requirements\num and their um and and their their\nbenchmarks of learning but instead to\nhave alternative ways of assessing kids\nwhere kids work for months to years\ndepending on the project on these\nin-depth intellectual multi-disciplinary\nprojects where they explore a topic and\nthey engage with their own process of\nlearning about that topic and they bring\nin teachers and Community experts and\nother people and they present their work\nand then they query the work and they\ntalk about their own learning process\nand what could happen next and what\ndecisions they made and all these kinds\nof things exactly you have to invent not\njust the work but the question\nlook at the world and notice what it is\nwe're not understanding that we would\nbenefit from understanding and find a\nway to to isolate and systematically\nquery that why don't we build education\nsystems from preschool all the way up\nthat in that engage people\nsystematically in that kind of\nintellectual curiosity we don't do that\nso we we know that little kids education\npreschool education if you don't have\nthe water table in the sand table and\nthe cool stuff and the choices and the\nways to engage with each other and you\nknow I mean all the stuff being really\nage appropriate for three-year-olds to\ntouch and smoosh and you know try to\ntaste and whatever else they're going to\nbe a mess on the floor they're just not\ngoing to come they're going to refuse to\ncome to school right and they're going\nto be laying in the in the doorway\nthrowing temper tantrums right but as so\nwe know how to do little kid education\nwell it doesn't mean we always do it but\nwe know that they need to be intrigued\nthey need to be invited to think and\nthey bring their Natural Curiosity and\nthen you expand the range of ways they\ncan leverage that Curiosity to discover\nnew things they hadn't known to think\nabout before right\nthen we get to the standard\nquote-unquote educational system and we\nsomehow think that that natural human\nproclivity to engage curiously and\nmeaningfully with deep thinking about\nideas and the world\nis is like inefficient and inappropriate\nand frightening and we teach kids no no\nno no no turn that off it's it's it's\ndangerous if you do it it's considered\ninsubordinate right and what we want to\ninstead to do is just let me give you\nwhat I've already figured out for you\nI'm going to give it to you and you are\ngoing to give it back to me so it seems\nto me that in the way that things\nactually happen in school what is\ncreated is\nkind of desire for the kid to be a\ncomputer not a human and they do have a\ndopamine system however and so what\nbecomes the the buzz the emotional Buzz\nis performance yes if it becomes a buzz\nat all so for the kids that don't get\nthat buzz from performance or they don't\nor they don't intrinsically love the\nmath or the English or the books that\nthey're being presented with or or\nwhatever the subject happens to be\num or maybe they only like one or two\nthings then they emotionally dissociate\nfrom the rest of the material I'm\nactually describing a bit of myself in\nhigh school I I was not I barely\nfinished high school\num I dropped out of sixth grade for a\nfew months yeah didn't work for me yeah\nyou know I eventually got back to it and\nand as I imagine you did too um so we\nended up as academics but um I think\nwhat you're describing is so key\num and I never thought about it from the\nperspective of oh yeah as young kids\nlike we're given all the things that are\ngoing to drive our sensory World\num in the appropriate ways top watch and\nsound and um\nwe're trying to build meaning in our\nmind and that we get to um as students\nyoung very Young Learners impose some of\nour own\num intrinsic motivation to do certain\nthings and not others and that that\nisn't supported as we're adults I'd like\nto take a quick break and thank our\nsponsor inside tracker inside tracker is\na personalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals a long\nbeen a believer in getting regular blood\nwork done for the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term Health can only\nbe assessed with a quality blood test\nthe problem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that they'll\ngive you information about certain lipid\nmarkers or hormone markers but no\ninformation about what to do with all of\nthat data inside tracker makes it very\neasy to look at your levels of hormones\nmetabolic factors lipids Etc and then to\nassess what sorts of Behavioral\nnutritional supplementation or perhaps\nother interventions you might want to\nuse in order to bring those numbers into\nthe ranges that are optimal for your\nhealth inside tracker's ultimate plan\nnow includes three new hormone markers\nthat are critical to measure during a\nwoman's reproductive and menopausal\nyears these are estradiol progesterone\nand thyroid stimulating hormone if you'd\nlike to try inside tracker you can go to\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside trackers plans again\nthat's inside tracker.com huberman to\nget 20 off\nwhat you're describing is so vital what\nage do you think this um Cliffs off so\nyou okay so in preschool kids are\nallowed to do this in kindergarten\nthey're allowed to do a first grade\nthey're allowed to do it in most schools\nbut at what point do is the expectation\nimposed on kids to become little rote\num um learning computer machines and to\nget their dopamine from\num performance rather from intrinsic\npleasure in what they're learning\nthinking about you and also how do we\naddress this issue that there are\ncertain basic skills that not everyone\nis going to perform well at and so for\nthe kid that says I don't like math well\nyou still have to learn it you need to\nappreciate it how do you so how do you\nconjure up in a a joy or an appreciation\nin that kid I mean it seems like a hard\nthing I mean I eventually set myself\nalong a academic trajectory\num to that worked out\num but that was initially just out of\npure fear because my life was was really\nbad I made circumstances and myself made\nit bad and I was rescuing myself from\nbasically becoming more of a loser so I\nwas like okay school's the thing and I\njust school and that was that was the\nturn hard right into into academics for\nme but what do you do for the person who\nis like really doesn't like math because\nthey're struggling with it or doesn't\nlike biology or psychology I mean how do\nwe how do we evoke a at least an\nappreciation for that\num it sounds like the emotion system is\nthe key system to leverage in order to\nlearn and and so could you talk about\nthe relationship between emotion and\nlearning yeah because I realize this is\nreally the the center of what you do so\nI mean you could say it this way right\nso whatever you're having emotion about\nis what you're thinking about\nright and whatever you're thinking about\nyou could hope to learn about remember\nsomething from right understand\ndifferently so the key question for\neducators is what everybody's always\nhaving some kind of emotions all the\ntime if those are dead right or\nunconscious what are people's emotions\nabout in this space\nif the emotions because whatever those\nemotions about that is what you're\nlearning about so if the emotions are\nabout the outcomes did I get it right am\nI going to flonk and I can make plus I'm\nso smart I'm so stupid well any one of\nthose right if those are the main\ndrivers then that is what you're\nlearning about\nif the emotions are about the actual\nideas in play the math the physics the\nwhy does the ball roll down the ramp\nwait a minute that's the same as why the\nmoon goes around you know what I mean\nlike there are right when the emotions\nare about ideas then what you're\nengaging with is learning about ideas\nand so what I would argue is that in\nsetting up the kind of accountability\nsystem we have we have taught people\nthat their emotion should be about these\nhigh-stakes accountability measures\nwhich means that's what we're learning\nhow to think about perform perform not\nhow to think about the ideas not the\nintrinsic power of using math to\nunderstand the world in a different way\nso how do you engage kids right you\nengage kids by setting out Rich problem\nspaces that but in problems that invite\nthem to try to engage with something\nthat piques your curiosity that's\nmeaningful to them or have them bring in\nwell the kid who really hates it like\nwhat is it that you do find interesting\nkid right start there\nstart there and start using your your\nacademic skills in a way that will give\nyou power to do what it is you're\ninterested in doing that's the way in\nuse your writing use your math use your\npersuasive argument skills use your\nfilmmaking skills whatever it is to tell\nthe story of something that you find\ndeeply meaningfully powerful to\nunderstand and all of a sudden you need\nthe math kids actually say things like\nlike there's this lovely\num there's this lovely uh long quote\nfrom a from a Sudanese immigrant kid in\none of these New York schools uh with\nthe performance assessments\num uh in a in an article I wrote with a\ncolleague named Doug connect\num the article is called building\nmeaning builds teens brains you can find\nit in educational leadership there's a\nbig long quote from this kid at the end\nand he's basically explaining what math\nclass meant to him which he had never\npassed a math class before and he says\nhe got this problem called walking to\nthe door which is basically Zeno's\nParadox right you get halfway to the\ndoor halfway to the door halfway there\ndo you ever get to the door why or why\nnot right and they spent months learning\nthe math that would help them get at\nthat problem and he talks about how I\nhad a problem he says and I had to learn\nfractions I had to in order to be able\nto solve the problem I had and as I\nengaged with fractions and that problem\nI got fascinated he says by finite and\ninfinite and these ideas were driving my\nneed to learn to do fractions right so\nwe've got the cart before the horse I'm\nnot saying you don't have to learn math\nor you don't have to learn to read or\nwrite or or do all these other kinds of\nskills but we make those which is in the\nhorse's cart you know what's in the cart\nwe call that the the metric of the\neducation system and the aim of it when\nin fact it's the quality of the horse\ncan that horse pull the thing right\nthat's the development of the person and\nwhat they put in their cart then serves\nthat development it's the toolkit of\nways of knowing and understanding that\ncome with you as you move into the world\nbut this this takes real real\ndevelopmental skill on the part of\nEducators right who are not supported or\nor or resourced or trained to think\nabout development in these ways I mean\nso you asked when does this fall off it\nreally depends on what school system you\nare and what demographic you are when it\nfalls off but for almost everybody\nexcept for the privileged few uh who are\nin very Progressive alternative schools\nit falls off by adolescence which is\nwhen school gets serious and it's also\nironically when developmentally kids are\ndeveloping the neural capacity and the\npsychosocial capacity and the drive to\ninfer complex narrative meaning from the\nthings they are doing you know these\naren't just my shoes these are a\nstatement about you know what I believe\nabout sustainability and about sports\nand about adults and Counter Culture\nright and as we grow into a space where\nwe're driven to try to you know\nChallenge and think about big meanings\nand engage with perspectives and\nemotions and social issues and Broad\nimportant existential questions be they\nin physics or be they in art or be they\nin the social Civic domain right\nwhat do we do\nwe double down on controlling the input\nand the output transactional mechanisms\nthat count as quote-unquote academic\nrigor and achievement right we start to\nask kids you know what's the name of the\nthe servant who shows up in the scene\nand and Great Expectations right is it\nMolly or is it Maria right and it's you\nknow like who the heck knows and that is\nnot the point of reading Great\nExpectations right we take away because\nwe're afraid as Educators as Society\nwe've got this narrative around\nyoung peoples and particular but\neveryone's propensity to build and\nconstruct\nmeaning in these spaces and self in\nthese spaces that agency frightens us\nbecause we're worried they're going to\ntake risks they're going to do something\nstupid they're going to they're going to\nfall off the track they're gonna not\nmake it in the traditional system\nand in trying to protect them and shield\nthem from their own Curiosities their\nown dispositions for meaning making we I\nwould argue actually stunt their ability\nto grow themselves to the point where we\nhave mental health crises literally\ncrises in in mental health right now in\nadolescence across demographic groups\nespecially bad in young girls as I\nunderstand yes that's right but but\nafter that in everybody and it's worse\nthan girls yes we don't fully understand\nwhy that is\num uh got some you know suggestions uh\nyou know what we're really doing is\nactually\nproducing people who are gutted of their\nown inner drive to become\nsomeone who thinks powerfully in the\nspace of the world we are frightened to\nlet our young people have that power\nwhich is the role of adults is to wrap\naround young people and help them learn\nto to be reflective to be systematic to\nbe rigorous with themselves as they\ndevelop the capacities and dispositions\nto deconstruct their own beliefs to\ndeconstruct their own aims and goals and\nthe ways they understand the world and\nto rebuild them iteratively over and\nover in this in this sort of\nintellectually humble curious way where\nwe're constantly querying ourselves\nconstantly querying other people where\nwe're willing to sit with uncertainty in\ncomplex problem spaces and think through\nthe possibilities rather than settle\nquickly onto one solution what does\nschool expect you to do settle\nimmediately onto one solution which by\nthe way is the solution I already had in\nmind when I gave you the question right\nright as compared to\nsitting with young people and allowing\nthem this in safe and appropriate ways\nthe space in which to actually grapple\nwith complex powerful questions when\nkids develop the proclivities to do that\nthey learn how to manage those very\nhuman capacities that we've been talking\nabout the whole time that can lead to\nyou know terrible evil as well as\namazing virtuousness they learn to\nappreciate and manage those capacities\nwithin their own selves I think so much\nof what we see in terms of these you\nknow quote unquote Failure to Launch\nexamples are are because I know some of\nthese the children of friends\num really really smart kids that didn't\nmap well to the system\nand therefore are not doing well really\nstruggling and um clearly have the\nintellectual power it just wasn't served\nup to them and uh School wasn't served\nup to them in a way that worked yeah\nthat says as much about the system as it\ndoes about the kid right yeah I I teach\na course at um Stanford to the medical\nstudents that every first year medical\nstudent takes about Neuroscience it's\nteam taught it's a phenomenal course\num because of the the range of expertise\nuh in the teaching\num that comes through and one thing I've\nnoticed\num is that the they're all phenomenal\nteachers\num but the best instructors\num do two things simultaneously when\nthey teach first of all they come to the\ntable with Incredible expertise\nobviously we understand what you're\ntrying to get at if you want people to\nengage with ideas yeah they are true\nluminaries in their respective Fields\naddiction pain memory uh every system of\nthe of the the body and brain that\nrelates to the nervous system is taught\nin this course but that I've noticed\nevery once in a while that um there's a\nsubset of them that as they teach from\nthat position of expertise not only are\nthey clear not only are they engaging\nnot only are there slides\num sparse enough to understand but Rich\nenough to include all the relevant\ndetail but they also flip back and forth\nin from the position of expert to the\nposition of novice learning it for the\nfirst time that's almost that\nintellectual curiosity that they're\nkeeping a lot they have this disposition\nwe're talking about cultivating sorry to\ncut you off no please do um as academics\nwe're familiar with that right interrupt\ninterrupting in the landscape of\nacademics interrupting me is is a sign\nof Interest I think Carol I think Carol\ndweck was the one who told me that she\nokay she's right and she's right yeah\nshe's right um the great Carol dweck\nyeah and so\num but I've seen this especially so you\nknow there are some topics that um you\nknow I like to think that I'm I might do\nthis reflexively for because like for\ninstance I started off in neural\ndevelopment and I adore the topic so I\ncan't teach neural development without\nbeing completely\nblown away in the positive sense of how\na brain develops yeah I've still never\ntalked about this I've done a podcast on\nit um because it tends to require\nvisuals\num and we don't use those in the because\nthe podcast guys most people listen to\nthe podcast but maybe I'll do something\njust for YouTube at some point but that\nI think it's this the same experience\noccurs when I see somebody\num like uh Dr Sean Mackey who runs our\nour pain clinic at Stanford teach about\npain and the systems of the body that\nrelate to pain and emotion and how to\ncure certain forms of pain Etc treat\npain it's like he's he's clearly the\nworld expert but the way he describes a\nsystem you can tell he's he's learning\nit again for the first time in parallels\nall of that and I feel like that ignites\nthe emotional systems of the learner's\nbrain in such a powerful way\num that is distinct from just hearing an\nexpert talk about something he's not\nrelaying he's not a squirrel with nuts\nand giving all the nuts to the kids he's\ninventing the knowledge in front of them\nright that's a great way to put it um as\nusual\num others are more succinct in\ncollecting my ideas than and expressing\nthem than I am\num so I think that's a that's a powerful\nthing I went to a high school that's uh\nhas a kind of a split reputation it's\nknown as being one of the best public\nhigh schools in the country it's also\nthe high school that at least for a\nwhile had one of the highest suicide\nrates in the country it's written up in\nvarious uh newspapers and and so on\num and so much so that nowadays they\nforbid the kids there from meeting uh\nmore than an hour before school to\npractice for the standardized test by\nthe way when I was at school the only\nthing that school represented for me in\nhigh school was something that came\nbetween breakfast and skateboarding and\na lot and frankly I wasn't in school a\nlot and I don't recommend that kids go\nto school stay in school I I missed a\nlot of school I had a lot of them did\nall kinds of weird things there's a lot\nof making up to do in college\num as a consequence so stay in school\nget the basics um but this is actually\nwhere I'd like to go you have a very\ninteresting trajectory yeah you're our\nUniversity Professor you\num study emotion and learning and many\nother things across cultures and\num adolescence and and so many other\nimportant topics but um you are not a\nstory of of like growing up in an\nacademic family you grew up on a farm\num sort of gentleman's Farm my dad was a\nsurgeon but we had animals in a farm and\ntried my parents tried to have us you\nknow growing the things we ate you've\nhad a number of different experiences\nthat we were talking about before we\nstarted recording but but one of the\nthings that you mentioned was getting\ninvolved in education\num where you were exposed to students of\nwho had very different backgrounds than\nyou\num maybe you could just talk a little\nbit about\num sort of the nodes of your experience\nso you grew up on this farm and then\nmaybe just hit some of the other nodes\nand and then let's let's take a foray\ninto when you first got exposed to\neducating others yeah um and because I\nthink that's an important backdrop for\nwhat uh what we've been talking about\nhere and service is a jumping off point\nfor where I'd like to go next I'll just\njump in I mean it's always hard to talk\nabout yourself I don't know what's\ninteresting and what's not you know to\nme it's just me I I think what's\ninteresting is knowing you know where\nyou where you've been and the things\nthat that marked that mapped back to\nyour emotional uh uh networks in a way\nthat for you feel like like that\nmattered in terms of what you're doing\nnow as a little kid I remember\neven as a little kid not liking school I\nwas a very good kid I was a very\nwell-behaved kid I went to a decent\npublic school\num but just the whole idea of it I just\nalways felt like I had two left feet it\nnever felt like it was really me there I\nwas always trying to escape a little bit\nyou know what I mean and thinking about\nwhen I first started educating others\nand like my first memory of educating\nothers like specifically that comes to\nmind is I was six and I went on a little\nvacation in the summer to stay with my\ncousins in Petoskey Michigan which is a\nplace on Lake Michigan where there are\nthese\num Stones where there's my understanding\nfrom when I was six is that there are\nthese like 200 million year old\nfossilized worms in these stones and you\ncan see them when you look at there's\nlike little worms and you can see them\nyeah so I just was fascinated by these\nstones that these are actual fossilized\n200 million year old worms and I don't\nknow if that number is correct that's\nwhat I remember from age six so some\npaleontologists out there can correct me\nbut I looked at these stones and I went\nto the little local exhibit they had at\nthe library or whatever and I learned\nabout these stones and I brought some\nback and somehow somebody thought to ask\nme to teach my second grade class when I\nstarted school about these stones and I\njust remember I don't know how I got\nasked to do this but I remember standing\nin front of my class\nand talking about these stones and just\nlooking around the room and suddenly\nnoticing you know that feeling when\nyou're lecturing and you think oh my God\nthey're fascinated by what I'm saying\nlike every kid is looking at me and like\nholy crap you know like and I was so I'm\nlike all right I'll keep going I'll tell\nyou some more about these stones and I\npassed them around whatever and it must\nhave been okay because I was then asked\nto give that talk all the way up to the\nfifth graders who were way older than me\nand you're a professor I was already\nfascinated by the natural world and able\nto like make meaning out of something in\na way that inspired other people if I\ncan be so blunt doesn't say that and yet\nI was constantly in trouble at school\nfor not having my homework like I was\njust I you know the feeling of release\non the Friday afternoon and the feeling\nof dread on Sunday evening is hard to\nlike describe you know and I went to a\nreasonably well-resourced school you\nknow\num anyway fast forward\nup to when I was older I mean I I was\njust always fascinated by and I think\nsomeone this comes from my mom too\num trying to you know speak different\nlanguages engage with people who are\ndifferent than myself just have\nconversations so from the time I was old\nenough to barely qualify to do these\nprograms my parents had the the\nresources luckily to be able to let me\nto do these things but I you know I went\noff to France and stayed on a farm there\nfor a summer and went to uh you know\nIreland I went to Russia by the time I\nwas 18 I was working with these little\nkids off the street in in camping with\nthem in southern Siberia and all these\nkinds of things when I was as cold as\nthey say inside it was gloomy and rainy\nand muddy and cold yes uh yeah Siberia\nalways sounds so Bleak my parents\nthreatened many times to send me there\noh no yeah no that's a real threat I\nmean it's beautiful in many ways but um\nyeah that was sad it was a sad sad story\num anyway\num you know I think what I I was trying\nto do was actually\nlearn by doing by being by engaging with\nother people who knew things I didn't\nlearning how to you know build things I\nwas always really interested in\nwordworking and boat building I went to\nKenya and spent eight months there as an\nundergraduate right documenting this\ntraditional bowel Construction in a\nnorthern coast of Canada\nwhich are sailboats\num sailboat construction where they have\nno electricity and everything Cabinetry\nyeah Cabinetry you know what I mean you\ncan actually build Furniture so when\npeople say they built furniture but they\nbasically assembled a Kia Furniture\ncabinets and and built-in bookshelves\nand Furniture whatever some of my\nfriends have pieces I made for them I\ndidn't mean anything for myself so I\ndon't have anything\num but um yeah I mean I think I was\nreally torn between trying to build\nthings and Learn by engaging with other\npeople and in these different cultural\nspaces you know being a woman in a\ncabinet in a cabinet shop in Connecticut\nis is really not a cultural space that I\nhad grown up in and then go you know\nwhat I mean and yet Right Moving myself\nand changing myself to adapt to these\ndifferent situations somehow felt like\nlearning to me I think\num and I ended up in a strange situation\nwhere I cut my hand uh opening a window\nat a job site and I needed to I was on\nworkers comp and I had to take um some\ntime to let it heal and I couldn't run\nMachinery so I had to figure out what to\ndo with myself I was 23 years old and I\nwas not going to go back to my parents\nfor more money right so I thought I have\nto support myself so I um I thought okay\nI I went to college at a you know a high\nlevel Ivy League school and I I I\nmajored in French because\nI I could that's basically why I was\nlike I don't know I better finish I\nbetter not flunk I can do French I know\nI know I speak French fluently I'll do a\nFrench literature manager and done with\nit quickly then I'm like what am I going\nto do with myself I never thought I\ncould be a scientist but I loved science\nso I just went around taking like a year\nof every science I took a year of\nastronomy and a year of biology and a\nyear of physics and a year of um you\nknow human anthropology\npaleoanthropology like all these things\npsychology and realized holy crap like\nthis is super interesting you can study\nhow babies think and and the natural\nworld\nand then also uh be be bringing sort of\na scientific lens to bear that helps you\nunderstand things in a new way so so\nhere I was as a 23 year old with a cut\nhand and I thought what am I going to do\nwith myself I convinced the\nMassachusetts Board of Education that I\nyou know uh had the background knowledge\nto be able to uh to to teach some you\nknow sections of AP biology and physics\nthat they had in their high school so\nwhen I got to\num uh you know I finally got an\ninterview with this you know Public\nSchool District in South Boston where\nthey were desperate for a teacher like\nI'm noticing in the Boston Globe or two\nweeks into the school year and you still\ndon't have a teacher you know what I\nmean why don't you take me and uh you\nknow managed to convince the\nMassachusetts Board of Education uh to\ngive me provisional teacher\ncertification based on the coursework\nI'd done and how well I did in that\ncoursework because I did you know I was\nreally super motivated I did extremely\nwell and all that\num and when I got there uh they\nbasically said when I showed up for the\ninterview you know\num another the high school teacher wants\nto take those AP classes can you just\nteach full-time seventh grade so I was\nlike okay so I uh I I you know had my\nfull contingent of 130 kids right\nseventh graders coming through my\nclassroom\nand uh the middle school had just been\nshut down because there wasn't\nsufficient funding in the town for it so\nthey had taken the middle school kids\nand pushed them into the high school\nspace uh what that basically meant is I\nsuddenly found myself in a fully\nequipped high school classroom with\nmicroscopes and all kinds of scientific\nequipment that would be used to teach\nlater courses with my seventh graders\nand it also happened that the\nMassachusetts Board of Education had\nchanged the um the uh the requirements\nfor for the way they organized science\ninstruction and curriculum from you know\nseventh grade life science 8th grade\nphysical science whatever it was you\nknow different Sciences each year they\nwanted an integrated interdisciplinary\nscience all the way across and of course\nthat was very difficult for the\ntraditional science teachers to do\nbecause they've been teaching only\nbiology or only earth science or only\nphysical science\num for their whole career and they\ndidn't know how to teach the other\nsubjects and here comes me with like one\nintensive year of study in each of these\ndomain means I was perfectly situated to\nlike try to pull it together so some of\nthe high school teachers helped me thank\nyou to them\num and I built out a new curriculum for\nseventh grade for that District around\nthis interdisciplinary approach to\nscience\num together with other teachers it was\nvery Hands-On very and it was very much\nlike a web of Concepts you know we'd\nstudy nuclear fission and atoms and\nreactions and then the Sun and astronomy\nand the solar system and then and then\nhow the the energy is being you know\nshined over onto the onto the planets\nand then the Earth and then these\norganisms called plants are actually\nusing those photons to do something\nchemical let's talk about photosynthesis\nand where right and then we can talk\nabout chemical reactions and breaking\ndown sugars and molecules right so we\nbuilt this whole web-like curriculum\nthat I was trying to help the kids\nappreciate the sort of dynamic\ncomplexity of the natural world and some\nof my professors from Cornell also sent\nme uh materials and all kinds of cool\nstuff from the Cornell Museum that that\nthey didn't really need and then I gave\nit back when I was done right with all\nthese instructions what all this stuff\nis on hominid Evolution and Ashley and\nhand axes and all kinds of stuff so I\nbuilt out a curriculum around all this\nstuff and I realized for the first time\nthat I was in this amazingly fascinating\nspace because it just so happened that\nthe school I was working in was one of\nthe most diverse culturally in the\nnation at that time I think we had\nsomething like 81 languages spoken out\nof 1100 kids wow that's a lot of first\nlanguages and kids were arriving from\nall over the world this was right after\nthe Rwandan Genocide so kids were coming\nin from East Africa there were refugees\nfrom uh Kosovo and Eastern Europe there\nwere kids coming in from Jamaica there\nwere kids coming and from Haiti there\nwere kids from Malaysia and uh Myanmar\nlike there were uh there were kids\nLanding in that class like deer and\nheadlights from very very uh broad\nranges of cultural backgrounds and\nthey're Landing in my science class and\nwhat I quickly realized is they were\nusing these scientific ways of exploring\nthe world and thinking about questions\nand and trying to make sense of what\nthey had witnessed\nto try to understand their own sort of\nselves their own origin story their own\nplace in the world why different people\nin this class looked and eat differently\nthan me dressed differently than me like\nhow is it that you look like that and I\nlook like this and there was all this a\ncrazy you know adolescent uh turmoil\nlayered into this space where kids were\ngrabbing on to the scientific ways of\nknowing as a handle to try to make sense\nof who they are and those kids started\nasking questions of me I'll never forget\nthis one girl\na black girl raised her hand and all the\nother kids are looking at her like yeah\nyeah ask it ask it right\num and like you know she was being brave\nlike she talked about it before school\nlike I can't say that no I can't I say\nit say it and she said Miss immortino\nwhy is it that when we're studying\nhominid Evolution and you show us these\nin this Nova episode with early hominids\nin Africa why do they always show those\ncreatures looking like they have dark\nskin why do they always look like black\npeople\nand I was like well because they're on\nthe equator and you need that level of\nmelanin in your skin to be able to adapt\nand live without getting skin cancer in\nthat space right and it opened up this\namazing class discussion that actually\nwent on for months like it evolved into\na whole curriculum that was biology it\nwas culture it was sociality where we\nstarted to really unpack\nthe ways that we as humans are natural\nbeings in the world and the ways in\nwhich our cultural experiences our\nextensions of our natural ways of\nadapting and that had me hooked I\nrealized then that I could bring\nscience right the science of adolescent\ndevelopment and of learning and of\nemotion and of culture\nto this very pressing real world problem\nof how do we help our kids actually\nfigure out who they are invent\nthemselves in this incredi crazy\nMulticultural space and become Scholars\nand intellectuals who engage systematic\nwith the ideas along the way and so I I\ntook those ideas and I started going to\nnight school at Harvard Extension school\nto study cognitive neuroscience and to\nstudy uh language and cognition and you\nknow all these kinds of topics and and\nquickly realized like I really needed\nthis developmental perspective infused\nright I wanted to understand not just\nhow these things works but how they got\nthat way and so I took that back to grad\nschool at Harvard and began to study\num\nuh you know social and cultural and\nemotional and cognitive development in\nkids and and quickly they are also kind\nof hit a wall where I was I went back to\nthe school district in which I worked\nand I went back to the teachers who were\nmy colleagues and I I worked with them\nand I observed their classes and I\ninterviewed their students and we did\nall kinds of work around how kids were\nbuilding scientific Concepts in ways\nthat reflected their cultural Concepts\nand ways of approaching the world and I\nI quickly realized you know it seems to\nme that kids are doing all this meaning\nmaking and we as adults are doing all\nthis uh all this supportive you know\nmeaning making we're also engaging and\ngrowing and learning in ways that\nreflect not just you know knowledge bits\nlike little computers but also that\nreflect the biological substrate on\nwhich the learning and the thinking are\nhappening and I wanted very much to\nunderstand how we could use and leverage\ndevelopmental biology as a kind of a\nconstraint\nto from which to appreciate the kinds of\ntheoretical frames we were inventing in\nthe in the real world sort of\nanthropological educational space the\ndevelopmental psychological space how\ncould these two systems you know act as\na Venn diagram and how could the inner\nsection between them the places where\nthe theorizing about the natural\nbehaviors and the way kids were making\nmeaning and learning and describing\ntheir knowledge and engaging with each\nother on the one hand and the ways in\nwhich the brain and the biology are\nengaging in or supporting those\nprocesses on the other hand the places\nwhere those two circles would overlap it\nseemed to me that was where we could\nmost uh directly Target to start to\ndeeply understand the nature of our\ndevelopmental psychobiological growth\nthemselves and so I set out to try to\nstudy about\num the ways in which culture and\nsociality shape the brain uh and\nPhysiology and and survival mechanisms\nand development and at that time which\nwasn't even that long ago you know it's\nlike two decades ago quickly realized\num very very little was known you know\nabout the way in which emotions Beyond\nthings like fear you know flash a snake\nin your face and your amygdala lights up\nright like I was thinking of something a\nlittle more nuanced you know what I mean\nlike what I'm seeing happening in\nscience class among a kid from Kosovo\nand a kid from Rwanda as they're trying\nto figure out why they understand how\nthey look different right those deeply\nemotional\nconversations they're having but they're\nnot so cut and dry as the things we had\nbeen studying and so that's what really\ndrove me to try to start to understand\nin an integrated way the way in which\nour our biological\ndevelopment and our psychological\ndevelopment are actually sort of two\nsides of who we are and of how we're\norganizing ourselves to build capacity\nmental capacity as well as sort of\nphysical health and capacity over over\nthe course of Our Lives as we're\nengaging with living\nincredible\num story and foray into what sounds to\nme like really\num your ability to\nidentify how the universals Among Us\nlike the universal biological features\nthe universal psychological\nfeatures\ncan really strongly inform\nspecifically what's happening now in a\nclassroom interaction in the mind of an\nof a of you or somebody else or of any\nof us but to approach it from the other\ndirection in other words to take what's\nhappening now and say why is What's\nHappening Now happening yeah as opposed\nto just saying what is actually\nhappening underneath the surface right\nof the behavior right as opposed to\nsaying okay this is uh this is the\npsychology of character structure this\nis the biology of the hypothalamus but\nrather say you know is anyone else\nreally um shocked about the school\nshooting in Nashville and go through the\nthe feeling of shock and and go from\nthere to the biology as a route of\nlearning again and of course I don't\nwant to take away anything from the the\nreal world\num seriousness of that yeah but but it\nsounds to me like you you saw that\nthere's there's a different portal\nthrough which to teach and understand\nexperience and that we are all but\nespecially Young people are really tied\nto our emotional states as the as the\nmain filters which we like that just\nlike that and therefore make decisions\nand move through life I mean I think\nit's so key that early on I mean if we\nlike a teacher oftentimes we like the\nsubject\nif we\num\nhappen to fall in love with you know\nfigure 4B in a paper great but that's\nnot as that's not how I went through\ngraduate school I just was blown away by\nthe fact that sperm meets egg you get a\nbunch of cell duplications and then and\nthen you get a brain and then you get a\nbrain how does that happen I was just\nlike that's crazy amazing and I was\nblessed with a graduate advisor who\nliterally told me this is how it works\nin my lab is what she said uh she said\num\nwe have everything you need here I'll\nhelp you if you need help but basically\nyou're gonna mess around with stuff\nyou're not going to burn down the lab\nyou're not going to kill yourself with\nany of the poisonous stuff\num but then you're gonna like mess some\nstuff up and and do some stuff and\nyou're gonna figure some stuff out this\nis literally the description and and I\nliked her lab because I had green\ncountertops and she had pictures of\ninteresting animals on the wall and then\nshe said and I'm gonna have two kids\nwhile you're in graduate school so I'm\nnot gonna be around very much you're\ngonna have to figure it out on your own\nand I said well can I play the music I\nwant she said sure and I said can I put\ntin foil on the Windows because I don't\nwant to be bothered and she said sure\nand I was like okay this is the place\nfor me in other words she gave me a a\nroom to explore and of course she gave\nme a lot of guidance along the way she\nwas an amazing amazing garage advisor\nextremely blessed but\nit sounds to me like that that\nidentifying what's the what's really\ngoing on now is key and that the other\nthing that's key is in openness to ideas\nI mean earlier you talked about\num kind of the let's just let's just\nadmit where we're at right now we're\ngonna we're in a culture War right now\nwe're in a weird space right now it's\nvery divisive\num and one of the major problems is that\nwe can't really talk about things I mean\nI think\num fear of getting canceled fear of\num exploring ideas is real it's very\nreal not just for academics it's just\nreal people are so it's important to be\nsensitive to the experiences of others\nabsolutely but if we can't actually\nexplore ideas and feel like we can walk\nout of the room safely then we can't\nreally explore ideas and so um I think\nright now it's not just social media I\nthink it's the fear of offending anybody\num and and probably the fear of of\nvoicing how upset certain people are\nabout their experiences or the\nexperiences of others whatever it is I I\ndon't see a landscape right now where\nthere is true open exploration of ideas\nanywhere yeah\nanywhere at least in this country\nso\num what do we do if there if the two if\nat least two of the requirements are\num you know an emotional gripping of of\nsomething around the learning\num plus an openness to thinking about\nthings that maybe we don't feel right to\nus as a way to learn how to think\nsomething I think we both agree if I may\nthat is really critical\num and that the world will be a far\nbetter place if people could do that\num and how do we navigate this landscape\nI mean is what has to come first a\ndemonstration of the value of openness\nof ideas and here I I'll just State my\nstance I I feel like any idea should be\nopen to at least discussion any idea\nbut then it needs to be systematically\ndissected with some rigor so that people\ncan't just assume any idea is true\nyeah because just because it's true for\nthem\num and this I actually learned from my\ngraduate advisor you know she used to\nsay you know tolerance has to go both\nways like when it comes to thinking\nabout ideas and criticizing it can't\njust be I'm right there wrong or I don't\ntolerate that it has to be\ntolerance for all ideas and then you\narrive at hopefully eventually core\ntruths or at least core trajectories I\nmean what do you think\num could support this how early should\nthis start I mean should kids in\nelementary school be discussing\num the current landscape of politics and\nwhat they see from a place of like we\ntalk about safe spaces but is a safe\nspace one in which no one gets offended\nwears a safe space one in which any idea\ncan be discussed I think that's never\nreally been defined for me yeah\noh that's a really fraught issue I mean\nfirst let me go back to something you\nsaid which I would have said it\ndifferently so you said our emotions are\nuh a filter right and they do act like a\nfilter but I actually don't think\nemotions are really filter like\nso much as they are the drives that are\nundergirding the impetus to think right\nthey're pushing us to think about\nparticular things and I think I mean as\na scientist my disposition is always\nthat\nto understand something is good\nand the more\ncomplexly\nthe more thoroughly you can interrogate\nand understand something\nthe better\nso there's nothing\nI'm afraid of knowing\nright and what you're really talking\nabout there is the fear of knowing we\nwhy are people so afraid\nto engage with\neach other basically because\nit's deeply threatening\nto\nreveal things about your own experience\nthat are not going to land in a in us in\na space where we can kind of\ncollectively engage with them as\nlegitimate experience that's the I sort\nof the opposite of canceling people\nright it's the opposite of dismissing\npeople it's actually developing\nspaces of trust where we can engage with\nideas and and and take them from\nourselves right so that we're they don't\nthey're no longer personal value\njudgments they become cultural memes or\nor or or or or\nmodels or schemas that we can we can\ndissect together that we can engage with\ntogether and construct understanding\naround right and and I don't really\nunderstand my own position unless I also\nunderstand\nyour opposition to my position even if I\nstill disagree with you I think there\nare really important conversations going\non right now I'll take it back to the\neducation system because that's that's\nwhat I know it most about there are\nreally important conversations going\naround on right now around reframing\nthe experience and outcomes and aims of\nschooling around Civic discourse and\nreasoning so there's just a major report\nthat was produced by the National\nAcademy of education and uh another\nacademies collaborating with it for\nexample around this topic and helping us\nto move as a society toward a space\nwhere we learn to\num kind of lay ideas out and develop\nskills for reasoning around those ideas\nincluding bringing ethical experiential\nemotional cultural values to Bear but\nthen being willing to deconstruct and\nengage with those ideas whether they're\nthe ones that are commensurate and fluid\nwith our experience or that appear to be\num conflicting or disfluent with our\nexperience we need to develop a a spaces\nfor young people especially but for\neveryone in in to engage with the\ndeconstruction of our own assumptions\nlike I said before and to engage with\nthe with the deconstruction of others\nassumptions and to try to reconcile the\nbuilding blocks and that's where we can\nbuild some common ground but we can also\ndisagree we but we don't really\nunderstand our own position unless we\nappreciate someone else's disagreement\nwith our position unless we can actually\narticulate and appreciate appreciate how\nit is that person's opinion is opposed\nto mine I don't really understand mine\nit's such a key point one of the reasons\nwhy I do read all the comments uh on\npodcasts on YouTube it takes me some\ntime but I do it or on social media is\nthat\num oftentimes I'll get a comment or a\ncriticism that makes it very clear that\nI wasn't clear about something other\ntimes I'll get a commentary criticism\nthat makes it clear that my and the\nother person fundamentally disagree\nabout something both of which are great\nand for a scientist is a delight so keep\nit coming\num and of course when people agree and\num they agree and make it clear that\nthey agree from a stance of\nunderstanding that of course is also\ngratifying\num so it's exactly what you're saying\nand it's one of one of the upsides I\nthink of social media which is that\nunless people block their comment\nsection\nand I do occasionally block people if\nthey're being offensive to other people\nyeah yeah\nalienating people that's not inviting\npeople into a conversation that's not\nconstructive I actually have a rule um\nwhich is I call it classroom rules I've\nnever announced it but I I allow for\nclassroom rules you can swear but you\ncan't swear at people yeah that's what I\nwas taught in graduate school\nit's where weekends we're at people it's\nalso also our rule at home although we\ntry not to swear it so you can swear but\nswearing at people is not not okay yeah\num and that you know a certain\ndecorum of you know is required in order\nto have open discourse\num so that works for me I think that um\nit's been a while since I've been in\nschool but I work at a school and I\nthink that the the ability to\num not just reinforce but challenge\none's own stances which sometimes leads\nto reinforcing our own stances it may if\nthere will man that's legitimate I mean\nI have to assume that in high schools\nthey still do debates and things of that\nsort I mean uh do they allow that I mean\nCould you um throw kids in a class and\nsay let's debate um something really\ncontroversial and then but you have to\ndebate it from the other side I mean\njust as a experiment of forcing the\nbrain to\num try to be effective uh for sake of\nwinning but from the other perspective\num uh or stance it seems like a great\nexercise if I if I were a high school\nteacher that's the first thing I do we\npick the most controversial topic and\nthen I picked I'd ask people to divide\nalong that topic and then I'd swap them\ninto the other one and have them argue\nfrom the other one stance yeah learning\nto appreciate perspectives is very is\nvery and we'd use 14 ounce clothes no\nI'm kidding it wouldn't be physical it\nwould be purely intellectual yeah yeah I\nmean let's take can we take it back to\nthe brain for a moment to the\nconversation that we were having earlier\nright so we were talking about\nthat in our experiments and now in whole\nyou know whole bodies of neuroscientific\nknowledge\nwe know that there is this very\ninteresting neurobiological sort of\nprocessing difference between\nemotions and the thoughts that are part\nof those emotions that are you know the\nresult of those emotions that are also\nincipitating those emotions right like\nthat whole process when it pertains to\nuh the direct actions observable\ncharacteristics behaviors you know uh of\nanother person or situation that you can\nactually directly pretty much directly\nand learn or infer\nas compared to when you have to bring a\nwhole lot of conceptual content\nknowledge to Bear experiential knowledge\nuh simulation capacity to Bear to be\nable to fully appreciate the nature of a\nsituation and we talked about how that\nsecond kind of processing that I called\nTranscendent is is in essence about\num distancing yourself from the\nimmediate physical\nyou know situation the observable\nperceivable situation in a direct sense\nand instead constructing a narrative in\nyour mind that's built from that but\nthat then brings to Bear all these other\nkinds of of\num information that allow you to\nelaborate this into a narrative that\ntakes on emotional meaning and and\npsychological power as a narrative it\nbecomes part of identity beliefs all\nthat kind of stuff and we talked about\nthat kind of thinking being associated\nwith the so-called default mode which is\ndeactivated systematically\nand decoupled from itself right the\ndifferent regions aren't talking to each\nother to each other when you are in the\nworld acting doing a task paying\nattention inferring the direct things\nthat you need to notice around you you\nknow you're in the middle of playing a\nsoccer game the ball's coming at your\nhead that's not a time to stop and Muse\nabout you know Title IX and girls access\nto sports right you're gonna you're\ngonna trip and fall or you're gonna miss\nyour shot at the goal or are you going\nto hit get hit with the ball right so we\nneed to sort of manage that space in\norder to have these conversations and I\nI think what's important here is to\nremember that the default mode Network\nthat is the substrate that's that is\nplaying out your own sense of self and\ninner Consciousness and self-awareness\nand is also the basis on which we\nconstruct these broader inferential\nnarratives that are the elaborative\nstuff of stories and beliefs\nare fundamentally incompatible the\nactivation of those systems is\nfundamentally incompatible with uh\nneeding to be vigilant into the\nimmediate physical or social situation\naround you so if you feel physically\nemotionally culturally socially unsafe\nand you feel that you're you need to\nwatch your back either literally or\nmetaphorically as you're thinking about\nthings\nneurobiologically that situation is in\nconducive it is not conducive to being\nable to actually conjure an alternative\nperspective in which you construct a\nmeaningful narrative with alternate\nethical implications with alternate\nprospective possible future outcomes\nwith alternate views of the historical\nprecedent or context being able to sort\nof mentally time travel into the space\nof those ideas\nis only really possible when people feel\nsafe to think together so is it it\nsounds like it's anti-creative yes\ncreativity is also associated with the\nactivations of these networks yeah\ncausally so in some recent work I had\nthe Good Fortune of having dinner last\nyear with um somebody I won't reveal who\nit is but he he runs a major so uh\nsocial media platform\nand he told me that in Japan\nit's common for people to have\ntwo or three or even as many as seven\ndifferent social media handles yeah\num and that they do this in order to\nembody different versions of themselves\nsafely yeah so these are not troll\naccounts these are not the accounts and\nby the way I see you troll accounts that\nsay whatever and then you go to their\naccounts as some private account where\nthey hide rather these are\nindividuals who have multiple accounts\num in one account they might be a bit\naggressive maybe even a bully online\ndare I say in another account they might\nbe very fawning and um show up as the\nperson that everyone knows them to be in\nthe real world in another account they\nmight be a university professor and\nanother they're an athlete and it's\nfabricated in the sense that the the\nposts that they put up often don't\naccurately represent who they are in the\nreal world yeah but it's accurate in the\nsense that it represents the different\ndimensions of their Persona that are\ndriving their real world decision making\nat some level it's kind of like pretend\nplay for little kids it's pretend play\nbut it's it's not pretend because it's\nin cyberspace\num I'll just go back to Rick Rubin who\num in addition to being this incredible\nmusic producers is a enormous fan of\nprofessional wrestling for many years\nand I've asked him you know from a\nperplexians like why professional\nwrestling is it the athleticism he says\nit's the only thing that's real because\neveryone agrees it's not real and so\nthese are characters right so you're\nyou're agreeing for it to not be real\nand yet it allows these characters to\nfully embody these different personas\nand and I had the experience um years\nago I was at Cold Spring Harbor\nlaboratory summer camp for scientists\nwhere I attended and taught and I was in\na cab driving out to Cold Spring Harbor\nfrom the train station so I lost it and\nI got into a discussion with the cab\ndriver and he said Okay you're from\nCalifornia he said a New York accent I\nwon't try and imitate you said you're\nfrom California and he said you know\nyour governor who at the time was\nSchwarzenegger he said he's great and I\nand I said tell me more I I happened to\nlike Schwarzenegger for a number of\nreasons he actually signed my PhD\nbecause he was\n[Music]\nyes and and he said well because if\nterrorists show up in California he's\ngonna\ngo out there with a machine gun and take\nthem down so in his adult life the\nTerminator he's the Terminator he's the\nTerminator and I realized in that moment\nthis was a was a smart guy this cab\ndriver a smart guy that that it wasn't a\nlack of narrative distancing no he had\nconflated the actor with the roles he\nplayed yeah and I realized in that\nmoment that this was not a reflection of\nhim being\nunintelligent it was a reflection of the\nfact that the brain often collapses\nidentities absolutely of others and\nmakes these I think it's just an\nofficial sufficient it's an efficient\nway to to parse the world yeah we decide\nand then that's that kind of this person\nand we put them over there on a shelf\nright yeah so so to return to the\ndiscussion that that we're having I I\nthink that the ability to embody\ndifferent aspects of self but also the\nability to transiently embody the\npersonas of other people and to do that\nin a way that allows for really thorough\nexploration of idea space yeah I feel\nlike can only be a good thing yeah\nprovided it doesn't get physically\nviolent or something\num but that to me seems like the exact\nopposite of what's happening now which\nis that\num people are siloing off into their\ncamps where specific language and\nspecific ideas are accepted and others\nare not I mean it's it's it's\nso interesting and perplexing and\ndisturbing to me that the way that\ncertain things that have nothing to do\nwith politics get lumped with one group\nor the other you know that um it's so\ncrazy to me on the one hand and um and\nyet I I think what you're describing\nseems to me the route out of all of this\nI really mean that I feel like you the\nthe education system starting Young And\ngetting people emotionally engaged\nlearning what they like what they don't\nlike but then also teaching them about\ntheir emotional systems and how it helps\nthem parse the world is really the\nsolution so that when we're upset we can\nrealize like yeah I'm upset it makes\nsense why I'm upset but let me explore\nit from the other side it also makes\nsense why they're upset and that seems\nto be what humans have done somewhat\nthroughout history never perfectly well\nbut it seems like it ought to be\npossible I mean the forebrain is there\nfor a reason\nso could you\num in\nin wanting to go back to a little bit of\nthe biology and the research what have\nyou seen in terms of cross-cultural\nconsistency yeah about the role of\nemotions in it in our ability to parse\nand learn and\num\nbecause obviously we're not going to\nsolve these problems today but although\nI think you've shine light on some some\npotential Solutions I mean what do we\nknow for sure about human beings and\ntheir capacity to do what you're\ndescribing to to Really\num learn differently uh it worked in the\nclassroom where you were teaching but\nhow could each and every one of us do\nthis I mean how would we approach this I\nguess I want to take this to the\nPractical\num what can we do when we read a\nnewspaper article what can we do when we\nwe're on social media what can we do uh\nwhen our kid is like refusing to do\nsomething\num because they simply don't like it or\nthat the teacher they don't like the\nteacher are are there paths through that\nthat you've identified or that you can\nsense work\nI can get funny examples of my own kids\nwhen they didn't like things at school\nright this isn't licensed yeah what\ntools do you use licensed to not well\nyeah so so my my son when he was in\nthird grade he was he was very upset\nabout\nthe behavior chart that his teacher had\nat school right so he had a he had a\nbehavior chart they had a behavior\nCharter back the room that the principal\ndidn't agree with this but that teacher\nwas there for a year and okay so there's\nthis behavior chart and you have green\nyou start on green with your little clip\nand then there's yellow and then there's\nred which is like call your parents\nwhich I I never understood why they\ndon't put call your parents on the green\nbut anyway right so you know you start\non the green and then you get you get\ndown to the yellow and they get around\nto red and you know there's Ted's little\nfriend is always getting on the red by 9\nA.M it's like can we just get it over\nwith you know and and he tried to talk\nwith his teacher about why this behavior\nchart made him so uncomfortable because\nand she couldn't she could not\nunderstand his perspective because she\nkept saying but you're always on green\nyou're always doing what you're supposed\nto be doing and you're respectful and\nyou're well behaved so why is it a\nproblem and what he was trying to say\nwas that\nsomehow it just made him uncomfortable\nto have that there so he was constantly\nbothering me with this I finally told\nhim I was trying to work one day and he\nwas home from school because I would let\nhim work from home some days because we\nneeded to to kind of buffer a little bit\nand uh you know he'd bring all his work\nhome and he'd do it himself I'd be\nworking he'd be working right it's fine\nhe had all kinds of projects going on\nyou know\nand this is a kid who does a little Side\nStory there's a kid who went to first\ngrade and about two weeks into first\ngrade good first grade class he he was\ncrying on a Sunday night to me like I\ncan't go to school I don't want to go to\nschool I'm like well what's you know\nwhat's wrong I'm thinking he's getting\nbullets and he's talking he's like I\ndon't know he finally looks at me and he\ngoes I have so much work to do how do\nyou expect me to get my work done if I'm\nsitting in school all day\nI can relate right I can relate can you\nrelate because you're actually a\nmotivated right we take kids motivations\nand the things they're interested in and\nwe sideline them and try to structure\nthem into something so back there are\nLegos yeah oh he was he was way into\nbuilding armor at that time he would\nyeah I know we're probably terrible\nparents but we gave him some safety\nglasses and we taught him how to use it\nand we explained how Metals sharp and we\ngave him some shoes that is super cool\nand some tin snips and he made a whole\nset of armor in the backyard at you know\nin second grade anyway it took him\nmonths and months I mean it chained mail\nthe whole bit he was super into amazing\nyou know anyway and he made airplane he\ndid all kinds of things\num but so here's this kid and he's\nbugging me about his teacher in this\npaper Trend I said Ted go write a letter\nto your teacher if it bothers you that\nmuch you go write a letter about why it\nbothers you right because in doing so\nhe's first of all helping to solve the\nproblem secondly he was he was\nformulating his understanding of what\nthis behavior chart is and why\nspecifically it bothers him and in so\ndoing it helps him not be so bothered by\nit right so that's an example of\nsomething you could do right so he wrote\nthis letter to his teacher which ended\nup being published in the National\nAcademy of Science engineering and\nMatt's book how people learn volume two\nbecause I was on the committee of people\nthat wrote it and we needed an example\nof kids making sense out of motivational\nthings and actually took his name and\nthe teacher's name off and put the\nletter in the book it basically is a\nlittle kid saying listen teacher when\nyou put up this behavior chart he called\nit a bad behavior chart which it wasn't\nit was just a behavior chart but he\ninterprets it as bad behavior when you\nput that up it's as if your you're\ndaring me to do something bad you're\nyou're basically he doesn't say it like\nthis he says you're basically making me\nuncomfortable because you are laying out\na perspective on me a possibility space\nfor me that you're now bringing into the\nconversation that I could be like that\nand let's see if you're going to be oh\nnot today oh we're still on green right\nand so where does this go it goes back\nto the idea that kids are and all of us\nare\ninterpreting the interactions and the\nstructures around us not only for what\nthey are but for what they represent as\nsomebody else's\ninterpretation of what we are or are not\ncapable of and\nhe saw that behavior chart as a marker\nthat his teacher assumed that all kids\nin that class are capable of being badly\nbehaved and that their main aim of being\nin school is to be well behaved right\nand so he writes all about saying saying\ndear teacher every day I come to school\nevery single day and every single day is\nnew that's what he says and I could\nlearn something new\nexcept then I see dot dot dot the bad\nbehavior chart right he's saying school\nis supposed to be about learning and and\nUS engaging and you're making it about\nsomething so low level and basic as are\nyou going to behave yourself today we're\nwe are insulting him by the way we frame\nthe context so take it back to the\nbigger issues of Civic discourse and all\nthese things I think so much of the way\nthat we're organizing our lives our\nsocial relationships our community our\nCivic structures right now\nis mirroring that teacher's behavior\nchart right she take the chart down I\ndon't no I don't think so and and what\nand I asked because I'm not sure that it\nmatters I think what probably matters is\nthat he had the chance to voice he\nvoices his understanding yeah his\nunderstanding of the chart yeah that's\nright and now you know anybody can read\nhis understanding of the story because\nin like uh you know the most you widely\nread textbook on learning right\num and motivation\nI mean\nfirst is that we're structuring the way\nwe structure our environment can\nunwittingly\nimpose\nour mental models of other people's\npossibility spaces onto them and people\nfind that inherently abhorrent right so\nthink about how we're doing that in many\ncontexts not simply in schools\num and then the second thing is from the\nkids perspective\ndeconstructing exactly why and something\nbothers you by understanding how it is\nthat you are interpreting that thing\nthen opens you up\nto be able to manage those spaces in a\nnew way and to engage in them in a new\nway so if we take the conversation back\nto the idea of Civic discourse of Civic\nreasoning of engaging with with any idea\nright there are ideas that are deeply\nproblematic there are ideas that are\ndeeply hurtful that have long histories\nof trauma associated with them of long\nhistories of power dynamics uh and\noppression associated with them the way\nin which I think we deconstruct those\nideas is going to be critical to how\nthose ideas live on implicitly in our\nsocial relationships and our society if\nwe cancel them if we negate them and\npretend they don't exist all we're doing\nis burying them in a place where they\ncan't be deconstructed and only by\nactually taking them apart and\nappreciating the pain the the\nrelationship structures the limitation\nthe resource allocations the inequities\nthat are implicit in those Concepts only\nby deconstructing and deeply\nunderstanding those\ncan we rebuild them in a different way\nso it's very difficult because on the\none hand\nwe have a space created for ourselves\nright now in society that is deeply\nunsafe for many people and when you're\nin an unsafe space you are not in a\nspace that is conducive to constructing\nand deconstructing meaning using those\ndefault mode systems and other systems\njust to be crass about the brain right\nand kind of oversimplify it that are the\nsubstrate of autobiographical self of\npossibility spaces of ethics of deep uh\nmoral and ethical emotions so on the one\nhand we have a space that is deeply\nunsafe for individuals to think together\nand genuinely so there are real\nimplications for people to reveal\ncertain kinds of identities to engage\nwith certain kinds of ideas in\nculturally uh culturally\num\nformulated spaces right that we've\nconstructed together\nand the irony is that we can only fix\nthat and create a different way of\ninteracting with one another by actually\nboldly going in there together so it's a\nvery nuanced line where we need to\ndevelop skills and this is where I think\nand many people think now that schools\nshould be focused across disciplinary\ndomains whether it's Math Science Social\nStudies history art the Arts right\nSports should be focused on helping\nyoung people and teachers\ndevelop capacities and dispositions for\ndeconstructing and constructing again\nsafe uh safe cultural spaces to think\ntogether about\nyou know interpretations about\nnarratives about stories about\nassumptions about ideas because as we\nengage in those thoughts together we\ncall that Civic discourse right we learn\nkind of rules for not triggering and\nsensibilities for not endangering\nanother person's ability to engage on\nequal footing with us because if we\ntrigger those unsafe right dangerous\nplaces for people they can't\nneurobiologically then engage with us\ndeeply around sharing their perspective\nand deconstructing hours together to\nbuild something where we have a shared\nunderstanding in the middle we have to\ntrust one another and Trust trusting one\nanother really means we have to have a\nspace established in which we can\nfeel\nsafe to deconstruct our own beliefs and\nto allow others to do the same and to\nassure them that we can engage with\nthose beliefs no matter what they are\nand then\nactually\nexteriorize them and evaluate them\ntogether and think about them around\ncore values we probably both hold like\nwell-being like sustainability of\nsociety and of cultures and of groups\nright these things are core everyone\nwants to be well everyone wants to have\na sustainable life and a Life future and\na cultural set of values and so when we\nall appreciate that we're bringing those\nthings to the table but then are\nsystematic about constructing a space\nfor civic discourse in which we are\nsupporting one another and\ndeconstructing our own beliefs rather\nthan each other's bullies right then we\nare at a space where we can start to\nconstruct some kind of understanding\nsome kind of nuanced more\num uh adaptive more pro-social and the\ntrue sense way of engaging with one\nanother with not necessarily a way of\nagreeing with one another but way of\nengaging and constructing and\ndeconstructing meaning together so that\nwe can be adaptive so that we can build\na society where everyone can flourish so\nthat we can build a society where\neveryone can belong and can uh can\nactually have the resources they need I\nwould argue as long as free speech is\nnot possible for everybody yeah that\nnobody yes that's right then nobody is\nsafe nobody's safe and that there's an\nillusion of safety around the idea that\num people who\num who have voice uh are going to get\nwhat they want simply because they are\nthe ones who are allowed to talk and\nother people aren't yeah I mean I think\nhe said it perfectly when he said that\nanytime ideas get buried there's no way\nthey can be solved yeah we know this\nfrom the scientific literature for\ninstance the results within social\nscience and biological science that are\ndeeply troubling yeah um you know I can\nthink of experiments that were done uh\nin the realm of neurosurgery on humans\nin the 1960s people stimulating\ndifferent brain areas and seeing Rage or\nseeing very politically controversial\nideas emerge from the person's mouth in\nreal time as a function of stimulating\nthat brain area and then you say well\ndid they really believe that and they\njust never were saying it and the person\ndoesn't even recall that happening\nduring the surgery or I mean this idea\nthat Jung had that we have all things\ninside of us yeah I think can be seen as\na very dangerous notion and territory\nthat we have all these Shadows but the\nthe I'm also an optimist and I feel that\nthe the optimistic view of it is that by\nknowing that we have all things inside\nof us potentially and by\nembracing that fact that we can manage\nthat to steal what you just said we can\nmanage that and that we can function so\nmuch better when we see something in the\nworld that we think that's not me I'm\nnot that and I hate that when if we\nunderstand that that also lives inside\nof us but that we just don't realize it\nuh and I realize some people hear this\nand they'll go that's not true you know\nI have my stances and I disagree with\nother things I would say absolutely yes\nbut the difference between\none person's stance and another person's\nstance is could be purely developmental\nwiring it could be\num it could be a difference of having\nread different childhood books and\noriented towards one book versus another\nI mean I don't I think that we are very\nsimilar at the level of core wiring and\ncore algorithms that we run but somehow\nthese days we have the perception that\nwe've diverged so much I think the only\nthing that's really missing is what\nyou're describing is is a place where\nany and all ideas can be explored freely\nnot to establish consensus or validity\nof certain kinds of ideas but to\nactually exteriorize them and and\ndeconstruct them for what they actually\nare absolutely\num thank you for working through that\nthat space because it's a tricky one\nit's very it's very fresh yeah it's very\nfraught\num but so so very important I have a\nquestion that's very basic yeah\num but I've never gotten a good answer\non um I was raised thinking that mirror\nneurons were a real thing that there are\nthese neurons that exist in the in the\nbrains of Us and other Old World\nprimates\num like macaque monkeys\num but especially in humans the the\nso-called mirror neurons that are\nactivated when we see somebody\nexperience something and it evokes a\nsort of empathic understanding\num in US I've also seen some reviews\nwritten recently in some popular press\nsaying that mirror neurons are perhaps\nnot playing the the critical role that\nwe thought they were\num what's the story on mirror neurons\num and uh we're not going after\nanybody's work in particular I just want\nto know whether or not there's real\nvalidity to this notion of mirror\nneurons\nI'm not an expert on it but I can tell\nyou what I know about it and the way\nthat um I think about it so I mean I\nthink it's pretty clear now that there\nare no such things as mirror neurons\nlike some special kind of cell type\nthat's in the brain that they've not\nbeen found they were predicted but they\nwere not found\num but something else was also predicted\nback in the late 1980s\num uh by Antonio DiMaggio\num where he talked about the brain\num in terms of being organized in terms\nof what he called convergent and\nDivergent zones so he talked about\num the brain being organized as networks\nconverging and then diverging again back\nout so you have places where processing\nis kind of coming together and then then\nwhat happens in there then determines\nhow things get spread back out and\nyou've got these sort of Loops happening\nin the brain and and his his thinking on\nthat was very much\num commensurate with others thinking\nabout the notion of uh of goal directed\naction and perception so if you think\nback to developmental Scholars who had\nknew nothing about the brain very much\nlike Jean Piaget right back in the early\nuh 20 20th century\num where he was observing young children\nand noticing that they were interacting\nwith the world\nand they expected certain things and\nthey were he thought imposing theories\nor schemas onto the world and then and\nthen accommodating was the word he used\nuh the world with their actions what it\ndidn't act the way they expected and\nthen assimilating that back right to\nchange what they expected next time so\nthat he had this model that he built\nfrom from systematically observing\nchildren uh three in particular right\num where he what he realized is that\nkids are not just flailing around sort\nof discovering things haphazardly\nthey're imposing a certain logic onto\nthe world and then they're\nsystematically testing that logic so\ntheir hypothesis basically yes right\nthey they're expecting things and then\nwhen the world does what they want that\nreinforces and when it does something\ndifferent that's surprising and then\nthey have to accommodate and make sense\nand then they have to expect differently\nin the future\nso what does this have to do with mirror\nand irons I think when you bring these\ndifferent ideas together that the\npsychological observational ideas and\nthen the neurobiological ideas\num what we basically have and I I wrote\nabout this a little bit in like I think\n2008 I have a paper called something\nlike the smoke around mirror neurons and\nI forget the second half of the title\nbut it has the word goals and and uh and\ndirected actions and things right\num the idea I think is is it's not that\nthere are special neurons that are\nfiring when we see another person do the\nthing right that but that we are it goes\nback to the notion of us imposing our\nexpectations onto the world you have to\nshare and understand intuitively the\ngoal of the other one's action in order\nto activate these mirror regions right\num uh where and what are those mural\nregions they are basically regions that\nare deeply interconnected with each\nother right they're thoroughly\ninterconnected with each other in terms\nof white matter fiber tracts and they\nare regions involved in\num Acts\nuh planning you know goal-oriented\nactions and\nperceiving the outcomes of those actions\nso it's a kind of a loop between acting\nand perceiving and acting and perceiving\nand and I argued at the time right that\ngoals are emergent like high-level goals\nare emergent from the dynamic feedback\nloops of acting and perceiving right so\nI was really taking a very piagetian\nview but imposing that on the\nNeuroscience so I think you take what\nI'm saying together with like a\npiagetian constructivist view there are\nmany other constructivist\nneuroscientists all a constructive\npsychologists also and and then also the\nneural data what we see is that we don't\nhave these special neurons built into\nour head what we have is a natural\nproclivity and I don't know where that\ncomes from right but we have a natural\nproclivity to try to appreciate another\nperson's actions feelings\nexperiences\nby leveraging our own similar actions\nfeelings experience variances and so\nwhen we can share goals or experiences\nthat becomes more facile right and\nthat's been shown over and over in these\nmirror type papers right and when you uh\ndistance yourself from those goals and\nactions or don't have an intuitive sense\nof them then you don't get these\nmirroring activations you don't get\nthese kind of ramped up\num uh sharing of of of of of goals right\nor of of experience so I think it really\ncomes back to\nthe way the nervous system is wired to\nbe inherently social we are cultural\nLearners we are situated in Social\nspaces from the moment we're conceived\nand certainly from the moment we're born\nand that social space observing others\ninteracting with others co-regulating\neach other's physiology each other's\nattention each other's um emotion right\nas we do those things we accommodate to\neach other and we wire ourselves to\nexpect certain kinds of feelings and\nthen to recognize those same things in\nother people and so as we share\nconstructed experience together we start\nto appreciate the sameness right the the\nparallels between other peoples and our\nown emotions thoughts goals and\nand we can also uh dehumanize them you\nknow make the other the other person not\nshare our thoughts emotions goals and\nthen we are capable of all kinds of\nhorrible things we've talked about\nbefore right\num where you're where you've actually\ndistanced yourself\nso what's the scope on mirror neurons I\ndon't think mirror neurons exist I think\nthat's the consensus but our propensity\nto engage with other people by\nsimulating on the substrate of our own\nself and then inferring the goals and\nthe feelings and the outcomes and the\nexperiences of those experiences that\nwe've simulated that's what is very\nessential to being a human but keeping\nin mind that there's also this layer of\nlearned lived cultural developed\nexpectations we impose onto the world\nand we not filter but we\num we steer our attention we steer our\nperception to accommodate to align with\nour expectations so it's never just the\nreality of what the person experienced\nor what happened it's always our\nperception of that reality as we\nexpected it to happen so there's this\nvery Dynamic cultural co-construction\nhappening that is um that is messy that\nis iterative that you can learn learn to\ndo in different ways in different\ncontexts and and that's kind of how I\nunderstand this notion of mirroring\nbefore we conclude I do want to answer\nyour son's question oh so so prior to\nrecording\num there was a text message that came we\ndon't have to read it verbatim but the\ntext message um\nuh Mary Ellen's son uh is uh late\nteenage years and he's been doing uh\ndeliberate cold exposure cold showers on\non a daily basis and reported that he's\nnot get it he hasn't had any colds since\nstarting this this is actually a pretty\ncommon experience because the pulse and\nadrenaline that is inevitable with a\nuncomfortably cold but safe\nin the morning does a whole bunch of\nexercises to get warm and then jumps in\na freezing cold shower amazing um that\nSpike of adrenaline we know is\nneuroprotective if it's a short-lived\nspike in Adrenaline you know what\nchronically no you don't want chronic\nstress that's not good that's not good\nwe know that from the beautiful worker\nBruce McEwen and Bob sapolsky and others\nyeah so\num but then he asked\num should he get sick\nshould he continue the cold showers and\nand the answer is no I think that um\nthen it would be hot showers and hot\nbaths and sauna type stuff is probably\nbetter but not so hot that it's\nstressful yeah you really want to reduce\nstress on a on an ill system yeah so um\nhe sounds uh for many reasons like a\nremarkable young man as as is your\ndaughter it sounds like a remarkable and\nlisten and you're remarkable and I I\nreally mean that I feel like we could go\non forever exploring these ideas I I\nabsolutely uh would love to have you\nback for another discussion or or many\num about your research\nI want to thank you for taking the time\nof your research schedule your teaching\nschedule to come educate us today these\nideas are so vitally important and and\nyou provide so many real world examples\nin fact it's one of the things that I\nlove so much about your work is that\nit's really nested in real world\napplications thank you and your thoughts\nand perspectives on the education and\nhow it could be better at the level of\neducating kids at home teaching\nourselves teachers and the education\nsystem I I hope will ring far and wide\num because they they really can be\nimplemented we're not talking about the\nneed to purchase a bunch of stuff no we\nneed to start with a different\ndisposition we need to start with a\ndifferent goal yeah the goal of\nEducation needs to not learning is not\nthe goal it's not the outcome it needs\nto be the development of the person\nright how is a person changing\nthemselves\nHaving learned this and then you design\nthe learning opportunities to change who\npeople are capable of becoming right so\nthe learning is there but it's not the\nend point it's just the means to\nsomething else which we haven't been\nattending to enough and that's the\ndevelopment of the person who they\nbecome Having learned that\nbeautifully but\num well thank you so much for your time\nthank you so much for the work you do\nand I can't wait to have another\ndiscussion with you about the emerging\nresearch great I'll be back thank you\nthank you for joining me today for my\ndiscussion about emotions social\ninteractions and learning with Dr Mary\nHelen immordino Yang I hope you
