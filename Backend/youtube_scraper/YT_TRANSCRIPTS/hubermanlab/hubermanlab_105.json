    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday my guest is Dr Susanna soberg Dr\nSusanna soberg completed her doctoral\nthesis work at the center of\ninflammation and metabolism and the\ncenter for physical activity research at\nthe University of Copenhagen in Denmark\nher research has focused on how\ndeliberate cold exposure and deliberate\nheat exposure can be used to enhance\nhuman metabolism she is the first author\nof a seminal study which discovered the\nminimum thresholds for deliberate heat\nand deliberate cold exposure for\nincreasing Brown fat thermogenesis which\nis essentially a mode of increasing heat\nproduction and Metabolism in the body\nand for establishing actionable\nprotocols that can be used outside of\nthe laboratory to improve metabolism and\nhuman health Dr sober's research was\npublished in the journal cell reports\nmetabolism in 2021 adding to a long and\nimportant history of research focusing\non the role of cold and the role of heat\nin altering various aspects of the\nbody's physiology including Hormone\nHealth metabolism and changes in\nneurotransmitters such as dopamine and\nepinephrine in fact today's discussion\nwith Dr soberg focuses on the role of\ndeliberate heat and deliberate cold\nexposure on metabolism but it also\nincludes discussion of the effects of\ncold and heat on things like\nneurotransmitter production namely\ndopamine and epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine the so-called\ncatecholamines which strongly impact\nmood and Metabolism in addition Dr\nsoberg answers many common questions\nabout deliberate cold and deliberate\nheat exposure including for instance the\ndifference between cold showers versus\ncold immersion up to the neck versus\ntotal body cold immersion including\nwhether or not going back and forth\nbetween heat and cold changes\nfundamentally the way that heat and cold\nimpact the metabolism hormones and\nneurotransmitter production and we talk\nabout almost every single nuance and\nvariation on deliberate cold and\ndeliberate heat exposure protocols as it\nrelates to the underlying science in\nparticular how cold receptors at the\nlevel of the skin are impacted versus\ncold reception and perception at the\nlevel of the brain and how all of that\nimpacts systems of the brain and body\nrelating to mental health physical\nhealth and Performance Based on her\nscientific research and academic\ntraining as well as her understanding\nand use of deliberate heat and\ndeliberate cold exposure protocols Dr\nsoberg is considered one of the world's\nleading experts on these topics in fact\nshe is the author of a recent book\nentitled winter swimming which is I have\nto say a terrific book because it breaks\ndown chapter by chapter the different\naspects of deliberate heat and\ndeliberate cold into its various\nconstituent Parts including cold\nacclimation the cold shock response\ndangers and safeties of cold water\nthe impact of cold and impact of heat on\nvarious aspects of human health as well\nas specifics relating to sauna versus\nIce versus cold swimming showers Etc\nit's a very thorough read and a very\neasy and accessible read that if you are\ninterested in deliberate cold or\ndeliberate heat exposure or both will\nallow you to embrace those protocols\nwith the greatest degree of confidence\nthat you're going to obtain the specific\nendpoints that you're interested in and\nto do so safely before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nand consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Plunge\nplunge makes what I believe is the most\nversatile at-home self-cooling cold\nplunge for deliberate cold exposure\ntalk numerous times on this podcast\nabout the many benefits of deliberate\ncold exposure and indeed today's episode\nis focused entirely on the benefits and\nthe science of deliberate cold exposure\nplunge uses a powerful cooling\nfiltration and sanitation unit to give\nyou access to deliberate cold exposure\nin clean water whenever you want as\nwe'll discuss during today's episode\nwith Dr Susanna soberg deliberate cold\nexposure especially deliberate cold\nexposure done up to the neck in water\ncan be used to achieve a number of\nimportant endpoints related to mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nI've been using a plunge for more than\ntwo years now I can tell you that it\nmakes it very easy to get your\ndeliberate cold exposure at home it\ndoesn't require much cleaning in fact\nit's very easy to keep clean which is\nessential you don't want bacteria and\nother things growing in your cold plunge\nbasically everything about the plunge is\nmade easy so that anyone including\nmyself can gather deliberate cold\nexposure on a

soberg\nwelcome\nthank you so great to have you here I\nfeel like I should give a little bit of\nthe back story of how we got connected\nwhich was that for many years I've been\ninterested in cold thermogenesis it was\nthe topic of my seniors thesis in\ncollege and I've of course followed the\npopularity of Wim Hof and we've had Dr\nCraig Heller my colleague from biology\ndepartment at Stanford who works on cold\nand its impact on physiology and sports\nperformance so for a long time I've been\ninterested in this area\nbut there's been a real uh lack of new\nlet's say high profile quality\nscientific information in terms of how\nfor instance cold plunges and sauna how\nthat impacts human physiology I know\nthere's been some information out there\nbut it's been sort of scattered and then\na little over a year ago I see this\npaper in cell reports medicine and was\nimmediately struck the first of all the\nfact that it was in cell reports\nmedicine I've been on the cell press\neditorial board for a long time now so\npress journals are of course phenomenal\njournals and the title and the content\nof the paper was directly in line with\nthe sorts of practices that people are\nvery curious about and then are starting\nto emerge things like sauna cold plunges\nand there was your name first\non the author list and I reached out to\nyou through social media and we've done\na little bit of live content there\ntogether and I've been tracking what\nyou've been doing in the world in terms\nof your book and talking about the\nresults in your manuscript and talking\nabout the science and impact of\ndeliberate cold exposure and sauna and I\nhave to say that it's been a wonderful\nand remarkable thing to see and you're\nbringing so much quality information\nabout this area that for a long time I\nthink was kind of Niche and is now\nbecoming more and more mainstream so I'm\ngoing to start off with a thank you for\nbeing here and a thank you for the work\nthat you've done and I'm looking forward\nto talking to you about it today so my\nfirst question to get things started is\nwhat is happening when we get into an\nuncomfortably cold environment\nso for instance if I'm really hot on a\nhot day jumping into a cold pool feels\nreally good but if I'm already kind of\nat room temperature I'm a little bit\nchilly getting into that same\ntemperature of water doesn't feel so\ngood right there's a shock there so if\nyou could just walk us through what\nhappens when we get into uncomfortably\ncold water whether or not it's by way of\nshower or cold Plunge at the level of\nour physiology and if you'd like our\npsychology I think that's a good place\nfor us to start because I think it will\nOrient people to their own experience if\nthey do that yeah and for those that\nhaven't done it might start to peel back\nsome of the the layers as to what the\nunderlying mechanisms of cold are yeah\nthank you for that question it's really\ngood to just address what actually\nhappens in our physiology when we get\ncold and you can get cold in many ways\nso you can just head out for the one\nthat gives you the most potent stressor\nwhich is submerging into cold water and\nbut you could also go in outside in the\ncold wind that's also going to activate\nyour\num your sympathetic nervous system so\nget all these neurotransmitter going in\nyour body and so your your\ncatecholamines\num let's just address that we are taking\na cold plunge for example so if you are\nvery hot for example\num before you go into the cold water\nit's going to feel less it's going to\nfeel less stressful but the the\ntemperature difference from your skin to\nthe cold is definitely it's going to\ngive you a shock but your core\ntemperature is warmer and that's going\nto feel a little bit better so that's\nwhy when people go into a sauna for\nexample and go out in into the cold\nwater they they they can do it easily\neasier them if they were called\nbeforehand could I just um ask you a few\nquestions so you you mentioned the\nsympathetic nervous system which for um\npeople listening who aren't familiar\nwith that is that the branch of our\nnervous system that's responsible for\ncreating accelerations and heart rate\num feelings of alertness it's\naccompanied with stress and the stress\nresponse but it's accompanied with\nwaking up in the morning for that matter\nso it's not always about stress and then\nyou mentioned the catecholamines which\num are dopamine epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine so maybe a little bit\nlater we'll talk about those individual\nneurotransmitters but you raise a really\nimportant point which is\nsomething I get asked about a lot for\npeople that are curious about using\ndeliberate cold exposure which is how\ncold should the water be and I know it's\nvery hard to give a straight\nprescription for that because I think it\nboils down to what you just said which\nis it's really the difference between\nyour current temperature and really the\ntemperature of the surface of your skin\nand the temperature of the water so if\nyou're very warm getting into cold feels\ngood if you're already cold getting into\nmore cold feels stressful\num is there any way that we can start to\ngauge what is the best way to approach a\ndeliberate cold exposure protocol I mean\nshould it feel uncomfortable and that\nleads into the question of how do we\nbalance the discomfort with the amount\nof time that we spend in so for instance\nif it's just a little bit uncomfortable\nwe'll spending more time in the cold get\nus the same benefit as getting into very\nuncomfortably cold water for a very\nshort period of time yeah it's really\ngood question and I definitely think\nthat this could be future studies on\nthis as well to really unravel uh what\nkind of Protocols are the are the best\nway or also for which outcomes of course\nso if the temperature is very cold and\nyou feel that you also feel very cold\nthen you should stay in the water a\nlittle bit longer so I think it's just\nyou should get uncomfortable cold so as\nlong as you get uncomfortable cold it's\ncold enough and you get this what we\ncall the code shark so the code stock is\nactivation of your sympathetic nervous\nsystem and these activation of the the\ncatecholamines which you just mentioned\nbefore does the shock mean that I'm\nhaving trouble controlling my breathing\nis that a good gauge uh yeah you can say\nso because that's kind of like how we\nDefine it so you hyperventilate so you\nhave a faster\num breathing rate\num so that increases also because you\nactivate your gasping reflex if you are\nnew to this\num but if you are adapted it it kind of\nsubsides with time with the adaptation\nso what you can do is that you can train\nthis cold exposure and you can kind of\nlike Get adapted to it so you don't have\nthis hypertension ventilating response\nevery time you go out in the cold water\nso this is like building up your\nresilience building building up your\nadaptation is gonna make this short like\nsubside a bit so it's it's always harder\nin the beginning but you should do hard\nthings right it's not something that we\nyou shouldn't think about cold water and\ncold water immersion as something that\nis comfortable it should be hard because\nthat's the point of it right if you\nenjoy it then yeah then I'm I'm thinking\nsomething is wrong it's not right you\nshould not enjoy it well this is an\nimportant point that you're making\nbecause I think that many people shy\naway from deliberate cold exposure\nbecause it's uncomfortable\nin a way that at least from my\nexperience is very different than the\ndiscomfort of exercise because with\nexercise for instance\num if running hard you know running fast\nand breathing hard is uncomfortable you\ncan slow down or walk if um you know\nlifting weights is uncomfortable you can\nremove some weight or reduce the number\nof repetitions or stop with deliberate\ncold exposure I suppose you can be sort\nof halfway in halfway out of the water\nor partially underneath the cold shower\nbut it's very hard to titrate and adjust\nthe level it's kind of all or none and\nI've seen um I should just I can tell\nthis by anecdote I've done some work\nwith military Special Operations I won't\nsay which country this was outside the\nU.S\num and these are very tough individuals\nthey're used to going without sleep and\ndoing hard high consequence higher risk\nkind of work\nand they were asked to do some cold\nwater exposure training and I was there\nthat day and it was remarkable about a\nthird of them just went straight in and\njust kind of grinded through it you know\nlike they looked stoic anyway to me\num there were a few whimpers no cries\nabout a third\num\ntalked a lot and got really you could\ntell that they were agitated and anxious\nbut they made it through and then about\na third of them just simply would not\nget in past their knees or thighs we're\njust it seemed like they were just\ndreading the whole experience someone\nactually didn't actually go in\ncompletely\num which was really surprising to me and\nthat you couldn't tell based on their\nphysical appearance or anything else\nabout them they're all high performers\nas to who would have this response so it\nseems like people vary tremendously in\nterms of their ability to embrace the\ndiscomfort of the cold is that from your\nstudies is that your experience as well\nor or are there these weird mutants who\nseem to just love going into the cold\nfor the first time so some people just\nfeel better in the cold and some people\nuh dread the code even more and you can\nsay the more people are pushing the cold\naway they might feel the co-pain even\nmore so they they they would definitely\npeople who are maybe the soldiers you\njust talked about they some of them\nmight be already adapted to the gold\ncold so if they are not scared of the\ncold they go out and they embrace the\nCOPE in a better way it could also be\nthat some people have a more sensitive\nnervous system and when you are a bit\nsensitive to the cold you will of course\ntry to get away from it right and you\nalso have the co-pain more um feel the\nco-pay more if they're if if you avoid\nit so the more you avoid the cold the\nthe more pain painful it will feel when\nyou go into it so yeah you mentioned\nbeing outside in a t-shirt versus cold\nimmersion up to the neck versus shower I\nthink um this is something a lot of\npeople wonder about what are the\ndifferences in terms of impact short\nterm\nand perhaps even long term between cold\nshowers cold plunge to the neck so that\ncould be in ice water or just very cold\nwater\nimmersion with dunking one's head and\nthen coming up because obviously people\nhave to come up for air at some point\nand then simply being outside on a cold\nday in shorts and a t-shirt or something\nof that sort so there\nit comes because they're they are very\ndifferent exposures of the cold to your\nco-receptors in your skin so the more\nyou can say you cover your body in the\ncold which you would do in cold water\nbecause there are of course covered\ntotally and then and the molecules are\ncloser to your skin you have a more\npotent\num activation of all your code receptors\nin the skin so that one will definitely\nactivate your other enormous nervous\nsystem more and Rapid compared to going\nout in a t-shirt in the cold wind just\ngo for a walk\num but that is also something that's\ngoing to activate your sympathetic\nnervous system meaning then that you\nhave an increase in norepinephrine and\nyou will activate something called the\nthe brown fat so this is a healthy kind\nof fat tissue that we have in our body\nand when you activate that that's gonna\nincrease your metabolism before we talk\nabout Brown fat and I'm so glad you\nbrought it up\num because it's so much to talk about\nthere uh what about cold shower I mean\nobviously cold showers somewhere in\nbetween yeah\num being out outside in the Air Cold Air\nversus uh being immersed up to the neck\nit if we had more studies on on cold\nshowers we would learn more about how\ndoes that activate our metabolism how\ndoes that increase our neurotransmitters\nin the brain which could also have an\nimpact our on our mental balance so I\nthink that would be interesting for the\nfuture\num but what we do know is from from from\nactivating Brown fat and both from\nrodent studies but also in humans is\nthat as soon as we get cold on our skin\nwe will activate our Brown fat so it is\nkind of like our first responder in in\nthe body to keep our\num temperature up so our muscles is like\nthe second tissue in our body we have\ntwo tissues which can increase our\nthermogenesis so the brown fat which is\nlike always like temperature regulating\nour body and then we have uh the the\nmuscles which will secondarily start to\nshiver and that's going to increase our\num temperature in the body but as soon\nas you go into a cold shower you\nactivate your brown fat also immediately\nso it could be good also for increasing\nmetabolism in theory because we haven't\nreally any studies showing how much this\nactually activate the brown fat so if\nsomeone out there wants to do a study I\nthink I've thought about why there are\nfewer studies of cold showers than cold\nimmersion and I think the answer to my\nmind is that from a methodological\nstandpoint it's just harder to do\nbecause\nif people are getting into cold water up\nto the neck they're getting into cold\nwater up to the neck whereas if people\nare getting into a cold shower some\npeople are larger or smaller some people\nare going to stand under the shower with\nit hitting their head some people the\nback of the neck you could direct people\nto do it yeah but it's a little bit um\nmore difficult also I think uh for you\nand I are both research scientists\nthere's a little bit of a um\nmethodological challenge that might seem\nsilly to people but it's a real one\nwhich is if people are in a cold shower\nalso the water is going to be I'm kind\nof pushing their clothing against their\nskin there's a certain vulnerability and\nfor most people coming to a laboratory\nin the first place let alone being\nobserved while they shower whereas when\nyou get into cold immersion cold\nimmersion you're getting under the water\nand you know some people might roll\ntheir eyes and say okay really is that\nthe barrier but you know science exists\nin these real world contexts and this\nwill vary by culture and things of that\nsort but we run human subjects in my lab\nand I'll tell you just um the process of\ngetting people to the laboratory and\nhaving them Park and find the lab and\nyou know it's a whole new environment\ngovernment with people in lab coats and\npeople moving around and Where's the\nrestroom I mean there's there's a\ncertain amount of stress just associated\nwith taking part in a study for most\nhuman subjects so\num I uh totally agree however we need\nmore studies of cold showers it's just a\nharder environment to control in my in\nmy mind so it sounds like any form of\ncold to the skin\nthat people register as what you call\nthe cold shock or uncomfortable like oh\nlike this is kind of jarring activates\nthe brown fat do we know what the\npathway is from cold receptors on the\nskin to the brown fat I mean how does\nthe brown fat know that we're cold yeah\nreally good question and this seems that\nI I think that of course in the future\nwe will know much more about these\nPathways but what we do know is that the\nco-receptors will send a signal to our\ntemperature regulating Center in in the\nbrain so hypothalamus\num and that's gonna be\num taking in this message and we have so\nmany Coke receptors in the skin so it's\ngoing to be very fast as you can say if\nyou immerse the body into cold water\nthis is going to be so rapid so it will\nhave a rapid increase in\nneurotransmitters in the brain so no\nadrenaline adrenaline and cortisol and\nwhich is not that much but it's but it's\nstill there so you have this increase in\nno adrenaline which will then\nimmediately activate the the brown fat\nbecause the you can say the activator is\nthe most potent one cold and no\nadrenaline and that's going to activate\nthe brow fat but there's also a direct\npathway from the cold receptors in the\nskin to the to the brown fat which\nreally shows that if because of these\ndifferent Pathways it shows that that it\ncould be that this tissue to keep us\nwarm was was\ndeveloped in in our evolvement as humans\nto keep us warm and to save us whenever\nthe temperature now on our skin berries\njust a little bit to keep us in that\nright homeostatic balance so we don't\nget hypothermic\num but also so we don't get hyperthermic\nbut because it seems that the brown fat\nis also activated when we get warmer on\nour skin so it's also um maybe a\ntemperature regulator in our in our body\nbut the pathways is different I think\nit's also a third pathway from directly\nfrom the muscles so the brown fat is\nalso at\num even though the muscles are starting\nto shiver so there's an extra pathway\nthat way to keep our our temperature up\nso muscles and brown fat are working\ntogether to to keep us warm so we don't\nsuffer too much in the in the cold water\nit's super interesting and what I here\nare you pointing to is the existence of\nthree parallel Pathways and this notion\nof parallel Pathways comes up over and\nover again in biology as you and I know\nand I mean I think it's important for\npeople to know about because\num as you uh said so so eloquently the\nwhen something is very important to our\nsurvival or and or evolution\nthe brain and body uh install multiple\nmechanisms for it not just one and um\nand so it sounds like it's cold skin\ncold on the skin triggers a response in\nthe hypothalamus which then activates\nBrown fat cold receptors in the skin\ndirectly to the brown fat and then\nshivering in the muscle to the brown fat\num I want to talk about Brown fat in\ndepth and learn from you more about\nBrown fat\num before that however I want to ask\nabout shiver\num I've heard that shiver\ncauses the release of succinate\num which then activates the brown fat is\nit known whether or not inducing shiver\nis important and when should P people\nShiver I mean I've gotten into cold\nplunges and shivered while I was in\nthere and then I've also had the\nexperience\nof getting into a coal plunger a cold\nshower then getting out or even standing\noutside on a warm day after swimming in\na pool and then starting to shiver so\nthe shiver comes later so how important\nis shiver and does it matter when shiver\nhappens\nyeah it was shivering is good because\nthat increases your metabolism and\nthat's going to burn some calories in\nyour body you shouldn't be so afraid of\nshivering I think because the Shivering\nas long as you don't get too hypothermic\nso if you don't if you don't sit in the\ncold water for too long\num and what you just said by shivering\nafter you get up that is because of the\nafter drop something called the after\ndrop is when your core temperature\ndecreases even after you get out of the\ncold water and it always does that\num your body because it as soon as you\nget into the cold water all the your\nblood vessels is gonna constrict because\nyou need to keep your blood in your core\nand and keep your vital organ swarm so\nas soon as you get up that those blood\nvessels will open again and the warm\nblood will flow out and get colder and\nthen flow back again into the core and\nthat's going to decrease the temperature\nin your core of course so that's the\ndrop so that's the drop yeah I'm so glad\nyou explained that I've heard years ago\ngo Wim Hof I heard him talk about the\ndrop and I've heard colleagues of mine\ntalk about the drop but that's the first\ntime I've ever heard it explained\nclearly let me make sure I understand\nthis so um I get into cold water\nobviously I'm cold\nvessels constrict to keep blood near the\ncenter of my body keep me alive\nI get out\nthe\nwarming up of my body allows those\nvessels and capillaries to dilate again\nthe blood goes out to the surface but\nthe surface is still cold and so that\nblood is cooled and then my core body\ntemperature drops and that's what you're\nreferring to as the drop and that's what\ninduces shiver exactly right and then am\nI right in thinking that then the shiver\nactivates Brown fat which then warms me\nup again yes that's why you should end\non the cold but we can get back to that\nyeah let's talk about yes ending on cold\nis um you know it's what I refer to as\nand what has now become known as the\nsoberg principle which is um a really\nimportant principle about the importance\nof ending on cold\num and not doing what I do which is to\nget into a hot shower or back in the\nsunroom we'll get back to that in a few\nminutes so\num that's wonderful\num that you can explain that so clearly\nbecause I think that shiver is something\nthat a lot of people do avoid people\nthink oh I don't want to you know the\nchattering of the teeth and um and it\nfeels like a loss of bodily control\nwhich really it is it's it's an\nautonomic response yeah but I don't\nthink that people should should avoid it\nthat much it's just like seeing\nshivering as a way of your body in in a\nlike it's training it's training for\nyour for all yourselves it's training\nfor your muscles it's training up your\nmetabolism and that's going to increase\nyour What's called the insulin\nsensitivity so if you can like in your\nmind get used to the thought of\nshivering is just like when you go\nexercising in the training center and\nget that feeling of like oh this is\ntough now it hurts a little bit yeah\nit's gonna hurt because that's what\nshivering also does but it's just a\ndifferent way of training your cells and\nyour body it's going to create what is\nhealthy stress it's called homiesis in\nthe cells and the more you expose your\nyour muscle cells or your brown fat\ncells to these kind of like healthy\nstresses exercise cold and heat exposure\nit's gonna make them better at like\nactivate trading and also um at keeping\nyou healthy so as long as the cells get\nexposed to this it's going to keep them\non its toes you can say because it\nbecomes more robust and increasing these\nheat shock proteins and kosher proteins\nin the cells to make you more robust for\nthe next time and that is also what\nhappens when you go to the training\ncenter and I keep like drawing that\nparallel because people today know more\nabout we know more about exercise and\nwhat that is is going to do to your\nmuscle cells and and but the same kind\nof like training is also what you do\nwhen you go out and and into the cold\nwater and submerge into cold water\nbecause that is just your code training\ncenter you can say that and and also\nyour heat Training Center going into the\nsauna because the cells are getting\nstronger with hermetic stress so it's\nthe same process just different\npractices\nI'm so glad that you brought up the fact\nthat the discomfort or the embarrassment\nor both of shiver is still crucial to uh\nactually to reach for and try and\nexperience the same way that with\nexercise\num I think a lot of people don't realize\nthis but when we did our series with Dr\nAndy Galpin\nit became clear to me what should have\nalready been clear to me and I think\nthat most people don't realize which is\nthat if we were to measure heart rate\nblood pressure stress hormones and\ninflammation\nin a human being during exercise it\nwould look as if they were ready to die\nblood pressure would be high\ninflammation is through the roof but all\nof that is setting in motion and\nadaptation or set of adaptations that\nallow blood pressure to be lower at rest\nthat allow inflammation markers to be\nlower at rest all the things that\neverybody is seeking with exercise in\naddition to of course the aesthetic\nchanges that people are seeking with\nexercise sounds like the exact same\nthings are happening with the cold so\nthe Redundant message here seems to be\nthat the more discomfort provided it's\ndone safely just like with exercise the\nmore shivering\nthe um the more cold shock provided it's\nnot to the extreme and stop somebody's\nheart right we can talk about thresholds\nfor that a little bit later\nit sounds like all of that is going to\nset in motion some long-term changes\nthat will make people feel better and\nwill improve health could you just touch\non a few of the longer term changes that\nare known to occur\nI mean I'm well aware of the study\nshowing that uh I think it was European\nJournal physiology it was uh the\nEuropean Journal physiology showing long\nlasting increases in catecholamines\ndopamine norepinephrine and epinephrine\nfor many hours after deliberate cold\nexposure what are some of the other\nthings that happen at the level of\nmetabolism and brown fat in let's say\nthe hours and day after a deliberate\ncold exposure\nas soon as you go in of course there's\nan activation but it seems like no\nyou're asking for the the later outcomes\nlike blood pressure and stuff like that\nis that what you mean yeah blood\npressure but also in terms of metabolism\nI know that you know in your study you\nshould and we'll talk about Brown fat in\ndepth here in a moment but that there\nwere changes to the brown fat that\nequate to changes in for instance\npeople's ability to be comfortable in\ncolder environments when they're not\ndoing deliberate cold exposure or in the\nsame way that I can um exercise on an\nexercise bike or go for a hard run but\nthen if I go hiking uh with the family\non Sunday and it's a steep climb I could\ndo that steep climb more easily because\nI'm quote unquote fit as a consequence\nof the of the exercise what are what are\nsome of the fitness adaptations of\ndeliberate cold exposure\nyeah so what happens is that you you get\nadapted a little bit every time you go\nso you will like exercise get a Little\nBit Stronger so every time you go into\nthe cold water for every time you will\nbe more exposed to it you will you feel\nmore comfortable in the code so you're\ngonna you're gonna build your adaptation\nwhich happens on a metabolic level which\nis going to be the brown fat so you'll\nhave more activation of your brown fat\nthe mitochondria in the the brown fat\ncells are going to be\num you have more of those and they will\nbe more efficient at heating you up\nbecause it expects the body expects you\nto to do this again so you are prepared\nin a way the capillaries in your skin is\nalso it will also become better at like\nconstricting so you will have a better\nShield of your body to prepare you for\nthe next time so you will be become\nbetter at going into the cold water in\nthat way so the body makes this\nmechanism and changes your body in a way\nso you can expose yourself to the next\ntime right and and also you will have um\nalso um your um stress response will\nalso be subside a bit so you have a less\nincrease of your catecholamines\num with time\nwith time also you have because of this\nactivation of your brown fat or your\nmuscles you have an increase in them in\nin your metabolism which will then make\nyour insulin sensitivity better and this\nis shown in in studies for example um\nthere's this interesting study I found\njust before I I started my PhD which was\nfrom um keeper stoma\num at L from 2016 where they measured um\nmetabolism\nand not in not on Brown fat but they\nmeasured insulin sensitivity in\nmiddle-aged men and women during one\nwinter swimming season so they were not\nvery young like they were in my study\nbut they were they were middle aged and\nI think this is very interesting so they\nduring these four or five months they\nwere winter swimming they saw that they\nhad a lower blood pressure after the\nseason and they had a lower heart rate\nand they also so that they have a better\ninsulin sensitivity and I think that is\nvery interesting because if you can have\na better insulin sensitivity you can\nprevent lifestyle diseases so and with\nlower blood pressure which is a very\nstrong outcome also for selling how much\ninflammation you have in the body and\nbecause it didn't measure Brown fat I\nfigured that it could be that was the\nmissing link that was the one of the\nexplanations to why we see this um less\ninflammation in the body\nso um the longer outcomes the long-term\noutcomes could be that you lower your\nblood pressure and have a lower heart\nrate and you also\num have a better insulin sensitivity and\nbetter glucose balance but that was\nshown it that is shown in my study I'd\nlike to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic greens since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health and those\nprobiotics and athletic greens are\noptimal and vital for microbiotic health\nin addition athletic greens contains a\nnumber of adaptogens vitamins and\nminerals that make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs are met\nand it tastes great if you'd like to try\nathletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 and\nwe'll get back to the insulin\nsensitivity and glucose balance that's a\nin an impressive list of benefits\num you know blood pressure of course\nmost people are aware of blood pressure\nand what it is it's what they measure\nwhen we go to the doctor and it's not\nvery sexy nowadays you know blood\npressure people oh you know blood\npressure it's not you know people want\nto hear about the inflammatorium and the\nmicrobiome and all of that stuff is\nreally interesting but\num I think that blood pressure doesn't\nget enough\nattention\nand we have spoken to on this podcast to\nDr Peter attia who um is an expert in\nlongevity and health span and things of\nthat sort and and I was surprised to\nlearn again I shouldn't have been\nsurprised that the number one reason\npeople die worldwide is cerebral\nvascular disease and cardiovascular\ndisease and there are basically three\nthings on the list of things to address\none is not smoking or vaping by the way\nuh not to get there are a few other\nthings related to blood markers apob and\nthings of that sort but then the big one\nis blood pressure and so it's it's\ninteresting because we don't think about\nblood pressure that much anymore\num as a as the kind of people interested\nin health optimization and health but\nblood pressure is so vital to control so\nit's wonderful to hear that deliberate\ncold exposure is one way to control\nblood pressure I'm guessing in concert\nwith other forms of exercise yeah um\nlet's talk about Brown fat and um if you\nif you're willing I'd love to drill into\nBrown fat at a deep level\num again my understanding of this is is\nfar more Elementary than yours\nobviously you're the expert my\nunderstanding about Brown fat\nis that it's located in specific areas\nof our body\nuh maybe more widespread than when I\nlearned in school I thought it was I was\ntaught it was just at the clavicles in\nthe back of the neck and upper back but\nwho knows I learned that there's more of\nit when we're children\nmaybe more distributed throughout our\nbody\nand that it's rich in mitochondria but\nwhat is so special about the brown fat\nlike if we could just go into the\nbiology of brown fat a little bit what\ndoes it look like you've measured it in\nhuman subjects where is it distributed\nreally can it expand its distribution\ncan we activate and expand the amount of\nbrown fat as adults and um for those of\nyou that are cringing already thinking\nwe're talking about getting fatter it's\nquite the opposite we're talking about\nnot subcutaneous fat but fat located\naround the the organs but please educate\nme um tell me where I'm wrong and expand\nmy knowledge on Brown fat\nokay yeah you're not wrong but um it's\ndefinitely it's true that there are more\nlocations of the brown fat than we\npreviously thought\num there's this very nice study from\n2017 by Leitner L where they had made\nthese opacities uh overlays of um their\nsubjects but you can see where in the\nbody do we have brown fat and where can\nwe grow more Brown fat\num so to say um so the brown fat is is\nvery plastic so it means that it can it\ncan grow and they can decrease and this\nis proven in in studies where we have\nseen um\num people with a fair cryocytoma it's\nlike a very specific cancer type where\npeople where from the 70s where we can\nsee that if they have this specific kind\nof a cancer type\num they have a they have this tumor on\nthe adrenal gland so they have like a\nhuge increase in NOAA adrenaline and\nbecause of that you don't have this\ncontinuous activation of the brown fat\nand they have grown a lot of brown fat\nin the whole body or abdominal where\nit's located in these six different\nplaces but it is just like very much\ncompared to like normal people\num and what they then see what we\nlearned from this study is that brown\nfat can apparently grow if you have an\nincrease in no adrenaline in the body\nit's not like you want that because when\nthat happens you have a high blood\npressure you don't want it chronically\nright you just want it on like a short\namount of time and then it can grow for\na bit but you don't want it chronically\nof course not but because it it\nactivates also your sympathetic nervous\nsystem so they have also showed they\nhave high blood pressure they had\nthey lost a lot of weight of course\nbecause this is activating your\nmetabolism so they they found luckily\nthat when they removed this benign a\ntumor uh that uh the brown fat\num decreases again to normal size and\nthey gain weight again and they had\nnormal blood pressure so the story ends\nwell but it's kind of like proof of\nconcept of the brown fat can actually\ngrow so it's plastic in its in its way\nof like it can grow and it can decrease\nagain so that's very good good studies\nto to see what what the body is capable\nof but we don't of course want all that\nbrown fat we just want it to be um we\njust want to keep it actually and keep\nit activated because what we see in\nstudies is also that after the age of 40\nand people\num Studies have shown that there is an\nassociation with having less brown fat\nbut increased obesity so of course we we\ndon't know yet whether a brown fat\ndecreases with A's and therefore before\nwe get obese or we get obese and\ntherefore we have less brown fat but as\nbrown fat is an insulin sensitive organ\nin our body and we get obese just like\nthe muscles get less sensitive insulin\nsensitive the brown fat does as well and\ntherefore it maybe decreases it could be\na theory that I think could be one of\nthe reasons why we don't see that much\nBrown fat in in elderly people some have\na lot especially people working outside\nthere are studies showing this who\npeople who work outside do physical work\noutside farmers and\num yeah interesting yeah yeah thanks\npost themselves to it so they'll just\nkeep it in that way it's\num and I suppose we should um clarify\nfor people in case they don't know that\ninsulin sensitivity is a very good thing\nyou want that you want your cells to be\nsensitive to insulin insulin\ninsensitivity is type 2 diabetes and is\nassociated with obesity\num so just a point of clarification\nthere\nuh yeah it's interesting to me I I I\nusually work out at home but I go to a\ngym once or twice a week if I can\nbecause it's good if I see uh the\noutside world\num and there are a few individuals at\nthe the gym who are they're not\nparticularly large or muscular\num but they are incredibly\num lean and their posture is great\npresumably from the musculoskeletal work\num and they they're in their 70s and 80s\nI mean it's remarkable right and um and\nI know all the telltale signs of hormone\naugmentation I'm very good at spotting\nthat there are a few telltale signs I've\ntalked about this on other podcasts and\nthey're not that's not why they're\nthey're they're they're\num they're fit they're they're clearly\nof that look and you see this written\noutside the gym too of course for people\nthat look like they've done a lot of\nphysical labor their whole life yeah\nthey're just moving a lot they have\nstrong hands and features and they're\num and they're not necessarily except\naggressively lean but you can tell that\nthey've been using their musculoskeletal\nsystem and I like to talk to these\npeople and ask them like not what are\nyou doing now for your workout but what\nwhat did you grow up doing you know and\nI would say and obviously I haven't run\nstatistics on this but\nmore than 75 percent of them respond\nthat they grew up on a farm\nor that they did some sort of\nmanual labor or were a postman or a\npostwoman or doing something where they\nmoved a lot for their early years and\nthroughout middle age and most of them\nare now in retirement but some of them\nare still working and they all still\nmoving a lot so\nthe relationship between shiver and\nbrown fat makes sense to me but is it\nthe case that as we're just moving\naround I've heard of neat non-exercise\ninduced thermogenesis so if we're just\nmoving around that we are activating\nBrown fat or does there need to be this\nstressor does there need to be shiver\nand a cold stimulus or a heat stimulus\nto activate the brown fat in other words\nis just staying active enough or do we\nneed to do some sort of temperature uh\nshock type thing like deliberate cold\nexposure yeah I think that is a really\ngood question because how how also why\ndo we have this tissue then if it's if\nit has to be extreme then you can\nquestion what what do we need this\ntissue for but it seems that you can\nactivate the brown fat with just a\nlittle bit of exposure to to cold so\ncold is the most potent stress or\nactivator of our Brown fat because it's\nour temperature regulating organ in our\nbody so first responder to that so the\nmuscles will be a little bit too late\nand therefore we have maybe these two\nkind of tissues so actually just\nexposing yourself or a hand actually\njust to cold water so Studies have shown\num that if you just put your hand in\ncold water not that you're going to\ngoing to do that all day or or every day\nor anything it's not it's it's not\nsomething you have to do but it just\nshows that you can activate your brown\nfat just by getting a temperature change\non your skin so you can go outside and\nt-shirts that's why also we were just\ntalking about well people who works\noutside or move a lot or get out in and\nout of it like changing the temperature\nof the body all the time they will have\nmore Brown fat and activating that is\ngoing to keep your metabolism higher and\nyour insulin sensitivity is that it has\nalso shown this so the brown fat can be\nactivated as soon as you just change\nyour temperature in the skin so going\noutside in a t-shirt wearing cooling\nvests also Studies have shown this for\n10 days it's gonna also grow your your\nbrown fat so you can get more Brown fat\nif you expose yourself to the cold you\ndon't have to start in a cold shower you\ndon't have to start in a cold plunge if\nyou're not really ready for that yet but\njust exposing yourself to a wind has\nalso shown to activate your brown fat or\nif you don't want to be like in this\nawake state then you can also just sleep\nin the cold and you won't notice it that\nmuch maybe but Studies have shown that\nif you sleep in 19 degrees Celsius and\nthen you will activate your brown fat\nand you will grow your ground fat so you\nhave more of it so this is in very nice\nstudies\num\nfrom Hansen Adele from 2017 showed that\na group of subjects who slept in a room\nat 24 degrees and then they made this\nPet City scannings to see how much Brown\nfat do they have from the beginning so\nwhat we call Baseline then they measured\nagain after a month of sleeping in 19\ndegrees and they saw I think it's\nremarkable just one month at 19 degrees\nsleeping there they had a duet on and\nthey were still had clothes on when they\nwere sleeping so they're under a\ncovered yeah yeah the subjects were\nsleeping\none month had increased is insulin\nsensitivity the next month they stepped\nat 24 degrees they measured this again\nand then they had decreased actually a\nlittle bit and then they slept at 27\ndegrees so quite warm room actually for\nfor the fourth month um and they saw a\neven less activation of the brown fat\nand also insulin sensitivity so it seems\nthat you can expose yourself and pretty\nrapidly the brown fat will respond to\nthis because it's so sensitive to no\nadrenaline right so if you keep exposing\nyourself to a little bit of coal you\nalso get a little bit adapted to it but\nthat's because the brown fat\num has grown these more mitochondria in\nthe cells so these small energy Fabrics\nthat's going to activate the cells and\nthat's going to take up glucose and fat\nfrom the fatty acids from the\nbloodstream to keep the thermogenesis up\nand that's going to clear up some sugar\nand it's going to click so in the in the\nbloodstream and some some fat as well so\nthe brown fat can in that way decrease\nour unhealthy fat which is the white fat\nand the white fat is what we don't want\ntoo much of but we still need some of\ncourse\nand it's our energy storage so it's very\nimportant that it's there we just don't\nneed a lot of it so on our thighs and\nalso around our inner organs that's\nwhere it's it's located so if we can\nhave activation of the brown fat just by\ngoing out in the cold and just by\nsleeping in a cold room or if you are\nhave courage for it you can go out and\nexpose yourself in a coat plunge\num cold showers is also going to do the\ntrick so you can do different variations\nof this just exposing yourself to\nvarious temperatures it's going to\nactivate the brown fat because it was\ninvolved to keep us in a perfect\nhomeostatic balance regarding\ntemperature so to Keep Us Alive\nincredible uh I want to just get a\nclarification around this 19 degrees\nCelsius room that they're sleeping in so\nthey're under a comforter a duvet and um\nand you mentioned they had clothes on\nthe room is 19 degrees Celsius but the\ntemperature underneath their blanket\nmight not be 19 degrees Celsius so\npresumably it's the cold on their face\nthat's activating uh the the increase in\nbrown fat that was observed is that is\nthat a reasonable expectation I I think\nso yeah because it's you have so many\nco-receptors in your face so it's\nactually it's enough and I think it\ncorresponds very well with the studies\nshowing that you can activate the brown\nfat just by putting a hand into a bucket\nof cold water and I did this experiment\nmyself in in my studies just to see how\nwell did they respond to cold water so\nit was a four degrees Celsius cold water\nfor four minutes and then I just met\nyour blood pressure on heart rate to see\ndo they have like an activation of this\nI actually also measured the brown fat\nduring this cold exposure for four\nminutes with an infrared thermography\ncamera to see can I see that the brown\nfat is activated and just just to go\nback to the location of the brown fat so\nusually you cannot really see activation\nof your brown fat because it's located\ncentrally in your around your central\nnervous system\num and and the biggest Depot as you\nmentioned before is up here under the\nclavicular bones so\num and very close to the skin surface\nand because it's so close to the skin\nsurface I could measure it with this\nvery expensive camera here and it's not\nvery feasible for people to go home and\ndo this don't because it takes a lot of\npractice I can tell\num but we measured the brown fat with\nthis um and and I could see that after a\nfew minutes that the activation was\nthere an increase in temperature arose\nfrom that activation just four minutes\nso it's very rapid and I'm also measured\nin my study how deep was the brown fat\nunder your skin so it's very close to\nthe surface which also shows that it it\nneeds to be there to heat you up and\nheat your inner organs well I'm\ndelighted to hear all of this and I'll\ntell you why one is by way of anecdote I\nmentioned a little bit earlier that as\nan undergraduate I worked in a lab that\nstudied thermogenesis and we were doing\nthat in animals but we had this room\nthat was very cold the whole room was\ncalled the guy who I worked for at the\ntime and I'm Harry Carlyle is a very\naccomplished physiologist he came from\nthis lineage I don't know if this\nliterature is still um discussed much\nbut it's a beautiful literature\num from Rothwell and stock they were the\nones who discovered um non-exercise\ninduced thermogenesis the fact that\npeople bounce who bounce their legs a\nlot and move around a lot and have a lot\nof kind of um stochastic movement\num burn up to 18\n00 calories more per day than people who\nsit more still fascinating incredible\nand just incredible\num I don't think that work does gets as\nmuch attention as it deserves publishing\njournals like nature so very uh fine\njournals but in any event\nuh one of the things that I noticed when\nI started working in that laboratory was\nthat I was cold because the room was\ncold and um Dr Carlisle Harry\num said well the key is to wear a\nt-shirt in here for about two or three\ndays and then you will cold adapt I\nthought well wouldn't I want to put on a\nhoodie and get warm in there so I was\ncomfortable and he said no actually what\nyou want to do is get yourself\nuncomfortably cold activate your brown\nfat and indeed when I did that I think\nit was just two days of being in that\ncold environment then I could come back\non the third day and be perfectly\ncomfortable yeah because the brown fat\nhad expanded\num or or added mitochondria or both and\nI was perfectly comfortable in that\nenvironment I also got very very lean in\nthose um in those days and weeks now\nI've never been somebody who's very lean\nnor am I somebody who carries a lot of\nexcess adipose tissue I'm kind of\nsomewhere in the middle I'm sure I could\nadjust that with feeding if I want to\nbut it was it was striking uh what a\npowerful effect it had on my entire\nsystem of thermal regulation and one of\nthe things that I uh also delighted in\nwhen cell reports\num medicine published your study is they\nhad in an accompanying um press release\nthat went out to to those of us that\nreceived press releases and it described\na um a saying in Scandinavia which is um\nessentially I'm not going to attempt to\nuh speak uh Danish even though I have\nmuch of my family is in Denmark I\nbelieve or not from Denmark\num we have a lot of Danes in my family\num I won't embarrass myself by trying to\nspeak Danish as I did before the the\nmicrophones were rolling but\num that there's a saying that I think\nessentially translates to in the fall\nwhen when you're approaching winter you\nwant to actually wear fewer layers not\nbundle up when you go outside so that\nyou can prepare yourself for the cold of\nwinter and be able to heat yourself up\nusing your brown fat and that in the\nspring as the temperatures are warming\nrather than removing layers you want to\nwear more layers in order to be a little\nbit uncomfortably warm so that In the\nHeat of the summer you're better at\ncooling your body do I have that right\nand maybe do you know the saying and\nwould you be willing to share it only\nthe swedes and um uh and Danes will be\nable to understand\num maybe the Norwegians too if you don't\nknow it that's okay yeah so I know that\nI know the the concept of it because we\nsay it you should you should wear a less\nbefore winter and and more before summer\nso there it is in English so it doesn't\nhave to be esoteric but okay yeah and\nand you're completely right and I think\nthis is the this is just something that\nwe know in the Scandinavian countries I\nthink that we we\nintuitively know this but if we just go\nback a little bit in history I think\nthat um around the 1950s the the Russian\ngovernment went out and said well we\nshould do something about the\ntuberculosis pandemic or epidemic make\nthe worse at the this time so that they\nwanted to have the the people\num\nbe more resilient to the cold and also\nincrease our immune system so in\nScandinavia and actually also in Russia\nwe put our babies outside to sleep in\nthe prom and that is like to uh also to\nto get more resistance to the coal but\nalso to increase our immune system and\nwe still do that in Denmark so we we\nreally yeah we do babies are taken out\nin the cold in the snow in Frosty rain\neverything my two boys have been\nsleeping out in winter or at least the\ntheir first many three four five years\nbecause it's like very good for them and\nthey get a better immune system and get\nresilient to the cold so they will have\nless colds and also they run around in a\nt-shirt when it's super cool because\nthey have activated all the brown fat I\ndidn't understand at that time I must I\nmust say but I kind of like intuitively\nalso knew because we have inherited this\nway of doing things with our culture so\nand I have heard people coming from the\nU.S saying things are crazy they put the\nbabies outside and problems and leave\nthem there and then they go inside and\ndrink coffee on the cafe\nwell I don't think Danes are crazy I I I\nI Adore the date they're amazing uh\nculture and people I'm so fortunate to\nhave family members uh from Denmark but\nI did notice so when when we were in\nCopenhagen and I know um we we saw you\nthere uh not long ago that was June\num the water in the harbor was was cold\nfor even though the Pacific is close to\nhere which is very cold I was felt\npretty cold but I it was summertime ish\num so people were in summertime mode\nright t-shirts and shorts and things\nthat that sort but it did strike me that\npeople in Copenhagen are\ndramatically fitter than they are in the\nUnited States I mean first of all\neveryone's bicycling everywhere yeah\num not many people wearing sunglasses so\ntrying to extract as much Photon energy\nfrom the Sun as possible which I support\nuh as everyone knows that's I'm a big\nfan of getting Sun but also\num when we did see swimmers\num they were swimming in this cold water\nand like it was nothing and their the\nrange in age of the swimmers was what\nwas remarkable you saw the kind of fit\ntriathlete looking types but also young\nkids like really young kids and then\npeople probably in there again they're\nthey're 70s 80s maybe even 90s really uh\nremarkable uh vastly different than what\nyou see if you go to the ocean here in\nLos Angeles or or elsewhere so\num yeah you Scandinavians are on to\nsomething with this I'd like to take a\nquick break and thank our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone the simple reason that many of the\nfactors that impact your immediate and\nlong-term Health can only be assessed\nwith a quality blood test the problem\nwith a lot of blood and DNA tests out\nthere however is that they'll give you\ninformation about certain lipid markers\nor hormone markers but no information\nabout what to do with all of that data\ninside tracker makes it very easy to\nlook at your levels of hormones\nmetabolic factors lipids Etc and then to\nassess what sorts of Behavioral\nnutritional supplementation or perhaps\nother interventions you might want to\nuse in order to bring those numbers into\nthe ranges that are optimal for your\nhealth inside tracker's ultimate plan\nnow includes three new hormone markers\nthat are critical to measure during a\nwoman's reproductive and menopausal\nyears these are estradiol progesterone\nand thyroid stimulating hormone if you'd\nlike to try inside tracker you can go to\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside trackers plans again\nthat's inside tracker.com huberman to\nget 20 off\nI'd like to talk about your study\nif you could give us a little bit of the\nbackdrop about what motivated that study\nand then um and then walk us through\nwhat you did you know who the subjects\nwere\num what you had them do what you\nmeasured\num in as much detail as you would like\nto share because I think it's such an\nimportant you know even fair to say\nlandmark study because it also explored\nnot just cold but sauna and the the\nco-use of cold and sauna as a way to\nprobe metabolism and brown fat and other\nmarkers as well and as you do this uh\nI'm hoping at some point that you might\ntell us some of the observations that\nyou might have made that interested you\nthat perhaps were not in the paper\nbecause that's one of the great benefits\nof sitting across from somebody who who\ndid the work in detail so um yeah if you\ncould tell us about your study um and uh\nwhat you did and what you discovered\nthank you for the question Andrew I I'd\nlove to like also explain a little bit\nwhat did we do because when people read\nthis kind of paper they just see the\nnumbers they don't see what what\nhappened before that and human studies\nare very different from from my study my\nstudies you can do a knockout of\nsomething and then everything is like\nperfectly matched and controlled doing\nhumans studies is very far different\nfrom that because people are different\neven in the groups so yeah but what we\num\nwhen I started this research in 2016 I\ndid not really know what the brown fat\nwas so I started reading up on all this\nand I was very interested in preventive\nmedicine and also the studies that I did\nbefore Brown fat was also like very much\nin the preventive side like how can we\nthat was about something else but the\nSweet Tooth and how can we lower our\nsweet tooth and stuff like that so but\nafter that I wanted to to do something\nnew so I looked into the brown fat got\nhired in this fantastic research group\nwhere they it's a cell group so they\nmostly did cell studies and they didn't\nhave anyone to do a human study yet\num and um but they really wanted me to\nto do that so I read upon a lot of\nresearch about how does the brown fat\nget activated what have been done\nalready and I mentioned the paper before\nwith sleeping in the cold I found that\nparticular paper very fascinating and\nthat was also where\num at that time I was like okay so cold\nexposure sure as an intervention of\nsleeping in the cold could be a good\nthing to go out and say well people do\nthis but on the other hand is first of\nall it was already done that was one\nthing but the other thing was like well\nI wanted to to see if we can do it like\nsome kind of activity so we can have\npeople move also go and do something do\nsomething together or whatever and and\nthe code made us think about well what\nabout winter swimming and it was kind of\nlike a bit of a joke in the beginning\nit's like winter swimming yeah it's\ngoing to activate the brown fat right\nbut but when we read the literature we\ncouldn't really find anything about\nactivation of the brown fat with cold\nwater besides hand in a bucket of cold\nwater that really that was already there\nso we were just thinking okay so it\nshould be very potent\num activation of the brown fat if it's\ncold water but very different from cold\nair so it was kind of also a new thing\nwe were going into and we knew that we\nwere going to do like a more of a proof\nof concept study at the beginning of it\nbecause it was like winter swimmers\num most in theory activate the brown fat\nright but we kind of didn't really know\nwith was this kind of stressor too much\ntoo little or what will happen actually\nbut we had this idea about well we\nalways say that cold water and winter\nswimming will activate your metabolism\nbut do but do we know if it does that no\nwe don't so\num and while this idea was a little bit\nfun fun at the beginning and we kind of\naccepted it it was like okay let's just\ntry this out but because we didn't have\nthe funding for it we was like okay\nlet's do a proof of concept study\num let's go with a small number but\nenough to see um a difference between\nthe groups so the power calculation of\nthat study is done on what we know from\nPet City scannings of the brown fat so\nthat's the main outcome of that of\ncourse so\num and we wanted to go a little bit\nsmaller on the numbers of participants\nbecause we wanted to dig a little bit\ndeeper into the different mechanisms and\nalso redo some of the the days so I\nreally wanted to do that to see if I can\nreplicate also the findings and that's\ngoing to take a lot of a lot of funding\nbut it's also going to take a lot of\ntime to do it\num so the proof of concept was just\ngoing small but looking at different\nmechanisms we also took\num fat biopsies for example and looked\nat the white fat to see if there was any\ndifferences between the groups before\nand after and stuff like that so that's\nkind of like how it started and and the\nfirst year was like a field study for me\nso I was not a winter swimmer when I\nstarted this it was just oh really no I\nwasn't\num at all and I would say I was a bit\nafraid of the cold myself a bit of a\ncold uh always cold having big\nsocks on and sweaters and stuff like\nthat so I was like I am so comfortable\nI'm just like everybody else very\ncomfortable I like being income\ncompletely temperature neutral and but I\nstarted like playing with this thought\nlike well if this is so healthy in\ntheory I should not pack myself up I\nshould start not doing that\nyeah but the first year observation of\nwinter swimmers under Jetty they kind of\njoked about is they come on you need to\ntry this you cannot study this um unless\nyou have tried it\nand I was like haha very funny of course\nI can do that\nbut I couldn't I I read the literature I\nunderstood in theory what happens when\nyou go into cold water but I completely\nunderstood it when I first tried it the\nfirst few times not so funny it felt\npainful it was just like running too\nlong after a long break and you and your\nmuscles hurt the day after right you you\ncompletely regret that you took that\nextra mile what about when you say\nuncomfortable you mean uncomfortable\nwhen you got in and when you were in or\nuncomfortable afterwards because I find\nthat um on rare occasions well I should\njust a full disclosure I I do deliberate\ncold exposure every morning for about a\nminute to two minutes in a cold plunge\nthere are days that I miss but when I'm\nat home I do that and when I travel I do\na cold shower I do finish with a warm\nshower so um and we'll talk about why\nthat's probably not the best idea but um\nand I've been doing it for some years\nnow\num on and off uh but so just full\ndisclosure I'm a devotee\num and I have family members that uh\nhate the the cold but have gotten into\nit and and are starting to like it but\nthey don't and I don't necessarily like\nthe experience in the cold water but I\nlove the way I feel when I get out and I\nhave I'm a hundred percent on that\nstatement about loving it when I get out\noccasionally it feels good to be in\nthere it feels invigorating and I think\nI've learned to control the gasp reflex\nand the hyperventilation and I just have\ntold myself what we know which is that\nthe forebrain struggles to engage for\nthe first 20 or 30 seconds but if you\ncan get past that wall it's it's far\neasier to to push through\num but when you say that it was really\nuncomfortable do you mean the experience\nof getting in or you also felt lousy\nafterward yeah it's and very important\nto clear that out I only felt very\nuncomfortable doing it at the moment but\nafterwards the first time I went with\nwith the group and actually my husband\nwas there as well because I I really\nwanted someone I knew\num coming along because it's very normal\nif you haven't done this before you feel\na little bit anxious about it and this\nis jonon studies as well because blood\npressure and heart rate goes up in in\nthose who are new to this kind of\nactivity so um I was a little bit\nanxious about it so it was really\nuncomfortable just doing it but\nafterwards as soon as I got up I felt\nfantastic and we went into the sauna and\nI did three rounds because I just loved\nit I loved the feeling afterwards\nbecause you have all these nutrients\nminutes going in your brain and you feel\nmore positive you feel I feel invigorate\nI had so much energy and that like I I\ncould totally see why people would do\nthis to get energy throughout the day\nbecause I definitely had that I didn't\nhave to do 3 three dips to to get that I\nthink one would be enough and I often do\nthat also now today I do one dip\nsometimes I do two or three dips in in\none round you can say in one day but\noften it's like just one or two times a\nweek for me that is enough to to get\nthat energy and to get that positive\nfeeling and and I think that that is\nalso why I I put up my study in that way\nI wanted to study the lowest dose you\ncan say the lowest amount that we can\nget away with but still see\num health benefits so what I observed\nthere on the jetty was that some did it\na long time they were in the water for a\nvery long time and to me it seemed maybe\na little bit extreme could you give me\nan example of long time well so maybe\nthey were like really swimming and they\ncould be 20 minutes or half an hour\nthat's a long time that's a long time\nand there was like ice and people who\ncame up I mean\nI just didn't really feel that this is\nsomething that I wanted to go out and\nrecommend to people after my community\nresearch subjects dying either because\nif you're not adapted I mean the people\nyou know people can do that also a 20\nminute cold shower or 20 minute cold\nplunge I know people do it but it's\nprobably not a good idea no probably not\nit's gonna exhaust yourselves and make\nthem age too fast fast so exactly that's\nwhen you pass that hermetic stress the\nhealthy stress level that's what is\nhappening the quite opposite is almost\nchronic stress actually in the cells\nwell what happened then was that um I\nfound out if if I want to have this\nprotocol get through ethical committee I\nI really needed to go like very like\nSleek with the not too long and and make\nsure that they were also very healthy\nand and to get approval of course of\nthis study\num but what I did was to to recruit\nwinter swimmers who already have been\nswimming for two or three seasons and I\njust observed them I said I'm not gonna\ndo an intervention study yet I did that\nafter but I I wanted to do like a proof\nof concept where they were already\nadapted to the cold and then compare\nthem to a match control group who were\nmatched on\num on you could say diet so whether they\nvegetarian or not\num and one of them worse in each group\nuh also they weren't all vegetarians no\nno no just one in each group yeah it's\ngonna say with all the amazing fish and\nmeat in uh in Denmark I'd have a hard\ntime being a vegetarian no the breads\nare amazing the fruits and vegetables\ntoo but okay so there were a couple\nvegetarians in each group yeah one one\nin each yeah okay and then I'm\nvegetarian I have family members of\nvegetarians so I've just poking fun yeah\nyeah but they were they were matched on\ndifferent things so what we usually\nmatch the mono is also BMI\num which shows one gender in this study\nand we would always choose both men and\nwomen normally but we do see that there\nare different Brown fat levels depending\non gender so women have more Brown fat\nthan men really yeah interesting yeah I\nthink it's interesting uh a deserved\nstudy yeah yeah why actually I think\nit's interesting because women are also\nsmaller so in size and mass right but\nthey also have\num a lower peripheral temperature\nespecially on hands and ears and is that\nright that's that's documented that what\nwomen do run colder than men yeah and\nphysiologically I didn't say\npsychologically no no no we won't we\nwon't go to the psychological\nyeah something else that's a different\npodcast yeah\nso women are just colder physically\nso on hands and ears it's measured on\nthat\num and and and feet as well so compared\nto men and men have bigger Hearts than\nwomen and they can pump out more blood\nperipheral than in a woman's body so\nthey that could be an explanation for\nthe colder hands for example\nsome comfortable state is also different\nbetween genders so men are more\ncomfortable at 22 degrees Celsius and\nwomen are thermal comfortable at 24\ndegrees Celsius and this is the\nthermostat Wars of home have been now\nvalidated\ntwo degrees Celsius by the way prior to\num starting recording uh I made the\nexecutive decision that we were going to\ngo with Celsius throughout the podcast\num because the majority of the world\nuses Celsius so for those of you that\nthink in Fahrenheit\num the internet is your friend in making\nthose conversions so we're sticking with\nCelsius so men tend to be Thermo\ncomfortable at 22 degrees Celsius women\nat 24. okay interesting explains a lot\nabout like also some arguments in the\nhomes where men are turning down the\nheater and women are turning up the\nheater and they cannot really so it's\nit's really it's I'm on both sides here\nI understand the men we understand the\nwomen but it's there is a difference\nthere which was also one of the reasons\nwhy we had we in this proof of concept\nstudy chose one gender so it is not like\nonly because we wanted to study man it\nwas just to see to eliminate uh all the\nconfounding factors which could have an\nimpact on on our results so\num that was one of the reasons\num but also because we yeah so women\nhave have more Brown fat than men and\notherwise we would have to like do four\ngroups or something like that and not\nhaving funding yet we were like okay we\nneed to do like just one a group just a\ncontrol group and then and a group who\nwill always winter swimmers so I\nrecruited winter swimmers who have been\nswimming for two to three seasons\num because I wanted them to be already\nadapted but not going too long in the\nwater so they told me I did a lot of\nscreening here of course beforehand and\ninterviews to see to ask them how much\ndo you do and\num how much do you how long do you stay\nin the water and I monitored how long\ndid they didn't stay in the water and\nrecruited based on\num that they only did like two to three\ntimes per week it seems reasonable for\nfor Denmark at least to do that and they\nstayed only in the water for one to two\nminutes so the coastal subsides very\nquickly and you will get this activation\nof your rest and digest system which is\nyour parasympathetic nervous system so\nthe the other branch of your other\nenormous nervous system and you get that\nactivation because you submerged into\ncold water and when you do that you have\nan activation of your diving response\nand that's gonna slow down the you can\nsay the the cons Assumption of oxygen\nalso in your body and that's going to\nslow down your heart rate could I pause\nyou on this because I've heard this\nbefore that when we get into cold water\nshower or immersion we get this\nsympathetic autonomic response so\nincreased blood pressure increased heart\nrate release of norepinephrine from the\nlocus ceruleus in the brain release of\num adrenaline dopamine adrenaline from\nthe from the adrenals\ndopamine presumably within the brain\nbut that the parasympathetic response is\nactivated when we put our face into cold\nwater or go underwater and that's a\ncalming relaxation response\nso this brings us back to I don't want\nto take us off track from you describing\nthe study but this brings us back to the\nfirst question which is if I go\ncompletely underwater for a moment when\nI start my cold plunge does that change\nthe physiological outcome as compared to\nif I just submerge myself up to the neck\nand that and actually nowadays there's\nit seems to be a little bit of a\nmovement online of people putting a bowl\nof ice water on their countertop and\nsubmerging their face into it did you\nsee this this is a start obviously more\nand more posts about this so um could\nyou just touch on the what the dive\nreflex is and why it act perhaps\nactivates the parasympathetic response\nthis calming response\nbut also the diving reflex is activated\nwhen you submerge into cool water\num even just to the neck yeah or I\nthought you had to get your face under\nI'm not I'm not arguing different you're\nthe expert I just wanna yeah I haven't\nreally I haven't read that I've just\nseen that you can activate your uh that\ndiving response as soon as you go\nunderwater with your body\num so you don't have to do it with your\nface as far as I understand I could I\ncould be wrong though\num yeah so when when you activate your\ndiving response you will slow down your\num your oxygen consumption in your body\nand that is because the body tries to\npreserve\num oxygen so you will not get\nhypothermic too fast so it's kind of\nlike a survival system in your body\num so this survival system is very\num important for us of course so that\nwould be activated and because of that\nyou will have to maybe one minute or so\nI'm that can be precise on that because\nI maybe it also varies a bit in humans\nso one to two minutes you will have full\nactivation of the sympathetic nervous\nsystem but also the parasympathetic\nnervous system\num and that's going to activate for\nexample something like serotonin in your\nbrain which is like also good for mental\nbalance and people feeling in mental\nbalance afterwards they after they go up\nyou know so that is like measured on a\nquestionnaires and also measure like on\nanecdotes of course people tell all the\ntime that they feel good afterwards we\nneed studies on this so if anyone's\nsitting out there thinking that's\ninteresting then please do some studies\non that to get more out of that yeah\nso you had so you observed these winter\nswimmers who are done this for a few\nseasons yeah they're coming around for a\nnew season of winter swimming and you've\ndecided to recruit them as subjects\nthey are getting into cold water\num climbing down a ladder or jumping\ninto the water up to their neck yeah\nclimbing yeah okay climbing down a\nladder into it because it's done\nOutdoors what a fun study to do my\ngraduate thesis was done under\nfluorescent lights with no windows in a\nin a building that uh I mean I had a ton\nof fun as a PhD student I actually lived\nin the laboratory as a PhD student I\nloved it so much but um not something\nrequired to do a PhD by the way but um\nthey're climbing down the ladder yeah\ngetting it up to their neck staying in\nfor one to two minutes\nand then getting out and how many times\na week are they doing this so to do this\ntwo to three times per week and for each\ntime they go each day they go they take\nthree rounds off so three dips and two\nsauna sessions so they start in the cold\nand they end in the cold water okay so\nit's get in for one to two minutes then\nget out and get into the sauna yeah\num what is the temperature of the sauna\nabout 80 degrees Celsius okay then how\nlong are they in the sauna so they\nstayed there for 10 to 15 minutes so\ndepending on if they went two times per\nweek or three times per week okay and\nthen they get back into the cold for a\nfew minutes two minutes up to two\nminutes yeah okay then back into the\nsauna 15 minutes or so yeah then back\ninto the cold for a third round yeah\nback into the sauna\nand then then they're ending and then\nback into the cold again and then ending\non cold yeah and uh and we'll talk about\nwhy it's important to end on cold the\nso-called sober principle\num how cold was the water in this\nparticular given average because I\nrealized it's outdoor winter swimming so\nit's going to vary depending on wind\nchill and things as well of course so\nit's a very uncontrolled environment to\ndo this kind of study then but I wanted\nto do something that was also very close\nto something people could do for free\ngoing out in nature and use that and\nalso have the nature like it's very\nhealthy impact on us it lowers our\nstress stress level as well so\nby doing so I also measured the\ntemperature every time they went so I\nhave this graph and it's actually in the\nwinter swimming book it shows the\ntemperature in Denmark going like from\nOctober to April and it's like it starts\nat 12 degrees I think it's around 12 to\n12 degrees Celsius and the water and\nthen it goes down to two degrees in on\naverage in January and then up again\num so it's within the spectrum of very\ncold water I would say from around 15 15\ndegrees Celsius and down but it was\nactually not colder than like two to\nfour degrees in in on average when it\nwas the coldest so it doesn't have to be\nthat cold to be good enough and and\nenough to activate our metabolism\num and what time of day are\num the participants doing this cold\nsauna alternation so I think they did\nthis uh throughout the day so I didn't\ncontrol whether they wanted to go in the\nmorning in the afternoon or in the\nevening at that time where I set up this\nstudy I would I was not controlling it\nin that way I wanted them to go whenever\nthey had time and I also think that is\nthe most important message to give to\ngive to people is to do it when you have\ntime it's not if if doing it when you\nget home from work and it's six o'clock\nin the evening and this is the time\nwhere you are where you can do it and\nthen then try out if it's going to\nimpact your sleep or not if it doesn't\nimpact your sleep then fine but you have\nto try for yourself and find out what\nworks for you it's the same for coffee\nfor example right some people can drink\ncoffee in the evening and go to bed and\nthey can sleep I can't or exercise or\nexercise exactly so I can't I can't do\nthat and that's because the coffee\nexercise cold water and immersion is\ngoing to activate your sympathetic\nnervous system you haven't increase in\nstress response in your body and and\nthat's going to make it really hard to\nfall asleep for some people at least\nmaybe you are super exhausted anyways\nand then you will just crash anyways but\nyeah but um that's that's the only thing\nso I just told them to do this if they\ncan during the daytime\num and that's primarily what they also\ndid and then uh all along you're\nmeasuring Brown fat by way of this\ninfrared uh camera right\num so what did you observe in terms of\nchanges in brown how quickly did that\noccur and um and then I'd like to ask\nalso about sauna a bit more because\nearlier you mentioned that you can\nactivate round fat with sauna as well\nwith heat surface of the skin\num\nhow long did it take before you observed\nsignificant increases in brown fat and\nwas it increased density of my brown fat\nor distribution was it you know showing\nexpansion to different regions\nthroughout the body and maybe you could\nalso touch on some of the changes in\ninsulin sensitivity and Metabolism yeah\na very good question and and I didn't\nmention this before but besides\nmeasuring\num temperature as an outcome for brown\nfat activity we also did pet MRI\nscanning of the brown fat so this is\nlike the the golden standard for\nmeasuring Brown fat and it's not very\nfeasible for normal people to get an and\na pet a CT or pet MRI a scanning of the\nbrown fat is super expensive\num so we had both uh to see if we could\nhave like a continuous measure of brown\nfat in humans because that was already\nnot not out there so I wanted to see\nduring both the experience governmental\ndays but also during day and night what\nkind of like circadian rhythm do we have\nin our Brown fat activity so that's why\nI wanted to have that as well so the Pet\nCity scanning or the pit MRI scanning\nwas to see upon code activation\num stimulation for some hours do we have\nactivation can we see the brown fat in\nthis subject and also during Thermo\nneutrality or thermal comfortable State\nhow is that activated in each of the\ngroup of course ah so you want to see\nhow comfortable people were away from\nthe cold water and sauna just had\ndifferent temperature environments is\nthat right yeah so I also measured that\nhow comfortable are you I had I made\nthis scale like visual analog scale and\nasked them how comfortable do you feel\nwith this temperature and throughout the\nstudy days during cold exposure and\nthermal comfortable day that had a whole\nday where I just kept them Thermal\ncomfortable to see do they activate the\nbrown fat if they're just completely\nthermal comfortable as good as we could\nget with that because you were asking\npeople\num on a scale from one to ten and five\nbeing thermal comfortable where are you\non the scale so one would be very cold\nand ten would be super burning hot\num yeah and so that was the way to like\ntry to figure out how do they actually\nfeel also during their studies they also\nmeasured a Electro myography so of of\nmuscles to see do they shiver during the\ncooling day and sometimes people shiver\nbefore they know they're really\nshivering so I had interesting yeah so\nour conscious perception of shivering\nmight not be the best readout of shiver\nyeah well you if you also get adapted to\nthe cold water you will have a less\nshivering there will be less vigorous\nthey will be very small so you wouldn't\nprobably know that you are shivering\nbecause this shivering is so small and\nthe mitochondria in the muscle cells\nwill be so dense that it doesn't need to\nshiver maybe that much to get a dead\nthermogenesis going and compared to when\nyou're completely new\nuh to code water exposure you're not\nadapted then the body needs to create\nthese mitochondria these energy Fabrics\nto keep you warm and that's also what\nthe exercise is in the beginning but\num when we measured this we did see that\nthe winter swimmers were shivering less\nor having less vigorous shivering when\nthey said I'm cold so even though they\nthey perception their perception of the\ncup was pretty similar in in the in the\ngroups and we could see that the the\nactivation of the the muscles that we\nmeasured on\num were different and more pictures in\nthe control group were the subjects\nincentivized to be in the study were\nthey paid or anything of that sort of\nthey just happen to like doing uh cold\nand sauna and so that's why they did the\nstudy\num well they got paid a little bit for\nit but not much and um that's how we do\nthis sure I was just curious yeah yeah I\nwas just curious there might be some\nfolks that Wonder so so what did you\ndiscover in terms of changes in brown\nfat insulin resistance or insulin\nsensitivity rather and um metabolism so\nwhat we we saw was we had this kind of\ndifferent measures to see what to try\nand unreal what what's actually going on\nwhen they are already adapted to the\ncold water compared to a control group\nwho was matched on on various parameters\nwe we did see that the winter swimmers\nhad an increased insulin sensitivity\nthey produced less insulin on all the\nexperimental days so besides from just\ncooling them and measuring the brown fat\non each of these cooling days or two\ncooling days and one thermal comfortable\nday right so I wanted to measure insulin\nwhen I just they were fasting meaning\nthat they hadn't eaten in eight hours\nbefore the study day\num and they were completely laying still\nnot moving just in a bit and we measured\ninsulin during the experimental day just\nto see how what level are they on and we\ncould see that the the winter swimmer\nhad lower production of insulin and they\nalso when they had an glucose drink so\nwe give them that to see if they to test\nbefore we enroll them in studies to see\nif they have diabetes for example and\nnot knowing for example that that\nwouldn't that would like ruin maybe the\nstudy so we test for that and see if\nthey have like a normal curve so what\nwas this seeing that was that the winter\nswimmers had a faster glucose clearance\nin the bloodstream so after two hours we\ncould see that they had a lower level\nand it went the curve went down faster\nthan in the control group so despite\nhaving lower insulin release they have\nbetter blood glucose clearance which is\nreally what you want what we all seek\nright you know excessive insulin is bad\ninsulin being a um more or less a\nchaperone for blood glucose\num can do all sorts of other things as\nwell of course but\num and having high blood glucose\nobviously terrible yeah for cells\nespecially brain cells I don't think\npeople realize how toxic high blood\nglucose is having high glucose if you\nwant to kill neurons you make you make\ntheir uh put them in an environment\nwhere there's too much sugar\num oh yeah very yeah very neurotoxic I\nmean that's and their mechanisms like\ninsulin that buffer that we keep you\nknow keeping blood glucose in a\nreasonable range so that\num that doesn't happen I mean I think\nthat's why people will go into\ninsulinemic shock\num hypoglycemic shock is also possible\nso that range in which neurons are happy\nis not a it's not a tremendously large\nrange incidentally the range in which\nneurons are are\num happy in surviving uh is much greater\nas one gets colder than when you heat up\nI mean you can basically destroy brain\ncells by getting too hot for too long oh\nyeah yeah you can definitely destroy\nbrain cells permanently by getting too\ncold for too long but you have to get\nreally really cold for a really long\ntime yeah yeah um very interesting yeah\nwe're thinking about doing uh an episode\non um uh sort of survival of the brain\nafter death kind of things which\nactually happens you hear about these\npeople who are declared dead and then\ncome back and there's actually now a lot\nof crowd preservation type approaches\nfor that this is uh anyway we risk going\ninto the the uh the esoteric now so I'll\nsteer us back to our discussion about\nyour study but\num so if I do the math\nthese subjects are in the cold let's say\nthey're doing three rounds of cold for\none to two minutes three to two or three\ntimes a week\nwhat were the thresholds that you\ndiscovered were important for getting\nthese positive changes in um\nsuch as reduced blood sugar or clearance\nof blood sugar\num being more efficient uh reduced\ninsulin improved Brown fat distribution\nand density\num how much cold exposure do people need\nhow much heat exposure do people need in\norder to extract these benefits yeah so\nwhen we then calculated the numbers\ntogether we could see that this was\nended up being 11 minutes in total per\nweek so not in one session of course but\nthey had two to three visits to the\nwater and the sauna per week so when we\ndivide that out it corresponds to being\nin cold water one to two minutes at a\ntime but also in the sauna 10 to 15\nminutes at a time and I think this is\nvery like also similar to what we see in\nother studies when we look for example\nto the observational studies from The\nFinnish cohort study from laauken at L\nfor example they published this very\namazing paper in 2015 and some results\nfrom this long cohort study where they\nshow that that up to 30 minutes in the\nsauna was healthy and they you you lower\nyour risk of cardiovascular disease and\nthat's like the threshold and if you go\nfurther than that then there is not more\nhealthy benefits to to gain from that so\nand before that it's like 19 minutes\nthen you will have this dose response\nrelationship up to 19 minutes that's\nreally in decreasing your risk of\ncardiovascular diseases and I think\nthat's per week 90 minutes per week 90\nminutes per session now recession yeah\nper session if we\num\nthen compare that with my study which\nwas 10 to 15 minutes per session then I\nthink it fits very well with what we\ncall the Hermetic stress or healthy\nstress that you expose the cells to this\nkind of like potent very stressful\nsituation where they increase heat shock\nproteins in the cells and that will\nrepair the cells but if you then overdo\nit and you go beyond the maybe 30\nminutes in the sauna this observational\nstudy from Finland with more than up to\n2 000 sauna bathers where they have full\nof these for 20 years they see that a 30\nminutes position is like enough and if\nyou go above that you don't get more\nhealth benefits out of it so I think\nthere's a window where we can say the\nhealthy stress corresponds to like 10\nminutes and I think it's per session per\nsession and it's not it's not much\nactually so you don't need to\nit shows that you don't have to expose\nyourself very much to the Heat or very\nmuch actually to the cold to get this\nhealthy benefits from going into cold\ngoing to heat and have healthy benefits\non your cardiovascular system so I think\nthis is very important also a message to\nto to get out that you don't have to go\nextreme you don't have to swim for a\nhalf an hour in the cold water you can\ngo in the water for one to two minutes\nand per session but go up to 11 minutes\nper week in total and for the sauna my\nstudy showed uh 57 minutes in total two\nweeks and if we also then divide it out\non these two to three days and two\nsessions each day correspond to 10 to 15\nminutes so it's a low threshold but I\nthink it's it's good to have that to\nmaybe we can aim for that if people need\nto have something to to aim for and I\nthink and I think it's really good to\nhave that because then you you don't\nhave then you don't overdo it and if you\noverdo it you exhaust the cells and that\nwill increase your risk of\ncardiovascular disease also so well I\nget a lot of questions about this and I\ndid solicit for questions for this\npodcast on on Twitter and one of the\nquestions that I got was as one becomes\nmore cold adapted do the benefits start\nto wear off or can people do too much\ncold exposure of course the answer to\nthat is yes you can become hypothermic\nbut I'm sensing a different answer now\nwhich is if I understand correctly the\nthreshold is 11 minutes total per week\nof deliberate cold exposure divided into\ntwo or three sessions of maybe one to\nthree minutes depending on how long\nsomebody stays in and then 57 minutes I\nwant to be careful not to round up um to\nan hour but divided into maybe three\n20-minute sessions or so you know um so\none doesn't have to be perfect as long\nas you get a beyond that threshold but I\nI wonder something which is\nit the case that if somebody said oh you\nknow I'm just going to do one 11 minute\nsession per week that might actually not\nbe as beneficial as dividing it up\nbecause what you told us earlier is that\nthe Hermetic response depends on having\nthat cold shock you actually don't want\nto become too cold adapted I mean once\nthe blood pressure response drops down\nso in minute four five and six yeah\nyou're getting very cold and you're\nshivering but you're one is not getting\nthe autonomic stimulus that they want I\nguess I could liken this to um if\nexercise worked in a way where it was\nonly the first few minutes of exercise\nthat really triggered the adaptation of\ncourse this is not how it works but um\nin fact probably quite the opposite\num but if that were the case then it's\nnot simply the total amount of exercise\nbut dividing up the the the sessions\ninto little bouts where every single\ntime it acts as a stimulus that seems to\nbe the key here\num this is very important\num because having watched the landscape\nof this on social media but also in\nbooks and generally\num I think you're the first person to\nreally touch on this that the goal is\nnot to get so cold adapted that you can\nsit in for the full 11 minutes in one\nsession where the goal isn't to be able\nto do an hour of very hot sauna if you\nwant to I suppose people could do it for\nother reasons but if the goal is to\nimprove these Health metrics yeah then\nthe idea is to keep the stimulus a\nstimulus short exactly yeah great well\nthis also I think there's practical\nfeasibility as you pointed out because\ngetting into a cold shower or cold\nimmersion or natural body water for a\ncouple of minutes is far less uh\num you know challenging to most people\nthan finding a full morning to go you\nknow spend there\num but I've never really heard it\narticulated that the longer sessions\nmight not be beneficial it might\nactually be detrimental\num\nthat's very important uh were there any\nother observations that you made\num that did not make it into the paper\nor that were kind of in the the margin\nnotes I mean in terms of psychological\nbenefits\num or anything of that sort there was\nthis recent study on soldiers that\ntalked about weight loss it's sort of a\ncontroversial study for a lot of reasons\num but one of the things they remarked\nin the paper was that there were a lot\nof psychological changes improved\nbuffering against anxiety\num they even the men and women in that\nstudy reported one of the significant\neffects was um significantly improved\nsexual satisfaction of course they\ndidn't tell us what that meant for these\nsubjects but so we won't go there but\nbut a number of subjective improvements\nwas there anything that you observed or\ntook note of in in your study that\nperhaps didn't make the main abstract\nbut that we should be aware of uh\nyeah there was some um and I'm I'm today\nI regret that I didn't measure on sleep\nfor example I I frankly didn't really\nthink about that when I I when I\ndesigned the study\num so we were very\num much occupied with the metabolism and\nkind of had the thought maybe this could\nimpact a Sleep Quality\num and I wish I just if I had the\nthought that why don't you just ask them\nin a questionnaire but I asked them\nevery morning or everyone who's not many\nMonies to just two mornings actually and\nwe measured on\num but the winter swimmers\num\ntold us before I wrote them that they\nhad a really good sleep quality the\ncontrol group also had that but they\ntold me on the day where we measured the\nbrown fat on a day and night so if\nactually two days and two nights and\nthey told me that they didn't they had a\ngood night's sleep but they also woke up\nso it's just telling me that they also\nhad like a quick wake up and then they\nfell asleep again\num and the winter swimmers is so they\nhave a really good sleep so it's like\nand in general they also say we we sleep\nvery well I sleep very well so it's\nanecdotally General it corresponds to\nwhat I heard in my study but nothing\nthat I measured on\num which would could be fun to do in the\nfuture but we didn't measure on Sleep\nQuality that would have been a really\ngood idea to do they also told me that\nthey were very comfortable when they\nwere cold they they don't mind a winter\nswimmers they don't mind going out for\nexample\num in in the code with a t-shirt they\nwere also less scared of showing their\nskin that was also one observation\ninteresting yeah so kind of a reduced\nsocial anxiety yeah they were just so\ncomfortable in the lab you as you just\nmentioned before coats on and\neverybody's journeying around us very\nbusy and and all the other scientists\nout in the hallway and also my\nsupervisor I had her office down down\nthe hallway and and one of the winter\nswimmers one day it just got out of bed\nafter I had been in the study for eight\nhours we it was a long day right he\njumped out of the bed and had his\nclothes in the bathroom and he went out\ncompletely naked he didn't care he just\nwent out it was like so that's a side\neffect perhaps of getting too\ncomfortable with the cold\num and we're not recommending that\nalthough in your book you\num did a uh you dedicated some let me\nstart that again although in your book\nyou dedicated some uh pages to\num naked winter swimming or I should say\nnaked cold water exposure as opposed to\num uh with bathing suit yeah are there\nany data on this I'm sorry chuckling but\num I think in most places in the United\nStates it's uh skinny dipping is not um\nis not legal most public beaches there\nare a few in fact where my laboratory\nbefore moving to Stanford was in San\nDiego and I at the Salk Institute for\nbiological studies beautiful building\nincredible Sciences done there the beach\nright below that is called Black's Beach\nokay and um and it's a known nude beach\num and so whenever tourists were heading\ndown the stairway there\num I would you know sort of let them\nknow especially if they had kids I'd let\nthem know you know and it's a nude beach\nof a particular\num uh of a particular genre so I I'd\ngive them a little warning about what\nwhat they could expect down below it's a\num in any event those beaches are quite\nrare\num in the United States maybe compared\nto Europe I don't know\num but yeah maybe yeah so is there\nanything special about\num clothes lists versus closed um\nexposure yeah I think in that sense we\nhave a bit more free with this kind of\nlike but but remember we also had this\nwinter swimming culture for so for\nhundreds of years in Denmark and the\nwind said the oldest winter swimming\nclubs that we have especially the one we\nhave in Copenhagen where I did my next\nstudy which we haven't talked about but\nand it's also not published yet but\num in that winter swimming club it's the\noldest one we have and it's huge and\nthey they swim naked at this facility\nmen and women men and women and they\nhave sauna where they can go in together\nand they also have the separate saunas\nbut it's very much a Danish thing and\nand I think it's I think it's I think\nit's good if people want that\num and I had it in my book because\npeople want to know if they have to swim\nwith their bathing suit on or if they\ncan take it off or what's the what's the\ndifference is there any difference in\nthis and if you ask me there is no\ndifference oh if you have your little\nskinny bikini on it's not going to do\nany difference to your cold exposure or\nyour adaptation it's not going to do any\ndifference for your benefits of course\nbut I think that it has something else\nit has something to do with how you also\nobserve yourself how you absorb your\nsurroundings and it's sometimes some\nsense of freedom in skinny dipping so I\nthink people in Denmark who does this is\nthey do the winter swimming because they\nfeel free when they do they come home\nfrom work they go to this club and they\nskinny dip and they feel like in touch\nwith nature and they have maybe done\nthis their whole life so this is an old\ntradition in Denmark in some of the\nclubs\num but the newer clubs are coming they\ndon't they don't do skinny diff so\neveryone has bathing suit I never Skinny\nDip because there are people around\npeople with phones and taking pictures\nall the time so this is different\ndifferent nowadays everything's recorded\nyeah yeah and also this this old\ntradition is also fading away because of\nthat yeah I um I use sauna and cold at\nhome but when I travel there there's a\nBanya so Russian Banya has hot sauna and\ncold plunge um there's one in San\nFrancisco called Archimedes Banya\num and that one is clothing optional so\nsome people are clothed such as myself\nand then other people are not and it's\nco-ed\nmost of the time I think they have male\nfemale separated uh evenings or\nsomething like that and then\num the other Banya is Spa 88 which is in\non Wall Street in New York is an amazing\nBanya as well and these are starting to\ncrop up in different cities or maybe\nthey've been there for a long time and\nhas deliberate cold exposure and sauna\ngets more popular more people are using\nthem the the one in New York that I that\nSpa 88 is always closed\num and it's interesting because you know\npeople hear naked or skinny dipping and\nthey they might get certain ideas in\nmind it\num yeah all these places are very well\nlit and they all have a tone of kind of\num of Health that it's about the kind of\nhealth and and wellness\num I guess the point being that\num there's no requirement uh to do one\nthing or the other although in the\nstudies that uh you did obviously um\npeople were clothed but I I did um\nI did pay attention to those pages in\nyour book I thought it was interesting\nthat you put some um some dedicated uh\npassages in your book related to this\nand I think my publisher wanted that\nyeah it was not me it was like my\npublisher really wanted to have a little\ndiscussion about that so I was like okay\nwell I think it you know it points to a\nlarger theme which is I think for a lot\nof people who already do these practices\num there's no shock there yeah um for\npeople that do not do deliberate cold\nexposure or sauna I think that\num you know there is this idea perhaps\nthat oh you know these are\num Traditions that are are kind of\nFringe or that they're kind of and I\njust I want to um cue that point because\nthere's so many things that are\nhappening right now in biomedical\nresearch and Medicine you know serious\nquality peer-reviewed studies published\nin excellent journals like your paper on\nthings like deliberate cold exposure\nsauna\num the use of particular supplements\nnatural natural herbs and supplements I\nmean there's an entire brain answer the\nNational Institutes of Health in the\nUnited States dedicated just to the\nstudy of supplements and behavioral\ninterventions for health like meditation\nand breath work really incredible it's\nreally incredible and psychedelics of\ncourse being something that for a long\ntime was part of a certain community and\nfeel and now is being um frankly adopted\nby mainstream medicine even Pharma so it\nthe the times are changing\num and so uh yes I think it's important\nto know that um it's perfectly\nacceptable and encouraged to wear\nclothing absolutely absolutely yeah\nyeah and one other thing that I wanted\nto to mention going back to your\nquestions around with there were any\nobservations in the studies which would\nreally maybe haven't discussed yet and\nmaybe it's in in the back of the the\npaper and not mentioned that much was\none of the winter swimmers didn't have\nany brown fat when we measured him zero\nzero and uh in we do see this um in in\nin previous studies as well that some\nhumans don't have any brown fat was he\ndid he carry a lot of white fat adipose\ntissue was he was he obese no he wasn't\nno he was not obese because that he\nwould not have been in the study then oh\nright yes you mentioned this earlier\nforgive me no no it's fine but he was um\nbut what I did observe before I knew\nthat he didn't have any problem for us\nthat during the cooling experiment where\nI cooled them for uh two hours before\nthey go into the Pet City scanner\nhe\nwas not able to control his shivering\nlike the winter swimmers they could\nso he got he got very cold very easily\nuh compared to the others so and without\nI didn't know what was different about\nhim but we could all or me and the three\nothers were working on the experiment we\nwere like okay what's going on because\nwe turned down the the temperature but\nhe started like shivering and then we\nhad to turn it up again and it was just\nall over the place the temperature is\nnot it wasn't that controlled like the\nothers it was pretty similar protocol I\ncould just do pretty much the same\nbecause they were same size and they\nalso same gender so it it was easier to\nlike foresee what was going to happen\nand when will they start Shiver I\nquickly learned that but with this\nsubject it was just with this volunteer\nwas just very much different and then\nwhen we scanned him and didn't find any\nproblem I I I didn't even think about it\nso when we scanned him we didn't see\nanything I told the Pet City people to\nlike oh you put up the wrong uh scanning\nexplain the technology yeah the\ntechnology it was like this scanning\nlooked like the thermal neutral day the\nthermal comfortable day where we also\nscanned them to see if they have any\nbrown fat so you have made a mistake I\nwas pretty sure and the re-analysis and\nanalyzed this um\nscanning and they just concluded well it\nthe scanning was fine the experiment\nwent well it was just that he didn't\nhave any brown fat so he was like but we\njust in the paper called a brown fat\nnegative so he didn't have any and in in\nmy studies it would be called a knockout\nso it didn't have any brown fan so what\nthe observation with him and I think\nthat would be that's interesting is that\nhe both\nshivered very early on and didn't\nregulate his temperature as well he also\ntold me that then he was like F5 on the\nscale of how comfortable he felt with\nthe cold\num\nso it was from one to ten and five being\nthermal comfortable and 10 being very\ncold and and one very hard so on this\nlike scale up and up and down\nand he he was like more up and down on\nthis scale than any of the others it was\nan observation that I did\num\nwhat we did see in his blood samples\nalso that his blood samples looked a bit\nmore like the control group\num also his insulin levels were like the\ncontrol group so a little bit higher\nthan the other winter swimmers and he\nalso had\num\nhis blood glucose clearance was not as\nfast as\num as the the other winter swimmers so\nhe was like an outlier what we call it\nan in the analysis we also had to take\nhim out of the analysis because he was\nan outlier\num so the results showing that the brown\nfat\nis a more efficiently activated in the\nwinter swimmers is without him having\nhim in that group but it didn't ruin the\nstudy if we I tried to put him in as\nwell and didn't it didn't ruin the\nresults or anything but just to to keep\nit more clear we put we took him out of\nthe analysis yeah so he was a mutant a\nknockout yeah and I'm sure they're out\nthere um very interesting so if you\nshiver early\num then perhaps you have less brown fat\nto begin with although it's hard to\nconclude from one person that's sort of\nthe the the implication there oh you\nhaven't adapted to the code so you\nshould build that up yeah right so in\naddition to looking at regulation of\nblood sugar\nBrown fat\nmetabolism and so on were there any\nmarkers that you examined in the\ndeliberate cold exposure group as\ncompared to controls that reveal to you\nthat deliberate cold exposure could have\nadditional benefits\num say for uh immune system function or\nfor any function for that matter\nbefore we looked at inflammation of\ncourse we measure of the outcome of\nblood pressure and so on but we also\nmeasured the il-6 in the study just to\nsee also an inflammatory\nanti-inflammatory marker so il-6 went up\nand it also follows with the il-10 so\nthat is like also very known in the\nliterature so we measured that and I\nthink it's very important to to think\nabout the code exposure the heat\nexposure as something that then lowers\nthe inflammation in the body and if we\ncan do that we will have an open door\nfor\num a preventing lifestyle diseases right\nso for\num type 2 diabetes but actually also for\nsome mental diseases as well so as known\nas depression and anxiety and also\nAlzheimer's disease which are all\nassociated in research also newer\nresearch showing that a that\ninflammation increases the risk of\ndepression anxiety and Alzheimer's\nneurological diseases so if we can\ndecrease inflammation in the body we\nwill decrease our modern lifestyle\ndiseases but also these increasing\nmental diseases that we see in these\nmodern lifestyle times\num so I think that\nit's I think it's very interesting that\nwe can go out in nature and we can use\nthese natural stressors and it I don't\nwant to have it sound very romantic or\nanything it's just it's just exposure to\ntemperature actually just a colder to\nheat that is going to trick our body\ninto a natural state again and reset it\nwhere the the homeostasis the balance\nhas is lost a bit so the body is going\nto repair itself in that way and I think\nit's beautiful that we can do that just\nby changing the temperature of our body\nand although people are very scared of\ndoing this because in our times we have\nbeen away from cold away from Heat\ntemperature for some for decades now\num since we isolated our houses better\nand we are more sedentary we also sit\nmore indoor we don't move as much so\nthis very modern sedentary lifestyle has\nmade us more temperature comfortable\njust neutral so no no wonder I mean that\nobesity is increasing we don't expose\nourselves to the Natural stresses that\nwe did earlier on\num in in our environment but also about\nso maybe the 70s the 60s where we\nstarted having more like comfortable\nLifestyles right and obesity increases\nin the in the 80s we can see that from\nstatistics so I think that if we can\ntake in cold and heat and you mentioned\nother things also before but of course\nexercise is very important here and also\na bit of fasting actually because it all\nincreases the Hermetic stress in the\nbody so it's it doesn't have to be other\nthan natural stresses to the body which\nthen could keep us in that Natural\nBalance again could we talk about what I\nrefer to as the soberg principle which\nis to end on cold and the reason I\ncalled it the sober principle is because\num in reviewing oh by the way I wasn't a\nofficial reviewer of your paper but I\nmean in reading and um reviewing your\npaper for its after published Contents I\nnoticed that you had people end on cold\nand this has been a long-standing debate\nin the the uh deliberate cold exposure\nCommunity should you warm up with a warm\nshower afterwards or get back in the\nsauna what should you end on cold or end\non Heat and the sober principle says end\non cold as I understand it\nin order to force your body to heat\nitself back up and thereby increase\nmetabolism further still is that right\nyes so when you when you end on the cold\nyou you force your body to heat up by\nitself and that will require that you\nactivate you keep your brown fat\nactivated and also your muscles which is\na good thing it's a good collaboration\nso keep your thermogenesis up and that's\nlike an an exercise even when you go\nhome so in that way you don't have to\nthink about your cold exposure or\ndipping in in your plunge or open sea or\nwhat it is as just a an exercise that\nyou do for one to two minutes and then\nit's over if you end on the code you\nhave an exercise for your body going on\nfor hours afterwards and that's not only\non your metabolism but it's also going\nto keep your neurotransmitters activated\nas well and increase that because your\nbody is still cold so you need that\nthose neurotransmitters to activate the\nbrown fat as well so that's going to\nmake your brown fat cells more efficient\nand also your muscle cells more\nefficient so increasing mitochondria in\nthe cells which will then generate heat\nvery fast so if you have done this for a\nfew times so maybe three four five times\num\nbeing new to this but I have tried it a\nfew times you will notice a switch where\nyou like feel that you get easily warmer\nand you can keep yourself warmer and\nthat is also what was shown in in my\nstudy is that the the winter swimmers\nwere physically warmer on the skin\ncompared to the control group so they\nwhen they are out of the cold when\nthey're out of the cold just relaxing\nand we tested this in in on the days\nwhere they were sleeping in the lab so\nwe could see that they had a more\nactivation of the brown fat a higher\ntemperature so probably because they\nalso lose heat they have a high heat\nloss to the body compared to the control\ngroup\num because they have a more vascular\nskin because of the contrast or cold and\nheat so they lose heat faster from the\nbody during that day but is that a bad\nthing no probably not because that's\ngonna keep your brown fat and your\nmuscles a little bit activated so we you\nwill have to to it it has to work to\nkeep you warm I and I would hypothesize\nthat it also might lead to some of the\num subjectively reported improvements in\nsleep because in order to fall asleep\nyou need your core body temperature to\ndrop by about one to three degrees so\nit's not just sufficient to be sleeping\nin a cold room and under the blanket you\nalso need your body temperature to drop\nyes and so what you're saying if I\nunderstand correctly is that by forcing\nby ending on cold and forcing oneself to\nheat up naturally that increases the\nbrown fat stores which I sort of see as\na kind of like the oil in the candle of\nthe Furnace that is thermogenesis\nand that\nin turn leads to increased heat loss\nwhich people might think oh I don't want\nto lose heat from the body but there are\ntimes when you want to lose heat from\nthe body basically it sounds like what\nwe want is to be a very efficient\nheating and cooling system yes that it's\nnot about being cold or being hot it's\nreally about keeping the system tuned\nwell keeping the oil in the candle this\nbrown fat\num functioning yeah what could I ask one\nquestion about\num fed or fasted is there any or rather\nare there any known benefits of doing\ndeliberate cold exposure and or sauna\nfasted uh versus\num after a meal say within the last hour\nor something of that sort I do my\ndeliberate cold exposure first thing in\nthe morning\num so in general I'm fasted because I\ndon't eat until a little bit later in\nthe day yeah uh but what's known about\nthat and was that looked at in your\nstudy I know you measured glucose but\nthat was as a separate\num test away from the cold away from the\ncold yeah but I also tested glucose on\nthe days under cold so we measured that\nas well on on the cooling days\num\nspecifically on fasting and fat I don't\nknow I don't think that I've seen\nstudies specifically on this okay\num more science needed um\na number of people ask about the use of\ndeliberate cold exposure to offset some\nof the symptoms of various diseases now\nhere we're not talking about curing\ndisease we're talking about offsetting\nsymptoms\num one question I've seen quite often is\nwhether or not people with Raynaud's\nsyndrome this is a syndrome and my high\nschool girlfriend had this syndrome and\nI'll never forget uh we went we're at a\nschool dance together and um this was\nwhen we first started dating and um she\nhad Ray nodes which leads to very poor\nblood flow to the the uh the extremities\nand\num and she was very cold so she left to\ngo to the bathroom and warm up her hands\nin the warm water and I was left\nstanding there at the dance and people\ncame up to me and asked you know why I\nwas there and who I was there with and I\nkept telling them who I was with and\nthey didn't believe me because they\ncouldn't believe that she would be with\nme made total sense if you knew me at\nthe time\num I was I I was way out of my league\nwith her um at the time I like to think\neventually I caught up but in any case\num she was in the bathroom for about an\nhour so at one point I did consider the\npossibility that she had just left but\nindeed she hadn't she warmed her hands\nback up but people with Ray nodes suffer\nfrom this\num from this thing a very very cold\nextremities\num their fingertips will even turn blue\num you know as if they were starting to\nget frostbitten it's quite dramatic\num and that question gets asked whether\nor not there's any use of cold to try\nand increase the um elasticity the\nplasticity of the of the small\ncapillaries and vessels by everything\nyou've described up until now it seems\nlike that would be a logical thing to do\num and in addition to that whether or\nnot people with autoimmune conditions\npeople with\num any other types of conditions are\nknown to benefit from deliberate cold\nexposure I'm not aware of any studies\nbut I get asked about this a lot and\nthere were a lot of questions about this\nfor you in the Twitter feed yeah I think\n[Music]\nI haven't seen any studies directed on\nthis outcome and measuring rhinoids\nsyndrome\num I do know that it's it's uh it's not\nthat rare actually a problem and I know\nthat many women or more women than men\nsuffer from this\num but logically it would help them if\nthey expose their hands to cold and also\nheat to make the vest it more vascular\nbut\nand I have heard from people saying that\nit had helped them but also heard for\nsome others saying it didn't help them\nso studies are needed on this specific\ntopic I think\nI hurt my hands when I go into the cover\nand I don't have this syndrome at all\nbut I keep my hands above the water you\ndo yeah and I do that um often I take a\nlittle bit of a swim and then of course\nI have to have my hands in the water but\nit helps me when I then get back to the\ndaddy and then take my hands up because\nthen I can stand there for a little bit\nand get my one to two minutes exposure\nand then I can go up because then\notherwise that would stop me from being\nin the water enough time that I as long\nas I I would like to so if people suffer\nfrom having this pain in the fingers and\nit can be very intense so just take the\nhands up a bit from the water and and\nthat's gonna help you also boots\nneoprene boots it's going to help on the\nfeet some people have the hurt and feel\nthe pain in the feet and on the ankles\nand that's going to help them also a\nlittle bit okay so there is no problem\nwith keeping hands out or feet in uh\nneoprene booties if people feel the need\nto do that if that's what the if pain of\nthe hands or feet is a barrier for\npeople doing uh cold exposure then it\nseems it would be okay to do to keep\nhands out or to keep your feet Yes\nbecause then you you do get the exposure\nuh but of course hands and feet are very\npotent places in your body to get a fast\nactivation of your nervous system of\ncourse but if you can just you can also\njust dip them and then take them up it's\ngonna still gonna activate that but you\nhave your full body is covered in in the\nco-preceptors you'll have a full\nactivation anyways so you are providing\nvery reassuring information to people\nbecause I know a number of people that\ndo not like to put their hands in I find\nthat the more of my body I get in the\nmore comfortable I am it's like I don't\nknow if it's psychologically and or\nphysiologically I find that if where\nthere's an interface between the water\nand the cold it's most uncomfortable so\nI prefer to just get everything under I\nkeep my head out although I these days\nI've been dunking all the way in and\nthen coming out and then dunking once\nmore with my head under before I get out\nafter the the plunge\num that raises a different question now\nwe're getting into kind of the\npracticalities of deliberate cold\nexposure which I think are important\num sometimes I'll experience and I hear\nfrom a lot of people that they'll get a\nkind of back of the head headache at the\ninterface of the of the water\num you know when they're in doing cold\nimmersion to the neck\num okay I assume this has to do with\nblood flow that there's vasoconstriction\nright up until the neck and in the\nregion surrounding it but that maybe\nthere's still blood flow to the head but\ndo we know what the origin of these um\nheadaches is and again this doesn't\nhappen for everybody but some people do\nexperience them okay yeah I haven't\nreally heard about that one specifically\num so but I would say that there are\ndifferent reasons for maybe keeping your\nhead out of the water but it seems like\nmaybe for some that could be a reason\nfor like just getting like a quick head\ndunk going all the way in yeah that's\nwhat I've started doing to eliminate I\nwasn't getting headaches but I could I\nnoticed that interface okay and I wasn't\nin the rest of the experience at\nsomewhat experience of it so much so I\nstarted dunking all the way in I noticed\nin some of the photos that you've put\nout\num and in your book that you'll\nsometimes wear a cap while you go in\nyeah okay and well it comes from uh\ndifferent reasons uh so let's talk about\nsome of the physiological reasons so\nwhen you submerged in in cold water up\nto the neck and study have shown and\nthis is from Denmark studies from Peace\nhospital\num that when you submerge into cold\nwater up to the neck at zero degrees uh\nso zero degrees Celsius very cold and\nyou have a decreased blood flow to the\nbrain by around 30 to 40 percent and\nmakes sense because you activate the SIM\npathetic nervous system and and\ntherefore you will have a less blood\nflow to the brain makes you maybe a\nlittle bit dizzier and proof again that\nyou're you need a heart more than a\nbrain because when the sympathetic\nnervous system gets activated uh blood\nflow is maintained to the heart to keep\nyou alive but obviously taken away from\nthe brain to keep you from thinking\nthat's why it's hard to think when\nyou're stressed yeah well the muscles\nand then your vital organs need to you\nhave to be able to run away from that\ntiger right the rationale of its total\nsense and who am I to disagree with\nMother Nature\nwell but yeah so one of the reasons\nbeing that you should keep your head out\nof the water is that you could increase\nthat decrease in blood flow to the brain\nfurther if you dump the head so there's\njust a very nice paper from um from a a\nresearch group in Canada where they have\ncollectively looked at different papers\nwhere they compared heat loss in a group\nin the papers where they dunk the head\nand compared to heat loss uh submerging\nup to the neck to see how much extra\nheat do we lose from our core when we\ndump the head so and I think it's very\ninteresting that if you submerge up to\nthe neck you have a heat loss of 11 from\nthe body core\nand when you then also dunk the head you\nwill increase that heat loss rate by 36\npercent\nso that means I'm not saying that I'm\nnot I'm not here to say what is right\nand what is wrong I just think that\npeople should know the information so\nthey can for themselves evaluate what is\nbest for them but if you increase your\nheat loss rate by 36 from your core\nthat's going to increase your after drop\nwhich we touched upon a little bit\nearlier even further so that's meaning\nthat you are closer to hypothermia than\nyou are if you just submerge up to the\nneck so you should really think about\nwhether this is like something that you\nwant to do or if it's just better for\nyou not to get that code in your core\nthe beanie is also because I have a\nlittle bit of sensitive ears so meaning\nthat if there's wind and because we swim\nin the open sea in Denmark we have a lot\nof wind our when our conditions are just\nvery rainy very windy and when the\ntemperature is also freezing you could\nget this what is that called um so very\ncold and light-headed just from wind so\nif you also submerge into cold water and\nyou then get up you could you will get a\nbrain freeze immediately so it is enough\nto just go up to the neck wherever you\nneed to just not get dizzy also because\nthe the heat loss is increased of course\nbut also the blood flow to the brain has\ndecreased so the beanie will keep you a\nlittle bit warmer so you can stay for\none to two minutes so it's just a way of\nlike getting around some of the\nconditions also so people can choose\nthat if they they feel that but it's\nquite normal to do in in Scandinavia\nwhereabini love it and um so for those\nof you afraid of doing a two-minute cold\nshower what uh Dr Silver just described\nuh let's uh you see how um she and\nothers are capable of doing things far\nharder than that\num when the way you describe it with the\ncold wind and Scandinavia and uh\num is is quite striking along the lines\nof covering the head um there's this um\nseemingly paradoxical\nthing of people going into hot saunas\nand wearing wool caps you know if you go\nto a Banya or you I go to a sauna and\nthere are people who are\num well from Eastern Europe or typically\nor Finland or\num Russia or Ukraine or elsewhere what\nyou'll see is that many of them are\nwearing wool caps in the sauna which\nmany people think is to make it hotter\nthat's actually not the case it actually\ninsulates you from the heat environment\nthe urge the sense of urgency to get out\nof the hot sauna is a brain-driven\nmechanism and so um the reason that\npeople wear wool hats in the saunas it\nactually lets you stay in the sauna\nlonger because it takes a lot of heat to\nthe skin before you feel that you you\nhalf to get out whereas so when you\ninsulate the brain you don't get that\nsignal it's pretty interesting I've\ntried this before just by putting a\ntowel over my head in the sauna and you\ncan stay in there you know much more\neasily and for for much longer\nyou know as we talk about these\ndifferent stimuli for um the Hermetic\nresponse the adaptation of distress you\nknow it occurs to me that the the big\nones in our evolutionary history have\nbeen light\nright I mean you were talking about\nseasonal changes\num we know there especially as you go up\nto Nordic countries there are seasonal\nchanges in the amount of Light by time\nof year dramatic ones in fact less so at\nthe equator of course yeah um light\ntemperature\nfood movement and it it's sort of\ninteresting and at the same time perhaps\nit should have been obvious to us that\nthere are stimuli that our bodies have\nevolved to adapt to in very powerful\nways and so the idea that temperature\nheat and cold could evoke these\ntremendous physiological changes that\nare beneficial for us probably shouldn't\nsurprise us at all I mean I mean this is\nwhy we I mean these are not\num esoteric mechanisms they're actually\nthe the foundational mechanisms by which\nour our body and the bodies of other\nanimals adapt\num so I do have a question about the uh\ndifferent ways that people could\napproach deliberate cold exposure so for\ninstance\num\nchildren I've been to banyas where there\nare kids you know six or seven years old\nwith their parents at the Banya\num and so they're in hot sauna I'm not\nsuggesting people do this if they're if\nthey're not you know adapted to it and\nyou know talk to your parents kids and\ntalk to your kids parents um talk to\nyour doctors\num but is remarkable I mean uh children\ndoing sauna from a young age or\ndeliberate cold exposure uh are there\nany data on this and is it safe assuming\nthat you know obviously that they can\nswim and they're doing this in a tub or\nshower\num and then I'd also like to ask you\nabout are there any additional male\nfemale differences I know your study\nfocused on men but um other Studies have\nfocused on both and you of course\num are a woman and can attest to your\nown experience with this\num so children men women\num differences there in terms of\nprotocols is there anything that people\nshould build into the structure of of\ntheir deliberate cold exposure that's\nunique to that\nso yeah so this was on cold exposure so\num yeah I think that\num starting with the the question about\nchildren\num I think that it's important to\nto think about as children are smaller\nthan adults so we cannot really\ncompletely transfer all the information\nand the benefits and also protocols for\nhow long and and stuff like that two\nchildren we cannot do that because they\nare just smaller in mass and one study\nthat actually\num improves this is a study where they\nhave compared a heat loss in children\nboys who were 12 years old compared to\nadults men and looked at the heat loss\nof the cold temperature\nand expose them to a one or one or two\nminutes\num code exposure immersion up to the\nneck and what they saw was that the the\nboys in this study could actually defend\nthe core temperature in a same way as\nthe adults could but they had to use\ntheir muscles way faster so it means\nthat they couldn't stay for as long and\nthey used more energy to defend their\ncore temperature compared to the to the\nadults but for one minute it seems that\nthey could actually complain but they\nwould be colder when they then come out\nbecause they are smaller in their Mass\nto that ratio right so it means that if\nthe surface is so large on children and\ntheir mass and muscles being smaller to\nthat ratio it means that they can be in\nthe water\nless time before they get hypothermic so\njust think about that they are just\nsmaller they can't defend their\ntemperature for a very long time but in\nthis study they saw that for up to I\nthink it was a minute or so they can one\nminute yeah I'm glad you mentioned\nhypothermia and smaller bodied\num people children uh I used to do some\nPacific ocean swims in the morning\num without wetsuits and I adapted to it\npretty quickly and these are fairly long\nswims and we brought an excellent\nswimmer with us\num that was interning with me for a\nwhile\num is 16 years old at the time and very\nlean and um it wasn't small for his age\nbut he was smaller than us than the it\nwas all guys on the swim that day\nSometimes women join us\num and he got hypothermic\nand he's an excellent swimmer and he\ndidn't report feeling overly cold but um\nfortunately we got him to Shore and\nheated him up again\num so he lived I don't think his mother\nwas going to ever let him go swimming\nwith us again he's thriving in the world\nhe's a university student now\num and he recalls that swim I mean this\nis why you always want to Ocean swim\nwith a buddy with people\num yeah he he became hypothermic his\nteeth turned yellow he was slurring his\nwords he wasn't making sense you know we\ngot him on the shore and he was kind of\nyou know drooling and a little\nsemi-euphoric and then kind of you know\nit was\num hypothermia is no joke so I think\nyeah so I I I'm really glad that this is\ncoming up because the cold is a powerful\nstimulus and um and I and kids are at a\nand smaller bodied people are at a\ngreater risk of hypothermia so a good\nreason to approach it with caution maybe\nstart with cold showers get uh then cold\nimmersion and still water natural water\nand open bodies of water of course are\nalways going to be\num more dangerous for other reasons\ncurrents and things of that sort of\nexactly okay I'm drowning yeah so\nimportant note there\num what about any additional male female\ndifferences or similarities that um we\nshould be aware of and this comes up all\nthe time on social media anytime I post\nanything about a study it's what about\nwomen because oftentimes there are\ndifferences yeah yeah and and there are\nwe we also just took about the\ndifference in in in temperature in men\nand women so it means that if we did if\nwe replicated my study in women it could\nbe that they would have enough you can\nsay cold exposure with just nine minutes\nper week it could be because they\napparently are also just colder and and\nthey have increased metabolism in their\nBrown fat is just they have more Brown\nfat it could be but this is just\nsomething that I I frankly don't know\nbut women also do cold exposure winter\nswimming with the 11 minutes protocol I\ndo it myself and feel good about it so I\nwould say that\num women Also regarding activation of\nthe brown fat it should be the same\num in theory but I don't know if women\nactually\ndo you need to have another protocol\nwhen it comes to this rapid code\nexposure I think that it's another\nquestion if we are talking about ice\nswimming when it comes to how far can\nyou be in the cold water without getting\nhypothermic then there will be\ndifferences in men and and female but\nbut if you do this cold exposure for a\nvery brief amount of time which is what\nI try to to talk to about talk about\nwhat we call also micro stressing the\nbody to to increase the Hermetic stress\nthe healthy stress then this is such a\nshort amount of\num exposure that it it's fairly the same\nI think I think women can look at this\nas a fairly a good protocol for the for\nfor them as well I always say that if\nyou really dread the cold and um and\ndon't like the cold then you are a\nperfect candidate for using deliberate\ncold exposure because the sympathetic\naka the stress response will be greater\nand thereby the adaptation to that\nshorter one or two minutes is\num is going to be much greater right for\npeople that are perfectly comfortable in\nthe cold it's harder to get an\nadaptation response the same way that if\nsomebody's very strong and they can lift\na very heavy weight that that very heavy\nweight is unlikely to evoke the same\nkind of or same degree of of uh adaptive\nresponses if somebody is not quite as\nstrong so another reason to keep these\nexposures relatively short yeah and more\nfrequent than to do longer duration\nexposures frequently however let's say\nsomebody only had two days a week\num to do deliberate cold exposure maybe\nthey don't have access to Asana maybe\nthey do would you suggest that they get\nin for one or two minutes then get out\nthen get back in for another couple of\nminutes then get out and call that for\nyou know four or five minutes\num to try and get to that 11 minutes\ntotal per week\num as opposed to getting in for a full\nfive minutes\num and then getting out and coming back\na second time that week I know this is\ngetting down into the weeds but these\nare the sorts of things that I think\npeople really want to know because a lot\nof people either don't live close to a\nbody of water or don't have a cold\nplunge\num that they can do this with although\ncold shower apparently works too so most\npeople live close to a shower yeah it's\na definite I think the the changes in\ntemperature is what is\nstrengthening your your cells in the\nbody so if you can do the short amount\nof exposure and then get out and get\nback in that is gonna you can say um\nstrengthen yourselves because you are\nchallenging them to to adapt to\num changing temperatures so doing one\nsession you can change this right you\nyou can do it if you are able to go to\ncold water but also a sauna then you\njust do it that automatically you will\nhave a change in temperature but you\ncould also do it by variating the\ntemperature in your coat plunge if you\nhave\nif you have a plunge or if you have an\nopen CEO or you have seasoning Seasons\neven you have we have that in Denmark so\nwe have four seasons and the temperature\nis going to vary with that so we have\nnature who can just change this for us\nand we don't have to think about it if\nyou have a cold plunge well then I would\nsay that changing the temperature is\nwhat is going to create this hermetic\nstress and also keep your cells on its\ntoes you can say because you are tried\nthe body will still be um stressed to\ntry to adapt to the new temperature as\nit's seen as something actually toxic to\nthe body right it's a small small piece\nof toxicity that you are exposing\nyourself to\nwe don't have to swallow it but it's\nenough that you touch it actually yeah\ngreat a great way to frame it\num\nthat brings me back to this idea of\ncircadian time in your study you didn't\num control first specific time of day\nand now I'm realizing that may be a\ngreat asset to the whole thing so we\nknow for instance that our bodies go\nthrough pretty dramatic shifts in\ntemperature from the time we wake up\num our body starts heating up as we wake\nup and continues to heat until the\nafternoon and then starts to drop in the\nlater afternoon and then assuming all\nthings are working correctly\num that body temperature drops and we\nsleep so I could imagine that doing\ndeliberate cold exposure at different\ntimes just by way of convenience or by\nway of intention could be very\nbeneficial because my body temperature\nis going to be quite a bit warmer at one\ntime of day versus another and in that\nway keeping the system tuned and that's\nreally what I keep hearing coming\nthrough in as you explain these data and\nall these beautiful studies yours and\nothers is that it's not really about\ngetting cold it's about going from warm\nto cold and from cold to warm it's not\nit and I love this idea because I I\nprobably said this a hundred times on my\npodcast and a million times in my life\nand I'll continue to which is that\nbiology is not an event it's a process\nlike these these um metabolic and\nthermoregulatory processes are indeed\nlike the Turning of a knob it's a verb\nas opposed to a noun and I and so I I\nthink if people can internalize that\nidea that they're going to have a lot\nmore flexibility a lot more fun and and\nget a lot more benefit as opposed to\nthinking okay I need to get into X\ndegrees of water for x amount of time on\nX number of days yeah you know\nall the time how much and how cold and\nand I mean it's not it's just like well\nbecause we also don't have studies\nshowing exactly if you just keep five\ndegrees in your water and you do that\nfor a month then what happens we maybe\nthe future will know much more about\nthis and I'm sure it's going to come and\nI really hope so but I just think by\nlogically changing that temperature up\nand down up and down and you also do\nthat in your water it doesn't really\nit's not that important what temperature\nyou you will have your water then then\njust keep changing it going up and down\nit could be all up to 12 degrees Celsius\nyou're going to activate your brown fat\nanyways I mean 12 19 degrees a cold air\nis enough to activate your rampers so\nmaybe we don't have to go as cold as I\nthink many people think\num and putting ice even all the time it\nyou don't have to it's not I don't think\nit's necessary to to expose yourself to\nthat cold temperature all the time\num but vary it a bit so keep the system\noff balance and that's the way to keep\nit tuned Yeah you mentioned a study that\nis more recent or an ongoing that's not\npublished or um if you're willing um\ncould you share maybe some of the data\nfrom that our findings from that study\num with of course the the cue to\neverybody that these are not yet\npublished data so the conclusions could\nchange the data could change for that\nmatter yeah so we have we haven't\nanalyzed all the data yet and I I know\nfrom the study that we did publish that\nwe we would need to look more of the\ndata so I don't really have any results\nyet that I can share because we are\nstill in very preliminary analysis of\nthis so I I wouldn't know yet what to\nexactly say about it but what we looked\nat was both men and women method so\nthat's that's coming oh that's fantastic\nthat answer is going to please a great\nnumber of people and and Intrigue\neverybody so\nwell listen I I want to really thank you\nfor coming here today to talk about your\nwork\num and the incredible direction that it\npoints to because I think that\num you know no one study is definitive\nbut your study really again stands as a\nlandmark in the landscape of exploring\ndeliberate cold exposure and Heat\nhow it can impact and potentially impact\nour health because\nfrankly there just haven't been that\nmany\num high resolution uh detailed modern\nstudies of this there have been studies\nof sauna there have been some studies of\ncoal there are a lot of groups in\nphysiology that work on hypothermia and\nvery cold exposure but um most of the\ntemperatures used in those days just\naren't practical so first of all I just\nwant to thank you for doing the work\nthat you've done and for the work that\nyou continue to do I'm\num uh waiting with baited breath as they\nsay to um to hear the results of this\nstudy that's ongoing on both men and\nwomen so um we'll have to have you back\nto inform us about that soon and I want\nto thank you for\num the incredible public education\nefforts that you've been doing on social\nmedia\num and in with respect to your book\num and we of course will put links to\nall of those things in the show note\ncaptions so people can learn from you\nand can continue to learn from you we we\ncertainly need more scientists who are\nboth experienced with doing hardcore\nresearch as it's called and who also do\nthe practices I think that's a wonderful\nadditional asset you know you're not\njust behind a lab coat or bundled up in\na down uh in a down feather jacket as\neveryone else is getting in the cold you\ndo these things and
