    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are\ndiscussing psilocybin.\nPsilocybin is a psychedelic,\nmeaning it modifies the psyche.\nAnd in doing so, it changes\nour level of consciousness.\nPsychedelics, such as\npsilocybin changed the way\nthat we perceive the outside\nworld and our internal world,\nour memories, our thoughts,\nour feelings, et cetera.\nNot just while one is under\nthe influence of psilocybin,\nbut it can also\nfundamentally change\nall of those things afterwards\nand for a very long period\nof time afterwards\nas well, which\nis one of the\nreasons why there's\ngrowing excitement about the\napplication of psilocybin\nand other psychedelics\nfor the treatment\nof various mental health\nissues, such as depression,\nalcohol abuse disorder, and\naddictions of various kinds,\nas well as things like\nOCD and eating disorders.\nToday, we will\ndiscuss psilocybin,\ntalking about what it is.\nIn fact, you may be surprised to\nlearn that psilocybin basically\nis serotonin.\nNow, for those of you that\nare familiar with psilocybin\nand serotonin, you might\nthink, wait, that's not true.\nBut, in fact, psilocybin main\neffect is to mimic serotonin.\nBut it does it in\na very specific way\nbecause it activates a subset\nof serotonin receptors in a very\nstrong fashion leading\nto neuroplasticity\nat the level of the neural\ncircuits, that is the brain\nareas and the connections\nthat serve things like memory\nand perception.\nSo if any of that is\nconfusing at this point,\nI promise to make it all\nclear in just a few minutes.\nPsilocybin is one of many\npsychedelics, of course.\nThere are things like\nLSD, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT.\nEven MDMA while not considered\na classic psychedelic\nis considered a psychedelic\nin the general sense.\nToday's episode is going\nto focus on psilocybin\nin particular.\nI will tell you\nwhat psilocybin is,\nhow it works at the\nmolecular and cellular level.\nI'll talk about how it\nchanges brain circuitry.\nI'll talk about the\nclinical effects\nwhat's been demonstrated in\ncontrolled laboratory studies.\nI'll talk about\ndosages and translating\nfrom psilocybin mushrooms\nto actual psilocybin,\nand the compound\nthat actually exerts\nthe effects of psilocybin which\nit turns out is not psilocybin,\nbut something called psilocin.\nPsilocin is the\nactual compound that\ngoes into the brain to\ncreate all the changes\nin consciousness and\nall the rewiring effects\nthat we associate\nwith psilocybin.\nSo understanding how psilocybin\nis converted to psilocin\nhas tremendous impact on\nthe duration of a psilocybin\njourney, whether or not\nthat psilocybin journey\nis going to lead to a\nshort or longer window\nfor neuroplasticity.\nIn fact, many people\ndon't realize this.\nBut much of the positive changes\nthat are possible with proper--\nand I do want to underscore\nproper psilocybin therapeutic\napproaches, takes place after\nthe session in which one feels\nall typical or\ntypically associated\neffects of psilocybin like\nhallucinations and changes\nin thought patterns, et cetera.\nSo today, we are going to talk\na little bit about chemistry.\nBut I promise to make\nit accessible to anyone\nand everyone, regardless\nof whether or not\nyou have a background\nin chemistry or biology.\nWe're going to talk\nabout some cell\nbiology, the actual\nneuronal changes that occur\nwhen one takes psilocybin.\nAnd we're going to talk about\nhow neural circuits change\nover time and how all of\nthat impacts the changes\nthat most people are interested\nin when they go on a psilocybin\njourney.\nThings such as long\nstanding improvements\nin mood, things such\nas tremendous insight\ninto themselves and to others,\ninto their past, their present,\nand their future,\nand even changes\nin their levels of\ncreativity, or their ability\nto experience joy from\nmusic or their ability\nto dissociate in a\npositive way from things\nthat formerly were depressing\nor triggers for depression.\nIn fact, we're going\nto talk quite a lot\nabout the conditions inside\nof a psilocybin journey that\nmake it actually\npositive and therapeutic.\nThis is a very important point\nthat I'll make several times\nthroughout today's\nepisode, which\nis that just because\nsomething invokes\nneuroplasticity changes\nin brain circuitry\ndoes not mean that it's\ntherapeutic, or I should say,\ndoes not necessarily mean\nthat it's therapeutic.\nFor neuroplasticity\nto be therapeutic,\nit has to be adaptive,\nit has to allow someone\nto function better in life\nthan they did previously.\nSo today, we will talk about how\nthe conditions of a psilocybin\njourney, including\nwhether or not\nit's done with eyes\nclosed or eyes open,\nor whether or not people\nalternate between eyes\nclosed and eyes open\nphases of that journey,\nas well as whether or not music\nis played during that journey,\nand even what types\nof music are played\nwill dictate whether\nor not somebody\nwill feel better or worse in\nthe days and weeks and years\nfollowing that psilocybin\njourney, as well as the dosage\nlevel.\nBecause as you'll\nsoon learn as well,\nthere are clinical\nstudies showing that just\none psilocybin journey\ncan improve mood\nin a long-standing way.\nBut most clinical trials\ninvolve two dosages\nspaced in very precise ways from\none another with appropriate\nfollow up.\nBut in both of those\nparticular journeys,\nthe structure of the\njourney who's present,\nwho's not present,\neyes open or eyes\nclosed, the particular\nmusic that's played.\nAll of those\nfeatures make up part\nof a larger\nneuroplasticity trigger\nof which psilocybin is critical.\nBut psilocybin is not\nthe only variable.\nSo whether or not\nyou're interested\nin participating in a clinical\nstudy, or whether or not you're\ninterested in psilocybin\nfor other reasons,\nthis is critical\ninformation to understand.\nSo today, we're going to talk\nabout nearly every feature\nof psilocybin possible,\nincluding what psilocybin is,\nhow it works at the level\nof chemistry cell biology,\nand neural networks,\nand neuroplasticity.\nWe'll talk about the\nclinical studies.\nWe'll talk about dosages.\nWe will talk about conditions\nof clinical studies,\nand we will talk about the\npost psilocybin journey\nperiod in which neuroplasticity\nand the various activities,\nincluding therapy or\nperhaps not therapy\ncan contribute to positive\ntherapeutic changes\nfrom psilocybin.\nNow, as we go into\nthis discussion,\nI do want to underscore the fact\nthat at the time of recording\nthis episode, meaning\nnow, May 2023,\npsilocybin is still\na Schedule I drug.\nIt is considered illegal\nin the United States.\nThere's perhaps just\none exception to that,\nmaybe a few others.\nBut the main exception is\nin the state of Oregon,\npsilocybin has been approved in\nparticular therapeutic settings\nfor use in particular\nconditions namely depression\nand some forms of addiction.\nSo in Oregon, it's more\nor less in the domain\nof a decriminalized as\nopposed to actually legal.\nIn other areas of the country,\nincluding Oakland, California,\nthere are some areas in which\nit has been decriminalized.\nAnd perhaps there are a few\nothers that I'm not aware of.\nBut, in general, psilocybin\nand other psychedelics\nare still considered illegal.\nAnd this is very important.\nNot just saying\nthis to protect me,\nI'm saying this to protect you.\nPossessing or certainly\nselling psilocybin,\nexcept for rare instances,\nsuch as clinical studies\nand these decriminalized\nareas that I\ntalked about a moment ago is\nstill very much not allowed\nunder the law.\nToday, I'll also\ndiscuss safety issues.\nI'll talk about whether\nor not young people,\nmeaning people 25 or younger\nshould consider psilocybin\ngiven that their brain is\nstill in a rampant period\nof naturally occurring\nneuroplasticity.\nI will also talk about\ndosages as it relates\nto people who have\nformerly been on\nor may currently be on different\nforms of antidepressants.\nAnd I will talk\nabout people who are\nat risk for psychotic\nepisodes either\nbecause they know\nthey themselves\nhave a propensity for psychosis\nor they have close family\nmembers who have psychosis,\nwhich includes things\nlike schizophrenia, bipolar\ndepression, as well as things\nlike borderline personality,\nand some related\npsychiatric conditions.\nSo today's episode really will\nbe a deep dive into psilocybin.\nSo whether or not you\nthink you're already\nfamiliar with psilocybin\nand its effects,\nor whether or not you're\njust curious about them,\nI do encourage if you're willing\nto try and ratchet through some\nof the understanding\nof how psilocybin works\nand what it is,\nleading up to some\nof the therapeutic applications\nand different patterns\nof dosing spacing of\ndifferent sessions, et cetera.\nBecause I do believe that\nwith that knowledge in hand,\nyou will be able to\nmake far better, much\nmore informed decisions\nabout whether or not\npsilocybin is right for you.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however,\npart of my desire\nand effort to bring zero\ncost to consumer information\nabout science and\nscience related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor\nis Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nNow sleep is the foundation of\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nEverything goes far better\nwhen we are sleeping well\non a consistent basis.\nNow, one of the key things to\ngetting a great night's sleep\nis to make sure that the\ntemperature of your sleeping\nenvironment is correct.\nIn fact, your body temperature\nhas to drop by 1 to 3 degrees\nin order to fall asleep\nand stay deeply asleep.\nAnd waking up involves a\nheating up of your body\nby about 1 to 3 degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep, you\ncan program your mattress\nto be a specific temperature\nat the beginning, middle,\nand towards the end\nof your sleep night.\nEver since I started sleeping\non an eight sleep mattress,\nI've slept far better\nthan I ever have.\nSo it's an all around\ngreat tool that\nhas tremendous functionality,\nnot just for measuring,\nbut for improving your sleep.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman\nand save $150 off\ntheir pod three cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, UK, select countries\nin the EU, and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nNow, I've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges\nin order to make sure\nthat you can see clearly\nunder any conditions.\nROKA understands all of that\nand is designed their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses so that\nregardless of whether or not\nyou're in a very brightly\nlit area or a more shady area\nor you go from brightly\nlit to shady areas,\nyou can always see with\ntremendous clarity.\nNow, even though they were\ninitially designed for sport,\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\ncome in a tremendous number\nof different aesthetics.\nSo they have the what\nI call cyborg versions\nthat most people associate\nwith triathlon glasses\nand sports-related glasses.\nBut they also have\na tremendous number\nof frames that you feel\nperfectly comfortable\nwearing to work or out\nto dinner, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA,\nthat's roka.com.\nAnd enter the code huberman to\nsave 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com\nand enter the code huberman\nat checkout.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by HVMN Ketone-IQ.\nKetone-IQ is a ketone supplement\nthat increases blood ketones.\nNow, I know most people are\nfamiliar or at least have\nheard of the so-called ketogenic\ndiet, which is essentially\na very low carbohydrate diet.\nIt's designed to get your\nbrain and body functioning\noff ketones, which are a great\nsource of fuel for the body\nand brain.\nHowever, most people, including\nmyself are not ketogenic.\nThat is I'm not\nin a ketose state,\npretty much ever\nas far as I know.\nNonetheless, with Ketone-IQ, you\ncan increase your blood ketones\nand thereby improve\nthings like cognition\nand physical performance.\nI find that when\ntaking Ketone-IQ,\neven if I'm eating a\nstandard omnivore diet, which\nis the diet that I follow,\nby taking Ketone-IQ\nprior to workouts, sometimes\non an empty stomach,\nand especially prior to doing\nany kind of cognitive work\nso researching podcasts, or\ndoing work related to my lab,\nor teaching, et cetera, that\nI can maintain mental clarity\nfor a longer period of time.\nAnd it does seem to enhance\nmy mental clarity as well.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Ketone-IQ, you\ncan go to hvmn.com and use\nthe code Huberman to get 20%.\nOff, again, that's hvmn.com,\nand use the code huberman\nto get 20% off.\nLet's talk about psilocybin.\nAnd, again, today we're\ngoing to focus specifically\non psilocybin.\nAnd we're going to set aside\nall the other psychedelics\nfor future episodes.\nPsilocybin is what's\ncalled a tryptamine.\nThat refers to its\nchemical composition,\nnot to the so-called\npsychedelic trip.\nIn fact, it's\nspelled differently.\nTryptamine is T-R-Y-P.\nTrip, T-R-I-P, of course.\nTryptamines include\npsilocybin, but also\nthings like DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.\nThe tryptamine\npsychedelics very closely\nresemble serotonin itself.\nThat's right.\nMost of you have probably heard\nof the chemical serotonin.\nAnd serotonin is what's\ncalled a neuromodulator, which\nmeans your brain and\nbody naturally make it,\nand that it modifies or changes\nthe activity of other neurons\nand neural circuits.\nAnd it does that generally by\neither increasing or decreasing\nthe activity of those\nneural circuits.\nIf I were to show you a picture\nof the chemical structure\nof psilocybin or its\nactive derivative psilocin,\nand I were to also\nput right alongside it\nan image of the chemical\nstructure of serotonin,\nprovided that you weren't\na chemist who really likes\nto focus on the detailed\ndifferences between things,\nyou would say those\nlook very similar.\nAnd indeed, psilocybin in\nits active form psilocin\nare very similar\nstructurally and chemically\nto serotonin itself.\nNow, as I mentioned before,\nserotonin is something\nthat you naturally make.\nAnd yes, it's true\nthat about 90%\nof the serotonin in\nyour brain and body\nis manufactured in your gut.\nHowever, contrary\nto popular belief,\nthe serotonin in your\nbrain is not manufactured\nfrom the serotonin in your gut.\nYou have separate independent\nsources of serotonin.\nThat is you have\nparticular neurons that\nmake serotonin in your brain.\nYou also have\nserotonin in your gut\nand those work more or less\nin parallel separately.\nNow, what does serotonin do.\nThis is really important\nto understand because\nof the similarity\nbetween psilocybin\nin its active form\npsilocin and serotonin.\nSerotonin in that\nit's a neuromodulator\nchanges the activity\nof other neurons\nand the net effects\nof those changes\nare things that\nyou're familiar with.\nFor instance, satiety or\nthe feeling that we've had\nenough of various\nthings, such as food,\nor a social interaction, or\nsex, or pleasure of any kind.\nSerotonin is involved\nin all of that.\nAnd an enormous number\nof other things,\nsuch as mood regulation such\nas our sense of pleasure\nitself, or lack of\npleasure, such as whether\nor not we feel motivated\nor not motivated.\nIt works in concert with\nother neuromodulators,\nsuch as dopamine and\nepinephrine and norepinephrine.\nIn fact, if this were an\nepisode about serotonin,\nwhich it is not.\nYou would soon\nrealize that serotonin\nis involved in so many\ndifferent functions that\nimpact our daily life.\nAnd that is one reason\nwhy certain antidepressant\nmedications which alter\neither increase or decrease\nthe amount of serotonin\ntransmission in the brain\nwill often have a\nlot of side effects\nrelated to things like mood,\nlibido, appetite, sleep, et\ncetera.\nIt's because\nserotonin is involved\nin so many different things.\nAnd serotonin is involved\nin so many different things\nbecause there are a lot of\ndifferent so-called serotonin\nreceptors.\nSerotonin is a chemical\nthat we call a ligand.\nAnd the chemical\nligand is simply\nthe thing that plugs into the\nreceptor for that chemical\nor ligand.\nThe receptors, in this\ncase, serotonin receptors,\nhave the opportunity to do\nall sorts of different things.\nThey can change the activity\nof neurons making them\nmore active or less active.\nThey can cause growth factors\nto be released making sure\nthat those neurons\nreinforce or even build up\nstronger connections\nso that they're\nmore likely to be\nactive in the future.\nSerotonin binding to\nparticular receptors\ncan even change the gene\nexpression in particular cells\nmaking those cells proliferate.\nSo make more of them.\nMaking those cells more\nrobust, making those cells\ninteract with new elements\nof the brain and body.\nBasically, serotonin and all\nthese different receptors\nthat it binds to has dozens,\nif not hundreds, and maybe even\nthousands of\ndifferent functions.\nSo the fact that psilocybin\nso closely resembles serotonin\nleads to a very\nimportant question\nthat we should all be asking\nourselves, which is, why is it\nthat psilocybin, which looks\nso much like serotonin when one\ntakes it in the form\nof magic mushrooms,\nor some other form, maybe the\nsynthetic form of psilocybin\nitself, which nowadays is\nmanufactured in laboratories\nand placed in different\npsilocybin containing\nfoods and pills, et cetera.\nWhy that leads to complex\nyet fairly circumscribed\nsets of experience like visual\nand auditory hallucinations,\nchanges in particular\nthought patterns,\nand neuroplasticity\nthat, in many cases,\nin the clinical setting provided\nthings are done correctly.\nImprovements in mood,\nrelief from depression,\nrelief from various compulsive\ndisorders, et cetera.\nAll right.\nThis is really what\nyou need to understand\nif you want to understand\npsilocybin, and how it works,\nand how to make\nit work optimally\nfor a given condition or goal.\nYou have to understand\nwhat it's actually doing\nand what allows psilocybin\nto do fairly specific things\nin comparison to serotonin.\nEven though psilocybin and\nserotonin are so similar\nis that psilocybin mainly\nbinds to and activates\nthe so-called serotonin\nto a receptor.\nThe serotonin to\nreceptors is one\nof, again, many different\nserotonin receptors.\nBut serotonin 2A is expressed\nin particular areas of the brain\nand even on particular areas\nof neurons in the brain that\nallow for very specific types\nof changes in neural circuitry\nto take place, not\njust when one is\nunder the influence\nof psilocybin,\nbut afterwards as well.\nSo really in order to\nhave a useful discussion\nabout psilocybin, we need to\ntalk a lot about the serotonin\nto a receptor.\nBut fortunately for\nyou, unless you're\nsomebody really interested\nin structural biology or cell\nbiology, that\ndiscussion is not going\nto be about the binding pocket\nfor serotonin on serotonin 2A\nreceptor, or a lot of\nthe downstream signaling\nof the serotonin to a receptor.\nWe'll talk a little bit about\nthat where it's relevant.\nBut more importantly, at least\nfor sake of today's discussion,\nwe're going to talk about\nhow the serotonin 2A\nreceptors really the one\nresponsible for triggering\nall the changes in\nneural circuitry\nthat lead to the changes, that\nis the improvements in mood,\nthe relief from compulsive\ndisorders in many cases,\nbut really it's the serotonin\n2A receptor selectivity\nof psilocybin that is\nleading to all the excitement\nthat you hear about\nin terms of psilocybin\nas a therapeutic tool.\nLet me say that from a\nslightly different angle.\nThere are data that I'll\ntalk about today, which\nshow that one,\nalthough in most cases,\ntwo psilocybin journeys\ndone with particular dosages\nof psilocybin lead\nto maximal binding\nor occupancy of those\nserotonin 2A receptors\nin ways that lead to significant\nand unprecedented relief\nfor major depression.\nIn fact, you'll soon learn\nthat the clinical trials\nfor psilocybin are\noutperforming standard therapy\nand outperforming\nso-called SSRIs\nand various other\nantidepressants\nin terms of providing depression\nrelief in ways that are frankly\nstaggering not just to me, but\nto the psychiatric community\nat large.\nAnd this is where so much of\nthe excitement is coming from.\nNow that statement\ncould be taken\none way, which is to\njust say, OK, well,\nhere's a compound psilocybin\nthat outperforms SSRIs.\nAnd, therefore,\nall the attention\nshould be on psilocybin.\nBut SSRI stands for Selective\nSerotonin Reuptake Inhibitor.\nIn other words,\nthe SSRIs of which\nthere is now a lot\nof controversy things\nlike Prozac, Zoloft, et cetera--\nI'm sure you've heard\nsome of this controversy.\nThere are people who are\nvery pro SSRIs although there\nare a growing number of\npeople who really feel\nthat the SSRIs are probably\nmost appropriate for things\nlike obsessive compulsive\ndisorder where they, in fact,\ncan be very beneficial.\nBut there is a lot of\nleaning back from SSRIs\nas the be all end all for\nthe treatment of depression\nnowadays because of the\nside effect profiles.\nAnd the fact that it's\nnot even really clear\nthat serotonin deficiencies are\nthe major cause of depression\nin the first place.\nNow, again, we're talking about\npsilocybin not about SSRIs,\nbut you should be\nthinking, wait,\nhow is it that two\nmolecules psilocybin\nand some particular\nSSRI both of which\nlook like and/or\nincrease serotonin\ntransmission in the brain are\nleading to either incredibly\npositive and\ninteresting outcomes\nor to troubling side\neffect riddled outcomes?\nAnd, again, it all\nboils back down\nto the selectivity\nof psilocybin to bind\nthat serotonin to a receptor.\nAnd so in order to understand\nhow psilocybin works\nand in order to understand\nproper dosing profiles\nand spacing of sessions\na.k.a. journeys,\nwe really need to talk a little\nbit more about the serotonin\nto a receptor, where it is in\nthe brain, what sorts of things\nhappen when psilocybin binds\nthe serotonin to a receptor,\nand how those things\nset in motion,\nthe various changes,\nthe neuroplasticity\nthat allows people to feel\nbetter in terms of their mood,\nand as you'll soon\nlearn, can experience\nmore pleasure and joy from\nthings like music and enhanced\ncreativity.\nAll the things that I do\nbelieve whether or not\npeople are thinking about or\nmaybe even exploring psilocybin\nfor recreational or therapeutic\npurposes, all the things\nthat people want and\nare really talking about\nand perhaps even doing\npsilocybin in order to obtain.\nSo before going\nany further, I just\nwant to place an\nimage in your mind.\nYou can place an image in your\nmind whereby when serotonin\nis released in the\nbrain naturally\nnot having taken any\ncompound, any drug, anything.\nIt's getting released a\nlot of different sites\nbinding to a lot of different\nserotonin receptors,\ndoing a lot of different things.\nWhen somebody takes an\nSSRI, the net effect\nof that selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitor\nis that there's more serotonin\naround to exert its effects.\nBecause it's a\nreuptake inhibitor\nat the synapse, the\nconnections between neurons,\nthe serotonin can do its\nthing more extensively\nand for longer periods of time.\nBut it's doing it\nnon-specifically.\nSo when you think about standard\nantidepressant treatments,\nat least for sake\nof this discussion,\nyou think of a sprinkling\nor a spraying of serotonin\nat different locations\nin the brain and binding\nto lots of different receptors.\nWhereas when you think\nabout psilocybin, even\nthough the subjective\neffects are pretty diverse,\nwe'll talk about those in a\nfew moments, what you're really\ntalking about is a\nmolecule of psilocybin\nthat looks a lot\nlike serotonin that\nis selectively and very\nstrongly binding to\nand activating that\nserotonin to a receptor.\nSo that's the image I'd like\nyou to embed in your mind.\nAnd then the next image I'd\nlike you to embed in your mind\nis where these\nserotonin 2A receptors\nare located in the brain.\nNow, the serotonin 2A\nreceptors are located\nin multiple brain regions.\nBut they have a tremendous\namount of expression\nin the so-called neocortex,\nthe outside of the brain that\nincludes things like our\nprefrontal cortex, which\nis involved in understanding\ncontext, which behaviors,\nthoughts, and\nspeech patterns are\nappropriate for\ncertain circumstances,\nhow to switch context and\ncategory switch when you go\nfrom playing sports, to\nhanging out with friends,\nto being in a\nprofessional setting.\nYou change your behavior\nin the way that you speak\nand perhaps even the\nway that you think.\nYou might think some things\nthat are out of context.\nBut you probably keep\nthose to yourself.\nAnd your ability to\nkeep those to yourself\nare dependent on a\nfunctional prefrontal cortex.\nThere are a lot of 5-HT2A.\nAnd by the way 5-HT is the\nabbreviation for serotonin.\nSo there are a lot of\nserotonin 2 receptors\nin the prefrontal cortex,\nalso in other areas\nof the cortex that\nare associated\nwith sensation and perception.\nThat is hearing of sounds, that\nis seeing of particular things.\nAnd in particular, there\nis a very, very, very high\nexpression of serotonin 2A\nreceptors in the visual cortex.\nAnd that is one of the\nreasons why psilocybin\ntriggers visual hallucinations.\nAnd provided\npsilocybin is present\nat sufficient enough\nconcentration that\nis taken at a\nsufficient dosage, one\nwill experience profound visual\nhallucinations regardless of\nwhether or not their eyes are\nopen or their eyes are closed.\nNow, that's an important\nfact because it explains\none of the major\neffects of psilocybin\nthat people experience\nwhile they are on the drug.\nNow, as I'll talk about\na little bit later\nin terms of what constitutes\na useful psilocybin\nsession, useful meaning that\nit's leading to adaptive\nimprovements in mood, adaptive\nimprovements in creativity,\nin cognition, et cetera, is that\npeople not have their eyes open\nfor at least the majority\nof the psilocybin session,\nthis is something I've discussed\nwith several experts who\nare running clinical\nstudies on psilocybin\nin their laboratories,\nsome of whom\nare going to be guests\non the Huberman Lab\npodcast in upcoming episodes,\nAgain, I can't\nunderscore this enough.\nBecause your visual\ncortex contains\nso many of these\nserotonin 2A receptors,\nand because psilocybin binds\nso strongly to that serotonin\nto a receptor, you're\ngoing to experience\na lot of visual\nhallucinations when\nyou are under the\ninfluence of psilocybin.\nThere's no surprise there.\nThis has been known\nfor hundreds, if not,\nthousands of years.\nIt's one of the main reasons\nwhy people take psilocybin.\nHowever, as I mentioned\nearlier, these hallucinations\noccur even when the\neyes are closed.\nAnd it's now fairly\nwell-established\nthat if people are to\ntake psilocybin and have\ntheir eyes open, much\nof their cognition,\nmuch of their thinking,\nmuch of the time spent\nin that psilocybin\njourney is focused\non the altered\nperceptions of things\nin the outside environment.\nSometimes this looks like a\nfracturing of the outside world\ninto geometric shapes.\nSometimes it\nappears as a melting\nof things in the\nvisual environment,\nincluding people's faces or\na morphing of people's faces.\nAll of that has a\nstrong let's just\ncall it a draw for\na lot of people\nwho are looking for a\nhighly unusual experience\ninside of the\npsilocybin journey.\nBut I think if one's goal is\nto derive long-lasting benefit\nfrom the psilocybin\nexperience, it's\nvery clear that having an eye\nmask or some other eye covering\nor something that ensures\nthat one's eyes are closed\nfor the majority, if not, the\nentire psilocybin session is\ngoing to be very\nuseful because it's\ngoing to limit the extent\nto which one is focused\non those outside changes\nin visual perception a.k.a.\nhallucinations and rather\nwill allow the person\nto go inward to combine\nwhatever it is that they happen\nto be seeing in their mind's\neye with the different thoughts\nand memories and changes\nin their emotions\nthat are occurring.\nAnd that going inward by\nstaying in the eye mask,\nat least for the\nmajority of the time,\nseems to be a very, if\nnot, the critical feature\nof making the psilocybin\njourney effective in\nthe therapeutic sense.\nNow once again, I want to cue to\nsome of the safety precautions\nhere.\nI'm going to say this at least\nthree times throughout today's\nepisode.\nAs I'm talking now and\nvarious other times\nthroughout today's episode,\nyou may get the impression\nthat I'm all for everybody\ndoing psilocybin.\nAnd that is simply not the case.\nIn order for a\npsilocybin journey\nto be therapeutically useful, it\ndoes require certain conditions\nand supports.\nAnd there are certain people\nfor which psilocybin use\nis going to be\ncontraindicated, meaning\nthey should not do psilocybin.\nIn particular, people\nwho have existing or have\na predisposition to psychotic\nepisodes or bipolar episodes,\neven having a first\nrelative who has bipolar,\nor schizophrenic, or\nschizotypal issues\ncan be a rule out condition,\nthat is can get someone\neliminated from a clinical\nstudy on psilocybin\nfor fear of triggering\npsychotic episodes,\nnot just during the\npsilocybin journey,\nbut potentially in\na long standing way.\nSo, again, that's\nreally critical.\nThe other thing\nis that everything\nI'm talking about today\nunless I say otherwise\nis really focused on\nadults, meaning people who\nare 25 years old or older.\nThat is their basic wiring\nand rewiring of the brain\nthat we call developmental\nneuroplasticity is completed.\nAll right.\nMost of the studies\ntoday that I'll\ntalk about involve subjects\nranging from 25 years of age\nout to about 70 years of\nage, but no one younger.\nSo, again, psilocybin\nand its use\nis certainly not for everybody.\nIt's still illegal, it's being\nused in the clinical setting\nand research setting.\nThere are these pockets\nof decriminalized areas,\nand potentially soon\nlegalization of psilocybin,\nbut again only in the\nproper clinical setting.\nOK.\nAgain, I say that not\njust to protect myself,\nbut I say that also\nto protect all of you.\nPsilocybin is a\npowerful, powerful drug.\nNot just to be under\nthe influence of,\nbut also in terms of its\nlong-standing changes\nafter the effects of\npsilocybin have worn off.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens now called AG1\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens,\nonce or usually twice a day,\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy to mix\nup Athletic Greens while you're\non the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3 K2.\nLet's talk a little bit\nabout dosing of psilocybin\nand also about\nmicrodosing of psilocybin.\nNow, this is an area that I\nwouldn't say is controversial,\nbut that there's how\nshould we say this.\nThere's a lot of\nloose thinking around\nthis in the non-clinical\nnon-research communities.\nBut within the clinical\nand research communities,\nthere is a lot of\ndata that's come\nout indicating what effective\nand safe doses provided\nall other things\nare considered safe.\nSafe doses of\npsilocybin actually are.\nAnd here, we really can go back\nto our discussion of psilocybin\nas quote-unquote magic\nmushrooms or mushrooms.\nAnd if one were to\ntranslate from the mushroom\nform of psilocybin to the\npsilocybin that's actually\nused in various studies--\nbecause frankly,\nin these studies, people\naren't eating mushrooms.\nThey're typically taking\nsynthetic psilocybin\neither intravenously injected\ninto a vein or orally.\nAnd that's how the researchers\nare able to tightly control\nthe amount of psilocybin.\nAnd the typical dosage that's\nused in clinical studies\nranges from 1 milligram\noften given repeatedly\nfrom day-to-day over\nlong periods of time,\nso-called microdosing.\nAnd really that 1 milligram\nper day or even up\nto 3 milligrams per day\nrepeatedly over time\nis what people generally\nthink of as microdosing.\nAs compared to say a\n10-milligram dose given once,\nmaybe twice in two separate\nsessions, or a 25 to 30\nmilligram dosage that's\ngiven once or twice.\nNow, those amounts of 1 to 3\nmilligrams or 10 milligrams,\nor 25 to 30 milligrams\nmight not mean\nmuch to those of\nyou that don't think\nabout these things in\nthe research terms.\nPerhaps, you've\nheard of microdosing\nand you've also heard of macro\nor quote-unquote heroic dosing.\nOK.\nThat's common or I should\nsay popular nomenclature\nfor psychedelics.\nAnd I'll circle back to\nthat in a few minutes.\nBut I think one of the\nquestions that I hear a lot is,\nhow much psilocybin is present\nin a given amount of mushrooms?\nAnd so the way this\ntypically works\nis that mushrooms are often\ndiscussed in terms of grams,\nor ounces.\nSo an 1/8 of mushrooms\nrefers to an 1/8\nof an ounce of mushrooms, or x\nnumber of grams of mushrooms.\nThe breakdown is\nactually quite simple.\n1000 milligrams equals 1 gram.\nAnd the concentration\nof psilocybin\nin most so-called magic\nmushrooms is about 1%.\nSo 1 gram of mushrooms\nbeing 1000 milligrams\nmeans that it contains\napproximately.\nAnd, again, it's approximately\n10 milligrams of psilocybin.\nAnd in most of the\nclinical studies,\nit's been shown that the\ndosage of 25 to 30mg given--\nor I should say,\ntaken once or twice--\nand we'll talk about the spacing\nof sessions a little bit later,\ntaken once or twice is what's\nleading to the most pronounced\ntherapeutic outcomes.\nBut, of course, with enhanced\ntherapeutic outcomes,\none also observes enhanced\nside effect profiles or what\nare called adverse events.\nSo there's an important\nnuanced conversation\nthat has to take place.\nBut right now, we're talking\nabout the conversion of grams\nof mushrooms to psilocybin.\nSo 1 gram of mushrooms being\n1000 milligrams containing\n1% psilocybin means\nthat it contains\n10 milligrams of psilocybin.\nNow, the so-called heroic\ndoses that you've heard about.\nAnd this is something\nthat's discussed.\nMore with the let's call\nthem traditional or classic\nPsychonauts.\nThese are people that may\nhave an advanced degree,\nbut typically are not\nrunning laboratories\nexploring the\neffects of psilocybin\nin controlled clinical trials.\nThese are people who have been\nlong time explorers, and often\nwriters, and people\nwho have been\nspokespeople for psilocybin\nand other psychedelics.\nAnd they will often refer to\nthe so-called heroic doses.\nIt's a little bit\nhard to translate\nfrom that informal community\nto the scientific data.\nBut in discussing that topic\nwith various researchers who\nrun laboratories at\nmajor universities\nfocused on psychedelic\ntherapies, what I was told\nis that the quote-unquote\nheroic dose that's\noften discussed really\nrefers to a 5-gram or so dose\nof mushrooms.\nSo what that translates to is\n50 milligrams of psilocybin.\nSo when you hear someone talk\nabout a quote-unquote heroic\ndose, they're probably\nreferring to ingestion\nof 50 milligrams or\nso of psilocybin,\nbut in its mushroom form.\nSo about 5 grams of mushrooms.\nAnd, again, it's\nimportant to point out\nthat the concentration\nof psilocybin\nin different\nstrains of mushrooms\nand in different\nbatches, and depending\non the age of those mushrooms,\nand how they've been stored,\net cetera, can vary tremendously\nfrom batch to batch.\nIn fact, there are\nsome laboratories\nthat have explored the range\nof psilocybin concentration\nin different mushroom strains\nand different so-called magic\nmushrooms.\nAnd that range is pretty broad.\nIt's anywhere from 1/2%\nall the way up to 2%.\nWhat that means is\nthat someone might\nget a hold of 1 gram of\nmushrooms thinking that they're\ntaking 10 milligrams\nof psilocybin\nin those mushrooms when,\nin fact, they're actually\ntaking 20.\nOr somebody could take 3\ngrams of mushrooms thinking\nthey're taking 30\ngrams of psilocybin\nand in fact they're\nonly taking 10\nor 15 milligrams of psilocybin.\nSo the sourcing is\nreally key obviously\nas things become more legal, and\nmore regulated, and more used\nin the therapeutic setting.\nAnd this is what's\nhappening more and more.\nOr as people start to rely on\nsynthetically made psilocybin\nas opposed to using mushrooms\nto ingest psilocybin.\nThen certainly,\nthe dosage thing is\ngoing to be more consistent\nfrom batch to batch\nbecause we're not talking\nabout batches of mushrooms,\nwe're talking about batches\nof psilocybin itself.\nSo now, I'd like\nto take a step back\nfrom all this chemistry\nand cell biology\nand talk a little bit about\nthe structure of a psilocybin\njourney itself and relate\nthat to what we now\nknow about what's\nhappening in the brain\nduring the psilocybin journey.\nAnd then a little bit later, we\nwill return to that serotonin\nto a receptor.\nWhen we talk about some of the\nmore lasting changes in brain\nchemistry and brain wiring,\nthat occur after the psilocybin\njourney is over.\nSo let's take a\ncouple of minutes\nand just discuss the\nvarious components\nof an effective therapeutic\npsilocybin journey.\nAnd here I'm not\ndetailing a menu of things\nthat people should do in\norder to pretend that they are\na psilocybin assisted\ntherapy coach,\nor to do self-administered\npsilocybin therapy.\nThat is not what I'm doing.\nWhat I am trying to do\nis to share with you\nthe consistent\ncomponents that are\npresent in the clinical\ntrials that have demonstrated\nthe effectiveness of psilocybin\nfor the treatment of depression\nand for other compulsive\nand addictive disorders.\nAnd those data, meaning\nthe specific data\nrelated to those trials and\nthe references themselves,\nwe'll get into a\nlittle bit later.\nBut we can't really have a\nconversation about psilocybin\nand what it does without\ntalking about the so-called set\nand setting as it's\noften referred to.\nThat is known to at least bias\nthe probability of the journey\nbeing beneficial and not\na so-called bad trip.\nSo what are the variables that\nmake up an effective and safe\npsilocybin journey?\nAnd, again, when\nwe say safe we're\nreferring to people who are not\nprone to psychotic episodes,\nthat don't even have a\nfirst relative that's\nprone to psychotic episodes.\nWe're talking about people\nthat are 25 years or older.\nWe're talking about people\nthat, for instance, are not\ntaking antidepressants that\nimpact the serotonin system.\nThis is very important\nto understand.\nI think a lot of\npeople don't know this.\nBut as far as I know,\nall of the studies\nthat have explored\npsilocybin for its ability\nto positively impact brain\nchemistry and mood and function\nhave required that\npeople either not be on\nor abstain from\nantidepressants in the weeks\nleading up to the\npsilocybin journey.\nNow, that is not to say\nthat if you are currently\ntaking SSRIs or something\nsimilar that you should\ncease taking them\nand do psilocybin,\nI'm absolutely not saying\nthat could be very, very, very\ndangerous if not catastrophic.\nAnytime you're going to\ntake anything or stop\ntaking anything for\nthat matter, you\ndo need to consult\nwith your physician.\nIn this case, a\npsychiatrist as well.\nSo let's talk about\npsilocybin journeys\nfrom the subjective side and\nfrom the structural side.\nAnd when I say the\nstructural side, what I mean\nis what is a psychedelic\njourney actually include?\nAnd here are the\nwords set and setting\nbecome extremely important.\nSome of you may have heard\nthat set and setting are\nthe foundation of a well done or\neven therapeutically beneficial\npsychedelic journey.\nAnd all of that really hinges\non safety and outcomes.\nSo set refers to mindset.\nThe mindset of the person\ntaking the psychedelic.\nAnd setting refers to--\nas the name\nsuggests, the setting\nin which they're taking\nit in and the people\nthat are present there.\nSo let's talk about\nsetting first.\nThe setting for a\npsychedelic journey\nneeds to be one in\nwhich the person\nunder the influence of the\npsilocybin or other psychedelic\nis safe.\nThat means no windows\nthey can jump out of,\nthat means no streets of moving\ncars, they can run out into.\nThat means no opportunity\nfor getting lost.\nThat means no opportunity for\ngetting into bodies of water.\nIn other words, it requires\nthat there be at least one,\nand perhaps even two or\nmore other individuals\nwho are not also taking\npsychedelics who are not also\ntaking psychedelics present\nin that setting to ensure\nthat the person\ntaking the psilocybin\nis not going to harm\nthemselves or others.\nI say this not to sound\nlike a school teacher,\neven though technically\nI'm a school teacher,\nbut because, of course, I don't\nwant anyone to get harmed.\nAnd I'm also aware that there's\na lot of interest nowadays\nin psychedelics, such\nas psilocybin becoming\nlegal or decriminalized for\ntheir therapeutic applications.\nAnd if we look back to the\nlate 1960s and early 1970s\nwhen the Controlled\nSubstances Act was invoked\nto make psychedelics\nlike psilocybin illegal,\none of the bases for\nthat was not just\nthe geopolitical\nunrest at the time\nand things like the\nVietnam War, but also some\nhighlighted instances\nin which people did not\ntake set and setting\ninto consideration,\ntook things like LSD, stared\nat the sun, went blind.\nOr took psilocybin, went out,\nand harmed somebody else.\nAgain, these are very,\nvery isolated instances.\nBut these are the\nexact instances\nthat lead to\ncriminalization or the fact\nthat things like psilocybin, and\nLSD, and MDMA for that matter\nare considered illegal.\nAgain, I completely\nacknowledge that there\nare a number of different\nfactors making them illegal.\nWe could have a whole\ndiscussion about that.\nWe talk about the drug\ntrade, the war on drugs.\nBut right now, it's such a\ncritical time in the history\nand the use of psychedelics for\ntherapeutic and other reasons.\nAnd getting setting correct,\nmeaning making it absolutely as\nsafe as possible for the\nperson taking the psychedelic\nis absolutely key.\nAnd one of the best ways\nto ensure that it's safe\nis to have responsible\nindividuals who\nare not under the\ninfluence of psychedelics\npresent in that environment.\nSo that's one\ncomponent of setting.\nThe other component of\nsetting that we talked\nabout earlier, which turns\nout to be very important\nis the opportunity\nand perhaps even\nthe bias toward the person\non the psychedelic being\nseated or ideally lying down\nand being in the eye mask\nor at least having\ntheir eyes covered\nso that they can combine\nany spontaneous visual\nhallucinations that occur\nwith the various thought\nprocesses that are\noccurring while\nunder the influence\nof psychedelics.\nThis is far and away different\nthan quote-unquote taking\nmushrooms and going\ninto the woods\nor taking mushrooms\nand going to the beach.\nWhat we're talking\nabout today is the use\nof psychedelics for particular\nbrain rewiring outcomes\nthat yes can involve things\nlike changing one's relationship\nto nature, or changing one's\nrelationship to somebody else\nby interacting with\nnature or somebody else.\nAnd while I'm not trying to\ndiminish the potential value\nof those sorts of\npsychedelic journeys,\nif we look at the scientific\ndata, the vast majority of it,\nnot just in the\nclinical setting,\nbut in terms of understanding\nthe safety, and efficacy,\nand positive rewiring\nof brain circuitry,\nthat allows people\nto feel better\nto understand themselves better\nand to interact with life\nin more adaptive\nways going forward\nout of the psychedelic\njourney involve these very,\nlet's say, subdued settings\nthat are typically in one room,\na closed environment with\none or two other individuals\nacting as guides or\nhelping the individual\nby talking to them from time\nto time if they feel like they\nhave to sort through\na particular aspect\nof the psychedelic journey\nthat's creating anxiety.\nAnd we'll talk about the contour\nof the psychedelic journey\nthat almost everyone\nwho takes psilocybin\nat somewhere between 20\nand 30 milligram dosages\ntends to experience.\nBut the setting\nthat I'm describing\nis not just a list of things\nto make sure you're safe,\nbut they're really\nthe list of things\nthat also ensure that one can\nget the maximum benefit out\nof the psilocybin journey.\nNow, other things included in\nsetting that are known, again,\nfrom scientific literature to\nbe very influential in terms\nof the experience that\none has and to bias\nthings towards a\npositive experience\nare, again, safety, eye mask,\nbut also the presence of music.\nNow, when I first heard about\nthis from one of the Premier\nresearchers on psilocybin\nand other psychedelics which\nis Robin Carhart-Harris,\nhe's a professor\nat University of California\nSan Francisco, who's\none of the major pioneers in\nthe studies of psychedelics.\nAnd when he first\nstarted telling me\nabout the critical\nrole that music plays,\nI thought, OK, that\nmakes sense you know.\nMusic can impact our emotion,\nimpact the way that we think,\nand could, therefore,\nimpact what one experiences\nduring the psychedelic journey.\nBut he really underscored for\nme the extent to which music\nis not just an incidental\nfeature of the setting\nin psychedelic set and\nsetting, but that it\nis one of the major drivers\nof the actual cognitive and\nemotional experience\nthat somebody\nhas on something like psilocybin\nthat allows the psilocybin\njourney to be looked at or\nviewed, not just as beneficial,\nbut, and this is quoted in the\nscientific literature as one\nof the most profound and\nimportant positive experiences\nthat one ever experienced\nin their life.\nSo let's talk about\nthe sorts of music\nthat have been used in\nthese clinical studies.\nWell, first of all,\nwe need to think\nabout how long the psilocybin\njourney itself is going to be.\nAnd the typical duration\nof the psilocybin journey\nis anywhere from 4 to 6 hours.\nIt's going to depend\nsomewhat on dose.\nIt's going to depend somewhat\non variability in people's liver\nmetabolism, and it's also\ngoing to depend somewhat\non how much food people\nhave in their gut.\nIn all the clinical\nstudies that I read,\nit was advised that people\nnot have any food in their gut\nat the time in which\nthey ingest or are\ninjected with the psilocybin.\nThat's particularly\ntrue if people\nare going to be taking\npsilocybin, mushrooms, in order\nto get their psilocybin.\nAnd that has been\ndone in a few studies.\nMost studies however\nuse synthetic psilocybin\ntaken orally.\nAgain, that's converted\nto psilocin in the gut\nby the acidity of the gut.\nAnd the acidity of\nthe gut is going\nto be impacted by the various\nfoods that people eat.\nAnd so that's one of the major\nreasons why people are advised\nto not eat for at\nleast four hours\nprior to the psilocybin journey.\nSo here we've got this 6\nhour, what we're calling,\njourney because that's what\neveryone calls it or trip.\nThat people start experiencing\nabout 30 to 45 minutes\nafter ingesting psilocybin\nor taking psilocybin.\nThere's a peak component\nin which there's\na maximal intensity of\nemotion and often that's\nalso associated with anxiety.\nAnd this is very\nimportant to understand.\nThe anxiety component\nis part of what\nin the therapeutic setting, they\nrefer to as ego dissolution.\nAnd that anxiety\naround the peak--\nand I think most people would\nprobably hear peak experience\nand think, oh, we're talking\nabout a peak positive\nexperience.\nBut no, we're referring to a\npeak experience and anxiety\nthat people stay with and\nthen come down from gradually\nas one goes from the\nsecond or third hour\nafter taking psilocybin.\nAnd that tapers off slowly\ntoward the 6-hour mark\nwhat, sometimes people refer\nto as parachuting back in.\nOf course, hopefully,\nI would very much\nhope people aren't\nactually parachuting back\nin while on psilocybin.\nBut I think you get the idea.\nThe music that's typically\nplayed in the clinical studies\nusing psilocybin for the\ntreatment of depression,\nor for compulsive\ndisorders, or addiction\ntends to have a\nparticular contour that\nmatches with and can also drive\nthat contour of the psilocybin\njourney that I just described.\nAgain, we're\ntalking about people\nwearing an eye mask\nwith guides present.\nSo people who are not taking\npsilocybin there as well\nto ensure that the person\nfeels supported and is safe.\nThe person is typically\nlying down, sometimes sitting\ndown, but more often\nthan not lying down,\nwearing an eye mask--\nand the music that's played at\nthe beginning of the psilocybin\nsession tends to be\nmusic that doesn't have\na lot of vocalizations,\nit tends to be\nthings like classical music, it\ntends to be fairly low volume.\nBut then transitions into music\nthat has a lot of percussion.\nSo often drums that\ntends to be higher\nvolume, that has a\nlot of intensity.\nAt about the time that one\nwould be experiencing the peak\nin emotion and perception, that\nso-called peak of the journey.\nThat intense music tends to\nbe played for about 45 minutes\nto 90 minutes, depending\non the study one looks at.\nAnd then tends to transition\ninto softer music, again.\nSometimes choral type or more\nmelodic music, often female\nvoices in particular,\nand then transition\ninto nature sounds and things\nthat more or less mimic\nthe outside natural\nworld and less so\nsynthetic things like drums, or\ninstruments, and vocalizations,\nand things of that sort.\nSo why would it be so\nimportant that music match\nand even contribute to\nthe subjective experience\nthat people have\non psychedelics?\nAnd here, we should probably\ntake a couple of moments,\nand just talk about what those\nsubjective experiences are\nlike.\nSo for people that haven't done\npsilocybin or any psychedelics,\nit's a little hard to describe.\nBut one way to describe\nit is that there's\na lot of so-called\nperceptual blending.\nSo, for instance,\npeople in the eye mask\nwill report seeing some\ngeometric shapes and colors.\nBut perhaps the music\nthey're listening\nto will then start to change\nthe intensity or the movement\nof whatever it is\nthat they're seeing,\nhallucinating inside of the eye\nmask in ways that are linked.\nThis is referred\nto as synesthesia\nor the merging of\ndifferent senses\nthat are not ordinarily merged.\nIn addition, people under\nthe influence of psilocybin\nor other psychedelics\nfor that matter\noften will report that\ntheir pattern of breathing\nbecomes linked to the\nperceptions of things\nthat they are hearing,\nor seeing, or feeling.\nSo, for instance, if they take\na big deep breath in and then\na long exhale out, they may\nfind that during a long exhale\nout, that the notes\nof music that they're\nhearing in those\nmoments are also\ndrawn out for the duration of\nthe breath in they'll inhale\nand that they're getting\nat least what they perceive\nas control over the\nmusic which, of course,\nthey are not\nactually controlling\nby using their breath.\nAnd that perhaps their\nvisual perceptions are also\nbeing merged with that.\nSo those are just a\ncouple of examples\nof how perceptual\nblending a.k.a.\nsynesthesia can occur\nwhile under the influence\nof psilocybin.\nAnd this really is highly\nindividual from one person\nto the next.\nSome people, for\ninstance, will find\nthat if they take their\nfingertips and rub them\nacross the couch or the\nchair that they happen\nto be lying down or sitting\non, that they will experience\na change in the music.\nMaybe even if they\nmove their hand up,\nthey hear an increase\nin frequency of sound.\nThey move their hand\ndown, they hear a decrease\nin frequency of sound.\nAnd all of this is linked\nto their emotional state\nat the same time and vice versa.\nSo we're talking about a lot\nof perceptual and emotional\nblending and some\nsense of control\nover one's perceptions\nand emotions\nin a way that's very\nunordinary, even extraordinary.\nWe can step back from all\nof this very subjective\ndescription of the\npsychedelic journey and ask,\nwhat is going on that would\nallow these sorts of things\nto occur?\nAnd there you are already\nequipped with an understanding\nof the cell biology\nand the chemistry that\nmakes all of this possible.\nAnd that is that when psilocybin\nis ingested and then converted\nto psilocin, it's the psilocin\nthat crosses the blood brain\nbarrier, and then\neven though psilocin\nlooks a lot like\nserotonin, psilocin\nhas this incredible ability\nto predominantly activate\nthe serotonin to a receptor.\nWell, we can understand\nmuch of what's\nhappening at a subjective level\nduring the psychedelic journey,\neven right down to\nthe sorts of emotions,\nand perceptual blending,\nthe synesthesia.\nWe can understand a lot\nof that by understanding\nwhere the serotonin 2A receptors\nare expressed on neurons,\nand what those particular\nneurons are doing.\nAnd the simplest\nway to describe this\nis that there's a\ncategory of neurons\nthat we call pyramidal neurons.\nPyramidal neurons are found\nlots of places in the brain.\nBut they're called\npyramidal neurons\nbecause they're sort of\nshaped like a pyramid.\nThey have a cell body, which\nis the part of the cell that\nhas the DNA in it and a lot\nof other important things\nlike the organelles,\nmitochondria, et cetera.\nAnd then they also have\nwhat are called dendrites.\nDendrites are the little\nbranches or processes\nthat reach out both from\nthe bottom of these cells.\nAnd then these\npyramidal cells are\ninteresting because they also\ngrow a branch up, up, up, up,\nup into layers of neural\ntissue above them.\nAnd they have what's\ncalled an apical branch.\nThat's the part that grows up.\nAnd then they fan\nout at the top.\nAnd that fanning out\nat the top allows\nthem to communicate with other\nneurons in their environment.\nSo if you're not getting a good\npicture of this in your mind\nfrom my description,\nI apologize.\nBut simply think about putting\nyour arms out to the side.\nAnd by doing that,\nyou're able to interact\nwith things that are some\ndistance from your body,\nan obvious thing in that case.\nThese cells are effectively\ndoing the same thing\nby extending little processes\nout into layers above them\nand to the sides.\nAnd this is really\nimportant because much\nof the serotonin to receptors\nthat are present on neurons\nin the brain are present\nin those apical dendrites,\nthose branches of\nthese pyramidal neurons\nthat are above and\nthat extend out\nto the side of those neurons.\nAnd so when somebody is under\nthe influence of psilocybin,\nthat means that psilocin\nhas bound to the receptors\non those apical dendrites.\nAnd it's increasing\nlateral communication\nacross brain areas.\nIn fact, this is\nperhaps one of the most\nwell-documented effects\nof psilocybin and other\npsychedelics, which\nis that there's\na shift from the brain\nbeing more modular,\nmeaning more segmented\nlike auditory neurons are\ncommunicating electrically\nand chemically largely\nwith other auditory neurons.\nOf course, they'll communicate\nwith other types of neurons,\ntoo, right?\nWhen I hear something off to my\nright, like a snap of a finger\nis off to the right,\nI'll turn my head.\nAnd my ability to do that\ndepends on my auditory neurons\nbeing linked up with\nthings like my motor\nsystem and my visual system.\nBut the key thing\nto understand is\nthat when there is psilocybin\npresent in one system,\nthat the communication of any\nof these pyramidal neurons,\nthe ones involved in hearing,\nthe ones involved in thinking,\nthe ones involved in\nmemory, the ones involved\nin visual perception\nor in the generation\nof visual hallucinations\nwith eyes closed,\nthose are all talking to many,\nmany more other neurons more\nextensively.\nSo what happens\neffectively is that there's\na reduction in the modularity,\nthe separateness of function\nin the brain, and an\nincrease in what's\ncalled integration\nof communication\nacross what would otherwise\nbe disparate brain regions.\nWe can say that really simply\nby saying psilocybin increases\ncommunication across the brain.\nNow, in addition\nto that, there's\na reduction in what's called\nthe hierarchical organization\nof the brain.\nTypically sensory\ninformation comes in\nfrom the outside environment.\nSo we hear something, we see\nsomething, we taste something,\nwe smell something.\nAnd in what's called a bottom\nup fashion meaning bottom\nfrom the periphery up,\nmeaning it propagates up\nthrough the eyes, through\nthe nose, through the ears\nthrough the skin, or the\nsenses in those regions,\nI should say, up into\nareas of the brain that\nsit deep to the cortex\nlike the thalamus.\nAnd then the thalamus\nis a way station,\nit's like a\nswitchboard that sends\nvisual stuff to\nthe visual centers,\nand auditory stuff to\nthe auditory centers,\nand touch stuff to\nthe touch centers,\nand things that maybe\ntrigger a memory off\nto the memory centers\nof the brain, et cetera.\nThat's the typical organization.\nIt's hierarchical because\nit goes from the periphery\nup to the more\ncomplex processing\nregions of the brain\nthat make decisions, that\nlink all of that stuff\nto prior experience,\nmaybe plans about the future.\nWhen psilocybin is\npresent in the system,\nthere's a broadening of the\nflow of that information\nfrom the bottom up as well.\nAnd that has to do with\nwhat's called thalamic gating.\nThe thalamus is a very\ninteresting structure.\nWe probably don't want to go\ninto it in too much detail\nright now.\nBut it really is\nlike a switchboard\nin a way station saying,\nhey, pay attention\nto the visual\nstuff, pay attention\nto the auditory stuff, or just\nto the visual and auditory\nstuff, and ignore touch\nsensation for the time being\nor vice versa.\nWhen psilocybin is\npresent in the system,\nand when serotonin 2A receptors\nare activated very strongly,\nthere's a tremendous broadening\nof the flow of information\nup and through the thalamus.\nSo not only is there\nmore communication\nof so-called higher\norder brain centers,\nwe refer to them as higher\norder because they're\ninvolved in thinking, and\ndecision making, and emotion,\net cetera.\nBut there's also a shift in\nthe flow of sensory information\ninto the brain\nthat can generally\nbe described as broader\nand including more blending\nof the different senses.\nAnd when I say\nblending of the senses,\nI'm also referring to blending\nof the sense of interoception\nof our sense of\nour body and what's\nhappening inside of our body.\nAnd this without\nquestion, at least\npartially explains when under\nthe influence of psilocybin,\none's breathing can\nbe linked to a sound,\nand then suddenly\nthe sound one thinks\nis being controlled\nby one's breathing,\nor that the sound itself can\nbe linked to something that we\nsee in our mind's eye\nwhile in the eye mask.\nEssentially, what\nI'm describing here\nis that serotonin to\na receptor activation\nallows for more broad, less\nprecise, and less hierarchical\nactivation of brain circuitry.\nAnd when I say\nhierarchical, what I mean\nis that normally things go\nfrom periphery, from eyes,\nto thalamus, to visual cortex.\nHowever, when under the\ninfluence of psilocybin,\nas I mentioned before,\neven in the eye mask,\nthe visual cortex is\ngoing to be very activated\neven in the absence\nof any visual input.\nSo then if one hears\na sound, perhaps\nfrom music, a particular\nmotif or voice,\nand that's linked to a\nparticular emotional state,\nthat is now being blended with\nvisual phenomenon occurring\nwithin the brain that\nhave no external stimulus.\nAnd so while the\npatterns of activation\nin the brain while under\nthe influence of psilocybin\naren't random, they are far less\nchanneled, far less modular,\nand far less hierarchical than\nwould ever be the case when\nnot under the\ninfluence of psilocybin\nI'd like to just\ntake a brief break\nand thank one of our\nsponsors, which is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of\nsalt, sodium, magnesium,\nand potassium, the so-called\nelectrolytes and no sugar.\nSalt, magnesium,\nand potassium, are\ncritical to the function of\nall the cells in your body,\nin particular, to the\nfunction of your nerve cells,\nalso called neurons.\nAnd we now know that\neven slight reductions\nin electrolyte concentrations\nor dehydration of the body\ncan lead to deficits in\ncognitive and physical\nperformance.\nLMNT contains a science\nbacked electrolyte ratio\nof 1000 milligrams.\nThat's 1 gram of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nI typically drink LMNT\nfirst thing in the morning\nwhen I wake up in order\nto hydrate my body\nand make sure I have\nenough electrolytes.\nAnd while I do any\nphysical training\nand after physical\ntraining as well,\nespecially if I've\nbeen sweating a lot,\nand certainly, I drink\nelement in my water when\nI'm in the sauna and\nafter going in the sauna\nbecause that causes\nquite a lot of sweating.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drink LMNT,\nthat's L-M-N-T.com/Huberman to\nclaim a free LMNT sample pack\nwith your purchase.\nAgain, that's drink LMNT,\nL-M-N-T.com/Huberman.\nNow in all fairness to\nthe scientific literature,\nthere are not one,\nnot two, not three,\nbut four prominent theories\nof which brain networks are\nmost activated\nduring a psilocybin\nor other psychedelic journey.\nAnd so for those of\nyou that are interested\nin those different models,\nfirst of all, please\nknow that they are\nnot competing models.\nWhile some of them disagree\nabout some of the details.\nIt's very likely that all\nof these models are true.\nThey include things like changes\nin the so-called default mode\nnetwork.\nThere's a lot of\ninterest in this.\nI've talked about it\nbefore on this podcast.\nThe default mode\nnetwork is the network\nin the brain that's\nthought to be responsible\nfor spontaneous imagination,\nfor daydreaming,\nand that reflects\nthe base activation\nstate of the brain when\nthere's no drugs in our system.\nAnd the default mode network is\none of the systems or networks\nrather that is\nthought to be required\nunder conditions of psilocybin\nor other psychedelics.\nAgain, if you're\ninterested in these models\nand comparing and\ncontrasting them,\nthere's a very nice review\nfrom Brian Roth's Lab\nat Duke entitled, The Neural\nBasis of Psychedelic Action.\nWe'll provide a link to this\nin the show note captions.\nAnd, again, I just\nwant to emphasize\nthat all of these models\nhave been shown to be\ntrue in different studies.\nAnd what they all point to is\nmore extensive communication\nbetween areas of the brain\nthat normally are not\nas active at the same time\nwhile under the influence\nof psychedelics,\nsuch as psilocybin.\nThe controversy in\nthe field relates\nto which of these networks is\nthe one that changes the most\nto explain the therapeutic\noutcomes that have been\ndiscovered in recent years.\nSo, again, check out that\nreview if you're interested\nand that sort of thing.\nIn the meantime, we\ncan cut a broad swath\nthrough all of those\nmodels, and just\nsay that psilocybin\nexpands the functional\nconnectivity of\nthe brain while one\nis under the influence\nof psilocybin.\nAnd it does seem that some\nof that expanded functional\nconnectivity persists after\nthe effects of psilocybin\nhave worn off.\nAnd that statement about\nthe functional connectivity\nof the brain being\nmore expanded,\nnot just during the psilocybin\nsession, but after as well,\nhas been substantiated\nin a number of papers.\nBut one of the key\npapers in this area\nis one that I recommend\npeople check out\nif they're interested\nin this sort of thing,\nis entitled, The Effects\nof Psilocybin and MDMA\non Between Network Resting\nState Functional Connectivity\nin Healthy Volunteers.\nAnd I like this paper\nfor a number of reasons.\nFirst of all, it's a\nvery high-quality paper\ncarried out in the laboratory\nof Robin Carhart-Harris at UCSF.\nAgain, one of the\nPremier researchers\nin this area of psychedelics\nand their function,\nwhat they do in\nthe brain, and also\ntheir therapeutic\napplications, but also\nbecause it focused on\nhealthy volunteers.\nThey explored using\nbrain imaging.\nWhat brain areas are\nactive in a resting state?\nSo things like\ndefault mode network.\nThen they had people\ntake psilocybin or MDMA.\nAnd then they looked\nat the connectivity\nbetween those brain areas\nin those same individuals\nwhen they were not under\nthe influence of these drugs\nand found more\nextensive connectivity.\nAll of which pointed to an\nenhanced lateral connectivity,\nless hierarchical\norganization effectively more\ninterconnection\nand communication\nbetween different brain areas.\nI think not only is the\nfact that they looked\nat healthy volunteers very\ninteresting and important,\nbut also that they looked\nat this resting state\nof the brain.\nThey weren't providing\na particular auditory\nor visual stimulus for\npeople to hear or look at\nwhile they were in the\nbrain imaging scanner\nas it's called rather,\nthey were simply\nlooking at how the brain\nwas behaving at rest.\nAnd so it's very clear that\nfor people that do two or even\njust one of these psilocybin\njourneys at a particular dose,\nthat the brain is\nactually getting rewired.\nWe hear this a lot.\nPsilocybin or other\npsychedelics lead to plasticity.\nThey rewire your brain.\nLet's go back to what we\nsaid at the beginning.\nRewiring of the brain\nis not the goal.\nAdaptive rewiring of the\nbrain is the goal, right?\nRewiring that leads to new\nideas that are interesting,\nthat are accessible after\nthe psychedelic journey.\nNew ideas and new ways of\nthinking or feeling that\nallow people to function\nbetter in their lives.\nThat's the goal of effective\npsychedelic therapies.\nNot simply rewiring\nof the brain.\nA brain injury for\nthat matter will\nlead to rewiring of the brain.\nBut that's maladaptive rewiring.\nThe use of things\nlike amphetamines\nor methamphetamines,\nin particular,\nwill lead to rewiring\nof the brain.\nBut that is strongly\nmaladaptive rewiring\nSo now, there are really\ndozens of studies conducted\nin humans using brain\nimaging and other techniques\nhave evaluated how\nthings like psilocybin\nchange connectivity\nin the brain.\nAnd I think the\ntake home message is\nit expands that connectivity.\nHowever, it seems\nto do so in ways\nthat still allow people to\nfunction in their daily lives.\nAnd one of the key things that\nI gleaned from the literature\non the therapeutic\nuse of psilocybin\nfor the treatment\nof depression is\nthat very seldom, do people\nwho take psilocybin experience\nlong-term issues with memory.\nWhy is that so critical?\nWell, you could imagine\nthat increasing connectivity\nin the brain\nreducing modularity,\nreducing hierarchical\norganization of the brain\nwould lead to disruptions\nin memory, right?\nIt's as if you're shuffling\nbooks on the bookshelf\nso to speak.\nBut that doesn't\nseem to be the case.\nRather it seems that the\nincrease in connectivity\nis leading provided set\nand setting are correct,\nprovided safety\nprotocols are followed\nto positive rewiring or adaptive\nrewiring of neural tissue.\nSo that's one of the\nthings that makes\npsychedelics and\npsilocybin, in particular,\nvery exciting from the\ntherapeutic standpoint.\nAnd of course, we\nhave to acknowledge\nit's also it has a lot of people\nexcited about psychedelics, not\njust for the treatment\nof depression,\nbut for expanding the brain's\ncapabilities more generally.\nSo along those lines,\nI want to touch\non the issues of creativity\nand the experience\nof life outside of\npsychedelic journeys\nis impacted by\npsychedelic journeys.\nAnd here this relates to a\nquestion that I heard a lot.\nWhen I put the call\nout on social media\nthat I was going to do this\nepisode, and I asked people,\nwhat do you want to\nknow about psilocybin?\nAnd one of the more common\nquestions that I got was,\ndoes it increase creativity?\nDoes it increase our\nexperience of life\nin ways that are beneficial\naside from its now documented\npositive effects in\ntreating depression\nand compulsive\ndisorders and addiction?\nAnd the short answer\nto this is yes.\nBut that the positive\neffects of psychedelics,\npsilocybin, in\nparticular, on creativity,\nand our experience\nof life have only\nbeen explored in a fairly\nnarrow set of dimensions.\nHowever, where\nit's been explored,\nthere's some really\ninteresting findings.\nSo one of the more\ninteresting findings\nI think is a paper entitled\nincreased low frequency brain\nresponses to music\nafter psilocybin therapy\nfor depression.\nI think this is a really\ninteresting paper.\nBecause what the authors did is\nthey took advantage of the fact\nthat in these therapeutic\npsilocybin sessions\nthat were carried out for\nthe treatment of depression,\nmusic is being played.\nAnd there are prior\nstudies showing\nthat when music is played,\nyou activate different brain\nareas depending on what\nmusic is being played.\nIt's somewhat obvious perhaps.\nSad music versus intense.\nYou can think about heavy\nmetal, versus choir music,\nversus Gregorian chants,\nversus punk rock music,\nand on, and on.\nIt makes sense that\ndifferent brain areas\nwould be activated when\ndifferent patterns of music\nare played.\nHowever, there do seem to\nbe some universal features\nof brain activation\nin response to music.\nThis should probably be the\ntopic of an entire episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd indeed it will be.\nFor instance, there are\nareas of the auditory cortex\nthat are activated.\nNo surprise there.\nAnd areas of the brain's\nreward circuitry,\nthe so-called ventral striatum\nand the so-called mesolimbic\nreward pathway.\nI talked a lot about these in\nthe episodes about dopamine\nthat I've done previously.\nThese are brain areas that\nlead to the release of dopamine\nin other brain areas, and that\nreinforce certain experiences,\nand that tend to give us the\nsubjective feeling of, yes, I\nlike this.\nI want more.\nSo in this particular\npaper, what the authors did\nis they took\nadvantage of the fact\nthat people are in the\nclinic, they're on psilocybin,\nthey're listening to music.\nAnd as you recall,\nthe music played\nat different stages of\nthe psilocybin journey\nare different.\nThey have a different\nemotional component.\nAnd music is a really nice\nstimulus in the laboratory\nas we say.\nBecause like with\nvisual stimuli,\nyou can break it down into\nhigh frequency, low frequency.\nSounds like dum, dum, or ah, ah.\nThese kinds of things\nthat was my attempt\nat low frequency versus high\nfrequency auditory stimuli.\nOr at the spatial frequency,\nor what in the auditory domain\nwould be called the\ntemporal frequency\nis it boom, boom, boom.\nOr is it boom, boom, boom, boom.\nAll we've changed there\nis the temporal frequency.\nThe sound was somewhat\nthe same, but the distance\nbetween those sounds\nwas different.\nYou get the idea.\nSo they have access\nto these people\nand these different conditions.\nAnd they can put them\nin the brain scanner.\nAnd they can do that before and\nafter having taken psilocybin.\nAnd the long and\nshort of this study\nis that psilocybin changes one's\nexperience of music, not just\nduring the psilocybin journey\nitself, but thereafter.\nAnd, in fact, it changes\none's emotional response\nto music in very\ninteresting ways.\nFor instance, one of\nthe more common features\nof major depression\nis that people\ndon't derive as much\npleasure from different types\nof experiences,\nwhether or not it's\nfood, or sex, or social\nexperiences to the point where\nsometimes they just stop trying\nto seek out those experiences.\nPeople with depression often\nfeel as if music no longer\nhas the same impact.\nIt just doesn't really\nlift them up very much.\nThis study found that people\nwho have taken psilocybin,\naccording to the parameters\nwe talked about earlier,\ncan get a return of the\nelevated emotionality,\nthe positive emotions associated\nwith music that formerly\nmade them feel good.\nIn other words, they\ncan feel music again.\nThey can feel good in\nresponse to music again.\nNow, this is interesting\nbecause, in theory, it\ncould be that psilocybin\nsimply allowed\nthem to access the emotions\naround music, again,\nmore generally.\nBut that's actually\nnot what this paper\nand some other papers that\nhave been published report.\nRather, it seems that\ntaking psilocybin\ncan increase one's positive\nperception of music\nthat one likes and can\ntone down or reduce\nthe depressiveness or\nthe sadness of music that\ntends to make one sad, even\nafter the psilocybin has\nworn off and for a long\nperiod of time afterwards.\nMaybe even forever.\nAlthough no study, of course,\ncan be carried out forever\nbecause forever is forever.\nWhat we do know, however,\nis that psilocybin\ncan rewire the connections\nbetween the emotion centers\nin the brain and the\nnetworks that control\nauditory perception of music.\nAnd leads to this\ncondition in which people\nwho felt like, I was depressed,\nor I couldn't feel the music,\nI just wasn't getting the same\nlift and joy from it again,\nthey can start to experience\nmore joy from that music again.\nAnd that music that made\nthem feel sad and depressed\nhas a diminished\ncapacity to make\nthem feel sad and depressed.\nAnd there's a lot\nof neuroimaging data\nin this paper that point to\nthe specific brain areas that\ninclude areas like the\nventral tegmental area that\ncan explain why these sorts\nof effects would occur.\nSo this isn't just subjective\nreports of people saying,\noh, yeah, I was depressed.\nAnd music didn't feel really\ngood and now it feels great.\nOr that used to\nmake me feel so sad.\nAnd now, I feel like\nI have a capacity\nto listen to that without being\ncrushed by feelings of sadness.\nThe paper included\nsome subjective reports\nof that sort.\nBut then was able to link those\nto changes in brain circuitry\nand brain activation in response\nto music using neuroimaging.\nSo in that way, it really\npoints to both the subjective,\nand structural, and\nfunctional changes\nthat psilocybin can bring\nabout through that expanded\nconnectivity\nbetween brain areas.\nBecause remember during\nthe psilocybin session,\nit's not as if music or\nthe perception of music\nis specifically being looked at\nor focused on in these studies,\nrather music is playing.\nPeople are in the\neye mask, they're\nfeeling all sorts of\nthings, they're breathing,\nthey're hearing their touch.\nIt's all happening all at once.\nThere's a peak.\nIt's long.\nThere's a long taper.\nThe music's changing.\nOK.\nAll of that took place\nin this study as well.\nBut it is after the session\nwhen comparing brain activation\nstates to music of a\nparticular type, sad or happy.\nAnd comparing that to the\npatterns of brain activation\nthat occurred before\nthe psilocybin journey\nthat they discover\nthat people's brains\nhave rewired during\nthe psilocybin session\nin a way that allows\nthem to experience joy\nin response to music again.\nSo that's one of the\nmore rigorous studies\nI was able to find.\nThat addresses this question\nof whether or not psilocybin\nreally does rewire\nthe brain in ways\nthat allows us to\nbe more creative\nand experienced life differently\nafter the psilocybin session.\nNow, that paper didn't focus\nspecifically on creativity.\nI did an entire\nepisode on creativity\nthat talked about different\ntypes of meditation,\nlike open monitoring\nmeditation, it\ntalked about different\npatterns of thinking\nthat one can actually practice\nto increase creativity.\nWe had arguably one of the most\ncreative people on the planet.\nRick Rubin came on\nthis podcast talked\nabout the creative process\nfrom the perspective of music\nand his role in producing music.\nSo you can check\nout those episodes\nif you're interested in the\nneural circuitry related\nto creativity.\nAt least at the time of\nrecording this episode.\nThere haven't been a lot of\nstudies looking specifically\nat the brain networks\nthat we think\nare involved in\ncreativity and how\nthose change in response\nto psilocybin and other\npsychedelics.\nI imagine those studies\nare either happening now\nor will happen in the future.\nBut the studies I just\ndescribed referring\nto the changes in emotionality\nand responses to music,\nI think provide a nice\ntemplate for what's\nlikely happening both\nduring psilocybin journeys\nand after those\npsilocybin journeys.\nWhen we talk about less\nhierarchical organization,\nmore connectivity between brain\nareas, what it's pointing to\nis the fact that during\nthe psilocybin journey,\npeople have the\nopportunity to learn\nnew relationships between\ndifferent sensory and emotional\nstates.\nAnd those new relationships\nseem to persist\nlong after the psychedelic\njourney has been finished.\nAnd a lot of people\nresearching psilocybin\nin the clinical setting\nthink that that's\none of the major reasons\nwhy psilocybin and other\npsychedelics can rewire our\nrelationship to things more\nbroadly.\nIt allows for new learning,\nnew contingencies.\nAnd when we look at depression,\nwe often think diminished mood,\npeople don't have an\nappetite, they're not\ninterested in social\nrelationships,\nor romantic relationships.\nThey're really struggling.\nAnd all of that,\nof course, is true.\nBut another lens to look\nat depression through\nis that a lot of that\nthinking and a lot\nof those emotional\nstates that are negative\nare somewhat habitual.\nThey relate to\nimplicit understanding\nand living out of the\nidea that A leads to B\nleads to C. You seek\nout a relationship,\nit doesn't work out.\nTry a new job, you\ndon't get the job.\nYou get the job, it's no good.\nAll these negative outcomes\nof if A, then B, then C.\nAnd it does seem\nthat psilocybin can\nhave this effect of invoking\nnew patterns of learning.\nNew considerations about\nwhat might be possible.\nAnd indeed, may even lead to\nactual rewiring of the emotion\ncenters in the brain with these\nother brain areas and vice\nversa in ways that eject people\nfrom the psilocybin session\nthinking, oh, yeah, I used to\nfeel this way about something,\nwork, relationships,\nmyself, et cetera.\nBut I'm willing to consider\nthis other possibility.\nOr this other possibility\nseems at least partially\ntrue to the extent that I'm\nwilling to go out and evaluate\nthat.\nNow, here I'm speaking\nvery subjectively.\nBut remember, we have to tie\nback the subjective experiences\nand changes of\nthings like music,\nand emotion, and our\nrelationship to life,\nand jobs, and relationships\nback to the cell biology\nand chemistry of psilocybin.\nBecause, ultimately, it\nreally is just a chemical\nactivating receptors.\nThose receptors changing\nnetworks in the brain.\nAnd the journey\nitself seems to be\nthe time when all of those\nchanges are put in motion.\nIt's like a boulder\nthat gets rolling.\nIn fact, I think the best\nway to think about psilocybin\nand other psychedelics\nis that they initiate\nthe neuroplasticity\nprocess, but they are not\nthe neuroplasticity\nprocess itself.\nAnd the journey itself is not\nwhere all the neuroplasticity\noccurs.\nWe know that for sure.\nIn fact, if you\nwant to imagine how\npsilocybin and other\npsychedelics work\nto change the brain,\nthink about them\nas a wedge that gets\nunderneath the boulder, that\nis the neuroplasticity\nthat gets rolling forward.\nAnd then think\nabout whether or not\nthe plasticity is adaptive or\nmaladaptive, whether or not\nit actually serves you in\nyour life on a daily basis,\nor not, depending\non whether or not\nyou're using your\nconscious brain to move\nthat Boulder in a\nparticular direction.\nNot just bulldozing through\nthings and destroying them,\nbut clearing a path through\nold ineffective maybe,\neven destructive patterns\nof thoughts, or emotions, et\ncetera.\nI give you that\nanalogy because I\nthink it more accurately\ncaptures what psychedelics\nlike psilocybin are doing.\nRather than the typical\ndiscussion around\npsychedelics that we tend\nto hear which is that, oh,\nit creates plasticity.\nAnd plasticity is what you want.\nFor the next couple\nof minutes, I'd\nlike to focus on some of\nthe key and stereotype that\nis characteristic experiences\nthat people tend to have\nduring a psilocybin journey.\nBecause there's some really\ninteresting research on this.\nThese are phrases that\nperhaps you've heard before.\nThings like letting\ngo, ego dissolution,\nfeelings of connectedness.\nWell, all of that is very\nsubjective on the one hand.\nThose words are heard often\nenough and repeatedly enough\nin psilocybin sessions and\nafter psilocybin sessions,\nalong with this description\nof the psilocybin\nexperience as one of the\nmost profound of one's life,\nor one of the most positive in\nthe ideal case of one's life\nthat they are worth exploring.\nWe should also, of course,\nexplore the so-called bad trip,\nthe possibility\nthat someone will\nhave a not good time or even\nvery frightening time while\nunder the influence\nof psilocybin.\nSo there have been\nsome scientific studies\nthat have explored what sorts\nof subjective experiences.\nThat is thoughts, and feelings,\ninsights that people have,\nthat relate to positive\ntherapeutic outcomes,\nand more generally\nwith the sense\nthat the psilocybin journey\nwas positive or maybe\neven tremendously\npositive in one's life.\nSo while there's\na century or more\nof writings about\npsychedelics that\ndescribe things like enhanced\nfeelings of connectedness,\nor dissolution of the ego,\nthe loss of one sense of self,\nand then the regaining of\none's sense of self, and so on.\nThere's a particular\npaper that describes\nsome of those things in\nterms of rating scales, that\nis the sorts of tests that\npeople can take in which they\nanswer particular questions,\nand that link back to things\nlike feelings of connectedness\nand ego dissolution,\nthat allows us to put\nsome numbers to those m\nand to look at some of\nthe statistics associated\nwith those experiences.\nAnd this is really\nwhat's important\nabout scientific\nstudies, whether or not\na measure is subjective.\nSo if someone's self-reporting,\nhow they felt or feel,\nor whether or not it's\nmeasure of blood pressure,\nor of a chemical in the\nbloodstream, et cetera.\nIt's the use of\nnumbers and statistics\nthat allows comparison\nbetween different groups.\nAnd that can be\ncompared between studies\nthat allows us to make some\nfirm conclusions about what\nsorts of things psilocybin\nmay or may not be doing\nwhen it's effective or not.\nSo the paper I'd\nlike to highlight\nis entitled quality of\nacute psychedelic experience\npredicts therapeutic efficacy\nof psilocybin for treatment\nresistant depression.\nI'll put a link to this paper\nin the show note captions.\nBut the basic\ncontour of this paper\nis that they looked at\nsubjects that underwent two\ndifferent psilocybin sessions.\nOne, at a relatively\nlow ish dose\nof 10 milligrams of psilocybin.\nAnd that would be\nequivalent to about 1 gram\nof psychedelic\nmushrooms more or less.\nAnd a second session\ninvolving subjects\ntaking 25 milligrams\nof psilocybin,\nor what's roughly\nequivalent to somebody\ntaking 2.5 grams of\npsilocybin mushrooms.\nThose people then\nanswered what's\ncalled the altered states of\nconsciousness questionnaire,\nwhich allowed them to address.\nAnd here I'm\nparaphrasing the quality\nof experiences in the 25\nmilligrams psilocybin session.\nSo without going\ninto too much detail,\nit's often the case in\nthese two session studies\nthat subjects will take\na slightly lower dose\nof psilocybin, to familiarize\nthemselves with the experience.\nAnd then the higher\ndose that leads\nto the more intense experience.\nIntense meaning a bigger, more\nintense peak, a longer session\noverall, greater\ndistortions in emotionality,\nand perceptual\nexperience, all the stuff\nwe talked about before.\nSo what this study found is\nthat one of the key features,\nif not, the key feature of\na positive quote-unquote\npsychedelic experience\nis this sense\nof oceanic boundlessness\noccurring at some point\nduring the psychedelic journey.\nNow, oceanic boundlessness\ndoesn't necessarily\nmean anything to any of us.\nIt probably means different\nthings to different people.\nIs this idea that one is\nexperiencing something\nextremely unusual, even mystical\nbeyond this world and one's\nnormal experience.\nBut that it's not aligned\nwith any specific outcome\nin the moment.\nIt's not directly attached to\nany one feeling, or memory,\nor thought process.\nIt's a little bit\ntough to describe\nbecause I can guarantee you.\nI'm not on psilocybin or\nany psychedelics right now.\nAnd I can only imagine\nthat you're not.\nAlthough some of you might be.\nI can't even imagine\nwhat this podcast\nwould be like for somebody\non psilocybin at this moment.\nBut in any case,\noceanic boundlessness,\na feeling of the\nexperience being mystical,\nand not really heading in\nany one particular direction.\nJust a feeling of massive\nconnectedness with one's\nenvironment both in\nthe room and session.\nPerhaps with the guides with\noneself, with one's past,\nwith one's present,\npeople outside the room\nwith the entire world,\nmaybe even the universe,\nthat sort of thing.\nThe intensity of that experience\nof oceanic boundlessness,\nthe mystical experience seems\nto be positively correlated\nwith positive\ntherapeutic outcomes.\nThat is relief from\nmajor depression.\nNow, during the\npsychedelic journey,\nas we talked about\nbefore, there are\na number of steps that one\ntypically goes through.\nSo there's the build up\nto first experiencing\nthe effects of the\ndrug about maybe\n20 to 45 minutes into\nthe journey or trip.\nThen the peak.\nAnd it is during that\npeak that people often\nfeel the sense of\noceanic boundlessness.\nHowever, it's also\noften the case\nthat it is during the peak\nor the maximum intensity\nof emotion.\nAnd we know based on\ndirect measurements\nalso increases in blood\npressure and heart rate often\nvery significant increases\nin anxiety and fear as well,\nthat people will experience\nthings like ego dissolution.\nAnd the guide's\nrole at that point\nis, of course, to\nkeep the person safe,\nmake sure they don't run out of\nthe room, jump out of a window,\nrun into traffic.\nSadly, these are\nthings that have\nhappened outside of a strong,\nhealthy, safe set and setting.\nBut the guide's role is\nto keep the person safe,\nbut also to encourage\nthem to let go and move\nthrough that experience\nto experience the anxiety,\nallow it to peak, allow\nthem to see that they're not\ngoing to die from that anxiety,\nthey're not going to dissolve.\nThey won't lose their\nsense of self completely,\nor they may temporarily\nfeel as if they\nlose their sense of self.\nBut then they feel it\nrestored at various intervals\nduring the peak or as\nthey exit that peak\nand move toward the say second,\nthird, fourth, fifth hour\nof the session.\nSo when exactly these feelings\nof oceanic boundlessness\nand ego dissolution occur?\nIt varies from person to person.\nBut typically, it's\nduring the peak\nthat the ego dissolution,\nthe fear, and the need\nto quote-unquote let\ngo is most typical.\nI think perhaps the best\nway to describe the data\nin this paper in a way that's\nmeaningful to everybody\nis to refer you\nto figure 2, which\nif you're not\nlooking at the paper,\nwon't mean anything to you.\nBut I'll describe it.\nAnd if you do want to take\na look at figure 2 again,\nyou can access the paper\nin the show note captions.\nWhat they did is they\nlooked at a number\nof different subjective\nmeasures, things\nlike experience of\nunity, the feeling\nthat one is connected to\nothers and to the world.\nThings like spirituality,\nwhether or not\nthe whole thing felt like\na spiritual experience,\nwhether or not it was a\nblissful state, whether or not\nthere were insights, whether or\nnot somebody felt disembodied\nout of body, whether or not\nsomebody had a lot of anxiety,\nwhether or not they had these\nsynesthesia, these blending\nof visual, auditory, touch,\nand breathing, and things\nof that sort.\nAnd they addressed,\nwhich of those measures\nrelated to the positive\nclinical outcomes that\nwere observed later after\nthe psilocybin wore off.\nAnd while I'm not\ngoing to go point\nby point through each\none of these measures,\nthere's a general feature to\nemerge from the study, which\nis that the experience of unity,\nthe sense that the psilocybin\njourney was spiritual,\nan experience of bliss\nat some point inside of\nthe psilocybin journey.\nThe sense that\nthere were insights,\nthat there were learnings about\none's life and one's self.\nWhen those things were\nexperienced very strongly,\nthat correlated with\nthe person being\nwhat was called a responder\nto the psilocybin treatment,\nmeaning they got relief\nfrom their depression.\nWhereas people who\nfelt less of that--\nOK, so the non-responders\nas they're called,\nthe people who do\nnot benefit so much\nin the long run from\nthe psilocybin treatment\ntended to report less of\nan experience of unity,\nless of a spiritual experience,\nless of a blissful state,\nless insightfulness, and so on.\nWhereas there were very few\ndifferences between the people\nthat derived benefit from the\npsilocybin treatment and those\ndid not along the\ndimensions of synesthesia,\nthis blending of\ndifferent perceptions\nthat ordinarily doesn't\noccur for most people.\nOr complex imagery, right?\nPut simply everyone who took\npsilocybin in this study at 25\nmilligrams saw a\ncomplex imagery,\nthey saw a lot of\nhallucinations.\nBut just seeing\nhallucinations did not\nlead to the positive clinical\noutcomes in terms of mood.\nAnxiety was a very\ninteresting measure here.\nBecause ordinarily, we think\nof the ego dissolution,\nthe letting go is\nsuch a key component\nof the psychedelic\njourney in terms\nof the positive\ntherapeutic outcomes.\nThis has been\ndiscussed quite a lot.\nAnd in full disclosure,\nRobin Carhart-Harris\nhas already come on to record\nan episode of The Huberman Lab\npodcast.\nThat episode hasn't\nbeen released yet,\nbut it will be released soon.\nAnd he talks about\nthe importance\nof this letting go in terms of\nthe positive clinical outcomes\nof the psilocybin journey.\nAnd indeed that is true.\nAnd I should also mention\nthat Dr. Matthew Johnson\nfrom Johns Hopkins who also\nruns a laboratory exploring\npsychedelics and their\nrole in treating things\nlike eating disorders,\nand depression, et cetera.\nAlso, doing incredible work.\nAlso talked about the\nimportance of letting\ngo during the\npsilocybin journey.\nThis ego dissolution,\nthis ability\nto move through the anxiety.\nAnd, again, I can't\nunderscore this enough\nbecause it's been told\nto me over and over again\nby the top researchers\nin this area.\nThat people head into that\npeaking phase of the psilocybin\njourney, and oftentimes it\nis not pleasant for them,\nthey're feeling like it's\nuncomfortable, it's scary,\nand their heart rate is up,\nand their blood pressure is up,\nand they're having a\nhard time calming down,\nand they want to calm down.\nBut it does seem that while the\nguides should not ramp them up\nand get them more\nstressed, that the ability\nto move through that\nstressful period\nto somewhat guide oneself or to\nbe encouraged to guide oneself\nthrough that peak.\nAnd that anxiety and the\nfear of losing oneself\nand the so-called ego\ndissolution that occurs\nis an important feature for an\neffective therapeutic session.\nIn this study, anxiety\nitself was inversely\ncorrelated with a positive\ntherapeutic outcome.\nSo this is important\nand somewhat nuanced.\nOn the one hand, I'm telling\nyou that the letting go,\nthe ego dissolution\ndoes seem to be\nimportant in terms of reporting\na psychedelic experience\nas effective as having\naccomplished something.\nAnd perhaps even explaining\nsome of the long-term positive\neffects to emerge from\nthat psychedelic journey.\nIn this case,\npsilocybin journey.\nHowever, non-responders,\nthat is people\nwho did psilocybin,\nbut did not have\na positive therapeutic\noutcome in comparison\nto the responders,\nthose non-responders\ntended to have higher\nsubjective ratings of anxiety\nthan did the responders.\nSo this is important.\nAnd what it speaks\nto is the fact\nthat while yes letting\ngo during the session,\nexperiencing some anxiety,\nperhaps even ego dissolution,\nand the dissolving of self,\nand then the return of self\nis important.\nIt is also important it seems\nthat anxiety not be so, so high\nor subjectively\nexperienced as so high.\nThat one does not experience\nthe positive neuronal rewiring\nthat leads to a more\npervasive elevated mood.\nSo I'm definitely\nsaying two things at\nonce because I'm trying to\ncapture the data accurately.\nIt would not be fair for me to\nsay, just let go, experience\nas much anxiety as is possible.\nAnd that's part of the process.\nYes.\nLetting go-- again,\nin air quote seems\nto be important for\none's experience\nof the psychedelic journey, in\nparticular, around the peak.\nThat occurs about\ntwo hours in or so.\nHowever, extreme\nlevels of anxiety\nseem inversely correlated\nor negatively correlated\nwould be the better\nway to put it\nwith the positive\ntherapeutic outcome or relief\nfrom depression.\nSo this takes us back\nto all of the things\nwe've been talking\nabout thus far.\nNot just the chemistry\nand biological action\nof psilocybin, but\nthe key importance\nof getting dosage right, the\nkey importance of making sure\nthat you're in a\nsafe environment,\nbut also one in which the guides\nreally know what they're doing.\nI think this is one of the\nbiggest and most important\nreasons for having well-trained\nguides who really understand\nthe contour of the\npsychedelic journey,\nbut are also trained\nin how to help somebody\nwith their anxiety in\nreal-time while they're\nunder the effects of psilocybin.\nAnd, of course, to help people\nintegrate those feelings\nof high anxiety and\nmaybe guide them\nback down to a calmer state\nduring the psychedelic session\nitself.\nAnd here I can just mention some\nunpublished data and studies.\nAnd, again, these\nare very preliminary.\nBut through discussions with\nDr. Matthew Johnson who's\nrunning these psilocybin\nand other sorts\nof psychedelic trials\nat Johns Hopkins,\nhe and I discussed\nthe importance\nof having a real-time tool\nto adjust to anxiety while\nunder the influence of\npsychedelics like psilocybin.\nAnd there he asked, and\nthey've started to incorporate,\nas my understanding, some of\nthe real-time respiration tools\nthat is breathing tools\nthat we know based on work\nin my laboratory, Dr.\nDavid Spiegel's laboratory,\ncan reduce anxiety very\nquickly in real-time.\nAnd that involves the use of the\nso-called physiological sigh.\nI've talked a lot about this\nbefore on previous podcasts.\nSo rather than explain\nit to you again here now,\nwe'll put a link to\nthe physiological sigh.\nI do a demonstration of it\nin the show note captions.\nI'll also link to a recent\npaper that we published\nin Cell Reports Medicine.\nThis was a collaborative\nwork that my laboratory\ndid with Dr. David\nSpiegel's laboratory\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nShowing that the\nphysiological size\namong the different deliberate\nrespiration techniques, one\nof the fastest and\nmost effective ways\nto reduce levels of\nautonomic arousal a.k.a.\nanxiety or stress.\nAnd Dr. Matthew\nJohnson's laboratory\nhas started to incorporate\nphysiological size\nwithin these psychedelic\nsessions as a tool\nthat the guides can refer people\nto before the session begins,\nteaching it to them.\nSo they realize they\ncan calm themselves\ndown if necessary in real-time.\nIt works the first time,\nit works every time.\nThis is not because it's some\nmagic breathing technique\nthat I created.\nIt certainly is not.\nThis is a naturally\noccurring pattern\nof breathing that occurs\nin sleep and in waking.\nBut that when done\ndeliberately, leads\na very rapid and\nquite significant\ndecreases in stress and anxiety.\nAnd then when people are inside\nof the psychedelic session,\nif they feel their anxiety\nlevels are going too high,\nthey're heading toward\nwhat might be called\na quote-unquote bad trip.\nThey're starting\nto panic or really\nthink they're going to\nhave a panic attack or die.\nAgain, the subjective\nexperience is\ngoing to be layered on top of\nthe physiological experience\nof one's heart rate\nbeing really elevated,\nsaw a stress and agitation.\nBy using the\nphysiological sigh inside\nof the psychedelic session,\nDr. Johnson's laboratory.\nAnd I believe, at least\none other laboratory\nare starting to use\nbreathing techniques\nsuch as the physiological\nsigh as a way\nfor these people who are under\nthe influence of psilocybin\nto self-direct their own calm.\nAnd to bring that\nlevel of anxiety\ndown so that they can continue\nto move through the peak\nand move through\nthe other phases\nof the psychedelic\njourney in ways that could\nbe most beneficial for them.\nSo to close out the description\nof this really wonderful\nstudy--\nand by the way, it's another\none from the Carhart-Harris\nlaboratory, about the subjective\nexperience of ego dissolution\nor oceanic boundlessness,\nthis mystical state\nas so key as a component of a\npositive psilocybin journey.\nI'll just read for you the\nfinal sentence of this paper\nbecause it captures it so well.\nQuote, it seems vital that\nappropriate consideration\nis paid to the importance of\npromoting a certain experience\nas the quality of\nthat experience\nmay be the critical determinant\nof therapeutic success.\nNow, before we\nmove into what will\nbe a very brief\ndescription of some\nof the other rewiring\nphenomena, that psilocybin\ncan induce, and then into some\nof the therapeutic applications\nof psilocybin as they relate\nto these recent really exciting\nclinical trials for depression,\nand addictive disorders,\nand things of that sort.\nI just want to cue\neverybody to a paper\nthat I think many\npeople will want\nto take a look at in\nthinking about psilocybin.\nAnd I'll provide a\nlink to this paper\nas well in the\nshow note captions.\nThis paper is entitled\ntherapeutic use\nof psilocybin,\npractical considerations\nfor dosing and administration.\nAnd this is a wonderful\npaper because it really\ngoes step by step through the\npharmacology of psilocybin\nof which you now\nunderstand a bit.\nBut it goes into\na bit more detail.\nBut then it also\nreally nicely describes\nthe contour of a\npsilocybin session\nand what's happening at\nthe level of chemistry\nearly, middle, peak, and toward\nthe end of the psilocybin\nsession.\nAnd then also\nimportantly, it gets\ninto issues of dosage\nand translating\nfrom mushrooms, to psilocybin\nitself, to psilocybin,\nthings I talked about earlier.\nBut in a bit more detail, if\nyou'd like to see that detail.\nAnd then perhaps\nmost importantly,\nthere's a section on\ncontraindications where\nit points out that\nof course, women\nwho are pregnant\nor breastfeeding,\npeople who have a\npredisposition to psychosis,\nthose people should\nreally avoid the use\nof psilocybin and other\npsychedelics entirely.\nIt also talks about where the\nevidence is strong, moderate,\nand weak for the use of\npsilocybin for treatment\nof various disorders.\nAnd I can just summarize\nthat very quickly\nbecause it's where we're going\nto head in a few minutes, which\nis that the most evidence for\npositive therapeutic outcomes\nin response to psilocybin taken\nand conducted in the manner\nthat we've been describing today\nin terms of dosage, and journey\nset, and setting is for\ncancer-related depression,\ncancer-related anxiety, and\ntreatment resistant depression.\nThat's where most of\nthe evidence resides.\nThere's also some evidence for\nthe use of psilocybin journeys.\nAnd, again, this is typically\none or two psilocybin journeys\nspaced in the cases of\ntwo journeys anywhere\nfrom one to two weeks apart.\nAnd, again, with all\nof the same contour\nof supports and set\nand setting that we've\nbeen talking about today.\nAnd there there's some\nevidence for improvement\nin terms of outcomes in alcohol\nuse disorder, and dependence,\nand tobacco addiction.\nAnd then finally, there's\nthe least amount of evidence.\nAlthough there is clinical\ntrial support for relief\nor partial relief for\nobsessive compulsive disorder,\ncluster headaches and\nmigraines, and demoralization\ndue to AIDS diagnosis.\nSo this paper has a lot of\nreally interesting information\nin terms of different\nconditions, in terms of dosage,\nand again,\ncontraindications, and what's\ncalled adverse events,\nwhat sorts of bad things\ncan and do happen as a\nconsequence of psilocybin\nand other types of\npsychedelic journeys\nboth during and after those\npsilocybin or psychedelic\nsessions.\nAnd we'll talk a\nbit more about this\nwhen we go into some of\nthose clinical studies.\nBecause adverse\nreactions is always\na key measure in\nany clinical study.\nSo very soon, we'll get into\nthe more recent clinical studies\nrelated to psilocybin for the\nuse of treating depression\nand some other conditions.\nBut before we do\nthat, I'd be remiss\nif I didn't talk about how\npsilocybin does and does not\nchange the brain, what is and\nwhat is not known about that.\nIn fact, when I put out the call\nfor questions about psilocybin,\nmany of the questions\nrelated to these issues.\nThe first thing to understand\nis that a psilocybin journey\nis really a way to try and put\nthat wedge under the boulder\nas I described it to try\nand invoke neuroplasticity\nof a particular kind.\nAnd in that way,\nit's remarkable,\nif you think about it, that\neveryone has different lives\ndifferent experiences.\nPsychedelics, in\nthis case, psilocybin\nare activating these brain\nnetworks that each of us\nhas more broadly than they\nwould normally be activated.\nThese are very abnormal patterns\nof thinking, and perceiving,\nand experiencing our emotional\nand physical life, et cetera.\nAnd yet so often, the\noutcomes are positive.\nNot always, but the\noutcomes are positive.\nThe experience is\npositive, even though it\nmight have these anxiety moments\nor components within them.\nIt's very important to\nunderstand that psilocybin\nand the journey while important\nare not really what all of this\nis about.\nIt's really about\nneuroplasticity.\nSo researchers, in\nparticular, neuroscientists\nare very intensely\ninterested in understanding\nwhat sorts of neuroplasticity\npsilocybin creates.\nBecause it turns\nout there are lots\nof different types or processes\ninvolved with neuroplasticity.\nFor instance, brain networks,\nbehavior, thinking, emotion, et\ncetera can change because of\nthe addition of new neurons.\nThat's one form\nof neuroplasticity\nthat's referred to as\nneurogenesis, the production\nof new neurons, most typically\nin the so-called dentate gyrus\nor other subregions\nof the hippocampus,\na brain area involved\nin learning and memory.\nNeurogenesis in other regions\nof the adult human brain\nare exceedingly rare.\nAnd to be honest,\nmay not occur at all.\nThis is a debated area.\nWe could do an entire\nepisode about this.\nBut for the most\npart, neuroscientists\ndon't really believe that\nyour neocortex, your striatum,\nyour cerebellum has that\nmuch neurogenesis that's\nrelated to learning and\nmemory of new things,\nor new experiences.\nAnd we don't actually think\nthat occurs as a consequence\nof taking psilocybin either.\nNow, some of you who\nare familiar with,\nfor instance, the cerebellum.\nYou might be saying, wait,\nwhat about granular cell\nproliferation in the cerebellum?\nOr what about the\nrostral migratory stream\nfrom the subventricular zone\nwhere there are neuroblasts\nspitting out little\nnew neurons that\nmigrate in through the nose to\nreplenish the olfactory neuron\npopulation?\nYes, that's all true.\nThat does occur.\nIt's been observed in mice,\nit's been observed in monkeys.\nAnd to some extent, it's\nbeen observed in humans.\nBut, again, I repeat it is not\na prominent feature of learning\nand acquisition of\nnew skills, new ideas,\nor new emotional states.\nPerhaps the best\nsupported evidence\nfor neurogenesis underlying\nnew thoughts, experiences,\nabilities, emotions, et\ncetera is the production\nof new neurons in\nthat dentate gyrus\nsubregion of the hippocampus.\nAnd that probably\ndoes occur in humans.\nBut neurogenesis is not\nreally the dominant mode\nof changing neural\ncircuitry in adult humans.\nIt might be a player\nin adolescence,\nin young childhood.\nIt is certainly a player\nbefore we are born\nwhen we are still in utero.\nBut then the brain\nis being wired up\nin many different\nways, including\nthe addition of new neurons\nand changing of connections.\nAll of this is to say that\nwhile neurogenesis is a really\nsticky idea and it\nmakes great headlines,\nthe addition of new neurons\nis not really the way\nthat the brain changes under\npsilocybin, other psychedelics,\nor just generally.\nIt's perhaps responsible\nfor maybe 1% to 2%,\nand I'm being generous\nthere, of the rewiring events\nthat are going to be most\nimportant for all of us.\nSo we need to set that\ndown and cement that there.\nUntil further evidence\ncomes out to the contrary,\nthat's certainly\nwhere I and here\nI feel comfortable speaking for\nthe majority of neuroscientists\nout there, professional\nneuroscientists.\nThat is the paper showing adult\nneurogenesis are interesting,\nbut they don't\nreally explain most\nof the plasticity that occurs\nin the adult human brain.\nSo if neurogenesis\nain't it, what is?\nWell, it's very clear that\npsilocybin, other psychedelics\nand any behavioral or\ndrug intervention that\ncan induce neuroplasticity does\nso largely through the addition\nor strengthening of\nnew neural connections\nor through the\nelimination or weakening\nof other neural connections.\nAnd if you look at the data\nexploring the mechanistic basis\nfor psilocybin induced\nneuroplasticity,\nit's mostly focused on animal\nbrains, animal models, mice\nand rats, in particular.\nA little bit on primates,\nbut mostly mice and rats\nbecause that's where\nthe interventions can\nbe done of knock out animals, of\nimaging the brain in real-time.\nOf course, there are\nthe beautiful studies\nof Robin Carhart-Harris\nand others exploring\nneuroplasticity at the\nlevel of brain imaging,\nat the level of\nultrasound measurements,\nof how active are certain brain\nareas in humans, how extensive\nis the modularity\nor not extensive\nis the modularity,\net cetera, the stuff\nwe talked about earlier.\nSo in other words, there\nare neuroplasticity studies,\nthe effects of\npsilocybin in humans.\nBut in terms of underlying\nmechanisms of neuroplasticity,\nI think the predominant theory\nis that psilocybin induces\nneuroplasticity through the\naddition of novel connections\nin those pyramidal neurons\nof the frontal cortex,\nelsewhere in the\ncortex, and certainly\nalso in the visual cortex.\nProbably also subcortical as\nwell below the cerebral cortex\nin areas like the thalamus,\nmaybe even in the brain\nstem as well.\nAnd that those\nneuroplasticity events\nare structural and functional.\nAnd they involve a\ncouple of basic events.\nThe most prominent of which\nis the growth of dendrites.\nDendrites are those little\nbranches or processes\nthat come out of the neurons,\nnot just the pyramidal neurons,\nbut other neurons as well.\nBut since we're talking mainly\nabout pyramidal neurons today.\nBoth the apical,\nthose ones that top.\nThey're called the apical tufts.\nThey're the ones that\nreach laterally to connect\nwith other neurons,\ncommunicate with other neurons\nthat we talked about before.\nAs well as the\ndendrites that come out\nof the base of those\npyramidal neurons.\nThose processes grow in\nresponse to psilocybin,\nas well as the addition of what\nare called dendritic spines.\nSo the dendrites\nare the branches.\nThe spines are these little\nprotrusions that grow out.\nActually, here, I don't know\nif this is coincidence or not.\nAgain, I always say I wasn't\nconsulted at the design phase.\nBut these little\nprotrusions actually\nlook like little mushrooms.\nThey have a little stalk\nand they have a little head,\na little spine, head.\nAnd those little\nspines-- so think\nof these as like little\ntiny mushroom appearing.\nOK.\nThey aren't actual mushrooms.\nOK.\nThe first person that puts in\nthe comments, oh, my goodness.\nI learned today that mushrooms\ngrow out of our neurons.\nWhen we take magic mushrooms,\nthat is not what I'm saying.\nWhat I'm saying is that\nthese little mushroom shaped\nprotrusions that we're\ncalling dendritic spines\ndo in fact grow out of\ndendritic branches of neurons\nwhen animals ingest\npsilocybin or are\ninjected with psilocybin.\nAnd that those little\nmushroom shaped protrusions\nare the sites of new excitatory\nconnections, new locations\nfor input from other\nneurons to activate\nthose neurons that have\nthose little mushroom-shaped\nprotrusions.\nIf you'd like to see examples\nof this, both movies and still\nshots, it's pretty remarkable.\nThere's a paper that I'll\nprovide a link to in the show\nnote captions.\nThis was published in the\nJournal Neuron, Cell Press\nJournal, Excellent Journal,\nentitled Psilocybin Induces\nRapid and Persistent\nGrowth of Dendritic Spines\nin the frontal Cortex In Vivo.\nSo these measurements were\ndone in the mouse equivalent\nmore or less of the\nprefrontal cortex.\nThere are some interesting\ndetails in this paper,\nfor instance, that those\nnew connections persist.\nSo they don't just grow out\nduring the psilocybin being\nactive in the bloodstream\nand brain of the animal,\nthey persist.\nOK.\nSo this may again.\nMay explain some of\nthe persistent changes\nthat occur in people\nafter psilocybin journeys.\nThey may too grow new spines.\nI should also mention\nthat a reduction\nin the number of dendritic\nspines, these little mushroom\nshaped protrusions\nin the frontal cortex\nneurons of humans occurs\nin depressed patients.\nWe know that from\npostmortem tissue.\nAnd that drugs that\nrelieve depression\nor that treatments including\nbehavioral treatments, that\nprovide some relief\nfrom depression do\nseem to be correlated\nwith increases\nin spine growth in frontal\ncortex neurons as well.\nSo this raises a very\ninteresting idea,\nwhich is perhaps it's the\ngrowth of new connections,\nthese new dendritic spines\nin particular neurons.\nThat's created by\nadministration of psilocybin.\nThat explains the\nrelief from depression\nthat people experience.\nSo this is just one paper.\nBut it's one paper of a growing\nbody of work showing that, yes,\nindeed, psilocybin induces\nboth structural and functional\nplasticity in the\nhuman and animal brain.\nIt does that in the human\nbrain at therapeutic doses\nof anywhere from 10\nto 25, perhaps even\n30 milligrams per session,\none or two sessions.\nI should mention that the\nmouse studies tended to use\nquite high doses of psilocybin.\nI wasn't shocked, but I was\nsomewhat wide eyed for a moment\nto realize that most of the\nstudies looking at changes\nin plasticity in the mouse\nbrain in response to psilocybin\nuse the equivalent of 1\nmilligrams per kilogram\nof body weight, which\nis if you do the math,\nand you translate what we were\ntalking about before in terms\nof dosages, I'll just\nspare you all the time,\nit's about double, the sorts\nof dosages that are typically\nused in humans.\nMaybe even triple in some cases.\nNow, it's often the\ncase in animal studies\nbecause of the\nmetabolism of animals\nbeing different, but also\nbecause seeing effects of drugs\nin animal studies\ncan be difficult.\nThey did use a dose response\nanywhere from 0 to 0.25\nto 0.5 to 1 to 2\nmilligrams per kilogram\nof psilocybin in the study.\nSo they had a dose\nresponse curve.\nBut focused mainly on this 1\nmilligrams per kilogram dosage.\nIn any event, the\npoint is that many\nof the studies that\ndescribe these pretty\ndramatic structural changes\nin the animal brain,\nmost typically the\nmouse brain in response\nto psilocybin use\ndosages of psilocybin\nthat if translated\nto humans would\nbe about double the\nhuman therapeutic dose.\nSo that is something\nthat we need\nto take into consideration.\nNonetheless, it's very clear\nthat in both animal studies\nand humans,\npsilocybin is inducing\nboth structural and functional\nchanges in brain circuitry.\nAnd that in humans, the\nnetwork connectivity\nis being changed dramatically.\nWe talked about\nthose data earlier.\nAnd that the underlying\nbasis for that might be,\nagain, might be.\nWe don't know for sure.\nThe addition of new dendritic\nspines on these pyramidal\nneurons that we've been\ntalking about repeatedly\nthroughout today's episode.\nAlthough neurogenesis\nperhaps and other modes\nof neuroplasticity,\nsuch as the elimination\nof certain connections.\nPerhaps related to unhealthy\nmaladaptive thoughts,\nor feeling that a particular\nsad song is overwhelmingly sad.\nIt could be the case that\nthose sorts of things\nchange subjectively\nbecause of the removal\nof neural connections.\nIf you're going to think like\na neurobiologist or scientist\nfor that matter,\nyou don't ever want\nto think that one\nmechanism can explain\nall the effects of a given\ndrug or a given experience.\nIt's almost certainly\nlikely to be\nthe consequence of multiple\nmechanisms acting in parallel.\nAnd because I know there\nare people out there who\nwould like to even more about\nthe neuroplasticity induced\nby psychedelics,\nincluding psilocybin,\nthere's a wonderful review\nthat I provide a link to\nin the show note captions\nentitled, Psychedelics\nand Neuroplasticity: A\nSystematic Review Unraveling\nthe Biological Underpinnings\nof Psychedelics.\nThis review is great\nbecause it goes a step\nbeyond just psilocybin\nand psilocin\nbinding to the serotonin to a\nreceptor, and things like brain\nderived neurotrophic factor.\nIt actually talks a lot about\nthe intracellular signaling\nand exactly how neurons change\ntheir excitability patterns\nbased on this activation of\nthe serotonin 2A receptor.\nIt's probably more\ndetail than most of you\nout there are interested in.\nBut if you are interested\nin that level of detail,\nthis is a wonderful\nopen access review.\nSo a few minutes ago,\nI talked about where\nthere is strong, modest,\nand somewhat weak\nor rather, I should\nsay, minimal evidence\nfor the therapeutic\nuse of psilocybin\nto treat various disorders.\nAnd across the board,\nit really appears\nthat major depression\nand so-called intractable\ndepression, in some\ncases, is where\nwe're seeing the most\nexciting research to date.\nNow keep in mind that because\nof the Controlled Substances\nAct being invoked in 1970\nin the United States,\nand because it was only\njust a few years ago really,\nonly about five years ago,\nthat psychedelics including\npsilocybin received what's\ncalled a breakthrough\nstatus at the FDA.\nThat there are now a\nlot of clinical trials\nexploring how\npsilocybin can impact\nvarious things like mood\ndisorders, addictive disorders,\nand so on.\nPrior to 2018, when that\ntherapeutic breakthrough\npotential was established\nin the United States,\nI think a lot of people in\nthe so-called psychedelics\ncommunity had the sense,\nand really the belief\nthat these drugs had\nenormous potential.\nBut they just weren't being\nexplored that extensively.\nSo I do want to give a nod\nto the incredible researchers\nsuch as Robin Carhart-Harris,\nbut also Matthew\nJohnson, Roland Griffiths,\nNolan Williams, and many others.\nOK.\nI'm certainly not\nlisting off everybody.\nThat would take hours.\nBut those researchers\nhave really pioneered\nboth the legal efforts,\nand the funding efforts,\nand most importantly,\nthe research\nefforts defining\nthe clinical data\nthat I'm about to describe.\nAnd here, I'm going to\nsummarize the clinical data\nin a bit of a top\ncontour fashion\njust giving you the\nkind of highlights.\nWe will, of course,\nprovide links to the papers\nif you'd like to\nlook into it further.\nBut I'm only giving\nyou the top contour\nbecause I've had the great\nfortune of having Matthew\nJohnson on this podcast before.\nYou can find that episode\nat hubermanlab.com.\nJust simply put Matt's name or\npsychedelics into the search\nfunction.\nIt'll take you to that\nepisode in all formats\nor links to all formats rather.\nI've also had the great fortune\nof sitting down recently\nwith Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris\nto talk about his work\nat University of California San\nFrancisco on psilocybin, LSD,\nAyahuasca, and DMT as\nit relates to depression\nand other disorders.\nAnd that episode,\nwhich also will\nbe released at hubermanlab.com\nand on all platforms YouTube,\nApple, Spotify.\nReally goes in depth into\nthese clinical studies\nand what those studies really\nlook like, who's in the room,\nwhether or not\npeople just get one\ndose or two doses, how far\napart those are separated.\nAll of that is covered\nin extensive detail\nin that what I found to be\nwonderful discussion with Dr.\nRobin Carhart-Harris.\nSo if you're interested\nin all of the details\nas it relates to clinical\napplication of psychedelics,\nstay tuned for\nthat episode soon.\nAgain, you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com\nand on all platforms.\nIn the meantime,\nI would be remiss\nif I didn't include\na bit of discussion\nabout what has been observed\nin terms of using psilocybin\njourneys as a way to treat\ndepression because the data are\njust oh, so exciting.\nAgain, these data really\nstarted to surface\nas the consequence\nof studies that\nwere initiated around 2006 in\njust a few select laboratories.\nAnd then really\npicked up in terms\nof the number of\nlaboratories and number\nof studies between 2018 and now.\nSo what you'll\nnotice is that most\nof the papers I'm about to\ndescribe were published in,\nfor instance,\nPhenomenal Journals,\nNew England Journal\nof Medicine in 2021,\nand New England Journal of\nMedicine November 2022, Journal\nof the American Medical\nAssociation Psychiatry\njust very recently, 2021.\nSo these are very recent papers.\nEssentially, all of\nthese clinical studies\ninvolve either one or\ntwo psilocybin sessions.\nThe dosages that were explored\nrange from 0 milligrams.\nSo placebo, if you will.\n10 milligrams, in some\ncases, 25 milligrams,\nin some cases, 30 milligrams.\nAnd most typically, people\nreceived the same dosage\nfor both sessions if indeed\nthey did both sessions.\nHowever, there's\nat least one study\nlooking at just\none single episode\nof psilocybin administration.\nSo this is the paper entitled.\nNo surprise single dose\npsilocybin for treatment\nresistant episode\nof major depression.\nThis was published in the New\nEngland Journal of Medicine\nin November of 2022.\nI'll just summarize the results\nof this single application\nstudy.\nThey randomly assigned\nsubjects who had\ntreatment resistant depression.\nSo they had resisted\ntreatment to other things.\nTo receive a single dose\nof a synthetic formulation\nof psilocybin.\nSo they're not eating\nmushrooms, they're\ngetting a synthetic\ndose of psilocybin.\nBut the dose is known of either\n25 milligrams, 10 milligrams,\nor 1 milligram, which\nwas the control.\nAnd they receive\npsychological support.\nThere were a number of different\ntests, subjective tests\nof depression taken before and\nafter the psilocybin journey.\nThey had about 75 to 79\nparticipants in each group.\nAgain, at the three different\ndoses 25, 10, or 1 milligrams.\nAnd they looked at the\nchanges in these scores,\nthese depression related\nscores on these tests.\nThere are many results from\nthis paper one could summarize.\nBut among the most\nimportant results\nI can summarize\nfrom the discussion\nand here I'm paraphrasing, that\nthe change in baseline levels\nof depression that is at week\nthree following the psilocybin\nsession was\nsignificantly better.\nThat is people experienced\nmore relief or more people\nexperienced more relief\nfrom the 25 milligram dose\nthan from the 1 milligram dose.\nAnd this is important.\nThere was no\nsignificant difference\nbetween the 10 milligram dose\nand the 1 milligram dose.\nThis really points to the\nfact that the 25 to 30\nmilligram dose that's used in\nthe largest numbers of studies\nexploring treatment resistant\ndepression really seems to be,\nI don't want to say the best\ndose, but the most effective\ndose at least in this\nclinical context,\nin this set and setting and\nwith this particular patient\npopulation.\nSo we want to be careful to say\nthat so that one doesn't just\ntranslate that 25 milligrams\nis better than 10 milligrams.\nAlthough in this study it\nwas for sake of treatment\nresistant depression relief.\nThere were a number of other\nkey aspects of this paper.\nIn particular, the exploration\nof so-called adverse events.\nSo things like\nheadaches, propensity\nfor self-harm, actual\nself-harm, anxiety, and so on.\nIt's worth mentioning that\nthere were adverse events\nin essentially every group.\nThe number of adverse\nevents was highest\nin the 25-milligram dose group.\nThis is observed in\nother studies as well.\nWith higher dosages,\nthere tends to be\ngreater relief from\ndepressive symptoms,\nbut also a greater chance\nfor adverse events.\nSome of those adverse\nevents can be quite severe.\nSo feelings of suicidal\nideation, et cetera.\nSome of them one could\nconsider a little less\nsevere, mild headache, or severe\nheadache that was transient,\nor anxiety that was transient.\nAgain, highly\nindividual responses.\nWe could go line\nby line and table\nby table through this paper,\nwhich we won't because there's\na lot of data.\nAgain, we'll provide\na link to this paper\nif you'd like to\nperuse it yourself.\nIt's fairly\nstraightforward to read.\nThat's one thing that's nice\nabout these clinical trials is\nthey tend to be written in\nfairly non-technical language.\nAlthough there's a little\nbit of technical language.\nThe important point\nis that a single dose\nof 25 milligrams of psilocybin\nprovided significant relief\nfrom treatment\nresistant depression\nin this particular\npatient population.\nBut it is not the case\nthat 100% of the people who\ntook 25 milligrams of psilocybin\nexperienced that relief.\nHowever, the\nmajority of them did.\nNow, when you say\nmajority in science,\nyou really need to\nlook to numbers.\nAnd the reason I'm not telling\nyou, oh, it was 75% or 60%\nor 50% is because it\ndepends on which time\npoint people were analyzed.\nPeople were asked about their\nlevel of depression relief\nimmediately after\none week after,\ntwo weeks after, or\nthree weeks after.\nAnd the degree of relief\ntended to change over time.\nIn fact, it tended to\ndiminish over time.\nBut it was also stable\nor remarkably stable,\nI should say, at\nleast by my read\nin the 25-milligram dose group.\nAnd that is summarized nicely\nin figure 2 of the paper.\nBecause they explored these\npeople's levels of depression\nout to week 12.\nAnd they still saw\na significant degree\nof depression relief 12 weeks\nafter the single 25-milligram\npsilocybin dose session.\nSo as I mentioned earlier,\nthere are now about a dozen\nor so excellent\nstudies, clinical trials\nexploring the use of single\nor two session psilocybin\ntreatment in that 25 to\n30-milligram range, which\nseems to be the most effective\ndose for long-lasting relief\nfrom depression.\nEach one of those studies\nexplored something different\nas is important.\nReplication is also\nimportant, of course,\nin order to validate\nprevious studies.\nBut, for instance,\nthere have been\ncomparisons of psilocybin versus\nSSRIs or other antidepressants.\nThere have been comparisons of\npsilocybin plus psychoanalysis\nor cognitive behavioral\ntherapy, versus\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nalone, or psychoanalysis alone.\nAnd so there's a\nlot of evaluation\nnow of the clinical outcomes.\nAnd the statistical outcomes\nof these subjective measures\nand even some objective measures\nof neurochemistry where that's\npossible in terms of\ntrying to understand\nif and how psilocybin is\neffective for the treatment\nof depression.\nAnd the major takeaway\nis that, indeed, it\ndoes seem to be the case.\nAnd the numbers that I feel\ncomfortable not throwing out\nthere, but putting out to\nyou reflect my conversation\nwith Robin Carhart-Harris.\nAgain, that will\nbe released soon\nat hubermanlab.com,\nas well as takeaways\nfrom what I would say are the\nsix broadest studies, meaning\nthey have the widest range\nof age groups, the broadest\ndemographic in terms of the\nsubjects, their backgrounds,\ntheir levels of education, men,\nwomen, ethnicity, et cetera.\nAnd a lot of that\ncan be summarized\nin the paper entitled, Effects\nof Psilocybin Assisted Therapy\non Major Depressive Disorder.\nThis was a particular\nrandomized clinical trial.\nBut in the discussion, I\nthink they summarize it\nquite well, which is that if\nyou look at the number of people\nwho take this 25-milligram dose\ntwice in sessions spaced about\na week apart, what you will\nfind is that anywhere from 60%\nto 75% of the people who have\nmajor depressive disorder who\ndo these psilocybin sessions\nin the proper setting,\nreport a good\nexperience with it,\nhave minimal adverse events\ncoming out of those sessions\nand in the weeks following,\nthose people experience\nsubstantial positive relief\nfrom major depression.\nIn ways that other treatments\nthat they had explored,\nincluding antidepressant drugs,\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nand other types of therapy\nalone could not provide.\nNow, it's a general feature of\nthese clinical trials focusing\non psilocybin that\npeople are asked\nto stop taking their\nantidepressants\nprior to participating\nin the trial.\nIt's also a general\nfeature of these trials\nthat people are encouraged\nto not suddenly start\ntheir antidepressant treatment\nimmediately afterwards because,\nof course, that could confound\nthe results of the psilocybin\ntreatment.\nHowever, and this is a very\nimportant thing to note\nall subjects were\nencouraged not to avoid\ntaking those\nantidepressant medications\nif, in fact, their\nclinician felt\nthat it was important for\ntheir immediate and long-term\nsurvival.\nSo no one should be\nreckless in thinking\nabout what to add or delete\nfrom their drug protocol\nwhen dealing with depression.\nAll right.\nThe outcomes could be\nvery severe in that case.\nNonetheless, we can\nparaphrase from the discussion\nof the paper I just mentioned.\nBecause it really highlights\nthe incredible results\nthat psilocybin applied in these\nparticular therapeutic settings\nare providing.\nAnd here, again,\nI'm paraphrasing.\nThe present trial\nshowed that psilocybin\nadministered in the\ncontext of supportive\npsychotherapy consisting\nof approximately 11 hours\nof psychotherapy.\nSo this is going\nto be two sessions\nof the psilocybin with\nproper therapeutic support.\nProduced large rapid and\nsustained antidepressant\neffects.\nThe effect size is\nreported in this study\nwere approximately 2.5 times\ngreater than the effects\nsizes found in psychotherapy.\nAnd more than four times\ngreater than the effect sizes\nfound in psychopharmacologic\ndepression treatment studies.\nIn other words, four\ntimes the positive effect\nobserved with typical\nSSRIs or other pharmacology\nof that sort.\nThese findings are consistent\nwith the literature that\nshowed that combined\npharmacotherapy\nand psychotherapy were more\nefficacious in the treatment\nof major depressive disorder\nthan either intervention alone.\nSo, again, this\npoints to the fact\nthat combining drug\ntherapy with talk therapy\nas it's often called\nis going to be\nmore effective than\neither treatment alone.\nHere are the drug therapy\nis psilocybin therapy.\nAnd, again, please don't take\nthe fact that in these studies,\nthey tended to ask people to\nnot take their antidepressant\nmedication heading into\nthe study as a sign\nthat one should stop\ntaking their antidepressant\nmedication.\nRather I think this study and\nother studies like it, again,\nwhich we'll provide\nlinks to in the show\nnote captions that are discussed\nextensively in the episode\nwith Dr. Carhart-Harris\nsoon to come,\nreally point to\nthe incredible role\nthat psilocybin can have\nin creating an experience\ninside of the\nsession the journey\nor the trip as it's called,\nas well as initiating\nneuroplastic events, perhaps the\naddition of dendritic spines.\nMaybe even some\nnew neurons maybe.\nAlthough I don't think\nthat's the predominant mode.\nBut that leads to these more\nextensive connectivities\nin the brain, the so-called\nreduction in modular networks\nenhanced activity in brain\nareas that normally wouldn't\nbe talking to one another.\nBut not doing that in any\nkind of haphazard way.\nIt really does seem that the one\nor two sessions of psilocybin\nthat induce these feelings\nof ego dissolution, that\ninduce these feelings of\noceanic boundlessness, right?\nSo mystical.\nAnd in many ways, it's\nwhat I find so incredible\nabout psilocybin and\nother psychedelics is that\ndespite the highly mystical,\nhighly subjective, and still\nat this time somewhat top\ncontour understanding of how\nthey might exert their effects.\nYou can highlight boldface\nand underline might there\nbecause it hasn't really\nbeen firmly established\nwhat the exact cell biological\nrewiring events are.\nBut there is now\nwhat I would refer\nto as a center of mass of\ndata that point to the fact\nthat psilocybin when taken\nin the appropriate set\nand setting, at the\nappropriate dosages\ncan invoke the sorts of\nneuroplasticity and changes\nin emotionality, in\nperceptual experience,\nnot just during the\npsychedelic session,\nbut for long periods of time\nafter the psychedelic session.\nThat can provide really\nremarkable relief\nfrom things like\nmajor depression\nand perhaps other\npsychiatric issues as well.\nAnd, of course, I\nrealize that many of you\nare listening to and/or\nwatching this episode.\nAnd you're not\nnecessarily depressed\nor thinking about\npsychedelics like psilocybin\nin the context of depression.\nI hope today's\ndiscussion allowed\nyou to better understand how\npsychedelics and psilocybin,\nin particular, because that's\nwhat we've been talking about,\nare able to exert these\nincredible effects that they\nseem to exert.\nThis is not a call for everyone\nto run out and do psilocybin.\nIt is absolutely not that.\nIt is, however, my attempt\nto really put a magnifying\nlens on this incredible\narea of research\nthat's happening not just in\nthe context of clinical trials,\nbut in the context of trying\nto understand how serotonin\nand how drugs like\npsilocybin, which in many ways\nmimic serotonin, and\nmore particularly,\nthe activation of particular\nreceptors in the brain\nlike the serotonin\nto a receptor.\nI mean, just sit back\nand think about that\nthe selective activation of this\nreceptor, which is, by the way,\nassociated with the expansion of\nthe neocortex across evolution.\nDidn't mention that\nbefore, but indeed it is.\nHow that can lead to\nenhanced ways of thinking,\nchanged ways of\nthinking, actual learning\ninside of this short\n4-hour or 6-hour session\nthat we call the\nPsilocybin Journey.\nSo as is often the case,\nperhaps as is always\nthe case here on the\nHuberman Lab podcast,\nwe did a deep dive\ninto a topic today\ninto the topic of psilocybin.\nWhat it is, how it\nworks, the different ways\nin which it changes\nbrain circuitry,\nhow it creates the\nexperiences that we think\nof as the psilocybin journey,\nwhat the safety issues are,\nwhat the so-called set\nand setting are that\ncan lend themselves to\npositive therapeutic outcomes.\nAnd in doing so,\nmy goal was really\nto highlight several things.\nFirst of all, I am very\nexcited about the potential\nfor psychedelics such as\npsilocybin to provide relief\nfor mental health issues\nthat to date have been\nvery hard for people to access.\nIn addition to that,\nI'm just fundamentally\ninterested in the brain and how\nit works and how it can change.\nThis thing we call\nneuroplasticity.\nTo me, neuroplasticity\nis the Holy Grail\nof the human nervous system.\nAs far as we know,\nwe are the animal\nthat can have long-lasting\nneuroplasticity\nthroughout the lifespan.\nAnd if it requires\nthe use of compounds\nin a safe and controlled\nway, such as psilocybin\nin order to achieve maximal\nplasticity in a short amount\nof time, that's exciting.\nBut, of course, that also\nneeds to be considered\nwith all of the safety\nprecautions in mind\nthat we talked about earlier,\nincluding the fact that people\nwho have a predisposition or\nwho have psychosis, or bipolar\ndisorder, or a relative that has\npsychosis, or bipolar disorder.\nYounger people, meaning people\n25 years of age and younger.\nAnd really anyone\nwho's not working\nwith a dedicated and\nhighly trained physician\nneeds to be very cautious\nabout these compounds as well.\nThey're very exciting.\nI think psilocybin is\nan exciting and super\ninteresting compound for\nbasic and clinical reasons\nand for other reasons as well.\nBut they are sharp\nblades as we say.\nAnd with sharp blades, you\ncan do incredible things,\nbut you can also cut\nyourself very badly.\nSo all those considerations\nneed to be taken to mind.\nSo I consider the science\nand use of psilocybin\nto be an exciting, but\nstill preliminary area\nthat I certainly am paying\na lot of attention to.\nAnd I know there's a\nlot of excitement about.\nSo stay tuned for the episode\nwith Dr. Robin Carhart-Harris.\nAnd we will probably\nrevisit psilocybin\nand we will certainly revisit\nthe other psychedelics\nand non-classical psychedelics\nincluding LSD, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT,\nketamine, MDMA, mescaline,\nand all the rest\nin future episodes as well.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe
