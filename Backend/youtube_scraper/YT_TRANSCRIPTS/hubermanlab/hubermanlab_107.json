    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine\ntoday my guest is Dr Noam Sobel Dr Noam\nSobel is a professor of neurobiology in\nthe department of brain Sciences at the\nWiseman Institute of science his\nlaboratory studies olfaction and\nchemosensation olfaction is of course\nour sense of smell chemo sensation is\nour ability to respond to chemicals in\nour environment today we're going to\nlearn some absolutely incredible facts\nabout how you interact with the world\nand other people around you for instance\nyou will learn that humans can smell\nthings around them as well as dogs can\nin fact humans are incredibly good at\nsensing the chemical world around them\nyou also learn for instance that every\ntime you meet somebody you are taking\nchemicals from that person either from\nthe chemical Cloud that surrounds them\nor directly from the surface of their\nbody and you are actually applying it to\nyour own body and you are processing\ninformation about that person's\nchemicals to determine many things about\nthem including how stressed they are\ntheir hormone levels things that operate\nat a subconscious love level on your\nbrain and nervous system and the impact\nyour emotions your decision making and\nwho you choose to relate to or not to\nrelate to you will also learn that tears\nyes the tears of others are impacting\nyour hormone levels in powerful ways\nyou will also learn that every so often\nactually on a regular schedule there is\nan alternation of ease through which you\ncan breathe through one nostril or the\nother and that alternation reflects an\nunderlying Dynamic of your nervous\nsystem and has a lot to do with how\nalert or sleepy you happen to be\nthe list of things that Dr Nome sobel's\nlaboratory has discovered that relate to\neveryday life and that are going to make\nyou say wow I can't believe that happens\nbut then go out into the real world and\nactually observe that that happens in\nways that are incredibly interesting\njust goes on and on in fact his\nlaboratory discovered that we are always\nsensing our own odors that's right even\nthough you might not notice your own\nsmell you are always sensing your own\nodor cloud and throughout the day you\nperiodically smell yourself deliberately\neven though you might not realize it in\norder to change your cognition and\nbehavior I first learned of Dr sobel's\nlaboratory through a rather odd\nobservance that observance took place\nwhen I was a graduate student many years\nago at UC Berkeley at the time Nom Sobo\nwas a professor at UC Berkeley as I\nmentioned before he has since moved to\nthe Weissman well I was walking through\nthe Berkeley campus and I saw people on\ntheir hands and knees but with their\nhead very close to the ground and their\neyes were covered their hands were\ncovered their mouths were covered and\nonly their nose was exposed and what I\nwas observing was an experiment being\nconducted by the Sobel laboratory in\nwhich humans were following a scent\ntrail that Central was actually buried\nsome depth underneath the Earth and yet\nthey could follow that Central with a\nhigh degree of fidelity it was from that\nexperiment and other experiments done in\nDr sobel's laboratory at Berkeley and at\nthe Wiseman involving neuroimaging and a\nnumber of other tools and techniques\nthat revealed the incredible power of\nhuman old faction and humans ability to\nfollow scent Trails if they need to and\nthat of course led to many other\nimportant discoveries some of which I\nalluded to a few moments ago but you are\ngoing to learn about many many other\nimportant discoveries in the realm of\nolfaction in chemosensation that have\nbeen carried out by Dr Silver's\nlaboratory through the course of today's\nepisode and by the end of today's\nepisode I assure you that you will never\nlook at or smell the world around you\nthe same way again before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Roca Rococo\nmakes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are\nof the absolute highest quality I've\nspent a lifetime working on the biology\nthe visual system and I can tell you\nthat your visual system has to contend\nwith an enormous number of challenges in\norder for you to be able to see clearly\nRoca eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ndesigned with the biology of the visual\nsystem in mind so no matter whether or\nnot you're wearing them for sport\nwhether or not you're wearing them for\nwork or for socializing you can always\nsee with Crystal Clarity their glasses\nare extremely lightweight so most of the\ntime you don't even realize that you're\nwearing them I wear Roca readers at\nnight and sometimes when I drive at\nnight and I wear Roca sunglasses\nthroughout the day except of course I do\nnot wear them for my morning sunlight\nviewing if you'd like to try Roca\neyeglasses or sunglasses go to

thesis\nmakes custom nootropics and nootropics\nis a word that I do not like because it\nmeans smart drugs as a neurobiologist I\ncan tell you that there is no neural\ncircuit in your brain for being smart\nthere are neural circuits for Focus\nthere are neural circuits for memory\nthere are neural circuits for creativity\nand there are neural circuits for task\nswitching thesis understands that\nthere's a diversity of neural circuits\nthat support different brain body States\nand therefore design nootropics that are\ncustomized to achieve specific brain\nbody States if you go to the

my\ndiscussion with Dr Noam Sobel Dr Sobel\ngnome welcome thank you must say I am\nextremely excited for this come\nconversation I've been a huge fan of\nyour work for more than a decade or two\nuh yes kind of frightening yeah but yeah\nwe overlapped at UC Berkeley some time\nago although we did not meet and we\nlived in the same apartment and we just\nlearned that the amazing apartment\nthat you moved out of was the apartment\nthat my girlfriend and I at the time\nmoved into in 2006 I believe so uh\nwe've shared quite a few things\num and today I would love for you to\nshare with us\num All About The Amazing landscape of\nchemo sensation in particular olfaction\nor sense of smell and some related\nperceptual abilities or subconscious\nabilities including pheromones Etc\nto get everybody on the same page I'd\nlike to just start off by asking\nwhat are the major components of our\nability to smell\nobviously or I like to think it involves\nthe nose at some level it does to what\nextent is that mixed in with other\nsenses like taste and\nperhaps more importantly\nwhat about the chemicals that we are\nsensing through this thing and for those\nof you listening um and not watching I'm\ntapping my nose that we are not aware of\nyou know that the chemicals that are\nthat we're inhaling and\num making sense of without our awareness\nif you could just um give us the top\nContour or even deep Contour if you like\nof the uh the parts list and the various\nroles they play so you you've asked a\nlot of questions at once\num you know I'll start with a little\ncomment on the way you you said smelling\nthrough our nose which we indeed do but\nwe also smell through our mouth actually\nthere's a process referred to as\nretronasal olfaction where\num odorants come up through our the back\nof our throat and\nout of our nose the reverse way and we\nsmell things that way as well and in\nfact a big part of the contribution of\nolfaction to food and taste comes from\nthat from retro nasal off action but uh\nuh primary olfaction is referred to as\northonasal faction that is through our\nnews we Sniff and sniffing is a big\nthing well I have a sense we might talk\nabout that a lot today in all sorts of\ncontexts so we sniff in through our nose\nand to answer your general question of\nthe organization of the system\num so molecules Airborne molecules\ntravel up our nose a distance in the\nhuman of about six or seven centimeters\nto about here where they interact with I\nwill use the word sheet of receptors but\nshe is a bit misleading here it's not a\nsheet it's very convoluted\nwe have about seven million such\nreceptors uh lining a structure known as\nthe olfactory epithelium this is the\nsensory surface of the olfactory system\nthe olfactory epithelium again about\nprobably about six or seven million\nreceptors in the human in the human\nprobably of about\n350 different kinds so that's amazing\nthat means a meaningful percentage of\nyour genome is devoted just to this just\nto the kinds of olfactory receptor\nsubtypes you have in your nose by the\nway I can share an amusing story I would\nimagine amusing stories are good for\npodcasts\nso that number of six or seven million\nreceptors\nis probably not very well grounded it's\nhard to count but it's reasonably\ngrounded and there was this thing\nroaming around in the literature about\nBloodhounds having billion receptors in\ntheir nose which is why they're so\namazing and this number was you know it\nsort of propagated through the\nliterature and and our lab has written\nover the years a few review chapters and\nand we were repeatedly writing the\nolfaction chapter for a very large one\nof these large textbooks the gazanaga\nhandbook of cognitive Neuroscience I\nthink it's called\num\nand and we had that in there as well\nsomewhere and and one time when we're\nrenewing the chapter for a new version\nof the book I told the graduate student\nwho was leading that at the time she's\nnow a professor at Tel Aviv University I\ntold her check that check that reference\nout where in the world did that come\nfrom and we started going back and back\nand back and it turns out it comes from\na textbook\nan Australian textbook\nand we found the author of The Textbook\nand and we wrote her and I said look\nthere's this thing in in the literature\nof a billion receptors in in the\nBloodhound where did that come from\nand and surprisingly she answered me and\nyou know I was hoping to get a reference\nright but it was a reference and and\nthis is where it really becomes funny\nfor us because she said I I was once um\nat a lecture of uh an all-faction\ngeneticists geneticist by the name of\nDuron Lancet and he said that in the\nlecture now this is really funny because\nshe's in Australia this is all over the\nworld this number and I'm writing her\nfrom Israel and Doran lancid is in the\nbuilding next to me okay he's in\nWeitzman Institute genetics I mean he\nused to be he's retired now uh and and\nhe he had meaningful contributions in\nthe history of wolf action\num so I picked up the internal phone and\nand I said hey Duron you know did you\nsay that there's a billion receptors in\nthe Bloodhound knows and he said what's\na bloodhound\nso this is totally made up right it\ntotally made up and it propagated I mean\nyou can you can probably go into Google\nand type like a billion receptors in the\nblood town and you'll get a lot of hits\nbut there was absolutely no evidence for\nthat amazing and not just amazing in\nlight of what it it tells us about\nolfaction and Bloodhounds or otherwise\nbut amazing because it sheds light on\njust how much of what is in textbooks\nscientific and medical is absolutely\nwrong things things propagate and and\nyou know you set yourself in right so we\nfixed that in that version of right and\nand so to finish the line so that so\nodorants interact with these receptors\num here in our epithelium where they\nundergo what is referred to as\ntransduction that is the odorance our\nDock of the receptor and turn into a\nneural signal or\nenforce the receptor to respond in a\nneural signal and this neural signal in\nfact action potential is not gradient\npotentials of any kind uh propagates uh\nvia the olfactory nerve now this is a\nnerve that goes from our epithelium\nright here behind the forehead no it's\nwell yeah yeah here uh through uh the\nthinnest part of our skull an area\nreferred to as the cribriform plate\nwhich is perforated it has a lot of\nholes the nerve goes through those holes\nand synapses at the first Target in the\nbrain uh which is the olfactory bulb\nand humans\nthat forms an interesting\nuh point of sensitivity\num because a lot of people lose their\nsense of smell due to trauma uh because\nof that structure yeah a head hit type\ntrauma well yes although uh you denoted\nhitting on the front of the head which\nis where all this real estate is but\nactually uh the more common cause for\nlosing your sense of smell for trauma is\nthe back of the head because of what's\nreferred to as a contra coup injury so\nas your listener is probably no our\nbrain is floating in liquid in CSF and\ncerebrospinal fluid inside our skull and\nwhen we get hit in the back of the head\nthe brain has this forward and backward\nmovement in the liquid in in the skull\nit sort of crashes it can crash against\nthe front of the skull which is why you\nalso have in a contract Winery you also\noften have frontal damage but what\nhappens is that this generates a\nshearing motion on the crib form plate\nand the olfactory nerve is severed and\nif it's completely severed it's it's\nlost forever because my understanding is\nthat the olfactory Sensory neurons can\nare among the few central nervous system\nneurons in adult humans that can\nregenerate so or replenish themselves\nright so so I'll I'll again there are a\nfew questions yeah that's okay so first\nof all we will spin many plates\nsimultaneously if it's completely\nsevered completely then yes you're lost\nforever yeah if it's completely savored\nbecause even if you'll have regeneration\nat the basal cell level at epithelium\nthey won't manage to find their way back\nuh to the bulb if if you have partial or\nsomething left or something shows up in\na short while after the injury then you\nhave a good chance of recovery because\nthey grow along the trajectory of the\nother axons or pioneering the way for\nthem assumingly yeah interesting and so\nso basically and and basically the time\nframe and you know it's funny I get a\nlot of emails on this although I'm not a\nmedical doctor but but I get a lot of\nemails from people who have lost their\nsense of smell because it's very\ndistressing and now more people know\nthis because of kovid that it's very\ndistressing\nand and basically the rule of thumb is\nthat if you don't get it back within a\nyear to a year and a half you'll never\nuh get it back my understanding of the\nstatistics on olfactory loss in covid\nand and other viral type infections is\nthat\num first of all I had I experienced that\nwhen I got covered including total and\nawesome for one day and not total it was\njust there was a remnant of an ability\nto to smell or set or perceive the smell\nof a lemon and I was huffing as hard as\nI possibly could I actually uh there's\nan over-the-counter remedy and this is\nnot uh pseudoscience because there's a\nnumber of papers published about this on\nPubMed the alpha lipoic acid can\naccelerate the recovery of of smell yeah\nand and so that's something that it\nworked successfully for me I'm not\nsaying that that's the only or I don't\nknow if it works successfully for you or\nif you would have recovered anyway I\nmean you didn't do a control that I was\nnot willing to do the control experiment\nuh exactly yeah let me say two things on\nthis front first the date on the alpha\nlipoic acid is\n[Music]\none word about the smelling the lemon\nand this is uh I'll take that\nopportunity to to share more information\nwhen we smell things\nit's the result of more sensory\nsubsystems than the olfactory system\nalone\nso you have several chemosensory\nsensitive nerves in your nose\na primary one beyond the olfactory nerve\nis the trigeminal nerve the fifth\ncranial nerve so the trigeminal nerve\nhas sensory endings in your nose and\nyour throat and in your eye it has three\nbranches that's why an onion has smell\nand burns your eyes and burns in your\nthroat itself trigeminal yeah the\ntearing of cutting an onion is a\ntrigeminal reflex amazing we talked\nabout trigeminal in the context of\nheadache during a headache episode it's\na trigeminal reflex so the lemon you are\nsmelling may have been a trigeminal\nsensation so smelling the lemon with my\neyes is what you're saying well no with\nyour nose but with your trigeminal\nreceptors and not your olfactory\nreceptors\num so in within you know all faction\nresearcher jargon uh there's what we\nrefer to as pure olfactants these are\norders that will stimulate your\nolfactory nerve alone they won't\ninfluence your trigeminal nerve at all\nand an example just to get a sense of\nwhat that might be would be uh the\ncoffee right here is a purolfactant of\nvanilla is a known plural factant these\nthings have no trigeminal activation\num but as long as we're on this topic\nand we'll weave back and forth but I'm\nglad we are on this topic because a\ntremendous number of people wrote to me\nduring the pandemic and continue to\nabout olfactory uh loss\num\nis the I I've heard of this olfactory\ntraining where whereby if you have a\npartial or even a complete loss of of\nprimary olfaction right that um one is\nencouraged to smell a number of\ndifferent smells I I grew up studying\nactivity dependent wiring of the nervous\nsystem it makes total sense to me why\nkeeping neurons active keeps them alive\nso this is not fired together wired\ntogether type thing by the way that's a\nquote from Carla Schatz not Donald head\nfolks or me\num but this is about keeping neurons\nelectrically active in this case\nolfactory neurons in order to maintain\ntheir connections because otherwise they\nwill die\nof action is a definite use it or lose\nit system and so that makes total sense\nand indeed there's very strong evidence\nfor success of of the training programs\nmore than the alpha lipoic acid right\nand and so that's a real thing and and\nwhat's cool about that is that you don't\nneed to go out and buy expensive things\nalthough you can of course there are\npeople who are capitalizing on this\ncommercially already but you can just\ntake things from your refrigerator or\nyour or your you know makeup cabinet or\nwhatever and smell them\nyou know attentionally and constantly\nand sniff them and and that exposure\nwill help you recover uh there's good\ndata on that by now you made that uh\npoint in passing about regeneration in\nthe olfactory system and neither one of\none of the cool things so in all faction\nyou can you can study many things\nthrough all faction indeed one of them\nis is an is neuro regeneration uh\nbecause the olfactory neurons are really\nthe only neurons that do that\nsystematically in the adult mammalian\nbrain and whether the human olfactory\nsystem shows the same level of\nregeneration as it does in in uh in\nother mammals is and was somewhat\nquestionable and I'm just bringing that\nup to share a really cool study that was\npublished in neuron I think somewhere\naround 2014\num where to address this question I just\nreally like the idea of doing that what\nthey what the authors did\num\nwas look at in in postmortem they looked\nat levels of c14 in in\nadults were exposed to Atomic Bomb\nexperiments right so you have you can\nactually look at these at these neurons\nand and time them based on exposure to\nradiation\num and that paper suggested that that\nthere's not as much turnover in the\nhuman olfactory bulb as there is in\nother mammals\nuh\nother lines of data suggest otherwise so\nthis is kind of a debated question as to\nwhat extent degeneration you have in in\nthe human olfactory system as opposed to\nother uh mammals but but that was just a\nreally cool paper I think of of doing\nthat fascinating no I I\nshould I finish the the path just so we\nhave to so so we said so so information\nthen synapses at the olfactory bulb from\nfrom uh uh the olfactory epithelium\nand\nthe pattern of that synapsing follows\nwhat's referred to as the most extreme\ncase of convergence in the mammalian\nnervous system more specifically what\nhappens is that all the receptors of a\ngiven subtype and remember in humans we\nsaid we have about 350 in the mouse we\nhave about a thousand two hundred\nprobably\nso all the receptors of one subtype\nconverge to one location in the bulb and\nthis location is referred to as a\nglomerulus or an employee and and that\nmay be a slight oversimplification it's\nin fact two glomeruli there is a mirror\nsort of a mirror cut line and so all the\nreceptors of one subtype will converge\nto two mirror glomeruli on the olfactory\nbulb so you end up having uh two\nglomeruli that reflect that one receptor\nsubtype\nand so if and this is as far as I'm\ngiving you now the textbook view of of\nhow the system works but then I can I'll\nhappily share with you things that\npose a problem for the textbook view of\nhow things work but the textbook view of\nhow things work is that every such\nreceptor subtype is responsive to a\nsmall subset of different molecular\nshapes what sometimes referred to as\nautotopes the molecular aspects of\ndeodorant so each receptor is is\nresponsive to a different subset of\nodotopes let's say 10 and each ototope\nwill activate a different subset of\nreceptors so potentially you have this\ninsane common and torics of this\npotentially 350 dimensional space in the\nhuman potentially\nbut then because of this convergence you\nend up having on the bulb in a way a map\nreflecting or receptor identity so so\nlet's say this coffee activates\nreceptors of type 1 3 and 7 so the\nglomeruli of receptors one three and\nseven will light up quote unquote when I\nsmell the coffee and if you could take a\nsnapshot of that theoretically you would\nhave the map of of coffee and and so on\nand so forth this this is sort of the\ntextbook view of how the system works\nand and then information goes from the\nbulb\nto several Targets in the brain I mean\nwhat is referred to as primary olfactory\ncortex is piriform cortex and then the\nRhino cortex this is on the ventral\nsurface of the brain the lower portion\nof our temporal lobe\num and information goes there directly\nbut it also goes directly to the\namygdala it probably goes directly to\nthe hypothalamus it may go directly to\nthe cerebellum uh it goes all over the\nbrain so so information projects widely\nfrom there and as far as people\nunderstand\nthe map that may exist on the bulb\ndoesn't exist in the rest of the brain\nand the understanding of of how coding\noccurs in the rest of the brain is is\nmurky commonly one here is that the\nmemories that we have of odors are\nsomehow more robust\num than the memories of other perceptual\nevents in our life I I don't know if\nthis is true or not but um people will\nsay for instance I can still remember\nthe smell of my grandmother's hands or\nthe smell of cookies in her kitchen\nat a minimum it points to the fact that\nsmell and memory are closely linked and\nyou just mentioned a direct\num you know multi-station but\nnonetheless somewhat Direct\npath from the nostrils to the\nhippocampus one of the primary encoding\ncenters away yeah which is which is a\nremarkably short pathway considering\nthat for instance uh just by example\nbecause some of our listeners won't be\nfamiliar with this but some will that\nsound waves that uh you know are\ntransduced into neural signals at the\nlevel of the inner ear go through many\nstations before they arrive at the\nlocation in the brain where we make\nsense of those sound waves as voices or\nmusic Etc whereas olfaction is more of a\ndirect route\num to the to the memory centers\num is there any uh gesso story or real\nuh objective truth to the idea that\nolfactory memories are formed more\neasily or maintained longer or more\nrobustly than other sorts of memories so\nso yes but first I I should I should say\nthat I'm not\nan authority in all Factory memory it's\nsort of it all have to remember is a\nhuge field of research and somehow our\nlab has never really\num\ngone much into that although again the\nsame student I happened to talk about\nbefore I Sharon who's again now A\nFaculty at Tel Aviv uh\num ran a study a paper we I think we\npublished in current biology biology\ncalled the privilege representation of\nearly olfacturers associations basically\nthere's something about the first time\nyou experience a smell\nthat generates a particularly robust\nrepresentation\nmore than other sensory stimuli and and\nthat's what chain fact compared so\nthere's something about the first\nexposure to a smell\num in terms of the brain encoding that\nthat etches it into our uh being\nand and this is an effect that has you\nknow it has Echoes of course in\nliterature I mean you know the the\nbiggest cliche in this is to bring up\nthe priest effect right so the priest\neffect is when he ate the Madeleine and\nit immediately the taste and smell\nimmediately reminded him uh of of an\nevent in his childhood where where uh\nwhere the same Madeleine uh appeared uh\num but but so that's something very real\nthere there's a lot of research on it uh\nnot coming from our work so I'm not an\nauthority but it does sound like there's\nsomething special about olfaction\num and that doesn't mean that there\nisn't something special about Vision or\naudition each one has its own uh unique\nuh I'm the last argue that there's\nsomething special about actions my\nstudents make fun of me because\nthey saying there's some truth to that\nthat I try to explain everything through\nthe olfactory system I mean for me\neverything is olfactory so so yes\nthrough the lens of the nose I'd like to\ntake a quick break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors athletic greens athletic\ngreens now called ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that covers all\nof your foundational nutritional needs\nI've been taking athletic green since\n2012 so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast the reason I\nstarted taking athletic greens and the\nreason I still take athletic greens once\nare usually twice a day is that it gets\nto be the probiotics that I need for gut\nhealth our gut is very important it's\npopulated by gut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain the immune\nsystem and basically all the biological\nsystems of our body to strongly impact\nour immediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 when I\nwas at Berkeley\nI was walking across campus one day and\nI saw\nI think students but I saw people on\ntheir hands and knees with goggles on\ngloves on and\num I think their mouths were covered too\neverything was covered was covered and\nthey were walking well they were\ncrawling along the ground\num and I thought this was peculiar but\nthen again it's UC Berkeley and the joke\nis if it to get noticed on the UC\nBerkeley campus you have to be naked and\non fire right one or the other would not\nbe sufficient please don't run this\nexperience that kind of place\num yeah but nonetheless a paper came out\na few years later\ndescribing the results of what turned\nout to be your experiment that your\nlaboratory was running which was having\npeople follow an odor trail with their\nnose and\num and my understanding is that people\ncan improve their ability to track sense\nquite robustly especially if\nwe deprive them of vision and somatic\nSensation that is touched in some other\num Sensations maybe you could just tell\nus a little bit about that study and um\nand for I think in our audience I'm\nsuspecting that many people have a Keen\nKeen sense of smell very I have a family\nmember who just like detect any negative\nyou know putrid odor in the environment\nbut also good odors\num exquisitely well and I I have other\nfamily members who sense of smell is\nquite poor\num\nI'd love for\nall of those people to learn a bit about\nwhat is possible in terms of training up\nor improving our ability to smell and\nperhaps in the context of that study if\nyou will yeah so so first before even\ntalking about improving just\noff the bat humans have a remarkable\nsense of smell and this is something\nagain in our lab we already said we know\nyeah we know this this is old news but\nbut to people who who come from\ndifferent worlds we have to reiterate\nthis sometimes when I give you know\npublic lectures to to non-all-faction\naudiences I reiterate this\nhumans have an utterly remarkable sense\nof smell to put that a bit into sort of\nyou know things that you could that are\ntangible so so for example\num mercaptans which are added to cooking\ngas so that we smell it because\notherwise it wouldn't have a smell so\nthat the smell of gas is not the smell\nof gas of propane it's an additive\nyeah it's more Captain the sulfur like\nsmell so so uh our detection threshold\nthat is the level at which we can detect\nit is 0.2 parts per billion\nokay there's no machine that can really\ndo that that effectively no gas\nchromatograph nothing now to give you\nanother sense of of making this again\nreally tangible we're working with an\nodorant in our lab called estro tetra\nenol\nthat our participants can detect when we\nhave it mixed at 10 to the negative 12\nmolar in the liquid phase to give you a\nreal sense of that we did the math if\nyou would take two olympic size swimming\npools and you would pipe it 1ml one drop\ninto one pool versus the other you could\nsmell the difference between the pools\nincredible that's the detection\nthreshold that you have with your nose\npeople have an utterly amazing nose Okay\nso so that's just in terms of its\ndetection abilities which are are just\nyou know remarkable really up there in\nthe mammalian World we're not\na bad mammal at all faction\num\nand and\nbeyond that we can we can improve okay\nand and the example you're talking about\nactually started off\nuh is a lab bet okay we were having a\nlab picnic so I guess I should hear fill\nin because I I'm your guest from The\nWeisman Institute of Science in Israel\nbut before going back to my home in\nIsrael I was a uh um faculty at UC\nBerkeley and the Helen Wells\nNeuroscience Institute and this study\nwas done during that time and we were on\na lab picnic and we were having indeed\none of these sort of lab discussions\narguments on what humans can and can't\ndo with their sense of smell and and I\nsaid that humans could truly even track\nodor like a dog and people there said no\nway and we ran this quick experiment uh\nwhich I have video of but I don't think\nwe'll show it here uh but I actually\nhave original the picnic video we have\nit\nand uh a graduate student by the name of\nChristina zellano a brilliant graduate\nstudent at that time who's now she's now\na professor at Northwestern\nand she's really leading the field of\nall faction Imaging today but she was\nthe volunteer and we dragged a chocolate\nbar across the grass and blindfolded her\nand\nchecked if she could track the track we\nmade with the chocolate which he did\nvery effectively right and as far as\nPlacer at the starting point of the line\nor I think we did I don't exactly\nremember what we did on that sort of\npicnic uh tryout but you know I assume\nshe never practiced that in her life\nbefore right and yet you know she she\ndid it really really well and\nand then this went on as a lot better in\na way that that I I said to my my\nstudents okay we we have to make this\ninto an experiment put in an\nexperimental setting and and and\nquantify what's going on\nuh\nand they all said that it would be\nuninteresting that was the BET and and I\ntold them it would be in nature which is\na bit I won in this case nature of\ncourse being one of the the three Apex\njournals so it was it was Nature\nNeuroscience to prepare but but uh so so\nthen we we turned it into an experiment\nand and what the experiment was is that\nwe brought in participants naive\nparticipants not not graduate students\nfrom our lab uh completely deprived them\nof any other sensory input so we blocked\ntheir eyes we block their ears we\nblocked everything we blocked they were\nwearing heavy gloves uh you know they\nthey couldn't sense anything\nand we generated a a consistent order\npath in the grass which is what you saw\nwe did that by burying twine under the\ngrass and odor impregnated twine so that\nway we could generate a consistent uh\nodor Trail every time was it and at the\nbase of the grass or in the dirt it was\nburied it was buried under the grass\nreally yeah\nyeah wow and I did not know that it was\nburied under the grass\nand we conducted aerial photography and\num participants also had this sensor\npack that they were wearing where we\nmeasured nasal airflow in each nostril\nin real time\nand uh they all we also used something\ncalled rtk GPS which is a way to lay uh\nradio frequency grid over the GPS grid\nso that you have millimeter resolution\nin space basically it's used by\nsurveyors mostly\num so that we could track Behavior and\nwe found a few things doing this one is\nthat people could just do this right off\nthe bat\num the second thing we found that is\nwhen we train them up\nthen within uh average of four days uh\nthe rate limiting factor became the\nspeed at which they could crawl\nso as fast as you could crawl you could\nsend track of course you can't crawl as\nfast as the dog can run but you as fast\nas you can crawl you can send track\nand then to sort of add what made it\nreally interesting from from a systems\nneuroscience perspective\nis\nthat we asked where they're having two\nnostrils uh contributes to this\nso we built we constructed a nasal\nprosthesis if you will\nuh that had two versions one is that it\ncombined both nostrils into one big\nnostril\ncentered and the other is that it\nmaintained two separated uh nostrils and\nwe compared performance under these two\nconditions and people perform better uh\nwith two nostrils over one centralized\nnostril although the flu remain the same\nso you're taking advantage of the\ninformation uh that comes from your two\nseparate totally separate nostrils by\nthe way the system I described before of\nyour epithelium and bulb and and\nconnection to Cortex\num you have two of those right it's\ncompletely unilateral well almost\ncompletely unilateral system there's\nsome\nvery small exceptions to that but but so\na representation on both sides of the\nbrain much in the same way we have two\neyes we're not a cyclops we can gain\ndepth perception information we can\nperceive motion better as a consequence\nand a number of depth especially\nstereopsis and we can locate sound\nbecause of the difference between our\nears and how head blocks them between\nand amazing another question about the\nthe mechanics and strategies that you\nobserved because I think there's\ninformation about the system the brain\nas a consequence\num were you in a position to measure\nsniffing frequency and the specific\nquestion I have is were people doing\nsomething along the lines of a\nquick sniffing or a like a you know a\nlong um withdrawal in so inhale you know\nwe didn't so yes we were measuring\nsniffing and recording it and and we\nhave all the data\num\nthere was nothing\num very remarkable in that data in that\nstudy although it may reflect that we\ndidn't analyze it carefully enough as\nwell I mean it didn't it was it it\nwasn't a major component of our analysis\nalthough we did look at it uh to some\nextent again you're asking me about a\npaper from quite a few years ago so I\nmay be forgetting parts of it as well\num but I'm sure if it was a major\ncomponent of it it would have risen it\ndefinitely wasn't a major finding of the\nsniffing behavior\num in the paper although again we you\nknow sniffing behavior is a huge portion\nof our our life in lab uh\nand and it's it's taking us to to places\nand and it's re-emerging now in our work\nwe're doing tons of sniffing work\num you know I can share with you\nsomething\nthat that I think will interest your\nyour uh listeners and viewers as well\nand and and\nwe think is is really uh one of the most\noverlooked things\nin in neuroscience\nI invite you to do the following\nexperiment so occlude one nostal by\npressing on it from the side and sniff\nin and then include the other and sniff\nin do you sense a difference in flow yes\nokay do you know why that is no and it\nwas the next question on my list so\ndon't feel badly about not knowing why\nthat is\num most people don't\nuh but that is a reflection of something\nreferred to as the nasal cycle\nso in fact if you were to do that\nrepeatedly you would find that your high\nflow nostril and low flow nostril\nalternate every two and a half hours on\naverage in an absolute way or is it kind\nof like a sine wave like gradual shift\nto the one and then gradual shift back\nit can vary it can vary and we don't yet\nknow the rules uh all the rules but but\nyou have this constant shift from side\nto side the shift becomes incredibly\npronounced in sleep so we can measure\nthe power of the difference and in sleep\nyou have this phase shift of power you\nhave a huge like one closes and one\nopens totally\nand\nit turns out that this is linked to uh\nbalance in the autonomic nervous system\nso as you and your listeners know we\nhave an autonomics nervous system that\nhas a sympathetic and parasympathetic\ncomponent to it and and they're in\nbalance or imbalance in many diseases\nfor example and this interplay between\nthe uh Auto between the the sympathetic\nand parasympathetic nervous system\ndrives the switch\nfrom left to right nostril just to\nremind people um sympathetic nervous\nsystem has nothing to do with sympathy\num has everything to do with generating\npatterns of alertness it's sometimes\ncalled the fight or flight system but\nany pattern of arousal positive or\nnegative and then it's balanced in a\ncoordinated way or at least in parallel\nwith the parasympathetic nervous system\nwhich is sometimes called the rest and\ndigest system but as a associated with\nall sorts of things the sexual arousal\nresponse and a number of other aspects\nof our physiology so think of it like a\nseesaw of alertness and calm yeah\nperfect so now imagine right imagine\nimagine you would walk around living\nyour life right half of the time with\none eye closed like this and the other\nhalf with one eye closed like this and\nyou have this eye cycle all right and\nthat was linked to autonomic arousal I\nassure you you would go to PubMed there\nwould be five million papers on the eye\ncycle right and the eye cycle in every\ndisease you can name and what it denotes\nand what it tells us and what we can do\nwith it\nyou have exactly this marker you're\nwalking around with a marker on balance\nin your autonomic nervous system and we\ndo nothing with it so we're in fact now\ndoing a lot with it okay so we built we\nbuilt a wearable device\nthat is pasted to your body and measures\nairflow in each and nostrils separately\nand logs it for 24 hours\nand we're collecting these 24-hour\nrecordings we're calling it the nasal\nhalter\nso we measure with the nasal halter\nand and we're finding it as a disease\nmarker\num I can I can give you a nasal halter\nmeasurement as an adult and I can say\nthis is work by team nasaroka graduates\nin our lab now I can so we can tell the\ndifference between ADHD and non-adhd\nadults\nand we can tell just from the recording\nwe can tell if the adults are in ritalin\nor not\nso I can I can measure your nasal\nairflow and say if you are or are not\nwith ADHD and if you are or not on\nRitalin incredible I have a couple of\nquestions about this\nis it the case that airflow through one\nnostril is reflective of a sympathetic\nnervous system dominance versus\nparasympathetic\num or is it simply the case that this\nalternating Left Right nostril\nperiodicity\num which you said I think is on the\norder of about every two hours two and a\nhalf two and a half it switches to uh\nmaximal on one side versus the other\nis that simply reflective of an overall\nbalancing let's maybe is it the hinge in\nthe Seesaw or is it the tilt of the\nSeesaw so I don't have a good answer I\ndon't have a good answer I mean you know\nI could give you sort of a you know I\ncould say that to some extent uh uh\nright nostril more open\num is more sympathetic and the left\nnostril more open is more\nparasympathetic but that that wouldn't\nbe very correct I mean you know I'm sure\nthat it's you know the yogis are going\nto be all over this so right because I\nget this my lab does do some stuff on on\nbreathing and the the yogis are always\nsaying okay you know because there's\nthis thing I don't do yoga anymore but\nnot for anybody but um where they'll\nhave you breathe through one nostril or\nthe other and I've I've probably even\nasked this question on social media\nI'm gonna become Public Enemy Number One\nof the yogis right now so listen we so\nwe we they'll come at you with um yoga\nmats which are not very dangerous we\nreally so since we're so interested in\nthis mechanism one of the things we'd\nreally like to know how to do is is to\ngain control of it somehow and there's\nthis world out there of yoga who claims\nto have control over this\nso we said okay let's bring like really\nserious yoga practitioners and see if\nthey can shift their nasal cycle from\nleft to right but by Will alone right\nnot by manipulating themselves somehow\nand and if yes you know we'll learn from\nthem how they do this and then we might\nyou know use this to to cure ADHD or or\nwhatnot right so\nso we posted like on all the lists of\nlike the yoga teachers and had this\nparade of yoga teachers walking into our\nlab this was one of the strangers a lot\nof Sandalwood odors and bare feet\nwhite white uh clothing and and so on\nand and so we we study I actually know\nwe studied 14 yoga teachers\nall 14 uh by you know by the conditions\nof enlistment for this uh came in saying\nthat they they can control shifting from\nleft to right uh nostril without\nplugging a nostril yeah by the power of\nthought come on\num and you know how many of 14 succeeded\nzero including including one you know\nthe most extreme one was we had this guy\nwho who you know and we're recording and\nwe know how to record this really well\nright and and he's sitting there saying\nyeah I'm switching now and I'm it's\nswitching and you know you're looking at\nthe Monitor and no it's not switching\nand and so no no yoga teacher that we\nfound uh could uh willfully switch uh\nbetween left and right nostril flow and\nyet they're they are convinced that they\nare and I have to imagine they're not\ntrying to you know there's no incentive\nfor them to lie right yeah no I I it\neven the opposite I mean you know this\nputs them in an awkward position once\nyeah I don't know what the deal is but\nbut none of them can do it\num given that the alternating flow\nthrough one or the other nostrils\nreflective of the autonomic nervous\nsystem has this two and a half hour\nperiodicity\nif I suddenly enter a bout of stress for\ninstance does it switch because that's\nreflective of the autonomous nervous\nsystem and the reason I'm asking this\nquestion is not because I think that's\nnecessarily important as it relates to\nstress but I'm trying to understand the\ndirection of causality in other words is\nthe unilateral smelling through or\nunilateral nostril smelling periodicity\nthey've been we named it something I\ncould think of the wrong thing I'm sure\nis that driving the shift in the\nautonomic nervous system or is it merely\nreflective of the shift so you've you've\nvery concisely now worded aim two of a\ngrant that was probably just rejected\nbut but basically we're trying to answer\nexactly uh that question and we're\ncurrently running experiments on that\nline so so we have one experiment where\nuh uh we're looking\num so we're exposing participants to\npain uh we're using a cold water hand\nexposure it's a really cool Paradigm\nbecause it it there's huge individual\ndifferences we just started this we\nbuilt the setup just now\nand you have a lot of meat to work with\nthere because there's a lot of\nindividual differences here it's capped\nin three minutes so be for safety\nreasons because you have you have\nparticipants putting their hand in in\ntwo degrees Celsius water\nbut there'll be participants who will\npull it out at like 10 seconds 9 seconds\nand then you'll have you'll have three\nminutes as well so there's lots of lots\nof uh and and already in so now I'm\nsharing pilot data with you so you know\nto to this might you know when it when\nthis ends up being published it might be\nthe opposite but so far it seems that\nthat uh the exposure to Coal generates a\nshift in the nasal and nasal balance so\nautonomic arousal can drive the shift\npotentially\num earlier you were describing the\narchitecture of these um smelling\nsystems and you mentioned these\nglomeruli where the olfactory receptors\nconverge right in the bulb and then\nlater you mentioned that the system is\nunilateral but with a mirror\nrepresentation on both sides of the\nbrain so for those who don't think in\nterms of neuroanatomy on what no one was\ndescribing is the fact that of course\nthere are two nostrils and then a bunch\nof receptors they converge in these\nglomerular but you have a mirror\nrepresentation of that on both sides of\nthe brain and that most of that\ninformation is kept on one side of the\nbrain or the other there isn't a lot of\nextensive intermixing at the first order\nof process so the question I have is\nwhether or not you believe I'm not\nasking for data first I just want to\nknow what you believe that this\nalternating nostril airflow phenomenon\nhas anything to do with preferential\nprocessing of olfactory information in\nterms of right brain left brain with the\ncaveat that anytime we hear right brain\nleft brain\num we've covered this in a previous\nepisode most of what people hear out\nthere about right brain left brain\nemotionality logical stuff is completely\nwrong completely wrong doesn't exist is\na total fabrication\num and we'd like to abolish that myth\nbut with that aside or set aside rather\nwhat are your thoughts on why the\ninformation would switch from one side\nof the brain to the other at all yeah I\ndon't think I don't think\nthat that the nasal cycle is an\nolfaction story\num so so I I don't think that\num\nthat this was shaped by the olfactory\nsystem nor do I think this has major\nimpact on olfaction\nI think the nasal cycle story is a\ndifferent story about brain function\num so so you know we have we have this\nsort of\npet Theory where calling now the the\nsniffing brain approach\nwhere\nwhere basically\nwe think that that nasal inhalation\nis timing and driving a lot of aspects\nand patterns of of neural activity and\ncognitive processing and and this theory\nis is all faction inspired in its\nbeginning that is I mean if you think of\nthe mammalian brain right it's\nwhich which\nevolved from all faction it's sitting\nthere and an in all faction because\nolfaction depends on sniffing you have\nthis situation where you have a you have\na sniff you have information\nand then flat nothing right and then you\nhave information and then nothing so\ninformation processing is is one-to-one\nlinked to nasal inhalation\nand and we think that that\nthis property evolved\nto to be meaningful in brain processing\nin general not only of olfactory\ninformation but of any type of\ninformation because the brain evolved in\nthis way in this way that it processes\ninformation on inhalation onset\nso\na study led by offer Peril from our our\nlab uh two three years ago\num we looked at something completely not\nall Factory we looked at visual spatial\nprocessing and we compared visual\nspatial processing on inhalation versus\nexhalation\nand the brain does this completely\ndifferent on inhalation versus\nexhalation you're in that particular\ntask people performed significantly\nbetter on inhalation versus exhalation\nwhat was the task was in an olfactory no\nno it's a visual spatial task so this is\na task where uh the the specifics of the\ntasks were\num that you see a shape and you have to\ndetermine if it's a shape that can or\ncannot exist in the real world so some\nof them were these like Usher shapes\nlike you know where where one facet\ndoesn't reach the other facet The\nImpossible figures yeah yeah but but but\nuh structural shapes not not and and so\nso a pure visual spatial task we\nintentionally went for a task that is\nnot\nconsidered a ventral temporal task in\nolfactory cortex task in any way\nand and people performed much better on\ninhalation versus exhalation and doing\nthis task was there a both nostrils\noccluded\num version where people were forced to\nmouth breathe yes\nand in this particular task they also\ndid better on mouth inhalation versus\nmouth exhalation\nbut the difference wasn't as pronounced\nas it was with nasal inhalation versus\nexhalation so I'm a big proponent of\nnasal not mouth breathing whenever\npossible for\num many health related Reasons I'm a big\nfan of the book Jaws a hidden epidemic\nuh written by colleagues of mine at\nStanford familiar with it yeah and this\nidea that uh people who mouth breathe\nexperience more colds more infections of\nvarious kinds it's not good\naesthetically or for the dentist\ndentature I never know the teeth the\ngums and stuff sorry my uh my dentist is\ngoing to come after me\num need to go to the dentist anyway the\num that nose breathing is great for your\nhealth relative to mouth so I think it's\nalso good for your cognition not only\nfor your your dental health uh I think\nthat that news breathing shapes\ncognition and and there other labs who\nare finding the same uh again uh\nChristina zellano is doing work on this\nline she she had major contributions\nhere and and yuan lundstrom is doing\nwork on this line there's lots of\nstudies suggesting that\num nasal inhalation is timing cognitive\nprocessing and modulating it\nincredible um perhaps not surprising\ngiven what you've taught us about the\nolfactory system I mean that these two\nholes in the front of our face these\nnostrils I mean are\na pathway to the brain right I I love to\ntell people because I work on the visual\nsystem in my lab that you know your eyes\nare two pieces of brain extruded from\nthe cranial Vault right which they are\nthe retina is any anyhow and um and then\nyou never look at anyone the same way\nagain it's okay but the the olfactory\nSensory neurons are right there at the\ntops of those Caverns that we call\nnostrils and they are brain yeah\ndefinitely it's it's the only place\nwhere your brain meets the outside world\nbecause in your retina they're protected\nby by a lens and here here you have\nneurons in contact with with the world\nthis this actually has been the source\nfor some\ntheories on a potential uh route for for\nneurodegenerative\num mechanisms so as as you may know\num loss of the sense of smell is one of\nthe if not the earliest sign of\nneurodegenerative disease\nso for example in Parkinson's disease\nthere's uh uh loss in the sense of smell\nprobably 10 years before any other\nsymptom\num but people have failed to make this a\ndiagnostic tool because it's\nnon-specific\nso it's not as if you could come to your\ndoctor and say I'm losing my sense of\nsmell and they'll say oh early sign of\nParkinson's because\nyou can have many reasons to lose your\nsense of smell and and so on\num\nbut but\nolfactory loss again is is an early sign\nof neurodegeneration and there's at\nleast one Theory particularly about\nAlzheimer's disease\nsuggesting that that Alzheimer's may be\nthe result of of a pathogen that enters\nthe brain through the olfactory system\num oh interesting it's it's not of\ncourse a a mainstream or widely accepted\ntheory of any type but but it just\nhighlights this notion that that the\nnose is a path to our brain\nI think these non-invasive\num readouts of potential\nneurodegeneration\num such as uh visual tests because of\nthe fact that the retinas are part of\nthe brain and loss of neurons in the\nretina is often associated with other\nforms of central generation Alzheimer's\nParkinson's Etc as it's a little more\ninvasive than what you're describing I'm\nbeginning to wonder why we don't\num get have a olfactory task every time\nwe go to the doctor\nthat would allow tracking over time\nbecause of course as you mentioned\nsomeone can lose their sense of smell\ndoes that mean they're getting\nAlzheimer's not necessarily but if their\nsense of smell was terrific the year\nbefore and it's 50 percent worse than\nactually that's a really bad sign yeah\nthat's a bad sign and so what we're\ntalking about something completely\nnon-invasive and could be relatively\nPleasant to innocuous depending on the\nodor's use so yeah so so first I can\nanswer that right and the reason that\nthat's not happened and that might that\nthat may be changing right now but the\nreason that has not happen\nis because olfaction has not been\neffectively digitized\nright so if you need to generate you\nknow really precise visual information\nyou can buy a monitor for you know 100\nbucks that is it the resolution of the\nvisual system basically and if you want\nto generate auditory stimuli really\nprecisely then you can buy an amplifier\nfor you know maybe a bit more than 100\nbucks but not that much more\nand you'll be at the resolution of the\nauditory system\nin our lab we build devices that\ngenerate orders we call them all\nfactometers which is a misnomer because\nthey don't measure anything but that's\nwhat they've always been called so we\ncall them all factometers as well\nand we've already built at least one all\nfactometer that cost a quarter of a\nmillion euro and it's pathetic right so\nit just it's pathetic it's it's slow\nit's contaminated it's nowhere near the\nresolution of your system\nso one of the reasons that's not\nhappened\nis just\nthe utterly poor control of the stimulus\nmind you to some extent it has happened\nin that there there are a standard\nclinical tests of olfaction basically\ntwo that sort of control uh the world in\nthis respect the older one is is a test\ncalled the upsit which stands for the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania smell\nidentification test\nit was developed by Richard Dodie and\nPenn and it's a test where you scratch\nand sniff and it's a four alternative\nforced choice test with 40 odorants so\nyou have these 40 pages that you page\nthrough and you sniff and smell and and\num you know it's been normed on\ngazillions of tests\num\nI I'm always amused by it because so\nRichard Dodie made a ton of money uh on\nthe upsit but he needed it because he\nhas a habit he has a NASCAR so this\nevery time we buy upsits and live I said\nthere's another gallon of gas into\nRichard he races NASCAR it's not not\nlike NASCAR but like one lower than that\nlike I don't know like some some sort of\nformula a or formula for it or something\nhe races a car and so that's where all\nthe ubsites went so I always feel good\nabout buying either PSATs because I know\nthey're going to that good cause but\nkeeping him in in in the fast lane yeah\nbut but so so that's one test that's out\nthere and indeed you know has been shown\nas a you know so there's reduced upsit\nand Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and and\nthen a host of other diseases and\nthere's a European version called\nsniffing sticks\nhas developed and and it's it's\nbasically the same sort of concept of\nthat one isn't scratch and sniff it's\nlike these pens that you open up and and\nsniff but but those exist but\nthey're not as as convenient as as uh\nis delivering stimuli and vision and\naudition and that's why you don't have\nwhat you've just suggested\nyou know another thing another place\nwhere you don't have it which which I\nthink is even more would have been even\nmore meaningful is\nis you don't oh actually it's not tested\nin in newborns right where vision and\naudition is\nyou know there's this thing called\ncongenital anosomia right which is being\nwithout the sense of smell from birth\nsupposedly in general\nuh which is a half a percent of the\npopulation\nit's not a trivial number not totally\nyeah\nbut nobody knows if that really is true\nbecause here's an amazing factoid guess\nthe average age at which can General and\nosmia\nis diagnosed and this is this is a\nhorrible statistic for me for the way I\nsee the world but what do you think the\naverage age of diagnosis is for\ncongenital anosmia five years of age 14.\nincredible 14. so most people who are\none half of a one percent of the human\npopulation presumably yeah is uh without\nthe sense of smell and doesn't realize\nthat until they're 14 years old well I\ndon't know when they realized it first\nbut but it's formally diagnosed at 14 on\naverage which means some of them even\nlater right and um and uh right it's a\ndistribution well what um do they suffer\nyes so so first of all\nthey they suffer socially\num and there's a host of of deleterious\nlife events associated with congenital\nanosmia\num the the die younger\num the so it's it's it's uh it's this is\nwork out of uh Ilona Croy in Germany\num and you know amongst the various\nthings that are predicted by an osmia is\nshorter lifespan uh but things like you\nknow reduced uh social contacts uh\nreduced\num romantic social contacts\num it's not a good thing\num and and do they lack olfactory bulbs\nI'm presenting they have noses and\nnostrils there is a condition I'm aware\nof where where uh children are born\nwithout no very rare yeah very rare\nfocus on that because it's exceedingly\nrare\num but they're born with noses and\nnostables um and here's the thing right\nwe don't know if they're born with\nolfactory bulbs\num most of them although not all of them\nbut most of them don't have olfactory\nbulbs in adulthood or or I should\nrephrase that have remnants olfactory\nbulbs really shriveled olfactory bulbs\nbut you know nobody can say the cause\nand effect here before we talk about the\nrole of the the uh requirement for\nolfactory bulbs for olfaction a very\ninteresting topic in its own right I I'm\ncurious as to whether or not their\nendocrine system is altered because as\nwe'll soon talk about there's a lot of\nsignaling through the nose\nfrom between individuals that uh\ntriggers things everything from the\nonset of puberty to feelings of romantic\nattraction attachment these sorts of\nthings\num is it known whether or not and I\nshould say excuse me for interrupting\nmyself but as long as I'm interrupting\nyou every five minutes I might as well\ninterrupt myself too that um we are well\naware of the proximity of the olfactory\nsystem to some of the hypothalamic\nsystems that regulate the release of\ngonadotropins which control testosterone\nand estrogen production Etc so um are\nthey uh hormonally normal so some are\nand some aren't and I'll I'll be\nspecific so\num there's a condition known as common\nsyndrome\nwhich is hypogonadic development\num in in men\nand in Kalman syndrome uh they're\npractically all announcement\nso so to answer your question yes\nthere's a direct link and and it\nmaterializes in common syndrome that\nsaid not all congenital anosomic uh\nindividuals have common syndrome\nand not all but almost all people who\nhave common syndrome are in osmaker so\nso common syndrome uh goes with uh\nanosmia I think so there is a female\nequivalent of Commons or I don't\nremember its name uh it's not turn it's\nnot a in the Turner syndrome family I'm\nnot sure okay and I think it's also\nassociated with anosmia uh but I'm not\nconfident of that but Commons is is\nassociated with an osmia uh so so the\nanswer is is yes and and you know we can\nmaybe you know\nof action and reproduction are are\ntightly linked and and they're tightly\nLinked In all mammals and we are big\nterrestrial mammals and all fashion\nreproduction are linked in humans as\nwell\num yeah we will definitely get into that\nI'd like to just take a brief moment and\nthank one of our podcast sponsors which\nis inside tracker inside tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals I've\nlong been a believer in getting regular\nblood work done for the simple reason\nthat blood work is the only way that you\ncan monitor the markers such as hormone\nmarkers lipids metabolic factors Etc the\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth one major challenge with blood\nwork however is that most of the time it\ndoes not come back with any information\nabout what to do in order to move the\nvalues for hormones metabolic factors\nlipids Etc into the ranges that you want\nwith inside tracker changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard\nthat you can use to address the\nnutrition-based behavior-based\nsupplement-based approaches that you can\nuse in order to move those values into\nthe ranges that are optimal for you Your\nvitality and your longevity inside\ntracker now includes a measurement of\nApril lipoprotein B so-called APO B in\ntheir ultimate plan APO B is a key\nmarker of cardiovascular health and\ntherefore there's extreme value to\nknowing your apob levels if you'd like\nto try inside tracker you can go to\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside trackers plans again\nthat's inside tracker.com huberman to\nget 20 off I have a story slash question\nthat I'd like to\num tell you ask you as a segue to that\nnoting of course that we'll get back to\nthe the requirement for olfactory bulbs\nyes or no for olfaction uh and um this\nreally so when I was growing up I grew\nup at the uh end of a street with a lot\nof boys of my age who just by\ncoincidence had a lot of older sisters\nwere my sister my older sister's age it\nwas fortunate so I had a lot of kids to\nplay with we would hang out at each\nother's houses bike build jumps and do\nall those things like kid stuff Fort\nstuff\nget into trouble or whatnot\nand oftentimes we would end up leaving\nour articles of clothing at each other's\nhouses all the time like t-shirts and\njackets and so my mom was constantly\ncoming in and saying there's all there's\nthis close like someone left us here I\ndon't know who it was we were all more\nor less the same size and\nfrom the as far back as I could remember\nsix seven years old and onward I could\npick up a shirt or a jacket smell it and\nsay oh well that's Eric eisenhart's\nshirt a friend of mine there I just gave\nhis name or oh that's Scott Madsen shirt\nI I could just smell the shirt and in a\nconscious way know who it belonged to\nhaving never I promise not that I would\npretend if I had if I had\num pretend I hadn't if I had but having\nnever actually done the exercise of\ngoing and taking and smelling my friend\nintentionally right okay in fact if\nanything I had all the reasons in the\nworld to avoid smelling to other young\nboys in my neighborhood okay so yeah\num that raises the question of whether\nor not we are consciously and or\nsubconsciously\ncoding identification of people that we\ninteract with frequently or infrequently\nin terms of their smell\nand or some other aspect of their um\nchemistry yeah\nso yes\num\nwe're doing that all the time in my view\nand a lot of this processing almost all\nof it is subconscious and I don't know\nwhy already already put that out there\nright I have no idea why why uh Human\nNature has has uh or nature or culture\nor whatnot has has pushed this into the\nrealm of of subconscious and something\nwe're unaware of\num but we do it all the time and\num\nin our lab has lots of studies on this\nfront\num one of them you may be familiar with\nit that had gained some notoriety\nbecause it's amusing\num so we\nwe look at human behavior a lot we try\nto look at it through our news and in\nthe way we look at what people are doing\nyou know we try to think you know if I\nwas a dog\nwhat what would I think of this and and\nyou know if you look at dogs right\nthey've you know when they interact they\nvisibly sniff each other it's very\nobvious they walk up to each other and\nthey sniff each other\num\nand yet humans don't typically walk up\nto a stranger and carefully sniff them\nright I mean it's we're sort of obliged\nto sniff our our babies that's\nconsidered almost something you're\nsupposed to do\num and it's not culturally taboo to\nsniff our loved ones it sort of doesn't\nseem like an odd thing to do\nbut we don't sniff strangers right well\nor do we so we're finding more and more\nmechanisms where we do this and the one\nI'm referring to now for one example is\nwe started looking at handshaking\nhandshaking is this really odd behavior\nand it's not only in the west by the way\nsome people think it's only a western\nthing it's not it's almost everywhere\nand and\nthere's really poor understanding of how\nthis Behavior evolved like where did\nwhere did this thing come from so if you\nyou know if you look for the Wikipedia\nversion right then they'll tell you that\nit's to show that you're not holding a\nweapon in your hand but there's really\nno good evidence for that it's a bit\nlike the trillion Bloodhound receptor\nstory right I mean we tried to find it\nyou know why do people say that and they\njust do and we started looking at people\nhandshaking and and we noticed or it\nseemed to us that we're noticing that\nyou know people will shake hands and\nthen we'll go like this and like for\nthose of you listening not watching them\nno um it was taking his hand and and\nwiping it on his face yeah grabbing his\nnose or touching myself yeah these\nthings these things that we do all the\ntime after a handshake well so first of\nall we do them all the time just period\nright the Baseline here is really high\nand we'll get to that in a second but\nbut but these behaviors that you know\nyou you could easily not notice right\nand and so we we asked whether that's a\nreal thing\num\nand this was a study led by John fruming\nin our lab at the time\num\nand what we did first and if you want we\ncan link so so this was published in\nE-Life and one of the nice things about\nE-Life is that it has a very effective\nway to embed videos in the publication\nso if you want we can link this to your\nsystem later on even the show note\ncaptions as a link on YouTube and the\nother for uh platforms Spotify Apple so\nso what we did is is\num we we brought in participants to our\nlab\nand we sat them in the room uh\nexperiment room\nand and told them the experiment would\nstart soon and they should wait for us\nthere they didn't know what they were\ncoming from unbeknownst to them they\nwere already being videoed uh of course\nlater on they had the opportunity to to\nnot agree to us saving the video in\nwhich case we would delete it\nimmediately or or letting us use it for\nscience or someone letting us use it for\nmore than science for for the video\nthat's now on elife\nand and we walk into the room and say\nokay just wait here I will be right back\nwith you uh to set up our experiment and\nthey would sit there for three minutes\nand during those three minutes we could\nlater quantify how much indeed they just\nby Baseline how much they touched their\nnose or their forehead or their chin or\nhow many times their hands uh reaches\ntheir face and by the way that Baseline\nis not low okay\num and then three minutes later an\nexperimenter would walk into the room\nand uh would share a consistent text it\nwould be you know we're still setting up\nour equipment in the other room uh our\nand and so just wait here and we'll be\nright back with you but in the meantime\njust wait here\nand the experimenter went through this\nlike 20 second fixed text and in half of\nthe cases it included the handshake this\nwas a new experimenter not the one who\nput them in the room so that's the first\ntime they met so it would be a little\nI'm you know so and so they would put\nout their hand and shake their hand or\nnot okay and we did all possible\ninteractions in terms of gender so we\nmatched male participants with male and\nfemale experimenters and female\nparticipants with female and male\nexperimenters and so you had handshake\nand no handshake conditions and then you\ncan quantify that behavior of the hand\ngoing to the nose after a handshake\nand there was a remarkable increase in\nthe hand going to the news after\nhandshake and this is one of the nice\ncases we the paper includes statistics\nbut you don't need statistics here just\nlook at the video it's on it's unreal\nthe video is unreal so interesting so\nthe hand goes to the nose now we did a\nfew controls here\nto verify that this is an olfactory\nBehavior one is unbeknownst into\nparticipants we measured nasal airflow\nand and people not only bring their hand\nto their nose they sniff it so and this\nis perfectly time they go like this okay\nso they're sniffing their hands and in\nan additional control study we\nmanipulated it so we built this little\nJames Bond thing of a watch on the\nexperimenter's hand they could emit an\nodor and the experimenter didn't know\nwhat odor they were emitting and they\ncould emit either a pleasant or an\nunpleasant odor and we could drive the\nself-sampling afterwards up or down so\nthis was an olfactory Behavior no doubt\nabout it I mean we're quite confident so\npeople in that case people must have\nbeen sensing the odor on their own hand\nbecause they'd Shake shook the hand of\nthe of the experimenter pleasant odor\nand they're more frequently bringing\nthat hand to their nose versus\nunpleasant odor that had been introduced\nto their own hand by the experimenter\nYeah but no I think I think they were\nsensing the the ambient odor that came\nin with the hand that That Shook and\nthen that either drove them to snip\ntheir more or less the odor cloud of the\nexpression yeah and there's an\ninteresting thing going on here too\nbecause people didn't only smell The\nHand That Shook they also smelled the\nother hand\nand and we think that there's something\ngoing on here comparing self to other\nand we think a lot of self-sampling\nmight might reflect that there's on the\nsame line and again to to link to your\nchildhood story of of uh identifying\nyour friends by by smell\num\nstudy we published just last year by uh\nin battle Ravi in our lab\num\nwhere inval came with this uh uh basic\ninterest in this phenomenon that's\nLoosely referred to as click friendships\nso people you meet and you click right\naway right you immediately become close\nfriends and this is a phenomena that you\nknow is poorly described or is poorly\nascribed in literature as as an entity\nand yet anybody will tell you they know\nwhat you're talking about right I mean\nif you tell you know if somebody you\nclick with right away you you become\nintimate within five minutes right\neverybody experienced this in their life\nyou know to some extent\nand the question is what what was there\nright what was it was it because you\nlooked the same could be was it because\nyou know you had the same sports team\nthat you liked or is there something uh\nuh deeper here and and in Buzz theory\nwas that that\num\nthat a similarity in body order May\ncontribute to this\nthat people who smell the same will\nclick in some way and so to address that\nshe actually recruited uh\num click friends from all over Israel\nshe posted all of her social media uh to\nidentify uh\npairs of friends so these are our\nsame-sex non-romantic diets so these are\nfriends men and women uh whose\nfriendship started is a click\nwhere here this becomes sensitive\nbecause it has to be a mutual click\nright later on we discovered there could\nbe one-sided clicks so if somebody's\nsure they clicked with somebody else but\nthe other person there's a name for that\nin neurology that our uh common friend\nthe late Ben Barris taught me which is\nthere's a phrase that neurologists use\nokay called sticky these are people that\ncome up to you and and start asking you\nquestions and then won't leave you alone\nthey're so-called sticky people that and\nif you ask these sticky people\num sticky in air quotes because they're\nnot physically sticky\num maybe what they could be\num you know\nwhat do you think of the per this person\nthey'll say oh they're great we're\nreally good friends and so they've made\na unilateral um click friendship yeah\nyeah and uh yes neurologists are talking\nabout you if you're if you're one of\nthese people neurologists are talking\nabout you there's a an informal\ndiagnostic code sticky so so so uh she\nshe recruited\num\num\nclick friends\nand then she sampled their body odor and\nand we have a a protocol for this so\nthey're given you know uh odorless\nshampoo and soap to use for three weeks\nor something and then they sleep two\nnights in this t-shirt uh where they\nhave to sleep alone and then we extract\nthe body odor from the t-shirt and so we\nhave a way to extract a method to\nextract body odor and then she she first\nasked\num whether indeed\nclick friends are more similar in their\nbody order than you would expect by\nchance\nand she first tested this with them with\na device a machine we call an electronic\nnose so an electronic nose is sort of a\nvery poor effort to mimic what the\nmammalian nose does basically it's a\nbunch of sensors that respond to\nAirborne molecules in this case sensors\nreferred to as moxers as a metal oxide\ncovered sensors\num\nand so she used an electronic nose to\nsample these body odors and she found\nthat click friends are indeed more\nsimilar to each other than you would\nexpect by chance by random diets and\nthis was a significant difference and\nafter she found that a device could do\nthis\nshe had other participants do this so so\nshe had people smelling the click\nfriends versus non-click friends and and\nthey judge them as being more similar to\neach other\nuh than not now again you you might\nwonder is this causal or not right\nbecause maybe click friends go to the\nsame restaurant together or all the time\nor whatever or live in the same\nneighborhood and and that's why they\nthey they smell the same so to address\ncausality she recruited total strangers\nand first smell them with the electronic\nnose and then engage them in a social\ninteraction something called the mirror\ngame so in the mirror game one person\nmoves their hands and the other person\nis really close to them like right here\nso they can smell each other and has to\nmove their hands with the other person\nand one one prediction there panned out\nuh but another didn't the one that\ndidn't so she predicted that people\nwould smell more uh similar to each\nother would be better at the mirror game\nthat is they would follow each other\nbetter that did not pan out however\nshe then also had the interaction was\ncompletely non-verbal they were not\nallowed to speak with each other and she\ndid an entire round robin so everybody\nplayed with everybody else this was an\ninsane experiment to run\nand\nand she then at the end of the\nexperiment each person raided each other\nperson as to how much they think they\nwould want to be their friends and also\non a bunch of ratings how nice they\nthink they are how affectionate they\nthink a bunch of ratings okay\nall of this was predicted by the\nelectronic news so people who smell more\nsimilar to each other think that the\nother person is more likely to be their\nfriend is more likely to be a nice\nperson etc etc so we could actually\npredict friendship using the electronic\nnews so this is not a result of\nfriendship it's it plays into the causal\nelements of of building friendship so\nthis is to relate to your childhood\nstory uh there's something going on here\nwe're constantly smelling ourselves\nconstantly this\nconstantly so I mean if you want to like\nI don't know the reason I'm smiling I\nmean and your viewers are listeners will\nunderstand why I'm smiling I'll send you\na video to link uh uh in in the in into\nyour podcast here we thought of calling\nthe the fact that people constantly\nsniff themselves we thought of calling\nthis the low effect and low so in\nAmerica this won't pass that effectively\nbut in in the rest of the normal world\nis the soccer the national soccer coach\nof the German soccer team so\nyeah I mean I don't know who would be a\nvery famous coach here but Steve Kerr I\nmean this is the choice this is a super\nsuper famous uh name all around the\nworld where soccer is the primary sport\nthat people watch\num\nand and once people will see this video\nthey'll understand why we thought of\ncalling this the low effect uh it's a\nvery graphic uh but but people are\nconstantly smelling themselves they're\nsmelling themselves with their hands\nthey're smelling themselves explicitly\npeople are constantly smelling\nthemselves constantly smelling others\num I find this topic so interesting um\nand first of all confession I definitely\nsmell myself multiple times per day and\neverybody does okay good yeah and I I um\nI would do it anyway\num uh I think I like most people I\neither find my own smell to be neutral\nto Pleasant\nright I um occasionally I'll be like\nwell I need to take a shower as long as\nwe're talking about smelling oneself and\num friendship kinship and its\nrelationship to smell we have to talk\nabout the relationship between smell and\nromantic attraction and bond so my\nunderstanding is that if for instance a\nmouse is given the option to mate with\nany number of other different mice\nthey will bias their choice toward the\nmouse that has the immune composition\nthe so-called MHC major\nhistocomatibility complex which reflects\nimmune diversity the immune system that\nis most distant from theirs and the The\nevolutionary argument being that were\nthey to\num produce offspring that the array of\nimmune genes would be much broader than\nif they were to select an animal very\nclose to them and in addition to that\nthat one of the most strongly selected\nagainst behaviors not just culturally\nbut at the level of eliciting a sense of\ndisgust\nmaybe even from the activity of the\nhypothalamus is mating with very close\nkin AKA incest because that can\npotentially we know produces a higher\nrate of mutations in other words whereas\nyou describe the relationship between\nsmell and choice of friends as you uh\nchoose people who smell more like you my\nunderstanding is that in the context of\nuh\nchoosing romantic Partners or sexual\npartners or both that you choose the\nperson who's odor and therefore immune\ncomposition is most different right so\nthe way you describe the animal\nliterature is correct\nand there's evidence to similar\nmechanisms in humans our lab has not\nworked directly on this issue of of uh\nof uh romantic selection based on odor\num there's a bunch of papers\num wedkins Ed Allen and the wedkin lab\nand also Porter I'll I'll email these to\nyou later on\num that have have done a lot of this\nwork and find exactly as you say that\nthat um um romantic order preferences in\nhumans are influenced by Body order and\nthat this is linked to MHC uh uh is the\ncompatibility complex makeup of the the\nportion of our genome that that shapes\nour immune system uh to some extent\num so so this effect\num has been studied and reported on\nagain extensively in mice and also uh in\nin humans\num\nnot work that that we've done\num\nthe one sort of\ntangent work we've done and and\nI'd like to maybe tell you about\nit relates to to an effect\nthat that is one of the most remarkable\neffects in in mammalian social chemo\nsignaling so\nand and also related to to so it's it's\nnot related to Romanticism in any way or\nor but but it's related to reproduction\nand and indeed in our lab we've not\nlooked at Romanticism we have looked at\nor are looking at reproduction\nthey're not always the same\num certainly\noh they can they can animal mammalian or\nterrestrial mammalian reproductive\nbehavior is is dominated by by the sense\nof smell\num in in mammals and here remember\ninitially when you started off I I noted\nthat there are several subsystems in our\nnews that transduce utterance and and so\nprimarily the manual factory system\nwhich is cranial nerve number one and\nthe trigeminal nerve which is cranial\nnumber five\num most terrestrial mammals have another\nsubsystem referred to as the the\nsecondary olfactory system\nthat has a separate sense organ in the\nnose this organ is known as the\nvulnerable nasal organ\nit's a small pit in the nasal passage of\nof most terrestrial mammals sometimes\nit's uh described as a communicating pit\nbecause sometimes it connects the nasal\npassage to the roof of the mouth\nsometimes it can it connects both\nand\nso there's this sense organ with its\nspecific receptor subtypes uh vnr's\nvermonasal receptors\nand uh this\num\num is linked to a to a sort of separate\nportion of the olfactory bulb not really\na manual Factory bubble it's referred to\nas the accessory olfactory bulb\num and from there directly to the limbic\nsystem to the to the portions of the\nbrain that control reproductive Behavior\nUh and aggressive behavior and\nand in most\num terrestrial mammals this subsystem\nprocesses utterance there are sometimes\nreferred to as pheromones although\nthat's in many ways a problematic term\nbut but utterance that are referred to\nas pheromones namely odorants that are\nemitted by another member of the species\nto influence that member of the species\nand alter Behavior or hormonal state\nand\nand and some of these pheromonal effects\nare are utterly remarkable and in my\nview the most remarkable of all is an\neffect known as the Bruce effect\nuh this was an effect discovered by\nMargaret Bruce in 1959 she was a British\nscientist\nand in the Bruce effect when you expose\na pregnant Mouse\nat an early critical stage of the\npregnancy\num I think up to about day three uh if\nyou expose the pregnant Mouse uh to the\norder of what is referred to in\ntechnical terms is the non-stud male\nthat is a male who did not father the\npregnancy\nshe will miscarry the pregnancy she will\nabort it\nnow that that's an insane decision made\nby the female here right because she's\ninvested quite a lot in this right in in\nbiological terms and in in forming this\npregnancy and maintaining it and yet she\ndrops it on the basis of an odor\num and this effect is remarkably robust\nand what do I mean by remarkably robust\nso this will occur\non about 80 percent of exposures now as\nyou know 80 is 100 in biology right I\nmean there's nothing that happens at\nmore than 80 percent\nso it's a remarkably remarkably robust\neffect this this dropping of the\npregnancy and we know it's mediated by\nchemosensation three no for sure and we\nknow in the following way so first it's\nenough to just bring the order of the\nnon-stead male you don't have to bring\nthe mail himself right so you just can\nbring bedding from a nonsense male and\nthat will induce uh the Bruce effect but\nof course uh the most telling set of\nexperiments is that if in the female\nMouse you ablate the vulner nasal organ\nyou just burn this tiny structure in the\nnose and the effect disappears so the\neffect is completely dependent on the\nformer nasal organ\num\nand and I find this out really a\nremarkable effect right I mean because\nagain because of the the extent of of\ncost that the female takes on here uh\nbased on on this information and smell\nnow\nhumans\nthe the sort of the going notion in all\nfaction is that humans don't have a\nfunctional vomarinasal organ\nso we don't have that functional organ\nin our nose now I'll point out we\nactually do have\nthe pit\nso the the structure or the outlining\nstructure is there\nuh but the pit that we have is\nconsidered vestigial and non-functional\nand what about this thing I learned\nabout at Berkeley uh in integrative\nbiology class that we have something\ncalled Jacobson's organ this is the same\norgan so so Jacobson Orion is the former\nnasal organ uh it's also called Jacobson\nbecause\num I think Jacobson was a military\nphysician in like the 1800s in Holland\nor something and he found it in in\nin a soldier who was operating on or\nsomething like that the the story comes\nfrom something like that but but\nJacobson organ is another name for the\nformer known as organ these are one and\nthe same the sensory organ of the\naccessory olfactory system and again the\ngoing notion is that the human Jacobson\norgan or Romanus organ is vestigial it's\nnon-functional does that necessarily\nmean that we don't have these pheromone\neffects no it does not so first of all\nwe know that lots of what are considered\npheromonal effects namely social chemo\nsegolian rodents are mediated by the\nmanual factory system we know that for\nsure\num there are several examples for this\nin mice and rats and rabbits and so on\nand so forth so so a uh these can be\nmediated by by the manual factory system\nand and I'll I'll come back to that in a\nsecond but first to finish the the Bruce\neffect\num\nand and second and and I'm going out on\na limb here uh but I'm willing to take\nthat that uh risk I'm I'm for me the\njury is still out on human vulner nasal\norgan\num the the decision or the the notion uh\nthat it's non-functional relies on about\none and a half papers\npostmortem uh looking for the nerve that\nconnects this thing to the brain and\nfailing to find it using staining and so\non and so forth but sustaining\npostmortem studies in humans are are\nnotoriously\ncomplicated\num basically you know for many reasons\none of them is that the material is just\nalways has gone through you know it's\nit's not ideally uh uh set as it is when\nyou sacrifice an animal and and\nand and study its its tissue\num so so based on on really really a\npositive studies that fail to find uh\nthis nerve the notion is that the\nstructure is vestigial uh in humans I\ndon't have any evidence that it's\nfunctional mind you but but I'm just not\nsure that it's not but\num what we do have a suspicion\nis that humans may experience something\nsimilar to Bruce effect\nso\nfirst of all humans have an enormous\num number or ratio of of spontaneous\nmiscarriage are they\num occurring more often in the first\ntrimester because you mentioned yes that\nin the Bruce effect in the mice is in\nthe first three days or so following\npregnancy which in the mouse gestation\nas I recall is about 21 days in the\nmouse you're talking about one-seventh\nof total gestation so I'm I'm not quick\nenough to to nor is it important to\ntranslate but this would be first\ntrimester yes which is indeed when most\nmiscarriage occurs now humans have again\na huge number of miscarriages and and\nthe numbers I'll soon share them with\nyou they sound odd and the reason they\nsound odd is because if if you have\nwhat's sometimes simply referred to as\nfailed implantation right this can occur\nyou know in days one two nobody ever\nknows okay so so some papers talk about\n90 of all human pregnancies end in\nmiscarriage this is counting a failed\nimplementation in day one two Etc more\nconservative studies talk about 50\npercent nobody will argue 30 okay so a\nhuge number a huge number of of uh human\npregnancies end in miscarriage\nnow out of these there's a portion\nthat are are unexplained right so nobody\nknows why I mean there are portions that\nare explained by all sorts of genetic\nfactors developmental factors and so on\nand so forth but there's also a\nproportion that are unexplained\nand and and so all I'm saying is that\nthere's there's a statistical backdrop\nor setting if you will force something\nlike a Remnant Bruce effect in humans\nnow with that in mind we we approach the\ngroup\num\nof we we enlisted a group of of they're\nnot really patients and participants in\na study of people who or couples who are\nexperiencing what is referred to as as\nunexplained repeated pregnancy loss\nso formally if you have uh two\nconsecutive uh unexplained miscarriages\nthen uh that that is sufficient for the\ndiagnosis of unexplained repeated\npregnancy loss\nhowever in our cohort of 30 we had\ncouples who experienced 12 consecutive\nunexplained repeated pregnancy losses so\nso the two the two is just the formal\nall of our cohort was like twelve five\nyou know so this is an emotional\ndifficult place to be\nand and these are couples who who are\nlosing uh their pregnancy for no\napparent reason so they've gone through\nall the tests that you can imagine of\nyou know genetic incompatibilities and\nall sorts of issues uh clotting all the\nall the the known suspects uh for for\npregnancy Lawson the the medical\nestablishment remains totally at a loss\nas to why these pregnancies aren't\nholding and so we hypothesized that that\nperhaps here there's something akin to\nto a Bruce type effect obviously it's\nnot going to be the same as in mice but\nbut something like a Bruce effect now of\ncourse at that stage we could not do\nanything causal to to test this right\nbut what we could do is to see uh you\nknow to seek circumstantial evidence to\nsee if if where there's fire maybe\nthere's smoke and what we did was we\ntested uh\nolfaction and more specifically the\nresponse to male body odor uh in in the\nthe couples experiencing\num\nuh repeated pregnancy loss and\nwe found a few things first of all if\nyou think of the mechanisms behind the\nBruce effect\nthe Bruce effect implies that the female\nhas to have a very clear memory\nof uh the following meal because if\nshe's gonna miscarry in response to the\nnon-father she has to know father\nnon-father I mean that means that\nthere's a pronounced olfactory memory at\nthe moment of mating okay and in mice\nthis has been very well characterized\nand and attributed to the Ontario\nolfactory nucleus a structure in the\nbrain\num\nbut you'd have to have this memory in\norder to make that decision\nnow so to address that and here you're\ngoing to see that you in your childhood\nstory from before stand out a bit as as\nskillful\nis that the first thing we did was just\nbehaviorally test uh whether\num\nthese women and control women\ncould identify the smell of their uh\nspouse\n[Music]\nand you might be disappointed or you\nknow it we would all are probably a bit\ndisappointed to learn that control where\nI'm in uh are very poor at this\nso so you you would think that that\nwomen would be good at identifying the\nbody order of their spouse they're not\nuh they're not far from chance\nhowever\num the uh women who experience uh\nrepeated pregnancy loss\nare more than they're they're double uh\nat their performance level so this is\nnot a Nuance effect\nuh women who who who experience repeated\nuh pregnancy loss can identify uh their\nhusbands or their spouses uh by their\nbody odor\nwith much greater Acuity than the\ntypical person double\na bit more than double and way above\nchance yeah no I I sorry I posed as a\nquestion but I meant yes with much\ngreater Acuity uh and double is is a\nsignificant\num Improvement\nare they much better at detecting any\nodor no they're not we did the controls\nand they're not\nand then\num we also measured using fmri we\nmeasured their their brain response to\nuh stranger male body odor\nand there and and and this was quite\nremarkable because you know we\napproached so this was a full brain\nanalysis so without a region of Interest\nanalysis so it's not as if you're uh\ntweaking your statistics to look at one\npart of the brain you're just looking at\nthe entire brain in the response to male\nbody order and asking de novo is there a\ndifference between these two groups of\nparticipants and there was one huge\ndifference and it was in the\nhippothalamus and so there was a\ndifference in response to stranger male\nbody order uh between the two groups\num\nso so\nolfaction is altered in spontaneous\nrepeated spontaneous uh pregnancy loss\nwe don't know this is causal right uh\nbut but\nthat was enough for us to approach the\nEthics Committee\num to run a causal experiment\num and we're at the beginning of that\nnow\nincredible I can't wait to hear the the\nresults of that it's gonna take it'll\nprobably take years\num a few because because\nthe these are slow experiments to run uh\num recruitment is complicated uh but\nbasically we're we're blocking\num\nwe're blocking smell in in uh couples\nwho are trying to maintain a pregnancy\nI want to touch on some other so-called\npheromone effects and one thing I heard\nyou say during a talk which I think\nreally captures this whole issue of are\nthere pheromone effects in humans\num very nicely as you said you know\nwhether or not it's a classic pheromone\neffect or whether or not it's olfaction\nor something else this is chemos sensory\nsignaling between individuals um the\nreason this is important to me is a few\nyears ago I did a social media post\nabout pheromone effects and animals and\nsome potential pheromone effects in\nhumans and a couple of the um human uh\nolfactionistas\num more from the the actually who work\non animal models really came after me\nwith um you know intense sniffing saying\nuh you know there is no evidence for\nhuman pheromone effects human pheromone\norgans and I think today you've\nbeautifully Illustrated how regardless\nof the answer to that\nhumans are\ncontain and are emitting chemical\nsignals that influence each other's\nphysiology and behavior for sure for\nsure and and the the term pheromone is a\nproblematic term in any case I mean the\nterm the term was\num put forth to describe insect Behavior\nright so you know if if you were given a\nhard time by the mouse people you could\nhave given them an equally hard time if\nyou were an insect person right because\nreally the place the term is is uh is\naccurate is you know so the first\npheromone that was discovered was\nbambicol which is the pheromone that has\nthe male moth follow the the scent Trail\nof the female moth\nis a pheromone\num\ninsect pheromone people will argue that\nthis stuff that people talk about in\nmice and rats is not pheromones I see\nand and it all becomes semantics yeah\nsort of like nerdy inside ball it's all\nsemantics so I don't I in our\nPublications we don't use the term\npheromone you know because it would not\nhelp me and it would probably only hurt\nus and so you know we talk about chemo\nsignals and humans definitely emit chemo\nsignals from their body\nand these chemo signals influence other\nhumans and influence their behavior you\nknow in in\nthere are several examples of this one\nof them I'll point out first\nwhich is is sort of the most widely\nstudied and and not mostly from our lab\nactually I mean the the flavor of the\nmonth for the past 10 years in this\nfield\nis what's referred to as the smell of\nfear right so\num\nthis is probably true of of many mammals\nand humans uh it's true of\num we emit a specific body odor when\nwe're in a state of fear uh this was\nfirst discovered in humans by Denise\nChen\num out of I think Brown I'm not sure\nthink that's right yep humans emit a\nparticular body odor when they're in a\nstate of fear and this body order\ninfluences other humans in effect\nincreasing uh their autonomic uh arousal\ntheir sympathetic State\num so in effect you could say that fear\nis contagious a bit so the smell of fear\nis contagious by the way culturally uh\nwe know for ages that dogs can smell if\nyou're in humans but actually that was\nonly really shown about a year and a\nhalf ago in a study so it was always\nsaid but it wasn't really shown\neffectively it was shown about a year\nand a half ago in a study the dogs\nindeed can smell human fear\num and humans can smell human fear so\nseveral Labs starting from Denise Chen\nand Javelin Jones and and then in our\nlab and in other labs if you collect\nbody odor from people in a state of fear\nuh and collect body order from the same\npeople when they're not in a state of\nfear other people can determine which is\nis the state of fear or and this\ninfluences their behavior what about the\nsmell of safety or is that simply the\nabsence of the odor corresponding to\nfear and the reason I ask this is\nsomewhat woven into our\num prior discussion about mate Choice\num again I'll ask the question in a form\nof of brief anecdotes\num I'll use the I had a friend who uh\napproach here but um well one phenomenon\nthat has nothing to do uh with me in\nparticular I think this is a common\nphenomenon is\num\nromantic Partners leaving articles of\nclothing at each other's homes now this\ncould have other purposes to Mark\nterritory but um visually marking\nterritory but also um scent marking\nterritory is very common in the animal\nkingdom\num it's not uncommon uh for uh romantic\nPartners when one is traveling or away\nfor the other partner to smell their\narticle of clothing in order to bring\nabout positive uh connotations of the\nother partner very common Behavior if\nyou're doing this folks other people are\ndoing this too yeah um it raises\nquestions for instance about whether or\nnot the morning period part post breakup\nwhether by decision by death or by\num some other phenomenon that's forced\nto break up whether or not that morning\nperiod has something to do with an\nolfactory unlearning of uh um and made\nslash and on and on and on with all\nthese insights I would offer you to be a\npostdoc well\nfinished so I would love to do it but\nit's going to kill me yeah exactly you\ndon't want me to work for you we talked\nabout this that's what I'm saying\nthat don't really work uh earlier I was\njust I was afraid of the fact that I've\nhad three incredible scientific mentors\nuh undergraduate graduate and postdoc\nbut\num for reasons uh that are unclear to me\num uh the first one died of suicide the\nsecond one cancer at 50 and the third\none\num pancreatic cancer in his early 60s\nand the last one before he died was an\nMD and a common friend of gnomes and I\nturned to me and said you know Andrew\nyou're the common denominator so um you\nknow that the joke\nso nonetheless I would love to do a\nsabbatical in your life so so what I was\ntrying to say in that round about way is\nthat those are all really Keen\nobservations and good ideas\num for sure and and and they just\nhighlight again you know that that we're\nincredibly olfactory animals you know\nand and and you're you're even talking\nabout the Nuance we're very ol' Factory\neven not in the Nuance I mean I have\nthis when people tell me that you know\nthat we don't use our sense of smell and\nwe don't need it and all that and I I\nhave to deal with this a lot right I\nhave to deal a lot you study Vision\nnobody will tell you that vision is\nunimportant right I have to visually\ndependent I don't need a dog to take\nover my olfactory system if I lose old\nfaction but I'll tell you from having\nlost my sense of smell for one day right\nI was in intense fear I bit into a blue\nI love blueberries I'm like a drive-by\nblueberry either if they're there I just\nkind of picked them up like a grizzly\nbear and cram them in my mouth so keep\nthem away from me if you don't want them\neaten but I can't I almost can't help\nmyself\num I bit into a blueberry or a handful\nof blueberries and they just it was the\nsensation of little bags of water and I\nimmediately felt like tremendous\ntremendous grief I'll tell you a sort of\na throwy line that I use in this when I\ntalk with people you know I mean you\nknow take the two most basic behaviors\nthat sustain us right let's say I give\nyou a choice\nbetween\na beautiful looking\nlayer cake with with with strawberries\nand blueberries and and uh and whipped\ncream\nbut the smells of sewage\nversus some gray brown mix that smells\nof cinnamon which do you eat oh simple\nright you eat the latter right now\nimagine I offer you a mate choose the\nthe gender of your liking right it looks\nlike a Greek god or goddess right but\nsmells of sewage\nor an ordinary looking individual that\nsmells of sin itself who do you choose\nthe latter right so in the two most\nbasic behaviors we have we follow our\nnose not our eyes right definitely not\nalways in predictable ways because you\noffered an extreme example which is the\nbest example but I for instance for\nreasons I don't know I've never liked\nthe smell of perfume ever\nin fact I find it aversive but I do I\nconfess I do like the smell of certain\nbody odors very much and I'm very\num particular about that and I know\nwithin an instant\num and so uh this is a problem for any\nromantic partner uh who likes perfume\nfor me but I know many people like\nperfumes and colognes and things and In\nfairness I've also been told\num that uh by someone that they couldn't\nspend time with me because they do not\nlike my smell in fact they dislike it\nand I unfortunately for me there's at\nleast one person on the planet who said\nyes\nso the um so I completely agree with\nwhat you're saying yeah\num I can also say that um I imprinted on\nthe smell of my I had a Bulldog Mastiff\num when I raised from the time he was a\npuppy and I imprinted on I imprinted on\nhis smell immediately and even though to\nother people it was a Bulldog Mastiff\nafter all his smell was rather averse to\nme he he smelled delicious right and it\nmade me it smelled like home and he was\nmy best animal friend for a long time so\nand on and on and on right the smell of\nchildren as you said the backs we had a\nguest on this podcast who I'm sure\nyou're familiar with Charles Zucker yeah\na professor Columbia has done incredible\nwork and vision and old-fashioned yeah\nthey're sensing it and he and I talked a\nlittle bit about this that\num there's something in the breath\nof romantic Partners\num that's hopefully a pettitive not\naversive as well as in children he was\ntalking about the smell of his\ngrandchild's the bat the nape of their\nthe back of their neck and how he misses\nthat smell because when he thinks about\nmissing his grandchild or children it's\nthat smell that that that's associated\nwith that feeling hexadecanal\nhexadecanal yes is it Charles your\ngrandchildren smell like hexadecanal yes\nhe's gonna come after me now and so this\nthis is a steady uh ran by uh Eva\nmishore who was a graduate student in\nour lab\num\nand and Eva was interested in aggression\nshe was really into aggression\num and actually when she start and and\nwhen she start off we said okay let's do\nchemo signaling of aggression\nshe actually was going to like MMA clubs\nand collecting body odors\nuh and we we had all sorts of ideas\ngoing and and she she worked on that for\nquite a bit it never went anywhere\nreally\nand then\nat the same time\nwe had a colleague of ours from Germany\nI mean when I say colleague primarily a\nfriend or acquaintance I made it\nconferences\num\nHeinz Breer\num and and um\nhe was studying in his lab\na molecule hexadecanal\num that was a chemo signal in mice\nwhere in mice it was described as a\nchemo signal that promotes social\nbuffering where social buffering as far\nas I understand it's not my field but as\nfar as I understand it's basically a\nfeel-good together thing so when lots of\nwhites are together they feel good about\nbeing in a group and that's social\nbuffering and it's promoted by\nhexadecanal which they emit in their\nfeces mice\nand in his work on hexadecanal\num and and so so Brier and his colleague\nswordsman they discovered the receptor\nfor this and then they went and\ndiscovered that the receptor is very\nhighly conserved throughout mammalian\nEvolution and therefore they\nhypothesized that maybe\num this is a universal mammalian signal\nnow which is unusual because in in chemo\nsignaling typically you tend to think of\nthings as being very species specific\nbut here they're hypothesized that maybe\nhexadecanal which promotes social\nbuffering in mice may do something in\nall mammals again because this receptor\nis very highly conserved or 37b I think\num so they so he approached us and said\nlook you got to study this stuff in\nhumans right because he knows us as the\nhuman people right I mean we go to these\nold-fashioned conferences where where\nlots of people study mice and and\nzebrafish and whatnot and we're the the\nhuman group\nso and and eventually he just fedexed us\nhexadecanal\nand and so we had this thing sitting\naround and Eva was not going anywhere\nwith her aggression studies with sweat\nfrom Human participants\nand yet she built the entire\num Paradigm to study human aggression so\ntheir standard paradigms this is a\nparadigm known as the tap the Tyler\naggression Paradigm I'll soon describe\nit\nand so we said okay we have this\nhexadecanal stuff here and it promotes\nsocial buffering social buffering sounds\nlike it would make you less aggressive\nwhy don't you run your TAP experiment\nusing hexadecanal\nwhat's the tap experiment so basically\nwhat you do is you bring in a\nparticipant to lab and you have them\num\nthinking that they're going to be\nplaying against another person in in\nthis game and you can you can do\nsomething like have another person walk\ninto the other room playing online so so\nconnected so you can fool them into\nbeing quite convinced that this is\nwhat's happening and they go into their\nown room\nand in the initial game they play\num on each round their uh they're\nprovided with a sum of money and this is\nreal money that they'll receive at the\nend of the experiment\nand by turn each one of them decides how\nto divide the money up between the two\nright so they're playing against another\nperson they think but that's actually a\ncomputer algorithm that they're playing\nagainst and the\ncomputer algorithm is is programmed to\nbe in in scientific terminology a jerk\nright so that you know like let's say\nthey have to divvy up 100 cheko which is\nthe Israeli currency so so the com you\nknow the other player would say okay you\nknow um I'll keep 96 and you get four\nright and then if you can either accept\nit\nor not accept and then neither of you\nget anything right so basically you're\nbeing shafted by by the other side all\nthe time and this is called the\nprovocation phase you're really getting\nangry at this person because they're\nthey're really not nice right they're\nthey're shafting you on every trial or\nalmost\nand you play this game and it goes to\nits end and then you click you play a\nsecond game as far as you know against\nthe same participant and the second game\nis a reaction time game so a Target\nshows up and the first to press it wins\nand on every trial where you win if you\nwant you can blast the other parts spent\nwith a loud noise\nand and it's a really loud noise so\nyou're also wearing earphones it's 90 DB\nand it's it's a screeching horrible\nsound it's the most punishment that an\nIRB committee will let you uh endure on\non a participants and experiment unless\nyou're in Stanford\n70 years ago or whatever that was I was\nreferring to the classic prisoner\nexperiment which took place in the\nbuilding next door to where I work\nso you can blast the other participant\nwith varying levels of sound and you\nhave a selection box from something very\nlow to something very high and what's\nnice about this is that it then allows\nyou to quantify aggression because the\nmore volume you're blasting the opponent\nwas the more aggressive you are towards\nyour opponent and and so you have a\nmeasure of aggression again the Tyler\naggression Paradigm obviously invented\nby Tyler uh very well validated studied\nall over you know a very standard\nprotocol\nso we broaden participants and had them\nplay uh the title of the tap uh either\nunder exposure to hexadecanal or control\nnow access that Canal doesn't it's it's\nincredibly difficult to even detect\nTexas now but just in case uh because it\nit it's not very very it's considered a\nsemi-volatile it doesn't have a strong\nsmell\num but we buried it both the control and\nthe hexadecan island in a control order\nthat hid them in a mask\nand and she ran lots and lots and lots\nand lots of participants men and women\nand I'll first tell you the result with\nmen which is that hexadecanal\nconsistently reduced aggression\npeople were less aggressive under\nhexadecanal\num the effect size was was uh uh quite\nmeaningful and later on we learned\nbecause I'm no\nspecialist in the world of aggression\nbut compared to effects seen in the\naggression World in research really\nreally strong effects so unusually\nstrong\nso hexadecanal lowered aggression in men\nand we were like well this is you know\nsort of what we were hoping to see\nconsistent with the hypothesis uh and\nconsistent with it seems to do in mice\nbut then we looked at data from women\nand hexadecanal increased aggression\nequally significantly is this thought to\nbe something related to maternal\nprotectiveness we're getting there so\nyou you got there really fast it took me\na year but and and ever got to it really\nI'll I'll tell you because remember\nwe're reaching the back of the head of\nyour of\none of the kingpins of the New York\nNeuroscience Mafia yes so\num\nso this was really odd to me at that\ntime so I didn't have the intuition you\njust had and I was like about this there\nwas some bug here I mean this this it\nmakes no sense to me you know why would\nsomething increase aggression in women\nand decrease aggression in men this is\nreally really strange\nand and I said okay I want to see this\nhappen again before you know we go ahead\nwith this so she went and did the entire\nexperiment again and this time she did\nit within the fmri magnet so that we we\ncan also uh track uh brain activity uh\nwhile this was happening\nand first of all it replicated again so\nonce again uh hexadecan element made men\nless aggressive and women more\naggressive and and the extent of more\nthan the effect alone the dissociation\nwas remarkable this has the it's almost\nlike a chromosomal test I mean you you\nlook at the data on the unit unit slope\nline and all all the men are below and\nall the women are above there's this\nfigure in the paper then she also looked\nat the brain data and this is you know\nAlthough our lab does a ton of fmri it's\none of the major tools we use to measure\nuh uh brain activity I'm I'm quite\ncognizant of the limitations of fmri\nand and this is I think sadly I think\nthe only study in my career at least\nwhere where I actually managed to also\nget a mechanism out of fmri not only\nan area that's involved in activity\nand and so here's what we saw that\nhexadecanal alone\nincreased activity\nquite pronouncedly in an area of the\nbrain known as the left angular gyrus\nnow this is an area involved in what's\nreferred to as social appraisal so that\nwas kind of cool in that a social order\nactivated the social brain not the\nolfactory system per se and and very\npronounced\nso on one hand that was cool but then\nwhat was uncool was that it did the same\nin men and women\nand this was in contrast to behavior\nwhich you don't like seeing right I mean\nbecause you would expect brain activity\nto reflect Behavior\nand it increased activity in the left\nangular gyrus in both both men and women\nbut then she did a follow-up analysis\nwhich was look at what's referred to as\nfunctional connectivity that is how does\nthis region of the brain talk with the\nentire brain as it were under\nhexadecanal versus uh control\nand here the dissociation re-emerged\npowerfully whereby the connectivity from\nthe angular gyrus was mostly to the\nclassic neural substrates of aggression\nso the amygdala and the temporal Pole\nand the connectivity went in opposite\ndirections in men and women so\nhexadecanal increased functional\nconnectivity in men and decreased it in\nwomen\nso in a way this is almost saying that\nthe default brain reaction is aggression\nright the default is to aggress and in\nmen hexadecanal increases the control\nthat the left angular virus is holding\nover your aggression and keeping you\nback and in women it let it roam free\nand they became more aggressive\nbut I was still Apostle so so I was\nconvinced this happened twice the mro\ndata provided not only a pattern but a\nmechanism which is unusual\nand yet I I was telling Eva you know but\nyou know this makes no sense to me and\nthen and then her Insight which of\ncourse afterwards is like duh it is no\nthere's a place where this makes perfect\nsense and that is if you're a mammalian\nOffspring because\npaternal aggression is often directed at\nyou there is infanticide all over and\nsadly there's male aggression towards\nhuman children as well\nand maternal aggression is often\nprotective\nso if you're an offspring if you have a\nmolecule that will make your mother more\naggressive in your daddy less aggressive\nboth of those are good for you so you're\nwinning\nso we remembered a recently published\npaper from a group in Japan\nthat looked at the odors emanating from\nbaby heads we now come full circle to\nsucker's grandchildren\nthey used a method known as gcms gas\nchromatography Mass spectrometry to\nmeasure the volatiles from baby heads\nbecause baby head odor is a cultural\nthing across cultures even in Japan\nand so we quickly went to that paper and\nto see if one of the molecules that\nreport is hexadecanal and we were very\ndisappointed that it wasn't one of the\nmolecules they reported in the paper\nand so we wrote to the authors who are\nsince then our co-authors uh and we said\nlook you know we're studying uh this\nmolecule hexadecanon we don't see in\nyour results and and we were wondering\nmaybe you had some results that you\ndidn't publish or some supplementary\nmaterials or whatever\nand this lab which is a hardcore GC lab\nsaid no no hexadecanal is a\nsemi-volatile which we knew uh in our\nprevious paper was not directed to the\nsemi-volatile range but we can now do\nuse what's called gcx GC WGC that is\ndirected at semi volatiles and we can do\nthis again we just uh studied 11 babies\nand we can we can see if this is an\nissue so he said yeah please do uh the\nbottom line of all this is that\nhexadecanal is the most abundant\nsemi-volatile in baby hits It's tons of\nit coming out of baby hits so babies\nagain speaking about if humans do or\ndon't chemo single babies are conducting\nchemical warfare right they're they're\nthey're\nyou know reducing\naggression in their fathers or males\naround them and increasing aggression in\ntheir mothers or females around them and\nboth of those things are good for them\nincredible\nthis is somewhat different than what\nwe're talking about\num and yet similar in other ways because\nit's uh built off of anecdotal evidence\nbut it's anecdotal evidence that you\nhear all the time and yet when you look\nin the scientific literature at least by\nmy read\nthe data are not clear maybe even\ncontradictory and that relates to the\ncoordination of menstrual cycles among\nco-housed yeah women or women who are\nfriends the you know many women\nlistening to this and maybe some men who\nare aware of of this effect will say oh\nyeah absolutely when I spend time with\nmy friends or go away camping or even\nspend a day with them our menstrual\ncycles become coordinated\nhowever\nmy understanding is that the early\nliterature Barbara McClintock correct\num discovered this phenomenon published\na paper in science as an undergraduate\n1971 nature amazing nature paper again\none of the three Apex journals and as an\nundergrad fantastic so discover this\ndescribe this and probably women all\nover the world who became aware of this\none way or another probably probably\nsaid yes absolutely this gives\nvalidation to what we've observed over\nand over again and yet as subsequent\npapers have been published this result\nhas been called into question is uh is\nthere any uh final word on whether or\nnot menstrual cycles uh become\ncoordinated among women who spend time\ntogether and if so is there any role of\nolfaction in this uh or chemosensing\nthrough the nostrils or end or mouth\num to support this idea so so yeah so so\nI'll start off indeed to Echo uh the\nbackground is that this study was\nconducted by by Martha McClintock when\nshe was an undergraduate Wesleyan\nCollege uh and she noticed that she\nthought her menstrual cycle and her\nco-inhabitants in her dorm room\num\num were coordinated in time\num and I should say that this comes on\nthe basis of similar or related type\neffects in rodents now ruins don't have\na menstrual cycle like humans do\num but but\num\nthere's a an effect in runes referred to\nas the whiten effect which\num resembles uh this type of of effect\num and she published indeed that paper\nas an undergraduate in nature in 1971\nand to answer your question she\npublished a follow-up in 1998 also in\nnature uh with then her graduate\nstudents Chicago uh Stern so this is\nStern and McClintock 1998 and here's\nwhat they did they collected\num sweat from donor women\nand deposited it on the upper lip of\nrecipient women so this would be a fun\nexperiment for you at least because you\nsaid you like body orders but for many\nothers perhaps it would be daunting well\nI like certain body orders from certain\nindividuals\num I don't know I don't think I\nuniformly like all body orders although\nI do send a uniformly not like the smell\nof perfume although I should just to\nclarify because I put this out there and\nI learned the hard way in the comment\nsection on YouTube some of those\nperfumes I find downright aversive yeah\nlike it's a uh I think the great Marcus\nMeister who a great neurobiologist once\nsaid there's basically three responses\nit's either yum yuck or meh so some are\ntrue yeah I've never heard that one yeah\nthat one right in terms of the animal\nbehavior yeah\nor pause\num so some are truly a yuck\nsome many are meh zero to date\nor\nyum for me now body odors the\ndistribution is shifted it could be any\none of those three yum yuck or meh so\njust to be clear but the the um yum\ncategory is definitely included\nthank you\nso uh um\nso so she did this study so so because\nright in the original McClintock study\nyou might suspect other uh drivers of\nthe effect let's see if you accept the\neffect but still there might be other\nsocial drivers of the effect there are\nnot body odor right there might be some\ndominant woman who's dominant in some\nother way and this might be driving the\ncoordination right so here there was no\ndirect link between these women other\nthan body orders so if the effect\nre-emerged\num it would definitely be an olfactory\neffect and what she found is that if she\ntook a sweat from the follicular or the\novulatory phase of the donors one\nextended the cycle in recipients and one\nshortened the cycle in recipients I\ndon't remember which was which but but\nbasically uh uh definitely denoting uh a\nchemo signaling effect uh with with the\nopposing uh effects on duration based on\nthe time it was collected from\nagain published in nature in 1998.\nthat's it I I there's a quotation I\nthink this is from from\nuh\nI'm not sure but but you know that that\nuh uh if something is published in\nnature or science that doesn't\nnecessarily mean it's not true so uh\nwith that in mind\num\nthe findings were since called into\nquestion quite widely\num\none reason is just\nstatistics of cyclic events are\nsurprisingly complicated\nso so It's Tricky it's once you have a\ncyclic event statistics become tricky\nand and so\nMartha took a lot of heat on the\nstatistics of of claiming an effect\nand I think there was at least one\neffort\nof replication that didn't really work\nout\num if you ask me I'm on the fence\nso I I'm and but I'm maybe in a minority\nin my field I think a majority in the\nfield uh is currently negative I'm not\num and I've we've said in lab that we\nshould do a planned replication\num we will it's just\nagain it's a horrible study to run it's\ntons of work and you and and you have to\nrun it for a really long time\nuh and and uh so it's just completely\nnon-trivial\num but we have a graduate student now\nand lab interested in these exact things\nuh Road wisegross and she's doing\nsimilar stuff and and I hope we'll we'll\ndo that I hope we'll try to to replicate\nthis\num very interesting result and I think\nuh interesting because it of its Real\nWorld\num meaning outside the laboratory of\ncourse our experiment analog but also\nbecause\npheromone effects and olfactory effects\nin humans seem unique among uh\nneurobiological slash endocrine\nphenomena because there seems to be so\nmany stories that we all have of the\nsmell of our grandmother's hands or the\nrecognizing the scent of of somebody or\nI knew from the moment that\num I smelled their breath or you know or\nI just liked their smell kind of thing\nthese kind of things that that inform\nthe the Deep potential for a real\nbiological phenomenon as opposed to the\nkind of thing like oh uh you know you\njust throw something out there oxytocin\nis bonding and all of a sudden you know\nthe the general public not at no to no\nfault of their own comes to think that\nevery every aspect of bonding is is\noxytocin and every defect in bonding is\nlack of oxytocin but\nthe the general public provides a sort\nof a rich\num it's fodder for for exploring all\nthese things and a lot of times they\nturn out to be true right when in the\ncontext of old action yeah no it's it's\na very Primal system you know so so uh\nit's it's linked to the most\nyou know limbic Primal mechanisms in our\nbrain and it drives Primal Behavior it's\nan incredible system I I have a question\nabout\na particular study but I'm just going to\ncue it up and you'll know immediately\nwhat I'm I'm queuing up\num and that is what is the relationship\nbetween odors and hormones and in\nparticular\ncrying as I pointed out previously the\nthe sort of flavor of the month in in\nhuman social chemo signaling research is\nthe smell of fear and the the media of\nthe month is Sweat Right so so\num the the few maybe tens of labs in the\nworld that study uh Human Social chemo\nsignaling all collect sweat and and\nthat's the media uh they look at is it\nalways from the armpit org is there are\nthere meaningful differences in terms of\nthe sweat emitted from different\nlocations on the body I already know the\nanswer to that as I ask it but let's\njust stay above the waistline and um oh\nno no yes or below the waistline I mean\nwe're biologists after all we we just\nyeah so it's it's funny we we have we're\nworking on a paper on that right now on\nthe smell of fear uh so so we have a\nnice Paradigm for uh generating fear we\nthrow people out of airplanes it's a\nvery effective way to generate fear to\ncome to your lab it sounds like the\ngreatest lab in the world we didn't\ninvent that by the way uh the first to\ndo that was uh um and I hope I'm\npronouncing her name correctly I think\nit's mujika perudi\num but but um that's our Paradigm for\ngenerating fear and we started that on\nour own but uh We've since entered into\ncollaboration with the Israeli\nparatroopers Brigade and we now collect\nbody odor from every First Time Jumper\nso\num we we went that path because\nwe like everybody else in this field you\nknow the Holy Grail there is is finding\nthe molecules right I mean if you'll\nhave the fear molecules\nthat's a bonanza right because I mean\nyou know you could think of many reasons\nwhy it would be a bonanza but for for me\nyou know if you find the molecules you\ncan then try and find The receptors and\nwhen you find the cognitive receptors\nyou can then develop blockers and you\ncan imagine you know uh um uh um\nwhat's the term I'm looking for um\nI'm switching into Hebrew it's about\nmidnight now right I'm sorry you're\ndoing incredibly well considering two in\nthe morning yeah we would never know\num no one traveled in today from Israel\nso he's a circadian inverted as we say\nuh\num anxiety so so uh you can imagine\ndeveloping like a nasal spray against\nanxiety right where where you would\nquell those receptors and kill the fear\nresponse right which rather than going\nthe current path which is through\nneurotransmitters that then have effects\nall over the place you would be getting\nfear at its source right so so that\nwould be why I would want that and and\nwe figure out that doing that\nyou know collecting fear from like three\nfour or five people\num in an experiment you'll never be able\nto do analytical chemistry on that so we\nnow have uh we have uh a setting we call\nfear Bank uh which now has more than a\nthousand samples in it so we're trying\nto do uh uh analytics on that but\nin doing that we've we've joined you\nknow the the crowd everybody's doing\nfear and everybody's doing sweat and in\none of our discussions in the lab you\nknow we're saying well there's got to be\nyou know or there potentially definitely\ncould be additional bodily media\nthat are are playing into social chemo\nsignaling\nuh now many of these you know you can't\nreally study right I mean so you know\njust to throw what most terrestrial\nmammals communicate social information\nthrough urine\num but you know starting doing\nexperiments with humans with smelling\nurine it would be difficult you know\nboth in IRB and in agreement and\nyou know and and then we we you know\nthis is a rare case where we actually\nhypothesize what we set out to do and\nyou know and then only claim in\nretrospect that it was hypothesis\num is is tears\n[Music]\num\nwe we started thinking about tears and\nlooking into tears because tears are a\nbodily liquid emotional tears that that\nwe emit in emotional situations where\nwhere these are situations where\nnonverbal communication is is critical\nand key\nand and tears are a liquid that that\nis puzzling Beyond ocular maintenance\nright and so so you know the the most\ninfluential text I think till this day\nin in Emotion research is is Darwin's\nbook uh uh the showing of the emotions\nin men and animals I think is the full\nname of the book\nand an entire chapter chapter six is\ndevoted to tears\nan entire chapter of this book why with\nno conclusion why because the book\nrevolves around\ndescribing the functional antecedence of\nemotional Expressions so for example uh\nshowing of the teeth is a sign of\naggression right so so animals first bit\nwith their teeth and and Darwin argued\nthat through Evolution uh just uh\nshowing the teeth alone became an\naggressive sign because it started from\nbiting\nor what I I find is a beautiful example\nand this is work partly done by by Adam\nAnderson now at Cornell\num is is the uh emotional expression of\ndisgust\nso disgust which comes from Line This\ngoosia distaste right is spitting\nsomething out of your mouth now what\nwhat Adam showed is is that the\nmusculature patterns of activation and\nthe temporal sequence of activation\nwhen you experience moral disgust are\nthe same as when you spit a bitters\ntaste out of your mouth right so again\nso there's a functional antecedent\nspitting something out and through\nEvolution the argument was that it\nbecame an expression of emotion and you\nexpress disgust just as if you're\nspitting something out of your mouth\neven though they're you know in the case\nof moral disgust there's nothing you're\nspinning out of your mouth so so darn\nsystematically went through the\nexpressions of emotions and for each one\nwent to their functional antecedent and\nexplained everything very nicely and\nthen he got stuck with tears right\nbecause tears are an obviously emotional\nexpression and he could not find\na functional uh antecedent so he ended\nup saying this is an epic phenomenon\nbasically right I I don't know what all\nscientists do when they don't have a\ngood explanation you know blame it on\nnature right right so so\nand but he bothered to write this entire\nchapter on on the ocular or sort of\nMaintenance you know function of tears\nand so on so forth but but nothing\nemotional so we thought well maybe the\nfunction is is a chemical signal\nand\nand you know so so with that in mind we\nwe harvested emotional tears uh which\nwas also an amusing event on its own\nright because we we uh we uh\nwe we posted\num messages\non all sorts of boards that that uh\nwe're seeking\num\nexperiment participants who cry with\nease\nnow this generated an unfortunate gender\nbias in our study right because we\nreceived about 100 women volunteers and\nabout one man\nand you know I think this is not a\nproblem only in in Macho Israel right\nprobably anywhere in the west this would\nbe I mean definitely in America would be\nthe same I think my guess is that there\nare probably men out there who cry\neasily emotional tears because I'm sure\nthat they're just going to show up yeah\nthat's what I'm saying it's a cultural\nthing it's not you know you're not going\nto come to a lab and say yeah you know I\ncry all the time it's just not going to\nhappen\noh\nand then um we we what we did is uh for\neach one of these participants you know\nwe would ask them you know is there a\nparticular film event that you know of\nthat you know a scene that that makes\nyou cry and and interestingly in these\neffective choirs there's always oh yes\nyou know the scene in in so and so I\nalways cry profusely from that you know\nthey they have to give me an example of\none of the more commonly used scenes\nyeah with these\num\nthe movie The Champ\nthe champ dies he's a boxer and he dies\nand literally in the hands of his about\neight-year-old son\nand his son is standing next to his bed\nand you know saying chap Chap and and he\ndies right\nit's a winner okay\nwaterfall yeah yeah got it so you know\nwe're probably the neurobiology lab with\nmost sad movie films on those shelf in\nthe world right we have a whole huge\ncollection there is the same thing as\nTears of Joy by the way so no no well\nwe're going ahead of ourselves but they\nsay we tried to collect them and failed\num even people who think they shed tears\nof joy and laughter their eyes water a\nbit but it's not the same thing\nin in in the effective choirs we end up\nscreening so I can write we collect a\nfull mL of Tears a full mL of Tears in\nabout 15 minutes wow so so that's\npouring right and that doesn't happen\nfrom laughter that we or we've never\nseen that we've never seen that happen\nfrom a lot but we tried\num so so um\nso we have we have all these sad films\nand by the way one of the amusing things\nis uh when we ultimately published this\npaper in in science\num we were forced in retrospect to go\nout and actually buy the films right I\nmean you know originally we like\ndownloaded the rear there but you can't\nbecause you're you'd be violating uh uh\nyou know uh copyright laws right so we\nhad to buy like purchase all these films\nthat the parts and watch them so we we\nactually have these in lab like DVDs you\nknow that we actually purchased\num but so nice coverage of a potential\nlegal Fallout that I've known no we did\nyeah\nso uh and yeah and and well we can touch\non that later but up\nso um\nso most of these uh volunteers who who\ncome saying they can cry with ease\nactually don't meet the bill\num and so out of the about 100 at least\nmore women that we screened we ended up\nuh with about six\nwho who could really come to lab week\nafter week\nand and poor tiers there's a name for\nthis in Psychiatry they call it um a\nnarrative distancing some people when\nthey watch a film where someone's\ngetting hit they they they they Flinch\nquite a lot they it's almost as if\nthey're experiencing it it but it works\nin the opposite direction too I know\nsomeone like this um where if they watch\na film that someone's experiencing\nsomething even mildly positive that\ntheir mood elevates so they they can\nquickly Bridge yeah um and it's not\nalways adaptive as you can imagine so\nthere's a lack of narrative distancing\nright yeah what one you know issue you\ncan bring up with this entire line of\nstudies in our lab is is I don't know if\nthere's something very unique about the\ndonors right I mean we're assuming these\nare tiers and this is pretty common I\nthink that the numbers I saw out there\nabout five to eight percent that's\nexactly what we got about right\nso so we collected um\num tears\nand and we exposed uh participants uh to\nthese tiers\nand and we found a few things first of\nall the tears are completely odorless\nyou cannot detect them at all completely\nodorless\num\nAnd yet when you sniff them you have a\npronounced uh reduction in testosterone\nuh within about 20 minutes half an hour\nthis is men and women smelling in\nwomen's tears just men swelling women's\ntears but not perceiving any odor\nnothing just sniffing them\nand you have uh about uh 14 drop in free\ntestosterone free okay so this is\ntestosterone that's already been\nliberated from the testes free testers\nwe've done a few hormone that's uh\neither bound or Unbound is Unbound\nexcuse me\num from sex hormone and globulin Etc and\nit's the active form so it's it's uh\nit's subject to very short time scale\nchanges yeah and and this is you know\npeople who who study testosterone which\nis not me but they tell me this is a\nreally strong effect like it's it's hard\nto even pharmacologically get an effect\nlike that that fast I mean no in\nPharmacology yeah years ago I spent time\nstudying endocrine effects of this sort\num and that's a tremendous resized\neffect so and so here I'll point out in\npassing uh that uh one of the concerns\nwe had because of the uh\neffort to run this study is that nobody\nwould ever try to replicate it and to\nour Joy about two years later an\nindependent group from uh uh South Korea\nuh oh it Al who I don't know at all uh\nreplicated the testosterone effect to a\nt i mean like same numbers\nso so\num it it lowers testosterone and and\nwe then also looked uh using Mr at the\nat the uh\num effect\non brain activity and saw pronounced uh\nif effect on activity a dampening a\nlowering of activity uh under under uh\nan arousing State a lowering of activity\num both in the hypothalamus\num and in the fusiform gyrus for\nwhatever reason I don't know recognition\narea amongst other things yes\num and we don't know why\num but pronounced\num and currently\num Shania gron in our lab is replicating\nthis again and this time with a stronger\nbehavioral component\num and I can share with you uh\nunpublished uh data now under review\num that's as you would expect given the\neffect on testosterone perhaps uh\nsniffing tears lowers aggression in men\nuh using again the tap the same\nexperiment used by evine in the uh\nhexadecanal experiment that's happening\nI'm going to think of that as the the\nsay to the title The titration the\nsadist hydration yeah Tyler aggression\nParadigm so not unlike the Milgram\nexperiments of the of the 1950s which\npost\num this is looking at sort of uh post\nHolocaust Behavior you know people\nbasically in American Laboratories\nthinking they were torturing other\npeople yeah simply because they were\ntold to and a lot of people did that\neven though most people would report\nthat they would never torture someone\nyeah no humans are not a wonderful\nspecies\nI think it was the the great Carl Jung\nthat said um we have all things inside\nof us but um the goal is not to\nexperience them all certainly\num it's an incredible study and it\npoints again to the the power of of um\nthese chemo sensory systems and Pathways\nand uh obviously there's so much here\num I don't know if you want me to to\ntell about this or not and I guess you\ncan edit it out at least you don't but\nuh please this is just you know sharing\nstories about the politics of Science\nand and\nso whereas the effect on testosterone\nwas was uh replicated by by an\nindependent group\num\nin the original study in in science\nwhere we had we it had three components\none was the effect on testosterone which\nwas robust the second which was brain\nactivity which was robust\nand there was a significant but weaker\neffect on behavior and I don't think we\nstudied the right behavior in retrospect\nwhat we looked at then was uh readings\nof arousal associated with pictures\nand there was an effect it was\nsignificant but it was it was not what\ncarried the story\num now there's a lab in Holland\num of a guy by the name of\nI'm probably mispronouncing this but I\nthink it's vingerhots\nfor the non-dutch yeah Dutch names are\nalways a little bit of a challenge but\nand I shouldn't say that being an\nIsraeli I shouldn't go too much on that\nline but but uh that lab\nreally didn't like our original tear\nstory\nand the reason they didn't like it is\nbecause they've they've built a career\non this notion\num including a book with this title that\nemotional cheers are uniquely human\nnow\nhere I should well I should share so one\nof the things we really liked about that\nthe the uh tier result is that\npartially before we did our work but\nmore afterwards and and we like that\nbecause usually things so usually in our\nchemo signaling work like what I told\nyou before about the Bruce effect we\nlook at what happens in Ruins and we see\nif the same thing is happening in humans\nthis was a rare case where after we did\nthis work\num\nmore or less identical effects were\ndiscovered in rodents so uh a paper\npublished in nature two years later\nfound that Mouse tears uh Mouse pup\ntears lower aggression in in male adult\nmice towards them in a in a smell\ndependent way yeah yeah so and and they\nalso actually found the actual component\nin tears that so the tier pheromone that\nlowers aggression right so so you know\nthis has us thinking of regret as tears\nis as you can think of Tears as like a\nchemical blanket in a way that that\nyou're covering yourself up again with\nyou know to protect against aggression\nright and\nand so our finding you know which to me\nI mean this is consistent with how I\nthink about behavior in general you know\nI don't think you know beyond language\nthere are very few things definitely\nsensory things that are uniquely human\nyou know I I I'd be hard-pressed but so\nso you know our finding when it gets you\nknow against their their story right\nbecause you know here we're saying no\nyou know tears are this schema signaling\nmechanism like all animals and by the\nway I you know just after this entire\ndebate about uh um six months ago there\nwas a paper in current biology the dogs\nemit emotional tears and and it was uh\nthe dogs emit emotional Interiors when\nthey reunite with their owners and you\nwere talking before about about um\noxytocin so I think what they showed\nthere is that not only that but that the\nthe the view as seeing the tears and the\ndog influences oxytocin and in the\nhumans hope I'm getting this right now I\nabsolutely believe this I mean I from\nthe from the time I brought Costello\nhome at eight weeks old guys tell us\nyour dog is my dog unfortunately a long\ntime actually the only time I can recall\ncrying\nlisten I've certainly cried before many\ntimes in my life\num many many times\n[Music]\num\nthe only time I ever recall crying to\nthe point where I wasn't sure that I\ncould keep producing two years but\nsomehow it is when I had to put him down\nright it's just like you know and if I\ntalk about too long ago you know it's\none of those things yeah I think it's a\nhealthy yeah emotional state for sure\nbut I recall when he was a puppy\nthinking this oxytocin thing must be\nreal because\nI can recall being in faculty meetings\nwhich you know very fairly stated are\nnot always that interesting but they\ncould be pretty interesting and someone\npresenting data in my mind\nthinking I hope Costello's okay what's\nhe doing down in my office is when he\nwas very little and also not needing to\neat\nnot being able to focus on anything else\nexcept my attachment to him for about\nthe first two or three weeks that I had\nhim then it was easy then I could focus\noff on other things and I think I think\nthat dogs\nperhaps through oxytocin hijack the\ncircuitry that's intended for child rear\nyeah I really do otherwise why would\npeople be so ridiculously attached to\ntheir dogs I mean hence all the the\nposts of everyone thinks their dog is\nthe cutest dog the same way everyone\nthinks their children are the cutest\nchildren you know by the way\ntoo so so yeah so so again so they're so\neven you know to put another nail in\nthat story of of uh of tears are\nuniquely human so they're not dogs shed\nemotional tears\num and and and so that really didn't\nlike this and they went ahead and and\ntried to replicate and to your listeners\nI'm showing double uh quotations on the\nreplicate uh only the behavioral part\nthe ratings of arousal\num uh in women\nof women uh and and failed to replicate\nthat I see now this was you know just\nsharing on how science works and it\ndoesn't work in my in my notion in this\ncase\nso at the time\num\nafter they got this accepted in some\nJournal\n[Music]\num\nnot a field journal in the Journal of\nmemory of something\num\nthey contacted me for a response\nand I I wrote to the office and I said\nlook you know uh this is very odd to me\nwhy don't you come you know why don't we\nreplicate this again together and see if\nit doesn't work if it doesn't work I'll\npublish it with you that it doesn't work\nbut you know\num and so I said why don't you send over\na graduate student or the lead author\nand we'll do it here and we'll show them\nhow it's done because they they did it\nvery wrongly in the paper\num and so they replied that uh no they\ndon't have money to send over uh\ngraduation to do it so I replied saying\nokay I'll fund the graduate student\ncoming over and I'll fund the entire\nstudy in their stay and so on and so\nforth then let's do this together and\nthey replied no they're not willing to\nto do that\nwhich you know I don't think is the way\nthings should work\num and and they published this sort of\nfailed uh uh behavioral effect in in\nthat paper\num so I'm just sharing this you know\nthat it's not only there was that\nsuccessful replication with the effect\non testosterone but there was supposedly\nthis fail replication on the effect in\nin Behavior\num and then I published a rebuttal on on\nthat which I don't know if I should have\ndone but I did well I think it's it's\ninteresting I mean I I think um provided\nstudies are done correctly I mean the\npositive result\num almost always trumps the negative\nresult and yet I think replication is\nkey the problem as you point out is that\nreplication is rarely pure replication\nof these yeah this one's not even\nremotely but in I I published the detail\nso actually they hid something in their\ndata that did partially rip so I asked\nfor their data and I re-analyzed it and\nthat's what I published in the rebuttal\nbut you know this is just sharing on how\nscience works I I took advice so I'm\nit's not that that I'm friends with him\nbut at that time I was communicating a\nbit because we're on some board with\nwith uh with uh Daniel conman who's\nwho's Nobel looking fast and slow right\nand so so uh I asked him how how should\nI deal with this\nyou know give me some advice here I was\nreally you know it it was an emotionally\nnot fun to be in that position and he\nsaid don't don't\nnever publish a rebuttal don't do\nanything\nas you know how can I you know I have to\ndo something he said no don't because\nonce you do that then you know people\ndon't go into the details they won't\nread the details of your about all\nthey'll be like well there's a group\nthat says this and there's a group that\nsays that so it's unclear well and yeah\nI mean I I appreciate that you're\nbringing it up today and I I do\nappreciate that you published the\nrebuttal and that you offered in a very\nmagnificent way to do a collection\nthat's what he then said that's so so\nCommon's advice after that was that well\nif you insist then just publish Write a\nresponse that you offered them to to\ncome do it together they refused and\nthere's nothing you can do about that\nit's a lot like\num fight sports right people talk a lot\nof trash although in science you know I\nwill say this you know as long as we're\non the the sociology of science\nscience is very different than\npodcasting or social media or other\nfields because in science people\ngenerally are very kind to your face and\nthen they you get it in the you get it\nin the neck on Grant reviews or\nAnonymous reviews\num I was on a grants review panel this\nmorning I'm a nice reviewer meaning I\njudge things objectively but I I try to\nalways\num think from the perspective of the\ngraduate student or author of the of the\nproposal listen I I think that um\nscience is a is a game of of people who\nmost of them are seeking facts however\nthe the ego is strongly woven into it\nlike any like anything else so I think\nit was uh very magnanimous of you to\noffer the collaboration so I'm going to\ntell this lab whose name I can't\npronounce\num please accept the collaboration then\nwe can invite everyone on here for a\nround table\num I appreciate that you shared that\nstory and I know a number of other\npeople will\num for a number of reasons I have a\ncouple of more questions\num and I realize and thank you by the\nway for your uh for your willingness and\nstamina because it is probably 1am\nIsrael time now\num and you just arrived later I think um\nbut you're doing uh terrifically well so\nI I\num if you'll indulge us just a touch\nfurther there are two topics that\num I want to touch on and if you want to\ncover these in shorter Thrift that's\nfine although don't feel any obligation\nto\num the first one is\nI think most people are familiar with\nthe scent of food or Foods as a signal\nof the nutrient contents of those Foods\num you know an orange that smells great\nor the smell of something baking you\nknow it didn't it it suggests something\nabout the the contents and quality of\nthat food after all you and I both\nseparately lived in the same apartment\nin Berkeley above the cheeseboard which\nthe smell is wafting up through the\ncheeseboard is something I will never\nforget and the breads never forget it\num amazing uh I mean I don't know if\nyou've conveyed that clearly enough to\nlisteners or Watchers now the\nprobability really just discovered that\nwe lived in the same we've never met I\nmean like this before yep and we lived\nin the same room exactly where we click\nfriends\nin a lingering way I guess absolutely\nthrough the uh through the floorboards\nit had a great floor of that place it\nhad a great wooden floor it was an\namazing place I lived there with my\ngirlfriend for a year and a half and\nthen uh it was an amazing place\num we won't give it out the address for\nout of respect for the people that live\nthere now\num but do check out the cheese board if\nyou ever in Berkeley their hours are\nweird but so you have to look online but\nthat they're it's a unique Place yeah\nwith great bread and cheese and um some\ngood flavors of pizza\num in any case\num I'm wondering whether or not smell\ncan signal things about the nutrient\ncontents of foods in a way that's\ndivorced from the smell that we are\nperceiving so for instance I could\nimagine based on what you've told us\nabout smell today that\num you know I\nI don't know I I I smell a a piece of\nmeat cooking and it smells great to me\nand I think of it as oh that's so Savory\nand my mouth is watering and I love the\nsmell of this and I'm thinking okay this\nis protein and fat and I love the taste\nof steak and a little bit of char but\nthat nature has co-opted that\nto\nget ensure or I should say increase the\nlikelihood that I will ingest some other\nthing that's in stake for that has no\nodor but whose nutrient content is very\nimportant to me for instance amino acids\nright right I mean amino acids are\nessential to life and yet um we don't go\naround sniffing for amino acids we go\naround sniffing for savoriness Umami\ntype uh us tastes and things of that\nsort so um I could imagine a million\ndifferent examples of this in the same\nway I could imagine that the scent of\nsomebody that we fall in love with or\nbecome romantically attached to or you\nknow sexually attracted to is signaling\nall sorts of things about sure the\npotential for offspring of a particular\nimmune status that's a long term game\nbut also\num something about\num\npleasure and safety of a potential\ninteraction so what I'm asking here is\nabout that whether or not there are\nsubconscious signals that the um\nolfactory system has learned to seek but\nlearn to seek through more overt signals\nsort of the tip of the iceberg\nphenomenon so you know I don't have a\ngood answer for you although I think\nit's a really good question\num or or a good idea in fact so so\nwhether\nthe there's you know order cues on\nnutrient value\nis a really good idea moreover it's\nprobably good to the extent that\nsomebody probably did it and I should\nknow and don't\num we haven't done anything on that line\nso I don't know I don't know if if the\nnutrient value of food is systematically\nencoded in order\num if that's not been done and I will\ncheck after our uh meeting today then it\nshould be\num it's a really good idea I mean one of\nthe reasons I asked this is because um\nyou know the Obesity crisis in the U.S\nis a huge issue and elsewhere and highly\nprocessed foods\num you know I have a lot of things that\nare problematic but one of the things\nthat they don't have uh often is a\ndirect relationship between the scent\nThe Taste and the new and the nutrient\ncontent and I don't mean macronutrient\nsugar fat excuse me carbohydrates fats\nand proteins but the the vitamins and\nmicronutrients things that support the\nmicrobiome whereas foods that are not\nhighly processed\nfor instance meat or a piece of fruit\num contain many micronutrients that are\nvital to aspects of our biology but we\ndon't go around sniffing for probiotics\nI'll tell you one sort of factoid that\nmay support your hypothesis here\nand that is that\nthere appears to be potential olfactory\nperceptual similarity\nin metabolic products\nso something that's metabolized from\nsomething else\nhas perceptual similarity across those\nthose two things so so so metabolic\nCascades play into the coding of\nolfactory space\nand and that is consistent with the\ndirection your your implying but again I\ndon't I don't know of a direct test of\nof\nnutritional value in smell and and\nagain the fact that I don't know it\ndoesn't mean of course that it doesn't\nexist and in this case I would suspect\nthat it should exist\num in scientific press and and if not\nthere then with\nthe companies that have vested interest\nin this which are many\num uh briefly sure just just an amusing\nanecdote to share with you is that we've\nreceived\ntoo independent\num\num\npeople you know companies who have\nturned to our lab recently uh asking for\nhelp uh to to bring odor to engineered\nmeat right that's a growing thing and\nall these you know meats that are\nannoying you had to bring it up this\nthis audience is going to be very\npolarized along the along the lines of\nengineered meat um you're not you're not\nfrom you're not promoting oh no no no no\nno no I am I'm agnostic but but uh but\nwe've had two companies turn to us and\nsay look you know we have this great\nproduct but it just doesn't smell like\nmeat so help us make it smell like meat\ninteresting uh the reason it's so\npolarizing is that anything related to\nnutrition on social media is a total\nbarbed wire topic we've had experts on\nnutrition come on here we'll have more\nbut I I have nothing you're safe no\ndon't worry no it's not and it's not\npromoting uh this he hasn't even said\nwhether or not he's going to help them\nout no um we're not actually no no\nbecause yeah I just never it didn't\nhappen no yeah no the the whether or not\nthose um engineered meats are uh yum\nyuck or met is is a personal issue to\npeople in terms of taste whether or not\nthey are better for neutral or worse for\nyou and the planet than given the\ningredients that are required that's a\nwhole world we'll avoid now I will but\nyou know I'll take that the opportunity\nto to highlight something related maybe\nbecause I'm on what were you saying on\nthe\non the scale\nyou know there's this\nyou know I'll take the opportunity to\ndispel another misconception about\nolfaction\nright there's this common notion that\nour sense of smell\num is incredibly subjective\nright and that what you might like in a\nsmell I will not liken the smell and\nthat we all have our own you know\ntotally subjective world of all faction\nI think I know the study you're going to\ntell me there are many the\ncross-cultural similarities there are\nmany that that is utterly untrue many\nnot only from my lab there are many from\nmany Labs uh please clarify for those\nthat don't follow this list so\num yeah so so\nhumans\nare incredibly similar to one another\nand they're olfactory perception and\nthis is in contrast to what most people\nthink so why why is there this\nmisconception\nthe misconception is there for two\nreasons first of all or for several\nreasons but two are stand out\nfirst of all we're attracted by outliers\nbecause you know what I'll tell somebody\nlook you know for example a factory\npleasantness is highly correlated\namongst humans and let's first put this\nin numbers you'll take a a bunch of\nhumans and a bunch of odorants and have\nthem write pleasantness the correlation\nacross uh the humans will be about 0.8\nthat's incredibly High incredibly High\nwhat do you think is Pleasant I think is\nyeah yeah now why why is that go against\nwhat culturally people think\nfor two reasons first of all\nwhere we're attracted or biased by\noutliers but that's particularly that\nshows in fact the results what do I mean\nso you'll tell somebody look people are\nvery similar in their pleasantness\nestimates and that's all you know that\ncan't be I love cilantro and you know my\ngirlfriend hates the smell of cilantro\nright or and there are a few classic\nexamples there right you know is another\nuh uh polarizing order so there are a\nfew polarizing orders right and and\nthat's true right so that's true that\nyou know half of the population loves\nthe smell of cilantro and half hates it\nhalf loves guiava half hates it that's\nmicrowave popcorn\nhowever\nI assure you that you know you can come\nto our lab we have about a thousand\nodorants in our lab okay we won't smell\nthe Thousand right but I assure you you\nknow take a hundred odorants okay from\nour mixtures and Labs right and we'll\nwe'll smell them right and\nout of the hundred orders\n90 will totally agree on right and\nincluding Universe I mean you know\nnobody will say they like the smell of\nfeces or fecal smells and everybody will\nsay they like the smell of rose and\nFlowery smells there will be rare rare\nexceptions again the correlation is\nabout 0.8 across individuals\nso on 90 of 100 will really be in high\nagreement then five orderings will be in\nsort of intermediate agreements and yes\nthey'll be the five orderings that were\nin total disagreement on but I asked you\nyou know if we agree on 95 and disagree\non five are we the same or are we\ndifferent we're the same they're just\noutliers to this to this Rule and and\nand so one reason is this issue of of\noutliers attract how we think about\nthings but no we're actually much more\nsimilar than than what we think\nand the second thing that that drives\nthis cultural effect is the LA is our\npoor application of language to\nolfaction right so so in other sensory\nsystems we grow up with we're we're we\ndevelop with anchors right so since\nyou're a little kid you know your mother\nshows you a cow and says what does a cow\ndo moo right and we all know moo moo and\nwhat color is this it's well this is\nkind of an odd black but it's black\nright or what color is that it's red\nright so you have these anchors but as\nyou all know you know the red that I'm\nseeing is not necessarily the red that\nyou're seeing we just both know to call\nthat red and since you say red and I say\nred I think why we're seeing the same\nthing but no we're not seeing the same\nthing right and in odor we don't have\nthose anchors right we we don't from\nchildhood you know our mom doesn't tell\nus so what's this smell and what's that\nsmell right and so we don't have these\nlanguage anchors that make us think that\nwe're perceiving the same thing now how\ncan you quantify that\nthe most important term in in measuring\nsensory systems is similarity right\nthat's the measure right so what can you\nlet's say we take 10 odorants and I have\nyou rate all the pairwise similarities\nright so you'd end up with 45 numbers\nright so you know how similar is one to\ntwo one to three and one to four and\nthen two and all the possible pairwise\nsimilarities let's say you rate\nsimilarity from one which is totally\ndissimilar to 100 exactly the same right\nso now I have a similarity Matrix\nthat describes Andrew's perception of\nsmell right I have you know based on\nthese 10 odorants that I selected now I\ncan run my similarity Matrix and then I\ncan see if the similarity Matrix are\ncorrelated right and then we've gotten\nrid of the issue of names and orders\nright it doesn't matter if I'll call\nthis lemon in this orange and you call\nthis sweet potato in this marshmallow\nright it doesn't matter if I think that\nthese two are highly similar and you\nagree and I think that these two are\nvery different and you agree right we\nperceive the world in the same way if\nour similarity matrices are aligned\nright and what's nice about that is that\nthen you can do that for vision audition\nand off action in a common group and you\ncan see where we're more alike each\nother or not and we've done that for\ncolor vision all faction internal\naudition okay and we are most dissimilar\nin color vision\nokay where in color vision the variance\nis about 100 amazing it's quite\ndifferent and there's tons of literature\non this tons of it tons of it right and\nin all faction and audition they're\nabout the same\nso we're not different we're very\nsimilar we're just very poor at\nappreciating this\nand and mind you not that there's not\nvariability there is variability and of\ncourse the system is malleable as all\nsensory systems are so you can learn to\nlike an order and and that will change\nyou and learn to dislike in order right\nbut just the way you can learn to like a\nsound or dislike a sound so you know\nthis doesn't take away from the\nhardwired link of a structure to its\nperception that you can that they're\nmalleable and and and we're we're not\nvery variable we're we're actually kind\nof similar\nthat's a perfect segue to the question I\nhave next which is if\nin general people perceive certain odors\nsimilarly\nyou could imagine that odors could be\num manufactured co-opted uh Etc in order\nto elicit richer sensory experiences and\ndrive Choice making\num that's obvious at the level of the\nsmell of a hot dog stand or freshly\nbaked bread Etc but what I'm talking\nabout here and I'd like to ask you about\nis doing this at scale and scientists\nGeeks like to say in silico in uh\nthrough computers so for a long time now\nthere's been this idea that there will\nsoon be Google smell not to call out\nGoogle is the only search engine but\nDuck Duck Go smell for those of you that\ndon't want to hear smell chat chat and\non and on in other words\nyou know Vision visual key information\nis sent through uh computer interfaces\nas is auditory information not so much\nhaptic somatosensory although it can you\nknow we our lab uses VR it's it it can\nbe done right um but it hasn't really\ntaken hold\num however smell being such a rich\nsource of\nbehavioral and hormonal and other sorts\nof deep deep information that can drive\npeople in to Yum yuck or meh type\ndecision making yeah uh seems like an\namazing candidate so what is your\nexperience with\num generating smells in silico in\ncomputers and here folks for those of\nyou that aren't catching on to this and\nand I don't expect that everyone would\nbecause what we're really alluding to\nhere\num is the idea that you'll look at\nyou'll put into a search engine\num uh blueberry pancakes recipe\nand that not only will you get photos of\nthose blueberry pancakes and a recipe\nbut you will get the hopefully validated\nodor of those pancakes and that recipe\ncoming at you in real time through the\ncomputer\nso I'll start off answering from uh from\nthe uh the name you threw out there\nGoogle\nso about probably about five years ago\nuh\nGoogle had an April Fool's spoof oh\nright and they put out this video\nof Google smell okay and and it had all\nthese like classic like sales images of\nyou know holding up your phone to a rose\nand it generating rows and and and all\nthese things right\nso Google is now trying to do that\num and they just they just uh uh\npublished I mean I I know they've been\ntrying to do it for a while they visited\nour lab uh but they just sort of went\npublic with this that really just like\nabout a month ago or something that that\num they have this offshoot startup\num I think it's called osmo or something\nlike that that\nstarted off with a ridiculous sum of\nmoney for a startup like yeah I don't\nknow tons of money a lot there's a lot\nof money in that world yeah yeah in\nGoogle yeah\num\nto to um you know to digitize uh smell\nand and um\nand there are other companies that are\ntrying to do this as well\num and we've been talking now for quite\na while about our our Labs chemo\nsignaling work but actually half of our\nlab is devoted to this question of of uh\nultimately digitizing smell\num\nand and so so this is a very very active\nfield of research and and and I'll say\num\none thing that that dovetails with what\nyou were talking about before\num in many ways\ncovid is going to be one of the best\nthings that ever happened to all faction\nresearch\nbecause suddenly all the world\num is all the world lots of people are\nare um very cognizant of the importance\nof smell and smells like way up there in\npeople's awareness because of covet and\nthis is driving a Renaissance of of\nolfaction research and\nin Awareness to all faction is something\nthat's worth paying attention to uh\nand and our lab has been involved in\nthis way in this effort for a long time\nwhere where the initial part of this\neffort\nis in fact to develop a set of rules\nthat link order structure to odor\nperception\nthat is\nthe going thing was that that until\nrecently at least there was no scientist\nor perfumer for that matter who could\nlook at the structure of a novel\nmolecular mixture and predict for you\nhow it will smell\nor smell something and tell you what\nmolecular structure could or should be\nyou know so in contrast let's say the\ntrivial like color vision let's say so\nyou know if you know what the wavelength\nof the light is you more or less know\nwhat perceived color it's going to be of\ncourse there are exceptions to that and\nand all sorts of issues but as a rule\nyou you would know or you know or the\nother way around you know you can\ngenerate a wavelength and you would know\nwhat color light uh it's going to be\nperceived\num so so that's an example of where the\nrules linking structure in this case\nmeasured by wavelength and perception in\nthis case experience this color the\nrules are well known in olfaction we\ndidn't have that until recently\num but over the past two years a bunch\nof labs have really\num uh pushed this forward uh there's a\nbunch of work out of Leslie vosh Hall's\nLab at Rockefeller and Andreas Keller\nworking with Leslie\num uh who've done a lot of work on this\nfront\num also work from Joel mainland's Lab at\nmonell\num and fair Discovery Joel was a\ngraduate student in our lab\num and and recently in our lab we've had\nit and I hope this doesn't come across\nas overly arrogant but we we've had a\nsort of mini breakthrough on this front\nto call something a mini breakthrough is\nfar from arrogant and and this is a\npaper uh led by Aaron ravia uh uh from\nour lab and Kobe snitz also a major\ncontributor there a paper published in\nnature uh about a year and a half ago in\nthe height of a coveted pandemic so\nnobody really or I won't say nobody but\nit wasn't noticed in the way it would\notherwise would have been it was it was\npublished in nature really on like a\nweek where the whole world was like\ngoing berserk over covid\num\nand in this paper we develop an\nalgorithmic framework uh where we can\npredict the perceptual similarity\nof any two molecular mixtures with very\nvery high accuracy\nso if you give me two molecular mixtures\nI can predict how similar you you will\nsmell them to be okay now not only could\nwe predict that but we could design it\nso we can generate\num um\nmixtures with known similarities\nand the the result was highlighted and\nyou'll appreciate this coming from\nvision is that using our algorithmic\nsolution we generated olfactory\nmetameres so we measured mixtures\ncompletely non-overlapping in their\nmolecular structure but they smell\nexactly the same\nokay now if you would come to a classic\nperfumer or most classic perfumers and\ntell them that you can generate two\nmixtures with zero molecules in common\nbut smell exactly the same\nthey would tell you no and yet we did\nand anybody can recreate them this is\nsimple actually\num\nin in the paper we do a few things like\nwe generate amid a mirror for uh Chanel\nNumber Five so you don't like perfume so\nthis one but but we we take so we\ngenerate a Chanel Number Five with no\ncomponent from Chanel number five in it\nokay\num and we actually have a publicly\navailable website I'll give it to you\nfor your links if you want that anybody\ncan do this we built an engine that you\ncan generate these these metameras now\nonce we did that\nin a way we've generated the the the\ninfrastructure for digitizing smell\nbecause\nwhat again what we what are what our\nalgorithm predicts our framework\npredicts is similarity but in a way\nthat's enough for you why is that enough\nwe have a map\nof 4 000 molecules uh for each one we\nknow there are perceived smell\nnow you can make up any mixture you want\nfrom me I can project it into that map\nand measure its pairwise distance from\nall the points in the map if it falls on\nLemon then what you generated smells\nlike lemon and if it falls you know on\ntomato then what you generated smells\nlike tomato\nso we we now solve that problem we can\npredict the order of any molecular\nmixture we can see how it's going to\nsmell\nwhat we can do is then find a set of\ncomponents which we call outer primaries\nthat can be used to mix any odor that\nyou can perceive\nand that's what we're working on now\num and in about a month ago so this is\nin collaboration with a lab of Jonathan\nWilliams and Max Planck in Munich\nJonathan Williams is an uh atmospheric\nchemist\nuh but he's really good at at using gcms\nthese tools that measure molecules so\nJonathan Williams measured odorants in\nGermany uh transmitted the information\nto us over IP\nuh we fed that into our algorithmic\nframework and recreated it from a device\nthat mixes primaries\nuh and we tried to do four different\nodorants uh in our our proof of concept\ntest uh one of them uh was Rose and we\nfailed at recreating rows we in fact\nrecreated something that had a preset\nbut most people perceived it as bubble\ngum\nuh the second one we tried to do was a\nnice and we failed at recreating Anis\nand most people said it was Cherry which\nis not very far but it failed\nthe third was gasoline\num and we were slightly but\nsignificantly better than chance at\nrecreating Gasoline\num and the fourth was was violets and 15\nof 16 peoples and violets so the first\norder ever transmitted over IP is\nviolets and we did that last month\num of course\nthis is not anything near a practical\nsolution uh the device uh uh that\nJonathan was using to measure uh is uh\n1.5 million dollar device bigger than\nthis table uh that's right I remember\nwhen VCRs half the audience won't even\nknow what that is yours were like this\nbig so we're we're all good okay I'm all\ngood with the uh with the prediction\nthat things will come down in size and\ncost yeah I'm just saying here you know\ndon't hold your breath for this to be on\nyour table tomorrow\num and and you know again even even you\nknow all we have in hand is this very\ninitial proof of concept you know it\ndoesn't it's not even yet close to being\na paper we are submitting because\nthere's still lots of work to be done uh\nbut we're on we're on the path uh we're\non the path and you know Google will\nprobably beat us to it uh they got a lot\nno you seem pretty dogged in there yeah\nbut they have so much more resources\nthat uh that um at this stage it and\nthey've already published uh two papers\nfrom that effort that are good uh yeah\nyou know they definitely have a lot of\ndollars and a lot of people a lot of\ngood uh neuroscience and other biology\nEngineering Graduate students and\npostdocs go there but but um the real\nquestion is are they getting the best\npeople because as you and I both know in\nscience the oftentimes it's small groups\nof of the very best and most creative\npeople that can uh out run and outgun\nlarge groups and and here I don't have\nanything against Google either way yeah\num I I use it all the time I'm not a\nbetting man but I would put my my money\non Google on this race but I'll give\nI'll try and give them a a run for their\nmoney there you go that was well since I\nmostly just want to see the problem\nsolved regardless of who gets there\nfirst what I'll say is you better get\ngoing Google because gnomes being he's\nhumble and he's dogged so I don't know\num better better get cracking there we\njust cost the weekends of and uh and\nbroke up the relationships of a bunch of\nscientists I remember when I was a\ngraduate student at Berkeley I remember\nhearing there was a guy in in our common\nfriend uh or uh Irving zucker's lab that\nworked hundred hours a week so I was\nlike oh I'll work 102 hours a week which\nwas not a good choice but in any case\nit's it's uh it's abundantly clear that\nyou're making progress here and and I go\nto some of the earlier discussions we\nhad and I think we're not just talking\nabout transferring recipes and smells of\nfood uh gasoline from people watching\nthe the F1 race or something but um I'm\nthinking dating apps I'm thinking um you\nnowadays everyone knows that when you\ntravel and you want to see your family\nyour grandkids or kids you better to get\non FaceTime and see them resume\num than to just hear their voice we're\nalso talking about being able to smell\nthem I'll tell you more than that I'll\ntell you more than that I mean we're\ntalking now of trying to achieve uh the\nolfactory equivalent of Circa 1956 black\nand white TV okay basically right and\nyou know I'm not dreaming let's say of\nbeing able to transmit to you the\ndifference between a Cabernet or\nAmarillo right but if I can generate\nsomething that's legally wine that will\nbe an amazing success from my\nperspective right but Jump Ahead in your\nimagination to to 4K order transmission\nthan medical Diagnostics is what you\nwant to be talking about because\nin this is this is uh uh over uh\nextension but\nyou can almost say that every disease\nwill have an odor I mean every disease\nis a specific metabolic process\nmetabolic process have metabolites\nmetabolites have a smell\nolfaction once it's digitized and and\nhigh resolution which again in our hands\nit's not going to be I mean we're\ntalking you know in my retirement maybe\nI'll read about this one day if I'll\nstill have Vision I mean this is not\nclose but\nwhen when olfaction digitization is\nbrought to the equivalent of 4K uh of\nvision and audition that you have now\nthen it will be in medical diagnosis\nyou'll have excuse me for the uh the\nimagery but you will have an electronic\nnose in your bathroom uh each one of us\nwill have in the toilet and it will be\ndoing Diagnostics all the time and and\nthat's that's where it's going to go but\nagain not anywhere in the very close\nfuture\nwell it's it's certainly an exciting\nproposition and I'm delighted that you\nand other groups um who are so strong\nare working on it I really am\nno my I want to say thank you for your\ntime today first of all uh this was a\ntremendously interesting conversation I\nmean we touched on so many things\nhormone smells the architecture of the\nolfactory system I know that people\nlistening to this are realizing but I'm\ngoing to say it anyway uh what an\nIncredible Gift you've given us in um as\na\nexpert in this field giving us this tour\nof of the work that you and others uh\nwho you credit so generously\num have done to elucidate this\nincredible system that we call olfaction\nchemo sensation\nalso just for the incredibly pioneering\nwork that you've done you know I\nI don't have many heroes in science I\nhave Heroes outside of Science and a few\ninsights but I'm gonna um I'm gonna uh\npurposely embarrass myself a little bit\nby saying that from the time I was at\nBerkeley and I then and saw that\nexperiment being done and people\nforaging uh falling Ascent trails and\nthen when I was a until I was a junior\nProfessor I used that in my teaching\nslides\num in a class that I taught that was\nsort of the early origins of this\npodcast in many way and over and over\nagain when your laboratory publishes\npapers I find like this is super\ninteresting super cool and I find myself\ntelling everybody about it and that's\nreally what I do for uh for a living is\nI I learn and then I blab about it to to\nthe world so thank you so much for the\nwork that you've done in the spirit that\nyou bring to it whatever drives that\nSpirit as the great late Ben Barris used\nto say keep going because we are all\nbenefiting tremendously and\num and I also just want to say that you\nknow for people listening to this the\nthe spirit of science is one of as you\nmentioned there's complex politics and\nall these things but it's absolutely\nclear that you Delight in the work you\ndo and um so I Delight in it I'm\ngrateful for it I'm grateful for your\ntime today and so on behalf of me and\nand many many people listening to this I\njust want to say send a huge debt of\ngratitude thank you so much\nso I'm I'm the I'm blushing I don't know\nif this doesn't come across on the on\nthe radio Podcast but thank you so much\nfor very warm words I mean you know as\nyou know it when you work in your lab\nyou don't\nthere's these moments where you suddenly\ndiscover that somebody is like\ncares a bit about it and those are\nalways very rewarding moments because\nusually you you function without that I\nmean I guess that's one of the things\nyou need\nto be a scientist is to have the\nyou know the drive to work without that\nbecause it comes only rarely uh there's\nimmense gratitude and appreciation for\nyou and what you do from me and now I\nknow from uh a large segment of the\nworld as well so uh my only request is\nthat you come back and tell us about the\nnext results sometime not too long now\nyeah well I'm going to catch you live\nnow although you have the power to edit\nthis so I guess that's not fair but\nfirst you come visit us in Israel and\nand tell us both about the science and\nthe public science work you're doing and\nthen I'll come again\na good bargain and again I accept\ndelighted thank you so much yeah\npleasure thank you for joining me for\ntoday's discussion about olfaction and\nchemo sensation with Dr Noam Sobel if\nyou'd like to learn more about the work\nin the Sobel laboratory or read some of\nthe
