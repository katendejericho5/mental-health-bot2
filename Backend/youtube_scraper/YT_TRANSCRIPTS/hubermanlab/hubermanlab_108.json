you that\nare not Huberman Lab podcast\npremium subscribers,\nyou can still\nhear the first 20 minutes\nof today's episode\nand determine whether or not\nbecoming a premium subscriber\nis for you.\nAnd now without further ado,\nI will answer your questions.\nAnd as always, I\nwill strive to be\nas thorough as possible,\nas clear as possible,\nand as concise as possible.\nThe first question\nis about eye health,\nin particular eye\nhealth protocols\nfor people that are aging\nbut eye health protocols\nfor people in general.\nThe question is, I'm\nnoticing that my vision,\nboth close and far,\nis deteriorating.\nWhat are the best eye\nexercises, eye health behaviors,\nsupplements, et cetera\nfor the aging eye?\nSo the answer I'm\nabout to provide\napplies to everybody\nregardless of age,\nwhich is, you want to make sure\nthat you view things both close\nup and far away across your day.\nMany, many people nowadays\nspend a lot of time\nlooking at their smartphone,\nlooking at the computer screen,\nlooking at books and\npaper, in other words,\nlooking at things somewhere\nbetween 9 inches away\nfrom their face and their\neyes, maybe 2 and 1/2 feet away\nfrom their face and eyes.\nThis is an unprecedented\nevent in human history,\nas far as we know,\nbecause it wasn't\nuntil the advent\nof the smartphone\nthat we've spent so much\ntime looking at screens\nat close range\nrelative to looking\nat things at further\ndistances from our face\nthroughout the day.\nIn fact, it should\ncome as no surprise\nthat the incidence of\nmyopia, of nearsightedness,\nis increasing dramatically\naround the world\nbut is increasing\nparticularly fast in children\nand in young adults\nand even in adults\nwho are viewing things at very\nclose range, so 2 and 1/2 feet\nor less.\nNow, I am not saying\nthat viewing things\nat 2 and 1/2 feet or less is bad\nfor your eyes, that is simply\nnot the case.\nHowever, if you want your\nvision to be maintained or even\nimprove, it's going\nto be very important\nfor you to view\nthings at a distance\nas well for ideally\nseveral hours per day.\nNow, I realize some people just\nsimply won't accomplish this.\nIn fact, I'd like everyone\nto just take a moment\nand do a rough\nestimation in your head\nof how much time during\nyour daytime activities\nyou are viewing things at,\nsay, 2 and 1/2 feet or 3\nfeet or less, so\nsmartphone, computer screen,\npaper, books, et cetera,\nversus viewing things\nthat are 4 feet\naway, 8 feet away,\nso maybe conversation across the\ntable with another human being.\nRemember those?\nSome of us are\ndoing that more now\nthat we seem to be emerging\nfrom this whole pandemic phase.\nHowever, many people are\nstill mostly just viewing\nthings within very close range.\nAnd, in fact, if you were to\nask yourself, how much time do\nyou spend looking at things at\nthe distance of many hundreds\nof feet, or taking a walk\nwhere you're not looking\nat any screen and\nyou're simply letting\nvisual images or\nthe visual imagery\nrather pass by on your\neyes, I think for most of us\nthat number is getting\nprogressively smaller\nand smaller with\neach passing year.\nSo this is an issue because\nthe structure of the eye\nis such that the lens\nof the eye can move,\nbut also that the length of\nthe eyeball from front to back\nis actually impacted\nby how close\nor how far you\nhappen to view things\nduring the course of your day,\nespecially during development.\nThere's a classic\nexperiment that I'd\nlike to just briefly\ndescribe to you which\nhas been performed in chickens.\nIt's been performed in mice.\nIt's also been\nperformed on humans,\nwhere a visual occluder\nor a visual image.\nSo an occluder is just a black\nscreen or a piece of cardboard\nor an image, maybe some black\nand white checks or checkers,\nare placed at a certain\ndistance from the eye,\neither up close or far\naway, and the impact\nof that on the\nlength of the eyeball\nand on the structure of the lens\nand on the quality and acuity\nof vision is then measured.\nAnd to make a long story short,\nwhat these studies show is\nthat, if during development,\nyou or an animal\nexclusively looks at things\nthat are up close, very\nclose to the eye, and doesn't\never get long-range vision,\nthe eyeball lengthens.\nAnd when that happens the\nlens, which, of course, is\nin the front of\nthe eyeball, which\nfocuses the light onto\nthe back of the eyeball,\nwhich is where the\nso-called neural retina\nis, where the cells\nthat sense light are,\nthat visual image\nlands in front of as\nopposed to directly on\nthe light-sensing portion\nof the eyeball that we\ncall the neural retina.\nIt lands too close or near\nthe lens as opposed to\non the back of the eyeball.\nAnd that's part\nof the reason what\nwe call the consequence of\nthat nearsighted myopia.\nIn far sightedness,\nthe opposite happens.\nThe visual image is actually\nfocused behind the retina.\nIt doesn't land directly on the\nretina, which is what you want.\nIt's focused too far\nbehind the retina.\nAnd that's due to a\nshortening of the eyeball.\nSo what I just\ndescribed actually\nexplains pretty well why kids\nwho look at computer screens,\nor books up close\noften need glasses.\nWhen I was growing up, they\ncalled this nerd syndrome.\nRaising my hand for those\nof you that are listening.\nI read an awful lot, but I also\nspend time outside fortunately\nand running around\non the soccer field\nand looking at things\nin the distance\nand playing in the\nneighborhood with my friends.\nKids that spend the vast\namount of their time looking\nat things up close,\nand particularly\nchildren who do that indoors\nfor most of their waking time,\nwell, those kids develop myopia.\nThis is part of\nthe reason why we\nhave such an increase of the\nincidence of myopia nowadays.\nWhat's interesting, and I think\nmost people don't realize,\nis that even as a young adult\nand adult, and perhaps even as\nan older adult,\nan elderly person,\nlooking at things up close to\nmuch at the expense of getting\nsome time viewing\nthings at a distance,\nin particular outdoors, can\nbe very problematic because it\ncan exacerbate myopia.\nSo the short,\ndirect prescription\nhere is to make sure that you're\ngetting at least an hour or so\neach day, although ideally it\nwould be more, of long viewing.\nAnd that could be done by\nwalking outside and avoiding\nlooking at your\nphone while walking.\nIt doesn't require that you\nlook at a particular object\nin the distance, although if\nyou are scanning for and looking\nfor objects in the distance,\nthe way that you might on a hike\nor you're looking out\ntoward or off a vista\nor you're looking for\nsomeone in the distance,\nall of that sort of\nvisual scanning behavior\nis going to be very\ngood for your eye health\nand for maintaining\nvision at a distance.\nIf you're somebody\nwho's far sighted\nand you have trouble\nseeing things up close,\nwell, then you need to ask\nyourself whether or not\nyou're spending too much\ntime looking at things off\nin the distance, although\nI want to be very\nclear that nearsightedness\nand farsightedness aren't\nnecessarily the consequence\nof this near, far viewing.\nThere can be independent\ncauses of nearsightedness\nand farsightedness.\nBut for many people\nout there who\nare spending progressively\nmore and more time just looking\nat things up close, you\ncan get this lengthening\nof the eyeball or\nchallenges in the way\nthat the elasticity of\nthe lens is controlled\nby the musculature\nin ways that make\nit hard to maintain sharp,\ncrisp vision when you're\nlooking at things at a\ndistance or up close.\nSo I can't, because there\nare simply no studies\nto support the idea that you\nneed exactly two hours per day\nof outside long vision at a\nparticular distance and/or\nthat you want to cut off\nor have a threshold of four\nhours per day of looking\nat things up close,\nbut we can say with a\nhigh degree of confidence\nthat if you want to\nmaintain or enhance\nyour vision at all distances,\nthat for every hour or so\nthat you spend\nlooking at things,\nsay, a distance of\n3 feet away or less,\nthat you want to get at least\none hour per day total, doesn't\nhave to be all at once,\nof looking at things\nout in the distance\nor looking at things beyond 3\nfeet relative to the distance\nfrom your eye.\nSo I think for some people\nwho are already badly myopic,\nthis isn't going to\nremedy that myopia.\nYou're still going to\nneed corrective lenses,\nbut if you're somebody,\nsimilar to the person who\nasks the question, that they're\nquote unquote \"noticing\"\ntheir vision is\ndeteriorating, really\ntry and balance out\nthe amount of viewing\nthat you're doing at close\ndistance and long distance.\nAnd, again, I would not obsess\nabout the total numbers.\nIt doesn't have to be three\nhours and three hours,\nbut the more time that you\ncan spend at viewing things\nthat variable distance\nthroughout the day,\nthe better off you're going to\nbe in maintaining and perhaps\neven enhancing your\nvision somewhat.\nNow, there's an\nadditional behavioral tool\nthat we can glean from the\nrecent scientific literature\nexploring myopia which\npoints to the fact\nthat children who get\ntwo hours a day or more\nof time outside in sunlight--\none of my favorite topics.\nI know many people are\nprobably rolling their eyes\nright now when they\nhear me say you really\nwant to view morning\nsunlight, not\nthrough a window or windshield.\nDon't wear sunglasses for that,\ntrying to get as much sunlight\nas you can in your\neyes early in the day.\nNever stare at any light\nso bright it's painful,\nlook at, et cetera.\nWe've done a lot of\nepisodes on this.\nWe have a Light\nfor Health episode,\nthis Isn't All the\nSleep episodes.\nIt's just such a\nbasic foundation\nof circadian rhythm and health\nthat I just keep repeating it.\nHowever, there are also\nlarge-scale clinical trials\ninvolving thousands\nof subjects that\nhave shown that people,\nchildren in particular, who\nget two hours or more of\noutside time every day\nhave a much lower\nincidence of myopia.\nNow, what's really interesting\nabout these studies is that,\nwhile some of those kids are\nlooking at things further\noff in the distance than they\nwould if they were indoors\non their tablets or screens\nor with their nose in a book,\nit does not seem to\nbe the case that they\nhave to be looking at\nthings in the distance\nin order to see this\nreduced incidence of myopia.\nWhat's probably\nhappening instead\nis that the\nparticular wavelengths\nof light that\nemanate from the sun,\nthat photon energy in\nparticular is triggering\nthe activation of the\nso-called intrinsically\nsensitive melanopsin and retinal\nganglion cells, which we know\nare important for setting\ncircadian rhythm for enhancing\nmood focus and\nalertness during the day\nand enhancing the quality and\nduration of sleep at night.\nBut those melanopsin and\nintrinsically photosensitive\nganglion cells are also\ninvolved in networks\nwithin the eye that\nrelate to blood flow, that\nrelate to the\nciliary body, which\nis a structure within the eye\nthat controls the aperture\nand movement of\nsome key components\nwithin the eye, that also relate\nto the crispness of vision,\nthat is the acuity of vision,\nat both short and long range.\nSo there are a lot of\ntechnical details there.\nIn fact, I really hope to\nget the great Russell Van\nGelder, or Dr.\nRussell Van Gelder,\nwho's the chair of ophthalmology\nat the University of Washington\nin Seattle, who is a\nworld expert in this\nand the various aspects,\nboth molecular and structural\nof the ciliary\nbody and the lens,\nand he's an expert in uveitis,\na very interesting topic\nin its own, to come\nonto the podcast\nand talk more about eye health.\nAnd we will do that in the\nnot too distant future.\nMeanwhile, if the first\nbehavioral protocol\nfor enhancing and\nmaintaining eye health\nis to make sure that you're\nspending at least some time\nbalancing out the near vision\nand far vision during the day,\nit also stands to\nreason that you\nwant to get outside for\nat least two hours a day,\nwhich I know sounds like a lot,\nin order to prevent myopia,\nif you're a young person,\nand offset the progression of\nand maybe even\nreverse some myopia,\nwe don't know yet\nbased on the data,\nbut there's some\nindication that's\npossible, by getting\noutside two hours a day.\nAnd the cool thing is, because\nmany people, including myself,\nhave a lot of work to do and\nwe need to be on our phones\nquite a lot, or we choose to\nbe on our phones quite a lot,\nthis effect of getting sunlight\noutdoors during the daytime\nfor two hours or\nmore does not seem\nto require that you stay\noff your phone or tablet,\nor that you're looking at\nthings far in the distance\nthe entire time.\nWhat this means\nis, if you can get\noutside onto a patio or a deck\nor an outdoor table if you can,\nif weather and\nconditions permit,\nand do some of your phone time\nand computer time and reading,\net cetera, outdoors.\nNow, if you're already\nmaking an effort\nto get outside, hike,\nplay sports, take walks,\net cetera, that of course\ncounts towards this two hour\nthreshold.\nAnd I know this sounds\nlike a lot, this two hours,\nand yet for most people,\nit certainly will vary,\ndepending on time\nof year, but I think\nstriving to get on average\nabout two hours of outdoor time\nas much as you can or\nopening a window, which\nwouldn't be as good as getting\noutside, but opening a window\nand trying to get some natural\nlight exposure to the eye\nto trigger the activity,\nthese intrinsically\nphotosensitive melanopsin and\nretinal ganglion cells, that's\ngoing to be a really good idea\nin trying to offset and maybe\neven reverse some vision loss.\nNow, the other\nbehavioral protocols\nwhich have shown to be useful\nin terms of maintaining\nor improving vision relate to\nthe musculature around the eye\nand the control of the\nmovement of the lens.\nAnd actually, the lens of the\neye has its own flexibility.\nIt's a really, really\ninteresting structure.\nI'll geek out on\nthis far too long\nif I don't prevent\nmyself from doing so,\nbut the lens is just incredible.\nThe fact that it has a\nspecific structure of proteins\nlike crystallines and\nthings of that sort\nand that it can still derive\nnourishment from blood flow\nbut does not actually have\nvasculature within it.\nSo it's not-- if you notice\nthe lens of your eyes\nand filled with blood\nvessels and capillaries\nbecause it needs\nlight to pass through,\nsuper interesting\nstructure I think\nthe only violation of what\nI just said is the manatee.\nThose pigs are underwater,\nelephant-like creatures\nthat I think were\nor are endangered.\nDown in Florida, they\nwere getting chopped up\nby speedboats, but\nI think now there's\nsome effort to preserve\nthose big gentle giants.\nThe manatee, as I recall, has\na vascularized lens, which\nis why their eyes look opaque.\nIt looks like they\nhave cataracts.\nIn any case, you're\nnot a manatee.\nYou have no blood vessel\nsupply to the lens.\nKeeping that lens clear\nis vital nowadays.\nThey can do lens replacement.\nThere's really a pretty\nincredible progress\nin the realm of ophthalmology\nand surgical replacement\nof the lens or the cornea,\nother aspects of the eye.\nBut if you're somebody who\nis interested in maintaining\nyour vision, you're\ngoing to want\nto maintain the\nmusculature that controls\nthe movement and the change\nof shape in that lens\nand the movement of the eyes,\nwhich allows you to transition\nyour vision from very\nsharp when viewing things\nup close to very sharp one\nviewing things at a distance.\nAnd this is where some of the\nso-called near-far exercises\ncan be very useful.\nSo when we did a full\nlength podcast on eye health\nand improving eyesight,\nwhich I invite\nyou to listen to\nif you like, talked\nabout two different types\nof vision exercises that\nhave been shown to be\nuseful for improving vision\nat a level of acuity\nthat have a lot\nto do with improving the\nmusculature and the movement\nof the eyes and the lens.\nAnd that's what's called\na smooth pursuit task.\nSo you could go on to YouTube if\nyou like and put smooth pursuit\neye task and do this for\na few minutes each day\nif you're trying to\nkeep your vision strong.\nAnd what that task involves\nis, as the name suggests,\nsmoothly tracking a small\ndot or crosshatch or arrow\non the screen, which\nis very different\nthan the so-called\nsaccade type eye movements\nthat we often make.\nSaccades are when you dart your\neyes to a particular location\nto look at something that\ndart it to another location\nto look at something.\nMicrosaccades are\nlittle, tiny versions\nof those that were doing\nmost all of the time,\nbelieve it or not.\nWhen you look at a\nvisual scene or image,\nif you did not have those\nlittle microsaccades,\nyour brain would adapt\nor would attenuate\nto whatever you were looking\nat, and the visual image\nwould actually\ndisappear, which really\nspeaks to how important it is\nthat your perceptions change\nin order to maintain them.\nThis is very similar\nto where if something\nis placed on your\nhand, say a finger,\nyou'll notice that\nchange, but then\nif you leave it there\nfor a short while,\nyou'll forget that it's\nthere because the cells there\nhave adapted out.\nThere's no change.\nSo your nervous system is\nlargely responding to change.\nThis is also why when\nyou walk into a room\nand you'll often\nnotice a novel smell,\nlet's hope it's a good\nsmell, after a few minutes\nor so, you don't notice\nthe smell anymore\nbecause your olfactory\nsystem adapted that away.\nSo a lot of that\nadaptation is prevented\nby those little microsaccades.\nAnd the macrosaccades,\nthe bigger saccades,\nare really for moving\nyour eyes around\nto look for things\nin visual space.\nSmooth pursuit is a\nvery particular kind\nof visual behavior that you\ncan do in a smooth pursuit\ntask and zero cost.\nCosts a little bit of time I\nsuppose to do this on YouTube.\nAnd most any of them will do.\nWe can provide a link in the\nshow note captions of one\nthat we like or\nseveral that we like,\nbut by doing that smooth\npursuit task for a bit each day,\nmaybe just a minute\nor two, you're\nmaintaining your ability through\nthe musculature of the eye\nto do smooth pursuit.\nAnd, of course, you\ndo smooth pursuit\nwhen you move about\nyour day, but for people\nthat are trying to offset or\nreverse vision loss, doing\nsome additional deliberate\nsmooth pursuit exercises\ncan be useful.\nThe other visual exercise\nthat can be very useful\nis the so-called\nnear-far exercise.\nSo this is best\naccomplished, I think,\nby holding out a pen or\npencil in front of your eyes,\nin front of your head, and\nfocusing very intensely\nthrough what's called a vergence\neye movement, where you bring\nboth eyes to the tip of\nthe pen and then moving\nthat pen closer and closer\nand closer to your eyes,\nwhere you get close\nenough that you actually\nhave to deliberately\nbring your eyes--\nfor those of you\nlistening, this is\nwhat I'm doing right now-- to\nthe point where it's blurry\nand you can no longer hold\nit in sharp, crisp relief.\nYou can't see it\nsharply that is.\nAnd then you can move it\nout a little bit distance\nand play right\naround that threshold\nwhere it's hard to\nkeep it in focus\nand then move it back out again.\nAnd then in doing that for even\na minute or two, you'll find\nis a bit of a\nstrain on your eyes,\nbut you can actually\nbuild up the musculature\nand the neuromuscular\nconnections that allow you\nto do that more efficiently.\nAnd that has been\nshown to improve\ncertain aspects of vision,\nespecially when people\nare diligent about\ndoing those exercises,\nnot necessarily every\nday, but let's say\nthree days a week or so.\nThey can be very fast.\nI actually find\nthem fun for reasons\nthat escape me entirely.\nNow, how close you\ncan bring that object\nand still maintain\nit in sharp focus\nwill vary from person to person\nbased on a number of things.\nFirst of all, how healthy\nand well-performing\ntheir neural retina\nis, whether or not\nthey have myopia or hyperopia,\nnearsightedness, et cetera,\nwhether or not, for\ninstance, you're\nlike me and you have a fairly\nclose inter pupillary distance,\nor whether or not\nyou're more wall eyed\nand you have your eyes\nset further apart.\nAll those things will\ndictate the exact performance\nof that task, but\nnonetheless, it's\na very useful task to do when\ntrying to maintain or improve\nvision.\nNow, of course, there are\na lot more behavioral tools\nthat one could use to\nmaintain or enhance vision.\nI'm really touching\non the biggest\nand what I consider the\nmost important ones that\nare most accessible to\npeople without the need\nfor any fancy equipment at all.\nAnd if you want to learn more\nabout other behavioral tools\nthat one can use to\nmaintain or enhance vision,\nplease see the episode\nthat we did on eyesight.\nYou can simply go\nto hubermanlab.com.\nPut into the search\nfunction, eyesight or vision.\nIt'll take you right to it.\nIn fact, everything on that\nwebsite is keyword indexed\nand will take you to the\nvarious episodes and time stamps\nthat you're interested in\naccording to that keyword.\nNow, the person who asked\nthis question, who by the way,\nis Page Singer, thank\nyou Page Singer,\nand the question\ngot a lot of upvotes\nbecause apparently there's\na lot of interest in this,\nunderstandably so, asked about\nnutrition and supplements\nfor maintaining or\nimproving vision.\nThat could be a very\nlengthy conversation,\nbut let's just summarize\nit with a few brief points\nthat we know stand based on\nthe clinical and scientific\nresearch.\nWe've all heard that carrots\nare good for your eyes.\nWell, it's not carrots per se\nthat are good for your eyes.\nIt's vitamin A that's\nessential for the so-called\nphototransduction cascade.\nThe phototransduction\ncascade is the process\nby which the\nphotoreceptors, which\nare in the back of the retina,\nat least if you're human,\nthey're in the\nback of the retina,\ntake photons, light\nenergy, and convert it\ninto electrical\nsignals that's then\nconveyed to the other cells\nand neurons within the retina\nand then passed into the brain\nto create visual perceps.\nMost people can't get enough\nof this fat soluble vitamin,\nwe call vitamin\nA, by making sure\nthat they eat at least some\ndark green leafy vegetables.\nAnd that they do\nthat in their closest\nto raw form, maybe\ncooked a little bit\nbut not overly cooked.\nThere are other sources\nof vitamin A out.\nThere you can look those\nup online just for sources\nof vitamin A. Most people will\nbe able to get enough vitamin\nA from their nutrition and won't\nrequire it from a supplement,\nprovided that it's not present\nat excessively high levels\nin a foundational supplement\nor vitamin mineral supplement.\nGetting some\nadditional vitamin A\nfrom a foundational supplement\nor vitamin mineral supplement\nis probably not going to be\nan issue unless you really\ntake in far too\nmuch of that vitamin\nA. It could potentially\nprovide some insurance.\nBut, again, I think most\npeople can get enough vitamin\nA from their diet if\nthey are taking carrots\nor to eat the foods\nthat contain vitamin A,\ngreen leafy\nvegetables being one.\nThe other food that's known to\nbe highly enriched in vitamin A\nis liver, one of my least\nfavorite foods regardless\nof what animal that\nliver comes from.\nLiver is somewhat of a\npopular/controversial organ\nmeat in the nutrition\nspace for reasons\nthat aren't interesting,\nfor sake of this discussion\nanyway I suppose\nfor those of you\nthat like liver, you could\neat a little bit of liver\nevery once in a while.\nIt is rich in a number of things\nthat are beneficial to health,\nalthough for you\nvegans out there,\nI'm sure you'll want to\navoid liver entirely.\nI avoid liver\nbecause I just simply\ndon't like the way it tastes.\nMaybe once or twice\nI've tasted liver\nthat was appetizing to me.\nAnd it can be OK, but it's just\nnot, or at least by my read it,\ncan be OK, but it's not\na food that I actively\nseek out, order, or prepare\nfor myself on a regular basis.\nSo fortunately, there are other\nsources of vitamin A as well.\nAnd, again, I just invite you to\nall put into a web search food\nsources of vitamin\nand figure out\nhow to get your daily\ndose of vitamin A\nby taking in foods\nthat you like for you.\nAnd then in terms\nof supplementation\nof things that can enhance\nvision, this is a newer area.\nAnd frankly, it's an area\nwhere most of the data\npoint to some supplements\nthat can potentially\nbe beneficial in certain\ndisease conditions.\nSo for instance, in fairly\nprogressed age-related macular\ndegeneration.\nAge-related macular\ndegeneration is\nfairly common, or more\ncommon than we would like,\nwe should say.\nAnd it does appear\nthat supplementing\nwith certain things like lutein,\nwhich is present in eggs,\nor egg yolks in particular,\nespecially egg yolks that\naren't overly cooked, or\nthat can be supplemented\ncan potentially help\nwith some instances\nof age-related\nmacular degeneration.\nBut the data on this\nare still emerging.\nI consulted with our\nchair of ophthalmology\nat Stanford about lutein\nand some of the other things\nthat you'll see out there, like\nzeaxanthin and astaxanthins.\nAnd these xanthins come\nfrom certain fruits\nlike blueberries, and they're\npresent in supplements\nand things of that sort.\nThe consensus I\ngot talking to him\nand talking to some\nother ophthalmologists\nare that if you're really\naiming to get a healthy diet,\nyou're avoiding\ncigarette smoking.\nAnd by healthy\ndiet I mean getting\nsufficient amounts of\nvitamin A and lutein\nthrough food sources.\nAgain, you can look up where\nthose food sources are,\negg yolks just\nbeing one of them.\nWell, then chances\nare you're not\ngoing to need to supplement\nwith lutein or the zeaxanthins\nor the astaxanthins.\nHowever, I have heard anecdotal\nreports from a number of people\nthat they'll start taking a\nsupplement for eye health,\nthere are a number\nof them out there--\nwe are not, as a\npodcast, affiliate\nwith any of those eye health\nsupplements by the way--\nand people are reporting\nenhanced vision.\nI receive emails all\nthe time that say, I'm\ntaking this lutein at\n20 milligrams per day,\nand there I should mention\nthat the dosage that's\nbeen explored in a\ncouple of studies\nis 10 to 20 milligrams per day.\nAgain, you could\nget that from foods.\nYou could go above that\nif you're more cavalier,\nor you could go toward\nthe lower end of that,\n10 to 20 milligrams per\nday, if you are somebody\nwho's more conservative.\nI should say.\nWell, there aren't\npeople out there who are,\nlooking at lutein, they\nthink it's fairly safe,\nand they're taking\nhigher dosages of lutein,\nso 20 to 30 milligrams per day.\nThey're also taking\nsupplements that\ncontain zeaxanthins\nand astaxanthins\nand are reporting anecdotally\nthat their vision is enhanced.\nI don't dispute those\nclaims, but as of now, there\naren't many papers, I\ncould only find about 4,\n3 really solid ones and\nthen a fourth, that point\nto the specific\ndisease instances\nwhere supplementing with lutein,\nzeaxanthin, or astaxanthin\ncan be beneficial for slowing\nthe progression of things\nlike advanced onset age-related\nmacular degeneration.\nAnd the degree of offset for\nthat macular degeneration\nwas slight.\nIt wasn't enormous, but\nit was robust enough\nthat it warranted\nreporting in the paper.\nOr things like Lieber's, which\nis a particular eye disease.\nIt impacts a whole different\nset of systems in the eye.\nSo basically, what\nI'm trying to say\nis, when it comes to supplements\nto support eye health,\nmake sure you're getting enough\nvitamin A from your diet.\nIf you're not, consider\nsupplementation\nor consider changing\nyour diet somewhat\nto make sure you can get\nthat lutein and vitamin A.\nAnd if you are interested in\nit, and it's within your budget,\nI don't know of any\nevidence that supplementing\nwith additional lutein,\nzeaxanthin, and astaxanthin\ncan be dangerous at all.\nSo for those of\nyou that are really\ninterested in maintaining\nor improving your vision,\nthat might be an area\nthat you want to explore.\nI personally am not\ntaking lutein, zeaxanthin,\nor astaxanthin, at\nleast not at this time.\nI do take a\nfoundational supplement,\nwhich is my source of vitamin A\nin addition to my food sources.\nBut I don't suffer\nfrom vision loss\nanywhere, readers at night,\nand I have for a long time.\nI have a little bit\nof a muscular weakness\nin one of my eyes that\noriginated in childhood.\nSo occasionally, if I get\nvery fatigued, one of my eyes\nwill deviate a little\nbit, a little bit\nof almost strabismus,\nespecially if I've been awake\nfor very long periods of time.\nIt tends to recover once I\nget a good night's sleep.\nSome of you that\nhave experienced\nthis, where you\nhave one eye that\nmight just drift a little bit.\nI could do this for\nthe camera if you want.\nOK, this is weird.\nI used to do this to my\nsister across the table when\nwe were at a friend's\nhouses for dinner.\nSo I can actually\nmove one of my eyes\nin like this, which\nactually just reflects\nthat there's a extraocular\nmuscle closer to my nose.\nIt's rather weak, which\nallows me to do that.\nI can't do it so well\nwith the opposite eye.\nAnyway, now I need to\nblink to clear my vision.\nBut the point is that,\nif you're somebody\nwho has a slightly\ndeviating eye, slightly,\noften if you go to the\nophthalmologist or optometrist,\nthey're going to give\nyou a prism lens which\nis going to redirect the\nimage onto that slightly\ndeflected eyeball.\nOne thing you'll\nreally want to discuss\nwith that ophthalmologist or\noptometrist is whether or not\nthere are exercises that\nyou could do to overcome\nthat issue without the need\nfor a prism because what I saw\nand what many other people see\nwhen they put on a prism lens\nis that indeed it can\nline up their vision\nor their visual\nperception better,\nbut indeed, it can lead\nto progressive weakening\nof the muscle\nfurther and further.\nSo then that eyeball starts to\ndeviate further and further.\nAnd that raises a larger\nquestion, which is,\nshould we wear\ncorrective lenses?\nIn fact, if you\ngo online, you'll\nfind or hear about\nthese examples\nof people that stopped wearing\ntheir corrective lenses,\ntheir glasses or\ncontacts, in order\nto bring their vision\nback or improve\ntheir vision on their own.\nNow, if your vision\nis quite impaired,\nyou're going to need\ncorrective lenses or contacts.\nHowever, there are a\nnumber of people out there\nwho find that if their\nvision is somewhat impaired,\nthat forcing themselves to\nview things at a distance\nto do smooth pursuit,\nto do near far,\nand to make sure that they're\ngetting adequate nutrition\nand things of that\nsort, can all sum\nto help offset some of the\nvisual impairment that would\noccur if they were to just\npop glasses on their face\nand rely on the\ncorrective lenses\nin order to focus the light onto\nthe correct area within the eye\nonto the neural retina.\nSo I'm not telling people\nto throw off or get rid\nof their corrective\nlenses and contacts,\nbut you can be overly reliant\non these things, like a crutch,\nin a way that perhaps you want\nto do a little bit of work\nto try and overcome\nand then maybe work\nwith a weaker prescription.\nAnd certainly, in the\ncase of prism lenses,\nwhat I mentioned before\nis a real consideration.\nIt's one I'm very familiar with.\nSo as a last but I\nthink very important\nand exciting feature of visual\nimprovement is red light.\nI talked a little bit about this\non the episode of the Huberman\nLab podcast all about\nlight and health.\nThere's some really\nspectacular, I\nthink I consider it spectacular,\nmany other people consider\nit spectacular, research out\nof University College London.\nAnd the work I'm referring\nto is Glenn Jeffrey's work.\nI've known Glenn\nfor a long time.\nThese are animal studies,\nand now two human studies,\nexploring how exposure to\nred light early in the day\ncan offset some of the\nvision loss related\nto age-related macular\ndegeneration, or simply\nage-related visual decline.\nThere's a whole\nmechanism here that's\ndiscussed in that episode,\nbut it has to do with the fact\nthat red light and near-infrared\nlight, together, or maybe\neven separately, when viewed\nfor even just a minute\nto 3 minutes once, or maybe\ntwo or three times per week\nmaximum, can actually\nreduce the number of what\nare called reactive oxygen\nspecies in the photoreceptors\nthat convert photons\ninto electrical signals\nthe rest of the visual\nsystem can understand.\nSo that's a mouthful.\nBasically what they found was,\nfor people 40 years or older,\nif they viewed this red\nlight at a distance of about\na foot and a half,\nalthough I wouldn't\nget too specific with this, for\na few minutes each week total,\nthey were able to offset\nsome of the vision loss\nwithin a particular\ndomain of vision.\nAnd I don't have time\nto go into the details\nhere because I do that in\nthe Light for Health episode,\nbut you have different types\nof photoreceptors, cones,\nand rods.\nYou have different types\nof cone photoreceptors\nthat respond to different\nwavelengths of light,\nshort, medium, and long\nwavelengths of light\nso-called blue,\ngreen, and red cones,\nthey're sometimes called.\nWhen these people who\nare 40 years or older\nviewed red light on a consistent\nbasis early in the day,\nand it did have to\nbe early in the day,\nthere was a real\ncircadian effect there,\nthere was a offset of\nsome of the vision loss\nthat would normally occur\nin a particular wavelength\nof light range that resulted in\nbetter visual acuity overall.\nSo if you're very concerned\nabout your vision,\nor you're into red light\ntherapies, et cetera,\nthere are a number of different\nred light devices out there.\nAt some future point,\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nmay partner with one of\nthese red light companies.\nSo right now, I'm not going\nto mention any of them\nin particular.\nThey're prominent online.\nWhat you're looking for is a\nred light unit that provides\nred light and maybe far--\nnear infrared-- excuse\nme-- light as well.\nSo something in the 650 to\n720 ish nanometer range.\nSo really it's going to\nlook red or almost invisible\nto you if it's really\nfar into the infrared.\nAnd you'll want to view\nthat at a distance of about\na foot and a half to 2 feet.\nAnd you don't want\nit to be so bright\nthat it's painful to\nlook at because you\ndon't want to damage your eyes.\nBut that's essentially what\nthey used in these studies\nfrom the Jeffrey lab.\nAnd they showed some\npretty impressive\noffset of some of the\naspects of vision loss\nin these people 40 and older.\nSo that's an area\nthat you may want\nto explore as well, especially\nfor folks 40 and older.\nAnd, again, this\nred light exposure\nhad to be done early in the day.\nSo hopefully, that collection\nof behavioral tools near, far,\nsmooth pursuit, some of the\ndiscussion about lutein,\nnutrition, vitamin A,\nsupplementation, zeaxanthins,\nastaxanthins, getting two\nhours of light exposure\noutside, sunlight exposure,\nget outside to do some\nof your work, and perhaps even\ndeliberate red light exposure\nfor certain people can be\nused to offset your concerns\nand your action\npotential vision loss\nand maybe even improve your\nvision regardless of what age\nyou are.\nEverything I\ndescribed is supported\nfrom the Peer-reviewed\nliterature.\nAnd, again, if you want to\nget the deep dive on mechanism\nand further information\nabout dosages,\nplease check out the\nepisode on eyesight\nand improving your eyesight and\nthe Light for Health episode\nagain at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast,\nand to fund research, in\nparticular research done\non human beings, so\nnot animal models\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all agree\nis the species that we\nare most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels, not\njust the premium channel\nbut through all channels,\nHuberman Lab podcast\nand other media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions, in depth, and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the tiny\nfoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raised\nfor research through\nthe premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science-related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMAs.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,\nand you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMAs and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman Lab podcast episodes\nand not found elsewhere.\nAnd, again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
