    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we are\ndiscussing mental training and\nvisualization\nmental training and visualization is a\nfascinating process that has been shown\nover and over again in now hundreds of\nstudies to improve our ability to learn\nanything when I say anything I mean the\nability to learn music the ability to\nlearn and perform mathematics the\nability to learn and perform motor\nskills in sport in dance across\nessentially all domains the other\nincredible thing about mental training\nand visualization is that as you'll soon\nsee when you go into the literature that\nis the scientific studies on mental\ntraining and visualization you quickly\nrealize that it does not take a lot of\nmental training and visualization in\norder to get better at anything however\nthat mental training and visualization\nhas to be performed in a very specific\nway and today we will discuss exactly\nhow to do mental training and\nvisualization in the specific ways that\nallow it to complement the actual\nperformance of a motor or cognitive\nskill to allow you to learn more quickly\nand to consolidate that is to keep that\ninformation in mind and body so that you\ncan perform those cognitive tasks music\ntasks motor tasks etc for long periods\nof time without ever forgetting how to\ndo them all of mental training and\nvisualization relies on what I consider\nreally the Holy Grail of our brain and\nnervous system and that's\nneuroplasticity neuroplasticity is our\nnervous system which of course includes\nthe brain the spinal cord and all the\nconnections between the brain and spinal\ncord and the organs and tissues of the\nbody and then all the neural connections\nback from the organs and tissues of the\nbody to the brain and spinal cord so the\nwhole thing in both directions\nhas the ability to change in response to\nexperience in ways that are adaptive\nthat is that allows us to do things that\nwe could not do before and by doing\nthose things or by being able to perform\nthose mental operations we can do better\nin the world that we live in we can\nperform new tasks we can think new\nthoughts we can come up with novel\nsolutions to pre-existing problems that\nbefore really vexed us and that we\ncouldn't overcome all of that is\nconsidered neuroplasticity so today what\nI'm going to cover is a brief summary of\nwhat neuroplasticity is that is how it\noccurs in the brain and body this is\nextremely important to understand if\nyou're going to use Mental training and\nvisualization then I'm going to talk\nabout what happens in our brain and body\nwhen we do mental visualization in a\ndedicated way many people have heard\nperhaps that when you imagine something\nhappening that your brain doesn't know\nthe difference between that imagination\nof the thing happening and the real\nthing happening turns out that is not\ntrue it is simply not true however there\nis somewhat of an equivalence between a\nreal experience and an imagined\nexperience and we'll talk about the\ndifference between those and how that\ncan be leveraged in order to get the\nmost out of mental training and\nvisualization then I will cover exactly\nwhich types of mental training and\nvisualization work best across all\ndomains meaning for Music Learning\nmathematics\nsolving puzzles motor learning Sports\nPerformance\netc etc to really allow you a template\nin which you can plug in or designate\nwhat you're going to do each day for a\nbrief period of time in order to\naccelerate your learning in whatever you\nchoose and then I'm going to go into a\nbit of what happens in the brains of\ndifferent types of people these\ndifferent types of people that I'm\nreferring to are people who have more or\nless of a natural ability to imagine\nthings and visualize them because it\nturns out that we vary tremendously from\none individual to the next in terms of\nour ability to mentally visualize and\nimagine things and our ability to get\nbetter at that over time and the good\nnews is anyone can get better at mental\ntraining and visualization in ways that\ncan serve them well I'll also briefly\ntouch on the fact that certain people in\nparticular people on the autism spectrum\nas well as people with synesthesias\nwhich is the combining of different\nperceptual experiences so you may be one\nof these people or you may have heard of\npeople that for instance when they think\nof a number they also just naturally\nspontaneously think of a color and vice\nversa we'll talk about how that relates\nto mental imagery and visualization and\nthe creative process and problem solving\nin general\nand then finally what I'll do is I'll\nrecap mental training and visualization\nfrom the standpoint of how best to apply\nmental training and visualization\naccording to specific challenges things\nlike challenges with public speaking or\nchallenges with sports performance or\nchallenges with test taking Performance\nchallenges with essentially anything\nthat will allow you to build specific\nmental training and visualization\npractices that are brief that are\nsupported by Neuroscience studies and\nthat are highly effective before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nelement element is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need meaning\nsodium magnesium and potassium but\nnothing that you don't meaning no sugar\nand it has the sodium magnesium\npotassium in the ideal ratios for\nhydrating and providing electrolytes to\nthe cells and tissues of your body so I\nuse element in my water when I wake up I\nlike to hydrate right away so I'll have\nan element packet in about 16 to 32\nounces of water when I wake up I tend to\ndo the same while I exercise which I\ntypically do in the morning sometimes in\nthe afternoon and I'll drink another one\nthroughout the day the great thing about\nelement is also tastes terrific\nI particularly like the watermelon\nflavor but frankly I like all the\nflavors just mixed into again about 16\nto 32 ounces of water if you'd like to\ntry element you can go to drink element\nlmnt.com huberman to claim a free\nelement sample pack with your purchase\nagain that's drink element lmnt.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Maui Nui venison which I can\nconfidently say is the most nutrient\ndense and delicious red meat available\nMaui Nui spent nearly a decade building\na USDA certified wild harvesting system\nto help balance deer populations on the\nisland of Maui the solution they built\nis extremely powerful because it turns\nthe proliferation of an invasive species\ninto a wide range of nutrient dense\nproducts from butcher Cuts so venison\nsteaks and ground venison Etc to organ\nMeats bone broth and jerky I really love\nall of their products so I love the\nvenison steaks and the ground venison\nand their bone broth is fantastic it has\nan unmatched 25 grams of protein per 100\ncalories so it's very high density High\nhigh quality protein per calorie so if\nyou'd like to try Maui Nui venison go to\nMaui Nui venison.com huberman to get 20\noff your first order again that's Maui\nNews venison.com huberman to get 20 off\nyour first order today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by eight sleep eight sleep\nmakes Smart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity I've\ntalked many times before on this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance now one of the\nkey features to getting a good night's\nsleep is making sure that you get the\ntemperature of the environment you sleep\nin right\nthat's because in order to fall asleep\nand stay deeply asleep throughout the\nnight your core body temperature needs\nto drop by about one to three degrees\nconversely in order to wake up in the\nmorning feeling refreshed and ready to\ngo your core body temperature needs to\ngo up by about one to three degrees of\ncourse you can adjust the temperature of\nthe room that you sleep in I do hope\nthat people are doing that but adjusting\nthe temperature of your mattress and\nyour direct sleeping environment is also\nkey and with the eight sleep it makes it\nvery easy to program the temperature of\nthat mattress in a sleep environment not\njust throughout the night but for\nspecific phases of the night I start\nsleeping on an eight-sleep mattress\ncover well over a year ago and it's the\nbest sleep that I've ever had if you'd\nlike to try eight sleep you can go do\neightsleep.com huberman and check out\nthe Pod Pro cover and save 150 at\ncheckout eight sleep currently ships in\nthe USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's\neightsleep.com huberman to save 150 at\ncheckout let's talk about mental\ntraining and visualization\nnow perhaps surprisingly mental training\nvisualization has been studied since the\nlate 1800s it's actually a paper\npublished in 1880 by Galton called the\nstatistics of mental imagery so long ago\npeople were quantifying and trying to\nunderstand how is it that people come up\nwith mental images and how they can\napply that to learning things more\nquickly and more stably over time\nnow as I mentioned earlier mental\ntraining and visualization relies on a\nprocess that we call neuroplasticity\nneuroplasticity is a term that many\npeople have heard and encompasses many\ndifferent things so broadly speaking\nneuroplasticity includes developmental\nplasticity which is the sort of\nplasticity that occurs between about\nbirth and age 25 and that can be\nsummarized very easily as passive\nplasticity in other words the sorts of\nchanges that happen in one's nervous\nsystem simply by engaging in the world\nand experiencing Life as a child as a\nyoung adult as an adolescent and as a 22\n23 24 year old Etc now of course of\ncourse of course it is not the case that\non your 25th birthday you close out\npassive developmental plasticity and\nstart engaging in the other type of\nneuroplasticity which is adult\nneuroplasticity it's a gradual tapering\noff of Developmental plasticity that\noccurs between age zero and 25 and for\nsome people might occur somewhere around\n26 for other people around 23\nwhen we say 25 we're really just talking\nabout the average age in which passive\nplasticity tapers off however starting\nfairly early in adolescence and\nextending all the way out into one's 80s\nor 90s or hundreds should one live that\nlong is the other form of\nneuroplasticity which is adult\nneuroplasticity\nadult neuroplasticity is very different\nthan developmental plasticity because it\nis the sort of plasticity that one can\ndirect towards one's own specific\ndesired learning so if we wanted to get\na little bit technical here for sake of\nclarity not for sake of confusion we\nwould say adult plasticity is really\nabout self-directed adaptive plasticity\nand the reason we call it that as\nopposed to something else where simply\nadult plasticity is that there are many\ndifferent forms of neuroplasticy there\nis for instance maladaptive\nneuroplasticity that occurs if one gets\na really hard head hit and concussion\nthere will be changes to the brain and\nnervous system but those changes to the\nbrain and nervous system do not allow it\nto perform better in fact it often\nimpairs the brain and nervous system's\nability to function and therefore is\nmaladaptive so I don't want to get\noverly wordy with a number of different\nterms here but I do think it's important\nto understand that we have developmental\nplasticity again in which the brain and\nnervous system changes simply in\nresponse to experiencing specific things\nfor better or worse and there's adult\nself-directed adaptive plasticity in\nwhich one can direct specific changes in\nterms of learning things cognitively or\nlearning things in terms of motor\nfunction so sport Dance Etc or a\ncombination of the two now just to\nreally clarify what I mean by\ndevelopmental versus self-directed\nadaptive plasticity I mentioned that\nself-directed adaptive plasticity\nactually can start in adolescence right\neven though there's ongoing\ndevelopmental plasticity I mean let's be\nreally direct the brain of a 14 year old\nis very different than the brain of that\nsame individual when that person is 21.\nbecause there's ongoing developmental\nplasticy however starting at about\nadolescence we can all start to decide\nwhat it is that we want to learn and\nengage in self-directed adaptive\nplasticity now the way to engage\nself-directed adaptive plasticity\nregardless of whether or not you're a 13\nyear old 14 year old or you're a 90 year\nold or anywhere in between is that it\nrequires two things\nthe first thing it requires is focused\ndedicated attention to the thing that\nyou're trying to learn that's the first\nstep and that actually triggers a number\nof different chemical and electrical\nprostheses in the brain that are often\nassociated with agitation and\nfrustration believe it or not the\nagitation and frustration is a\nreflection of the release of specific\nchemicals in particular norepinephrine\nand epinephrine also called\nnoradrenaline and adrenaline in the\nbrain and body that creates this\ndiscomfort and this heightened level of\nalertness and attention that many of us\ndon't like and tend to back away from\nbut it is exactly that chemical or I\nshould say neurochemical milieu which\nsignals to the neurons the nerve cells\nin the brain and elsewhere in the body\nthat something needs to change because\nif you think about it if you can do\nsomething perfectly or if you try and do\nsomething and it doesn't cause any\nneurochemical change in your brain and\nbody well then there's no reason for\nyour brain and its connections with the\nbody to change in any particular way\nokay so you need focused dedicated\nattention to the thing that you're\ntrying to learn it's off often\naccompanied by agitation frustration Etc\nso that's perfectly normal in fact\nthat's a signal that things are going\nright meaning they're headed towards\nlearning but there's a second component\nthat's really required for self-directed\nadaptive plasticity and that's periods\nof deep rest in particular a good\nnight's sleep in particular on the night\nthat follows that focused attention to\nthe thing you're trying to learn there\nare now hundreds of studies in both\nanimal models and in humans showing that\nit is really during sleep and other\nstates of deep relaxation things like\nmeditation and non-sleep deep rest which\nI've talked about before on this podcast\nbut really during our main night of\nsleep that the rewiring of neural\nconnections that is the actual\nneuroplasticity takes place so the verb\nneuroplasticity the rearrangement of\nconnections between neurons really\noccurs during sleep in particular on the\nfirst night following an attempt to\nlearn something through this focused\nattention now developmental plasticity\nwhich is passive also requires good\nsleep sleep it's slightly different or\nfrankly it's a lot different in terms of\nthe underlying mechanisms than\nself-directed adaptive plasticity but\nbecause today we're mainly talking about\nhow to learn faster through mental\ntraining and visualization and that\nreally Maps more closely onto\nself-directed adaptive plasticity I just\nreally want to emphasize this two-step\nprocess there has to be focused\ndedicated attention and then there needs\nto be sleep and in particular sleep on\nthe first night following that training\nnow should you have the unfortunate\nexperience of getting woken up in the\nmiddle of the night following trying to\nlearn something or should you simply not\nbe able to sleep for whatever reason on\nthe night following a bout of learning\nor an attempt to learn do not despair\nbecause it turns out that there are what\nare called second and third night\neffects also once you sleep you will\nlearn those neuroplastic events the\nreordering of connections that we call\nsynapses and the changes that occur in\nneural circuits that reflects what we\ncall self-directed adaptive plasticity\nthat still will occur her but ideally\nyou got a great night's sleep on the\nfirst night following trying to learn\nand the second night and the third and\nso on and so on now there are a few\nother things that are critical to\nunderstand about self-directed adaptive\nplasticity that will become especially\nimportant when thinking about protocols\nfor developing the ideal mental training\nand visualization process for you and\nthat is that there are different forms\nof plasticity that occur between neurons\nalthough the two main forms are what are\ncalled long-term potentiation and\nlong-term depression I just want to cue\nup right now that the word depression is\na very loaded word because the moment\npeople hear the word depression they\nthink oh no that's bad\nbut in the case of neuroplasticity\nlong-term depression is simply a change\nin the connections between neurons and\nthe excitability between neurons that in\nmany ways can be excellent for learning\nthings in particular motor skills and\nwe'll get into this in more detail in a\nlittle bit but it turns out that a lot\nof our ability to get better at some\nsort of motor skill involves this thing\nthat we call long-term depression and\nthat's because much of what is happening\nwhen we learn a new motor skill is that\nwe are depressing or suppressing\nspecific actions in order to generate a\nvery specific coordinated action\nsome of the best examples of long-term\ndepression can actually be borrowed from\ndevelopmental plasticity so for instance\nif you've ever sat across from an infant\nwho is trying to eat their meal so\nimagine a one and a half year old or a\ntwo-year-old trying to eat some noodles\nor some soup or any kind of baby\nsuitable food with a spoon and they're\nholding the spoon or they're trying to\nhold the spoon what you'll notice is\nthat their motor movements are terribly\nuncoordinated\nthey often will take that spoon to their\ncheek or to their eye to their head\nwe've all seen these very amusing photos\nof babies with bowls of food on their\nhead or with food all over their face or\njust everywhere it's appears that\nthey're basically getting the food\neverywhere except where it's supposed to\ngo which is in their mouth and that's\nbecause their motor movements are not\nvery well coordinated at that age and\nthey're not very well coordinated not\nbecause they lack sufficient numbers of\nneural connection synapses between\nneurons but rather because they have too\nmany connections between too many\ndifferent neurons the neural circuits\nthat control very dedicated coordinated\nmovement are not there yet instead too\nmany neurons are connected to too many\nother neurons and so they can't generate\nthe precise movements that are required\nin order to get that spoon to their\nmouth now over time they get better at\nmoving the utensil to their mouth\nsuch that hopefully by about age five or\nsix they are eating you know in a\nrelatively cleaner way and hopefully by\ntime they're 10 or 11 or 12 they're\ngetting the food into their mouth and\nnot all over their face people learn\nthis to varying degrees all you have to\ndo is go to a restaurant and watch how\npeople eat\num and you will see a vast variation in\npeople's coordinated movements with\nutensils but in general there's a theme\nthe younger the person the more\nuncoordinated their movement of utensils\nand as they get older the more\ncoordinated now of course in people that\nare very old they have challenges moving\nobjects\nand their limbs in very smooth ways and\nthat has to do with a topic that we'll\nget into when we talk about age-related\ncognitive decline and motor related\ndementias but for sake of today's\ndiscussion if you just want to think\nabout what happens with long-term\ndepression and the development of a\nmotor skill both as a baby as an\nadolescent and as an adult when you're\ntrying to learn a new motor skill is\nthat you are eliminating incorrect\nmovements and when you are eliminating\nincorrect movements to arrive at only\nthe correct movements in a very\nreflexive and repeated way so think your\ngolf swing your tennis serve I think\nserving a volleyball think a child\nlearning to crawl and then walk think a\nchild learning to eat with utensils an\nexample I gave before what's happening\nin all of those cases is that yes\ncertain Connections in the brain are\nbeing strengthened or what we call\npotentiated they are undergoing\nlong-term potentiation the so-called\nquote unquote fire together wired\ntogether Mantra that was popularized by\nthe great neurobiologist Dr Carla Schatz\nmy colleague at Stanford\nbut in addition to that long-term\ndepression the quieting or the silencing\nof specific synapses that is connections\nbetween neurons is absolutely critical\nfor motor skill learning so we have ltp\nlong-term potentiation and LTD long-term\ndepression is every bit as important as\nltp long-term potentiation for getting\nbetter at some sort of motor skill and\nindeed it getting better at some sort of\ncognitive skill now as we hear this this\nshould be intuitive to all of us if you\nlook at somebody's attempt to learn a\nparticular dance step or at somebody's\nattempt to do a tennis serve the first\ntime it's all over the place now it's\nnot perhaps all over the place in that\nthey're doing a jumping jack while\ntrying to serve the tennis ball but\nthey're generally arcing the racket too\nwidely on one trial and then they're\narcing it too close to their body on the\nnext trial so if we were to draw a line\nover each one of those trials we would\nsee that there were lines everywhere\nover time whereas once they quote\nunquote affect the tennis serve it's\ngoing to be line drawn directly over\nline draw and directly over line meaning\nthe Arc of that tennis serve is going to\nbe very restricted and that without\nquestion has reflected the removal or\nthe quieting of particular synapses\nconnections between neurons in the brain\nand body to allow that very narrow\ncoordinated and directed movement the\nsame is true for learning anything in\nthe cognitive domain meaning if you are\nto learn a language\nit is not of course the case that you\nknow every word in that language and\nthen you simply remove certain words and\narrive at the correct sentence structure\nthat you're trying to achieve but rather\nyou have to suppress your native\nlanguage or if you're a young child you\nhave to suppress the generation of just\nkind of random babbling sounds turns out\nbabbling isn't random at all but the\npoint is that you have to suppress\nthe enunciation of particular sounds and\ndirect the pronunciation of other sounds\nin order to generate that new language\nor your ability to speak at all okay so\nwe can really think about\nneuroplasticity as both a building up\nprocess in which you increase connection\nso-called long-term potentiation and a\nsculpting down or a removal of\nconnections process that we're going to\ncall long-term depression now I have to\nacknowledge that of course there are\nother forms of neuroplasticity too I\nknow there are probably some aficionados\nlistening to this\nwho will be perhaps shouting back at uh\nwhatever device my voice is coming out\nof wait what about Spike timing\ndependent plasticity or what about\npaired pulse facilitation yes yes and\nyes there are multiple forms of\ncommunication between neurons that can\nstrengthen those connections or weaken\nthose connections but for today's\ndiscussion we just broadly want to think\nabout long-term potentiation and\nlong-term depression because it captures\nthe two most important themes related to\nmental training and visualization which\nis that when we perform a given\ncognitive or physical task in the real\nworld so we actually try the dance step\nor the tennis serve or when we actually\ntry a math problem or we try and learn\nsome specific knowledge and write it\ndown and remember it\nthat is engaging particular neurons\nright they're firing they're releasing\nchemicals\nbut it is also actively suppressing the\nactivity of other neurons and we are\nalways completely unaware of the ways in\nwhich our brain is suppressing certain\nactivity okay so today we have to keep\nin mind that where there is\nstrengthening of connections there is\nalso weakening of connections and when\nit comes to mental training and\nvisualization and here's the really key\npoint with mental training and\nvisualization you are capturing both\nprocesses both the potentiation that is\nthe building up and strengthening of\nconnections and the weakening of the\nconnections that are inappropriate for\nthe thing you're trying to learn and\nthere are different aspects of mental\ntraining and visualization protocols\nthat really harness the potentiation\nversus the depression aspect and today\nwe will cover mental training and\nvisualization protocols that capture\nboth the potentiation and the depression\naspect of neuroplasticity and in that\nway serve as an augment that is a\ncomplement to the actual real world\ncognitive and physical training that\nyou're doing because I'll just give this\naway right now turns out that mental\ntraining and visualization is not a\nreplacement for real-world cognitive or\nmotor Behavior\nagain mental training and visualization\ncannot replace\nreal world execution of cognitive tasks\nor of motor tasks if you want to learn\nhowever mental training and\nvisualization can and has been shown to\nbe effective for greatly enhancing the\nspeed at which you learn and the\nstability of that learning over time\nokay so let's take a second and really\nthink about what's happening in the\nbrain and body when we do mental\ntraining or visualization in fact we can\ndo a little experiment right now that is\nnot unlike many of the classic\nexperiments looking at what's happening\nin the brain and body through mental\ntraining and visualization in which I\njust ask you to close your eyes and\nimagine a yellow Cube okay and next to\nthat yellow cube is a red rose\nand perhaps I also ask you to\nfloat or fly up above the cube and the\nrows and look at them from the top\ndown\nand then I tell you to fly back around\nand land behind those and look at them\nfrom the perspective of behind that\nyellow Cube and that red rose okay now\nwhat the data tell us is that most\npeople will be able to do that most of\nyou will be able to do that to some\ndegree or another regardless of your\nattention span whether or not you have\nADHD or not most of you will be able to\ndo that to some degree or another we\nalso know from neuroimaging studies in\nwhich people are placed into a\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging\nscanner that during the sort of\nvisualization you just did or that I\ndescribed that your visual cortex and\nAssociated areas quote unquote light up\nthey become very active in similar but\nnot identical ways to how they would\nlight up and be activated were you to\nactually look at a yellow cube and a red\nrose on a screen and perhaps Fly Above\nthem virtually of course and land behind\nthem virtually of course or if you were\nto actually look at a yellow Cube and\nred rose in the real world right in\nfront of you on a table then you know\nget up on your tippy toes and look down\non them from the top and then walk\naround the table and look at them from\nthe other side so there is some degree\nof what we call perceptual equivalence\nbetween real world experiences digital\nexperiences and imagined meaning with\nour eyes closed just in our Mind's Eye\nexperiences\nthis is true not just of vision and what\nwe call the visual domain but also the\nauditory domain okay so for instance I\ncould play for you a short motif of a\nsong Let's just pick something that I\nthink most people know goodness I'm a\nterrible musician and even worse um\nsinger but let's just take the the\nopening to AC DC's Back in Black right I\nthink I can do that when it's like\n[Music]\nokay got it\nthat's the actual sound although\nadmittedly a dreadful version of of the\ngreat AC DC song Back in Black but now I\nask you to close your eyes or we could\nkeep them open and just imagine that\nokay\nor for instance I\nplace you in a quiet room so you close\nyour eyes and ask you to imagine the\nopening to AC DC's black and black but\nask you to pause it halfway through what\nyou would find again is that most people\nsomewhere between 90 and 95 of people\nwould be able to do all the sorts of\nthings I described right Cube and Rose\nACD Back in Black\neven a somatosensory task I imagine you\nneed to imagine what it's like to touch\nfelt or to touch chinchilla hair or\nsomething like that H Chinchilla's hair\nideally a live chinchilla sitting still\nthose little critters move really really\nfast but they have very very soft hair\nHigh hair density so soft\nokay most people can do that\nabout five to fifteen percent of people\nare less able to do that and there's a\nsmall percentage of people in that five\nto fifteen percent\nthat simply cannot do it at all that\njust cannot visualize well we'll talk\nlater about these people they have\nwhat's called aphantasia an inability to\nmentally visualize but most people are\nactually pretty good at visualizing\nthings when they are told what to\nvisualize and and this is a really key\npoint and if what they are told to\nvisualize is very simple and the whole\nvisualization is quite brief lasting on\nthe order of about 15 seconds to\ngenerate the visualization in the\nauditory or in the visual aspect of\none's Minds I or ear if you will\nand if it's repeated over and over\nwhat's far harder for everybody to do\nand in fact what most people simply\ncannot do is Imagine long extended\nscenes and stories in their mind that go\non for minutes and minutes that involve\na lot of different sensory stimuli this\nis a really key point in fact as we\nstart to hone in on ideal mental\ntraining and visualization protocols I'd\nlike to establish this as the first\nprinciple of mental training and\nvisualization which is that if you are\ngoing to use Mental training and\nvisualization to its best effect in\norder to engage in neuroplasticity and\nlearning you need to keep those\nvisualizations quite brief really on the\norder of about 15 to 20 seconds or so\nand pretty darn sparse meaning not\nincluding a lot of elaborate\nvisualization not including a lot of\nsequences of motor steps what I mean are\nmotor sequences if you're trying to\nlearn something in terms of physical\nmovement\nor visual sequences or auditory\nsequences if you're trying to learn\nthings in terms of music or Dance Etc\nthat can be completed and repeated in 15\nseconds or less\nnow later I'll give you a couple of\nspecific examples but if you want to use\nMental training and visualization\nunderstand this is the key first\nprinciple they have to be very short\nvisualizations that you can repeat over\nand over and over again with a high\ndegree of accuracy so you don't want to\nembark on a mental training and\nvisualization Paradigm in which it\ninvolves a lot of elaborate stimuli and\nyou have to think really hard and work\nreally hard even if you're in that\ncategory of people who can do mental\nvisualization pretty naturally and\neasily now if you're somebody who can't\ndo mental visualization in fact if\nyou're somebody who has full-blown\naphantasia or the inability to mentally\nvisualize well then it's especially\nimportant that you make those mental\ntrainings and visualizations really\nbrief and very very simple I'd like to\ntake a quick break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors athletic greens athletic\ngreens now called ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that covers all\nof your foundational nutritional needs\nI've been taking athletic greens since\n2012 so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring podcast the reason I started\ntaking athletic greens and the reason I\nstill take athletic greens once are\nusually twice a day is that it gets to\nbe the probiotics that I need for gut\nhealth our gut is very important it's\npopulated by gut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain the immune\nsystem and basically all the biological\nsystems of our body to strongly impact\nour immediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 now in\norder to develop the best mental\ntraining and visualization protocols for\nyou let's go a little bit deeper into\nwhat the research says about mental\nvisualization now the classic work on\nmental visualization really hinges on a\nnumber of different researchers and\ntheir work but in particular Roger\nShepard who did this work at Stanford\nand Stephen coslin who's now at Harvard\nof course others in the field but it's\nreally the work of Shepherd the lay the\nfoundation for our understanding of what\nhappens in the brain when we mentally\nvisualize something\nShepard did these incredible experiments\nin which he had students mentally\nvisualize simple objects like a square\nlike a triangle and he measured how long\nit took them to do that now of course at\nthe time when he did these experiments\nthere were no sophisticated brain\nImaging devices and machines like fmri\nhowever everything I'm about to describe\nhas been later confirmed using things\nlike fmri what Shepard did and what he\nfound is that if people were told to\nvisualize very simple objects they did\nit pretty quickly however if they were\ntold to visualize more complex objects\nor importantly to rotate those objects\nin their Mind's Eye well then it took\nlonger for them to perform those mental\nvisualizations now many of you might\nthink duh if I have to just imagine a\ntriangle or a cube that's going to be\nvery easy and very fast whereas if I\nhave to rotate that triangular cube in\nmy mind's eye that's going to take more\ntime and indeed that is somewhat of a\nduh except and this is so very important\nexcept that what Shepard and his\ncolleagues found is that how long it\ntakes somebody to generate and rotate a\ngiven visual image\nscales directly with the complexity of\nthat image in fact causalin did some\nexperiments I think illustrate this even\nbetter and here's the experiment I love\nthis experiment I think you'll love it\ntoo because\nit illustrates something so\nfundamentally important about how our\nbrains work not just for sake of mental\ntraining and visualization which is how\nour brains work at all\nhe showed people a picture of a map so a\nmap drawn on a piece of paper\nthis was a map of an island\nit included things like a loading dock\nfor some boats it had a location for\ngetting food on the island at some trees\nadd some other small landmarks drawn out\nand people looked at this\nand memorized it or in other experiments\nthey just had people imagine this island\nand the location of these different\nlandmarks on the island so it didn't\nreally matter which but then he had\npeople imagine moving or walking from\none location on the island to another so\nthey'd say okay you're at the loading\ndock now move to the restaurant okay\nyou're at the restaurant now move to the\npalm tree you're on the North Shore of\nthe island now go around the side of the\nisland clockwise to arrive at the bay on\nthe southwest corner this sort of thing\nwhat causlin found was absolutely\nincredible what he found was that the\namount of time that it takes people to\nmove from one location on the map to\nanother\nscaled linearly directly with the actual\nphysical location between those objects\non the map so for those of you that can\nunderstand or into the importance of\nwhat Shepard and causlin showed great\nI'm guessing however that for most\npeople out there you're still grasping\nlike okay interesting you know how\nthings happen in the real world dictates\nhow they happen in our mind's eye but I\nwant to make sure that I really nail\nhome the importance of this for\neverybody\nthe importance of this is that when we\nlook at something in the real world so\nif I look at the pen in front of me I'm\nholding up my pen for those of you that\nare listening just holding up my pen in\nfront of me I move it to the right and\nback and forth what's happening is I'm\nactivating or I'm triggering the\nelectrical activity of neurons which we\ncan think of kind of as pixels in my eye\nokay so it's leftward to right word\nmotion for me and back and forth and\nthose are getting activated and they're\nsending signals up to my visual cortex\nand that information is processed at a\ngiven speed\nwhat the visualization experiments that\nShepard and koslin and others did show\nis that the processing speed of imagined\nexperiences is exactly the same as the\nprocessing speed of real experiences and\nthe spatial relationship between\nimagined and real experiences\nis exactly the same as well put simply\nwhen we imagine something in our mind's\neye or mind's ear\nwe are Imagining the real thing\nhappening and when I say the real thing\nit's not the obvious real thing of\ncourse if you're imagining something\nthat's the thing you're imagining what I\nmean is that your brain at the level of\nneurons is behaving exactly the same way\nand this needn't have been the case okay\nthere could have been a result for\ninstance that if people were asked to\nvisualize a cube and rotate it\nfrom you know flip it from top to bottom\nokay so put the top that's upward on a\ntable now down on the table and so forth\nor to migrate around the island you know\ncounterclockwise going from you know the\nnorthern coast all the way down to the\nsouthern coast clockwise and then back\nup to the northern coast that they could\nhave just done it really quickly like\nall in one second but that's not what\nhappens they always match the speed at\nwhich they do things in their Mind's Eye\nto the same speed that they do them in\nthe real world so in telling you this\nwhat I'm saying is that mental\nvisualization at the neural level is\nidentical to real world events so when\nyou've heard that when we imagine\nsomething it's identical in terms of our\nbrain's experience of it and our bodies\nexperience of it as when we actually\nexperience something that is true at the\nneural level however when it comes to\nlearning and improving performance in\nthe cognitive or physical domain they\nare not equivalent so this is the second\nprinciple of of mental training and\nvisualization as you recall the first\nprinciple of mental training and\nvisualization was that in order to make\nit effective it needs to be very brief\nand very simple and repeated over and\nover again the second principle of\nmental training and visualization is\nthat while yes mental training and\nvisualization recaptures the same\npatterns of neural firing in the exact\nsame ways as real world behavior and\nthinking\nit is not as effective as real world\nbehavior and thinking in other words if\nyou want to learn something the ideal\nsituation is to combine real training in\nthe physical world with mental training\nand I'll talk about exactly how to do\nthat and in what ratios a little bit\nlater now there's a really incredible\nset of experiments that illustrate why\nit is that mental training and\nvisualization can be extremely effective\nbut that it's always going to be most\neffective when combined with real world\ntraining and experiences the experiments\nthat I'm talking about involve the use\nof what are called bistable images or\nimpossible figures now some of you are\nprobably familiar with impossible\nfigures these are figures or objects\nthat when you look at them\nthey have these odd features like you're\nnot sure where they stop and where they\nstart where they end one good example\nwould be the so-called Mobius strip the\nMobius strip is literally a strip or a\nline that is contiguous it goes up and\nit loops around and then it curves\naround and then it goes back and and it\njust continues and continues and when\nyou look at it you can never really tell\nwhere it starts and where it stops\nbecause it doesn't have any of the\nfeatures that allow you to see what's\nthe front and what's the back in any\nkind of stable way another example of an\nimpossible figure would be you know a\nlittle set of Cubes that look like\nthey're coming out toward you maybe with\na little Bend in them going up at a\nright angle perhaps but then if you look\nat it a little bit longer that little\npiece that's facing up looks like it's\nin front and you can't really tell\nwhat's in front and what's in back and\nso it's called an impossible figure\nbecause you don't really know how to\nframe it in your mind to tell what's\ncloser to you and what's further apart\nbi-stable images are somewhat similar\nalthough different in the sense that\nthey typically are simple Silhouettes so\nfor instance the faces vases by stable\nimage is perhaps the most famous of\nthese where you look at this image it's\nvery simple and it looks like two vases\nbut then you look at it a little bit\nlonger and you realize that you're\nlooking at the side angle or the profile\nof two faces looking at one another and\nwhen you see those two faces looking at\none another you can't see the vases at\nthe same time but then if you decide to\nsee the vases again you can see the\nvases again but the faces disappear so\nit's bi-stable meaning that you can't\nsee the faces and bases at the same time\nand impossible figures and bi-stable\nimages\nare capturing the fact that your visual\ncortex and some of the associated areas\nthat compute visual scenes in your world\nare essentially trying to recreate\nwhatever it is that's out in front of\nthem and that's effectively what your\nvisual system does it's very good at\nrecreating visual images in your brain\nin your mind's eye because if you think\nabout it even with your eyes open your\nbrain is just creating an abstract\nrepresentation of what it thinks is out\nthere\nbut that when it comes to assigning an\nidentity to something like oh that's a\nface or oh that's a vase\nthat is constrained by different neural\ncircuits by different areas of the brain\nand somehow those circuits can't be\nco-active we cannot see the faces and\nthe vases at exactly the same time we\ncan switch back and forth really quickly\njust as we can switch back and forth\nreally quickly when we're looking at the\nimpossible figure and think okay that's\nthe front of it that's the back no wait\nthat's the back that's the front end\nit's going back and forth but we can't\nsee them both at the same time no one\ncan see them both at the same time\nokay we know this from brain Imaging\nstudies now impossible figures in\nbi-stable images can be seen right you\ncould look them up right now on your\nphone or computer\nor I could show you pictures of them on\npaper right in front of you and you can\ndo these sorts of perceptual experiments\nof telling people look at the face look\nat the vase look at the front of the\ncube and I'll make it at the back of the\ncube and they can do this somewhat\ndeliberately\nhowever and this is I think so very\ninteresting to understanding how mental\ntraining and visualization does and does\nnot support Real World Learning\nif you try to imagine a bi-stable image\nyou can't do it\nin fact no one can do it until they do\nsomething else okay so for those of you\nsaying wait I can do it I can do faces\nfaces in my mind's eye I promise you\nthat the neuroimaging\ndisputes your belief okay and supports\nthe idea that we can see real world by\nstable images we can see real world\nimpossible figures but when we try and\nimagine those in our Mind's Eye we\nsimply can't do it we can't do the\nperceptual shift in our Mind's Eye we\ncan't switch back and forth between\nfaces and vases however and I just have\nto chuckle because I think these\nexperiments are so clever if I have you\ntrace or Draw\nwith a pen\non a piece of paper an impossible figure\nor the faces vases by stable image and\nthen I ask you to imagine that bi-stable\nimage or impossible figure and to switch\nback and forth\nyou were able to do it so what that\nillustrates is that it's the combination\nof imagined and real world experiences\nreal motor movements real perceptual\nexperiences combined with motor\nmovements combined with what you imagine\nin your mind's eye that really gives you\nthe most depth and flexibility over your\nmental visualization\nand in doing so we can really stamp down\na third principle of mental training and\nvisualization which is that your mental\ntraining and visualization will be far\nmore effective if you are performing the\nexact same or very similar mental and\nphysical tasks in the real world okay so\nfirst principle is mental training and\nvisualization needs to be simple and\nbrief and repeated second is that mental\ntraining and visualization is not a\nreplacement for real world\nmotor training or cognitive training\nit's an augment it's an addition that\ncan really help and the third principle\nof mental training and visualization is\nthat you need to combine mental training\nand visualization with real world\nbehaviors and experiences that are very\nvery similar now as a brief but I think\nreally relevant aside\none of the things that also makes mental\ntraining and visualization more\neffective is when we assign cognitive\nlabels to what's going on when we\nvisualize so what I mean is that people\nare much better at manipulating faces\nand bases in their Mind's Eye of course\nonly once they've drawn them out\nphysically with their hand as I\nmentioned before then they are\nmanipulating abstract objects like\nimpossible figures\nin part because\nby labeling them faces and vases\npeople are able to capture a lot of\nother neural Machinery that's related to\nfaces and bases in fact we have entire\nbrain areas on both sides of the brain\ndevoted to the processing of faces\nthey're called fusiform face area\nwe have other areas in our brain that\nare involved in processing of 3D objects\nbut faces are of particular value\nthere's a there's a value to\nunderstanding what a face is as opposed\nto a non-face and there's a value to\nunderstanding what a particular face is\nin fact the simplest way to put this is\nthat the human brain is in many ways a\nface recognition and expression of faces\nrecognition machine it of course does\nother things but it is exceptionally\ngood at that unless you're in a\nprofession in which the relationships\nbetween 3D objects and your ability to\nmanipulate them is exceedingly important\nyou're not going to have a lot of neural\nreal estate specifically devoted to that\nsome people will be better at it some\npeople will be worse but when it comes\nto faces unless you have a condition\nlike prophetsagnosia which is an\ninability to recognize say famous faces\nand distinguish them from non-famous\nphases or if you have some sort of face\nrecognition deficit which about anywhere\nfrom one perhaps to three percent of\npeople out there have yeah they're just\nterrible recognizing faces and by the\nway there's about half a percent of\npeople out there that are what are\ncalled super recognizers that can\nrecognize faces in a large crowd they\ncan recognize specific faces even from\njust partial profiles by the way these\npeople are extremely valuable to\nsecurity agencies and security agencies\nare very good at finding these people\num machines are quickly getting\nbetter or at least as good as super\nrecognizers but the best super\nrecognizers are still better than the\nbest AI and machine algorithms out there\nbut the point is that in your mind's eye\nyou are better able to manipulate\nspecific objects or to see things more\nclearly and with more specificity when\nit has a label that you recognize from\nyour real world experience as opposed to\nabstract or fictional labels okay again\nstamping home the idea that what you\nexperience in the real world really\nserves to support your mental imagery\nand therefore the key importance of\nexperiencing and doing things in the\nreal world and supporting that with\nmental training and visualization and\nnot just relying on mental training and\nvisualization and the tangent here\nthat's a little bit of fun\nand I don't think we've ever talked\nabout before on this podcast is that of\nUFOs unidentified flying objects you\nknow there's a lot of people out there\nwho think that they've seen UFOs I guess\ntechnically they have because a UFOs and\nidentified flying object and if it's\nunidentified at least to them then it is\nindeed a UFO I guess the question is\nwhether or not uh or the dispute rather\nis whether or not those UFOs are\nactually flown by aliens or controlled\nby aliens I think that's where the\ndispute lies but you can imagine how if\nsomebody sees an object in their\nenvironment and decides Ah that's a UFO\nokay remember these faces faces or these\nimpossible figures if they say oh that\nthing is a UFO as opposed to something\nelse they see in other words the face\nnot the vase well that stamps it down as\na memory in their visual system and\nrelated systems and then in their Mind's\nEye they are seeing the UFO they're not\nseeing the other thing that it could\npossibly be okay so it's stamped down a\nvery specific memory so the point here\nis that mental training and\nvisualization relies on not just the\nphysical Contours and the exact spatial\nprofiles and the speed of movement of\nparticular things that we experience in\nthe real world it also heavily depends\non the cognitive labels and the\ndecisions we make about the things that\nwe see and this will become very\nimportant as we build up toward our\nfourth principle of mental training and\nvisualization which is that our\ncognitive labels that is what we decide\nis happening when we do mental training\nand visualization turns out to be very\nimportant now this is not simply to say\nthat you can decide okay I want to learn\nhow to play piano and so I'm going to\ntell myself that a particular chord I\nimagine in my mind's eye is identical to\nthe real world chord just because I\ndecide it is the brain doesn't work that\nway it's not possible to just lie to\nyourself and learn better as a\nconsequence of the lies you tell\nyourself however\nwhat this tells us is that it is very\nvery important that your mental training\nand visualization accurately\nrecapitulate the real world training\nthat you're doing so if we are going to\nstamp down a fourth principle of\neffective mental training and\nvisualization based on what we know from\nthe scientific literature\nis that your mental training and\nvisualization should assign labels to\nwhat you're doing that can be matched to\nreal world training and experiences now\nthese can be somewhat abstract so for\ninstance if you're trying to learn\na particular aspect of the golf swing\nokay so let's say that you're working on\nyour golf swing seems to be there are a\nlot of people out there working on their\ngolf swing and you're going to do some\nmental training and visualization in\norder to improve your golf swing we\nalready know again let's just March\nthrough them that your mental training\nand visualization needs to be brief and\nsimple it needs to be the same or in\nfact it will be we can say the same as\nyour real world golf swing in other\nwords it will take you exactly the same\namount of time to perform that golf\nswing in your mind's eye as it would in\nthe real world incredible right again\nsomething that maybe is taking a little\nbit of time to sink in but once it does\nyou're gonna be like wow the brain is\nreally an incredible machine\nand that third principle that you still\nhave to do golf swings in the real world\nin addition to the mental training of\ngolf swings and fourth that if you want\nthat mental training and visualization\nto really improve your golf swing you're\ngoing to have to name or apply an\nidentity to the specific golf swing or\naspect of the golf swing that you're\npracticing so this could be abstract you\ncould call it mental training and\nvisualization of golf swing 1A and you\ncan imagine your mind's eye you know the\nperfect golf swing over and over and\nover and over but then when you're in\nthe real world you're also going to have\nto call that\neither out loud or just to yourself golf\nswing 1A okay as opposed to a putt which\nmight be 1B so naming and giving an\nidentity\nto a real world skill and applying the\nsame name or identity to the mental\nversion of that the visualization of\nthat can enhance the mental training and\nvisualization in significant ways so\nwhen we apply identities or names to\nthese mental trainings and\nvisualizations and again provide that\nthey are brief and repeated and so on\nwe greatly enhance the amount of neural\nMachinery in the brain and body that we\nare able to recruit when we go to\nperform those\nreal world golf swings and golf putts\nand here just replace golf swing and\ngolf butt with anything that you're\ntrying to learn\nyou're able to recruit a lot more neural\nmachinery and greatly increase the\nprobability of proper execution so\nbefore we go any further I want to share\nwith you a couple of incredible aspects\nof mental visualization that really can\nbe harnessed and applied toward mental\ntraining and visualization some of these\nwere done by Roger Shepard and his\ngraduate students in postdocs some were\ndone by Steve costlin and by others what\nthese experiments really show is that\nmental training and visualization is\ncapturing many many of the exact same\nfeatures of real world behavior and\nperceptions not all of them but many of\nthem so for instance if I tell you to\nclose your eyes\nand imagine\na ceiling that has tiles that are black\nand white checkered tiles you know one\nblack tile one white tile for instance\nwe know based on experiments where we\nmeasure eye movements Behind Closed\neyelids is that people tend to move\ntheir eyes up when they are imagining\nthings above them such as the ceiling\nwhereas if I tell you to imagine things\ndown on the floor like you're taking a\nhike and you're looking for rattlesnakes\nactually just recently I experienced\nbecause it's spring here in California\nrattlesnake along a hiking trail it's\nreally quite beautiful although I have\nto confess I enjoyed keeping my distance\nI don't like snakes uh very much I don't\ndislike snakes but I prefer not to\ninteract with them unless I have to if I\nhave you imagine that rattlesnake\ndepending on your relationship or\nthoughts about rattlesnakes number of\nthings will happen in your brain of\ncourse activation in the limbic system\nor not for instance\nbut what I know is that regardless of\nhow you feel about snakes\nmost of you will move your eyes down\nwhen imagining a snake okay it might be\nsubtle it might be fast but\nstatistically that result shows up as\nopposed to when I imagine or I ask you\nto imagine something above you you tend\nto move your eyes up in addition to that\nif I tell you for instance to imagine an\nelephant and a mouse next to one another\nyou presumably have some real world\nunderstanding about the relative sizes\nof elephants versus mice elephants\ngenerally are bigger than mice thank\ngoodness\nmice are smaller than elephants if I ask\nyou to tell me about the details of that\nMouse's face so for instance can you see\nits whiskers\nthe processing time required for you to\ndo that is much longer than the\nprocessing time required if I say\ntell me what the position of that\nelephant's trunk is now why would that\nbe so okay the position of the\nelephant's trunk wasn't something that I\ntold you it wasn't dictated by me it's\nin your mind's eye maybe you don't even\nknow and you have to go searching for it\nbut what we do know is that if I tell\nyou to look at a small object in your\nmind's eye versus a larger object so for\ninstance the mouse versus the elephant\nit takes longer for you to do that in\nother words just as with the map\nexperiment the distance between things\non a map is conserved in your mind's eye\nas a linear relationship takes longer to\ngo far distances between things on a map\nin your mind\nthan it does to go shorter distances\nit's also the case that it takes you\nlonger to look at the details of a small\nobject versus a large object because why\nbecause you are zooming in in your\nmind's eye again all of which speaks to\nthe equivalence of mental imagery with\nreal world imagery and perception and as\nI mentioned earlier and as we'll see in\na moment this also extends into the\nmotor domain it takes you longer to\nperform Complex Motor sequences in your\nmind's eye than it does simple motor\nsequences just as it would in the real\nworld and if you're saying of course of\ncourse of course well then great then\nwe've really underscored the point which\nis that when you imagine things it is\nnot exactly the same but it is very very\nmuch the same as actually doing or\nperceiving those things in the real\nworld and the fifth principle of\neffective mental training and\nvisualization is this notion of\nequivalence of mental imagery versus\nReal World perception and behavior\nthese are the experiments as you recall\nwhere if people are told to look for\nclouds in their mental visualization\nthey tend to look up or if they're\nlooking for something on the floor they\ntend to look down even Behind Closed\neyelids now this can be applied toward\nbuilding an especially effective mental\ntraining and visualization protocol if\nyou deliberately move your eyes in the\ndirection of the thing or things that\nyou are trying to recapitulate in your\nmind in your visualization that is you\ndon't necessarily have to include this\nstep but mental training and\nvisualization is going to be more\neffective if you do because with\nconsciously generated eye movements\nagain even Behind Closed eyelids you are\nbringing about more of the neural\ncircuitry that one would experience if\nyou were to perform that particular\ncognitive task or motor task in the real\nworld which as I mentioned before in\nprinciple number three you need to be\ndoing anyway separately from your rental\ntraining and visualization so what we're\ntalking about here is thus far five\nprinciples of mental training and\nvisualization that are well established\nfrom the scientific research literature\nin fact I haven't mentioned this quite\nyet and I'll refer to some other\nreferences but there's a wonderful\nsystematic review of a large number of\nstudies that have looked at mental\ntraining and visualization what's\neffective what's less effective across a\nbunch of different disciplines that\ninclude education medicine music\npsychology and sports we will provide a\nlink to this paper in the show note\ncaptions but the title of the paper is\nbest practice for motor imagery a\nsystematic literature view on motor\nimagery training elements in five\ndifferent disciplines as the title\nsuggests it's mainly for\nmotor imagery training but it extends\ninto music which of course involves\nmotor training and execution but as well\nas education this review establishes a\nnumber of different important things I'm\ngoing to read off some of the key or\nhighlight takeaways for instance I\ndescribed principle one of effective\nmental training and visualization which\nis that the visualization be brief and\nit be simple and it be repeated you may\nask how many times that very brief 5 to\n15 second exercise of going through some\nroutine\nshould be repeated\nwell different Studies have used\ndifferent ranges of let's call them\nrepetitions in a given training session\nbut the number that seems to be most\neffective is somewhere between 50 and 75\nrepeats per session\nthat brings about the question of how\nlong one should rest between each repeat\nthis gets a little tricky depending on\nwhat you're trying to do remember that\nwe have this threshold of about 15\nseconds for completion of the entire\nmotor sequence let's say what you're\ntrying to do like a golf swing takes you\nfive seconds to imagine in your mind's\neye\nfrom the point where you let's just say\nhave the ball on the tee you bring the\nthe golf club up you might reposition\nyour your feet just a little bit you\nknow that kind of a little wiggle that\ngolf golfers do and then the swing if\nthat whole thing takes five seconds in\nyour mind's eye and roughly five seconds\nin the real world well then you'd be\nable to repeat it of course three times\nin 15 seconds that would be one\nrepetition even though you're doing it\nthree times so it's one 15 second Epoch\nas it's sometimes called Epoch Epoch and\nthen you would rest for an approximately\nequivalent amount of time 15 seconds or\nso and then repeat\nand the rest 15 seconds or so and then\nrepeat\nrest 15 seconds and then repeat again\nthree golf swings within that 15 seconds\nrest 15 seconds three golf swings within\nthat 15 seconds rest 15 seconds truth\ntold these epochs and these rest periods\ndo not need to be exact you could\nimagine for instance that you get three\nrepetitions of the Swing within 14\nseconds well then do you do another one\nor do you wait until the end of that 15\nseconds I encourage you not to obsess\ntoo much about those sorts of points\nrather you want to do as many repeats as\nyou can in about a 15 second\nEpoch and then rest for about 15 seconds\nand then repeat for a total of 50 to 75\nrepetitions which might not sound like a\nlot to some of you might sound like an\nawful lot to others of you to me it\nsounds like a lot you know 50\nrepetitions of something and where\nyou're trying to concentrate in your\nmind's eye on getting something\naccomplished over and over over again in\nexactly the same way might seem like a\nlot we know based on the learning\nliterature that your ability to\nsuccessfully perform something in the\nreal world will lend itself to better\nperformance of that thing in the\nimagined world within your mind's eye\nthat's also one of these sort of does\nbut if you're trying to get better at\nsomething that you've never performed\nbefore you really should know that the\nmental training visualization is\nprobably not the best augment\nto that real world training until you're\nable to perform it successfully in the\nreal world at least some of the time\nmental training and visualization can be\neffective however at increasing the\naccuracy or the frequency at which you\ncan do that real world Behavior\nso if normally you're only getting the\ncorrect swing or you're only hitting the\nthe golf ball correctly\nsay 10 of the time mental training and\nvisualization can really help bring that\nnumber up but it is important that you\nare able to successfully complete that\nmotor task in the real world similarly\nfor performance of cognitive tasks so\nsay for instance um speaking a new\nlanguage you might ask well gosh what\nwhat in the landscape of speaking a new\nlanguage can be restricted to 5 to 15\nseconds where I could repeat it anywhere\nfrom you know through one to three times\nin a given Epoch and then rest and then\nkeep repeating 50 to 75 times Well there\nI would encourage you to pick something\nthat you are able to do perhaps very\nslowly so to speak a particular sentence\nbut with some challenge in getting the\naccent and the enunciation right but\nyou've completed it successfully before\nand you want to get more smooth or more\nfluid with it likewise for you know\nplaying piano or guitar again you have\nto translate to the specific cognitive\nand or motor activity that you are\nseeking to improve at but\nthose epochs lasting 5 to 15 seconds are\nreally the Cornerstone of an effective\nmental training and visualization\npractice and the repeated nature of it\n50 to 75 repetitions in a given session\nis also another Cornerstone of an\neffective mental training and\nvisualization practice so says this\nreview and some of the other papers that\nI'm going to get to in a few moments\nnow one of the other key components of a\nsuccessful mental training and\nvisualization practice is how often you\nperform that mental training and\nvisualization practice and again a\nnumber of different Studies have looked\nat this through a number of different\nlenses meaning anywhere from two to\neight times per week\nit does appear that performing these\nsessions anywhere from three to five\ntimes per week is going to be effective\nwe could perhaps even say most effective\nbecause most of the uh let's just call\nit the strongest data really point to\nrepeating these 50 to 75 Trials of the\nsame thing three to five times per week\nso you can come up with a number that's\nreasonable for you to do consistently\nand you might ask do you have to\ncontinue to perform the mental training\nand visualization forever and the good\nnews is the answer to that question is\nno it does seem that once you have\nwhat's called Consolidated the Motor\nPerformance or the cognitive performance\nof something it can be further supported\nor reinforced that is Consolidated in\nthe neural circuits that are responsible\nfor performing that mental or physical\ntask so in other words once you are\nperforming that cognitive or motor task\nin a way that's satisfactory or perhaps\njust improved perhaps you're not a\nhundred percent but it's improved in the\nreal world you don't need to continue to\ndo mental training and visualization to\nto maintain that real world performance\nso that's a good thing in fact\nthe ideal situation would be then to\npick a different sequence or thing that\nyou're trying to learn and do mental\ntraining and visualization for that I\nperhaps might have misspoke there\nalthough I don't want to edit this out I\nmisspoke in the sense that again I said\nfor the thing that you're trying to\nlearn remember mental training and\nvisualization is going to be most\neffective for building up the number of\naccurate trials or that your ability to\ndo something with a greater frequency of\nsomething that you're already\ncapable of doing or have done at least\nonce in the real world okay this is not\nto say that mental training and\nvisualization can't be used to acquire\nnew skills it can in principle but it\nhas been shown to be most effective for\nenhancing the speed and the accuracy of\nskills that one has already demonstrated\nsome degree of proficiency at in the\nreal world I think that's important to\npoint out because we often hear mental\ntraining visualization and this\nequivalence of perceptual and motor\nexperiences in our Mind's Eye to the\nreal world and we think oh all we have\nto do is Imagine doing something and we\nwill get better at it and unfortunately\nthat's not the case the good news is\nhowever if you can do something once\neven very slowly in the real world and\nthen you bring it to the mental imagery\nand visualization domain you can get\nmuch faster at it in a way that really\ndoes translate back to the real world\nI'd like to just take a

any of inside\ntrackers plans again that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off now\nif you recall principle number three or\nwhat I'm calling principle number three\nof effective mental training and\nvisualization which was that you have to\nbe able to perform\nthe thing that you're trying to get\nbetter at through visualization and\nimagery in the real world\nthat should raise the question of what\nis the ratio of real world training\nversus mental training that's going to\nbe most effective well here there's some\nreally interesting data not just in the\nreview that I mentioned but in a couple\nof the other papers that we're going to\ntalk about in a few minutes but what\nI've done is I've synthesized the\ninformation across those papers and they\nreally all point to the fact that\nreal world training is more effective\nthan mental training and mental training\nis more effective than no training now\nthe mental training more effective than\nno training is kind of a duh except that\nthere are people for instance people who\nare injured\nwho are trying to maintain or replenish\nsome motor skill or ability to move in a\nparticular way or who have had traumatic\nbrain injury and are trying to recreate\nexperiences in a way that's safe for\nthem while in a somewhat restricted\nformat so for instance if you've damaged\na limb or you're experiencing chronic\npain and you need to take a layoff from\nsome physical activity there are now\nmany studies looking at stroke patients\nat patients that have been in accidents\nTBI also people who are suffering from\nmore conventional limb and connective\ntissue injuries that if they do mental\ntraining it obviously is not going to\nput them at risk of doing those same\nmovements\nas it would in the real world right but\nthat it can actually accelerate or at\nleast maintain skill performance so this\nis pretty exciting if you think about it\nwhat this means and the reason it\nunderscores this mental training is\nbetter than no training is that should\nyou find yourself in the unfortunate\ncircumstance of being injured or unable\nto perform a given Behavior Imagining\nthe sequence of behavior that you'd like\nto maintain or even build up over time\nprovided you've done that motor sequence\nbefore in the real world well the mental\ntraining and visualization can really\nhelp keep that online or even help you\nimprove over time in fact I have a\ncolleague in the psychology department\nat Stanford who told me an anecdote and\nadmittedly it's just an anecdote of a\nstudent who was recruited to Stanford\nboth for their academic prowess but also\nfor their abilities in tennis and was\ninjured in their first year and at first\nthought this was devastating but did a\ncognitive reframe around the idea that\nthat let's call it extended layoff from\nactual tennis was going to afford them\nthe ability to do more mental training\nthan they would otherwise even though\nthey were quite sad to not be able to do\nactual physical training for tennis and\nwhen they came back from that injury\nthey did indeed manage to improve beyond\nthe initial non-injured state that we're\nin before the injury which is pretty\nremarkable but\nas Kelly pointed out to me they were\nvery careful to include a lot of mental\ntraining and visualization during that\nquote-unquote layoff period so again\nmental training better than no training\nphysical training better than mental\ntraining\nbut when we say physical training better\nthan mental training what we're really\ntalking about is when you allocate a\ncertain amount of training hours for a\ngiven skill per week okay so how would\nthis look what these Studies have done\nis they've said okay if people have the\noption of doing the real world training\nfor 10 hours a week versus mental\ntraining for 10 hours a week\nwhich group performs better it turns out\nit's the ones that do the physical\ntraining for 10 hours per week however\nwe also know that combinations of\nphysical training and mental training\ncan bring about results that are greater\nthan either one of those alone\nhow would that work well I wish I could\ntell you that if you did nine hours of\nphysical training per week plus one hour\nof mental training\nthat your performance would be better\nthan if you did 10 hours of physical\ntraining and that's not the case\nokay this is why we can reliably say\nphysical Real World Training\nand again this could be in the cognitive\ndomain is always going to be more\neffective on an hour by hour basis\ncompared to mental training so if you\ncan do real world training and perhaps\nwe should be calling it real world as\nopposed to physical but\nif you can do real world training\ncompared to purely mental training\nthat's going to be the best use of your\ntime this is really important it doesn't\nunderscore everything that we're talking\nabout because\nhere's the really cool thing if you do\n10 hours per week of real world physical\ntraining again could be running could be\nmusic could be math could be whatever it\nis you're trying to learn shooting\nbasketball's hitting golf balls and you\nadd\none hour or even half an hour of mental\ntraining to that real world training\nwell then the results are significantly\ngreater than you would experience with\nphysical training alone and of course\nthat would be greater than you could\nachieve with mental training alone\nbecause we already established that real\nworld training is more powerful in\nlearning skills and retaining skills\nthan is mental training okay if any of\nthat was confusing let me just say it\none more time just to be ultra clear\nif you have the option to do real world\ntraining for a cognitive indoor motor\nskill versus mental training always go\nwith real world training however if you\ncan add to a maximum amount of real\nworld training\nby doing some mental training and you\nfollow the principles that we've been\ndiscussing here which are gleaned from\nthe scientific literature\nwell then you are going to get\nsignificantly greater results in terms\nof speed accuracy and consistency of\nperformance of those real world\nbehaviors and cognitive abilities\nand of course if you are unable to do\nphysical training for whatever reason\ninjury\ntravel whatever the case may be well\nthen doing mental training is still\nfour significantly greater than doing no\ntraining at all okay so total layoffs it\nturns out are a bad thing if you want to\nget better at something and indeed if\nyou want to retain certain skills both\ncognitive and motor now a couple of\nother things to keep in mind as you're\nthinking about how to build up skills\nthrough a combination of physical and\nmental training\nwell remember back to the beginning of\nthe episode where we talked about\nneuroplasticity and the fact that\nself-directed adaptive plasticity which\nis really what we're talking about here\nin this entire episode things that\nyou're trying to learn in a deliberate\nway that is as you recall a two-part\nprocess requires focused attention both\nwhen you're doing it in the real world\nand when you're doing mental training\nand it requires rest and sleep and in\nfact\nyou would be very wise to try and get a\ngood night's sleep both on the days when\nyou do physical training again also\ncalled real world training and mental\ntraining you may also be asking can you\ndo them on the same day and this gets\ninto some Nuance in the literature but\nby my read of the literature\nhere's the takeaway if you are doing the\nmaximum amount of physical training that\nyou can do according to your schedule\npreventing injury and all those sorts of\nimportant constraints and you're going\nto add mental training and imagery it\ndoesn't really matter when you do it you\ncould do it immediately after your\nphysical training you could do it on a\nseparate day but you do want to place it\nat a time in which you can try and get\ngood sleep that night so for instance\nBelieve It or Not Studies have been done\nwhere people are doing mental training\nat times when they should be sleeping\nthat is going to offset some of the\ndegradation and performance that you\nwould normally see but it's generally a\nbad idea you should do your real world\ntraining and your mental training\nwhenever it is that you can and then you\nshould try and get as much quality sleep\nas you possibly can on the night\nfollowing that physical and or mental\ntraining okay this is true of pretty\nmuch every night of your life right if I\nhad my way that is if I had a magic wand\nwhich obviously I don't I would ensure\nthat I and everyone else in the world\nget sufficient amounts of quality sleep\nevery single night but that's just not\nrealistic there are going to be times\nwhere that's simply not going to happen\nfor whatever reason and I always say if\nyou're not going to get sufficient\namounts of quality sleep for whatever\nreason trying to make it for a fund\nreason or a good reason but I think\ngetting sufficient amounts of quality\nsleep 80 percent of the nights of your\nlife\nis a reasonable goal and one that's\nworth driving toward and we have lots of\nepisodes now or three really on\nmastering sleep on perfecting your sleep\nand uh episode guest episode with the\ngreat Matthew Walker who wrote the book\nwhy you why we sleep\nincredibly important book all of those\nas well as our toolkit for Sleep\ndescribe ways to improve your sleep so\nyou can refer to those episodes if\nyou're having challenges with sleep and\nwant to improve on sleep\nand things like non-sleep depressed\nwhich can support your ability of sleep\nand your ability to learn so sleep is\nstill vitally important not just for\nensuring neuroplasticity occurs\nfollowing real world training but also\nfollowing mental training and again when\nyou place that mental training is not so\ncritical or at least it doesn't appear\nto be based on the literature so if\nanyone out there has knowledge of any\npeer-reviewed studies stating that\nmental training should be done either\nbefore or after or some hours away from\nReal World Training please send that to\nme or put in the excuse me put it in the\ncomments on YouTube and I'll see it\nthere because I do read all the comments\nbut I'm not aware of any any such data\nor analysis and by the way if you are\ninterested in understanding the\nrelationship between motor skill\nacquisition and retention and this first\nnight phenomenon of sleep the first\nnight after training versus sleep on the\nsecond eye Etc there's a really\nwonderful paper that was published by\nnone other than the great Matthew Walker\nwhen I believe he was a graduate student\nmaybe he was a postdoc when he did this\nin Robert's stick Gold's Lab at Harvard\nthe title of the paper is sleep and time\ncourse of motor skill learning this is a\npaper published in 2003 still an\nincredibly important paper I will\nprovide a link to it in the show note\ncaptions it really highlights some of\nthe key aspects of when people sleep and\nhow critical sleep is on the night\nfollowing and the nights following that\ntraining in order to really consolidate\ncertain types of learning and what\nphases of sleep relate to the\nconsolidation of motor learning Etc a\nreally wonderful paper and of course but\njust one of Matthew and Robert stick\nGold's incredible papers on sleep and\nlearning remember at the beginning of\nthe episode when I mentioned that many\npeople are good at mental training and\nvisualization but some people are not\nwell sex differences have been explored\nand age-related differences have been\nexplored in terms of people's ability to\nmentally visualize and train up specific\nskills and while initially there were\nsome sex differences identified really\nthe bulk of the subsequent literature\nthat is the majority of quality\npeer-reviewed studies on this aspect of\nmental training visualization point to\nthe fact that there are no significant\ndifferences between males and females in\nterms of their ability to mentally\nvisualize nor their ability to use that\nmental visualization toward improving\ncognitive or motor skills that point was\ncovered in some detail in the review I\nmentioned earlier best practice for\nmotor imagery a systematic literature\nview on motor imagery training elements\nin five different disciplines this\nreview also looked at age-related\neffects and perhaps the only thing that\nreally popped out from this literature\nreview in terms of age-dependent\ndifferences that point to changes in\nprotocols that you might make is that\nfor individuals 65 or older a\ncombination of physical and mental\ntraining may actually allow them\nto gain and consolidate skills better\nthan were they to do physical training\nalone now whether or not that's due to\nsome\nlower upper limit of physical training\nthat they can do because of their age or\nwhether or not that's something specific\nto do with older versus younger neural\ncircuits isn't clear\nbut what this review also makes clear is\nthat for the vast majority of people out\nthere so teens people in their 20s\nin their 40s and so on physical training\nmore effective than mental training we\nsaid that before combination of physical\nand mental training more effective\nthan physical training alone provided\nthe mental training is on top of the\nmaximum amount of physical training that\none could do and of course mental\ntraining more effective than no training\nat all okay so we talked about sets and\nReps we talked about you know five to\nFifteen second epochs with about 15\nsecond breaks in between\nor rest between sets if you will repeat\nit for 50 to 75 trials done three to\nfive times per week\nsome of the conditions of keeping it\nreally simple The Importance of Being\nable to actually perform those sequences\nin the real world and so on what we\nhaven't discussed is first person versus\nthird person and eyes open versus eyes\nclosed so what are we really talking\nabout here well first person mental\ntraining and visualization would be\nwhere you are imagining doing something\nand you are seeing yourself doing\nsomething from the inside out as opposed\nfrom the outside in Imagine for instance\nwearing a headcam okay or a body Cam and\ndoing something with your hands\nor being in virtual reality and having\nthe sense that whatever you see in front\nof you and that's moving and that you're\ndoing that's you so what I mean by this\nis a mental training or visualization\nprotocol for instance if you were at the\npiano or at a guitar where you're\nactually looking down at or sensing the\nfeeling of your hands but you're not\nactually moving your hands okay as\nopposed to seeing yourself from outside\nof your body so looking at yourself say\nstanding next to you or from across the\nroom you're looking at yourself playing\nthe piano or playing guitar or swinging\na golf club or doing a tennis serve okay\nfirst person versus third person\nand what the data tell us is that first\nperson mental training and visualization\nis generally more effective than third\nperson mental training and visualization\nwhich perhaps raises another course of\ndoes out there but it needn't have been\nthe case right I mean you could imagine\nthat seeing yourself doing something and\ndoing it perfectly because you've done\nit perfectly once before hopefully would\nallow you to build up that skill more\nquickly because you have that third\nperson perspective where you can really\nsee every aspect in every element of\nwhat you're trying to perform\nWell turns out that the first person\nmental training and visualization is\nsignificantly more effective than that\nthird person mental training and\nvisualization so if what you're trying\nto learn lends itself well to this first\nperson mental experiencing of self as\nyou perform the cognitive and or motor\nskill I suggest you do that as opposed\nto the third person version\nnow what if what you're trying to learn\ndoesn't lend itself well to first person\nvisualization for instance what if\nyou're trying to learn uh specific\ncognitive skill that doesn't involve any\novert motor Behavior to be observed well\nin that case it's very clear that\nclosing your eyes ideally and trying to\nperform that specific cognitive task or\nthe statement or the you know uttering\nof a particular sentence in another\nlanguage or doing some sort of\ncomputation or problem solving of some\nsort in your head well that itself of\ncourse is first person because it's\ninside your own body as opposed to and I\ndon't know that anyone would actually do\nthis but looking at yourself from a\nthird person perspective in your mind's\neye and seeing yourself perform that\ncognitive\nchallenge whatever that challenge may\nhappen to be okay now we have to address\neyes open versus eyes closed and this is\nwhere the literature gets pretty\ninteresting I always thought for some\nreason I don't know why but I presumed\nthat mental training and visualization\nshould always be done eyes closed but it\nturns out that's not how a lot of\nstudies of mental training and\nvisualization have been done in fact\nmany of them have arrived at really\nimpressive protocols which are\nessentially the protocols that I've\ndistilled out and I'm listing out during\ntoday's episode\nhaving people either watch videos of\nthemselves performing a given skill and\nimagining themselves in that role and\nagain it's them so again during the\nmental training visualization they're\nwatching a movie of themselves so\nthey're somewhat in the third person\nperspective I guess we could technically\nsay they are in the third person\nperspective but they're watching\nthemself so in doing that we know based\non neuroimaging studies that when we\nwatch videos of ourselves doing things\nwe experience that more from a\nfirst-person perspective than if we\nwatch videos of other people doing\nthings use your imagination here folks\nso\nif you're somebody for instance who's\ntrying to get better at a particular\nskill this could be not just sport but\nalso public speaking watching videos of\nyourself doing that can be very\neffective but of course we have to come\nback to the first principle of effective\nmental training and visualization which\nis that whatever it is that we're trying\nto build up or consolidate as a skill\nneeds to be brief and repeated so what\nwe're really talking about here is\nwatching a video of ourselves on Loop or\nlistening to a audio or audio video\nrecording of ourselves on Loop for\nwhatever aspect that we're trying to\nbuild up or improve upon now for people\nthat for instance are trying to get\nbetter at dealing with public speaking\nand there isn't a particular skill or\nutterance of particular sentences or\nwords that they're trying to accomplish\nbut rather they're trying to learn to be\nmore relaxed or to articulate better in\nthe public speaking scenario there would\nbe one of the few instances in which I\nsuggest more General theme and not exact\nrecapitulation of some specific words\nthat you're going to say perhaps it\ncould be a sequence of you walking out\nonto stage\ntoward the podium or out from the podium\nand facing the audience and looking in\nmultiple directions up and down to see\npeople in every corner of the room and\njust repeating that on Loop in your\nmind's eye or watching yourself do that\non video and making yourself calm in\nyour internal State as you're doing that\nthis is more of mental autonomic\ntraining because what you're really\ntrying to do is control your autonomic\nnervous system the nervous system aspect\nthat controls how alert or calm you are\nas opposed to a specific skill however\nyou could also translate this to you\nknow dance steps or to motor sequences\nfor playing an instrument\nand so on so the point here is that it's\nnot as if there is zero utility to third\nperson mental training and visualization\nthere can be but\nfirst person mental training\nvisualization is going to be more\neffective as I mentioned before and if\nyou're going to use the third person\nmental training visualization ideally\nyou would be looking at yourself either\non video or listening to yourself in\naudio and or video\nthat is going to be more effective than\nclosing your eyes and trying to imagine\nyourself from a third person perspective\nin your mind's eye okay so just to make\nit really simple first person better\nthan third person visualization if\nyou're going to go with third person\nvisualization try and go with real third\nperson visualization where you're\nactually seeing and or hearing yourself\non a screen and again this was somewhat\nof a surprise to me I always thought\nthat mental training and visualization\nwas done with eyes closed I thought okay\ncould you close your eyes you imagine\nthis you imagine that that's actually\nnot the case for many many studies some\nof which are considered real Hallmark\nstudies within the field of mental\ntraining and visualization and the\ndifferent neural circuits that it\nrecruits and along those lines there's a\nreally interesting study it came out not\nthat long ago this was just a summer of\n2022. like to discuss in a little bit of\ndetail because it really hammers home a\nnumber of the principles that we talked\nabout the title of the article is mental\npractice modulates functional\nconnectivity between the cerebellum and\nthe primary motor cortex\nI'm going to tell you the essential\nfeatures of this study first of all\nprimary motor cortex\nsometimes called M1 is a relatively\nsmall but vitally important strip of\nneurons in or near the front of your\nbrain\nthe neurons there are called upper motor\nneurons they communicate through a set\nof neural connections with what are\ncalled lower motor neurons the lower\nmotor neurons sit in What's called the\nventral Horn of the spinal cord so along\nthe spinal cord you have sensory inputs\ncoming from skin and muscle and what's\ncalled proprioceptive feedback that\ntells you where your limbs are in\nrelation to each other and to yourself\nand so on you also have motor neurons\nthat live in the spinal cord they're\nactually the ones that send little wires\nthat we call axons out to the muscles\nrelease acetylcholine onto those muscles\nand allow those muscles to contract\nlower motor neurons are the ones that\nactually generate movement however\nthey are largely responsible for\nreflexive movements are already learned\nmovements and they require some input\nfrom things like Central pattern\ngenerators and some other circuits\nwithin the spinal cord and brain stem\nbut it's those M1 primary motor cortex\nneurons that are called upper motor\nneurons because they control lower motor\nneurons\nthrough directed action okay\nso when I say primary motor cortex I'm\nreally talking about those upper motor\nneurons M1 the cerebellum is an area in\nthe back of your brain if you were to\nlook at a brain you'd see two little\nlobes back there that are highly\nfoliated foliated means that lots of\nlots of folds and lots of bumps and\ngrooves back there and actually means\nmini brain it looks like a kind of a\nmini brain stuffed in the back of the\nbrain\nin certain animals the cerebellum is\nmuch larger than the rest of the brain\nin humans the cerebellum is relatively\nsmall compared to the rest of the\nso-called neocortex the outer shell the\nhuman brain the cerebellum is involved\nin Balance it's also involved in eye\nmovements it's also involved in timing\nand motor learning and the key thing to\nunderstand is that the cerebellum\ncommunicates with the primary motor\ncortex and it can do so through what's\ncalled inhibition it has outputs that\ninhibit the activity of neurons in the\nmotor cortex and elsewhere and that has\na profound influence on the execution of\nmotor Behavior and the learning of\nparticular motor behaviors now I don't\nwant to get into too much detail around\nall this but what you need to know is\nthat the cerebellum communicates with M1\nprimary motor cortex M1 is primary motor\ncortex so the upper motor neurons that\nare going to control that lower murder\nneurons and are going to control\nphysical behavior and execution of\nphysical movements\nthe communication between cerebellum and\nprimary motor cortex\nis inhibitory although it can activate\nmotor cortex too and this gets into a\nlittle bit of technical detail but there\ncan be inhibition of inhibition so if\nyou take something that's a break and\nyou inhibit that break what you end up\nwith is more excitation okay so the\ntakeaway here that's key and everyone\nshould be able to understand even though\nyou may or may not be following this\nwhole cerebellum primary motor cortex\nthing is that when we gain a new skill\nor we get more proficient at a skill so\nfaster and more accurate there tends to\nbe more net excitation of the cerebellum\nto motor cortex communication and that\nis accomplished by reducing inhibition\nso that's where it gets a little bit\nconfusing to some but in this paper what\nthey did is they explored people's\nability to improve on a very specific\nbut very simple motor sequence it's one\nthat you're already familiar with it's\nthat tapping sequence that I talked\nabout before where the thumb is digit\none index finger number two middle\nfinger number three\nring finger number four and pinky finger\nnumber five and it's a one two one three\none four one five one two one three one\nfour one five and they had people\nactually perform this and they measured\ntheir speed and accuracy and then they\nhad them do a practice session that was\neither an intentional task so one group\njust looked at an intentional cue and\nhad to maintain uh focus on that\nattentional cue and another group did\nmental practice they basically did 50\nimagined trials so just in their Mind's\nEye of this one two one three one four\none five on repeat okay 50 trials much\nin the same way as what I referenced as\nthe ideal protocol earlier okay 50\nrounds of that then they got tested\nagain on the motor task in the real\nworld\nand there were also recordings of the\ncerebellar to primary motor cortex\ncommunication so there were a bunch of\ndifferent results in this study I think\nare interesting but the ones that are\nmost important are that quote we found\nthat mental practice enhanced both the\nspeed and accuracy of this one two one\nthree one four one five performance in\nthe real world when people did these 50\nimagine trials there are many results\nout there different papers that\nparallel and essentially say the same\nthing as what is said in this paper and\nremember there have been studies of\nmental training dating back to the 1880s\nbut what this paper really does it looks\nat the neural machinery and the changes\nin the neural machinery and what they\nfound using transcranial magnetic\nstimulation both in the context of\nstimulating but also recording activity\nand connectivity between cerebellum and\nprimary motor cortex is that mental\ntraining enhanced the net excitation of\ncerebellum to motor cortex communication\nthat is it reduced the inhibition in a\nway that allowed motor cortex to\ngenerate these movements with more\naccuracy and more speed what's also\ninteresting about this paper is that it\nshowed that the Improvement in\nperformance of this task was not related\nto activation of the motor pathways\nthemselves so it's not the case that the\ncerebellum activation or inhibition\nchanged the patterns of excitation going\ndirectly to the spinal cord\nbecause those Pathways actually exist\nthrough a couple of intermediate\nstations what it really showed is that\nwhen people do mental training and here\nyou could say Okay 50 trials that's a\nlot of Trials but it's not actually that\nmany trials it's pretty fast learning if\nyou think about do a task in the real\nworld do 50 Trials of the Imagine task\ndo the trial in the real world again\nsignificant Improvement in speed and\naccuracy through now what are becoming\nto be established neural circuit\nconnections between cerebellum and\nprimary motor cortex okay so this study\nis one of several but not a tremendous\nnumber of studies out there that are\nstarting to really pinpoint the\nunderlying neural circuits that allow\nmental training and visualization to\nreally improve motor skill performance\nbut again and please hear me on this\nin this study and in the vast majority\nof other studies that have shown\nsignificant Improvement in Motor\nPerformance in the real world by use of\nmental training visualization there was\nan ability of each and everyone in the\nstudy to perform the specific motor\nsequence in the real world that then\nthey were able to enhance with mental\ntraining and visualization now thus far\nwe've been talking mostly about\nperformance of motor sequences and one\nof the things to really understand about\nperformance of motor sequences both in\nthe real world and in the Imagine\ncontext is that it involves the doing\nthat's what we call a go\naction and not doing certain things what\nI mean by not doing well for many tasks\nout there even ones as simple as the one\ntwo one three one four one five task\nthat we talked about a moment ago\nthere is the need not just to tap those\nfingers in the correct sequence as\nquickly as possible but also to be\naccurate about it to not do one three\none four or one three and four at the\nsame time so there's both a go component\nan action component and a withhold\naction component and the ability to\nwithhold action is strongly constrained\nby the time domain in other words the\nfaster that we need to perform a given\nmotor sequence the more likely we are to\nperform incorrect components of the\nmotor sequence as well okay so one of\nthe key things about mental training and\nvisualization that's really remarkable\nis that it can also be used and has been\nshown to improve not just go aspects of\nMotor Performance and cognitive\nperformance but also no go\naspects of Motor Performance and skill\nlearning now the go no go thing is\nsomething I've discussed before on this\npodcast in reference to the so-called\nbasal ganglia basal ganglia are\nsubcortical so they're below that bumpy\nsurface of the human brain that we're\nmost accustomed to seeing when we look\nat it from the outside\nand the basal ganglia are strongly\ninvolved in Go versus no go type tasks\nand learning now\nthere are only a few studies that have\nreally looked at the learning and the\nImprovement of no go components of motor\nlearning but these no-go components are\nreally really important in fact if we\nwere to look at what's involved at\nImprovement in a golf swing or shooting\nfree throws or getting better at piano\nor getting better at math or language\nspeaking\nI think it's fair to say that at least\nhalf and probably as much as 75 percent\nof motor learning is about restricting\ninappropriate movements or utterances or\nthoughts if what you're trying to learn\nis purely cognitive okay I think that's\nan important point that brings us back\nto our initial learning when we come\ninto this world that developmental\nplasticity which as you recall we have a\nlot of interconnected aspects of our\nbrain and nervous system early in life\nremember the example of the kid trying\nto eat and getting the spoon of food and\nBowl on their head Etc\nand then over time getting more accurate\nat bringing food to their mouth and\neating in a clean way things that most\nbut not all people accomplish in at some\npoint in the course of their lifetime\nwell there haven't been many but there\nhave been a few very interesting studies\nlooking at how mental training and\nvisualization can improve the no-go\naspect of motor learning and I think\nthis is important to highlight because\nit really mirrors What's Done in the\nreal world as opposed to just the finger\ntapping type things which are mostly go\ntasks again there's a little bit of a\nno-go component there but there are\nspecific tasks that people have\ndeveloped for the laboratory that really\nclosely mimic action learning and\ncognitive learning in the real world and\none of the more\nimportant of those is What's called the\nstop signal task now the stop signal\ntask is something that I'll explain to\nyou I'll also provide a link in the show\nnote caption so you can try it it's\nactually a lot of fun to try this\nbecause it really gives you a sense of\njust how challenging some of these\nlaboratory tasks are let me just\ndescribe it for a moment the stop signal\ntask was really developed and\npopularized by Gordon Logan and William\nCowan Gordon Logan is at Vanderbilt\nUniversity and has done a lot of really\nimportant work but one of the important\naspects of his work is looking at Motor\nPerformance and skill acquisition and\nthe development of the stop signal task\nI'll describe the stop signal task for\nyou now in Broad Contour you or another\nresearch subject would sit in front of a\nscreen there are two keys on that\nkeyboard or two keys among the other\nkeys on that keyboard one which is\ndesignated left the other which is\ndesignated right and then on the screen\nyou'll be presented for instance with a\nleft-facing or a right-facing arrow so\nin the initial trial what would happen\nis that Arrow would pop up on the screen\nand your job is to press the left key\nwhen the right facing arrow is presented\nyou press the right key okay pretty\nstraightforward but there's a limited\namount of time in which you can do this\nand the idea is that you're going to\nneed to do this within approximately 500\nmilliseconds of the presentation of that\nArrow or else it's going to tell you\nthat you missed that trial now of course\nif you press the wrong key so if the\narrow goes left and you press the right\nkey then you would be told you got that\none wrong okay so this is a reaction\ntime test and not one that's\nparticularly novel what's novel and what\nLogan and Cowan developed was that in\nthe stop signal task\nevery once in a while not every trial\nbut every once in a while that arrow is\npresented and then with some delay\nranging from anywhere from 100\nmilliseconds to maybe 350 milliseconds\nthere will be a red circle or a red X\nalso presented which is a stop signal\nand your job is to not press the key\nthat corresponds to the direction of\narrow in fact not press any key at all\nnow you can imagine how if the stop\nsignal shows up with a longer delay\nafter the presentation of the arrow\nthere's a higher probability that you\nwill have already generated the key\npressing movement okay so at the link\nthat we provide in the show note caption\nyou can actually do these two tasks and\nwhat you'll find is that you and most\npeople will be able to do this Arrow to\nReaction Time pressing of the left to\nright key somewhere in the neighborhood\nbetween 300 milliseconds and maybe as\nlong as 500 millisecond delay you'll get\nan average of how quickly you respond\nand then of course if you choose to and\nI would hope you would choose to go on\nand do the stop signal task\nyou will be told trial by trial whether\nor not you are hitting the right keys\nbecause if you are you'll be allowed to\nprogress to the next trial or if you are\ntold to stop\nthat is you get the stop signal and you\npress the key anyway you'll be told that\nyou made an error because you did not\nstop now again with very short delays\nbetween the presentation of the arrow\nand the stop signal you are going to be\nmuch better at inhibiting or preventing\nyourself from the behavior at the no go\naspect of motor execution that is what\nyou will find is that if the stop signal\nis presented very shortly after let's\nsay 100 milliseconds which is very very\nbrief amount of time after the\npresentation of the arrow there's a good\nchance that you're going to be able to\nwithhold the\nkey pressing behavior however if the\ndelay is anywhere from 200 to 350\nmilliseconds after the presentation of\nthe arrow chances are that you're going\nto press the button even when you\nshouldn't have on at least some of those\ntrials okay and if you try and game the\nsystem and wait a certain amount of time\nafter the presentation of each Arrow\nthere will also be times in which the\nstop signal does not appear and you fail\nto hit the button in the appropriate\namount of time so it's a fun little task\nit doesn't cost anything or except maybe\na couple of minutes of your time and if\nyou do have time to go to it I think um\nit will give you a much deeper flavor\nfor the sorts of experiments that we're\ntalking about here and that you find\nthat these stop signals are actually\npretty hard to generate when you're\ntrying to learn some new motor behavior\nand that actually illustrates a bigger\nPoint here if today you sense that we've\nbeen talking about studies of you know\ntapping fingers and you know stopping\nbutton presses and that those examples\nare highly artificial and don't really\ntranslate to the real world well keep in\nmind that the tasks that are used in\nthese studies really Target the specific\nneural circuits that is the same neural\ncircuit that you would use for the\nperformance of essentially any motor\ntask now of course other motor tasks\nlike ones where you involve your feet or\ncognitive tasks where you have to think\nreally hard about specific information\nand search for that information assemble\nit in particular ways of course involve\nother neurons and neural circuits that\nwe haven't discussed today but the core\ncomponents of these go and no-go tasks\nare the stop signal tasks really capture\nthe core elements of most all of\ncognitive and or motor learning in some\nway that's fundamentally important okay\nso they have real world relevance\nthe paper that I'd like to just briefly\ndescribe to you is entitled motor\nimagery combined with physical training\nimproves response inhibition in the stop\nsignal task okay so that title is a\nlittle bit wordy but now you know what\nthe stop signal task is\nand what this paper essentially found\nwas that if people did physical training\nso the sort of experiment that I just\ndescribed versus mental training where\nthey sat eyes open and imagined their\nresponses to those arrows and stop\nsignals but they didn't actually\ngenerate any key presses versus a\ncombination of the physical training so\nthe actual pressing of the buttons or\nwithholding pressing of the buttons as\nthe case may be plus mental training\nover the course of about five days using\nthe Contour described of the key\nprinciples of mental training\nperformance we've talked about I'll get\nto the specifics in a moment but it\nreally obeyed most all of what we've\ntalked about if not all of it so\nrepetition simple repeated over about\nfive days and so on and so forth what\nthey found was that the mental training\nand physical training group so mental\nand real world training groups\nperformed significantly better in the\nstop signal reaction time that is they\nwere able to withhold action when they\nneeded to withhold action\nmore frequently and with more accuracy\nthan did either the physical training or\nmental training groups alone so this\nactually\nfits in the face of what we said earlier\nwhich is that physical training is\nalways better than mental training and\nmental training is always better than no\ntraining and it's important to point out\nhere that both the physical training and\nthe mental training groups experience\nsignificant improvements in their\nreaction time and accuracy at the stop\nsignal task but in the case of this\nstudy which is exploring the withholding\nof inappropriate behaviors\nthe combination of mental training and\nphysical training outperformed either\nphysical or mental training alone so\nwhile earlier we said that if you have a\ncertain amount of time in order to train\nsomething up physical training is always\ngoing to be better than mental training\nwell here we have somewhat of an\nexception where if the thing you're\ntrying to learn involves withholding\nmistakes\nas opposed to trying to generate the\nright behaviors per se well then\nyou are probably better off doing a\ncombination of mental training and\nphysical training let me state that a\nlittle bit differently if you're finding\nthat you're screwing up\nsomething not because you can't initiate\nthat particular motor Behavior but\nyou're doing the wrong thing at the\nwrong time you're not able to withhold a\nparticular action well then in that case\nmental training in combination with\nphysical training becomes especially\nimportant so for you coaches for you\nstudents out there keep that in mind\nwhen trying to learn how to withhold\nparticular action sequences because\nthey're not serving you well in the real\nworld\nusing a combination of\nreal world training and physical\ntraining is actually better for you on\nan hour per hour basis than is physical\ntraining alone a couple of key details\nabout this study should you decide to\nimplement these protocols in this study\nthey did approximately 30 Trials of the\nthing that they were trying to get\nbetter at now they did those in the real\nworld so in this case the stop signal\ntask involved actually pressing those\nbuttons and then they had a test phase\nof about\n144 go trials and about 48 stop trials\nokay so this is important if you are a\ncoach or you're a student or you're just\ngoing to self-direct this kind of\nlearning in your self-directed adaptive\nplasticity it's important that you mix\nin both go and no go trials okay it\nwasn't always the case that there was a\nstop signal generated\nthe other thing that was really\nimpressive about the study is that the\nchanges occurred very quickly so the\ntraining was performed five times over\nfive days so once a day for five days\nagain back to this three to five times\nper week principle and\nthe improvements were really significant\nin some cases in fact if you decide to\nperuse this paper you can go to\num you know table two you can see you\nknow in some cases a near doubling in\nthe reduction in reaction time through a\ncombination of mental and physical\ntraining compared to physical training\nalone or mental training alone again\nhowever\nboth physical training and mental\ntraining groups alone saw significant\nimprovements but the combination of\nmental training and physical training\nwas far greater than you saw with either\none of those alone so that's all nicely\nQuantified for you in this paper so\nagain I really like this paper despite\nit not involving a huge number of\nsubjects I think it is a key paper\nbecause it really points to\nsuch an important element of motor\nlearning and training which is this\naction withholding component this no-go\ncomponent that here is captured so\nnicely in the stop signal task so before\nwe round up our discussion about motor\ntraining and visualization I want to\njust briefly touch on some of the\nstudies that have explored why certain\nindividuals are better or worse at motor\ntraining and visualization and what that\nmight correlate with at the beginning of\ntoday's episode I briefly mentioned\naffantasia which is this phenomenon\nwhere some people just simply\ncan't or seem to have extreme Challenge\ngenerating visual imagery there's been a\nnumber of studies exploring how\naphantasics as they're sometimes called\nalthough\nnowadays it's um not considered polite\nif you will to refer to people according\nto their condition so for instance\npropasagnosia is a condition in which\npeople are unable to recognize\nparticular faces\nand in the past these people were\nreferred to as pro-pastagnosis okay as\nif their condition defined them uh right\num nowadays it's not considered polite\nto do that rather we say the person has\nprofessed agnosia or suffers from\nproposed signosia although the words\nsuffer then also has become a little bit\ntouchy I'm going to do my best to just\ntry and be as clear as possible here and\nexplain that people who have aphantasia\ncan have a Fantasia to varying degrees\nso they can either have a complete\nabsence of ability to generate mental\nimagery or they have a poor or kind of\nrudimentary ability to generate visual\nimagery in their Mind's Eye\nit was thought that people who have\naphantasia are not capable of what's\ncalled synesthesia synesthesias or when\npeople have perceptual blending and this\nis not well under the influence of any\nkind of psychedelic or other kind of\ndrug\nperceptual blending of an atypical kind\nor rare kind I actually have some\nfriends I have two friends that have\ndifferent forms of synesthesia One\nAssociates different keys on the piano\nor musical notes with specific colors in\na very very one-to-one specific way so\nthey'll tell you that E flat on the\npiano is a particular tone in their mind\nof of Amber Hugh okay and that\nI forget what other key is associated\nwith a particular shade of red and so on\nand so forth are these people better at\npiano are they more perceptive of colors\nin their environment not necessarily so\nthis is just a perceptual blending it\ndoesn't necessarily lend itself to any\nimproved ability now you could imagine\nwhy people would hypothesize that people\nhave aphantasia especially it's extreme\nform would not be capable\nof or have synesthesias but it turns out\nthat's not the case there are a couple\nof really interesting papers again we\nwill link these in the show note\ncaptions\num one is entitled what is the\nrelationship between aphantasia\nsynesthesia and autism\nand the other one is aphantasia the\nscience of visual imagery extremes and I\nreally like the review at Fantasia the\nscience of visual imagery extremes for\nthose of you that are interested in\nunderstanding aphantasia with more depth\nthe study addressing the relationship\nbetween aphantasia synesthesia and\nautism found that\naphantasia is indeed linked to weak\nvisual imagery but\nthat advantages can also be synesthetics\nand vice versa\nwhat was also interesting about this\nstudy is they addressed the question of\nwhether or not people who have\naphantasia that is a challenge or\ninability to generate mental or visual\nimagery tend to have features associated\nwith autism or residing somewhere on the\nautism spectrum and I'm not trying to\nuse ambiguous language here but the\nwhole set of language in nomenclature\naround autism and autism spectrum is\nalso undergoing revision now because we\nare now coming to understand that\nautism\nand nowadays it's generally not\nconsidered correct to call people\nautistics in that sense but autism is\nconsidered one set of positions along a\nspectrum that includes things like\nAsperger's Etc but that may also include\nother aspects of cognition and even\npersonality so these are starting to be\nviewed not just as a spectrum or one\nContinuum ranging from you know\nnon-autistic to autistic but a lot of\nvariation in subtlety in between and\neven crossing over with other aspects of\nPersonality Psychology and Neuroscience\nokay so I'm not trying to be vague here\nI'm trying to be accurate rather by\nsaying the whole description and\ncategorization of autistic non-autistic\nEtc is undergoing vast revision right\nnow but the important point I think from\nthis paper is that indeed it was found\nthat people who have a Fantasia tend to\nexhibit more of the features that are\nassociated with the autism spectrum now\nhow those things relate to one another\nin terms of their clinical relevance\nisn't clear and of course it is entirely\nunclear as to what's the chicken and\nwhat's the egg there so you could\nimagine no pun intended for instance\nthat people that are on the autism\nspectrum might be less proficient at\ngenerating visual imagery because they\nare exceedingly proficient at other\nthings you could also imagine that\npeople are placed onto the autism\nspectrum as it's sometimes referred to\nor are associated with particular\nfeatures on the autism spectrum because\nin a causal way of the aphantasia and of\ncourse it's extremely important to\nhighlight that not all people that\nconsider themselves or that people\nconsider Autistic or that are on the\nautism spectrum or Asperger's or any\nvariation thereof necessarily have a\nFantasia just as it is that not all\npeople that are on the autism spectrum\ncompletely lack or even lack what's\ncalled theory of mind which is the\nability to sort of empathize And\nsubscribe\nfeelings and motivations of others when\nviewing the actions and perceived\nfeelings of others okay so what I just\ndescribed hopefully doesn't come across\nas just a bunch of word soup what I'm\ntrying to pinpoint is that there does\nseem to be a relationship between one's\nability to generate visual imagery and\ncertain constellations of cognitive and\nemotional perception and behavior and\nvice versa okay\nin a future episode I promise to cover\nsynesthesia and autism and some of the\nrelated\ncognitive and motor aspects of autism\nand things like Asperger's I'm going to\nfeature an expert guess or actually\nseveral expert guests in this area\nbecause it is a rapidly evolving and\nsomewhat controversial field meanwhile I\nthink it's important to at least\nconsider how mental training and\nvisualization might relate to certain\naspects of cognition and our ability to\nvisualize things not just in terms of\nother people's behavior which is one of\nthe common ways that people probe for\nautism and Asperger's versus\nnon-autistic and non-aspergers and so on\nthe so-called theory of Mind task in\neffect asking whether or not children or\nadults can really get in the mind of\nothers that's a typical task developed\nby Simon Baron Cohen\nbut also whether or not children and\nadults are capable of generating mental\nimagery in a really Vivid way or whether\nor not they have minor or even extreme\nChallenge in doing so and perhaps the\nmost direct way to explain why I\nincluded this aspect of the discussion\nof mental training and visualization as\nit relates to different cognitive\nphenotypes or neurocognitive phenotypes\nsuch as autism Asperger's Etc is because\nif you think about motor skill execution\nor cognitive skill execution and the\nrelationship between mental training and\nvisualization and motor skills or\ncognitive skills that's all pretty\nstraightforward when you're talking\nabout finger tapping and go no-go tasks\nand learning piano and things of that\nsort but in many many ways our learning\nof social cognition our learning of how\nto behave in certain circumstances\nwhat's considered normal or atypical\nneurotypical and neuroatypical if you\nwill a lot of that is not just generated\nfrom the inside out but it also involves\nobservation and visualization of what\nare considered appropriate and\ninappropriate definitely placed in\nquotes by the way folks I'm not placing\njudgment I'm just saying appropriate and\ninappropriate for a given context\nbehavior in other words social learning\nand social cognition is every bit as\nmuch a learned behavior and pattern of\ncognitive and motor patterns as is\ntapping fingers or withholding key\npresses in a go no-go task it's just\nthat it transmits into a domain that\ninvolves smiling versus frowning versus\nasking a question versus staying silent\nversus sitting still versus fidgeting\nwhat's appropriate and when what's\ninappropriate and when all of that is\nwhat we call social cognition and has\ndirect parallels to everything we've\nbeen talking about up until this point\nso today we did a deep dive which is\noften the case on this podcast into\nmental training and visualization\nduring the course of the episode I tried\nto lay down one by one the key\ncomponents of an effective mental\ntraining and visualization practice\neverything ranging from making sure that\nthe practice involves brief epochs\nrepeats of specific sequences of motor\nand or cognitive behavior that those be\nrelatively simple so that you can\nimagine them even if you're somebody\nwho's not good at doing mental training\nand visualization and I should mention\nthat if you do mental training and\nvisualization repeatedly over time you\nget better at mental training and\nvisualization there's a what's called\nmetaplasticity here so it's not just\nabout engaging neuroplasticity of\nparticular circuits it's also about\ngetting better at engaging plasticity so\nplasticity of plasticity\nI also describe the key Importance of\nBeing able to actually execute specific\nmovements and cognitive tasks in the\nreal world if you want the mental\ntraining and visualization to be\nespecially effective and we talked about\nthe importance of naming things we\ntalked about the importance of creating\nnot just one but many parallels between\nreal world training and mental training\nand visualization and really on the\nwhole what we established was that\ncognitive and or motor learning really\nis something that you should do in the\nreal world as much as possible but if\nyou can't due to injury or whatever\nconditions\nusing mental training is a reasonable\nsubstitute but not a complete substitute\nand if you can't do real world training\nfor whatever reason injury or otherwise\nthat mental training is going to be\nbetter than no training at all\nand of course we established that at\nleast four withholding action in order\nto get better at a skill a combination\nof physical training and mental training\nis going to be best but that if you're\ntrying to learn a new skill and you're\nhaving challenges with performing that\nskill because of an inability to do the\nskill in the first place or on a\nconsistent basis well then on an\nhour-by-hour basis you're best off\ninvesting your time into the physical\ntraining only incorporating mental\ntraining and visualization if you are\nable to do that on top of the maximum\namount of real world training that\nyou're capable of doing and of course we\ntalked about the actual neural circuits\nand a bit about how the actual\nneuroplasticity occurs early in the\nepisode I mentioned long-term depression\nwell in describing the improvements in\nno-go tasks those stop signal tasks a\nlot of what's observed during those\ntasks is an improvement or rather an\nincrease in long-term depression of\nspecific neural connections so my hope\nis that in learning about those basic\nneural circuits and plasticity\nmechanisms\nand in learning about the critical\nimportance of focus and attention during\nlearning both real world and imagined as\nwell as the importance of sleep and deep\nrest for really consolidating learning\nand the different tools the various\nsteps or principles of effective mental\ntraining and visualization that you now\nhave a fairly coherent or maybe even a\nvery coherent picture of how to develop\nthe best mental training and\nvisualization protocols for you I\nrealize that everyone has different\ngoals everyone has different time\nconstraints if you are somebody that's\ninterested in developing a mental\ntraining and visualization protocol so\nif you're a coach or teacher or simply a\nlearner or you're trying to self-direct\nyour own adaptive plasticity I want to\nemphasize that the key components that\nwe discussed today are essential to\ninclude but I wouldn't obsess about\nwhether or not a given Epoch is 15 or 20\nseconds or even 25 seconds I wouldn't\nobsess over whether or not you got 30\nrepetitions in and then your mind\ndrifted or whether or not you could do\nthe full 50 to 75 or whether or not even\nin your mind's eye you made some errors\nwhat's been shown over and over again in\nthis literature is that performing\nmental training and visualization\nrepeatedly and in a very restricted way\nthat makes it easier to perform those\ntrials over and over and over again and\nwith a high degree of accuracy\nalmost always\nreally we can fairly say and essentially\nevery study where it's been explored has\nled to improvements in real world\nperformance of both cognitive and or\nphysical tasks so if you're trying to\nlearn anything at all I do encourage you\nto explore motor training and\nvisualization because basically all the\nstudies out there\nin fact I couldn't find one exception\nwhere some degree of improvement wasn't\nobserved when people use motor training\nand visualization on a consistent basis\neven just the three to five times per\nweek these simple repeats over and over\nso I don't want to over complicate or\nmake it sound like mental training and\nvisualization has to be performed in a\nvery precise way or that it has to be\ndone perfectly each and every time quite\nto the contrary what is clear is that\nmental training and visualization is a\nvery effective way to improve real world\nperformance if you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast please\nsubscribe to our YouTube channel that's\na terrific zero cost way to support
