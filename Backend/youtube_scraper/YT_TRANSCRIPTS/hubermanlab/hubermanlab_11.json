    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Mary Clair\nHaver Dr Mary Clair Haver is a\nboard-certified OBGYN and an expert in\nperim menopause menopause and all\naspects of female specific health during\ntoday's episode Dr Haver explains\nexactly what per menopause and menopause\nrepresent in terms of their underlying\npsychology and biology and the specific\nactions that all women can and should\ntake in order to navigate these stages\nin Optimal Health she also describes the\nthings that all women should know and do\nlong before per menopause arrives in\norder to best navigate perimenopause and\nmenopause once they arrive we discuss\nspecific nutritional practices\nsupplementation practices as well as\nconversations that you should have with\nyour mother and with your physician in\nparticular your OBGYN not just as per\nmenopause and menopause approach but at\nevery developmental stage a fair amount\nof our discussion centers around hormone\nreplacement therapy not just for\nestrogen but for testosterone in women\nas well and the many misconceptions and\ncontroversies that exist around hormone\nreplacement therapy for menopause Dr\nHaver explains how the specific timing\nin which hormone therapy is initiated\nplays a key role in whether or not the\nhormone therapy is beneficial for women\nor not and of course today's discussion\ngets into ways to offset some of the\nmore common difficulties associated with\nmenopause including sleep issues hot\nflashes inflammation and more by the end\nof today's episode you will have a clear\npicture from Dr Marie Clare Haver about\nwhat per menopause and menopause\nactually represent the best way to\napproach perimenopause and menopause and\nthe various considerations around\nhormone therapy and lifestyle choices\nthat can allow any woman to approach the\nyears of Perry menopause and menopause\nand Beyond with the utmost vitality and\nwellness before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is arero press\nAero press is like a French press but a\nFrench press that always Brews the\nperfect cup of coffee meaning no\nbitterness and excellent taste Aeropress\nachieves the perfect cup of coffee\nbecause it uses a very short contact\ntime between the hot water and the\ncoffee the entire thing takes only about\n3 minutes I started using an aero press\nover 10 years ago I first learned about\nit from a guy named Alan Adler who a\nformer Stanford engineer and inventor he\ndeveloped the aobi Frisbee which I\nbelieve still holds the Guinness book\nworld's records for the furthest thrown\nobject in any event I'm a big fan of\nAdler's inventions so when I heard he\ndeveloped a coffee maker the Aero press\nI tried tried it and I found that indeed\nit makes the best possible tasting cup\nof coffee and I'm not alone in my love\nof the Aeropress coffee maker with over\n55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is the\nbest reviewed coffee press in the world\nAeropress also just released a new\nAeropress tumbler that makes brewing\ncoffee when traveling or anywhere\nincredibly easy this new Aeropress go\nplus is incredible it's super compact\neasy to clean and you can use it\nanywhere all you need is hot water and\nsome coffee and again

mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\nI've spoken many times before in this\npodcast about the critical need for us\nto get adequate amounts of quality sleep\neach night one of the best ways to\nensure a great night's sleep is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that's because in order\nto fall and stay deeply asleep your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° and in order to wake up\nfeeling refreshed and energized your\nbody temperature actually has to\nincrease by about 1 to 3° eight sleep\nmakes it incredibly easy to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nby allowing you to program the\ntemperature of your mattress cover at\nthe beginning middle and end of the\nnight eight sleep also tracks your sleep\nwith very high Precision it will tell\nyou how much slow wave sleep you're\ngetting how much rapid eye movement\nsleep you're getting Each of which is\ncritical for different aspects of\nphysical and emotional recovery during\nsleep and that allows you to dial in the\nexact temperature parameters to really\nensure that you get the best possible\nnight's sleep I've been sleeping on an\neights Sleep mattress cover for well\nover 3 years now and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep for the better\neights sleep recently launched their\nnewest generation pod cover the Pod 4\nultra the Pod 4 ultra has improved\ncooling and heating capacity High\nFidelity sleep tracking technology and\nit also has snoring detection that\nremarkably will automatically lift

offers\nProfessional Therapy with a licensed\ntherapist carried out completely online\nI've been going to therapy for over 30\nyears initially I didn't have a choice\nit was a condition of being allowed back\nin high school but soon I realized that\nquality therapy can be extremely\nvaluable and I now consider doing\ntherapy as important as getting regular\nexercise including cardiovascular\nexercise and resistance training which\nof course I also do every week therapy\nprovided it's with a therapist with whom\nyou have excellent Rapport and feel\nsupported by and from whom you can gain\nvaluable insights can be immensely\nvaluable because it leads to healthier\nthought patterns and actions related to\nyour personal and professional life in\nfact I see doing quality

again that's\nbetterhelp.com\nhuberman and now for my discussion with\nDr maryclair Haver Dr maryclair Haver\nwelcome thanks for having me delighted\nto have you here and to learn about\nmenopause and other aspects of women's\nhealth there's a lot happening in this\narea right now yeah and you are at the\ncenter of what I understand is a new\ndirection for the understanding and\ntreatment of menopause that's what we\nhope and related themes like per\nmenopause yeah and the many important\naspects of female Health that stem from\nit like cardiovascular disease\nosteoporosis right and so on so we will\nget into all of that today\nbut just to kick things off how do we\nDefine menopause so the medical\ndefinition of menopause which I have a\nhuge problem with is one year after the\nfinal menstrual\nperiod And the reason why I have a\nproblem with it is not everyone has a\nmenstrual period what if you've had a\nhysterctomy what if you have an IUD what\nif you've had an ablation or something\nthat's suppressing your periods PCOS so\nfor a lot of women and even clinicians\nthey are struggling to like find that\ndiagnosis because it doesn't fit\neverything what it represents is\nsomething much\nbigger menopause is also one day of your\nlife it is that one day exactly one year\nafter your last period but it represents\nthe end of your ovarian function some of\nus call it ovarian failure ovarian sence\nbut basically what separates males and\nfemales\nis many things separate us but in my\nworld um we are born with all of our\neggs we have 1 to two million at Birth\nby the time we're 30 most of us are down\nto about 10% maybe\n120,000 by the time we're 40 we're down\nto 3% of our egg supply and the quality\nis declining as well so menopause is\nwhen you have no more eggs left and\ntherefore no more sex hormone or very\nlittle sex hormone production from the\novaries so estradiol levels will decline\nless than 1% of your reproductive years\nyour progesterone levels will decline as\nwell testosterone declines for sure but\nwe have other ways to produce it so it's\nsomewhere 50% or less than your\nhealthiest years so is it fair to say\nthat we need a redefinition of what\nmenopause is I think so I think defining\nit as the presence or absence of a\nperiod is a mistake is there any\nconsensus about the quote unquote\ntypical age of onset for men and paws\nand is it changing you know I hear a lot\nabout how the onset set of puberty is\nShifting earlier in females and given\nthat puberty at least by some\ndefinitions relates to the onset of\nmenes uh one could imagine that\nmenopause would be shifting earlier as\nwell so the things that determine when\nwe have puberty or not are different\nthan the things that determine when we\nrun out of eggs um right now in the US\nit's the average age of that one year\nafter your cycle so menopause that one\nday is about 51 to 52 years old however\nnormal is still 45 to 55 and there's a\nbig variation you know that curves\npretty wide\num Perry\nmenopause begins 7 to 10 years before\nthat last minstral period wow okay I say\nwow because um it's the first time I've\never heard a specific number tacked to\nthis word per menopause maybe we could\ntalk a little bit about per menopause\nsince it sounds like it represents a\ntransition phase into official menopause\nright um however one chooses to Define\nthat what are some of the I don't know\nif I should call them symptoms sure\nwhere I should uh just well let me let\nme do let me walk you through the\nendocrinology and then we can go through\nsymptoms so you understand so in a\nnormal healthy menstrual cycle before\nmenopause ever becomes an issue the\nfemale hormone cycle is a very EKG like\nreproducible monthly rise and fall of\nestrogen progesterone and then the brain\nhormones LH FSH and then g& RH so the\nway it works is our brain in the\nhypothalamus um is sensing for has a\nlittle sensor in the blood looking for\nestradiol levels and when they get low\nit sends G&R down to the pituitary\nsaying hey tell the ovaries to start\ntrying to ovulate so we can get more\nestrogen on board the process of\novulation is what drives up our estrogen\nlevels okay so pituitary sends out the\npulses of LH and FSH which then lead to\novulation when we reach in perimenopause\nthe beginning of perimenopause that\ncritical level of egg\nsupply those signals don't work as well\nwe start becoming resistant to the LH\nand FSH pulle surges\nso the brains like hey I told you we\nneed more estradiol and the pituitary is\nlike I sent the signal and the brains\nlike send more so we get much higher\npulses of FSH and then finally the ovary\nkind of is able to get that egg out but\nsometimes it's delayed so we have the\ntiming of that monthly predictable cycle\ngoes arise sometimes the periods are\ncloser together sometimes they're\nfurther apart but also the estrogen and\nprogesterone levels start changing\ndramatically we see much higher surges\nof estradiol than we ever had in our pre\nproductive years and then much lower\nlevels underneath so we end up with this\nvery volatile curve and not predictable\nat all we call it in our world the zone\nof chaos so it is literal hormonal chaos\nwhat used to look like this you know\nevery month is\nnow just just insane and very very very\nunpredictable that is why we don't have\na good blood test in per menopause to\nmake the diagnosis those of us in the\nmense use symptoms usually to make the\ndiagnosis and we rule out other\nconditions that might overlap so per\nmenopause basically critical threshold\nit's a downward Trend overall of\nestradiol but is a very chaotic you know\nrace till you Flatline and bottom out I\nsee so for those listening um your\ndescription of the um kind of the\namplitude of the estrogen surge it gets\nmuch greater in this per menopause phase\nyou also mentioned that follicle\nstimulating hormone which comes from the\npituitary has to be or somehow is\nupregulated in this phase because I\ndon't know is it that the recept for FSH\nare somehow not responsive at the level\nof the ovary do we know what's happening\nto the ovary is it obviously the signals\ngetting there it's not effective so then\nthe brain is kicking out more FSH is it\nthat the quality is poor and then around\neach germ cell is the tholian cells\nwhich is actually where the estradi the\nwhole pathway going from you know\nactually testosterone's converted to\nestrad so that whole pathway you know it\nstill will respond but the cells are\njust old you know is the way that it's\nbeen explained to me and from what I've\nread I think we need a lot more research\nin this area because that is how we're\ngoing to help women I think longer term\nis understanding that process better but\nyou know all I learned in school 25\nyears ago was it's the transition to\nmenopause the end you know the whole\nendocrinological process I didn't learn\ntill about two years ago and my guess is\njust based on my understanding of the\nonly recent Trend\ntoward emphasizing studies of both\nfemale and male even just mice in mouse\nmodels which is where generally this\nstuff originates and then it shifts into\nhumans once certain targets are\nidentified um only recently has the NIH\ninsisted that there be uh female uh mice\nin the studies of mice I mean it's it's\nbeen a few years now but that's a you\nknow sex as a biological variable is is\nactually a requirement in most Grant\napplications unless of course there's a\nspecific reason to study only one or the\nother um sex of mice so you can imagine\nthat um the dir of research in this area\nis due to a a long um desert of um\nabsence of studies into what is per\nmenopause right so for women who are in\nthe age range of per menopause or who\nare thinking about this are there things\nthat they can do in order to either\nupregulate the sensitivity of the ovary\nto FSH or to somehow prolong this period\nof per menopause um and I should also\nsay what are some reasons why they would\nwant to do that um you know obviously\nthis is part of the um of the Arc of\nmaturation of the female reproductive\naxis but of course that alone is not a\nreason to not try and um I guess we say\noptimize it for one's well-being so we\ndon't know when you the best way I can\nhighlight why we don't know or or where\nthe dollars are going for research you\nknow we go to PubMed and you type in the\nword pregnancy 1.1 million articles come\nup type in the word menopause it's down\nto\n97,000 really you type in the word per\nmenopause and I checked this like 2\nweeks ago and it was like 6,400 and\nsomething wow yeah that is surprising so\nor maybe it shouldn't be surprising\ngiven what we were just talking about in\nterms of so as far as like why those\ncells are becoming resistant and what's\nhappening at the level of the receptor I\nthink we need a lot more research in\nthis area I think it's starting to\nhappen because women are realizing\nthere's a demand now because the older\nyou are when you go through menopause\nthe healthier you are for cardi\nmetabolic disease it's the loss of\nestrogen that accelerates our path to\nthose\ndiseases so are there clinical signs of\nperimenopause that either directly or\nindirectly relate to these bigger surges\nin FSH and these larger amplitude um\nestrogen uh surges the the two best\ndocumented and studied are mental health\nchanges\num the brain does not like the chaos of\nand and the neurotransmitters are very\nvery sensitive to estrogen and\nprogesterone and even testosterone and\nso we see aberration in serotonin and\norpine phrine and and dopamine as the\nlevels start becoming chaotic so we have\nat least a 40% increase of mental health\ndisorders in and SSRI use doubles across\nthe menopause transition across per\nmenopause\nand now the data is showing that women\nwho are given hormone therapy in their\nper menopause have a lower incidence of\nneonet depression and now the\nneuroscientists are saying hey for these\nwomen who are developing depression in\nper menopause giving them estrogen is\nbetter than an SSRI they're going to\nhave a better outcome I think most\npeople don't realize how rich the brain\nand rest of the nervous system are with\nhormone receptors in particular I\nestrogen receptors and as you mentioned\ntestosterone receptors as well Androgen\nreceptors um and the often direct\nrelationship between estrogen and the\nneuromodulators such as serotonin\ndopamine epinephrine aceto Gaba for for\num\nprogesterone yeah it's it's interesting\nduring neural development which is where\nI started off which was um neural\nembryonic development the hormones exert\nyou know these widespread roles in\ndefining even which neurons will Express\ncertain neurotransmitters and then\nsomehow the field of Neuroscience is\nonly recently gotten on board the idea\nthat um this intimate relationship\nbetween hormones and neurotransmitters\nis something to consider in essentially\nevery aspect of of brain health right\nnot just cognition but maintenance of\nneurons and um offsetting neurod\ndegeneration and so on um I mentioned\nthat only um so that people I think\ntypically think of hormones as something\nsure there's a signal from the brain and\nbut that hormones are mostly of the body\nwhen in fact hormones play an absolutely\ncrucial role within the brain yeah so\nyou mentioned that during per menopause\nthere there are symptoms that are I\nguess it's per are mainly reflected as\nshifts in mental health so is this women\nsuddenly feeling um kind of um less uh\noptimistic is it like what what's the\nsort of um constellation of of of\npsychological shifts that can occur so\nwe\nsee uh increasing anxiety we see\ndefinitely loss of executive functioning\nso new onset of add type symptoms um we\nsee of course the cognitive you know\nwhat we call brain fog and and lay\nterminology which is cognitive you know\nso they lose their words they're not\nable to do the calculations at work like\ntheir executive functioning ability in\ntheir jobs is huge like one in five\nwomen will quit their jobs because of\nmenopause symptoms\num that's that's an outrageous number\nyeah and the the economic impact is huge\nand so now companies are starting to get\non board and this is a Time Of Our Lives\nwhen the kids are grown for a lot of us\nyou know and we're trying we're ready to\nlean into our positions and really get\ninto leadership we have all this\nexperience and now we can't REM you know\nand now all of a sudden these and their\nconfidence is just wrecked so and then\nthe depression and they're not sleeping\nand like it's this horrible feedback\ncycle that they end up in that we end up\nin yeah I wasn't aware that one in five\nis is striking that came out of the UK\nbut they're starting to like crunch the\nnumbers here in the US and it's looking\nvery similar I know we're going to get\ninto actionable tools later as it\nrelates to menopause but as long as\nwe're discussing this phase of per\nmenopause uh what are some of the basic\nthings sure that women could a pay\nattention to we don't want to make\npeople hypervigilant to the point of\nanxiety but but um certainly given the\nfrequency and given the\nimplications um it's important for them\nto pay attention to this phase and then\nsome of the things that they can do to\nyou know either behaviorally or perhaps\nthrough other tools offset um some of\nthese changes uh dysfunctional uterine\nbleeding um which is abnormal periods so\nand again nothing's off the table it\ncould be heavy periods menaga too\nfrequent too few skipping it's really\nreally chaotic and but a lot of women\nare suffering horribly from really\ndebilitating periods either through the\nvolume of blood loss or they're having\nyou know cramps and you know really and\nso 90% of us will have that as a symptom\num fatigue is a huge one a lot of them\nthe symptoms are kind of vague you know\nand can be attributed to a lot of other\nthings in our in my what we call the\nmenopausia chat group you know we have a\nlot of theories about a lot of\nconditions like\nfibromyalgia and the irritable bladder\nsyndromes and that probably just per\nmenopausa menopause and doctors didn't\nknow how to put you know make that\ndiagnosis and so you know muscular\nskeletal system takes a huge hit through\nthe transition so all of a sudden you\nhave no injury and you're having hip\npain joint pain back pain with you know\nyou go to the doctor and you get an\nx-ray you do whatever work up and they\ncan't find anything wrong palpitations\nare huge it is a vasomotor symptom so\nalong with hot flashes palpitation so a\nwoman will walk into the emergency room\nsweating profusely horrible palpitation\nshe's anxiety and they'll tell her she's\nhaving a panic attack you know um\nthey'll work her up you know\neverything's negative and just say well\nit's panic attack go home and no one\nknew to connect the dots and figure out\nthat this woman was in her menopause\ntransition and this is how her body was\nexpressing it it's complicated because\nwe have sex hormone receptors as you do\nin every organ system of our body and\nwhen these levels start going chaotic it\ncan present in so many different ways\nand so when the patients come to me I'm\ndoing blood work not a lot of hormone\nlevels because they're not super helpful\nbut I am doing thyroid workups and\nautoimmune workups and looking for\nnutritional deficiencies and anemia and\ndifferent things because I don't want to\nmiss those things and just pen\neverything on per\nmenopause are there lifestyle factors\nthat can offset some of this it's not a\nperfect correlation but the healthier\nyou are so anti-inflammatory diet you\nknow Mediterranean s galison dietes you\nknow nutrition pattern um regular\nexercise good sleep habits you know all\nthe pillars of Health the healthier you\nare when you hit per menopause the\nbetter the course is going to be for you\nthey're looking at extending the life of\nthe ovary with pharmacology we know what\ncan shut it down faster so we have kind\nof a genetic predetermined age of when\nyou're going to lose all your eggs but\nwe can speed that up so if you smoke\nyou're going to go through menopause\nsooner than your twin would have if she\ndidn't smoke okay if you don't have\nchildren and you ovulate regularly then\nthe more you OV the faster you run\nthrough your egg supply okay interesting\nI I wasn't aware of those data that's I\nI don't know that most people are aware\nof those dat if you have a hysterctomy\nand you leave your ovaries behind I\ndidn't know I didn't never counsel my\npatients about this you lose four years\noff the life of your ovaries if you have\na tubal liation you use lose a year and\na half huge genetic disparities so\nAfrican-Americans tend to go through a\nyear and a half sooner and then there's\ncaucasians in the middle and then Asian\nfamily tend to go through later and\nthey're not sure why you know a year or\ntwo years years so there are if you have\nchemotherapy if you have surgery if you\nhave any inflammatory process in the\nabdomen irritable bowel or\nendometriosis you're going to lose some\nof the life of the ovary you mentioned\nsmoking are there any data on vaping not\nyet I haven't seen any there might be\nout there I just haven't seen it yet no\nI'm I'm guessing uh if they're out there\nthey're not um prominent or you would\nhave seen them I'm curious about vaping\nbecause a lot of people are vaping\ninstead of smoking and hopefully people\nare neither vaping nor smoking because\nit seems that we had an expert on vaping\non the podcast recently from Stanford\nand it seems that um there's nothing\ngreat about it right and there may be\nsome things really bad about it but was\njust curious given that a number of\nyoung women and men for that matter are\nvaping nowadays who smoking rates have\ngone way way down another 10 years\nbefore we'd be able to you know see when\nthose women are going through menopause\nyou know because vaping I think of\nvaping as younger the younger generation\num like my kids they're they people in\ntheir 20s and 30s 10 V so we're you know\nwe're 20 years out from seeing how it's\ngoing to affect them is there any\nevidence that alcohol can impact\nmenopause I haven't seen any but I can't\nimagine that you know heavy use of\nalcohol would prolong the life of the\novary in any way right so um and we know\nthat any use of alcohol has some\npotential role in disrupting sleep and\npresumably like everything else uh if\nyou disrupt sleep you disrupt things for\nthe for the worse and got it so you\nmentioned um rough ages for onset of uh\nmenopause um 51 but anywhere from 45 to\n55 and the per menopause uh is defined\nas a period about seven years prior to\nthat 7 to 10 okay um what's the earliest\nyou've ever had a patient come in who\nentered menopause what's the latest you\npersonal patient 27 and she came in just\na couple months ago so she had a special\ncondition we call premature ovarian\nfailure and she had found me on social\nmedia and wanted to come just to make\nsure she was doing everything right and\nso early menopause is defined as between\nthe ages of 40 and 45 and then premature\nmenopause or pre premature ovarian\ninsufficiency it's not a complete\nfailure for most women but it is very\nvery low is any time before the age of\n40 so this patient kind of got kicked\naround for 2 years went to her doctor no\nperiods horrible hot flashes again she\nwas 25 and it was not on his radar and\nhe never tested her for menopause and it\ntook her you know 18 months to get the\ndiagnosis and so the longer your body is\naway from estrogen the higher the risk\nfactor and it's been all over the news\nthis week where we know that untreated\npremature ovarian insufficiency has a\nearlier death so they have higher\ncardiovascular disease diabetes stroke\nall because estrogen is so protective\nand they have to go so long without it\nwe can back negate most of those risks\nby giving her aggressive hormone therapy\nearly so she came in to make sure she\nwas on the right dose because in\npremature ovarian failure we don't want\nto give them menopause hormone therapy\ndoses they're too low we want to get her\nmore like she would have which is three\nto four times the amount of estrogen as\na reproductive aged woman and so and she\nwanted to have a period so she would\nseem like her friends you know it was an\nemotional thing for her which I totally\nrespect and so um so we were doing\ncyclical progesterone for her so that\nshe would have a withdrawal bleed and\nfeel like she was normal basic question\nbut I I'm curious all I'll ask um given\nthat levels of estrogen change so much\nnaturally during the course of the um\novulation cycle menstrual cycle um with\nestrogen therapy is it a constant dose\nor it's modulated by week to week day to\nday question so there are some formulas\nso and when we look at hormonal\ncontraception so the the biggest\ndifference\nbetween contraceptive Doses and\nmenopause hormone therapy doses they're\nboth based in estrogen and progesterone\nmostly okay\nthe hormone therapy was developed to\nstop a hot flash for decades menopause\nwas defined by the presence or absence\nof you know severe menopause was defined\nby hot flashes or not they didn't didn't\nnothing else and so they developed the\nformulations with enough estrogen to\nstop hot flashes birth control was\ndeveloped to stop ovulation you don't\novulate you don't get pregnant and it's\nbut the difference between lowd dose\nbirth control pill and higher dose\nmenopause hormone therapy is not that\nfar away and\nso um that a lot of people don't\nunderstand now the types of estrogen we\nuse in birth control are a little bit\ndifferent most birth control is ethanol\nestradiol which is one of the synthetics\nwe have literally millions and millions\nof women's year data on it we know it's\nsafety profile I think we're not\ncounseling patients adequately about\nbirth control as far as what it does to\ntheir testosterone and what it can do to\nyou know oh it's fine it's safe I took\nit for years but I think we need to do a\nbetter job as a specialty on counseling\nwomen but I do think it's a good\nmedication and then on menopause hormone\ntherapy you know it's much lower dose it\ndoes not suppress ovulation so in per\nmenopause it's a little bit of the Wild\nWest which one we're going to use how\nhigh do we want to go do we need to\nsuppress her ovulation because she's got\nacne or horrible periods or cramps or\nsomething where I want to suppress that\novulation to help her\nor can I give her menopause hormone\ntherapy doses which in effect think of\nthe hypothalamus I'm giving her just\nenough estrogen to calm the brain down\nand tell them everything's okay we're\nnot going to get those big Peaks and\ndrops and if she still ovulates that's\nokay too as many of you know I've been\ntaking ag1 for more than 10 years now so\nI'm delighted that they're sponsoring\nthis podcast to be clear I don't take\nag1 because they're a sponsor rather\nthey are a sponsor because I take ag1 in\nfact I take ag1 once and often twice\nevery single day and I've done that\nsince starting way back in\n2012 there is so much conflicting\ninformation out there nowadays about\nwhat proper nutrition is but here's what\nthere seems to be a general consensus on\nwhether you're an omnivore a carnivore a\nvegetarian or a vegan I think it's\ngenerally agreed that you should get\nmost of your food from unprocessed or\nminimally processed sources which allows\nyou to eat enough but not overeat get\nplenty of vitamins and minerals\nprobiotics and micronutrients that we\nall need for physical and mental health\nnow I personally am an omnivore and I\nstrive to get most of my food from\nunprocessed or minimally processed\nsources but the reason I still take ag1\nonce and often twice every day is that\nit ensures I get all of those vitamins\nminerals probiotics Etc but it also has\nadaptogens to help me cope with stress\nit's basically a nutritional insurance\npolicy meant to augment not replace\nquality food so by drinking a serving of\nag1 in the morning and again in the\nafternoon or evening I cover all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nreport feeling much better in a number\nof important ways such as energy levels\ndigestion sleep and more so while many\nsupplements out there are really\ndirected towards obtaining one specific\noutcome ag1 is foundational nutrition\ndesigned to support all aspects of\nwell-being related to mental health and\nphysical health if you'd like to try ag1\nyou can go to drink a1.com huberman to\nclaim a special offer they'll give you\nfive free travel packs with your order\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman as long as we're on the topic\nof birth control earlier you mentioned\nthat the IUD and presumably this is some\nform of the IUD not necessarily copper\nIUD can um disrupt or stop a period a\nperiod um maybe we could talk a little\nbit about the different forms of birth\ncontrol um IUD um as the pill quote\nunquote um old term but um uh I think\nmost people know what we're referring to\nwhen we say that the ring um and and on\nand on um what is your stance on on\nthese different forms of birth control\nas it relates to their safety um you\nknow a guess about a year and a half ago\nI hosted a um a female physician guest\non on this podcast and both sides of the\nuh birth control issue were touched on\none the relationship to um potential um\ninhibition of certain forms of cancers\nbut then also the potential for certain\nside effects maybe even Cancers and so\nit you know it seems like it can play\nout both ways and this is a very heated\ntopic yeah um in fact so much so that I\nlearned that if one is going to post a\nclip of any of this on social media it\nalmost makes sense to have them in the\nsame post because we actually did both\nof them we we we did a post where it was\nmore about the the pros of birth control\nand then the cons of birth control as as\nstated through um the words of this very\nsame clinician um so we will be sure to\nso for anyone listening would you ever\nanswer comes first stay tuned for the\nnext answer because um my understanding\nis that it's not a black and white issue\nI think the best form of birth control\nis a vasectomy and so much of\ncontraception is dumped in a female's\nlap you know in a committed relationship\nand I can't tell you the comments I've\nheard when a patient comes to me and she\nwants to get X Y and Z simply for\ncontraception she's absolutely perfectly\nhealthy there's nothing wrong with her\nshe just doesn't want to be pregnant and\nI'm like okay you're done how you know\nshe's completed her family she's out you\nknow and I'm like tell your partner to\nget a vecto oh he won't do that you know\nso now all of the risk and the onus goes\non her and so we we go through the\noptions of surgical like you know tub\nlegation um which is basically blocking\nthe tube so when I you know talk to my\nteenagers I'm like here's how you not\nget pregnant a you don't have sex well\nif that's not an option then we have to\neither block the sperm stop the egg from\ncoming out or stop the place where they\ncommunicate which is the fallopian tube\nand so when we look at the different\nforms of hormonal contraception which\nare meant to stop ovulation suppress\novulation because they're telling the\nbrain we have enough estrogen\nprogesterone on board quiet down so it\ndoesn't send those signals to the ovary\nright and so that can come in a pill\nform a patch form a ring form and they\neach have their own Pros cons risk\nbenefits you know transdermal has less\nrisk of blood clots versus oral has a\nhigher risk of blood clot in any form of\nestrogen so so we talk about that we\nlook at their family history or if they\nhave MTHFR any of the clotting genes you\nknow then we Council directly versus the\nIUD the iuds create an an inflammatory\nenvironment in the uterus that blocks\nand it creates a plug in the servic so\nthat the sperm can't get\nthrough and then if any do get through\nit's a toxic environment in the uterine\ncavity for the sperm so that's really\nhow the those iuds work some iuds are\ncoated with progesterone progestin not\nprogesterone progestogen and those end\nup decidualizing the endometrium so\nthinning that lining from that constant\nprogesterone to the point where you stop\nbleeding so a lot of my patients really\nloved that option of being aaric no\nperiods just for the convenience of it\nbut they were still ovulating in the\nbackground so we're not suppressing\ntheir natural cycles just their periods\nI see and is there any evidence that the\nuse of any form of birth control can\ndisrupt the um timing or the uh\navailability of I realize availability\nof eggs is a very um uh clinically naive\nbiologically naive statement but\nbasically what I'm saying can it can any\nof them accelerate the onset of per\nmenopause can they delay the onset of\nonset a little bit you know it's it's\nmaybe a year if you use it for a long\ntime from what the data shows so women\nwho suppress ovulation we lose about\n11,000 eggs each month with the\novulation process to get one out 11,000\nrace to the Finish Line and only one\nmakes it but we lose about 11,000 in the\nprocess so women who are constantly you\nknow for a long time suppressing\novulation will have um a slightly older\nage of menopause had they not done that\nwhen you say slightly older what's the\nlongest extension of of the best I could\nsee in the data was maybe nine months\nokay from nine months use ofth control\nso so maybe like 5 to 10 year use I have\nto look at the data again to be you know\nI'd have to look that one up but it was\nyears got it um to to gain an extra\nmaybe N9 months maybe a year of ovarian\nlife I see and um nowadays uh at least\nif people have the means there's some um\nTrend if you will toward um freezing\none's eggs um this might be a good\nopportunity to just State something that\ncame up before when we had Dr Natalie\nCrawford on the podcast to talk about\nfemale fertility um I think surprising\nto many people\nwas her statement that not because it's\ncontroversial but because we just don't\nhear this often enough that harvesting\neggs for freezing or for IVF does not\ndiminish the pool of eggs that one would\nhave meaning you're losing them each\nmonth right anyway yeah and so they're\nonly pulling out I don't know 10 12\nmaybe in a cycle and when you're losing\n11,000 with an ovulation so it really\nisn't going to to effect when you go\nthrough menopause such a crucial thing\nfor people to hear um I think uh there\nwere a number of comments when we posted\nthat clip on social media of people uh\nwomen saying wow I didn't realize that\nharvesting eggs would not um somehow uh\nshift the onset of menopause earlier and\nso for the record we are not saying that\nwe're saying that um it does not and um\nand very interesting that the use of of\nbirth control but I'm guessing only\nforms of birth control that suppress\novulation can delay the onset of per\nmenopause menopause by about 9 months\nmaximum maximum um so things like the\ncopper IUD that right which um prevent\npregnancy by creating a unfavorable\nenvironment for the sperm rather than\ndisrupting ovulation in any way will not\npresumably extend par menopause\nmenopause okay just want to make sure\nwe're crystal clear for people you're\nbeing very clear but I I want to make\nsure that I'm clear on it and then\nreiterate because this can be um uh kind\nof tricky territory I think there are a\nlot of assumptions about this stuff and\nthere's a lot of lore out there what why\ndo you think that is is that because of\nthe lack of solid research and\ncommunication in this area I think so or\nor is it something else you know I I I\nthink these are um tricky topics for for\nuh discussion often because we hear all\nthis stuff like birth control pills\ndisrupt one's ability to get pregnant\nwhen they come off or where it we just\nlearn that it can delay the onset of per\nmenopause which by extension means\nthere's a greater window for pregnancy\nif one\num thinks about it that way but uh why\ndo you think it's it's so um such a\ntangled discussion out there I think\njust the way that Society views\npregnancy and female health and you know\nat least you know I live on the internet\nnow you know this new life has brought\nme life on the internet and this what\nthe algorithms are showing me yeah it's\na very friendly everyone is super\neveryone loves you it's a listen it's\nwhat you're doing um is so important and\nuh I understand the the statement behind\nthat statement I I think um but it's so\nimportant because it people are getting\nthe opportunity to learn about really\ncritical public health and female health\nissues um in a way that just was\ninaccessible before yeah it is and I I\nit's good and bad you know there's a lot\nof lore and misinformation that's\ngetting propagated and I feel like as a\nspecialty you know as a women's health\nspecialist we did this to ourselves you\nknow we have\nnot properly educated ourselves we have\nnot spent the money the research really\nyou know championed women after\nreproduction when you look at the\ndollars and and the research and where\nit goes in women's health I mean Women's\nHealth just gets a little sliver of all\nthe NIH funding when you look at all NIH\nfunding and what goes to menopause it's\n0.003% unb less than half a percent this\nis onethird of a woman's life and when\nyou look at McKenzie and Company just\njust published um a report where they\npulled 680 studies on like chronic\ndiseases diabetes hypertension\ncardiovascular disease and they looked\nat how they had they were women included\nin the studies but how many presented\nthe data for the different Sexes like\nwhat happened to men versus what\nhappened to women it was only 50% of the\nArticles actually did Sex specific\ndifferences and how this medication\naffected this process or whatever and\nthen the ones that did 30% of women had\npoorer outcomes and and the other and on\nthe flip side 10% of men had poorer\noutcomes and these things aren't just\nbeing brought to light so the the lack\nof recognition of sex specific\ndifferences in chronic disease and how\nmenopause kind of plays into all that I\nthink is where the future needs to go so\nwe deserve as much good health as\neveryone else because yes we're living\nlonger than men but 20 to 25% of that\nlife is in poor\nhealth wow that's a a really significant\nstatement I mean I think think that the\nNational Institutes of Health has been\nterrific in establishing new institutes\nwithin it um they even have a\ncomplimentary Health Institute now\nthere's the the national eye institute\nthere's you know cancer here um is there\na plan or one would hope for a dedicated\nInstitute for Women's Health there push\num so there was one piece of legislation\nthat got pushed through the Biden signed\nit and it was a $100 million for Women's\nHealth and that that got chopped up very\nquickly and menopause did get a little\npiece of it because we're also really\nstruggling with endometriosis and you\nknow a lot of the female specific\nuterine diseases and and PCOS and things\nand so we need more funding there as\nwell um and then there's another bill\nthat just got that's the one hi Berry\nwas like um on TV talking about another\nbill for $250 million that bill includes\nlanguage for education of providers so\nwe have a whole generation of providers\nERS like I graduated my residency\ntraining the year of the Whi came out so\nall we had very little like real\nclinically significant menopause\neducation and then we knew about HRT and\nwe were giving it in clinic um if she\nwas coming in with severe hot flashes\nbut that got taken off the table after\nthe Whi and then we have a whole gener\nlike all menopause education basically\nstopped after so Whi Women's Health\nInitiative HRT no that's that's okay\njust so that people are on board hormone\nreplacement therapy\num yeah it's um it's a Well we can\nencourage the uh expansion of of uh\nresearch in these areas and with this\ndiscussion and um certainly uh I was on\nNH panels for years um as a regular\nmember in the I institute and what I've\nnoticed with um NIH is that they are\nvery responsive uh to the public call\nfor growth of research in particular\nareas you know it can take time it's\ngovernment after all and they need\nfunding there's a finite amount of\nfunding but but I think that um R rarely\ndo I ever get into legislature based\nthings but if you are somebody who cares\nabout um more funding in a given area of\nresearch it's actually very\nstraightforward what to do you call your\nCongressman or Senator and you tell them\nliterally you leave a message I find\nthis kind of interesting it's so it's\nkind of like what we learned in um\nsocial studies and uh in elementary\nschool but you call your you call your\num Senator or your governor and you\nleave a message and you say Hey you know\nthere's this issue that impacts a ton of\npeople and it's really important and um\nthe next time it comes up uh when\nbudgeting uh comes up in Washington it's\nreally important and if you hear about a\nbill you can call and support a bill and\nbelieve it or not some of that stuff\nactually translates to more funding in a\ngiven area in fact that the brain\ninitiative which unfortunately had its\nbudget cut significantly recently maybe\nput that funding back um but you know\narose from the um I believe it was the\nchild of two Neuroscience professors up\nat University of Wisconsin I'm probably\ngoing to get some details wrong but um\nso the khil are the are the professors\nas I recall and their son over Hood all\nthese conversations growing up about the\nimportance of brain science and then\neventually pushed through government\nchannels for more money for brain\nresearch and then we had a a long phase\nof of um pretty pretty substantial\nresearch and then it was cut so these\nthings um but it persists and so these\nthings really matter can impact so and\nmaybe we should send them a clip of of\nyour statements on this podcast getting\nback to um kind of things that people\ncan control so for people who are\nheading into per menopause or who are in\nthe perimenopause phase um aside from\nthe the typical things that we hear\nabout fortunately a lot these days like\ngetting adequate sleep um getting\nexercise um nutrition maybe we could\ntouch a little bit on nutrition in a\nmoment you mentioned Mediterranean diet\nGalviston diet um things that are going\nto promote overall health right um are\nthere any things that people can do\nmaybe even take that would improve uh\ntheir outcomes in this phase like I I've\nheard of people and I have no bias here\nor even knowledge of the research on\nthis if there is any of people taking\nfor instance grape seed extract or\npeople trying to do a number of things\nto reduce inflammation kind of General\nthemes around um self-care and wellness\nthese days but what are sort of the five\nor six that come to mind um perhaps as\nlike the things that can move the levers\nin the right direction what would tell\nmy 35-year-old self you know who just\nkind of went into this obliviously and\nwhat I know now\nis your diet is probably one of the most\nimportant things that determines your\nlevel of inflammation and then estrogen\nis a really powerful anti-inflammatory\nhormone and we lose that protection when\nwe go through we start losing it through\nthe transition so whatever you can do in\nthe other areas especially with\nnutrition sleep stress reduction we need\nto do it so fiber we are not getting\nenough fiber in our diet in the western\ndiet I think it's most women are getting\n10 to 12 grams per day and we need at\nleast 25 and the health benefits tend to\nmax out around 30 32 grams per day so\nfocusing on foods that are rich in fiber\nFiers is feeding the gut microbiome\nslowing down glucose absorption you know\nglucose levels of sugar absorption into\nthe bloodstream it is slowing down the\nrate you know certain parts of Transit\nand pulling more water into the gut like\nthere's nothing bad about it\nright the foods that are rich in fiber\nhave a lot of other stuff that's good\nfor you too co-actors vitamins minerals\nnutrient you know just they're just so\nhealthful um and then ansans you know\njust find things that crunch that are\nand get as many colors as you can you\nknow green red purple yellow every color\nrepresents a phytochemical that is going\nto be good for you in different areas of\nyour body and try to keep it as varied\nas possible um we're not getting enough\nprotein and I have to thank Dr Gabrielle\nlion you know really helping me focus\nand on that you know when I first wrote\ngalison diet to be honest and\ntransparent it was for weight loss and\nyou know I was frustrated with my weight\ngain and I that was the pain point my\npatients had and that was my pain point\nbut I didn't realize it represented\nsomething much more Sinister than than\njust the way I looked you know the\nvisceral fat gain and so uh learning\nabout visceral fat and what it really\nmeans and that is for your listeners the\nfat that wraps around our internal\norgans it's a very different fat than\nthe subcutaneous fat and you know a\npremenopausal woman so we age matched\nand looked at visceral fat levels\nmeasuring it with the uh um dexus\nscanner\nyou have about 8% of your fat as\nvisceral as a premenopausal person and\nthen when you go through the transition\nit's 23% wow with no changes in diet and\nexercise the visceral fat is not\nsomething that gets enough attention I\nthink everyone thinks about subcutaneous\nfat because it's relation cosmetically\ndistressing but really yeah um and one\ndoesn't want too much of it for health\nreasons e either but the it's the um\nintval fat that at least by my\nunderstanding is is really uh the most\nproblematic for for for our health it's\na harbinger of of chronic disease so I\nread that weight gain is one of the\nprimary symptoms of menopause itself\nyeah so it's you have to be careful how\nyou think about that when we when we\nplot weight gain versus age it's a very\nstraightforward linear curve and\nmenopause does not seem to affect that\nwhat is happening is a body composition\nchange we are losing muscle and we are\ngaining visceral fat and so and you\nmight be gaining some subcutaneous fat\nbut those are kind of the key things\nthat are happening and so that's really\nwhen I'm counseling patients what I'm\nfocusing on because I have a body\nscanner in my office where I can tell\nthem what their level of visceral fat is\nin their muscle mass and so we bone and\nmuscle that muscular skeletal unit works\ntogether and so we see this acceleration\nof muscle loss which controls our basal\nmetabolic rate which determines our\nresistance to insulin which you know so\nit's just that's the the organ of\nlongevity that's what I I've learned\nfrom Dr lion you know and everything we\ncan do to hang on to it and build is so\nimportant so protein going back to the\noriginal Point protein intake is key and\nwomen by and large are getting 50 to 60\ngrams of protein per day and we really\nprobably need 80 100 120 depending on\nour body composition yeah thanks for\nmentioning Dr Gabrielle L she's doing\nwhat I view world yeah terrific work\nreally promoting Women's Health and\nhealth generally I know she's now I\nbelieve is exploring um Advanced\nTraining in uh in urology for males as\nwell and um so you know it's um it's\nit's only fair to to credit her with\nwith really expanding into these\ndifferent areas but especially this idea\nthat we need and women perhaps in\nparticular from what I understand um\nshe'll be on the podcast soon so we'll\nget more of a of an understanding at\nleast one gram of quality protein per\npound of lean body mass maybe even per\npound of body weight per day in order to\noptimize their their health yeah she's\nshe's definitely on the higher end you\nknow the Whi the Women's Health\nInitiative some of the my favorite data\nyou know it's not all bad it's data and\nwas looking at Frailty scores and\nprotein intake in women and what they\nfound was women who were having 1.5 to\n1.7 so basically it was the higher their\nprotein intake the less likely they were\nto be frail the end and it was you know\nthey were reaching that was kind of\npeeking out somewhere around 1.5 to 1.7\ngram per kilogram of lean body mass and\nmost women are getting around you know\nthe FDA recommends\n08 wow and source of protein also\nimportant high quality right right you\nneed all the amino acids yeah very\ninteresting um now that's in menopause\nbut presumably also so starting those\nhabits in Perry just getting that laid\ndown and getting those habits laid down\nare going to set you up for a much\nbetter post-menopause a much healthier\npostmenopause and we have to stop\ndefining menopause by your hot flashes\nyou know it may or may not make your hot\nflashes better and we have great\nmedications for that if it's disruptive\nbut I'm talking about your your\ncardiometabolic disease risk I meant to\nask this earlier so forgive me for for\nleaping back briefly but is there any\nvalue in knowing the age at which your\nmother went into menopause as a metric\nor a sensor rather uh for or a as a\nwindow into whether or not you will go\ninto menopause at more or less the same\nage yes there is a of course it's not\none to one we get half of our DNA from\nour fathers so but I always ask and\nthere's a you know the latest data that\nlooked at it genetics is the biggest\nfactor that determines when you're going\nto go through menopause so knowing when\nyour mothers your aunts you know went\nthrough and if there were any medical\nconditions associated with that is huge\nokay so now we're talking not so much\nabout perimenopause but also menopause\nitself what is the typical constellation\nof symptoms as one enters menopause like\nright at the beginning and then does\nthat constellation of symptoms change as\none is you know a year two years three\nyears into menopause so it's almost 100%\nwith body composition changes like very\nvery close you know that visceral fat is\ntough to beat it's beatable but it takes\na lot of work you know do people know if\nthey have visceral fat I mean there's\ntheir scanning approach\ngold you know of course the gold\nstandard is a DEA or even an MRI but no\none can afford that so we have in like\nwhat I have um in my office is the\ninbody scanner so it's electrical\nimpedance scanner and it's it's pretty\ngood so you stand on the scale hold the\nhand I have a medical I have the highest\ngrade one for my patients um and most\npeople doing what I do you know\nutilizing a body scanner use that one um\nbut you can use the waist tip ratio and\nso the waist tip ratio is a better\nmeasure of your risk of metabolic Health\nthan your weight or your BMI so it's so\nsimple you take a tape measure and a\ncalculator you can do it in your head\nbut you measure the smallest part of\nyour waist and if you don't have a small\nwaist if it goes out then just use your\nbelly button just use something you can\nmeasure again are people sucking in or\nare they relaxed you should be relaxed\nand I tell my patients you know do it\nfirst thing in the morning when your\nbladder's empty and you're not bloated\nand you know um and then the widest part\nof your hips it's not perfect but it's\nbetter than your weight or your BMI so\nwidest part of the hips with people feet\nfeet\npeople are going this and so um I only\nknow the data for women so forgive me\nbut um for a female if it's less than\n0.7 then your chance of having\nclinically significant aberration in\nvisceral fat are low and then if it's\ngreater than one you likely have higher\nlevels of visceral fat and so in clinic\nor when I was coaching online for\ngalison diet we were using the waste\nratio as one of the you know measures\nfor their success when measuring the\nwaist um which point along the waist is\nit right at Naval is it it's just\nwherever your smallest so that's kind of\ndifferent for different women so I would\njust say look in the mirror wherever\nyour hourglass goes in is where you want\nto kind of stick to but if you don't\nhave that kind of a waist and you have a\nwider waist just pick the belly button\nbecause you always know you can go back\nto that level you know that's because\nwe're tracking them over time great\nthose are um very useful um\nrecommendations and how often should\npeople do that I you know you should\nnever weigh yourself every day you\nshouldn't do this every day we were\nhaving patients do it or you know our\nfollowers do it once a month so changes\nin body composition as measured by dexa\nor impedance or you don't have access\nthat waste of hip ratio uh what are some\nof the other symptoms of menopause\nfatigue multiple causes for the fatigue\num a lot of sleep disruption um sleep\ndisruption is another huge thing so all\nof a sudden you're struggling to go to\nsleep or you're having middle of the\nnight Awakenings and not able to go back\nto bed that are new and different from\nprev new and different than before right\nI see there was a recent study that came\nout and most of my patients in hindsight\nsay I knew something wasn't right or\nsomething was different something had\nchanged but I couldn't put my finger on\nit and they just had a study come out\nsaying something's then when they looked\nat what that means what does I'm not\nfeeling like myself mean and it was\npsychological changes so you lose\nresilience you're suddenly more\nirritable you're suddenly not able to\nlike go with the punches or or do you\nknow you're you're not adjusting as well\nto change that you used to you're\nsnapping at your kids more your partner\nyou're you know you're you're getting\nfrustrated at work you know it's just\nvery kind of subtle and it takes going\nthrough it and then looking back to say\nyeah I really say may maybe about 47\nthat something was changing and I just\nthought I was just stressed out or\nwhatever and then now I can see that was\nthe beginning of the pattern so\nmenstrual changes as we talked about um\nyou know the big highlights\nvertigo tenus ringing in the ears um\nskin changes so dry skin itchy skin\nfeeling like you're having crawling\nUnder the Skin big gut changes so Nuance\nset bloating you're kind of eating all\nthe same things and your guts just not\nhandling things like it used to so the\nZoe nutrition study took 1100 women and\nand did stool samples through menopause\nthrough the per menopause menopause\ntransition and saw the changes in the\ngut microbiome from the loss of the sex\nhormones and basically we went from what\na typical female microbiome to that of a\nmale through the\ntransition is there any direct evidence\nthat um supplementing the gut microbiome\nand here I don't necessarily mean pills\nand powders I mean um my understanding\nis that getting enough fiber and low\nsugar fermented foods can also support\nthe gut microbiome things like um\nsauerkraut kimchi miso miso um plain\nyogurt just straight up nothing added\nyeah so is there evidence that\nsupporting the gut microbiome can um\nmake this uh stage of menopause more I\nguess um reduce some of the symptoms of\nof menopause so the best I could find\nwas most of them are are done with\nsupplements because those are easier to\nmeasure than handing someone a cup of\nyogurt right and you know which bacteria\nyou're providing so um they did\nlactobacillus and looked and bifido\nbacterium I think and saw that women who\nwere obese and hypertensive in\nmenopausal and they had visceral fat\ndecrease and blood pressure improvements\nversus placebo um also it's hard to do\nPlacebo studies with food you know so\nright um but they do and then in the\nretrospective studies they can look at\ndietary patterns and women who ate rich\nfoods fermented and lots of yogurt you\nknow Mediterranean type diets um have\nbetter symptoms overall what's the\ndifference between the Mediterranean\ndiet and the Galviston diet so so um\nwhen I so I got my culinary medicine\ncertification I was culinary medicine\nyeah so I was frustrated in when I was\nworking because I didn't know anything\nabout nutrition and suddenly like\neverything I was trying to tell my\npatients was based on like the one\nlecture I got in medical school and you\nknow good nutrition was like porn you\nknow it when you see it you know the\nSupreme Court definition of pornography\nand so you know the best I'd ever gotten\nwas the gational diabetic diet and it\nwas this Xerox things with you know was\nin the Deep I was in Texas so it had\nlike tortillas and stuff on it and and\nit had been copied so many times you\ncould barely read it anymore and that\nwas the diet we would that was the only\nnutrition I'd ever like handed to a\npatient and so I'm like eat healthy and\nso I'm like I got to do better than this\nI don't know enough and so we had a\nguest speaker for a Alpha Omega Alpha\nwhich is the Honor Society for medical\nschool and I was one of the advisers so\nand it was this guy Tim Harland who had\nstarted this culinary medicine movement\nand it was basically nutrition for\ndoctors and he velop this like online\nprogram and I had to go to New Orleans\nfor a lab and San Antonio for a lab and\nwork in kitchens where you were learning\nhow to counsel patients how to cook and\nalso basically like getting a little\nminor in nutrition um so it was the best\nthing I've ever done say very cool I\nmean I learned about allergies and like\nall this stuff you know food allergies\nand things that I just didn't know and\njust basic nutritional principles like\nwhat it takes to build a healthy body\nand and what you know I knew about\nquashi oror and like severe deficiencies\nbut not good basic nutrition and so you\nknow they talked heavily about\nMediterranean they talked a lot about\nthe fat diets and stuff but you know the\nprinciples of the Mediterranean I was\nlike I want to teach this to my patients\nbut they're not going to eat a lot of um\nGreek yogurt or they're probably not\ngoing to eat a lot of feta you know like\nhow can I kind of take these blocks and\nmake it more Americanized that was kind\nof like the brain child for me around\ngalison diet was let me like create\nsomething and I really was into fasting\nat the time too so I was like let me put\nthis fasting thing together with you\nknow good nutritional anti-inflammatory\nprinciples and talk about the things we\nknow were probably you should you know\nnot having a whole lot of you know\nprocessed foods and high sugars and\nstuff and and explaining in a way and\nhow it's affecting their menopause and\nlike how can she approach her nutrition\nand that's how Gallison diet was born it\nwas for my patients and then I gave it\nto my girlfriends and then they started\nsharing it and I talked about it one day\non Facebook and the world exploded in\nthe best way in the best way yeah it l\nme here right so right um and we all\nbenefit what is the evidence that\nfasting can be beneficial or detrimental\nto um per menopause menopause so the\njury's kind of still out on that one I\nwas re really liked the data that you\nknow uh I think it was Mark Matson had\ndone on neurodegenerative disease and\nand using fasting as a tool there and\nlowering inflammation levels so I was\nlike this is amazing this is great\nbecause so much about menopause is\npro-inflammatory you know is this\nintermittent fasting so timri he was\nbasically doing 168 you know and uh you\nknow very scheduled intermittent fasting\nand so that was something I was coaching\nmy followers about you know consider\nthis try this this would might be\nsomething to help lower inflammation I\npulled back on that because it's really\nhard to get enough protein in for a lot\nof of women especially if they came in\nat 60 and now I'm telling them to double\ntheir protein you know and then giving\nthem an eight hour window to do it\nthey're like I'm walking around n on a\nchicken breast all day you know this is\nhard right and metabolizing protein is\nits own work right and so you have to\nspread it out throughout the day you\nknow and a lot of that work was done at\nUTMB where I did my underground I mean\nmy residency and where I taught for\nyears and so I was friendly with the\nNutrition department there I was getting\nall excited about everything and they're\nlike you know I went to several of their\nconferences and like talking about\nbreaking up protein intake into nuggets\nthroughout the day because most women\nhave very little protein with breakfast\nmaybe weak gluten in their toast and\nthen have a little bit at lunch and then\nkind of Stack their protein at night and\nthey're still not getting enough but\nthey're overdoing it in their evening\nmeal that's their big protein meal and\nso like teaching them to kind of you\nknow what I was teaching in galison diet\nwas you need to have a healthy fat a\ngood healthy carb and a protein with\nevery meal in snack that you eat you\nknow why do you think that protein has\nnot been\nemphasized um enough until recently I\nthink because we didn't understand it\nyou know we didn't understand how\nimportant muscle was and I mean we knew\nthat protein intake was important for\nmuscle but muscle was for bodybuilders\nand not for women I lived my whole whole\nlife up until about 5 years ago eating\nto be thin and moving to be thin that\nthin was the only measurement of Health\nthat I needed to worry about and what I\ndid was chip away at my bone and muscle\nstrength and thank God I don't have\nosteopenia yet you know i' I've\nhopefully have reversed whatever Trend I\nwas on and I'm naturally low muscle so\nnow it's just a battle to try to hang on\nto what little I have and build some\nresistance train yeah yeah yeah yeah now\nthree days a three days a week three to\nfour days a week yeah resistance\ntraining much less cardio I was running\nmarathons I and it was a great social\nthing with my girlfriends but you know\neverything I did was cardio I taught\nstep aerobics you know the only weights\nI did were maybe in Zumba maybe one or\ntwo pounds you know so and that was\ngreat better than being on the couch I\nmean I loved the community and doing\nthat but you know for me to like stay\nout of the nursing home which was my\nultimate goal for as long as possible I\nneed to pick up some weights and heavy\nweights so that's where my focus has\nchanged isn't it interesting that it\nwasn't until Rec Rec L that um it was\nonly bodybuilders and football players\nand people preparing for military or\nspecific sport would resistance train\nand now we are told that everybody male\nfemale young old should resistance train\nabsolutely probably three times a week\nyeah and the my generation is struggling\nbecause we don't know how to do it and\nso I'm you know and I'm not a personal\ntrainer I don't pretend you know I hire\none to help me develop a program so that\nI don't hurt myself and then I can get\nstronger you know Progressive load so\nyou know and again Dr lion such a huge\nproponent of that and so what I try to\ndo publicly is show my workouts so that\npeople I normalize it and people see me\ndoing it and they're like well she can\ndo it then I can do it it's great super\ninspiring and it really helps uh cross\nthat threshold where people as you said\nthey don't know how it's scary right for\npeople who resistance trained for a long\ntime they go into a gym they they know\nhow all that stuff works but uh for\nthose that don't it's you're wandering\naround like what does this one do you\nknow intimidating for a whole bunch of\nreasons well thank you for putting that\ncontent out um both the uh prescription\nif you will but also the example that\nthat one can go about it so I'm guessing\nif you could go back 20 years you would\nhave started resistance training earlier\nand eating more stronger skinning\nnutrition over calories and and stop\nlooking trying to look a certain way you\nknow you're you're undermining your\nfuture health by doing that I'd like to\ntake a quick break and acknowledge our\nsponsor insid tracker insid tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform that\nanalyzes data from your blood and DNA to\nhelp you better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals now\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth can only be analyzed from a\nquality blood test now a major problem\nwith a lot of blood tests out there is\nthat you get information back about\nmetabolic factors and hormones and\nlipids and so forth but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information with\ninside tracker they make it very easy to\nknow what to do with those numbers\nbecause they have a personalized\nplatform that allows you to see the\nlevels of those metabolic factors lipids\nhormones Etc and they give you specific\ndirectives that you can follow related\nto nutrition behavioral modification\nsupplementation and more that can help\nyou bring those numbers into the

composition changes the\none that we hear about the most for some\nreason I don't know is hot flashes yeah\nso think hot flashes um so in medicine\nwe call it a Vaso motor symptom so we\nhave a a disregulation of the thermo\nregulatory Center in the hypothalamus\nand that that the the thermostat gets\nreset basically and so what happens is\nwe have this vasal dilation of it starts\nin the core typically for most women\nsomewhere in the chest neck area and you\nfeel this heat yeah I can probably\ntrigger one just by talking about it um\nand it it goes up into the neck and out\ninto the extremities and then you just\nstart profusely sweating from all the\nblood vessels dilating and then it can\nlast minutes to a second but for some\nwomen it's preceded by sometimes\npalpitation sometimes by this intense\nfeeling of of dis Foria you know this\nintense sadness feeling and then it and\nthen it just kind of passes but you know\nsay you're you know wherever you are in\nyour life whatever you're doing all of a\nsudden you're just like sweating\nprofusely in the middle of some\nimportant area of your life work you\nknow whatever your jobs are in your life\nand it's disruptive if it happens at\nnight you don't sleep and for some women\nit's severe where they're having\nmultiple ones a day and when any time\nyou disrupt sleep Then daytime is far\nworse regulation you yeah you stress\ndifferently you you know everything\nchanges and so when my patients come in\nthe first questions we ask are sleep and\nthat's the first thing we work on is is\nyou know what can we do to get your\nsleep better what can be done for hot\nflashes aside from the things that\nyou've already described to offset\nmenopause absolute goal standard is\nhormone therapy is like giving your body\nback the estrogen which will readjust\nget your serotonin levels back to where\nthey were and leave that thermal\nregulatory Center alone so it's back to\nwhere it used to be let's talk about hor\ntherapy it's a bit of a controversial\ntopic for no reason yeah I I was going\nto say I don't know why yeah it's\ndemonized it it got such a bad rap and\nwe need to to it's just some of the was\nthe worst misinformation campaign in the\nhistory of medicine well that's a bold\nstatement but I believe you the um the\nway I understand it is that there was\nthis large scale hormone therapy trial\num and the interpretation of that\ntrial was something different than we\nnow believe um as a medical ini so it\nwas really groundbreaking at the time\naging women were finally being studied\nwe knew from observational data that\nwomen on hormone therapy probably 40% of\nthe population of females eligible were\non HRT okay so very large amount so the\nwomen who were given hormone therapy had\nlower incidence of cardiovascular\ndisease older ages of cardiovascular\ndisease lower death from cardiovascular\ndisease some people argued that that was\nan artifact of healthier wealthier women\nget HRT because they go to the doctor\nokay so this is just because they're\nhealthier that they have less\ncardiovascular disease so let's prove it\nwhat do you do that with a randomized\ncontrol trial so flaws in the study so\nthey take I think there were 11,000 is\nwomen in the estrogen only arm because\nthey'd had hysterectomy so for your\nlisteners if you have a uterus and\nyou're getting estrogen you must have a\nprogestogen with it to protect the\nlining of the uterus from minimetro\ncancer as long as you give an adequate\nproest\nyou're fine okay but if you don't have a\nuterus progesterone is not mandatory so\nthe women who had had hysterectomy got\nestrogen only or Placebo and the\nestrogen at the time was primin which\nwas the number one prescription for HRT\nat the time so nothing weird about that\nso it's just um synthetic estrad\nactually no uh primin is is primin\nstands for pregnant mayor urine it is\nactually very natural they take pregnant\nhorses and extract the estrogens from\ntheir urine because they're pregnant and\nthey were screeing a lot of it and it\nwas cheap and easy and I have a lot of\nethical issues about how they do that\nbut and I don't prescribe it but that's\nwhat was done at the time so I I've seen\nhorses urinate they urinate a\nlot there's dozens of estrogens in that\ncomp but the main one is estrad so um\nthen there the other group who had\nuteruses were given Prim Pro which is\nprimin plus\nproa and or Placebo so off we go they\nrecruit 11,000 and then I think 15,000\nin the other arm huge study it was like\na billion dollar study like we're so\nexcited this is happening this started\nwhen I was in med school and then they\nstart recruiting patients and then um\nyou know everyone's taking their meds\nthey excluded women with hot\nflashes what because if your hot flashes\ngo away you know that you didn't get the\nplacebo ah so they excluded one with hot\nflashes problem number one yeah that's a\nbig problem this the end outcome the\nwhat they were trying to measure was\ncardiovascular disease so they started\nwith an older population the average age\nwas\n63 whereas the typical onset of\nmenopause is 51 wow so these women had\nbeen menopausal you know on average for\n10 12 13 years so time away from\nestrogen is when disease starts\naccelerates right okay so put them on\ntheir meds start measuring in the\nestrogen plus progestin arm they saw\na non-statistically significant\nincreased risk of breast cancer and it\nwas this the relative risk relative now\nyou know what this is but your Mone your\nlisteners may not was 25% and and I hope\nI get the numbers right it was four out\nof a thousand women per year to five out\nof a thousand women per\nyear okay so Placebo arm was four so we\nhave breasts we are females we get\nbreast cancer about four out of a th\nwomen per year and that increased to\nfive and the estrogen only arm there was\na 30% decrease risk of of breast cancer\nregardless of the of the average age and\nthey kept that arm going right because\nit's randomized so presumably the\naverage age for the other group is\nroughly 61 as they were match so in\ntheir 60s as well so they call a press\nconference at the Watergate Hotel the\nWatergate Hotel announce the\nfindings they hadn't even published the\ndata yet no one had had a chance to read\nit and these the head researchers called\nthis press conference and say estrogen\ncauses breast\ncancer exogenous estrogen from these\nyeah yes and they said it's a 25%\nincreased risk but the absolute risk was\nlike 8% per\nyear but that didn't get that that's not\na headline thing so on every like ABC\nNBC CBS all the morning shows Nightly\nNews every major magazine it was the\nnumber one medical news story of 2002\nthat that estrogen was bad and it caused\ncancer and da d da the estrogen only arm\nkept going\nand they found after a couple more years\na slightly increased risk of stroke so\nthey stopped the study the effects on\ncardiovascular disease were neutral but\nthere was lower um colon cancer in both\ngroups but no one talked about that so\nthe American Heart Association in 2020\nwent and looked at they looked at ages\nso there were younger women who were\ngiven HRT and what they found was if you\nstarted hormone therapy between the ages\nof 50 to\n59 you had a 50% decreased risk of\ncardiovascular disease and death from\ncardiovascular disease and all cause\nmortality wow so age at which you start\nmatters estrogen so that's where there's\nsomething called the healthy cell\nhypothesis or and so basically estrogen\nis better at prevention than cure and\nit's very protective especially in the\nTima of the coronary arteries so taking\nthat estrogen away we lose that\nprotection once the disease builds up\nthere's some worry that adding estrogen\nonce you've developed a sclerosis or a\nplaque might loosen the plaque\nespecially in that first year so which\nled for some people maybe to have a\nslightly increased risk of stroke so\nwhen my patients come in we are talking\nabout these differences it doesn't mean\nthat after 60 you might not have\ncardiovascular benefit we start losing\nthe benefit so it's the timing\nhypothesis is key and it's the years\naway from estrogen that's the problem\nthere's a great study in the British\nmedical journal they looked\nat years years of reproductive life plus\nHRT and looked at cognition scores and\nsaw that the longer your body is exposed\nto estrogen in any form like whether\nnatural cycles or exogenous estrogen of\nany form and it was estradi in that\nstudy actually then you\nhad higher cognition\nscores healthier brains which had a just\nvery you know top Contour level makes\ntotal sense given that estrogen is\nneuroprotective I realize my not be\nneuroprotective in every instance in\nevery neuron in the brain but it's\ngenerally neur neur protective and\ndecline in estrogen is correlated with\nneur degeneration which does not mean\nit's causal I have to ask when they\nannounced this study at the Watergate\nHotel of all places um and the\nconclusion that they put forth was that\nestrogen therapies can um increase rates\nof cancer\num I have to wonder if that had\nsomething to do with what I understand\nis a sort of party line around Cancers\nand breast cancers in particular which\nis that you want to quote unquote block\nthe estrogen receptor you want to get in\nthere and put give tamoxifen or nowadays\nI'm sure there are other drugs that are\nmore effective to block the estrogen\nreceptor it all seems to um pile up on\nthe side of a story that says you know\nestrogen and estrogen binding to the\nestrogen receptor is proc cancerous\nwhich obviously I think you're telling\nus um in a in a indirect and direct way\nnow and we'll go further into is simply\nnot the case if you take a healthy\nbreast cell and dump it at a petri dish\nand then marinate it with some estrogen\nit's not teratogen I it's not\ncarcinogenic estrogen is not\ncarcinogenic we live with it our whole\nlives if it was in pregnancy for those\nof us who are ever pregnant when our\nestrogen levels Skyrocket we would see\nthis into uptic in breast cancer and we\ndon't in fact I think there's some\nevidence uh for the opposite that\ngetting pregnant prior to age 40 is is\nit true that that's protective against C\nbe somewhat protect for certain forms of\nbreast cancer yeah so we have this whole\ngeneration of Physicians who really\nweren't taught much about menopause\ndon't understand the protective benefits\nof estrogen and and and menopausa effect\non metabolic disease and they have this\nme this mentality of estrogen is bad and\nso a woman walks into her today 2023\nthey looked at the data she goes into\nher doctor complaining of menopausal\nsymptoms which right now are still only\nrecognized as genit urinary syndrome\nmenopause hot flashes night sweats you\nknow the very cliche symptoms\ndocuments in the chart she's having\nwhatever only 10% are offered any\ntherapy and they're most likely four to1\nto be offered an\nanti-depressant that is where it stands\ntoday that is what we are fighting\nagainst is not every woman will choose\nHRT but every woman deserves an informed\nconversation about it and let her make\nher choice you know if you believe the\nWhi data which there are some problems\nthere the risk is small okay but did you\ntalk to her about about cardiovascular\ndisease and diabetes and insulin\nresistance and her cholesterol because\nthose things go up through the menopause\ntransition with no changes in diet and\nexercise and those are all you know\nyou're more even with the diagnosis of\nbreast cancer the most likely thing a\nwoman is going to die\nfrom is cardiovascular disease a heart\nattack or a stroke so framing it like\nthat I think is where we need to head\nand the other thing is you know I was a\ngreat Oben in so many areas of what I\ndid why should this all be dumped in the\nlap of the poor busy OB Jen who's\nrunning around the hospital doing pops\nsmar trying to deliver babies surgery\nand all the things like this should be\nrequired education for all everyone in\nmedical school we are females and we're\nnot little men with breast and uteruses\nwe react differently to medications\ndisease disease burden you know and\nthat's not been studied adequately and\nthat's where the the push needs to go\nit's bigger than just half flashes do\nyou think that one solution is to deepen\nin the medical school curriculum\nabsolutely and more and and I hate\nsaying women's health because everyone\nthinks breast and uterus right and\nreproduction it's the health of\nwomen and we're not addressing it\ndifferently than the health of a man and\nwe're different we you know and so that\nI think is where we need to head given\nthat it's half of the population yeah um\none would imagine that the best thing to\ndo is to make the Core Curriculum of\nmedical students expand to include this\nas opposed to making it a specialty I\nthink so does that mean a fifth year of\nmedical school I'm not kidding I mean I\nI guess maybe I mean people said well\nyou'd have to extend the the OBG in\nresidency I'm like no any any specialist\nwho touches a female should understand\nhow that female I mean the starkest\nexample is cardiovascular disease you\nknow how much longer we have to wait in\nthe Ed how much more likely we are to\ndie in the hospital setting from a heart\nattack because we don't present the same\nsymptoms as men do and it's just the\ndefault has always been how it happens\nto the basic you know really Caucasian\nmale and so at least in the US and so\nbecause we respond differently because\nwe wait longer because our symptoms are\nconsidered to be psychologically induced\nless than biologically induced and so\nwomen are dying at higher rates when you\nlook at the data on\nStatin you get high cholesterol so 80%\nof women will have abnormal cholesterol\nlevels through the minum PO transition\nif they were normal before okay so\nelevated LDL LDL and lowering HDL so now\nthey are at higher risk for\ncardiovascular disease automatically a\nPCP will offer her a Statin okay that is\nstandard of care do you know that the\nAmerican Heart Association published in\n2020 that statins have never been shown\nto decrease their primary heart attack\nin a woman secondary yes but no primary\nprevention and it does not decrease risk\nof death from cardiovascular disease\nthey're know that yeah yet we're routine\nyou know what does\nHRT if given in the right window of\nopportunity how is HRT um in this case\nestrogen HRT given is it a patch is it\ninjections is it great question all the\nabove so we have I like to break it down\ninto oral and non-oral forms so\neverything oral we ingest goes into the\ngut the liver the hepatic system will\npick up the portal vein and take\neverything to the liver for processing\nwhen that bump of estrogen hits the\nliver we can see a slight increase in\nsome of our clotting factors so for that\nreason I tend to go with the non-oral\nformulations to avoid that risk\nespecially if she has any family history\nof clotting or personal history of\nclotting you know we're going to go with\na non-oral form so these are things like\nelevations and Factor 5 lighten MFR if\nshe's had a history of a blood clot we\nare not going with an oral estrogen\nformulation and for people that haven't\nhad a history of a blood clop my\nunderstanding which admittedly is is\nvery um sparse is that you can do a\ngenetic test just by blood draw to see\nwhether or not you have U two normal\ncopies of the of the gene for Factor 5\nlighten um some people are heterozygotes\nso they're more at risk of presumably\nbleeding in that case right um but in\nother\nwords can people go into this knowing\nwhether or not um they're more or less\nat risk from taking estrogen so I don't\nthink that there's a high enough for\nthat reason because we're not routin L\nscreening for these things unless they\nhave a family history I'm going with\nnon-oral estrogen as a primary product\nfor my patients because I can just skip\nthat worry so a patch typically so\ntypically transdermal so a patch there's\neven miss spray there's FDA approved\noptions of a patch there's gels there's\na ring there's a um spray and um there\nis a vaginal ring which I love love love\nbecause it's so you put it in for three\nmonths and it treats you know you get a\ntwo for one you get a local treatment in\nthe vagina as well as a systemic treat\ntreatment as well um it's just really\nexpensive and typically not covered by\ninsurance on the first tier so very few\nof my patients can afford it um there\nare um some injectables which no no one\nin the menop posi uses um there the\nmenop yeah great there are also the mene\nand the menop posi are those terms that\nyou coined I love it um I think I did\nyeah great all right you heard it here\nso the menasi is a a group of healthcare\nprofessionals who are from multiple\nSpecialties we have card ologist\northopedic surgeon um Internal Medicine\nyou Dr lion is a member and we have a\nbig group chat and we all support each\nother we support each other's books and\nresearch and and we send articles back\nand forth and we support each other on\nsocial but we also band it together to\nkind of negate one of the bigger\nPublications on menopause that when the\nlanet published it's a whole another\ndiscussion um but you know we are\nfighting for equity in menopause care\nand and Fe and Women's Health great\nnothing succeeds like a group it's like\nthe old menopause versus the new\nmenopause I love it love it um so\nhormone therapy to increase estrogen how\ndoes it make women feel um\npsychologically physically what are some\nof the positive changes that can OCC\naside from just offsetting some of the\nnegative and I want to make sure that I\nremember to ask what if a woman has been\nin menopause for you know uh has passed\nthat point because as you said it's a\nday so they passed that point um a year\nearlier 2 years earlier 3 years earlier\num given the results of this first study\num which as you explained it are uh\nproblematic and their interpretation the\nway it was interpreted as opposed to\ninitially yeah yeah um what's too long\nshould um women should wom starten\ntherapy in their 40s just in just to you\nknow smooth the transition maybe we need\nmore studies in this area like should we\njust the minute we figure out like I\nwould love like I would glucose monitor\nI have um insulin resistance so for\nthose listening there's just it looks\nlike a little button sized um sticker on\nthe back of the arm I would love to\ndevelop one to track estrogen levels\nstarting your 30s just see where you're\nat you know start seeing are you having\naberations in your cycle and we can\nstart the per menopause journey and\ntalking about should we begin supporting\nI think there's a tremendous amount\nopportunity for research in this area um\nbut typically we are not starting\npatients until they're very symptomatic\nif they're per menopausal or they're\npostmenopausal so in general so if a\nwoman is um in her let's say late\n30s um\nshe is anticipating perimenopause maybe\nis in per menopause and wants to start\nlowd dose um hormone replacement therapy\nI think it's something um worth\nmentioned that not all you know\npresumably the dosages are tailored and\nthen blood so a given dose is tried\nblood is drawn you measure estradi so\nwe're not um we don't have established\nlevels of like therapeutic ranges of\nestradi what we found is that when we do\nthat so far I think we have some\nopportunity here if my level's 50 and\nyour level's 50 I could feel like I'm on\ntop of the world my symptoms are gone\nyou still need more so we are titrating\nfrom symptoms I see yeah interesting\nthat's similar to what is done\nsimilarish with um testosterone\nreplacement therapy which these days um\nyou know I sort of have joke that the\nyou can uh change out the r in\ntestosterone replacement because a lot\nof people are a lot of men are taking\ntestosterone not as a replacement\nmeaning their levels are not lower than\n300 n per deciliter which is kind of\nlower range um they're sort of low\nmiddle and they're trying to get high\nyou know higher range but hormone\nreplacement therapy as I understand it\nhas never been um strictly in men or\nwomen strictly for people who are out of\nrange that it in in theory it can be to\noptimize reduce symptoms and to optimize\nwell-being right um and I don't know if\nthe medical establishment wants it used\nthat way but certainly in the case of\ntestosterone replacement therapy in men\nit's being used that way quite often in\nfact\nso the we don't have established\ntherapeutic ranges for estrad if she's\nPOI premature Varian insufficiency we\nknow we want to get her to 100 or around\n100 or higher in picograms per deciliter\num and but in the menopausal patient\nwe're rarely checking levels but I do\nthink we have an opportunity to learn a\nlot more now that we're able to track\nhow is it how does it affecting your\ncholesterol we need to look at those\nnumbers like what's the optimal dose for\ncholesterol what's the optimal dose for\ncardiovascular disease all we all these\nStudies have looked at was was she on it\nor not so that's where I think the\nopportunities can come so if a woman\ngoes on hormone replacement therapy how\noften is she coming in for blood draws\nor are you just you know well depend\ntestosterone we tend check more often\nthere's we don't have an FDA approved\noption for women for testosterone and so\nno so we either try to get her t- stem\nmhm um or she's finding someone to\ninsert a pellet or something and there's\nthere's other issues with that um what I\ndo in Te Texas it's really hard the\npharmacists do not like to do the t-\nstem for patients and I've even T t-\nstem is the gel you know um and I end up\ncompounding it in a cream and do a\ntransdermal PR for the patients but\nthere's such variable absorption we do\ntend to check more levels of that just\nto may try to get her therapeutic so\nwhat for women at Peak dose is somewhere\nin a healthy female you know 35 to 70\nand it's so so I had a woman coming in\nwith signs of hyperandrogenism you know\nshe's you know deep voice hair growth\nwhatever acne and I'm going to check a\nlevel if it's above 90 for females I\nneed to look for a tumor like that's too\nhigh okay or PCOS it can get that high\ncertainly 200 that's that's outrageous\nso I'm trying to get my patients you\nknow 60 50 70 but if she's like 50 and\nher she's got her libido back and she\nfeels great and everything's wonderful\nthen I'm hold you know because the\nhigher we go the more likely you are to\nhave side effects so you're losing hair\nyou know temporal hair loss voice\nsteepening acne new chin hair you know\nlosing hair where you want it gaining\nhere where you don't want it is how I\nexplain it to patients and so when you\nsay 50 that's 50 nanograms per de\nI think um many people including myself\nwere surprised to learn um that women\nactually have higher levels of\ntestosterone than they do estrogen um\noutside absolute ranges right in\nabsolute ranges and I can tell you right\nnow your natural level of estradiol is\nhigher than mine now I'm I supplement\nbut you know like when I go through\nmenopause your residual estradi is now\nhigher than a postmenopause a woman so\nthis is the uh estrad that I have\nbecause testosterone was aromatized into\ninto EST yeah interesting interesting uh\nso much uh is breaking down around the\nuh the old\nstereotypes female hor like testosterone\nis a human hormone right estrogen's a\nhuman hormone and they exist in in both\nuh biological Sexes yeah it's um it it's\nsometimes unfortunate that compounds in\nthe body get names like steroid hormones\nbecause then people hear steroids and\nthen it has a gravitational pull toward\num anabolic steroid use um or uh even\nthe word fat you know it's like you know\ndietary fat versus subcutaneous fat\nversus fat we need better nomenclature\num to avoid a lot of the confusion that\nexists out there what are some of the\nother hormones that um can be reduced\nand can possibly be replaced by hormone\ntherapy like progestins um you know are\nthere is there a role for um you know\nadjusting things like prolactin or is\nthere a is there a role for other\nhormones in that what sure is to be a\nmultifactorial thing I mean I think\nmenopause is a process not an event\nhypogonadism for females right and so we\nknow that you know because the pituitary\nand hypothalmus are involved and that\nG&R you know there's some cross\nreactivity so for example hypothyroidism\nwhen I have a patient who's on her and\ndoing well on hormone therapy for her\nthyroid so she's on T3 T4 whatever she's\non I'm like listen you know we need to\nrecheck your thyroid levels in six weeks\nbecause giving you back estrogen is\ngoing to mess with a little bit of that\nfeedback cycle so we need to make sure\nyou're still therapeutic so I think\nwe've got more work to do with some of\nthe other hormones um but when we talk\nabout replacement and menopause we are\nmostly looking at your estrogens your\nandrogens and your progesterone so the\nformulations can differ um when we you\nknow there's a lot of misunderstanding\naround what is bioidentical versus\nsynthetic and I think a lot of cottage\nIndustries in this little bubble that we\nhad for 23 years where doctors were\nafraid to prescribe hormone therapy and\nthen women were desperate for care we\nhad some little cottage industries of\npeople I think were well meaning and\ntrying to help but kind of developed\nterminology that really isn't medically\nspecific like estrogen dominance you\nknow and what that really is and so that\nis not a term that is in any medical\njournal it's kind of something coined I\nthink from a well-meaning provider\ntrying to explain what's happening in\nper menopause that you're having more\nproduced than progesterone than you used\nto have so PCO patients do the same\nthing you know there's multiple reasons\nfor that to happen um so when we talk\nabout you know in the miniverse of what\nwe're trying to replace we all agree\nthat we stick pretty much with estradiol\nwe're just trying to give you back the\nwater you were drinking so I want to be\nget as close to what your body used to\nmake because that's what the receptor\nlike I'm trying to give you progesterone\nyou know rather than a synthetic not\nthat they're all demonized progesterone\ndoesn't work for everyone I'm glad I\nhave option\nand then for your androgens we pretty\nmuch just do testosterone and we do a\ntransdermal again because the oral can\nbe hepatotoxic unless it's un8 which\nisn't um available in the US so but in\nthere's no FDA approved option for women\nso it's not covered by\ninsurance we know it works for\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder what\nyour followers would would call libido\num we think we know testosterone women\nat the highest quartile of testosterone\nhave better bone density and stronger\nmuscles so I'm using off label for my\npatients who come in with osteoporosis\nosteopenia or sarcopenia I'm using it\noff label telling them this is a\nprobably a hel it's not a h Mar we think\nit works but we don't have the you know\nit's not approved for that yet yet um we\nknow it has receptors in the brain my\npatients are saying that they're more\nclarity of thought they're sleeping\nbetter they really really like the\ntestosterone um so there's you know DHEA\nthere's a great vaginal preparation for\nDHEA called inosa and then the receptors\nthere will start converting it into to\nboth testosterone and estradi you know\nthrough the process and so um the sexual\nmedicine docs really like in Roa\nespecially for breast cancer patients\nbecause they get that little boost of\ntestosterone in the vulva intr Roa intr\nRoa is the brand name I think it's\nprostone and this is a prescription drug\nyeah these are prescriptions so intr\nroa's prescription DHEA was specifically\nformulated for the vagina got it which\nsits further Upstream to the production\nof testosterone and estrogen right and\nso fortunately\nthe what's left in the vagina is able to\nyou know plug that guy in and get it to\nproduce both testosterone and estrad\nwhich testosterone is the immediate\nprecursor we have to aromatize it right\nto make estrad in females as well these\nlocal effects on tissues um are\ninteresting um I they make perfect sense\nif the highest concentration is at the\nsite of release from the from the patch\nor the gel or the whatever the um the\nthe you said intravaginal what is it\nit's like a capsule uh I think the\nPrestone is a um insert like a little\ngel looking not a gel but a um I forget\nwhat The Binding material is but it's\nlike a little insert you put in okay so\nthe local effects because I guess you\nknow it stands to reason that the\nhighest concentrations can be at the\nsight of the thing that's releasing the\nhormone but then it also goes systemic\nby getting into the blood actually so\nthe the local formulations e the\nprostone and the um the inosa and as\nwell as the estradi formulated for the\nvagina do not absorb Sy ically they're\nso low dose there's not been clinically\nsignificant tissue absorption I have a\nformulation for my face as well so it's\na cream a cream that I put on my face\nit's estriol and so there's some decent\nstudies with estriol but we lose 30% of\nour collagen it's a very big pain Point\nfor women when they go through menopause\nthat we lose so much collagen so quickly\nin the first five years of menopause and\nso we can slow that process down we\ncan't stop it completely we can slow it\ndown by using a topical estrogen and the\ntopical really seems to help with the\nelastin concentrations as well\ninteresting so you you will often\nprescribe a lot of local treatments for\nhormone it's so safe so we can take\nbreast cancer off the table all the\ndiscussion around blood clots and\neverything everyone can use vaginal\nestrogen and they should and I'll tell\nyou why starting at what age relative\ntoop the old menopause thoughts is do\nnot give adinal estrogen until she's\nsymptomatic now all of us will become\nsymptomatic from GSM so that's genital\nurinary syndrome of menopause so from\nthe pubic bone all the way to the sacrum\nall of that tissue is heavily you know\ntied to estrogen testosterone and when\nthose levels decline we see thinning of\nthe tissue loss of elasticity loss of mu\nmucous production as well as the health\nof the urethra and so UTI like the best\ntreatment for recurrent u in a\nmenopausal patient is vaginal estrogen\ninteresting not recurrent antibiotics\nand what about um so it's preventative\nwe can probably keep 50% of women out of\nthe ER and out of urosepsis if we gave\nthem all prophylactic vaginal estrogen\nall these ladies in nursing homes should\nbe on vaginal estrogen so just to\nprotect them from getting Euros sepsis\ninteresting what about um like urinary\nincontinence and some of these other\nsymptoms that are associated with more\nelasticity presumably more elasticity of\nof tissue in that region if you're early\nin a so we have stress incontinance and\nthen we have um overactive bladder urge\nincontinence and so it definitely helps\nwith urgent condet it rela you know it\nhelps to relax and decrease the\ninflammation in the wall of the bladder\nso thumbs up there so people are getting\nup at night and having that urge to go\num but stress incontinence is an\nanatomical problem we've lost you know\nthe the sling that holds up the urethra\nand the female fails right from\nherniation and and poor tissue Health we\ncan build up that health and we you know\nthere's Physical Therapy there's lots of\noptions and you you know no Euro\ngynecologist wants to take a woman to\nthe o to do a\nlift if she's not estrogenized they're\nall going to get vaginal estrogen pre\nyou know through healing and forever to\nkeep the tissue\nhealthy everything that we've been\ntalking about for about the last 15 or\n20 minutes seems to go directly opposite\nthis large scale study that was\ndiscussed at the Watergate Hotel um is\nyour read that the medical establishment\nin particular the OBGYNs in the US and\nin other countries understand now that\nthat study was um flawed to some extent\nin its design no or\nis what we're talking about here like\nreally cutting edge I mean if we were to\ngather a room full of a thousand OBGYN\ntrained in various decades and put there\n10% would have any idea here's why and\nI'm going to call out the American Board\nof Oben directly on this we take our\nboard certification exams every year in\nour specialty as every specialty does\nand they give us a set of Articles of\nThe Cutting Edge newest research and\nit's divided into categories obstetrics\noffice practice Gynecology GYN surgery\nPediatrics onc you know there is no\nmenopause\ncategory\nnothing so I went back over like 10\nyears of all my green journals and\nlooked at how many articles were\nanything to do with menopause and it was\nless than 1% so they were not\nsystematically trying to put the latest\nmenopause information in front of us\nthey don't even recognize the menopause\nsociety as a like entity well now they\nhave to contend with the menop posi they\ndo and because and they might you might\nsee me banned from the a but you know\nwhat no no no but I'm so proud of what I\nlearned I learned amazing things I am a\nboss at delivering a baby of taking care\nof a pregnant patient I am great at\npediatric Gynecology I was so good with\nadolescence where I failed and where\nthis I let the system let me fail was in\nthe care of a woman after reproduction\noutside of surgery outside of her\nsurgical needs well I have to imagine\nthat given the medical profession is\ninterested in the well-being of people\nand in uh for sake of the discussion\ntoday women that um they will be\ngrateful that uh now you you have a\nmicrophone um many microphones uh in\nvarious contexts so uh that is\nsurprising to me however I would think\nthat given the exciting findings around\nhormone replacement therapy and the I'm\nkind of obvious at least when you\ndescribe them to me obvious flaws in\nthese earlier studies of you know\nstarting hormone replacement therapy\nwhen women are already 61 when they've\nalready accumulated um in many cases um\nsome health health issues that uh it\nwould be kind of you miss miss the\nability to to measure the protective\nbenefits so but fortunately we've got\ngreat studies coming out of like the\nDanish data the Scandinavian data that\nare really looking at this again and\nshowing the protective benefits so is it\ngenerally the case that the studies out\nof Europe and Scandinavia are more\nforward W thinking it depends you know\nsome of the most Forward Thinking\nshockingly is um come out of Asia a lot\nout of China and I asked my husband he's\nworked there before and he said there's\nas many researchers in China that are\nfemale as male it's not like they have a\nbig stay-at-home culture you know\nthey're they're not um women are\nexpected to work and they're getting\nphds and they're they're doing the\nresearch and so and he thinks at Le in\nhis in of one you know his humble\nopinion and he's an engineer you know\nthat that's I was like why do you think\nyou've worked over there he goes I think\nbecause there's just as many women who\nare writing the papers as men\ninteresting take I like it um it makes\ngood\nsense what are the various things that\npeople can do in terms of a non hormone\nreplacement therapies that can support\nthem through really into and through\nperimenopause and menopause we talked\nabout nutrition earlier maybe we could\ntouch on that a little bit more we\ntalked about behaviors resistance\ntraining maintaining maybe even\nincreasing muscle mass um there's no\npressure to uh include them but what\nabout the very supplements that we hear\nabout that can touch on or we we are\ntold can touch on these hormone Pathways\nthings like dim things like grape seed\nextracts things like um evening primrose\nI I don't think they're harmful but\nthere's just not robust data to really\nsupport so um menopause Society went and\nlooked at all of them even soy and\neverything and they just outside of\ncognitive behavioral therapy which can\nbe helpful but is not a menopause cure\num they didn't find much in the\nsupplement world that would stop\nremember we're defining menopause as hot\nflashes and general urinary syndrome of\nmenopause so you know when I'm\nrecommending supplements to patients I\ndo think there's some okay data on\nturmeric for maybe hot flashes but I'm\nnot saying to take that instead of\nreplacing the estrogen your body is is\nmissing greatly um I like the\nanti-inflammatory benefits of of you\nknow of that supplement I'm recommending\nF 80% of my patients are deficient in\nvitamin D and struggling to get it\nabsorbed you know um I'm recommending\ncreatine for muscle I'm recommending um\nthere's a specific bioactive collagen\nthat was studied in menopausa one with\nosteoporosis where they saw Improvement\nin bone density so I'm recommending a\nweighted vest great studies elderly\nwomen but saw improvements in bone\ndensity and I'm like why do we wait\nuntil we're osteoporotic to make the\ndiagnosis yeah this is interesting so\nweighted vest a weighted vest they\nlooked at creatine weighted vest\nvibratory training in nursing home\ndwelling so they were kind of a\npopulation where they couldn't go\nanywhere vibratory training is the shake\nplate uh the shake plate and so you know\nanything that stimulates that muscular\nskeletal unit will will send the signal\nto get stronger you know what most women\ndon't realize I mean they know about\nosteoporosis right and they don't want\nto have it but they don't understand\nthat like your habits in your 30s and\n40s are going to put you on that path\nand that your body is going to fight to\nlose muscle and bone naturally through\nthe aging process and accelerated with\nmenopause it doesn't have to be that way\nbut you have to do the work you know and\nand there's some hacks and so I love the\nway to vest for a hack I'm like do the\ndishes with it on go walk the dog you\nknow like like how heavy so you want in\nthe nursing home they started at 10% of\ntheir body weight so I'm like 10 PB 12\nPBS start with that so now my husband's\nobsessed and we have six of them and\nthey go from 8 to 35 lbs you know so I\nhave different weights that I wear like\nif I'm doing leg day I'll put the\nheavier one on so I don't have to hold\nas heavy so you'll use a a weight vest\nwhen you're doing leg day mhm wow so I\ncan't cuz I don't have great grip\nstrength and you know and so it'll help\nme be able to squat heavier you know but\nnow I'm getting better I'm got the bar\ngoing so I'm I'm getting there you know\nI'm want to tell my sister and my mom\nthis yeah and you know I've got my\nsister yeah doing some resistance\ntraining it's been and it's just a cheat\nI'm so it's so cute on social because\nthey'll post and tag me and they're\nwalking their dog and they're doing\nwhatever with their way to vest on and\nnow in galvaston where I live you can't\ngo you see it all over the sea wall\neveryone's walking with their weighted\nbest on I love it and it's hot down\nthere a lot of the year so no excuses\npeople outside of Texas or in Texas for\nthat matter but my experience is that\npeople in Texas don't tend to make\nexcuses anyway that's said like a real\nCalifornian here um we were talking\nabout this a little bit earlier in uh\nfemale specific weight vests I would\nlove to develop one because the ones\nwere made for men and they're okay but\nif you have larger breasts it's hard\nwhere the Snaps are to get it on right\nand I know there's a big Trend with\nWrecking\nbut that puts all the weight on your\nback and I really like the weighted vest\nbecause I feel and this is my opinion\nreally but that you know the reason why\nit's helping with your bone density is\nit's putting the weight on the entire\naxial skeleton rather than just the\nmuscles on your back so we're putting\nthe force more evenly supported yeah um\nand so but some of my uh followers have\nwritten in and said they're struggling\nbecause they have larger breasts and how\nto get this around I'm like I got to\nmake one that's going to accommodate you\nknow have longer you know dist strap\ndown here underneath the breast so\nthat's yeah someone should develop that\nyou should develop that um not that you\ndon't already have enough on your plate\nalready uh along the top I like rucking\nit is sort of backloaded you know by\ndefinition um some of the weight vests\nthat are out there are little um are\nevenly distributed in a way that makes\nthem pretty comfortable they're not all\nloaded up up front like like a a special\noperator or something would wear so I\npositive effects of of the weight vest\nwould be increased bone density you\nyou're doing more burning a little more\ncalories\ngetting stronger but I'm I'm I coach to\nit you know with my followers for this\nis part of my osteoporosis prevention\npack love it are you willing to share a\nfew other things that are in the\nprevention pack uh you know eating\nadequate protein doing resistance\ntraining wearing your weighted vest\ncreatine five grams a day where most of\nthe studies were done in in the women\ncreatine monohydrate monohydrate yeah\nand then um the that cagen consider that\nuh collagen full disclosure I do sell\nthat one but um really good investment I\nthink\nmaybe we could talk about collagen for a\nmoment um it it's a complete protein no\nno no it's missing one I think one or\ntwo amino acids so it's not a complete\nprotein um it's better than none so I do\nlike include my collagen in my protein\nintake for the day because I eat all\nanimal-based protein pretty much um so I\nfigure I'm I'm covered my bases to have\nyou know 10% of it coming with just\nmissing two amino acids or I think it's\none valine I have to look it up so and\nwhat are the specific effects of a\nquality collagen so you know there's a\nlot of controversy there I've seen the\nvideos it is broken down into its\ncomponent amino acids you know through\nthe digestion process but the first ones\nI looked at were totally for vanity I\nwas changing bathing I was trying on\nbathing suits with my daughter who was a\nlittle girl at the time and I was\ncomplaining about the appearance of my\ncellulite even then people have\ncellulite and oh mommy it doesn't look\nthat bad and I you know scientist in me\nwas like goes on PubMed and starts\nlooking up articles on on cellulite and\nhow to decrease the appearance of it and\nso I found these articles on something\ncalled verisol and it was a college in\nmade in Germany and they'd studied\nactually done like really high quality\nstudies like laser measuring wrinkles\nand cellular ger are precise and uh they\nand it looked they had positive outcomes\nI'm like well it won't hurt me so I\nordered some I Googled where do I find\nthis verisol collagen I find this\ncompany I order it and then one day I\ntalked about it on the\ninternet and the company called me and\nsaid would you please let us know when\nyou do that cuz they sold out of their\nsupply for like 3 months so the same\nlike manufacturer of that particular\nverosol made this\nforone did the studies five years doing\nbone density scans on these women it was\na small study but they saw improvements\nwe know what happens to bone density if\nyou do nothing it goes down these went\nup and I thought okay I want to do and I\nwant to offer this to people like if not\nthen me this is a high quality product I\ncan rep you know and that so that's part\nof my um what I offer to people or what\nI recommend you can get it anywhere\nother people sell it not just me great\num\nso I'm perplexed this isn't a challenge\nbut I'm perplexed how would a protein\nthat's not a complete protein um be\nbeneficial for a body organ like skin\nwhereas the complete proteins don't seem\nto do it on their own nobody knows okay\nI don't know interesting are they\nstudying the right thing or they're not\nreally looking at it so I don't know\nthere great when I hear I don't know the\nknow the scientist in me says great area\nfor for exploration because we don't\nreally believe in fact we don't believe\num that amino acids um that are derived\nare derived from a particular body part\nTarget that tissue we've heard this\nargument before um Dr Lane Norton and I\nhave both gone on record publicly saying\nthere is basically zero not basic delete\nthe basically there is zero evidence\nthat when you ingest heart uh let's say\nyou you like eating liver or heart or\nskeletal muscle that somehow the amino\nacids are selectively trafficed to the\norgan uh of the heart or the liver or\nthe skeletal muscle there's no evidence\nof that whatsoever certainly not in\nhumans if there is evidence um I'm sure\nthey'll let us know in the comment\nsection on YouTube and let let us know\nbut yeah it's it's it's perplexing why\ncollagen would have a selectively\nbeneficial effect on skin they didn't\nstudy it versus a steak you know they\njust they just looked at bone density if\nthey took this product every day for 5\nyears and what happened and they weren't\nyou know they weren't having tremendous\ncardi metabolic disease they weren't on\nbone building medications they weren't\non HRT so you know they they did a\npretty clean so there's you know not a\nhuge study but it was interesting and I\nthought okay you know I don't want to\nbreak because if I break my hip well 50%\nof women will have an osteoporotic\nfracture before they die 50% 50 what\nabout men do we know just by way of\ncomparison I think it's 25 wow but don't\nquote me on that I need to look that one\nup so it's it's about half okay and then\nhip fracture if you if you break that\nhip if over the age of 65 you have a\nyour one-year mortality with surgical\nrepair is 30% if you if you're not\nhealthy enough to have the repair you\ncan't afford to have it it's 79 goodness\nso that's what we're trying to avoid is\nthat you know and the tremendous if\nyou've seen the women who have\ntremendous osteoporosis in their spine\nand just how their lives are so hard and\nhow much pain they live in every single\nday you know this a lot of this is\navoidable with aggressive you know being\naggressive and and intentional about\nthis and HRT can be a huge part of that\nas well what I'm about to ask is a\nlittle bit outside the box but I feel um\nFair asking given that um you know I'm\nnot a clinician but I have some\nbackground and certainly understanding\nof neurod degenerative uh conditions of\nthe eye and vision have you ever\nobserved in your patients that when they\nget on hormone replacement therapy for\nmenopause that things that are typically\nassociated with aging like diminished\nvisual function um hearing you mentioned\ntenus also called tentis I understand\nbut tenus I think we'll do both tenus\ncored and said tenus we'll do both um\nhere that that they um they report\nseeing better hearing better and any\nkind of sensory Improvement or offset of\nsensory loss so we know the data is\nclear on dry eye and how that can affect\num but how it affects like the optic\nnerve you know we know that estrogen is\nanti-inflammatory so any kind of like\ninflammatory condition in and around the\neye does tend to get better but we need\nyou know probably more data in this area\nfor hearing most of the research is\naround tenus and vertigo so the the the\nrate of which the crystals break off in\nthe ear accelerates in menopause and\npeople on HRT have less vertigo new\nvertigo than they would have had before\nand I forget what the pathophysiology I\nwrote it in the book but I can't think\nof it right now um what the physiology\nwas behind why tenus increases in um\nmenopause but it's due to the estrogen\nlevels declining you mentioned dry eye a\nlot of people might hear dryeee and\nthink oh no big deal but actually dry\neye is one one of the most frustrating\nthings um to have and it's a uh I\nbelieve a many billions of dollars of a\nyear industry to find treatments for for\ndry eye um so does estrogen replacement\ntherapy improve dry eye it does seem to\nthey have less incidents most of the\nstudies are just retroactive and they're\nlooking at the incident of those things\non women HR on HRT for other reasons are\nnot and they just see especially like\nfrozen shoulders the best data there I\nthink and um what they see is a\ndecreased risk of occurrence and then if\nthey do have it they have a shorter\nduration and easier cour you know easier\nto treat if they're on HRT fantastic so\num what are some of the cases where uh a\nwoman can't or shouldn't do hormone\nreplacement therapy and here we're using\nhormone replacement therapy is kind of a\nproxy for for estrogen therapy yeah so\nany hormone sensitive cancer a one of\nthe things a lot of women don't\nunderstand if you have dysfunctional\nuterine bleeding that has not been\nevaluated you should not start hormone\ntherapy because we don't know if it's\ncancer so if you're having really heav\nespecially if they're heavy bleeding\nclots out of nowhere you know something\nunusual about the volume or the the\nfrequency of your bleeding you need to\ngo see a gynecologist and get that\nevaluated before you start hormone\ntherapy okay it may not be anything\ncancerous or tumorous it might just be\nthe hormone changes but that needs to be\nevaluated um if known breast cancer no\nif you're actively having a blood clot\nthat you're being treated for they're\nsaying let's hold off until that therapy\nis\nover um even if you've had a hormone\nsensitive cancer including breast cancer\ndepending on the stage the type and and\nit's a very nuanced conversation does\nnot mean that you automatically\ndisqualified for hormone therapy after\nyour\ntreatment so that is one of the biggest\nmisconceptions out there if you have\nreally severe liver disease I'm not\ntalking about mild fatty liver disease\nlots of menopausal women have that and\nit does tend to get better with HRT if\nyou have severe liver disease that is\nwhere estrogen begins to be metabolized\nand so you could have abnormal\nmetabolism you don't want that so that\nyou're that's going to keep you from\nbeing a\ncandidate why do you think we're seeing\nor at least hearing about in my case uh\nPCOS polycystic ovarian syndrome so much\nmore is it because people are aware is\nit because I think two reasons one the\nObesity epidemic had led to more PCOS\nthat is definitely a risk factor for for\nyou know insulin resistance is usually\nthe the main pathophysiologic cause\nbehind PCOS and I a PCOS then PCOS\nsufferer so I had it my whole\nreproductive life um both but you're not\nobese at all no no they missed it\nforever I was just stressed out medical\nstudent which can potentially cause PCOS\nwith acne yeah I mean you you can have\nPCOS is a symptom of something\nbiologically a barent turns out I'm\ninsulin resistant which is why you know\neven though I'm thin and so we've had\nhigher increasing levels of obesity\nwhich is a risk factor for that also\npeople are talking about about it and\nthat writing books about it Karen Tang\njust published um it's not Hyster wait\nhysteria it's uh it's not hysteria and\nshe's a gynecologic surgeon does a lot\nof work around enetri so she has like\nhuge chapters on PCOS and how to\nadvocate for yourself and you know all\nabout the disease process so people\nunderstand interesting what what are\nsome of the primary treatments for PCOS\nis it going to be blocking androgens so\nyes and so for me you know in all my\ntraining it was always put them on birth\ncontrol because it w it it will suppress\novulation and suppress the over\nproduction of androgens in their system\nso I was a very happy birth control\npatient because I was thin for the obese\npatients if we can help them lose weight\nit does tend to they start ovulating\nagain and so now with the new go 1s a\nlot of PCOS will probably resolve itself\nand they'll start ovulating again and go\nback to normal Cycles that's the\npregnancies that are happening from G\nones I see so glp1 associated1 babies\nyeah gp1 we saw a surge of that when all\nthe patients the obese patients were\ngetting the gastric bypasses then they\nget pregnant and so we were advising\nthem to not be pregnant until their\nweight was stable for a year after\nsurgery because of the medical\nimplications of nutrition and pregnancy\nbut they were going to you know they\nwere so excited and CED and now their\nlibido's up and and they're you know\ngetting pregnant and um never really\nneeded contraception before and just\nassum they'd still have trouble and so\nnow they're ovulating and getting\npregnant and we're seeing the same thing\nwith gop1 so I'm anyone listening out\nthere who's prescribing a gop1 please\ntalk to your female patients about\ncontraception if they don't want to be\npregnant very interesting and um\nadmittedly uh unforeseen uh implications\nof glp1 as long as we're there um what\nare your thoughts onic monjaro um I\nthink that they can be a really\nimportant tool for a lot of patients I\ndon't think they're for everyone I don't\nthink people are being counseled\nadequately a lot of them I mean in my\narea outside of Galveston where I live\nthere are Med Spas giving out GOP ons\nand as far as I can tell they're just\ngiving them the meds and sending them\nout the door I've had patients coming in\non it who were never counseled about the\npotential for muscle loss so when I look\nat a patient's health I look at a\n30-year plan right and so they come in\nwith a lifelong history usually of of\nhaving a weight problem and a fat\nproblem and and here's this medication\nthat's going to take the food noise away\nand help them focus on the habits that\nare going to keep them healthy longer so\nI do have patients that I've prescribed\nit to we have a very long discussion\nabout adequate protein intake resistance\ntraining you know I have a a way to\nmeasure their muscle mass we are\ntracking that every month for them every\nmonth to six weeks while they're you\nknow on the medication so women who are\non HRT with the glp1 have a 30%\nincreased weight\nloss wow yeah yeah I appreciate that you\nmentioned that the use of OIC monjaro is\nnot mutually exclusive with resistance\ntraining and improved nutrition the way\nit shows up on social media sort of like\npeople assume well you know you gotta\ntake great care of yourself and exercise\nwell great but there are also a number\nof people that are carrying excess\nweight to the point where um they are at\nrisk of injury when they exercise um I\nmean everyone's at risk of injury when\nthey exercise but what I'm hearing is\nthat you basically take the view\nwhatever can get people in a kind of\nforward Center of mass around management\nof blood insulin levels Etc cuz wasn't\nthat the original FDA approval\ndiabetes diabetes um and there's also\nsome dat I recall that OIC monjaro can\nreduce alcohol cravings that so yeah the\nreward center in the brain are the the\nnoise so they're looking now I guess\nthat my friends who are like obesity\nMedicine Specialists and are all like\nreading every study that comes out any\nkind of impulsive behavior or\nreward-seeking behavior gaming gambling\nalcohol you know people are tending to\ndo less of those behaviors because\nwhatever the whatever is being blocked\nin the brain and you know more about\nthis than I do seems to help with that\nthose drives that's interesting that the\nhypothalamus is uh choca block full of\nneurons associated with all sorts of\ndrives and temperature regulation you\nmentioned earlier you know the preoptic\narea of the of the hypothalamus involved\nin temperature regulation and we've\nalways viewed those as somewhat separate\nbut they're actually um quite\ninterconnected and and so I'm not\nentirely surprised that uh a drug that\nwould reduce cravings for food might\nalso reduce cravings for other things\nit's going to be really interesting to\nsee um what the science and the animal\nmodels and human shows us over time it's\ndefinitely happening I mean this is has\nit hit a trillion dollar industry yet\nit's probably hundreds of billions of\ndollar know the majority of big F\nresearch and funding is is being\nfunneled into this um maybe not all for\nthe right reasons but the the Obesity\nMedicine Specialists who are kind of who\nI turned to for how do how do I do this\nhow do I do it right\num how do I not hurt someone just to get\nthem to lose weight you know and are\nvery excited because these new levels\nthey say it's like the iPhone 12 the\niPhone 13 like they're just going to get\nbetter and better with Lower Side\nEffects better profiles you know as time\ngoes on that we're going to look back at\nthe mjo and these earlier meds and be\nlike oh my God what were we doing you\nknow because of the side effects well if\nnothing else there very interesting to\npay attention to because it's uh clearly\nuh in the cultural Zeitgeist right now\nso every once in a while when a guest\nfor whom the topic is of immense\ninterest coming on the podcast I'll put\nout a call on social media for questions\nand so uh if you're willing I'd like to\njust ask you a few of the audience\nquestions um and U we can treat these as\nrapid fire or um as much depth as you\nlike um first off that many of the\nquestions you've already answered things\nlike um what the role for testosterone\nreplacement therapy in women um as\nopposed to just estrogen replacement\ntherapy but one of the more common\nquestions in here that uh We've touched\non but I think could um uh deserve a bit\nmore attention is you know if a woman is\nin her 60s and has already gone through\nmenopause is it appropriate for her to\nconsider or at least just talk to her\ndoctor about hormone replacement therapy\nor she putting herself at risk there's\ndefinitely worth the conversation so if\nI have a patient who comes in and she\nshe's she's more than 10 years passed\nher menopause or over the age of 60 and\nhas not been on\nHRT then we start looking at risk\nfactors for cardiovascular disease or\nstroke and so we're looking at her blood\npressure her lipids her you know\ncholesterol and triglycerides and\nlooking for things that are going to put\nher at higher risk she's lost probably\nthe maximum cardiovascular benefit but\nwe don't want to put estrogen on top of\nsevere atherosclerotic disease so if she\nhas abnormal cholesterol I'm going to\nsend her for a calcium cardiac score I\nwant to see if there's calcified plaques\naround her heart I may even if if stroke\nis a risk we may even Cent her for an\nultrasound you know looking at the\nintimal thickness um of the kateed so if\nthose are normal or lowrisk then we will\ntalk about the benefits of what what\nwould the benefits be for her after the\nage of 60 will we probably lost the best\nof the cardiovascular protection but it\nwill always protect her bones it will\nalways protect her genital urinary\nsystem it will always protect her skin I\nmean there's things that estrogen will\ndo for us forever and so and then let\nher make the decision certainly if she's\nstill symptomatic meaning hot flashes or\nthings we can easily identify that we\nknow estrogen will help with but you\nknow that first tenear window is kind of\ncritical for the preventative benefits\nbut it doesn't mean she's not going to\nbenefit forever now when do we stop used\nto be doctors make up numbers three 10\nyears whatever if she's been on it since\nearly in her menopause and has not\ndeveloped any of these diseases and she\nwants to keep going we're going to keep\nher on I will probably die with my\nestradiol patch on if I don't develop a\nreason to take it off because I know\nit's protecting me in so many levels and\nI want to keep that\ngoing in so many ways it sounds very\nsimilar to testosterone replacement\ntherapy and Men the ideas that people go\non why you stop at 70 why would you do\nthat right you know if you didn't\ndevelop a contraindication to it very\nclear and um potentially very actionable\nanswer thank you um a number of the\nquestions related to um the relationship\nbetween menopause hormone therapy and\nmental health mental well-being um but\nlet's just keep it simple for now and\nask what are the things that women can\ndo in order to um optimize or their\nmental health in per menopause and\nmenopause and that they can do to offset\nany mental health issues that might\narise during per menopause and menopause\nand there's a reason why I asked about\nthose two things separately one is just\nto very different than menopause for\nmental health so a great question so I\njust went to a menop posium menopause\nconference in\nChicago and uh there was a whole section\non mental health and it was uh\nneuroscientist psychiatrists and and\nmenopause Specialists all up there\ndiscussing the latest data it was so f\nfascinating and so there really is a big\ndifference as far as mental health for\nwhat's happening in per menopause and\nwhat's happening postmenopause and as we\ntalked about earlier in per menopause we\nhave that hormonal zone of chaos and we\nsee this you know in the Australian data\nit's a four times risk of mental health\ndisorders especially\ndepression and then in\npostmenopause a lot of these things tend\nto stabilize or get better probably\nbecause just the estrogen is bottomed\nout and the brain is not having to deal\nwith these fluctuations\nso we think that the data is looking\nlike the best treatment for the mental\nhealth issues in per menopause is going\nto be\nestrogen for stabilization and not the\ntraditional ssris snris you know the\nanti-depressants and the anxiety meds\nnot incidentally uh one of the more\ncommon questions was um in this case\nvery specifically worded I've been on\nHRT for 5 years and I'm 61 I feel great\nbut how long as it quote unquote okay to\nbe on them seems like I hear conflicting\nopinions well we just heard a very\nstraightforward opinion from you so\nthank you for that as long as you want\nto be as long as you're still\nhealthy how can I stop waking up in the\nmiddle of the night this is a problem\nsince entering menopause MH so we see\nsleep disruptions definitely from not\nonly from the vasomotor symptoms which\nwill wake you up okay if we can get\nthose under control you know your sleep\nfunction should not be affected by that\nwhat we're seeing though is people even\nwith HRT even with estrogen are still\nhaving middle of the night Awakenings or\nracing thoughts or having they get up to\npee or something in the middle of the\nnight and they can't go back to bed\nusually because their brain is is going\non what we found is that progestin\nprobably through the effects of Gaba is\nvery effective at settling your brain\ndown and allowing for sleep so I'm\nhaving my patients take their\nprogesterone Orly at night before they\ngo to bed and we're seeing better sleep\nwith that and that was also something\ncovered in detail I was so excited by\nthe neuroscientist that's part of her\narea of research that they are showing\nclearly and she can point to the neuro\nreceptors of where that's happening that\nprogesterone seems to be really\nprotective for our sleep now take\nhormones off the table sleep hygiene is\nstill hugely important and I need to see\nthe studies to prove it but I'm telling\nyou we do not tolerate alcohol like we\ndid Prem menopausal women are in at\nleast 90% every time I post about it\nonline I see thousands of comments of I\nquit I had to give it up I cannot sleep\nand even in my own life if I choose\nsocially to have more than a glass of\nwine I am giving up sleep like it is a\nchoice I'm choosing not to sleep that\nnight I will wake up 2:23 3:35 whatever\ntime in the morning sweating and I'm\nlike you know too much champagne at New\nYear's or whatever so you know that is a\nchoice and it's something I counsel my\npatients about like you probably can't\ntolerate alcohol like you used to aging\nis a factor here our body composition\nchanges and there's probably something\nhormonally that's going on we don't\nunderstand yet but like you choose this\nyou're going to choose not to sleep more\nthan likely interesting I wonder whether\nor not um estrogen modulates the alcohol\ndehydrogenase enzyme but uh time hav't\nseen the data yet but I'm sure it's\ncoming here's an interesting One how can\nmen help their female loved ones\nnavigate these stages yeah you get that\nquestion a lot my and it's it's great\nand it always comes on the when I'm\nbeing interviewed by a male you know\nwhen I'm interviewed by a female they're\nwonderful but they they have their own\nexperience and they have to talk about\nit and that's fine that's my job you\nknow is women have to unpack their\nmenopause trauma to me but the men are\njust so curious and just have so many\nquestions and then how can I support a\npartner and or my mom or whomever in my\nlife who's who's dealing with this one\nis is acknowledge that this is happening\nand and try to educate yourself there's\nmy book other books there's lots of\ninformation now on the internet about\nthe subject but she is going through a\ntransition that is in her world more\nthan likely and is affecting her brain\nher bones her heart her kidneys her skin\nher ability to relate her ability to\ntolerate it's probably going to affect\nyour relationship in some way go there\nwith her go to the appointments with her\nbe there to advocate for her you know be\na partner through this with her because\nyou will get her back but it's going to\ntake you know changing the way that you\naddress things a couple of questions\nabout quote how to rekindle libido oh\nyeah this person in particular says it's\npacked bags and moved out since I\nstarted menopause they're reporting\ntheir individual experience but um you\ntouched on testosterone therapy earlier\nany woman\nin her menopause Journey at any time\nthere's a 50% sexual dysfunction rate\nmeaning she's not happy with whatever is\ngoing on now when we look at the buckets\nwhere sexual function fall into we have\norgasmic disorder now in menopause when\nwe lose blood flow to the area people\ncan have delayed orgasms or less um the\npeak of the orgasm is lower you know\nless vibrant orgasms for lack of a\nbetter word um they have decreased blood\nflow to the area they lose elasticity so\npain is another bucket you know it hurts\nthe skin gets torn it's very fragile\nit's very Frable so vaginal estrogen\ntherapy can help there there is arousal\ndisorders where you want to do it but\nthe blood's not getting where it needs\nto go so you're not having all the\narousal type symptoms so sometimes\nViagra selenophile topical selenophile\ncan be helpful there there and but the\nmost common thing that women have is hsd\nor of course relationship disorder you\ndon't love your partner you don't feel\nsupported it's going to be hard to you\nknow relationship disorder official the\nofficial term so but then hsdd is\nhypoactive sexual desire disorder that's\nin the brain and so first thing I ask is\ndid you use to have a good libido or a\ndrive yes you know and you have a good\nrelationship with your partner it\ndoesn't hurt you we have to rule out the\nother things that's where testosterone\ncomes into play that that is those\npatients it does tend to help there are\ntwo FDA approved medications for libido\none is VII it's an injection you give\nyourself and actually works for men as\nwell about 30 minutes before it's in the\nalpha melany stimulating hormone path\nmordon and then there is um Addie addyi\nworks at the level I think of dopamine\nin the brain so it's more in the family\nof ssris that you know so it affects\nneurotransmitter and so you take that\nevery day um and it works it was only\nstudied in premenopausal women but it\ndoes you know it's modest but it does\nseem to have an effect so but most of my\npatients\nbecause testosterone has so many other\nbenefits you and then the the cost the\nto get it compounded in Texas is maybe\n30 bucks a month so it's really\nreasonable um and the V and the atti can\nbe very expensive and usually not\ncovered by insurance so because of cost\nand and potential other effects most of\nmy patients choose testosterone if it's\nhsdd I see this is a question about the\num side effects associated with estrad\nhormone replacement therapy in this\nparticular instance um the person says\num what are the best alternatives to\nestrad I've tried tiny amounts and the\nside effects in this case um skin rashes\nand hives are what they are describing\nso I wonder if it's the patch so um\nthere's a certain percentage of patients\nwho it's not the estradiol it's actually\nthe adhesive in the patch they will have\na reaction to it so one is try an\nalternative form another thing that one\nof the members on my team saw in her her\nchat group is they get the flon so\ncorticon nasal spray over the counter\nand they spray it on and let it dry then\nthey put the patch on and it decreases\nthe risk of the reaction to the glue um\nI don't know how if that lasts forever\nbut I thought that was a cool thing to\nknow about and um but what I typically\ndo for my patients is change them to an\nalternative form interesting um thank\nyou for that they went on to ask about\num trying a new supplement called equil\nEQ u e l e about that one again I don't\nknow what's an equil um but again not\nreally robust studies but most of these\nthings are not harmful but you may just\nit may be a little snake oil you know\nthrowing your money away really the\nthing that's going to fix the problem\nfor most women is restoring your estr\nyeah because there were other questions\nabout you know wild yam and and things\nmore in the supplement um space um as\nwell as things like acupuncture and\nherbal medicine so um acupuncture can\nreally be helpful\num but again it's it's hard to access\nand can be expensive for a lot of\npatients and it's not treating the root\nCA but it definitely can help you deal\nwith some of the symptoms and make you\nmore comfortable and then um last\nquestion um how best to attack and here\nI'm quoting attack the fat distribution\nproblem at this time yeah uh you need a\nmultifactoral approach to visceral fat\nso nutrition exercise women on HRT have\nless visceral fat you know um those are\nkind of the key things and and the way\nyou approach your nutrition with the\nexercise with the stress reduction\ngetting those cortisol leveled down are\ngoing to make you healthier in every\nother way as well great well Dr Mary CLA\num thank you so much for giving us just\na wealth of knowledge about per\nmenopause menopause really explaining\nwhat those are clearly um for the first\ntime on this podcast and really\nillustrating the things that people can\ndo to think about these stages of life\nand to to I don't know if I should say\ntackle or to dance with the stage of\nLife whatever um term one prefers in\norder to offset the negative effects and\nit sounds like in fact it's very clear\nbased on what you've told us that there\nare real levers of control yeah\nincluding hormone replacement therapy\nbut other things as well\nnutrition exercise um sounds like when\nwe put all these together there's almost\nlike a mindset around per menopause and\nmenopause that you are um promoting um\nwhich is one of of real agency that this\nis not something that is um going to\nbury us mentally and physically that's\nsomething that really can be worked with\nand I just want to say
