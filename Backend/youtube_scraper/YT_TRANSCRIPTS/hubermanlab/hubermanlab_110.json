    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Matthew McDougall Dr Matthew\nMcDougall is the head neurosurgeon at\nneurolink neurolink is a company whose\ngoal is to develop Technologies to\novercome specific clinical challenges of\nthe brain and nervous system as well as\nto improve upon brain design that is to\nimprove the way that brains currently\nfunction by augmenting memory by\naugmenting cognition and by improving\ncommunication between humans and between\nmachines and humans these are all of\ncourse tremendous goals and neurolink is\nuniquely poised to accomplish these\ngoals because they are approaching these\nchallenges by combining both existing\nknowledge of brain function from the\nfields of Neuroscience and neurosurgery\nwith robotics machine learning computer\nscience and the development of Novel\ndevices in order to change the ways that\nhuman brains work for the better today's\nconversation with Dr Matthew McDougall\nis a truly special one because I and\nmany others in science and medicine\nconsider neurosurgeons the astronauts of\nNeuroscience in the brain that is they\ngo where others have simply not gone\nbefore and are in a position to discover\nincredibly novel things about how the\nhuman brain works because they are\nliterally in there probing and cutting\nstimulating Etc and able to monitor how\npeople's cognition and behavior and\nspeech changes as the brain itself has\nchanged structurally and functionally\ntoday's discussion with Dr McDougall\nwill teach you how the brain works\nthrough the lens of a neurosurgeon it\nwill also teach you about neuralink\nspecific perspective about which\nchallenges of brain function and disease\nare immediately tractable which ones\nthey are working on now that is as well\nas where they see the future of\naugmenting brain function for sake of\ntreating disease and for simply making\nbrains work better\ntoday's discussion also gets into the\nrealm of devising the peripheral nervous\nsystem in fact one thing that you'll\nlearn is that Dr McDougall has a radio\nreceiver implanted in the periphery of\nhis own body he did this not to overcome\nany specific clinical challenge but to\novercome a number of daily everyday life\nchallenges and in some ways to\ndemonstrate the powerful utility of\ncombining novel machines novel devices\nwith what we call our nervous system and\ndifferent objects and Technologies\nwithin the world I know that might sound\na little bit mysterious but you'll soon\nlearn exactly what I'm referring to and\nby the way he also implanted his family\nmembers with similar devices so while\nall of this might sound a little bit\nlike science fiction this is truly\nscience reality these experiments both\nthe implantation of specific devices and\nthe attempt to overcome specific\nmovement disorders such as Parkinson's\nand other disorders of deep brain\nfunction as well as to augment the human\nbrain and make it work far better than\nit ever has in the the course of human\nevolution are experiments and things\nthat are happening now at neuralink Dr\nMcDougall also generously takes us under\nthe hood so to speak of what's happening\nat neurolink explaining exactly the\nsorts of experiments that they are doing\nand have planned how they are\napproaching those experiments we get\ninto an extensive conversation about the\nutility of animal versus human research\nin probing brain function and in\ndevising and improving the human brain\nand in overcoming disease in terms of\nneurosurgery and neural links goals by\nthe end of today's episode you will have\na much clearer understanding of how\nhuman brains work and how they can be\nimproved by Robotics and engineering and\nyou'll have a very clear picture of what\nneural link is doing toward these goals\nDr McDougall did his medical training at\nthe University of California San Diego\nand at Stanford University School of\nMedicine and of course is now at\nneurolink so he is in a unique stance to\nteach us about human brain function and\ndysfunction and to explain to us what\nthe past present and future of brain\naugmentation is really all about before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast our first sponsor is\nhvmn Ketone IQ hvmn Ketone IQ increases\nblood ketones I want to be very clear\nthat I like most people have heard of\nthe ketogenic diet but I like most\npeople do not follow a ketogenic diet\nthat is I'm not in ketosis however most\npeople don't realize that you can still\nbenefit from increasing your blood\nketones which is what hvmn Ketone IQ\ndoes I take Ketone IQ prior to doing\nreally focused cognitive work so I take\nit once in the afternoon anytime I'm\ngoing to prepare for a podcast or do a\npodcast or if I'm going to do some\nresearch or focus on a grant anything\nthat requires a high level of cognitive\ndemand and that's because ketones are\nthe brain's preferred use of fuel even\nif you're not following a ketogenic diet\nif you'd like to try Ketone IQ you can\ngo to hvmn.com huberman to save 20 off\nyour order again that's hbmn.com\nhuberman to save 20 today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by levels levels is a\nprogram that lets you see how different\nfoods and activities affect your health\nby giving you real-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose monitor\nnowadays there's a lot of excitement\nabout continuous glucose monitors and\nlevels allows you to assess how what you\neat and what combinations of foods you\neat and exercise and sleep and things\nlike alcohol should you indulge in\nalcohol and things of that sort how\nthose impact your blood glucose now it's\nvery important that the cells of your\nbody and in particular the cells of your\nnervous system not experience levels of\nblood glucose that are too high or too\nlow so-called hyperglycemia or\nhypoglycemia what levels allows its\nusers to do is to understand how their\nspecific routines food intake patterns\nexercise Etc impact their blood sugar\nlevels I like most people who use levels\nfind that there's a lot to learn and a\nlot to be gained by understanding these\nblood glucose patterns if you're\ninterested in learning more about levels\nand trying a continuous glucose monitor\nyourself you can go to levels.link\nhuberman right now levels is offering an\nadditional two free months of membership\nagain that's levels.link l-i-n-k\nhuberman to get two free months

literally means smart drugs and the\nbrain has neural circuits for focus it\nhas neural circuits for creativity as\nneural circuits for task switching it\ndoes not have neural circuits for quote\nunquote being smart\nthesis understands this and has designed\ncustom nootropics Each of which is\ndesigned to place your brain and body\ninto a specific State ideal for a\nparticular type of work or physical\neffort such as creativity or Focus or\nClarity if you'd like to try thesis\nnootropics you simply go to their\nwebsite you fill out a brief quiz and\nthey will design a custom starter pack\nso that you can assess which things work\nfor you more or less well and then\nthey'll iterate with you over the course\nof the next few weeks or months to come\nup with the ideal

McDougall\nwelcome good to be here nice to see\nAndrew great to see you again uh we'll\nget into our history a little bit later\nbut just to kick things off\nas a neurosurgeon and as a\nneuroscientist can you share with us\nyour vision of the brain as an organ as\nit relates to what's possible there I\nmean I think most everyone understands\nthat the brain is along with the body\nthe seat of our cognition feelings our\nability to move Etc and the Damage there\ncan limit our ability to feel the way we\nwant to feel or move the way we want to\nmove but\nsurgeons tend to view the world a little\nbit differently than most because as the\nnot so funny joke goes you know they\nlike to cut and they like to fix and\nthey like to mend and they in your case\nhave the potential to add things into\nthe brain that don't exist there already\nso how do you think about and\nconceptualize the brain as an organ and\nwhat do you think is really possible\nwith the brain that most of us don't\nalready probably think about yeah that's\na great question\nthinking about the brain as this three\npound lump of meat trapped in a prison\nof the skull\nit seems almost magical that it could\ncreate a you know human a human set of\nbehaviors and a life\nmerely from electrical impulses when you\nstart to see patients and see say a\nsmall tumor eating away at a little part\nof the brain and see a very discrete\nfunction of that brain go down in\nisolation you start to realize that the\nbrain really is a collection of\nfunctional modules pinned together duct\ntaped together\num in this in this bone box attached to\nyour head\num and sometimes you see very\ninteresting failure modes so one of the\nmost\nmemorable patience I ever had was very\nearly on in my training I was down at UC\nSan Diego and saw a very young guy who\nhad just been in a car accident we had\noperated on him and you know as is so\noften the case in neurosurgery we had\nsaved his life\npotentially at the cost of quality of\nlife\nwhen he woke from surgery with bilateral\nfrontal lobe damage he had essentially\nno\nimpulse control left and so\nyou know we rounded on him after surgery\nsaw that he was doing okay to our you\nknow first guess at his uh health and we\ncontinued on to see our other patients\nand we were called back by his you know\n80 year old recovery room nurse saying\nyou've got to come see your patient\nright away something's wrong and we walk\nin to see him and he points at his\nelderly nurse and says she won't have\nsex with me\nand you know it was Apparent at that\nmoment his frontal lobes were gone and\nthat person is never going to have\nreasonable human behavior again\num\nand uh that's you know it's one of the\nmost tragic ways to have a brain\nmalfunction but uh you know anything a\nbrain does anything from control of\nhormone levels in your body to Vision to\nsensation to you know the most obvious\nthing which is muscle movement of any\nkind from eye movement to moving your\nbicep all that comes out of the brain\nall of it can go wrong any of it any\npart of it or all of it\num\nso yeah working with the brain is the\nsubstance of the brain as a surgeon very\nhigh stakes but you know once in a while\nyou get a chance to really help you get\na chance to fix something that seems\nunfixable and you have you know\nlazarus-like Miracles not not too\nuncommonly so it's extremely satisfying\nas a career\ncould you share with us one of the more\nsatisfying experiences or perhaps the\ntop Contour of what um qualifies as\nsatisfying in in neurosurgery yeah\num you know one of the relatively newer\ntechniques that we do is you know if\nsomeone comes in with a reasonably small\ntumor somewhere deep in the brain that's\nhard to get to the traditional approach\nto taking that out would involve cutting\nthrough a lot of good normal brain and\ndisrupting a lot of neurons a lot of\nwhite matter that you know kind of the\nwires connecting neurons\num then the modern approach involves a\ntwo millimeter drill hole in the skull\ndown which you can pass a little fiber\noptic uh cannula and and uh attach it to\na laser and just heat the tumor up deep\ninside the brain under direct MRI\nvisualization in real time so your this\nperson is in the MRI scanner you're\ntaking pictures every second or so as\nthe tumor heats up you can monitor the\ntemperature and get it exactly where you\nwant it where it's going to kill all\nthose tumor cells but not hurt hardly\nany of the brains surrounding it and so\nnot uncommonly nowadays we have someone\ncome in with a tumor that previously\nwould have been catastrophic to operate\non and we can eliminate that tumor with\nyou know leaving a poke hole in their\nskin\nwith almost no visual After Effects so\nthat procedure that you just described\ntranslates into better clinical outcomes\nmeaning fewer let's call them side\neffects or collateral damage exactly\nright yeah we don't you know even in\ncases that previously would have\nconsidered totally inoperable say a\ntumor in the brain stem or a tumor in\nprimary motor cortex or primary verbal\nareas Brokers area\nuh where we would have expected to\neither not operate or do catastrophic\ndamage those people sometimes now are\ncoming out unscathed\nI'm very curious about the sorts of\nbasic information about brain function\nthat can be gleaned from these clinical\napproaches of lesions and\num strokes and um maybe even stimulation\nso for instance in your example of this\npatient that had bilateral frontal\ndamage\nwhat do you think his lack of Regulation\nreveals about the normal functioning of\nthe frontal lobes because I think the\nobvious answer to most people is going\nto be well the frontal lobes are\nnormally\num\nlimiting impulsivity right but as we\nboth know because the brain has\nexcitatory and inhibitory neurons to\nsort of accelerators and breaks on\ncommunication right that isn't\nnecessarily the straightforward answer\num it could be for instance that the\nfrontal lobes are acting as conductors\nright and are kind of\num important but not the immediate\nplayers in determining impulsivity so\num two questions really what do you\nthink the frontal lobes are doing\nbecause I'm very intrigued by this uh\nhuman expanded real estate we have a lot\nof it compared to other animals and more\ngenerally what do you think damage of a\ngiven neural tissue\nmeans in terms of understanding the\nbasic function of that tissue yeah it\nvaries I think from tissue to tissue but\nwith respect to the frontal lobes I\nthink they act as sort of a filter they\nselectively are saying\nbackward to the rest of the brain behind\nthem\nwhen part of your brain says that looks\nvery attractive I want to go grab it and\ntake it you know out of the jewelry\ndisplay case or you know whatever\nthe frontal lobes are saying\nyou can if you go pay for it first right\nthey're filtering the behavior they're\nthey're letting the impulse through\nmaybe uh but in a controlled way\num this is very high level very broad uh\nthinking about how the frontal lobes\nwork and that\nthat patient I mentioned earlier is a\ngreat example of when they go wrong you\nknow he had this impulse sort of strange\nimpulse to be attracted to his nurse\nthat normally it would be easy for our\nfrontal lobes to say this is completely\ninappropriate wrong setting wrong person\nwrong time\nuh\nin his case he had nothing there and so\neven the slightest inclination to uh to\nwant something came right out to the\nsurface so\num yeah a filter calming the rest of the\nbrain down from acting on every possible\nimpulse when I was a graduate student I\nwas um running what are called you know\nthese uh what these are but just to\ninform you what are called acutes which\nare\num neurophysiological experiments that\nlast several days because at the end you\nuh you terminate the animal this isn't\nuh my apologies to those that um are\nmade uncomfortable by animal research I\nnow work on humans so a different type\nof animal but at the time we were\nrunning these acutes that would start\none day and maybe end two or three days\nlater and so you get a lot of data the\nanimals anesthetized and doesn't feel\nany pain the entire time of the surgery\nbut the um one consequence of these\nexperiments is that the experimenter me\nand another individual are awake for\nseveral days with an hour of sleep here\nan hour of sleep there but you're\nbasically awake for two three days\nsomething that really I could only do in\nmy teens and 20s I was in my 20s at the\ntime and I recall\num going to eat at a diner after one of\nthese experiments and I was very hungry\nand the waitress walking by with a tray\nfull of food for another table\nand it took every bit of self-control to\nnot get up and take the food off the\ntray something that of course is totally\ninappropriate and I would never do and\nit must have been based on what you just\nsaid that my forebrain was essentially\ngoing offline or offline from the sleep\ndeprivation right because there was a\nmoment there where I thought I might\nreach up and grab a plate of food\npassing by simply because I wanted it\nright and um I didn't\num but I can relate to the experience of\nfeeling like the shh response is a\nflickering in and out under conditions\nof sleep deprivation so do we know\nwhether or not sleep deprivation limits\nfor brain activity in a similar kind of\nway you know I I don't know specifically\nif that effect is more pronounced in the\nforebrain as opposed to other brain\nregions but it's clear that sleep\ndeprivation has broad effects all over\nthe brain people start to see visual\nhallucinations so the opposite end of\nthe brain as you know the visual cortex\nin the far back\nthe brain is affected people People's\nCourt motor coordination goes down after\nsleep deprivation so\num I think you know if I if you force me\nto give a definitive answer on that\nquestion I'd have to guess that the\nentire brain is affected by sleep\ndeprivation and it's not clear that one\npart of the brain is more effective than\nanother\nso we've been talking about damage to\nthe brain and inferring function from\ndamage uh maybe we could talk a little\nbit about what I consider really the\nHoly Grail of the nervous system which\nis neuroplasticity this incredible\ncapacity of the nervous system to change\nits wiring strengthen connections weaken\nconnections maybe new neurons but\nprobably more strengthening and\nweakening of connections right nowadays\nwe hear a lot of excitement about\nso-called classical psychedelics like\nLSD and psilocybin which do seem to\nquote unquote open plasticity they do a\nbunch of other things too but\num through the release of\nneuromodulators like serotonin and so\nforth\nhow do you think about neuroplasticity\nand more specifically\nwhat do you think the potential for\nneuroplasticity is in the adult so let's\nsay older than 25 year old brain\nwith or without\nmachines being involved because\num in your role at neurolink and as a\nneurosurgeon in other clinical settings\nsurely you are using machines and surely\nyou've seen plasticity in the positive\nand negative direction right\nwhat do you think about plasticity\nwhat's possible there without machines\nwhat's possible with machines so as you\nmentioned or alluded to the plasticity\ndefinitely goes down in older brains\nuh it it is harder for older people to\nlearn new things to make radical changes\nin their behavior uh to you know kick\nhabits that they've had for years\num\nmachines aren't the obvious answer so\nimplanted electrodes and computers\naren't the obvious answer to increased\nplasticity necessarily compared to\ndrugs we already know that there are\npharmacologics some of the ones you\nmentioned psychedelics that have a broad\nimpact on plasticity yeah it's hard to\nknow which area of the brain would be\nmost potent as a stimulation Target for\nan electrode to broadly juice plasticity\ncompared to uh you know pharmacologic\nagents that we already know about\nI think with plasticity you're talking\nin general you're talking about the\nentire brain you're talking about\naltering you know a trillion synapses\nall in a similar way in their tendency\nto be rewireable to their tendency to be\nup or down weighted and\nan electrical stimulation Target in the\nbrain necessarily has to be focused you\nknow with a device like potentially\nneural links there might be a more broad\nability to steer current to multiple\ntargets with some degree of control but\nyou're never going to get that broad\num Target ability with uh\nany electrodes that I can see coming in\nour lifetimes so say that would be\ncoding the entire surface and depth of\nthe brain the way that a drug can and so\nI think plasticity research will bear\nthe most fruit when it focuses on\npharmacologic agents I wasn't expecting\nthat answer given that you're at neural\nlink and um and then again I think that\nall of us me included need to take a\nstep back and realize that while we may\nthink we know what is going on at\nneurolink in terms of the specific goals\nand the general goals and I certainly\nhave in mind I think most people have in\nmind a chip implanted in the brain or\nmaybe even the peripheral nervous system\nthat can\ngive people super memories or some other\naugmented capacity we really don't know\nwhat you all are doing there and for all\nwe know um you guys are taking or\nadministering psilocybin and combining\nthat with stimulation I mean we really\ndon't know and I say this\num with a with a tone of excitement\nbecause\num I think that one of the things that's\nso exciting about the different\nEndeavors that Elon has really\nspearheaded\num SpaceX Tesla Etc is that early on\nthere's there's a lot of Mystique right\nyou know Mystique is a quality that\num is not often talked about but\num it's I think a very exciting time in\nwhich\nEngineers are starting to toss up big\nproblems and go for it and obviously\nElon is\ncertainly among the best if not the best\nin terms of going really big I mean Mars\nseems pretty far to me right electric\ncars are all over the road nowadays are\nvery different than the picture a few\nyears ago right when you didn't see so\nmany of them\nrockets and so forth and now the brain\nso\nto the extent that you are allowed could\nyou share with us what your vision for\nthe missions at neurolink are and what\nthe general scope of missions are and\nthen\num if possible uh share with us some of\nthe more specific goals I can imagine\nbasic goals of trying to understand the\nbrain and augment the brain I could\nimagine clinical goals of trying to\nrepair things in humans that are\nsuffering in some way or animals for\nthat matter yeah it's it's funny what\nyou mentioned uh\nneuralink and I think Tesla and SpaceX\nbefore it end up being these blank\ncanvases that people project their hopes\nand fears onto and so we we experience a\nlot of upside in this people you know\nassume that we have superpowers in our\nability to alter the way brains work and\npeople have terrifying fears of the\nhorrible things we're going to do\nuh for the most part those extremes are\nnot true uh you know we are making a\nneural implant we have a robotic\ninsertion device that helps Place tiny\nelectrodes the size uh smaller than the\nsize of a human hair all throughout a\nsmall region of the brain in in the\nfirst indication that we're aiming at we\nare hoping to implant a series of these\nelectrodes into the brains of people\nthat have had a bad spinal cord injury\nso people that are essentially\nquadriplegic they have perfect brains\nbut they can't move use them to move\ntheir body they can't move their arms or\nlegs because of some high-level spinal\ncord damage exactly right and so this\nyou know pristine motor cortex up in\ntheir brain is completely capable of\noperating a human body it's just not\nwired properly any longer to a human's\narms or legs and so our goal is to place\nthis implant into a motor cortex and\nhave that person be able to then control\na computer so a mouse and a keyboard as\nif they had their hands on a mouse and a\nkeyboard even though they aren't moving\ntheir hands their motor intentions are\ncoming directly out of the brain into\nthe device and so they're able to regain\ntheir digital freedom uh and connect\nwith the world through the internet\nwhy use robotics to insert these chips\nand the reason I asked that is that sure\nI can imagine that a robot could be more\nprecise\nor less precise but in theory more\nprecise than the human hand no tremor\nfor instance right\num uh more Precision in terms of uh\nmaybe even a little micro detection\ndevice on the the tip of the blade or or\nsomething that could detect a capillary\nthat you would want to avoid and swerve\naround that the human eye couldn't\ndetect and you and I both know however\nthat no two brains nor are the two sides\nof the same brain\nidentical right so navigating through\nthe brain is perhaps best carried out by\na human however and here I'm going to\ninterrupt myself again and say\n10 years ago face recognition\nwas very clearly performed better by\nhumans than machines and I think now\nmachines do it better right so is this\nthe idea that eventually or maybe even\nnow robots are better surgeons than\nhumans are in in this limited case yes\nuh these electrodes are so tiny and the\nblood vessels on the surface of the\nbrain so numerous and so densely packed\nthat a human physically can't do this a\nhuman hand is not steady enough to grab\nthis you know couple Micron width Loop\nuh at the end of our electrode thread\nand place it accurately uh blindly by\nthe way into the cortical surface\naccurately enough at the right depth to\nget through all the cortical layers that\nwe want to reach\nand\nI would love if human surgeons were you\nknow essential to this process\nbut very soon humans run out of motor\nskills sufficient to do this job and so\nwe are required in this case to lean on\nrobots to do this incredibly precise uh\nincredibly fast incredibly numerous\nplacement of electrodes into the right\narea of the brain so in some ways\nneurolink is pioneering the development\nof robotic surgeons as much as it's\npioneering the exploration and\naugmentation and treatment of human\nbrain conditions right and as the device\nexists currently as we're submitting it\nto the FDA it is only for the placement\nof the electrodes the the robot it's\npart of the surgery I or or another\nneurosurgeon still needs to do the you\nknow the more crude part of opening the\nskin and skull and presenting the\nrobotic pristine brain surface to sew\nElectric threads into\nwell surely getting quadriplegics to be\nable to move again or maybe even to walk\nagain is a um heroic goal and one that I\nthink everyone would agree would be\nwonderful to accomplish is that the\nfirst goal because it's hard but doable\nright\num or is that the first goal because you\nand Elon and other folks at neurolink\nhave a passion for getting paralyzed\npeople to move again yeah broadly\nspeaking you know the mission of\nneuralink is to reduce human suffering\nat least in the near term you know\nthere's hope that eventually there's a\nuse here that makes sense for a brain\ninterface to bring AI as a tool embedded\nin the brain that a human can use to\naugment their capabilities I think\nthat's pretty far down the road for us\nbut definitely on a desired roadmap in\nthe near term we really are focused on\npeople with terrible medical problems\nthat have no options right now\nwith regard to motor control\nyou know our mutual friend recently\ndeparted Krishna shenoy was a giant in\nthis field of motor prosthesis it just\nso happens that his work was\nfoundational for a lot of people that\nwork in this area including us and he\nwas an advisor to neuralink\num that work was farther along than most\nother work for addressing any function\nthat lives on the surface of the brain\nthe physical constraints of our approach\nrequire us currently to focus on only\nsurface features on the brain so we\ncan't say go to the really\num\nvery compelling surface deep depth\nfunctions that happen in the brain like\nyou know mood appetite addiction pain\nsleep we'd love to get to that place\neventually but in the immediate future\nour first indication or two or three\nwill probably be brain surface functions\nlike motor control\nI'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag1 is\na vitamin mineral probiotic drink that\ncovers all of your foundational\nnutritional needs I've been taking\nathletic green since 2012 so I'm\ndelighted that they're sponsoring the\npodcast the reason I started taking\nathletic greens and the reason I still\ntake athletic greens once are usually\ntwice a day is that it gets to be the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health\nour gut is very important it's populated\nby gut microbiota that communicate with\nthe brain the immune system and\nbasically all the biological systems of\nour body to strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 so for\nthose listening the outer portions of\nthe brain are\nfilled with or consist of rather\nneocortex so the the bumpy stuff that\nlooks like sea coral some forms of sea\ncoral look like brains or brains look\nlike them and then underneath uh reside\na lot of the brain structures that\ncontrol what Matt just referred to um\nthings controlling mood hormone output\nhow awake or asleep the brain is\num and would you agree that those deeper\nregions of the brain have in some ways\nmore predictable functions I mean that\nlesions there or stimulation there lead\nto more predictable outcomes in terms of\ndeficits or improvements in function\nyeah in some way yes I mean the the\ndeeper parts of the brain tend to be\nmore stereotyped as in more similar\nbetween species than the the outer\nsurface of the brain they're kind of the\nfirmware or the the housekeeping\nfunctions to some degree body\ntemperature blood pressure sex\nmotivation\nhunger or things that you don't really\nneed to vary dramatically between a fox\nand a human being\nwhereas the the outer more reasoning\nfunctions of problem-solving functions\nbetween a fox and a human are vastly\ndifferent and so the physical\nrequirements of those brain outputs are\ndifferent\nI think I heard Elon describe it as the\nhuman brain is I'm essentially a monkey\nbrain with a super computer placed on\nthe outside which\num sparked some interesting ideas about\nwhat neocortex is doing we have all this\nbrain real estate on top of all that\nmore stereotyped function type stuff in\nthe deeper brain and it's still unclear\nwhat neocortex is doing in the case of\nfrontal cortex as you mentioned earlier\nit's clear that it's um providing some\nquieting of of impulses some context\nsetting rule setting context switching\nall of that makes good sense but then\nthere are a lot of cortical areas that\nsure involved in Vision or touch or\nhearing but then there's also a lot of\nreal estate that just feels un\nunexplored right so I'm curious whether\nor not in your clinical work or work\nwith neural link\num or both whether or not you have ever\nencountered neurons\nthat do something that's really peculiar\nand intriguing\num and here I'm referring to examples\nthat could be anywhere in the brain yeah\nlike where you go wow like these neurons\nwhen I stimulate them or when they're\ntaken away lead to something kind of\nbizarre but interesting yeah yeah\nthere's\num the one that comes immediately to\nmind is unfortunately in a terrible case\nin kids that have a tumor in the\nhypothalamus that lead to what we call\ngelastic seizures which is sort of an\nuncontrollable fit of laughter there's\nbeen cases in the literature where this\nlaughter is so uncontrollable and so\npervasive that people suffocate from\nfailing to breathe where they laugh\nuntil they pass out\nand so you know you don't normally think\nof a deep structure in the brain like\nthe hypothalamus as being involved in\nthe you know a function like\nhumor and and certainly when we think\nabout this kind of laughter in these\nkids with tumors it's\nmirthless laughter is the the kind of\ntextbook phrase\nhumorless laughter it's just a reflexive\num almost\nzombie-like behavior and\nit comes from a very small population of\nneurons deep in the brain this is one of\nthe other sort of strange\nloss of functions you might say is you\nknow it's it's nice that you and I can\nsit here and not have constant uh\ndisruptive fits of laughter coming out\nof our bodies but that that's a neuronal\nfunction that's you know thank goodness\ndue to neurons properly wired and\nproperly functioning and any neurons\nthat do anything like this can be broken\nand so we see this in horrifying cases\nlike that from time to time\nso I'm starting to sense that there are\ntwo broad bins of approaches to\naugmenting the brain either to treat\ndisease or for sake of increasing memory\ncreating super brains Etc one category\nyou alluded to earlier which is\npharmacology and you specifically\nmentioned that the tremendous power that\npharmacology holds right whether or not\nit's through psychedelics or through\nprescription drug or you know some other\ncompound\nthe other approach are these little\nmicroelectrodes that are extremely\nstrategically placed right into multiple\nregions in order to play essentially a\nconcert of electricity that is exactly\nright to get a quadriplegic moving\num\nthat Sparks two questions first of all\nis there a role for and is neural link\ninterested in combining pharmacology\nwith stimulation\nso not immediately right now we're\nsolely focused on the extremely hard\nsome might say the hardest problem\nfacing humans right now of decoding the\nbrain through electrical stimulation and\nrecording that's that's enough for us\nfor now so um to just uh give us a bit\nFuller picture of this you were talking\nabout a patient who can't move their\nlimbs because they've have spinal cord\ndamage right\num the motor cortex that controls\nmovement is in theory fine right you\nmake a small hole in the skull and\nthrough that hole a robot is going to\nplace electrodes\nobviously motor cortex but then where\nhow is the idea that you're going to\nplay a concert from different locations\nyou're going to hit all the keys on the\npiano in different combinations and then\nfigure out what can move the limbs what\nI'm alluding to here is I still don't\nunderstand how the signals are going to\nget out of motor cortex past the lesion\nand into\num and out to the limbs because the\nlesion hasn't been dealt with at all in\nthis scenario so just to clarify there I\nI\nshould emphasize we're not in the\nimmediate future talking about\nreconnecting the brain to the patient's\nown limbs that's on the road map but\nit's way down the road map a few years\nwhat we're talking about in the\nimmediate future is having the person be\nable to control electronic devices\naround them with their motor intentions\nalone right so prosthetic hand and arm\nor just Mouse and and keys on a mouse\nand keys on a keyboard for starters so\nyou wouldn't see anything in the world\nmove\nuh as they have an intention the patient\nmight imagine say flexing their fist or\nmoving their wrist and what would happen\non the screen is the mouse would move\ndown and left and click on an icon and\nbring up their word processor and then a\nkeyboard at the bottom of the screen\nwould allow them to you know select\nletters in sequence and they could type\nthis is the easy place to start easy in\nquotes I would say because\num the transformation of electrical\nsignals from motor cortex through the\nbrain stem into the spinal cord and out\nto the muscles is somewhat known right\nthrough 100 years or more of incredible\nlaboratory research right but the\ntransformation meaning how to take the\nelectrical signals out of motor cortex\nand put it into a a mouse or a robot arm\nthat's not a trivial problem I mean that\nthat's a whole other set of problems in\nfact well we're taking we're unloading\nsome of that difficulty from uh from the\nthe brain itself from the brain of the\npatient and putting some of that into\nsoftware so we're using smarter\nalgorithms to decode the motor\nintentions out of the brain we have been\nable to do this in monkeys really well\nso we have you know a small army of\nmonkeys playing video games for you know\nsmoothie rewards and they do really well\nwe we actually have the world record of\na bit rate of information coming out of\na monkey's brain to you know\nintelligently control a cursor on a\nscreen we're doing that better than\nanyone else\nand you know again thanks in no small\npart due to Krishna shenoi and his you\nknow his lab and the people that have\nworked for him that have been helping\nneuralink\num but what you can't do with that\nmonkey is ask him what what he's\nthinking you can't ask him we can ask\nhim but he won't get a very interesting\nanswer yeah\nyou can't tell him to try something\ndifferent you can't tell him to hey you\nknow try their shoulder on this early\ntry the other hand and see if there's\nsome cross body uh neuron firing that\nthat gives you a useful signal once we\nget to people\nwe expect to see what they've seen when\nthey've done similar work in academic\nLabs which is the the human can work\nwith you to vastly accelerate this\nprocess and get much more interesting\nresults so one of the things out of out\nof Stanford recently is\nthere was a lab that with Krishna and\nJamie Henderson and other people decode\nspeech out of the hand movement area in\nthe brain so what we know is that there\nare\nyou know multitudes of useful signals in\neach area of the brain that we've looked\nat so far they just tend to be highly\nexpressed for say hand movement in the\nhand area but that doesn't mean only\nhand movement in the hand area\nokay so here's the confidence test\nthere's a long history\nuh dating back really prior to the 1950s\nof scientists doing experiments on\nthemselves sure\nnot because they are Reckless but\nbecause they want the exact sorts of\ninformation that you're talking about\nthe ability to really understand how\nintention and awareness of goals can\nshape outcomes in biology if that is\nvague to people listening what I mean\nhere is that for many probably hundreds\nof years if not longer scientists have\ntaken the drugs they've studied or\nstimulated their own brain or done\nthings to really try and get a sense of\nwhat the animals they work on or the\npatients they work on might be\nexperiencing psychiatrists are sort of\nfamous for this by the way right I'm not\npointing fingers at anybody but\npsychiatrists are known to try the drugs\nthat they administer right and some\npeople would probably imagine that's a\ngood thing just so that the clinicians\ncould have empathy for the sorts of side\neffects and not so great effects of some\nof these drugs that they administer to\nto patients but\nthe confidence test\nI present you is\nwould you be willing or are you willing\nif allowed to have these electrodes\nimplanted into your motor cortex yeah\nyou're not a quadriplegic right you can\nmove your limbs yeah but\ngiven the state of the technology at\nneurolink now\nwould you do that or maybe in the next\ncouple of years if you were allowed\nwould you be willing to do that yeah and\nbe the person to say hey turn up the\nstimulation over there I feel like I\nwant to reach for the cup right with\nthat robotic arm but I'm feeling kind of\nsome resistance because it's exactly\nthat kind of experiment done on a a\nperson who can move their limbs and who\ndeeply understands the technology and\nthe goals of the experiment that I would\nargue actually stands to advance the\ntechnology fastest sure as opposed to\nputting the electrodes first into\nsomebody who\num is imperative a number of levels and\nthen trying to think about why things\naren't working right right and again\nthat you know this is all with the the\ngoal of of reversing paralysis in mind\num but would you implant yourself with\nthese microelectrodes yeah absolutely I\nI would be excited to do that I think\nfor the first iteration of the device it\nprobably wouldn't be very meaningful it\nwouldn't be very useful because I can\nstill move my limbs and our first\noutputs from this are things that I can\ndo just as easily with my hands right\nmoving a mouse typing in a keyboard\num we are necessarily making this device\nas a medical device for starters for\npeople with bad medical problems and no\ngood options\nit wouldn't really make sense for an\nable-bodied person to get one in the\nnear term\nit as the technology develops and we\nmake devices specifically designed to\nperform functions that can't be done\neven by an able-bodied person\nsay eventually refine the technique to\nget to the point where you can type\nfaster with your mind and one of these\ndevices than you can with text to speech\nor speech to text and your fingers\nthat's a use case that makes sense for\nsomeone like me to get it it doesn't\nreally make sense for me to you know get\none when it allows me to you know use a\nmouse slightly worse than I can with my\nhand currently that said the safety of\nthe device I would absolutely vouch for\nfrom you know the hundreds of surgeries\nthat I've personally done with this I I\nthink it's much safer than many of the\nindustry standard FDA approved surgeries\nthat I routinely do on on patients that\nyou know are no one even thinks twice\nabout their standard of care neurolink\nis already reached in my mind a safety\nthreshold that is far beyond a commonly\naccepted safety threshold\nalong the lines of augmenting one's\nbiological function or functions in the\nworld I think now's the appropriate time\nto talk about the small lump uh present\nin the top of your hand for those\nlistening not watching there's a it\nlooks like a a small lump between\num\nDr mcdougall's forefinger and thumb or\nindex finger and thumb\num placed on skin on the top of his hand\nyou've had this for some years now\nbecause we've known each other for gosh\nprobably seven years now or so and\nyou've always had it in the time that\nI've known you what is that lump\num and why did you put it in there yeah\nso it's a small writable RFID tag what's\nan RFID what does RFID stand for yeah\nradio frequency identification and so\nit's just a very small implantable chip\nthat wireless devices can temporarily\npower if you approach an antenna they\ncan power and send a small amount of\ndata back and forth so most phones have\nthe capability of reading and writing to\nthis chip for years it it let me into my\nhouse it unlocked a deadbolt on my front\ndoor\nfor some years it unlocked the doors at\nneuralink and let me through you know\nthe the various locked doors inside the\nbuilding\num\nit is writable I can write a small\namount of data to it and so for some\nsome years in early uh the early days of\ncrypto I had a crypto private key\nwritten on it to store a cryptocurrency\nthat I thought was you know a dead\noffshoot of one of the main uh crypto\ncurrencies after it forked and so I put\nthe private wallet key on there and\nforgot about it and remembered a few\nyears later that it was there and went\nand checked and it was worth you know a\nfew thousand dollars more than when I\nhad left it on there so that was a nice\nfinding change in the sofa in the 21st\ncentury and then when you say you read\nit you're essentially taking a a phone\nor other device and scanning it over the\nthe lump in your hand so to speak and\nthen it can read the data from there\nyeah essentially yeah um what other\nsorts of things could one put into these\nrfids in theory and how long can they\nstay in there before you need to take\nthem out and um yeah and recharge them\nor replace them well these are passive\nthey're coded in\nbiocompatible glass and as an extra I'm\na rock climber and so I was worried\nabout that glass shattering during rock\nclimbing I additionally coated them in\nanother ring of silicone before\nimplanting that so it's it's pretty safe\nthey're passive there's no battery\nthere's no Active Electronics in them so\nthey could last the rest of my life I\ndon't think I'd ever have to remove it\nfor any reason you know at some point\nthe technology is always improving so I\nmight remove it and upgrade it\nthat's not inconceivable already there's\nyou know 10x more storage versions\navailable that could be a drop in\nreplacement for this if I ever remove it\nbut you know that it it has a small\nNiche use case and it's an interesting\nproof of concept tiptoeing towards the\nconcept that you mentioned of you know\nyou have to be willing to go through the\nthings that you're suggesting to your\npatients in order to you know say with a\nstraight face that you think this is a\nreasonable thing to do\nso a small subcutaneous implant in the\nhand is a little different than a brain\nimplant but yeah what's involved in\ngetting that RFID chip into the hand is\nit I'm assuming it's an outpatient\nprocedure presumably you did it on\nyourself yeah yeah this was a kitchen\ntable kind of procedure\num any anesthetic or is or no you know I\num I've seen people do this with\nlidocaine injection I for my money I\nthink a lidocaine injection is probably\nas painful as just doing the procedures\na little cut in that thin skin on the\ntop of the hand right some people are\ncringing right now other people are\nsaying I want one because you'll have to\nnever worry about losing your keys yeah\nor passwords I actually would like them\nfor passwords because I'm dreadfully bad\nat uh remembering passwords I have to\nput them in places uh all over the place\nand then it's like I'm like that kid in\num remember that movie Stand by me where\nthe kid hides the pennies under the the\nporch and then uses the map yeah spends\nall summer trying to wind them so I can\nrelate uh yeah so a little it was just a\nlittle slit and then put in there no\nlocal immune response no no pus no\nswelling all the materials are\ncompletely biocompatible that are on the\nsurface exposed to the body so no no bad\nreaction it healed up you know in days\nand it was fine very cool um since we're\non video here maybe can you just uh\nmaybe raise it and show us yeah so so\nwere you not to point out uh that little\nlump I I would have known to to ask\nabout it but and uh any other members of\nyour family have have these a few years\nafter having this and seeing the\nconvenience of me being able to open the\ndoor without keys uh my wife insisted\nthat I put one in her as well so she's\nwalking around with one fantastic we\nconsider them our sort of our our\nversion of wedding rings love it well\ncertainly um more permanent than wedding\nrings in in some sense\num\nI can't help but ask this question even\nthough it might seem a little bit off\ntopic as long as we're talking about\nimplantable devices and Bluetooth and\nRFID chips in the body I get asked a lot\nabout\num the safety or lack thereof of a\nBluetooth headphones\num you work on the brain you're a brain\nsurgeon\num that's valuable real estate in there\nand um you understand about\nelectromagnetic fields and sure\num any discussion about emfs immediately\nputs us in the category of uh oh like\nget their tin foil hats and yet I've\nbeen researching emfs for a future\nepisode of the podcast sure and emfs are\na real thing that's not a valuable\nstatement everything's a real thing at\nsome level even an idea but there does\nseem to be some evidence that\nelectromagnetic fields of sufficient\nstrength can alter the function of maybe\nthe health of but the function of neural\ntissue given that neural tissue is\nelectrically signaling among itself so\num I'll just ask this in a very\nstraightforward way do you use Bluetooth\nheadphones or wired headphones yeah\nBluetooth and you're not worried about\nany kind of EMF Fields across the skull\nno I mean I I think the energy levels\ninvolved are so tiny that uh you know\nionizing radiation aside we're way out\nof the realm of ionizing radiation that\npeople would worry about you know tumor\ncausing EMF Fields\neven just the electromagnetic field\nitself\nas is very well described in a Bluetooth\nfrequency range the power level are tiny\nin these devices and so you know we are\nAwash in these signals whether you use\nBluetooth headphones or not for that\nmatter you're you're getting bombarded\nwith ionizing radiation in a very tiny\namount no matter where you live on earth\nunless you live under huge amounts of\nwater\num it's unavoidable uh and so I think\nyou just have to trust that your body\nhas the DNA repair mechanisms that it\nneeds to deal with the constant bath of\nionizing radiation that you're in uh as\na result of being in the universe and\nexposed to cosmic rays\nin terms of electromagnetic fields there\nit's just it's uh\nyou know the energy levels are way way\nout of the range where I would be\nworried about this what about heat\num you know I don't use the earbuds any\nlonger for a couple of reasons once as\nyou know I take a lot of supplements and\nI reach into my left pocket once and\nswallowed a handful of supplements that\nincluded a Bluetooth a airpod pro\num I knew it I swallowed it the moment\nafter I\ngulped it down by the way folks please\ndon't do this it was not a good idea it\nwas it wasn't an idea it was a mistake\nand but I could see it on my phone as\nregistering there never saw it again so\nI'm assuming it's no longer in my body\nbut um uh anyway there's a bad joke\nthere to be sure\num but in any event I tend to lose them\nor misplace them so that's the main\nreason but I did notice when I used them\nthat there's some heat generated there\num I also am not convinced that plugging\nyour ears all day long is good there's\nsome ventilation through the through the\nsinus systems that include the ears so\nit sounds to me like you're not\nconcerned about the use of of\num earbuds but\num what about heat near the brain I mean\nthere's the the cochlea the auditory\nmechanisms that sit pretty close to the\nsurface there\num heat and neural tissue are not\nfriends sure\num I'd much rather get my brain cold\nthan hot yeah\num in terms of keeping the cells healthy\nand Alive\num should we be thinking about the heat\neffects of some of these devices or\nother things is there anything we're\noverlooking well think about it this way\nthe uh I use cars as an analogy a lot\nand you know mostly internal combustion\nengine cards so these analogies are\ngonna start to be foreign and useless\nfor another generation of people that\ngrow up in the era of electric cars but\nusing cars as a as a platform to talk\nabout uh\nfluid cooling systems your body has a\nmassive distributed fluid cooling system\nsimilar to a car's radiator\nyou're pumping blood all around your\nbody all the time at a very strictly\ncontrolled temperature\nthat blood carries it's mostly water so\nit carries a huge amount of the heat\naway or cold away from any area of the\nbody that's focused heating or focused\ncooling so you could put an ice cube on\nyour skin until it completely melts away\nand the blood is going to bring heat\nback to that area you can put you can\nstand in the sun under\nmuch more scary\nheating Rays from the Sun itself that\ncontain UV radiation that's that's\ndefinitely damaging your DNA if you're\nlooking for things to be afraid of the\nsun is a good one\nnow you're talking to the guy that tells\neverybody he got sunlight in their eyes\nevery morning but I don't want people to\nget burned or give themselves skin\ncancer I encourage people to protect\ntheir skin accordingly and and different\nindividuals require different levels of\nprotection from the Sun sure some people\ndo very well in a lot of sunshine never\nget basal cell or anything like that\nsome people and it's not just people\nwith very fair skin a minimum of sun\nexposure can cause some issues and here\nI'm talking about sun exposure to the\nskin of course staring at the sun is a\nbad idea I never recommend thinking\nabout the sun just as a heater uh you\nknow for for a moment to compare it with\nBluetooth headphones your body is very\ncapable of carrying that heat away and\ndissipating it you know via sweat\nevaporation\nor you know temperature Equalization so\nany heat that's locally generated in the\near\nyou know one there's a pretty large bony\nbarrier there but two there's a ton of\nblood flow in the scalp and in the head\nin general and definitely in the brain\nthat's going to regulate that\ntemperature so I think certainly there\ncan be a tiny temperature variation but\nI doubt very seriously that it's enough\nto cause a significant problem I'd like\nto go back to brain augmentation you've\nmade very clear that one of the first\ngoals for neurolink is to get\nquadriplegics walking again and again\nwhat a marvelous goal that is and I\ncertainly hope you guys succeed well\nagain just just to be very clear the\nfirst step is we we aren't reconnecting\nthe patient's own muscle system to their\nmotor Court allowing them um excuse me\nuh agency over the movement of things in\nthe world yes and eventually their body\nand you're exactly right yeah eventually\ntheir body we would we would love to do\nthat and we've done a lot of work on uh\ndeveloping a system for stimulating the\nspinal cord itself and so that gets to\nthe question that you uh that you asked\na few minutes ago of how do you\nreconnect the motor cortex to the rest\nof the body well if you can bypass the\ndamaged area of the spinal cord and have\nan implant in the spinal cord itself\nconnected to an implant in the brain and\nhave them talking to each other you can\ntake the perfectly intact motor signals\nout of the the motor cortex and send\nthem to the spinal cord which most of\nthe wiring should be intact in the\nspinal cord below the level of say the\nthe injury caused by a car accident or\nmotorcycle accident or gunshot wound or\nwhatever and it should be possible to\nreconnect the brain to the body in that\nway so not out of the realm of\npossibility that you know in some small\nnumber of years that neuralink will be\nable to reconnect to somebody's own body\nto their brain\nand here I just want to flag the\num 100 years or more of incredible work\nby basic scientists\num the names that I learned about in my\ntextbooks as a graduate student were\nlike georgeopolis and um that won't mean\nanything to anyone unless you're a\nneuroscientist but churchopolis um\nperformed some of the first\nsophisticated recordings out of motor\ncortex just simply asking like what\nsorts of electrical patterns are present\nin motor cortex as an animal or human\nmove is a limb\num Krishna shinoy being another\num major Pioneer in this area and many\nothers right and just really\nhighlighting the fact that basic\nresearch where\na exploration of neural tissue is\ncarried out at the level of anatomy and\nphysiology really sets down the pavement\non the runway to do the sorts of big\nclinical uh Expeditions that you all at\nneurolink are doing yeah it can't be\nsaid enough that you know we broadly\nspeaking in Industry sometimes are and\nsometimes stand on the shoulders of\nacademic Giants they were the real\nPioneers that they were involved in the\ngrind for years in an unglorious\nunglamorous way no stock option no stock\noptions\nand you know the reward uh for all the\nhard work is a paper at the end of the\nday that is read by you know dozens of\npeople and so you know they were\nselfless uh academic researchers that\nthat made all this possible and we all\nhumanity and neuralink owe them a\nmassive debt of gratitude for all the\nhard work that they've done and continue\nto do\nI agree I'd like to just take a brief\nmoment and thank one of our podcast\nsponsors which is inside tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that blood\nwork is the only way that you can\nmonitor the markers such as hormone\nmarkers lipids metabolic factors Etc the\nimpact your immediate and long-term\nHealth one major challenge with blood\nwork however is that most of the time it\ndoes not come back with any information\nabout what to do in order to move the\nvalues for hormones metabolic factors\nlipids Etc into the ranges that you want\nwith inside tracker changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized dashboard\nthat you can use to address the\nnutrition-based behavior-based\nsupplement-based approaches that you can\nuse in order to move those values into\nthe ranges that are optimal for you Your\nvitality and your longevity inside\ntracker now includes a measurement of\nAPO lipoprotein B so-called apob in\ntheir ultimate plan apob is a key marker\nof cardiovascular health and therefore\nthere's extreme value to knowing your\napob levels if you'd like to try inside\ntracker you can go to insidetracker.com\nhuberman to get 20 off any of inside\ntracker's plans again that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nalong the lines of augmentation early on\nin some of the public discussions about\nneurolink that I overheard between Elon\nand various podcast hosts Etc\nthere were some lofty ideas set out that\nI think are still very much in play in\npeople's minds things like for instance\nelectrical stimulation of the\nhippocampus that you so appropriately\nhave worn on your shirt today so for\nthose they have beautiful um looks like\neither a it looks like a Golgi or a\nkahal rendition of the hippocampus yeah\ntranslates to seahorse and it's an area\nof the brain that's involved in learning\nand memory and among other things\nthere was this idea thrown out that a\nchip or chips could be implants in the\nhippocampus that would allow greater\nthan normal memory abilities perhaps\nthat's one idea sure another idea that I\nheard about in these discussions was for\ninstance that you would have some chips\nin your brain and I would have some\nchips in my brain and you and I could\njust sit here look at he looking at each\nother or not nodding or shaking our\nheads and essentially hear each other's\nthoughts which sounds outrageous but of\ncourse why not why should we constrain\nourselves\num to uh as our good friend Eddie Chang\nand uh who's a neurosurgeon who was\nalready on this podcast once before said\nspeech is just the shaping of breath as\nit exits our lungs incredible really\nwhen you think about it but\nwe don't necessarily need speech to hear\nand understand each other's thoughts\nbecause the neural signals that produce\nthat shaping of the lungs come from some\nintention you know I have some idea\nalthough it might not seem like it about\nwhat I'm going to say next so is that\npossible that we could sit here\nand just hear each other's thoughts and\num and also how would we restrict what\nthe other person could hear yeah well so\nabsolutely I mean think about\nthe fact that we could do this right now\nif you pulled out your phone and started\ntexting me on my phone and I looked down\nand started texting you we would be\ncommunicating without looking at each\nother or talking\nshifting that function from a phone to\nan implanted device it requires no magic\nAdvance no Leap Forward it's technology\nwe already know how to do\nif we say put a device in that allows\nyou to control a keyboard and a mouse\nwhich is our stated intention for our\nfirst human clinical trial or and\nagainst I'm deliberately interrupting or\nI can text an entire team of people sure\nsimultaneously and they can text me and\nin theory I could have a bunch of\nthoughts and\n5 10 50 people could hear right\num or um probably more to their\npreference um they could talk to me yeah\nand and so you know texting each other\nwith our brains is maybe an uninspiring\nrendition of this but it it's not uh\nvery difficult to imagine the\nimplementation of the same device in a\nmore verbally focused area of the brain\nthat allows you to more naturally speak\nthe thoughts that you're thinking and\nhave me have them rendered into speech\nthat I can hear uh you know maybe via a\nbone conducting implant so silently here\nor or not silently like I could let's\nsay I was getting off the plane and I\nwanted to let somebody at home know that\nI had arrived I might be able to think\nin my mind think their first name which\nmight cue up a device that would then\nplay my voice to them and just got off\nthe plane I'm gonna grab my bag and then\nI'll give you a call right on their home\nAlexa right\nso that's all possible meaning we know\nthe origin of the neural signals that\ngive us rise to speech we know the\ndifferent mechanical and neural apparati\nlike the cochlea\num eardrums Etc that\ntransduce sound waves into electrical\nsignals right essentially all the pieces\nare known we're just really talking\nabout like refining it yeah refining it\nand reconfiguring it it's I mean it's\nnot an easy problem but it's really an\nengineering problem rather than a\nneuroscience problem for that for that\nuse case you know for a non-verbal\ncommunication you might say\num that's a solved problem in a very\ncrude disjointed way uh so some Labs\nhave solved you know part one of it some\nLabs have solved part two of it there\nare products out there that solve you\nknow say the implanted bone conduction\npart of it for the for the deaf\nCommunity\num\nthere are there are no implementations\nI'm aware of that are pulling all that\ntogether into one product that's a\nstreamlined package from end to end I\nthink that's a few years down the road\nand we I think have some hints of how\neasily or poorly people will adapt to\nthese um let's call them novel\nTransformations a few years ago I was on\nInstagram and I saw a post from a woman\num her name is cassar Jacobson and she\nis deaf since birth and can sign and to\nsome extent can relapse but she was\num\ndiscussing uh neosensory so this is a a\ndevice that translates sound in the\nenvironment into touch Sensations on her\nhand or wrist she's a uh admirer of\nbirds and all things Avian and\num I reached out to her about this\ndevice because I'm very curious because\nthis is a very interesting use case of\nof neuroplasticity in the sensory domain\nwhich is a fascination of mine and she\nsaid that\num yes indeed it afforded her novel\nexperiences now when walking past say\npigeons in the park if they were to make\nsome whatever sounds that pigeons make\nthat she would feel those sounds and\nthat indeed it enriched her experience\nof those birds\num in ways that obviously it wouldn't\notherwise I haven't followed up with her\nrecently to find out whether or not\nongoing use of neosensory has made for a\nbetter\nworse or kind of um\nequivalent experience of avians in the\nworld which were her is a near Obsession\num so she Delights in them\num what are your thoughts about in a\nperipheral devices like that periphery\nperipheral meaning outside of the the\nskull no requirement for a uh a surgery\ndo you think that there's a more\nimmediate or even a uh just generally\npotent\num use case for peripheral devices and\ndo you think that those are going to be\nused more readily before the kind of\nbrain surgery requiring devices are used\nyeah\num certainly the barrier to entry is\nlower the barrier to adoption is low you\nknow if you're making a tactile glove\nthat's\nhard to say no to when you can slip it\non and slip it off and not not have to\nget your skin cut at all\num\nwhat you know again there's no perfect\nmeasure of the efficacy of a device of\none device compared to another\nespecially across modalities but one one\nway that you can start to compare apples\nto oranges is bitrate you know useful\ninformation in or out of the brain as\nyou know transformed into digital data\nand so you can put a single number on\nthat and you have to ask when you look\nat a device like that is what is the bit\nrate in what is the bit rate out how\nmuch information are you able to\nusefully convey into the system and get\nout of the system into the body into the\nbrain and uh I think there's what we've\nseen in the early stabs at this is that\nthere's a very low threshold for bit\nrate on some of the devices that are\ntrying to avoid you know a direct brain\nsurgery Could you um perhaps say what\nyou just said but in a way that um maybe\npeople who aren't as familiar with\nthinking about bitrate might um\nmight be able to digest there I'm\nreferring to myself\num I mean I understand bitrate I\nunderstand that adding a new channel of\ninformation is just that adding\ninformation are you saying it's\nimportant to understand whether or not\nthat new information provides for novel\nfunction or experience and to and\num to what extent is the the newness of\nthat valid and adaptive well I'm saying\nmore uh\nit's hard to measure utility in this\nspace it's hard to you know put a single\nmetric single number on how useful a\ntechnology is\none crude way to try to get at that is\nis uh bit rate think of it as as back in\nthe days of dial-up modems the bit rate\nof your modem was you know 56k or 96 I\ncan still hear the sound of the dial up\nin the background\nyeah that was a bit rate that thankfully\nkept steadily going up and up and up\nyour your internet service provider\ngives you a number uh that is the\nmaximum usable data that you can\ntransmit back and forth from the\ninternet that's a useful way to think\nabout these assistive devices how much\ninformation are you able to get in into\nthe brain and out of the brain usefully\nand right now that that number is very\nsmall even compared to the old modems\nbut you have to ask yourself when you're\nlooking at a technology what's the\nceiling what's the theoretical maximum\nand for a lot of these Technologies the\ntheoretical maximum is is very low\ndisappointingly low even if it's\nperfectly executed and and perfect\ndeveloped as a technology and I think\nthe thing that attracts a lot of us to a\ntechnology like neuraling is that the\nceiling is incredibly High there's no\nobvious reason that you can't interface\nwith millions of neurons as this\ntechnology is refined and and developed\nfurther so that's the kind of wide band\nyou know high bandwidth brain interface\nthat you want to develop if you're\ntalking about\num and a semantic prosthetic uh an AI\nassistant to your cognitive abilities uh\nyou know the more sci-fi things that we\nthink about in the coming decades\num\nso uh it's an important caveat when\nyou're evaluating these Technologies\nthey really want it to be something that\nyou can expand off into the Sci-Fi\nso let's take this a step further\nbecause as you're saying this I'm\nrealizing that people have been doing\nexactly what neurolink is trying to do\nnow for a very long time let me give you\nan example\num\npeople who are blind who have no pattern\nVision have used canes for a very long\ntime now the cane is not a chip it's not\na an electrode it's not neosensory right\nnone of that stuff\nwhat it is is essentially a a stick that\nhas\num\nan interface with a surface so it swept\nback and forth across the ground and\nyou're translating what would otherwise\nbe visual cues into\nsomatosensory cues sure and we know that\nblind people are very good at\nunderstanding\num even when they are approaching say a\ncurb Edge because they are integrating\nthat information from the tip of the\ncane\num up through their somatosensory cortex\nand their motor cortex with other things\nlike the changes in the the wind and the\nsound as they round a corner and um here\nI'm imagining a like a corner in San\nFrancisco downtown which you get to the\ncorner it's a completely different set\nof auditory cues\nand very often we know and this is\nbecause my laboratory worked on visual\nrepair for a long time I talked to a lot\nof blind people who use different\ndevices to navigate the world that they\naren't aware of the fact that they're\nintegrating these other cues but they\nnonetheless do them subconsciously right\num and in doing so get pretty good at\nnavigating with a cane right now Kane\nisn't perfect but you can imagine the\nother form of of navigating as a blind\nperson uh which is to just attach\nyourself\nor attached to you another nervous\nsystem the best that we know being a dog\nsighted dog sure that can cue you again\nwith a stopping at a curb's edge or even\nif there are some individuals that might\nseem a little sketchy dogs are also very\ngood at sensing\num different uh arousal States and\nothers threat danger sure I mean they're\nExquisite at it right so here what we're\nreally talking about is taking a cane or\nanother biological system essentially a\nwhole nervous system and saying this\nother nervous system's job is to get you\nto navigate more safely through the\nworld right in some sense what neurolink\nis trying to do is that but with\nrobotics to insert them and chips which\nraises the the question people are going\nto say finally a question the question\nis this we hear about\nBMI brain machine interface which is\nreally what neuraling specializes in we\nalso hear about AI another example where\nthere's great promise and great fear\nright we hear about machine learning as\nwell to what extent can these brain\nmachine interfaces\nlearn the same way a seeing eye dog\nwould learn but unlike a seeing eye dog\ncontinue to learn over time and get\nbetter and better and better because\nit's also listening to the nervous\nsystem that it's trying to support right\nput simply what is the role for AI and\nmachine learning in the type of work\nthat you're doing that's a great\nquestion I think you know it goes both\nways basically what you're doing is\ntaking a very crude software\nintelligence I would say not exactly a\nfull full-blown AI but it's some\nwell-designed software that can adapt to\nchanges in firing of the brain and\nyou're coupling it with another form of\nintelligence a human intelligence and\nyou're allowing the two to learn each\nother so undoubtedly the human that has\na neuralink device will get better at\nusing it over time undoubtedly the\nsoftware that the neurolink engineers\nhave written will adapt to the firing\npatterns that that the device is able to\nrecord and over time focus in on\nmeaningful signals toward movement right\nso if a neuron is fire a high firing\nrate when you intend to move the mouse\ncursor up and to the right\nit doesn't know that when it starts when\nyou first put this in it's just a random\nseries of signals as far as the chip\nknows but you start correlating it with\nwhat the person what you know the person\nwants to do as expressed in a series of\ngames so you you assume that\nyou know that the person wants to move\nthe mouse on the screen to the Target\nthat's shown because you tell them\nthat's the goal and so you start\ncorrelating the activity\nthat you record when they're moving\ntoward an up and right Target on a\nscreen with that firing pattern and\nsimilarly for up and left down and left\ndown and right and so you develop a\nmodel\num\nsemi-intelligently in the software for\nwhat the person is intending to do and\nlet the person run wild with it for a\nwhile and they start to get better at\nusing the model presented to them by the\nby the software as expressed by the\nmouse moving or not moving properly on\nthe screen right so it's imagine a\nscenario where you're asking somebody to\nplay piano but\nthe the sound that comes out of each key\nrandomly shifts over time\num very difficult problem but a human\nbrain is good enough with the aid of\nsoftware to solve that problem and and\nmap well enough to a semi-stable state\nthat they're going to know how to use\nthat Mouse even when they say turn the\ndevice off for the night come back to it\nthe next day and some of the signals\nhave shifted so you're describing this\nI'm I'm recalling a recent experience I\ngot one of these um rowers you know for\nto exercise and I am well aware that\nthere's a proper row stroke and there's\na improper row stroke and most everybody\nincluding me who's never been coached in\nrowing gets on this thing and pushes\nwith their legs and pulls with their\narms and back and it's some mix of\nIncorrect and maybe a smidgen of correct\ntype execution\nthere's a function within the rower that\nallows\nyou in this case I mean to play a game\nwhere you can actually\num every row stroke you generate arrows\non toward a dartboard and it knows\nwhether or not you're generating the\nappropriate forces at the given segment\nto the row the initial pull when you're\nleaning back Etc and adjusts the\ntrajectory of the arrow so that when you\ndo a proper row stroke it gets closer to\na bullseye and it's very satisfying\nbecause you now have a visual feedback\nthat's unrelated to this\num the kinds of instructions that one\nwould expect like oh you know hinge your\nhip a bit more or you know splay your\nknees a bit more reach more with your\narms or pull first with your back all\nthe rowers are probably cringing as I\nsay this because they're realizing the\nwhat is exactly the point which is I\ndon't know how to row but over time\nsimply by paying attention to whether or\nnot the arrow is hitting the bullseye or\nnot more or less frequently\nyou can improve your row stroke and get\nas I understand pretty close to Optimal\nrow stroke\nin the same way that if you had a coach\nthere telling you hey do this and do\nthat what we're really talking about\nhere is neurobiofeedback sure so is that\nanalogy similar to what you're\ndescribing yeah that's a great analogy\nyou know humans are really good at\nlearning how to play games in software\nso video games are an awesome platform\nfor us to use as a training environment\nfor people to get better at controlling\nthese things in fact it's it's the\ndefault and the obvious way to do it is\nto have people and monkeys play video\ngames do you play video games yeah sure\nwhich video games\nlet's see I you know play old ones I'm a\nlittle nostalgic so uh I uh like the old\nBlizzard game Starcraft and Warcraft I\ndon't even know those I remember the\nfirst Apple computers I mean I go how\nold are you uh 43 okay 44 now as of a\nfew days ago happy birthday so we're a\nlittle bit offset there yeah I can\nrecall um Mike Tyson's punch out like\nthe original Nintendo game Super Mario\nBrothers\num but the game so the games you're\ndescribing I don't recall that my\nunderstanding is that the newer games\nare are far more sophisticated in some\nrespects I I did recently find time to\nplay cyberpunk\num which was really satisfying and maybe\nappropriate\nit's a game where the characters are all\nfully modded out with cybernetic\nimplants well perfect um but you know\nthe the root of the game is run around\nand shoot things so maybe not so\ndifferent from you know duck hunt or\nwhatever from our childhoods\nthe reason I ask about video games is um\nthere's been some controversy as to\nwhether or not they are making young\nbrains better or worse and I think some\nof the work from Adam gazzali's Lab at\nUCSF and other Laboratories have shown\nthat actually provided that um\nchildren in particular and adults are\nalso spending time in normal face to\nlet's call them more traditional\nface-to-face interactions that video\ngames can actually make nervous systems\nthat is people a much more proficient at\nlearning and motor execution sure\num visual detection\num and on and on yeah there's some work\nuh showing that surgeons are better if\nthey play video games so I try to\nsqueeze some in as a you know a\nprofessional development activity great\ngreat well I'm sure you're getting\ncheers from the uh from those that like\nvideo games out there and some of the\nparents who are trying to get their kids\nto play fewer video games are cringing\nbut that's okay we'll let them settle uh\nthey're familial disputes among\nthemselves\nlet's talk about pigs sure\nneural link has been\num quite generous I would say in\nannouncing their discoveries and their\ngoals and I I want to highlight this\nbecause I think it's quite unusual for a\ncompany to do this\num I'm probably going to earn a few\nenemies by saying this\num despite the fact that I've always\nowned Apple devices and from the South\nBay\num you know the apple design team is\nnotoriously cryptic about what they're\ngoing to do next or when the next phone\nor computer is going to come out is is\nis vaulted to\num a serious extent neural link has been\npretty open about their goals right with\nthe understanding the goals change and\nhave to change and one of the things\nthat they've done which I think is\nmarvelous is they've held online\nsymposia\nwhere you and some other colleagues of\nmine from the Neuroscience committee Dan\nAdams who have tremendous respect for\nand Elon and others their neural link\nhave shared some of the progress that\nthey've made in experimental animals I'm\nhighlighting this because I think if one\ntakes a step back I mean just for most\npeople to\nknow about and realize that there's\nexperimentation on animals implantation\nof electrodes and so on is itself a\npretty bold move because that\nunderstandably evokes some strong\nemotions\num in people and in some people evokes\nextremely strong emotions sure\num\nneural link did one such Symposium where\nthey showed implant devices in pigs\nright\nthen they did another one you guys did\nanother one where it was implant devices\nin monkeys right I assume at some point\nthere will be one of these public\nsymposia where\num the implant devices will be in a\nhuman\nwhat was the rationale for using pigs\nI'm told pigs are very nice creatures\nyeah I'm told that they are quite smart\nright\num and\nfor all my years as a neuroscientist and\nhaving worked admittedly on every\nspecies from mice to cuttlefish to\nhumans to hamsters to uh you know I\nconfess um various carnivore species\nwhich I no longer do I work on humans\nnow for various reasons I never in my\nlife thought I would see a implant\ndevice in the cortex of a pig sure why\nwork on pigs yeah well let me let me say\nfirst neurolink is almost entirely\ncomposed of animal loving people the\npeople at norlink are\nobsessive animal lovers there are signs\nup all around the office you know\nspontaneously put up by people within\nthe organization you know talking about\nhow we want to save animals we want to\nprotect animals\nif there was any possible way\nto help people the way we want to help\npeople without using animals in our\nresearch we would do it it's just not\nknown how to do that right now and so we\nare completely restricted to making\nadvances to getting a device approval\nthrough the FDA by first showing that\nit's incredibly safe in animals\nand so as is the case for any medical\nadvancement essentially exactly I do\nwant to highlight this that the the FDA\nand the other governing bodies\num\noversee these types of experiments and\nensure that they're done with a minimum\nof discomfort to the animals of course\nbut\num I think there's an inherent\nspeciesism right in uh in most humans\nnot all some people truly see\nequivalence between a lizard and a human\nlizard life being equivalent to human\nlife most human beings I think in\nparticular human beings who themselves\nor have loved ones that are suffering\nfrom diseases that they hope could be\ncured at some point view themselves as\nspecies and feel that if you have to\nwork on a biological system\nin order to solve the problem\num working on non-human animals first\nmakes sense right to most people sure\nbut certainly there's a category of\npeople that feels very strongly in the\nopposite direction sure and you know I\nthink we would probably be having a very\ndifferent conversation around animal\nresearch if uh we weren't you know we as\na species we as a culture weren't just\ncasually\nslaughtering millions of animals to eat\nthem\num\nevery single day and so that is a\nbackground against which that the\nrelatively minuscule number of animals\nused in research it becomes almost\nimpossible to understand why someone\nwould point to that ridiculously small\nnumber of animals used in research when\nthe vast vast majority of animals that\nhumans use and end their lives are are\ndone for food or for fur or for fur or\nthese other reasons that people you know\nhave historically used animals so we in\nin that context we do animal research\nbecause we have to there's no other way\naround it if tomorrow\nuh laws were changed and the FDA said\nokay you can do some of this early\nexperimentation in willing human\nparticipants that would be a very\ninteresting option I think there would\nbe a lot of people that would step up\nand say yes I'm willing to participate\nin early stage clinical research you\nalready volunteered uh yeah\num and I wouldn't be alone and that you\nknow is a potential way that animals\ncould maybe be spared uh being unwilling\nparticipants in this\non that note to whatever extent possible\nI think neuralink goes\num\nreally really far much much farther than\nanyone I've ever heard of any\norganization I've ever heard of any\nanything I've ever seen to give the\nanimals agency in every aspect of the\nresearch\nwe have just an incredible team of\npeople looking out for the animals and\ntrying to design the experiments such\nthat they're as purely opt-in as humanly\npossible\nno animal is ever compelled to\nparticipate in experiments beyond the\nsurgery itself so if say on a given day\nour our star monkey pager doesn't want\nto play video games for Smoothie no one\nforces them to ever this is a very\nimportant point and I want to cue people\nto really what Matt is saying here\num obviously the animals are being\nresearched on for neural links so they\ndon't get to opt in to opt out of the\nexperiment right\num but what he's saying is that they\nplay these games during which neural\nsignals are measured from the brain\nbecause they have electrodes implanted\nin their brain through a surgery that\nthankfully to the brain is painless\nright no pain receptors in the brain\num and are playing for reward this is\nvery different very different than the\ntypical scenario in Laboratories around\nthe world where people experiment on\nmice monkeys some kisses pigs or other\nspecies in which the typical Arrangement\nis to water deprive the animals we never\ndo that and then have the animals work\nfor their daily ration of water right\nand some people are hearing this and\nprobably think wow that's barbaric and\nhere I'm not trying to point fingers at\nthe people doing that kind of work I\njust think it's important that people\nunderstand how the work is done right in\norder to motivate an animal\nto play a video game right depriving\nthem of something that they yearn for is\na very efficient way to do that we don't\ndo that we they have free and full\naccess to food this entire time so they\naren't hungry they aren't thirsty the\nonly thing that would motivate them is\nif they want a treat extra to their\nnormal rations\nbut there's there's never any\ndeprivation there's never any adverse\nnegative stimuli that pushes them to do\nanything I must say I'm impressed by\nthat decision\num because uh\ntraining animals to do tasks in\nlaboratory settings is very hard and the\nreason so many researchers have\ndefaulted to water deprivation and and\nhaving animals work for a ration of\nwater is because frankly it works right\nit allows people to finish their PHD or\ntheir postdoc more quickly than having\nto wait around\num and try and figure out why uh their\nmonkey isn't working that day in fact\nhaving known a number of people who've\ndone these kinds of experiments although\nwe've never done them in my lab\nmy monkey isn't working today is a\ncommon uh gripe among graduate students\nand postdocs who do this kind of work\num and for people who work on mice okay\nso this is um uh very important\ninformation to get across and there's no\nPublic Relation statement uh woven into\nthis is just we're talking about the\nnature of the research but I think it is\nimportant that people are aware of this\nyeah it's one of the one of the\nunderappreciated Innovations out of\nneurolink is how far the Animal Care\nteam has been able to to move in the\ndirection of Humane treatment of these\nguys wonderful as an animal lover myself\nI can only say wonderful\nwhy pigs yeah pigs are you know they're\nactually fairly commonly used in medical\ndevice research\num more you know in the cardiac area\ntheir hearts are you know somewhat\nsimilar to human hearts how big are\nthese pigs I've seen Little Pigs and\nI've seen big pigs yeah there's a range\nthere's a bunch of different varieties\nof pig there's a bunch of different\nspecies that um you know you can\noptimize for different uh\ncharacteristics there's mini pigs\nthere's\num you know Yorkshires there's uh a lot\nof different kind of pigs that we use in\ndifferent contexts\nwhen we're trying to optimize a certain\ncharacteristic\nso yeah the pigs are we don't\nnecessarily need them to be smart or\ntask performers although occasionally we\nhave you know trained them to walk on a\ntreadmill when we're studying how their\nlimbs move for some of our spinal cord\nresearch\num but we're not you know recording\ninteresting say cognitive data out of\ntheir minds they're really just a\nbiological platform with a skull that's\nclose enough in size and shape to humans\nto be a valid platform to study the\nsafety of the device\nunlike a monkey or a human a pig\nI don't think can reach out and hit a\nbutton or a lever exactly how are they\nsignaling that they um saw or\num sent to something yeah so again the\npigs are really just a safety platform\nto say the device is safe to implant it\ndoesn't you know break down or cause any\nkind of toxic reaction the monkeys are\nwhere we are really doing our heavy\nlifting in terms of ensuring that we're\ngetting good signals out of the device\nthat that what we expect to see in\nhumans is validated on a functional\nlevel in in monkeys first\nlet's talk about the skull yeah years\nago you and I were enjoying a\nconversation about these very sorts of\nthings that we're discussing today and\nhe said you know the skull is actually a\npretty lousy uh biological adaptation\nfar better would be a titanium plate You\nKnow spoken like a true neurosurgeon uh\nwith a radio receiver implanted in his\nhand\num but in all seriousness\nyou know drilling through the skull with\na two millimeter hole certainly don't do\nthis at Home Folks\num please don't do this but\num that yes that's a small\num entry site but I think most people\ncringe when they hear about that or\nthink about that sure and it obviously\nhas to be done by a neurosurgeon with\nall the appropriate\num uh\nenvironmental conditions in place to\nlimit infection\nwhat did you mean when you said that the\nskull is a poor adaptation in a titanium\nplate will be better and in particular\nwhat does that mean in reference to\nthings like traumatic brain injury I\nmean are human beings unnecessarily\nvulnerable at the level of traumatic\nbrain injury because our skulls are just\nnot\num hard enough\nyou know maybe I'm being too harsh about\nskull the skull is uh very good at what\nit does given the tools that we are\nworking with as biological organisms\nthat develop in our mother's uterus the\nskull is you know usually the\nappropriate size it's one of the hardest\nthings in your body\num that said there are a couple puzzling\nvulnerabilities\nsome of the thinnest bone in the skull\nis in the temporal region this is uh you\nknow neurosurgeons will all know that\nI'm heading toward a feature that\nsometimes Darkly is called God's Little\njoke\nwhere the very thin bone of the of the\ntemporal\num part of the skull has one of the\nlargest arteries that goes to the lining\nof the brain right attached to the\ninside of it and so this this bone just\nto the side of your eye tends to\nfracture if you're struck there and the\nsharp edges of that fractured bone very\noften cut an artery called the middle\nmeningeal artery that leads to a big\nblood clot that crushes the brain that's\nhow a lot of people with you know\notherwise would be a relatively minor\ninjury end up dying is this large blood\nclot developing from high pressure\narterial blood that crushes the the\nbrain\nand so why would you put the artery\nright on the inside of the very thin\nbone that's most likely to fracture it's\nan enduring mystery but this is probably\nthe most obvious failure mode in in you\nknow the design of a human skull\notherwise you know in terms of General\nimpact resistance\nI think the brain is a very hard thing\nto protect and the the architecture of\nhuman anatomy probably given all other\npossible architectures that can arise\nfrom development it's not that bad\nreally\num\none of the interesting features in terms\nof shock absorption that hopefully\nprevents a lot of traumatic brain injury\nis the fluid sheath around the brain the\nthe brain you may know is\num it's mostly fat it floats in salt\nwater in our brains so our brains are\nall floating in in salt water and so\nwith rapid acceleration deceleration\nthat sheath of salt water adds a\nmarvelous protective cushion against\ndevelopment of\nyou know bruising of the brain say or\nbleeding in the brain and so I think for\nany flaws in the design that do exist\num\nyou can imagine things being a lot worse\nand there's probably a lot fewer tbis\nthan would exist if a human designer was\ntaking a first crack at it\nas you describe the the thinness of this\ntemporal bone and the in the presence of\na critical artery just beneath it\num I'm thinking about most helmets\num and here I also want to cue up the\nfact that while whenever we hear about\nTBI or CTE or brain injury people always\nthink football hockey but most traumatic\nbrain injuries are things like car\naccidents or construction work right and\nit's not football and hockey for some\nreason football and hockey and boxing\nget all the attention but my colleagues\nthat work on traumatic brain injury tell\nme that most of the traumatic brain\ninjury they see is somebody slips at a\nparty and hits their head or\num uh you know was in a car accident or\nenvironmental environmental accidents of\nvarious kinds\nto my mind most helmets don't actually\ncover this region close to the eyes so\nis there is there also a failure of um\nhelmet engineering that um you know I\ncan understand why you'd want to have\nyour peripheral vision out the sides of\nyour eyes uh per free of your eyes but\nit seems to me if this is such critical\nreal estate why why isn't it being\nbetter protected\nyou know I'm no expert in helmets but\num I don't think we see a lot of\nepidural hematomas and squirts injuries\nto get this kind of injury you usually\nneed a really focal blunt trauma like\nthe baseball bat to the head is a\nclassic mechanism of injury\nthat would lead to to a temporal bone\nfracture an epidural hematoma\num with sports injuries you know you\ndon't often see that especially in\nfootball with uh you know a a sharp\nsharper object coming in contact with\nthe head it's usually another helmet\nright is the the mechanism of injury uh\nso I I I can't think off the top of my\nhead of an instance of this exact injury\ntype in sports\nyou spent a lot of time poking around in\nbrains of humans\num and while I realize this is not your\narea of expertise you are somebody who I\nam aware you know cares about his health\nand the health of your family and I\nthink generally People's Health\num when you look out on the landscape of\nthings that people\ncan do and shouldn't do if their desire\nis to keep their brain healthy do any\num any data or any particular practices\ncome to mind I mean I think we've all\nheard the obvious one don't don't get a\nhead injury right if you do get a head\ninjury make sure it gets treated and\ndon't get a second head injury right but\nthose are sort of duh type\num answers that um I'm able to give so\nI'm curious about the answers that um\nperhaps I'm not able to give yeah well\nyou know the obvious ones it's one that\nyou you talk about a lot\num and I see a lot of the the smoldering\nwreckage of humanity you know in the\noperating room uh and in the emergency\nroom for people that come in you know I\nwork my practices in San Francisco right\nnext to the tenderloin and so a lot of\npeople that end up coming in from the\ntender line have been drinking just\nspectacular amounts of alcohol for a\nlong time and their brains are uh you\nknow very often on the scans they look\nlike small walnuts inside their empty\nskull there's so much atrophy that\nhappens with an alcohol soaked brain\nchronically\nthat I would say that's you know Far and\nAway the most common source of brain\ndamage that many of us just volunteer\nfor and it's you know when you look at\nthe morbidity kind of the human harm in\naggregate that's done it's mystifying\nthat that it's\nnot something that we are all paranoid\nabout we're\num people think that I don't drink it\nall I'll occasionally have a drink I I\ncould take it or leave it frankly if all\nthe alcohol in the plant disappeared I\nwouldn't notice but I do occasionally\nhave a drink maybe one per year or\nsomething like that but I am shocked at\num this current state of affairs around\nalcohol consumption and advertising Etc\nwhen I look at the data mainly out of\nthe UK brain bank which basically shows\nthat for every drink that one has on a\nregular basis\nwhen you go from zero to one drink per\nweek\nthere's more brain atrophy thinning of\nthe gray matter cortex you go from one\nto two more thinning you go from two to\nthree and there's a near linear\nrelationship between the amount that\npeople are drinking and the amount of\nbrain atrophy and to me it's like it's\njust sort of obvious from the these\nlarge-scale studies that\num as you point out alcohol atrophy is\nthe brain yeah it kills neurons right\nand I don't have any bias against\nalcohol or people that drink I know many\nof them but it does seem to me kind of\nshocking\num that we're talking about you know the\nResveratrol and red wine which is at you\nknow infinitesimally small amounts and\nnot even clear Resveratrol is good for\nus anyway by the way\num a matter of debate I should point out\nbut um so alcohol certainly alcohol and\nexcess is bad for the brain sure\num in terms of uh okay so we have head\nhits bad alcohol bad\num you're working as you mentioned\nyou're the tenderloin\num is there any awareness that\namphetamine use can can disrupt brain\nstructure or function you know that\nthat's not an area that I spent a lot of\ntime researching in I you know I\nincidentally take care of people that\nhave used every substance known to man\nin quantities that are you know\nspectacular but I haven't specifically\ndone research in that area I'm not super\nwell versed on the literature\nyeah I ask in part because\num maybe you know a colleague or will\ncome across a colleague who's working on\nthis is there's just such a\num a incredible increase in the use of\nthings like Adderall Ritalin modafinil\narmodafinil which I think in small\namounts in clinical clinically\nprescribed situations can be very\nbeneficial but\num let's be honest many people are using\nthese on a chronic basis right I don't\nthink we really know what it does to the\nbrain aside from increasing addiction\nfor those substances that's very clear\nwell For Better or Worse we're\ngenerating a massive data set right now\nwell put\num\nI'd like to briefly go back to our\nearlier discussion about neuroplasticity\nyou made an interesting statement which\nis that we are not aware of any single\nbrain area that one can stimulate in\norder to invoke plasticity right it's a\nmalleability of neural architecture\nyears ago Mike mirzanek and colleagues\nat UCSF did some experiments where they\nstimulate nucleus basalis and paired\nthat stimulation with eight kilohertz\ntone or um in some cases they could also\nstimulate a different brain area the\nventral tegmental area which causes the\nrelease of dopamine and pair it with a\ntone and in it seemed in every one of\nthese cases they observed\nmassive plasticity\num now I look at those data and I\ncompare them to the kind of classic data\num I think it was Carl Ashley that did\nthese experiments where they would take\nanimals and they'd scoop out a little\nbit of Cortex\nput the animal back into a learning\nenvironment and the animal would do\npretty well if not perfectly sure so\nthey scoop out a different region of\nCortex and a different animal and by the\nend of maybe three four years of these\nkinds of lesion experiments they\num referred to the equal potential of\nthe cortex meaning they concluded that\nit didn't matter which piece of the\ncortex you took out that there was no\none critical area so on the one hand\nyou've got these experiments that say\nyou know you don't really need\na lot of the brain right and and every\nonce in a while a news story will come\nout where um they'll a patient a person\nwill go in for a brain scan for some\nother reason or an experiment and the\nperson seems perfectly normal and\nthey're like missing half their cortex\nright and then on the other hand you\nhave these experiments like the\nstimulation of basalus or VTA where you\nget massive plasticity from stimulation\nin one area I was I've never been able\nto reconcile these kinds of discrepant\nfindings and so I'd really like just\nyour opinion on this you know what is it\nabout the brain as an organ that lets it\nbe both so critical at the level of\nindividual neurons in circuits so so\ncritical and yet at the same time\num it's able to uh circumvent these what\nwould otherwise seem like massive\nlesions and holes in itself yeah I mean\na lot of a lot of it to reconcile those\nexperiments you first account for the\nfact that they're probably in different\nspecies right you take out a particular\nportion of a pig or a rabbit grain a\nsmall amount you might not see a\ndifference but a small portion of a\nhuman brain say the part most interested\nin coordinating speech or finger\nmovement and you're going to see\nprofound losses or visual cortex right\nI take out a small portion of V1 and\nyou'll you'll have a visual deficit\num and so species matters uh age matters\nif you take out half of the brain in a\nvery young baby\nthat baby has a reasonable chance of\ndeveloping High a high degree of\nfunction by having the remaining half\nsubsume some of the functions lost on\nthe other side\nbecause they're very very young and\ntheir brain is still developing it's a\nit's to some degree a blank slate with\nextremely high plasticity over many\nyears so that can overcome a lot of\ndeficits\num\ntaking an adult\nanimal's brain that isn't very well\ndifferentiated functionally to begin\nwith you might not see those deficits so\napparently there's a lot of redundancy\nas well right there's a lot of say\ncerebellar and spinal circuits in other\nanimals that\ngenerate stereotyped Behavior patterns\nand might not need the brain at all to\nperform say a walking movement or some\nother sequences of motor activities so a\nlot of that depends on the experimental\nsetup I would say in general adult\nhumans are very vulnerable to losing\nsmall parts of their brains and losing\ndiscrete functions\nI'm going to take the liberty of asking\na question that merges across neural\nLink in Tesla\nI could imagine that\ncars whether or not they're on autopilot\nmode or being driven by the human\ndirectly\num and Society generally would benefit\nfrom knowing whether or not a human is\nvery alert or sleepy sure\nI don't own a Tesla um\nperhaps this technology already exists\nbut is there any idea that a simple\nsensor maybe even a just eyelid position\nor pupil size or head position\ncould be introduced to\na car like the Tesla or another car for\nthat matter yeah and resolve a common\nproblem which is that when people are\nless alert not just when people fall\nasleep but the simple drop in alertness\nthat occurs when people are sleepy is my\nread of the data is responsible for\napproximately a third a third it's\nincredible of accidents between vehicles\nand then of course some percentage of\nthose are going to be lethal accidents\nso in terms of preserving life this\nmight seem like a minor case but it's\nactually a major case scenario yeah you\nknow I have no you know special insight\ninto how Tesla software works I know\nthey have brilliant engineers\num\nwhen I have a Tesla when I drive it it\nseems to know when I'm looking at the\nroad versus not and it yells at me if\nI'm not looking at the roads how does it\ndo that and what voice does it use\nthere's a small camera uh up by the\nrearview mirror and I think it's a\nsimple eye track my my guess here is\nthat it's a simple eye tracking program\num and so it may already be the case\nthat it's implemented that it's\ndetecting whether your eyes are open or\nnot obviously you know it's not\num strict it's not stringent because\nsunglasses\num and I've I've seen Forums on the\ninternet where people tape over that\nsmall camera so like so they can wall oh\ngoodness but uh you know I think they're\ndefinitely making efforts to try to try\nto save lives here\nincredible I say incredible just because\nI think I'm fortunate enough to live in\na lifetime where there were no electric\ncars when I was growing up and now\nthings are moving oh so fast\num no pun intended\nwhat is your wish for brain machine\ninterface and brain augmentation so\nlet's let's assume that the the clinical\nstuff can be worked out or maybe you\nhave a a pet clinical condition that you\njust are um just yearning to see\nresolved yeah that would be fine too but\nin addition to that way you really just\nexpand out let's say we can\nextend your life 200 years or we're\nthinking about the kind of world that\nyour children are going to live in and\ntheir grandchildren will live in what do\nyou think is really possible yeah with\nbrain augmentation and brain machine\ninterface and here please feel no bias\nwhatsoever to answer in a way that\nreveals to us your\num your incredible empathy and\nconsideration of clinical conditions\nbecause that's how you spend your days\nis fixing patients uh and helping their\nlives be better so if it lands in that\ncategory great but\num for sake of of fun and forsake of\ndelight and forsake of um really getting\nus the audience to to understand what's\nreally possible here please feel no\nshackles yeah uh well you know I I\nlove the idea down the road and we're\ntalking you know a 10-year maybe 20-year\ntime frame of uh humans just getting\ncontrol over some of the horrible ways\nthat their brains go wrong right so\nI think everybody\nat this point has either known someone\nor second order known someone a friend\nof a friend who has been touched by\naddiction or depression suicide\nobesity these functions of the brain or\nmalfunctions of the brain are what\ndrives me these are the things that I\nwant to tackle in my career you know in\nterms of my kids lifetime I'm thinking\nyou know full human expansion of human\ncognition into AI full immersion in the\ninternet of your cognitive abilities\nhaving no limitation for what you think\num as bottlenecked by needing to read\nthe Wikipedia article first to have the\ndata to inform your thoughts\nhaving communication with anyone that\nyou want to unrestricted by this you\nknow flapping air past meat on your face\nit's a\nyou know a means of communication that's\nridiculously prone to being\nmisunderstood it's also a tiny narrow\nbottleneck of communication where you\nknow trying to send messages back and\nforth through a tiny straw and there's\nno reason that needs to necessarily be\ntrue it's the way things have always\nbeen but it isn't the way things are\ngoing to be in the future\nuh and I think there's a\nyou know\na million\nvery sci-fi possibilities in terms of\nbanding human Minds together to be even\nmore potent as a as a multi-unit uh\norganism uh you know as an opt-in\nmulti-brain\nuh you know these are things that are so\nfar down the road I can't even directly\nsee how they would be implemented but\nthe technology we're working on is a\nlittle crack in the door that allows\nsome of this stuff to even be thought\nabout in a realistic way\nwell to that to that point I you know\nencourage anyone who is you know excited\nabout things like that you know\nespecially mechanical engineers software\nEngineers robotics engineers come to the\nneuralink website and look at the jobs\nwe've got we need the brightest people\non the planet working on these the\nhardest problems uh in the world in my\nopinion and so if you want to work on\nthis stuff come help us\nI have several responses and to what you\njust said\num first off I'll get the the least\nimportant one out of the way which is\nthat years ago I applied for a job at\nneurolink the neural link website at\nthat time was incredibly sparse right it\nwas just said neural link and I said if\nyou're interested give us your email so\nI put my email there I got no response\nso\num the uh they made a wise choice in um\nnow uh fast forward several years I am\num very grateful and I think very lucky\num that you who passed through\nfortunately for me through my lab at one\npoint and we had some fun Expeditions\ntogether in the wild uh neural\nexploration so we can talk about some\nother time as well as I'm learning from\nyou as you pass through your time at\nStanford\num but have arrived there at neurolink\nand and I'll say that they're very lucky\nto have you and um folks like Dan Adams\nwho have known for your very long time\nso uh phenomenal neurosurgeons like\nyourself neuroscientists and\num Vision scientists like Dan and others\nit's really an incredible Mission so I\nreally want to start off by saying um\nthank you to you and all your colleagues\nthere I know that neurolink is really\ntip of the spear in being public facing\nwith the kinds of things they're doing\nand and being so forthcoming about how\nthat work is done in animals and exactly\nwhat they're doing\num and that's a very brave stance to\ntake yeah especially given the nature of\nthe work but well that's classic Elon\nright he he doesn't keep secrets in\npublic too commonly he tells you what\nhe's going to do and then he does it and\npeople are always amazed by that you\nknow he releases the Tesla master plan\nand tells you exactly what the company\nintends to do for the next several years\nand people assume that there's some\nsubterfuge that he is misdirecting but\nit's it's right out there in the open\nand I think neuraling follows in that\npath of you know we want people to know\nwhat we're doing we want the brightest\npeople in the world to come help us we\nwe want to be able to help patients we\nwant\nyou know the most motivated patients\nwith quadriplegia to you know visit our\npatient registry uh and and sign up to\nbe considered for clinical trials that\nthat will happen in the future we'll put\na link to that by the way so um maybe\njust uh the direct call could happen now\nso you uh this is for people who are\nquadriplegic or who know people who are\nquadriplegic who are interested in being\npart of this clinical trial it's a\npatient registry right now that we're\njust collecting information to see who\nmight be eligible for clinical trials\nthat'll happen in the future we're still\nworking with the FDA to hammer out the\ndetails and and get their final\npermission uh to proceed with the trial\ngreat so please see the note in the show\nnote the link excuse me in the in the\nshow note captions for that yeah I want\nto thank you guys for your stance uh\nbeing public facing and also doing the\nincredibly hard work I also think the\nrobotics aspect which you've clarified\nfor me uh today is extremely Forward\nThinking and uh absolutely critical so a\nlot of critical engineering that note\nout will Wick out into other domains of\nneurosurgery and medical technology not\njust serving neural links Mission\ndirectly and I really want to thank you\nuh first of all for coming here today\nand taking time out of your important\nschedule of seeing patients and doing\nbrain surgery literally time away from\nyour family and time away from your\nmission at neurolink briefly to uh to\nshare with people what you guys are\ndoing as I mentioned before there's a\nlot of Mystique around it and even\ndespite the fact that neurolink has gone\nout of their way to try and erase some\nof that Mystique this to me is the\nclearest picture ever to my knowledge\nthat has been given about what's going\non there and and the the stated and the\nreal Mission and what's going on at the\nlevel of of nuts and bolts and and guts\nand brains and this kind of thing and I\nreally just want to thank you also for\nfor being you which is uh perhaps sounds\nlike a a kind of an odd um thing to hear\nbut\nI think as made apparent by the device\nimplanted in your hand you don't just\num do this for a job you live and\nbreathe and embody truly embody this\nstuff around the nervous system and\ntrying to figure out how to fix it how\nto make it better and you live and\nbreathe it and I know your deep love for\nit so I want to thank you for um not\njust the brains that you put into it and\nthe energy you put into it but also for\nthe the heart that you put into it\nthanks for that Andrew I appreciate that\nwe we just want to help people we want\nto make things better well\nI know that to be true knowing you and\num thank you again for coming here today\nand I look forward to another round of\ndiscussion and um whenever the time\nhappens to be when these incredible\ntechnologies have um spelled out to the\nnext uh major Milestone thank you thank\nyou for joining me for today's\ndiscussion with Dr Matthew McDougall all\nabout the human brain and how it\nfunctions how it breaks down and the\nincredible efforts that are being\ncarried out at neurolink in order to\novercome diseases of brain and nervous\nsystem function and to augment how the\nhuman brain works if you'd like to learn\nmore about Dr mcdougall's work and the\nspecific work being done at neurolink\nplease see the links that we've provided\nin
