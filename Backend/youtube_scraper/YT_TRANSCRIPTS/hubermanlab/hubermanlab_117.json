    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: Welcome to the Huberman\nLab podcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we're discussing water.\nNow, to some of you, water might seem\nlike a boring topic, but I assure you\nthat water is anything but a boring topic.\nIn fact, water as a substance is\nincredibly interesting for a variety\nof reasons that I'll explain today.\nIn fact, we are going to discuss the\nphysics and chemistry of water, and\nI promise to make it accessible to\nanyone and everyone regardless of\nwhether or not you have a physics\nor chemistry background, and I will\ndiscuss how your body needs and\nutilizes water depending on what type\nof water you drink, the temperature of\nthat water, when you drink the water,\nand indeed how you drink that water.\nNow, water is actually a\npretty controversial topic.\nIn fact, in preparing for this episode,\nwhich took me several months, in\nfact, I ran into highly contradictory\ninformation and had to go on some real\ndeep dives in order to ferret out the\nbest and most accurate knowledge for you.\nI also found that there are generally\ntwo camps of people out there\nin terms of how they think about\nwater and the consumption of water.\nOne camp generally speaking, is of the\nmind that tap water is completely safe.\nPerhaps it needs a little bit of\nfiltering, but that in most areas\nof the world, if it runs out of the\ntap, and unless there's a warning\nsign directly above the faucet,\nthat you can drink the tap water.\nThe other camp seems to be the camp\nthat does not trust anything that comes\nout of the tap and is excited by and\nin fact, relies on things like reverse\nosmosis, deuterium depleted, hydrogen\nrich, or other forms of water that\nsometimes can be very expensive or at\nleast involve some substantial steps\nin order to clean, filter, alter the\nchemistry of, or in some other way, adjust\nbefore they are willing to consume it.\nSo today what we're going to try and do is\nto address all the stances around water.\nFor instance, we will discuss whether\nor not tap water is indeed safe, and I\nwill give you some tools that will allow\nyou to address whether or not the water\ncoming out of your tap is safe, as well\nas some tools that will allow you to\naddress how to clean that water if indeed\nit does need filtering and cleaning.\nIn particular for things like fluorides\nand endocrine disruptors, which it turns\nout, are quite prominent in a lot, not\nall, but a lot of tap water sources.\nI will also talk about the more\n\"esoteric forms of water\" that\nI mentioned a few minutes ago.\nSo I will go systematically through\nthe list of distilled reverse osmosis,\nspring water, deuterium depleted\nwater, high pH water, and for those\nof you that are already screaming out\nas you hear this, oh no, he's going\nto tell us that pH water can alter\nthe pH of our body in helpful ways.\nI'm not going to tell you that, but I will\ntell you that the alkalinity or acidity of\nthe water that is the pH of the water that\nyou drink has a profound impact on your\nability to absorb and utilize that water\nand the impact that those water molecules\nhave on specific biological systems.\nSo it turns out pH is very important,\nbut not for the reasons that you've\nprobably heard about previously.\nI'll talk about how the temperature of\nwater that you drink does indeed turn\nout to be important for the rate of\nabsorption of that water and its impact\non the cells, tissues, and organs of\nyour body, and thereby your health.\nAnd I will talk about various zero\ncost and low cost tools that you\ncan use in order to get the most\nout of the water that you drink.\nAnd finally, I will talk about when\nand how to hydrate your body best.\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\nI wanna share with you some very\ninteresting results that were just\npublished on the use of deliberate\ncold exposure to benefit fat loss.\nNow, deliberate cold exposure is a topic\nI've covered before on this podcast.\nWe have an entire episode about that, that\nI've linked in the show note captions.\nDeliberate cold exposure can be done\nby way of cold showers or immersion\nin cold or ice water up to the neck.\nThat's typically the ways that it's done.\nIt has been shown to reduce inflammation,\nto increase metabolism, and I think some\nof the most exciting results that have\nbeen published are the results certainly\nin humans showing that deliberate cold\nexposure can increase the release of\nso-called catecholamines, which are\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\nAnd those increases in those three\nmolecules are quite long lasting\nand lead to substantial increases in\nmood and focus throughout the day.\nNow, many people out there hear about\ndeliberate cold exposure and cringe.\nOther people hear about it and cringe\nbecause they've heard that deliberate cold\nexposure, especially by way of immersion\nin water, can block the adaptation\nto strength or hypertrophy training.\nWhat I mean by that is yes, indeed there\nare data showing that if one gets into\nvery cold water up to the neck in the six\nhours, anytime that is in the six hours\nafter strength or hypertrophy training,\nthat some of the strength and hypertrophy\nincreases that one would observe, are\nblocked by that deliberate cold exposure.\nHowever, after six hours does\nnot seem to be a problem.\nSo it can be done on other days besides\nthe strength and hypertrophy training.\nIt can be done before strength\nand hypertrophy training.\nIt can be done after endurance work.\nAnd I should mention that it does not\nappear that cold showers disrupt the\nadaptations to strength and hypertrophy\ntraining, even if they're done immediately\nafter strength or hypertrophy training.\nOkay, with that said, many people do enjoy\nthe effects of deliberate cold exposure,\nin particular for those increases in mood\nand alertness that are the consequence\nof those increases in the catecholamine,\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine.\nAnd again, those increases\nare very long lasting.\nSo it's not just during\nthe exposure to cold.\nIt is for several hours up to\nfour, maybe even five or six hours,\ndepending on how cold and how long the\ndeliberate cold exposure happens to be.\nAgain, there's a lot to say and\nexplore about deliberate cold exposure.\nSo again, I'll just refer you to the\nepisode on deliberate cold exposure.\nIf you want to explore the mechanisms\nand the positive health outcomes,\nsome of the controversies within\nthe data, etc., within that episode.\nMeanwhile, I definitely want to\nshare with you the results of this\nrecent study that just came out.\nThe title of this study is \"Impact\nof Cold Exposure on Life Satisfaction\nand Physical Composition of Soldiers\".\nThe reason this study is very interesting\nis that it's one of the few studies\nthat used, or I should say, explored\nboth deliberate cold exposure by\nimmersion in cold water, as well as\ndeliberate cold exposure by way of cold\nshowers as it relates to weight loss.\nNow, there's already data out there on\nthe effects of deliberate cold exposure\nand metabolism, and here I'm mainly\nreferring to the beautiful work of Dr.\nSusanna Søberg and colleagues in\nScandinavia that showed that people that\ndo 11 minutes total of deliberate cold\nexposure by immersion and cold water\nup to the neck per week, so 11 minutes\nper week total, spread out across some\ndifferent sessions by way of getting into\nwater that's uncomfortably cold up to the\nneck, and then getting out and then doing\nthat several times per week to hit that\n11 minutes or more threshold, and, this\nis very important, we'll come up in a\nmoment in the context of this new study,\nand warming up not by getting into a warm\nshower, which is frankly what I do after\nmy cold showers or getting into the ice\nbath or cold water immersion, but rather\nforcing their body to warm up naturally\nby using its own metabolic abilities.\nIn those studies, they observed\nsubstantial increases in brown fat stores,\nwhich are fat stores that you really want\naround the heart, and clavicles increases\nin metabolism that were quite dramatic\nin my opinion, and that could be very\nbeneficial for allowing people to feel\nmore comfortable at cold temperatures when\nthey're not in cold water and on and on.\nSo lots of benefits shown in that study.\nIn this study, what I thought was\nparticularly interesting is, again,\nthey explored both immersion in\ncold water and cold showers, and the\nduration of cold exposure that they\nfound led to substantial fat loss,\nespecially around the abdomen, was\nvery brief, deliberate cold exposure.\nLet me give you a few\ndetails about this study.\nThe study involved 49 subjects that\ninclude both males and females.\nThis is also really important.\nThe beautiful work of Susanna\nSøberg and colleagues, as far\nas I know, only looked at males.\nThis study looked at males and females.\nThey were 19 to 30 years old, and there\nbasically were two groups, people who\neither were assigned to get deliberate\ncold exposure, or they were not\nassigned to deliberate cold exposure.\nThe form of deliberate cold exposure\ninvolved one session per week of cold\nimmersion in cold water up to the neck.\nAnd to just give you a sense of\nhow cold it was, it was 3 degrees\nCelsius, which translates to\nabout 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThat's pretty darn cold, but\nit was only for two minutes.\nOkay, so one session at 3 degrees Celsius,\notherwise known as 37.4 degrees Fahrenheit\nfor two minutes every week, once a week.\nIn addition, the same subjects did\nfive cold showers per week, or a\nminimum of five cold showers per week.\nAnd those cold showers were\nslightly warmer than the\nimmersion in cold water condition.\nSo they were 10 degrees Celsius\napproximately, or 50 degrees\nFahrenheit, still pretty cold.\nAnd the duration of that cold\nwater exposure in the shower\nwas just for 30 seconds.\nOkay, so this is interesting to\nme because many people don't have\naccess to cold water immersion.\nThey might not have an ice bath\nor any place they can do that, but\nthey, most people do have access\nto a cold shower of some sort.\nPlus, I think most people could\ndo probably one ice bath per\nweek or find a place where they\ncould get into cold water safely.\nNow, I should point out that some\npeople will not do well going\ninto 37.5 degree Fahrenheit, aka 3\ndegrees Celsius water, having never\ndone anything like this before.\nSo if you're going to try and employ\nthese sorts of protocols that were used\nin the study, I do recommend that you\nease into it over the course of a week\nor so and become somewhat adapted to\nthe, the shock of cold water exposure.\nSo maybe start at, you know, 50\ndegrees Fahrenheit, kind of ease\nyour way back in terms of the\ncold water immersion, especially.\nNow, another critical feature of\nthis study is, as with the beautiful\nwork by Susanna Søberg, the subjects\nwere told to warm up naturally\nafter the deliberate cold exposure.\nSo they basically hung out outside of\nthe cold water immersion or outside of\nthe cold shower for 10 minutes after\nthey were exposed to the cold in their\nbathing suit, or I'm, I'm assuming they\nwere wearing something, but the point is\nthat you are not going from deliberate\ncold exposure directly into a hot shower\nor a sauna or something of that sort.\nSo again, their bodies were forced to heat\nup again naturally after the deliberate\ncold exposure, but after the 10 minute\nperiod, they were able to do whatever they\nwanted, essentially, reclothe, take a warm\nshower, and so on and go about their day.\nNow the results of this deliberate\ncold exposure protocol, again, 2\nminutes in cold immersion at 3 degrees\nCelsius, 37.5 degrees Fahrenheit,\nplus 5 cold showers per week of 2\nminutes long, a little bit warmer, 10\ndegrees Celsius, 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nNow, the deliberate cold exposure\nused in this study caused\nmany different statistically\nsignificant positive changes.\nThey had a very extensive questionnaire\nthat related to mood, everything\nfrom levels of anxiety to sexual\nsatisfaction, and on and on.\nIn fact, they saw a statistically\nsignificant improvement in sexual\nsatisfaction in the subjects that were\nexposed to deliberate cold exposure.\nNot in the control group, although they\ndidn't look at this, chances are those\nimprovements in sexual satisfaction\nwere the downstream consequence of\nthe known increases in testosterone\nand free testosterone that occur\nin both men and women who do the\nsorts of deliberate cold exposure.\nAgain, testosterone being an important\nhormone for libido in both men and women.\nThey also saw improvements in regulation\nof anxiety, which I think is very\ninteresting given that the deliberate\ncold exposure often causes people anxiety.\nBut here and in other studies we've\nseen it can lead to an better ability\nto buffer against anxiety in the\nnormal happenings of everyday life.\nPerhaps the most interesting and\nsignificant results that they found\nin the study however, were that in\nparticular in men, there was a reduction\nin waste circumference following 8\nweeks of this deliberate cold exposure,\nas well as a 5.5% on average, 5.5%\nreduction in abdominal fat, that\nwas quite statistically significant\nwhen compared to the other groups.\nNow, why there was no observed reduction\nin abdominal fat or waist circumference\nin the female subjects isn't clear.\nCould have to do with just the\nway that body fat is stored and\nmetabolized in females versus males.\nThat is going to be a topic\nfor future exploration.\nSo I do think the study is very\ninteresting because when you look at\nthe landscape of science and discussion\naround deliberate cold exposure, I\nthink there's a general consensus\nnow that deliberate cold exposure\ncan change one's sense of mood and\nwellbeing through this increases in\ncatecholamines that I mentioned earlier.\nBut the impact on metabolism itself has\nbeen somewhat controversial because the\noverall changes in metabolism that are\nobserved while statistically significant\nin many studies, have not ever really been\nshown to translate into weight loss or\nbody fat loss in any kind of specific way.\nAnd of course, a great advantage of this\nstudy is that by exploring soldiers,\nthey were able to really hold constant a\nnumber of other features like the amount\nof daily activity that those soldiers\nare exposed to, their diet, their living\nconditions, and so on and so forth.\nSo at least insofar as human\nstudies are done, it's a, it's\na very well controlled study.\nWe'll provide a link to the\nstudy in the show note captions.\nAnd for those of you that are thinking\nabout employing the protocol that's\nused in this particular paper, or\ncombining it with existing deliberate\ncold exposure protocols, to me it\nseems pretty straightforward in\nof pretty minimal time investment.\nJust 2 minutes of deliberate cold\nexposure by way of water immersion\nup to the neck, and 5 times a week\nof 30 seconds each of deliberate\ncold exposure by way of cold shower.\nAnd just a quick mention\nabout cold showers.\nIf you're going to use cold showers\nto do deliberate cold exposure,\nyou're going to want to stand\nunder the shower itself, right?\nAnd essentially have it hit your head,\nthe back of your neck and your upper\nback, which is where most of your\nbrown fat stores are concentrated.\nAnd it turns out that cold exposure to\nthose regions of the body in particular,\nare going to trigger the adaptation of\nincreased brown fat stores, which involves\nincreases in mitochondria in those fat.\nAgain, this is not the\nblubbery fat beneath the skin.\nThis is the fat that acts as kind of\nan oil in the furnace that is your\nthermogenic properties of your body to\ngenerate heat and burn off so-called white\nadipose tissue elsewhere in the body.\nNow, anyone that understands the laws\nof physics and thermodynamics will be\nsaying, wait, in order to get fat loss,\nyou need to have a caloric deficit.\nCalories in, calories out still applies.\nAnd yes, that's absolutely true.\nWe can only conclude on the basis of the\nresults of this study that the people that\nlost body fat were indeed in a caloric\ndeficit, presumably because all other\nfactors were held more or less constant\nin this group of soldiers, presumably\nbecause the deliberate cold exposure\nitself elevated metabolism, thereby\nincreasing the calories out component of\nthe calories in calories out equation,\nwhich of course, governs the rules of\nweight loss and body fat loss as well.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthis podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink with\neverything you need and nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of salt,\nmagnesium and potassium, the\nso-called electrolytes and no sugar.\nNow, salt, magnesium, and potassium\nare critical to the function of\nall the cells in your body, in\nparticular to the function of your\nnerve cells, also called neurons.\nIn fact, in order for your neurons\nto function properly, all three\nelectrolytes need to be present in the\nproper ratios, and we now know that\neven slight reductions in electrolyte\nconcentrations or dehydration of\nthe body can lead to deficits in\ncognitive and physical performance.\nLMNT contains a science backed\nelectrolyte ratio of 1000 milligrams.\nThat's one gram of sodium, 200\nmilligrams of potassium, and\n60 milligrams of magnesium.\nI typically drink LMNT first thing in\nthe morning when I wake up in order\nto hydrate my body and make sure I\nhave enough electrolytes and while\nI do any kind of physical training\nand after physical training as well,\nespecially if I've been sweating a lot.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT, you\ncan go to drinklmnt, that's\nlmnt.com/huberman to claim a free\nLMNT sample pack with your purchase.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nNow, nootropics is a\nword that I don't like.\nI don't like it because it means\nsmart drugs and as a neuroscientist\nwe know that we have brain circuits\nfor focus, brain circuits that enable\ncreativity, brain circuits that\nallow task switching and on and on.\nSo there's really no such thing as\na brain circuit for being smart.\nNow, Thesis understands this and has\ndesigned custom nootropics that are\ndesigned to get your brain and body\ninto the optimal state for the specific\ntypes of work that is physical or\ncognitive work that you want to do.\nI've been using thesis for more\nthan a year now, and it's completely\nchanged the way that I approach work.\nI typically take the clarity formula\nprior to doing any kind of cognitive\nwork, and I'll take their energy\nformula often before workouts.\nIf you'd like to try your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit, you can go\nonline to takethesis.com/huberman and\ntake their brief three minute quiz.\nThat quiz will allow them to send you\nfour different trial formulas that\nyou can use for a month, and then\nyou can iterate with them to find\nthe ideal Nootropic formulas for you.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by HVMN Ketone IQ.\nKetone IQ is a ketone supplement\nthat increases blood ketones.\nNow, many people have heard of\nthe ketogenic diet, and indeed\nthe ketogenic diet has been\nuseful for many people out there.\nHowever, most people out there, including\nmyself, do not follow a ketogenic\ndiet that is I eat carbohydrates.\nHowever, it's important to note\nthat even if you are not on a\nketogenic diet, you can benefit\nfrom increasing your blood ketones.\nIn fact, I'll use Ketone IQ after lunch\nor in the afternoon with some coffee or\nsometimes first thing in the morning.\nIf I'm particularly hungry and I\nwant to do exercise or I want to do\ncognitive work, but I want to delay\nmy first meal using Ketone IQ allows\nme to curb my hunger and gives me a\nlot of focus and energy, and that's\nbecause ketones are one of the brain's\npreferred fuels for cognitive work.\nIn fact, ketones have been shown to be\nassociated with four brain function,\nwhich is associated with context switching\nfocus and formulations of strategies, etc.\nAll the sorts of things that are\nimportant for doing deliberate\nfocused work or physical performance.\nIf you'd like to try Ketone IQ\nyou can go to hvmn.com/huberman\nto save 20% off your order.\nAgain, that's hvmn.com/huberman.\nThe huberman Lab podcast is now\npartnered with Momentous supplements.\nTo find the supplements we discuss\non the Huberman Lab podcast, you\ncan go to livemomentous spelled\nO-U-S livemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just mention that\nthe library of those supplements\nis constantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about water, and\nlet's start off by answering\nthe question, what is water?\nWater is of course H₂O, most everybody\nknows that from an early age, but what\nH₂O means is that each molecule of water\nconsists of two hydrogens and one oxygen.\nNow, the physical arrangement of those\ntwo hydrogens and one oxygen turns out\nto be really important for how water\nfunctions in the body, and frankly,\nelsewhere in our world and life, if\nyou were to make a peace symbol, that\nis to put up your index finger and\nyour middle finger simultaneously.\nIn fact, I'm gonna recommend you do\nthat now, unless you're using your\nhands for something else important.\nIn which case do it later.\nWell, if you make that piece symbol and\nyou look at your hand, you have a pretty\ngood impression of what an individual\nwater molecule consists of, which is\nH₂O two hydrogens and an oxygen and,\nwith that piece symbol, the fingers\nor the tips of your fingers rather\nare gonna represent the hydrogens.\nYour fingers, that is the length of each\nof those fingers is going to represent\nthe electron bonds to the oxygen and the\npalm of your hand and the fingers that are\ndown are going to represent the oxygen.\nOkay?\nNow, what's important about\nthat visual impression or visual\nimage of the individual water\nmolecule is that it is polarized.\nThat is the hydrogen's over on one side.\nBoth of them are over on one side\nand the oxygen is over on another.\nAnd what's really important about\nwater molecules being polarized is\nthat they can bind to one another\nby way of that polarization.\nAnd this has to do with something that\nwe all kind of learned in chemistry\nat one point, but many of us forgot.\nMaybe we didn't even understand it\nthe first time around, which is that\npositives and negatives attract.\nSo when you have individual water\nmolecules, they have the opportunity\nto interact and essentially bind to\none another and they bind through\nwhat are called covalent bonds.\nCovalent bonds are relatively weak\nbonds, and so as a consequence,\nwater can change its confirmation.\nHowever, covalent bonds are strong enough\nthat water actually can maintain some\nstructure and that structure will vary,\nof course, depending on its temperature.\nSo, what you need to know about\nwater is that indeed it consists\nof lots of individual H₂O , and\nthose H₂O  can arrange themselves in\ndifferent ways, and that temperature\nis a strong determinant of the\narrangement of those water molecules.\nThat is, they're bonding to one another.\nAnd in fact, even they're\nspacing between those bonds.\nSo again, even if you don't have\nany chemistry, stay with me because\nyou'll definitely understand this.\nWater can exist in at least\n3 forms and maybe 4 forms.\nWe know that it can be liquid, of course.\nThat's really what normally what\nwe think of when we think of water.\nIt can be gas, so we\nthink of steam, right?\nSo if you heat it up, it takes on a  not\na semi-solid or a semi-liquid form, it\ntakes on this property of steam or gas.\nOkay?\nSo when you see steam or when you\nbreathe on a cold day through your\nmouth or through your nose and you see\nyour air, those are water molecules\nthat are condensing, that is bonding\nin certain ways, based on differences\nin temperature between the inside\nof your body and the outside air.\nAnd of course it can be\na solid, it can be ice.\nNow, ice is fascinating and important\nin understanding how water works, and\nthis will become relevant later when\nwe think about how water works within\nthe body as well, especially how\ndifferent temperatures of water impact\nthe health and behavior of our cells.\nAnd the most important point to understand\nabout water in its solid state is that\nunlike most substances when water is\nin its solid state, it is actually less\ndense than when it's in its liquid state.\nSo just think about that.\nMost substances, like most metals,\nfor instance, when they are in a\nsolid state, they're more dense\nthan when they're in a liquid state.\nSo, for instance, if they're in a solid\nstate, they will sink in a container\nfilled with their liquid form, not water.\nWater is very interesting because\nas you cool water and water\ntransitions from a liquid to a solid.\nIt still binds.\nThat is, it can form bonds between those\ndifferent molecules of water, but the\nspacing between those H₂O , so again,\nthose peace symbols with hands, so if you\nhad a bunch of those, so if you had, you\nknow, a thousand hands all making peace\nsymbols, they can bond to one another.\nBut when it's cold, those\nbonds are actually made\nfurther apart from one another.\nAnd as a consequence, ice, as\nwe all know, floats in water.\nIn other words, put very simply, water\nis unusual and special in that, in its\nsolid form ice, it is actually less\ndense than when it's in its liquid form.\nAnd that's why ice floats in water.\nNow this is important not just to\nour biology, but to all of life.\nBecause if you think about it, if it were\nnot the case that water is less dense\nin its solid form ice than it is in its\nliquid form, the bottoms of our oceans\nwould be covered with thick sheets of ice.\nAnd if that were the case, you can be\nabsolutely sure that life would not\nexist on our planet the way that it does.\nAnd there's a good chance that we would\nnot exist as a species because so much\nof what allows us to exist on  this\nplanet and the other animals to exist\non this planet, relies on photosynthesis\npathways in plants that are dependent on\nthe sun and interactions with the oceans\nand lakes and other bodies of water.\nAnd of course, the ice\ncaps are vitally important.\nThat is the presence of ice,\nespecially at the poles.\nBut elsewhere,  in bodies of water as\nwell, so-called icebergs are a critical\npart of the ecosystem that allows\nfor everything from photosynthesis\nto the ability of certain animals\nto extract food from each other\nand from their local resources.\nNow, there's a whole discussion to be\nhad there, but the important point for\nnow is that the physical properties of\nthe bonds between water that are made and\nchanged depending on temperature, turn\nout to be essential for us to be present\non this planet at all and for our cells\nto function in the ways that they do for\nsake of health and for sake of disease.\nAnd we'll explore this later when we\ntalk about the critical relationship\nbetween temperature pH, which is the\nrelationship between alkalinity, how\nbasic or acidity, how acid a given\nliquid, or in this case we're gonna\nbe talking about water is and the ways\nthat our cells can or can't use water.\nSo I realize that this is fairly in\ndepth for those of you that don't have\nmuch of a background in chemistry.\nI've tried to keep it really top contour,\nbut if you can make a piece symbol or if\nyou can just imagine a piece symbol in\nyour mind and realize that that's a water\nmolecule and that those water molecules\ncombine to one another through bonds that\nare relatively strong, but weak enough\nthat they can be broken if they need\nto, and that the temperature that those\nwater molecules are exposed to changes\nthe distance between those bonds and\nthat's what allows ice to float in water,\nthen you are gonna have no problem with\nthe remainder of the discussion today.\nIn fact, You will also have the ability\nto understand things that you've observed\nmany times over, but perhaps have never\nthought about or really understood,\nwhich are, for instance, that water\nhas a certain level of surface tension.\nFor instance, if you've ever been to\nthe ocean and the waves are coming in,\nwhat you'll notice is if you walk on\nthe dry sand or gravel,  pebbles that\nis of the ocean, it's very easy, right?\nI mean, the pebbles move\ndown or the sand moves down.\nIt depresses a little bit due\nto the weight of your body.\nBut as you get closer to the water,\nyou're gonna sink deeper because that\nsand is more saturated with water.\nBut at some point, you won't be able to\nactually walk on top of the water, right?\nIt has been said that\nJesus walked on water.\nThere's the so-called Jesus Christ\nlizard so named because it can\nactually walk on the surface of water.\nA leaf can float on the surface\nof water under some conditions.\nA coin can float on the surface of water.\nIf you make coffee in the morning, you\ncan actually take a spoonful of that\nhot coffee and pour a little bit on\nthe surface of your coffee, and you'll\nnotice that it will bead up, and  you'll\nget little round spheres of water.\nThose are little water molecules bound\nto one another that spin on top of\nthe surface before they sink under.\nThat has everything to do with\nthe bonding between water that's\ndependent on temperature, but\nalso as with the difficulty for\nessentially everybody, to walk on\nwater or for animals to walk on water.\nThe surface tension of water\nallows certain things to float\nthere or to stay at the surface.\nBut there's a very thin layer of\nwater molecules at the surface of\nwater that are more dense than the\nwater that resides at deeper depths.\nAnd that's why most things,\nincluding us sink in water,\nwe are more dense than water.\nNow, I did mention earlier that\nthere are 3 forms of water.\nThose are the ones that we all\nare familiar with, the solid\nliquid and gas forms of water.\nHowever, there are data mainly from\nGerald Pollack laboratory at the\nUniversity of Washington that have\ndescribed the so-called fourth phase\nof water, which is structured water.\nAnd we'll get into this a little bit\nlater because structured water has really\nbeen a prominent topic in the, let's\ncall it the water health aficionados.\nIt's a heavily debated topic as\nto whether or not structured water\nis somehow better for ourselves\nif it exists within our bodies.\nWe'll get into that in full detail later.\nBut the whole notion of structured\nwater is that in the presence of\ncertain solids or certain liquids, the\nconfirmation of water that is the water\nmolecules actually change somewhat.\nThis has been demonstrated.\nWhether or not it has relevance\nto the biological function of\nour body is a different issue.\nBut we know that there is this fourth\nphase of water called structured water.\nStructured water is a fairly complicated\ntopic, but we can make it very simple\nfor sake of today's discussion.\nI mentioned earlier that opposite\npolls attract that is positives and\nnegatives attract, and typically,\nthings that are negatively charged\nwhen presented with another negative\ncharge either repel or don't attract.\nThings that are positively\ncharged in the presence of another\npositive charge also tend to repel.\nThis is the basis of magnets,\neither sticking to one another\nor repelling from one another.\nThere's also the idea that human\nbeings who are opposites attract,\nbut that's a different episode\nthat we need to do in the future.\nThe point here is that structured\nwater is a unique condition in which\nthe local environment that these\nwater molecules happen to be in allows\npositive charges between different\nwater molecules to attract one another.\nSo again, whereas normally it's\npositive and negatives that\nattract in the configuration\nthat we call structured water.\nPositives and positives attract\nand form bonds that are stronger\nthan the typical bonds that would\nbe formed between water molecules.\nAnd just as it kind of prelude to our\ndiscussion about structured water,\nas it may or may not relate to health\nlater, there are a number of people that\nbelieve that within the body, because\nof the presence of certain liquids\nand solids, that the water within our\ncells, and in particular within the\ninteractions with so-called organelles,\norganelles are things like mitochondria.\nThe Golgi apparatus,\nthey have fancy names.\nThese are, these are the things\nwithin cells that allow cells to do\neverything from make proteins to traffic\nproteins out to the surface of cells.\nThings like neurotransmitters\nand receptors and so on.\nA lot of people who are interested\nin structured water as it relates to\nbiological function, have I hypothesized\nor like to debate rather whether or not\nin the body water is not just present\nin its liquid form or gaseous form.\nWe know it's not present in its\nsolid form unless you gulp down\nsome ice cubes, for instance.\nBut, There is a cohort of people out\nthere, including some fairly accomplished\nscientists that believe that within the\nbody, the organelles of our cells act as\na substrate for water to exist in this\nfourth form, this structured water form.\nAnd that's led to this whole\nniche industry of people,  who are\nproponents of consuming so-called\nstructured water, and  again, we'll\nget to that a little bit later.\nSo now you know what individual water\nmolecules consist of when you hear H₂O\nhopefully you'll get that visual image\nin your mind of an individual water\nmolecule being the peace symbol and a\nbunch of those binding to one another\nthrough these relatively weak bonds,\nbut strong enough that certain things\ncan take place like surface tension.\nKeep in mind that surface tension of\nwater may relate to either standard\nbonds between water or this fourth phase.\nThat's heavily debated still, but we\ncertainly know that for instance, if\nyou were to take a piece of wax paper\nor glass and you were to pour some\nwater on it, you would notice that\nthe water would beat up or kind of\naggregate at particular locations.\nWhen you see that beating up\nor the aggregation of water\nmolecules on a particular\nsurface, you're seeing two things.\nThis is actually kind of fun.\nThe next time you see it, you'll know\nthat the, the aggregation, the beating\nup of water with itself, so individual\nwater molecules or many water molecules\nkind of aggregating at one location\nand making a bead of water that's due\nto these bonds, these covalent bonds\noccurring between water molecules.\nAlso, you'll notice that on a vertical\npane of glass, say in rain or on your\nwindshield, that the water will look\nalmost like it's sticking to the glass.\nAnd that's because there are actually\nbonds between the water molecules that\nhave beat it up themselves and the glass.\nSo water can not just bind to itself.\nIt can also bind to certain surfaces.\nAnd the fact that perhaps if you drive\nyour car, if you were to tap the window,\nor if a big enough bead of water formed on\na window that it would start to drip down.\nAnd that's because those bonds with\nthe surface are strong, but they're\nnot so strong that it stick at that\nlocation quite different than water\nthat is in its solid form ice that can\nactually really adhere if you've ever\nhad to scrape ice off a windshield.\nSo for you, those of you who live in\ncold regions, you're familiar with this,\nscrape ice off a windshield, you realize\nthat the bonds between water in its solid\nform and different services is quite\na bit stronger than the bonds between\ndifferent water molecules with each other.\nOr the bonds between water and\ndifferent surfaces when they're warmer.\nOkay, so I do realize that for a lot\nof people listening, that's gonna be\na pretty deep dive into the chemistry\nand physical properties of water.\nBut all you really need to know is that\nthese water molecules are incredibly\nversatile and can bind to each other,\nand can bind to different surfaces,\nand can allow things to float or to\nsink or even to move across surfaces of\nwater based on the three, perhaps four\ndifferent,  states that water can be in.\nAnd that versatility that you observe in\nthe natural world on window pans and rain\nand clouds and hail and ice and snow and\nscraping ice off your windshield in the\ncold of winter and perspiration and so on.\nAll of that is fine and good, but\nrealize that almost all of those same\nsorts of properties of water become\nextremely relevant when thinking about\nhow your body actually utilizes water.\nAnd the key thing here is that temperature\nand the so-called alkalinity or acidity\nthat is the pH of water turn out to\nbe very important determinants of how\nwater is used by the cells of your body.\nIn fact, as I'll describe in a moment, we\nhave entire sets of biological mechanisms\nsolely devoted to trying to get water into\nour cells in very specific ways, including\nat specific rates and to use water in\ndifferent ways because as you've probably\nheard before, we are mostly water.\nWhat's kind of interesting to me and\nwhat I found researching this episode\nis that the percentages of our cells\nand bodies that are  purported to\nbe water is a pretty broad range.\nSome people say we're 55% water.\nOther people will say We're 70% water.\nSome people will say We're 95% water.\nThe exact percentage\ndoesn't matter so much.\nAnd really just boils down to whether\nor not the person that's stating that\npercentage is talking about how much\nwater is present in our cells and body\nat a given moment versus how much water\nwas involved in the process of creating\nthe sorts of proteins and other things\nof our body that are required to have\nhair, cell skin cells, brain cells, etc.\nSo if you really want a number out\nthere,  I can't give you a single\nnumber if you wanna be accurate,\nit's gonna have to be a range.\nAnd basically we are anywhere\nfrom 70% to 90% water depending\non how you define being water.\nThat is whether or not you're talking\nabout water being present in cells\nin its liquid form or maybe in\nthis fourth structure water form.\nIf you're,  of the mind that that\nexists within us and whether or not\nyou're talking about water that was\nused to create a given protein, like\na receptor or a neurotransmitter, or\nwhether or not you're talking about\nthe water, just being water as H₂O.\nOkay, so again, it's very easy to go\ndown that rabbit hole, and this is\npart of the reason why there's such\na wide discrepancy of assertions\nas to how much of us is water.\nBut let's be direct.\nMost of our body is water, and there\nisn't a single other molecule in the\nuniverse that we can look to and say that\nit has as important a role in our health\nand biology and frankly, our presence\nof life on earth at all than water.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called Ag\nOne is a Vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic Greens\nsince 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking Athletic\nGreens, and the

travel packs and\nthe year supply of Vitamin D3 K2.\nOkay, so now at a minimum, everyone\nout there should understand that\nwater has a particular structure.\nSo when you hear H₂O, you can kind of\nimagine that structure and that the water\nmolecules can change their confirmation.\nThat is they can bind to other water\nmolecules and it turns out they bind\nto other things and actually change\nthe confirmation of other things.\nA good example of that is something\nwe're all familiar with, which is\nwater's ability to dissolve certain\nsubstances like sugar or salt.\nAnd that is because salt\nmolecules or sugar molecules\nare what we call hydrophilic.\nThey like water.\nAnd when we say they like water, it just\nmeans that the chemical structure of\nsalt, sodium, or the chemical structure\nof say, sucrose like table sugar, can\nactually interact with the hydrogens\nand oxygens of water and can change\nthose salt molecules or sugar molecules,\nturning them from solid into liquid.\nEssentially creating what are called\nsolids, which is basically  the dissolving\nof solids into liquid solutions.\nIn fact, water is one of the\nbest solvents on the planet.\nIn fact, water is better at\ndissolving many solids than is acid.\nAll right?\nThat's how incredible water is.\nAnd there are a number of reasons\nrelated to the chemistry of\nwater that can explain that.\nBut as we transition from talking about\nthe physics and chemistry of water to\nhow water actually behaves within our\nbody and contributes to our health or\nto disease depending on the case, it's\nimportant to understand that molecules\nsuch as sugar and salt can be hydrophilic.\nOr as we know, oil and water don't mix.\nThat's because oil's, lipids\nare so-called hydrophobic.\nWhat's hydrophobic?\nWe'll, just think \"Ahh\" phobic.\nCertain molecules such as lipids\ndon't dissolve well in water.\nAnd we all intuitively understand\nthat if you take some olive oil, for\ninstance, and you put it into a little\nglass of water, it'll likely float or\nbeat up or form little spherical or\namoeba like shapes within the water.\nAnd that's because oil\nlipids are hydrophobic.\nSo different substances out there are\neither going to be more hydrophilic.\nThat is they are going to have a greater\npropensity to interact with water and\nbind with the different aspects of\nthe water molecules or hydrophobic to\nhave less of a propensity to interact\nwith and bind with water molecules.\nAnd I've sort of been alluding to this\nnumerous times throughout this podcast\nalready, the temperature of water and\nthe pH that is the alkalinity or acidity\nof water will have a strong impact\non whether or not a hydrophilic or\nhydrophobic substance will have a greater\nor lesser tendency to interact with water.\nYou all know this intuitively as well.\nIf you've ever tried to dissolve say\na big tablespoon of sugar in very cold\nwater, you'll notice that the grains don't\ndissolve as quickly as when you take that\nbig tablespoon of sugar and put it into\na warm or hot cup of water, and that's\nbecause the temperature of water actually\nchanges how well that sugar molecule\nis able to change its confirmation\nand interact with the water molecules.\nLikewise, if you want to get something\nthat's really hydrophilic into an\naqueous, that is a water containing\nsolution, the temperature is also\ngoing to strongly impact that.\nNow, there are a near infinite\nnumber of examples of how temperature\nin pH impact the tendency of\nhydrophilic and hydrophobic substances\nto dissolve in water or not.\nWe're not gonna go into all those details,\nbut as we migrate from our discussion\nabout the physics and chemistry of water\ninto how water behaves within our body,\nwhich is what we're gonna do now, and then\nas we continue into the third part of our\ndiscussion, which is why and how certain\ntypes of water that some of you are\nfamiliar with, like different pH water,\ndistilled water, reverse osmosis water,\nwhy those different types of water are\nthought to and in some cases do in fact\nchange the ways that our cells function,\nfor better or for worse, all of that will\ncome together and make sense for you.\nOkay?\nSo all the cells of your body, every cell,\neven your bones, that is the osteoblasts\nand the other cells within your bones,\nyour bone marrow, your red blood cells,\nyour white blood cells, your neurons,\nyour nerve cells, your liver cells, your\nkidney cells, all of them require water.\nIn order to get the proper amount of water\ninto those cells, there are basically two\nways that water can access those cells.\nNow, if we zoom out for a second\nand ask ourselves, how does\nwater actually get into the body?\nMost of us just think, oh, well,\nwe drink that water into our body.\nOf course, that's the main way we\ncan also breathe water molecules\ninto our body through humid air.\nWhen you hydrate your cells, that is when\nyou're bringing water into your cells,\nthat water needs to move from your gut and\ninto the bloodstream and eventually into\nthe individual cells, whatever cell type\nthat may be, and they're basically two\nways that water can access those cells.\nThe first way has been known\nabout for a very long time, and\nthat is so-called diffusion.\nNow, the outside of most cells\nis made up of fatty stuff, lipid.\nSo for instance, neurons, nerve\ncells have a lipid bilayer.\nIt's two layers of fat, and you already\nknow that fat lipid is very hydrophobic.\nOkay?\nNow that turns out to be not a\nproblem, but a solution for how water\ncan get across that lipid barrier.\nWhy?\nIt is the fact that water can change its\nconfirmation and lipids can change their\nconfirmation just enough so that the\nbonds between water and the bonds between\nthose hydrophobic lipids can interact,\nallowing the water molecule to basically\npass through the lipid because it can\nbond very weakly or in some cases, not at\nall, but very weakly to those lipids and\nthen be pushed through to the other side.\nReally incredible.\nIf you think about it, if there was too\nmuch of a hydrophobic relationship between\nthe lipid and the water, the water would\ncome up to the surface of that fatty\noutside  of our cells, and then would\nbe repelled away from it, or it would\njust stay there right at the surface.\nAnd that would be no good because\nwe actually need that water to\ndiffuse across the cell membranes, or\nactually it's a double cell membrane,\nas I mentioned before, two layers.\nSo water and lipids of cells can\ninteract with just enough affinity\nthat the water molecule can diffuse\nacross those cell membrane barriers.\nBut, and this is an important but, the\ndiffusion of water molecules across\nthose lipid barriers on the outsides of\ncells is a fairly slow process compared\nto the other way that water accesses\ncells and this other way that water\naccesses cells is really something that\nwas just discovered about 10 years ago.\nSo this is a fairly recent discovery,\nbut turns out to be a fundamental\ndiscovery, which is the presence\nof water called aquaporin channels.\nAquaporin channels are basically portals\nthrough the membrane that allow water\nmolecules to move very quickly across cell\nmembranes at a rate of about 1 million\nH₂O, 1 million water molecules per second.\nAnd the way that water molecules move\nacross the cell membrane through those\naquaporin channels is very interesting.\nThe inside of those channels,\nand the way you think of these\nis they're literally tubes stuck\nthrough the membranes of cells.\nThe insides of those channels are\nvery hydrophobic, allowing those\nwater molecules to just jot really\nquickly and almost as if in your\nmind, you can just imagine as if it\nwas sort of lubricated for the water.\nAlthough it's not really lubricated,\nthe the water molecules can move through\nin single file a million per second.\nNow, why would you need two ways for\nwater to get across cell membranes?\nOne fairly slow through  basic diffusion,\nand again, diffusion folks is the movement\nof things from a gradient of higher\nconcentration to lower concentration,\nwhich you just think about this as\nthings tend to run downhill from higher\nconcentration to lower concentration.\nThey try and create\nequilibrium  across space.\nSo, you know, if you had a bunch\nof marbles on one side  of a box,\nthey're just imagine that these\nwere water molecules because of the\ncharges between those hydrogens and\noxygens, there's a tendency for those\nmarbles to spread out and essentially\ntake on a fairly even confirmation.\nThat's basically just\ndiffusion across a space.\nWater molecules will also move\nfrom higher concentration to lower\nconcentration cross cell membranes,\nand then you have these portals, these\ntubes or these channels as they're\ncalled, these aquaporin channels where\nwater molecules can move very quickly.\nNow, the reason why biology seems to\nhave created these aquaporin channels,\nand again, I wasn't consulted the design\nphase, but the most logical explanation\nis that we have many tissues within our\nbody that often need water very quickly\nor need to release water very quickly.\nLet's think about a couple of these\nand then let's look at what the\nactual distribution of aquaporin\nchannels is throughout the body.\nWhat is an area of your body that\non occasion will need to move\nwater very quickly out of it?\nYou can use your imagination here, but\nI'll just tell you that for instance,\nyour tear glands or tear ducts\nneed to release tears very quickly.\nSo you need to take water that's stored\nin your body if there's an emotional\nexperience or if you look at a very bright\nlight, for instance or you know, God\nforbid if you get some sort of irritant in\nyour eye, you're gonna start to tear up.\nAnd those tears are the release\nof fluid from those tear ducts.\nAnd so it's gonna be the very rapid\nrelease of water from those tear ducts\nthrough so-called aquaporin channels.\nAnd in fact, aquaporin\nchannels are heavily expressed.\nThere are many of them in the\ncells of the so-called lacrimal\nglands that release tears.\nIn addition, we need to\nabsorb water from the gut.\nAnd the gut has a lining, endothelial\nlining and other cell lining and\nmucosal lining and water needs\noften to move very quickly from our\nstomach into the rest of the body.\nAnd one way that is accomplished\nis through aquaporin channels that\nare expressed all along your gut.\nSo, the discovery of these aquaporin\nchannels is really highly significant\nin terms of understanding the different\nways that water can interact with\nand get into the cells of your body.\nNow, there are aquaporin channels,\nnot just in the lacrimal glands that\nallow for tearing or within the gut,\nbut in many tissues within your body.\nAnd there even have different\ndistributions within those tissues.\nIn fact, as one looks at the\nexpression of the different aquaporin\nchannels, cause it turns out\nthere are different forms of them.\nAcross all the cells\nand tissues of the body.\nThere's really no single tissue\nwithin the body, except perhaps\nthe bones of your body and perhaps\nthe ligaments to some extent, that\ndon't have these aquaporin channels.\nSome of you out there may have\nheard of the so-called fascia,\nfascia and sheath muscles.\nThey're unique kind of connective\ntissue that gives some pliability\nand yet some rigidity that allow\nfor a lot of the physical abilities\nof your musculoskeletal system.\nIt's incredible tissue.\nWe'll do an entire episode\nabout fascia at some point.\nFascinating, fascinating tissue fascia,\neven contained aquaporin channels.\nSo the role of aquaporin channels\nin fascia probably relates to\nour specific needs to be able\nto use specific muscle groups in\nparticular ways at particular times.\nIn other words, if you're sleeping\nor lying down or sitting, you're not\nusing your musculoskeletal system\nas much as if you're running or\nperforming some repetitive behavior.\nIt turns out that the aquaporin channels\nin certain tissues, like the fascia\ncan be used when we transition from\nlow mobility states to high mobility\nstates, allowing more perfusion\nor access of water into particular\ncells of the body when we need it.\nSuch as fascinating, fascinating channels.\nThese aquaporin channels, and again,\nonly discovered fairly recently,\nso we're still learning new things\nabout our biology all the time.\nNow, in a very important feature of\nthe Aquaporin channel is that the\nmovement of water molecules across the\ncell membrane through those aquaporin\nchannels is strongly dependent on the\ntemperature of water and the pH of water.\nThis becomes especially important in\nour description and our deep dive into\nso-called alkaline water or higher\npH water a little bit later, but I'll\njust give you a little teaser for\nnow because I'm sure that a number of\npeople are, are wondering about this.\nIf you go into the store or even a\nconvenient store, you will see pH water.\nNow, every water has a pH, right?\nLower numbers mean more acidic.\nHigher numbers mean more\nalkaline, or more basic.\nYou'll see pH water.\nThat is 7.4.\nYou'll see 7.8, you'll see 9.8.\nYou'll see a huge range of these things,\nand there are many, many different claims\nabout how the pH of water is important\nfor regulating the pH of the body.\nHere's the real story.\nThe pH of your body, that is\nthe pH of the cells at different\nlocations in your body, is strongly,\nstrongly homeostatically regulated.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nIt means it doesn't change that much,\nwhich means that you have very specific\nbiological mechanisms that ensure the\npH is maintained, for instance, in the\nskin cells of your skin, in the retinal\ncells of your eye, in your brain cells.\nNow, It is true that across the\nbody, different cells and tissues\nhave fairly widely varying pH.\nYou know, it has been said that\nthe pH of bodily tissues is\ngenerally between 7.2 and 7.4.\nHowever, if you were to look at the\npH of your gut, and keep in mind that\nyour gut is not just your stomach, your\ngut is the entire pathway ranging from\nyour throat all the way down to where\nyou excrete things out of your body.\nThat entire pathway has different\npH levels depending on where you are\nalong the gut and intestinal pathway.\nAnd in fact, having much lower that\nis more acidic pH at certain locations\nalong your gut pathway is what allows\nthose gut microbiota, those little\nmicroorganisms of which you have trillions\nthat are important for regulating\neverything from neurotransmitter\nproduction to hormone production that\nallow them to flourish and do well.\nThat said, except under conditions of\nhemorrhage or changes in blood volume\nthat are of a dangerous level that can\nlead to seizure or even death, the pH\nof the rest of the cells of your body,\nand also those gut cells doesn't change\nthat much on a moment to moment basis.\nSo if somebody tells you that you\nshould drink alkaline water or alkalized\nwater as it's sometimes called, In\norder to keep your body more alkaline\nand less acidic, there is essentially\nno basis for that at a macroscopic\nlevel or even at a local level.\nNow, what that does not mean is\nthat the pH of the water that\nyou drink is not important.\nIn fact, if the pH of the water that\nyou drink is too low, that is if the\nwater that you consume is too acidic,\nit will not move as quickly from your\ngut into the other regions of your\nbody, and therefore, the other cells of\nyour body that require that water will\nnot be able to access it as readily.\nYou've probably experienced this if you've\nconsumed certain water and it feels like\nit's sloshing around in your stomach or\nit feels like it's just somehow staying\nthere, or you feel it, its presence\nmore, not just as volume, but it's almost\nas if you can feel the little waves\nof water along the inside of your gut.\nNow, sometimes that can relate to\ntemperature, but oftentimes that\ncan relate to the pH of that water,\nand it turns out it is true that\nwater that is more alkaline, that is\npHs of 7.4 or higher can move more\nreadily across the Aquaporin channel.\nAnd in terms of absorption of water\nfrom the endothelial lining and\nthe other cell type lining of your\ngut into the rest of your body.\nIt is true that higher pH water provided\nthat pH isn't too high, is going to be\nabsorbed more quickly, which partially\nexplains why some people have an\naffinity for this higher pH water.\nNow, this is not to say that you\nneed to consume high pH water in\norder to hydrate your body properly.\nI want to be very clear about that.\nHowever, if you are interested\nin what the value of elevated pH\nwater is, it largely has to do\nwith this accelerated absorption.\nAnd as we'll talk about a little bit\nlater, there is also growing evidence\nthat it can adjust the function of\ncertain cells that are within your\nimmune system and thereby reduce\ncertain inflammatory responses.\nSo I realize as I'm saying this, some\npeople out there will probably think, oh\nno, this guy's like a pH water proponent.\nHe's saying we have to drink alkaline\nwater or buy very fancy water.\nNow, I want to be clear that is not\nwhat I'm saying, and I'm also not saying\nthat you need to purchase very expensive\nwater in order to derive the maximum\nbenefits from the water that you drank.\nIt turns out there are a few things that\nyou can do by way of temperature and by\nway of filtering water and a few other\ntricks that I'll tell you a little bit\nlater that will allow you to increase\nthe absorption rate of water in the gut,\nwhich turns out to be a very interesting,\nbut also potentially important thing to\ndo for not just reducing inflammation,\nbut also making sure that you're getting\nproper hydration of different cell types\nin your body, including rapid hydration\nof your brain cells, which as we'll\nalso talk about in a few moments, can\ngreatly enhance cognitive function.\nOkay, so we've talked about\nhow water can get into cells.\nThere are two ways, diffusion and\nmovement through these aquaporin channels.\nWe've earmarked the discussion that\nthe temperature and the pH of water,\nthat is the confirmation of water.\nAnd here I really want to embed this in\npeople's minds, that when we talk about\ntemperature of water and pH of water,\nwe're really talking about the arrangement\nof those H₂O, those water molecules.\nSo keep that in mind.\nWe've covered how water can get\ninto cells through those two\ndifferent ways, diffusion and\nthrough the aquaporin channels.\nWhat we haven't talked about is what\nhappens to water once it's in cells,\nand this is very simple to explain.\nOnce water is inside of cells, it's\ngoing to be incorporated into the\ndifferent proteins and organelles.\nAgain, organelles are things like\nmitochondria, the nucleus of the cells,\nwhich is contained to the DNA and so\nforth in different ways, depending\non which proteins are there and how\nhydrophilic or hydrophobic those\nproteins are, or in some case aren't.\nThat's an entire landscape of  protein\nto water specific interactions, none of\nwhich we need to go into in any specific\ndetail now, but the one thing that we do\nneed to realize and keep in mind as we\ngo forward is that many of the biological\nprocesses in our body that involve the\nmovement to molecules such as water and\ninteractions with proteins, are going to\ninvolve the bonding or lack of bonding\nbetween water molecules and proteins.\nAnd anytime we're talking about bonding\nof one thing to the next at the level\nof chemistry or biology for that matter,\nbecause they're really the same thing.\nWe're talking about whether or not\nthere are electrons present or whether\nor not there are charges that are\nopposite or the same and on and on.\nIf you've ever heard of so-called\nreactive oxygen species, what are\nROS or reactive oxygen species or\nso-called free radicals or antioxidants?\nAll of that is really just\ndescribing the presence or absence\nof charges that are bound or unbound.\nSo for instance, if you hear about free\nradicals, sounds pretty wild, right?\nFree radicals.\nWhat are free radicals?\nFree radicals can damage cells.\nThey don't always damage cells, but\nthey can damage cells because they\nare essentially free electrons.\nThey are a charge that's sitting\nout there not bound to anything\nand therefore can interact with\nthe molecular structure of certain\nproteins and change those structures\nby binding to them or interfering with\nthe normal binding processes of those\nproteins to water or to other things.\nAnd in that way cause damage to those\nproteins and potentially damage to cells.\nNow fortunately, our cells have ways\nto deal with those free radicals,\nand those are called antioxidants.\nAntioxidants are molecules that\ncan arrive in different forms.\nSometimes we think of antioxidants as\nvitamins, but they are also present in\nother things as well that essentially\nbind up those free radicals or repair the\nbonds between cells so that the proteins\nare no longer undergoing these, let's\njust call them bad confirmations, that\ndamage the functioning of our cells.\nSo there are many different\ntheories of aging.\nThere are many different theories of\ndisease, but there is not a single\ndisease, either of brain or body that\ndoesn't in some way involve the generation\nof what are called reactive oxygen\nspecies, these free radicals and the\ndamaging of cells at the level of their\nindividual organelles and so forth.\nNor is there a single disease of brain or\nbody that has not been shown to benefit\nfrom having some antioxidant interference\nget in the way of that oxidative process.\nSo I realize today is pretty\nthick with nomenclature.\nFor those of you that haven't\nalready realized it, what you're\nlearning here is organic chemistry.\nSo you can feel pretty good about the\nfact that if you can understand the water\nmolecule and understand a little bit about\nwhat free electron is, which is basically\na charge that's out there that can\npotentially do damage and the interactions\nof things like reactive oxygen species\nand the ability of, of stable bonds to\nbuffer against  or repair certain damage\nto cells as we're describing it here.\nWell then what you're essentially\nthinking about and what we're\ntalking about is organic chemistry.\nNow, since this is a discussion about\nchemistry as a service to try and\nunderstand the biological effects of\nwater, keep in mind that water itself,\nbelieve it or not, can act as an\nantioxidant, provided that it's bonding to\nthings in the proper way, which requires\nthat it get into cells in the proper\namounts and rates, which requires that\nthe temperature and pH of that water be\ncorrect and provided that there's enough\nwater there and that that water isn't\nbound to other things, it's not containing\nsalutes that are damaging and potentially\nthat it's carrying some of the good things\nsuch as sodium or that there's potassium\npresent again, the so-called electrolytes\nthat allow cells to function well.\nOkay, so that's a bit of a trench of\ninformation, and I don't want people\nto get overwhelmed or confused.\nWhat I'm trying to do here is paint\na picture of the biology of water,\nunderstanding that when you ingest\nwater, drinking it down, or when you\nbreathe water vapors in the steam\nroom or on a humid day, that water is\nentering your system, it's accessing\nyour cells through these two mechanisms,\ndiffusion across cell membranes or\nmovement through aquaporin channels.\nAnd then once inside those cells,\nit's able to interact with and\nchange the confirmation of different\nproteins and accelerate or slow\ndown different cellular reactions.\nEverything from normal metabolism to\nblood pressure to damaged cells, depending\non a number of different features of\nthat water, as well as what the cells\nhappen to be doing at any given moment.\nSo with that in mind, I'd like to turn our\nattention to how water, depending on its\ntemperature, its pH, how much we drink,\nor how little we drink when we drink\nthat water, etc., how that can impact the\nhealth, disease and repair of different\ncells, tissues, and organs of our body.\nI'd like to just take a brief\nmoment and thank one of our podcast\nsponsors, which is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform.\nThey analyzes data from your blood and\nDNA to help you better understand your\nbody and help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that blood work is the only\nway that you can monitor the markers,\nsuch as hormone markers, lipids,\nmetabolic factors, etc., the impact\nyour immediate and long-term health.\nOne major challenge with blood work,\nhowever, is that most of the time it does\nnot come back with any information about\nwhat to do in order to move the values\nfor hormones, metabolic factors, lipids,\netc., into the ranges that you want.\nWith InsideTracker, changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized\ndashboard that you can use to address\nthe nutrition-based, behavior-based,\nsupplement based approaches that you\ncan use in order to move those values\ninto the ranges that are optimal for\nyou, your vitality and your longevity.\nInsideTracker now includes a\nmeasurement of Apolipoprotein B,\nso-called ApoB in their ultimate plan.\nApoB is a

each day,\nand how much fluid to drink depending on\nour specific activities and environment.\nNow, this is perhaps the most\ncommonly asked question when\nthe topic of water comes up, how\nmuch water do I need to drink?\nThe other thing that comes up is\na question, which is, can't we\njust follow our natural thirst?\nThat is, can't we just pay\nattention to when we're thirsty?\nAnd then drink fluids?\nAnd then that leads to the other\nquestion, which is, does the color of\nour urine provide any indication as to\nwhether or not we are under hydrated,\nover hydrated, or hydrating correctly?\nSo let me answer each of\nthese things one at a time.\nAnd in the backdrop, I want to highlight\nthe fact that there are many, many, if\nnot dozens, hundreds of studies pointing\nto the fact that when we are dehydrated,\nour brain doesn't function as well\nand our body doesn't function as well.\nSo what I'm attempting to do in that\nstatement is throw a net around the\nenormous number of studies that have\nshown that even a slight state of\ndehydration, even 2% dehydration, can\nlead to a significant and meaningful\nimpact, that is a negative impact\non our ability to, for instance,\ncarry out endurance type behaviors.\nSo our ability to run on a\ntreadmill and stop at the point\nwhere we feel we can't continue is\ngoing to be negatively impacted.\nThat is we will be able to perform\nless work for less period of time\nwhen we are even slightly dehydrated.\nLikewise, our strength is reduced\nby even slight dehydration.\nLikewise, our cognitive performance,\nincluding memory, focus, creative\nthinking, flexible thinking of different\nkinds, are all significantly impaired\nwhen we are in states of dehydration.\nNow, that raises an additional question\nthat deserves attention, which is how\ndo we actually measure dehydration?\nNow you hear different things like if you\npinch the skin on the top of your hand and\nit takes more than three seconds to lay\ndown again flat, then you're dehydrated.\nYou hear that, you hear, okay, if you\nare to press on your fingernail and see\na change in the color of the tissue,\njust be below your fingernail, which\nindeed does happen, and it does not go\nback to its original color within one to\nthree seconds, then you're dehydrated.\nYou hear things like this if your ankles\nare swollen when you're wearing socks,\nyou take off the socks and you can see\nthe imprint of the socks on your lower\nlimbs, that means you're dehydrated.\nYou hear this kind of stuff,\nand you should probably be\nwondering, is any of that true?\nTo some extent, it is true, although\nit can vary quite a bit by how\nold you are, whether or not  the\nskin on the top of your hand tends\nto be looser or not depending on\nwhether or not you're leaner or not.\nSo in other words, those\nare not absolutely objective\nmeasures of dehydration.\nNow, it is true that if normally you can\npinch the skin on the top of your hand\nand it returns to its normal flattened\nposition within about one to two or three\nseconds, and it does not do that within\nfive or more seconds, there's a decent\nprobability that you're a little bit\ndehydrated, that you need to ingest some\nfluid, or that if you press down on your\nnail and you see the depression causes a\ntransition from kind of a pink color to a\nwhite color, and then you release and it\ndoesn't go back to its original pinkish\ncolor within a few seconds, well then\nthere's a chance that you're dehydrated.\nBut again, these are not\nperfect measures of dehydration.\nYou may be surprised to learn, and I\nwas surprised to learn that most of\nthe basis for these statements, like\neven a 2% dehydration state, can lead\nto significant reductions in cognitive\nor physical performance are based on\nnot direct measures of hydration, but\nrather on measures of reductions in water\nintake, which is a different thing, right?\nIt's saying that ordinarily, a person\nof a given body weight needs X amount\nof fluid per day, and when they get even\njust 2% less than that amount of fluid\nthan their cognitive and or physical\nperformance is impaired, rather than\nfocusing on dehydration of tissues.\nOkay?\nNow that might seem like a\nsubtle distinction, but it's\nactually a meaningful distinction\nwhen you think about it.\nHowever, it's a meaningful\ndistinction that we can leverage\ntoward understanding how much water\nor fluid we need to drink each day.\nNow, there we can really point to some\nsolid numbers that, believe it or not,\nare fairly independent of body weight.\nNow, I say independent of body weight.\nI'm referring to the amount of fluid\nthat most healthy adults need at rest.\nWhat do I mean by at rest?\nI mean when not exercising and when\nnot in extremely hot environments.\nSo I'm leaving aside you a desert\nultra marathoners or people that are\ndoing any kind of movement or living in\nenvironments that are very, very hot.\nHere, I'm mainly referring to people that\nlive most of their daily life in indoor\nenvironments, could be air conditioned or\nnot air conditioned, heated or not heated.\nWhat we're trying to arrive at here are\nsome numbers that can work across the\nboard, because of course there are an\ninfinite number of different conditions\nthat each and all of you are existing in.\nSo I'm not going to attempt to give you a\nbody weight by activity, by environment,\nby humidity formula calculation.\nIn fact, no such calculation exists.\nHowever, there are formulas that can\nput you into very stable frameworks.\nThat is levels of water intake for\nperiods of rest when you're not exercising\nand for when you are exercising, that\nwill ensure that you are hydrating\nwith the one exception being if you\nare exercising or if you are living in\nvery, very hot conditions and you're\nnot heat adapted to those conditions.\nSo what are those numbers?\nIn other words, what is the\nanswer to the question of how\nmuch fluid do we need each day?\nAnd here I'm referring to fluid.\nI'm not distinguishing between\nwater, caffeinated beverages,\nsoda, tea, and so on.\nI'll discuss that in a moment.\nWe can reasonably say that for every hour\nthat you are awake in the first 10 hours\nof your day, this is important, in the\nfirst 10 hours of your day, you should\nconsume on average, 8 ounces of fluid.\nNow, for those of you that are using\nthe metric system, not ounces, 8\nounces of fluid is approximately\n236 milliliters of water.\nAnd for those of you that exist in\nthe metric system and aren't used to\nthinking about ounces and vice versa,\njust think about a typical can of soda.\nIn the United States, it's 12 ounces.\nIn Europe, sometimes the cans of\nsoda are a little bit smaller, but\nthat's a whole discussion unto itself.\nBut 8 ounces of fluid, that is 236,\nlet's just say 240 milliliters because\nwe don't need to be too precise here,\nof fluid on average every hour for\nthe first 10 hours of your day, which\ntranslates to an average of 80 ounces\nof fluid for the first 10 hours of your\nday, or 2,360 milliliters of water.\nIn other words, approximately 2\nliters of water plus a little bit more\nfor the first 10 hours of your day.\nNow, I wanna be very clear that\nthis does not mean that you need to\ningest 8 ounces or 236 milliliters\nof fluid on the hour, every hour\nfor the first 10 hours of your day.\nI'm certainly not saying that.\nAnd in fact, most people are\ngoing to find that they're\ngoing to ingest water in bolus.\nThat is, they're gonna have perhaps\n16 ounces of water, 500 milliliters\nof water at one portion of the day,\nand then maybe a couple hours of later\nthat they'll drink some more water or\nsome more coffee or soda or some other\nbeverage and another portion of the day.\nI do think, however, it's important for\nmost of us to take a step back and ask\nourselves whether or not independent\nof any other activity or environmental\nconditions, whether or not we are in\nfact ingesting 80 ounces or basically\n2.4 liters of water for that 10 hours\nof the day that spans from the time\nwe wake up until 10 hours later.\nNow, why am I setting\nthis 10 hour framework?\nThe reason I'm setting this 10 hour\nframework is that it turns out that\nyour fluid requirements, even just\nat rest, are vastly different in\nthe time from when you wake up until\nabout 10 hours later, as compared\nto the later evening and nighttime.\nAnd here I'm referring to people\nthat are not doing night shifts.\nBut if you are requesting a number of\nhow much fluid to drink independent\nof our needs for fluid for exercise,\nthat's going to be 8 ounces of fluid\nor 240 milliliters of fluid on average\nfor every hour from the time when\nwe wake up until 10 hours later.\nThat's the simple formulation that\nshould basically ensure that you're\ngetting sufficient baseline hydration\nfor the cells and tissues of your body.\nNow, if you are engaging in exercise,\nwhether or not it's endurance exercise or\nwhether or not it's resistance training\nexercise, you are going to need additional\nfluids in order to maximize the effects\nof that exercise and to avoid dehydration.\nAnd there too, we have some excellent\nnumbers that we can look to.\nExcellent, because they\narrive from research.\nAnd this is largely peeled from\nthe episode that I did with Dr.\nAndy Galpin, professor of\nKinesiology at Cal State Fullerton.\nWe did a six episode series all about\nexercise, everything from strength\ntraining, hypertrophy, endurance,\nnutrition, supplementation, recovery,\neverything related to exercise.\nYou can find all of\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nAnd one of the components of those\nepisodes that was discussed, but that\nsome of you may have not heard, is\nthat there is a simple formula for\nhow much fluid to ingest on average.\nKeep in mind, this is on average when\nyou are exercising, and I refer to\nthis as the so-called Galpin equation.\nThe Galpin equation states that\nyou should take your body weight in\npounds, divide that by 30, and that\nwill give you the number of ounces\nof fluid to ingest every 15 to 20\nminutes on average while exercising.\nOkay, your body weight impounds divided by\n30 equals the number of ounces of fluid to\nconsume on average every 15 to 20 minutes.\nWhen I say on average, what I mean\nis it is not the case that you\nneed to stop every 15 or 20 minutes\nand consume that volume of fluid.\nYou could sip it from moment to moment.\nYou could wait half an hour or\nan hour and then consume a larger\nbolus of fluid, a larger amount.\nAlthough it is recommended for\nperformance sake that you sip\nor consume beverages fairly\nconsistently throughout your training.\nOne's ability to do that is going\nto depend on a number of things like\ngastric emptying time, whether or\nnot the particular exercise you're\ndoing, whether or not it's running\nor jumping, is compatible with\ningesting fluid on a regular basis.\nOr whether or not you need to\ndo it at different intervals\nthan every 15, 20 minutes.\nMaybe it's every 5 minutes,\nmaybe it's every half hour.\nYou have to adjust for you.\nBut if you were to take the hour of\nexercise or the half hour of exercise\nor the 3 hours of exercise and ask how\nmuch fluid to ingest, it's going to be\nthat Galpin equation of body weight and\npounds to buy it by 30 equals the number\nof ounces for every 15 or 20 minutes.\nAnd of course, I can already\nhear screaming from the back.\nWhat about for those of us\nwho follow the metric system?\nAnd there there's a simple translation\nof the Galpin equation, which\nis that you need approximately 2\nmilliliters of water per kilogram of\nbody weight, every 15 to 20 minutes.\nAgain, the Galpin equation converted\ninto the metric system is going to be 2\nmilliliters of water per kilogram of body\nweight every 15 to 20 minutes on average.\nI'm sure a number of you are asking\nwhether or not hydration prior\nto exercise is also important.\nIt absolutely is, and if you follow\nthe numbers that I talked about before,\napproximately 8 ounces or 240 milliliters\nof fluid intake per hour in the first 10\nhours of waking, that should establish a\ngood baseline of hydration heading into\nexercise, which then prompts the next\nquestion I often get, which is, is the\namount of water that needs to be consumed\naccording to the Galpin equation during\nexercise on top of, or separate from that?\nThat is, does it replace the amount of\nfluid that one needs at a basic level,\nthat 8 ounces or 240 milliliters?\nAnd there the answer\nsort of goes both ways.\nI think if you're going to\nexercise, then obviously follow\nthe Galpin equation in some way.\nAgain, you don't need to be\nultra specific about this.\nThese are ballpark figures that will\nensure hydration, so we've set them a\nlittle bit higher perhaps than needed to\nensure more hydration rather than less.\nBut basically the short answer is if\nyou're exercising for about an hour,\nmost people are exercising for an hour\nor two, probably not more than that.\nMost of my workouts are\ncertainly the resistant training\nworkouts last about an hour.\nWell, then you can replace the 8\nounces or the 240 milliliters of water\nthat's required at baseline with what\nyou consume according to the Galpin\nequation during that bout of exercise.\nA common question is if you are exercising\nin a heated environment, indoor, outdoor,\nor you are somebody who tends to sweat\na lot, and by the way, we can all get\nbetter at sweating, by sweating more.\nSweat is an adaptation.\nSo if you sit in the sauna more,\nyou're gonna get better at sweating.\nIf you exercise more, especially if\nyou wear more layers, or if you do\nit in hotter temperatures or more\nhumid temperatures, you're gonna\nget better at sweating over time.\nAnd sweating is an adaptation\nthat helps cool your body.\nIf you are sweating a lot or you're in\nheat, how much fluid should you ingest?\nIn general, I think it's safe to say that\nyou may want to increase the values on\nthe Galpin equation by about 50 to a 100%.\nSo either increase by 50% or double\nthose numbers if you're in a very hot\nenvironment or sweating an awful lot.\nIf you are sitting in the sauna, I highly\nrecommend consuming at least 8 ounces and\nprobably more like 16 ounces of fluid.\nSo that translates again to about 240\nor about 480, let's just round up 500\nmilliliters of fluid for every 20 to\n30 minutes that you are in a hot sauna.\nAnd then of course,\npeople ask, well, how hot?\nAnd it, okay, that starts getting\nreally detailed and we can't distinguish\nbetween dry saunas and wet saunas.\nAnd again, too many variables.\nBut I would double your fluid intake\nfor that hot environment exercise or\nfor that hot environment sauna sit.\nAlso if you are feeling dehydrated,\nokay, what does feeling dehydrated mean?\nThat actually has a definition that\nwe can get into a little bit later.\nBut what we're really talking about here\nis if you are feeling as if your throat\nis dry, you are \"parched\", or you're very\nthirsty, well then there's absolutely\nno problem with ingesting more fluids.\nSo 16 ounces of fluid or 500\nmilliliters of fluid per hour\nwhile you're feeling parched.\nMy read of the literature is that\nthirst is a reasonable guide for\nwhen we tend to be dehydrated.\nHowever, it is the case that our\nthirst doesn't really keep up with\nour body's level of dehydration.\nAnd we know that based on some really\nnice studies that have explored the\namount of fluid intake compared to the\namount of urination, compared to the\namount of physical output compared to the\nenvironment that one happens to be in.\nAnd these are sort of older\nstudies in the realm of physiology.\nBut here's the basic rule of thumb\nthat's gonna work for most people.\nIf you are feeling parched, consume\nfluids, ideally you consume fluids that\ndon't contain caffeine or other diuretics.\nDiuretics being substances that cause\nthe release, the urination of fluid from\nthe body and or if you are consuming\ncaffeine either prior to or after bouts\nof exercise or even just at work or you\nwork in a air conditioned or otherwise\ndry, cool or hot environment, that\nyou try and include some sodium and\nideally sodium, potassium, magnesium,\nthe electrolytes in that beverage.\nSo it could be a little pinch\nof sea salt with some lemon to\nadjust the taste a little bit.\nIt could be an electrolyte drink,\nan LMNT or some other sort, they're\na lot of different types out there.\nFor most people drinking pure water,\nand I realize that many people do\njust like the taste of pure water.\nChances are you're going to have enough\nelectrolytes unless you're sweating\nquite a bit or you're exercising quite\na lot, and under conditions where you\nare consuming very few carbohydrates,\nyou're going to excrete more fluid.\nIf you are ingesting caffeine, whether\nor not it's from tea or coffee, I\nhighly recommend increasing your non\ncaffeine fluid intake about two to\none for every volume of caffeine.\nSo in other words, if you have a 6 ounces\nor 8 ounces of coffee, you're gonna want\n12 to 16 ounces of fluid, ideally fluid\nwith electrolytes, or a little pinch of\nsalt in order to offset that dehydration.\nSo hopefully those will provide good\nrules of thumb for what people want to do\nwhen they're just moving about their day.\nAgain, underscored by the fact that\neven slight levels of dehydration can\nreally impair our cognitive and physical\nperformance largely by creating fatigue.\nBut more often than not\nby creating brain fog.\nYou know, I get so many\nquestions about brain fog.\nWhy do I have brain fog?\nWhy do I have brain fog?\nThere is a vast literature showing\nthat quality hydration, meaning\nhydration that matches the demands\nof humidity and output as described\nin the equations that we went over a\nlittle bit before, really can enhance\nclarity of focus and overall energy.\nAnd we'll talk about why that is, but\nI'll just allude to it a little bit here.\nThe reason why ingesting sufficient\nfluids can enhance our ability to\nfocus, and in fact can reduce brain\nfog and can increase physical vigor\nand output is not mysterious to us.\nWe know that there are two mechanisms\nby which fluid intake triggers\nelevated levels of alertness, and\nit all has to do with the so-called\nsympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous\nsystem, which is a real mouthful.\nBut basically the sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system, as\nmany of you've heard me talk about\nbefore, is the aspect of your nervous\nsystem that makes you more alert.\nHas nothing to do with emotional sympathy,\nhas to do with a bunch of neurons in\nthe middle of your spinal cord called\nthe sympathetic chain ganglia, and\nsome other related neural networks\nin your body, as well as regions of\nyour brain, like the locus coeruleus,\nthat release things like epinephrine\nand norepinephrine and make you more\nalert and in a kind of magnificent\narrangement,  or I think magnificent\narrangement, when we have fluid in our\ngut and when our cells are well hydrated,\nand believe it or not, when our bladder\ncontains fluid within it, there is an\nelevation in activity of the sympathetic\nnervous system by way of two pathways.\nOne is mechanical.\nIn fact, we have so-called stretch\nreceptors in our bladder and in our\ngut, these stretch receptors have\nfancy names like TRP trip channels\nas they're called, or piezo, which\nare these stretch sensing channels.\nThis is the beautiful work of many\nlaboratories, but in particular\nDavid Julius and Ardem Patapoutian.\nDavid Julius is at UC San Francisco,\nArdem is at the Scripps Institute.\nThey've discovered a bunch of\nchannels in cells that sends things\nfrom cold to different mechanical\npressure, including expansion of\ntissues so-called Mechanosensation.\nAnd basically what it all boils down\nto is that when our bladder has some\nfluid in it, when our stomach has\nsome fluid in it, and when our cells\nare sufficiently hydrated, they send\ninformation about the mechanical\npresence of that distension even.\nAnd then here, I'm not talking\nabout being like overly full or, you\nknow, full of chock-a-block, full\nof fluid or your bladder feeling,\nyou know, really, really full.\nWe'll talk about that in a moment.\nBut when we are sufficiently hydrated,\nthere's a mechanical signature of\nthat, which is the expansion of our\ntissues because it has more fluid in it.\nAnd there are chemical signals as\nwell, which is the movement of water\nacross those aquaporin channels is\nactually understood at a biological\nlevel by ourselves and sends information\nto the areas of the brain that are\nassociated with so-called sympathetic\narousal and makes us more alert.\nThis is actually what wakes us\nup in the middle of the night.\nIf we have consumed too much\nfluid prior to sleep and we\nneed to urinate, we wake up.\nThis is a mechanism that is not adequately\ndeveloped in babies and young children.\nThis is why babies, young\nchildren often will wet their bed.\nAnd believe it or not, in both\nhumans and in dogs, our ability to\ncontrol urination voluntarily is\nsomething that we actually learn.\nBabies just pee in their diaper.\nDogs just pee on the floor until\ntheir house broken or until a child\nlearns to hold onto their urine,\nuntil they go to the bathroom, in the\nbathroom, or particularly appropriate\nlocation outdoors or otherwise.\nThe point is that hydration of the body\nis signaled to the brain when we have\nenough fluid in the tissues of our body,\nwhen we've consumed enough fluid, even\nif it hasn't already arrived to the cells\nand tissues of our body, that is signaled\nto the brain in the form of alertness.\nAnd that alertness is what translates\nto the enhanced cognitive abilities\nthat we have when we are well hydrated.\nIt's also what translates to our\nenhanced physical abilities when we\nare challenged with physical tasks.\nSo when you look out on the landscape\nof all these studies that have\nshown impairments in physical or\ncognitive performance under conditions\nof even slight dehydration, that\nall makes sense because our cells\nneed fluid and we need water.\nBut it also prompts the question\nof, well, does being well hydrated\nactually make our brain and body\nfunction better in the context of\nphysical and cognitive performance?\nAnd indeed, the answer is yes.\nNow, earlier we were talking about\nthese equations that you can apply.\nAnd here again, I really want to emphasize\nthat these equations were not meant to\nbe followed down to the decimal point.\nThey were really meant and are meant\nas crude, but sufficient guides for\nyou to make sure that you're getting\nenough hydration depending on your\nlevels of activity and at rest.\nIf you recall when we talked about\nthose equations, I said, you need\nabout 8 ounces or 240 milliliters\nof fluid per hour for the first\n10 hours of your day after waking.\nNow, why did I say for the first 10 hours?\nWell, it turns out that the filtration\nof fluids from your body, which is\naccomplished of course, by your kidneys\nand by way of your bladder, and the\nexcretion of fluid out urethra, so-called\nurination, is strongly, strongly\ncircadian dependent, meaning the cells\nof your kidney and the cells even of\nyour gut, in fact, all the cells of\nyour body, but especially the cells\nof your kidney, which filter the fluid\nthat comes into your body, and that\nmakes certain hormones like vasopressin,\nwhich is antidiuretic hormone.\nAll of that functioning of the kidney\nis under strong regulation by so-called\ncircadian clock genes, circadian clock\ngenes are genes that are expressed\nin every cell, but that in certain\ncells of the body very strongly\nimpact whether or not that organ, in\nthis case, the kidney is going to be\nactivated, meaning functioning at a\nvery high level or at a reduced level.\nAnd we can make all of this very simple\nby simply stating what's contained in\nthis beautiful review that I'll provide\na link to if you want to learn more\ncalled circadian rhythms in the kidney.\nAnd basically what is known is that\nfor the first 10 hours after waking,\nyour kidney is filtering fluid within\nyour body at a very rapid rate.\nThere are a number of different cell\ntypes that do that, but they are\nbasically taking that fluid, pulling\nout any contaminants using hormones such\nas antidiuretic hormone, vasopressin\nto adjust whether or not you're gonna\nhold onto fluid or release more fluid\nfrom your body in the form of urine.\nDepending on the salt concentration,\ndepending on how much fluid\nyou need, your work output, the\nconditions you're in, all of that.\nHowever, at about 10 hours after waking\nyour kidney really starts to reduce\nits overall level of functioning.\nNow that doesn't mean that your kidney\ncannot filter fluid 11 or 12 or 16\nhours after waking, but it becomes far\nless efficient at doing so, and thank\ngoodness it does because you do not\nwant your kidney filtering fluid at\nthe same rate at midnight, assuming you\nwake up at say, 7 or 8 or 9:00 AM that\nit was filtering fluid at 10:00 AM.\nIn fact, we can say that if you want\nto reduce your nighttime waking in\norder to urinate, which is a common,\ncommon question and concern that many\npeople have, how can I avoid waking up\nin the middle of the night to urinate?\nAnd there I say it's perfectly normal\nto wake up once, maybe twice each night\nto urinate, but if you want to reduce\nthe number of times that you wake up\nin order to urinate across the night,\nmaybe even make that number zero times.\nYou will greatly benefit\nby doing 3 things.\nFirst of all, make sure that you're\nhydrating sufficiently during the daytime\nper the equations that we talked about\nearlier, that will ensure that you are\nnot excessively thirsty in the evening\nand therefore consuming a lot more fluid.\nSecond, and related to that first point\nis that you do want to reduce your\nfluid intake at night, provided you\nhydrated sufficiently throughout the day.\nAnd believe it or not, the rate at\nwhich fluid moves from your gut and\ninto the cells and tissues of your body\nand then from your bladder into urine\nis determined not just by the volume\nof fluid you ingest, but also the rate\nat which you ingest that fluid and\nyou might be thinking, that's crazy.\nThat makes no sense at all, right?\nIf I drink a ton of fluid\nslowly, doesn't it still mean\nthat I'm going to urinate a ton?\nYes and no.\nIt also stands to reason that you\nmight ask, if I ingest very little\nfluid, but I do it very fast,\nis it gonna be the case that I'm\ngonna urinate it out very quickly?\nWell, yes and no.\nThe point is that the fluid filtration\nsystems of your body that range from\nthe gut to the bladder and include the\nkidney, of course, depend not just on the\nvolume, but on the rate of fluid that you\ningest because of those Mechanosensors\nthat we talked about earlier.\nIf you gulp down a bunch of fluids,\nyou are going to excrete those fluids\nmore quickly than if you sip them\nslowly, excuse me, sip them slowly.\nSo here's what I recommend\nthroughout the day.\nWhen you're trying to get your adequate\nyield of water or other beverages,\nfeel free to gulp that fluid or sip it.\nI'm a gulper, not a sipper, but\nmany of you are gonna be sippers,\nnot gulpers, consume fluid at the\nrate that feels right to you, but\nfeel comfortable gulping that fluid.\nHowever, in the evening, if you are\nsomebody who has challenges with\nwaking up excessively in the middle\nof the night, reduce your fluid intake\nprovided you hydrate properly throughout\nthe day, and I suggest consuming no\nmore than 5, maybe 8 ounces of fluid\nbetween the time of 10 hours after\nwaking and when you go to sleep.\nAgain, if you're very thirsty or you\nunder hydrate or it's very hot, feel\nfree to ingest more fluid please.\nBut most people will find that if they\nreduce their fluid intake to about 5\nounces or less of fluid in that later\npart of the day, after 10 hours of having\nwoken up and before sleep, and they sip\nthose beverages as opposed to gulping\nthem, that they will have fewer bouts\nof waking up in the middle of the night\nto go to the restroom and ideally zero.\nLet's talk about tap water, and here\nI have to take a deep breath, not a\ndeep gulp, but a deep breath because in\nresearching tap water and what's contained\nin tap water in different regions, not\njust in the US but around the world, I\nconfess the picture is a pretty scary one.\nI want to be clear, I'm not somebody\nwho naturally orients towards\nfear or conspiracy theories.\nHowever, in researching tap water for\nthis episode by way of looking at the\npeer reviewed research, meta-analysis\nreviews, specific research articles where\nspecific hypotheses were tested, and in\ntalking with experts in toxicology and so\non, it's a pretty grim picture frankly.\nWhen one looks at what's contained in\nmost tap water and whether or not the\ncompounds that are contained in tap water\nare present in sufficient concentrations\nto negatively impact our health.\nAnd the bad news is that much, if not\nall, tap water, believe it or not much if\nnot all, tap water contains things that\nare bad for the biology of our cells.\nThere is a silver lining, however, and\nthe silver lining is that very simple\nsteps that are very inexpensive can\nbe used to adjust that tap water to\nmake it not just safe to drink, but\nthat makes it perfectly fine to drink.\nSo that's the good news, and\nwe'll get to that in a moment.\nIf you are somebody who is interested\nin whether or not tap water contains\nthings like endocrine disruptors, hormone\ndisruptors that can negatively impact\nreproductive health in males or females,\nor both, there is a wonderful review,\nwonderful, because it's so thorough.\nAlthough the news isn't great, it's\nvery thorough, which is great, which is\nentitled Endocrine Disruptors in Water and\nTheir Effects on the Reproductive System.\nThis is a review from 2020 that analyzes\nwater from a bunch of different sources\nwithin the world and essentially\nfocuses on a few key components.\nFirst of all, it focuses on\nthe concentration of minerals.\nThat is magnesium and\ncalcium within water.\nMany people don't realize\nthis, but so-called hard\nwater sounds terrible, right?\nBut hard water is water that\ncontains magnesium and calcium,\nwhich turns out to be a good thing.\nSome water contains more\nmagnesium and calcium.\nOther water contains less.\nThey looked at the presence of\nmagnesium and calcium because that\nis going to impact the pH of water.\nIn general, the higher concentrations\nof magnesium and calcium and water, the\nhigher the pH that is, the more alkaline\nthat water is, and the lower levels of\nmagnesium and calcium, the more acidic\nor lower pH that water tends to be.\nThe other thing that this review addresses\nis the concentration of so-called\nDBPs: dog bulldog, porcupines, DBPs.\nWhich are disinfection\nbyproducts contained in water.\nSo obviously local governments,\nthe government wants your\ndrinking water to be clean.\nThey don't want contaminants in,\nthey don't want sewage in that water.\nThey don't want chemical contaminants\nthat are going to make people\nimmediately sick, so they treat water.\nWater treatment plants, treat water\nwith disinfection products, and those\ndisinfection products create things\ncalled disinfection byproducts.\nAnd the presence of those DBPs\nor disinfectant byproducts can\nstrongly impact the pH of water by\nway of changing the concentrations\nof magnesium and calcium.\nPut differently, I do believe that\ngovernments are trying to provide\npeople with clean water, but in doing\nso, oftentimes we'll introduce things\nto that water that are not good for us.\nNow, it's very clear that DBPs can\ncause endocrine disruption in ways that\nare not good for reproductive health.\nI did a very long, in fact, 4 and a half\nhour episode on fertility and vitality.\nThat was male and female\nfertility, by the way.\nAnd vitality that again, you can find\nat hubermanlab.com that talks about\nall the biological processes involved\nin the generation of healthy eggs and\nsperm and, and creating healthy embryos,\nimplantation embryos, and so forth.\nIt's very clear that DBPs have been\nshown to disrupt ovarian function,\nspermatogenesis and fertility outcomes.\nEven at concentrations of DBPs\nthat are present in drinking\nwater that comes from the tap.\nNow, does that mean that you\nshouldn't drink tap water?\nWell, the answer to that is it depends.\nWhat does it depend on?\nWell, it depends on several things.\nFirst of all, I highly recommend\nto everybody go online and put\nin your zip code and ask for a\nwater analysis of water that comes\nout of the tap in that zip code.\nThis is something that is readily\navailable online, at least to my\nknowledge, and unfortunately, there's no\nspecific one site that I can send everyone\nto, to get an in-depth analysis of the\ndrinking water that comes out of your tap.\nHowever, I highly recommend that you\ngo online and put in your zip code\nor municipal area code and figure out\nwhether or not your water contains X\namount of DBPs or Y amount of DBPs.\nNow, of course, you're gonna get a\nbunch of values back, and unless you're\na toxicologist, You are probably not\ngonna know what those values mean.\nBut what you're really looking\nfor is whether or not there are\nhigh, low, or moderate levels of\nfluoride in that drinking water.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, there are studies that show that\nthe concentration of fluoride in drinking\nwater is of particular concern for the\nthyroid hormone system of the body.\nNow, thyroid hormone has a lot\nof different roles in brain and\nbody, and thyroid hormone is very\nimportant for everything from\nmetabolism to levels of energy.\nWhen thyroid levels are disrupted\nor thyroid receptors are disrupted,\nit can lead to depression.\nWhen thyroid hormones are\noptimized, it can lead to optimal\nmood if there is such a thing.\nBut in other words, it helps\nkeep your mood elevated.\nIt relates to everything from sleep to\nreproduction, thyroid hormones involved\nin many, many things including bone\nhealth and tissue health generally.\nSo essentially, every biological\nprocess in your body is impacted by\nthyroid hormone, and there's a study\nthat I'd like to highlight, which was\npublished in 2018, and the title of\nthe study is Impact of Drinking Water\nFluoride on Human Thyroid Hormones.\nThis was a case control study\nso this is not an extensive\nanalysis of many individuals.\nHowever, what it shows is that fluoride\nnegatively impacts thyroid stimulating\nhormone and so-called T3 levels.\nSo you have thyroid hormone, T3, and T4\neven in the standard concentrations that\nare present of, and here's an important\nnumber, 0.5 milligrams per liter.\nOkay?\nSo if you can get ahold of the fluoride\nconcentrations in your tap water and find\nout whether or not the concentrations\nare at below or exceed 0.5 milligrams\nper liter, what you'll find is that\neven just 0.5 milligrams per liter of\nwater can disrupt thyroid function.\nAnd this is going to be a particular\nconcern for people to have familial,\nso genetically related thyroid\nissues, or that are concerned with\nkeeping your thyroid hormone levels\nhealthy, which I think is everybody.\nSo I am telling you that you should\ntry and get ahold of some data about\nthe water that comes out of your tap\nif you intend on drinking tap water.\nAnd probably even if you don't\njust know what's in your drinking\nwater, your local government should\nprovide that information and or it\nshould be readily available online.\nAnd in particular, I think it's\nworthwhile to address how much fluoride\nis present in your drinking water.\nAgain, I don't want to\ncreate a lot of scare.\nI'm not trying to trigger fear here.\nI do think, however, by way of reading\nthis review by way of reading the paper\nthat I just referred to a moment ago,\nagain, links to these are going to be\nprovided in the show note captions,\nthat there is extensive evidence that\nelevated levels of fluoride in drinking\nwater are simply not good for us.\nNow, that could open a whole discussion\nof why fluoride is in our drinking\nwater in the first place at all.\nBut leaving that aside, it seems to me\nthat most everybody should know how much\nfluoride is in their drinking water.\nAnd ideally, everybody, yes, everybody\nis filtering their drinking water.\nNow, that raises the question of\nhow best to filter drinking water.\nAnd that brings an answer of it\ndepends on a couple of things.\nFirst of all, how healthy or\nunhealthy do you know yourself to be?\nOkay?\nSo if you're somebody who has no health\nissues, you have plenty of vigor, you're\nsleeping well at night, you have no\nautoimmune disease, you're not aware\nof any health concern, minor or major,\nwell then perhaps you're somebody that\ndoesn't want to filter your water.\nI would argue that why wouldn't you\nemploy some very low or even zero\ncost approach to filtering your water?\nThere are going to be other individuals\nwho are suffering particular ailments of\nbrain or body, or both, that absolutely\nshould be filtering their drinking water,\nif they're getting their drinking the\nwater from their tap because it is pretty\nwell established now that tap water\ncontains a lot of these disinfectant\nbyproducts, as well as in most cases,\nexceeding the threshold of fluoride\nthat we know to be healthy for us.\nHow should you filter your tap water?\nWell, you have everything ranging\nfrom the so-called Brita type filters.\nSo these are gonna be carbon type filters\nor other filters that you essentially\nput over a container or a compartment\nwhere you can pour the water over it\nand goes into the compartment below.\nWill those work?\nAre they sufficient to filter\nout the disinfectant byproducts?\nThe general answer is yes, provided\nyou change the filters often enough.\nHowever, it is not thought,\nunfortunately, not thought that\nthey filter out sufficient fluoride.\nSo what I highly recommend is depending\non your budget, that you go online\nand you search for at-home water\nfilters that can filter out fluoride.\nThere are a number of straightforward\nand inexpensive tools to do that.\nAnd here I don't have any relationship\nto any of the water filters or\nthings that I'm gonna mention.\nNow, I wanna be very clear about that\nthere's no brand code or affiliation here.\nI'm simply trying to direct you to\nresources that will allow you to filter\nyour tap water for it to be more safe for\nyou to consume in a way that meets your\nbudget with the understanding that people\nhave very different disposable incomes.\nSo the range of costs here is\ngoing to be pretty tremendous.\nI just wanna get that outta the way first.\n, you know, there are water filters\nthat you can use repeatedly.\nSo these are what I'll refer\nto as pitch filters that are\nless than a hundred dollars.\nNow keep in mind that that's a one-time\npurchase except for the replacement\nof the filters, which fortunately\ndoesn't have to be done too often.\nSo there are different filters.\nI'll provide a link to one that\nI found that is at least by my\nread of the lowest possible cost.\nSo this is the so-called clearly filtered\nwater pitcher with affinity filtration.\nSo this is a filter that can\nadequately remove fluoride, lead,\nBPAs, glyphosates, hormones, and\nsome of the other harmful things\nthat are contained in most tap water.\nAgain, I do realize that for\nsome people, even an 80 US dollar\ncost is going to be prohibitive.\nBut do realize that what you're doing\nhere is you're purchasing a unit that\ncan be used repeatedly, over and over.\nThe reason why it's lower cost than\nsome of the different filtration\napproaches that I'll talk about in\na moment are that you can't really\nput all the drinking water that you\nwould use, say for an entire week or\nfor an entire month in one pitcher.\nYou're gonna have to repeatedly pour water\ninto the pitcher in order to filter it.\nNow, as I mentioned before, the range\non water filter costs for filters that\ncan adequately remove fluoride and\nall the other things that you want\nout of your top water is immense.\nIn fact, you can find you know,\nwhole house water filters that\nare, you know, $2,000 or more.\nAgain, these are gonna be filters that\nare gonna be in your garage or in a, a\nlaundry room that are going to basically\npull from the, the piping system of\nyour house and deliver purified water.\nI technically, it's not purified, but\nthat's removing these contaminants  and\nfluoride from all the sinks in your house.\nSo you could effectively drink from\nany or all sinks in your house.\nThat's what explains the higher cost.\nI think most people are probably not\ngoing to have the disposable income\nor have the opportunity to include one\nof these whole house filters, although\nif you do have the means and it's\nimportant to you, you could do that.\nAnd then there are going to be what\nI would call intermediate systems.\nSo systems that cost somewhere\nbetween 200 and $500.\nProbably one of the more common\nones or popular ones is a\nso-called Berkey filter system.\nThese are filter systems that, again,\nremove the things that you want\nremoved from your tap water, and\nthey can do it at higher volumes.\nAnd they're typically countertop units.\nThey don't require any plugin typically,\nor they only require brief plugin\nand electricity, and they're going to\nfilter out many, many liters or tens of\nliters of water so that you can always\nhave access to that clean filtered\nwater time or day or night without\nhaving to pour over into the pitcher.\nSo I mentioned these different options\nbecause again, I realize that people have\ndifferent levels of disposable income.\nAs far as I know, there's no tablet or\nsimple mechanism that can be purchased\nas a transportable, you know pill\nthat you can just simply throw in\nwater and remove the contaminants.\nIf anyone is aware of one that\ncan adequately remove fluoride and\nother contaminants, please put in\nthe comment section on YouTube.\nThat'd be the best place.\nSo that I and everyone else can see\nit, but hopefully the mention of the\ndifferent filtration systems that I\nmentioned  we'll give you some choices\nthat I would hope would fall within the\nrange that one could potentially afford.\nAn important note about filtration.\nJust as in our body, there are mechanisms\nto signal mechanical changes and\nchemical changes that occur in our\ngut, in our brain, etc., elsewhere\nand in general, both mechanical and\nchemical changes are signaled across\nthe body to invoke different changes,\nwhether or not those are, you know,\na response of the immune system or to\nmake us more alert or more asleep, etc.\nSo too filtration capitalizes on\nmechanical and chemical filtration.\nWhat I mean by that is when you\nrun a fluid water or any other\nfluid through a filter, those\nfilters are doing two things.\nThey are physically constraining which\nmolecules can go through by creating\nportals, pores that allow certain size\nmolecules to go through and not others.\nAnd almost always, they contain\ncertain chemicals themselves, right?\nThose filters have been treated\nwith certain chemicals that\nneutralize certain other chemicals.\nOkay?\nSo you may be wondering how\nwhen you filter water, you know,\nmagnesium and calcium could get\nthrough, but fluoride doesn't.\nAnd that's because these filters\nhave been very cleverly designed\nin order to neutralize fluoride or\nto prevent large molecules, such as\nsediment and dirt, which is kind of\neasy to imagine being filtered, but\nalso to allow certain small molecule,\nlike calcium, which is small-ish, or\nmagnesium, which is small-ish to still\npass through into our drinking water.\nAnd this is wonderful because what\nit means is that by filtering our\nwater, using any of the methods that\nwe talked about before, you're still\ngoing to get whatever magnesium and\ncalcium was present in that water while\nstill adequately removing the fluoride\nand other disinfectant byproducts.\nNow, what if you can't\nafford any of those options?\nOkay, well here you have an\ninteresting zero cost option.\nIt's not as good as the other ones\nof filtering that water, but it is an\noption, and I do think it's important\nto give options to people who don't have\nany disposable income for the purpose\nof filtering their water, which is to\ndraw a gallon or 5 gallons or maybe even\nmore, tap water out of the tap and put it\ninto some, some container, some vessel.\nSo it could be one gallon, 5\ngallon, 10 gallon container.\nAnd then to let that tap water sit for\nsome period of time to allow some of\nthe sediment to drop to the bottom.\nNow you might say, well, there's no\nsediment, there's nothing contained\nin that tap water and it isn't\nfluoride diluted in the water.\nAnd indeed the answer to that is yes.\nHowever, there is some evidence that\nletting tap water sit out at room\ntemperature and outside the pipes that\ndeliver that water can help remove some,\nnot all of the contaminants in that water.\nIf, however you are filtering the\nwater using any of the methods\nthat I talked about a few moments\nago, you do not need to do this.\nOkay?\nI realize there's a whole world out there\nof people who insist on putting their\nwater in the sun or only keeping it in\ncertain containers and putting it out\nfor a few days before they get ingested.\nThat to me, seems a bit extreme.\nIf you wanna do that, be my guest, but I\ndon't think most people need to do that.\nHowever, I do believe that for people who\nhave zero disposable income to devote to\npaying for any kind of filtration system\nfor their tap water, they're taking that\ntap water and putting into some container\nat room temperature and keeping it room\ntemperature for a half day or a day\nor more, and then pouring off the top\ntwo thirds of that water into another\ncontainer and consuming the water from\nthat second container is going to remove\nsome, not all of the contaminants that\none would need to be concerned about.\nAnd here I should mention something that\nI neglected to mention a few moments ago.\nIf you were going to do this\nzero cost option and, and let the\nwater sit out for a bit, you would\nwant that water to sit uncapped.\nSorry, I should have\nmentioned that before.\nUncapped, of course, trying to keep\nthings from falling into that water.\nIn fact, you could even put a a little\nbit of cloth above it, so you don't\nwant things falling into that water,\nbut you want certain things to be able\nto evaporate off, and you also want\nsome of the sediment to drop down.\nAnd the reason why this process of letting\nwater sit out would work at all is because\nmany of the contaminants contained within\nwater are not present because of the\nsource of that water or even the treatment\nof that water, but rather because of the\npipes that that water arrives to your\nglass or your, the pot that you have from.\nOkay?\nAnd here again, there is an\ninfinite number of variables.\nSo some people are living in\nbuildings for which the pipes are\nvery, very old, but very, very clean.\nBelieve it or not, some people are\nliving in newer buildings and structures.\nThey have new pipes, but for which the\nseals between those pipes contain things\nthat are not good for you to consume.\nSo by letting water sit out for a while,\nyou are able to remove some of the\ncontaminants present within the pipes of\nyour home and the building and even the\npipes that lead to your home or apartment.\nNow, some people get really obsessed\nwith this old tap water thing and really\nwanna find out all the details about the\npipes and what sorts of, you know, hard\nmetals and how much magnesium and how\nmuch calcium are present in their water.\nThere are ways that you can test your\ndrinking water for those sorts of things.\nMost people, I realize, including\nmyself, are simply not going to do that.\nIf you want to know what I do, I tend\nto drink water that is filtered through\none of these lower cost filters.\nOr if I'm going to be consuming a lot\nof fluid, I will drink certain kinds\nof fluid that later I'll tell you, I've\nbeen doing an experiment for sake of this\nepisode looking at so-called molecular\nhydrogen water, which sounds very fancy\nand esoteric and almost a little wacky.\nBut it turns out has largely to do\nwith the amount of magnesium and\ncalcium and the pH of that water.\nSo if you are somebody who has a very\nlow budget or simply just wants to\nspend a very small amount of money and\ntry and still drink tap water, there\nis absolutely a way to do that safely.\nBut it does require a few of these steps.\nSo, on the topic of magnesium and\ncalcium, this relates, as I mentioned\nearlier, to the \"hardness\" of water.\nSo what of the hardness of water, you\nknow, is it better to have more magnesium\nand calcium in your water or less?\nSome people don't like\nthe taste of hard water.\nThey prefer the taste of water\nthat has less magnesium in calcium.\nHowever, there I would encourage\nyou to take a step back and\nconsider some of the literature.\nIn fact I'll mention a paper in particular\nnow, published in 2019, which describes\nthe quote, regulations for calcium,\nmagnesium, or hardness in drinking water\nin the European Union member states.\nTurns out in Europe, they do very\ndetailed  water analysis and that's\npresent in a number of really high\nquality scientific publications.\nThis was a paper published in regulatory\ntoxicology and pharmacology, and they\ncite a number of different references\nin the introduction that, for instance,\nin here I'm quoting statistically\nsignificant inverse association between\nmagnesium and cardiovascular mortality.\nNow, again, that's a, an association,\nthis is not causal, but higher magnesium\nin water, lower cardiovascular mortality.\nThey go on to say the highest exposure\ncategory, which are people consuming\ndrinking water with magnesium contents\nof 8.3 to 19.4 milligrams per liter.\nAgain, when you get your water analysis,\nyou can compare against some of these\nvalues was significantly associated with\ndecreased likelihood of cardiovascular\nmortality by 25% compared with\npeople consuming magnesium content\nof 2.5 to 8.2 milligrams per liter.\nOkay, so what this basically shows,\nand, and by the way, the reference\nto that I'll also provide a link\nto, in the show note caption.\nWhat this basically states is that\nhigher magnesium containing water,\nand it turns out higher magnesium and\ncalcium  containing water, so-called\nharder water may not taste as good to\nyou, but turns out to be better for you.\nNow, whether or not it can prevent\nyou from getting cardiovascular\ndisease, I don't know.\nIn fact, I would probably just\nstate no, it probably won't prevent\nyou from cardiovascular disease.\nYou still need to do all the other\nthings that are important for\navoiding cardiovascular disease\nand cerebral vascular disease.\nFor that and what to do in order\nto avoid cardiovascular disease.\nI strongly encourage you to\nlisten to the episode with Dr.\nPeter Attia, that's coming out in a\nfew weeks that gets deep into that\ntopic and the actionable items for\navoiding cardiovascular disease.\nBut basically, as this study quotes,\nthere is a growing consensus among\nepidemiologists and epidemiological\nevidence along with clinical and\nnutritional evidence that's strong\nenough to suggest that new guidance\nshould be issued in terms of how these\ndifferent sources of tap water should\nenhance, not deplete the amount of\nmagnesium and calcium in that water.\nNow, this ought to raise a very\nimportant question in all of your\nminds, which is why is it that\nmagnesium and calcium concentrations\nare relevant to cardiovascular disease?\nIs it something about what magnesium does\nin cells or what calcium does in cells?\nAre we all magnesium\nand calcium deficient?\nWell, it turns out that's not the case.\nThe major effect by which magnesium and\ncalcium in water are likely to impact\nthings like blood pressure, cardiovascular\ndisease, and other aspects of cellular\nfunction turn out to be somewhat cryptic.\nBut we can make that cryptic aspect\nvery clear by saying that when we\nhave more magnesium in particular,\nbut also calcium present in our water,\nso-called hard water, you increase\nthe amount of hydrogen in that water.\nIt becomes what we call hydrogen rich\nand the pH of that water is increased.\nNow again, this does not mean that we are\ntrying to change the pH of the cells of\nour body in any kind of meaningful way.\nIn fact, we don't want to do that.\nWe want the pH of the cells of our\nbody to stay in particular ranges as\nI mentioned earlier, but having more\nmagnesium and more calcium in our water\nthat is increasing the hardness of our\nwater changes the pH of that water.\nAnd it turns out that the elevated pH\nof water, that is pH of water that tends\nto be somewhere between high sevens.\nSo we could say 7.9 up to even 9 or 9.2\nis going to be more readily absorbed and\nis going to more favorably impact the\nfunction of our cells than lower pH water.\nAgain, I wanna restate this because\nI'm a little bit concerned that\nmaybe a clip of this is gonna be\ntaken and, and send elsewhere.\nAnd someone will get the impression\nthat I'm saying that we actually want\nto drink high pH water, that we all\nneed to buy expensive high pH water.\nTurns out that's not the case.\nIf you are consuming tap water from a\nlocation where levels of a magnesium are\nsufficiently high in that tap water again,\nwhere the level of magnesium is 8.3 to\n19.4 milligrams per liter of water, that\nis, if the water coming out of your tap\nis hard enough, well then chances are you\ndon't need to enhance the pH of that water\nor change its magnesium concentration.\nIf, however, the water that you're\ndrinking from the tap filtered or\nnot, I would hope filtered contains\nless than 8.3 milligrams per liter of\nmagnesium, well then chances are the\npH of that water is going to be low\nenough that it's not going to be lending\nitself to some of the favorable health\ncomponents that higher pH water can.\nNotice, I did not say that lower pH\naka more acidic water is bad for you.\nI didn't say that.\nI said that higher pH\nwater can be good for you.\nSo let's talk about how and why\nhigher pH water can be good for you.\nAnd some of the best, and in fact,\nvery inexpensive sources of higher\npH magnesium enhanced or simply\ntap water that contains sufficient\nmagnesium can be used and accessed.\nMany of you are probably wondering whether\nor not you can simply boil your tap water\nand thereby decontaminate the tap water.\nThere I want to caution you,\nit turns out that some of the\ncontaminants present in water are\nactually made worse by heating water.\nAnd again, I don't want to open up you\nknow, a whole catalog of different fears.\nI, like all of you, I presume, use\nwater to cook pasta, rice, because I'm\nan omnivore, I do consume those things.\nI confess if I make Yerba Matte or any\nkind of tea or coffee, I tend to use\na higher quality water source than tap\nwater, even if that tap water is filtered,\nbecause I like the taste far more if I use\na really good source of water, and again,\nbecause I'm not consuming those beverages\nin enormous volumes, that becomes a,\na relatively inexpensive endeavor.\nBut I would caution people against\nusing boiling or heating of water\nas the only method to decontaminate\ntheir tap water and instead to\nalso rely on some of the filtration\nsystems that I talked about before.\nAnd as long as we're talking about\nthe temperature of water, there is\nsort of an ongoing debate online.\nIt's not a huge debate, but a number\nof people engaged in this debate as\nto whether or not drinking really\ncold water or room temperature water\nis better for you or worse for you.\nThis is a tough one to resolve.\nIt turns out that if water is very, very\ncold, that is if you drink it and you can\nfeel that cold water making its way down\nto your gut and you can actually feel it\nas cold within your gut, that's sort of a,\na you know, back of the envelope, , or I\nshould say direct within the gut measure\nof cold versus body temperature water,\nthat it is going to be slower to absorb.\nThat is you're gonna feel it sloshing\naround in your stomach for a bit\nlonger than if you were to consume\nwater that is slightly warmer.\nNow, that is not to say that\nyou should ingest warm water\nor room temperature water.\nHowever, many people find that when\nthey drink very cold water or ice water,\nthat indeed it can alter the kind of\nsensation of the lining of their stomach\nin ways that at least to them feel\nlike it's altering their digestion.\nAnd that makes sense.\nThe cells that line the gut\nare very temperature sensitive.\nYou want this so for a number of\nreasons, including not consuming\nfood that is excessively hot\nor cold or damaging your gut.\nBut in general, most people know\nthe temperature of fluid that\nthey want to ingest and ingest\nthat temperature of fluid.\nSo most people, for instance, on a\ncold day, want a warmer or hot fluid.\nDoes that mean that you're not going\nto absorb that warmer hot fluid?\nNo, of course it doesn't.\nYou're going to absorb that\nfluid one way or the other.\nSo drink fluids at the temperatures\nthat are to your liking in that moment.\nIn other words, what you desire in\nthat moment and don't worry so much\nabout trying to avoid cold beverages\nor trying to make sure that you're\nalways consuming room temperature\nwater as opposed to cold water.\nSo now with your understanding of\nhard water, soft water, magnesium, the\nrelationship between magnesium, calcium,\nand the pH of water, and remember our\nearlier conversation where we talked\nabout how higher pH water is actually\ngoing to move out of the gut and into\nthe body a bit more readily, and across\nthose aquaporin channels more readily\nthan lower pH, more acidic water.\nWell, that raises the question of\nwhether or not all these different forms\nof water that are out there, reverse\nosmosis water, distilled water, double\ndistilled water deuterium-depleted\nwater, alkaline water, as it's often\ncalled, whether or not any or all of\nthat has meaningful health outcomes.\nHere we can address some of\nthose items pretty quickly.\nFor instance, distilled water and\ndouble distilled water is essentially\ndistilled of that is it has magnesium\nand calcium removed from it.\nSo my recommendation would be\nto not drink distilled water.\nThere may be specific circumstances where\nsomebody has very high levels of blood\nmagnesium or calcium or calcium stores\nwithin the body that would necessitate\nthem drinking only distilled water.\nBut that seems like a very\nisolated kind of niche case.\nSo in general, consuming distilled\nwater is just simply not necessary.\nNow in terms of reverse osmosis\nwater, what is reverse osmosis water?\nReverse osmosis water is water that\nhas been passed repeatedly through a\nseries of filters that are designed\nto remove the kinds of contaminants\nwe were talking about earlier.\nSo some of the basic contaminants like\ndisinfectant byproducts, fluoride, and\nsome other large and small molecules\nthat leaves the water ideally still\ncontaining magnesium and calcium.\nAlthough there's some evidence that\nreverse osmosis water can deprive water\nof some of the magnesium and calcium.\nSo if you are going to use reverse\nosmosis filters and drink reverse\nosmosis water, you want to make\nsure that you're still getting the\nmagnesium concentrations present in\nthat water that we talked about earlier.\nBut in general, reverse osmosis water\nis considered safe, but, and for many\npeople, this is gonna be an important\nbut but very expensive to access.\nThe reverse osmosis filters require\na lot of changing of the filters.\nPurchasing reverse osmosis water in\nits stable form within containers,\nthese are typically glass containers,\nis going to be pretty expensive\nand prohibitive for most people.\nThat said, there are a number of\npeople out there that really like\nthe taste of reverse osmosis water.\nThey report it as feeling more smooth.\nThey think of reverse osmosis\nwater as \"giving them energy\".\nTo be quite honest, there's no direct\nstudies of the subjective sensation\nof water in the mouth and in the\ngut, and its relative health effects.\nAgain, the smoothness of water\nas one drinks it and goes down.\nThe gut really has no direct relationship\nto the \"hardness or softness\" of water.\nI know that's going to\nshock a number of you.\nYou probably think, well, hard\nwater is gonna be hard to drink, and\nit turns out that's not the case.\nIn fact, many people find that with\nelevated levels of magnesium and\ncalcium and water, it actually tastes\nsmoother or softer in their mouth.\nSo hard water tastes smooth or soft.\nI know it's all very counterintuitive,\nbut I think it's important to point this\nout because a number of times you'll\nhear or read about filtering water so\nthat it tastes smoother and better.\nAnd oftentimes that's happening\nbecause the \"hardness\" of water that\nis the concentrations of magnesium\nand calcium are actually increasing.\nSo if you're somebody who's curious about\nreverse osmosis water and you can afford\nthe filters or the reverse osmosis water\nalready pre-filtered please be my guest.\nYou know, drink it.\nI'm certainly not trying to prevent\nanyone from drinking it, but there's\nno peer reviewed evidence that I am\naware of that conclusively shows that\ndrinking reverse osmosis water is far\nbetter for us than drinking other types\nof water, provided the other types\nof water are adequately filtered of\nfluoride and the sorts of disinfectant\nbyproducts that we talked about earlier.\nSo what about hydrogen water?\nYou may have heard of this,\nor hydrogen enriched water or\nelectrolyzed reduced water as a way\nto access hydrogen enriched water.\nAll this might sound pretty\ncrazy to some of you.\nNow, fortunately, for sake of\ntoday's discussion, we can take a\nnumber of the different categories\nof, let's call it unique categories\nof water that have been described,\nincluding deuterium-depleted water.\nAnd by the way, deuterium is\nsomething that relates to the\npresence of hydrogen ions in water.\nAnd put very simply, water that is\nextracted from sources that are closer\nto sea level tend to have more deuterium\nin them than water that is extracted\nfrom sources further from sea level.\nSo up in the mountains, for instance, and\nfrom springs further away from oceans.\nAs you get closer to sea level, the\nsources water separate from seawater\ntend to have more deuterium, which\nrelates to the enrichment or lack\nof hydrogen within that water or\nfree hydrogen within that water.\nI warned you this was all gonna sound\npretty niche and that we were gonna get\na little bit into the chemistry, but now\nI'm gonna make it all very simple for\nyou, at least for the non aficionado.\nElectrolyzed reduced water, which is\na method of using electricity to alter\nthe confirmation of the water molecules\nand their rates of movement as well,\nas well as so-called hydrogen rich\nwater, or hydrogen enriched water or\ndeuterium-depleted water, all have the\nproperty of having higher levels of\npH than other forms of water, such as\ndistilled water, reverse osmosis water,\nand generally higher pH than the kind\nof water that comes out of your tap.\nUnless you live in a region where\nyour tap water has very high levels of\nmagnesium in it, which does occur in\ncertain regions of the world, but is not\nthat common more typically, the water\nthat comes out of your tap does not\nhave enough magnesium, meaning not as\nmuch magnesium in it as you would like.\nAnd this, I believe, explains in a\nfairly straightforward way why there is\nsuch an appeal of these pH enhanced or\nalkaline waters or electrolyzed reduced\nwater or deuterium-depleted water.\nThere are a couple of reasons, but\nfirst of all, anytime someone is\nconsuming a specialized form of water,\nchances are it's going to be filtered\nof the disinfectant byproducts,\nfluoride, and the other things that\nyou really don't want in water.\nSo already the water is going\nto be cleaner than would\nbe coming out of the tap.\nSo that's going to indirectly explain\na number of the so-called health\nbenefits, both subjective and perhaps\neven objective as we'll talk about\nthat can result from consuming these\nother let's say more esoteric forms of\nwater, at least not of simple tap water.\nHowever, if you look at hydrogen or\nhydrogen enriched water, you really need\nto take a step back and ask, what is that?\nYou know, what are we\nreally talking about?\nBecause it turns out that you can create\nhydrogen enriched water by putting tablets\nof magnesium itself, small amounts of\nmagnesium dissolving those in water.\nIt will give off a kind\nof gaseous solution.\nYou'll see a bunch of bubbling in there.\nYou certainly want to dilute that\ntablet and then consume the water.\nAnd yes, it's true what you've heard about\nand read from these commercial sources.\nYou do want to consume that water within\nabout, you know, five to 15 minutes\nafter that tablet completes dissolving.\nNow, why would you do this?\nAnd I should say that I have now started\ndoing this not because I necessarily think\nthat it's so necessary or so beneficial.\nI'll talk about my experience in a moment.\nI did it in anticipation of this\nepisode because I was researching\nwater and hydrogen enrich water\nand all these alkaline waters.\nAnd what became very clear to me\nbased on reading a fantastic two-part\nreview, it's a very extensive review\nentitled, or at least the first part\nis entitled: Electrolyzed Reduced Water\nMolecular Hydrogen is the Exclusive Agent\nResponsible for the Therapeutic Effects.\nAnd then there's a second\npart to this review.\nThis is how extensive it is, entitled:\nElectrolyzed Reduced Water number\ntwo, safety Concerns and Effectiveness\nas a source of Hydrogen Water.\nWhat this review, which we've linked\nto in the show notes, points to is that\nall of the health benefits of these\ndifferent forms of water that you hear\nabout out there, deuterium-depleted,\nhydrogen enrich, etc., all seem\nto boil down, no pun intended, no\nboiling included, I should say, to the\nelevation in hydrogen that translates\ninto, and here's the really meaningful\nchange, the elevation in pH that\noccurs when you hydrogen enrich water.\nNow, there are not a lot of\nclinical studies looking at hydrogen\nenriched water, but there are\nstarting to be more than a few.\nAnd one that I'd like to point out\nand that we'll link to, was published\nfairly recently, which is entitled\nHydrogen-rich water reduces inflammatory\nresponses and prevents apoptosis.\nApoptosis is a naturally occurring cell\ndeath during development and is generally\nused to describe cell death of the body.\nSometimes this can be good cell\ndeath, by the way, removing\ncells that need to be removed.\nAgain, the title of the paper is:\nHydrogen-Rich water reduces inflammatory\nresponses and prevents apoptosis of\nperipheral blood cells in healthy Adults.\nA randomized double\nblind controlled trial.\nNow this paper looked at the effects of\ndrinking 1.5 liters per day of hydrogen\nenriched water for a period of four weeks.\nThey did find significant positive\nbenefits of reduced inflammation, and\nthey found these changes by way of\nanalyzing things like interleukin 6\nand some of the other interleukins,\nwhich are markers of inflammation.\nThey controlled very nicely for the\nfact that people were still consuming\nother forms of water and liquid and\ncoffee, etc., although they made\nsure that they weren't consuming\ntoo much coffee and soda in addition\nto this hydrogen enriched water.\nBut what this paper shows is that\nindeed, increasing the free hydrogen\nin water can improve certain\nhealth metrics in these cells.\nAnd this is in keeping with some of the\nsubjective reports that people have stated\nout there, and that I myself experience,\nI have to say that by drinking hydrogen\nrich water, which I'll tell you how to\ndo fairly inexpensively in a moment,\nyou do get the subjective experience of\nhaving more energy, of \"feeling better\".\nNow, keep in mind, of course, the placebo\neffect is a very real and powerful\neffect, so it could just be placebo,\nalthough in this paper they did of\ncourse include a placebo group, so people\ndidn't know if they were getting hydrogen\nrich water or non hydrogen rich water.\nI should also mention that the\nimprovements in health metrics that they\nobserved in this study were only observed\nfor individuals older than 30 years old.\nWhy that is, I don't know, the conclusions\nthese authors came to in terms of how\nthese individuals older than 30 achieved\nlower levels, or I should say reduced\nlevels of inflammation and improved\nmarkers of other aspects of biological\nfunction is that the hydrogen water\nimproved the biological antioxidant\npotential of certain cell types.\nAnd again, the cell types that they\nmainly focus on were these peripheral\nblood cells in this particular study.\nNow, how could this be?\nWhy would this be?\nWell, this goes back to our earlier\ndiscussion about reduction in\nreactive oxygen species, so-called\nROSs, and reductions in free\nradicals that can damage cells.\nSo if all of this is sounding very\nconvoluted, I can understand why.\nHowever, what I like about this\nstudy and the two reviews that\nI mentioned a moment ago is that\nthese studies don't really say that\nhydrogen-rich water is what's essential.\nWhat these studies really point to is\nthat the changes in pH of water that\nenhancing the hydrogen in water can\ncreate, is what leads to the enhanced\neither absorption and or ability of\ncells to utilize that higher pH water.\nAgain, not by changing the pH of the body\nor of cells, but simply because higher pH\nwater or we could perhaps more accurately\nstate less acidic water, that is harder\nwater that contains more magnesium and\ncalcium, seems to be more readily used\nby the cells of the body and therefore\nit's very likely that the individuals\nin this study were achieving  higher\nor more efficient levels of hydration.\nOkay, so if any of this is\nconfusing, let me be very clear.\nI do not believe that we all need to\ndrink deuterium-depleted water or that\nwe all need to drink electrolyzed reduced\nwater, nor do I necessarily believe that\nwe all need to drink hydrogen rich water.\nHowever, it's very clear to me that\nall these different forms of water are\nbetter absorbed and therefore lead to\nbetter and more efficient hydration, and\ntherefore can reduce inflammation, blood\npressure, and improve a number of other\nhealth metrics because of the elevated pH\nthat all of these different purification\nor water treatment methods achieve.\nAnd that elevated pH, again, is not\nchanging the pH of the cells and\ntissues and organs of your body.\nYou actually don't want that, rather that\nelevated pH is simply making the water\nless acidic than it would be otherwise.\nSo the simple takeaway is this, if\nyour tap water contains sufficient\nmagnesium per the values that we\ntalked about earlier, I don't think\nyou need to hydrogen enrich your water.\nI do however, suggest that you at least\nanalyze your water or look at some of\nthe professional analysis of water that\nyou can achieve online and filter out\ndisinfectant byproducts and fluorides,\netc., from that magnesium, or I should say\nsufficiently magnesium containing water.\nOkay?\nPut simply, if your tap water has\nenough magnesium, filter it, but drink\nit and I think you're doing just fine.\nIf, however, the levels of magnesium in\nyour tap water are not above that value\nthat we talked about earlier in that\ncase, I do think, and I can completely\nunderstand why enriching the amount of\nhydrogen in that water can make that\nwater not only more palatable, right?\nGive you the sensation that it's\nsofter or smoother or more enjoyable to\ndrink than more acidic water would be.\nBut also that that water is going\nto be far more effective in being\nabsorbed and hydrating in the cells and\ntissues of your body, which turns out\nto be very important for an enormous\nrange, perhaps every biological\nfunction within your brain and body.\nSo how can you hydrogen enrich your water?\nThat actually can be done\nfairly inexpensively.\nI've been doing that as I mentioned\nearlier, as part of an experiment in\npreparation for this episode, because\nit turns out that the water that comes\nout of my tap has very little magnesium\nin it and very little calcium as well.\nThe way to create hydrogen-rich water\nis you can simply purchase molecular\nhydrogen tablets, which in reality are\njust magnesium tablets that dissolve in\nwater and create a free hydrogen that can\ninteract with the other water molecules.\nNow, the chemistry behind it has\nbeen substantiated, and I'll provide\na link in the show note captions to\na paper that gets into some fairly\nextensive detail about the way that\nhaving an additional hydrogen in your\nwater can adjust the flow of electrons\nand the adjustment of free radicals.\nBut keep in mind, again, this is all\nthrough increases in the pH of your water,\nand please keep in mind that you can't\nsimply take any other or any old magnesium\ntablet or capsule and put it into water.\nThe configuration of the magnesium\nin these capsules and tablets is such\nthat it allows a rapid dissolving\nof the tablet and the activation\nof the free hydrogen that can\ninteract with the water molecules.\nAgain, there are only a few\nscientific studies exploring\nthe real biological effects of\nthese activated hydrogen waters.\nThe dissolvable tablets are the far\nless expensive way to go than purchasing\npre-packaged and sealed hydrogen water.\nIn fact, I don't recommend those brands\nbecause they are quite expensive and\nit's not clear how stable the activated\nor free hydrogen is in those waters.\nIn any case, this is certainly not\nsomething that everyone needs to do.\nI mention it because I have had\na good experience with it myself.\nI also will mention again that I\nhave no business or affiliation\nto any of these products.\nI'll provide a link to a few of them\nin the show note captions for those\nof you that want to experiment.\nAnd indeed, that's why I'm telling\nyou this, for those of you that want\nto experiment with raising the pH of\nyour water without having to purchase\nwhat is ordinarily quite expensive,\nhigher pH water, you can do this with\nthese dissolvable magnesium tablet.\nMy experience with them\nhas been quite good.\nIn fact, I plan to continue to\nuse them once or twice a day.\nThis is not the sort of thing\nthat you need to do in all\nthe water that you drink.\nI want to repeat, even if you go down\nthis path and you find that you really\nlike the activated hydrogen tablet\napproach, it is not the case that you\nwant to put these in all of your water,\nand you certainly don't want to put\nthem in carbonated waters of any kind.\nThat will lead to a lot of gastric\ndiscomfort, nor do you want to put\nthem into hot liquids of any kind.\nSo again, this is the sort of thing\nthat you do once or twice, maybe three\ntimes a day, and you can find out for\nyourself and sort of measure subjectively\nwhether or not you like the experience\nand whether or not you \"feel better\".\nNow, earlier in the episode we\nwere discussing structured water\nor this fourth phase of water.\nI know a number of people out there are\ncurious as to whether or not ingesting\nstructured water is somehow better for\nus than ingesting non-structured water.\nAll I can say about this is that it is\na very controversial thing to suggest\nthat structured water is somehow\nmore biologically effective or better\nfor us than non-structured water.\nThere are a number of different ways\nthat one can create structured water.\nThey involve some pretty extensive and\nexpensive at-home systems ranging anywhere\nfrom a couple of hundred dollars to\na couple of thousand dollars or more.\nTo be quite direct, when one goes into\nthe peer reviewed scientific literature,\none will not find that is there is\nessentially no real evidence that\ningesting structured water leads to any\nspecific desired biological outcomes.\nNow, as I say that, I'm sure there\nare people out there who have still\nhad tremendous experiences ingesting\nstructured water, whether or not that's\ndue to a placebo effect or a real effect\nof ingesting structured water isn't clear.\nJust to give you a sense of what my\nstance is on things like structured\nwater, I think that they are interesting\nand intriguing, but as a scientist, in\nthe absence of any quality peer review\ndata at present, I can't really suggest\nthat people go out and start ingesting\nstructured water nor that they adhere\nto the claims that structured water\nis going to be really, really good for\nthem compared to other forms of water.\nThat said, I do think that there's\nan interesting and open space for\nfurther exploration of the biological\neffects of structured water given the\nfact that structured water does exist.\nI don't think anyone debates that,\nand the fact that the different\nstructures of water in this fourth\nphase of water as we're calling it,\nhas been shown to interface with solids\nand other aspects of liquids and can\ndo so within organelles of cells.\nSo different components of\ncells that control different\nfunctions, including mitochondria.\nI think there's a potential there,\nwhether or not there's a promise\nthere, is a another question entirely.\nSo I don't wanna shut the\ndoor on structured water.\nI think this is an open question\nthat I hope there will be more\ndata to answer those questions\nin the not too distant future.\nAnd meanwhile, if any of you are aware\nof good clinical studies exploring\nthe biological effects of structured\nwater in either animal models or\nhumans, please put those references\nin the comments on YouTube because I'm\nvery curious as to how this area of\nbiological effects of structured water\nis evolving and continues to evolve.\nSo today we discussed water, and\nadmittedly we went into a lot of\ndetail about the physics and chemistry\nof water in its various forms.\nAnd we talked about hydration because\nI think that's the main reason\nwhy many of you are interested\nin or concerned about water.\nWe also talked about contaminants\nand tap water, which unfortunately\ndo exist and are very prominent in\nessentially all regions of the world.\nSo please do get some information\nabout what's coming out of your tap.\nI also wanna throw in one other piece of\ninformation that's really critical that\nI learned about when researching this\nepisode, which is the quality of water\nthat comes out of your tap is not just\ndictated by the source that it comes\nfrom external to your home or apartment,\nyour pipes are also important, and that\nfilter, or that little mesh that sits at\nthe faucet head is also very important.\nMost people don't pay attention to that,\nbut it turns out that a lot of debris\nand contaminants can be derived from\nthat little filter that most people just\nsimply aren't cleaning often enough.\nSo here, I'm not trying to tell you\nthat the metal or the plastic that\nthat filter is made of is a problem.\nMore often than not, contaminants are\nshowing up in water because people aren't\ncleaning those filters often enough.\nAnd in fact, prior to researching\nthis episode, I didn't ever\nthink to clean that filter.\nI looked underneath my faucet and while\nthat filter didn't look particularly\nfilled with debris, I did find that when\nI took it off and I looked at the other\nsign, there was quite a lot of debris.\nSo if you are going to consume tap\nwater, you definitely want to consider\nthe source, the pipes in your building\nor apartment, the ones that lead right\nup to your glass or jug that you would\nput that water into, and also that\nmesh that that water passes through\nas it goes into that glass or jug.\nWe also talked about\nhow much water to drink.\nI hope that we finally\nresolve that question.\nFor those of you that have\nbeen wondering about that.\nThe Galpin equation is a wonderful\napproach to how much water\nto consume during exercise.\nAnd by providing these other formulas\nof about 8 ounces or 240 milliliters\nof water per hour for the 10 hours\nfrom waking until post waking on\naverage, remember it's averages.\nYou don't have to consume them every hour\non the hour, and no need to be neurotic.\nHopefully you can achieve better\nlevels of hydration, which we know can\nlead to reductions in blood pressure\nimprovements in appetite, mood, and focus.\nAnd I really think that it's the\nimprovements in cognitive focus and\nphysical ability, both endurance strength\nand other forms of kind of readiness\nin the body, readiness to perform\nwork in the body that really are best\nsupported by the hydration literature.\nAnd then of course, we went through the\ndifferent forms of water that you hear\nabout out there and addressed which ones\nare going to be beneficial or not and\nperhaps more importantly, why any of\nthem  would be beneficial thinking about\nthat from the perspective of biologists\nand the chemistry of water, and I do\nhope that by arriving at this point in\nthe episode, now that you have a much\nbetter understanding of the chemistry\nand physics of water and the way that\nwater can powerfully impact your biology.\nIf you're learning from and or\nenjoying this podcast,
