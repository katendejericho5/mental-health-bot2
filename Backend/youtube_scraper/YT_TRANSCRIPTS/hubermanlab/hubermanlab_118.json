    "transcript": "Andrew Huberman: [OPENING THEME\nMUSIC] Welcome to the Huberman Lab\npodcast, where we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm a Professor\nof Neurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr.\nOded Rechavi.\nDr.\nOded Rechavi is a Professor\nof Neurobiology at Tel\nAviv University in Israel.\nHis laboratory studies\ngenetic inheritance.\nNow, everybody is familiar with\ngenetic inheritance as the idea\nthat we inherit genes from our\nparents, and indeed, that is true.\nMany people are also probably now\naware of the so called epigenome,\nthat is, ways in which our environment\nand experiences can change our genome\nand therefore the genes that we\ninherit or pass on to our children.\nWhat is less known, however, and what\nis discussed today, is the evidence\nthat we can actually pass on traits\nthat relate to our experiences.\nThat's right.\nThere is evidence in worms, in flies,\nin mice, and indeed in human beings,\nthat memories can indeed be passed\nfrom one generation to the next.\nAnd that turns out to be just the\ntip of the iceberg in terms of how\nour parents' experiences, and our\nexperiences can be passed on from one\ngeneration to the next, both in terms\nof modifying the biological circuits of\nthe brain and body and the psychological\nconsequences of those biological changes.\nDuring today's episode, Dr.\nRejave gives us a beautiful\ndescription of how genetics work.\nSo even if you don't have a background\nin biology or science, by the end of\ntoday's episode, you will understand\nthe core elements of genetics\nand the genetic passage of traits\nfrom one generation to the next.\nIn addition, he makes it clear how certain\nexperiences can indeed modify our genes\nsuch that they are passed from our parents\nto us, and even transgenerationally\nacross multi generations.\nThat is, one generation could\nexperience something, and their\ngrandchildren would still have genetic\nmodifications that reflect those prior\nexperiences of their grandparents.\nDr.\nRechavi takes us on an incredible\njourney explaining how our genes and\ndifferent patterns of inheritance shape\nour experience of life and who we are.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme, I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all-American swimmers from\nStanford, and everything about\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses were\ndesigned with performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working on the\nbiology of the visual system, and I can\ntell you that your visual system has\nto contend with an enormous number of\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly under any conditions.\nRoka understands this and\nhas designed their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses accordingly.\nOriginally, Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed for sport, that is, for\nthings like running and cycling, and many\nof the features they have reflect that.\nSo, for instance, they are extremely\nlightweight, they won't slip off\nyour face if you get sweaty, and\nthey can indeed be worn for running\nand cycling and things of that sort.\nHowever, they also come in a number\nof different aesthetics and styles\nthat make them perfectly suited,\nnot just for sport, but also for\nwearing to the office, to work.\nIf you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses\nor sunglasses, go to Roka, that's\nR-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com,\nenter the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by HVMN Ketone IQ.\nKetone IQ is a ketone supplement\nthat increases blood ketones.\nAnd most everybody has heard of\nthe so-called ketogenic diet.\nMost people, including myself,\ndo not follow a ketogenic diet.\nThat does not, however, mean that ketones\ncannot be valuable because ketones are\none of the primary sources of brain\nfuel and body fuel that allows us to\nthink clearly for long durations of\ntime and to perform well physically.\nWhich is all to say that even if you're\nsomebody who's not on a ketogenic diet,\nsuch as myself, increasing your blood\nketones can be immensely beneficial\nfor cognitive and physical performance.\nIndeed, that's how I use KetoneIQ.\nI'll take one or two servings per\nday typically, sometimes before a\nworkout, but most typically before\ndoing a bout of cognitive work.\nSo I'm going to sit down\nand prepare a podcast.\nor focus on research for my lab or\na writing project or anything that\nrequires a high degree of concentration\nfor a prolonged period of time,\ningesting ketone IQ prior to that, I've\nnoticed greatly increases my level of\nconcentration and I can sustain that\nconcentration for much longer periods\nof time than if I don't take ketone IQ.\nIf you'd like to try ketone\nIQ, you can go to hvmn.com\nslash Huberman to save 20% off.\nAgain, that's hvmn.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nSo I've talked about many times\nbefore on the podcast, there's\na critical relationship between\nsleep and temperature and indeed\nbetween waking up and temperature.\nThat is your body temperature needs\nto decrease by about one to three\ndegrees in order for you to fall\nand stay deeply asleep at night.\nAnd when you wake up in the morning,\nin order to do that feeling refreshed,\nyour body temperature actually needs to\nincrease by about one to three degrees.\nSo it's critical that you control\nthe temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and that temperature be\ncontrolled very specifically across\nthe night and into the morning.\nWith EightSleep mattress covers,\nthat's all extremely easy to do.\nYou can program the temperature\nof your mattress in the beginning,\nmiddle, and throughout the\nnight, and when you wake up.\nI've been sleeping on an 8Sleep mattress\ncover for over a year now, and it has\ngreatly improved the quality of my sleep.\nAnd indeed, I know that because EightSleep\nalso includes a terrific sleep tracker\nbuilt directly into that mattress cover.\nIf you'd like to try EightSleep, you\ncan go to eightsleep.com/huberman  to\nsave $150 off their pod three cover.\nEightSleep currently ships in\nthe USA, Canada, UK, select\ncountries in the EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's 8sleep.com slash Huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion with Dr.\nOded Rechavi . Oded, thank\nyou so much for being here.\nOded Rechavi: Totally my pleasure.\nAndrew Huberman: This podcast has\na somewhat unusual origin because I\nam familiar with your work, but we\nessentially met on Twitter, where you\nare known for many things, but lately,\nespecially, you have been focusing\nnot just on the discoveries in your\nlaboratory and other laboratories,\nbut also sort of meme type humor that\nrelates to the scientific process.\nAnd we'll return to\nthis a little bit later.\nBut first of all, I think it's wonderful\nthat you're so active on social\nmedia in this positive stance around\nscience that also includes humor.\nBut today, what I mainly want to talk\nabout is the incredible questions\nthat you probe in your lab, which\nare highly unusual, incredibly\nsignificant for each and all of our\nlives, and very controversial, and\nat times even a little bit dangerous\nor morbid, so this is going to be a\nfun one for me and for the audience.\nJust to start off very basically and\nget everyone up to speed, because people\nhave different backgrounds, I think most\npeople have a general understanding of\nwhat genes are, what RNA is, and so on.\nBut maybe you could explain to people in\nvery basic terms, and I'll just preface\nall this by saying that I think most\npeople understand that if they have\ntwo blue eyed parents, that there's a\nhigher probability that their offspring\nwill have blue eyes than brown eyes.\nSimilarly, if two brown eyed parents,\nhigher probability that they will have\nbrown eyes rather than blue eyes, and\nso on, but that most people generally\nunderstand and accept that if they spend\npart of their life, let's say, studying\narchitecture, that if they have children,\nthat there's no real genetic reason\nwe should assume that their children\nwould somehow be better at architecture\nbecause they contain the knowledge\nthrough the DNA of their parents.\nThey might be exposed to it in the\nhome, so called nature nurture.\nThat's nurture in that case,\nbut that they wouldn't inherit\nknowledge or other traits.\nAnd today I'm hoping you can\nexplain to us why eye color, but not\nknowledge is thought to be inherited.\nAnd the huge landscape of interesting\nquestions that this opens up,\nincluding some evidence that, contrary\nto what we might think, certain\ntypes of knowledge at the level of\ncells and systems can be inherited.\nSo that was a very long winded opening.\nBut to frame things up, what\nis DNA, what is RNA, and how\ndoes inheritance really work?\nOded Rechavi: Okay, so DNA is the\nmaterial, the genetic instructions that\nis contained in every one of our cells.\nWe have the set of genes containing\nthe entire set, called the genome.\nAnd this is present in\nevery cell of our body.\nThe same set of instructions.\nAnd genes are made of DNA, and\nthey also contain chromosomes.\nChromosomes are the DNA and the proteins\nthat condense the DNA, because we have\na huge amount of DNA in every cell\nthat you need to condense it, too.\nAndrew Huberman: Sort of like\nthread on a spool, right?\nOded Rechavi: Huge amount\nthat you have to condense.\nAnd we have the same genome, the\nsame DNA in every cell in our body.\nAndrew Huberman: Can I just interrupt?\nAnd I'll do that periodically,\njust to make sure that people\nare being carried along.\nI sometimes find that even remarkable,\nthat a skin cell and a brain\ncell, a neuron, for instance, very\ndifferent functions, but they all\ncontain the full menu of genes.\nAnd the same menu of genes.\nOded Rechavi: No, it is amazing.\nIt is amazing.\nAnd perhaps it's good to have an\nanalogy to understand how it works.\nSo I hope this is not a commercial,\nbut this is like the IKEA book that\nyou have in every cell in your body,\nthe instructions to make everything\nthat you need in your house, the\nchairs, the kitchen, the pictures.\nBut in every room, you\nwant something else.\nSo in the kitchen, you want things that\nfit the kitchen, and in the toilet,\nyou want things that fit the toilet.\nSo you only remove one particular\npage of instructions, which is the\ninstructions of how to build a chair.\nAnd this you place in the living room.\nAnd the toilet, you put in the toilet.\nSo the DNA is the instruction\nto make the genome, is the\ninstruction to make everything.\nThis is the IKEA book.\nAnd in every cell, we take just the\ninstructions to make one particular\nfurniture and this is the RNA.\nThis is the RNA.\nThis is a set.\nAnd then in the end, you'll build a chair.\nThe chair is the protein.\nSo the RNA is our instructions to\nmake one particular protein based\non the entire set of possibilities.\nAnd this is true for one particular type\nof RNA, which won't be the star of this\nconversation, which is messenger RNA.\nThis is the RNA that contains the\ninformation for making proteins.\nIn fact, this is just a small\npercent of the RNA in the cell.\nSo we have a very big genome,\nand less than 2% of it encodes\nfor this messenger RNA.\nHowever, a lot of the genome\nis transcribed to make RNA\nthat does other things.\nSome of these RNAs we understand,\nand many of them we don't.\nAndrew Huberman: It's a beautiful\ndescription, and IKEA is not a\nsponsor of the podcast, so it's\ntotally fair game to use the IKEA\ncatalog as the analogy for DNA.\nThe specific instructions for\nspecific pieces of furniture is the\nRNA, and the furniture pieces being\nthe proteins that are essentially\nmade from RNA using messenger RNA.\nOded Rechavi: Correct.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, thank you for that.\nSo, despite the fact that the same\ngenes are contained in all the cells\nof the body, there is a difference\nbetween certain cell types, right?\nIs it fair to say that there was basically\none very important exception, which\nis somatic cells versus germ cells?\nAnd would you mind sharing with\nus what that distinction is?\nOded Rechavi: Sure.\nSo, yes, every cell type is different\nbecause it brings into action\ndifferent genes from the entire\ncollection and assumes an identity.\nWe have cells in the legs,\nwe have cells in the brain.\nWe have in the brain.\nWe have cells that produce dopamine,\ncells that produce serotonin, and so on.\nAnd we can make different separation,\ndifferent distinctions, but we can make\none very important distinction between\nthe somatic cells and the germ cells.\nThe germ cells are supposed to be\nthe only cells that contribute to\nthe next generation, out of which\nthe next generation will be made.\nSo each of us is made just from a\ncombination of a sperm and an egg.\nThese are two types of germ cells,\nand then they fuse, and you get one\nfertilized egg, and out of this one cell,\nall the rest of the body will develop.\nAnd what happens in the soma, which are\nall the cells that are not the germ cells,\nshould stay in the soma, should not be\nable to contribute to the next generation.\nThis is very important and is thought\nto be one of the main barriers for\nthe inheritance of acquired traits,\nthe inheritance of memory and so on.\nBecause, for example, like the example\nthat you gave with learning architecture,\nif I learn about architecture, the\ninformation is encoded in my brain.\nAnd since my brain cells can't transfer\ninformation to the sperm and the egg,\nbecause the information is supposed\nto reside in synaptic connections\nbetween different neurons in a\nparticular circuit that developed.\nSo, what happens is the brain shouldn't be\nable to transfer to the next generation.\nEven simpler, a simpler example,\nif you go to the gym and you build\nup muscles, you know that your kids\nwill have to work out on their own.\nThis shortcut won't happen.\nThis is something that we know\nintuitively, even if we don't\nhave any background in biology.\nAnd this is connected to the fact\nthat, as we said at the beginning,\nevery cell in the body has its own\ngenome and the next generation will\nonly form from the combination of\nthe genomes in the sperm and the egg.\nEven if you somehow acquire the mutation\nor a change in your DNA in one particular\nbrain cell, it wouldn't matter, because\nthis mutation, there's no way to transfer\nit to the DNA of the germ cells that\nwill contribute to the next generation.\nAndrew Huberman: So despite that, there\nis, as you will tell us, some evidence for\ninheritance of experience, let's call it.\nAnd here we have to be\ncareful with the language.\nI just want to put a big asterisk and\nunderline and highlight that the language\naround what we're about to talk about\nis both confusing and at the same time\nfairly simple and controversial, right?\nIt's a little bit like in the field of\nlongevity, people sometimes will say\nanti-aging, some people say longevity.\nThe anti-aging folks feel that longevity\nis more about longevity clinics.\nThey don't like that anti-aging is\nrelated to some other kind of niche\nclinics, sometimes FDA approved or\ngovernment approved, sometimes not.\nAnd so there's a lot of argument\nabout the naming, but it's all about\nliving longer and living healthier.\nIn this field of acquiring traits or\nthe passage of information to offspring,\nwhat is the proper language to refer\nto what we're about to discuss?\nThere is this idea, and I'll say it so\nthat you don't have to, that dates back\nto Lamarck and Lamarckian evolution.\nVery controversial, right?\nAnd maybe not even controversial.\nI think it's very offensive\neven to certain people.\nThis idea of inheritance of acquired\ntraits, the idea that one could change\nthemselves through some activity, let's\nuse the example of going to the gym.\nWe could also use the example of somebody\nwho becomes an endurance runner, then\ndecides to have children within another\nendurance runner, and has in mind the\nidea that because they did all this\nrunning and not just because they were\nbiased towards running in the first\nplace, but because of the distance\nthey actually ran, that their offspring\nsomehow would be fabulous runners.\nOkay, this Lamarckian concept\nis, we believe, wrong.\nSo how do we talk about\ninheritance of acquired traits?\nWhat's the proper language for\nus to frame this discussion?\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nWe have to be very careful, as\nyou said, and there are many\ncomplications and many ambiguities.\nAndrew Huberman: And maybe you could\ntell us why Lamarckian evolution,\nfor those that don't know, is\nsuch a stained thing, r ight?\nI t's not polite.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nPerhaps we'll start with, just say\nthat we can talk about inheritance\nof acquired traits, transmission\nof parental responses, inheritance\nof memory, all of these things.\nAnd we can also talk about epigenetics\nand transgenerational epigenetics\nand intergenerational epigenetics.\nThere are many terms that we need\nto make clear for the audience.\nThe reason that is so toxic or\ncontroversial is very complicated,\nand it goes a long time back,\neven way before Lamarck.\nSo even the Greeks talked\nabout inheritance acquired.\nLamarck is associated with the term, but\nit's probably a mistake, although everyone\ntalks about including people who studied.\nSo Lamarck worked, he published his\nbook a little more than 200 years ago.\nAnd he believed in the\ninheritance of acquired traits.\nAbsolutely.\nBut just like anyone else in his\ntime, just everyone believed in it.\nIt seemed obvious to them.\nIt was long before Mendel and\nthe rules of genetic inheritance.\nAnd also Mendel was long before\nthe understanding that DNA\nis the heritable material.\nSo this happened a long time ago.\nEveryone believed in it, including Darwin.\nDarwin was perhaps more\nLamarckian than Lamarck.\nAndrew Huberman: Really?\nOded Rechavi: Yes, absolutely.\nAndrew Huberman: All right, now\nwe're getting into the meat of it.\nOded Rechavi: And this is in The Origin of\nthe Species . It's in all of his writings.\nLamarck didn't even really make the\ndistinction between the generations.\nHe had many other reasons for being wrong,\nbut he connected the terms inheritance\nof acquired traits to evolution.\nAnd this is some of the reasons that he\nwas very controversial, even in his time.\nThere were other reasons.\nFor example, he rejected current day\nchemistry and thought that he could\nexplain everything based on Aristotelian\nfluids; earth, wind, fire and water.\nAndrew Huberman: There's still some\npeople on the Internet that think they can\ndiscard chemistry and explain everything\nbased on earth, wind, fire, and water.\nOded Rechavi: And this wasn't\nonly biology, it was also\nthe weather and everything.\nSo that was part of the reason Lamarck\nmade many mistakes, but he did have a\nfull tier of inheritance, which was a\nbig step towards where we are today.\nSo he had important contributions\nnevertheless, although he was\nmistaken about the mechanism.\nWhat he believed, like everyone\nelse, drives evolution, is the\ntransmission of the traits that\nyou acquire during your life or\nthe things that you do or don't do.\nWe talked about use and disuse\nof certain organs that shape our\norgans and eventually also the\norgans of the next generation.\nAndrew Huberman: He sounds\na little bit like the first\nself-help public figure, right?\nWell, this mean, this is heavily\nembedded into a lot of the health and\nfitness space on Twitter and Instagram\nand on the Internet, which is that,\nit's the idea that we're sold very\nearly in life, at least here in the\nUnited States and probably elsewhere,\nwhich is that we can become anything\nthat we want to become and that that\nwill forever change the offspring,\neither because of nature or nurture.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAnd this is a very dangerous\nidea, as I'll explain in a second.\nAnd it led to horrible things.\nThis is part of the reason\nthat this is such a taboo.\nIt's not only self-help you're\nhelping, or this helping yourself.\nThe problem is when you apply to others.\nAnd this happened in a very, very\ndramatic and horrible way in the\nrecent past, as I'll tell in a second.\nSo Lamarck, this is what he\nbelieved and he thought this\nis how evolution progressed.\nAnd later Darwin showed that\nit's really natural selection.\nThe selecting of the organisms that\nalready contain the particular qualities\nare selected based on whether they survive\nor not in particular environments, and\ntherefore their evolution progresses,\nthey are more common and take over.\nThis is very different.\nTwo different explanations.\nThe most common way this is contrasted\nis the neck of the giraffes.\nThis is a classic example.\nAccording to Lamarck, the giraffes\nhad to stretch their necks towards the\ntrees to eat when the trees were high.\nAnd because of that, they transmitted\nthese traits, long necks, to their\nchildren, who also had long necks.\nBy the way, he only mentioned\nthis example a handful of times,\nhe didn't really focus on that.\nAnd according to Darwin, just a\ngiraffe that happened to be born with\na long neck survived because it ate.\nSo its genetic, heritable materials\ndidn't know about genetics, but take over.\nAnd the rest of the giraffes that have\ndifferent heritable materials just die.\nSo this is natural selection versus\ninheritance for acquired traits.\nSo this is natural selection versus\ninheritance for acquired traits.\nThere are many reasons why Lamarckism\nand inheritance for acquired\ntraits became such a bad term.\nOne of the biggest is what happened\nin the Soviet Union under Stalin.\nThere was a scientist named Lysenko, who\nthought that Mendelism, normal genetics,\nis bourgeois science, shouldn't be done.\nAnd whoever did normal genetics was\neither killed or sent to Siberia.\nAnd he thought that, just like you said,\nnot only we can become everything that\nwe want, but we can grow everything that\nwe want in every field, can take a frozen\nfield and grow potatoes there and so on.\nAnd this led to massive starvation, ruined\nagriculture in the Soviet Union, also\nruined science for many, many years, and\nput a very dark cloud on the entire field.\nAnd only probably in the 80s\nor something like this, the\nfield started to recuperate.\nFor that aside, for that, which is a\nvery dramatic thing, there were also\ncrazy stories around, and attempts to\nprove the inheritance of acquired traits.\nDespite the realization of many\nscientists, this is something that\nis very rare, or that normally\ndoesn't happen, that is not a\nnormal way that inheritance works.\nAnd I can tell you about two such\ndramatic cases that will illustrate it.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, please.\nOded Rechavi: So, in the beginning\nof the 20th century, in Vienna, there\nwas a researcher called Paul Kammerer,\nwho was a very famous and also very\ncolorful figure, who did experiments\non many different types of animals.\nHe did experiments on toads\nthat are called the midwife toad\nbecause the male carries the eggs.\nAnd there's a beautiful book\nabout it from Koestler, telling\nthe story of what happened there.\nAnd there are a couple of types of toads.\nSome of them live underwater\nand some of them live on land.\nAnd these toads are different in\ntheir shape and in their behavior.\nSo, of course, the capacity to live\nunderwater is one thing, but also their\nmorphology and appearance changes.\nThe toads that live underwater develop\nthese nuptial pads, these black pads\non their hands that allow the males to\ngrab onto the female without slipping.\nAndrew Huberman: For mating.\nOded Rechavi: For mating.\nAnd the ones on land don't have them.\nHe claimed that he can take the toads and\ntrain them to live underwater, changing\nthe temperature and all kinds of things.\nIt's a very difficult animal to work with.\nEventually, according to Kammerer,\nthey will acquire the capacity to\nlive underwater and also change\ntheir physiology and develop these\nblack nuptial pads on their hands.\nWith this discovery, he traveled\nthe world, became very famous.\nThis was in just the beginning of the\nprevious century, as the person who found\nthe proof for inheritance of acquired\ntraits, despite the controversy and so on.\nIn the beginning of the realization of\nhow it actually works with DNA and so on,\nnot with DNA, but with natural selection.\nDNA came later and people\ndidn't believe him.\nHe was actually under a lot of attacks,\nbut it seemed convincing at the end.\nWhat happens is that they found\nthat he injected ink to the\ntoads to make them become black.\nTo have these nuptial pads.\nSo he faked the results, and he couldn't\nstand the accusations and killed himself.\nAndrew Huberman: Wow.\nOded Rechavi: In this book by\nKoestler , it suggests maybe it\nwas the assistant who did it.\nAndrew Huberman: Who killed?\nOded Rechavi: No, no.\nWho injected it to sort\nof save him from failure.\nBecause the samples lost the\ncoloring or something like that.\nSo it might be.\nWho knows what happened?\nAndrew Huberman: Well, in science,\nwhenever there's a fraud accusation\nor controversy, it's not uncommon\nto see a passing of responsibility.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: There are recent\ncases, there are ongoing cases now where\nit's a question of who did what, etc.\nActually, I have two questions.\nBefore the second story, I'm struck by the\nidea that he was traveling and talking.\nI'm guessing this was before\nPowerPoint and Keynote, but also before\ntransparencies, which actually were still\nin place when I was a graduate student.\nFor those of you who don't know,\ntransparencies are basically transparent\npieces of plastic paper that you put\nonto a projector, and then you can write\non them and do demonstrations, but can\nshow photographs and things like that.\nSo how was he giving these talks,\nand would he travel with the toads?\nOded Rechavi: So he\ntraveled with the samples.\nAndrew Huberman: I see.\nOded Rechavi: And I'm basing this\non this Koestler book, which is,\non its own, very controversial.\nIt's more of a beautiful\nstory than perhaps the truth.\nAnd according to the story there,\nhe had to stand on one side of the\nlecture hall with his hands behind his\nback while others would examine the\nsamples and pass them around and so on.\nAndrew Huberman: But he cheated.\nSomeone cheated.\nOded Rechavi: He probably did.\nAt least that's what most people think.\nBut this wasn't replicated.\nI mean, also, I don't think\nanyone tried to replicate it.\nAndrew Huberman: Interesting.\nThis is just a point about replication.\nAnd actually, another tragic example,\nnot but a few years ago, Sasai, who,\nas far as we knew, was doing very\naccomplished work on the growth of\nretinas, literally growing eyes in a dish.\nI think everyone believes that result.\nBut then there were some accusations\nabout another result that turned out to\nbe fraudulent, and Sasai killed himself.\nThis was only about\nmaybe five, 10 years ago.\nSo it still happens.\nOded Rechavi: Yeah, it happens.\nI think it's rare, but it does\nhappen, especially in this\nvery high profile situation.\nAndrew Huberman: I would argue.\nI'd love to know what your number\nis, but I would argue that 99% of\nscientists are seeking truth and\nare well meaning, honest people.\nOded Rechavi: I totally agree.\nAnd I think that even when people are\nwrong, it's mostly not because they're\nevil and trying to act inflated.\nMaybe they don't really want to believe\nthe results, or there are all kinds\nof ways to be wrong and even to bend\nthe truth without just blatant fraud.\nBut this is, according to the\nstory, an example of very bad fraud,\nwhich, I agree, is rare because most\nscientists, as you said, this is\nalso my opinion, are just trying to\ndiscover truth and do the best they can.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, why\nelse would you go into it?\nBecause it's certainly not a profession\nto go into if you want to get rich.\nOded Rechavi: Not for the money.\nAndrew Huberman: And it's probably\nnot even a profession to go\ninto if you want to get famous.\nIf you want to be famous, you\nshould go to Hollywood or become\na serial killer because they'll\nmake specials about please don't.\nBut please don't do either.\nNo, Hollywood, I suppose for some\nis fine, but in any case, okay,\nso Kammerer, around 1907, 1906?\nOded Rechavi: This is slightly\nbefore the controversy broke\nout after the First World War.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, yeah, great.\nKammerer is gone.\nHis toads with their either ink\nor whatever nuptial pads they\nhave to go back to mating on land.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin, mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic Greens\nsince 2012, so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking Athletic\nGreens and the reason I still take\nAthletic Greens once or usually\ntwice a day is that it gets me the\nprobiotics that I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by gut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the immune\nsystem, and basically all the biological\nsystems of our body to strongly impact\nour immediate and long term health.\nAnd those probiotics in\nAthletic Greens are optimal and\nvital for microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic Greens contains\na number of adaptogens, vitamins and\nminerals that make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs are met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand they'll give you five free travel\npacks that make it really easy to mix\nup Athletic Greens while you're on the\nroad, in the car, on the plane, etc.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of Vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year supply of Vitamin D3K2.\nOded Rechavi: Yeah,\nokay, forget about that.\nWe also had the Lysenko episode.\nThat's a very big thing.\nAnd then in the US, there was the\nresearcher named McConnell, who\ndid very different experiments.\nAnd he was also a character.\nSo he was the joker type of thing.\nAnd he published many of his results\nin a journal that he published\nthat was called Worms Breeders\nGazette and had many cartoons.\nAndrew Huberman: And so he\nstarted his own journal.\nYes, that's one way to publish a lot.\nOded Rechavi: But he also published in\nvery respected journals in parallel.\nHe was a psychologist, an American\npsychologist, and he worked on\na worm, which is a flatworm,\nwhich is called Planaria.\nThis is very interesting.\nThis is different from what we'll\ndiscuss today, a different type of worm.\nYou know, worms are very common.\nSo four out of five animals\non this planet is a worm.\nAndrew Huberman: Really?\nOded Rechavi: Yes, numerically,\nif you just count the individuals.\nSo we are the exception.\nBut I'll talk about a\nvery different worm later.\nThis is a flatworm.\nThis is called planaria, and\nit is remarkable in many ways.\nIt was also a model that many\npeople worked on, including the\nfathers of genetics, that people\nwho started genetics, like Morgan,\nthey worked on it in the beginning.\nBut it's very, very hard to study\ngenetics in this worm, because\nunlike us, unlike what we explained\nbefore about how we all develop from\nsperm and egg, these worms most of\nthe time reproduce just by fission.\nThey tear themselves apart.\nSo they have a head and a tail.\nAnd the part of the head will\njust tear itself apart from\nthe tail, grow a new one.\nThe head will grow a new tail,\nthe tail will grow a new head.\nYou can even cut them into 200 pieces.\nEach piece will grow into a new worm.\nAndrew Huberman: Wow!\nOded Rechavi: And they have centralized\nbrains with lobes and everything,\nand even these degenerate eyes.\nHe studied these worms and he said\nthat he can teach them certain things,\nassociations, by pairing them all, I\ndon't remember exactly what he did.\nI think it was either lights or\nelectricity to shock them, which\nshocked them with other things.\nAnd he could train them to learn\nand remember particular things.\nAndrew Huberman: Like they might\nget shocked on one side of the tank.\nOded Rechavi: Exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: And then\navoid that side of the tank.\nOded Rechavi: Yes.\nAndrew Huberman: And then I guess\nthe question is whether or not\ntheir ripped apart selves and their\nsubsequent generations will know to\navoid that side of the tank without\nhaving ever been exposed to the shock.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nSo without ever being exposed to the\nshock or whether the new generation, the\nnew head will be able to learn faster.\nThat's another.\nThe subtlety that might happen.\nOkay.\nAnd this is what he said happened.\nHe said he can teach them certain\nthings, remove, cut off their heads and\nnew heads with all the brain will grow\nand that it will contain the memory.\nThis was the start of the controversy.\nNot the end of it, only the beginning.\nThen he said something even much\nwilder, which is he can train them\nto learn certain things and then\njust chop them up, put them in a\nblender and feed them to other worms.\nBecause they are cannibalistic, they\neat each other and that the memory\nwill transfer through feeding.\nAndrew Huberman: This sounds\nlike such a dramatic field.\nOded Rechavi: And by the\nway, this opened the field.\nSo people did experiments not only in\nplanaria, but in goldfish and certain\nrodents, and did these memory brain\ntransfer assays, implanting brain.\nAnd this is back when they had an\nidea that some memories could be\nmolecular, could have a molecular\nform, which is very appealing.\nIt's almost like science fiction.\nYou can have a memory in a tube, unlike\nthe way we think about memory normally,\nwhich is something that is distributed\nin neuronal circuits and encoded in the\nstrength of particular synapses and so on.\nBut the idea that you can take a memory\nand reduce it into a molecule and transfer\nit around is very, very interesting.\nSo this is why it\nattracted so many people.\nThis ended up in a catastrophe.\nSo there was an NIH investigation.\nNo one could replicate anything.\nIt was a big mess, although there\nwere always scientists who said,\nyes, we can replicate this and this.\nSo they were in the background.\nThe McConnell stuff was different.\nAgain, people thought that there\nare problems replicating, but it\nwasn't necessarily, but some people\nreplicate, but it wasn't necessarily\nabout replicating the whole thing.\nBut the question was the memory, the\ntransfer, specific, or is it an overall\nsensitization that transmits and so on?\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nLike you could imagine that what gets\ntransmitted is a hypersensitivity\nto electricity, as opposed to\nthe specific location that the\nelectricity was introduced.\nOded Rechavi: Or even more than\nthat, even just a hypersensitivity.\nIn general, you're more vigilant\nand you'll learn anything faster.\nThat's also a possibility.\nBut his problem wasn't the accusation.\nIt was much worse that he was\ntargeted by the Unabomber, this\nterrorist who sent letters with bombs\nto many scientists for 15 years.\nAnd his assistant, again it is\nthe assistant, I think, exploded.\nAnd this is how his line of research\nended just recently, a few years ago, a\nresearcher from Boston, Mike Levin, and\nhis postdoc, [inaudible] , replicated\nsome of McConnell's experiment with\nthe cutting of the head, but using very\nfancy equipment and automated tracking.\nAnd they could say that they can\nreplicate some of his experiments.\nAndrew Huberman: Really?\nAnd they don't open\npackages in that laboratory.\nOded Rechavi: [LAUGHS] They\nhave interesting stories.\nYou should have Mike over.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, I'm\nfamiliar with a bit of his work.\nI didn't realize they\nhad done that experiment.\nOded Rechavi: They published\nit a few years ago.\nAnd this is very interesting, but of\ncourse, they don't know how it happens.\nThe mechanism is unclear.\nMcConnell went a step further than\nthis, and what's fascinating is\nthat these are experiments that\nwere done in the 70s and 80s.\nHe said that he can not only transfer\nthe memories through chopped animals, but\nhe can take the animals that learned and\nbreak it down into different fractions.\nSo just the DNA, just the RNA, just\nthe fats, the proteins, the sugars.\nAnd he said that the fraction that\ntransmits the memory is the RNA.\nAnd this is very, very interesting\nbecause it was a long time before\neverything that we know about RNA today.\nI'll soon go into my research, explain\nwhat we do, and then you'll see that\nyou can actually feed worms with\nRNA and have many things happen.\nThis is, everyone knows this is true.\nOkay, so this is why it was so appealing\nto go back to that and study it.\nBy the way, at the time it\nbecame popular knowledge.\nEveryone knew these experiments.\nThere's a Star Trek\nepisode about it from '84.\nThere are comics, books\nabout it, books about it.\nAnd people were eating RNA because they\nthought that there was RNA in memory.\nThis was, of course, complete\nnonsense, but it made a lot of\nnoise in these years, which is\npart of the reason it was so toxic.\nUntil recently, you couldn't\ntouch it because it was considered\npseudoscience, like Lysenko,\nlike Kammerer, and all of this.\nSo this was just something you\ndidn't want to touch at all.\nAnd then we go back to these studies\nabout inheritance of memory or\ninheritance of acquired traits in\nother organisms, in mammals, in humans.\nAnd aside from the dark cloud that\nthese episodes left, there were also\ntheoretical problems of why this\ncan't happen, barriers that have\nto be breached for this to happen.\nAnd you can talk about many different\ntypes of barriers, and you can also\nnarrow it down to two main barriers.\nFirst barrier, we mentioned it.\nThis is the separation of\nthe soma from the germline.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nThe somatic cells, they can\nchange in response to experience.\nThe sperm and the egg, the\nso-called germ cells cannot.\nThat's the idea.\nOded Rechavi: Or they are isolated\nfrom what happens in the soma.\nOkay.\nThe man who first thought about this\nbarrier is called Wiseman, August Wiseman.\nThis was in the 19th century, so it\nis called today the Wiseman Barrier,\nseparation of the soma from the germline.\nOnly the germline transmits\ninformation to the next generation.\nAnd this is also called\nthe second law of biology.\nSo this is very, very fundamental.\nSo natural selection is the first\none, this is the second one,\nbecause it's so important to how\nwe work, to how our bodies work.\nWiseman, by the way, thought that\nif you will have direct influence\nof the environment on the germ\ncells, then perhaps this could\ntransfer to the next generation.\nSo he wasn't as strict\nas his barriers suggest.\nBut this is not how\nmost people remember it.\nBut he thought that this was unnecessary.\nIt's possible that natural\nselection can explain everything.\nAnd he compared it to a boat,\nwhich is in the ocean, it is\nsailing and it has a sail open.\nSo you don't have to assume\nthat it has an engine.\nThe wind is blowing.\nYou don't have to assume other things.\nThe natural selection might be enough.\nSo this barrier is still\nstanding, but not entirely.\nIt is breached in some organisms.\nWe'll go into that in a second.\nThe other barrier is now we have\nto understand the other barrier.\nWe have to talk about epigenetics.\nWe have to define\nepigenetics and what it is.\nAnd epigenetics is another term\nwhich people misuse horribly and say\nabout everything that is epigenetics.\nEven people from the fields.\nThe word itself, that the\nterm was defined in the 40s by\nWeddington, Conrad Weddington.\nAnd he talked about the interactions\nbetween genes and their products\nthat, in the end, bring about the\nphenotype of the consequences and\nhow genes influence development.\nLater, people discovered mechanisms\nthat change the action of genes.\nThere are different mechanisms and started\ntalking about these as epigenetics.\nFor example, DNA is built\nout of four basic elements.\nThese are the A,T, G, and C, and\nthey can be chemically modified.\nSo in addition to just the information\nthat you have in the sequence of the\nDNA, you also have the information\nin the modification of the bases.\nThe most common modification that\nhas been studied more than others is\nmodification of the letter C of cytosine\nmethylation, the addition of a metal group\nto this C, and this can be replicated.\nSo after the cells divide and replicate\ntheir genetic material, in certain cases\nalso, these chemical modifications can be\nadded on and replicate and be preserved.\nAndrew Huberman: For those who\naren't as familiar with thinking\nabout genes and gene structure and\nepigenetics, could we think of these?\nYou mentioned the four nucleotide bases,\nC, G, A, T, but could we imagine that\nthrough things like methylation, it's\nsort of like taking the primary colors\nand changing one of them a little\nbit, changing the hue just slightly,\nwhich then opens up an enormous number\nof new options of color integration.\nOded Rechavi: It's just more\ncombinations, more ways, more information.\nThere are the modifications of the DNA,\nand also there are the modifications\nof the proteins which condense\nthe DNA that are called histones.\nSo they are also modified\nby many different chemicals.\nAgain, methylation is a\nvery common modification.\nAcetylation, even serotonin,\nserotoninlation of histones.\nAndrew Huberman: Serotonin, right.\nOded Rechavi: This is a\nnew paper from nature.\nAndrew Huberman: From a\nfew years ago, can change.\nOded Rechavi: DNA, not the DNA\nitself, but the protein that\ncondenses it, essentially.\nAndrew Huberman: How, in the analogy\nI used before, of how the thread is\nwrapped around the spool, essentially?\nOded Rechavi: Yes, a nd this determines\nthe degree of condensation of the\nDNA, whether the gene is now more or\nless accessible, and therefore can\nperhaps be expressed more or less.\nThis is one way to affect\nthe gene expression and bring\nabout the function of the gene.\nThere are many additional\nways, not the only one.\nSo then, when all of this was starting\nto be elucidated, people talked\nabout epigenetics, they started\ntalking about these modifications,\nforgot the original definition.\nAnd when people said epigenetics,\nthey talk about methylation\nand things like that.\nAndrew Huberman: And again, to just\nframe this up so we could imagine two\nidentical twins, so called monozygotic\ntwins, we could go a step further and\nsay that they're monochorionic and they\nwere in the same placental sac, because\ntwins can be raised in separate Sacs,\nslightly different early environments.\nLet's say those two twins\nare raised separately.\nOne experiences certain things, the other\nthings, they eat different foods, etc.\nAnd there is the possibility, through\nepigenetic mechanisms, that through\nmethylation, acetylation, serotonin\nproduction, etc., that the expression of\ncertain genes in one of the twins could be\namplified relative to the other, correct?\nOded Rechavi: Yeah.\nSo we know that even totally\nidentical twins, genetically,\nthey're identical, but they look\ndifferent, and they are different.\nWe all experience it.\nAnd this can happen because of these\nepigenetic changes, or it can happen\nbecause of other mechanisms, because\ngenes respond to the environment.\nGenes don't exist in a vacuum.\nGenes need to be activated by\ntranscription factors, and there's a\nlot of machinery that is responsible\nfor making genes function.\nSo we are a combination of our\ngenetic material and the environment.\nSo when people talk about epigenetics\nand talk just about the modification,\nthey're also not exactly right.\nMy definition of epigenetics is\ninheritance, which occurs either across\ncell division or more interestingly, also\nfor this podcast, now across generations,\nnot because of changes to the DNA\nsequence, but through other mechanisms.\nI think this is the most robust\ndefinition that allows you to\nunderstand what you're talking about.\nAnd then the question is, if this happens,\nthen what are the molecules that actually\ntransmit information across generations?\nAre they these chemical\nmodifications to the DNA or to the\nproteins that condense the DNA?\nOr are there other agents that\ntransmit the information and\nwhich molecules can do it?\nAnd I actually think that\nthe most interesting players\ntoday are RNA molecules.\nBut before I go into that, I just want\nto say that when we talk about the\nbarriers to epigenetic inheritance or\nthe barriers to inheritance of acquired\ntraits, in addition to the separation\nof the soma from the germline that\nwe discussed, the other main barrier,\nit's called epigenetic reprogramming,\nwhich is that we acquired our cells.\nThe genetic material in our cells acquires\nall kinds of changes, these chemical\nchanges, modifications we discussed.\nBut these modifications are largely erased\nin the transition between generations.\nSo, in the germline, in the sperm and\nthe egg, and also in the early embryo,\nmost of the modifications are removed.\nSo we can start a blank slate\nbased on the genetic instructions.\nAnd this is crucial.\nOtherwise, according to the theory, it's\nnot clear that's actually true, because in\nsome organisms it doesn't really happen.\nWe will not develop according to the\nspecies typical genetic instructions.\nSo to preserve this, we erase all\nthese modifications and start anew.\nAnd this is in mammals and in\nhumans, this is largely true.\nMost of the modifications in the\nsperm and in the egg are removed.\nSo about 90% of them, some remain,\nwhich could be interesting.\nAndrew Huberman: So the idea, if I\nunderstand correctly, is that there's\nsome advantage to wiping the slate clean\nand returning to the original plan.\nIn the context of the IKEA\nfurniture analogy, the instruction\nbook is the one that's issued to\neverybody or every cell, right?\nOnly certain instructions are used for\ncertain cells, say a skin cell or a neuron\nor a liver cell or any other cell for\nthat matter, through the course of the\nlifespan of the organism, those specific\ninstructions are adjusted somewhat.\nOkay, so maybe like IKEA furniture,\nsometimes they sent you seven, not eight,\nof particular screws, or they sent you\nthe proper number, but you put them in\nthe wrong place and it sort of changes the\nway that the thing works a little bit once\nthat, assuming furniture could reproduce.\nBut here in the analogy of the\nfurniture as the cell or the organ\nin it mates with another organism\nthat needs to be replicated.\nAnd so the idea is to take the\ninstruction, but go through and erase\nall the pen and pencil marks, erase all\nthose additional little modifications that\nthe owner used or introduced to it, and\nreturn to the original instruction, right?\nOded Rechavi: Because if you want\nto bring back the instruction\nbook, you want it to have all the\npotential to make all the furniture.\nYou don't want it to be restricted to the\nones that you made in a particular room.\nAndrew Huberman: So it's essentially\nthe opposite of acquired traits\nand characteristics, based on\nwhat we say in biology, geek\nspeak, lineage based experience.\nBut what your parents experience.\nRight.\nIn some ways, we want to\neliminate all that and go back\nto just the genes they provided.\nOded Rechavi: Yes, but\nit's more complicated.\nIt's more complicated than that\nbecause we have some very striking\nexamples, even in mammals, where\nsome of the marks are maintained.\nFor example, the classic\nexample is imprinting.\nImprinting is a very\ninteresting phenomenon.\nThe way DNA works is that you inherit\na copy for every chromosome from your\nmother and your father, and then you have\nin every cell of your body, two copies,\nif you're a human, of every chromosome.\nSo every gene is represented twice.\nThese are called alleles, the\ndifferent versions of the genes.\nAnd the thought is that, in the\nnext generation, the two copies\nthat you inherited are equal.\nIt doesn't matter whether you acquire\nthem from your mother or from your father.\nThere are some situations\nwhere it does matter.\nThere is a limited number of genes\nthat are called imprinted genes, where\nit does matter whether you inherited\nfrom your mother or your father.\nAnd this is happening through epigenetic\ninheritance, not because of changes\nto the DNA sequence, but because\nof maintenance of these chemical\nmodifications across generations.\nAndrew Huberman: And as I recall from\nthe beautiful work of Catherine Dulac\nat Harvard, that, especially in the\nbrain, there is evidence that some\ncells contain the complete genome from\nmom or the complete genome from dad.\nOded Rechavi: And it can\nalso switch during your life.\nSo her work showed that early on in\nyour life, it's different whether\nyou express the maternal or paternal\ncopy than when you're more mature.\nAndrew Huberman: So parents\nand children take note.\nFor those of you that are saying, oh,\nthe child is more like you or more like\nme, that can change across the lifespan.\nAnd if you're thinking about your\nparental lineage and wondering\nwhether or not you \"inherited\" some\nsort of trait from mother or from\nfather, it can be, of course, both.\nOr it can be just one or just\nthe other, which I think most\nparents tend to see and describe in\ntheir children from time to time.\nThat's just like the father, or that's\njust like the mother, for instance.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nBut it's important to know that in this\nsituation, the environment played no role.\nThis was just whether it passed\nto the mother or the father.\nIt's not that something that happened to\nthe mother or the father affected this.\nSo this is slightly different.\nThe question is now, can the environment\nchange the heritable material?\nSo it's very important to understand\nthat there is a difference\nbetween nurture and nature.\nAnd this is very confusing,\nand people are confused.\nIt's a little subtle.\nSo, for example, people tell\nme, I'm growing horses for many\nyears, and I just know that this\nhorse has a particular character.\nIt's very different\nfrom the other horsess.\nAnd so this is epigenetic inheritance?\nNo, it could be just\ngenetically determined.\nYes.\nThis horse inherited a different\nset of genetic instructions.\nSo it is different.\nDoesn't have to be about epigenetics.\nEpigenetic inheritance means that\nthe environment of the parents\nsomehow change the children.\nAnd there are these two main barriers\nthat are serious bottlenecks that\nwe have to think about what type of\nmolecule and how they can be breached.\nSo one possibility is that it's\nreally this limited number of\nchemical modifications that\nsurvive, which is about 10% or so.\nThat could be very interesting.\nAndrew Huberman: Not a small number?\nOded Rechavi: Not a small number.\nBut perhaps.\nPerhaps.\nOkay, this is one possibility.\nThe other possibility is that\nthere are other mechanisms.\nThe situation now in humans is that it's\njust really unclear what transmits, if it\ncan transmit, and which molecule does it.\nWe'll talk later about other organisms\nwhere it is a lot more clear.\nBut in humans and in mammals in\ngeneral, there are many examples of\nenvironments that change the children.\nWhether you need to invoke an\nepigenetic mechanism to explain\nthis phenomena, this is unclear.\nFirst of all, because it's\nhard to separate nature from\nnurture, and second, because the\nmechanism is just not understood.\nSo there are classic examples for humans,\nthere were periods of famine, starvation\nin different places in the world.\nIn the Netherlands, in China,\nin Russia, where people did huge\nepidemiological study to study the next\ngenerations and saw that the children\nof women who were starved during\npregnancy are different in many ways.\nThey have different birth weight,\nglucose sensitivity, and also some\nneurological, higher chances of\ngetting some neurological diseases.\nAnd this has been shown\nin very large studies.\nAndrew Huberman: Is there ever an\ninstance in which starvation or\nhardship of some kind, some challenge,\nsensory challenge or survival based\nchallenge led to adaptive traits?\nOded Rechavi: Yes, there are.\nIn different organisms, it could\nbe as a result of a trade off.\nSo there could be a downside as well.\nBut, for example, there are two\nexamples that come into mind.\nOne of them is that if you stress\nmale mice or rats, I don't remember.\nThis is the work of Isabel\nMansuy in the ETH in Switzerland.\nIf you stress the males, you can\ndo it in many different ways.\nI don't remember exactly how they\ndid, but you can separate them\nfrom their mothers, you can do\nsocial defeat, all kinds of things.\nThen the next generations are less\nstressed, they show less anxiety.\nAndrew Huberman: So the\nthreshold for stress is higher?\nOded Rechavi: Yes.\nHowever, I think they have memory\ndeficits and other metabolic problems.\nAndrew Huberman: Which may be a n\nadvantage for dealing with stress.\nOded Rechavi: Could be.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't have\nany direct evidence of that.\nBut there's some simmering ideas that\nour ability to anchor our thoughts\nin the past, present or future seems\nvery adaptive in certain contexts.\nIn other contexts, it can keep\nus ruminating and not adaptively\npresent to our current challenges.\nOded Rechavi: Another example\nis that of nicotine exposure.\nThis is, I think, the work of Oliver\nRando from UMass, if I'm not mistaken.\nThese are not my studies, but they\nimprove the tolerance to exposure to\nsimilar drugs in the next generation.\nThe interesting thing here is\nthat it's very non-specific.\nSo you treat them with nicotine,\nbut then in the next generation they\nare more tolerant to nicotine, but\nalso to others, I think cocaine.\nAndrew Huberman: That sort of makes\nsense to me, because obviously nicotine\nactivates the cholinergic system, the\ndopaminergic system, epinephrine, etc.\nAnd you can imagine that there's\ncrossover because other drugs\nlike cocaine, amphetamine, mainly\ntarget the catecholamines, the\ndopamine and norepinephrine.\nOded Rechavi: In this particular\nstudy, if I remember correctly, they\nshow that this happens, this heritable\neffect, even if you use an antagonist\nto block the nicotine receptor.\nAndrew Huberman: Wow.\nOded Rechavi: So it's something\nmore about clearance of xenobiotics\nand hepatic functions that is\ntransmitted and is very nonspecific.\nAndrew Huberman: What I love about\nall the examples you've given today,\nespecially that one, is, and I hope that\npeople, if you're just listening, I'm\nsmiling, because biology is so cryptic\nsometimes the obvious mechanism is\nrarely the one that's actually at play.\nAnd people always ask,\nwell, why is it like this?\nAnd I always say, the one thing\nI know for sure is that I wasn't\nconsulted at the design phase.\nAnd if anyone claims they were, then you\ndefinitely want to back away very fast.\nOded Rechavi: And there\ncould be so many trade offs.\nSo many trade offs.\nSo, for example, we studied, and also\nmany other people studied effects.\nThese are in worms.\nWe'll go deep into that in a second.\nBut that shows that when you starve\nthem, the next generations live longer.\nAnd this, I think, could be a trade\noff with other things like fertility.\nSo the next generations are\nmore sick and less fertile.\nAnd perhaps because of\nthat they live longer.\nSo it's not necessarily a good thing.\nAndrew Huberman: I don't want to\ndraw you off course, because this\nis magnificent, what you're doing\nand splaying out for us here.\nBut do you recall there was a few years\nago, it actually ended very tragically.\nIt was an example, I think it\nwas, down in San Diego county,\nthere was a cult of sorts that\nwere interested in living forever.\nAnd so the males castrated themselves\nin the idea that somehow maintaining\nsome pre-pubescent state or reverting\nto a pseudo pre-pubescent state\nwould somehow extend longevity.\nThe idea that sexual behavior\nsomehow limited lifespan.\nThis has been an idea that's\nbeen thrown around in the kind of\nmore wacky longevity communities.\nThey also shaved their heads.\nThey also all wore the same sneakers.\nBut then they also all committed\nsuicide, right, as the Halle-Bopp\ncomet came through town.\nBut that's just, but one example\nof many cults aimed at sort of that\nobviously was not life extension,\nthat was life truncation, but aimed\nat a kind of eternal life or some\nsort of through caloric restriction.\nThat's right, this cult also was very\ninto the whole idea that through caloric\nrestriction, we can live much longer,\nwhich may actually turn out to be true.\nI think it's still debated, hence all the\ndebate about intermittent fasting, etc.\nBut also it is known that if\nyou overeat, you shorten life.\nThis is clear.\nIt's known that big bodied members\nof a species live far shorter lives\nthan the smaller members of a great\nDane versus a Chihuahua, for instance.\nSo there is some sort of, shard\nof truths in all of these things.\nBut it seems to me that the real question\nis, what is the real mechanism and\nwhy would something like this exist?\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: And why?\nQuestions are very dangerous in biology.\nOded Rechavi: Right, right.\nBut very interesting also, when it comes\nto metabolic changes and nutrition,\nthere are numerous examples where\nyou either overfeed or starve and\nget effects in the next generations.\nSometimes the effects contrast\ndepending on the way you do this.\nAgain, we don't do any of that in\nmammals, but people show that starving\nor overfeeding the mothers or the\nfathers changes the body weight of the\nnext generation and also the glucose\ntolerance and also reproductive success.\nAnd so the fact that there's an effect\nthat something transmits, this is clear.\nThe question is, how miraculous is it?\nAnd whether you need new biology\nand epigenetics to explain it.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nIf you affect the next generation,\nit doesn't necessarily have to go\nthrough the oöcyte or the sperm, and\ninvolves the epigenome, you change the\nmetabolism of the animal as it develops,\nand obviously it will affect it.\nWhen you, for example, starve women\nthat are pregnant, as happened during\nthe famous starvation studies, the\nbaby is already in utero, exposed\ndirectly to the environment.\nSo it's not even a heritable effect.\nThe baby is itself affected.\nIt's a direct effect, very interesting,\nimportant, and has many implications.\nAnd it will be separate from the genetics.\nYou'll have to take it into account\nto understand what's going on.\nDoesn't require, necessarily, a new\nbiology, a new biology of inheritance.\nNot only is the embryo affected, the\nembryo, while in utero, already has\ngerm cells, so it's also the next\ngeneration, so is directly exposed.\nAnd you don't need any new biology\nnecessarily, to explain it.\nAnd it doesn't have to involve genetic\nepigenetics or epigenetic gender.\nAndrew Huberman: It's clear to\nme that in the female fetus, the\ntotal number of eggs that she will\nsomeday produce and potentially\nhave fertilized by sperm exist.\nBut in males with a 60 day sperm cycle\nleads me to the question, do fetal\nmales, males as fetuses, living as\nfetuses in their moms, already start\nproducing sperm, or it's the primordial\ncells that give rise to sperm.\nOded Rechavi: So I'm not an expert,\nso I don't want to go into the details\nof exactly when in mammals but yes,\nexposure of the mother also has an affect,\neventually the transmission of genetic\ninformation through the sperm's father.\nAnd there are also many examples of just\nstressing the fathers, affecting their\nsperm and affecting the next generation.\nThere.\nIf you go to the F2 generation, if you\ngo two generations down the road, not\nto the kids, but to the grandkids, then\nit is a real epigenetic effect, because\nyou examine something that happens,\nalthough the next generation was never\nexposed to the original challenge.\nSo when we say about epigenetic\ninheritance through the paternal\nlineage, through the fathers,\nwe talk about two generations.\nAnd when you go through the mother,\nit's three generations to talk\nabout when you need to invoke\nsome real epigenetic mechanism.\nAnd there the evidence becomes\nmuch more scarce in mammals.\nThere are examples,\nmore or less convincing.\nThe field is evolving and improving a lot.\nSo, for example, now many people use,\nthe cutting edge is to use IVF, in-vitro\nfertilization, or transfer of embryos, to\nmake sure that actually it's the heritable\ninformation and not the environment,\nand that it goes through the germline.\nSo this is something\nthat is being done now.\nThere are studies.\nAndrew Huberman: You're talking about\nthe three parent IVF, where they\ntake the DNA from mom, the sperm from\ndad, and they take the DNA from mom\nand put it into a novel cytoplasm?\nOded Rechavi: No, not at all.\nYou just take the sperm and\ntransfer it and fertilize an egg.\nAndrew Huberman: So standard IVF?\nOded Rechavi: Yeah, standard IVF.\nYou can do it in many different ways.\nBut this idea that you separate\nthe environment of the mother from\nthe inheritance or the environment\nof the father, and to control\nand separate nature from nurture.\nAndrew Huberman: The environment\nbecomes the culture dish.\nOded Rechavi: Yes, so\nthe field is improving.\nPeople do experiments that have\na higher end, so more replicate\nand are better controlled.\nAnd there are some examples\nfor effects that transfer.\nAnd it depends who you ask\nwhether people believe it or not.\nMany geneticists do not believe in\nit, and many people do believe it,\nand it depends on the community.\nThere is strong resistance\nfor many reasons.\nSome of them are justified, some are\nless justified and are part of the\nscientific process and how things work,\nbecause it's challenging the dogma.\nSo this is very interesting on its own.\nIf you ask psychologists, many\npsychologists believe that there's\nheritable trauma and things like\nthat, population geneticists less.\nSo this really depends, and I\nthink that we are just at a point\nin time where we don't really know\nwhether it happens and to what\nextent, and we need bigger studies.\nEven if you think about normal,\njust genetic studies, where people\na trying to understand the genetic\nunderpinning of complex traits, like\nanything that involves the brain,\npretty much, we now know that you\nneed to study many, many people.\nSo now these big genome wide association\nstudies, big genetic studies, involve\nhundreds of thousands of people.\nNo one did an experiment\nlike this for epigenetics.\nIt's much more complicated\nbecause you need to also take\ninto account the environment.\nI'm not even sure we know how\nto design such an experiment.\nIt's very, very challenging.\nPart of the resistance to the idea\nis based on theoretical grounds\nbecause of these barriers and\nbecause of the controversies.\nOn the other hand, people\nreally want to believe it.\nPeople really want to believe it because\nit sort of gives your life meaning if you\ncan change your biology through changing\nyour kids, through changing your biology.\nSo psychologically, I can understand\nwhy many people want this to happen.\nEven Schrodinger, the famous physicist,\nso he wrote a very important book in\n'44, so this was before the double helix,\nand it's called What is Life ? This\nis actually a book that drove many\nphysicists to establish molecular biology.\nIt's very, very important and he\ntalks about the heritable material.\nIt also talks about evolution.\nAnd he said, unfortunately, Lamarckism\nor inheritance of acquired traits\nis untenable, it doesn't happen.\nAnd he writes, this is very, very\nsad or unfortunate because unlike\nDarwinism or natural selection, which\nis gloomy, it doesn't matter what you\ndo, the next generation will be born\nbased on the instruction in the sperm\nand the egg, you can't influence it.\nOf course, you can give your\nkids money and education, but you\ncan't biologically influence it.\nAndrew Huberman: One thing I'm\nfascinated by for a number of\nreasons, is partner selection.\nI mean, in some ways we think, oh,\nwe want to find someone who is kind.\nThat does seem to be, by the\nway, the primary feature, at\nleast in what the data tell us.\nWe had David Buss on the podcast of how\nwomen select men, that people are kind.\nThere's also resource potential.\nThere's also beauty or aesthetic\nattractiveness in males and females, etc.\nMale, male, female,\nfemale, as the case may be.\nBut in terms of reproduction,\nsperm, egg, male female, obviously.\nSo we're selecting for a number of traits,\nbut presumably subconsciously, we are\nalso selecting for a number of traits\nrelated to vigor and in the idea that if\nwe were to have offspring with somebody,\nthat those traits would be selected for.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAnd we actually have work on that\nin nematodes that I'll be happy to\ntell you about in a second after we--\nAndrew Huberman: --The dating in worms--\n-- Oded Rechavi: The dating in worms , where\nwe understand the mechanism, and we'll\ngo into that in a second or in a few\nminutes after we dive into the worms.\nBut yes, the original calculations\nof how population genetics work to\nsimplify things and to do the math, so\nit will be easy, it was random mating.\nOf course, it doesn't work like that.\nSo it complicates things because\nwe know, and there's research\nabout potential capacity to\nsomehow sense immune compatibility\nand things like this, which is.\nI don't know, I'm not an expert on that.\nAndrew Huberman: Neither am I, b ut my\nunderstanding is that, of course, we're\nfamiliar with the other traits we select\nfor, like potential nurturing ability.\nWhether or not someone is\nreliable predicts something\nabout their nurturing ability.\nAnd for offspring, potentially.\nI mean, you can draw lines between these\nthings without any direct evidence,\nbut they seem so logical, right?\nThat somebody kind might also stick\naround or be honest and these kinds\nof things, that it makes sense.\nBut that one would be selecting\nfor certain biological traits like\nimmune function or some other form of\nrobustness that we're not aware of is,\nI think, a fascinating area of biology.\nOded Rechavi: So this is where\nthe work in mammals stands.\nHowever, there's also one additional\nthing to mention, which is that on\ntop of chemical modifications to the\nDNA and the proteins that condense\nthe DNA, which are called histones,\nthere are also other mechanisms that\nmight transmit information, including\ntransmission between generations of RNA.\nAnd there are different types of RNA, not\njust the RNA that we mentioned before,\nthe messenger RNA, which encodes the\ninformation for making proteins, but also\nother RNAs that regulate gene expression.\nAnd this is, and I think that in\nrecent years, also in the mammalian\nfield, RNA as the molecule that has\nthe potential to transmit information\nbetween generations, took center stage.\nSo I think this is the cutting edge,\na lot more to understand and know.\nBut RNA has a lot of potential for\ndoing that, as we'll explain soon.\nBut we have to go to worms first.\nAndrew Huberman: I'd like to take just\ntake a brief moment and thank one of our\npodcast sponsors, which is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes\ndata from your blood and DNA to help\nyou better understand your body and\nhelp you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in getting\nregular blood work done for the simple\nreason that blood work is the only way\nthat you can monitor the markers such\nas hormone markers, lipids, metabolic\nfactors, et cetera, that impact\nyour immediate and long-term health.\nOne major challenge with blood work,\nhowever, is that most of the time it does\nnot come back with any information about\nwhat to do in order to move the values\nfor hormones, metabolic factors, lipids,\net cetera, into the ranges that you want.\nWith InsideTracker, changing those\nvalues becomes very straightforward\nbecause it has a personalized\ndashboard that you can use to address\nthe nutrition-based, behavior-based,\nsupplement-based approaches that you\ncan use in order to move those values\ninto the ranges that are optimal for\nyou, your vitality, and your longevity.\nInsideTracker now includes a\nmeasurement of apolipoprotein B,\nso-called APOB, in their ultimate plan.\nAPOB is a key marker of cardiovascular\nhealth, and therefore there's extreme\nvalue to knowing your APOB levels.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker, you\ncan go to insidetracker.com/huberman to\nget 20% off any of InsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nThank you for that incredible overview\nof genetics and RNA and epigenetics,\nand it was essentially a survey of\nthis very interesting and on the\nface of a complex field, but you've\nsimplified it a great deal for us.\nIn our transition to talking about worms.\nI would like to plant a flag in the\nHuberman Lab podcast and say that what\nwe are about to discuss is the first\ntime that anyone on this podcast has\ndiscussed so called model organisms.\nI may have mentioned a fly paper here\nor there, or a study on honeybees and\ncaffeine and flower preference at one\npoint, but typically that's done in\npassing, and we quickly rotate to humans.\nI know that many, if not most, of our\nlisteners are focused on humans and\nhuman biology and health, etc., but I\ncannot emphasize enough the importance\nof model organisms and the incredible\ndegree to which they've informed us\nabout human health, especially when it\ncomes to very basic functions in cells.\nI mean, one could argue, okay, and\nthere's been some debate, telomeres\nin mice, did that really lead to\nthe same sort of data in humans?\nOkay, there are those cases,\ncertainly, but model organisms are\nabsolutely critical and have been\nand basically inform most of what\nwe understand about human health.\nSo before we start to go into the\ndescription about worms per se,\ncould you just explain to a general\naudience what a model organism is?\nRight.\nThey're not modeling.\nThey're not posing for photographs,\nobviously, what that means and what\nsome of the general model organisms\nare and why you've selected or elected\nto work on a particular type of worm\nto study these fascinating topics\nthat there's zero question also\ntake place in humans at some level.\nOded Rechavi: So it's a real\npleasure and an honor to represent\nthe model organisms here.\nI'm really happy just for that.\nIt was worth it, because, as\nyou said, model organisms are\nextremely important, and we learn\nso much about biology through them.\nModel organisms mean that it's an\norganism that many people work on.\nSo there's a community of\npeople that work on them.\nPeople work, study many types of\norganisms, but not around every organism.\nThere's a huge community of researchers\nthat combine sources to create all\nthe resources, the tools and the\nunderstanding that accumulates.\nThere are just a handful of model\norganisms in the short history of the\nfield of biology, it's not so long.\nWe learned about every aspect of\nbiology through them, including many\nimportant diseases, human diseases.\nAnd these are E.\ncoli bacteria, phage - which is a virus of\nbacteria, flies, worms that are called C.\nelegans, and nematodes.\nThis is what we studied in the lab.\nFish which are called zebrafish.\nAndrew Huberman: Danio\nrerio, or something, right?\nOded Rechavi: Yeah, and of course, there\nare also model organisms, and mouse,\nand also plants, important plants.\nThe most studied one is arabidopsis.\nAndrew Huberman: And perhaps\nless so nowadays, but non-human\nprimates, macaque monkeys,\nmarmosets, squirrel monkeys, mainly.\nOded Rechavi: These, I don't know\nexactly how the definition is,\nbut emerging model organisms.\nThere are many model organisms that are\nemerging, and there are communities that\nare formed, including also around the\nplanaria that we mentioned before, this\nflatworm that regenerates, this is a\ngreat model for studying regenerations.\nIf we could develop new\nheads, it would be incredible.\nAnd we can learn from these organisms.\nAnd the reason that we can learn a\nlot also about humans by studying\nthese animals is that we all\nevolved from the same ancestor.\nSo we share a lot of our functions\nwith them and also a lot of our genes.\nC.\nelegans, and they have, the\ndifferent model organisms have\ndifferent advantages that serve us.\nThey sometimes have things that are much\nmore apparent in them that we can study.\nFor example, learning and memory\nwas largely studied in the beginning\nin a snail, aplysia, where many\nof the discoveries were made,\nbecause it has big neurons that\nyou can easily study and examine.\nAndrew Huberman: And yes, snails learn.\nOded Rechavi: Yes, they learn, even C.\nelegans, these nematodes that we\nstudy, learn, and they are much\nsimpler than another important reason\nto study them, of course, is can\nyou actually experiment on them?\nWe can't do this to humans, the\nthings that we do to these animals.\nAnd we can change their genes,\ndo all kinds of things to them.\nAndrew Huberman: And sorry to interrupt,\nbut in some cases, I think you're\ngoing to tell us, for instance, in C.\nelegans in particular, the presence\nof particular cell types is so\nstereotyped that you can look at\nseveral different worms and the\ncommunity of people that study C.\nelegans has literally numbered and named\neach neuron so that two laboratories on\nopposite sides of the world can publish\npapers on the same neuron, knowing that\nit's the same neuron in the two different\nlaboratories, something that is extremely\nhard to do in any mammalian model, a\nmouse, or certainly in humans, and has\nposed huge challenges that give great\nadvantages to studies of things like C.\nelegans.\nOded Rechavi: Yes.\nSo, C.\nelegans, this is the star now,\nand this is what we study.\nThese are nematodes, small worms,\nroundworms that are just 1 mm long, so\nyou can't see them with the naked eye.\nYou have to look under the scope.\nAndrew Huberman: Where do they\nlive in the natural world?\nOded Rechavi: So they used\nto call them soil nematodes,\nbut this is not really true.\nThey are in many places, but they are\nmostly in rotten fruits and leaves.\nAnd you can find them\nin the ground as well.\nBut you can also find them, and\nthey are free living, so they're not\nparasites, but you can sometimes also\nfind them in snails, but the best way\nto isolate them is from rotten fruits.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, I Like the\nidea that they're not parasites.\nI'm one of these people that gets a little\nsqueamish about the notion of parasites.\nOded Rechavi: Yeah, so\nthey're not parasites.\nThey're really fun to handle\nbecause they're so small and easy.\nYou just grow them on\nplates with agar and E.\nColi bacteria, this is\nwhat they eat in the lab.\nYou can just pick them with a small pick,\nwire pick, and move them around and change\ntheir genes and do many things to them.\nBut they have many advantages for\nneuroscience and for studying inheritance.\nAs you mentioned, they always have a\ncertain number of cells in the body.\nSo a silicon nematode always has\n959 cells in its body, that's it.\nAndrew Huberman: Not 960.\nNot 958.\nOded Rechavi: 959, and out of\nwhich 302 are neurons, always 302.\nThere's a huge debate now over\nTwitter on whether it's 302 or 300.\nI don't want to get into trouble, okay?\nBut people take this very hard.\nI think it's 302, but let's not get\ninto it because I'll get into trouble.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, we can equilibrate\nall things here by, you, say, 302.\nGranted, you're far more informed in this\nmodel organism than I am or ever will be.\nI'll say 300, and then we're balanced\nin terms of partisan politics in the C.\nelegans community.\nOded Rechavi: Perfect.\nAnd it's always the same.\nAnd each neuron has a name, like you said.\nAnd not only does every neuron have a\nname, many of them, we know what they do.\nSo there's a few cells that are sensory\nneurons that sense particular chemicals.\nIn certain situations, we'll\nknow that a chemical will be\nsensed just by one neuron.\nThere are other motor neurons\nand interneurons and all of that.\nWe know how many dopamine neurons\nthere are, and serotonin neurons,\nand we know them all by their name.\nNot only that, we know how they\nare connected to one another.\nWe have a map, a connectome since\nthe 80s, like a subway map that tells\nus which neuron talks with which\nother neurons, and it is the same.\nPeople thought that it was exactly the\nsame between genetically identical warms.\nNow we know that there are\nslight differences, but by\nand large, it is the same.\nAnd we have a map, a roadmap\nthat we can use to study.\nAndrew Huberman: The so-called connectome.\nOded Rechavi: The connectome.\nNot only that, the worms are\ntransparent, so we can actually see\nthe neurons fire using particular\ntools, and we can activate genes and\nsilage genes using optogenetics, like\nwas discussed here on the podcast.\nWe can make the worms go forward or\nbackward or lay an egg by shining\ndifferent waves of light on them.\nSo we have very powerful tools\nfor manipulating the brain.\nOn top of that, we have great\nunderstanding of the genetics\nof the worm, of the genome.\nThe C.\nelegans is the first animal to have\nits genome sequenced before humans.\nBefore that, of course, there\nwere bacteria, and we know that.\nAnd each worm produces, each mother\nproduces about 250 babies, which\nare almost genetically identical.\nAnd we know where we grow them.\nThe environment is very controlled,\nso we grow them in the plate with\njust bacteria, so we can easily\nseparate between nature and nurture.\nAndrew Huberman: And one thing that I\nwonder about often is generation time.\nEven though mice are not humans,\nmice have certain advantages\nbecause they're mammalian species.\nYou can't do all the magnificent\nthings that you can do in C.\nelegans and mice.\nBut one major issue with mice is that\nthe generation time is somewhat long.\nYou pair two mice, they mate.\nYou get a mouse or litter of mice.\n21 days later.\nIt might seem like, okay,\nthat's only 21 days or so.\nBut if you are a graduate student\nor postdoc, trying to do a project\nthat can extend the time to do\nexperiments out three or four years\ncompared to what you could do in C.\nelegans.\nOded Rechavi: You're absolutely right,\nt his is one of the major advantages.\nThe generation time in C.\nelegans is three days.\nThree days.\nSo you can do hundreds of\nworm generations in one PhD.\nThis is very important.\nNot only that, every worm will produce\nhundreds of progeny that are genetically\nidentical, so you will have great\nstatistics for your experiments.\nAndrew Huberman: And the worms\nprobably don't mind living on these\nagar plates munching away on E.\ncoli, where it's the good life.\nIt's questionable whether or not mice,\nor certainly, listen, I'm a proponent\nof well-controlled and as long as\nthere's oversight, animal research.\nIt's necessary for the development of\ntreatments of diseases that hinder humans.\nBut it is always a little bit of a kind of\na cringe and go kind of thing when you're\ndealing with mammals that are living so\nfar outside their natural environment.\nI'd be lying if I didn't say that it\ngets to you after a while, and if it\ndoesn't get to you, you kind of have\nto wonder about your own psyche a bit.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nI also think that this is important, but\nfor me, it's much easier to work on worms.\nI don't have to feel bad about it.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, they're happy.\nOded Rechavi: They're happy.\nIf a worm dies, it's less painful\nto the human than if other,\nmore sensitive animals do.\nAndrew Huberman: Yes, I agree.\nOded Rechavi: So there are\nmany advantages for studying C.\nelegans.\nAnd in the worm, we now have very\nobvious and clear cut proof that there\nis inheritance of acquired traits.\nSo much so that I don't think\nthat anyone pretty much in the\nepigenetic field argues against it.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, and in large part\nthanks to you and the work you've done.\nSo, could you tell us, what was the\nfirst experiment that you did on C.\nelegans that confirmed for you that\nthere is inheritance of acquired traits?\nBecause, of course, the best\nexperiments and experimenters always\nset out to disprove their hypothesis.\nAnd when the hypothesis survives, despite\nall the control experiments and poking\nand prodding and attempts to contradict\noneself, then it's considered a victory.\nBut it's one that we all have to\nbe very cautious about enjoying\nbecause of the tendency to\nwant our hypotheses to be true.\nSo what was the first experiment\nwhere you were convinced that\ninheritance of acquired traits is real?\nOded Rechavi: The first experiment I\ndid was in my postdoc, which I did with\nOliver Hubbard in University of Columbia.\nWe set out to test whether worms can\nproduce transgenerational, prolonged\nmulti-generational resistance to viruses.\nAndrew Huberman: Wow.\nThis is a very pertinent\ntopic, which is relevant.\nOded Rechavi: These worms don't have\ndedicated immune cells like we do.\nThey don't have T cells or B cells.\nThey defend themselves from\nviruses very efficiently using RNA.\nSo, in fact, when we started these\nexperiments, there wasn't any\nnatural virus that was known to\ninfect clients, which is amazing\nbecause viruses are very good, as\nwe all experience now, in infecting.\nAnd the worms are resistant to viruses\nbecause of RNA molecules, short\nRNA molecules that destroy viruses.\nAnd these are called small RNAs.\nNow, we need to discuss them\nbefore I explain my experiment.\nIn 2006, two researchers\nthat were studying C.\nelegans, Andrew Fire and Craig Mello,\ngot the Nobel Prize for showing that\nthere is a mechanism that regulates\ngenes that happens through small RNAs.\nWhat they've shown is that if you\ninject the worms with RNA molecules,\nwhich are double-stranded, they\nshut off the genes that correspond\nthat match in sequence to this RNA.\nAndrew Huberman: So it's sort of\nlike taking the specific instructions\nfor the coffee table from your IKEA\nhandbook, and you insert a copy of\nthat into the book, and in doing\nso, you prevent the expression of.\nYou sort of erase the original page.\nOded Rechavi: Perfect explanation.\nPerfect explanation.\nAnd they found that double-strand RNA,\nRNA that has two strands is what starts\nthe response leading to the production\nof small RNA molecules, which are the\nones that actually find the messenger RNA\nand lead to its destruction, silence it.\nSo you don't get proteins\nin the end for that.\nThey got the Nobel Prize after\npeople found that this is conserved\nin many organisms, including\nhumans, and there are now drugs.\nThis was only in 2006 that the Nobel\nPrize, the paper was published in 98.\nThere are now drugs that use\nthis mechanism also in humans.\nAndrew Huberman: And I'll just\ninterject and say that not only is it\na recent discovery and an incredibly\nimportant one, but Andy Fire and Craig\nMello are also really nice people.\nYeah, they just happen\nto be very nice people.\nAnd Craig Mello is an excellent,\nI think he's a kite surfer.\nThe only time I met him in person was\nat a meeting, and he had a black eye,\nand I thought, okay, wow, I guess he's\nalso a pugilist or something, but turns\nout he had done that kite surfing.\nSo scientists actually do things\nother than go to the laboratory.\nNobel Prize winning scientists, that is.\nOkay, I'll let you continue.\nThanks for allowing that.\nOded Rechavi: Incredible scientist.\nAnd there were also studies\nin many organisms on the\nmechanisms of how this happens.\nIt is called RNA interference.\nRNA interferes in the expression of a\ngene, in the function of a gene, and it's\nalso called gene silencing, because these\nRNAs enforce the silencing of genes.\nInstead of the genes being\nexpressed, they are silenced, and\nyou don't manifest their function.\nAlready in the first paper that they\npublished about this, where they've\nshown that double-strand RNA is what\nleads to the silencing of the control.\nThey've shown two very important things.\nOne of them is that if you inject\nthe worms with double-strand RNA,\nyou don't only see the action in\nthe cell that you injected or in\nthe tissue that you injected, but\nyou see it all over the worm's body.\nIt spreads.\nIt wasn't exactly clear what spreads,\nbut it was clear that it spreads.\nYou see the silencing all over the body.\nThis includes also the germ cells.\nSo, if you inject the double-strand\nRNA just to somatic cells, even\nto the head, you will also get the\neffect in the germ cells and in the\nnext generation, in the immediate\nprogeny, the F1 generation, the kids.\nSo this was really clear\nproof that this is inherited.\nHowever, this is just one generation\nin these original studies.\nLater they've shown something which\nwill immediately remind you what I\ntold you about with planaria, that you\ncan just take worms and feed them on\nbacteria that produce this double-strand\nRNA, and that the double-strand and\nthe silencing would move from the site\nof ingestion, from the gut where the\nbacteria are eaten, to the rest of the\nbody and also to the next generation.\nSo before we left, when I mentioned\nthese cannibalistic experiments of\nMcConnell with the planaria, and\nnow you see that it can happen, and\nthis is not controversial at all.\nThis is being done routinely\nevery day by any C.\nelegans biologist in the world.\nThis has been replicated a million times.\nNot only that, you can also feed\nplanaria, these other worms with RNA.\nYou can just put it in chopped\nliver and let them eat it.\nAnd again, this will\nspread throughout the body.\nAndrew Huberman: Wild.\nOded Rechavi: And this\nis what we do routinely.\nWe always, when we want, we use\nthis technique to see what genes do.\nIf we want to see whether a particular\ngene is important for a certain behavior\nor a certain something, the way to study\nit is to neutralize the gene activity.\nAnd we do it by just introducing the worms\nwith double-strand RNA that correspond\nin sequence, that match in sequence this\ngene, this will lead to the silencing,\nthis activates the gene's activity.\nAnd if then the effect stops, we know\nthis gene is involved in the function.\nAnd we never want to just examine\none worm, so we feed the mother\nwith double-strand RNA and then we\nexamine all of its children, so we\ncan have the statistics over hundreds\nof worms or thousands of worms.\nSo this is validated and not\ncontroversial at all and totally routine.\nAndrew Huberman: Is it fair to say that\nMcConnell's experiments of chop-blending\nup these worms - [LAUGHS] very graphic\nimage - blending up these worms and\nthen feeding them to other worms,\nplanaria, that those experiments can,\nyes, be explained by double-stranded\nRNA and through RNA interference?\nOded Rechavi: Potentially.\nIt hasn't been done yet.\nWe are working on it in my lab\nnow in collaboration with other\nlabs, but it wasn't published.\nBut yes, this could be the explanation.\nSo Fire and Mello did these experiments,\nsome other people did these experiments.\nWhen I started my work, I wanted\nto see whether, in addition to\nartificial double-strand RNA, some\nnatural traits can also transmit\nacross generations because of RNA.\nBecause of small RNAs, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Because injecting siRNA,\nor short interfering RNAs, that is, or\nputting worms into an environment with\nan abundance of inhibitory RNAs as an\nexperiment, is very different from worms\nexperiencing something and then passing\non that acquired trait to their offspring.\nIt's a world apart, in my opinion,\nbecause one is an extreme manipulation\nthat illustrates an underlying\nprinciple, the other is something\nthat, in theory, occurs in the\npassage of generations, Just naturally\n.\n Oded Rechavi: We're going from the\nless artificial to the more artificial,\nthe advantages, just like with model\norganisms, that the more artificial\nit is, the easier it is to, you\nknow exactly what you did just now.\nIntroduce one factor and\nyou can follow the result.\nSo this is always the trade.\nWhat I did was, in Oliver's lab, was to\nsee whether part of the magic for the\nworms' resistance to viruses is their\ncapacity to transmit information in\nthe form of RNA molecules, inhibitory\nRNA molecules, to the next generations.\nAnd it has been shown before in C.\nelegans that the worms resist viruses\nusing this mechanism, these small RNAs.\nIn fact, this is probably the reason\nthat these small RNAs evolved in the\nfirst place, to get rid of viruses\nand other parasitic genomic elements,\nand this is a mechanism to fight them.\nAnd what I did is a\nvery simple experiment.\nI took worms and I\ninfected them with a virus.\nWhen you do this, this also\nhas been shown in the past.\nThe worms destroy the virus.\nOkay.\nWe demonstrated this very clearly\nusing a fluorescent virus.\nSo if the virus replicates\nsuccessfully, the worm just turns green.\nAnd if the virus is destroyed,\nthe worm stays black.\nThis is very simple.\nIt's a clear cut off.\nYou don't examine the worm and ask\nwhether it feels good, you just see.\nAndrew Huberman: This green\nlight binary response.\nOded Rechavi: Yes.\nAnd so we took worms, we infected them\nwith the fluorescent virus they destroyed.\nThis also has been done in the past.\nBut then what we did is we neutralized\nthe machinery that makes small RNAs\nin the descendants of the worms,\nso they cannot make small RNAs from\nthe start on their own, because\nthey just don't have the genes that\nyou need to make these small RNAs.\nOkay?\nAnd then we ask, what will happen?\nWill we affect these worms with the virus?\nWill they be green or black?\nThey can't make their own small\nRNAs, so they can't protect\nthemselves on their own.\nThe only way for them to stay black\nfor them, not having the virus\nreplicate is if they inherit the\nsmall RNAs from their parents.\nAnd this is exactly what happens.\nAll the worms' progeny, although they\ndon't have the gene that is needed\nfor making the small RNAs, are black.\nThey silence the virus.\nAnd this also continues\nfor additional generations.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, so the parent\nworms effectively put something\ninto the genetic instructions of the\noffspring that would afford them.\nLet's call it an advantage in this\ncase, but afford them an advantage\nif they were to be confronted with\nthe same thing that the parents were.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAnd we know exactly\nwhat this advantage is.\nThe advantages are small RNAs that\nmatch the viral genome and just chop\nup that virus in the next generation.\nAnd we can identify these small RNAs in\nthe inhibitory RNAs in the descendants,\nalthough they don't have the machinery\nto make it, just because they inherited.\nWe can identify them by sequencing, by RNA\nsequencing, which is like DNA sequencing.\nYou actually get the actual sequence\nof the RNA molecules, and we can see\nthat they correspond to the virus.\nAnd they inherited small RNAs only if\ntheir parents were infected with them.\nAndrew Huberman: So\nthere's specificity there.\nOded Rechavi: There's specificity.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, it's not just\nsome general resilience passage.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: I have to be careful\nin drawing an analogy that isn't\ncorrect, and I want to acknowledge\nthat what I'm about to say with\ncertainty cannot be entirely correct.\nBut the analogy that comes to\nmind in mammals is this idea that\nif one generation is stressed,\nthat their offspring may, in\nsome cases, have a higher stress\nthreshold, a resilience to stress.\nI could imagine why that\nwould be advantageous.\nYour parents have a hard life.\nThey have offspring, and they want their\nchildren to have a higher threshold\nto stress because stress can inhibit\nreproduction, etc., and as I always\nsay, at the end of the day and at\nthe end of life, evolution is about\nthe offspring, not about the parents.\nAnd every species pretty much seems to\nwant to make more of itself and protect\nits young one way or another, either\nthrough nature or through nurture.\nThis is a nature-based\nprotection of its young.\nIs it fair to say that in the mammalian\nexperiment with a passage of stress\nresilience, that it could be RNA-based,\nthat that would perhaps set some new\nthreshold on glucocorticoid production?\nHere I'm speculating, and I want to\nhighlight that I'm speculating, but\nI'm speculating with a reason, which\nis, I think for people that are hearing\nabout this in worms, you've done a\nbeautiful job of splaying out why model\norganisms are really important, but to\nthink about how this may operate in the\npassage of human generations, I think\nis a reasonable thing to entertain.\nOded Rechavi: Right, and it is true that\nalso in mammals now, RNAs and small RNAs\nare a leading candidate for something\nthat could mediate the transmission of\nstress protection or also of harmful\neffects that transmit between generations.\nPerhaps RNA does it.\nHowever, in worms, the RNAs have\none more trick that we don't know\nthe equivalent of in mammals yet.\nThis is something very crucial\nthat we showed in that particular\npaper, in the first paper.\nAndrew Huberman: Which is?\nOded Rechavi: So the effect that I\ndescribed, this transmission of resistance\nto viruses through these RNAs, doesn't\nonly affect the next generation, it also\naffects multiple additional generations.\nAndrew Huberman: So it gets passed?\nOded Rechavi: It gets passed.\nAnd you have to ask yourself,\nhow doesn't it get diluted?\nWhy isn't it diluted?\nBecause everyone produces 250 babies,\nso you dilute by 250, and if something\nis diluted for four generations, so it's\n250 times 250 after four generations,\nit's a dilution of four billions.\nCompletely homeopathic, would never work.\nIt's just there's nothing left.\nThe secret of these worms is that\nthey have a machinery for amplifying\nthe small RNAs in every generation.\nThis is called RNA-dependent\nRNA polymerase.\nIt's a complex which uses the RNA\nto find, and once it finds the\nmessenger RNA, just create many, many\nsmall RNAs so they don't get diluted\nand they pass on for additional\ngenerations, and this is the trick.\nWe later also identify genes that regulate\nfor how long an effect would last.\nOtherwise, if in the beginning\nwe ask how doesn't it stop after\none generation, now we have to\nask, why doesn't it last forever?\nAnd it doesn't typically, we see that the\nresponses last not only with the viral\nresistance, but also with other traits.\nFor a few generations, three to five\ngenerations, we found genes that\nfunction as a sort of a clock that\ntimes the duration of the inheritance.\nAndrew Huberman: What\nsorts of genes are those?\nOded Rechavi: So we call\nthese genes MoTeC genes.\nMoTeC.\nI don't know how is your Hebrew...\nAndrew Huberman: Not great.\nOded Rechavi: ...but MoTeC\nmeans sweetheart in Hebrew,\nbut the acronym is Modified\nTransgenerational Epigenetic kinetics.\nThere are different types of genes\nlike that, and for some of them,\nif you mutate, if you disrupt their\nfunction, now the effect would transmit\nstably for hundreds of generations.\nIt would never stop because their\nrole is to stop the inheritance.\nYou don't want to carry over something\nforever, otherwise it will no longer\nfit the environment of the parents and\nyou'll be prepared for the wrong things.\nSo this is important.\nWhat type of genes are they?\nOne gene that we studied, it's\ncalled Met-2, it's actually a gene\nthat functions in methylation of\nthe proteins that condense the DNA.\nBut then there are other genes that\nalso affect production of small RNAs.\nAndrew Huberman: Is there some mechanism\nthat controls the duration of passage\nin a way that logically links up\nwith the lifespan of the organism?\nSo, for instance, I knew\nmy grandparents, met them.\nI did not ever meet my great\ngrandparents and I certainly didn't\nmeet my great great grandparents.\nI could imagine that my great great\ngrandparents or my great grandparents\nexperienced certain things that\nwere passed into their children\nand perhaps into their children.\nBut it seems reasonable given that\nhumans live somewhere between zero and\n100 years, typically what now, 80 years?\nIs that the typical lifespan?\nMore or less, okay?\nThat if I were going to design the system,\nand again, I was not consulted at design\nphase, I would want an adaptive trait to\nbe passed for two generations, because\ngiven how long our species lives, and\ncertainly given the way the world looks\nnow, as opposed to the previous century\nor the turn of the previous century,\ndifferent stressors, different adaptation,\ndifferent life environments, and what I\nwould want to pass on to my offspring,\nI can basically hedge pretty well.\nI can place a good bet on the next 100\nyears, maybe the next 200, but I don't\nhave the foggiest clue what the world\nis going to look like in 300 years.\nDoes what I'm saying make\nany sense whatsoever?\nOded Rechavi: It makes a lot of sense.\nAnd really we need to talk about two\nthings in response to this question.\nFirst of all, yes, you can imagine\nthat the reason that the worms inherit,\ntypically for three to five generations,\nis that this is relevant to something\nthat happened in their environment.\nFor example, we also show that when you\nstarve the worms, it affects the next\ngenerations again for a few generations.\nAndrew Huberman: Which\nin itself is amazing.\nI just want to highlight that you\ncan imagine the next generation, it's\nsort of like a genetic version of,\n\"be careful, kids, but I'm going to\ngive you this extra lunch pack in\nyour genome that protects you against\nthe possibility of starvation.\"\nBut it's also saying, \"And, were you\nto have kids, they have it also.\"\nOded Rechavi: Yeah.\nSo I have to just make a\ndisclaimer that we don't know\nthat necessarily, it's adaptive.\nIt could also be damaged.\nAs I said, when you starve them,\nthe next generations live longer.\nBut this could be a trade off of a\ntrade off for fertility or something.\nSo other labs have also shown, following\nour work, that if you starve the\nworms, the next generations are also\nmore resistant to harsh starvation.\nThis is not our work,\nbut this sounds adaptive.\nOkay, but whenever you're talking\nabout adaptation, you have to see\nit in the context of evolution.\nThere's also this famous saying,\n\"nothing in biology makes sense\nexcept in the light of evolution.\"\nAnd so it's very hard to say without doing\nthe lab evolution experiments, we actually\nsee who wins, the ones that inherit or\nthe ones who don't hit, who takes over.\nOtherwise, it's hard to talk about\nwhether it's adaptive or not.\nBut when it comes to the duration\nof the response, yes, it could\nbe programmed to fit something.\nFor example, if you're talking about\nstarvation, worms transition between\nperiods of starvation and periods\nwhere they have a lot of food.\nSo let's say they find an apple for a few\ngenerations, they will consume the apple,\nand then they will be starved for a while.\nPerhaps this is the number of generations\nthat takes them to finish an apple.\nOr perhaps there are other responses\nalso to higher temperatures.\nIf you grow worms in higher\ntemperatures, the options are different.\nThey change how they mate.\nWhat I alluded to before.\nAndrew Huberman: We're going t\no get back to this because it\nrelates to cold exposure, which\nmany listeners are interested in.\nOded Rechavi: And perhaps it is somehow\ncorrelated with the cycle of the year.\nBut to tell you the truth, I don't know.\nAs I said, we go from the more\nartificial to the less artificial.\nIf double-strand RNA, just synthetic\nRNA, is the most artificial,\nstarvation is more natural.\nBut it's not starvation in\nthe real context of the world.\nIn a real apple, it's a\nplate with or without E.\nColi bacteria.\nBut it's not an apple on a tree exposed\nto the elements, with other worms, with\nbacteria, with all kinds of complications.\nAnd it could be that we will see\ndifferent durations of heritable\neffects the more natural we go.\nIt's just much less\ncontrollable and hard to do.\nAnd again, when we're talking about\nhumans, part of the argument is, why\npeople, why the disbelievers, it's\nnot about fate, but the critics say\nthat this wouldn't happen in humans.\nIf they say the worms' generation\ntime is just three days, the chances\nthat the parents' environment will\nmatch the children's environment is\nvery high because there's not a lot\nof time for the environment to change.\nPlus they can't go very\nfar, they're small.\nThere are many examples of\nepigenetic inheritance in plants.\nThis is a big field where there\nis very established proof for\ninheritance of acquired traits.\nFor epigenetic inheritance,\nbe more careful.\nEpigenetic inheritance of acquired\ntraits is a more loaded term,\nbut in plants it also happens.\nAnd there you also say\nthese are sessile organisms.\nThey can't run away.\nSo the environment is more constant.\nAndrew Huberman: Ideas, maybe just\na quick example that I've heard\nbefore, tell me if I'm wrong.\nI very well may be.\nFor instance, a particular species\nof plant that grows a straight, maybe\nslightly bent stalk might be exposed to\nsome environment where in order to capture\nenough sunlight and other nutrients\nmight need to grow in a corkscrew form.\nThe corkscrew form can be\ninherited for several generations.\nOded Rechavi: This is an example\nthat I don't know, but perhaps it--\n-- Andrew Huberman: something like that.\nTrust me, the one thing we know\nabout podcasting and YouTube is\nsomeone will tell us in the comments,\nand please do, we invite that.\nOded Rechavi: Right, but there's\na long history of epigenetic\ninheritance studies in plants, with\nexcellent studies, well controlled,\nshowing that it happens also there.\nSo this is very clear when it comes to\nhumans, you could say, maybe my kids\nwill go to live in a different continent,\nand they will be on the computer every\nday and everything will be different, so\nit makes less sense to prepare them for\nthe same hardships that I experience.\nHowever, in my opinion, this\nargument comes up a lot.\nIt's not the best argument, because\nit depends on the scale of how\nyou look at things we experience.\nWe meet, for example, I'm not saying\nthat this is inherited, but in humans,\nbut we experience the same pathogens\nand the same viruses all the time.\nSo perhaps it is worth preparing for that.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nOded Rechavi: Again, I'm not saying that\nit happens, but it depends on the scale.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, what you're\ndescribing makes perfect sense.\nAnd I do want to acknowledge these\ncritics, whoever they may be.\nI do have the advantage that I\ndon't work in this exact field.\nAnd so I'm happy to stand toe to toe\nwith those critics now and say that,\nat least in terms of inheritance of\nreactions or adaptive or maladaptive\ntraits, to stress or to reward.\nYou talked about nicotine\nbefore, a passage of response\nto drugs of different kinds.\nNot being specific to nicotine.\nIt was sort of a more general\npassage of some sort of information\nrelated to reactions to chemicals\npresent in nicotine, but other drugs.\nI have long been irritated and a little\nbit tickled by the fact that people\nsay, oh, we have this system for stress.\nThat was really designed to keep us safe\nfrom lions and saber-toothed tigers.\nSure, but the hallmark of the stress\nsystem is that it generalizes.\nI mean, if I get a troubling text message\nor if I suddenly see a dark figure in the\nhallway when I go to the bathroom at night\nthat I don't recognize, both of those\nhave the same generic response, which\nis the deployment of adrenaline in both\nbrain and body, changes in the optics of\nthe eyes, quickening of the heart rate.\nStress is, by design, generic.\nAnd so one could imagine that a passage\nof some sort of stress resilience\nor a maladaptive passage to stress\nwould be also somewhat generic, and\nthat's actually advantageous overall.\nSame thing with the reward system.\nWe essentially have one or two\nchemical systems of reward.\nI mean, there's the opioid system and\nthere's a cannabinoid system, but in\nlarge part, anticipation and reward\nis governed by the dopamine circuits.\nAnd anticipation and reward of an\nice cream cone for a kid is the same\nneural circuitry that's going to be\nrepurposed when they get to reproductive\nage, and they are anticipating\ncreating children with their mate.\nAnd assuming they want to\ndo that, the dopaminergic\nsystem is going to be engaged.\nSo ice cream, sex, stress to\nweather, stress to famine.\nThe biology of these more modal\nsystems, especially in the nervous\nsystem, are, again, I have to be\ncareful with the words, by design,\nare certainly generic, and so I don't\nsee the need for immense specificity.\nI mean, it's not like we're,\nwell, COVID just happened.\nSo could you imagine that there's the\npassage of a COVID-19 specific resilience?\nNo, I think what would probably be\npassed along would be some sort of, if\nit does occur, would be some sort of\nresilience to viruses more generally,\nand that would be advantageous.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nSo I agree.\nAnd this opens a question of what\nis the bandwidth of inheritance?\nHow specific can it be?\nDoes it make sense for it to be specific?\nAnd in the case of C.\nelegans, the response can be very\nspecific through this inheritance\nof RNAs, which are just sequence\nspecific, they downregulate,\nthey control one particular gene.\nIn other cases, it could\nbe a very general response.\nAnd it's very interesting to think\nabout it when we talk about inheritance\nof memories, which is the most\ninteresting thing we could imagine,\ncan brain activity of some sort\ntransmit, at least in these worms?\nI said no.\nI said this disclaimer multiple\ntimes in memories, we don't know.\nTime will tell in worms.\nWe know a lot.\nSo, can worms transmit brain activity?\nDo they have the specificity to do it?\nOkay, before I'll say that, I'll just\nsay that we, over the years, learned\na lot about the mechanisms that\nshuttle the RNAs between generations.\nWe know about genes that are needed\njust for that, about worms, that\nwould be perfectly okay, but just\ndon't have the capacity to transfer\nthe RNAs to the next generations.\nWe know about genes that will make\nthe responses longer or shorter.\nWe know about genes that prevent the\ntransfer of RNA between different tissues,\nabout genes that make certain small RNAs.\nSo we know a lot about that.\nAnd then the question arises,\nwe can finally ask, can memory\ntransfer between generations?\nI think that, first of all, we\nneed to define memory for that.\nAnd the broadest definition would be\nany change in your behavior because of\nwhat happened in the past or in your\nresponse because of what happened in\nthe past or because of your history.\nThe more interesting part, of\ncourse, is to talk about memories\nthat are encoded in the brain.\nAnd the reason is that the brain\nis capable of holding much more\nspecific and elaborate memories.\nI think that any tissues that\ntransmit, transfer to transmit RNA\nto the next generation and affect\nthe next generation is interesting.\nThe gut, muscles, everything.\nBut the brain can synthesize information\nabout the environment and about\ninternal state and can also think ahead.\nAnd the most provocative thing you can say\nis that you could plan somehow the fate\nof your nerve generation using your brain\nafter taking many things into the code.\nAndrew Huberman: This is\nwithout talking to them.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nWithout talking.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nSo again, we go back to\nthis instruction manual.\nIt's like writing something\ninto the instruction manual\nbased on your own experience.\nOded Rechavi: Right, and can it\nhappen and what is the bandwidth?\nCan we transfer specific things?\nAnd then I have to agree with you\nthat I would imagine that what can\ntransfer, and I could be wrong, is\na general something, sensitivity.\nYou can make the analogy to being inflamed\nor not, hypersensitive to pathogens,\nhyper vigilant, something like this.\nBut it can also be\nsomething very specific.\nNow, we have to understand that\nthe brain uses a different language\nthan the language of inheritance.\nThe brain, the way we normally think\nabout the brain is that it keeps\ninformation in synapses, in the\nconnections between different neurons.\nWhen you learn something, you make\nsome connections stronger and another\nconnection weaker, and you wire the\nnervous system in a different way.\nThe information in the brain is\nsynaptic, and it is in the connection.\nOn the other hand, heritable\ninformation of any sort has to go\nthrough a bottleneck of one cell.\nThe fertilized egg, because we all start\nfrom just one cell, so it cannot be in\nthe connections, because this cell doesn't\nhave any connections with other cells.\nIt's there alone.\nSo heritable information\nhas to be molecular.\nIt has to be inside this one cell.\nSo the question is, can you or do\nyou translate the information, this\n3D structure information of synapses\nand the connection between brains in\nthe architecture of the brain, can\nyou somehow translate it to heritable\ninformation to a molecular form?\nAndrew Huberman: It's an incredibly\nimportant and deep question.\nIt brings to mind something that was\nonce told to me, which as soon as I heard\nit was obvious, but was very important\nin formulating my understanding of\nbiology, which is that a map is just\nthe transformation of one set of points\ninto another set of points, right?\nSo a map of the world, essentially, is\njust, you take what's been drawn out\nin terms of the architecture and the\ncoastlines, etc., and divisions between\nstates, and you transfer that to an\nelectronic map or a piece of paper.\nIt seems so obvious.\nIt's sort of a duh, why\nare we talking about this?\nBut just to make sure that people\nunderstand what you're really talking\nabout is, let's say, the memory,\nand I have a very distinct memory\nfor my childhood phone number.\nPhone number doesn't exist anymore, and\nI won't give it out because then some\nother person might get repeated calls.\nBut in any case, I remember it.\nIt's totally useless information,\nbut it lives in my neocortex or my\nhippocampus or somewhere as a series\nof connections between neurons at\nthe locations as you call synapses.\nWould my grandchildren\nknow that phone number?\nThere's no reason.\nOded Rechavi: Absolutely no.\nAndrew Huberman: Right.\nWould my children know that unless\nthere was some adaptive reason or\nsome other reason for them to know,\nand this passage of acquired traits?\nAnd what you're saying is, in order\nfor that to happen, there has to\nbe a transformation of the neural\ncircuit, literally the wiring of\nneuron ABCD, that relates and carries\nthe information of that number into\nthe kind of nucleotide sequences\nthat are contained in DNA or patterns\nof methylation or RNA, more likely.\nSo it's a transformation of one set\nof points in physical space to a\ntranslation of points in genetic space.\nDoes that make sense?\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAnd then we have many problems.\nFirst of all, we don't know of a\nmechanism to translate between the two\ndifferent languages, the language of the\nbrain and the language of inheritance.\nWe are not familiar with\na mechanism like that.\nSecond, the next generation, if it's\nnot a worm, if it's a mammal would\nhave a different brain even if it was\ngenetically identical to the parent.\nThe wiring of the brain and the particular\nneuronal circuits will be different.\nThis is true for twins.\nIt will always be true because it\ndepends, because it's partly random and\nit depends on the environment, even if\nyou have the same genetic infections.\nSo let's say you somehow had a mechanism,\na miracle mechanism, to take the 3D\nInformation and translate it to the\nmagic, to the language of inheritance.\nYou would then in the next generation\nhave to translate it again to the\nbrain, although it is different.\nThis sounds very unlikely.\nI'm playing a trick on you now.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, I'm easy to trick.\n[LAUGHS]\nOded Rechavi: But if this is how it\nhappened or if this was required, it\ncould never happen, in my opinion,\nwhich means, and I still think that\nthere are certain memories that cannot\ntransfer transgeneration and these\ncomplex and things that you learn about\nthe environment that are arbitrary.\nNone of our listeners' kids\nwill remember this conversation.\nNo way.\nThis is impossible.\nAndrew Huberman: Unless they're\nlistening with them [LAUGHS] . There\nare some families or parents that\ntell me they listen with their kids.\nOded Rechavi: But it cannot transmit\nbecause it's random and these are\nconnections that are arbitrary.\nSo this seems to be a\nlimitation on what can transfer.\nOn the other hand, perhaps more general\nthings could pass, these types of things.\nI doubt they could pass.\nHowever, you can nevertheless imagine\nthat some things that are very specific,\nsome memories that are very, very specific\ncould nevertheless transmit from the brain\nafter learning to the next generation.\nI'll give you an example.\nYou can teach worms, even though they\nhave just 302 neurons, you can teach\nthem simple things about the world.\nFor example, you can take\nan odor that the worms like.\nThe worms have thousands of\nodorant receptors and they can\nrecognize many, many molecules.\nThey can smell them so they\ncan find food or avoid enemies.\nYou can take an odor that\nthe worms like and pair it to\nsomething bad, like starvation.\nAnd then the worms will\nlearn to dislike this odor.\nWe don't know that this learning\ninvolves necessarily changing\nthe strength of synapses.\nIt's a possibility, but it\ndoesn't have to be the case.\nIt could be that just the receptor\nfor this particular odor is being\nremoved and this is how they live now.\nThey won't have the receptor.\nThey won't smell.\nThey won't like the odor.\nThis is a possibility.\nThis type of thing, you can perhaps, not\nthat anyone has shown it convincingly,\ntransmit to the next generation because\nall it would take is an RNA that will\ncontrol this particular receptor.\nSo this is possible.\nPeople have shown things\nlike that not in C.\nelegans, but people have shown\nthings like this in mammals.\nThey said that you learn a certain\nthing, and then just in the next\ngeneration, thus a particular receptor\nwould be methylated or would change,\nand this would transmit the response.\nAnd on the one hand, it could be true.\nOn the other hand, you need to\nunderstand, they'll need to prove, and\nthis wasn't done convincingly enough\nyet, how exactly does the information\ntransfer from the brain to the germ\ncells, and then in the next generation,\nfrom the germ cells back to the brain\nto where the receptor needs to operate?\nAnd this is a challenge.\nThis is the current state of the\nfield, that this is something\nthat needs to be proven.\nWhat we did in C.\nelegans is we showed that the\nbrain can communicate with the\nnext generations using small RNAs,\nand that this can change behavior.\nAnd it doesn't require any\ntranslating between any language.\nIt is very simple.\nWhat we've shown is that if you take\na worm and you change the production\nof small RNAs just in its brain, in\nthe next generations, their behavior\nwill be different, even though\nyou don't mess with their brains.\nThis is a paper that we\npublished in 2019 in Cell.\nWe show that you just manipulate the\nproduction of endogenous natural RNAs\nin the worm's brain that are always\nmade, but you change their amount, and\nthis changes the capacity of the worms\nin the next generation to find food,\nto find not only in one generation,\nbut three generations down the road.\nAnd the way that it works is that\nperturbing the production of these small\nRNAs in the brain affects, in the end,\nthe expression of a gene in the germline.\nOne gene, it is called SAGE-2, we\ndon't know how it works, but we can\ndo all kinds of controls where we\nmanipulate activity of the gene and\nsee that this also affects behavior.\nAnd this gene works in the germ cells.\nThe information needs to go from\nthe brain to the germ cells.\nIt doesn't need to go back from the germ\ncells to the brain to affect behavior.\nAnd this depends, we know that this\nis a true epigenetic effect because it\ngoes on for multiple generations, and\nalso because it requires the machinery\nthat transfers RNAs between generations.\nIf you don't have the protein that\nphysically carries the RNA between\ngenerations it doesn't happen.\nAndrew Huberman: So it has to be RNA.\nOded Rechavi: It has to be RNA.\nWe can also find the RNAs in\nthe next generation that change.\nWe sequence the actual RNAs that\nchange in the next generation.\nAndrew Huberman: You mentioned that you\ndon't know what SAGE, this gene SAGE\ndoes, but is it reasonable to assume that\nit does something in the context of the\nnervous system or, that's unclear as well?\nOded Rechavi: It is possible.\nIt is possible, but we have reasons to\nbelieve or experiments to show, although\nthere could be alternative explanations,\nthat it functions through the germline.\nNow, you may ask, how can you affect\nbehavior just by changing the germ cells?\nRight?\nAndrew Huberman: Well, it would have to\nchange the germ cells in very specific\nways, because, as people probably recall,\nthe germline, germ cells are where the\ninheritable information is contained.\nBut you can imagine it, for instance,\nadjusting the gain or sensitivity, rather,\non some sort of sensory foraging system.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nThe interesting thing is it,\nagain, can be quite unspecific.\nSo it sounds weird that you\nchange germ cells and it changes\nbehavior, sperm and egg, but if\nyou think about it, it's trivial.\nIf you castrate a dog, it\nbehaves differently, right?\nAndrew Huberman: Sadly, yeah, I\ndid that to my dog and I ended up\nputting him on testosterone therapy\nlater and it brought him back.\nJust as an aside.\nOded Rechavi: Yes.\nThis is because the germ cells\naffect the soma, including the brain,\nin many ways by secreting certain\nchemicals, and also because the other\ncells develop from the germ cells.\nSo some information could be transmitted\nover development, or the course of\ndevelopment could be altered because of\nchanges that occur in the germ cells.\nFor example, in mammals, one of the\nexplanations for how heritable information\ntransmits is that it just affects\nsomething very early on in development.\nI told you that the secret to worms'\ninheritance is that they have the capacity\nto amplify these small RNAs all the time.\nThis is what keeps it going\nand prevents the dilution.\nIn mammals, we don't know of\nsuch an amplification mechanism.\nSo you ask, how can a little bit of\nRNA or something without amplifying\naffect the entire organism?\nAnd it could be that you just perturb\nsomething in the very beginning when\nyou just have a few cells or even in\nthe placenta that develops in pregnancy,\nand this later throws everything off.\nAnd because of that, you have many\nproblems in metabolism and so on.\nAnd this is called, it's an\nidea of the developmental\norigin of health and disease.\nMany of the functions occur\nearly on in development.\nAndrew Huberman: So you've raised a number\nof incredibly fascinating aspects to this.\nI do have a question about one particular\naspect, and feel free to pass on\nthis for a future episode if it's\ngoing to take us too far off track.\nBut something you said, it really\ncaptured my attention, although I was\nlistening to all of it, which is that\nthe germ cells so in the case of males,\nit's going to be sperm, and in the\ncase of females, it's going to be eggs.\nSomething perhaps not coincidental about\nthose cells and the environment that they\nlive in is that, yes, they contain the\ngenetic information of past offspring.\nOf course, you explain how that works.\nBut also those cells live in a region\nthat is rich with hormones that can be\nsecreted and in fact, are secreted, and\nthrough so called endocrine signaling,\ncommunicate with other cells, not just\nat the level of receptors on their\nsurface, but also can enter the genomes\nof those cells and modify those cells.\nIn other words, it seems to me that\nthe microenvironment of the germ\ncells, the testes and the ovaries\nare rich with information, not just\nfor the passage to next generations,\nbut also for all the, as you said,\nall the somatic cells of the body.\nThey're telling the somatic cells of\nthe body what to do and what to become.\nAnd the best example I can think\nabout this would be puberty, right?\nI mean, I would argue that one of the\ngreatest rates of aging and transitions\nwe go through in life is from puberty.\nI mean, a child becomes a very\ndifferent person after puberty.\nThey look at the world differently,\nthey think about it differently.\nIt's not just about the growth\nof the hair and the jaw and the\nAdam's apple and breasts and so on.\nIt's a transformation of the somatic\ncells from the same microenvironment\nthat the DNA containing cells reside.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nSo once you think about it like\nthis, it becomes obvious that just\nby affecting the germ cells, you\ncan affect the rest of the body.\nAnd in C.\nelegans, there are experiments\nthat show it very clearly.\nSo, for example, if you just take\nworms and prevent sperm production,\nit changes their capacity to smell.\nThese are experiments done by others,\nwhich is obviously a brain function.\nAndrew Huberman: And in a castrated\ndog, you're not just eliminating the\npossibility of transfer of DNA information\nto subsequent generations, you're also--\nOded Rechavi: --Limiting\ntheir personality.\nAndrew Huberman: Without question, my\nbulldog Costello changed after castration,\nand it was a wonderful dog, but at some\npoint developed some health issues.\nThe introduction of a small amount of\ntestosterone every other day changed\nhim fundamentally, in that case, for\nthe better, back to a version of himself\nthat I had only observed earlier, but\nalso a different version of the same dog.\nAnd no, he wasn't humping everything,\nmaybe the occasional knee?\n[LAUGHS] Particular people,\nwhose names I won't mention.\nBut it was absolutely clear that\nthe hormone was not just taking\na system and amplifying it.\nIt was actually modifying the system.\nSo, anyway, I just wanted to highlight\nthat and then now, thank you for indulging\nme, if you will, let's continue down this\npath that we were going on, because I want\nto make sure that we absolutely get to\nthis issue of transmission of information\nabout sex, choice of offspring.\nOded Rechavi: So the worms are\nhermaphrodites, which means that they make\nboth sperm and an egg, but they are also\nmales, which are much more rare, and they\ncan choose to mate with the males or not.\nWhen they mate with a male, it's a\nhuge decision because it's very costly\nenergetically, and they also risk\npredation and all kinds of troubles.\nThe males hurt them and reduce their\nlifespan when they mate with them.\nAndrew Huberman: People are going\nto draw all sorts of analogies\nhere, but it's inevitable.\nBut, hey, here we go.\nOded Rechavi: And most importantly\nfor evolution, when you mate with\nanother animal, you dilute your genome\nin half, because the worms can just\nself fertilize and transmit the exact\nsame genome to the next generation.\nBut when they mate,\nthey dilute it in half.\nSo this is a big price to pay.\nOn the other hand, when you\nmate, you diversify your genome.\nSo maybe some combination\nof genes will be good.\nAndrew Huberman: And\nwe know that in humans.\nI mean, it's kind of interesting that\nthe brain circuits that are associated\nwith aversion and with approach\nare fairly hardwired for a number\nof things, like a puddle of vomit,\nalmost everybody kind of cringes.\nPlate of cookies.\nIf you like cookies, you move towards it.\nBut there's one particular word in the\nEnglish and presumably Israeli language\nthat ought to evoke disgust, and that's\nincest, because incest is actually\nnot just disgusting as a practice,\nbut it's dangerous genetically, right?\nBecause of inbreeding, it\ncreates a deleterious mutation.\nOded Rechavi: Right, so there are\nstudies on how people in Israeli\nkibbutz, for example, where they all grow\ntogether, the children live together.\nIt used to be like that,\ndon't date each other.\nThis is the classic thing.\nI talked to some of whom the\nkibbuti told me that's not true,\nbut yes, there are studies like\nthis that say, but it makes sense.\nAndrew Huberman: And in some countries,\nScandinavian countries, or in Lapland\nand Iceland, where populations are\nsmall, they keep exquisite records of\nlineage in order to avoid inbreeding.\nOded Rechavi: Right?\nSo you're absolutely right.\nBut the worms, the safe choice\nfor them is to self mate.\nAnd if they mate with a male, they\ntake a risk, but they diversify.\nOkay, what we found is that if you\ntake the hermaphrodites, we can call it\nthe female for just one second and you\nstress it with high temperatures, then\nthe next generations of worms, for three\ngenerations, mate much more with males.\nAnd they do it because the female\nstarts secreting a pheromone\nthat attracts the males.\nAndrew Huberman: It's a\nvery cryptic mechanism.\nIt's not that she somehow changes\nand then goes seeking males.\nIt draws males.\nOded Rechavi: It draws males.\nAnd we know how it works.\nWe think we know how it works.\nWhat happens is that the stress, the\nhigh temperatures, compromise the\nproduction of sperm in the hermaphrodites.\nSo the hermaphrodites don't, they\nmake sperm enough to make next\ngenerations, but the sperm, because\nof defective small RNA, inherited.\nBecause the RNAs are not inherited, okay?\nThe sperm is not made optimally,\nso they make less sperm.\nAnd when they don't make a lot\nof sperm, they feel that they\ndon't self-fertilize correctly.\nSo they call the males by secreting\nthe pheromones so that it would\nprovide its own sperm and they\ncan continue to make babies.\nAnd we know this also from experiment.\nYou just take hermaphrodites and you\nkill its sperm, it starts secreting\npheromone and the males come.\nAndrew Huberman: It's a need-based system.\nOded Rechavi: Exactly.\nAndrew Huberman: Incredible.\nAnd I hope people can appreciate as\nthey're hearing this, that none of this\nwe assume, I don't know how to speak worm.\nNone of this, we assume, is a conscious\ndecision in these animals, much like\nhuman mating behavior, which to us\nalways seems so conscious, but is\nbeing governed by both conscious\nand subconscious decision making.\nNone of this is an active decision to\nsecrete the hormone to draw in more males.\nIt's simply a biasing of probabilities.\nThe hormone is now secreted in greater\nquantities or greater frequency.\nThe males therefore approach more.\nSo it's just increasing the\nprobability of interactions.\nIs that right?\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nWhat happens naturally, normally, if\nyou don't stress the ancestors, is\nthat the worms start secreting the\npheromone only when they are old.\nThis is also people will--\nAndrew Huberman: --When they're\nrunning out of their own fertility.\nOded Rechavi: Exactly.\nBecause they only make the sperm\nat a particular time and then\nthey run out of self sperm.\nThey can't self-fertilize.\nSo they have to call the males\nif they want to continue to mate.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, this is sort\nof the plastic surgery approach.\nOkay, I'll take the heat for that one.\nBut it's true, I think as certain\npeople age to a certain point and they\nfeel that their fertility is waning.\nIf they want offspring, they need to\ntake any number of different approaches.\nHere we're talking about a female,\nbut we could also do the reverse.\nRight.\nSperm donor.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: But if they want to\nattract a lifelong mate or co-parent\nwith somebody, oftentimes they will do\nthings to adjust their attractiveness\nin any number of different ways.\nPsychological attractiveness\nor physical attractiveness.\nI'm not afraid to bring this up because\nI think that the parallels are very\nimportant, because I do think that\nevery species and individuals within\na species, of course, decides whether\nor not they want to reproduce or not,\nbut has an inherent understanding,\nconscious or subconscious, about where\nthey reside in the arc of their lifespan.\nI do believe that not\njust based on experience.\nSome people are very attuned\nto the passage of time being\nvery fast, others very slow.\nI think that knowing how long\nyour parents and their parents\nlived makes a big difference.\nI have friends whose fathers in\nparticular died fairly young.\nAnd all these guys basically got\nmarried and had kids really young.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nSo here, luckily for me, I don't have\nto get into the psychology of the worms.\nThe explanation is just like an instinct.\nWhen they run out of sperm,\nthey start secreting the\npheromone and attract the males.\nThere are studies also in Newman's\nabout older fathers, that children\nof older fathers have a higher\nchance of becoming autistic.\nThere are studies--\nAndrew Huberman: --40 and up, basically.\nOded Rechavi: However, in this case,\nit's not clear that this is something\nin epigenetics, could be just because\nof DNA damage, because it accumulates.\nAndrew Huberman: And actually nowadays,\nwe have an episode on fertility\ncoming up, both male and female\nfertility, and there are actually\nDNA fragmentation kits for at home.\nDNA fragmentation kits or sperm analysis.\nYou send the sperm back\nin, you don't do the DNA.\nPeople pipetting semen at home would\nbe an odd picture, let's not go there.\nBut there are clinics that\ndo this for a nominal charge.\nBut I did want to ask about autism\nand human disease in particular.\nAnother thing that you hear\nsometimes, and here I want to\nacknowledge, autism is on a spectrum.\nSome people get upset if\nyou call it a disorder.\nThere are some adaptive\nautistic traits, etc.\nBut one thing that often comes up is this\nidea that two people who are more of the\nkind of engineering hard science, if you\nwill, of phenotype mate and have children.\nHigher probability of the offspring\nbeing on the spectrum, some people\nwould argue, but that's already\nselecting for people that might have\nalready been partially on the spectrum.\nSo maybe it's a gene copy issue.\nI'm not asking you to comment on autism\nin particular, but when you hear things\nlike that, that the children of older\nfathers born from older fathers tend\nto have a higher probability of autism.\nAt the level of intuition, does that\nstrike you as an epigenetic phenomenon,\nas a nurture mishmash or the possibility\nthat it's RNA passage or anything?\nDoes anything sort of trigger\nthe whiskers, your spidey sense?\nOded Rechavi: So in that case, I\nwould go with the most parsimonious\nexplanation, which is it's just\nless fidelity, less DNA maintenance\nand some damage that passes on.\nIt doesn't have to be an epigenetic thing.\nAndrew Huberman: But the sperm are\ngenerated once every 60 days, so the\ndamage must be at the level of the germ\ncells not having the proper machinery.\nOded Rechavi: Right.\nAndrew Huberman: Mitochondria\nor something like that.\nOded Rechavi: Or the DNA repair machinery.\nThe DNA repair machinery could be\ndefective or could work less well in older\npeople, leading to the constant production\nof germ cells with more mutation.\nThis is a possibility.\nAndrew Huberman: Do we know exactly\nwhat the DNA repair machinery is?\nOded Rechavi: Yes, there are\nmany types of DNA repair.\nThere's one that use other\ncopies of the DNA to correct.\nThere are ones that just recognize all\nkinds of lesions on the DNA and remove it.\nIt's a very elaborate\nand complicated system.\nAndrew Huberman: And is it a system\nthat is now tractable, that can\nbe modified through pharmacology\nor through anything like that?\nOded Rechavi: So I don't know about\ndrugs that correct that, improve it.\nMaybe they exist and I'm not aware,\nbut it's very well understood and many\npeople are studying this direction.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah.\nOne thing that came across in the\nexploration of the fertility work is\nthat what I'm about to describe is not\nlegal in the US, it is illegal, but is\nlegal in the UK and in other countries,\nis this notion of three parent IVF,\nwhere it does seem that some of the eggs\nthat persist in older females, even if\nfertilized, don't produce healthy embryos.\nThey have chromosomal abnormalities,\nreplications, and deletions that are\nproblematic for the development of the\nembryo, such as trisomy 21 aka down\nsyndrome, in part or in large part because\nof deficits in the mitochondrial genome.\nSo what they now do is they take the,\nbecause the mitochondrial genome resides\nmainly in the cytoplasm, they'll take\nan egg from the mother, the sperm\nfrom the father, but they'll take the\nnucleus from the mother and put that\ninto a cytoplasm of a younger woman\nwhose mitochondrial DNA is healthy, then\nuse the sperm to fertilize that egg.\nAnd that's why it's called three parent\nIVF, then implant that into the mother.\nAnd this has been done several times\nin cases of mitochondrial damage or\nmutations in the mother, it works.\nThe question is whether or not those\noffspring will grow up to be healthy.\nSo this, of course, is not\njust a pure divergence.\nIt raises a bigger question\nthat I have for you, which is in\nterms of the work in either C.\nelegans or in other model\norganisms, but in particular in C.\nelegans.\nWhere do you see this going next?\nAnd if you would indulge us, I\nwould love for you to tell us a\nlittle bit about the admittedly\nunpublished work that you're doing on\ntemperature exposure and environments.\nI mean, how malleable is this system?\nBecause to me, it just\nseems incredibly malleable.\nAnd yet a lot of it's\nstill cloaked off to us.\nThere's still a ton to learn.\nOded Rechavi: So, assuming that\nwe will discover similar things in\nhumans, which we don't know that this\nis the case, but let's say we find\nit, I think there are many things\nyou can do before you change it.\nFor example, you could also change\na parent inheritance by having\nthe parent exercise, for example.\nSome things like this have been done.\nFor example, there are experiments in\nrodents where they show that overfeeding\nthe rodents creates problems for the\nnext generations, for the children.\nHowever, if you let the rodent exercise,\nthen it corrects the aberrant inheritance.\nSo this is one possibility.\nAnd you can also manipulate\nit at the source.\nYou can change, if it's RNAs, let's say\nyou could, in the future, perhaps, if we\nunderstand how it works, actually change\nthe composition of the heritable RNAs.\nAndrew Huberman: By eating RNAs,\njust like the worms RNA sandwich.\nOded Rechavi: No.\nSo the RNA sandwich will be\ndifficult because it's not.\nI don't know.\nBut if you do IVF, if you do any\nvitro fertilization, you can perhaps\nchange the composition of the RNAs\nin the stuff that you introduce.\nBut way before that, what you could\ndo, perhaps even in the not so far\nfuture, is use this for diagnostics,\nDNA based diagnostics for every\ncouple that wants to have a kid.\nIn Israel, this is done for most couples.\nYou can look at the DNA and look\nfor genetic disease, but no one is\nlooking at the RNA at the moment.\nIf we understand how it works\nbetter, we'll have another level,\na whole new world to look at.\nAnd perhaps there will be some RNAs\nthat correlate with disease that\nwill say, okay, the beauty is that\nthis, unlike DNA, it's plastic.\nSo with DNA, this is your DNA,\nperhaps we can choose another embryo.\nBut here you could say,\nperhaps again in the future.\nThis is science fiction, it doesn't\nhappen now, but if we understand this\nand it's true, we can say, maybe you\nshould run on the treadmill a little bit.\nThis will change the profile of your\nRNAs, and then we will use it for IVF.\nThis seems more, because it correlates\nwith healthy profiles of RNAs.\nThis is a level that no one looks\nat now and holds great potential.\nAgain, with a disclaimer that we don't\nknow how it works in humans at all yet.\nBut, of course, this is\nwhy it's so interesting.\nAndrew Huberman: Yeah, it's super\ninteresting, incredibly promising.\nSo, along the lines of things\nthat one can do in the short\nterm and your experiments on C.\nelegans, I'd love for you to share\nwith us what you're observing\nabout cold exposure and how that\nimpacts subsequent generations of C.\nelegans.\nAnd if you would indulge us with the\nstory of this discovery, like some of\nthe earlier stories you told us, it\nis a surprising and fascinating one.\nOded Rechavi: I'll\ngladly tell you about it.\nThis is not a story about\ntransgenerational inheritance.\nIt's a story about memory\nwithin one generation.\nAndrew Huberman: Excuse me.\nOded Rechavi: Within one generation.\nOkay, and as you said, the story of how\nit happens is it's totally by accident.\nIt's a funny story.\nAnd I'm bringing this up because I know\nDana Lanchev, who's a huge fan of your\npodcast, will really be happy, that this\nis her work and this is unpublished work.\nWe didn't even finish it,\nso we're working on it.\nAndrew Huberman: Okay, well, when\nit's published, we will feature the\npaper, Because I love this story.\nOded Rechavi: Great.\nWhat happened is that we talked about\ntransgenerational memories, and I\nsaid that in worms, there are very\nlong transgenerational memories.\nIf a generation time for C.\nelegans is three days, some\nmemories last for many generations.\nSo way beyond the lifespan of the worm.\nThe lifespan of the worm is three weeks.\nYou have a new generation\nevery three days, but every\nworm lives for three weeks.\nBut there's a lot of research that\nshows that unlike heritable memory,\nwhich can be very long, the memory\nthat the worms acquired during\ntheir lifetime Is very short lived.\nSo if you teach something\nafter 2 hours, it forgets.\nSo, for example, you can teach the\nworm, you can take an odor that it\nlikes and pair it with starvation,\nand then it would dislike the odor.\nAnd then there's a simple test.\nYou just put it in a plate.\nYou put the odor in one side and a\ncontrol order in the other side, and\nyou see whether it prefers this odor\nor not, and it stops preferring it.\nOkay.\nThere is 30 years or more of research\nor 40 years of research on this showing\nthat the worms forget after two hours.\nThe reason I went to study C.\nelegans is that I wanted to\nunderstand memory because of\nsuch a simple nervous system.\nMaybe I have the potential to\nactually understand how it works,\nbut this is slightly disappointing\nbecause they forget after 2 hours.\nSo what is it exactly?\nOkay, my idea was, and I tried to\nconvince students to do it for ten years,\nis to take the worms, teach them this\nassocIation to dislike the odor that\nthey innately like, and then just put the\nworms in -80 and freeze them, freeze them\ncompletely, thaw them and see whether\nthey still remember after they are thawed.\nAndrew Huberman: The Han Solo experiment.\nOded Rechavi: And I didn't w ant to\ndo it because of cryopreservation\nor something like this.\nI wanted to do it because as you know\nbetter than me, many theories about\nmemory say that you need electrical\nactivity to maintain the memory.\nYou need to reverberate it in the brain.\nAndrew Huberman: During dreams or\nreplay of the thing or whatever.\nOded Rechavi: And if the memories\nwill nevertheless be kept even\nthough the worms were frozen in -80\nit would mean that it was kept in\nthe absence of electricity because\nthere's no electricity in -80 degrees.\nThis was the idea.\nI asked many students, no one\nwanted to do it because it's not\nso easy and also a little crazy.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, and when\nthe PI, the principal investigator\nor lab has a pet experiment, no\none wants to do that experiment.\n[LAUGHS]\nOded Rechavi: That is universally true.\nAnd then Dana agreed to do it.\nDana Lanchev I was very happy only\nlater to find out that she ignored me\ncompletely and did a different experiment.\nThe experiment that Dana did instead\nis to just take the worms, teach them\nthe association and place them on ice.\nShe wanted to see how the\nkinetics of memory and forgetting\nchange in low temperature.\nBecause maybe whatever memory\nis, the breakdown of the memory\nis affected by the temperature.\nA very simple idea, we\nknow, different experiment.\nA different experiment, but\na cool experiment, very cool.\nAnd what she found is that when you\nplace the worms on ice after you teach\nthem, they just don't forget even ten\ntimes longer than control worms at\nthat point, after 24 hours, if normal\nworms forget after 2 hours, after 24\nhours, the worms will become sick.\nSo normally we do shorter experiments,\nbut for 2 hours, the worms don't forget.\nThis is cool, but it was only the\nbeginning because the boring explanation\nis just what I just said, that everything\nslows down in low temperatures.\nSo the breakdown of memory again, we\ndon't know what it is, but whatever it\nis happens slower in low temperatures.\nBut this is not the case.\nIt's not merely the physical.\nIt's the response.\nIt's the changing of the\ninternal state of the worms which\naffects the memory kinetics.\nHow do we know this?\nThere's been beautiful work over the\nlast year on cold tolerance in C.\nelegans nematodes.\nIf you take the worms and you\nplace them on ice like she did, but\nlonger, for 48 hours, they all die.\nHowever, if you take the worms, acclimate\nthem to lower temperatures for a few\nhours, 5 hours is a minimum, and then\nplace them on ice, they all survive.\nThey become cold tolerant.\nAnd people who study this show\nthat this involves changes in\nlipid metabolism and many things.\nSo Dana took the worms, acclimated them\nto slightly lower temperatures, made\nthem cold resistant, and then taught them\nthe association and placed them on ice.\nAnd now they forgot immediately, which\nmeans that when they change their internal\nstate to become cold tolerant, they no\nlonger extend memories on ice, which means\nit's not only the temperature, because\nthe temperature was in any way low.\nNow they know the memory.\nWe took this as a starting point\nto understand which genes change\nwhen the worms are becoming\ncold tolerant on and off ice.\nAnd we found genes that when you mutate\nthem, the worms just remember longer,\nalways, even when they're off ice, because\nthese are the genes that normally change\nwhen they are surprised on the ice.\nAnd these genes are expressed just in one\npair of neurons, just two out of the 302.\nAndrew Huberman: Notice\nhe said 302, not 300.\nOded Rechavi: And we can manipulate\nthe activities of these genes in\nthese neurons to extend memory.\nAnd then the punchline of everything\nthat happened is that we found\nout that this neuron, where these\ngenes function, this one pair of\nneurons, is the only neuron in C.\nelegans which is sensitive to lithium.\nAnd lithium is a drug that has being given\nto bipolar disorder patients for decades.\nAlthough it's not entirely clear how\nit works, it's very, very interesting.\nIt is also interesting,\nthere's an episode, of course,\nin your podcast about this.\nYou know more about this than me, a lot.\nBut it's also interesting because\nit's just an atom created in the\nBig Bang, yet it works on our\nbrains in such a fundamental way.\nAnd we wanted to see whether it\nworks also on the worms, because\nthis neuron was tied to this memory\nextension phenotype that we found.\nSo Dana grew the worms on lithium,\nremoved them from lithium, taught them\nthe association, and found out that they\nremember a lot longer than control worms.\nNot only that, if you first make the\nworms cold tolerant and then lithium\ndoesn't work on them, lithium switches\nthis forgetfulness mechanism on and off.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing.\nOded Rechavi: And it's all\nconnected to cold tolerance.\nAndrew Huberman: Amazing and\namazing for a number of reasons.\nAnd so, at risk of being long winded\nin my response, I just wanted to\nhighlight something that I think\nwill be of relevance to most people,\nwhich is when, at some point,\nwe did a few episodes on memory.\nAnd I highlighted a review that was\nwritten by the great James McGaugh, one\nof the great mammalian memory researchers\nwho's worked a lot on humans and mice.\nAnd I was shocked, pun intended,\nand amused to learn that in medieval\ntimes, if people wanted children\nto remember lessons, they could be\nreligious lessons or school doctrine\nor whatever it was, mathematics, they\nwould take children, teach them, and\nthen throw them into cold water to\nintroduce a memory instilling event.\nAnd we now know that the memory instilling\nevent is the release of adrenaline in\nthe body, which makes perfect sense\nif you think about traumatic events.\nBut this whole general mechanism\nalso applies to the learning\nof other types of information.\nAnd so, if I understand correctly about\nthe role of lithium and the role of\ncold in the experiments that you just\ndescribed, there's some general state\nswitch, some internal state switch that\nsays, what happened in the minutes or\nhours preceding this was important.\nIt acts as sort of like a highlighter\npen in the Book of Experiences.\nAnd I'm absolutely curious to\nknow whether or not this is an RNA\ndependent mechanism in some way.\nSo, is this literally like the\nhighlighter in the IKEA instruction book?\nOded Rechavi: This we don't know.\nThis we don't know, and as I said,\nthis is not even a finished work.\nIt's not peer reviewed.\nIt's just the state that I told you about.\nBut it's very exciting for me to go\ninto this new field, and once it's\nout, I'll be happy to talk more about\nit and think about the implications\nand the connection to other things\nand more about the mechanisms.\nYeah.\nAndrew Huberman: Well, thank\nyou for sharing it with us.\nDespite the fact that it's\nnot finished, people now know\nthat it's also not finished.\nAnd I love a good cliffhanger.\nSo we await the full conclusion and\ninterpretation of these results.\nToday, you've taken us on an\namazing journey through the genome.\nRNA, short interfering RNAs, a ton\nof history of prior experiments,\nsome of which ended tragically, many\nof which, unfortunately, did not.\nThey were true triumphs, and\nin particular, the work in your\nlaboratory, which is just incredible.\nAnd also this introduction\nof model organisms.\nAnd I only mentioned a short\nhandful of the things that\nyou've taught us about today.\nSo, first, I want to extend thanks\nfor the incredible teaching.\nI also want to say thank you for\nsomething equally important, which is\nthat absolutely came through, but is what\ninitially brought me to explore you and\nyour work more, although I had certainly\nheard of you, which is that your spirit\nand kind of approach to biology is an\nextremely unique and intoxicating one.\nOded Rechavi: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: Even I\nventure to call it seductive.\nI do believe that whether or not it's\nmusic or poetry or science or mathematics,\nthat the spirit behind something dictates\nthe amount of intelligence and precision\nwith which that thing is carried out.\nAnd it absolutely comes through.\nSo if I'm making you feel on the\nspot about this, I've succeeded.\nOded Rechavi: Thank you.\nThank you very much.\nAndrew Huberman: But I know\nthat the listeners can feel it.\nIt's a felt thing.\nSo thank you.\nThere are many scientists out there,\nfewer with this phenotype and even\nfewer that I think that can communicate\nwith such articulate precision.\nSo thank you so much.\nOded Rechavi: Thank you.\nAndrew Huberman: It's\nbeen a real pleasure.\nOded Rechavi: Pleasure was all mine.\nThanks a lot.\nAndrew Huberman: Great.\nWell, we'll do it again, and we'll learn\nabout all the incredible things you're\ndoing trying to transform science, as\nit were, at the level of publishing,\nat the level of social media, because\nthere's a whole other discussion there.\nMeanwhile, we will, of course,\npoint people in the direction of you\nand to learn more about your work.\nAnd I look forward to hearing\nthe conclusion of Dana's studies.\nOded Rechavi: Thanks a lot.\nIt's been a real pleasure.\nAndrew Huberman: Thank you for joining\nme today for my discussion with Dr.\nOded Rechavi about genetics,\ninheritance, the epigenome and\ntransgenerational passage of traits.\nIf you're learning from and or\nenjoying the podcast, please\nsubscribe to

This is a zero cost monthly\nnewsletter that consists of podcast\nsummaries and so called toolkits.\nAnd those toolkits range from\nthings like a toolkit for sleep,\nfor focus, for controlling dopamine,\ndeliberate cold exposure, for\nincreasing focus, and much, much more.\nIf you want to sign up for that\nnewsletter, you can go to hubermanlab.com.\nGo to the menu, scroll down to newsletter.\nYou simply provide your email,\nand I assure you we do not\nshare your email with anybody.\nAnd again, it's a completely\nzero cost newsletter.\nFind it at hubermanlab.com.\nThank you once again for joining\nme for today's discussion with Dr.\nOded Rechavi.\nAnd last but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[CLOSING THEME MUSIC]"
