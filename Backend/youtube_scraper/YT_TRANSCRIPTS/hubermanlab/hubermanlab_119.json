professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday is an ask me\nanything or AMA episode,\nwhich is part of our\npremium subscriber content.\nOur premium channel\nwas launched in order\nto raise support for the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast\nchannel, which still comes\nout once a week every Monday\nand, of course, is\nzero cost to consumer.\nThe premium channel\nis also designed\nto support exciting\nresearch being\ndone at major universities\nlike Stanford and elsewhere,\nresearch that's done on humans\nthat should lead to protocols\nfor mental health,\nphysical health,\nand performance in\nthe near future.\nIf you'd like to check out the\npremium channel subscription\nmodel, you can go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium,\nand there you can subscribe\nfor $10 a month or $100 a year.\nWe also have a lifetime\nsubscriber option.\nFor those of you that are\nalready Huberman Lab podcast\npremium subscribers and you're\nwatching and/or hearing this,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium\nand download the\npremium podcast feed.\nAnd for those of you\nthat are not already\nHuberman Lab premium\npodcast subscribers,\nyou will be able to hear\nthe first 15 minutes or so\nof this episode,\nand hopefully, that\nwill allow you to discern\nwhether or not you would like\nto become a premium subscriber.\nWithout further ado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nAnd as always, I will strive\nto be as accurate as possible,\nas thorough as possible, and\nyet, as concise as possible.\nOur first question\nis about motivation,\nin particular, how to\nmaintain motivation\nover long periods of time.\nThis was the question\nasked by Martin Zokov.\nHe wrote, \"I alternate\nbetween periods\nof two different states\nthat vary from a few weeks\nto a couple of months.\nI have extremely high\nmotivation in one state,\nwhere I can do multiple things--\nside projects, making music,\nas well as my main things,\nor really low-motivational\nstates, where I can barely\ndo anything, and I only look\nfor short term entertainment.\"\nI'm guessing, short-term\nentertainment comes\nin the form of video\ngames, social media,\nand just doing generally\nunproductive things,\nas we all do from time to time.\nHe goes on to write, \"What would\nbe the best set of protocols\nto normalize those\nextremes into a more\nstable and consistent state?\"\nWell, first off, this is\nan excellent question.\nI say that because it's a\nquestion that I hear a lot,\nand I think that many people\nare interested in knowing how\nmotivated they ought to feel.\nAnd I think a lot of\npeople also feel a lot less\nmotivated than they would like.\nNow, here the question\nwas, specifically,\nabout how to not go from\nthese extremes of days\nor weeks of high\nmotivation to days\nor weeks of low motivation.\nBut before we do that, we\nneed to take a step back\nand acknowledge that, just as\nwith anxiety, or happiness,\nor sadness, we as human beings\ndon't have an objective window\ninto how other people\nexperience motivation.\nIn fact, most of the\ntime, we don't even\nrealize how we\nexperience motivation.\nWe just know whether\nor not we feel\na high barrier or a low\nbarrier to leaning into work\nand getting things done.\nIn fact, I have\na good friend who\ndid many years in the\nspecial operations community,\nand then went on to\nthe finance community,\nand then now works in health\nand wellness community.\nHe has a great mental image\nfor all of us to adopt.\nIt's certainly one that\nI've adopted, which is--\nfor anything in our\nlife, we can either\nbe back on our heels,\nflat footed, or forward\ncenter of mass.\nBack in our heels, meaning\nreally struggling; flat footed,\nmeaning we're doing OK;\nor forward center of mass,\nmeaning that we feel as if\nwe're really tackling things\nand that we are in\ncontrol of our environment\nor at least to some degree.\nSo I place that\nimagery in your mind\nbecause I'll return to\nit a little bit later\nin the question when\nwe get into some\nof the underlying\ncircuitry and tools.\nIn the meantime, I want\nto remind everybody what\nthe basis of motivation is.\nThere are many neurochemicals\nand neural circuits involved\nin what we call motivation,\nbut a central theme\nof the neuroscience\nof motivation\nis that the neural modulator\ndopamine is involved.\nNow, dopamine does other things\nbesides control motivation.\nIn fact, it controls\nlight adaptation\nin the retina, that is your eye.\nIt controls a number\nof different things\nin terms of movement.\nIt controls all sorts of things,\nbut it is strongly related\nto the motivation pathways.\nHow do we know that?\nWell, there are experiments\non animals and humans, which\nshow that even in the\nabsence of dopamine,\nor in the presence of very\nlow dopamine, I should say,\npeople and animals can\nstill experience pleasure.\nHowever, when dopamine\nlevels are too low,\npeople's ability\nto pursue pleasure,\nor their willingness to pursue\npleasure, in particular,\ntheir willingness to undergo\neffort to pursue pleasure\nor any goal of any\nkind, not just pleasure,\nany goal of any\nkind, is strongly\nregulated by the\nlevels of dopamine.\nSo if dopamine\nlevels are too low,\npeople simply will\nnot put in the effort\nto obtain or reach a goal.\nIf dopamine levels\nare adequately high,\nthey will put in that effort.\nAnd if dopamine\nlevels go too high,\nyou actually see something\nthat is pathologic,\nwhich is that people consider\nevery goal a reasonable goal.\nThis is often seen in the\nmanic phase of a manic bipolar\nperson.\nSo for instance, somebody\nwith manic bipolar\nwho is in a manic\nepisode, dopamine levels\nare very, very high,\nand they will think\nevery idea is a great idea.\nAnd they will have tons\nof energy to do that,\nso much so so that\nthey're not sleeping.\nSo obviously, that's\nnot what we want.\nWhat we want, and what the\nquestion asker, Martin,\nis asking about, is how to keep\ndopamine levels in a range that\nallow us to lean into effort\nbut that we don't expend\nour ability to stay motivated.\nAnd we can really\ntrace that back\nto a biochemical/neural\ncircuit statement, which\nis-- we really want to\ncontrol our output of dopamine\nand the baseline\nlevels of dopamine\nfrom which that output is taken.\nIn other words, we want to think\nabout dopamine as a reservoir\nor residing in a reservoir.\nThat reservoir can be\ndepleted, so it's exhaustible,\nit's depletable, but\nit's renewable as well.\nAnd one of the best analogies\nthat I've ever heard\nwas by a previous guest on the\nHuberman Lab podcast, Dr. Kyle\nGillett, who's a medical doctor,\nobesity specialist, expert\nin hormones.\nWe did an episode on\noptimizing hormones\nin males with Dr. Kyle Gillett.\nYou can find that at\nhubermanlab.com or anywhere\nyou can find podcasts.\nDr. Gillett offered an\nanalogy of the baseline levels\nof dopamine as a wave pool,\nand I really like this.\nSo if you think about this pool\nfull of dopamine-- and here\nwe're just talking\nabout the dopamine\nthat resides in the\ncircuits of the brain that\ncontrol motivation.\nBut that pool of dopamine\nyou could imagine\nis just sitting there not\ndoing much of anything\nwhile you're asleep.\nIn fact, while you're\nsleeping, you're\nreplenishing those\ndopamine levels.\nI'll tell you another\ntool in a moment\nto replenish those\ndopamine levels.\nBut if you were\nto pursue a goal,\nreally, really go\nforward-center of mass\nfor many, many hours or many,\nmany days, in some cases,\nand pursue a goal\nor multiple goals\nand you're really driven to do\na ton, what you're effectively\ndoing is generating\nwaves in that wave pool.\nAnd if those waves\nare too big, well,\nthen the waves can't keep\nrepeating themselves.\nSo think about the\nwave as the motivation\nand the depth of the pool is\nthe reservoir of dopamine.\nAnd if those waves are too\nbig, too much excitement, too\nmuch motivation, too\nmuch center of mass\nfor a given period of time,\nthen the water in this wave pool\nsloshes out of the wave\npool lowering the reservoir.\nAnd then there are\nreally three ways\nthat you can replenish\nthat reservoir,\nand you want to maintain\nor replenish that reservoir\nif it's been depleted.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, first of\nall, quality sleep.\nSo when I say\nquality, I mean where\nyou're getting enough slow\nwave sleep and rapid I\nmove in sleep.\nSo for some people, six hours,\nfor some people, eight hours.\nSome people might even\nneed a little bit more\nor a little bit less.\nWe have episodes-- the\nPerfect Your Sleep episode,\nthe Master Your Sleep episode.\nWe have a toolkit for sleep.\nAll available at zero\ncost at hubermanlab.com,\nlinks et cetera.\nSo check those out for\ngetting your sleep right.\nBut sleep is really\nwhen you replenish\nthat reservoir of dopamine.\nSo you cannot ignore sleep.\nI'll come back to\nthis in a moment.\nThe second science\nsupported tool\nthat's really been\nshown to replenish\ndopamine, in particular,\ndopamine within the pathways\nthat regulate motivation, is\na practice I've talked about\nbefore on the podcast\ncalled non-sleep deep rest,\nsometimes called yoga nidra,\nalthough, yoga nidra is\na little bit different.\nThere are two studies\nout of Denmark\nthat have explored yoga nidra\nin the context of dopamine.\nThe first one simply involved\nhaving people do a yoga nidra\npractice.\nAgain, this doesn't\ninvolve any movement,\nbut it involves people,\npotentially you,\ndoing anywhere from 30 to 60\nminutes, although there are now\ndata showing that as\nshort as 10 minutes\nof a non-sleep deep rest,\na.k.a. yoga nidra protocol,\nleads to dramatic,\nreally dramatic increases\nin striatal dopamine reserves.\nSo it essentially\nis replenishing\nthe dopamine reserve pool.\nThis is why I'm such a\nfan of using NSDR, a.k.a.\nyoga nidra, at least once a\nday and especially under times\nwhen you're engaging in\na lot of high output.\nAnd when I say,\nespecially at times\nwhen you're engaging in\na lot of high output,\nthis is a mistake\nmany people make.\nThey push, push,\npush, push, push.\nThey're in pursuit of a goal.\nThen they hit that point\nwhere they're exhausted.\nThen they start doing\nall the dopamine reserve\npool replenishing tools\nsuch as yoga nidra or NSDR.\nThe real key is\nto always tap off\nthat or refill that\nreservoir once a day\nbefore it's completely depleted.\nNow, this gets into some of\nthe biochemistry of dopamine\nand the relevant circuits,\nbut it takes a lot longer\nto restore the\ndopamine reservoir--\nthink of it still\nas a wave pool,\nbut that reservoir from a\nplace of complete depletion\nthen it does of\npartial depletion.\nSo there's an asymmetry\nin the way this is done.\nSo it's not as if you\ndrink a glass of water.\nYou fill the glass of\nwater at a certain rate\nand it fills up to\na certain level,\nand the rate is constant.\nThink about it as once the level\nof dopamine in your reserve\nis depleted past\na certain point,\nit takes a lot more effort,\nmuch more sleep, much more NSDR,\nthings of that sort to\nreplenish that reservoir.\nNow, oftentimes\nwhat people will do\nwhen they start\nfeeling less motivation\nis they will start relying\non things like Adderall,\nRitalin, some cases\nillegal substances that\ncan increase dopamine.\nYou know what those are.\nPlease don't ever\nlean in to those.\nThey are extremely dangerous.\nThey really are because\nof their ability\nto potently release dopamine.\nAnd guess what, deplete\nthat reservoir even further.\nWe've talked about\nsome supplements\non the podcast that\ncan replenish dopamine,\nL-tyrosine in particular.\nMucuna pruriens is\nactually 99% l-DOPA,\nthe precursor to dopamine.\nI don't necessarily\nrecommend Mucuna pruriens.\nIt tends to make people\nvery dopaminergic--\ndrive, drive, drive, drive,\nmotivated, and then crash.\nAgain, depleting that pool.\nL-tyrosine is a\nlittle bit milder.\nBut I really encourage\npeople to lean first\non the behavioral\ntools such as an NSDR.\nAnd by the way, there's a NSDR\nscript, totally zero cost,\nthat you can find by putting\nmy name and NSDR into YouTube.\nThat one works quite well if you\nare looking for a short NSDR.\nThere are some other NSDRs.\nYou can simply look on\nthe internet or YouTube\nand just put NSDR\nand you'll find NSDR.\nOr if you prefer to do\nthe more classic yoga\nnidra type approach, there are\na lot of different yoga nidra\noptions to choose\nfrom on YouTube.\nMany people think NSDR\nor yoga nidra are simply\nmeditation with a body scan.\nThat's not true.\nMeditation is a focus exercise.\nMost meditations\nare focus exercise.\nNSDR restores energy\nthrough the dopamine system,\nand newer data are\nstarting to show\nthat it can actually\nrecover lost sleep,\nso if you're not\nsleeping enough.\nBut to return to NSDR, a.k.a.\nyoga nidra, as a practice,\nyes, it's been shown in\nlaboratory studies, in humans,\nby the way, to restore\ndopamine levels.\nThere's another\nstudy, lesser known,\nfrom that same group that\nwas published in 2011,\nwhich is entitled Dopaminergic\nstimulation enhances confidence\nand accuracy in seeing\nrapidly presented words.\nThis was a cognitive task.\nThey explored yoga nedra, a.k.a.\nNSDR, in the context of\nincreasing striatal dopamine.\nThey already knew that it\ndid that, so that's great.\nThey confirmed that result.\nBut what they also found\nis that doing NSDR could restore\nconfidence in cognitive ability\nand performance in\nthese cognitive tasks.\nSo this is a really\npowerful, zero cost\ntool for re-upping\nor replenishing\nthat dopamine reserve.\nSo this is something to do every\nday, especially when you're not\nfeeling depleted.\nSo the question,\nagain, was about how\nto make sure that you don't\ngo through these cycles\nof extreme motivation and\nthen lesser motivation.\nWell, get your sleep right.\nI always say, 80% or more\nof the nights of your life,\nhopefully the nights that it's\nnot good, are for good reasons\nthat you're enjoying yourself.\nBut hey, life happens,\nso 100% of the time\nit's just not reasonable\nto expect of yourself.\nDo NSDR once a day\nfor either 10 minutes.\nIf you have the time to do\n20-30 minutes or an hour,\nyou will see even\nmore positive effects.\nIt has been shown in\nthese research studies\nto replenish dopamine,\nlevels of confidence,\ncognitive ability, et cetera,\nand sense of motivation.\nAnd I said there\nwere three tools,\nand the third tool\nthat really can\nallow you to keep the\ndopamine, a.k.a. motivation\ncircuitry, tuned up\nproperly is to really start\npaying attention to\npeaks in dopamine\nand be very careful\nabout layering\nin too many things that can\nstimulate the dopamine system.\nI talked about this quite\na bit in the episode\nthat we did on ADHD and\nbuilding and maintaining focus.\nThere are many things\nout there nowadays\nthat will deplete\nthe dopamine system.\nFor instance-- and by the way,\nnone of what I'm about to list\nis necessarily bad.\nI actually used some\nof these things.\nFor instance, caffeine will\nincrease dopamine receptors\nthat will allow\nwhatever dopamine\nis available to be more potent.\nOK, so caffeine is\ngreat for some people,\nless good for\npeople with anxiety.\nDon't drink it too\nlate in the day\nbecause it will interfere\nwith your sleep,\nand so on and so forth.\nBut many people will\ncombine caffeine with music\nthat they particularly like.\nMusic's great.\nMusic can stimulate dopamine\nrelease, we know this.\nIt can enhance\nmotivation, especially\nif is the kind of music\nthat really puts you\nin the groove for the\nparticular type of work\nyou're going to do.\nFor me, I like to listen to\neither loud fast music or Glenn\nGould classical piano,\nso one or the other.\nI know what's right for\nme for a given time.\nYou'll know what's right\nfor you for a given\ntime and your preferences.\nBut what will happen is people\nwill start consuming caffeine\nat higher and higher levels.\nAgain, caffeine isn't\nnecessarily bad,\nbut they'll start doing that.\nAnd they'll start layering\nit in, or stacking,\nvery potent music,\npotent for them,\nplus things like L-tyrosine.\nAgain, none of these things\nare terrible on their own.\nIn fact, they can\nbe very beneficial.\nSometimes they'll start\ntaking Mucuna pruriens.\nSometimes they'll\nstart relying on things\nlike Adderall, Ritalin.\nAnd pretty soon\nwhat's happening is\nthey're getting these big waves\nin that dopamine wave pool,\nbig peaks.\nAnd within a few days or\nmaybe even within a few hours,\nthey're depleted and\nthey're at that low.\nAnd then, as Dr.\nAnna Lembke, who\nis a guest on the podcast,\ntalked about in terms\nof addiction but also in\nher wonderful book Dopamine\nNation, what happens is after\nthose big peaks in dopamine,\nthe reservoir, the\nbaseline in dopamine,\ndrops below its initial level.\nSo it's as if the reservoir\ngot deeper, and it's emptier,\nand it takes much,\nmuch longer to fill.\nSo to be quite specific,\nwhat I'm recommending\nis get your sleep right.\nIdeally, every night of\nyour life, but for as\nmany nights of your\nlife as possible.\nThat's clearly replenishing\ndopamine and sense\nof motivation.\nDo all the things associated\nwith that-- morning, sunlight,\nlack of artificial\nlight at certain hours\nof the night, et cetera.\nAll of that's in the Toolkit\nfor Sleep and other episodes\nI mentioned before.\nHave a practice that\nis research supported\nto replenish dopamine,\nand incorporate\nthat practice any time of day.\nAgain, NSDR can be done\nmorning, afternoon, or evening,\nor middle of the\nnight if you wake up\nand you need to\nget back to sleep,\nit can be very\nbeneficial for that.\nBut do it as a\nconsistent practice\nso that dopamine reservoir\nremains tapped off.\nAnd as a third point, please be\nwary of, or at least aware of,\nthese peaks in\ndopamine and the fact\nthat layering in a lot of things\nthat stimulate dopamine, well,\nthat can be wonderful for your\nwedding, birth of a new child,\ngoing to a sports event\nwith a bunch of friends,\ncelebrating a big anniversary.\nYes, please do\ncelebrate and enjoy\nthe wonderful events of life,\nbut please also understand\nand expect there will be a\nlull, a sort of postpartum low,\nmaybe not full blown\ndepression, that\nfollows that unless\nyou incorporate\nsome tools and practices\nto replenish that dopamine.\nDoes that mean you should never\ncombine caffeine, L-tyrosine,\nmusic, and a workout,\nand time with friends?\nNo, absolutely not.\nBut don't expect to\ndo that, and then\ngo do an intense bout\nof work, and then get up\nthe next morning and do\nit all over again for more\nthan a few days before you\nfind yourself pretty depleted.\nSo rather than give\nyou a specific schedule\nof do seven days of this\nand four days of this, what\nI encourage you to do is, for at\nleast five days a week-- maybe\ngive yourself some time off\non the weekends, maybe not.\nBut for at least\nfive days a week,\nget into a consistent\nroutine that\nis, I should say,\nneurobiologically consistent as\nwell with how the\ndopamine, a.k.a.\ncircuits that control\nmotivation, work.\nAnd I assure you that\nyou will find yourself\nin a more regular groove\nof focus, and attention,\nand alertness, and\nmotivation when you need to.\nAnd provided you're\ndoing all the things\nI described, and\nhopefully paying attention\nto other things like nutrition\nand social connection too,\nof course, you'll find a much\nmore even pattern of motivation\nover time.\nOne last thing before I conclude\nthe answer to this question.\nWhen I was in graduate school,\nI got some wonderful advice\nfrom an excellent neurologist.\nHis name is Robert Knight.\nHe used to be at University\nof California, Berkeley.\nI think he's retired\nnow but is still\nactive in the\nscientific community.\nAnd I asked him what he\nwas doing that weekend.\nI don't know why this came up.\nAnd he said, oh,\nI'm going fishing.\nI like mindless recreation.\nI said, that's great.\nYou know, fishing is fun.\nI'm not particularly\ninto fishing myself,\nbut I've done it a few\ntimes and I enjoy it.\nAnd he said, the most important\nthing for a science or medicine\ncareer or any demanding career?\nI said, what?\nI was all ears, super\nhungry to get in the mix\nand do research\nand publish papers.\nAnd he said, figure out\nhow many hours a day you\ncan do real work consistently.\nThat means five days a week,\nfor some people six or seven,\nbut five days a week I\nthink for most people\nis going to be a bit healthier\noverall for your social life\nand family, et cetera.\nAnd he said, figure\nthat out, and know\nthat that number is what you\nshould apply over, and over,\nand over again, but update that\nnumber about every four or five\nyears.\nAnd I said, OK, so does that\nmean that over time I'm working\nmore and more or less and less?\nAnd he said, ah, here's the\ndeal-- as you get better\nat your profession,\nyou will find\nthat you can do more potent\nwork, more directed work,\nin a shorter amount\nof time, but that\ndoes not mean that\nyou can continue\nto expand the amount of time\nthat you're doing focused work.\nIn fact, the opposite.\nSo this follows a sort\nof general principle\nthat's also present in\nresistance training,\nweightlifting, right?\nThe analogy there is\nthat people always\nimagine that as you get better\nand better at resistance\ntraining that you should\ndo more and more volume,\njust keep adding volume.\nAnd there's some\nevidence to support that.\nMore volume for hypertrophy\nas opposed to less, et cetera.\nWe've done episodes on this.\nHowever, there's a\ndifferent school of thought\nthat works exceedingly\nwell, and it\nruns in the exact\nopposite direction,\nwhich is as you get better\nat controlling muscular\ncontractions--\nor let's say for in\nan endurance sport,\nas you get better at regulating\nyour stride, and breathing,\nand all those\nthings, you actually\ncan do more \"adaptation\"\nstimulating damage\nduring a given training session.\nSo you want to train\nless not more over time\nbecause beginners don't\nactually have the ability\nto get much done in a lot of\ntime or a short period of time,\nwhereas, experts can come\nin there and really nail it.\nSo I think that advice that\nRobert Knight was really key,\nand it's something that I've\nfollowed throughout my career.\nSo at one period of my life,\nI won't mention the hours\nthat I worked in\ngraduate school,\nthey were pretty\ninsane to be honest.\nI had family members\nget a little concerned.\nI actually lived\nin the laboratory\neven as a junior professor.\nI don't suggest people\ndo that by the way,\nbut I enjoyed it at the time.\nAnd the key thing is\nthat you figure out\nwhat you can do consistently\nand still maintain mental health\nand physical health.\nThat's key as well.\nAnd do that, and then,\nevery couple of years or so,\nupdate that,\ntypically, by reducing\nthe total amount\nof time that you're\ndoing that high-potency work.\nI think that, combined\nwith the other tools\nthat I described\nbefore for generating\nongoing dopaminergic circuits,\nkeeping that reservoir full,\nought to give you\nconsistent motivation.\nAgain, it's an art, and a\npractice, and a science,\nso don't expect to get it\nperfect the first time around.\nBut I wish you all luck, and I'm\ncertain that these tools work.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning of this\nask me anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nask me anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel,\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which,\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research.\nIn particular, research done\non human beings, so not animal\nmodels but on\nhuman beings, which\nI think we all\nagree as a species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels.\nNot just the premium channel\nbut through all channels--\nHuberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the kind\nof research that\nprovides those kinds of\nanswers in the first place.\nNow, and especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the tiny\nfoundation has generously\noffered to do dollar-for-dollar\nmatch on all funds raised\nfor research through\nthe premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab premium channel,\nagain, there's a cost\nof $10 per month,\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire year.\nThat will give you\naccess to all the AMA's.\nYou can ask questions and get\nanswers to your questions,\nand you'll, of course, get\nanswers to all the questions\nthat other people ask as well.\nThere will also be some premium\ncontent such as transcripts\nof the AMA's and various\ntranscripts and protocols\nof Huberman lab podcast\nepisodes not found elsewhere.\nAnd again, you'll be\nsupporting research\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nYou can sign up for the\npremium channel by going\nto hubermanlab.com/premium.\nAgain, that's\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
