    "transcript": "I have heard that a\nshort walk after a meal\nwill reduce blood glucose in\na way that's really dramatic.\nHuge amount.\n30-35%, just taking a walk\naround the block after a meal.\nThat's definitely a prescription, I think,\neveryone should do, 'cause the\nresearch is so strong on it\nis that building in simply a\n10-minute walk around the block\nor a dance party in the kitchen,\nmoving your muscles for\n10 minutes after a meal\ncan drastically reduce\nyour glucose response,\n'cause you're just\nbringing all those channels\nto the membrane,\nyou're taking up the\nglucose, you're using it.\nIt's a whole different physiology\nthan sitting on the couch after a meal.\nThat's very high impact.\nIt's high leverage if it's after a meal.\nSo highly recommend that.\nAnd the Levels data and\nclinical data has shown that out\ntime and time again."
