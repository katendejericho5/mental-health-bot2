    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof nNeurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Gina Poe.\nDr. Gina Poe is a professor in\nthe Department of Integrative\nBiology and Physiology at the\nUniversity of California Los\nAngeles.\nHer laboratory and research\nfocuses on the relationship\nbetween sleep and\nlearning, in particular\nhow specific patterns\nof brain activity that\nare present during\nspecific phases of sleep\nimpact our ability\nto learn and remember\nspecific types of information.\nFor instance, procedural\ninformation-- that\nis how to perform specific\ncognitive or physical tasks,\nas well as encoding\nof emotional memories\nand discarding\nemotional memories.\nIndeed, her research focuses\non how specific phases of sleep\ncan act as its own\nform of trauma therapy,\ndiscarding the emotional\ntones of memories.\nIn addition, her\nlaboratory focuses\non how specific phases\nof sleep impact things\nlike the release\nof growth hormone.\nGrowth hormone, of course,\nplays critical roles\nin metabolism and tissue repair,\nincluding brain tissue repair,\nand therefore has critical\nroles in vitality and longevity.\nToday you will learn many\nthings about the relationship\nbetween sleep, learning,\nemotionality, and growth\nhormone.\nOne basic but very\nimportant takeaway\nthat you'll learn about\ntoday, which was news to me,\nis that it's not\njust the duration\nand depth of your\nsleep that matter,\nbut actually getting to sleep\nat relatively the same time\neach night ensures that you get\nadequate growth hormone release\nin the first hours of sleep.\nIn fact, if you require, let's\nsay, eight hours of sleep\nper night, but you go\nto sleep two hours later\nthan your typical bedtime\non any given night,\nyou actually miss the window\nfor growth hormone release.\nThat's right.\nGetting growth hormone\nrelease in sleep,\nwhich is absolutely critical\nto our immediate and long term\nhealth, is not a prerequisite\nof getting sleep,\neven if we are\ngetting enough sleep.\nAs Dr. Poe explains, there\nare critical brain circuits\nand endocrine, that\nis hormone, circuits\nthat regulate not just the\nduration and depth and quality\nand timing of sleep,\nbut when we place\nour bout of sleep, that is\nwhen we go to sleep each night,\nplus or minus about\na half hour or so,\nstrongly dictates\nwhether or not we\nwill experience all the health\npromoting, including mind\npromoting, benefits of sleep.\nToday's episode covers\nthat and a lot more\nin substantial detail.\nYou will learn,\nfor instance, how\nto use sleep in order to\noptimize learning, as well\nas forgetting, for those things\nthat you would like to forget.\nSo during today's\nepisode, Dr. Gina Poe\nshares critical information\nabout not just neuroscience,\nbut physiology and\nthe hormone systems\nof the brain and\nbody that strongly\ninform mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nSo by the end of\ntoday's episode,\nyou'll be far more informed\nabout sleep and how it works,\nthe different roles it\nperforms, and you'll\nhave several new\nactionable steps\nthat you can take\nin order to improve\nyour mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand nothing you don't.\nThat means plenty of salt,\nmagnesium, and potassium,\nthe so-called\nelectrolytes, and no sugar.\nThe electrolytes are\ncritical to the function\nof every cell in your\nbody, in particular,\nthe neurons, the nerve cells.\nSo I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast,\nneurons, nerve cells, require\nadequate sodium and potassium,\nas well as magnesium,\nin order to fire\naction potentials, which are\nthe electrical signals that\nallow neurons to do\neverything from generate focus\nand attention, allow you\nto learn, and generate\nneuromuscular connection,\nand allow you to exercise\nor train or do any kind\nof skilled activity\nwith a high degree of output.\nI take LMNT about two\nor three times per day,\ntypically once in\nthe morning and again\nafter or during my bout\nof exercise each day\nand sometimes an\nadditional one if I've\nsat in a hot sauna\nand sweat a lot\nor if the weather is very hot.\nIf you'd like to\ntry LMNT, you can go\nto drinklmnt.com/huberman to\nclaim a free LMNT sample pack\nwith your purchase.\nAgain, that's\ndrinklmnt.com/huberman to claim\na free sample pack.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes\nmattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nNow, sleep is the foundation of\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nWhen we are sleeping\nwell, all of those things\nexcel, and when we\nare not sleeping well,\nall of those things suffer.\nNow, the surface\nthat you sleep on,\nthat is the mattress that\nyou sleep on, is critical,\nand Helix understands\nthat everybody has\nslightly different sleep needs.\nSo if you were to go to the\nHelix site, which I invite you\nto do, and take their\nbrief two minute quiz,\nit will match your body\ntype and sleep preferences\nto the perfect mattress for you.\nIt will ask you questions.\nFor instance, do you sleep\non your back or your side\nor your stomach?\nDo you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?\nOr maybe you don't know the\nanswers to those questions.\nI went and took the\nsleep quiz at Helix,\nand it matched me to the\nso-called Dusk Mattress--\nD-U-S-K. I started sleeping on\nDusk Mattress over a year ago,\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nIt's completely transformed the\ndepth and duration and quality\nof my sleep in ways\nthat make me feel\nfar better during the daytime.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\nyou can go to\nhelixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two\nminute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress.\nAnd you'll get up to $350 off\nany mattress order and two\nfree pillows.\nAgain, if interested, go to\nhelixsleep.com/huberman for up\nto $350 off and\ntwo free pillows.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nNow, again, sleep\nis the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nBut what many\npeople don't realize\nis that in order to\nfall and stay asleep,\nyour core body\ntemperature has to drop\nby about one to three degrees.\nConversely, in order\nto wake up each morning\nand feel refreshed,\nyour body temperature\nactually has to increase\nby one to three degrees.\nTherefore, controlling the\ntemperature of your sleeping\nenvironment is absolutely key.\nWith Eight Sleep,\nthat's very easy to do.\nDepending on whether\nor not you typically\nrun too cold or too\nhot during the night,\nyou can program\nyour sleep mattress\ncover so that it's the optimal\ntemperature not just for you,\nbut for each phase--\nthe early, middle, and\nlate phase of your sleep--\nand for waking up\nin the morning.\nIn fact, you can even control\nthe temperature of your sleep\nmattress cover differentially\nacross the mattress\nif you're sleeping\nalongside somebody else.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman\nand check out their Pod\nPro cover and save $150\nat checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nin the USA, Canada, UK,\nand select countries in\nthe EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\n$150 at checkout.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous Supplements.\nTo find the supplements we\ndiscuss on the Huberman Lab\npodcast, you can go to\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just\nmentioned that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Gina Poe.\nDr. Gina Poe, welcome.\nGINA POE: Thank you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I've\nreally been looking forward\nto this conversation because\nI'm familiar with your work,\nand I know that many\npeople are going\nto be excited to\nlearn about your work\nas it relates to\nsleep, as it relates\nto problem solving, creativity,\naddiction and craving, relapse,\nand a number of other\nimportant topics.\nSo to start things\noff, I would love\nfor you to educate us\na bit about this thing\nthat we are all familiar\nwith and yet very few of us\nunderstand, which is sleep.\nAnd if you would, could you\ndescribe the various phases\nof sleep that exist?\nWhat distinguish them?\nAnd perhaps frame this\nwithin the context\nof what would a perfect\nnight's sleep look like?\nGINA POE: OK.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How long\nwould it last, more or less,\nand what would the\nbiology look like?\nWhat is a perfect night's sleep?\nGINA POE: Yeah, that's\na great question.\nAll right.\nSo sleep is really\ndifferent from wakefulness,\nand in fact can't be replaced\nby any state of wakefulness\nthat we've been able\nto come up with so far.\nOur brain chemistry is\ncompletely different.\nAnd in the different\nstages of sleep,\nwhich there is non-REM and\nREM are the two major states\nof sleep, and every animal\nwe've studied so far\nseems to have both\nof those states.\nAnyway, those two states are\nentirely different from one\nanother, too.\nAnd even within non-REM,\nthere are three states.\nStage one, which is what\nyou slip into when you first\nfalling asleep-- it's dozing.\nThere's kind of an\ninteresting rhythm\nthat goes on in the brain.\nIt's kind of a\nfast, gamma rhythm.\nAnd then there's\nstage two, which\nis a really cool state we\nsort of used to ignore,\nsleep researchers, because\nit was a transient state\nbetween wakefulness\nand the deep stage\nthree, slow wave sleep, which\nis the most impressively\ndifferent.\nAnd between that and REM sleep.\nSo stage two, I'll talk\na little bit more about.\nAnd then the deep,\nslow wave sleep state,\nwhich is when big, slow waves\nsweep through our brain.\nAnd now we realize that\nit cleans our brain.\nOne of the things that\nthose big, slow waves do\nis cleans our brain and does\nother really important things\nto restore us from a\nday of wakefulness.\nAnd then REM sleep,\nwhich is the most popular\nbecause that's where we\nhave the most active dreams.\nAnd when you wake up\nsomeone out of REM sleep,\nthey'll almost always\nreport having dreamed\nsomething really bizarre.\nThat's called REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nSo those are the four states\nof sleep, of human sleep,\nand we cycle through them\nevery 90 minutes or so.\nWhen we go to sleep,\nsay 10:30, 11:00,\nour first REM sleep period\ncomes about 105 minutes\nafter we fall asleep and\nlasts about 20 minutes.\nActually, it comes\nabout 95 minutes\nand lasts 10 or 15 minutes.\nAnd then we start over again.\nAnd we have about five of those\nper night for a perfect night's\nsleep--\nfour or five,\nsomething like that.\nSo a perfect night's sleep is\nseven and a half, eight hours.\nThere was a really\ngreat study that\nput people in a semi-darkened\nroom with nothing\nbut the bed for 12 hours\nevery day for a month.\nAnd what people did\ninitially, because we're\nin a sleep deprived\nnation, is that they\nslept a lot more than usual,\nlike 10 or 11 hours of the 12.\nAnd then they leveled\noff after a week or two\nto about eight hours\nand 15 minutes of sleep.\nSo you actually can't oversleep.\nI mean, they had nothing\nelse to do but sleep,\nand they would round off to\nan average eight hours and 15\nminutes a night and then spend\nthe rest of the time twiddling\ntheir thumbs, humming tunes--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nGINA POE: --daydreaming.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI want to get back\nto the contour of a\nperfect night's sleep,\nbut I'm intrigued by this idea\nthat people can't oversleep.\nI'm often asked whether or\nnot we can get too much sleep\nand whether or not sleeping\ntoo long can make us groggy\nthe next day.\nIs there anything to that?\nAnd how does one\ndetermine how long\nthey should sleep on average?\nGINA POE: On average, yeah.\nWell, that's interesting\nbecause different people seem\nto need different\namounts of sleep,\nbut we don't really even know\nexactly what sleep is for.\nSo what they need is kind of--\nit's murky.\nSo we do know a lot of things\nthat sleep does now for us,\nbut we don't know how\nlong those things take.\nSo how long we need to sleep is\nalso just a big question mark.\nBut some people\ndon't feel rested\nuntil they've slept nine hours.\nSome people don't feel rested\nafter three or four and a half.\nBut most people, if they\nconsistently deprive themselves\nof sleep so that\nthey're only sleeping\nfor four and a\nhalf hours a night,\nbuild up a cognitive deficit\nthat just builds up over time.\nThe more nights you have with\nsleep deprivation, the more\ncognitive deficit you have.\nAnd so you need sleep, again,\nto sleep more to recover.\nNow, the question\nyou had about um--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nCan you oversleep--\nGINA POE: Can you\noversleep, right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can\nyou sleep to the point\nwhere it's too much?\nYou know, growing up,\nwhen I was in high school,\nmy girlfriend's\ndad had this belief\nthat no one should\nsleep in past 6:00 AM.\nSo he would wake all the--\nthere were two\nchildren in the home.\nHe would wake up the\nkids in that house.\nHe had this thing\nagainst oversleeping,\nregardless of when\npeople went to sleep,\nand I always thought that\nwas an interesting mentality.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nIt's not terrible, actually,\nbecause what that will do\nis it will make you\nsleepier the next night\nto get to bed on time.\nSo it'll build up\nyour homeostatic need\nif you wake up too early.\nBut so I don't think\nyou can oversleep.\nBut people who sleep\na lot, like people\nwho sleep over nine\nhours, it's probably\nindicative of some other\nproblem because in fact,\nif you have a lot of\ndifferent conditions,\nit will cause you\nto sleep a lot more.\nProbably because\nwhat it does is it\ninterferes with your\nefficient sleep,\nthe efficiency of your sleep.\nSo if you find yourself\nsleeping consistently nine hours\nplus every night,\nthen you might want\nto consult a doctor about\nmaybe what else it might be.\nIt could be cancer.\nIt could be sleep apnea,\nwhich affects a lot of people.\nIt could be that your\nsleep is super inefficient\nbecause you're snoring a\nlot more than you know,\nor you're waking up a lot more\nthan you know every night.\nSo you might want\na sleep study just\nto see how your\nsleep is, and then\nsee what else might be\ncausing you to sleep so much.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd that wouldn't\nbe if somebody is\nsleeping nine or 10\nhours every once in a while.\nYou mean if they're\nconsistently sleeping\nfor more than nine hours.\nGINA POE: If they feel\nlike they need it in order\nto function cognitively\nthe next day,\nit might be that your sleep\nis just not efficient,\nand you might want to look\ninto why that's the case.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nForgive me for the anecdote,\nbut I can't resist.\nYears ago I went to\nan acupuncturist,\nand he gave me these\nred pills, of which I\ndon't know what they contained.\nGINA POE: Uh-oh.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I took\nthem because he told me\nthey would help with my sleep.\nGINA POE: OK.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nI would fall asleep\nabout 30 minutes\nafter taking them,\nand I would have\nincredibly vivid dreams.\nAnd I'd wake up\nfour or five hours\nafter having gone to sleep\nfeeling completely rested,\nsomething that I've\nnever really experienced\non a consistent basis.\nI want to do mass\nspec on these pills.\nI still have no idea what\nwas in them, whatsoever.\nGINA POE: I want to do mass\nspec on those pills, too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, exactly.\nSome people thought perhaps they\nhad GHB, gamma hydroxybutyrate,\nwhich is, by the\nway, an illegal drug.\nIt can kill you.\nIt's not something\nyou want to take.\nGINA POE: No, that's not good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But anyway,\nif ever someone can figure out\nwhat the red pills\nwere, I'll be very--\nGINA POE: That's really great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And this is\nnot a red pill of the other sort\nred pill.\nThis is just the\nred sleep pills.\nGINA POE: Interesting.\nI mean, it could have\nbeen even a placebo effect\nbecause placebo is\nextremely strong.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAlthough, I don't know.\nThere was really something\nto these red pills.\nSo shout out to\nthe acupuncturists\nin Eastern medicine.\nBut to return this to this\nidea of the architecture\nof a perfect night's sleep.\nSo you said we fall asleep.\nThe first 90 minutes of sleep.\nREM sleep, rapid\neye movement sleep,\nwill arrive at\nabout 95 minutes in.\nDoes that mean that the\nrest of that 90 minutes\nis consumed with\nslow wave sleep?\nGINA POE: Yeah, non-REM sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nAnd what about the sleep\nwhere we are lightly asleep,\nand we might have a\ndream that has us somehow\nthinking about movement or\nthat we jolt ourselves awake?\nThat often happens early\nin the night, right?\nGINA POE: Yeah, that's\nthe first stage--\nstage one and\nstage two of sleep.\nAnd stage two sleep\nis really cool\nbecause that has something\ncalled sleep spindles\nand K-complexes.\nAnd what sleep spindles are are\na little bit of activity that's\n10 to 15 hertz in frequency.\nIt's a conversation between\nthe thalamus and the cortex.\nThe thalamus is the\ngateway to consciousness,\nand the neocortex processes\nall our cognition.\nAnd so it's these spindles.\nThey're called sleep spindles.\nAnd if you wake up\nout of that state,\nyou will often report a dream,\nlike a hallucination style\ndream.\nIt won't be a long dream report\nlike you have out of REM sleep,\nbut it will be some\nhallucination state.\nAnd while we're\nfalling asleep, one\nof the reasons we\ncall it falling asleep\nis because in stage\none and stage two\nour muscles are relaxing.\nAnd if there's part of our\nbrain that's conscious enough\nto sort of recognize\nthat relaxation,\nwe'll feel like we're\nfalling, and we'll jerk awake.\nSo often that hallucination--\nit's called hypnagogic\nhallucination-- will feel like--\nit'll include some\nfalling aspect\nthat we'll wake up out of.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nreally interesting to me.\nI've long felt that\nsensation of almost, like,\ndropping back into my head.\nSo much so that if I elevate\nmy feet just slightly\nand I tilt my head back\njust slightly in order\nto go to sleep, I find that\nI fall asleep much faster.\nGINA POE: Interesting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut it does feel\nas if I'm going to\nfall, like, almost going\nto do a backward somersault.\nI actually really like\nthe sensation and\nusually because it\nprecedes falling deeply asleep.\nGINA POE: Yeah, that's\nreally interesting.\nSomebody has to do a study\nof elevated feet and--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, there's\na little bit on body position\nand sleep in some of the\nwashout that we'll talk about.\nSo early in the night you've got\nthese lighter stages of sleep,\nless rapid eye movement sleep.\nWhat can we say about the\ndreams that occur during the,\nsay, first and second\n90-minute cycles of sleep.\nAre they quite different\nthan the patterns\nof sleep and dreaming that\noccur later in the night\nor toward morning?\nGINA POE: Well, OK, that's\nan interesting question,\nand there's a lot\nof facets to it.\nThere is some evidence that\nthe first four hours of sleep\nare very important\nfor memory processing.\nAnd in fact, if you've\nlearned something new that day\nor have experienced a new\nsensory motor experience,\nthen your early\nsleep dreams will\nincorporate that experience\nmuch more than the later sleep\ndreams.\nLater, as that memory\ngets consolidated\nfrom the early\nstructures, which are\nthe hippocampus deep in the\ntemporal lobe to the cortex\nin a distributed\nfashion, that memory\nseems to move from that\nhippocampus to the cortex.\nAnd also the dreams that\nincorporate that memory also\nmove later in the night.\nSo nobody knows\nwhy, but it does.\nThere was a great study\nby Siddhartha Ribeiro\nwho studied the consolidation\nof memories from the hippocampus\nto the cortex in a rat across\nthe period of a full day's\nsleep because rats\nsleep in the daytime.\nAnd he found that each\nsubsequent REM sleep period\nmoved that memory\nfrom the hippocampus\nto the first area\nthat projects to it,\nand then the second area,\nand then the third area.\nAnd you can see the memory\nmoving throughout the sleep\nperiod.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Cool.\nVery cool.\nI have to read that study.\nSo there's a number of\ndifferent hormones associated\nwith the different\nstages of sleep.\nWe know that melatonin\nis a hormone--\nGINA POE: Of nighttime.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --of\nnighttime that makes us sleepy.\nWhat about growth\nhormone release?\nWhen does that\noccur during sleep?\nGINA POE: So growth\nhormone release\nhappens all day long\nand all night long,\nbut the deep, slow\nwave sleep that you\nget the very first\nsleep cycle is\nwhen you get a big bolus\nof growth hormone release,\nin men and women equally.\nAnd if you miss that first\ndeep, slow wave sleep period,\nyou also miss that big bolus\nof growth hormone release.\nAnd you might get, ultimately\nacross the day, just as much\noverall growth hormone\nrelease, but endocrinologists\nwill tell you that big\nboluses do different things\nthan a little bit\neked out over time.\nSo that is what we know.\nThere's also a big push\nto synthesize proteins.\nSo that's when the\nprotein synthesis\npart that builds memories,\nfor example, in our brain\nhappens in that\nfirst cycle of sleep.\nSo you don't want to miss\nthat, especially if you've\nlearned something really big\nand needs more synaptic space\nto encode it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHow would somebody\nmiss that first 90 minutes?\nGINA POE: Sleep\ndepriving themselves.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nlet's say I normally\ngo to sleep at 10:00 PM.\nAnd then from 10:00\nto 11:30 would\nbe this first phase\nof sleep, and that's\nwhen the big bolus of growth\nhormone would be released.\nDoes that mean that\nif I go to sleep\ninstead at 11:30 or\nmidnight that I missed\nthat first phase of sleep?\nWhy is it not the case that I\nget that first phase of sleep\njust simply starting later?\nGINA POE: It is\na beautiful clock\nthat we have in\nour body that knows\nwhen things should happen.\nAnd it's-- every cell\nin our body has a clock.\nAnd all of those clocks\nare normally synchronized.\nAnd those circadian\nclocks are synchronized.\nAnd so our cells are ready to\nrespond to that growth hormone\nrelease at a particular time.\nAnd if we miss it-- and it's a\ntime in relation to melatonin\nalso--\nso if you miss it, yeah, you\nmight get some growth hormone\nrelease.\nBut it's occurring at a time\nwhen your clock has already\nmoved to the next phase.\nAnd so it's just a clock thing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI don't think we can overstate\nthe importance of what you just\ndescribed.\nAnd to be honest,\ndespite knowing a bit\nabout the sleep research\nin circadian biology,\nthis is the very first time\nthat I've ever heard this\nthat if you normally go to sleep\nat a particular time and growth\nhormone is released in\nthat first phase of sleep,\nthat you can't simply\ninitiate your sleep out\nlater and expect to capture\nthat first phase of sleep.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's incredible\nand I think\nimportant and as many\nlisteners are probably realizing\nalso highly actionable.\nSo what this means\nis that we should\nhave fairly consistent\nbedtimes in addition\nto fairly consistent wake times.\nIs that right?\nGINA POE: Exactly.\nAnd in fact, one\nof the best markers\nof good neurological\nhealth when we get older\nis consistent bedtimes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nOK.\nI don't want to backtrack.\nBut I did write down\nsomething that I\nthink is important for me to\nresolve or for you to resolve.\nSo I'm going to ask\nthis people that\nsleep nine hours or more perhaps\nthat reflecting an issue--\nsome underlying\nissue, perhaps, is\nbeing a teenager\nor an adolescent\nand undergoing a\nstage of development\nwhere there's a lot of\nbodily and brain growth\nand exception to that, because--\nGINA POE: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I don't\nrecall sleeping a ton\nwhen I was a teenager.\nI had a ton of energy.\nBut I know a few teenagers.\nAnd they sleep a lot.\nGINA POE: Yeah\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like they'll\njust sleep, and sleep,\nand sleep, and sleep.\nShould we let them sleep,\nand sleep, and sleep?\nGINA POE: Let them sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo that's the one exception.\nWhat about--\nGINA POE: Just like babies.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nGINA POE: When you're developing\nsomething in your brain\nor the rest of your\nbody, you really\nneed sleep to help\norganize that.\nSleep is doing really hard\nwork in organizing our brains\nand making it develop right.\nAnd if we deprive\nourselves of sleep,\nwe will-- actually,\nalso just like I said,\nwe have a daily clock.\nWe also have a\ndevelopmental clock.\nAnd we can miss a\ndevelopmental window\nif we don't let ourselves\nsleep extra like we need to.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What other\nthings inhibit growth hormone\nrelease or other components\nof this first stage of sleep?\nIn other words, if I\ngo to sleep religiously\nevery night at\n10:00 PM, are there\nthings that I, perhaps,\ndo in the preceding\nhours of the preceding day\nlike ingest caffeine or alcohol\nthat can make that\nfirst stage of sleep\nless effective even if I'm\ngoing to sleep at the same time?\nGINA POE: Alcohol definitely\nwill do that because alcohol\nis a REM sleep suppressant.\nAnd it even suppresses\nsome of that stage two\ntransition to REM with\nthose sleep spindles.\nAnd those sleep\nspindles, we didn't\ntalk about their\nfunction yet, but they're\nreally important for moving\nmemories to our cortex.\nIt's a unique time\nwhen our hippocampus,\nlike the RAM of our brains,\nwrites it to a hard disk which\nis the cortex.\nAnd it's a unique time\nwhen they're connected.\nSo if you don't\nwant to miss that,\nyou don't want to miss\nREM sleep when it's also\na part of the consolidation\nprocess and schema changing\nprocess, and alcohol in\nthere before we go to sleep\nwill do that.\nUntil we've metabolized alcohol\nand put it out of our bodies,\nit will affect our sleep badly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nprobably fair to say\nno ingestion of alcohol\nwithin the four to six\nhours preceding sleep?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nGiven the half life?\nGINA POE: Given the half--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or at all--\nor at all would be better.\nBut I know some people\nrefuse to go that way.\nGINA POE: And maybe\na little bit is OK.\nI don't know what\nthe dose response is.\nBut there are studies out\nthere you can look at.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So we're still\nin the first stage of sleep.\nAnd I apologize for\nslowing us down.\nBut it sounds like it's\nan incredibly important,\nfirst phase of sleep.\nWhat about the second and third\n90-minute blocks of sleep?\nIs there anything that\nmakes those unique?\nWhat is their signature\nbesides the fact that they come\nsecond and third in the night?\nGINA POE: There's more\nand more REM sleep\nthe later the night we get.\nThere's also a\nchange in hormones.\nThe growth hormone and melatonin\nlevels are starting to decline.\nBut other hormones\nare picking up.\nSo it is a really\ndifferent stage\nthat you also don't want\nto shortchange yourself on.\nAnd I think that's the stage\nmany studies are showing\nthat those are the\ntimes in sleep when\nthe most creativity can happen.\nThat's when our dreams can\nincorporate and put together\nold and new things\ntogether into a new way.\nAnd our schema are\nbuilt during that time.\nSo yeah, we can\nchange our minds best\nduring those phases of sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you\nelaborate a little bit more\non schema?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No one--\nI don't think anyone\non this podcast\nhas ever discussed schema.\nI'm a little bit\nfamiliar with schema\nfrom my courses on psychology.\nBut it's been a while.\nSo maybe you could just\nrefresh mind and everyone--\nGINA POE: Well, it's\nstill a concept.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.\nGINA POE: Schema--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How do you--\nhow do you define schema?\nGINA POE: Right.\nI think of schema as--\nlike we have a schema\nof Christmas, right?\nWe have all kinds of ideas\nthat were so together\nand called Christmas,\na holiday season.\nIn the northern\nhemisphere, it's cold.\nWe have Santa Claus, and\nreindeer, and jingle bells,\nand even things that are\nfalse but we normally\nassociate with Christmas\npresents, family gathering when\nit is.\nAll of this stuff is\nsewn together into one--\nthere's a thread\nlinking them all.\nAnd we can just give ourselves a\nlist of words, and none of them\ncontain the word Christmas.\nAnd then ask people later,\ngive them another list of words\nand include the word Christmas.\nAnd they'll say, oh,\nyeah, that word was there,\nbecause in their\nminds they brought up\nthat word, Christmas, because\nit's part of that whole schema.\nSo that's what-- it's\nsort of a related--\nlot of related\nconcepts, I guess.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think about\nthe desktop of my computer\nwould scare some people.\nBut it's just a ton of folders.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\neach of the folder names\nmean something very\nclear and specific to me.\nGINA POE: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd inside of those\nfolders are collections\nof things that make sense\nin terms of how they're batch.\nIs that one way to think about--\nGINA POE: No, that's a\ngreat way to think of it.\nAnd when you're in REM\nsleep in the later parts\nof the night and that\ntransition to REM,\nthat's when your\ncomputer of your brain\nis opening folders and comparing\ndocuments, seeing if-- is there\nanything the same?\nThese two documents\nlook very much the same,\nbut there's a little\nbit of difference.\nAnd it can link\nthose conceptually.\nSo that's probably one of\nthe origins of creativity\nis finding things\nthat are related,\nmaybe just linked a little bit.\nAnd you can find that\nlink and strengthen it\nif it makes your schema\ninteresting and different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nvery interesting.\nMany people, including\nmyself tend to wake\nup maybe once during\nthe middle of the night\nto use the restroom.\nI've tried to drink less\nfluid before going to sleep.\nI've heard also that the impulse\nto urinate, forgive the topic,\nbut a lot of people deal with\nthis, so the impulse to urinate\nis also dictated by how quickly\nyou drink fluid, not just\nthe total volume.\nSo I've switched\nto sipping fluids\nmore slowly from my last\nbeverage of the day which\nseems to help.\nBut the point here is that\nI think a lot of people\nwake up once in the middle\nof the night oftentimes\nto use the restroom but\noftentimes just around 3:00 AM\nand might be up\nfor a few minutes,\nhopefully not on their phone or\nviewing any bright light which\ncan cause more wakefulness,\nbut then go back to sleep.\nIs there any known detriment to\nthis middle of the night waking\nor should we\nconsider it a normal\nfeature for some people's\nsleep architecture?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nI think we shouldn't\nworry about it actually.\nI think sleep is really\nincredibly well homeostatically\nregulated.\nAnd so really, don't worry\nabout how much you're sleeping,\nas long as you're\nnot intentionally\ndepriving yourself of sleep\nby doing something really\nrewarding and exciting\nbecause even that is\nstressful to your body and\ndeprives you of a lot of things\nwe're talking about.\nSo don't worry about it.\nIt's absolutely normal\nto wake up at least\nonce in the middle of the\nnight to go to the bathroom.\nAnd as long as you\ncan get back to sleep\nin a reasonable\namount of time or even\nif it takes you an hour,\ndon't worry about it,\nas long as you have a lifestyle\nthat allows you to then make up\nthat sleep either the next\nmorning or the next night\nor going to bed\na little earlier.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if\nI understand correctly,\nthere's a little bit of\nasymmetry to sleep that\ncatching that first phase of\nsleep it's like you either get\nit or you don't.\nAnd you have to get\nit by going to sleep\nessentially the same time each\nnight, maybe plus or minus\n15 minutes or so.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But then\nif I wake up in the middle\nof the night and go back\nto sleep I cannot catch up,\nbut I can gather all the sleep\nthat I would have gotten had I\njust slept the whole\nway through the night.\nIs that right?\nGINA POE: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nAnd we don't know\nactually the answer to\nwhether or not the sleep in the\nmiddle between that early sleep\nand the late sleep is, in fact,\ndifferent for another reason.\nAnd whether depriving\nyourself of sleep from say,\n1:00 to 2:30 in the morning\nis bad in a different way,\nwe don't know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, I suppose I\nam the experiment in\nthat case, because I do\ntend to wake up once per night.\nAnd I've come to recognize\nit as part of my normal sleep\narchitecture.\nI don't obsess over it.\nI do notice that when\nI go back to sleep\nand especially toward morning\nthat my sleep is incredibly\ndeep.\nMy dreams are incredibly vivid.\nGINA POE: That's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't\nalways remember them.\nBut what is unique, perhaps,\nabout the architecture\nof dreams and\nsleep in the, let's\nsay the last third of the\nnight or the second half\nof the night?\nGINA POE: Right, yeah.\nIn the second half\nof the night, we\nhave longer REM sleep periods.\nAnd those are considered\nthe deepest sleep,\neven though slow wave sleep, big\nslow wave is considered deep.\nIt is deep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They call\nslow wave sleep deep sleep\nand REM sleep rapid.\nBut now, you're telling me\nthat REM sleep is actually\nthe deeper sleep?\nOK.\nThere needs to be\na new nomenclature\nof sleep researchers.\nGINA POE: You really shouldn't\ncall it deeper night.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, please.\nGINA POE: The\nreason why they call\nslow wave sleep deep\nsleep is because it's\ndifficult to arouse\npeople out of that state.\nAnd when you do arouse\nthem out of that state,\nthey are most often confused and\njust want to go back into sleep\nand can go back pretty easily.\nIf you arouse someone\nout of REM sleep,\nthey're more likely to\nreport something that was\nreally almost like wakefulness.\nIt was so vivid.\nBut in fact, if you give\nsomeone a non-threatening kind\nof stimulation like somebody\ndropping keys, or a ping,\nor something like that,\ninstead of waking--\nthat same volume will wake\nsomeone up out of non-REM sleep\nbut out of REM sleep and instead\nlengthen the amount of time\nor make it even more dense--\nyour rapid eye\nmovements more dense.\nAnd often people will\nincorporate that sound\ninto their dreams.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So the\nbody and brain are somehow\nconscious of the of the sound.\nAnd I've heard also\nsmells can even make it\ninto our dreams in REM sleep.\nBut that it doesn't rouse us--\nGINA POE: It doesn't\narouse us as often, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nGINA POE: And maybe one of\nthe reasons why REM sleep\nis deeper especially in adults\nand older people, that deep\nslow wave sleep goes away.\nSo it's not as deep.\nIt's not as big.\nThe slow waves aren't as large\nwhich is probably problematic,\nbut we are not sure.\nAnd so then REM sleep\nbecomes the deepest stage.\nActually in children,\nit's kind of a toss\nup, because it's really\nhard to wake them up out\nof that deep slow wave sleep.\nAnd in fact, fire alarms\ndon't wake them up,\neven really loud fire alarms\nout of that state of sleep.\nSo that's why they're trying\nto change fire alarms so\nthat instead of something\nthat the kids don't associate\nwith anything like the,\nwhatever, they don't associate\nthem, it says their\nname or something else\nthat may be less loud\nbut more salient to them\nand will wake them up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I don't\nknow having carried\nsleeping children\nin from the car,\nI don't know that I want\nchildren to start waking up\nfrom sleep because that's\none of the best things when\nwe get home and the kids\nare asleep in the backseat.\nYou can literally throw\nthem over your shoulder,\ngently of course, and\nput them to sleep.\nThey are completely out.\nGINA POE: Yeah, it's wonderful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt is wonderful,\none of nature's gifts.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens once\nor usually twice a day is\nthat it gets me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nand Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiome health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met.\nAnd it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy to mix\nup Athletic Greens while you're\non the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D-3 K-2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D-3 K-2.\nSo this enhanced\nvolume or proportion\nof rapid eye movement sleep in\nthe second half of the night\nrelates to more\nelaborate dreams.\nWe are paralyzed during\nREM sleep, correct?\nGINA POE: Yes,\nnormally paralyzed.\nAnd that's really\ngood, because that's\nthe time when we're actively\ndreaming storyline dreams.\nAnd we could hurt ourselves.\nWe're actually really cut\noff from the outside world\nin terms of responding\nto, say, this table,\nor window, or a door.\nAnd so different from\nsleepwalking which\nis out of slow wave sleep.\nAnd out of slow wave\nsleep, that sleepwalking\nis a mixture between\nsleep and wakefulness.\nSo you actually will\nrespond to the door,\nor you can cook a full meal,\ndrive your car while you're\nin deep slow wave sleep.\nIt's scary, because you never\nknow what you're going to do.\nYou don't have voluntary,\ninvoluntary control over it.\nYou have no conscious\ncontrol over it.\nBut you can actually\nsafely navigate\nsome situations in\nsleepwalking and actually have\na conversation.\nAlthough, it may not make\nmuch sense when you're sleep\ntalking.\nIn REM sleep, you're not\nprocessing the outside world.\nAnd instead, when you're\nacting out your dreams,\nyou could be doing things like\nwalking through a plate glass\nwindow or falling off of down\nthe stairs, things like that.\nSo you really want\nyour muscles to be\ninactivated during REM sleep.\nOtherwise, you will\nact out those dreams\nand really hurt yourself\nor your bed partner.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What about\nsleep talking or talking\nin sleep?\nI don't know how many\nrelationships have\nbeen saved by sleep talking.\nBut I'm guessing a few\nhave been destroyed.\nAnd I'm guessing that talking\nin sleep could have meaning\nor perhaps has no\nmeaning just as dreams\ncould have meaning or no\nmeaning, as we recall them.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nDo not take sleep talking\nseriously no matter\nwhat people say.\nIt doesn't necessarily\nreflect truth.\nSo it's not like you're\nbeing more truthful when\nyou're sleep talking.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You just saved\na number of relationships.\nGINA POE: I hope so.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not\ndirecting this at anyone\nin particular.\nBut I guarantee you just did.\nNoted.\nSo as people start to\napproach morning or the time\nwhen they normally\nwould wake up,\nI've heard that it's\nimportant to, if possible,\ncomplete one of these 90-minute\ncycles prior to waking up.\nThat is if you set\nyour alarm for halfway\nthrough one of these 90-minute\ncycles that come late\nin the night of sleep,\nthat it can lead to rather\ngroggy patterns of waking.\nSo I'll just ask you directly.\nDo you use an alarm clock?\nGINA POE: I do not.\nThankfully, I'm\nin a line of work\nthat doesn't require me\nnormally to do anything\nat any particular time.\nI do it when I do it.\nUnless I have to\ncatch a plane and then\nI always set my\nalarm just in case.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nas a fellow academic,\nI can tell you there are\nplenty of punishing features\nabout being an\nacademic scientist that\noffset the fact that you don't\nhave to use an alarm clock.\nBut it is nice that you can\noften set your own schedule.\nSo would you recommend\nthat if possible\nthat people not\nuse an alarm clock?\nGINA POE: Yeah, absolutely.\nIf you can just\nlisten to your body\nand wake up when you need to\nwake up, that would be great.\nBut one of the reasons why we\nhave such a grogginess, it's\ncalled sleep inertia\nwhen we wake up\nout of the wrong state which\nis deep slow wave sleep,\nis because--\nI liken it to like a\nwashing machine cycle.\nThis 90-minute cycle is like\na washing machine cycle.\nAnd the first part is\nto add water, right?\nAnd then your clothes\nare soaking wet.\nYou don't want to open\nthe washing machine\nand try and function, put\nthem on, and wear them around\nwhile they're soaking\nwet and full of soap.\nSo you have to wait until\nthe cycle is through\nbefore you can, well, actually,\nlet's put it in the dryer,\ntoo, before you\nwant to wear them.\nSo yeah, you can function.\nIt just takes a little\nwhile for those clothes,\nthat brain to dry out, so you\ncan actually function well.\nBut it's better to wait through\nthe whole cycle is complete.\nAnd so that's why\nyou want to set\nthat 90-minute, alarm clock.\nAnd again, that's\naround 90 minutes\nbecause the first stage of\nsleep, the first cycle of sleep\nis actually a little longer,\nmore like 105, 110, minutes.\nBut then the second\nones and third ones,\nthey get shorter and shorter\nas the night goes on.\nAnd in the last\nfew cycles, you're\njust doing the end to REM sleep\ncycle which takes less time.\nAnd if you wake up\nout of REM sleep,\nthere's usually no\nproblem cognitively.\nYou're good to go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are you\na fan of sleep trackers?\nGINA POE: Sure, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you use one?\nGINA POE: I have one on.\nI don't take--\nI don't live my life\nby them, because they\nare-- the best ones\nright now are about 70%\neffective at staging your sleep.\nSo 70%, it's OK, it's OK.\nBut take it with a grain\nof salt is what I'm saying.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI've tried various ones.\nAnd I compare the\nmattress based one to--\nactually wear it on my\nankle instead of my wrist.\nAnd I do find it informative.\nBut a colleague of\nmine at Stanford,\nAli Crum, who works on mindset\nand belief effects talked\nto me about a study they\ndid where people often\nwill bias their sense\nof daytime wakefulness\nbased on their sleep score more\nthan their subjective score.\nIn other words,\nif they were told\nthey got a poor night's\nsleep, even if they\ngot a great night's sleep--\nand this was of course\nmeasured in the sleep lab\nso they were able\nto compare-- people\nreport feeling more groggy.\nAnd the opposite is also true\nthat if it says 100% or 90%\non your sleep score,\nthen people go, oh, I\nfeel great, even though they\nmight not have slept well.\nSo this speaks to the, I don't\nwant to say placebo effect,\nbut the belief effects that\nare woven in with a score.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nThat's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo it seems to me\nthat combining subjective\nand objective data\nis probably best.\nGINA POE: And I do believe\nthat you should trust your own\nphysiology and the way that\nyour body is telling you to feel\nbecause in fact, it used to\nbe that people with insomnia\nweren't--\nwere often not believed because\nyou put them in a sleep lab,\nand they look like\nthey slept great.\nAnd you wake them\nup in the morning,\nthey say, oh, I didn't\nsleep very well at all.\nAnd that's because\nprobably we just came out\nwith a paper that shows that\nsubcortical structures can\nbe in a completely\ndifferent sleep state\nthan cortical structures which\nis what we measure in the sleep\nlab what the cortex is doing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nGINA POE: So it\nmight be that people\nwho say, I did not sleep\nall night long even\nthough the cortex is saying,\noh, no, you had great sleep,\nwas because they're\nmonitoring their subcortical,\nhypothalamus, hippocampus,\nthalamus, other structures\nthat the sleep lab\njust can't access\nunless you have depth electrodes\nwhich nobody really wants.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nBecause that requires holes\nin the skull and wires.\nWow.\nSo does that mean that the last\n50 plus years of sleep science\nis potentially\nflawed in some way,\nbecause they're only\nrecording from--\nI guess this would\nbe the analogy\nwould be-- it's like\nrecording from the surface\nof the ocean as opposed\nto the depth of the ocean.\nGINA POE: Right.\nAnd trying to ascertain the life\nmoving down deep in the depth--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Brace\nyourselves colleagues\nat Stanford sleep\nlab and elsewhere.\nBut please just tell us\nbecause I think scientists\nwant to know the truth.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nIt's not for nothing\nthat you want\nto know what the\ncortex is doing.\nThe cortex is really\nimportant for a lot of things.\nBut it doesn't\nnecessarily tell you\nwhat a lot of other really\nimportant parts of the brain\nare doing in terms of sleep.\nBut there's hope, because\nin fact, it would be great.\nI think that's possible, from\nthe paper if you look at it,\nit's in PNAS this year, that\nyou could detect subtle changes\nin the cortical\nEEG that might be\nable to tell you what the\nsubcortical structures are\ndoing.\nThings like the absolute\npower in that sleep\nspindle band, that\nsigma band would change\nif the hippocampus is in\nREM sleep and the cortex\nis in that sleep spindle\nstate and vise versa.\nSo there is some\nhope that we can\ngain from people with\ndepth electrodes or animals\nwith depth electrodes that we\ncould backwards machine learn\nwhat the cortex might\nbe able to tell us\nabout subcortical structures\nfrom the cortical EEG, so.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nThis is going to be a\nstimu-- yes, stay tuned.\nIt's going to be a stimulus for\ndevelopment of new technology\nwhich is always going to\nassist in scientific discovery.\nThere is one more\nthing I wanted to ask\nabout the architecture\nof the night sleep\nin terms of early\npart of the night.\nEarlier, you\nmentioned the washout\nof debris and the\nso-called lymphatic system,\nI think is what\nyou're referring to.\nCould you tell us\na little bit more\nabout the washout that occurs\nin the brain during sleep,\nwhat that is, and what\nroles it's thought to serve,\nand perhaps if there are any\nways to ensure that it happens\nor to ensure that\nit doesn't happen,\nand obviously we\nwant this to happen?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nAll right, great question.\nWe talked about\nthe circadian clock\nand how certain things\nhappen at certain times.\nWell, one of the\nthings that happens\nwhen we're awake and\ntalking to each other\nis that there's a\nlot of plasticity.\nThere's something that I'm\nlearning from you today.\nAnd you're learning from me.\nAnd that changes\nour synapses, and it\nchanges the way our proteins are\ngoing to be folded and changed\nduring sleep.\nIt unfolds.\nThis process actually uses a\nlot of ATP, the power structure\nthe fuel of the brain.\nAnd it unfolds also proteins\nwhile we're doing this,\nwhile we're using them.\nAnd so during that first part\nof the night, when we first\nfall asleep in the\nfirst 20 minutes or so,\nwe're building that\nadenosine back into ATP.\nAnd that's probably\nwhy power naps\nare called power naps,\nbecause we're actually\nrebuilding the power.\nAnd then we're also cleaning\nout through the deep slow waves\nof slow wave sleep.\nWe're cleaning out all\nthose misfolded proteins,\nunfolded proteins,\nand other things that\nget broken down and\nneed to be rebuilt\nwhen we're asleep because of\nits use during wakefulness.\nSo I liken that to having a\nbig party during wakefulness.\nAnd you need all those\npartygoers to leave in order\nto do the cleanup.\nAnd so what I think the\nmechanism is, and this is still\nsomething to be\ntested, is actually\nslow waves themselves\nwhich is bad news for us\nas we get older.\nAnd those slow\nwaves get smaller.\nAnd so your sleep goes away.\nSo what happens when a neuron\nis firing is that it expands,\nthe membrane expands a little\nbit, becomes more translucent.\nThat's how we know--\none of the ways\nwe know that neurons\nexpand when they fire.\nAnd so every action\npotential, the membrane\nexpands a little bit, as sodium\nbrings water into the cell.\nAnd then when they're\nsilent, they contract.\nAnd so during slow\nwaves, the cool thing\nis that the reason why\nyou can measure them\nis that all the neurons\nat the same time--\nnot all of them but a\ngood portion of them--\nare firing at the same time\nand silent at the same time.\nAnd so you think about that\nas contracting and expanding\nall at the same time.\nIt's like a bilge\npump of the brain.\nSo that can pump out--\nglia are also really\nimportant for this\nin terms of cleaning up\ndebris and transferring it\nto where it needs to go.\nSo I think of it\nactually as a bilge\npump cleaning out our brain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nI've heard about the lymphatic\nsystem and lymphatic wash out.\nI've never thought about\nthe mechanical aspects of it\nbefore.\nI always thought that for\nsome reason that now it's\nobvious to me, there had to be\nsomething mechanical but only\nnow that you've\neducated me about this.\nI thought that for some reason\nthe cerebral spinal fluid just\nstarts washing through.\nBut here, you're talking\nabout literally an expansion\nand a contraction of\nthe neurons in unison\nand pushing the fluid\nthrough, cleaning out\nany misfolded proteins\nor debris that\nmight occur on the basis of\nthese metabolic pathways.\nAnd the consequence\nof that is to, what,\nto leave the brain in a\nstate of more pristine action\nfor the next day.\nis?\nThat right?\nGINA POE: Yeah you think\nof it, again, like a party.\nAnd if you don't clean\nup after that party\nand you try and hold\nanother one the next day,\nit's going to get more clogged.\nPeople have a harder time moving\naround and enjoying themselves.\nAnd if that builds\nup day after day,\nit's going to be cognition.\nThat would be the\npartygoers moving around\nbecomes hard, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd so this bilge\npump that you\ndescribe is associated\nwith the big slow\nwaves of deep-- well,\nof slow wave sleep.\nSo this is going to occur more\nor less in the first third\nof the night, is that right?\nGINA POE: That's right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd are there things\nthat inhibit this process\nand are there things\nthat facilitate this process?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nSo well, one thing to inhibit\nis not to get it but--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nAnd here, too-- sorry\nto interrupt but--\nand is this similar to the\ncase with growth hormone\nwhere if you go to sleep\nlater than you would normally,\nyou miss the washout?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nnot you don't delay it.\nYou miss-- you\nmissed the washout.\nGINA POE: That's right.\nThat's right.\nSo if you go to sleep at\n1:00 or 2:00 in the morning,\nyour sleep is still going\nto be dominated by N2,\nNREM sleep not by\nslow wave sleep.\nSo you need to--\nyou need to get that\nfirst bit of sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWould a caveat to that\nbe if somebody normally goes\nto sleep at 1:00 or 2:00\nAM and wakes up at 10:00 AM\nif that's their normal sleep\ncycle--\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nThat should be OK.\nIt should be OK.\nYou would probably want to do--\nsomebody would want to do\na sleep study with people\nwho do that normally and see if\nalso the melatonin release is\nlater and the corticosterone\nrise that happens normally\nin the morning\nalso happens later.\nSo if everything shifted, good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nYeah.\nThere are a few\nstudies I've come\nacross that really do argue\nfor the fact that waking up\ncirca sunrise, that doesn't mean\nat sunrise but within an hour\nor two, maybe three\nhours of sunrise\nand going to sleep within\nfour hours after sunset\nor so is actually better for\nthe health of all human beings\nthan is being a night owl.\nAnd the night owl,\nthere's almost\nlike a night owl posse\nout there, especially\non social media.\nThey get very upset when\nyou say that you should\nsee morning sunlight\nthat after 10:00 AM,\nyou kind of miss the boat.\nThey get very upset,\nbecause I think\nthere are about 20% or\n30% of people perhaps\nwho really feel like they\nfunction better staying up\nlate and waking up late.\nAnd they function much\nless well waking up early\nand going to bed early.\nBut the data on health metrics\nsuggests that, sorry night\nowls, that they are wrong.\nGINA POE: Yeah, sorry me\nbecause I'm a night owl.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, boy.\nOK.\nWell, then I'm\napologizing directly.\nHere, I'm not a really\nearly morning person.\nI'm more typical.\nI wake up naturally around 6:30,\nsomewhere between 6:30 and 7:30\nAM, go to sleep somewhere\nbetween 10:00 and 11:00 PM.\nThese are averages.\nBut I do notice\nthat when I force\nmyself to get up\na little earlier\nand go to sleep a little\nearlier, that my mood\nand alertness and just overall\nproductivity is much higher.\nAnd there could be other\nvariables to that, too.\nGINA POE: You're\nabsolutely right.\nI'm a night owl.\nI love staying up late\nat night doing you know,\nwriting grants, writing\npapers, watching movies,\nwhatever it is.\nI love it.\nBut like you and like\nevery human being on earth\nwould do better if I go to bed\nearlier and wake up earlier.\nSo one good thing\nfor night owls is\nto have a child, because\nthey will wake you up.\nTheir circadian\nrhythms are so strong.\nThey will wake up.\nAnd even if you\ndeprive them of sleep\nin the first half\nof the night they\nwill still wake\nup like clockwork,\nbecause their circadian rhythms\nare so strong at 6:00 AM.\nAnd so what you've-- you\nhaven't done anything good\nfor your kid.\nYou haven't moved their cycle\nto later and be more in line\nwith yours.\nIn fact, you've just\nsleep deprived them\nand made them miss a window and\nmade them cranky the next day\nand made your life\nmore miserable.\nSo go to bed soon after\nyour kids go to bed and wake\nup with them.\nThat's the way to do it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nThe child alarm clock, another\nreason to have children.\nGINA POE: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ngot a dog, a puppy,\nand then that became a\ndog, specifically, well,\nfor many reasons.\nBut one reason was I wanted to\nbe one of those early morning\nrides, 5:30 AM every morning.\nBut I ended up getting a\nbulldog that would literally\nsleep 16 hours if he could.\nA nuclear bomb could go off,\nand he wouldn't wake up.\nBut what I started to learn\nwas that Bulldogs actually\nhave sleep apnea.\nAs far as I know,\nthey're the only species\nthat has a genetically--\nthey're essentially an\ninbred sleep defect.\nAnd so I actually\ndon't encourage\npeople to get bulldogs because\nit's kind of a cruel breed.\nThey suffer a lot in that\nbody that they're born into.\nAnyway, a dog can\naccomplish some of this.\nBut get the breed of dog that\nis going to wake up early.\nSo in other words, don't\nget a bulldog or a mastiff.\nGINA POE: Well, interestingly,\nall predatory animals\nlike dogs, and cats,\nand lions, and us--\nwell, more dogs, cats,\nand lions, then us,\nwell, can sleep 16 hours a day.\nFerrets are predatory.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nhad a pet ferret.\nI used to-- and\nsadly, I also used\nto work on ferrets,\npublished a number of papers,\ndelightful animals.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nAnd great because you\ncan study development.\nIt's really cool,\nbecause they're\nborn very artricial like\nwe are with brains that\nare not very well developed.\nAnd so you can see what\nhappens through development\nand how important these\ndifferent phases of development\nreally are.\nBut yes, yeah, maybe we're\nnot as much predators\nas we think because in\nfact, our sleep is somewhere\nbetween the prey\nand the predators\nin terms of the amount of sleep\nthat we usually need a night.\nBut those predators can sleep\n16 hours, napping all day long.\nAnd they're more\ncrepuscular, perhaps,\nlike their prey are, more--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\ndawn and dusk active.\nGINA POE: Yeah, dawn\nand dusk active.\nYeah.\nBut anyway, yes,\nchildren and dogs--\nactually, there was a poll\ndone by the National Sleep\nFoundation to see what\nthe number one thing is\nthat wakes people up at night.\nAnd number two is\ngoing to the bathroom.\nNumber three is\nchildren, because--\nwhen your children are young.\nBut that only lasts a few\nyears that they'll wake you up\nwhen they're babies.\nBut the number\none thing is pets.\nAnd pets needing\nto go out or cats\nwanting to curl up\nwith you or whatever\nit is, pets' needs\nwill wake you up more\nin the middle of the\nnight than anything else.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Another reason\nto not get a nocturnal pet.\nPeople who get\nhamsters, pretty quickly\nrealize that they are\nnocturnal, and they want\nto run on their wheel around.\nGINA POE: Yeah, you got to\nput them in the living room\naway from where you sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I vote fish\ntank, folks, freshwater fish\ntank.\nThere are all sorts of reasons\nto not get a salt water fish\ntank or a child.\n[LAUGHS]\nI appreciate that vote.\nAnd I appreciate you\nmentioning ferrets.\nAnd by the way, folks,\nthey are carnivores.\nThey are not rodents.\nAnd they are-- they have very\nelaborate brain structures.\nThey're very smart, in the same\nfamily as the honey badgers\nand the other mustelids.\nAnyway, I shouldn't geek out\ntoo much on the mustelids\nor else I'll take the\nremainder of all our time.\nI'd love for you to\ntell us about REM sleep\nand the sleep later in\nthe night as it relates\nto dreams and emotionality.\nAnd this is probably the\nappropriate time for you\nto introduce us to this\nincredible structure\nin the brain, which is the locus\ncoeruleus a difficult structure\nto spell but a beautiful-- a\nbeautifully named structure.\nI find locus coeruleus\nto be just fascinating.\nAnd I know a small\nfraction of what it does.\nAnd I'm hoping you're\ngoing to educate me\nand our audience more about\nwhat it does and hopefully\ntell us a little bit\nabout its relationship\nto epinephrine a.k.a.\nadrenaline.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nI am so glad you\nbrought this up,\nbecause I can totally geek\nout on the locus coeruleus.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Please do.\nGINA POE: Locus, meaning\nspot or place and coeruleus,\nmeaning blue so you could\njust call it the blue spot.\nThat's the easiest.\nEvery animal with a brain\nhas a blue spot and--\nyeah, and I mean,\nevery other animal\nwith a brain because\nof course, there\nare animals with nervous\nsystems that are not\ncentralized like jellyfish.\nBut anyway, we're\ndigressing there.\nSo the local coeruleus\nis filled with neurons\nthat have in them\nnorepinephrine which\nis the brain's version of\nepinephrine or adrenaline,\nis also called noradrenaline.\nAnd what it does is,\njust like adrenaline\nand the rest of our\nbodies, it helps\nprime us to respond\nto our environment.\nSo when locus coeruleus neurons\nfire and fire in a burst,\nwe can switch our attention.\nAnd they will fire in a burst\nif, for example, a loud noise\nhappens in the middle of your\nconcentrating on something.\nSo you can-- it\nhelps-- it fires.\nAnd it helps you switch\nyour attention to that thing\nand then learn quickly from it.\nSo it's really important\nin a stress response.\nIt helps us do quick\none trial learning.\nAnd then tonic\nactivity during the day\nwhen you're just\ndoing normal going\nabout your normal concentration\nactivities is really\ngood for sustained attention.\nIt works with the cholinergic\nsystem of our basal forebrain\nwhich is really important\nfor learning and memory\nalso to help us learn about\nthings and put things together.\nBut just tonic\nlevels are signature\nof wakefulness and alertness.\nSo too much is panic with\na locus coeruleus activity.\nA burst is switching attention.\nAnd then tonic levels are\nsustained constant attention.\nAnd then when we go to\nsleep, the locus coeruleus\nslows and goes from\nabout on average two\nHertz to about one Hertz, one\ncycle per second, tonically.\nAnd then when we\ngo into REM sleep,\nit's the only time when\nit shuts off completely.\nAnd it appears that,\nthat complete silence\nis really, really important\nfor a number of things.\nAnd the main thing that I\nthink it's important for\nis the ability to erase and\nbreak down synapses that\nare no longer working for us.\nSo they encode things\nthat are false now,\nor they are encoding things\nthat we learned in the novelty,\nencoding pathway of our brain\nthat have now been consolidated\nto other pathways.\nAnd so we need to now erase\nthem from the novelty encoding\npathway.\nAnd that is really,\nreally important\nfor being able to continue to\nlearn things all of our lives,\nso like erasing\nthat REM or that--\nwhat you call those, disks that\nyou stick into computers that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Hard drive--\nno, thumb drives.\nGINA POE: Yeah, erasing\nyour thumb drive.\nSo that thumb drive is what\nyou carry around all day long.\nAnd then during sleep, you write\nthat thumb drive to the cortex,\nto the long term\nmemory structures.\nAnd you need to refresh\nthat thumb drive.\nAnd that's what happens\nduring REM sleep\nwhen the locus coeruleus is\noff, because whenever it's on\nand noradrenaline\nis there, it helps\nus to put things together.\nIt helps us to learn\nand strengthen synapses.\nBut it does not allow\nus to actually weaken\nsynapses that are also a really\nimportant part for life--\nimportant part of\nlifelong learning.\nYeah, so much more I\ncould say about that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, locus\ncoeruleus sounds fascinating.\nSo it's connected to the basal\nforebrain cholinergic system.\nThe neurons in locus\ncoeruleus, if I'm not mistaken,\nrelease norepinephrine,\nperhaps epinephrine as well?\nGINA POE: Well, no, the\nbrain's version of epinephrine\nis norepinephrine.\nThe other thing it also--\nthe precursor to\nnorepinephrine is dopamine.\nAnd so the source of\ndopamine in the hippocampus\nseems to be the locus coeruleus.\nAnd it's still a mystery\nis under what conditions\nthe locus coeruleus\nalso releases dopamine.\nBut it's really important when\nwe're learning something new\nto also release dopamine\nor to at least activate\nthe dopaminergic receptors\nin our hippocampus.\nSo yeah, so dopamine,\nnorepinephrine,\nand then there's\nalso galanin which\nis important for releasing\nwhen we're stressed.\nAnd it helps also\nwithout rapid learning.\nIt works in concert\nwith norepinephrine\nand in doing what it needs to\ndo to strengthen synapses so\nthat we learn really quickly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI love that there\nare multiple molecules involved,\nbecause that signals us\nto a principle which is that\neven if people can't remember\nall the names, that\nrarely in biology\nis something handled by just\none molecule or pathway.\nThat redundancy is the rule\nbecause signaling attention\nto specific events\nis so important.\nSo that-- I'm going to\nuse that as just a story.\nI always say I wasn't\nconsulted at the design phase.\nBut it makes sense to\nme as to why redundancy\nwould exist in this system.\nGINA POE: Absolutely.\nAnd in fact, when we form a\nhypothesis about the brain,\nwe are always wrong.\nAnd the reason why\nwe're always wrong\nis because it's more complicated\nthan we'd like to think.\nAnd because in our brains\nwhen we're forming hypotheses,\nit's we fail to account\nfor all of the factors that\nare involved, the glia,\nthe neuropeptides,\nthe neurotransmitters, the\nphysical structure of synapses.\nAnd so when I was going through\ngrad school 35 years ago, we--\nthe dogma was that every neuron\ncontains one neurotransmitter\nand releases one\nneurotransmitter.\nAnd you had excitatory\nneurotransmitters,\nand inhibitory\nneurotransmitters, and neuro--\nmodulatory neurotransmitters.\nBut that's as\ncomplicated as it's got.\nAnd then we started talking\nabout neuropeptides.\nAnd people said, oh, no,\nplease don't complicate it.\nAnd then we started talking\nabout how neurons contain\nboth neuropeptides and\nneurotransmitters and maybe\nmore than one neurotransmitter--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe\neven hormones, too.\nGINA POE: And hormones and-- oh,\nLord, it's just so complicated.\nBut I've got to admit\nthat's why it works, right?\nAnd every time the brain teaches\nus something new about itself\nthat we didn't\nhypothesize, we say,\noh, of course, that wouldn't\nwork if the way I hypothesized\nit-- with it.\nWe actually need redundancy.\nWe need all of these\nsystems to work together.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nIt's daunting\nsometimes, but it also\ninsures many careers in science\nand neuroscience in particular.\nSo note that\naspiring scientists,\nthere's plenty of\nroom for discovery.\nGINA POE: Do you want me to\ntalk about norepinephrine--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSo what--\nGINA POE: Emotion and--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.\nWell, what I'd love-- what\nI'd love for you to tell\nus about is what role this\nlack of norepinephrine release\nduring rapid eye movement\nsleep is thought to achieve?\nAnd maybe you can also\nreview some of your work,\ndescribing conditions under\nwhich norepinephrine invades--\nGINA POE: Yeah, invade sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRapid eye movement\nsleep and other\npatterns of sleep\nand how that can be detrimental.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nSo a lot of this is\nhypothetical but based\non a lot of good evidence\nthat we're sewing together\ninto a schema from which\nthese hypotheses come,\nso a model schema from\nwhich the hypotheses come.\nBut one thing that\nhappens to people\nwith post-traumatic\nstress disorder\nis that there is\na lot of evidence\nthat the locus coeruleus doesn't\nstop firing in REM sleep.\nSo-- whereas their\nlevels of norepinephrine\nmight be similar to\npeople without PTSD\nduring the day and even during\nthe first part of the night,\nduring the wee hours\nof the morning.\nAnd when you measure\nnorepinephrine levels\nfrom metabolites in the blood\nor the cerebrospinal fluid,\nyou see that people\nwith PTSD, it's\nduring the wee\nhours of the morning\nwhen you have the most\nREM sleep that they\nhave their norepinephrine levels\ndifferentiate most from those\nthat don't have PTSD.\nAnd so that's evidence that\nthe locus coeruleus is not\nshutting down during REM\nsleep like it should.\nOther evidence is\nheart rate variability.\nWhen our locus\ncoeruleus is firing,\nour heart rates are\ngenerally a little higher.\nAnd they don't vary\nas much as they\ndo when the locus\ncoeruleus is not firing.\nSo during slow wave\nsleep, normally,\nhave this big, juicy variability\nin heart rate with every breath\nin and breath out because\nour noradrenergic levels\nor norepinephrine levels are\nlower during REM sleep that\ngoes away entirely.\nAnd our heart rate is dominated\nby parasympathetic rather than\nsympathetic activity and also\nwhat our brain is driving,\nwhat our dreaming about.\nFor example, if we're\ndreaming we're running,\nour heart rates will go up.\nBut norepinephrine levels\nstill should be low or off.\nSo people with PTSD that\nnoradrenergic's we're\nstudying these in\nrats, too, is it true\nthat our locus coeruleus\ndoesn't shut off\nwhen we have post-traumatic\nstress disorder?\nAnd the preliminary\nevidence is yes, it's\ntrue that it doesn't shut off.\nSo what that would do\nis norepinephrine would\nact at synapses to prevent\nthat weakening that you really\nneed for example of novelty\nencoding structures.\nAnd it keeps memories in that\nnovelty encoding structure\neven once it's consolidated\nto the rest of the brain.\nSo in the hippocampus which\nis important for remembering\nthings throughout our lives\nand it's that thumb drive,\nwe need it to be\nerased so that we\ncan learn new things once\nit's been consolidated\nto the hard drive of our cortex.\nAnd so if we're not\nable to do that,\nwe fill up that\nRAM really quickly\nor that thumb drive\nreally quickly,\nand we're not able\nto learn new things.\nSo for example,\nafter a trauma, I\ntalked about the locus\ncoeruleus responding\nin stressful situations.\nThat's great.\nIt's very adaptive.\nBut then you need it to stop.\nOnce you've learned what\nyou need to learn from it\nand you want to go to\nsleep, you need the locus\ncoeruleus to calm down.\nAnd during REM sleep,\nyou want it to stop,\nbecause then when\nyou consolidated\nthat traumatic\nmemory to the cortex,\nyou need to erase it from the\nnovelty encoding structures,\nfor example, in the\nhippocampus so that then when\nyou're in the context\nof safety, you\ncan learn those new\nthings, those new contexts\nand stop responding\nto those same stimuli\nas though you're in\nthat original situation.\nSo if you're not able to\nerase that thumb drive,\nyou will always feel\nlike that trauma happened\nthat same day,\nearlier that same day\nand respond as you\nwould to an early--\na recent trauma which is with\nbeating heart and all of that.\nSo even memories\nthat are years past,\nif you're never able to\ndownscale that novelty encoding\nstructure and purge it\nfrom that traumatic memory,\nit will stay fresh, and new,\nand then become maladaptive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto just take a brief moment\nand thank one of\nour podcast sponsors\nwhich is Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that blood\nwork is the only way that you\ncan monitor the markers such\nas hormone markers, lipids,\nmetabolic factors, et cetera.\nThe impact, your immediate\nand long term health.\nOne major challenge\nwith blood work,\nhowever, is that most of the\ntime it does not come back\nwith any information\nabout what to do in order\nto move the values for hormones,\nmetabolic factors, lipids, et\ncetera into the\nranges that you want.\nWith Inside Tracker,\nchanging those values becomes\nvery straightforward because\nit has a personalized\ndashboard that you can use to\naddress the nutrition based,\nbehavior based, supplement\nbased approaches\nthat you can use in order\nto move those values\ninto the ranges that are\noptimal for you, your vitality,\nand your longevity.\nInside Tracker now\nincludes a measurement\nof apolipoprotein B, so-called\nApoB, and their ultimate plan.\nApoB is a key marker of\ncardiovascular health.\nAnd therefore,\nthere's extreme value\nto knowing your ApoB levels.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Inside Tracker,\nyou can go to\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInside Trackers plans.\nAgain, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nWhat approaches are\nyou aware of that\ncan turn down the output\nof locus coeruleus\nduring these phases of sleep?\nAnd for that matter,\nwhat things can\ncause ramping up\nof locus coeruleus\nduring this phase of sleep?\nWe've had a couple of podcast\nepisodes, solo episodes\nand with guests\ntalking about trauma.\nWe had Dr. Paul Conti who's\na Stanford trained, Harvard\ntrained psychiatrist who\ntalked a lot about trauma\nwrote an excellent\nbook on trauma\nand certainly sleep was\nemphasized as a key thing like\nget enough sleep.\nBut here, you're saying\neven if somebody with trauma\ngets enough sleep,\nif locus coeruleus is\nhyperactive during sleep, those\ntraumas are going to persist.\nAnd most of the trauma\ntreatments that I'm aware of\nare everything ranging from\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\ntalk therapy, drug\ntherapy, EMDR, hypnosis.\nNowadays, there's a lot\nof interest and attention\non clinical studies on exploring\npsychedelics, high dose\npsilocybin, and MDMA.\nSo it's a vast landscape, none\nof which, as far as I know,\nis really focused on\nsleep specifically.\nGINA POE: No, they're not.\nAnd they should be, because\nactually, psychedelics\nis a sleep like state.\nAnd it's a REM sleep like state.\nAlthough of course, there\nare some major differences.\nSo yeah, so much\nto talk about here.\nSo antidepressants are often\nnoradrenergic or serotonergic\nreuptake inhibitors.\nSo they leave\nnorepinephrine actually\nout there in the synapses.\nAnd what that does is\nit inhibits REM sleep.\nAnd if you're able\nto get REM sleep,\nit would probably\nbe REM sleep with\nsome noradrenergic activity.\nSo actually, I think--\nanyway, I'm not a physician--\nthat antidepressants\nare counter indicated.\nYou don't want to take them\nif you've experienced a trauma\nand you're experiencing\nPTSD, because if anything,\nit's going to make\nit worse or at least\nprevent the type of\nadaptive REM sleep\nthat you really need in order\nto resolve those emotions\nand move on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs that statement\nspecific to\nantidepressants that tickle\nthe noradrenergic pathway?\nSo the one that\ncomes to mind is--\ncan never pronounce it,\nbuproprion, which is what--\nI think brand name\nis Wellbutrin.\nIt's a dopaminergic and\nnoradrenergic agonist.\nSo that's the net\neffect as opposed\nto the Prozac, Zoloft\nvariety which are SSRIs.\nGINA POE: Yes, yes.\nBut SSRIs themselves\nalso are problematic,\nbecause-- we didn't\ntalk about it yet,\nbut the dorsal\nraphe nucleus which\nproduces serotonin which\nspecific serotonin-- specific\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors\nblock from being reuptake\nand leaves too much\nserotonin out there.\nAnd what serotonin also is\nanother noradrenergic-- sorry,\nanother neurotransmitter that's\ndownregulated during REM sleep.\nThat's specifically\noff during REM sleep.\nAnd what serotonin does is it\nweights all of our cognition\nto being able to\nrecognize novelty again.\nSo it weights our brain away\nfrom a sense of familiarity\nand toward novelty.\nAnd it might be\none reason why it's\nan effective antidepressant\nbecause it makes the world feel\nfresh and new again, right?\nBut you-- when you\nhave too much, you're\nholding a novel traumatic\nmemory in your novelty encoding\nstructure too\nstrongly already, you\ndon't want to, again, weight\nthings toward novelty.\nYou need that\nabsence of serotonin\nalso to help you get\nthat sense of familiarity\nand to start erasing the\nnovelty encoding structures.\nSo you need both to be absent.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nreally interesting.\nWe hear a lot about serotonin.\nAnd it's not often discussed in\nterms of its features related\nto novelty enough I think.\nAnd what you just described\ncues me to something\nthat Dr. Paul Conti and others\nhave said in terms of trauma.\nAnd here, I'm paraphrasing,\nso my apologies to them\nfor not getting\nthis exactly right,\nthat an effective\ntreatment for trauma\ndoes not erase the\ntraumatic memory.\nBut it causes a transition\nof what once was disturbing,\nand invasive, and maladaptive\nto eventually just become\na boring old story that has\na fuzzy texture to it as\nopposed to this sharp\nhigh friction texture that\ninvades our thinking\nand obviously,\nour sleeping states as well.\nSo again, and I\nappreciate the disclaimer,\nthe caveats around not being\na clinician, et cetera.\nBut I do think that there's\na lot of interest now\nin whether or not\nantidepressants are\neffective for trauma or not.\nAnd I think these aspects\nof neuromodulation\nas they relate to, let's call\nit, erasing traumas or changing\nthe emotional load of\ntraumas during sleep\nis something important\nto take note.\nWe also have a lot of clinicians\nthat listen to this podcast.\nSo they should also\ntake note, please.\nSo if I want to reduce the\namount of norepinephrine\nreleased from locus coeruleus\nduring rapid eye movement sleep\nto eliminate the troubling or\nmaybe even traumatic memories\nand allow late stages of\nsleep each night to have\ntheir maximum positive\neffect, is there anything\nthat I can do besides avoiding--\navoiding traumas, avoiding\nserotonergic or noradrenergic\ncompounds?\nGINA POE: Well, I would also\navoid anything just prior\nto going to sleep that\nmight excite those systems,\nso a lot of novelty, a\nlot of the exciting stress\ninducing video games.\nTry and enter sleep with\nas much calm as you can,\nso maybe deep\nbreathing exercises.\nThat's a beautiful way to\ncalm your sympathetic fight\nor flight system\nis deep breathing.\nAnd we haven't been able\nto test this with rats\nbecause we can't ask them to\ndo a deep breathing exercise.\nThere might be a\nway we can do that.\nBut I haven't found out\nor figured it out yet.\nBut if there's a way you can\nmake your sympathetic system,\nnervous system calm down\nbefore you go to sleep,\nmight free for you\nmeditation, or deep breathing\nexercises might be\nfor some, a warm bath,\nor a comforting book, nothing\ntoo exciting but also nothing\ntoo boring, perhaps,\njust something\nright in the middle which\nmakes you feel happy and calm\nis what you should do.\nAnd if you instead go to\nsleep while you're anxious\nor you're hyped up, then your\nsleep could become maladaptive.\nAnother thing that happens\nin rats that we have yet\nto know if it\nhappens in women is\nthat female rats have three\nphases of their estrus cycle\nthat their locus coeruleus\ndoesn't seem to calm down\nduring REM sleep as much.\nAnd we don't know why, but\nduring the high estrogen phases\nof their estrus cycle, the\nlocus coeruleus shuts down\njust like it does in male rats.\nBut in the other three\nphases, it doesn't.\nSo one thing that might\nwork and in fact, there\nare a few studies that show\nit could work really well\nis giving women\nafter a trauma event,\nsomething that\ncontains estrogen,\nbecause estrogen somehow\nis protective against PTSD.\nAnd they know that through\na retrospective studies,\nwhere they gave women in\nemergency room either a pill\nwith estrogen and/or without.\nAnd those that had the\npill with estrogen in it\nwere much less likely to\nget PTSD from that trauma\nas measured a year\nlater than those\nthat had the pill without.\nSo there's really good\nstudies by Bronwyn Graham--\nshe's out of Australia--\nto really hone in\non how much estrogen do you\nneed and also testosterone\njust so you know, gets converted\nto estrogen in the brain.\nSo testosterone also\ncan be protective,\nbecause it gets\nconverted to estrogen.\nBut there's something\nabout estrogen\nthat's really helpful\nand protective\nabout from the high\nlocus coeruleus firing.\nAnd this is, again, preliminary\ndata that we don't have full--\nwe don't have all\nthe answers yet.\nAnd we are looking into\nit actively right now.\nBut it's really important.\nThe other thing about\nwomen is that we\nare two to four times more\nsusceptible to anxiety related\nmental health disorders\nincluding post-traumatic stress\ndisorder.\nSo if we could figure out what's\nhappening to locus coeruleus\nduring sleep in women\nand then figure out a way\nto normalize that so the\nlocus coeruleus is silent\nwhen it needs to\nbe silent, I think\nwe could go a long\nway in helping\nwomen be more resilient to\nstress related disorders.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What are\nsome other sex differences\nas they relate to sleep?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nThat's a really good question.\nThere have been very few\nstudies, unfortunately,\nof women and sleep, women and\nestrus cycle or menstrual cycle\nand sleep.\nBut what we have found which\nactually largely replicated\na study in 1960 is\nthat women or females\nrather at high estrogen,\nhigh hormonal phases\nof their estrus cycle\nor menstrual cycle sleep\na lot less.\nBut that sleep is\nmore efficient.\nSo that sleep is more dense\nin those sleep spindles, which\nI haven't gone into\nwhat they might\ndo except this connection\nbetween the hippocampus\nand cortex.\nBut those sleep spindles are\nmore dense and more coherent\nacross the brain areas.\nThe theta cycle which\nis 5 to 10 Hertz\nin the hippocampus important\nfor one-year learning\nand also important\nduring REM sleep\nis also bigger\nand juicier during\nthe high hormonal phases.\nSo even though\nthere's less sleep,\nit's more efficient and better.\nSo all of that efficiency\nseems to be reduced\nin those other hormonal phases.\nSo even though you might\nsleep a little more,\nyou might need more\nsleep, in fact,\nin order to accomplish\nthe same thing that you\ncan get with that short\nvery efficient sleep\nof high hormonal phases.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nVery interesting.\nI think there is\na growing trend,\nat least among NIH-funded\ngrants to require\nthat as they refer to it in\nthe grants of biological sex\nas a variable.\nAnd here, we're\ntalking-- nothing here\nabout sex, the\nverb, although, I'm\nsure there are studies\nabout that, too.\nBut biological\nsex is a variable,\nbecause there is a dearth\nof studies exploring sex\ndifferences in most everything.\nThere are all sorts\nof reasons for that.\nBut more importantly\nthat fortunately,\nthe trend is shifting.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nAnd even when you study males\nversus females, a lot of people\njust say include\nfemales in their studies\nbut then don't track the estrus\ncycle or menstrual cycle.\nAnd hormones have huge\neffects on our behavior.\nJust think about-- when you said\nsex before our hormones come\nin, we're not interested in it.\nAnd suddenly, that's kind of\na main driver of behaviors.\nHormones can definitely change\nwho we are and what we do.\nSo we should be studying\nhormones not just sex.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I always\nsay that puberty is perhaps\nthe most massive\ntransformation and rate\nof aging that any of us go\nthrough in a short amount\nof time.\nAn individual, their\ncognition changes.\nTheir worldview changes.\nAnd that's largely\nhormonal-driven.\nAnd obviously, neural\narchitectures change, too.\nI'm very happy that\nyou mentioned--\nI'm trying to get\ninto calmer states\nprior to sleep and\nsome ways to do that.\nI'm a big fan and I've talked\na lot before on this podcast\nabout things like yoga nidra\nwhich is a non-movement based\npractice, sometimes called\nnon-sleep depressed where\npeople actually take some\ntime each day to practice how\nto go into a more\nparasympathetic a.k.a relaxed\nstate deliberately, because\nit's a bit of a skill.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's-- and\nthere there's some good data\nreally, mostly out of a\nlaboratory in Scandinavia\nshowing huge increases in\nnigrostriatal dopamine when\npeople go--\nbasically, engage in a practice\nof deliberate non-movement\nand that the brain\nactually enters\nstates of a very shallow sleep.\nSo it's sort of nap-ish.\nBut the idea is to actually\nstay awake but motionless.\nAnd it does seem to restore\na certain number of features\nof neurochemistry.\nBut perhaps more\nimportantly, it teaches\npeople to relax which is\nsomething that most people are\nnot very good at.\nBut in any event--\nand people who listen\nto this podcast\nhave heard me say this\nover and over again,\nso I sound like a broken\nrecord, but this practice\nas a zero cost practice\nthat doesn't require\nany pharmacology does seem to\nreally enhance people's ability\nto fall asleep more\nquickly and to fall back\nasleep if they wake up in\nthe middle of the night.\nSo in any event, another\nplug for NSDR, yoga nidra.\nGINA POE: Well, I\njust also want to add\nto that, that's one of\nthe reasons why insomnia\nis so insidious is because when\npeople feel like they haven't\ngotten enough sleep, and they're\nnot getting enough sleep,\nand they become anxious\nabout getting enough sleep,\nand then they're anxious\nbefore going to sleep,\nlike I'm not going\nto fall asleep,\nit's going to be 45\nminutes, and then that's\na positive feedback loop.\nSo you need to break\nthat loop, say, OK,\nmy body is going to get\nas much sleep as it needs,\nI needn't worry about it, and\nthen practice this relaxation\nto say, hey it's all OK,\nit's going to be all right,\nand then concentrate on\nthings that relax you,\nwhether it's\nconcentrating or not\nconcentrating, whatever it is.\nYou mentioned yoga nidra.\nAnd that reminded me of\ntranscendental meditation\nwhich is something that also\nhasn't been studied well,\nlargely because we can't ask\nnonhuman animals to do it.\nAnd so we don't know\nwhat's happening\nwith our neurochemistry\nand our brain activity\nin a deep and meaningful way.\nBut one thing that\nhas been shown\nin those that can\ndo it really well\nis that, that theta\nactivity that I said\nhappens when you're\nlearning something\nor when you're in REM\nsleep, it's well established\nand increases during the\ntranscendental meditation.\nSo it might be that some\nstates of meditation\ncould in some ways\nreplace or mimic\nsome functions of, for\nexample, REM sleep.\nBut again, we don't know\nif all the neurochemistry\nis right to do, for example, the\nthing that I was talking about,\nwhich is erasing the\nnovelty encoding structures\nof the brain.\nThat needs an absence of\nnorepinephrine and serotonin,\nwhich we don't know\nif that goes away\nwith transcendental meditation.\nWe just don't know the\nanswer to that yet.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nThe studies on yoga nidra\nand sleep replacement\nare interesting.\nIt does seem to be the case\nthat nothing can really\nreplace sleep except sleep.\nBut that if one\nis sleep deprived\nor is having trouble\nfalling back asleep\nthat these things like--\nand I hear it's--\nI acknowledge this is\nessentially like yoga nidra,\nbut we now call it\nnon-sleep deep rest or NSDR,\nbecause oftentimes, for\nnames like yoga nidra\nact as a barrier for what\nwould otherwise be people\nwilling to try a practice.\nIt sounds mystical.\nGINA POE: --and yoga.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It sounds\nlike flying carpets.\nAnd it sounds like you\nhave to go to Esalen.\nBy the way, Esalen\nis a beautiful place.\nBut it sounds like you have to\ngo there or live in the West\nCoast to believe in this stuff.\nBut it's simply not the case.\nThese are practices\nthat are really\njust self-directed relaxation\nas a practice that allows people\nto get better and better\nat directing their brain\nstates towards more relaxation.\nAnd most people\nhave an asymmetry.\nLike for instance,\nmost people can force\nthemselves to stay up later.\nBut they have a hard time\ngoing to sleep earlier.\nAnd that just speaks\nto the asymmetry\nthat's probably adaptive\nin survival-based\nthat we can ramp ourselves up\nfar more easily than we can\ntend to calm ourselves down.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nAnd actually to appeal to\nother Christians like me,\nprayer can be a wonderful\nway to calm yourself down,\nbecause through prayer you're\ngiving your carries to God\nand saying--\nand then you are\nrelaxed, more relaxed.\nAnd I just want to say that\nbecause, the same reason\nthat yoga might put\nsome people off.\nIt might put some people\noff to talk about prayer,\nbut it's the same process of\nbeing able to relax, and yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And get\noutside our own experience\na little bit.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nBack out get a world\nview that might actually\nalso help us to relax.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nyou might be surprised\nat how many clinicians\nand scientists who've\ncome on this podcast have\nmentioned things like prayer\nfrom various perspectives,\nChristianity, Judaism,\nMuslim traditions,\nand others that--\nas a parallel to\nall of these things.\nAnd I think what it speaks to\nis the fact that, ultimately,\nthe biological architectures\nthat we're all contending with\nare going to be\nidentical, right?\nAnd so different ways to\ntap into them and ones\nthat are congruent with people's\nbeliefs, I think are great.\nGINA POE: Yeah,\nbecause anything,\nnon-congruent with your\nbeliefs is also stressful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd feels forced.\nAnd that's why this\nidea of calling it\nnon-sleep deep rest in\naddition to yoga nidra\nwas not to detract from\nthe naming or the history\naround yoga nidra.\nBut I was finding\nthat it was a barrier.\nLikewise, yoga nidra tends to\ninclude things like intentions\nwhereas NSDR scripts.\nAnd by the way, we will provide\nlinks to some NSDRs and yoga\nnidra scripts.\nBut NSDR has no intentions.\nIt's simply a body scan\ndeep relaxation-based.\nSo it's the scientific\nversion of all of this stuff.\nAnd actually, we study\nit in the laboratory\nand some of the brain\nstates that people go into.\nBut that's a discussion\nfor another time.\nGINA POE: This is hard not to--\nMy mother used to tell\nme when I would complain,\nI can't go to sleep, she'd\nsay, well, start with your toes\nand relax.\nSo you would clench your\nmuscles around your toes\nthen relax them and do that\nall the way from your toes\nall the way to your head.\nAnd I don't know\nwhere she got this,\nit might have been\nher own common sense\nor she might have gotten\nit from this NPR shows\ncalled The Mind Can Keep You\nWell she used to listen to.\nBut that's another\nintentional relaxation\nthat focuses on the\nbody rather than\non your own mental\nprocesses, but.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I do a little\nbit of work with the military.\nAnd there's a method\nwithin certain communities\nof Special Operations\nin the US military,\nwhere if they can't sleep\nor they're having challenges\nsleeping, they will\ndeliberately try and relax\ntheir facial muscles in\nparticular like drape\nthe facial muscles\nand use long or exhale\nemphasized breathing\ndoes seem to increase\nthe probability of\ntransitioning back into sleep.\nAnd those are hallmarks of yoga\nnidra, non-sleep deep rest,\nbody scans.\nAnd so I think all\nof these things\nconverge on a common theme.\nAs neurobiologist, we can\nsay, all of the things\nthat we are describing\ncertainly move the needle away\nfrom locus coeruleus activation.\nAnd we haven't\ndone the experiment\nto really look at that.\nBut it seems all these things\nare counter to noradrenaline\nrelease.\nGINA POE: Right.\nAnother one is yawning.\nYawning in itself\nis, in fact, kind\nof tensing of all the\nmuscles in your face\nand then relaxing them.\nSo it might be why we yawn.\nWe don't know why we yawn yet.\nBut it might also-- it\nwould be really great.\nActually, animals yawn, too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: My bulldog\nwas a-- perpetually.\nIf he wasn't sleeping,\nhe was yawning.\nGINA POE: And it would be\ninteresting to see what yawning\ndoes to the locus coeruleus.\nDoes that also calm and switch\nthe locus coeruleus activity,\nbecause it's an interesting\nthat facial nerve\nlike trigeminal nerve\nthrough the vagus\nconnects indirectly\nto the locus coeruleus\nand has a powerful\neffect on that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nA common, I think friend of ours\nand direct colleague of yours,\nJack Feldman was a guest\non this podcast telling us\nabout all the amazing structures\nhe and others have discovered\nin respiration and breathing.\nIt sounds like we\nhave a collaboration\nbrewing the three of us\nshould definitely carry out.\nI'd love for you to share\nwith us a little bit more\nabout the spindles that\nhave come up a few times.\nAnd I don't know if\nit's relevant to this.\nSo if it's not, let's\nseparate it out.\nBut I'd love for you\nto tell us a little bit\nabout the role of sleep in\nproblem solving and creativity.\nAnd if spindles are\ninvolved, then I'll\nconsider myself lucky\nfor batching them\nin the same question.\nAnd if they're not\ninvolved, simply\nfeel free to separate them out.\nGINA POE: I think they\ncould be involved.\nAnd the reason why\nI think they could\nbe involved because we now\nknow a lot more about spindles.\nFirst of all, the first\nthing that we knew--\nfirst of all, we ignored them.\nThen we thought\nthey had something\nto do with keeping us asleep.\nAnd that was their function is\nwhen an external stimulus came,\nthey would keep us asleep\nbecause they would arise.\nBut now, we know that\nthe density of our sleep\nspindles, the number that\nwe produce per minute\nis well correlated\nwith our intelligence\nin the first place\nand that no matter\nwhat your intelligence is and no\nmatter what your sleep spindle\ndensity is, if you're learning\nsomething during the day\nand increase your\nsleep spindle density,\nit's really almost perfectly\ncorrelated with our ability\nto consolidate that\ninformation and incorporate it\ninto the schema that we\nalready have in our brain.\nSo if you try and\nlearn something new,\neven if your sleep spindle\ndensity at baseline\nis great, if you don't increase\nyour sleep spindles that night,\nyou're not going to use\nsleep to really incorporate.\nInterestingly,\nsleep spindles are\npoor in those with\nschizophrenia.\nIt's one of the\ncharacteristic signatures\nof sleep is that sleep spindles\nare very few and far between,\nwhich might mean that\npeople with schizophrenia\nmight not be able to incorporate\nnew information into already\nexisting schema.\nAnd instead, it flaps\nin the breeze out there\nand can be accessed\nerroneously at times when you\ndon't want it to be involved.\nSo I digress, so sleep\nspindles and creativity.\nSo one of the things we now\nthrough some great studies\nby Julie Seibt and Anita\nLüthi is that sleep spindles\nare accompanied by an\nincredible plasticity\nout in the distal\ndendrites, the listening\nbranches of our neurons that\nlisten to other cortical areas.\nSo there are proximal\ndendrites in our neurons\nthat listen to\nthe external world\nand are conducted\nthrough the thalamus.\nAnd then there are\ndistal dendrites\nwhich listen to an internal\nconversation that's\nhappening in our brains.\nIt's kind of our\ninternal state, really.\nAnd during sleep\nspindles, that's\nwhen those distal dendrites\nare able to best learn\nfrom other cortical areas\nand from the hippocampus.\nIt is during sleep spindles that\nthe hippocampus and the cortex\nare best connected and when\nthat incredible plasticity\ncan happen.\nWhen I talk about schema, that's\na cortical, cortical thing.\nThat's when the image of\nSanta Claus and presents\ncomes together.\nIt's not through\nsome external thing.\nOnce we learn those\nthings together,\nit's our cortex that\nencodes that and brings\nthose images back up together.\nAnd that's during\nsleep spindles when\nthat's happening, when that--\nthere's big surges of calcium\ninto those distal dendrites,\nand where plasticity happens\nin just huge amounts.\nDuring that sleep spindle stage\nof sleep which is N2 stage,\nthere's also another\nexcitatory event\nthat comes all the\nway from the brainstem\nand projects everywhere\nin our cortex which\nis called PGO waves.\nThat's P for pons, G\nfor geniculo nucleus\nof the thalamus which is where\nthey're first discovered,\nand O for occipital\narea which is\nour visual area which is, again,\nwhere they're first discovered.\nBut in fact, it's now been shown\nthat PGO waves, which we should\ngeneralize to P waves because\nthey come from the pons\nand go to the thalamus\nand then the cortex,\nhappens all over the brains.\nAnd that is where glutamate,\nwhich is a major excitatory\nneurotransmitter involved\nin learning and plasticity\nis being released\nin big amounts,\nalso in those distal dendrites.\nSo P waves and\nspindles work together\nto cause plasticity and\nsew our schema together\nwhich could be the origins\nfor insight and creativity.\nNow, when PGO waves or P\nwaves were first discovered,\nit was thought to be random,\nbecause this small area that\ngenerates P waves\nall over the brain\nprojects all over the thalamus\nand causes P waves all over.\nAnd you don't measure P\nwaves all over the brain\nat the same time.\nIn fact, it's just seems\nsporadic and random.\nSo that's probably-- and P\nwaves also happening even more\nduring REM sleep, rapid\neye movement sleep.\nSo that's why people\nthink that REM dreams are\nso random is because\nthese P waves are random.\nAnd they could generate\ndreams because they're\nan internal source of excitation\nthat replaces the outside world\nduring our dream state.\nAnd so these P waves, if they\nare random, could function--\ncould be the\nunderlying reason why\nREM sleep dreams are random.\nAnd it might also be why\ncreativity can happen there\nbecause we're\nrandomly activating--\nco-activating different\nthings in our brain\nthat we can then sew together.\nBut it might not be\nas random as we think.\nSo that's the caveat there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I just\nlearned a lot from you,\nbecause I teach brain\nstem to medical students.\nAnd I talk about the pons.\nAnd the pons is like\nthis dense collection\nof all these different\nnuclei involved\nin a bunch of different things.\nAnd it's close by a bunch\nof interesting things.\nAnd it's still a\nmysterious brain area.\nBut when I learned\nabout PGO waves,\nI thought\npons-geniculo-occipital,\nbecause occipital is\nmost commonly associated\nwith visual cortex,\nI thought it was\nthe origin of the visual\ncomponent of dreams.\nGINA POE: And probably is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nvery happy to learn\nthat they should be called P\nwaves, because they include\nlots of different\nareas of the brain.\nAnd it makes really\ngood sense to me\nwhy the pseudo\nrandomness of dreams\nespecially these late\nnight and early morning--\nlater in sleep I should say\nand early morning dreams\nseem to be cobbled together\nfrom disparate experiences.\nYou walk through a\ndoor and suddenly, it's\na completely different\ncontext and landscape.\nGINA POE: Yes,\nbeautiful. beautiful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlike this idea a lot.\nIt makes intuitive sense\nit makes biological sense.\nIt also gives me\nsomething to talk\nabout to the medical\nstudents next quarter\nwhen I talk about pons.\nGINA POE: Right.\nYou want to talk about\nwhere in the pons,\nit's right below\nthe locus coeruleus.\nIt's called the sub coeruleus.\nThey're glutamatergic.\nIt's also called SLD, sub\nlateral dorsal nucleus, so.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So note to\nany aspiring neurobiologist,\nthere's a vast landscape of yet\nto be undiscovered structure\nand functions in the pons.\nYou want to work\non something that\nis sure to reveal something\nnovel, work on the pons\nbecause it's in every textbook.\nIt's clinically very\nimportant structure.\nSadly, gliomas and other cancers\nof the brain can sometimes--\ncan often surface in the pons.\nBut we still know\nvery little about it.\nI read a paper this\nlast year or-- and I\nthink it was covered in\na bit of popular press,\nthat during rapid\neye movement sleep,\npeople can solve problems or\nrespond to external stimuli.\nFor instance, they would\ngive them math problems.\nThey'd whisper in their\near while they were\nin REM sleep, what's 2 plus 2.\nAnd then people would say, even\nthough they were paralyzed,\napparently they could\nstill move their mouth,\nbecause they'd say four\nor something like that.\nOr they'd say, what's your name.\nAnd people could respond.\nAnd so that in REM\nsleep, perhaps, people--\nsome elements of cognition\nare still active.\nGINA POE: I'm glad\nyou brought that up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nare you thinking--\nand I don't know the\nauthors of that study and--\nlisten, if ever I\nsay something wrong,\nit's great on this podcast\nbecause someone will tell us\nin the YouTube comments.\nIt's one of the great\nuses of YouTube comments.\nBut I'd love to know your\nthoughts on that study.\nIs that just kind of an\nodd feature that or does\nthis have meaning.\nShould we actually\ncare about this result?\nGINA POE: There is\nno just about it.\nIt's really actually\nintriguing and interesting\nand might relate to\nthis paper that I\ntalked about where we said\ndifferent areas of the brain\ncan be in different\nstates at the same time.\nSo lucid dreaming\nis another thing\nwe can't ask animals\nto do or can't ask them\nif they've done it.\nBut we can certainly\nask humans to do it.\nAnd some people can\ndo it really well.\nAnd it would be really\ninteresting to see\nin those people who could lucid\ndream really well whether they\nspend more or less time\nin this asymmetrical state\nwhere one area of the\nbrain is in one state\nand another area of the\nbrain is in another.\nAnd it might be that those\npeople can respond to questions\nduring REM sleep.\nBest are those that have the\nmost asymmetry or dissimilarity\nor dissociation between\nsubcortical and cortical\nstructures.\nOr it might be that they're the\nones with the most symmetry,\nwe don't know.\nI do worry a little bit\nabout lucid dreaming,\nbecause people are-- it's a fad.\nPeople are really\nexcited about it.\nAnd to be able to\nremember one's dreams\nis fun often unless\nthere are nightmares.\nBut it's really interesting.\nOr to be able to direct one's\ndreams if they are a nightmare\nis really a wonderful\npower to have,\nto be able to redirect\na nightmare that\nhas been repeated\nto something else\nand then kick\nyourself out of that.\nRepetitive nightmare\nis really nice.\nBut I worry a\nlittle bit about it,\nbecause we know so\nlittle about what's\nactually going on in the brain.\nAnd if this lucid dreaming\nstate is preventing us\nfrom, for example, from the\nlocus coeruleus from calming\ndown or the serotonergic system\nfrom silencing like it should,\nand maybe what we're\ndoing during this state\nis Yeah we're activating the\nlearning and memory structures\nbut in a way that's maladaptive\nin terms of the erasure\nthat we need to do.\nSo maybe one of the reasons\nwhy most people don't\nremember most of their\ndreams is for good reason.\nYour hippocampus\nis in a state where\nit's not writing new memories.\nIn fact, it's writing out\nits-- the memories it learned\nduring the day to the cortex.\nAnd it's immune from\nincoming new information.\nSo maybe lucid dreaming\nis bad, because you're\nactivating the hippocampus\nin a way that's\nwriting new memories.\nAnd it might be\nreally maladaptive\nfor things like PTSD.\nOn the other hand, let me just\nargue myself right out of this,\nwhen I used to have a repeated\nnightmare when I was a kid,\nmy mother who was so wise would\ntell me, well, listen, just--\nnext time you're in that\ndream, say, hey, I'm in a dream\nand then change\nsomething about it.\nSo she and I rehearsed\nwhat the horrible\ndream that it was, big\nmonster running after me.\nAnd my legs were like mud,\nand I couldn't run away.\nAnd it was just terrifying.\nAnd that was a dream I would\nhave time and time again.\nShe said, OK, next\ntime what are you\ngoing to do when that\nmonster comes after you?\nI'm going to run away.\nNo, that's what\nyou do every time.\nAnd it's always\nthe same outcome.\nYou can't run.\nSo let's do something different.\nWhat could you do\nthat's different?\nSo I came up with all--\nI could turn around and\npunch it in the nose.\nYeah, that's great.\nAnd so the next time\nI had that dream--\nI did recognize this is\nthat same old dream which\nmeans that there's\npart of my brain\nthat's conscious enough to know\nthat I'm in a dreaming state.\nAnd then I didn't have\nthe courage in my dream\nbecause I was still\nterrified to punch or touch\nthe monster in any way.\nBut I did have the\ncourage to turn around\nand look it in the\neye and say no.\nThat was enough.\nI said no.\nAnd that was enough to knock me\nout of that rut of that dream\nso that I never had it again.\nI never had that\nsame dream again.\nAnd in fact, it gave me\npeace about dreaming,\nbecause I knew\nthat if ever there\nwas a nightmare that\nwas just too scary,\nI could probably do something to\nchange it and knock myself out\nof it.\nSo even though, I don't\nrecommend lucid dreaming\non a normal day-to-day basis, if\nit's enough that can knock you\nout of a rut--\none thing that happens\nwith people with PTSD\nis they have the same repeated\nhorrible nightmare which\nis often a reliving of\nthe days trauma that had.\nSo maybe lucid dreaming\ncan be used on occasion\nto be a powerful tool, because\nthere's so much plasticity that\nhappens during REM\nsleep to knock you out\nof that rut of reliving that\nevent and just change it.\nAnd you could probably practice\nthat during wakefulness,\nrehearse the event that\nhappened that was so traumatic\nand then just introduce a new\nelement like, now, I'm safe.\nNow, the sound that was\nassociated with that really\ntraumatic thing, I should now\nassociate with something else.\nAnd the next time\nI have that dream,\nI'm going to change it\nso that sound is now\nthis new thing that it should\nbe associated with safety.\nAnd that might be\nenough, maybe, I\nhope, to knock you out of\nthat repeated nightmare\nand maybe even start you\non the path to recovery,\nbecause if you can calm\ndown about those nightmare\nstates of sleep, then maybe\nyour local coeruleus which\nis involved in stress\ncan also relax.\nAnd you can do the erasure\nparts that need to be done.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nI seem to recall a paper--\nand I'll have to find the\nreference and send it to you,\nwe will also put in the\nshow note captions--\nthat described a protocol\nessentially matches this idea.\nAnd I think what they had people\ndo was either cue themselves\nto a particular smell\nor tone in wakefulness\nthen to try and recall\na recurring nightmare.\nThen during the\nnight sleep, they\nhad the tone playing in the\nbackground which would then\ncue them to the wakeful\nstate-- they're still asleep,\nmind you, but in the pseudo\nlucid or lucid state,\nand then try and change some\nvariable as you're describing.\nSome either look the\npredator in the eyes\nor do something different.\nAnd then in the waking state,\ntake a little bit of time\nto try and script out a\ndifferent narrative altogether.\nAnd it took several\nnights, as I recall,\nor more but that they were\nable to escape this recurring\nnightmare.\nGINA POE: It's like a\nweek or something, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So you're\nfamiliar with the study?\nGINA POE: That's\na beautiful study.\nI loved it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, we\nwill put a reference to that.\nI need to revisit that study.\nIt was pretty recent, but I\nneed to dive into it again,\nbecause I think I didn't go as\ndeep into it as I should have.\nGINA POE: No, no but the\none thing that you-- you\nsaid many right things.\nBut one of the\nthings you said is\nthat they were able to cue the\ndreamer when they knew-- when\nthey were going to REM sleep.\nAnd then they played the\nsound or had the odor.\nNow, when you're normally\nasleep alone in your bed,\nyou're not going to be\nable to cue yourself.\nBut it might be that rehearsal\nenough before you go to sleep\nis enough to help cue you\nto that repeated nightmare,\nremembering what the nightmare\nis and then figuring out\nhow to cue yourself to\ndo something different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFor years, I had\nthe same recurring nightmare\nover, and over, and over again.\nAnd it was so\nsalient and so clear.\nAnd I'm not going to share\nwhat it is, because it's not\nthat it's that disturbing.\nIt was just--\nI think it was the\nemotional load of it\nand just how salient\ncertain features were,\nlike one person who's\na real life person had\na particular clothing on.\nAnd it's like, and that\njust served as this cue.\nAnd I don't know if I ever did\nany direct work to try and deal\nwith it.\nBut now, it almost seems\nsilly to describe it.\nGINA POE: Oh, yeah.\nWell, dreams are usually\nsilly to describe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt pretty silly.\nBut it was a pretty\nviolent dream.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nAnd your emotional\nsystem is so geared\nup during REM sleep\nwhich is another thing we\ncould talk about.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, please.\nI would love to.\nYeah, so locus coeruleus\nis ideally suppressed.\nSo we can't release\nnorepinephrine.\nWe can't act out our dreams\nduring these very emotionally\nladen thoughts and\nstorylines during sleep.\nThis almost starts to sound\nlike a little bit of a built\nin while sleeping\ntrauma therapy,\nbecause most trauma\ntherapies involved\ntrying to get people\ninto states of counter\nto what most people\nthink you actually\nwant to get close to the trauma\nin terms of the narrative\nor try and suppress the\nemotional activity of it or--\nI guess that's the motivation\nfor ketamine-based therapies\nfor trauma--\nor I've also heard, and this\nis still perplexing to me,\nthat other waking-based\ntrauma therapies involve\ntaking people the other way,\nmaking it very cathartic,\ntake them to the peak of\nthe emotional response\nbut then allow that\nto finally cycle down\ninto a more relaxed response.\nSo please, if there's\nanything about locus coeruleus\nand dreams and that can help\npeople basically extinguish\ntraumas or traumatic\nfeatures to real life events,\nwe definitely want\nto know about them.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nWell, I think one of\nthe things that people\nthought might help after a\ntrauma like a school shooting\nor whatever, car accident,\nis to talk about it.\nBut in fact that ended up\nbeing counterproductive.\nAnd I think one of the reasons\nwhy it was counterproductive\nis because it didn't\ntake them back down.\nIt brought them up and\ncontinued to reactivate\nthe emotions of\nit but then didn't\nemphasize the safety of\nthe fact that it's over\nor help them work through\nhow they might avoid it again\nin the future to calm the\nsympathetic nervous system down\nagain before they went to sleep.\nAnd none of these studies has\nsleep ever been considered.\nBut to me, that's the key\npart, is bringing down\nyour sympathetic nervous\nsystem before you\ngo to sleep so that your\nsleep can be adaptive,\nyour locus release can\nshut off like it normally\ndoes or should do and then able\nto erase the novelty of it.\nThe other thing that I\njust mentioned a minute ago\nwas that the emotional system is\nhighly activated in REM sleep.\nAnd that's definitely true.\nAnd that might seem\ncounterproductive\nin terms of the\nnightmares and how\nto help REM sleep be\na therapeutic thing\nrather than reinforcing the\nemotionality of the trauma.\nAnd I think the key\nto that again is\nthe absence of norepinephrine.\nSo even though the emotional\nsystem is in high gear,\nwithout norepinephrine,\nyou can actually\ndivorce those highly\nactivated emotions\nfrom the cognitive\nparts of the memory\nthat you have just written\nout in that N2 stage of sleep\nwhen the sleep\nspindles are going.\nSo you've just now\nconsolidated the information\nthat you'll need to survive\nand to make that adaptive.\nAnd now, you need to\ndivorce from that schema\nand from that semantic parts\nof memory, the emotional part,\nbecause whenever you\nremember something,\nit's fine if you remember the\nbeing emotional at the time.\nBut you don't want to bring\nback and sew into that memory\nall of the same\nemotional systems.\nYou don't want to bring\nback the heart rate\nchanges, and the\nsweating, and all of that.\nYou want to be able to\nremember all the parts of it\nand even remember that\nyou were traumatized\nand that you did cry\nand that you did have--\nyour heart was racing.\nBut when you're talking\nabout it years later,\nyou don't want to have to\nrelive all that, otherwise who\nwould ever want to recall a\ntraumatic memory because you're\nbasically putting yourself\nthrough the same trauma which\nis what people with PTSD have.\nThey don't want to recall\nthis traumatic memory,\nbecause it's reliving it.\nLike it's just happening again.\nSo that's what we're thinking\nis that the emotional parts are\nno longer-- are not\nable to be divorced\nbecause the norepinephrine\nsystem is not\ndownscaled during REM sleep.\nAnd so that REM sleep serves to\ninstead reinforce and in fact\namplify the emotions because\nyour emotional system is up,\nlocus coeruleus\nis high, re-sewing\nin every night the\nemotionality of those memories\nand with the memory itself.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You've told\nus a lot about locus coeruleus\nand norepinephrine\nfrom locus coeruleus.\nIs there any role for\nnorepinephrine, epinephrine,\nand cortisol released\nfrom the adrenals?\nMy understanding is that\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\nwill not cross the blood brain\nbarrier which is probably\nwhy we have a brain-based\nnoradrenergic system,\nlocus coeruleus,\nand other neurons.\nActually, that's a\nquestion I should ask you.\nAre there other\nsites in the brain\nwhere norepinephrine\nis released from\nor is it just locus coeruleus?\nGINA POE: So there are seven,\nnine different adrenergic.\nYes, there's nine different\nadrenergic structures.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\nsorry I didn't ask.\nBut it just occurred to me that\nin some cases like with raphe,\nthere are other sources\nof serotonergic drive\nin the brain.\nBut raphe is like the main side.\nGINA POE: Yeah, that's the\none that goes to the cortex\nand the locus coeruleus\nis also the one\nthat goes to the cortex.\nBut there are other adrenergic\nsources, some that--\nfrom the brainstem that descend\nand help us to ignore pain,\nfor example, when we're\nstressed and needing to run away\nfrom the tiger, right?\nWe don't want to be\nthinking, oh, my ankle hurts.\nYou want to just be\nable to ignore it\nand go do what you need to do.\nSo yeah, so there are lots of\nother noradrenergic nuclei.\nBut the locus coeruleus\nis the main one that\nprojects all over the brain.\nActually, the only place\nthat doesn't project\nis the dorsal striatum.\nYou talked about ventral\nstriatum and addiction.\nThe dorsal striatum\nis the only place\nthe locus coeruleus\ndoesn't project to.\nAnd that's involved in\nprocedural learning and motor\nlearning, kinds of\nlearning that take over\nwhen your hippocampus, for\nexample, is compromised.\nBilateral, if you don't\nhave good hippocampus,\nyou can still do procedural\nlearning and do--\nand it's great.\nIt's a redundant system.\nAnd so if your locus\ncoeruleus is not\nworking, if you don't have it\nanymore, you can still do a--\nif you don't have\na good hippocampus,\nyou can still do learning\nthrough this dorsal striatum\non the structure.\nSo it might be for those\nkinds of learning functions,\nsleep deprivation\nwhere you never\nlet the locus coeruleus\nstop firing is OK,\nbecause it doesn't have any\nreceptors for norepinephrine\nanyway.\nSo yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nabout bodily like adrenals.\nI often remind people there's no\nsuch thing as adrenal burnout,\nper se, that adrenals\ndon't actually burn out.\nBut some people have adrenal\ninsufficiency syndrome.\nOther people have\nadrenals that are just\nchronically cranking out\nepinephrine, norepinephrine,\nand cortisol at the wrong\ntimes in particular.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nSo that-- those are\ngreat questions.\nAnd I think the answers\nto them have yet\nto be discovered,\nthe connections\nbetween our periphery and\nour central nervous system.\nBut we know that there\nare beautiful connections.\nAnd it's untapped\nsource of being\nable to manipulate our brains\nis to work through our bodies.\nAnd so our adrenals\ndo great things.\nThey constrict\nour blood vessels,\ncausing higher blood pressure\nwhich helps blood rush out\nto all the extremities that need\nblood, our muscles for example,\nfor running away from\nthe lion, or the tiger--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nmeeting a grant deadline\nor catching a train.\nGINA POE: Or catching\na train, yeah.\nThe adrenals help our\nhearts pump faster.\nOur muscles get perfused\nwith the blood it needs.\nIt diverts blood\nand everything away\nfrom our parasympathetic system\nwhich is rest and digest.\nWe don't really need to\ndigest that croissant\nwhen we're running for a train.\nWe can do that later.\nSo it's doing really\nimportant things.\nWhat we don't know, because it\ndoesn't cross the blood brain\nbarrier, is how that affects\nthe brain and whether our--\nif we can independently activate\nour adrenals, when a time when\nour brain thinks that we should\nbe fine and calm and asleep,\nhow our brain detects that.\nIs it a feedback\nthrough heart is racing?\nAnd then our brainstem\nsays, what's going on,\nmy heart is racing,\nand then wakes us up.\nAnd then our hearts were racing\ntogether with our brain racing.\nWe just don't know the answers\nto these questions yet.\nThere are some good\nstudies, old studies.\nBut we need a lot more.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I will--\nanother nod to the fact\nthat there's lots of great\nwork ongoing and still to do.\nI'd love for you to tell\nus about some of the work\nthat you're doing more\nrecently on the relationship\nbetween sleep and\nopiate use, withdrawal\nrelapse, and craving,\njust addiction, generally.\nI get a lot of questions\nabout people trying\nto come off benzodiazepines\nor people's challenges\nwith benzodiazepine and\nother types of addiction.\nWhat is the role of sleep\nin addiction and recovery\nfrom addiction and\nopiates in particular?\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nThis is a very young area.\nAnd in fact, my laboratory\nhas just started.\nI have a graduate student\nwho's been in my lab\nfor just one year.\nShe's done amazing work already\nbut completely groundbreaking\nwork.\nAnd what she has\ndiscovered already--\nwe don't have the paper out\nyet, but we're working on it--\nis that when animals\nwithdraw from opiates--\nand this has been\nreplicated in other ways\nwith other types of things--\nour sleep is disturbed.\nOur sleep is terribly disturbed.\nAnd the amount of\nsleep disturbance\npredicts relapse behaviors.\nAnd you might think,\nwell, of course,\nyou're going to relapse\nif you can't sleep\nbecause opiates calm you down.\nWell, then one of the reasons\nwhy opiates calm you down\nis because the locus coeruleus,\nagain, the blue spot,\nis covered with\nopiate receptors that\nare normally really responsive\nto our endogenous opiates.\nAnd so what happens\nwhen we are pleased,\nfor example, or\nlaughing or whatever,\nendogenous dodges\nopiates activate\nthose receptors in the locus\ncoeruleus and calm it down.\nIt actually suppresses\nlocus coeruleus activity.\nIt makes us happy and relaxed.\nOne of the things, reasons\nwhy opiates are so addictive\nis because it also calms us\ndown and makes us relaxed.\nBut the problem with\nexogenous opiates\nis that they really strongly\nbind these receptors\non our locus coeruleus.\nAnd if you take exogenous\nopiates again and again\nlike you're recovering\nfrom surgery, for example,\nand take these\npain medications is\nthat our locus\ncoeruleus struggles\nto do what it's supposed to\ndo which is keep us awake,\nand learning, and\nconcentrating on things.\nSo it will down regulate.\nIt will internalize\nthese receptors\nthat are normally only\noccupied by endogenous opiates.\nAnd it will do\nthis-- it will change\nour genes that are associated\nwith producing these receptors.\nSo you actually have very\nmany fewer receptors.\nSo the locus coeruleus, at\nleast, during wakefulness\ncan fire and to help us\nto do these things learn\nabout our environment.\nAnd so if you long term\nreduce the number of receptors\nout there, then when you\nwithdraw the exogenous opiate,\nthere is not enough\nof your endogenous\nopiates to be able to occupy\nthose few receptors that\nare there.\nAnd our locus has nothing\nto calm it down anymore,\nno pacifier.\nAnd it just fires,\nand fires, and fires.\nAnd that physic and\ntonic high activity\nstresses us out,\nbecause it's normally\nassociated with stress.\nAnd so any exogenous\nstressor that adds to that\nand also activates\nour locus coeruleus,\nthere's nothing to\ncalm it down again.\nAnd so it just keeps firing.\nIt disturbs our sleep.\nAnd that's why maybe\nsleep disturbance\nis an indicator of\nhyperactive locus coeruleus\nand such a good\npredictor of relapse\nbehaviors because nobody likes\nto live in that high stress\nstate.\nAnd they will do anything\nto get back to normal.\nSo the problem with\ntaking these drugs\nis that it leaves you excited--\nI'm sorry, excited,\nrelaxed and happy.\nBut then when you\ncome off of it,\nyou're worse than when\nyou were at baseline.\nYou take it again.\nIt only brings you up\nthis far, because you\nhave fewer receptors.\nWhen you come off it, you're\ndown, even more depressed\nand anxious and--\ndepressed is a\nword I use loosely,\nand that's not what I--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Certainly,\ncentral nervous system\ndepression, sleepier, less\nmotivated, lower mood.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nOur locus coeruleus\nis actually--\nit's a anxiety kind of\ndepression actually,\nthe anxiety related depression.\nSo yeah.\nSo we don't know yet what--\nand there's some good\nresearch going on right now--\nwhat could restore our own\nendogenous receptors so\nthat our endogenous opiates\ncan properly calm our locus\ncoeruleus once that they\nhave been tamped down\nby exogenous opiates.\nBut that would be really one way\nthat you can access the sleep\ndisturbance.\nSo we talked about sleep\nand the importance of sleep\nin terms of learning and\nmemory, the importance\nof the structure of the\n90-minute cycle for all\nof that.\nSo you can imagine if your\nsleep is disturbed by too much\nlocus coeruleus activity.\nThe structure and the function\nof those sleep spindles\nand that theta during REM sleep\nand the lack of norepinephrine,\nall of those structures, all\nthose functions for learning\nsomething new, like a new\nbehavior that doesn't involve\nthe drugs becomes compromised.\nAnd so that's something that\nTania Lugo, in collaboration\nwith Pamela Kennedy\nat UCLA, that we're\nlooking at how is learning and\nmemory affected by the sleep\ndisturbance.\nIf there's a way we can--\nin animals that are\ncoming off of opiates.\nCan we restore their\nsleep to normal\nso that then they\nare less likely to do\nrelapse kinds of behaviors.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fascinating.\nAnd I will certainly have to\nhave you back on to tell us\nthe results of those studies.\nMeanwhile, I think\nfor anyone who's\ntrying to come off\nopiates, exogenous opiates\nand restore these\nsystems, what I'm hearing\nis that it's going to take\nsome time but that any and all\nthings that people\ncan do to buffer\ntheir healthy normal sleep\narchitecture like morning\nand daytime sunlight, limiting\nbright light exposure,\nlowering the temperature at\nnight, a number of things\nthat we've talked\nabout in this podcast--\nGINA POE: Breathing\nexercises, meditation,\nwhatever it is that helps you\ncalm yourself before sleep,\nyeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nWould facilitate not just sleep\nbut perhaps even accelerate\nthe recovery and\nshorten this period\nof withdrawal, which\nfrom the questions I get\nand from what I hear can\nbe absolutely brutal.\nGINA POE: Yeah.\nOh, I can imagine.\nI had to take opiates for--\nI only took it for three\ndays after giving birth\nto my first son, I think,\nsecond son, one of them.\nAnd just-- I just said after\nthree days, this is enough.\nI'm just going to try Tylenol.\nAnd so I weaned\nmyself-- not weaned,\nI just did a sudden\nsharp cut off.\nAnd even though I felt--\nI didn't get the high\nof opiates when I\nwas taking the Tylenol codeine.\nWhen I went off it, boy,\nit was like PMS times 100.\nI was so anxious and\nupset at little things.\nAnd thankfully, it only\nlasted a few hours.\nBut if I had taken it\nfor a week or two weeks,\nwho knows if my endogenous\nopiate receptors would\nhave been permanently\ndownregulated\nand I would have\nbeen an addict--\nor an addict-- I would\nhave been addicted.\nI shouldn't say an addict.\nThere's negative connotations.\nIt's just a very\nphysiological state.\nSo no judgments at all\nassociated with it.\nSo yeah, They're powerful,\npowerful painkillers\nbut can also alter your\nentire brain and rewire it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nall the more reason\nwhy I and many others\nare grateful that you're\ndoing this work\nto figure out ways\nthat people can recover more\nquickly and more thoroughly.\nI must say you've taught\nus a tremendous amount\nin a relatively\nshort amount of time\nabout the architecture of\nsleep, the different phases,\nthe relationship between\nsleep and dreaming\nand this incredible\nstructure, locus coeruleus.\nAnd I'm so happy we\nalso got into the pons.\nThat just delights me,\nbecause we rarely talk\nabout the pons on this podcast.\nIt's such an\ninteresting structure.\nSex differences that are\nimportant in creativity\nand problem solving and trauma\nsleep spindles, just such\na wealth of information.\nAnd much of it that's\nactionable for people.\nSo first of all, I\nwant to say thank you\nfor taking the time\nto sit down and have\nthis conversation that\nso many people are\nsure to benefit from.\nI also want to thank you\nfor doing the work you do.\nEven though I'm a\nfellow neurobiologist,\nI think that it's not often that\nwe take a step back and realize\nthat it's really\nthe work of hard--\nthinking hard, strongly\nmotivated PIs--\nit stands for\nprincipal investigator\nby the way, PIs like\nyourself, graduate students,\nand post-docs that really\ndrive the discovery forward\nand that lead to these\nnew therapeutics.\nPhysicians are wonderful.\nClinicians are\nabsolutely wonderful.\nBut clinicians don't\ndevelop new treatments.\nThey only implement the ones\nthat researchers discover.\nSo thank you for\nbeing a brain explorer\nwith a focus on growing\nthe good in the world.\nI know I speak for everybody\nwhen I say thank you so much.\nGINA POE: Thank you\nso much, Andrew.\nThank you for being an\namazing interviewer.\nYou brought a lot out of\nme in a coherent fashion\nthat normally I can't do\nwhen I'm speaking in public.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ndon't know about that.\nI've heard your lectures,\nand they're superb.\nWe'll direct people to\nsome of the other ones.\nGINA POE: Well, thank you.\nAnd I also want to put a\nplug-in for graduate students\nin general and the\nkey and amazing role\nthat they play in research.\nI'm a PI, as you said.\nI used to be a graduate student\nand a post-doc trainee myself,\ndoing all of this on the ground\nhands on experimentation.\nIt's so hard to do.\nIt's so hard to do, right?\nIt's so hard to think\nthrough all of that.\nNow, I'm a PI, I get\nto be an idea person\nand just say, hey,\nwhy don't you do this\nand hey, what do you\nthink about that.\nAnd they, of course,\nintellectually\ncontributes so much to\nthese planned experiments.\nBut they also do the\nreally hard work.\nAnd so I just want to say\nthank you graduate students.\nThank you to my\ngraduate students\nand all graduate\nstudents out there.\nThank you post-docs.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --underpaid.\nAnd listen, and to the major\ninstitutions, Stanford UCLA\nand all other major\ninstitutions, pay them more,\nplease.\nGINA POE: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We need them.\nAnd they need to have\na standard of living.\nI'm not afraid to say that\ndespite my primary employer.\nPay them more.\nThey need it.\nThey deserve it.\nGINA POE: They deserve\nit, absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nWell, we will absolutely\nhave you back again\nif you'll be willing.\nAnd meanwhile, we\nwill direct people\nto where they can\nlearn more about you\nand your exciting work.\nAnd once again, thanks so much.\nGINA POE: Thank you so
