    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Guest\nSeries, where I\nand an expert guest\ndiscuss science and science\nbased tools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's episode marks the\nfourth in the six episode\nseries on fitness,\nexercise, and performance.\nAnd today's episode is all about\noptimal fitness programming,\nthat is how to design a fitness\nand exercise program that\ncan achieve the goals that you\nwant for fitness and for sports\nperformance.\nDr. Andy Galpin,\ngreat to be back.\nIn previous episodes,\nyou taught us\nabout the various\nadaptations that\noccur at the level of cells,\nat the level of organs,\nindeed at the level of\nthe entire body that\nunderlie things like\nimprovements and strength\nand speed,\nhypertrophy, AKA muscle\ngrowth, and the various\nforms of endurance.\nAnd you laid out beautifully\nthe various protocols\nthat one can do in\norder to achieve\neach and every one\nof those adaptations.\nToday I would love\nfor you to teach us\nhow we can combine different\nprotocols to achieve\nmultiple adaptations\nin parallel--\nfor instance, how to improve\nendurance and strength, how\nto achieve some\nlevel of hypertrophy,\nperhaps directed hypertrophy\nat specific muscle groups,\nwhile also maintaining endurance\nand perhaps improving speed,\nfor instance.\nAnd if you would, I'd\nlove for you to tell us\nhow we can combine\ndifferent protocols\nand vary those across the\nweek, across the month,\nacross the year so that we\ncan make regular progress\nand perhaps even could give\nus a window into the ways\nto make the fastest\nprogress possible.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I\nwould love to do that.\nWe've invested a lot of time\nin the previous episodes\ncovering background and concepts\nand detail about the physiology\nso you understood\nwhy you're making\nthe choices you're making\nand why other choices are\nless effective.\nIn this discussion,\nI would actually\nlike to jump maybe more\ndirectly to the answer\nand kind of get right into\nthe protocol and maybe\na little bit less background.\nIf you're interested\nin that stuff,\nI suppose you have to go\nbackwards a little bit\nand watch some of those\nprevious episodes.\nBut I would love to jump in to\njust some samples, some case\nstudies, if you will,\nand kind of walk\nthrough different protocols.\nI know that over the course\nof my 11 years as a college\nprofessor and being\nin the public space\na little bit, probably the\nmost numerous style of question\nI have gotten is exactly that.\nSo I know the rep\nrange for this,\nor I know the style of\ntraining for that adaptation.\nBut how do I put them together?\nAnd I would just like\nto spend our time\ntoday going through\nthose things.\nAnd the reason I want\nto do it is this.\nSome people listening at home\nsurely just love exercise.\nThey're already bought in.\nAnd they're going to\ntrain no matter what.\nAnd they're interested in just\nactually being more effective.\nAnd so the way that you\nstructure and put your plan\ntogether will in\nlarge part determine\ngetting more progress\nfor less effort\nor actually being able to put\nthe same amount of effort in\nand getting results faster.\nThere's also some folks\nprobably listening who are like,\nOK, I exercise.\nI do what I can.\nI'm bought into the\nbenefits that you've\ntalked so elaborately\nover the 100 plus episodes\nyou've done about the\nvarious benefits of exercise.\nBut you don't like--\nyou're kind of doing it because\nyou know it's important.\nBut you're not there.\nSo for those folks,\nit's sort of like, OK,\nhow can we actually\nmake this thing\nmore effective so we can make\nsure you hit the things you're\nabsolutely have to get for the\nshort and long term benefits\nto make sure that you're looking\nthe way you want to look,\nyou're performing physically\nthe way you want to perform,\nand that you can do that\nacross your lifespan?\nSo how can we give\nyou all some structure\nto where, again, you\ndon't have to turn\ninto an absolute lover\nof physical fitness\nand it doesn't have\nto take over your life\nbut you can still get more\nresults for your same time\nrestrictions, whether\nthat be two days a week\nor five days a week\nor only certain access\nto equipment or experience,\nwhatever the case may be?\nHow can we help those\nfolks as well put together\na protocol that will get\nthem closer to their goals\nwith less restrictions?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.\nAnd I'm hoping\nthat along the way,\nyou'll also point us to how\noften to take the fitness\nassessment for each\nof the adaptations\nthat you referred to\nin a previous episode.\nWe will also link to that\nfitness assessment segment\nin the show note\ncaptions for this episode\nbecause that fitness assessment\nfor different adaptations,\nI think, is a really\npowerful way for people\nto touch in and see how much\nlong endurance do they have,\nhow much anaerobic\ncapacity do they have,\nhow much strength\ndo they really have.\nAnd then perhaps you'd\nalso be willing to throw\nin a couple of\nadditional ways that we\ncan assess our level\nof fitness and progress\nin this arc of fitness\nprogram across the year.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing.\nI can't wait to do that.\nI think it is also\nimportant before we jump in\nto acknowledge a lot of folks\nmay be thinking to themselves,\nI don't really\nnecessarily need a plan.\nWhy do I have to do that?\nI don't have a certain\ngoal I'm going after.\nI'm not running a\nrace any time soon.\nI'm not a competitive athlete.\nI just-- I go to the\ngym, and I workout.\nAnd that's great.\nWell, I would like to try to\nconvince you that regardless\nof where you're at,\nhaving a plan will achieve\nthose things we\njust talked about,\nwhich is more success\nin a shorter time frame.\nThere's actually a\nsignificant amount of research\nto support this.\nThose individuals who go\non a specific training plan\ncompared to those\nwho do not will\nreceive better\nresults independent\nof the effectiveness\nof the program.\nSo we've talked in\nprevious episodes\nabout tons of different\nstyles and strategies.\nAnd to reiterate,\nit really doesn't\nmatter which one you pick.\nThe fact that you\nhave a plan is always\nmore effective than\nnot having a plan.\nAnd so, again,\neven if you're not\nplanning on competing\nwith something,\nif you want to shorten\nthe amount of time you're\nin the gym, get more\nresults from it,\nI would strongly encourage\nto put something together.\nThe two largest reasons why\npeople don't get results\nwith their fitness\ntraining protocol\nis number one,\nadherence, and then\nnumber two, some sort\nof progressive overload.\nBoth of those two\nthings are challenging\nto accomplish without a plan.\nSo the reason people don't\ngo to the gym, one of them,\nand one of the\nreasons why it takes\nthem so long is because\nthey don't walk in\nwith a very specific plan.\nIt's sort of like going\nto the grocery store\nand figuring out what\nyou're going to buy\nversus knowing\nexactly what you're\ngoing to get in your shopping\nlist, grabbing those things,\nand getting out.\nYou'll notice your\ntime in the grocery\nstore is half the length.\nYou're more productive.\nAnd you didn't waste\nmoney on extra things.\nSo that alone will\ndrive adherence\nbecause you're now going\nto think to yourself, oh,\nthat 90-minute workout I do\nis actually really just 60.\nAnd so now the next time you\ngo to training you're like,\nman, I don't have 90 minutes.\nYou realize it's only\n60 or 40 or 30 or 20\nor whatever it needs to be.\nSo that alone will\nget you there.\nThe second part of\nthat which is overload.\nIt's very difficult to\nunderstand and remember, well,\nthe last time I did lat raises,\nI used I think 5 pounds.\nAnd I think I did like 12.\nWell, if you don't have some\nsort of system of tracking--\nand this can be as\nsimple as a notebook,\njust writing down\nwhat you did before\nand doing a little bit\nmore the next time.\nThat is going to almost\nguarantee you success.\nSo having some structure-- and\nthis structure can be fairly\nloose, so we're going to talk\nabout a bunch of different\nexamples--\nis something I strongly\nencourage everyone\nto utilize for their exercise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is also separate from\nDr. Andy Galpin's teaching\nand research roles at\nCal State Fullerton.\nIt is, however, part of\nour desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that\ntheme, we'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Momentous.\nMomentous make supplements of\nthe absolute highest quality.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is proud to be\npartnering with Momentous for\nseveral important reasons.\nFirst of all, as I\nmentioned, their supplements\nare of extremely high quality.\nSecond of all, their\nsupplements are generally\nin single ingredient\nformulations.\nIf you're going to develop\na supplementation protocol,\nyou're going to want to\nfocus mainly on using\nsingle ingredient formulations.\nWith single ingredient\nformulations,\nyou can devise the most\nlogical and effective and cost\neffective supplementation\nregimen for your goals.\nIn addition,\nMomentous supplements\nship internationally.\nAnd this is, of\ncourse, important\nbecause we realize that many\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\nlisteners reside outside\nthe United States.\nIf you'd like to try the\nvarious supplements mentioned\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nin particular supplements\nfor hormone health, for sleep\noptimization, for focus,\nas well as a number\nof other things,\nincluding exercise recovery,\nyou can go to livemomentous--\nspelled O-U-S--\nso that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've been using an\nEight Sleep mattress\ncover for about the\nlast eight months.\nAnd it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI'm sleeping about\nthe same amount.\nBut I'm sleeping far deeper.\nAnd I'm now getting the proper\nratios of so-called Rapid Eye\nMovement or REM sleep\nand slow wave sleep\nand waking up feeling far\nmore recovered mentally\nand physically.\nThe underlying mechanism for all\nthat is very straightforward.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nand elsewhere about the critical\nrelationship between sleep\nand body temperature.\nThat is, in order to\nfall asleep at night,\nyour body needs to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees in terms\nof core body temperature.\nAnd waking up involves\na 1 to 3 degree increase\nin core body temperature.\nWith Eight Sleep\nmattress covers,\nyou can adjust the temperature\nof your sleeping environment\nto be one temperature at\nthe start of the night,\na different temperature in\nthe middle of the night,\nand a different temperature\nas you approach morning,\neach of which can place you\ninto the optimal stages of sleep\nand have you waking up feeling\nmore refreshed than ever.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to\neightsleep.com/huberman\nand check out their Pod 3 cover\nand save $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, United Kingdom,\nselect countries in the EU,\nand Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman to save\n$150 at checkout.\nSo what sorts of\nthings should people\nbe thinking about when\ndeveloping an overall fitness\nprogram?\nANDY GALPIN: A few\nminutes ago, we\nwere talking about how two of\nthe major reasons people don't\nget as much out of\ntheir training programs\nas they would like is because\nof one, a lack of adherence,\nand two, a lack of\nprogressive overload.\nSo the solution to\nthat is constructing\na plan that lives within\nyour realistic limitations.\nSo I would like to walk you\nthrough my 10-step approach\nto how I design\ntraining programs.\nNow, before I do that, I\nthink it is fair and important\nfor the audience to\nunderstand that this is simply\nmy approach.\nI've been doing\nthis a long time.\nI played college football.\nAnd I wrote my own training\nprograms back then.\nI have and am still working\nwith professional athletes\nin the PGA TOUR and the NFL,\nthe NBA, Major League Baseball,\nas well as a ton of\ngeneral population folks.\nSo this is a combination\nof the evidence base\nthat we've been\ntalking about in terms\nof best practices for\nstrength and conditioning\nas well as just my\nyears of experience.\nSo there are many, many\nways one could do this.\nI'm not even suggesting\nthis is the best.\nThis is simply how I do it.\nThis is exactly how\nI handle it when\na new individual comes to me\nand how I teach my students.\nSo step number one is assessing\nproperly and identifying\na training goal.\nNow, that's actually\nsort of funny\nbecause we hear that a lot.\nBut a lot of people actually\nnever take that step,\nnot to call anybody\nin the room out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nwhat's happening here\nis this morning\nAndy, Dr. Galpin,\nand I were training together.\nAnd he was providing amazing\ntips on form and set rep\ncadence and the sort of thing.\nAnd he said, so what's your\ntraining goal for the next 12\nmonths?\nAnd I paused.\nAnd it turned into a\nvery long pause because--\nANDY GALPIN: Which\nis an nice way\nof saying he didn't\nhave an answer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ndidn't have an answer.\nOf course, I don't\njust want to maintain\nwhat I've developed in terms\nof strength and hypertrophy\nand endurance.\nBut I don't have a clear goal.\nSo I'm hoping that by the\nend of today's discussion,\nI will be on track to\na clear set of goals.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing.\nI'm not going to\nbore you all here.\nBut, really, I\ncan't stress enough\nhow important that step really\ntruly is to getting results.\nThe analogy we use here\nis if you left your house\nand you were attempting to\nget to the grocery store\nand you just started\ndriving and if you drove\nevery possible route,\nyou would eventually\nget to a grocery store.\nAnd so, yes, that can work.\nA better approach is\nsaying, here's where I am.\nThere's where I want to go.\nWhat is the optimal route there?\nAnd that's really what\nyou're doing with goal.\nSo it is a boring setup.\nIt is not interesting to hear.\nI don't have any real\nhacks or tricks for you.\nBut it is step number\none on purpose.\nWe have to know exactly\nwhere we're going.\nYou can do this in two ways.\nWay number one is to\njust pick something.\nArbitrarily decide\nI'm going to run a 5K.\nOr I've done that\nbefore, and I want\nto improve it by 10 seconds.\nI want to lose 10 pounds.\nYou can just pick one.\nThat's great.\nAnother way is to run through\nthat fitness testing protocol\nwe described a few\nepisodes before.\nAnd if you do that, you can see\nwhich of these areas that maybe\nyou have the largest lagging in.\nOr what is the most\nsevere performance anchor\nis how we refer to it.\nAnd then choose that\nas your primary goal.\nSo either option.\nSome people come in\nto training programs\nwith a very clear goal in mind.\nThey want to add more muscle\nor whatever, whatever.\nOK, great.\nIf you're like, I\ndon't really know,\nI just kind of work out,\nthen run the fitness testing\nprotocol.\nYou'll see what score\nis the lowest end.\nAnd then you'll maybe make\nthat a priority for the next,\nsay, three months.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo the first step\nis to identify a specific or\nset of specific training goals.\nANDY GALPIN: A really\nnice tool for helping\nyou set a goal is a\nsystem called SMART.\nRight now there's a\nlittle bit of debate\non what those acronyms\nactually stand for.\nBut we'll get close enough.\nSo SMART is often Specific,\nMeasurable, Attainable,\nRealistic, and Timely.\nSo starting off with\nS, specific, in general\nthe more specific your goal\nis, the higher likelihood\nyou will have at\nsucceeding in that.\nM, being measurable,\nmeans it needs\nto be something that you can\nactually put a metric on.\nSo this can be\nobjective or subjective.\nBut, generally, I like to have\nat least one objective measure.\nSo remembering\nobjective is something\nthat is not based on feeling.\nIt is not up to you.\nThis could be something\nsimple like your body weight.\nIt could be how\nmuch you can bench\npress, what's your 1\nmile time, whatever\nis most important to you.\nIt actually doesn't have to\nbe a fitness related goal.\nFor example, if\nyou're using fitness\nas a way to enhance your\nsleep, the main metric\nyou may be interested in\nis amount of hours slept.\nIt could be something\nlike efficiency\nor whatever is most interesting.\nIt could be work productivity.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nSo it doesn't have to\nactually be the fitness goal.\nBut what is the motivation\nof why you're doing it?\nSo that's specific, measurable.\nAttainable or actionable,\nas is often described,\nis something that is\nwithin your capability.\nSo attainable-- a bad\nexample of attainable\nis something like, my\ngoal is to win more games.\nThat may not be up to you.\nThe other team\nyou're playing, it\ncould influence it, the\nschedule, et cetera.\nSo attainable\nshould be something\nthat is within your control.\nRealistic or relevant\nto you is something\nthat is, again, something\nrealistic that you can achieve.\nYou wouldn't want\nto make a goal that\nis you want to double\nyour body mass.\nThat is not going to happen.\nSo think about the constraints.\nHow old are you?\nWhat's your training experience?\nHow much time do you really\nhave to invest in this?\nAnd then pick something\nthat is realistic.\nAnd then, honestly,\nmy little twist\nhere is take that in minus 10%.\nBecause, typically, when people\nput together training programs,\ntheir goal tends\nto be quite lofty.\nAnd they get some small\npercentage of the way\nand realize they're never going\nto get there and then back off.\nWe actually-- this\nsort of reminds me\nof a classic deception\nstudy that we\ndid in my lab one time,\nwhere we took people\nand we had them do this\nmaximal front raise.\nBasically, you held a dumbbell\nout in front of you for as long\nas you possibly could.\nAnd the goal here was actually--\nit's a deception study.\nSo we're tricking them.\nAnd so we said, OK,\nwe want to just get\nnormative values to\nsee how long people\ncan hold this front raise.\nAnd I think we use something\nlike 5% of their body weight.\nAnd so they came in.\nAnd they did it one time.\nAnd we timed them.\nThey didn't get\nto see the clock.\nThey left.\nAnd then we said, we've got\nto come back in and repeat it.\nWe got to do a\ncouple of tries here\nto get a normal value in\ncase it's off, whatever.\nWell, the participants were\nsplit up into four groups.\nSo group one actually was told\nthat their time was 15% lower\nthan they actually got.\nGroup two was 5% lower.\nGroup three was 5% higher.\nAnd group four was 15% higher.\nSo the second time\nthey came in to do it,\nour graduate student, quote\nunquote, \"made a mistake\"\nand left the timer\nin front of them.\nSo the first time again\nthey did the exercise,\nthey're just holding it.\nThey don't have any idea\nhow long they're holding it.\nThe second time,\nthey had a giant iPad\nset like just a little\nbit off centered\nwhere they can clearly see it.\nSo they watched the time go by.\nAnd, of course, what happened\nwas those folks, say,\nwho did 1 minute the very\nfirst time when they tested,\nthey came back in to\ndo the second time.\nAnd they're holding it.\nAnd we told them\nthey actually got\n45 seconds, when in reality\nthey had done a minute.\nSo they're holding\nit and holding it.\nAnd they think they\nonly did 45 seconds.\nBy the time they get to\nlike second 40, 41, 42,\nthey get past 45.\nThey almost all quit,\nlike 47, 48 seconds,\nbecause they wanted to\nbeat their previous score\nbut then were like,\ncool, I beat it.\nAnd then they quit early.\nSo they were actually\nnot yet to failure.\nBut they were just\nhappy enough to beat\nwhat they thought they'd done.\nAnd then they quit.\nThe other group on\nthe inverse side--\nagain, say they got a minute.\nWe told them they got a\nminute and 15 seconds.\nThey got to like 45\nseconds, 50 seconds\nand started realizing, oh, man,\nI have 30 more seconds to go.\nAnd they quit way early because\nthe carrot was way too far out.\nThey realized I'm never\ngoing to get there.\nSo I'm just going to stop now.\nCan you guess which group did\nthe best on the post-test?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The ones that\nwere just within about 5% of.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nSo they wanted to improve.\nAnd so, again, say, they\ngot a minute the first time.\nWe told them they\ngot a minute 5--\nor, sorry, they got a\nminute 5 the first time.\nWe told them they\nonly got a minute.\nThey actually\nexceeded that greatly\nbecause they wanted the PR.\nSo making sure that goal\nis properly aligned,\nit needs to be a\nlittle bit scary,\na little bit unrealistic.\nYou're going to have\nto work for this.\nIf it's too easy, you'll quit.\nYou won't feel like a challenge.\nIf it's too hard, though,\nyou'll quit early as well.\nSo you want to make sure it's\nthat reasonable balance of, ah,\nshould I train today?\nOr like maybe I'll\njust go through--\nif I do that, I'm\nnot going to hit.\nI got to get after it.\nBut not like, oh my God, like,\nthere's just no chance here.\nSo you're going to\nwalk away early.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's a\nfantastic study, I have to say.\nIt's very simple.\nI think it illustrates a number\nof important psychological\nprinciples about goal setting,\nmotivation, self perception,\nbut also the dopamine system.\nThe dopamine system is this\nuniversal reward system\nthat-- meaning it\ndoesn't only work\nfor food or only work\nfor fitness goals\nor only work for academic\ngoals or relationship goals.\nIt is the universal\nsubstrate for all of that.\nAnd I actually think there are\nsome real gems of information\nin that study design\nthat you describe.\nSo just cue that for maybe\na potential collaboration\nbetween our\nlaboratories because--\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I\nthink it's very important.\nBut it does cue up another\nquestion relevant to fitness.\nIn particular, which is\nwhat are your thoughts\non intermediate goals?\nSo let's say my goal is\nto drop 2% of body fat\nfrom where I am now\na year from now.\nSo roll into the next year from\nnow about 2% lower on body fat\nbut maintain my lean body mass\nor maybe even increase it.\nHow should I assess progress?\nBecause the dopamine\nsystem loves a goal.\nIt loves anticipation of a goal.\nBut it responds best to, we\nsort of re-up, if you will,\nour dopamine any\ntime we get a signal\nthat we are on the right\ntrack to that goal.\nAnd that signal could be,\nOK, I did the workout.\nI just trust that these\nworkouts are going\nto give me the result I want.\nBut, of course,\nwe know that when\npeople get a glimmer of the\nidea or some objective feedback\nthat they're on the right path,\nthat dopamine system really\nfires and provides\nmotivation for continuing\ntoward the ultimate goal.\nAnd as we've talked about\nin the strength, speed,\nand hypertrophy episode,\nresistance training\nitself has this built into\nit because of the infusion\nof blood into the muscles.\nYou actually get a\nlittle window into what\nyou might get in\nterms of an adaptation\nsimply by way of\nthe so-called pump,\nwhereas endurance type work\ngenerally doesn't have that.\nYou don't see yourself\nget better drop back\nand then adapting to\nactually get better.\nBut that's actually what you\nsee with weight training.\nSo given all of that contour\nof the dopamine system, what\nsorts of intermediate goals\nshould I set for myself\nor should somebody\nset for themselves?\nAnd I realize it will probably\ndepend on the ultimate goal.\nBut would you say check in\non progress once every week,\nevery month, three months?\nANDY GALPIN: I don't know if you\ncan tell the look on my face.\nI love this question\nand this topic.\nI spend so much time on my\nsenior and graduate level\nprogram design course.\nI've been fortunate to\nwork with a few athletes\nwhere we've had multiple years.\nAnd if you can really take\nthe time to step back and go--\nit's not about optimizing\nfor the next six weeks.\nAnd in this case, it's\nnot the next fight.\nIt is the championship\nfight that we\nneed to get to in three years.\nOr it is the Olympics,\nwhich are on a quad program.\nYou're really optimizing\nfor that for a year.\nIf you can have that foresight\nand really think about that\nand then work backwards, you\ncan see some pretty tremendous\nthings.\nThe sort of saying\nthat is we tend\nto overestimate\nwhat we can get done\nin a week and underestimate\nwhat can happen in a year.\nThat can be\nextraordinarily powerful.\nHowever, you have to have\nthose metrics called out ahead\nof time because you will lose\nmotivation in that short term\nbecause you won't see\nthat result immediately.\nBut if you remember, I'm\non a path to 4% or 2%\nor whatever you need to\nbe, therefore, I only\nneed to be this far right now.\nI need to be that far\nand then that far.\nIt's actually quite clear.\nAnd so what we would\nactually do in that scenario,\nnot to go so off track\nhere because I can really\ngo on this stuff, is--\nlet's say it was the\nyear recommendation.\nYou're going to actually need\nto go to the last part of SMART,\nwhich is timely.\nSo part of setting\nthis goal is making\nsure you understand the\ntime domain responsible.\nAnd it's actually\nquite great here\nbecause, not to go\nInception on us,\nwhere we're like\nlist within a list,\nand Rob kills us over here.\nBut number one of this\nprogram design thing\nwas assessing your goal.\nNumber two is identifying\nyour defender.\nWhat I mean by that is,\nwhat is stopping you\nfrom hitting that goal?\nSo you want to lose 2%\nbody fat in the next year.\nOK, great.\nWhat's going to stop us?\nOnce we can achieve\nthat, and we'll\ngo into more of\nthat in a second,\nthen you just start\nwalking that 2% backwards.\nSo you might have to\ngo something like this.\nLook, every time I start\nworking out really hard,\nI always get hurt.\nInteresting.\nOK, great.\nSo maybe instead\nof jumping really\nhard into a high intensity\ninterval training program,\nknowing we're likely to hurt\nsomething or get burnt out\nor quit or whatever the\ndefender is for you, maybe\nwe invest something right\nnow, which is maybe improving\nyour flexibility or working on\nmovement technique, whatever\nis going to stop you\nfrom getting hurt.\nOr maybe we progress slower\nso we don't get there.\nThat will allow us to do\nthe work necessary to hit\nthat goal 12 months from\nnow, not two weeks from now,\nnot two months from now.\nMaybe that's not the case.\nMaybe you're like, no,\nlook, hey, I move well.\nI feel like I'm in decent shape.\nI've got enough\nmuscle mass on me.\nWe've talked in\nprevious episodes\nwhy having insufficient\nmuscle mass\nis sometimes detrimental\nfor fat loss.\nSo you checked all that boxes.\nI don't get hurt very often.\nI got equipment\naround, no problem.\nI've got the time\nin my schedule.\nAnd I have enough muscle.\nGreat.\nWell, now we maybe just\nsplit it up and say,\nlook, we got 12 months.\nWe got 2%.\nIt's as simple as doing\nhalf a percent per quarter\nof the year.\nAnd now all we're looking\nat is that number.\nI don't have to necessarily\nget all these things done.\nI can go a quarter, half\npercent, half percent,\nhalf percent, half percent.\nYou're going to get there.\nThe other scenario that\nI laid out a second ago,\nit maybe needs to look\nlike something like this.\nQuarter one is going to be 0%.\nWell, yeah, that's\nright, you may not\nlose a pound for the\nnext three months.\nWe don't care.\nThat's not the goal\nof these treatments.\nI know that's the\ngoal this year.\nThat's our major\nmacro cycle goal.\nWe're going to get there.\nBut to get there\nmost effectively,\nwe need to invest in working\nmore with your chiropractor\nor whatever the thing is.\nThat will allow us to\nthen go half a percent\nquarter two, when we can\nreally start training.\nBut we're going to ramp into it.\nQuarter three we're going to\ngo another half a percent.\nAnd now we're halfway there.\nQuarter four, we've invested\nso much you're ready to go.\nWe're going to go hard.\nWe're going to get that\nlast 1%, that last quarter.\nAnd we're going to get there.\nAnd you won't be hurt.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that\nmakes it very clear.\nAnd I can also envision\nhow the precise structure\nof these intermediate\ngoals would\nvary depending on what sort\nof adaptation one is pursuing.\nAnd I do remember from\nour previous episodes\nthat fat loss itself\nis not an adaptation.\nIt is a byproduct of\nother adaptations.\nSo I just want to make\nsure that you know\nthat I was paying attention.\nIt's committed to memory.\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Some\ngoals, such as fat loss,\nare very quantifiable.\nAnd yet, they might\nnot be linear.\nIt's hard to know--\nthe assumption is if you\ningest x fewer calories than\nare required per day, then\nyou'll lose x amount of weight,\nsome percentage from body fat.\nI think that cues\nup the idea that we\nneed to build some\nflexibility into our thinking\nabout these intermediate goals\nin order to just make sure\nthat dopamine system isn't\ntethered to exact numbers\nbecause after all a\nreduction in 2% body fat,\nfor instance, is really\na desire to achieve\na different sort of overall body\ncomposition or recomposition.\nI don't know, by the way,\nthat that's my exact goal.\nI think one of my goals is to\nbe able to run a mile faster.\nAnd I'm sort of haunted\nby this experience\nof wanting to run\ncross-country in college\nand trying to walk on.\nWe weren't a Division I school.\nBut the threshold for being\nconsidered for the team\nwas you had to run a sub\n10-minute 2 mile, which turns\nout to be very, very fast.\nANDY GALPIN: That's really hard.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI did not do that.\nI didn't even come close.\nAnd I don't think that I\ncould reasonably do that now.\nI'm not interested in committing\nto the kind of training\nrequired.\nThe sacrifice isn't\nmeaningful enough for me.\nANDY GALPIN: Fair and honest.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nlowering one's time\nto run a mile by,\nI don't know, 10%\nseems like a reasonable\ngoal across six months.\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nSo in the case of a\ngoal like that, clearly\nthere are specific\ntraining programs.\nBut this raises\nthe issue of, what\nif I have other goals as well?\nAnd at what point\ndo people having\nmultiple goals start to set\nup collisions between goals?\nHow do we know whether or\nnot something is reasonable\nnot just on its own but because\nof the other things that one\nhas structured\ninto their program.\nSo being able to reduce a mile\ntime by 10% in six months,\nOK, maybe that's doable.\nMaybe it's not.\nYou can tell me.\nBut also being able to\ndouble the amount that they\ncan do for single repetition\nleg extension for that matter,\nat the same time those seem\nlike incompatible goals.\nANDY GALPIN: So a\ncouple of things.\nNumber one, the more\nspecific and precise\nyou can be with a\nsingle goal, the faster\nyou will get there, generally.\nSo in theory, if you had one\nthing you wanted to achieve,\nthe best way to go about\nit is to focus on that.\nGive it the most priority.\nThat doesn't mean you can't do\nanything else along the way.\nYou can.\nBut you would want\nto focus on that.\nThe more additional\ngoals you bring in,\nthe more distraction you're\ncreating for that primary goal.\nDepending on what\nthose goals are,\nyou can actually do\nthem at the same time.\nSome other combinations\nare less effective.\nThink about it like this.\nWe went through those\nnine adaptations.\nAnd we went through them in\na specific order on purpose.\nThe closer those adaptations\nare together in that list,\nthe more compatible they\nare to training each other.\nThe further away, they\nbecome more challenging.\nSo just to give a few examples.\nIf you wanted to improve\nyour speed in power,\nyou could basically train\nthose simultaneously.\nThey would not interfere\nwith each other at all.\nAnd, in fact, since power\nis speed times force,\nit would be complementary.\nIf you just walk down\nthe line from there\nto strength, hey, same thing.\nIf you get faster, that's\ngoing to aid in strength\nbecause force is mass\ntimes acceleration.\nSo if you improve\nacceleration, you're\ncontributing to strength.\nSame thing with power.\nSo speed, power, and\nstrength are generally\nvery complementary.\nYou can absolutely train\nall three of those goals\nat the same time\nand have no issues.\nGetting into\nhypertrophy, now we've\ngot a little bit of distinction.\nIf you're going to train\nstrength and hypertrophy, as we\ntalked about in that\nepisode, at the base\nthose are going to\nbe complementary.\nYou add on some muscle.\nYou're going to get stronger.\nYou start training for strength.\nIt's probably going to help\nyou out on some muscle mass.\nAs you get to the\nend of that spectrum,\nthe overlap between\nthe two starts\nto go away, such\nthat if you truly\nwanted to maximize strength\nabove everything else,\nif you continue to train\nfor hypertrophy as well,\nthat's going to take\ntoo many resources out\nof your recovery bin.\nAnd you won't be\nable to do that.\nThe inverse would\nalso be the same.\nIf you're training\nto maximize strength,\nyou wouldn't be able\nto put enough volume on\nto get sufficient hypertrophy.\nSo if you wanted to then\ncombine speed with hypertrophy,\nyou're going farther\naway from each other,\nwhich means it's going to be\nmore and more distraction.\nSo the hypertrophy training\nwould cause a ton of fatigue.\nYou wouldn't be able to go\nat max speed for your speed\nor power strength.\nSo you're going to be\ncompromising those results.\nNow, speed training\nwon't compromise\nyour hypertrophy training\nbecause it's non fatiguing.\nAnd so, boom, here\nwe have a little bit\nof an interference effect one\nway but probably not the other.\nLet's move down the\nspectrum one more time\nand get into endurance.\nWe won't go through\nall of these things.\nBut you're getting\nthe idea here.\nOh, a little bit of high\nintensity intervals?\nOK, cool.\nNow, would that compromise\nmy speed, power, or strength?\nProbably because there's a\nlittle bit of residual fatigue.\nIf the volume was low\nenough, then you'd be fine.\nAll you're worried about\nthere is not necessarily\nlike some sort of\ncellular mechanism.\nIt's just simple fatigue.\nIt is amount of\nenergy expenditure\nversus is that compromising\nmy recovery to come back.\nWould those first three\nor four of those-- speed,\npower, strength--\ninterfere with your ability\nto elevate your\nanaerobic capacity?\nProbably not.\nAlmost surely, in\nfact, if you look\nat any of the literature\non endurance training,\nyou will see that speed, power,\nand strength almost always\nimprove endurance.\nEndurance training added on top\nof strength can be detrimental,\ncan have a neutral\neffect, but generally\ndoesn't help one get stronger by\nadding additional conditioning\nunless you're so unfit you can't\nget through the volume needed\nin the strength training.\nOne more example here so we\ndon't drag this out too far.\nIn the case of something like\nI want to lose fat, well, hey,\nwe don't have to worry\nabout interference.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nIf you're fatigued for\nyour hypertrophy session,\nnot a big deal.\nWe're just trying to\nget some work done.\nIf your hypertrophy\nsession fatigued you\nfrom your\nconditioning, it's cool\nbecause you got the work done.\nSo you don't have to\nworry about it so much.\nSo it really kind of\ndepends on the actual goal.\nAnd what you want\nto pay attention to\nis, actually, what are the\nchances of overlap, which\nmeans like what are\nthe adaptations you\nget physiologically that cross\nover from one to the other?\nAnd then what are the\nones that are actually\ngoing to start interfering?\nIn fact, in my class, I\nhave this giant matrix chart\nof interference effect\ngoing from adaptations\nthrough a whole bunch\nof systems, everything\nfrom handling pH to\nlymphatic drainage\nto bone marrow\ndensity, et cetera.\nYou can walk through\nthese whole things\nand see which ones actually have\na positive effect, which ones\nhave a massive positive\neffect, and then\nwhich ones actually have a\nlittle bit of an interference.\nAnd perhaps if you\nguys are nice enough,\nwe could throw that into\na newsletter or something,\nsome PDF or something.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think that\nwould be immensely valuable.\nI think some of that more\nextensive information,\nwhen it's laid out in grid form\nlike that is really useful.\nSo we should-- well,\nnow we've said it.\nSo we--\nANDY GALPIN: I didn't\nsay I would do it.\nI said perhaps.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nthink it's a great idea.\nI think it's a terrific idea.\nThe idea that items\ncloser to each other\non the list of those nine\ndifferent adaptations\nare going to be easier to\nachieve in parallel than items\nfurther apart makes\nperfect sense.\nAnd what I heard was that\nthere's a few caveats that\nmight seem minor.\nBut they're actually\nquite important,\nsuch as anything that is\nrelatively low intensity\nand doesn't impede\nrecovery can probably\nbe included as a parallel goal.\nSo some speed work\nin conjunction\nwith some long duration cardio\nwork, versus even though we're\ntalking about number 2 on that\nlist and number 9 on that list.\nANDY GALPIN: In that\ncase, the long duration\nendurance, even if\nit's low intensity,\nmay actually interfere\nwith the speed\nif the volume gets too high.\nIf you're talking about,\nI went on a 30 minute jog,\nfor most people,\nit's totally fine.\nWhat we're really\ntalking about here\nis when the miles\nstart piling up.\nAnd the time really starts\ngetting there in combination\nwith some of the\nthings-- the factors\nwe've talked about earlier,\nwhich is exercise choice.\nSo more eccentric landing\nbased exercise choices.\nRunning, for example, is\nmore likely to interfere\nthan cycling because\nyou're not landing.\nSwimming is low impact.\nSo if you're going\nto do those things,\nyou can hedge your bets a little\nbit by choosing an exercise\nchoice that is less impactful.\nAgain, if we're literally--\nbecause there's oftentimes\nconfusing here is like,\noh, don't do 10 minutes\non the treadmill\nbefore you lift.\nYou're going to cut--\noh, time out.\nWarm up is fine.\nWe're really talking about\nprobably more than 30\nplus minutes at higher\nthan 60% heart rate--\nrandom number,\nsomething like that,\ndepends on the\nperson, et cetera.\nBut it has to be a decent chunk.\nAgain, you can actually fix\nthat by then just consuming\ncalories.\nYou can also fix that by\nmaking sure everything\nelse in the hidden and visible\nstressor bucket is improved.\nSo that's just like\none of our tricks\nthat we'll get into when\nwe get to the recovery,\nis you don't necessarily need\nto reduce your training if you\njust ramp up your recovery.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand acknowledge our\nsponsor Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic and adaptogen\ndrink designed to\nhelp you meet all\nof your foundational\nnutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens daily since 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\na sponsor of this podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic\nGreens once or twice a day\nis that it helps me meet all\nof my foundational nutritional\nneeds.\nThat is, it covers my\nvitamins, my minerals.\nAnd the probiotics are\nespecially important to me.\nAthletic Greens also\ncontains adaptogens,\nwhich are critical for\nrecovering from stress,\nfrom exercise, from work,\nor just general life.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five\nfree travel packs.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2.\nAgain, if you'd like\nto try Athletic Greens,\ngo to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer.\nI'm going to take the liberty of\nassuming that most people fall\ninto one of either three\nbins in terms of their goals,\nagain, most people.\nCertainly, there are\ngoing to be people\nthat lie outside these bins.\nI think if you polled 100 people\nor 100,000 or 1 million people\nas to what their major\ngoals were in working out,\nthey'd say, as you so\nnicely listed out before,\naesthetic changes,\nfunctionality, and longevity.\nBut that one in three\nreally kind of sit higher\nthan most people would\nlike to perhaps even admit.\nThey want to look good,\nwhich usually means\nthey want to lose some fat, gain\nsome muscle in specific places.\nI realize there\nare folks out there\nwho want to gain a lot of muscle\nand just muscle everywhere.\nBut I think most\npeople would like\nto have a little more\nshape here, a little more\nmuscle there to either\nbalance out their aesthetic\nor to accentuate certain\nparts of their physique.\nAnd they would probably\nlike to shave off\nsome subcutaneous fat, although\nthere are those exceptionally\nlean people out there.\nAnd they exist too.\nI think it would be gain\nmuscle in specific places,\nlose fat, and do\nit in a way that\nalso provides some boost\nto their health span\nand longevity.\nI would say that that might\neven be 50% of people out there.\nAgain, I'm taking the\nliberty of guesstimating.\nAnother bin I would venture is\ninterested in getting stronger\nand putting on more muscle.\nCertainly, there are a\nnumber of people that\nare interested in doing that.\nAnd that could\neven be more muscle\nall over or more muscle\nwith some accentuation\nto certain areas\nwhere they happen\nto be weaker or less\ndeveloped, as it were.\nAnd then the third bin\nwould be people that really\nenjoy cardiovascular work.\nOh, I should say the\nsecond bin probably care\nabout their longevity also.\nBut it's not really foremost,\nlike, yeah, I feel great now,\nand I'll live to be whatever.\nBut I only want to do it\nif I get that much muscle.\nWe know these kinds of folks.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I run a\npoll in my class every year\nwhen I ask, what,\nyou guys all lift?\nAnd, of course, I make\nthem put their hand up,\nlike, you guys are\nin my class, you're\ngoing to put your hand\nup, let you lift weights.\nAnd then I ask,\nwhy do you train?\nAnd long term health\nis like on the list.\nAnd they all--\nI'm like any of you that\nselected health are liars.\nYou're 20 to 25.\nYou are not\nexercising for health.\nYou are exercising because\nyou want to look a certain way\nor get stronger.\nOnce you get past that\nundergraduate age,\nthough, the actual desire to\nlive longer and better actually\nbecomes pretty real.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nI think that there are\npeople who want to feel better.\nThey know that exercise and\nthe results from exercise\ncan make them feel better.\nBut, yeah, that second bin\ntends to be more focused\non the aesthetic changes,\nit seems, or being strong.\nAnd then the third category,\nI think, are people--\nI know a lot of\nfolks like this, who\nreally enjoy what are normally\nconsidered endurance type\nactivities.\nAnd here I just want\nto highlight again\nwhat you so\nbeautifully illustrated\nin previous episodes, that you\ncan gain a lot of endurance\neven using weights or machines.\nIt just depends on\nhow you use them.\nIt's not about the exercise.\nIt's about how you perform\nthem and et cetera.\nAnd you, again, beautifully\nprovided all those details\nas how to create endurance\nregardless of equipment\nstandards, et cetera.\nBut that third\ncategory seem to be\npeople who enjoy running,\ncycling, swimming, hiking,\ndancing, activities\nthat they can\ndo for long periods of time.\nThat often will\ninvolve some sort\nof skill that is based on\nimproving motor patterns,\nmaybe not so much\nstride but certainly\nfor people that really\nlove tennis, people\nthat love a sport, like golf.\nThey want to be able\nto not just walk.\nThey want to walk the 18 holes.\nThey want to have a great\ngolf swing, et cetera.\nI'm not a golf player.\nSo forgive me if my\nnomenclature is off.\nSo there are three--\nANDY GALPIN: Golfer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, golfers.\nANDY GALPIN: You\ndon't play golf.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, got it.\nYou don't play golf.\nANDY GALPIN: Well,\nyou play golf.\nYou wouldn't call a golf player.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I played\nminiature golf a few times.\nAnd that's about it,\nalthough Stanford\ndoes have a beautiful\ngolf course, I'm told.\nI should learn how to play golf.\nANDY GALPIN: I'll come up and\nplay it for you if you want.\nYou come up.\nI'll play it.\nI'll tell you how it goes.\nGet me on that course.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I can\nalmost see it from my lap.\nSo category one, I think, is a\nsignificant fraction of people.\nSo as we lay out these\ndifferent ways to assess goals\nand as we approach the\nstructure of a program,\nas you'll tell us-- if we could\nperhaps touch back to those\nevery once in a while.\nAgain, I'm taking the\nliberty of assuming\nthat we will net about 80% to\n90% of people out there, again,\nthose categories being people\nwho want to lose some fat,\nmaybe build some muscle in\nspecific areas on their body,\nand really want to be healthy.\nThey want to feel great.\nAnd they want to have a long\nhealth span and lifespan.\nThey want to live a\nlong time feeling great.\nSecond category, people want to\nbuild more muscle and strength.\nSure, they don't want\nto damage their health.\nBut that's not their main focus.\nTheir main focus is on\nbuilding muscle and strength.\nAnd then that third\ncategory of people\nwho really want to do more\nendurance type work, feel\ngreat and strong\ndoing it but not\nbecause they can carry heavy\nweights while they're doing it.\nBut rather, they can\nfeel vital and they\ncan push harder for longer\nand maybe even translate that\nto some of the more recreational\ntype activities or sports,\nlike tennis, and things\nthat are more long duration,\nplaying soccer or\nmaybe even softball\nor things of that sort.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nsurfing, swimming.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So those\nthree categories-- maybe we\ncould call those bin A, B, and C\nfor sake of today's discussion.\nI think if you're\nwilling to embrace--\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I love it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --I think\nthat will be informative toward\nour listeners in a way that--\nsimply not assuming what\npeople's different goals are\nmight not be able to accomplish.\nSaid differently,\nhopefully, by doing that,\npeople will derive a lot\nmore from the description\nof the program that\nyou're going to give us.\nANDY GALPIN: Love it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now,\nI am certain that I\nwant to let you return to\nyour list of the five things\nthat people need to consider\nwhen establishing a exercise\nprogram.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\ngreat, let's do that.\nI also do want to acknowledge\na point you've brought up.\nExercise doesn't mean\njust lifting weights.\nThat's my background.\nThat's what I spend my time on.\nSo I sort of default to\nexamples in that category.\nBut it doesn't have to be that.\nYou've articulated\nplenty of other ways\nwhere you can get amazing forms\nof exercise that have nothing\nto do with lifting weights.\nSo for those folks in--\nwas it bin C or 3?\nI can't remember it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Bin C.\nWe go A is, again, muscle,\nlose fat, be healthy\nnow and forever.\nBin B is get\nstronger, gain muscle,\ndon't damage your health, but\nnot really focus on health\nin the immediate term.\nAnd then bin C is want to play\nor do endurance type activities\nand, quote unquote,\n\"feel strong doing it,\"\nso have more vigor to be\nable to do that longer\nand maybe with more attention\nto skill, et cetera,\nand, of course, also want\nto improve their health.\nANDY GALPIN: Well, what\nyou've effectively done\nis you've given us three\ndifferent avatars with three\ndifferent goals.\nSo the next step for\neach person or group\nis going to be to\nidentify their defenders.\nBut before we get\nthat, we've got\nto close the loop\non this SMART thing.\nSo in each case,\nthey have either\nchosen that goal based on\ntheir personal preference.\nOr perhaps they did our\nfitness testing protocol\nand realized they\nneed to gain strength.\nSo whether the reason they\nchose to be in buckets B or A\nor C was because of our protocol\nor just personal preference.\nIt really doesn't matter.\nThey still want to go through\nthis process of laying out\ntheir goals and making sure,\nagain, they are specific.\nSo let's go through bin\nC, which is a great one.\nSo you want to have more energy.\nAnd you want to\nfeel stronger when\nyou're doing your kiteboarding.\nYou want to feel\nstronger when you\nfinish your round of tennis,\nround of golf, game of tennis.\nOK, great.\nThat's a different strength.\nAbsolutely see, I hear, I know\nwhat you're saying though.\nAmazing.\nSo that goal needs to\nbe specific to that.\nSo it would be hard to make\na goal like, I want to feel\nbetter at the end of my round.\nBoy, that depends on\ntoo many other factors.\nA better goal would be\nsomething like this.\nI want to be able to run\nthis 2-mile loop that I\ndo around my neighborhood.\nAnd I want to do it and have\na lower heart rate at the end.\nOr I want to be able\nto get my heart rate\nrecovery back faster.\nAmazing, that will probably\nalign with you feeling,\nquote unquote,\n\"stronger\" with it.\nSo I did the same course.\nAnd either I could do\nit at the same speed\nand it's not nearly as hard or\nI can go faster, whichever one.\nIt doesn't matter.\nBut that would be an\nexample of a specific goal.\nThe other buckets you\nlaid out kind of already\nhave specific goals, like\nI want to get stronger.\nWell, that's going\nto be the goal.\nThe other one is going to\nbe, I want to lose some fat.\nThe goal is sort of\nimplicit in that.\nIt's the other people\nwhere you're just like,\nI don't really care about that.\nI just want to be able\nto surf the great waves\nand then not feel\nexhausted afterwards.\nAll right, cool.\nWell, then you still\nshould pick a metric\nthat is not that activity\nmaybe because it won't\nbe within your\ncontrol, depending\non the waves and the\ntemperature and all that stuff,\nthat you can use as a proxy to\nsay, if I were to do something\nthat represented me feeling\nprobably better when I surf,\nwhat would that be?\nAnd it's not perfect.\nBut it would be still as\nspecific as you could get.\nYou still want to make\nsure it's measurable.\nAgain, this example\nmight be something\nlike you're going to\ngo to the pool and time\nhow long it takes you to\nswim 800 meters or something.\nIt's attainable.\nAnd then you'll set a goal\nthat's realistic and timely.\nI'm going to improve by\n5% in the next two months.\nOK, cool, that probably\nfalls in the realm.\nAnd then you're\nmaking the assumption\nthat if you did\nthat, you'll probably\nfeel better when you go out to\ndo your primary activity, which\nis, say, surf.\nThe reality of it\nis every time we\nwork with an actual\nathlete, that's what we do.\nAthletes don't come\nto us to lift weights.\nThey don't come to\nus to get stronger.\nThey come to us because\nthey want to play better.\nAnd they want to stay\non the field more.\nWhat we're trying\nto convince them of\nis if you do this\nthing in the gym, then\nthat should translate into you\nbeing better at your sport,\nrecovering faster,\nbeing less injured.\nBut it's still just a proxy.\nAnd so that's all you're doing\nwith these other non-specific\ngoals, especially when they're\nperformance based goals.\nAnd we didn't\npackage it that way.\nBut that's really what you\ntalked about for bin C there.\nIt is a performance based goal.\nI want to be able to perform\nwhen I'm in the field.\nIn my brain, that's a sport.\nIn your brain, it's when\nyou're at yoga class.\nIt's the same thing.\nWe've said this earlier in our\nseries that if you have a body,\nyou're an athlete.\nI want to prepare your\nbody so that it can do\nexactly what you want it to do.\nYou then get to have the choice\nof what you ask it to do.\nYou call it a sport.\nYou call it your Saturday\nhike with your family.\nI don't really care.\nIt's the same thing.\nYou get control of\nyour body performing\nthe way you want it to perform.\nAnd that's what this\nwhole thing is about.\nGreat.\nSo now that we've\ncovered, I think,\nas much as we need to regarding\nassessing and choosing a goal,\nI want to get back to this idea\nof identifying your defender.\nSo you really need\nto think carefully\nabout what is stopping you\nfrom hitting those goals.\nAnd so you're\nforecasting a little bit.\nYou're also going back into\nyour own personal history.\nDo you have history\nof knee pain?\nDo you have a history\nof working too much?\nDo you have a history\nof a lot of travel?\nDo you have a history\nof getting sick a lot?\nWhat are these things\nthat are happening\nthat are going to stop you\nfrom hitting your goal?\nA couple of examples\nI've already\nlaid out so we don't need\nto go too much longer here.\nBut in the case of somebody\nwho is in maybe bin A, which\nis I want to lose\nsome fat, maybe\ngain a little bit of\nmuscle, OK, what's\nstopping you from the strength\nand conditioning side?\nIs it the fact that you can't\ntrain consistent enough?\nIs it the fact that\nwhen you go to train,\nyou don't know what to do?\nIs it the fact that\nwhen you go to train,\nyou train your ass off and\nyou're not getting results.\nOK, great.\nAll three of these\ndifferent scenarios\nare going to result\nin different programs\nbecause they have different\nreasons you're failing.\nAnd that is really critical.\nInstead of just going I\nwant a fat loss program\nand picking one up\noff the internet,\nit may not actually\nbe addressing\nthe point of failure for you.\nSo the sooner you can\nchoose your programs\nbased on why you're\nfailing, the sooner\nyou'll start getting results.\nYou have to run a little bit\nof a critical analysis there.\nAnd it can be\nsomething scientific.\nAnd it could be a measurement.\nAnd it also could\njust be thinking\nabout you've tried this in the\npast and why didn't it work.\nIt wasn't that interesting.\nOK, tell me more about\nwhy it wasn't interesting.\nI'm not really into machines.\nAnd that's all I had.\nOK, great.\nOr I loved it.\nI loved the gym I was at.\nAnd I was getting results.\nBut it was so far away.\nOK, interesting.\nWhy did you stop before?\nWhy didn't it work?\nOr if it did work in\nthe past, amazing.\nLet's go back to\nsomething similar.\nBut has your life\nchanged at all?\nIs there anything different\nabout now than when\nit worked three years ago?\nYes, no.\nIf not, maybe we\nrun it right back.\nIf it is, OK, we're going\nto predict those things.\nAnd you want to work--\neffectively, what I'm saying is\nthroughout this entire 10-step\nprocess is going to be\nyou want to make sure\nthat there are the\nnon-negotiables that\nare in your life that you\nknow are going to be ahead\nof your fitness program.\nAnd you want to work with\nthose things, not against them\nbecause life will win.\nWhen it comes to your children,\nwhen it comes to your job,\nlife is going to win.\nYou're going to have\nto give up something.\nIt's going to take\nsome hard work.\nBut we want to fight the\nright battles for most people.\nEven for our\nprofessional athletes,\nwe get this all the time.\nIt's just like they have\nnothing else to do but train.\nLike, whoa, whoa, hold on\nnow, they're getting traded.\nThey have agents to deal with.\nThey may not have a contract.\nThey have families,\nblah, blah, blah.\nLife will get in\nthe way, I promise.\nAnd so you want to fight the\nbattles that you can win,\nnot ones that you're\ngoing to lose.\nAnd so that's really\nwhat this game is about.\nSo if the battle is, hey, my\njob is super hectic, OK, great.\nWe're going to come up with\na different strategy that's\nmore flexible maybe.\nI'm still going to\nhold you to the fire.\nI'm not going to\nbe easier on you.\nBut we're just not going to try\nto set up a situation where you\nhave to do this workout Monday,\nWednesday, Friday, and Saturday\nbecause you know your\njob is on the road.\nAnd you're to provide all\nincome for your family, whatever\nthe thing is.\nThat's what we really\nwant to identify.\nSo when I say identify\nyour defenders,\nyou need to run a little bit\nof a critical analysis on this.\nAnd a little bit of a\ntool I'll use for this\nis a modification\nof another system\nI stole from Kenny\nCain, which is what\nwe call the quadrant system.\nSo you can imagine\neverything in your life\ngoes into one of four buckets.\nNow, bucket 1 I'm just\ngoing to call business.\nAnd this is anything to\ndo with your job, income,\nsort of all those things.\nBucket 2 is relationships.\nSo, again, this could be\nfamily or love life, anything\nthat we would call\nrelationships--\nsocial connection,\npurpose, anything, right?\nBucket 3 is your fitness.\nAnd bucket 4 is your recovery.\nSo one of the first steps we\ntake is we walk through this.\nAnd we say, all right,\nyou have 10 points total.\nAnd you get to distribute\nthese 10 points across the four\nareas.\nSo not 10 each,\nyou get 10 total.\nAnd so we walk through.\nAnd we say, right now, where\nare you giving your points?\nAnd we could do this right\nnow for you if you'd like.\nOr I could make up a scenario.\nYou want to do it?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sure.\nANDY GALPIN: Great.\nSo, Andrew, right now\nin the last month,\nif you had 10 points total\nin those four categories,\nwhere would you be\ndistributing the most points?\nWhich category?\nAnd how many points\nwould that be?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBusiness, my work.\nANDY GALPIN: Business, work\njob, sort of all those things.\nAnd how many out of 10?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhich doesn't, I\nshould say, ever\nquite feel like work.\nRunning a laboratory\nand doing the podcast\ndoesn't ever really feel like\nwork in the traditional sense.\nBut it's career.\nIt's work.\nIt involves relationships.\nBut it certainly doesn't\nenhance my fitness\nexcept of my vocal\nchords and recovery.\nSo with those notes\nthere, I would say 4 to 5.\nANDY GALPIN: You pick.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 5.\nANDY GALPIN: 5, fair.\nThat's the most common\nnumber, business 5.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nOnce again, I'm typical,\nwhich makes me happy.\nANDY GALPIN: You nailed it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOne of the few ways\nin which I've been\naccused of being normal.\nI pick 5 for business.\nANDY GALPIN: No kidding.\nWhat's the next highest?\nAnd what's that score?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I do\ninvest in relationships.\nI would say does it\nhave to be around--\ncan it be--\nANDY GALPIN: It has\nto be a whole integer.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nA whole integer.\n2.\nANDY GALPIN: 2, all right,\nwe're 7 out of 10 here.\nSo would you say\nit is fair that you\nspend roughly 2 and 1/2 percent\nof your-- it's not necessarily\ntime.\nIt's energy, time, focus, and\nsort of all of these things--\n2 and 1/2 times as much\non your business as you\ndo in your relationships?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It varies,\ndepending on what's going on.\nIt feels a little skewed in\nthe direction of business.\nSo I might want to adjust\nto a 4 to 3 ratio there.\nANDY GALPIN: Maybe not.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I think\nI'm going to hold to 5, 2,\nbusiness, relationships.\nAnd then, just for\nsake of example\nand because this doesn't seem\nlike an exceedingly precise\nmeasure, it can have some slop.\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nWhere would you put\nfitness and recovery?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I definitely\nput energy into fitness.\nSo I'm going to\ngive that also a 2.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep, which leaves?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 1 for recovery.\nANDY GALPIN: Great.\nThat what you just\nlaid out is, again,\nthe most quintessential\nsplit you could have.\nIn fact, you run this\ngame on everyone,\nthey're going to come up with\nbasically the same answer\nunless they don't\nwork out or whatever.\nSo a couple of rules here.\nRecovery must be at minimum\nhalf of your fitness allocation.\nIn your case, 2 to 1.\nYou're fine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think I'm\ngoing to say it has to be half.\nIt has to be 5 out of 10 points.\nANDY GALPIN: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In which\ncase, it doesn't leave much\nfor anything else.\nANDY GALPIN: I would\nlike it to be minimum 20%\nof the total, which\nmeans 2 out of 10.\nNow, when I say recovery,\nI don't simply mean muscle.\nI mean you need personal time.\nYou need meditation.\nYou need--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sleep.\nANDY GALPIN: --sleep.\nYou need to go to a concert\nand get out and see people.\nAnd so like whatever the things\nthat give you energy back.\nSome folks, that's\npersonal time.\nSome folks, that's\nsocial time, whatever\nthat means to you, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I\nactually get a lot of energy\nfrom my work.\nAnd so that's why some of these\nnumbers are a little bit--\nyou can kind of cloak\nthe underlying dynamics.\nANDY GALPIN: So here's\nwhat we do from this game.\nWe look at that and we say, if\nthat's our split, Andrew, 5, 3,\n2, 1--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 5, 2, 2, 1.\nANDY GALPIN: 5, 2, 2, 1.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd\nlove to be able to put 3\nin relationships just because.\nBut then they need 11 out of--\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nSo here's the fun game we play.\nYou're currently at this.\nAnd you don't get to add to 11.\nYou have to stay at 10.\nYour 10 is different\nthan my 10 maybe, right?\nBut 10 is 10, or just--\nwhatever the maximum\nyou can actually do.\nIt's you.\nSo if we went back to our\ntraining goal, whatever\nthat goal was for you, and we\nwent back to our defenders,\nwe would look at this score\nnow and say, is 3 out of 10--\nfitness is 3, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fitness is 2.\nSo it's 5, 2, 2, 1.\nANDY GALPIN: Is 2 out of 10\nsufficient to hit that training\ngoal in that time\nframe you described?\nAnd let's say you said, I want\nto hit a new PR in my mile\nsix months from now.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nfor simplicity's sake\nand also because\nit's largely true,\nI'm going to put myself in what\nI refer to as bin A earlier.\nMy body fat percentage is OK.\nIt's in the range\nthat I would like.\nBut I would like to bring\nit down a little bit,\nprobably gain a little\nbit muscle here and there,\nkeep or gain some endurance.\nAnd, certainly, certainly, my\nimmediate and long term health\nare extremely important to me.\nANDY GALPIN: Great.\nSo then the question,\nand the answer\nmaybe yes, that this is\nthe optimal split for you.\nIf it is not, then we\nhave to make a choice.\nWe either alter the goal or the\ntimeline to make it realistic\nor we alter our quadrant.\nAnd then if we're going\nto alter our quadrant,\nthe next step is\ncritically important.\nWe need a list of very\nspecific life actions\nthat we're going to take that\nallows that split to happen.\nSo if you said, for\nexample, I want to put three\ninto relationships, great.\nWhat specific life\nactions are you\ngoing to take to pull\none from fitness--\nyou can't pull any from\nrecovery or one from business.\nAnd you don't have\nto actually answer.\nThis is--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Too personal.\nANDY GALPIN: I know you don't\nlike making these things\nabout you because--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right, that's\nthe other reason to do it.\nAnd it is a diabolical\ntrick to insist\nthat these be whole\nintegers because I\nwould have done like a\n4.5 for business and a 2.5\nfor relationships.\nBut, obviously, you write\nthe rules on this, not me.\nANDY GALPIN: So you would\njust walk that list.\nAnd the list could be\nsomething like I promise to not\nwork after 7:00 PM\nThursday through Sunday\nor whatever the thing is.\nI promise I'm going to make\nsure that I don't start work\nbefore 8:00 AM or blah,\nblah, blah, whatever.\nNo more trips.\nJust make those things\nspecific and measurable,\nnot just like I'm\ngoing to work less.\nThat's never going to go--\nwhat is the very specific life\naction you're going to take?\nThere's going to be alarm\nthat goes off Tuesday\nnight at 4:00, 5:00 PM.\nAnd no matter what we--\nat Barbell Shrugged, we used\nto have a little shirt that\nwas like D3AT, which\nis like drop everything\nand train, which means at\n3:00 PM in the afternoon,\nno matter what's happening,\nwe dropped everything\nand trained because that was\nlike when you start a business\nand you're going, things\njust run away from you.\nAnd it is just sort of like,\nman, it's not my company.\nBut those guys are like, we\nare a strength and conditioning\ncompany.\nAnd we're not training.\nSo we had to just\nmake this hard rule.\nAnd it was just like a\nlittle thing that came up.\nAnd it was easy to say drop\neverything and train 3:00.\nThere you go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I like\nthis drop D, E everything, A\nand, blank, like it could\nbe drop everything and--\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--pick your favorite.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nDrop everything and read.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Pick the\nrelevant-- read, yeah,\nabsolutely.\nI really miss\nreading for pleasure.\nI would put that\nunder recovery and--\nANDY GALPIN: Drop\neverything and breathe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, and\nbreathe you are saying.\nOh, and breathe.\nI was saying read.\nANDY GALPIN: I said that too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, because\nfor me, reading is actually\nis both recovery\nand relationship.\nBecause oftentimes\nin my relationships,\nI've insisted-- not insisted.\nI certainly didn't insist.\nWe've had a format of reading\nthe same book in parallel.\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not\nnecessarily side by side\nbut the same book in parallel\nand then discussing it.\nIt's a wonderful\npractice or listening\nto the same audio book.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nit works well.\nYou can do drop\neverything and play.\nYou're just going\nto go do something.\nYou're going to\nplay video games.\nYou're going to go\nplay with your kid.\nYou're going to-- do you\nwant to play with your dog?\nIt doesn't even have\nto actually be play.\nBut play to you could\nsignify personal time.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nSo, yeah, that's it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I really\nlike this drop everything\nand blank category\nthat you probably\nshouldn't have more than what?\nTwo or three of those overall?\nANDY GALPIN: Pretty\nmuch one to two maybe\nis where you want\nto go after that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo the idea is then\nto redistribute the\nnumbers on this list\nbut through a very\nconcrete action.\nAnd I like this drop\neverything and blank\nbecause it speaks to the\nnon-negotiable aspect of it.\nANDY GALPIN: Has to be.\nLife will get pushed.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nnot a fine time to--\nit's not in next\nyear I'm going to--\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.\nWhen you put those things--\nthose things, you might\nas well just don't even\nput it on your list right.\nIt's not going to happen.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, you're talking\nto somebody who loves rules.\nBecause when they are\nnon-negotiable rules,\nthey provide this incredible\norganizing force for the brain.\nIt's really a neuroscience\nthing in my mind.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And, actually,\nwe did an episode on happiness\nwhere you find that once\npeople make a decision, if they\neliminate the possibility\nof other decisions, like,\nliterally, the hatch\nis closed, that is it--\nANDY GALPIN: Burn the boats.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --the rates\nof subjective happiness,\nimmediate and long\nterm happiness,\nover time go way, way up.\nAnd so I'm convinced\nthat the nervous system\ndoesn't like to keep the valves\non these dopamine circuits\nopen.\nI actually think it diminishes\nfrom the reward component.\nAnd there are actually\nsome data on this.\nAnyway, I don't want\nto take us off track.\nANDY GALPIN: The\nlast part of this,\nwhat we do then is we\ntake that quadrant.\nAnd we take that list.\nAnd then you're going\nto print it physically.\nAnd you're going to\nput it in two places.\nThis could actually\nbe on your phone.\nYou don't have to print it.\nYou can screenshot and be\nthe background of your phone.\nSo every time you\nclick on your phone,\nyou immediately\nsee that quadrant.\nIt's a very clear\nreminder of like,\nwhat are my priorities today?\nJust a simple little picture.\nI also like to put it in\nyour place of failure.\nSo for a lot of people, that is\nlike on their laptop or right\nabove their workstation.\nIt's the thing that's\ngoing to lose and beat\nyour fitness is your job--\ntypically.\nOr it's on your TV, it's\non your Netflix control--\nno, sorry, Netflix, no offense.\nBut you know what I mean?\nIt's whatever the thing\nis that you fail for.\nI play too many video games.\nGreat.\nI work too much.\nOK, great.\nAnd you put it there.\nAnd you put it also--\nthe last component\nis-- it has to also\nbe in the hands of somebody\nwho can hold you accountable.\nWife, training partner,\nbusiness partner, whatever.\nSo it's like, hey,\nAndrew, you promised you\nwere going to do x yourself.\nWhy are you still here?\nYou committed to this.\nYou've got to get out of here.\nSomeone who will\nbe like, no, no.\nIt's drop everything and read.\nIt's 8:00.\nYou're supposed to be reading.\nYou got to go.\nYou're going to check\nback in on that.\nCheck back again every week.\nCheck back in-- it doesn't\nmatter, every month.\nAnd then, you can adjust.\nThat's fine.\nYou can always\nchange the system.\nBut that has to now change.\nYou've got to print a new one.\nAnd now it's a whole new\npromise you've made to yourself.\nSo you've got to be\nable to hold yourself\naccountable to those things.\nIt's got to be flexible enough\nto where it's realistic.\nIt can't be, I'm not going\nto work after 6:00 every day.\nMaybe it's just\nthree days a week.\nMaybe it's, on\nSaturdays I promise\nto work for the first two hours\nso I don't work Saturday night.\nOr whatever, or the inverse,\nI'm not going to work Saturday--\nyou get it.\nYou could come up with\na million examples here.\nSo that's the system\nwe use to make sure\nthat we have now properly\nidentified where we're going.\nWe found a roadmap to that.\nAnd now we know exactly how\nwe're going to stay on track.\nI have to take this opportunity\nto add one more thing\nto our drop everything list.\nAnd you gave the\nexample of DEAR,\nwhich is maybe drop\neverything and read,\nor drop everything and relax.\nOr another example,\nI have to add a DEAL,\nwhich is drop everything\nand-- this is for you, Lex--\nlove.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Actually,\none of the advantages\nof having a dog\nor having children\nis that the drop everything\nand love is often\nenforced by the faces\nof those that you love.\nThey just show up in whatever\nspace you happen to be in.\nANDY GALPIN: Especially\nif you work from home.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'd like to take\na brief break to acknowledge\nour sponsor, Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth and well-being\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nOne issue with a lot of blood\ntests and DNA tests out there,\nhowever, is that you\nget information back\nabout various levels of\nlipids, and hormones,\nand metabolic\nfactors, et cetera.\nBut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes knowing what\nto do with all that information\nexceedingly easy.\nThey have a personalized\nplatform that lets you see what\nyour specific numbers are,\nof course, but then also,\nwhat sorts of behavioral\ndo's and don'ts, what sorts\nof nutritional changes, what\nsorts of supplementation would\nallow you to bring those\nlevels into the ranges that are\noptimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\nInsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's\nInsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off.\nANDY GALPIN: Let's move on\nto the next one, shall we?\nNumber three here is going to\nbe what I call calendar or time\nframe.\nSo it's going back a\nlittle bit and saying,\nyou've decided on\nthis goal and you've\nidentified the defenders.\nNow we need to come up\nwith a realistic time\nframe for how long it's going\nto take to accomplish that goal.\nAnd when you do that, you need\nto look at your life schedule.\nAnd what I mean by\nthat is do you have\nimportant deadlines coming up?\nDo you have a holiday?\nDo you have a trip?\nDo you have travel?\nDo your children have\nsomething coming up?\nYou need to take all\nthat information.\nAnd I literally\nlay out a calendar.\nAnd I write all those dates\nin a physical calendar first.\nAnd the reason I'm\nsuggesting this is you\nwant to work your training\nbackwards around that.\nAs we've been discussing,\nlife will win.\nIf you try to plan a\ntraining program that\nis five days a week 90 minutes\na day, and all of a sudden,\nyou look two weeks from\nnow and you realize\nyou've got a grant deadline.\nAnd then you've got to take\ntwo days to go to Austin.\nIt's just foolish.\nYou're going to fail.\nAnd then you're going to quit.\nAnd you're going to\nbe like, man, again,\nmy training program failed.\nSo you need to\nfigure out what are\nthe non-negotiables are\nin that business quadrant,\nand just not be foolish.\nSo let's imagine you're\ngoing to plot out, say,\na 12-week training phase.\nAnd you want to-- you've\ndecided on this goal.\nAnd then you look\nand you realize\nin the middle of\nthis 12-week span,\nweek five is really\nhectic and chaotic.\nOr you realize that this is\na quarter in which something\nimportant is due.\nMaybe we want to\neither adjust the goal.\nOr what we really do in\nthis step is going on\nto actually step\nnumber four, which\nis choose the number of days\nper week you can exercise\nand the length in\nterms of amount of time\nyou can truly afford to train.\nI would rather you underestimate\nthat than overestimate it.\nSo you, again, you\nlook at the calendar.\nYou put all these\nnon-negotiables,\nthe deadlines you cannot\nmove in the calendar.\nAnd then you say, look,\nbased on this, realistically,\nI can conservatively\ntrain three days a week\nfor 60 minutes total.\nAnd that includes\nthe time I walk\ninto the gym, my warm-up,\nmy down-regulation breathing\nat the end, and\nthen me getting back\neither in the shower and back.\nBecause really, now\nit's maybe 90 minutes\nby the time you traveled,\nyou transitioned,\nyou picked back up on work, you\nshowered, you ate, et cetera.\nThat time just\nruns away from you.\nAnd all of sudden it was\na two and 1/2 hour thing\neven though it was\na 45-minute workout.\nSo you really need to\nfigure that thing out.\nIf you're a few weeks\nin and you realize, ooh,\nI actually have a little\nmore time than I thought,\nyou can always train more.\nYou can do another thing.\nYou can add up.\nBut what you don't\nwant to do is set up\na program that is requiring you\nto do certain exercises on one\ndays or certain styles\nof training on another,\nand then you constantly\nmiss one of those days.\nI thought I could\ndo four days a week,\nbut one day a week something's\ngetting pulled out.\nThat's just going to\nkeep you off schedule.\nIt's going to make you\nfeel like a failure.\nAnd you're going to run into\nproblems with your training.\nSo schedule three if you're\nsure you can get three.\nAnd if there's an extra day, we\ncan always do other fun stuff.\nSo that's really\nstep three and four.\nFigure out your life events\nover the course of this time.\nHow many days a\nweek can you train?\nAnd then how long in terms\nof minutes per workout.\nNotice, we haven't selected\na single exercise yet.\nWe haven't worried\nabout how heavy,\nrest intervals, all those\nmodifiable variables.\nYou don't need to\npick those later.\nFirst, where are we going.\nSecond, how are we going to get\nthere, which is the quadrant\nand identifying of defenders.\nAnd then the third is,\nwhat are the restrictions\nI need to place on myself\nin terms of program design\nbased on how often and\nhow long I can work out.\nThat is going to\nallow you to go back\nto some of the previous\nepisodes and go, man,\nyou gave us all kinds of ideas.\nHow do I know which\none to choose?\nThis is your answer.\nYou're going to choose based\nupon the limitations of time\nand frequency.\nSo if you've already said,\nwe're in-- let's imagine\nwe're in bucket A, or\nbucket C. It doesn't matter.\nAnd you go, look,\nthe most I can afford\nwith where I'm at with\nwhat's going on in my life\nis three days a week.\nWell, we automatically\nknow we're\ngoing to have to start\ntraining-- choosing a training\nstyle that's limited\nto three days a week.\nDon't even worry about the\nfour or five day stuff.\nThose are off the table.\nAnd now we're on-- so\nwe've placed restrictions.\nIt goes back to\nthat concept of I\nthink it's one of your\npodcast's guests, Jocko.\nIt's just like, hey, structure\ngives us actually some freedom.\nSo by creating some\nrestrictions here,\nwe're a little more free\nto go, I only actually\nhave to choose between A and B.\nRather than sitting down and\ngoing, man, there's all--\nI'm 20 hours into this\nexercise podcast thing.\nAnd there's so many options.\nWhich one to pick?\nWell, you create a little\nbit of restriction.\nAnd now it's easier to go,\noh, my only option is A or B.\nAnd there we go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's number four.\nANDY GALPIN: That's\nthree and four.\nAt that point, once\nwe're good there,\nnow what you want to do us\ngo to step number five, which\nis actually select your\nexercises or your movements.\nAnd this can be as simple as\nselecting a kettlebell swing,\nor running, or swimming.\nIt could be your\nentire exercise mode.\nWhat you want to do\nwith exercise selection\nhere is make sure that you're\nbalancing those exercises\nacross the whole week.\nNot within necessarily\nevery workout.\nSo if you have four days\na week, five days a week,\nyou want to look at\nthe exercise selection\nand say, OK, I need\nto have somewhat\nof a reasonable balance between\nmovement patterns, or muscle\ngroups, or front and\nback, side to side,\nhowever you're thinking of\nit, just across that week.\nSo again, say we're on\na three-day program.\nAnd we're in either\nof the buckets--\nany of the buckets, really.\nAnd we say, OK, great.\nMaybe it's not ideal if all I\nselect is cycling every day.\nThat's not a lot of balance.\nI don't notice anything.\nThere's no upper\nbody work there.\nThere's no torso work.\nThere's no other positions.\nSo maybe I'm going to\nreally focus on cycling.\nSo I will do only\ncycling two days a week.\nBut that third day I\nneed to pick something\nfor the other movement areas.\nAnd that's going\nto make sure you\nstay in a reasonable balance.\nIf you have an exercise\nthat you like, great.\nIf you have exercise\nyou have access to.\nAgain, maybe the gym is\na giant pain in the ass.\nAnd so you can say, look.\nThat's too far away.\nThe closest one is 45\nminutes there and back.\nSo maybe I'm going\nto restrict myself\nto only kettlebell, and\nbands, and running, because I\ncan do those in my house.\nAwesome.\nWe've actually\ncreated some freedom\nbecause we gave ourselves\nsome restriction.\nAnd now we just\nhave to figure out\nhow am I going to give some\nmovement patterns somewhat\nbalanced across my three days.\nSo really, when it comes\nto exercise choice,\nit is selecting the patterns\nthat you know how to execute.\nGiving yourself, again,\nsomewhat of a balance\nbetween the muscles, and\nthe joints, and the movement\npatterns.\nMaking sure that\nyou are specifically\ntargeting any muscle group\nor movement that you want.\nSo making sure you\nwant to improve muscle\nsize in your glutes,\nyou better make\nsure some of the exercises\nyou're doing at least one day\na week you're feeling\nin your actual glutes.\nSo you can check that box.\nIt doesn't have to\nbe every exercise.\nIt probably shouldn't.\nIt doesn't even have\nto be every single day.\nBut make sure it's checked\noff somewhere on that list.\nAnd the last one is,\nis there a strategy\nin which you can progress it?\nSo if you're like,\nI'm just going\nto do bodyweight exercises.\nOK, great.\nWell, how are you going\nto progress those?\nIn the case of bodyweight,\nit's really hard to add load.\nMaybe you can put a weight\nvest on or something.\nBut then, maybe you don't have\nthat, or that's an extra thing,\nor that can only go so far.\nSo what's my progression\nstrategy going to be?\nWell, in this case, maybe you\njust increase the complexity\nby going from two legs,\nlike say a bodyweight squat,\nto a single leg squat, or you\njust increase repetitions,\nor you increase time\nyou're going to hold it.\nMy point is, your\nprogression strategy\nwill be based upon\nthe restrictions\nthat you place based\non availability\nand things like that.\nThe last thing I\nalways recommend here\nin terms of exercise\nprogression,\nto make sure that\nyou can continue\nto do these things while\nlowering your risk of injury,\nboth in the short-term\nand long-term,\nis to progress your exercise\ncomplexity in this fashion.\nSo make sure, number one, you\ncan do the exercise properly\nwith assistance.\nSo let's imagine\na scenario where\nwe're going to try to squat.\nSo give yourself-- put your\nhands on a bench or something\nlike that.\nNow, can you execute that squat\nperfectly with assistance?\nSo you're holding\nonto something.\nGreat.\nIf you can't, then don't\nprogress past that.\nDon't go now to a\nbarbell back squat\nif you can't do it correctly\nwhen you have assistance.\nBut let's assume most\npeople can do that.\nOK, great.\nNow you can move on to the\nnext step, which is can you\ndo it well without assistance.\nSo this would be\nbodyweight only.\nCheck, cool.\nWe're good there.\nNow you can go\nahead and move on.\nCan you do it well with\nan added e-centric load?\nSo in this particular case,\nif we're learning a squat,\nwe can do it well when I hold\non to something, that's great.\nNow I can do it well\nwith just my bodyweight.\nNow if I put a\nlittle bit of weight\non, whether it's a kettlebell in\nthe front like a goblet squat,\nor dumbbells to the side,\nor whatever you want to do,\ncan I lower it and\ngo all the way down\nand stay in perfect position?\nIf you can do that, great.\nYou're allowed to go to the\nnext step, which is can you\nhold it isometrically.\nSo can you go all the\nway down and then hold\nthat bottom position?\nWhat you don't want to\ndo is start adding load,\nor speed, or fatigue\nif you're going down\nto the bottom position\nof the movement\nand you are out of control.\nWe really want to avoid this.\nSo I want you to show\nme you can go down\nand you can lower the\nweight under control.\nYou can hold it in that\nposition under control.\nIf we're clear there, now we\ncan add the concentric portion.\nYou can now go ahead,\nyou can lower it,\nyou can hold that\nposition of most danger,\nand now you can move up\nat whatever speed we want.\nWe are all good there.\nOnce you can show\nme those things,\nyou can add the last two\nsteps which are now speed--\nif you choose to--\nand the last one,\nwhich is fatigue.\nI would really discourage\npeople from doing exercises\nto fatigue, especially with\na moderate or high load,\nunless you can promise me you\ncan do these first six steps.\nIf you can, you can basically\ngo hog wild with your training,\nand your chances of\ninjury are very low.\nAgain, both acute injury,\nas well as long-term injury,\nwhich is just sort of\nlike my joints ache,\nand all of a sudden my shoulder\nhurts, and things like that.\nThat's really what\nI'm looking for.\nAnd once you're clear there,\nyou can train pretty hard.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nreally like this.\nBecause, recently, I was\nshowing somebody how to use a--\nin this case, it was\na hack squat machine.\nI notice they were\nvery timid of getting\ninto a deep squat position.\nAnd they cited a\nprevious knee injury,\nwhich has long since healed.\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But even\nwith proper foot placement\nand everything,\nyou just tell, they\nwere getting ginger about\nit as they approached\nthat bottom position.\nBut over time, with\npauses at the bottom,\nthey've become very comfortable.\nAnd now actually are going\nwell below 90 degrees\nangle between femur\nand lower leg.\nANDY GALPIN: Excellent.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So it was clear\nthat it wasn't something range\nof motion limited\nor it was just--\nit was a mental thing, but\na logical one for them.\nNow, after what you\njust said, I think\na better strategy\nthat I could have used\nwould have been to have them\nget into that position, just\nno weight at all, maybe\nnothing on the sled,\nand then slowly\nworking up from there\nas opposed to doing what\nwe did in our case, which\nwas to just convince\nthem that they\nwere much stronger than\nthey thought they were.\nWe eventually got there.\nBut I'm realizing that there\nwas far too much mental anguish\ninvolved in that process.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nThis whole progression,\nby the way,\nthis can all happen\nin one session.\nIf you can check the boxes.\nIn that example, you may\nhave been fine to jump there.\nIt may have just been a,\nhey, you're fine here.\nGet through it.\nOh, OK.\nThis whole progression\nmight take two years.\nI mean, this really\ndepends on your background,\nif you actually have injury\nhistory, your comfort,\nyour confidence,\nall these things.\nSo you don't need to\nworry about rushing\nthrough that progression.\nYou don't even need to\nget all the way to the end\nif you don't want, especially\nwith speed and things\nlike that.\nBut again, it can happen.\nIt doesn't have\nto be like, well,\nit's a month of this, a month--\nwell, no.\nIf they feel great\nand you can go\nthrough one to seven\nin five minutes,\nthen you're good to go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Number six.\nANDY GALPIN: Number\nsix now is just order.\nSo you know how many days per\nweek you're going to work out.\nYou know how long\nthey're going to take.\nYou've selected all the\nexercises you need to get done.\nYou've balanced that\nacross the week.\nNow you just need to\nput them in order.\nAnd the easy answer\nhere is generally\ndo what's most important\nfirst in the workout.\nThere is some minor interference\neffect of some other things\nthere.\nBut the reality of it is, if\nyou do the priority first,\nyou're probably going to be OK.\nSo whether this priority\nis a muscle group.\nSo in the example,\nyou want to make\nsure your glutes get trained.\nMaybe do it first.\nIf you're trying to\nmaximize your back squat,\nyou may not want to do a\nbunch of glute exercises\nto fatigue first.\nBut that's not the\npriority we picked.\nWe picked a different\none, which is\nbuckets A, B, and C. OK, great.\nBy doing it first, you\ntold me the priority\nwas to make sure I do\nsomething for my glutes.\nAnd then I would also like to\nget my back squat a little bit\nstronger or whatever.\nFine.\nThe same thing could be done\nfor your endurance training.\nYou could do your endurance\ntraining before your lifting\nif you understand\nthat that means\nyou might be compromising\nyour lifting quality\nof the workout a little bit.\nBut you might be\nfine with that if you\nsay the endurance work is\nmore important right now.\nAmazing.\nYou don't know\nthe answer to that\nthough if you hadn't gone\nthrough steps one through four.\nAnd that's why those\nthings are critical.\nSo it makes what we call\nchaos management, which\nis things happen in the moment.\nI don't know what to do.\nWhat should I choose?\nThat decision\nbecomes really clear\nbecause you can always go back\nto the beginning of my priority\nwas this.\nThen therefore, that's\nmy choice today.\nSo it provides a very\nsimple set of instructions\nfor when the workout\ngets cut short,\nwhen your workout\nhas to be in a hotel,\nand any number of things\nthat pop up in real life,\nwhether, again, you're an\nathlete or non-athlete.\nEither way, life will get\nin the way at some point.\nSo you need to have rules\nand a system that says,\nwhen this happens, I\ngo right back to this.\nAnd that's my choice.\nDone.\nI'm moving on.\nNo decision to make here.\nIt's already been determined\na week ago, five weeks ago.\nWe're often rolling.\nSo the order, again,\nis pretty simple.\nJust put the one that\nis most important first.\nNow, I know you like\nto do legs on Monday.\nThat's great.\nI actually love that too.\nI do the same thing\ngenerally, because\nto me, that's almost always\nthe most important thing.\nIf I miss a bicep workout,\nI'm probably fine.\nBut I really don't like missing\nthe big movement pattern.\nSo I make sure that those\nhappen on a day that\ntend to be more stable for me.\nMondays are generally\npretty stable.\nThings get chaotic as the\nweek moves along for me.\nOthers might be the opposite.\nOthers might want to\ngo, hey, I'm actually\ngoing to keep Monday as\nmy flexible day or off day\nbecause I like to get\na lot of my work done,\nget that cleared so I\ncan have-- oh, sure.\nWork it around you.\nSome people love to\ntrain on Saturdays\nbecause it's their most\nfree, some people hate it.\nSure.\nYou tell me, what is\nthe biggest priority,\nand what are you the most fresh?\nMonday, Tuesday,\nit doesn't matter.\nIt depends on your\nwork schedule.\nMaybe you work the weekends.\nI don't know.\nYou decide what\nday of the week are\nyou generally the\nmost consistent,\nthe most consistent schedule,\nand the most consistent energy.\nAnd do the thing that is\nmost important on that day.\nIt doesn't matter Monday,\nTuesday, day one, day three.\nWe were sort of talking\nabout this earlier.\nBut you actually don't even\nhave to do a week schedule.\nOur brains tend to like\nto go year, month, week.\nBut a lot of folks\nwill even just\nrun this thing in terms of a\nseven or nine-day schedule.\nIn fact, we ran a\nnine-day training schedule\nfor one of my Major\nLeague Baseball players.\nAnd he's eight or so\nyears into his career.\nAnd he's hitting\nall-time PRs in velocity.\nAnd he's very, very good.\nAnd it was a nine-day\ntraining cycle.\nAnd we ran that for\nthe entire season.\nSo it doesn't have to\nbe a seven-day split.\nBut it tends to work\nfor a lot of people\nbecause most people have a\nfairly consistent schedule\nacross the seven days.\nSo pick the thing\nthat is most important\nand do it first,\nand do it on the day\nof the week that is\nmost consistent for you\nin terms of schedule and energy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I really\nlike what you're describing.\nI should just say that one\nof the reasons I put legs\non Monday is because\nI tend to get\nenough sleep on the weekends.\nI generally get enough sleep\nduring the middle of the week.\nBut oftentimes,\nthings will come up.\nI can be pretty sure, however,\nthat I've, quote unquote,\ncaught up on my sleep\non the weekends.\nThis notion of\ncatching up on sleep\nis a little dicey\nscientifically.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I tend\nto be pretty rested by Monday\nmorning.\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And actually,\nmy week begins on Sunday.\nAnd Sundays are when I\nget my long form cardio.\nANDY GALPIN: There you go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So those two\nare really non-negotiable.\nAnd the reason that long\nform cardio is on Sunday\nis that it can take\nmany different forms.\nIt can take a hike\nwith a weighted vest.\nIt can take the form of a jog.\nIt can be done\nwith other people.\nIt can be family time.\nIt can be time with\nfriends and so on.\nAnd that's pretty hard to do\nduring the middle of the week\nor pretty hard to\nensure, at least for me.\nI also find that by\nbookending the week\nwith some non-negotiable days\nof training on Sunday, Monday,\nthen if the week\ngets busy Tuesday,\nWednesday or even sometimes\nThursday with travel\nand things like that, one can\ncatch up toward the weekend.\nIt's not ideal.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,\nideally, it's spaced out.\nBut really, this\nisn't about what I do.\nThis is really\njust to underscore\nthe principle you\ndescribed, which\nis, I have a very clear\nsense now over three decades\nor so of training and\nthree decades or so\nof being involved in academics,\nand science, and work, of when\nI tend to be most\nrested, when I tend\nto have some flexibility\nin my schedule.\nAnd also, when I'm\ntrying to combine fitness\nwith some of my\nsocial engagements,\nwhich is actually quite fun.\nOne thing I note is\nthat the four boxes\nthat you mentioned before,\nwork, relationships, fitness,\nand recovery.\nSome of them do\nhave some crossover.\nANDY GALPIN: They all do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A hike\nwith family or friends\nis both relationship\nand fitness, and so on.\nBut I love the principle.\nBecause anything that\ncan add consistency,\nas you pointed it out, is\ngoing to greatly increase\nthe probability of\nreaching one's goals.\nThat's sort of an obvious one.\nBut in an earlier episode\nyou also said something\nthat I wrote down\nand is really still\nringing in my mind, especially\nnow, which is that consistency\nalways beats intensity.\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nYeah, absolutely.\nWe used to do a thing--\nwhen I was training NFL players\nfor the combine many years\nago--\nwhere Saturdays were supposed\nto be the day they came in\nand we did the\nmost regeneration.\nSo this is when they\nget body work done.\nAnd we do hot cold contrast\nand sort of all these things.\nAnd our attendance was like 1%.\nNobody showed up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: For a massage?\nANDY GALPIN: Nobody showed up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nI'm surprised.\nANDY GALPIN: Seems right.\nBut remember--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nlove a good massage.\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nBut remember,\nyou're 18 years old.\nYou're likely to\nbe getting millions\nof dollars handed to you in\nthe next few weeks or months.\nAnd--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's not\nreferring to me, by the way.\nANDY GALPIN: No, no.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm actually\nquite a bit older than 18.\n[LAUGHS] And I'm not getting\nhanded millions of dollars\neach week.\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nSo I would think that.\nBut those folks, they\nrecover super fast.\nThey've never really had that.\nAnd also, Friday night,\nkind of enticing.\nAnd so, nothing was there.\nAnd the strategy then\nwas, what if we instead\nof having a important hard\ntraining day on Saturday\nwe transition and it is\nonly things they want to do.\nSo we basically\nidentified, what are\nthe things in training\nyou love the most,\nand let's do those Saturdays.\nAnd it turns out for those\nfolks, no surprise here,\nit was what we\ncall the gun show.\nSo they would come into the gym.\nAnd we would literally do\nnothing but biceps and triceps.\nThey'd just get a pump.\nAnd then the deal was\nthough, you come in--\nand literally, it would come in\nis, we would pick three guys.\nSay you, you, and you.\nYou pick your favorite\nbicep exercise.\nYou pick your favorite one.\nYou pick your favorite one.\nYou three over there, you\npick your favorite tricep,\ntricep, tricep.\nAnd we just run a big circuit.\nLike this is, how many reps?\nI don't know.\nI don't care.\nHow many sets?\nI don't even care.\nJust pump away.\nI don't even care.\nWe chose small muscle groups.\nNot really going to\ninterfere with much.\nWe're training them for\nthe NFL combine, which is--\nit's not a-- it's a legs\nperformance, basically.\nSo it's like, if they smash\ntheir biceps and triceps\non a Saturday, it's\nnot going to influence\nwhat we did on Monday.\nSo recovery wasn't an issue.\nOnce we finish the\ngun show though,\nnow you have to go\ndo your regen stuff.\nSo if you need chiro work,\nyou need physical therapy,\nwhatever you're going to do.\nSo we would get\nthem in the building\nwith the low-hanging fruit.\nAnd then we would actually\nget them to do their work.\nYou can do the same thing.\nAnd I honestly do\nthe same thing.\nI tend to do either--\nif I'm going to do an\nupper or lower split,\nI'm going to do that\nstuff either Friday\nnight or Saturday.\nBecause it's very\ndifficult for me\nto do a hard long workout\nFriday night or even Friday\nmorning for that matter.\nThe same thing Saturday.\nI wake up.\nAnd now it's like,\nit's family mode.\nIt's kid things.\nI want to do stuff.\nI want-- man.\nBut I can usually convince\nmyself to be like, all right,\njust go in there\nand go 20 minutes\nand get your upper\nbody stuff done.\nAll right.\nI can walk myself\ninto that mentally.\nIt's harder to walk\nyourself into your five\nsets of five Deadlift.\nIt's sort of just like, whoa, I\nain't got that in me right now.\nMy high intensity\nintervals, the max stuff,\nI don't have that right now.\nSo I'll either go for my long\nsteady state stuff, which\nis like, I'm going on the bike.\nI'm riding down to the beach,\nor coming back, nasal only,\nI can get myself to go\nfor a bike ride, whatever.\nSo I picked the thing that\nI'm likely to do on the days\nwhere I'm probably going to\nbe my weakest, quote unquote.\nNot physically, but\nmotivation-wise.\nFor a long time I try to--\nit just got stuck in a way\nwhere my harder stuff\nwas Friday nights.\nAnd I'm just like,\nwhy am I doing this?\nI was having like\na 50% success rate.\nJust like we were having\na no percent success rate\nwith the NFL guys on Saturday.\nSo you have to be\na little bit tough.\nYou have to grind sometimes.\nYou have to get some\nmotivation and go after it.\nBut you also have\nto be like, well,\nthis is just stupid planning.\nWhy put yourself\nin a position where\nyou're just failing\nover, and over,\nand over, when I could\nmove it and go, look,\nthose sessions are going to\nbe things that are easier.\nThey don't require as much gusto\nto get up and get them done.\nI get those things\ndone 90% of the time.\nBecause the worst case I\ncan be like, all right,\nwe're going to go\ndo a family thing.\nGive me 20 minutes.\nI'm just going to run up\nthere and smash upper body.\nAnd you don't need--\nI need a 20 minute warm-up.\n[LAUGHS] It's like, I can\njust jump into those things\nif I had to.\nIf I feel great, then I can\nstill go do something else,\nor I could do more, I\ncould do a longer session.\nBut you're sort of\nimmune to any situation.\nSo I would book-end those,\nI guess, is what I'm saying.\nWhat's the day you're going to\nhave the best day, and what's\nthe day you generally\nhave the worst?\nAnd put the programs\naround those situations.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI love the idea of\nidentifying the friction\npoints, the high friction\nand low friction days.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nFriction meaning anything\nthat impedes you from\ntraining consistently or well.\nAnd there are so many factors\nthat ratchet into that-- sleep,\nother social engagements, work.\nFriday night, I also\nfind it tough to do\nany kind of training.\nI do cardiovascular training.\nI do interval type training\non Fridays typically.\nBut there's a lot of\ncumulative fatigue and stress\nthat happens across the week.\nANDY GALPIN: Right on.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nusually, for a long time,\ngosh, more than a\ndecade now, I've\nbeen telling myself\nthat Saturday\nis the day that I try to\nreduce my cortisol as much as\npossible from the week.\nANDY GALPIN: There you go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And then\nSunday is the day that I\nenjoy that low cortisol state.\nAnd that's actually what opened\nup into the long, slow run.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nactually like to think\nof myself as a bit of a\nmule during those long runs.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I actually have\na shirt that has a sloth on it\nthat I wear to remind myself\nto go slowly on those runs.\nNot that I ever run that fast.\nBut there's the\nwhole mindset around\nit is to be a bit of a mule,\njust kind of moving through it.\nAnd the fatigue\nfactor is more one\nof at first there's just\na little bit of boredom.\nBut then, I've noticed,\nthere's a whole different set\nof mental scapes that open up\nunder different training types.\nAnd this is maybe\nsomething we get\ninto a little bit in a\nfuture episode or discussion.\nWhen you train really intensely\nfor short periods of time one\nway, your mind goes\ninto a particular state.\nWhen you do long\nduration training,\nyou're thinking and\nindeed even the way\nit affects sleep patterns\nis also very different.\nI think one of the great futures\nfor neuroscience and exercise\nscience in collaboration\nis to identify\nhow different patterns\nof physical movement\nrelate to different patterns\nof thinking and vice versa.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Anyway,\nsomething maybe to just earmark\nfor a future conversation.\nBut there's clearly\na relationship there.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nWell, when we certainly know\nof a pretty clear relationship\nbetween even what we would\nclassify as zone five exercise\nand deep sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So a zone\nfive again being you're\nbreathing a lot\nthrough your mouth\nbecause you have to in order\nto bring in enough oxygen\nto offset the\nacidity created by--\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDY GALPIN: The carbon.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nThis is the high heart rate.\nSo I mean, if you're\ngoing to look at it\nand hit a number, looking for\nsomething like 30-plus minutes\na week being in the top\n10% of your heart rate.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That\nimpacts deep sleep.\nANDY GALPIN: Is going\nto positively impact\ndeep sleep, as long as it's done\nvery far away from deep sleep.\nSo you don't want\nto do that at night.\nSo you want-- in terms of time.\nSo if you hit those\nnumbers earlier in the day,\noftentimes that will\nenhance deep sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I\nwas looking at some papers\nrecently.\nAnd the number that\nemerged from those papers\nwas that unless it's\nlow intensity exercise,\ntrying to exercise about\nsix hours or more away\nfrom your sleep\ntime would be ideal.\nANDY GALPIN: Bingo.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, that\nsaid, for those of you that\nhave to hit the gym or go\nfor a run in the evening\nand then are trying to fall\nasleep four to six hours later,\nI wouldn't want that\nstatement to impede\nyour regular exercising.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nthere's an easy trick to that.\nJust finish it with\ndown-regulation breathing.\nSo that's one of our things,\nthat if you-- because that\nis a realistic situation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nFinish work at 5:00, or even\n6:00, and then by the time\nyou're training or running or\nwhatever you want to call it,\nit's a 7:30, 8:00,\nyou're home at 9:00.\nYou're eating, and\nthen everyone's\nlike, you can't eat\ntwo hours before bed.\nPretty soon you run into a\nnumber of different collision\npoints that make you\nwonder whether or not\nyou're doing everything\nwrong or if it's\nreally worth training at all.\nANDY GALPIN: 100%.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, I\nwould argue it's better\nto train than not to train.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nprovided that you can still\nget to sleep.\nANDY GALPIN: 100%.\nSo you have to walk a\nlittle bit of a game.\nWe run into this issue\nwith the NBA players.\nYou're playing games at\n6:00 at night that start.\nMajor League Baseball is\na 7:05, 7:10 pitch, right?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right.\nANDY GALPIN: And\nalso, by the way,\nwe're changing time\nzones every five days.\nUFC fighters and such, were\nusually training twice a day.\nThere is no option\nto train, or I mean,\nwe are training\ntwice a day always.\nSo we have to come up\nwith strategies for that.\nAnd there's other\nnon-athlete scenarios,\nof course, where it's like,\nthere is no other option here.\nCool.\nSo what we do is a\ncouple of things.\nNumber one, the further\naway you can make it\nfrom sleep, the\nbetter if possible.\nWe do need to train, though,\naround the same time you're\ngoing to be playing.\nThat has to happen.\nSo the harder and longer\nwe go in the training\nsession, the harder\nand longer we\ngo in our down-regulation\npost-exercise.\nAnd that is, in my estimation,\nthe number one lever\nyou can pull that can help.\nNow, if it really does\nstart crushing sleep,\nyou're going to have to make\na critical decision there.\nIn general, it's not a good\nreason to not exercise.\nBut maybe you restrict to\nonly a couple of days a week\nyou go all the way\nup in intensity.\nAnd the rest of\nthe days maybe 70%,\nyou stay in this kind\nof a working zone.\nAwesome.\nMaybe it's a longer\ndown-regulation.\nMaybe there's other\nstrategies you can do.\nBut yeah.\nYou want to be\ncareful of-- and we've\nhad this situation a number\nof times where it's just\nsleep complaints, sleep\ncomplaints, sleep complaints.\nWe run full sleep studies\non them in their house.\nWe do the whole thing\nwith absolute rest.\nWe come in.\nWe do the whole\nthing eye tracking,\nbiomarkers, the whole thing.\nAnd it's like, oh,\nyou just need to stop\ndoing intervals at 8:00 PM.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I would add to\nthat, another\nincentive for being\nable to train with\nor without caffeine\nis that it's very clear that\neven if you can fall asleep\nafter ingesting caffeine\nin the preceding hours that\ncaffeine consumed in the,\ngosh, even 12 but really eight\nto 10 hours, four hours\nprior to bedtime really\ndisrupts the\narchitecture of sleep.\nSo if you critically rely on\ncaffeine in order to train,\nwhatever your training\nmight be, and you\nknow that sleep is\nimportant for recovery,\nwell, then it's pretty obvious\nwhere I'm going with this.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So having\nthat flexibility is vitally\nimportant.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nYou've probably\nalso covered this.\nBut you can actually\nmeasure that directly.\nSo by eye tracking\npatterns, you can actually\nidentify the effects\nthat caffeine\nhas on sleep independent\nof sleep time or not.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nThere are never\npositive effects.\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That said,\nI am a proponent of caffeine\nearly in the day.\nAnd caffeine does\nhave a lot of--\nwell, it's\nanti-neurodegenerative.\nAs long as you're\nnot getting anxiety,\nit's pro-performance,\nboth mental and physical\nperformance.\nBut, of course, if you\ndo not need caffeine,\nif you're one of these mutants\nthat do not need caffeine\nin order to go about\nyour daily living\nwith focus and intensity,\nthen, by all means,\ndon't start taking caffeine.\nANDY GALPIN: I'm\nnot the hugest fan.\nI am scientifically.\n100% or more.\nPersonally, it does--\nI don't do well on it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, you seem\nto ride a little bit more what\nwe would call a\nsympathetic tone, shifted\ntowards more alert.\nI tend to be\nnaturally a bit more\nlike my bulldog Costello\nwas, a little bit more\non the mellow sleepy side.\nAnd caffeine just puts me right\nat that alert but calm place.\nAnd I can get away\nwith drinking it--\nI wouldn't say a ridiculous,\nbut a fair amount of caffeine\nand remain there.\nBut I do restrict it until the\ntime right up about 2:00 PM\nat the latest is really when I\nwere trying to drink caffeine.\nNumber seven.\nANDY GALPIN: Great.\nSo number seven and\neight are pretty simple.\nThis is now choose the\nintensity and the volume.\nSo we've discussed\nthose at length\nin the previous episodes.\nWe probably don't have\nthe time to go back\nover all those details.\nSo remember the adaptation\nyou're training for\nand pick the appropriate rep\nrange, total amount of sets,\nas well as the\nintensity to then get\nthe corresponding adaptation.\nAll you have to do is\nselect those things.\nIn terms of progression\nthrough a week,\nthe rule of thumb\nwe say for intensity\nis something around\nthree 3% per week.\nFor volume, it will depend on\nwhat you're doing a little bit,\nbut any time you cross\nmore than 10% per week,\nyou're going to start\nrunning into problems.\nSo I like 5% better.\nIt doesn't need to\nbe as low as three.\nYou can jump up\nmuch more than that.\n5% to 7% is better.\nSo if you are\ndoing, say, running,\nbecause the numbers\nmake it easy,\nand you're doing 10\nmiles per week total.\nAnd if you were to go up to\n11 miles the next week, great.\nYou're right around 10%.\nBut what you wouldn't\nwant to do is say,\nI'm running 10 miles this week.\nAnd I did maybe four Monday,\nthree Wednesday, three Friday.\nSo four, three, and\nthree, you got your 10.\nThen you wouldn't want\nto add a mile every day.\nSo Monday, instead of\ndoing four, I did five.\nWednesday instead of\ndoing three I did four.\nFriday instead of\ndoing three I did four.\nWhat you actually did is\nyou went from 10 to 13,\nwhich is a much higher jump\nthan the 10% prescribed.\nSo the same thing would be\ntrue for lifting weights.\nThe same thing is actually\ntrue for calories and trying\nto add them, et cetera.\nSo the body tends to\nnot handle those things\nas well jumping more\nthan 10% per week.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So keeping\nwith this idea of increasing\nprogressive overload, being 10%\nmore over some period of time,\nam I correct in assuming that\nI want to identify one, maybe\ntwo meaningful variables\nand progressing\nthat or those variables?\nANDY GALPIN: So\nprogressive overload\ncan come in the form of any\nof the modifiable variables.\nSo you could increase the\ncomplexity of the movement.\nYou could increase the\nintensity or the load.\nYou can increase the volume by\neither more sets, more reps,\nor more total\nexercises in a day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout time under tension?\nANDY GALPIN: You can\nalso manipulate how--\nthe tempo of each repetition.\nYou can also manipulate how\nmany times per day you train.\nSo you can manipulate frequency.\nYou can also manipulate\nrest intervals.\nSo you can progressively\nload any of these things.\nIncrease intensity.\nRun a little bit faster.\nComplete the same amount\nof work slightly faster.\nPut 5% more on the barbell,\nor the load, or the handle,\nor whatever you going to do.\nThat's the simple way.\nIf you want to think\nabout volume, in the case\nof endurance work is simple--\nmileage, time, whatever.\nIn the case of lifting,\nall you have to do\nis take the amount\nof repetitions\nyou're doing per set,\nmultiply it by the sets,\nadd that all up.\nSo if you're doing three sets\nof 10, that's 30 repetitions.\nIf you did three exercises,\nyou just did 90 repetitions.\nPut that number down for Monday.\nPut that number\ndown for Wednesday.\nPut that number down for Friday.\nAdd that total up.\nSo say you did 90, 90, 90.\nYou would look and say, my total\nnumber of repetitions this week\nis 270.\nIf I want to go\nup 5%, then I need\nto go up another 15 or\nso total repetitions.\nGreat that's all we have to do.\nThat's the increase.\nYou may keep the load exactly\nthe same, keep the exercises\nthe same, change nothing else.\nBut you want to add 15 more\ntotal reps for your week.\nAnd you may choose\nto do that by adding\none more repetition per set.\nClose enough.\nSo last week I did\nthree sets of 10.\nThis week I'm going\nto three sets of 11.\nIt can be as simple as that.\nAgain, it can be complex.\nI walked you through--\nit can be any\nof the modifiable variables.\nBut the progression I just\nlaid out is fairly simple,\nand it's honestly the one I\nrecommend for most people,\njust because it\nwill avoid confusion\nand it will avoid people\ntaking massive leaps in volume.\nSo the typical strategy\nI would recommend here\nis increasing load or\nintensity, or a little bit\nof a combination, slowly\nfor about six or so weeks\nand then taking what we\ngenerally call a de-load.\nSo back down to maybe 70%.\nWhatever that number\nis you've been doing.\nSo you did three sets of\n10 and you worked yourself\nall the way up to\nthree sets of 15.\nBack that down and maybe\nwe'll do two sets of eight\nfor the week.\nAnd then we'll come\nback the following week\nand go back and do the\nhighest we've done.\nNow we're all of a sudden we're\ngoing to do four sets of 12\nor something like that.\nSo if you get these\nlittle de-loads every--\ndepending on what you're\ndoing, four weeks or so--\nyou should be in a spot\nwhere you can continually\nprogress for a very long\ntime without either burning\nout or overloading,\nand over-stressing,\nand injury pattern.\nSo the simple way, pick\nintensity or volume.\nAnd just go up slightly every\nweek for a short span of time,\ngenerally around six weeks.\nAnd then you come back\nand change your strategy\nif you'd like.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because you\nmentioned sets and repetitions\nhere, I just wanted\nto remind folks\nthat in the episode that we did\non strength and hypertrophy--\nand that also included speed--\nthere was a description of a\nterrific program for strength,\nwhich is the three\nby five program,\nor three to five\nprogram, as it's called,\nwhich is to select three\nto five exercises performed\nfor three to five repetitions\nthree to five times\nper week with three\nto five minutes rest\nin between those exercises.\nANDY GALPIN: For\nthree to five sets.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nif I recall correctly,\nthe protocol for generating\nhypertrophy, muscle growth,\nis to perform a minimum of 10\nand probably more like 15 to 20\nsets per muscle group per week.\nAnd that can be done in a single\nsession per muscle per week.\nSo one could train,\nfor instance,\nquadriceps one day\nper week, as long\nas you're getting that\nvolume of sets per week.\nOr it could be divided up across\ntwo or three different sessions\nfor that individual\nmuscle group.\nOf course, people are going to\ntarget all their major muscle\ngroups and hopefully some of\nthe minor muscle groups as well.\nAnd as I recall, the\nnumber of repetitions\nthat can generate\nhypertrophy is quite broad,\nanywhere from six\nrepetitions all the way up\nto 30 repetitions.\nBut by the end of the set,\nit should be to failure\nor close to failure\nwith good form.\nIs that correct?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nAnd we would say,\nclose to failure\nis probably most appropriate.\nYou can actually\nreach failure maybe\non a few of the\nsets, maybe the end.\nAnd probably best to choose\nthat with the exercises that\nare safer, not that any exercise\nis particularly unsafe if you\ndo it appropriately.\nBut you may not want\nto go to true failure\non every set for the\nmore complex, larger,\nriskier exercises.\nSo hedge pretty close to\nfailure, but not all the way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I realized I\nforgot to mention rest\nintervals between sets.\nIt follows that if a\nlarge range of repetitions\nare performed that a large range\nof rest intervals are allowed,\nmeaning that there could be\nrest intervals between sets\nof as low as 30\nseconds between sets\nor as high of two or three\nminutes, depending on the loads\nthat one is using.\nAnd that, of course, will scale\nwith the number of repetitions.\nANDY GALPIN: Excellent.\nIn fact, that leads\nme into step number\nnine of designing your own\ntraining program, which\nis you've decided on a goal.\nWe've worked our calendar out.\nWe've figured out how\nmany days per week\nand how long we're going to\nwork out in those sessions.\nWe then went and\nselected our exercises.\nWe balance them across\nthe movement patterns\nand the muscle\ngroups that we need\nso we're not causing excessive\nstress on the same exact joint\nor muscle group over time.\nWe then ordered our\nexercises based on priority.\nBecause of that, we've\nidentified our goal.\nWe went back and we\nselected the volume,\nwhich is the repetitions per\nset, the total amount of sets,\nand the load per set that\nmatched the goal that we wanted\nto get or the adaptation.\nNow, all we have to do is fill\nin the rest intervals, which\nreflect back, again, the goal.\nSo generally higher rest\nintervals, which means\ntime that you rest\nbetween your sets.\nHigher somewhere between two\nto five minutes for things\nlike speed, power, and strength.\nPerhaps a little bit lower,\nalthough as you mentioned,\nit could also stay\nhigh for hypertrophy.\nAnd then for endurance, you\nfollow the rest interval\nthat reflects the type\nof endurance training\nthat you'd like to get.\nThat's walked us through\none through nine.\nWe're almost done.\nWe've put together a pretty\nnice little protocol.\nIt should be well rounded.\nIt should be effective.\nWe've also talked about how to\nprogress it from week to week,\nkeeping it within, again, four\nto six weeks, maybe up to eight\nbefore we then take a back-off.\nThe very last\nthing we have to do\nto make sure this training\nprogram is customized to you,\nyour goal, and your situation,\nwhich is then going to enhance\nyour likelihood of\nadherence and consistency,\nas well as increase the\nlikelihood of effectiveness\nis, we just have to do\na little bit of what\nwe call chaos management.\nWhich is take a quick\nmoment to think through,\nthis program looks great.\nBut if I had to\nnitpick it, where\nare the possible\nchances of failure?\nAnd you just want to\nthink about where would I\npredict things would go wrong?\nAnd if anything pops out to you.\nTry to come up with your\nsolution at the beginning.\nAnd this could be\na number of things.\nSo maybe you've\npicked an exercise\nand you realize, man,\nI really actually\ndon't like that exercise.\nOr maybe you look\nat the schedule\nnow that it's laid\nout in front of you.\nYou look at your work schedule.\nAnd you're like, ah, maybe\nthat's a bit aggressive.\nI don't know.\nIt could be any\nnumber of things.\nBut it is a useful exercise to\njust think through everything\nrealistically.\nI typically just-- it's the\nadage I teach my graduate\nstudents--\nbefore we hit Submit,\nwe're going to sleep.\nSo it's there.\nIt's ready.\nWe're going to take 12 hours.\nWe're going to wake\nup the next day\nand look at it again and go,\nare we sure we're good here?\nYep.\nMake adjustments if you need.\nIf not, if you feel\nconfident, then\nhit send and cross your fingers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWe were referring to\nsubmitting the manuscript.\nIt's interesting you say that.\nI have a statement that I\nalways make to people in my lab.\nThey hit Submit,\nand they always say\nthat you realize you're going\nto wake up tomorrow morning.\nThere's going to be\nan email in your inbox\nthat something was\nformatted incorrectly\nand you're going to spend\ntomorrow reformatting\nand submitting again.\nSo I've also learned that\nevery project is actually\ntwo projects--\nANDY GALPIN: I'm sorry.\nI'm trying to not die over\nhere and interrupt you.\n[LAUGHS] It's true.\nYou have no--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nIt's true.\nI've done this enough times.\nI've done this many\ndozens of times.\nAnd then there's also\nanother truism of science\nwhich is that\nthere's the project,\nthere's the scientific question.\nAnd then the paper is\nyet another project.\nAnd I actually think this is\nan analogy that carries over\nto other domains of life.\nI think that any time\nwe take on something,\nif we want to write a book,\nor we want to get a degree,\nor we want to do\na fitness program,\nI think it's worth thinking\nabout those decisions\nas actually to taking\non two major things.\nBecause one is the planning and\norganization around that thing.\nAnd the other is the actual\nperformance of the thing.\nANDY GALPIN: Wonderful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And so, I\nsay that, because here what\nyou just described, this 10\nsteps to consider in designing\na program, I think some people\nwho are real list makers\nand love the precision\nand the thoroughness--\nand I'm one of these people--\nthinking, this is great.\nI just want to check off each\none of these things on the list\nand figure out the\nideal program for me\nfor a given period\nof time et cetera.\nAnd then other folks might be\nthinking, well, that's a lot.\nThat's just a lot to do.\nBut what I know\nwith certainty is\nthat performing those sorts\nof, let's just call them\nwhat they are, those\ntasks of figuring out\nwhat's what, where\nthe defenders are,\net cetera, without question\nmakes everything go so much\nmore smoothly once you are\ninto the actual performance,\nthe action of doing the\nexercise program, or the book,\nor the podcast, or whatever\nit is that you happen to do.\nSo I'm grateful that you\nbrought up both the things that\nact as conduits for getting\ngood work done and this notion\nof defenders and bottlenecks.\nBecause we don't\nconsider those, I\nwould argue that it's\na very low probability\nthat anyone will succeed.\nBut when one does consider\nthose, even just a few of them,\nI think the probability\nof success goes way,\nway up immediately.\nANDY GALPIN: That's\nactually a very good point.\nThat is a lot of work\nfor a lot of people.\nAnd I know when I'm\nconsuming information,\nit is helpful to hear structure,\nand systems, and design.\nIt's also helpful to hear\nactual real-life examples.\nSo maybe the next\nthing we can do here\nis I can just walk you\nthrough an entire setup\nand a program considering folks\nthat are in bucket A, B, and C.\nAnd maybe I'll save a little\nbit of the explanation.\nAnd we'll eliminate\nmaybe some background.\nAnd I'll just walk you through\nwhat this could look like.\nAll right.\nSo I created a program which\nshould run about a year.\nAnd the idea here is that this\ncould be an evergreen system.\nSo one could check off all the\nboxes that we've talked about.\nSo in general we want to\nhave three primary goals\nwith exercise.\nWe want to look a certain way,\nwhatever that means to you.\nWe want to be able to perform\na certain way, whether that's\nfor life goals, like hiking\nand energy, or sport goals,\nor whatever.\nAnd then we want to be able to\ndo that across our lifespan.\nSo a program that gives you\nall the goals we talked about,\nand a program that covers that\nhealth combine that we referred\nto way back in some of\nour earlier discussions,\nwhich as a little\nbit of a recap is,\nwhat are the physical\nfitness parameters that we\nknow are critical to maintaining\nboth lifespan and wellness\nspan?\nAnd as a bit of\na reminder, those\nare things like your grip\nstrength, your leg strength,\nyour total amount\nof muscle mass,\nyour actual speed and power\nso that you can catch yourself\nfrom a fall, your VO2 max,\nand your physical fitness.\nSo I want a program that does\na little bit of all that.\nIt's similar,\nactually, and we're\nkind of crossing barriers\nbetween our three buckets.\nSo I need to be able\nto control my fat.\nI need to be able to\nhave enough muscle.\nThat muscle needs to\nhave enough function.\nAnd I need to be able to\nmaintain range of motion\nso that I don't lose\nflexibility and get hurt.\nAnd then I need to\nhave a good VO2 max\nas well as to be able to\nsustain energy over time.\nSo that was the\ngoal of my progress.\nNow, a couple of other things\nthat we haven't chatted about,\nwhich are very important.\nYou have mentioned, I\nthink, on a previous podcast\nabout the importance\nof seeing light?\nIs this something you've\ncovered at one point or another?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI joked that I'll be\ngoing into the grave\nand they'll be\nshoveling dirt onto me\nand I'll be telling people\nwhat I'll tell you again now,\nwhich is to get five to 30\nminutes of sunlight viewing\nas early in the day as\npossible, ideally from sunlight.\nBut that's why it's\ncalled sunlight.\nOr from bright lights of\nanother kind if you cannot get\nsunlight.\nAnd also get that\nin the evening.\nAnd then avoid bright lights\nbetween the hours of 10:00\nPM and 4:00 AM, unless you\ndo shift work, in which case,\ncheck out our episode\non shift work.\nANDY GALPIN: [LAUGHS] Amazing.\nSo we've got a little\nbit of a juxtaposition\nwhere people are like, I\nneed to work out and do\nall this training.\nBut then I'm also\nsupposed to be outside.\nHow do I blend those two things\ninto my training program?\nCool.\nSo I checked that box as well.\nI built that in.\nThe last thing here\nis we've talked\nabout structured exercise.\nAnd just in this episode,\nwe've really opened up\nand do non-structured\nexercise-- hiking, sports,\nthings like that.\nWell, one thing that\nis incredibly clear--\nand my colleague and\nfriend, Tommy Wood,\nat the University of Washington,\npublished a fantastic paper\nvery recently on the\nimportance of proprioception\nin maintaining and staving\noff late onset dementia\nand Parkinson's.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMaybe just to remind\npeople what proprioception is.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.\nSo there's structured exercise.\nAnd that's very important.\nBut then there's also things\nlike balance, and coordination.\nAnd proprioception\nmeaning you're\nadjusting to stimuli coming\nin from the outside world.\nSo this stimuli could be sound.\nIt could be light.\nIt could be smell.\nOr in the physical\ncase of the body,\nit is where you are at in space.\nSo I'm feeling like I'm\nfalling to the left.\nTherefore, I need to correct\nand move back to the right.\nSo you don't get this\nwith doing things\nlike a hack squat on a machine.\nYou get this typically\nfrom being outside.\nSo now you're smelling\nand seeing things.\nAnd you're also not\nlanding with your foot\nin the exact same position\non an even platform.\nWe get this from\nthings like sport.\nNow I'm not only\nexercising, but I'm\nreacting to the outside world.\nThe ball is going over here,\nmy opponent's going over there.\nSo it's very important,\nin my opinion,\nto have at least one\nsession per week of exercise\nin which you are doing something\nthat challenges proprioception.\nSo how do I fold all\nof these best practices\ninto one training program that's\nnot 200 hours a week seven days\na week?\nThat's what I've\nlaid out to you.\nMake sense?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Makes sense.\nANDY GALPIN: Cool.\nLet me walk you through it.\nAnd then, maybe we'll come back\ninto each individual category\nand you can ask\nquestions about them.\nSo the way that I think\nis best is to have a goal.\nAnd have that goal be around\neight to 10 weeks long,\nlike we've been talking about.\nSo what I gave you is, let's\nstart off with quarter number\none of the year.\nSo perhaps January\nthrough March or so--\nand it doesn't have to be this\nlong, but just as an example.\nYou decide your goal is going to\nbe to put some muscle mass on.\nSo we're going to\nprioritize adding muscle.\nNow, within that, you're\ngoing to be bulking up,\nadding some muscle, but we're\nalso going to be sleeping more.\nWe know we need extra\nrecovery in this session.\nAnd we need to go\nup in calories.\nNow, this happens to work\nnice for a couple of reasons.\nBut in that\nprotocol, maybe we're\ngoing to do seven\ndays or seven sessions\na week of physical activity.\nDoesn't mean seven days.\nBut maybe those sessions\nare something like I\nwill do one indoor sport.\nThis could be basketball,\ncould be any number of things.\nSo I got my sport ticked\noff, and it's indoors.\nWhy?\nI'm in January to March.\nThe weather's probably not\ngreat for most of the world.\nSo I'm not going to do\nas much outside activity.\nI'm going to do weights maybe\nthree or four times a week,\nand then maybe two days a\nweek I'll go for a long walk.\nAgain, we'll come back\nand I'll explain to you\nwhy I made all these\nindividual choices\nso you're going to run\nthat for the first quarter.\nAt the end of this\nquarter you're\ngoing to take a de-load week.\nNow, this could be fully off.\nMaybe this is when you\nschedule a vacation.\nMaybe this is backing off.\nMaybe you just\nkeep your walks in\nand you spend the extra time\non your family, or work,\nor whatever else we need to do.\nSo we've bulked up a little bit.\nWe spent 12 weeks\nadding some mass.\nNow we're going to\ntransition into quarter two,\nwhich is where we start\nto actually get lean.\nThis is actually a pretty\nstandard bodybuilding template,\nwhich is put on some\nmass first, and then you\nget lean after that.\nSo now we're going to get\nlean from April to June.\nWe're going to bring\ncalories down a little bit.\nSo now we're actually\ngoing to play\nin a hypocaloric\ncaloric state somewhat.\nThe days tend to get longer.\nSo we're going to have more\ntime to spend in the sun.\nSo we're going to shift a\nlittle bit from an indoor sport\nactivity, like the example I\nsaid earlier was basketball,\nto maybe stand-up\npaddleboarding,\nor some other thing\nwhere you're actually\ngetting your sport\ndone, you're reacting,\nyou're using proprioception,\nbut now you're\ngetting that sun in there as\nwell because you have a greater\nopportunity to actually do\nso, and the weather probably\nis going to cooperate with\nyou more often than it would\nin, say, February.\nYou then maybe going to pick a\nfitness or an exercise class.\nAny number of routines where\nyou're with multiple people.\nAnd then, two days a\nweek in addition to that,\nyou're going to maybe\nlift some weights.\nSo now, we've added some muscle.\nNow we've got lean.\nAnd all of a sudden,\nwe're actually\nlooking pretty good\nfor the summertime.\nHmm.\nInteresting.\nQuarter three, July to\nSeptember, we'll transition,\nand we'll try to get into\ngreat cardiovascular shape.\nSo we'll transition more into\nsome high intensity interval\ntype of stuff more frequently.\nWe're going to maybe stay\nat maintenance calories now.\nWe spend a little bit of time\nhyper, then we went hypo,\nand now we're going to go back\nto maintenance and keep along.\nWe're going to continue to\nchoose some outdoor sports,\nbut maybe you change it up.\nMaybe you keep the same one.\nMaybe now we switch\nit out on the golf,\nor now we pick a pickleball,\nor we play basketball,\nbut now we just do it outside.\nAny number of things you can do.\nSo maybe even we do a couple.\nChange it up.\nYou do that twice a week.\nYou're spending more\ntime in the sun now.\nYou're looking\noutside and you're\nseeing this great weather and\nyou're not cooped up in a gym\nbut you're getting your\nphysical fitness in.\nThat's also going to be\naiding in your high intensity\nor your interval,\nyour conditioning,\nbecause you're doing\nmore stuff like that\nrather than lifting in a gym.\nAnd then, maybe\nyou're actually going\nto do some track workouts.\nMaybe we'll do this on a\nbike, or we'll do some hill\nsprints outside, any\nnumber of things.\nAnd then we'll do that\nmaybe twice a week.\nAnd then we'll still\nlift weights twice a week\nin our gym.\nThe last quarter then is going\nto be October to December.\nAnd we're going to\ntransition there\ninto more pure\ncardiovascular fitness.\nBecause we're doing that, we're\ngoing to be working harder.\nAnd remember,\ncardiovascular training\nis generally expelling much\nmore calories than lifting.\nSo we're going to actually\ngo up in calories.\nWe're going to return to that.\nAnd that works out kind of well,\nbecause I don't know if or not,\nbut people tend to eat\na little more calories\nfrom the months of, say,\nNovember through December.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nholidays, and at least\nin northern hemisphere,\ncolder temperatures.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nMaybe even we play with\ntwo workouts a day here.\nWe're trying to get\nreally in shape.\nWe're trying to improve our\nconditioning and our endurance\nin multiple areas.\nWe're going to actually\ntransition back\ninto an indoor sport.\nSo maybe we're going\nto do some kickboxing,\nor a jiu jitsu class,\nor something like that.\nWe're going to maybe hit the\ncardio machine once or twice.\nNow we're hopping on a\nStairMaster, a VersaClimber,\nmore maybe get an assault bike\ngoing, something like that.\nMaybe hit some machines\nand do our lifting there.\nMaybe we spent the rest of\nthe earlier part of the year\non barbells and dumbbells.\nWe'll transition\nto some machines.\nAnd then we'll still try to get\noutside and walk twice a week.\nAnd that gets us our\noutside activity,\nbut it's not necessarily\na structured program.\nSo we've got 15 minutes\nwhere the weather's\nbreaking a little bit.\nSo let's walk, get\noutside, and get a walk in.\nSo that's the overall\nstructure of everything.\nI would like to actually\ngo back to the beginning\nnow and walk through each\none of these things in detail\nand explain why I\nchose certain things.\nI've kind of given\nsome hints already.\nBut I think it'd be helpful\nto walk back to the beginning\nand start there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nI of the overall structure.\nI have just a\ncouple of questions.\nThe idea of training mostly\nfor hypertrophy January\nthrough March makes sense.\nFollowed by a period from April\nthrough June focusing primarily\non fat loss.\nAnd then from July to September,\nspeed and interval type work.\nAnd then October\nto December, you\nput to emphasize\nendurance type training.\nI thought for a moment that when\nwe got to October, December,\nyou were going to\nemphasize strength.\nAnd I'm wondering\nwhether or not there's\nany incentive for training for\nstrength October, December,\nso that when one arrives\nat the hypertrophy training\nJanuary through March,\nwe're that much stronger.\nThe idea being then there's\nmore muscle to hold on to as one\nthen tries to lose fat\nfrom April through June.\nAnd then July through\nSeptember is the speed work.\nOr is July through\nSeptember the speed\nslash power phase\nof the program?\nANDY GALPIN: The July\nthrough September\nwould be more like\nyour higher heart rate,\nlearning to get all the way\nup, maximum exertion, and then\nrecovering.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: An\nOctober to December\nis long-form endurance?\nANDY GALPIN: Moderate\nto long-form.\nSo it's closer to that\naerobic capacity stuff.\nIt is closer to longer\nduration and moving\nthrough that spectrum.\nYou are astute in pointing\nout that I didn't have\npure strength really in there.\nYou certainly could fold it in.\nBut quite literally, if you\nspent three months bulking up\nin January to\nMarch, that's going\nto bring some strength\nalong the way.\nSo you should be fine there.\nBut you absolutely could\nalter any of these variables\nif you want to emphasize\nsomething more than other one.\nSo say you actually felt like\nyou ran through the fitness\ntesting.\nAnd you identified, actually,\nyour endurance is pretty good.\nBut you're struggling maybe\nwith a little bit of strength\nand maybe a little bit\nof lower muscle mass.\nYou could substitute quarter\nthree or quarter four\nand say, one of those\nquarters will be strength.\nAnd then I'll do all\nof my conditioning\nin another quarter.\nAnd what you've really\ndone is the programming\nis still fairly simple.\nYou've just altered the\npriorities a little bit.\nAnd therefore, you've altered\nthe adaptation across the year.\nAnd why this is\nreally important,\nthis template is meant to be\nsomething you can just run back\nyear after year after year.\nAnd you make a subtle\nchange like that.\nAnd now, over the course\nof five, 10, 20 years,\nyou're going to be in a\nfantastic spot at the end.\nSo you can make easy\nadjustments along the way\nas priorities pop\nup, as goals pop up.\nBut you're going\nto be in a position\nwhere everything is--\nthere's nothing that's\ngoing to be lagging behind.\nYou'll be in a good spot.\nMost of your bases are\ncovered to be pretty lean,\nhave a good amount of muscle,\nand to be in great shape.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nTwo other questions.\nOne just a quick question.\nFor sake of generating\nproprioceptive feedback--\nduring the endurance phase, is\ntrail-running a good option?\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nThinking back to the days\nrunning cross-country.\nIt's October, December,\nyou're trail-running.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nTraining for endurance.\nANDY GALPIN: The ground\nis not super solid,\nwhich is even\nbetter in this case.\nSo you're making more\nchoices and trying\nto not fall on your face.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.\nAnd then you\nmentioned bulking up.\nAnd I just wanted to highlight\nthat there are some folks,\nmyself included, while I'd like\nto add a little bit of muscle\nhere or there, I'm not\ninterested in overeating\nto the point where I\nlay down a lot of body\nfat stores along with that.\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I think\na lot of people out there\nare not necessarily interested\nin, quote unquote, bulking up.\nI also-- my understanding\nof the literature--\nand tell me if I'm wrong--\nis that while there\ndoes need to be\nsome sort of caloric\nsurplus above what\nis required to maintain\nbody weight in order\nto build muscle,\nthat many people who\ntry and, quote unquote,\nbulk up basically just\nend up expanding the\nsize of their cheeks\nand face along with\ntheir limbs and torso.\n[LAUGHS]\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm not\ntrying to poke fun at them.\nBut the idea of\ndeliberately overeating\nto the point where a lot of\nbody fat stores come along,\nI would imagine that would just\nmake the April through June\nphase that much harder.\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nI'm not sure it's ever\nbeen studied directly.\nBut I can't imagine\nit's all that--\nexcuse me, all that\nhealthy, to bring along\na lot of adipose tissue in\none's pursuit of hypertrophy.\nANDY GALPIN: You're\nabsolutely correct.\nWe have not gotten into the\nnutritional details there.\nBut yeah, thank you.\nGood clarification point.\nA couple of things.\nYou're not going to be\ndoing this very long.\nIt's 12 weeks.\nWe're not going to be six,\nseven, or eight months.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nhaven't seen me eat.\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDY GALPIN: Number two, just\nsince we're here to clarify,\nthe literature is\nongoing in this area.\nAnd there's actually\na handful of studies\nthat I know are coming soon.\nBut in general, when I\nsay hypercaloric here,\nI'm referring to an increasing\ncaloric intake above baseline\nby something like 10% to 15%.\nSo if you normally eat 2,500\ncalories throughout the day,\nyou might add\nanother 250 to 400.\nI'm not doubling calories.\nI don't want you to\nbe stuffing your face,\nhating food, feeling\nawful all day,\nand then putting on half\nof your weight as fat\nand half your weight as muscle.\nIt is just technically\nhypercaloric\nbecause you're\neating more, which\nis an absolute requirement\nfor most people to add muscle.\nSome folks who have a high\npercentage of body fat\nand a low level of\nfitness training\ncan actually get\naway with just being\neither isocaloric, technically,\nor even a little bit lower,\nand still adding some muscle\nwhile losing some fat.\nBut for most folks, that's\ngoing to be challenging.\nSo you're going to want to\nbe in a hypercaloric state.\nAnother reason I put it in\nhere is because, remember,\npeople tend to make\nthese extra calorie\nchoices during this part\nof the year anyways.\nAnd so, you're playing into\nlife is why I chose that.\nIt's like, hey, you can't\nrestrict calories all the time.\nIt's really, really hard.\nSo maybe if we can put\nit calorie restriction\nduring the phases of the year\nthat's a little bit easier,\nand give you the freedom\nto have a little bit\nmore calories during\nthe phase of the year\nwhen you're probably going\nto want to do that anyways.\nJust make sure you're doing\na style of training that\nsupports that.\nSo you're going to be\ntrying to add muscle\nwhen you know you're going\nto be adding more calories.\nWe're going to be\ntrying to really push\nthe pace on our\nconditioning when\nwe know we're going to be\neating more calories anyways.\nAnd so, that is\nactually, in fact,\nexactly why I chose those goals\nfor those times of the year.\nIt's because we're now playing\ninto life a little bit more.\nBut we, again, certainly do not\nwant to be eating to an excess\nor where it's causing some of\nthe problems you mentioned.\nWe just need to be\neating a little bit more.\nThe last point here is, the\nnext phase, April to June,\nwe know we're going hypocaloric.\nSo it's always kind\nof nice to go, yeah,\nwe're going to go in a little\nbit of a calorie deficit here.\nBut it's really just\nthese few months.\nAnd it's OK, because I spent\nthe last six months where\nI wasn't restricting that much,\nand then one actually where\nI got to eat a little bit more.\nAnd now, cool, not hard\nfor me to convince somebody\nthat to go we're going to\nbring the calories down right\nnow, or in a month,\nin two months.\nAnd it's just going to be\nthis 12 or 16-week phase,\nor whatever you end\nup being in there.\nSo those were some\nof the rationale\nthat I was thinking of\nwhen I decided to do that.\nBut thank you.\nThat's a very important point\nin terms of the hypocaloric.\nIt's not the dirty bulk.\nIt's not the excess that\na lot of folks will do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd just a final\npoint for folks in the\nSouthern hemisphere, Australia,\nand South Americans.\nANDY GALPIN: Ah,\nflip everything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We actually\nhave a large listenership\nin the Southern hemisphere.\nOf course, adjust accordingly.\nEven though the holiday\nmonths are still\nin November, December,\nthere are, of course,\nholidays all year long.\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nYou got Fourth of July.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Many,\nmany of the major holidays\nare around November, December.\nBut it's summer down there.\nJust adjust accordingly.\nThere's nothing\nholy about trying\nto achieve certain adaptations\nat certain times of year.\nIt's more about trying\nto eliminate bottlenecks,\ndefenders, as you mentioned.\nAnd it's really\nabout the sequence.\nANDY GALPIN: So if we go\nback to that first quarter,\nwe're going to try to add\nsome mass, for the reasons\nI just described.\nIt's also tends to\nbe pretty motivating.\nYou're going to\nstart the year off.\nYou're going to want to train\nand get all excited because\nof your New Year's resolution.\nAnd you're going to see\nresults immediately.\nWe've talked about this in\nsome of the previous episodes.\nThe nice part about\nhypertrophy training\nis you see your muscles\ngrowing right now.\nWhere the endurance stuff\ntends to have a little bit more\nof a delayed gratification.\nSo I'm going to give\nyou a win early.\nNow, we're also going\nto be sleeping more.\nBecause we know--\nand maybe we'll\nget into this in\na future episode--\nthat sleep is absolutely\ncritical to recovery\nand critical to\ngrowing muscle mass.\nSo you're going\nto emphasize sleep\nmore during this\npart of the year\nalso because the\nsun is very low.\nIt's harder to sleep\nfor a lot of folks\nlonger when the sun\nis out for longer,\nespecially if you don't have\na perfect blackout curtain.\nAnd so, you're\njust trying to play\nwith the restrictions life gives\nyou and optimize your scenario.\nSo the sun's probably\nnot out very often.\nAnd especially,\ndepending on where\nyou live, if you're anywhere\nlike where I grew up\nin the Pacific\nNorthwest, [LAUGHS]\nit's going to be dark, and gray,\nand gloomy most of the day.\nSo it's not hard to convince you\nto go sleep a little bit more\noften.\nSo we'll do that.\nThat's also, again, why\nI chose an indoor sport.\nThat activity, you're going to\nnot shoot yourself in the foot.\nBeing in the gym when\nit's cold and crappy\noutside is not that hard\nto convince yourself to do.\nSo you're going to be lifting\nyour weights, say, four times\na week.\nAnd then, again, getting\nsome outside time\nin the form of a walk\nso that you can do it\nin the middle of\nwork if you have to,\nor catching 20 minutes here or\nthere, whatever it needs to be.\nThe chances of you missing\nthat walk are little.\nAnd you'll still get\nsome outside time.\nYou've talked about the\nimportance of getting sunlight\nin even if it is overcast.\nSo you can still\nnail all those boxes\nand be in a pretty good spot\nat the end of that quarter.\nSo moving on to quarter\ntwo then, April to June.\nA lot of people want to look\ngood during the summer months.\nYou're more likely\nto be outside.\nYou're more likely to have your\nshirt off because it's hot,\nbecause you're\neither on vacation,\nor going to the beach.\nSo let's play into\nthat a little bit.\nLet's let people look\na little bit better,\nif that's what they determine\nto be looking better,\nduring the months when they're\nmore likely to have that.\nYou're also more likely to\nhave things like weddings\nover the summertime.\nPeople don't get married\noften in the winter.\nAnd so, people want to\nlook good for these events.\nSo let's play into what a\nlot of people already want.\nAnd let's help you get leaner.\nNot a lot of\nholidays that involve\neating during that phase.\nAnd so, you're not going to\nfeel like you're missing out\non a ton of life outside of\nmaybe a few smaller holidays\nin that phase.\nThe days are getting longer.\nAnd so, we're going to choose\nto get in the sun more often.\nWe can start getting\na tan better.\nWe can start getting\nready for summer.\nAnd so, that's is why we\nexchanged our indoor sport\nfor an outdoor sport--\nsurfing, hiking,\ncycling outside,\nwhatever the thing\nis you want to do.\nThere's tons of them.\nKiteboarding, like I said,\nskateboarding-- there you go.\nGet out and start skating\na little bit, whatever\nit needs to be.\nSo we'll do that\nonce a week or so.\nAnd then I actually threw\nin a fitness class here.\nAnd there's a couple of reasons.\nOne, now it's sort of nice to\ntake the pressure programming\noff.\nIt's also nice\nto, if you've been\nlifting by yourself,\nto get in there\nand lift with somebody else.\nIt's also nice to now have\nsome social interaction.\nThe gamification, the\ngroup, the scoring stuff\nthat happens in fitness\nclasses is very, very powerful.\nIt tends to be\nsomewhat fleeting.\nSo it won't last\nfor a long time,\nfor some people, others it does.\nAnd so, if you\npepper this thing in\nand you know you're going\nto join this activity class,\neven if it's not great and the\nprogram design isn't perfect,\nit's fine for 10 weeks.\nIn fact, you may\nreally, really enjoy it.\nAnd also, again, it gives you\nsomething new to think about.\nMusic is on.\nYou're out of your house if\nyou're lifting at your house.\nYou're in a different\npart of the gym.\nThe schedule is\na little tighter.\nSo you can't just go work\nout whenever you want.\nYou've got to show up\nwhen the class is going.\nAnd you'll probably find\nthat you just love it.\nYou also get some\nsocial interaction,\nwhich is something that's also\nvery important that we haven't\nreally discussed yet, if\nyou're out playing basketball\nby yourself or whatnot.\nSo this is just\nanother thing I'm\ntrying to fold in that still\nallows you to check off\nmultiple boxes of things\nthat are healthy for you.\nYou've had episodes on the\nimportance of social connection\ninteraction.\nWe talked about that\nin the quad breakdown\nof making sure you\nhave relationship time\nand things like that.\nSo throwing in a fitness\nclass and just doing,\nhonestly, something quite\ndifferent is pretty fun.\nBut then, still,\nkeeping two days a week\nwhere you're doing a\ntraditional strength training\nthing so you have some\nquality control there.\nLastly, you can also\nthen make sure you're\nhitting any specific movements\nor muscle groups that\nare very important to you.\nSo you don't get to control\nthat in your fitness class.\nBut now you can at\nleast do the gym\nand make sure you hit\nthat muscle group that you\nhave an interest in it.\nSo now we're\nfeeling pretty good.\nWe're rolling into the summer.\nWe're pretty lean.\nWe're getting out\nin the sun a lot.\nWe're bringing calories\ndown a little bit.\nAnd we probably are\nfeeling pretty happy.\nWe're also not burnt out.\nWe've done a lot of fun things.\nAnd we've checked\na lot of the boxes\noff for long-term development.\nWe had a combination\nof specificity\nwith exercise selection.\nBut we also folded in just\na little bit of variation\nso we don't have to worry\nabout overuse injury of doing\nthe same machines, the same\nlift, months, and months,\nand months, after months, and\nslowly wearing down something\nif our technique isn't perfect.\nSo now we're going to\ngo into our quarter\nthree, which is the summer\nmonths, basically, up here\nat least, July to September.\nWe'll transition.\nIt's been a while since\nwe've done some conditioning.\nSo we may have lost a little\ncardiorespiratory fitness.\nWe may have-- not\nfeeling great anymore,\nmaybe energy throughout the day\nstuff is starting to leak down.\nSo we're going to get in shape.\nWe're going to push\nour heart rate high.\nAnd we're going to bring\nthe calories back up.\nThe summertime, 4th of July,\nother holidays like this where\neating is involved,\nmaybe you're going\nto sporting events\nand things like that.\nOur sport choices is often\ngoing to be outdoors.\nBut in fact, what you'll\nnotice here is, is I've\nramped the sport choice\nup to twice a week.\nAnd in fact, I\nwould encourage you\nto do two different\ntypes of exercise.\nAnd one of the primary\nreasons for that\nis to spend more time outside.\nA challenge we often\nsee with people with\nexercises going, man,\nit's so nice outside.\nI can't go sit in the\ngym for 45 minutes.\nI don't have that\nmuch free time.\nAnd then, Huberman's\nover here telling me\nI need to get direct\nsunlight more.\nHow am I going to fit this in?\nWell, do your exercise outside.\nEnjoy it.\nNow, if you live\ndown here like us,\nyou take sunshine for granted.\nBut a lot of people I\nknow it's like, it's\nonly nice for two and\n1/2 months of the year.\nGet outside.\nSo let's push more of\nour fitness training\nto outdoor activities.\nThese sports can\nbe intense or not.\nIt could be go out\nthere and swim hard.\nGet in the ocean.\nYou're going to do open ocean\nswimming instead of swimming\nin the pool indoors, or\nwhatever the case may be.\nSo we're going to give ourselves\nmore of a priority of being\noutside, looking--\nwe've looked pretty good.\nWe're a little tan.\nAnd we're enjoying all the\nbenefits of training outside\nand the lack of structure.\nStill, we have structured,\nbut not so specific\nlike the machines and\nthe weights give us.\nMaybe even now we're\ndoing some track workouts.\nSo now we can do something\nlike sprint the straightaways,\nwalk the corners.\nAnd we don't have to,\nagain, do our conditioning\non the same StairMaster, or\nmachine, or whatever we're on.\nSo we're going to enjoy\nsome stuff like that.\nWe're going to be athletic.\nWe're going to run.\nWe're going to move.\nWe haven't talked\nabout that yet.\nEverything has really been\nabout structured exercise.\nWell, now we're going\nto do some sprint work.\nWe're going to get out\nand see that, which\nis a really important human\nquality that, I think,\nis important to not lose, is\nactually ability to sprint.\nSo we'll do that.\nAnd then we'll still make\nsure we lift twice a week\nfor the same reasons I talked\nabout in the previous phase.\nSo we make sure we have\nsome quality control there.\nWe maintain some of the muscle\nthat we built in the quarter\nbefore.\nWe don't lose too much strength.\nThere is very good literature\nto suggest strength maintenance\ncan be done in as little\nas five sets per week\nfor a very long time, really\nup to eight-plus weeks\nif you do a little bit.\nSo you're touching it enough\nwhere you're not going\nto get really, really weak.\nBut what you wouldn't want\nto do is go 12 or 16 weeks\nwhere you lifted no weights.\nAnd maybe you got\nin great shape,\nbut you're going to feel\nvery weak after that.\nSo maybe that number could\ncome down to one time a week\nif you really wanted it to.\nBut one to two days\na week where you're\nlifting the big exercises,\nthe muscle groups\nand movements of interest,\nand you're good to go.\nThen, lastly, we roll\ninto our final quarter,\nwhich is October to December.\nAnd we're going to really\nget in great shape.\nThe sun is starting\nto come down.\nWe're rolling into the holidays.\nWeather's getting worse.\nWe may have other\noutdoor activities\nwe want to do, like, in my case,\nyou're going on a hunting trip,\nyou have some\ntravel, conferences,\nwhatever the case may be.\nAnd so, we're going to\nchoose an indoor sport.\nAnd I love combat sports.\nSo the example I gave\nearlier was jujitsu.\nOr maybe you just\ntransition your basketball\nto inside, or your\npickleball comes inside,\nor whatever it happens to be.\nAnd you're still going to\nhave that twice a week.\nAnd then, maybe instead of\nthe track workout outside,\nyou do that same\nworkout indoors,\nnow back on some sort of\nmachine or something like that.\nOur weights are actually\nnow down to once a week\nbecause we're really pushing\nthe pace on cardiovascular.\nWe're doing once a week to\nmaintain it, to not lose,\nand get too far behind.\nBut we really want to\nbring up our VO2 max.\nWe want to bring up our\nefficiency, our cardiac output,\nand everything like that.\nAnd we're still going to\nnow walk twice a week so\nthat we get something outside.\nAnd I talked about\nwhy, again, it's\nnice to have that flexibility\nof not having to train outside,\nbecause now you got to warm\nup and do all those things.\nWe just get out\nand get a walk in.\nYou still get the\noutdoor experience.\nSo we run through\nthat entire thing.\nAnd then you just start\nback the next year.\nIdeally, again, at the\nend of every quarter,\nyou take a week off.\nWhether that is a\ntrue full week off,\nwhich I'm fully supportive.\nI mean, friends, we're\nonly talking about four\noff weeks a year.\nThat's absolutely fine.\nOr it could even be\na slight de-load week\nif you want it to be.\nSo we shouldn't run into\ntoo many issues of overuse.\nWe have a lot of variety.\nWe get a lot of\nmovement patterns\nin because we're mixing in sport\nwith machines and dumbbells.\nWe're mixing in\nsocial interaction.\nWe're mixing in the sun.\nWe're mixing in enjoyment.\nWe're mixing in fat loss,\nstrength, hypertrophy,\nsome cardiovascular endurance.\nWe're mixing in\ncalories in high,\nwe're mixing a little\nbit of calories low.\nAnd we're trying to hit as many\nof these nodes as possible.\nIf you also wanted to cut each\none of these a little bit short\nand repeat your fitness testing\nat the end of every quarter,\nyou could.\nI would probably recommend\ndoing it at least once a year.\nPerhaps doing it maybe the\nthird week of December or so.\nSo you run that testing.\nThat's your last\nweek of training.\nThen you get to go on\nyour vacation break.\nYou come back at the\nbeginning of the year.\nYou've got new goals,\nnew targets and you go.\nIf you want to repeat it twice a\nyear, do the same sort of thing\nat the end of June.\nIt's fine.\nI know I laid these out as\nquarters, which is generally 12\nweeks, with one back-off week.\nBut if you wanted to make it\nnine weeks and a testing week,\nand then a back-off,\nor 10 weeks, it's fine.\nIt's close enough.\nSo the last little\nthing I want to say\nis, let's assume you're\ndoing the 12 weeks.\nAnd you're going to\nhave a back-off week\nat the end of the 12 weeks.\nI would actually still then\nrecommend having at least one\nback-off week halfway through.\nSo it would look like this.\nFive weeks hard where\nyou're progressing.\nYou're going up, up, up, up, up.\nEvery week you're either\nincreasing volume intensity\nlike we talked about\na few minutes ago.\nThen week six, de-load.\nGo down to 70% volume intensity.\nCome back.\nGo hard for five more weeks.\nAnd now, week 12 is your true\noff week where you, again,\ntake the whole thing off.\nIf you do that, you now\nhave four weeks a year\nwhere you're totally off.\nYou have four weeks a year where\nyou're really backing down.\nAnd you just have\nfive-week segments\nall year round where\nyou're just going\nto push it hard for five weeks.\nYou're going to get a break.\nYou're going to\nreset, and you're\ngoing to transition\na little bit.\nNow, as I started this\nconversation off with,\nthere are many ways you could\nstructure your training program\nthroughout the year and hit\nthose primary goals we talked\nabout of looking fantastic,\nfeeling amazing, and being\nable to do that\nyour entire life.\nAll I can tell you, though,\nis I know this model works.\nBecause we've done this\na lot with our clients\nin our rapid health\noptimization program.\nAnd this spans everything\nfrom 25-year-old folks\nwho are competing in\nthe Boston Marathon\nto a lot of individuals who\nhave never exercised before,\nwho maybe have done a\nlittle bit of exercise.\nIn fact, it's quite literally\nall three of the buckets\nyou laid out.\nWe've had clients in\nall of those areas,\nboth men and women,\nyoung and old.\nAnd we've had a tremendous\namount of success transforming\ntheir lives using a very similar\nmodel to what I just laid out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I find\nthat overall structure\nto be immensely informative.\nAnd I'll tell you why in the\ncontext of a number of examples\nwith myself, although that's\nthe least important of them,\nfrankly, but examples of family\nmembers of mine and friends\nof mine who've\nundertaken consistent\nexercise training\nprograms but that haven't\nvaried the program so much.\nAnd here, again, I\nthink of the person\nwho really loves to swim.\nThey have a low barrier of entry\nto the pool or to the ocean.\nThey love being in the water.\nI am not one such person.\nI like being in the\nwater, but I don't\nmotivate to drive to the\npool or to bike to the pool\nor to get into the\nocean that often.\nOnce I do it, I enjoy it.\nBut for me it's running\nand lifting weights.\nAnd it has been for\na very long time.\nI have a family member,\nclose family member,\nwho doesn't really like,\nquote unquote, exercise,\nbut loves dance and dancing.\nGoing out dancing, yes, but\ndance classes in particular.\nANDY GALPIN: Amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nReally enjoys it.\nLoves to be distracted from the\nfact that she's doing exercise\nand just really enjoys it.\nAnd actually is a\nvery good dancer\ndespite the fact that\nshe's related to me.\nAnd on and on.\nThere are many\nexamples, I think,\nof folks that fall into the\ndifferent bins that we talked\nabout earlier but that also\ntend to default towards a given\nstructure of training\none way and doing that\nthroughout the year.\nI can tell you right\nnow that I'm personally\ngoing to modify my\nschedule according\nto this four quarters per year.\nIt actually works\nbecause I've mostly\nbeen on the quarter system in\nacademics for a very long time.\nI was at a university that\nhad a semester system once.\nBut this quarter system\nis actually the one\nthat we follow academically.\nSo that's one reason why\nit's a natural fit for me.\nI confess that I\ntypically don't vary up\nthe proportions of endurance\nto resistance training.\nI tend to keep those about\nthree and three across the week.\nThree resistance\ntraining sessions, three,\nlet's call them cardio sessions.\nBut each one designed to\nachieve a different adaptation.\nAnd I've now altered\nthose even further\nbased on your recommendations\nin this episode\nand previous episodes.\nBut what I have not done is\nto really think about de-load\nand to really stick\nto the structure\nthat I set out to\naccomplish across the year.\nOn the topic of de-load,\nfor me, the de-load\nhas been when I get overwhelmed\nwith work, or I've gotten sick.\nI don't tend to get\nsick that often.\nBut every once in a\nwhile I get knocked back\nwith a cold or a flu.\nOnce every three or\nfour years I seem\nto really get hammered with\na fever-inducing something\nor other.\nAnd then I'm bedridden\nfor a couple of days.\nAnd then I'm back at it.\nAnd I tend to come\nback rather slowly.\nAnd that tends to\nbe my week off.\nBut I'm beginning to\nwonder whether or not\npart of the reason I hit those\nstreaks of being overwhelmed\nby sickness or by stress\nis that I have not\ndone a de-load period.\nSo one of the things that I'm\ngoing to immediately implement\nis a periodic de-load\naccording to the program\nthat you described.\nAnd I'm also going to start\nmatching my specific goals\nfor each quarter\nwith time of year.\nI don't think I've done that.\nAnd it's not because\nI live in California.\nAnd by the way, folks, there\nare temperature variations\nand amount of light across the\nday variations in California\nas well, although they\nare not as dramatic\nas they would be near the\nNorth Pole, for instance.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nThey're pretty moderate.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nBut of course, some of the\nlisteners are at the equator.\nSo they have the opposite issue.\nIn any event, I'm\ndefinitely going to do that.\nI'm going to start incorporating\nregular de-load periods.\nAnd I am going to be\nvery dedicated, very\ndisciplined about sticking\nto a program for three\nmonths devoted mainly\nto hypertrophy,\nthen a three-month program\ndevoted to fat loss,\nthen a program devoted\nto aerobic output,\nand then one devoted\nto endurance.\nAlthough I must say,\nit's very tempting for me\nto do a very specific\nstrength-dedicated portion.\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Because I don't\ntend to be particularly strong.\nI'm not weak, but I'm\nnot particularly strong.\nSo I might consult with\nyou as to how I could\nvary endurance and strength.\nIn any event, I love the\nidea of a macro-structure.\nAnd I love the idea of\nde-loads in anticipation\nof being able to go further\nin the long-run in terms\nof results.\nI'm hoping this next\nyear, because we're just\non the cusp of a new year, will\nbe the first year in which I\ndon't find myself getting\nsome bug, or virus,\nor whatever it happens\nto be from time to time\nand having to back off on\ntraining for that reason.\nAnd that prompts a question.\nAnd it's something\nthat I want to get\ninto in more detail with you\nwhen you describe recovery--\nan upcoming episode.\nBut a couple of quick questions.\nMaybe there are some\nshort or short-ish answers\nyou could provide.\nIf I'm not feeling\nwell, like I really\nhad a poor night's sleep.\nMaybe just two to four hours\nof sleep for whatever reason.\nTrain or don't train?\nThat's the first question.\nSecond question\nis, if I'm starting\nto feel a little bit\nof a throat tickle,\nand I'm in that phase of\ndenial, like I don't get sick,\nI'm not getting sick.\nAnd would I be better off\nbundling up some hot liquids,\ngetting into bed, sleeping\nin a little bit more,\net cetera, and protecting\nmyself against that,\nor would I be\nbetter off training?\nAnd if I've-- and then\nthe third question is--\nif I've already succumbed to a\nbug, but it's not a severe bug.\nI don't have elevated\nbody temperature.\nSo no fever.\nI'm not hacking up,\nnot productive cough\nor anything like that.\nBut I'm feeling just\nkind of not well,\nhead cold-ish sort of\nthing comes to mind,\nand it's not seasonal\nallergies, train or don't train,\nleaving aside the\npoint of whether or not\nI'm in a position to\nget anyone else sick.\nBecause obviously\nthat's a bad idea.\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So lack of\nsleep, I would say, 30% to 40%\nof one's typical sleep\nthe previous night,\ntrain or no train?\nStarting to feel like\none might be getting ill.\nAnd then the third category is\ncoming back from being sick.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thanks.\nAnd sorry for the\nextended question,\nbut I want to make sure there\nwas enough detail there,\nbecause I think these are\nthree common scenarios.\nANDY GALPIN: We\nare going to cover\nthat in the recovery\nconversation\nthat's next in detail.\nAnd I will give you very\nspecific guidelines.\nAnd we'll have plenty\nof time to go into that.\nThe quick answer\nis, it comes back\nto what phase of\ntraining you're in.\nNow, to walk through\neach scenario.\nIf it is a crummy\nnight of sleep,\nand I am in a phase of\ntraining in which we are trying\nto cause adaptation, I have a\nlot of space in my schedule,\nand I'm really using this\ntime to make progress\nbecause I know coming up\nsoon my schedule will change\nand my time to\ntrain will go down.\nI'm still training.\nI might use a bunch\nof tricks that we\nhave for feeling\nbetter instantaneously.\nWe call these little hacks.\nThese are acute hacks.\nThese are not chronic hacks.\nI'm going to push the pace.\nIf it is really close\nto a de-load week.\nSay it's Wednesday and I\nstart my de-load next week.\nOr this is not one\nbad night of sleep,\nthis has been four bad nights\nof sleep in the last five days.\nThis has been six\nkind of crummy nights\nover the course\nof the last nine,\nand you're starting to\nsee a larger pattern,\nthen that's a different answer.\nSo the question we're\ngoing to ask ourselves\nis, is this acute?\nOr is this a tendency, or\nactually a chronic thing?\nIf it's acute, and\nwe're close, we're\ngoing to train through it.\nIf it's acute and this is\nnot a phase of training\nwhen we're trying to\nreally push, then maybe we\nback off a little bit.\nIf it's the opposite\nthough, we need\nto probably make some\nchanges and give ourselves\nsome recovery.\nThis may include anything from\na moderate training session,\nmaybe I'm going to go in the\nsauna and sit through that,\nand then do some breathing\ndrills and some mobility stuff.\nGreat.\nMaybe I'm going to go to the gym\nand ride the bike at 50% heart\nrate.\nSomething restorative like that.\nGives you a little bit of energy\nbut doesn't beat you down.\nThat's probably\nwhere we're learning.\nIf you're feeling sick\nand you think it's coming,\nI'm probably going\nto do option two\nas well, which is some sort\nof restorative training.\nSo again, this tends\nto be moderate.\nCould be weights.\nCould be any of the stuff.\nMaybe you're going to go out\nfor your swim or whatever.\nBut we're not going to push\npast probably about 70%.\nWe can absolutely\ninduce immunosuppression\nwith excessive training.\nAnd so, you may want\nto walk out of that.\nThe last case, which was, I\nthink, phase number three,\nyou said there, which is, I got\na pretty gnarly cold right now.\nAm I going to train?\nMost of the time for most\npeople, I'm just going to say,\njust shut it down.\nGet out of there.\nIf you're not going to be able\nto get productivity done there,\nyou may be better off either\ngoing and sleeping, catching up\non work doing other stuff.\nSo that the next time you go\nto train you don't feel behind\nand we can give a good\nsolid effort for it.\nI\nKnow other people who will\ntrain right through it.\nI tend to not, to\nbe totally frank.\nIf I'm feeling kind of junky,\nI'm really not going to train.\nI may actually probably do\nsome hot water immersion.\nSo bath, Jacuzzi,\nthings like that.\nI actually like those\nbetter than I like sauna.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If one is ill?\nOr you just like them better\nthan the sauna generally?\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, both, actually.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh my.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: First\nperson I've ever met or come\non this podcast to say\nyou like baths and Jacuzzi\nmore than sauna.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.\nI may even do some ice.\nProbably not a ton though.\nBecause you've got\nto be careful there.\nThat's a big stressor.\nAnd if you're already\nover the line,\nyou may be adding a pass there.\nOr I may go sleep.\nIf I'm feeling very,\nvery, very sleepy,\nand sometimes depending on\nwhat kind of a bug you get,\nthat can happen.\nI will just sleep.\nAnd that might be the\nbest choice you have.\nIf that means you kick the\ncold half a day earlier,\nthen you just won\nin the aggregate.\nSo those are probably--\nit's a little bit of\ninsight of the algorithm\nthat I'm running\nwith those things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those are\nhighly informative answers.\nThank you.\nAnd I look forward to our\ndiscussion about recovery\nso that we can go into even\nmore depth on how to recover.\nANDY GALPIN: The last\nthing I do want to say\nhere is going back to\nour quarter system.\nThe examples I gave\nwith the bulking up,\nlosing fat, and then\ngetting into better fitness\nand cardiovascular\nfitness at the end,\nthose were just samples.\nFriends, please don't\ntake that literally.\nIf you want to\nemphasize strength more,\nput in some more strength.\nIf you want to emphasize a\ndifferent one of our nine\nadaptations, great.\nDo that too.\nIf you're somebody who has\na lot of body fat to lose,\nthen maybe put that for\ntwo consecutive sessions,\nor every other.\nYou can modify them.\nWe've talked about nine very\nspecific training adaptations\nas well as in fat loss.\nI only gave you\nfour, which is just\nmeant to be a sample that\nyou can roll in or out.\nBut use those priorities to\nadjust that system according\nto what is important\nfor you now, five years,\nand then 45 years down the\nline for whatever that may be.\nSo you are absolutely\nfree to modify the order.\nYou're absolutely free to\nmodify the primary outcome.\nAnd then, adjust the\nspecifics within each quarter\nbased upon what is needed to\ndo to optimize that outcome.\nI think maybe one\nmore tool we can\noffer people is maybe giving\nthe individual week a little bit\nmore structure.\nSo the system I laid\nout is month by month.\nAnd maybe we can lay out,\nsay, a three-day a week\nworkout program and a\nfour-day a week program.\nThat would still hit some of the\nsame well-rounded adaptations.\nThat probably covers maybe\nnot individualized per bucket\nthat we've talked about.\nA, B, and C, but\nit's going to cover\n75%, 80% of what we'll need\nto occur in all three buckets.\nAnd then, you can use that last\n25% for your individual goal\nor specialization.\nSo maybe we can\njump into that next.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nLet's hear it.\nANDY GALPIN: The\nfirst one I want\nto give you is just a\nbasic three-day split.\nThat, again, same idea.\nIt's a well-rounded\nexercise program.\nI actually wrote this\nall in an article\nthat is on XPT's website.\nSo perhaps we can\nlink directly to that.\nI will just jump you\nstraight to the answer.\nYou can read more about why\nand details in that article\nif you'd like.\nBut this is day one,\nday two, day three.\nYou could do these days\nwhere you split them up,\nactually having, say,\n24 hours in between,\nor you could do\nthese back to back.\nIt doesn't necessarily matter.\nIn this particular\ncase, say, day one\nyou would start off and do a\nlittle bit of speed and power.\nAnd then you may finish\nthat with a little bit\nof hypertrophy.\nNow, if you want to gain\nmore speed and power\nyou just do more of it.\nIf you want to maybe just\ndo a little bit to touch it,\nand you really want\nto gain some muscle,\nyou would do more of\nan emphasis there.\nSo the template\ncan stay the same,\nand you would just increase the\namount of either adaptation,\nthe speed and power\nstuff, or the hypertrophy,\nbased on how high it is\nin your priority list.\nThose are combined together\nbecause, as we talked\nabout earlier, they\ndon't necessarily\ninterfere with each other.\nYou would do the speed\nand power stuff first\nbecause it wouldn't\nhamper the hypertrophy.\nIf you did the hypertrophy\nfirst in that workout,\nit would probably compromise\nyour speed and power.\nAnd in that case, you\nwould actually not\nbe getting your adaptation.\nSo day one you do that.\nAnd that could be a 20-minute\nworkout total, or a two and 1/2\nhour, up to you.\nThen you would come back maybe\nthe next day or two days later,\nwhatever you'd like to do.\nIn your second day\nof exercise, you\nwould start off with a\npure strength protocol.\nAnd you would finish that\nwith what I'm calling just\na higher heart rate.\nSo this could be something like\nour anaerobic capacity stuff.\nIt could be the\naerobic capacity,\nsomething where you're getting\nup to close to high heart rate.\nIt could be those\n20-second bursts.\nIt could be a 90-second burst,\nfive-minute mile repeats,\nanything you like.\nYou can just plug\nand play this in.\nYou're getting to\na spot now where\nyou've had a little\nbit of speed,\na little bit of strength, a\nlittle bit of hypertrophy,\nand you've touched\nthe high heart rate.\nSo we've checked off most of the\nboxes already in two sessions.\nOur last session then would\nbe more of a steady state\nlong duration endurance.\nAnd so, a three-day\nweek split like that\nis going to be a pretty nice\nsetup for the average person.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthis could be a Monday,\nWednesday, Friday, Tuesday,\nThursday, Saturday.\nWhat's happening on\nthe intervening days?\nANDY GALPIN: Totally off\nif you want it to be.\nSo I set this up as the\nbest I can give you,\nAndy, is three days.\nGreat.\nIf you have more, we could\ncertainly improve it.\nBut this was my\nworst case scenario.\nI've got other\nthings in my life.\nThe most I could do for\nexercise is three days a week.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\ngiven that it's three days\nper week, how long--\napproximately how long each of\nthese workouts going to last?\nANDY GALPIN: I would do a whole\nbody exercises for almost all\nthat.\nI would do your full body parts.\nAnd I think you could\ncertainly finish that\nin 45 minutes of work time.\nA little bit of time to warm\nup, some down-regulation\nat the end.\nYou could be in and out\nof that gym in certainly\nunder 60 minutes.\nThe reality of it is you\ncould probably be out of there\nin under 50 minutes.\nThe total work time could be\n30, 35 once you get going.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's three days.\nAs you pointed out,\nprobably more work per week\nis going to be better\nin terms of maximizing\ngoals of aesthetic goals, and\nperformance-enhancing goals,\nand longevity goals.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean,\nthe numbers that I've heard\nis that we should all try\nto get somewhere between 150\nand probably more like 180\nto 200 minutes of zone two\ncardio per week minimum.\nBut as I recall, you\nconsider zone two cardio\nso low intensity\nthat just walking\naround qualifies as really\nzone one, zone two cardio.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nNot to take us\ntoo far off track.\nBut I think it's actually\nuseful to differentiate\nwhat I consider to be exercise\nand physical activity.\nSo physical activity\nis out for a walk.\nIt is using a walking\ntreadmill while you're at work.\nIt is parking farther\nin the parking lot\nand taking more steps.\nThese are all important.\nAnd what's clear, you are\nnot going to reach, likely,\noptimal health by only\nexercising hard and then\nsitting around the other 23\nand 1/2 hours of the day.\nSo it's very, very important.\nWhether you want to do that in\nthe form of zone one or zone\ntwo and hit 30 minutes a day.\nVarious organizations\nwill say things like that.\nYou need to have\n30 minutes a day\nof moderate to\nlow-intensity exercise.\nI don't really care.\nYou can combine it\nlike that if you want.\nWhat you don't want to do is\njust physical activity only,\nwhich is almost always\ngoing to be like zone one\nto maybe zone two.\nYou also don't want\nto go the other end\nof the spectrum, which is,\nagain, I lift hard three days\na week.\nAnd then what to do you\ndo the rest of the time?\nNothing.\nThat's not optimal either.\nAnd so, I guess the system\nI walked you through here--\nor the example, rather,\nI walked you through is--\nyou would need to\nmaybe supplant that\nwith being physically active.\nIf you work, say you're a\nnurse, and you're on your feet.\nYou're moving up and down.\nYou're probably\nactually covering\na decent amount of\nyour physical activity\nbecause you might be\nat 15,000 steps a day.\nIf you're sitting in\nfront of your computer\nand you do this same\nthree-day split,\nyou would probably\nneed to go out\nof your way to make sure you're\nadding a bunch more steps.\nAnd so, you might need\nto add several hours\nof walking to hit that\n150, 180 minutes a week\nof physical activity.\nBecause the program I laid out\nis, if you're doing, really,\n45 minutes three-days a\nweek, maybe 60 minutes,\nat best you've hit 180.\n60 minutes times\nthree, 180 a week.\nSo you might actually need\nto then throw in maybe\nsome more specific walks.\nSo you could do that\nin a number of ways.\nIt could be, again, actual\nstructured exercise.\nIt could be simply I'm going to\ndo a 10-minute walk three times\na day.\nIt could be the exercise\nsnacks that we talked about\nin a previous episode.\nSo there's lots\nof ways to engage\nin more physical activity.\nBut to me, those are\ndifferent, oftentimes,\nthan structured exercise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think many\npeople will appreciate that you\nput out there for us a\nthree-day-a-week protocol,\nbecause many people simply don't\nhave more time to exercise.\nThey're putting emphasis\non these other bins\nin the quadrant.\nAnd frankly, those other bins\nare very important as well.\nSo wonderful that\npeople can check off\nsome critical boxes\nfor aesthetics,\nand performance, and longevity\nwith three days of work\nor workouts, per\nweek, I should say.\nWhat are some other\nschedules that people\ncan follow if they're willing\nto dedicate a bit more time\ntoward their fitness?\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nIf you wanted to do\nanother sample of maybe\na four-day week.\nAnd again, to clarify this,\nI'm really happy you said that.\nThis is a four-day a week\nof structured exercise.\nThis would not account\nyour physical activity\nand moving around.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which\neverybody should be doing.\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nMaybe this is\nsomething like day one\nyou're going to do a\nstrength-training session,\nand you'll stay in the five\nto 10 or so repetition range.\nA little bit of strength, a\nlittle bit of hypertrophy,\nyou've checked off\na couple of boxes.\nProbably whole body, so\nthat you get all the body\nparts covered or close.\nWe're looking at generally\nmulti-joint exercises.\nCould be combination\nof barbells,\nfree-weights, bands,\nmachines, anything like that\nwould be day one.\nYou could come back\nthe very next day,\nor you could wait 24 hours.\nBut the second day\nof your exercise\nwould be maybe\nyour long duration.\nAnd this is actually sort of\nsimilar to how you set it up.\nIt's you do a little\nbit of the inverse.\nBut what you're\nkind of saying is,\nI'm probably going to be a\nlittle bit sore from day one.\nAnd I don't have any free\nbody parts that aren't sore.\nSo instead of trying to do\nanother lift or something,\nI'm just going to put in some\nrestorative longer duration\nstuff-- same exact\nprinciples for long duration\nwe just talked about.\nIt could be a swim.\nIt could be any\nnumber of things.\nCould be your sport.\nIt could be you're\nout, ride the bike\nand go for a jog in the sun,\nwhatever you would like to do.\nIf you're feeling better, maybe\nthat's a little harder longer.\nIf you're feeling pretty\nbeat up from the day before,\nmaybe that's a little\nbit shorter and slower.\nYou can modify it.\nThen maybe you take\nthe next day off.\nOr that's open.\nYour third day of\nexercise is now,\ninstead of being that five to 10\nrepetition range for your lift,\nyou do something like\n11 to 30 reps range.\nAlso, this could be\nexchanged for something\nmore like body weight,\nmore muscular endurance\ntype of stuff.\nSo this is a great\nday, maybe it's yoga.\nMaybe it is a gymnastics\nthing you're working on,\nor any of the many\nother styles of training\nthat are not quote\nunquote lifting weights.\nBut they're not just\nwalking and hiking.\nSo it could be a Pilates,\nor equivalent, anything\nlike this where\nyou're going to get\nsome muscular burn in there.\nBut it's probably not\nany additional weight\noutside of body\nweight, or if it is,\nit's fairly minimal, five, 10,\n15 pounds, something like that\nwould be nice.\nCould also be done in a circuit.\nSo we could hit\nour high heart rate\nand we could hit some\nmuscular endurance in there.\nGroup activity class\nmight be nice here.\nEven maybe something like a\nspin class or a dance class.\nAll these things could be great.\nAnd then, maybe you even\nfinish that with 10 minutes\nof some light weights to hit the\nbody part you say didn't get.\nSo maybe you did\nthe dance class.\nAnd then you finish and you do\n10 minutes of upper body sets\nof 30 to make sure you\nget a nice pump there,\nbecause your legs probably\ngot some work during the dance\nclass, but your\nupper body didn't.\nAnd so you balance the\nsystem out a little bit.\nSo all body parts got a little\nbit of muscular endurance.\nYour heart rate got really\nhigh, came back down,\nand you checked\nboth of those boxes.\nNow, it's important to remember\nthe hypertrophy episode.\nDoing sets of, say,\n15-plus repetitions per set\nis as effective as doing\nsets of five to 10 or 12\nfor hypertrophy--\ngaining muscle.\nIt's not effective though\nfor strength gains.\nSo you wouldn't want\nto do this only,\nbecause you'd really be doing\nnothing to improve your muscle\nstrength.\nAnd you want to make\nsure that that box is\nticked at least a little bit.\nThen, again, you could take\nthe day off after this.\nOr you could roll right\ninto your fourth exercise\nday, which would be your last\nexercise session of the week.\nAnd you would do something\nmore of a medium intensity.\nSo this is a little bit higher\nintensity than our second day.\nAnd this could be something\nlike shadowboxing,\nor hitting a heavy bag.\nIt could be a little bit of\nhigher intensity intervals,\nbut not all the way up.\nSo maybe this is you're\ngoing to do a one minute on,\none minute off on the bike.\nBut you're only going to\ngo to 85%, 90% heart rate.\nAnd then, instead of going\noff during that one minute,\nyou drop it down to 50%.\nSo we would actually look like\n30 minutes of straight work,\nbut you would have a little\nbit of rolling intensity\nas opposed to staying\nreally nice and restorative.\nIt's going to be\nsome work there.\nAnd you would finish it\nwith something like five\nto six minutes total of\nmax heart rate stuff.\nWhich lines up perfectly\nwith that number you actually\n[LAUGHS] created on\nour endurance episode\nof hitting six minutes total\nper week of maximum heart rate\nor close.\nSo you could wrap that\nall up into one session.\nYou could do those\nin the inverse order,\nthorough warm-up, a few\nminutes, whether you\nwant to do 30-second\nbursts or a minute burst,\nor straight five minutes.\nThis is a protocol I like to\nuse a ton on the assault bike.\nIt is simply a good warm-up,\n10 minutes solid warm-up.\nRecover, and then I'm\ngoing to go five minutes\nand cover as much distance\nas I can in five minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Brutal.\nANDY GALPIN: It is brutal.\nAnd it's amazing.\nAnd you get a lot\ndone in five minutes.\n10 minutes on the back\nof that is a very gradual\nbring back to Earth there.\nI actually, in\nthat case, I don't\nneed to do\ndown-regulation breathing,\nbecause I've spent 10 minutes\nactually coming way back down.\nAnd the last two minutes or\nso of that is very deliberate,\nfive-second inhale through\nthe nose, five-second exhale\nthrough the nose while\nI'm barely just moving.\nAnd you end up being\nin a pretty good spot.\nSo that, again, time-wise could\neasily be done in 30 minutes.\nAnd you'd be rounded off there.\nSo the nice part about\nthis four day a week split\nas well as a three\nday a week split is it\ndoes give you a little\nbit of flexibility.\nAnd so, what I mean\nis, maybe Monday\nyour plan is to do\nthe day one lift.\nAnd then, any number of\nthings popped up in life.\nJust shift it back to Tuesday.\nRather than saying Monday is leg\nday and then all of a sudden,\nsomething happened,\nyou miss leg day.\nIt's just you're doing\nthese things in order.\nAnd you would like to get all\nfour done in a seven-day span.\nBut if it doesn't happen, fine.\nThe next day you\nget to work out,\nyou just go right back\ninto the next workout.\nAnd it doesn't matter what\nday they land on exactly.\nFor the three-day routine,\nthat works very nice,\nbecause the assumption\nthere is you\nreally only have time for\nthree workouts a week.\nAnd so, that's\nsort of implicit is\nthere's probably\nsome chaos happening\nin the schedule a little bit.\nAnd you don't really\nhave the ability\nto lock in three days per week.\nIf that's not the\ncase, you can go.\nBut we're trying to\nlisten to the pain points\nthat people have with exercise\nand see if we can give them\nsome solutions for those.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Several\nthings about this program\nare attractive to me.\nOne of them you just\nmentioned, which\nis that by not rigidly\nattaching individual workouts\nto specific days of the week,\none, in theory, could say,\nOK, it was--\nI didn't get that\nmuch sleep last night.\nI don't feel--\nI know that a lot of\npeople say, what is feel?\nBut I don't feel\nrecovered, or like I'm\ngoing to get that much out\nof the workout tomorrow.\nSo I'm-- or today-- so I'm just\ngoing to push it forward a day.\nAnd the ability to slide\nworkouts forward or back\nby day I think is incredibly\nvaluable for the consistency's\nsake.\nI also really like this idea of\nsome of the long duration work\ncoming a day after\nhitting the strength\nand a bit of hypertrophy work.\nSo this would be the day two.\nOne thing that I've\nexperienced over and over\nis that if I'm very sore in a\ngiven muscle group, especially\nmy legs, doing\nsome low intensity\ncardio, whether or not\nit's a jog, or on the bike,\ntypically for me it's a\njog, or even skipping rope\nand walking does seem to\ndissipate the soreness.\nI'm sure there's a\nmechanism-- there\nhas to-- there's a mechanism\nfor everything, frankly.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I\nlike that arrangement.\nAnd then, I also like\nthis idea of making sure\nthat there's a workout\nfor muscular endurance.\nBecause I feel like unless I've\nbeen stuck without a good gym,\nor I've decided to\nspecifically train\nbodyweight exercise, which\nI did a few years ago,\nI got really excited about some\nof Pavel Tsatsouline's work.\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nGreat stuff.\nYeah.\nAmazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He has a\nbook, The Naked Warrior,\nwhich doesn't involve training\nnaked, although I suppose\nyou could if you wanted.\nBut it was really\nabout no weights.\nAnd involved building\nup to pistol squats\nand one-arm push-ups,\nand things of that sort,\neven doing pull-ups on doors.\nAnd I discovered that some\ndoor frames are much stronger\nthan others in hotels.\n[LAUGHTER]\nI just accidentally\ncaused some damage there.\nBut in any case, muscular\nendurance, I think,\nis a really\ninteresting one that I\nplan to incorporate\ninto my schedule.\nBut that is, I think, is\none that's often overlooked,\nunless people really\nhave an aversion\nto weights and to machines.\nANDY GALPIN: You're right.\nAnd it shouldn't be.\nBecause it's pretty\nlow-hanging fruit.\nYou don't need a lot of\nequipment for it typically.\nIt doesn't hurt that bad.\nYou don't often get\nthat sore out of it.\nAnd you're going to feel a\nnice wonderful pump afterwards.\nSo it's great.\nAnd as we discussed\nmany times now,\nit is quite effective\nat hypertrophy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nI also-- I don't know\nif they fit specifically\nwith muscular endurance.\nBut if you look at the\nphysiques, for example,\non rock climbers, I\nmean, they have-- to me,\nof course they have--\nusually the experienced climbers\nhave pretty remarkable body\ncompositions.\nThey tend to be lean,\nand lithe, and flexible,\nall those things that\nmany people aspire to.\nBut the other thing is,\ntheir development always\nlooks exceedingly balanced.\nYou don't really\ntend to see climbers\nthat are overdeveloped\nin the torso\nand underdeveloped in the arms,\nor overdeveloped in the arms\ndespite all the climbing and\nunderdeveloped relatively\nin the other limb movement.\nAnd that's true\nfor women and men.\nIt's not a sport that\nI participate in.\nBut it seems like what\nthey're doing is essentially\nmuscular endurance training.\nANDY GALPIN: Basically.\nYeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nSo there's really something\nthere to be valued.\nSo that's a four-day a week\nschedule with off days or rest\ndays inserted as needed.\nAnd then just-- and continuing.\nFor those that are a bit more\ncommitted to their fitness\nand want to do a five or\nsix-day a week program,\nwould you recommend\njust collapsing\nsome of the off days, paying\nmore attention to recovery,\nand cycling through\nmore quickly?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, absolutely.\nYou could combine that\nand just run that--\neither one of those programs.\nSo you could run that three-day\nweek program back to back.\nDo it, get that\ndone in six days.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ah.\nSo day one, speed,\npower, hypertrophy.\nDay two, strength, work\nwith elevated heart rate,\nanaerobic capacity.\nAnd day three endurance.\nAnd then just-- and then\njust cycle through again.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nYou take day four\noff of the week.\nAnd then you go back again.\nSo we would be having six\ndays of exercise, one day off.\nAnd you'd be getting every\none of those adaptations\nin multiple times a week.\nThat is almost exactly how I\nwould set up a six-day-a-week\nprogram.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great I love\nthe elegance and the simplicity\nof that and the\nthoroughness of it,\nbecause it checks off so\nmany, if not all of the nine\nmajor adaptations to\nexercise that we've been\ntalking about these episodes.\nAnd I suppose the one thing that\nI want to highlight and pose\nthis also as a question is\nthat early in our discussions,\nin a previous episode,\nyou mentioned that so much\nof what people think of\nand apply as it relates\nto resistance\ntraining is borrowed\nfrom bodybuilding\nand hypertrophy\ntraining specifically.\nWhich typically involves getting\nclose to failure or failures,\nsometimes even involving rest\npause, where you hit failure,\nthen set the weight\ndown for a few sections\nand repeat these high\nintensity techniques,\naccentuating the negative,\nso-called the centric,\net cetera.\nIn hearing about these\nprotocols of three-day-a-week,\nor four-day-a-week,\nsix-day-a-week,\nit's very clear to me that if\none is not careful to omit that\nkind of thinking, and suddenly\nis taking their strength work\nand speed to failure, or is\npushing too hard on muscular\nendurance to the point where\nyou're just grinding out that\nvery last push-up on every set,\nthat the amount of soreness\nand the amount of recovery that\nresults from these workouts\nmight start to cause\nprogress issues.\nSo one thing that's\nin the back of my mind\nis, as you've described\nthese programs is,\nthat even though some\nof them are very brief\nor involve a minimum\nof time commitment,\nin particular a three-day week\nbut also the four-day week\nschedule, that there is\na discipline involved\nin making sure that you\nstick to the workout\nthat you're supposed\nto do that day.\nAnd not go ham, as\nthey say, and just\nthrow in a couple of extra\nsets of bicep curls and tricep\npushes, because you\nwant to do that and you\nthought you could maybe you\ncould get away with that.\nBut you have to come back\npretty quickly and do\nsome serious, meaning devoted,\nspeed and power work and/or\nstrength work.\nAnd if you haven't\nbeen disciplined\nabout not doing certain\nforms of exercise,\nI could see how the whole\nthing could crash quickly,\nand one could think, oh,\nthis is just too much work,\nor it's not for me.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo this, I suppose,\nis now where the\nquestion comes, which\nis, what are some\nof the key points\nthat people need to keep in mind\nwhen they embrace a program?\nHow rigidly do they\nneed to stay attached\nto today's endurance day.\nI'm just doing endurance.\nToday's strength day.\nI'm just doing strength work.\nI'm not going to take\nthings to absolute failure\nor beyond failure.\nANDY GALPIN: I am\nabsolutely happy with anyone\nmodifying any of\nthe sample programs\nhowever they would like to.\nMy only recommendation for\nthe question you just posed\nwould be set your program.\nAnd then, if you're going\nto make a change, fine.\nBut that is a change\nto your program.\nIn other words, don't just\nmake decisions every single day\nand make changes.\nIf you're doing that, you might\nas well not have a program.\nAnd as we described\nearlier, there\nis clear evidence that\nhaving a program is\nbetter than not, regardless\nof the effectiveness\nof the program.\nAnd so, my general comment\nto that is, OK, fine,\na day or two, you made\nsome modifications.\nNo problem.\nWe're in a situation now\nwhere you're basically\nchanging the workout\nevery day as you go,\nthen we just need to\nwrite a new program.\nWe need to reassess\nwhere we're at.\nBecause we need to\nhave some structure.\nLook, the reality of it is,\nI change the programming\nI'm going to do the\nday of often because\nof any number of situations.\nI just don't feel like it.\nI way overestimated today.\nWe talked a little bit\nin the previous episode\nabout autoregulation, which\nis a style of periodization\nand program design in which\nyou're adjusting based\non how you're actually\nfeeling that day,\nbut with some\nspecific structures.\nSo you're going to take\nsome measurements that day\nand adjust.\nSo autoregulation is a\nvery, very effective tool.\nYou just need to make\nsure that auto is dialed.\nIn other words, is it\nbecause your body actually\nneeded something different?\nOr is it because you're now\njust getting a little bit lazy?\nNow you're just not\nfeeling like it today.\nSo there's a little bit of an\nimpossible line to draw there.\nBoth scenarios are real--\ngray area-- a lot is\nreal in the moment.\nAnd so, you just need\nto be a little bit\naware of having some reality\ncheck, listening to your body,\nbut then also being like,\nhey, no, I'm talking to you.\nI'm telling you\nthis is the plan.\nWe're going to do this.\nAnd staying within it.\nIt is going to be\nchallenging to progressively\noverload and therefore get a\nhigher likelihood of success\nat your training\nprogram if you're just\nmaking decisions and changing\nthe program right before you\nwork out.\nYou're probably\nnot-- you're probably\ngoing-- for most\npeople, you're probably\ngoing to choose less or off\nmore so than you choose more.\nNow, having said that, there\nare more than a few clients\nthat have come\nthrough our programs\nwhere they choose more always.\nThey add a set.\nThey add an exercise.\nThey add in another workout.\nAnd that can be OK.\nBut we're going to track\nvarious markers on them.\nAnd if we see these things\nconsistently going down,\nwe're going to\nidentify whether they\nare-- which phase of this\novertraining thing we'll\ntalk about next\nthey're actually in.\nSome phases I'm OK.\nSome of them I'm not.\nIf we're seeing certain\nthings happen physiologically,\nwe're going to make\na conversation.\nWe're also then going to really\nthink carefully about why\nare you making this choice?\nDo you feel like the\ntraining isn't enough?\nOK, great.\nLet's modify it then.\nAre you not making progress?\nOr are there some other\nreasons why you're doing this?\nObviously, I'm not a\npsychologist or therapist.\nBut there are clearly situations\nin which folks dose themselves\nwith far too much exercise\nfor reasons that are not\nbecause it's productive to\ntheir training or goals.\nAnd if such a case,\nwe would probably\nbring in somebody that\nspecializes in those areas\nto clear that out and\njust make sure it's like,\nwe're not doing this for\nanxiety issues or energy things.\nIf it's, I just don't think the\nprogram's enough, OK, great.\nLet's go back.\nLet's look at our metrics.\nLet's evaluate our\ntests and go there.\nBut if there's other\nreasons, then we\nmay bring in somebody to\nhave that conversation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nUsually when I've seen\npeople deviate from programs,\nit's because they tend to\nrevert to something that they've\ndone for a long time.\nIt just feels really\ncomfortable to them.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it worked.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And it was\ngiving them decent results.\nSo they're skeptical\nto try something else.\nOr there is a phenotype\nof haphazardness\nsometimes, especially\nif people get\nreally caffeinated\nbefore a workout\nand just want to\nthrow something in.\nAnd then, there's\na third category.\nAnd this is one that\nI've had to contend\nwith a lot in my life, which\nis that I really enjoy training\nwith other people when\nI have the opportunity.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd a certain day\nrolls around where\nyou're supposed\nto do something and not do\nother things and people say,\nhey, do you want to go\nfor a long ocean swim?\nOr you want to train?\nAnd you end up doing some\nKenny Kane, this one's for you,\nsome ridiculous 20 wall\nball CrossFit type workout.\nAnd I'm not acclimated\nfor that sort of thing.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd then it does\ntend to throw things\noff, not because--\nno pun intended, Kenny-- because\nthere's nothing wrong with a 20\nsets of wall balls if\nyou're-- that's part\nof your conditioning.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But if it's\nnot appropriate for where\nyou are in your\nschedule, it really\ncan disrupt what\nyou're trying to do.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Even as\na non-competitive athlete,\nlike myself, years\nsince I've competed\nin any athletic program.\nBut as a\nnon-competitive athlete,\nI think there's a beauty to\nand a really strong incentive\nto being disciplined about\nthe program that one follows.\nAs a mentor and professor that\nI worked with years ago used\nto say, I'd come\ninto his office,\nall these ideas and\nthings I want to do.\nAnd he'd say, let's\nconstrain this walk.\nAnd then the question\nyou always want\nto arrive at in a discussion\nwith your students,\nas you know is, what's\nthe experiment exactly?\nAnd then you go and you do\nthat specific experiment.\nI think I view a\nworkout the same way,\nthat there are multiple\nadaptations, goals,\nand things that people\nare trying to achieve.\nReally knowing why\nyou're there each time\nand really sticking to\nthat, even if it means\nnot training with other people.\nOr I always say, well,\nyou can train with me,\nbut I'm not going\nto train with you.\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDY GALPIN: Selfish.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's one way to do it.\nBut really sticking\nto a schedule\nis really what allows\nthe progress to emerge.\nBut that doesn't necessarily\nmean being antisocial.\nYou can invite people along.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut in this case,\nI'm telling people to be\nthe host, not the guest.\nANDY GALPIN: I have a\nlittle bit of a rule here.\nMaybe I should have answered\nyour question this way.\nI actually like doing things\ntotally different occasionally.\nSo I'll do-- when I'm traveling,\nI tend to do hotel workouts.\nWhat I mean by that is, I will\ngo down to the workout room.\nAnd I will do a set of 10 to\n15 reps of every single machine\nin the exact order in\nwhich they are laid out.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Whoa.\nANDY GALPIN: Just\nfor the sake of fun.\nJust for the sake of, OK.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's like the\ntarot card version of workouts.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, totally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nlike, whatever comes up,\nI'm going to make sense of it.\nANDY GALPIN: And you just move.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nANDY GALPIN: And\nthose are typically\nthings of like, I just want to\nmove a little bit for jet lag\nand other purposes.\nThat's often, I wasn't going\nto get to work out today.\nAnd so, now I'm going to\ndo something to feel great.\nI don't travel\nthat much, though,\nso it's not really\nthrowing my things off.\nI also, I don't get\na lot of free time.\nAnd so, if I am\ntraveling, and I'm\nseeing someone I haven't\nseen in many years\nor, for the first\ntime, I mean, we\ngot to train together this\nweek for the first time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nwas a lot of fun.\nANDY GALPIN: I'm not going\nto burn that opportunity.\nMy rule is this though.\nI'm not going to\ndo something that's\ngoing to cost me\nmore than three days.\nSo I'm absolutely\nhappy to get out there,\nand maybe tomorrow\nmorning, or tonight, we\ngo do something fun\nthat's off my schedule.\nI'm in.\nI'm in 100%.\nI'm just going to\ndown-regulate a little bit.\nI'm not going to maybe do\nas much as you or as hard\nas you or whatever.\nI'll do more than I should.\nBut if it costs me tomorrow,\nit was worth the exchange.\nI don't have a world record\nI'm setting anytime soon.\nI don't have--\nI got many years.\nI'm happy to give up a\ncouple of days of exercise\nto be a little sorer\nthan I need to be\nfor the exchange of\na lifetime memory.\nAnd this stuff is\nso important to me.\nThis stuff lands as\ntrue lifetime memories.\nI can look back-- many\nof my fond memories\nfrom my life are training\nsessions with friends, whatever\nit is, like doing\njujitsu with somebody\nwho's a world champion.\nYou're just like, whatever\nthe thing is, you're like,\nthat was really, really cool.\nAbsolutely worth\nmissing two days.\nIf it's going to be more than\nthree days though, where I'm\ngoing to be so wrecked I can't\nwork out for five or six days,\nthen I'm probably like, all\nright, that's kind of nonsense.\nUnless it's just an\nopportunity where I'm like,\nI absolutely can't pass that up.\nSo that's how I think about it.\nThat doesn't happen too often\nwith me though, maybe once\na month.\nAnd so I'm like, OK,\nfine, I lost a day.\nReality of it is it's probably\nmore like once a quarter\nthat that happens.\nSo I don't really care.\nSo you do want to\nbalance joy and life.\nYou don't want to be so rigid\nabout your training program\nthat it ruins and robs\nthose experiences.\nPhysical activity should be fun.\nYour fitness and\nyour training should\nbe something that\nmakes your life better,\nnot some task you\nhave to get done\nso that 75 years\nfrom now you've hit\nsome metric of who knows what.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just alone in\nyour room with your training\nlogs.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\n[LAUGHTER]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No,\nin all seriousness,\nI think, you point to\nthe richness of life.\nAnd you can draw these boxes\nlike work, relationships,\nfitness, recovery.\nBut the boundaries between those\nboxes are blurry, because--\nANDY GALPIN: Of course.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I should say,\nI love training with people.\nI greatly enjoyed training\nwith you this morning,\nnot just because I was\nreceiving so many useful tips.\nIn fact, thank you.\nFirst time I PR'd in a\nnumber of things today.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Thanks to\nyour input in the moment.\nAnd that's an\nirreplaceable kind of gift.\nBut mostly, it's the\ngift of getting to train\nwith a colleague and friend.\nSo I want to underscore,\nhighlight, and put\nan exclamation mark\nbehind what you just said.\nThank you once again,\nand again, for giving us\nso much interesting,\nclear, actionable,\nand at times somewhat\ncounterintuitive information\nin order to build out\nan exceptional training\nprogram to meet any of-- and\nin some cases-- all of the nine\nmajor adaptations that\nexercise can create\ntoward aesthetic,\nperformance-related, and\nhealthspan lifespan,\naka longevity goals.\nIt's really a treasure\ntrove of information there.\nAnd I look forward to\nour next discussion\nabout how to best\nrecover from exercise,\nboth within the exercise bout,\nand between exercise bouts,\nand in the more macroscopic\nstructure of a week, a month,\na year.\nI can't wait.\nANDY GALPIN: I\ncan't wait either.\nI love that topic.\nAnd I've got a lot to\ncover, so it'll be fun.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If you're\nlearning from and/or\nenjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe\nto our YouTube
