    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we are\ndiscussing headaches headaches are\nsomething that everybody will suffer at\nsome point in their lifetime of course\nsome people suffer from headaches far\nmore often than others and for many\npeople headaches can be incredibly\ndebilitating limiting their ability to\nwork to socialize to sleep to exercise\nessentially to live life in any kind of\nnormal way as we'll soon discuss there\nare many different kinds of headache we\nhave migraine headaches tension\nheadaches cluster headaches today I will\nreview all the different types of\nheadaches and what the underlying\nbiology of each and every one of those\ntypes of headaches is as well as\nfortunately the many excellent\ntreatments that exist for the different\ntypes of headache in fact what we'll\nsoon discuss is that by understanding\nwhich type of headache you have and a\nlittle bit about the underlying biology\nof each different type of headache it\nbecomes quite straightforward to select\nthe best treatment options for you to\nfor instance provide relief from\nfrequent and recurring tension headaches\ncluster headaches even sinus headaches\nthe sorts of headaches that are\nassociated with sinus infections and\ncolds where the sinuses get clogged up\nand you experience headache so while\ntoday's episode focuses on all aspects\nand types of headaches it will have\ntremendous relevance for everybody so\nfor those of you that experience\nheadache every once in a while where\nonly when you're sick or have a sinus\nheadache or for those of you that suffer\nfrom debilitating migraines today's\nconversation actually has a bit of\noptimism woven into it meaning there are\nexcellent treatments for each and every\none of the different types of headaches\nand I was quite impressed and excited to\nlearn when researching this episode that\nthe treatments for headache range from\nof course prescription drug treatments\nand over-the-counter medications of the\nsort of type that most of us have heard\nabout ibuprofen acetaminophen and so\nforth so-called anti-inflammatory drugs\nbut it turns out there are many natural\ntreatments for headaches that when\ncompared to those over-the-counter drugs\nand even some prescription drugs appear\nto be easily as effective and in many\ncases more effective than the typical\ndrug treatments many of which can carry\nside effects that is the drug treatments\ncarry side effects whereas the natural\ntreatments appear to not carry side\neffects now of course anytime we have a\ndiscussion about natural treatments\nthere are likely to be some eye rolls\nout there and people thinking oh you\nknow this is going to be a bunch of woo\nscience well far from it as you'll soon\nlearn today each and every one of the\ntreatments for each and every one of the\ndifferent kinds of headaches is grounded\nin solid biological understanding of why\nthat particular treatment ought to work\nand does work so for instance you'll\nlearn that some headache arises because\nof muscular pain other headache arises\nbecause of excessive vasodilation the\narteries and blood vessels get bigger\nand wider and so there's a pressure and\na swelling within the cranium that\npeople experience as a headache and it\nturns out that many of the more natural\ntreatments out there can address either\nthe muscular pain issue or the\nvasodilation issue or other issues and\nunderlying mechanisms for headache so\nagain while headaches are very intrusive\nirritating and in some cases\ndebilitating there is certainly light at\nthe end of this tunnel meaning by the\nend of today's episode each and every\none of you will have an array of\nexcellent treatment options that you can\nchoose from in order to address and\nprovide relief from any of the different\ntypes of headache before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is thesis\nthesis makes custom nootropics and as\nmany of you know I'm not a fan of the\nword nootropics because nootropics means\nsmart drugs and as a neuroscientist I\ncan tell you there is no neural circuit\nin the brain for being smart thesis\nunderstands this and has designed\ndifferent nootropics in order to bring\nyour brain into specific States for\nspecific types of work so for instance\nfor Creative work or to engage with more\nFocus or to give you more energy for\ncognitive or physical work so with\nthesis they'll design custom nootropics\nfor you that will allow you more focus\nbetter task switching more creativity\nand so on and they'll be sure to include\nonly the ingredients that you want and\nnot the ingredients that you don't I've\nbeen using thesis for more than a year\nnow and I can confidently say that their\nneutropics have been a total game\nchanger for me I like the clarity\nformula prior to Long bouts of cognitive\nwork or the Energy Formula prior to\nphysical workouts if you'd like to try\nyour own personalized nootropic starter\nkit go online to takethesis.com huberman\nyou'll take a brief three-minute quiz\nand thesis will send you four different\nformulas to try on your first month\nagain that's takethesis.com huberman and\nuse the code Huber minute checkout for\n10 off your first box today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by element element is\nan electrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans the exact ratios of electrolytes\nare an element and those are sodium\nmagnesium and potassium but it has no\nsugar I've talked many times before on\nthis podcast about the key role of\nhydration and electrolytes for nerve\ncell function neuron function as well as\nthe function of all the cells and all\nthe tissues and organ systems of the\nbody\nif we have sodium magnesium and\npotassium present in the proper ratios\nall of those cells function properly and\nall our bodily systems can be optimized\nif the electrolytes are not present and\nif hydration is low we simply can't\nthink as well as we would otherwise our\nmood is off hormone systems go off our\nability to get into physical action to\nengage in endurance and strength and all\nsorts of other things is diminished so\nwith element you can make sure that\nyou're staying on top

is the most nutrient\ndense and delicious red meat available\nMaui Nui spent nearly a decade building\na USDA certified wild harvesting system\nto help balance invasive deer\npopulations on the island of Maui I've\ntalked before more on this podcast and\nwe've had guests on this podcast that\nhave emphasized the critical role of\ngetting quality protein not just for\nmuscle repair and protein synthesis but\nalso for repair of all tissues including\nbrain tissue on a day-to-day basis and\nthe general rule of thumb for that is\none gram of quality protein per pound of\nbody weight per day with Maui Nui meats\nyou can accomplish that very easily and\nyou can do that without ingesting in\nexcess of calories which is also\ncritical for immediate and long-term\nhealth I should say that Maui Nui meats\nare not only extremely high quality but\nthey are also delicious I particularly\nlike they're jerky so they're venison\njerky I also have had Maui Nui venison\nin various recipes including ground\nvenison some venison steaks and I love\nthe taste of the venison it's lean but\nit doesn't taste overly lean or dry at\nall it's incredibly delicious so if\nyou'd like to try Maui Nui venison go to\nmauinuyvenison.com huberman to get 20\noff your first order again that's Maui\nNews venison.com\nto get 20 off your first order the\nhuberman Lab podcast is now partnered\nwith momentous supplements to find the\nsupplements we discuss on the huberman\nLab podcast you can go to live momentous\nspelled ous live momentous.com huberman\nand I should just mention that the\nlibrary of those supplements is\nconstantly expanding again that's\nlivemomentis.com huberman let's talk\nabout headaches and as we are soon going\nto learn there are different types of\nheadaches and different types of\nheadaches arise from changes in\ndifferent types of tissues in the head\narea and indeed in the neck area as well\nnow one of the key things to understand\nis that if you want relief from a\nheadache you need to understand which\ntissue is mainly involved in creating\nthat type of headache so for instance\nmany people suffer from what are called\ntension headaches now tension headaches\nare a little bit of a misnomer because\nmany people might think oh tension I'm\nunder a lot of tension and stress and\ntherefore I get tension headaches and\nindeed stress can cause tension\nheadaches but tension headaches are\nreally the sort of headache that you\nfeel around the top part of the head not\nthe very top but sort of where you would\nput a headband so above the eyes and\naround the head it doesn't have to be\nexperienced all the way around the head\nbut the main underlying reason that is\nthe tissue system that mainly underlies\ntension headaches is the muscular system\nthere are a lot of muscles on the skull\nBelieve It or Not of course on the neck\nand they allow you to move your neck and\nhead\nthere are a lot of muscles that lie\nparallel to the skull and oftentimes\nthose muscles will undergo excessive\namounts of constriction\nnow there are of course muscles and the\njaw that can also lead to headache and\njaw ache and things of that sort and\nneck aches and headaches so what we're\nreally pointing out here is that the\nmuscles are a key player in the\nformation of different types of headache\nTension Headache in particular but of\ncourse muscles and muscle tension can be\nevolved in the other types of headaches\nas well okay so I just want to highlight\nmuscular issues as one particular source\nof the ache in headaches the other\ntissue that can be prominently involved\nin generating the ache of a headache or\nthe so-called meninges now the meninges\nin addition to being a fun word to say\nor a bunch of tissues that line the\noutside of the brain and reside between\nthe brain and the skull so you might\nthink okay between the brain and the\nskull there's probably just a little bit\nof fluid and the brain is right up next\nto the skull but it turns out that's not\nthe case the brain is actually encased\nin a very thick very durable Sac or\ncasing that's wrapped around it tight\nlike Saran wrap it actually has a name\nwhich is dura d-u-r-a and so you can\nremember Dura durable and having done\nsome surgeries many surgeries before on\nbrains of different types ranging from\nHuman even though I'm not a neurosurgeon\nas a clinician ranging from Human to\nother types of species what you find is\nthat the dura is exceedingly durable\ngetting through this thing really\nrequires an a very sharp razor blade so\nthe brain is actually sitting in a very\nfibrous like Sac that you simply could\nnot open up with your fingertips under\nany conditions it's really durable the\nmeninges are in that general area and\nalso encasing the brain and the meninges\nprovide an additional buffer between the\nbrain and the dura and the skull so\nagain you don't want to think about the\nbrain as just sitting right next to the\nskull it's close by but there are a\nbunch of other thin fibrous tissues many\nof which are very thin and fragile and\nothers of which such as the dura that\nare very very strong because they're\nvery fibrous almost like a uh if you've\never felt for instance the sale of a of\na sailboat you might think oh it's just\nthis big flapping sheet in the wind it\nis anything but a sheet in the Wind it\nis a very very strong and durable\nmaterial now the proximity of the dura\nand the meninges to the brain and the\nfact that everything is wrapped very\ntightly together and the fact that\nthere's a lot of vasculature so that\nwould be arteries blood vessels and\ncapillaries are all in that area on the\ntop of the brain and throughout the\nbrain the fact that all of that is in\nvery close proximity and wrapped really\ntight in this very durable sac\nis one of the reasons why when blood\nvessels or arteries or both become\ndilated they open there creates a\npressure between the brain and those\ntissues and because there isn't much\ndistance between the tissues like the\ndura and the meninges and the skull\nthere's also pressure that allows for\nthe brain to literally sneak up or I\nshould say give the impression that your\nbrain is expanding up against your skull\nso the point here is that while muscular\ntension can give rise to headache the\nother thing that can give rise to\nheadache is so-called vasodilation the\nexpansion or the widening of the\narteries blood vessels and capillaries\nand one of the reasons why that gives\nrise to headache is because there's\nsimply not a lot of space for that\nexpansion to go it doesn't allow\nanything except for the brain to push up\nagainst that very durable tissue and\nthat very durable tissue to push up\nagainst the skull and even though the\nbrain itself doesn't have pain receptors\nthat's right the brain itself doesn't\nhave pain receptors that is why a\nneurosurgeon can take off a piece of\nskull and can probe around in the brain\nwith an electrode and the person is\ncompletely unaware and in order to get\nthrough the skull of course that little\nskin flap has to remove be removed from\nthe skull and that requires a little bit\nof topical anesthetic but really you\ndon't need any anesthetic to go into the\nbrain itself because there aren't pain\nreceptors on the brain itself however\nthe tissues surrounding the brain such\nas the dura the meninges and the\nvasculature that then reaches up believe\nit or not into the skull the vasculature\ndoesn't actually stop right beneath the\nskull it actually blood vessels it get\ninto the skull and they're actually\nportals by which blood can move within\nthe skull itself well what that means is\nthat since all of the tissues are very\nclose by and very compact\nwith respect to one another any increase\nin the size of the portals that allow\nmovement of blood there\nand the fact that there are what are\ncalled nociceptors noci nociceptors\nThese are essentially pain receptors\nbecause of the presence of pain\nreceptors in the tissues around the\nbrain\nwhen there's an increase in the size of\nthose vascular portals the arteries\ncapillaries and vessels\nwe experience that as intense pain and\npressure and fortunately there are\nexcellent treatments for dealing with\nthat intense pain and pressure but keep\nin mind that the intense pain and\npressure that is the consequence of\nvasodilation that is the widening of\nthese different vascular portals\nis very different than the type of pain\nthat arises from muscular tension as is\nthe case with Tension Headache okay so\nnow we have two sources of pain that is\nthe ache in headache and there are two\nmore that we need to think about in\ntrying to better understand the\ndifferent types of headaches that we'll\ndiscuss and in terms of trying to\nunderstand which are going to be the\nbest treatments for the different types\nof headaches and those are neural and\ninflammatory responses so let's talk\nabout the neural type first there is a\ntype of headache that many people\nunfortunately suffer from we'll get into\nthis in a bunch more detail in a moment\nbut those are called cluster headaches\ncluster headaches are headaches that\narise not from the surface people don't\nexperience them as kind of a tightening\nof the forehead and the neck and the jaw\nbut rather it feels as if the headache\nis coming from deep within the head and\nin particular from behind the orbit of\none or the other eyes and sometimes both\neyes for those of you that have ever\nexperienced cluster headaches they are\nextremely painful even the more where I\nshould say the relatively more minor\ncluster headaches are extremely painful\nand the severe ones are exceedingly\npainful\ncluster headaches arise from Deep where\nthis we get the Sensation that they are\nrising from deep within our head as\nopposed from the surface inward because\nthey are neural in origin and there's a\nparticular nerve pathway called the\ntrigeminal nerve that often is the\norigin of these cluster headaches that\npeople experience behind the eye the\ntrigeminal as the name suggests has\nthree branches try Okay so there's a\nbranch that essentially extends to the\neye there's also a branch that extends\nto the mandible right to the uh to the\nlip and there's a branch that extends\nmore or less to the to the nasal area\nand so this trigeminal nerve becomes\ninflamed or in other ways is hyper\nactivated in some cases and that causes\nthe Deep pain below the eye because it\nis that first branch of the trigeminal\nnerve which is the ophthalmic branch\nwhich tends to be activated first so\npeople start feeling as if there's a\npain behind their eye in particular on\none side oftentimes there's lacrimation\nwhich is tearing up there can be some\nnasal discharge another common symptom\nof this type of headache that is the\ncluster headache is that the pupil\nsometimes will become very small the\npupils of the eyes and they won't dilate\neven in darkness so there are a bunch of\nthings that are going on on one or both\nsides of the face that seem to arise\nfrom deep within the head or it's almost\nas if it's coming from the brain outward\nand that's because it's neural in origin\nOkay so we've got muscular origins of\nheadaches we've got meningeal\norigins of headaches that is the the\nstuff around the brain and as it relates\nto the vasculature and we have neural\norigins of headaches and of course\nthere's inflammation origins of\nheadaches now inflammation is a term\nthat gets thrown around a lot these days\npeople are talking about you know this\nreduces inflammation inflammation is bad\nand and I I suppose in some cases and\nwhen inflammation is really widespread\nacross the brainer body it's bad but I\ndon't think any of us should think about\ninflammation per se as bad what I mean\nis inflammation is just one form of\nsignaling in the body which of course\nincludes the brain\ninflammation of a tissue is one way in\nwhich a set of cells so these could be\nfor instance uh cells of the immune\nsystem and we cover this in a detailed\nepisode all about the immune system if\nyou'd like to check that out you go to\nhubermanlab.com just put into our search\nfunction immune system and you can find\nthat episode by the way all of our\nepisodes are searchable by keyword\nhubermanlab.com and it'll take you to\nspecific episodes and time stamps for\nthe topics you're interested in so for\nsake of this discussion about headache\ninflammation is going to be the case\nwhen one particular tissue in and around\nthe head area is releasing molecules\ncytokines which sometimes are called\ninflammatory cytokines but there are\nalso non-inflammatory or\nanti-inflammatory cytokines but\ninflammatory molecules that are\nsignaling to the rest of the body hey\nthere's something going on here there's\neither some intrusive object and indeed\nif you were to get you know a bb or a\nsplinter into a particular uh you know\nskin area there'd be a lot of\ninflammation so it could be the\nintroduction of a foreign physical\nobject into an area that will cause\ninflammation it can be the presence of\nsome sort of local toxin in that area it\ncould be a more systemic inflammation\nnonetheless inflammation in the neck and\nhead area where frankly anywhere within\nthe sinus area so this would include the\nmouth the nose around the eyes because\nthe sinuses many of us think of sinuses\nas just our nose but actually if I were\nto show you a skull a human skull or any\nother kind of skull\nyou'd be very hopefully intrigued to\nlearn that the skull is just not one big\npiece of solid bone or a you know a top\nwith a jaw below it it actually has all\nthese small what are called\nfenestrations little holes and canals\nthat run through the skull and through\nthe depth of the skull like little tubes\nyou've got them down here on your\nmandible you've got them above your lips\nyou have them um on either sides of your\nnose those are the sinuses the sinuses\nallow the passage of different fluids\nthrough the skull because the skull even\nthough it's bone it's not a dead tissue\nright in a live person or animal the\nskull is a very active\nliving tissue indeed all bone is active\nliving tissue and it needs to be\nnourished with blood it needs to be\nnourished with cerebral spinal fluid in\nthe case of the skull it needs to be\nnourished with all sorts of important\nthings so those sinuses oftentimes can\nbecome clogged as is in the case with\nsinus headache which we'll talk about in\na little bit but more generally anytime\nthere's inflammation of one given area\nof the body so it could be a shoulder it\ncould be the neck it could be the mouth\nit could be the nose or in the case of\nthe headache it could be any portion of\nthe head or neck\nwhat happens is inflammation while it's\na very efficient signal it's much like\nthe siren on an ambulance or a police\ncar and that it sends out a very broad\nsignal that's very clear something is\nwrong here and needs to be dealt with\nit's not very specific so it's very\nrobust but it's not very specific so for\ninstance if there's a little bacterial\ninfection or a little viral infection\nthe inflammation response to that site\nof infection tends to be far more\nwidespread than the actual site of\ninfection it's a little bit different\nwhen you have a foreign object there\nlike a splinter or some other foreign\nobject that tends to be a bit more\nlocalized and the immune system is\nalways trying to limit the the extent of\ninflammation by putting in different\nscar tissues indeed a lot of the things\nthat we think of as kind of gross\nyou know pustules and boils and things\nlike that I know it's a gross topic are\nways in which our body tries to restrict\nthe amount of inflammation but the face\narea and the head itself are so heavily\ninfused with blood vessels and there's a\nconstant perfusion as we say of blood\nand cerebral spinal fluid and other\nthings through this incredibly\nmetabolically active tissue that we call\nour brain and our eyes those are by far\nthe most metabolically active tissues in\nour entire body even if we're running\nhundreds of miles in Ultra marathons\nyour brain is still far more\nmetabolically demanding than all the\nmuscles of your body combined no matter\nwhat the conditions because of that\nthere tends to be a generalization or a\nspreading out of any inflammatory\nresponse and that inflammatory response\nthen can trigger the pain mechanisms or\nwhat we've experience as pain mechanisms\nin the other three types of tissues that\nwe talked about so for instance if you\nhave a systemic infection or you're\nexperiencing inflammation of any kind\nand it has anything to do with or\nencroaches on the face or head area that\ncan easily and almost always\nspills over into activation of nerve\ncells can give rise to neural based\nheadache or to the meninges and can give\nrise to meningeal headaches and of\ncourse to the muscles and to muscular\ntype headaches so we've got muscular\norigins of the ache in headache we have\nmeningeal origins of the achin headache\nwe have neural origins of the aching\nheadache and we have inflammation-based\norigins of the ache in headache and that\npertains to all the different types of\nheadaches that we're going to talk about\nand it's important to keep in mind that\nthere are these different sources of the\nache and headache and that sometimes\nthey exist alone and sometimes they\nexist in combination however this isn't\nimportant however\nall pain\nor I should say all experience of pain\nas a perception\nis going to be neural in origin when we\nexperience pain whether or not it's a\npin prick or a cut stub our toe we trip\nand fall or a headache it is neural in\norigin it is the nervous system and\nnerve cells that are going to carry that\nsignal that we perceive as pain so as we\ntalk about the different sources of pain\nand different types of headache we will\nalso talk about of course I think what\nmost people are interested in today's\ndiscussion the different treatments for\nthe different types of headache and why\neach of those different treatments work\nbut by understanding a little bit about\nhow pain arises in the nervous system\nand certainly by understanding the\ndifferent types of headaches you know\nwhat is a tension headache I gave you\nsome impression that it's running around\nyour head like a headband in many cases\nversus cluster headache which starts\ndeep below the eye often it feels as if\nit's emerging from deep in the brain\nversus migraine which we'll get into in\na moment by understanding the different\ntypes of headaches you should be able to\nquickly pinpoint what type of headache\nyou have what types of tissues are\nlikely involved and therefore what types\nof treatments are going to most quickly\nand most completely relieve that type of\nheadache okay so for the next three to\nfive minutes and I promise no more I'm\ngoing to explain how pain arises at the\nlevel of nerve cells and I suppose this\nis one of those times when if I had a\nhighlighter pen that could go out and\nacross the the microphones and speakers\nleading to your ears\nI would use it here because what I'm\nabout to tell you is perhaps one of the\nmost important things to understand\nabout your nervous system that is your\nbrain and you which is that while you\nhave trillions of neurons and we hear\nthat you have trillions and different\ntypes of neurons in your brain and they\ncome in different shapes and sizes and\ndo different things and some make\ndopamine and some make serotonin and so\nmake glutamate and on and on\nthe key distinction among different\ntypes of neurons that is the three types\nof neurons that I believe everybody\nscientists are no everybody should\nunderstand exist are some neurons nerve\ncells are what we call motor neurons in\nthe sense that they control the\ncontraction of muscles sometimes for\nwalking other neurons control the\nmovements of your fingers scientists\ncall those digits\nother ones your toes\nthey also control the beating of your\nheart\nalthough that's a slightly different\nmechanism and slightly different type of\ntissue than is involved in generating\nmotor movements of your limbs\nthese are neurons that we call motor\nneurons because their goal or their\npurpose I should say they don't really\nknow what their their goal or purpose is\nbut what they do is they make sure that\nmuscles contract so that certain things\nhappen in your body like your heart\nbeats or you move your limbs you lift\nyour eyelids or your eyebrows rather\nand so on and so forth\nother types of neurons are what we call\nSensory neurons\nthey communicate\nthe same way that motor neurons do that\nis they fire what we call Action\npotentials which are just electrical\nsignals they release neurotransmitters\nlike any other neuron but they respond\nto certain events in the environment or\nthe environment within the body\nbut they are not responsible for\ngenerating muscular contractions so we\ncall these Sensory neurons some Sensory\nneurons sense light touch other Sensory\nneurons sense firm touch other sensory\nneurons sense pain other Sensory neurons\nsense light brushing on the skin in fact\nyou have Sensory neurons believe it or\nnot that respond specifically to the\nlight brushing of a hand across your\nskin any region of your body and if that\nparticular region of your body happens\nto have hair on it and you stroke the\nskin in the direction that the hairs lay\ndown\nwe experience that as pleasurable\nwhereas if you stroke in the direction\nopposite to the the way the hairs lay\ndown we experience that as not\npleasurable so these Sensory neurons\nrespond in some cases for instance\nwithin the auditory system they respond\nto sound waves and your eye they respond\nto photons of light sometimes photons of\nlight of particular wavelengths that we\nthink of as red green blue and so on\nSensory neurons don't move muscles they\nrespond to things in the environment and\nthey exist within us so we have Sensory\nneurons that sense for instance pressure\nwithin our head or pressure within our\ngut how full or empty our gut is\npain within our tissues like our liver\nor or any kind of other internal organ\nso we've got motor neurons Sensory\nneurons and then the last kind of neuron\nis what we call modulatory neurons these\nare the ones that adjust the\nrelationship between the sensory neurons\nand the motor neurons to determine\nwhether or not we do anything in\nresponse to a sensory input that is\nwhether or not if a sensory neuron fires\nsends it electrical potential whether or\nnot it will generate a motor change let\nme give you a very simple example of\nthis so for those of you listening I'll\njust explain what I'm doing and for\nthose of you watching you'll be able to\nsee I'm holding my hand out in front of\nme\nif I were to touch the top of my hand\nwith my fingertip I can deliberately\noverride that is I can modulate that\nmore typical reflex which is that when\nsomething touches us if we're not aware\nof where it's coming from we typically\nmove away from that thing that touches\nthis is a very natural response but we\ncan decide we're not going to move away\nwe can decide to stay still or we can\ndecide to move toward the thing that\ntouches us but typically if you were to\nwalk up to somebody and you were to\ntouch them they'd either turn toward you\non the side that you touch them or\nthey'd step away it's rare that they're\ngoing to step into you but you could\ndecide that you were not going to move\naway or you could step into the\ndirection of touch and that's because\nyou have modulatory neurons that can\nadjust the conversation in a very\ncontext-dependent way\nas to whether or not the sensory neuron\nwill cause motor neurons to contract or\nnot okay so we've got motor neuron\nSensory neurons and modulatory neurons\nand you're probably thinking by now why\nare we talking about this I thought we\nwere talking about headache I thought\nwe're going to talk about treatments for\nheadache but this turns out to be very\nimportant because you could imagine and\nin a moment I'll explain how let's say\nyou have tension headaches you're\nsomebody that has the classic symptoms\nof tension headache let me tell you what\nthose are these are headaches again that\noccur more or less on on the in a kind\nof a headband like fashion or they tend\nto start there\nand exist around that these are very\ncommon they can arise from a number of\ndifferent sources rise from sleep\ndeprivation they can rise from excessive\nuse of caffeine intake we'll talk about\nwhy that is they can arise from stress\nthey can arise from very low level viral\ninfections or bacterial infections but\nwe experience these as just as headaches\nwhere you've been thinking too hard or\nworking too hard or life has been\nstressful they're often also associated\nwith jaw pain and jaw tightness and neck\ntightness so tension headaches\neverything you'd imagine muscular\ntension could cause well if you want to\ntreat tension headache\nyou can imagine that because all\nheadache is neural that you'd want to go\nafter some sort of neural mechanism to\ntreat them but of course we now know\nthat there are three types of neurons\nthere are motor neurons Sensory neurons\nand modulatory neurons so we have\nchoices we can say okay do we want to\nturn off the muscles in the head jaw and\nneck that are hyper contracted\nfor instance you want to take a muscle\nrelaxer or relaxedant\nor would you want to try and change the\nsensory input itself maybe don't change\nthe way the muscles are behaving but\nshut off the sensory part of it your\nability to sense it\nthere are certainly ways you can do that\nor would you want to adjust the\nmodulatory neurons would you want to\nmake it such that you have the headache\nbut you don't perceive the headache that\nis you cut off communication between the\nsensor and the motor so that the muscles\nrelax turns out there are treatments and\napproaches for each and every one of\nthose each and every one of those has\ndifferent advantages and disadvantages\nbut as you can quickly see we are going\nto have different types of headaches and\ndifferent approaches to treating\nheadache but if you keep in the back of\nyour mind that you have neurons that\ncontract muscles to create movement or\ntension of muscles remember you can turn\noff those neurons and allow those\nmuscles to relax you have Sensory\nneurons that sense input and actually\nsense the pain and you have modulatory\nneurons which can allow you to adjust\nthe relationship between the sensory\nneurons and the motor neurons and of\ncourse some of you are probably\nscreaming at me by now saying wait why\nwould you ever want to deal with the\nmotor neurons or or the modulatory\nneurons once you want to just go\nstraight to the source and just cut off\nthe pain ah well the problem there is\nthat many painkillers\nhave other issues as well in particular\nthey can be sedative many of them can be\nhabit forming or even addictive and for\nmany people not all but many people they\ndon't want to take drugs whether or not\nthey're over-the-counter or prescription\ndrugs or even more natural supplement\nbased type treatments\nand they would rather use for instance\na behavioral approach in which they can\nmodulate they can deliberately turn off\nthe communication between Sensory\nneurons and motor neurons and turns out\nthose approaches exist as well okay so\nat this point I promise you that I'm not\ngoing to give you any more of a biology\nlesson in terms of pain sensing and\nheadaches as a more uh conceptual\nphenomenon instead what I'd like to do\nnext is talk about the different types\nof headaches and I think this is\nsomething that's very important and not\noften discussed except for those people\nout there that unfortunately suffer\nrepeatedly from certain kinds of\nheadaches like migraine or cluster or\ntension headache but I think for most\npeople out there who experience headache\nand again that is everybody at some\npoint experiences headache rather than\njust think of headache as one thing\nunderstanding the major types of\nheadache and how they differ from and\nare similar to one another will really\nhelp you identify what the best source\nof treatments for those are so I'd like\nto talk about what the different types\nof headache are now the first type of\nheadache we're going to discuss is the\ntension type headache again tension type\nheadaches tend to start off not always\nbut tend to start off as more or less a\nHalo or a headband around the forehead\nin the area above the eyes often also\ninclude the jaw the neck muscles\nand can extend even into the upper back\nagain this can be caused by some low\nlevel of infection but more often than\nnot tension type headaches are going to\ncome on because of some chronic\npsychological stress usually combined\nwith lack of sleep usually combined with\nlifestyle issues and of course without\ngetting into a long discussion about it\nanytime you have lack of sleep you're\ngoing to have excessive stress anytime\nyou have excessive stress you're going\nto have to make sure you're offsetting\nthat by getting proper sleep most people\ndon't when they're under excessive\nstress by the way we have excellent\ntools we're grounded in excellent\nscience available to you at zero cost if\nyou are experienced chronic stress or\neven short-term stress we have a master\nstress episode of the human Lab podcast\nagain just go to hubermanlab.com and all\nthat's time stamped for you tension type\nheadaches\nbegin in a more or less a headband\npattern but can really extend to other\ntissues as well not so often in the face\nbut really the head and often will start\nto climb up toward the top of the head\nthey are not always in this Halo pattern\nsometimes they can be localized to one\narea such as the you know the back of\nthe head or the front of the head or one\nside of the head more than others and\nthat's often the case because of tension\nwithin muscles of the neck that tend to\nbias the ache towards one side of the\nhead I'd like to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors athletic\ngreens athletic greens now called ag-1\nis a

huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 the\nother type of headache that\nunfortunately is very common is migraine\nheadaches migraine headaches are defined\ngenerally as disorders of recurring\nattacks of headaches so people who get\nmigraines often get them in a recurring\nfashion some people get them very often\nother people get them less often but\nmigraines are very debilitating the\nnumbers that is the prevalence of\nmigraine is still pretty debated one\nthing that we know for sure is that\nfemales suffer from migraine headaches\nat a rate at least threefold higher than\ndo males and surprisingly this does not\nseem to have any direct hormonal origin\nbecause we're also going to talk about\nhormonal headaches that is headaches\nthat relate to a dip in estrogen and\nprogesterone a particular phase of the\nmenstrual cycle that is the ovulatory\ncycle so there's a bit of a mystery here\nand the Mystery is why is it that\nmigraine headaches occur at such greater\nfrequency in females even independently\nof the menstrual cycle so when you\ncontrol for changes in hormones that\nstill appears to be the case and overall\nmigraines are very common now the\nnumbers on migraine and just how common\nmigraine is\nare extremely wide this was a little bit\nfrustrating for me in researching this\nepisode\nyou will find for instance that 17 of\nwomen suffer from migraines you will\nalso hear that six percent of males\nsuffer from migraines you will also hear\nthat 43 43 percent of females suffer\nfrom migraine that is recurring\nheadaches that qualify as migraine\nheadaches and that\n17 percent of men suffer from migraine\nheadaches on a recurring basis which is\nagain the definition of a migraine\nheadache or one of the key definitions\nso all we can say for sure is that many\nmany millions of people maybe even\nbillions of people suffer from migraine\nheadaches it's kind of a staggering\nthing to contemplate but we know it's\nextremely common and we know that it's\nmore prevalent in females in any of the\nstudies that you will find in terms of\nthat compare the overall prevalence of\nheadache it's going to be higher\nsubstantially higher in females and\nmales does not seem to be related to the\novulatory menstrual cycle\nthere are some interesting facts related\nto that that I'll just you know touch on\nfor a moment\npregnancy for whatever reason seems to\nbe protective against migraine headaches\nthat is women who suffer from recurring\nmigraines\nbefore they get pregnant when they get\npregnant and often after they give birth\nthey experience fewer migraine headaches\nso there may be something hormonal it\nmay be something else what do we know\nfor sure we know that headache that is\nthe ache in headache is neural so\nwhether or not the origins are hormonal\nor whether or not the origins are\ninflammation or gut microbiome or some\nother feature of the body brain axis\nat this point all we know is that\nneural pain or the experience of pain at\nthe neural level is the final common\npathway and it's more prevalent in\nfemales so as I mentioned migraines tend\nto be recurring so some people get them\nonce a week some people get them once a\nmonth some people get them far more\nfrequently that they can be extremely\ndebilitating oftentimes people\nexperience migraine because it is a\nrecurring phenomenon will know when a\nmigraine is coming on they'll say my\nmigraine is coming on the kind of sense\nit coming\nthere's this notion of Aura and we'll\ntalk about Aura in a little bit some\npeople think of Aura just as visual aura\nor the sense of kind of a haloing of\nlight with the sense that there's\nsomething outside the body the actual\ndefinition of Aura is that\nit's the experience that something is\nabout to happen it's this kind of\nfeeling of anticipation it's not deja vu\ndeja vu is different and very\ninteresting in its own right but\ndifferent it's this feeling that\nsomething's about to happen and the fact\nthat aura is such a prominent feature of\nmigraine headaches or at least that\npeople feel that the headache is coming\non long before they feel the actual ache\nof the headache and the other\ndebilitating symptoms suggests that\nmigraine has something of deep neural\norigin that it arises from deep within\nthe nervous system spinal cord and brain\nand that it's not something like a\ntension headache that is going from\noutside in you know the constriction of\nthe muscles in the jaw and head so\nmigraine headaches are very different\nthan tension headaches even in terms of\nhow they come on or their onset the\nother feature of migraine headaches that\nI think is important to note is that\ndilation of the vessels remember the\nvasodilation so the widening of those\npipes that we call arteries vessels and\ncapillaries is a very prominent feature\nof migraine and fortunately that allows\nfor very particular types of treatment\nand ways of dealing with this pain\nspecific to migraine headaches the other\nfeature that's common in migraine\nheadaches is so-called photophobia many\nof you are probably familiar with\nphotophobia if you've ever been sleep\ndeprived\nsimply if you're sleep deprived\nand you go outside in the morning the\nlight is going to seem very very bright\nmuch brighter than were you to have had\na really good night's sleep and that's\nbecause during sleep there are all sorts\nof reset mechanisms in the brain there's\nthe washing out of metabolic debris and\nthings in the brain the so-called\nlymphatic washout That's essential\nthere's also an adjustment of the neural\ntissue of the eyes which as many of you\nhave heard me say before actually two\npieces of rain that have been extruded\nfrom the cranial Vault so your eyes yes\nindeed are two pieces of brain the only\ntwo pieces of brain outside the cranial\nVault and within your eyes you have\nneurons and mechanisms that adjust the\nthe sort of sensitivity of your eyes to\nlight and of your brain to light and\nwhen you are sleep deprived or when you\nhave a low-level viral infection or a\ncold or a flu of any kind\nyou tend to experience light as brighter\nthan it actually is when you're rested\nor you're in the healthy state so\nphotophobia is something that's very\nvery common in migraine and often the\nphotophobia is a prominent feature of\nthe experience that a migraine is coming\non people will start saying oh you know\nit's just too bright in here and\nnormally they'd be able to tolerate that\nlevel of sunlight or of indoor lighting\nwith no problem\nso\nthere are two aspects of migraine that I\nthink are particularly important to\nunderstand for sake of of the treatment\nand that's the dilation of vessels so we\nif we want to treat migraine we're going\nto have to think about things that can\nconstrict blood vessels in the brain\narea but we also need to think about\nphotophobia not photophobia just as a\nsymptom of migraine but that maybe by\nadjusting our sensitivity to light we\ncan actually short-circuit some of the\nonset and subsequent pathology of the\nmigraine that is if we can prevent\nphotophobia\npartially or completely can actually\noffset a lot of the ache of the migraine\nthat would otherwise occur so that's an\nexciting Avenue for addressing migraine\nheadaches we'll get into photophobia and\nhow to deal with that we'll also talk\nabout Aura a little bit more in a few\nminutes but for the time being we've\ntalked about tension headaches we've now\ntalked about migraine headaches again\nkeep in mind knowing what kind of\nheadache you have is essential it's I\nwould say indispensable for selecting\nthe best treatment many people out there\nwill simply get a headache and decide oh\nI'm going to pop a couple of aspirin\nokay what does aspirin do aspirin's and\nanti-inflammatory it also has pronounced\neffects on the vasodilation and\nvasoconstriction system it actually\nallows more blood to flow through those\narteries vessels and capillaries a lot\nof people actually use baby aspirin or\nsmall amounts of aspirin as a way to\noffset cardiovascular disease that's\nanother discussion but what do we know\nwe know that in migraine there's a hyper\ndilation of the blood vessels a hyper\ndilation of the very little portals that\nexist in the brain and around the brain\nand that are going to cause the pain\nyou're going to activate those Sensory\nneurons those non-iceceptors that will\nthen give us the experience of extreme\nheadache and migraine so taking an\naspirin or something like it for\nmigraine in some cases the worst\npossible Choice again so knowing what\nkind of headache you are experiencing is\ngoing to be essential here the other\nthing that you'll sometimes hear is that\ndrinking a cup of coffee or getting\ncaffeine through tea is a great way to\ndeal with headache\nwhy would that be well it turns out that\ncoffee can cause either vasoconstriction\nor vasodilation depending on when you\ntake it and we'll get into the use of\ncaffeine as a treatment for headache\nbecause indeed it can be a very potent\ntreatment for headache but you\nabsolutely need to know what kind of\nheadache you are experiencing because in\nsome cases drinking caffeine whether\nit's in tea or coffee can absolutely\nalleviate the pain of a headache\nespecially if you catch that onset of a\nmigraine or attention type headache\nearly on but in some cases it can make\nit far far worse again knowing which\ntype of headache you're experiencing and\nhow the different treatments work is key\nokay so we have tension type headaches\nmigraine type headaches I think you're\nstarting to get the picture they have\ndifferent underlying biologies\nthe next type of headache is cluster\nheadaches cluster headaches are the ones\nI mentioned earlier that arise from deep\nwithin the head they feel as if they're\ncoming from the inside out and they tend\nto be on one side or the other what\nscientists and clinicians call\nunilateral and tends to originate behind\nthe eye and sometimes the nose region\nsometimes in the mouth region as well it\nfeels kind of patchy but as if it's\ncoming from the inside out and again\nthat's because of that trigeminal nerve\nfor those of you listening and not\nwatching this on YouTube I've got three\nfingers as if I'm putting up three\nfingers and I'm I've got one pointed\ntoward my eye one pointed towards my\nnose region and one towards my upper lip\nthe trigeminal nerve is an easy one to\nremember and it will completely explain\ncluster headaches and what to do about\ncluster headaches in a moment if you\nremember that the herpes one virus and\nnot herpes two not genital herpes but\nherpes one virus is the one that gives\ncold sores on the mouth\nherpes one virus by the way is\nexceedingly common up to 90 percent of\npeople many children in fact have these\nagain this is not a sexually transmitted\nherpes although it can be of course\ntransmitted through kissing and sexual\ncontact but that's not the only origin\nof it okay it can be passed by skin\ncontact and mucosal contact\num so mucosomucosal so that would be\nkissing mucosa lying or even skin to\nmucosal Linings that's why it's so\ncommon and the reason why cold sores\ndevelop on the mouth for people that\nhave herpes one is because the virus\nactually lives on the trigeminal nerve\nand yes it is true that sometimes the\nvirus will inflame the nerve and the\ninflammation will occur at the level of\nthe eye so people do unfortunately\nsometimes get herpes of the eye it\nactually can be quite dangerous if you\nhave an infection of the eye of a herpes\ninfection in the eye you should see an\nophthalmologist or the nose region they\ncan experience pain in the mucosal\ntissue of the nose more often than not\nthe most inflammation is occurring on\nthe the branch that innervates the lip\nor the region close to the lip and\nthat's why a cold sword develops there\nan immune response there signaling that\nthere's inflammation due to the herpes\nvirus which lives on that neuron for a\nvery long time neurons don't turn over\nin the lifespan so it can live on there\nfor the extent of of the person's life\nhowever most people\nhopefully treat their HSV-1 but if they\ndon't the the sort of frequency and the\nseverity of infections tends to taper\noff with time we'll have an entire\ndiscussion about viruses and herpes in\nparticular in a future episode but the\nthing to keep in mind here is that this\nvery nerve is the one that gets inflamed\nin these cluster type headaches now\ncluster type headaches are associated\nwith a bunch of very uncomfortable\nsymptoms again they tend to be\nunilateral they tend to begin very deep\nand they tend to be excruciatingly\npainful excruciatingly painful they can\nlast anywhere from 30 minutes to three\nhours some people experience these in\nsleep in fact this is one of the cases\nwhere men experience a headache more\nthan females\nmen experience cluster type headaches\nthat have a sudden onset during sleep at\nfive times the frequency than do females\nthe origins of that aren't exactly clear\nthey do seem to have something to do\nwith the biological clock mechanisms the\nso-called circadian mechanisms so if you\nare a man or woman for that matter and\nyou're waking up in the middle of the\nnight with a unilateral headache and it\nseems like it's deep within your\num within your head or it's starting\nthere and it's on one side and localized\nto the eye and maybe these other regions\nthe trigeminal is involved in you may be\nsuffering from cluster type headache and\nyou should talk to your physician the\nother symptom that's quite common in\ncluster type headache is a droopy eyelid\nwhich should make sense because the\ntrigeminal innervates the eye region and\nthere are other nerves that control the\neyelid but they're in that General\nregion and they can be impacted the\nother thing is something called meiosis\nwhich is that you can't dilate the pupil\nI mentioned this before so those your\npupils might get really really small and\nthey won't dilate and the other thing is\nlacrimation tearing and then nasal\ndischarge all because of a neural\ninflammation problem why do I tell you\nwith such detail about cluster headaches\nwell if you are somebody that's\nexperiencing the kind of pain that is\nconsistent with cluster headache taking\na standard anti-inflammatory or doing\nsomething that is going to adjust the\nvial the excuse me the dilation or\nconstriction of blood vessels may have\nan indirect impact on cluster headache\nbut is unlikely to relieve cluster\nheadache either acutely meaning right\naway or in preventing cluster headaches\nyou have to deal with this as a neural\nissue and we'll talk about some of the\nmain causes of inflammation and\nactivation of these cluster type\nheadaches at the level of the trigeminal\nnerve in a little bit because\nfortunately there are some excellent\ntreatments the next type of headache\nthat is quite common are hormonal\nheadaches now the phrase hormonal\nheadache should already cue you to the\nfact that it's far too General a term\nbecause there's so many different\nhormones testosterone estrogen thyroid\nhormone growth hormone and on and on and\non\nand they all have many different\nfunctions in the brain and body every\nsingle hormone and in particular the\nso-called steroid hormones steroids\nagain not just limited to things that\npeople take for Sports in fact the\nsteroid hormones refers to estrogen\ntestosterone of the sort that we all\nmake that men and women\nmake naturally and those steroid\nhormones can impact gene expression they\ncan are of course what turns on the\ngrowth of the of the breast tissue of\nthe testicular tissue of the hair growth\nand on and on and that's all because of\ngene expression if you're really going\nto change the identity and function of a\ncell long term\nright you're going to literally change\nthe breast tissue or change the penile\ntissue or change the ovarian tissue in\nsome sort of consistent way across the\nlifespan you can bet that there are\nchanges in gene expression and those\nchanges in gene expression occur because\nthese steroid hormones have this\nincredible ability sort of like the\nX-Men of hormones to pass through the\nouter membrane of a cell which we call\nthe extracellular membrane and into the\nso-called nuclear membrane they can go\ninto the area where genes are made and\nturn on and off different genes however\nthey multitask in their life that is\nthese steroid hormones like estrogen in\nparticular and testosterone in\nparticular can also bind to the surface\nof cells and impact all sorts of things\nat the level of the cells that have\nnothing to do with changes in gene\nexpression and that second mechanism of\nbinding to the surface of cells is one\nof the ways in which estrogen can\ncontrol\ndifferent aspects of headache now that\ndoesn't necessarily mean the estrogen\ngives you headaches in fact it's just\nthe opposite\nit turns out that low estrogen and\nanother hormone low progesterone combine\nto give rise to headache because of the\nways that low estrogen and low\nprogesterone impact vasodilation\nand vasoconstriction and the\ninflammatory response we'll talk about\nhow to deal with hormone-based headaches\na particular hormone was headaches that\noccur because of low estrogen and\nprogesterone in a moment but the key\nthing to know is something that we\ncovered in the fertility episode I did a\nvery long very detailed episode on\nfertility so I'm not going going to go\ninto this in significant detail now you\ncan refer to that episode for probably\nmore detail than you ever wanted but\nalso a lot of tools as it relates to\nfertility in both males and females but\nright now I'm just going to give you a\ncourse overview of that in about 60 to\n120 seconds so that you'll understand\nwhen hormonal headaches are most likely\nto take place keep in mind that hormonal\nheadaches are most likely to take place\nwhen estrogen and progesterone are\nlowest\nso if you understand that during the\nfollicular stage of the ovulatory slash\nmenstrual cycle okay so menstrual cycle\nis about 28 days on average not in\neveryone but it's about 20 days on\naverage and the first half of that\nestrogen starts creeping up up up up up\nup up up up up and as we learn in\nendocrinology estrogen primes\nprogesterone so estrogen will then Peak\nand then start to fall\npretty quickly right about the time that\nthe egg ovulates an egg is released and\nwill essentially be ready for\nfertilization if the egg is fertilized a\nwhole bunch of other things happen as it\nrelates to pregnancy if not what ends up\nhappening is that during the ludial\nphase which is the second half of the\nmenstrual cycle there's been a buildup\nof the lining of the uterus\nbecause of an increase in progesterone\nso estrogen goes up during the\nfollicular phase then it goes down and\nthen progesterone goes up up up up up\nwhich is important for generating that\nthick lining of the uterus to allow the\nfertilized egg if it's fertilized to\nimplant and if it's not fertilized all\nof that gets released from the body in\nthis bleeding process that we call\nmenstruation if menstruation occurs and\nday one of the menstrual cycle is\nconsidered the first day in which\nbleeding occurs well then what that\nmeans is that estrogen is already low\nbecause remember estrogen was low at the\nstart of the follicular phase and went\nup up up up up up then it comes down\nright at the time of ovulation and\nprogesterone goes up up up up up during\nthe luteal phase in fact it's more than\na thousand fold increase in progesterone\nbut if there's no fertilization of the\negg progesterone starts coming down down\ndown down down what does that mean that\nmeans that on the first to about the\nfourth or fifth day of the menstrual\ncycle first being the first day of\nbleeding until about the fourth or fifth\nday of the menstrual cycle both estrogen\nand progesterone are very very low and\nit is at that time at the very beginning\nof the menstrual cycle so about the\nfirst week of the menstrual cycle that\nmany women are very prone to hormonal\nheadaches hormonal headaches not because\nestrogens High that's a common\nmisconception rather because estrogen\nand progesterone are both low and now\nthat you understand the Contour or the\nunder underlying reasons for hormonal\nheadache\nyou can start to ask well what happens\nwhen estrogen is low well estrogen has a\nstrong impact on the vasodilation\nvasoconstriction system as does\nprogesterone we'll talk about that a\nlittle bit later but now that you know\nwhat hormonal headache is at least this\none particular type of hormonal headache\nwhich is very very common given the\nnumber of women that are menstruating\nand the fact that low estrogen low\nprogesterone is the cause of the\nhormonal headache and the fact that of\ncourse there are women who are no longer\nmenstruating so they're either in\nperimenopause and menstruation is\nbecoming more infrequent or they're in\nmenopause and it deceased entirely well\nnow you understand what the origin of\nthe hormonal headache is and so all we\nneed to know is what do estrogen and\nprogesterone normally do in order to\nprevent headache and thereby you'll know\nexactly how to offset that is prevent or\ntreat hormonal headache in that first\nweek of the menstrual period the last\ntype of headache that I'd like to\ndiscuss is headache associated with head\nhits that is traumatic brain injury\nalthough I definitely want to underscore\nthe fact that even people who do not\nhave traumatic brain injury can\nexperience headaches as the consequence\nof hitting their head so the line\nbetween traumatic brain injury and lower\nlevel brain injury is one that still\nseeks definition in fact this is one of\nthe major goals of the clinical field as\nit relates to concussion you know it's\nalso what comes up a lot during the\ndiscussion about football you know these\ndays you'll see players hit really hard\nand depending on whether or not they're\nlaying there for five seconds 30 seconds\nor three minutes you know the crowd and\nthe uh the people watching on television\nand everywhere else are all speculating\nas to whether or not the person should\nbe allowed to play and to be quite\ndirect there really is no way to assess\nthe extent of brain damage after the\nconsequence of hitting one's head or\nhaving one's head hit\nbecause\nfirst of all almost all of the best ways\nto detect traumatic brain injury except\nthe most severe ones\ntend to require a lot of very large\nequipment like MRI and functional MRI\nand CT scans none of which are available\non the side of the field or in the\nlocker room but also because many many\nif not most of the effects of traumatic\nbrain injury are going to occur not in\nthe immediate minutes or even hours\nafter the injury but several hours days\nor even weeks after that injury this is\na discussion that we should hold off for\na longer full episode on traumatic brain\ninjury keeping in mind of course that\nfootball is this very Salient example\nof traumatic brain injury and concussion\nas is boxing as is even soccer with\nheading of the ball Believe It or Not\nrepeated low level impact to the\nforehead and other parts of the head can\ngive rise to over time traumatic brain\ninjury without the need for any kind of\nfull-blown concussion or being quote\nunquote knocked out but sports related\nconcussion actually occupies just a tiny\nfraction of the majority of traumatic\nbrain injury and concussion\nmost traumatic brain injury and\nconcussion and low-level brain injury\nthat can accumulate over time to become\ntraumatic for sake of daily living that\nis lowered cognition disruption and mood\nsleep Etc\nis actually the consequence of things\nother than Sports so for instance\nbicycle accidents playground accidents\nconstruction accidents and this is often\nforgotten for some reason all the sports\nin particular football tend to grab all\nthe attention as it relates to\nconcussion keep in mind that while for\ncertain people is a path to a living for\nmost people traumatic brain injury is\ngoing to occur in a car accident\nconstruction work or other types of work\nfor which people generally don't have\nmany options in terms of the type of\nwork that they're doing so they are\nprone to concussions and head injuries\nsimply by virtue of their work without\nany you know millions of dollars\ncontracts or the opportunities\nnecessarily some cases they do but\nnecessarily to do other things and\ncertainly car accidents or bike bicycle\naccidents are not voluntary events so\nthe point being traumatic brain injury\nand headache related traumatic brain\ninjury extends far beyond the realm of\nsports and in fact if you were to look\nat the numbers what you find is that\nmore than 90 percent of traumatic brain\ninjury so people coming into the\nhospital or clinic are people claiming\nthat they've got consistent headaches\nthey're not sleeping well their mood is\noff they're feeling more irritable after\nhaving hit their head even once\nis not the consequence of sports it's\ngoing to be the consequence of accidents\neither on at the workplace or in terms\nof a bicycle or other sorts of\nTransportation based accident like a car\naccident with that in mind any kind of\nhead hit certainly involves a concussion\nor traumatic brain injury often leads to\nheadaches either infrequent but severe\nheadaches or chronic low-level headaches\nor a feeling there's kind of a\nstuffiness or a fullness to the head\nthere can be a lot of different Origins\nto that\na common origin is going to be actual\nswelling of the not necessarily the\nbrain tissue directly but if you recall\nour discussion about the meninges which\ninclude the dura and the other tissues\nthat surround the brain they're actually\nthree layers that we call the meninges\nthe durages being one of them and\nthere's a very little space between\nthose the brain the meninges that\nsurround it and the skull it's called\nthe subarachnoid space very cool right\narachnoid like spider\nwell if there's even a slight bit of\nswelling in the brain or even distant\nbrain tissue so for instance even if the\nthere's Whiplash so there's swelling of\nthe tissue muscular tissue and neural\ntissue in the neck area that can\nconstrict the flow of things like\ncerebral spinal fluid blood flow and\nindeed mucus and other other things that\nare essential we all hear mucus and we\nthink Illness but mucus is a vital vital\nsubstance within the body for a lot of\nimportant reasons in health as well as\nin sickness well if there's less of that\nliquid and other fluids and mucus being\ndelivered to that space well then it can\nclog up so sort of the plumbing is\nclogged up or that it's caught at the\nlevel of the site of hit or injury\nbecause there's some local swelling and\ninflammation there so there are many\ndifferent mechanisms that can underlie\nheadache associated with head hits or\ntraumatic brain injury now fortunately\nthere are some recent data pointing to\nsome what I would call non-obvious\ntreatments for headache in traumatic\nbrain injury keeping in mind that\nanytime we're talking about injury or\ndisease or health for that matter mental\nhealth or physical health we have to\nhighlight\na fact that's going to come up again and\nagain in every single episode of this\npodcast and I think it's not being\noverly redundant to do so which is that\nregular\nsufficient amounts of deep sleep each\nnight are going to be important for all\naspects of mental health physical health\nand performance and have been shown over\nand over again to reduce the frequency\nof headache and to reduce the time to\nrepair after traumatic brain injury and\ncan improve cognition and on and on and\non so sleep is essential for all the\nnormal things that encourage healthy\nactivity of the different tissues that\nare involved in brain and body to occur\nso sleep deprivation of course is going\nto limit those but I do want to point\nout that sleep\nsunlight and I've talked about this\nalmost ad nauseam on this podcast but\nregular circadian Cycles getting\nsunlight in your eyes early in the day\nand in the evening as well and as much\nas possible throughout the day without\nburning your skin and limiting your\nexposure to artificial lights at night\nand on and on all of which is covered in\nthe light for health episode of The\nhuberman Lab podcast the master sleep\nepisode The huberman Lab podcast and in\nthe perfect your sleep episode The\nhuberman Lab podcast you can find all\nthat at hubermanlab.com getting light\nand avoiding light at the proper times\nof the 24 hour cycle is also going to\nfavor all the pathways ranging from gut\nbrain access to the inflammatory\nanti-inflammatory Pathways neural\nPathways Etc that of course if you do\nthat you're going to improve and offset\nany kind of detriment caused by\ntraumatic brain injury is it treating\ntraumatic brain injury directly no but\nis not getting sufficient sleep not\ngetting sunlight at the right times of\nday and getting too much artificial\nlight at night going to make any impact\nof traumatic brain injury including\nheadache far worse yes there are\ncertainly a ton of data to support that\nstate statement as well and then of\ncourse nutrition and exercise are also\nimportant so we can list out sleep Sun\nproper nutrition exercise and I would\nput a proper social connection whatever\nthat means to you healthy social\nconnections include romantic\nfriendship familial and relationship to\nself those five things sleep exercise\nSun nutrition and social connection are\nall critical for maintaining baselines\nof health and raising your baselines of\nhealth and I mentioned that I can\nsegment this out now because I think\nthat anytime we're about to start\ndiscussing pointed treatments that is\nthings that you can take or do to reduce\nheadache or things that you can take or\ndo to improve anything within mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwe have to remember that the foundation\nof mental health physical health and\nperformance is only set at its highest\nlevel by tending to those other things\nand that nothing really surpasses any of\nthose things or put differently there's\nno replacement for any of those things\nin the form of a pill a powder even a\nbehavioral practice there are things you\ncan do to offset getting less than ideal\nsleep the things that you can use like\nbright artificial lights during the day\nto try and partially offset lack of\nsunlight but really there is no exercise\npill there is no sunlight device\nalthough some bright lights are very\nbright there's no no replace basement\nfor actual sunlight there's no\nreplacement for actual sleep there's no\nreplacement for actual nutrition and I\ndo feel it's an important conversation\nto have as we head into the next segment\nwhich is what can you take or do to\nreduce headache and in order to address\nthis we're going to start first with the\nheadaches associated with head hits and\ntraumatic brain injury because turns out\nthere's a surprising and very useful\napproach to doing that but\nthis same approach also can help offset\nand treat headache in other conditions\nas well meaning not just for headaches\ncaused by traumatic brain injury but\nalso headaches caused by sudden onset\nTension Headache or migraine headache or\neven perhaps again perhaps cluster type\nheadaches so the first substance that\nI'd like to highlight that has been\nshown to significantly reduce the\nintensity and or frequency of headaches\nis creatine now creatine as many of you\nknow is something that people supplement\nand take\nmost often creatine is discussed in the\ncontext of muscle performance not just\nfor people who weightlift but for people\nwho do endurance exercise and it's often\nbeen said that 5 to 10 grams per day of\ncreatine monohydrate depending on how\nmuch you weigh 5 to 10 grams per day of\ncreatine monohydrate can increase\ncreatine phosphate stores in muscles can\nbring more water into muscles can make\nyou stronger get increased power output\nand that is all true that is all\ncompletely true we discussed this in the\nhuberman lab podcast with Dr Andy Galpin\nwhen he was a guest on the Hebrew and\nLab podcast or standard series and we\ndiscussed this extensively in an\nupcoming episode from Dr Andy Galpin in\nhis special\nsix-part guest Series where he is a\nguest on the Hebrew Lab podcast but\nwhere really he's the one doing the\nmajority of the teaching that series\ncovers everything from strength\nhypertrophy endurance and there's an\nepisode on supplementation where we go\ndeep into the discussion about creatine\nnow in that discussion and again now\nwe highlight the fact that creatine\nWhile most often discussed online and in\nthe media as a supplement for sports\nperformance for the reasons I just\nmentioned\nactually has far more data behind it\nthat is laboratory studies exploring the\nrole of creatine in the clinical setting\nso I'd like to highlight a paper from\nthat literature now that will make very\nclear as to why creatine is interesting\nand in fact very effective for treating\nheadache and particular headache caused\nby head hits or traumatic brain injury\nthe title of the paper is prevention of\ntraumatic headache dizziness and fatigue\nwith creatine Administration now keep in\nmind this is a pilot study it was\nperformed in humans so when you hear the\nwords pre-clinical that is if you hear\nthere was a pre-clinical study on blank\nthat means almost always that the study\nwas performed on animal models mice rats\nprimates Etc\na clinical trial is something that's\ncarried out on humans and a pilot study\nmeans that the study was carried out on\nhumans but on a fairly small cohort a\nvery fairly small group uh or limited\nnumber of subjects nonetheless if the\ndata are robust as it is in this case of\nthis paper I think it's worth paying\nattention to so in this study what they\nlooked at was creatine Administration so\nwhat they did is they had people ingest\na certain amount of creatine I'll tell\nyou in a moment\nin fluid so it could be taken in water\nmilk with or without food doesn't really\nmatter what time of day\nthey had people take creatine why would\nthey have people take creatine after\ntraumatic brain injury and in particular\nfor people that are suffering from\nheadache dizziness fatigue Etc the\nreason is that\nneurons nerve cells rely very heavily on\nthe regulation of calcium in order to\ngenerate those Action potentials to\ncommunicate with one another so it\ndoesn't matter if it's a motor neuron a\nsensory neuron or a modulatory neuron\nthey all generate Action potentials or\nsomething similar to it and calcium is\nimportant for that process calcium\nbecomes dysregulated after traumatic\nbrain injury in a number of different\nways\nin particular in ways that impact the\nenergy production systems of cells that\nare related to ATP adenosine\ntriphosphate for those facionados out\nthere that want to look it up you can\nsimply look up calcium ATP and neurons\nand you can learn about that cycle\ncreatine\ncan be stored in muscles as we talked\nabout before but creatine and in\nparticular the phosphorylated form of\ncreatine which is the readily available\nfuel source\nform of creatine can also be stored in\nbrain tissue and is actually quite\nprominently stored in the forebrain the\narea where the real estate of of your\nbrain just behind the forehead which is\ninvolved in planning and action and\nunderstanding context so it's very\nimportant for cognition\nit's important for personality too but\nit's important for a number of different\naspects of life that have to do with\nmaking plans being able to focus very\nintensely on your work etc or on\nanything for that matter all functions\nthat become heavily disrupted in people\nwho have traumatic brain injury and\nconcussion\ncreatine's ability to communicate with\nthe calcium in the ATP system was the\nmotivation behind the study that is the\nauthors hypothesize on the basis of\npre-clinical data in animals\nthat by increasing creatine stores\nwithin the brain not just in the muscle\nbut in particular within the brain\nthat\nthe availability of creatine would allow\nfor better cognitive function in general\nnow they didn't look at cognition\nspecifically in this paper but they did\nlook at the other aspects that is that\nthe bad stuff associated with TBI and\nthey had people supplement with creatine\nat a level that is much higher than the\ntypical level that people supplement\nwith creatine Simply for Sports\nPerformance so as I mentioned before\nmost people if they supplement with\ncreatine for sports performance they\ntake creatine monohydrate\ntypically five grams per day sometimes\n10 grams per day if they're about 100\nkilograms or or greater in body weight\n100 kilograms is 200 approximately 220.\npounds so the dosage that was used for\nsupplementing creatine in this study\nto address the potential impact of\ncreatine on headache dizziness and\nfatigue was quite a bit higher than the\ndosages used simply for muscle\nperformance in this study they had\npeople take a dose of 0.4 grams of\ncreatine monohydrate per kilogram of\nbody weight so for somebody that weighs\n100 kilograms or 220 pounds that would\nbe 40 grams of creatine per day if\nsomeone weighs half that much they would\ntake 20 grams of creatine per day and\nthey did that over a period of six\nmonths and we know that when you take\ncreatine over and over day to day that\nthere's a buildup of creatine stores\nboth in the muscles and within the brain\ntissue now what they found as a\nconsequence of this creatine\nAdministration was really striking and I\nthink quite exciting they found a very\nsignificant decrease in the frequency of\nheadache in people that were\nsupplementing with creatine as opposed\nto the controls now keep in mind that\nthis is a pilot study but the effects\nare very dramatic they found a very\nstatistically significant decrease\nincrease in the frequency of headache in\npeople that were taking creatine in fact\nif you look at the controls and you see\nthat they're basically getting headache\nat a frequency of 90 percent or more\nafter TBI the reduction in headache\nfrequency is down to about 10 or 12\npercent in the people taking creatine so\nthat's quite quite a dramatic effect and\nif you look at the other measures they\ntook\nkeep in mind again this is a pilot study\nso a limited number of subjects but\nagain the results are very impressive\nwhat they found is that the number of\npeople experiencing dizziness was\nsignificantly reduced in people\nsupplementing with creatine as was the\nnumber of people experiencing fatigue\nand acute fatigue and chronic fatigue\nagain not chronic fatigue syndrome per\nse but chronic fatigue which was in this\nstudy defined as a general sense of\nbodily weakness and even mental weakness\nmental weakness is a little bit hard to\nquantify but they were very careful to\ndistinguish between cognitive and mental\nfatigue versus physical and somatic\nfatigue they acknowledge that both of\nthose occur in TBI or post-tbi the\nheadache is quite frequent basically the\ntakeaway of the study is that for people\nexperiencing headache dizziness and\nfatigue\ndue to TBI and perhaps and I want to\nunderline perhaps because it hasn't\nreally been explored yet but perhaps\nheadache dizziness and fatigue due to\nother conditions symptoms\nor causes of headache creatine\nmonohydrate supplementation might be\nagain might be an excellent candidate\nfor people to try why do we say that\nwell first of all creatine monohydrate\nis relatively inexpensive it's\nconsidered safe at the dosages used in\nthis study and certainly for sports\nperformance as well and\nthere are very few other compounds that\nhave been shown to have as significant\nan impact on headache over the long term\nas has creatine monohydrate in these\nstudies of people with TBI it's also\nimportant to highlight the fact that\nmany many people suffer from tbis I\nmentioned earlier and as now there are\nvery few treatments for TBI you tend to\nget the basic advice coming back and\nagain I think it's excellent advice you\nknow get proper amounts of sleep get\nexercise but don't get another traumatic\nbrain injury that's obvious but you'd be\nsurprised how many people go right back\nto work because they have to and you\nknow we have to be sympathetic to the\nfact that many people just can't stop\nworking or go on disability\nso many people have to go back to work\nthat could be sport or it could be other\nkind of work where they are then subject\nto perhaps getting more TBI maybe\nthey're getting less rest as a\nconsequence and stress obviously stress\nis a confounding issue for TBI but sleep\nexercise Sun nutrition\nall of those things proper social\nconnection are what people are\nencouraged to do when they have TBI but\nthere have been very few compounds in\nparticular very few over-the-counter\ncompounds that are known to be safe that\nhave shown efficacy in dealing with TBI\nso I think that while this is a pilot\nstudy and we can consider it preliminary\nI think it's important enough and the\neffects were dramatic enough that people\nwith headache and in particular people\nwith TBI ought to consider supplementing\nwith creatine in order to deal with\ntheir headaches and of course I eagerly\nawait other studies exploring the role\nof this high dosage of creatine which is\na relatively high dosage of creatine\nmonohydrate for offsetting headache\nmeanwhile I think there are a number of\npeople out there\nsuffering from headache who might\nconsider using creatine monohydrate in\nan exploratory fashion and seeing\nwhether or not it helps offset their\nheadaches keep in mind of course anytime\nyou're going to add or remove anything\nsupplement or otherwise from your from\nyour treatment your nutrition Etc I do\nsuggest that you consult with your\nphysician in particular if you have\nchronic headaches I don't say that to\nprotect me I say that of course to\nprotect you I'd like to take a

find\nextremely exciting why well what I'm\nabout to describe is a compound or I\nshould say a set of compounds that are\navailable over the counter that have\nbeen shown to be very effective in\nreducing the frequency and intensity of\nheadaches and not just one kind of\nheadache but multiple types of headaches\nso what I'll describe has been shown to\nhave significant effects in reducing the\nintensity or frequency of tension type\nheadaches migraine type headaches as\nwell as hormone type headaches that are\nrelated to the menstrual cycles that I\ndescribed earlier now there are a lot of\ndata centered around this General topic\nbut I'm going to focus on three main\npapers but I haven't told you yet of\ncourse is what is the compound that I'm\nreferring to what is this\nover-the-counter compound well it turns\nout this over-the-counter compound is\nnot just available over the counter it's\nalso available in food so it turns out\nthat nutrition can have a very strong\nimpact on the frequency and intensity of\nheadache although supplementation with\nthis particular compound can accomplish\nthe same thing as well what I'm\nreferring to here are omega-3 fatty\nacids many of you are probably familiar\nwith omega-3 fatty acids these are fatty\nacids that come in the form of so-called\nEPA and DHA and omega-3 fatty acids are\ncommonly distinguished from the\nso-called omega-6 fatty acids omega-6\nfatty acids come in a bunch of different\nfoods and they of course can be\nsupplemented as well omega-3 fatty acids\ncome in a bunch of different foods and\ncan be supplemented as well Common forms\nof omega-3 fatty acids or I should say\ncommon sources of omega-3 fatty acids in\nFoods include fatty ocean fish including\nsalmon salmon skins sardines anchovies\nthings of that sort\ncommon sources in supplement form are\nso-called fish oil\ncapsules or liquid fish oil again\nomega-3 fatty acids and almost always\nwhen we're talking about omega-3 fatty\nacids we're talking about a combination\nof EPA and DHA but really it is the\nquantity of EPA\nomega-3 fatty acids that seems to be the\nmost impactful for the sorts of Health\nmetrics that we're going to talk about\nin a few minutes\nnow with respect to omega-6 fatty acids\nthe most typical food sources of omega-6\nfatty acids are seed oils I know\nnowadays seed oils have become quite\ncontroversial\nI've given my stance on this in a prior\npodcast but I'll just repeat it for\nthose of you that haven't heard it I am\nnot of the belief that all seed oils are\nbad that they're all inflammatory that\nthey are killing us or making us sick\nthat they are the major cause of\nmetabolic dysfunction Etc however I\nthink it is very clear and I learned\nthis from Dr Lane Norton when he was a\nguest on this podcast and taught us all\nabout nutrition in great depth I highly\nrecommend that episode if you're\ninterested in nutrition that people are\nconsuming a lot more oil generally and a\nlot of those oils that people are\nconsuming more of nowadays include a lot\nof the so-called omega-6 fatty acids and\na lot of those oils are seed oils the\nparticular omega-6 fatty acid that's\ngoing to be relevant for today's\ndiscussion is linoleic acid and that is\ncommon in a lot of seed oils so again\nI'm not going to tell you that seed oils\nare bad however it does seem to be the\ncase that many people are consuming far\ntoo many seed oils and in doing so are\nconsuming far too many calories and\nperhaps are consuming too much of the\nOmega six fatty acids relative to the\nomega-3 fatty acids now with that said I\nthink there is General agreement among\nnutritionists and health professionals\nthat we could all stand to get more\nomega-3 fatty acids perhaps for\ncardiovascular health although that's a\nlittle bit debated but certainly for\nimmune system function\nfor mood and for functioning of the\nbrain and for the potent\nanti-inflammatory effects of Omega-3 so\nagain Omega-3s can be sourced from food\nboth animal based and plant-based you\ncan simply go online and look up the\nvarious food-based sources but\nin thinking about headache and different\ntreatments for headache there are some\nrecent studies exploring how\nsupplementing with omega-3 fatty acids\nand in one case how supplementing with\nomega-3 fatty acids and deliberately\nreducing the amount of linoleic acid the\nomega-6 fatty acids how that can impact\nheadache so the first study I'd like to\ndescribe in reference to the role of\nomega-3 fatty acids and headache was\npublished in 2018 and the title of the\npaper is long chain omega-3 fatty acids\nand headache in the U.S population there\nare a number of things that I really\nlike about this study a few of those\ninclude the fact that they looked at an\nenormous number of people that is they\nincluded 12 317 men and women I like the\nfact that they included men and women in\nthe study age 20 or older and that they\nbroke down the population into\ncategories that included age they\ncertainly looked at race and ethnicity\nthey looked at educational background\nthey looked at body mass total energy\nintake which is really important if you\nthink about it people are going to be\neating and within the thing things that\nthey eat they're going to be consuming\nsome Omega-3s hopefully as well some\nomega-6s and if they're eating far more\nthen they're going to get far more of\nlikely going to get far more of both of\nthose things than they would ordinarily\nif they were eating smaller amounts so\nthey controlled for total caloric intake\nin a way that I find\nparticularly useful for looking at these\nkind of data so the reason they explored\nOmega-3s is worth mentioning omega-3\nfatty acids are known to have an\nanti-inflammatory effect that\nanti-inflammatory effect is mediated\nthrough a couple of different Pathways\nwe won't go into these in too much\ndetail now but the omega-3 fatty acids\nkeep in mind actually make up various\nparts of cells in the brain and body\nthat's right the membrane that remember\nI talked before about how steroid\nhormones can go through the different\nmembranes of the cells the outer\nmembrane and the inner membrane a lot of\nthose actual membranes the structural\nconstituents of neurons and other cells\nare actually made up of or include\ncertain fatty acid long-chain fatty\nacids and the omega-3 fatty acids are\nimportant for or the actual construction\nof those tissues as well as having\nanti-inflammatory effects through things\nlike limiting prostaglandins and other\nthings that can cause inflammation okay\nso there are a bunch of different ways\nthat omega-3 fatty acids can be useful\nthey refer in this study to an earlier\nstudy that looked at the so-called\nanalgesic effect the pain relieving\neffect analgesic means pain relieving\neffect of omega-3 fatty acids in what\nhad been a randomized controlled trial\nand in that previous paper what they\nfound was that diets high in Omega-3s\nand low in omega-6s okay so high three\nlow six and as compared to diets that\nwere just reduced omega-6s they found a\ngreater analgesic effect of increasing\nOmega-3s while also reducing omega-6\nfatty acids so in the context of the\nseed oil discussion although keeping in\nmind that omega-6s can come from other\nsources as well if omega-6s were just\nreduced on their own there wasn't as\ngreat in effect in terms of reducing\npain and inflammation as there was when\nomega-3 fatty acids were deliberately\nincreased and omega-6 fatty acids were\nreduced again in all of these studies\nbecause these are the ones in which they\ncontrolled things well as we should as\nwe say they are holding constant the\ncaloric intake so it's not just that\nyou're removing fat eating less fat\nthere's actually a removal of certain\nfats and fatty acids and a replacement\nof those with omega-3 fatty acids in one\ncase in the other case it's just a\nreduction in omega-6s and you're using\nother food types and macronutrients to\noffset that that reduction in calories\ncaused by reducing omega-6s the basic\ntakeaway that they're relying on\nmarching into the study is that\nincreasing Omega-3s and reducing\nomega-6s seems to be beneficial for\nreducing pain and indeed in this study\nthey find something quite similar which\nis that when you hold caloric intake\nconstant and when you look at omega-6s\nwhether or not you decrease omega-6\nfatty acids or not you find is that\nincreasing omega-3 fatty acids\nin the diet so either consumed through\nfood sources or by supplementation was\nassociated with a lower prevalence of\nsevere headache or migraine so severe\ntension type headache or migraine so\nthis is promising and points to the fact\nthat long chain omega-3 fatty acids are\nlikely to have either a pain reducing\nand there's evidence for that and or an\ninflammation reducing effect that can\nsignificantly reduce the severity of\nheadache in both tension type headache\nand in migraine so that's the first\nstudy the second study is a more recent\nstudy it was published in 2021 that used\na I would say a more or less similar\ntype of overall design is the one I'd\nrefer to earlier the title of this paper\nis dietary alteration of what they call\nN3 but those are omega-3 and n6 omega-6\nsorry for this shift in nomenclature I\ndidn't write the paper\ndietary alteration of\nomega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for\nheadache reductions in adults with\nmigraine and this was a randomized\ncontrol trial randomized control trials\ninvolve having people be in one\ncondition where they do one thing and\nthen they get swapped randomly into\nanother condition so they serve as their\nown internal control and that controls\nfor all sorts of things like differences\nin sex differences in age differences in\nhealth background in any number of other\nvariables as best as one can\nin this study they had people either\ningest a diet that had increased\nOmega-3s so increased EPA and DHA or\nincreased\nEPA and DHA and reduced amounts of\nlinoleic acid okay so that's going to\nreduce omega-6s\nor a control diet in which they had\npeople taking well it's essentially the\naverage intake of Omega-3s and omega-6s\nand you can probably already guess what\nthe general results of the study are\ngoing to be the general results were\nthat there were reductions in headaches\nokay the really cool thing is it was a\nmassive reduction in headache okay this\nwas they refer to it as a robust\nreduction in headache in particular for\nthe subjects that increase their\nOmega-3s and reduce the amount of\nlinoleic acid that they took the other\nthing that I really like about this\nstudy is that while they don't know the\nexact underlying mechanism for the\neffect they did spend some time\ndelineating what it is that the omega-3\nand omega-6 fatty acids are likely doing\nto either offset or exacerbate headache\nnow I didn't say that omega-6 fatty\nacids exacerbate headache but it does\nseem that people who ingest more\nlinoleic acid and omega-6 are\nexperiencing more inflammation and that\nis evident in a bunch of different\nconditions one for instance is or\nincreases in things like cgrp cgrp is a\nmolecule that's associated with the\ncalcium signaling pathway it's involved\nin vasodilation the expansion of the\nblood vessels and capillaries and that's\nknown\nas I mentioned earlier to exacerbate\ncertain forms of headache okay there are\nalso forms of headache that can be\ncaused by vasoconstriction we'll talk\nabout one very dramatic example perhaps\nas we get toward the end it's a very\nuncommon example but um it's a it's\ncalled Thunderclap headache and trust me\nyou do not want Thunderclap headache um\nand so we'll talk about Thunderclap\nheadache a little bit later that\ninvolves constriction of the blood\nvessels in any case\nin this paper they they didn't study\nmechanism directly but they're resting\non this known analgesic anti-pain as\nwell as known anti-inflammatory Pathways\nrelated to increasing omega-3 intake and\nsimultaneously resting on the idea where\nI think there's I think we now can say\nconclusion that omega-6 fatty acids in\nparticular linoleic acid\ncan increase inflammation by way of\nincreasing things like cgrp vasodilation\nand some other Pathways related to the\nso-called inflammatory cytokine Pathways\nand there's a whole discussion nowadays\nof What's called the inflammatorium so\nthe basic takeaway is that if you are\ninterested in reducing headache it may\nbe beneficial at least according to\nthese two studies and another one I'll\ntalk about in a moment to increase\namounts of omega-3 fatty acids and that\ncan be done again through the ingestions\nof foods although based on the dosages\nthat we'll talk about in a moment\nincreasing omega-3 fatty acids by taking\nliquid form fish oil which is perhaps\nthe most cost effective way to\nsupplement Omega-3s or capsules which is\nperhaps the most efficient way to\nsupplement Omega-3s relate to a level of\none gram or more of EPA per day again\nthat's the EPA form in particular so if\nyou're for instance taking supplemental\nfish oil or you're getting your Omega-3s\nfrom food and you're getting what you\ndetermine to be 2 000 milligrams or two\ngrams per day of Omega-3s keep in mind\nthat's going to include EPA ndha and it\ndoes seem that getting above one gram\nper day of EPA omega-3 fatty acids\neither through food or supplements or\nboth is going to be the critical\nthreshold for reductions in the\nfrequency and intensity of headaches\nthat include both tension headaches and\nmigraine headaches now some people will\nfind actually that ingesting far more\nomega-3 fatty acids generally through\nsupplementation but again can be\naccomplished through Foods as well\ncan also be beneficial for other things\nsuch as mood and indeed there's a whole\nliterature related to effects of\ningesting one to three grams again three\ngrams per day of EPA so that's going to\nrequire\nquite a high intake of Omega-3s in\nwhatever form or supplement you decide\nto take those into your body but that\nthat can improve mood and so forth the\nbasic range that I was able to find in\nthe meta-analysis so meta-analyzes are\nwhere a researcher will look at the\nresults of a bunch of different studies\nfocused on the same thing look at the\ndifferent strength of those studies\nthey'll do all sorts of cool statistical\ngymnastics like remove the most potent\nstudy the one that had the greatest\neffect and see whether or not they're\nstill an effect of some treatment or for\ninstance they will swap in and out\ndifferent studies and different\ncombinations to see whether or not any\none study is really leading to the\nconclusion that a given treatment does\nsomething in any case in the\nmeta-analysis of omega-3 fatty acids for\nthe treatment of headache and that\nincludes all the different kinds of\nheadache\nthey found\nin exploring a huge range of Omega-3\nsupplementation ranging from 200\nmilligrams all the way up to 2 000\nmilligrams per day it really was at the\none gram or higher dosage per day where\nthe significant impact on reducing\nheadache frequency and intensity was\nfound and just very briefly earlier I\nmentioned that not only is omega-3 fatty\nacids supplementation been shown to be\neffective in reducing the frequency and\nintensity of headache in tension type\nand migraine type headache but it's also\nbeen shown to improve outcomes for\npremenstrual syndrome related headaches\nthese are what we refer to earlier as\nhormone-based headaches again\nthe low estrogen low progesterone\nassociated with certain phases of the\nmenstrual cycle as well as other phase\nof the menstrual cycle are often\nassociated with headache in uh study\nentitled effective omega-3 fatty acids\non premenstrual syndrome a systematic\nreview and again meta-analysis what they\nfound and here I'm paraphrasing the\nconclusion was that\nomega-3 fatty acids could yes\neffectively reduce the severity of PMS\nsymptoms and one of the symptoms in\nparticular that they found what that was\nreduced was the pain related symptoms\nassociated with headache and they\nactually had some very nice hypotheses\nas to why that likely would be and in\nfact point out that in earlier studies\nomega-3 fatty acids have actually been\nconsidered as non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs in some cases\nand indeed there are prescription forms\nof omega-3 fatty acids and I highlight\nthat not because I think people need to\nrun out and get the prescription form of\nomega-3 fatty acids they're actually\nquite hard to obtain and quite expensive\nbut because I think oftentimes when\nwe're talking about something like\nomega-3 fatty acids\nthe fact that they are available over\nthe counter in a supplement or by liquid\nor available in food for that matter\nleads many people to conclude that oh\nyou know this is supplementation this is\nsomething that\num you know it's going to have\nrelatively weak or minor impact on\nthings like headache or other health\nmetrics but let's just say that the fact\nthat it exists as a prescription drug\nand its highest potency form at least in\nmy opinion points to the potency of\nomega-3 fatty acids in dealing with\nanalgesic effects that is reducing pain\nand anti-inflammation as well as some of\nthe known cardiovascular improvements\nthat are associated with increasing\nomega-3 fatty acid intake put simply\nOmega-3s are not just something that\ncomes from food or supplements they are\nalso being marketed as prescription\ndrugs so I do think they need to be\nconsidered as quite potent and at least\nas far as these papers that again\ninclude meta-analyzes of many other\npapers and data sets indicate that\nsupplementing with omega-3 fatty acids\nto a point where you're getting above\none gram per day of EPA is not just\ngoing to be beneficial for treating and\nreducing the frequency and intensity of\none particular type of headache but many\ntypes of headaches and when you combine\nhormonal headaches tension headaches and\nmigraine headaches you account for more\nthan 70 percent of the total types of\nheadaches that are out there the effects\nof Omega-3s on cluster headaches and\nsome of the other types of headaches at\nleast to my knowledge have not been\nevaluated\nthere's no reason to think that Omega-3s\nwould not be beneficial for those types\nof headaches but at least as far as the\ndata sets we talked about here are\nconcerned it is clear omega-3 fatty\nacids are going to be a very potent way\nto reduce pain and to reduce\ninflammation in ways that can reduce the\nfrequency and the intensity of different\nkinds of headache before we continue our\ndiscussion about many not commonly known\nand yet very potent treatments for\ndifferent forms of headache I want to\ntouch on a topic we mentioned a little\nbit earlier and also provide a treatment\nthat is in a way to alleviate something\nand that's photophobia and Aura now keep\nin mind that earlier I referred to Aura\nas this sense that something's about to\nhappen that is true and that meaning\nthat is an accurate description of Aura\nbut oftentimes people also come to\nunderstand Aura as the feeling that\nsomething surrounds a given object\nvisually or even that people have a\nsense that something's around them so\nagain this can be a little bit vague but\nthis idea that aura is a sense of\nsomething about to happen or that\nvisually or in an auditory way and or\nmaybe even in kind of a sense that\nsomething is about to happen in a\ncertain environment and the reason I'm\nmaking uh kind of Arc shapes with my\nhands for those of you that are just\nlistening I'm making art shapes with my\nhands is that aura is often described as\nkind of a Halo or a um emanating out\nfrom from one's body or from something\nthat they're looking at again nothing\nspiritual about this in the context of\nthe discussion about migraine and\nheadache but rather many people\nexperience photophobia sometimes with\naura sometimes no and I just want to\ntouch on a couple of the mechanisms by\nwhich aurum photophobia occur and\nmentioned just briefly a pretty well\nestablished way that people can start to\noffset photophobia and again I mentioned\nthat because many people experience\nphotophobia in headache but there are\nalso a number of people that experience\nphotophobia even if they don't have\nintense headaches so photophobia is\npretty common pretty debilitate it\nactually is one of the reasons why\npeople feel not well and need to leave\nwork or not go to school or or leave\nschool these kinds of things or lay in\nbed all day or dim the lights not go\noutside again sunlight being so\ncongruent with health you can imagine\nhow photophobia can lead to all sorts of\nnegative Downstream consequences okay so\nwhat is Aura and what is photophobia the\nexact origins of ARA aren't exactly\nclear but it is generally thought that\nwhat Aura represents is what's called\nspreading depression and this is not\ndepression of one's mood although it can\nbe associated with that this is\ndepression of neuronal activity again\nneurons communicate with one another by\ngenerating electrical impulses that\ntravel down the length of their of their\nso-called axons which are like little\nwires and then they dump\nneurotransmitter out at the so-called\nsynapse and impact the electrical\nactivity of other neurons\ndepression is a electrical or I should\nsay a chemical electrical\nchemoelectrical is the proper term\nphenomenon in which the excitability of\nneurons is reduced so again doesn't have\nanything to do with depression as a mood\nState per se rather it is a reduced\nexcitability of neurons and it's been\nshown in some Imaging studies\nthat aura is associated with a back to\nfront so from the back of the brain to\nfront spreading depression like a wave\nof lowering levels of electrical\nexcitability and because this originates\nin the visual cortex which is in the\nback so that's the part of your brain\nthat is making sense of visual images\ncoming in through the eyes and relayed\nthrough other stations in the brain\nthat people will start to see a kind of\nHalo of light or that they'll start to\nfeel that the light around them is\nliterally surrounding their body or some\nother object or body that they're\nlooking at and then it spreads forward\nin the brain and that's when it tends to\nstretch over into other so-called\nsensory modalities sensory modalities\nbeing things like touch or hearing so\npeople will get the sense that kind of\nseeing something in their periphery of\ntheir Vision then they'll start feeling\nsomething around them there's a sense\nthat something's about to happen so is\nthis spreading wave of depression goes\nfrom Back to Front people experience a\nnumber of these different semi-abstract\nsensory phenomena that we Call Aura okay\nso that's how Aura originates now\nphotophobia is a little bit different\nphotophobia We Now understand because of\nsome beautiful work that was done at\nCliff saper's Lab at Harvard Medical\nSchool and some other Laboratories\nshowing that photophobia originates from\na specific set of neurons in the eye we\ncall these the intrinsically\nphotosensitive melanops and ganglion\ncells which is really just a mouthful of\nnerd speak for neurons in the eye that\nconnect to the brain these so-called\nganglion cells\nthat respond most robustly to bright\nblue light or other shortwavelength\nlight so you've got short wavelength\nlight that is blue and greens or short\nwavelengths and then long wavelet light\nwhich is red or you know it can even be\nout past red will be infrared we don't\ndetect infrared consciously other\nspecies do like pit vipers can see in\nthe infrared they can even heat sense so\nshort wavelength light is going to be\nlight that's that's bright\nblue green it's what's very common in\nfluorescent bulbs that are commonly used\nin household lighting and workplace\nlighting and other forms of artificial\nlighting it's also of course present in\nsunlight sunlight includes a huge range\nof wavelengths including long wavelength\nlight of course you've seen that as the\nReds and oranges in the sunset and so on\nthose intrinsically photosensitive\nretinal ganglion cells in the eye\nrespond best to bright green or blue\nlight and they send connections to a\nbunch of different places in the brain\nincluding the so-called Central\ncircadian clock superchiasmatic nucleus\nthat sets your day night sleep wake\nrhythms this is why I encourage people\nto view sunlight in the morning to set\nthis system in motion to avoid bright\nlight exposure at night\nfrom artificial sources in order to not\nsend wake-up signals from the eye to the\nbrain and then on to the rest of the\nbody but these intrinsically\nphotosensitive retinal ganglion cells\nare also known to connect with other\nareas of the brain many other areas of\nthe brain in fact and one of the\nimportant areas of the brain they\nconnect to as it relates to photophobia\nis an area of a structure called the\nthalamus the thalamus is an egg-like\nstructure that sits in the center of the\nbrain and it serves as a kind of a\nswitchboard like a sensory relay by\nwhich information coming from the eyes\nfrom the ears from The Touch system Etc\nare funneled into different compartments\nin the thalamus and then sent to\ndifferent other areas of the brain so\nthink of it kind of like an\nold-fashioned switchboard\nor\num you could think of it uh sort of like\na in an airport you go uh to a\nparticular\num wing of the airport then you go to a\nparticular gate and so on you're getting\nfunneled progressively through uh\nnarrower narrower channels until you\narrive at your particular plane much in\nthe same way the thalamus has a bunch of\ndifferent entry points\nso it's sensory information coming in\nfrom a bunch of different sources and\nthose sources get routed into\nprogressively narrower and narrower\nfunnels to eventually arrive at the\naccurate place for their function so\nthese intrinsically photosensitive\ngangling cells send connections to a\nsmall but important area of the thalamus\ncalled LP it's denoted L the letter and\nP with lateral posterior thalamus or\nthat I should say it's the lateral\nposterior nucleus of the thalamus for\nuficionados out there and then the\nneurons in that location are going to\nrespond that is they're going to be\nactivated by bright blue light green\nlight or any kind of bright light\noriginating from artificial sources or\nfrom sunlight and the neurons there that\nrespond to that have a very interesting\npattern of connections they send\nconnections up to the so-called sensory\ncortex so a bunch of different layers\nthroughout the cortex that are not\nassociated with visual perception that\nis they're not associated with\nunderstanding that there are shapes and\nContours in the environment but rather\nto neurons that are involved in the\ndetection of pressure pain and other\nforms of sensory information at the\nlevel of what the meninges we talked\nabout the meninges earlier so again\nwhile the brain itself does not have a\nsensory system to detect pain the\ntissues around it do and the tissues\naround those\ntissues that is the stuff around the\nmeninges themselves can respond to pain\nand intracranial pressure is also\nrelayed through the meninges to our\nconscious awareness that there's pain so\nwhat does this mean for photophobia it\nmeans that\nbright blue light and green light and of\ncourse light from sunlight\nwe'll activate these neurons in the eye\nthese intrinsically photosensitive\nganglion cells which then activate the\nlateral posterior neurons LP neurons and\nthose LP neurons communicate with areas\nof the brain that are specifically tuned\nto different sensory phenomena and in\nparticular pain at the level of the\nmeninges and intracranial pressure what\nthis means is that when we have headache\nor if we simply have photophobia on its\nown that bright light is actually the\ntrigger for pain sensing and even the\ncreation of pain at the level of the\nmeninges and intracranial pressure what\ndoes this mean in terms of dealing with\nor treating photophobia well most people\ndeal with photophobia by deciding to\nturn off or dim all the lights and\nsimply getting under the covers or\nwearing a very um low brim hat and\nputting on sunglasses and they want to\nlie down\nand sometimes because uh migraine can be\nassociated with nausea or even vomiting\nand it's severe instances rather but one\nvery simple way to avoid activation of\nthese retinal ganglion cells that would\ntrigger photophobia is that if you are\nstarting to feel like you have a\nmigraine coming on or you have\nphotophobia coming on to shift to using\npatterns of light that are in the longer\nwavelength domain what that means\npractically is Shifting to using very\norange ideally dim but very orange and\nred light now this is not a call for\npeople to go out and invest in expensive\nred light therapies admittedly there are\nsome excellent case uses for red light\ntherapy particularly for acne wound\nhealing even for improving Vision\nespecially in people beyond the age of\n40 for some hormone augmentation we\ntalked all about that in the episode\nthat I did on light and health again you\ncan find that at hubermanlab.com\neverything time stamped what I'm talking\nabout here would be simply having some\nred light bulbs on hand for any time\nthat you need to remain awake but you're\nstarting to experience photophobia these\nred light bulbs can be purchased very in\nexpensively\nyou know as party lights you can buy\nthese online so there is no specific\nneed to get any uh I would say red light\nthat's designed specifically for\nphotophobia or anything that sort you\ncan find the cheapest um red light\navailable out there and those will\nsimply work the idea being that for many\npeople who are experiencing photophobia\nthey want to reduce that feeling of pain\nand pressure in their head experience\nthrough photophobia they also might want\nto stay awake get some work done and do\nthings so operating under red light or I\nshould say living working Etc under red\nlight would allow you to stay awake not\nhave to hide under the covers if you're\nexperiencing photophobia in addition and\nI mentioned this at the beginning of the\nepisode but many people find photophobia\nto be a entry point or a trigger to\nheadache so what happens is they start\nto experience some Aura some onset of\nphotophobia and then the photophobia\nitself leads to this feeling of malaise\nthat then converts into headache and so\nwhile there are not a lot of clinical\ndata on this just yet an emerging idea\nin the realm of headache treatment is\nthe idea that if you can offset some of\nthe early signs you can offset some of\nthat photophobia and aura\nperhaps to the use of dim red lights or\nred lights as I've described a moment\nago then you might be able to reduce the\nprobability that you're going to have a\nmigraine or other type of headache\nentirely so again no need for expensive\nred lights but you can find red lights\nvery easily online and simply have them\non hand or replace the current lights\nthat you have on your nightstand or in\nwhatever room you happen to be in with\nthese red lights these red lights are\nalso I should mention very useful in\nlimiting the amount of cortisol a stress\nhormone that is very healthy for us to\nrelease at high levels early in the day\nin fact viewing sunlight will increase\ncortisol levels it's another reason why\nwhat I'm about to say is relevant to\nphotophobia but if you want to keep\ncortisol levels low in the evening and\nat night and indeed you do and improve\nthe transition to sleep and indeed your\nsleep overall reducing cortisol at\nevening time and at night time is\nextremely beneficial and red lights will\nhelp you accomplish that I talked about\nthat in the episode on light and health\nso the point here is that if you suffer\nfrom photophobia with or without aura\nusing red lights and not simply dimming\nordinary artificial lights or feeling\nthat you have to turn off all lights\nentirely is going to be one relatively\ninexpensive or I should say a very\ninexpensive in some cases because these\nred lights can be found very\ninexpensively online way to be able to\ncontinue with your daily activities at\nleast in an indoor environment\nif you are suffering from photophobia so\nshifting back to ways to reduce the\nintensity and frequency of different\nkinds of headaches we haven't talked so\nmuch about tension headaches\nspecifically so that's what I'd like to\ndo now is you recall tension headaches\nare going to be muscular in origin again\nkeeping in mind that everything's neural\nwhen it comes to pain everything's\nnormal when it comes to everything\nfrankly because every organ and tissue\nsystem in our body is ultimately\ncontrolled by our nervous system but\ntension headaches are often associated\nwith tension of the muscles that are on\nthe skull of the jaw of the neck and can\nbe quite painful for many people and\ndebilitating and the most common\ntreatment for this that most people rely\non that is is to take non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory so things like\nacetaminophen ibuprofen sometimes\naspirin and things of that sort and\noftentimes those can be helpful there\nare a couple things to keep in mind\nhowever the NSAIDs non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs oftentimes will\nwork very well at first but people\nquickly develop a tolerance to them\nmeaning they're going to have to take\nmore and more in order to get the same\neffect and oftentimes they can't take\nmore and more because some of them are\nvery hard on the liver and in addition\nto that some of them can offset some\nother things that you really want so for\ninstance it's now known that non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs can offset some\nof the benefits of exercise and that\nmakes sense because a lot of the\nAdaptive benefits of exercise actually\ncome from experiencing a lot of\ninflammation acute that means you\nactually want inflammation during a\nresistance training workout or even your\nendurance workout but then that\ninflammation triggers an adaptation\nevent or series of adaptation events\nthat leads to Greater strength greater\nspeed more muscle\nmore endurance whatever it is that you\nhappen to be training for so reducing\npain can be good of course but not if\nyou have to take more and more of a\ngiven drug that it has side effects on\nthe liver and can offset the effects of\nexercise and so forth the other issue\nwith non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\nis that many of them simply do not work\nfor many people or again they'll work\nthe first time and the second time but\nthen they stop working they also tend to\nlower body temperature I think most\npeople are aware of this because many of\nthese same drugs are used in order to\nreduce fever but if you are taking\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\nsimply to reduce your headache and your\nlowing core body temperature that can\nhave all sorts of Downstream issues\nrelated to sleep wake Cycles to\nmetabolism to immune system function\nmore generally and on and on for that\nreason\nthere's been quite a lot of exploration\nof alternatives to non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs for the\ntreatment of headache and indeed pain\ngenerally but today we're talking about\nheadache now as it relates to Tension\nHeadache one of the more advanced kind\nof modern treatments that you sometimes\nhear about is Botox right Botox I think\nmost people are familiar with as the\nthing that people get injected into\ntheir face around the eyes or around the\nlips or elsewhere in order to quote\nunquote reduce wrinkles it was\ndiscovered some years ago when Botox\ntreatments were being done for cosmetic\nreasons that it could often be very\neffective for relieving headache if\ninjected into the muscles and the way\nthat it works is that of course Tension\nHeadache involves a tension of the\nmuscles\na kind of a we'll call it clinching or\ncinching up with the muscles but we're\nreally talking about is contraction of\nthe muscles and that's controlled by\nneurons neurons which are neuromuscular\nso neuromuscular neurons that don't form\nsynapses with or connections with other\nneurons they form synapses with muscle\nthey release acetylcholine onto the\nmuscle and that makes the muscle\ncontract this is the way you move the\nlimbs of your body this is also a way\nthe muscles of your head contract and\ncan give you tension type headaches\nBotox\narises from or is rather botulinum\nneurotoxin botulinum neurotoxin is a\ntoxin that's found in canned goods not\nall canned goods of course and what it\ndoes is it it prevents a certain step in\nthe release of so-called\nneurotransmitter in the little packets\nthat they live in which are called\nvesicles little little spheres of\nneurotransmitter live at the end of\nneuron nerve Terminals and are released\nonto the muscle make the muscle contract\nbotulinum neurotoxin Cleaves a\nparticular protein in there for you\naficionados who want to look this up\nit's a really cool mechanism it Cleaves\nsomething called Snap 25. Snap 25 is\ninvolved in the fusion of those little\nspheres with the membrane of the neuron\nand releasing of the neurotransmitter so\nwhen botulinum neurotoxin is present at\nthe nerve muscle interface those nerves\ncannot communicate with the muscle and\nas a consequence the muscles undergo\nkind of flaccid tone they just kind of\nrelax there underneath the skin\nsure wrinkles are relieved but if Botox\nis injected into the muscles themselves\nit can provide long-lasting relief of\ncertain types of headaches in particular\ntension type headaches so while it seems\nlike a bit of an extreme treatment\npeople who suffer very badly from\ntension type headaches due to hyper\ncontraction of the muscles of the\nforehead or around the temples or around\nthe Jaws or the or certain parts of the\nthe neck and the MUSC muscles of the\nneck that encroach on the on the back of\nthe skull\nor that actually connect to the back of\nthe skull can achieve tremendous long\nlasting relief from these Botox\ninjections sometimes for weeks or months\nor even longer people go in for periodic\nuh you know re-ups of Botox it actually\nis quite safe despite the fact that\nbotulinum neurotoxin is quite dangerous\nit's given in very low Doses and given\nlocally so those are the only muscles\naffected so that's how Botox is used to\ntreat headaches and um it's a very\neffective treatment at that of course\nmany people I imagine are interested in\nnot just drug based treatments and not\nBotox type treatments\nfor treating headache but other types of\ntreatments for headache that are of the\nmore so let's call them natural or um\nnon-drug treatments and here we're\nstarting to get into the realm of the\nkind of herbal and oil-based treatments\nfor headache now I confess when I first\nstarted researching this area of\nheadache and treatment for headaches\nthat is\num I found myself approaching it with a\nbit of trepidation because when I\nstarted to hear about essential oils and\nabout herbal medications and things of\nthat sort I thought okay well there'll\nprobably be some effects I mean\nadmittedly we've talked before on this\npodcast about things like apogenin\nepigenin is one of the core components\nof chamomile\nand chamomile is known to make people\nfeel a little bit sleepy and can enhance\nsleep well apogenic and high\nconcentration can indeed augment sleep\nwe talk about this in our sleep tool kit\nby the way we don't just have episodes\nabout sleep master or sleep perfect your\nsleep Etc but if you go to the\nhubermanlab.com website and you go to\nthe menu and you click on newsletter you\ncan scroll down you'll see that we have\na tool kit for sleep this is completely\nzero cost to access you don't even have\nto sign up although if you'd like to\nsign up for future newsletters you can\nget those one of the key components of\nthe toolkit for sleep in addition to\nbehavioral tools and things that are not\nsupplement based is apogenin which is\nthis component from chamomile so the\nidea that certain herbal derivatives or\nherbs or Oils could be very useful for\nimproving symptoms of whatever in this\ncase\nimproving sleep with apogenin is not\nunheard of and in fact the data\ncontinued to be released all the time\nthat many of the things that we think of\nas herbal Etc can actually have quite\npotent effects and so\num while I myself was approaching the\ndiscussion about essential oils and um\nor I should say oils right who's to say\nif they're essential or not oils and\nherbs in the treatment of headache I\nfinished out my research on this\nliterature feeling\num quite I should say uh surprised and\num and as if I need to really check\nmyself a bit because what I found is\nthat there are certain herbs and oils\nfor instance that far outperform\nnon-steroid and anti-inflammatory drugs\nfor the treatment of headache that's\nright there are certain oils that are\navailable over the counter that when\nlooked at in many studies meta-analyzes\nand I'll tell you about one particular\nstudy and a meta-analysis in a moment\nthey show that they can reduce the\nfrequency and intensity of headache in a\nmanner that far outpaces What You\nobserve with non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs with apparently\nnone of the same issues associated with\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs so I\nthink it's really worth paying attention\nto the first of those studies I'd like\nto describe to you is one that has now\nbecome kind of a classic in the\nliterature I should say at least for\nthose that are interested in the\natypical treatments for headache and the\ntitle of this paper is effective\npeppermint and eucalyptus oil\npreparations on neurophysiological and\nexperimental\nalge's metric headache parameters okay\nwhat does that mean well this is an\ninteresting study because rather than\nlook at the effectiveness of peppermint\nand eucalyptus oil and other oils on\nheadache what they did is because they\nwant to look at the mechanisms\nunderlying headache which I confess I\nlove the fact that they want to\nunderstand the neurophysiology and not\njust get subjective ratings of headache\nalthough they did that too but they\nreally want to understand\nhow these oils can impact things like\nmuscular tension or perception of pain\nwhat they did is they recreated headache\nin human subjects by using tightening\ncuffs of the of the head they cut off\nblood supply to certain areas of the\nhead they basically induced headache and\nthen they measured things like the EMG\nthe muscle response at the level of\nelectrophysiology in the muscle and of\ncourse subjective measures of how much\npeople perceive to be in pain or not in\npain I'll give you the broad Contour of\nthe study because I want to make sure\nthat it's the conclusions that come\nthrough most clearly and we will provide\na link to the study in our show note\ncaptions so what they did is they had\npeople use one of four different\npreparations say preparation one which\nincludes some peppermint oil and some\neucalyptus oil and all the details about\nthe amount and the relative percentages\nare in the paper for you to peruse\nonline through the link I mentioned\nbefore so they had four different groups\nthey had one group\napply peppermint oil but that peppermint\noil also contained eucalyptus oil they\nhad another group used just peppermint\noil they had another group use just tiny\ntraces of peppermint oil and smaller\ndoses of eucalyptus oil and then they\nhad a fourth group which was just using\nPlacebo when I say using what they were\ndoing is they were sponge applying the\noil to the temples and forehead of\npeople and then what they did is they\nused these different approaches to\nmeasure the activation of muscles to\nmeasure pain and they then induced head\npain they induced headache so and they\nlooked at the temporal muscles on the\nside they looked at forehead muscles\nthings of that sort so they used three\ndifferent types of pain stimuli they\nlooked at people's sensitivity to\nexperimentally induced Pain by either\nproviding pressure so this was kind of a\ncuff around the forehead\nor thermal pain so they actually had\nthem basically heat heat it up at the\nlevel of the skin and actually they\nbrought the heat up pretty high to the\npoint where people were rating the pain\nalmost to the to the point of um\nexcessive pain and pain limits so they\nobviously couldn't take them to the\npoint of extreme pain and they had a\nconstriction type condition in which\nthey cut off blood circulation to the\npericranial muscles using an inflatable\ncollar around the cranium and they\ninflated that to pretty high pressure so\nkind of a brutal experiment to be\ninvolved in but look they're trying to\nmimic headache and I think by using\nthese different approaches they're able\nto mimic the different aspects of\nheadache and make sure and here's the\nkey point that every person in the study\nis not just getting the same treatment\nfor headache but is getting the same\nheadache and that's something that I\nthink gives this study power it's not\nthe only way to do a study like this but\nit gives it a lot of power in trying to\nunderstand which types of interventions\nare going to assist in headache and\nmaybe even specific dimensions of the\npain and headache and basically what\nthey found in the study is that of all\nthe treatments they used the essential\nplant oil preparations that contained\npeppermint\nand I'll just mention as an aside and in\nother studies Menthol so these minty\ntype uh essential minty type\num what we think of as flavors but are\nreally Aromas as well and as I'll point\nout the mechanism in a moment they have\nthe effect of significantly reducing the\nintensity of the pain that is subjects\ncould tolerate the pain far better and\nexperienced less pain subjectively and\nthe magnitude of the effects were really\npretty impressive again I went into all\nthis thinking essential oils okay that's\nlike some really woo stuff\num you know I don't know about that but\nit turns out that these essential oils\nat least the ones that contain\npeppermint oil with or without\neucalyptus oil performed very well in\nreducing pain the key takeaway from the\nstudy is and here I'm paraphrasing from\nthe study of that the combination of\npeppermint oil eucalyptus oil and these\nare basically in a ethanol suspension\nagain people are not drinking these\nessential oils I want to be very clear\nthey're applying these to the to the\nskin\naround the area that's in pain and\nparticularly the temple and the\nforeheads\nincreased cognitive performance I didn't\ntalk about that but this is the ability\nto maintain cognitive functioning while\nin pain you know here we're talking\nabout headache up until now just as kind\nof pain but that pain can be very\ndebilitating for your ability to work\nand perform and do other things so this\ncombination of peppermint oil and\neucalyptus oil applied to the skin allow\npeople to increase their cognitive\nperformance while under pain and had a\nvery muscle relaxing\nand mentally relaxing effect mental\nrelaxation was of course measured\nsubjectively but remember one of the\nthings that led me to feature this study\nin this episode in particular is that\nthey didn't just say oh my muscles feel\nmore relaxed they actually saw that the\nmuscles of the forehead and temples and\nsome surrounding muscles were more\nrelaxed when people had these oils on\napplied to their forehead and the\ntemples not perhaps to the same degree\nthat one would observe with botox or for\nthe same extent or duration as one would\nexperience with botox but much in the\nsame way which then raises the question\nof what's going on here I mean is this\nall placebo effect well no because they\ncompared to Placebo and they controlled\nfor the odor of course of the oil that\nwas applied so that everyone thought\nthat they were getting\nessentially the same thing pun intended\nbut in this case what they found is that\nif they applied the essential oil to the\nforehead and temples that people\nexperience a more or less a cooling\nsensation or they could feel as if\nsomething was happening in the\nunderlying muscle well what was\nhappening we now know that Menthol\npeppermint and other things that smell\nthat way and taste that way actually\nhave an impact on the sensory neurons at\nthe level of the skin and can actually\ninhibit certain Sensory neurons and can\nactivate other Sensory neurons okay so\nin order to understand this we have to\ngo back to what I said at the beginning\nof the episode which is that you have\nmotor neurons these are neurons that\nconstrict muscles or excuse me that\ncause contraction of muscles\nstrict them they cause contraction of\nmuscles you have Sensory neurons which\nsense different things light sound or\ntouch and you have modulatory neurons\nMenthol and Eucalyptus are actually\nknown to activate certain channels in\nthe sensory neurons that respond not\njust a touch but also the sensation of\ncooling okay so when we think of Menthol\nand peppermint we think of kind of cool\nscents and flavors cool meaning cold\nand when we think of things like hot\npeppers capsaicin we think of anything\nthat has a hot temperature we tend to\nthink of spicy so spicy and hot go\ntogether and peppermint and menthol\nand cool go together much in the way\nthat the gum commercials or the mint\ncommercials would lead you to believe\nand in fact they're right so what's\nhappening here is that the application\nof these oils is very likely activating\nchannels in the sensory neurons\nincluding the trip channels but others\nas well that are leading to the analges\neffect by shutting down the heat and\npain Pathways because heat and pain\nwhile they're not exactly the same in\nour nervous system they are funneled\nthrough common Pathways whereas Cooling\nand Pain Relief are funneled through\nalternate what we call parallel Pathways\nso the study on peppermint and\neucalyptus oil preparations in reducing\npain of headache and different aspects\nof pain due to headache I think are\nreally important because they don't just\nillustrate the fact that yes indeed and\nyou know going record saying it because\nthat's what the data say and there are\nother papers to support this statement\nas well essential oils applied to the\nskin can reduce the symptoms of tension\nheadache in a significant way and\nactually can lead to some offset of some\nof the cognitive\ndefects seen with headaches so that's\nitself very impressive I must say\nsurprising for me kind of put me in my\nplace as somebody thought oh essential\noils is going to be like okay but it's\nactually seemed to um really hold some\nMerit and when you compare the magnitude\nof the effect even though this was an\nenormous number of subjects you compare\nthe magnet to the effect in a paper like\nthis or similar papers on these\nessential oils to the impact of\nnon-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs and\nthey really hold their own and in some\ncases exceed the positive impact of\nanti-inflammatory drugs so for that\nreason I think we can look at peppermint\noils and peppermint and Eucalyptus\ncontaining oils Menthol containing oils\napplied to the skin for the treatment of\ntension type headache as um among the\nmore potent treatments available out\nthere now another way to approach\ntreatment of tension headache is\nsomething that many of you have probably\nheard about before\nand then I've talked a little bit about\non this podcast in previous episodes and\nthat's acupuncture we will do an entire\nepisode all about acupuncture but much\nin the same way that essential oils I\nthink for many people not all but for\nmany people are considered kind of a woo\nbiology or people think of it as a very\nalternative medicine keep in mind that\nas the underlying mechanisms of things\nlike these peppermint oils are starting\nto be discovered or Omega-3s are\nstarting to be discovered\nmechanistically they hold up very well\nthere's a logic there there's an\nunderlying understanding of not just why\nthey should work but in many cases how\nthey work in the same way acupuncture\nwhich of course has existed for\nthousands of years has been used very\nsuccessfully to treat headache and other\nforms of pain so much so that many\ninsurance companies will now pay for\nacupuncture as an insured practice not\nall but many will and in addition to\nthat\nthe scientific Community is starting to\nunderstand mechanistically how\nacupuncture works so I don't want to\nmake this the major Focus for now\nbut\nvery briefly there's a laboratory at\nHarvard Medical School run by chufuma\nchufu is well known in the Neuroscience\nCommunity for doing excellent work in\nparsing the mechanisms of touch\nsensation and pain in particular so not\njust touch at the level of skin but pain\nand pain Pathways and in recent years\nhis laboratory has started to do studies\non how acupuncture works because indeed\nacupuncture has been known to work to\nalleviate pain for a long time but the\nunderlying mechanisms haven't been clear\nwhat chufu's lab has published now in\nexcellent journals like nature science\nand other journals is that the precise\ninsertion sites of different needles\nlead to activation of sensory neurons\nand their Downstream Pathways in ways\nthat can potently reduce inflammation\nand that can be used to potently reduce\nthe activity of certain muscles\nfor instance muscles in the forehead and\ntemples so when you hear acupuncture can\nreduce pain I think some people think oh\nwell if there's needles sticking out of\nyour face first of all that must hurt\nand actually the needles are very fine\nneedles and skilled acupuncturists can\ninsert them without any pain or actually\nthe person receiving it doesn't even\nusually recognize that the needles are\nin that's how quickly and efficiently\nthey can put them in and people don't\ndetect any pain but that has been shown\nto greatly reduce pain in particular\nheadache related pain and back-related\npain in some other forms of pain chufu's\nlab has shown that the specific needle\ninsertion sites can activate the sensory\nPathways and can deactivate the sensory\nmotor pathways and now you're familiar\nwith Sensory neurons motor neurons and\nmodulatory neurons and can modulate the\nactivity of the pain Pathways by way of\nimpacting the activity of all sorts of\ndifferent organs including organs that\ngive rise to some of the inflammatory\ncytokines so basically what I'm saying\nhere is that thanks to thousands of\nyears of acupuncture and the maps of\ndifferent insertion sites we now know or\nI should say people have long known and\npeople in the west are starting to adopt\nthe understanding that acupuncture yes\nindeed it really does work for relieving\npain and Laboratories both in the United\nStates such as chufus and elsewhere are\nstarting to find the underlying\nmechanisms and those mechanisms include\ndeactivation of the pain Pathways\nactivation of some of the parallel\nPathways that assist in shutting down\npain or in relaxing the muscles that are\ncausing tension type headache as well as\nactivation of neural Pathways that\nimpinge on organs that then cause or\nreduce the release of molecules into the\nbody that give us the experience of pain\nso reduced inflammation and in many\ncases increasing anti-inflammatory\nPathways so I just want to be sure to\nmention acupuncture and a little bit of\nmechanistic understanding of why\nacupuncture works because indeed\nacupuncture is shown to be quite\neffective for the treatment of tension\ntype headache and to some extent\nmigraine headache as well so we talked\nabout omega-3 fatty acids we talked\nabout essential oils we talked about\nacupuncture\nso this episode is starting to sound\nlike alternative treatments to headache\nincluding migraine but I want to be very\nclear this is not about alternative\ntreatments everything that I'm talking\nabout here has a mechanistic basis and\nwhat we're talking about today are\napproaches to dealing with headache that\nyes are typically over-the-counter\ncompounds or are grounded in nutrition\nor in the case of acupuncture behavioral\npractices\nbut that are not necessarily meant as\nreplacements for things like non-steroid\ninflammatory drugs or prescription drugs\nof course those things can still be\ntaken many people derive benefit from\nthem but the goal is always I believe I\nshould hope for people to find ways that\nthey can control their health outcomes\nand reduce things like headache using a\nminimum number of things that have other\nside effects and that of course can also\ninclude the use of essential oils in\nconjunction with things like non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs or the use of\nred light to offset photophobia in\nconjunction with any number of different\ntreatments either prescription or\notherwise so I do want to make that\nclear and I especially want to make that\nclear as I transition to the next\nsegment where I'm going to tell you\nabout herbal treatments for migraine and\nthis is based on what I consider a very\ncomprehensive review of many randomized\ncontrol studies indeed the title of the\npaper is herbal treatments for migraine\na systematic review of randomized\ncontrolled studies and this was\npublished in 2020 and this contains an\nimmense amount of information so we will\nprovide a link to it for those of you\nthat really want to dive deep on this in\nthis paper they focus on a number of\ndifferent reviews and Analysis of data\nfocused on compounds for the treatment\nof migraine ranging from and including\nthings like Menthol and peppermint oil\nso we already covered that so I won't\ncover that again in detail but in this\nreview they highlight the results I\nrefer to before plus other results that\nshow that Menthol and peppermint oil can\nbe quite effective in the treatment of\ntension type headache and in this case\nmigraine headache as well so that's\ninteresting that Menthol and peppermint\noils can be used not just to treat\ntension type headaches but\nmigraine headaches as well and they look\nat an enormous number of other types of\nherbal and essential oil type treatments\neverything from coriander to Citron to\ndamask Rose chamomile lavender a bunch\nof things so I'm not going to go through\neach and every one of these in a lot of\ndetail what I've tended to do today and\nI'm going to do now is to highlight the\nmost potent\nof these different treatments again\nMenthol peppermint oil being among the\nmost potent in addition to that there's\na particular pathway that's associated\nwith headache and when I say that I mean\nthe different types of headache which\nincludes the activation of this thing\nthat we call cgrp cgrp again is involved\nin this calcium regulation pathway and\nleads to vasodilation\nof the vessels and arteries and\ncapillaries in a way that can create\npain and this feeling of pressure inside\nthe head which can be very uncomfortable\nof course\nnow earlier in the episode I mentioned\nthat I was going to touch on caffeine\nand so I'm going to do that now now the\nreason I mention caffeine is that\nthere's a sort of lore out there that if\nyou have a headache drinking a cup of\ncoffee can eliminate that headache a few\nthings about that point first of all if\nyou are somebody who ingests caffeine\nevery day and you do not ingest caffeine\nyou will indeed get a headache and\ndrinking caffeine will relieve that\nparticular headache so it's absolutely\ntrue that caffeine can relieve the lack\nof caffeine induced headache that's sort\nof a duh but that leads actually to a\nvery important question which is why\nwould that be the case well it turns out\nthat caffeine is both a vasodilator and\na vasoconstrictor\nhow does it do that well one of the main\nways in which caffeine makes us more\nalert is that it occupies The receptors\nfor something called adenosine adenosine\nis a molecule that builds up in the\nbrain and body more and more the longer\nwe've been awake it's one of the things\nthat makes us feel sleepy\nso when we drink caffeine that caffeine\noccupies the adenosine receptor and the\nadenosine cannot have its normal effect\nof making us sleepy when that caffeine\nwears off the adenosine combine and we\nfeel sleepy adenosine is a vasodilator\nso when we drink caffeine because it\nblocks the effects of adenosine there is\na vasoconstriction associated with\ndrinking caffeine so if you have a\nheadache that is associated with\nexcessive vasodilation and pressure in\nthe head indeed drinking some caffeine\ncan cause some vasoconstriction by\npreventing that adenosine pathway that\nwould normally lead to vasoconstriction\nand you can get some relief from that\nheadache however caffeine is also a\nvasodilator caffeine has the ability to\nimpinge on the so-called no pathway the\nnitric oxide pathway which is a nerve to\nblood pathway that involves a few\ndifferent enzymes that we won't get into\nright now but maybe in a future episode\nthat causes dilation of the blood\nvessels and as a consequence drinking\ncaffeine can also increase vasodilation\nso it's sort of a two-pronged effect now\none of the ways in which you might think\nabout this and perhaps utilize this is\nthat if you are well rested or if it's\nearly in the day and you've had some\nsleep the previous night adenosine\nlevels are very likely to be low\nespecially if you slept very well the\nnight before\nunder those conditions when you ingest\ncaffeine you are not going to experience\nthe vasoconstriction effects of caffeine\nthat would ordinarily be there by\ninhibiting adenosine why because\nadenosine is not present at all and\nunder those conditions drinking coffee\nought to lead to some vasodilation not a\nlot but nonetheless vasodilation if\nhowever you haven't slept well or it's\nlate in the day and you've been up for a\nlong time drinking caffeine is likely to\nhave more of a vasoconstriction effect\nand this is important because some of\nthe treatments that you hear about that\ninvolve using caffeine to treat headache\nare as Extreme as okay if you have a\nheadache at night drink a cup of coffee\nand then go to sleep I actually saw that\nin the literature which I couldn't quite\nbelieve because yes indeed some people\ncan fall asleep after drinking caffeine\nbut we know very well thanks to the\nbeautiful work and science\nCommunications of people like Dr Matthew\nWalker from University of California\nBerkeley and who's been a guest on this\nand many other podcasts that even if you\ncan fall asleep after drinking caffeine\ningesting caffeine within the 10 to 12\nhours prior to bedtime is simply not a\ngood idea because of the ways it\ndisrupts the architecture of sleep so\nwhat's the takeaway about caffeine and\nheadache and vasodil relation you need\nto be very clear on whether or not\ncaffeine tends to remove your headache\nor exacerbate it now this is going to\ndepend on time of day and the amount of\nadenosine in your system as I mentioned\nbefore but also there seems to be a kind\nof bimodal distribution whereby some\npeople when they drink caffeine it\nreally improves their headache and so in\nsome cases a very significant effects\nwhereas other people when they drink\ncaffeine it really exacerbates their\nheadache and as at least as far as I\ncould tell from the literature it's not\neasy to predict who those people are\ngoing to be what is reassuring however\nis it does not seem to be the case that\nif you're somebody who experiences\nrelief from headaches by drinking\ncaffeine that suddenly\none day to the next you're going to\nexperience a worsening of your headache\nand vice versa is also true so if you're\nsomebody that drinks caffeine and your\nheadaches get worse I don't think\nthere's any reason to think that\ncaffeine one day or from one day to the\nnext rather is going to somehow\nalleviate your headache so you have to\ndetermine for yourself whether or not\nheadaches are relieved or exacerbated by\ndrinking caffeine and if you're\nwondering why it's so confusing it's\nbecause caffeine hits both the\nvasodilation and the vasoconstriction\nPathways and there's nothing you or I or\nanyone else can do about it now the last\nthing I'd like to talk about in terms of\nrelief for headaches is something that\nI'm guessing about probably 25 percent\nof you are familiar with and 75 percent\nof you are not which is curcumin\ncurcumin is often also referred to as\nturmeric and turmeric is a root and\ncurcumin is one of the key components of\nthat root curcumin is known to have very\npotent anti-inflammatory properties\nI don't think that's debated at all in\nfact it's so potent as an\nanti-inflammatory that some people have\ncautioned against taking high levels of\ncurcumin prior to for instance\nresistance training workouts or even\ncardiovascular workouts because it so\nprevents inflammation that it also can\nprevent the adaptation response because\nremember the inflammation that occurs\nduring exercise both resistance and\ncardiovascular exercise is at least in\npart\nthe trigger for the adaptation that it's\ngoing to lead to enhanced endurance\nenhanced strength hypertrophy Etc\nnonetheless curcumin has been explored\nin the context of treatment of migraine\nand it's one of the compounds that was\nanalyzed in extensive detail in this\nwonderful review that I mentioned a\nlittle bit earlier what I like about\nthis study is that they were able to\nexplore the effects of curcumin as\nexplored in previous research studies\nand compare those across a large range\nof different dosages and a large range\nof combinations with other things like\ncoenzyme Q10 which we've talked about on\nthis podcast before but I think for sake\nof this discussion just really focusing\non what curcumin does alone or in\nconjunction with the omega-3 fatty acids\nis what turns out to be the most\ninteresting first of all curcumin has\nbeen shown to be generally safe for most\npeople at dosages as high as 8 000\nmilligrams per day or eight grams per\nday now I want to be very clear I do not\nrecommend that anyone take dosages of\ncurcumin an AKA turmeric that are that\nhigh why well\ncurcumin and turmeric not only are\nanti-inflammatory but they also can\nimpinge on other Pathways in particular\nhormonal Pathways and in fact curcumin\nAKA turmeric can alter the synthesis of\nsomething called dihydrotestosterone\ndihydrotestosterone is involved in an\nenormous range of different bodily\nfunctions it's involved in libido it's\ninvolved in Men in beard growth and in\nthe regulation of a number of different\ntissues both in the reproductive axis\nand outside the reproductive axis and\ncurcumin is a potent inhibitor of DHT so\nI do want to caution that people who\ntake high doses of curcumin and some\npeople who are very sensitive to\ncurcumin will even at low doses\nexperience reductions in DHT that lead\nto things that they would not like such\nas sufficient reductions in libido\nhowever curcumin has been shown to be\neffective as an anti-inflammatory and\nhas been shown to be very effective in\ntreating different types of headache and\nparticular migraine headache one of the\nways in which curcumin does that is to\ninhibit this thing that I talked about a\nfew minutes ago which is nitric oxide or\nno which causes vasodilation and in\ndoing that can reduce the feeling that\none has a lot of intracranial pressure\nokay so curcumin dosages come in\nenormous range as I mentioned before\ndosages that range anywhere from 80\nmilligrams taken\n80 milligrams per day that is taken for\neight weeks time that's been examined\nit's been explored at 80 milligram\ndosages taken alongside two and a half\ngrams of omega-3 fatty acids or omega-3\nfatty acids alone\nand against Placebo and the general\nconclusion of these studies is that\ncurcumin when taken it at dosages of\nabout 80 milligrams although for those\nof you very sensitive to curcumin\nprobably as low as 25 or even 50\nmilligrams per day in conjunction with\nalthough not necessarily at the same\ntime but taken daily alongside\nomega-3 fatty acids at two and a half\ngrams per day led to significant\nimprovements in migraine and other forms\nof headache meaning both the frequency\nand the intensity of the headaches that\noccurred was greatly reduced one\nimportant point about curcumin to keep\nin mind is that curcumin is known to\ninhibit something called cytochrome p450\nthat's associated with an enzymatic\npathway and some other things that\nrelate to blood coagulation so for\npeople that are taking medications that\nare anticoagulants to prevent clotting\nyou do need to be very cautious about\nusing curcumin and of course with\ncurcumin or any other supplement you\nshould always talk to your doctor prior\nto including it or removing it from your\nsupplement regimen so as you can see\nthere are a number of different things\nthat in addition to prescription drugs\nand over-the-counter pain medications\nthings like non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs can really\nimpact the different aspects of headache\nand different types of headache in some\ncases differentially now today we talked\nmainly about tension type and migraine\ntype headaches because those are the\nmost common forms of headache there are\nof course the cluster type headaches\nthat are of neural origin talked about\nhormonal headaches and indeed some\ntreatments such as Omega-3s which have\nbeen shown to be beneficial for\noffsetting the menstrual related\nheadaches now in the context of the\ndiscussion about Omega-3s keep in mind\nthat Omega-3s can be obtained from\nsupplementation or from nutrition so you\ndon't necessarily have to take omega-3\ncapsules or liquid form Omega-3s if you\nwant to use Omega-3s to Target different\nsymptoms of headache but that probably\nis going to be the most efficient way to\ndo it given that many foods do contain\nOmega threes but it's hard to get above\nthat one gram dosage and in fact most of\nthe studies that we talked about today\ninvolved getting two or even two and a\nhalf or in some cases on this podcast\nwith previous guests such as Dr Rhonda\nPatrick she talked about the advantages\nof getting as high as three grams of\nOmega-3s per day which almost with\ncertainty is going to require some\nexternal form of supplementation even\nfor those of you that are making a point\nto eat fatty ocean fish with the skin on\nso I just want to make sure that I\nhighlight that before we wrap up I can't\nhelp myself but to talk about something\nthat I heard about on the news several\nyears ago and it sounded too outrageous\nto be true but then was confirmed as\naccurate by one of my neurologist\ncolleagues that's the fact that eating\ncertain very spicy peppers can induce\nheadache and in some cases can induce\nbrain damage and bear with me here I'm\nnot talking about your traditional\njalapeno and I'm acknowledging the fact\nthat certain people can tolerate far\nmore spicy taste case then do others\nsome people are very sensitive to spicy\nsome people can tolerate very spicy food\nand that one can build up a tolerance to\nspicy food by ingesting progressively\nyour spicy or excuse me spicy or and\nspicier Foods over time\nnonetheless there are these Pepper\neating contests out there that um while\nnot very common do exist and people\nchallenge each other to eat peppers of\num extreme spiciness and there's one in\nparticular that's referred to as the\nCarolina Reaper by the way that's not a\nperson as far as I know that's a pepper\nthe Carolina Reaper which is known to\nhave the most potent spice of any pepper\nand here's why you would not want to eat\nthe Carolina Reaper a few years ago at\none of these Pepper eating contests man\nate a Carolina Reaper as part of the\ncompetition and suddenly experience\nwhat's called Thunderclap headache\nThunderclap headache is a unique type of\nheadache very different from all the\nother types of headaches it is not from\nthe surface in so it's not tension\nheadache it's not even the cluster type\nheadache of the nerve activation of the\ntrigeminal it's actually a hyper\nconstriction of the vasculature in the\nbrain caused by the ingestion of the\npepper and inflammatory response and\nremember that heat and spicy go together\nin these neural Pathways and a bunch of\ndifferent heat related and spice related\nPathways get activated simultaneously\nwhen one ingests something of extreme\nspice and the blood vessels and indeed\nsome of the smaller arteries feeding\nneural tissue shut down and he\nexperienced this Thunderclap headache\nwhich is a brutal headache and sadly in\nhis case um permanent brain damage so\nloss of neuronal tissue because neuronal\ntissue is very metabolically active you\ncut off the blood supply to that tissue\nNot only would you feel miserable maybe\neven pass out but lose vision and\ncertain brain areas will actually die\noff in the absence of blood flow to\nthose areas we know this more commonly\nas stroke so I don't want to strike fear\nin anybody about eating a you know a\njalapeno or even a very spicy meal from\ntime to time but if you're not somebody\nwho's familiar with eating very spicy\nfoods you certainly don't want to enter\none of these competitions and just\nrealize that the pathways from Menthol\nand cool or spicy and hot those aren't\njust subjective Pathways these are\nactually neural Pathways that again\noriginate in our so-called nerds call it\nthe sensory epithelium so our skin our\nour hearing our eyes and that feed that\ninformation into the body to make use of\nthat information some case motor\nmovement so sensory motor in other cases\nthe information can be fed through nerve\nPathways that goes to the vasculature\nand causes the vasculature to either\ndilate or constrict these very spicy\npeppers causing as I just mentioned\nextreme cerebro of of the head of\nvasoconstriction and brain damage again\nthat's not going to be a common thing\nout there but nonetheless I encourage\npeople to be very cautious about the\nCarolina Reaper so today we talked about\nheadaches and first we highlighted the\ndifferent types of headache making it\nclear that understanding which headache\nyou might be experiencing\ncan be very beneficial for understanding\nwhich sorts of treatments ought to be\nbest and perhaps also best avoided in\ntrying to alleviate those headaches or\nprevent them from happening at all we\ntalked about tension headaches migraine\nheadaches hormone-based headaches\ncluster headaches and traumatic brain\ninjury related headaches we talked about\ndifferent types of treatments ranging\nfrom creatine to omega-3 fatty acid\nsupplementation some herbal and indeed\nsome essential oil treatments as well as\nacupuncture all of which have been shown\nto have significant impact in reducing\nthe frequency and intensity of headaches\nand in many cases reductions in the\nfrequency and intensity of headaches\nthat are at least as great as the\nresults they're seen with non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs again I want to\nhighlight that none of these approaches\nare necessarily designed to be done on\ntheir own or in replacement of\nprescription drugs from your physician\nthere are excellent prescription drugs\nout there that your physician can\nprescribe for you for the treatment of\nheadache nonetheless I think many people\nwho are listeners of this podcast are\ninterested in the things that they can\ndo in order to inoculate themselves or\nat least reduce the likelihood of\nexperiencing headache especially for\npeople who are experiencing chronic\nrecurring headaches such as
