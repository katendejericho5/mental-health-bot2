    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today my\nguest is Dr Sarah Gottfried Dr Sarah\nGottfried is an obstetrician\ngynecologist who did her undergraduate\ntraining in bioengineering at the\nUniversity of Washington in Seattle she\nthen completed her medical training at\nHarvard Medical School and she currently\nis a clinical professor of Integrative\nMedicine and nutritional Sciences at\nThomas Jefferson University she has also\nbeen a clinician treating men and women\nin various aspects of Hormone Health and\nLongevity for more than 20 years\nshe is an expert in not just traditional\nmedicine as it relates to hormones and\nfertility but also nutritional practices\nsupplementation and behavioral practices\nand combining all of that expertise in\norder to help women navigate every\naspect and dimension of their hormones\nlongevity and vitality ranging from\npuberty to Young adulthood adulthood\nperimenopause and menopause and nowadays\nshe's also treating men across the\nlifespan in terms of longevity vitality\nand Hormone Health during today's\ndiscussion Dr Gottfried shares an\nenormous amount of information and tools\nthat women can apply toward their\nHormone Health fertility vitality and\nlongevity we discussed the gut\nmicrobiome which many people have heard\nabout but Dr Godfrey points out the\nspecific needs that women have in terms\nof managing their gut microbiome and the\nways that that influences things like\nestrogen levels and Metabolism\ntestosterone thyroid and growth hormone\nand much more we also discussed\nnutrition and exercise we touch on how\nthe omega-3 fatty acids play a\nparticularly important role in managing\nfemale hormone Health Dr Gottfried\npoints out why women have particular\nneeds when it comes to essential fatty\nacids and how best to obtain those\nessential fatty acids for Hormone Health\nwe also discuss exercise and she offers\nsome surprising information about the\ntypes and ratios of resistance training\nto cardiovascular training that women\nought to use in order to maximize their\nHormone Health\nwe also talk a lot about the digestive\nsystem this was a surprising aspect of\nthe conversation I did not anticipate Dr\nGottfried shared with us for instance\nthat women suffer from digestive issues\nat more than 10 times the frequency that\ndo men and fortunately that there are\ntools specific to women that they can\nuse in order to overcome those digestive\nissues and that in overcoming those\ndigestive issues they can overcome many\nof the related hormone issues that so\nmany women face Dr Gottfried also shares\nwith you tremendous knowledge about the\nspecific types of tests not just blood\ntests but also urine and microbiome\ntests that women can use in order to\nreally get a clear understanding of\ntheir hormone status not just of present\nbut also where the trajectory of their\nhormones is taking them so we have an\navid discussion about puberty about\nyoung adulthood adulthood perimenopause\nand how best to manage and navigate\nperimenopause and menopause including a\ndiscussion about hormone replacement\ntherapy in addition to her academic and\nclinical expertise Dr Gottfried has\nauthored many import important books on\nnutrition hormones and supplementation\nas it relates to women and to people\ngenerally the two books that I'd like to\nhighlight and that we've provided links\nto in the show note captions are women\nfood and hormones and the hormone cure I\nread the hormone cure and found it to be\ntremendously interesting and informative\nnot just in terms of teaching me about\nfemale hormone health and various\ntreatments for female hormone Health but\nalso as a man trying to understand how\nthe endocrine system interacts with\nmindset nutrition and supplementation\nmore generally so I highly recommend the\nhormone cure for anybody interested in\nhormones and Hormone Health and women\nfood and hormones in particular for\nwomen although again both books are\ngoing to be strongly informative for\nwomen wishing to optimize their Hormone\nHealth vitality and Longevity before we\nbegin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools to the\ngeneral public in keeping with that\ntheme I'd like to thank the sponsors of\ntoday's podcast cast our first sponsor\nis Roka Roka makes eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that are the absolute highest\nquality I spent a lifetime working on\nthe biology of the visual system and I\ncan tell you that your visual system has\nto contend with an enormous number of\nchallenges in order for you to be able\nto see clearly so for instance when you\ngo from a very brightly lit area to a\ndimlet area your visual system has to\nmake all sorts of adjustments that allow\nyou to still see your environment Roca\neyeglasses and sunglasses were built\nwith the biology of the visual system in\nmind so no matter what environment\nyou're in you'll be able to see with\nperfect clarity and they have terrific\nAesthetics an enormous number of choices\nin terms of Aesthetics so unlike a lot\nof so-called performance eyeglasses out\nthere that only give you the option to\nwear the ones that make you look like a\ncyborg they have those options but they\nalso have a lot of options with\nAesthetics that you would be perfectly\ncomfortable wearing to work or to dinner\nor anywhere else if

neuroscientist I\ncan tell you there is no neural circuit\nin the brain for being smart thesis\nunderstands this and has designed\ndifferent nootropics in order to bring\nyour brain into specific States for\nspecific types of work so for instance\nfor Creative work or to engage with more\nFocus or to give you more energy for\ncognitive or physical work so with\nthesis they'll design custom nootropics\nfor you that will allow you more focus\nbetter task switching more creativity\nand so on and they'll be sure to include\nonly the ingredients that you want and\nnot the ingredients that you don't I've\nbeen using thesis for more than a year\nnow and I can confidently say that their\nneutropics have been a total game\nchanger for me I like the clarity\nformula prior to Long bouts of

today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by element element is\nan electrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans the exact ratios of electrolytes\nare an element and those are sodium\nmagnesium and potassium but it has no\nsugar I've talked many times before on\nthis podcast about the key role of\nhydration and electrolytes for nerve\ncell function neuron function as well as\nthe function of all the cells and all\nthe tissues and organ systems of the\nbody\nif we have sodium magnesium and\npotassium present in the proper ratios\nall of those cells function properly and\nall our bodily systems can be optimized\nif the electrolytes are not present and\nif hydration is low we simply can't\nthink as well as we would otherwise our\nmood is off hormone systems go off our\nability to get into physical action to\nengage in endurance and strength and all\nsorts of other things is diminished so\nwith element you can make sure that\nyou're staying on top of your hydration\nand that you're getting the proper\nratios of electrolytes if you'd like to\ntry element you can go to drink element\nthat's lmnt.com huberman and you'll get\na free element sample

very excited to\nask you about an enormous number of\ntopics here we are expert in so so many\nthings so uh the challenge for me is\ngoing to be to constrain this walk as it\nwere but I'm hoping that we can touch on\na great number of things today the first\nof which\nis really about\nhormones and female hormones in\nparticular and I have a question which\nis\nis it ever informative for a woman\nregardless of age to know something\nabout\nher mother's perhaps even her\ngrandmother's experience vis-a-vis\nhormones not just pregnancy\nchallenges with or\num ease with pregnancy and child rearing\nchildbirth this sort of thing but you\nknow what sorts of conversations should\nwomen be having with themselves and with\nfamily members to get a window into what\ntheir specific needs might be love this\nquestion\nso my work is really at the interface\nbetween genetics and environment so your\nquestion gets to\nboth\nand I think it's essential that you\nunderstand\nwhat your\ngrandmother went through I'd even say\nyour great grandmother depending on\nlongevity in your family so I grew up\nwith my great-grandmother I get that\nand especially your mother\nso\nI would probably start first with trauma\nan intergenerational trauma because I\nthink that affects the endocrine system\nso hugely especially cortisol signaling\nbut\nthe broader Pine system\npsychoimmunuroendocrine system\nand then there's you know if I think\nabout\nthe stages the life cycle that a woman\ngoes through\nif you think about puberty I think I\ndon't know how\ngenetically determine the age of puberty\nis certainly there's a lot of\nenvironmental influences like toxins can\naffect it\nbut\num pregnancy\nthe age at which you start to go through\nperimenopause menopause many of those\nhave a genetic component\nso with pregnancy I mean you can\ncertainly think\nthe shape of the pelvis your ability to\nhave a vaginal birth\nsome of that is genetically determined I\nmean you do have you know the the sperm\ndonor affecting some of that but you\nknow in my family for instance we have\nno cesarean sections so everyone goes\nthrough this process of a relatively\neasy vaginal birth I was a forceps baby\nbut you know for the most part\num you can find out about that and then\nthere's certain female conditions that\nhave a very strong component genetically\nmost of which run in my family so that\nincludes endometriosis\nfibroids I just had a hysterectomy I\nadded 50 plus fibroids\nand polycystic ovarian syndrome\nand of those three uh how frequent are\nthose and maybe I can constrain the\nquestion a little bit by saying\num today's discussion I imagine is going\nto be heard by men and women of all\nsorts of Ages so I uh maybe I'll direct\nthe question a little bit toward you\nknow at what age should these\ndiscussions start\num you know we always imagine that women\nin their 30s and 40s and 50s and onward\nshould be getting certain tests and\naddressing things like uh ovarian\nreserve and and other sorts of things\nbut you know maybe we could March\nthrough and just say for a woman in her\nteens who's already hit puberty what\nsorts of biomarkers whether or not\nthey're blood-based or per or\num phenotyping you know the outward\nappearance of uh\nshould those young women be paying\nattention to likewise for women in their\n20s 30s maybe we could take it more or\nless by by decade at starting at puberty\nassuming that woman hits puberty\nsometime what between what is it now the\naverage in the U.S is somewhere between\n12 and 16 years old do I have that right\nno you do not oh great so that's to be\nwrong so so it used to be 12 to 16. I\nwould say 50 years ago\nit's been moving younger and we think\nsome of that is related to toxin\nexposure as I mentioned but I was 10\nwhen I went through puberty so uh well I\nshould say menarchy and I started\ngrowing breasts much before that so\nI think\nnow I'm going to step away from the\nscience for a moment I'm going to do\nthat pretty fluidly and I'll try to call\nit out\nI think there's also a huge influence\nfrom stress\nand like the development of the adrenal\nglands\nso going back to the science\nthe issue in teenage years is that the\nhypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis\nand I like to think of it broader so\nstay with me hypothalamic pituitary\nadrenal gonadol a recent women testes\nmen\nthyroid\ngut axis\nso that to me is the control system so\nI'm kind of\nexpressing my bioengineering side here\nwell I think it's great to include the\nother organs and tissue systems of the\nbody because as we both know that the\nnarrow definition of just hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal it can't be just that\nright no it can't no yeah it doesn't\ntell the whole story\nso if you look at\nthe\nthe main sex hormones\nin a a young woman who's in her teenage\nyears the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal\ngonadal part of that is not fully mature\nso they're more likely to skip periods\nespecially under stress they have a lot\nof influences it really doesn't get well\nestablished until you're done with\nadolescence and I'm told that\nadolescence now is still like age 25 to\n26. I heard that and I was like I've got\ntwo daughters and I was like that's a\nreally long time and not just a\npsychologically defined or bio\npsychosocial mostly psychologically\ndefined I heard that from a psychologist\nso\nbiomarkers you asked about in your\nteenage years what I think is really\ninteresting is to look at cortisol\nto look at the dance between estrogen\nand progesterone in those years is less\nhelpful because I think there's a lot of\nvariability due to the immaturity of the\nsystem if you've got someone who's got\nreally regular periods it's probably\nbetter to do some benchmarking at that\nage but generally I find that\nbenchmarking\nis best performed in your 20s or 30s are\nperiods not that regular in terms of\nduration of the menstrual cycle when the\nmenstrual cycle first sets in\nit depends so I was like clockwork every\n28 days until I had my hysterectomy in\nAugust\nsame thing with my daughters I've got\ntwo daughters one's 17 the other is 23.\nfor a lot of women they're not regular\nand then there's the whole piece of oral\ncontraceptives and other forms of\ncontraception where you have no idea\nwhat the normal cycle is and I hope\nwe'll have some time to talk a little\nbit about oral contraceptives because I\nthink it is\nthis is now opinion again and not\nscience I think it is the number one\nendocrinopathy\nthat is iatrogenic for women uh we will\ndefinitely talk about it I get a lot of\nquestions about oral contraceptives\num in the social media space and also\nquestions about iuds quite a lot totally\nin particular copper iuds\nnon-non-hormonal IUD so we will\ndefinitely touch on that I'm an IUD\nCrusader so I just want to you know give\nyou that warning you're you're a fan do\nI have that right or you're anti I am a\nhuge fan which iuds in particular so I\nlike copper because it's non-hormonal\nit's as effective as getting your tubes\ndyed who would have thought right I mean\nit's that toxic to the sperm Mobility is\nthat how it works that's my\nunderstanding of it is that that it that\nit basically it's like a\nmore or less an electric fence to the\nthe sperm cap and just that's it\nelectric fence is a bit of a harsh\nanalogy but I'll work with that\nbut it's\nit's for 10 years so that you really\nhave\ncomplete autonomy and sovereignty over\nyour sexual life\nthat's profound and to not get all those\nDownstream risks they're associated with\na birth control pill the other thing\nthat's important to know about it I know\nthis is a sidebar\nwomen who use the copper IUD\nhave the highest satisfaction rate of\nanyone on contraceptives the highest\nsatisfaction rate and yet it is the\nleast used of all forms of contraception\nnow my favorite is vasectomy\nbut short of vasectomy I think the IED\nis a really great choice there are some\nrisks associated with it I'm not saying\nit's risk-free but I love IUD and I love\nit for younger women too because it used\nto be that when I went through my\ntraining which was 30 years ago we were\ntold you know don't put it in someone\nwho hasn't had a baby\nand that is patriarchal messaging\nbut getting back to your original\nquestion which is about biomarkers per\ndecade\nin your 20s\nthat's when you want to do some base\ncasing with estrogen progesterone and\ntestosterone\nso I think it's really helpful to know\nabout this this Tango you're from\nArgentina or your father I have\nArgentine lineage yes my grandparents\ndid Tango into their late 80s I I am I'm\nin my late 40s and I I still haven't\nstarted so I suppose there's time it\nmight be time for you to okay and it\nmight be a factor in their longevity did\nthey have good health span and my\ngrandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily\nremained mentally sharp until he died in\nhis late 90s but um almost burned down\ntheir apartment several times falling\nasleep with a cigarette in his mouth so\nI don't recommend anyone Smoke by the\nway uh but it was uh coffee mate uh red\nmeat and cigarettes and they lived into\ntheir 90s so that side of my family has\nthe genetic Advantage the other side\nless so\num but in any event uh Tango\num is a 2023 goal it has been every year\num the uh I'm gonna hold you accountable\ntoday okay we'll do and there no there\nwill be no YouTube video of me do at\nleast not initially Tim Ferriss actually\na phenomenal podcaster as we know is uh\nhe's a badass he's a badass Tango Tango\ndancer I know this through various\nsources yes yeah I've seen yeah so this\nTango between us and progesterone is\nincredibly important you want to have\nthe right lead do you want to have the\nright follow between the two hormones\nagain I'm stepping away from my science\nhat but what happens a lot of the time\nis that estrogen dominates in that Tango\nand when that happens it sets you up for\ngreater risk of fibroids endometriosis\nbreast pain\nprobably in association with the\nmicrobiome and the estrobolume can you\nfamiliarize me with the estrobloom yeah\nI'm delighted to know that I don't\nrecognize the term yeah so the\nestrobolume is the set of microbes\nin and their DNA their DNA mostly\nin the gut microbiome that set of\nmicrobes in their DNA so it's in the\nif you look at the totality\nthe subset\nof particular bacteria modulate estrogen\nlevels\nso a lot of this work was spearheaded by\nMartin Glaser\nand\nwhat we know is that there are some\nwomen who have an estrobolume that makes\nthem have a greater risk of certain\nestrogen mediated\nconditions like breast cancer\nendometrial cancer\nand a men prostate cancer\nso the estrobulum is incredibly\nimportant there's not a lot of attention\npaid to it but I always think in terms\nof my patients you know could this be\nsomeone who's got a faulty a strobe and\nwe need to adjust it with you know some\nof the microbiome\nmodulating\nuh nutrients nutraceuticals that we have\nso that they're less likely to have that\nthat Tango that's not working with\nestrogen progesterone so getting back to\nthe biomarkers\nif if you gave me an unlimited budget\nwhich I kind of have with some of my\num clients that I work with now\nwhat I would want to know is\nestrogen progesterone testosterone and I\nwant the timing right for that\nI'd want to know about DHEA and sort of\nthe whole Anderson pathway I'd want to\nknow about the metabolites of estrogen\nbecause some of them are protective and\nvery helpful others are a bit like\nHomer Simpson I mean they're just like\ncausing all kinds of problems in your\nbody increasing the risk of Quinones\nlike DNA damage and potentially an\nincreased risk of breast cancer although\nthat data I think is mixed\nI'd also like to know about their stool\nso I want to know about the microbiome\nso the best that we have right now is to\nlook uh when we do stool testing I do a\nlot of stool testing we can look at\nthings like beta glucoronidase\nare you familiar with BG I'm familiar\nwith it as a term and so for those\nlistening it very often not always when\nyou hear an ace ASE you're dealing with\nan enzyme so we can take a stab there\nand and it sounds like it's somehow\ninvolved in\num glucose metabolism of some sort or is\nit clickeronautation so it's involved in\nwhen you produce estrogen in the body\nthis is like the simplified version but\nwhen you produce estrogen you are meant\nto use it like send it to The receptors\nwhere it's meant to go and then lose it\nlike you don't want to keep\nrecirculating the estrogen like Bad\nKarma and that's what happens with\npeople who have high blade beta\ngluconidase so it's this enzyme that's\nproduced by three bacteria in particular\nin the gut and I see a lot of men and\nwomen who have elevated beta\nglucuronidase and then they have some\nestrogen dominance related to that is\nthat the total reason we don't really\nknow but it's one of the drivers it's\none of the levers and it can be detected\nfrom a microbiome AKA stool sample\nthat's right and in terms of blood\ntesting or various tests for these other\nbiomarkers getting estrogen testosterone\nand other ratios I realize there are\npeople have different means financial\nmeans but in general people wanting to\ndo a blood test it sounds like they're\ngoing to need to do it what women will\nneed to do it at different stages of\ntheir menstrual cycle if they had to\npick one\nyou know either in the follicular phase\nand or in the luteal stage of their\novarian menstrual cycle excuse me\novulatory menstrual cycle\nwhen would you suggest they do that if\nthey had to pick one so if you forced me\nto pick one I would say\nprobably day 21 to 22 for someone in her\n20s so we're focused right now in that\ndecade\nso for most women they've got a\nmenstrual cycle Dave that averages out\nat 28 days so this is about a week\nbefore they start their period\nfor women or more irregular it's harder\nto do that as women get older and we'll\ntalk about this in a moment\nusually the cycle gets a little shorter\nso as they start to decline in their\nprogesterone production their period\ngets a little closer together like mine\nbefore August was about every 26 days\nso\nat that point you want to test sooner\nlike day 1920 and I'm not talking about\nblood tests so a blood test is the\ncheapest thing it's usually what's\ncovered by insurance but my preference\nwould be to do dried urine\nI like to use saliva for cortisol I like\nto use dried urine so that I get\nmetabolomics in addition to the levels\nof these hormones and if I'm forced to\nI'll use blood testing and that's\ncertainly the gold standard\nfor all of these hormones that we're\ntalking about\nbut\num it's not as comprehensive and as you\nknow it's a quick little snapshot while\nthe needle's in your vein for you know\n30 seconds yeah the salivary cortisol\nmakes sense to me because my\nunderstanding is that you get free\ncortisol which is the active cortisol\nyou said with urine you're also getting\nthe metabolites that's right and then\num for blood testing you're getting it\nit's sort of a crude window into the\naverages ecstatic total level\nso uh let me go back and say one other\nthing about biomarkers a big part of the\ntesting that I do in phenotyping my\npatients I practice Precision medicine\nso I I like to\nalmost start with nutritional testing\nI don't think I've ever had a teenager\nI've got some NBA players that are 19 20\n21 so maybe those count\nbut uh those are men obviously but for\nnutritional testing\nthat would be a potentially a helpful\nthing to do in your 20s becomes less\nimportant as you get older and you\ndevelop more micronutrient deficiencies\nbut micronutrients play a huge role in\nterms of hormone production magnesium\nyou know the Magnesium is hugely\ninvolved in the way that you get rid of\nestrogen as an example\nso micronutrient testing what I usually\ndo is a combination of blood and urine\nand so I'm looking at all of the\nmicronutrients that we can measure that\nhave some clinical scientific basis\nbehind them\nif I could do that for a teenager I\nthink it might be helpful because\nI recently gave a lecture on breast\ncancer risk reduction\nanother quick sidebar\nand I was sad to find that\nintake of vegetables polyphenols is such\nan important predictor a future risk of\nbreast cancer like when you're a 50 60\nplus and the most important time is when\nyou're a teenager\nnow I have one daughter that eats\nvegetables she loves them and I have\nanother daughter who eats food that's\nbeige and it's very hard to get her to\neat the volume of vegetables you know\nfive colors a day which is what I do\nand\nif you have evidence that you could show\na 17 year old that they've got\nmicronutrient gaps\nI think that would be a motivator for\nthem to eat differently at a time when\nit's so critical\neven though it's you know 25 years in\nthe future that it's going to\npotentially change this Arc that they're\non\nwhat do you do for a young woman who\ndoesn't like vegetables is or is not\nsomehow able or willing to to get those\nfive colors a day of vegetable to help\nsupport the microbiome\nyou know our supplements a useful tool\nin that case\num what other sorts of tools Behavioral\nor otherwise are useful such a good\nquestion so here I'm going to invoke Rob\nKnight at UCSD\nso I think his his uh his gut project\nhas really been helpful in terms of\nunderstanding what kind of modulators\nare going to be important\nso what I try to get that person to do\nand I don't see many teens anymore other\nthan NBA players\nwhat I try to get them to do is to have\na smoothie\nvery hard to get them to have a smoothie\nevery day but if I could get them to\nhave a smoothie three times a week and\nto throw some of these vegetables in\nthat makes a huge difference I mean we\nknow that makes a difference in terms of\nmicrobiome change she should be blending\nup broccoli or kale cauliflower so\ncauliflower is great even they're\nputting things into the Smoothie yeah I\ndon't know if you can get a teenager to\ndo that but they often will use like I\nhave them do steamed broccoli that's in\nthe freezer because it's got very little\ntaste\nso that they could do that in a\nchocolate smoothie they could add some\ngreens I like greens powders are super\nconvenient so that with you know kind of\na taste that they like whether that's\nchocolate which is what most my clients\nwant or you know vanilla with berries\nand that sort of thing so that can go a\nlong way if you don't like vegetables\nand short of that I would say some\nsupplements but I would say that's a\ndistant second to making a smoothie I've\ngot one patient that I have to mention\nbecause\num\nhe took us to the extreme so he is a\nretired physicist professor at UCSD he\nfound out that his microbiome was a hot\nmess\nand developed autoimmune disease and so\nhe became hell-bent like only a\nphysicist could on changing his\nmicrobiome and he dramatically shifted\nit by having a smoothie every day with\n57 vegetables and fruits in it 57\nindependent 57 independent so\nI mean this just warms my heart the way\nthat he did this but he would go to the\nfarmer's market he would just get a\nbunch of this a bunch of that\nand he would go home make the smoothie\nand then stick it in the freezer so he'd\nhave a serving every day and he became a\ncompletely different person based on\nthis microbiome change his\nuh autoimmune disease is in remission\nhe um\nhe dropped a huge amount of weight he\nwent from being you know kind of this\nphenotype that I know you know well of a\nprofessor High performing traveling\naround the world on so many boards so\nmuch Innovation so many great ideas\nsuper computer guy to being someone who\ngets up in the morning gets in his hot\ntub exercises for like one to two hours\na day\nand then does a little work like he\ncompletely shifted the way that he lives\nand his microbiome shift you know who\nknows what what's the chicken and what\nthe what's the egg there but he had a\nhuge change in his physiology glucose\nwent from being quite high he had\nand he tracks all of this of course it's\nlike\nJupiter after all right and retired I\nsuppose might have had and he's retired\nbut he is he's got the longest time\nseries of anyone I know\nand he's tracked his glucose and Insulin\ngoing back 20 years\nso he can show you okay here's where I\nstarted having my smoothie\nand here's how my glucose and Insulin\nchanged as a result of that I'd like to\ntake a quick break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors athletic greens athletic\ngreens now called ag1 is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink that covers all\nof your foundational nutritional needs\nI've been taking athletic greens since\n2012 so I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast the reason I\nstarted taking athletic greens and the\nreason I still take athletic greens once\nare usually twice a day is that it gets\nto be the probiotics that I need for gut\nhealth our gut is very important it's\npopulated by gut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain the immune\nsystem and basically all the biological\nsystems of our body to strongly impact\nour immediate and long-term health\nand those probiotics and athletic greens\nare optimal and vital for microbiotic\nhealth in addition athletic greens\ncontains a number of adaptogens vitamins\nand minerals that make sure that all of\nmy foundational nutritional needs are\nmet and it tastes great if you'd like to\ntry athletic greens you can go to\nathleticgreens.com huberman and they'll\ngive you five free travel packs that\nmake it really easy to mix up athletic\ngreens while you're on the road in the\ncar on the plane Etc and they'll give\nyou a year's supply of vitamin d3k2\nagain that's athleticgreens.com huberman\nto get the five free travel packs and\nthe year supply of vitamin D3 K2 is\nthere a case for I'll say young women\nbut young women and men using\nover-the-counter probiotics as a way to\nenhance the microbiome this is something\nI hear about a lot I've heard that\nexcessive doses of capsule probiotics\ncan give a brain fog like condition\nI personally don't use capsule\nprobiotics unless I feel like my system\nis under a significant amount of stress\nin which case I might add that in for\nbrief periods of time or if I've just\ntaken antibiotics for a period of time\ndo you ever recommend that the college\nstudent or the high school student that\nshe or he take capsule probiotics\nassuming that they're getting let's say\nthree to five servings of vegetables per\nday either in smoothie form or some\nother form what are your thoughts on on\nsupplementing probiotics\nit sounds like such a simple question it\nis such a complex answer and I don't\nthink we really have the answer so I'll\ntell you the way that I approach it\nI look for randomized trials to support\nmy use of probiotics and frankly I'm\nunderwhelmed\nso I've seen some data\nif I invoke my\num NBA players for a moment\nalmost every player I've tested has\nincreased intestinal permeability they\njust have such a high training load\nprobably mediated by cortisol very high\nglucosis when they drain that they have\nincreased intestinal permeability so\nthose tight junctions in their intestine\nbecome loose they develop a lot of\ninflammation as a result of that and\nwhen you're a professional MBA player\nand you're making 20 million a year\nlike you don't want a lot of\ninflammation you want a little bit to\nlike help your muscles recover but you\ndon't want it to be\num adding to problems when you develop\nan injury so this is leaky gut leaky gut\nyeah I don't love that term but yeah\nwe'll use it here so there's a there's a\nparticular\nprobiotic that is helpful in athletes\nwith leaky gut so that's the kind of\nspecificity and randomized trial that\nI'm looking for\nthe rest of it\nI think there's support if you find help\nfrom it as you described if you take a\ncourse of antibiotics I mean first of\nall I would question whether you need\nthem but I try and avoid them there have\nbeen instances where they've been\nprescribed and I took them mostly in the\npast I was in college they seem like\nthey kind of gave them out you had a\nsinus infection to give you Pro you know\nantibiotics using like yeah the worst\ntreatment ever yeah so if you're coming\noff of antibiotics I think that's a good\ntime to do what we call replacement dose\nprobiotics I think what's far more\ninteresting is\nprebiotics I think the data is much\nbetter for prebiotics and\num a selective use of polyphenols\nhow would a person in their teens and\n20s or any age for that matter know\nwhat whether or not they have\nnutritional deficiencies what is the\nbest way to analyze if one is getting\nenough magnesium and for that matter\nwhat is going to be the best way to test\nthe microbiome you said stool sample and\nI'll come right back with the same\nquestion I asked about a blood test\nwhat time of day when during the month\num to establish a baseline so this would\nbe prior to embarking on a you know 97\nvegetables or how many years per day 57.\nwell I love the idea that you're telling\nus if I'm gathering correctly is that\nyes there's a case for probiotics but\nfor the typical person regardless of age\neating more vegetables or drinking more\nvegetables as the case may be is going\nto be beneficial for the gut microbiome\nperhaps without the need to go test\nwhether or not one is making a certain\nnumber of estrogen related metabolites\nor not just that that's a great starting\nPlace eat or consume more vegetables\num but if one wants to analyze their gut\nmicrobiome are there good tests\navailable to the general public this has\nbeen I'm not going to name companies but\nI've been tracking this over the years\nand it's never been clear to me that we\nknow what constituents of the gut\nmicrobiome are are best we know that\ndysbiosis is bad yeah and we know that\ndiversity of the microbiome is good we\nhear this yeah but no one's ever told me\nthat you want a particular ratio of one\nmicrobiota to another right in a way\nthat has made any sense to me at least\ntotally I'm not a microbiologist but\nwhereas with you know with testosterone\nin men we hear okay you want your free\ntestosterone to be about two percent of\nyour total perhaps with women you women\nare gonna have more testosterone than\nestrogen on average but still less than\nmen when you look at testosterone etc\netc but you can kind of get some some\ncrude measures but for the microbiome it\njust seems like long lists of microbiota\nfor which I just get dizzy I just if you\njust wrote out a bunch of I's and L's\nand s's you'd you can go halfway a bit\nbit the same information I'm not trying\nto poke at that field it's a beautiful\nfield but they haven't told me what to\nwhat I what my microbiota ought to look\nlike like what's a healthy microbiome\nchart well that's because we don't know\nI mean the best we have is Rob Knight's\nwork but even that is limited in terms\nof you know can I tell you that a a\nwoman in her 20s should have this\nparticular pattern with her microbiome\nno I can't so\num let me go to your first question\nbecause I think you just asked about six\nyour first question is about nutritional\ntesting\nwhat I like to do with nutritional\ntesting is run a panel that's looking at\nantioxidants so like vitamin A vitamin C\nalpha lipoic acid\num plant-based antioxidants because you\ncan measure that in the blood\nI like to look at some of the key\nvitamins especially the B vitamin range\nbecause as you probably know if you've\ngot a particular genetic\num polymorphism so you might be less\nlikely to be absorbing the right level\nof vitamin B9 folate vitamin B12 Etc\nI'm also looking going back to the\nantioxidants at glutathione because I\nthink that's such an important lever\nwhen it comes to detoxification which we\nhaven't talked about yet\nand then I'm looking at some of the\nMinerals Magnesium is really the most\nimportant and we know that somewhere\naround 788 of Americans are deficient in\nmagnesium that's like the the lowest\nhanging fruit I would be curious for\ninstance like with magnesium if that\nnumber of people are deficient does that\nmean that that number of people should\nbe targeting their nutrition towards\nfoods that contain magnesium and or\nsupplementing with magnesium and if so\nwhat forms of magnesium we've talked\nabout mag three and eight for Sleep\nthere's a Mexican there's so many forms\nit can be a little bit overwhelming to\npeople so any any detail in sourcing\nwould appreciate it great so first in\nterms of testing what I prefer to do\nis to mention one more than one lab and\nmore than one brand\num and I can just I'm speaking mostly\nfrom experience so uh for testing I do a\nlot of Genova neutrals\nduring the pandemic they developed an\nat-home test normally with a neutral\nvalve you have to get your blood drawn\nand you have to do a urine sample\nso a lot of people can't do that the\ngreat thing about this test is your\ninsurance usually pays for most of it\nand so the copay is about 150 dollars\nso during the pandemic they developed\nanother test called metabolomics which\ndoes much of the same testing but it's a\nfinger prick\nso most of my patients prefer that in\nfact they haven't gone back to the\nnutribal\nsecond lab is spectracell\nI use Spectra cell occasionally I find\nit not quite as easy in terms of fitting\ninto my practice but I've got friends\nand mentors like Mark Houston who does a\nlot of\nkind of Precision\ncardiometabolic Health he thinks\nspectrosol is the best test out there so\nyou asked about magnesium\nyou have to measure red blood cell\nmagnesium like whole blood\nand with deficiency it's interesting\nwith\nsupplementation\nfor my patients who tend toward\nconstipation\nand that's frankly about 80 percent of\nthe women that I take care of really yes\nwow I'd be curious as to why that that\nis\num is it I I can guess diet stress\num patriarchy\nrage\nto psychosis so Pine the um the pine\nsystem right\npsychology Immunology neural and\nendocrine factors combined is that yes\nand then I would say there's another\nFactor\nwhich is\nbeing female is a health hazard\nso we have twice the rate of depression\ninsomnia\nwe've got three to four x increased risk\nof multiple sclerosis\nwe've got five to eight times the risk\nof thyroid dysfunction\nso if you just look at that and you look\nat subtle pre-clinical thyroid\ndysfunction\na huge number of the women that I take\ncare of well let me back off\na large number of the women that I take\ncare of have thyroid dysfunction that's\ncontributing to constipation and if we\ngo back to that control system the\nhypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid\nCanal gut axis\nand they have a lot of perceived stress\ntogether with this borderline thyroid\nfunction that no mainstream medicine\ndoctor has told her is a problem and\nthen she's got a problem with the Tango\nbetween estrogen and progesterone\nshe's going to tend toward constipation\nwomen have a lot more constipation than\nmen\nthe gut is about 10 feet longer in women\ncompared to men\nwe should talk about some sex and gender\ndifferences and Define those sure and\nthey are much more likely to have a\ntorturous colon\nand the way you know that is you get a\ncolonoscopy and they tell you\nyeah it's really hard to like get in\nthere and do what we need to do as a\nbrief tangent but I think this is the\ntime to ask\num at what age now do Physicians insist\ntheir female patients get colonoscopies\nfor men I think the age used to be 50\nnow it's getting ratcheted back to 45 or\n40. again these are recommendations not\nrequirements but they're pretty strong\nrecommendations from depending on where\nyou live Etc\num for women how early do you think they\nshould get a colonoscopy to to explore\nfor possible polyps and or colon cancer\nyeah it's a really good question I don't\nknow the answer so what I've always\noperated with is 50. the way that I\nanswer that is to go to the U.S\npreventive task force rating to\ndetermine based on their synthesis of\nthe data what age is the most\nappropriate has it changed as you just\ndescribed for men from 50 to younger I\ndon't know so we should fact check that\nall these um additional health hazards\nfor women\num you mentioned some of the\nyou broadly mentioned psychological\nimpact right and of course these things\nare all related psychology immunology\nand one of the I think wonderful things\nabout\nneuroscience and Science in general and\nmedicine is that there's now an\nunderstanding that all the organs are\nconnected to one another it's a network\nit's a network and that the microbiome\nsits at had um at a key node within that\nNetwork\num and I think most people accept that\nnow yes yeah that seems to be a theme\nthat at least in the last 10 years is\nreally wonderful because\num certainly for Neuroscience it was\nthought that you know unless it's in the\ncranial vault\nit's not neural which is ridiculous\nbecause there's lots of nervous system\noutside the skull but in any case can I\ninterrupt for a second yes please so I\nthink you're right that there's an\nunderstanding about the network effect\nbut I think that\nas much as I love mainstream medicine\nand I trained in it and I'm so grateful\nfor my education I still think it is a\nsilo based way of taking care of\npatients so even if there's an\nunderstanding of the network effect more\nat the science level or as you described\nin Neuroscience there's still you know\nif you are a woman who has constipation\nfatigue\num\nmaybe an autoimmune condition\nfeel stressed out all the time feel like\nyour hormones are out of whack you get\nsent to the gastroenterologist for the\nconstipation you get sent to the\nrheumatologist for your autoimmune\nissues you maybe get sent to an\nendocrinologist if you've got thyroid\nproblems and there's very little\ncollaboration between these groups so\neven though there's an understanding of\nthe network effect\nin real life it's not happening\nlet's um let's go deeper down that path\nbecause I you point out something really\nimportant and you've mentioned\nconstipation a few times can we view\nconstipation as a serious enough symptom\nthat it warrants an immediate\nintervention that is does it flag or\nsignal\nproblems that are severe enough that\nthat should be the issue that's dealt\nwith uh for anybody that's experiencing\nit yeah and I mean sort of an odd topic\nfor many people because they think oh\nyou know bowel movements and sort of you\nknow there's that kind of um\npre-adolescent humor around this but I\nthink it's it's so important when you're\nwhat I'm hearing you say is that\nconstipation is far more common in women\nand it signals a general many problems\noccurring does that mean that women\nshould address constipation and if so\nwhat's the best way to address\nconstipation yeah I love this question\nbecause\nyou're doing can we have a quick little\nmeta conversation so you're doing\nsomething that I knew you would do which\nis\nyou're teaching me something and you're\nchanging like there's a social genomics\nthing happening where you're changing my\nthought about this so I just wanted to\nacknowledge that thank you thank you\nwell I think for me you know when I hear\nthat there's a kind of you know you're\ntalking about a phenotype constipation\nis a phenotype it's one that people\ngenerally don't wear a t-shirt\nexplaining it to people but that I'm\nguessing anything to do with sexual\nhealth\num bowel Health Urology people just\ndon't talk about right\num for all sorts of reasons and those\nreasons are probably so obvious that\nthey're not even worth discussing but\nbecause and also because we won't change\nthem except by talking about them yep so\nif you say\num women are far more constipated and\nthat's signaling a larger set of\nproblems yes then my immediate thought\nis well will relieving constipation\num pun uh intended retroactively\num will that assist in a great number of\nissues and or will it get them down the\nroad of thinking about those other\nissues more specifically like do I need\nmore magnesium or should I be putting\nvegetables in my smoothie you know so\nI'm curious about constipation as a\nTarget yeah for intervention that then\nopens up a bunch of other discussions\nbecause there are these certain nodes in\nthe in the mental health physical health\nspace that when someone you know like we\ntalk a lot of deliberate cold exposure\ndo I think it's magic no but I think\nthat if someone's getting themselves\ninto a cold shower once a day it opens\nup a nun a number of questions about\nthemselves and reveals a number of\nthings to themselves like how do I\nbuffer stress yeah what sorts of levels\nof control do I actually have and on and\non so perhaps not the best example but\nsome of us hate cold exposure right\nwhich is we have we have like a gene\nthat makes us stress out like you\nwouldn't believe which I would argue\nmakes it\num very likely that even 10 seconds of\ncold exposure gets you the effect that\nyou want as opposed to someone who\nadores cold exposure like a penguin\nneeds a lot more cold exposure for it to\nhave the the Adaptive response anyway\nthat's my way of gumbing through that uh\nquite uh you're you're quite correct\num so so let's answer those questions\nconstipation issue yeah so this is how\nyou're changing the way I think about\nthis\nso you're asking okay instead of looking\nat constipation as a constellation of\nsymptoms what about if you just used it\non its own as sort of a\num\na key\nindicator or signal\nof dysfunction with my network or maybe\nsomething broader\nand I think that's right\nso it makes me think of a few things it\nmakes me you're also changing this book\nthat I'm writing on autoimmunity and\nTrauma so thank you for that so\nwomen experience more trauma than men\nthis is well established if you look at\nthe ace studies that were done by the\nCDC in Kaiser in 1998 we know that men\nfor the most part middle-aged men have\nabout\num\nabout 50 of them experience significant\ntrauma as defined by the ace\nquestionnaire women are at 60 and that's\npretty durable since 1998. so women have\nmore they have different forms of abuse\nmuch more likely to have sexual abuse\nthey have a different HPA response than\nmen\ntheir perceived stress tends to be\nhigher and I'm generalizing for a\npopulation\nside note you know in Precision medicine\nwe don't do that we do medicine for the\nindividual individual not the population\nnot medicine for the average\nand so if you look at\nthe physiology of a female\nI think that constipation and that need\nto like control and restrain and hold\nthings in\nyou know tighten the anal sphincter\nI think that's part of the physiology\nso I'm veering away from the science but\nI do think that it is a really important\nsignal to pay a lot of attention to now\nyou also asked about microbiome testing\nshould we do that or do yeah well I have\na couple more questions about\nconstipation I never thought I'd ask\nthis many questions about concentrating\nbut now I'm fascinated by the way also\nthis morning I taught medical students\nat Stanford about the fact that we are\nbasically a series of tubes so you\ntalked about the the anal sphincter we\nare a set of sphincters from one end to\nthe other I mean we are a set of tubes a\nnervous system being one of those tubes\nand well and I think in eastern medicine\nthey talk about the various locks\nbetween those tubes and Chambers and\nit's not without coincidence there's\nsome real wisdom there of course wait\ndid you just talk about energetic\nAnatomy uh more or less I didn't say the\nword chakras but uh but I might in\npassage it's the bondas right are the\nare the are the the sphincters yes yes\nthat's right uh thank you for for that\nthe um so what defines constipation I\nmean in other words let's think about\nthe healthy rather than thinking about\nthe unhealthy let's how many bowel\nmovements should a woman or a man have\nper day assuming this is where it gets\ntricky because some people are doing\ntime restricted feeding some people are\neating more some people eat more fiber\nmore bulk larger meal at the end of the\nday a larger meal the beginning of the\nday we will never\num be able to sort out all those\nvariables but on average\num how many bowel movements and his\ntiming\nduring the day for bowel movements at\nall informative what works for you\num well when I'm asleep\num generally I don't want a bowel\nmovement so I'm going to be like most\npeople right well sleep is primary for\nyou right exactly um I always assumed\nthat morning time yeah was a was a\nhealthy time for bowel movements um and\nI think almost everybody babies included\nrecognize the feeling of being lighter\nand more energetic when they've\nevacuated totally colon totally um in\nfact so much so that I'm obsessed with\njungian and Freudian psychology that the\nfirst thing we learn when we come into\nthis world right is that we want\nsomething we we feel some sort of\nautonomic arousal stress whether or not\nit's food or warmth or the need to have\na bowel movement one of the first things\nthat parents learn is how to recognize\nthat not by the odor coming from the\ndiaper but by the look on the baby's\nface or their agitation agitation\nsignals the need for some sort of relief\nright temperature relief food relief\num evacuating the bowel relief so my\nunderstanding is that as autonomic\narousal increases in the early part of\nthe day ideally after a good night's\nsleep that bowel movements become more\nlikely unless that arousal becomes so\ngreat that then people feel so quote\nunquote locked up right\num because of the balance of the\nautonomics of features so early day I'm\nguessing and again in the second half of\nthe day and here I'm totally guessing\num and certainly not having to wake in\nthe middle of the night\num yeah those are my best guesses\nthat's great so I would agree with that\nwhen I was at Harvard Medical School in\nUCSF for residency I was taught that\nconstipation is having a bowel movement\nless frequently than whenever once every\nthree days\nso I don't think I've ever laughed out\nloud on this podcast as a consequence of\nof uh textbook medical knowledge are you\nkidding me is that ridiculous well that\nsounds like and and here pun intended\nthat sounds like the uh the conclusion\nof some very um constipated personally\nand and and and in other ways\nconstipated individuals and again this\nmight seem like an odd conversation but\nthe the discussion around conservation\nis is present in psychological\nliterature yes because of this\nrelationship to the autonomic system\nwell it's a metaphor in literature\nit's crucial so you you spoke to a\nnumber of different threads that I think\nare important here so that's the\ndefinition that I learned and I was I\nheard that and I was like hell no that\ndoesn't work for me it doesn't work for\nanyone I know\nand I spent a lot of time especially in\nmedical school and in my internship\nwhere you rotate on medicine\ndisimpacting\nwomen like older women who come in who\nhaven't had a bowel movement in a month\nwhoa and that let me tell you that is\nnot nice for anybody yeah believe me I\nbecame a scientist not a physician for a\nnumber of reasons both positive and\nnegative that's one of them yeah so my\ndefinition of constipation as a western\nmostly white girl\nis that if you're not having a bowel\nmovement every single morning and you\nhave a feeling of complete evacuation\nanything less than that is constipation\nso that's how I Define it if you're in\nIndia and you're eating food that's got\na fair amount of microbes in it it's\nless you know sanitary I'm using that\nword\num as carefully as I can\ngenerally they have a bowel movement\nafter every meal\nbut they've got a different microbiome\nthey're exposed to different microbes\nhere in the U.S I would say Wednesday\nyou also spoke to something very\nimportant which is the balance between\nthe parasympathetic nervous system rest\nand digest and poop versus the\nsympathetic nervous system kind of the\non button you know\nfight\nflight freeze spawn\nso I think for those of us who've got\nissues with autonomic balance\nit can lead to constipation and I like\nthat constipation could be pulled out\nand kind of writ larger as an important\nsignal what sorts of tools do you\nrecommend people use to\num\nrelieve constipation\num in eating more fiber sounds like\nreducing stress is going to be a huge\none yes what are your favorite stress\nreduction tools\num I like to divide these into\nreal-time tools so a big proponent of\nlike physiological sign real time you\nknow these sorts of things but things\nthat can really lower the Baseline on\nstress overall to facilitate\nconstipation and other other broad\nindicators of Health\nso I'm not a fan of lowering stress I'm\na fan of lowering perceived stress and I\nthink the distinction is really\nimportant\nI learned when I was in my 30s that\nI was a massive stress case and I didn't\nknow it it was just sort of\nI think I through residency through\nworking 120 hours a week I just was so\naccustomed and sort of\num that was 120 not under 20 folks yeah\nnot unusual in in medicine well they\nthey've changed training so that you\nwork no more than 80 hours a week now\nbut that was before my time\nso\nI became\naccustomed to a massive amount of\ncortisol massive\nand\nI would say I've spent the past 20 years\nreally working on perceived stress to\nfind I think all of us in all a cart\nmenu\nof what is most effective\nso what works for me now at my age is\ndifferent than you know the the TM I did\nas a college student Transcendental\nMeditation it's different than the I\nbecame a certified yoga teacher when I\nwas in my 30s that is very effective for\na lot of people\nit wasn't enough for my Matrix\nI do holotropic breath work\num I didn't read it but I saw it she\njust had a paper and sell on your sign\nand\num it kind of it made me think like\nteach me how to teach teach me how to\nsigh like can you say a little bit about\nthat like how do you do it yeah very\nbriefly that study was we we wanted to\nfind a minimal effective dose\nintervention yeah I just wanted yeah so\nfive minutes a day we need to figure out\nwhat people do every day yeah and we\nwere monitoring\nsubjective mood Etc but also Biometrics\nremotely so it's kind of a nice\nBiometrics HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep\ncortisol uh I wish\num so this was done during the pandemic\nmore than 100 subjects the advantage was\nthat we got data 24 hours a day because\nthey're pinging us in their data uh\nwearing HRV 24 yeah nice so that was\nnice resting heart rate\num subjective mood we would get in touch\nwith them daily so when people were\nswapped between groups like any good\nstudy but five minutes a day of sort of\nstandard if you will forgive me\nmeditations are just sitting no\ninstructions about how to breathe just\nfocusing on\num closing their eyes and focusing on\nfocusing yep\num another group did box breathing yep\ninhale hold exhale hold for equal\ndurations the duration of each of those\ninhales and holds was set by their\ncarbon dioxide tolerance so somewhere\nbetween three and eight seconds\ndepending on how well they regulate\ncarbon dioxide\nanother group did cyclic signs so this\nwould be double inhale through the nose\nso big inhale through the nose\nfollowed by it to lungs empty exhale\nthat second inhale after the first big\nlong inhale through the nose is really\nimportant because it makes sure that all\nthe collapsed abiola the lungs totally\nsnap open and then the exhale you\noffload a lot of carbon dioxide that's\nvery similar to holotropic breath work\nnot yes not not\num not unlike holotropic breath we're a\nlittle bit pranayama-ish but the exhale\nis rather passive as opposed to active\nand then the fourth category was cyclic\nhyperventilation which is a lot like\nTumo AKA Wim Hof ish breathing different\nthan Wim Hof breathing so this would be\nso very active inhales and exhales\nevery 25 cycles of inhale exhale that'll\nbe one cycle long exhale hold lungs\nempty 15 to 30 seconds then repeat for\nabout five minutes now the info everyone\ndid that for five minutes and what we\nfound was that the cyclic sign led to\nthe greatest improvements in mood Around\nthe Clock not just around the the\npractice or during the practice as well\nas lowered resting heart rate\nimprovements in sleep\nEtc and you got it publish and sell yeah\nwe were so amazing we're very fortunate\nI think um the the thankfully the\nreviewers and editors understood that\nthese minimal intervention things uh\nhopefully are going to be of use to\npeople so so useful to people I mean how\noften do you read a paper like that that\ncould offer a behavior change\nthat is so easy to implement I mean I\nlove that question thank you so what\nabout did you tell them not to drink\nbecause alcohol has such a huge effect\non HRV yeah so in this case we didn't\ntell them to alter anything else about\ntheir behavior just hoping it was\nbackground kind of across the system yes\nand some were Stanford students others\nwere from the general population any\nFrat Boys that were drinking heavily\nprobably not well during the pandemic I\nthink alcohol intake went way way up\nacross the board\num I mean isn't if I had a magic wand I\nwould I would ask that people either not\ndrink or drink two drinks per week\nmaximum at least that's my understanding\nof the literature\num are you familiar with the whoop data\nwith alcohol no but we have a\ncollaboration with through that paper\nyeah um and it certainly disrupts\npatterns of nighttime sleep in\nparticular from my understanding that\nfirst phase of sleep that's related to\nthe massive growth hormone release that\nyou all really need and want in\ndifferent measure growth hormones we did\nnot no the second iteration of this\nstudy will certainly include free\ncortisol by saliva hormone panels well\nI'm beginning to think that we should\nalso\num be asking people how often they're\ngoing to the bathroom and what time of\nday yes I mean this thing around\nconstipation is uh is super interesting\nand I think that plus um blood markers\nand then I'm I'm very excited to learn\nthat\num that urine contains additional\nmarkers that could be informative so\nyeah it was it was a fun study uh not\neasy study to do with that number of of\nsubjects um takes a lot of training for\nyour research assistants yeah it was a\nbig group it was nine people in our\ngroup and three clinicians and a lot of\na lot of phone calls and a lot of back\nand forth but you know and thank you to\nthe subjects who served as the uh the\nreal life guinea pigs so yeah I think\nthat stress you know people's I think\npeople are starting to appreciate that\nthere are ways that they can relieve\ntheir stress that that don't only fall\nunder the categories of vacation right\nand meditation but I want to say that\nmeditation is obviously a wonderful tool\num it's just it's a it's a tool not\nunlike any other tool that is great for\nsome people and less great for others\nwell certainly it's a great tool and\nit's got such a scientific basis behind\nit\nbut there's so many things on this a la\ncarte menu sex orgasm\num connection\nfeeling heard and seen and loved\num yeah let's talk about that you know\nyou mentioned earlier that all these\nstress factors you you said patriarchy\nright yeah but I think what if I may\num at risk of uh of just strengthening\nthat uh statement I I mean that that to\nme is is signaling a bunch of other\nfactors around us you said like keeping\nkeeping things in\num\nwhat do you think explains let's talk\nabout that because I think that that's\nlikely to have raised a certain flag in\npeople's minds like what exactly is she\ntalking about are you talking about less\nopportunity are you talking about less\nopportunity to\num to vocalize are you talking about\nless opportunity to vocalize and be\nheard I mean I realize that there are an\ninfinite number of variables but given\nthat it sounds like a really strong\ninput to the system uh what I mean by\nthat is that psychology is influencing\nbiology and you're saying that that\nthese uh\nthat these power power dynamics\nstructures and Dynamics are impacting\nI'd love let's hear your thoughts on\nthat because uh I I hate to let a flag\nlike that go by without fleshing it out\nand never waste a good flag well and\nlet's preface it by by just saying that\nlike people will have different opinions\non this and that's and I think that's\nhealthy and like with the discussion\nabout constipation let's talk about what\npeople aren't willing to talk about when\nit comes to health love it so we might\nneed to talk about patriarchy on part\ntwo but I'll give you some material that\nI've been working with\nI started I did not even understand the\nexistence of patriarchy until I was a\nbioengineering undergraduate at MIT I\nshould mention which has always had a\nbit of a of a male\num askewed male in terms of Faculty\nnumbers well my my that's true at most\nuniversities true well my postdoc\nadvisor was the late Ben Barris who was\na female to male transition transgender\ninterest first transgender member in the\nNational Academy of Sciences were my\nclosest friends unfortunately he died of\nof pancreatic cancer we were very very\nclose they're actually making a\ndocumentary about Ben but Ben this is\ninteresting Ben went to MIT because he\nwanted to be around a lot of men yeah\nthat's a lesser known fact but then he\nwas a very strong advocate for women he\nwent as Barbara when he was Barbara and\num by the way he's given me permission\nto share all this prior to his death I\nrecorded a lot of conversations yeah\num I only ever knew him as Ben by the\nway but when he was at MIT he was\nidentified female and he later talked\nabout the intense\num\nsuppression oppression literally is how\nhe described it especially given that he\nwas performing so well yes so you just\ndefined patriarchy\nyou did it yourself\na couple things\nwhen I was in bioengineering\nI took a women's studies class\nand it was all about teaching\nundergraduates about the existence of\npatriarchy which I would Define maybe at\nits simplest as power over\nI'm not saying men are patriarchy I'm\nsaying something very different which is\npower over\nlet me correct one thing that you said I\ndidn't go to MIT as an undergraduate\nso I'm from I was in Alaska and I went\nto the University of Washington for\nbioengineering in Seattle in Seattle\nokay I dropped out of a graduate program\nin bioengineering to go to the Harvard\nMIT\nprogram for Health Sciences and\ntechnology in Boston thanks for that\nclarification University of Washington\nalso wonderful place I have many many\nmany many many many many wonderful close\ncolleagues there it's an incredible\nplace especially for vision science\nit's especially good for engineering\nbioengineering but\num yeah so my my MD is jointly between\nMIT and Harvard and it's the oldest\nmaybe largest although Harvard says this\na lot program for biomedical engineers\nand uh MD phds physician scientist\ntraining program\ngreat thanks for that clarification I'm\ngoing to blame the internet for this one\nI am I think we need to send our our\nWikipedia editors out there I think\nLinkedIn is correct okay great well\nWikipedia editors note get out there and\nmake that make the correction now you\nheard it\num so\nstress that is what you're really\ntalking about is systemic stress in the\nbody as a concept as a consequence\nexcuse me of systemic stress of\nenvironment that's right\nyou know there's particular forms of it\nI would say this also relates to\nWhite Privilege it relates to\nracism\nand when you look at\nyou know kind of the way that systems\nincluding my beloved MIT\nthe way that they're set up is that\nmight make us makes right\nand generally the people that are the\nstrongest\nyou know big men strong men they're the\nones who tend to be the most successful\nso for people who are bipoc for people\nwho don't have white privilege for women\nit's a different experience and so I'm\nusing patriarchy as kind of a\numbrella here but it connects to many\nother things\nI'd like to take a brief break and thank\nour sponsor inside tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test the\nproblem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that you get\ndata back about metabolic factors lipids\nand hormones and so forth but you don't\nknow what to do with those data\ninsidetracker solves that problem and\nmakes it very easy for you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional behavioral\nmaybe even supplementation based\ninterventions you might want to take on\nin order to adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors hormones lipids and\nother things that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health to bring those\nnumbers into the ranges that are\nappropriate and indeed optimal for you\nif you'd like to try inside tracker you\ncan visit insidetracker.com huberman and\nget 20 off any of inside hackers plans\nthat's inside tracker.com huberman to\nget twenty percent off I want to use\nthis as an opportunity to a keep this in\nmind as I return to a question that I\ndidn't close the hatch on earlier and\nit's my fault which is I'm now clear on\nthe fact that a woman in her late teens\nearly 20s ought to know something about\nher testosterone estrogen thyroid\ncortisol levels\nshould start at least thinking about her\nmicrobiome\nshould be thinking about\nhow how many bowel movements and the\ntiming of those bowel movements per day\nreally and\nI'm assuming that what I just described\nis also true for women in their 20s 30s\n40s 50s on up to hundreds is that\ncorrect\nthat's correct but I would say that\nthere are\ndifferential opportunities\nby decade\nso I'm glad she circled it back to\nteenagers and testosterone because I\nthink if you know\nfor instance in your teenage years that\nyou have high androgens and that you've\ngot this potential phenotype way into\nthe future that you may not even notice\nI mean maybe you notice you've got a few\nextra hairs on your chin or something\nif you know that your testosterone is\nelevated or some other androgen it might\nchange the Arc of how you take care of\nyourself so I think that could be very\nhelpful in your teenage years in your\n20s for people who are a stress case\nlike me so age 27 on the words at UCSF\nif I had known that I was such a high\ncortisol person\nI think I would have done things\ndifferently I would have changed my\nbehavior\nand I don't know because I didn't base\ncase these but\nyour testosterone\ncan decline starting in your 20s kind of\ndepending on how much stress your Matrix\nis under so for women that can start as\nearly as 28 usually your testosterone\ndeclines by about one percent per year\nwhat level of testosterone do you like\nto see in a woman once she's sort of\npost let's say after age 25 what kind of\nrange is healthy I know what the\nreference range is only because I know\none could look it up I don't know it's\noff the top of my head immediately but\nwhat what's a kind of a nice reference\npoint there so the way I tend to\ndescribe this on podcasts is the top\nhalf of the normal range great\nso that I think is a good benchmark\nyou know for PCOS\ngenerally it's much higher than that you\nknow I've seen patients with PCOS where\ntheir total testosterone is 100 to 200.\ndo they always have peripheral\nmanifestations of that a little bit of\nhair the the skin plaques I've heard\nabout you know so darkened skin\nirregular periods regular periods is\nthat\num you know I get a lot of questions\nabout PCOS yeah\num and you're the first person we've had\non this podcast that's really qualified\nto talk about PCOS in a real way\num so here we're talking about too many\nandrogens cysts on the ovary irregular\novarian\nexcuse me I keep saying that ovulatory\nslash menstrual cycle\num\nwhat are some other indicators and do\nyou recommend that women start taking\nAndrogen blockers or so or I mean how do\nseems to be a lot of PCOS out there I'm\nhearing about it a lot\nso glad you asked about this so PCOS is\none of those really\npoorly understood conditions that gets\nit kind of flows flies below the radar\nuntil a woman wants to get pregnant or\nshe's got some other issue that drives\nher to a physician\nthe problem is that it is a syndrome\nright so polycystic ovary syndrome\nsometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome\nand syndromes don't necessarily fit\ntogether into a really clear diagnostic\ncriteria\nso in this instance there are three\ndifferent criteria that we look for so\nthis is on the ovaries having\num clinical manifestations of\nhyperandrogenism so that could be\nhirsutism acne other things and then\nusually irregular periods and the way\nthat that's defined at least by the uh\nlatest criteria is having a period every\n35 days or less\nso typical cycle length 28 is 35 days\nyou know you're skipping a period here\nand there\nso those are the those are the criteria\nthat we use to diagnose PCOS there are\nabout four different systems out there\nin the literature for diagnosing PCOS\nwhich is where it starts to get\nconfusing so there's some women who have\ngnosis on their ovaries but they've got\nhirsutism and they've got irregular\nperiods could you define haircitism here\nstatism is increased hair growth usually\nin places that you don't want it so for\nwomen it can be you know kind of male\npattern they might notice it on their\nbreasts on their chest\num\nand then there's of course a familial\nquality to that like I was just looking\nat a paper last night looking at\nIsraelis and how much hair statism they\nhave and whether this is related to CH E\nrepeats on the Androgen receptor\ndo they get um not Israelis but um do\nwomen who\num who might have PCOS experience um\nandrogenic alopecia so hair loss that's\nsort of of the quote-unquote male\npattern baldness of course it's Androgen\npattern baldness as opposed to male\nwe're talking about testosterone DHT\nrelated sometimes you know this is where\nI'm going to invoke clinical experience\nrather than what I've seen in the\nliterature women definitely can have\nsome androgenic alopecia\nI tend to see it later in life\nbut this is an important point because\nwe think of PCOS as you know I was just\ntalking about it in teenage years like\nwouldn't it be nice to know that you\nhave this phenotype and you're at risk\nfor all the things that people are at\nrisk for and we haven't talked about\nglucose and Insulin yet we should\nwhat we know is that\nPCOS is not just a problem in terms of\nirregular periods and then difficulty\ngetting pregnant so those are mostly\nproblems in your 20s 30s early 40s but\nit is a massive risk factor for\ncardiometabolic disease as you get older\nso many people tend to pigeonhole PCOS\nis a problem of reproductive age we have\nto be thinking of it over the entire\nfemale life cycle and I would say it's\neven more important to consider it over\nthe age of 50 you know average age of\nmenopause is 51-52 because we know that\nthat elevated testosterone the high\nandrogens\nare probably the greatest cardio\nmetabolic driver of disease for women\nwith PCOS wow now one other thing I want\nto mention and I still have my notes\nthat we're going to talk about\nmicrobiome testing because that's such a\nfun subject\nwhat I was taught to do\nagain saying this was so much love for\nthe people who have taught me how to do\nmedicine what I was taught to do is that\nif you have a woman with PCOS you make\nthe diagnosis you measure her\ntestosterone you see if she has acne\nblah blah\nyou ask that woman one question\ndo you want to get pregnant or not\nso then you have these women with PCOS\nwho get started on a birth control pill\nif they don't want to get pregnant if\nthey want to get pregnant then you help\nthem get pregnant by addressing some of\nthese PCOS issues like maybe you give\nthem Clomid or you do something to make\nthem ovulate more frequently\nthat is the way that most conventional\nmedicine approaches this and it does\nwomen at gigantic disservice so one of\nthe things I'm speaking into is the\ngender gap that exists so I my feeling\nis that the research money that goes\ninto women's health is abysmal compared\nto what goes into mental health really\nand I think that's changing but there's\nalso a huge lack of awareness of sex and\ngender differences when it comes to the\nway that we construct\nclinical trials and other experiments\nwell that's absolutely true I mean I sit\non I've sat on NIH review panels for\nmore than a decade now I'm a regular\nstanding member which is only to say\nthat I see the research as it's being\nproposed yes and now\nit's required no Grant will get funded\nwithout\nsex as a biological variable and here\nI'm by the way folks this is sex\nbiological sex the noun not sex the verb\nboth are super interesting obviously but\num when we say sex is a biological\nvariable meaning even if it's a study on\nmice how did that start though that\ndidn't start that long ago it must have\nbeen I think we can think\nI don't want to miss attribute here I\nthink we can thank Francis Collins for\ninsisting on this amen Francis\nBernadine Healy has done so much to help\nus but you know she made the Women's\nHealth Initiative which I hope will get\nto\nwhich is a hot mess like so confusing\nthe data that came out of that yeah so\nand these trials are long and so the\ndata are only now starting to emerge so\njust to be clear I mean I have a a\nquestion that I don't think is going to\ntake us off track but this is I'm going\nto pose this question as a hypothesis\nbecause I think it's likely to be a\nlittle bit of a of a not a barbed wire\nquestion but maybe like a prickly\nquestion when people first hear it but\nit's posed as a hypothesis you mentioned\nsome of the psychosocial stress issues\nbased on at the organizational level\ninstitutional level societal level maybe\nright down to the family and and just\nlife that are biasing Health outcomes\nfor the worse in female populations okay\nyou refer to as the patriarchy I'm just\ntrying to put it make sure that we're\nboth talking about the same thing and\nthat's non-exhaustive I realize that's\njust a subset of the issues\nI'm also hearing there's a lot more PCOS\nwhich is hyper androgenization of the\novary in there we're talking about you\nmentioned you know excess testosterone\nwhich females naturally have more\ntestosterone than they do estrogen\nanyway but we're talking about elevated\nlevels\nhere's a hypothesis one hypothesis would\nbe that the increased androgens and the\npieceo PCOS are a consequence of the\npsychosocial conditions that are\nI don't say forcing but are biasing the\nneed for females to\num think behave react act in certain\nways\nto survive let alone Thrive is that a I\ndon't say this for any kind of political\ncorrectness hypothesis this is a in my\nthis would be a fun interesting and I\nthink important study to run right\ndepending on stress and the conditions\nthe specific\ntype of stress do females under produce\nor over produce androgens or is it a\nneutral effect does that make make sense\nI love this question so let me just\nparaphrase the last part of it to make\nsure I got it\nit sounds like what you're asking is\ncould PCOS or at least some phenotypes\nof PCOS be a response to what I'm\ncalling patriarchy\nand then you add a second part to it\nwhich is do healthy women\nlike what is their production of\ntestosterone like is that right yes and\nand with the acknowledgment I mean\nyou're the expert here\num you're the physician clinician an\nexpert in hormones and I'm not but with\nthe understanding that absolute levels\nof hormones are interesting but perhaps\nnot as interesting as the ratios of\ntestosterone to estrogen so when we're\ntalking about excess testosterone we're\nreally not talking about oh women making\na lot of testosterone because frankly\nthey already make a lot like then most\npeople that weren't aware of that I\nwasn't aware that women make more\ntestosterone right and so it's not\nsaying that testosterone in women is bad\nor is always a reaction to the\nenvironment yes but when it becomes\num super physiological or hyper elevated\nis I could imagine all sorts of social\nconditions that would create that so in\nmales and females but here we're talking\nabout PCOS and females in particular so\nI'd love for you to speculate\num should we run the study we should\ntotally run the study because\nI don't know the answer\nI suspect that you're onto something\nit may not explain all of the women with\nPCOS because as I mentioned there's a\nlot of different phenotypes but I think\nit could explain\na significant portion\nand you know you're almost you're saying\nif we look at the gene environment\ninterface this environmental influence\nof having being someone who's got power\nover you if if PCOS was a response to\nthat\nthe way that we treat it would be\ncompletely different\nso on the one hand I want to be careful\nnot to dismiss the suffering and\nexperience of women with PCOS I've got a\nlot of women with PCOS in my family and\nit is\nthere's so much pain and suffering you\nknow especially if you want to have a\nbaby and you try for years and you just\ncan't ovulate\non the other hand\nI read a paper recently and maybe we\ncould cite this\nthat compares the phenotype of a woman\nwith PCOS to a man who is hypoandrogenic\nand I think that's a really interesting\nway to look at this because\nthe thread we haven't talked about with\nPCOS is the the role of insulin and\nglucose\nso for some of the phenotypes of PCOS\nthe problem is hyper insulin emia High\ninsulin in the blood is driving those\nthika cells and ovaries to overproduce\ntestosterone these women are insulin\ninsensitive so\nmore insulin is being cranked out\nand these cells in the ovary are\ntherefore making more Androgen you don't\nlike to say insulin resistant oh I I can\nuh I don't have a problem saying okay\nI'm just a little bit outside the lane\nlines of my expertise so I was trying to\nuse it what is the correct nomenclature\nso that we can make sure well what I\nlike about insulin insensitive the way\nthat she just said it is that I think\nthat offers people a way in and I love\nto do that in terms of messaging insulin\nresistance starts to lose people because\nthey don't really get what that means at\na receptor level I think I say insulin\ninsensitive because when people hear\ninsulin sensitive it almost sounds like\na bad thing but that's actually what you\nwant so I think I think that's how I\ndefaulted to insulin what's your insulin\nI don't know what I'm due for a blood\ntest yes you are I'm due for a blood\ntest um I had blood work done for eight\nmonths um sure that'd be great I uh I'm\nalways\num experimenting with different\nsupplements and different behavioral\nregimens and I've kept charts since I\nwas 19. oh you're like my patient I I've\nbeen sort of Obsessed by this and I\nwould say\neverybody if you can afford it and at\nthe time actually I had to save up\nInsurance wouldn't cover it\num get some basic blood work done so you\nhave a reference do it as soon as\npossible because even you know the we've\nbeen talking about these women over the\nlife cycle\nI wish I knew what my insulin was when I\nwas a teenager I wish I wish I knew what\nmy fasting insulin was I really wish I\nknew my postprandial insulin like in my\nteenage years in my 20s in my 30s well I\nknew it in my 30s starting at 35. are\nyou a fan of continuous glucose monitors\nthe hugest most gigantic fan of cgms\nI've never seen any tool that I've ever\nused in medicine change Behavior the way\nthat cgms do wow why do you think they\nare so effective at changing Behavior\nI've tried one and I really liked it I\nlearned that in the sauna my insulin or\nmy blood glucose goes up probably by a\nbit of dehydration I learned what kind\nof foods work for me which don't\num I thought it was fascinating I\nlearned how every Behavior you could\npossibly imagine use your imagination\nimpacts blood glucose totally totally\nfascinating to me including how a\ntwo-way wake-ups during the middle of\nthe night versus one versus none\nimpacted blood glucose the next morning\nfascinating for a data junkie like me it\nwas like I was in heaven\num why do you think they are so\neffective in changing behavior is it\nbecause of that that people can see that\nreal-time control like scan in and like\noh that's the that's the sandwich I\nthink it's I think it's many things I\nthink it's\ngenerally the enchantment\nof learning about your own chemistry and\nbiology I love it and I think for me\nwhat I've seen you know I feel like\ndoctors are basically marketers\nlike the sacred marketing like our job\nas a physician is to convince people\nto do something that we think is good\nfor them based on the best science\nbut we can't just say here I wanted to\nfill this prescription for a ctm you\nhave to Market it you have to say\nI think this completely changes the way\nthat you approach your pre-diabetes I\nthink this could dramatically affect\nyour risk of Alzheimer's disease that\nyou're so worried about that your mother\nhas so our job as Physicians is to be\nthat sacred marketer\nso cgms are one of my tools that I think\nare so crucial so enchantment number two\nyeah it's the real-time effect\nso if you go get your glucose and\nInsulin measured or maybe you do like a\ntwo hour glucose challenge test where\nyou look at glucose and Insulin at the\nfasting point one hour later two hours\nlater or more frequently\nthat does not have the same kind of\nbehavior effect as having continuous\ndata where you can say okay I drove to\nsee you Andrew from my place in Berkeley\nand it was stressful it was torrentially\nraining and I know my glucose was\nelevated like I think really\nunderstanding\nwhat the\nthe mediators are of your glucose\ncontrol is essential now that said\nit's also kind of a later effect I mean\nI'd rather know your insulin and we know\nfrom uh the white hat white Hall study\nthat insulin especially postprandial\ninsulin vascular insulin 2 can change\nyears and years before you get a change\nin glucose\nso um that's more for pre-diabetes and\ndiabetes so I think those are the main\nreasons why I think it's such an\nimportant tool\nthird thing is it democratizes data\nwhich you do too I mean incredible how\nyou do that with your podcast but I\nthink one of the most hopeful and\nexciting things that I'm seeing right\nnow\nin the health space is that we're going\nfrom\nthis patriarchal relationship where\ndoctors hold the power and are The\nGatekeepers of data to patients and\nclients having much more access to that\nenchantment about their own chemistry\nand their own biology so to me that is\nso exciting like for me to be able to\nI've got you know probably 100 patients\nthat are in a data stream with me where\nwe're looking at their glucose and I can\nI mean I'm on sabbatical so I'm not\ndoing this so much anymore but I can\ncall a patient be like why is your\nglucose so high like what did you do oh\nit was my birthday I had a piece of\nbirthday cake like that kind of\ncollaboration\nthat also is\nteaching the patient to be their own\nclinician to me that is a loop of\nbenevolence and integrity that I think\nis essential to creating Health we've\ngot a disease care system we need the\ndemocratization of data to become a\nhealth-based system\nAmen to that a million times over we\nshare that sentiment I can tell it at a\ndeep level I I think the pandemic\nactually assisted in well harm to many\nthings but it assisted in people's\nunderstanding that um no magic fairy nor\nthe government nor any anyone was going\nto arrive at their door with a kit of\nthings to make them healthy right that\nprovide sunlight movement sleep and all\nthe various aspects of nutrition no\nnothing nothing that everyone has to\nhave access to first and foremost and\nthen\nImplement those things as best they can\nspeaking of which and kind of circling\nback to this idea of people in their\nlate teens 20s 30s and onward\nif you had a magic wand\nand you could give like two or three\ndon'ts or to make it personal if you\ncould go back in time and\nerase certain behaviors what would the\nthe don'ts category be\num you can tell us more than two or\nthree\num but if the goal is to maximize\nvitality and Longevity and those are not\nalways uh parallel to one another right\nthey're certainly not the same thing\nsometimes orthogonal but let's just say\nfertility\nbeing a proxy for vitality and Longevity\nI think people will sometimes forget\nthis that fertility isn't just about\npeople who want to conceive children\nit's also it's a it can serve as a proxy\nfor vitality and Longevity so what would\nyou like to see patients let's focus\nfirst on female patients but\num if it extends to male patients as\nwell what would you like to see them not\ndo yeah or do far less of I really like\nthat\nso I would say a few things I'll just\nheadline them and then we can go into\ndetail number one sleep\nI do want to diverge from you a little\nbit on some things but sleep is probably\nnot one of them oh well feel free I mean\nyou're the one that worked 100.\n120 hours a week sleeping much then I\ncan't imagine unless unless you lived in\na different reality than I do\num uh you know and there are times in my\ncareer where I was pulling all-nighters\nand sleep deprived there's just it I\ndon't recommend it but I did it yeah I\nhope you don't do that anymore no longer\nif I can avoid it but there were years\nmany years where it was like all right\nhere we go and I'm quite\num\nAdept at it for one cycle yeah but two\nnights I kind of start to fall fall\napart totally yeah so I would say sleep\nalcohol High perceived stress and I'd\nlove to talk about maybe\num the date on telomeres and what we\nknow so you'd like to see people get\nenough sleep so don't don't just yeah\nnot all of these are concordant so um\nnot enough sleep too much alcohol too\nmuch perceived stress\neating the wrong Foods\ntoxic relationships\nand isolation and then number six\num\nnot moving enough or not moving and\nexercising in a way that really fits\nwith your body so we start with that one\nactually just because it's such a and\nthen work backwards um uh that's\ninteresting I I\nthink nowadays people appreciate the\nneed for quote unquote cardio I know\nthat the the exercise physiologists\ncringe and and dissolve into a puddle of\nTears when I say that but getting the\nheart rate up over some period of time\nlonger than 10 minutes\nin order to generate cardiovascular\nhealth circulation so and resistance\ntraining of some kind maybe flexibility\nwhat do you mean by Body phenotype or\nand exercise I'll speak from personal\nexperience so what I did through I mean\nI gave up my 20s to Medicine\nand during that time I occasionally got\nto the gym you know at UCSF on Parnassus\nyou could go to the gym and then as soon\nas your beeper went off you're back into\nthe hospital\nbut I didn't exercise much I had um do\nyou remember Nordic tracks I had a\nNordic Track in my house and that was\nthat was like it what I believe because\nfor me the primary\noutcome that I'm interested in is\ncardiometabolic health\nso when it comes to exercise what I\nreally feel\nif we're going to be at a population\nlevel\nI feel that about a third cardio\ntwo-thirds resistance training is based\non my synthesis of the literature the\nbest combination\nand I think there's you know as you\ndescribed with your sign\num study I think there's a minimal\neffective dose which for a population is\nabout 150 minutes I think most of us\nneed a lot more than that per week per\nweek but I think you know for me\nbecause I have a phenotype that\nproduces a lot of insulin kind of\ndepending on\nhow I'm on my game I have a lot of\nglucose so I have to exercise a lot more\nto dispose that glucose so I think you\nthen have to move from medicine for the\npopulation or prescriptions for the\npopulation to what works for the\nindividual\nI think that recommendation is fantastic\num I think resistance training well let\nme put it this way I'm neither a trainer\nnor a physician but I've seen in family\nmembers that were doing\nI wouldn't say a lot of cardio but just\ncardio that when they add resistance\ntraining everything in terms including\ntheir biomarkers\num have improved dramatically yes in\nparticular for female members of my\nfamily well one of the one of the\nmediators that I think is important\nespecially for people who do what I call\nchronic cardio which is what I did\nis cortisol\nso we know that\nRunners especially marathon runners\npeople who do a lot of cardio and don't\ndo much resistance training they tend to\nhave much High cortisol levels and you\ncan buffer that with vitamin C vitamin C\ncan decrease the effect but\nchronic cardio doesn't always serve\npeople so quick personal example when I\nfirst started measuring hormone panels\nin myself I went to my physician and I\nsaid I'm 35. I've had one kid I want to\nhave another kid\nI've never been so exhausted in my life\nI just feel like I'm pushing a rock up\nthe hill\nI've got this belly fat that I don't\nlike and\num\nI don't want to have sex with my husband\nso\nwhat do you think what can we do about\nthis\nand he offered\na birth control pill\nand an antidepressant oh goodness so I\nleft him and I went to the lab and I ran\na hormone panel and my cortisol was\nthree times what it should have been my\ninsulin was in the 20s I was fasting my\nglucose was 105.\nmy thyroid was mildly abnormal my\nprogesterone was low and that set me on\nthis course of realizing that\nwhat I was doing as a physician taking\ncare especially of women was not getting\nto some of these root causes that are so\nessential and I would say I had to start\nfirst with cortisol\nat that time I was running four miles\nthree times a week four times a week\nthat was just racing my cortisol further\nso that was not the right exercise for\nme I needed more adaptive exercise I\nstarted doing Pilates more yoga that\nhelped to lower my cortisol I mean it\nstarted me on you know changing the way\nI was managing perceived stress and it\nalso changed my supplement Richmond\ncan we talk about that and what the\nmoment you said lowering cortisol\nthought of the two supplements that come\nto mind are\num ashwagandha which I think can\npotently reduce cortisol but I've heard\nsome recommendations about cycling it\nand I've always wondered about time of\nday for ashwagandha intake because sort\nof quote unquote want cortisol elevated\nin the early part of the day yes and we\nknow this\nuh we know you do not want cortisol\npeaking later in the day no you do not\ninterferes with sleep interferes with\nsleep\num and then the other supplement is uh\nrhodiola rosacea do I am I pronouncing\nthat correctly yeah so radiola is very\neffective it's been shown in multiple\nrandomized trials to lower cortisol so\nthat could be very effective what sort\nof doses I've started taking it recently\nby the way and I made a huge mistake I\nlike to make the mistakes first so then\nmy audiences don't make them\num as I was taking it I heard it was an\nadaptogen so I thought oh I'll take it\nbefore resistance training but of course\nyou want the cortisol Peak during\nresistance training because that's going\nto set in motion the Adaptive response\nso I start taking it later in the day\nand it's really improved I would say my\nlate day second half of the day\ncognition this is subjective to be fair\nI just feel like I'm in a more even\nplane of attention in the second half of\nthe day so you're describing an NF1\nexperiment right which is organic data\nwell it is not anecdotal so I was taught\nat Harvard Medical School that the\nhierarchy of evidence starts at the\nlowest with expert opinion you know case\nstudies then you've got cohort studies\nand you've got\nobservational data that's prospective\nthen you have randomized trial but the\nhighest quality evidence of all is the\nend of one experiment where you serve as\nyour own control\nso what you're describing with rhodiola\nI would frame that as an end of one\nexperiment where you have a washout\nperiod and you compare before and after\nand I'd like to measure some other\nmetrics to see if there's an effect\nincluding your cortisol so radial has\nbeen shown in multiple randomized trials\nto reduce cortisol\nthe other thing that I think is super\neffective is phosphatidylserine PS for\nshort\nfish oil also more modestly reduces\ncortisol\nashwagandha is interesting so in my\nfirst book the hormone cure\nwhich I read by the way you did I did I\nwas hoping that was the one you read I\ndid I read it and it's spectacular and I\nthought going into it I had this like\nyou know let's just call it what it was\nit's called male bias like is there\ngoing to be anything in here for me\nbecause uh I'm I don't have ovaries and\nyou know it's gonna be and it was\nimmensely informative\num so thank you yeah I have very fun\nRecollections of the the walks I took\nlistening to it and then I own the print\nversion too so I like to switch back and\nforth so thank you for that it's a it's\na superb book for anyone to read yeah\nyeah I so appreciate that\nso\nin chapter four you may or may not\nremember that ashwagandha at least the\ntime that I wrote that book\nashwagandha's data is not great but lack\nof proof is not proof against so with\nashwagandha most of the data comes from\nthousands of years of using it in\nayurvedic medicine and it's considered\nagain not my science hat it's considered\na double adaptogen so that it's\npotentially helpful when you are a high\ncortisol phenotype like I was like I\nsometimes still am\nor low cortisol\nI haven't found that in my patients\nalthough I'll give you one exception\nso ashwagandha is mostly based on animal\nstudies there's not as much human data\nbut it is used a ton in Integrative\nMedicine\nthe\num there's one supplement that I found\nto be incredibly helpful for people who\ntend to have high cortisol at night\nand that's called a cortisol manager\nit's by integrative Therapeutics\nI don't have a second\num supplement manufacturer that makes\nsomething similar it's their number one\nselling supplement because it's so\neffective is it a cocktail of several\nthings it's a combination of\nphosphatidylserine and ashwagandha so\ntell me more about phosphatidylserine I\nam familiar with it for it's been\nmentioned by some guests that were on\nthe Tim Ferriss podcast long ago for\nother reasons I think related to sleep\nyes um and maybe that's another reason\nwhy you like it um but before we move on\nfrom rhodiola is there a dosage of\nrhodiola rosacea that you um so I would\nrefer people to my book because the\nrandomized trials and the doses that\nwere used are in there so I can't\nremember with rhodiola although I took\nit this morning to prepare to be with\nyou yeah we can look it up and put a\nshow note caption so I can remember the\ndose with phosphatidyl serum because I\ntake that regularly so 400 to 800\nmilligrams is the typical dose for PS\nand what's interesting is that in the\nrandomized trials that were done\n400 milligrams was more effective than\n800 milligrams interesting I've found\nthat for several supplements that the\nlower dose was more effective yes\num yeah I won't it doesn't matter what\nthose were and so when you say PS you\nwere referring to by the way folks not\nPCOS just because\nscientists and clinicians are familiar\nwith and Military very familiar with\nacronyms uh phosphatidylserion PSO 400\nto 800 milligrams 400 being more\neffective taken later in the day or\nearly day does it matter it depends on\nwhen your cortisol is high so for me I\ntend to you know what's the pattern for\ncortisol typically it rises to its peak\n30 to 60 minutes after you get up then\nit has this gradual kind of asymptotic\ndecline until you go to bed\nso if you're someone like me who Peaks\nlike way crazy high I don't do that\nanymore but that's what I used to do I\nneeded phosphatidylserine in the morning\nfor people who are high at night who\nhave what's known as a\na flat cortisol pattern or a inverted\npattern you want to take it at night\nand the flat pattern just quick sidebar\nis that that's associated with a number\nof conditions that most mainstream\nPhysicians don't know about so a flat\npattern where it's low in the morning\nand it's high at night is associated\nwith anxiety depression\nuh decreased survival from breast cancer\nthat was studied at Stanford by David\nSpiegel that's that he was my\num collab close even collaborator even\nuh on the breath work study that we oh\ninteresting yeah he's our associate\nchair of Psychiatry now so a wonderful\nhuman being has amazed has been a guest\non this podcast and and I'm now\nfantasizing about a conversation that\nincludes uh a panel of of uh Incredible\nMinds like you and David from the\nclinical side so in any case um yeah the\nlate shifted cortisol not good not good\nand it seems to have the worst\nimmune Downstream\nissues of any of the cortisol patterns\nso that's really important to know about\nbecause it then maps to things like\num\nit's related to PTSD\nso that's the pattern we see like in\nvets who've got PTSD as well as others\nit maps to autoimmunity it maps to\nfibromyalgia\nI was told that 1 in 12 people\num have are heterozygous so one mutant\ncopy or a hypomorphic for some some\nmutation in adrenal related genes so\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia is that\ntrue and if so that means that 1 in 12\npeople walking around are cranking out\nfar too much cortisol or not enough\ncortisol or the cortisol system is\nalready skewed in a direction that makes\nlife more challenging at the levels\nwe're talking about\num did I hear that correctly because\nthat 1 in 12 is not a small number it's\nnot a small number it fits with what I\nsee clinically\nI mean I want to see that data just to\nsee\num what does that mean and could you\nmodulate it with environmental\ninfluences but it certainly fits with\nwhat I see you know I was taught once\nagain in mainstream medicine that in\nterms of adrenal function\nit's very binary how most clinicians\nthink about it you either have Addison's\ndisease and you don't make enough\ncortisol or you've got cushions or\nCushing weed pattern and you make too\nmuch cortisol and anything in the middle\nis normal and my experience is that hell\nno like there are those of us like me\nwho make a lot of cortisol I don't have\ncushions maybe I've got one of these I\nwouldn't call it a mutant Gene I would\ncall it more of a\nvulnerable Gene so maybe I have one of\nthose maybe that's part of the reason\nwhy I make you know two to three times\nwhat I should be I'm aware of certain\ngroups of individuals from within the\nmilitary sector that\num have there's a more frequent\noccurrence of\nsome mutation in CCH congenital adrenal\nhyper prevention not necessarily two\ncopies which will if people look that up\nthey're going to go oh wow there's all\nthese phenotypes and\num but sort of hypomorphic type thing so\nyou know less than or too much cortisol\nand they are very good at staying up\nmultiple days per night right multiple\nnights in the series so they can pull\nall-nighters very easily yeah they can\npush harder when most people would quit\nand everyone thinks well that's a great\nphenotype to have but guess what it's\nbecause they hyper produce cortisol yeah\nand um so that's interesting and I think\nif we were to panel medical students and\ngraduate students and you would look at\nyou know who's pulling excessively long\nhours who's stressed out a lot even\noutside of Academia and medicine and\npushing pushing pushing really hard I\nthink the ability to push and not crash\nwe think of it as adaptive but in some\nsense it's maladaptive over a series of\nyears which is sort of what you\ndescribed earlier yeah it's such a good\npoint because\nyou know you in some ways you want to\nselect for that in certain professions\nlike in the military like in medicine\num\nbut I would wonder for those folks about\nthe downstream consequences of producing\nso much cortisol oh it's got to be\ndetrimental for their health it's got to\nbe in the long run and and you see that\nbut even the data shows that if you're\nsomeone like me who makes a lot of\ncortisol\nhigher rates of depression like 50 of\npeople with major depression have high\ncortisol levels higher rates of suicide\num much more metabolic dysfunction we\nknow that trauma as an example maps to\nan increased risk of glucose metabolism\nissues and certainly High cortisol does\nthat because it's one of the jobs of\ncortisol is to manage a glucose\nand it's\nit kind of sets you up for\num this one\nnumber five which is toxic relationships\nyou know someone who hyper produces\ncortisol it's hard to live with someone\nlike that it's also I would say people\nthat have this\num let's just call it biological\nresilience\nit's not always adaptive because you can\nstay in bad circumstances longer the\nability to to crash\nprovided it's not suicide or life life\ndestroying or you know long Arc of\nof pause and the requirement to you know\ntake two years off from work or school\nor something\num the ability to keep pressing on is a\ndouble-edged sword let's put it that way\num I want to make sure in staying within\nthis conversation uh because you\nmentioned Foster dial serine we talked\nabout rhodiola rosacea we talked a bit\nabout ashwagandha you've also talked\nabout Omega-3s and fish oil in\nparticular I'd love to know your\nfavorite sources of these I think\nnowadays there's more General acceptance\nthat getting these essential fatty acids\nis important do you have a threshold\nlevel of sort of grams I I've encouraged\nuh\num podcast listeners to consider\ndepending on what they're eating to try\nand get a gram of EPA or more per day\ndoes that seem excessive and what are\nthe real data on epa's because then the\ncardiovascular experts always hit back\nand say oh no you know it's not good for\ncardiovascular health and then you go oh\nit's better than antidepressants and\nother studies and they go no so I feel\nlike if you really want to make your\nlife difficult if you want to raise your\ncortisol you go on Twitter and you say\nsomething positive about Omega-3s and\nfish oil and\num and you learn a lot\num what are your thoughts on Omega-3s I\ntake a lot of them I've always been a\nbig fan yeah so this is where I\npersonalize I think some people need\nmore than others and what I do is I\nmeasure your level so this gets back to\nnutritional testing so for you I would\nsuggest an Omega Quant or one of my\nfavorite cardiometabolic panels is to do\na Cleveland heart lab so I think they\nthey give me the most reliable\ninformation not just for lipids and\nsubclasses and you know NMR\nfractionation but it also gives me an\ninsulin resistance score it gives me\num levels of Omega-3s great we'll\nprovide links to these different sites\nso that people but one quick thing about\nthat the whole story is not Omega-3s and\ntaking fish oil so the work of Charlie\nSirhan at the Brigham is showing that\nthe way that we resolve inflammation\nour understanding of it is really I\nthink in the learning to crawl stage and\nso if you look at the omega-3 6 pathway\nin the body\nfish oils can help you know kind of push\nthe reactions in a particular direction\nbut typically they're not enough for the\nresolution of inflammation now what most\npeople do including my MBA players is\nthey pop an ibuprofen or something like\nthat when they've got inflammation\nthat's got lots of other side effects\nthat are not so good for you and we know\nin terms of the resolution of\ninflammation that taking something like\nibuprofen reduces the amplitude of\ninflammation by about 50 percent but\nthen it potentially blocks the complete\nresolution of inflammation\nso there's these new supplements that\nyou may have heard of called specialized\npro-resolving mediators there's a lot of\ndifferent supplement companies that make\nthem and that combined with fish oil\nseems to be the best combination and\nwhat I do for athletes who've got you\nknow kind of the normal aches and pains\nof the training load they have is all\ncombine a little aspirin\nsmall dose just like 81 milligrams or\ntwo of those baby aspirin together with\nfish oil plus specialized pro-resolving\nmediators and there's some that are NSF\nthey're certified for sports but the\nthe dose I would say with my patients\nsome of them only need\na thousand milligrams your Gram that you\nmentioned for the population some of\nthem need\nsix grams together with spms\nso I think it has to be personalized\nhow young\num\nis it okay for\npeople to start taking Omega-3s for\ninstance young women and their teens\npeople in their 20s and their 30s young\nguys in their 20s and 30s should they\ntake fish oil if just as a assuming\nthey're not going to get anything tested\nI'm thinking about the college student\nwho is really into biomarkers and that\nsort of thing we'll go do some of this\num\nbut many people won't but they want to\ndo the right thing so they'll try and\ndrink a little less hopefully hopefully\nthey won't smoke or vape please don't\nsmoke or vape the idea that vaping is\nokay it's like we had it was so bad so\nbad for everything we're talking about\nlet's end that it's like exactly so just\nyou know avoid hopefully they'll try and\navoid those things hopefully they'll\navoid hard drugs\num hopefully they'll avoid getting any\nSTIs if they do they'll resolve them\nquickly hopefully yes um so but they\nmight say oh well okay I'm willing to\nyou know take some magnesium or take\nsome phosphodel serine buffer my\ncortisol eat some vegetables\num should they consider taking fish oil\nas a kind of across-the-board\ninoculatory thing so I put to rank order\nthese I would say fish oil yes\nI think a thousand milligrams as a\ngeneral recommendation is good but I\nalso have a food first philosophy so my\npreference would be that they're having\nsalmon or some kind of Smash fish and\nthey're getting that as the primary\nsource of their Omega-3s and then the\ndays that they don't have fish I\nrecommend it probably twice a week that\nthey take fish oil then I would put\nmagnesium next since so many people are\ndeficient then I'd probably put vitamin\nD\nwhat how many IU of vitamin D per day\nwell you keep asking me this like for\nthe the population yeah well for the let\nme put it this way for the laze for the\nlazy person\nor and this is an or not an and or the\nperson who\num just doesn't have the finances to go\nget measured yeah levels measured\nbecause you know our audience is a huge\nrange we've got people who can have tons\nof disposable income that list in the\nspot we have people have no disposable\nincome so a thousand to two thousand\ninternational units but my you know what\nI do is I dose to a serum level that's\nbetween about 50 and 90. great and so I\nhave a vitamin D receptor\nuh snip and so I need to take about 5\n000 a day to get to what I need a lot of\npeople don't need that\nand you know there's some supplements\nthat\nI don't know if they need so you\nmentioned phosphatidylserine for someone\nwho's a college student and their\ncortisol is completely normal they're\nwasting their money on PS they don't\nneed it they might need it later but\nthey don't need it now I'd like to make\nsure that we Circle back to birth\ncontrol in particular oral contraceptive\nbirth control\nand we should touch on iuds perhaps\na little bit more but what are your\nthoughts on sort of pure estrogen birth\ncontrol this is what I learned when I\nwas in college is that birth control is\nbasically tonic estrogen so constantly\ntaking estrogen estrogen women are\ntaking estrogen so that they don't get\nthe estrogen\npriming of progesterone you're not\ngetting any ovulation and I've known\nwomen that have been taking oral Contra\nor that took oral contraception as like\nestrogen\npills basically for 5 10 15 years are\nthere long-term consequences of this as\nit relates to pregnancy PCOS\nmenopause what if so what are some of\nthose consequences\num\nwhat are your concerns what do you like\nabout oral contraceptives what do you\ndislike about them\nI like how balanced you ask that\nquestion so\nwomen who take oral contraceptives as\nlong as you're describing like 10 years\nor longer we call those Olympic oral\ncontraceptive users\nin terms of benefit I think that\nespecially when they first came out and\neven now it gives women reproductive\nchoice and That's essential\nas you may know a reproductive Choice\nhas been declining recently so I'm a big\nfan in that regard and we've got a lot\nof data to show both the risks and also\nthe benefits of it\nso I'll speak first into the benefits\nbecause\nuh I'm gonna get on a soapbox a little\nbit about the risks so we know that it\nreduces the risk of ovarian cancer so\nthere's something about this idea of\nincessant ovulation that is not good for\nthe female body\nso if you look at for instance women who\nare nuns\nwho don't take oral contraceptives and\nthey have a period every single month of\ntheir reproductive lives they have a\ngreater risk of a brain cancer\nso if you look then at women who have uh\nseveral babies and they've got a period\nof time when they're pregnant that\nthey're not ovulating and then they\nbreastfeed for some period of time they\nhave a lower risk of ovarian cancer so\noral contraceptives help with reducing\novulation and reducing risk we know that\nif you take the oral contraceptive for\nabout five years it reduces your risk of\novarian cancer by 50 and that's\nsignificant because\nwere so poor at diagnosing ovarian\ncancer early there's really no method\nthat's really effective we use ca125 and\nultrasound screen especially in women\nwho are at greater genetic risk but even\nthat often we diagnose it you know in a\nlater stage maybe just because that\nstatement is going to highlight for a\nnumber of people the question of what\nare some of the some earliest symptoms\nthat people can recognize without a\nblood test so as ovarian cancer is it\ngoing to be pain\nso the problem is the symptoms are so\nvague and they're so non-specific one of\nthe most common symptoms is bloating\nand we've already talked about\nconstipation we've talked about how\nwomen have this longer track GI tract\nand so bloating is a really common\nexperience for most women\nyou can have bulk symptoms you know\nfeeling like your your lower belly is\nkind of pressed out\nso\nthe way that we\ninform women in terms of watching for\nthis is to get regular gynecologic exams\nfor women who are at high risk where\nthey have for instance an ultrasound for\nsome reason it shows a mass that we're\nconcerned about there's a way to triage\nthat in terms of what kind of evaluation\nthat they need and that's the situation\nwhere you might get a blood test called\nthe ca129\nCA 125.\nthe um yeah the problem is the symptoms\nare so vague it could be it depends on\nhow big the tumor is how much bulk you\nhave what it's pressing on\nso if\num taking estrogen and thereby reducing\nthe frequency of ovulation\nlowers the risk of ovarian cancer should\nwomen that are even women who are not\nsexually active so they're they're not\nactively trying to get pregnant or avoid\ngetting pregnant but if they're not\nsexually active then the probability of\nconceiving unless they go through some\nIUI or some other route is is very low\nas far as I know\num so I was taught in high school anyway\num\nwould they be wise to suppress ovulation\nfor periodically using hormone-based\ncontraception just so that they can\noffset the risk of ovarian cancer that's\na very rational question and I would say\nthat's what mainstream medicine has had\nat its back to recommend oral\ncontraceptives not just for women who\nare seeking contraception but\nfor acne for painful periods for really\nkind of the drop of a hat they're\nprescribing oral contraceptives that's\nwhat I was taught to do\nbut there are so many consequences and I\nthink the issue here is more about\nconsent because\nin OB GYN and I started out as a\nboard-certified ob gyn and I now mostly\nsee men but I was taught as an OB GYN to\nconvince women to go on the oral\ncontraceptive and I think a lot of that\nis pharmaceutical influence\nso maybe we could talk about the risks\nand why the answer is no to your\nquestion\num as we do that could I just ask is the\num the so-called ring the new it used to\nbe called The nuva Ring maybe that's a\nbrand name but when I was in college\nthere was all this discussion about the\nring all right by both men and women for\nreasons that don't belong on the podcast\num use your imagination folks so\num is the the ring obviously it's not\noral it's not oral hormone contraception\nbut it's hormone based right the rate is\nreleasing estrogen locally as opposed to\ntaking it orally but would you would you\nslot it under what you're about to tell\nus in terms of the concerns\nso we have less data about the ring\nso the oral contraceptive is two\nhormones it's ethanyl estradiol\nand it's a progestin so it's not the\nnormal\nuh progesterone that your body makes\nsuch ovaries make and your adrenals make\nit is a synthetic form of\nprogesterone\nand it is the same\nprogestin similar same class that was\nshown to be dangerous and provocative in\nthe women's health initiative so I'm not\na fan of progestins I do not recommend\nthem for any woman unless the\nconsequence of not taking them is\nsurgery or some other\num\nyou know unless it gives them some\nfreedom in some way so I don't like\nProtestants the uh nuva ring is estrogen\nplus progestin but it's released\ntransdermally through the vagina\nso\ngiven the the way that\num it's delivered to the vagina\nthe doses are lower than what's taken\norally\nbut in terms of some of the risks that\nI'm about to talk about we don't know\nabout much of the data we think that\nit's similar there's probably a spectrum\nof risk and maneuvering is a little more\ntowards the middle than you know what\nI'm talking about with oral\ncontraceptives\nare you ready for that yeah I'm ready\nfor the risks okay\nso like with almost any pharmaceutical\nthe oral contraceptive depletes certain\nmicronutrients\nso magnesium there's certain vitamin B's\nthat are depleted\nuh\nit also affects the microbiome that data\nis not as strong but there seems to be\nsome effect and there's also an\nincreased risk of inflammatory bowel\ndisease in autoimmune condition\nit increases inflammatory tone\nso the studies that I've seen increase\none of the markers of inflammatory tone\nHigh sensitivity CRP by about two to\nthree x\nit seems to make the hypothalamic\npituitary adrenal axis more rigid\nso that you can't kind of roll with the\npunches and Wax and Wane in terms of\ncortisol production the way that you can\noff the birth control pill\nit can affect thyroid function\nI'm thinking of the slide that I have\nthat has like 10 problems associated\nwith oral contraceptive but that's what\nI can remember right now that's very\nhelpful and it makes me wonder whether\nor not if on the one hand oral\ncontraceptives are protective in women\nit's ovarian cancer but then they have\nthese other issues yeah there's one\nother I want to mention please\nanytime you take oral estrogen it raises\nsex hormone by Nick globulin and you've\ntalked to other podcast guests about\nthis Kyle I think sex hormone binding\nglobulin I think of as a sponge that\nsoaks up free estrogen and free\ntestosterone so when you go on the birth\ncontrol bill you raise your sex hormone\nbinding globulin it soaks up especially\nfree testosterone\nand for some women it's not a big deal\nthey don't notice much of a difference\nbut then there's a phenotype maybe\nrelated to CAG repeats on the Androgen\nreceptor\nwho are exquisitely sensitive to that\ndecline in free testosterone so this\nthen opens the portal of talking a\nlittle bit about testosterone in women\nso we've mentioned already that it's the\nmost abundant biologically the most\nabundant hormone in the female system\neven though men make almost 10 times as\nmuch or even more than 10 times it is so\nimportant for women it is essential to\nso many things not just sex drive and\nmuscle mass and seeing a response to\nresistance training but also confidence\nin agency\nand so those women who are so sensitive\nto their testosterone level they've got\nthis high sex hormone binding globulin\ntheir testosterone declines\nwhat they describe is vaginal dryness\nmaybe a decline in sex drive but there's\nalso this bigger issue related to\nconfidence in agency even risk-taking\nfrom studies that we've done with MBA\nstudents that I think is a serious\nproblem\nmaybe the most important out of all of\nthese things is that it can shrink the\nclitoris by up to 20 percent\ntwenty percent and that includes the\nregression of the of the nerves that\ninnervate the the clitoris is that I\nmean that's a very good question as a\nneuroscientist yeah I would think uh I\nused to teach uh the neural side of of\nreproductive Health we need to do a\nseries on Sexual Health maybe you would\nco-host that with me\nwe could certainly use your expertise I\nthink um yeah that's a dramatic that's\ninteresting number yeah but then let's\ngo back to the sacred marketing if I've\ngot a woman that I think should not be\non the birth control pill maybe she's\ntaking it for acne or she's taking it\nbecause her periods were a little\npainful what I'm going to do is say\nlet's leverage these other ways of\nmaking your period less painful let's\ntake the message of your painful periods\nand figure out okay it's your\ninflammatory tone and we give you some\nfish oil and spms maybe a little aspirin\nwhen you've got your period like let's\nfind some other ways to deal with it\nthen to take the oral contraceptive\nwhich you have not received informed\nconsent about because it can trick your\n by up to 20 now that usually\nconvinces most people to come reversible\nthe elevation in sex hormone binding\nglobulin does not seem to go away when\nyou come off the birth control pill\nto me that is the biggest problem with\nprescribing oral contraceptives now the\ndata that we have is limited there's one\nwoman who uh Claudia has something\nsomething who looked at sex hormone\nbinding globulin a year out from\nstopping the birth control pill and it\nwas still elevated it wasn't as high as\nit was when they were on the pill but it\nwas still elevated so your question\nabout reversibility\nI don't know if we know the answer to\nthat\nwow okay\num\nthat's yeah that's a significant\nstatement\nand something that for consideration\nrelated to this although this might seem\nnot related it is\nhow early do you recommend that women go\nget their\nfollicle number assessed in other words\nto get a size a sense of the size of the\novarian reserve and their amh levels\nmeasured um\nI'm gonna I'm an amateur Outsider as I\nsay this but we have an episode on a\nfertility where I just described the\novulatory menstrual cycle yeah\num and I'm not the best person to answer\nthat yeah well I'm too far out from it\nokay well um I suppose then from taking\nthe perspective of somebody who thinks\nabout fertility it in terms of at least\ncongruent with vitality and Longevity\ngiven that it's fairly non-invasive it's\nan ultrasound or a blood draw for amh or\nboth\nis there any reason why a woman would\nnot want to get her follicle number\nassessed or her amh levels assessed is\nthere any reason\nwhy because I was shocked to learn that\nmost women don't do this until they're\nhitting their late 30s or early 40s and\nyeah they're having conceived or they\nsuddenly decide that they want to\nconceive and I thought why doesn't every\ndoctor insist that their female patients\nget have their amh level\naddressed so that if they need to freeze\neggs cost it's cost yeah so I think if\nyou've got the disposable income to do\nit go for it it's not included in a\nstandard blood panel no wow the only\nwomen in my practice who've had amhs\ndone and have looked at their follicle\ncount are women who\nwant to freeze their eggs or and that\nrequires disposable income or they\num are having trouble getting pregnant\nso they are in the reproductive\nEndocrinology system and they're getting\nan evaluation and then they're also\num the women who have symptoms of early\nmenopause so premature ovarian\ninsufficiency which is before age 40.\nuh those are the women that I see\ngetting attested and I think you're\nright that it should be offered more\nbroadly it speaks to the democratization\nof data again\nand I think most women don't know that\nso you're doing a huge service I think\nto be speaking into this\none other point related to that is that\nwhat I see in conventional medicine\nis that when a woman asks for a hormone\npanel\nand she's not trying to get pregnant she\nusually gets told\nthat hormones vary too much\nit's a waste of money you don't need it\nor if you're feeling hormonal why don't\nyou go on a birth control pill\nunless she's trying to get pregnant\nif she's trying to get pregnant suddenly\nthose same tests are very reliable and\nthey get you know their their\ntestosterone their free testosterone\ntheir thyroid panel they get their\nestrogen and progesterone maybe they get\ntheir cortisol they get their amh so\nthere's a double standard\nbetween those who want to get pregnant\nand those who don't and that needs to\nend\nI totally agree as I've learned more\nabout\num ovulatory cycle and amh and and the\nantral population of follicles on it\nit's fascinating it just seems to me wow\na relatively straightforward test one\ndefinitely invasive ultrasound but I\ndon't consider that yeah that's not I'm\nnot terribly invasive but invasive uh at\nleast but the other one just pure blood\ntest just seems like why wouldn't I\nwouldn't this be offered or covered by\ninsurance or or you know that anyone\nthat wanted but now now I understand why\nyou mentioned menopause\nhuge topic enormous topic we had a guest\non the podcast who's not a clinician who\nsaid something in passing so I wanna I'm\nlikely to get this wrong\num but what they said was that the\nresults of the large-scale trials on\nhormone replacement therapy for women\nfor menopause said something to the\neffect of if the hormone therapy was\nstarted early enough it was very\nbeneficial for yes vitality and health\noutcomes whereas if women\nwent through menopause and then\ninitiated the hormone therapy\nhormone replacement therapy that it\ncould be detrimental to their health\nso first of all do I recall that\nstatement correctly and then second of\nall what sorts of hormones are being\nreplaced is it just estrogen and how is\nthat done is it done through birth\ncontrol so oral contraceptives nuvarings\nwhat are your thoughts on menopause when\nshould people start thinking about it\nand what is the\npalette of things available so that we\ncan do an entire episode with you on on\nthis topic in the future but just to I\nyou know I get a lot of questions about\nthis and and I'm guessing based on\neverything you've told me today that\nthere are women in their 30s that while\nthey may be 20 years out from menopause\nprobably should be doing things now in\nanticipation of that yes so we haven't\ntalked about the 30 something but I\ntotally agree with you the more you know\nabout your phenotype your hormonal\nphenotype when you're in your 30s you're\nset up in terms of what to do in the\nfuture especially things like your\nthyroid your estrogen and progesterone\nlevels because you can replace\nto a state of Youth thyroid\nwhatever that is for you\nyou can replace I don't usually go\nexactly back to where the estrogen and\nprogesterone levels were but we can get\npretty close so in your 30s having a\nbase case I think is really essential\nso you spoke to the Women's Health\nInitiative which was published in 2002\nand we went from a huge number of women\ntaking hormone therapy to a very small\npercentage like in the range of five\npercent\nand that means we've got millions\nmillions of women who are suffering\nneedlessly with things like insomnia\ndifficulty with their mood difficulty\nwith sex drive feeling like they are\nclosing the store in terms of sex\nbecause they're not on hormone therapy\nI would agree with the statement that\nyou made that hormone therapy particular\nforms that are similar to what your body\nalways made when it's given judiciously\nat the right time\ntypically within five to ten years of\nmenopause which is 51 to 52 that it is\nincredibly safe so\nit's a complicated study the women's\nhealth initiative but it was the the\nwrong study in the wrong patients\nwith the wrong medications\nand\num with some of the wrong outcomes so it\nwas powered to look at cardiovascular\noutcomes it was not powered to look at\nbreast cancer it was stopped because of\nbreast cancer risk but what happened in\nthe control arm of the study was that\nthey had an incredibly low rate of\nbreast cancer\nand so as a result they ended up having\nthis increased risk of breast cancer at\nfive years and they stopped the study\nnow the study was done with synthetics\nit was done with conjugated equine\nestrogen known as Premarin and medroxy\nprogesterone acetate those were the\nso-called estrogen and progesterone\nthose are synthetic hormones we think\nespecially the progestin is associated\nwith the greater risk of breast cancer\nalthough the the subsequent\nre-evaluations of the data now 18 years\nout have shown that\num\nthis problem with the control group and\nno increased risk of breast cancer\num\nand for the women who got estrogen only\nthose who had a hysterectomy the\nPremarin they actually had a decreased\nbreast cancer risk and decreased breast\ncancer mortality\nso there's a lot to be said about this\nI'm trying to keep it really brief\nbut if you look at the women 50 to 60 So\nwithin 10 years of menopause they're the\nones who seem to have the greatest\nbenefit\nso they had a decreased subclinical\natherosclerosis so less cardiovascular\ndisease they had an improvement in terms\nof bone health\num less progression to diabetes and then\nover the age of 60 they started to have\ngreater risk of certain outcomes such as\ncardiovascular disease myocardial\ninfarction and so on\nyou asked about\num\nwhat do I do\nand\nto me this problem is not just menopause\nwhat's more interesting is to talk about\nperimenopause\nso perimenopause is the the period of\ntime before your final menstrual cycle\nand for most women depending on how it's\ntuned you are to the symptoms it can\nlast for 10 years so I'm still in Period\nmenopause it's been like 20 years\nbecause I've been tracking it so\ncarefully\nit usually gets kicked off by having\nyour cycle get closer together so that\ncould happen in your 30s or your 40s you\ngo from 28 days to 25 days that sort of\nthing you may notice that you start\nsleeping more poorly because\nprogesterone is so important you talked\nabout that with Kyle\nyou may notice it as more anxiety\ndifficulty is sleeping and that probably\nis related to the estrogen receptor so\nyour Alpha is estrogen receptor Alpha is\nanxio\nit increases anxiety\nER beta is associated with an anxiolytic\nactivity and then there's a total of\nabout six estrogen receptors now there's\nthe the g-protein-coupled estrogen\nreceptors and those are mixed anxiolytic\nanxiogenic\nso um there's this whole period of\nperimenopause and what's Most\nFascinating to me and we've got to talk\nabout this either today or another time\nis that there is this massive massive\nchange that happens in the female brain\nthat people are not talking about enough\nand so looking at the work of Lisa\nMoscone at Cornell\nfrom uh starting around age 40. there is\nthis massive change in cerebral\nmetabolism so you can do fdg pet scans\nyou can look at glucose uptake and\nthere's about\non average a 20 decline from\npre-menopause\nyou know up to like age 35\nto perimenopause to post menopause\nthe women who are having the most\nsymptoms in perimenopause menopause The\nHot Flashes the night sweats the\ndifficulty of sleeping those are the\nones who have the most significant\ncerebral hypomatabolism\nso it's almost like a\num I don't I don't want to scare people\nwith this language but it's a\nlow level or let's call it pseudo\ndementia of sorts yes it it seems to be\na phenotype that you can then map\nto Alzheimer's disease because that's\nLisa moscone's work she's looking at\nokay\nAlzheimer's disease is not a disease of\nold age it is disease of middle age what\nare some of the biomarkers that we can\nDefine that can tell you what your risk\nis I've got a mother and a grandmother\nwith Alzheimer's disease you can believe\nI am all over this data and insulin\nresistance it's a huge part of\nsensitivity as we talked about before\num seems to be somewhere in there which\nI think when that first when that idea\nfirst surfaced a few people like really\nbut then of course right I mean the\nbrain is just incredibly metabolically\ndemanding organ\nyou deprive neurons of\nfuel sources they or you make them less\nsensitive to fuel sources they start\ndying they certainly start firing less\nit makes perfect sense and I think now\nit's thanks to Lisa's work work that\nyou've you've done and talked about\nquite a lot is um in your books and\nelsewhere I think has really you know\nhighlighted for people that\nmetabolism and metabolomics is going to\nbe as important as genes and genomics\nwhen it comes that's right dementia\nperhaps especially in women is it safe\nto say that I think I think so because\nwe believe that this system is regulated\nby estrogen\nso the decline in estrogen starting\naround age 40 43 is kind of the average\nseems to be the driver behind cerebral\nhypomatabolism the way I describe it to\nmy patients is\nit's like slow brain energy\nso you walk into a room you can't\nremember why like you just notice that\nyou can't manage all the tasks the way\nthat you once could like things are just\na little slower\nand I say that to women and they're like\nI have that like help me\nso this is then circling back to Whi\nwhere women are scared to death of\ntaking hormone therapy and we've got all\nof these women that are Marching toward\npotentially a greater risk of\nAlzheimer's disease and they have this\nopportunity in their 40s and their 50s\nto take hormone therapy and they may not\nbe offered it\nbecause the typical conventional\napproach based on Whi is to say\nunless you're having hot flashes and\nnight sweats that are severe I'm not\ngoing to give you hormone therapy and I\nI just want to call that out I would say\nno that is not the way to approach it\nfurther\nthe concept right now in conventional\nmedicine is that hot flashes and night\nsweats are these nuisance symptoms that\nwe will take care of temporarily maybe\nwith a little bit of estrogen\nprogesterone or birth control pill\nbecause it's given a lot or that they\npass or is that this idea you know suck\nit up suck it up\ndoesn't matter that you're not sleeping\nanymore you know turn down the\ntemperature in your room\nand that's not right because\nhot flashes and night sweats are a\nbiomarker\nof cardiometabolic disease they are a\nbiomarker of increased bone loss\nthey are a biomarker of changes in the\nbrain\nso many of these symptoms that occur in\nperimenopause are not driven by the\novaries they are driven by the brain\nyeah it's the the bi-directional\ncrosstalk between the body and the brain\nkeeps you know I think is this\nresounding theme uh we had Chris Palmer\non here a psychiatrist who's talking\nabout ketogenic diet mental health I\nknow uh you we could have a whole other\ndiscussion and we will I hope if you'll\nagree to it about nutrition and as it\nrelates to hormones uh specific diets\nand and so forth but the and that's a\nquestion too whether this problem of\ncerebral hyper metabolism\ncould we solve it with estrogen\nand or increased metabolic flexibility\nso I just wanted to footnote that sorry\nto interrupt you no please uh please\ninterrupt um uh I know Europe as long as\nwe're there I know you are a fan in some\ninstances of intermittent fasting time\nrestricted feeding and or ketogenic diet\nyes\num to get cells sensitive to insulin\nwhich is not to say if I understand\ncorrectly which is not to say that women\nneed to stay on the ketogenic diet for\nlong periods of time\nor intermittent fast for my only time\nrestricted feeding for eight hours or\nsix hours a day but that by increasing\nyou said metabolic flexibility\nexcuse me but by increasing cells\nsensitivity to insulin and then maybe\nreturning to a more typical eating\npattern and periodically switching back\nand forth that might actually benefit be\nbeneficial do I have that right yeah I\nlove the pulse so I feel like it's much\nmore physiologic than say going on a\nketogenic diet and staying there for\nyears all of the data that we have on\nthe ketogenic diet\nit's pretty Limited in terms of duration\nyou know the the longest players that we\nhave in terms of the data are the focus\nwith epilepsy and that's just a\ndifferent phenotype so I think in terms\nof microbiome effects diversity\ndysbiosis some of those issues we really\ndon't know in terms of long-term effects\nso I prefer with a ketogenic diet that\nit's used as an NF1 experiment and that\nto do it for four weeks maybe you\nmeasure biomarkers before and afterwards\nmaybe look at your stool before and\nafterwards we still haven't talked about\nstool tests yet but you could measure\nyour fasting insulin and your glucose\nyou could just start there do four weeks\nof Keto clean keto including vegetables\nit doesn't have to be 57 a day and then\nmeasure it again afterwards\nsince you mentioned a mentioned stool\ntesting yes\nwhat what is your recommendation about\nstool testing\nso my recommendation this is again in\nthe the field of if you have the\ndisposable income so I usually start\nwith Genova because they've got a good\ncopay system with insurance that's what\nI typically use so I usually do their\none day stool test where you have to go\ndigging through your stool and send it\noff to the slab that's in North Carolina\nI usually do the one day unless I'm\nconcerned about parasites in that case I\ntend to do three days I do that for\npeople who travel a fair amount and go\nto places where there's greater risk or\nthey just have gut symptoms\nanother test that I do a lot is\num because I always like to mention two\nLabs is a test by longevity\nand this is much more of a data wonk\nuh type of test because it's powered by\nAI it was designed by\num\na guy who's got inflammatory bowel\ndisease and he is a\num he's a PhD\ndeep phenotyping bioinformatics guy who\nwanted to make this really easy\nso the test is is Under the Umbrella of\nthorn\nand\num they just call it got bio they might\nhave another name for it and they just\nimproved it so that it's just a wipe\ninstead of digging through her stool and\nso my athletes will do it now they were\nnot so into digging through their stool\nbefore is anybody really no one is I\ndon't want the answer\nI know the answer I prefer to that but\nthat's a super interesting test because\nit's\nyou get much more dense data the issue\nis\num with apologies to my friends at\nThorne the issue is that there are\nrecommendations end up being sworn\nsupplements so that can be very easy for\npeople who want to you know connect the\ndots\nthat's not always the way that I like to\ndo it uh first of all\nthree things\num\nyou've shared with us an immense amount\nof knowledge and\nin that first statement I also want to\napologize because I threw at you the\nentire life span of uh female lifespan\nreproductive Health contraception diet\nuh microbiome so many things but\num I first I just want to say\nyou've taught me a tremendous amount\num\nincluding I think something that most\npeople including myself have not thought\nabout enough which is the psychosocial\nimpact on things that we're all familiar\nwith\nconstipation bowel movements what we eat\nwhat we avoid I have to say really a\nhuge thank you for that because\nit's not something that's been discussed\non this podcast before sort of know that\nbrain communicates with body psychology\nand biology are linked but I think this\nis the first time that anyone's ever\ndirectly linked\ncircumstances and biology and psychology\nin such a concrete way so that's that's\nthe first thing and I speak for many\npeople in that second of all\nwe barely scratched the surface of your\nknowledge and um which is both uh\nfrustrating for me because uh it I\nalways want to learn more and I know\nmany other people do as well but also\nvery very exciting because uh with uh\nhopefully without much persuasion we can\nhave you back on to talk about something\nat all like meant uh I know you're\nworking with men now Men's Health\num some particulars around I think\nthere's more for us to explore in terms\nof PCOS menopause contraception and all\nof the above but then something that you\nand I were talking about off camera\num before we started which I think is a\nreally important factor that ties back\nto this issue of of\ntrauma and stress and the bi-directional\nrelationship between biology and\npsychology hopefully someday we won't\neven separate those two\nwhich is the use of specific medicines\nincluding plant medicines yes and how\nthat can influence overall health which\nno doubt will include Hormone Health\nso I say all of that for two reasons\nfirst of all to queue up the\nwe won't even call it a part two but a\nsequel to the to this with\num I'm gratified to hear that you you'll\njoin us for that and then also to just\nreally extend a huge thank you the\namount of knowledge that you shared is\nis immense and uh is going to be very\nvery useful and actionable for for men\nin terms of their thinking and their\nactions and\nfor women in particular today's\ndiscussion in particular for women in\nterms of how to think about their health\nand biology how to think about their\npsychology and the environment that all\nof that's embedded in so I just want to\nsay an enormous thank\nyou thank you Andrew I so appreciate\nthat and I so appreciate\nwhat you offer to the world in terms of\na weigh-in a way to understand\nphysiology and how to craft a architect\na better life\num can I just add one last thing because\nI didn't talk about it since we didn't\nget to the 40s and the 50s and those\nlisted biomarkers so I feel like if\npeople if women went away with one thing\ntoday it would be to do a coronary\nartery calcium score\nby age 45 and sooner if you've got\npremature heart disease how is that\ntaken so it's a CT scan of the chest\nyou can self-order it like I think at\nStanford Hospital you can self-order it\nlast time a patient checked it was 250\nso again disposable income but it it\ntells you it it almost gives you this\nfork in the road in terms of how much\nyou need to pay attention to\ncardiometabolic health as a woman and\nit's uh 45 for men too so if you haven't\nhad one if you had one no you need one\ninsulin cortisol CAC great so I'll run\nall that by you it's really essential\nand it's um\nyeah it's it's so fascinating because\nyou know there's some women who have a\nzero so my score is zero and that's\ngreat so often you can just keep doing\nwhat you're doing but if you're 45 and\nyou're starting to be elevated or you've\ngot you know maybe you've got PCOS or\nyou've got some other biomarkers tending\nyou in this direction toward the number\none killer really\nit's nine out of the top 10 killers in\nthe US\nthat allows you to really start to make\nchanges and I I think it's essential to\nknow that data it's not it's probably\nnot going to be offered by your doctor\ncertainly Peter attia is going to offer\nit but most conventional doctors are not\ngoing to do it and then the last thing I\nwant to say before you mention so if I\nwere to go to my doctor and I just say I\nwant a cardiac calcium score that's what\npeople coronary artery calcium scores\nCAC okay so everyone hear that and know\nthat if you're 40 or older and maybe if\nyou're 45 45 or older get get it\nso the last thing is and this is for men\nand women is there a score\nso adverse childhood experiences knowing\nyour a score is so essential in terms of\na baseline for how much trauma your\nsystem your Pine system endured when you\nwere a kid and we know that childhood\ntrauma whether it's abuse or neglect or\nyou know having an alcoholic parent that\nmaps to disease in middle age and it can\ngive you so much Insight I'll give you\nan example I've got a patient who had an\nelevated coronary artery calcium score\nwho does everything right with her food\nI think it was her trauma that elevated\nher CAC when she was 45. so I think an a\nscore knowing your a score\nstarting as a teenager like knowing it\nand knowing how to work with that is\nreally essential there are certain\npeople they are exceedingly rare but you\nare one such person that when they speak\nknowledge just comes from comes out of\nthem and it's incredibly useful and\nhelpful knowledge so thank you I'm gonna\nget both of those things good\num and I highly recommend everyone else\npursue ways that they can get those or\nif they can't get them that they you\nknow\nYour Mark those as things to get at the\npoint where they they can obtain\nsufficient uh disposable income sounds\nlike that the health uh the detriments\nto health that those can offset would be\nwell worth the cost totally\nthank you thank you for joining me
