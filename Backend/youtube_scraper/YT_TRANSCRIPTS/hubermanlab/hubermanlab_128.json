    "transcript": "[Music]\nwelcome to the huberman lab guest Series\nwhere I and an expert guest discuss\nscience and science-based tools for\neveryday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm our\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOphthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today marks the second episode\nin the sixth episode series with Dr Andy\nGalpin a professor of kinesiology at Cal\nState University Fullerton and one of\nthe foremost world's experts on the\nscience and applications of methods to\nincrease strength hypertrophy and\nendurance today's episode is all about\nhow to increase strength speed and\nhypertrophy of muscles Professor Dr Andy\nGalpin great to be back\nlast episode you told us about the nine\nspecific adaptations that exercise can\ninduce everything from strength and\nhypertrophy to endurance muscular\nendurance so on and so forth and you\ngave us this incredible toolkit of fit\ntests for each of those adaptations so\nthat people can assess them for\nthemselves and then of course improve on\neach and every one of them if they\nchoose\nby the way people can access that\ninformation simply by going to the first\nepisode in this series with you and it's\nall there and time stamped and I highly\nrecommend people do that today we're\ntalking about strength and hypertrophy\nand so right out the gate I just want to\nask you why should people think about\nand train for strengthen hypertrophy and\nthat question is of course directed\ntowards those that are trying to get\nstronger and grow bigger muscles\nbut I know that many people out there\nperhaps have not thought about the\nbenefits of strength and hypertrophy\ntraining and how beneficial it can be\nnot just for people that want to get\nbigger biceps Etc but that have other\ngoals longevity goals and health goals\nunrelated to what most people associate\nwith hypertrophy so what are the\nbenefits of training for strength and\nhypertrophy for the everyday person for\nthe athlete for the recreational\nexerciser and so on there's a wonderful\nsaying I think it was Bill Bowerman the\nfounder one of the founders of Nike and\nhe always said if you have a body or an\nathlete and and I think that's very\nimportant for people to understand\nbecause one of the major disservices\nwe've done in this field is convince\npeople that things like strength\ntraining are for athletes or for growing\nbigger muscles and cardiovascular\ntraining are for things like fat loss\nand heart health\nand that is a tremendous disservice\nbecause it puts a lot of unnecessary\nbarriers and leads to a lot of false\nassumptions and then therefore poor\nactions classic examples of this are\npeople who are resistant to strength\ntraining because they don't want to put\non too much muscle people who only\nperform one type of exercise because\nthey want say fat loss or they're in it\nfor longevity and health and they don't\nwork they're not worried about you know\nbeing an athlete and so right out the\ngates we can actually draw back a little\nbit to what we were our previous\nconversation when I walked you through\nthe history of exercise science and the\nreason I did that is to help you\nunderstand these are the railroads that\nyou're running down and you don't even\nrealize it in terms of everyone thinks\nof strength training and they\nimmediately default to our principles to\noptimize muscle growth and that's not\nthe only adaptation one should be after\nwith strength training when we think of\nendurance training we immediately\ndefault to things like again\ncardiovascular health or fat loss or\nthings like that what I really want to\ndo across this entire series and\nconversations is to to just break that\nimmediately talk about all the other\nthings that you can do with your with\nyour training and so that people can be\ncomfortable and confident in doing an\noptimal training program for whatever\ngoal they have whether that be specific\nlike growing muscle or non-specific like\njust feeling better having more energy\nbeing more prepared for life and\nLongevity and so to directly answer your\nquestion I could really we could do a\nhundred episodes on the benefits of\nexercise and we could run all the way\nfrom mood and focus cognitive tasks to a\nbetter immune function you'll get less\ncolds you'll be you'll fight them off\nmore effectively to mortality right so\nsome of the strongest predictors of how\nlong and how well you will live are\nexercise however\nthere are independent benefits that come\nfrom just endurance training and there\nare independent benefits that come from\nstrength training and so to just give\nyou one categorically the way that you\nwant to think about this is resistance\nexercise and strength training is the\nnumber one tool to combat neuromuscular\naging\nyou cannot get that through any other\nform of exercise besides heavy overload\nstrength training and we and we can walk\nthrough in detail what that is but that\nis reason number one in general human\nmovement is is a function of number one\nsome sort of neuromuscular Activation so\nnerves have to turn on the second part\nis muscles have to contract and the\nthird part is those muscles have to move\na bone all right\nif you want to be alive and you want to\nlive by yourself you have to be able to\nengage in human movement\nif you have\nany dysfunction in the neuromuscular\nsystem there then you're not going to be\nable to do that and again as I mentioned\nthe only way to preserve that or fight\nthat loss of Aging is to strength train\nso people will tend to hear numbers like\nyou lose about one percent of muscle\nsize per year after age about 40. and\nthat's true however what they don't\nrealize is you lose about two to four\npercent of your strength\nper year so the loss of strength is\nalmost double that\nthe loss of muscle mass with aging\nmuscle power is more like eight to ten\npercent per year\nand so we can very clearly see the\nproblem you're going to have with aging\nis not going to be preservation of\nmuscle although that is incredibly\nimportant it's going to be very\nspecifically preservation of muscle\npower and strength and why that really\nmatters is your ability to again stand\nup and move your ability to catch\nyourself from a fall your ability to\nfeel confident doing a movement that is\na function of muscle power more than it\nis muscle size and so functionality is\nreally what we want to be right you want\nto be able to do whatever you want to be\ndo physically and feel confident in\ndoing that as you age that's going to\nonly be obtained through strength\ntraining so is it appropriate to say\nthat training for strength and\nhypertrophy is also a way to keep your\nnervous system healthy and young\nabsolutely it is the only exercise route\nwe have for that if you look at just\nbasic numbers like motor units you're\ngoing to see that older individuals have\nlike a 30 to 40 reduction in total motor\nunits So when you say older\napproximately what ages are you\nreferring to because I know many people\nout there such as myself are\n40 and older but I know many of our\nlisteners are in their 20s maybe even in\ntheir teens and I can imagine that\npeople that start doing strength and\nhypertrophy training younger will afford\nthemselves an advantage over time but\nthat everybody should be doing strength\nand hypertrophy training for as much of\ntheir lifespan as possible that's really\nthe message that I'm getting so if\nsomebody is for instance 45 would that\nfall into the bin of older you're going\nto start seeing decrements passed again\naround that age of 40 or so now there's\na lot of genetic variation there and a\nlot of other things go into that\nequation like your sleep and your\nnutrition but that's a fair number to\nsort of think about one actually\nresponses it's actually sort of\ncounterintuitive the wonderful thing\nabout strength training is you don't\nactually have to start at a young age\nuh you can actually in fact I was\nreading a paper this morning because of\nour previous conversation it was an over\nage 90. so these are folks 90 plus and\nthey saw improvements like 30 to 170\npercent in things like muscle size and\nhypertrophy over a very short period of\ntime I think it was 12 weeks so you\ndon't actually have to start there are\nsome adaptations that you're going to\nneed for health that you God you really\nneed to start in your 20s the reason I\nlike to mention that is because if you\nare listening and you are 50 and you're\nlike oh [ __ ] I I haven't been strength\ntraining you're not toast like you\nshould absolutely start now\num but you're going to be able to get to\na fantastic spot\nvery quickly\nsimilarly though if you are 20 or 25 and\n30 and you aren't lifting there are\nstill many reasons why you should do\nthat now and I I'd like to point that\nout because a lot of folks will be like\noh my gosh they said I have to do it\nwhen I'm 20 or 25 or you know I'll be\nsort of screwed and that's not the case\nat all there's really no age limit on\nthis in fact there's actually\ninteresting data that just came out\nshowing this reduction in muscle\nstrength and I perjury that I sort of\ntalked about is basically ameliorated\nwith a preservation of activity in other\nwords you don't lose these\nfunctionalities because of Aging you\nlose these because of a loss of training\nto state that again you don't lose these\nbecause of some innate physiological\nthing that happens with genes become\nless sensitive or you lose functionality\nyou pretty much can describe the loss of\nfunction of strength and muscle and\naging as exclusively because of a loss\nof training and nutrition and anabolic\nresistance and some other things so\nyou can do a lot more than you think\nwhen it comes to maintaining high\nquality muscle and that's really\nimportant to point out I'm reminded of\nthe words of the great sharington he won\nthe Nobel Prize he's a physiologist I\nguess the neuroscientists try and claim\nhim as a neuroscientist because he\nworked on the nervous system the\nphysiologists claim as a as a\nphysiologist he is 100 a physiologist I\nwould call him a neuroscientist maybe we\ncan argue about this later\num we will but I think one of the key\nthings that sharington pointed out was\nthat I believe the quote was that\nmovement is the final common path and\nwhat he was referring to was the fact\nthat a significant fraction of the brain\nitself is devoted to our ability to move\nand our ability to engage in resistance\ntype movements and that resistance type\nmovements and the continuation of\nmovement throughout the lifespan\nis what keeps the brain young and\nhealthy and vital and there are so much\ndata now to support that but I'm so\ngrateful that you brought up early this\nfact that there's a neuromuscular link\nbecause I think a lot of people think\nabout musculoskeletal they forget that\nthe nervous system is really in charge\nof the um strength of the muscle\ncontractions and the types of muscle\ncontractions that occur I'm certain\nwe're going to get into that in a lot of\ndepth today you're close there we're not\ntotally right but we're close Okay well\nI look forward to being corrected\num and to achieving the Precision that\nyou're known for uh around that\ndiscussion so if we are to step back and\nsay strength training and hypertrophy\ntraining is critical for people of all\nages yeah\nfor developing and maintaining the\nneuromuscular system and for\nour ability to function in the world\nyeah\nnot just offset injury but the ability\nto pick things up and move Etc\nwhat are some of the other things that\nstrengthen hypertrophy training can\nprovide I know a lot of people use\nstrength and hypertrophy training for\nchanging their Aesthetics what is your\nsense about its potency for changing\nAesthetics as compared to say\ncardiovascular exercise yeah the the\nMantra I always like is the reason you\nwant to exercise is threefold right you\nwant to look good feel good play good\nthat that's really that comes from sport\ncomes from football specifically we\nalways say that and what that means\nreally is you want to look good people\nwant to look the way they want to look\nwhatever that means to them and there\nare any versions of what you feel to be\naesthetically pleasing and that's\ntotally irrelevant but people want to\nlook the way they want to look number\ntwo you want to be able to feel good\nwhat's that mean you want to be injury\nfree you want to have energy throughout\nthe day you want to be able to execute\nanything you want to so whether you want\nto go surf in the morning you want to\nplay racquetball you want to hike or you\nwant to do all three of those in one day\nyou should have the ability to do that\nand then you want to play good which\nmeans you should be able to execute any\nagain activities that you want to\nexecute whatever that means all right so\nbacking all up what's that got to do\nwith your question\num one of the major benefits of strength\ntraining is the responses tend to happen\nextremely fast so you can see noticeable\nchanges in muscle size certainly within\na month absolutely within six weeks and\nso we have this wonderful feedback loop\nthat sort of tells you am I doing the\nsame correctly\noh my gosh yes I am also it's very\naddicting the feedback the response the\nphysical changes whether this is\nactually point two or three look good or\nfeel good play good or it's even just\npart one you're starting to see that\nwhen you compare that to things like fat\nloss that Journey tends to be longer\nit's more difficult it's more Reliant\nupon other factors like nutrition\nEtc strength training is really about\nlike there's some very minimal nutrition\nrequirements outside of that it comes\ndown to the training and the feedback is\nimmediate that's powerful because if you\nlook across the literature on exercise\nadherence you'll see that that is in\nfact the number one predictor of\neffectiveness of any training program\nso what that means is if you were to put\nany variable possible and figure out\nwhat is going to determine\nwhether or not this program works this\nis what we typically call the methods or\nmany in the concepts are few so the\nmethods of exercise the methods of\nstrength training the mess of the\nmethods of hypertrophy training which\nwe'll talk about are are infinite\nhowever there are only a handful of key\nConcepts that you have to achieve in\norder for that program to work adherence\nis one of them and again is often the\ntop one so you need to do something you\nneed to do something consistently\nwhen you are getting that feedback and\nyou're seeing results in your appearance\nimmediately and you see that every\nsingle day every time you take off your\nshirt or every time you look in the\nmirror you see that result that tends to\ndrive adherence\num really powerfully so it's important\nto give people wins especially people\nwho are not maybe like you and I who are\nlike I'm gonna lift weights and I'm\ngonna exercise like no matter what the\nrest of my life because I just love it\nnot everyone's like that and so giving\nthem a little bit of carrot of success\nand if you can achieve that in you know\nsay three to four to five weeks already\nit's very powerful tool before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is also\nseparate from Dr galpin's teaching and\nresearch roles at Cal State Fullerton it\nis however part of our desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme we'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is momentous momentous\nmakes supplements of the absolute\nhighest quality the huberman Lab podcast\nis proud to be partnering with momentous\nfor several important reasons first of\nall as I mentioned their supplements are\nof extremely high quality second of all\ntheir supplements are generally in\nsingle ingredient formulations if you're\ngoing to develop a supplementation\nprotocol you're going to want to focus\nmainly on using single ingredient\nformulations with single ingredient\nformulations you can devise the most\nlogical and effective and cost-effective\nsupplementation regimen for your goals\nin addition momentous supplement ship\ninternationally and this is of course\nimportant because we realize that many\nof the huberman Lab podcast listeners\nreside outside the United States if\nyou'd like to try the various\nsupplements mentioned on the huberman\nLab podcast in particular supplements\nfor Hormone Health for Sleep\noptimization for Focus as well as a\nnumber of other things including\nexercise recovery you can go to live\nmomentous spelled ous so

an\neight-sleep mattress cover for about the\nlast eight months and it has completely\ntrans formed my sleep I'm sleeping about\nthe same amount but I'm sleeping far\ndeeper and I'm now getting the proper\nratios of so-called rapid eye movement\nor REM sleep and slow wave sleep and\nwaking up feeling far more recovered\nmentally and physically the underlying\nmechanism for all that is very\nstraightforward I've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast and elsewhere\nabout the critical relationship between\nsleep and body temperature that is in\norder to fall asleep at night your body\nneeds to drop by about one to three\ndegrees in terms of core body\ntemperature and waking up involves a one\nto three degree increase in core body\ntemperature with eight Sleep mattress\ncovers you can adjust the temperature of\nyour sleeping environment to be one\ntemperature at the start of the night a\ndifferent temperature the middle of the\nnight and a different temperature as you\napproach morning Each of which can place\nyou into the optimal stages of sleep and\nhave you waking up feeling more\nrefreshed than ever if you'd like to try\nAid sleep you can go to

you\nreal-time feedback on your blood glucose\nusing a continuous glucose monitor many\npeople are aware that their blood sugar\nthat is their blood glucose level is\ncritical for everything from Fat Loss to\nmuscle gain to healthy cognition and\nindeed aging of the brain and body most\npeople do not know however how different\nfoods and different activities including\nexercise or different temperature\nenvironments impact their blood glucose\nlevels and yet blood glucose is\nexquisitely sensitive to all of those\nthings I first started using levels\nabout a year ago as a way to understand\nhow different foods exercise and timing\nof food relative to exercise and quality\nof sleep at night impact my blood\nglucose levels and I've learned a\ntremendous amount from using levels it's\ntaught me when best to eat what best to\neat when best to exercise how best to\nexercise and how to modulate my entire\nschedule from work to exercise and even\nmy sleep so if you're interested in\nlearning more about levels and trying a\ncontinuous glucose monitor yourself go\nto levels.link huberman that's\nlevels.link huberman let's talk about\nstrength and hypertrophy\nif you would please remind us what\nstrength and hypertrophy are in terms of\nthe specific adaptation they represent\nwhat I mean by that is when somebody is\ntraining for strength what are they\nreally training for obviously it means\nthe ability to move more weight but I\nknow that it includes a number of other\nthings as well and when one is training\nfor hypertrophy for the growth of muscle\nfibers\nwhat does that represent because I think\nif people understand that they will far\nbetter understand the methods and\nprotocols that are going to be best for\nstrength and hypertrophy at its core\nyou've basically described it when we\ntalk about strength we're talking about\nan actual function so can you create\nmore Force across a muscle or muscle\ngroups or our total movement and when we\ntalk about hypertrophy now we're\nspecifically referring to just an\nincrease in size there's no actual\nmention of function so a muscle can grow\nlarger without actually technically\nbeing stronger for a number of reasons\nhowever there is a strong relationship\nbetween strength and hypertrophy so a\nlot of the times in the general public\nin the lay conversations we sort of lump\nthose two things in it's the same thing\nand so we have to recognize people who\nare new to training or people even are\nintermediately trained there is a huge\noverlap between strength and our perjury\nonce you get past that though they\nbecome disentangled and a good example\nof it is this if you look at the\nstrongest people in the world this would\nbe people who compete in the sport of\npower lifting\nright that's a true test of maximal\nstrength so it is a deadlift a bench\npress and a back squat and you're going\nto do a one repetition Max in all three\nof those and so whoever wins is the\nperson who lifted the most amount of\nweight one time that's it it's not like\nWorld's Strongest Man where it is how\nmany reps can you do in a row or your\ntime right is a true maximal strength\ntest and you compare those to say\nbodybuilders now both of those\nindividuals are strong and both of those\nindividuals have a lot of muscle however\nit is extremely clear the power lifters\nwill be significantly stronger\nthan the bodybuilders on average right\nthere are individual exceptions but\nwe're just talking Collective averages\nand the bodybuilders will have more\nmuscle than the other ones in addition\nwhether you look at Olympic\nweightlifting or power lifting or\nworld's strongest man for that matter\nthere are weight classes and the reason\nis as you go up in weight classes you\nwill always see the world records go\nhigher and higher and higher right so\nyou can clearly get stronger without\nadding any muscle however there's a\npoint right where you simply have to add\nmore mass to get a higher number and\nthat's why we have weight classes in\nthose Sports and in Combat Sports and\nlots of other things so\nwe have there's a lot of confusion right\nbecause people think man either these\nare the same thing or if I want to get\nstronger I have to get bigger which is\nnot the case at all another misnomer\nhere is I can't get stronger\nunless I add muscle that's not true\neither right it's a similar idea\nso what I'm saying is you have the\nability to do whatever you'd like if\nyou'd like to get stronger and add\nmuscle\ngreat if you add muscle you're probably\ngoing to bring some strength along for\nthe ride\nhowever if you want to get stronger and\nyou don't want to add muscle for any\nreason personal preference on Aesthetics\nwhether you're in a weight class and you\nsimply can't afford it it is quite easy\nto get stronger and not add much muscle\nmass either and so differentiating these\ntwo things is one of them is simply a\nmeasure of size and the other one is a\nmeasure of force and when we talk about\nstrength what we're really talking about\nare two unique components component one\nis what I call the physiology so what it\nwhat is the ability of the neuromuscular\nsystem what is the ability of the muscle\nfibers to contract and produce Force the\nother one is what we call mechanics and\nmechanics is simply things like it's\nminutia down to how long your femurs are\nrelative to your tibia or or other\nthings like this is biomechanics this is\nalso technique this is skill this is how\nsmooth you feel this is are you firing\nthe right muscle group in the right\nsequence and Order and all of these\nthings play into strength so somebody\nwho maybe has more Force capability in\ntheir muscle fibers but their technique\nin the movement is worse may lose in a\ncompetition or somebody again who's\num like if you go into the world of\nspeed and power especially you'll hear a\nlot of people talk about like the Rhythm\nand there's just a certain Rhythm that\nhas to happen if you want to jump as\nhigh as possible or run as fast as fast\nas possible but that's all mechanics at\nthis fundamental level so when we look\nat hypertrophy\nit's just still simply about how big the\nmuscle is\nso those are the really the the\nsimilarities and distinctions between\nstrength and hypertrophy when strength\nimproves\nand when hypertrophy increases\nis there also involvement in the\nligaments and tendons that is of course\nthe ligaments and tendons are involved\nin the movements and yeah but do\nligaments and tendons themselves grow\nand or get stronger\nthis field is really difficult because\nconnective tissue is not vascular and so\ntheir plasticity is significantly lower\nthan skeletal muscle in fact if you look\nacross all the organs a skeletal muscle\nis one of if not the most plastic\nmeaning it's the most pliable the most\nresponsive the one that's going to\nadjust it's basically it's paying\nattention to everything that's being\nsaid in the body you cannot change blood\npressure or pH or\nmacronutrients floating around without\nmuscle knowing about it it is in fact\nthis is why we call muscle an organ\npeople don't tend to think about this if\nyou were ever on like Jeopardy and they\nask you that question like what's the\nbiggest organ system in the body people\ntend to say the skin muscle is actually\nthe correct answer all right well I'm\ngoing to cite you when I get it yeah\nJeopardy I don't have any immediate\nplans to go on Jeopardy but who knows oh\nthere you go Celebrity Jeopardy Angie\nhuberman wait I don't know about the\ncelebrity part but uh Jeopardy would be\nfun yeah um but I will say the muscle\nand I'll I'll if you get a phone call in\nJeopardy I don't know I haven't seen\nthat show in a very long time yeah uh\nmaybe ever then I'll I'll call you but\nthat makes sense\num so that muscles would be the largest\norgan system in the body the reason I\nwas saying that is so muscle is both\nlistening and talking it is controlling\nuh the immune system a lot it's\ncontrolling blood glucose regulation it\nis it is the central Depot for uh amino\nacids which are needed to do things like\nregulate the immune system build any new\nred blood cells a lot of this stuff is\ncoming from skeletal muscle so when we\nsay organ by the way that's actually\nlike a physiological definition so\nsomething that's communicating uh to\neither another organ itself or uh\nthroughout the system so it's listening\nand it's talking connective tissue is\nnot the same way and so we do see\nadaptations with strength training in\nconnective tissue\nit's just much lower it's difficult to\nmeasure effectively what we know now is\nyou're going to have a combination of\nadaptations throughout the connective\ntissue it is beneficial this is probably\none of the major reasons that's that\nstrength training reduces injury risk\nwhich is very very important because\npeople who tend to want to pick up an\nexercise routine after say 10 years the\nclassic cliche is like I played all\nthese things in high school then I went\nto college got a job now I'm 25 or 35 or\nwhatever and you sort of want to jump\nback into what you did when you were 20.\nwell there's no tissue tolerance left\nand what we almost always mean by that\nis connective tissue the tolerance in\nthere is not ready for the load you're\nabout to handle and so you go through\nsome movement and then boom sprains\ntears\num you know even like the more\nsignificant ones are on Achilles tear\nwhich is going to really sideline you so\nthose are some of the problems and we\nknow strength training as a large role\nin injury reduction for stress and\nstrain and overuse injuries and that's\nspecifically coming from the connective\ntissue adaptations again the difficult\npart here is\nit's very hard to assess we actually\num when I was a doctoral student we\nplayed around with patella tendon\nbiopsies so I actually had one this is\nlike a there's a little piece of your\npatella tendon missing yeah because your\nown yeah own lab so now I've probably\nhad\nI don't know how many hundreds of\nbiopsies I've performed on people\num probably well over a thousand\ncertainly well over a thousand I've\nprobably had 35 or 40 done in myself\nthere's no problem here I have no Scar\nTissue I have no loss of function and\nI've stuck needles in every leg like all\nover myself right quads uh my Soleus\ngastroc like all up taking tissue out\nyeah you want the needle looks like a\npen basically and you you know you're\nalive and you go in and grab a chunk and\nyou pull it out and can I come to your\nlab and get biopsy absolutely yeah\nyou're probably looking under the\nmicroscope it'll just look like the\nmolecule caffeine there's a there's a\nmutual friend of ours who came down and\ndid that he's a big big big gentleman\nbig into lifting very into strength\ntraining uh and he he went through that\nexperience and he was like oh my gosh it\nwas not what he was hoping to get he\nactually had\nunbelievable muscle morphology his\nfibers were the diameter of muscle\nfibers is extremely large it's one of\nthe biggest cells by volume in all the\nbiology skeletal muscle and human and\nhow large I can't help myself\num millimeters\nwell you so you have length right and\nthen you have width right so lengthwise\nit can be extraordinarily long you can\nbe the classic example is like your\nSartorius which is like the front of\nyour hip to the inside of your kneecap\ntheoretically those cells can run the\nentire length which would be one muscle\nfiber running that thing if I were to do\na biopsy on you and I and I pulled that\ntissue out I could actually pull an\nindividual fiber out with tweezers and\nhold it up and you could see that whole\nmuscle cell yeah I'm definitely not\ngoing to get biopsy um you'd be stunned\nhow big they are anyways his was the\nsize of a rhino so the diameter of his\nnow he has a well-documented assistance\nin the area of muscle growth we'll say\num but yeah those can be large so what\nwere we even talking about there well I\nwas asking about tendons and ligaments\num because I'd like to understand the\nvarious tissues and organ systems that\nadapt when one gets stronger when muscle\ntissue grows and I I do want to ask\nabout bone yeah um and here I'm not\nreferring to Bone mineral density what I\nwas going to ask is whether or not\nbone itself can grow and get stronger\nand the reason I'm asking is there's a\nfavorite result of mine I have about\n3 800 favorite results 3 000 pet peeves\nand 3 800 plus favorite results\num but one of my favorite results is\nfrom Eric kindel's Lab at Columbia Eric\nwon the Nobel Prize for learning and\nmemory and his laboratory got really\ninto the effects of exercise on learning\nand memory yeah and they had this\nincredible result\nwhich is that\nload-bearing exercise yeah stimulates\nthe bones to release something called\nosteocalcin excuse me and then\nosteocalcin acts as a more or less a\nhormone travels to the brain and\nenhances the memory systems in the brain\nby enhancing neuron Health that's the\nbasic Crux of of the studies there were\nseveral of these and\nThe Moment I Saw the first of those\nstudies I thought well here's another\nreason to do resistance type exercise\nand not just aerobic exercise and then\nit brings to mind whether or not bones\nthemselves get stronger when we do\nresistance training I don't know the\nanswer to that yeah that's very clearly\ndemonstrated and we've known that for\nfor many decades\num you have a\na diminishing ability to do so with age\nparticularly you need to do this in your\nteens and 20s this is where you're going\nto have the largest ability to enhance\nbone mineral density and it's\nparticularly responsive to axial loading\nnow I'm a muscle guy I'm not a bone\nspecialist so we would have to consult\nsomebody who can give you more position\nhere but that's you explain axial\nloading it's up and down it's vertical\nokay so it's almost like a like a\ncylinder putting the weight of the on\nthe small end of the cylinder on both\nsmall end of the cylinders yeah if\nsomeone doesn't do this in their 20s or\nteens however\ncan we assume that some degree of\npositive change will occur if they do\nresistance training even if it's a small\nfraction the answer is yes it is small\nwe have worked with a number of women in\nour\num our rapid health program that come in\nand they are in their 20s and they're in\ntheir 30s and they have significant bone\nmarrow density problems and eight months\nlater we can see noticeable changes that\nare outside of the measurement error of\na positive change positive changes\ncorrect and if you worked with the there\nare many Physicians that specialize in\nthis area you you're going to need a\nNutri nutrition here strengthening alone\nis probably not going to get you there\nparticularly with women because you have\nto figure out why and and there's a lot\ngoing on with the physiology and\nbiochemistry so you probably like almost\nsurely needed to have some blood\nchemistry done with that you have to\nfigure out what's going on menstrual\ncycle wise in fact like oftentimes what\nwe'll do\nfor our women very specifically is we\nuse a thing called The Rhythm plus a\n30-day test so you can actually do a\nsalivary test across the entire\nmenstrual cycle and you can take uh\nsamples it's about every other day so\nyou get 15 or 16 samples and you get a\nreally beautiful picture of what's\nHappening hormonally across the entire\nmenstrual cycle and that's really really\nimportant because typically for women if\nyou get a single sample or simple time\nPoint whether it's salivary urine or\nblood you can have\num well like a order of magnitude\ndifference in any number of metrics\nbecause of what phase are in this is one\nof the many reasons why it's been such a\nchallenge to do a lot of physiology\nresearch with females some metrics\nchange throughout the menstrual cycle\nothers don't like strength is a very\ngood example I can strengthen and I can\ndo a one rep max test on a woman at any\npoint I don't have to do that at a\ncertain phase of their menstrual cycle\nbecause it's the evidence I think is\npretty clear at this point that number\nwon't change so I have no qualms\nincluding female files in any of my\nstudies where strength is an absolute is\nan important dependent variable because\nI don't have to adjust around menstrual\ncycle other factors like anything in in\nblood anything hormone related you're\ngoing to have to automatically account\nfor it so what I would say is those\nfolks should absolutely work with a\nqualified physician and you you're going\nto have to get some nutrition\nsupplementation potentially and then\nmaybe even some other stuff going on to\nmake that even more complicated\nif you're on any form of birth control\nor not that's going to change the entire\nequation especially if it's a\nhormone-based birth control so it just\ngets really really complicated to answer\nit though you can see adaptations they\nare significantly diminished relative to\nif you would have started in your teens\nand 20s but there is hope you just need\nto work with somebody who specializes in\nthat area\nso for both men and women boys and girls\nwhat are the major adaptations that\noccur to underlie improvements in\nstrength and if you would if you could\njust provide a bullet point list of that\nand then we can dive into each of those\nin detail\nfor instance\nare nerves getting more efficient at\nfiring our bones enjoying adaptations in\ndifferent yeah bone connective tissue\nrelationships that that underlie\nstrength I have to imagine all these\nthings are happening but what are the\nthe major changes that are occurring in\nthose Origins and organ systems that\nreflect someone's ability to on one day\nlift you know 100 pounds and then a week\nlater to lift uh 105 pounds now I'll try\nto keep this condensed again this could\nbe an entire University course\nI will also try to give you a little bit\nof Bones here so normally as a muscle\nguy I only I take all the credit and\nmuscle\nturns out the nervous system gets a\nlittle bit of credit too here thank you\nso as we walk through it just in as a\nbig picture if we think about again what\ncauses human movement basically\neverything along that chain will improve\nthe strength training and I'm not really\nbeing using too much hyperbole there\nit's quite impressive so it's going from\nthe nervous system side of the equation\nwhat has to happen for human movement is\na nerve has to send a signal through a\nmotor unit now a motor unit is comes\ndown and interface multiple muscle\nfibers so if you think about your actual\nmuscle it's not a thing it is a\ncomponent of many individual muscle\nfibers so you've got millions if not\nmore think of it like a ponytail so we\ncollectively say ponytail and you think\nof it as like one thing but really a\nponytail is a combination of tons of\nindividual hairs okay muscles the same\nway so this motor unit comes in and\ninnervates a lot of different muscle\nfibers now every one of the fibers in a\nmotor unit is generally of the same\nfiber type so fast switch or slow twitch\nand they are not laid out next to each\nother in the muscle they are spread out\nacross horizontally vertically as well\nas closer to the Bone and further to the\nsurface so they're moved throughout the\nentire way and this is what allows you\nto have smoother contractions and you\ndon't have spasticity and things like\nthat so we see improvements from the\nneuromuscular side like firing rate we\nsee synchronization improvements um that\nare coming in you also see improvements\nin things like acetylcholine release\nfrom the presynaptic neuron so you're\ngetting it faster we see calcium\nrecycling is improved back uh to there\nso in order for without walking into too\nmuch of the biochemistry in order for a\nsignal to go from nerve to muscle\nthere's a little bit of a gap there's a\nphysical space that happens and what\nhappens is you release this molecule\ncalled acetylcholine this goes into the\npostsynaptic left and then that actually\nbinds to a receptor that receptor\nactually opens up a door that lets\nsodium in that's really what's happening\nso it's not the acetylcholine without\nacetylcholine then sits on that receptor\nsite it's broken down put back in and\nrecycled back up in the presynaptic\nnerve site the faster you can do that\nthe faster you can recycle that signal\nand so almost everything that I describe\nin that entire system improves and has\nbeen shown to to increase with training\nso that alone is given to give you\nbenefits we haven't even walked into to\ngetting from an electrical signal now\ninto an action potential which is going\nto cause a muscle contraction\nso getting from nerve into the muscle we\nsee everything from improvements when we\ncall contractility which means the\nmuscle fiber themselves can produce more\nforce or more velocity independent of\nmuscle size changes this is another\ncomponent when we ask like well how is\nit I got stronger\nwithout getting bigger well in the\nmuscle fiber itself its ability to\ncontract Force increases and this is\nbecause we have everything like the\nsarcoplasmic reticulum which is the\nplace that stores and releases the\ncalcium which is what's needed for this\nentire cross-bridge interaction from the\nmyosin and actin to happen I know a lot\nI just lost a lot of people but you can\ngo look at some of these images the\nsarcoplasmatricium gets gets activated\nmore it gets more sensitive it is better\nat releasing calcium bringing it back in\nand doing it again the bond between the\ncrossbridge the myosin actin gets\nstronger the calcium Affinity is the\nphrase that we use there increases so\nwe're literally walking through almost\nthe entire process of skeletal muscle\ncontraction here and every step along\nthe way we we see improvements so that\nnet result is we see again more Force\nproduction independent of any change in\nsize independent of any increase in\ncontractile units we didn't add anything\nto the equation we didn't change size we\ndid nothing but improve efficiency\neffectively independent of that now we\ncan actually start talking about\nchanging muscle fiber type so we can\nchange our fibers from a slow twitch\nfiber to a fast twitch fiber that alone\nis going to give you more forced\nproduction again independent of size\nfast switch fibers 10 to be larger than\nSoul touch fibers but not always\nespecially in the presence of endurance\ntraining so if you do a lot of\nconsistent endurance training it's very\ncommon for us to find slow touch fibers\nthat are as similar size if not larger\noften very often larger than those fast\ntouch fibers if you take slow fibers big\nslow very metabolically effective\nvibrous so extremely fatigue resistant\nso it's not a bad thing to call them\nslow is like we tend to say fastest low\nand slow has this negative connotation\nbut it's like quite healthy like fiber\ntype to have outside of that now we\nhaven't even gotten into things like\npenation angle so this is an angle at\nwhich your muscle fibers interact with\nyour bone so we tend to think about this\nas like a muscle fiber is pulling on a\nmuscle well some some of these are\noriented are almost a 90 degree so a\nfiber runs perpendicular into the bone\nand some of them are closer to like a 45\ndegree and some of them are closer to\nalmost parallel and that confers a lot\nof unique mechanical benefits so in one\narea it's actually going to increase\nForce production you go the other\ndirection increases velocity and so we\nhave all kinds of changes in the angle\nat which the muscle inserts into the\nbone now we're already on the mechanic\nside of it right so we've we've\ninfluenced how effectively it pulls and\nwith any of these things it's always a\ngive and take so you're going to give up\nin the case of a Nation angle you're\ngoing to give up strength but you're\ngoing to increase of a lot shortening\nvelocity or if you want to increase the\nvelocity you're going to give up sort of\nthe strength right we haven't gotten to\nany of the energetics at all so we\nhaven't talked about increasing storage\nof phosphocreatine which is the energy\nsystem needed to power that muscle\ncontraction at the fastest possible rate\nso we can continue to go as long as you\nwant here but hopefully you're getting\nthe point of a little bit of the\nadaptations that occur the reason I want\nto actually why I think that stuff is\nimportant to bring it back maybe for\nsome Muslims I know I took you on a\njourney there and you're just like what\nthe hell just happened\nthat matters because again this is the\nspecific explanation for how is it\npossible that I got stronger but I\ndidn't get bigger and this is also why\nstrength and hypertrophy are intertwined\nand heavily overlapped but are not\nnecessarily the same thing so for\nexample we can increase muscle size\nand actually reduce strength because of\nwhat's called lattice spacing so what\nhappens is you have to kind of remember\nyour muscle fibers are these long\ncylinders and the way that they contract\nrequires an optimal space and so what\nhappens is you have this molecule called\nactin and you have this molecule called\nmyosin myosin sits in the middle and\nthere are six actin that surround each\nindividual myosin in a three-dimensional\nCircle here so you got a myosin in the\nmiddle that has all these globular heads\nand they can reach up and grab man\nacting and again there's six sort of\naround them right\num well one of the things that can occur\nis if those those actin are too close\ntogether so I imagine my hands\num I'm reaching out and doing a giant T\nright so I'm horizontal out there well\nif my fingertips are the tips of the\nmyosin and I'm trying to reach up and\ngrab an actin and I want to pull those\nactins closer to my face well those act\nand stack on top of each other and\nthat's what actually makes your muscles\ngrow up like if I flex my bicep it\nactually you know grows up three or four\ninches\nbecause you're stacking these these\nsarcomeres or what they're called on top\nof each other all right great well if\nI'm reaching out to grab them and the\nmuscle is stretched too far I can't\nactually make that strong of a\nconnection it would be like if I reached\nout and grabbed something but I can only\nreach my longest fingertip on it when I\ngo to contract I can't make that strong\nof a contraction because my grip is weak\nmy grip's gonna break before I reach my\nstrength limit if I'm too close there's\nnowhere to go I'm already as close so if\nyou actually disrupt that lattice\nspacing too much you can actually lose a\nlittle bit of strength so it's not that\ngetting bigger will ever make you weaker\nit's simply that you're not optimizing\nfor strength You're simply optimizing\nfor size and so that can that can\nexplain a little bit of the of the\ndisconcurity between growing and\nperformance\nI'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor athletic

of the\nmajor changes that occur in muscle nerve\nEtc when\nwe experience hypertrophy\nI've heard of protein synthesis changes\nI'm assuming that's true maybe you can\ntell us a bit more about that\nchanges in blood flow yep\nperhaps changes in neural innervation\nwho knows maybe even changes in fascia\nI'm not aware of any specifically but um\nI have to imagine that they're somehow\ninvolved sure so the when we talk about\nhypertrophy a lot of the adaptations are\ngoing to be similar because the the mode\nof training is close enough so your\nnerves probably aren't smart enough to\ndifferentiate between a set of five reps\nor a set of eight repetitions they're\nsmart enough to differentiate anything\nlike they know everything that's going\non but it's going to be a huge overlap\nthe primary difference with hypertrophy\nis a couple of things so if you think\nabout the muscle microstructure\num I have a whole series of videos on\nYouTube if you want to see the visuals\nbehind this in fact in there I include\nthe specific diameter size of muscle\nfibers that I've failed to give you a\nfew minutes ago we will provide an\nactive link to this right so\num what happens is this when we talk\nabout and you hear that this classic\nBuzz phrase of muscle protein synthesis\ngenerally what we're talking about there\nis is contractile units and so when we\nsay contractile units we're talking\nabout the myosin and actin and so what\nwe're really trying to do\nis say okay there's some amount of\nprotein turnover where we're coming in\nand we're trying to add more proteins to\nthe equation and so what has to happen\nthere is a series of steps so step\nnumber one is there has to be some sort\nof signal from the external World um\nthis could actually oftentimes it's\nthings like stretching of the cell wall\nwhich is what happens with exercise\nright so you're Contracting a short and\nyou get this big stretch of the cell\nwall it can come from a simple things\nlike an amino acid infusion this is just\neating protein this is why protein\ningestion alone is anabolic right it'll\nhelp you grow muscle independent of even\nmoving so just eating\nprotein will grow your muscles yeah\ncertainly and those that those data are\nvery clear\num of course like anything there's a\nsaturation point\nin terms of total amount you need to get\nto and and things like that but yeah if\nyou were to walk into a laboratory\nfasted overnight and I gave you 30 grams\nof protein we would see a very\nmeasurable increase in protein synthesis\nquite clearly for several hours probably\nfour to five plus hours um we could\nmaybe bring us to people that would know\nthose data better but many hours with no\nwaitroon correct I am betting that most\npeople are not aware of that fact you\nknow what's actually interesting about\nit is if you do the exact same study\nagain and you just did strength training\nyou would also see an improvement in\nprotein synthesis right but those\nfactors are independent and the\nmechanisms are independent such that if\nyou do them both together they stack on\ntop of each other\nwhich is really wonderful and if you\nwere to add carbohydrate into that mix\nnow you're actually adding fuel for the\nentire muscle protein synthesis process\nand now you're going to see even\nadditive benefits and this is why for so\nmany years uh this is what bore the\nwhole like post exercise anabolic window\nthing which is like you got to get carbs\nand protein in post exercise to maximize\num mostly perjury now that turned out to\nbe like not totally true in terms of the\nWindows window to not be as strict as\npeople initially uh asserted as I recall\nbut but still I think that's super\ninteresting these are parallel Pathways\nfor for protein synthesis simply eating\nprotein\num or training each independently\nincreases protein synthesis uh I can't\nhelp but ask is the same true if one\ndoesn't endurance type exercise if I go\nout for a 45 minute jog where I can\nnasal breathe the whole time but if I\nwere to go any faster I would have to\nkick over into mouth breathing as well\nso-called Zone 2 ish cardio will I see\nan increase in protein in synthesis as\nsimply as a consequence of that jog now\nthis is one of the unique factors of\nstrength training you're not going to\nsay that in fact you would it's\ndifficult to measure protein breakdown\nthat's been as extraordinarily\nchallenging to do in the laboratory but\nyou're not going to see those benefits\nin fact you're going to see quite the\nopposite it's an entire molecular\nCascade\nso this is kind of how it works so you\nhave to have some sort of signal on the\noutside and this can be an energetic\nsignal so this could be glucose uptake\nit could be protein intake it could be a\nphysical stretch what happens is on the\ncell wall there is some sort of it could\nbe testosterone right testosterone could\nbind to beta adrenergic receptors and\nthis activates a whole series of\nCascades of signaling proteins and these\nproteins basically play a game of\ntelephone so one tells the next one this\nis the next one and I sort of walk this\nentire way well that molecular Cascade\nis fundamentally the same thing with\nregardless of the insult but they're\ndifferent Pathways and so\nthe pathway from strength training or\nprotein ingestion is going to go to the\nsame nucleus it's going to activate a\nwhole set of Gene Cascades that are\ngoing to tell you to to go through this\nentire process of protein synthesis\nwhich I'll walk through what that is in\na second if you do endurance training\nit's a different pathway and so instead\nof activating this entire thing of like\nmtor and akt and this is anabolic\nsignaling Cascade it's going to do a\ndifferent one which you can think of\nmore of like as ampk an energy signaling\nthing so there's a crossover Point here\nin fact one of the things you'll notice\nis mtor and akt don't really influence\nampk but there is some literature that\nyears ago showed ampk will activate\nanother protein called tsc2 and that\nwill actually inhibit mtor and that was\nthe first molecular explanation for the\nquote-unquote interference effect of\nendurance training on hypertrophy could\nyou just take a highlight for people\nwhat this is because as you describe\nthese signaling Pathways I just want to\num maybe just put a top Contour\nexplanation the mtor pathway is\nsynonymous with cell growth yeah both\nduring development as organisms humans\nincluded mature and cells get larger\nmtor's abundant in the system to put it\nquite simply and then the ampk pathway\nand some of the metabolic signaling that\nyou're referring to is more synonymous\nwith cardiovascular exercise in this at\nleast in the context of this discussion\nand fuel utilization yep and what you\ndescribed as a crossover point where\ncertain forms of exercise can tap into\nboth of these yep but\nat least for sake of this conversation\nwe're largely separating them yeah\nbecause the the byproduct is the thing\nthat uh that matters here so the result\nof uh mtor and akt getting into the\nnucleus is going to be increased in\nprotein synthesis the result of ampk\nrunning down to the mind is going to be\nresult in increasing mitochondrial\nbiogenesis so the net outcome is\ndifferent now\nI do want to flag it very quickly\nthis is an extraordinarily complicated\nthing and um in fact in our laboratory\nwe were able to to be one of the first\nthat figured out how to measure all the\ndifferent subunits of ampk and\nindividual muscles by fiber type so\nbecause you're ripping people's muscles\nout of their knees and their patellar\ntendons uh so anxious teasing they're\nthey're gently removing with under IRB\nprotocol of course\num so even when we say something like\nampk it's not one thing Amy we say\nthings like mtor it's not one thing\neither it is you have the total amount\nthat matters you have the activation the\nactivation sites or many of them so it's\nnot a simple\num as what I'm laying it on I just wanna\na big concept of kind of what's\nHappening Here to actually kind of\nanswer your question\nwhich is okay so how is the muscle\nactually growing what you have to\nunderstand is is a little bit of how\num protein synthesis occurs so what I'm\ngenerally meaning is you have a whole\nbunch of amino acids and this actually\ngoes back to maybe like middle school\nbiology class right so if you take a\nbunch of amino acids and you combine\nthem together we get these things called\na peptide right and if anyone who's ever\nheard of like peptides that's all it\nreally means you put a bunch of those\ntogether you have a poly peptide you put\na bunch of those together and we now\nhave a protein so any protein I want to\nmake is going to go through the exact\nsame system the exact same steps it\ndoesn't matter if that protein is going\nto be a red blood cell it doesn't matter\nif that's going to be a hair follicle\ndoesn't matter if it's going to be\nskeletal muscle that's basically protein\nsynthesis so when we tend to think of\nprotein synthesis we we just paint this\npicture of growing more muscle and\nthat's not the only thing and so when we\ntalk about the benefits of having high\nquality muscle as being this place\nthat's going to regulate most of your\nprotein synthesis we tend to lose some\npeople because they're thinking oh I\ndon't need to gain muscle\nand that's not what we're talking about\nwe're talking about regulating the\nimmune system or regular we're talking\nabout regulating any protein turnover so\nany Protein that's degradated or needs\nto be broken down in your in your system\nat all autophagy this is the end like\nthis is such an important buzzword\num that's just protein breakdown of an\nunneeded or damaged protein right that\nwhole thing is going to go through\nprotein synthesis to be able to come\nback and replace the things the only\nreason you go through autophagy so you\ncan clean that garbage out and then come\nback and build in a more properly\nfunctioning protein so it's not just\nabout growing more muscle mass it's why\nyou want these systems to be operating\nwell\nso the protein ingestion is going to\njust activate that Cascade because it's\nbasically saying oh hey look we have an\nabundance of Supply here why don't we\nmake something out of it because we\ndon't know the next time this thing is\ngoing to be around carbohydrates and fat\nare very easy to store protein is very\nchallenging it's more transient and so\nyou can store some of it and keep it\naround but most of it you're going to\nlose and so when it's available your\nbody wants to act very quickly it\ndoesn't necessarily care if you have\nextra fat floating around in your system\nit's all right let's package it up and\nstore it we can easily bring this back\nout but if you've got protein around\nyou're going to want to use it and so\nthat's why it alone will activate and\nincrease protein synthesis independent\nof exercise so those effects are\nadditive like I said because that\nsignaling process is independent and\nonce you hit a rate limiting phase then\nit you are you're there but at its onset\nthose things will work independently\nokay so that being said what is skeletal\nmuscle hypertrophy in general we think\nabout it as this increase in contractile\nproteins so those myosin and actin\neffectively get thicker okay now what\nhappens is since they are thicker and as\nI talked about a second ago that\ninfluences and actually hurts the\nlattice spacing and so what your body\ndoes as a result is say hey let's\nincrease the diameter of the entire cell\nso that we can maintain our spacing\nbetween these things right it's\neffectively like if you know the two of\nus were sitting in this room and you\ndoubled in size and I was like well\nyou're in my personal space like and I\ndoubled in size now we're in each\nother's space the at some point we just\nhave to make the room larger and that's\nexactly what's happening in the cell and\nso as you can continue to\nincreased muscle size you're going to\nget a muscle myofibular accretion you're\ngoing to continue to increase muscle\nfiber size\nfor years there was this other comment\nabout\nnon-functional hypertrophy\nand this is often called sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy now this is not sarcoplasm\nparticular this is a fancy way of saying\nmy muscle is larger but it has no\nfunction and the question would be why\nthe hell is that possible if I have more\ncontractile units and I can make more of\nthese cross Bridges perform more of\nthese power strokes this is what these\ncontractions are called how could I\npossibly be losing function\nwell\nthat was challenged for that was Bro\nScience for a very very long time in\nfact what it really came down to was are\nthere different types of hypertory\ntraining some that induce contractile\nprotein hypertrophy and some that induce\nthe sarcoplasmic hypertree and that was\nthe significantly challenged until\nrecently\nMike Roberts did at Auburn did a series\nof wonderful studies that showed quite\nclearly that sarcoposmic hypertrophy is\nprobably happening and in fact there's\nprobably a pretty easy explanation in\ngeneral what happens is it is it is a\nincrease in fluid\nin the muscle fiber\nand so this would allow for the diameter\nto be larger but since there's no\naddition of contractile units no more\nforced production happens and so he\nactually has a wonderful review paper I\nbelieve it's open access where you can\ngo look and he created a wonderful graph\num I think that's in my hypertrophy\nvideos on YouTube as well and you can\nactually see that it's likely happening\nin phasic changes throughout your\ntraining experience so at the beginning\nof your training but as as the years and\nyear or weeks rather than months and\nthen eventually years go by in your\ntraining we have a change in the\nhypertrophy that's coming from\ncontractile units versus sarcoplastic so\nI think that is an important note\nbecause\nagain people are wondering like how the\nhell is it even possible for me to get\nlarger muscle and somehow I'm not\nstronger well if it came from Simply\nfluid retention and this is not bloating\nthis is not there's no negative really\nto this it is simply holding a more\nhydration in the cell diameter gets\nlarger and then everything works that\nway\nwhat you just described calls to mind\nsomething similar in the nervous system\nwhich is neuroplasticity which of course\nis the nervous system's ability to\nchange in response to learning and\nexperience and damage for that matter\nyep and we think about it as one term\nbut there are many different forms of\nneuroplasticity a discussion that we\ndon't need to get into now but there's\nSpike timing dependent plasticity and\nltp and long-term depression which has\nnothing to do with psychological\ndepression and on and a pair pulse\nfacilitation and on and on and on in\nshort-term elasticity and so what I'm\nstarting to understand is that there are\nmany paths to what we call strength\nincrease and there are many paths to\nwhat we think of as hypertrophy many of\nthese are going to operate in parallel\nit's going to be rare that any one of\nthem is going to be active alone in\norder to create hypertrophy or strength\nchanges and that certain forms of\nexercise and certain ways of doing\nexercises in terms of sets and\nrepetition schemes and rest intervals\nbetween sets and between training\nsessions are going to tap into different\nmechanisms but also overlapping sets of\nmechanisms which is why if I understand\ncorrectly you mentioned at the beginning\nthat often not always but often strength\nincreases are associated with some\nhypertrophy changes and hypertrophy\nincreases are often not always\nassociated with strength increases do I\nhave that right correct and the beauty\nof this whole thing is while we don't\nyet know the mechanisms specifically and\nthere's a lot of Confusion And there's a\nlot of changes that happen there's uh we\nactually just submitted a paper a few\ndays ago\num my stuff uh Jimmy Bagley at San\nFrancisco and Kevin murick at uh one has\na wonderful muscle physiology Lab at\nArkansas and we we actually this is a\nvery late article actually it's\nincredibly easy to read\num we describe the the role of\nmyonucleation\nin uh muscle my per tree\nand there's actually a lot of energy\nstuff we get into there but\num we're learning more and more about it\nuh as a quick example so\nskeletal muscle is unique in the fact\nthat it is so large in diameter it's\nalso unique in the fact it's\nmultinucleated what that means is\ntypically in biology you see like a cell\nhas one nucleus that's the place that\nhouses and holds the DNA and it's the\ncontrol center that was a degro shrink\ndie repair that whole thing well\nskeletal muscle and human is awesome\nbecause it has thousands if not more\nthere's nuclei which gives it that\nplasticity and so a normal cell has one\nplace it has to go to for any time it\nwants to upregulate down regulate do\nwhatever the thing is your muscle fibers\nhave these little control centers all\nthroughout them and for years we were\nlike okay great\nthe amount of hypertrophy that you can\nexperience is probably limited by the\namount of nuclei you have because you're\nnot going to exceed a certain size of\nmuscle fiber if that's going to mean you\nlose control and so we're like okay\ngreat we found and identified a limiting\nfactor to what will determine how much a\nmuscle can actually grow and then the\nnext question was and then where are\nthese things coming from and this is\nwhere satellite cells come in and so it\nwas very clear a satellite cell that's\nlying dormant sort of on the outside the\nperiphery of the fiber will then go in\num into the into the fibroid will turn\ninto a myonuclei and then it can\nactually you know increase your diameter\nlike that and so then actually it was\nlike hey you're actually limited by the\namount of these satellite cells you can\nget in and turn into nuclear and then\nthe evidence came out that showed hey\nwhat if you D train so what if I used to\nlift weights like a long time ago and I\ngot big but now I've lost a lot of my\nmuscle if I train again you actually get\nthat muscle back faster than it took you\nthe very first time to build it\nlike that's what we call muscle memory\nlike in our film now on your side\nequation muscle memory is something\ndifferent rights and nervous when people\ntalk about muscle memory\num like the ability to ride a bicycle\nafter so many years of not having tried\nto ride one that's actually\nlargely independent of the muscle it has\nsomething to do with exclusively\nIndependence it's basically a nervous\nsystem phenomenon 100 so muscle memory\nuh has been co-opted by different\ncommunities to mean different things\nyeah so on our side muscle memory is\ngoing to mean that ability to remember\nthat muscle size right that hypertrophy\nbecause as you explained the motor\ncontrol thing is that it's a totally a\nnerve thing that's the one I'll give you\nthis one right you guys the nerve people\ncan have this one well it seems to me\nthat there are a tremendous number of\nparallels between strength and\nhypertrophy\nchanges and neuroplasticity this is\ncoming up again and again in this\nconversation\num because we know for instance that if\nyou are exposed to a couple of different\nlanguages early on in life you will\nlearn any number of different languages\nfar more easily later in life of course\nand that's because there's some\ncrossover between different languages\nespecially Latin based languages that\nallows for that there's a substrate for\nit it's similar to the the ability to\nhop on a bicycle again phenomenon or\nplay an instrument phenomenon but it's\nbroader than that and again I think this\nspeaks to the huge number of different\nadaptive changes that are occurring in\nthe cells and in the nerves that\ninnervate these cells when one\nexperiences increases in strength and\nhypertrophy so to round that out\num and to go back to what I was saying\nthere what we're actually learning now\nis that nucleation thing\nand by the way this entire trajectory\nstory is probably over the last like\neight years like this is how fast we've\nchanged our understanding of how muscle\ngrows uh the sarcoplasmic reticulum\nthing five years ago was was Bro Science\nnow it's it's pretty well established\nthe mononucleation thing was eight to\nten years ago it's changing every week\nthis paper we just submitted this week\nshowed actually why we had generally\nthought a few years ago and in fact you\ncan find me on podcasts and probably in\nsome of my videos talking about this and\nI'm going to tell you right now those\nthings are wrong like we've just had new\nthings come out these last couple years\nwhere that D training effect we thought\nwas a reason of well what happens is if\nyou had the muscle before\nand you've brought in these nuclei and\nthey differentiated and turned into into\nnuclei\nand then the muscle got small again you\nwould preserve those nuclei and that's\nwhy when you go to train again they were\nalready around so the muscle grows\nfaster the second time they did the\nfirst time well now it looks like that's\nactually not the case in fact it's\nactually probably hap what's happening\nis it's a it's a epigenetic change\nin the nuclei's ability to access the\nDNA needed to grow muscle it's\neffectively\nthe analogy we used it's the nuclei are\nremembering how to ride a bike so it's\nquite funny that you said that because\nit's not really necessarily that they're\nbeing preserved over time they have\nlearned the sequence it takes to grow\nthe protein there and it goes it happens\nfaster the second time and we've also\nlearned that there are specific nuclei\nwe've known this for actually a while we\nfound this in our lab and we didn't\nDiscover it we just we saw this in our\nsum of our Harbors but there are\ndifferent shapes the nuclei some are\nmore oval some are more elongated and\nthe shape determines a lot of the\nfunctions some of them are hanging out\nmore towards the periphery and some of\nthem are hanging out right around the\nnucleus well it looks like there's\nactually probably different types of\nnuclei a lot of them that are specific\nto the mitochondria in fact you can see\nlike on some of the Imaging we have\nyou're just like they're just packed\naround the the ma the mitochondria and\nthere are some that are probably\nspecific to injury repair\nand so this is probably explaining a lot\nof the the individual variation I mean I\nknow you've you've said previously like\nyou're just a very you're very slow at\nrecovery\nthere's a lot of things that go into\nthat and I would I would love to walk\nthrough sort of all the buckets uh maybe\nlater into recovery but one of the\ninherent genetic variations this could\nbe simply that you maybe have more or\nless of the nuclei responsible for\ntissue repair\num that's something that's been\nhappening in the last like handful of\nmonths that's been coming out we'll see\nif that holds up as true or not\num so as we're learning more and more\nalmost every day about muscle physiology\nwhat's super fun and interesting and I\nthink the most exciting\nwhat to do in order in terms of like how\nto train and how to eat and how to do\neverything else to get these adaptations\nhas been pretty well established for a\nlong long time we're just figuring out\nhow like what's happening in the muscle\nnow but we know what to do so from a\npractical standpoint putting together\nprotocols for any outcome that you want\nor don't want\nfor any modality you don't have a gym\nyou have uh weights you have dumbbells\nonly you only have kettlebells you don't\nwant to you only use body weight we can\nyou only have three days a week you have\nseven days a week you wanna maximize\nmuscle growth you want to get a Little\nBit Stronger any of these variables you\nwant to throw at me we have a large\nevidence base for exactly how to get\nthose adaptations and not others so\nwhile we have a lot to learn about the\nmechanisms and the physiology we have\npretty good legs to stand on in terms of\nwhat to do to get whatever adaptations\nyou want so what are the essential\ncomponents of an effective strength and\nhypertrophy protocol okay so what I\nwould like to actually do is is walk you\nthrough both of those because as we\nmentioned before they overlap but the\ntraining needs to be differentiated so\nthat you can optimize either strength\nhypertrophy or if you actually want you\ncan get a combination of both this\nallows you to then get the adaptation\nyou want avoid ones you don't want and\nthen get it even a combination if that's\nthe preference so a lot of people will\ntalk about I want to get a little\nstronger I want to add some muscle\nthat's a different answer than someone\nwho wants to truly maximize muscle which\nis a different answer from somebody who\nmaximizes wants to maximize strength\nwhich is a different answer from\nsomebody wants to Max my strength but\nnot actually gain muscle so we have all\nthese combinations what's important to\nunderstand before we get into the\ndetails\nthere's a couple of things number one\nwe've been teasing this concept so far\nof the concepts are few but the methods\nare many and so I want to hit those\nConcepts right now these are as you as\nyou say these are the non-negotiables\nthat have to happen in any training\nprogram and I'm referring to these in\nthe strength and I particular\nconversation but these are true of power\ndevelopment speed development muscular\nendurance uh endurance any other thing\nthese are things that just have to\nhappen for any training program to work\nI mentioned one uh a little bit earlier\nwhich was adherence and so that my\nfrequent collaborator Dan Garner will\nconstantly say consistency beats\nintensity\num again in fact the literature will\nshow you very clearly inherence\num is the number one predictor of\nphysical fitness outcomes so we want to\ndo something that you will engage in\nwe'll uh you'll put effort into and\nyou'll be able to repeat consistently\nover time so that's number one\nthe second one is and this is a major\nreason that people don't hit their\nfitness goals in fact I would argue\noutside of not doing it the number one\nmistake they make is Progressive\noverload so I'm going to walk you\nthrough exactly how much you should be\nincreasing\num your sets and Reps and weight Etc per\nweek per month later but that's the\nbiggest thing you have got to have some\nsort of overload the body works as an\nadaptation mechanism right so in fact we\ntalked previously about the Harvard\nfatigue lab and one of the things\nactually people don't realize is the\nconcept of homeostasis is actually comes\nfrom research of the Harvard fatigue lab\nit was um work that they did on an\nendurance Runner I forget his name and\nthey sort of realized that after a long\nperiod of time working out this is an\nacute exercise spell the body actually\ncomes back to some stable place despite\nthe fact he was continuing to work and\nthat's exactly what bore the phrase\nsteady state\nand that actually then they launched off\nand said wow there's this state that the\nbody wants to be in and we'll call this\nhomeostasis so those all Concepts came\nout of exercise physiology which is\nreally really cool right um we don't get\na lot of love a lot of times\nscientifically but that's a good one\nthat we took so why that all matters is\nwe have got to achieve some sort of\noverload without uh going excess so\nwe'll cover that later uh exactly what\nto do and we'll potentially get into\nover training and monitoring and\nmattering things like that but you have\nto have some sort of consistent\npredictable overload that's what's going\nto cause adaptation to continue to cause\nstress if you don't do that you can\nstill do things like burn calories you\ncan still get some of the other benefits\nof exercise like improved mood cognitive\nfunction\netc etc flexibility increases all those\ncan happen without a progressive\noverload but if you want to see these\ngains in strength and hypertrophy you\nreally need to progressively overload so\nthat's concept number two\nthe third one here is going to be\nindividualization and this is where we\ncan get into things like personal\npreference\nyou know equipment availability you have\nkettlebells or dumbbells you only have\nbands we have none of that these are all\nsmaller details but that's an important\ncomponent to it\nthe last one I really want to get into\nis picking the appropriate Target and we\nwent through this when we talked about\nthe fitness protocol and and if you run\nthrough something like that and you run\nsome testing and figure out where your\nbiggest limitations are that's going to\nhelp you identify where you need to go\nso if you can do all those things\nyou're going to be in a good spot to\nbalance specificity\nand variation\nall right so if you want to make sure\nyou grow your biceps you better make\nsure your biceps are working having said\nthat if you over rely on specificity\nyou're going to increase the likelihood\nof overuse injuries which is going to\ncome back and actually hamper\nconsistency over time\nall right so this is when hedging\ntowards specificity is important but too\nmuch can cause a problem if you go the\nother direction and you go with too much\nvariation so imagine you're just sort of\ndoing all kinds of different exercises\nevery time you you work out that's\nactually not enough stimuli directly on\nthe muscle or muscle groups or movement\npattern if you're wanting to learn a new\nmovement\num to get you very far and so this is a\nclassic problem of I'm doing a lot of\nwork but I don't have a very clear\nDirection I lack specificity so I'm\nworking but I'm not seeing a lot of\nimprovements and this is like in the\nbusiness World Etc this is like doing a\nwhole bunch of different things means\nyou get nothing really done so that's\nthe game we're gonna play here right how\ndo we overload this stuff how do we make\nsure we're balancing specificity and\nvariation how do we make sure I want to\ndo this and then how do I individualize\nit for my needs and circumstances and\nand movement restrictions and of time\navailability and my calendar and desires\nand all these things so those are the\nconcepts we absolutely have to hit\nthe methods that we choose\nrun across a handful of variables and we\ncall these things modifiable variables\nbecause as you modify them or you make\ndifferent choices within these variables\nyou get different outcomes or\nadaptations this is exactly what\ndetermines the nine adaptations that\nwe've been talking about so the way that\nI like to say this is\nexercises do not determine adaptation\nso you can't simply go I want to get\nstronger therefore I'm going to choose\nthese exercises\nthat's not how it works what determines\nadaptation is the execution\nof the exercises so a deadlift is my\nfavorite example a deadlift is a common\nexample that people think of when they\nwant to choose a lower body strength\nexercise but a deadlift will not\nincrease your strength unless you're\nexecuting it in the proper fashion I'm\nnot even talking about technique here\nI'm talking about these modifiable\nvariables the same thing for power\nexercises we'll commonly see mistakes of\ndoing uh activities like a box jump\nwhich is great people think oh I'm going\nto improve my power\nwhich we know is extremely highly\ncorrelated to activities of daily living\nand particularly living unassisted as\nyou age right is reduction in power so\nthey'll do an activity like a box jump\nwhat they're failing to realize is\nunless you do it powerfully\nyou won't actually increase power\nif you don't move fast you won't get\nfaster so the the way that we manipulate\nthese variables is everything to\ndetermining the adaptation you get or\nagain don't get so with that Foundation\nI think we can kind of run right into\nthese things and we can start off with\nperhaps speed and power and what I would\nlike to do is walk you through\nall those modifiable variables what to\ndo with them and then hit you with as\nmany different methodologies as we\nreally have time for\nand then we'll move on to strength and\nhypertrophy and kind of round the entire\nthing out and then maybe at the end we\ncan talk some other variables like\nwhat happens if I have a training\nprotocol\nand I'm halfway through and I can't\nfinish my workout what should I do\nreduce my weight or reduce my duration\nor things like that so there's lots of\nwhat-if scenarios that we can go through\nthat potentially a lot of people\nlistening have questions about so sound\nlike a plan sounds like a plan\nI'd like to take a brief break to\nacknowledge our sponsor inside tracker\ninside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term health and well-being can\nonly be analyzed from a quality blood\ntest one issue with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there however is that\nyou get information back about various\nlevels of lipids and hormones and\nmetabolic factors Etc but you don't know\nwhat to do with that information inside\ntracker makes knowing what to do with\nall that information exceedingly easy\nthey have a personalized platform that\nlets you see what your specific numbers\nare of course but then also what sorts\nof Behavioral do's and don'ts what sorts\nof nutritional changes what sorts of\nsupplementation would allow you to bring\nthose levels into the ranges that are\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com huberman to get 20 off\nany of inside tracker's plans again\nthat's insidetracker.com huberman to get\n20 off so just interrupt briefly and\nmake sure that I and everybody else have\nin mind the proper nine adaptations that\nwe've been referring to and that were\ndiscussed in detail in episode one\nI have listed number one skill and\ntechnique number two speed number three\npower which is speed times Force number\nfour strength number five hypertrophy\nnumber six muscular endurance number\nseven\nanaerobic capacity number eight maximal\naerobic capacity and number nine long\nduration steady state exercise yep you\nnailed it thank you for for that it was\nprobably important clarification for\neverybody\num so that being said let's jump right\ninto speed and power now I'll do these a\nlittle bit simultaneously they are\ndifferent if you're a high performance\nathlete you really need to separate\nthese two things\nfor the most people that we can probably\nthink about them is is the same thing\nthere's not a lot of pure speed training\nthat the general public is is interested\nin um if you want to actually further\nbreak down speed there are multiple\ncomponents there's acceleration there's\ntop end velocity there's change of\ndirection or agility and things like\nthat so we'll just kind of call All That\nspeed and power for now now at the onset\nthere's this three to five concept that\nwe talked about many times\nwhere this is really fairly true for\nspeed power or strength now I I didn't\ndevelop the three to five it's just an\neasy way to help you remember one\nconcept that will run true across all\nthese things so three to five it refers\nto\nthree to five days per week\nuh pick three to five exercises and\nyou're gonna do three to five\nrepetitions per set\nyou'll do three to five sets and you'll\nrest three to five minutes between each\nset\nif you do that and you execute any of\nthe exercises that you choose at a high\nintent and that part is critical you\ndon't get faster by moving kind of fast\nyou can't improve Power by moving like\nand powerfully you have to be trying\nregardless of whether actually moving\nfaster or not\nanytime you're talking about speed or\npower you're by definition using sub\nmaximal weights so you're going to be\nable to lift it that's not the question\nthe question is how fast can you lift\nthat Implement and so intention is\nincredibly important so if you do that\nthe same for strength by the way\nso if you land on that that allows you\nto run the gamut from as little as three\ndays a week\nyou're doing a three exercises you're\ngonna do three sets of three which is a\nvery very low volume it's a a very low\namount of days easy to handle all the\nway to five sets of five of five\nexercises five days a week so it it's\nagain it's just one sample that's\nsomething easy to remember and is quite\neffective for a very long time and this\nhas been tested quite extensively in in\nboth the coaching Realms as well as the\nscientific Realms to be quite productive\nand easy to follow and grasp if you do\nthat all you need to do is slightly\nincrease the load\nor the volume but mostly the load over\ntime and the number we want to look for\nthere is something like a three to five\npercent increase\nper week so an example would be if\nyou're going to do\nan exercise at 100 pounds you can't\nnecessarily just add five pounds every\nweek that's going to touch you pretty\nquickly and so you may have to run some\na smaller increment if you're doing like\na lower body exercise where you might\nhave a couple of hundred pounds on the\nweight you can probably get away with\nadding five pounds because it's still a\nlow percentage of the total load so\nthat's roughly uh the guide that we want\nto get to for speed power and strength\nso that sounds incredibly simple and\neffective\nyet I have a number of questions\nfirst off\nif somebody is using the three to five\napproach does that mean they should not\nbe doing any other weight training of\nany kind\nin those workouts or at all\nno you can certainly do that in\ncombination with anything else you would\nlike especially if you think about speed\nand power those are very non-fatiguing\nand so if you can imagine you're going\nto go to the beach and you're going to\ntake a 10 pound to 20 pound medicine\nball with you and you're going to do you\nknow four different exercises or you're\nthrowing the medicine ball as high as\nyou can in the air four times in a row\ntaking a break and you two or three hits\nthat you do maybe three or four\ndifferent types of throws that's very\ngood for improving power extremely good\nbut it's not very fatiguing so you could\ncertainly finish that workout in 20\nminutes and then run on and then do any\nnumber of other things so you could do\nsome high intensity and aerobic capacity\nwork you could do steady state stuff you\ncould you could even do hypertrophy on\ntop of that so there's a there's two\nmajor categories of what we call\nperiodization there's there's many many\nof them but the two that have the most\nscientific literature are what's called\nlinear periodization\nand another is called undulating or\noften daily undulating periodization and\nI'm flagging these two\nagain despite the fact there are many\nmany more because they represent two\ndifferent concepts which you actually\njust touched upon so linear\nperiodization is a hallmarked by\nbasically saying we're going to train\none adaptation at a time so imagine\ngoing say six to eight weeks and you're\nonly doing strength or you're only doing\nhypertrophy you're endurance for that\nmatter so in that particular case\nyou you would not do anything else in\ncombination\nif you contrast that to undulating\nperiodization you would actually be\ndoing multiple different styles of\ntraining even with either within the\nsame day\nor just different days so it could be\nMonday is power Wednesday is strength\nFriday's hypertrophy whatever or it\ncould be a little bit of strength every\nsingle day a little bit I perch for\nevery day a little bit of power every\nday and you would just change the amount\nof each that you do within the day to\nalter the emphasis all right now\nif you look at the studies and there\nhave been many uh rcts on this\nthe result of both of these training\nprograms is generally basically the same\nthing they are equally effective\nhere's the major difference though one\nif your goal is very specific to one\noutcome you want a hedge toward\nspecificity so if you're like hey I'm\ntrying to maximize the amount of muscle\nI can build in the next eight weeks then\nyou don't really anything else besides\nthat is just distraction and potential\ninterference\ndoes it really matter or not it doesn't\nmatter but it's not helping anything\nelse\nso linear periodization is is\nfundamental at providing focus and\ntherefore the the adaptations tend to be\noftentimes larger in that specific area\nthat downside is you now go six to eight\nto ten weeks of doing nothing else and\nso you were losing those other\nadaptations that are great at a faster\nrate and you can imagine doing something\nlike speed work only again speed work by\ndefinition is non-fatiguing so when\noftentimes we think of speed work it's\nlike oh I did ladder drills and I did\nall these things and like I threw up at\nthe end\nthat's not speed work you just did a\ndifferent type of endurance training\nokay which is great and important so\ntrue speed work is very high rest\nvery low fatigue and actually truly\ntrying to reach a new level of speed or\nvelocity\nso non-fatiguing if you did that\nexclusively for 10 weeks you would be\npretty unfit by the end of it because\nyou did you would also lose a decent\namount of muscle mass not because\nthere's an interference effect but\nsimply because the fact you have not\nstimulated muscle growth for eight to\nten weeks and so neither one of these is\nbetter than the other we're going to see\nthis classically across all program\ndesign or periodization strategies is\nit's just a it's a give and take there\nare tons of different systems and and\nperhaps at the end we can talk about\nsome of the more advanced periodization\nStyles these ones are are both effective\nyou could do these with beginners you\ncould do these with Advanced athletes\nyou can do them any Spectrum but they're\nthey're some of the more well-documented\nones it's just a pro and con game right\nit's what are you willing to give up\nthe way that you solve that problem is\ngoing back to that fitness assessment\nand your analysis and really truly\nunderstanding what your goal is is your\ngoal to do a little bit of strength and\na little bit okay great maybe undulated\nperiodization is an approach if your\ngoal is really to maximize strength\nand maybe you can wait on putting some\nmuscle mass on maybe a linear\nperiodization is a better report or\nanother style of periodization that's\noptimal for strength gain so it's just\nsimply about addressing your things one\nof the major problems folks have in\naddition to lacking Progressive overload\nis they don't have any foresight past\nthe next day of the training right and\nso it's really important that you set\noff blocks that are anywhere between six\nto 12 weeks long\nwhere you're going to have the specific\nplan ideally you have an idea for the\nwhole year I actually have like a\nstructure I could walk you through for\nthat but even if you don't have that\nreally think about what you want the\nnext 12 weeks and then maybe the next 12\nweeks after that and that's going to\ngive you a lot of guidance about what to\ndo and what to focus on\nterrific what about warming up\nI was taught that one should do higher\nrepetition movements with lighter\nweights in order to warm up and then one\nof the things that did make a big\npositive difference for me in terms of\nstrength and hypertrophy training was to\ndo a moderate repetition warm-up with a\nfairly lightweight but then to actually\nkeep the number of warm-up repetitions\nfairly low\nand work progressively toward the first\nso-called work set when you say three to\nfive\nthat's three to five work sets correct\nyep\nare you also going to tell me three to\nfive warm-ups no are you also going to\ntell me it has to be done between three\nand five pm\nso in terms of five friends in all\nseriousness uh what does a good warm-up\nlook like yeah and I realize this will\nvary depending on how cool your training\nenvironment is time of day Etc but as a\nkind of umbrella for a good warm-up okay\nwhat should people do\nthe you've already sort of jumped the\ngun with with my answer it it is\nhonestly very dependent upon the person\nso some folks respond very well to a\nminimum work well others I've had lots\nof actually\num professional fighters I've worked\nwith where they'll actually have a major\nleague baseball player right now he's\none of the best pitchers in the game\nprobably the best and the longer we warm\nup the better his numbers get we\nactually did a vertical jump test with\nhim he's gonna kill me because he got so\nmad uh I wanted to see how long it sort\nof took him to reach a peak vertical\njump\nand most times this takes people\nsomething like five to ten sort of reps\nand I said take it up all the way to a\nmaximum vertical jump\nand then what I want you to do is\ncontinue to Jumping until you have three\nconsecutive jumps or you're down lower\nthan 90 percent\nand so what we're trying to look at is\nsort of when is he going to break\nbecause in baseball he's going to throw\nlike 100 pitchers or so and we're trying\nto figure out when is his Peak velocity\non his fastball gonna drop and sort of\nbasis conditioning on that so it's a\ndifferent style of conditioning it's\npower endurance is really what it is\num he called me in the middle of it I'm\nlike oh you're done whatever and he's\njust like no like how many of these am I\nsupposed to do\nand I was like what are you talking\nabout he's like I'm on rep 130 or\nsomething and I was like what\nand I'm like what rep did you peek on he\npeeked on rep 70. something like that 69\nI think technically because he's goofy\num so he's a classic example I've worked\nin for many many years we have a ton of\ndata on him a ton of biological data a\nton of um neural muscular stuff like all\nkinds of stuff and it just the more he\nwarms up an absurd amount of warm-up the\nbetter he gets and the better he gets in\npower production and the better he gets\nin speed and velocity so his warm-up\nprior to games is it's totally absurd\nand just the more volume we throw at him\nthe better he does I have other folks\nyou get past like two or three reps and\nfatigue starts to set in and now you're\nactually like reducing power production\nso there is a ton of variation that goes\nin that I can give you some guidelines\nthough\nyou need to differentiate if you're\ntraining for speed power strength or\nhypertrophy here's why\nif we understand a little bit about\nwhat's causing the adaptation that's\ngoing to tell you what you need to do or\navoid for example\nvolume is the primary driver in\nhypertrophy\nintensity is the primary driver in speed\npower and strength\nall right which what that means is you\nneed to preserve intensity for the first\nthree you need to preserve volume in the\nsecond one at most so if your warm-up is\nso extensive in the hypertrophy training\nthat it compromises your training volume\nbecause of fatigue even if it\ncompromises the last set of the last\nexercise then you're actually probably\nwalking yourself backwards by doing that\nextensive you would have been better off\nstarting your first working set slightly\nsub-optimal\nright because it's not really you're\njust trying to accrue volume at that\npoint\nstrength Empower is the opposite\nuntil you're moving very very fast or\npowerfully you're not really causing the\nadaptation so there's no point of\nstarting your working set until you're\nreally basically at a hundred percent so\nthe warm-up should be as long as it\ntakes you to get to where your Mobility\nis in the right spot like your joints\nfeel good you feel fresh you feel\nactivated and you really feel Peak power\nanything before that is a warm-up set in\nthe sport of Olympic weightlifting a lot\nof times the coaches will measure\nbarbell velocity Travis Mash has done a\nfantastic job with this he's got a lot\nof data on what's called velocity-based\ntraining I'm Brian Mann at Missouri and\nMiami tons of work here and generally\nthose communities are not going to count\nany repetition as a working set until\nyou exceed 70 of your one rep max\nwhere that's changed because of a lot of\npeople doing the velocity-based stuff is\nnow they're basing that simply on an\nachieved velocity\nand so really the warm-up is irrelevant\nthey don't even it's sort of just like\ndo whatever you want and we're going to\nmeasure the barbell until you actually\nhit an outcome and now you're at what a\nworking set\num so different ways to think about it\num depending on what you're training for\nthat'll give you a little bit of a\nguideline if you're training for\nanything past hypertrophy then really\nand especially even hypertrophy it just\ncomes down to\nare you feeling\num ready to work are you cold are you\nmoving to the correct positions and if\nall those things are fine I don't care\nif you start a little bit early and save\nsome gas then especially if you're a\nperson like you who may be a bit more\ninclined to fatigue quickly relative to\nTrevor who's just has no response to\nfatigue whatsoever\nis it useful to do more warm-up at the\nbeginning of a workout say before the\nfirst exercise and then once one has\nachieved both local and systemic warm-up\nin air quotes\num then perhaps on the second or third\nexercise fourth exercise Etc\none or maybe even zero warm-ups yeah\nfair point we generally think about\nwarm-ups in a couple of ways this is a\nreally actually this is a very clever\nquestion\nyou want to have some sort of General\nGlobal warm-up scheme we tend to prefer\nDynamic warm-ups so this is whole body\nmovements rather than like sitting and\nstretching static stretching things like\nthat so something that involves momentum\nyeah momentum or movement right so this\nis like\nuh\nthink about this in like old gym class\nit's like your high knees and your butt\nkickers and just different things like\nthat where you're moving in different\nplanes you're moving joints through tons\nof range of motion you're getting a lot\nof movement there so you're getting the\nlocal warm-up you're also getting the\nthe total systemic activation everything\nelse is going on there so that is what\nwe consider to be a general warm-up five\nminutes\nis a very sufficient number perhaps 10\nif you're a slow goer achy and some\nthings like that and you really got to\nget the ankle warmed up if you're doing\nlower body stuff really make sure that\nthat's moving correctly the hips and\nknees will follow\num upper body stuff really get the\nshoulder blades and the neck like making\nsure you're going there and the elbows\nwill follow after that\num so five to seven minutes of a general\nwarm-up a lot of times like classic\nexercise science it will even just put\nyou on a bike cycling for five minutes I\ndon't like that personally Dynamic\nmovement is more preferred if you really\njust move for five to seven minutes\nyou'll be fine there now specificity\nwithin each movement it's very important\nthat your first exercise of the day is\ngenerally the thing you've prioritize\nthat's oftentimes the most important\nyou're going to do it often times is\nalso the most complex and the most\nmoving parts so it tends to be\nmulti-joint it tends therefore you need\nto have movement precision and skill\ndiode right you don't typically start\nyour workouts off with the forearm curl\nall right like this you don't need a\ntremendous amount of warm-up to get\ngoing on that you're going to start off\nwith medicine ball throws or a snatch or\nsome agility work you you need to have\nthe whole system going because multiple\njoints are moving position matters\ntechnique there's just a lot of skill\nrequirement\nEtc\nso the individualized workout\num or the specific workout for the\nspecific movement for that very first\none\nmy general rule of thumb is like\nwhatever it takes\nto move perfect in that first exercise\npast that you don't necessarily need to\ndo individualized warm-ups for your next\nmovements unless it is a movement you're\ntrying to learn or just even get a\nlittle bit better at\nlike drop the load a little bit work on\nsome accruing some practice reps\nfantastic or it's another dissimilar\ncomplex movement so let's say your first\nexercise was\na front squat and you got loaded for\nthat and now you're going to move into a\npull-up but your mechanics aren't the\nbest there and so you really need to\nchange and do some maybe more specific\nactivation warm-ups for that or\nsomething else or it's running or\nsomething totally different so yeah you\ndon't need to re-warm up for every\nsingle exercise as you go generally once\nyou're good to go the same muscles that\nyou're going to use in the next exercise\nare warm same joints\nthen you're good to go\nyou talked about intent\nwithin the movement\nwhat about specific cadences for\nrepetitions yeah I was taught that one\nshould lower the weight slowly the\nso-called eccentric portion of the\nmovement and then to try and\nexplode the weight through the\nconcentric phase and then also make sure\nthat one is using full range of motion\nand perfect form yeah as it were now of\ncourse that is one tiny slice of the\npossible\nrep cadences and ways to approach\nresistance training although I think\nit's a pretty good one yeah what are the\ngeneral parameter sets that one needs to\nconsider you could imagine lifting you\nknow four seconds concentric pause for\none pause for two\neccentric I realize there's an infinite\nnumber of variations here yeah but is\nthere a way to use rep Cadence\nrepetition Cadence that is as a way to\nwork through weak points\num and to be strong in every position of\nthe movement yeah a lovely question I\nthink the\nthe way I would like to answer this\nis\nmaybe going back just a touch to get\ndirectly to that so I think if we walk\nthrough Power strength and hypertrophy\nand I hit you with the concepts that are\nspecific to each one\nthat's going to lay out your answer\nbecause the most true answer there is it\ndepends on the goal the answer for what\nis optimal for strength is diametrically\nopposed for potentially what's optimized\nhypertrophy the same exact thing can be\nsaid for momentum so we've classically\nheard things like this you know don't\nbounce at the bottom you're cheating\nright so if you're doing a lap pull down\nor something you know you don't you\ndon't bounce and rebound you don't you\nstop at the bottom slow down all these\nthings are thought to be truisms of\nstrength conditioning but guess what\nthose are all truisms assuming\nor trying to grow muscle\nand that's that actually goes back to\nour conversation and and episode one\nabout a lot of the things we think are\njust fundamental truths about strength\ntraining are just fundamental truths\nthat came from the bodybuilding world\nand they're not wrong they're good ideas\nbut they're all their adaptations one\nneeds to get from strength training that\nare not just maximizing muscle growth so\nwhat I will lay out to you is a case for\nwhich you should bounce\na case for when you should go fast a\ncase for when you should be under\ncontrol all these things are are\ndifferent variables we can modify and\nget different adaptations for it is\nthere a way that you could lay out for\nus\noptimal repetition cadences for\nstrength specifically versus hypertrophy\nspecifically just to sort of bookend the\nconversation and then migrate toward the\nmiddle in terms of rep cadences that\nwould satisfy the desire to have a bit\nof both we can get pretty close\nyeah so when you're talking about\nstrength versus hypertrophy remember\nstrength is a movement\nhypertrophy is muscle size\nthat's that's the the key to your answer\nhere so when you're trying to get\nstronger what you're effectively trying\nto do is get better at producing a\ncertain amount of Force 3 movement okay\nnow Force\nis mass times acceleration\nso what's the mass in the bar multiplied\nby how well I can accelerate it\nintentionally going slower\nis only reducing acceleration\nright so it's hard to argue that going\nslower\nis going to improve strength because\nyou're simply reducing acceleration\nso you need to practice\nlifting heavier at a faster rate now\ndoes that mean if you're trying to get\nstronger there are no phases of your\ntraining in which you'll slow down or\nplus no of course not there are certain\nrules in different organizations where\nyou have to pause the bottom like\nthere's all kinds of little things like\nthere but in general we want to think\nabout what are we trying to do here\nwe're trying to get better at moving a\nheavier Mass\nat a faster rate of acceleration that is\nmore force that is more strength\nhypertrophy is not that\nthe goal here is not a functional\noutcome it is what is needed to cause\nthe most amount of hypertrophy\nand when you get to ipertory then your\noptimal Cadence\nis up to you\nyou can do any combination in fact you\ncould do it the same exact Cadence that\nyou did your strength training with and\nget the same adaptations as a poetry if\nyou modify the other variables\nappropriately or you could go slower or\nyou could do pauses or you could do a\nthing that is called triphasic training\nwhere you spend the first phase several\nweeks of your training where you do\neccentrics only so you're just lowering\nthe bar and you're basically stopping\nyou can then do the next phase of your\ntraining which is isometrics you're just\nholding at that bottom position and then\nthe next phase you're training you're\nfocusing on the concentric portion of it\nright triphasic one two three eccentric\nisometric concentric so that's a\nfantastic way of developing actually\nstrength a little bit of hypertrophy but\nyou're manipulating the variables in\nterms of how you execute the repetition\nrange you can actually induce a lot of\nhypertrophy moving the weight fast as\nyou mentioned even down slow under\ncontrol now\none thing one will never Advocate is\nmoving any sort of weight or load\nuncontrolled the Assumption here when\nI'm saying go fast is you're always in\ncontrol I never want you bouncing and\ncrushing your sternum with the barbell\nOff Your Dust but you you can move at a\nlot of rates you can um the isometric I\nmentioned because this is when things\nlike body weight training come into play\nabsolutely you can gain strength and\neven a little bit of hypertrophy\nespecially in the upper body doing\nisometrics is much harder to do this but\nthe lower body\num you just you just you outrun that\ncoverage really quickly you need load\nbut there's a lot of ways this is also\nprobably why people have done things\nlike\ngone to yoga only or Pilates or some of\nthese things that are body weight based\nand there's no external load and they've\nactually increased muscle size so I'm\ngetting the picture there are a ton of\noptions in terms of rep cadences\nhowever\ncan we say that one should pick a given\nrep Cadence within an exercise rather\nthan changing it from set to set within\nan exercise or that one should perhaps\neven pick a certain rep Cadence for an\nentire workout I'm suspecting that your\nanswer is going to be it depends yeah it\nis but if you know I'm not going to use\nthe if you had a gun to your head kind\nof situation but if you had a gun to\nyour head what would be the rep Cadence\nthat you would prescribe yeah\nfor strictly strength or as much\nstrength with as little hypertrophy as\npossible and in picking that rep Cadence\nthen it therefore has to thread\nthroughout the entire exercise bout so\nyou're actually right you can because of\nthat undulating periodization stuff I\ntalked about you can actually do this in\na lot of ways so you could do one\nexercise at the beginning where you have\na set Cadence say a three one one it is\nlike a very one so that's con so that's\nLifting for three pause for one lower\nfor one uh be generally the opposite\nokay so the first number is always The\nEccentric generally okay so depending on\nexercise lowering the the weight for a\ncount of three yeah pause for one yeah\nit totally depends on the exercise like\na deadlift starts concentric and\nfinishes eccentric but a bench press\nstarts yeah okay so it's start to finish\nstart to finish is the better way to\nthink about it yeah so in\nI'll clarify actually\nwhen we say 3-1-1 we're generally\ntalking about almost always The\nEccentric is the slower portion\nregardless if it's the first or the last\nright so whether you're doing a bench\npress or The Eccentric is lowering the\nbar to your chest that's the first part\nof the movement one two three pause one\none up which means accelerate as hard as\nyou can the way up that's what you\ndescribe right as opposed to say a row a\nrow which is actually going to be\nstarting off concentric\nso you're going to be pulling that thing\nto your chest as fast as you can under\ncontrol not slamming off your chest\nholding for one second and then taking\nthree seconds to lower it back on the\nrack or on the ground or whatever so the\nreason we do that is somewhat intuitive\nbut it is again to make sure you're not\nadvancing a bar or an Implement onto\nyour physical body at an extremely fast\nrate that that's very difficult to deal\nwith so a three one one is a very\nstandard\num strength protocol that is something\nyou can just run with if that's all you\never wanted to do it'd be absolutely\nfine lower the bar for a count of three\nit actually ends up being approximately\nthree hardly anybody is counting off\nseconds precisely I mean it's I suppose\nit's doable but then pausing briefly yep\nand that brief is almost uh that pause\nis almost\num unmeasurable it is simply are you\nunder control before you transition from\nthe center to concentricular\nconcentration it's just a safety thing\nso once you feel down you've reached\ncomplete range of motion you're ready to\ntransition then just go you don't really\nneed to go like 1000 Watts and then go\nup it's just making sure again we don't\nslam weights off of body parts and that\nfinal one in the three one one the\nexecution of the usually concentric\nportion of of the exercise yep as fast\nas you possibly can okay so that would\nbe for\nthe majority of the outcome being\nstrength yep okay and of course we\nshould acknowledge again there are a ton\nof variations that one could Implement\nthere but that that would be a good\nstarting place on the opposite side for\nsomebody who's mainly interested in\nhypertrophy yeah what would be the rep\nCadence that\num if you had a gun to your head that\nyou would prescribe I would probably do\nthe exact same thing but I would like I\nwould make the last number two\nso three one two\nyou could also just keep three one on it\nis still very fine even exploding on the\ncontrast is still highly effective for\ntraining hypertrophy so if you want to\nkeep it super simple and just make rep\nCadence not a variable that you play\nwith because you have other ones to move\nthat's great if you want to add a little\nbit of time to the concentric phase fine\nit's not going to do it's not going to\nmake enough of a difference for most\npeople for you to really worry about\nI guess that's sort of the point I\nreally want to make this is we're\nclassically this is a classic example of\nwe're deep into a method\nright if as long as you get the concepts\nI talked about earlier whether you want\nto do three one one three two three\nthree three three try phase this is just\na method choice that doesn't mean\nthey're irrelevant they are there are\nsubtle changes within them it's just 80\n20 rule right so 80 of the benefit is\ngoing to be from the concept 20 is this\nsmall thing if you're super into this\nfield or you actually want to work with\na qualified uh certified coach or\nsomething they there's lots of reasons\nto play with this if you're just on your\nown here and running this thing\n311 is fine 312 totally fine anything\nlike that you really just want to make\nsure that in the strength side of the\nequation\nyou're under control and you can add\nenough load to stimulate strength and\nnot get hurt with an acute trauma right\non the hypertrophy side you're just\nwanting to load enough to where you can\nhit volume\nbecause you got to put a lot on there so\nif you want to go lighter if you want to\ngo slower fine you if you go slower in\nyour repetition so maybe even like a\nfive SEC second eccentric a two second\npause a three second Rise that's great\nyou can actually then stimulate the same\namount of hypertrophy and either do it\nwith less weight\nor do it with less repetitions so it's a\nvariable you can play with if you're\nlike hey\nI don't have\nenough weights at my house or I only\nhave a kettlebell or a dumbbell\nhow am I going to stimulate hypertrophy\nyour only option is really doing more\nreps well eventually that that train\nruns pretty shallow okay here's the\nthing you can play with maybe just add\ntime under tension that's what we're\ncalling right just you know do slower\nrepetitions go longer ones and hold it\nso it's a variable that we use to\nindividualize programs rather than\nsomething that you should really be\nfocused on as like a core aspect that's\ngoing to be driving whether or not your\nprogram works it's just a tool we can\nplay with in the what-if scenarios\num I will use this stuff a lot when I'm\ntraveling you can do a tremendous\nworkout in your hotel room just doing\nlike a 10 second eccentric a 10 second\nhold a 10 Centric concentric yeah I've\nhad some decent hotel room workouts\nthey're not my preference but\num by simply doing things like\num 10 second lowering uh handstand push\nup against the door totally\num obviously assisted for me I don't I\ncan't do a free handstand push-up yeah\num I just don't have the skill or the\nstrength or both\num you can do some sort of configured\ndips between the beds or chairs and this\nkind of thing\num squats are great to do in hotels put\nyour back foot up on a on a bed and get\na an amazing split squat workout done\nyeah a lot glute Bridges lots of stuff\nyou can do that yeah with a jump rope if\nyou've ever heard someone jumping in the\nin the morning yeah\num it may or may not have been me it\ncould be any number of things but I am\nknown to skip rope in uh in hotel rooms\num not to get overly detailed but I\nthink there are going to be a number of\npeople wondering about\nhow to breathe during repetitions\nand how to breathe in between sets so\nI'd like to just briefly touch on this\nand this is something that I know we're\ngoing to return to again when we have\nour discussion about recovery but is\nthere a general rule of thumb for how to\nbreathe during repetitions during work\nyep for strength maybe even strength\nversus hypertrophy in in a way that\nmaximizes oxygen input to the system you\nknow keeps you uh alert and conscious\nbut that also protects the body by\ncreating some rigidity in the system\nright because certainly being def with\nall your exhale the body is a very\ndifferent beast in terms of stability\nthan with the body full of air versus\nyou know breathing during the repetition\nmovement there's a maneuver that is long\nbeen uh labeled the valsalva techniques\nso what that really means is you're\ntrying to use air to create\nintra-abdominal pressure and what you're\nreally trying to do is create a cylinder\naround your spine the real issue you\nhave to to play here is regulation of\nblood pressure and spinal stability now\nyou should be able to breathe and Brace\nwhat I mean by that is you should be\nable to create total intra-abdominal\npressure regulate uh spine control while\nbreathing it's just very hard for a lot\nof people to do it's a skill you should\nabsolutely work on you can actually you\ncan do this and you can go around like I\ndo this trick in class and students can\ncome and they can push any part\num of my entire abdomen it's super tight\nand I can talk now it's going to be a\nlittle bit labored you can hear a little\nbit of a difference but you should be\nable to do that if you have to like\nhunch down and you can't even muster\nyour breath and it takes that to create\npressure you're not actually you don't\nreally understand the abdominal control\nnecessary to create that stability so\nstep number one is that's the goal now\nwith the blood pressure thing we have to\nbe careful because a standard blood\npressure ideally if we sat around right\nnow\nit was probably something like 120 over\n80. systolic versus diastolic that's a\nnormal number right high blood pressure\nis something over that well\nwith an acute bout of exercise you can\nsee that number reach as high as like\n450 over 350. which effectively means\nyou have total blood occlusion right\nyour blood pressure is so high blood is\nnot moving anywhere and it's in the\nmiddle of a very heavy set especially\ncomplex movements especially when\nthey're loaded on your body this could\nbe an overhead press or squat variations\nanything like that blood pressure is\ngoing to be a problem and the reason why\nthat matters is that's what's going to\nmake you pass out it's not the fact that\nyou ran out of oxygen in three seconds\nit's the fact that blood pressure got so\nhigh you blocked out and so we want to\nhave we're gonna have to play this game\nof releasing a little bit of the\npressure so we can actually get blood to\nmove a little bit making sure that\nwe don't lose spinal stability so we can\nfinish our workout that's really the\nquestion you asked right how do I play\nthis game of oh I have several hundred\npounds on my back or my chest and I\ndon't want to Exhale\nright so I don't lose spinal stability\nbut at the same time I don't want to\npass out right which is which is a\nproblem so a kind of a couple of rules\nof thumb if you're going to be doing\nsomething in which you can complete the\nentire exercise without a breath\nand it is of a maximal or close to load\nthat's probably your best strategy so in\nthat particular case you'll see a lot of\nbreathing techniques where you're going\nto take a very large inhale\nideally this is done through the abdomen\nnot the shoulders so we shouldn't seeing\nclavicles Rising during this thing\nyou'll see a common mistake of of the\nbars on their back and you see people do\nthis like big inhale thing and all they\ndo is Elevate their collabos that's not\nnecessarily going to increase pressure\nthrough the abdomens which is what\nyou're looking for so you want to be\nthinking about belly moving out in all\nfour areas in front of you to your left\nand right and to your back that's that\nquadrant sort of idea of stabilizing\nyour spine you can do that independent\nof your clavicles moving like your\nshoulders don't need to rise for that\nyou don't really need the oxygen for\nmetabolic purposes you're just using the\nair for a brace that's really all you're\nafter so you're trying to visualize your\ntorso is more or less a cylinder yep and\nyou're trying to fill it with air\nthe logic being that if I were to push\ndown onto a say a full unopened can of\nsoda yep water\nfor all your sugar phobes out there soda\nwater\nuh and then\npush as hard as I could it's going to be\nhard for me to crush that can but if the\ncan were empty or if it were a little\nbit kinked in the middle correct then I\ncould likely Crush that can yeah what\nyou're really doing is you have your\nspinal Erectors in the back right and\nthen a whole series of abdominal\nexercises and you actually have some\nneural control systematic control of\nContracting those but the you don't have\nmuscles on the inside\nthat you can do so you're basically\nbringing in air and saying I'll use air\nto push from the inside out and I'll use\nmuscles to push from the outside in to\ncreate this brace and I don't want over\ncompression with the muscles this is a\nlike if you if you see people that have\njust enormous spinal Erectors\nsometimes that's an indicator of\nactually a poor breathing or bracing\nstrategy because they're using spinal\nrectors to create all their compression\nand not actually using the inside enough\nthat's not always the case but sort of\nlike a thing to think about so over\ncompression through the spinal rectus is\nnot necessarily ideal if you wanted the\nbest scenario is a little bit of a brace\nof both so we use some air to push this\nside we use some musculature depressed\nthat way and then that that spine is\njust nicely\nheld in position again not in a position\nwhere I've locked down my diaphragm and\nI can't get any air out I should be able\nto get that brace pattern and then be\nable to speak in fact like I'm doing it\nright now and you'll see like a little\nbit of if you're really paying attention\nto my voice you can hear a little bit of\na subtle difference but I should be able\nto do this for quite a long time\nright like I I could take a maximum rep\nright here in this position whether I'm\noverhead pressing doing some sort of row\nlike anything and feel very braced in in\nthe entire quadrant\nthis is very helpful I I'm going to work\non it but can we say that a an effective\nway to start off in terms of breathing\nduring repetitions would be to take a\ngulp of air during the lowering phase\nThe Eccentric phase and then to Exhale\nduring the yeah concentric exertion\nphase I asked that because that's what\nI've been doing for a while and it makes\nme feel safe I don't know if I am and it\nallows me to Exhale as I exert the the\nhardest portion of the exercise yeah and\nperhaps I also borrowed that from\nmartial arts where one tends most often\nis trained to Exhale on the on the\nstrike yeah if you're going to be doing\nagain the number of repetitions can be\ncompleted without a breath\na lot of times you're better off saving\nthat exhalation until you complete\nwow but you don't have to but for a\nreasonably heavy set of hack squats or\neven leg extensions and given that I\nalready can't leg extension my body\nweight maybe it's established oh maybe\nthis is why\num the idea of holding my breath for an\nentire compound set so again I'm kind of\nlistening to mine\num you know like where is my insurance\ncard who's going to drive me to the\nhospital this kind of thing\num in all seriousness what if I want to\nbreathe during the set yeah so\nI I'll clarify I'm generally meaning if\nyou're doing like a one rep max\nor something like that okay well they\ncertainly could hold my breath for a one\nrepetition maximum that you know maybe\nlike a double or something like that\ndepending on what you're doing like\nmaybe a triple a bench press you can\nprobably do three\nand get away with it a squat it gets\nharder deadlift so it kind of depends on\nthe exercise\num you want to take that breath though\nprior to The Eccentric portion\nnot during so lower breathe in lock or\nset and now start our movement pattern\nwherever it's going to be exhaling on\nthe concentrate portion during it is\nfine it's no problem\num especially if you're not extremely\nheavy and what's your what are your\nthoughts on grunting and screaming yeah\nfine I don't care I don't tend to do\nthat I'm occasionally known to squeal or\nwhimper\nI think of you and I think squeal\nwhimper absolutely thanks\num if you're going to be doing multiple\nrepetitions\nuh what we actually do for the NFL\ncombine\nis we teach them a very specific Excel\nstrategy so there's one test that they\ndo uh which is they bench press 225\npounds for as many reps as possible a\nlot of these people will get 25 to 40\nrepetitions so we have a very specific\nbreathing pattern it would be something\nlike if we think that they're going to\ndo around 25 reps say that's like our\ngoal we might say okay do the first 10\nwithout a breath and then exhale reset\nand then do five breath and then you\nmight do five breath three breath two\nbreath and then one breath per rep until\nwe can't get any more um so we'll have\nvery specific strategies for them\num so what I would say is think about\nhow many you're going to complete and\nand then breathe according to that and\nit tends to increase in frequency as the\nnumber gets closer to failure because\nyou're going to want that that error a\nlittle bit but you just want to make\nsure that\nwhen you re when you're breathing back\nin you're in a safe spot so you don't\nwant to be catching that like re-breath\nwhen the weight's on you you want to be\nin a locked out position or away from\nyou when you're standing so it tends to\nbe like at the end of the exercise not\nin the middle of it which is is going to\nbe a recipe for problems if you take\nyour breath then\none of the reasons I'm so happy to have\nyou here\nand having this discussion is we can\nreally get into the weeds but also hit a\nnumber of questions that I hear a lot\nhow does one contend with the first\nattempt at a lift not working out is it\ntoo heavy something goes wrong hopefully\nnot injury promoting wrong but something\ngoes wrong do you count that do you\nreset the workout\nand then the counterpart to that\nquestion is\nwhat do you do if it's too easy it went\nwrong because you didn't put enough\nweight on the bar do you pick up a heavy\nenough set of dumbbells do you abandon\nthe set and and replace it with another\nand I guess this is really a question of\nhow much margin for error is there in\nvolume yep when doing this three by five\nprogram sure uh two things\nthat I'd like to start with number one\nis I talked about linear periodization\nand unrelated periodization there's\nactually a new model newish model called\nAuto regulation which basically says\nyou're going to go in today and\ndepending on any number of biomarkers\nperformance markers or your performance\nyou will adjust your training based on\nhow you're feeling that day and so 70 is\nnot maybe for example not necessarily 70\nof your one repetition Max highest ever\nis 70 of what you can actually do that\nday\nand so it actually allows you to Auto\nregulate your training based on actually\nwhat's happening and so you don't have\nto have as much long-term planning in\nyour program design\num because it'll sort of figure itself\nout as you're going you can use velocity\nto determine the sort of Regulation you\ncan use actually it's like taking it up\nto close to a Max for the day and then\nbasing all your percentages on that\ndaily Max or a lot of different ways so\nthat is actually one of very effective\nstrategy and there's a lot of research\ncoming out on auto regulation there's a\nlot of different ways to do it so that's\none thing to say another thing to say is\nthis\nthree to five okay it depends on if\nwe're going for speed power or strength\nbecause while all those other variables\nare the same for three to five\nthe core difference between whether that\nis a power workout or a strength workout\nis the load\nright so if you are at a moderate load\nsay thirty percent of your one\nrepetition Max up to about 70 percent\nthat's going to be a power based\nadaptation assuming you're going with\nhigh intent\ncan you sorry I I have to interrupt\nmaybe just clarify what intent is yeah\nyou're attempting to move the implement\nor go through the movement pattern as\nfast as you can great thank you if\nyou're trying to go for strength and\nyou're below 70 percent\nyou're not really going to be improving\nstrength because the total mass\nis not heavy enough and so really when\nwe say strength we're assuming you're at\nat least generally 70 percent or higher\nnow if you're new to training totally\ndifferent thing right but if you're\nmoderately trained to highly trained\nyou're going to be whale north of 70 so\nanything below that we don't really\ncount anyways um that's those are\nwarm-up sets basically\nall right so one thing to actually give\nyou some very specific numbers here and\nI don't have all of these memorized who\ncan perhaps\num provide a chart later or send out\nsomething to them but there's a chart\nthat you can look up called a prilippin\nchart how do you spell that uh p r i l i\np i n\nand there's actually been a a few\nstudies on it it's it's a it's been old\nit's been around for a very long time\nit's sort of in the coaching realm and\nthen a handful of studies out of New\nZealand came out\nverifying and validating a lot of it but\nwhat it effectively does is if strength\nis the goal and this comes from the\npower lifting weightlifting sort of\ncommunities or optimizing for strength\nthen how much time do I need to spend\nat each intensity range so 70 80 90\nEtc because specificity\nis going to say this if you want to get\nbetter neuromuscular guy at shooting a\nbasketball the most important thing you\ncould ever do is shoot a basketball\nunder the exact circumstances that\nyou're going to do it right specificity\nalways wins if you want to get better at\nstrength the most important thing you\nneed to do is that exact movement at\nthat load and in this case if you wanted\nto get better at\nyour bench press\nlifting at 100 of your max on a bench\npress is the most specific thing you\ncould ever do the more you can do that\nthe faster you will increase your bench\npress Max however that's very hard to do\nwithout getting hurt it's also not\naddressing what I call your Defender so\nif the reason you can't bench press\nhigher than whatever you're benching now\nit may not be your pure strength it may\nbe any number of things like you don't\nhave enough muscle or technique or these\nthings okay great so specificity over\nhere\num variation on the other side so we're\nplaying this game we've talked about of\nhow do I make sure that I can have\nenough specificity in my training\nwithout leading to uh overuse injury all\nhow do I maximize or how do I reduce my\nchance of injury while getting enough\nspecificity and so we have a classic\nParadigm however here one actually\ntraining protocol you can look up is\ncalled a Bulgarian method and the\nbulgarians were an amazing at the sport\nof Olympic weightlifting probably in\nfact the\num the the patriarch of this entire\nthing recently passed away Ivan IBA\njayev uh niams glue pocket Hercules one\nof the greatest weightlifters of all\ntime came out of the system and they do\na lot of things but one example in the\nBulgarian system is you're going to do a\none repetition maximum snatch\nyou're gonna take a little bit of a\nbreak you'll do a one repetition maximum\ncleaner jerk take a little bit of a\nbreak do a one repetition maximum front\nsquat take a little bit of a break and\nyou're gonna repeat that two to three\ntimes a day every day\nthat's specificity right those people\nget extraordinarily strong now they\ndon't do that all year round they don't\ndo that with all their lifters but this\nis when we're trying to Peak for a major\ncompetition like the Olympics we are\ngoing so far\ninto specificity and that was very\ncounter to the Russian system at the\ntime which is much more of our classic\nperiodization sort of approach okay\nspecificity is tremendous but in doing\nthat the bulgarians just brutalized a\nlot of athletes right because it's very\ndifficult to handle something like that\nand you can't really do that that long\nwithout getting wrecked and they're the\ngoal is to win medals the goal is it's a\ntotally different thing than longevity\nout of here right like we're trying to\npush the boundaries of or aesthetic\nchanges unless someone has a naturally\nbalanced Physique in general if people\ndo one sort of movement I find that they\ntend to resemble the equipment that they\ndid that movement with over time right\nthat was a joke against kettlebells of\ncourse of course of course I got it\nso\nwe know specificity is technically\noptimal but it's not realistic not for\nthat kind of a you know extreme\nsituation so how do we balance these\nthings well it turns out this prilippin\nchart gives you guidelines for how much\ntime and by time I mean how many\nrepetitions\nto stand\num in each of these rep ranges so that\nyou get kind of the best of this world\nyou're going to find the same thing by\nthe way when we get into endurance\ntraining there's only so much training\nyou can do at 95 of your heart rate\nbefore it starts becoming like quite\ndetrimental you need to actually spend a\nlot of time at those lower intensities\nso the Philippine chart walks you\nthrough\nhow many sets and it gives you a range\nlike like the I think that the bottom of\nit is like\num how much time do you spend at like 60\nto 70 every one or at Max and it says\nlike you know minimum of this set to\nmaximum of this set but the ideal number\nof reps per set per week is like 18. and\nthen I'll walk you through and so\nthere's there's four criteria on it\num I think it's 55 to 65 again how many\nreps there's it's like three to six reps\nper set\num 18 to 30 reps total and I think the\nideal rep range is like 24. something\nlike that so it takes you 55 to 65 70 to\n80 80 to 90 and the 90 plus percent what\nyou'll see is the 90 plus percent number\nis more like one to two reps per set for\na total of about seven total repetitions\nif you start cruising past that\num\nother bad things start to creep up in\nthere so that's a really effective chart\nwhat it really highlights though is even\nsomebody who's trying to maximize\nstrength\nyou're going to spend something like 30\nfive or so percent of your training time\nbetween this like 55 to 65 range\nso you're asking her like well do I even\ncount that one the answer is yeah you\nknow in that range if it's below 55 60\npercent you probably don't count it now\nagain some coaches don't count unless\nit's even above 70. fine it's not a\nmajor distinction but you're going to\nspend the bulk of your time you know\naccumulating some some technique\nbasically and skill and tissue tolerance\nvery important The Next Step Up is like\n28 I think is is sort of the cutoff of\nhow much time you spend between 70 and\n80 percent of your 100 Max and then it\njumps down to like 23 and then all the\nway to 70 so you can walk yourself\nthrough that and that gives you an\nextremely good guideline and you'll\nnotice all of these are still in three\nto five range it's just really you're\nmanipulating it by total sets or total\nexercises so that can give you some\ninstruction to play with\nwe will provide a link to the prilippin\nChart yeah in the show note captions\ntraining to failure when the goal is\nStrife yeah\nshould one do it should one avoid it\nor does it depend well yeah it always\ndepends um the way that I'll generally\nsay it is because of what we just\noutlined it in the brilliant chart you\ndon't have to go to failure to see\nstrength gains especially early or even\nmoderate and I'm talking maybe five plus\nyears in your lifting career would you\num call beginner zero to five years of\ntraining intermediate five to twenty\nyears of training yeah something like\nthat and then Advance would be people\nthat really put the time and energy into\nfine-tuning their program the vast\nmajority of people who think they're\nAdvanced are really what we would call\nintermediate in all domains of life Fair\neven as a scientist\num it's quite rare to reach that number\nof advance so\num I actually don't have any problem\ngoing to failure quite often I'm also\nfine with people who don't want to go\nall the way there you can get most of\nwhat you need getting what we call\ntechnical failure so this is like okay\nthat was really challenging uh boy you\nstarted to have some breakdowns of\ntechnique we're gonna call that good The\nOnly Exception here I want to point out\nis people who are either novice or\nbeginners they really have no concept of\nwhat 100 means and so I think it's\nactually very fruitful to take them to\n100 just to give them a guideline of\nwhere it's at now of course do this on\nexercises that they are comfortable with\nor close and then you maybe maybe this\nis on a machine maybe this is single\njoint movements or whatever it takes for\nthem to have confidence but I actually I\ndon't think you should be scared of\nthese they're not really um that much\nmore dangerous than anything else\nthere's I mean think about it if you're\ngoing to do a front squat or any\nexercise and your one rep max is 200\npounds is it really that much more\ndangerous to do one try at 205 pounds\nthan it is to do five tries at 190\npounds\nis it really that much more no like it's\nnot so you can do like we talked about\nin the the first episode you can do a\nrepetition Max estimate where you get to\nlike 85 to 95 of where you think you are\nand then instead of adding load you just\ndo as many reps as you can\nGoogle that number and it'll tell you\nthe conversion estimate of what your own\nright Max is that's fine but also I have\nabsolutely no issue in fact I generally\nencourage it to take people up to that\nlevel\num certainly not day one or anywhere\nclose to that but at some point let's\nsee what you actually got\nI'm just I'm just going to cut it off\nearly what I'm going to consider to be\n100 Max anything more than a minor\ntechnical breakdown is is for that crew\nwe're going to stop and call that good\nand ideally with a spotter especially\num you know bench pressing don't bench\npress alone in your basement kind of\nthing a few people die each year from\nbench pressing alone in their basement\nyep or use dumbbells if you're going to\ndo that yeah it's hard harder to die\nusing dumbbells I suppose you could\num drop them on your head or something\nbut not get stuck under them\num\nexercise selection and frequency of\nexercise implementation across the week\nso I can imagine with this three by five\nroutine done three to five times per\nweek you can imagine changing up the\nexercises every workout\nalthough considering that most of these\nthree by five routines are going to be\ndone with compound movements generally\nthe sooner or later one runs out of\nmovements if the goal is to hit major\nall the major muscle groups yeah however\nlet me give an example\nand ask if it's okay\nto for instance do the three by five\nroutine where one of the exercises for\nback is say a bent over row\nuh you do that Monday Wednesday and\nFriday okay you know I can imagine one\ncould do that and still recover and\nimprove over time but five days a week\nbend over rows five days a week is that\nokay I mean can one still progress\num and there I could imagine it's a\nstrong answer of Depends because some\npeople recover more slowly\nand others I'm very comfortable doing\nhitting muscle groups once directly per\nweek and once indirectly that's worked\nfor me far better than two or three\ntimes per week you know I get you know\nlooks of sympathy when when I say this\nbut it's actually it's just how my\nphysiology Works\num kind of yeah well and maybe I'm not\noptimizing a number of different\nfeatures but the point being that some\npeople really do seem to be able to\ntrain a muscle every day and still make\nprogress other people seem to have\ntrouble when they train a muscle every\nday so how does one establish exercise\nselection when the goal is to make\nprogress\num and this brings up something very\nimportant and we're going to have a\nwhole episode about this but local\nversus systemic recovery yep that you\nknow is the whole nervous system\nbecoming fatigued\nand is the muscle group and the related\nmusculoskeletal systems becoming\nfatigued we're going to go back to\nthinking about\nwhen you make these comments about it\ntakes you three to five days and you've\ngot better results in there the\nassumption that you're probably running\nunder is your training Style\nis more reflecting that recovery time\nthan it is your physiology\nit's not you it's how you're training so\nif you look at again all the Olympic\nweight lifters\nthat are competing they're going to be\nsquatting or some variation of squatting\nevery day\nthat that's going to happen like a lot\nof the times they're training multiple\ntimes a day and they will be doing some\nbasically barbell full squat multiple\ntimes a day every day six days a week\nyou know something like that\nthey're the best in the world at getting\npowerful\nthey're tremendously good at getting\nstrong\nyou can do it right it comes down to\nwhat does your volume look like what\ntype of movements are you doing what rep\nrange what overall volume are you\nhitting\nand how are you doing it if you look at\nathletes\nthey train their legs every day\nwhen they're running around they're\ndoing Speed and Agility training every\nsingle day they don't need you know\nthree days to recover can you imagine a\nbasketball player trying to ask for like\nthree days to recover between practice\nright well to be fair as you as you\nchuckle at me I'm doing other things on\nthe intervening days yeah so I'll train\na muscle group like legs and then I'll\ngive it four days before I do an\nindirect yeah um uh what I call an\nindirect exercise for legs which for me\nwould be sprinting yep then I get two\ndays and then I'm training them again\nbut nonetheless an athlete has to do\nthat every day right right so the\nabsolute the answer is you absolutely\ncan train any of these muscles every\nsingle day it really comes down to\nvolume\nright and it comes down to movement type\num and how are you getting it so with in\nthe case of of weightlifters and\nathletes what we tend to see happen is\nthere's not a there's two things there\nis a long period of conditioning and I\ndon't mean endurance what I mean is is\ntissue tolerance and conditioning so\nthey're not going to start off their\ncareer\nat that pace right their career might\nstart off at five days a week but maybe\nevery other of those days is a PVC pipe\nonly and you're just training the\nmovement patterns you're working on\ntechnique Etc and then eventually maybe\nafter six months or a year those PVC\npipe days turn into barbell only days so\nnow you went from you know a pound to 45\npounds and eventually as your years go\non that that wrapses up so it depends on\nthe style in general speed and power\nstuff is so light it almost requires\nbecause it's non-fatiguing it requires\nalmost no amount of no recovery so if\nyou were truly doing say like\num you know when you say it's funny\nbecause when you say I do legs on\nMondays\nyou don't even realize it but an athlete\ndoes legs every day right but you're\nsaying legs and what you're really\nsaying is I do hypertrophy legs Mondays\npretty much that I don't want to get\ninto what I do specifically because it's\nless important than what other people\nchoose to implement but the repetition\nranges anywhere from 4 to 12. correct so\nyou're covering up pretty yeah you're\nsmack dead in the peak soreness\nlongest recovery rate volume is\nrelatively low intensity is very very\nhigh workouts are very very true so if\nyou were to switch that and you were to\nstay under four repetitions higher\nquality uh higher rest in between them I\nwould be willing to bet a large amount\nof money that you'd be fine the next day\ncertainly 48 hours and if you were to\nactually go way lower and keep you know\nthree to five and keep it very very\nlight and train for Speed you would have\nabsolutely no issue\nthe next day so it really comes down to\na function of training you're right in\nthat hypertrophy Zone which is something\nthat you probably need 48 hours at\nminimum to recover from because what you\nwon't see\nare bodybuilders\ntraining the same muscle group on\nmultiple days like very often at most it\nwill be indirect but generally they're\nnot going to do that every single day\nfor the same reason so you're training\nin that style that's what it's going to\ntake to recover if you trained in a\ndifferent style then it wouldn't take\nthat long to recover so for the person\nstarting out\nwould you recommend they pick three to\nfive exercises and stick with those so\nthat they can get their skill and\nmovement and positioning and breathing\nall that really dialed in and then start\nto experiment by varying one or two of\nthose exercises over time that's great\nif you look at the the conjugate model\nso these are the the strongest power\nlifters as a collective group that ever\nexisted what they're very good at is\nthey keep almost the exact same weekly\nstructure but they make a very small\nchange in exercise variation so for\nexample say Wednesday is bench day right\nthey're going to always binge on\nWednesdays but maybe this week they're\ngoing to do close grip bench and then\nmaybe next week it's going to be maybe a\na special type of barbell and then maybe\nthe week after that it's\num you know maybe they'll change the\nrange of motion a little bit so it's\nactually the exact same exercise where\nthey're making a very small variation\nand that change alone allows them to do\nenough specificity\nbut also gives them enough variation\nwhere it's not the exact same stimuli in\nthe exact same spot over and over and\nover and that's what allows that group\nplus lots of other assistance but it's\nwhat allows that group to train very\nvery very heavy\nvery consistently and not have to worry\nabout too much planning for\nperiodization and other stuff like that\nthey get their back off by making small\nvariations in exercise I will say\na major mistake folks do make is they\nchange their exercises entirely way too\noften if I were to have to pick one or\nthe other I would say don't change\nanything on your exercises for six weeks\nprobably realistic maybe even 10 to 12\nweeks and then you can make some changes\nyou should not be changing every single\nweek the general pump you're just you're\nnot going to see progress it's going to\nbe very difficult to do that so it's\ngoing to take you three weeks generally\nto figure out the groove of the exercise\nto figure out how well you can load it\nwhat's too much to where you woke up\nunbelievably sore that was a train wreck\nhow much do I load it at what position\nhow long is this going to take it's\ngoing to take you three or so weeks and\nthen you can really start pushing there\nso changing it before that or in that\ntime frame is is you're not going to be\nable to progressively overload because\nyou're just not going to know exactly\nwhere you're at on all the exercises so\nit's very important to create\nstandardization within them and then see\nsome progress in a movement or a muscle\nGroup whatever you're going for\nand then make some changes\nso before we dive into our discussion\nabout hypertrophy\ncan we just get a brief recap of the\ngeneral parameters for an excellent\npower and strength training program okay\nlet me hit you with these rapid fire and\nyou can maybe come ask questions along\nthat remember those modifiable variables\nokay so let's go through them in order\nand then what they mean specifically for\npower versus strength so modifiable\nvariable number one is called choice so\nwhich exercises do I select for strength\nin general for power or speed or\nstrength we want to select compound\nmovements you don't often see people\ndoing maximum strength work for like a\ntricep Kickback right it's typically\nmultiple joint movements and typically\ncomplex\num movements\nin selecting these compound movements we\ngenerally want to actually think about\nexercise selection of movements rather\nthan muscle groups so this is an\nimportant distinction because we'll see\nthis is a different answer when we get\nhypertrophy what I mean by that is when\nwe think about again strength training\nwe tend to think about bodybuilding\nConcepts we go to the gym and we do\nthings like I got to make sure I get my\nchest today and I got to make sure I get\nmy hamstrings and now you're selecting\nexercises based on a muscle you want to\nwork for strength development and power\nwe want to think about movements rather\nthan individual muscle groups so there\nshould be like things like I need to\ntrain explosive hip extension which is\nlike a a vertical jump or something like\nthat I I want to train pushing or\npulling movements or I want to attain\nroad trip I want to train rotation which\nis a whole area we haven't gotten into\nwhich is very important for overall\nhealth and wellness and Longevity so we\nwant to select big movements by the\nmuscle the movement patterns that we\nwant to introduce and we just want to\nselect a reasonable balance between\nthese I don't care what the exact ratio\nis you just don't want to go an entire\nsix months without doing anything in\nthis rotational area or an entire you\nknow eight to ten weeks without doing\nsomething\nwithout the lower body hinge right so\nany number of examples there so just\nthink about the rough movement patterns\nupper and lower push and pull and then\nsome sort of rotation that puts you in a\npretty good spot if you're using three\nby five method and you're going to pick\nas little as three exercises just pick\none from each one of those group pick a\nrotation\npick a push and pick a pull I can easily\nthink of a pushing a pull so for example\nbench press or shoulder press sure row\nor chin for pull and then squat or\ndeadlift for hinge yep what would be a\ngood example of a quality rotational\nmovement yep so anytime um you can use a\ncable machine like at the gym and you\ncan do it's kind of hard to describe\nthis exercise but basically you're going\nto stand facing the cable and you're\ngoing to pull it towards yourself and\nthen rotate like you're pivoting like\nyour either swing angle golf club or\nhitting a baseball bat so you're facing\nOne Direction I'm facing you right now\nI'm pulling the cable towards myself and\nthen I'm going to spin do a 180 degree\npivot and face exactly away from you\nwhen I finish and then return it back to\nthat same spot so that's a rotation\ngreat we will provide a link to an\nexample of that that you consider a\nquality example a medicine ball throw\nany number of things like this are a\ngreat rotational exercise all right so\nwe select our exercises based on that we\ngenerally then okay because that is the\ncase we don't worry about things like\neccentric versus concentric because\nyou're deadly doing a whole body\nathletic movement right which The\nEccentric concentric portion is going to\nbe folded into that you really can't\nseparate them out all right so that's\nexercise Choice our first variable the\nnext one is exercise order so because\nthat everything driving power and\nstrength is quality based\nyou want to do these at the beginning of\nyour workout you would not want to do\nanything fatiguing before this so no\ncardiovascular training no other\nrepetition to failure stuff if you do\nthose before and now you're slower all\nyou've done is practice getting slower\nand and so these need to be done when\nyou're fresh you also need to do them\nwhen you're very fresh because they are\nthe most neurologically demanding\nthey're complicated they tend to have\nmultiple steps and they're often in\nmultiple planes and coordination is a\ndifficult thing and if you're trying to\ndo all that at maximum speed your\nnervous system needs to be tremendously\nfresh and so any amount of fatigue here\nis only going to compromise the results\num to kind of recap that one of the\nmajor mistakes when training for\nstrength and especially power is people\nworry way too much about fatigue those\nthings should not be part of the\nequation in fact if they are that's a\nvery good sign you're not doing this\ncorrectly right these are non-fatiguing\nmovements especially speed and Power\nso Choice order is next\nthe next one after that is volume and we\nsort of hit volume and intensity which\nis the other one we talked about that\nthe volume is basically identical\nbetween power and strength the the\ngeneral number we're going to look at\nhere is something like 3 to 20 sets\ntotal per workout per workout\num but that would be like 20 would be\na little bit of a special case now three\nto five is what I told you earlier right\nI'm just saying like sometimes you can\nactually go quite higher in this cases\nbut that's the general range and once\nsomebody finishes the three by five\nworkout for power or strength if they\ndecide they want to throw in some calf\nraises and curls and totally a forearm\nwork or a little bit of jogging on the\ntreadmill or something that's okay\nabsolutely there is you have very little\nrisk of interference\nfor things like speed and Power\nstrength you have a little bit of a risk\nonly because now you're introducing\nfatigue which if you're really pushing\nstrength that might compromise your\nrecovery I could imagine doing the three\nto five routine for strength or for\npower and then somebody finishing up\nwith\num 10 or 15 minutes of hypertrophy arm\nwork and then being very seriously\ncompromised if they try and come in the\nnext day or even the next day correct\nand do those big compound movements for\nSpeed and power that's right not just\nbecause they're sore but the muscles may\nactually still be damaged and I know\nlater we're going to talk about the\num somewhat tenuous relationship between\nsoreness and Recovery yeah yep so that\nthat's a that's a really nice uh\nheuristic to pay attention to is you can\nbut just be careful\nEnergy starts to matter at that point if\nyou're really truly trying to maximize\nstrength you would do nothing at all\noutside of that training if you're just\nlike I kind of want to get stronger and\nsome other things and you're willing to\nlose strength you know five percent of\nyour strength gains then you're totally\nfine um the same can be said by the way\nfor super setting so supersetting is an\nidea that says like wait a minute you're\ntelling me dude I gotta take five\nminutes in between each set well that's\nnot so much a problem nowadays with\nphone with um smartphones because people\nare filling their intercept intervals\nwith social media and texting correct\nyou you don't really have to go that\nlong in fact there was actually a study\nthat came out in the last month that\nshowed you know like really two minutes\nis probably sufficient for most people\nhaving said that if you really are\ntrying to push maximal strength\nadaptations like three to five is very\nvery reasonable\num your those training sessions are long\nbecause you have to take you're spending\nmore time not doing anything\nthen you are doing something but you're\ntrying to maximize quality so that's\njust sort of like part and parcel if\nyou're not super worried about it you\ncan actually do super setting which is\nlet's imagine again you're going to do\nsome some lunges and while your legs are\nresting doing their three to five\nminutes you can go over and do an upper\nbody row or pull\nand when your upper body is resting\nyou're going back the legs so that\nreally Cuts your time in half is it\nideal no we actually ran a study uh\nmaybe 10 years ago in our lab and we\nlooked at that specifically and we did\nsee a reduction in strength performance\nin the supersetting group relative to\nthe group who did not superset\nthe question then it becomes like is it\nenough for you to care so if you were to\nif I were to say hey I can cut an hour\noff of your workout time but you will\nlose five percent of your strength gain\nalmost everyone would take that exchange\nwith the exception of people who are\ngetting close to competition or really\ntrying to set a new lifetime PR or\nsomething then you might say no I don't\nwant any interference there that last\nlittle margin is what I care about give\nme the extra rest great so it's not a\ndoes it work does it not work it's\nalways a what are you willing to give up\nuh versus get the practicalities of\nsupersetting are staggering push-pull\npush pull in my mind are real because\nyou have to take over large segments of\nthe gym which oftentimes leads to a\nsituation where your rest times are too\nlong or highly variable because people\nare working in or you can't finish your\nset because now someone jumped into the\nmachine right it totally screws right\nyou lose three to five of your friends\nbecause it's obnoxious when you're\ntaking over all the equipment but in all\nseriousness I think\num it's wonderful if you have the space\nand the format to do it but at least in\nmy experience end observation these\npeople know who they are it's not\npractical to do on a regular basis if\nyou train in an open commercial gym yeah\ntough to pull up so\num\nwe've covered choice\norder volume and intensity to a\nsufficient level the last one is\nfrequency and we've already sort of\nindirectly talked about that where\nfrequency can be as high as you'd like\nin this area it really depends on your\nrecovery if you're really truly pushing\nmaximum strength you probably do need a\nfew days to recover although that's\ndependent upon you but speed and power\ncan be done multiple times a day almost\nevery day basically the one exception\nwould be maximum sprinting speed you\nneed to be careful there for things like\nhamstring and injury especially if\nyou're pretty fast so you want to be a\nlittle bit cautious of that but if\nyou're doing easier movements like\nmedicine ball throws or kettlebell\nswings or something you could do those\nquite often as long as the volume is is\nstaying pretty low\nlast little piece here is progression\nhow do I progress over time\nso I mentioned this earlier but just\nwant to fill this Gap right back in\nbefore we head over to hypertree which\nis three to five percent increase per\nweek of intensity in general and you can\ndo upwards of about five percent\nincrease in volume per week over time\nand I generally recommend running that\nfor at longest eight weeks\nbut probably most realistically you want\nto go about five weeks or so and then\nhave some sort of a deload or back off\nweek if you do that you're generally\ngoing to be a pretty good spot so those\nare like the Core Concepts now\nthere's a whole bunch of fun methods you\ncan play with within all these\ncategories and I I would like to\nactually cover just a couple of them\num if we've got a little more space for\nthat sure I'd love to hear about those\nI'd like to also just cue up one which\nis well I joked about people texting and\ndoing social media between sets and I\nthat's not a joke well I confess I\nstopped bringing my phone into the gym\nbecause of the urge to you know take my\nmind off of the workout and I just\nstarted enjoying my workouts a lot more\nyeah and the workouts go far better that\nway and they're just much more efficient\nit for me I realize that some people\ntheir careers take place in the gym and\nso for the I don't\num look down upon anyone using their\nphone at the gym but that really tends\nto help me but I do wonder whether or\nnot there's an optimal Behavior or\nmindset in between sets I've heard\nbefore that pacing around can actually\nhelp diffuse some of the lactate and\nother metabolic byproducts of of work\nand exertion yeah that can lead to\nbetter performance I've also heard that\num you know shaking the muscles out I\nmean there's all sorts of gym lore\num about this but maybe there's also\nsome decent science I'm just curious uh\nif you have any specific recommendations\nthat people could play with or try yep\nso for for Speed and Power\nyou want to walk this balance of stiff\nbut fresh\nand so if you were to literally finish a\nrepetition sit on a bench for five\nminutes you would stand up after that\nfairly stiff and you wouldn't feel sort\nof smooth this is all\nso this is an all-known science this is\nall\npractical application right data\nanecdata there you go strength is a\nlittle bit different but it's the same\nconcept you're walking that line in\ngeneral a lot of the times if you see\nPower lifters and weightlifters in\nbetween sets they're going to sit down\nand not move for hypertrophy can be a\nlittle bit different because you're\ngetting towards fatigue and so the\nfactors you mentioned like clearing\nlactate well first of all lactate is not\nactually causing fatigue that's that's a\ngiant myth that will which is why I teed\nit up no I'm just kidding\num but in the case of again speed power\nyou're not going to fatigue so fatigue\nManagement's not really an issue you\nwant to make sure that you're getting\ncomplete neurological recovery which is\na little bit slower than muscle\nenergetically you're not out of any gas\nwhatsoever right um You are not a lack\nof fuel\nyou know doing three repetitions of a\nvertical jump yep no plenty of glycogen\ntotally what about stretching between\nsets yeah you probably don't want to do\nthat either there are very clear\nexamples of pre-exercise stretching\nstatic stretching being quite\ndetrimental for maximum power production\nthe same thing for speed and strength\nand that's been shown actually a number\nof times in a number of Laboratories\nwhich is like a a classic Hallmark any\nscientist looks for of like really\njumping on board with an idea if it's\nshown not only multiple times but in\nmultiple Laboratories for multiple\nscientists and they're all seeing the\nsame thing you start to get a lot of\nconfidence that that's a real finding\nand that's been shown we've done that in\nour Center for sport performance not\nmyself but one of my colleagues has done\na lot of stretching research and he's\nseen that a lot on everything from\nvertical jump to ISO kinetic\ndynamometers and enforce velocity curves\nand there's we've seen this as printing\nwe've seen this in speed we've seen this\nin loaded stuff so you don't want to\nspend a ton of time stretching\nstatically stretching a muscle\npriority if you do that and you have to\ndo that say say for example you finish\nthat you're just like feeling really\ntight yeah go ahead like you need to get\nin the right position especially for\nmost people where are you willing to\nsacrifice 10 of power to make sure you\ndon't get hurt yes that answer is almost\nalways yes outside of some very specific\nathlete scenarios so if you're not in\nthe right position I actually remember\nhaving this conversation with Kelly uh\nKelly started a long time ago it was\njust like yeah fine I'll lose five\npercent if that means I'm not going to\nget in a bad position and\nhurt my back and I totally totally agree\nso if you got to open up a hip or an\nankle or something to get there get in\nthe right position number one we'll live\nwith the five percent reduction in power\nand if you do just reactivate\nso before you go do your working set go\ndo something fast again a vertical jump\na short Sprint acceleration and sort of\nget that system cleared back up\num if you didn't stretch it for long\nenough and you didn't hold it for long\nenough you should be able to be just\nfine so when it comes to hypertrophy now\nyou can really stretch all you want\nbecause we're not it's not driven by\nintensity or outcome it's being driven\nby an insult into the tissue and so if\nyou're pre-fatigue for hypertrophy it\ndoesn't matter if you're pre-stretched\nthat doesn't matter we're not going for\nquality of outcome we're going for\nquality of internal signal which is not\ngoing to be changed by your Force output\nso it doesn't really matter\nyou mentioned a few other things that\none might consider in light of uh the\nlist that you provided of choice order\nvolume frequency and progression right\nso starting off with power I just wanted\nto hand\nthe The Listener issue with a whole\nbunch of different methods to go play\nwith right so as long as you get those\nConcepts the repetition range for power\n30 to 70 percent of your one repetition\nMax depending on the exercise and your\ntraining status\num you're going to get the power as long\nas you're attempting to go fast it's\ngonna be great a lot of things you can\ntry applyometrics are a great example of\nthings that are effective for\num for power development we've mentioned\nmedicine ball throws\nshort Sprints you can even do Sprints uh\nunlike an air bike which is a great\nsuper safe activity you can do them from\nLike a Rolling start where you kind of\nlike get going a little bit and then you\nexplode for five seconds and see how\nfast you can get or a dead start like\nboth of those are very very acceptable\nweight lifting movements so snatches and\ncleaning jerks are tremendously\neffective in fact they are pound for\npound by far the most effective exercise\nchoice for power development like\nwithout question so those are good ones\nclapping push-ups speed squats these are\nall a whole host of different things\nthat you can do for Speed and power\ndevelopment I'm depending on your\nkettlebell swings another great one all\nthese can be done depending on your\npreference exercise availability what's\nat your gym or not gym any of those\nthings\nif somebody is more focused on strength\nas opposed to power\nwhat are the additional variables they\nshould consider again within the context\nof this overarching theme of choice\norder volume frequency and progression\nabsolutely it's almost identical with a\ncouple of small exceptions number one\nyou probably can't do as many working\nsets\nper week for strength because now you're\nintroducing a heavier load and that's\ngoing to represent some sort of fatigue\nload on the tissue all those things so\nyou could probably get away with doing\n20 sets of two\nof a vertical jump\nfour or five times a week you probably\ncouldn't do that at a 90 on squat right\nso the total amount of sets and the\ntotal amount of weekly load you can get\nto just needs to be lower and then the\nintensity right so we talked about that\nneeds to be generally higher than 70\nyeah with you know some portion of that\nbeing working sets at some point so that\nreally truly being at 90 plus everything\nelse is pretty identical you still want\nto emphasize maximum speed despite the\nfact you may actually not be moving\nfaster because you've introduced load\nyou still need to be attempting that but\nyou're going to be picking complex\nexercises you're generally going to be\nhedging more towards\nbarbells and machines so this is a case\nwhere bodyweight training can be\neffective again particularly for the\nupper body but at some point you're\nreally going to have to move past that\nbecause there's just a certain amount of\nload you can't put on the lower body\nwith just your body weight you get\nlimited by how much you weigh or I mean\nthere's a couple of things you can do\nbut you're going to run out past that\npretty quickly and so in when it comes\nto strength they tend to be less\nathletic movements because you know we\nhave to have a barbell on us we have to\nhave a we have to be on a machine or\nsomething like that and so that's a\nsubtle difference in exercise choice we\nneed to also be careful about The\nEccentric portion and things like that\nwe don't have as much risk in like a\nspeeder power one so um some of the\ndifferent things you can play with there\nwe've talked about doing things like\npushes and pulls I also love carries so\na farmer's carry pushing a sled dragging\na sled all kinds of things a yoke walk\nall kinds of carry modalities that are\nvery very effective for strength um\nthere's eccentric overload\ntraining which we really haven't gone\ninto but it's a really Advanced\ntechnique where you can actually load at\ngreater than 100 percent\nof your one repetition Max but you're\nonly going to do The Eccentric portion\nof it so physiologically you are much\nstronger eccentrically than you are\nconcentrically for a variety of of\nmuscle tissue reasons actually and so\nimagine if you can do a bench press at\n200 pounds and what you might actually\ndo is load it to 220 and you would have\na spotter and maybe even use it in a\nrack and you would lower it Down Under\nControl all the way to the bottom and\nthen stop\nyour friends would lift it back up the\ntop and you just practice that eccentric\nportion you would actually be able to\nlower say 220 pounds effectively despite\nthe fact that you wouldn't have been\nable to lift it back up you don't need\nto start there but that is a very\neffective method for increase in fact\narguing one of my um one of my doctoral\nstudents right now is doing a project on\nthis at USC\nand he uh like he's focusing directly on\nthis and it's it's quite clear this\noftentimes more effective at strength\ndevelopment than anything else because\nyou can actually just like in the speed\nexample where you want to actually\npractice moving faster so instead of\npracticing 100 of you on our Max for\nstrength you actually practice that\nhigher than that to get better at it so\nthat's that's another much more advanced\ntool\nplease don't let me get sued by saying\nall that like folks be careful make sure\nyou're doing the proper exercise in your\npositioning and like caveat caveat\ncaveat okay\num but outside of that it can be it's\ntotally fine and safe yeah with it when\npeople get injured they can't train you\ncan't train you don't progress you lose\nprogress so uh certainly that's worth\nhighlighting so two more\num a little more advanced techniques\nthat I want to throw out there and one\nof them is called cluster sets so\ncluster sets are there's a bunch of ways\nto do it but imagine taking a mini break\nin between every single repetition\nso say you're going to do five\nrepetitions yeah in a row what you're\nactually going to do is do one\nrepetition\nset it down pause for five to ten\nseconds\nand then do the next one\npause do the next one pause pause pause\npause pause so you can imagine doing\nlike a squat and you're gonna go down\nexplode up and you're standing you're\ngoing to Rack it out\nyou're gonna kind of like shake back out\ncatch your breath\nwalk back in do another one\nrock it out and you can repeat that\nuntil you've executed your three or four\nor five repetitions and then you take\nyour three to five minute break before\nyour next step\nthat is an incredibly effective way for\nboth strength power and actually even\nhypertrophy because you can keep the\nquality the force output the power\noutput very very very high because\nyou're getting these little mini breaks\nand you're not getting fatigue setting\nin by the time you're say third or\nfourth or fifth repetition in that set\nafter repetition one\nyou start to see very small subtle\nreductions power up but because you\nstart to see a little bit of fatigue you\nyou take those five to ten seconds off\neven up to 20 seconds you can actually\ndo it you don't see any drop and enforce\noutput over the course of the five and\nso what you really have done is you've\ngotten five in this example\nfirst repetitions which is the way we\nwill kind of say it right so all five of\nthose have the same quality as rep\nnumber one which is again as we're\ntalking that's the driver and strength\nand so that's the one we want to\npreserve so it takes a little bit longer\nfor some exercises it's not very good\nit's great for like a deadlift because\nyou set it back down check it back out\nre-grip hard to do with the bench you\ngot to re-rack it back in then re-rack\nit back out that's like kind of a pain\nin the ass so there's some exercises\nthat doesn't work well with and some\nthat it does but cluster sets and a lot\nof research on those\num very effective would you recommend if\nsomebody's doing cluster sets that they\ndo them for every session within that\nweek or just this is an occasional thing\nyou could do it this could be your\ntraining strategy yeah absolutely so you\ncan really take it that seriously um in\nfact like if you look at again the\nweight lifters\nthey will do cluster sets by default not\neven trying still say they'll do like a\nclean and then they'll drop the weight\nback out they're supposed to be doing\nsay a set of three but almost always\nthey're gonna like shake it out re-grip\nand then pull it again and sometimes\nthey're set of three takes like a minute\nand then like you hear it's funny\nbecause it's like like a I set a triple\nPR you're like no you did three singles\nlike what's the difference between doing\nthree singles and a set of three when\nyou took a minute between each rep\num I love that community so\nyeah I mean it could be your strategy\nlike it could be like hey for this\nfive-week block this is all my training\nespecially for your compound movements\nif you're gonna go to start doing some\nof the smaller movements Maybe\nyou give up on that um it could also\njust be something you do for your one\nprimary exercise for the day\nso do that thing that is the most\nimportant first and just do it for that\none and then the rest of them you can\nkind of ditch it if you need to save a\nlittle bit of that time it can also be\nsomething you do by feel\nso you know you're two reps in and you\ngo God like I'm not feeling like poppy\nhere like re-rack it catch my breath for\na quick second and do it so it doesn't\nhave to be ultra planned I guess what\nI'm doing is is I'm giving you an excuse\nto make sure you're super fresh for\nevery rep it matters the last one I want\nto talk about here\nis what's called Dynamic variable\nresistance so Dynamic variable\nresistance is uh fixing the problem we\nhave with What's called the human\nstrength curve so theory of constraints\nagain you're only as strong as you are\nin your weakest point of the movement so\ndepending on the the movement you do\nthis happens at a different range of\nmotion well the deadlift has used this\nexample it's also because we've done\nlike research in my lab using this stuff\non the deadlift so I can speak to it\nvery directly when you go to pull it off\nthe ground some people are going to fail\nright at the bottom meaning they won't\nget the weight off the ground at all\nsome people will feel just below the\nknees that's likely kind of like the\nhardest transition period and then some\npeople will feel right at the top just\nbefore they can lock out okay great so\nwhat that means is at some point of that\nlift\nyou're going to only be limited by your\nstrength in the weakest area\nall right\nso if you have a constant load on the\nbar in those other two parts of the\nrange of motion where you are not the\nweakest\nthey are never truly being tested for\ntheir maximum strength because they're\nalways being limited by the previous one\nand this is the same argument that we\nwould get into if people ask about\nshould I what do you think about using\nstraps\nright strapping your hand to a bar for\ndeadlift things like that there's pros\nand cons here there are times when you\nwant to use a strap and there are times\nwhen it's a bad idea so what dynamic\nvariable resistance is is either using\nthings like a heavy band or or chains on\nthe bar if you've ever seen people do\nthat so in my lab we actually have a\nforce plate on the ground and then we\nhave built-in basically hooks in the\nfront and back so we can actually set a\nbarbell on top of the force plate where\nyou stand on it and then run bands from\nthe back to the front running over top\nof the weights and so when you stand up\nas you're going up vertically the bands\nare getting Tighter and Tighter and\npulling the weight towards the ground so\nthe weight is getting heavier and\nheavier as you stand up\nso as you start to gain mechanical\nadvantage in your positioning you start\nto increase load because the bands are\ngetting Tighter and Tighter and Tighter\nso this allows you to train that full\npart of the strength curve and to\nchallenge your stronger areas with\nheavier weight and your weaker areas\nwith lower weight you can do the same\nthing with a bench press you can do it\nwith a squat and any other exercise\nvariation and dynamic variable\nresistance is incredibly effective\nfor a number of things you're going to\ngive up a little bit\nbecause the total load you can put on\nthe barbell is lower because you're\ngoing to be adding you know in large\ncases several hundred pounds of band\ntension and so it pros and cons\nso it's always a game it changes the\ncurve but it's it's a very good\ntechnique\num that that people is fairly easy to\nimplement it's fun in fact if you try\nthis on on a bench or a squat you're\ngonna be the first time you give it a go\nyou're like oh my God because the bands\nare pulling you all over the place\num so you have to get very stable very\nquick\num been shown a number of times a\nhandful of studies out of many\nLaboratories to be a very effective\ntraining technique a little bit more\nadvanced but I want to throw that in\nthere for the folks that are maybe just\ntired of sort of doing the same barbells\nand doubles and machines and you want to\ntry something different a very effective\ntechnique sounds like fun yeah it's\ngreat with your permission I'm going to\nread back my summary list of training\nfor power and training for strength\naccording to your description and you\ncan tell me where I'm right and where\nI'm wrong\nI'm going to pick three to five\nexercises and these should be compound\nexercises so multi-joint movements\nI'm going to perform those exercises for\nthree to five repetitions each\nI'm going to do three to five movements\ntotal per workout\nand I'm going to rest three to five\nminutes between sets\nokay if I'm training for power\nthe weight loads on the work set so not\nthe warm-up sets but the work sets are\ngoing to fall somewhere in the range of\n30 to 70 percent of my one repetition\nmaximum yep and the larger the movement\nthe higher that number goes so on a\nsquat you're okay getting 50 or 60 on a\nbench you would not want to go that high\nyou would want to stay close enough 30\nto 40 range so the way you scale that up\nand down is dependent upon the\ndifficulty of the movement great\nif training for strength I'm going to\nhave my work sets be\n70 or more of my one repetition maximum\nyep and the only thing to add there is\nin the case of actually all of them\num it's okay to go less than three reps\nper set so a single or a double one or\ntwo represent is also fantastic so uh we\nuse three to five as the concept but\nless is okay going more than that is\ngenerally not a good idea so less is\nokay more is generally not okay and then\nyou listed off a number of really\nvaluable I don't even want to call them\nfine points but important points to keep\nin mind within each and both of these\nprograms one that really stands out in\nmy mind\nis this idea of\nif I perform this three by five program\nbut I'm also including some hypertrophy\nwork for arms or calves or muscle groups\nthat might not be hit as directly\nas one might like during the three by\nfive component that's okay but do that\nafter the three by five Training and\nkeep in mind that that additional work\ncan potentially compromise recovery for\nthe three by five power promoting or\nstrength promoting program the example\nbeing for instance if one does arm work\non the first workout of the week or even\nthe you know the third workout of the\nweek or the fifth workout of the week\nand that arm work is higher repetition\nhypertrophy directed work it's\nreasonable to assume that it might\nimpede some of the three by five power\npromoting or strength promoting training\nin the subsequent workout so just to be\nmindful of that and perhaps throttle\nback on the intensity or the volume or\nif my goal is strictly power or strictly\nstrength probably best to leave out\nother forms of training yep love it one\nlast little thing I don't think we did\nJustice is intention\nand the reason I want to go back to this\nnow is because\nwe've talked a lot about specific loads\nyou have to hit\nand that's generally the case but if\nintention is there you can fudge those\nnumbers in terms of how much load goes\non the bar in fact you can get as low as\nno load on the bar a great example here\nis like a plank exercise so you can do a\nplank in which you get in a position and\nyou simply contract the least amount\nnecessary to hold the position\nalso you could contract as hard as\npossible pulling your scapula down and\nback squeezing your core squeezing your\nquads squeezing your glutes that is\nactually going to still help strength\nproduction because you're attempting to\ncontract very very hard even though\nquote unquote the load is the same\nthat thing extends to weight on the bar\nso you could theoretically see large\nimprovements in strength at 50 of your\n100 max if you're Contracting as hard as\npossible and so there's a lot lots and\nlots of different ways you can train for\nstrength that are outside of this weight\nlifting weight training spectrum and you\nknow if people if you hear things like\nthis and you're like wow I know I read\nthis book or I saw this other coach who\nyou know like I got so much stronger\nthat way well if intention is there\nthose are absolutely possible\nthis could be anything from bodyweight\nstyle of training it could be very low\nload Implement stuff so a kettlebell a\nlight kettlebell or a ball it could be\nsingle leg training it's like all kinds\nof different methods they will only work\nfor strength though\nwhen you're past your first you know\nhandful of months of training if\nintention is there and if it is then\nthese specific numbers and protocols\ndon't matter as much so don't get too\ncaught up in them if you're not worrying\nabout exercise quality and this is very\nvery important because you mentioned\nearlier about how you stop taking your\nphone into the gym with you one of our\nformer students Ramsay ninja is uh the\nhead strength Edition coach at the\nUniversity of Kansas and he made he made\na great post a couple of days ago where\nhe gave sort of a tip of how do I\nimprove training quality and one of his\ntips is set your playlist before you go\nto the gym and the reason is people send\nspend so much time in between sets just\nfinding the next song that they like it\nmakes their workout so long and so\nunproductive so that is one strategy or\ndo what you do which is Ditch the music\nentirely when you don't have music or a\nphone to look at\nyou only have one job you only have one\nthing to pay attention to and what\nyou'll find is the quality of the\ntraining will go up exponentially you\nwill feel kind of quote unquote bored\nbut that's just means you'll go back to\ntraining and you'll get a lot more done\nbecause you have one thing to focus on\nso you can get a lot more done when you\navoid those distractions and when you're\ndoing strength and especially power work\nsince it's not fatiguing strength will\nbe a little bit but Power won't be p get\nvery bored they're used to either\nfeeling a pump or a burn or a sweat or\nand that's their like perception of my\nquality of workout\nthese exercises will not hit that for\nyou so there has to be another metric\nyou're looking at which is I'm going to\ntry to move as well as I can as hard as\nI can that's going to produce your\nresults if you can't do that then you\nmight as well just not do these workouts\ngo do something else you're just going\nto be wasting time you're going to be\nburning a very low amount of calories\nyou'll have wasted an hour and you're\ngoing to go right back to the place you\nwere so be very intentional\nthere are actually some some studies\nshowing that music can enhance\nperformance we've done some of these in\nour lab so what's that mean it's not\nabout the music per se it's about the\nfocus and intent and do whatever it\ntakes to be very focused and intent and\nyou can actually get in and out very\nquickly and get a lot of work done and\nsee a lot of results\nlove it okay let's talk about\nhypertrophy\na topic that occupies the minds of so\nmany youth young men but also a lot of\nwomen I think one of the really\ninteresting progressions that's taken\nplace in the last decade or so is that\nfar more men and women are using\nresistance training in order to evoke\nhypertrophy growth of muscles for\naesthetic reasons and for all sorts of\nreasons\nwhat are the ways that people can induce\nhypertrophy so not to correct you or\ninsult you but probably a better way to\nthink about that question is really what\nstimuli do I need to give the muscle to\ninduce hypertrophy now there are\nhormonal factors that are important\nthere are nutritional factors but just\nto stick with the context of training\nthis is really going to frame a lot of\nour answers and as you'll see it's one\nof the reasons why I call hypertrude\ntraining kind of idiot proof in terms of\nprogramming now the work is hard\ndifficult and all that but the Precision\nneeded is a lot less than what we saw in\npower and strength and so if you note\nthere like it's very important that you\ndo it in this style with this intent and\nwith with these Within These parameters\nand if you're outside the parameters\nit's not going to be it hypertrophy has\na very broad range in terms of your\nactual applications and this is why you\nhave and will continue to see countless\nstyles of training that all work I mean\nI know you were mentored earlier in life\nby one of my favorite people in this\nentire field Mike menser like just an\nabsolute character his style was\ncompletely different than what you would\nsee in a classic textbook\nor any number of different influencers\nor coaches or individuals and if you've\never thought thought to yourself like\nwhy is it all these programs work and\npeople love to jump to things like well\nthat's the steroids like just get that\nout of the equation for now\nindependent of that right that's not\neven part of the equation you're still\ngoing to see results and the question is\nlike why well that's because what's\ndriving changes in strength and Power\nare the adaptations of specificity\nwhat's driving changes in hypertrophy is\nmuch more well-rounded and so you have\noptions to get there remember you're\ntraining a movement and now you're\ntraining a response and a muscle that\ncaused the growth that's very very\ndifferent\nso if we look at like the classic Dogma\nwe have to basically challenge the\nmuscle to need to come back in this case\nspecifically bigger and the nutrients\nneed to be there to support that growth\nokay the nutrients aside perhaps we can\ncome and a few more minutes and talk\nabout that\nso all we really have to do is going\nback to our our dogma of activation of\nsomething on the cell wall we've talked\nabout this earlier that's got to induce\nthat signaling Cascade that's got to be\nstrong enough to cause the nucleus to\nreact to it to go to the ribosomes to\ninitiate this entire Cascade of protein\nsynthesis okay so that signal has to be\none of a couple of things either has to\nbe strong enough\none time it has to be frequent enough\nor it has to be a combination of these\nthings\nall right so I can get there with a lot\nof frequency and a moderate signal I can\nget there with very low frequency and a\nlarge signal like more akin to what you\ndid with Mike back in the day I'm sure\nand still trained that way still\ntraining each muscle group mainly once a\nweek directly and once a week indirectly\nso all you can all you have to do there\nto not fail is to make sure the training\nis hard enough\nand it's going to work if you choose the\nfrequency path then you actually have to\nmake sure you're not training too hard\nto where you can actually maintain the\nfrequency the only wrong combination\nhere is infrequent and low intensity and\nlow volume that's it as long as one of\nthose three variables is high you're\ngoing to get there because the\nmechanisms that are needed to activate\nthat signaling Cascade are wide ranging\nand this is why when we even see things\nlike Blood Flow Restriction Training\nright this is when you put like a cuff\non your arm or your leg and you block\nblood flow and you use no load or as low\nas say 30 of your maximum and you take\nit to fatigue failure that actually is\nan equally effective way of inducing\nhypertrophy despite the fact that you\nknow you're using three five ten maybe\nmost 20 to 30 percent of your owner at\nMax why because you went through the\nroute of metabolic disturbance okay\nother ways say a higher load maybe as\nheavy as you can for say eight\nrepetitions is going to get through\nwhat's called mechanical tension and so\nthere's there's these different paths\nthat we can get to the same spot now\neventually these things have a\nsaturation point so you don't need all\nthree of these mechanisms the third one\nof course being muscle damage or\nbreakdown\nand I and I know we want to chat a\nlittle bit about that but none of these\nthree are absolutely required you can\nhave multiple of them in a session\num you don't have to have breakdown at\nall that is a complete uh well really\nit's a flat out lie that you have to\nbreak a muscle down\nto cause it to grow that's just not\nneeded at all you have to have one of\nthese three things though and so again\nthis allows you a lot of flexibility\nwhich is why crafting your program which\nis best for you\nis actually fairly simple when it comes\nto hypertrophy you just have to make\nsure you do the work and you want to\nmake sure you have a few standards in\nplace with the exercise choice and some\nother things that will\num we'll hit in just a second but that's\nreally the fundamental way of getting to\nit making sure either that signal is\nloud enough\nor frequent enough to give\nthe nuclei a convincing enough reason to\nspend the resources because you have to\nremember two things in order to grow new\nskeletal muscle you need amino acids\nwhich are your supply and then you need\nprimarily carbohydrates as the energy\nsource to power that synthesis process\nso you remember basic chemistry that\nsays if you're going to take two atoms\nand you're going to pull them apart or\nput them together right that's going to\ntake energy typically and in most of\nactually metabolism\nuh when you split a bond you're going to\nget it's called exergonic you're going\nto get energy from that but when you put\nthem together\nthat's going to take energy this is why\nwe call that protein synthesis right so\nyou have to convince your nucleus that\none invest those resources in energy\nprimarily carbohydrate but number two\nand more importantly invest that Supply\nthere's a ton of possible ways to get\nenergy but there's a very low amount of\namino acids available and you need them\nfor many more things than just taking\nyour biceps from 17 inches to 18 inches\nright it's not going to do that if\nyou're in a position where again you\ncan't sustain an immune function if red\nblood cell turnover needs to be higher\nor any of the other main like tons of\nthings that you need proteins for so you\nhave to be able to say like are you sure\nyou really want to spend these resources\nand build it in a muscle because once we\ndo that it's very difficult to go\nbackwards break them back down and bring\nthe amino acids back into the to that\navailability pool so we can use them for\neither another function entirely or even\nanother muscle group that's called\nprotein redistribution by the way when\nyou say maybe you don't do\num a lot of upper body work in your\ntraining and you're not eating enough\nprotein or a minimal amount and you're\ndoing a lot of lifting in your legs\nyou'll you'll notice your legs will get\nlarger but that's actually a lot of\ntimes you're pulling the protein from\nsay your upper body in this case and\nredistributing it back down\num to the quads so that's the way you\nthat's what you have to get to and in\nterms of application what numbers to hit\nwe can go through each one of our\nmodifiable variables just like we did\nwith speed and strength and power and\nwalk through some of our best practices\nin each category yes so I'd love to talk\nabout those modifiable variables as they\nrelate to\nchoice\nof movements order of movements\nvolume so sets and repetitions and\nfrequency of training and I'm\nparticularly interested in frequency of\ntraining because that relates to the\nso-called split where\ntypically one is not training their\nwhole body every workout although there\nare I'm sure hypertrophy workouts that\num our whole body workouts but where\npeople are dividing on their body parts\non onto different days\nso uh\nwould love to go through this list one\nby one starting with exercise Choice\ncool great so in the previous section we\npretty much said exclusively choose your\nexercises by the movement patterns and\nyou want to balance between pushing and\npulling and rotation and things like\nthat in this particular case you have\nthe option to do either here's my\nrecommendation most people default\nalmost exclusively to Choosing by body\nparts here right I'm going to do calves\nand shoulders today and chest and back\nwhatever combinations of things they\nwant that is clearly effective strategy\nhowever many Studies have actually been\ndone where you choose by movement\npatterns and that is actually equally\neffective\nnow one little caveat I actually should\nhave said a few minutes ago when we talk\nabout the research on muscle hypertrophy\nit is important to distinguish the fact\nthat the vast majority of This research\nis coming from a novice to moderately\ntrained individuals there's actually\nmore and more research coming out on\ntrained individuals but that's still\nmoderately trained right even those ones\nso what happens in those people that are\nactually way past that point we don't\nknow scientifically it's very difficult\nto do research there so that's an\nimportant caveat I will acknowledge when\nI say hey you don't need to do this or\nyou have to do this you're assuming a\ntraining status of moderate to low may\nor may not be true past that we don't\nknow scientifically I have certain\nthoughts personally but the science will\nonly take us that far so\nthat being said you can actually choose\nby muscle or by movement pattern here\nwhichever is is your personal preference\nand this is actually where you can act\njust become a good coach whether you're\ncoaching somebody else through this\nfitness journey or it's yourself and\ngive them a little bit of autonomy so\nmaybe you select the first three\nexercises and then let them select one\nevery day and so if they especially want\nto make sure that one muscle group grows\nlet them Target that muscle and maybe\nthe rest of the day you've actually\nsplit it up as Push Pull or something\nelse like that all those strategies are\neffective personal preference as long as\nthe total amount of volume on the\nworking muscle is equated throughout the\nweek which we'll get to those numbers in\na second then you're going to be in the\nexact same spot no problem I would\nactually generally encourage\npeople to choose exercises in a variety\nof Fashions I actually think that it's\nimportant that you do some number of\ncombination of what we call bilateral\nand unilateral exercises so bilateral\nbeing think about it like a squat where\nbi meaning two lateral you have two feet\non the ground moving in sequence here\nunilateral is one so this could be\nsomething as simple as a rear foot a\nlimited split squat it could be a single\nleg leg press or single leg curl it\ncould be a pistol squat something where\nthe the individual limb is moving one at\na time you need to have a combination of\nbilateral and unilateral trading that's\ngood to do for strength as well probably\nnot super important for power but I'm\nalso very important for making sure\nfor hypertrophy's sake you're not\ngetting any imbalances\nas you progress especially through\nmonths and years of training so make\nsure you're doing a little bit of a\ncombination whether you want to pick\nspecific implements that's really a\nmethods question and a preference\nquestion then it is Concepts so dumbbell\ngreat kettlebell fine barbell awesome\nband doesn't matter body weight none of\nthese things are as important because\nall you're trying to do is create a\ncertain insult in the tissue and the\nImplement is just whichever one you feel\nbest doing it and this is where actually\nmachines come into play a lot machines\nare greatly underappreciated they are a\nfantastic resource especially somebody\nwho's either early in their fitness\njourney\nor somebody who really is having a hard\ntime targeting a muscle group with a\nbigger compound movement\nso when you're choosing exercises for\nhypertrophy you're going to want to\nstart with those bigger compound\nmovements that's going to be drive a lot\nof the adaptation you can get to these\nsingle joint movements like a little bit\nlater but having said that\nbecause of of the way that people move\ndifferently their bomb or their\nanthropometrics and their biomechanics\nand even their technique the same exact\nexercise\nwill not necessarily work the same exact\nmuscle groups for multiple people so if\nyou and I both went and did a back squat\num if you did a little bit more of what\nwe call a high bar squat so this is the\nbar is literally sitting up higher up on\nyour neck you're keeping your back more\nvertical and because in order to do that\nyou shift your knees much further past\nyour toes keeping of course your whole\nfoot on the ground in good position okay\nthat's going to generally put more of an\nemphasis on the knee joint right and so\nthat's not a bad thing you tend to see a\nlittle bit more work in the quads there\na little bit less work in the spinal\nrectus and back because you're actually\nnot supporting the weight horizontally\nwhich is a diff it's a much more\ndifficult position it's vertically\nstacked okay\nif I were doing the classic low bar\nsquat which is again lowering the bar\ndown my further down my back towards uh\none more like my shoulder blades I\nprobably take a little bit of a wider\nstance and when I squat I drive my\nglutes back further away from the\nmidline in as in fact as a general rule\nif you take the midline of your body the\nthing that moves is the farthest away\nfrom that midline is likely to be the\nthing that's activating the most\nso in the case of the of the front squat\nyou're not generally going to be using\nyour glutes as much if you're in that\nare not even front side just that high\nbar squat where you're very very\nvertical your knees are going to be\nmoving very far over your toes which is\nfantastic therefore it's a little bit\nmore knee dominant as can we say it the\nother version here you can keep your\nshins really close to Vertical you move\nyour butt backwards\nyou're going to have to then lean\nforward with your torso which means\nit'll be more low back more glutes and a\nlittle bit less knee now that's a\ngeneral statement it's not necessarily\nalways true but as a guideline there\nthat is one exact exercise where you may\nbe going man I'm trying to improve this\nclear weakness I have in my quads I\ncan't even leg extension my body weight\nI have a significant problem there so\nmaybe in your particular case if I'm\nhammering you or you're hammering\nyourself in a squad exercise and you're\nwondering why your quads aren't getting\nany stronger or growing in any size it\nmay be because of the style of the\nmovement so I may need to go Andrew all\nright look squats in general if you look\nat the research are an excellent\nexercise for Quad development but for\nyou they're not because of the way you\nstand or just because of you know neural\nactivation it doesn't matter so I need\nto take you to a machine and isolate\nthat muscle group so we can make sure we\nsee development in that so if you're\ntrying to grow a specific body part area\nindividual muscle it's very important\nthat you're actually seeing progress\nthere and don't worry about well in the\ntextbook the bench press is supposed to\nbe good for your PEC because if you're\nnot actually moving the right position\nor depends on the angle in which your\nsternum actually sits in your body a\nbench press may actually be doing very\nlittle for your PEC and you may need to\nadjust to say an incline bench or a\ndecline bench or a PEC fly so machines\ncan be fantastic at letting you isolate\nwithout having to worry about things\nlike stability your low back position\ngetting hurt where's your neck at you\ncan really concentrate on just the\nmovement concentrate on the muscle and\nlet everything else kind of go away and\nensure you're getting training in that\nspecific area those are excellent\nrecommendations one thing I want to ask\nabout is prioritizing specific body\nparts and therefore specific exercises\nand here I'm not necessarily referring\nto trying to bring up a so-called weak\nbody part you know an area that tends to\nbe either genetically deficient because\nin some cases I learned for instance\nhaving seen a lot of competitive track\nand field championships I love watching\ntrack and field as a spectator up to\nHayward Field in Oregon whenever there's\na meat oh sure I really love that the\nsprinters are amazing\num they have some of the highest calves\nin the world that I've ever seen I mean\nlike little like little micro Cavs but\nthey're fast as hell they're right\nbehind the knee and they have a very\nlong distance between that calf and\ntheir foot which makes it propulsion\nexcellent right they wouldn't stand a\nchance as a competitive bodybuilder but\nbecause something different is being\nselected for in bodybuilding but\nobviously they're they're magnificent\nfor sprinting most people of course\nreside somewhere between the extreme of\nyou know very long muscle bellies from\nyou know origin to insertion or very\nvery short muscles usually people have\none or two body parts parts that they\nwant to emphasize for whatever reason\nyou know these days it seems to be\npeople are really what are they saying\nnow like glutes to the new biceps or\nbiceps are the new glutes or I don't\nknow anyway you see this stuff I love\nthem by the way I am so Pro curls in the\nsquat rack there you go love it right\nthere you go so nobody kill me so\neveryone has their thing but the that\nthey would like to emphasize but I have\na question because we're specifically\ntalking about hypertrophy which is\nshould people give themselves permission\nto not train a body part if their goal\nis balanced hypertrophy I'll give a\ncouple of examples one of the reasons\nwhy I for instance not done a lot of\nfree weight squatting is because despite\nmy quadriceps being rather weak\naccording to you\num they tend to grow rather easily\nrelative to other muscle groups and the\ngoal for me has always been balanced\ndevelopment yeah and so I emphasize\nhamstring work and I emphasize a you\nknow calf work and hamstring work\num it's not that I don't train my quads\nat all but I do far less for them and I\navoid the big compound movements for\nthem I I occasionally do them and what\nagain this is not about what I do or\ndon't do but I think that in the context\nof a conversation about hypertrophy is\nit appropriate to give people permission\nto say listen if you're just genetically\nyou know strong large lats\ndoing a lot of chin-ups and rows might\nactually be the worst thing for you if\nyour goal is balanced development and I\num I ask because I don't often hear\nanyone any you know credentialed people\ngive people permission to completely\navoid training a given body part if\ntheir goal is balanced development and\nyet I think most people who are\nresistance training are seeking balance\ndevelopment I don't know anybody that\nactively wants to have big upper body\nsmall legs I think that comes from\nneglect and laziness in most cases\nsometimes injury related or other things\nbut\num I think this is an important point to\nraise that any good program for\nhypertrophy I would think would have to\ntake into account people's genetic and\nnatural variation\num sport based variation in which muscle\ngroups just tend to grow easily for them\nand which ones require a lot more focus\nand work yeah absolutely you first of\nall you have permission to do or not do\nanything you'd like to do in terms of of\nhybrid tree I generally wouldn't not\nrecommend disregarding a muscle group\nentirely I know that's not what you\nactually suggested but just to make sure\nthat people didn't hear it that way\num what I would do is in this example is\nI would continue to do those big\nmovements I would just keep the volume\nlow so I might do two sets or something\nuh twice a week there's a whole bunch of\nreasons you want to make sure that those\nmotor patterns are there you want to\nmake sure that the the especially the\nbenefit of these compound movements is\nyou get to work so many complementary\nmuscle movements at the same time so in\nthe case of like loaded squat you're not\nonly working stability in the hip as\nwell as the knee but you're also working\nupper body uh your your rhomboids are\nkeeping you in position your neck has to\nstay in position your toes everything is\nworking and so it's really difficult to\nget those things when you take that\nmovement out and you replace it with say\na a machine hamstring curl that whole\nelement of balance and neurological\ncontrol is very very important to\nmaintain over time and that just gets\nremoved with if you go to machines only\nso I would keep some of those things in\nmaybe even not all year round but maybe\none quarter of the year two quarters\nevery other rotate it something like\nthat as long as it's getting you're not\nif the reason you weren't doing say\nthose squats was uh because you're like\nah it hurts my backers okay great then\nleave it out but if it's just simple you\ndon't want your quads to go too much I\nwould just keep that volume low and do\nsomething just to kind of touch it keep\nit activated and to maintain all those\nother things like flexibility range of\nmotion I would bet anything your\nadductors are probably underdeveloped\nright now you can get those by doing\nyour squats because you're not really\ndoing I'm sure in much adduction\ntraining and so this things like that\nthat just get lost when you're only\nthinking all big muscle groups that that\ncome inherent in doing the larger\nmovements and so you don't have to worry\nabout them or train them separately I\nappreciate that and in reality I do two\nto three really hard work sets of hack\nhack machine squats per week which is\nplenty for me to maintain and even get a\nLittle Bit Stronger but per our earlier\ndiscussion about a year ago I shifted to\ndoing very low repetition ranges to main\nstrength in that movement there you go\nbut I am actively avoiding hypertrophy\nin that muscle group yeah or another\nsolution would actually be do something\nlike one set to failure a week\nnot even extremely long just you know do\nsomething in the 8 to 15 repetition\nrange\num at the end of all that strength set\nand just get a little bit of pump there\nand then and then just so just so that\nthose muscles can touch that level of\nfatigue touch that level of strain and\nmechanical tension walk away\ngreat thank you for that\nwhat about exercise order amazing so\nimplicit in this exercise Choice thing\nit's what you're going to notice is\nthese modifiable variables interact with\neach other right and you can clearly see\nhow when we talked about volume and to\nclarify volume is the repetitions\nmultiplied by the sets that's typically\nhow we express the volume well that's\ngoing to be directly influenced by\nintensity the heavier load you put on\nthe barbell the less repetitions you can\ndo and the inverse right rest intervals\nthe shorter you keep your rest intervals\nthen either the lower the weight has to\ngo the intensity or the lower the rep\nrange has to go order is the same thing\nchoice is the same thing so all of these\nthings modify each other they play a\nlittle bit of a hand and what everything\nelse does so with the exercise Choice\nthing rolling into exercise order you\nget to play a couple of games here when\nwe talked about strength and power I\nbasically said stick to the big\nmovements most complicated and compound\nmovements first you don't have to do\nthat with hypertrophy you can do this in\na couple of ways you can do the thing\nyou're just simply most interested in\nfirst you can do this thing called\npre-fatigue so say you're you're going\nto do a back day you could go in and do\nnothing but isolated biceps as your very\nfirst exercise and then roll into your\nyour pulling movements because what\nyou'll see is during most pulling\nactivities the biceps are a secondary or\ntertiary muscle group but you've\npre-fatigued them you've guaranteed that\nmuscle of most interest God it's it's\nmost training in and everything else is\nsecondary so you can start if you want\nwith single joint movements you can\nstart with isolation stuff or you can\nstart with compound stuff either way it\njust really comes down to preference and\nwhat you're specifically trying to\ndevelop now this also goes back to the\nexercise Choice question right because\nit's sort of the same thing right like\nwhat which one am I choosing\nand where I wanted it the campus was the\nexercise splits and and so we just sort\nof talked about am I doing body part\nsplits and I know a question I get a lot\nhere is well which ones should I package\ntogether\nI'm not really concerned with it what\nyou all you should worry about is how\nmany times per week and in fact total\nvolume you achieve on a muscle group\nper week and I don't doesn't really\nmatter how those things are folded in\nit's really a personal preference issue\none mistake that we see here commonly\nis grossly under appreciating that the\nlegs are not a muscle group\nright so the legs have a whole bunch of\nmuscle groups in them so we see a\nclassic split like I'll Do shoulders and\nchest Monday and then I'll do you know\nbiceps and forearms Tuesday and then\nlegs Wednesday\nor whatever and then back to upper body\nand then I was like you're like wait a\nminute\nyou have four days dedicated to the\nupper body and one for quote-unquote\nlegs\nwell like you hopefully you can see the\nimbalance what's that's going to happen\nthere over time is you're going to do it\ndo far more upper body than you are\nlower body and that's not appropriate so\nyou just want to think about your lower\nbody like you would do if you're going\nto do body part splits then include\nthose things as well and they'll just\nchunk everything in as legs once a week\nif you want to do that that's actually\nokay but that day has to be very very\nchallenging and you probably should do\nquite a bit of volume\num there because you're almost surely\nnot going to hit the total weekly volume\nneeded to optimize muscle growth if\nyou're literally only doing once a week\nof your quote-unquote legs so along\nthose lines Let's Talk Volume yep how\nmuch volume does each muscle group need\nper week in order to generate and for\nthat matter maintain hypertrophy right\nso the kind of a minimum number we're\ngoing to look for here is 10 working\nsets per week correct per muscle group\ncorrect and just to make sure that\neveryone's on the same page if I do a\nchin up or a pull-up\nI'm going to mainly be training my back\nmuscles my lats if I'm doing it\ncorrectly lats and rhomboids and biceps\nright and a few so but they'll be\nindirect targeting of the biceps so\nwould you include indirect\ntargeting so for instance if I you said\n10 sets per week let's just use biceps\nbecause it seems that that's the go-to\nuh generic muscle for what why is that\nby the way that when people ask somebody\nto you know Flex their muscle they\nalways Flex their bicep they don't flex\ntheir calf or their quad or their glutes\nor something I guess there's some um you\nknow public decency issues I can tell\nyou uh with my children that's the very\nfirst muscle I taught them to flex their\nglutes no they're biceps\nand and good\num good uh healthy parenting advice from\nDr Andy Galpin so if it's 10 sets per\nweek\nfor biceps in order to maintain or\nfurther grow the biceps\nbut does that mean if somebody does 10\nsets of chin-ups or 10 sets of chin ups\nand rows that they are checking off any\nof the boxes for biceps assuming that\nthey're doing the movement properly yeah\nand targeting the major muscle group\nthat a given movement is supposed to\nTarget which in my mind when you're\ndoing a chin up you're supposed to\nmainly be using your back muscles and\nthen there are secondary muscles or\nsecondary activation of other muscles\nbut of course some people their arms\ngrow like crazy when they do chin ups\nand their back doesn't grow at all so\nthis is where we're back to the kind of\num genetic preloading of the system yep\num if you will so how does one meet this\n10 sets per week minimum when dividing\ndifferent body parts and thinking about\nthis\ndirect and indirect Activation so two\nthings there's no specific exact rule\nhere and this is why these set ranges\nare ranges right and this is why we\ndon't say like 10 is so 10 would be sort\nof the minimum number you want to get to\nthe more realistic number that most\npeople especially if you're Advanced or\neven intermediate is more like 15 to 20\nworking sets per week okay now if you're\nvery well trained you probably want to\neven push more towards like 25 and in\nfact past that\nthere's just not a lot of research so\nthe optimal number may be 30. we don't\nwe don't really know it's just hard to\nget that much work in um it may actually\nbe detrimental and here we're referring\nto Natural athletes that is people who\nfor whatever reason either because\nthey're not taking any prescription\ndrugs or maybe if they are whose levels\nof\nsteroid hormones\nmainly the androgens like testosterone\nEtc\ndo not exceed the normal reference range\nvalues either because that's what they\nare naturally or that's what they're\nreplacing through pharmacology whereas\nwhen we think of\ntechnically someone could be taking\nexogenous hormones to replace a\ndeficiency and then there's still a\nnormal range okay but I just want to\nclarify because you work with athletes a\nnumber of different sports where drugs\nare and are not tolerated Etc and the\ngeneral population that what we are\ntalking about here is for the general\npopulation not for steroid using\nathletes correct okay yeah great so\num so Ken was just sort of that like\nabsolute minimum number to maintain\nwhich is actually pretty cool if you\nthink about it this way uh if you went\nin and you did three sets of ten\nit's a very three sets of ten\nrepetitions correct\nyou're already at three you do that\nthree days a week\nyou're at your nine that's almost ten if\nyou also just went to the gym one day a\nweek you did three sets of ten and you\ndid three exercises\nyou're at nine is that working sets\nyou're basically done so achieving 10\nsets per week per muscle group and now\nwe're not even talking about indirect\nactivation of a secondary so you're\ngoing to hit 10 fairly easy\num extension to that hitting 20 is\nactually still not that hard because of\nwhat's actually going to happen there so\nin your example if you're doing your\nchin UPS well\nwould the biceps count there's no exact\nrule there because uh there could be\ntechnique issues it could be hand\npositions so you mentioned chin up very\nspecifically a chin up is actually going\nto put your hands in in this position\nwhere your palms are facing up right\nthis is supination and pronation so\nyou're gonna be there well that's\nactually quite different than a pull-up\nor your hands are in the opposite\ndirection so a chin up actually is going\nto be pretty good activator in your\nbiceps\nfor most people\num so you would expect actually to\nprobably count that because it's going\nto be very difficult to not see some\nfatigue in your biceps depending on your\nmechanics depending on and by that I\nmean just the the segment lengths of\nyour bones right that's where your\nmuscles or originate and insert there's\nbeen something you can do about it's not\neven a technique or a focus issue it's\njust simple fact the matter that's how\nyou pull best in that area the position\nin which your hands are on the wider\ngrip more narrow grip it's going to\nchange muscle use so we talked about\nearlier I think in the previous episode\nthat exercises do not determine\nadaptations applications do but\nexercises do determine things like the\nmovement plane The Joint you use and\ntypically The Eccentric concentric sort\nof ratio as well as oftentimes the\nmuscle groups involved so there's just\nnot a lot of things you can do depending\non how you are built of you know some\nexercises activating a secondary group\nand you don't want it so it's not always\na technique you it may just be that's\nhow you're built right and the same\ncould be true for a squat the high bar\nversus low bar sort of example we talked\nabout earlier it's you know you you\ncould see plenty of evidence on muscle\nactivation studies where people even\ndoing the vertical back squat style have\ntremendous glute activation and folks\ndoing the the low bar have tremendous\nquad Activation so a lot of it depends\non personal mechanics so what I counted\nis the question really you just have to\nask yourself number one\ndo you really care that much you know\nyou have a range to get to if you're\nanywhere between 10 to 25 working sets\nyou know you're fine so if you count it\nor don't count it it's just going to\nchange the difference between whether\nyou did 17 working sets or 23 and either\nway you're fine so I don't really care\nnumber two are you actually feeling\nanything there so if you're doing your\nchin ups and your biceps are blowing up\nI'm counting that right if you're doing\nit you're like no I don't feel any\nfatigue there it's all my then I'd\nprobably say okay we're not going to\ncount that as towards it so um you can\njust let that guide you a little bit\ntowards your account yeah I've always\nnoticed that there are certain muscle\ngroups that are very easy to isolate\nyeah when under load and those are\nalmost always the same muscle groups\nthat are easy to\ncontract very hard without any load\nwhatsoever Bingo you know that's\nactually really insightful so\num you can kind of use this heuristic of\nlike if you can contract your lats just\nstanding here you're probably going to\ncontract them very well when you lift if\nyou can't you can probably assume about\nthe same thing's going to happen so uh\nyeah you'll know\num this is actually the lats are\nactually really interesting because they\ntend to be one of the more difficult\nmuscle groups to learn how to activate\nso if you're in your journey you're just\nlike I have no idea and um you can look\nup like a lat pose so how do you like\nhow do you puff your last how do you\nshow it and if you do that and you're\nlike wow there's no movement here\njust recognize that's extremely common\nand that is probably going to take you\nmany many many months of trying before\nyou start to see some movements and\nprobably even a few years before you\nreally start to see Activation so you're\nnot some sort of like specific like\nspecial genetic anomaly it's very very\ncommon it's uncommon to not be able to\nactivate your biceps\nright that everyone can do that but if\nyou're just like man\nI can't get this here I'm just going to\nstop doing it do not do that just keep\nat it and just keep concentrating and\nthinking about that muscle group it will\ntake some time it's very common to have\nchallenges activating Lots yeah I've\nnoticed that many of the muscle groups\nthat were responsible for a large\nfraction of the work in the various\nsports that I played as a young child\nare muscles that are very easy for me to\nselectively isolate and induce\nhypertrophy in um I suppose I'm one of\nthose mutants where my lats happen to be\none such of those muscle groups but I\nthink that's because I swam a lot when I\nwas a kid literally going to ask me a\nswimmer yeah that's like a Telltale yeah\nevery every kid in my town swam and\nplayed soccer there you go and then\nlater I you know I skateboarded and did\nsomething you generally hear that\nanswers you either were a swimmer or\nyou're a wrestler\nso it's like that pulling and pull\ntoward you is\nthousands of repetitions allowed you to\nget very good at Contracting but because\num I also played soccer and\nskateboarding but I didn't do any\nbaseball basketball or football muscle\ngroups like deltoids are very\nchallenging to activate nicely yeah so I\ndo think that early development is\nsuperimposed on a genetic template that\nsort of predicts which muscle groups are\ngoing to be easier or harder to isolate\nand train it's also a very good case for\nwhy it's important to do as many\ndifferent athletic activities as you can\nin your youth yeah and if you do\nskateboard\ndefinitely learn to ride switch because\nevery every skateboarder I know has one\nleg that's larger than the other one\ncalf that's larger than the other and\nactually for that matter um people that\ndo martial arts that don't learn to um\nif they're not Southpaw if they don't\nlearn to switch up and do their uh their\nwork Southpaw you see the same thing I\nmean you're building an asymmetry into\nthe system and it's not just muscular\nit's neural oh strongly neural yeah um\nso yeah kids\num parents get your kids doing a bunch\nof different things I suppose gymnastics\nwould probably be the best sport all\naround in terms of movement in multiple\nplanes and activating all the different\nmuscle groups uh yes and no there's a\nlot of benefit no question about it\nthere's a lot of other things though\nthat it that has limited abilities so\num almost everything in not like gyms is\ngreat but almost everything in that is\npre-planned which is a major downfall\nright so the joy of skating is there's\nso much proprioceptive input that you\nhave to make decisions very quickly\num in in small Windows now you have a\nlittle bit of that when you're flipping\nin the air you have to land but you\ngymnastics gymnasts tend to have a very\nspecific routine that they're working on\nand they work on that routine for years\nso\num for me was Transportation it was\nfreedom and it didn't require any\ncoaches or parental oversight yeah yeah\nBall Sports have the beauty of reaction\nand things like that so all of them are\nwonderful\num yeah good to do a lot of them you've\nestablished that 10 really to 20 sets\nper week yeah is the kind of bounds for\num maintaining and initiating hypertri\nyep if I were to like flag one of them I\nwould say 15 to 20. is this that's right\nthat you want to get um working now\nit gets complicated when you ask well\nhow many reps per set\ndo I have to get to okay well\nwe also can complicate that by\nrepetition type and tempo just sort of\nlet all that go for now and just think\nif you're getting close to that range\nyou're in the spot and all you have to\ndo now is balance two things\nrecovery and continued training okay so\nif you're somewhere in this 10 to 20\nworking sets range and you're in a\nposition where you can continue to do\nthat you're not so sore and so damaged\nand beat up that you can't maintain that\nvolume for you know eight weeks at a\ntime or at least six weeks at a time\nthen I'd probably say either the style\nof repetitions the amount of repetitions\nper set you're doing are too much the\nvolume is getting to you however if\nyou're not seeing adaptations then I'd\nsay maybe the repetitions aren't enough\nand so that's like that's the kind of\ngame you're running now there could be\nplenty of other factors intensity of\ncourse yeah intensity\num intent and then of course the other\nthings sleep nutrition\nEtc all these other things that go into\nour visible stressor category that we\nalways analyze this sort of brings up\nthis idea of responders and\nnon-responders so we get this one a ton\nso why is it some people my gym buddy my\nroommate we go to sleep the same time\nwe're on the same nutrition plan we work\nout together she triples in muscle size\nand I don't have like no again\nwhatsoever well there's a lot of work\nthat we're trying to do to identify the\nmolecular mechanisms behind responders\nand non-responders because they clearly\nexist in fact this is one of the reasons\nwhy every paper I basically will ever\npublish again if I you know if I do\nalways reports individual person data so\nrather than group averages you get to\nsee you know if there's 10 subjects in\nit you get to see how each of the ten\nresponded because the group average can\nget confusing what you really want to\nsee is how many actually people got\nbetter how many got worse how many maybe\nchange you know so so we'll always\nreport those individual data because\nwhen you go to train you're you you're\nnot the group average that's very\nimportant to know\nall right so if you do that you can see\na beautiful line of these hyper\nresponders the bell curve in the middle\nof the normal responders and those folks\nwho like through any training study just\nwon't get any better if you can tease\nout what you can't but let's say in\nscience you could tease out all the\nextra factors total stress load\nhydration sleep\nEtc what you often see is non-responders\na lot of the time it's not that they\nhave a physiological inability it's just\nthat they need a different protocol and\na lot of times it's they just need more\nvolume\nso if they can handle that and they're\nnot successfully beat up just give them\nmore volume and they tend to see a lot\nof breakthroughs you see the same thing\nwith plateaus\nso typically it's sort of just like okay\nthe routine you're on you've been on it\nfor too long we need to either go to the\nother end of the hypertrophy Spectrum\nfor intensity which means like if you've\nbeen in the like 60 to 70 percent of\nyour one repetition max range maybe we\nactually need to go heavier\ntake our repetitions down maybe even our\ntotal volume down and go heavier try\nthat a great way to break through\nplateaus of grand if all the other boxes\nare checked\num the other one is is due to the\nopposite which is like okay we're gonna\ngo higher we're gonna go sets of 20. set\nto 25 High very high repetition range\nand really get after it not to do as\nmuch damage because you don't tend to\nget as sore from those really high\nrepetition ranges you'll get more sore\nfrom the lower repetition higher\nintensity range than you will typically\nthe other ones and and see if we can\nbust through some plateaus there so it\njust generally means you need to do\nsomething a little bit different than\nyour your training partner\nso we've talked about exercise choice\nand we've talked about the number of\nsets that one needs in order to induce\nhypertrophy per week\nwhat about repetition ranges you've\nmentioned some pretty broad repetition\nranges\nhow many repetitions per set is required\nin order to induce hypertrophy yep so\nthere are two caveats here before I give\nwell the number is somewhere between\nlike four\nto 30 reps 30 repetitions absolutely in\nfact I think you can go much higher the\nfirst 20 have to be feel exceedingly\nlight correct and during those first 20\nor so repetitions is the goal still to\ncontract the muscle as hard as possible\non each repetition so this is the\ncaveats here so\ncaveat number one\nis\nthere is an assumption that by the end\nof this set you're getting somewhat\nclose to failure\nand so you don't have to go to Absolute\nfailure\nto to induce most like perjury but you\nyou also have to get kind of close so if\nyou're going to do a set of 25 and you\nfinish it and you're like oh yeah like\nthat was kind of starting to get hard at\nthe end that's not going to be enough\nif you're going to do a set of five or\nsix and the same sort of expression\ncomes out of your mouth it's not going\nto be up so in that case it doesn't\nmatter your rep range if you're not\ngetting somewhat close to failure again\nit doesn't need to be complete failure\num a good number to think about is like\nminus two which is what we call reps and\nReserve which is sort of like I got\nwithin two or so reps of failure and\nthen I stopped and can we Define failure\nat least for sake of this portion of the\nconversation as the point at which you\ncan no longer move the resistance\ncould be your body could be yeah a\nweight machine Etc that you can no\nlonger move the resistance\nanymore\nin the concentric phase\nof the exercise movement in good form\ncorrect that's a really nice momentary\nmuscular failure is how we typically\nDefine it there's a wonderful review I\nthink it's open access that just came\nout in the last handful of months Eric\nhelms's team out of New Zealand Eric's\nis a great scientist and a very\nexperienced physique coach and a\ncompetitor himself so he knows a lot\nabout this area and that paper rent\nthrough all the exact definitions in\ndetail all the caveats that we're not\ngonna have time to get into today so I\nwould recommend folks like check that\nout if they want more information but\nI'll try to get the highlights of it\nright here so what they basically showed\nis\ngoing all the way to failure in the\ndefining failure like you just did right\nso momentary muscular failure you can't\ncomplete another repetition through\ncomplete range of motion through\nwhatever range of motion you determine\nprior to\nas well as with good technique so other\nbody parts aren't being compromised sort\nof Etc and doesn't need to be total\nfailure that minus two\nfailure is still needed\nin caveat two which is again very very\nhighly trained individuals you won't see\npeople who are like Eric or other folks\nwho are six to eight to ten years in a\nvery serious training\num who don't have to go to failure\nprobably a little bit more than what I\njust said so the the layout that they\nbrought in their paper was very nice and\nthey basically said okay here's a couple\nof scenarios in which going to failure\nis maybe the best way to do it number\none you probably should do it\non a little bit of the safer exercises\nso maybe taking your back squat on a\nbarbell to complete failure\nand doing that as like a standard\nprotocol multiple times a week it's\nmaybe not the best choice so maybe if\nyou're going to do barbell back squats\nyou take that to your you know your your\none or two reps in reserve stop there\nit's a lot of work it actually going\nback to our discussion on the prolapin\nchart it's a similar idea right where\nyou're going to spend most of your time\nin these working sets 70 to 90 sort of\npercent and then you're going to take\nthat failure to maybe the hack squat\nmachine or maybe even the leg extension\nmachine so a little bit of a safer\nexercise they also can tend to be single\njoint exercises don't have to be but\nthey're just ones that are not as\ncomplicated and you're not likely to\ninjure other body parts when you're\ndoing it all right\num so that's one one way to go about it\nanother way to go about it is simply\ndoing it on like the last movement of\nthe day right and so again you're not\ngoing to do it on your first three or\nfour exercises but whatever your last\nfinisher is you'll hit total failure on\nthat one and that kind of keeps you in a\nrange of yeah you hit some failure you\ngot a lot of overall work done so that's\na lot of stimulus that's a lot of noise\ngoing to that nucleus that says grow\ngrow grow but you didn't totally\nobliterate yourself\nespecially if you don't have the\nassistance of anabolic steroids right\nthat's very very important if you have\nthose you can push this a lot harder\nbecause your recovery would be\nsignificantly enhanced if not you kind\nof want to walk away from that I have to\nassume that you know 99 of people are\nsaying this do not and um and and yet\namong those who are not taking anything\nin terms of anabolics they're I think is\na large range of recovery quotients out\nthere some people just tend to recover\nbetter some people I think also are far\nmore diligent about what I would call\nthe um necessary but not sufficient\nvariables of yeah adequate sleep yep uh\nproper nutrition\nlimiting stress and and so on yeah I\ncan't wait to break all that stuff down\nI got a whole got a very long discussion\nfor all those things we will get into it\nin all its practical realities and\nactionables before long what about rest\nbetween sets great this is the interplay\nnow so one actually thing we said for a\nlong time is you want to stick between\n30 to 90 seconds of rest between sets\nfor hypertrophy and that's because\nyou're trying to\num activate this metabolic disturbance\nor disruption you'd need a little bit of\na burn a little bit of a pump to go\nthere more recent research a lot of this\nout of Brad show on Phil's lab and\nothers have shown that that's just\ndoesn't seem to be the case again for\nmoderate uh to newly trained individuals\nwhether that's the case for the highly\ntrained folks I don't necessarily know I\ndon't think there's any difference here\nso you can take up to three to five\nminutes of rest in between sets and be\nfine the caveat here though is this\nif you're gonna rest longer that means\nthe metabolic challenge is lower so you\nneed to then increase the challenge in\neither mechanical tension which think\nabout as weight load or muscle breakdown\nso you can't lower one of the variables\nkeep everything else the same and expect\nthe same result so if you're going to\nhave more rest then you need to either\npreserve the load on your bar or the\nvolume one of the two has to happen so\nthis gives people a lot of opportunity I\ngenerally tell people\nif you're going to train for hypertrophy\nit's probably best to stay in a two\nminute range at most you can go longer\nbut a lot of people have a hard time\nactually coming back and then executing\nthat next set with enough intent\nto get there and or it's going to make\nyour workouts tremendously long so you\ncan stick to the shorter one you don't\nhave as much mechanical tension but\nthat's okay you can still get there but\nin reality of it is you can do whatever\nyou would like\ntell me if this is a reasonable\nstructure given what you've told us\nthree exercises per muscle group\nfirst exercise\nslightly heavier loads so repetition\nrange is somewhere between let's say\nfive and eight with perhaps hitting\nfailure close to it on the last set\nrest periods of somewhere between two or\nlet's let's get wild and say five\nminutes okay so it's a little bit more\nof a strength type workout at that point\nbut then moving to a second exercise of\nthree or four sets where the repetition\nranges and now 8 to 15.\nshortening the rest periods to 90\nseconds or so and then on the third\nexercise\nrepetition ranges of 12 to 30. this\nnumber 30 kind of it makes me wide-eyed\nI know that can't remember the last time\nI did a set of 30 thinking it was for\nhypertrophy but what you're saying makes\nabsolutely senses or is research back so\nvery short rest intervals maybe 30\nseconds between between sets would that\nallow somebody to Target all three forms\nof major adaptation I mean my in my mind\nit works you know you're talking about\nmechanical loads you're talking about\nstress and damage and you're talking\nabout metabolic stress\nis that better than to for instance do\nall the high repetition work in one\nworkout per week\num and then higher loads in the other\nworkout it doesn't matter if you divide\nthem up or combine them it would not\nmatter I would say it matters in the\nsense of your personal practical\nsituation well long rest for me I love\ntraining heavier with longer rest right\nbut\nI'm hearing that there's real value to\ndoing these higher repetition ranges\nyeah so the formula you set up there in\na second is great if you want to do it\nthe other way that's fine you really\nit's kind of idiot proof you can set\nthis up however you'd like you could\nactually do the inverse theoretically\nyou could do the sets of 30 first and\nthen move to your sets of eight it\ndoesn't really matter because we're\ntrying to just get to a certain total\nstimuli and you're going to hit it\neventually so you have a lot of room to\nplay here you also have a lot of room to\nadapt based on your circumstances God\nI'm short on time today\ntypically my workout takes me 60 Minutes\nfor this plan I have I've only got 35\ntoday what do I do\nwell if you're training for strength\nthat's a different answer than if you're\ntraining for hypertrophy if you're\ntraining for a purge fee you need to\nmake sure you hit that total volume so\nin this particular case lower the load\nlower the rest intervals and just get to\nthe burn and get going as much as you\ncan if you're training for strength I\nwould rather you cut your volume in half\nget those few repetitions done at that\nhigh load and just don't do very many\nsets today that's a better result so the\ngoal that you're going after is going to\ndetermine what we call chaos management\nwhich is that thing like that um running\nout of time today my time is short or I\ndidn't even think my time was short\nsomething got cut off I'm not feeling it\ntoday I'm in a hotel\netc etc etc which is life right that's\ngoing to be 10 to 50 of your workouts is\ngoing to be chaos management well how\nyou make those decisions is going to go\nback to understanding number one what\ngoal you're going after the number two\nwhat are the physiological consequences\nwe call these physiological limiters\nfor each one and that's going to tell\nyou what to select and prioritize the\nvolume the intensity or whatever else\nI'd like to ask about\nfrequency but I'd like to frame it a\nlittle bit differently\nthan that I'd like to ask about total\nworkout duration which dovetails with\nfrequency because\nif one is hitting the appropriate number\nof sets per week\nand one is combining different muscle\ngroups on the same days well then\nworkouts are going to be a very\ndifferent duration than if one is doing\na different body part each day for\ninstance and so I feel like any\ndiscussion about frequency has to be\nwithin the context of workout duration\nand vice versa yeah if you are a\na lifting junkie and you're very\nconsistent in your schedule I'm actually\nokay with body parts but most people are\nnot that and so the concern there is if\nyou say are isolating and waiting to do\nyour glutes on one day of the week and\nsomething happens on that day\nyou might go another 13 days now before\ntraining it you know between workouts\nand that's really difficult to maintain\nthe frequency won't be high enough\nunless the load and volume on that one\nday is astronomically high it's just not\ngoing to happen so while if you look at\nthe research frequency in terms of how\nmany days per week doesn't matter that\nmuch as long as the total load and\nfailure are equivalent\npractically it's a challenge so it's\nhard because life gets in the way for\nmost people\nespecially if you have kids and a job\nand all these things over there so I\nactually prefer doing something more\nlike three days a week of total body and\nif something happens you've just missed\nthat body part for 48 hours 72 hours I\nlike that a little better for most\npeople not because it's more effective\nbut just because\nit's a little bit more resilient to life\nand you can get there if you wanted to\nactually do a little bit of a\ncombination so if you wanted to do like\ntwo days a week of whole body and then\ntwo days a week of a little bit of a\nbody part split then you're actually\nsort of hedging against all risks there\nas long as you get to that total number\nthere now there is actually some\nevidence in a couple of ways that maybe\na little bit more frequently is a little\nbit better but the difficulties now\nwe're going back to the practicality\nquestion of like how many people really\ncan train just their strength training\nsix days a week that doesn't count any\nof their long duration stuff it isn't\nother high heart rate their flexibility\ntheir okay it's just really really\nreally hard to get all that stuff in so\nit is it tends to be easier on folks in\nterms of execution and long-term\nadherence in my opinion to get that\nvolume accomplished in in a little bit\nmore frequent patterns but not once a\nweek so I like to kind of have it right\nthere for most people not again not\nbecause it is technically more effective\nbecause you're less likely\nto fail to progress because of skipping\na workout something popping up your\npower going out and your you know garage\ndoor being locked on your whatever\nimagine that that happened to me this\nmorning folks couldn't get out of my\ndriveway because the gate with the\nelectronic gate was uh down because the\npower was down anyway solve that problem\nyeah the way you describe it my sense is\nthat workouts will last somewhere\nbetween one and two hours of real work\nis that about right it doesn't have to\nbe nearly that long I mean you could\ncertainly get enough the work done in 30\nminutes if you're doing a whole body\nworkout yeah yeah absolutely so if\nyou're doing that three days a week\nso remember the numbers we're trying to\nhit here let's say we're trying to hit\n15 working sets per muscle group per\nweek that's five working sets per day\nfor muscle groups so if you did one\nexercise for that day let's say you did\nsquats you did five sets you did that\nthree days a week you're done there's\nyour 15.\nbut there are other muscle groups to hit\non the same day you're doing squats if\nyou're doing a whole whole body yeah so\nyou've gotten them all ready and so like\nall the leg muscles in that example\nare taken care of uh so you would not do\nseparate hamstring work you wouldn't\nneed to now hamstrings is actually a\nlittle bit of a caveat like that's a\ngood example of an exercise or a muscle\ngroup that's probably really good to\nmake sure you isolate it's challenging\nto get with your standard uh dead lift\nand and the squat it's one of the\nprobably ones that's most important to\ngo Target outside of that but in theory\ntheoretically though outside of that you\nwould get most of your leg muscles done\nwith even a single exercise and even if\nyou wanted to change it up so you said\nall right Monday I'm going to do a squat\nvariation uh Wednesday the next day I\nleft I'm gonna do some sort of deadlift\nhinging variation and then maybe Friday\nmy third day I'm going to do some sort\nof unilateral maybe rear foot elevated\nsplit squat or something like that all\nright maybe even a lateral lunge maybe a\ndifferent plane okay you're in a pretty\ngood spot you're going to hit most of\nthose muscles\num to your 15 working sets especially if\nyou take sort of that last set each day\nso pretty close to failure that's going\nto get some more serious work done but\nyou're not going to be so fatigued you\ncan't come back and train it a couple of\ndays later\nand you'll be fine so you could even\nsplit that up into two days a week and\nnow all you really have to do is hit\nsomething like seven working sets so\nmaybe that's two exercises per day maybe\nsome sort of a leg press and a leg hinge\nyou know three to four sets each you can\nhit six to eight sets that day you did\nthat three days a week now all of a\nsudden you're at that 20 24 sets but\nsame thing with the upper body I just\ngave lower body examples because you\nknow I like the lower body more so it's\nnot that challenging to get to those\nnumbers and split and those workouts can\nbe extremely short so if you're if\nyou're doing that three days a week\num you know you're getting you're doing\nthat one exercise everybody one exercise\nlower body that certainly shouldn't take\nmore than 40 minutes I'm happy to hear\nthat not because I don't like training\nyeah please please excuse the double\nnegative but I found that resistance\ntraining workouts that extend longer\nthan one hour of work and certainly\nlonger than 75 minutes of work leave me\nvery fatigued oh sure and fatigue to the\npoint where concentrating on cognitive\nwork throughout the day can be\nchallenging need a longer nap in the\nafternoon I'm a big proponent of naps in\nthe afternoon in any case but requiring\nlonger naps in the afternoon\nEtc so\nat least for me restricting the\nresistance training workouts to about 50\n50 to 60 Minutes of real work yeah for\nme three or four times per week has\nhelped tremendously so it's a case where\ndoing higher intensity work in a shorter\nperiod of time and actually hitting\nmuscle groups less frequently for me\nthat's again once directly once\nindirectly yep has worked really well\nand as you mentioned earlier this could\nvery well be explained by not my\nrecovery quotient as some sort of\ngenetic or physiological variable but\nthe way that I'm training and indeed I\nlike to do a few four straps and go to\nfailure on too many sets and you know\nI've weaned in the in that genre of\ntraining it's also fun like to just\ntrain hard it is it's really fun it is I\nthink that um I've learned a lot by\ntraining to quote unquote to failure of\ncourse I think there's a lot of learning\nin there provided it's done safely but\nwhat you're describing actually inspires\nme to at least give a try to these other\nsorts of splits and and ways of training\nfor hypertrophy and strengths because\nthis notion of not necessarily having\nyou go to failure and still being able\nto evoke strength and hypertrophy\nadaptations is a really intriguing one\nuh dare I even say a seductive one and\nthat leads me to a question that is\nbased on findings that I've heard\ndiscussed on social media which means\nvery little if anything unless it's in\nthe context of people who really\num know exercise science and you're one\nsuch person and that's this idea that\nbecause resistance training can evoke a\nprotein synthesis adaptation response\nbut that adaptation response is lasts\nabout 48 hours before it starts to taper\noff that the ideal in quotes frequency\nfor training a given muscle group for\nhypertrophy is about every 48 hours is\nthat true\nyes and no so a couple of things there\nremember in order to grow a muscle\nthere's multiple steps here so you have\nthe signaling response which actually\nhappens within seconds of exercise and\ncan last depending on the marker you\nknow up to an hour or two hours step\nnumber two then is gene expression and\nwe see that that's typically peaked\naround two to six hours post exercise\nand then you have following that protein\nsynthesis and that's that longer time\nframe somewhere between 12 hours there\nit's certainly not peaked for 48 hours\nit may be still there 48 hours from now\nbut it is is absolutely coming down at\nthat point depending on sort of a number\nof factors so that part of is sort of\ntrue so this is a combination of like\nsome half truths and some like maybe\njust pedantic things that aren't really\nthat important to differentiate the real\nquestion I think is is like okay is it\nokay to train sooner slash is it better\nto train sooner or actually is it better\nto wait longer\nthere's no real reason to think that you\nneed to train if the goal is hypertrophy\nany sooner than 48 hours afterwards I\ncan't think of an advantage that that\nwould confer\nI I also can't think of any practical\napplications\nathletes physique bodybuilders coaches\nthat ever found tremendous success doing\nthat so I would be very skeptical that\nthat is anyway better now could you do\nit in some instances of say you know\nyou've got travel coming up like that so\nthat you just yeah you want to preload\nthe system by destroying the muscle no\nproblem and then waiting seven days or\n14 days I've known people have done that\nbefore I do Vacations or layoffs every\ntime like every single annihilate\nthemselves and then take a two-week\nlayoff yeah and it's like there's no\nbenefit there other than psychological\nlike I just love it like it feels great\nto be super sore I feel less crappy not\ntraining for those couple days because\nI'm like I'm super sore anyway you need\nthe extended rest yeah of course and\nit's just like\nit's just a crappy justification in my\nbrain that like\nexcuse to do something really wild and\nthat I totally don't need and get way\nsore that I should get Dr Andy galvin's\nsuggestions of what not to do but that\nhe does yeah 100 so do as I say not as I\ndo the famous words of every research\nProfessor yeah I think 48 hours is a\nreasonable time uh to wait can't think\nof any advantage of going sooner than\nthat there's really not a tremendous\namount of advantage of waiting much\nlonger than that certainly 72 hours is\nfine as long as you're hitting these\nConcepts we've talked about you can let\nreally life\ndetermine that I mean there's situations\ntoo with like particularly our athletes\nwhere we have to kind of break that\nbecause of schedule obligations they're\nplaying every fifth day every third day\nor something like that you're just gonna\nhave to lift some back-to-back days\nyou're just gonna have to get it done\num but yeah I can't think of why I'd go\nout of my way to do that the\nsecond part of that question is let's\nsay somebody trains a muscle\nthey train it properly they hit it in\nthe appropriate rep ranges and\nappropriate rest Etc that the stimulus\nis there the adaptation is set in motion\nthey're getting someone where somewhere\nat 48 hours or so a protein synthesis\nPeak that's going to taper off yeah but\nthey don't train it 48 hours later or 72\nhours later they train it five or six\ndays later not because they're lazy not\nbecause they um they don't care but\nbecause they have other priorities that\nare woven in with getting hypertrophy in\nthis muscle right there are people who\nexist only to get hypertrophy in a given\nmuscle group but let's be fair most\npeople would like to grow that muscle\ngroup\nbut then does it necessarily mean that\nthe muscle starts to revert to its\npre-hypertrophic state that is does it\natrophy and get smaller again because if\nit doesn't I could see a lot of reasons\nfor hitting a muscle group once every\nfive days or seven days provided you\nhold on to the hypertrophy that you\ninitiated five or seven days ago yeah\nthere's no reason to think you will lose\nanything in that sort of a Time domain\nfive to seven days the only challenge\nwith training that infrequently is can\nyou actually get enough total volume\ndone so if you're going to train them\nalso once a week you either have to go\nto real failure real damage and soreness\nor you have to figure out a way to hit\n20 cents that day in that muscle not at\nall impossible especially if you're\nthinking well actually all I have to do\nis 15. I'm gonna do five sets of three\nexercises that's not outrageous not at\nall so so like absolutely possible if\nyou're wanting to go more towards 20\nwe're getting closer to that 25 like now\nit starts to get pretty challenging so\nscientifically the research will suggest\nit's going to be equally effective\npractically it's challenging for people\nto hit sufficient volume without just\nbeing so demoralized afterwards because\nthey're in so much pain they can't get\nout of their car because their legs are\nso trash they can't sit on the toilet\nand get back up without crying from pain\nso that's not good no that's not good I\nsay that because those are actual\nexamples that have happened in my life\nyeah I I I'm realizing as we're having\nthis conversation about ways to\nstimulate hypertrophy that I've sort of\ndefaulted to more intensity as opposed\nto volume because of the time factor I\nhave a lot of other things going on in\nmy life and So within that hour\nI Can't Get Enough sets in across all\nthe muscle groups I need to hit and I'm\nonly going to do it about once a week\nand so it's at least for me more\nadvantageous to just train extremely\nhard I actually use the pre-exhaustion\ntechnique that you mentioned before yep\nor pre-fatigue as you refer to it of\nhitting something really strong with an\nisolation exercise then doing compound\nexercises I'm starting to think based on\nwhat you've told me that pre-fatigue\nand then a compound exercise in some\nways it's not really two sets because if\nyou're going to fail your four straps\nyou're kind of pushing past failure then\nyou're doing a compound exercise and\nyou're doing that two or three times\nwell that sounds like four to six sets\nbut the force repetitions are almost\nlike an additional set right yep and so\nit's not 20 sets but it's four to six\nreally really hard sets that go beyond\nwhat we normally think of as a set\ntotally okay it's sort of the difference\nbetween running on concrete and running\non Sand when I go for a sand run it's a\nvery different experience totally yeah\nand this is why I should have mentioned\nthis at the very very beginning of our\nour chat today but all of these numbers\nthat I'll give you for any exercise\nadaptation you you cannot think of them\nas hard lines they are gradients and so\nwhen we think about the number for\nhypertrophy in terms of repetitions I\nsaid 4 to 30. what do you think happens\nat three do you think hypertrophages\nstops in fact the number you'll see in\nliterature is more like six to Thirty I\nactually slide it down to four though\nlike personal preference because of that\nbut it just Fades away what do you think\nhappens at rep 31 35 there's no it just\nFades gradually over time so you\nactually sort of brought this up one of\nyour other questions and I'm not sure if\nyou were even thinking about this or\nmaybe you were I just babbled on about\nsomething else but if strength happens\nbetween this like one to five repetition\nrange and hypertrophy typically happens\nin this like 8 to 30 range what happens\nif I were to do the sets of six or God\nforbid seven like seven and nine are\nthese numbers you just absolutely don't\ndo in strength training right it's just\nlike so that's a one two three four five\nsix got eight ten twelve like do not\nprogram a set of 30. now when I'm\ntrained sets of seven to nine yeah it's\ngreat\nuh we'll use sets of seven a lot with\nweightlifters because you can actually\ncount numbers more effectively but what\nhappens in seven to nine right so this\nis actually a wonderful area of these\nlike\nfive to eight repetitions where you're\ngoing to get a nice combination of a lot\nof strength gains and a lot of\nhypertrophy so someone who's coming in\ngoing man I want to get stronger and I\nwant to add muscle what do I do here\nwell that's actually a really nice\nanswer train pretty hard in that like\nfour to eight repetition range and\nyou're going to get a lot stronger and\nyou'll still induce a lot of hypertrophy\nif you want to really maximize\nhypertrophy I would probably spend most\nof your time in the 8 to 15 repetition\nper set range you can go up to 30.\nadmittedly though I don't think it's\noptimal to spend most of your time at\nmore than 15 reps per set it's very\nchallenging to maintain the focus\nrequired at rep 27 to actually get\nsufficient failure by rep there you just\nyou just give up way too early it's hard\nto do the same thing at the bottom end\nof that Spectrum in terms of of really\nheavy to get there so I really honestly\nthink 8 to 15 is still it's cliche it's\nthat textbook number but it's a reason\nthat's a like it is tried and true and\nvery very very effective if for instance\nyou want to get stronger though\nand not invoke a lot of hypertrophy you\nhave a couple of tricks you can pull\nnumber one stay south of that five\nrepetition range you do sets of one sets\nof two go as heavy as you can with all\nappropriate considerations\nand stick within maybe even up to three\nreps per set you start getting to four\nto five to six now you're gonna start\nitching towards that that hypertriot\nrange so stay down there do a lot more\ntotal sets so do a classic example would\nbe something like eight sets of three\nright you're going to get a lot of\npractice you're going to get 24 very\nhigh quality reps with a lot of rest in\nbetween okay you go from there you go to\nmanaging caloric intake making sure your\nprotein is still on point you want to\nrecover but if your total calories\naren't um you know greater than 10 to 15\nabove your maintenance needs then you're\nnot going to be able to put on a whole\nbunch of muscle mass because you just\ndon't have the fuel for it you can also\nthen space your workouts out so that\nstimulus isn't coming extremely often so\nif you do that thing a couple of times a\nweek it's not enough frequency in that\nsignal so remember that signal has to be\nfrequent or loud you didn't make it\nsuper loud and now you're not making a\nsuper frequent you can get very very\nvery strong like that and and put on\nvery low amounts of vibratory if that's\nsort of the choice\nso you told us a lot about volume and\nfrequency and how that relates to\nprotein synthesis and Recovery to evoke\nthe hypertrophy adaptation response how\nshould people think about systemic\ndamage and Recovery because obviously\nthe nervous system and the way it\ninteracts with the neuromuscular system\nis the site of all the action here or at\nleast a lot of the action\nand the nervous system can in fact\nbecome fatigued you know that has a\ngreat capacity but the whole system that\nwe're talking about can be worked to the\nextent that even if a muscle group like\nthe biceps or the back is being allowed\nto rest while you're training legs and\nother muscle groups that your whole\nneuromuscular system needs rest how does\none determine whether or not your entire\nbody needs complete rest or or low level\nactive rest or exercise of a different\nkind yeah yeah sure so I want to\nactually tackle this because we're on\nthe topic of hypertrophy I'm assuming\nthat that's the goal in mind here yes\nhere I'm asking specifically within the\ncontracts of hypertrophy I realize that\nfor other training goals the answer of\nthis question could be quite different\nyeah okay so we actually do this in a\ncouple of different ways let's start\nlocal and work back to systemic right\nbecause number one what you're really\nconcerned about is at the local muscle\nlevel is am I going to create excessive\ndamage\nand I don't necessarily mean muscle\ndamage I mean injury right so um the\nkind of rule of thumb we use is like\nthree out of ten in terms of soreness if\nyou're more than three out of ten in\nterms of soreness we're going to start\nasking questions if you're higher than\nsix out of ten we're probably not\ntraining this is subjective total\nsubjective measure right and you'll\nyou'll know very quickly right I feel\nlike if you can barely graze your PEC\nwith your fingertip and then you're like\nah I don't care what you score that\nwe're not training there's just no\ndamage if you're three out of ten if\nyou're just like oh I'm kind of like a\nlittle bit stiff here but once you get\nwarmed up you start feeling okay you're\nprobably okay to proceed there so that\nis is\na very easy way to just think about\nsoreness you're going to be a little bit\ntight depending on your training\nfrequency\nnow zooming out to systemic we use a\nwhole host of things so we actually have\na a whole host of biomarkers we use you\ncan get a lot of these from blood so you\ncan look at things like creatine kinase\nthat's the very common one marker of\nmuscle damage um we'll actually look at\nLDH we'll look at myoglobulin that's\njust like if you think about hemoglobin\nis the\num is the molecule that carries oxygen\nthroughout your blood the myoglobin is\nthe the part of that that's actually in\nmuscle so when muscle gets broken down\nthat gets leaked out and put in your\nblood that's one of the markers actually\nit's gonna be associated with things\nlike rhabdo which is uh like you're\ngoing to see your urine is purple and\nit's extremely dark because you've got\nso much muscle breakdown that that\nhappens and kidneys can have a problem\nand you put a bunch of stuff in there so\nwe use those biomarkers we'll actually\nalso look at probably a couple things\nyou're familiar with alt and ASD these\nare excellent biomarkers of muscle\nbreakdown so if we are actually\nsuspecting that this is a chronic\nproblem we're going to actually go and\npull some blood if it's just like I'm\nsuper sore today we're going to use that\nsubjective marker but if we're seeing\nthis as constant like man are we really\npushed pushing you way too much is there\nsome sort of systemic problem we're\ngoing to blood and we're going to look\nat all those different things now AST to\nalt is really specific and I don't want\nto take us too far off track here but\nthe ratio to those things is actually\nvery important as well so if you look at\nthe AST to alt ratio typically the\nnumber we'll look at is like 1.67 as\nthat ratio is like higher than that you\nhave a pretty high risk of muscle damage\nbut really\nbetween you know me and you and a few of\nthese listeners anytime we start seeing\nAST out kick alt we're immediately\nthinking it has a ratio being higher\nthan one we're immediately thinking like\nthere's something happening muscle\ndamage wise so um that's actually a\nsneaky good indicator of just total\nmuscle mass because the vast majority of\nthat's going to be in muscle so those\nare actually some markers that we like a\nlot if muscle damage is the thing we're\nconcerned with if we are more concerned\nwith things like total training volume\nsystemic overload then we may turn to\nsomething more like sleep there's a lot\nof information we can actually get gland\nfrom changes in sleep behavior and\nfunction you could also look at things\nlike HRV heart rate variability which is\na very classic marker and much more\nsensitive to changes with training than\nsomething like a resting heart rate\nwhich is which is one thing you can\nactually do that's totally cost free\njust look at your changes and any\nelevation resting heart rate over time\nespecially more than three to five\nconsecutive days it is an indicator but\nHIV is much more sensitive to things\nlike training induced overload so that's\na quick version of stuff that we're\ngoing to pay attention to the last one I\nwould add there is simply motivation\nso if you're really training hard and\nyou like training hard and you just like\ncannot force yourself to go anymore that\nin of itself can be a good indication of\nit's maybe not the day maybe not the\nweek with all of these things you want\nto be careful about overreacting to a\nsingle day measure again we look we need\nto look at at least a trend of more than\nthree days honestly I'm looking at more\nthan five days I'm gonna pull back from\nthat and think about what phase of\ntraining we're in what part of the Year\nwe're in typically with our athletes\nwe're in season preseason post-season\noff season Etc to make our decisions\nabout what we're going to do about it\nare we canning the entire workout are we\ndoing a modified lower version lower\nintensity my default generally if\nhypertrophy is the goal remember\nvolume is the driver there so if I can\nlike can we get in can we go real light\nlet's go to 6 out of 10 rpe so relative\nperceived exertion maybe we'll reduce\nthe range of motion maybe we'll make it\na little bit easier maybe go to machines\nor instead of going a squat we'll just\ndo you know uh leg extension something\nlike that but I want to still get enough\nvolume in there that will keep you on\ntarget any again even going at 50 not\nnot to high repetition you know 50 for a\nset of ten three sets just get a nice\nblood flow in there get it in get it out\naid in recovery and then move on and\ncome back the next day that's probably\nwhat I would do rather than canning the\nentire session\nhow do other forms of exercise\ncombine with hypertrophy training\nfor instance can I do cardiovascular\ntraining for two or three days per week\nprovided that cardiovascular training is\nof low enough intensity and not disrupt\nhypertrophy progression\nand\ncan I do that cardiovascular exercise\nbefore or after the hypertrophy training\nor does it need to be separated out the\nanswer to this is really what we call\nthe crossover air interference effect\nokay it's really an energy management\nissue so the only time\nendurance exercise starts to interfere\nor block or hinder attenuate hypertrophy\nis in one of two broad categories number\none total energy intake or your balance\nis off so you can ameliorate this by\njust eating more if you do that then the\ninterference effect generally goes away\nthe second one is you want to make sure\nyou avoid exercise forms for your\nendurance training that are the same\nworking group and specifically The\nEccentric portion so for example we see\nmuch more interference with running\nunlike hypertrophy then we move cycling\nright less eccentric pounding and\nloading less damage less things to\nrecover from the tissue seems to be\ntotally fine the only other thing you\nneed to worry about here is total volume\nof your endurance work so if you're\ndoing a moderate intensity for a\nmoderate duration say 70 of your maximum\nheart rate for 25 minutes it's unlikely\nto do much damage in terms of blocking\nhypertrophy you're totally fine can you\ndo it before or after your workout it's\nprobably not going to matter that much\nall right so pre-fatigue is okay for\nhypertrophy so if your pre-fatigue is\ncoming from endurance then you're\ntotally fine not a big deal afterwards\ncool you want to break it up into\nmultiple sessions that's probably better\nright so if you do your endurance work\non a separate day that's probably best\ncase scenario if you can't do that but\nyou can break it up into two workouts\nsay you lift in the morning and then you\ndo your quote-unquote cardio at night\nmaybe that's second best third best is\ndoing it at the end of your lift and\nfinishing it that's fine just make sure\nthat you're maximizing your recovery on\nall the other tricks we'll talk about\nlater make sure the calories are there\nmake sure you're not doing a lot of\neccentric Landing in that endurance\nstuff and you'll be just fine and where\ndoes higher intensity cardio fit into a\nhypertrophy program so higher intensity\ncardio for instance in my mind is\ngetting on the assault bike and doing\num you know eight intervals of 20 second\nSprints and 10 second rest in between or\nperhaps go into a field and doing some\nbounds and Sprints and things of that\nsort not going all out not you know\nrunning for one's life but getting up to\nabout you know 85 90 percent of of\nrunning for one's life so we have a lot\nless information on the potential\ninterference or not of high intensities\nof it um the stuff we do have suggested\nit may actually Aid\nand hypertrophy and that's because if\nyou think about it one the potential\npaths to activation and muscle growth is\nthis metabolic disturbance you're going\nto get that a lot with the the high\nintensity interval thing so it's not a\nterrible thing to do I wouldn't do it to\nthe level that it compromises your\nability to come back and do your primary\ntraining so if you're so fatigued your\nlegs are super heavy and they're\ndepleted you now have to ingest extra\ncarbohydrates to replenish muscle\nglycogen to be able to handle both\nrecovery and continued training Etc that\ncould then lead to a problem but in\ngeneral we really don't see any reason\nwhy that is going to completely block or\nor make it such that your training was\nquote unquote wasted or it didn't work\nin fact actually\num a very recent study came out where\nthey had individuals perform six weeks\nof purely aerobic endurance steady state\nlong duration endurance for six weeks I\nthink prior to starting a hypertrophy\nphase compared that to individuals who\ndid not do that and those folks that did\nthese six weeks of just I think it was\ncycling actually\njust endurance work\nhad more muscle growth at the end of\ntheir hypertrophy training than those\nfolks that did not\nso this shows you very clearly there are\na lot of advantages that come with being\nphysically fit to Growing muscle so\nfolks that also have actually hit\nplateaus a lot one of the things you may\nactually see some benefit from is\nactually doing a little bit more\nendurance work whether it's a steady\nstate stuff maybe a side the higher\nintensity stuff certainly if you're\nstarting a training phase it's a pretty\ngood idea to do that and there's a\nnumber of physiological reasons of why\nthat's potentially occurring but the the\nlowest hanging fruit here is weak sort\nof joke you know like if you're so unfit\nthat you're tying your shoes in your\nwarm-up and you're already breaking a\nsweat you probably don't have enough\nFitness to do enough training to get\nenough hypertree so that is in fact your\nlimiting factor you're not recovering\nyou're super fatigued and damaged and\nsore\nbecause you're so unfit so get fit first\nand then you can actually get more gains\na week later so you have to kind of Kick\nthe Can down the road for a few weeks\nbut 10 weeks later you'll be in a better\nspot than you were by investing a little\nbit in your conditioning so as you\npointed out before and I can only assume\nyou're referring to me hypertrophy\ntraining is idiot proof meaning there's\na lot of leeway in the variables but not\nso much leeway that people can do\nanything it it's bounded by these\ngeneral principles\nso with your permission I'm going to do\na brief overview of my notes based on\nyour description of the modifiable\nvariables that will direct somebody\ntowards hypertrophy keeping in mind this\nbackdrop of exercise Choice exercise\norder\nselecting appropriate volume that sets\nand Reps training frequency and needing\nsome Metric or way to have progression\neither by adding more weight or by more\ntension or more metabolic stress and so\non\nin terms of exercise Choice it sounds\nlike the choice of exercises is not\nsuper critical in terms of specificity\nyeah but that the ideal circumstances\nthat people are targeting all the major\nand frankly\nsecondary and minor muscle groups if you\ncan even call them that yeah across\ntheir exercise choices that they're\npicking exercises that they can perform\nsafely and that they can generate enough\nintensity so they're getting close to\nfailure without placing themselves into\ndanger right so um for some people that\nmight mean including large compound free\nweight exercises like squats and\ndeadlifts and bent over barbell rows as\nwell as isolation exercises and for some\npeople there might be a biased toward\nmore isolation exercises and machines\nbut of course machines don't necessarily\nmean that you can't use heavy loads in\nfact plate loaded machines like Hammer\nstrange machines it will allow for quite\nsubstantial loads so picking two or\nthree or more movements per muscle group\ncan be valuable\nbut that overall\nconsistency is going to outshine\nvariation in the sense that you don't\nneed to hit muscles with a different\nexercise every workout coming back to\nthe same things\nhas a benefit and we heard about this in\nour discussion around strength and power\nas well\nokay\nin terms of order of exercises there too\nit sounds like there's a lot of\nflexibility one could\ndo the large compound exercise\nfor let's say quadriceps and hamstrings\nand glutes first like a squat or a front\nsquat\nor could deadlift for that matter but\nthen if one deadlifted and primarily hit\nthe glutes and hamstrings then you might\nwant to Target the quadriceps more\ndirectly with leg extensions or if one\nsquatted and was loading that squat bar\ncarrying the squat bar in a way that was\npredominantly quadricep yeah and less so\nglute and hamstring than leg curls would\nbe a good choice Etc okay and train your\ncalves folks\nvery important unless you're a genetic\nfreak of course it's actually a good\nopportunity to say unless you're a\ngenetic freak or you just have a genetic\npredisposition yeah or you've done\nSports and and you have a genetic\npredisposition that gives you you know\nvery large caps that don't require any\ntraining at all I I know people like\nthis they're they're somewhat rare but\nthey're out there yeah and those folks\nsometimes want to stay away from or\nminimize their training you told me that\neven if you have a muscle group that's a\nhyper responder\nin terms of hypertrophy getting at least\none or two\ngood hard sets per week is good because\nyou want to keep functionality in that\nneuromuscular system love it okay in\nterms of volume again we have a large\namount of variation is what I'm hearing\nthat the total number of sets per week\nis a strong driving force of program\ndesign and selection\nthat ideally you're performing 10 to 20\nand probably more like 15 to 20 sets per\nweek and that could be divided up across\nmultiple workouts or done in one workout\nbut that's 10 to 20 sets per week per\nmuscle group\nnot really taking into account indirect\nActivation so that would be 10 to 20\nsets for biceps\nyour back work is going to hit your\nbiceps a little bit maybe a bit more\ndepending on the exercise selection but\nit's really 10 to 20 and given that\nhypertrophy can still occur and maybe\neven occurs better with more volume yeah\nthen don't include the indirect work\nunless\nsomething about the architecture of your\nbody and the inability to engage certain\nmuscle groups like makes the a pull-up\nreally an arm exercise for you do I have\nthat right the way that I would maybe\nDefine it is typically with movements we\nconsider to be there to be primary\nmovers secondary movers and then\ntertiary right if it is a primary or\nsecondary I'm probably counting it if\nit's tertiary or less I'm probably not\ncounting it got it so going back to our\nexample of a pull-up so an example of a\npull-up I probably wouldn't count the\nbiceps in a pull-up but I would probably\ncount the biceps during a chin up would\nyou count the rear deltoid in a pull-up\nprobably not maybe like uh it just\ndepends um probably not though okay\ntrain the rear delts also that's only\nhonestly the reason I answered that is\nbecause most people don't do anything\nfor the real adults anyways but they\nshould right absolutely that's why I\ndidn't want to count it I wanted you to\ngo out of your way to make sure you did\nsomething specifically for the real rear\ndelts for Aesthetics and for\nfunctionality for health and and balance\nacross the shoulders totally neck uh\nshoulder all of it I'm so happy to hear\nyou say this I'm a huge fan of people\ndoing rear deltoid work for all the\nreasons you described n network for that\nmatter I think people forget that the\nneck is the upper part of your spine\nyeah yeah and for postural reasons and\nfor stabilization safety reasons it's\nreally critical but\nI think most people aren't familiar with\nhow best to train the rear deltoids and\nneck and I know a number of people are\nafraid of getting a big neck which for\nreasons that are still unclear to me is\nreferred to as no neck but let's leave\nout that no neck comment for the moment\nwhat are some good exercises for\ntargeting the rear deltoids and neck\nsafely\nthat people can perform for\nstabilization and for hypertrophy yeah I\nwould recommend people check out Eric\nCressy he is a wonderful strength\nconditioning coach he actually is I\nthink the director of pitching for the\nNew York Yankees now is that spelled\nc-r-e-s-s-i-e\nc-r-e-s-s-e-y I believe and he's got a\nfacility in uh I believe Boston as well\nas in Florida so he's very very involved\nin pitching as well as hockey and things\nlike that so\num he has so many free videos and\nresources on a on so much of the\nshoulder girdle mostly because he he's\ndealt with overhead and throwing\nathletes and so the Precision required\nthere is tremendous so you want to be\nvery careful when you start playing in\nthis area because the wrong positioning\nof your scapula can cause a whole bunch\nof problems in your neck and low back\nand so he would be a great resource to\ngo take a look at that um depending on\nhow your your scapulas are gliding and\nsliding and the way that you want your\nrotator cuffs firing your rhomboids\nthere's it's like very complicated very\nquickly so you want to learn more go\nthere\nas a very very quick couple of answers\num one of my favorite exercises is is\nlying on a bench or putting some bench\nand then just doing a reverse fly\nbasically the reason I like stabilizing\nthe rest of the body so you can make\nsure you can focus on just using those\nrear dual ties and putting your your\nscapulas in the right position now\nthere's a there's a specific set of\ncueing that you want the scapula to move\ndown and back for again check out Eric\nor any number of folks in that area to\ndo it but that's a very simple way uh\nthe reverse fly to get there great and\nthen in terms of neck exercises I was\ntold to avoid Bridges because they can\ncause damage to the discs I will\nprobably never do a bridge ever uh the\nrest of my life so isometrics are a\ngreat exercise for that because if you\nthink about what uh what you're asking\nmuscle groups to do in the neck you\nmostly want it to be able to do a\ncertain type of rotation a little bit of\nflexion extension and some some other\nmovements but in general it should be\nbeing stable so you want to walk through\nthese joints by asking kind of what they\ndo are they a moving joint are they a\nstability joint in this case you want to\nbe there so isometrics are going to put\nyou in a much better position there are\nsome actually pretty cool devices that\nyou can wear and you can put them on\nyour head and you can do all kinds of\nmovement and get some great training\nthere those are great starts but if you\ndon't have any of that just basic\nisometrics are a great way to go about\nit um neck Bridges would not be on that\nlist for me no neck Bridges folks\nin terms of sets and repetitions we\nbriefly touched on this but anyway from\nI believe six repetitions all the way up\nto 30 repetitions but probably more in\nthe\n8 to 15 repetition range for hypertrophy\nmost of the time yeah and I'll just\nthrow in there because I love this idea\nthat if you want to get a\nrelatively balanced adaptation related\nto strength and hypertrophy that seven\nto nine range the the No Man's uh or Dan\nno woman's uh land of\nof training repetitions I always joke in\nclass I'm like okay we go through the\nwhole thing right you're like one to\nfive strength eight to twelve you know I\nperch reading like right and then I'm\nlike okay so six to nine means nothing\nwill happen at all the kids are just\nlike writing it down like\nright a good way to for everybody to\nremember that there are adaptations\ntriggered in the six to nine rep range\nand it's a balance of strength and\nheight you'll just get thrown out of any\ngym that I'm a part of fantastic if you\ndo that uh so\nbut the important point is to get close\nto failure and occasionally hit failure\nmaybe occasionally throw in a forced\nrepetition or a rest pause where you\nrest and then do a few more something\nlike that but those intensity increasing\nManeuvers will require a little bit more\nattention to recovery either time or or\nattention in some other way and here's a\nlittle bit of care and I'll throw at\npeople\nbecause people generally don't like to\nbe told to not go to failure that often\nright so there's a handful of like half\nthe folks are like sweet I don't have to\ntrain that hard to get there and those\nfolks it's like well yes but I also said\nyou just can't like do a half workout\nyou have to get pretty darn close to\nfailure and most people don't really\nknow what failure means so for that\ngroup it's actually it's still probably\nharder than you think you want to train\nthe other group though that like wants\nto completely blow themselves out every\nsingle time\ndragging them back is more the key now\nfor those folks here's what I can say\nif you make sure that your hidden\nstressors invisible stressors are\ncompletely taken care of you can go to\nfailure a lot more often and so you need\nto dial those things in and then now you\ncan go hammer yourself because you'll\nrecover so much quicker and we see this\nvery commonly in all of our programs\nwith our athletes and our non-athletes\nthat when we get the rest of the Hidden\ninvisible stressors taken care of their\ntraining volume goes up so much because\nthey'll just start coming back and\nthey're like oh my God I'm not sore\nanymore oh my God I'm not nearly a sore\nI did this exact workout you know\ncountless times before and now I'm doing\nit and I'm not sore at all anymore what\nthe hell like we didn't do anything\ndifferent with the programming or really\nthe nutrition but we got the rest of\nthat allostatic load under control and\nboom things take off it's a lot like\ndrivers so many people seem to be riding\nthe brake and so many people seem to be\nheavy on the accelerator yeah that's\nactually one of the ways we describe it\nis like you want to go faster people's\ninclination step one is to hit the gas\nour our step number one is making sure\nyour left foot's not on the brake you'll\ngo faster with less resistance which\nmeans you'll actually wear down the\nsystem a lot slower by just taking your\nfoot off the brake first if you're then\nnot going fast enough now we can push\nthe accelerator but I'm not pushing that\naccelerator while your foot's still on\nthe brake you're going to go a little\nbit faster but not as fast as you should\nbe going with that much work and you're\ngoing to start wearing down brake pedals\nand things like that so I like the\nanalogy\nso hitting that 10 to 20\nsets per week repetition range is pretty\nbroad provided you get close to failure\nhit failure every once in a while could\nbe the final set of each exercise or\nmaybe do one workout where you hit\nfailure on everything but then you don't\ndo it for a few more again there it\nsounds like there's a lot of play in the\nsystem here\nrest ranges anywhere from 30 seconds all\nthe way up to three or four minutes\ndepending on how heavy you're training\nand how close to failure or to failure\nmaybe even quote unquote Beyond failure\nif there is such a thing you're training\num throwing in negatives and things like\nthat we didn't get into really high\nintensity techniques but people again\nvary in the extent to which they're\npushing the system but\nthere does seem to be some value to\nmixing up the\nrest between set ranges across exercises\nand across workouts but you could\ncombine them all in the same workout as\nwhat I heard yep\nand then in terms of progression it\nsounds to me like the goal when\nhypertrophy training is not necessarily\nto add more weight to the bar although\nthat's one way one could do it but that\nthe progression actually can arrive\nthrough this really extensive kit of\nchanging the speed of movement changing\num the number of sets adding some volume\nmaybe changing the split so that you go\nfrom a three day a week full body\nworkout to more of a body parts one or\ntwo body parts per day every other day\nor two on one off at any number of\ndifferent variations that are out there\nsounds like all of these can and will\nwork provided that people\nare obeying the general principles of\nthis uh hypertrophy adaptation inducing\nprotocol that you described and that\nthey are meeting the necessary but not\nsufficient variables as well\nsuch as sleep nutrition and managing the\nstress in the rest of their life\ndo I have that correctly yeah that's\nreally really good uh one more thing I'd\nlike to add is this is a situation for\nhypertrophy in which there are some\nexercises\nthat I actually don't think are good\nideas so I want to make sure we included\nthose in the conversation that's not\nnecessarily the case for strength you\ncan really do kind of whatever one you\nwant and that is\nspecifically Plyometrics although in\nfact if you look at there's a recent\nreview paper came out showing that like\nPlyometrics are effective as well right\njust like one can do almost anything as\nlong as it falls within this parameter\nset the concepts are few and the methods\nare many and the methods for hypertrophy\nare many many\nin general though Plyometrics are not my\nfirst second or even like 100th choice\nfor hypertrophy they if they're a part\nof a total training program and you get\nsome of our purchase as a result cool\nyou're lucky not the first place I'm\ngoing the other major category are\nweightlifting variations so that when\nI'm saying weightlifting I mean\nspecifically Olympic weightlifting as in\nSnatch clean and jerk and their\nvariations those are just not a good\nexercise Choice it's not that they don't\nwork\nit's just the risk to benefit ratio\nstarts to fall pretty fast and in the\nnegative favor and so it's just not\nworth doing sets of 10 of a snatch\nunless you're in a sport where that's\nlike the competition or whatever but if\nthe goal is simply hypertrophy choose\ndifferent exercises than that great\nnow I realize that we are going to do\nentire episodes related to nutrition\nsupplementation recovery Etc but I'd\nlike to just touch on two or three\nspecific topics and questions that come\nup a lot around the\nquestion of hypertrophy specifically and\nthat probably also relate to strength\ntraining and training for Speed\nso I'm going to ask these in\num not rapid fire but I'll give you\nshorter answers we'll put it that way so\nI will ask these questions now but with\nthe caveat that we will get into these\ntopics in much more depth yeah very soon\nthe first question is about the use of\ncold showers and Ice baths and cold\nwater exposure which I know many people\nuse for resilience training to increase\ntheir dopamine which it does\nand for recovery but\nthere's also this issue of when one\nshould use cold that is deliberate cold\nexposure relative to hypertrophy\ntraining specifically\nand\nthat's because I've heard that if\ndeliberate cold exposure is done too\nsoon after a hypertrophy adaptation\ninducing workout yeah right all the\nsorts of things we've been talking about\nthat the hypertrophy response can be\nblunted reduced or eliminated is that\ntrue and if so when could people do\ndeliberate cold exposure while still\nalso including hypertrophy training in\ntheir program and still get hypertrophy\ngreat so you know I'm a lover of the\ncold I still have a deep freezer in my\nhouse that is filled with water at all\ntimes that is plugged in and is a frozen\nchamber I still do the old school style\nof it please unplug it before you get in\nit oh yes absolutely and then don't do\nit by yourself so that the lid can close\non top of you and then we don't see you\nsort of ever again the Han Solo effect\nit's time for me to upgrade and get one\nof these new fancy ones but I've been\nusing this for so many years so I love\nit obviously I've been involved with xpt\nand and Gabby and Laird and Brian\nMcKenzie and these folks so I've been\ndoing this stuff for a long time I've\nbut I don't even know how many hundreds\nof folks in the ice and a lot of reasons\nso there are a lot of benefits and we\ncould talk about those later however\nthat that being said it is very very\ntrue you do not want to get in the ice\npost hypertrophy training you wouldn't\nwant to do that immediately after the\nworkout you probably don't want to do it\nbefore the workout and you probably\ndon't even want to do it that same day\nit's just not worth it it will blunt I\napprecially in specifically we've talked\nearlier about what's driving muscle\ngrowth is that signaling Cascade through\nthat gene expression through that muscle\nprotein synthesis cold exposure blocks\nthat signal\nremember adaptation comes from stress\nyou've put in a stressor in now you've\nblocked that stress you've literally\nblocked this signal that tells your body\ncome back and grow larger size so not a\ngood idea to do it if you're training\nfor some other purposes\nmaybe strength maybe there's an argument\nthere although maybe not for Speed and\npower maybe get away with the endurance\nmaybe a separate conversation if you're\nin season\nI have no problem using it immediately\nafter a game the goal is entirely\ndifferent even if we did a hypertrophy\ntype of training program we're not doing\nit try to try to maximize growth in that\nparticular case our priority for\nRecovery is higher than our priority for\nmuscle growth so we choose optimization\nin that category you can only make those\nchoices though when you truly understand\nwhat is the goal for the day the week\nthe month the phase of training and\nreally what part of the year you're in\nwe have that all plotted out for for all\nthe people we work with so I know when\nwe want to choose one over the other\nit's not a this is the choice you always\nmake such a nation that's just not how\nwe operate we need more Precision than\nthat so that being said we're generally\nnot going to do it if we want to do a\nlot of icing during a phase in which\nwe're\nusing a lot of hypertrophy we're going\nto do a couple of things number one we\nmay just not use it so there are phases\nin our training where I don't want to\nmaximize recovery\nI'm not going to give you any tricks\nhere I'm not going to do ice or any of\nthe other methods we're going to talk\nabout why because the whole point is to\ncause overload that's what's going to be\nthe stimuli to cause adaptation if all\nI'm doing is blocking that stuff\nattenuating it smashing it back down I'm\nundercutting myself I'm choosing to feel\na little bit better to have a little bit\nbetter performance right now knowing\nthat's going to compromise the results\nI'm going to get 6 8 10 12 weeks from\nnow all right so I'm not going to choose\nit at all in reality of it is if I\nreally am trying to maximize hypertrophy\nI'm probably not doing any ice work\nthrough that whole phase maybe like my\noff day I know that's similar to a setup\nyou have like one day a week when I'm\nnot training we'll jump in some ice\nmaybe even do some hot cold contrast I\nlove the xbc protocol it's you know\nyou've probably talked about it before\nthat's a great setup or just not do it\nat all right it's just not something we\nneed when we move into another phase of\ntraining where we're trying to maximize\nadaptation or maximize the result and\nand get the benefit of that training now\nwe're going to hedge more towards\nrecovery and we're going to bring in\nsome of these strategies and techniques\nand not worry about causing the most\nstimuli there because we're trying to\nadd attenuator because we're trying to\nactualize the work we did 6 8 10 12\nweeks before what about cold showers do\nthose have the same hypertrophy blunting\neffect in general no in general you can\ndo cold showers that's not going to be a\nproblem you're not going to be in there\nvery long and you're not going to get\nnearly as cold as you will submerge in\n30 degree ice water for like that the\nway that we do it nonetheless so I have\nno problem standing in the shower for a\ncouple of minutes using it for other\nreasons if you want to that's no issue\nI'd like to talk a little bit about\nnutrition and supplementation as it\nrelates to hypertrophy\nDr Lane Norton who's been a guest on the\nHebrew and Lab podcast and we both know\nthroughout a number range\nrelated to protein intake\non the backdrop of how much protein\nsynthesis can occur by meal across the\nday Etc\na lot of a lot of research done there\nand some important work by him in\nparticular and then the value that he\nthrew out was\n1.6 grams\nper kilogram of body weight being the\nlower end of the range up to I believe\nis it was as high as 2.4 maybe even as\nhigh as 2.7 grams of protein per\nkilogram of body weight per day\nthat's a pretty broad range but it's on\nthe higher end of what I think most\npeople think of in terms of protein\nintake and then again some people might\nalready be right there or maybe even\nabove that value now of course this all\ndepends on whether or not people are\nomnivore vegan uh\nmeat based Etc we won't even go there\nbut assuming people are getting enough\nprotein per day so somewhere in that\nrange and they are spreading out that\nprotein intake\nto accommodate the fact that the body\ncan only assimilate a certain amount of\nprotein in any given sitting\nwhat do you like to see people ingest at\nsome point post hypertrophy inducing\nworkout in order to\nget\nthe protein synthesis\nAdvantage if you will yeah that is\nstimulated by that workout\nearlier you mentioned the you know the\npost-training feeding window that you\nknow in the 90s and probably earlier\npeople were talking about oh you know\nwithin the first 90 minutes you have to\nget 30 amounts for a while yeah was it\n30 minutes of excuse me a certain number\nof grams of carbohydrate and protein Etc\nI think now the understanding is that\nthat window is much broader\num and how broad and Etc is still a\nmatter of debate but\nwhen somebody is training specifically\nfor hypertrophy assuming they are\ngetting enough protein from quality\nsources in their other meals\nand assuming that their overall\nmacronutrient intake and caloric intake\nis high enough that is they have enough\nof a caloric Surplus that they have the\nthe raw materials for\nfor hypertrophy\nwhat do you like to see people ingest at\nsome point post-workout in order to\nfacilitate muscle protein synthesis and\nrecovery and this could include\nnutrition and supplementation or if you\nwant to divide those answers out feel\nfree to do so of course yeah okay great\nso a ton of work came out of Don\nLayman's lab it was actually a Lane's\nMentor as well as Stu Phillips at\nMcMaster so a ton of work there and we\ncan answer a number of things here so\nLane's numbers that he recommended uh\nalso known as about a gram of protein\nper pound of body weight it's a great\nstart now once you slide below per pound\nright one gram per pound right in\nearlier which is also making sure\nbecause we're changing units here uh it\nwas 1.6 grams per kilogram of body\nweight all the way up to I think it was\n2.4 but maybe a size 2.7 yeah grams of\nprotein per kilogram of body weight so\n2.2 in that unit would be the same thing\nso 200 grams per kilogram is the same as\none gram per pound right so depending on\nwhich where you're listening at to this\nat one of those may be easier than the\nother for you if you start getting below\nthat number\nnow you do start running into questions\nof protein quality protein type and\nprotein timing this is one of the\nreasons why I actually fully agree with\nLane is just get that number higher than\nyou think and then all those other\nvariables don't matter if that number is\nlow then you need to start paying\nattention to a bunch of other stuff\nyou've added now complexity to your\nprogram things you got to pay attention\nto just stay high and it doesn't matter\nand so you can just leave a lot of those\nthings off the table\nthat seems to be fairly clear in the\nwork of some of this gentlemen I just\nmentioned that as long as you get to\nthat total number the question about\ntiming and types and quality it seems to\nmatter a lot less in fact uh Stu's\nrecent work in non-animal-based proteins\nit really showed that to be fairly clear\nthat those are quite effective assuming\ntotal protein intake is high enough the\namount of leucine and other amino acids\nin those actual proteins matter less if\nthe total threshold is just super high\nso just do that and you're fine now the\nother caveat we have to say here is\ntiming of macronutrients is seems to be\nsomewhat Irrelevant for protein but that\nis not the case for carbohydrates so\nthat timing does matter replenishment of\nmuscle glycogen is very specific and you\nwant to make sure that that is around a\nlot if you're doing either maintaining\ntraining quality or you're sliding into\nendurance type of work and so nutrient\ntiming does matter with carbohydrates\nmaybe less so with protein and certainly\nless so with protein if the total\nprotein ingestion is high enough so um\nit depends on what we're going after in\nterms of a training goal and where we\nwant to get with all these things in\ngeneral the way that we like to think\nabout this is\nif you're doing a strength type of work\nwhere you're truly targeting that then a\none-to-one post exercise protein to\ncarbohydrate ratio is generally what\nwe're going to go after so this would be\nsomething like 35 grams of protein and\n35 grams of carbohydrate it doesn't have\nto be post it can be pre or my favorite\nis actually mid or post but somewhere in\nthat range especially if you're training\nin the morning and you have not consumed\nanything prior to your workout and\nthat's not necessarily eating in the\nmiddle of the workout that's drinking\ncalories yeah yeah it's going to be able\nto see someone eating a sandwich on uh\nin the gym although I'm sure it's\nhappened yeah so one to one is that like\nsort of standard number here\num if you're going to do sort of more of\na really hard conditioning workout that\nnumber slides up to something like three\nor even four to one which would be\ncarbohydrate to protein ratio so if we\nwant to stay at 35 grams of protein\nwe're going to go maybe as high as like\n100 or 140 grams of carbohydrate again\ndepending on what type of of training\nwe're sort of doing if you're going to\ndo a little bit of a combination then\nyou like a little bit of strength a\nlittle bit of conditioning and kind of a\nstandard workout which is probably\nsomething that a lot of people will do\nthen you maybe want to go to something\nlike two to one so you know 35 grams of\nprotein 60 70 grams of carbohydrate and\nthose are kind of just like rough\nnumbers that you can go by\nand for Pure hypertrophy training would\nyou like to see people ingest some\ncarbohydrate post-training for Pure\nhypertrophy training\nI want to see that as many of those\nnutrients around the training is\ngenerally possible now again I might\nchange my mind when our fasting study\ncomes out but as it stands now\nthere is no advantage to not fueling\naround the training and there are some\nknown and some other potential\nadvantages to fueling so I just see no\nreason to not do it\num in fact\nmost people are generally going to do\nbetter now this is not science this is\njust my coaching experience and this is\nwith our athletes and all of our\nnon-athletes that we've worked with and\ndo work with they're just going to be\nbetter spreading those meals out\ngenerally throughout the day and they're\ngoing to be better if they have those\nnutrients either pre-mid or post and so\nthey're going to get even for my Purge\nfee they're going to get something like\nthat one three to one ratio of carbs to\nprotein\npersonal preference some people don't\nlike to eat before they train some\npeople have to eat before they train\nsome people can't you know put in food\nin their belly immediately after work\naround that you can you can play based\non personal preference but we want that\nfueling in there because we want to\nmaximize the potential growth and we\nwant to just get a jump start on\nrecovery because we're going to be\ntraining again pretty soon\nsupplementation is a huge topic and one\nthat we will go into in great depth in a\nsoon to occur episode but if you had to\npick one supplement that can benefit\nmost everybody if not everybody yeah\nfor their training directed toward\nstrength power and hypertrophy what\nwould that supplement be and how would\nyou like to see people use it meaning\nhow much should they take and when\nshould they take it sure if you don't\ncount protein and carbohydrates as\nsupplements they technically are but\nwe'll just walk out of it right sorry I\nI should be more specific I'm not\nreferring to a non-food form\num protein and carbohydrates so powdered\nprotein and part of powdered\ncarbohydrate Etc\num technically are supplements they're\nhighly processed but they're um but I'm\nnot including that I'm I'm referring to\num non-macronutrient type supplements\nyeah does testosterone count\num well in the context of this\ndiscussion it's uh testosterone that\npeople are manufacturing themselves ah\nokay the cheating kind the endogenous\nkind no\num I mean creatine is the answer here\nwithout question it is the most well\nstudied it is the most effective and its\nuh benefits are robust meaning they're\ngoing to confer positive adaptations\nacross multiple physiological domains\nand we can certainly have a very long\nchat about some of the interesting\nthings that people in fact we just had\num during candel\num on our Barbershop podcast and he went\ninto extensive detail about all the\nbenefits of creatine that people have no\nidea about including things like bone\nmineral density you asked about that\nearlier creatine is actually fairly\neffective for that let alone the thing\nthe benefit in things like cognitive\nfunction decision making memory\num the work that that's being done there\nfor\nneurological disorders\num depression a whole host of things\nthat that creatine is being studied for\nsome of those studies show a lot of\nbenefits some of it show maybe a little\nbit some none but there's just a lot of\nthings creatine can do so when we could\ntalk about Muscle Recovery or muscle\nhypertrophy\num that's where the bulk of the research\nis and it and it's very effective in\nterms of\ntype creatine monohydrate is still the\nbest one and that's just because it has\nthe largest evidence base you can maybe\nmake some arguments for some other types\nbut you're really going to reach\nsaturation pretty quickly within a\nmatter of weeks and there add a dosage\nof anywhere between like three to six\ngrams per day now five grams is the very\nstandard number we give reality is I\nchange that number based on size that's\njust the honest truth\num if you're 225 pounds you're not going\nto get the same dosage of creatine as\n125 pound girl that's just like this is\nnot what we're going to do so we may\nslide that number down a little bit\ncloser to three for the the smaller girl\nboy it doesn't matter it's just female\nphysical size if you're one of our 275\nor 330 pound offensive right tackles in\nthe NFL you're not going to get the same\ndosage as everybody else so that number\nis going to go up to seven eight nine\nmaybe even 10 grams a day I'm there so\nthat's just kind of the scale in general\nif you wanted an easy answer five grams\nis the standard taken after training the\ntiming doesn't matter totally irrelevant\ntake it in the morning of breakfast take\nit at night take it anytime you want\ntake it pre we tend to put it in a lot\nof people's workout\num shakes just to make sure they get it\nin throughout the day but the timing is\nirrelevant great well thank you
