    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are\ndiscussing fertility.\nWe will discuss male fertility\nand female fertility.\nAnd I should mention that\ntoday's discussion is not just\nfor people who are seeking\nto conceive children\nor who want to know how their\nchildren were conceived,\nbut it's really for everybody.\nAnd I say that because it\nis the story of all of us.\nAll of us are here\nbecause a specialized set\nof cells, called germ cells--\nthat is the sperm and the egg.\nAnd I'll make it very\nclear why they're called\ngerm cells a little bit later.\nIt has nothing to\ndo with infection.\nBut it's because a sperm cell\nand an egg cell arrived at one\nanother, either in vivo-- inside\nof our mother-- or in vitro--\nso-called in vitro\nfertilization-- and then\nwe're implanted into our\nmother and became us.\nAnd so understanding\nthe process of how\nthe egg cell and the\nsperm cell came to be\nis really the key\nto understanding\nhow that fertilization\nprocess came to be.\nNow, I know\neveryone's thinking, I\nknow how fertilization occurs.\nIt occurs through sexual\nintercourse and so on.\nAnd we'll talk a\nlittle bit about that.\nBut I promise you\nthat if you understand\nthe menstrual cycle--\nand the menstrual cycle\nin today's conversation\ncan best be thought of as\na biological cycle that\noccurs in females that allows\nthe potential for fertilization\nby the sperm, because\nthat's really what it is,\nand it's a beautifully\norchestrated process\nthat I'll describe to you.\nAnd I should say, all people,\nmales and females, should\nreally understand how the\nmenstrual cycle works,\nhow it impacts\nfertilization, but also\nhow it impacts the brain and\nbody, behavior, psychology,\net cetera.\nAnd we'll also talk\nabout spermatogenesis,\nhow sperm cells come to\nbe and how they arrive--\nthat is, how they\nswim to the egg--\nand the incredible interplay\nbetween the biology\nof the sperm and the\nbiology of the egg\nleads to this incredible thing\nthat we call embryogenesis\nand the birth of the\nchild and, of course,\nthe development of that child\ninto an infant, a toddler,\nan adolescent, a\nteen, and an adult.\nToday's discussion,\nagain, is not just\nfor those of you that are\nseeking to have children.\nAnd I say that because\nwhen you look at the data,\nyou look at the literature\non longevity and vitality,\ntwo themes in biology that\noftentimes people lump together\nbut aren't always the\nsame-- for instance,\nthere are a lot\nof things that we\ncan do to increase our\nvitality that actually\ncan harm our longevity.\nBut there are a subset of\nbiological rules and mechanisms\nthat, when aligned,\nallow us to maximize both\nour vitality and our longevity.\nAnd I think it's fair to say\nthat all of those mechanisms\nand tools are housed\nin the discussion\naround maximizing fertility.\nAnd that's true whether or\nnot you're male or female.\nIn other words, if\nyou want children\nor if you don't, if you\nalready have children\nor if you don't, understanding\nhow fertility and fertilization\noccurs in the\nbrain and body will\nallow you to maximize your\nvitality and longevity.\nAnd of course,\ntoday's discussion\nwill provide an\nunderstanding of the biology\nand many actionable tools that\nwill also help you conceive\nchildren, if that's your wish.\nSo of course, as is\ncharacteristic of this podcast,\nwe will discuss\nscience-based tools,\nincluding behavioral tools, both\nthe dos and the don'ts, and we\nwill discuss nutrition-based\ntools and supplementation-based\ntools and some other practices,\nincluding things like\nacupuncture, which have quite\ngood data to support them\nin terms of improving fertility.\nAnd we will discuss why those\ncertain practices can work.\nAnd we will discuss\nprescription drugs\nthat your doctor can prescribe\nto you if, for instance, you\nhave a deficit at the\nlevel of hormone production\nor neurotransmitter production\nat the level of the brain\nor the pituitary gland--\nI'll explain what all of\nthose things are soon--\nor the gonads, the ovary and\nthe testes in females and males\nrespectively.\nAgain, by the end\nof today's episode,\nyou will have a lot of knowledge\nand actionable tools related\nto maximizing\nfertility, and you will\nhave a lot of knowledge and\nactionable tools related\nto maximizing vitality\nand longevity.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor\nis Maui Nui Meats.\nMaui Nui Meats, I\ncan confidently say,\nare the most nutrient-dense and\ndelicious red meat available.\nMaui Nui he spent\nnearly a decade\nbuilding a USDA-certified\nwild harvesting system\nto help balance invasive\ndeer populations\non the island of Maui.\nThe solution they built\nturns the proliferation\nof an invasive species\ninto a wide range\nof nutrient-dense products, from\nfresh butcher cuts and organ\nmeats to bone broth,\njerky, and even pet treats.\nTheir bone broth has\nan unmatched 25 grams\nof protein per 100 calories.\nI've talked before\non this podcast\nand I've had several expert\nguests come on this podcast\nto talk about the fact\nthat most people should aim\nto get 1 gram of quality\nprotein per pound\nof body weight per day\nin order to maximize\ntheir health, tissue repair,\nwhich includes brain tissue\nrepair, and, if you're an active\nexerciser, to support recovery\nfrom exercise.\nMaui Nui Meats have an\nincredible quality protein\nto calorie ratio.\nAnd I mentioned the bone broth.\nI should also mention that their\nground meats and their venison\nsteaks are absolutely\ndelicious, and their jerky\nis absolutely terrific.\nIn fact, it's the only jerky\nthat I've eaten consistently\nthat I happen to like\nconsistently over time.\nIf you'd like to try\nMaui Nui Venison,\ngo to\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's\nmauinuivenison.com/huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep tracking capacity.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout the fact that sleep\nis the fundamental layer\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nNow, one of the key things for\ngetting a great night's sleep\nevery single night is to\noptimize the temperature\nof your sleeping environment.\nPut simply, in order to fall\nasleep and stay deeply asleep,\nyour body temperature needs to\ndrop by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nAnd waking up, on\nthe other hand,\ninvolves a heating of your\nbody by about 1 to 3 degrees.\nWith Eight Sleep, you\ncan tune the temperature\nof your mattress\ncover or mattress\nto be cooler or\nhotter, depending on\nwhether or not you tend to\nrun too hot or too cold,\nand you can even vary\nit across the night\nso that you can access\nthe best deep sleep early\nin the night, the so-called\nREM sleep, rapid eye movement\nsleep, that's more pronounced\nin the later half of the night\nand in doing so really\nget your sleep optimized,\nnot just in terms of duration\nbut in terms of quality\nand the overall\narchitecture of your sleep.\nThis has a profound influence\non your alertness, focus, mood,\nand many other important\nfactors throughout the day.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can

supplements,\nand yet many, many people\nderive tremendous benefit\nfrom proper supplementation.\nI would count myself\nin that group.\nThere are excellent supplements\nfor improving the depth\nand quality of sleep,\nfor improving focus,\nand for improving energy\nand for hormone optimization\nand many other factors related\nto our mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nWe've partnered with\nMomentous Supplements\nfor three important reasons.\nFirst of all,\nMomentous supplements\nare of the very highest quality.\nSecond of all, they\nship internationally,\nand we know that\nmany of you reside\noutside of the United States.\nAnd third, they focus on\nsingle ingredient formulations.\nThis is very important.\nThere is a place for blends.\nBut in most cases, if you're\ngoing to develop a supplement\nprotocol, you want it to be\nsingle-ingredient formulations\nso that you can adjust the\ndosages of different things\naccording to what works and\ndoesn't work for you, which\nis essentially impossible\nto do if you are using\nmulti-ingredient formulations.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take\nand that we've discussed here\non the Huberman Lab

fertility.\nAnd in doing so, let's take\na step back from this word\n\"fertility\" and ask, what is\nfertility and fertilization\nreally all about?\nWell, the obvious answer is that\nit's about producing offspring.\nBut more importantly, it's\nabout producing offspring\nthat contain the genetic\ncomponents of both parents\nand indeed contain half of\nthe genes from one parent\nand half of the genes\nfrom another parent.\nNow, there are two general\ntypes of cells in the body.\nThe most common types\nof cells in the body\nare called somatic cells.\nSo these would be all\nthe cells in your body\nexcept the egg in females\nand the sperm in males.\nThe egg in females\nand the sperm males\nare part of what's\ncalled the germline.\nAnd again, it has nothing\nto do with infection.\nIt's just that the cells of the\ngermline have genes that cannot\nbe modified by the behavior\nof the individual that houses\nthose genes.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if I were to tell you that\nby exercising you can improve\nmitochondrial function,\nyou can change hormones\nby reducing stress,\nyou can reduce cortisol\nby hitting puberty,\nfor instance, you\nwill have the secretion of\nhormones that then change\ngene expression in\nother cells, leading\nto the development of\nbody hair, facial hair,\ndeepening the voice,\nbreast growth, et cetera,\nyou'd say, OK, great.\nYeah, that all\nmakes perfect sense.\nBut that's all occurring in\nthe so-called somatic cells.\nThe germ cells or\nthe germline cells--\nthat is, the egg and the sperm--\nare a very unique\nand protected set\nof cells that are generated\nin a particular way\nand whose genetic components are\nnot modifiable by experience.\nAnd when you take a step\nback and you think about it,\nyou say, oh, that's right.\nThere's no reason to\nthink that exercising\nwill make the children that\nyou have not yet had stronger.\nAnd you say, of course not.\nWell, why is that?\nWell, that's because\nthere is a barrier\nbetween the genes of the\ngermline cells and behaviors.\nThey cannot be modified by\nbehaviors and the various\nthings that you do\nin your lifetime.\nNow, I suppose\nthere's an exception\nin the negative direction.\nAnd what I'm referring to\nhere is if you were to, say,\nbe exposed to a chemical\nthat could mutate the DNA\nof your egg or sperm or if you\nwere to fertilize an embryo\nin a certain way or at a certain\nstage of life that it got\nan extra chromosome,\nfor instance--\nwe'll talk about this\na little bit later--\nwell, then, of course,\nyou could end up\nwith offspring\nthat have modified\nDNA that don't faithfully\nrepresent half of the genes\nfrom mom and half of\nthe genes from dad.\nBut that's not the same\nas specific behaviors\nmodifying the genes\nof those cells--\nthe sperm and the egg cells--\nin a way that improves\nthe offspring.\nSo the key first thing\nto understand today\nis that there's a distinction\nbetween somatic cells, which\nis the vast majority\nof cells in your body,\nand the so-called\ngermline cells, which\nare the egg and the sperm.\nThe egg and the sperm are these\nhighly protected populations\nof cells that, in\nfemales, actually come\nto be during embryogenesis.\nSo for all females\nout there, you\ngenerate what today I'm going\nto refer to as a vault of cells.\nYou have a vault of eggs\nthat are your germline.\nThose eggs all contain all\nthe chromosomes of your DNA.\nSo it's going to\nbe-- as most of you\nknow, there are 23 chromosomes,\nand chromosomes exist in pairs.\nSo the way to think about this\nis each pair is one strand,\nand you have 22\nso-called autosomes,\nand then you have\none sex chromosome.\nThe sex chromosome will be\neither X or Y. So in a female,\nthey have two X chromosomes.\nSo in each one of the\neggs that a woman has\nand that she's had\nsince she was an embryo\nand that's contained\nin this vault,\nthose eggs are, of course, going\nto be very immature at birth.\nShe hasn't undergone\npuberty yet.\nAnd certainly, as an embryo,\nshe hasn't undergone puberty.\nAnd those cells are\ngoing to contain\n23 pairs of chromosomes.\nThis is very important--\n23 pairs of chromosomes.\nThe chromosomes are\nessentially the wrapped-up DNA\nthat contains all the\ngenetic information\nto create any cell\ntype in the body\nand actually to create an\nentirely new individual.\nNow, there are 23 pairs of\nchromosomes, 22 of which\nare called autosomes.\nIf that doesn't\nmake sense to you,\njust remember, autosome,\nOK, there's 22 of them.\nAnd then there's one\nso-called sex chromosome.\nThe sex chromosomes are either\nX or Y. But this is a female,\nso she's going to have\n23 pairs of chromosomes,\nand she's going to have two\nX chromosomes for the sex\nchromosomes.\nIf this is already confusing\nto you, don't worry,\nI'll make it very clear how\nthis all relates to fertility\nand how it relates to\nchromosomal segregation\nand a bunch of things that I\nthink maybe you've heard of\nand that perhaps\nwere opaque to you.\nBut I promise to\nmake them clear.\nBut just understand that,\nwithin each of those eggs,\nthey have 23 pairs\nof chromosomes.\nAnd for those of you\nthat like nomenclature,\nI'll tell you that those\ncells are considered diploid.\nThey're called the\ndiploid, and that\nmeans that they have 23\npairs of chromosomes,\nas distinguished\nfrom cells that are\nhaploid where there's only one\nset of those 23 chromosomes.\nSo instead of 23 pairs,\nthere's only 23 chromosomes.\nWe'll come back to haploid\ncells a little bit later.\nSo when a female is born,\nshe has all these eggs\nin the reserve, in\nthis vault, that she'll\nhave for her entire life.\nShe's not going\nto make any more.\nBut they are very,\nvery immature.\nSo when a woman is\nin embryogenesis,\nshe develops these\nvery immature eggs.\nToday we're also going\nto talk about follicles,\nand we will be careful\nto distinguish follicles\nfrom eggs.\nThey're often talked about\ninterchangeably, online\nand elsewhere and even by\nfertility docs and OB/GYNs.\nBut right now we're just talking\nabout the egg cells, the eggs\nthemselves, which are cells.\nNow, the goal of\nfertilization is\nto bring that egg cell\ninto close enough proximity\nthat it can be fertilized\nby a single sperm cell.\nAnd that sperm cell will\nbring 23 chromosomes, as well,\nthat include--\njust as in the female egg, it'll\nhave 22 autosomes and one sex\nchromosome.\nAnd in the male,\nthat sex chromosome\ncan either be an X chromosome,\nwhich then would give rise\nto female offspring, or a\nY chromosome, which would\ngive rise to male offspring.\nAnd today we're not talking\nabout sexual differentiation.\nThat's a topic of a previous\nand yet another future episode.\nBut just to give you a sense\nof how X chromosomes and Y\nchromosomes can\nactually accomplish\nthat sexual differentiation,\nboth of body and brain.\nI'll just mention in two\nsentences that, for instance,\nif there's a Y chromosome as\nopposed to an X chromosome,\nthat Y chromosome contains genes\nthat suppress, for instance,\nthe development of\nfemale genitalia\nand thereby give rise\nto male genitalia.\nSo rather than the\nformation of a clitoris,\nit's the formation of a penis.\nAnd rather than the\nformation of ovaries,\nthe formation of a testes.\nSo that's more directed\ntowards sexual differentiation.\nWe're not going to get\ninto that right now.\nWe'll get into that\nin a future episode.\nBut even if you're\nonly tracking about 10%\nof what I'm saying right now,\nI promise you're doing great.\nIf you're tracking\nmore than 10%, well,\nthen you're doing\nterrifically well,\nbecause the essence of fertility\nand fertilization is to bring\ntogether that haploid cell that\nis the sperm that only has 23\nchromosomes-- but not\npairs of chromosomes\nbecause that's\nthe DNA from dad--\ntogether with the egg,\nwhich, as I told you already,\nhas 23 pairs of chromosomes.\nSo part of the\nfertilization process\nhas to be to get rid of\none half of those 23 pairs\nin the female.\nYou got to get\nrid of it, and you\nhave to get the egg and\nthe sperm in proximity\nso that the egg can\npotentially be fertilized\nby the sperm bringing\nthe DNA, the 23\nsingle strands of\nchromosomes from dad,\ninto a cell that has 23\nsingle strands from mom.\nSo I realize I'm probably being\na little bit repetitive here,\nbut I want everyone\nto understand this\nbecause it really frames up\nfertility and reproduction\nin the proper way.\nWe've got a cell from\nmom, the egg, which\nhas 23 pairs of chromosomes.\nWe need to get rid of\none set of those pairs\nso that there's\nonly 23 chromosomes.\nWe need to get rid of\nhalf of those chromosomes.\nAnd then we need to bring\nthat cell together physically\nwith the sperm cell\nthat contains the 23\nchromosomal strands from dad.\nAnd we need to bring\nthose together so that you\nget 23 chromosomal\npairs from dad\nand 23 chromosomal\npairs from mom.\nAnd in doing so, you\ncreate a cell, which\nthen becomes multiple cells.\nThat's going to be the\ndeveloping embryo that\nhas half the genes from mom\nand half the genes from dad.\nSo I hope that's clear.\nThat is the biological\nlogic, which I realize\nis a bit of a tongue twister.\nBut forgive me.\nIt is the most accurate way\nto describe this process.\nWe're trying to bring\ntogether the 23 single strands\nof chromosomes\nfrom dad and the 23\nsingle strands of chromosomes\nfrom mom into the same cell.\nNow, that requires a\nliteral physical contact\nand pairing of the two cells.\nBut as I mentioned before,\nall these eggs in mom\nare sitting in a vault, and\nthey're very, very immature.\nSo the ovulatory cycle\nand the menstrual cycle\nare really about\nfirst eliminating\nhalf of the chromosomal pairs\nin that 23 sets of chromosomes\nand not getting rid of,\nfor instance, half--\njust going 1 to 11 or 12 to 23.\nThat's not the goal.\nThe goal is to have\nchromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\n6, all the way up to\n23, but only to have\nhalf of the chromosomes there\nand to bring that cell together\nwith the sperm cell,\nphysically, then allow\nthem to fuse and allow\nthe chromosomes from dad\nand the chromosomes from mom\nto fuse within a single cell\nand duplicate into cells that\ncontain half of the chromosomes\nfrom dad and half of the\nchromosomes from mom.\nThat's what the ovulatory\nand menstrual cycle\nare really all about.\nSo when thinking\nabout it that way,\nI'd like to just initiate the\ndiscussion by focusing first\non the female component,\nor the egg component,\nof fertility and fertilization.\nAs I mentioned before, a\nfemale has all the eggs,\nalbeit very immature eggs, that\nshe's going to have at the time\nthat she's born.\nNow, puberty will\nhappen at some point\nand will allow the ovulatory\nand the menstrual cycle\nto commence.\nNow, one question that\nyou perhaps are asking\nis, what controls\nthe onset of puberty?\nAnd there are a number\nof different results,\neach of which could\nbe an entire episode\nof a podcast on its own.\nBut I'll just\nhighlight a few things\nthat we know about the onset\nof menses or menstruation,\nor it's sometimes also\ncalled a menarche.\nOne thing that you'll notice\nabout today's discussion\nis that if you were to take\nany number of your notes\nonline and put them\ninto a search function\nthat you would see a lot\nof different language used\nfor the same thing.\nSo for instance,\nsome people will\ntalk about the egg and the\nfollicle as the same thing,\neven though they are not.\nI'll explain the\ndifference soon.\nSome people will talk about\nmenses or menstruation\nor menarche as the\nexact same thing.\nAnd in fact, they are\nnot the exact same thing,\nbut oftentimes these words\nare used interchangeably.\nI'll do my best today to not\noverload you with nomenclature\nbut rather to use the\nmost commonly used terms\nfor the different aspects of\nfertility and fertilization.\nBut when it comes to\nthe onset of puberty,\nfirst of all, most\nof you have probably\nheard that the\nonset of puberty is\nhappening much\nearlier in females now\nthan it was some years ago.\nAnd in fact, that is the case.\nAnd I'll talk about\nsome statistics related\nto this which are\npretty striking\nbut don't necessarily point\nto anything detrimental.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat something bad is happening.\nWhat do we know for sure?\nWell, we know that\nthere are a number\nof signals that come\nboth through the brain\nand through the body--\nand more likely both-- in order\nto control the onset of puberty\nin females.\nA couple of examples-- the\nfirst is a mechanistic one.\nWe know, for instance,\nthat the entire process\nof the ovulatory menstrual cycle\nis initiated from the brain.\nWe're going to get\ninto this in a lot\nmore detail in a few minutes.\nBut there's a certain number of\nhormones and neurotransmitters\nthat are communicated\nfrom the brain,\na structure called\nthe hypothalamus,\nwhich roughly sits above\nthe roof of your mouth,\nand that communicates\nwith a gland, an endocrine\nor hormone-releasing gland\ncalled the pituitary gland.\nThe pituitary gland looks\nlike a stalk that essentially\nextends out of the brain.\nIt's also located not far\nfrom the roof of your mouth.\nAnd that has two\nsort of small marble\nor grape-sized protrusions,\nthe anterior pituitary\nand the posterior pituitary.\nAnd they release different\nhormones into the bloodstream.\nPuberty is in part\ncontrolled by the fact\nthat, up until\npuberty, there are\nneurons in the\nhypothalamus that release\na neurotransmitter called\nGABA, which is inhibitory,\nand that prevents the\nneurons in the hypothalamus\nfrom releasing a very\nimportant hormone called\ngonadotropin-releasing\nhormone, or GnRH.\nSo the first thing I'd\nreally like everyone\nto know and commit to\nmemory today is very easy--\nGnRH stands for\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone.\nThis comes from\nthe brain and will\ncommunicate to the pituitary\nto release certain hormones.\nPrior to puberty, in\nboth males and females,\nthere are neurons in the brain\nthat are actively suppressing\nthe neurons that release GnRH.\nIt's like no puberty,\nno puberty, no puberty.\nYou can't have puberty.\nYou can't have puberty.\nAnd in fact, those cells are\nreleasing this neurotransmitter\ncalled GABA because\nit's inhibitory.\nIt prevents the firing\nof those neurons.\nSo puberty is\nactively suppressed up\nuntil a certain point.\nIt's also actively suppressed,\nat least in some species and we\nthink at least partially in\nhumans, by the tonic release--\nthat means the ongoing\nrelease, around the clock--\nof a hormone called melatonin.\nLater in life-- in\nfact, after puberty--\nmelatonin will be secreted only\nin the dark phase of each night\nand around the time\nthat one goes to sleep.\nBut in children\nand in particular\nin children prior to\npuberty, melatonin\nis released more\nor less constantly.\nNow, melatonin isn't\nthe only source\nof suppression of puberty.\nIt's also these neural\nmechanisms involving GABA.\nBut it is certainly a\ngreat candidate for one\nof the reasons why\npuberty doesn't generally\ntend to happen at,\nsay, age four age five.\nThat would be very unusual.\nAnother component of\nsuppression of puberty\nis that typically in children\nthey have relatively low body\nfat stores.\nWhy is this important?\nWell, we know that one of\nthe things that can trigger\nthe onset of puberty-- in\nparticular in females--\nis that when enough\nbody fat accumulates,\nthat body fat releases\na hormone called leptin,\nand that hormone leptin\ntravels in the bloodstream,\nacross the blood-brain barrier,\nand goes to the hypothalamus\nand can trigger the\nonset of puberty\nby activating the\nneurons that release\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone.\nSo many people believe that\none of the reasons that puberty\nis happening earlier\nand earlier in females\nis because of the accumulation\nof more body fat at younger\nages than was observed 30 or\n40 and certainly 100 years ago.\nNow, I can already imagine a\nnumber of people are thinking,\noh, this must relate\nto the obesity crisis.\nAnd indeed, there is\na crisis of obesity.\nObesity is something that is\ncausing all sorts of problems\nwith people's health at\nvarious levels, brain and body,\nand that is far\nmore frequent today\nthan it was even 20 years ago.\nSo it is indeed a\ncrisis because it\nhas enormous detrimental\neffects for so many aspects\nof brain and body\nhealth and longevity.\nBut this whole process of\nthinking about body fat\nsignaling leptin to the\nhypothalamus and the onset\nof puberty doesn't\nnecessarily have\nto do with the obesity crisis.\nIt might relate, but it could\nalso relate to, for instance,\nimproved nutrition,\nwhich is allowing body\nfat stores to accumulate maybe\nnot to the level of obesity\nbut to accumulate earlier\nand at younger ages\nin females, which\nis then causing\nearlier puberty in females.\nTo just highlight how\nthat might be possible,\nI want to review some data that\ntalk about the onset of menses,\nmenstruation--\nthat is, puberty--\nin females according to\ncountry and according\nto age over the last\n100 or more years.\nSo what are the\ngeneral trends in terms\nof the onset of\npuberty in females?\nWell, that's an\neasy one to answer.\nOver the last 100 years or\nso, the onset of puberty\nhas been occurring much earlier\nwith each passing decade.\nIt's really an incredible\nset of statistics.\nI will provide a\nlink to these data\nsince I know a number of\nyou are listening and not\njust watching on YouTube.\nThis is from a study in\nwhich the onset of puberty\nhas been analyzed from\nas early as the 1850s--\nin certain countries,\nthere are data on that--\nout to the 1970s and\nin other countries\nstarting at about 1900,\nextending out to about 1990.\nThese are ongoing\ncollections of data.\nBut just to give you a sense\nof how the data are falling out\nin a couple of\ndifferent countries,\njust to give you a flavor--\nbut for those of you listening\nand for those of you watching,\nthe essence of all\nof these findings\nis that puberty is\nhappening much, much earlier\nwith each passing decade.\nSo for instance, in the United\nStates, around 1900 or 1903,\nthe average age of menarche,\nthe onset of puberty, in females\nwas about 14 years old, whereas\nin 1990, the average age is 11.\nSo that's a pretty\nsignificant, we can say,\nacceleration of the\nonset of puberty.\nNow, of course,\nthese are averages.\nSo there will be exceptions.\nThere's a distribution of data.\nToday, still, there will\nbe young females who\nwill undergo puberty at age\n11 or 10 or maybe even 9\nand others who will undergo\npuberty at age 13, 14, maybe\neven 16 or 17.\nHowever, if we look\nat, for instance,\nthe data from Norway, which\ndates back quite far-- they\nhave excellent record-keeping--\nto 1850, what we see\nis that the average age of the\nonset of female puberty in 1850\nin Norway was 17 years\nold, whereas in 1970, it's\n13 years old.\nSo this is a\ndramatic acceleration\nof the onset of puberty.\nAnd you see a similar trend\nin other countries, as well.\nSo if we were to look,\nfor instance, in the UK,\nthey have a smaller data\nset, meaning it only\nextends back to about 1940.\nBut the average age of the onset\nof puberty in the UK in 1940\nwas 13 and 1/2 years old.\nAgain, this is just for females.\nAnd in 1970, it\nwas closer to 13,\nwith a trend towards\ndeclining even further.\nUnfortunately, they\ndidn't continue\nto collect data out to 2022.\nAnd as a final point, if we\nwere to look at, for instance,\nin Germany and Finland,\nthe average onset\nof puberty in 1870 was\n16 and 1/2 years old.\nBy 1940, it was down to\n13 and 1/2 years old.\nSo all of these data have\nborne out over and over again,\nregardless of location in the\nworld, which is important,\nbecause when you start to\nthink about the obesity crisis,\nyou can say, well, that's\nmainly in developed countries,\nbelieve it or not-- or\nperhaps not surprisingly.\nAnd maybe it has to do\nwith the obesity crisis.\nAnd yet I don't think we\ncan conclude that at all.\nSomething is happening, however.\nIt could be increased\nbody fat stores\ndue to overeating and obesity.\nHowever, it could also\nbe-- unrelated to obesity,\nit could be, for\ninstance, improved\nnutrition and the availability\nof quality nutrition, which\ncan signal the\nmaturation of the brain\nand body mechanisms that\ntrigger the onset of puberty,\novulatory cycle,\nand menstruation.\nSo we want to be very careful\nabout leaping to conclusions\nabout what these trends mean,\nbut the trends themselves\nare very, very apparent.\nAnd as a final\npoint, I should also\nmention that there are a\nnumber of different behavioral\nand psychosocial, as they're\ncalled, interactions that\ncan influence puberty as well.\nThis has been most strikingly\nobserved in animals.\nAnd so I don't want\nanyone to be alarmed\nor to leap to any great\nconclusions about the onset\nof timing of puberty in\nhumans, but I'd be remiss\nif I didn't tell you about\na certain result which\nshows that if a young female\nis exposed to the odor--\nnot necessarily the pheromones.\nThere's a distinction between\nodors that we perceive\nand pheromones, which\nare subconscious.\nWe don't actively perceive, but\nthat can impact our biology,\nand pheromones effects in\nhumans are very controversial.\nBut we know, for instance, that\nif you take a female animal--\nand there's some\nevidence from humans\nthat if you take a\nyoung prepubertal female\nand you expose her to the scent\nof a reproductively-competent\nmale for a series of days,\nbut maybe even as short\nas a few hours,\nand she is also not\nregularly being exposed to\nthe scent of her father,\nthat she can undergo\npuberty earlier.\nThat's right.\nThere is something\nabout the odor\nand/or pheromones, or\nperhaps something else, that\noccurs when a young prepubertal\nfemale has a father that she's\nin regular contact with.\nHe wouldn't necessarily have\nto live at home but that\nis around a lot that\nhis smell is registered\nby her biological systems.\nThat-- I don't want\nto say protects\nbecause it kind of skews the\nvalence of the conversation,\nbut that offsets or buffers\nthe otherwise observed effect,\nwhich is that the scent of a\nreproductively-competent male,\nif it's present often enough\nor perhaps intensely enough,\nthat it can trigger the onset\nof puberty in that female.\nIn other words, the scent of\na male that is not the father\nand we think also that is not\nbiologically related to her\ncan trigger earlier\nonset of puberty.\nAnd that effect can at\nleast be partially buffered\nby her being in the\npresence of the scent\nfrom her biological father.\nNow, some of you are\nprobably already leaping\nto conclusions about\nwhat this means.\nShould you not\nallow your daughter\nto be exposed to\nany males who are\nof reproductive age, et cetera?\nThat's certainly\nnot what I'm saying.\nThere's a huge number\nof considerations\nthat go into that\ncalculation for everybody\nand circumstances, et cetera.\nBut the point is that the odors\nof individuals, both related--\nin particular, closely related--\nand non-related individuals,\ncan shape the neural systems\nand the hormone systems that\ncan trigger the onset\nof puberty or suppress\nthe onset of puberty.\nSo whether or not we're\ntalking about onset\nof puberty at this\nage or that age\nand whether or not\nbiologically-related male\nor non-biologically-related\nmale scents around,\net cetera, the thing I\nwant everyone to know\nis that at some point\nduring development,\ntypically nowadays between\nthe ages of 11 and 15\nor so-- again, there's\nvariability there.\nThe suppression of\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone\nreleased from the\nhypothalamus is removed,\nand then\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone\ncan activate cells\nwithin the pituitary.\nAnd if you really\nwant to know, it's\nthe anterior pituitary\nin particular.\nAnd then the anterior\npituitary gland,\nwhich sits at and kind of\nbridges the brain and the body\nbecause it allows the release of\nhormones into the bloodstream,\nthat anterior pituitary\nis going to release\ntwo key hormones that everyone\nshould know the name of\nand what they do.\nAnd when I say everyone,\nI mean males and females\nneed to know about\nthese hormones\nbecause they have an active\nrole in both males and females.\nAnd of course, you\nshould want to know\nand should know about\nthe biology of everyone\non the planet, in my\nopinion, because it tells you\na lot more about\nhumans than if you just\nfocus on your own biology.\nBut those two\nhormones are called\nluteinizing hormone,\nwhich is abbreviated LH,\nand follicle-stimulating\nhormone, which\nis abbreviated FSH.\nSo the simple picture that\nyou need to have in your mind\nis gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone from the brain,\nfrom the hypothalamus\nin particular,\nis causing the\nrelease of luteinizing\nhormone and follicle-stimulating\nhormone, GnRH stimulates\nLH, luteinizing hormone, and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nFSH.\nLH and FSH travel in the blood\nand can access all the cells\nand tissues of the body.\nThis is one of the incredible\nthings about hormones is that\nmany hormones-- and LH and FSH\nare included in this group--\ncan travel into cells,\nand they can actually\nchange the genetic\nexpression of those cells.\nThey can change which\ngenes are turned on\nand which genes are turned off.\nAnd they can also attach to\nthe surface of those cells\nand make those cells take\non different properties.\nSo they can mature those cells.\nSo for instance, a good\nexample of this outside\nof the context we've\nbeen talking about\nis the hormone testosterone\ncan travel to the hair follicle\nand can stimulate changes in the\ngenes of the cells of the hair\nfollicle that can\nmake hair grow.\nA different hormone,\nestrogen, can\ntravel to the cells\nof the breast tissue\nand activate genes that control\nenlargement of the cells\nof the breast tissue.\nProlactin, a different hormone,\ncan travel to the mammary ducts\nand control the production\nand the secretion of milk.\nAnd in males, that can actually\nhappen, in certain cases,\nalthough it's rare.\nBut prolactin can also\ntravel to areas of the brain\nthat control libido,\nfor instance.\nAnd just so you'll\nnever forget it,\nmales' elevated\nlevels of prolactin\nare actually what set\nthe refractory period\nafter ejaculation\nand prevent erection\nfor some period of time.\nSo you'll never\nforget prolactin.\nThe point being that\ndifferent hormones\nhave different effects\non different cells,\ndepending on what\ncells those are.\nEstrogen or estradiol is going\nto have different effects\non the breast tissue\nthan it would on skin,\nalthough as effects on both.\nSimilarly, when LH and\nFSH, luteinizing hormone\nand follicle-stimulating\nhormone, travel in the blood\nto the gonad and the\ngonad is an ovary,\nit will have a certain\nset of consequences.\nAnd when luteinizing hormone\nand follicle-stimulating hormone\ntravel in the blood to\na gonad and that gonad\nhappens to be a teste, then\nit will have a different set\nof biological implications.\nSo let's focus now\non what happens when\nLH and FSH arrive at the ovary.\nAnd let's assume now that we're\ntalking about a female who\nhas already undergone\npuberty, or perhaps we\ncould even frame this in\nthe context of a female who\nis about to undergo puberty.\nFSH and LH are now able to\nbe released because she's\nundergoing puberty.\nBut the same set of\nprocesses, essentially,\nwould occur for any point from\npuberty onward until menopause,\nwhich is the depletion of that\nvault, that ovarian reserve\nof all those immature eggs.\nI'd like to take a brief\nbreak and acknowledge\nour sponsor, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral

of vitamin D3/K2.\nOK, so we're now going\nto talk about ovulation\nand menstruation, and\nlet's just remember\nwhat this is all about.\nThis is all about creating\nthe potential for an egg\nto be fertilized,\nand that egg needs\nto have half of the\nchromosomal pairs, so no pairs,\nbut it's got to have 23\nchromosomes just from mom.\nAnd we need to\nposition that egg so\nthat the egg can\nbe met by the sperm\nand that sperm can\npenetrate that egg\nand donate its 23 individual\nstrands of chromosomes\nto that egg so that you can\nbring together the DNA of dad\nand the DNA of mom.\nSo the obligatory\nmenstrual cycle\noccurs when luteinizing hormone\nand follicle-stimulating\nhormone have been released.\nAnd the\novulatory/menstrual cycle--\nand here I have to kind of\npick what I want to call it.\nI guess to be really accurate,\nwe would just call it\nthe female reproductive cycle,\nbut that includes underneath it\nboth the menstrual cycle,\nas it's sometimes called,\nand the ovulatory cycle.\nSo you decide.\nI'm going to interchangeably\ndiscuss the ovulatory cycle\nand the menstrual cycle.\nThe problem is, when\nyou say menstruation,\npeople often think about\njust the period, the shedding\nof the uterine lining when\nfertilization has not occurred.\nSo if I start saying\novulatory cycle,\njust keep in mind I'm\nreferring to the entire thing.\nNow, this is probably\nalso a good opportunity\nto say that if you heard that\nthe ovulatory/menstrual cycle\nis 28 days long, that's\ntrue in some cases,\nbut that's not always true.\nIt's, on average, 28 days long.\nThere are some females for which\nthe ovulatory cycle will be\nshorter-- it can be\nas short as 21 days--\nand other females for which\nit will be 35 days long.\nShorter than 21 days\nand longer than 35\ndays is rare, although\nit does occur.\nOne of the key things when\nthinking about fertility\nis if you talk to OB/GYNs who\nare focused on fertility, which\nI have in anticipation\nof this episode,\nthey'll tell you\nthat whether or not\nyour cycle is 21 days\nlong or 35 days long\nis not as much of an issue\nnecessarily unless it's\nhappening to become much\nshorter or much longer\nin a kind of erratic way.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho's consistently\nhad 23 day long cycles\nand all of a sudden\nyou're having 30 day long\ncycles, that's not necessarily\nan indication of anything bad.\nBut if it's 21 days one month\nand it's 30 days the next month\nand it's 17 days the next\nmonth or even if it's always\nfalling within that 21\nto 35 day long cycle\nbut it's very variable from\neach month or every other month\nor so, you probably want\nto talk to your OB/GYN\nbecause that could indicate\na number of different things.\nWhich things could it indicate?\nWell, that will become\nclear as I spell out\nthe biology in a\nbit more detail.\nBut this idea that the\nmenstrual cycle/ovulatory cycle\nis always 28 days,\nthat's just false.\nThat's just not true.\nI should also mention that there\nis a common misconception that\nbecause the average menstrual\ncycle is 28 days-- indeed,\nthe average is 28 days--\nand the lunar cycle is 28 days--\nand of course, there\nis a real biology\nto support the\nfact that the lunar\ncycle can't, in fact,\nimpact certain aspects\nof human behavior.\nIt does, and we'll\ntalk about lunar cycles\nin a future episode.\nBut there is zero data\nto support the idea\nthat the menstrual cycle\nand the lunar cycle\nare linked in any\nkind of causal way.\nSorry to break it to you.\nThe lunar cycle and the\ntidal cycles at the ocean\nare definitely linked in ways\nthat are super interesting\nrelated to the tilt of the\nEarth and the pull of gravity\nof different planets, and\nit's an incredible story\ninto itself.\nBut the lunar cycle and\nthe menstrual cycle,\ndespite having some weak\ncorrelation in terms\nof their duration or their\nso-called periodicity--\nno pun intended--\nwell, there's no causal\nrelationship whatsoever\nbetween the lunar cycle\nand the menstrual cycle.\nIf any of you are\naware of any real data\nthat conflicts with\nwhat I just said,\nplease put that in the\ncomment section on YouTube.\nBut this is pretty well\nestablished as far as I know.\nOK, so we need to bring together\nthe so-called haploid contents,\nthe 23 individual strands\nof chromosomes from the egg,\nto a place and a position\nwhere it could potentially\nbe fertilized by the male.\nSo what happens?\nLuteinizing hormone and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone\ntravel to the ovary.\nThese hormones are able\nto access the ovary.\nThere's a lot of blood\nsupply to the ovary.\nAnd FSH and LH\narrive at the ovary.\nThe ovary has this vault,\nthis ovarian reserve\nof immature cells.\nThey reside within what\nare called follicles.\nThe follicles are little\nspherical packages\nthat can potentially provide a\nnice environment for those eggs\nto mature.\nAnd when FSH, in particular,\narrives at the ovary,\na small number of\nthose follicles\nwill split off from the reserve,\nthey will exit the vault,\nand they will\nundergo maturation.\nAnd the key player here is\nfollicle-stimulating hormone.\nAnd the first 14 days of the\nmenstrual/ovulatory cycle\nis referred to as the\nfollicular phase because\nof this relationship between\nFSH triggering the maturation\nof a subset of follicles.\nNow, typically in the\ncontext of a 28 day or so\novulatory/menstrual\ncycle, day one\nis designated as the\nfirst day of the period,\nof the shedding of\nthe uterine lining\nfrom the previous ovulatory\nmenstrual cycle in which\nfertilization did not occur.\nSo day one is when\nthe period initiates.\nIt is days 1 through\n14, approximately--\nbecause here we're\njust considering\nthe average of a 28-day\ncycle, but it could be longer.\nIt could be shorter.\nBut the first half of that cycle\nis the so-called follicular\nphase, FSH, has\ntriggered the departure\nof a subset of these follicles\nthat contain immature eggs.\nAnd it is triggering the\nmaturation of those eggs.\nLuteinizing hormone is\nalso present, but also\nat relatively low levels.\nAnd it's during the first half\nof this ovulatory menstrual\ncycle that the main goal is to\nget those follicles to mature.\nSo inside of those follicles,\nthe egg is developing.\nIt's growing.\nIt's maturing.\nAnd in doing so, it's also\nmaking its own hormones.\nThis, I think, is one of\nthe most elegant aspects\nof the ovulatory menstrual\ncycle that, in a few minutes,\nyou'll learn about something\nwhich still to this day,\neven though I've known about\nthis stuff for decades now\nbecause of my training, still\njust blows my mind that you\nhave one hormone,\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\ntriggering the\nmaturation of some eggs\ninside of some follicles and\nthen those follicles themselves\nmaking another hormone\nthat furthers the process\nand then soon, as you'll learn,\ncreate a hormone to trigger\nthe second half of the process.\nJust a beautiful symphony of\nexpression of different genes\nand different hormones\nto make everything\nwork as optimally as possible.\nSo as these different\nfollicles mature, somehow--\nand we still don't\nknow exactly how--\none of those follicles\ncontaining an egg\ngets selected.\nIt's either because\nit matures the fastest\nor there's something\nabout it that\nis still not\ncompletely understood\nthat allows it to be selected.\nAnd all the other\nfollicles that are maturing\ndegenerate and die.\nAnd they're gone.\nThey don't go back into\nthe ovarian reserve.\nThey are now depleted\nfrom that bank account\nthat is the ovarian reserve.\nThey die off.\nBut that single egg\nthat, keep in mind,\ncontains 23 pairs\nof chromosomes--\nwe haven't gotten rid\nof one half of those 23\nsets of chromosomes yet.\nBut that one will\ncontinue to mature.\nAnd then, at some\npoint, that egg\nwill start to undergo a process\nin which those chromosomes are\npulled apart by\nlittle components\nwithin the egg called spindles.\nThey literally have\na physical pulling\nof the chromosomes apart.\nSo now those 23 pairs are no\nlonger attached to one another\nat the middle like\nthey were before,\nlike two beads of strings--\nor I should say,\n23 short strands\nof beads that were at once\nconnected to one another\nnow are pulled apart\nso that you have\n23 chromosomes on\neach side, but they're\npulled apart from one another.\nSo that diploid\ncell is now starting\nto become a cell in which\nhalf of the chromosomes,\nhalf of those 23\npairs, are physically\npulled away from the others.\nAnd then the egg actually\nstarts to form its own\nwhat we call an\ninvolution of membrane\naround those 23 pairs, one set\nof them, and encapsulates them.\nSo you sort of got\nan egg with two parts\nwhere the two sets\nof chromosomes,\ntwo sets of 23 chromosomes,\nare now separate\nfrom one another\ninside of the egg.\nAnd then one of those actually\ngets ejected from the egg,\nand the name of that\nthing that gets ejected--\nit's sort of like a little\nHubble pod is how I imagine it,\nyou know, from Star Wars or from\nany kind of Space Odyssey movie\nwhere some thing\nis ready to happen.\nA little Hubble pod\nshoots out of the ship.\nWell, that 23 pairs is\nnow ejected from the egg.\nIt's called the polar body.\nAnd that's going to degenerate.\nIt's going to go away.\nAnd in doing so, take the\negg cell, which was once\ndiploid-- it had 23 pairs\nof chromosomes-- and making\nit haploid.\nAnd now what you've got,\nin ideal circumstances,\nis a beautifully pristine\negg that was selected for\nand has 23 single strands\nof chromosomes, 22 autosomes\nand one sex chromosome.\nAnd that sex chromosome is\ngoing to be an X chromosome\nalmost with certainty,\nbecause female--\nmother-- is creating that egg.\nSo then the egg that contains\njust the appropriate 23\nsingle-stranded\nchromosomes is going\nto fuse with the wall of\nthe ovary, and that egg\nwill be released and will\ntravel into the Fallopian tube.\nNow, we'll get back to\nthat egg in a few moments.\nBut that process, which\nrepresents the first half\nof the ovulatory\nmenstrual cycle, again,\nwas triggered by FSH and to\nsome extent luteinizing hormone.\nBut it is the ongoing maturation\nof that egg which also causes\nthe production of estrogen,\nwhich allows that whole process\nto occur.\nAnd you could say, why?\nWell, the answer to the\nwhy is a very important\nbiological principle\nthat we are going\nto return to in a number of\ndifferent contexts today,\nboth as reference to\nfemale and male fertility.\nAnd the principle is a\nso-called negative feedback.\nSo when estrogen is present\nat relatively low levels\nin females in the\novary, as it is\nduring the development of these\neggs, some of that estrogen,\nof course, is going\nto exit the ovary.\nIt's going to go\ninto the bloodstream.\nAnd it's going to travel\nback to the pituitary.\nNow, the pituitary\ncan release things\nlike follicle-stimulating\nhormone and luteinizing\nhormone.\nBut the way I'd\nlike you to think\nabout the pituitary for\nsake of feedback loops\nis that it's sort of\nlike a thermometer\nthat you would put into a pool,\nlike a backyard pool, that\nis attached to the heater.\nAnd for instance, if you were\nto put a thermometer into a pool\nthat you would like\nto keep at 70 degrees\nand the temperature of\nthat pool is 60 degrees,\nwell, then that\nthermometer ought\nto trigger some\nsort of mechanism\nwhere the pool would heat\nup until the temperature\nof the pool hit 70\ndegrees, and then it\nshould trigger that thermometer\nto turn off the heating system.\nThat's kind of a\nnegative feedback\nsystem that would keep\nthe temperature more\nor less correct.\nThat's a lot of the way that\nthe system's related to estrogen\nand also testosterone and\nthese different things\nlike luteinizing hormone and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone\nwork as well.\nTypically, when the level\nof a hormone is too high,\nthen it shuts down\nthe production\nof the hormones that would\ntrigger further production\nof that hormone.\nI know that's a mouthful.\nIt's a lot to think about.\nAnd some of you are\nprobably thinking, whoa,\nI'm getting dizzy\nnow with biology.\nBut I promise you, you\ncan understand this.\nIn females, when estrogen\nis relatively low--\nbut not zero but\nis relatively low\nduring that first follicular\nhalf of the ovulatory cycle--\nit actually triggers negative\nfeedback on LH and FSH\nso that not too\nmuch is produced.\nBut then just\nprior to ovulation,\nthe levels of estrogen and the\nlevels of some other hormones\nfrom those eggs--\nyou have the eggs producing\nestrogen themselves--\ngets high enough\nthat it actually\ntriggers a positive feedback\nloop on the pituitary.\nSo the pituitary is\nessentially observing\nthe amount of estrogen in\nthe bloodstream produced\nby the ovary, and the\namount of estrogen\ntowards the end of the second\nhalf of the menstrual cycle\nhas increased and triggers\na positive feedback loop.\nIt triggers the pituitary\nto release more FSH and LH,\nand that helps trigger\novulation, that deployment\nor the release of that\none mature proper selected\negg that's haploid with the 23\nindividual pairs of chromosomes\ninto the Fallopian tube.\nSo let's just back up\nreally quickly and just\nkind of summarize\nwhat's happened.\nGonadotropin-releasing\nhormone from the hypothalamus\ntriggers the release of\nfollicle-stimulating hormone\nand luteinizing hormone.\nThat travels to the\novary-- triggers\nthe release of a subset\nof immature follicles\nwith immature eggs.\nThose immature follicles\nand immature eggs\nstart to mature,\nstart to grow because\nof the presence of\nfollicle-stimulating hormone.\nThe growth of those eggs\nthemselves increases estrogen.\nAs the estrogen starts to\naccumulate in the environment,\nsome of that travels\nback to the pituitary.\nAnd when levels of estrogen\narriving at the pituitary\nare relatively\nlow, the pituitary\nsays, oh, we don't\nneed to release\nany more follicle-stimulating\nand luteinizing hormone.\nHowever, at some point\njust prior to ovulation,\nenough estrogen has been\nproduced by that one\nsingle selected\nmature egg and some\nof the other follicles around\nit that were maturing but then\nsince died off that the estrogen\ntriggers a positive feedback\nloop.\nThe pituitary says,\nOK, and releases\nmore follicle-stimulating\nhormone\nand luteinizing hormone.\nAnd bam, the egg, which has\nthe proper genetic components,\nsets off out of the ovary\nand into the Fallopian tube.\nSo-called ovulation has begun.\nThat itself, what\nI just described,\nconstitutes the first half of\nthe ovulatory/menstrual cycle,\nwhich we call the\nfollicular phase.\nAnd it's marked by the presence\nof FSH and some other things,\nbut we can really think\nabout it as marked by FSH\nfrom the pituitary and by\nestrogen, or estradiol, made\nwithin the ovary.\nThen comes the second half of\nthe ovulatory/menstrual cycle,\nwhich I personally think is\none of the coolest mechanisms\nin all of biology,\nwhich is that--\nremember the\nfollicle that housed\nthat one egg that\nwas the selected\negg that became the mature egg?\nAnd that follicle, which\nno longer contains the egg\nbecause the egg took\noff and ovulated,\nis called the corpus luteum.\nAnd the corpus luteum starts\nmaking three hormones, which\ninclude estradiol, I\nthink called inhibin,\nbut the most important hormone,\nthe one that you really\nneed to know about,\nis that it starts\nproducing very high\nlevels of progesterone.\nProgesterone levels\nstart to increase\nabout the time of\novulation, although just\nprior to ovulation.\nAnd over the next second\nhalf of the ovulatory cycle--\nso about 14 days if\nit's a 28-day cycle,\na little bit longer or\na little bit shorter,\ndepending on the\nlength of cycle.\nLevels of progesterone\nin the second half\nof the ovulatory cycle are\ngoing to increase by 1,400 fold\ncompared to what they\nwere in the first half\nof the ovulatory cycle.\nSo again, if we\nwere to characterize\nthe menstrual/ovulatory cycle\nin broad strokes, what we would\nsay is that FSH\nand estrogen mark\nthe initial part the first half,\nthe so-called follicular phase,\nand that the estrogen and\nFSH set in motion ovulation,\nand they prime the\nsystem for the production\nof a corpus luteum, which\nproduces progesterone.\nAnd the second\nhalf of all of this\nis called the luteal phase.\nThe second half of the\novulatory/menstrual cycle\nis the luteal phase\nbecause of corpus luteum,\nthis otherwise discarded tissue\nthat produces progesterone.\nWhat does progesterone do?\nWell, progesterone impacts\nthe uterine lining,\nso-called endometrium\nor the lining,\nthe mucous lining of the uterus\nwhere that egg that's ovulated\nis potentially going to\nimplant if it's fertilized.\nAnd so in a kind of\nperfect way-- or I\nshould say, in a\nseemingly perfect way--\nthe egg is off on its way.\nIt might get fertilized.\nThe remnants of the compartment\nthat let go of that egg\nproduce a hormone that then\nprepares the endometrial lining\nof the uterus for the potential\nimplantation of that egg.\nIt's basically making the\nbed for the fertilized egg\nto potentially embed in,\nto implant in, and then\nachieve all the nourishment that\nit needs to grow, eventually,\ninto a healthy embryo and child.\nJust an amazing set of\nbiological mechanisms,\nif you ask me, because\nwhat you're observing here\nis an incredible\neconomy of function\nwhereby the same\ncellular components that\nare producing the egg,\nwell, some of them\nare being discarded,\nbut they're not being\ndiscarded without purpose.\nThey're being\ndiscarded in a way that\ntriggers the onset of\nhormonal expression\nthat then prepares\nthe fertilized\negg to be in an enriched\nenvironment in which it\ncan thrive.\nNow, I realize that\nwas a lot of detail.\nBut we have a couple\nof key themes.\nWe've got the\nhypothalamus, GnRH.\nWe've got the pituitary\nwith LH and FSH,\nand those hormones\ntravel to the ovary.\nThe ovary has eggs in a\nvault, basically immature eggs\nin a vault. Some of those\nare activated by the presence\nof FSH and LH each month.\nAnd one of those eggs will\nbe selected and will ovulate.\nThe remnants of the\nfollicle and egg\nthat are not selected, the\nchromosomes that you don't need\ndisappear in the polar body.\nAnd the corpus luteum gives\nrise to progesterone and sets\nin motion the second half of\nthe ovulatory menstrual cycle,\nwhich is the luteal phase,\nwhich is essentially\nthe potential for\nthat fertilized egg\nto embed in a nice,\nnourishing environment.\nAnd of course, we\nshould all be thinking,\nif the egg is fertilized\nand then it lays down\nin the nice, comfy\nuterine lining\nthat's been prepared\nby progesterone\nin the corpus luteum, well,\nthen everything's fine and good.\nBut what if fertilization\ndoesn't occur?\nWell, we all know what happens\nif fertilization doesn't occur.\nIf fertilization does not\noccur for whatever reason,\nthat uterine lining\nis going to shed.\nAnd that's actually what's\nreferred to as the period.\nIt's the actual removal--\nor the departure, rather--\nof the thickened\nendometrium lining\nof the uterus when\nfertilization has not occurred.\nAnd of course, if\nthat happens, we\nneed another ovulatory\nmenstrual cycle.\nSo how does that happen?\nWell, the hormone inhibin is\nalso made by the corpus luteum\nand doesn't go quite as high\nas the hormone progesterone.\nBut it kind of tracks that\nincrease in progesterone\nthat occurs in the second\nhalf of the ovulatory cycle.\nBut then, if fertilization\ndoes not occur,\ninhibin levels start to drop.\nAnd what I haven't told\nyou is what inhibin does.\nInhibin, in concert with\nother hormones like estrogen,\nfeed back to the hypothalamus\nand prevent the further release\nof follicle-stimulating hormone\nand luteinizing hormone.\nIf you have an egg that gets\nfertilized and can implant,\nwell, then you don't\nwant more eggs to mature.\nYou want to hold on to\nthe ones in the vault.\nYou don't want them to mature.\nAnd hormones like\ninhibin and, again,\nworking with other\nhormones are going\nto prevent the secretion\nof things like FSH and LH.\nNow, typically, people are not\ngetting pregnant every month.\nIn fact, that's not possible.\nAnd part of the reason\nit's not possible\nis that if the\nfertilized egg implants,\nthere are a number of\ndifferent hormone cascades\nthat shut down the production\nof things like GnRH, FSH, and LH\nin ways that prevent further\nmaturation of follicles\nand a follicular phase.\nBut in the instance where\nfertilization doesn't occur\nand menstruation occurs--\nand I should mention that\nthe duration of menstruation,\nthe actual bleeding,\ntypically is anywhere from one\nto five days.\nThe, quote, unquote,\n\"heaviness,\"\nthe lightness or heaviness of\nthat bleeding will depend on--\nyou guessed it-- the amount of\nprogesterone that is secreted\nfrom the corpus luteum.\nThat's one of the\nkey players there.\nAnd if menstruation occurs,\nwell, then inhibin levels\nalso drop.\nProgesterone levels also drop.\nAnd when that occurs,\nthere's a positive feedback\nsignal up at the level\nof the pituitary.\nThe pituitary\nliterally can register\nhow much inhibin and\nprogesterone and estrogen\nis present in the bloodstream.\nAnd if those levels are\nsufficiently low, well,\nthen GnRH gets secreted again,\nFSH gets secreted again,\nand LH gets secreted again.\nAnd the first half\nthe follicular phase\nof the menstrual cycle\ninitiates all over again.\nIt's hard to overstate how\nbeautifully orchestrated\nthis entire system is--\nThe number of feedback loops\nand feed-forward loops.\nI think if you can just\ngenerally understand\nthat the first half of the\nmenstrual/ovulatory cycle\nis marked by the maturation\nof the follicles and FSH\nand that the second\nhalf is marked\nby the accumulation\nof progesterone\nand the thickening\nof the uterine lining\nshould fertilization\nand implantation occur,\nI think that you will\ncertainly understand\nthe female reproductive\ncycle better than most people\nout there.\nIt will also help you\nunderstand a number of things\nthat are sometimes associated\nwith the female reproductive\ncycle.\nFor instance, there\nare data showing\nthat, in many, not all, but\nin many women, in the four\nto five days prior to\novulation, there is\na dramatic increase in libido.\nThat dramatic\nincrease in libido is\ntriggered by a number of\nthings, but some of those things\ninclude the spike\nin FSH that occurs,\nthe spike in LH that occurs,\nand some associated increases\nin androgens, things like\nDHEA and testosterone,\nwhich, just as in males\ncan be related to libido,\nin females trigger libido.\nYou can imagine why this would\nbe an effective mechanism\nto have in place in females if\nthe goal, as it were, certainly\nof the egg, perhaps not\nof the woman as a whole,\nbut if the goal is to\nfertilize the egg--\nso increases in\nlibido just prior\nto the onset of ovulation.\nThere's also been a lot\nof discussion and interest\nand, frankly, data\nexploring the malaise\nthat it can occur\nat certain portions\nof the menstrual cycle.\nAnd there's a lot of\nmisconception about this.\nA lot of people have focused\non the malaise that can occur\naround the time of bleeding.\nBut there are\nactually stronger data\nto support the fact that some,\nagain, some, not all women\nexperience a kind of\nmalaise sometimes associated\nwith anxiety, sometimes not,\nthat's associated with the mid\nto second half of\nthe luteal phase\nof the\novulatory/menstrual cycle.\nAnd that, despite what\npeople commonly think,\nis not associated with\nelevated levels of estrogen.\nIt's actually associated with\nthe depletion in estrogen\nlevels that can occur\nduring certain portions\nof that second half\nof the luteal phase\nof the menstrual cycle.\nSo again, this is\nhighly variable.\nFor some people, they\nmight not experience\nany malaise at any point\nduring their menstrual cycle.\nOther individuals\nalso, for instance,\nmight not experience any\nvariation in their libido\nat any point during\ntheir menstrual cycle.\nAgain, highly\nvariable, and yet there\nare some statistically\nsignificant trends\nthat have been\nobserved that tracked\nvery specific\nhormonal components\nwithin the menstrual cycle.\nAgain, this will all\nbe very contextual.\nAnd of course, this can play out\nin a number of different ways.\nSo for instance, some women\nexperience very heightened\nlevels of sensitivity\nto caffeine\nat certain portions of\ntheir menstrual cycle.\nOther women experience\nmore cramping than others\nat different portions of\ntheir menstrual cycle.\nTremendous variation from\nindividual to individual.\nOne of the--\nI view it as an advantage.\nBut one of the things that\nmany females can really do\nand experience because they have\ncycles that occur every month\nthat are fairly dramatic\nin terms of their levels\nof hormones-- so for instance,\na more than 1,000-fold increase\nin progesterone during the\nluteal phase of the menstrual\ncycle and, I should\nalso mention,\na 200-fold increase in estrogen\nduring the period just prior\nto ovulation.\nThat's why they always say\nestrogen primes progesterone.\nThat's what you learn in\nkind of basic endocrinology\nwhen you're learning\nthe menstrual cycle.\nEstrogen in the first half\nof the menstrual cycle\nprimes progesterone\nin the second half\nof the\novulatory/menstrual cycle.\nWell, those estrogen increases\njust prior to ovulation\nare in part responsible for\nthe increases in libido.\nBut it's also the presence of\nincreased androgen just prior\nto ovulation.\nSo there's a lot of\ncomplex interplay.\nI think what we will\ndo is we will reserve\nthe discussion about\nlibido, per se,\nand some of the\nother aspects related\nto sexual\ndifferentiation that we\nwere talking about earlier\nfor a future episode.\nBut hopefully now\nyou have in mind\nwhat the ovulatory/menstrual\ncycle is.\nIt is a signal from the\nbrain, from the hypothalamus,\nwhich then triggers a\nsignal from the pituitary,\nan endocrine gland, which then\nsignals the release of hormones\nthat travel to the\novary and that control\ntwo things, maturation of eggs\nand the identification of one\negg in particular and then\npreparation of the milieu,\nthe environment in which\nthat fertilized egg could\npotentially land and mature\ninto a healthy embryo and child.\nSo if you have that\nframed up in your mind\nand even if you just\nextracted maybe 10% to 15%\nof the hormones and\ndifferent aspects\nthat I described up until now,\nI would consider you far more\nknowledgeable about this entire\nprocess than 99% of people\nout there, certainly not\nthe OB/GYNs and urologists,\nbut the 99% of\nindividuals out there.\nIt also frames up for\nus the second half\nof this whole story about\nfertility and fertilization,\nwhich is the generation of sperm\nand how the sperm eventually\narrive at the egg and how\ncertain sperm are selected\nto potentially\nfertilize that egg,\nwhereas others never\nreally stand a chance.\nSo next we're going\nto talk about sperm.\nWe're going to talk\nabout what sperm are,\nwhere they are generated,\nand how they are generated,\nand how they need to\ntravel both within the male\nand within the female in\norder to allow fertilization\nto potentially occur.\nI'd like to take a\nbrief break and thank\nour sponsor, InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your

confess, it was\na lot of information\nwith a lot of\nbiological nomenclature.\nBut I promise you that\nmany of those same themes\nand indeed the same\nnames and nomenclature\nwill show up in the\ndiscussion that we're\ngoing to have now, which is\nabout the generation of sperm.\nNow, sperm are similar\nto eggs in the sense\nthat they are part\nof the germline.\nThey are these protected\ncells, protected in the sense\nthat the activities\nof an individual\nare not going to change the\ngenetic makeup of those cells.\nNow, again, there are\ninstances in which\nmutagens, such as\nchemicals, could disrupt\nthe genomes of the germ\ncells in males, just\nas it could in females.\nBut in general, the\nactivities, the things\nthat we do, the\nexperiences we have,\ndoesn't tend to change\nthe genome of those cells.\nHowever, there are a lot\nof lifestyle factors--\ndos and don'ts, nutrition and\nsupplements and prescription\ndrugs, et cetera-- that can\nindeed modify the quality\nof the sperm.\nAnd we'll talk about\nwhat sperm quality means.\nBut the point is that the sperm\ncell, much like the egg cell,\nare both germline cells.\nThey are not like somatic cells.\nThey are unique populations.\nAnd let's just remember what\nthe job of the sperm cell is.\nThe job of the sperm cell is\nto deliver the genetic material\nfrom the father and to do that\nin the form of a haploid cell.\nSo that means 23\nchromosomes, 22 autosomes,\none so-called sex chromosome--\nagain, not sex the verb,\nat least not in this case.\nSex, the verb, is\na discussion we're\ngoing to have in a few\nminutes, but sex the noun.\nThe sex chromosome can either\nbe an X chromosome or a Y\nchromosome.\nSo 22 autosomes and\nthen one sex chromosome\nis going to be contained\nwithin the sperm\nbecause it's a haploid\ncell, not a diploid cell.\nRemember, the egg was diploid,\nthen it became haploid.\nThe sperm cells\nare cells that are\ncreated through the\ndivision of other cells.\nBut after that division occurs\nthrough a process called\nmeiosis, the sperm cell is\ngoing to contain 23 chromosomes,\nconsisting of 22 autosomes\nand one sex chromosome.\nAnd the sperm that manages\nto deposit its DNA contents\ninto the egg, to\nfertilize the egg,\nwill either have an X\nsex chromosome or a Y sex\nchromosome.\nAnd the Y sex\nchromosome has a number\nof different genes on\nthat chromosome that\nwill suppress, for\ninstance, the development\nof the female reproductive axis.\nOne good example would be the\nMüllerian-inhibiting hormone,\nor MIH.\nThe gene for\nMüllerian-inhibiting hormone,\nwhich is a hormone that prevents\nthe formation of the Müllerian\nducts, which is part of the\nfemale reproductive structure,\nwell, that gene controls the\nprevention of the development\nof the female genitalia\nand in doing so promotes\nthe development of\nthe male genitalia.\nAnd there are other\nexamples of genes\nthat are on the Y\nchromosome that give you\na what we call male phenotype.\nYou have genotype and phenotype.\nBy the way, in case you\nhaven't heard this in a while\nfrom your high school biology--\nor if you never heard\nit, no big deal--\nkaryotype is the\ncomplement of chromosome--\nXX or XY.\nAnd there are\nindividuals out there\nthat are XXY or XYY, a\ndiscussion for our episode\non sex differentiation.\nThat's karyotype with a K.\nThen there's genotype, which\nare the genes that you have.\nAnd then there's phenotype,\nspelled P-H-E-N-O-T-Y-P-E,\nphenotype.\nAnd the phenotype\nis how the genes,\nwhich then code for RNA,\nwhich code for protein,\nhow those are expressed in\nterms of things like eye color.\nSo eye color is a phenotype.\nHeight is a phenotype.\nHair color is a phenotype.\nSo you have karyotype,\ngenotype, and phenotype.\nWell, what we need to do is\nwe need to bring together\nthat sperm, which is\nhaploidd it contains those 23\nchromosomal strandes--\nwith either an X or\na Y. Sex chromosome\nis the 23rd chromosome.\nWe need to get that\ncell to the egg.\nAnd so when we talk about\nspermatogenesis, of course,\nwe are talking about the\ngeneration of sperm cells.\nBut what we're really talking\nabout is the generation\nof cells whose job is to deliver\nthe genetic material from dad\nto the egg within the female\nin a way that increases\nthe probability that not only\nwill that egg be fertilized\nbut that it will progress in\na healthy way with each set\nof chromosomes from\nmom and from dad--\neach set of 23\nchromosomes, that is--\nwill progress in a healthy way,\nwill implant in a healthy way,\nand will maintain and grow in a\nhealthy way to a healthy embryo\nand child and eventually adult.\nThat's the job of the sperm.\nSo as we talk about\nspermatogenesis,\nlet's just remember that\nand why they're there\nin the first place.\nNow, a few things about\nsperm that are interesting,\nbesides the fact\nthat they're haploid\nand besides the fact that,\nas you all know, they swim.\nThey have a head and a tail.\nThey actually have a head,\na mid region, and a tail,\nand that mid region turns\nout to be very important.\nIt's something we'll come\nback to again and again.\nThat mid region is really\nkey for the ability for sperm\nto engage in forward\nprogression to swim forward.\nIt involves the activity\nof mitochondria,\nwhich are involved in\ngeneration of ATP, which\nis involved in all aspects\nof energy and all cells.\nBut let's just remember that\nthe sperm are swimming cells.\nAnd in order to create\na really good swimmer\nor set of swimmers, you\nneed a couple of things.\nFirst of all, within the testes\nis where the sperm develop.\nAnd unlike in females\nand unlike in the ovary,\nthere's no vault of sperm.\nThe sperm are continually\nbeing generated.\nIt takes about 60\ndays for sperm to be\nborn from their parent cells--\nbecause cells actually\ngive rise to other cells,\nthat's the it works-- to be\nborn from their parent cells\nand then matured to\nthe point where they\ncan be a really good swimmer.\nNow, that doesn't mean\nthat a bunch of sperm\nare made on day one, and then\n60 days later, all those sperm\nare deployed in the\nform of ejaculate,\nand then the cycle\nstarts over again.\nSo it's a little different than\nthe ovulatory menstrual cycle.\nRather, at any given point\nin time-- like right now,\nif you have testes, you have\nsome sperm in your testes that\nare immature and cannot swim,\ncannot deliver those contents\nto--\nthose genetic contents,\nrather-- to the female egg.\nAnd you have some\nsperm that are mature,\nand you very likely have\nsome sperm that are so mature\nthat they are dying off\nor that they're dead.\nAlmost certainly, also,\nregardless of your age,\nyou have some sperm that are\nhealthier than others, that are\nbetter swimmers than others.\nThis is just the way\nthe system works.\nNow, the process\nof spermatogenesis\ninvolves a couple of things,\nbut a lot of the players\nare the same as the\nprocess of developing\nthe so-called oocyte,\nthe immature egg.\nWe've got GnRH from\nthe hypothalamus.\nThat's going to be a player.\nWe have FSH,\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nalthough the name's a little\nbit of a misnomer in the context\nof spermatogenesis, because in\nthe context of spermatogenesis,\nthere is no follicle.\nWhat we're really\ntalking about is\nFSH for stimulating the\nmaturation of the sperm cell,\nso not egg follicle\nbut sperm cell.\nBut we still have GnRH,\nFSH, LH, and rather\nthan the ovary being the\ntarget of those hormones,\nit's going to be the testes.\nSo most everybody should know\nthat the testes and the ovaries\nare the so-called gonads.\nThe testes, of course,\nreside outside of the body.\nThere are instances\nwhere the testes fail\nto descend during development.\nCertainly, if the\ntestes don't descend\non time, that's something that\ndoctors need to be made aware\nof, the pediatrician\nshould be made aware of,\nbecause that can\nprevent fertility.\nWhy would that be?\nWell, it turns out\nthat the testes\nreside outside the\nbody in the scrotum\nbecause the\ntemperature conditions\nunder which\nspermatogenesis can occur\nand under which healthy\nsperm can be maintained\nare very restricted and is\napproximately 2 degrees cooler\nthan the rest of the body.\nThis is very important.\nI think this is something that\nused to be discussed a lot more\nbut isn't discussed\nso much these days.\nBut keeping the\ntestes cool enough--\ndoesn't necessarily mean keeping\nthem cold, although there\nis a place for\nusing cold exposure,\ndeliberate cold\nexposure, to improve\nsperm quality and\nnumber and perhaps even\ntestosterone levels.\nWe'll talk about that\na little bit later.\nBut keeping the\ntestes about 2 degrees\ncooler than the rest of\nthe body is absolutely key.\nIf sperm get too hot, they die.\nAnd if spermatocytes, the\ncells that give rise to sperm,\nget too warm, well, then\noftentimes the sperm\nthat develop are not\nhealthy, not healthy\nin a number of ways.\nEither they can't engage in\nfast forward progression--\nthat is, swimming-- or\nthey will lack the ability\nto deposit their DNA\ncontents within the egg.\nSo again, whatever is\ncontained in the ejaculate\nis going to be a mixture of\ndifferent sperm qualities.\nAnd sperm of different ages will\nimpact the quality, but also\nthe temperature under which\nthose sperm developed is\ngoing to impact their quality.\nAnd so we're going to get\ninto tools a little bit\nlater, as I mentioned, but just\nto give you a simple takeaway.\nIf you are hoping to conceive\nin the next 90 days--\nthe spermatogenesis\ncycle take 60 days,\nbut then the sperm actually have\nto migrate from the testicle\ninto the so-called epididymis,\nwhich is a related structure,\nand then into the\nvas deferens and then\ninto the urethra, where it\ncan be part of the ejaculate.\nIn order for sperm to\ndo all that properly,\nundergo that maturation and\nthen exit in ejaculate in a way\nthat's healthy or that\nthe sperm is healthy,\nif you plan to conceive children\nor to try and conceive children\nin the next 90 days, you\ndefinitely want to avoid\nexposing your testicles--\nthat is, your scrotum--\nto elevated temperatures.\nSo that means definitely\navoiding hot tubs,\ndefinitely avoiding hot baths.\nNow, a brief hot bath\nor hot tub or hot shower\nisn't going to be a\nproblem, although if you're\nreally interested in conceiving,\nI would avoid hot tubs\nand hot baths as\nmuch as possible.\nHot showers are probably fine.\nBut if you're going to go\ninto a sauna, for instance,\nyou might want to\nrethink that decision.\nAnd if you do decide\nto, you almost certainly\nwould want to bring a cold\npack in that you could-- well,\nhopefully put some material\nbetween the cold pack\nand the scrotum so you\ndon't get a cold burn.\nBut put something there, but\nkeep the scrotal tissue cool.\nKeep it cold to cool because\nheat exposure can really\nmutate and disrupt\nthe developing sperm,\nand it can kill sperm.\nAnd so, again, that would\nbe for an entire 90 days\nleading up to your\nattempts to conceive.\nAgain, we'll get into more tools\nlater, but a number of people\nalso have probably heard\nof the boxers versus briefs\ncontroversy, I guess it is,\nor whether or not people call\nit going commando with no\nunderwear of any kind-- boxers,\nbriefs, briefs, or\notherwise rather.\nIt turns out that the data\non that point to the fact\nthat there isn't really a big\ndifference in terms of sperm\nquality if people\nwear boxers or briefs\nor don't wear anything under\ntheir jeans or shorts at all.\nThe scrotum has the ability to\nmove the testicles far enough\naway from the body in\norder to achieve lower\ntemperatures if it needs to.\nIt achieves that\nthrough a muscle\ncalled the cremaster\nmuscle, which\nis a really interesting\nmuscle, believe it or not.\nI was reading up on the\nbiology of the cremaster\nmuscle, something\nI never thought\nI'd spend too much time on but\nthat I ended up spending far\ntoo much time reading up about.\nAnd it's really fascinating.\nWhat you have is a muscle\nthat is a smooth muscle\ntissue, unlike skeletal muscle,\nwhich is striated muscle,\nthat is temperature dependent.\nSo it has certain nerve endings,\nand it has certain receptors\non it that allow it to\nrespond to local temperature\nand then to relax in\norder to essentially let\nthe testicles to descend further\nfrom the body or to contract\nand bring the testicles\ncloser to the body\nin order to try and maintain\nthe optimal temperature range.\nAnd it turns out the cremaster\nmuscle can achieve that\nwhether or not people are\nwearing boxers or briefs.\nAlthough it stands to\nreason that any kind of--\nthere's no other name for\nit-- undergarments-- you know,\nI don't know why that word\njust seems kind of antiquated--\nbut undergarment that allows\nsome movement of the scrotum\nand the testicles should\nbe sufficient to allow\nthese temperature variations to\noccur and keep things in range.\nThat said, a little bit later,\nwe'll go into some detail,\nreally--\nbecause it's\nimportant-- as to why,\nfor instance, if you are\nsomebody who has big thighs,\nbelieve it or not,\nthat it actually\ncan lower sperm count\nsubstantially, whether or not\nthe big thighs occur\nbecause you're very muscular\nor the big thighs occur\nbecause you are overweight.\nIt can increase the temperature.\nIf you're sitting\na lot, increases\nscrotal temperature, for sure.\nAnd there are some other things\nthat can increase scrotal\ntemperature, seat heaters\nin cars, for instance--\nterrible idea, just terrible\nidea if you're hoping\nto conceive in the near future--\nand again, hot tub,\nthings of that sort.\nSo temperature modulation\nof spermatogenesis and sperm\nquality and function is key.\nThat relates a little\nbit more to tools.\nBut what happens?\nHow does the actual\nsperm develop?\nWell, contained\nwithin the testicle,\nyou have the cells, the\nso-called spermatogonia,\nwhich differentiate into\nso-called spermatocytes.\nYou don't have to\nremember all this.\nAnd the spermatocytes undergo\nthis process of meiosis.\nMeiosis is a form of\ncell division, which\nreduces the chromosome number to\nthose 23 individual strands as\nopposed to pairs.\nSo it makes them haploid\nas opposed to diploid.\nVery, very important for reasons\nthat we talked about earlier.\nAnd the meiosis process in\nthese primordial sperm cells,\nthese immature sperm cells, is\nsimilar to the meiosis process\nthat occurs in eggs when\nthe chromosomes segregate in\nthat it involves these\nspindle-like structures\nwithin the cell.\nNow, why do I keep\nbringing up the spindles?\nWell, it turns out\nthat the function\nof the spindle in\nthe egg and the sperm\nis heavily dependent on\nmitochondrial function.\nAnd later when we get into tools\nfor improving egg and sperm\nquality, you're going to\nhear about a lot of tools\nfor improving mitochondria.\nAnd it's not just\nbecause the mitochondria\nare involved in energy-demanding\naspects of cell biology.\nBut it's also because the\nmitochondria in this context\nare very, very important for\nthe removal of or the separation\nof one set of\nchromosomes to give you\nthese two sets of haploid\ncells, the egg and the sperm.\nAnd this is so important because\nmany failures at fertilization,\nmany failures at implantation,\nmany, many miscarriages,\nand many birth defects that\ndo survive after birth that\nare very detrimental, such as\ntrisomies and things like that,\noccur because the spindles\ndon't effectively pull apart\nthe chromosomes in\ntypically the egg,\nbut it can also\noccur in the sperm.\nSo the spindles and the\nfact that mitochondria\nare rich on the spindle are\nvery important for generating\nthese haploid sperm--\nagain, 23 individual strands\nof chromosomes.\nThat's occurring\ninside of the testes.\nSo there's not as much\nlong-distance migration\nof the spermatocytes\nand the sperm cells\nas there is the\negg just when you\nthink about the overall\narchitecture of the uterus\nand the Fallopian tubes\ncompared to the testicles,\nbut there's still\na lot of movement.\nSo within the\ntesticle, if you were\nto look at the testicle\nin cross-section--\nand I prefer to call\nit that rather than cut\nthe testicle in half.\nAny time you talk about\nanatomy, you actually\ntalk about slicing things.\nThat's what you would do with\na cadaver is what I teach\nand we do in my\nlaboratory and, frankly,\nin biological laboratories\nall over the place.\nBut when you talk about it, you\ntalk about if you were to take\na visual cross-section\nthrough the testicle,\nwhat you would find is that\nthere are a lot of different\nlittle tubes, a lot of\nducts, D-U-C-T-S, ducts.\nThose are pathways.\nAnd the main ducts that are\nimportant for this discussion\nare called the\nseminiferous tubules.\nSo it's a mesh-like\nor network structure\nof tubes in the testicle.\nAnd the immature sperm sit\non a little compartment\nalong the edge of those tubes.\nAnd as they mature, they\nmove towards the center\nof those tubes.\nAnd then when they\nare mature enough,\nthose sperm cells actually drop\ninto the hollow of the tube,\nand then can travel\nthrough those tubes\nto a structure that's along\nthe side of the testicle called\nthe epididymis.\nThe epididymis, again,\nis a series of ducts.\nAnd then the epididymis\nconverges with something\ncalled the vas deferens.\nI think in high school,\nwe all remember this\nby thinking about it's\nthe vast difference.\nI don't know who\ncame up with that.\nI think it was a\nyoung girl sitting\nto the left of me that\nwas like, oh, it's\nlike the vast difference.\nI never forgot that.\nI don't know.\nMaybe it was the topic matter.\nMaybe it was her.\nMaybe it was some\ncombination of the two.\nBut in any case, the sperm\ngo from the seminiferous\ntubules to the\nepididymis and then\nto the vas deferens and then\nare contained in the ejaculate,\nalong with seminal fluid.\nNow, the seminal fluid\nis the carrier fluid\nfor the sperm themselves.\nThis is important\nbecause it turns out\nthat a lot of things that can\nboth negatively or positively\nimpact the quality of the\nsperm relates not just\nto the sperm cells themselves\nand the temperature\nof the environment that\nthey were matured in,\nbut also to the semen quality.\nFor instance, if you are a heavy\ndrinker, if you are a smoker,\nor if you are a regular\nuser of cannabis,\nespecially if you smoke\ncannabis or vape cannabis,\nyou create a lot of\nreactive oxygen species\nthat disrupt the chemistry\nof the seminal fluid, which\ndisrupts the sperm cells.\nSo it's not a direct action\nalways on the sperm cell\nitself, although it can be.\nSo for instance, in the form\nof smoked tobacco or cannabis,\nthere are a lot of\ncarcinogens and mutagens\nthat actually mutate the DNA,\ncan cause DNA fragmentation,\nand debilitate sperm.\nBut there are also a lot of\nthings created by smoking\nin particular, regardless\nof what's being smoked,\nthat can create elevated\nreactive oxygen species\nand disrupt the seminal fluid\nthat the sperm are contained\nin in the so-called\nejaculate, the semen.\nNow, this will also become a\nrelevant conversation later\nwhen we briefly talk\nabout vasectomies.\nVasectomies are\nliterally a cutting\nof the vas deferens, which\nleads to a situation,\nprovided the surgery\nwas done correctly,\nwhere men can still achieve\nall the other aspects\nof intercourse.\nThey can still achieve erection.\nThey can still achieve orgasm.\nThey can still ejaculate.\nBut when they ejaculate, the\nseminal fluid is released,\nbut there are no sperm contained\nwithin the seminal fluid.\nAnd it turns out\nthat vasectomies\nare a very effective\nform of birth control.\nAnd they always check\nto see if zero sperm\nand confirm that\nzero sperm are being\nreleased in the ejaculate.\nThey are reversible.\nAnd that is, vasectomies are\nreversible, but not always.\nThere are a subset of cases\nwhere it's not reversible,\nin which case if people\nstill want to have children,\nyou have to go in and actually\nsurgically extract sperm\nfrom the testicles.\nBut it's a process in which\nthe vas deferens is altered\nor severed in a way that\nthe sperm can't actually\nexit the testicle.\nThey can get into the\nepididymis, usually,\nbut not into the vas deferens\nand so on and so forth.\nSo if you've ever wondered\nwhat a vasectomy is,\nthat's what a vasectomy is.\nAnd I mentioned vasectomy\nnow because it illustrates\nthe difference between the\nseminal fluid, the semen,\nand the sperm that\nthe semen contain.\nSo 60 days to generate the\nsperm, another two weeks\nor so for the sperm to travel\nthrough the various ducts\nto the point where they can\nbe contained in the ejaculate.\nLet's talk about the\nsperm cells themselves.\nThe sperm cells, again,\nhave these 23 pairs\nof single-strand chromosomes.\nThey're haploid.\nThey have either an X\nor a Y sex chromosome\nas the 23rd so-called\nsex chromosome.\nAnd as we all know,\nthey have a head.\nThe head tends to be\noval in most cases.\nThe head contains very\nimportant enzymes and proteins\nthat are designed to fuse\nwith the much larger egg\nand to actually take the\nmembrane of the sperm cell\nand combine to actually mesh\nwith the egg cell's membrane\nand then deliver the genetic\ncontents to the egg cell,\nin other words, to\nfertilize the egg cell.\nNow, just behind the head is a\nregion called the mid region.\nThat mid region is a\nslightly thickened region.\nAnd here, of course, I'm\ntalking about healthy sperm cell\nmorphology.\nMorphology simply means shape.\nA mid region-- that\nmid region has a bunch\nof things related\nto cell motility\nand to the forward\nprogression of the cells.\nFirst of all, it is chock a\nblock full of mitochondria.\nIn fact, if you\nwere to look just\nbehind the head of the\nsperm, what you'd see\nis that it is completely\nsurrounded by mitochondria.\nThere are mitochondria elsewhere\nin the cell, but most of them\nare contained in this\nmid region compartment\njust behind the\nhead of the sperm.\nAnd that thick region is where\nthe tail movement of the sperm,\nthe flagellation back and forth,\nis actually generated from.\nMuch like if you were to\nhold a rope, like a battle\nrope in the gym, and you\nwere to whip the battle rope,\nthe whip at the\none end of the rope\nis what allows for the sort\nof-- let's just call it\nwhat it is-- the\ncurves in the rope,\nthe oscillations, the\nrising and falling\nof the rope all the\nway out to the end.\nIt is the force of the whip\nright at that end that with\nthe battle rope you're\ndoing with your hand--\nand with the sperm, that is\noccurring just behind the head\nof the sperm--\nthat is actually going\nto dictate how fast\nand how well that\nsperm can swim.\nAnd indeed, the sperm\nhas to swim very far.\nHow far?\nWell, on a relative scale--\nand again, these are estimations\nbecause they're going to be--\nhow should we say?\nThere will be differences\nin the distance\nfrom the head of the penis and\nwhere the ejaculation occurs\nto the cervix, depending\non the relative size\nof the vaginal canal\nand the penis that\ndelivers the ejaculate\nto the vaginal canal.\nBut once the sperm arrive\nat the cervix, which\nis at the back of\nthe vaginal canal\njust at the opening\nto the uterus,\nonce the sperm arrive\nthere, the distance\nfrom the cervix to\nthe egg, of course,\nwill vary depending\non where that egg is\nin its ovulatory\ntrajectory, its pathway.\nBut it is akin, if\nyou scale for size,\nto the distance between Los\nAngeles and San Francisco,\nwhich is many, many\nhundreds of miles.\nSo those sperm have\nto swim very far.\nNow, of course, if the sperm are\ndelivered in the vaginal canal\nsomewhat further away, they\nwill have further to go.\nIf they're delivered right\nat the cervical opening,\nthey will have less far to go.\nThe very effective swimming\nsperm swim very fast.\nSo they are able to\naccomplish that distance\nin just a few days.\nAnd this relates to\na discussion that we\nwill get into in\na lot more detail\nlater as to how often couples\nshould have intercourse\nif they're trying to conceive.\nMany people might think,\nwell, it's every day.\nHowever, the more frequent\nthe ejaculation, the lower\nthe concentration of\nsperm in each ejaculate.\nSo this is not a\ndiscussion about how often\nto have intercourse depending\nto your preferences,\nfor pleasure or bonding\nor whatever reason.\nThis is a discussion about\nhow often to have intercourse\nin order to optimize the\nprobability of fertilization\nof the egg.\nThere's some general rules\nthat, of course, come to mind,\nwhich is ejaculations close\nto ovulation-- both before,\nduring, or sometimes after--\nare obviously advantageous.\nBut you will also hear\nOB/GYNs and urologist\nsuggesting intercourse\nevery other day\nleading up to the\nday of ovulation,\nstarting about three\nto four days out\nfrom the day of ovulation.\nSo we got a little\nbit sidetracked,\nalbeit I think appropriately so,\nin focusing on fertilization.\nBut what we were talking\nabout right up until the point\nof that is the anatomy\nof the sperm itself,\nwhich is the head,\nthe mid region that\ncontains all those\nmitochondria, and then the tail.\nNow, what we haven't discussed\nis the actual generation\nof the sperm.\nSo if you're a male\nor if you're a female,\nI think it's really\nimportant to understand\nhow spermatogenesis works.\nSpermatogenesis works\nin much in the same way\nthat the generation and\nmaturation of eggs work,\nalthough, as I\nmentioned before, it's\ngoing to occur ongoing\nthroughout the cycle\nof the male's life\nafter puberty.\nWe already talked about\npuberty, and I'll just\ncover this in two\nor three sentences\nas it relates to males.\nAnd it's essentially\nthe same thing.\nThe hypothalamus, up until\nthe point of puberty,\nis providing suppression\nof the release\nof gonadotropin-releasing\nhormone.\nThen some biological clock,\nwhich is still not clearly\nunderstood-- it's probably not\nleptin coming from body fat.\nAgain, unlike in the female,\nit's probably not leptin\ncoming from body fat.\nBut some other signal\narrives to the hypothalamus,\nremoves that\ninhibition, and GnRH,\ngonadotropin-releasing\nhormone, is now\nreleased onto the pituitary.\nA bunch of hormones are\ndeployed from the pituitary\nas a consequence.\nThe two most important ones for\nthe context of this discussion\nare follicle-stimulating\nhormone and luteinizing hormone.\nFollicle-stimulating hormone\nand luteinizing hormone\ntravel to the\ntestes, and they're\ngoing to do two main things.\nOne, they're going to trigger\nthe production of testosterone.\nAnd they're going to\ntrigger the production\nof the sperm themselves.\nThey're going to set in\nmotion, for essentially\nthe rest of the life of the\nmale, the production of sperm.\nThey're going to initiate\nthe spermatogenesis cycle,\nand that cycle is\ngoing to be ongoing\nat various stages\nfor different sperm\nfor the rest of the man's life.\nThis is very different than\nthe triggering of development\nof oocytes and eggs in females,\nwhere there's an existing\nvault. That vault can be\ndepleted to the point of zero\nwhere it can't occur again.\nMen can generate sperm\ntheir entire lifetime.\nOf course, there's\na diminishment\nof sperm production in\nvery, very late age,\nsay, 80s and 90s or 100s.\nBut believe it or not, there\nare still sperm being produced.\nThe quality of those\nsperm is another question.\nSo everything we're\ngoing to talk about now\nis essentially puberty onward.\nPrior to that,\ntesticles are present,\nbut they're not\ngenerating sperm.\nEjaculation isn't possible,\nor if it is possible,\nit's very unlikely and\nunusual, and it's not\ngoing to contain sperm.\nEverything we're going\nto talk about now\nis puberty forward, so puberty\nonward to the rest of life.\nAnd luteinizing hormone\nsecreted from the pituitary acts\non the testes and on a\nvery specific cell type\nin the testes called the Leydig\negg cells, or Leydig cells,\nL-E-Y-D-I-G, the Leydig cells.\nThe Leydig cells of the testes\nare what produce testosterone.\nTestosterone is going to\nhave two major effects.\nAnd here I mean really\nmajor because it\nhas many, many hundreds of\neffects on different tissues\nof the body.\nIn fact, that's the definition\nof a hormone, really.\nIt's a substance that acts\nin an endocrine fashion.\nIt can act on the very\ntissue that generated it.\nSo for instance, testosterone\nmade by the Leydig cells\nwithin the testes will\nact on the testes,\nas we'll talk about in a moment.\nBut it can also act\non other tissues.\nIt can act on the\npharynx and larynx\nand deepen the voice, as\nit does during puberty.\nIt can act on the hair follicles\nand generate facial hair.\nIt can act on the musculature\nand generate protein synthesis\nand development of\nmuscle, bone, et\ncetera, all the\nthings we associate\nwith puberty and with\ntestosterone typically.\nRestricting the conversation\nto the effects of testosterone\non the testicle itself\nand on spermatogenesis,\nthe Leydig cells\nmake testosterone.\nAnd keep in mind that\nsome of that testosterone\nwill travel\nelsewhere in the body\nand do its thing\nfor gene expression\nand the more acute effects\nof testosterone on the brain\nincluded.\nBut the testosterone\nwithin the testes\nis at extremely\nhigh concentration.\nIn fact, the concentration of\nintratesticular testosterone\nis at least 100 times higher\nthan the concentration\nof testosterone anywhere\nelse in the body,\neven though it's being secreted\ninto the rest of the body.\nAnd that's because\nthere are a number\nof different so-called\nbinding proteins and enzymes\nthat sequester the\ntestosterone within the testes.\nSo the Leydig cells are\nmaking testosterone,\nand a lot of that\ntestosterone is acting on\nand is restricted to the testes.\nAnd that turns out to be very\nimportant because testosterone\nwithin the testes\nacts in concert\nwith a different biological\nprogram that starts with FSH,\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nthat also travels to the testes\nand acts on a very specific\nset of cells that are called\nsupporting cells or,\nmore specifically,\nthe Sertoli cells.\nThe Sertoli cells\nare the cells that\ngenerate something called ABP,\nor androgen-binding protein.\nAnd it is the combination of\ntestosterone from the Leydig\ncells and ABP from\nthe Sertoli cells\nthat is necessary\nfor spermatogenesis.\nIt's necessary for\nthose spermatocytes\nto become what will eventually\nbe healthy, mature sperm that\nhave really nice shaped oval\nheads, have a mid region,\nchock a block\nthrough mitochondria,\nand can generate a fast\nwhipping motion of the tail\nto swim from the cervix, or\nup the vagina into the cervix,\nand from the cervix to the\negg to fertilize the egg.\nSo it's really a basic set\nof chemical players that are\ninvolved here and\nso basic, in fact,\nthat if you were to disrupt any\none of these chemical players--\neither the luteinizing\nhormone, the FSH,\nthe testosterone from\nthe Leydig cells,\nor androgen-binding protein--\nyou would observe\npretty marked disruption\nin spermatogenesis or the\nelimination of sperm entirely.\nWe'll get into a few\ndeficits in sperm development\nand sperm number and sperm\nfunction a little bit later.\nBut just keep in mind--\nor I should say, maybe\nsit back and just\nappreciate that the exact\nsame players generate\nfrom the hypothalamus,\nwhich causes luteinizing\nhormone and follicle-stimulating\nhormone released\nfrom the pituitary, which\ntravels to the gonad, which\nin this case is the\ntesticle, which triggers\nthe release of\ntestosterone from Leydig\ncells, which triggers the\naction of the supporting cells,\nthe Sertoli cells, which make\nandrogen-binding protein.\nTestosterone and\nandrogen-binding protein\ncombine and create a\nchemical and actually\na structural milieu in which\nthose little spermatocytes\ncan go from the\nwalls, from literally\nthe walls of the tubes of\nthe seminiferous tubules,\ncan mature into healthy,\nwell-developed sperm,\nand can hop into those\nducts, those little tubes,\nand then head off to the\nepididymis, where they will\nreside-- the epididymis is the\ntissue nearby the testicles\nor surrounding one\nportion of the testicle--\nand then eventually fuse\nwith the vas deferens,\ncan combine with or be\ncontained with, rather,\nthe seminal fluid, and then can\nbe ejaculated via the urethra\ninto the female,\nwhere then they can\nswim very quickly, effectively\nthe distance, for them anyway,\nfrom Los Angeles\nto San Francisco,\nover the course of a very\nshort period of time,\nand fertilize the egg.\nSo that's the process of\nspermatogenesis, the maturation\nof sperm, which is ongoing\nthroughout the lifespan\nfrom puberty onward.\nAnd in doing so, we talked about\nsome of the hormonal elements--\ncoming from the hypothalamus\nand coming from the pituitary,\nand within the testes themselves\nthe Leydig cells, which\nproduce testosterone,\nthe Sertoli cells,\nwhich are the support cells that\nallow spermatogenesis to occur.\nWith that in mind,\nnext I'd like to think\nabout what's actually contained\nin the ejaculate in terms\nof numbers of sperm and\nwhat's really being selected\nfor in terms of the sperm\nthat actually successfully\nfertilizes the egg and\nwhat sorts of elements\ncome into play in dictating\nwhether or not fertilization\nwill or won't occur.\nAnd the major themes that\nwe're going to discuss\nare frequency of\nejaculation, but really\nthat's just kind of a proxy\nfor talking about maximizing\nsperm concentration and quality\nof sperm arriving at the egg--\nbecause, remember, ovulation\nand the menstrual cycle\nare really about creating the\nopportunity for fertilization.\nAnd we are also going\nto talk about how\nthe vaginal duct,\nthe vagina, and\nthe milieu around the cervix\nand some other elements\nwithin the female\nherself contribute to\nand support the sperm in\ntheir journey to the egg\nand in the likelihood that\nthey will fertilize the egg.\nSo really what we need to talk\nabout first is sperm quality.\nAnd we should also probably\ntalk about ejaculate quality,\nbecause, as odd as\nthat theme might seem,\nreally the ejaculate\nquality, which\nhas a number of\ndifferent parameters,\nincluding the number\nof mature sperm\nthat are not so mature that\nthey're swimming slower\nor are dead, but also\nquality of sperm.\nThey have, for\ninstance, one tail.\nIt's not entirely\nuncommon to see sperm\nwith two tails because they\njust didn't form properly\nor sperm that are\nnot moving very much.\nIn fact, sperm motility is\nscored along a scale of 0,\n1, 2, or 3, 3 being the best,\nfast forward progressing.\n0 is not moving at all.\n1, they're actually\ncalled twitchers.\nTwitchers are sperm that\nsort of just twitch in place\nbut don't undergo\nforward progression.\n2 is somewhere in between\n1 and 3, not surprisingly.\nDifferent clinics, different\nOB/GYNs, different urologists\nwill throw out\ndifferent numbers.\nBut in general, it is hoped\nthat more than 50% of the sperm\nshould be motile in some way\nor another, so not scoring a 0,\nbut a 1, or 2, or ideally a 3.\nThe concentration of sperm--\nof course, if it's higher within\nthe ejaculate, the total number\nof sperm per milliliter of\nejaculate, if that's higher,\nthen there's a\nhigher probability\nthat one of those sperm\nwill fertilize the egg.\nOne thing I didn't\nmention before when\ndiscussing the production\nof eggs and ovulation--\nand I probably should\nhave, so I will\nnow-- is that most\noften only one\novary gives rise to\nan ovulating egg.\nIt happens, but it's somewhat\nrare for two mature eggs, one\nfrom each ovary, to be deployed\nduring a single ovulation.\nThere's a name for that when it\noccurs and both are fertilized.\nIt's called fraternal twins.\nIf a single egg--\nthat, of course, comes\nfrom a single ovary--\nis fertilized and\nthe egg splits--\nand that's something that\nhappens further along\nin the process of fertilization\nand differentiation\nof the embryo--\nwell, then what you get\nare identical twins.\nThere are other instances that\nare quite uncommon in which\nyou can get fraternal twins\nthrough other circumstances.\nBut in general, that's\nthe way it works.\nBut essentially what\nhappens is one egg\nfrom one ovary-- that's\nthe most common occurrence.\nThe sperm, once ejaculated\ninto the vaginal duct,\nare going to pass\nthrough the cervix\nand then are going to\nswim toward the egg.\nThe egg could be at\nvarying locations\nalong the female\nreproductive axis.\nNow, this is actually\na very important thing\nand actually gets right down\nto the safety of both the\npotentially developing\nembryo and the mother.\nThere is something referred\nto as ectopic pregnancy,\nand that's when the\npregnancy actually occurs\nwithin the Fallopian tubes.\nSo the precise location\nin which fertilization\nbetween the sperm and the\negg occurs can vary somewhat.\nBut ideally, the fertilized egg\nimplants into the endometrium\nor the endometrial\nlining of the uterus\nand develops there as opposed\nto within the Fallopian tubes,\nwhich is so-called\nectopic pregnancy.\nNow, where the sperm\nand the egg meet exactly\ncan vary, as I mentioned before.\nBut in general, the\nfaster swimming sperm\nand the more far along the\novulatory trajectory the egg\nare, the higher the probability\nof a successful fertilization\nbecause of the proximity\nto the implantation zone\nof the uterus.\nSo basically it's all\na probabilities game.\nIt's a probabilities\ngame related\nto the number of sperm\ncells that encounter the egg\nand where the egg is in\nterms of its ovulatory cycle\nand also its position where\nit is in the ovulatory cycle.\nThe sperm parameters--\nor I should\nsay the semen parameters--\nand ejaculate parameters\nthat most clinicians\nwant to see,\nif you were to give\na sperm sample,\nwould be somewhere in excess of\n15 million sperm per milliliter\nof ejaculate.\nNow, there's a lot of\ndiscussion nowadays.\nIt seems to be a very\npopular news theme\nto talk about diminishing\nsperm counts, the idea that 100\nyears ago or maybe even 35 years\nago, the typical male ejaculate\ncontained 100 million\nsperm per milliliter,\nand nowadays it's down\nto 15 to 20 or 50.\nAnd indeed, sperm counts\ndo seem to be declining.\nAnd the exact reasons\nfor that are not clear.\nI confess I'm a little bit\nreluctant to talk about this\nbecause there have been a lot\nof back and forth discussions\nabout the safety of EMFs,\nof electromagnetic fields,\nand it's not exactly what\nwe're talking about here.\nBut there are some\nexcellent data\ncontained in\nmeta-analyses and reviews\nthat I will provide links\nto and that we'll talk about\nin more detail in a\nminute that correlate\nthe advent of smartphones\nand in particular caring\nof smartphones in the pocket\nwith diminishing sperm counts.\nAlthough there are certain\nto be other factors that\ncan explain diminishing\nsperm counts as well.\nDr. Shanna Swan, for instance,\nhas done beautiful work\ndescribing how the\nphthalates and the BPAs\nand so-called\nendocrine disruptors\nmight be disrupting\nsome of the milieu\nof the seminiferous tubules.\nSo this would be reductions in\ntestosterone and/or disruptions\nto the Sertoli cells and\nandrogen-binding protein\nbrought about by endocrine\ndisruptors such as phthalates\ncontained in pesticides and\ncontained on printed receipts\nand things of that sort.\nThere are some data\nthat that is negatively\nimpacting sperm counts.\nHow much so is still debatable.\nThere are also quite\ngood data pointing\nto the fact that\nboth the heat-related\nand the non-heat-related impact\nof smartphones and laptops\ncontained on the lap are\nimpacting sperm count\nand in a negative way.\nAgain, there's going to\nbe tremendous variation\nin the concentration\nof sperm from one\nindividual to the next.\nIt will vary according to age\nand a number of other factors\nthat we'll talk about\na little bit later.\nBut in general, if somebody\nis wishing to conceive,\nthen clinicians like to\nsee a ejaculate volume\nof more than 2 milliliters.\nSo ejaculate volume\ncan be anywhere\nfrom 1.5 to 5 milliliters.\nAnd that will\nstrongly be determined\nby how frequent\nejaculation is occurring.\nThere's a lot that goes\ninto evaluating the quality\nof ejaculate and sperm.\nBut basically these huge\nvariations that are observed\nof anywhere from 15 million\nsperm per milliliter\nor, in some males who are not\nproducing sperm for whatever\nreason-- we'll talk about\nthose reasons in a little bit--\nas low as 5 million\nsperm per milliliter,\nall the way up to\n100 or maybe even\n200 million sperm\nper milliliter.\nHuge variation-- the cause\nof which is not always clear\nbut is certainly\ndetermined in part\nby the frequency of ejaculation.\nSo because there are\nso many variables\nimpacting why one male\nversus another male or even\nthe same male\nacross the lifespan\nmight have variations in\nhis concentration of sperm\nwithin the ejaculate, let's talk\nfor a second about frequency\nof ejaculation as it relates\nto the goal of fertility,\nper se, because that's really\nwhat today's episode is all\nabout.\nSo what I'd like\nto talk about next\nis how people can\nincrease the probability\nof a successful\nfertilization, focusing\nboth on the components\nfrom the male side\nand from the female side.\nAnd I'm mainly going to couch\nthis discussion in the context\nof the so-called natural\nmethod of sexual intercourse\nand ejaculation in\nvivo, within the female.\nBut I will also touch\non some parallel themes\nas it relates to\nin-vitro fertilization\nand intrauterine insemination.\nSo the idea here is that\nwe want the maximum number\nof high-quality sperm--\nthat is, rapidly forward,\nmotile sperm that are of\nthe correct morphology--\nthat is, shape.\nThat's going to require\na lot of mitochondria\nin the mid region,\na well-shaped head--\nso it's going to be\nan oval-shaped head.\nThe tail is going to be a\nsingle tail, not multiple tails.\nThese aren't going to be\nthe twitcher type of--\nor immotile type of sperm that\nare either twitching in place\nor aren't moving forward.\nAll of those\ncomponents are going\nto be essential for\nincreasing the probability\nof fertilization.\nBut of course, there's\nthe female side of it,\ntoo, which is that\novulation occurs\non just one day during the\nmenstrual ovulatory cycle.\nAnd that egg will be\navailable for fertilization\nfor approximately 24 hours.\nNow, keep in mind that\nthe sperm can survive\nwithin the vaginal duct\nand within the area\naround the cervix\nand within the uterus\nand along the female\nreproductive tract for anywhere\nfrom three to five\nor it's even been\ndescribed as up to seven days.\nBut generally, it's going to\nbe about three to five days.\nNow, most women can figure\nout the day of their ovulation\nby counting the total number\nof days of their typical cycle.\nAnd this is where\nit's really useful\nto have a cycle that's of\nmore or less regular duration\nor, rather, of more or\nless regular length.\nSo as we talked about\nearlier, if somebody's cycle\nis 21 days or 25 days and it's\n21 or 25 days consistently\nor even 30 days\nconsistently, that's\ngoing to be a far better\nscenario to favor fertilization\nthan if it's 20 days\none month and then 21\ndays the next month, but then\nsuddenly 30 days and then\nsuddenly 35 days.\nThose varying durations\nof the ovulatory cycle\nmake it very hard,\nobviously, to time\nand understand when\novulation is going to occur.\nSo regular duration\novulatory cycles\nare the ideal circumstance, and\nthey're the ideal circumstance,\nbecause even though\nthe egg is only\navailable for fertilization\nfor a few days,\nthose sperm can survive for\nsome period of time, which\nleads to the issue of\nhow often should couples\nbe having intercourse.\nAnd here, I'm\nreferring specifically\nto intercourse with ejaculation.\nHow often should couples\nbe having intercourse\naround the time of ovulation\nif the specific goal is\nsuccessful fertilization of the\negg and the creation of a baby?\nThis is leaving aside all\nissues, which, of course, are\ninteresting issues, related\nto how often people are having\nintercourse, whether or\nnot there's ejaculation\nevery time they have intercourse\nor not, for sake of pleasure\nor for sake of pair\nbonding and pleasure\nor for sake of any number\nof other potential goals\nof intercourse.\nHere I'm only referring\nto intercourse\nas it relates to the goal\nof fertilization of the egg.\nSo knowing what we know about\nspermatogenesis and the fact\nthat ejaculate is going to\ncontain a certain concentration\nof sperm but that within that\nejaculate some of the sperm\nwill be older and less healthy\nand some will be optimally\nmature and some might\neven be a little bit\nimmature-- although there's a\ntendency for the immature sperm\nto not have yet exited the\nseminiferous tubules, gone\ninto the epididymis\nand vas deferens.\nBut given that the\nejaculate contains\nsperm of varying ages and\ntherefore varying quality\nand given that with each\nsuccessive ejaculation\nin a short period\nof time there's\ngoing to be a decrease in\nthe concentration of sperm\nper milliliter of\nsemen, of ejaculate,\nwe can make some\ngood arguments as\nto how often couples\nshould have intercourse\nwith ejaculation around\nthe time of ovulation\nif the goal is to fertilize.\nIf ovulation occurs\non, for instance,\nday 14 of a cycle--\nand here we're\nusing the kind of\nstandard average\nof 28 days of the cycle.\nBut for some people\nwith a 30-day cycle,\nit could be day 15, or\nwith a shorter cycle,\nit could be day\n12, for instance.\nBut given a 28-day\naverage cycle,\nlet's say ovulation occurs\non day 13 or on day 14.\nAnd typically, it would occur\non day 14 of a 28-day cycle.\nWell, then, given how long\nsperm can survive inside\nof the woman, you might think\nthat the optimal strategy would\nbe to have as much intercourse\nwith ejaculation in the three\nor four days leading\nup to ovulation, hope\nthat those sperm have swam\nas far as they possibly\ncan and will encounter the\negg just as soon as possible\nafter it ovulates.\nIt turns out that's not\nthe optimal strategy.\nThe optimal strategy is really\nto maximize the concentration\nof healthy sperm\nwithin each ejaculate\nand to really center that\naround the day of ovulation.\nSo what this involves\ngenerally and what\nthe typical recommendation is\nis to abstain from intercourse\nwith ejaculation\nabout two or three\ndays out from ovulation\nand then, on the day\nprior to ovulation and\non the day of ovulation,\nto essentially\nintroduce as much semen\nand ejaculate into the\nreproductive pathway\nof the female as possible.\nNow, that's the\ngeneral recommendation\nthat the OB/GYNs and the\nurologists that I spoke to\ngave.\nBut you will also hear\na different strategy.\nIt's only slightly different.\nBut the different\nstrategy involves\ntrying to maximize the\nconcentration of healthy sperm\nwithin each ejaculate with\nthe understanding that,\nwith each subsequent ejaculation\nover about a 24-hour period,\nthat there's going to\nbe a dramatic reduction\nin the concentration of sperm.\nWhat that means is that\nif a couple, for instance,\nwere to have intercourse\nwith ejaculation many times\non the day prior\nto ovulation, yes,\nthat will introduce\na lot of sperm\ninto the reproductive pathway\nof the female, but what it means\nis that, on the day of\novulation if they were\nto have intercourse, the\nnumber of high quality sperm\nthat will be available to the\negg will be greatly diminished.\nAnd if none of the sperm\nthat were introduced\nin the day prior managed\nto fertilize that egg,\nwell, then essentially\nchances are off\nthat there will be fertilization\nor they're greatly diminished.\nRather, if they're having\nintercourse with ejaculation\nonce or twice on the\nday prior to ovulation\nand then a maximal number\nof times with ejaculation\non the day of\novulation, that itself\ncan maximize the probability\nof fertilization.\nSo which strategy is optimal?\nShould couples have\nas much intercourse\nwith ejaculation on the\nday prior to ovulation\nand on the day of ovulation?\nOr should they have intercourse\non the day prior to ovulation\nbut not so frequently that it\ndiminishes the concentration\nof sperm and then\nallows for intercourse\nwith the maximum\nnumber of ejaculations\non the day of ovulation?\nYou really hear it both ways.\nAnd what this really\nboils down to is,\nfrankly, that nobody knows.\nAnd the reason nobody\nknows is that there's\ntremendous variation\namong males in terms\nof the absolute concentration\nof sperm per milliliter\nof ejaculate and the amount\nof sperm per milliliter\nof ejaculate within\na given time frame.\nBut what everyone agrees on\nis that a period of abstinence\nranging from 48 to 72 hours\nprior to an ejaculation\nincreases the concentration\nof high-quality sperm\nwithin that first ejaculation\nto occur after the abstinence\nperiod.\nSo again, to reiterate, if one's\ngoal is to fertilize the egg,\nyou want to take\ninto consideration\nthat most often\nthere is going to be\na dramatic decline in the\nconcentration of sperm\nper ejaculate any time those\nejaculations are occurring\nwithin a short\nperiod of time, say,\nwithin 12 to 24\nhours of one another.\nNow, all of this,\nof course, also\nrelates to the female\nbiology and the extent\nto which the woman can\nprecisely identify the day\nand timing of her ovulation.\nSome women feel as if and\nindeed are very accurate\nat estimating their\ntime of ovulation\nto within a couple of\nhours or some women even\nreport being able to feel\ntheir actual ovulation,\nwhether or not they are\nfeeling the ovulation\nitself, the deployment of\nthe egg or not, isn't clear.\nI certainly wouldn't know.\nI've never produced eggs,\nnor have I ovulated,\nand I'm certainly not\ngoing to contest the idea\nthat women can do that.\nI mean, it makes\nsense that some people\nhave a very keen\nso-called interoceptive\nawareness, an awareness\nof the sensory events\nwithin their body.\nAnd while, of course,\nthe ovaries are not\nthought of as an\norgan that we want\nto be able to sense what's going\non in there in terms of feel,\nthere are sensory\nendings within the ovary.\nAnd so the notion that one\ncould literally sense changes\nwithin their ovary, including\nthe deployment of the egg,\nis not outside the bounds\nof reason and, in fact,\ncould likely be the case.\nNow, that said, there are\na number of different ways\nthat women will track\ntheir ovulation.\nOne is the temperature method.\nSo they'll actually measure\nintravaginal temperature.\nThey're looking for\nchanges in temperature\nthat are consistent around\nthe time of ovulation.\nWe're going to have an expert\nguest on, an OB/GYN, who\ncan tell us a lot more about\nthe details and nuances\nof the temperature method.\nYou'll see a lot of\ninformation about this online,\nbut there's a lot of\nmisunderstanding about it,\nas well.\nOther women will use apps\nthat take into account\neither the temperature\ninformation\nif they're acquiring\ntemperature information--\nthat'll be entered\ninto the app--\nas well as marking the\nonset of menstruation,\nthe onset of\nbleeding, therefore,\nthe start of the\novulatory cycle,\nbecause, of course, as\nwe mentioned earlier,\nthat marks day one\nof their cycle.\nAnd then, again\nand again, you can\nsee how regularity\nof cycle duration\nor relative regularity\nof cycle duration\nreally favors this whole\nprocess of being able to predict\nwhen one ovulates.\nAnd fortunately, if the\ngoal is fertilization,\nthere are some margins for error\nthat are introduced by the fact\nthat the sperm can survive\nwithin the female reproductive\ntract for some period of\ndays, thereby reducing\nthe need for absolute certainty\nabout the time of ovulation\nand so on.\nIn fact, it's pretty well\nknown that around the time\nof ovulation a couple\nof things happen.\nEarlier, we talked\nabout one thing,\nwhich is there's an increase in\nlibido just prior to ovulation.\nThis relates to, in\npart, an increase\nin some of the androgens,\nthings like DHEA,\nbut also testosterone and\nsome related androgens\nthat can increase libido both\nin males and females and changes\nto the reproductive pathway,\nthe female in particular,\na change in the pH-- that\nis, the relative acidity\nversus basic nature of the\nmucosal lining near the cervix\nand also vaginal\nsecretions, such that,\naround the time of ovulation,\nthe entire milieu of the vagina\nand the cervix and the locations\nin which fertilization can\noccur and certainly in\nwhich the sperm are swimming\ntowards the opportunity\nfor fertilization\nis shifted to support\nsperm motility and health.\nIn other words, one of the\nbest environments for sperm\nto survive is going to be within\nthe female reproductive pathway\nitself.\nAnd as long as we're talking\nabout vaginal secretions\nand mucus, it's\nimportant to point out\nthat a number of commercially\navailable lubricants\ncan actually be detrimental\nfor sperm health,\neven if they don't\ncontain spermicide.\nSo this is something\nthat you'll want\nto discuss with your OB/GYN\nor, certainly if you're male,\nyou could also discuss\nthis with your urologist\nand your partner's OB/GYN.\nA lot of the commercially\navailable lubricants\ncontain chemicals that,\nwhile they may favorably\nchange the consistency\nor the viscosity\nof the vaginal pathway for\npurposes of intercourse,\ncertainly may not be the most\nfavorable for maintaining\nthe health of the sperm and\nthe motility of the sperm.\nSo again, here we're talking\nabout intercourse only\nin the context of trying\nto maximize fertilization.\nAnd I should mention\nthat there are\ncertain lubricants that are\nmore conducive to the sperm\nenvironment.\nBut it's something\nthat you'll really\nwant to talk to\nyour OB/GYN about\nor at least read up\nabout if your interest is\nin trying to fertilize\nand develop an embryo.\nSo we covered the\noptimal strategies\nfor how often couples\nshould have intercourse\nwith ejaculation around\nthe time of ovulation\nin order to maximize\nthe probability\nthat successful fertilization\nand ultimately pregnancy will\noccur.\nWhat we haven't\ncovered yet, however,\nis how long couples should apply\nthat method over time in order\nto achieve successful\nfertilization in pregnancy.\nNow, of course, if\na couple decides\nthat they want to\nconceive and they\napply that method or any\nother method, for instance,\nand they achieve fertilization\nand a successful pregnancy\nthe very first\nmonth that they try,\nwell, then there's\nno other work to do,\nat least until that\nchild is born and if\nand only if they decide they\nwant to have more children.\nHowever, many couples\nfind that they do not\nconceive in the first\nmonth of trying,\neven when they apply\nthe optimal methods\nand even if their age and every\nother factor related to egg\nquality and sperm\nquality is optimized.\nNow, I think it's\nthe rare instance\nin which egg quality and\nsperm quality are optimized.\nIn fact, the word \"optimal\" and\n\"optimization\" and \"optimized\"\nis a little bit\nmisleading in general\nbecause no one really\nknows what that is.\nBut of course,\nthere is an ideal.\nThere's a perfect\nstandard to which\neveryone would like to achieve.\nBut of course, we all enter the\npicture with genetic variables,\nenvironmental variables,\nand so forth, many of which\nwe'll talk about because you\ncan, in fact, adjust them\nin the direction that you would\nlike to improve sperm and egg\nquality.\nBut most people simply\nwill not succeed\nin achieving a successful\nfertilization the first month\nthat they try.\nNow, there is a\ntruth that governs\nhow many tries it\nought to take in order\nto achieve successful\nfertilization and ultimately\npregnancy.\nAnd it's very age dependent.\nAnd in particular, it's\ndependent on the age\nof the mother, because the\nage and quality of the egg,\nwhile it's not the only\nfactor, is certainly\none of the most determining\nfactors in whether or not\nsuccessful fertilization occurs.\nAnd as women age, the\nquality of the eggs\ntends to diminish\nover time, largely\ndue to changes in the\nmitochondrial function\nand the spindle that pulls\nthe chromosomes apart,\nalthough there could be other\nfactors involved as well.\nNow, before continuing\nany further,\nI just want to acknowledge that\nthis whole language around egg\nquality and sperm quality\nis not the greatest\nlanguage because it's\nentirely subjective.\nAnd yet the word \"quality\"\nin these instances\nis really there to\nexplain a broad variety\nof factors that can,\nin fact, be measured,\nthings like the number of\nfollicles that are deployed\neach month in a woman's\novulation or the number\nof motile sperm or the number\nof morphologically-- that\nis, correctly shaped sperm\nin the male and so forth.\nSo when we talk about egg\nquality or sperm quality,\nwe're really referring to an\namalgam of different features\nrelated to the different\naspects of ovulation\nleading to successful\nfertilization\nor the different aspects of\nsperm related to whether or not\nthey can arrive and\ndeliver their DNA contents\nand so forth.\nSo I will use the words \"egg\nquality\" and \"sperm quality\"\njust as general themes\nbecause that's what\na lot of the clinicians use.\nBut I do understand that it's\na little bit of a loaded term\nin both instances, and it\ndoesn't relate to any one\nspecific parameter, per se.\nSo getting back to this\nissue of how long couples\nshould try according to\nthe age of the female\nand perhaps also\nthe age of the male.\nWell, most of the data\nthat have been collected\nrelate to the age of the\nfemale, as I mentioned before.\nAnd what we're\nabout to discuss is,\nwithin the scientific\nliterature,\ndescribed as what's\ncalled fecundability,\nwhich is the amount of time\nover which a given couple needs\nto attempt to\nconceive-- of course,\nby having intercourse\nwith ejaculation--\naround the time of ovulation.\nIt assumes that all\nthe other things\nare being done correctly.\nAnd what we know is that there's\na strong age-dependent effect\nthat largely rests on the\nage of the egg-- that is,\nof the female.\nAnd what we know is that\nfor females 30 years old\nor younger, if they have\nintercourse with ejaculation\naround the time of\novulation, say, on the day\nbefore and on the\nday of ovulation--\nand there could be other\nintercourse with ejaculation\naround that time as well--\non average, that will result\nin a successful fertilization\nin pregnancy about\n20% of the time\non the first month\nof attempting,\nthe first ovulation cycle.\nNow, if fertilization and\npregnancy occurs, great.\nThere'll be at least\na nine-month lag\nuntil they decide\nwhether or not they\nwant to try and conceive again.\nHowever, most couples, even\nif the woman is 30 years\nold or younger, will\nnot successfully\nconceive on that first attempt.\nAnd that's because the\nprobability is not 100%.\nIt's 20%.\nSo 80% of the time,\nthey simply will not\nconceive, which means that\nthey hopefully will try again\nthe very next month.\nAnd if they successfully\nconceive, great.\nAnd if they don't,\nthen they ought\nto try again the next month,\nthe next month, and so forth.\nNow, the typical advice that\nan OB/GYN would give you\nis that, for a woman\n30 years or younger--\nand leaving aside\nthe age of the father\nbut still assuming that egg\nquality and sperm quality\nare sufficiently high to\nachieve fertilization--\nthat the couple should--\nor if the woman is trying\nto have kids alone,\nthe woman should\nattempt to conceive over\nthe period of six months.\nWhy?\nWell, if you think\nabout it, if there's\na 20% chance in the first month\nand it's unsuccessful, well,\nthen on the second month,\nthere'll also be a 20% chance.\nOn the third month,\nalso a 20% chance.\nWhat I'm describing\nhere is what obviously\nis independent probabilities.\nThat is, if you\nwere to flip a coin\nand the probability of\ngetting heads is 50%,\nthe probability of getting\ntails is 50%, of course.\nYou don't expect that the\nprevious flip had anything\nto do with the\nresult that you'll\nget on the subsequent flip.\nThat's what independent\nprobabilities are.\nHowever, when it comes\nto fecundability,\nwe're really talking\nabout something\nwhich is called cumulative\npregnancy rate, which\nis not really independent\nprobabilities.\nNow, why would that be?\nWhy would it be that if\nyou did not successfully\nconceive in the first\nmonth of trying that,\nby simply trying again and\nagain and again, the probability\nof conceiving would increase?\nWell, the reason for that\nis that this whole business\nof fertilization is\nnot just about what's\nhappening with the egg.\nIt's also about what's\nhappening with the sperm.\nSo there are a number of\ndifferent events related\nto the biology of the egg and\nthe biology of the sperm, which\nyou are now very familiar\nwith from everything\nI've talked about up until now.\nAnd there a bunch\nof chance events,\nfor instance, that the\nsperm won't actually\narrive at the egg in time\nor that the egg won't arrive\nat the sperm in time,\nbecause, of course,\nit's a bidirectional\nmigration of those two cell\ntypes, or that, for\nwhatever reason,\nfertilization won't occur.\nSo what we're really\ntalking about when\nwe talk about the cumulative\npregnancy rate over time\nis the fact that there are\nmultiple probabilities at work.\nAnd yes, those are somewhat\nindependent in the sense\nthat the biology of the\nsperm doesn't really strictly\ndepend on the\nbiology of the egg,\nat least not until they\nmeet and fertilize.\nBut the likelihood\nof pregnancy depends\non those independent\nprobabilities,\nwhich makes this a\ncumulative pregnancy rate.\nNow, if any of that is\nconfusing, what it basically\nmeans is that for\nthe egg and the sperm\nto meet and to fertilize, a\nnumber of different events\nthat carry some intentionality--\nthe sperm swims towards\nthe egg and so forth.\nThe egg doesn't have a\npersonality in there,\nat least not yet.\nBut it, quote, unquote,\n\"wants\" to be fertilize.\nIt is, in principle,\nreceptive to fertilization.\nWell, in order for\nthat to happen,\nthere are going to be some\nevents related to chance\nthat could limit the\nability for that to happen,\nand there'll be\nother events dictated\nby the biology of those\ntwo cell types that\nare driving that\nevent to happen,\nthat are biasing the\nevent to, yes, happen.\nAnd so what we're\ntalking about when\nwe talk about cumulative\npregnancy rate\nis how much of the\nbiology of the woman\nis skewed towards fertilization\nto be likely to occur.\nSo to make this very\nsimple, all we need to know\nis that for women 30\nyears old or younger,\nbecause the probability of\ngetting pregnant on any one\nattempt to conceive\nis 20%, well,\nthen if that doesn't\noccur the first time,\nthen she should simply\nrepeat that at least five\nand probably six times before\ndeciding to go to an OB/GYN\nand conclude that there's\nsomething going on either\nwith the egg or, of course,\nit could be with the sperm\nbecause 20 times 5 is 100.\nSo we're talking about\ncumulative percent--\nso 20, 40, 60, 80, 100.\nAnd the six month\nthere would take you\nto 120%, which is a\ndifferent thing altogether.\nBut in general,\nthat's why OB/GYNs\nwill tell their\nfemale patients, look,\nif you're setting\nout to conceive,\ntry for about five\nor six months,\nand if you're not successful,\ncome back and see me.\nNow, for women who\nare age 31 to 33,\nthe probability of conceiving\nin that first month\ndrops to about 18%.\nSo women in that age\nrange and their partners\nshould certainly try\nand conceive naturally\nover a period of six or\nseven months in order\nto get to that 100%\ncumulative probability.\nAnd then for women\nwho are age 34 to 37,\nthe probability of conceiving\nin that first month\nof trying and certainly every\nmonth thereafter is about 11%.\nSo when the age of the\nwoman starts extending out\nto about 34 or 35 years\nold, then the typical advice\nof the OB/GYN is going to be\nto attempt to conceive over\na period of about\nnine months to a year\nbefore deciding to take some\nsort of medical intervention.\nAnd then, of course, as the\nage of the woman increases,\nso too does the quality\nof the eggs go down.\nNow, that's not true\nfor every woman.\nThere are many women who, in\ntheir late 30s and 40s and even\nearly 50s, have successfully\nconceived healthy children,\nalthough the probability of\nthat-- the likelihood of it\ndrops substantially.\nSo for instance, for women\nwho are age 38 to 39,\nthe probability of a\nsuccessful conception\nby natural conception--\nintercourse with ejaculation--\nis going to be about 5%.\nSo it's really dropped\nto a quarter of what\nit was when that woman was 30.\nAgain, these are averages only.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, it means that if\nyou are age 38 or older,\nchances are that you should\nprobably go to your OB/GYN\nright at the outset\nof your desire\nto conceive and ask what you\ncan do to improve egg quality.\nOtherwise, if you were\nto extend the math out,\nwe know that if you're age\n30 or younger, 20% chance\nin any one given month.\nThat means about four\nto six months of trying.\nWell, you can simply multiply\nthat times four or five\nfor someone in their\nlate 30s or early 40s.\nAnd so what you're\nreally talking about\nis several years of trying.\nAnd of course, what's happening\nduring those several years?\nThe woman is getting older.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthe quality of the eggs\nis declining even further.\nSo if you are 35, 36\nyears old, it might not\nbe entirely unreasonable to\ntalk to your OB/GYN right\nat the outset of\ndesiring to conceive,\nbut you could also\njust take the approach\nof trying to conceive naturally\nfor about a year or a year\nand a half before deciding\nto do that, keeping in mind\nthat all the while\nyou can't stop time.\nSo biological time and aging is\ngoing to occur in the backdrop.\nBut hopefully this description\nof cumulative pregnancy rate\nmakes sense.\nAgain, the idea is\nthat while it's true\nthat every single month\nthere's an independent chance\nof the woman getting pregnant\nand that chance is dropping\nfrom abut 20% at age 30 over\ntime to about, really, 1% to 3%\nfor women 40 or\nolder, there's also\nthis notion of cumulative\nprobability, which\ninvolves multiple\nbiological events in both\nthe egg and the sperm that have\nto converge in time and space\nin order for successful\nfertilization to occur.\nAs long as we're\non this topic, I\nthink it's only fair to address\nthe issue of miscarriage.\nAnd miscarriages can arise\nfrom a variety of sources.\nThey can arise from\ngenetic defects.\nThey can arise from issues in\nthe milieu view of the uterus.\nThey can arise from issues with\nthe sperm, for that matter.\nWe really don't want to\nput all the weight and all\nthe responsibility on the egg.\nThis is always an\negg/sperm dynamic.\nAnd when I say\negg/sperm dynamic, now\nhopefully that calls to mind\nthe huge library of information\nthat we've been\ncovering up until now\nabout chromosomal segregation\nand the coming together\nof these different cell types\nand their genetic information.\nAny number of different\nsteps within the process\nof fertilization\nleading up to pregnancy\ncan lead to miscarriage.\nHowever, the probability\nof miscarriage\ngreatly increases as a\nfunction of the age of the egg.\nAnd the basic numbers\non thisare are\nthat for women who are 35\nyears or older, about 25%\nof successful fertilizations\nlead to miscarriages.\nNow, when those miscarriages\noccur during pregnancy\ncan be highly variable.\nSometimes it's within\nthe first trimester.\nSometimes it could be later.\nBut the probability\nis about 25%.\nThat probability increases\ngreatly over time,\nsuch that by the time women\nare in their early 40s--\nso 40 or older--\nthe probability of\nmiscarriage after\na successful fertilization\nis going to be about 50%.\nAnd this could be due\nto a number of factors,\nas I mentioned before.\nBut one common reason\nis that there can\nbe chromosomal abnormalities.\nAnd that could be\nrelated typically\nto the segregation\nof the egg when\nhalf of the\nchromosomes in that egg\nare removed, taking it\nfrom diploid to haploid.\nIf you recall, there's\nthat little polar body,\nwhich is the removal of\nthe chromosomes that's\nejected from the egg that\nwill eventually ovulate.\nAnd sometimes not\nall the chromosomes\nthat were supposed to be ejected\nin that polar body are ejected.\nAnd as a consequence, there\nare multiple chromosomes\nor duplications of chromosomes,\nthings like trisomies.\nSometimes too many\nchromosomes move away\nand there are actually\nremoval of entire chromosomes,\nmeaning both strands, so that\nyou have chromosomal deletions.\nAnd in that case, typically\nfertilization won't occur.\nBut there are instances in\nwhich fertilization will occur.\nSo a woman will get a\npositive pregnancy test.\nHer periods will stop.\nAnd the couple will\nthink that they're\nadvancing along the steps\nto a successful pregnancy,\nand then there will be,\nsadly, a miscarriage.\nMany, many times\nthose miscarriages\nare the consequence\nof the fact that,\nwhen there are extra\nchromosomes there or there\nare too few chromosomes present,\nthat embryogenesis can simply\nnot progress in a healthy way.\nThere are some\ninstances in which\nall of the chromosomes and all\nthe chromosomal arrangements\nare perfectly normal and\nmiscarriages can still occur.\nI'm going to do a future\nepisode about pregnancy\nand embryonic\ndevelopment where we\nwill get into this more deeply.\nBut just understand that the\nfrequency of miscarriages\nincreases dramatically\nafter about age 34\nand then continues to\nincrease dramatically,\nextending well\nout until the 40s.\nNow, a very important\nconsideration\nin terms of understanding\nand predicting\nfertility and fecundability,\nthis word that describes\nthe probability of getting\npregnant on a given try\nand over time, is\ntrying to address how,\nquote, unquote,\n\"fertile\" a woman is\nand, importantly, how, quote,\nunquote, \"fertile\" a male is.\nAnd we'll talk about the\nmale side in a moment.\nBut when trying to address how\nfertile a woman is, of course,\nage is going to be one of the\nmajor factors, but just one\nfactor.\nWe already talked about\nhow age determines\nthe likelihood of a\nsuccessful pregnancy\nif the intercourse and\nejaculation is being carried\nout at the correct times\nand with viable sperm\ncapable of fertilizing eggs.\nAnd then, of course, there's\nthe issue of egg quality.\nBut in general, most\nwomen would like\nto know how fertile they are\nas a function of their age.\nAnd I actually think this is\none of the most important topics\nin this whole space\naround fertility\nthat isn't often discussed or\nat least isn't often discussed\nuntil women are in\ntheir late 30s or 40s,\nwhen oftentimes\nthey will look back\nand wish that either they\nhad frozen their eggs\nor they had frozen fertilized\nembryos, which is a whole thing\nunto itself.\nAnd we can talk\nabout that when we\nhave an episode on in-vitro\nfertilization in more depth.\nBut there is a fairly\nstraightforward way\nor set of ways that\nwomen can determine\ntheir basic level of fertility.\nLeaving aside a lot\nof the detailed issues\nabout the quality of eggs\nand so forth, one thing\nthat you already learned\nis that there's this vault,\nthere's this reserve that\nwe call the ovarian reserve,\nand that each month a\ncertain number of follicles\nleave that reserve, and\nthere's the opportunity, based\non the ovulation of a single\negg, to fertilize that egg\nand for the woman\nto get pregnant.\nNow, one thing that\nwe know for sure\nis that the size of\nthe population that's\nreleased from that\nvault each month\nhas a very strong\npositive correlation\nwith the size of the\nreserve in the vault itself.\nSo the way to think\nabout this, perhaps,\nis that the vault is\nlike a bank account.\nIt has a certain\namount of money--\nin this case, eggs-- in it.\nAnd you could imagine, if\nsomeone's reasonably logical,\nthat if they have more money\nin their bank account, then\nthey're going to\nwithdraw a larger amount\neach month than if they have\na small amount each month,\nif the idea is to make\nthat vault, that bank,\nof eggs available to them over\nthe longest period of time.\nAnd indeed, biology\nis pretty smart.\nIt doesn't deploy or release\nhalf the follicles in one month\nand then just slowly trickle\nout the remainder of follicles.\nNo, that's not how it works.\nWhat you find is that, of\ncourse, in younger women--\nso, say, in their late\nteens, 20s, and 30s--\nthe ovarian reserve\nin the vault is\ngoing to have more eggs\nin it, and the number\nof follicles and eggs that\nleave that vault each month\nis going to be quite high.\nSo one way to evaluate\nhow, quote, unquote,\n\"fertile\" you are--\nagain, just one way--\nis to go to your OB/GYN\nand say that you would like\nto know how many follicles\nyou have in a given month.\nAnd of course, they'll\nlook at them on both sides,\nin both ovaries.\nAnd for instance, if a woman\nhas just two or three follicles\nthat are out each month, well,\nthen the assumption-- again,\nit's just an assumption-- but\nthe assumption that's pretty\ngood-- because there is this\npositive correlation that\ngenerally occurs--\nis that that ovarian reserve--\nthat the number of\neggs in the vault\nis fairly low\ncompared to someone\nwho, say, has 20 follicles\nor 30 follicles each month.\nAnd that's the typical trend.\nAgain, these are averages.\nAnd it's very important to not\nget attached to any one number\nhere.\nAgain, these are averages.\nSo for instance, there are women\nwho only deploy five follicles\nand eggs each month out\nof their ovarian vault\nbut who find themselves\nto be very fertile.\nAnd there could be a\nnumber of different factors\nto explain that.\nOther women will\nhave 20 or 30 eggs\nand follicles that leave that\nvault, the ovarian reserve,\neach month.\nAnd they will have a\nharder time getting\npregnant for any number\nof different reasons.\nBut in general, the\nmore eggs and follicles\nthat leave the vault each\nmonth, the higher number\nof eggs that are still in\nreserve, meaning the greater\namount of time over which\na given woman could still\nattempt to have\nsuccessful fertilizations.\nNow, this small collection\nof follicles and eggs\nthat are released each\nmonth actually has a name.\nThey're called antral follicles.\nThese are small follicles.\nThey tend to be about 2\nto 9 millimeters across.\nThe way these are\nanalyzed or measured\nis woman will go into the OB/GYN\noffice, and by ultrasound--\ntypically there's\nsome local anesthesia,\nbut it's not often a\ngeneral anesthesia,\nbut by local anesthesia or\nsometimes no anesthesia--\nthey will essentially count\nthe number of follicles that\nare present in each side,\non ovary on the left\nand the ovary on the right, and\ngive a woman some sense of how\nmany follicles she has.\nAnd typically this is done\nover a series of months\nto determine how many eggs\nare leaving the ovarian\nreserve each month and\ntherefore how many eggs\nshe is likely to still have\nin the ovarian reserve.\nnow there's a noninvasive\nway to do this, as well.\nAlthough, typically, an OB/GYN\nwill do both what I just\ndescribed with ultrasound and\nmeasure something called AMH,\nwhich is anti-Müllerian hormone,\nwhich is a hormone that is\nreleased by that antral\nfollicle population,\nthe population of follicles\nand eggs that leave the ovarian\nreserve each month.\nSo one is a blood draw\nmeasure of a hormone, AMH.\nThe other is a structural\nimaging measure\nof the antral\nfollicles directly.\nagain the typical trend is for\nthe number of antral follicles\nto decline over time.\nSo one might expect,\nfor instance,\nthat a woman in her 20s or\n30s might have 20, 30, maybe\neven 40 antral\nfollicles that are\nexiting the reserve each month.\nAnd again, that's the\ntotal across both ovaries.\nAgain, these are just averages.\nThese are going to\nbe distributions.\nThere will be people\nwith far fewer.\nThere will be people\nwith far more.\nBut that over time, regardless\nof where a woman starts out,\nfrom one decade to the\nnext half decade and decade\nand so on, that the number of\nantral follicles will decline\nand the amount of or the levels\nof AMH will also decline.\nSo what does this all mean?\nWhat this means\nis that if you are\na woman who is in her 20s or\n30s or 40s, whatever your age,\nif you are interested in\nconceiving in the future,\nit's very likely a good\nidea to go to your OB/GYN\nand get either your AMH levels\nmeasured or your follicle count\nmeasured and to do that several\ntimes in a given period.\nAnd I don't mean a\nmenstrual period.\nI mean given a period of\ntime across several months\nto determine what is the average\nnumber of follicles, what's\nyour average AMH level,\nthereby giving you\nsome window into how many\neggs you are likely to still\nhave in your ovarian reserve.\nI cannot tell you how many women\nthat I've spoken to and how\nmany OB/GYNs--\nmore importantly,\nbecause they speak\nto many more women about this\nthan I ever have or ever will--\nwish that they had\ndone this earlier.\nThey think, oh,\nwell, I'm in my 20s,\nso I'm likely to have\na ton of follicles,\nor they got pregnant\nonce before,\nand so they're not so concerned\nabout the number of follicles\nor their AMH levels.\nBut over and over\nagain, I was told\nin researching for this\nepisode that the earlier\nand more frequent that women\ndo this procedure of measuring\nAMH and measuring\ntheir follicle count,\nthe higher the probability\nthat they will eventually\nhave a successful\nfertilization and pregnancy\nwhen they seek to do so.\nNow, the mirror image of all\nthis, of course, is the sperm.\nAnd there's a kind of\ncommon misconception\nout there that, you know,\nthe sperm, you only need one.\nAnd indeed you only need one.\nBut actually, you\nneed many, and it's\nonly one that's able to\nsuccessfully fertilize the egg.\nSo this whole\nconcept of you only\nneed one is both\ndismissive of the sperm\nbut more importantly\ndismissive of the biology\nof the sperm and the egg.\nIt only takes one successful\nsperm and one successful egg,\nbut that's sort of\nlike telling a woman,\nhey, you only need one egg.\nYou need one egg of sufficient\nquality in the right time\nand place, and\nyou need one sperm\nof sufficient quality in\nthe right time and place\nin order to get successful\nfertilization and hopefully\npregnancy.\nBut you need a lot\nof sperm in order\nto get a high probability\nthat that one sperm will\nbe able to successfully\nfertilize the egg.\nSo we have this image of\nsperm as these dumb operators\nthat just sort of swim\nmindlessly towards anything.\nAnd if they bump into an egg,\nthen they fertilize the egg.\nAnd that's really\nnot the way it works.\nAs I talked about\nearlier, the sperm--\nwith its head, its\nmid region, its tail,\nchock a block with mitochondria\nin the mid region--\nis really an active motile\ncell that indeed will just\nswim forward, if it's a healthy,\nforward progressing sperm.\nBut many males out\nthere just simply\ndo not have any knowledge\nof how many quality\nsperm that they happen to have.\nNow, given the fact\nthat sperm analysis\nis relatively inexpensive and\nalso the fact that freezing\nsperm is relatively\ninexpensive, I\nthink it stands to reason that\nmost men should at least get\nsome window into the number\nand quality of their sperm.\nNow, it's a fair assumption\nto say that if someone\nis in their late teens\nor early 20s or 30s\nthat they probably have\nhigh-quality sperm.\nBut again, as with the\negg and the importance\nof measuring AMH and\nfollicle count across time,\nmen should really evaluate\nthe quality and number\nof their sperm.\nAnd we talked a\nlittle bit earlier\nabout some of the parameters\nthat urologists and OB/GYNs\nlike to see when\nevaluating sperm.\nThere's a minimum number\nor concentration of sperm\nthat they'd like to see if\na couple is going to use\nIVF, in-vitro fertilization.\nAnd typically that's going\nto be about 15 to 20 million\nper mil of sperm or semen.\nAnd typically they want to\nsee somewhere between 2 and 5\nmilliliters of semen,\noverall, in a given\nejaculate after a 72 to 48 hour\nabstinence period, because,\nof course, the\nmore ejaculations,\nthe smaller the volume\nof the ejaculate\nin a short period of time.\nBut after 48 to 72\nhours, you more or less\nmaximize the volume\nof ejaculate.\nAnd then, of course, they\nwant to see 50% but typically\n60% or more of motile\nsperm in order to get IVF,\nbut more is better.\nAnd of course, there\nis an enormous range,\nas I mentioned before.\nSome males will have anywhere\nfrom 10 to 20 million sperm\nper milliliter of\nejaculate, and some men\nwill have 100 to 200 million.\nBut just because they\nhave 100 to 200 million\ndoesn't mean that all of those\nsperm are of high quality\nand can fertilize eggs.\nSometimes more than\nhalf will be twitchers,\nand some will be immotile,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo it's very\nstraightforward what\nI believe most people\nshould do and what\nthe urologists I spoke to\nin advance of this episode\nsaid to do, which is to\nsimply do a sperm analysis.\nRefrain from ejaculation\nfor 48 to 72 hours.\nGive a sperm sample.\nHave that sperm sample analyzed.\nThe cost of the sperm analysis\nis not typically that much.\nAnd considering that conception\nand healthy conception\nand fertilization is\nan expensive process\nif you have to go the\nin-vitro fertilization route,\nit stands to reason that the\ncost is pretty well justified.\nYou also have the option\nto freeze sperm over time.\nThere is evidence that\nthe age of the father\nand therefore the\nage of the sperm\ncan dictate whether\nor not there's\na higher incidence of\nproblematic pregnancy\nor developmental outcomes,\nincluding autism.\nThat is true.\nYou've probably heard\nthat if the father is\n40 years or older, the\nincidence of autism\nis increased significantly.\nThat is true.\nAlthough the overall probability\nof having an autistic offspring\nif somebody-- if the father,\nthat is-- is 40 years or older\nis still quite a bit lower\nthan you would imagine.\nIt's not as if the probability\nsuddenly skyrockets.\nSo we'll have an\nepisode on autism\nand genetic and\nnon-genetic influences\non autism and other aspects\nof the autism spectrum.\nBut the point is this.\nI believe and the\nurologists I spoke\nto who are interested in\nfertility and male health\nand sexual health\nsuggest that men\nget their sperm analyzed\nat least once every five\nyears and certainly,\nif they're going\nto want to conceive children\nin the distant future,\nthat they consider freezing\ntheir sperm because that, too,\nis fairly nominal cost in order\nto freeze sperm at a younger\nage.\nAnd of course, if you\ncan freeze and use sperm\nfrom the time in which you\nwere younger, why wouldn't you,\nright?\nI mean, you can still opt\nto go for natural pregnancy\nlater if that's\nwhat you want to do.\nBut having that in reserve\nis generally a good idea.\nAnd I discussed some of the\nparameters that are looked for.\nAnd perhaps most\nimportantly, there\nis the possibility of an\nunderlying issue whereby,\nfor instance, there is very\nlittle sperm in an ejaculate.\nAs I mentioned earlier, the\nseminal fluid in the ejaculate\ncould have zero sperm in it,\nbut the volume of ejaculate\ncould appear completely normal.\nSo just because your ejaculate\nvolume is normal to you\nor is in that range\nof 2 to 5 milliliters,\nwell, then that\ndoesn't necessarily\nmean that there\nare any sperm there\nor that there are very few sperm\nthere and the few sperm that\nare there or the many sperm that\nthere are functionally motile.\nSo get this analyzed.\nIt's really worth doing.\nAnd again, it's not something\nyou have to do every year.\nIt's something that you want to\ndo probably every five years,\nat least until the\npoint where you've\nconceived as many children\nas you ever want to conceive.\nSo the basic takeaway here\nis that, if you're a woman,\nto get your egg count--\nyour antral follicle count,\nthat is--\nand therefore your reserve\nof eggs, indirectly measured,\nand of course also get\nyour AMH levels measured,\nand if you're a male to\nhave a sperm analysis\nand to do that relatively early.\nIn fact, another\nincentive for doing\nthat early is that\nyou have a comparison\npoint so that, for instance,\nif you are in your early 20s\nand you're not thinking\nabout having kids at all\nor you're thinking that\nyou might someday have kids\nbut it's a really someday,\nsomeday, far off in the future,\nwell, it's wonderful to have\na reference point from which\nto compare your biology\nin your early 20s\nto your biology in your\nmid or late 30s or 40s when\nyou might happen to be\ninterested in conceiving.\nAnd if that doesn't\nprovide incentive enough,\nI should mention-- and this\nis important to point out\nand that I think both\nmales and females are not\naware of-- is that one in\nfive couples that have issues\nwith fertility,\nthe issue ends up\nfalling on the biology that\nis the quality of the sperm\nor a lack of number of sperm.\nSo I think there's a\nmisconception that when\nfertility is an issue it's\nalways an issue with the eggs\nand this age-dependent decline\nin the egg quality-- again,\nit's the best language we have\navailable to us at the moment--\nthis age-dependent decline in\negg quality is often to blame,\nbut not always.\nOne in five couples that\nhave challenges conceiving it\nturns out that it's going to\nbe an issue with the sperm.\nAnd of course, there are a\nnumber of different sperm\nanalyses that, should all\nthe other parameters of sperm\nappear normal,\nnow, for instance,\nyou can get a DNA\nfragmentation analysis.\nYou can see whether or\nnot the DNA of the sperm\nare somehow disrupted.\nUrologists these days are\nexcellent at figuring out,\nfor instance, if a male\nhas lots and lots of sperm,\neverything looks great, but the\nshape of the head of the sperm\nisn't quite right-- if\nit's not oval enough\nand it's too rounded, that could\nbe a genetic defect under which\nconditions there is zero\nprobability of the male ever\nnaturally conceiving, regardless\nof who the female partner is.\nBelieve it or not, males\ncan have a ton of sperm,\nbut if they carry a\ncertain genetic defect,\nthose sperm will be incapable\nof depositing those 23\nchromosomes into the egg.\nHowever, there are ways\nin which that sperm can\nbe coaxed or forced\nto fertilize the egg\nand deposit its genetic contents\nby in-vitro fertilization\nand then implantation\ninto the female.\nSo again, lots of\nreasons to have a egg\nreserve analysis by\nultrasound and AMH\nfor females and lots\nof reasons for males\nto have a sperm analysis.\nAnd of course, typically\nwith a sperm analysis\nand a ovarian reserve analysis\nwill be a hormone analysis.\nAnd I'm a very strong believer\nin people getting an insight--\nthat is, a window--\ninto their hormonal\ncomposition, not just\nwhen they encounter\nproblems but starting\nat a pretty early age, even if\nit's only done once every five\nyears or so, having a\nreference point to your 20s\nand to your 30s and mid-30s for\nwhen you felt a certain way.\nMaybe, as in the case\nfor many people I know,\nthey actually feel\nbetter in their 40s\nthan they did in their\n20s because they're\ndoing a lot of things\nto support their health.\nThat is possible.\nBut in many cases,\npeople start feeling\nnot as well or their fertility\nseems to be dropping off\nor any number of different\nparameters that we've discussed\ntoday were related to\nvitality and longevity seem\nto be dropping off\nover time, and they\nwant to get a insight into\nwhat could be the issue.\nAnd hormones are\nsometimes, not always,\nbut sometimes involved in\nthose underlying issues.\nAnd there is nothing as valuable\nas having a reference point\nfrom a time in which\nthings were going well\nto evaluate the, for\ninstance, levels of hormones,\nnot just testosterone but\nalso estrogen and progesterone\nand so forth.\nSo you need a comparison\npoint in order\nto determine what really\nneeds to be changed.\nSo all of this is a strong\npush for people to use\nyour insurance, if you're\nable to put it on insurance--\noftentimes people are--\nand if not, to try and find a\nreasonable or reasonably priced\nway to do a sperm\nand egg analysis\nand to ideally do a\nhormone analysis as well.\nIt's really going to set you\nup for the maximum probability\nof being able to conceive\nchildren when you want to\nand also to avoid a bunch of\nother health-related issues\nthat involve hormones\nand reproductive health\nand, in general, to support\nyour mental health and physical\nhealth.\nSo I've been talking about\na bunch of things to do.\nThere are a couple of things to\nbe mindful of to actively avoid\nif your goal is to be\nand remain fertile.\nAnd that's regardless\nof whether or not\nyou want to conceive children\nin the future or not.\nNow, in the context\nof this discussion,\nthe same things that\nwe've heard to be\ntrue for other\naspects of our health\nturn out to also be true.\nSo let's just start\nwith the basics.\nEverybody should be getting\napproximately six to eight\nhours of sleep every night.\nThat should be quality sleep.\nOptimizing your sleep is\nfundamental to balancing\nyour hormones.\nNow, balancing your\nhormones is kind\nof a catch phrase for all\nthings related to proper hormone\nregulation.\nSleep is the fundamental\nlayer of mental health,\nphysical health, and\nperformance of all kinds\nand, believe it\nor not, fertility.\nWhen people are not\nsleeping well or enough,\nstress hormones, in\nparticular cortisol,\nshift to peaking\nlater in the day,\nand those elevated cortisol\nlevels later in the day\ncause a bunch of\ndifferent problems\nin both males and females,\nmany of which impact fertility.\nSo controlling cortisol starts\nwith controlling your sleep.\nIt also impacts testosterone\nand estrogen levels.\nSo of course, the proper ratios\nof testosterone and estrogen\nwill vary from males to females.\nBut in order to get\nthose right or as right\nas they can be without\nother interventions,\nyou want to make sure you're\ngetting enough quality sleep.\nHow much sleep?\nMost people need about six to\neight hours of sleep per night.\nWaking up once,\nmaybe twice per night\nin the middle of the night\nand going back to sleep\nis not such a big deal, but six\nto eight hours of solid sleep\nwould be ideal.\nSome people need a\nlittle bit less in order\nto function-- five hours.\nSome people need\na little bit more.\nDeveloping teenagers and babies\nand kids need a lot more.\nPeople who are sick or\nrecovering from injury\nneed a lot more.\nWe've done multiple\nepisodes on sleep.\nWe have a toolkit for\nsleep available free\nat hubermanlab.com.\nYou go there.\nYou don't even have to\nsign up for the newsletter,\nalthough you can if you want.\nJust go to a Toolkit for\nSleep under the menu,\nand you'll be able\nto download that,\nor you can even just\nview it on the screen\nif you don't want\nto download it.\nIt has lots of tools.\nWe've done an episode\ncalled \"Perfect Your Sleep\"\nthat has a lot of tools.\nThey're all timestamped for you.\nWe've done a \"Master Your\nSleep\" episode, so lots of tools\nto get your sleep right.\nGet your sleep right\nif you are wishing\nto conceive and/or to\nsimply have healthy biology,\nto be fertile, or otherwise.\nThat's just fundamental.\nNow, there are other\nthings to not do.\nAnd those, again, fall into the\nsomewhat obvious categories,\nbut I think a lot\nof people aren't\naware of just how striking an\neffect these certain behaviors\nthat you want to avoid can have\nin diminishing your fertility\nfor both males and females.\nSo let's talk about those.\nThe first one is smoking.\nAnd when we talk\nabout smoking here,\nwe're talking about\nsmoking nicotine\nand we're talking\nabout smoking cannabis.\nAnd indeed, there\nare strong data--\nand I will put a\nreference to one\nof the better larger\nanalyses of these data.\nThere are strong data\nshowing that cannabis\nreduces fertility.\nNow, I can already hear\nthe screams from the back,\nalthough they're probably\nfairly drawled out screams,\nfrom the back of people\nsaying they smoke cannabis\nand they had no\ntrouble conceiving.\nCertainly, there\nwill be exceptions.\nBut whether or not\nyou're male or female,\nsmoking cannabis is a\nbad idea if you want\nto conceive a healthy child.\nCan you still conceive a healthy\nchild while smoking cannabis?\nProbably certain people can.\nMany people will greatly\ndecrease the probability\nof a healthy fertilization and\npregnancy by smoking cannabis.\nThere are excellent\ndata to support that.\nAs well, nicotine,\nboth smoked or vaped,\nis going to disrupt the\nprocess of fertilization\nand can disrupt\npregnancy dramatically.\nSo just avoid it altogether.\nHow does this happen?\nWell, it turns out that smoking\nincreases what are called\nreactive oxygen species.\nThis greatly\ndisrupts the quality\nof the egg at the level of\nthe spindle and mitochondria\nand a number of other features.\nAnd in the sperm, turns out\nthat smoking doesn't necessarily\ndisrupt the sperm\ndirectly, although it\ncan cause DNA\nfragmentation, which\ncan cause all sorts\nof abnormalities,\ncan prevent fertilization,\ncan lead to birth defects\nin the offspring.\nBut more importantly,\nit increases\nwhat are called reactive oxygen\nspecies in the seminal fluid,\nin the semen that\ncontain the sperm,\nthis very, under\nnormal circumstances,\nunder healthy\ncircumstances, beautifully\norchestrated chemistry of\nfluid that allows the sperm\nto thrive in their\ntrajectory and attempt\nto fertilize the egg and\nlead to a healthy pregnancy.\nSo if you are a smoker\nand you want to conceive,\nthe best advice I can give\nyou is to quit smoking.\nAnd yes, that includes\ncannabis as well.\nNow, I am not somebody\nwho believes that cannabis\nacross the board is not useful.\nThere are medical applications\nand other applications.\nI talk about that in an\nepisode all about cannabis\nfor health and disease.\nAnd notice, health\nwas in there too.\nSo you cannabis smokers,\ndon't come after me with--\nI guess, whatever it\nis-- with bongs and pipes\nor whatever it is that\nyou want-- or with vapes.\nThe point is that,\nwhile it can be\nbeneficial for\ncertain populations,\nit's certainly bad for others.\nAnd if you're\ntrying to conceive,\nit is bad for fertility and\nfor a healthy pregnancy.\nNow, that's smoking--\nand vaping, by the way.\nVaping is included there.\nNow, the next category of\ndon'ts relates to alcohol.\nNow, everyone has heard that\ndrinking during pregnancy\nis a bad idea.\nYou may have heard\nand some people\nhave talked about\nthe fact that there\nare cultures in\nwhich they allow,\nif you will, or\neven condone, sadly,\none or two drinks\nwhile pregnant,\nprovided it's just champagne\nor something of that sort.\nThat is a terrible idea.\nI did an episode\nall about alcohol,\nboth its potential\nhealth effects,\nof which there turned\nout to be zero.\nAnd yes, that includes red wine.\nIt is far better to\nnot drink at all.\nAnd if you're going\nto drink, the limit--\nif you're a healthy\nadult who's not\ntrying to conceive,\nnot pregnant,\nand you don't have\nissues with alcoholism--\nis probably two\ndrinks per week total.\nThat's right, two\ndrinks per week total.\nAnd that's the level\nthat you really\nshould consider if you're a\ndrinker if you're somebody\nwho's trying to conceive.\nHowever, for a woman\nwho becomes pregnant,\nthe total number of drinks\nthat you should allow yourself\nper week while pregnant and\nbreastfeeding is indeed zero.\nThere is absolutely no evidence\nthat one can, quote, unquote,\n\"get away\" with drinking\nduring pregnancy.\nAnd people say, well, I had\na perfectly healthy child.\nBut, of course, you don't know\nwhat the health of that child\nwould have been had\nyou not drank at all.\nNow, I'm not here with any\ngenerally strong stance\nagainst alcohol.\nI myself am somebody who\nhas a drink every once\nin a while, although I\ndon't consider myself\nsomebody who has a strong\nproclivity for alcohol.\nAnd of course, at\nthis moment, I'm\nnot trying to conceive children\nand I'm certainly not pregnant.\nSo that's safe for me.\nBut frankly, I haven't had\na drink in a very long time.\nAnd so I don't miss it.\nAnd that's me.\nBut I do realize that a lot\nof people enjoy alcohol,\nand so it's that\ntwo drinks per week\nlimit that really\nsets the upper limit\nand threshold beyond which\nyou start running into issues\nwith cellular mutation.\nYou start running into issues\nof oxidative stress, greatly\nincrease cancer risk, in\nparticular breast cancer risk.\nAll of that's covered in the\nalcohol episode that we did.\nYou can find it\nat hubermanlab.com\nand timestamped if you want\nto navigate to specific topics\nand so forth, find out all\nabout the data supporting\nthe statements that I'm\nmaking, so on and so forth.\nNow, if you're somebody who's\nseeking to conceive or you fall\ninto this category that some\ncouples describe themselves\nas we're not trying but\nwe're not not trying--\nmeaning they're not\nusing birth control,\nthey're kind of letting\nchance run its course--\nwell, then you\nshould definitely be\naware of the data\nshowing that even just\none bout, one bout of\nso-called binge drinking,\nwhich is five to six drinks\nin a given night or half day,\nin a 12-hour period-- one\nbout of five to six drinks,\nif you're a woman\nor you're a man,\ngreatly increases both the\nlikelihood of mutations\nin the embryo that would\nresult from a fertilization\nand at the same time, for\nreasons that should be\nobvious to you based on all\nthe biology we've talked about,\na greatly reduced\nprobability of fertilization.\nNow, that absolutely\ndoes not mean\nthat you should use the\ningestion of five or six drinks\nas a method of birth control.\nThat is not what\nI'm saying here.\nWhat I'm saying is that, if\nyou go out on a given night\nand you have five or six\ndrinks and you happen\nto become pregnant,\nthe probability\nthat that pregnancy will\nbe disrupted in some way\nis greatly increased.\nWhat the exact consequences\nare, no one can tell you.\nBut also, if you're somebody\nwho is interested in conceiving\na child, well,\nthen you absolutely\nshould abstain from ingesting\ndrinks more than one or two\nduring the time in which\nyou're trying to conceive,\nand ideally it would be zero.\nAnd you certainly would\nwant to avoid drinking\nmultiple drinks per night.\nAnd so this idea of going out\nand having three or four drinks\nor four or five\ndrinks in a given\nnight at a time in\nwhich you're also\ntrying to conceive children,\nthe biology tells us,\nthe epidemiology tells us that\nthis is just a terrible idea.\nIt's going to reduce the\nlikelihood of fertility\nand successful pregnancy.\nAnd if there is a\nsuccessful pregnancy,\nthe word \"success\" needs\nto be in quotes, right?\nI mean, I think every parent--\nevery species, for\nthat matter-- wants\nto increase the probability\nof having healthy offspring.\nAnd so, to my mind anyway and to\nthe OB/GYNs and the urologists\nthat are focused on\nfertility that I spoke to,\neveryone will say,\ntry as hard as you\ncan to avoid these so-called\nbinge drinking episodes.\nAnd again, these\nepisodes are one night\nof consuming five to six drinks.\nNow, another important thing\nto remember in this context\nis that the negative effects\nof consuming five or six drinks\nin a given night extend\nover many weeks following\nthe ingestion of that alcohol.\nIf you're a male,\nwhat that means\nis that's going to impact\nthe quality of your sperm\nand greatly decrease\nthe likelihood\nof successful fertilization\nand/or healthy pregnancy\nover the period of that entire\nspermatogenesis window, which\nis, as we talked about before,\n60 to 90 days, 60 to generate\nthe sperm and then some\nadditional time for the sperm\nto be transported to the point\nwhere they could be ejaculated.\nIf you're a woman and you have\nfive or six drinks on a given\nnight, well, then you are going\nto disrupt the quality not\nof just the egg that\neventually ovulates\nbut indeed the entire\npool of follicles that\nleaves the ovarian\nvault in reserve\nand from which the one\negg will be selected.\nIn other words, you are reducing\nthe quality of all of the eggs\nthat you happen to\ndeploy that month.\nNow, some of you who were really\nfollowing the biology earlier\nmight say, well, what if\nI have those five or six\ndrinks during the time in which\nI'm menstruating, just in which\nthere's bleeding present?\nAnd therefore, I\nhaven't yet ovulated.\nAh!\nBut if you remember the\nbiology we talked about earlier\nspecifically, there is a\nsubset of follicles and eggs\nthat leave that ovarian reserve\nquite a bit before that one egg\nis selected for and ovulates.\nAnd of course, there are all\nthe different hormonal cascades\nand the general milieu\nof the ovary which\nare important and\nare being regulated\nby different hormones.\nAnd yes, indeed, the\nregulation of those hormones\nis strongly impacted by\nalcohol through a number\nof different pathways,\nthrough the regulation\nof the neurotransmitter\nGABA up in the brain--\nit's actually a lot of\nGABA and GABA receptors\nin the hypothalamus, the\nvery region from which\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone,\nour old friend from a couple\nhours ago in this\ndiscussion, going\nto disrupt GnRH secretion.\nYou can disrupt pituitary\nfunction with alcohol.\nAgain and again,\nwhat we're seeing\nis that consuming more than\none or two drinks per week\nof alcohol is really detrimental\nto the entire process\nof fertility and the entire\nprocess of healthy pregnancy.\nAnd that's true from both\nthe male side and the sperm,\nand it's true from the\nfemale side and the egg.\nSo my simple advice\non this is if you\nare wishing to have a healthy\nfertilization and pregnancy,\nthe best thing to do would\nbe avoid alcohol altogether\nand, if you are going to\ndrink, to really limit\nthat drinking to one or two\ndrinks per week maximum.\nSo those are the major don'ts.\nReally avoid excessive stress.\nAnd I should mention,\nexcessive stress\nis not just best avoided by\ngetting enough quality sleep\nat night.\nAlthough that is\nthe primary way.\nThere are other ways\nto avoid stress.\nWe've done entire\nepisodes about this,\nand we have a toolkit\nrelated to reducing stress\nwith very simple,\nzero-cost tools.\nAgain, you can find all\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nAnd I should\nmention, if you want\nto find any episode\nor topic or timestamp,\nthat website is keyword\nsearch available.\nSo you can just go\nto hubermanlab.com,\nput into the search\nfunction \"stress tools,\"\nand a bunch of different\nlinks will pop up\nrelated to those topics,\nlikewise with sleep, likewise\nwith any number of\ndifferent topics you\nmight be interested in.\nSo get enough quality sleep\nand thereby reduce stress\nand also directly buffer\nstress with real-time tools\nto buffer stress that I've\ntalked about in the episodes\nthat you can access.\nAnd there are ways to greatly\nreduce your overall level\nof stress, to limit\nany cortisol that's\nreleased to early in the day,\nwhich is when you want cortisol\nreleased, and not have\nit late in the day\nand so on and so forth.\nSo reduce your stress.\nAnd as I just told\nyou, by all means,\ndo not drink more than\ntwo drinks per week.\nAnd zero is better than two.\nIf anyone tells you,\noh, well, there's\nall this resveratrol in red\nwine, and that's good for us,\nthe data simply\ntell us there's not\nenough resveratrol in\nred wine to really have\nany positive health benefit.\nThe data around\nresveratrol and health\nbenefits itself is\nunder question nowadays.\nZero alcohol is better\nthan any alcohol.\nTwo drinks per\nweek is the limit.\nAlso, limit or eliminate or\navoid nicotine and ideally\ncannabis, smoking and vaping,\nat the time in which you\nare trying to get pregnant.\nAnd certainly, if\nyou are pregnant,\navoid all of the things, as\nbest you can, that I just\ndescribed a moment ago.\nNow, there are a couple of\nother don'ts that are really\nimportant.\nOne of the most important\ndon'ts relates to STIs,\nor sexually-transmitted\ninfections.\nEveryone who is sexually\nactive should get an STI check.\nIn fact, if you go\nto a fertility clinic\nor you go for sperm analysis\nor you go for egg analysis,\nalmost always they\nwill do an STI check,\neven if you happen to be in\na monogamous relationship,\neven if you happen to\nbe not sexually active\nand you're somebody\nwho is seeking\nto use IVF with a sperm donor\nor something of that sort.\nWhy would they do that?\nWhy is there so much\nconcern about that?\nIs it about avoiding\ngiving birth\nto a child that has something\nlike a herpes infection or HIV?\nWell, certainly\nthat's one reason,\nbut that's a down-the-line\nreason, because\nat the time when someone\ngoes into the clinic for one\nof these sperm or egg analyses,\nthat's well in advance\nof any pregnancy, right?\nThe reason is there\nare a number of STIs--\nin particular chlamydia-- for\nwhich it greatly increases\nthe probability of miscarriage.\nSo chlamydia is one of those\nvery insidious and cryptic STIs\nbecause a lot of people,\nboth males and females,\ndon't even realize that\nthey have chlamydia,\nand then they can\ncarry chlamydia\nat the time in\nwhich they conceive,\nand then that can lead\nto ectopic pregnancies\nand/or miscarriages.\nSo by all means,\nget an STI check\nif you are somebody who's\nseeking to conceive children\nor evaluating your\nfertility generally.\nChlamydia can also have damaging\neffects on the epididymis\nand on the various other aspects\nof male reproductive health.\nIn the future, we\nwill do an episode\nall about sexual health.\nThis is not the time for that.\nBut get an STI\ncheck if your goal\nis to conceive a healthy child.\nNow, the other thing that can\nhave a very negative impact\non fertility and healthy\npregnancy is a viral infection.\nFor instance, if a male has\nhad a severe viral illness--\nand this could be any number\nof different viral illnesses,\nfrom flu to cold or any\nnumber of different viruses.\nPick your favorite virus--\nin the previous 70\nto 90 days, that\ncan greatly diminish the\nnumber and/or quality of sperm.\nSo that's really important.\nThis is also important if you're\ngoing to go in and do a sperm\nanalysis and you had\na viral infection\nin the previous 70 to 90 days.\nWell, then you need\nto be aware of that\nbecause it could greatly impact\nthe parameters of that sperm\nanalysis.\nLikewise, for women, if you've\nhad a serious viral infection\nin the previous 30 days,\ndoes that mean you should not\ntry and conceive?\nNot necessarily, but you should\ntalk to your OB/GYN about that.\nThere are data showing\nthat viral infection--\nin particular of influenza--\nin the mother in the first\ntrimester of pregnancy has some\ncorrelation-- it's not 100%--\nbut some correlation with\nnegative mental health outcomes\nof the offspring sometime\nlater, including schizophrenia.\nThis is some of\nthe work that was\ndone at Caltech a\nnumber of years ago\nand other laboratories, as well.\nThose data are still\nbeing built up over time.\nAgain, it's not one-for-one.\nIt's not causal.\nSo if you did get an influenza\nor a cold or other kind\nof viral infection during\nthe first trimester\nor any trimester of pregnancy,\nI don't want to cause alarm,\nbut you should talk to\nyour OB/GYN about this.\nThe goal, of course, is to\navoid viral illness at any time\nwhen you're trying to conceive\nor have a healthy pregnancy.\nBut of course, sometimes\npeople will get ill,\nand the children can turn out\nto be perfectly normal and fine.\nBut it is something\nthat you want to avoid.\nAnd it will impact\nyour egg analysis,\nand it will impact\nsperm analysis.\nAnd one thing I found\nreally surprising\nin researching this episode\nwas that 1 in 25 men\ncarry a copy of a mutation\nfor cystic fibrosis.\nNow, some of you are probably\nfamiliar with cystic fibrosis\nas a condition that\ncan cause issues\nwith the lungs, the\naccumulation of fluid\nin the lungs or other tissues.\nCystic fibrosis,\nin order to express\nthat way of accumulation\nof fluid in the lungs,\nyou really need two copies.\nYou need two mutant copies\nor you need two copies\nof the cystic fibrosis gene.\n1 in 25 men will\ncarry just one copy\nand therefore will not have any\nsymptoms of cystic fibrosis.\nBut those 1 in 25\nmen will have defects\nin the architecture of\nthe vas deferens, the duct\nthrough which the\nejaculate needs\nto pass in order to\neventually be ejaculated out\nof the urethra.\nAnd so what that means\nis that these men can\nhave what appears to\nbe normal semen volume\nbut that they won't have\nnormal numbers of sperm.\nAnd that's not because of a\ndeficit in making the sperm.\nThe testes can\nfunction just fine.\nThe brain and the\npituitary are communicating\nwith the testes just fine.\nBut that literally\nthe passageway\nby which those sperm arrive\nwithin the seminal fluid\nand are eventually\nejaculated is disrupted\nby the cystic fibrosis gene.\nLuckily, if somebody has just\none copy of the cystic fibrosis\ngene and they're male\nand this is the issue,\nthe vas deferens either can be\nrepaired by a urologist who's\nexpert in the surgical\nrepair of vas deferens\nor sperm can be extracted from\nthe testicle directly, which\nmight sound like a\npainful procedure,\nbut I believe\nnowadays, in talking\nwith various experts\non this, it turns out\nthat it can be done with\na minimum of discomfort.\nAnd certainly, if the goal\nis to have a healthy child,\nyou're going to\nneed those sperm,\nso you're going to want to\nget them one way or the other,\nregardless of the discomfort.\nNow, before getting\ninto some of the things\nthat you can do in\nthe positive sense\nto increase your\nfertility, we do\nneed to touch on just\na few other things\nthat you want to avoid\nin order to avoid\ndiminishing your fertility.\nAnd this mainly\nrelates to males,\nbut it will also be\nrelevant to females.\nAnd of course, when I say\nalso relevant to females,\nI'm referring to the fact that,\nif it's a woman and a man who\nare trying to conceive,\nthen she, of course,\nis going to be interested in her\negg quality but also the sperm\nquality.\nAnd of course,\nthere are women who\nare conceiving by way of sperm\ndonor, through IVF or IUI\nor otherwise.\nBut in any case, the need\nto understand and maximize\nthe quality of both the egg\nand the sperm is paramount.\nSo in order for men to maximize\nthe quality of their sperm,\nas I mentioned\nearlier, does not seem\nto be a big difference\nwhether or not they use boxers\nor briefs or whether or not\nthey, quote, unquote, \"go\ncommando,\" they don't wear any\nboxers or briefs of any kind.\nHowever, it is important to\nkeep the testicles cool enough.\nThey need to be about\n2 degrees cooler\nthan the rest of the body.\nAnd there are a number of\ndifferent ways to do that.\nAs I mentioned before,\navoid going in hot tubs\nduring the period\nin which you're\ntrying to conceive children.\nYou should also\navoid going in saunas\nduring the period\nin which you are\ntrying to conceive children.\nAnd if you do go in the sauna,\nyou can bring an ice pack there\nand you can put it\non the testicles\nin order to offset\nthe heat of the sauna\nand keep the testicles\ncool while in the sauna.\nThe other thing that you'll\ndefinitely want to do\nis avoid putting a laptop\nor any other hot device\ndirectly onto your lap.\nThere are a number\nof different devices\nthat you can put on your lap.\nYou could put books\nor a box or there\nare these devices that\nare designed to dispel\nthe heat from the laptop.\nI would say, if you're\ntrying to conceive,\njust keep the laptop\noff of your lap.\nJust put it on a table or\nstanding desk or whatever.\nJust keep it off of your lap.\nAlso, there are some\nreally interesting data\nshowing that the amount of\ntime that men spend sitting,\nregardless of whether\nor not they sit\nwith their ankle on their\nopposite knee or with knees\nspread, the classic man spread\nstance, or any other kind\nof seated stance is\ngoing to increase\nthe temperature of the\nscrotum for reasons that\nare somewhat\nobvious if you think\nabout the architecture\nof all this.\nI think both men and women, if\nyou put enough thought to it,\nyou go, oh yeah, that would\nincrease the temperature.\nObviously avoid seat heaters\nin cars or otherwise.\nBut reducing the total amount\nof time that you spend seated\nis really important if you\nwant to keep the temperature\nmilieu of the scrotum\noptimal for sperm quality\nand fertilization.\nAnd as I mentioned\nearlier, it's going\nto be important to make\nsure that your legs are not\nreally big to the point\nwhere they are creating\na hotter than is healthy\nenvironment for the scrotum\nand testicles.\nSo a hotter than normal\nenvironment for the testicles\ncan be caused by legs\nthat are very large,\nupper thighs that are very\nlarge due to obesity or due\nto those upper thighs\nbeing too muscular.\nSo by all means,\ndon't skip leg day.\nBut be aware that if\nyou're somebody who's\ntrying to conceive,\nyou want to do whatever\nyou can to reduce the\ntemperature of the scrotum\nor at least not let it\nget too hot for too long.\nSo I can think of\nall sorts of reasons\nnow that men are\ngoing to come up with\nto do the man spread\nstance of their knees\nreally far apart, even further\nif they have large legs.\nThat's not a discussion\nwe want to have here,\nand that's not really what\ntoday's discussion is about.\nReally the principle is\nwhat's most important, which\nis to keep the\ntemperature of the scrotum\nand testicles lower than\nthe rest of your body.\nThere's a direct blood flow from\nthe body to the testicle that\nprovides blood flow.\nIt's designed in a way\nthat that blood pathway\nshould be outside the\nbody and as far away\nfrom the body as\npossible in order\nto get the temperature\nmilieu of the scrotum\nand testicle correct for\nhealthy sperm quality.\nNow, a topic that is sure\nto be a bit controversial--\nbut it really shouldn't\nbe because the data,\nat least to me, are very clear--\nis this issue of phone\nuse and sperm quality.\nNow, this can open up a\nwhole array of issues related\nto things like EMFs,\nand you've got people\nout there who have ideas about\n5G and all of this stuff.\nThat is not what this\ndiscussion is about.\nThe discussion I'm about to have\nwith you relates to the fact\nthat the electromagnetic fields\nand the heat-related effects\nof smartphones can indeed\nhave a detrimental effect\non sperm quality and, yes,\nindeed, on testosterone levels\nas well.\nI'm going to refer\nyou to a paper.\nWe will link it in the\nshow note captions.\nThe title of this paper is\n\"Effects of Mobile Phone\nUsage on Sperm Quality.\nNo time-dependent\nrelationship on usage.\nA systematic review and\nupdated meta-analysis.\"\nThis is the paper\nthat came out in 2021\nand talks about the fact\nthat phones emit a radio\nfrequency electromagnetic\nwaves, which\nare called RF, radio frequency,\nEMWs, electromagnetic waves,\nat a low level between 80\nand 2,200 megahertz that\ncan be absorbed by the\nhuman body-- we know this.\nThis is not controversial-- and\nhave potential adverse effects\non brain, heart,\nendocrine system,\nand reproductive function.\nThat has been established.\nKeep in mind, there is\nbasically no controversy\nthat radio frequency\nwaves and EMFs\ncan have a negative impact\non biological tissues.\nThe question is, how intense\nare those radiofrequency waves\nand EMFs, and how\ndetrimental are those\non those biological tissues?\nIt's a matter of degrees.\nBut there is very\nlittle controversy as to\nwhether or not they have an\neffect on biological tissues.\nAnd I'm aware of absolutely\nzero data showing\nthat they can have a positive\neffect on biological tissues.\nSince what we're mainly talking\nabout now are smartphones,\nwe want to separate out the\nheat effects of smartphones\nfrom the EMFs\nrelated to the fact\nthat they are Wi-Fi\nsmartphones or they're\nusing cellular\ntowers and Wi-Fi, one\nor the other or a combination.\nSo there are a number of\ndifferent things in the phone\nthat could be detrimental.\nWe need to separate those out.\nWhy?\nWell, because you\nmight have heard\nthat carrying your\nphone in your pocket\ncan reduce your testosterone\nlevels and sperm count.\nAnd guess what, that is true.\nThe data contained\nwithin this meta-analyses\nand other meta-analyses\nclearly point out\nthat it can reduce sperm count\nand maybe testosterone levels\nsignificantly, but certainly\nsperm count and motility\nsignificantly.\nIt reduces sperm quality.\nSo should you avoid putting your\nphone in your pocket, certainly\nyour front pocket?\nI would suggest yes,\nif you are somebody\nwho is seeking to conceive.\nI'm not somebody who is going\nto stop using my smartphone.\nI don't expect anyone's going\nto stop using their smartphone.\nThe question is, should you\ncarry it in your front pocket\nif you're a male?\nI think, to be on the\nsafe side, the answer\nis probably avoid doing\nthat too much of the time.\nIdeally, don't do it at all.\nThen people will say, well,\nwhat if I turn off the Wi-Fi\nor I turn off the\ncellular access?\nThen is it still a problem?\nWell, it's a problem due to\nthe heat-related effects.\nAnd then people say,\nwell, I don't actually\nfeel the heat of the phone.\nIt doesn't get that warm.\nBut the temperature effects\nof the phone, it turns out,\nare enough, even under\nconditions in which people\ndon't report it to be\nuncomfortably warm, that it can\nchange the temperature\nmilieu of the testicle\nin ways that can\ndiminish sperm quality.\nHow much and how that\nrelates to fertility\nand healthy pregnancy,\nnot clear, but since we're\ntalking about things\nto avoid, if your goal\nis to have a healthy\nfertilization and pregnancy,\nwell, then, by all means,\njust don't carry it\nin your front pocket.\nThen people say, well,\nwhat about back pocket\nor what about backpack?\nLook, it's very\nclear that avoiding\nbeing too close to the phone is\nprobably better for your sperm\nquality than putting the phone\nvery close to your testicles\nor anywhere else on your body.\nBut it's also the reality\nthat most people are going\nto carry a phone nowadays.\nIt's just the reality.\nI think the current estimates--\nand it's discussed in this\npaper-- that 90% of the human\npopulation has a smartphone--\n90%, which is incredible-- the\nadult population, of course.\nAlthough a lot of kids\nhave them, as well.\nSo this paper goes on to detail\na number of different studies\nand outcomes from studies.\nBut basically what they find--\nand here I'm paraphrasing--\nis that the data indicate\nthat sperm quality declines\nwhen people start\nusing a mobile phone.\nSo from the point they\nstart using a mobile phone,\nregardless of the usage\ntime-- this is important.\nIt used to be thought that it\nwas four hours a day or more\nof holding your phone or having\nthat phone close to your body\nwas going to diminish\nsperm quality.\nIt turns out that it's\nnot related to usage time.\nThat's even the\ntitle of the paper.\nIt's just the fact\nthat people are\nusing mobile phones is reducing\nsperm count and quality.\nThat's the reality.\nIs it entirely responsible for\nall the reductions in sperm\nquality and maybe\neven the reductions\nin testosterone levels that\nwe're observing from decade\nto decade going forward?\nI doubt that's the case.\nIs it likely to be one\nof the major players?\nI've got my bet on the fact\nthat it is based on the data\nthat I've observed.\nAnd so if any of you\nwould like to peruse\nthe data in this meta-analysis,\nthey're quite good.\nThis study looked at 18 studies\nthat include 4,280 samples.\nThey were able to\nseparate out the radio\nfrequency versus\nthe heat effects,\nand they were able to eliminate\nthis time of usage variable,\nthat previously we thought\nif you were exposed\nto a lot of cell\nphone contact, then\nit was far worse than if you\nwere exposed to a little bit.\nTurns out, if you're\nexposed to any at all,\nyou're going to\ndiminish sperm quality.\nWhat does that mean?\nDoes that mean\nthat no matter what\nyou do, if you own a\nsmartphone, that you're going\nto diminish sperm quality?\nI think the short answer is yes,\nbut that you can mitigate it.\nWhat might you do?\nWell, keeping your phone away\nfrom your groin or as far\nfrom your groin as\npossible if you're\na male who's wishing to\nconceive and maybe even a male\nwho's wishing to maximize his\ntestosterone levels because it\ndoes appear that radiofrequency\nwaves and the heat\nfrom the phone--\nso both of those factors,\nindependently and together,\nof course--\ncan disrupt the Leydig\ncells of the testes\nand the production\nof testosterone,\nand intratesticular\ntestosterone is\nimportant for sperm production.\nThe exact biological variables\nleading to all of these changes\nisn't exactly clear.\nBut if you're like\nme, you say, OK,\nprobably not a problem for most\nmales to carry their phone.\nBut probably best to not\ncarry it in the front pocket.\nMaybe even avoid carrying it\nin the back pocket as well.\nAgain, in the future,\nwe will have an episode\nall about Bluetooth.\nWe'll talk about\nvarious aspects of EMFs.\nIt's a super\ninteresting data set.\nAnd it's a data set for which\nthere's a ton of controversy.\nIt's really\ninteresting, however,\nand there are more and more\nquality data coming out\nall the time.\nAnd I think, going\nforward, we are\ngoing to see that, indeed,\nthere are some negative effects\nof smartphones related to\nboth the radio frequency\ntransmission and the fact\nthat they generate heat.\nAnd in general, heat is not\ngood for biological tissues.\nSo any discussion\nabout heat and sperm\nand how heat is\ndetrimental to sperm\nhas to raise this\nissue of whether or not\ncold is good for the testicle.\nOK, well, now there's\na lot of data starting\nto come out about\nthe positive effects,\nthe positive biological effects,\nof deliberate cold exposure\non different aspects\nof brain biology,\nsuch as the release of\ndopamine and norepinephrine,\nand on the biology of the\nbody, to some extent metabolism\nbut more so the impact on\nbrown fat stores, which\nare good for us, so-called\nbrown fat thermogenesis.\nThere's a lot related to\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nand we've done entire episodes\non deliberate cold exposure.\nAgain, you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nWe did a guest\nepisode with an expert\non the use of cold for\nhealth and performance\nwith my colleague Craig Heller\nfrom Stanford Department\nof Biology.\nWe also have a toolkit on how to\napply deliberate, cold exposure\nfor health for both\nfemales and for males--\nfor sports performance,\ncognitive performance, mood,\nsleep, et cetera.\nYou can find all that,\nagain, at hubermanlab.com.\nTotally zero cost.\nJust go into the menu, go to\nnewsletter, and scroll down,\nand you'll find those.\nWhen thinking about\nsperm quality,\nwe want remember that\nexcessive heat is bad.\nNow, does that mean that\ndeliberate cold is good?\nWell, it turns out that one\nof the major causes of lowered\nsperm count and overall\nreduced sperm quality that's\nquite common is the presence\nof what's called a varicocele.\nA varicocele is kind of like\nvaricose veins of the veins\nthat innervate the testicle.\nAnd what it\nessentially does is it\nmeans that blood will pool\nin the testicular region.\nIt can't circulate back to\nthe body quickly enough.\nAnd therefore, the temperature\nof that environment increases.\nThere are some other\nthings that varicoceles\ndo which can be obstructive\nat the physical level.\nSo they're not just\ntemperature related.\nIt's pretty clear that using\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan be healthy for the\nsperm because of the ways\nnot that cold directly supports\ntestosterone or sperm quality\nbut rather because\ncold reduces heat.\nSo you will find\navailable online--\nI think they're\nactually called--\nforgive me, but that's\nwhat they're called.\nI didn't name them--\ncalled snowballs.\nThese are-- they're sort of\nlike gel pack cold briefs\nthat you can buy and men will\nwear for some period of time.\nI don't think you\nwear them all day.\nYou wear them for\nsome period of time.\nA lot of people are now using\ncold showers and ice baths\nand circulating cold baths\nor going into a cold ocean\nor lake for any number\nof different reasons\nI talked about earlier.\nI, myself, start every\nday with either a one\nto three-minute\ncold shower or a one\nto three-minute\nimmersion up to my neck\nin a cold bath, cold\nwater, circulating water,\nor a cold shower.\nI do that mainly for the\npsychological effects\nrelated to the long\nlasting increases\nin dopamine and epinephrine.\nBut there are\nother data starting\nto come out showing that\nthat sort of approach\nor similar approaches can\nincrease testosterone levels\nand maybe even sperm\ncounts, can reduce\ncortisol late in the evening if\nthe cold exposure is done early\nin the day, so on and so forth.\nSo a lot of interesting data\ncoming out in really good\njournals that are peer-reviewed\nand so on-- in humans,\nI should mention, those\nstudies are done in humans--\nto support the use of\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nBut again, if you're going to\nuse deliberate cold exposure\nto improve sperm\nquality, can it work?\nYes, indeed, it can\nwork, either indirectly\nby increasing\ntestosterone or directly\nby improving sperm quality.\nBut both of those effects\nare likely to be indirect\nby virtue of reducing the\ntemperature of the testicle\noverall, not because there's\nany sort of magic effect of cold\non the testicle.\nNow, I have to imagine\nthat a number of you,\nin particular the females\nlistening to this,\nare going to say, is\ndeliberate cold exposure--\nand for that matter, is\ndeliberate heat exposure,\nlike sauna or hot tub--\ngood or bad for the ovary,\nfor eggs, and for fertility?\nNow, there are fewer data\nto look to, unfortunately.\nBut what we do know is that\ndeliberate cold exposure\ndone in the way that\nI just described-- one\nto three minutes a day,\nideally early in the day,\nthrough cold shower or\nimmersion up to the neck--\ndoesn't have to be an ice bath.\nIt could be cold\ncirculating water or even\nnon-circulating cold water.\nAnd people will\nsay, well, how cold?\nI should have\nmentioned that before.\nHow cold?\nThere is no way I can\ntell you exactly how\ncold the water should be,\nbecause for some people,\n60 degrees Fahrenheit\nwill be exceedingly cold.\nFor other people, 40 degrees is\ngoing to be more appropriate.\nHow cold should you make it?\nIf you're going to embrace\nthese practices, you want--\naccording to the literature,\nwhat you want to do\nis make it\nuncomfortably cold such\nthat you really want\nto get out, but safe.\nYou don't want to go into\n30-degree water immediately.\nYou can actually have a heart\nattack and die if you do that.\nSo you want to progress\ngradually into the cold.\nSo you don't want to shock\nyour system too much.\nAlthough it is the adrenaline\nevoked by that [GASPS],,\nthat quickening or\nshortening or elimination\nof the breath for a\nshort period of time\nwhen you get into\nuncomfortably cold water that\ncorrelates with or is\nactually the reflection of--\nwould be more accurate to\nsay-- the release of adrenaline\nand then dopamine\nand so forth, which\nhas been very well documented.\nSo uncomfortably cold,\nbut safe to stay in.\nAnd I cannot tell you an exact\nnumber that is uncomfortably\ncold but safe for you.\nIt's going to differ\nperson by person.\nYou want to figure that out.\nJust like I can't tell you how\nmuch weight that you should\nsquat in order to achieve\nsome effective resistance\ntraining for the\nlegs, it's going\nto differ depending\non your strength\nand your prior\nexperience and so forth.\nSo ease into it.\nBe safe.\nBut it does appear\nthat both for men,\nfor reasons I talked about a\nfew minutes ago, and for women\nthat deliberate, cold\nexposure can be beneficial\nfor fertility and for\nhormone production,\nbut in particular for females\nin terms of regulating cortisol\nand for hormone production.\nNow, you might say, OK,\ngetting into cold is stressful.\nHow can that be helpful\nfor regulating stress?\nWell, it turns out, when\nyou get into the cold,\nyou get a big\nsurge in adrenaline\nand then dopamine, which\nis very long lasting,\nprovided that's done in\nthe early part of the day.\nSo I would say, not\ntoo close to sleep.\nThen what you do is you restrict\nyour maximum cortisol release\nto a period earlier in\nthe day that buffers--\nreduces, that is--\nthe likelihood\nthat you would have excessive\namounts of cortisol later\nin the day, which not\nonly can disrupt sleep\nbut is correlated with a number\nof other hormonal effects that\nare not good for\nus and therefore\nnot good for fertility.\nSo here what I'm\ndescribing are positive\nyet indirect effects of\na cold on hormone levels\nboth in males and in females.\nSo for men, we talked about\nincreased testosterone,\nimproved sperm quality\nthat was indirect.\nYou're reducing the\ntemperature of the testicle.\nBut it's not that cold\nitself is positively\nimpacting those things.\nDoes that make sense?\nHeat is bad.\nTherefore, reducing\ntemperature is good.\nLikewise, with females,\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan be good for the\noverall fertility process,\nnot because cold is good\nfor the ovary or being\ncold is good for the ovary\nor for luteinizing hormone\nor for follicle-stimulating\nhormone or anything\nelse like that, but rather that\nusing deliberate cold exposure\nas a way to restrict\nstress in a deliberate\nway to a particular\ntime of day increases\nthe release of cortisol,\nthen, and indirectly reduces\nthe amount of cortisol\nthat's released\nat other times along\nthe 24-hour cycle.\nSo these are positive\nyet indirect effects.\nSo if you're a woman who really\nis interested in exploring\ndeliberate cold exposure or\nwho enjoys it or is already\ndoing it and you're\nwishing to conceive, great.\nExplore it.\nDo it safely, of\ncourse, but explore it\nand continue to do it.\nHowever, if you're somebody\nwho just hates the cold\nand doesn't want to\ngo anywhere near it,\nthere's no reason to think\nthat you absolutely need it,\nprovided that your stress,\nyour sleep, and other factors\nare all being\ncarried out properly.\nThe next things that\nwe'll talk about\nin terms of positive\nthings or things\nthat we can do in order\nto maximize fertility\nfor both females and\nmales are the things\nthat you also generally\nhear about elsewhere.\nRight along with sleep and\navoiding alcohol and avoiding\nnicotine and avoiding cannabis,\navoiding excessive heat\nfor the testicle,\navoiding excessive stress,\nis that you want to try\nto get enough exercise.\nWhy would exercise have\nanything to do with any of this?\nWell, exercise-- and that\nis both a combination\nof resistance training and\ncardiovascular exercise--\nis going to improve the\nhealth of the mitochondria--\nin particular,\ncardiovascular exercise.\nAnd I realize that for you\nfitness experts out there,\nany time someone says \"cardio,\"\npeople kind of roll their eyes,\nlike, what is that?\nThere's endurance training.\nThere's interval training.\nThere's HIIT training.\nThere's sprints.\nThere's all sorts\nof different things.\nSome of those overlap.\nSome of them are separate.\nIndeed, that's the case.\nBut we can use a general\nrule of thumb here, which\nis that, for most people,\ngetting anywhere from 30\nand ideally 45 to 60\nminutes of exercise per day\nfor six days per week,\nmaybe even seven--\nbut most people like to\ntake a day off or need\nto take a complete\nday off each week--\nsix to seven days\nper week is going\nto be good for mitochondrial\nhealth and function.\nIt's also going to impact\nall the other things,\nlike quality sleep,\nmood, reducing stress,\nand so on and so forth.\nSo exercise we can handle pretty\nquickly by just saying everyone\nshould be doing it.\nNow, when people are pregnant,\nthey might have to, of course,\nchange the amount of exercise\nor the type of exercise\nthat they're doing.\nThere are varying\nopinions on that,\nbut certainly the type of\nexercise and the amount\ncan vary when\npeople are pregnant.\nBut if you're\nseeking to conceive,\ngetting enough exercise\nis good because it's\ngood for the mitochondria.\nThe mitochondria are present in\nthat mid region of the sperm.\nAnd mitochondria are critical\nfor chromosomal segregation\nand the spindle\nand other aspects\nof the formation of a\nhealthy egg, ovulation,\nand fertilization in the female.\nOne thing that I\nknow a lot of people\nare interested in nowadays is\nso-called intermittent fasting\nor time-restricted feeding.\nI mean, let's be fair, everybody\nis restricting their feeding\ntime because hopefully\neverybody is sleeping\nat some point in\nthe 24-hour cycle,\nand nobody is eating\nwhile they are sleeping.\nThat said, many\npeople are employing\na so-called eight-hour feeding\nwindow or a 10-hour feeding\nwindow or a 12-hour\nfeeding window.\nAnd indeed, there are some data\nto support the idea that that\ncan be a good thing for a number\nof different biological and\nhealth parameters.\nHowever, there are\nalso a lot of data,\nespecially recently,\npointing to the fact\nthat your overall\nnumber of calories\nand the quality of\nyour food sources\nis going to be the most\nimportant variable.\nAnd some people simply find\nthat time-restricted feeding--\nintermittent fasting,\nas it's also called--\nis just a convenient\nway to ensure\nthat your total\nintake of calories\nis not excessive\nfor what you need.\nNow, with all that\nsaid, there is evidence\nthat I've covered\nin a solo episode\nand will soon have\nan expert guest\non showing that time-restricted\nfeeding can have\ncertain positive outcomes\nfor various aspects of organ,\ncellular, and tissue health.\nThis is somewhat\ncontroversial, but there\nis growing evidence that,\nby restricting your feeding\nwindow to, say, 8 hours\nor 10 hours or 12 hours,\nthat it is better than if\nyou were to eat over a longer\nperiod of each 24-hour cycle.\nBut again, the data\nare still incoming.\nThe reason we want to talk\nabout time-restricted feeding,\nintermittent fasting\nis that a lot of people\ndo use it because\nthey find it easier\nto not eat at certain periods\nof their 24-hour cycle\nthan to restrict calories.\nBut again, keep in mind, you\nhave to restrict calories\nif your goal is to\nmaintain or lose\nweight, a discussion\nthat we've covered\nin that episode on\nintermittent fasting\nand in the episode\nwith Dr. Layne Norton\nand that we will cover in\nother episodes in the future.\nSo refer to those episodes\nat hubermanlab.com\nif you would like to learn more\nabout intermittent fasting,\nper se.\nFor sake of this conversation,\na number of people\nare probably asking, if\nI restrict my feeding\nto a certain window each\n24 hours because that's\nwhat's convenient or\nbecause I'm excited\nabout the potential\npositive effects\nof intermittent\nfasting, is that going\nto disrupt the likelihood\nof fertility and thereby\na healthy pregnancy?\nAnd the short answer to\nthat is, if you are a female\nand you are having regular\nmenstrual cycles that\nis a fairly\nconsistent duration--\nso maybe it's 21\ndays, maybe it's\n35, or anywhere in\nbetween, but it's\nfairly consistent\nfrom month to month--\nand you are following\nintermittent fasting,\ntime-restricted\nfeeding, well, then\nchances are pretty\ngood that it's not\ndisrupting your fertility and\nlikelihood of fertilization\nand a healthy pregnancy.\nOf course, during pregnancy,\nyou need to talk to your doctor\nand make sure that you're\neating in a way that's\nsupportive both of you and\nof the developing fetus.\nThat's extremely important.\nI am not aware of\ndata exploring,\nin a regimented way,\ntime-restricted feeding\nduring pregnancy.\nSo please, please, please,\nif you're pregnant,\ndo not jump on a\ntime-restricted feeding,\nso-called intermittent\nfasting diet.\nTalk to your OB/GYN.\nTalk to your doctor.\nTalk to multiple\ndoctors, for that matter,\nbefore doing anything like\nthat, because, of course,\nyou're now eating for two, or\nif you have twins in there,\nyou're eating for three.\nVery important.\nIf, however, you're\nnot yet pregnant\nand you want to be fertile, get\npregnant, or simply maintain\na fertile potential\nand biology and you're\nfollowing intermittent\nfasting, it's\ngoing to be the regularity of\nthose periods and regularity\nof cycle length that will\ntell you whether or not\nthat's a good idea or not.\nKeeping in mind, of course,\nthat if your total number\nof calories is too low,\nyour periods will cease.\nThat's a well-known effect.\nBut of course, stress\ncan also induce\ncessation of menstruation.\nAnd there are other factors\nthat can induce cessation\nof menstruation as well.\nSome of them start with changes\nin the brain, literally,\nin the hypothalamus.\nSome occur in the pituitary.\nMany lifestyle\nfactors can do that.\nBut most typically,\nit's going to be\nexcessive caloric\nrestriction or it's\ngoing to be a caloric\ndeficit brought on\nby excess physical activity.\nSo even if someone's\neating a lot,\nif they're not eating enough to\noffset their physical activity\nor they're not eating\nenough of, in particular,\nfats, the essential\nfatty acids and protein,\nbut also carbohydrates, well,\nthen menstruation can cease.\nAnd of course, if\nmenstruation is ceasing,\nchances are, almost\nwith certainty,\nthat you're not getting\nregular ovulations.\nNow, in terms of males\nand whether or not\nintermittent fasting\nis going to disrupt\nspermatogenesis and\ntestosterone production,\nthere's essentially no\ndata we can look to.\nBut we can look to\nthe general logic\naround the relationship\nbetween body fat, testosterone,\nand spermatogenesis.\nAnd this was something\nthat was covered\nin a discussion I had on\noptimization of hormone\nhealth for males that I\nhad with Dr. Kyle Gillette,\nwho's a medical doctor\nand obesity specialist.\nAgain, you find that\nepisode at hubermanlab.com\nif you want to learn all about\nhormone optimization in males.\nAnd essentially, the\nstory is as follows.\nIf a male is\nexcessively overweight,\nhe's carrying too much body\nfat in particular, not too\nmuch muscle--\nalthough that can\nbe an issue too,\nbut too much body fat\nis typically the issue--\nso more than, say,\n20% body fat--\nwell, then losing\nbody fat is going\nto be the primary goal for\nmaximizing testosterone, sperm\nhealth, and spermatogenesis.\nIf, however, a male is already\nlean, well, then actually\nincreasing calories will\nincrease testosterone.\nSo it's a bit of a\ncomplicated story,\nalthough not so complicated that\nnone of us can understand it.\nBasically, if you're\noverweight, you\nshould focus on losing weight in\norder to maximize sperm quality\nand health.\nIf you are very lean, well,\nthen restricting your calories\nto the point where you are\nstarting to lose weight\nor you're dropping\neven more body fat\nis unlikely to increase\nyour testosterone further.\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmean it's bad\nor that you shouldn't\ntry and go, for instance,\nfrom 15% to 10% body fat.\nI'm not saying that\nthat's bad and that\nwill reduce your testosterone.\nBut in general,\nif you're already\nvery lean-- so 10%\nbody fat, 5% body\nfat-- and you start\nrestricting calories further,\nyour testosterone\nlevels will drop.\nSo in the context of\nintermittent fasting,\nit's really not an\nissue of whether or not\nyour feeding window is\n8 hours or 12 hours.\nIt's really an issue\nof whether or not\nyou're getting enough calories\nto offset the physical demands\nand activities of your\nlife, whether or not\nyou're on a maintenance diet\nto maintain your weight.\nAnd of course, you have to\nput all that in the context of\nwhether or not you're overweight\nor lean to begin with.\nThe simple thing to\ntake away from this\nis, if you're a\nmale who's using--\nbecause you like it--\nintermittent fasting,\nso-called\ntime-restricted feeding,\nand you're following an\neight hour or maybe even\na one meal per day\ntype approach--\nalthough I don't\nreally recommend\nthat for a number of reasons\nwe could talk about separately.\nIf you're eating over the course\nof 8 or 10 or 12 hours per day\nbecause that's what works\nfor you and you are ingesting\nenough calories to maintain\nyour weight if you're already\nlean or you are\ningesting fewer calories\nthan you are burning in order\nto lose weight because you are\nalready overweight and\nyou want to lose body fat,\nyou're probably optimizing\nfor all the things\nthat you need to do in order\nto improve sperm quality\nand testosterone levels.\nNow, also in that\nepisode that I did\nwith Dr. Kyle Gillette on\noptimizing hormones for males,\nwe talked about testosterone\nreplacement therapy.\nIt's not a topic I want to get\ninto in any detail right now.\nBut I will say this.\nRemember earlier when we were\ntalking about spermatogenesis\nand the fact that in order\nfor sperm to be generated\nconsistently every month\nongoing from the time of puberty\nuntil essentially the\ntime that a man dies,\nyou need two things.\nYou need testosterone\nproduction from the Leydig cells\nof the testes, and you\nneed spermatogenesis\nto be supported by that\nandrogen-binding protein\ncoming from the support\ncells, from the Sertoli cells.\nSo you need\ntestosterone, and you\nneed androgen-binding protein,\nand you need the Leydig cells\nand the Sertoli cells active.\nWhen men take exogenous,\nmeaning from outside the body,\ntestosterone, either by cream or\nby patch or by pellets or more\ntypically by injection--\nthe most typical TRT\napproach nowadays is\ntestosterone cypionate, which\nis biologically identical\nto the kind of testosterone\nyou would make.\nWell, because of negative\nfeedback loops, which you also\nlearned about\nearlier, the testicles\nthemselves shut down their\nown testosterone production.\nWhy would that be?\nOK, so you're taking\ntestosterone in by syringe\nor by patch or any other method.\nSo the circulating testosterone\nand the amount that\narrives at the testicle\nis going to be hopefully\nclinically appropriate,\nnot super physiological,\nbut it'll be somewhere in\nthe healthy reference range,\nmaybe a little bit higher.\nNowadays, some people are\ngoing a little bit higher.\nSo we're not talking about\nfull blown, quote, unquote,\n\"anabolic steroid\nuse,\" keeping in mind,\nof course, that\nestrogen is a steroid.\nTestosterone is a steroid.\nBut when we think\nabout steroids,\nwe mean like\nperformance-enhancing drugs, so\nsuper physiological doses.\nWe're talking about\nwithin physiological\nor near physiological ranges.\nSo if someone's taking\ntheir testosterone\nin from an outside,\nexogenous, source,\nthe levels of\ncirculating testosterone\nwill be sufficiently\nhigh that the pituitary\nwill register that and will\nstop making luteinizing hormone\nand generally\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nas well.\nAnd as a consequence,\nspermatogenesis\nis vastly reduced or eliminated.\nIn other words, for men\nwho are on TRT or who\nare taking testosterone\nfrom an external source,\nthe number of sperm that\nthey're going to make\nis going to be\ndramatically reduced.\nThere are things that they\ncan do to offset that,\nlike taking hCG, human chorionic\ngonadotropin, which is just\nkind of a mimic for\nluteinizing hormone\nto stimulate the testes to\ncontinue to make testosterone.\nAnd some men will also--\nor instead-- take FSH to\nstimulate the Sertoli cells\nto support spermatogenesis--\nexcuse me--\nor both or some combination.\nSome people take\nclomiphene, Clomid.\nThere are any number\nof different ways\nto bypass or offset the\nsperm-reducing effects\nof taking exogenous\ntestosterone.\nThis is a conversation\nthat was covered\nin a fair amount of detail in\nthat episode with Dr. Gillette.\nBut just keep in mind that if\nyou are taking testosterone\nfrom an exogenous source, your\nsperm counts will dramatically\nbe reduced, unless you do\nsomething to offset it.\nSo if you are\nwishing to conceive,\nyou need to think\nabout whether or not\nyou're going to offset the\ntestosterone replacement\ntherapy or whether or not you're\ngoing to come off it entirely.\nSo you'll need to talk to\na urologist endocrinologist\nabout that.\nAnd again, a number of these\ndifferent themes and ways\nto go about tapering\noff TRT were\ncovered in that episode\nwith Dr. Kyle Gillette.\nSo if you're on TRT or\nyou're considering taking it\nand you're interested\nin having children,\nnot just now but at\nany point, you really\nwant to take these things\ninto consideration.\nNow, I do want to point out\nthat, for the number of you\nout there who are taking\nsupplements, some of which\nwe've talked about\non this podcast\nand I've talked about in other\npodcasts, such as tongkat ali--\nit turns out that there\nare a lot of men and women\ntaking tongkat ali to reduce\nsex hormone binding globulin\nlevels, to increase testosterone\nand estrogen, in some cases,\nlibido and so forth.\nThose approaches, meaning\nsupplement-based approaches,\nto increase testosterone\nor free testosterone\nor some related\nhormones, are not\ngoing to shut down your\nown endogenous testosterone\nproduction and reduce the\nnumber of sperm that you make\nor, at least as far as we\nknow, disrupt ovulation\nin any kind of way,\nprovided that the dosages\nare within normal ranges.\nAgain, supplementation\nto support your hormones\nshould not disrupt\novulation or spermatogenesis\nor testosterone production.\nQuite the opposite.\nIt should enhance it.\nWhat I just described\naround TRT as taking\nexogenous testosterone,\nthat itself\nis an entirely different beast.\nNow, with all of\nthat said, there\nare some supplements\nout there that\ninclude testosterone\nas a ingredient that's\nbeen snuck in to various\nformulas that include\nblends and things of that sort.\nYou want to be aware of that.\nAnd we did an episode about\nhow to develop a rational guide\nto supplementation.\nI highly recommend\nlistening to that episode.\nAgain, it's timestamped,\navailable free\nat hubermanlab.com\nin all formats.\nBecause it talks about\nwhich supplements\nare likely to be\n\"clean,\" quote, unquote,\nto contain the things that\nyou expect them to contain,\nthere's more and more\nevidence coming out that\na lot of supplements,\nincluding some--\nfor instance,\nsupplements that contain\ntesticle or the\nextracts of testicles\ncan contain testosterone.\nWhether or not they can shut\ndown your own endogenous\ntestosterone\nproduction isn't clear.\nNo one's really\nexplored that in detail.\nBut based on everything we\njust talked about with TRT,\nit stands to reason that it\nmight either reduce it or shut\nit down.\nIt's just never\nbeen explored yet.\nSo by all means, make sure\nthat what you're taking\nif you're taking supplements.\nBut again, the\nmajor point here is\nthat, for both\nfemales and males,\ntaking supplements to\nsupport healthy hormone\nproduction, including\nthings like tongkat ali,\nis not the same as taking\nhormones or bioidentical\nhormones, which indeed can\nshut down your own endogenous\nproduction of\nhormones and thereby\nreduce both egg quality and\nthe chance of fertilization\nand healthy pregnancy\nand sperm quality\nand the chance of fertilization\nand healthy pregnancy.\nAny time there's a discussion\nabout fertility and pregnancy,\nthere seems to also be\na parallel discussion\nabout sex determination.\nThat is, what factors can\ninfluence whether or not\nthe child that's born\nis male or female.\nThat is, whether or not it has\ndouble X chromosomes-- so one X\nchromosome from mom, one\nX chromosome from dad\nbecause the egg was\nfertilized by a sperm that\nhad an X sex chromosome,\nthat 23rd chromosome--\nor whether or not the offspring\nis male, whether or not\nit has the X chromosome from\nmom, because it's always going\nto be the X chromosome\nin that egg,\nand a Y chromosome\nfrom the sperm that\nfertilized that particular egg.\nNow, of course, there\nare instances out\nthere of people that have XXY\nchromosomes or XYY chromosomes.\nBut the vast majority\nof people out there\nare going to have either\nan XX chromosome-- so we\ncall that a female karyotype.\nThis is different than\ngenotype and phenotype,\nbut a female karyotype\nwould be XX--\nor a male karyotype,\nwhich would be XY.\nNow, despite the fact that\nit is the egg and the sperm\nand the chromosomes\nthat they carry\nthat are going to\ndetermine the chromosomes,\nthere's a lot of lore and\ndiscussion about the factors\nthat can bias which sperm\nwill fertilize the egg\nand thereby whether\nor not you're\ngoing to get an XX, female,\nor an XY, male, chromosome\nand therefore offspring.\nNow, not only is the lore\naround this whole issue of sex\ndetermination rather prominent,\nbut it is also somewhat unusual\nand perhaps even interesting.\nSo for instance,\nAristotle himself proposed\nthat if a man is thinking about\nhimself and his own pleasure\nmore than his partner\nand her pleasure\nat the point of\nejaculation, then\nthe offspring will be male.\nAristotle also asserted\nthat if a man is thinking\nmore about his partner\nand her pleasure\nat the point in which he\nejaculates, well, then\nthe offspring would be female.\nAnd of course, we\nhave zero reason\nto believe that there's any\ntruth to Aristotle's theory.\nThere are no data\nto support that.\nIn fact, I'm not\neven sure how you\nwould run that experiment\nbecause you can't really\nlook at people's thoughts.\nYou'd have to rely on\nhonest self-report.\nAnd even if people were\nto faithfully report\nwhat they were thinking about\nat the moment of ejaculation,\nthis would involve, of\ncourse, bringing people\ninto the laboratory and\nsomehow measuring or analyzing\ntheir thoughts or\ngathering their thoughts\nduring the sexual intercourse\nat the point of ejaculation,\nthen figuring out which\nbiological sex was\nthe offspring, et cetera.\nJust near impossible and\nprobably not the most important\nexperiment to invest\nour time doing.\nNonetheless, there\ncontinues to be\na lot of lore about\nwhat determines\nthe sex of the offspring.\nMost notably, there's a\nlot of lore and discussion\nand rumor about the idea that\nparticular sexual positions\nat the point of ejaculation\nduring intercourse\ncan somehow bias the likelihood\nthat a pregnancy will\nbe either resulting in\nmale or female offspring.\nNow, again, there are\nzero data to support this,\nand yet this whole notion\nof sex determination\nis a really interesting\none that people\nseem to be somewhat obsessed\nby, so much so that, again,\nif you go online or\nif you were to talk\nto people in the sort of\nlet's call it holistic\nor peripheral health spaces\nrelated to fertility,\nthere is discussion\nabout, OK, well,\nyou take this sexual position\nat the point of ejaculation\nto get a boy and you\ntake that sexual position\nat the point of\nejaculation to get a girl\nor you do this in the\nearly part of the day\nor the later part of the day.\nAgain, all for\nwhich there is zero\ndata to support any kind\nof systematic relationship\nbetween what I just discussed\nand the biological sex\nof the offspring.\nThat said, there are\nnow emerging methods\nthat people are using in order\nto separate out the sperm that\nwill indeed give rise\nto a male offspring\nversus a female offspring.\nNow, this, of course,\nis done in the context\nof in-vitro fertilization.\nWe haven't talked too much\nabout in-vitro fertilization.\nBut in-vitro\nfertilization involves,\nas the name suggests, taking\nan egg and taking a sperm,\npairing them in a dish.\nThis can be done a\nnumber of different ways.\nBut just to briefly\ndescribe the IVF procedure,\nIVF involves\nadministering supra--\nmeaning greater than normal--\nsupraphysiological levels\nof follicle-stimulating\nhormone and luteinizing hormone\nduring the follicular\nphase of a woman's cycle.\nWhat that causes is the\nmaturation of not just one\negg that would be ovulated but\nmultiple follicles and eggs.\nAnd then ovulation\nitself is suppressed also\nthrough the administration\nof exogenous hormones.\nAnd then, under\nultrasound guidance,\nan OB/GYN goes in and collects\nthe mature eggs and follicles,\nputs them in a\ndish, and then sperm\nare delivered to that dish,\nand those could either\nbe sperm that were\nfrozen previously,\nor more typically or ideally,\nit would be live sperm collected\nthat day that are\nwashed through a very\nstraightforward procedure.\nAnd then those sperm\neither are allowed\nto compete for those eggs\nand fertilize those eggs\nand allow them to advance\nto very early embryo stage\nbefore those embryos are\nfrozen and eventually implanted\ninto a woman in order to have\nthem be carried to full term,\nideally.\nOr there's a procedure in which\nspecific sperm are selected\nbecause they have the\nbest morphology, motility,\nand so forth.\nAnd in a process\ncalled ICSI, I-C-S-I,\nin which the sperm themselves\nare literally forced\nto fertilize that\nparticular egg.\nNow, under those conditions,\ntypically a couple or a woman,\nif she's doing this on her\nown with a sperm donor,\nwill get multiple\nfertilized embryos\nthat are carried to\na multicellular stage\nso that it's clear that\nthey could grow into a child\nif they were implanted\ninto a viable host--\nsometimes the surrogate,\nsometimes the woman\nwho wants the child herself.\nAnd under those\nconditions, it is\npossible to look at\nthe genetic makeup,\nincluding the karyotype,\nof those early nascent\nembryos, in which case\npeople really can select\nthe sex of their offspring.\nThat is, they will have\nsome embryos that are\nXX, some embryos that are XY.\nIt's very likely,\nalso, that they\nwill have some embryos that have\nkaryotypes or genotypes which\nare not ideal in that\nthey would potentially\nlead to a miscarriage or\nsome other genetic defect.\nAnd so, typically,\npeople do not select\nto implant those embryos\nif they have the option\nto implant embryos that are\nof either XX or XY karyotype\nand the normal\nchromosomal arrangements\nfor obvious reasons.\nSo the whole point here is\nthat sex selection is possible,\nbut only using\nin-vitro fertilization.\nThe other thing that\nis becoming clear to us\nin more recent years is that\nsex selection is actually\npossible at the level\nof the sperm even prior\nto fertilization.\nThis is an emerging data\nset, and this is largely\nhappening in clinics outside\nof the United States.\nBut there are some clinics\nthat have figured out methods\nin which they can\ntake a sperm sample\nand they can spin that\nsperm sample in a centrifuge\nat a rate that separates\nout the sperm into what\nare called different fractions.\nSo for those of you who've\ndone a little bit of biology\nwith centrifuge, it's when\nyou spin any kind of substance\nthat includes multiple things\nin it of different weights.\nWhen you spin them, the\nthings of different weights\nsegregate out into\ndifferent fractions\nalong the depth of the tube.\nAnd then you can take out\none fraction or the next\nsimply with a little pipette.\nYou take out the top\nfraction, the middle fraction,\nand so forth.\nAnd what these clinics\nhave figured out\nis that if they spin the sperm\nsample at the correct spin rate\nthat the sperm\nthat will give rise\nto male offspring and the\nsperm that will give rise\nto female offspring segregate\nout into different fractions,\nallowing them to take each\nof those fractions separately\nand to apply them to eggs, if\nit's in-vitro fertilization,\nand give rise very reliably,\ncertainly much more\nthan chance, to either\nmale or female embryos.\nThey also, of course,\ncan choose to do\nthis outside the context\nof in-vitro fertilization.\nSo some people are now opting\nto have their sperm samples spun\nout in this way, separate\nout the sperm that give rise\nto male or female\noffspring, and then\nto only use the fraction\nthat they are interested in--\nso if they want a boy,\nthey'll use one fraction.\nIf they want a girl, they'll\nuse different fraction--\nand then to use those fractions\nin the context of what's\ncalled IUI, or intrauterine\ninsemination, which\nis, as the name suggests, rather\nthan having the man deliver\nthe ejaculate with his penis\nand the sperm with his penis,\nthey have a device.\nThe devices are now\ncommercially sold.\nBelieve it or not, they're\nsold over-the-counter\nand on the internet, so people\nwill even do this at home.\nAnd so what they're doing\nis they'll take the sperm,\nand they'll do IUI in order\nto bias the probability\nthat they're going to get a\nmale or a female offspring.\nAgain, this is something\nthat's now emerging.\nIt's not commonplace.\nMost of the time, people simply\nroll the dice, as it were,\nby having either intercourse\nand just hoping for or not\ncaring if they get a male\nor a female offspring\nor, in the instance\nof IVF, selecting\nmale or female offspring,\nsometimes largely\non the basis of the\nchromosomal arrangements.\nSo of course, some\npeople might prefer\nto have one or the\nother biological sex\nas their offspring.\nBut of course, the healthy\nchromosomal arrangements\nare going to be paramount\nfor getting a healthy child.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nunhealthy chromosomal\narrangements or abnormal\nchromosomal arrangements\noften lead to miscarriage\nand/or birth defects.\nSo selecting for healthy\nchromosomal arrangements\nis always paramount,\nbut some people\nare selecting for\nbiological sex.\nAnd indeed, some couples\nwho can conceive naturally\nare opting for\nIUI in order to be\nable to select biological\nsex because of this ability\nto spin out the sperm samples\nto different fractions\nand select the male\nor female sperm.\nThat is, the sperm\nthat would give rise\nto a male or female offspring.\nSo this is a rapidly emerging\ntheme, believe it or not.\nWho knew?\nAnd of course, it has nothing to\ndo with Aristotle's assertions\nabout what people are\nthinking about at the point\nof ejaculation, nor\ndoes it have anything\nto do with body position at\nthe point of ejaculation.\nBut I do find it\nrather interesting\nthat, even in this\nday and age, people\nseem to be continually\npursuing new and different ways\nto understand why one\nsperm or another sperm\nhappens to fertilize the egg.\nAnd when that information\nis not available,\nbecause, frankly, it's\nnot available yet--\nwe don't know why\na sperm containing\na Y chromosome or a sperm\ncontaining an X chromosome\nis more likely to\nfertilize an egg.\nAnd there are some\nideas, for instance,\nthat older fathers tend to\nhave more daughters as opposed\nto sons.\nBut when you really look at\nthe data, it's pretty mixed.\nSo if you've heard\nthat before, it\nhas a particular nickname\nthat I'm not going\nto describe on the podcast.\nYou can look it up online.\nBut if any of you are aware\nof any other kind of ideals\nor lore, no matter how\nridiculous or crazy, please\nput them in the comment\nsection on YouTube.\nI'd be very curious to learn\nabout those, mostly out\nof interest and curiosity.\nBut, look, sometimes\nthese outrageous stories,\nsuch as notions of body\nposition and how they influence\nbiological sex, even though\nthey turn out not to be true,\nturn out to be interesting\nfor other reasons.\nAnd in fact, next,\nwe're going to talk\nabout how body position\nduring sexual intercourse\ncan, in fact, influence\nfertility and pregnancy.\nSo another common theme\naround fertility and pregnancy\nthat you'll hear about\nis that, for couples\nthat are trying to get pregnant,\nthat during intercourse they\nshould do whatever it\nis that works for them,\nbut then after\nthe man ejaculates\nthat the woman should\ntry and position\nher ankles above her head\nor somehow otherwise tilt\nher pelvis back in order\nto increase the rate and/or\nprobability that the\nsperm swim toward the egg,\nas opposed to the\nother direction.\nNow, I talked to a couple\nof different OB/GYNs\nand urologists that are focused\non fertility about this topic,\nand it turns out you get\npretty mixed answers as to\nwhether or not there's\nany validity to this idea\nthat the woman's body position\nafter the man ejaculates\ninside of her can\nsomehow influence\nthe probability of pregnancy.\nOne group of experts\ntold me that there\nis no reason for a woman\nto need to continue\nto lie down, elevate the\nankles, or in any way\ntilt her pelvis back\nin order to increase\nthe probability of\nsuccessful fertilization.\nThe other group suggested that\nindeed there is a strong reason\nto believe that tilting the\npelvis back, maybe even keeping\nthe ankles elevated,\nand having a woman lie\non her back for about 15 minutes\nwith the pelvis positioned\nat about 20 degrees back\nis ideal for optimizing\nfertilization.\nI mean, they were\nreally specific\nabout the recommendations.\nSo I find this interesting that,\nwithin the cohort of extremely\nwell trained MDs, OB/GYNs\nand urology fertility docs,\nand OB/GYNs, you see a split.\nIt has nothing to do\nwith whether or not\nthe physician was male or\nfemale or their training\nor their institution,\nnone of that.\nThere just seemed to be a sort\nof even split between the two.\nNow, granted, it wasn't\nthe largest sample size\nthat I could have obtained.\nAnd yet I do find it\ninteresting that there's\nthis split in the\nopinion about this.\nOne group, the group that said,\nno, pelvic position doesn't\nreally matter, don't\nworry about it,\nit's not going to influence\nthe rates of fertilization,\nargued that the sperm\nswim very quickly\nand that if they are\nreleased near the cervix\nthey're going to swim very\nquickly toward the egg\nin order to fertilize it\nregardless of pelvic position.\nThe other group said, well,\nyes, sperm swim quickly\nand even if they're\nreleased right at the entry\nto the cervix that the sperm\nstill have a long distance\nto go.\nAgain, if you were to\nscale this according\nto the size of the sperm versus\nthe size of a human body,\nan entire human body,\nwhat you'd scale it to\nis the distance between Los\nAngeles and San Francisco.\nAnd it needs to undergo that\nbasically within 24 hours\nor so.\nAlthough, as we\nmentioned earlier,\nsperm can survive\nquite a while inside\nof the woman's body-- maybe\nthree or five days at least.\nSo in both cases\nthey acknowledge\nit's a long distance.\nBut on the one hand,\nyou have a group\nof experts that are saying the\nsperm more or less know what\nto do and are going\nto do it regardless\nof the position of the woman\nafter ejaculation inside her\nand the other group\nsaying, no, we\nwant to do everything\nwe can to bias\nthe likelihood that the\nsperm will fertilize the egg.\nWell, setting aside\nthe basic argument\nthat tilting back at the pelvis\nand lying stationary or so\nfor about 15 minutes\nafter sexual intercourse\nand ejaculation is not\nan expensive endeavor,\nalthough it requires\na little bit of time.\nAnd it forces people to\nremain motionless or close\nto motionless, and they're not\nup and around and moving about.\nAside from that, it's a\nrelatively low investment.\nSo one argument is,\nwell, if it could\nbias the likelihood of\nfertilization at all\nand people want to get pregnant,\nwhy wouldn't they do that?\nSo that's a reasonable argument.\nBut it doesn't really\npoint to the mechanism.\nThe arguments that point to a\npotential mechanism are that--\nif you recall what we were\ntalking about when we talked\nabout sperm quality,\nsperm quality\ninvolves a bunch of\ndifferent measures,\nlike concentration of sperm\nper milliliter of semen,\nmorphology of those sperm,\nhow many are forward motile.\nIt turns out that in any\none ejaculate sample,\nthe total number of forward\nmotile and yet fast forward\nmotile sperm that are also of\nthe highest quality morphology\nis actually quite low.\nAnd so the idea here\nis that you want\nto get as many sperm\nof the highest quality\nswimming toward the egg because\nthose sperm stand the highest\nprobability of\nfertilizing that egg.\nAnd in fact, this relates to\nsome of the discussion we were\nhaving earlier about behavioral\ndos and don'ts for sake\nof increasing the\nprobability of fertilization.\nAnd the one that is most\nimportant here is cannabis.\nIt turns out that\nthe data on cannabis\nreally do support the\nidea that some of you\nmay have heard from\nparents and teachers--\nI don't know, I did hear this\nfrom parents and teachers--\nthat cannabis can disrupt\nthe swimming styles of sperm\nin ways that are not\nsupportive of fertilization,\nthat it can turn more of\nthe sperm into twitchers.\nAlthough when I\nlearned about this,\nI was not informed of\nthe word \"twitchers.\"\nWhat I was told is that,\nif you use cannabis,\nthat the sperm don't know\nwhich direction to go,\nthat they're confused,\nalmost implying\nthat the sperm themselves\nare high on cannabis.\nWell, that's certainly not the\nargument that I'm making here.\nBut it does seem to be\nthe case that people\nwho use cannabis, even once,\nthe sperm that are generated\nduring that particular month\nor two months during which\nor after which they\nuse cannabis have\nless forward motility and\npossibly altered morphology,\nas well.\nI want to be very\nclear, I did not\nsay that if you use cannabis\nonce you are forever\ndisrupting the motility and\nmorphology of your sperm.\nI did not say that.\nWhat I said is that if\nyou use cannabis once,\nthen the sperm that are\ngenerated in the 60 days\nafter that cannabis\nuse are going\nto have a higher incidence of\ndisrupted motility and perhaps\nmorphology as well.\nRemember, sperm are continually\ngenerated every 60 days or so.\nAnd so if you use cannabis\nonce, you are not forever\ndisrupting your sperm.\nBut if you are using\ncannabis and then you\nare looking to conceive\nin the next 60 days,\nyou are going to be reducing,\nwe think significantly so,\nthe number of quality\nforwardly motile sperm.\nSo the simple takeaway from\nthis is avoid cannabis use.\nAlthough if you are going\nto use cannabis-- and again,\nthere are medical\nuses of cannabis\nand beneficial uses of cannabis\nfor certain populations.\nIt can be bad for\nother populations.\nWe talked about that in\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nall about cannabis.\nBut if you're going\nto use cannabis,\nyou should try and abstain\nfrom cannabis in the two months\nprior to the attempt to\nfertilize and get pregnant.\nNow, I'm not aware\nof any data on how\ncannabis use by the woman\ncan influence the likelihood\nof fertilization and pregnancy.\nAnd I want to couch this whole\ndiscussion around cannabis\nunder the umbrella of something\nthat came up in the episode\nthat I did on cannabis,\nwhich is that, for about half\nof people out there,\nmale and female--\nso here we're not distinguishing\nby biological sex.\nAbout half of people\nthat use cannabis\nreport it as an aphrodisiac.\nIt makes them want to have\nsexual intercourse more than\nif they don't use cannabis.\nAnd for the other\nhalf, it actually\nhas the opposite effect by way\nof an influence on a hormone\ncalled prolactin,\nwhich suppresses\nthe dopamine system,\nthe testosterone,\nand the estrogenic system.\nAnd so this whole idea that\ncannabis is an aphrodisiac\nseems to be true for about half\nof the human population and not\nfor the other half of\nthe human population.\nSo I mention that because\nI know a number of people\nuse cannabis as an aphrodisiac.\nThey like to use cannabis\nbefore intercourse.\nIt was actually very\nsurprising to me\nto discover when I\nresearched that cannabis\nepisode that approximately\n15% of women who are pregnant\ncontinue to use cannabis\nduring pregnancy.\nAnd that's a very\nalarming statistic.\nAnd everything we know is\nthat the use of cannabis\nduring pregnancy is detrimental\nto the health and particularly\nthe brain development\nof the fetus.\nSo that's a real concern.\nI highly recommend women\nabstain from cannabis use\nduring pregnancy.\nTalk to your OB/GYN about\nit if you're using it all\nor considering using at all.\nSo based on what I told\nyou earlier about the fact\nthat cannabis use is not good\nfor egg quality and the fact\nthat cannabis use can\ndisrupt the motility of sperm\nand therefore is not\ngood for sperm quality\nand it can disrupt the patterns\nof swimming in sperm in ways\nthat reduce the\nlikelihood of fertility,\nI think the take-home message\nis clear, which is that\nwhether or not you want\nto be a cannabis user\nor not, if you are going\nto try and conceive\nand certainly while\nyou're pregnant,\nyou're going to want to\navoid the use of cannabis.\nAnd that is smoked cannabis\nand vaped cannabis.\nAnd during pregnancy,\nthe consumption\nof cannabis even in edible\nform or in tincture form\nis also going to be detrimental\nto the developing fetus.\nBut of course, we\nstarted this conversation\nin the context of body\nposition, in particular\nat the point of\nejaculation, in determining\nthe sex of the offspring and/or\nthe likelihood of getting\na successful fertilization\nin pregnancy.\nAnd I think that given that the\ntilting back of the pelvis--\nso again, this is elevating the\npelvis by about 20 degrees--\nI don't think it has\nto be exact, exact--\nbut about 20 degrees for about\n15 minutes post-ejaculation\ninside of the\nwoman-- or I suppose\nif people are using IUI,\nintrauterine insemination.\nSince that seems to be the\nconsensus among those experts\nthat believe that\npelvic tilt backward\ncan be beneficial for\nincreasing the probability\nof fertilization and\ngiven that it involves\nno cost but a little bit\nof time seems to me that,\nif you want to get\npregnant, that that\nwould be the right thing to do.\nAnd as far as I know,\nthere's no information\nnor was I able to obtain any\nrecommendations from experts\nabout what the ideal\nbody position of the male\nis after ejaculation\nif the goal is\nto increase the probability\nof fertilization in pregnancy.\nSo we've been talking about\nbehavioral interventions,\nsome dos and some don'ts that\npeople can do to increase\ntheir fertility, and the\nlikelihood that any fertilized\negg will be carried\nto term successfully.\nAnd soon we'll also\ntalk about things\nthat people can take to\nimprove their fertility.\nNow, keep in mind that\nthis entire discussion\nis about fertility.\nBut also remember,\nas we discussed\nat the beginning of\nthe episode, trying\nto increase your fertility\nis one of the best ways\nto think about trying\nto create and maintain\noptimal physical health.\nSo for people that\nare trying to conceive\nand for people who are\nnot trying to conceive,\noptimizing your fertility\nstatus, whether or not\nyou're male or female,\nis one of the best ways\nto target those approaches.\nAnd there are now a lot of\ndata supporting the idea\nthat acupuncture\nof all things can\nbe very beneficial for improving\nboth female and male fertility\nand, should a\nwoman get pregnant,\nfor improving the quality\nof outcomes-- that\nis, the likelihood\nthat there will\nbe a successful pregnancy\nthat is carried to term,\nnot premature, and\nso on and so forth.\nNow, for some of\nyou out there, you\nmight think, oh, of\ncourse, acupuncture,\nacupuncture has been known to\nwork for thousands of years.\nAnd therefore,\nit's not surprising\nthat it would assist with\nfertility and pregnancy.\nFor many of you\nout there, however,\nprobably thinking,\nacupuncture, that\nseems kind of like\nfringe science.\nBut what I can assure\nyou is that there are now\nquite a few clinical\ntrials funded\nby government agencies, like the\nNational Institutes of Health,\nshowing that acupuncture is\na very effective treatment\nfor a number of\ndifferent things,\nincluding fertility\nand pregnancy,\nbut for hormone status,\nfor stress relief,\neven for chronic illnesses\nof different kinds,\nincluding autoimmune illnesses.\nSo this is no longer\nconsidered fringe science.\nIn fact, one of the\nbest laboratories\nin the world working\non this is a laboratory\nout of Harvard Medical School\nrun by a guy named Qiufu Fu.\nQiufu's lab has really been\nexploring in a mechanistic way\nhow the different\nstimulation sites that\nare used in acupuncture--\nso where the needles are\ninserted-- tap into\nneural pathways that\nlink the different\norgans of the body.\nSo for instance, they've\nfound that stimulation\nof a particular site\non the lower limb\ncan reduce inflammation\ndramatically\nthroughout the body by\nway of neural pathways\nthat originate in the\nlower limb and extend\nto areas such as the\nkidney and the pancreas.\nSo all these, quote,\nunquote, \"ancient maps\"\nof the human body as they\nrelate to acupuncture\nare now being parsed at the\nlevel of mechanism, which\nI think is wonderful because\nit not only is showing us\nthat so much of what has\nbeen purported and reported\nin the landscape of\nacupuncture actually\nhas an underlying\nmechanistic basis,\nand with additional mechanistic\nunderstanding, of course,\nalways arrive new\nand better practices.\nThat's the idea, to evolve\nthese fields of acupuncture,\nto evolve the fields of\nmechanistic understanding\nof our biology and health.\nAnd so the issue of whether\nor not acupuncture can assist\nin getting pregnant and in\ncarrying a child to term\nand for that child to\nbe healthy are really\nstarting to emerge\nin a major way.\nAnd rather than go\ninto all those data\nin detail, what I can\ntell you is that there are\nclinical trials and data\nsupporting the fact that\nfemale fertility\nitself can be supported\nby acupuncture through several\nmechanisms, one of which\nis the balancing-- and I realize\nthat's a somewhat tricky term,\nand I'll define it\nbetter in a moment--\nthe balancing of hormones across\nthe ovulatory/menstrual cycle,\nincluding regulating\nlevels of FSH\nso that they're not\ntoo high nor too low\nand restricting the\nFSH to the follicular\nphase of the menstrual cycle,\nas well as using acupuncture\nto improve things\nlike blood flow\nand the health of\nthe ovary itself\nand other aspects of the\nfemale reproductive axis.\nSo acupuncture can operate at\nthe chemical level, impacting\nhormones.\nIt can act at the\nmechanical level,\nimpacting the different tissues\nthrough which the egg has\nto pass and so on and so forth.\nLikewise, on the male\nside, acupuncture\nhas been shown to improve\nsemen volume, quality of sperm,\nsperm motility, et\ncetera, and in large part\nthrough changes in the\nneural pathways that\ninnervate the very tissues and\nvascular input to the scrotum\nand testicles, because,\nas we learned earlier,\ntemperature regulation of\nthe scrotum and testicles\nis so vital for\ngetting healthy sperm\nand increasing sperm quality.\nIn addition, there are good\ndata to support the idea\nthat acupuncture can increase\nlevels of testosterone,\nfree testosterone, and\nthe sorts of hormones that\nare going to support healthy\nhormone production and sperm\nproduction in males.\nAnd this is distinct from\napplying testosterone\nfrom an exogenous source.\nSo when we're talking about\nacupuncture and increasing\nlevels of testosterone, we're\ntalking about increasing levels\nof endogenous testosterone.\nSo those Leydig cells can\nsupport the Sertoli cells,\nand the Sertoli cells can make\nthat androgen-binding protein,\nand you get enhanced\nspermatogenesis.\nYou can find evidence for all\nof these different features,\nboth changes to the\nchemical milieu-- that\nis, the hormones-- and changes\nto the mechanical milieu,\nincluding, for instance,\nimprovement of the pathways\nleading from the seminiferous\ntubules to the epididymis\nto the vas deferens, basically\nclearing out the plumbing so\nthat more quality\nejaculate can be delivered,\nwhich, of course, is going\nto increase the probability\nof fertilization.\nSo when you hear\nthat acupuncture\ncan improve the\nlikelihood of pregnancy,\nthat's an accurate statement for\nwhich there are now increasing\namounts of mechanistic data.\nIf you want to learn more\nabout how acupuncture\ncan be used to contribute\nto improved fertilization\nand pregnancy,\nthere are a number\nof different excellent\nreviews on this,\nboth as it relates to females\nand as it relates to males.\nOne of the best papers\nthat I happen to like\nis one that we'll\nprovide a link to\nin the references entitled\n\"Acupuncture and Herbal\nMedicine for Female Fertility,\nAn Overview of Systematic\nReview,\" so a review of reviews.\nThis was published\nrecently in 2021.\nWe'll provide a link to that.\nAnd there's also going to\nbe a link to a review that\nrelates to acupuncture for\nmale fertility and hormone\naugmentation.\nI should just mention\nbriefly that if you're\ngoing to look at\nscientific papers,\none thing that you'll\nwant to consider\nis also looking at the\nreferences that they reference.\nNow, of course, papers tend to\nreference a ton of references,\nin particular in reviews.\nSo what you'll\nwant to do is look\nfor the references\nthat are showing up\nmost often in the introduction.\nThose references\noften are going to be\nthe most prominent recent\nreviews or the most important\nfindings in recent years.\nThat's not always the case,\nbut that's often the case.\nSo if you read the first couple\nof paragraphs of these papers--\nand these are openly available\nas full text, by the way,\nonline if you go\nto these links--\nyou'll be able to access the\nbest papers, the most relevant\npapers, in the context\nof acupuncture supporting\nfemale and acupuncture\nsupporting male fertility\nand hormone status.\nNow, I'd like to discuss things\nthat both men and women can\ntake in order to\nmaximize their fertility.\nAnd again and again, when\nwe're talking about fertility,\nwe're talking about people\nwho want to conceive and have\nchildren, but also we're\ntalking about a basic measure\nof overall health status.\nSo if you're somebody who does\nnot want to conceive children,\nI still encourage you to\nthink about whether or not\nyou would want to\ndo certain things\nor not do certain\nthings in order\nto maximize your fertility as a\nmeans to maximize your vitality\nand longevity,\nbecause that's really\nwhat maximizing fertility is\nabout for a lot of people.\nThat said, I know\na lot of people\nwould like to conceive\nchildren, perhaps not right away\nbut in the future.\nAnd what I'm about\nto describe are\nsome tools and\ninterventions that is things\nthat one can take in order to\nimprove their hormone status\nbut also, in particular,\nthe quality of their eggs\nand the quality of their sperm\nin the short and long term.\nThe first on the list of things\nthat people can take in order\nto improve egg quality or\nsperm quality is L-carnitine.\nL-carnitine is present\nin various foods,\nin particular in red meats.\nBut again, it's going\nto be very hard to get\nsufficient levels of L-carnitine\nto improve egg quality\nand sperm quality, the\nunless you're going\nto take it in supplement form.\nThe typical recommendation,\nbased on peer-reviewed studies\nthat have shown significant\nimprovements in egg quality--\nthat is chromosomal\narrangements,\nthat is the likelihood of\nfertility-- or pregnancy,\nrather--\nthe likelihood of\nsperm being forward\nfast swimmers as opposed\nto twitchers or immotile\nand having proper morphology--\nall those measures\nhas been demonstrated to\nbe significantly improved\nby the ingestion of L-carnitine.\nHow much L-carnitine?\nWell, that depends on how you're\nobtaining the L-carnitine.\nIf you're obtaining\nit in capsule form,\n1 to 3 grams per day of\ncapsule form L-carnitine\nis what's been suggested to\nimprove egg quality and sperm\nquality.\nNow, 1 to 3 grams per day\ncan be taken all at once\nor spread out throughout\nthe 24-hour cycle.\nIt can be taken with\nor without food.\nIt does not seem to matter.\nAnd when taken for a\nperiod of 30 to 60 days,\nit does seem to\nsignificantly improve\nall the parameters that\nhave been discussed for egg\nquality and sperm quality.\nNow, the mechanism for that\neffect is pretty clear.\nL-carnitine is involved in the\nprocessing of lipids, fats,\nin terms of\nmitochondrial function.\nAnd as we talked about\nbefore, mitochondria\nare vital for the organization\nand action of the spindle that\npulls apart the\nchromosomes, taking\nthat cell within the female\nfrom diploid to haploid,\nwhich is essential.\nYou really want just the 23\nindividual chromosomal strands.\nYou don't want\nchromosomal repeats.\nIt's also involved in the\nactual fusion of the egg\nas it exits the ovary and\nenters the ovulation cycle.\nMitochondria are also important,\nas we talked about before,\nfor the forward motility\nof sperm because\nof the enrichment\nof mitochondria\nin that mid region\njust behind the head.\nThey cause the\nwhipping flagellation\nof the tail, allowing\nfor forward movement,\nas well as other aspects\nof cellular morphology.\nSo it makes a lot of sense as to\nwhy L-carnitine supplementation\nwould be beneficial.\nAgain, it's 1 to 3 grams per\nday over a period of about 30\nto 60 months.\nIf you're hoping to conceive\nin the upcoming months,\nrecommend taking it for at\nleast 30 days prior to that.\nOf course, based on the data\nwe talked about before--\ncumulative probability,\nfecundability,\net cetera-- there's\nno reason to not\ncontinue to try for\npregnancy before taking\nL-carnitine, but L-carnitine is\ngoing to improve egg and sperm\nquality.\nAnd so you might actually\ntake the stance that,\neven if you don't have any\nproblem getting pregnant,\nwouldn't you want to\nmaximize the quality\nof the egg that gets fertilized\nand the quality of the sperm\nthat fertilizes that egg?\nSo that's additional rationale\nfor taking L-carnitine.\nOne important note--\nif you are going\nto take L-carnitine in\noral form, in capsule form,\nit can increase\nsomething called TMAO.\nTMAO can cause stiffening\nof the arteries.\nYou don't want TMAO\nlevels to go too high.\nOne way to offset the\nincreases in TMAO caused\nby oral L-carnitine is\nto take 600 milligrams\nof garlic per day.\nI suppose you could\neat cloves of garlic.\nThat would work just as\nwell because garlic contains\nsomething called\nallicin, which can\noffset the increase in TMAO.\nBut 600 milligram capsules\nof garlic are going to be--\nor garlic extract, rather--\nis going to be the most probably\ncost effective and simplest way\nto do this.\nAnd also, they are going to\ncreate that garlic smell.\nSome people like\nthe smell of garlic.\nSome people don't.\nSo if you're going to\ntake oral L-carnitine,\nI suggest also\ntaking 600 milligrams\na day of garlic extract.\nAnd you can do that at any\ntime throughout the day.\nIt doesn't have to be\nwith the L-carnitine.\nThe next item on the list of\ncompounds that have been shown\nto improve egg quality\nand sperm quality--\nand quite robustly so--\nis coenzyme Q10.\nCoenzyme Q10 is something\nthat you can actually measure\nlevels of in your blood.\nMost physicians\nwill say that they\nwant to see your\nlevels of coenzyme Q10\nto be somewhere\nbetween 0.5 and 2.5.\nIt's going to\ndepend on the units.\nMost people, I\nrealize, are not going\nto run off and get\ntheir CoQ10 measured.\nIt's not included in most\nstandard blood tests.\nBut if you were to\nmeasure your CoQ10,\nthat's the range that\nyou want to look for.\nThat said, many people opt\nto supplement with CoQ10.\nAnd you'll find that many\nfertility docs, OB/GYNs,\nand urologists that are trying\nto assist their male patients\nwith fertility\nwill suggest CoQ10\nbecause, again, it supports\nthe health of mitochondria.\nMitochondria are so vital to so\nmany aspects of the formation\nand fertilization of\nthe egg and sperm that,\nof course, fertilizes the egg.\nThe coenzyme Q10 dosages\nthat are most often suggested\nand that you'll observe in\nthe peer-reviewed research\nliterature-- on\nhumans, I should add--\nis 100 to 400\nmilligrams per day.\nAnd the coenzyme Q10\nis taken generally\nwith a meal and ideally\na meal that contains fat.\nAnd there's even some idea\nthat taking coenzyme Q10\nwith your dinner, assuming that\ndinner includes some fat-- you\ndon't have to add\nadditional fat--\nis going to be more advantageous\nthan taking coenzyme Q10 early\nin the day, although\nthat's probably\na detail that's getting a little\ntoo far down in the weeds.\nSo again, 100 to 400 milligrams\nof coenzyme Q10 per day,\nwhether or not you're\na man or a woman,\nfor improving the\nlikelihood of fertility\nby way of improving\negg and sperm quality.\nAnd again, if you're somebody\nwho just doesn't have\nany problem getting pregnant\nor if you're already producing\nmany sperm of\nquality morphology,\nthis is another case in which\nyou could take a step back\nand say, well, why wouldn't\nI want to further optimize\nthe quality of the\negg and the sperm,\nbecause the quality of\nthe egg and the sperm\nultimately are\ngoing to determine\nnot just whether or not you\nhave a successful pregnancy\nbut are going to determine,\nadmittedly in ways that will\nforever remain cryptic\nto you-- but nonetheless\nare going to be\nimportant in determining\nthe qualities of the\nbrain tissue and body\ntissue of your offspring.\nThe third item on the list of\ncompounds which are commonly\nsuggested or prescribed\nby fertility docs\nnowadays for men\nand women wishing\nto conceive and/or\noptimize their fertility\nas a basis for general vitality\nand health is inositol.\nNow, inositol has many uses.\nSo you'll hear about\nthe use of inositol\nfor reducing anxiety\nor improving mood\nor even for the\ntreatment of depression.\nWe talked about inositol\nin previous episodes\nof this podcast.\nFor instance, I\ntalked about inositol\nand in particular taking 900\nmilligrams of myo-inositol\nprior to sleep, which\nis something that I do,\nalong with the other supplements\nthat I take and recommend\nfor sleep, such as magnesium 3\nand 8, apigenin, and theanine.\nIf you're curious\nabout those, you\ncan see our newsletter on sleep\nor our \"Perfect Your Sleep\"\nepisode or the \"Master\nYour Sleep\" episode.\nIt talks about behavioral and\nsupplementation-based tools\nfor improving sleep.\nBut myo-inositol is not just\nsuggested for or prescribed\nfor people that are\nwishing to get pregnant\nand for general health.\nBut myo-inositol is\noften recommended\nfor people that want to improve\negg and sperm quality because\nof the way that\nit can positively\nimpact insulin sensitivity.\nInsulin sensitivity might sound\nlike a bad thing to people\nout there.\nBut it turns out that you\nwant to be insulin sensitive.\nThe last thing you want is\nto be insulin insensitive.\nInsulin insensitivity is\nassociated with type 2\ndiabetes, with obesity,\nand even for people\nwho are not challenged\nwith obesity,\nyou want your cells to\nbe insulin sensitive.\nYou don't want a lot of insulin\nfloating around in your system\nwith your cells unable\nto use that insulin.\nThat's really what insulin\ninsensitivity is about.\nMyo-inositol, at dosages\nof 1 to 5 grams per day--\nthat's pretty high,\n1 to 5 grams per day,\nkeeping in mind that 1,000\nmilligrams is 1 gram--\nhas been suggested to improve\negg quality and sperm quality.\nNow, one point of--\nI wouldn't say\ncaution-- but of note\nis that myo-inositol\ncan reduce anxiety,\nand it can be a\nslight sedative, which\nis why some folks, including\nmyself, take almost a gram, 900\nmilligrams, prior to sleep.\nIf you're going to take\n5 grams of myo-inositol,\nyou would want to restrict\nthat to the late evening\nor second half of your day.\nAnd I don't suggest\nstarting that high.\nI would start with 1\nor 2 grams and then\nworking your way\nup, seeing what you\ncan tolerate in terms of\nthe level of anti-anxiety\nand drowsiness that it produces.\n1 to 5 grams per\nday of myo-inositol\nis what's suggested for both\nmen and women wishing to improve\negg health and sperm health.\nBut for women, it's also often\nsuggested to include also--\nso to take myo-inositol, but\nto also take D-chiro inositol.\nD-chiro inositol\nhas elements in it\nthat can be both pro\nand anti-androgenic.\nAndrogens are things like\ntestosterone and related\nmolecules.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent causes of infertility\nand disruption to egg\nquality, age being the most\nsignificant factor.\nBut another significant\nand very common\nfactor, even among young\nwomen who are of fertile age,\nis having too many androgens\nand as it relates to something\ncalled polycystic\novarian syndrome.\nWe'll do an entire episode\nabout menopause and PCOS\nand a number of\nother things that\nrelate to fertility because\nit's an entire and very\ninteresting other discussion\nthat we need to have.\nBut the recommendation\nis that women\ntake 1 to 5 grams\nof myo-inositol\nbut also D-chiro inositol\nbecause of the ways\nthat it can balance\nandrogens and offset some\nof the negative effects of\npolycystic ovarian syndrome\nor even for women who do\nnot have polycystic ovarian\nsyndrome because of the ways\nthat D-chiro inositol can\nbalance androgens in\nways that are beneficial.\nThe dosages of D-chiro\ninositol that are recommended\ntend to be 1/25 to 1/40\nof the myo-inositol dose.\nSo you'll have to get\nout your calculator.\nRemember, 1,000\nmilligrams equals 1 gram.\nSo figure out, if you're\ntaking 1 gram of myo-inositol\nper day or 2 grams,\nyou're going to want\nto convert that to milligrams.\nSo let's say you're taking 2\ngrams of myo-inositol per day.\nThat's 2,000 milligrams.\nThen you'd want to\ndivide that by 25.\nAnd that's how many\nmilligrams of D-chiro inositol\nyou would want to take, as well.\nOr you could go with the lower\nend dose and divide it by 40\nand take that number of\nmilligrams of D-chiro inositol\nalong with the inositol.\nAgain, probably taking it later\nin the day is going to be good.\nAnd it's not clear\nat all that taking it\nwith food or without food makes\nany difference whatsoever.\nSo I would suggest\nyou do either.\nKeep in mind, as I'm discussing\nthese recommendations,\nI may call them prescriptions.\nBut none of these are\nprescription drugs.\nAnd of course, you should\nalways discuss any supplements\nthat you're planning to take or\nstop taking, for that matter,\nwith your physician.\nI don't say that to protect me.\nI say that to protect you.\nAny time you're going\nto add or change\nsomething in your\noverall health regimen,\nyou want to discuss that\nwith your trusted health care\nprofessional, typically, I would\nhope, a board-certified MD.\nThe fourth item in the list of\ncommonly suggested supplements\nfor men and women wishing to\noptimize egg and sperm quality,\nrespectively, is\nomega-3 fatty acids.\nAnd now, here, we're\ntalking about something\nthat could be obtained from food\nand can be obtained from food.\nSo if you're consuming\nfatty ocean fish, things\nlike sardines, anchovies,\nsalmon with the skin,\nchances are you're going to\nget some quality omega-3s.\nOmega-3s are also available\nin plant-based sources.\nIt's also available in\nkrill, for that matter.\nBut most people find\nit difficult to reach\nthe threshold required\nfor optimizing\nmental health and\nphysical health\nthat is the threshold of the\nEPA essential fatty acids.\nAnd so for that\nmatter, I've suggested\nbefore on this podcast--\nand many fertility\ndocs will suggest--\nthat their patients take omega-3\nfatty acids in supplement form.\nIt could be taken in liquid\nform or in capsule form,\nbut enough of those that you're\ngetting at least 1 gram per day\nof the EPA form of omega-3,\nso at least 1 gram per day\nand as high as 2 or even 3\ngrams per day of the EPA form.\nSo you'll need to\nlook at the packaging\nbecause oftentimes it'll\nsay high potency omega-3.\nIt'll say 1,500\nmilligrams of omega-3s.\nBut that's not 1,500\nmilligrams of the EPA form.\nYou look on the back of\nthe label, and it'll say,\neach serving contains\n750 milligrams of EPA.\nYou want to get above\nthat 1 gram dosage per day\nand as high as 3 grams\nper day of the EPAs.\nThe most cost-effective\nway to do\nthat is going to be\nliquid-form omegas,\nbut that's a little bit\ninconvenient for many people,\nand some people\ndon't like the taste.\nThat's why they rely on\nthe capsule-form omegas.\nAnd of course,\nthere are compounds\nthat can impact\nfertility status, quality\nof eggs, quality of sperm,\nnot by adjusting mitochondria\nor insulin sensitivity\nor creating\na general milieu of support\nfor the egg and the sperm\nproduction and function, such\nas the compounds that I just\nlisted off do, but\nrather compounds\nthat influence the\nhormones involved\nin the generation of sperm and\nthe generation of the eggs,\ninvolved in the ovulatory cycle\nand the spermatogenesis cycle,\nthat is.\nNow, these are going to\ncome in different forms.\nAnd I want to just emphasize\nthat the supplements that\ndo this, that adjust\nhormones in these ways that\ncan be beneficial, are\ndistinct from hormone therapy\nor bioidentical hormones,\ndistinct from hormone therapy\nor bioidentical\nhormones, because,\nas we discussed\nearlier, when you take\na hormone like testosterone or\neven estrogen, for that matter,\nfrom an exogenous,\nan outside source,\nyou're going to disrupt\nthe feedback pathways\ninside of your body, and\nyou're going to shut down\nyour own endogenous production.\nThe supplements I'm about\nto describe do not do that\nand yet can adjust levels of\nhormones in more subtle ways\nthat can be beneficial for the\nprocess of maximizing fertility\nfor males and for females.\nThe first of which on this\nlist that I'd like to discuss\nhas been discussed\nin previous podcasts\nas well, which is a\nsubstance called tongkat ali.\nTongkat ali also\ngoes by other names.\nBut when taken at 400\nmilligrams per day,\nsometimes separated\ninto two dosages\nbut typically taken as\nonce a day early in the day\nbecause they can be a little\nbit stimulating, although not\nanxiety provoking--\nI've never heard of that.\nIt can be a little\nbit stimulating.\nBut 400 milligrams\na day of tongkat ali\nhas been shown to\nincrease free testosterone\nby way of reducing something\ncalled sex hormone binding\nglobulin.\nIt's also been shown to\nincrease luteinizing hormone,\nthe net effect of which\nhas been described\nas a subtle but significant\nincrease in libido\nand some of the other parameters\nassociated with increased\nandrogens, like free\ntestosterone in males\nand females.\nSo a number of people out\nthere are taking tongkat ali\nin this way--\n400 milligrams per\nday, restricted\nto the early part of the\nday, with or without food.\nPeople always ask, do you\nneed to cycle tongkat ali?\nI'm not aware of any need\nto cycle tongkat ali.\nIn fact, it tends\nto work better,\nmeaning the effects on libido\nand some other hormone profiles\ntend to increase over time.\nAgain, tongkat ali is an option.\nCertainly, none of these\nthings are requirements.\nWe're simply\nlisting off options.\nBut many people, both\nmales and females,\nseem to benefit from\nand like tongkat ali,\neven if they're not\nseeking to conceive.\nThere's no reason to think\nthat tongkat ali directly\nimproves sperm quality.\nExcept in males, the increase in\nandrogen created by tongkat ali\nsupplementation can indeed lead\nto improved spermatogenesis.\nSo there's a growing amount\nof data in the research\nliterature on tongkat ali.\nMany people find it beneficial.\nAnd so it's something that\nboth men and women wishing\nto conceive and/or optimize\ntheir fertility just\nas a general health parameter\nmight want to explore.\nThe other supplement that's\nbeen shown to improve both egg\nquality and sperm quality--\nand there I'm\nreferring to a number\nof different parameters related\nto egg quality and sperm\nquality--\nas well as to increase\nlibido fairly substantially\nis a substance called Shilajit.\nShilajit, spelled\nS-H-I-L-A-G-I-T--\nShilajit is actually\na compound that's\nused in ayurvedic\nmedicine, but there\nare some really good\nresearch studies exploring\nthe supplementation with\nShilajit at about 250\nmilligrams twice per day.\nAnd this has been looked\nat in males and in females.\nAnd it does seem to\nsignificantly increase\ntwo hormones.\nOne is testosterone,\nand the other\nis follicle-stimulating hormone.\nAnd for that reason, Shilajit\nis often considered a tonic\nthat people use both as an\naphrodisiac to increase libido\nas well as to\nincrease fertility.\nNow, one note of caution,\nif you're a woman\nand you're considering\ntaking Shilajit in order\nto increase testosterone and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nkeep in mind that\nthe ovulatory cycle\nis this very tightly\nregulated cycle in which you\nwant low but elevated levels\nof follicle-stimulating hormone\nearly in the\nfollicular phase, then\nit peaks right before\novulation, and then low levels\nof follicle-stimulating\nhormone in the second half\nof your cycle.\nFor that reason, using\nShilajit chronically\naround the entire course\nof your ovulatory cycle\ncould be a little\nbit risky, and I'd\nrecommend that you talk to\nyour OB/GYN prior to doing that\nor if doing that at all.\nFor males, it's a little\nbit less of an issue,\nbecause, as I mentioned\nearlier, sperm are constantly\nbeing generated, and\nthe presence of FSH\nis going to increase\nspermatogenesis.\nNow, Shilajit is not FSH itself.\nShilajit stimulates\nthe release of FSH.\nAnd it stimulates the\nrelease of testosterone.\nSo again, there's\nno reason to think\nthat it would shut down your\nendogenous testosterone or FSH\nproduction.\nAlthough there are limited\namount of data that really\nexplore that in detail.\nMany people use\nShilajit in order\nto increase their\ntestosterone, FSH,\ntheir libido, and various\naspects of sperm health.\nAgain, the dosages of Shilajit\nare about 250 milligrams,\ntwo times per day.\nOne issue with\nShilajit is it often\ncomes as a tar, which is a\nlittle hard to measure out\nthe dosages.\nYes, a tar.\nIt's this kind of\nthick, gummy substance\nthat you're supposed\nto dissolve in water.\nAnd the recommendations\nare you take a little bead\nand dissolve it in water.\nIt is available in\ncapsule form where\nthe ability to\ncontrol the dosage\nis made a little bit easier.\nBut of course, as\nwith any supplement,\nI recommend starting with\nthe lowest possible dosage.\nSo you might want to start with\na very small bead of Shilajit\ndissolved in water,\ntaken once per day,\nand then increase\nthe dosage as needed\nin order to obtain the\neffects that you want.\nThings like Shilajit\nstart to bring us\ninto the realm of\nwhat can only be\ndescribed as a little\nbit unwieldy, right?\nHere we're saying you can't\nreally control the dosage.\nNow you're talking\nabout hormones\nthat need to be tightly\nregulated, at least for females\nacross the ovarian cycle.\nFor males, yes,\nit has been shown\nto increase\ntestosterone and FSH,\nimprove sperm motility and sperm\ncount pretty significantly.\nNo reason to think that you\ncouldn't do that chronically\nwith Shilajit.\nAnd yet, I do want to\nacknowledge that Shilajit,\nas this black tar\nsubstance, contains\na lot of different things.\nIn fact, it comes\nfrom a mineral pitch.\nWhat is that?\nIt comes from literally\nthe dirt and plants\nthat have been compressed\nby rocks in the Himalayas.\nSo that's pretty esoteric\nstuff when it really\ncomes down to it.\nBut the biological\neffects of Shilajit,\nin both males and females,\nseem to be related to the fact\nthat it is highly enriched in\nsomething called folic acid,\nand folic acid is\ninvolved in a lot\nof different cellular processes,\nnot the least of which,\nat least in this context, is\nthe transport of molecules\nacross cell membranes.\nAnd for hormones to\nhave their effect,\nthey need to cross cell\nmembranes on the outside\nand the inside of the cell.\nSo maybe that's how\nit's having its effect.\nAgain, the mechanisms of\nexactly how Shilajit increases\ntestosterone and FSH and\nthereby libido, egg quality,\nand sperm quality\naren't entirely clear.\nBut for the more\nadventurous of you out there\nwho want to experiment\nwith Shilajit,\nwhether or not you're\ntrying to conceive or not,\nit might be something\nto consider.\nBut of course, do talk\nto your physician.\nThe next compound that I\nwant to discuss is zinc.\nAnd this discussion\nmainly pertains to males,\nalthough I, of course,\nshould point out\nthat females should get the\nrecommended daily allowance\nof zinc each day.\nMales, on the other\nhand, seem to benefit\nfrom having additionally\nhigh levels of zinc intake.\nNow, that can be\nobtained through foods.\nYou often hear, oh, oysters\nare enriched in zinc,\nand oysters are an aphrodisiac.\nI don't know who's doing\nthe marketing for oysters,\nbut it's really terrific.\nI think that seems\nto have persisted.\nAnd maybe it's true.\nOysters are enriched in zinc.\nWhat does zinc do for fertility?\nWell, in males, we know,\nbased on a really nice set\nof studies, that\nzinc dosages that\nare pretty high of\nabout 120 milligrams\ntaken twice per day--\nthat's quite a lot-- with\nmeals can significantly\nincrease testosterone\nand dihydrotestosterone.\nAnd this probably shouldn't\ncome as a surprise to us.\nIt turns out that zinc is\nhighly enriched in human testes\nand in the testes\nof other animals,\nincluding fish\nand other mammals.\nAnd it was actually in 1921\nthat it was observed in fish\nthat zinc levels skyrocket\nin the testes of fish\nduring their breeding season.\nSo zinc is correlated with\nincreases in breeding,\nbut you never know\nwhich direction\nthat correlation is running.\nIt turns out that\nzinc in both animals,\nincluding fish, other mammals,\nand in humans, strongly\nimpacts the enzymatic\nfunctions in the testes,\nincluding the function of\nandrogen-binding protein.\nSo it seems that\nhigh levels of zinc\ncan increase spermatogenesis\nand testosterone\nlevels very significantly.\nThis was explored in\na really nice study\nthat I'll provide\na reference to.\nIt's an older study.\nBut I really like.\nIt's called \"Effect\nof Zinc Administration\non Plasma Testosterone,\nDihydrotestosterone,\nand Sperm Count.\"\nThis is but just one\nstudy among many now.\nThis dates back to 1981,\nbut there have been studies\nsubsequently that point to\nthe fact that supplementation\nwith zinc at those\nhigh levels can really\nbe helpful in\nterms of increasing\nsperm count,\ntestosterone, and even\ntesticular size, of all things.\nSo one important\npoint about taking\nzinc-- this 120 milligrams\nof zinc two times daily\ndefinitely needs to\nbe done with meals.\nIf you've ever taken\nzinc on an empty stomach,\neven if you just take 15\nor 30 milligrams of zinc,\nyou can feel very nauseous,\nnot well, for a few hours.\nSo make sure that you're\ntaking zinc with full meals.\nSo this would mean that\nyou're taking in at least\ntwo full meals per day.\nI should also mention that\nzinc supplementation did not\nappear to impact\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone\nor prolactin.\nSo it seems to be a\nfairly targeted effect\non the testosterone and\nrelated pathways in males.\nAs far as I know, there have\nnot been systematic explorations\nof the effects of high levels of\nzinc administration on females.\nI would hope that those\nstudies would soon be done.\nBut meanwhile, if\nyou're a male and you're\ninterested in\nimproving sperm quality\nand your testosterone levels\noverall for whatever reason,\nzinc likely is a good candidate.\nAnd that pretty much\nsummarizes the compounds\nthat men and women\nshould take in order\nto maximize egg quality,\nsperm quality, and fertility.\nAnd then, of course,\nwe start to enter\nthe landscape of other things\nthat men and women can take\nin order to improve fertility,\nand those other things\ngenerally are\nprescription drugs.\nAnd so I just want to mention\nwhat a few of those are.\nBut of course, these are things\nthat you would absolutely\nhave to obtain prescriptions\nfor from your MD,\nand your MD, without\nquestion, would\nwant to take blood tests prior\nto prescribing these things.\nSo for instance,\nif men have been\ntaking exogenous\ntestosterone through the use\nof anabolic steroids, like\nperformance-enhancing drugs\nor even testosterone\nreplacement therapy,\ntheir endogenous\ntestosterone levels\nare going to be very low,\nand their sperm counts\nare going to be very low,\nunless, for instance, they\nare prescribed and\ntaking something\nlike hCG, human chorionic\ngonadotropin, which\nmimics LH and would stimulate\nthe testes to produce\ntestosterone and through\nsome indirect pathways rescue\nspermatogenesis, although\nnot to the same degree\nas if people are not\ntaking exogenous sources\nof testosterone.\nSome men, even if they've\nnever touched TRT or exogenous\ntestosterone of any\nkind, will be prescribed\nto take hCG because\nof its ability\nto stimulate the\ntestes to produce\nmore testosterone and sperm.\nSo they're just\ntaking hCG alone.\nOther men will take--\nor will be prescribed, rather--\nFSH in order to stimulate\nspermatogenesis, or hCG\nand FSH, or clomiphene,\nwhich can regulate\nall sorts of things in\nthe both testosterone and\nestrogen-related pathways at\nthe level of brain and pituitary\nand gonad, testes.\nLikewise, for women,\nif they're low in FSH,\nthey might be prescribed FSH.\nIf they are low in\nluteinizing hormone,\nthey might be prescribed hCG.\nIf they're low in\ntestosterone, they might even\nbe prescribed testosterone.\nAnd if their\ntestosterone is too high\nand they're dealing\nwith PCOS, they\nmight be prescribed\nanti-androgens and androgen\nblockers and on and on and on.\nThere are so many\ndifferent hormones that\ncan impact the different\naspects of the ovulatory\nand the spermatogenesis\ncycle that the OB/GYNs\nand the urologists focused on\nmale fertility nowadays really\nhave an excellent handle\non which levers and buttons\nand threads to pull and\npush and so forth in order\nto set in motion\na proper ovulatory\ncycle and a proper\nspermatogenesis cycle.\nEverything we talked\nabout up until now\nand in the early\nphase of this episode,\nespecially, about how\nthe brain commands\nthe pituitary and the pituitary\ncommands the gonads and then\nthe gonads, the\novary, or the testes\nsend feedback signals\nto the pituitary\nto then influence\nthe pituitary, all\nof that incredible\norchestra, that dance,\nis so tightly regulated in\na way that really provides\nthe OB/GYNs and\nthe fertility docs\nconcerned with male fertility\nexceptional tools to,\nfor instance, figure out if a\nman is not producing any sperm\nbut his testosterone levels\nare well within normal range,\nwell, then there are some very\nclear sets of explorations\nand potential treatments.\nSome of which are\nmechanical, making sure\nthe epididymis and vas\ndeferens are clear,\nallowing the sperm to\nenter the ejaculate\nand the ejaculate\nto enter the urethra\nand obviously to enter\nthe female, as well\nas for a woman\nwho's not ovulating\nto adjust her levels of FSH or\nmaybe even to apply acupuncture\nin conjunction with\nsupplementation\nand various prescription\nhormone therapies to adjust\nfertility and ovulation\nand the probability\nof successful pregnancy.\nSo there's a vast landscape\nof prescription drugs\nand surgical interventions\nof varying degrees\nof invasiveness.\nAnd some are, for instance,\noutpatient procedures.\nSome require general\nanesthesia, et cetera,\nin order to maximize male\nand female fertility.\nWhat I've tried to do\ntoday is to provide you\nwith a deep dive understanding\nof the ovulatory and menstrual\ncycle.\nWe talked about the brain,\nthe pituitary, the ovary,\nthe Fallopian\ntubes, and, in fact,\nthe whole female\nreproductive axis\nas it relates to\nfertility and reproduction\nI also describe the male\nreproductive axis as it relates\nto the brain, the pituitary,\nthe gonad, the testes,\nand the various\nducts, the pathways,\nout of the testes that allow\nthe sperm to be enriched\nwithin the semen and then\nthe semen and the ejaculate\nto exit through the urethra.\nI did all that as a way\nto frame the various tools\nand interventions\nthat can really\nassist in increasing fertility,\negg quality, and sperm quality.\nSo when we discuss\nmitochondria in the context\nof the development of an egg\nor the development of sperm\nand its ability to\nswim quickly forward,\nnow it should make\nsense as to why\ngive an intervention,\nwhether or not\nit's L-carnitine\nor whether or not\nit's exercise or whether or\nnot it's getting enough sleep\nand limiting stress, why all\nthat should matter and why,\nin fact, mechanistically\nthose interventions can work.\nBecause, indeed, there\nare many interventions\nthat we can all do and use\nto support our fertility.\nAnd again, as a more\ngeneral theme today,\nI really wanted to,\nA, teach you about\nthe human reproductive axis--\nI do find the biology of the\novulatory and menstrual cycle\nand spermatogenesis to be\nabsolutely fascinating to me.\nAnd again, if you're somebody\nwho's interested in conceiving\nor if you've already\nconceived children\nand even if you don't\nwant more children,\nthis is really the\naspect of our biology\nthat allowed us to be here.\nIt's the aspect of our biology\nthat determined whether or not\nwe are male or female.\nIt's the aspect of our biology\nthat determines so, so much,\nand yet I think that most\nof us generally are not\ntaught this in school or\nat least not at the depth\nthat we discussed it today.\nSo hopefully that information\nwas in and of itself\ninteresting and\nperhaps useful as well.\nAnd I do think that\neven if people are not\nwishing to conceive more\nchildren that the information\nrelated to fertility and\noptimizing egg and sperm health\nis of value in the sense that\noptimizing egg and sperm health\ncan be used as a proxy for\noptimizing our body and brain\nhealth generally.\nIn other words-- and here I'm\nadmittedly taking words out\nof the mouths of the\nvarious wonderful doctors,\nthe OB/GYNs and neurologists\nthat helped inform me\nin anticipation of this\nepisode-- what is good\nfor the woman is\ngood for the egg\nand for fertility\nand for pregnancy.\nAnd what's good for the\nman is good for the quality\nand production of sperm and\nfor fertility and pregnancy.\nPut differently, whether or\nnot we are male or female,\nthe things that we can do\nto optimize our fertility\nare the exact same\nthings that we should all\nbe doing to optimize our\nvitality and our longevity.\nAnd I realize today's episode\nwas so much the deep dive\nand fairly broad, as well,\nthat it ended up being\nfairly long and extensive.\nAnd yet we still\nhave not touched\non any of the important themes\nthat I know a number of people\nwant to know about-- so,\nfor instance, menopause,\nandropause, PCOS,\nand other themes\nrelated to hormones and\nreproductive function\nand biology.\nAnd I promise that we will have\nepisodes, both solo episodes\nand episodes with expert\nguests, in the future\nto cover all of those\ntopics in detail.\nMeanwhile, the information\ndiscussed in today's episode\nshould serve as a\nbasic foundation\nfor those discussions\ngoing forward\nand hopefully were of interest\nto you in their own right.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to\nour
