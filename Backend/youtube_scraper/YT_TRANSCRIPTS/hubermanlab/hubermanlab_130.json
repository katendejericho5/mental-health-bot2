    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab Guest Series,\nwhere I and an\nexpert guest discuss\nscience and science-based\ntools for everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's episode marks\nthe first in a series\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nDr. Andy Galpin is a professor\nof kinesiology at Cal State\nUniversity Fullerton and\none of the foremost world\nexperts on the science\nand application of methods\nto increase strength, speed,\nendurance, hypertrophy,\nand various other aspects of\nfitness, exercise, and sports\nperformance.\nAcross this six episode\nseries, Dr. Andy Galpin\npulls from his expertise\nworking with everything\nfrom professional athletes\nto recreational exercisers\nand teaches us the mechanisms,\nlogic, and specific protocols\nfor how to achieve any of the\nnumber of different exercise\nadaptations that I mentioned\na moment ago, ranging\nfrom strength to\nendurance, hypertrophy,\nand everything in between.\nWe get really far into details,\nbut at all times paying\nattention to the\nmacroscopic issues.\nThat is, how to create\na program for endurance\nor strength or\nhypertrophy or speed,\nor one that combines\nall of those.\nWe also talk about\nsupplementation and nutrition\nand how to maximize recovery\nfor each of the different types\nof exercise adaptations.\nDuring today's\nepisode, Dr. Galpin\nteaches us how to assess\nour level of fitness\nand, more generally, how to\nthink about fitness so that we\ncan best achieve our fitness\nexercise and performance goals.\nDr. Professor Andy Galpin.\nSuper excited to have you here.\nYou're such an\nimmense treasure trove\nof information on physical\ntraining and optimizing\nfor specific goals and outcomes\nwith physical exercise.\nI'm curious, however--\nso many people have\ndifferent levels of fitness.\nSome people are professional\nathletes, of course,\nbut most people are not.\nMany people exercise regularly.\nSome people are trying\nto do that more.\nSome people are doing too much\nof that; they're overtraining,\nthey're not recovering enough.\nIf we were to take a step back\nand each and every one of us\nask how fit are we, with\nthe word fit, of course,\nbeing a very broad\nencompassing word,\ncould encompass endurance,\ncertainly it does,\nstrength, the\nability to run fast,\neven if for short distances, it\nmight even include hypertrophy\nor directed hypertrophy, trying\nto balance one's musculature\nto offset asymmetries, recover\nfrom injuries, et cetera.\nHow should I, or anyone\nelse for that matter\nthink about their\nlevel of fitness?\nI know my resting\nheart rate, but what\ndo I do in terms of really\nassessing whether or not\nI'm as fit as I could be\nand should be both for sake\nof health and performance?\nAnd here I'm asking you the\nquestion not as an athlete,\nbut as somebody\nwho's been pretty\nconsistent as an exerciser.\nBut if we were to throw our\narms around this question of how\ndo we assess our\nfitness, what would\nbe the different\nlevels of assessment\nthat we should\nthink about and do?\nANDY GALPIN: When it\ncomes to exercise,\npeople generally have\ntwo major goals in mind.\nGoal number one is achieving\nsome sort of appearance.\nRight?\nThis is I want to be big,\nor I want to not be too big,\nor I want to be lean.\nSomething, right?\nIt doesn't matter\nwhat that goal is,\nbut there is an aesthetic\ncomponent to almost everybody.\nThey want to look a certain\nway or not look a certain way.\nThe other one is functionality.\nSo I want to be able to\nperform a certain way.\nNow, again, that definition\ndiffers per person.\nSo I want to be\nbetter at strength,\nI want to be better\nat mobility, I\nwant to be able to have energy\nthroughout the day, whatever\nit is.\nSo there's some sort\nof appeal to aesthetic\nand there's some sort of\nappeal to functionality.\nSo within both of\nthose categories,\nwe want to be in a position\nwhere we can understand, where\ndo I need to go with\nmy exercise training\nso that I can be as\nfit and as healthy\nand achieve these\ngoals that I want now,\nas well as be in a position\nwhere I can maintain them\nfor a long period of time.\nSo this blends both\nimmediate goals.\nSo say you're just interested\nin squatting a lot of weights.\nSay you're interested in\nrunning a 5K time the best run.\nIt doesn't matter.\nIt blends that with the desire\nto have a long wellness span,\nto be fit throughout life,\nto achieve all those things\nfor as long as possible.\nSo then the question\nkind of comes back\nto saying, well, how do\nI know which area I need\nto focus on the most, and why\nam I not achieving these goals,\nor how can I get there\nmore effectively.\nAnd if we look at\nthe big picture,\nwe have to understand that there\nare several major components\nto physical fitness that\nare going to be required\nin all of these categories.\nAnd to achieve that, there\nare a handful of components\nthat have to happen to be\nable to hit those goals.\nNow there are infinite methods.\nSo the saying we actually use\nhere a lot is, the methods are\nmany, but the concepts are few.\nSo what I'd love to do\ntoday is, over the course\nof our discussion is hit\nexactly what those concepts are\nand then cover a whole\nbunch of different methods.\nAnd we could do that for hours.\nBut we'll cover a number\nof them for various goals.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\none of the reasons\nI went into neuroscience and\nnot into exercise science is\nbecause of this thing\nneuroplasticity,\nthe nervous system's\nability to adapt.\nBut the more time\nI spend with you\nand the more I learn from you,\nI realize that many, if not all\nof the organ systems of our body\nhave this incredible ability\nto adapt.\nAnd when we're talking\nabout physical exercise,\nthere are incredible\nadaptations that,\nof course, involve\nthe nervous system,\nbut also involve muscle and\nconnective tissue and so\nmany other cell\ntypes and tissues.\nThat said, when we\ntalk about fitness,\nwhat are the major\ntypes of adaptations\nthat underlie this thing\nthat we call fitness?\nAnd later, I know\nwe're going to get\ninto how different\nforms of exercise\ncan trigger different\ntypes of adaptations,\nbut what are the major\nadaptations that one can create\nin their body using exercise?\nANDY GALPIN: There\nare many reasons why\none should exercise,\nand we could perhaps\ncover that later in our chats.\nBut the physiological\nadaptations\ncan be bucketed really\nin a nine areas.\nSo the very first one is what\nI call skill or technique.\nSo just learning to move\nbetter, more efficiently\nwith a specific position\nand timing and sequence,\nor whatever that is.\nThis could be running\nmore effectively,\nthis could be practicing\na skill like shooting\na ball or an implement,\nswinging a golf club.\nAnything like that, I call\nthat skill development.\nThe second one is\nspeed, so this is simply\nmoving at a higher\nvelocity or with a better\nrate of acceleration.\nThat's very similar to the\nnext one, which is power.\nAnd power is speed\nmultiplied by force.\nThe next one then, of\ncourse, on top of that,\nis force or strength.\nSo those are really\nsynonymous terms.\nHow effectively can\nyou move something?\nNow, this is often\nconfused-- strength, rather--\nas muscular endurance.\nSo what I mean by\nthat is strength truly\nis a marker of what's the\nmaximum thing you can move\nor what's the maximum amount of\nforce you can produce one time.\nIt's not how many repetitions\nin a row you can do.\nThat's actually another\none of our adaptations\ncalled muscular endurance.\nSo that is typically under\nthe order of say five to 25,\nmaybe 50 repetitions.\nThink of a classic how many\npush-ups can you do in a row?\nHow many sit-ups can\nyou do in a minute?\nThings like that are\nmuscular endurance.\nMuscular endurance\ntends to be localized,\nso this is specific\nto just, say,\nyour triceps and your deltoids.\nIt's not a overall\ncardiovascular endurance marker\nor anything like that.\nSo that's strength, number four.\nNumber five is\nmuscle hypertrophy.\nAnd this is the\nfirst time now we're\ntalking about an\nappearance rather\nthan a functional outcome.\nSo moving better, moving\nfaster, and moving heavier\nare indicators of how\nwell you can move.\nThis is the first one\nthat's just simply\nhow big is your muscle?\nAnd that's muscle\nhypertrophy or muscle size.\nAfter that is\nmuscular endurance.\nSo this is how many\nrepetitions you can typically\ndo of a movement.\nSo think of how many\npush ups in a row\nyou can do, how many sit\nups in a minute you can do,\nthings that are\ntypically in five\nto 50 repetition sort of range.\nAnd it is often or it is\nalmost always local muscle.\nSo what I mean by\nthat is a push-up test\nis really how many\nreps that your triceps\nand pecs and deltoids can do.\nIt is not a\ncardiovascular endurance.\nIt is not a global\nphysiological endurance.\nIt's specific to, typically,\none or a few muscle\ngroups at a time.\nAnd this is why you have to do\nmultiple tests for every group\nthere.\nAfter that, now we've moved\ninto number seven, which is\nwhat I call anaerobic capacity.\nThis is more synonymous\nwith maximum heart rate.\nAnd now we're actually\nlooking at, rather\nthan a single movement\nor muscle group,\nit is a total\nphysiological limitation.\nSo it is the maximum\namount of work\nyou can do in, say,\n30 to 45 seconds,\nmaybe even up to 120\nseconds, of all-out work.\nThink of your classic\ninterval type of stuff here.\nSo how much work can you\ndo at a maximum rate,\nwhere you're going to\nenter tremendous amounts\nof global fatigue?\nThe next past that is\nmaximal aerobic capacity.\nAnd this is probably\nactually something\nlike in the eight to 15\nminute range, where you're\ngoing to reach probably\nboth a maximum heart rate\nas well as a true\nVO2 max, which we'll\ntalk a lot more about\nwhat that is later.\nSo that is different\nfrom the previous one,\nwhere you can't reach this\nin a matter of seconds.\nIt simply takes multiple\nminutes to get to a position\nto where your VO2\nmax is actually\ngoing to be\nsufficiently challenged\nor an indicator there.\nAnd then the last\none, number nine,\nis what I call long duration.\nAnd this is just your ability\nto sustain submaximum work\nfor a long period of\ntime with no breaks,\nno reduction whatsoever.\nThis is often called steady\nstate training or a lot\nof people just think of\nthis when they think of,\nquote, unquote, \"cardio,\"\nbut your ability\nto continue to move without\nany breaks or change or drop\nis the last and\nfinal adaptation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And for\nlong distance steady state,\nI'm guessing it exceeds\n15 minutes because--\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--the previous one\nwas eight to 15 minutes or so.\nWhat sort of rate ranges are\nwe talking about in terms\nof this long duration?\nANDY GALPIN: Well, that's\nactually wonderful.\nYou're going to be\nanything past 15 minutes.\nSo really, if you look at\na minimal number there,\nit's generally 20 minutes\nof what we're looking for,\nbut a more typical would\nbe 20 to 60 minutes.\nBut anything past\nthat would still\nbe limited by your\nlong-duration endurance,\nso your ability to\nsustain work over time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo given that there are nine\ndifferent major adaptations\nthat can be induced with\nexercise of specific types,\nis there any one global\ntest or assessment\nthat people can take or do\nthat allows them to determine\nwhat level of ability, of\nfitness they have in each\nand every one of these\nnine different categories?\nANDY GALPIN: There are\nprobably dozens or more tests\nthat you can do for each one\nof those nine categories.\nAnd what I would\nactually like to do\nis walk you through\nmy favorites for each\nand giving you both the\nscientific gold standard--\nso if you have the ability,\nunlimited resources, what\nshould you go do?\nAs well as some that\nare equipment-free,\nthat are cost-free, things that\nanyone can do across the world.\nIn addition to that,\nI want to walk you\nthrough what those\nnumbers should be,\nhow do you identify if you're\nreally poor in something\nor if you're great.\nAnd then if you aren't as\ngood, maybe, in a category\nand you want to\nget better at it,\nexactly what to do\nin terms of protocols\nfor how to achieve optimal\nresults in each of those steps.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I noticed\nin your list of the nine\ndifferent adaptations to\nexercise that you did not\nmention fat loss\nor health-promoting\nbenefits, which are two reasons\nthat a lot of people exercise.\nWas there a specific reason\nthat you did not mention those?\nANDY GALPIN: Absolutely.\nIt's because those things are\nactually not specific training\nstyles.\nThey are byproducts\nof these nine.\nSo what I mean by that is if you\nunderstand how fat loss occurs,\nwhich we can\ncertainly talk about,\nyou'll realize some of\nthese nine protocols\nare effective for fat\nloss and some are not.\nGeneral health is\nthe same thing.\nWhen we understand\nwhat it actually\nmeans to be healthy from a\nphysiological perspective,\nthen the rationale\nfor what to train for\nis going to determine itself.\nSo what I mean is,\nlooking at things like,\nin order to be healthy, you have\nto have sufficient strength,\nyou have to have\ncardiovascular fitness,\nand you have to have sufficient\nmuscle and et cetera.\nTherefore, training\nfor one's health\nis determined by\nthose restrictions.\nSo for you, Andrew, you may need\nto do more strength training\nto be healthy, where me,\nbecause I'm strong already,\nway stronger than you, I may\nnot need to do as much strength\ntraining.\nSo our, quote, unquote,\n\"health-based protocols\"\nare based on our current status\nor limitations in physical\nfitness among these nine areas.\nSo what I would\nlike to do today is\nto cover a brief history\nof exercise science.\nAnd the reason is it's going to\nexplain a lot about why people\nare not getting the goals\nin their exercise programs\nthat they want as\nwell as gives you\nvery specific direction\nabout what to do instead.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I can't wait\nto hear all the things that I'm\ndoing incorrectly and to\nhave you help me remedy that.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is also separate from Dr.\nGalpin's teaching and research\nroles at Cal State Fullerton.\nIt is, however, part of\nour desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that\ntheme, we'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Momentous.\nMomentous make supplements of\nthe absolute highest quality.\nThe Huberman Lab\npodcast is proud to be\npartnering with Momentous for\nseveral important reasons.\nFirst of all, as I\nmentioned, their supplements\nare of extremely high quality.\nSecond of all, their\nsupplements are generally\nin single-ingredient\nformulations.\nIf you're going to develop\na supplementation protocol,\nyou're going to want to\nfocus mainly on using\nsingle-ingredient formulations.\nWith single-ingredient\nformulations,\nyou can devise the\nmost logical and\neffective and cost-effective\nsupplementation\nregimen for your goals.\nIn addition,\nMomentous supplements\nship internationally.\nAnd this is, of\ncourse, important\nbecause we realize that many\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\nlisteners reside outside\nthe United States.\nIf you'd like to try the\nvarious supplements mentioned\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nin particular supplements,\nfor hormone health, for sleep\noptimization, for focus,\nas well as a number\nof other things,\nincluding exercise recovery,\nyou can go to livemomentous--\nspelled O-U-S-.\nSo that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an\nelectrolyte drink that\ncontains the exact ratios of the\nelectrolytes sodium, magnesium,\nand potassium to optimize\ncellular functioning\nfor mental and\nphysical performance.\nMost people realize\nthat hydration is key.\nWe need to ingest enough fluids\nin order to feel our best\nand perform our best, but what\nmost people do not realize\nis that the proper functioning\nof our cells, and nerve cells,\nneurons in particular, requires\nthat sodium, magnesium,\nand potassium be present\nin the correct ratios.\nNow, of course, people\nwith prehypertension\nand hypertension need to be\ncareful about their sodium\nintake, but what a lot\nof people don't realize\nis that if you drink\ncaffeine, if you exercise,\nand, in particular,\nif you're following\na very clean diet, that is not\na lot of processed foods, which,\nof course, is a\ngood thing, chances\nare you're not getting\nenough sodium, potassium,\nand magnesium to optimize\nmental and physical performance.\nLMNT contains a\nscience-backed ratio\nof 1,000 milligrams-- that's 1\ngram of sodium, 200 milligrams\nof potassium, and 60 milligrams\nof magnesium, and no sugar.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drink LMNT--\nthat's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto get a free LMNT sample pack.\nWith your purchase.\nAgain, that's\ndrinklmnt.com/huberman to claim\na free sample pack.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers with cooling, heating,\nand sleep-tracking capacity.\nI've been using an Eight\nSleep mattress cover\nfor about the last eight\nmonths, and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI'm sleeping about\nthe same amount,\nbut I'm sleeping far\ndeeper, and I'm now\ngetting the proper ratios\nof so-called rapid eye\nmovement, or REM sleep,\nand slow-wave sleep\nand waking up feeling\nfar more recovered\nmentally and physically.\nThe underlying mechanism for all\nthat is very straightforward.\nI've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nand elsewhere about the critical\nrelationship between sleep\nand body temperature,\nthat is, in order\nto fall asleep at\nnight, your body\nneeds to drop by about one\nto three degrees in terms\nof core body temperature.\nAnd waking up involves\na one to three\ndegree increase in\ncore body temperature.\nWith Eight Sleep\nmattress covers,\nyou can adjust the temperature\nof your sleeping environment\nto be one temperature at\nthe start of the night,\na different temperature in\nthe middle of the night,\nand a different temperature\nas you approach morning,\neach of which can place you\ninto the optimal stages of sleep\nand have you waking up feeling\nmore refreshed than ever.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Eight Sleep,\nyou can go

those\nmistakes, I'm curious as to\nwhether or not you have\nany favorite one or two\nstudies that point to a\nnaturally occurring example\nof how people can become\nvery fit in one area and not\nanother.\nI'm familiar with seeing\nendurance athletes that\napparently have\nterrific endurance\nbut, at least to my eye, don't\nlook like they are particularly\nstrong.\nI'm also familiar with seeing\nindividuals that are very, very\nstrong, particularly\non social media,\nbut that don't look\nlike they could walk up\na flight of stairs,\nmuch less run a mile.\nDo you have any\nexamples of studies\nin or outside the\nlaboratory that point\nto that in a concrete way?\nANDY GALPIN: There's\na lot to discuss here,\nbut I'll answer really clear.\nIf you look across the\nliterature-- and this\nis actually back to as\nearly as the mid 1950s.\nIn fact, it actually goes\nback previous to that,\nto the Harvard Fatigue\nLab, 1927 to 1947 area.\nPeople actually were\nadvocating, at that point,\na combination of strength\ntraining and endurance.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In the 1920s?\nANDY GALPIN: Way back then.\nIn fact, it actually\ngoes prior to that.\nIn the late 1880s, there is\nscientific evidence back then.\nIt became more well-developed\nin the mid 1950s and '60s.\nIn fact, there was\nthe initial stages\nof what's called the Exercise\nAs Medicine Movement, which\nis the movement now, but the\ninitial stages of that actually\nroute back to the 1950s.\nAnd I could actually go\ninto that whole discussion\nand the story of how\nthat all came about,\nbut that's the Health\nIs Wealth mantra\nthat came from the 1950s, from\nthe scientific community then.\nAll those data points\nare going to suggest\nyou need a combination of\nsome sort of broad strength\ntraining and broad endurance.\nNow, if you have a specific\ngoal five months from now,\nyou want to compete in a race\nor hit a certain physique\nthing, that's fine to focus\non one area of training.\nCertainly, if you're an\nathlete, that's different.\nBut if you want\nto maximize health\nand overall functionality\nthroughout time,\nit needs to be a combination.\nAnd to really, really\nhighlight this,\nI can actually talk\nabout a couple of studies\nthat I've done.\nOne of them we actually\ndid in Stockholm, Sweden.\nSo I did this at the Karolinska\nInstitute, which you probably\nare aware of.\nIt's actually one of\nthe founding places\nof all of exercise physiology.\nGenerally, it started there.\nIt was called something\ndifferent back then,\nbut really, our\nentire field came out\nof Stockholm and the\nKarolinska Institute.\nAnd we worked with a whole\nbunch of cross-country skiers\nthat were in their 80s and 90s.\nAnd so they were competitive\nskiers in the 1940s and '50s,\nand they had been\nskiing competitively\nfor that entire duration.\nSo you're talking 50 to 60\nconsecutive years of competing.\nSo these are 80 to 90-year-olds,\nliving alone and healthy.\nAnd we compared them to\na group of individuals\nhere in America who are the same\nage but were not exercising.\nAnd what we wanted\nto do is to see\nand of look at, what are these\nlifelong endurance individuals?\nWhat do they look like?\nAnd when we brought them into\nthe lab, which is, by the way,\namazing, to do a VO2 max\ntest on a 92-year-old,\nespecially in a language\nthat they don't speak,\nyou can imagine, you're\ndoing this in the hospital.\nAnd you're running\npeople through,\nthis is a cycling task.\nAnd so for a VO2 max test,\nyou have a mask on your face,\nyou're hooked up\nto a metabolic cart\nso we can collect\nall the gases that\nare coming out of\nyour mouth, and you're\nchanting these people on.\nAnd basically, every\nminute, the workload\ngets harder and\nharder and harder\nuntil you can't complete it.\nAnd we're doing this\nin a cardiology center,\nand the cardiologists are\nusually waiting for their heart\nrate to get slightly\nelevated and they stop them\nbecause they're\n85, 86 years old.\nAnd not only are we\nnot stopping them,\nbut we are screaming in\ntheir ears, just go, go, go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In\nSwedish or English?\nANDY GALPIN: In English.\nAnd then the translator--\nbut it doesn't\ntake a lot of translation\nwhen someone's screaming\nat your face, go, go, go.\nSo we ran them through a\nwhole bunch of VO2 max tests.\nAnd we did the same\nthing for those folks\nback here in America.\nAnd what was incredibly\nclear from that study\nwas the VO2 max--\nyou can think about\nthese numbers,\nand this is what's\ncalled relative.\nAnd the relative\nterms are milliliters\nper kilogram per minute.\nAnd so a standard\nnumber is about 18,\nis what we call the\nline of independence.\nSo if your VO2 max is below\n18 milliliters per kilogram\nper minute, it's very hard\nfor you to live by yourself.\nSo your fitness is\nso low, you probably\nare going to need to have\nsomebody living with you\nor you'll need to be in some\nsort of assisted living home.\nSo if you are in a VO2\nmax of 20 or 21 or 22,\nyou're not below that\nline of independence,\nbut you're on that threshold.\nAnd so what we found was\nour folks here in America,\nthe group average was\nright around that number.\nSo they were living at\nhome, by definition.\nWe picked them to be\npeople living by themselves\nin their 80s and not\nin a living home,\nbut they didn't\nhave any bandwidth.\nSo if they got a cold or\nthey had anything pop up\nwhere they lost a\nlittle bit of fitness,\nthey were going to\ndrop below that line\nand would probably have to go\nto some sort of assisted living\nsituation.\nThe folks in Stockholm, the\ncross-country skiers, the group\naverage was much closer\nto 35 to 38 milliliters\nper kilogram per minute.\nNow, that number is\nabout the VO2 max\nyou would find for a\nnormal college male.\nAnd so these folks that\nwere literally 80 or 90--\nthe joke, if a sabertooth tiger\nran in the room or whatever\nand it chased it\ndown and we all had\nto run to see who\ndidn't get eaten alive,\nthe college men would\nprobably have gotten\neaten before the 90-year-olds.\nAnd in one case, we had\na 92-year-old individual.\nAnd I think his VO2\nmax was 38, which\nwas, in our estimation,\na world record,\nthe highest VO2 max for\nsomebody over the age of 90.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: May I ask what\nis the typical resting heart\nrate for somebody very\nfit, like these older\nSwedish cross-country skiers?\nIf somebody has-- let's\nsay their number is\n35 millimeters per kilogram\nin this VO2 max test,\nbut since most of\nus don't have access\nto that kind of equipment, but\nwe can measure our pulse rate.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What was\na typical resting heart\nrate, resting pulse rate?\nANDY GALPIN: Sub 60.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Sub 60.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nI mean, typically\nthat's a good number\nto go off of for anybody,\nregardless of age.\nAny time I see\nsomebody above that,\nI'm going to start\nasking questions.\nCertainly above-- you'll see\nin the literature people will\nsay 60 to 80 is normal, and I\ndon't agree with that at all.\nIf your resting heart rate\nis 75 beats per minute,\nthere's either something\ngoing on or you're not fit.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How\nmuch cross-country skiing\nwere they doing, on\naverage, in the previous,\nlet's say, if we\ntake the previous 20\nyears since they'd been\nlongtime cross-country skiers.\nDivide that by 20 years.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nANDREW HUBERMAN: On average,\nare these people cross-country\nskiing five hours a day, two\nhours a day, an hour a day?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, that's\nactually a good question.\nI don't remember.\nIt's been many years,\nbut they were not\ndoing it every single day.\nAnd the volume would\nnot have shocked you.\nIt was the consistency over\n50 years that got them there.\nNow, obviously, these\npeople were, again,\nworld champions and Olympic\ngold medalists in the 1940s\nand '50s, so they were elite.\nThey just continued\nconsistently over time,\nbut it wasn't a shocking\namount of physical fitness.\nThey also didn't go out of\ntheir way to train hard.\nThey were busy chopping wood.\nThey were busy doing a\nnumber of other things.\nAnd then they just happened\nto do some of these races\nand ski along the way, but\nit wasn't a crazy amount too\nwhere you're like,\noh, that's great,\nbut I could never\nhit that number.\nIt was something\nmuch more reasonable.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo is the takeaway\nto be consistent about getting\ncardiovascular exercise?\nAnd we can define what\n\"consistent\" means\nin terms of days per\nweek a little bit later,\nand I know we will.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nare some other examples?\nI love these examples\nfrom the real world.\nANDY GALPIN: So here's\nthe downside, though.\nSo I only told you\nabout the VO2 max.\nWhat I didn't tell you\nabout is their leg strength\nand functionality.\nAnd that part was\nno more superior\nthan it was their counterparts\nwho were not exercisers.\nSo what that showed really,\nreally clearly-- and many\nother studies have been\ndone since then that\nlook at the classic,\nwhat we call\nlifelong endurance exercisers.\nYou will see, in\ngeneral, their VO2 max,\ntheir cardiovascular function,\ntheir resting heart rate,\ntheir blood pressure.\nIt will be markedly healthier\nthan folks who don't exercise.\nIt is extraordinarily\nclear that type of exercise\nis very important\nfor chronic disease\nmanagement, no doubt about it.\nHowever, it is not sufficient\nfor overall global health\nbecause it does almost\nnothing for leg strength,\nfor any other marker\nof health, which\nwe can talk about, what are\nthe things that are actually\ngoing to predict mortality,\nmorbidity than most.\nSo was a big smashing\nindication that's like,\nhey, this is great.\nHowever, you're leaving\nthings on the table\nfor your overall health.\nNow, one could\nargue, they're 80,\nand they're doing pretty well,\nbut they weren't doing as well\nin these areas.\nAnd so a study we\ndid later, actually,\nas a follow-up was looking\nat monozygous twins.\nSo this is actually interesting.\nBeing a scientist, this\nis a classic example\nof one of my graduate students\nwho had been in my lab\nfor probably three\nor four years.\nAnd she was in our single\nfiber physiology lab.\nAnd you can imagine, she's\nisolating individual muscle\nfibers, from an athlete,\none by one with a tweezer.\nAnd she's going to do several\nthousand individual cells.\nSo you're down there for hours,\nand things happen down there.\nYou kind of lose your mind.\nAnd she was going on one day\nwith one of my colleagues\nand just talking, and\nshe's like, oh yeah,\nmy uncle is really, really\nfit and something or other\nand then.\nOh yeah, he's a twin.\nAnd I was like, oh,\nis he a monozygous?\nAnd she's like, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: For\nthose that don't know,\nmonozygous are identical twins.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah,\nwhich is interesting.\nSo you basically have--\nwhat I'm setting up here\nis this is the perfect\nexercise scientific experiment.\nMonozygous, identical twins mean\nthey have the exact same DNA.\nSo an egg was fertilized,\nsplit, and then two humans\ngrew out of that with\nthe exact same DNA.\nAnd so now we can\nstart answering\nthe question, well, yeah, OK.\nWhat about, maybe, these\ncross-country skiers?\nMaybe they were\njust genetic freaks.\nMaybe it didn't matter.\nIt's like some\npeople have-- well,\ngenetics are always a\ncomponent to it, but how much?\nWell, now we have a\nscenario lining up\nwhere it's like, wait a minute.\nYou have monozygous twins.\nSo we have a replica of a\nhuman being, exact same DNA.\nThe only differences that we\nwould see in their physiology\nnow would be due to\nlifestyle circumstances.\nInteresting.\nSo monozygous twin\ndad and uncle, right?\nUh-huh.\nGreat.\nDo they exercise?\nWell, one of them does.\nHe's a lifelong endurance\nexercise, runner, cyclist,\nswimmer, Ironman,\nall these things.\nWhat about the other one?\nNope.\nHe doesn't exercise at all.\nAnd at that point, I wanted\nto kill my graduate student\nbecause I'm like, you've been in\nmy lab for three years or more,\nprobably, and\nyou've never told me\nthat in your household is the\nperfect scientific experiment\nfor exercise you\ncould ever create.\nAnd Jesus, the look on her\nface when my colleague and I\nwere staring at her.\nShe's just like, oh my god.\nSo I'm like, call\nthem right now.\nThey are coming into the lab.\nFly them in from Chicago.\nI don't care what we have to do.\nWe're getting them in.\nAnd so I wanted to--\nactually, going back\nto the model that was first\ndeveloped by the Harvard\nFatigue Lab, one thing\nthat's interesting about\nthat community is\nthey started off\nwith the concept of trying\nto examine human performance\nthrough a holistic lens.\nAnd so it was the antithesis\nof looking at either organ\nby organ, so we're\ngoing to only look\nat the cardiovascular system.\nWe're only going to\nlook at skeletal muscle.\nAnd then we're saying, we're\nlooking at this entire picture.\nAnd so that model, we wanted to\ncarry through in these twins.\nAnd I said, all right, I want\nto bring them in the lab,\nbut I'm not just going\nto look at one system.\nI want to do everything.\nSo we took stool samples.\nWe took blood.\nWe did vertical jump tests.\nWe did maximum strength tests.\nWe did MRIs of muscle mass.\nWe did VO2 max tests.\nWe did efficiency stuff.\nWe did genetic testing.\nWe did an IQ test.\nWe did psychological battery.\nWe wanted to look at\neverything to figure out\nof these things, what\ndiffer between the twins?\nAnd if so, the second key\nquestion there is, by how much?\nSo can I improve my VO2 max?\nSure.\nEveryone knows\nthat, but how much?\nCan it change by 5%, 80%?\nWhere is the number?\nAnd so putting some\nquantification on this\nwas very important.\nAnd so again, we\nhad another example\nof a classic endurance-only\ntraining paradigm\ncompared to a non.\nSo this is a person\nwho's, I think,\nhe's truck driver by vocation.\nI think, actually, he drove for\na potato chip company, which\nwas even funnier.\nThe endurance athlete\nactually was great\nbecause, like any\nendurance people,\nhe had physical books of\nall of his training mileage\nfor the last 35 years.\nAnd we just went\nthrough them, and we\ncalculated the total\namount of miles he ran,\nhis averages, his\nheart rates per time.\nWe had this unbelievable\nthing, what races he was in.\nHe had the documentation.\nHe was just totally nuts,\nsomething that endurance people\nare like shaking their head\nright now going, oh, yeah.\nI got that too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And endurance\nfolks are pretty nerdy.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nSuper nerdy, right?\nSo it was great because now we\ncould validate, as close as one\ncould, to actually how much\nyou ran and things like that.\nSo they had about\na 35-year discord.\nThey both exercised up\nthrough high school.\nAbout 18, they stopped\ndoing it, and by the time\nI got them in the lab,\nthey're in their mid-50s.\nSo it was about 35\nyears of difference.\nAnd when we ran them\nthrough the testing,\nif you look at the measures\nthat were similar to the Sweden\nstudy, it was almost identical.\nThe exercising twin was\nsignificantly better\nat things like a lipid\npanel, resting heart\nrate, blood pressure, VO2 max.\nAny of those markers, as\npredicted, were much better.\nWhat was very\ninteresting, though,\nwas the things that\nwere in the middle.\nFirst of all, their total\namount of muscle mass\nwas almost identical,\nto the gram,\nwithin the margin of error of\na DEXA scan could possibly ever\nbe.\nThe non-exerciser, though,\nwas a little bit fatter.\nSo the difference in\nactual body weight\nwas explained almost entirely\nby body fat or non-lean tissue,\nreally, same sort of deal.\nSo OK.\nNo one's surprised\nthere that the exerciser\nwas a little bit\nleaner, even though it\ndidn't change total amount\nof muscle mass at all.\nWhen we looked at some of\nthe more functional tests\nand we looked at things\nlike muscle quality--\nso this is a metric you\ncan get from an ultrasound.\nYou can kind of think\nabout this as how much fat\nis inside the tissue,\nwhich is sometimes\nan advantage for an endurance\nathlete to have a little bit\nmore of what are\ncalled intramuscular\ntriglycerides because it's a\nfuel directly in the tissue.\nBut in general,\nthe muscle quality\nhe was not in favor\nof the exerciser.\nIf you looked at the\nperformance testing\nand if you looked at strength,\nit favored the non-exerciser.\nAnd so now, again, we\nhave the same finding\nwe saw in our Sweden study,\nbut in identical twins.\nAnd so it really, really\nhighlighted the fact\nthat if you want to move\nforward with optimal health,\nsimply picking one silo is\nnot going to get you there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOne silo meaning\njust running, just cycling?\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Does this\nmean that the twin that did not\nexercise could jump higher\nor win an arm wrestling\ncompetition?\nNot that that's a\nvital thing to be\nable to do, but just in\nterms of measuring strength,\nit's our isometric strength.\nWas the non-exercising twin\nstronger or at least as strong\nas their exercising twin?\nANDY GALPIN: Yes,\nparticularly in grip strength.\nYeah.\nAnd any of the measures like\nthe vertical jump, leg extension\npower, and a number\nof things, they often\nfavored the non-exerciser,\nwhich you're still\na little bit of a\nchicken and egg.\nYou don't know if, necessarily,\nthe endurance training reduced\nthat other twin's strength.\nIt doesn't even\nreally matter, per se.\nI think the highlight\nof it is, can you\nchange some of these\nmetrics of VO2 max?\nYeah, not even close.\nThese things are very responsive\nregardless of your genetics.\nYour genetics will give you a\nstarting place very clearly.\nEven the non-exerciser\nwas a pretty healthy guy.\nSo they were in a good spot.\nMid-50s, doesn't\nexercise, doesn't really\npay attention to\nhis diet at all,\nand he was in a\npretty good shape.\nHowever, if you want to actually\nmove progress and move forward\nhigh functionality, you have\nto do something besides just\nrun, just distance run.\nNow, I could say the same\nthing for strength training.\nThat alone--\nbecause I don't want\nto make this thing like I'm\nsaying endurance exercises.\nIt worked.\nIn both cases,\nboth these studies,\nthose folks were much\nbetter off in metrics\nthat are incredibly\nimportant to mortality,\nhow long you're going to\nlive, VO2 max, et cetera.\nIt's just not going to get\nthere in terms of strength.\nWe took a look at\nmuscle fiber physiology\nas well, which is\nvery interesting.\nSo what I mean is\nthere's generally\ntwo types of muscle fibers,\nfast-twitch and slow-twitch.\nAnd one of the things that\nis a hallmark of aging\nis a selective reduction\nin fast-twitch fibers.\nAnd that's because it's\ndifficult to activate them\nunless you're doing\nhigh-force activities.\nYou're going to activate\nslow-twitch fibers doing almost\nany activity of daily living.\nAnd so they stay around.\nFast-twitch fibers,\nunless you're\ndoing something of high\nforce or going, not be used.\nAnd they're not going\nto be kept around.\nAnd that's a\nproblem because when\nyou look at things like\nthe need for leg strength\nthrough aging, the ability to\ncatch yourself from a fall,\nthese things are\nincredibly important.\nIf you don't have\nfast-twitch fibers,\nyou don't have the speed to get\nyour foot out in front of you\non time, and you don't\nhave the eccentric strength\nto stop the fall from happening.\nAnd so if you look across,\nagain, the aging literature,\nthey're very clear\nabout the importance\nof maintaining strength and\nfast-twitch fibers over time.\nSo we know that this is\nan important distinction\nhere overall.\nAnd people will often talk\nabout, how much of that\nis genetically determined?\nCan I change my fiber type?\nAnd the answer there\nis resoundingly yes.\nAnd can I change\nit with exercise?\nAnd the answer is,\nabsolutely you can.\nAnd then the next\nquestion is, how much?\nSo now, again, we're going\nto see an order of magnitude.\nIn general, without going\ntoo far down an area\nthat maybe we can\nsave for later,\neach one of your\nmuscles in your body\nhas a different percentage of\nfast-twitch and slow-twitch,\nfor example, your calf.\nIf you look at your soleus,\nwhich is the smaller one that\ngoes in the back, that's\ngenerally mostly slow-twitch,\ntypically 80% or so slow-twitch.\nThe gastroc, which is the\nother one right next to it.\nSo if you were to point your toe\nnext to your face and that part\nthat kind of flexes out\nin the middle pops out,\nthat's your gastroc.\nThat is almost the inverse.\nSo it's generally 80%\nfast-twitch, maybe 20%\nslow-twitch.\nGenerally, anything anti\npostural or postural,\nrather, anti gravity,\nspinal erectors,\nthings that are meant to keep\nyou up or moving all day,\nare going to be slow-twitch.\nAnd things like your hamstrings,\nwhich are for explosion,\nare going to be fast-twitch.\nWell, we biopsied the\nquad in these individuals.\nAnd in that muscle, it's\ngenerally about 50/50,\nfast-twitch, slow-twitch,\nas a really broad number.\nWell, one of the things that we\nfound was in the non-exerciser,\nit was almost textbook\nwhat you would predict.\nIt was about 50%\nor so slow-twitch,\na little bit of percentage of\nfast-twitch, and then about 20%\nor what are these\ncalled hybrid fibers,\nwhich are a hallmark\nof an activity.\nAll right.\nGreat.\nIn the exerciser, it was\nabout 95% slow-twitch.\nAnd so it's extremely\nclear-- again,\nI don't know if maybe their set\npoint was a little bit higher\ntowards that, and the\nnon-exerciser devolved down\nto his place or the other\none, but it doesn't matter.\nI mean, you're going from\n40% slow-twitch in one case\nto 95% slow-twitch\nin another case.\nIt shows you that the limits\nof physiological adaptation\nare darn near boundless\ngiven enough exposure.\nIn this case, 35 years of\nextremely consistent training,\nand his muscle\nmorphology was completely\ndifferent than his identical\ntwin with the exact same DNA.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Those are two\nbeautiful examples of people\ndoing endurance work\nfor a number of years\nand what that\ngives them in terms\nof benefits and functionality.\nHas the opposite experiment\nbeen done or observed,\nwhere somebody's\njust weight lifted\nor just sprinted for\na number of years?\nI don't know that there's\na identical twin control.\nThat's a little--\nANDY GALPIN: No.\nI wish we had a third twin.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--too much to ask for.\nRight, triplets.\nSo triplets out there, if you're\nexercising in different ways\nor people who have\ntriplets, maybe you\nassign one kid to be a runner,\none kid to be a weightlifter,\nand the other one\nto be sedentary.\nPlease don't do\nexperiments like that.\nBut the expectation,\nas I understand it,\nwould be that the person\nthat sprints or that does\nheavy squats, explosive\nwork, would then\nhave more fast-twitch\nmuscle fibers in their quad.\nAnd their non-exercising\ncounterpart would have fewer.\nThat would make sense.\nBut what happens if you assess\nthe endurance level in somebody\nwho's just done strength\ntraining or just sprinted?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nSo we don't have those\ndata specifically.\nWe're actually just starting\nto have studies come out\non lifelong strength trainers.\nAnd there's actually\na very good reason\nfor this, which is a whole\nstory we can get into,\nbut the quick\nanswer is, we don't\nhave a lot of people\nwho've been lifting\nweights for 30-plus years.\nWe have a whole swath\nof people who've\nbeen doing endurance\ntraining for that long.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that\nbecause fewer people\nhave been weight training or are\nthe weight trainers all dead?\nANDY GALPIN: You've got\nto go back to 1953, 1954.\nYou had two major things\nhappen that changed\nthe entire course of exercise\nphysiology and exercise science\nand, really, exercise\nas we know it.\nIt's important to understand\nthe history of our field.\nA lot of the questions\nI get are based\non false assumptions of what\nexercise can and can't do.\nAs an example,\nquestions like momentum.\nShould I use momentum or\nthat's cheating, right?\nOr it doesn't work.\nIt compromises my results.\nIt's actually totally untrue.\nThere are excellent reasons\nwhen you should use momentum\nwhen you lift.\nThere are reasons\nwhen you should not.\nIt is sometimes very\nbeneficial to go fast\nwith the exercise repetitions.\nSometimes very slow and\ncontrolled is better.\nAny question I\nget-- in fact, I'm\nvery infamous for always\nresponding with, \"It depends.\"\nThe reason I say it depends\nis it depends on the goal.\nWhen you're training for speed\nor power or muscular endurance,\nthe answer to some of these\nvery common question differs.\nWhat people fail\nto realize is they\nthink they're asking the right\nquestion because they don't\nunderstand this history, what's\nbeing planted in your brain\nsubconsciously, is\ndriving that question.\nAnd it's not necessarily\nthe right one.\nSo if we walk through\nthat a little bit,\nyou'll see what\nthat field has led.\nWhy you think\ncertain things matter\nwhen they actually don't or\nmaybe your assumptions are\nincorrect and then exactly\nwhat to do about them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand acknowledge our\nsponsor, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is a\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic,\nand adaptogen drink\ndesigned to help\nyou meet all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens daily since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\na sponsor of this podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic\nGreens once or twice a day\nis that it helps me meet all\nof my foundational nutritional\nneeds.\nThat is, it covers my\nvitamins, my minerals,\nand the probiotics are\nespecially important to me.\nAthletic Greens also\ncontains adaptogens,\nwhich are critical for\nrecovering from stress,\nfrom exercise, from work,\nor just general life.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five\nfree travel packs,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin d3k2.\nAgain, if you'd like\nto try Athletic Greens,\ngo to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim this special offer.\nANDY GALPIN: So\nin 1953, 1954, you\nhad Roger Bannister breaking\nthe four-minute mile,\nso subfour-minute mile.\nAnd then you also had Sir Edmund\nHillary and then his sherpa,\nNorgay, summit Everest in the\nsame, basically, two-year span.\nThat exact same year after\nthat was the formation\nof what's called the American\nCollege of Sports Medicine.\nNow, that is still around today.\nIt is the preeminent group\nfor this Exercise As Medicine.\nSo if you're interested\nin things like exercise\nfor obesity prevention, for\ncancer treatment, for things\nlike that-- it's not\nreally sports medicine.\nIt's more for\nclinical exercise--\nthat's the place to go, American\nCollege of Sports Medicine.\nSo we have this\nlaunching of both a ton\nof people wanting to start\ndoing endurance exercise\nand start swimming and\ncycling and running.\nAnd then you have a launch\nof people coming off\nof the back of the\nHarvard Fatigue Lab.\nSo the fatigue lab\nactually shut down in 1947.\nSo you have these people\ninterested in physical fitness,\nbut nowhere to go.\nWell, all those people left\nthe Harvard fatigue. lab\nand started their own\nlabs at other places.\nSo you've launched\nthe careers of people\nlike Dave Costill\nand John Holloszy\nand some of these very famous\nexercise physiologists.\nAnd they start\nbuilding laboratories.\nAnd we start, for\nthe first time ever,\nstudying the\nscience of exercise.\nSo years go by, and\nthese people happen.\nThe 1960s the 1970s is what\nwe call the runner's boom.\nSo people start--\nin fact, if you\nlook at the numbers of people\nwho are doing marathons,\nit explodes through\nthese two-decade spans\nbecause it's like, we could\ndo these endurance feats.\nNotice both those feats were\nendurance, running short term\nas well as going over there.\nNo one has thought anything\nabout strength training\nand here's why.\nIn the late 1880s, there was a\nvery famous physician named--\nGeorge Winship, I\nthink was his name,\nwho was a big proponent\nof strength training.\nWell, he died in the age of 50\nsomething of a heart attack.\nAnd that terrified people of\nstrength training for 70 years\nbecause they're like,\nwhoa, whoa, whoa.\nThat stuff will kill you\nbecause he was a doctor,\nhe was trying-- he was\nrunning around the country,\ndoing these exhibitions and\nreporting it, and then he died.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nsort of like Atkins--\nANDY GALPIN: 100%.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --dying.\nAlthough some people say\nhe died of a heart attack.\nOther people said he\nfell through the ice\ninto cold water.\nThat's debated, but the\nfact that a heavy proponent\nof a given nutrition\nplan dies suddenly.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Not\ngood for business.\nANDY GALPIN: So now the\nlittle storm is brewing.\n1940s-- and I'm going\nback a little bit,\nbut bear with me for a second--\nthere's a guy named\nPeter Karpovich,\nand he's a scientist\nout of Springfield,\nthe decorated\nphysical education,\nPE, that's a legendary\nplace, Springfield College.\nAnd he is anti strength training\nfor a lot of the same reasons.\nIn his entire career, he\ntalked about, don't do this.\nHe's the one that launched these\nideas that strength training\nwill make you lose\nflexibility, it\nwill be bad for kids,\nall these things\nthat we know now are\nclearly not true.\nHe's a proponent\nof these things.\nAnd there is a\nshow that happened\nat Springfield College,\nand a guy named Bob York--\nand if you-- York Barbell,\nthat's still around today--\nis going around the country and\nputting on these exhibitions.\nThey come to\nSpringfield, and it's\nsort of like a\nnew-age social media\nthing, where it's\nlike, the students know\nwhat's about to happen\nbecause Karpovich shows up\nto this event.\nAnd everyone knows he\nhates strength training.\nAnd everyone is like\nwaiting for it to end, just\nto see what he's going to say.\nSo this whole\nexhibition goes on,\nand these people are doing--\nyou've got to remember back\nat the time, bodybuilding,\nweightlifting, power\nlifting, strength, strongman,\nit's all the same thing.\nThere's no differentiation yet.\nAnd it finishes, and\nKarpovich stands up,\nand the crowd goes silent.\nAnd he just asks one question.\nAnd he just points\nto one of the guys\nand says, scratch your back.\nAnd now he's just assuming\nand waiting for the guy\nto be like, ah and\nnot be able to put\nhis hand behind his head.\nAnd I think he pointed\nto John Grimek, who's\na famous bodybuilder.\nAnd he reached back and\nscratched his back, no problem.\nAnd then they proceeded\nto grab two dumbbells--\nI think they were 50-pounds\ndumbbells-- and do a backflip,\nstanding backflip with\nboth in each hand.\nThey started doing\nthe splits on stage,\nand they start performing all\nkinds of physical function\ntests.\nAnd Karpovich is stunned.\nHe's like, holy-- he\nhas nothing to say.\nHe leaves there, and his\nwhole life has changed.\nAll these things he was claiming\nwere shown, in his face,\nto be false.\nHe does a 180 on his career.\nHe starts running study after\nstudy on strength training\nand starts finding\nimmediately there\nare no detriments\nto strength training\nin terms of global health.\nOf course, you can do it\nwrong and things like that.\nAnd in fact, here comes a\nwhole bunch of benefits.\nSo through the 1950s,\nwhile this thing\nis going on with\nthe endurance folks,\nno one's still strength\ntraining because there's\nno record to see.\nThere's no American\nCollege of Sports Medicine.\nThere's no societies.\nThere's no science.\nWe're not sure it's safe.\nAnd meanwhile, Karpovich is\njust hammering study after study\nafter study showing you it's\nsafe, it's safe, is safe,\nbut it hasn't picked up yet.\nAnd then everything\nchanged in 1977.\nThank you, Arnold\nSchwarzenegger.\nHe came out with the trifold.\nHe hits you with pumping\niron, which I know\nyou know that movie, right?\nPumping Iron.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\nan interesting movie.\nEven for those not\ninterested in bodybuilding,\nit's a very interesting\nmovie because it really\ngives a window into not\njust him, but the way\nin which weight training\nstarted to show up\nas a regular practice.\nWhen I was growing up, the\nonly people who weight trained\nwere people preparing for\nfootball, bodybuilders,\nwho basically didn't exist\nin the town where I grew up.\nAnd the only people who did\nyoga were yogis doing Bikram,\nbut now you drive through\nany major American city\nor European city and\nthere is yoga studios,\nthere's gyms with free weights.\nANDY GALPIN: Yup.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nArnold Schwarzenegger\nis largely responsible, I think,\nfor initiating that shift.\nANDY GALPIN: Yup.\nBecause think about it.\nHe hit us with Pumping Iron,\nConan, and then The Terminator,\nalmost in back-to-back--\nvery close, within years.\nSo you've got this whole\ncascade of the '70s of people\nrunning, cycling, and swimming.\nNow, science is starting to\ncome out that it's not dangerous\nand maybe, actually,\nsome benefit.\nAnd then boom.\nNot only is it not\nbad for you, it\ncan make you into a\nreal world superhero.\nI mean, think about the\npsychology of a child\ngrowing up, watching\nsomebody like Conan.\nThink about what Batman looked\nlike in the 1950s and '60s.\nAnd then boom.\nI can look like that?\nNow, not everyone wants\nto look like Arnold,\nbut you see the power\nthat can land in people.\nNo one had ever seen\nor thought you can make\nyour body transform like that.\nYou could maybe be born\nlike that, but no chance.\nThat's within the\ngrasp of all of you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When\nI was a kid growing up,\none of my favorite books was The\nGuinness Book of World Records.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nstill have images\nin my mind of the\ncoldest animal.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nlongest lifespan, et cetera.\nAnd there was a picture in\nthere of Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nAnd you know what\nhis record was?\nIt said, perfectly\ndeveloped man.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which\nis, as you point out,\nthat isn't the physique\nthat most people aspire to.\nANDY GALPIN: It\ndoesn't matter, though.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But it\ndid inspire this shift.\nThe other thing about\nresistance training\nthat I think has a certain\nallure for some people, men\nand women, is that it's one\nof the few forms of exercise\nthat because of the enhanced\nblood flow to the muscle that\noccurs during the training,\nthe so-called \"pump,\"\nit gives you a transient\nbut somewhat real\nwindow into what\nyour results will be.\nANDY GALPIN: 100%\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When you run\nand you're gasping for air,\nyou aren't\nexperiencing what it's\nlike to be faster\nthan you are that day.\nANDY GALPIN: That's correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nwhen you weight train,\nyou get an aesthetic picture\ninto how your functionality\nand aesthetic will change.\nIt disappears a\nfew hours later--\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --as the\nso-called \"pump\" subsides,\nbut it's a very interesting\nform of exercise in that way.\nIt's almost as if you go\nin to learn a language\nand during the process of\nlearning, for brief moments,\nyou're actually fluent, and\nthen it gets taken away.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So it puts\nthe dopamine carrot out\nin front of you.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This\nis just me hypothesizing\nas to why weight training\nmight have taken off\nthe way that it did.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, I\nmean, it's like if you got\npaid every hour on the\nhour when you were working.\nAnd then at the end\nof the day, They\ntake the money back,\nbut you still--\nas the time clock is going on\nin your day, you're looking up,\nand you're watching your bank\naccount grow in real life.\nYou can see why it's so\naddicting to those folks.\nSo to finish the\nstory here, going back\nto your actual question answer.\nThis is happening in the\nlate '70s, early '80s.\nAnd so now Joe Wieder,\nall these gyms,\nthey're exploding because\npeople want to look like that\nor they realize\nthey have the chance\nto change how they\nphysically look.\nThat had never been\na reality before.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Mostly men\nat that point, I'm guessing.\nANDY GALPIN: Almost\nexclusively, yeah,\nfor a large number of reasons,\ncultural acceptance, et cetera.\nEven with endurance stuff, you\ncould get fitter and run faster\nand that's better,\nbut it wasn't going\nto change how you looked\nunless you were losing fat.\nNow you can change\nhow you look, which\nis so incredibly addicting.\nIn fact, there's a\nvery famous quote.\nI think it was\nactually Joe Wieder who\nsaid, \"Show me one man\nwho wants to be strong,\nand I'll show you 10 who\nwant to look strong.\"\nIt's like, that's\nvery, very powerful.\nThere's this a whole--\nthere's tons of this\nhistory I can go into,\nwhich is sort of\nexplaining to you.\nBut now you know you're\nin the mid- '80s,\nand you have what I\ncall my generation.\nSo you have my generation,\nwho fall in love with strength\ntraining in the 1980s and\n'90s, but there's really\nno scientific field for it.\nIt's not really come about yet.\nThe science of endurance\nand exercise physiology\nis now humming along\nat a massive rate\nbecause these people came\nup in the '70s and '80s,\nand they're five, 10, 15\nyears in their career.\nThey're producing.\nThey're generating\ngraduate students.\nThey're starting their own labs.\nAnd they exercise physiology,\nstill to this day,\nis 80% endurance, steady state\nstuff almost exclusively.\nWell, now my generation,\nyou love sports.\nYou love lifting.\nYou love all these things.\nAnd now what we see happen\nis the Chicago Bulls,\nMichael Jordan starts\npicking up strength training.\nOoh.\nThat's on TV.\nHe's on SportsCenter in the\nmid 1990s, lifting weights.\nAnd we go back, actually,\nto the late 1970s.\nAnd I'm not sure if\nyou're a football fan,\nbut any football fan will\nrecognize the Nebraska\nCornhuskers in\nthe 1970s and '80s\nchanged how football's played.\nWell, the reason is because\nthey started strength training.\nAnd they started doing it with\na guy named Boyd Epley, who\nwas the founder of the NFCA.\nSo the National Strength\nConditioning Association\nis formed in the\nlate 1970s as well.\nSo just like ASCM was developed\nthe year after those two\nevents happened, 1978, the year\nafter Arnold comes out, boom,\nNFCA is formed.\nAnd now you have a scientific\norganization dedicated\nto strength and conditioning.\nYou've got NFL strength\nconditioning coaches that\nare starting to come on board.\nYou've got scientists that are\nstarting to come into labs.\nAnd strength conditioning\nbecomes a scientific field.\nWell, everything swings now,\nfrom an exercise perspective,\ninto bodybuilding.\nAnd so almost all\nof the things--\nin fact, we were sort of\ntalking before, I could run\na whole bunch of tricks on you.\nAnd I could ask you a whole\nbunch of questions about things\nthat you think are\nabsolute standards\nor guarantees about training.\nI'm supposed to do this.\nI'm never supposed to do that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: For instance?\nANDY GALPIN: For instance,\nis it OK to train a muscle\ngroup on back-to-back days?\nMost people are at\nhome thinking, no,\nyou're not supposed\nto train a muscle--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nneeds to recover.\nANDY GALPIN: And\nthat's total nonsense.\nOther things like body part\nsplit training, training one\nmuscle group per day,\nother things like cardio,\nendurance training\ninfluencing, will it\nruin my gains for my lift?\nAll of these things are on\nat a base of assumptions\nthat come from bodybuilding.\nNow, that's a fantastic world,\nbut because everything started\nin the late 1970s\nas bodybuilding,\nin terms of-- basically\nstrength training was that.\nWeightlifting and powerlifting\nwere not at all around.\nThey were, but nobody cared.\nAgain, show me someone\nwho wants to be strong.\nI'll show you 10 who\nwant to look strong.\nThe physique thing\njust dominated,\nand we're not getting\nout of that yet.\nWe're not all the way out of it.\nWe're starting to, though,\nbecause here's why.\nPeople started to realize,\nthis bodybuilding thing\nis fantastic.\nI can change my physique.\nI'm getting better, but\ndamn, these workouts\ntake an hour and\na half, two hours.\nAnd I'm going to spend that\nwhole time on one or two body\nparts, which means I'm going to\nhave to lift six days a week,\nand I'm going to have\nto do that consistently.\nNow all of a sudden, boom.\nTwo hours on my elbow flexors.\nDamn, my elbow's\nstarting to hurt.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nyet, my understanding\nis that it doesn't really\nrequire two hours a day--\nANDY GALPIN: Not at all.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --of\ntraining in order\nto get benefits, even\njust for hypertrophy.\nANDY GALPIN: Totally.\nBut a lot of the\ntimes, you're going\nto have to get\nsome amount of time\nin because you're spending\nso much isolation.\nSo we've gone away from\ntraining movement, running\nas a movement,\ncycling as a movement,\ntraining my biceps as a\nmuscle or muscle group,\ntraining my hamstrings\nor a muscle group.\nThat's not a human movement.\nSo we've done a 180 in terms\nof selecting the exercises\nfrom movement-based\nprescription to now muscle\ngroup-based training.\nSo when you're\nisolating muscle groups,\nthat means a whole\nchunk of your body\nis really not doing\nmuch throughout the day.\nSo what happens if you're\ndoing, say, legs on Monday\nand you miss Monday\nbecause you're on a flight?\nNow your legs have to\nwait a whole other week,\nSo this starts to\nbecome problematic.\nPeople start getting beat up.\nPeople start realizing, I\nactually don't feel that great.\nI'm not super fit.\nI'm sweating just\nwalking up the stairs.\nI'm out of breath.\nWhy?\nBecause all that\ntraining, you've\ndone nothing for your\ncardiovascular fitness.\nYou've done nothing to improve\nheart rate, oxygenation,\nblood flow.\nAnd so that paradigm swung way\ntoo hard into the exercising,\nespecially lifting\nweights, is single joint,\noften machine, often slow, often\nhigh-volume isolation stuff.\nAnd that left a giant\nopening of people going,\nwell, wait a minute.\nWhat if you could\nget in the gym,\nI can promise you the\nsame or better result\nin under 30 minutes?\nAnd, in fact, you'll\nalso feel better.\nYou'll lose more weight.\nAnd that opened up\ngroup exercise classes,\nkettlebell stuff, CrossFit\ntype of stuff, circuit training\nbecause you can\ncome in, you won't\nget so beat up because\nthe volume is lower,\nthe time is much lower.\nYou get multiple adaptations\nat the same time.\nGreat.\nThe problem with that,\nthough, fast forward 10 years,\nis it started burying\npeople because you've now\nde-emphasized movement\nquality, and you've\noveremphasized scores.\nSo this is a classic example.\nIf you go and you watch Pumping\nIron or any bodybuilder,\nyou'll see if they're\ndoing a bicep curl,\nthey don't even really pay\nattention to the rep range.\nThey don't really pay\nattention to the load.\nThey are looking\nat their muscle.\nThey're trying to\nfigure out, how\ndo I get that thing to fire?\nThey're squeezing.\nThey're flexing.\nThey're posing at\nthe end of every set.\nThey're trying to figure out,\nam I getting enough pumps?\nIt is exclusively founded\non exercise quality.\nThe rep brains, the\nnumbers, almost irrelevant.\nWhen you go to the other\nmodel, exercise technique,\nit doesn't matter.\nJust get the most\namount of weight up\nor the amount of reps\nor the fastest time,\net cetera, et cetera.\nHigh-intensity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This\nwould be CrossFit.\nI've walked past some CrossFit.\nI've done two CrossFit classes.\nANDY GALPIN: I don't\nwant to get sued.\nSo you said \"CrossFit.\"\nI didn't.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,\nno I enjoyed them.\nI definitely felt like\nI was working hard.\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, you will.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nobserved a lot of people\nin very close proximity\ndoing Olympic lifts\nand doing kipping--\nthat's where you kick\nyour legs, folks, say,\nsort of like bucking and\nkipping type pull-ups. No.\nI enjoyed it.\nIt wasn't for me\nfor the long term,\nbut it did seem that there was\na lot of ballistic movement\nin close proximity\nto other people.\nSo the hazard to me\nseemed more about that\nthan the actual movement.\nANDY GALPIN: Well, again,\nthe point I'm setting up here\nis, that was actually a\nreally brilliant solution\nfor a lot of the problems\nthe classic bodybuilding\nhypertrophy introduced.\nSo it got away from\nisolation movements\nand got people doing\nbig movements, which\nare more effective,\ngenerally better.\nIt got people doing\nthings fast and explosive.\nThat's more athletic.\nThat is more important\nfor longevity.\nIt solved a lot of the problems.\nJoint health wasn't\ngetting crashed.\nThe issue they went with is they\njust pushed the pace on score\nrather than quality.\nThey pushed the pace\non how many people can\nbe in here at the same time.\nSo now you're doing higher-risk\nmovements, higher intensity,\nhigher fatigue,\nand with a total--\nnot that they don't\ncare about technique,\nbut it's not the thing that\nthey're most concerned about.\nIt's getting the number\nand the thing done.\nThey solved the\ntime issue, though.\nYou can get tremendous\nresults in three days\na week, under 45 minutes\neach session, et cetera.\nBurn people out, though.\nWay too much high\nintensity, way too often.\nAnd the other problem,\nsafety concerns,\nall kinds of orthopedic\nissues and other stuff.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can I\ninterrupt you for a moment\nand just ask a question,\nas we go through\nthis arc of the history of why\nendurance training predominated\nor strength training or\nbodybuilding type training\nor CrossFit type\ntraining because I think\nthis is fascinating, and I\nknow we're about to arrive\nat where we are today--\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --and what the\nfuture looks like for people\nand what they should\nfocus on and do.\nAt what point, if\nany, do you think\nresistance training started\nto become adopted by women?\nThere was no equivalent\nof Arnold Schwarzenegger\nthere was Linda Hamilton\nin The Terminator.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: There are\nsome impressive physiques,\ncertainly, on female\nactresses and athletes.\nThe Williams sisters,\nvery impressive\nmusculature and physiques.\nAnd, of course, their tennis\nplaying speaks for itself.\nHas that happened yet?\nWhat I mean is, do you think,\nsince you work with both men\nand women, do you think\nthat most women understand\nthat weight training,\ndone properly\nis going to be extremely\nbeneficial for them, maybe even\nespecially for them, in terms\nof offsetting bone density\nloss and things of that sort?\nOr are we still waiting\nfor the popular stimulus\nfor getting 80% of\nyoung women thinking,\nI want to lift weights?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nHard for me to answer\nbecause I'm not a woman.\nNow, I have a daughter.\nShe's four, so we'll see.\nWhat I can say is, I've\nprobably worked with--\nI don't know how many\nprofessional athletes in total.\nA lot.\nI've worked with them probably\n14 professional sports.\nI've worked with\nCy Young winners,\nMVPs, all the credentials.\nI bet 35%, 40% of the athletes\nI've worked with are female.\nSo I've worked with\nOlympic gold medalists.\nI've worked with bronze\nmedallists in multiple sports.\nI've worked with the most\ndecorated powerlifter\nof all time in a number\nof these areas, fighters,\nworld championship,\nall of these things.\nFor me, I feel like that\nburst has already happened.\nMy students, if you\nlook at my classroom,\nI don't know what\nthe numbers are,\nbut there is no small number\nof females in exercise\nscience and excess physiology.\nIf you look at our laboratories,\nthat's one thing you will see.\nThere are very few female\nexercise scientists.\nThere are very few female\nstrength conditioning coaches,\nbut that number is coming\ndown at an astronomical rate.\nYou have people that are\nbeing hired in every sport.\nYou pick the NFL.\nYou pick Major League Baseball.\nEvery few months we're\nhearing, first female\nhired for this, first\nfemale hired for that.\nThe Yankees, Rachel\nBalkovec is fantastic.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nRachel's been out to my lab.\nShe's terrific.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nOh, yeah.\nShe's fantastic.\nI mean, she's now\nbeing hired as the--\nI think she's a hitting coach\nnow, actual sport coach.\nShe's going to be a GM.\nThis is her goal.\nShe's a terminator.\nSo that's already happening.\nAnd my students that are\ncoming through our program\nare getting placed\nin these roles.\nThey haven't gotten\nthrough yet a lot\nin terms of being\nan actual scientist,\nbut they're getting there.\nSports scientists in the NBA\nare being hired, females,\nin terms of big data collection.\nAnd sports science\nand tech, we'll\ncover in another discussion,\nbut I think it's happening.\nWhether or not the\ncultural and social--\nI can't speak to that\nend of the equation.\nWhat I can speak\nto, though, is one\nof the things I think is\nmost fun coming forward\nscientifically is a\nnumber of years ago,\nNIH came through\nwith their mandates.\nThey're saying, it's no longer\nacceptable to exclude women\nfrom scientific research because\nwe just did that for decades.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nwhat happened-- just\nto fill this in because\nI think it's worth\nnoting is that for many\nyears, studies even on rodents\nwere mainly carried\nout on male rodents\nbecause the assumption--\nand the assumption\nturned out to be wrong--\nbut the assumption was\nthat the physiology\nof female rodents--\nbecause they don't\nhave a menstrual cycle.\nIt's not 28 days.\nThey have an estrus cycle.\nIt's four days, a\ndifferent type of cycle--\nthat would somehow\ndisrupt the data.\nIt turns out that's\nentirely wrong.\nNow it's actually required.\nWhen you sit on a grant study\npanel, which are the people who\nevaluate grants, they ask.\nThey literally say, did they\nmeet the criteria for sex\nas a biological variable?\nHere we're not talking\nabout sex as the verb.\nWe're talking about\nsex as biological sex.\nAnd if you don't say yes, that's\na strong hit against the grant.\nAnd if you say yes, then\nit checks off that box.\nSo it's now required that\nboth male and female rodents\nand humans be studied\nin a given study\nunless the study is specifically\ngeared toward understanding\nthat only exists in one\nor the other population--\nANDY GALPIN: Reproductive\nstudy, things like that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --such as\nmenopause, for instance,\nANDY GALPIN: Yup, totally.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--menstrual cycle,\nandropause, for instance.\nBut no, this is\nextremely important.\nI'm excited to hear that.\nANDY GALPIN: So where I\nwas going to go with that\nis actually, so that was\nstep one, which is cool.\nYou've got to include them.\nWhere we haven't gotten to yet,\nbut I've seen more and more\ngrant applications\ncome through for this,\nit's just the funding\nhasn't it yet,\nwhich is, it's one thing to let\nwomen be in the same studies.\nThat's great.\nIt's another thing,\nthough, to start\nperforming high-performance\nresearch specifically\nfor female questions.\nThat has not happened yet.\nAnd that's just a funding issue.\nWe haven't gotten money yet.\nPeople aren't supporting that.\nWe don't get a lot of financial\nsupport for sports science,\nbut we can't track down\nthe money yet of me going,\nI want to do a study\nin female athletes\nthat answers female\nathlete questions.\nThese won't help men.\nThese are questions\nspecific to the female.\nThat's the next step.\nThat's where we've got\nto get to so we can say,\nmaybe we should do\nthings differently\naround training or recovery\nor we shouldn't or it\ndoesn't matter.\nThere's a handful of--\nnot lower-quality,\nbut some studies.\nI don't love them yet.\nThere just needs to\nbe a ton of work.\nBirth control is a very\ngood example the information\nfor women at female athletes\nor even just hard exercisers--\nyou don't have to be a\ncompetitive athlete--\naround what is\nbirth control doing?\nWhat types?\nHow should I manage that?\nWhat conversations should\nI be having with my doctor?\nAlmost nothing.\nWomen have nothing to go on\nfor high-performance stuff.\nSo what if I'm trying to compete\nin an event or run a race?\nAll those types of questions\nshould be answered.\nNormative value, normative\ndata, performance testing.\nIt's just not there\non the female.\nSo that's an area.\nI think-- if somebody really\nwanted to make a change,\nthe scientists want to do it.\nI know it.\nI've talked to so\nmany in our field\nthat would really\nlove to explore it\nbecause it's getting there.\nLike I said, the coaching\nside is getting there.\nThey're seeing it.\nThey're hiring these people.\nI'm seeing it in my students.\nMy followings is not all men.\nIt's a very large\npercentage of females,\nand all I do is post\nabout exercise science.\nThis is all I do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthis podcast is very--\nwe know very clearly the\naudience is 50% women,\n50% men--\nANDY GALPIN: That's nice.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--which is great.\nANDY GALPIN: So just to jump\nback in our history discussion\nand to finish that point\nof where we're at now\nand where I think we're\ngoing to go or should go.\nSo we walked through the\nbodybuilding running everything\nand people walking into a gym.\nAny time they lift\nweights, they're\nmaking all of their choices\nbased on the assumption\nthat maximizing muscle\nsize is the goal.\nAnd clearly, that's\nnot the case.\nThere are other adaptations\nyou may be after.\nSo we talked about\nhow that had problems,\nand then we talked\nabout how some\nof these other forms of\nexercise filled those gaps\nand then what problems\nthose things introduced.\nWell, I think we're\nactually at a point\nwhere that pendulum is slowly\nshifting into the middle.\nWhat I mean by that\nis, if you want\nto maximize muscle strength, we\nlook towards the power lifting\ncommunity.\nIf you want to\nmaximize muscle power,\nwe're going to look to the\nweightlifting community.\nIf you want to look for muscular\nendurance, well-roundedness,\nmaybe we look into the\nCrossFit communities\nand some of these obstacle\ncourse races or functionality\nthings.\nSo what we can do now\nis generate protocols\nthat get us the exact\nadaptations we want\nand not ones we don't want,\nbecause we can look back\nat each of these different\nstyles of training\nand pick and choose\noptimal protocols\nor combinations for them.\nSo if somebody simply\nwants to get healthy,\nlike we talked about when we\nlisted the nine adaptations\nand I mentioned health\nwasn't one of them,\nthat's because what\ndetermines your health\nversus what determines my\noptimal health differs.\nSo if I need more hypertrophy,\nI can look towards bodybuilding\nconcepts, but if I\nhave enough or maybe\nfor personal reasons, I\ndecide I have too much\nor I don't want to add any\nmore, then I can say, hey,\nhow can I get stronger\nwithout getting bigger?\nAnd boom, I look towards\npowerlifting concepts.\nHow can I get more powerful?\nHow can I get faster but I\ndon't, again, want to lose fat?\nOK, great.\nOr if I want physique changes.\nSo we have all these\ndifferent areas\nwe can pick and choose\nfrom that have expertise\nin specific adaptations\nand develop ourselves\nperfect protocols based\non that information.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'd like to take\na brief break to acknowledge\nour sponsor, InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth and well-being\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nOne issue with a lot\nof blood tests and DNA\ntests out there, however, is\nthat you get information back\nabout various levels\nof lipids and hormones\nand metabolic\nfactors, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes knowing what\nto do with all that information\nexceedingly easy.\nThey have a personalized\nplatform that lets you see what\nyour specific numbers\nare, of course,\nbut then also what\nsorts of behavioral\ndo's and don'ts, what sorts\nof nutritional changes,\nwhat sorts of supplementation\nwould allow you to bring those\nlevels into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nSo with the understanding in\nmind as to how we all, myself\nincluded, arrived at\nsuch lopsided fitness,\ntoo much endurance, not enough\nstrength, too much strength,\nnot enough endurance,\nit's really hard\nto imagine that anyone's\nperfect in this regard.\nCan you walk us through the\nnine different adaptations\nthat you mentioned\nearlier and give us\na way to assess our\nlevel of ability\nor our level of adaptation\nin each of those nine?\nANDY GALPIN: All right.\nThe very first one we want to\ntalk about is movement skill.\nNow, set aside sport specific.\nSo I'm not going to give you\nan assessment for optimal golf\ntechnique swing.\nThis is really\nabout human movement\nso that you stay\ninjury free and you\ncan continue to train\nfor as long as possible.\nSo what are the\nminimum requirements?\nNow, if you can have access\nto a highly-qualified physical\ntherapist or\nmovement specialist,\nthat's the best route.\nGo to them.\nHave them identify all of\nyour movement patterns,\noverhead pressing, squatting,\nrunning, all these things.\nThat's your gold standard.\nIf you want to do it\nyourself, though, here\nis a very simple\nfour-step solution.\nSo the way that I teach\nthis is I go joint by joint.\nAnd so I think of this as the\nmajor ones, your shoulder,\nyour elbow, your low back,\nhip, knee, and ankle.\nNow, what you can do is do\na representative movement\nfor you.\nSo if you bench a\nlot, use the bench.\nIf you do pull-ups,\nuse the pull-up.\nIf you squat, do that.\nI would recommend doing\nan upper-body press,\nan upper-body pull, a lower-body\npress, a lower-body pull.\nAn example would be a push-up,\na pull-up, or a bent row,\na squat, and then a deadlift.\nThat would be a very, very\nwell-rounded approach.\nWhat you're going to\ndo is do that movement.\nAnd I would record\nit for yourself.\nAnd record a frontal\nview and a side view.\nProbably do three to 10\nrepetitions per angle,\nslow and controlled.\nYou don't need any body weight.\nWhat you want to do is move, and\nyou want to look for key things\nat every joint.\nSo again, imagine\nI'm doing a squat.\nI'm going to do a\nsquat, and I'm going\nto focus on just my ankle.\nAnd I'm going look for these\nfour things of the ankle.\nAnd then I'm going to go\nback and watch my knee\nand look for these same\nfour things of the knee\nthrough the hip, et cetera.\nSo what are these four things?\nNumber one is you want\nto look for symmetry.\nSo symmetry is\nfront to back, left\nto right, and your right\nlimb and your left limb.\nAnd so what we want to\nlook for are if they aren't\nmoving perfectly, that's fine.\nBut you want to see\nis one moving further\nahead than the other one?\nIs one turning to the\nside and one's not?\nIs one fidgeting and\ntwitching around differently?\nSo you want to\nlook just to check,\nto see and make sure\nthat they're stable.\nThat's one.\nNumber two, you want\nto look for stability.\nSo a key indicators\nhere are things\nif you can't get through\nSquat, a controlled squat,\nwhere your knees\ndon't start shaking.\nThat would be an\ninstability issue.\nSo can you do the movement slow?\nCan you pause at the bottom,\nmaybe three seconds, maybe five\nseconds or 10?\nYou should have complete\ncontrol of that movement\nand all of these joints.\nAre your hips sliding to\none side when you stand up?\nIs one elbow closer to your\nbody when you're benching\nand the other one's\nmore flared out?\nThese are the things\nI'm talking about.\nI'm not worried about what\nangle they should be at or not.\nYou're simply looking for\nasymmetries or instabilities.\nSo again, as you're\npushing up, does\none elbow start flipping\nand twitching and going\nall over the place?\nThe third one is what\nI call awareness.\nSo there are a lot of\nmovement technique issues\nthat, simply, people don't know.\nAnd so you'll watch them squat.\nI do this in my\nclasses all the time.\nI'll have 100 kids\nout there, squatting.\nAnd you'll see some\nhorrible squat technique.\nAnd then when you\njust tell them, hey,\ndid you realize your heels are\nsupposed to be on the ground\nall times when you squat?\nThey're like, oh, OK.\nAnd they can correct it.\nIt's not actually\na movement flaw.\nIt was just simply an awareness.\nI didn't know, and\nthen I actually\ndidn't realize that was\nhappening that position.\nSo we want all of\nour joints to be\ngoing through a general\nfull range of motion,\nwhich is number four.\nSo the ankle-- during\na squat, your knees\nshould be able to go as far\nover your toe as possible while\nmaintaining good\nposition, your feet\nflat on the floor, your\nthree points of contact,\nyour whole flat foot, and you're\nnot compromising another joint.\nSo that's all\nyou're going to look\nfor are those four things,\nsymmetry, stability, awareness,\nand range of motion through each\njoint, through each movement.\nIt sounds difficult\nand time-consuming.\nIt's really not.\nYou can generally clear\nthese things in one\nor two repetitions in\na couple of seconds.\nAnd what you're really\ngoing to look for-- there's\nlots of scoring schemes you can\ntest, that physical therapists\nwill sort of do.\nI just look for\nabsolutely terrible,\ncan't do it at all, minor\nflaw, or pretty close to good.\nThat's really all\nI'm looking for.\nSo my scoring system\nis zero, one, three.\nZero is like, you're\nnot going to do\nthis exercise because you're\nat a very high acute risk.\nYou might get hurt\non rep one tomorrow.\nNumber one, a score of\none is like, there's\na minor flaw here.\nWe can probably\ndo it, but we need\nto be cautious of\nload and volume.\nAnd the other one is,\nmaybe it's perfect,\nmaybe it's not, but go ahead\nand it on a reasonable protocol.\nYou'll be fine.\nSo that's generally\nwhat you would\nneed to do as a cost-free method\nof identifying good movement\ntechnique within any of the\nthings that you would do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat about speed?\nANDY GALPIN: I actually\ndon't think this\nis one most people should test.\nIf you're a\nhigh-performance athlete,\nwe can run a 40-yard dash or\nwe can do some different things\nwith a velocity\ntransducer on a barbell,\nif you're a weightlifter\nor something.\nFor most people,\npure speed is really\nmaximum velocity\nor acceleration are\nthe two ways we break it down.\nIt's generally not\nthat necessary to test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout number three, power,\nwhich I believe before you\ntold me was speed times force.\nANDY GALPIN: So the reason\nwhy I don't worry too much\nabout speed is because\nyou can infer a lot of it\nfrom a power test.\nAnd a power test is easier to\ndo as well as easier to train\nfor for most people.\nSo the cost-free version\nhere is a simple broad jump.\nSo this is stand\nwith normal position,\njump out as far in front\nof you as you possibly can,\nand measure the distance\nbetween where you started\nand the back of your\nheel, where it lands.\nA super basic number to look\nfor there is your height.\nSo you should be able to\nbroad jump how tall you are.\nIf you're 5' 5,\" you should\nhit 5' 5,\" 6' 5,\" et cetera.\nIt's not perfect.\nThat's going to ratchet down\na little bit, about 15%,\nfor females.\nThey just simply\ndon't have the power,\nin general, that men have.\nAnd so you're going to want to\nbring that down a little bit,\nbut it's a very crude number.\nIf you were to look at a\nhigh-performance NFL player,\nif they're six\nfeet tall, they're\ngoing to be jumping\nnine to 10 to 11 feet.\nIf you can jump\nyour body height--\nwe're not looking\nfor optimization\nin this particular test.\nYou are looking for red flags if\nyou can jump your body height,\nyou're going to be just fine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's\nincredibly straightforward\nand yet, I have one question.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm assuming\nthat I can squat down\nas low as I need\nto before I jump,\nI can swing my arms from\nback to front as harder,\nwith as much momentum\nas I can muster.\nAnd when I land,\nyou said I'm going\nto take the measure from\nwhere the back of my heels.\nANDY GALPIN: You want to measure\nthe distance you actually\ncovered.\nSo to clarify, there's\nno running approach here.\nThere's no steps into it.\nYou're going to\nstand at a still.\nYeah, you can swing, bounce\nas much as you'd like to do.\nYou're going to projectile off.\nSo you're going to\nmeasure the distance\nfrom the tip of your\ntoe-- so basically, stand\nbehind the line and\nthen the furthest\npoint back where you land.\nSo basically, the\nworst possible score,\nnot the best possible\nbecause your feet\nwon't land symmetrically.\nOne's probably going to\nbe a little bit farther.\nNow, technically, if you fall\nbackwards and your hand touches\nthe ground, we mark that\nnumber, but in this case,\njust use the furthest point\nback over your back heel,\nand go from there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be\ntrying it tomorrow morning.\nANDY GALPIN: Now,\nif you have access\nto a little bit more technology\nor you just really want\nto know a better number,\na classic vertical jump\nis a good starting place.\nSo you can actually do this\nin a simple, cost-free way.\nYou can just measure\ntwo of your hands.\nPut them together so that\nboth of your middle fingers\nare touching.\nOverlap them, and put them\ndirectly over your head.\nAnd then you want to reach\nup as high as you can get.\nAnd you mark that on the wall.\nMy brother and I used\nto do this all the time.\nWe would take a highlighter,\nthe yellow ones, and color\nas much as we could\non our fingertips,\ntouch the wall so that\nthe highlighter would\nstain the wall--\nif you actually go back to\nmy house from my childhood,\nyou'll see these markers\nall over our house.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm sure\nyour parents were thrilled.\nANDY GALPIN: My dad didn't care.\nSingle dad, he didn't care.\nHe's just like,\nwhatever, you guys.\nDo whatever you want.\nSo you want to measure that.\nAnd then, of\ncourse, you're going\nto jump with those two hands\nand touch as high as you can up.\nAnd you're going to measure the\ndistance between your standing\nreach and the actual height\nthat you jumped there.\nNow, the reason you're doing\nit two-handed by the way,\nis because if you\ndo one-handed, you\ncan actually reach pretty high\nby offsetting your shoulders.\nAnd now you're getting\ninto differences\nof who has more shoulder\nmobility, who has the ability\nto get up there.\nA two-handed standard\napproach is there.\nSame thing, no\nrunning approach here.\nYou can dip.\nYou can drive.\nYou can do all those things.\nYou can swing your\narms, but you're\ngoing to be a two-handed touch,\nis a general way to do that.\nYou want to look for\na number of something\nlike 24 inches or higher.\nIf you're past the\nage of 50, that number\ncan come down a little\nbit, to closer to 20.\nAnd again, for females, it's\ngoing to be ratcheted down\nabout 15% everywhere you go.\nIf you're a middle-aged female,\nand you're jumping 20 inches,\nyou're in a pretty good spot.\nYou're going to be\nlooking really nice there.\nNow, if you can do\nthat on a force plate,\nthat's even better.\nSo these are,\nbasically, scales that\nwill go out to multiple digits,\nsometimes five to nine digits\npast zero.\nAnd you're going to\nstand on these things,\nyou're going to do\nthe exact same test.\nAnd these are very interesting\nbecause they'll tell you\nnot only how high\nyou jump, but they'll\ntell you how much force\nyou put in the ground.\nThey can also tell you\nhow long it took you--\nand this is called your\nrate of force development--\nas well as impulse and speed and\na bunch of other stuff, which\nare important to help you\nunderstand where on the power\nspectrum you need to be.\nSo you would do that in addition\nto using some sort of velocity\ntransducer on a barbell.\nSo a very classic\nthing to do would be,\nlet's say, you're\ngoing to do a squat.\nAnd you're going to put\nthis device on the barbell,\nand that's going to\nmeasure the speed\nat which the barbell moves.\nAnd you're going to do that at\n40% of your one repetition max,\n50%, 60%, 70%, 80%,\n90%, up to 100%.\nAnd that allows you\nto create what's\ncalled a force-velocity curve.\nAnd you can start to\nsee at what point,\nwhen you start\nloading things heavy,\ndo you start slowing\ndown too much.\nAnd that will tell you what\npart of the force-velocity curve\nthat you want to train in\nto optimize your power.\nWhy that's important,\na lot of people\nwill do things like, when\nI'm training for power,\nhow heavy should I lift?\nWell, the general\nanswer people say\nis, 30% of your one-rep\nmax, but that's actually not\ntrue at all.\nWhat's most optimal\nfor power development--\nwhich we'll discuss\nmore much later--\nis depending on\nwhere you're flawed\nin the force-velocity curve.\nSo if you have access\nto technology like that,\nthat can give you a lot more\ninsight and information.\nIf not, do the broad jump\ntest or the highlighter\non your fingertips and jump\nit up and touch the wall test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: At\nAndy Galpin's house.\nANDY GALPIN: Hey,\njust come along.\nThe walls are already messed up.\nJust go ahead and come up to\nWashington, and we'll do it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fantastic.\nWhat about strength?\nANDY GALPIN: Right.\nSo strength is really important.\nYou need to measure\nthis in multiple areas.\nAnd we'll start off\nwith grip strength.\nSo you can do this in two ways.\nYou can buy a hand\ngrip dynamometer.\nNow, these are anywhere\nbetween $20 to $100, anywhere.\nThese actually used\nto be, when I was\nin school, hundreds of dollars.\nAnd now you can literally buy\nthem on any website for $25.\nSo my honest recommendation\nis technically,\nthat's not cost-free.\nI know your whole thing about\nthe cost-free protocols,\nbut $25, I'm calling\nthat basically cost-free.\nYou can bring that\nin and test that.\nAnd that's just a little device\nwhere you're going to squeeze,\nand you're going to do it.\nAnd I would do your right\nhand and your left hand.\nYou want to look for\nasymmetries there,\nbut you want to look\nfor something like--\ntypically, they're going to\ngive you a value in kilograms.\nAnd you want to look for\nsomething like a minimum score\nhere of 40 kilograms.\nIdeally, you're up past 60 would\nbe a really good spot to be in.\nYou want to make sure that\nthere's no less than 10%\nvariation between your\nleft and right hand.\nYour non-dominant hand\nactually shouldn't be\nthat much weaker in this test.\nSo what you'll actually\nsee, a lot of times,\nis the non-dominant can\nbe oftentimes stronger\nbecause the dominant hand is\nmore for movement precision,\nwriting, things like that.\nSo you want them to be close.\nIf you are a male and you are\nunder 40 kilograms on a hand\ngrip dynamometer, we're\ngoing to need to train that.\nIf you're a female, it's\nnot that much lower,\nbut about 35 kilograms\nis the cutoff point.\nIf you're above 55, we can\nadd it to your training,\nbut I'm not worried\nabout leaving it out\nof your training.\nIf you're a female,\nif it's above 50,\nthat's my cut off of\nwhere we want to go.\nSo that's a fairly cheap one.\nAnother one that\nyou can actually do\nis just a dead hang.\nSo you can hold on\nto any bar, ideally,\none that is thin\nenough to where you can\nwrap your whole hand around it.\nSo you don't want to be\nusing a giant fat grip.\nYou're going to have\na false reading here.\nSo something like\ngoing to the gym\nand jumping on any pull-up\nbar or pull-up rack.\nAnd you want to hang, and\nthis is a simple time test.\nSo in general, we\nshould be able to hang\nfor a minimum of 30 seconds\nis what we're looking for.\n30 to 50 seconds is my\ngood, but we could probably\nget better here.\nIf you're cruising\nabove 60 seconds,\nI'm generally pretty happy.\nThis is actually a\ngood example of when\nfemales tend to be better.\nGrip strength on women\ntends to be strong,\nand they can hang for\nquite a long time.\nSo those standards don't really\nchange that much for women.\nNow, if you are\nexceptionally large,\nthis thing doesn't\nscale perfectly.\nIf you're 240 pounds\nand even if you're lean,\nit's just hard to hang\nand hold 240 pounds.\nConversely, if\nyou're 145 pounds,\neven if you're\nunhealthy, you're going\nto be able to hang\nfor a long time.\nIt's just not that\nmuch weight to carry.\nSo just rough numbers\nto start off with.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's grip strength.\nWhat about strength\nelsewhere in the body?\nANDY GALPIN: The primary\nones, you can do an upper body\nstrength test if you would like,\nalthough it's not technically\nsomething we do very often.\nI'm happy to do it one at\nmax bench press or something\nlike that.\nThat's great.\nWhat I'm generally\nmore interested in\nis a leg extension test.\nAnd the reason I like this\nis, a back squat is better.\nA barbell back squat\nis-- look, that's my jam.\nThat's my life.\nIt's just very\ntechnically demanding,\nand it's challenging.\nYou need spotters.\nYou need comfort.\nA lot goes into this.\nSo for the average person,\na leg extension test\nis fairly standardized.\nYou don't have to\nworry about technique,\nand people can just\nget into it and go.\nAnd so what you want to look for\nthere is a couple of standards\nyou want to hit.\nAgain, a very simple\nanswer here is body weight.\nCan you do a leg extension\nwith your body weight?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: One repetition?\nANDY GALPIN: One repetition.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I can\nanswer that right now.\nANDY GALPIN: Can you?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nANDY GALPIN: You can't?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nI can hack squat a\nreasonable amount of weight,\nbut I was on the leg\nextension this morning,\nand it was a Nautilus machine.\nAnd I certainly could not\nleg extension my body weight.\nANDY GALPIN: Let me clarify.\nWere you doing a single leg?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nANDY GALPIN: So\nbilateral, you can't leg\nextension your body weight?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nBut I certainly can hamstring\ncurl my body weight.\nANDY GALPIN: OK.\nSo we maybe have some\ndeficiencies in our quads\nthat we need to go\nafter, but that's\na pretty good number\nyou want to be at.\nIf you go up in age past\nage 40, every decade that\ncan come down about\n10%, and you'll still\nbe in a pretty good slot.\nSo if you're 50\nyears old and you're\n170 pounds, if you can do 160,\nyou're in a pretty good spot.\nAnd then you could just,\nagain, take it down about 10%\nevery decade after\n40, but prior to 40,\nthere's really no\nchange in strength,\nbut certainly, somebody\nin their 40s to 50s\nshould be able to leg\nextension their body weight.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Noted.\nI look forward to\nour discussion a bit\nlater, talking about\nhow to build strength.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nAny of these\nstrength tests, they\ndon't have to be done to a\ntechnical true one-rep max.\nYou can use what are called\nrepetition conversion equation.\nSo put on a load\nthat you think is\nkind of close to your\nmaximum and just do it\nfor as many reps as you can.\nAs long as it's under\nfive reps total,\nyou can then actually\ngo online and enter that\ninto any number of calculators\nanywhere, and it will tell you,\nOK, you did three\nrepetitions at 200 pounds.\nYour one-rep max is\nprobably 215, whatever.\nSo there's estimate equation.\nSo if you don't want\nto spend the time\nor you're not truly\ncomfortable absolutely\ngoing to your true\none-rep max, just\nget to a number that's fairly\nclose and do as many as you can\nand then go on line, again,\none-rep max estimator equations\nare everywhere.\nIf you get past five\nrepetitions or so,\nthe accuracy of those\nequations starts going down.\nSo don't put on something and\ngo, oh, I did 12 reps of it\nand then try to figure\nout your one-rep max.\nIt'll get close.\nYou start moving past that,\nyou're just getting worse\nand worse and worse accuracy.\nSo I want to make sure whether\nyou're doing the leg extension\ntest or a front squat\ntest, you don't technically\nhave to do it in\nabsolute one-rep max.\nIf neither of those\nare an option,\nanother one I like a lot\nhere is simply a front squat\nor a goblet squat hold.\nSo you're going to hold a\nweight in front of your chest.\nA kettlebell is great here.\nA dumbbell is fine here.\nAnd you want to hold about\nhalf of your body weight,\ngo all the way to\nthe bottom position,\nand try to hold that\nfor about 45 seconds.\nSo it's a pretty good indicator\nof number one, your position.\nIt's hard to be in a bad\nposition for that long\nat that load as well as\ncore strength and low back\nstability.\nSo it's a very\ndifferent indicator\nthan, say, the leg\nextension test,\nbut it's a really nice one.\nIt doesn't require\nmany moving parts.\nIt's more difficult\nthan the leg extension,\nbut it's quite a\nbit more functional.\nAnd it's going to\ngive you insights\ninto a lot more areas\nthan just the quadriceps.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So 45 seconds\ndown at the bottom of the squat\nand then returning to\na standing position.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep.\nAnd if you can't do the\nreturn, actually, I'm\nnot that worried, but as long as\nyou can hold that good position\nwithout a technical breakdown\nin that 45 seconds, that's\na really good spot.\nAs an intro, I want\na third of your body\nweight for 30 seconds.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Terrific.\nI plan to attempt all of those\nstrength tests very soon.\nWhat about hypertrophy?\nANDY GALPIN: Sure.\nActually, before\nwe get into that,\nI want to jump back\nreally quickly.\nIt's important to add\na couple of caveats\nto the strength training stuff.\nSo there's two\nthat I want to do.\nNumber one, these are assuming\nyou are technically proficient.\nSo I don't want you to do\nany exercise to exhaustion\nor to maximum\nstrength if you're not\ncomfortable with your technique.\nSo adjust these accordingly.\nIf you're not comfortable\nwith the front squat,\ndo the leg extension.\nIf you're uncomfortable with\nthat, do something different.\nSo we never want to\nutilize maximum testing\nif it's going to come\nwith a consequence\nof serious acute injury.\nSo that's the most\nimportant flag.\nThe second one is,\nyour warm-up protocol\nwill have a huge effect\non your actual results.\nAnd so whenever\nyou do these tests,\nespecially if you're going to\ndo a test and then a test again\ndown the line, you want to make\nsure that warm-up protocol is\nstandardized.\nNow, again, the NFCA--\nand I can give you resources--\nhas specific guides for exactly\nwhat to do for your\nwarm-up protocol\nprior to one-rep max testing.\nSo we can go there, and\nyou can look that stuff up.\nWe can add that to show\nnotes or something.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nAnd I think when we\nget into a deeper\ndiscussion about\nstrength and hypertrophy\nand resistance\ntraining in general,\nmaybe we could touch into\nthe best warm-up protocol.\nI know I have mine,\nand I'm certain it's\ngoing to be suboptimal\nbased on everything--\nANDY GALPIN: Maybe that's\ncausing the problems.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --based\non every conversation\nwe've ever had, where I\nlearned all the things\nI'm doing incorrectly.\nBut I do make changes on the\nbasis of what you tell me.\nANDY GALPIN: It's not\nincorrectly so much\nas it is suboptimal.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's a very kind way\nof telling me it's incorrect.\nThank you.\nWhat about hypertrophy?\nANDY GALPIN: So\nthe thing you want\nto pay attention to here is,\nyou have the aesthetic portion\nof hypertrophy.\nThat's entirely up to you.\nThere is no rationale.\nYou can decide what you feel\nlike looks good or doesn't\nlook good.\nThat's irrelevant.\nThere is a sufficient\namount you need to have,\nwhere below that, it's\ndetrimental to your health,\nregardless of your outcomes.\nAnd so the best way to do\nthis is a couple of ways.\nAny sort of body composition\ntests can do this.\nSo whether this is a scan\nthrough like a DEXA scan,\nwhich is a gold\nstandard or other ways\nof biological, bioelectrical\nimpedance or otherwise.\nSo there's a ton\nof different tests\nyou can get that\nare pretty close.\nSo what you want\nto pay attention\nto when you get a DEXA scan\nis a number called FFFMI.\nAnd so that stands for\n\"fat-free mass index.\"\nSo you can look at again, any\nnumber of online calculators.\nThese are all standard,\nso it doesn't actually\nmatter where you pull them up.\nYou don't have to worry\nabout looking it up\nand whether or not it's\nright or not or something.\nAnd so that's going\nto actually tell you\nif you have sufficient\nmuscle mass.\nAnd so a number you want to look\nfor, in general, is something\nlike if you're a\nman, your FFMI should\nbe something like 20 or higher.\nIf you're a woman, you want\nto look for something like 18.\nSo those are the targets.\nIf you get past\n24, 25 for a man,\nthat's a lot of muscle\nmass, assuming you're\nreasonably lean.\nNow, if your FFMI is like 24,\n25 but your body fat is 40%,\nyou're actually just a\nvery, very large individual.\nYou're not in a great spot.\nSo when we say these\nsort of numbers,\nit's the assumption\nthat you're probably\nsub 30% body fat for a man\nand sub 35% for a woman.\nSo those are the numbers.\nThere are online calculators.\nAll you really need to know\nis your total body weight,\nyour body fat percentage,\nand then your height.\nAnd you can enter\nthose three numbers,\nand then they'll tell\nyou your FFMI score,\nand it'll correct for\nan adjusted value.\nAnd then most of\nthose will actually\ntell you the grading\nrubric and then they'll\nsay, good, average,\nbad, et cetera,\nbut those are the\nnumbers we look at.\nIf you are, as a man, sub\n17, as a woman, sub 15,\nnow we're in an area of pretty\nsevere physiological detriment\nfor insufficient muscle.\nAnd in some of our\nlater discussions,\nwe'll talk about\nwhy that matters.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's\nnot sub 17% body fat.\nThat says\nspecifically, the FFMI.\nANDY GALPIN: That's\ncorrect, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout muscular endurance?\nIs this where you're going to\ntell me I need to do wall sits?\nANDY GALPIN: So\nthis is really nice.\nYou can do any\nnumber of tests here.\nA standard plank it is a good\ntest of muscle endurance.\nSo can you hold a front\nplank for 60 seconds?\nCan you hold a side\nplank for 45 seconds?\nPretty easy.\nIf you're able to do a push-up.\nSo if you can't, that\nsort of tells you alone.\nIt's actually interesting.\nIf you can't do\na single push-up,\nthat's not a muscular\nendurance issue.\nThat's actually now\na strength issue\nbecause that's a\none-rep max problem.\nSo we want to be able to--\nagain, for a general male, we\nshould have no problem doing\n25 plus consecutive push-ups.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I apologize\nfor interrupting you,\nbut as long as we're\ntalking about push-ups,\ncould you just mention form?\nAre we talking chest\ntouching the ground?\nElbows breaking right angles?\nWhat is a proper push-up,\naccording to your laboratory?\nANDY GALPIN: Unless you\nhave a very specific reason\nto limit range of motion,\nI want all my testing\ndone through a full\njoint range of motion.\nThis is different\nfor the person.\nSo it's individualized to them,\nbut in general, for a push-up,\nthis would be a full\ncomplete lockout\nof the elbows on the top\nand a full chest touch\nor close to it at the ground.\nYou can do it different.\nIt doesn't really\nmatter, but just\nkeep it standard from your\npretest to your post-test\nif you're trying\nto mark progress,\nbut for us, unless we have\na very specific reason,\nwe're going full range of\nmotion for all of these tests.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo 25 push-ups for a male.\nANDY GALPIN: 25 push-ups\nfor a male is the standard.\nAnd even something\nlike 10 is a number\nwe're looking for, again,\nas minimum categories\nfor an upper body\nmuscular endurance.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And not to\nget too down in the weeds,\nbut I have observed\nother people-- of course,\nnever myself.\nNo, I'm kidding-- but\nobserved other people\npausing maybe at repetition\n15, catching their breath\nand then continuing.\nANDY GALPIN: That\nwould be a fail test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\ncontinue like a piston.\nANDY GALPIN: That\nwould be a fail test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So no pauses.\nANDY GALPIN: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just\nup down, up down,\nand trying to hit at\nleast 10, but ideally 25.\nANDY GALPIN: I learned this\nlesson in one of our studies,\nprobably nine years ago,\nwhere we didn't clarify that.\nAnd so we actually\nhad an individual--\nhe wasn't being nefarious.\nHe just figured out, if I do\na couple, take a quick break\nand do a couple, he quadrupled\nhis post-test results\nfrom his pre-test result\nbecause he figured out\nthat little hack.\nSo you want to standardize it.\nIt's not that I'm\nagainst or have\nsome sort of strong belief.\nIt's just trying to keep\nprotocol standardized, which\nmeans any break, failed test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So 10 to 25\npush-ups, minimum, for males.\nWhat about for females?\nANDY GALPIN: So I'll clarify.\nIf it's sub 10 for\na man, that's again,\nand you're like, very\nsevere red flag problem.\nWe really, really like\nto see a number above 25.\nThat's where we're anchoring.\nAnything between 10 and 25 is\nlike, yeah, but not severe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It means\nthey have work to do.\nANDY GALPIN: We have work to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd for females?\nANDY GALPIN: For\na female, you're\ngoing to scale that back.\nSo a female, the answer\ncould be as little as zero.\nSo you're going to see that,\ncan you do a full position?\nIf they're in that\nposition, we're\ngenerally not going to do\na muscular endurance test\nfrom the knees.\nWe already know the\nanswer is you're zero.\nWe'll actually default to\nanother test, which I'll\ntalk about in a second here.\nSo for those folks, that's going\nto scale down a little bit.\nSo basically, you're looking\nat 15 is that marker, like 25\nwas for the male, where\nI want to see above 15.\nAnd if I do, we're good.\nAnything between five to\n15 is the number of, OK.\nIf you're sub five, we\ngenerally have some problems.\nAnd if that is different,\nbetween one and zero,\nthen zero is a problem.\nSo we should be able to do that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if a female\ncannot do 10 full push-ups.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\n10 full push-ups hard for a\nfemale, depending on size.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nLet's say a female can't do\nfive full push-ups. You said,\nrather than go to a\nknees-down version,\nwhat would you do to assess\ntheir muscular endurance?\nAnd would you then\nalso encourage\nthem to work on their strength?\nANDY GALPIN: Well, absolutely.\nSo again, if they\ncan't do-- they\ncan do anything less than three,\nyou're going to be strength.\nIn fact, if you want to look at\nmuscular endurance in general--\nso this is a bit\nof an off topic,\nbut I promise I'll\nkeep it short,\nand I'll come right back.\nWhen I was a doctoral\nstudent, I had two lab mates.\nOne of them was a runner,\na female, 120 pounds,\nsomething like that, small.\nThe other one was a male,\nand he was basically\nlike a straight bro,\nhe lifts weights,\ndoesn't do any other\nsort of training.\nDoes a very classic not training\nprogram, but kind of training.\nAnd they were bantering\nback and forth for a while.\nAnd basically she was\nsaying, you're so unfit.\nYou can't run at all.\nAnd he's saying, you're so weak.\nYou can't do a pull-up.\nAnd so they challenged each\nother to a competition.\nThey said, at the\nend of the year,\nthe girl is going\nto do 26 pull-ups,\nand the guy had to run\na marathon, so 26 miles.\nSo that was the thing.\nAnd then there was some sort of\nconsequence for whoever failed.\nSo the guy quickly tried\nto figure out, how the hell\nam I going to run 26\nmiles when I have not\nrun a mile in many,\nmany, many years?\nSo he just started running,\nthree miles, four miles,\nwhatever.\nWell, of course, both of\nthem ran immediately to me.\nAnd then she was\nlike, how the hell?\nI can't do a pull-up.\nAnd I was like, great.\nAnd I gave her a very specific\nmaximal strength protocol.\nAnd she was like, whoa.\nI want to go to the\nassisted pull-up machine\nand work on doing sets of\n25 because I've got to get\nmy muscular endurance up.\nAnd I tried to explain to\nher, your muscle endurance\nis irrelevant if\nyou can't do one.\nIt's never going to matter.\nShe did the muscular endurance\nprotocol, the entire thing.\nDidn't listen to me.\nThe end of the year came.\nShe still produced\nexactly zero pull-ups.\nSo the point is, if you\nlook at muscular endurance,\nwhere is it strength\nand where is it actually\nmuscular endurance?\nThe general number that you're\nlooking for is under 80%.\nThat's going to tell you,\nis this a muscular endurance\nproblem or is it an\nabsolute strength problem?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Under 80%\nof a one-repetition maximum?\nANDY GALPIN: Yup.\nSo what I mean by that is this.\nIn fact, this actually\nis in your question.\nThe other way to assess\nmuscular endurance\nis take the exact strength\ntests you did from the talk\nfive minutes ago,\nwhich one did you do?\nLoad that to 75%, and then do\nthat for as many repetitions\nas you can.\nAnd that is a\ntremendous barometer\nof muscular endurance.\nSo if you were able to do 200\npounds in your leg extension\ntest, put 75% on that and do\nthat as many reps as you can.\nYou want to look for more\nthan eight repetitions.\nIf you are below\neight repetitions,\nthen we have a muscular\nendurance problem.\nIf it is higher than that,\nif you've got 15 or 20,\nthen we know we have\nprobably some problems\nin your peak strength\nor the test itself.\nSo that is a good--\neight to 12 number\nis where you want to be\nlooking at for there.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout anaerobic capacity?\nANDY GALPIN: This\none's more challenging.\nYou either have to\ngo to a laboratory\nand do something\nlike a Wingate Test.\nSo this is a\n30-second maximal test\nwhere you're going to see how\nmuch work can you possibly do\nin that 30 seconds.\nIf you don't have\naccess to laboratory,\nyou can do this on\nany protocol you want.\nThis could be sprinting.\nThis can be on an air bike.\nThis could be on\na rower, anything\nlike that, anything where\nyou can exert maximal effort\nand you don't have to worry\nabout technical problems.\nSo I generally don't like to do\nthings like a kettlebell swing\nor something like that.\nThere's just too\nmany other variables.\nYou need to be able to go\nas hard as you possibly can,\nknowing you're going to get to\na place of tremendous fatigue.\nNow, in the lab, we often use\nwhat's called a Bosco Protocol.\nAnd you're going to\nstand on a force plate,\nand you're going to do\nas many vertical jumps\nas fast as you can, as high\nas you can, for 60 seconds.\nAnd you are absolutely\ndestroyed by second 45.\nSo we'll either use that\nWingate Protocol or that Bosco\nProtocol.\nIf you want, though, again,\ntake any of those other places,\n30 seconds or so,\nup to 45 seconds,\nup to a minute if you want,\nit doesn't really matter.\nAnd you just mark down\nthe distance you cover.\nThat's all.\nWe don't really have\nstandards for these things\nbecause it's going\nto be different.\nHow far you can travel in\n30 seconds on a treadmill\nis just going to be so different\nthan sprinting in the field\nor on the assault\nbike or whatever.\nSo what you really want\nto worry about there is,\ncan you complete it?\nAnd then how awful do\nyou feel afterwards?\nSo what you really want\nto think about here\nis not those\nprotocols, but this.\nYou want to think\nabout can you get\nclose to your predicted\nmaximum heart rate?\nSo the number we throw\nout is 220 minus your age.\nSo if you're 50 years\nold, 220 minus 50,\nyou should be able to get\nto a maximum heart rate\nof around 170 beats per minute.\nNow, that number is\nextremely generic.\nIf you don't get there,\nthat doesn't have\nany indication of your fitness.\nIf you get higher, that doesn't\nmean you're any more fit.\nIt's just a rough number.\nSo here's what I want you to do.\nIn this case, your heart rate\nrecovery is the better metric.\nSo I want you to get up\nto a maximum heart rate\nand then test your\nheart rate recovery.\nAnd what you should\nbe looking for there\nis about a half a beat\nrecovery per second.\nSo you're going to\nget up to a place\nwhere you reach absolute\nterrible exhaustion,\nmaximum fatigue, test your\nheart rate, and then count.\nHave a timer going.\nWithin 60 seconds, you\nshould have, again,\nthat half a beat per second.\nYou should have a\nheart rate recovery\nof 30 beats per minute.\nWithin the next minute,\nso two-minute recovery,\nit should be, again,\nhalf that, so 60 beats.\nThose are rough\nnumbers to go by.\nAnd your three-minute recovery\nis, again, half of that again.\nSo that is the closest way.\nIf your heart rate recovery\nis worse than that,\nthen we know we have a problem\nin your anaerobic capacity\nor your cardiovascular capacity.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nWhat about number eight,\nmaximal heart rate?\nBecause what you\njust described sounds\na lot like maximal heart rate.\nANDY GALPIN: So this\nis your VO2 max.\nSo the gold standard here is to\nactually go into a laboratory\nand get this thing done.\nSo we can actually run a VO2 max\ntest, where you put a mask on,\ncollect all your gases,\nand run you to there.\nAnd there is a very specific\nprotocol for completion\nof a true maximum test.\nAnd any scientist\nwill know that.\nIf you don't have\naccess to that,\nyou can do a couple of tests.\nOne of them is called a\n12-Minute Cooper's Test.\nSo this is simply time.\nYou're going to run for 12\nminutes as far as you can,\nand you're going to record\nthe distance you covered.\nAgain, you can go online to\nany number of calculators,\nenter that distance in.\nAnd that will tell you your\nproximal or estimated VO2 max.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nthat's a 12-minute sprint.\nANDY GALPIN: 12-minute\nsprint, maximum distance\nyou can cover in 12 minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Keeping a\nsteady pace the whole time\nor going--\nANDY GALPIN: Do\nwhatever you want.\nThe goal is to get maximum\ndistance covered in 12 minutes.\nSo that's anywhere between\na mile to two plus miles,\ndepending on how fit\nyou are, but you just\ndo that Cooper 12-Minute Test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nANDY GALPIN: I told you.\nSo if you remember,\naerobic capacity\nis eight to 12\nminutes where you're\ngoing to see a real true\ntest of that VO2 max.\nYou simply can't get that\nin under a few minutes.\nSo if you want, you can do a\nlittle gentler version of that.\nSo there are a number\nof submaximal tests.\nIn fact, there is a one-mile\nwalk test you can do.\nSo again, all you're going\nto do is-- in this case,\nyou have to have of either a\nstopwatch or, ideally, a heart\nrate monitor.\nAnd all you have to do is--\nthis is a walk for one mile\nsubmaximal test.\nSo you're going to walk\na mile, record the time,\nrecord your heart rate at\nthe end, enter those in.\nAnd those will give you, again,\nestimates of your VO2 max.\nSo that's the like, oh my gosh,\nI can't run for 12 minutes\nas hard as I possibly can\nor I don't want to do it.\nWe have a lot of these\nin our executive program.\nIt's like, my knee\nhurts too bad.\nI've got back pain\nwhen I run or whatever.\nCan I-- OK.\nAnd you do the walk test.\nAnd it's pretty accurate\nif you do it correctly.\nSo technically, all\nyou have to actually do\nis measure your heart rate on\nyou neck and count 60 seconds,\nbut it's just easier to--\nwith everyone's\nwatches and stuff now,\njust wear the heart rate\nmonitor, plug in those numbers.\nAnd again, those are all\nstandard calculations.\nSo anywhere you find\nthose, you don't\nhave to worry about the source.\nSo you just enter your\nstuff in, and they're\ngoing to be running\noff the same equation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I like the\nidea of the 12-minute run.\nI'm going to give it a\nshot, see what happens.\nANDY GALPIN: For years, we did\na one-mile version of this,\nand there's just a lot more\nscience on the 12-Minute Cooper\nTest.\nSo we did that.\nIt's pretty good, and it is\nnot even remotely close to fun.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It sounds\nlike fun for other reasons.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah, yeah.\nWell, it is it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Fun in the\nsense that it reveals a lot.\nANDY GALPIN: Yup.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\npowerful, potent.\nANDY GALPIN: Super.\nThere's no hiding.\nYou can hide with the\nleg extension test.\nIt doesn't hurt that bad.\nBut you cannot feel anything\nbut the 12-minute \"run as far\nas you can\" test.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So these\nare really, actually,\npsychiatric diagnostic tests--\nANDY GALPIN: They are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --of a sort.\nANDY GALPIN: For sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Number nine,\nlong-duration, steady-state\nexercise.\nI think of this as a.k.a.\nendurance, but as you\nmentioned before, there\nare other forms of endurance.\nSo long-duration,\nsteady-state exercise.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep.\nSo you really want\nto think about this\nas not a standard number.\nYou should maintain\nconsistent work output\nfor over 20 plus minutes.\nAnd this one I want you\nto just pick something\nthat it was in your lifestyle.\nSo is there a loop around\nyour house that you can do?\nIs there some protocol that\nyou like to use before?\nAnd you're simply going\nto test your ability.\nCan you maintain work\nwithout stopping?\nThat's all it needs to be.\nNow ideally, I personally\nlike to throw a little twist\nin here, which is, can you do\nthis with nasal breathing only.\nThat's when I feel really good.\nIf you can go 30\nstraight minutes\nwithout needing\nto take a break--\nwalking doesn't really cut it\nunless you're very, very unfit,\nin which case, if walking\n30 minutes without a break\nis a challenge, OK.\nThere.\nBut if you can, I want you\nmoving at a non-walking pace.\nI don't care what zone this\nis, two, three, four, five.\nI don't care.\nShow me you can maintain\nminimum of 20 minutes of work\nwith no breaks, no intervals,\nno downtime and, again,\nideally breathing\nthrough your nose only.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love this\nlist, but it worries me a bit.\nNot because any one of\nthese tests is necessarily\nthat overwhelming,\nbut because I'm\nunclear about how to\narrange performance\nof these different tests.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: For\ninstance, do I separate them\nso I'm doing one test, like\nlong-duration output on one day\nand I'm doing strength\non another day?\nThose seem pretty obvious\nto me, but are there\nones that one can combine\non different days?\nHow much time should one give\noneself in between these tests?\nAnd how often should\none do an assessment?\nJust as we don't want\nto necessarily evaluate\nbody weight changes by getting\non the scale three times\na day, maybe once a day\nat the same time each day\nis more practical.\nHow often should we be\nassessing our fitness for each\nand every one of these?\nANDY GALPIN: Well, the way\nthat I would say this is, you\nwant to pick the one\nthat is the worst\nand do that more frequently.\nSo if, for example, you do\nthe upper body strength test\nand you are fantastic, if\nyou can bench press double\nyour body weight, I don't need\nto test your bench very often,\nfor the average person.\nIf you're not a powerlifter,\nmaybe once a year or something.\nMaybe not even that.\nWe just don't need to get there.\nHowever, if we then test your\nVO2 max and in your 12 minutes,\nyou cover a total\nof a half a mile,\nthen we might want to\ntest that every month.\nAnd so we're going to let our\npriorities emphasize which one\nwe're going to do more often.\nI would recommend doing this\nfull battery once a year.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Full battery,\nmeaning the entire list\non one day.\nANDY GALPIN: No, not on\none day, but within a week.\nSo you could take a week.\nNow, you could do these,\ntechnically, all in two days.\nThree-day split here\nis probably best.\nSo if you were to just say,\nhey, this is testing week.\nI actually love this for\nbeginning of the year\nor whenever it is that\nyou change your training,\nbut I think once a year,\njust like once a year you\nshould probably\ngo to a physician\nand get full bloodwork, a\nfull heart scan and everything\nlike that.\nAnd then if maybe you\nhad a heart issue,\nthey would come back in and test\nyou more frequently, whatever\nthe case is.\nYou should probably\nrun through this.\nAnd you're going to\nbe thinking, yeah,\nbut I don't want to give up on\nmy exercise routine that week.\nWell, I promise you, you're\nnot going to finish this week\nand think, I didn't do\nvery much work this week.\nIt's going to feel great.\nAnd then you're going to\nhave a very nice barometer\nof exactly where you need\nto change and prioritize\nyour training for the next\nquarter or half a year\nor wherever you want to go.\nIf you want to actually\ndo this every six months,\nwe end up, actually, doing\nthis, quite honestly,\nmore like every six\nmonths as a general test.\nThat's a really\ngood way to do it,\nbut minimum, if you're\narguing with me,\ngive me once a year that\nyou want to do this.\nSo which order to do them in?\nThe non-fatiguing tests,\nyou can do whenever.\nSo this is the body composition\nscan, the FFMI, the body\nfat composition.\nAll this stuff can\nbe done whenever.\nI generally like\nto do that, though,\nas your very first activity.\nThe reason is we know that\nacute exercise can heavily\ninfluence things\nlike body composition\nmeasurements because of\ninflammation, water storage, et\ncetera.\nSo it's easiest to just get\nthat off of a 48 hour rest.\nYou want to make sure you don't\ndo any hard exercise the day\nbefore a body composition\ntest and probably 48 hours\nbefore that.\nSo just start yourself\noff with that.\nYour movement tests\ncan be the same thing.\nYou don't want to try to do a\nassessment of how well you're\nsquatting if you're incredibly\nsore from your brutal squatting\ntest.\nSo tend to do those things\nwhen you're the most fresh.\nThen what you want to do is\nany skill or maximum strength\nor power goes at the very\nbeginning of the day.\nAnd any fatiguing thing\nhappens at the end.\nAnd so you could easily do this.\nAll right, I'm going to do\nmy power test, my broad jump,\ngreat.\nYou're not going to be\nfatigued at all from that.\nAnd on the same day, since\nI'm already pretty warmed up,\nnow I'm going to roll right\ninto my leg strength test.\nAnd since I'm really\nwarmed up, I'm\ngoing to do my leg muscular\nendurance test right there.\nSo this is a very\ncommon strategy we use.\nWe do our one-rep max leg\nextension, five minutes,\nseven minutes, whatever we\nneed to do, come back, load it\nto 75%, do as many\nreps as you can.\nBoom.\nYou could roll right into,\nthen, your upper body\ntest or your grip strength\ntest or anything else\nthat you want to do there.\nIs there a little\nbit of influence?\nYeah, but really, for most\npeople, it's not that bad.\nWhat influence I mean.\nIf you do a leg strength\ntest, coming back and doing\nan upper body strength\ntest afterwards,\nit's not that big a deal.\nGive yourself 15, give\nyourself 20 minutes.\nGive it plenty of time.\nSo you can knock out\nyour strength testing\nand muscular endurance\ntesting all in one day.\nYou could do your performance,\nyour skill diagnostic,\nyour power jump\ntest, your strength,\nand your muscular endurance, and\nall that stuff is knocked out.\nYou're going to have to\ncome back on a separate day\nand do your anaerobic tests.\nThis is 30-seconds maximal\nendurance, things like that.\nYou could, though, if\nyou wanted, do that\nafter your long duration tests.\nYou're long duration\ntest again, is just\ngoing to function\nas a big, warm up.\nOr you could flip\nthose things or you\ncan do them on separate days.\nYou're going to have to do your\nVO2 max test on its own day,\nfor the most part, unless\nyou wanted to do, again,\nyour movement or\nyour body composition\nbefore those things.\nSo you really have the\nability to mix and match.\nIdeally, this most realistically\nprobably takes three days.\nIf you want to separate\nthem into four or five,\nthe more separation\nyou do, the better data\nyou're going to get.\nIt's just a question of how\npedantic are you really trying\nto get here?\nAnd are you willing to lose\n5% to then save a whole day?\nThen you can do these\nthings in multiple stacks.\nSo that's how I\nwould break it up.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo what I'm hearing\nis, better to do it\nthan to not do it.\nANDY GALPIN: Most definitely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd be rational.\nDon't try and do\nyour strength output\nlate in the day when\nyou're fatigued.\nIf you're going to combine\nsome of the steady state\nendurance and maximal\nheart rate, fine.\nUnderstand there might be a\nslight deficit there, but test\nit the same way each time.\nAnd what you're really\nlooking for is improvement.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep.\nAnd you can also do\nthe heart rate recovery\nunder any of the modalities.\nSo you could do the heart rate\nrecovery after your VO2 max\nas well.\nSo you finish that\nthing, and then\njust, again, do the same\ntest for up to three minutes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: These\nare fantastic tools.\nI'm almost tempted to say that\nI'm willing to post my numbers,\nbut that actually violates the\ncore principle that I think\nwe're getting at here,\nwhich is that it's highly\nunlikely that anybody is\ngoing to be phenomenal\nacross the board.\nI mean, certainly there will\nbe individuals that are,\nbut based on everything\nwe talked about earlier,\nspecificity of training and\nhow extensively somebody has\nbeen training a certain way\nwill, without question, lop\nside them, if you\nwill, toward being\nbetter in some of these\nassessments and less good\nin others.\nAnd that's just simply the way\nthat these adaptations work.\nANDY GALPIN: Yep.\nYou don't need to be optimal\nin all of these areas to be,\nquote, unquote, \"optimal\nhealth\" from this perspective.\nYou just want to\nmake sure, again,\nthere's no severe\nperformance anchors.\nThis is what we call them.\nWe don't want any of\nthese severe constraints\nbecause you're going to\nget limited by that thing.\nAnd so what you want\nto do is move that up\nto just sufficient or concerning\nand get it away from that.\nIf you do that, that thing's\nnot going to catch you.\nYou're going to be able to\ncontinue to pursue optimization\nin any of the one\nthings that you\nhave a specific\npassion for, which\nis generally what moves people.\nYou train so that\nyou feel better.\nYou train because you know there\nare all these benefits to it.\nAnd jeez, this audience probably\ncould list hundreds of them.\nBut you also train\nbecause you generally like\nto get better at something.\nA lot of us have something.\nAnd so you want to make\nsure that you're not going,\nhey, I know you're\ngood at endurance,\nbut you really\nshouldn't train anymore.\nWe don't want that\nmessage, not at all.\nI want you to love\nyour training.\nWe just want to make sure\nthat you're not loving that\nso much that you're not taking\nsome blinders off and missing\nanother area, which\nwould actually--\nagain, you pull that performance\nanchor, this whole ship sails\nfaster, with less effort\nand less friction.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What I love\nabout this is also that,\nas you've described\nit, it's not just\nfor athletes or people that\nare super into fitness.\nIt's also for people that just\nwant to be healthy and want\naesthetic changes.\nAnd that's why they're\nexercising, which, I think,\naccounts for a fairly large\npercentage of people out there.\nSo I think what you described\nis incredibly well-structured,\nincredibly clear, and\nincredibly actionable.\nSo I want to thank\nyou for that I'm\nserious about my willingness\nto do this and at least share\nthose numbers with you.\nAnd I think for most people that\nare seeking what you listed off\nbefore aesthetic\nchanges, functionality,\nand longevity, it's clear\nthat all nine of these\nare going to be important\nin some regard or another.\nANDY GALPIN: So\nbefore we close out,\nI want to go back and finish\noff the metrics for VO2 max\nbecause I don't actually think\nI gave you numbers on that.\nSo in general, for\nmen, a minimum number\nwe want to look at\nhere is 35 milliliters\nper kilogram per minute.\nAnd for women, that\nwould be about 30.\nSo we can actually push a\nlot higher on those things.\nIn reality, I want\nto see men above 50.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: If I could\njust interrupt you for a second.\nWhen you say 40 milliliters per\nkilogram, milliliters of what,\nspecifically?\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nSo what, actually,\nthose metrics mean is\nthe first one,\nmilliliters, is oxygen.\nSo it's amount of oxygen.\nKilograms is body weight.\nSo it's, how much oxygen can\nyou bring in per kilogram\nof body weight per minute?\nSo does a volume of oxygen per\nyour size in a time duration.\nIn fact, the way\nthat you calculate it\nis you multiply your\ncardiac output by what's\ncalled your a-vO2 difference.\nYour cardiac output is your\nheart rate times your stroke\nvolume, so how much blood\nyou're pumping out per pump\nis your stroke volume.\nHow many times you're\npumping or you're beating.\nYou multiply that by\nyour a-vO2 difference.\nYour a-vO2 difference is\nartery minus vein difference.\nSo it's the amount of\noxygen in your arteries\nminus the amount of\noxygen in your vein, which\nis going to tell you\nhow much you took up\nin your capillaries,\nin your muscles.\nSo you take those two factors,\nmultiply them together,\nand there's your VO2 max.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As you\nwere describing that,\nI imagine you getting\nto an fMRI machine\nand seeing that equation\nlighting up in your brain\nbecause clearly, it's\ncommitted to memory very well.\nThank you for that\nclear description.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nSo to finish those\nnumbers, I really, truly\nwant to see a man above 50--\nand I'm not even really\nstoked until I get above 55.\nIn fact, it's sort of funny.\nDave Costill, whose lab\nI did my PhD in-- he\nwas retired by the\ntime, but he's, again,\none of these legendary figures\nin exercise physiology,\nstarted in the '70s.\nHe would always say,\n\"There's no human excuse\nto be below 60,\" which\nI was always like, damn.\nThat's really, actually,\npretty hard to get to.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Was\nhe at 60 or above?\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah.\nhe's still, actually,\nsetting world records in\nthese last couple of years,\nall the Masters records for\nswimming and cycling and stuff.\nSo he was a super,\nsuper fit guy.\nSo he was always above 60.\nHe's probably like\n50 something now,\neven though he's 80 or whatever.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: 80 years old.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWith a VO2 max of 50.\nANDY GALPIN: He's\nprobably really not 50.\nHe's probably--\nbut he's probably\ngoing to-- remember\nearlier on we\ntalked about how I had\nthe 92-year-old who\nhad VO2 max of 38.\nDave's probably going to break\nthat record when he gets there,\nI'm sure.\nI'm sure.\nIn fact, I guarantee you he\nhas that number in his brain.\nI haven't talked\nto him in 15 years,\nbut I guarantee you that\nnumber is in his brain,\nand he's probably\ntraining for it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nAnd I love it because it\nproves that exercise pays off.\nANDY GALPIN: Oh, yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's one\nof the few things in life\nwhere there's a direct\nrelationship between work\nand outcome.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nAs Henry Rollins described\nin his wonderful essay,\nif you're familiar with that.\nOh my gosh, you're\na punk rock guy.\nYou know Henry, I'm sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I mean, I\ncertainly know who he is,\nand I know his work.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nHe has incredible\none-page paper.\nIt's something to\ndo with the iron.\nAnd he basically\ndescribes that as, this is\nthe one thing where it's truth.\nIt is the most true thing you'll\never do, which I love that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's almost\nlike a principle of nature.\nANDY GALPIN: 100%.\nYeah.\nSo with the women, I really\nwant to see the women--\nif I want to see men\nabove 55, I really\nwant to see women\nabove 50 as the target.\nAnd if you like, you're\nthere, I'm pretty good.\nSo you can do the math on, then,\nthe middle ground of what's\nlike OK, but we\nneed to work on it.\nIn fact, if you look\nacross the literature,\nat different\nathletes, you're going\nto see the really\nhigh-level endurance folks,\nthey may pass 70 or 80.\nIn fact, there was talk a few\nyears ago of a guy breaking 100\nas an 18 or 19-year-old,\nbut I actually\ndon't think it was ever\nfully confirmed or repeated,\nbut certainly, you'll\nsee plenty of people\n95, in those extremes.\nIf you look at other sports,\nlike football or basketball,\nthey're probably going to\nbe in the 55, 65 range.\nSo if you, as, an\naverage person are 55,\nthat's a really good\nmarker to be in.\nIf you get even close to\nthat, you're in a good spot.\nI'm sorry if I let\nyou down, Dave.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nI just love how you're\ndescribing this average person,\nyou're looking at me with\njust a little bit of sympathy,\nlike if you reach the\nstandard of average, Andrew.\nListen, you're giving me\nprompts all over the place\nto try and improve my metrics,\nwhatever they happen to be.\nAnd I think that's one of\nthe great values of getting\nobjective numbers, even if they\nhave to be measured by some\nof these back-of-the-envelope\ntechniques that, I guess,\nwe always teach people\nin the laboratory,\nthat a tool can be\nnot extremely precise,\nbut as long as it's reliable,\nthere is still value there.\nI mean, of course, you'd love to\nhave the most precise and most\nreliable tool, but\nif you can't, then\nat least go for a reliable tool\nand measure for consistency.\nANDY GALPIN: Yeah.\nFor the real world,\nreliability beats validity\nas much as we can.\nFor a lot of the things\nwe're talking about,\nespecially for using it as a\nmetric of did I get better, as\nlong as that tool is reliable.\nBody composition, just\nall of these things\nhave inherent error in them.\nSome of them are smaller,\nsome of them are larger,\nbut as you mentioned,\nhaving standardization\nwithin the testing\nprotocol is going to allow\nyou to measure progress.\nAnd that's going to tell\nyou sort of where you're at.\nNow that we've covered all\nthese areas of adaptation,\nwe walked through\nthe history, and we\nwalked through a bunch\nof the explanations\nfor why people are maybe not\ngetting the results that they\nwant to get through\ntheir training,\nthe way I would like to go with\nthe rest of our conversations\nwould be to just go through\neach of those adaptations step\nby step and make sure I cover\nvery specific protocols for,\nif you have run\nthrough this testing\nand identified an\narea of weakness.\nSo maybe you've been lifting a\nlot because you like lifting,\nand you maybe realize that\nyour cardiovascular fitness\nor your heart rate recovery is\nnot where it really should be\nor the opposite, like\nwe've talked about.\nMaybe you're doing a lot\nof that type of work,\nand your strength isn't there.\nYour movement\nquality is not there.\nSo you've identified a problem.\nHow do I specifically solve it?\nWhat are the evidence-based\nand most effective\nprotocols that I can put\nmyself
