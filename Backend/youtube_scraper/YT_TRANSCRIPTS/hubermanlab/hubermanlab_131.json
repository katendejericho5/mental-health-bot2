    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology,\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Rick Rubin.\nRick Rubin is\ncredited with being\none of the most creative\nand prolific music\nproducers of all time.\nThe range of artists with whom\nhe's worked with and discovered\nis absolutely\nstaggering, ranging\nfrom artists such as LL Cool\nJ, Public Enemy, Minor Threat,\nFugazi, Beastie Boys, Jesus\nand Mary Chain, Jay-Z, Red Hot\nChili Peppers, Metallica,\nGreen Day, Tom Petty, System\nof a Down, Joe Strummer, Kanye\nWest, Johnny Cash, Adele,\nand many, many more.\nNot surprisingly,\ntherefore, Rick\nis considered\nsomewhat of an enigma.\nThat is, people want to know\nhow it is that one individual is\nable to extract the best\ncreative artistry from so\nmany different people in so\nmany different genres of music.\nWell, as today's\ndiscussion reveals,\nRick's expertise in\nthe creative process\nextends well beyond music.\nIn fact, our\nconversation takes us\ninto the realm of what\nthe creative process is\nspecifically and generally\nacross domains, including\nmusic, of course, but also\nwriting, film, science,\nand essentially, all domains\nin which new, original thought,\nideas, and production of\nanything becomes important.\nOur conversation ventures\nfrom abstract themes,\nsuch as what is\ncreativity, and where\ndoes it stem from,\nto the more concrete,\neveryday, tool-based\napproaches to creativity,\nincluding those that\nRick himself uses\nand that he's seen other\npeople use to great success.\nThat took us down some\nincredible avenues,\nranging from a discussion\nabout the subconscious,\nto how the\nsubconscious interacts\nwith our conscious mind,\nand how the subconscious\nand conscious mind interact with\nnature around us and within us.\nIndeed, our conversation got\nrather scientific at times,\nbut all with an eye and an\near toward understanding\nthe practical tools\nthat any and all of us\ncan use in order to access\nthe creative process.\nWe also spent some time talking\nabout Rick's new book, which\nis all about creativity and\nways to access creativity.\nThe title of the book is The\nCreative Act: A Way of Being,\nby Rick Rubin.\nThis is a book\nthat I've now read\nthree times from cover\nto cover, and I'm now\nreading it a fourth time.\nBecause it is so rich with\nwisdom and information\nthat I'm applying in\nmultiple domains of my life,\nnot just my work but\nmy everyday life.\nI cannot recommend\nit highly enough.\nRick has an incredible ability\nto translate his understanding\nof the creative process in a way\nthat is meaningful for anybody.\nSo if you're in music,\nif you're a musician,\nit will certainly be\nmeaningful for you,\nbut it is not about music.\nIt is about the\ncreative process.\nAnd so whether or not you\nconsider yourself somebody\ncreative or not, or\nwhether or not you\nseek to be more creative, Rick's\nbook and today's conversation\nsheds light on what I believe\nto be the fundamental features\nof what makes us human beings.\nThat is what allows us,\nunlike other animals,\nto look out on the\nlandscape around us,\nto examine our inner\nlandscape, and to come up\nwith truly novel\nideas that thrill us,\nentertain us,\nentertain other people,\nscare us, make us\nlaugh, make us cry.\nAll the things\nthat make life rich\nare essentially contained\nin the creative process.\nAnd to be able to sit down\nand learn from the Rick Rubin\nhow the creative\nprocess emerges in him\nand his observations about how\nwe can best emerge in others\nis and was truly a gift.\nSo I'm excited to share his\nknowledge with you today.\nOne thing that\nyou'll quickly come\nto notice about\ntoday's conversation\nis that Rick is incredibly\ngenerous with his knowledge\nabout the creative process.\nIn fact, he very graciously,\nand spontaneously I\nshould add, offered to\nanswer your questions\nabout creativity.\nSo if you have questions about\nthe creative process for Rick,\nplease, put those in the\nComment section on YouTube.\nAnd in order to make those\nquestions a bit easier\nfor me to find, please, put\n\"Question for Rick Rubin\"\nin capitals, then colon or\ndash, whichever you choose,\nand then put your\nquestion there.\nI do ask that you keep the\nquestions relatively short,\nso that I can ask Rick as many\nof those questions as possible.\nWe will record\nthat conversation,\nand we will post it as a clip on\nthe Huberman Lab Clips channel.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Maui\nNui, which I can confidently\nsay is the most nutrient-dense\nand delicious red meat\navailable.\nMaui Nui spent nearly\na decade building\na USDA-certified,\nwild harvesting system\nto help balance invasive\ndeer populations\non the island of Maui.\nI've talked before\non this podcast,\nand we've had guests\non this podcast, that\nhave emphasized the critical\nrole of getting quality\nprotein, not just for muscle\nrepair and protein synthesis\nbut also for repair of all\ntissues, including brain\ntissue, on a day-to-day basis.\nAnd the general rule\nof thumb for that\nis 1 gram of quality protein,\nper pound of body weight,\nper day.\nWith Maui Nui meats, you can\naccomplish that very easily,\nand you can do that\nwithout ingesting\nan excess of calories,\nwhich is also\ncritical for immediate\nand long-term health.\nI should say, that\nMaui Nui he meets\nare not only extremely\nhigh quality,\nbut they are also delicious.\nI particularly like their\njerky, so their venison jerky.\nI also have had Maui Nui\nvenison in various recipes,\nincluding ground venison,\nsome venison steaks,\nand I love the taste\nof the venison.\nIt's lean, but it doesn't taste\noverly lean or dry at all.\nIt's incredibly delicious.\nSo if you'd

also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom\nnootropics, and as many of you\nhave probably heard me\nsay before, I am not\na fan of the word nootropics,\nbecause nootropics\nmeans smart drugs,\nand frankly, the brain\ndoesn't work that way.\nThe brain has neural\ncircuits for focus.\nIt also has neural circuits\nfor creativity and neural\ncircuits for task switching and\nfor imagination and for memory.\nThere is no such thing as a\nneural circuit for being smart,\nand therefore, the\nword nootropics\ndoesn't really apply\nto anything specific,\nneurobiologically speaking.\nThesis understands\nthis, and therefore,\nhas designed custom\nnootropics that are\ntailored to your unique needs.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor over a year now,\nand their nootropic\nformulas have\nbeen a game-changer\nfor me, in particular\nin the realm of cognitive work.\nMy go-to formula\nfor when I'm doing\nany kind of cognitive work\nis their clarity formula.\nThat's the one I've been\nusing most often, lately.\nIf you'd like to try Thesis\ncustomized nootropics,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nYou'll take a brief\nthree-minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAgain, that's\ntakethesis.com/huberman,\nand use the code Huberman at\ncheckout for 10% off your

real-time feedback\non how to adjust your training\nand sleep schedules in order\nto feel and perform better.\nSix months ago, I started\nworking with WHOOP\nas a member of their\nScientific Advisory Council,\nas a way to help WHOOP advance\ntheir mission of unlocking\nhuman performance.\nAnd as a WHOOP user,\nI've experienced\nfirsthand the health\nbenefits of their technology.\nIt's clear, based\non quality research,\nthat WHOOP can inform you\nhow well you're sleeping,\nhow to change your sleep habits,\nhow to change your activity\nhabits, even how to\nmodify different aspects\nof your nutrition, exercise,\nsleep, and lifestyle in order\nto maximize your\nmental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nSo whether or not\nyou're an athlete,\nor you're exercising\nsimply for health,\nWHOOP can really\nhelp you understand\nhow your body functions\nunder different conditions\nand how to really program\nyour schedule, nutrition,\nand exercise and many\nother factors of your life,\nin order to really optimize\nyour health and performance,\nincluding your cognition.\nIf you're interested\nin trying WHOOP,\nyou can go to join WHOOP--\nspelled W-H-O-O-P--\ndotcom slash

Momentous\nSupplements are\nof the very highest quality.\nThey ship internationally,\nand they have\nsingle-ingredient formulations.\nIf you'd like to access\nthe supplements discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou can go to Live Momentous,\nspelled O-U-S, so\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Rick Rubin.\nGreat to have you\nhere today, Rick.\nRICK RUBIN: Thank\nyou for having me.\nIt's a pleasure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So of\nall the topics in science,\nand in particular\nin neuroscience,\nI confess that creativity is the\nmost difficult one to capture.\nBecause you can find\npapers, scientific studies\nthat is, on convergent thinking\nversus divergent thinking,\nand there are\ndefinitions to these,\nand they take on\ndifferent forms.\nBut in a strict\ndefinition form, it\nseems that creativity\nhas something\nto do with either\nrearranging existing elements\nor coming up with new elements.\nBut as I went into your\nbook, which I've done twice.\nI've read it twice,\nand by the way,\nI feel so blessed\nand honored to have\ngotten an early copy from you,\nor a final copy early that is.\nBut having gone\nthrough it twice,\nI'm now convinced that\nthere may not actually\nbe an internal source\nof creativity that\nexists on its own right.\nAnd the example that you\ngive that, for me, really\nis serving as an anchor, and\ntell me if I'm wrong here,\nis this idea that\nideas and creativity\nare a little bit like a cloud.\nIf you look at it\nat one moment, you\nmight think that it looks\nlike one thing, where it has\na certain shape and texture.\nBut then you look at it a moment\nlater, it could be quite a bit\ndifferent.\nAnd if you look at\nit an hour later,\nit very well could be gone.\nAnd the reason I\nthink that serves\nas such a powerful hook for\nme to think about creativity\nand why I think neuroscientists\nand scientists in general\nhave never actually\ncaptured a way to even talk\nabout creativity\nstems from somebody\nthat you knew in person but,\nas you know, I greatly admire.\nI don't have many\nheroes, but I would\nput Joe Strummer among the short\nlist of heroes that I have.\nAnd I remember once an interview\nwith him fairly disjointed.\nHe was off in different\ntangents that I couldn't follow.\nBut at one point,\nhe just blurted out\nthat, if you have an idea,\nyou have to write it down.\nAnd you may end up throwing\nit away, but if you wait,\nit will be gone.\nAnd I remember that,\nand as a consequence,\nI have a whole system that I\nuse to try and capture ideas.\nBut what are your\nthoughts on what\nJoe said, this cloud\nidea that comes up in one\nform in one area of the book?\nBut then I think it's\nthread throughout the book\nin different ways.\nHow did that come\nto you, and how\ndoes it serve you in trying to--\nI don't want to say\nextract-- but trying\nto access creativity?\nRICK RUBIN: I think\nthe best way to think\nabout it is like a dream.\nIt's like, if you think\nabout your dreams,\nthey don't necessarily\nmake sense.\nWhen you wake up, you\nmight remember part but not\nthe whole thing.\nThen, if you start writing\nthem down, they'll come back,\nand they may not\nmake sense to you.\nThere'll be a series\nof abstract images,\nand maybe, someday\nin the future,\nyou'll be able to look back\nand understand what they mean,\nand maybe not.\nAnd that's how the art\nmaking process works\nis like we're making\nthings, and we're looking\nfor feeling in ourselves.\nAnd it could be a feeling\nof excitement or enthusiasm,\na feeling of interest,\na feeling of curiosity--\nI want to know more--\na feeling of leaning forward.\nAnd we're following that\nenergy in our body, when\nwe feel there's something here.\nThere's something here.\nI want to know more.\nI want to know more.\nI want to know more.\nI'll say, it's not an\nintellectual process.\nIt's a different thing.\nThat's why it's hard\neven to talk about it,\nbecause it's so elusive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRecently, I was listening\nto a podcast by our\nfriend Lex Fridman.\nI think it was an episode\nwith Balaji Srinivasan,\nwhere Balaji, who's\nan investor-type guy,\nthinker-type guy--\nthis is like an\neight-hour episode.\nHe says something\nat the beginning\nthat I'd love your thoughts on.\nHe said, look, we\ncan train a rat\nto lever press every\nother time or to expect\nreward on every\neven number press\nor every odd number press or\neven every fifth number press.\nBut a human and a\nrat can't do that\nfor like prime number presses.\nYou can't actually train that.\nAnd then you think about the\nreward systems and the way\nthat we follow life, from when\nwe get up until we go to sleep,\nand what he said is the fact\nthat we can't do that means\nthat we may not actually\nbe in touch with the best\nschedules of doing things.\nLike every time I'm\nthirsty, I take a sip.\nI assume that's the\nright way to do it,\nbut it might not be optimal,\nfor whatever purpose.\nWhen I was reading your book,\nI was thinking about there's\na set of things\nto follow, things\nto pay attention to-- you talk\nabout this-- things to access,\nthat none of the\ncreative process\ncomes from just within us.\nIt can, but it's always being\nfed by things outside of it.\nAnd so what I started to\ndo is, the second time\nI read through the book, was\nthink about it through the lens\nof what Balaji was saying\nwas that there may not even\nbe a language for\nthis thing that we\ncall accessing creativity.\nThere's a process, but that\nlanguage in the form of words\nis a little bit like trying\nto use even numbers to try\nand access prime numbers.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like the\nmath becomes so convoluted\nthat we end up in a\nconversation like this,\nwhere I'm confident we can\nget to the kernels of it.\nBecause what's remarkable\nabout the book is that you do.\nYou show and inform the process.\nBut there may not be a\nEnglish or any other language\nfor saying, do this, then\nthis, then this, then this,\nand you'll have something\nof creative value.\nDoes that capture it?\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nI think language is insufficient\nto drill down on creativity.\nIt's closer to magic\nthan it is science.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So when\nkids come into the world,\ndo you think that\nthey have better\naccess to this creative\nprocess than we do as adults?\nBecause we start to impart\nrule plays and books.\nLike will it get likes?\nWill people like it?\nBut also all the things\nthat are available to us\nthat we're not paying\nattention to, like the texture\nof this table, we're discarding\nthings, systematically.\nWe get, quote, unquote,\nset in our ways.\nDo you think kids are, just\nby definition and by design,\nmore creative than adults?\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nKids, they're open, and\nthey have no baggage.\nThey don't have\nany belief system.\nThey don't know how things\nare supposed to work.\nThey just see what is, and if\nwe pay attention to what is,\nwe learn much more than if we--\nMost of us select from an\nendless number of data points\navailable to us to,\nwell, as a species,\nto make sure that we\ndon't die and to procreate\nand to feed ourselves\nare probably\nthe primary functions first.\nAnd then we learn things about\nwhat's right and what's wrong,\nand we learn things about\nhow to do certain things.\nOr we're inspired by someone\nwho makes something we love,\nand we want to do it\nthe way they do it.\nAnd all of those things\nundermine the purity\nof the creative process.\nThey can be tools to\nbuild your skill set\nto be able to do it yourself.\nLike if you're a\nsinger, you might\nimitate a singer you really like\nfor a while to get good at it\nand then eventually come\nto find your own voice.\nIt doesn't always start\nwith your own voice.\nBut if you're three years\nold or five years old,\nand you try singing, you're\nnot singing like anyone else.\nYou're singing with\nyour own voice.\nAnd when you make\nsomething, you're\nmaking it based on not knowing.\nAnd I think I had the\nadvantage, early in my career,\nof starting making music\nwithout any experience, which\nwas helpful, because I didn't\nknow what rules I was breaking.\nAnd so it wasn't intentional\nbreaking of rules.\nI just did what\nseemed right to me,\nbut I didn't realize\nthat I was doing things\nthat other people wouldn't do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThere is this idea\nthat there are no new ideas.\nI disagree, because\nevery once in a while,\nI'll see or hear something\nthat at least seems\ndifferent enough.\nRICK RUBIN: I think\nit's a combination of--\na new combination of existing\nideas presented in a new way.\nI think that's how it works.\nI don't know.\nBut I will say, it does\nseem like the things that\nare most interesting to me have\na series of familiar elements\njoined together in a way\nthat it's creating something\nthat I've never seen before.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned\nthat when you are close to\nor you see hints of creativity\nthat is of real value\nthat it's a feeling, and I\nalso believe that the body is\na great source of information.\nWhich once people will realize\nthat the brain, of course,\nis in the skull, but the nervous\nsystem extends everywhere\nin the body, the whole\nmind-body thing just falls away.\nPhilosophers have argued\nabout this forever,\nbut it's a silly argument.\nIt's also true\nthat, God forbid, I\nwere to amputate all my\nlimbs, have them amputated,\nI'd fundamentally still be me.\nRight?\nThe same is not\ntrue if we took out\na big enough chunk of my\nbrain, and I still survived.\nI would be a fundamentally\ndifferent human being.\nI'd still have the same name\nand identity and social security\nnumber, but I would\nbehave very differently.\nWho knows, maybe better?\nThe signals from the body we\nknow, or at least we assume,\nare pretty generic.\nLike I can think of 50\ndifferent ways or 100 ways\nthat we could talk\nabout creativity today.\nAnd we could define it and\nredefine it and carve it up\nand serve it up like sushi\nin a bunch of different ways.\nBut the body sends signals\nthat most of us are--\nwe have a course\nunderstanding of.\nIt's like, oh, my stomach\nhurts, or my stomach feels good,\nor I'm not sensing my stomach.\nOr oh, that feels good.\nIt feels warm.\nIt feels cold.\nLike most of us aren't\ntrained in understanding\nhow to interpret those signals.\nSo it's almost like you have\na few vowels, a few syllables,\nand there isn't a lot more.\nWhereas, we talk about our\nthoughts and our experiences,\ndepending on how hyper\nverbal somebody is\nand how much emphasis they\nput on different sounds,\nit's near infinite.\nNot infinite, but near infinite.\nSo for you personally,\nwhen you know\nthat you're on the end of\na thread of creativity--\nmaybe you're listening\nto an artist,\nor you're hearing something.\nAnd you're like there\nand the your antennae\nstart to deflect\nin a certain way.\nRight?\nDo you feel that in your body\nas a recognizable sensation,\nor is it a thought\nand a sensation?\nRICK RUBIN: It's a\nfeeling in my body.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs it localized?\nRICK RUBIN: No.\nIt's a feeling of--\nI would say it's like\na surge of energy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\nremember the first time\nyou experienced that?\nRICK RUBIN: Probably\nhearing the Beatles, when\nI was three or four years old.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Three\nor four years old?\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there\nsomething wrong with me\nthat the Beatles have\nnever done it for me?\nRICK RUBIN: No.\nMaybe you just weren't\nexposed at the right time\nin the right way.\nThere's no right or\nwrong way, and everyone--\nI can love the Beatles, and you\ncan not, and we're both right.\nThere's not--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad\nwe can still be friends.\nI was a little concerned.\nI was a little scared to\nask you that question.\nI know my taste in\nmusic is a little bit\nobscure and\nfragmentary, but good.\nI've always felt\nlike, gosh, there\nmust be something wrong with me.\nI like their songs,\nbut they don't--\nthere's no juice for me there.\nRICK RUBIN: I think\nmaybe we'll watch--\nthere was an eight-part series\ncalled The Beatles Anthology,\nwhich is out of print.\nBut I can try to\nfind it somewhere,\nand we can watch that\ntogether, and maybe that'll\nmake the case for the Beatles.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nNothing against them, it's\njust I'm always bothering you\nfor a story, but like Ramones.\nI saw that, and I was like,\nwow, like jeans, aviators,\neveryone had to\nchange their last name\nto Ramone, a lot of\nthem hated each other.\nThere's so much drama in\nthere, and three chords\nand just-- but to me,\nit just was like, wow,\nlike kids from New\nYork, that energy.\nSo I think different things\nfor different people.\nRight?\nRICK RUBIN: Absolutely.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo that brings me\nto a question of when something\nfeels creatively right,\nand you're sensing\nit, and you're there,\nlet's say in the studio\nor maybe even you're\nlistening to something\nthat somebody sent you,\nhow do you translate that,\ngiven the absence of language?\nHow do you translate that into\na conversation with the artist?\nAnd again, this could be about\nwriting or comedy or science\nor podcasting, for that matter.\nHow do you say that,\nkeep going that way,\nwhen they might not even\nrecognize that they did it?\nAnd I'm guessing a lot\nof times, they don't.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nSometimes, they don't.\nIt depends.\nWhen we're in the--\nI'll try to be in\na setting where,\nas we're talking\nabout it, we can\nengage with it in that moment.\nSo it's not much good.\nLet's say I was producing\nyour new record,\nand you played me something, and\nI had some thoughts about it.\nIt wouldn't be so helpful for\nme to tell you what those were.\nIt'd be better for us to\nwait till we were in a place\nwhere we could try things\nand see where it goes.\nSo the first thing is I wouldn't\nrely on language to do it.\nIt would be more of making a\nsuggestion of something that's\nactionable.\nWe try it, and then\nwe have more data.\nAnd either we're moving\nin a good direction,\nor we're moving away from--\nwe're moving towards it or away\nfrom it, and we never know.\nAnd so it's always\nan experiment.\nAnd maybe a simple way to\ntalk about it would be like,\nif I gave you two\ndishes of food and asked\nyou to taste them and tell\nme which one you like better.\nUsually, it's pretty\nstraightforward,\nwhen you have two choices,\nwhich you like better,\nand I think most creativity\ncan be boiled down to that.\nThat's very different\nthan I wonder\nhow this is going to perform on\ncertain social media platforms?\nThat's different\nthan what is it--\nwhen I'm tasting these two\nthings, which is the one I\nwant to finish eating?\nAnd if I were to say,\nI like this one better,\nbut it needs a little salt, and\nthen put a little salt on it.\nIt's like, maybe I\nput too much salt,\nand you know when you taste it.\nIt's like it's that simple.\nBeing in tune enough\nwith ourselves\nto really know how we feel\nin the face of knowing\nthat other people might\nfeel very differently,\nwhich is part of the challenge.\nIt's like, if everyone\ntells you A, A, A, A, A, A,\nand you listen, and you're\nlike that's B, as an artist,\nit's important to be able\nto say, to me, it's B.\nAnd it's a disconnect,\nbecause so much of,\nwhen we go to school, it's to\nget us to follow the rules.\nAnd in art, it's different,\nbecause the rules are there\nas a scaffolding to be\nchipped away, as need be.\nSometimes, they're helpful.\nSometimes, they're not,\nand sometimes, we'll\neven impose our own rules\nto give something its shape.\nSo we can decide to make a--\nwe're going to make a\npainting, but we're only\ngoing to use green and\nred are the only colors\nwe're allowed to use.\nWe decide that in\nadvance, and then how\ndo we solve the problem knowing\nall we have is green and red?\nIt can-- because\notherwise, if there's\nan infinite number of choices,\nanything can be anything.\nIt's like, sometimes more\nchoices is not better.\nSo limiting your palate\nto something manageable\nforces you to solve\nproblems in a different way.\nNow, in our digital\nage music-wise,\nyou can make anything digitally.\nThere's no-- there\nwas a time when,\nif you didn't have a\nguitar in the studio,\nyou couldn't record guitar.\nOr if you couldn't\nhire an orchestra,\nthere couldn't be orchestra\non your recording.\nNow, you can just call\nany of those things up.\nSo there's infinite choices,\nand infinite choices\ndon't necessarily lead to\nbetter compositions or better\nfinal works.\nUnderstanding how you feel\nin the face of other voices,\nwithout second\nguessing yourself,\nis probably the single\nmost important thing\nto practice as an artist.\nOr a skill set to develop as\nan artist is to I know how you\nfeel, and own your feelings.\nAnd the key to\nthat is not I know,\nso I know what's right for you.\nIt doesn't work that way.\nIt's just I know for me, and the\nreason I chose to be an artist\nis to demonstrate\nthis is how I see it.\nIf I'm undermining my taste\nfor some commercial idea,\nit defeats the whole\npurpose of doing this.\nThat's not what this\nprocess is about.\nThis process is I'm doing me,\nand I'm showing you who I am.\nAnd you can like it or\nnot, but either way, this\nis still how I see it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love\nthat, because in science,\nhaving trained graduate\nstudents, having been\na graduate student,\nI was very blessed\nto have mentors, one of\nwho is a real iconoclast.\nHe's dead now.\nActually, all my\nadvisors are dead--\nsuicide, cancer, cancer.\nThe joke is you don't\nwant me to work for you.\nSo they all had a\nmorbid sense of humor,\nso they're laughing about\nthis, someplace, right now.\nRICK RUBIN: I thought you\nwere going to say they\nall ate the poison mushrooms.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No, but\nthe last one said to me,\nyou're the common\ndenominator, Andrew.\nAnd I thought, oh\nmy goodness, and he\nsaid, kind of just\nkidding, but not really.\nSo it's a little bit eerie.\nBut in any case,\nhe always said--\nhis name was Ben--\nhe always said,\nthe one thing I\ncan't teach is taste,\nand the one predictor I\nhave of the people who\nwill never develop it are the\nones who are perfectionists.\nBecause they're\nfiltering their--\nperfectionists that\nfilter their perfection\nthrough the feedback of others.\nHe was always looking\nfor the person\nthat was putting up a little bit\nof a middle finger to feedback.\nNot so much that they\nwould get things wrong,\nbecause it can be\nbadly wrong in science.\nYou can be wrong for\nthe right reasons,\nbut you can also be wrong\nfor the wrong reasons.\nBut people that just had almost\na compulsion to do it their way\nor to believe in\nwhat they were doing.\nAnd I'm hearing some\nof that, or I'm hearing\nthat in what you're describing.\nI also think that\nthere's something\nabout the human empathic process\nor the emotional process,\nwhere when we see\nsomebody doing something\nand they seem to really\nnot be paying attention\nto what anyone else is doing--\nI guess the crazy person on the\nstreet is one version of it,\nwhere we go they're just\nin their experience,\nand it's just crazy.\nBut when somebody seems\nto be enjoying themselves\nor the emotion\nseems to be real, I\nthink there are a good\nfraction of people\nwho feel a gravitational\npull, and they go, yeah, that.\nAnd the best example\nI have of this\nis I remember growing up\nin the skateboard thing\nwe were the first-- we were the\nfirst to start doing the baggy,\nsagging clothes thing, and\nwe got teased endlessly\none year in school.\nThen, there was a bunch\nof hip hop that came out,\nand guys were wearing sagging\ntheir jeans or their shorts.\nNext year, we come back,\nand the very same people\nwho were making fun of\nus we're all doing it,\nand that's when\nit clicked for me.\nI was like, most people don't\nactually know what they like.\nRICK RUBIN: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey like what they\nlike because of the certainty\nof the people that they like.\nAnd so the question then\nis, in this landscape\nof creative stuff, what's real?\nWhat's not real?\nIt's almost like\nwhoever can create\nthe most convincing\nstory at least\ncaptures a good number of--\na good fraction of\naudiences, but that's\nnot what the creative\nartist needs to do.\nThey need to actually\ndepart from that.\nDo I have that right?\nRICK RUBIN: Well they're\njust two different things.\nLike coming up with a story\nwith the purpose of pleasing\nsomeone else is a\nskill set, but it's\nmore of a commercial endeavor\nthan an artistic endeavor.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's like tactical.\nYeah.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I was\nthinking, in your book,\nyou describe, again,\nwhen you're thinking\nabout the creative\nprocess as a cloud,\nfor me, again, it serves\nas such a powerful anchor.\nAnd then I think about the\nbiology, the neurobiology,\nof like strategy\nformation or strategy\nimplementation and then\nalmost by sheer luck,\nor miraculously, I turn a few\npages later into the book,\nand there's a description of\nhow animals that are trying\nto accomplish something--\neat, mate, find\nwater, accomplish\nthe requirements of living--\nit requires a\nnarrow visual focus.\nThis is something my\nlab is obsessed with,\nand I've been obsessed with.\nAnd in that more\nnarrow visual focus,\nwe know that the playbook\nbecomes more narrow.\nThe rule set is more narrow.\nNow, at some point,\nin order to come up\nwith a new creative\nidea, that means\nthat broadening vision is\nessential, in some way,\nor broadening thinking.\nRICK RUBIN: Well,\nit could either\nbe a broadening or a narrowing,\nbut it's changing the aperture\nfrom the standard.\nThe reason we do this\nis to present something\nnew that maybe you already knew\nbut didn't know you knew it.\nAnd for that to be the case,\nyou have to be looking at it.\nIt's not unlike what\na comedian does.\nComedian makes you laugh.\nUsually, what they're\nsaying, it's outrageous,\nbut you know that it's right.\nJust no one says it\nthat way, or no one\nhas said it that way before.\nBut it's always the truth\nin it that makes it funny.\nIt's like that.\nIt's the same idea as\nrecognizing something\nthat seems really\nobvious, once you see it,\nbut it seems like nobody else\nsees it, or no one else points\nit out.\nAnd I feel like science\nis like that too,\nbecause how much of science,\nonce the light flashes\nover your head, it's like I\ngot it, it just seems like,\nwell, we knew that forever.\nNo one knew it, but do\nyou know what I'm saying?\nIt's like it's so obvious.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.\nRICK RUBIN: It's so obvious.\nAnd I think another\nsuperpower of artists\nis this accepting we\ndon't know anything.\nWhen we think we know things,\nthat also limits our world.\nWe think we know\nit's only like this.\nThis is all that's possible,\nwhere nice in this little box.\nBut in reality, who's\nto say that's the case?\nWho's to say any\nof the-- we could\ntake all of what we\nbelieve in science now\nand decide to throw all of that\naway and start from scratch.\nAnd we'd probably create\na whole different one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand acknowledge our\nsponsor, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains\ndigestive enzymes\nand adaptogens.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nSo that's 10 years\nnow of taking Athletic\nGreens every single day.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring this podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens,\nis that it covers all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nSo whether or not\nI'm eating well\nor enough or not, I'm sure that\nI'm covering all of my needs\nfor vitamins,\nminerals, probiotics,\nadaptogens to combat stress,\nand the digestive enzymes really\nhelp my digestion.\nI just feel much better when\nI'm drinking Athletic Greens.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand for the month of January,\nthey have a special offer,\nwhere they'll give you\n10 free travel packs,\nplus a year's supply\nof vitamin D3 K2.\nVitamin D3 and K2 are\nvital for immune function,\nmetabolic function,\nhormone health,\nbut also calcium regulation\nand heart health.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim their special offer,\nin the month of January,\nof 10 free travel packs, plus\na year supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nIn an offline\nconversation one time,\nyou asked a good\nfriend of mine, who's\nbeen a guest on this\npodcast, Eddie Chang, who's\nchair of neurosurgery,\nand I would place him\nin the top 1% of\nneuroscientists.\nHe's pulling speech\nout of people\nwho are completely paralyzed\nwith locked-in syndrome,\net cetera.\nAnd you asked him, what\npercentage of what's\ncontained in medical\ntextbooks and training--\nRICK RUBIN: Today\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Today.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nIf you went to\nmedical school today,\nand you learned what was\nin the textbook, what\npercentage of that\ninformation is accurate,\nand what percentage is not?\nAnd he said, maybe half.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nRight, and you asked,\nand what is the\nconsequence of that?\nAnd he said, incalculable,\nand I completely agree.\nAnd I asked him a second\ntime, and he still\ncame up with the same answer.\nSo that's a good sign.\nReliability from experiment\nto the next is good.\nYeah.\nI think that there is this idea\nthat we really know things.\nIn science, we've observed\namazing discoveries\nfrom chance.\nWe've observed\namazing discoveries\nfrom incredible\nbouts of hard work.\nIn both cases,\npeople were spending\na lot of time in the lab.\nLike no one walked into the\nlab, saw something one day,\nand had a Nobel Prize\nwinning discovery\nor fundamental discovery.\nThey were all hanging\nout in lab a lot.\nJust some of them\ncame up with something\nthat they didn't expect.\nOthers were drilling\ntoward an answer.\nRICK RUBIN: And in\nall those cases,\nwhen the breakthroughs happen--\nI'm guessing.\nI don't know this--\nthat considering we\nassume this information,\nthen this discovery is\ntrue, based on everything\nthat came before it.\nBut if everything that\ncame before it is wrong,\nthen the discoveries are\nprobably built on a--\ndo you know what I'm saying?\nIt's like the context,\neverything that happens\ntakes into account that the\ncontext that it's sitting in it\nfits in that context.\nMaybe that context isn't right.\nWho knows?\nWe don't know.\nSo I'm saying, we're too close\nto most things in thinking,\nwhen we think we things,\nwhere there are a lot\nof assumptions that go into it.\nAnd that any new\ndiscoveries are essentially\nbuilt on top of these\nbeliefs, but they're beliefs.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I remember--\nof course, I listened to\nthe Beastie Boys growing up.\nWho didn't?\nI was a child of the 90s,\nand they were in the--\nSabotage was an outgrowth\nof a skateboarding movie,\nlike Spike Jones and\nlike the girl movies.\nAnd those worlds, the Beastie\nBoys and skateboarding\nwere really closely\ninterwoven for a while.\nSome people know that.\nSome people don't.\nAnd Spike formed the\nbridge, and then Spike\nwent off and started\nmaking more bigger movies\nthat more people watch.\nBut let's just use\nthem as an example.\nI heard you say once before that\nyou guys were joking around,\nlike Beastie Boys, like\nthese guys doing hip hop,\nbut it was kind of like\nthe hardcore scene,\nin New York, punk rock\nscene, and it was a joke.\nThere were a lot\nof inside jokes.\nWhen you were working\ntogether, was there the thought\nthat people might love\nit, might hate it,\nor you just weren't\npaying attention at all?\nRICK RUBIN: Weren't\npaying attention at all.\nNever considered it.\nThere were no-- at\nthat point in time,\nwhen we were making\nLicensed to Ill,\nhip hop music was a\ntiny underground thing.\nAnd no one making\nhip hop at that time\nthought it would\never mean anything.\nIt was not a realistic thought.\nSo we were making it really\nfor our crazy friends,\nand that's it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So do\nyou think, nowadays,\nthe fact that one can create\nsomething and, quote, unquote,\nrelease it quickly.\nI can put something out onto\nTwitter or Instagram now.\nWe could do it in\n10 seconds from now,\nand I will get immediate\nfeedback, which\nis external feedback,\nof course, but then I\ncan iterate on the\nbasis of that feedback.\nDo you think that's\nproblematic for the larger\nopportunity for creativity?\nIn other words, if we were to go\nback 20 years or even 15 years,\nwhen the opportunity to create\nwas certainly still there,\nbut you really didn't know how\nit was going to land until you,\nquote, unquote, released it.\nIt seems to me there\nwas more opportunity\nto stay in that\nmagical rainforest that\nis the creativity itself.\nRICK RUBIN: I don't think\nit's wrong or right.\nIt's just more information that\nyou can use or not use and use\nit in a useful way.\nAnd you can make\nsomething and put it out,\nand people could not like it.\nAnd you're like, oh,\nthey still don't get it.\nI'm going to I got to go harder.\nLike I got to go harder\nin that direction not--\ndo you know what I'm saying?\nIt's like not to react\naway from information.\nIt can be helpful.\nIt can be helpful when--\nthere could be different stories\nthat happen at the same time.\nWhere you're making something,\nand you have an idea of what\nit is.\nAnd then other people\nengage with it,\nand they have a different\nidea of what it is.\nAnd they like it for\na different reason\nthan you did or\ndislike it for a reason\ndifferent than the\nreason you like it.\nWe can't control\nany of those things.\nThe only part of it\nthat we can control\nis how we relate to\nthe thing that we make.\nAnd any external\ninformation that\nundermines the clarity\nof that connection\nis probably bad for\nthe art is my guess.\nAnd again, I'm only saying\nthis from my experience.\nI try to make things--\nall I've ever tried to\nmake was something I like\nor something that I felt\nlike was missing as a fan\nthat I wanted, and\nnobody was making it.\nSo I'll make it, but it wasn't--\nit was always in the service\nof I love this thing.\nI want something like this.\nNo one else is making one.\nI have to make one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nIt's beautiful, because the\nword that keeps coming to mind\nis it's almost\nlike a compulsion.\nLike there are other\noptions of ways\nto be and to behave and to\nfunction and work in life.\nBut if something\nis a compulsion,\nit yanks us away from\nthose other opportunities,\njust enough that we\nhave to get back to it.\nYou've talked before\nabout, and you\ntalk in the book, this\nnotion of the source.\nAnd to me, again, I can't help\nbut put my neuroscientist lens\non this.\nI think of the source as not\none brain area but some function\nwithin the brain,\nwhere we are in touch\nwith our bodily signals.\nLike what feels\nright, what doesn't?\nOr like tasting the two\nfoods, I love that example.\nAnd that it's a playbook\nthat is far more\nvast than the short\nterm adaptive playbook,\nlike this how I'm going to\nget from point A to point B.\nAnd yet, when I listen\nto an album or a song,\nI have to assume that\nthere, at some point,\nit becomes not strategy\ndevelopment or creativity\nbut strategy implementation.\nLike there needs\nto be the songs are\ngoing to come in\nthis order-- and I\ndon't know much about music.\nMy musician friends\nare always laughing.\nRICK RUBIN: It's not\nso much about music.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Right.\nWell put, but the\nordering of the sequence\nof the melodies, et cetera.\nSo at what point\ndoes one decide, OK,\nlike now's the time\nto get into that more\nnarrow focus of effort?\nLike we've got it.\nLet's run with this.\nBecause there is a component\nof the creative process\nthat involves packaging\nand finishing.\nAnd is that part less\nsatisfying to you,\nor is it just all part\nof the same larger arc?\nRICK RUBIN: It's all\npart of the same.\nIt's nice.\nThere's a good feeling.\nThere's usually a good feeling\nwhen something is done.\nOn the one hand,\nit's a commitment,\nbecause up until the time\nthat you say it's done,\nyou can keep experimenting\nand changing it.\nIf you think, well, maybe\ntomorrow I can make it better,\nthen it's not finished.\nAnd you keep thinking\nthat for a long time,\nyou can do that forever\nand never put out anything.\nSo getting to the point where\nyou're ready to sign off\nis a good feeling,\nand it allows you--\none of the things I talk about\nin the book is, because it\nis a difficult thing to do,\nbecause it's fun to play,\nand it's fun to maybe it's\nnot the best it could be yet.\nTo use whatever\nthe next project is\ngoing to be as motivation\nto finish the one\nyou're working on now.\nLike I'm working on this.\nI'm spending all of\nmy time on this thing.\nIt's really good.\nI believe it can be better,\nbut there's this other thing\nthat I really want to make.\nAnd if I keep tinkering\nwith this one,\nI'll never get to\nmake the other one.\nSo using other\nprojects as an impetus\nto finish something and\nrelease it into the world\nis a good one.\nAnd you said your description of\nsource is something within us.\nI don't know if I would\nsay that was accurate.\nIt's definitely in us too,\nbut it's not only in us.\nAnd it's I think of\nsource as the organizing\nprinciple of everything, and\nit's how everything exists.\nHow the trees grow, and\nwhy there are mountains.\nAnd anything that we can\nsee in the outside world,\nand every discovery\nand every piece of art\nand every new design\nand every machine\nare all outgrowths of\nthis source energy.\nOur part of it is the\nantenna that connects to it,\nand maybe where the\nvehicle for source\nto allow things to\nhappen in the world.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthank you for that,\nbecause I did indeed misspeak.\nBecause I recall very\ndistinctly in the book,\nyou described how\nthe physical world\nis constrained by the laws of\nphysics and certain things.\nThe imagination\nis unconstrained.\nAnd I think I have\nthis right, that you\nsaid the work set\nsomewhere between those,\nit's neither of\none nor the other.\nThat ultimately what\nfeeds into all of that\nare imagination and\nthe way, indeed,\nthat our brain is\na physical entity.\nThe nature in the\noutside world provides\nat least what appears\nto be near infinite\nif not infinite options.\nAnd I love the example\nof the color palette.\nThat if we restrict\nme to whatever\nsorts of paints or medium I\nhave, then it's restricted.\nBut in nature, there's\nan infinite number\nof shades and tones\nand combinations.\nRICK RUBIN: And even on\none, if you pick up a rock\nand look at the\ncolor of the rock\nand tried to find a\npaint to match that rock,\nit would never match.\nThere's too much.\nThere are too many\nvariations in nature\nwithin a single color\nrock for us to get close.\nThere's too much information.\nWe scratch the surface.\nWe're only scratching\nthe surface.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd we love when\nwe are able to peer in\nat different scales,\nspatial scales, time scales too,\nbut spatial scales, the delight\nthat comes from that that\nthese nature pictures-- seemed\nlike there were more\nof these in the '80s,\nlike where you'd see\na drop of oil shot\nat very high resolution.\nThere's beauty in a drop of oil.\nAnd then you'd see the\nEarth and the galaxy,\nthere's beauty in that\ntoo, these extremes.\nAnd of course, our\ndaily perception\nis mostly through the filter\nof these kinds of interactions,\nwalls, and sometimes outdoors.\nThere's a brilliant\nneuroscientist,\nand not surprisingly,\nhe has a Nobel.\nHis name is Richard Axel.\nHe's at Columbia University.\nHe's outrageous personality.\nChews Nicorette nonstop.\nYou guys would get along great,\nnot because of the Nicorette,\nbut because his\nperspective on things\nis very abstract for\na guy who's solved--\nhe won the Nobel for\nsolving a great problem\nwithin how we smell,\nperception of odors and tastes.\nAnd he says that everything\nthat the brain does\nis an abstraction.\nLike I could take a\nphotograph of your face\nand show it to you, and\nyou'd say, yeah, that's me.\nOr let's say for the moment, I\ncall myself an abstract artist.\nLet's just play a game,\nbecause I've never been\naccused of being an artist.\nAnd I do three dots\nand a squiggly line,\nand I say that's you.\nAnd you say, well, that doesn't\nlook like me, and I say,\nbut that's my\nabstraction of you.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nWell, the brain essentially\ndoes that, because\nor something in between that.\nBecause there's no actual\nphotograph of you in my brain.\nIt's just a bunch\nof neurons playing\nwhat we call an ensemble, like\na different keys on a piano.\nAnd we go, Rick, I\nrecognize you, Rick Rubin.\nAnd so everything\nis an abstraction,\nand it's only once we start\ntinkering with the parts--\nand this is the\nessence of science,\nto remove and add\nand manipulate.\nAnd the best example I can\ncome up with would be Rothko.\nAnd I only we come\nup with this example\nbecause I started off in\nvision science and maybe\nthis will make the\nmost sense to everyone,\nexcept the folks who've\nbeen blind since birth,\nand they can swap\nsomething in here.\nThat if I show you a Rothko, and\nI don't tell you it's a Rothko,\nyou may or may not actually\nthink it's that impressive.\nIt depends on your taste in art.\nBut what Rothko did,\nwhich was amazing,\neven if you don't like Rothkos--\nand I happened to--\nis that he removed all the\nwhite and high contrast-y stuff.\nAnd when you do that\nyou alter color space,\nand so the colors\nlook very different.\nSome people saw that\ndress a few years ago,\nis it orange, or is\na gold or whatever?\nThat was a little bit\nof the same phenomenon.\nI doubt-- in fact, I'd be\nwilling to bet my left arm\nthat Rothko knew nothing about\nthe neuroscience of color\nperception.\nBut somehow got to\nthis place where,\nif there was no canvas\nshowing and no high contrast\nand the paintings\nwere large enough\nand on the appropriate\nwall, you saw them\na certain way that tapped\ninto something fundamental.\nAnd this is where I think art\nand science really converge,\nis that, every once in a\nwhile, we see something that\nfeels amazing to\nenough people-- and not\njust like the baggy\npants phenomenon,\nnot just because other\npeople think it's cool.\nBut there's something there,\nand again this defies language.\nAnd I have to imagine that in\nyour years of life and music\nand other creative endeavors,\nthat every once in a while,\nhave you ever\nencountered something\nwhere something\nfundamental keeps\nshowing up in different form?\nOr there's something like almost\nlike a rule or a principle,\ndoes that ever come about?\nBecause in science,\nwe think of this\nas like this is reveals\nsomething about our limitation\nto abstract the world.\nI hope I made that clear.\nRICK RUBIN: Not, exactly\nbut I have a thought.\nYou talked earlier\nabout the drop\nof oil, the photograph\nof the drop of oil\nand the photograph-- or we\ncould use, on the other side,\nlike Hubble telescope\nimages of these vast things\nin high definition.\nWhat we see every day is as\nimpressive as those things,\nbut where numb to them, because\nwe see them all the time.\nAnd if we were to look\nat drops of oil every day\nin a microscope,\na month from now,\nwe would not find\nwonder in that image.\nSo sometimes, it's the\nnovelty of not seeing it\nfrom that perspective before\nthat's really thrilling.\nAnd I could imagine,\nand this probably\nrelates to the Rothko idea,\nthat you could see something\nfrom a particular angle and\nhave this magical experience.\nAnd then walk three\nfeet to the side\nand see it from a different\nway, and it just evaporates.\nIt only works-- it only triggers\nthis thing in us when we\nlook at it just the right way.\nThere was an experiment\nI just heard about,\nheard about the other day,\nthat sounds fascinating,\nthat a painting\nteacher recommended.\nWhere instead of painting--\nhaving a model in\nthe room and painting\nthe model, that you have\nthe model in the next room.\nAnd you go into the next\nroom without your equipment.\nYou don't have your equipment,\nand you can study the model\nfor as long as you want.\nAnd then you go into\na different room,\nwhere you can't see\nthe model, and paint\nthe model, instead of--\nand it changes\nyour relationship.\nWe're not just\npainting the lines.\nWe're painting what\nis interesting enough\nabout what I saw--\nwhat are the data points\nthat stuck in my mind?\nAnd when I string those\ntogether, what do I get?\nAnd what do I--\nhow do I form it to get\nas close to whatever\nthe experience of\nthat person was, which\nthe closest of getting\nto the experience\nof that person in the\npainting might not\nlook like a photograph.\nIt might look more\ndifferent then more the same\nto really see what you see.\nIf we think about the\nPicasso paintings that\nwere inspired by African\nart, where the eyes are\non different levels, they\nmay give us more information\nthan a photograph would give us.\nI'm thinking about when\nyou were describing\nthe sensation of when something\ntakes your breath away,\nand we all have that when\nwe see a dramatic sunset.\nAnyone you know, when there's\na really dramatic sunset,\nor if there's a whale, and\nif anyone's on the beach,\nand there's a whale,\neverybody's really interested\nthat there's a whale.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nThese feelings of wonder,\nwe get to experience them,\ndepending on where we are.\nOr a dragonfly or a bird\nflies into your space,\nthese things happen.\nAnd when they happen,\nit's like we're\nconfronted with the\nmystery of the world, when\nwe change the perspective.\nNormally, we don't think of\nwhales in our backyard or birds\nin our house, flying\nfreely, but they\ndo happen. these\nthings do happen,\nand they like break\nus out of our trance\nwhen these things happen.\nIt's like, oh, yeah, there are\nbirds like this everywhere.\nI'm just not paying attention.\nThis guy is coming in to\ntap me on the shoulder.\nIt's like remember me?\nHere I am.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I would\nsay that the whale example\nand what you're describing\nis it's revealing to us how--\nin a delightful\nway-- how deficient\nour perceptual\nfilters normally are.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's a little bit\nlike the Rothko\nis revealing how--\nI've never thought about it\nthis way until this moment--\nis revealing to us how\ncolor normally looks\nis actually, first of all,\nnot the only way it looks.\nThose colors we think are\none way, but all of color--\nthis gets into the\nbiology of color vision--\nis all about contrast.\nWhat something is next to\ndictates what it looks like,\nand that's the origin\nof that dress meme\nor whatever you call it.\nI still can't figure out\nexactly what a meme is.\nSomeone will eventually tell me.\nIn the same way, when you see\na whale, and it's delightful,\nI think it's revealing\nto us the extent to which\nthose whales are--\nthe ocean is vast.\nThere's a whole universe\nthere, and we are blind to it\nall the time.\nAnd I think the misperception--\nor the misconception,\nexcuse me, is that we're\ndelighted because we\nsee the whale.\nWe might be just as\ndelighted because we're\ngetting hit with the\ncontrast of how little\nwe recognize all the\ntime, and in that way,\nit reminds me a little\nbit about comedy.\nAnd I've been watching\nmore comedy lately,\nand sometimes, it's the shock.\nSometimes, it's the absolute\ntruth that's revealed,\nand then other times,\nwhat I've noticed--\nand I saw Rogen do comedy\nat the Vulcan Club,\nin Austin, which he does\nevery once in a while.\nAnd it was small club, and\nhe was leading out this story\nduring his routine\nor bit, I think.\nRight?\nThis bit, and everyone\nknew where it was going.\nWe all knew, and then\nwhen he finally told us,\nit was exactly where we\nthought it was going,\nand it was hilarious.\nRICK RUBIN: And it felt good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd it felt amazing,\nand I thought in that moment,\nI was like, wait a second,\nhow did he pull that off?\nThat was masterful, because\nnormally, it's this thing\nlike you create one story.\nThere's like a scripting out,\nalmost like a courtroom lawyer.\nAnd then they kind\nof pull the curtain,\nand it's something different.\nAnd if you look at the science,\nthe neuroscience, and brain\nimaging of laughter\nand humor, which\nI've looked into, to be\nhonest, and no disrespect\nto the people in that\nfield, it's pretty lame.\nIt's lame, because\nit's always the jarring\nnature of a surprise.\nBut what he led us to was\nsomething that, oh, no,\nhe's actually going there.\nOh, wait, he's\nreally going there,\nand it was this anticipation\nwith a beautiful delivery\nat the end.\nAnd so I'm convinced\nthat, based on what\nwe're talking about here, that\nthere's something about when we\nsee something, we\nthink it's about that,\nbut that the\ndelight that we feel\ncould be about the other\nexperiences that now become,\nin a subconscious way, like ha.\nIt's almost like laughing\nat this perceptual deficit\nthat we have.\nIt's almost like laughing at\nhow little we actually know,\nwhich is what you've said.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nIt could be that.\nIt also could be the\nsense of community\nof when you think it's going\nto go a particular way,\nand it goes that way.\nIt's like reinforcement of you.\nIt's like, yeah, he's\nsaying it, but in a way,\nwe're saying it together.\nI'm listening, he's saying it,\nbut we're in this together,\nand that's a good feeling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I have to\nthink about that for a second.\nI was trying to think about why\ncertain music still can evoke\nsuch powerful emotions in me.\nAnd there does seem to\nbe something special\nabout the music we listen\nto when we are teenagers.\nFrom about 14 until\nabout 25, it seems\nto get routed into our\nnervous system in some way.\nMaybe because that\nphase of our life\nis really one of\nidentity crisis.\nYou don't find too many\n40-year-olds, some,\nwho are wondering\nlike who they are.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Occasionally,\nbut almost every young teenager\nor pre-teen and\nis like who am I?\nYou're defining personality.\nSo I always likened it to that.\nBut leaving out the\ncritical period biology\nstuff, what do you think\nit is about the music\nthat we hear at that time?\nAre that much more\nemotionally tuned?\nHave we not shut down our\nsensors quite as much?\nBecause the songs\nand the artists\ndon't matter, because they're\nvery individual to me.\nFor other people, it will\nbe the Beatles or something.\nNow, I just really wish the\nBeatles did it for me too.\nBut do you think\nthat's important?\nBecause I could see how\nit's really terrific.\nI could also see\nhow it sets up one\nof these what I'll\njust use nerdy language\nand call like a\nsemi-deprived filter.\nBecause if I'm only\nlooking for the way\nthat a Stiff Little\nFingers track made\nme feel the first time I\nlistened to it, when I was 15,\nthe feeling is worthwhile.\nBut if I'm looking for that,\nI'm missing all the other stuff.\nI'm missing the Beatles.\nI'm missing Fleetwood Mac, which\nnever did it for me either.\nI'm like, I'm missing all\nthis stuff that people I love\nand respect really love.\nSo I've never worried\nabout it, because there's\nan infinite treasure trove of\nother things that I do love.\nBut I do sometimes\nwonder whether or not\nmy life experience\nis diminished,\nbecause I'm not allowing range.\nAnd you've, obviously,\nworked in a huge number\nof different genres of music.\nPunk is one thing.\nHip hop is--\nNeil Diamond too.\nRight?\nEminem too, Slayer too, right?\nAnd in some sense,\nas I list these off,\njust think about how much in\nhigh school, maybe nowadays\nless so, but even in\ncollege and as an adult,\nsocietally, were asked\nto constrain ourselves\nto one of these groups.\nI didn't know it was\nOK to love Bob Dylan\nand love punk rock\nas much as I do,\nuntil I heard Tim Armstrong\nsaid he loved Bob Dylan.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd I was like--\nand recently, he told me\nhe loves the Grateful Dead,\nand I was like, whoa.\nBut I remember when\nyou had to pick.\nRICK RUBIN: Both the Ramones\nand the Clash love the Beatles,\nso we can--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nI got work to do.\nRICK RUBIN: We'll\ndo it together.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nRICK RUBIN: I have\na feeling part of it\nis, the reason it gets\nin at that age, is it's\na time when we're\ndefining who we are,\nand the music is part\nof the definition\nof how we see ourselves.\nLike the music that we hear\nbefore that might be the music\nthat's on the radio or our\nparents' music or our older\nbrother or sister's music.\nAnd then when you're\n14 or 15, and you\nstart choosing what\nyou're listening to,\nit's like, now\nit's finally mine.\nAnd my parents\nmight not like it,\nand my older brothers and\nsisters may or may not like it,\nbut this one is mine.\nAnd it always has\nthat impression in us\nthat this is ours.\nMy that's my thought of\nwhy it continues to last.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: How do you\nwipe the slate clean then?\nSo for instance, if you're going\nto go in and work with somebody\nnew-- and again, as\npeople are hearing this,\nI hope that they're\ntransplanting this\nto whatever it is that they do.\nBecause in the realm of\nscience and podcasting\nand communication,\nit's not music,\nbut there's a contour and a way.\nHopefully, this podcast\nwill look nothing\nlike it does in five years.\nThat's my hope, is it will\nstill have the core features\nof the beauty and utility\nof biology coming through,\nbut I hope it doesn't look\nanything like episode two.\nRICK RUBIN: And I think\nit'll evolve as you evolve.\nIt's just, the truer it\nis to what interests you,\nand if you're not\ninterested in biology\nin the same way in five years,\nI would hope it's not the same.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'll be doing\npsychoanalysis in real time\nhere.\nIn therapy, we'll all be\nlying down on couches.\nRICK RUBIN: Whatever it is.\nWhatever it is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWe probably won't\nbe on psychedelics,\nbut we might be levitating.\nYou never know.\nI'd like to take a brief\nbreak and thank our sponsor\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood\nwork done, for the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that\nimpact your immediate\nand long term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a\nlot of blood and DNA\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic\nfactors-- lipids and hormones\nand so forth--\nbut you don't know\nwhat to do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation-based\ninterventions\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors-- hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and long\nterm health-- to bring\nthose numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate\nand indeed optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to try\nInsideTracker you can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nand get 20% off any\nof InsideTracker's plans.\nThat's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nSo how do you--\nlet's talk a little\nbit, if you would,\nbecause I know I'm very\ninterested in your process.\nI'll spare you the\ndaily routine question.\nIt's very cliche.\nBut you and I are both lovers of\nsunlight, of horizons, and not\nas a trivial source, as\nan amazing gift of energy.\nRight?\nAnd there aren't\nwords for it really.\nAside from your\ndaily routines, when\nit comes to somebody you're\ngoing from project to project,\nand you know you're going to\nbe doing work with somebody,\ncould be your own work.\nAnd we'll talk about\nthe writing of this book\nand its structure\nwhich is very unique.\nI've never encountered a book\nwith this kind of structure\nbefore, and it's the\nmost facile read ever,\nand yet every single page,\nI underlined, took notes,\nstarred.\nAnd like, as you notice, it's\nvery worn, very, very worn\nalready and only\nmore so over time.\nDo you have a\nprocess for removing\nthe functions of the day and\nwhat you were doing last week\nand what's going on in order\nto get more access to this--\nI'm going to think of it\nnow more as a receiver\ninside of you.\nRight?\nAlmost like tuning a radio,\n[IMITATING STATIC] and then\nit comes in.\nLike the beginning of like\na Strummer Clash thing.\nRight?\nHe love the radio.\nJoe loved the radio, right?\n[IMITATING STATIC] and\nthen it comes in clear,\nand there it is.\nHow do you clear the static?\nWhat are some of the\noperational steps\nthat you think might be more\ngeneralizable, regardless\nof where somebody in Africa\nis listening to this.\nRICK RUBIN: I would say, when I\nengage in a particular project,\nwhatever it is, I\ndedicate all of myself\nfor that period of\ntime, whatever it is.\nWhether it be 20\nminutes or whether it\nbe five hours,\nwhatever it is, total\nfocus, and no outside\ndistraction whatsoever.\nAnd when I leave that\nprocess, I do my best\nnot to think about it,\nwhen I'm away from it.\nI don't bring any\nmaterials with me.\nI don't leave the studio\nwith works in progress\nand spend time listening\nto them during the day\nor looking for ideas.\nI stay as far away from\nit, when I'm not directly\nengaging in it, as possible.\nAnd in the best of situations,\nI have something else to totally\nengage myself in in between.\nSo instead of working on\nproject A for five hours,\nand then leaving\nand doing nothing,\nI'm hoping to engage\nin a Project B\nor B, C, and D\nwith all of myself\nbefore going back to\nproject A again, which might\nbe the next day, let's say.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So this\nrelates to an amazing chapter\nand series of\nwritings in your book,\nthat I'm not going to describe,\nbecause I want people to find\nit for themselves,\nabout disengaging,\nabout disengaging\nfrom the process.\nOne question I had as\nI read that chapter,\nand as you're saying this\nnow, is even though you're\ndisengaged, do you believe that\nyour subconscious is working it\nthrough?\nRICK RUBIN: I believe so.\nI believe so, and\nI think in general,\nto stew over a problem is not\nthe way to solve a problem.\nI think to hold the\nproblems lightly--\nand when I say a problem,\nwhen we're starting a project,\nthere's usually\nthis feeling of--\nthere's a question mark, at\nthe beginning of every project.\nI'm always anxious when\nI start a new project,\nbecause I have no idea\nwhat's going to happen.\nI never know.\nI never-- I may have, in some\ncases, a potential backup plan,\nif nothing works, but I really\ntry not even to have that.\nI prefer not to have that.\nI prefer to go in maybe\nto calm myself down enough\nto be able to show up,\nthere'll be an idea of,\nif nothing works, maybe we\ncould try something like this.\nBut that would only\nbe for my own anxiety.\nIt wouldn't be for\nactual practical use.\nBut there's always a sense\nof anxiety, because I know,\nwhatever's going to happen is\ncompletely out of my control.\nSomething either interesting\nor not will appear,\nand then we're going to\nfollow that wherever it goes.\nAnd until something\nappears for us to follow,\nI have a lot of anxiety, even\nthough it has never not come.\nIt has come every time, but\nthere's something about it--\nbecause I also feel like there\nmight be expectation on me\nthat I'm going to\nmake it happen,\nand I know that's not happening.\nThat's not how it works.\nI show up ready for\nit to happen and am\nopen to whatever we have to\ndo to find that first thread.\nAnd once we find the\nthread, then it's like, OK,\nwe have a-- and that thread\nmay lead us to anything.\nIt could lead us in a\nmillion different directions.\nBut something about having\nthat glimmer, that we're not\nlooking at a blank page.\nWe're looking at, OK, we have\nthe beginnings of, I would say,\na map.\nBut it's a map that we don't\nknow where it takes us,\nand it's just the beginning.\nIt's just like, you are here.\nIf you have a map, and\nit says you are here,\neven if you can't\nsee the directions,\nknowing where we are feels OK.\nAnd once we get--\nand usually, again,\nusually in the first day, first\ncouple of days, it happens.\nBut up until then, it's really\nan anxiety-producing situation,\nand then I can't remember\nthe original question.\nSo that was the beginning of\nsomething completely different.\nBut do you remember\nwhat you asked?\nI don't remember.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWell, we were talking\nabout disengaging,\nand is your\nsubconscious into it?\nAnd then we're talking\nabout, I love this.\nSo like what is your process\nof wading into this thing?\nAnd you're revealing that now.\nI think of anxiety as readiness.\nI think about the characteristic\nfeatures of anxiety,\nit tends to be a bit\nof a constriction\nof the visual field into\nmore of a narrow vision.\nBut that's appropriate,\nbecause you\nwant to shed what's\ngoing on elsewhere.\nAnd then even when people\ntalk about the shakes or this\nlike not feeling\nOK sitting still,\nanxiety was designed to mobilize\nus and not always to run away.\nRarely do I talk about the\nwork in my own laboratory,\nbut one of the things that--\nfrankly, I didn't discover but\nit was done in my laboratory\nbut is brilliant.\nGraduate student Lindsey\nSalay, who's now at Caltech,\nwas that we can often\nobserve animals or humans\nin very high states of\nanxiety, as they move forward\ntoward a goal.\nAnd we always think of moving\nforward as like this calm\nthing, these heroes, Rosa Parks\ntelling people like F you.\nLike I'm not getting\noff the back.\nI'm not leaving the--\ngiving up my seat on\nthe bus or Muhammad Ali.\nI bet you they were\nexperiencing tremendous anxiety,\nbut it was in the forward tilt.\nAnd so I think anxiety\nis at least comfortable\nwhen we are forcing\nourselves to stand still.\nSo it's a activating\nenergy, and that\nbrings up a word\nthat I have written\nin my notebook as an\nextraction of a lot of themes\nfrom within the book that you\nand I have talked about before,\nwhich is--\nand here I'm going to\nsound very West Coast woo.\nBut I mean it as\nseriously as it can\nbe stated, that I feel like\neverything is energetic.\nWe can do things from\na place of anger.\nWe can do things\nfrom a place of joy.\nWe can do things from\na place of delight.\nI like to think\nmaturing into the idea\nthat joy and delight and love\nis the ultimate reservoir\nof energy.\nBut a lot of the music that I\nlike from when I was younger\nwas because of\nthe anger that was\nthread into it or the sadness.\nRICK RUBIN: If you think of\nyour relationship to that music,\nit's a relationship of love.\nYou didn't listen to\nthat to get angry.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nRICK RUBIN: You listened\nto it because you loved it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nI felt loved by it,\nbecause it matched\nwhere I was at the time.\nRICK RUBIN: It was true to who\nyou were and where you were.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I know\nthat collaboration,\nthere's a wonderful\nchapter on collaboration,\nbut it's collaboration,\nas you mentioned before,\nwith the universe,\nnot with others.\nBut in terms of the, especially\nthe kind of work that you've\ndone and do, when it comes\nto working with artists,\nI do wonder--\nand here I'm not looking\nfor any gossip or stories.\nI've never been\ninterested in gossip.\nI love stories, but I'm\nnot interested in gossip.\nBut once you see that\nthread dangling there,\nand you're going\nto go after this.\nOr you grab on to it,\nand you're like, OK,\nnow you have a\nlittle bit of a map\nand an orientation\nwithin that map.\nI often wonder, scientists\nare complicated people.\nPeople think\nthey're very boring,\nbut they're actually\nvery complicated.\nBecause they're\noften living in one\nlimited rule set of\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nThat's how you get\ngood at getting\ndegrees is by understanding\nthe rules of academia\nand playing by those rules.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: People\ntinker with the rules.\nYou get your Richard\nAxels who are\nvery playful in how\nthey go about it,\nbut they are systematic.\nHe's known for\nrigor, rigor, rigor.\nRight?\nWhen I think of creative\nartists and musical artists,\nI think of a bit\nmore zany or loose.\nOr you watch the documentary\nabout the Ramones,\nand you're like, wow,\nthere's all this chaos.\nHow-- because so many of\nthe brilliant artists,\nmusical artists\nthat are out there,\nseem to have some\nchaos inside them,\nor their lives aren't always\nstructured, oftentimes.\nAnd science too,\nby the way, there\nare substance abuse issues\nand personal life issues.\nHow-- since you don't\nhave 100% control,\nthey need to play the\ninstruments, sing, et cetera.\nHow do you work with\npeople who have it in them\nbut are getting\nin their own way?\nRight?\nAnd do you think that\nthe internal chaos\nthat a lot of\nartists seem to have,\ndo you think that\nsometimes is actually\nan essential piece of\nthe creativity picture,\nthat you can't disentangle it?\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nI don't think it's an essential\npiece in general, but certain\nartists, that's how they do it.\nI would say, I rarely get to\nsee the chaotic part of artists.\nFor whatever reason, they\nrarely show it to me,\nand most of them, like\nmost comedians I know,\nare much more serious\nabout what they're\ndoing than what it looks like\nfrom if you see them on stage.\nThere's much more\nto it, and there's\nmuch more focus on craft\ngoing on and digging deep\nthan would necessarily be\nobvious seeing them jump around\non stage.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm a fan\nof boxing, track and field\nand boxing, the sports\nnobody really cares about,\nnow that UFC is so popular.\nAnd track and field is--\nit's a little bit\nlike wrestling.\nWhen you go, the\npeople that are there\nare there because\nthey really love it.\nWe'll talk about\nwrestling in a little bit,\nprofessional wrestling.\nBut Floyd Mayweather\nis obviously\na colorful character\nand one of the best\nrecords in boxing of all time.\nAnd a few years back, I got\ninto watching his stuff,\nand what one sees is\nthe cars and the money.\nThey literally call\nthemselves the money\nteam, and the\nspending, and there's\nall the outrageous stuff.\nBut I know someone who was in\ncamp with him who actually was\na sparring partner for\nhim, and the lore has it--\nthey have very closed door\nsparring or clean ups.\nBut the lore is\nthat he would do--\nbecause nowadays, it's\n12, three-minute rounds\nwith a minute in\nbetween, used to be 15.\nBut now, neuroscientists\nstepped in,\nand it turns out a\nlot of the deaths\nwere occurring when it\nwas more than 12 rounds.\nFor whatever reason,\ncut off at 12\nreally seemed to\ntruncate the deaths.\nThere are other things too.\nIf the dad is\napparently a cornerman--\nwe have someone else\nhere at the podcast who\nknows more about this than me.\nRICK RUBIN: That's fascinating.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nThe kid not wanting to\ndisappoint the parent\ncorrelated with death.\nI'll get some of this wrong,\nand they can come after me.\nBut in any case, this guy\nwho was in Floyd's camp\nsaid that he would\ndo 30 to 60 minutes\nof sparring, bringing in fresh\nsparring partners with no rest.\nThat he would run three or\nfour times per 24 hour cycle,\ndespite all the\ncritical need for sleep.\nThat his training was\nunbelievably intense,\nto the point where he\nwould just chew out,\nchew up, and destroy\nall training partners.\nAnd yet the perception that we\nsee is it's playful for him.\nSo it sounds very similar.\nLike what we see is often\nnot what goes into it,\nthat people are\nintensely rigorous.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah, and\nI think, in a way,\nfrom a psychological\nperspective,\nif you knew you were fighting\nsomeone who wasn't taking it\nseriously, that would\ngive you some confidence,\nand that would not\nbe a good thing,\nif the person was actually\nworking really hard,\noutworking you.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nLike from a psychological\nperspective,\nthat makes sense to me.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So what\nI keep coming back to\nis that I'm imagining\nin my mind you\nhave to ends of the continuum.\nOne that is about fairly narrow\nfocus, training, training,\nstrategy implementation,\ncultivating craft, building\ncraft, and then the\nother side is the cloud.\nIt's very nebulous.\nRight?\nAnd there's this\nword that I learned\nfrom a colleague of mine, when I\nwas down at the Salk Institute,\nwhen my lab was there,\nbecause he studies this.\nThere's this phenomenon that\nI don't want to mispronounce,\nbecause then it sounds\nlike something else.\nBut the correct\npronunciation is pareidolia,\nand pareidolia is our tendency\nto look at an amorphous shape,\nlike a cloud or\na tree, and think\nthat it looks like something\nelse, an ice cream cone.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe man in the moon.\nRICK RUBIN: Yep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nthat again reveals\nthe extent to which the brain\nwants to place symbolic filters\non things, and we need this.\nRight?\nBecause I see you walk\nin the door, and Rick,\nI recognize you.\nIn fact, we have a brain\narea, called the fusiform\nface gyrus, that it literally\nis a face recognition area.\nAnd you could be\nat any orientation,\nor I could just see your\neyes and know that it's you.\nThere's a phenomenon\ncalled propasognosia,\nwhere people can see faces.\nThey can describe\neverything in the face,\nbut they don't know,\nfor instance, that it's\nJFK or Madonna or Lex Fridman.\nRICK RUBIN: It's quite the list.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Quite the\nlist, there you go, Lex.\nRun for office, Lex.\nJust kidding.\nIt's hard enough to get you to\nrespond to my texts as it is.\nSo we have these filters, and\nso we're taking this cloud,\nand we're deciding\nwhat things are.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nwhat I want to go drill\ninto your process a little\nbit more deeply, when\nyou approach a project--\nso everyone meets each\nother, shakes hands.\nHere are the engineers.\nWe're going to sit down.\nEveryone knows what\nthey're doing, because you\nwork with professionals.\nAnd you start going, are you\ntrying to be with the cloud\nor in the implementation?\nLike where are you\nin that continuum?\nAnd forgive me if I'm like\ntrying to surgically go\ninto your process in a way that\nwould disrupt it in any way.\nBut I trust you been\ndoing this for a while,\nand there's no threat of that.\nRICK RUBIN: I'm in the cloud,\nwith the exception of I'm\naware of what could go wrong on\na technical side, and I might--\nlike if something\ngood is happening,\nI might look over and make\nsure that we're rolling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that's a\nleap over to here, momentarily,\nbut then you get back.\nRICK RUBIN: Maybe.\nMaybe.\nIf I feel like--\nif I was in the moment,\nI would be in the cloud.\nAnd if something good\nstarts happening,\nit would trigger\nsomething in me.\nLike uh-oh, I hope this is--\nI hope we're really doing\nthis, because I don't know\nif we could ever do this again.\nThat would be a thought of--\nwhen the first time\nthe real world would\ncome into the picture would be\nsomething good is happening.\nLet's not lose it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And when\nthat happens, do you--\nnever been in a studio\nbesides a podcast studio.\nDo you say, hey, guys,\nthat sounded good.\nMore of that.\nOr do you wait, you\nlet them continue?\nBecause obviously you don't\nwant to break their flow.\nRICK RUBIN: We'd never\nwant to break any flow,\nonce it's happening.\nYeah.\nOnce something's happening,\njust sit back and watch.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And do you\nthink there's resonance,\nlike the team of\nengineers and other people\nknow when \"It,\" quote,\nunquote, is happening?\nRICK RUBIN: If everyone's\npaying attention, yes.\nWhen everyone's\npaying attention,\nit's usually pretty obvious.\nSometimes, the thread\nwill be something\ndifferent than expected,\nand maybe not everybody\nwould pick up on it.\nAnd that might be\na particular-- that\nmight be particular based on\nmy taste or an artist's taste.\nOr someone involvement might\nsay, let's listen back to that.\nI think that was\nbetter than we thought.\nThat can happen.\nYou said several\nthings, and it was\nlike you said enough for there\nto be several conversations.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI tend to do that.\nSorry.\nEspecially with you.\nI don't get to see you nearly\nas often as I would like,\nand so when I do,\nI confess that I'm\na little bit of a\nkid in a candy shop.\nRICK RUBIN: I wrote down\nthe brain tells us stories.\nSo you talked about, I walk\nin, certain data points,\nyou recognize me, but it's a\nreal like looking at a cloud\nshorthand.\nWe go through our lives\ndoing this all day\nwith everything we see, and the\nshort hand, in the case of me,\nyou know me, the shorthand\nturns out to be right.\nIt checks out.\nIf it's something we\ndon't know and something\nwe're not familiar\nwith, something happens,\nwe experience something\non the street.\nSomething happens, and\nit doesn't make sense.\nSomething out of the\nordinary happens.\nThe first thing is this\ndoesn't make sense.\nThen, what we do is, again,\nsubconscious, unconsciously--\nI don't know if it's\nunconscious or subconsciously--\nwithout thinking, we create a\nstory that explains what just\nhappened, a hypothetical that\nmakes it OK that what just\nhappened happened.\nAnd oh, maybe he's running\nbecause his dog ran away,\nand he's chasing his dog.\nMaybe that's why he's running.\nAnd as soon as we have that\nthought of what it might be,\nwe relax, because now it's\nnot just a guy running,\nand this is weird.\nBut it's a guy running, oh, he's\nprobably running after his dog.\nAnd now, we register that\nstory that we just made up,\nwithout even knowing we were\nmaking it up, as what happened.\nAnd then later in the\nday, if someone says,\nyeah, did you see that guy\nrunning out of the house?\nIt's like, yeah, he\nwas chasing his dog.\nI saw that.\nAnd you won't even\nrealize that it was maybe\nhypothetical story that was the\nfirst possible explanation that\nallowed you to continue walking.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nThat's our whole lives.\nOur whole lives are\nreacting to things,\nmaking up a story\nof what we think\nmay have happened,\nwithout realizing\nthat's what we're doing.\nAnd then living the rest of\nour lives as if that thing\nthat we made up really\nhappened, and we never know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ncompletely agree.\nWe confabulate from\nbirth until death.\nThere's this\nwell-observed phenomenon\nin people who have\nmemory deficits.\nSo there's the sad\nexample of this and then\nthere's the everyday\ntypical not--\nwho knows-- sad or\nnot sad example.\nSo for instance, if somebody\nhas a slight memory deficit,\nor someone has\nAlzheimer's dementia,\nthey'll find themselves in\nthe hallway at night and say,\nwhat are you doing here?\nAnd they'll say, oh, I was\ngoing to get a glass of water,\nbut they're walking away\nfrom the direction that\nwould make sense.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: People who--\nalcoholics who drink\nenough develop something\ncalled Korsakoff syndrome,\nwhere a certain brain\narea gets messed up.\nAnd you'll ask them\na question, like oh,\nwhat are you doing here?\nAnd they will come up\nwith incredible stories,\nsometimes interesting\nstories, that\nhave no bearing on reality.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You ask\nthem who their name is--\nRICK RUBIN: But do they believe?\nThey believe that's\nwhat happened.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: With\n100% certainty, and this\nactually relates to a\nlot of the now better\nunderstood controversy\naround repressed memories.\nYou can, especially\nfrom young people,\nyou can pull memories from them\nof things that never happened.\nThis has been demonstrated\nover and over again.\nSo courtrooms know to\nbe very cautious now\nabout this whole notion\nof repressed memories.\nRICK RUBIN: That's good to know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nvery, very complicated area\nof the law, as you can imagine.\nBecause we tend to\nwant to trust victims,\nfor understandable reasons.\nBut in terms of\naccuracy of details,\ntwo people have very\ndifferent accounts\nof the same experiences,\nand this has\nbeen shown over and over again.\nThat you can do well\nin the laboratory.\nIt's pretty interesting.\nSo again, because\nof this selective\nfiltering and\nstorytelling, and we are--\nI think it was\nSalman Rushdie, who\nsaid we are the\nstorytelling species.\nHe probably--\nRICK RUBIN: Wow.\nI was going to say we're\nstorytelling machines,\nbut that's great.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nWe are story--\nI would say that\nthe big five, if I\nhad to pick up a brain function,\nis we are very limited filters.\nThe mantis shrimp sees 67\nshades of red for every one\nthat we see.\nSo they have access to things\nwe don't have access to.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThey're not, as far\nas I releasing, albums of the\nRed Hot Chili Peppers caliber,\nbut who knows.\nMaybe down there they are.\nI did see something, by the way\nas a relevant tangent recently,\nand I don't know if it's--\nlook, even if it's\ncrazy, it's super cool.\nIf you take a device\nthat amplifies\nthe electrical signals\ncoming from cactus,\nand you just translate that\ninto a simple rule of conversion\nto two or three\npitches of sound,\nthe music that comes out of\nit is beautiful, nothing short\nof beautiful.\nAnd when I saw that, the\nteenager in me thought,\nyou know when we\nhear whale song,\nwe think it's so beautiful.\nLike what if they're just\nlike cursing at each other\nthe whole time?\nRight?\nMaybe they're in there\nlike a Rogen episode,\nwhen he invites all his\ncomedian friends in there.\nWho knows?\nMaybe it's a\npsychoanalytic conversation\nabout their childhood traumas.\nI don't know.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But we decide,\nwhale song is beautiful.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We decide\ncactus are just plants.\nRICK RUBIN: And it's\nbeautiful to us,\nand we're right, that\nit is beautiful to us.\nBut it doesn't mean we\nknow anything about it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: That's right.\nYeah.\nSo we have these filters,\nperceptual filters.\nWe only can see and hear,\nsmell and taste what we can,\nand then the brain likes\nto work in symbols.\nWe tend to like to match\nthat person whose shoes are\nmessed up must be homeless.\nI've had a couple\nof instances in life\nwhere I saw what I thought\nwas a homeless vagrant\ninside a building at an\nacademic institution.\nIt turned out, it was the\nmost accomplished person\nin the field.\nThat's always cool.\nYes, that happened at Berkeley.\nThen, the other thing that we\ndo is we tend to put symbol--\nso we said perception, symbol\nrepresentations, and then\nour memories are\nentirely confabulated,\nbased on already deficient\nsymbol and perceptual\nrepresentation.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And so I\nnever liked the statement\nthat we don't know\nhow the brain works.\nI think we do know\nhow the brain works,\nbut that it works through\nvery limited filters.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So knowing\nthat and accepting it,\nand it seems to me that this\nidea of looking to nature,\nlooking outside\nus, is so critical.\nAnd in fact, I hope you\nwon't mind me sharing this,\nbut a few years back, I had\nsent you something by text.\nAnd I was kind of in\ndisbelief about something\nI had seen in the media.\nI was like, they\ngot it all wrong.\nAnd I knew the person\ninvolved, and it was not\na good situation for them.\nAnd I was like, they got it\nall wrong, and you wrote back.\nYou said, it's all lies.\nBack to nature, the only truth.\nRICK RUBIN: Wow.\nThat's wild.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nI wrote that down.\nI put it over my desk.\nRICK RUBIN: Wow.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I still--\nI'd tattoo it on my forehead,\nif I didn't already have\nit well-committed to memory.\nBut I know that's true.\nRight?\nNature we can look at and it's--\nRICK RUBIN: When I\nsay it's all lies,\nyou just talked\nabout our ability\nto how limited our facility to\nsee and understand what we see.\nYes?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yes.\nRICK RUBIN: So based on\nthat, that leads us to we\ncan't know much.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nOur resolution is\nso low on everything\nthat we're really just like\nwe're grasping at straws.\nWe have no idea.\nWe have no idea, and there's\ngreat power and knowing that.\nBecause if you think you know\nwhat's going on, chances are,\nyou're being deceived.\nNot because somebody\nis deceiving you,\nbut because they're\ntelling you what\nthey see, and they don't know.\nIt's all-- do you\nknow what I'm saying?\nIt's all made up.\nEverything we know is made up.\nMaybe, maybe it's true.\nThis brings us to pro wrestling.\nIt's the reason\nthat pro wrestling\nis closer to reality than\nanything else we can watch\nor any other content.\nIt's we know it's made up.\nWe know that it's a performance.\nIt's storytelling, and\nthat's how everything\nis, except we think wrestling\nis fake, and the world is real.\nWrestling's real,\nand the world's fake.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\ntalk about in the book--\nwe're definitely going\nin this direction.\nIn the book, you talk about\nthis notion of entertaining\nthe idea of the\nopposite being true.\nAnd there are not only\nemerging but established fields\nof psychology that are\nmaking great ground, I think,\ninto the human psyche, Byron\nKatie's work and others.\nWhere you take a\nstatement, and you start\nplaying with that statement.\nYou poke at its authenticity.\nAnd when I first heard that,\nI thought, this is hokey.\nRight?\nIt's just words.\nAnd then I realized\nhow foolish I\nwas being, because she's\nreally on to something.\nAnd there are others too,\nof course, but in science,\nthat's exactly what you do.\nYou don't really ask\nquestions in science.\nYou are forced to raise\nhypotheses and try\nand say true or false.\nNow, there are limitations\nto that approach, certainly.\nPure observational\nstudies have been\nincredible in terms of\nwhat they've revealed\nto us, especially in medicine.\nA patient that has a bullet\nhole through a certain area\nof the brain, you don't\ngo in and say, oh, I\nhypothesize that person will\nhave a deficit in seeing faces.\nNo.\nThe person wandered into\nthe clinic, and they go,\nthis person sees faces but\ncan't make sense of them.\nAnd then you reverse--\nyou forensically arrive\nat an understanding.\nSo but in general, we go\nabout things in this way,\nand considering that the\nopposite might be true, well,\nthat's a little bit, I suppose,\nof like seeing the whale\nat the surface of the water.\nIt's like, well, the\nopposite of my experience,\nwhich is all above\nwater, for the most part,\nis maybe not the complete\nexperience of life.\nYou start seeing the\ninverse all the time.\nSo I want to--\nRICK RUBIN: Consider the\ninverse all the time,\nand it really relates to the way\nthat you described how we see\ncolors is based on contrast.\nSo maybe blue is only blue\nin relation to yellow.\nSo if blue is our choice, if\nwe're not considering yellow,\nblue doesn't exist.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Absolutely.\nRICK RUBIN: It's like,\nwe talk about night.\nIt's only night,\nbecause there's day.\nIf there was no day,\nthere is no night.\nIn all of our cases,\nit's like the yin yang.\nThere's the light and\nthe shadow always.\nThere's always another\nside for everything,\nand we focus on one aspect.\nBut if we look at the\nother aspect, chances are,\nwe'll learn something too.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe nervous system\nis not just able to do this.\nIt's the way it does everything.\nTwo experiments I'll\njust briefly describe.\nMy scientific\ngreat grandparents,\nDavid Hubel, Torsten\nWiesel, showed\nthat, if you force a\nperson to look at something\nfor a long period of time\nwithout moving their eyes--\nthere's a way that you can do\nthis-- the image disappears.\nBecause normally, your eyes\nare making little microsecods,\nand you're comparing\nwhat you're seeing\nto what's right next to it.\nPixel by pixel, pixel by\npixel, pixel by pixel.\nRICK RUBIN: Wow.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWe don't even have\nto use the example of\npressing on the arm.\nWe're sitting in\nchairs right now,\nand until I said you\nknow what's going on\nat the level of sensation\non the backs of your thighs,\nyou were unaware of it.\nBecause if you experience a\npressure or a smell in a room,\nyou ever walk in the smell\nis either good or not good,\npretty soon, the\nsmell disappears.\nThe neurons are still firing\nlike sledgehammers on a bell,\nbut we become blind\nand deaf to it.\nBecause the nervous\nsystem likes to habituate\nthe value of that signal\nwhen it's there often,\nand it's only the stuff\nthat comes through\nsignal the noise\nthat kind of jolts us\ninto attention and awareness.\nAnd I want to return to\nattention awareness, which are\nprominent themes in the book.\nAnd I think, in an\nimportant way, not just,\noh, attention\nawareness is important,\nbut you also give insight into\nhow to pay better attention,\nhow to pay awareness\nwith the understanding\nthat people are going to\ngo about it differently,\nbut I do want to ask\nyou about wrestling.\nBecause when I was growing up,\nI lived South of the Cow Palace,\nand there was some\nwrestling going on there.\nI think back then it was WWF.\nThere was a short\nstint in my childhood\nwhere I paid attention\nto, in particular,\nwas it Koko B. Ware, the\nguy that had a Macaw?\nI was obsessed with tropical\nbirds, and he would come in,\nand he put his tropical\nbird on the thing.\nAnd then George\n\"The Animal\" Steele,\nthe guy that would eat the ring.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK.\nSo and--\nRICK RUBIN: I believe\nhe was a professor.\nSeriously.\nSeriously.\nSeriously.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Was he really?\nRICK RUBIN: In real life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Amazing.\nRICK RUBIN: He was a professor,\nbut he played Georgia\n\"The Animal\" Steele\nas a wrestler.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nI loved the movie\nThe Wrestler, The Wrestler.\nRICK RUBIN: Darren\nAronofsky movie.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It\nwas Mickey Rourke.\nRICK RUBIN: With Mickey Rourke.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nOne of the reasons I liked it\nis I once visited Asbury Park.\nIsn't that where\nthat was filmed?\nThere's a vacant-- he goes\nto visit his daughter.\nThere's a vacant amusement park\nor abandoned amusement park\nscene there that\nwas really eerie,\nstill kind of haunts\nme a little bit.\nThere's something about\nthe East Coast in fall.\nAll the places that\npeople normally\ngo just for the summer,\nthat we don't have out here\nin the West coast,\npeople in the East Coast\nare just tougher than we are.\nIt still haunts me.\nGreat movie.\nBut I remember\nwatching wrestling,\nand it was at that age, I think\nI was probably about 12, 13,\nmaybe 11, 12, 13, where\nyou're entering puberty,\nand puberty is a fundamental\nlandmark of development.\nIt's the most rapid\nperiod of aging.\nIt's also when we start\nto change our rule set.\nLike certain people and\ncertain kinds of interactions\ntake on profoundly\ndifferent meaning.\nRight?\nIt's not just a reproductive\ncompetence time, and when kids,\ntheir bodies change.\nThe rulebook changes\nfundamentally.\nRICK RUBIN: Our understanding\nof the world changes\nin that moment.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nThe moment that a child\nunderstands really what sex is\nand how they got there and\nthat a lot of the stuff that we\nsee in the world is kind of\npassively, or not so passively,\nbeing sent through that filter,\nit's like it's something.\nIt changes the rule\nbook of perception.\nI view this age,\nfrom about 11 to 13,\nat least for me was a\nunique transition point.\nWhere the gap between what\nI perceived as reality\nand fiction was blurry.\nThis is captured pretty well\nin that movie \"Stand By Me,\"\nwhere they're hanging around\nthe campfire at night.\nAnd the kid says,\nwho do you think\nwould win in a fight between\nSuperman and Mighty Mouse?\nAnd the other kid\nsays, like you idiot,\nMighty Mouse is a cartoon.\nOf course Superman would win.\nAnd like to me, that's being\n11 and 1/2 or 12 years old.\nWhere your understanding\nof reality as you know\nit is changing, but\nit's not completely\ncrystallized into an\nadult form reality.\nRICK RUBIN: That sounds\nlike a really healthy place\nto be, to me, like that.\nNot letting it crystallize,\nI think there's\nwhere the downfall happens.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I have\na question specifically\nabout wrestling, but it's\nreally about process.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I want\nto know whether or not\nyou watch wrestling because it\nallows you to access the energy\nstate in your body and mind and\nthat mode of thinking in which\nreality, as one conceives\nit, is somewhat blurry.\nOr is it for a number of\nother reasons, which is fine.\nIs that the energy you're\ntrying to export and bring\nto the creative process\nelsewhere, to life?\nIs it that anything is\npossible, or that we're\ndealing with archetypes?\nBecause it doesn't matter if\nit's Koko B. Ware or Randy\n\"Macho Man\" Savage, or\nGeorge \"The Animal\" Steele\nand the lovely Elizabeth.\nI guess I did watch a\nlittle bit of wrestling.\nThey are archetypes,\nmuch like the Greek myths\nor the Bible or--\nno disrespect to the Bible or\nto Greek myths or to wrestling,\nfor that matter.\nArchetypes are a powerful\nfilter for humans,\nbut we know that they're\na very limited filter too,\nbecause people aren't built\nlike square wave functions.\nWe have curves and\ncontours and complexity.\nSo what is the deal with your\nrelationship to wrestling?\nRICK RUBIN: I think it\nmaintains that playfulness.\nAnything is possible.\nWe expect the unexpected\nall the time in wrestling.\nAnd it's a way to have\na feeling of the energy\nof a sport with no competition.\nEveryone is working together to\nput on the best show they can.\nSo it's more like a ballet than\nit is like a sporting event,\nand there's great\nskill involved.\nIt's one of the few things\nthat I can watch and really\nfeel relaxed.\nIt relaxes me.\nI don't feel like I\nhave to think about it.\nI can just relax and enjoy it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This\nbrings up a topic\nthat is very near and\ndear to my heart, which\nis this notion of\ndopamine schedules.\nI never want to reduce\neverything to dopamine,\nbut dopamine is the universal\ncurrency of delight, pleasure,\nmotivation seeking.\nThere are other\nchemicals involved too,\nbut there's a beautiful\nexperiment and a couple\nof examples that I'll\nuse as a foundation\nto more questions\nabout wrestling\nand why it's powerful.\nAnd why other people may\nwant to use wrestling\nor some other endeavor as a\nway to access creative energy\nand source.\nEarlier, we talked about\nyou can train an animal\nto press a lever three\ntimes and then get reward,\nand it will learn three is\nthe magic number for reward,\nand then it can switch.\nIt takes a little\nbit of training,\nand then they can switch.\nBut they can't do prime numbers.\nThey can't do high\nabstraction schedules.\nHumans either.\nWe're not very good at\nfiguring out the rule set\nfor optimal foraging.\nWe do it well enough to persist\nas a species, at least for now,\nbut it's very likely that we\nare not tapping into that system\nas well as we could,\nand how would we\nknow, if we don't know?\nIt's one of those you who don't\nknow what you don't knows.\nThere's a beautiful\nexperiment that\nexplored when\ndopamine is released\nin the context of watching\nsport or watching comedy,\nbelieve it or not.\nAnd with the comedy\nstuff, it was every time\nthere was a\nsurprise, it was kind\nof that jarring like\nha-ha, and they'd measure\npeople's dopamine output.\nThey were also brain imaging.\nIn a game of basketball,\nit's a beautiful opportunity\nexperimentally.\nBecause every time\none team gets the ball\nor is shooting free\nthrows or something,\nthey're going down\ncourt, and it's either\ngoing to end up in the\nbasket, or it's not.\nMight end up on the free throw\nline, but it's end up or not.\nSo what they found is that\nthe schedule of anticipation\nwas every time there was a\nswitch of which team got it.\nSo you're waiting,\nwaiting, and then it's, ah.\nYou're waiting, waiting.\nYes.\nWaiting, waiting, three-pointer.\nAh, awesome, and if\nsomething happened\nwhere it looked\nlike they were going\nto make the three-pointer, but\nthen somebody basically swatted\nthe ball away, and then\nwent for a half court shot,\nlike you don't expect that very\noften, bigger dopamine release.\nSo that's kind of how\nthe dopamine thing works.\nWhen you describe\nwrestling, I wonder,\nbecause you don't\nknow the script,\nit's not one team gets it,\nthen the other team gets it.\nYou don't know\nwho's going to win.\nAnything could happen\nis what you said.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThe availability\nof that dopamine surge or drip,\nwhich is a powerful thing,\nis completely--\nit's completely out of your\nreach in terms of anticipation.\nYou don't know when\nit's going to come,\nbut it must arrive often\nenough that you return to it\n11 hours a week of watching.\nIn many ways, the\nway I'm starting\nto conceptualize the creative\nprocess is a little bit\nthe same.\nYou don't know where\nthose nuggets of gold\nand those loose threads are,\nbut you have enough experience--\nand in this case, I am\nreferring to you specifically--\nto know that they are in there.\nThe people walking in this\nroom have a certain level\nof ability and talent to create\nthat the map will form itself,\nas we are going\nthrough the voyage.\nAnd those nuggets of--\nhere I'm calling them\ndopamine-- but they\nare out there,\nand that knowledge\nis enough to get you\nto come back again\nand again to trust the process.\nSo I actually think the way\nyou described wrestling as it's\nthe energy of the sport.\nIt's not whether or not\nit's this move or that move\nor who wins or who loses.\nIt's the energy,\nand I'm guessing\nit's the energy that it\ncreates in you as an observer.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nIt's the energy creates\nin me, and the reality\nthat it's honest in\nwhat it is, in a world\nwhere seemingly nothing\nis honest at what it is.\nAnd again, not because people\nare lying all the time.\nWe have little data, we make\nup a story to explain it,\nand then we say\nthat's what happened.\nAnd we have trusted sources\nwho do exactly what I just\ndescribed and who pass this\ndown as gospel of what we teach.\nAnd maybe it's true,\nand maybe it's not.\nWith wrestling, we know, maybe\nit's true, maybe it's not.\nWe lean towards\nit not being true,\nbut what's really\ninteresting about wrestling,\nand maybe one of the\nmost fun things about it,\nis that, sometimes, real life\nworks its way into the story.\nLike two wrestlers get married.\nNow--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In real life.\nRICK RUBIN: Well, we don't know.\nIt's like you never know.\nIt's like in the\nstoryline, they're\ngetting married or\ngetting divorced,\nor best friends\nturn on each other.\nAnd it could be\npart of the story,\nand it could really be\nhappening, because they do.\nRight?\nSomeone gets someone\nbreaks their leg.\nSo they're out, because\ntheir leg is broken.\nDid they break their leg?\nWe don't know.\nThey're out.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nWe're told they broke their leg.\nSo there's always this\nlike I wonder what's true?\nI wonder where the line is.\nWe know that it's scripted\nand/or predetermined.\nThat's how they say,\nit's predetermined.\nBut we don't know where reality\nis and isn't, and in some ways,\nthat's our real\nexperience of the world,\nis this we don't really know\nwhere reality is and isn't.\nWe have an idea, maybe.\nI think in some\nways, wrestling's\nmore honest or legitimate,\nbecause we start with the idea\nthat it's fixed.\nWhen we go to a boxing match,\nwe don't go to a boxing match\nthinking it's fixed.\nYet, it might be, and\nhistorically, it's happened.\nOr there was just something\nin baseball where--\nwas it baseball?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ndon't follow baseball.\nI should know.\nRICK RUBIN: It was\njust a big sports--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh.\nRICK RUBIN: One of\nthe teams that--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nplays, basically.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Was it\nthe call signals of the--\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Of the catcher?\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nYou're not supposed\nto deprogram the--\nor deconstruct the call\nsignals of the other team,\nand I guess maybe a team\ngot caught doing that.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes, and\nthe team that won\nwhatever the World Series was.\nSo it's like, with wrestling,\nthat wouldn't be a scandal.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAlmost anything goes.\nRICK RUBIN: Anything\ngoes, and that's\nwhat the world is really like.\nSo in some ways,\nit's comforting,\nand there's still this\nmystery of like, wow, I\nwonder if that's true or not,\nbecause we never really know.\nIf someone gets hurt, did\nthey really break their back,\nor are they just\ngoing on vacation?\nWe don't know.\nWe'll never know.\nIt's fascinating.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt is fascinating,\nand I feel like there are\ncertain people who show up\nin a way that is surprising\nin not just one direction\nbut in all directions.\nLike it's one thing\nfor a celebrity\nto come out and\nmake a statement.\nThat can be interesting\nor not interesting,\ndepending on the celebrity and\nthe statement and the delivery.\nAnd I'm probably going\nto get this wrong,\nbecause I'm terrible at pop\nculture things, most of them\nanyway.\nBut as I recall,\nLady Gaga showed up\nto some event wearing\nan outfit made of meat,\nand I can't tell you\nfor the life of me\nwhether or not that\nwas a statement\nagainst meat or for meat.\nMaybe, it was a statement\nfor the carnivore diet.\nMaybe, it was a\nstatement for veganism.\nI don't know.\nRICK RUBIN: Or maybe neither.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nOr maybe neither,\nbut it was definitely\na statement\nin that it broke with the norm.\nAnd it said to me, OK, she\ncreates different rules\nfor herself or breaks boundaries\nthat other people had.\nI never heard of anyone\ndoing that before.\nIt doesn't mean they hadn't,\nbut I never heard of anyone\ndoing it before.\nBut we do tend to associate\noutside the current playbook\nwith, quote,\nunquote, creativity,\nunless it crosses a\nline, in which case, it\nbecomes something else.\nIt becomes almost theater\nfor sake of theater.\nBut what you're telling me\nis that, within the realm\nof wrestling, theater is\nthe goal, at some level,\nand everybody knows it who\ngoes into those arenas, who\nwatches it.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Everybody.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd everyone agrees\nto kind of suspend\noutside reality\nand say this is reality.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes, and they boo\nfor the bad guys and cheer\nfor the good guys,\nknowing that backstage\nthey're probably friends.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nExcept for the kids\nthat are 11, who think\nit's really real.\nRICK RUBIN: I don't know.\nI don't even know if they know.\nI'm not sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nonly other person\nI know who has vocalized their\nlove of professional wrestling\nto the extent that you have is\nLars Frederiksen, the rhythm\nguitar player for Rancid\nwho loves wrestling.\nBut his statement--\nand forgive me, Lars,\nif I'm getting this wrong--\nis that, because he grew up\nin an area of the South Bay,\nwhere there were no teams.\nLike now, there's the\nSan Jose Earthquakes,\nbut there was no football\nteam in San Jose.\nHe's from Campbell.\nBut there were no like good\nteams, no sports teams,\nbut they had wrestling,\nand he had it where?\nOn the television set.\nAnd so if you\ndidn't have a-- like\nI didn't grow up with any\norganized sports thing.\nThe 49ers were up the road, but\nfor me, it was skateboarding,\nand I love it for\nthe same reason.\nYou actually never really\nknow what's going to happen.\nThere is no rulebook.\nThe rulebook is made\nup, but they are very--\nit's a unique sport, in that--\nsurfing's a bit like this too--\nin that, they are absolutely\nmaniacal about making\nthings look a certain way.\nIt's not about just doing it.\nIt's about doing it and\nmaking it look good.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSmooth, catching it\nwith the front foot,\nand the trends change.\nRICK RUBIN: Styles.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Style.\nRICK RUBIN: It's a style.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nStyle, and that style\nis this like nebulous thing of\nlike in fashion or in sports.\nRight.\nWhereas with a football,\nthere's some amazing catches.\nThere's even like the catch,\nwhich I happen to know\nis a 49er-- the catch\nduring the Super Bowl.\nBut in general, it's like the\ngoal is get in the end zone,\nwin the game.\nAnd I'm sure\nfootball players are\nlike cringing as\nI say this, but it\ndoesn't matter if you run\nugly, if you run fastest.\nIn skateboarding,\nthat would never fly.\nIn fact, you'd basically be\nridiculed out of the sport.\nIn wrestling, is it the same?\nAre there style to wrestling?\nRICK RUBIN: It's\nall performance.\nIt's all the charisma\nof the people involved.\nThere's the physical\nability, the ability\nto talk and tell a story,\nand how charismatic\nthe performers are.\nWhether you want to watch them,\nwhether you want to see them\nwin, whether you want\nto see them lose,\nand whether you're interested\nin cheering or booing for them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I was going\nto say it reminds me of opera,\nbut operas get released\nover and over again.\nYou know the story\nand how it ends\nwhen you walk in, if you've\nlistened to it before.\nSo wrestling does seem\nto be unique in that way.\nIt's real time\niteration, at least\nfrom the perspective of the--\nRICK RUBIN: And it's\nreal time iteration\nbased on because people\nget hurt all the time.\nThey're doing really\ncrazy physical stuff.\nSo if someone gets hurt,\nthe story has to change.\nBecause in real life, they\ncan't show up next week\nand do what was\nplanned in the script.\nSo it's very alive,\nand there's a lot of--\nsomething interesting and\nunexpected is always happening.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nin a much more calm form,\nI'll share with you\nsomething, I'd just\nlike your perspective on it.\nFor years, I used a tool in\norder to try and access ideas,\nsince I was a\nlittle kid actually,\nbecause I have a\nlittle bit of OCD,\na little bit of a Tourette's.\nWhen I get tired, I'll do that.\nI'm very strategy\nimplementation oriented.\nI had that when I\nwas a little kid,\nI needed all my stuffed animals\narranged in a certain way.\nLEGOs had to be--\na little neurotic or a lot.\nAnd then science is very much\nabout you have to do things\nwith a lot of precision.\nAnd I discovered that\nthe ultimate reset for me\nwhen I was in graduate\nschool or a postdoc\nif I couldn't make it to a\nreally good agnostic front\nshow, or like chaos.\nThe chaos of a punk rock\nshow for me was this reset.\nIt was to release\nall this thing.\nAnd I got energy from it.\nFirst time I saw\nTransplants play, it's was,\nwhoa, because you don't\nknow what's going to happen.\nAnd it was scary.\nAnd I loved it.\nThe other thing that\nI used over time\nto reset this ability to\nthink in a structured way\nwithout it feeling like\nit was overcoming me,\nmaybe even access the\nsame thing in some ways\nthat you're accessing\nwith wrestling\nwas I like to stare at aquaria.\nI like to go to aquariums\nor I'd build aquariums.\nAnd I would just sit\nthere because you never\nknow which way the\nfish are going to go.\nYou think it's going that\nway, but then all of a sudden\nthey'll turn and\ngo the other way.\nIt's completely unpredictable.\nAnd I love aquaria\nbecause of the tranquility\nand had them in my\nlab for a long time.\nI just adore aquariums because\nof the non-linearity of it.\nIt's not A, B, C.\nIt's A, Z, Z, Q.\nAnd I think this is what\nsome people try and access\nthrough psychedelics, but that\ndidn't seem to me like a very\ngood way to do it\non a regular basis,\nwhereas with aquaria,\nthe tanks are there.\nSo in your book, you\ntalk about something\nthat I also share\na love for, which\nis how the ocean and aspects of\nnature like clouds and ocean,\nthey have a\npredictability to them.\nWe know where they are\nand where to find them.\nFortunately, the sun rises\nand sets every day, at least\nfor now.\nAnd we can count on them\nwith 100% reliability.\nAnd yet, they are\nfrom the perspective\nof what physicists would\nsay, they're very chaotic.\nYou can't look at a wave\nand know exactly how\nthe foam is going to roll out.\nYou know it's going to\nroll in and roll out.\nWe have the tides, but when\nI hear about wrestling,\nI think about my\nlove of aquaria.\nAnd I think about my love of\npunk rock music, for instance,\nor I think about the ocean.\nI think in that way that we\nactually have a need to source\nfrom things that have both\na combination of structure\nand no structure.\nRICK RUBIN: I think\nit's interesting\nthat there are some\nplaces that don't change\nand some places\nthat change a lot.\nAnd I can remember\nthinking about this.\nI was walking-- there's\na beach that I walk on\nin Hawaii, that I walk on\nevery morning when I'm there.\nAnd if you walk on the\nsame beach every day,\nyou get a sense\nof what it's like.\nAnd I remember I was in Hawaii.\nI walked on the beach\nevery day for a year\nor however long it was.\nAnd then I left for six\nmonths, then I came back.\nAnd the next time I\nwalked on the beach,\nit was an entirely different\nbeach, entirely different.\nAnd I remember\nthinking in that moment\nlike this is an unusual\nplace because I pictured\nthe house that I\ndidn't even grow up in,\nthe house I lived in\nmaybe for the first seven\nyears of my life.\nAnd I think about what\nthe backyard looked like.\nAnd I think about a particular\nold tree that was there.\nAnd I don't know this\nfor sure, but my sense\nis, if I were to go\nback to where I grew up,\nand go to that place,\nand look in that yard,\nit would probably\nlook pretty similar.\nYet, here was this\nbeach that I was\nwalking on in Hawaii that\nin the course of six months\ncompletely changed its face.\nAnd just how interesting\nboth of those things are.\nAnd that depending\non the project\nwe're working on, to be\nable to go to a place\nthat we know has the\npotential to change a lot\nand what that would do to\nour connection with the Earth\nwhen we're experiencing that\nversus going to a place that\nhas very little change.\nAnd you can count on it being\nthe way it's always been.\nThat both of those\nare interesting things\nto be able to draw\nupon depending on what\nwe want to open in our psyche.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I have an\nalmost unhealthy fascination\nwith New York in the\nmid '80s and '90s.\nRICK RUBIN: You didn't\nlive there, though.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No,\nbut since I was a kid--\nI went there when\nI was a little kid.\nAnd I was fascinated by it.\nThere's also a very\ninteresting migration\nof East Coast to\nWest Coast creatives,\nincluding yourself, that played\nan important part in my life\njust seeing things\nand hearing things\nthat were meaningful to me.\nBut I, for instance,\nI love the movie--\nI haven't seen the documentary\nabout Jean-Michel Basquiat,\nBasquiat, because of the\ncharacters that are in it,\nand the huge number of people in\nthat like Parker Posey, Dennis\nHopper, and Christopher\nWall, and on, and on.\nThose images of New York at\nthat time are so exciting\nand what was happening.\nI wish I could transplant\nmyself to that.\nIf I had a time machine,\nthat's where I'd land first.\nI hear a lot of people say, New\nYork isn't what it used to be.\nSan Francisco isn't what\nit used to be, whatever.\nLA isn't what-- there\ndoes seem to be something\nthat feels a little bit\ndisruptive to people\nabout cities changing.\nBut the idea that natural\nlandscapes change is actually--\nwe even accept like, hey,\nfires sweep through places.\nAnd assuming they weren't\nstarted by humans,\nwe accept that.\nThat change and the\nreordering of landscapes\nis normal and healthy.\nAnd I always tell\nmyself, you have\nthe kids growing up in New York,\nor San Francisco, or Chicago\nnow.\nThey only know it that way.\nSo to them, it's as\ncool or as uncool\nas it's ever going to be.\nThey either want to\nget out or they're\nloving every piece of it.\nAnd this happened for all the\npeople that came before us.\nSo my question is\na very basic one.\nDo you miss the New York\nthat you came up in?\nAre you somebody who is\nattached to the past?\nRICK RUBIN: I'm not\nattached at all.\nI'm not attached to\nanything in the past.\nI don't look back at all.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You don't\nthink about, oh, in my dorm room\nat NYU, Beastie Boys, this.\nI miss-- no.\nYour optics are forward,\npresent and forward.\nRICK RUBIN: Only\npresent and forward.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is\nthere a process to that\nor it just happens to\nbe where you default to?\nRICK RUBIN: I don't know.\nI'm not sure, but\nthat's how I do it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Nostalgia\nis not in Rick Rubin's brain.\nRICK RUBIN: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Lucky you, man.\nRICK RUBIN: No.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I say that\nwith genuine admiration.\nSo you can hear a\nsong that maybe you\nhad a role in producing or\nnot, something from the past.\nAnd you're accessing\na state, presumably,\nbut you're not pining\nfor wishing how it was.\nRICK RUBIN: Never.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI'm no psychologist,\nbut I'm going to venture\nto say that I think\nthat's a very unique quality.\nI think a lot of people wish\nfor or wish that things did not\nhappen the way they\ndid, that there's\na lot of living in the past.\nThere's a lot of this notion\nof people future trip.\nI don't actually think that's\nthe default state of the brain.\nI think a lot of people live in\nemotional anchors to the past,\ngood and bad.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nI have none.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nwatching wrestling\nis one way that you\ncleanse the palate.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When you\ngo to a meal and you--\nthey pass around this or that--\nI don't know if they do\nthis anymore, but pass\naround a little bit of\nsorbet to cleanse the palate.\nIt turns out there's a\nbiological reason for that.\nThere's a kind of\nneutralization of the taste\nreceptors between savory,\nand sweet, et cetera.\nSo wrestling is your\npalate neutralizer.\nRICK RUBIN: I know\nthat if I watch\nwrestling before I\ngo to sleep, it's\ngoing to be a good\nnight's sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\ndream about wrestling?\nRICK RUBIN: No, never.\nBut it's just relaxing.\nIt's just relaxing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nDo you anticipate\nwhen you watch it, like\nhere comes the dopamine hit?\nRICK RUBIN: Sometimes, sometimes\nwhen it happens it's exciting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: He's going\nup for the three-pointer.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah,\nsometimes it's exciting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBut do you enjoy--\nRICK RUBIN: But even then,\nit's like the stakes are low.\nIt's like I don't really care\nwhat happens, which feels good.\nI'm just being entertained.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do they\nactually get hurt sometimes?\nYou said they do.\nRICK RUBIN: A lot, often.\nThey do.\nI mean, they're\nbasically stunt men.\nSo imagine stuntmen getting\nhurt doing a crazy stunt.\nIt happens all the time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When\nthe movie The Wrestler,\nI remember he got\nstaples stapled into him.\nAnd I thought that's\npretty intense.\nI once went and saw--\nI guess they called\nit Mexican wrestling.\nI don't know if they\ncall it that anymore,\nwhere the guys dip their hands--\nRICK RUBIN: Lucha libre.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, they\ndip their hands in glass.\nThis was in Sacramento.\nAnd I once saw it.\nI honestly didn't\nhave a stomach for it.\nI really didn't.\nI couldn't believe it was legal.\nIt might not have been legal.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I thought--\nRICK RUBIN: There's crazy\nstuff in wrestling sometimes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nSo before sleep,\nis that typically\nwhen you watch wrestling?\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Do you\nthink it's useful for people\nto have some activity that\nallows them to clear their mind\nand create peace before\nheading off to sleep?\nRICK RUBIN: I think so.\nAnd I think yoga\nnidras would be good.\nIt's like yoga\nnidra, pro wrestling,\nany of those type things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, not\nwatching the Dahmer thing.\nI won't watch that.\nRICK RUBIN: I don't watch\nany horror, anything,\nor I don't like violent things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nI know it exists.\nI know horrible things\nhappen in the world,\nbut I certainly don't want\nto do that before sleep.\nI think these liminal states\nbefore and emerging from sleep\nare very powerful.\nWhen you wake up in the\nmorning, are your thoughts\nimmediately structured\nor do you enjoy\nthe clearing of the clouds?\nRICK RUBIN: It's a slow\nprocess for me to wake up.\nAnd I like that.\nI like not engaging\ntoo much too soon.\nI usually fall asleep listening\nto a lecture or something\nspeaking because\nif I don't, I can\nget caught in my own thoughts.\nAnd listening to something\nis enough of a focus point\nthat it stops me from\ntalking to myself.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I do the same.\nMy grandfather listened to the\nradio, to sports on the radio.\nAnd he would fall asleep.\nOftentimes, he was a smoker\nwith a cigarette in his mouth.\nHis wife's responsibility\nwas to stay\nup later than he did to make\nsure he didn't burn everything\ndown.\nAnd then when you wake up,\nyou said it's a slow process.\nIs it an hour or two before\nyou feel like you're--\nRICK RUBIN: I would\nsay probably an hour.\nI usually wake up and\ntry to get in the sun\nas soon as I possibly\ncan and hope to spend--\nhope to spend about an hour.\nAnd then I'll\nusually go for a walk\non the beach for another hour\nor 90 minutes, depending.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are\nyou with family members\nand other people at that time?\nRICK RUBIN: No, I'm\nusually focused by myself.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Phone?\nRICK RUBIN: I'll be\nlistening to something.\nI don't look at the phone, but\nI listen to, again, a lecture,\nor podcast, or audiobook.\nI like audiobooks a lot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I do too.\nIf an idea comes to mind\ndo you write it down?\nRICK RUBIN: I may, it depends.\nI like to.\nI usually have-- would\ndo a note in my phone.\nI don't usually carry pen and\npaper with me when I'm walking.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, I do the same.\nI do a long Sunday hike or jog.\nAnd I will audio\nscript into my phone.\nPeople sometimes\ngive me funny looks\nbecause I'm talking to myself.\nRICK RUBIN: That's a nice\nway to do it, though.\nI'd like to learn more of\nthe audio methods of doing it\ninstead of the typing methods.\nRight now I type and I don't\nthink it's the best way.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The voice\nmemos function in the iPhone\nand other phones is really good.\nAnd there are now\ncompanies like rev.com\nthat will turn those\ninto Word docs scripts\nthat are fairly well\ncorrected, fairly inexpensive.\nNo, they're not a\nsponsor of the podcast.\nI just happen to use it.\nIt's great.\nI actually learned that\ntrick from Richard Axel,\nthe Nicorette chewing, wild\nman, Nobel Prize winner.\nHe writes manuscripts by walking\naround his office, pacing,\nand talking into his phone.\nRICK RUBIN: I always think\nof the Woody Allen movie\nwhere the Alan Alda character\nis talking about-- yeah,\nhe's speaking comedy\nideas into the phone.\nIt's really pretentious.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nI liked that movie\nabout Harvey Milk, that Sean\nPenn played Harvey Milk,\nbecause that all took\nplace before I was alive,\nmostly, in the Bay Area.\nBut there's these\nbeautiful scenes of him,\nas I recall, sitting there\nat his kitchen table talking\ninto a tape recorder\nat night, talking\nabout how he predicted that he\nwould be possibly assassinated,\net cetera.\nAnd this goes back\nto the Strummer thing\nabout writing things down.\nI think that a lot of\npeople, including myself\nfeel a little bit of\negotistical guilt around,\nwho am I to think\nthat my ideas could\nbe worthwhile or something?\nBut I think over time,\nI've come to realize\nthat the ideas about\nexperiments or questions\nI have about health,\nthey don't always,\nbut oftentimes can lead to real\nseeds that grow into big trees.\nRICK RUBIN: But it's something\nthat's interesting to you,\nit doesn't matter what\nanyone else thinks.\nMost of my notes are\nnot for anyone else's--\nfor anyone else's used.\nLike I hear about something\nthat's interesting to me\nand I think about, OK,\nI want to learn more\nabout this, whatever it is.\nAnd then, sometimes those\nthings work their way\ninto things I'm doing\nbecause the universe seems\nto work in that way, but I\nrarely am learning something\nwith the idea of using it.\nI learn things with the idea\nof, this is what I want to know.\nThis is what's\ninteresting to me.\nAnd then often those things\nthat are interesting to me\ncan find their way into other\nprojects just because they do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, that's\nalmost like coal or kindling,\nbut the moment that you\nthink of it that way,\nit sounds so extractive.\nSo you take this walk\nand you're writing down\nthe occasional idea, perhaps.\nAnd then what is the next--\nthe way that--\nhere are less than,\ndo this, then this, then that.\nI'm interested in, where\ndoes your mind shift to?\nDoes it become more\nstructured as the day goes on?\nDoes your thinking\nbecome more structured\naround projects and plans?\nRICK RUBIN: I try\nto deal with things\nthat need dealing\nwith after that\nand in preparation\nfor going to work.\nAnd then when I go to\nwork, it's more like free--\nthis free thing where I'm,\nagain, hoping something good\ncomes, welcoming something good,\npaying attention, and maybe\ntrying to will it to\nhappen, but knowing I\ndon't have the ability\nto make it happen.\nI can just be present for it\nand be ready if it does arrive.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Some of the\nmore surprising and I found\nreally interesting and\nuseful features of the book\nwere about dancing\nwith structure and lack\nof structure.\nSo when I think of structure,\nI think of deadlines.\nSo when you are in the\nprocess of creating something,\nobviously, deadlines are\nrelevant, time of day.\nThere's only so many\nhours in the day\nwhere one can stay in the groove\nor the readiness to receive.\nHave you ever found\nyourself in that mode\nwhere you're grinding\nlike, oh, here we are.\nOK, I'm not coming\nhome for dinner.\nIt's the next-- we're going\nto push, put on the coffee pot\nkind of thing.\nRICK RUBIN: A lot.\nA lot.\nOver the course of my life,\na lot, not as much now.\nAnd one of the things\nthat I discovered\nthrough working on the book\nwas the phases of work--\nwe're not required to treat\nthe different phases of work\nin the same way,\nwhereas before, I did.\nBefore, everything was\nin this state of play.\nEverything had a wide\nopen time schedule.\nIt happens when it happens.\nAnd if it takes two years or\nthree years, it doesn't matter.\nIt's not about that.\nIt's only about this\nthing has to be great.\nAnd what I came to realize\nin working on the book\nis that there are\ndifferent phases.\nAnd the first phase is\nthis seed collecting phase,\nwhich is an ongoing\npart of life in general.\nI do that.\nI do that always whether I'm\nworking on something or not.\nI'm always in the\nseed collecting phase.\nAnd there's no deadline or\njust anything that interests\nme that I think I want\nto learn more about\nor has potential to be\nsomething, anything.\nI hear something,\nI think, uhm, I'd\nlike to read more\nabout that, or I wonder\nif there's a movie about that.\nIs there a movie about that?\nIf not, maybe there's\na movie to be made.\nAgain, I want-- this is\nsomething I want in my life.\nLet's see if it exists.\nIf it doesn't exist,\nthen maybe that's\nsomething interesting to pursue.\nBut I know that the desire\nis there because I have it.\nSo in the seed phase,\nthere's no deadlines.\nIt's just a wide open part.\nAnd then the next phase is\ncalled the experimentation\nphase, where we start\nexperimenting to see\nwhat the seeds want to do.\nYou're involved but\nyou're more of a--\nyou're not really\ndictating the action.\nYou're setting the stage\nfor something to happen,\nbut it's not about you yet.\nSo it'd be like the equivalent\nof you'd plant the seed.\nYou'd would water it.\nYou'd make sure\nit was in the sun.\nAnd you'd wait.\nSo you're involved, but\nyou can't make it grow.\nAnd then when it\nsprouts, and it grows,\nor if it turns into a plant,\nthen you can look at the plants\nlike, OK, how does this plant--\nwhat's the potential\nof this plant?\nAnd then that the third phase\nis the crafting phase, where\nit's like, OK, I\nhave this plant,\nmaybe I'm going to\ntrim it or maybe I'm\ngoing to combine it\nwith these other plants\nto make something else with it.\nNow, it's like\nmaterial that you have.\nAnd then finally is the\ncompletion or finishing phase,\nwhich is the final edit,\ngetting to the version of it--\nthe version of it\nthat's the one that you\ncan share with the\nworld if that's\nsomething you're going to do.\nAnd I've come to\nrealize that by the time\nyou're going into the completion\nphase, you can have a deadline.\nAnd it won't hurt the project.\nIn fact, it might\nhelp the project.\nAnd I didn't know that before.\nSo I've worked on projects\nthat have gone longer than they\nnecessarily needed\nto and maybe not\nin the best interests\nof the project\nbecause I didn't know that.\nI didn't understand\nthe timing of that\nbecause I am so aware\nof the necessity\nin the experimental phase to not\nhave a deadline that I assumed\nthat held through\nthe whole project.\nAnd they're not-- it's not\na clear phase one finishes,\nand then you start phase two.\nPhase two finishes and\nyou start phase three.\nYou move back and\nforth between them.\nI'm collecting\nseeds all the time.\nI'm always in phase one.\nAnd then, probably\nto some degree,\nthere's always some version of\nexperimentation going on, maybe\nnot now, but if something's\non a list of things\nI want to look at, hopefully,\nI'll get to the list\nand give them some\nexperimentation\nand see what they can turn into.\nAnd then if they do\nturn into something,\nthen they get to the crafting\nphase where it's more, OK,\nnow I have this thing.\nWhat do I know about this thing?\nWhat can I match this with?\nWhat can I use this for?\nHow can I be involved\nas a craftsman?\nAnd by the end of\nthe crafting phase\nor deep into the crafting phase,\nyou can start seeing the end.\nYou can start seeing an end.\nAnd then you can\neven dictate an end.\nBut I recommend, if\nyou do, just dictate it\nfor you not for anyone else\nbecause if something comes up\nwhere you learn-- if you set\na deadline, public deadline,\nand then a new discovery\nhappens along the way.\nAnd you realize, oh,\nthis could actually\nbe much better than I\nthought, but I need more time,\nit's harder to do that\nif you set the deadline.\nSo I would say, have an internal\ndeadline to get to finish it.\nThat said, if an unusual\nsituation comes up\nand it's better for everything\nnot to meet that deadline,\nit's one of those rules that--\nyou set the rule\nto break it if it's\nwhat's best for the project.\nBut that was a new thing for me.\nAnd it helped me a lot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When\ndid you realize that?\nRICK RUBIN: In collecting\nthe material for the book\nand thinking about it.\nWhen I realized\nthat it was phases--\nI didn't know any of this.\nWhen I started\nwriting the book, I\ndidn't know hardly any of\nthe things in the book.\nMost of it would be reverse\nengineering something\nthat I had experienced,\na successful experience\nusing these methods without\nknowing they were methods, just\nfollowing my instincts\ngot me to something good.\nAnd then I would look back\nat, why did I want to do that?\nAnd is there a principle\nat play that could\nbe of use outside of this case?\nAnd how do I explain that?\nAnd that's what\nthe book is, these\nreverse engineered\nprinciples that\nhave led to a good decision\nmaking and try and make things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The\nchapter on self-doubt\nwas really interesting to me.\nRICK RUBIN: Tell me what it\nsays because I can't remember.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'll\nread the first sentence of it,\nwhich is that self-doubt\nlives in all of us.\nAnd while we may wish it was\ngone, it is there to serve us.\nAnd it goes on to describe\nhow to dance with self-doubt\nin not so many words.\nI think there's a\nsaying that is actually\nfrom the landscape of\npsychology, which is generally\ndiscussed in a pathological\ncontext, which is, if nothing\nmatters, anything goes.\nThis is usually the phrase\nused to describe people\nwho feel as if there's\nno use in living,\nso just go crazy,\noften to self destruct.\nBut there's a light\nversion of this, I realize,\nwhere in some sense the\ncreative process seems\nto have something to do with--\nif you're not paying\nattention to what\noutcomes are like who likes\nit, who doesn't like it,\nand you're just doing it for\nyou, you make the rule play,\nI want to delight myself.\nWell then, anything\ngoes and you have\nan infinite rule set\nthere to extract from,\nat least initially.\nSo as one gets better\nat their craft,\nyou can imagine\nself-doubt goes down.\nI think that's the perception\nof a lot of people.\nYou get better at\nwhat you're doing.\nYou can land free throws\nas a basketball player.\nYou can hit more home\nruns as a baseball player.\nYou can produce more\nplatinum albums as an artist.\nSelf confidence goes up.\nSelf-doubt goes down.\nBut I think you and\nI both know a number\nof people who are\nsuccessful enough\nto know that oftentimes there's\na mirror image to that, where\npeople feel pressure\nbecause they did it once now\nthey got to do it again.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes or that you\nthink you're so good at it\nthat it comes easily and you\ndon't have to apply yourself.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Arrogance.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nSo self-doubt it's like a--\nit's a check on yourself.\nIt can either be really helpful\nor it can undermine you.\nSo it's something we all have.\nAnd if we let it undermine us,\nthen we don't make anything\nand that's not good.\nBut when used as a\nbalancing tool in our lives,\nit serves a great function\nwhere we really do--\nit's OK to have\nall the confidence\nin the world and\nstill second guess,\nis this the best it can be?\nYou can doubt--\nI think the phrase\nis in the book.\nYou can doubt your way to a\ngreat work, to a masterpiece.\nSometimes that\nquestioning allows\nyou to push further\nthan just accepting,\nI made it so it's good.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I've\nencountered more people that\nseem to be driven by\nself-doubt and the need\nto constantly perform\nand perform again,\nthen I have real arrogance.\nJust hasn't been my\nexperience, fortunately.\nI've met some arrogant\npeople in my life.\nAnd of course, we never--\nas a psychiatrist who I admire\na lot and bio-engineer who\nwas a guest on this\npodcast Carl Di Saraf said,\nwe never really know\nhow other people feel.\nI mean, most of the time, we\ndon't even know how we feel.\nAgain, language is a\nvery deprived format\nfor explaining feelings.\nSo we think somebody feels\none way but we can observe--\nand it could be another, but\nwe observe their behavior.\nSo in the sense of\nreturning to the work,\njust always\nreturning to process,\nit sounds like your routine is\nfairly scripted, at least now.\nBut the things that\nyou are getting\nin touch with-- wrestling,\nsleep and dreaming, the ocean,\nthere's a predictability of\nthem because you can access them\nin a predictable\nway, but they seem\nto have a lot of\nunpredictability in them.\nThe ocean is completely\nunpredictable.\nRICK RUBIN: I also listen to a\nlot of music that I don't know.\nSo I listen to a lot of\nclassical music, and less so\nbut some jazz, and\na lot of old music\nthat I never heard before.\nAnd I like being\nsurprised by music.\nAnd sometimes it really\ncatches me off guard.\nI shazam a lot when I\nhear something I like.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Have\nyou ever encountered\nmusic that really\nworks well live\nbut just does not\nwork in a recording?\nOr that it's much better\nlive but the recording is\nsort of, meh.\nYou don't have to name names.\nRICK RUBIN: I don't think so.\nI feel like maybe there\nare some artists who\nare great live who've never\ncaptured it well on record.\nExample would probably\nbe the Grateful Dead\nis a good example\nof a band where\nI feel like their albums\nare not their strong point.\nBut if you hear live\nrecordings, they're\nreally interesting and really\ndifferent from each other.\nAnd that's part of what makes\nthe Grateful Dead interesting\nis their unpredictability.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I confess.\nI had a sister who listened\nto the Grateful Dead.\nAnd I got taken to a few\nshows when I was younger.\nAnd they would do that--\nwas it called space?\nIt was these drum\nsolos that would go on\nfor hours and hours.\nThis is like the antithesis\nof punk rock shows,\nwhere songs are like\n90 to 120 seconds.\nAnd I remember\nthinking, what is this?\nWhat is this?\nBut people I know, who\nlove the Grateful Dead,\nlove that uncertainty about\nwhere that drum thing--\nI think they do call it space.\nForgive me deadheads.\nI'm not enough of\none to get it right.\nRICK RUBIN: But they're\nlooking for something.\nAnd sometimes they find it.\nAnd if you're there\nwhen they find it,\nit feels exciting\nbecause it's not just--\nit's not just\nfollowing a script.\nIt's like something\nis really happening.\nIt's a real moment.\nSomething that I aim\nfor in the studio\nis to create real moments\nthat when you hear them,\nthey don't necessarily\nsound perfect.\nThey sound like something\nthat really happened.\nAnd in that moment,\nsomething happened.\nAnd it's a special moment.\nAnd you can feel that if\nthey were to play it again,\nit wouldn't be like that.\nThere's something really\nexciting about that.\nIt's really what-- it's\nhow jazz works as well.\nAnd I think some of-- bringing\nsome of that jazz mentality\ninto other types of music\nis really interesting,\nmakes for compelling things,\nbecause when you hear them,\nthere's a certain amount of--\nyou really have to pay\nattention to do it.\nWhen you're doing it, you're\nreally paying attention.\nIt's like, I don't really know.\nThere's no music.\nThere's no map to follow.\nAnd now we're working\ntogether to make something.\nDo I play or not play?\nWhen do I play?\nAnd you're really\npaying attention.\nAnd can I add or you go\nto start adding something.\nAnd someone else\nadded something.\nIt's like, oh, I can't do that.\nAnd it's like everyone's\njust in this thing,\nin this moment experiencing\nthis thing at once that you\ncan feel as a listener.\nAnd we get to hear their\nexcitement of finding it.\nAnd it's thrilling\nwhen it happens.\nSo I like that experience.\nI feel that's what\nthe Dead do live.\nThey'll play songs\nin different ways.\nAnd again, I don't know\nvery much about the Dead.\nIt's newer for me to\nlisten to the Dead.\nGrowing up, I never\nlisten to the Dead,\nbut probably because I\nheard songs on their albums\nand thought, this doesn't\nreally speak to me.\nBut I think that the\nalbums don't really reflect\nwhat's special about them.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think\na lot of their shows\nwere recorded or videotaped--\nRICK RUBIN: By fans\nwhich they supported.\nThey supported that everybody\ncome, everybody tape,\neverybody trade tapes.\nIt made sense for\nwho that band was.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: They\nredefined or they defined--\nexcuse me, the\nnotion of followers.\nI mean, people literally\ngave up their lives\nor spent much of their lives\nliterally driving from city\nto city to follow them.\nRICK RUBIN: Because it's not\nlike going from city to city\nto watch a movie over and\nover because it's not a movie.\nIt's different every night.\nIt's changing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's pretty\nincredible phenomenon.\nI don't know of anything else\nquite like it except cults.\nAnd those often don't end well.\nI think a guy that mixed\nthe punch for the Jonestown\nMassacre went to my high school.\nRICK RUBIN: Is that true?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think so.\nRICK RUBIN: That's amazing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMy sister is really\ngood at all this '70s, '80s\ndark psychology trivia.\nShe's a very light person.\nRICK RUBIN: Did you read\nSeason of the Witch.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: No.\nRICK RUBIN: It's about\nSan Francisco in the '60s.\nIt's great.\nYou'll love it.\nGreat book.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nought to check it out.\nThe way you describe\nexperiences going by in time,\nor things emerging in time,\nand the creative process being\na way of capturing those\nmoments, maybe rearranging,\nmaybe watering, et\ncetera, I thought\nwas beautifully captured\nin the analogy you\ngave about a conveyor\nbelt going by of things.\nWe think of the creative process\nlike it's going to land in us,\nor we're going to\nenter it, or that we're\ngoing to sit there in a\nchair and grit our teeth.\nThere's some Hemingway\nquote where you just\nsit there and stare at the\npage until the beads of blood\nform on your forehead or\nsomething, maybe it was him,\nmaybe it was--\nI don't know.\nIt sounds like\nBukowski or something.\nAnyway, I'm going\nto get this wrong.\nPeople tell me in the comments.\nMaybe no one said it.\nIt was a dream.\nBut I love this\nconveyor belt thing.\nThat reminds me of\nbeing in laboratory,\ndoing experiments thinking I\nwas trying to solve one thing,\nand then seeing\nsomething else, and then\nhaving to make the decision,\nlike is that really cool enough\nto drop everything and go that\ndirection, or to spend a night,\nor a week, or a\ncareer going that way?\nI mean, these are\nbig decisions, given\nthat at least as far\nas we know, we're\ngoing to live 100 years or less.\nBut this idea that we have\nthoughts and experiences\nin our past.\nAnd we can draw on,\nand try, and make\ngood decisions-- do we grab\nthese things off the conveyor\nor not?\nI'm hearing you.\nAnd I'm starting to realize\nthat being attached to the past\nmight be the worst\nthing that one could\ndo in terms of\nbeing able to make\ngood decisions in this\ncontext, because we\nhave a playbook of what's\nworked and what hasn't worked.\nBut you actually\ntalk about this--\nthere's a passage\nin the book that--\nI'll just read it.\nTo be aware of the assumption\nthat the way you work\nis the best way simply\nbecause it's the way\nyou've done it before.\nI sat with this page for almost\n10 full minutes, which is not\nsomething I do very often.\nMaybe you could elaborate\non this a little bit.\nI mean, we want to have\nmechanisms and routines we\ncan trust, but this is, I\nthink, an important warning.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah\nwhen something works,\nit's easy to be\nfooled into believing\nthat's the way to do it\nor that's the right way.\nIt's just a way.\nAnd it's just a way that\nhappened to work that time.\nAnd this plays into\nwhen you get advice\nfrom people who have\nmore experience than you.\nYou explain your situation.\nThey tell you their advice.\nThe advice that\nthey're giving you\nis not based on your\nlife or your experience.\nIt's based on their life\nand their experience.\nAnd the stories\nthat they're telling\nare based on\nexperiences they've had,\nthat have very different\ndata points than yours.\nSo maybe they're\ngiving you good advice,\nbut maybe they're giving\nyou good advice for them\nand not giving you\ngood advice for you.\nAnd it's easy when we\ntry something and have\na result, a positive\nresult thinking,\neverybody can do this.\nThe way I was vegan for\na long time, 22 years.\nAnd then I started eating--\nI started eating animal\nprotein and then eventually\nchanged my diet a few\ntimes to the point\nwhere I lost a lot of weight.\nThe way that I did\nit worked for me.\nRight before that happened, I\ndid something that I was told\nthat everyone else who did what\nyou did, they all lost weight,\nfor whatever reason, I didn't.\nSo the idea that we know\nwhat's right for someone else--\nI think, it's hard\nenough to even figure out\nwhat's right for ourselves.\nAnd if we do somehow crack the\ncode of what's right for us,\nbe happy we have it,\nand then still know,\nI wonder if that's the only way.\nMaybe there's an even better\nway that we're not considering.\nNot to get comfortable\nwith thinking\nwe know how it works\njust because we\nget the outcome we want.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I was raised\nin science with a principle.\nIt was literally dictated\nto me as a principle,\nalmost like a rule\nof religion, which\nwas that the brain is plastic.\nIt can change and learn\nuntil you're about 25.\nAnd then the critical\nperiods end and that's it.\nAnd this was a rule.\nEssentially, it was\ndictated a Nobel Prize,\nwhich was very deserved,\ngiven to my scientific great\ngrandparents.\nThey deserve it.\nBut I was told there was no\nchanging of brain structure\nfunction in any meaningful\nway after age 25 or so.\nIt turns out that's\ncompletely wrong.\nSorry David and Torsten,\nbut they knew it was wrong.\nRICK RUBIN: Wow,\nthat's interesting.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, it was actively\nsuppressed because of the\ncompetitive nature of prizes\nand discoveries at that time.\nAnd a guy named Mike\nMerzenich and his student,\nGregg Recanzone were showing\nthat adult plasticity exists\nand only now is this really\nstarting to emerge as a theme,\njust crazy.\nThere were so many reasons\nand the textbooks said it.\nWe were all told it.\nAnd it changed our behavior.\nNow we know this to\nbe completely false.\nThere's plasticity\nthroughout the lifespan.\nThere's limits to\nit here and there,\nbut it's just far and\naway a different story.\nRICK RUBIN: So why would\nthat be the only time that\never happened?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Exactly.\nBut the field was run\nby a very small cabal\nof people at that time.\nRICK RUBIN: All fields are run\nby a very small cabal of people\nwho have an investment in things\nbeing the way they are now\nbecause they're in charge.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\none of the great things\nabout getting older is that--\nwell, fortunately,\neveryone eventually ages.\nAnd I hope that--\nDavid unfortunately passed away.\nHe was lovely.\nTorsten is lovely.\nHe's still alive.\nAnd they would say--\nI think Torsten\nwould say, yeah, we\nshould have been a\nlittle more open or kind\nin allowing these other ideas.\nBut I think that--\nRICK RUBIN: But just\nthink about all the years\nthat were wasted with\nthis misunderstanding.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\nAnd it went beyond that.\nAnd there were BBC specials\nthat helped propagate this.\nAnd one of the\ngoals of the podcast\nhas been to try and shed,\nshine light on ideas\nthat at first seem crazy.\nI know you and I are both\nsemi-obsessed with the health\nbenefits of light.\nAnd you hear about this stuff\nlike negative ion therapy.\nIt sounds crazy, right?\nSounds like something\nyou would only hear about\nat Esalen or in Big Sur.\nTurns out negative ionization\ntherapy for sleep and mood\nis based on really amazing work\nout of Columbia by a guy named\nMichael Terman.\nThe Nobel Prize, I\nthink it was in 1916,\nwas given for phototherapy\nfor the treatment of lupus.\nThis idea that certain\nwavelengths of light\ncan help treat medical\nconditions is not a new idea.\nBut somehow, we see a red light.\nWe're not used to seeing\nred lights except in sunsets\nand on stoplights.\nAnd somehow, it bothers people\nor it makes them feel like--\nRICK RUBIN: It undermines\na business model\nthat doesn't take red\nlight into consideration.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nUntil it does and then\nit was-- and then\nit's co-opted there.\nAnd the place what I\nlook to is acupuncture.\nFor a lot of years, people\nsaid, well, acupuncture, this\nis like no mechanism, no\nmechanism, no mechanism.\nThere's a lab at Harvard,\na guy named Qiufu Ma,\nwho I reasonably\nwell, whose laboratory\nis dedicated to trying to figure\nout the biological mechanisms\nof acupuncture.\nAnd they are discovering\nwhat everyone\nis known for thousands\nof years, which\nis that incredible effects\non anti-inflammation, the gut\nmicrobiome.\nRICK RUBIN: I have\na friend who was\nhaving a terrible back problem.\nAnd I suggested that he\nsee an acupuncturist.\nAnd he went to the\nacupuncturist that I suggested.\nAnd his back problem completely\nhealed almost instantaneously.\nAnd I asked him, have\nyou been keeping up,\nbecause he had another flare up.\nHe's like, no.\nI can't go back there because\nacupuncture doesn't work.\nI said, well, you\nsaw it work for you.\nHe's like, yeah, but\nthere's no science.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWow, he's got it--\nnow there's good science and\npublished in premier journals.\nWhat's interesting is there's\na little bit of science\neditorial, but since we like\nto exchange information about\nhealth and things of that\nsort, the editorial staff\nof a journal dictates what gets\npublished and what doesn't.\nAnd the premier journals\nhave an outsized effect\non what the media covers.\nAnd so the beautiful thing\nis the journal staff now\nis of the age that they grew\nup hearing about acupuncture,\nhypnosis has a powerful\nclinical effect\nif it's done right, yoga\nnidra and similar practices.\nAnd so the tides are\nchanging, but I sometimes\nlike to take a step back and\nthink, what are we confronted\nwith now that seems crazy that\nin 10 years, the kids that\nwill be the-- because\nto me they're kids,\nwill be journal editors.\nI'm like, oh yeah, absolutely.\nI'm making this up but\nputting tuning forks\nagainst your head or\nsomething like that,\nlike sound wave therapy.\nI think when one\nadopts a stance of--\nwe have to filter everything\nthrough the limitations\nof our biology, but also\nthrough the sociology,\nthe way culture goes, it\nbecomes a different story.\nHow do you deal with that,\nnot just in terms of health,\nbut in terms of\nthinking about anything?\nIt sounds like you don't spend\na whole lot of time thinking\nabout what people are going\nto think is cool or not.\nRICK RUBIN: No, I can't.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You're\na punk rocker at heart.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You still\nare there, I got you.\nRICK RUBIN: I can't.\nI just know what I\nlike and what I don't.\nI know what works for\nme and what doesn't.\nI try things.\nAnd I'm constantly looking\nfor new better solutions\nto anything.\nAnd wherever they come\nfrom doesn't matter.\nIt could come from--\nit could come from\nStanford or it\ncould come from the guy talking\nto himself on the street.\nIf it works, I'm good.\nIt doesn't really\nmatter to me at all.\nI don't hold any of it tightly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nfortunately, there's\nnow a division of the\nNational Institutes\nof Health called complementary\nand alternative health.\nAnd it's amazing.\nNCCIH is run by a woman\nwho has published on--\nthis is interesting, some\nof the anti-cancer effects\nof things like acupuncture,\nnot that acupuncture\ncan cure all cancers, but\nreal data that I think\nfor a lot of people, certainly\nof the generation above us,\nthey just are not interested.\nIt sheds new light on the Andrew\nWiles, the Paul Stametses,\nthe wild ones.\nRICK RUBIN: Ozone therapy,\nthere are so many.\nThere's so many we can look at.\nI mean for a long\ntime, nutrition\nwas just thought of\nas something that\ndoesn't matter what you eat.\nIt's what medicine\nyou take and what--\nthe food is everything.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Food\nis a powerful variable.\nIn the landscape of\nonline nutrition,\nit's one of the third rails\nfor anyone like myself\nwho's out there on social media.\nYou do a very good\njob of putting out\nposts on Twitter and Instagram,\nbut each day you take it down,\nyou put up a new one.\nRICK RUBIN: And I\ndon't talk about any--\nI only talk about--\nI talk about creative ideas.\nI don't talk about\nanything specific\nrelated to anything other\nthan maybe something like,\ndon't believe what you hear.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIt's right, exactly.\nWell, in the landscape\nof nutrition sometimes\nI now place it\nthrough the filter\nof professional wrestling.\nYou've got your vegans,\nand your omnivores,\nand your carnivore MD.\nAnd you've got liver king.\nAnd you've got\neverything in between.\nSo you could translate that to\nany number of different areas.\nFashion probably has its people.\nI'm just not aware\nof who they are.\nMusic has theirs.\nAnd sports has theirs.\nAnd science has\ntheirs characters.\nSo are we all just\npro-wrestling characters\nin these different\ndomains and we're\ntaking ourselves and each\nother way too seriously?\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah, it's all--\nwe don't know anything.\nIf someone has an idea\nand it sounds interesting,\ndo you try it.\nAnd if it doesn't work, it's\nOK and try something else.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou're an empiricist.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah, whatever\nworks, whatever works.\nAnd if something seems\ninteresting to you\nand you're excited by\nit, why not try it?\nI try very fringy things.\nI like, in some ways,\nthe more unrealistic\nit seems, the more\ninteresting it is to me\nbecause I feel like that's\ngetting closer to something\nthat somebody doesn't\nwant me to know.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\nyou're not a big drug\nguy like the big psychedelic\ncraze that's happening now\nand that happened some years.\nRICK RUBIN: I'm not against it.\nIt's just has never been\nsomething that I've done.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, yeah, it's\nan interesting area\nthat's definitely\nmaking headway inside of\nstandard academic science\nand medicine now.\nRICK RUBIN: I'm interested in\nnon-pharmacological approaches\nto things, whatever they are.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I'm a\nbig believer that also that\nbehavioral do's\nand don'ts, first,\nare that they're the most fun\nto explore because, in general,\nunless it's something like\njumping between buildings,\ndoing parkour, or\nsomething, most of the time,\nyou're not going to\ninjure or harm yourself.\nThere's more room for\niteration than there\nis with a pill or a potion.\nAlthough, certainly,\npharmacology has its place.\nSo you've had creative\nworks certainly\nwithin the realm of music, also\ncomedy, and producing film,\nand other things.\nFor somebody out there\nwho, of whatever age,\nmaybe they're\ncreating, maybe they\nknow they have this creative\nantennae, the sources outside.\nWhat was it that Strummer said?\nI actually wrote this on\nthe wall of my laboratory.\nNo input no output.\nRICK RUBIN: Wow.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat Strummer's law.\nIt's written in my laboratory.\nThe people in my lab were\nlike, what's going on here?\nI think one guy\nknew what that was,\nbut it was a picture of him,\nand picture of my bull dog,\nand no input no output.\nI don't think I can just\nstay in a room with four\nwalls, and a ceiling, and\nnothing else and create.\nI mean, I know that there\nare certain number of things\nin here, but I do\nthink accessing\nthe world is important.\nRICK RUBIN: And the world is\ngiving us clues all the time.\nIf we're paying attention,\nthat's another part of it.\nIf you're paying attention, the\nthing that you are looking for\nis being either whispered\nor screamed at you\nin the outside world if\nyou're paying attention.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, I forget\nthe exact title of the chapter,\nbut there's a chapter\nabout staying open to clues\nor being on the\nlookout for clues.\nNow, I feel tempted to\nlook for the exact title\nof that chapter.\nRICK RUBIN: It's probably look\nfor clues is what I guess.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Look for clues\nsounds like it sounds right.\nAnd since you wrote it,\nI'm guessing that's right.\nRICK RUBIN: Well it's\nsomething like that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So do you think\nthere are clues in everywhere?\nRICK RUBIN: Yes, I think\nthere are clues everywhere.\nIf we pay attention,\nwe'll hear a phrase.\nIt'll trigger a thought.\nWe'll see something unexpected.\nIf someone recommends\nsomething to you,\nmaybe it's a coincidence.\nIf three people recommend\nthe same thing to you\nmaybe it's not, who knows?\nWho knows?\nI do believe the universe is\non the side of creativity.\nAnd the universe is\nsupporting things to happen.\nAnd they can happen\nthrough you or they could\nhappen through someone else.\nSo if you're paying attention,\nmaybe it'll happen through you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We had a\nguest on the podcast named\nJustin Sonnenburg.\nHe's an expert in\nthe gut microbiome.\nAnd he applied something\nthat-- without knowing,\nhe applied the\nopposite principle,\nthe opposite is true principle.\nWe were talking about these\ntrillions of gut microbiota\nthat clearly are doing\namazing things to create,\nneurotransmitters,\nand govern our brain,\nand even decision making, how\nmuch sugar is in our system\ndriving appetite, et cetera.\nAnd he said, we think\nof them as cargo,\nbut maybe we're just vehicles\nand they're in charge.\nThat all of our\ninteractions like\nevery time we shake\nhands or touch our eyes,\nwe're exchanging gut microbiota.\nAnd we think of intelligence\nas thinking and intelligence.\nAnd he's a microbiologist.\nAnd in all seriousness\nhe said, maybe\nwe're the ones\nbeing manipulated.\nWe're the house cats.\nAnd we think here we are,\nwe're falling in love,\nand kissing, and shaking hands,\nand washing hands, and doing\nall sorts of things to isolate\nor connect with one another.\nAnd maybe the gut\nmicrobiota are really\ntrying to optimize\ntheir survival.\nRICK RUBIN: That's what Laird\nHamilton said that at one point\nin the sauna--\nthat when you're in the\nsauna, it's really hot.\nThe feeling that you have\nof wanting to get out\ncould be the bad critters in\nyour body that can't handle it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Like\nlet's get out of here.\nRICK RUBIN: Are trying to\nconvince you, from the inside,\nto get out.\nMaybe that's where the feeling\nof being compelled to get out\ncomes from.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So Elon\ngetting us all to Mars\nmight be a bit of--\nmaybe they just\nwant to get to Mars.\nAnd so they're\nRICK RUBIN: Maybe.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBecause I'm starting\nto feel like I'm channeling\nLex Freedman here for a moment.\nNo, I think this considering\nthe opposite is really key.\nAnd while it might\nsound mystical\nto people or a little bit like\nwe're just playing with ideas,\nthat's exactly what\nyou do in science.\nSomeone walks in with a\nresult and says, I found this.\nThis is true.\nAnd you say, but what if\nit's all something else?\nA good example\nmight be-- here I'm\npulling from podcast\nepisodes that we've had.\nBut Alia Crum is this\namazing psychologist\nwho works on belief effects.\nYour knowledge strongly shapes\nthe physiological outcome.\nAnd she had this amazing\ngraduate thesis where she said,\nwhat if all of exercise\nis placebo, all of it?\nYeah, burn some calories\nand does some things.\nTurns out this isn't the case.\nBut it turns out a lot of\nthe effects of exercise,\npositive effects--\nlowering blood pressure,\nrelieving stress,\npositive are placebo\nbut nobody thinks\nof it like that\nbecause we're so attached to\ncalories burned, et cetera.\nRICK RUBIN: I think\nthat's a big point\nthat the belief part of it is\na huge part of the conversation\nabout everything.\nWhat we believe has power.\nIf we believe we can\nmake something great,\nthe chances of us\nmaking something great\nare better than if we\ndon't believe we can.\nSo I would say, any\nability to harness\nyour belief on your behalf is\na really healthy thing to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And one\nthing that you make very clear\nis that while our own abilities\nmay come into question\nfrom time to time,\nyou absolutely\nbelieve that the elements from\nwhich to create are out there.\nRICK RUBIN: Absolutely.\nAll the elements are here.\nEverything is here.\nWe get to pick and choose.\nWe get to-- the conveyor belts\ngoing by with the little gifts.\nAnd we can-- first, we have to\nnotice there's a conveyor belt.\nThen we notice the gifts.\nAnd then that's\nthe starting point.\nAnd then we may even\nfeel empowered enough\nto grab one of the\ngifts, and open it\nup, and see what's inside.\nAnd then maybe that started\nsomething really beautiful\nthat we wouldn't have done.\nEverything that I\nmake or have made\nhas always been based\non something that I see\nor hear that allows\nme to see something\nthat I didn't see before.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I was going\nto ask you whether or not,\nit's important to be\nhappy in order to create,\nbut certainly a lot of\npeople that were unhappy\nwere still able to create.\nBut the more I listen\nto you, it seems\nthat it's really about an\nability to pay attention.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I'm\nunhappy or if I'm happy\nmay not be as relevant\nas whether or not\nI'm able to stay undistracted.\nRICK RUBIN: Yes.\nI would say that's--\nI would say being able to stay\npresent in the work is probably\nthe most important part of it.\nAnd how you feel is less of\nan issue unless how you feel\ngets in the way of you feeling\nhow the work makes you feel.\nDo you know what I'm saying?\nIf you're in a lot of pain\nand you're looking at a piece\nof art, it may be hard to know\nhow that art makes you feel\nbecause you're--\nthe big signal in your\nbody is the physical pain.\nI'm sure there are some\npeople who can do that too,\nwho can, even through the\nphysical pain, can feel it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, there's\nthis idea of transmutation,\nof taking one emotion and\ncontorting it and co-opting it\ninto another action\nin an adaptive way.\nBut this idea of\ndistraction being a problem,\nthis really resonates, I think.\nWhen I think of times\nof great productivity\nis when I was able\nto be undistracted.\nI could also see how success\ncan be its own distraction.\nThis is often discussed in the\ncontext of fighting sports,\nwhere someone starts\nmaking a lot of money\nand pretty soon their focus\nbecomes all the things\nthey can access with\ntheir success as opposed\nto the thing that got them\nthere in the first place.\nKeeping an underdog mentality.\nRICK RUBIN: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nBefore we conclude,\nI do want to ask you about\none other aspect of process,\nwhich is meditation.\nMeditation is interesting\nto me because when\nwe close our eyes as\nmost meditations are done\nand we focus on our brain,\nour brain has no sensation.\nLike if we--\nRICK RUBIN: I wouldn't\nsay we focus on our brain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Or\nwe focus on something\nother than our normal\nexperience, is that--\nhow would you define meditation?\nRICK RUBIN: Well, there's\ndifferent-- there are\ndifferent types of meditation.\nEither way, I would say there\nis no form of meditation where\nwe're focused on our brain.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: OK, good.\nI'm glad we disagree.\nRICK RUBIN: I would say, here\nare the things that happen.\nWe either are engaging\nin a mantra, which\nwould be a version\nof almost creating\na trance for ourselves, not\nunlike listening to something\nwhen we go to sleep that would\ndistract our conscious mind\nfrom participating.\nWe would be overriding\nthe talking mind with just\na sound that we're\ngenerating, or a word,\nor phrase, a series of phrases.\nMeta meditation is a\nloving kindness meditation\nwith phrases,\ncould be that or it\ncould be focused on the breath.\nBut the purpose of being\nfocused on the breath\nis to not hear the self-talk\nthat we normally have.\nIt's a single pointed\nfocus exercise in those\nthat I described.\nThe other version is an\nawareness meditation,\nwhere you're closing your eyes.\nAnd you're being with\nwhatever is and noticing--\nso if we were to do it\nnow, and you could do it\neyes open or eyes closed\nwith an awareness practice.\nBut the first thing that I\nwould do is I would feel--\nI feel a little\nringing in my ears.\nIt might be from the\nelectronic equipment around us.\nAnd I don't mean that\nI hear the sound.\nIt's like a vibration.\nI hear cars passing\nin the distance.\nLet's see what else comes out, I\ncan feel a feeling in my chest.\nI can feel this part of my face.\nI'm not sure why.\nIt feels like it's\nrelated to my jaw.\nMore car sounds.\nI'm aware of a little\nfeeling of warmth.\nSo now, I would say the\nroom feels a bit warm.\nI wasn't aware of that before,\nwhen I wasn't just being\nwith what's happening.\nI feel a little itch\non my left shoulder.\nSo that would be an\nawareness practice,\nwhich is another kind of\nmeditation where you're just\npaying attention\nto what's going on.\nThere's no story.\nThere's no this means this.\nNone of those things.\nIt's like an inventory,\nalmost, of everything\nthat comes up when it comes up.\nAnd you do that for\na period of time.\nBut in all of those\ncases, in the example\nof doing the\nawareness meditation,\nor doing a mantra meditation,\nor focusing on the breath,\nin none of them am I thinking.\nAnd none of them am\nI concentrating on--\nI'm being aware of\nsense perceptions\nin the awareness one or\nin the other meditations.\nI'm doing a practice\nso that I'm not\naware of thinking\nabout anything else.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When\ndid you start meditating\nand how often do\nyou meditate now?\nRICK RUBIN: I learned\nwhen I was 14.\nAnd I started with TM.\nAnd that's probably\nthe meditation\nthat I've done the most in\nmy life and I come back to.\nAlthough I tried many\ndifferent kinds and also\ndifferent physical\nforms of meditation--\nTai Chi, things like that.\nI meditated for\nfive or six years.\nAnd then I stopped when I\nwent to school, to university.\nAnd then I started again\nseveral years later.\nAnd when I started again,\nI realized how profound\nit wasn't in me that I\nhad done it when I did it\nSo I usually have some\nsort of a practice.\nIn some ways, the beach walks\ncould be a form of meditation.\nBut for me, typically,\nI would wake up.\nIt'd be the first thing I would\ndo during that in-between time,\nmaybe go out in the\nsun, close my eyes,\nand meditate before\nstarting my day.\nIf I'm doing it twice\na day, the second time\nwould probably be\nright before dinner\nif I'm doing it on\na regular schedule.\nThen if I find myself\non an airplane,\nI might meditate for an hour.\nI can remember, one time,\nmeditating the entire flight\nfrom New York to LA, just\nwas a great opportunity\nto do a deep dive.\nAnd time passes.\nYou lose track of time.\nYou don't even know--\nit's like going to\nsleep and waking up.\nYou don't feel like\nthat was eight hours.\nIt's just time stops.\nNot always, but when it\ndoes, it's a great feeling.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, you've sent me\nsome meditations\nincluding the one that you\ndid on that transatlantic--\ntranscontinental flight.\nAnd I've been trying to get-- do\nlonger and longer meditations,\nbut I've always\nmeditated a little bit.\nBut your meditation practice is\none that I'm starting to adopt,\nmaybe we could\nconvince you to give us\na suggestions of one or two\nand we can link out to them\nfor listeners.\nI'm sure they'd appreciate.\nRICK RUBIN: And there's also\nmeditation like practices\nto do that involve--\nthere's something called\nthe surgical series\nfrom the Monroe Institute which\nI used when I had a surgery.\nYou listen to this recording.\nAnd it both allows your\nbody to heal much faster\nand remove some of the trauma\nthat goes on when getting cut\nopen-- it's traumatic.\nBut just through listening\nto certain things,\nyou can have a really powerful\neffect, heal much faster.\nI remember I was about to\nbe put under for a surgery.\nAnd my eyes were closed.\nAnd I wasn't\ncommunicating with anyone\nthere because I\nwas going inside.\nAnd my wife was with me.\nAnd they came in.\nAnd they said, oh, so they\nalready gave Rick the sedative\nbecause he's ready to go in.\nI don't think you\ngave him anything.\nHe's like, look at his numbers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I love it.\nYeah, it's an amazingly\npowerful practice\nthat I like because\nanyone can cultivate.\nRICK RUBIN:\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\nAnd there's no good\nor bad version.\nIt really is just--\nif you learn a technique and\nshow up and do it, it works.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI love that you're\nso willing to share what\nyou do in your process.\nListen, I just want to say thank\nyou for a number of things.\nI want to thank you for\nthe music you've created\nand that you are to\ncreate because we want\nto be still ongoing, certainly\nfor your time today in sharing\nyour thought process\nand a bit of what\ngoes into this incredible\ncreative process.\nAnd I want to thank you\nfor writing the book.\nI don't talk about or feature\nmany books on the podcast.\nIt's just not something\nwe typically do,\nbut I've seen a little bit\nof the evolution of it.\nAnd then I've seen it\nnow and read through it\nin its final form\ntwice, as I mentioned.\nAnd I'm going to continue\nto read through it again.\nIt is one of those books\nwhere it is so filled\nwith gems, like every chapter.\nI could take notes on this.\nAnd take notes on this.\nAnd it's assembled in a\nvery digestible way that\nallows people to extract\nthe meaningful parts\nin every chapter.\nAnd there are so many in a way\nthat's very straightforward.\nSo I love the book.\nSo thank you for doing\nit because you certainly\ndidn't have to write a book.\nBut I'm so happy that you did.\nAnd I know that I've\nalready benefited\nI know so many people\nare going to benefit.\nIt's an amazing book.\nAnd I couldn't help but put\nmy neuroscience lens on it.\nBut I also, about\nhalfway through,\nI learned to discard my\npre-existing lens a bit\nand start to see things\nthrough what I think\nis a different perspective.\nSo I just want to thank you for\nbeing such an incredible portal\nand also for being\nan amazing friend.\nRICK RUBIN: Thank you.\nI love you.\nI'm so happy to\nbe here with you.\nAnd any time I get to\nsee you, it's a good day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Likewise.\nThank you for joining
