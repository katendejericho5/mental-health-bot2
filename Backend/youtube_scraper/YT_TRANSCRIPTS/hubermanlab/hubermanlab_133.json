    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and Ophthalmology at\nStanford school of medicine today we are\ndiscussing supplements or more\nspecifically a rational guide to\nsupplementation now to be forthright I\nwant to tell you that I am not a fan of\nthe word supplements because it stems\nfrom this idea that all supplements are\nsomehow food supplements or designed to\ncompensate for what one could otherwise\nget from food and that's simply not the\ncase many supplements are compounds that\nare extremely efficacious for instance\nfor enhancing sleep or for enhancing\nhormone function or for enhancing focus\nand many of those compounds are simply\nnot found in food or are not found in\nenough abundance in food to have the\ndesired effect\nnow that raises the issue as to whether\nor not these compounds are good to take\nsafe to take and whether or not they are\nactually beneficial for us and the short\nanswer is that like everything else\nsupplements can either be good for us or\ndangerous for us depending on dosage\nsourcing Etc but more importantly we\nneed to think about supplements and a\nrational guide to supplementation as\ntaking into account a number of\ndifferent factors and we need to set\naside the idea that all non-prescription\ncompounds that fall under this umbrella\nterm supplements are simply things that\ncould be extracted from food but most\npeople don't either ingest enough of\nthose Foods or pay enough attention to\ntheir diet in order to obtain them in\nfact during today's episode I'm going to\ngive you a number of different very\nspecific questions that you can answer\nin order to decide whether or not you\nshould be taking any so-called\nsupplements or not and whether or not\nyou should be taking one type of\nsupplement or another type of supplement\nmore or less than the other I'm also\ngoing to discuss safety of course and I\nwill discuss cost because obviously\nmonetary cost is a serious consideration\nfor most if not everybody considering\nthe use of supplements during today's\nepisode I will also discuss which\nspecific supplements are optimal for\nachieving specific endpoints such as\nimproved sleep such as improved focus\nand such as improved hormone function\namong other things I plan to cover the\nfull range of what I referred to as\nsupplements including so-called\nfoundational supplements that are\ndesigned to act as a sort of insurance\npolicy against any deficiencies that\nmight exist within your diet all the way\nup to very targeted outcome supplements\nand compounds that is compounds that are\nnon-prescription that are designed to\nachieve very specific endpoints such as\nenhanced Focus over the next four to six\nhours of physical work or mental work so\non and so forth\nplan to cover everything in between that\nas well and I promise to cover how\nsupplements interact with other things\nsuch as behavioral tools prescription\ndrugs when supplements might be a good\nalternative to prescription drugs when\nthey might not be a good alternative to\nprescription drugs when supplements can\nserve as an augment to already excellent\nnutrition and prescription protocols and\nevery feature of supplements as it\nrelates to mental health physical health\nand performance by the end of today's\nepisode you should be armed with a\nnumber of different questions as I\nmentioned before that will allow you to\ndevelop the most biologically effective\nand cost-effective supplement regimen\nfor you and of course I want to\nacknowledge that for some people the\ntotal amount or dosages of a given\nsupplement were supplements that you\nmight need to take could be zero there\nare such individuals but that many\npeople can in fact arrive tremendous\nbenefit from supplements in a way that\ncan be more cost effective than trying\nto obtain the same non-prescription\nnutrients from food as we head into\ntoday's conversation I want to emphasize\nsomething very important not just as it\nrelates to supplements but as it relates\nto all aspects of mental health physical\nhealth and performance and that is I\ntake the stance that behavioral tools\nthat is specific actions that we take\nand specific actions that we avoid form\nthe foundation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance so things like\nviewing morning sunlight and exercise\nare behavioral tools they don't require\nthe ingestion of anything within the\nrealm of Behavioral tools there are also\nsome don'ts or do not that can greatly\nenhance our mental health physical\nhealth and performance such as avoiding\nbright light exposure to your eyes\nbetween the hours of 10 pm and 4 AM or\navoiding caffeine too late in the\nafternoon because even if you can fall\nasleep after ingesting caffeine in the\nlate afternoon we know it disrupts the\narchitecture of your sleep in ways that\ngreatly diminish your mental health\nphysical health and performance the\nfollowing day for instance so behavioral\ntools form the foundational layer of all\ntools for mental health physical health\nand performance second to that I would\nsay the next layer is in fact nutrition\nno amount of supplementation or\nnon-prescription compounds or\nprescription compounds for that matter\ncan never compensate for poor nutrition\nat least not for very long okay so this\nis a key Point even though many\nsupplements are not simply food\nsupplements because they are not\ndesigned to compensate for anything that\nyou could otherwise get from food that\nis not to say that you can live on\nsupplements you know I suppose you could\nlive on whey protein and fish oil\ncapsules and vitamin capsules or tablets\nfor a short while but before long you'd\neither suffer from boredom to the extent\nthat you'd want to go back to food or\nsome other deficiency would show up I\nthink it's the rare individual that\ntries to survive entirely on food\nsupplements and things of that sort most\neverybody and I would hope everybody is\npaying attention to their nutrition so I\nwould Place behavioral tools do's and do\nNots as layer one the deepest layer the\nBedrock of all mental health physical\nhealth and performance\non top of that I would Place nutrition\nand of course that's going to mean\ndifferent things to different people\nwith the understanding that there's a\nhuge array of different food choices and\nnutritional programs\nnutrition is fundamentally important for\nmacronutrients for storage of energy in\nthe form of glycogen fats and\nphosphocratine stores and so forth but\nalso for obtaining basic nutrients\nvitamins minerals and micronutrients\nOkay so we've got behavioral tools\nnutritional tools then on top of that I\nwould place what is typically called\nsupplementation although today I'm\ntrying to expand that word to include\nnot just things that compensate for food\ndeficiencies or that are layered on top\nof food as a way to enhance the amount\nof nutrients that you could get from\nfood but as I mentioned before\ncompounds that are non-prescription that\ncan be for a variety of different\npurposes and many of which are not\navailable in food so I would place\nsupplementation right on top of\nnutrition then past that I would say\nprescription drugs obviously prescribed\nfrom a board-certified MD can serve a\nvery vital purpose in the treatment or\naugmentation of mental health physical\nhealth and performance goals so some\npeople do in fact need prescription\nantidepressants other people do not some\npeople do in fact need prescription\ndrugs for attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder or sleep Related\nDisorders so on and so forth\nthe whole issue of whether or not there\nis an over prescription epidemic or not\num is a separate conversation for a\nseparate podcast I would argue that many\nprescription drugs do in fact save lives\nthis includes the category of\nprescription drugs related to statins\nand cardiovascular health related to any\nnumber of different things even sleep\ndisorders and insomnia narcolepsy and so\nforth\nthat said there are many instances in\nwhich people can either reduce their\ndosages of prescription compounds or can\nreplace those prescription compounds\nwith quality behavioral tools nutrition\nand supplementation but there are many\ninstances in which prescription drugs\nare the only route by which people can\nachieve the mental health physical\nhealth and performance goals that they\nwish to achieve so I would place that as\nthe fourth layer in this stack of layers\ndirected towards mental health physical\nhealth and performance so just to list\noff again I fundamentally believe that\nbehaviors do's and do Nots form the\nfoundation of mental health physical\nhealth performance and next in line\nwould be nutrition\nthat is the specific Foods we eat the\namount that we eat the combinations of\nfoods that we eat in a given sitting and\nthe timing in which we eat our food then\non top of that I would Place\nsupplementation the topic of today's\nepisode and finally prescription drugs\nand of course all of these things\ninteract in important and interesting\nways many of which interactions we will\ndiscuss during today's podcast as we\ndrill into the topic of supplementation\ndeveloping a rational supplementation\nprotocol and one that is most\nbiologically and cost effective before\nmoving further into today's episode I\nwant to emphasize a very important point\nwhich is that I am not a physician that\nis I'm not a clinician so I do not\nprescribe anything nor am I going to do\nthat today I'm a professor I review the\nresearch literature I describe tools\ngleaned from the research literature and\ndeveloped from the research literature\nso I profess many things but I do not\nprescribe anything and I think it's\nvitally important that anytime you are\nthinking of adding or subtracting any\nbehavioral protocols nutritional\nprotocols supplementation based\nprotocols and certainly prescription\ndrug based protocols\nfor whatever purpose that you consult a\ntrusted board-certified physician that's\nabsolutely essential I don't say that\nmerely to protect me I mainly say that\nto protect you the most important aspect\nof today's episode is not going to be\nthat you discover one particular\nsupplement or category of supplements or\nblend of supplements that is going to\ntransform your mental health physical\nhealth and performance\nno the purpose of today's episode is for\nyou to understand where you have needs\nthat can be met by supplementation\nbetter than any other approach and most\nimportantly how to think about\nsupplementation that is how to think\nabout the different categories of\nsupplements that are out there and how\nthose interact with your nutrition and\nyour behaviors so that you can maximize\nyour immediate and long-term health\nwhat I mean by this is that we have this\nword supplements or supplementation but\nthat means many many different things it\nmeans vitamins it means minerals it\nmeans adaptogens most people probably\ndon't even know what an adaptogen really\nis and in fact many people talking about\nadaptogens never actually Define what an\nadaptogen is or designed for or the fact\nthat many adaptogens are also used for\nother purposes so today's discussion is\nreally about you learning how to think\nabout supplementation the same way you\nwould learn to think about nutrition or\nexercise or anything related to brain\nand body health for that matter in a way\nthat lets you navigate this vast space\nthat we call supplementation and develop\nprotocols that are optimal for you and\nindeed it may be the case that the ideal\ndosage of a given supplement for you is\nzero milligrams for instance if I ask\nyou are you sleeping deeply and enough\neach night do you feel rested throughout\nthe day maybe you need a short nap and\nthat's it or maybe you don't and you say\nyes I feel great I sleep great I wake up\nfeeling great I only need a short nap or\nno nap during the day to feel rested\nthroughout the day well then there's\nreally no discussion about sleep\nsupplementation to be had between you\nand me however\nif you are not sleeping well then a big\ndiscussion opens up as to what the\nreasons are as it relate to nutrition or\nwhen you're exercising or ingesting\ncaffeine in other words no discussion\nabout supplementation can be had in a\nvacuum\nrather discussions about supplementation\nneed to be considered in a larger\ncontext so today you're going to learn\nhow to place the discussion and thinking\nabout supplementation in a larger\ncontext and think about how specific\nsupplements that is specific ingredients\nand combinations of ingredients can\nindeed be used to buffer and support\nyour overall health and lead you to\nspecific health and performance outcomes\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the general public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is momentous momentous\nmakes supplements of the absolute\nhighest quality the huberman Lab podcast\nhas decided to partner with momentous\nbecause of the extremely high quality of\nmomentous supplements and because they\nhave single ingredient formulations as\nwe'll discuss more on today's episode\nsingle ingredient formulations are\nessential for most all aspects effects\nof developing a rational highly\nefficacious supplement regimen and\nthat's because the ideal supplement\nregimen allows you to adjust the dosages\nof individual ingredients as well as\nalternate days in which specific\ningredients are consumed it also allows\nyou for instance to assess whether or\nnot one given ingredient works for you\nand another ingredient does not and it\nalso allows you to assess whether or not\nany side effects originate from a\nspecific component of your supplement\nprotocol another advantage of momentous\nsupplements is that they ship anywhere\nin the world because we realize that\nmany of you reside outside of the United\nStates if you'd like to try any of the\nsupplements mentioned in today's or\nother episodes of The huberman Lab\npodcast so for instance things related\nto sleep augmentation hormone\naugmentation enhancing Focus metabolic\nhealth or otherwise you can go to live\nmomentous spelled ous so\nlivemomentis.com huberman and you'll get\n20 off any of their products today's\nepisode is also brought To Us by element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means plenty of sodium\nmagnesium and potassium the so-called\nelectrolytes and no sugar getting\nsufficient hydration and electrolytes is\nkey to brain health and body health and\nthat's because every cell in your brain\nand body relies on having enough\nelectrolytes available in order to\nfunction this is especially true of the\nso-called neurons or nerve cells in your\nbrain they actually require sufficient\namounts of sodium and potassium and\nmagnesium but especially sodium and\npotassium available to them in order to\nfire what are called Action potentials\nor electrical signals that's what allows\nyou to think to feel to move what gives\nyou energy so on and so forth so when\nyou are dehydrated oftentimes you will\nneed to get electrolytes and that's true\nif you're exercising a lot or if you\nsweat a lot but for many people it's\njust true because they're not consuming\nenough water and electrolytes in the\nform of liquids and Foods throughout the\nday element contains a science back\nelectrolyte ratio of 1 000 milligrams of\nsodium 200 milligrams of

sleeping\non a helix mattress for close to two\nyears now and it's the best sleep that\nI've ever had one of the reasons is the\nmattress is customized to you so you\nsimply go to the Helix site you take a\nbrief two minute quiz it asks you\nquestions like you tend to sleep on your\nback your side of your stomach or maybe\nall of those across the night or maybe\nyou don't know you tend to run hot\nduring the night or cold during the\nnight or maybe you don't know and they\nmatch you to the ideal mattress for you\nfor me it was the dusk dusk mattress\nthat allowed me to achieve the best\nsleep of my life if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress you can go to\nhelixsleep.com huberman take their brief\ntwo minute sleep quiz and they'll match\nyou to a customized mattress

three they'll even\npick it up for you if you don't love the\nmattress although I think you absolutely\nwill again if you're interested you can\ngo to Helix sleep.com huberman to get up\nto 200 off and two free pillows let's\ntalk about supplements and\nsupplementation and how to develop a\nrational supplementation regimen one of\nthe things that's really emerged over\nthe last 20 years is that supplements\nand there I'm referring to\nnon-prescription compounds designed to\naugment nutrition prescription drugs and\nbehavioral protocols\nhave emerged as a Mainstay within the\nhealth and wellness but also the medical\ncommunities that are focused on\ndeveloping mental health physical health\nand performance for their patients and\ntheir athletes and for the everyday\nperson essentially what I'm saying is\nthat 20 years ago a discussion about\nsupplements would mainly take place\nwithin the niche communities of health\nfood stores or particular athletes but\nnowadays I think almost everyone is\nfamiliar with the fact that yes indeed\nthere are standard vitamin supplements\nbut that there are also supplements such\nas Vitamin D3 which are designed to make\nsure that people have certain amounts of\nhormones in their bloodstream because\nthey might not be getting enough\nSunshine although I'll be very clear\nover and over throughout this episode\nthat there is no pill replacement for\nSunshine nor is there a pill replacement\nor food replacement for that matter for\nexercise or for social connection or for\nsleep or for simply getting smarter\nagain there is no pill that's going to\nreplace excellent behavioral protocols\nin fact a physician friend of mine has a\ngreat saying that I think everybody\nshould keep in mind\nas we wade into this conversation which\nis that Better Living Through Chemistry\nstill requires Better Living\nI think that's a very important phrase\nto keep in mind when thinking about the\noptimal supplementation or prescription\ndrug protocol for you so what is an\nideal supplementation protocol well I\nthink what we need to do is to take a\nstep back and ask what are different\nsupplements designed to do for instance\nthere are foundational supplements these\nare supplements that are designed to\nestablish a foundation or provide\nInsurance along with your nutritional\nintake to ensure that you're getting all\nthe things that you need in order to\nhave a basic level of mental health\nphysical health and opportunity for\nOptimal Performance now this is the one\ncategory of supplements for which I\nthink it's appropriate and in fact\nadvantageous to have multiple\ningredients in a given supplement\nthroughout the rest of today's\ndiscussion I'm going to talk about the\nadvantage of mainly focusing on taking\nsingle ingredient formulations for a\nvariety of reasons but when it comes to\nfoundational supplements\nwhat we're mainly talking about are\nsupplements that contain vitamins and\nminerals that are designed to compensate\nfor any deficiencies you might have from\ndiet or from lack of adequate diet how\nwould such a lack of vitamin and mineral\nintake arise well for instance if you're\nsomebody that practices intermittent\nfasting or other components of fasting\nor if you're somebody who does not get\nenough vitamins and minerals from\nvegetables and fruits and Grains and\nmeats well then taking a supplement that\ncan\nact as a insurance policy against any\nvitamin mineral deficiencies in many\nways can be advantageous although I will\ntalk about some of the safety concerns\nin just a few minutes now I want to\nacknowledge that as soon as we talk\nabout vitamin mineral supplements the\nSkeptics immediately raise their hands\nand say well all that vitamin and\nmineral supplements do is give you very\nexpensive urine and there the Skeptics\nare referring to the fact the reality\nthat when you ingest high levels of\nwater-soluble vitamins so think vitamin\nC and some of the other vitamins that\nindeed you will excrete them in your\nurine\nhowever\nit's also the case that many people are\nnot getting enough of the water-soluble\nvitamins from their foods and it's also\nthe case that many people are and it's\nalso the case that ingesting higher than\nneeded amounts of most water-soluble\nvitamins provided those levels aren't\nexceedingly High\nis or at least we should say can be safe\nand again this is provided that the\nlevels that they're ingesting are not\nexceedingly high so the typical vitamin\nmineral supplement is indeed going to\ncover any gaps or deficiencies that\nmight arise in the water-soluble\nvitamins from your food intake but the\nreality is that most people are getting\nenough of the water-soluble vitamins\nfrom their food if they are paying\nattention to a couple of things\nand those things are very simple to lay\nout regardless of whether or not you're\na vegan a vegetarian a more traditional\nomnivore eating from both animal-based\nand plant-based sources grains Etc or\neven if you're in the pure carnivore or\nstrict I guess it's called The Lion diet\nwhere it's just meat and salt regardless\nof what type of nutrition you follow you\nwill get vitamins and minerals but\nyou'll get more or fewer of them\ndepending on the nutritional program you\nfollow and of course depending on how\noften and how much you eat that's just\nsort of obvious\nmost people who take a vitamin mineral\nsupplement\nwill indeed excrete a lot of the\nwater-soluble vitamins they will retain\nthe fat soluble vitamins and there again\nthe Skeptics will raise their hands and\nsay you do not want to take high levels\nof fat soluble vitamins because they\nwill be stored in your system\npotentially to levels that are dangerous\nagain provided that vitamin mineral\nsupplements are not taken in excess it's\nunlikely that you're going to have such\na buildup of the fat soluble vitamins in\nyour system that they're going to be a\nproblem so that raises a very specific\nquestion that you need to ask do you\nwant to take a vitamin mineral\nsupplement well the answer to that will\nbe highly individual but you really just\nneed to address two things first of all\nis the cost within the range that you\ncan afford and want to pay right\noftentimes these vitamin mineral\nsupplements can be quite inexpensive but\nsome of them can be quite expensive and\nyou can see the full range of ones that\nare pennies per day all the way up to\nmany dollars or tens of dollars per day\nbecause of what are reported to be\nvariations in quality and sourcing and\nso forth I'm not aware of any real\ndifferences between the quality of the\nwater soluble and fat soluble vitamins\nfound in the less expensive versus the\nmore expensive vitamin mineral\nsupplements more typically the cost\nscales with the dosages of these\ndifferent vitamins and minerals and as\ncould probably be expected the more\nexpensive to obtain and source\nvitamins and minerals tend to be in\nlower quantities in the less expensive\nversions of vitamin mineral supplements\nthat's just kind of obvious so you need\nto ask yourself can you afford it\nfinancially and then you need to ask\nyourself are you able to regularly\ningest enough foods with enough variety\nto cover your vitamin mineral\nneeds just from food and for some people\nthe answer is going to be an immediate\nyes they are careful to get enough of\nthe foods that allow them to obtain\ntheir vitamin and mineral quota and for\nother individuals the answer will be no\nI would say for people that are\nextremely physically and or mentally\nactive and for people that perhaps are\nfollowing a intermittent fasting\nschedule so they are not ingesting a lot\nof food in general or restricting their\nfood intake to specific times of day\nwell then a vitamin mineral supplement\nlikely makes sense for them however it's\ngoing to be very important to ingest\nthat vitamin mineral supplement with\nfood and ideally early in the day so\nthat can set up a little bit of a\nchallenge for the intermittent fasters\nwho are restricting their feeding window\nto late in the day why do I say this\nwell many of the water-soluble vitamins\nin particular the B vitamins need to be\ningested with food because otherwise\nthey can cause some stomach upset and\nagain there's a range there some people\nlike myself can take B vitamins on an\nempty stomach and feel fine other people\nfeel really lousy when they take B\nvitamins there are a few other things\nthat we'll talk about later namely zinc\nand coenzyme Q10 that really should also\nbe taken with food but the best time to\ntake a vitamin mineral supplement is\nwith food and I believe that if you're\ngoing to take a vitamin mineral\nsupplement\nthat you want to take it with food and\nyou don't want to take dosages of\nvitamins and minerals from supplements\nthat are exceedingly high for a couple\nof reasons one is the buildup of fat\nsoluble vitamins that we talked about\nbefore the other reason is that when\npeople tend to take very high levels of\nvitamins and minerals from supplements\nthey tend to spend less time and focus\non making sure that they're optimizing\ntheir nutrition or at least trying to\nget their nutrition right what do I mean\nby getting their nutrition right well I\nthink regardless of whether or not your\nketo omnivore carnivore\nvegan or any other nutritional plan\nthe key thing is to get most that is\nabout 75 to 80 of your Foods or more\nfrom non-processed or minimally\nprocessed sources I think there is\nagreement across the board that most\npeople should avoid highly processed\nfoods highly processed foods are going\nto be foods with very long ingredient\nlists that have very long shelf lives so\nthis often includes snack foods it does\ninclude snack foods like chips Etc\npastries that could sit on the Shelf a\nlong time\nbut it also includes things like canned\nsoups and number of different other\nfoods that have many many ingredients\npreservatives most people would do well\nto avoid those kinds of foods and focus\nmost of their intake on things that are\nnon-processed so these would be things\nlike fruits and vegetables you'll notice\nthat the non-processed foods will tend\nto have very short shelf life or require\nrefrigeration in some cases such as meat\neggs Etc\nor minimally processed foods such as you\nknow rice and oatmeals and pastas beans\nand things of that sort beans oftentimes\ncan be completely unprocessed as well of\ncourse these are two general categories\nunprocessed and minimally process that\nshould make up about 80 or more of your\nfood intake if your goal is health and\nobtaining adequate amounts of vitamins\nand minerals the so-called foundational\nsupplements include of course vitamin\nand mineral supplements\nbut has expanded over the last decade or\nmore to also include supplements that\nhave vitamins and minerals but also\nthings like digestive enzymes and again\nhere we have an example where indeed you\ncan get digestive enzymes from foods for\ninstance eating a bit of papaya or even\na little bit of Pineapple can\nassist in the digestion of certain\naspects of macronutrients because these\nare naturally occurring enzymes that\nhelp digest things like carbohydrates\nfats and proteins\nand there are other food-based sources\nof enzymes you're welcome to look those\nup online if you just put food based\nsources of enzymes and you'll find those\nbut nowadays A lot of the foundational\nsupplements will include\npapain or they will include different\nlipases or anytime you hear the word Ace\nby the way it means an enzyme an enzyme\nis designed to break down or to catalyze\nsome sort of reaction in biology and\nnutrition in particular so you can find\nfoundational supplements that include\nvitamins and minerals and digestive\nenzymes and nowadays more and more the\nquality foundational supplements are\nalso including things like adaptogens\nand here the name adaptogens is sort of\nvague and it indeed has no specific\noperational definition this is something\nreally important to understand about\nsupplementation is that companies and\nindeed podcasts can talk about\nadaptogens without actually defining\nwhat an adaptogen is\nin an operational way when we say\noperational what we mean is a definition\nthat everyone in a given Arena or space\nresearch for instance can agree on so\nthat when we talk about the adaptogenic\neffects of a given compound we're all\ntalking about the same things well\nfoundational supplements nowadays\ninclude vitamins minerals digestive\nenzymes and the so-called adaptogens and\nthe adaptogens broadly speaking are\nthought to improve the body and brain's\nability ability to buffer against\nvarious stressors so these could be\nthings like herbs like ashwagandha that\nare designed to reduce cortisol levels\nin that sense ashwagandha is an\nadaptogen but ashwagandha has other\neffects related to hormone augmentation\nin both the testosterone and estrogen\nand maybe even the thyroid Pathways\nwe'll talk about this a little bit later\nwhen we talk about supplements for\nhormone augmentation so foundational\nsupplements has really expanded to\ninclude a lot of different categories of\nnutrients and micronutrients vitamins\nand minerals digestive enzymes designed\nto achieve a broad spectrum of effects\nagain this is the one category of\nsupplementation where I think it makes\nsense to explore\nmulti-ingredient formulations and the\nother thing that's often included in\nthese so-called foundational supplements\nare probiotics or prebiotics\nwhich are designed to augment and\nsupport the so-called gut microbiome the\ngut microbiome is the collection of\ntrillions of little micro bacteria that\nexist in all of us they mainly exist in\nthe mucous membrane-lined tissues of the\nbody so that would be your nasal\npassages your mouth\nthe vagina the urethra and the gut the\nwhole way from your mouth all the way\nout the other end so not just your\nstomach trillions of bacteria live there\ntrillions of microbacteria also live on\nyour skin in fact every time you shake\nsomeone's hand you're exchanging\nmicrobacteria\nthese micro bacteria often are healthy\nfor us good for us they support a huge\nnumber of positive biological functions\nbut there are other microbacteria that\nlive in our gut and Elsewhere on those\nmucous line tissues that can be\ndisadvantageous for us that can harm our\nhealth a growing idea these days based\non a number of different Laboratories\nwork including the laboratory of my\nupstairs neighbor at Stanford Dr Justin\nSonnenberg who's been a guest on this\npodcast is that having a great diversity\na range of microbiota as they're called\nmicrobiome microbiota and these\nmicrobacteria are all essentially\nreferring to the same thing the\nmicrobiome is the whole collection of\nthese microbacteria but having a lot of\ndifferent so-called species of these\nmicrobacteria is known to be\nadvantageous for immune system function\nhormone function it supports the\nso-called gut brain axis that's\nimportant for a number of things\nincluding mood and motivation actually\nsupports the production of\nneurotransmitters in the brain and body\nthat can help keep you motivated\nelevated mood\nsupport the general function of neurons\nwell not surprisingly there are ways to\nsupport the gut microbiome and there are\nways to harm the gut microbiome I'll\nrefer to to the podcast episode we did\nwith Justin Sonnenberg you can find that\nat hubermanlab.com if you want to learn\nall the different ways you can support\nyour gut microbiome but for sake of\ntoday's discussion I want to emphasize\nthat some of those methods of supporting\nthe gut microbiome are through the\ndirect consumption of particular foods\nand there are two categories of foods\nthat if you're getting enough of them\nit's likely that your gut microbiome is\ndiverse and is going to support all\nthose important functions I just listed\noff and other functions as well the two\nsources of gut microbiota supporting\nfoods are low sugar fermented foods so\nthese would be things like sauerkraut\nkimchi\nGreek yogurt again low sugar Greek\nyogurt\num\nkombucha in particular as a drink things\nlike kefir there are a bunch of other\nvarieties of fermented foods different\ncultures have different fermented foods\nso Japanese natto is um another source\nof of ferment that is very good for the\ngut microbiome and work from Justin\nsonnenberg's lab and close by Labs at\nStanford School of Medicine have shown\nthat\nif people ingest\nfour servings a day of these low sugar\nfermented foods it greatly improves the\nfunction of the gut microbiome and in\nparticular enhances the function of the\nimmune system and it reduces the\nso-called inflammatorium it reduces\ninflammation in the brain and body in\nthe ways that are helpful and effective\nfor brain and body that is mental health\nphysical health and performance so there\nare ways to support your gut microbiome\nstrictly from food but it should come as\nno surprise that most people are not\ningesting four servings a day of\nfermented foods hopefully they're\ngetting enough fiber\nespecially Prebiotic fiber which is one\nother way to support the gut microbiome\nalthough the studies from Justin\nsonnenberg's lab point to the fact that\nfiber intake itself was not directly\nsupportive of the gut microbiome in\neverybody it was in some individuals but\nnot in others and some had no effect and\nin other individuals it actually made\nthe\ncategory or I should say the array of\ninflammatory markers worse it actually\nled to more inflammation so that's not\nto say that fiber is bad in fact in the\nepisode that we did with Dr Lane Norton\nhe discussed the many benefits of\ngetting enough fiber there are a lot of\nreasons why people should get enough\nfiber in their diet but at least for\nsupporting the gut microbiome\nfour servings a day of low sugar\nfermented foods\nseems to be the best way to support the\ngut microbiome through the intake of\nnutrition again most people are not\nachieving that and therefore these\nfoundational supplements that can be\njust vitamin and mineral supplements or\nit could be vitamin and mineral\nsupplements plus digestive enzymes or\nboth of those things plus adaptogens now\nalso tend to include prebiotics and\nprobiotics that are designed to support\nthe proliferation and maintenance of\nenough gut microbiota in order to\nsupport the gut microbiome and the gut\nbrain axis now because of the importance\nof the gut microbiome and because most\npeople are not getting enough support\nfor the gut microbiome in the form of\nlow sugar fermented foods and Prebiotic\nfiber from their diet\nI think perhaps one of the most\nessential foundational supplements\nirrespective of whether or not it\nincludes vitamins and minerals\nadaptogens and digestive enzymes is some\nway to support the gut microbiome now\nthis gets into a whole dimension of\nof categories of Prebiotic and probiotic\ncapsules and one needs to be very\ncareful there I do want to say that most\nof the Prebiotic and probiotic capsules\nthat you can buy first of all are very\nexpensive the best ones are going to be\nrefrigerated or required Refrigeration\njust as do any good low sugar fermented\nfoods by the way so for instance pickles\nare a low sugar fermented food that can\nsupport the gut microbiome but if you're\nbuying pickles from the section of the\ngrocery store where they the pickles are\nnot\nrefrigerated well then you're not going\nto get the gut microbiome supporting\neffects from those pickles it's so funny\nwe're even having this conversation\ntalking about pickles but the reality is\nthey can greatly enhance the microbiota\nif you are getting the pickles that are\nand require refrigeration and include\nthe brine which is the the liquid around\nthem the same is true for sauerkraut\nnon-refrigerated sauerkraut is not going\nto support your gut microbiome it will\nsupply some other things perhaps but\nit's not going to support your gut\nmicrobiome it has to be the refrigerated\nversions for the reason that most people\nare not getting enough food based\nsupport for the gut microbiome and\nbecause of the importance of the gut\nmicrobiome one of the key categories of\nfoundational supplements are supplements\nthat create\nsupport for the microbiome through\nprebiotics or probiotics again they tend\nto be the refrigerated varieties are the\nones that are actually going to work\nthose also tend to be very expensive\nand there are some evidence that taking\nexcessive amounts of prebiotics and\nprobiotics that is typical of these\ncapsule forms of prebiotics and\nprobiotics if they're taken ongoing not\nfor short periods of time but if they're\ntaken ongoing can lead to some issues\nlike brain fog there's a nice literature\non this that and a growing one at that\nso my suggestion is that if people are\ngoing to take supplements to support the\nmicrobiome that those supplements\ninclude low enough levels that is small\nenough amounts of prebiotics and\nprobiotics that you don't start to\nventure into the realm of brain fog and\nsome of the other issues that could be\nassociated with taking too much\nPrebiotic and probiotic in the form of\nsupplements I'd like to take a brief\nbreak and thank our sponsor inside\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA to help you\nbetter understand your body and help you\nreach your health goals I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\nanalyzed from a quality blood test the\nproblem with a lot of blood and DNA\ntests out there however is that you get\ndata back about metabolic factors lipids\nand hormones and so forth but you don't\nknow what to do with those data inside\ntracker solves that problem and makes it\nvery easy for you to understand what\nsorts of nutritional behavioral maybe\neven supplementation based interventions\nyou might want to take on in order to\nadjust the numbers of those metabolic\nfactors hormones lipids and other things\nthat impact your immediate and long-term\nHealth to bring those numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate and indeed\noptimal for you if you'd like to try\ninside tracker you can visit inside\ntracker.com huberman and get 20 off any\nof inside tracker's plans that's inside\ntracker.com huberman to get 20 off the\nother category foundational supplements\nare those adaptogens that we mentioned\nearlier adaptogens again being a very\npoorly defined category but these are\ntypically\nmicronutrients herbs sometimes they go\ninto the mushroom category again these\nare non psychedelic mushrooms that\nprovide either some buffering to the\nstress system by reducing cortisol\ntypically or that are thought to or\nknown to based on research studies to\nenhance things like blood flow to the\nbrain or to enhance some aspect of\ncognitive function by way of enhancing\nneurotransmitter function\nthis category of so-called adaptogens is\nan important one we'll get back to this\na little bit later the reason I mention\nit now is that it is indeed hard to get\nthe so-called adaptogens in sufficient\nconcentrations from food-based sources I\nhave to assume that most people aren't\nout there collecting chaga mushroom or\nthe ashwagandha herbs and then combining\nthem with their salads or their foods\nand so that's why this adaptogen\ncategory fits into foundational now this\nopens up the category of foundational\nsupplements that are broad spectrum that\nis that include vitamins and minerals\nthat have digestive enzymes that have\nadaptogens and that also have prebiotics\nand probiotics at the appropriate\ndosages this is one reason why I'm a big\nfan of supplements like athletic greens\nwhich is as many of you know a sponsor\nof this podcast and does really nicely\ncover all of these categories of\nfoundational nutrition but I do want to\nemphasize that this is not a way to\nfocus on athletic greens specifically\nthere are other categories and brands of\nexcellent foundational nutritional\nsupplements that cover these categories\nof vitamins and minerals probiotics\nprebiotics digestive enzymes and\nadaptogens it just so happens that that\nathletic greens is the one that I\ndiscovered and that works best for me\nand that many people find works really\nwell for them so this is why when people\napproach me and they ask me as they\noften do very very often do I should say\nif I'm only going to take one supplement\nwhat supplement should I take rather\nthan just give them one specific answer\nI actually asked them three questions\nfirst question I ask them is how well\nare you sleeping at night are you\ngetting enough sleep are you waking up\nfeeling rested because if they're not\nthat opens up a whole different set of\ninteractions that we need to have and\ndiscussions around what sorts of things\nthey need to do and possibly take in\norder to get their sleep right because\nsleep is the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance we will\nhave that discussion a little bit later\nin this episode\nthe second question I asked them is\nhow's your nutrition that is are you\neating regularly have you found the\ncombination of macronutrients or which\ndiet is right for you do you think\nyou're getting enough vitamins and\nminerals how's your digestion we have\nthat conversation and then the third\nthing that I ask which is extremely\nimportant is what's your budget because\nif somebody has ten dollars a month\ntotal to spend on supplements versus a\nthousand dollars a month to spend on\nsupplements total well then there's a\ndifferent set of conversations to be had\nas to which supplements they should take\nnow once those three questions have been\nanswered\nassuming that somebody is able to spend\nabout a hundred dollars or more on\nsupplements per month\nthen my recommendation is that they not\nfocus on any specific supplements\ndirected towards sleep or toward Focus\nor hormone augmentation but rather that\nthey focus on buffering and enhancing\ntheir foundational nutrition adaptogens\nprobiotics prebiotics and digestive\nenzymes because of the simple fact that\nif they do that they're going to raise\nthe tide on all the biological and organ\nsystems that are going to lead to\nenhanced mental health physical health\nand performance including sleep\nso this is one reason why if people say\nwell if I can only take one supplement\nwhat should I take I say well what's\nyour budget if they say they can meet\nthat hundred dollar threshold per month\nthen my recommendation would be athletic\ngreens or something like it or that they\ninvest the time and energy to go find\nthe various combinations of vitamins and\nminerals and probiotics and prebiotics\nand adaptogens and so forth in\nindividual\ncomponents that they can then take in\ncombination in order to meet their\nfoundational needs but most people are\nnot interested in doing all that\nhomework and legwork to figure out\nexactly what those dosages are that's\none reason why indeed I have taken\nathletic green since 2012. I like it it\nmakes me feel better I have more energy\nI sleep better my digestion is certainly\nbetter and it supports the gut\nmicrobiome I do that for that reason but\nagain I want to emphasize that there are\nother great sources of all the relevant\nthings within those foundational\nformulas that athletic greens contains\nso it's certainly not the only route to\ncovering your foundational Health needs\nthere are other ways to do that now if\nsomebody has a budget lower than a\nhundred dollars per month to spend on\nfoundational supplementation well then\nthere are a couple of discussions to be\nhad now if the amount of money that they\nhave to devote to foundational\nsupplementation is zero of course\nrespect that and then it becomes a\ndiscussion about what sorts of foods and\npatterns of food intake are going to\nbest support their mental health\nphysical health performance now if\nsomebody has somewhere between zero\ndollars and fifty dollars to spend on\nsupplementation for sake of this thing\nwe're calling foundational Health per\nmonth well then a different category of\nsupplement discussion arises and we'll\nhave that in a moment but to sort of\nclose the conversation on foundational\nsupplementation\nagain that means many different things\nit's vitamins and minerals sometimes\nthat's one vitamin and mineral\nsupplement it means digestive enzymes\nthat could be its own supplement or in\ncombination with vitamins and minerals\nit means often not always adaptogens\nthings like ashwagandha different\nplant-based and mushroom-based\nformulations that can buffer stress and\nprovide other brain and body support\nand it often although not always but\nshould I believe include the probiotics\nand prebiotics or anything that supports\nhealthy gut microbiome\nonce again I think a broad spectrum\nsupplement that has many many\ningredients of high quality that covers\nall these bases is going to be the best\nroute to ensuring foundational\nsupplementation is covered and I do\nthink that should be the starting place\nfor any and all supplementation regimens\nI'll say that once again I think\ncovering your foundational needs in the\nrealm of vitamins minerals probiotics\ndigestive enzymes and\nadaptogens is going to give you the most\nbenefit\nby cost and the most benefit across the\nboard in terms of brain and body systems\nthat's going to allow you to feel better\noverall sleep better overall focus\nbetter overall and support all the\ndifferent systems in your brain and body\nthat are going to allow you to be at\nyour best while of course also paying\ncareful attention to your nutrition\nbecause you simply cannot abandon\nnutrition again Better Living Through\nChemistry still requires Better Living\nso now that we've had that discussion\nabout foundational supplementation\nand again highlighting the fact that\nthat's the one category of\nsupplementation where multi-ingredient\nformulations make the most sense I'd\nlike to now shift our attention to\nsingle ingredient formulation\nsupplements that are designed to achieve\nspecific endpoints and here again rather\nthan focus on specific ingredients and\nsupplements to achieve specific\nendpoints because we've done that\nalready in episodes related to sleep and\nfocus Etc\nI'd like to take a step back and focus\non the larger theme of today's episode\nwhich is how to think about\nsupplementation in a rational cost\neffective and biologically effective way\nfor each of these categories and the\nthree categories that I'm going to cover\nare sleep\nhormone support and cognitive\nenhancement and focus cognitive\nenhancement and focus being the final\nthird category\nlet's talk about sleep and the rational\napproach to thinking about\nsupplementation for sleep as I mentioned\nearlier in this episode and on many\nprevious episodes of this podcast sleep\nis the foundation of mental health\nphysical health and performance\nyou might be somebody who can do an\nall-nighter and feel okay the next day\nor maybe even great but most everybody\nonce they start to have minimal sleep\nfor one or two nights in the form of\nbroken sleep poor sleep not enough sleep\nor sleeping at the wrong time of night\nthere is such a thing or day\nthey start to suffer their mood starts\nto suffer their cognitive Clarity and\nperformance starts to suffer their\nmental health can suffer severely and\nphysical performance definitely suffers\nhormone suffer everything suffers\nconversely\nwhen people are sleeping well that is\ndeeply and enough eighty percent of the\nnights of their life\nmental health physical health and\nperformance all flourish and I think\nmost people start to be almost amazed at\nhow well they're doing in various\ndomains of life that previously they\nmight have struggled with so sleep is\nfundamental that's that's established\nwhen thinking about supplementation for\nsleep we need to ask ourselves a number\nof important questions first of all you\nshould ask yourself how well that is how\ndeeply and how much are you sleeping per\nnight assuming you're somebody who can\nfall asleep easily stay asleep through\nthe night wake up feeling relatively\nrested maybe a little groggy and then\ncan move about your day with plenty of\nenergy and focus you're not falling\nasleep in class or at work or behind the\nwheel whereas a passenger on public\ntransportation\nwell then you're probably getting enough\nsleep and by the way it's perfectly\nnormal to require anywhere from a 10\nminute to a 90 minute nap in the\nafternoon for some people if you're not\na napper no big deal it's known that\nnaps can disrupt nighttime sleep but\nprovided that they're early enough in\nthe day if you take a nap and you are\nstill able to fall asleep at night then\nnaps are fine for you if you're somebody\nwho doesn't like naps because you wake\nup groggy or grumpy which often happens\nto certain people then don't nap\nyou certainly do not need to nap but if\nyou're feeling energetic throughout the\nday chances are you're getting enough\nsleep at night but there are people of\ncourse who are struggling with sleep\neither falling asleep staying asleep or\nthey're not feeling alert enough during\nthe day or all of the above and then it\nmakes sense to step back and take a look\nat what supplementation can provide\nif you are one of those people who is\nnot sleeping enough or well enough at\nnight that you are suffering during the\nday in whatever way mild to severe there\nare two questions you should ask\nyourself first of all are you ingesting\ncaffeine after 2 pm if the answer is yes\nyou want to limit or eliminate caffeine\nafter 2 pm maybe even push it back to\nnoon or earlier I know that can be\nexcruciating for some folks but it can\nreally help with your ability to fall\nand stay asleep at night second thing is\nmost people would do well to avoid food\nwithin the two hours prior to bedtime\nbut of course you don't want to be so\nhungry that you can't fall asleep all\nright so those are the nutrition and\nbehavioral tools that everyone needs to\nconsider if you are not ingesting\ncaffeine\n2 p.m or onwards and you are not eating\nexcessively immediately prior to bedtime\nor within the two hours prior to bedtime\nand you're not hungry when you go to\nsleep well then there are certain\nsupplements that can support your sleep\nand we've talked about these in the\nperfect sleep episode and in the episode\nwith our guest expert Matt Walker from\nUniversity of California Berkeley and in\nthe master your sleep episode and we\nhave a tool kit for sleep that you can\naccess zero cost by going to\nhearinglab.com and going to the menu go\nto the newsletter and you can find that\ntoolkit you can sign up for other free\ntoolkits like it but\nthe point here is not to go\nsystematically through each of the\nsupplements that is beneficial or has\nbeen shown to be beneficial for sleep\nbut rather to address specific aspects\nof sleep that can suffer and why and how\ncertain patterns of supplementation can\nsupport or alleviate those pain points\nif for instance you're somebody who\nfalls asleep just fine but wakes up in\nthe middle of the night\naround 2 or 3 A.M or any time for that\nmatter and has trouble falling back\nasleep there are two categories of\nsupplements that you might want to\nconsider the first is myoinositol\ntypically taken as 900 milligrams of\nmyoinositol myoinositol can help shorten\nthe amount of time that it takes to fall\nback asleep if you wake up in the middle\nof the night myoinositol has other\nbeneficial uses as well for mood Etc if\nyou'd like to see many of the different\neffects that have been explored in the\nscientific literature from myoinositol\nyou can go to examine.com it's an\nexcellent site not just for inositol but\nfor all supplements for that matter\ntalks about the human effect Matrix that\nis the different effects of different\nsupplement compounds on different\naspects of hormone brain and body Health\nwhere the evidence is strong where the\nevidence is weak has links to studies\nand so on again it's examine.com amazing\nwebsite wonderful website it's provided\nsuch a rich resource for me and for you\nknow many many other people\nother people who wake up in the middle\nof the night will wake up because their\ndreams are very intense or they were\nhaving dreams that were so vivid that\nsuddenly they were jolted from their\ndreams those people would do well to\navoid certain supplements so in a moment\nI'll talk about the value of a\nsupplement called theanine for falling\nasleep but theanine which typically is\ntaken in dosages anywhere from 100\nmilligrams to 400 milligrams depending\non body weight and experience and what\nyou find to be most effective for you\nminimally effective for you well the\nIndian can be great for many people but\nfor people who have excessively vivid\ndreams\nthose excessively vivid dreams can lead\nto immediate waking and sometimes a\nlittle bit of anxiety upon waking in the\nmiddle of the night so some people who\nwake up in the middle of the night so\njolted\nmentally and physically out of sleep\nbecause of their intense dreams would do\nwell to avoid theanine supplementation\nI've talked about this a bit before but\nit's something that I think a lot of\nnighttime middle of the night wakers\nmight be familiar with and would want to\ntake into consideration now for those of\nyou that are not waking up in the middle\nof the night or not having excessively\nvivid dreams but are having trouble\nfalling asleep\ntwo supplements in particular have been\nshown to be effective for shortening the\ntransition time to sleep and allowing\npeople to ease into sleep more readily\nand those are magnesium 3 and 8 which is\ninterchangeable with magnesium bis\nglycinate\nmagnesium bisclycinate and magnesium\nthreonate both\nhave transporter systems that allow them\nto readily cross the blood-brain barrier\nand they lead to a mild form of\ndrowsiness mild in the sense that it's\nnot going to prevent you from operating\na motor vehicle or kind of any\nconditions under emergency that might\narise in the middle of the night or if\nthey did a rise during the middle of\nnight you'd still be able to function so\nit's not like a sleeping pill but people\nwho take those often find that their\ntransition time into sleep is much\nfaster and their sleep is also much\ndeeper incidentally those supplements\nare also thought to be useful for\ncognitive support and neuroprotection\nalthough there's less data on that\nokay so that's for falling asleep that's\none category either magnesium magnesium\nthree and eight or bis glycine would be\ninterchangeable for assisting the\ntransition time into sleep and then the\nother supplement is apogenin API\ng-e-n-i-n apogenin which is a derivative\nof chamomile I've talked about this in\nvarious podcasts before also acts as a\nbit of a anxiety lowering compound which\nis essential prior to sleep for people\nto essentially turn off their thinking\nor to be able to reduce the amount of\nruminating and problem solving and\nfuture anticipation that they're doing\nwhich is a requirement for falling\nasleep so what's the rational approach\nto supplementing in a way that allows\nyou to fall asleep more quickly and stay\nasleep well would you immediately take\nmagnesium three Nate and apogenin\ntogether well that depends if you have\nthe budget and you just simply want to\nfall asleep quicker and you don't care\nwhich of those two ingredients is going\nto be more effective for you well then\nyou could try one for instance magnesium\nthree and eight and try it for perhaps a\nweek and see how that affects your\nlatency to sleep time that is how\nquickly you fall asleep or you can try\napogenic in the first week or you could\ncombine them both or you could try\nmagnesium three night for a week then\nswitch to only apogenin for a week and\nevaluate which one works better for you\nif neither works for you I do recommend\ntrying the combination together again\nthis is just the way that any scientist\nwould design an experiment to try and\nunderstand which variables that is which\ningredients are most effective for the\nresult that you want as opposed to just\nlumping them together and taking them\nthat said a lot of people want excellent\nsleep so badly that they just say okay\nI'm just going to take magnesium 3 and 8\nI'm going to take apogen and I'm going\nto take theanine if my dreams are too\nVivid and I'm waking up in the middle of\nthe night from excessively vivid dreams\nI'll drop the theanine and many people\nactually derive great benefit from that\napproach but because today we're talking\nabout the most rational cost effective\nand biologically effective approach to\nsupplementation if you're not sleeping\nas well as you would like to\nor if you want to explore what sleeping\neven more deeply might do for your\nmental health physical health and\nperformance well then it makes sense to\nthink about the various supplements for\nfalling asleep versus remaining asleep\nwhat to include what not to include and\nto do that systematically and again I\nthink one week's time of taking\nsomething provided it doesn't\ninduce any negative effects right if\nsomething induces a negative effect I\nrecommend ceasing taking it immediately\nbut if something does not produce any\nnegative effects then I think you want\nto try a single ingredient formulation\nfor about a week while not varying\nanything else not changing anything else\nin your overall Protocols of nutrition\nor supplementation I mean it's\nimpossible to clamp everything perfectly\nfrom week to week but you know don't\nchange anything else dramatically and\njust add that supplement for a given\nweek see how it benefits your sleep\nmaybe add in a second second supplement\nif you like or rather Swap and try a\ndifferent supplement for a week and then\nsee what works best and see if the\ncombination works even better now I\nacknowledge that what I just described\nis exceedingly basic but it's something\nthat I don't think most people do most\npeople either decide they have the\nbudget and the interest in just\nimproving their sleep across the board\nand they don't care what ingredient is\nproviding the maximum benefit or they\nsimply try something and decide oh well\nit didn't work for me and so I'm not\ngoing to try anything else supplements\ndon't work for me or magnesium doesn't\nwork for me or\num you know I woke up in the middle of\nthe night from vivid dreams and that's\nbecause they're taking more of a shotgun\napproach without teasing out the\ndifferent variables in fact if there's\nan overriding theme of today's\nconversation it's really about learning\nhow to isolate variables in the realm of\nsupplementation because once you do that\nand once you start to develop that\nIntuition or sensitivity of sorts to how\ndifferent ingredients impact you\nit is an enormously powerful stance to\nhave because you're going to keep your\ncosts limited you're also going to find\nthe things that work particularly poorly\nfor you and more importantly the things\nthat work particularly well for you\ntoward your goals any discussion about\nsupplementation for sleep\nI feel has to include a discussion about\nmelatonin I've talked about melatonin\nbefore on numerous podcasts mine and\nothers and I will say once again I am\nnot a fan of melatonin for a couple of\nreasons melatonin is a hormone known to\ninduce sleepiness but not keep us asleep\nso oftentimes people will take melatonin\nfall deeply asleep and then wake up and\nhave trouble falling back asleep the\nother reason is that melatonin\nsupplements almost always include levels\nof melatonin or amounts of melatonin\nthat far far exceed the normal\nbiological levels or so-called\nendogenous levels of melatonin that we\nwould normally produce and yes it's true\nthat as we age we produce less melatonin\nbut melatonin as a hormone also impacts\nother hormone systems in particular the\nreproductive hormone access testosterone\nestrogen Etc which is not to say that if\nyou've been taking melatonin for some\nperiod of time that you've disrupted\nyour fertility or those hormone axes but\nit's possible that you've disrupted them\nsomewhat and it's very clear that\nmelatonin can impact not just sleep but\nother systems in the brain and body it\ncan be useful for jet lag and for\noccasional use but they're also I want\nto voice a message of caution\nthere have been studies exploring the\ndosages of melatonin contained in\nvarious supplements\nand whether or not what's listed on the\nbottle matches what's actually contained\nin those formulations and despite those\nformulations coming from quite reliable\nquote unquote or thought to be reliable\nsources it was found that these\nsupplements contain anywhere from 15\npercent\nof what's\nthought to be or is told to be in those\nsupplements or\nmany times more melatonin than is listed\non the bottle so the dosaging does not\nseem to be consistent with what's often\nlisted on the bottle and this is even\ntrue within some of the more reputable\nBrands so that's a real concern so we\nneed to highlight melatonin as perhaps\nsomething that's only used occasionally\nif you want to talk about dosages for\nmelatonin use for jet lag Etc go to\nexamine.com there's some excellent\nreferences to studies there just put\nmelatonin into the search function it'll\ntell you everything you need to know\nabout melatonin but now you know my\nstance on melatonin one question I often\nget about supplementation for sleep is\ndoes it create a dependency that's an\nexcellent question to ask\nI think most people\nworry about even fear relying on\nsomething so heavily that if they did\nnot have it for whatever reason that\nthey couldn't sleep\nin my experience there is no problem\nfalling and staying asleep in the\nabsence of a supplement for sleep even\nif you've been taking that supplement\nfor sleep\nconsistently seven days a week for\nmonths and months maybe even years on\nend I confess that I occasionally fall\nasleep having not taken my pre-sleep\nsupplements and I happen to take\nmagnesium three and eight theanine and\nepigenin I also take inositol it greatly\nenhances my sleep and there have been\nnights when I've fallen asleep not\nhaving taken any of those things and\nI've slept fine that said if I were to\nexplore multiple nights of trying to\nsleep without that supplementation I\nfind that my sleep is not as good I'm\nstill able to fall asleep but the depth\nof my sleep and the duration of my sleep\nis not as good as when I'm supplementing\nso I think that's\nrefreshing news at least to me that\nthere isn't a dependence on these\nsupplements in order to be able to fall\nasleep it's not the same sort of\ndependence that people experience from\nthings like sleeping pills that said\nany compound any compound can create a\nplacebo type effect where we think we\nneed something in order to achieve a\ncertain effect we had a guest on this\npodcast\nsome time ago Dr Ali Crum who's a\nprofessor at Stanford and works on these\nmindset effects belief effects and\nPlacebo effects and Placebo effects can\nbe very real and in some sense dovetail\nwith any conversation about dependency\nmeaning if you are somebody who loves\nyour sleep supplements and sleeps great\nwith them and one night you discover you\ndon't have them or you can't access them\nfor whatever reason that can create a\nlittle bit of an anxiety around the idea\nthat oh in the in their absence you're\nnot going to be able to sleep and that's\na sort of a placebo effect in Reverse if\nyou will because what it suggests is\nthat there's a emotional or a cognitive\nassociation with taking these things\nthat allows you to sleep well I would\nhighly recommend that people explore\nthis issue of dependency and Placebo\neffects for Sleep supplements on their\nown and under conditions in which\nthere's nothing pressing the next day\nthat is you don't have a big\npresentation\nEtc so what I recommend is that every\ntwo weeks or so maybe every month or so\ntake one night off completely from all\nyour sleep supplements or leave out one\nsleep supplement try to understand to\nwhat extent you might have established a\ndependency either real or Placebo based\non these sleep supplements and again I\nsuggest doing this on perhaps a Friday\nnight so that you know it's a weekend\nthe next day so you don't have to work\nif perhaps you don't sleep well I think\nwhat you'll find is what most people\nfind and that's\nin the absence of taking your supplement\nstack for Sleep one night you're still\ngonna sleep just fine now does that mean\nthat these supplements are not actually\nworking under normal conditions where\nyou're taking them each night no what\nthis means is that many of these things\nmagnesiums in particular can build up in\nthe body and brain in a way that can be\nbeneficial and what probably explains\nthe fact that you can still sleep if you\nmiss a night of taking them is that the\nneural circuits that are involved in\nturning off thinking or in not thinking\nand falling asleep those neural circuits\nundergo what's called plasticity in\nother words if you get better at falling\nand staying asleep over time even if you\ngot better at that through the\nAssistance or with the assistance of\nsome supplement or combination of\nsupplements well then those circuits are\nstill going to function just fine even\nin the absence of not taking those\nsupplements just once we'll get back\ninto this conversation a little bit\nlater when we talk about cognitive\nenhancement and focus\nit's the same story there where indeed\nthere are things that people can take in\nstimulant form and non-stimulant form\nthat can enhance cognitive ability and\nfocus but that does not mean that you\nbecome so dependent on those that you\ncan't focus unless you take them this\nhas been shown multiple times over so\nagain to answer the question is there a\ndependency established by taking\nsupplements for sleep\nthe short answer is no with the caveat\nthat Placebo effects and belief effects\nare always going to be at play whether\nor not you're talking about\nsupplementation prescription drugs or\neven behavioral protocols for that\nmatter I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor athletic\ngreens athletic greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink that\nalso contains digestive enzymes and\nadaptogens I started taking athletic\nGreens Way back in 2012 so that's 10\nyears now of taking athletic greens\nevery single day so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring this podcast the\nreason I started taking athletic greens\nand the reason I still take athletic\ngreens is that it covers all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs so\nwhether or not I'm eating well or enough\nor not I'm sure that I'm covering all of\nmy needs for vitamins minerals\nprobiotics adaptogens to combat stress\nand the digestive enzymes really help my\ndigestion I just feel much better when\nI'm drinking athletic greens if you'd\nlike to try athletic greens you can go\nto athleticgreens.com huberman

packs plus a\nyear supply of vitamin D3 K2 the next\ncategory of supplementation that I'd\nlike to talk about is hormone support\nimproving or so-called optimizing your\nhormones is a critical aspect of mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nwe've done multiple episodes about\nhormones including testosterone and\nestrogen\nfor both men and women and for people of\ndifferent ages we've also had episodes\non thyroid hormone growth hormone and so\non you can find all those at\nhubermanlab.com in fact you can go to\nthe hubermanlab.com website there's a\nsearch function where you can just put\nin a keyword and it will take you to all\nthe episodes and specific time points\nwhere that topic happens to be covered\nnow Hormone Health is such an important\ntopic to discuss in the context of\nsupplementation because\nindeed there are compounds that are\nnon-prescription based so-called\nsupplements that can improve hormone\nfunction again anytime we are discussing\na particular aspect of mental health\nphysical health or performance we need\nto start with a mention of the few\nbehavioral tools and nutrition-based\ntools or at least some top Contour\ncoverage of those in a way that frames\nup the discussion about supplementation\nappropriately\nso in the context of hormone support and\naugmentation and optimization\nif you are not getting adequate calories\nfrom high quality sources\nhormones like testosterone and estrogen\nwill suffer this is one of the reasons\nwhy women will stop having their periods\nif they're not ingesting enough calories\nthis is one of the reasons why\ntestosterone levels will drop if people\nare not ingesting enough calories in\nfact on the episode with expert guest\nand medical doctor Peter attia he\ndescribed how sex hormone binding\nglobulin this is a protein that's\npresent in males and females that binds\nto testosterone and other hormones and\nprevents it from being in its free form\nwhich is the more active form well\ninsulin which of course is going to\nincrease after the ingestion of\ncarbohydrates in particular insulin\nactually inhibits or reduces sex hormone\nbinding globulin what this means is that\nfor you intermittent fasters or people\nthat are ingesting very few\ncarbohydrates or have very low blood\nglucose or perhaps are taking things\nlike metformin or berberine which is a\nsupplement based approach to reducing\nblood glucose well your sex hormone\nbinding globulin is going to increase\ndramatically conversely if you are\neating enough calories in the form of\nfoods that allow your insulin to be a\nbit higher not excessively High we hope\nbut a bit higher well then sex hormone\nbonding globulin will go down and free\ntestosterone will go up so the\ndiscussion about hormone support and\naugmentation has to include some nod\ntoward or understanding of the fact that\nnutrition and the way that nutrition\nimpacts hormones and the way that\nhormones such as insulin impact other\nhormones such as free testosterone that\nall has to be acknowledged that is not\nthe topic of today's discussion but it's\nimportant that I remind everybody that\nnutrition matters for General hormone\nstatus\nit's also important to remember that\nbehaviors matter for hormone status\ngetting morning sunlight increases\ncortisol levels cortisol levels are very\nimportant to have elevated early in the\nday for focus and alertness and for\nimmune function and to make sure that\ncortisol levels are low at night and\nthereby levels of growth hormone and\ntestosterone which is secreted mainly in\nthe early morning can be elevated at\nnight and in the early morning so\ngetting morning sunlight getting\nstrenuous exercise in the form of both\ncardiovascular exercise but also\nrelatively short meaning an hour or less\nbouts\nof intense resistance training a few\ntimes per week can also dramatically\nalter hormone profiles in fact in the\nepisode that we did with Dr Duncan\nFrench again you find that episode at\nhubermanlab.com he described a very\nstrenuous but still brief two day a week\nprotocol of using resistance training\nspecifically to increase testosterone\nand free testosterone and growth hormone\nand so on\nso nutrition matters exercise matters\nwhen it comes to increasing supporting\nor augmenting different hormones and\nthat's just the discussion about\ntestosterone free testosterone and\nestrogen there's also the vast\ndiscussion about thyroid hormone Etc\nagain we've covered all those topics in\nprevious episodes but once those\nbehavioral\ntools are in place once you're doing the\nright things and you're avoiding the\nwrong things\ndoing the right things to support your\nhormones and avoiding the things that\ndiminish hormones in the ways that can\nbe detrimental\nonce your nutrition is in place to\nsupport your hormones then it makes\nsense to turn and consider what\nsupplements can support hormones but I\ndo believe that you want to get your\nbehaviors and your nutrition correct\nbefore you start thinking about\nsupplementation for hormones again I'll\nrepeat that get your nutrition and your\nbehaviors correct\nfor sake of hormones and for other\nhealth purposes before you start\nthinking about supplementation for\nhormones and certainly before you start\nthinking about prescription-based\napproaches to improving hormones\nonce all of those other elements are in\nplace\nthe supplements that make sense in terms\nof augmenting hormones come in two forms\none are broadband support for multiple\nhormones and then the others are\nsupplements that are designed to\nincrease or in some cases decrease\nspecific hormones or hormone Pathways so\nlet's consider each of those in tandem\nthere are certain supplements things\nlike Sheila G for instance something\nfrom ayurvedic medicine which may mainly\nuh has the active ingredient fulvic acid\nwhich is known to for instance increase\nthings like FSH follicle stimulating\nhormone which in women is going to\nincrease certain aspects of egg growth\nhence the name follicle stimulating\nhormone it's going to stimulate certain\naspects of fertility it's Pro fertile\nand in males can make for more sperm\nproduction or more motile sperm FSH is\nalso going to indirectly increase\ntestosterone in males it's known to\nincrease libido in both males and\nfemales so things like shilaji can\nindeed augment multiple hormones and\nsupport multiple hormone systems\ngenerally in the direction of\npro-fertility pro libido and increasing\nestrogen and testosterone\nnow there are other supplements such as\nashwagandha that also fall into this\ncategory of affecting multiple hormones\nashwagandha is a very potent\nsupplement in terms of reducing cortisol\nlevels it has also been shown to\nincrease testosterone levels but\nprobably indirectly and that's because\ncortisol and testosterone sort of exist\non a seesaw in terms of Pathways they're\non separate Pathways but those Pathways\ninteract enough that when cortisol is\nlowered in general testosterone tends to\nincrease now it is important that with\ncertain hormones like ashwagandha that\nyou don't take them for more than two\nweeks at a time at high dosages if you\nwant to know more of the specifics\naround ashwagandha and how long to take\nit how to cycle it Etc\nplease see our episode on Master stress\nplease also see the examine.com website\nand put in ashwagandha it will get into\nsome of that description\nbut\nSheila G ashwagandha and things for\ninstance like L-Carnitine a supplement\nthat we often discuss in terms of\nfertility because it can indeed improve\nsperm motility and quality and egg\nquality so it's a pro fertile compound\nbut it also impacts various\nmitochondrial Pathways so it's having a\nmore indirect effect on hormones there\nare many other\ncompounds present and available\nsupplements that are purported to be\npro-hormone support in particular for\ntestosterone or estrogen fertility and\nlibido there is a description for\ninstance of things like maca root maca\nroot can increase libido it's\nfound to be particularly effective in\nwomen but in men as well and in all\npeople who are suffering from lower\nlibido due to intake of ssris selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors for\nwhatever reason ssris are used to treat\nOCD they're used to treat depression any\nnumber of different things maca root can\nbe in many instances effective in\nincreasing libido it does that however\nthrough augmentation of dopamine related\nPathways and some of the hormone\nPathways Upstream of testosterone and\nestrogen the reports that Maca increases\ntestosterone\nare somewhat scant and a little bit weak\nto be honest so it's having these\nindirect effects that may impact\ntestosterone Downstream so again I'd put\nMaca alongside ashwagandha alongside\nshilaji as\nsupplements that are impacting multiple\nhormone Pathways toward increased libido\nincreased fertility increased\ntestosterone or estrogen likely through\nindirect pathways\nnow with all that said I'd like to\nprovide some examples of\nsupplements that work more directly on\nspecific hormone Pathways aimed at\nachieving more specific goals such as\nelevated testosterone or elevated free\ntestosterone or elevated growth hormone\nfor that matter and elevated thyroid\nhormone I'd like to talk about growth\nhormone first because it's actually a\npretty short discussion first of all the\nbest way to augment growth hormone is to\nget quality deep sleep especially the\nsleep that occurs in the first three or\nfour hours of the night is when growth\nhormone is released and it's going to be\nbeneficial to avoid caloric intake in\nthe two hours preceding sleep again\ndon't go to bed so hungry that you wake\nup an hour or an hour and a half later\nor you have trouble falling asleep but\navoiding food intake in the two hours\nprior to sleep and certainly avoiding\nalcohol and cannabis is going to\nfacilitate growth hormone release in the\nfirst hours of sleep many people use\nintermittent fasting or even longer\nperiods of fasting to increase growth\nhormone\none of the interesting things I learned\nfrom an expert guest Dr Kyle Gillette\nwho's a medical doctor\non this podcast is that indeed while\nlengthy or fast or intermittent fasting\ncan increase growth hormone levels very\nsubstantially it has indirect effects on\nthe genetic Pathways and The receptors\nfor growth hormone that actually are\ndetrimental for the function of growth\nhormone so avoiding food for the two\nhours prior to bedtime is a good idea if\nyou avoid food for longer that's just\ngoing to assist even more certainly\nisn't going to hurt in terms of growth\nhormone release but extended fast\nspecifically for the purpose of\nincreasing growth hormone\nare not really logical when you look at\nthe broader effects of extended fast\nthat is not to say that extended fasting\nis not appropriate for some people it\ncan be in certain instances or that\nintermittent fasted so-called time\nrestricted feeding is not beneficial for\nsome people it can be here I'm only\nreferring to the effects or in this case\nthe lack of effects of intermittent\nfasting time restricted feeding on\ngrowth hormones specifically now in\nterms of supplements to increase growth\nhormone there are very few supplements\nthat have been shown to augment this\npathway there is some idea that Arginine\nsupplementation prior to bedtime can\nfurther Elevate levels of growth hormone\nespecially when fasted that literature\nis rather weak to be honest I encourage\nyou to go to examine.com if you want to\nperuse those particular studies\nreally the things that increase growth\nhormone very potently fall outside the\nrealm of supplementation they include\nexercise again look at the Duncan French\nepisode or\nin the Kyle Gillette episode on\noptimizing hormones in males in\nparticular but this also pertains to\nfemales that avoiding food two hours\nprior to bedtime really can boost growth\nhormone significantly in sleep beyond\nwhat it would be otherwise but it's\nreally only once you get into the realm\nof prescription compounds things like\npeptides like sermorelin which increase\nigf-1 and growth hormone things like\ngrowth hormone Itself by prescription if\nand only if it's prescribed by a doctor\nof course and is safe for you that's\nwhen you start getting into really\nsignificant increases in growth hormone\nnot a lot of supplements out there to\nincrease growth hormone potently now\nit's a different story when you start\nthinking about and talking about\ntestosterone and free testosterone and\nluteinizing hormone luteinizing hormone\nis released from the pituitary which is\nthis gland\nnot far from the roof of your mouth and\nits nearby neighbor the hypothalamus is\na collection of neurons that sits above\nthe roof of your mouth and talks to the\npituitary talks to it through neural\nconnections and hormone-based\nconnections there is a hormone called\nGnRH gonadotropin releasing hormone that\nis released from the hypothalamus into\nthe pituitary it stimulates the release\nof luteinizing hormone or LH which then\ntravels in the bloodstream to impact\nmultiple tissues in the body but mainly\nthe ovary in females and the testes and\nmales to stimulate estrogen production\nand testosterone production there are\nsupplements that can potently increase\nGnRH\nand or luteinizing a hormone and then\nindirectly increase testosterone and\nestrogen and I always like to remind\npeople testosterone and estrogen are\npresent in both males and females okay\nand both are important for things like\nlibido muscle growth\nand so on a lot of people think that oh\nin males you know having very high\ntestosterone and low estrogen is\nactually ideal it's actually not ideal\nif you want to keep your libido anything\nthat lowers your estrogen too far is\ngoing to reduce your libido you don't\nwant estrogen too high but you also do\nnot want it too low so supplements that\ncan tickle this pathway or actually can\nact as a bit more of a directed hammer\non this luteinizing hormone pathway may\nalso impact GnRH are things like fedojia\nagrestis this is an herb\nthat I've talked about before on the\npodcast that when taken at dosages of\n600 milligrams per day many people not\nall report elevated levels of libido\nelevated sperm production elevated\ntestosterone in some cases elevated\nestrogen a bunch of hormones Downstream\nof luteinizing hormone now are you going\nto be a fedojia agrestis responder or a\nnon-responder there's simply no way to\nknow except by trying it if you are\ngoing to go down this route\nthere are two very important\nconsiderations first of all there's a\nfairly extensive literature on the fact\nthat fidoji agrestis can be toxic to\ntesticular cells and perhaps other cells\nwhen taken at very high dosages so\nobeying the particular dosages of\nfedogio aggressus that are recommended\non various product labels and cycling\nfor doji Augustus can be important some\npeople need to cycle it eight weeks on\ntwo weeks off other people opt for 12\nweeks on a month off I know a few people\nwho have taken it continuously with no\nissues but I do want to suggest caution\nwhen taking fidochio agrestis\nthe cautionary notes are stay within the\nrecommended dosage ranges you can go\nlower but certainly don't go higher and\nI think it is wise to cycle every eight\nweeks or so to come off it for two weeks\nand then going back on if that's your\nchoice if you feel it benefited you\nor taking it for 12 week periods of time\nand then cycling off for a full month\nbefore repeating again\nthe best way to know whether or not\nfedojia or any of these other\nsupplements is impacting your hormone\nlevels in the direction that you want\nand not impacting your hormone levels or\nother aspects of your biology in ways\nthat you don't want is from a blood test\nthere is simply no better tool to\nevaluate whether or not these\nsupplements are working to support your\nhormones in the ways that you want and\nnot causing issues\nexcept to take a blood test this podcast\nhas inside tracker as a sponsor that can\ndo in-home blood tests and give you\nblood panels there are other sources of\nblood tests that are quite good as well\nof course and in the first episode of\nThe huberman Lab podcast that I did with\nDr Kyle Gillette again a medical doctor\nexpert in hormones diabetes and various\nother aspects of medicine he described\nand it is time stamped how to stand the\nbest probability of getting your\ninsurance to cover a blood test how to\ntalk to your doctor about getting a\nhormone panel and so on so I'll refer\nyou to that episode for that but blood\ntests are going to be very important I\nrecommend taking them before adding in\nany supplement to increase\nhormones of any kind or decreased\nhormones of any kind for that matter and\nthen again after about four to eight\nweeks of taking that particular\nsupplement in order to evaluate whether\nor not it worked and whether or not it\nhad any negative effects that you would\nlike to avoid\nI also wanted to remind people of the\ndosage conversation that we had earlier\njust because there's a recommended\ndosage of fedogio agrestis of say 600\nmilligrams per day\nfirst of all that is not an invitation\nto take twice as much and expect twice\nthe positive effects that is not a good\napproach especially with something like\nfedogiograstis which can at high dosages\nbe toxic but it's also important to\nperhaps consider taking a lower dosage\nand seeing how that affects your\nhormones\nthat approach requires a bit more\npatience I know most people are thinking\nI want the effect and I want it now but\nI think it's very important when\nthinking about exercise your nutrition\nor supplementation to really play the\nlong game to think about what's going to\nwork for you in the immediate end in the\nlong term and to ease into any kind of\nsupplement regimen for instance by\ntaking one thing at a time varying One\nsupplement out and One supplement in\nstarting at minimal effective dose and\nbuild up your protocols over a year or\nseveral years it really can be\nbeneficial I can say for myself I\nstarted exploring the supplement space\nand taking different supplements in\ndifferent combination\nand alone evaluating which ones worked\nand did not work for me some were\nabsolutely dreadful for me I have tons\nof stories about supplement fail some of\nwhich were just kind of innocuous\nmeaning they were a waste of money which\nisn't innocuous but at least it wasn't\ndetrimental to my health other\nsupplements which fortunately don't\nexist on the market anymore\num I think actually uh were quite\ndangerous and I feel lucky that I did\nnot experience even greater negative\neffects from them other supplements have\nbeen tremendously useful for me and for\nother people for things like sleep and\nhormone support focus and so on so for\nDoja gracias is a good example of a\nsupplement that is known to have potent\neffects but you need to approach it with\nthe appropriate um I would say respect\nfor the fact that the dosage ranges in\nwhich it works\num have to be kept pretty narrow without\ncausing issues\nit does increase luteinizing hormone and\nthereby testosterone and estrogen so if\nyou're somebody who's already\nexcessively high in one or the other\nit's going to be very hard to just\ndirect it to only testosterone or only\nestrogen now the topic of today's\nepisode is not about fedoji Augustus per\nse I highlight it because it is one of\nthe more potent\nsupplements for sake of hormone\naugmentation but it's still fairly\nBroadband it's a little more specific\nthan something like shilaji but it's\nstill fairly Broadband in terms of\nhitting multiple endpoint hormones\ntestosterone and estrogen and maybe some\nother hormones as well\nthere are other supplements in\nparticular Tonga Ali which is known to\nfor instance increase libido whether or\nnot it does that by way of augmenting\ndopamine related Pathways or\ntestosterone Pathways still isn't clear\nit is known to increase free\ntestosterone by reducing sex hormone\nbinding globulin\nTonga Ali can be beneficial both for men\nand for women\nin dosages anywhere from 200 milligrams\nto 600 milligrams per day so there I\nwould say scale according to body size\nalthough start with the minimum amount\nand find the minimal effective dose for\nyou again blood work is going to be the\nmost effective way to determine what's\nworking or not working at the level of\nobjective numbers but subjective\nexperience matters too you know if you\ntake it at 400 milligrams for four weeks\nand you don't notice any effect you\nmight try it at 600 milligrams but not\nhigher and if you still don't see an\neffect well then it doesn't appear to\nhave worked for you other people\nexperience dramatic effects from things\nlike fedoja and Tonga Ali why would that\nbe the case well if you look to the\nscientific literature what you find is\nthat the studies that report the biggest\neffects of any supplement usually start\nwith a population that somehow\ndiminished or back on its heels in one\nparticular Dimension so for instance\npeople that are hypogonadal that are not\nmaking enough testosterone or free\ntestosterone in fact their levels are\nvery very low they're subclinical\noff range in terms of the charts\nbelow the normal\nwell those people when they take\nsupplements like Tonga Ali fedoja tend\nto experience greater effects because\nthey're starting from a lower level than\npeople who perhaps are close to the\noptimal levels achieved through either\nage genetics exercise nutrition or some\ncombination of those so that's an\nimportant thing to think about these are\ncalled floor effects and sealing effects\nceiling effects are for instance if an\nindividual already has very high\ntestosterone and free testosterone and\nthey take a supplement to increase it\nfurther they might not see any increase\nwhereas somebody who sits more in the\nmiddle to low range stands to experience\na much greater increase in fact one\nindividual I know who took Tonga Ali\nadmittedly on my recommendation his\ntestosterone was initially very low and\nhe was having a number of different\nsymptoms he did blood work he that's how\nhe knew it was low and he then took\nTonga Ali and fedoja in combination\nbecause he decided he just wanted\nresults he didn't care which What which\nthing was going to give him the results\nand he experienced big increases in\ntestosterone this would be not free but\ntotal testosterone of he experienced as\nmuch as 600 nanograms per deciliter\nincrease from where he was before which\nis very dramatic it was a near tripling\nof where his testosterone had started\noff to where he ended up I don't know if\nhe's ever done the experiment of\nremoving fidojia or Tonga to find out\nwhich one it was and this is why many\npeople just take them in combination and\nif you have the budget for it and you\nare interested in just finding what\nworks but not isolating what works at\nthe level of single ingredients that\nwould be the approach I recommend\nhowever again I think most people do\nwell to figure out which specific\ningredients are going to work best for\nthem by isolating the variables the way\nI've described repeatedly throughout\nthis episode to my knowledge Tonga Ali\ndoes not need to be cycled meaning you\ndon't have to take periods of time off\nfrom it I should note that the effects\nof Tonga Ali can take a little bit\nlonger to experience so perhaps blood\nwork should be done 8 to 12 weeks after\ninitiating the Tonga Ali protocol\nas opposed to earlier and it does seem\nto have sort of cumulative effects on\nlibido and that points to the likelihood\nthat it's having some impact on neural\nPathways as opposed to hormone Pathways\nhormone Pathways can be slow but in\ngeneral\nneural pathways are the ones that are\ngoing to explain slow Rising shifts in\nany kind of physical or mental aspect\nthat then remains stable over time so\nthe exact effects of Tonga Ali and where\nmeaning where they arise in the brain\nand body aren't known I will provide a\nlink to a really beautiful review\narticle that covers the literature on\ntonganali this came out fairly recently\nand that I've reviewed with a number of\nother\num MDS and medical or medicine related\npodcasters it's a really nice review\nI'll provide a link to that gives a\nsurvey of Tonga Ali what people are\ndiscovering what they're finding what\nthey're not finding and so forth as a\nfinal note on supplements for hormone\naugmentation and supplementation I want\nto make a brief mention of something\nspecifically related to female Health\nwhich is of course the menstrual cycle\nand across the menstrual cycle different\nhormones are present at different levels\nfollicle stimulating hormone is very\nhigh during the so-called follicular\nphase right and then you have your\nluteal phase we have an entire episode\ncoming up about female hormones and\nHormone Health that will cover this we\nalso covered a little bit of this in the\nother episodes on testosterone and\nestrogen but the point I'd like to make\nnow is that for women\nthey should fully expect that certain\nsupplements not all but certain\nsupplements because of the way they\nimpact different hormones would have\ndifferent effects maybe even opposite\neffects at different phases of the\nmenstrual cycle and for that reason I\nbelieve it is especially important\nto have tight control over dosage and\nindividual ingredients in your\nsupplement regimen so for instance if\nyou're somebody who takes Sheila Gene I\nknow many women who take Sheila G or\nTonga Ali\nfor instance or Maca and you find that\nit really serves you well that is it\nprovides the mental and physical\nbenefits that you want and enjoy\nat certain phases of your menstrual\ncycle but at other phases of your\nmenstrual cycle it feels like too much\nor it actually can start to give you\nnegative mental or physical effects well\nthen obviously having control over those\nspecific ingredients is going to be\nextremely important so that you can\ntitrate the dosage or increase the\ndosage as the case may be or cease\ntaking those things entirely at certain\nphases of your menstrual cycle\nthat's not to say that some women can't\njust continuously take these supplements\nthroughout their menstrual cycle some\ncan but some find that that makes them\nvery uncomfortable or that they would do\nwell to alter different ingredients at\ndifferent phases of their cycle so again\nthis speaks to the critical importance\nof single ingredient control dosage\ncontrol and the ability to cease taking\nindividual or multiple ingredients\naccording to the backdrop of your health\ngenerally and obviously the menstrual\ncycle is a profound shift in the\nhormones and thus the entire biological\nand psychological milieu that exists in\nthe body and of course there's the issue\nof birth control and whether or not\npeople are taking hormone-based birth\ncontrol certain forms of hormone-based\nbirth control and women involve\ntonically elevating that means\nconsistently elevating estrogen that's\ncertainly going to reduce the\nfluctuations and thus the probability\nthat certain hormones and hormone\nPathways will change across the\nmenstrual cycle but not eliminate it\naltogether also there's the key issue of\nfertility in both males and females one\nimportant note even though this is not\nan episode about fertility we're going\nto have one soon but the important point\nabout fertility is that there are\nsupplements not just Sheila G but there\nare supplements and supplement protocols\nsuch as\nL-Carnitine in particular injectable\nL-Carnitine which does require a\nprescription at least in the US but also\norally ingested L-Carnitine that can\nimprove sperm health and motility and\negg health and motility I mentioned that\nearlier\nbut if couples are trying to conceive\nit is important that if you're going to\ntake something that is a supplement\ndirected towards sperm and or egg Health\nthat you also consider how that\ninterfaces with some of the other\nhormone-based\ncompounds that is prescription drugs\nthat you may be taking this is true for\npeople who are doing IVF in vitro\nfertilization or not\nagain that entire discussion will be\nhandled in our episode on fertility and\non female hormone health and we already\ndid the episode with Dr Kyle Gillette on\nmale hormone Health optimization the\nnext category of supplementation that\nI'd like to address is supplements\nrelated to cognitive enhancement and\nfocus and here there are a number of\nvery useful strategies that one could\ntake I'd like to divide this\nconversation into two general categories\nof supplements to address cognitive\nenhancement and focus the first category\nare supplements that increase energy by\nway of stimulant properties so the most\nobvious of these is caffeine caffeine is\nof course a molecule that can increase\nlevels of alertness it also can increase\nlevels of focus provided that dosages\nare in the appropriate range the\nappropriate range in most cases is going\nto be one to three milligrams per\nkilogram of body weight taken\n30 minutes or so before any kind of\nmental or physical Endeavor we did an\nentire episode about caffeine where you\ncan learn lots of facts about caffeine\nhow best to utilize caffeine and indeed\nI'll just give you a few of those now\nturns out that if your regular caffeine\nuser you can still derive the cognitive\nenhancing and focus enhancing effects of\ncaffeine if you ingest caffeine every\nday but if you were to take two days off\nfrom caffeine completely and right now I\nhear all the caffeine addicts out there\njust kind of cringing at the idea and\nthen take caffeine in the 30 minutes\nprior to some especially important event\nphysical or mental event where you\nreally need to focus and be able to\nsustain that Focus for long periods of\ntime it would have an even greater\neffect than it normally would but since\nmost people are taking caffeine in a\nkind of ongoing regular way I just want\nto emphasize that it still has Pro\ncognitive and pro-focus effects even if\nit's taken every day or even multiple\ntimes per day again a cautionary note\ndon't drink caffeine too late in the day\npast 2 p.m it can really start to impede\nuh your sleep at night even if you can\nfall asleep at night the architecture of\nthat sleep is not going to be great if\nyou're ingesting caffeine in the\npreceding eight to ten and even 12 hours\nand that actually raises another\ntangential but still important point so\nI'm going to make it and then get back\nto supplements which is the best\ncognitive enhancer that you will ever\ntake is a really good night's sleep of\nsufficient duration okay so sleep is\ngoing to be the Bedrock of your ability\nto focus and remember things in fact\nit's during sleep that neural\nconnections remodel so-called\nneuroplasticity it's actually not when\nyou trigger learning but it's when you\nconsolidate and reinforce learning and a\nnumber of other things that relate to\ncognitive enhancement and focus the\nother thing of course is that you're\ngoing to need to have sufficient levels\nof nutrition so you don't want to be\noverly hungry or it's going to be hard\nto focus nor do you want to be\noverloaded with calories or a volume of\nfood or have your blood glucose to be so\nhigh that it's going to make you sleepy\nthere's a reason why when discussing\nstress and the so-called autonomic\nnervous system that the phrase rest and\ndigest comes into play rest and digest\nas the name implies relates to the fact\nthat when we have\na lot of food in our gut it tends to\nmake us sleepy in other words it's hard\nfor us to focus and it's hard for us to\nmaintain cognitive attention and\nremember things Etc so there are a bunch\nof Behavioral tools for enhancing Focus\nwe did an entire episode on enhancing\nfocus it does touch on supplementation\nagain you can find links to that in all\nformats at hubermanlab.com we also have\na newsletter related to this topic also\nat hubermanlab.com at zero cost\nwith all of that said and in particular\nthe Highlight about sleep being the best\nway to enhance your cognitive abilities\nand focus anytime we're having a\ndiscussion about supplements for\nenhancing cognitive ability and focus a\nmajor category of those supplements is\ngoing to fall into the stimulant\ncategory and that's going to include\nmost often caffeine although there are\nother sources of stimulants I'm not\ngoing to touch on those for the moment\njust talk about caffeine when people\nhear caffeine they think well I can just\ndrink coffee and indeed that's a great\nsource of caffeine so is yerba mate I\nwould caution people to\num if you're going to use yerba mate for\nwhatever purpose caffeine or otherwise\nthat you avoid the smoked versions of\nyerba mate they are carcinogenic that is\nthe smoked versions or carcinogenic I\nknow and to consume the non-smoked uh\nvarieties\num instead the important thing to\nunderstand about caffeine is that while\nit can be ingested in the form of a\ndrink or an energy drink to your coffee\nit can also be ingested as a pure\nsupplement that is there are caffeine\nsupplements and I know a number of\npeople including a very very prominent\npodcaster whose name I won't mention who\ndrinks herbal tea but takes a 100 to 300\nmilligram tablet of caffeine with the\nherbal tea so in that case it is no\nlonger herbal tea it is caffeinated\nherbal tea\nwhen you take caffeine in pill form it\ntends to have a much more potent and\nlong lasting effect than when you take\ncaffeine in\nthe form of coffee or tea it's actually\na world apart in terms of its effects\nand if you haven't experienced this\nbefore it might be something that you\nwant to explore it might not be\nsomething you want to explore in\nparticular if you're somebody who\nexperiences anxiety or panic attacks be\nvery careful with your intake of\ncaffeine again see the episode of the\nhuberman law podcast all about caffeine\nfor more on that but\nit is the case that even 100 milligrams\nof caffeine in tablet form I suppose it\ncould be in capsule form as well but in\nits pure form leads to much greater\nenhancement of alertness and focus then\ndoes often the comparable amount or even\ntwice the amount of caffeine contained\nin coffee or tea now why would that be\nhas a lot to do with the other things\nthat are in coffee and tea so here I'm\nnot encouraging people to become reliant\non caffeine capsules or on caffeine\ntablets but if you want to increase\nalertness and focus caffeine is a potent\nway to do that it works the other\ncategory of stimulant that can work in\nterms of enhancing alertness and focus\nare going to be things that increase\nadrenaline in some other way or\nepinephrine as it's also called\nadrenaline epinephrine same thing in\nsome other way that are going to\ntouch into or augment the so-called\nadrenergic and adrenaline systems and\nthere are things like yohimbine and\ndifferent forms of yohimbine like Alpha\nyohimbine\num there are multiple forms of these\nthings now I would go to examine.com to\nexplore the different forms of your\nhimbine about 10 20 years ago yohimbine\nwas marketed primarily as a pro libido\nand pro-erectile agent turns out it has\nvery low efficacy for both of those\nthings but there are certain forms of\nyohimbine that act as stimulants\nthat are effective and are separate from\nthose claims and Pathways one particular\nform is called Alpha yohimbine it\nsometimes goes by the name raulstein and\nthat's spelled\nr-a-u-w-o-l-s-c-i-n-e again that's Alpha\nyohimbine and it's used as a stimulant\noften to also promote fat loss and\nalertness I have to say that it's a very\npotent and somewhat\num precarious supplement some people\nexperience a lot of anxiety on it that\ncould also be because they tend to take\nit on either an empty stomach or in\ncombination with sub caloric diets it's\na it's sort of getting out on the edge\nof things that for some people can work\nnot so well for other people they might\nactually find it to be a very effective\nstimulant in general in terms of\nsupplement based approaches to increase\ncognitive\nfunction and focus caffeine either in\ncoffee or tea form or in tablet or\ncapsule form but at lower dosages than\nyou would find in coffee and tea I think\nis actually a reasonable way to explore\nstimulant-based approaches\nfor enhancing cognitive function and\nfocus I mentioned all that not because I\nthink that you probably already didn't\nknow that caffeine can enhance alertness\nand focus most people already know that\nand I acknowledge that but rather as a\ncontrast point for the other supplement\nbased approach for increasing cognitive\nfunction and focus which is\nto increase certain neurotransmitter\nPathways that are not stimulant based so\nfor instance\nAlpha GPC which is essentially a choline\ndonor acts in the pathways related to\nthe neuromodulator acetylcholine and can\nenhance Focus so at dosages of anywhere\nfrom 300 to 600 milligrams people\nexperience heightened levels of focus\nfor sake of mental work or physical work\nthe half-life of alpha GPC is about four\nto six hours so it's relatively short\nlasting although you wouldn't\nnecessarily want to take it right before\nbed I don't recommend that it is not a\nstimulant it tends to enhance focus by\naugmenting acetylcholine and\nacetylcholine Pathways specifically now\nit does create a little bit of an\nincrease in alertness\nso some people actually perceive it\nsubjectively as an increase in\noverall stimulation but it's different\nthan a caffeine type stimulant so for\ninstance 300 milligrams to 600\nmilligrams of alpha GPC taken alone will\nallow people to be more focused but\ndoesn't tend to make people feel jittery\nor over stimulated\nsimilarly\n500 milligrams to a thousand milligrams\nor somewhere in between of something\nlike l-tyrosine which is amino acid\nprecursor to dopamine a different\nneuromodulator taken a loan or in\nconjunction with again I believe in\nseparating these things out by product\nbut I suppose you could take Alpha GPC\nNL tyrosine together if you had already\ntried them separately and decide they\nworked well for you then you decide to\ncombine them what people tend to\nexperience is that the cholinergic\nstimulation from alpha GPC and the\ndopaminergic stimulation from l-tyrosine\nor simply l-tyrosine alone or Alpha GPC\nalone leads to increased levels of focus\nwithout the kind of overall feelings of\nstimulant-based alertness that one would\nexperience with caffeine and indeed or I\nshould say of course there are products\nout there and there are people out there\nthat combine all three of these things\ntogether caffeine Alpha GPC and\nl-tyrosine and while I'm not suggesting\nthat's a good or a bad thing I would\nsuggest that anytime you start to\nexplore the cognitive enhancing effects\nand the focus enhancing effects of any\nsupplement that you ask which ones are\nstimulants so for instance caffeine and\nAlpha human being\nwhich ones tend to tap more into\nneuromodulator systems like Alpha GPC\nand l-tyrosine and to separate those out\nconceptually because whereas things like\nAlpha yohim binding caffeine will mostly\nserve the role of increasing levels of\nalertness but not tightening your focus\nthings like Alpha GPC and l-tyrosine\ntend to serve the role of less elevation\nand alertness but more tightening of\nfocus and this of course is why people\noften stack these and take them in\ncombination so I think it's a very\nimportant distinction that most people\naren't aware of and I'm not here to tell\nyou that the stimulant-based approach or\nthe neuromodulator based approach is\nbetter or worse they are simply\ndifferent from one another although I\nwill say that I think it is important to\nexplore them separately if indeed you're\ngoing to explore any of them before you\nwould start to combine them in a single\nformula again individual ingredients are\ngoing to be the way to go in terms of\nfiguring out what's best for you if\nanything some people may find that even\nthe slightest bit of caffeine or even\nthe slightest spit of alpha GPC or\nl-tyrosine just places them into a state\nof mind and or body that's just\nuncomfortable and not\ncompatible with the kind of work that\nthey want to do whereas other people\nsearching myself\nregularly rely on taking 300 milligrams\nof alpha GPC it turns out more than that\nkind of doesn't work for me or it tends\nto send my mind down a pathway that I\ndon't like to be in for sake of\ncognitive work but I will routinely take\n300 milligrams of alpha GPC prior to\nsome cognitive work or prior to a\nworkout I do often combine that with\nsome caffeine not in capsule or pill\nform but rather in the form of cup of\ncoffee or yerba mate and it turns out\nthat for me just by way of example\nl-tyrosine is something that works very\npowerfully to elevate my level of focus\nbut that I tend to crash pretty hard\nafterward and so I tend to error away\nfrom l-tyrosine but some people tolerate\nit really well and actually really like\nit I rely on something else for dopamine\naugmentation which is\nphenylethylamine which is a little bit\nmore short lasting again I arrived at\nthese protocols for myself by mixing and\nmatching but mostly by trying individual\ningredients alone before combining them\ninto any sort of cocktail before taking\nthem you for a workout or before a\ncognitive work bout and I suggest that\nyou explore them in the same way because\nthat's going to deliver you to the best\npossible protocols for you which only\nyou can determine and then of course\nthere's the category of supplements that\ncan support cognitive function and focus\nbut that also touch on other General\nfunctions related to brain and body\nHealth such as metabolic Health mood Etc\nand the one that comes to mind here are\nthe omega-3 fatty acids I've talked a\nlot about omega-3 fatty acids that are\navailable in the form of foods so for\ninstance fatty ocean fish there's\ncertain plant-based sources for these as\nwell certain algaes and things of that\nsort touched on this in the episodes on\ndepression that I've done\nbut\nthis topic mainly comes up around the\nissue of fish oil fish oil capsules and\nliquid and this is a discussion I think\nis worth having\nearly on in the episode we talked about\nfoundational nutrition and supplements\nthat include a bunch of different\ningredients we touched on the idea that\nsome people might have the budget to\ntake one such product or any number of\ndifferent products that combine all\nthose ingredients\nI should say that for those that are\ninterested in taking a supplement\nbut have a lower budget than would allow\nfor taking one of those General\ncategories of supplements we talked\nabout earlier for foundational nutrition\nthat combines everything vitamins\nminerals probiotics prebiotics\nadaptogens digestive enzymes\nI do think that there's a category of\nsupplements that can greatly enhance the\nprobability of offsetting depression and\nmaybe even improve mood directly or\nindirectly there's evidence for what I'm\nabout to tell you within the scientific\nliterature and or offset the amount of\nantidepressant medication that people\nneed to take that's also been\ndemonstrated and improve metabolic\nfunction cardiovascular function\nand also\nenhance our ability to do focused work\nand here I'm referring to the so-called\nomega-3 essential fatty acids in\nparticular the omega-3 form of the\nessential fatty acids there's now a lot\nof data showing that ingesting one to\nthree grams of EPA in particular\nin the form of either fish oil capsules\nor liquid can be beneficial for a number\nof different aspects of brain and body\nhealth and can enhance\nfocus and cognitive ability\nthis is especially true in developing\nbrains and there's actually an extensive\ndata out of a laboratory at University\nof California Santa Barbara talking\nabout how mothers who supplement\nOmega-3s in particular the epas although\nthey also need to get the dhas\nthat leads to Greater brain weights and\nhealth of Offspring this is something we\nwill definitely explore in a future\nepisode likely with an expert guest\nwho's doing that work in that laboratory\nat UC Santa Barbara\nthe point here is that if somebody has a\nlimited budget to purchase supplements\nand cannot afford a foundational\nsupplement in the sort that we talked\nabout earlier athletic greens are\nsimilar but they do have a budget that\nwould allow them to purchase a high\nquality Omega-3\nfatty acid fish oil that would and to\ningest it in quantity sufficient enough\nto get above that one gram of EPA per\nday again this is really important if\nyou look at the product labels you'll\noften see you know 1500 or 1600\nmilligrams\nof essential fatty acids but the key is\nyou get above that one gram of EPA per\nday threshold and as high as three grams\nper day we had a guest on this podcast\nDr Rhonda Patrick who takes anywhere\nfrom I believe three to four maybe even\nmore grams of EPA per day for a variety\nof reasons including some of the reasons\nwe're discussing now before we move on\nto discussing some of the more Global\nthemes related to developing a rational\nsupplementation protocol\nI do want to touch on this vast category\nof supplementation that includes\nfood-based or food mimic type\nsupplements so this would be for\ninstance whey proteins or milk proteins\nor egg proteins or plant proteins that's\na discussion that in and of itself\ndeserves an entire episode if you want\nto understand which types of protein and\nsource of proteins are going to be the\nmost bioavailable the best for protein\nsynthesis for recovery from exercise\nbuilding muscle Etc I'd like to refer\nyou to a segment within the episode that\nI did with Dr Lane Norton where he talks\nabout total protein needs per day it's\nabout one gram per pound of body weight\nper day for most people although there's\nsome variation depending on activity Etc\nand the quality of sourcing of those\nvarious proteins is extremely important\nand that of course leads to a discussion\nabout the quality and type of protein\nthat would be present in a supplement\nlike a whey protein supplement or casein\nwhich is a milk protein based supplement\nthat discussion is segmented and time\nstamped in the episode that I did with\nthem you can find at hubermanlab.com he\nactually pointed to some interesting\ndata on potato protein as perhaps being\na great plant-based substitute for those\nthat don't want to take whey-based\nprotein but the fact that whey-based\nproteins can be very useful for getting\nto and above a protein threshold for all\nsorts of reasons not just for muscle\nbuilding although it's great for that\nbut for other purposes as well\nand that's about one category of\nfood-based or food mimic type\nsupplements there are for instance\nbranched chain amino acids there are for\ninstance green tea supplements there's a\nhuge landscape of this far too much for\nus to get into in any kind of\num reasonable detail but I do want to\nacknowledge that those all exist the key\nthing to understand is that while they\ncan serve a great role in providing\nreplacement for meals that you perhaps\ncouldn't have consumed otherwise and\nwhile they often are very convenient\nbecause you can drink as opposed to eat\nyour calories I think that most people\nwould agree that\ngetting some significant fraction of\nyour nutrition from Whole Foods is going\nto be useful for a variety of reasons in\nparticular the fiber that comes along\nwith it the bulk of the food that tends\nto make us feel sated\nand of course the fact that a lot of\nvitamins and minerals and other things\nthat are contained within Foods as well\nas essential fatty acids in foods like\nanimal-based proteins are not going to\nbe present in most if not all of those\nkind of food mimic type powders and\nreplacements for food another point is\nthis question about\nage-related effects so for instance\nshould kids be taking supplements well I\nmentioned earlier that there's some\nevidence that making sure that kids are\ngetting enough omega-3 fatty acids can\nbe beneficial they certainly could get\nthose from food-based sources just look\nup online food-based sources of omega-3\nfatty acids and epas and you'll see\nlists there\nsome people choose to supplement on top\nof that in particular in kids that are\ndeveloping very quickly\nI regardless of whether or not they're\nconsuming enough epa's from food some\nparents choose to supplement on top of\nthat I am personally not a fan of\nchildren taking melatonin for the reason\nthat melatonin is already chronically\nelevated in kids and there's a growing\nbody of literature that melatonin\nsupplementation in kids can be\npotentially harmful I don't want to\ncreate alarm among those who've already\nbeen taking it or giving it to their\nkids or that gave it to their kids in\nthe past but I do think that melatonin\nin particular should be approached with\na lot of caution especially for kids and\nthen of course there's the issue of\nwhether or not all these other\nsupplements that we've discussed whether\nor not kids can take them safely and\nagain it's highly individual I would say\nthat for the supplements that relate to\nhormone augmentation and support\nunless your physician a board-certified\nMD specifically recommends them I would\nstrongly suggest avoiding intake of\nthose things until at least after\npuberty and probably in to the late\nteens and early 20s because the body and\nbrain are still developing and hormone\nsystems are still active even though\npuberty may happen between ages you know\n11 and 14 or even 15. puberty can be a\nlong lasting event with a long taper and\ntail\non it so you want to be cautious about\naugmenting hormones in young people\nthrough the use of supplementation\nunless a physician is working very\nclosely with you or rather you with them\nand then in ages of say 22 years old 24\nand older I don't see any reason why\npeople who are in their 50s or 60s would\nhave any different protocols than people\nin their 30s and 40s except perhaps in\nthe domain of cognitive enhancement\nwhere it might make sense again might\nprovide it it can be done safely and\nwith the consult of a physician\nit might be beneficial for people who\nare approaching their later years to\nconsider increasing dosages or the\nvariety of things and approaches that\nthey take for cognitive enhancement\nbecause age-related cognitive decline is\na reality there is no person that\nescapes that the question is whether or\nnot the slope of that decline is very\nsteep or very shallow and of course this\nis an opportunity for me to raise the\npoint that I made much earlier and that\nI'll make over and over again because it\nreally is the most important point to\ntoday's discussion which is that\nbehaviors both exercise sleep making\nsure that your relationship to light\ngetting sufficient sunlight early in the\nday and throughout the day if you can\nand limiting your viewing of bright\nartificial light in the late evening and\nespecially between the hours of 10 pm\nand 4 a.m things of that sort all the\ndo's and don'ts\nand of course cardiovascular exercise\nand resistance training exercise and\nmaybe even flexibility training exercise\ntopics we've covered extensively on this\npodcast and for which we'll soon have a\nspecial series airing with Dr Andy\nGalpin that gets into a lot of detail\nand protocol development that you can\nall employ\nall of that needs to be done at every\nage certainly past puberty in order to\nmaximize cognitive function in order to\nmaximize cardiovascular function in\norder to maximize focus and every aspect\nthat we really all stand to and want to\nenhance when we think about\nsupplementation so again get your sleep\nright do that by getting your\nrelationship to light right get your\nexercise right Quality Social connection\nright and then of course there's that\nlandscape of nutrition that we talked\nabout extensively earlier and for which\nwe have other episodes that really dive\ndeep including that episode or I should\nsay in particular that episode with Dr\nLane Norton where we really took a full\nsurvey of the landscape of nutrition\neverything from protein needs vitamins\nminerals fiber microbiome it's a\ndeep deep discussion with a lot of\nactionable takeaways if you're curious\nabout nutrition and in particular if\nyou're a vegan or vegetarian or\ncarnivore based but even for the more\ncommon omnivores such as myself I found\nthat to be an incredible Learning\nJourney thanks to Dr Lane Norton just so\nmuch useful knowledge in that episode if\nyou want to learn more about nutrition\nthe behavioral tools the nutritional\ntools are really going to serve as the\nprimary two layers upon which your\nsupplementation Protocols are going to\nrest and again I want to emphasize that\nyour supplementation protocol may be\nzero supplements it could include no\nsupplements whatsoever and that would be\nperfectly fine provided that you're\nsleeping as well as you want to and need\nto you're able to focus and work as well\nas you want to and need to you're able\nto perform physically as well as you\nwant to and need to and you feel that\nyour hormones and related functions are\nwhere you want them\nhowever for most people\nwho are doing most everything right\nthey want to explore how they can make\nthings like their sleep their focus\ntheir hormone function even better and\nthat's where supplementation makes a lot\nof sense and when I say it makes a lot\nof sense I mean it makes a lot of sense\nto explore in a rational and regimented\nway there are a couple of big themes\nthat we've talked about a few times\nduring today's podcast that I'd like to\nreiterate now because they are so\ncrucial to developing a rational\nsupplementation protocol the most\nimportant of which is unless we're\ntalking about foundational nutritional\nsupport that is coverage of vitamins\nminerals digestive enzymes probiotics\nprebiotics and adaptogens\nwe should really be focusing on single\ningredient formulations foundational\nsupplements that include all those\nthings I just listed off all combined in\nOne supplement are fine I simply don't\nsee any other practical or reasonable\nway to get each and every one of those\nthings through single ingredient\nformulations however when you want to\nstart thinking about and actually\npractically exploring things like\nsupplementation for sleep or Hormone\nHealth or cognitive function the single\ningredient formulations are going to\ngive you the most power and control\nthey're going to make sure that you can\nfind the minimal effective doses that\nyou can rule out things that are not\neffective for you or that may be\ndetrimental for you in whatever fashion\nand it's not just about cost\nEffectiveness it's also about arriving\nat small kits or cocktails of\nsupplements that you can really manage\nand work with that you're not dependent\non but that you really feel can augment\nthe various aspects of your health that\nare important to you so that's really\nwhat today's episode is about even\nthough we had coverage of specific\nsupplements and their functions in these\ndifferent domains of mental and physical\nhealth and performance today's episode\nwas really geared toward giving you\nresources and a framework to think about\nhow to approach supplementation how to\nnavigate sticking points and pain points\nin supplementation how to get the most\nout of your supplementation regimen\nwithout spending an excessive amount of\nmoney and if you don't have finances to\nallow for a lot of exploration of\nsupplements how to narrow in on the most\neffective supplements the most quickly\nand derive all the benefits that you can\nfrom them and as a final point the that\nis redundant with a few of the themes we\ntalked about today but that I don't\nthink I ever really explicitly stated is\nthat\nwhile the word supplement makes it sound\nlike these compounds are something just\nto add on top of or compensate for\ndeficiencies in nutrition or other areas\nof your life many of them are actually\nquite potent compounds these are potent\nnon-prescription\nmolecules that really can move the\nneedle in terms of your ability to think\nmore clearly sleep better support your\nhormone function but as always they are\njust one element within an ecosystem of\nother factors such as your behaviors\nwhich includes do's and don'ts such as\nyour nutrition maybe even such as\nprescription drugs that you also might\nhappen to be taking or hoping to be\ntaking less of or removing completely\nagain that has to be done in discussion\nwith Physicians if you're going to do it\nat all but\nthe real Point here is that what we call\nsupplements are actually a powerful gear\nwithin a larger system aimed at each and\nevery one of us
