    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nRecently, the Huberman\nLab hosted a live event\nat the Beacon Theater\nin New York City.\nThe event was entitled,\n\"The Brain-Body Contract,\"\nand it consisted of\na lecture followed\nby a question and answer\nsession with the audience.\nWe wanted to make the recorded\nversion of that question\nand answer session\navailable to everybody,\nregardless of who could attend.\nSo what follows is the\nquestion and answer\nperiod from the Brain-Body\nContract live Huberman Lab\nevent.\nWant to be sure to thank the\nsponsors from that event.\nThey were Eight\nSleep, which makes\nsmart mattress covers with\nheating and cooling capacity.\nI started sleeping on\nan Eight Sleep mattress\ncover about eight months\nago, and it has completely\ntransformed my sleep.\nI sleep so much deeper.\nI wake up far less during the\nmiddle of the night, if at all,\nand I wake up feeling far\nbetter than I ever have,\neven after the same\namount of sleep.\nIn fact, I love my Eight Sleep\nso much that when I travel--\nnow, I'm quite bothered that\nAirbnbs and hotels don't\nhave Eight Sleep\nmattress covers on them,\nand I've even shipped my\nEight Sleep mattress cover out\nto meet me in the location\nthat I arrived to so that I\nget the best possible sleep.\nIf you want to try\nEight Sleep, you can go\nto eightsleep.com/huberman to\nsave up to $400 off their Sleep\nFit Holiday Bundle, which\nincludes their new Pod 3 Cover.\nEight Sleep currently\nships in the USA,\nCanada, United Kingdom,\nselect countries in the EU,\nand Australia.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman.\nI'd like to also thank our\nsupplement partner, Momentous.\nThey make the very highest\nquality supplements.\nThey ship internationally, and\nthey formulated supplements\nas single-ingredient\nformulations\nthat match what is discussed\non the Huberman Lab podcast.\nIf you're interested in\nany of those supplements,\nplease go to\nlivemomentous.com/Huberman.\nAnd now, without further ado,\nthe question and answer session\nfrom the live event held\nat the Beacon Theater\nin New York City.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nYou've said before that\nstress can be good for us,\nbut how do we know\nwhen it's too much?\nThat's a good question,\nand I should preface that\nby saying that there's\nsome incredible work that\nwas done by a colleague\nof mine, Dr. Alia Crum.\nAli is how she goes\nby, Dr. Allie Crum.\nWho is a-- she was a\nDivision I athlete.\nShe's a tenured professor\nof psychology at Stanford.\nShe's a licensed clinical\npsychologist, like everyone.\nSo when I look\naround my colleague,\nI'm like, oh, my goodness.\nWho are these people?\nVery humbling place to be.\nBut she's made some\nimportant discoveries,\nand I want to just\nhighlight one, which\nis this notion of mindset.\nAnd no, these are\nnot placebo effects,\nbut let me just tell you.\nWhen you think about stress,\nhow you think about stress\nis really important.\nFirst of all, you\ncan't lie to yourself.\nBut if for instance you watch\na one or three-minute video,\nas she's given subjects\nin her lab about stress,\nand it tells you all\nthe terrible things\nthat stress does to your\nimmune system and sleep,\nthen you experience\nthose things-- increases\nin blood pressure, et cetera.\nHowever, if you watch a one\nto three-minute video that's\nalso true about the fact\nthat stress can sharpen\nyour decision making for\ncertain kinds of things,\nactually, can accentuate\nyour immune system.\nI wish someone had helped me get\nthis narrative right out there.\nStress does not deplete\nyour immune system,\nunless it goes on\na long, long time.\nWe'll talk about what\nlong means in a moment.\nWhy would it?\nThink about it.\nIf you had to fast\nand move with family\nor weather a storm of any\nkind, emotional or physical,\nand you got sick, that\nwouldn't make any sense.\nIt's usually after\nyou're stressed.\nIf you've ever been go, go, go,\nor taking care of a loved one\nor studying or working hard,\nand then you finally go\non vacation, you rest, you\narrive, and you get sick,\nit's because your\nimmune system shut down.\nIt stopped.\nYour immune system is mobilized\nby that alertness side\nof your autonomic nervous\nsystem, but you do need sleep.\nYou do need sleep,\nand it's actually,\nwe think, the slowing\nof circulation.\nAnd this is why it's\nprobably not a good idea\nto exercise if\nyou're already sick,\nand if you're\nveering towards sick\nprobably limit the intensity\nof any kind of interaction\nas best you can and\njust still yourself.\nWell, Ali's lab has clearly\nshown us over and over again\nthat what we know, our\nknowledge base, really\ndoes shape the physiology\nover those outcomes.\nNow, you know that stress\nis both bad and good,\nso which one is it?\nDoes it average to nothing?\nNo.\nIt turns out that\nyou can bias this\nin one direction or the other,\ndepending on which information\nyou're listening to more often.\nI think this is\nreally important.\nI still am trying to\nget my head and my mind\naround what's happened\nover the last few years\nand where it's placed us.\nLike where did it land us?\nAre we more resilient now, or\nare we just really beat up?\nI don't know.\nI really don't know,\nbut I think how\nwe interpret the\nlast few years is\ngoing to make a big difference\nin terms of how it impacts us.\nHow do we know if we are--\nthanks, yeah.\nWhat we're missing\nout there, I think,\nis a narrative from somebody\nthat people listen to.\nAnd I'm not saying that\nperson should be me.\nIn fact, it shouldn't be me but\nsomebody that can help us frame\nwhat's just happened to\nus, much like a good--\nI think the world needs a\ngood therapist, basically.\nNeeds a very good therapist.\nSo I would call\nshort-term stress, which\nis very beneficial for us,\nis the kind of stress that\nhappens on the order of a\nday, two, or three days.\nNot a problem.\nEven if you feel torn\napart, provided you can get\nrest afterwards.\nLong-term stress is\nthe kind of stress\nthat really starts to impede\nyour sleep-wake cycle,\nmake your dreams more stressful\nand more like nightmares,\nand they're not going away.\nAnd I can promise you\nthat for those of you that\nhave challenges with\naccumulation of stress\nfrom the past that's now\ncompounded by what's happening\nnow, et cetera,\nthe solution does\nseem to be to get yourself\ninto a supported environment\nof some kind that will allow you\nto go through a full catharsis.\nAgain, it doesn't have\nto require psychedelics.\nThat can take you\nthrough the full ride\nof autonomic intensity--\ncatharsis of some sort--\nand then relaxation.\nThat does seem to be\nwhat snaps people out\nof what we would call\nlonger term stress\nand historical stress.\nThere's even the question\nof whether or not\nfocusing directly on the trauma\nand the story is so critical.\nI think it is.\nObviously that's\nsomething that should\nbe done with a\nclinician, but stress\nthat impedes your sleep for\nthree nights or more, that\nshifts the pattern of dreams\nto more anxious dreams, that\nis more long-term stress.\nAnd for that, you need\nto take it seriously,\nand it's the kind of thing where\nif you don't take it seriously,\nit can start degrading things\nlike your immune system,\net cetera.\nAnd I would say that\nunder those conditions,\nuse sleep as a good marker.\nIn fact, I'm sure there are\nsome clinicians in the room.\nI mean, one of the questions\nthat is used as a diagnostic\nfor whether or not\npeople are depressed\nor anxiously depressed\nis whether or not\nthey are sleeping well or not.\nAgain, language is not\nvery good at parsing\nwhat's going on inside.\nWe have to look to\nbehaviors and regularity\nof sleep-wake cycles, et cetera.\nHopefully that was at\nleast a partial answer.\nI tried to be accurate,\nbut if I were exhaustive,\nI might actually\ncure insomnia someday\nwith these podcasts\nif nothing else.\nHow has hypnosis been\nimpacting my life?\nI'm in hypnosis.\nNo, the-- I actually spent most\nof the afternoon in hypnosis.\nBefore I do these, I spend\na good hour in hypnosis.\nAgain, self-directed hypnosis--\ngosh, it's so unfortunate.\nI keep talking to David\nSpiegel about this.\nAgain, his dad was\none of the originators\nof hypnosis as a valid\npsychiatric treatment.\nThere's even the\nidea that things\nlike EMDR, the scanning\nof eyes back and forth\nwhile reporting a\nnarrative, may actually\nbe capturing some of the\nelements of hypnosis.\nAgain-- and this is\nwhy, at least for me,\nI appreciate the opportunity\nto come together tonight\nto talk about principles.\nI would hope that\nafter tonight, you\ncould look at any\npractice, anything,\nany compound, any\nbreathing exercise,\nand just be able\nto frame up which\ncontinuum, where\non the continuum,\nwhat's it really designed to do.\nMove you up towards alertness\nor down towards calm.\nAnd in fact, because\nI can't help myself,\nI'll just tell you for\nall the breathing stuff,\nit can be made very simple.\nIf your exhales\nare longer and more\nvigorous than your inhales,\nyou're going to get calm down.\nIf your inhales\nare longer and more\nvigorous than your\nexhales, you're\ngoing to become more alert.\nAnd if you hold your\nbreath, just eventually\njust start breathing again.\nThe physiology maps\nperfectly to that.\nThat maps perfectly\nto the physiology.\nAnd if, for instance, you do\nbox breathing-- inhale hold,\nexhale holding, and\nthis kind of thing--\nwell, you're going to stay\nright where you're at.\nYou're going to be on an\neven plane more or less.\nSo that hopefully captures all\nof breathwork in one sentence.\nNow, I'll answer the\nquestion you were asking me.\nHypnosis, it's impact in my\nlife in a couple of ways.\nOne way is more from a\npractical scientific way, which\nis that my laboratory works on\nvision, and we work on stress.\nAnd in some ways, those\nmight seem divorced.\nAlthough now with the\ncuttlefish and the fact\nthat your eyes narrow\ntheir field of view\nwhen you're stressed,\net cetera, it\nshould become\nobvious why that is.\nBut hypnosis also\ntakes advantage\nof this really weird\ncool feature, which is--\nand it's always weird when\nyou do a group exercise,\nbut I can't really\nsee you all that well.\nI certainly can't see your\neyes well enough to know this.\nBut David Spiegel, there's\nactually something in the--\nthis is a valid thing called\nthe Spiegel Eye Roll Test,\nand it's not the\nteenage eye roll.\nThat when you look up while\nnot moving your head-- when\nyou look up, you\nactually are engaging\ncircuits in your brainstem\nthat are involved\nin generating alertness.\nAnd when you look down\nand your eyes close,\nthe opposite is true.\nYou're engaging circuits in\nthe brain that are taking you\ninto a calmer state.\nNow, wouldn't it be wonderful if\nall you had to do was look down\nand you'd be calm and look\nup and you'd be alert.\nThat doesn't quite\nwork that way.\nBut to induce\nhypnosis, what they do\nis they have people look up,\nand then while looking up,\nclose their eyes, which\nis actually hard to do.\nSome people can't do it.\nTheir eyes roll forward, hence\nthe Spiegel Eye Roll Test.\nSome people, their\neyes get-- you\nsee the whites of their eyes,\nand it looks really spooky,\nand they're looking up\nwhile their eyes closed.\nThose people are very\nprone to hypnosis.\nWhy?\nWell hypnosis is a\nstate of deep relaxation\nwith alertness and focus.\nIt's a contextual\nnarrowing-- excuse me.\nSo it's like being\nin early stage sleep,\nand that's why stage hypnosis\nworks with telling people\nto do certain things.\nIt's not that they\ndon't care or they're\nunder the control\nof the hypnotist.\nIt's that they forget\nwhat's around them.\nWhy?\nBecause their mind is focused\ninternally and on the dialogue\nwith the hypnotist and is not\npaying attention to context.\nSo it's a narrowing of context.\nBut hypnosis for me has\nbeen very useful because A,\nit validated the relationship\nbetween vision and states\nof mind.\nIt also checks off\nthis box, again,\nwhich is that to\naccess neuroplasticity,\nwhat do you need?\nYou need focus plus you need\na state of deep relaxation.\nUsually, first focus then\nsleep or non-sleep deep rest.\nBut Spiegel and his\ndaddy figured out\nbecause they're way smarter than\nI am that you can get people\ninto that perfect state\nof neuroplasticity\nby combining them\nboth in real time\nthrough this atypical\nthing we call hypnosis.\nSo I do daily or maybe every\nother day hypnosis script\nthat's about-- it's\nself-directed hypnosis\nscript of about 5 to\n15 minutes, usually,\ntrying to get myself to be\nless pissed off about something\nthat I'm really pissed\noff about, frankly.\nI imagine the stuff\nI'm really pissed off\nabout in the screen\non the left side.\nI think about all the things\nthat make me feel good,\nand then I keep thinking\nabout how angry I am.\nThis is really how it goes.\nAnd then over time,\nI've noticed, well,\nyou're coupling that\nbodily state of calm\nto the anger thing.\nThis is all very hard\nto do in talk therapy.\nNo disrespect to talk therapy.\nThere's a tremendous advantage\nto talk therapy that I myself\nhave benefited from\nit, although according\nto certain people in\nmy life not enough.\nBut hypnosis works\nbecause it's capturing\nneuroplasticity processes.\nThank you for that question.\nWhat are the most\neffective protocols\nfor boosting the microbiome?\nOh.\nWell, here, I'm very\nfortunate because my upstairs\nneighbor at Stanford is the\ngreat Justin Sonnenburg,\nand he and his wife Erika\nrun this amazing lab defining\nall the principles of\nthe gut microbiome,\nand they have a\nreally cool idea.\nI don't know if he's\nserious about this,\nbut I can't help\nbut chuckle when\nI think that this\nmight actually be true.\nWe all know-- this\nis definitely true--\nthat we all carry\naround trillions\nof little micro-bacteria.\nNot just in our gut--\nthat goes from one\nend of our throat\nto the other-- any\nmucosal lining.\nEyes, genitalia, nose--\nwe have microbiomes\nin our nose, et cetera.\nThis is why we're heading\ninto the winter months\nbeing a nasal breather.\nThat sounds like crazy new agey\nstuff-- be a nasal breather.\nThere's actually a book written\nby Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn\nat Stanford with a foreword\nby Jared Diamond and Robert\nSapolsky.\nThe book, Jaws, so these\nare some heavy hitters.\nAnd there's very good evidence\nthat people who mouth breathe\nare making themselves\nmore prone to illness\nwhen nasal breathing\nbecause of the microbiome.\nIt's just a better\nfilter for germs.\nSo this winter and always really\ntry and be a nasal breather\nall the time.\nOne of the best ways to do that\nif you're not into the mouth\ntaping thing,\nwhich people do, is\nto try and do some\nof your exercise\nwith just nasal breathing.\nIt'll take a little\nwhile to get used to,\nbut I'm not good at the\nnasal breathing thing\nbecause I'm always talking.\nThe microbiome is all\nover us and in us.\nIt's on our skin.\nWe're actually exchanging\nit when we meet\nand we shake hands.\nDo you know what happens usually\nin the first 10, 15 seconds?\nData from Noam Sobel's\nlab at the Weizmann\nhas shown that we wipe our eyes.\nWe wipe other people's\nmolecules on us.\nWe're really good at that.\nJust watch these interactions.\nNow, everyone's going be\ndoing the germ free handshake.\nThey're going to be fist bump.\nBut there is this idea that\nmaybe we are the house cats.\nMaybe we're not\njust transporting\nall these microbiota\nbecause it's good for us.\nWhat if we're just the vehicles,\nand they're running the planet?\nAnd they're like, oh, we're\nrunning out of some stuff.\nLike we should figure out\nsomebody to take us to Mars,\nand then we'll take over Mars.\nI mean, maybe it's all them.\nAnd Justin was the\none that told me that,\nand I was like, that's kind of\neerie if you think about it.\nBut there might be these\nother intelligences that\nare hijacking us,\nand that's scary\nbecause we like to think that\nwe're in charge, and who knows.\nWhat's good for your microbiome,\nor what's good for them\nthat is?\nWell, prebiotic fiber\nseems to be very important,\nbut the studies of\nfiber, at least,\nas it relates to the microbiome\nare somewhat controversial.\nThere was a study done\non humans at Stanford\nby Chris Gardner and\nJustin Sonnenburg\nthat showed that people\nwho eat one to four--\nyou have to ramp up--\nservings of low sugar\nfermented foods.\nThis would be your kimchi,\nyour natos, your sauerkraut,\nyour kiefer's, your\nkombuchas, et cetera.\nPer day develop a very\nrobust microbiome,\nand fiber did not do that.\nIn fact, fiber increased\nthe so-called inflammatory,\nwhich is the markers\nfor inflammation,\nbut that doesn't mean\nthat fiber is bad.\nFiber actually is--\ngetting enough fiber\nis correlated with a\nnumber of other things\nthat are great, like reduced\ncardiovascular disease,\nfor instance, cancers of\nthe colon, for instance--\nso fiber and gut microbiota.\nPrebiotics, probiotics,\nprobably only necessary\nif you have a dysbiosis-- if\nyou've been taking antibiotics,\nor if for some reason you're\ndepleted of the microbiome.\nOne of the great ways to\ndeplete your microbiome\nis to just eat highly\nprocessed foods,\nbut hopefully most\npeople aren't doing that.\nSo prebiotic fiber and these\nlow-sugar fermented foods,\nand then someone\nalways says beer.\nSo and always, yes.\nYes, beer will support\nyour microbiome,\nbut it might do\nother things too.\nSo in general, low-alcohol,\nlow-sugar fermented foods\nreduce the number of\ninflammatory markers.\nThat's very, very clear\nfrom the Sonnenburg data.\nAnd then there are\nother ways, of course.\nThe microbiome, actually,\ninteracts with temperature.\nSo the cold exposure\nthing is actually\ngood for your microbiome, but--\nand I want to really\nemphasize this.\nIf you hear about studies\nthat such and such improves\nsuch and such, keep\nin mind that anything\nthat improves your\nsleep, your microbiome,\nor your social\ninteractions will improve\nbasically everything else.\nAnd those are what we call\nmodulating-- excuse me--\neffects, not mediating effects.\nThis is really important, and\nwe teach first year graduate\nstudents and medical\nstudents about this.\nLike for instance, if there were\na fire alarm pulled right now--\nGod forbid-- it would modulate\nall of your attention,\nbut would you say that fire\nalarms mediate Attention No.\nIt's not directly in\nthe line of mechanism,\nbut it can adjust an\nexisting mechanism.\nSo great sleep is\ngreat for everything,\nbut it doesn't\ncontrol it directly.\nAnd so things like\ngetting great sleep,\nkeeping your microbiome healthy,\ngetting enough sunlight,\net cetera-- they provide\na kind of buoyancy\nto all the organs and\nsystems of your body,\nbut they aren't necessarily\nthe thing that cures ADHD.\nBut of course, if you have\nADHD or issues with focus,\ngetting enough sleep will help.\nIs nutrition the way\nto cure your ADHD?\nNo, but if you improve\nyour gut microbiome,\nit's very likely that your\nneurotransmitter systems\nwill improve.\nLimiting sugar will help,\net cetera, et cetera.\nSo there's reason to think that\ngreat sleep, solid nutrition,\nmicrobiome, social\ninteractions, exercise--\nthose are the big five.\nThere are others too, of course.\nWith those you set\na good buoyancy\nto all the other\nsystems, and then we\nget into the things of\nhow to directly increase\nfocus or modulate dopamine\nand so on and so forth.\nOh.\n[LAUGHTER]\nWell, I realize some\npeople are afraid of dogs.\nWe actually have a dog\nstimulus in our fear lab.\nWe get people that\nare terrified of dogs.\nWe hired this dog\ntrainer guy who\nhas these pit bulls that will\nattack you while you're in VR.\nBy the end, people are a\nlittle more comfortable\nwith dogs in general.\nFor you and me, if you're\nnot afraid of dogs,\nthat's not terribly terrifying.\nBut if you are, even\nthe thought of that\ncan be pretty terrifying.\nA couple of things-- people have\nthought about the eye contact\nthing.\nThey make eye contact.\nWe're big on eye contact.\nHumans too.\nEye contact is meaningful in\nterms of oxytocin release.\nThat's all real.\nThose data are-- the\nmore and more data\nthat come out from better\nstudies-- eye contact is\na big deal.\nI think it's also that\njust the dogs are always\ngame to show up exactly\nwhere you want to meet them,\nand they always show up in\ntheir most loving possible state\nfor them.\nIt's a pretty simple\nequation if you get it right.\nThey need proper care, but--\nI mean, Costello was unique\nbecause the bulldog also--\nyou don't want to get\nme going on dog breeds,\nbut the bulldog also looks\ndisappointed all the time.\nAnd then you do\nsomething it likes,\nand then it looks delighted,\nand pretty soon you're\nworking for their approval.\nAnd we were like\nthe odd couple--\nme and him.\nAnd I realize he's got me\ntrained really, really well\nto do my best to please\nhim and delight him,\nwhich delighted me.\nAnd there I was on the hook.\nSo that's one reason.\nI think there's also\nanother reason, which\nis super nerdy, which\nis this C tactile fiber\nthing, which is you\nhave these little nerve\nendings in your skin.\nAnd we know, of course,\nthat oxytocin is\nreleased from parent and child.\nWe know this from\nneuroimaging, et cetera.\nWe know oxytocin is released\nfrom non-sexual romantic touch.\nOne of the things that is\nvery powerful for the release\nof oxytocin-- very powerful--\nis non-sexual grooming touch\namong members of a species\nor even across species.\nSo those pictures of monkeys\npicking around in each other,\nor people who insist on\npopping things on one another,\nor people who go to the\nhairdresser or the barber\nand they like touch.\nIt doesn't even\nhave to be massage--\nmassive oxytocin release.\nThose data don't\nget as much play\nas all the data on\noxytocin and love.\nIt's called the love\nhormone, but it's\nbasically a neurochemical\nsignaling system\nfor this interaction, feels\ngood, and is very much\nof the present.\nAnd I think that's an\nimportant distinction\nto make more broadly.\nIs that dopamine is really\nabout the pursuit of all things\nbeyond the confines of our skin.\nI'm going to get that thing.\nI want that because it's\nall about anticipation.\nAnd when you have some\ndistance between yourself\nand the thing that you\nthink will deliver,\nwhatever it is you\nwant, usually pleasure\nin some form or another,\nor excitement, whatever\nyour pleasure is or\ncombined, then you actually\nhave to mobilize.\nAnd dopamine is the\nprecursor to adrenaline.\nA lot of people don't know that.\nAdrenaline is made\nfrom dopamine.\nIt gets you into motion.\nThen you have the\nreward systems that\nare more about what you have\nfrom your skin surface inward.\nSo this is gentle\ntouch, holding hands,\nand indeed stroking your dog.\nProbably does that for you.\nIt activates these C\nfibers, as they're called,\nin your skin, which feed\nright into these serotonin\nand oxytocin system.\nSo the brain-- sounds a\nlittle pop psychology-ish,\nbut it's a real thing, and\nit exists in essentially all\nmammalian species.\nSo I think a lot of us just\nlike dogs because they'll\nlet us just pet them all day.\nSome people like to be touched\na little bit more or less,\neven when they trust is all--\nit's this consensual,\nage appropriate, context\nappropriate-- in this\ncase, species appropriate.\nThose are the conditions,\nvery important.\nWhen I was a kid, I had--\nI don't know why.\nMy sister is in the audience.\nI don't why she decided to\ndo this in the first place,\nbut I loved having\nmy face done--\npet like that.\nI still like it,\nbut don't try it\nbecause she's the only one--\nshe can't do it anymore even.\nSo we all have these\nthings that feel good,\nand I think it feels\ngood because it\nreleases these chemicals.\nAnd these are ancient systems--\nancient, ancient systems that\nwe all have, and I think dogs\nlet us do that.\nAnd cats toy with\nus with this one.\nBecause there are those\ncats that let you pet them,\nbut most of the time\nthey're doing it to you,\nand then they withdraw.\nAnd I don't know many\ndogs that do that.\nSo I think people, I'm going\nto answer the question finally.\nI think dogs we love them\nso much because they let\nus pet them as much as we want.\nAnd cats play this\nvery diabolical game\nthat's a lot more like\nhuman relationships.\n[LAUGHTER]\nHow can night owls best\nfunction in a society\nmade for morning birds?\nCan you change your\nchronotype or do us night\nowls just have to suffer?\nOK.\nWell, as a former\nnight owl, I used\nto work long hours in the lab.\nI still work long hours\nbut less in the lab.\nJust so happens that's\nthe way the career goes.\nI'd put tinfoil on the windows.\nI would lock the doors.\nI'd blast the music, and I would\nstay there over the holidays,\nuntil I had to go home just\nfor the holiday events,\nand my clock would drift.\nSo I became a night owl, and\nthen my clock would flip,\nand everyone was gone.\nYour mind gets really\ntweaked when you're not\ninteracting with anybody.\nBy the way, seeing faces\nin the morning and seeing\nfaces at some point\nduring the day\nonce you're ready to face\nthe day, very important\nfor mental health.\nThis is something I wish\nmore people knew about.\nIt also-- and here,\nI'm not trying\nto evoke any sentimentality.\nBut when you think about\npeople who just are clearly\nnot doing well, whether\nor not they have shelter\nor not-- it's how often do\nwe actually make direct eye\ncontact nowadays?\nIt's not very often.\nSo eye contact is important,\nbut I've also shifted\nto being a morning person.\nSo here's the thing-- if you\nare a true night owl, that\nmeans that your circadian clock,\nmeaning the genes that control\nthe area of your brain\nand your hypothalamus that\ncontrols wake-sleep cycles,\nis fundamentally different.\nVery unlikely you'll\nbecome a morning person\nwithout being a kind of\nangry morning person.\nSo you can use that argument,\nand you can cite me.\nHowever, as we get\nolder, it is true\nthat the amount of slow\nwave sleep to REM sleep\ntends to change,\nand we can do better\non shorter bouts\nof sleep, mostly\nbecause we're getting less\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd even if we try, we can't.\nThose people would\nprobably be better off\nsticking to a limited\namount of sleep at night,\nand then getting a short nap.\nThe rule of naps is\nnap if you want to.\nDon't if you don't want,\nbut not if it interferes\nwith your nighttime sleep.\nAnd if you can't nap, do some\nsort of non-sleep deep breaths\nor NSDRs.\nI refer to it as\nnon-sleep depressed.\nSo you can probably shift\nyour clock by anywhere\nfrom two to eight hours, and\nthat's true for lag as well.\nLight is going to\nbe the best way,\nbut if you really\nwant to shift, you're\ngoing to have to stack\nthe big three or four.\nLight-- so get light when\nyou want to be awake.\nTemperature-- you have to\nincrease your body temperature\nto wake up.\nYou have to decrease body\ntemperature to go to sleep.\nKeep in mind if you get into\nan ice bath or cold shower,\nyou get very, very\ncold, but then\nwhat happens it's like putting\nan ice pack on the thermostat.\nYour body temperature goes up.\nRemember, thermogenesis--\nthat's the warming of the body\nin response to cold.\nOf course, if you stay in a long\ntime, you'll get crispy cold.\nYou'll turn into a popsicle.\nBut the idea is that if\nyou take a cold shower,\nand you get some bright light,\nand you get some exercise,\nand you drink some caffeine,\nyou can train your system\nto expect that at a\ncertain time of day--\nand you'll want to go to sleep\na little bit earlier or much\nearlier, and you'll want to wake\nup when you stack those things.\nBut that also means not taking\ncaffeine and cold showers\nand doing exercise\nlate at night,\nso it's going to take some work.\nBut those are the big four.\nIt's going to be light.\nIt's the most\npowerful way to shift.\nMore light, awake.\nLess light, asleep.\nTemperature increase, awake.\nTemperature decrease, asleep.\nFood is the other one.\nEating-- you can force\nyourself to eat breakfast,\neven if you're not\na breakfast eater.\nThis works when you travel too.\nJust get on to the\nlocal meal schedule.\nBecause you have a clock system\nin your gut, believe it or not.\nYou want to synchronize\nthat with your brain.\nAnd then activity-- getting\nsome sort of exercise.\nBut it takes a little bit\nof work, but you can do it.\nYou can definitely do it.\nIf you're nocturnal,\nthat's weird,\nunless it's because of\nyour work, in which case\nthere are tools for shift\nwork that we've put out there\non the podcast.\nYour podcasts has\nbeen a wild success.\nHow do you see it growing\nover the next few years?\nHonestly, I try in\nthe tunnel of lack\nof understanding and\nawareness about what's\nhappening with all this.\nI really do.\nLex suggested we do the podcast.\nThat's a true story of doing it.\nI still really do\nfeel very much like I\ndid when I was a little kid.\nI'm just going to keep\ntrying to learn and share.\nI'd love for people\nto share the tools.\nI don't want credit for them.\nIf people credit us, great.\nBut if you think about it--\nmost of what we talk about\nare not things that you buy.\nThese are tools that, again,\nwork the first time every time.\nI always say\nbehavioral tools first,\nthen nutrition, supplementation.\nAnd then for some people,\nprescription drugs\nor some of these more\nexperimental drugs make sense.\nFor some people it doesn't.\nFor instance, I don't think kids\nshould be doing psychedelics.\nI mean, childhood is enough\nof a psychedelic experience\nin and of itself.\nBut I had an amazing clinician--\nhe's actually a triple-board\ncertified psychiatrist\nneurologist at Stanford Nolan\nWilliams on the podcast--\nand he talked about even the\nuse of ibogaine and MDMA,\neven in some younger\npopulations but again,\nwith therapeutic oversight.\nIt blew my mind.\nI also didn't know this--\nthat MDMA I thought was toxic.\nPlease don't just take\nit off the street,\nbut if you're interested\nin clinical trials,\nthere are great clinical\ntrials happening through maps,\nand you can look at\nNolan's website as well.\nMost of the knowledge\nabout the effects of MDMA\nis from the LDS community\nbecause they volunteered\nfor these studies because it's\nnot on the banned substance\nlist.\nAnd so there's a\nlot of knowledge,\nand they don't tend to-- or\nthey don't use other substances,\nlike alcohol and\nmarijuana and cocaine.\nSo much of what we know\nabout the effects of MDMA\non the body and brain\nis from that community.\nOther communities too as well.\nSo what are we going\nto do with the podcast?\nWell, every Monday I'm going\nto keep putting out episodes,\nuntil they put me in that\ngrave with the thing.\nThank you.\nYeah.\nIt is a labor of love,\nand it's a lot of fun.\nAnd we're just always trying\nto make them better, clearer.\nSomehow they're not\ngetting shorter.\nI always tell Rob-- this one\nis going to be 90 minutes.\nAnd he's like, yeah.\nI'll believe it when I see it.\nI think for me one\nthing that has brought\nthat's really wonderful\nis the opportunity\nto learn from people\nin other domains\nthat are far better\nat putting information\nand things into the world.\nSo I've been-- I hope he\ndoesn't mind me saying this.\nI've been very blessed--\nI've become really good\nfriends with Rick Rubin, who's\nbeen really helpful to me.\nHe has an amazing book\non creativity coming out\nthat's not a plug for the\nbook, although I guess\nI just accidentally did it.\nBut Rick of course,\nis like producing.\nCreated all this amazing music.\nEverything from like Run-DMC,\nBeastie Boys, Slayer,\nJohnny Cash, everything.\nJust amazing.\nAnd one of the things that\nhe's been impressing on me\nis that it's very\nimportant to stay focused\non the process of\nwhat you're doing\nand to really not get into too\nmuch of how that's landing.\nSo I do like to hear when\nthings are not clear.\nThat's really helpful to me.\nI do like to hear suggestions\nabout great people\nto bring on the podcast.\nI love criticism\nmost of the time.\nI try my-- it's hard\nsometimes, but I really\ntry and just absorb\nit for what it is.\nBut I love that aspect\nof interacting in this,\neven though this is very\nfairly unidirectional.\nHopefully, there'll be more\nopportunities for dialoguing\nand learning what's out there.\nMy real hope is that\npractitioners will\nstart to incorporate things.\nAnd again, it's not about me.\nI'm gleaning from fields and\ndiscoveries of other people\nand trying to thread\nacross fields.\nSo that's why I see the podcast\ngoing just more of the same,\nmore of the same, more of\nthe same but a lot more\nand more topics as best\nwe can-- lots of guests.\nAnd we actually have an\nepisode with Rick coming out\nat some point about\ncreativity, which\nI think is one of the\nmore interesting aspects\nof our being, so watch for that.\nWhat is a stress inoculation\nprotocol for workplace anxiety\n(speaking)?\nDoes the principle of staying\ncalm under high adrenaline\nstate-- yeah, definitely.\nI think if you were to\npick some sort of practice\nthat you could do\nprivately and safely--\nagain, how cold should\nyou make the water?\nCold enough that it's\nreally uncomfortable\nand you really,\nreally want to get out\nbut you can safely stay in.\nAnd that's why we never say\n40 degrees because you can't\nkill yourself with cold water.\nIt's just hard to do.\nYou have to get really, really\ncold before you kill yourself.\nAnd open bodies of\nwater aren't good.\nActually, I told my\nfriend Samer Hattar.\nHe's the director of\nchronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof mental health.\nHe came on the podcast.\nGot him really-- he's\ngreat about all the stuff\non light and sleep.\nTaught me a lot of\nthat over the years.\nWe're good friends.\nI told him about the\ncold water thing,\nand he got into some river in\nBethesda and almost drowned.\nAnd Sam right now-- he has\na story about how he almost\ndrowned, and what he was--\nand he thought about a paper\nhe wanted to write while\nhe was almost drowning.\nSo just be careful-- open bodies\nof water, that kind of thing.\nBut I think you can quickly\nsee within about a week or so\nof doing some sort of\ndeliberate adrenaline release.\nIt could be cyclic\nhyperventilation,\n25 hyperventilated breaths\nwith a short breath hold,\nrepeat, done two or three times.\nWe have good data to\nsupport that in the lab.\nYou see massive shifts in\npeople's baseline level.\nYou become a little\nbit more like Costello.\nYou really do.\nAnd the way to think about it\nis, if you are more on a seesaw\nthen on the continuum, you get\nbetter at loosening that hinge\nand controlling that hinge.\nOr you can imagine moving\nup and down that seesaw\na little bit more easily.\nAnd then of course, you\nhave to place yourself\ninto the environment.\nYou have to test yourself\nin that environment,\nand some people will do\nToastmasters and things\nlike that, and it can work.\nMy way-- I don't know if\nit works for everybody.\nMy way is just start talking.\nDon't stop.\nI can't feel the stress.\nWhat do you think will\nbe the next hot topic/new\ntrend in the field of\nneuroscience behavioral\ntherapeutics?\nOoh, I like that because I have\na lot of opinions about that.\nFirst of all, I do\nnot think it's going\nto be brain machine interface.\nMy good friend, Eddie Chang, who\nI've known since we were nine,\nhe came on the podcast.\nHe works on epilepsy.\nHe's a chair of neurosurgery.\nWe had a bird club when we\nwere kids at two members.\nYou had to know the names\nof all the talking birds,\nand then you had to know\nwhich one was the best talker,\nand it's the minor bird.\nAnd of course, no\none wanted to join.\nNo one even took the test.\nBut he became a neurosurgeon and\ndoes brain machine interface.\nHe's doing truly incredible\nwork getting people\nwith locked in syndrome to\nspeak through a device implanted\nunder the skull.\nThey just think what\nthey want to say.\nThese are people who\nhaven't moved or shared\na word with anybody, and\nthey're now communicating,\nbut here's what's\nreally cool and--\nhe has also realized that\nfacial expression is a lot.\nIt's one thing to\nsee on a screen what\nsomebody in a chair or a\nhospital bed is thinking.\nThat's wonderful,\nbut facial expression\nis such a rich part of this.\nSo this is a really\ngood use of AI.\nHe's now created very\nrealistic iPad images\nof that person's face,\nand so they're actually\nspeaking the words.\nAnd people form a\ndeep relationship\nto the person who's right\nnext to their avatar,\nso that's a positive\nuse, I think, of avatars,\nand Eddie is doing amazing work.\nThat kind of work-- a brain\nmachine interface neural link,\net cetera, I think is going\nto be very useful and popular\nin the realm of therapeutics\nfor Parkinson's, movement\ndisorders, epilepsy,\nlocked-in syndrome, et cetera.\nI think we are many, many, many\ndecades from chip implantation\ninto the brain for things\nlike enhancing memory,\nand frankly I wouldn't want it.\nNot because I wouldn't\nwant to enhance my memory,\nbut because of what\nI said earlier.\nIs that the nervous system has\na certain amount of real estate,\nand you don't want to make\nthat real estate very lopsided.\nAnd so I think we're going to\nsee something very different\nin the next 10, 20\nyears, and I hope, hope,\nhope this carries over\nto younger populations.\nI think we're going\nto hopefully start\nlearning about our nervous\nsystem and what it can do.\nAnd the fact that we have these\npre-existing circuits in us\nthat we can learn\nto leverage that\nwork first time every time.\nSo I'm strongly\nbiased in my answer,\nbut I think that it still\nremains an open question,\nfor instance, whether or not\npeople could require less\nperhaps or no medication\nfor certain things.\nAnd I say certain things\nbecause for conditions\nlike schizophrenia, bipolar\nin particular medication,\nOCD has proved very effective.\nBut then there are\na whole other set\nof conditions like\ndepression and anxiety\nfor which behavioral\ntools really work,\nbut most people just don't\neven know they exist.\nSo that's my hope, and again,\nthe therapeutic community\ncould try and expand\ntheir toolkit.\nI also think we're\nstarting to see\na blurring of the lines between\ndifferent fields of psychology,\nso it's no longer\npsychoanalytic versus\ncognitive behavioral\nversus dialectic\nversus EMDR versus hypnosis.\nThat it's all going\nto be governed\nby some central principles.\nAll those camps-- it's\njust silly frankly to me.\nIt makes sense academically\nwhy those came to be,\nbut in neuroscience\nwe had the same thing.\nYou used to have to pick.\nIt was like a John Hughes\nfilm from the '80s.\nAre you going to be a jock\nor a punker or a popular kid.\nNow, it's not like that,\nand half this audience\nis looking at me like,\nwhat are you talking about?\nAnd that's exactly the point.\nWhich is that I'll\nnever forget I grew up\nin the skateboard thing.\nThe first time I saw someone\nwearing skateboarding shoes,\nI was like, damn.\nThey skateboard.\nAnd they're like, no.\nThey just-- people are\njust wearing this stuff.\nSo well, you start to realize\nit's all blended together,\nwhich is great.\nAnd in the field\nof neuroscience,\nyou used to have to pick.\nAre you an anatomist\nor a physiologist?\nAre you into neural computation?\nNow, your lab has to do it all,\nor you collaborate with people.\nThose divisions\nhave really melted\nbecause people are\ninterested in questions,\nand they're\ninterested in answers.\nAnd don't get me started,\nbut the careerism\nof the requirement\nfor everyone to have\ntheir own independent\nlaboratory and say this\nis my mission, that is one of\nthe worst things about science.\nBecause everything we know\nsays that collaboration\ncollaboration, collaboration,\nleads to faster progress.\nAnd I'm not going to take on\nthe whole academic system.\nIt's been very\ngood to me, but I'd\nlike to see a blurring\nof the boundaries.\nIt used to be that\nlabs weren't-- here,\nI'm really guilty, Huberman lab.\nBut it used to be that labs were\nnamed after the problem they\nworked on.\nVision Lab, Stress\nLab, Happiness Lab.\nI like that quite\na bit more, but I\nscrewed up and called this\nwhole thing the Huberman Lab.\n[LAUGHTER]\nYou have had a number\nof performance interests\nand fitness experts\non your show.\nWhat changes have you made\nto your fitness protocol,\nincluding nutrition?\nOh.\nYeah.\nWell, I'm an omnivore,\nso I like those things\nthey call carbohydrates, and\nI eat them in moderation.\nAnd so I've never really been\ntoo extreme about any of this,\nor the fasting thing,\nalthough I do just--\nI'm not very hungry\nin the morning.\nThat's also because I like\nto eat a lot at night.\nI wake up not that hungry.\nSo what have I changed?\nWell, in terms of\nthe fitness stuff,\nI've definitely\nstarted to incorporate\nmore nasal breathing when I do\ncardiovascular work because it\nhas eliminated any\nsleep apnea I had.\nAnd sleep apnea is\nvery, very bad--\nvery, very bad.\nI wish I could say\nsnoring was no big deal,\nbut we know based on work at the\nStanford Sleep Lab, Penn Sleep\nLab, other sleep labs that\npeople who have sleep apnea\nare really in for trouble\nfor a number of reasons.\nSo you want to learn\nto be a nasal breather,\nand if-- some people\nwill tape their mouth\nshut with medical tape\nwhen they go to sleep.\nOther people will just start\ndoing cardiovascular work,\nkeeping their mouth closed.\nAnd that requires that\nyou not go too intensely,\nbut it does create a dilation\nof the nasal passages.\nThose sinuses can dilate.\nSo I've definitely done that.\nAnd at the end of\ntraining, I try and do\na one-minute or\nthree-minute decompress.\nNot immediately look\nat my phone to learn\nto shift from high\nintensity thinking\nand to lower intensity thinking\nand shift throughout the day.\nTask switching,\nI think, is going\nto be a big area of science\nand neuroscience in general.\nWe still don't know\nhow to task switch\nwell-- how to shift the\nmind from focus to defocus\nand back again.\nThat's something\nthat-- by the way,\nthis is, I think a rich\nopportunity for people\nto develop tools.\nWe don't know a lot about that.\nWe got too caught up\non consciousness flow\nand free will.\nAnd that stuff is great, but\nas you can tell, I like tools.\nI like physiology.\nI like the things that\nwork in my lifetime\nand that we can figure out\nand agree upon in my lifetime.\nLet's see.\nGot it.\nAnd I'm told that\nthis final question--\nwhen they put the clock\nup here earlier too,\nthey said we're going to\nrun it for 60 minutes.\nMy first question was,\nwhere's the snooze button?\nSo I'm going to keep\ngoing, but I think\nthey're going to hold me to it.\nAnd I know, people, this\nis New York after all.\nThere are other\nfun things to do.\nFor things that take\na long time-- career,\npursuing a degree--\nis there a right way to know\nthat we're on the right path?\nIs there a way to know\nwe're on the right path?\nThank you for that question.\nI get asked this a\nlot, and gosh, there's\nso much information out there.\nSo much information about this.\nWe don't yet have a\ngauge of whether or not\nwe're in too much\nstress or not, but there\nis one tool that's used in\nthe free diving community\nand in other\ncommunities that you\ncan use as a thermometer of\nhow well you're functioning.\nAnd some of you may know\nit already, and if you do,\nforgive me.\nIt's this carbon\ndioxide tolerance test.\nSo why am I answering\nthis question this way?\nWell, I like to start\nwith actionable tools.\nIf, for instance, you were to\njust take three or four breaths\nand then take a big\ndeep breath and then\ndo a very slow\ncontrolled exhale--\ncould be through your nose\nor through your mouth.\nIdeally, through your nose.\nAnd you're trying to make that\nexhale as long as possible,\nuntil your lungs are\nempty, and you time that.\nThat's called the carbon\ndioxide discard rate\nor the exhale discard rate.\nAnd it tells you how well you're\ncontrolling your diaphragm\nusing something called\nthe phrenic nerve.\nIt also tells you how well\nyou're managing carbon dioxide\nand how well you're\nmanaging stress.\nAnd if you're very\nstressed, that number\nwill be very, very short.\nAnd I'm not talking\nabout how long\nyou can sit with lungs empty.\nI'm talking about an honest\nappraisal of how long\nyou can control that exhale for.\nAnd if it's anywhere\nfrom 0 to 20 seconds,\nyour stress level is high.\nAnd if it's from 20 to 40\nseconds, it's moderate.\nAnd longer than 40\nseconds means you\nhave good control over\nyour carbon dioxide system,\nmore or less.\nNow, these are averages,\nand guess what?\nHas nothing to do with\nfitness, and also, it\nhas nothing to do with you per\nse because if you do this when\nyou first wake up after\na good night's sleep,\nyou'll have a long discard rate.\nIf you do this after\nrunning, you'll\nhave a short discard rate.\nYou're not out of breath.\nYou're just not managing\nthe system very well.\nSo you can touch into this\nevery once in a while as a blood\npressure reading type thing.\nThis is very back of the\nenvelope it's not perfect,\nbut it works well enough\nthat alongside things\nlike resting heart rate, heart\nrate variability, et cetera,\nyou can get a window into how\nwell you're managing stress.\nWhy am I answering\nthis question this way?\nWell, this is\nsomething I recommend\ndoing every once in\na while, especially\nif you are in a period of a\ncareer or any kind of pursuit\nwhere you are feeling\nlike you're grinding.\nI think once your carbon dioxide\ndiscard rate starts to really\nget shorter and shorter,\nyou're having trouble sleeping,\nI think it's time to focus on\nre-establishing that buoyancy\nto your nervous system\nbecause then and only then can\nyou make good judgments\nabout whether or not\nyou're in the right\ntrajectory for you.\nNow, in terms of the larger\npsychological themes,\nare you doing something that\nbrings you meaning or not?\nThat gets into some\ncomplicated territory.\nWe're very good at assigning\nmeaning retrospectively,\nand saying, well, that\nwas a good experience\nbecause we had it, and we\nlearned from it, et cetera.\nBut I think most people\nwould like to avoid things\nthat they can only\nlook back on and say,\nit was useful because I\nlearned something from it.\nAnd for that, I'll\njust give the default,\nbut I think, at least\nto me, accurate answer,\nwhich is the more\noften that you can\ntap into that feeling of\nexcitement and delight\nin your work, even\nif from small things\nor from surprising things, or\nfrom the social interactions\nthat you're able to\nglean from that work,\nthe longer and better you're\ngoing to be able to pursue\nthat line of work.\nFor me is in graduate\nschool, I was very isolated.\nI worked alone in the lab.\nMaybe it was because\nof the tin foil\nI put on the walls\nor the windows.\nI don't know.\nIn fact, my graduate\nadvisor's one complaint\nwas that I seemed unfriendly.\nI wasn't unfriendly.\nI was just busy, but I got\nto be very good friends\nwith the janitorial\nstaff because they\nwere the only one around\nat the time I was working--\nwere a few other people.\nAnd those small\ninteractions actually became\nvery significant to me and\nbecame sources of brief--\nbut to me, at\nleast, at the time,\nmeaningful social exchange.\nAnd of course,\neventually, I made friends\nand had relationships of\nother kinds and things\nthat were healthy as well.\nBut I think learning to tap into\nthis love of what you're doing\nis sometimes hard, but\nyou have to look for it.\nIt's an active process,\nand I'll default\nto the work and the podcast\nthat's coming with Rick Rubin.\nAnd he is a lot of what he talks\nabout in terms of creativity.\nIs about accessing\nwhat he and others have\ntalked about as the source.\nIf that is an abstract,\nI don't know what is.\nBut the source is this\nability to see yourself\nas more of a portal for\ngetting certain things done\nin the world than\nbeing so careerist\nand focused on whether or\nnot outcomes are really\nmatching what you need.\nIt involves some\nmental flexibility,\nand of course, it's OK\nto pivot back and forth.\nBut we can only\naccess this feeling\nof delight and joy\nand this feeling\nthat we're somehow connected to\nsome larger theme, aka meaning,\nI think, when we are able to be\ncalm enough and not so focused.\nBut in order to\nget anything done,\nwe have to be hyper focused,\nand that brings me back\nto the basic principle of\ntoday's whole discussion, which\nis that it's not\nabout landing yourself\nin a state of focus\nmotivation and drive\nor in a state of deep sleep.\nCertainly, not in a coma.\nIt's about being able to move up\nand down the various continuums\nthat allow you to access\nfocus and real gas\npedal down to the floor\nkind of thinking and action\nbut then also deliberately\nback off transition\nto periods of rest.\nAnd the real key is for\nyou to feel like you're\nin the driver's seat.\nIf we know anything from\nthe last 100-plus years\nof psychology and\nneuroscience literature,\nit's that if an\nanimal or a person\nfeels that they are in control\nof the physiological process\nwithin them, and they know\nthey can get themselves\nout, some way somehow at some\npoint and back into a state\nthat they want somehow,\nsome way, at some point,\nwell, then, all the language\naround meaning and happiness\nand delight starts to emerge.\nSo learn to move along\nthose continuums.\nLearn to do it\ndeliberately, and I wish you\nthe very best of luck in it.\nI know it works.\n[APPLAUSE]\nThank you.\nThanks so much.\nThank you.\n[APPLAUSE]\nThank you.\nThanks so much for coming out.\n[APPLAUSE]\nI really appreciate\nit and grateful\nto our sponsors, of course.\nThank you and to all\nof you for your time.\nI know there's a lot\nto do in the city,\nand I hope everyone enjoys it.\nAnd of course, I'd be\nremiss if I didn't say,\nthank you for your\ninterest in science.\n[CHEERS]\n[MUSIC PLAYING]"
