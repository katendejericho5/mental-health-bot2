    "transcript": "ANDREW HUBERMAN: Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor\nof neurobiology\nand ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is\nDr. Kyle Gillett.\nDr. Kyle Gillett is a dual\nboard certified physician\nin family medicine and\nobesity medicine and an expert\nin hormone optimization.\nHe is an M.D--\nthat is, a medical doctor--\nand he treats patients\nwith a variety\nof backgrounds, ages and goals.\nToday, we discuss male\nhormone optimization.\nWe discuss behavioral tools,\nnutrition-based tools,\nsupplement-based tools,\nprescription-drug-based tools,\nand their interactions in\ndetermining overall levels\nof testosterone,\nfree testosterone,\ndihydrotestosterone, estrogen,\ngrowth hormone, thyroid\nhormone, and many other\nhormones that impact mood,\nlibido, well-being,\nstrength, cognition,\nand various\npsychological factors.\nWe've covered\nhormone optimization\nin both men and women\nin previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab podcast,\nbut today's discussion\nis different.\nDr. Kyle Gillett offers very\nspecific recommendations\nfor people with different\ngoals and of different ages.\nAnd we get deep\ninto the weeds of,\nfor instance, how does\none know whether or not\ntheir testosterone is optimized\nor not, how often to test\nfor specific hormones\nsuch as testosterone\nand other hormones, and\nreally, how to gauge\nhow good one should feel?\nThis is something that's often\noverlooked in discussions\nabout hormone optimization\nor health optimization\nof any kind, for that matter.\nFor instance, people will\ntalk about reduced libido\nand discuss whether or not\ntestosterone levels are\nto blame, but how does\none calibrate their libido\nin the first place?\nThat is, how does one know\nwhether or not their libido is\nnormal, too low, or too high?\nWe also discuss, for\ninstance, whether or not\nhormone optimization should\nbe pursued continually\nthroughout the\nyear-- for instance,\nwhether or not you should\ncycle on and off supplements\nand/or prescription drugs geared\ntowards hormone optimization.\nAnd we discuss the\nbehavioral foundations\nof optimal hormone function.\nThese are things that\nevery male should be doing\nand various things\nthey should actively\navoid if their goal is to\nhave healthy hormones and to,\nquote, unquote, optimize\ntheir levels of every hormone\nfrom growth hormone\nto testosterone\nat any stage of life.\nAnd while today's discussion\nis about male hormone\noptimization, I\nwant to emphasize\nthat we discuss all the\nvarious ages for male hormone\noptimization.\nSo for those of you that are\nparents, for those of you that\nare young, those of you that\nare middle aged, or old,\nor teenagers, we explore\nadolescent, puberty,\nteen and late teens, early\nadulthood, adulthood,\nand into the late\ngeriatric ages.\nSo regardless of\nyour age and whether\nor not you are male or\nfemale, today's episode\nought to be of interest to you.\nI should also point out\nthat we will soon also\nbe hosting an expert guest on\nfemale hormone optimization.\nOne thing that I'm\ncertain people of all ages\nand biological sex will enjoy\nabout today's conversation\nis that we also get\ninto descriptions\nof how psychology and life\nevents impact hormones\nand how hormones impact\nour psychology and the way\nthat we show up to\nvarious life events.\nSo today is really\na broad overview\nthat goes all the way down to\nfine details about male hormone\noptimization.\nAnd I'm certain that by\nthe end of today's episode,\nyou will have an immense amount\nof new information about how\nthis endocrine-- that is,\nhormone system in your body\nworks--\nand how it interacts with\nyour brain and other tissues\nand many, many actionable tools\nthat you can pursue regardless\nof stage of life.\nBefore we begin, I'd\nlike to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to\nconsumer information\nabout science and\nscience-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with\nthat theme, I'd like\nto thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd as I've said many times\nbefore on this podcast,\nI am not a fan of\nthe word nootropics,\nbecause it means smart\ndrugs, and frankly, there\nare no specific neural circuits\nin the brain or body for being,\nquote, unquote, smart.\nThesis understands\nthis, and they've\ndeveloped custom nootropics\nthat are designed\nto bring your brain and\nbody into the state that's\nideal for what you\nneed to accomplish.\nThey use the highest\nquality ingredients-- things\nlike phosphatidylserine,\nalpha GPC, many ingredients\nthat I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast\nand that I happen to use myself.\nI've been using Thesis\nfor over a year now,\nand I can confidently say\nthat their nootropics have\nbeen a game changer.\nFor me, I like their\nnootropic for clarity.\nI used that before\ncognitive work often.\nAnd I like their\nnootropic for energy,\nand I often used\nthat before workouts,\nand in particular, workouts\nthat are especially intense.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman,\ntake their 3-minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you four\ndifferent formulas to\ntry

eyeglasses\nand sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded\nby 2 All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford, and everything\nabout ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system,\nand I can tell you\nthat your visual\nsystem has to contend\nwith an enormous number\nof challenges in order\nfor you to see clearly,\nfor instance, when you move\nfrom a sunny area\nto a shady area\nand back again, whether or not\nyou're looking at something up\nclose or off into the distance.\nROKA understands the biology\nof the visual system,\nand has designed their\neyeglasses and sunglasses\naccordingly so that you always\nsee with perfect clarity.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were initially\ndesigned for activities\nsuch as running and cycling,\nand indeed, they are\nvery lightweight.\nMost of the time, I\ncan't even remember\nthat they're on my face\nthey're so lightweight.\nBut the important thing to\nknow about ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses is\nthat while they\ncan be used during\nsports activities,\nthey also have a\nterrific aesthetic\nand they can be\nused just as well\nfor wearing to work, or\nout to dinner, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to roka--\nthat's R-O-K-A--\n.com

Sleep.\nHelix makes\nmattresses and pillows\nthat are of the absolute\nhighest quality.\nI started sleeping on a Helix\nmattress well over a year ago,\nand it's been the best\nsleep that I've ever had.\nOne of the things that makes\nHelix mattresses so unique\nis that they match the\ndesign of the mattress\nto your unique sleep needs.\nSo for instance, if you\ngo on to their website.\nYou can take a brief quiz.\nIt only takes about\ntwo or three minutes,\nand you'll answer\nquestions like do\nyou tend to run hot or\ncold throughout the night,\nor whether or not you sleep\non your back, your side,\nor your stomach, or\nmaybe you don't know.\nRegardless, they will match\nyou to the custom mattress\nthat ideal for your sleep needs.\nFor me, that was the dusk--\nD-U-S-K-- mattress which,\nfor me, was not too firm,\nnot too soft, and was ideal\nfor my sleep patterns.\nYou take the quiz\nand you'll find out\nwhat mattress is ideal\nfor your sleep patterns.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their brief sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress,\nand you'll get up to $200 off\nany mattress order and two free\npillows.\nThey have a 10 year\nwarranty, and you\nget to try out the mattress\nfor 100 nights risk-free.\nAgain, if you're\ninterested, you can go\nto helixsleep.com/huberman

to\nlivemomentous-- spelled O-U-S--\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just\nmention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now, for my discussion\nwith Dr. Kyle Gillett.\nDr. Gillett, great\nto have you back.\nKYLE GILLETT: Great to be back.\nThank you.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like to\nbegin with a question about one\nof the most mysterious and\nimportant phases of life, which\nis puberty.\nI've long wondered whether or\nnot how quickly somebody goes\ninto puberty-- so at what age--\nand how long puberty\ntakes-- so how\nbrief or protracted\nthat puberty is\nfor them to acquire the\nso-called secondary sexual\ncharacteristics,\nthings like hair growth\non the face for males and\nchanges in bone, and muscle\ndensity, and growth, et cetera.\nWhen I was in middle\nschool and high school,\nI noticed that some people\ntransitioned into all that\nvery fast and some people\ntook a long time to acquire\nthose characteristics.\nCan we learn anything about\nourselves, our hormones,\nand maybe even how\nlong we're going\nto live based on the time\nin which we enter puberty\nand how long it takes us to\nprogress through puberty?\nAnd I guess that also\nraises the question,\ndoes puberty ever truly end?\nKYLE GILLETT: There are\nmany takeaways from puberty.\nSome of the actionable items\nfrom it are, yes, it can\nand does affect your adult\nheight and also stature\nand also body composition.\nSo puberty is a time--\nand if we're talking\nspecifically about males,\nthink of it as a time where,\nif you have obesity as a child,\nyou could potentially\nuse that time\nto change your lifestyle\nand habits and reset things,\nand it is a bit easier.\nIt's almost like\na free injection\nof testosterone and metabolism\nand drive and effort\ninto your life.\nThere is a wide variation in how\nquickly puberty goes through.\nSo there are stages called\nTanner stages, which we don't\nnecessarily need to get into.\nBut if you enter\npuberty very early,\nthen it can decrease your\nadult height or stature.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So for a\ngiven male that enters puberty\nat 13 versus a male that\nenters puberty at 15,\ncan we say that the guy\nthat entered puberty at 13\nis going to be shorter than the\nguy that entered puberty at 15,\nor it's not quite\nthat straightforward?\nKYLE GILLETT: If they\nare identical twins\nand the individual\nwho entered puberty\nat age 13 also finished\npuberty, went all the way\nthrough the Tanner stages--\nand if you do a bone\nscan, which I believe\nis usually done\non the left wrist,\nand it says yes, your growth\nplates are mostly closed,\nyou're not going to grow more\nthan a couple inches of height\nafter that.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Just\na related question.\nWhen I was growing\nup, it was thought,\nor at least people would say,\nthat resistance training--\nin particular,\nlifting heavy weights\ncould stunt one's growth.\nIs that true or false?\nKYLE GILLETT: It is\nfalse when you're\ntalking about just\nlifting heavy weights.\nDirty bulking certainly\nhas the potential to stunt\none's growth for\ntwo main mechanisms.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could\nyou define dirty bulking?\nKYLE GILLETT: [CHUCKLES]\nSo dirty bulking\nis eating an excess of\ncalories not just to acquire\nlean metabolically active\nbody mass or get stronger,\nbut purposely\nacquiring body fat.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\npurposely acquiring muscle\nand fat by overeating\nand lifting weights\ncan stunt one's growth.\nDo I have that correct?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nSo it does two things.\nIf you're doing it as a\nvery young child, it can--\nthat fat can become\nleptin resistant\nand it can produce more\nleptin, and that leptin\ncan activate the\nhypothalamus, which\nactivates the pituitary, which\nreleases gonadotropin, which\nbasically just\nincrease testosterone\nand estrogen earlier than\nit otherwise would have.\nIt's the same mechanism behind\nwhy childhood obesity causes\nearly puberty.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nI do remember a paper\npublished in Science Magazine--\nI believe it was focused\nmainly on females,\nbut showing that when\nenough body fat accumulates,\nthe hormone leptin\nis secreted, and that\ntriggers the onset of puberty.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Given the\nincrease in childhood obesity\nthat we're observing\nnow, are we seeing\nan earlier onset of puberty\nin males and females?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes, in\nboth males and females.\nNot to get too\ntechnical, but there's\na G protein-coupled\nreceptor on the hypothalamus\nand leptin directly\nbinds it, so it\ndoes appear directly\ncause causatory and not\njust correlation.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And if\nI understand correctly,\nwhat you're saying is\nfor a young guy-- let's\nsay, 13, 14-- who\nwants to really bulk up\nand deliberately-- deliberately,\nexcuse me-- overeats, and is\ndoing their squats, and\ndeadlifts, and bench presses\nand really trying to get big,\nthey will get big, but only\nin the lateral dimension.\nThey're effectively\nlimiting their total height\nand it can shut down the long\nbone growth of their limbs.\nIs that correct?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nThe growth of the long\nbones is mostly related\nto the estradiol alpha\nreceptor, so basically,\none of the receptors\nfor estrogen,\nwhich can be secondary\nto early puberty and also\nis related to body fat because\nyou have that conversion\nof testosterone to estrogen.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So can we\nassume that if a young male\nwants to get into resistance\ntraining that bodyweight\nexercises are probably OK\nand maybe even some weight\ntraining, kettlebells,\net cetera,\nbut that they should avoid\ndoing so-called dirty bulking--\ntrying to deliberately\ngain weight--\nup until what age?\nUntil puberty is over?\nKYLE GILLETT: I would say\nan individual should limit\nthe amount of abnormal\nbody fat accumulation,\nor dirty bulking, indefinitely\nthroughout their entire life.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So again,\nif I understand correctly,\nthat recommendation to\navoid deliberate weight gain\nor rapid weight gain is not\njust to allow an individual\nto reach their maximum height,\nbut also to avoid laying down\na lot of body fat cells.\nCorrect?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nThe balance between\nthat is, when\nyou are going\nthrough puberty, you\nare able to add a lot\nof lean body mass--\nnot just muscle mass, but bone\nmass and other mass as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I started\nlifting weights when I was 16,\nand I confess I trained\npretty heavy at times.\nI don't know whether\nor not I would\nhave been taller than\nI am now, but when\nI started that\ntraining, I had already\nreached what was at least\nclose to my predicted height.\nI can't say that I deliberately\nwaited until I had grown.\nIt just so happened that I\nstumbled into the weight room\nand found that I liked it\nat age 16, at which point,\nI was already the\nheight that I am now.\nSo in any case,\nwhat I'm hearing is\nthat laying down a lot of excess\nbody fat is not a good idea.\nWhat if somebody grows up chubby\nor fat for whatever reason--\nreasons related to the eating\npatterns in their family,\nmaybe even some genetic reasons.\nIs it safe and/or wise\nfor a young person--\nso let's say somebody who's\naround the age of puberty,\nor even younger, or in their\nlate teens-- to be dieting\nand actively trying\nto lose body fat.\nIs that safe?\nKYLE GILLETT: Under the\nsupervision of a physician,\nit is certainly safe to\nchange your body composition.\nIn pediatric obesity\nmedicine, you're\noften talking about\na recomposition\nor a renormalization of the\ngrowth curve compared to peers.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nThank you.\nSo as you may have sensed,\nwe started chronologically\nwith puberty, and\nI know that there's\nanother puberty that even\nprecedes the puberty that we're\nall familiar with.\nMaybe-- if you want to\njust briefly mention\nthat because I was talking\nwith you about this\nbefore we started.\nThe puberty that I'm\nmost familiar with,\nand I think most people\nare most familiar with,\nthe acquisition of\ndeepening of the voice,\ngrowth of muscle and bone, body\nhair, acquisition of libido\nand things like that.\nThat's actually the second\npuberty that we all go through.\nMaybe would just mention\nfor us and educate us\non the first puberty.\nI think most people\nwill be hearing\nthis for the very first time.\nKYLE GILLETT: The first\npuberty of everyone's life\nis the first three\nmonths of their life.\nYou may notice that your baby\nhas more acne the first three\nmonths and that they also have,\nin general, just more changes\nrelated to androgens and\nestrogens, perhaps oilier skin,\neven more genitourinary--\ngenital growth during\nthe first three months.\nAnd this is mostly due to DHEA,\nwhich is an adrenal hormone.\nThe second puberty,\nor the puberty\nthat most people know of,\nactually starts that same way\nas well.\nIt's called adrenarche, and\nit's when the adrenals kick in,\nI guess, for the second time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is there\na standard age or age\nrange in which the\ntesticles descend in males?\nKYLE GILLETT:\nUsually before birth.\nIt is not uncommon to have one\nor even two undescended testes,\nbut there is a risk\nof testicular cancer,\nespecially if they are\nnot fixed early and also\nheat damage to the teste.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nthank you for that coverage\nof the two puberties.\nSo early in life.\nI imagine some of our\nlisteners probably\nstill in one or the-- well,\none or the other puberty.\nThe ones that are in\nthe first puberty,\nobviously, aren't\naware that they're\nlistening to this\npodcast, but maybe it'll\nbe embedded in\ntheir subconscious.\nBut some listeners probably\nare still in puberty.\nBut I think everyone can\nremember back to their puberty,\nand roughly when they\nfirst entered puberty,\nand how quickly they\naggregated the secondary sex\ncharacteristics.\nI'd like to turn now to a\ngeneral question about what\nall males ought to do in order\nto optimize their hormones.\nSo if you could just\nlist off the things\nthat all males should do on\na daily basis, weekly basis.\nI mean, should guys\nin their teens and 20s\nbe getting their bloodwork\ndone, should they\nbe taking supplements?\nWe already talked\nabout weight training.\nWhat should they be doing\nand what should they\navoid doing if the\ngoal is to have\na long arc of healthy\nhormone optimization\nthroughout the lifespan?\nKYLE GILLETT: There's many\nthings that you should do.\nAn analogy that I\noften make is when\nthere's a brand new car that\ncomes off the assembly line,\nyou do a full scope\nof diagnostic workup--\nhook it up to the computer.\nAnd I think we should do the\nsame thing with humans as well.\nDuring puberty, obviously,\nyou're a functioning human,\nbut I would say there's\nstill development.\nAnd I think that the\nhuman always develops.\nI don't think\ndevelopment ever ends,\nbut you want to\nmonitor that progress\nacross a person's lifespan.\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh, sorry.\nSo for bloodwork-- I mean,\nwhat would be the earliest--\nlet me put it this way.\nIf blood work didn't cost\nanything and everyone\ncould get it, when\nwould you want\nto see everybody get\ntheir bloodwork done\nfor the first time?\nObviously, individuals\nunder the age of 18\nshould talk with their\nparents about this.\nAnd as long as the\nparents and the child\nagree and the parents are\non board with this as well,\nyou can start getting bloodwork.\nOften, a child will\ncome in with complaints\nof either precocious\npuberty or delayed puberty,\nand this individual might be 9\nor this individual might be 15.\nFor a healthy\nchild, when they're\ngoing through their later\nTanner stages-- which\nis 4 and 5, so they've developed\nseveral secondary sexual\ncharacteristics-- they might\nhave hair growth or starting\nto notice more beard growth.\nThat's a good time to do it.\nIf you're concerned\nwith stature or heighth,\nor if you're not\ntracking along where most\nmembers of your family have--\nnot just their height\nand stature, but also\nthe timing of their puberty,\nthen that's time to get labs.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I\ncould travel back in time,\nI would have gotten my bloodwork\ndone for hormones, and lipids,\nand everything else at 18.\nI, unfortunately, didn't know\nwhere and how to get that,\nand I didn't have any\npressing clinical issues.\nAnd so I think the first time\nthat I got my bloodwork done,\nI was in my late 20s,\nmaybe even in my early 30s.\nAnd I'm still dying to\nknow what my bloodwork was\nwhen, for instance, I was\n17 and I felt a certain way.\nAnd I confess that\nin many dimensions,\nI actually feel better now at--\nI'll be 47 soon-- at 47 than\nI did in my teens and 20s.\nAnd I think it was more\non the psychological side.\nI think that-- but in\nterms of just understanding\nwhy we felt great or why we\nfelt or feel terrible or not so\ngreat, I think bloodwork\nis extremely informative.\nWhat do you think\nare the key things\nto look for in bloodwork?\nI mean, testosterone is\nalways the topic that comes up\nin the context of male\nhormone optimisation,\nbut certainly there are\na lot of other hormones\nthat are important as well.\nKYLE GILLETT: And\nwith testosterone, you\nwant to get either\ntestosterone and an SHBG\nor a free testosterone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Could you\ndefine SHBG for our listeners,\nplease?\nKYLE GILLETT: It is Sex\nHormone Binding Globulin.\nIt is the protein that\nbinds up all androgens\nand estrogen in the body.\nSo the stronger the androgen,\nthe stronger it binds.\nDuring puberty,\nstrong androgens,\nespecially DHT which\nis the strongest\nbioidentical androgen,\nhas a huge role--\na prominent role in secondary\nsexual characteristics.\nAnd if your SHBG is\nvery high, then your DHT\ncan run higher because\nit's not metabolized,\nbut there's not quite\nas much free DHT.\nSo you want to balance\nbetween a high enough free DHT\nand a high enough total DHT.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nobviously, these blood tests\nare going to have to\nbe read and interpreted\nby a qualified physician.\nMost people aren't going to be\nin a position to evaluate them\nproperly, or at least not with\nthe full depth that they could\nif they had an M.D like\nyourself looking at them.\nSo everyone should get\nbloodwork as early as possible\ndepending on their\nbudget and availability.\nWhat should\neverybody do in terms\nof monitoring those markers?\nSo assuming that there's\nno major intervention,\nhow often do you\nrecommend that people\nget their bloodwork done?\nKYLE GILLETT: Let's say--\nlet's take an individual\nwho just turned 18,\nthey just got their\nfirst set of bloodwork.\nThey'll probably\nfind something in it\nthat they may want to optimize\nusing shared decision-making\nwith their physician.\nUsually, a good follow-up\nis about six months.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So twice a\nyear, getting bloodwork done,\nand then having a\nphysician evaluate it.\nThat sounds reasonable to me.\nAnd for those that didn't\ninitiate this at 18,\nsuch as myself, I guess\nthe best time to start then\nwould be as soon as possible.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In\nterms of the other things\nthat all males should do,\nmeaning all males of all ages--\npuberty and beyond-- what\nare some of those things?\nSo on a daily basis,\nmaybe you could just\ntake us through the arc\nof a day and push out\nsome of the protocols\nthat you use\nor the things that you like\nto see your male patients\nuse in order to try and\noptimize their hormone status.\nKYLE GILLETT: I'll briefly\ntouch on some of the lifestyle\npillars to start.\nDiet and exercise\nare the first to.\nIn puberty, sleep is\nparticularly important,\nof course.\nBut with diet and exercise,\nthroughout a lifespan,\nyou want to not exclude\nthings that are helping you.\nFor example, during\npuberty if you're\nconsuming dairy, and then all of\na sudden you cut out all dairy,\ndairy can help increase\nIGF-1 and free IGF-1.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And just,\nagain, for our audience,\nmaybe just mention what\nhaving enough IGF-1 can\ndo for us that's beneficial is?\nKYLE GILLETT: It helps you grow.\nIt helps with\ngenital development,\nsecondary sexual\ncharacteristics, and long bone\ngrowth--\nskin growth, hair\ngrowth, a host of things.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So getting\nan array of nutrients\nthat include dairy.\nWhat other sorts\nof nutrients are\nimportant during development?\nKYLE GILLETT: You want to have\nadequate vitamin D. Vitamin\nD helps with\ntestosterone production,\nit helps, again, with bone\nmineralization and stature.\nAfter an age of about 25--\nand there's not a strict cutoff,\nbut up to about an age of 25,\noptimizing your growth\nhormone and IGF-1\nhelps with bone density\nand bone growth.\nSo from the dietary\nstandpoint, you\nwant to have enough free\nestrogen-- not too much\nwhen you're growing.\nBut you want to help\nbasically stockpile bone\nto prevent a risk of\nosteoporosis or thin bone\nfractures when you're older.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWell, as someone\nwho broke his left foot 5\ntimes while in high school,\nI can say that whatever\nyoung people can\ndo to optimize their bone\ndensity would be great.\nThat problem seems to have\nresolved itself over time,\nbut I don't know.\nBack then, I did a short\nrun as a vegetarian,\nbut I've always\nbeen an omnivore.\nI realize that some\nof this relates\nto ethics, and food allergies,\nand things of that sort.\nBut would you say\nthat, on balance,\nmost people would benefit from\neating a combination of quality\nproteins from animal sources\nand non-animal sources--\nfruits, vegetables,\nand starches?\nI mean, what do you\nthink, for instance,\nabout people following a pure\ncarnivore or a very pure vegan\ndiet in their 20s and 30s?\nKYLE GILLETT: In\ntheir late 20s, it\nmight be a reasonable option.\nIn early 20s and\ncertainly teens,\nit is a horrible idea because\nit is likely to significantly\ndecrease your free androgens.\nSo you will have less\ntestosterone acting\non receptors through the body.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Are there\nany other micronutrients\nor macronutrients that\npeople in their 20s and 30s\nshould emphasize?\nKYLE GILLETT: We haven't really\ntouched on fatty acids or fiber\ntoo much.\nFiber is going to\nbe paramount in kind\nof setting your set\npoint of your gut\nmicrobiome the\nrest of your life.\nThere is prebiotic\nfiber, which you\ncan think of as fish food\nfor your good gut microbiome.\nYour gut microbiome is kind\nof like an aquarium or a fish\ntank.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now,\nI'm just thinking\nabout goldfish swimming around\nin that-- the goldfish eating\npeople.\nDon't eat goldfish, people--\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --live or dead.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah,\nbut any fiber or food\nthat you're putting\nin your gut, it's\neither going to skew your gut\nmicrobiome toward something\nthat is more beneficial\nor more detrimental.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd would you say\nthat the prebiotic fiber and\ngetting essential fatty acids,\nthat would be important to do\nthroughout the lifespan or just\nfor people in their 20s and 30s?\nKYLE GILLETT:\nThroughout the lifespan,\nparticularly important in the\nteenage, '20s, '30s, because it\nhelps with brain development.\nYou're certainly more\nof an expert than me\nwhen it comes to\nbrain development,\nbut it does continue\nto develop, really,\nthroughout the lifespan, but\ncertainly through the 20s\nand 30s as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nabout taking a multivitamin\nwhile you're growing up?\nSo many people do that.\nIs it necessary, is it useful?\nAnd if it's not necessary,\nis it safe to do anyway?\nKYLE GILLETT: It's\ngenerally safe to do anyway.\nI do not think everybody\nneeds a multivitamin.\nThe more exclusionary\nyour diet is--\nfor example, if you\nhave celiac disease\nor if you're planning on\nfertility soon, then perhaps\nit's more reasonable\nto take a multivitamin.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: In a\nprevious discussion of ours,\nI asked you about caloric\nrestriction and testosterone.\nAnd if I recall correctly, the\nidea was that if somebody is\noverweight-- they have an\nexcess fat, adipose tissue--\nthen getting rid of some\nof that adipose tissue\nthrough caloric\nrestriction and exercise,\nprovided it's done not\ntoo fast in a healthy way,\nis going to be beneficial for\ntestosterone in the long-run.\nBut that for\nindividuals who are not\ncarrying an excess of body\nfat, caloric restriction\nis actually going to\nlower testosterone.\nFirst of all, do I\nhave that correct?\nAnd second, are there\nany addendums to that\nyou'd like to give us now?\nKYLE GILLETT: That's correct.\nIf you look at an individual\nin a caloric deficit,\nseveral changes will happen.\nOne is that they'll have less\nbuilding blocks for hormones.\nAnother is that they will\nbe in a catabolic state\nmore often, so that balance\nof anabolism and catabolism\nwill be different.\nThey'll likely have less\nsignaling from growth hormone\nand IGF-1, and they'll\nalso have the high SHBG\nthat we defined earlier\nas the binding protein,\nso their free androgens and\nfree estrogens will go down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nSo we touched on\nsleep being critical.\nI would say throughout\nthe lifespan, trying\nto get enough quality\nsleep at least 80%\nof the nights of your\nlife, and the other 20%\nare just what happens\nwhen there's noise outside\nor you're stressed.\nIt just-- you have\nan exam or you're\nhaving a great time\nfor whatever reason.\nThere are a lot of good\nreasons to lose some sleep\nnow and again as well.\nSo we have sleep,\nwe've got nutrition.\nWe touched on that.\nWe'll get back into\nsupplementation.\nNow, what are some\nof the other pillars\nof creating the proper\nenvironment for hormone\noptimization?\nKYLE GILLETT: Stress is\nprobably the next one.\nDuring both puberty, but\nalso the 20s and 30s,\nindividuals are figuring out how\nthey want to cope with stress\nand also figuring out\nwhat they want to choose\nto put their effort into.\nSo if someone is overstressed,\nthen it can have--\nit can put all the other\nlifestyle pillars--\nand then they stop dieting\nwell, they stop exercising,\nand everything\nelse can go askew.\nThere is also some degree\nof social component to this,\nso perhaps I need to add a\nseventh pillar of social.\nDuring your 20s and 30s, you\nmay be forming a family as well.\nPerhaps you have children, and\nthe health of the family unit\nis going to be vitally\nimportant not only-- not\nnecessarily directly for\nhormone optimisation,\nbut it's going to\nthrow everything\nelse off if it's off.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nfor people that are not\nstarting their own families\nin their 20s and 30s,\ncan that social connection\nbe extended to friendships\nand work relationships as well?\nKYLE GILLETT: Absolutely.\nIn fact, if someone's\nnot starting a family,\nit is just as concerning,\nbut for other reasons.\nEach individual is going to\nhave their close group of family\nand friends.\nAnd if someone does not have\none of those connections,\nthat's when things\ncan potentially\nget bad not just for them\nindividually, but also society.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nwhen you say stress,\nyou mean learn to\nmanage your stress.\nWhat does that look like?\nI mean, if a patient\nhas high blood pressure,\nor even if they don't, you just\nsense that they're stressed.\nThey have a lot of\npressured speech,\nor they're not feeling\nwell, or communicating\nthat they're not doing well.\nWhat are some of\nthe things that you\nrecommend in order to try\nand ameliorate that stress?\nKYLE GILLETT: There's different\nmindfulness or relaxation\ntechniques.\nGoing outside can often\nhelp with this as well.\nDietary changes and exercise\ncan help with this too.\nSome people like\nprayer or meditation.\nAnd a lot of people like\ncounseling or therapy,\nor even just talking openly with\na family member or a friend.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat would it be\nsome of the other pillars\nfor hormone optimization?\nHere, I feel like we're not\njust talking about people\nin their 20s and\n30s, but again, we're\nwrapping our arms around\nbasically puberty onward.\nI mean, gosh, looking\nback, I started\nmeditating pretty early,\nI started weight training\nand running early.\nI gave some thought to\nmy diet in high school,\nbut it really was\nin college that I\nstarted thinking more about\nwhat I was ingesting and why\nand trying to do better there.\nBut people are\ncoming to the table\nat different stages\nof life and trying\nto optimize for hormones.\nSo what would be some\nof the additional things\nthat everybody should do?\nKYLE GILLETT: Everyone should\nget outside and find a movement\npastime to last a lifetime.\nYou're going to get\nsunlight, you're\ngoing to get some degree\nof heat and cold exposure,\nand you're also just\ngoing to move more.\nBeing in an artificial\nenvironment, where there's\nartificial lights\nartificial air conditioning,\nis going to have many\neffects on your body.\nSo that's vital.\nAnother one is finding what\nyour purpose is in life.\nSo I call this spirit,\nbut it's really\njust the self-actualization\ncomponent of Maslow's hierarchy\nof needs, which is basically\nyour physical needs,\nyour mental needs, and then\nyour purpose in life-- what\nyou really like to do.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\npicking some goal or target.\nAnd I always say that\nyou don't have to stick\nto the same goal over time.\nCertainly, I haven't\nalthough I got\nstarted early in the science\ngame and I'm still in it.\nThe idea is not to pick the\nend goal, it is to pick a goal.\nAnd then once you reach that\ngoal to assess, and then\npick another goal, and so on.\nI think sometimes, when people\nhear about picking a purpose,\nthey're like, oh, my\ngoodness, I have to define--\nsort of like naming oneself--\nthat you actually can change\nyour goals and purpose\nover time.\nThis is terrific.\nWould you suggest that\npeople actively use\nor avoid supplementation\nprior to doing\nall these other things?\nI'm somebody that likes to throw\nthe kitchen sink at things,\nbut I also like to do things\npretty systematically.\nSo I would say behavior is\nfirst, then nutrition, then\nsupplementation, and then\nmaybe if, and only if, there's\na real need--\nand of course, working with a\ndoctor-- prescription drugs.\nBut there are probably\npeople in their 20s or 30s--\nmaybe even in their 50s--\nthat aren't feeling\ngreat, and they\nwant to do something in order\nto be able to train more\nor to feel more confident to\nseek out social connection.\nThey just try and go\nabout the whole business\nfrom the other side as well.\nWhat are your thoughts on that?\nKYLE GILLETT: I see\nsupplements and medications\nas very similar--\none is prescribed\nand one is not.\nIn general, medications\nhave more side effects\nor potentially stronger\ntherapeutic with more efficacy.\nBut they are just tools\nto reach an end goal.\nSo depending on the\ngoal, if there's\nan individual that's\nan athlete, then\ncertainly they should\nconsider supplementation.\nOr if someone desires\noptimal or a very high level\nof cognitive performance,\nthey should also\nconsider supplementation.\nAt the same time,\nfood is medicine,\nand a lot of the benefits\nyou can get in supplements,\nyou can get in food as well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nI guess it depends\non how much time and energy\nyou're willing to spend\nand also finances.\nI know that when\nI was in college,\nI could afford just\na few supplements,\nand they were basically whey\nprotein and some fish oil--\nI was fortunate\nthat I was pointed\nin the direction of those\nthings-- and some creatine.\nI couldn't afford much else.\nOver time, of course,\nI could afford more.\nBut it really does often\ndepend on finances.\nBefore we get into some\nspecific recommendations\nto optimize testosterone,\nestrogen, thyroid,\ngrowth hormone, et\ncetera, I want to ask you\na question I've been wondering\nabout for a long time.\nSo often in the discussion\nabout male hormone optimization,\npeople will say, well, if\nyour libido is suffering,\nyou might want to be\nconcerned about testosterone--\nor even estrogen because we know\nthat estrogen can impact libido\nas well.\nSometimes, having estrogen too\nlow is detrimental for libido.\nOr that people will say, you're\nnot recovering from workouts\nor you're just you're\nfeeling kind of depressed.\nThe problem is,\nit's all subjective.\n[CHUCKLES] So how does\none know whether or not\ntheir recovery from workouts,\ntheir energy, their confidence,\ntheir libido is within\na healthy range?\nI mean, obviously, for\npeople in a relationship\nthey can know whether or\nnot their libido matches\nthe sort of cadence of the\nrelationship and their partner.\nBut how should people\nthink about this\nand maybe then start\nto talk about it?\nBecause one of the big\ndifferences, I think,\nbetween males and females\nis that, because females\nhave a monthly cycle, they are\nfamiliar with the changes that\noccur in their hormones over\ntime because every 28 days,\nthose hormones are\nchanging dramatically\nin ways that impact their\nphysiology and psychology.\nBut for males, I\nfeel like there's\na dearth of language to get\ninto the more subtle aspects\nof this.\nIt also has to do with\nprivacy issues and people\nfeeling like they don't\nwant to overshare too much--\nnot knowing what's\nappropriate to share.\nBut when you talk to a\npatient who's in their 30s,\nor maybe even their\n70s or 60s-- it\ndoesn't matter-- a male patient,\nwhat are you listening for?\nAnd I know you're\nnot a psychiatrist,\nbut what are your ears tuned to\nin order to try and figure out\nwhether or not this\nperson could really\nuse some help with\nhormone optimization\nor whether or not\nsomething else--\nor maybe they're\njust doing great\nand they don't realize\nit because they're\nplacing demands on themselves\nthat are excessive?\nKYLE GILLETT: You want to use\na lot of open-ended questions.\nThis process is called\nmotivational interviewing.\nAnd your goal is to\nlisten to the patient\nand not plant an\nidea in their mind\nthat they can follow\nbecause everybody is\ngoing to have a different goal.\nSome people are better at\nreading their biofeedback\nor telling how they\nfeel on a daily basis.\nThere is screening\nquestionnaires designed--\nfor example, an\nADAM questionnaire\nto look at men's men's health\nand hormone-related health.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\ncalled ADAM questionnaire?\nKYLE GILLETT: ADAM\nquestionnaire.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: A-D-A-M?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is\nit available online\nthat people could\nadminister it to themselves.\nAlthough we don't\nwant people making\nclinical diagnoses of\nthemselves or anyone else,\nis it that sort of exam?\nKYLE GILLETT: It is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nKYLE GILLETT: I don't believe it\nis a clinically-validated tool\nlike an ASCVD, which is like a\nrisk of heart attack and stroke\ntool or many other tools.\nThere's one for depression,\nthere's one for anxiety.\nThey're called PHQ9\nand GAD7 respectively.\nBut anyway, there\nis often an in--\nthe ADAM questionnaire-- and\nwhat you hear from the patient,\nif you are a very careful\nlistener, is often different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can\nyou give me an example\nof some of the questions\non this ADAM questionnaire\nor the sorts of motivational\ninterviewing that you might do?\nSo let's say I'm your patient.\nI sit down.\nWhat sorts of\nquestions would you\nask to probe these kinds\nof dimensions of hormones?\nKYLE GILLETT:\nQuestions about libido,\nquestions about\nathletic performance,\nquestions about motivation.\nAnd often, the patient\nwill answer one thing,\nbut what you hear from them\nsubjectively is far different.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nCan you give me an\nexample of a question?\nI'm happy to be the\nguinea pig here.\nKYLE GILLETT: A classic\none is, a guy comes in--\nand a lot of times,\nthey say, oh, no,\nthe wife made me\ngo to the doctor.\nI go once a year, that's it.\nI don't want anything, I\ndon't want any medications.\nTheir screening\nquestionnaires might be zeros\nacross the board, so nothing.\nNo issues.\nThey're apparently\nin perfect health.\nThey talk to you for a\nwhile, they get some rapport,\nthey like you, and then right\nas you're finishing up the visit\nand about to go\nout the room, they\nmention that their\nlibido isn't quite there,\nand they're having a\nlittle bit of ED as well,\nand perhaps they're\neven having some chest\npressure or tightness.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nSo right as you're\nleaving the room,\na patient will tell you that\nthey're having some sexual side\neffects-- or not side effects.\nThey're having some\nsexual challenges,\nand then they'll\nmention chest pressure.\nIs the chest pressure\na general decoy\nfor, it's got to be\nmy heart, or is it\nrelated to the other things\nthat they're reporting?\nKYLE GILLETT: It can be related.\nIn fact, erectile\ndysfunction is known\nas the canary in the coal mine.\nSo coal miners would take the\ncanary down, and it would--\nthe canary would die before\nthe coal miners would\nof, I believe, carbon\nmonoxide poisoning.\nAnd often, one of\nthe causes of ED\nis plaque buildup, which\ncan happen in the coronaries\nas well.\nBut sometimes, they notice\nthe symptom in the genitals\nbefore they do in\nthe coronaries.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nfor such a patient,\nlet's say that patient\nwas a young person where\nplaque buildup in the\narteries and veins\nis not all that likely\nif they're, let's say,\nin their 20s or\n30s, what would be\nyour next step of the interview\nat that point, and what would\nyou consider?\nWould you immediately\norder labs for that person\nto try and rule out any\nkind of actual hormone level\ndeficiency?\nKYLE GILLETT: I certainly\nwould order labs.\nThere are some individuals\nthat are very similar,\nand they come in, and they\nhave the same symptoms,\nand one individual might have\na very, very high testosterone,\nand one individual might\nbe severely hypogonadal.\nSo there's a big difference\nbetween the subjective\nand what the labs look like.\nSo I certainly order labs.\nYou also ask them about if\nit's situational or not,\nyou ask them if they\nhave ED if they're--\nyou ask them about their habits.\nYou even ask about\nporn, and masturbation,\nand all these issues.\nAnd of course, that's between\nthe doctor and the patient.\nAnd depending on\nwhat they tell you,\nyou can often determine if there\nis a situational component--\nsome people call\nit psychogenic ED,\nbut I don't love the\nterm psychogenic ED,\nbecause it kind of puts some\nblame on the patient's mind.\nBut a lot of the time,\nthat is the case.\nThere is even a test.\nAnd this is very rarely\nordered, but it's called\na nocturnal penile tumescence.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now,\nis it true that there\nare periodic erections\nduring sleep-- correct?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nSo you basically\nput a cuff to see\nif you were having a normal\nsized erection during sleep.\nAnd I believe about 90% of\nthe time they do that test,\nthey are indeed\nhaving erections.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhich would point\nto this psychogenic\norigin of whatever\nchallenges they're having in\nterms of sexual interactions.\nYou mentioned porn\nand masturbation.\nThis topic has come up a\nbunch of times on this podcast\nand on other\npodcasts I've gone on\nbecause of the relationship\nbetween dopamine sexual\nmotivation and sexual behavior.\nAnd I've been of the\npretty strong stance\nthat, while I'm not judging\nporn or masturbation,\nit can create a brain\nwiring situation where\nmales in particular\nessentially teach their brain\nto be aroused by watching other\npeople have sex as opposed\nto being the first person\nactor in sexual interactions.\nSo in that sense, that's\nmore about the brain wiring,\nand neuroplasticity,\nand dopamine.\nBut what are your thoughts\non porn and masturbation\nas they relate to hormones?\nI mean, this is a big\ndebate on the internet.\nIn fact, one of the\nmost common debates\nis whether or not masturbation\nincreases or decreases\ntestosterone in males.\nCertainly, it will\ndecrease motivation\nto go find sexual partners.\nWe know this.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And there\nare more and more data on this\nall the time.\nIn terms of the effects of\npornography and masturbation--\nand here, I suppose we need\nto be somewhat specific\nand operationally define\nwhat we're talking about.\nWe're talking about\nporn and masturbation\nto the point of ejaculation,\nbecause my understanding\nis that the ejaculation\nand orgasm associated with\ncauses an increase in\nprolactin, which blunts\nlibido for some period of time.\nThe duration of that will\nvary from person to person\nand circumstance\nto circumstance.\nBut basically, all of\nthis points to the fact\nthat porn and\nmasturbation can really\nlimit libido in the real world.\nAnd to me, pornography and the\nscreen is not the real world.\nAlthough screens exist\nin the real world,\nthe real world doesn't\nexist in the screen.\nKYLE GILLETT: That's\nan accurate statement,\nand prolactin does have a\nsignificant acute increase\nafter ejaculation.\nIt does to some degree\nafter orgasm as well,\nbut prolactin acts\non the pituitary\nto inhibit the release of\nthe hormones LH and FSH,\nof which LH can\nincrease testosterone.\nSo this may be one\nof the cases where\nthe dose makes the poison.\nAnd if it is a very\nfrequent habit,\ncertainly daily or\nmore than once a day\nwould be very detrimental from\na hormonal component not even\ntaking into account\nthe neural wiring.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Listen,\nI think it's terrific\nthat you've actually\ndefined frequency,\nbecause this is the problem\non the internet or even\nin the doctor's office.\nYou'll see descriptions\nabout pornography\nbeing dangerous\nfor certain things\nor detrimental to hormones.\nPeople say frequent,\nbut what's frequent?\nSo you're saying daily\nor multiple times per day\nwould be potentially\ndetrimental to the hormone\nprofile of a male of\nessentially any age.\nKYLE GILLETT: And that's\njust for masturbation.\nWith pornography--\nwith porn use as well,\nit would likely be worse.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAnd why is that?\nJust the sort of\ndopaminergic drive\nof the stimulus-- just the\nreally intense visual stimulus?\nKYLE GILLETT:\nDopamine sensitivity.\nI think that using the analogy\nof a dopamine wave pool,\nit would deepen the\npool, but not increase\nyour supply of dopamine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Maybe you could\ndescribe the dopamine wave pool\nbecause I think it's such\na powerful way of thinking\nabout dopamine and\nwhat dopamine does.\nIn fact, I've always credited\nyou when I've done it,\nbut I've generally stolen your\nanalogy of the dopamine wave\npool because it's so astute.\nKYLE GILLETT: The\ndopamine wave pool\ndescribes the natural\nvariation of ups and downs\nin your dopamine\nor your motivation.\nAnd in the wave pool, depending\non how high the peak is,\nyou often have a deeper trough.\nSo you do not want\nto high of a peak.\nIn addition, if your\npeak is very, very high--\nfor example, when you're using\nmany substances like cocaine\nor like amphetamines,\nyour dopamine\ncan go so high that\nyou lose almost all\nthe water from the\nwave pool, and then\nwhen you crash from that,\nnot only is the trough low,\nyou have less dopamine in\nthe pool to begin with.\nThe dopamine\nreceptor is extremely\nsensitive, as is the\nGaba receptor, which\nis an inhibitory receptor,\nwhereas dopamine is technically\na stimulant more related to\nadrenaline and noradrenaline.\nThe depth of the pool\ncan change very quick.\nSo you want to have that\nhappy medium where you're\nfairly near the top, but\nyou're not so near the top\nthat the depth of the\npool is going to go down.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if I\ninterpret that in the context\nof this discussion about libido,\nsex, porn, and masturbation,\nif somebody has a very intense\nsexual experience-- and here,\nwe're not necessarily talking\nabout an intense orgasm--\nwe're talking about just a lot\nof intense visual, so very--\na lot of intense imagery,\nor auditory input, or both--\nthat is going to\nlead to a situation\nwhere dopamine is going\nto be depleted afterwards.\nA guest on this podcast before--\nmy colleague at Stanford, Dr.\nAnna Lembke, who's an\nexpert in addiction,\ntalked a bit about this--\nthe sort of seesawing.\nLike, here, we're talking\nabout a wave and a crashing\nout of the water\nfrom the wave pool.\nThere, it was a seesawing\nfrom pleasure and pain.\nThere's going to be a longer\nand deeper period of lack\nof pleasure following that.\nAnd I think a lot of people\nthink, oh, well, that's great.\nThey want the\nintense experience.\nBut if that intense experience\nis coming from pornography\nand masturbation-- or I suppose\ncoming from high adrenaline\nactivities, like life-risking\nparkour hanging off the side\nof a building-- it inevitably\nis going to lead to depressive\nepisodes, low libido\nepisodes that follow.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct-- in\na similar physiologic way\nto withdrawal from\nstimulants, like amphetamines.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Now, is sex\nwith a partner different?\nBecause there are\nmany people who\nare chasing more\nand more intense\nexperiences with a partner as\nopposed to through pornography\nand masturbation.\nAgain, here, we're\ntalking about all ages.\nAnd I should always say,\nanytime we're talking about sex\nwith a partner, we're talking--\nthe four conditions that I\nalways lay out on the Huberman\nLab podcast are that we're\ntalking about consensual,\nage appropriate, context\nappropriate, species\nappropriate interactions.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah,\nand this is also\na case where the dose\nmakes the poison.\nSo if there's-- obviously,\nmeeting all those criteria,\nif they have one preference\nthat, for both of them,\nis a positive experience,\nthen that is likely OK.\nYou're not going to be\nable to maintain dopamine\nover a certain threshold\nfor a long period of time,\nso there very well\nmay be a crash\nfrom that experience as well.\nAnd that crash may be different\nin one partner than the other.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nSo I'll draw an analogy to food.\nIt would be like you don't have\nto serve the banquet meal seven\nnights of the week,\nmaybe just two.\nIs that right?\nAnd there are other\ndelicious foods out there?\nCan--\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --we\nuse that analogy?\nKYLE GILLETT: --that\nis very reasonable.\nI'm not trying to be PG-13.\nI'm just trying to parsimony\nOccam's razor the ability\nto describe a lot of\nthings in a few words.\nI'd like to return to the key\nthings that people should do--\nor I should say, the key\nthings that men should\ndo to optimize their hormones.\nSo we talked about\ngetting some movement,\ngetting some sunlight, getting\nquality social connection one\nway or the other, avoid\nexcessively frequent\nmasturbation and\nviewing pornography.\nAnd for some people, zero\nmight be the optimal number.\nAnd I keep coming back to this--\nKYLE GILLETT: For most people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--for most people.\nInteresting.\nI feel so fortunate\nto have grown\nup prior to the availability\nof internet pornography.\nI've never been a big\nconsumer of pornography.\nIt's just not been\nmy thing, but I\nhear so often from males of\nall ages about their addiction\nto it, their affliction by it.\nIt's really a serious\nissue, and that's\none of the reasons why\nI'm grateful that you're\nwilling to talk about this\nand your clinical experience\nwith these patients.\nI'd like to take a quick\nbreak and acknowledge\none of our sponsors,\nAthletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens,\nnow called AG1, is\na vitamin-mineral-probiotic\ndrink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreen since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets\nme the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by\ngut microbiota that\ncommunicate with the brain, the\nimmune system, and basically\nall the biological\nsystems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics\nin Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens,\nvitamins, and minerals\nthat make sure that all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs\nare met and it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to\ntry Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you five\nfree travel packs that make it\nreally easy to mix up\nAthletic Greens while\nyou're on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3, K2.\nAgain, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof vitamin D3, K2.\nIn terms of exercise,\nhere's-- again,\nit's a double-edged sword.\nOn the one hand, it's\ngreat to get exercise,\nbut I'm familiar with--\nif I train an hour a day--\n10 minutes of\nwarm-up in 50 minutes\nto an hour of weight\ntraining or 50 minutes\nto an hour of\ncardio, I feel great,\nespecially if, once a week,\nI take a complete day off.\nThat's sort of my\ngeneral schedule.\nI'm also familiar\nwith when I go out\nfor runs that are excessively\nlong-- two hour runs or I spend\n90 minutes in the\ngym to frequently,\nI start to feel like garbage.\nEverything suffers.\nMy sleep starts to suffer.\nIt doesn't matter\nhow much I eat--\nI don't seem to recover.\nI don't feel well.\nSo I realize that\nrecovery ability varies\nbetween individuals,\nbut what do you\nthink is a healthy, sustainable\nexercise regimen that anyone\ncan follow that will also\nsupport their hormone status?\nKYLE GILLETT: For really\nvigorous exercise,\naround three to\nfour times a week\nis very sustainable over\na long period of time.\nOn top of that, you could add\nin 3 or four more instances\nof less vigorous exercise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\nfor less vigorous,\nwould you mean zone two\ncardio where you can hold\na conversation, but\nbeyond which you can't?\nAnd for more vigorous\nyou're thinking\nweight training or high\nintensity interval type\ntraining?\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nYou can also weight train\nand have some benefit even\nat a low to moderate intensity.\nIf you think about\nweight training\nwhere you have-- and it's\nnot necessarily related\nto the incidence of DOMS,\nwhich is Delayed Onset Muscle\nsoreness.\nBut if you weight\ntrain lazy or easy\nfrom time to time--\nobviously, you\nwant to weight train\nvery heavy from time\nto time as well because of\nmore lean body mass growth.\nBut if you weight\ntrain lighter, you're\ngoing to be able to\ndo it more often,\nand it can still help with\nthe hypertrophy of collagen--\nfor example, in\ntendons and ligaments.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo here, again, I'd\nlike to perhaps drill into\nthis notion of intensity\nand light weights because\nfor me, some of the most\nbrutal workouts\nI've ever done were\nin what I would consider\na high repetition range--\n15 to 50.\nActually, I went up to Oregon\nto watch the International Track\nand Field Championships.\nWe went by to Cameron\nHaynes's place--\nthe Cameron Haynes--\nand he and his trainer\nput us through a\nworkout that was\n25 to 50 repetitions per set,\nand it was done in circuit,\nand it was brutal.\nSo it was light--\nI mean, those\nweights were nothing.\nIn some cases, it\nwas body weight.\nBut the number of\nrepetitions was brutal.\nSo when you say\nlimiting intensity,\nare you talking about limiting\nthe number of sets to failure,\nare you talking\nabout really being\nkind of a lazy bear in the gym?\nI like to do that every\nonce-- so a long rest,\nthat sort of thing.\nWhat are your thoughts\non that as it relates\nto hormone optimization?\nSo I'll just mention-- and\nthen I'll let you answer--\nI feel best overall when I'm\ntraining for 10 minute warm-ups\nand about 45 or 50 minutes\nof weight training,\nwhere I'm pretty\nlazy between sets.\nTwo to three minute\nrests, training somewhere\nin the 6 to 10 rep range,\ngoing to failure every once\nin a while, but mostly\ngetting that sort\nof last rep before what\nI would think is failure.\nNo forced reps,\nthat kind of thing.\nAnd then jogging on the\nother days, nice and easy.\nWhen I do that, I feel fantastic\nin all other dimensions\nof life.\nWhen I train more\nintensely than that,\neven with lightweight, so\nfaster cadence and lower rest,\nI feel like garbage.\nI get a headache, I'm kind of\nornery, everything suffers.\nSo what are your thoughts on\ndefining a optimal exercise\nstrategy for hormones.\nI've never measured my\nhormones in those two\ndifferent contexts,\nbut I have to imagine\nthat it's cortisol related.\nKYLE GILLETT: When they\nstudy the effect of exercise,\nspecifically vigorous exercise,\none area that's been studied\nis vigorous exercise-- episodes\nlasting longer than an hour.\nAnd they usually track it by a\nrating of perceived exertion,\nwhich isn't perfect, and it's\nnot extremely actionable,\nbut it's helpful for\nclinical science.\nBut the takeaway from that\nis, basically, do not--\nit is not hormonally helpful\nto train, especially regularly\ntrain, vigorously for\nlonger than an hour.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So I'm happy\nto hear that because it sounds\nlike for most people,\nthat hour of work\nis really the threshold.\nI think this is important\nfor people to hear,\nespecially males\nbecause I think with all\nof the incredible examples\nout there of people like Cam,\nlike David Goggins,\npeople who are training\nfor very long periods of time--\nand leaving aside all issues of\nwhat people are doing in order\nto optimize the recovery, I\nthink an hour a day of exercise\nis just a great program\nthat most anyone can follow.\nAnd beyond an hour, you start\nrunning into challenges.\nAnd the occasional 90-minute\nor two hour workout\nis no big deal.\nBut if you start doing that\nmore than once every two months,\nI think you're\nheaded for trouble.\nHave you seen that in\npeople's blood work\nand in their hormones?\nDo you ever see\npeople that are just\nbadly overtrained because\nthey're just training\ntoo hard and too often?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nWhen the blood work\nis particularly bad,\nthey're often in a large\ncaloric deficit as well.\nThere's a synergistic effect\nbetween a caloric deficit.\nEven if you're maintaining\nadequate protein intake,\nyou might not be maintaining\nadequate iron intake\nor adequate vitamin D. And\nyou're also just literally\nin a caloric deficit.\nPerhaps low carbs as well,\nvery low free testosterone.\nAnd they're simultaneously doing\na lot of vigorous exercise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nI often hear, and I'm starting\nto wonder whether or not,\nsome of the quicker-to-results\nnutrition tactics--\nthings like dropping\nall carbohydrates,\nor the quicker-to-results\nexercise habits,\nlike starting to do six\nday a week really intense\nworkouts-- whether or\nnot, in the short run,\nthey work because they cause\nthe cosmetic changes that people\nare seeking, but that\nthey really undermine\nthe overall goal, which\nis, at least to me,\nto have your hormones Maybe.\nnot optimized to 100%,\nbut to always be aiming\nfor 100% and be close to it\nat every stage of life.\nKYLE GILLETT:\nConsistency is key here.\nIf you are not\nconsistent, then the law\nof diminishing returns\ncertainly applies.\nSo 80% or 90% of the benefit\nover many, many months\nis far better than 100%,\nbut only half the time.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah.\nOne thing that I found\nto be tremendously useful\nis to finish the workout while\nI still have energy, to not take\nmyself to exhaustion.\nAnd then I'm able to talk\nabout the dopamine wave pool.\nI'm able to sort of\nride that into the rest\nof the day feeling great.\nI sort of save or bank some\nof the vigor from the training\nto bring it into my work.\nBut then again,\nI'm not an athlete.\nI get paid to think and to\nspeak, not to lift weights\nor to run.\nKYLE GILLETT: Another\ncomponent of that\nis the balance between\nyour sympathetic,\nwhich is your fight or\nflight nervous system,\nand your parasympathetic,\nwhich is your rest or digest\nnervous system.\nThere is an anecdote,\nwhich is likely true,\nthat many elite\nbodybuilders are very\nparasympathetic besides while\nthey're lifting weights.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You\nmean they're lazy\nand they like to eat a lot.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: The lazy bear\nin the gym kind of phenomenon.\nKYLE GILLETT: Absolutely.\nBut that being said, after a\nvery, very vigorous workout--\nfor example, one where\nyou're trained to failure,\nwhich bodybuilders and power\nlifters do all the time--\nyou feel the tiredness--\nor you feel the strain\nfrom that heavy\nsympathetic activity\nwhen you are lifting\na heavy weight,\nand it can\npotentially affect how\nyou feel the rest of the day.\nSo many people who have a job\nwhere that is highly cognitive\ndo not like to have an\nextremely vigorous workout\nin the morning, which\nis when a lot of people\nare able to exercise.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: When I exercise\nearly in the morning-- that is,\nbefore 9:00 AM--\nI have more energy all day long.\nIf I do it mid-morning,\nI have experienced\nmore of an afternoon crash.\nThere's probably some\ncircadian biology in there.\nI also noticed-- and I've\nactually seen in my bloodwork--\nthat if I don't get\nout for a 45-minute jog\nat least once a week,\nall of my blood profiles\nsuffer in a direction that\nI don't want them to go.\nIn particular, testosterone\nand estrogen move in directions\nthat are not\nconducive to my goals.\nI'd like to talk about\nsome of the approaches\nthat people can use in\norder to optimize hormones.\nAnd these days, for\nbetter or for worse--\nI think for worse--\nyounger guys are\nasking about and using\ntestosterone replacement\ntherapy-- so-called TRT.\nAnd I just want to\nframe this up by saying\nthere is no strict\ncutoff for what is TRT.\nThere are plenty of people whose\nblood levels of testosterone\nand estrogen are within\nthe normal reference range\nand decide to start\ndoing these things.\nOf course, they can\nlimit fertility.\nThere are a bunch of\nissues even at non, quote,\nunquote, steroidal\nperformance enhancing dosages.\nI'd love to frame this up\nby first defining our terms,\nbecause one of the\nchallenges on the internet\nis people talk about\nTRT, then they'll\ntalk about performance\nenhancing drugs,\nthey'll talk about steroids.\nThey're all steroids.\nI mean, testosterone, estrogen\nare both steroid hormones.\nBut what one considers\nreplacement therapy\nversus what one considers\nperformance enhancing\nis going to depend.\nSo here's my question.\nWhy in the world--\n[EMPHASIS] why in the world--\nwould any male in his teens\nor twenties, or even 30s,\nwhose blood levels of\ntestosterone and estrogen\nare at the appropriate\nlevels, meaning\nwithin the normal\nreference range,\ntake exogenous testosterone\ngiven all the negative effects\non fertility, some of\nthe challenges that it\ncan present if the dosages\naren't quite right, et cetera.\nWhy would they do\nthat, certainly\nif they are not being paid\nfor a particular endeavor,\nlike they're not making money?\nIf they are playing\na sport, chances\nare they're not allowed\nto do that anyway.\nIt's on the banned\nsubstances list.\nSo to me, it just seems\nlike a crazy idea.\nBut then again,\nI'm of a generation\nthat really hasn't thought about\ndoing that stuff until people\nwere in their 40s and\n50s or even never.\nSo is there ever a case for\nsomebody in their 20s or 30s\nto take testosterone if\ntheir blood levels are\nwithin the 300 to 900 nanograms\nper deciliter reference range?\nKYLE GILLETT: Not many cases.\nThe reason for any performance\nenhancing drug, whether or not\nit is a steroid, synthetic,\nbioidentical, or otherwise,\nvaries a lot.\nSome individuals do it\nonly for cosmetic reasons\neven if it can have\ndeleterious effects\non the cosmetic\nappearance, for example,\nof your skin in the long run.\nBut everyone has their\ndifferent reasons.\nAs far as like when\ndoes the benefit\noutweigh the detriment, not\nvery often if you're in your 20s\nand certainly--\nprobably-- almost hardly never.\nThere's always rare cases, like\nColeman syndrome and whatnot,\nbut almost never if\nyou're very young.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So for people\nin their 20s, 30s, and beyond--\n40s, et cetera-- whose\ntestosterone and estrogen\nlevels are at the\nappropriate ratios,\nand then within the\nnormal reference range,\nand they feel pretty good--\n[CHUCKLES] we talked about\nthe ADAMs exam-- or this sort\nof like feel-pretty-good is code\nfor libido, energy, recovery,\net cetera, and are\nfeeling at least\nworkable for their lifestyle.\nFor those people,\nwhat can they do\nbesides get great sleep, train,\nbut not too hard or too often,\net cetera, et cetera?\nWhat are some of the things in\nthe realm of supplementation\nthat can help them optimize\ntheir testosterone and estrogen\nwithout suppressing their\nown endogenous production\nof testosterone and estrogen?\nKYLE GILLETT: Let's mention\ncreatine is the first one.\nCreatine is\ninteresting because it\nhas multiple different effects.\nIt helps with amino\nacid synthesis.\nIt also helps with\noxidative stress.\nIt can also serve\nas the backup fuel\ntank for your mitochondria,\nso holding backup ATP.\nAnd it does slightly\nincrease total testosterone,\nand it also increases the\nconversion of testosterone\nto dihydrotestosterone,\nso potentially it's\nespecially useful in men\nin even their teenage years\nand their 20s.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: You mentioned\nthe conversion of testosterone\nto dihydrotestosterone, and\nthere is mythology out there\nthat creatine can\nincrease hair loss,\nI'm guessing because there's\nat least one study showing\nthat creatine can increase DHT--\ndihydrotestosterone.\nAnd DHT is one of the\nprimary hormones that can\npromote male pattern baldness.\nSo the question therefore is,\ndoes creatine supplementation\nincrease the rate of hair loss?\nKYLE GILLETT: Theoretically,\nit can, but in each individual,\npreventing hair loss\nis a very poor reason\nto take creatine,\nbecause it's not\ngoing to take you to a\nsupraphysiologic level,\nit's not going to\nincrease your androgens\nto a unnormal level of binding.\nSo I feel like this--\nif that was a reason to not\ntake creatine for hair loss,\nthen that's--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYou mean-- sorry--\nhair loss is not a reason\nto avoid taking creatine?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nHair loss is not a reason\nto avoid taking creatine.\nThink of it as just\nbringing you to what you\nare naturally inclined to have.\nIf your conversion of\ntestosterone to DHT\nis already high, then often,\ncreatine does not affect this.\nIt just kind of\nresets your balance\nbetween testosterone being\naromatized to estrogen\nor being 5-alpha reduced DHT.\nSo it's not going to speed\nup hair loss more than just\nnaturally being a male does.\nSo in some individuals,\nit will have no effect.\nIn some individuals--\nfor whatever reason,\nthey have almost no 5-alpha\nreductase activity--\nit will return them\nto natural or normal.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nWell, I take 5 grams a day\nof creatine monohydrate.\nI do it for the\ntissue volumizing\neffects, so for\nexercise benefits,\nbut also for the\ncognitive effects.\nI don't know if it's\nincreasing my hair loss.\nI mean, I've got a little bit\nof widow's peak type hair loss.\nThat's where it is for me.\nI suppose beard growth is\nassociated with DHT too.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhat I learned--\nbut then again I haven't\nbeen into those literature\nin a long time-- is that because\nof differences in receptors,\nthat DHT causes hair\ngrowth on the face and hair\nloss on the head.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes,\nand the amount,\nand the sensitivity, and\ndensity of those receptors\nis genetically determined.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And is it true\nthat if your mother's father\nwas bald that you will be\nbald in the same pattern,\nand if he wasn't, you won't?\nKYLE GILLETT: That is\na decent correlation.\nPart of the proposed\nmechanism of this-- well,\nthere are several genes,\nand you can actually\ntest your genes for hair loss.\nYou do get a decent amount\nof them from your mother.\nThe unique thing you\nget from your mother\nthat she may have\ngotten from her father--\nthat she got one of the\ncopies from her father--\nis your X chromosome.\nAnd the androgen receptor\ngene is on your X chromosome,\nso all men got their\nandrogen receptor\ngene from their mother.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's\non their X chromosome,\nnot on the Y chromosome.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nEven though all of\nthe, quote, unquote,\nmale promoting genes are on\nthe Y chromosome, like malaria,\nand inhibiting, et cetera.\nInteresting.\nSo 5 grams a day of creatine\nfor most people should be fine.\nBeneficial for tissue\nvolumizing-- so strength,\nbringing water\ninto the muscles--\nand for the cognitive effects.\nAnd the clinical support\nfor creatine, I think,\nis quite strong at the\n5 gram per day dosage.\nWhat other sorts of supplements\ncan people benefit from?\nWe already talked\nabout the omegas\nand making sure that people are\ngetting enough prebiotic fiber\nto support the gut\nmicrobiome and vitamin D.\nSo what other supplement-based\ntools can people consider?\nKYLE GILLETT: Another one\nwe can loop in with creatine\nis betaine.\nSome people are\nnonresponders to creatine,\nso you can increase\nthat to 10 grams,\nor you can use\nits cousin betaine\nto help with amino\nacid synthesis\nand shunting of energy.\nAlong with that, I would put\nl-carnitine which is actually\nthe smallest peptide hormone.\nIt's just two amino acids that\nare put together, so it's a--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: It's a hormone?\nInteresting.\nI'm not challenging it.\nKYLE GILLETT: Well, peptide.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm just--\nI'm not challenging it.\nKYLE GILLETT: I would call it\na peptide more than a hormone.\nSo I would not call\nl-carnitine a hormone,\nbut I would call\ndopamine a hormone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I\ncould-- a neurohormone.\nIt's so hard to define things\nas transmitters or hormones\nat some level.\nI agree.\nSo l-carnitine-- actually,\nI should backtrack.\nBetaine-- do you recall\nwhat dosage people typically\nwould take if they're a\ncreatine non-responder?\nKYLE GILLETT: 1 to 3 grams.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Per day?\nKYLE GILLETT: In fact--\nyeah-- several\nversions of creatine\nhave betaine mixed in because\nit helps with the processing\nof methionine and homocysteine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So if somebody\nis already taking creatine\nand likes it and\nresponds to it--\nI'll raise my hand--\nsuch as myself,\nwould adding betaine help or\nis it redundant with creatine?\nKYLE GILLETT: Only\nif their homocysteine\nis persistently elevated.\nAnd homocysteine is kind of\nlike an inflammatory marker that\ncan build up if you're not\nconverting enough of it\ndown stream.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHow would I know?\nKYLE GILLETT: Just a\nblood test or if you\nknew your MTHFR\npolymorphism, which\nis basically how you\nadd methyl groups\nto many things in the body.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nAny side effects of betaine\nthat people should be aware of?\nKYLE GILLETT: Not\nthat I know of.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: People can\nlook it up on-- examine.com\nis a great site for that.\nThey'll surely list it.\nThey just revamped\ntheir site by the way,\nand it was awesome before,\nand it's platinum now.\nSo l-carnitine-- what are\nthe ways to take l-carnitine?\nI know that there is\noral forms in capsules\nand there's injectables.\nThe injectables, I think\nyou need a prescription.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nYou need a prescription\nfor the injectables,\nor you should really\nget a prescription\nfor the injectables.\nFor when you inject it--\nof course, at the\nsupervision of your doctor--\nit's usually done\nintramuscularly.\nIt's an aqueous\nsolution, so it does not\nhave an oil or a\ncarrier oil in it\nlike TR-- like\ntestosterone esters do.\nHowever, if you inject\nit too superficially,\nit's not going to make\nor break anything.\nOften, it just burns if you\ninject it subcutaneously\nand it does not disseminate\nthroughout the body as well.\nL-carnitine potentially\nhas localized effects\nif you inject it.\nIf you ingest it orally,\nthen it has a very low\nbioavailability--\nmaybe only 10%.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well,\nI think most people are\ngoing to be able to\nget l-carnitine only--\nor in its capsule form.\nSo what are the\ndosages of l-carnitine\nthat one needs to\ningest then if they\nwant to get a benefit because\nif only 10% is being absorbed,\nit's probably a\nlot of l-carnitine.\nHow much should\npeople take per day?\nKYLE GILLETT:\nUsually, I recommend\nfor oral l-carnitine\nbetween 1,000 milligrams\nand up to 4,000 or\n5,000 milligrams.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So 1 to\n4-- maybe even 5 grams.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nUp to 5 grams a day.\nIf you're on that\nmuch, especially\nif you have a dysregulated\ngut microbiome,\nyou should be\nconcerned with TMAO\nwhich is a potential\ncarcinogen that both carnitine\nand choline can convert into.\nAnd your gut\nmicrobiota determine\nhow much that happens.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nIs it true that I\ncan offset any negative\neffects of alpha GPC--\ncholine that is-- and\nl-carnitine that I\ntake by ingesting garlic?\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: There's a compound\nin garlic called allicin--\nI believe it's\nA-L-L-I-C-I-N. It's also part\nof the scientific name-- the\ngenus of types of garlic.\nAnd this can help decrease\nthe conversion to TMAO.\nBerberine actually slightly\ndecreases the conversion\nto TMAO as well probably\nthrough alteration\nof the gut microbiome.\nAnd then just optimizing\nyour gut microbiome\ncan decrease conversion.\nSo not everyone needs\nallicin, but it's something\nthat you should\ncertainly consider\nif you were on a high dose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm\ngoing to continue\nto take the 600 milligrams\nof garlic every time\nI take my l-carnitine,\nbut I'm going\nto skip the berberine\nbecause berberine gives me\nbrutal headaches and it makes me\ncrave carbohydrates because it\ndrops my blood sugar.\nKYLE GILLETT: It has many other\neffects, including the dawn\nphenomenon where\nit drops your blood\nsugar when you're sleeping\nand you can't even realize it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I am\nnot a fan of berberine,\nand I'm sorry for\nthose of you that are.\nI'm not trying to offend\nanyone, although frankly,\nif you're being offended\nby my stance on berberine,\nthen maybe we should\nhave another discussion.\nIn any case injectable\nl-carnitine,\nif one can get that through a\ndoctor, how much is absorbed\nand how much should one take?\nKYLE GILLETT: Almost\nall of it's absorbed.\nIn general you're taking\nbetween 500 milligrams up to--\nyou can take a pretty high\ndose up to 2,000 milligrams.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what\nwe did not talk about\nis what l-carnitine does?\nSo why should why should\nsomeone go through all of this?\nIs it to optimize\ntestosterone, is it\nworking on the receptor side?\nWhat's l-carnitine doing?\nKYLE GILLETT: It's a shuttle.\nSo I think it's named\ncarnitine palmitoyl coenzyme\nA. Basically, it\njust takes nutrients\nfrom outside your\nmitochondria and puts them in.\nIt also has a unique effect--\nwell, not too unique\nbecause tadalafil actually\nhas this effect as well--\nis that it increases the\ndensity of the androgen receptor\nand the cytoplasm of your cells.\nSo even if your androgen\nreceptor sensitivity\ndoesn't change and even if your\ntestosterone does not change,\nyou will have more testosterone\nbinding to that increased\nnumber of receptors.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Does\none need to cycle\nl-carnitine, creatine, betaine?\nKYLE GILLETT: No reason\nto cycle any of those.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nother supplements\ncan one use to try and\nimprove hormone profiles?\nAnd here, I realize we're\nusing a very broad brush\nbecause when we say\nimprove hormone profiles,\nwhat are we really\ntalking about?\nAnd for me, at least, I think\nabout the subjective stuff.\nDo people feel\nlike they are going\nto have more energy as\na consequence of doing\nthese things, are they going to\nhave the more optimized libido,\nor are they going to have\nmore optimized recovery\nfrom exercise?\nBecause, I mean,\nit's not clear to me\nthat taking one's\ntestosterone from 600 to 800\nis always going to be a good\nthing, especially if estrogen\nis increasing in parallel.\nThat could cause issues.\nIt could certainly\nmake things better.\nIt could certainly\nmake things worse.\nSo with that backdrop, what\nare some of the other things\npeople can take?\nAnd then we'll go\nback to this issue\nof what really is optimization.\nKYLE GILLETT: Let's\nbriefly mention vitamin D,\nwhich is also a hormone.\nIt's actually a sterile hormone.\nAnd if you have deficient\nvitamin D and you replace it,\nthen you will optimize\nyour testosterone.\nLet's also mention boron.\nSo if you have a\nvery high SHBG, boron\ncan acutely help lower\nit usually in a dose\nof 5 to 12 milligrams per day.\nIt's not really a\nsustained effect,\nbut boron is depleted in\nsoils in many countries.\nI believe it's very high in\nsoils in Greece and Turkey.\nSo eating dates or raisins\nthat are from those areas\npotentially have more boron.\nBoron also might be\none of the reasons\nwhy the reference\nrange for testosterone\nis much higher in those\ncountries than other countries.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\njust to remind people,\nthat SHBG sex hormone\nbinding globulin\nis attaching to the\ntestosterone molecule\nand limiting the amount of\nso-called free testosterone\nthat's available to have\nits impact on cells.\nWhen Dr. Peter Attia\nwas on this podcast--\nin fact, sitting in\nthat very chair--\nhe said that the ideal level\nof free testosterone in males\nshould be about 2% of\none's total testosterone.\nWould you agree with\nthat number or disagree?\nI'm sure Peter would be\nfine if you said either.\n[CHUCKLES]\nKYLE GILLETT: 2% is\na good rule of thumb.\nUsually, the reference range\nis between about 1% and 4%.\nSome people do have\ngenetic polymorphisms\nin SHBG, a specific\ngene mutation where\nthey have very low SHBGs.\nAlso men that have varicose\nveins in their testes,\nalso known as varicoceles,\ntend to have very high SHBGs,\nso that percentage would\nlikely be less than 2%.\nSo just because your\npercentage of free T to total T\nis a little bit above\nor below 2%, that's OK.\nWe just need to figure\nout the reason why it is.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nHow would somebody\nknow if they have varicose\nveins in their testicles,\nespecially if their\ntesticles are still in--\nattached to their body?\nKYLE GILLETT: Sometimes,\nit's hard to tell.\nThere are several grades.\nIf you have a grade 3\nor a grade 4 varicocele,\nit has what's called a\nbag of worms appearance.\nSo think about if you've\njust resistance trained,\nor it's a really\nhot day, or you're\nwearing very tight\nfitting clothing,\nthen if you feel it and\nalmost feels like there's\nworms in the scrotum.\nThe other way is to do--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's a scary visual.\nKYLE GILLETT:\n--yeah, bag of worms.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Well, it\nwas just that-- yeah, anyway.\nI think parasites\nwhen I hear that,\nbut that's not what\nyou're referring to.\nYou're talking about\njust the texture.\nKYLE GILLETT: The best way\nfor most people to check\nis to valsalva for a\nlong period of time.\nWhen you valsalva, venous\nreturn will decrease.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can you\nexplain valsalva for people?\nKYLE GILLETT: It's bearing down\nlike you're lifting a weight\nor having a bowel movement,\nwhere you swallow.\nAnd a lot of times,\nyou can almost\nsee build up of blood in\nyou're jugular veins as well.\nSo you have decreased\nblood return\nto the heart and increased\nblood in the veins themselves.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'd like\nto take a brief break\nand thank our sponsor\nInsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data\nfrom your blood and DNA\nto help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach\nyour health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular bloodwork done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a\nlot of blood and DNA\ntests out there, however,\nis that you get data\nback about metabolic factors,\nlipids, and hormones,\nand so forth, but you don't\nknow what to do with those data.\nInsideTracker\nsolves that problem\nand makes it very easy\nfor you to understand\nwhat sorts of nutritional,\nbehavioral, maybe even\nsupplementation-based\ninterventions\nyou might want to\ntake on in order\nto adjust the numbers of those\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\nlipids, and other\nthings that impact\nyour immediate and\nlong-term health to bring\nthose numbers into the\nranges that are appropriate\nand indeed optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to\ntry InsideTracker,\nyou can visit\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nand get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's\ninsidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nSo vitamin D3--\nI'm guessing you're\ntalking about vitamin D3\nspecifically when\nyou say vitamin D--\nand then boron, 5 to\n12 milligrams per day.\nAnd then what are some\nof the other things\nto optimize testosterone\nthat are in supplement form?\nKYLE GILLETT: We can talk\nabout things that affect\nthe steroidogenesis cascade.\nSo we could touch\non tongkat ali.\nI know we've talked about\nthat a little bit before--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But I'm\nguessing a number of people\nprobably haven't heard\nthat conversation.\nKYLE GILLETT: Also\nknown as Long Jack.\nAnd that upregulates\nseveral different enzymes\nin the steroidogenesis cascade.\nAnd by that, what you mean if--\nand this is another good thing\nto Google--\nI think anybody interested\nin hormone optimization\nshould understand where\nsterile hormones come from.\nThey come usually\nfrom cholesterol\nand they can be shunted off\nto vitamin D very easily,\nthey can be shunted\noff to testosterone,\nor estrogens, or progestins\nquite easily as well.\nBut tongkat helps\nwith the conversion\nof multiple key steps where\nyou synthesize testosterone.\nAnother-- think of it as like\na coenzyme or a cofactor--\nan upregulator of these\nsteps is insulin and IGF-1.\nSo a good rule of thumb is if\nyou are not expecting as much\ngrowth hormone,\ninsulin, and IGF-1--\nfor example, lower carb\ndiets, caloric deficits,\nyou're trying to cut\nbody fat or body weight--\nthen tongkat is going to\nbe theoretically especially\npowerful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What\nsorts of dosages of tongkat\ndo you recommend\nto your patients?\nKYLE GILLETT: Anywhere from\n300 to 1,200 milligrams a day.\nWith tongkat, you need\nto be careful with\nthe standardization because--\nand if you're thinking about\na general tongkat supplement,\nwhich is by far the\nmost well-studied--\nthen you're looking at the\neurycomanone content, which\nis a plant compound\nthat is likely\nthe main active\npharmacologic effect.\nSo that's the compound that's\nhaving the effect on the body.\nAnd if you standardize the\neurycomanone very, very high,\nthen theoretically you're having\nmore effect at a lower dose.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\ntake 400 milligrams\nof tongkat ali per day.\nI take it early in\nthe day because it\nhas a bit of a stimulant effect,\nand if I take it after 2:00 PM,\nit starts to inhibit my sleep.\nI've been taking it for years.\nAnd I rather like\nthat the effects.\nIt seems subtle but consistent.\nI've never cycled it.\nDo you recommend cycling it?\nKYLE GILLETT: I don't see\nany reason to cycle it.\nThere is a reason to\ncycle some supplements,\nbut no reason to cycle tongkat.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: My\nblood work tells me\nthat it causes an increase\nin free testosterone for me\nand also a slight increase in\nluteinizing hormone for me.\nWhat are some of the other\neffects on various hormones\nthat you've observed in the\nbloodwork of your patients\ntaking tongkat ali?\nKYLE GILLETT: Tongkat can\nalso slightly increase DHEA.\nAnd if you have a\nvery high SHBG--\nagain, that's the protein\nthat binds up your androgens\nand estrogens-- an extremely\nimportant protein--\nthe higher your SHBG, the\nmore it helps decrease it.\nSo they've studied\ntongkat in populations\nwith very normal SHBGs and\nit does nothing for SHBG.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nDoes that mean it does\nnothing for somebody overall?\nSo if somebody has an SHBG\nthat's in the normal range,\nwill taking tongkat benefit\nthem in any other way?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes, it'll\nincrease their total and free\ntestosterone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nDoes it-- is it known to\nhave effects on anything\nelse like thyroid\nhormone, growth hormone,\nor is it purely in these\nsteroid synthesis pathways?\nOr steroid-- I should say\nsynthesis, and receptor,\nand modulation pathways.\nKYLE GILLETT: There's no direct\neffect on those pathways.\nHowever, any time you alter your\nfree androgen or free estrogen,\nparticularly one without\naltering the other,\nit will alter the\nbinding protein\nthat binds thyroid hormones.\nSo any change you\nmake, whether it's\nnatural optimization\nor hormone replacement,\nyou're going to slightly skew\nyour thyroid hormone profile.\nOne common actionable example\nof this that I see often\nclinically is someone\nstarts, let's say,\nestrogen replacement or\ntestosterone replacement--\nmaybe they're taking an\nAI with their testosterone\nreplacement--\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAromatase inhibitor?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct,\nan aromatase inhibitor,\nwhich blocks the\nconversion to estrogen.\nIf they're taking\ntestosterone and they have\nvery little\nestrogen, then you're\ngoing to decrease the\nbinding protein, also known\nas thyroxine binding globulin,\nwhich binds active thyroid\nhormones.\nSo if you start\nTRT and you either\nhave low aromatase activity\nor no aromatase activity--\nno conversion to estrogen--\nthen your free thyroid hormones\nwill go up.\nEven just acutely, usually\nfeedback inhibition,\nwhich is how the body\ntalks to itself and says,\nwe need to make more of\nthis or less of this.\nBut acutely, there's\nnot always enough time.\nYou're going to have very\nhigh thyroid hormones\nand you can have tachycardia,\nwhich is a fast heart rate\nor you can feel kind\nof like overly fight\nor flight due to\nincreased thyroid hormone\nactivity in the in tissue.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nSo tongkat ali--\njust a broad range--\n300 to 1,200 milligrams per day.\nAnd I realize that the\nsource matters there.\nWhat are some of\nthe other hormones\nthat you prescribe to\nyour patients who do not\nwant to go on testosterone\nreplacement therapy\nor take exogenous DHEA\nor anything like that?\nKYLE GILLETT: We can\ntalk about fadogia next.\nFadogia is interesting because--\nit's a genus of plants.\nFadogia agrestis is one of them.\nThere's many others that\nare very interesting.\nThat species is likely\nthe most well-studied,\nand it will increase\nLH, so I would not\nconsider it an LH mimetic,\nso it doesn't really mimetic.\nBut it increases the release\nof luteinizing hormone\nfrom the pituitary.\nThat's a hormone that\nbinds to the Leydig cell\nto the LH receptor\nkind of like hCG does.\nAnd it will increase the\nrelease of testosterone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I see.\nSo I think for people who\naren't familiar with hCG--\nso human chorionic\ngonadotropin--\nis basically synthetic\nluteinizing hormone\nand luteinizing\nhormone is the hormone\nreleased from the\npituitary that is\ngoing to travel\ndown to the testes\nto stimulate the production\nof sperm and testosterone,\nbut mainly testosterone.\nIs that correct?\nKYLE GILLETT: Mostly correct.\nTechnically,\nsynthetic LH is also\nknown as little r LH,\nor recombinant LH.\nAnd hCG can be\nsynthetic, but often, it\nis just refined from the\nurine of pregnant ladies\nsince the placenta makes it.\nThat's why it's called\nchorionic gonadotropin.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo where are they\ngetting all this\npregnant women's urine?\nI mean, there a location?\nI mean, not that I want\nto go there, I just--\nKYLE GILLETT: Donation?\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --really--\nso there are women that--\nKYLE GILLETT: First\ntrimester pregnant ladies.\nIt's very high.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nDonating their urine,\nand then they're purifying it,\nand then men are injecting it?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wow.\nKYLE GILLETT: And\nthat's actually\nthe same for menopausal ladies.\nSo first trimester\npregnant ladies,\nthat's how you can\nmake non-synthetic hCG.\nAnd then for menotropins\nwhich are also known--\nthere's a couple of different\nnames for it, like menopur.\nYou have menopausal ladies\nthat have very high LH and FSH,\nand then you refine\nthe FSH and LH.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So moving\naway from the sources\nand from urine, Fadogia\nagrestis, what dosages\ndo you have patients take?\nI've heard of some\npotential toxicity\nto the testicular cells.\nKYLE GILLETT: There\nis one study--\nand this is a rat study, but you\ncan equate the dose of toxicity\nin rats and humans.\nThey did not give these\nrats any antioxidants,\nbut it increases a couple\nof different proinflammatory\nmarkers.\nOne is GGT, or gamma\nglutamate transferase.\nIt comes from both the\ntestes and the liver,\nand one is alkaline phosphatase,\nalso known as Alkphos, again,\ncoming from both areas.\nThere are several\ndifferent ways that you\ncan attenuate this increase.\nAnd you can also just check\nto see if you have increased.\nIn the rat dose that equates\nwith humans that had no\neffect-- so the safe dose--\nwas an average of\n300 milligrams a day.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So that\nwould be 300 milligrams a day\nin humans is the dosage\nthat did not have toxicity.\nCorrect?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nAnd often, even if there\nis toxicity in rats,\nthere is not toxicity in humans.\nSo it's not directly\nequitable, but to be safe,\nanother regimen that I have\npeople take is 600 milligrams\nevery other day\nor 600 milligrams\nthree times a week-- often\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This is very\ninteresting and relevant,\nbecause I've been taking\nfadogia for some period of time.\nAll my markers\nand tests indicate\nthat there's no toxicity.\nBut I've been taking\n600 milligrams per day,\nbut I've been cycling it for\nabout 8 to 12 weeks on and then\na few weeks off.\nBut based on what\nyou're saying, I'm\nthinking maybe three times\nper week or every other day\nmight be better.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: If you weren't\ngoing to get any labs,\nthat is certainly the\nregimen that you want.\nIf you're going to check\nyour GGT and ALK phos,\nor even take other things to\nprevent those from increasing,\nthen you can certainly be more\naggressive with your fadogia\ndosing.\nYou can increase it\nquite a bit, and it\nhas a dose dependent response in\nboth the activities associated\nwith high testosterone and\nalso just LH and testosterone.\nSo the more aggressive\nregimen would\nbe 600 milligrams\ndaily for a month\nand then take one\nto two weeks off.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nI think that's more or\nless what I've been doing.\nTerrific.\nIn terms of other\nhormones, what are\nsome of the supplements that\ncan support growth hormone--\na hormone that's\nassociated with tissue\nrepair and, in some cases,\nmetabolism and fat loss?\nWhat are some of the\ntools, nutritional and/or\nsupplement-based, one can do\nto tap on the growth hormone\npathway?\nAnd let's lump\nIGF-1 in there too\nsince they're\nessentially working\nalong the same dimensions.\nKYLE GILLETT: A quick\nsynopsis-- growth hormone\nis a peptide hormone, and it\nis released by the pituitary.\nThere's growth hormone\nreleasing hormone and ghrelin\nthat stimulate the release.\nSo there's also peptides that\nare very analogous to these two\nthings.\nYou have that\npulsatile secretion\nof growth hormone in a very\nfast half life of just minutes,\nand then it increases IGF-1.\nThere is both peripheral IGF-1\nand central IGF-1 and IGF2,\nbut no need to get\ninto the specifics.\nThere is a happy medium to\nwhere your growth hormone is\nat an adequate level and your\nIGF-1 is an adequate level.\nUsually, those\ntwo are congruent.\nSo in most cases, we just check\nan IGF-1 and, occasionally,\nthe binding peptides\nfor IGF-1 kind\nof like SHBG that we\ntalked about earlier,\nbut you're estimating\na free IGF-1.\nIt's kind of confusing\nbecause all hormone--\nalmost all hormones have binding\nproteins to help regulate them.\nBut often, you want to\nlook at free testosterone,\nfree estradiol, free IGF-1--\nor at least estimate\nit-- free cortisol even,\nand free thyroid hormone.\nBut when you're talking about\ngrowth hormone and IGF-1,\nusually you don't need to\ndo anything to optimize it.\nIf you are diabetic,\nthen-- and depending\non the type of diabetes,\nyour IGF-1 and growth hormone\ncan be too high.\nSpecifically, in\ntype 1 diabetes,\nyour growth hormone is extremely\nhigh, but your IGF-1 is low.\nSo if you're in a dysregulated\nstate or have pathology,\nI would just talk to your doctor\nabout IGF-1 or growth hormone.\nTaking amino acids\nbefore you go to bed\ncould potentially help\nwith growth hormone release\njust because most growth hormone\nis released while you sleep.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I've\nheard that fasting\ncan increase growth hormone.\nAnd I know there are certain\npatterns of weight training\nthat can increase\ngrowth hormone.\nSome of those regimens\nin the weight room\nthat increase growth hormone\nhave been covered by Dr. Duncan\nFrench, who was a\nguest on this podcast,\nand so maybe we'll refer\npeople to that episode\nfor the specific protocols--\nthese high volume training.\nKYLE GILLETT: During\nthose training exercises,\nit usually does it transiently\nfor a period of a few hours.\nAnd a lot of this IGF-1 is\nreleased by the muscle itself.\nSo it's not necessarily\nreleased by the liver.\nIGF-1 that is released\ndirectly due to growth hormone\nsignaling-- usually, the\ngrowth hormone comes from\nthe pituitary and binds to\nthe liver where usually,\nit has a half life\nof about a week,\nwhere the paracrine\nor autocrine--\nthink of it as like the\nperipherally acting or acting\nin the muscles itself,\nwhich is also helpful--\nis released and is not as\nconcerning because it's not\nrelated to insulin\nresistance, but it is\nrelated to the training itself.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So fasting\nand growth hormone--\nis it true that fasting can\nincrease growth hormone?\nAnd maybe as a little\nrelated tangent,\nI've heard that limiting\nfood intake for the two hours\nbefore going to\nsleep can increase\nthe pulse of growth hormone that\none experiences during sleep.\nOf course, everyone gets a pulse\nof growth hormone during sleep,\nbut especially\ncarbohydrate-laden meals\ncan blunt that peak that\noccurs during sleep quite\nsubstantially.\nSo two questions-- does avoiding\nfood intake in the two hours\nprior to sleep help increase\ngrowth hormone release?\nMaybe it's being\noverly neurotic.\nMaybe people need to avoid food\nin the four hours before sleep.\nBut regardless, what is the\nrelationship between fasting\nand growth hormone release?\nI find this really interesting.\nKYLE GILLETT: Fasting\ncertainly potently increases\ngrowth hormone release.\nHowever, the IND binding to\nthe receptor is less sensitive.\nSo although fasting does\nincrease growth hormone,\nthe genes that are\ndownstream to it--\nboth the growth\nhormone genes and IGF-1\nrelated gene transcription\nactivity-- will not\nbe significantly higher.\nHowever, if you are optimizing\nthe growth hormone that\nis released as a\npulsatile secretion,\nit is helpful to avoid\neating for two hours.\nSo the general rule of thumb\nis avoid eating about two hours\nbefore bed.\nI think that's clinically\nsignificant and helpful.\nBut fasting otherwise\nspecifically for growth hormone\noptimization in\nsomeone who already\nhas normal growth hormone\nsignaling is not helpful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nThat's extremely useful\nto hear because one\nof the major reasons\nwhy people fast is to get\nthat growth hormone increase.\nBut if they're adjusting things\non the backend that negate\nthat, well, then, no such luck.\nNot that I have anything\nagainst fasting.\nI do a pseudointermittent\nfasting mostly\nbecause I prefer to eat at\nfairly regular times of day.\nSo it doesn't sound\nlike there's a lot\nthat people can take\nin supplement form\nto improve growth hormone.\nWhat about thyroid hormone?\nWhat are some of the things that\npeople can take or do in order\nto make sure that their thyroid\nhormone levels are appropriate?\nKYLE GILLETT: You want to\nhave a balance of iodine\nand you want to have a\ngood source of iodine.\nSo there are some\ncamps that say you\nshould use a huge\nhigh dose of iodine\nand there's protocols for it.\nAnd there are some that say you\nshould use just barely enough\niodine--\nI believe it's like\n200 micrograms per day.\nBut you want to balance.\nOne of the things that I\nsee that many people do not\ntalk about when it comes\nto iodine and thyroid\nis there's compounds\nknown as goitrogens.\nAnd these goitrogens are\nneither good nor evil,\nbut they're actually kind\nof a nice check and balance.\nYou need more iodine if you\nconsume more goitrogens.\nAnd some examples of these are\nsome of my favorite foods--\ncruciferous vegetables.\nBoron is also a goitrogen.\nSo higher goitrogens,\nhigher iodine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo ingesting iodine\ncontaining salt is useful?\nYes or no?\nKYLE GILLETT: Iodized\nsalt does prevent goiter,\nbut it is not necessarily\nthe ideal form of iodine.\nGood forms of iodine\noften come from the ocean.\nIf you look at a chart\nof hypothyroidism,\nthere is a tendency to have\nmore hypothyroidism the more\ninland you go.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So trying to\neat some cruciferous vegetables\neach day would be the best way\nto improve thyroid hormone.\nKYLE GILLETT: Along\nwith plenty of iodine.\nYou don't want too\nmuch iodine signaling.\nMany people are familiar with\nradioactive iodine tablets,\nand that's basically an\nextremely high amount of iodine\nto block out the\nradioactive iodine that\ncomes from after like a\nnuclear meltdown or whatnot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So we've got\ncreatine, betaine, l-carnitine,\nwith allicin garlic\nto offset the TMAO.\nVitamin D3, boron, tongkat\nali, fadogia, some fasting.\nI'd love to talk to\nyou about peptides.\nSo I can imagine a hierarchy.\nA hierarchy starts with\nbehaviors and nutrition.\nBehaviors, of course,\nincludes training,\nand limiting stress, and all the\nthings we talked about before--\nsunshine et cetera--\nand optimize nutrition.\nThen, we talked\nabout supplements--\nall the things we just listed\noff to optimize testosterone.\nAnd we can get into\nthis, but estrogen\nas well, which is important\nfor libido, and brain\nfunction, and tissue function,\nand joints feeling good, et\ncetera.\nBut then we get into the realm\nwhere one might, or could\nconsider, exogenous hormones.\nGet-- taking a small\ndose of testosterone\nor taking a small dose of GH\neven if that were appropriate\nand certainly only\nworking with a doctor.\nBut in between, there's a\nstep of so-called peptides.\nAnd of course, there\nare many peptides.\nWe've already talked\nabout some of them.\nBut when people talk\nabout taking peptides,\nthe ones that I hear\nmost often about\nis a category that\nincreases GH and IGF-1,\nand those to my knowledge go by\nthe things like sermorelin sort\nof a kit of things that\nare taken separately\nor in combination to\nincrease GH and IGF-1.\nBut then other\npeople, for instance,\nare taking peptides like\nBPC 157 to try and improve\ntissue healing and recovery.\nThere's a lot of\ninterest in peptides.\nPlease, if you would,\ntell us about what\nyou know about the\nsafety of peptides\nin terms of their sourcing\nand the utility of peptides.\nIs this something that people\nshould consider before thinking\nabout hormone replacement?\nShould people be\nwary of these things?\nI am very wary of\nparticular sources that are\nsold online that are not clean.\nThey contain contaminants\nand that could be dangerous.\nI really would love your\nthoughts on peptides.\nSo I'm just going to sit back\nand let you riff on peptides,\nbut if you could touch on some\nof the ones that I mentioned,\nI'd be most grateful.\nKYLE GILLETT: A\npeptide is just a chain\nof amino acids between two and\na couple hundred in length.\nSo I think of peptides as\nseveral different categories.\nAnd the GHRPs that\nyou mentioned,\nI would consider those--\nand that stands for Growth\nHormone Releasing Peptide.\nYou have two main types--\nthe ghrelin agonist that\nare-- or they hit the ghrelin\nreceptor, and it helps release\ngrowth hormone because of that.\nAnd then also the\nGHRH-like peptides.\nSo they're very similar to\ngrowth hormone releasing\nhormone.\nOften, they just change\na couple amino acids,\nand it acts like that.\nTesamorelin is one of them,\nsermorelin is another one,\nand CJC is another common one.\nI believe those are all in the\nclass of GHRH-like peptides,\nwhereas ipamorelin or\nibutamoren, which is also\nknown as MK-677, those two\nare in the class of ghrelin\nagonist.\nSo they're more like\nthey hit the receptor\nthat ghrelin does whereas\nthe other ones hit the GHRH\nreceptor.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I think of\nghrelin as making me hungry.\nKYLE GILLETT: Hungry and angry.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nWhy would I want\nto take something that would\nincrease ghrelin signaling?\nKYLE GILLETT: Some people\nare trying to gain weight.\nIt also does increase\nyour growth hormone.\nSo if your growth hormone is\nvery low, you can consider it.\nIbutamoren is a long-acting--\nso it has a long half life, also\nknown as MK-677.\nIt was well-- it\nwas studied mostly\nin growth hormone deficiency.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And do\nthese people get angry also?\nKYLE GILLETT: They can.\nMany people report a\nside effect of anxiety\nor significant hunger.\nMost people take\nit in the evening\nso they don't notice\nthat hunger as much.\nIt can also greatly\nincrease your blood glucose.\nSo if you're insulin\nresistant or pre-diabetic,\nit gets especially concerning.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: This is one of\nthose rare moments where I hear\nsomething and I think, even\nthough there is this kit\nof compounds that can\nincrease GH and IGF-1,\nbased on everything\nyou're telling me,\nmaybe just taking GH is the\nbetter option for those people,\nbecause growth hormone,\nat least it's--\nsynthetic growth\nhormone is mimicking\nan endogenous hormone.\nI mean, certainly not taking\nanything might be the ideal.\nBut for those that want\nto increase growth hormone\nand they want to\nuse pharmacology\nto do that, it sounds like these\npeptides are pretty precarious.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah, it kind\nof depends on the situation.\nIf there's an individual\nthat struggles with hunger\nand not eating enough--\nfor example, someone who has\na very small stomach or they\njust have a very\nlow hunger drive,\nsometimes you want more of\nthat orexigenic signaling.\nThe hypothalamus, you have\nanorexia signaling, which\nis kind of like anorexia,\nand orexigenic signaling,\nwhich is--\nI call it the hangry\ncenter of the hypothalamus\nor the hangry center.\nAnd if there's an imbalance\nbetween those two, then\nperhaps it'd be helpful.\nPotentially theoretically\nhelpful in anorexics, of which,\nthe incidence of anorexia in\nmen is increasing significantly.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: As\nyou're telling me this,\nI'm remembering being\n14 or 15 years old,\nand I would go into\nthe kitchen sometimes,\nand I was so hungry I would\njust obliterate all the food.\nAnd I do remember being--\nI've always been a\npretty high energy guy,\nbut having an immense\namount of energy.\nI can't recall if it was\na hangry feeling or not,\nbut I'm guessing that\nwas growth hormone.\nI grew one foot in a\nsingle academic year,\nso I imagine that was at least\nin part due to growth hormone.\nIn any case, sermorelin\nis the peptide\nthat I hear most often about.\nI admittedly tried a run of it.\nI was researching\na book, and decided\nto take it before sleep\non an empty stomach.\nIt gave me a tremendous\ndepth of sleep,\nbut that sleep was\nreally truncated,\nwhich is just nerd speak for\nsaying deep but short sleep.\nI would wake up after\nvery intense dreams.\nI can't say that it helped\nme recover from exercise that\nmuch.\nI didn't notice any additional\nfat loss or anything.\nSort of abandoned it\nexcept for occasional use.\nAgain, this was\nprescribed by a doctor.\nI'm starting to get the\nsense that these peptides\nand their effects are somewhat\nvague, and distributed,\nand highly individual.\nIs that a fair way\nto describe them?\nKYLE GILLETT: Part\nof the problem\nwith the effect of peptides\nis many people take them\nand levels that are far\nabove the physiologic range.\nEven individuals who are\nchecking their IGF-1 while they\ntake these different\nGHRPs, most of them\ndo not check the binding\npeptides-- for example,\nIGF binding peptide 1, 2, or 3.\nAnd their free IGF-1 level might\nbe significantly different.\nSo common doses that people\nwill take these off-label\nfor as a supplement\nare often much greater\nthan the therapeutic\nor physiologic range.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Which, for\nme, just underscores the fact\nthat it's pretty precarious.\nI mean, I'm not coming in\nhere as the referee of what\nanyone should or shouldn't do.\nI'm just trying to gather\nand distribute information.\nBut I've heard, for instance,\nthat some companies where\npeople can acquire these\nthings without prescription,\nthose companies are not\ngood at cleaning out\nthe lipopolysaccharide--\nthe LPS--\nwhich can cause an\ninflammatory response.\nIn other words, these\nare dirty compounds.\nAnd that just sounds risky.\nIt just sounds--\nfrankly, it just\nsounds really dangerous to me.\nKYLE GILLETT: LPS is a common\nadditive in many companies\nthat are not\npharmacies, but they're\nselling things that people\noften use as human consumption.\nOne interesting note\nabout lipopolysaccharide\nis your gut microbiome actually\nmakes a lot of it as well,\nespecially prevotella which\nis a specific species, that\ncan have to do with your\nbaseline body temperature.\nSo your baseline\nbody temperature\nmight also change depending\non if you're on a peptide that\nhas LPS in it.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yikes,\nyikes, and yikes.\n[CHUCKLES] But I tend to\nbe pretty conservative\nwhen it comes to taking\nanything exogenous.\nBut I do rely on many\nof the supplements\nthat we talked about earlier\nand I do try and optimize\nthe behavioral things\nand nutritional things\nfor a long time.\nSo then leaving\npeptides behind, we\nare now I suppose in the\nterritory of exogenous hormone.\nSo let's say that\nsomebody decides\nthey're not concerned\nwith fertility,\nor they're going to bank sperm,\nor they already have kids,\nor they're going to defer\non this issue of wanting\nto have kids, my\nunderstanding is\nthat nowadays, a lot of people\nare using testosterone--\nlet's not even\ncall it replacement\ntherapy, because some of\nthese people have 600, 700,\nor even 800 nanogram\nper deciliter read.\nSo they're not replacing\nanything that is diminished.\nThey're just trying to\naugment what's already there--\nincrease what's already there.\nMy understanding is that taking\na low dose more frequently\nis going to be more beneficial\nthan the kind of old school\nway of giving 100 or\neven 200 milligrams\nin a single injection\nonce every two weeks.\nIs that right?\nAnd what do you do\nwith your patients?\nSo let me give you\na hypothetical.\nSomebody comes into your office,\nthey do their blood work,\nand they have blood\nlevels of, let's say,\n600 nanogram per\ndeciliter testosterone.\nTheir estrogen is\nalso in normal range.\nEverything else checks\nout, but they're\ncomplaining of slightly\ndiminished libido, slightly\npoor recovery from workouts,\nmaybe reduced motivation\nand drive, although\nno major depression.\nAnd you come to the conclusion\nthat testosterone therapy--\nnot replacement, but\ntestosterone therapy\nmight be a good\noption to explore.\nWhat's a typical dosage\nrange and frequency\nof administration range that\nyou might consider exploring?\nKYLE GILLETT: And some of\nthis depends on the SHBG\nand free testosterone as well.\nSo if that same individual had\na very high SHBG which, again,\nis the binding\nprotein that binds up\nthe testosterone and all\nandrogens and estrogens,\nif it is extremely\nhigh and they have\na free testosterone\nof two, then they\nmight need a different\ndose because they\nneed enough\ntestosterone in order\nto have a normal eugonadal\nfree testosterone.\nBut a general normal dosing\nrange, especially for someone\nstarting, is around\n100 to 120 milligrams\ndivided over the course\nof a week, usually\neither every other day or three\ntimes a week-- occasionally,\ntwice a week.\nMany people with\nSHBG a bit higher\ncan get away pretty\neasily with twice a week.\nThis is assuming that the ester\nis cypionate or enanthate.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So two\n60 milligram injections\nof testosterone\ncypionate per week.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah,\nvery common dosing.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: To hit\nthat 120 milligrams per week\nis kind of the typical average.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nAnd I would consider this like\na physiologic eugonadal dose.\nFor many people, even\n200 milligrams a week\nis far above the\nreference range.\nAll of this is said\nwith the caveat\nthat testosterone is normally\nreleased in a pulsatile manner.\nSo it's high in the\nmorning, low in the evening.\nWhereas if you're on\ntestosterone therapy,\nthen you're going to\nhave a steady state.\nSo your testosterone\nlevel is going\nto be pretty much the\nsame even in the evening.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And\nin your experience,\nwhen patients do\nthat, I'm guessing\nthey report that\nnormal constellation\nof positive effects--\nimproved mood, improved energy,\nimprove sleep, recovery,\net cetera.\nWhat are some of the\nhazards or things that\ncan crop up in bloodwork\nor just subjectively\nthat can be warning signs\nthat even a dosage of 120\nmilligrams divided into these\ntwo or three dosages per week\nis too high?\nKYLE GILLETT: Every\norgan system in the body.\nSo this is when you\nreally have to be\nat least well-versed in\nevery organ system, not just\nthe gonadal genital system.\nYou need to have\ndermatology prowess.\nAcne is very common change.\nLots of different skin\npathologies or even bruising\ncan be related to\nhormone replacement.\nHair loss is very\ncommon to see as well.\nMental status changes.\nIt could occasionally\neven induce\nas a manic or a bipolar episode\nbecause testosterone is also\ndopaminergic.\nAnd then a cardiovascularly\nnot just in the heart,\nbut also concerns for like\nmicrovascular ischemic disease.\nFerritin buildup because\nthe estrogen also increases.\nAnd then fertility concerns as\nwell and lipid concerns too.\nSo you really have to be\nhematologist, dermatologist,\ncardiologist, lipidologist,\nthe whole 9 yards.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo another reason--\nor set of reasons\nrather to, if one\nis considering using\ntestosterone therapy,\nto really do this in\nclose communication\nwith a really good\nphysician because that's\na lot to monitor.\nKnowing whether or not you\nhave acne or not is one thing,\nbut knowing whether or\nnot your LDL is going up,\nyour ApoB is going up,\nthat's a whole other biz\nand that needs to be\ndone through bloodwork\nis what I'm hearing.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nAnd if your physician that\nis managing or prescribing\nyour testosterone\ntherapy or your HRT\nis not well-versed\nin these systems,\nyou would want him\nor her to be part\nof an interdisciplinary\nteam where\nthey have other experts that\ncan monitor those systems.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nskipped over a sort\nof still intermediate set of\nthings-- prescription drugs--\nbut maybe talking\nabout testosterone\nfirst was a bit of\na mistake on my part\nbecause I'm aware that\nthere are-- actually,\nI think there are companies,\nbut certainly groups out there\nthat say, no, wait-- don't\ngo straight from nothing\nto supplements to testosterone.\nOnce you're doing\nbehaviors and optimizing\nnutrition supplements--\nlet's forget peptides--\ninstead of going straight\nto testosterone therapy, one\nidea that many people are\npursuing is to take the\nprescription drugs that trigger\nluteinizing hormones--\nso taking hCG--\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin,\nwhich my understanding is\nwill increase testosterone,\nbut also estrogen.\nOr they'll take things\nlike clomiphene.\nIn fact, I think there are a\nbunch of companies out there\nnow that are saying don't take\ntestosterone-- it shuts down\nspermatogenesis, it shuts\ndown testosterone production--\nclomiphene is the way to go.\nMaybe you could educate us\nabout the hCG monotherapy,\nI think it's called, where\nyou're just mono-- one--\njust taking hCG and\nclomiphene as a--\nand/or clomiphene as a tool\nto ratchet up hormones.\nKYLE GILLETT: So a\nquick points on hCG--\nhuman chorionic\ngonadotropin-- made\nduring especially the first\ntrimester of pregnancy,\nit has effects other than\nbinding to the LH receptor.\nIt also binds to the TSH\nreceptor in the thyroid.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So it's\nthyroid stimulating hormone?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nIn fact, if you look at a\nmolecule of hCG and thyroid\nstimulating hormone, they\nare extremely similar.\nHowever, you need a\nrelatively high dose of hCG\nto bind to the TSH receptor.\nThis is the normal\nmechanism in pregnancy\nthat accounts for the increased\nneed of thyroid hormone--\nusually, about 30% to 40%.\nSo that's why if someone\nhas hypothyroidism,\nyou increase their\ndose of thyroid,\nbecause the hCG is not going\nto be doing it for you.\nThe Clomid, or clomiphene,\nthere's two main--\nI believe it's diastereomers.\nAnd one of them is\nenclomiphene and one of them\nis zuclomiphene.\nAnd these two work\nslightly differently.\nEnclomiphene, I believe,\nhas a faster half life\nand it is potentially\nslightly better tolerated.\nHowever, they were studying it--\nClomid is a very\ncommonly prescribed drug,\nand obviously, there is plenty\nof enclomiphene in Clomid.\nHowever, the drug which\nwas Andrew androxal--\nA-N-D-R-O-X-A-L-- did not go\nall the way through the FDA\napproval process despite\nClomid being FDA approved.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo there's Clomid\nwhich contains clomiphene,\nbut there are also--\nbecause we're talking about\nmale hormone optimization\nthis episode-- there\nare males out there\nwho want to increase their\ntestosterone and other\nhormones-- maybe growth hormone,\net cetera-- who opt to not take\nexogenous testosterone-- so\nno cream, no pellet, no pill,\nno injectable cypionate--\nbut decide to take clomiphene\na couple of times a week.\nMy understanding--\nI've never done this.\nI would say if I had.\nMy understanding is\nthat taking clomiphene--\nmaybe two 50 milligram\ntablets a week\nis what I hear\npeople are doing--\nwill increase what--\nluteinizing hormone,\nthe various estrogen\nreceptor subunits?\nCould you explain how\nclomiphene would benefit anyone,\nand is this a good strategy?\nI'm hearing that it's\nbeing done quite a lot now.\nKYLE GILLETT: It will\nincrease testosterone\nin a dose dependent\nmanner, but it\nhas many other\npharmacodynamic effects, which\nis the effect of\nthe drug on the body\nother than its effect on the\nhypothalamus and the pituitary.\nSo in the hypothalamus\nand the pituitary,\nit does what's called negative\nfeedback inhibition or it\nblocks the action of estrogen.\nSo it crowds out estrogen\nfrom the estrogen receptor\non the hypothalamus\nand the pituitary.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And what's\nthis objective effect\nthat would cause?\nSo to my understanding\nand experience of estrogen\nis that if I ever\ntook-- and I did\ntake a very low dose of an\naromatase inhibitor once\nand I felt terrible.\nActually reduced libido,\njoints felt achy.\nThat's when I discovered that,\nwow, estrogen is actually\nreally important for your brain\nfunction, for joint function,\nand for libido.\nAnd suppressing\nestrogen, for me, it just\nturned out to be the wrong idea.\nBut my levels indicate that\nit's within reference range.\nSo why would I want\nto take something\nthat would increase the activity\nof an estrogen receptor?\nI just can't find the\nrationale for that.\nKYLE GILLETT: The main\nrationale behind taking\na serm is as a very\ntemporary measure that is not\ngoing to suppress pituitary\nor hypothalamic function\nif your testosterone is just\nso drastically low that it\nis unlikely to recover anyway.\nSo most of the time it\nis not clinically useful,\nand serm should\nnot be prescribed\nvery often, certainly not\nas long term testosterone\nreplacement or testosterone\noptimization in most\nindividuals.\nThere's always\nexceptions to everything.\nBut there's five\ndifferent estrogen\nand estrogen-related receptors.\nThere's two main\nestrogen receptors.\nAnd clomid and every serm\nhas a very unique profile\nbecause they selectively inhibit\nsome receptors in some tissues,\nbut not other receptors\nin other tissues.\nFor example, Clomid can inhibit\nreceptors that are in the eye,\nand it can cause visual changes,\nblurry vision, especially\nat higher doses.\nAnd it also acts in every\nother tissue of the body.\nSo a side effects from Clomid\nand other selective estrogen\nreceptor modifiers\nare very common.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nSo I'm at least--\nby my mind, I'm going to\npool them with peptides\nand say it sounds precarious\nand probably not ideal\nfor most people.\nGoing back to testosterone\ntherapy then-- and notice,\nfolks, I've deleted\nthe replacement part\nbecause I think so many people\nare using testosterone therapy\nwithout the need to-- the\nsort of reference range\nneed to replace\nanything, but rather are\nbuilding on what they already\nhave for purposes of increasing\nvitality, et cetera.\nGoing back to that,\nmy understanding\nis that taking hCG\nseveral times per week\ncan help maintain\nspermatogenesis and fertility\neven while people\nare on testosterone.\nBut-- and you and I were\ntalking about this earlier--\nthat there's\ntremendous variation.\nSome people will take a\nsmall amount testosterone\nand just crush\ntheir sperm count.\nThey just won't make\nany viable sperm.\nOther people can maintain\nviable sperm production\nwhile on testosterone,\nespecially\nif they're taking hCG.\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nAnd there's many\nreasons for this.\nSome of this has to do with\nheat damage to the testes,\nso potentially cold therapy\ncould be helpful for that.\nAnd--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Ice\nbaths, cold showers?\nKYLE GILLETT: Mhm.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nYeah, or just avoid--\nand certainly avoiding--\nKYLE GILLETT: Mostly\navoiding heat.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\n--sauna and hot tub.\nYeah.\nKYLE GILLETT: Stopping\nthe daily hot tub\ncan restore fertility\nin many people.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I\nknow a number of people\nthat are trying to\nconceive children that\ngo into the sauna,\nand they'll just\nput a cold pack in their shorts\nor between their legs depending\non whether or not they're\nwearing shorts or not\nwhen they go in.\nOr they'll alternate\nice and heat\nin a way that maintains\ncoolness of the milieu\nin which the sperm live.\nIn other words, they're cooling\ntheir scrotum deliberately\nin order to avoid\nkilling the sperm.\nActually, I saw an\ninteresting paper\nthat said that for every two\ndegree increase in temperature\nof the scrotum, there's a 20%\ndecrease in spermatogenesis\nand viability of sperm.\nAnd that actually, if you\nlook at the difference\nbetween people who\nstand a lot, sit a lot,\nand drive a lot, what you see is\na progressive decrease in sperm\ncount because when\npeople are sitting,\nthere's an increase\nin temperature,\nand then when they're sitting\non the hot seat of the car,\nthere's an-- or using\nthe heated seats,\nactually, it kills sperm.\nI think there are\ngood data on that.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah,\nexcellent data,\nand anecdotally,\nyou see it as well.\nI've had several patients come\nin for fertility consultations.\nAnd all we do is like, no\nmedications, no supplements.\nWe change their--\nseveral lifestyle things.\nVery tight fitting\nclothing is another one.\nAnd soon, they have fertility\nagain and they're no longer--\nthey have sperm whereas\nbefore, they did not.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nI'd like to talk about some\nof the do's and don'ts, but we\nhave talked about a lot of\ndo's-- things that one can do\nto optimize hormones.\nMaybe we could just do sort\nof more rapid fire Q&A on some\nof the don'ts and maybe throw\nin some science where you feel\nit's appropriate.\nCannabis, marijuana,\nTHC-- yes or no--\nit diminishes\ntestosterone levels?\nKYLE GILLETT: Smoked\ncannabis, I would say,\ndiminishes testosterone,\nincreases prolactin.\nThat's a no.\nOther cannabinoids, not\nparticularly harmful.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So CBD?\nKYLE GILLETT: CBD, not\nparticularly harmful.\nSmoked CBD, I'm not sure.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What about\nedible cannabis and THC?\nKYLE GILLETT: As far as I\nknow, edible cannabis and THC\ndoes not significantly\nincrease prolactin to a point\nwhere it would be\ndisruptive of hormones.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Can\nmarijuana, THC, cannabis,\nwhatever you want to call\nit, increase gynecomastia--\nthe growth of male\nbreast tissue?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes,\nit certainly can,\nand there's a pretty good\nassociation between smoked THC\nand gynecomastia.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: What about\nnicotine and testosterone\nand estrogen and other\nhormones-- smoked nicotine?\nKYLE GILLETT: Nicotine\nis particularly\nconcerning not only for\ntestosterone, but also\nfor estrogen. Part of it is, if\nyou're talking about nicotine\nfrom tobacco, there's many\nother carcinogens in it,\nespecially if it's smoked.\nBut nicotine, even\nif it is chewed\nin a dose dependent manner--\nso if you can use an extremely\nsmall amount of nicotine,\nthen it's not as\nconcerning in the long run.\nBut it's a\nvasoconstrictor, and one\nof the main concerns with it\nwould be cardiovascular disease\nor even microvascular\nischemic disease that\ncan lead to\nneurodegenerative disease,\nso like a type of dementia that\ncan be partly due to nicotine.\nIf you use nicotine for a\nvery long period of time,\nespecially at a\nhigher dose, it's\na dose-dependent effect\non your hormone profile.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is that\nalso true for Nicorette\nand other nicotine gums?\nKYLE GILLETT: At\nhigh doses, if you\ncan use an extremely low\ndose of a nicotine gum,\nthen theoretically, that\nwould be maintainable.\nIt's not going to overload\nthe nicotinic receptor.\nYou have acetylcholine\nand the cholinergic system\nis one of your main\nnervous systems, of course.\nAnd you have\nmuscarinic receptors\nand nicotinic receptors,\nand there's just\nbetter ways to optimize your\nnicotinic receptor activity.\nFor example,\nacetylcholine precursors\nlike alpha GPC,\nphosphatidylserine,\nphosphatidylcholine.\nWeak acetylcholinesterase\ninhibitors,\nespecially natural\nones, potentially\nhave a part as well.\nAnd then other alkaloids.\nSo nicotine is an alkaloid\nfrom the tobacco plant.\nThere are other\nplants like cytosine\nand that genus of plants,\nand that alkaloid is also\na nicotine receptor agonist.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Is it true\nthat cycling for too long--\nliterally, bicycling-- sitting\non a bike seat too long\ncan damage the prostate?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes, it\ncan be very concerning,\nespecially if you're seated\nwhile cycling, especially\nif you're putting a lot of\npressure on the perineum.\nYour core is kind\nof like a box where\nyour diaphragm sort of makes the\ntop and your abs and serratus\nmake the front and the sides.\nYour back muscles make the\nback, and then your pelvic floor\nmakes the bottom\nof the box, which\nis arguably the most\nimportant part of your core.\nAnd that pressure\ncan weaken and even\nlead to incontinence\nand impotence.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So we\nwere talking earlier today\nin the gym about how\nheavy legwork, hack\nsquats, deadlifts, those\nkinds of things a lot of guys\nare doing to increase their\ntestosterone, done correctly,\ncan actually\naugment and build up\nthe strength of\nthe pelvic floor.\nDone incorrectly, can actually\nweaken the pelvic floor\nand lead to all sorts of issues,\nincluding sexual effects--\nnegative sexual effects.\nSo how does one go about\nlearning whether or not\ntheir movements are\nbeing done properly\nto support pelvic floor or\nto destruct pelvic floor?\nKYLE GILLETT: The pelvic\nfloor is a constellation\nof muscles just\nlike any other kind\nof like system in the body.\nAnd form is important.\nIf you're doing the valsalva\nmaneuver, which again,\nis that bearing down or deep\nbreath where you feel all\nof your abs are\ntight, you can also\nnotice that your pelvic\nfloor is tight as well.\nIf you have a history of\nan inguinal hernia, which\nis a hole kind of like\nconnecting the abdominal cavity\ndown through the\npelvic floor or even\nthe scrotum in some\ncases-- and that\ncan be a sign that there\nis weakness in that area,\nand you might have\nto concentrate it\non it most, or even\nhave a physiotherapist\nor a physical\ntherapist specifically\ntarget the pelvic floor.\nMany exercises in which\nyou valsalva or use\nyour glutes or\nlegs, you can learn\nto squeeze them and have that\nmind-muscle connection in order\nto help build up\nthe pelvic floor.\nAnd there's other things.\nMany people are\nfamiliar with kegels.\nThat is just one of the\nmany different exercises\nthat can help your pelvic floor.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nMy understanding\nis that while strengthening\nthe pelvic floor is good,\nexcessive contraction\nof the pelvic floor\ncan actually limit blood flow\nto the pelvic area, the penis,\nand so forth.\nSo this is, again, a\ndouble-edged sword.\nI mean, you don't\nwant guys out there\nto just start doing endless\nnumber of kegels every day\nbecause they're actually\ngoing to constrict\nblood flow to that area.\nThere's-- and in fact,\nthe erection response is\nparasympathetic.\nIt's a relaxed induced\nresponse, right?\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So for the--\nthe reason I chuckle is that\nfor--\nbecause we're\ntalking about things,\nwe don't have visuals or\ncharts, and certainly, it's\nhard to know whether or not\na given exercise like kegels\nare going to be\ngood or not good.\nIf it's excessive, what--\nhow many sets and reps\ndoes it take before it\ngoes from good to bad.\nIs there a kind of\ngeneral rule of thumb\nfor people to think about this?\nI mean, clearly blood\nflow to that area\nis key for sexual performance.\nAnd yet when one trains\nthe legs or even walks,\nyou're getting blood flow.\nSo my understanding is this\nthat a combination of weight\ntraining to stimulate\nthe positive hormonal,\nand muscular, and\nconnective tissue growth\nis key provided it's\nnot overtraining,\nbut so is casual exercise\nlike walking, and stretching,\nand the sorts of\nthings that will then\nreturn blood flow to that area.\nIs that an overly basic\nway to think about it\nor will that suffice?\nKYLE GILLETT: I think that's\na good way to think about it.\nI think the main\npoint with kegels\nis they're just one of\nmany different things.\nSo if you're having some\npelvic floor pathology\ncertainly or even just concerned\nabout your pelvic floor,\ndon't just take the advice\ndo kegels and you'll be OK.\nThat is not near enough.\nIt's just one of\nthe many aspects.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So going\nback to the rapid Q&A,\nand then we'll come back\nto this issue of blood flow\nbecause there's some interesting\nscience and protocols there--\nthe question I have\nis, alcohol, does it\nincrease aromatase, the enzyme\nthat converts testosterone\ninto estrogen or not?\nAnd is there a dose\ndependence there?\nKYLE GILLETT: It\nsignificantly does.\nThere is a dose dependence.\nIn general, I would not\nrecommend more than three\nto four standard drinks.\nOne huge glass of wine is\nprobably five standard drinks.\nBut I'd say every two weeks.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah,\nthat's consistent with what\nI discovered researching\nalcohol in an episode we\ndid on alcohol.\nThat no alcohol is definitely\nbetter for all aspects\nof health than any alcohol.\nAnd anyone that says that,\nwell, red wine contains\nthese various things,\nwell, it doesn't\ncontain enough of\nthose positive things\nto have a positive effect.\nBut that if people do\nopt to drink alcohol,\nthat two drinks per week--\nand meaning 20 grams of alcohol,\nso that's probably two 12 ounce\nbeers or two 4 ounce\nglasses of wine--\nis going to be the upper\nlimit beyond which you're\ngoing to start seeing all\nsorts of negative effects.\nKYLE GILLETT: The other thing to\nkeep in mind with alcohol is it\nhas a lot of calories--\nseven kilocalories\nper gram, almost as\nmuch as fat, which is 9.\nAnd then it's also\nvery GABAergic,\nso it can activate\ninhibitory neurotransmission,\nand that can also affect how\nmuch LH and FSH is released.\nSo that can also\ndecrease testosterone\nalmost kind of\nsimilar to how opiates\ncan decrease testosterone.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And I feel\nvery lucky that I don't enjoy\nalcohol-- never really did.\nI can kind of take\nit or leave it.\nI certainly don't like sedatives\nlike Valium or anything\nlike that, which, as\nyou just mentioned,\ncan suppress testosterone.\nYou said the word fat, so\nI'm going to pick up on that\nand say, in order to\noptimize hormone production,\nis it important to have some\nsaturated fat in one's diet?\nAnd what happens on very low\nfat diets to testosterone,\nand estrogen, and\nother steroid hormones?\nKYLE GILLETT: Fat is\ninteresting because there are so\nmany different beneficial fats.\nOmega 3s-- almost every American\ngets plenty of omega 6s--\nin any developed country really.\nWhen it comes to\nsaturated fat, there\nis more of a correlation\nwith hormone optimisation.\nIf you're eating things\nwith saturated fat,\nyou tend to have--\nthose are things with more fat\nsoluble vitamins and things\nthat are very nutrient\ndense otherwise.\nBut it is not vital.\nIn general, you want to\neliminate any trans fat\nunless it's trans fat\nfrom the ruminants.\nThere's always an\nexception to everything.\nSo there are healthy\ntrans omega 3 fats, which\nare formed in the\nstomach of grass fed\nand finished ruminants.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: But\ningesting mostly olive oils,\nmaybe nut butters in limited\namounts because they're\nvery calorie dense, but--\nunless people are trying\nto increase their calories,\nin which case,\nthey're a great source\nof calories, small amounts\nof butter, ghee, probably OK,\nbut not excessive amounts?\nIs that the idea?\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nFat is perfectly fine.\nCholesterol has an interesting--\nso cholesterol and, in general,\nphospholipids make the bilayer\nthat's around the cell.\nBut cholesterol is also a\nhormone in and of itself\nbecause it binds to the\nestrogen-related receptor\nalpha.\nSo I consider that like in the\nestrogen receptor category,\nand that can help\nwith metabolism,\nbut also potentially\nhave concerns\nfor cancer and tumor risk.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I want\nto go back to the prostate\nand talk to you about\nsomething that's\nkind of a newer emerging trend.\nI know that you've talked\na little bit about this\nin previous podcasts, that a\nnumber of men-- or I should say\na number of physicians\nare prescribing\nlow dose tadalafil,\nalso known as Cialis,\nto their male patients.\nSo in dosage ranges of like\n2.5 milligrams to 5 milligrams\nper day, but not for\nerectile dysfunction,\nbut rather for improving\nprostate health.\nAnd presumably, they get sort of\na boost in terms of blood flow\nto the genitalia as well.\nBut again, not specifically to\ndeal with erectile dysfunction,\nbut to deal with prostate health\nand blood flow to the prostate.\nIs that something\nthat you sometimes--\noften prescribe to your\npatients, and of what age?\nKYLE GILLETT: Tadalafil is a\nvery underrated medication.\nThe age would kind of\ndepend on the indication.\nSo tadalafil is also a\nblood pressure medication.\nIt can very slightly\ndecrease blood pressure,\nespecially at higher doses.\nAt higher doses, it--\na high dose would be 20\nmilligrams, not 2.5 milligrams.\nBut consistently,\nit can somewhat\naffect with the cones\nin the eye that have\nto do with red and green sight.\nAlthough, if you remove it,\nthat effect is reversed.\nSo basically, if you don't need\nreally, really good red/green\ndiscrimination, you\ncan take higher doses.\nBut in general, I\nrecommend no higher\nthan 10 milligrams\na day-- usually just\ntwo or 5 milligrams.\nOne other benefit or\nother use of tadalafil\nis that it increases the\ndensity of the androgen receptor\nsimilarly to l-carnitine.\nSo that's an\ninteresting benefit.\nAnother benefit is\nthat if you give it\nto people with\nnocturia, which is\nurinating at night\nin general, it\nwill cut the episodes in half.\nSo it could go\nfrom 2 to 1, which\ncan make a big difference\nfor your sleep, which\nwill secondarily make a big\ndifference for your growth\nhormone and testosterone\noptimization.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nSo you said 2.5 to\n5 milligrams per day\nis typical for these\nprostate enhancing effects.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: And you\nmentioned the potential side\neffects on adjusting\nvisual perception.\nAs a vision scientist,\nthat rings in my mind.\nBut in terms of red/green\ncolor discrimination,\nI'm guessing unless\nyou're going to be\na subject in one of the\nexperiments in my lab\nor you want to be\na fighter pilot,\nchances are you can\nprobably get away\nwith a little less red/green\ncolor discrimination.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nIt's not considered\nclinically significant\nunless someone is\na commercial pilot.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Great.\nKYLE GILLETT: So if someone's\ngetting their pilot exam,\nthat's one of the\nthings we look for.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So\ncommercial pilots aside,\nyou might want to ask\nyour doctor about low dose\ntadalafil for sake of\nenhancing prostate health.\nCertainly monitoring PSA\nprostate specific antigen\nis important.\nI can give an anecdote there.\nWhen I tried sermorelin, one\nof the surprising side effects\nthat was not welcome\nwas a dramatic spike\nin my prostate specific\nantigen. No one\ncould explain to me\nwhy that would happen,\nbut when I stopped\ntaking sermorelin,\nit went back to normal.\nSo that's one reason I\navoid sermorelin, at least,\nfrequent use of sermorelin.\nPSA should be kept--\nwhat-- below levels\nof somewhere between 1 and\n4 is considered healthy?\nIs that right?\nKYLE GILLETT: It\ndepends on the age.\nIf there's a 20-year-old,\nlikely between 0 and 1.\nIf there's a 40-year-old,\nlikely between 1 and 3.\nAnd then if there's\nan 80-year-old,\nit would not be abnormal\nto have a PSA of 5\nand have that be well\nwithin the reference range.\nAnother thing we should\nmention about PSA\nis if you do take a\n5-alpha reductase inhibitor\nlike finasteride or\ndutasteride, often\nthese will cut your PSA in half.\nSo if you-- for example,\nif you have a PSA of 6\nand you start finasteride\nor dutasteride,\nand then you recheck it in\nsix months and it's 6.5,\nthat is a huge concern, because\nthat's actually doubled.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I'm glad\nyou brought this up because I\nalmost overlooked\nthe fact that I\nget a lot of questions about\ndrugs to offset hair loss.\nMost of those drugs are going\nto operate through the DHT\nsystem-- the dihydrotestosterone\nsystem-- for the reasons we\ntalked about before.\nDHT receptors being on the\nscalp and causing beard growth\non the face.\nIs it the case that a number\nof people taking things\nlike Propecia and other\nthings to block the DHT\nor disrupt the DHT\npathway are going\nto experience diminished sex\ndrive, diminished motivation\nand general vigor?\nAnd if, so are there\nalternatives like topical DHT\nantagonists that they\nmight use if they\nwant to keep their hair, but\nnot have those negative effects?\nKYLE GILLETT: The way that\nI think about hair loss\nis you have your fertilizers,\nalso known as growth agonist,\nand then you have\nyour anti-androgens.\nWhether they're systemic\nor topical, there is both,\nbut that's the general laymen's\nway to think about hair loss.\nIf you're only putting\nfertilizer in your hair\nbut you have androgenic alopecia\nor male pattern baldness,\nthen those hairs will\nstill miniaturize,\nand eventually, you'll\nstill have loss.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Such a\ngreat word-- miniaturize.\nIt's enough to send anybody\noff to find a therapeutic.\nKYLE GILLETT: And\nby the way, it's\ndifficult to tell\nif miniaturization\nis happening unless you\nhave a magnifying glass.\nAnd you can use--\nANDREW HUBERMAN: I almost didn't\nknow-- for a second there,\nI didn't know whether or\nnot you were making a joke.\nYou're talking about\nminiaturization\nof the hair follicle.\nKYLE GILLETT: Correct.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: So what can\nreverse that miniaturization?\nGosh, it's just a\nfun word to say.\nI'm going to just\nkeep saying it.\nKYLE GILLETT: Each\nindividual has--\nagain, we mentioned\nthe androgen receptor.\nMales only have one\nandrogen receptor gene\nthat's on their X chromosome.\nSo depending on how sensitive\nthat androgen receptor\nis and depending on the density\nof the receptors in the hair\nfollicle, you can have\nan arbitrary threshold.\nAnd you don't know\nwhat this threshold\nis until you start to\nhave miniaturization\nand loss of hair.\nBut over the threshold,\nthe follicle will die\nand eventually the\nstem cell will leave.\nBut under the\nthreshold, you're OK.\nEvery androgen binds to\nthe same androgen receptor.\nSo there is nothing\nspecial about DHT.\nDHT is just a stronger androgen.\nSo the higher your SHBG--\nthings that increase SHBG\nare beneficial for hair loss\nprevention because you have\nless binding of that receptor.\nSo if you think\nabout hair loss--\nspecifically, androgenic\nor male pattern\nbaldness in the terms of\nthat androgen receptor\nand everything in\ngeneral binding to it--\nnot just DHT, but also\ntestosterone-- it's helpful.\nIt's just that DHT\nis a huge battering\nram whereas the other\nandrogens are just\nlight presses on the door.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Got it.\nSo are some of the\ntopical DHT receptor\nantagonists going to be a\nbetter choice for people\nthat want to maintain their\nhair or grow more hair if they\nwant to avoid side effects?\nKYLE GILLETT: Likely so.\nSome individuals\nbenefit from systemic--\na systemic decrease in DHT\nfor a couple of reasons.\nOne could be prostate and\nthen one could actually\nbe hypertrophy of\nthe myocardium.\nSo DHT also disproportionately\nthickens the ventricle.\nSo for someone on\nTRT, that might\nbe a benefit that is\nprone to thickening\nof the ventricle at baseline.\nHowever, many people that have\njust a bit of predisposition,\nthey can use things that\nare topical anti-androgens.\nKetoconazole is one\nof them, caffeine\nis actually another one.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Wait--\ndrinking caffeine?\nKYLE GILLETT: Topical caffeine.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,\nI was going to say\nmy hair tends to\ngrow pretty fast,\nso it might be-- but I\ndrink a lot of caffeine.\nSo topical caffeine?\nReally, rubbing\ncoffee on their head--\nKYLE GILLETT: Yes.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: --or\ntaking caffeine tablets--\nand how does it-- wait, you\nhave to explain how this works?\nHow do people get caffeine\ninto the hair follicle.\nKYLE GILLETT: Topically, the\ncaffeine enters the scalp\nand crowds out--\nsomewhat crowds out the\nandrogen. It is a weak effect.\nIt's likely just strong enough\nto be clinically significant.\nUsually, caffeine is put into\nformulations with other things\nlike ketoconazole that are\nalso weak anti-androgens.\nOf note, spironolactone can\nbe prescribed topically,\nbut it is absorbed\nsystemically because the size\nof the molecule.\nSo unless your\ndoctor specifically\nprescribes that for you,\nespecially as a male,\ndo not use topical\nspironolactone.\nTopical finasteride is\nalso a smaller molecule,\nso it is also\nsystemically absorbed,\nbut it is not extremely\nwell systemically absorbed.\nIf you take topical\nfinasteride, then usually\nyour systemic DHT will\ndecrease by about 30%.\nTopical dutasteride is likely a\ntiny bit systemically absorbed,\nbut it's unique\nbecause it's half life\nis much faster at a lower dose.\nSo topical dutasteride will\nnot affect your systemic DHT\nat all, and I've seen this\nanecdotally on many people\non topical dutasteride therapy.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: We're going\nto have to get you back on here\nto do an episode all about DHT,\nand hair loss, and hair growth.\nAgain, not a topic that I\nfocus on a lot for myself,\nbut that I get a\nlot of questions\nabout from men and women.\nKYLE GILLETT: One thing\nthat we could mention--\nI got a ton of questions about\nturmeric and curcuminoids\nafter the last episode.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Oh,\nyeah, I had reported\nmy own anecdotal experience that\ntaking turmeric really crushed\nmy DHT levels and I\ndid not feel good.\nI mean, it crushed all sorts of\npositive feelings of vitality.\nThe moment I stopped taking\nturmeric, felt great again.\nKYLE GILLETT: Many\npeople report this.\nAnd the interesting\nthing about turmeric\nis most of it's beneficial\naction-- not all of it--\nsome people benefit\nfrom systemic turmeric.\nAnd some people that\ncan tolerate it-- well,\nit's actually great\nfor the prostate.\nBut most of the action, it does\nnot need to be bioavailable.\nIt acts on the gut microbiome.\nSo you can take turmeric,\nand if it is not absorbed--\nsome turmeric is put in special\nformulations like micellar,\nor liposomal, or complexed.\nBut a lot of it is put\nwith black pepper fruit\nextract, which is also known\nas bioperine, which is actually\nalso a 5-alpha\nreductase inhibitor\nand it affects liver cytochrome.\nAnd so many supplement companies\nput this black pepper fruit\nextract--\nbioperine-- in\nalmost everything.\nSo some people are\non really high doses,\nand that could\nalso be making most\nof the effect of people who\ndo not tolerate turmeric well.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Yeah, I avoid\nturmeric like the plague based\non that one previous\nexperience because it\nwas clearly turmeric that\ncaused the negative effect.\nComing off it, everything\nreversed rapidly.\nAnd the bioperine-- the\nblack pepper extract--\nI also avoid that like the\nplague based on everything\nyou just said.\nI want my 5-alpha\nreductase, I want my DHT\nto be optimized simply\nbecause my understanding is\nDHT is the more\npowerful androgen\nand it's the one that-- yes,\nit causes a little bit of hair\nloss and I've got a few\npatches here and there,\nbut I'm willing\nto live with that\nbased on all the\nother wonderful things\nthat DHT optimization does.\nI'll quickly mention\na few other things.\nOne, saw palmetto is\nalso a 5-alpha reductase\ninhibitor, but only a\ncouple of the isoenzymes.\nThere's three main isoenzymes,\nand a lot of the problem\nis that you're inhibiting\na couple of the isoenzymes,\nbut not the other one.\nFinasteride inhibits 1 and 2.\nDutasteride actually\ninhibits all three.\nAnd finasteride\ninhibits the isoenzyme\nthat is in genital skin, but not\nin the skin throughout the rest\nof your body.\nSo a lot of the side\neffects of finasteride,\nwhich is loss of sensation\nand loss of erectile function,\nhave to do with\nthe disconcordance\nbetween the sensitivity of\nthe genital skin and the skin.\nANDREW HUBERMAN:\nAgain, another reason\nto not disrupt\n5-alpha reductase.\nAnd we'll definitely get you\nback on here to talk about--\nI think we should just do\na whole episode about DHT,\nbecause so often when\npeople are thinking\nabout optimizing hormones,\nespecially males trying\nto optimize their hormones,\nthey're thinking testosterone,\ntestosterone.\nMaybe nowadays, they\nthink a little bit more\nabout free testosterone and\nmaybe they think about estrogen\nas also being important--\nnot to crush estrogen.\nBut DHT is, at least to\nmy mind, the linchpin\nof so many of the things that\nsubjectively people are really\nfocused on-- libido,\nmotivation, drive, et cetera.\nI have one final question--\nit's just a brief one,\nbut many of us have heard\nthat the BPAs that are present\nin plastic bottles and even\nin certain aluminum cans\nand phthalates-- a\ndifficult word to pronounce,\nbut a fun one\nnonetheless-- phthalates--\nand work by Dr. Shanna Swan has\nshown that phthalate exposure\nto the fetus--\nto pregnant mothers and\nto fetuses very likely\nis negatively impacting sperm\ncounts, testosterone levels,\nand even changing genitalia\nsize for the worse in males\nnowadays.\nI saw a beautiful lecture that\nDr. Shanna Swan did on this\nwhen I was in Copenhagen.\nAnd it's very clear\nthat it's negatively\nimpacting the male fetus.\nShe was also on Joe\nRogan's podcast.\nI hope to get her\non this podcast.\nHowever, what she\ncouldn't answer\nfor me was whether or\nnot phthalates, and BPAs,\nand these things\npresent in plastics,\nand some people\nclaim in tap water,\nare bad for males after\nthey're born and after puberty.\nWhat are your thoughts on--\nor I should just ask you,\ndo you drink water out\nof plastic bottles?\nDo you avoid drinking out of\ncans that are not specifically\nnon-BPA containing cans?\nAnd do you actively\navoid phthalates?\nMy understanding\nis that phthalates\nare most enriched in\npesticides, and that's\nwhy you're seeing dramatic\ndrops in sperm and testosterone\nlevels mainly in rural areas\nwhere they're dust cropping.\nKYLE GILLETT: Yeah.\nSo I do avoid drinking out\nof cans that-- or plastics\nthat may have BPA or\nbisphenol A in them.\nBisphenol A is known\nto bind to what\nI would consider the\nfifth estrogen receptor,\nestrogen-related receptor gamma.\nSo it I would consider\nit a xenoestrogen.\nSo phytoestrogens are estrogens\nfrom plants, and in general,\nthey're not concerning or\nclinically significant.\nAnd xenoestrogens are\njust other estrogens.\nSo I do avoid BPA and\nI also test my water.\nI use a water testing\nservice and I test it both\nafter it's through my water\nfilter and the tap water\nthat my two boys drink\nalmost every day.\nAnd it's very interesting.\nI only found one\nmicroplastic just a bit\nover the reference range, so\nit wasn't a terrible tap score.\nBut even in developed countries,\nthese are widely variable.\nAs far as phthalates,\nagain, very\ndifficult and\ninteresting to pronounce,\nbut I remember\nlearning about these\nbecause there is I\nbelieve a lawsuit that\nhad to do with mac and cheese.\nAnd this was probably\nfive years ago,\nand I was coming up\nwith my list of--\neach provider that\ndoes obstetrics\nhas a list what to avoid\nfor the pregnant lady.\nSketchy deli meats\nor high mercury fish\nlike swordfish and\nsalmon, and I actually\nadded processed mac and\ncheese to that list.\nANDREW HUBERMAN: Interesting.\nWell, thank you for that.\nI'm going to extract\nyour statement\nthat you avoid drinking out of\nplastic bottles when possible.\nI'm guessing you're not\nneurotically attached to that.\nIf you were dying of thirst,\nyou might crack a plastic bottle\nof water to survive.\nBut listen, Kyle--\nDr. Gillett-- thank you so much.\nYou gave us an enormous wealth\nof knowledge, everything\nfrom behaviors, to psychology,\nto supplementation,\nto prescription drugs.\nWe will make
