to hear\nthe first 15 minutes or so\nof this episode\nand hopefully that\nwill allow you to\ndiscern whether or not\nyou would like to become\na premium subscriber.\nWithout further ado, let's get\nto answering your questions.\nAnd as always, I will strive\nto be as clear as possible,\nas succinct as possible, and\nas thorough as possible while\nstill answering as many\nquestions per AMA episode\nas I can without these sessions\nbecoming unreasonably long.\nI should also point out\nthat if you asked a question\nand it was not\nanswered this AMA,\nit may very well be\nanswered in the next AMA.\nSo the first question,\nwhich had a lot of upvotes--\nmeaning many people wanted\nthe answer to this question--\ncame from Jackson Lipfert.\nAnd the question was about\nso-called ultradian rhythms.\nFor those of you that are\nnot familiar with ultradian\nrhythms-- ultradian\nrhythms are any rhythms\nthat are shorter than 24 hours.\nAnd typically when\npeople ask about\nor talk about\nultradian rhythms, they\nare referring to\n90-minute rhythms.\nI've talked about these\non the podcast before.\nAnd Jackson's question was--\nhow do you use ultradian rhythms\nin your daily work?\nThere's more to the\nquestion, but first off, I\ndo use ultradian\nrhythms-- that is,\nI leverage the fact that\nthese do exist in all of us\nas a way to engage in\nfocused bouts of mental work\nonce or twice, or sometimes\nthree times per day.\nHowever, I use them\nin a way that's\ngrounded in the research on\nultradian rhythms for learning\nand memory in a\nway that might not\nbe obvious just from\ntheir name that they\nare 90-minute rhythms.\nSo I'll get into the details\nof how to use ultradian rhythms\nto best capture\nneuroplasticity--\nthat is the brain's ability\nto change in response\nto experience-- and in a way\nthat should allow you to get\none or two, or maybe even three\nfocused bouts of learning per\nday, which can greatly\naccelerate learning\nof cognitive material,\nlanguages, mathematics,\nhistory--\nfor sake of school\nor work, or maybe\njust a hobby, or a personal\ninterest of some sort--\nand for skill learning in\nthe physical domain as well.\nJackson then went on to ask--\nyou've mentioned\nbefore that you try\nto include at least one\n90-minute focus block per day\nas part of your work\nand overall mission.\nAnd indeed, that is true.\nI tried to get at least one of\nthese focused ultradian rhythm\nblocks per day.\nThat is a period\nof about 90 minutes\nwhere I'm focused on learning\nsomething or doing something\nthat's cognitively hard,\nalthough typically I\naim for two of these\nsessions per day.\nHe then goes on to ask-- what\nis the maximum number of blocks\nyou can perform sustainably?\nThe answer to that\nis probably four.\nAnd I say probably because\nsome people have schedules,\nlifestyles, in which\nfour 90-minute blocks\nof focused learning\nis possible per day,\nbut that's highly unusual.\nFor most people, it's going to\nbe one or two, maybe three--\nfour, I would place in the\nreally extraordinary end\nof things, maybe if\nyou're cramming for exams\nor you've managed to go on a\nwriting retreat or a learning\nand retreat of some sort where\nyou can devote essentially,\nall of your non-sleeping,\nnon-eating time to learning.\nBut most people simply can't\norganize their life that way.\nSo the short answer is--\nfor me, it's one or two\nper day is the target\nand three would be the maximum.\nYou then went on to ask--\ndo you take vacations\nor extended breaks from these\nultradian rhythm sessions?\nAnd the short answer is no.\nTypically, I try and do this\nevery day-- and yes, even\non the weekends.\nBut on the weekend,\nthe ultradian rhythm\nfocused learning\nbout might just be\nreading a book for\nabout 90 minutes\nor so, which might not be as\ncognitively difficult as it\nis for other sorts of work\nthat I perform during the week.\nI occasionally\nmiss a day entirely\nfor whatever reason--\ntravel, obligations\nrelated to family, et cetera.\nBut in general, I try\nand do this every day.\nI do think that the\ncircuits for focus are,\nI guess the non-biological way\nto put it would be kept warm.\nBut essentially, that accessing\nthe circuits for focus\nis made easier by\naccessing them regularly\nand that's because\nthe circuits for focus\nare indeed themselves\namenable to neuroplasticity.\nIn other words, the more\nyou force yourself to focus,\nthe easier focusing gets.\nI'll now answer the last\npart of the question\nand then I will go through\nand emphasize some tools\nthat anyone can use in order\nto leverage ultradian rhythms\ntoward learning bouts--\neither cognitive learning\nor physical skill learning,\nor a combination of the two.\nThe last part of the\nquestion Jackson asked\nwas-- if you knew you needed\nto drastically increase\nthe amount of focus you do\ndaily, how would you schedule\nthat focus and recover from it?\nThat's an excellent\naspect to this question.\nAnd I will now give\nyou the details\nof how I would use and\nschedule ultradian rhythms.\nI'll offer you a tool--\nI've never talked about this\ntool in the Huberman Lab\npodcast.\nAnd I will dispel a common myth\nabout ultradian rhythms that\npoints to a, believe it or\nnot, an easier way to leverage\nthem for maximum benefit.\nOK.\nSo as I mentioned before,\nultradian rhythms are\nthese 90-minute cycles that\nwe go through from the time\nthat we are born\nuntil the time we die.\nIndeed, even during\nsleep, we are\nexperiencing and\nmore or less governed\nby these ultradian rhythms.\nThis question and this answer\nis not so much about sleep.\nBut just know that when you\ngo to sleep at night until you\nwake up in the morning,\nevery 90 minutes or so,\nyour patterns of sleep-- that is\nthe percentage or ratio rather\nof slow wave sleep to light\nsleep to rapid eye movement\nsleep changes in a way such\nthat each 90-minute cycle gates\nthe next cycle.\nIt flips on switch for\nthe next 90-minute cycle\nthen that 90-minute\ncycle ends, flips\non switch for the next one,\nand so on and so forth.\nI mentioned all that\nbecause during the daytime,\nthe same thing is true.\nBut most people don't know\nwhen the 90-minute all trading\ncycles begin.\nBecause if you\nthink about it, you\ncould wake up on the\nbasis of an alarm clock\nor noise in the room, or\nsimply because you naturally\nwake up in the middle of an\nultradian 90-minute cycle.\nSo does that mean, for instance,\nthat if you wake up 60 minutes\ninto an ultradian cycle\nthat the next 30 minutes\nof your waking--\nright, because that\n60 minutes needs\nto continue to 90 to\ncomplete an ultradian\ncycle-- that the next\n30 minutes after waking\nare related to the\nultradian cycle\nthat you were still in\nduring sleep, or does\nit start a new ultradian cycle.\nAnd the answer is the former.\nThat ultradian cycle\ncontinues even if you wake up\nin the middle of it.\nAnd so a lot of people who want\nto leverage ultradian cycles\nfor learning will say, \"Well,\nhow do I know when to start?\nWhen does it start,\nwhen I hit my stopwatch?\nCan I just set a clock\nand work for 90 minutes?\"\nAnd the short answer is no.\nAnd that might seem\nunfortunate, but the good news\nis that you can figure out when\nyour first proper ultradian\ncycle of the day begins simply\nby asking yourself when are\nyou most alert after waking.\nThat is if you were, say\nto wake up at 7:00 AM\nand let's say that's the end of\nan ultradian cycle or perhaps\nyou're in the middle\nof an ultradian cycle--\ndoesn't matter.\nWhat you need to watch\nfor or pay attention to\nfor a day or so\nis when you start\nto experience your greatest\nstate of mental alertness\nin the morning.\nAnd here, we can discard with\nall the issues and variables\naround caffeine or no caffeine,\nhydrating or no hydrating.\nExercise is one variable that\nwe'll consider in a moment.\nBut here's the deal--\nthese all trading in cycles\nare actually triggered\nby fluctuations in the so-called\nglucocorticoid system--\nthe system that regulates\ncortisol release.\nAnd as some of you have\nprobably heard me say before--\ncortisol, even though it's often\ndiscussed as a terrible thing,\nit's chronic stress, cortisol,\ncortisol, et cetera-- cortisol\nis essential for\nhealth and every day we\nget a rise in cortisol in the\nmorning that is associated\nwith enhanced immune function,\nenhanced alertness, enhanced\nability to focus,\nso on and so forth.\nIn fact, the protocol\nthat I'm always\nbeating the drum\nabout that people\nshould get sunlight\nin their eyes\nas close to waking as possible--\nthat actually enhances\nor increases the peak\nlevel of cortisol that's\nexperienced early in the day.\nAnd that sets in motion a number\nof these ultradian cycles.\nSo for instance, if\nyou wake up at 7:00 AM\nand you find that for the\nfirst hour after waking,\nyou tend to be a\nlittle bit groggy,\nor you happen to be\ngroggy on a given day,\nbut then you notice that your\nattention and alertness starts\nto peak somewhere around\n9:30 AM or 10:00 AM,\nyou can be pretty sure\nthat, that first ultradian\ncycle for learning is going\nto be optimal to start\nat about 9:30 or 10:00 AM.\nHow can I say about if it's\nindeed a 90-minute cycle?\nWell, this is really where\nthe underlying neurobiology\nin these ultradian cycles\nconverge to give you\na specific protocol.\nThe changes in cortisol that\noccur throughout the day\ninvolve--\nyes, a big peak early\nin the day if you're\ngetting your sunlight and\ncaffeine and maybe even some\nexercise early in the day.\nBut typically, that\npeak comes early.\nAnd then across the day the\nbaseline jitters a little bit,\nit comes down, but it\nbounces around a little bit.\nIt's not a flat line,\nif we were to measure\nyour glucocorticoid levels.\nEach one of those little\nbumps corresponds to a shift\nin these ultradian cycles.\nSo if you find that you\nare most alert at 9:30\nor starting to\nbecome alert at 9:30,\nand then typically you have a\npeak of focus and concentration\naround 10:00 AM, that is\nreally valuable to know.\nBecause the way that\nthe molecules that\ncontrol neuroplasticity--\nthat is the changes in neurons\nand other cell types\nin the brain that\nallow your nervous system\nto learn and literally\nfor new connections to\nform between neurons, which\nis basically the\nbasis of learning--\nthose fluctuate according\nto these ultradian cycles.\nWhat does this mean?\nThis means if your peak\nin alertness and focus\nand energy--\ncould even be experienced\nas physical energy occurs\nat about 9:30 AM, I would start\nyour first ultradian cycle\nfor learning somewhere\naround there.\nCertainly 9:30 AM\nwould be ideal,\nbut 10:00 AM would\nbe fine as well.\nAnd then you have\nabout one hour to get\nthe maximum amount\nof learning in even\nwithin that alternating cycle.\nThis is where there's a\nlot of confusion out there,\npeople think, oh, ultradian\ncycles are 90 minutes,\ntherefore, we should be\nin our peak level of focus\nthroughout that 90 minutes.\nIn reality, most people\ntake about 10 or 15 minutes\nto break into a really\ndeep trench of focus\nand then periodically\nthroughout the next hour,\nthey'll pop out\nof that focus, now\nhave to deliberately refocus.\nThis is why, if\npossible, you want\nto turn off Wi-Fi\nconnections and put\nyour phone in the other\nroom or turn it off.\nIf.\nYou do need your\nphone or Wi-Fi, just\nbe aware of how\ndistracting those things\ncan be to getting into\na deep trench of focus.\nBut the point is this--\nthese 90-minute cycles\noccur periodically\nthroughout the day,\nbut there is going\nto be one period\nearly in the day--\nand here, I'm referring\nto the spirit of starting\nat about 9:30 or 10:00\nAM-- and then likely\nanother one in the mid to late\nafternoon that are going to be\nideal for focused learning.\nAnd that focus learning\nbout should ideally\nhave you set your clock--\na stopwatch or something--\nto measure 90 minutes, but do\nassume that there's going to\nbe some jitter at the front end\nwhere you're not going\nto be able to focus\nas deeply as you would like.\nThen you'll get about\nan hour of deep focus\nand then you really\nstart to transition out\nof these ultradian cycles.\nHow do when the afternoon\nultradian cycle occurs?\nWell, just as in the\nmorning, it occurs\nbecause there's a brief,\nbut significant increase\nin the glucocorticoid system\nin the mid to late afternoon.\nI wish I could tell you\nit's going to be 2 PM\nor it's going to be 3:00\nPM-- that's really going\nto depend on the individual.\nWhen you ingest caffeine,\nsome of the other\ndemands of your day.\nBut you can learn\nto recognize when\nthese two periods for\noptimized learning\nwill occur and here\nare the key principles.\nWatch for a day or two--\nmeaning pay attention\nto when you have your peak\nlevels of physical and mental\nenergy in the morning-- that\nis between waking and noon,\nand then again between noon\nand about 6:00 or 7:00 PM.\nAlthough I'm sure that there\nare some late shifted folks that\nwill experience their peak in\nfocus somewhere around 6:00\nor 7:00 PM, especially\nif they're waking up\naround 10:00 or 11:00 AM, as I\nknow some people out there are.\nOnce you know where\nthose peaks in focus\noccur on your schedule,\nset a stopwatch\nfor one ultradian cycle in\nthe early part of the day.\nIn this example,\nI was saying 9:30,\nbut if you can't hop on\nit until 10, that's fine.\nSet it for 90 minutes,\nconsider that block wholly--\nmeaning rule out all\nother distractions.\nBut assume that within\nthat 90-minute block,\nyou are only going to be\nable to focus intensely\nfor about one hour.\nAnd just know that the molecules\nthat control neuroplasticity--\nand these things have names.\nAnd yes, Brain Derived\nNeurotrophic Factor or BDNF\nis the most famous of those,\nbut there are others as well.\nIn fact, the very\nreceptors that control\nsynaptic strength, the\nconnections between neurons,\nsome of the neurotransmitters\nand modulators involved\nin synaptic plasticity,\nthey undergo regulation\nby these ultradian\nchanges in glucocorticoid.\nAnd then try and capture\na second ultradian\nlearning block in the afternoon.\nAgain, just knowing that\nthe first 10 or 15 minutes,\nconsider it mental\nwarm up, and then you\nget about an hour-- it's not\nexactly 60 minutes, but about\nan hour to maximize learning.\nSo if you're trying\nto learn something,\nreally capture it during\nthat phase as well.\nNow, is there a\nthird opportunity\nor a fourth opportunity?\nThis relates to Jackson's\nquestion directly.\nAnd the short answer\nis not really,\nunless you're somebody who\nrequires very little sleep.\nWithin the 12 or\n16 hours that one\ntends to be awake during\nthe day or 18 hours\nthat one tends to be awake,\nthere are really only two\nof these major peaks in the\nglucocorticoid system that\ntrigger the onset of\nthe circadian cycles.\nAgain, there's a ramping\nup and a ramping down\nof glucocorticoids\nthroughout the day.\nBut the real key\nhere is to learn\nwhen you tend to be\nmost focused based\non your regular sleep,\nwake cycle, caffeine\nintake, exercise, et cetera.\nAnd again, that's going to\nvary from person to person.\nAnd you really only have two\nopportunities or two ultradian\ncycles to capture in order\nto get the maximum focus\nchallenging work done a.k.a.\nlearning.\nSo for somebody\nthat wants to learn\nan immense amount of material\nor who has the opportunity\nto capture another\nultradian cycle,\nthe other time where that tends\nto occur is also early days.\nSo some people by\nwaking up early\nand using stimulants like\ncaffeine and hydration\nor some brief\nhigh-intensity exercise,\ncan trigger that cortisol\npulse to shift a little bit\nearlier so that they can\ncapture a morning work\nblock that occurs\nsomewhere, let's\nsay between 6:00 and 7:30 AM.\nSo let's think about\nour typical person--\nat least in my example that's\nwaking up around 7:00 AM.\nAnd then I said, has their first\nultradian work cycle really\nflip on because that bump in\ncortisol around 9:30 or 10:00\nAM.\nIf that person were say to set\ntheir alarm clock for 5:30 AM,\nthen get up, get some artificial\nlight-- if the sun isn't out,\nturn on bright or\nartificial lights,\nor if the sun happens to\nbe up that time of year,\nget some sunlight in your eyes.\nBut irrespective\nof sunlight, were\nto get a little bit of\nbrief high intensity\nexercise maybe 10 or 15 minutes\nof skipping rope or even\njust Jumping Jacks or go\nout for a brief jog, what\nhappens then is the cortisol\npulse starts to shift earlier.\nAnd so the next day\nand the following day\nand so on and so forth--\nprovided they're still doing\nthat exercise first thing and\nideally getting some light\nin their eyes as well--\nwell then they\nhave an opportunity\nto capture an increase\nin cortisol that\nis now shifted from about\n7:00 AM to about 8:30 AM.\nSo they can capture\nan hour of work there\nand then they will also\nstill be within that rising\nphase of cortisol\nin the 9:30 to 10:00\nAM block that lasts\nuntil about 11:30 or so.\nThey might have lunch.\nPerhaps after lunch, they\ndo a Non-Sleep Deep Rest--\nmaybe they, don't maybe you're\na napper or maybe you're not--\ndoesn't really matter.\nAnd then in the afternoon--\nand I would suspect\nit would now be\nin the earlier afternoon\nsometime around 2:00 or 2:30\nwould be typical.\nAlthough again, that exact time\nwill vary person to person.\nThen they would want to schedule\nanother 90-minute work block.\nSo that's how you\ncan capture three.\nNow you can start\nto see also why\ncapturing four\nultradian work blocks\nwould be exceedingly rare.\nIt's just not typical\nthat people are awake\nfor that much of the day, you\nhave to sleep at some point.\nAnd I should mention that if\nyou're going to force yourself\nto wake up earlier on\na consistent basis,\nyou probably should be\ntrying to get to sleep\na little bit earlier as well.\nBecause it's not\njust the quality,\nbut the duration of\nquality sleep that really\nmatters for learning.\nAnd I should also\nremind everybody\nthat the actual\nrewiring of neurons\ndoes not occur during\nany focused work block,\nit actually occurs during\ndeep sleep the following night\nand the following night, and\nduring Non-Sleep Deep Rest.\nThis is why Non-Sleep\nDeep Rest can accelerate\nlearning because it's\nin states of rest\nthat the actual\nconnections between neurons\nstrengthen or weaken\nor new neurons\nare added in a way that allows\nfor what we call learning.\nOK.\nSo one or two all trading work\nblocks per day is typical,\nthree would be\nreally exceptional,\nand four would be extraordinary.\nLook for them-- meaning look to\nsee when you are feeling most\nfocused and alert\ntypically in the period\nbefore waking and\nnoon and typically\nin the period between\nnoon and bedtime,\ngiven your standard intake\nof caffeine and exercise\nand other life events.\nPlease also remember\nthat even though it's\nan ultradian\n90-minute work block,\nthe neuroplasticity is\ngoing to be best triggered\nwithin a 60-minute\nportion of that.\nAnd there's no way to\nknow exactly when that 60\nminutes begins and\nends until you actually\nbegin the work block.\nSo this is really\ndesigned to be empirical,\nyou need to actually go do this.\nWhat you'll notice\nagain is that it's\nhard to focus at\nfirst then you'll\ndrop into a state of focus.\nYou may get distracted,\nthat's perfectly normal.\nYou refocus, get\nback into triggering\nlearning-- that's really\nwhat you're doing,\nyou're triggering learning--\nand then there'll be some taper\nand then you'll be out of\nthe ultradian work block.\nNow, it's also a\nkey to understand\nthat myself and other\npeople should not\nexpect that they're only working\nduring these 90-minute work\nblocks.\nIt's just that a lot of the\nsorts of demands of our day,\nincluding cooking and shopping\nfor groceries, and email,\nand text messaging, and social\nmedia-- a lot of those things\ndon't require intense\nfocus of the sort\nthat I believe Jackson is\nasking about maximizing,\nand that I'm referring to when I\ntalk about these ultradian work\nblocks.\nAnd then as a final\npoint, I've been\ntalking about these ultradian\nwork blocks and focus,\net cetera, in a context\nthat brings to mind ideas\nabout cognitive work.\nSo learning a language,\nlearning math, writing,\nor creating, doing something\nrelated to music, et cetera.\nBut these 90-minute\nultradian work blocks\nalso directly relate to\nphysical skill learning as well\nand to physical\nexercise as well.\nSo if you are somebody who's\nreally interested in improving\nyour fitness and\nyour fitness requires\na lot of focused attention--\nso for instance, when I go\nout for a long run on Sundays,\nwhich is part of\nmy fitness routine,\nI deliberately not\nthinking about much,\nI'm just trying to cruise along.\nI might focus a\nlittle bit on my pace\nin stride, maybe an audiobook\nI'm listening to or a podcast.\nBut typically, I'm\njust cruising along,\nit's low cognitive demand work.\nThese ultradian work\nblocks can really\nbe maximized for\npure cognitive work--\nbook type work, et cetera,\nmusic, et cetera, or they\ncan also be leveraged\ntoward skill learning.\nSo if you're trying\nto learn how to dance\nor how to perform a\nparticular athletic move\nor you're trying to get better\nat some skill that requires\na lot of focus and alignment of\nmuscular movement and cognitive\ndemands, et cetera,\nwell then these\nare also going to be ideal\nfor triggering neuroplasticity\nto get better in the motor skill\nbased domain as it's called,\net cetera.\nIf you'd like to learn\nmore about ultradian\nshifts in neuroplasticity\nand ultradian work bouts,\nI will certainly do more on this\nin the standard Huberman Lab\npodcast.\nBut the key words\nto look up if you\nwant to explore this\nfurther online--\nit's not something that\na lot of people about,\nit's called iterative\nmetaplasticity.\nIt's a vast literature\nand one that I'd\nbe happy to teach you in a\nstandard podcast episode.\nBut in the interest of getting\nto more questions from you\nall, hopefully the\nanswer I've given\nyou now has been complete\nenough, yet clear enough,\nand yet succinct enough\nthat you can start\nto leverage these\nreally powerful aspects\nof iterative metaplasticity and\nultradian rhythms for learning.\nAnd I'd just like to point\nout that these opportunities\nfor focused learning that occur\nin these 90-minute ultradian\ncycles are really\nterrific opportunities.\nThey are offered to you\nat least twice every day\nand you can really learn\nto detect when they occur\nand when they're\nlikely to occur.\nYou can certainly learn at other\ntimes in the 24-hour cycle.\nBut for anyone who's tried to\nstay up late at night cramming\nfor an exam or\nfor somebody who's\ntried to learn during\nthe sleepiest time\nof their afternoon, we can be\nvery familiar with the fact\nthat there are times of day in\nwhich we are best at learning.\nAnd as I've just\ndescribed, there\nare ways to capture\nthose moments\nand they are valuable moments.\nSo even though it's just\nabout three hours per day\nor really only two hours\nper day because of the 60\nto 90-minute thing that I talked\nabout a few minutes ago, learn\nto know when these occur and\nreally treat them as valuable,\nmaybe even wholly in the sense\nthat they are really the times\nthat are offered\nup to you each day\nby your own biology in ways\nthat will allow you to get\nbetter pretty much at anything.\nThank you for joining\nfor the beginning\nof this Ask Me Anything episode.\nTo hear the full episode and to\nhear future episodes of these\nAsk Me Anything sessions, plus\nto receive transcripts of them\nand transcripts of the Huberman\nLab podcast standard channel\nand premium tools not\nreleased anywhere else,\nplease go to\nhubermanlab.com/premium.\nJust to remind you why we\nlaunched the Huberman Lab\npodcast premium channel--\nit's really twofold.\nFirst of all, it's\nto raise support\nfor the standard Huberman\nLab podcast channel, which\nof course, will still be\ncontinued to be released\nevery Monday in full length.\nWe are not going to\nchange the format\nor anything about the\nstandard Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd to fund research--\nin particular,\nresearch done on human beings.\nSo not animal models,\nbut on human beings,\nwhich I think we all\nagree is the species\nthat we are most interested in.\nAnd we are going to\nspecifically fund\nresearch that is aimed\ntoward developing\nfurther protocols for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nAnd those protocols\nwill be distributed\nthrough all channels.\nNot just the premium channel,\nbut through all channels--\nHuberman Lab podcast and\nother media channels.\nSo the idea here is to give\nyou information to your burning\nquestions in depth and\nallow you the opportunity\nto support the research that\nprovides those kinds of answers\nin the first place.\nNow an especially exciting\nfeature of the premium channel\nis that the Tiny\nFoundation has generously\noffered to do a dollar\nfor dollar match\non all funds raised for research\nthrough the premium channel.\nSo this is a terrific\nway that they're\ngoing to amplify whatever funds\ncome in through the premium\nchannel to further support\nresearch for science\nand science related tools for\nmental health, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you'd like to sign up for the\nHuberman Lab Premium channel,\nagain there's a cost\nof $10 per month\nor you can pay $100 up\nfront for the entire
