    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing meditation.\nWe are going to discuss\nthe science of meditation,\nthat is, what happens\nin the brain and body\nwhile we are meditating,\nand we will talk about\nthe science of meditation\nas it relates to how the\nbrain and body change\nas a consequence of meditation,\nthat is, what you export or\ntake from a meditation practice\nthat can impact everything\nfrom your sleep to your mood.\nFor instance, meditation has been shown\nto alleviate symptoms of depression.\nAnd we will also talk about how meditation\ncan be used to enhance focus\nand other states of mind\nthat are useful for work\nand other aspects of life.\nNow, of course, most of you\nhave probably heard of meditation,\nand when we think of meditation,\nmost often, we think of somebody\neither sitting or lying down.\nIf they're sitting, we might imagine them\nin the so-called lotus position,\nyou know, sitting with\nlegs crossed, very upright,\nwith hands on the knees or,\nyou know, crossed in our lap\nor something of that sort.\nTypically, we think of somebody\nwho is in a very calm state,\neyes closed, focused on their\nso-called third eye center.\nThe third eye center is the\narea just behind one's forehead.\nThere's no third eye there,\nat least there shouldn't be,\nbut I'll tell you why it's\ncalled the third eye center\nand what the origins of that are\nand why it's relevant, actually,\nfor a meditative practice.\nWith all that said, it\nturns out that meditation\nencompasses a huge variety\nof different practices.\nSome of those practices\nindeed are done sitting\nor lying down with one's eyes closed,\nfocusing on the third eye center.\nOther of those practices\nare focused on a body scan,\nyou know, really focusing\non one area of the body\nand its contact with whatever surface\nyou happen to be sitting or lying on\nor can be done walking.\nIn fact, there are walking\nmeditations done with eyes open.\nSo there are many different\nforms of meditation,\nbut today, we are going to focus\nmainly on how specific types of meditation\nand specific areas of the brain\nthat are activated\nduring those meditations\nchange our way of being\nin fundamental ways,\nnot just during the meditation practice,\nbut afterwards as well.\nSo if you're somebody who's interested\nin changing your default\nstate of mood or of thinking\nor enhancing your ability to focus\nor improving your sleep\nor improving performance\nin some cognitive or physical endeavor,\nmeditation is powerful,\nbut you want to make sure\nthat you pick the right\nmeditation practice.\nSo we will talk about\npicking a meditation practice\nthat isn't just feasible\nbecause you'll do it\nbut is actually directed at\nthe goals specific to you\nand what you need most.\nSo to give you some sense of\nthe contour of today's episode,\nfirst, I'm going to talk about\nsome of the underlying biology,\nthe mechanisms and the brain areas\nand also the areas of the\nbody that are activated\nduring certain forms of meditation,\nand, equally important,\nwhich areas of the brain and body\nare shut down or reduced in their activity\nduring specific types of meditation.\nThen I'll transition\ninto how to best do a meditation practice,\nhow to get the most out of\nthat meditation practice,\nand then I will talk about how to change\nor alter your meditation practices\naccording to your specific goals\nand as you get better at meditation.\nAnd this can get a little\nbit counterintuitive,\nbut in a positive way.\nWhat I mean by that is, for\ninstance, a lot of people think\nthat as you meditate and\nget better at meditating,\nyou need to meditate\nmore and more and more,\nsort of like if you get better\nat running endurance races\nthat you need to keep\nrunning longer and longer,\nyou know, first a 5K, then a 10K,\nthen a marathon, then ultras.\nWith meditation, it's\nactually quite the opposite.\nThe better that you get\nat dropping into a particular brain state\nand the more your so-called\ntraits of brain state shift,\nnot just states as they're\nsometimes referred to,\nbut traits, this is a\ntheme that I've picked up\nfrom a terrific book\nthat I'll refer to later,\nbut the more that you can get\ninto specific neural circuits quickly,\nactually, the less you need to meditate\nin order to derive the\nbenefits of meditation.\nSo that's a wonderful aspect\nof meditative practices\nthat's unlike a lot of other\nforms of mental exercise\nand cognitive enhancing exercises.\nSo we'll talk about all of that today,\nand I promise that by the\nend of today's episode,\nyou will have a rich array\nof meditative practices\nto select from,\nyou'll know why each of them work\nand why they can be directed\ntoward particular goals\nand how to do that,\nand you'll also know\nhow to modify those meditation practices\nunder conditions where\nyou might get busier\nor where you're suffering\nfrom lack of sleep,\nand I think a lot of people\nwill be excited to know\nthat today we're going to discuss\na specific form of meditation\nthat can indeed reduce your need for sleep\nand still allow you to\nenhance your cognitive\nand physical abilities.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you meet your health goals.\nNow, I've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nOne issue with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you get information back\nabout hormones, blood lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes understanding\nall of that very easy\nand, even better, points\nto specific directives,\nthat is, things you can do\nin terms of your lifestyle,\nyour nutrition,\nsupplementation, et cetera,\nin order to bring those numbers\nrelated to metabolic factors,\nlipids, hormones, et cetera,\ninto the ranges that are optimal for you,\nyour immediate and long-term health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any

the word nootropics.\nI've said this many times before\non this podcast and other podcasts,\nand the reason I don't\nlike the word nootropics\nis that it means smart drugs.\nAnd as a neuroscientist,\nI'm aware that there are neural circuits,\nthat is, connections in the brain and body\nthat underlie things like focus\nor our ability to switch tasks\nor creativity, et cetera.\nThere is no neural\ncircuit for being smart.\nAnd so Thesis understands this,\nand as a consequence, they've\ndeveloped custom nootropics\nthat are designed to\nbring your brain and body\ninto specific states to become,\nfor instance, more focused\nor to engage in creative work\nor to have more energy for\nworkouts and things of that sort.\nAt Thesis, you can go there,\nyou take a brief quiz,\nand they will design a kit\nof four different custom\nnootropics that you can try\nand then modify along with their help\nso that you can develop a\nkit of custom nootropics\nthat are perfect for your needs.\nPerhaps one for creativity,\nanother one for motivation,\nanother one for focus, and\nanother one for energy.\nThey'll build those for you.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first

Stanford,\nand everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with performance in mind.\nNow, I spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with an\nenormous number of challenges\nin order for you to be\nable to see clearly.\nROKA understands this\nand has designed their\nsunglasses and eyeglasses\nto be worn in any number\nof different conditions\nand for you to still be able\nto see with crystal clarity\nThey were designed for things\nlike cycling and running\nso they won't slip off your\nface if they get sweaty,\nthey're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the time,\nI can't even remember\nthat they're on my face,\nthey're so lightweight.\nHowever, they also can be worn anywhere,\nto work, to dinner, et cetera.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic,\nunlike a lot of other\nperformance eyeglasses out there\nthat you can only find in designs\nthat really make people\nlook like a cyborg.\nROKA makes the cyborg versions,\nsome people like those,\nbut they also make versions\nof their eyeglasses and\nsunglasses with frames\nthat you can wear out to\ndinner, to work, et cetera.\nIf you'd like

O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just mention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about meditation.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nwe are going to talk about what\nareas of the brain and body\nare active during meditation\nand after meditation\nand why that can be so beneficial.\nWe will also talk about when\nand how best to meditate.\nNow, this is a topic I've\nlong been interested in.\nI was first given a book on meditation\nwhen I was in high school\nbecause, to make a long story short,\nI was a bit of a wild one\nearly in my high school years,\nand as a consequence of\na program that I was in,\nsomebody handed me a book on meditation.\nThat book is still available now.\nThat book is called \"Wherever\nYou Go, There you Are\"\nby Jon Kabat-Zinn.\nHe was one of the first, not the only,\nbut one of the first people\nto really start popularizing meditation\nand mindfulness practices\nin the United States.\nSo this was in the late 1980s,\nand it was really only until recently\nthat there were very few\nstudies of meditation,\nalthough those really\npicked up in the '90s.\nNow you can find many,\nmany thousands of studies\non meditation and their mechanistic basis,\nso brain imaging studies,\nchanges in hormones in the body.\nBut in the late 1980s\nand in the early 1990s,\nbecause functional imaging of the brain,\nso-called MRI or fMRI, was\nreally just starting to emerge\nas a popular tool in\nlaboratories and hospitals,\nthere really wasn't that much\nmechanistic understanding\nabout how meditation worked,\nbut, of course, there\nwas a deep understanding\nfrom cultures outside the United States\nthat meditation was extremely useful.\nI should just mention,\nas long as we're talking about\nthe history of meditation,\nany discussion about meditation\nis going to be a discussion\nabout states of mind,\nand any discussion about states of mind\ninvokes the word consciousness,\na kind of a dangerous topic\nto get into in any format\nbecause a lot of people\ntalk about consciousness,\nbut people use consciousness, the word,\nto mean different things.\nIt doesn't have one standard\noperational definition\nas scientists call it.\nHowever, discussions about consciousness\nare often part and\nparcel with conversations\nabout things like psychedelics\nand kind of alternative therapies.\nAnd so in the 1960s and\nespecially in the 1970s,\nmeditation and psychedelics\nwere actually close cousins\nin the conversation about\nconsciousness and states of mind.\nThat conversation started to split\ninto two different divisions,\nand I'll explain why in a moment.\nIt gets to a little bit of\ninteresting academic sociology.\nBut what happened was\nthere were a couple of guys\nat Harvard, including\nTimothy Leary and others,\nwho got really interested in psychedelics,\nin particular LSD,\nlysergic acid diethylamide.\nAnd at that time,\nthat was part of the whole\ncounterculture movement,\nit was considered very anti-establishment,\nand they were really\nencouraging students at Harvard\nto take LSD.\nThey were also very\ninterested in meditation.\nBut what ended up happening\nis they essentially got kicked\nout or fired from Harvard,\nand there's a book that I'll refer you to\nin the show note captions\nif you're interested in\nlearning more about all this.\nBut they got kicked out and fired\nfor their emphasis on psychedelics.\nNow, nowadays, there's a lot\nof interest in psychedelics.\nWe've had episodes with\nDr. Matthew Johnson\nfrom Johns Hopkins University\nwho's running clinical trials\non psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD\nfor the treatment of depression and PTSD.\nWe've also had Dr. Nolan\nWilliams on the podcast,\nmy colleague at Stanford\nwho's doing incredible studies\non some of those compounds as well.\nSo nowadays, the conversation\nabout psychedelics\nis coming back,\nand it's somewhat divorced\nfrom the conversation about meditation,\nbut in the 1960s and 1970s,\nthe conversation about\npsychedelics and meditation\nwas sort of one and the same.\nThat changed in the late\n1980s and early 1990s\nwhen people like Jon Kabat-Zinn\nstarted writing books that\nwere purely about meditation\nand suggesting that people\nexplore meditative practices\nfor the utility to bring calmness,\nadjust stress, improve sleep, et cetera,\ndivorced from the conversation\nabout psychedelics.\nNow, that's not to say that\nthe scientific community\nimmediately embraced the\nconversation about meditation.\nIn fact, it took quite a long while\nfor schools like Harvard and Stanford\nand other universities around the world\nto start embracing and\nfunding studies of meditation,\nasking what sorts of\nbrain areas are involved,\nhow it changes the body,\nand, perhaps most importantly,\nhow a meditation practice\ncan shift the brain and body\nwhen somebody is finished meditating\nand is off in their life\ndoing their everyday things.\nIn the late 1980s and\nespecially within the 1990s,\nthe advent of brain imaging technology\nlike magnetic residence imaging, MRI,\nor functional magnetic residence imaging\nwas a way to look at the\nbrain while it was active,\nnot just to get an image of its structure,\nbut also how it's functioning\nin the areas that so-called light up.\nWhen all of that technology\nbecame accessible and popular,\nwell, that allowed a large\nnumber of laboratories\nto start asking how specific patterns\nof thinking and breathing,\nmaybe people sitting\nin the lotus position,\nbut more often than that,\nit would be people inside of an MRI magnet\nbecause it is a magnet,\nthey sort of put you into a little tube\nand push you into the tube, not\nagainst your will of course,\nbut put people into the\ntube, have them meditate,\nand then look at how the brain changed\nand to do that over time.\nWhen those studies were done,\nwhat was discovered was really\nquite miraculous, really.\nAnd now we don't think\nof it as surprising,\nbut what was discovered\nwas a huge laundry list of brain changes.\nAnd then when people were\nevaluated in their outside life,\nso when they would fill out reports\nof their subjective feelings of happiness\nor they would report their sleep,\nor even if objective measures were taken\nlike changes in hormones\nor markers of inflammation, et cetera,\na large list of information\nfell out of that\nwhich revealed that indeed there are many,\na dozen or more clear benefits\nof a regular meditation practice,\nand some of those meditation\npractices could be quite short.\nSo nowadays, we think of meditation\nas pretty commonly accepted,\nand in fact, that has a\nlot to do with the fact\nthat many of the major tech companies\nin the Bay Area during the\n2000s such as Google and Apple\nand any number of different\nsocial media companies\nand other companies and\nbusiness ventures, et cetera,\nand investment firms all over the world\nstarted hiring people to train meditation\nor had online courses for meditation.\nSo nowadays, we think of\nmeditation as this thing\nthat almost everybody\nunderstands can benefit us,\nbut we now sit at an interesting frontier\nwhere most people think of\nmeditation as one thing,\nsort of like the word exercise,\nwhich, of course, could\nmean weight training,\nit could mean running,\nit could mean high-intensity\ninterval training,\nall of which, as you know,\nwill get you different results\ndepending on what you\ndo, how often you do it,\nand the specifics of what you actually do.\nSo, too, meditation can give\nyou very specific results.\nIt can give you more focus,\nit can give you better sleep,\nit can give you a combination of results\njust like exercise can\ndepending on the exercise.\nSo what we are going to talk about next\nis the specific changes\nthat happen in the brain\nwith specific aspects of meditation.\nThat is, what happens\nwhen you close your eyes,\nwhat happens when you\nfocus your attention inward\nversus focusing your attention outward\nbecause, as I mentioned before,\nthere's third eye meditation\nwhere you close your eyes\nand focus on that spot\njust behind your forehead\nand you focus on your breathing.\nThere's also meditation practices\nwhere you're focusing\non what you're eating\nwith a lot of so-called mindfulness,\nbeing very present to\nwhatever's happening,\nnot letting your mind wander\nor think about yesterday or tomorrow\nor what's happening next,\nbut really focusing on the present.\nThere are also meditation\npractices, of course,\nwhere you are in a format of\ninterpersonal communication\nwhere you're really\nlistening very intensely.\nThat, too, is a form of mindfulness.\nSo we're going to parse\neach of these things,\nand we are going to ask\nwhat's happening in the brain and body\nduring each of these meditation practices\nso that you can develop\nspecific meditation practices\nthat you can invoke in your\nreal life on a daily basis\nor, thankfully, I would say,\nfor some who are pretty busy,\nthat you could even do once\na week or even once a month\nthat will still clearly\nbenefit you in specific ways.\nI'd like to spend the\nnext 10 minutes or so\ntalking about the\nneuroscience of meditation,\nand I promise you I'm not\ngoing to just list off\na bunch of different brain areas\nthat are active during meditation.\nThat wouldn't be useful to you.\nIn fact, I don't believe\nin throwing out a lot of nomenclature\nwithout also giving some\nmechanistic explanation\nas to what different brain areas do.\nAnd you could say, \"Well,\nwhat good is it knowing\nwhat different brain\nareas do and their names\nif I can't actually\nmanipulate those brain areas?\"\nBut the good news\nis you actually can\nmanipulate those brain areas.\nAs I'll tell you today,\nyou can turn up the activity\nin certain brain areas\nand turn down the activity\nin specific brain areas\nwith specific elements\nof a meditation practice,\nso that's quite exciting\nand quite different really\nfrom other aspects of neuroscience\nthat we might discuss on this podcast.\nSo there are a few different brain areas\nwhose names I'd like to arm you with.\nAnd again, the names\nthemselves aren't essential,\nbut if you can grasp even the top contour\nof what I'm about to say,\nyou'll be in a much better position\nto parse and use the\ninformation that follows.\nThere's an area of your brain\nthat sits right behind your forehead\nthat's called the prefrontal cortex.\nBasically, it's the\nfront bumper of your head\njust behind the bone, okay?\nThat area just behind your forehead\nthat we call the prefrontal cortex\nactually encompasses a\nlot of different things.\nAnd actually, you have two of them.\nYou have one on the\nright side of your brain\nand you have one on the\nleft side of your brain,\nand they're connected to one another\nbut they actually do different things.\nThe area that I'd like to\nfocus on today for a bit\nis the so-called left prefrontal cortex,\nor if we were going to\nget really specific,\nwe'd say the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex.\nDorsal means up, lateral\nmeans to the side,\nso if you want to touch\nthe left side of your head\nand move your hand just\ntoward the midline,\ntoward the sort of top of\nyour head a little bit,\nso that's dorsal, and then lateral,\nas long as your hand is still\non the side of your head,\nyou're in the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex, okay?\nSo you've got your hand\nprobably right over\nyour left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nThat area of the brain, we\nknow from lesion studies\nwhere it's been damaged\nin animals or humans\nand we know from stimulation studies\nwhere it's been selectively\nstimulated in animals,\nor yes, indeed, also\nit's been done in humans,\nhas an incredible ability to\ncontrol your bodily senses\nand to make sense, that is,\nto interpret what's going on\nin terms of your emotions\nand your bodily sensations.\nSo from now on, unless I say otherwise,\nif I say prefrontal cortex,\nI'm specifically referring\nto the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex,\nbut I'm going to shorten that up\njust for sake of simplicity\nand ease of communication.\nIf I'm going to talk about\nanother area of prefrontal cortex,\nI'll talk about another area,\nbut if I say prefrontal cortex today,\nwhat I mean is left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nStimulation of left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nor, I should say more appropriately,\nwhen your left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex is active,\nyou are in a great position\nto interpret what's going\non with you emotionally,\nto interpret your bodily signals\nof comfort or discomfort,\nand then to make really good decisions\non the basis of that interpretation.\nAnd that's because the left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nis in direct communication with\nand is directly connected\nto another brain area\ncalled the anterior\ncingulate cortex, or ACC.\nNow, I'm just going to refer\nto it as the ACC, okay?\nThe ACC is an area of your brain\nthat is interpreting a\nlot of different things\nabout bodily signals,\nfor instance, how fast you're breathing,\nwhether or not your heart is\nbeating quickly or slowly,\nand, more importantly,\nwhether or not your heart\nis beating quickly or slowly\nfor the circumstance that you are in.\nSo for instance, if\nyou're running up a hill\nand you're even in great shape\nand your heart is beating very fast,\nit's unlikely that you\nare going to be concerned\nabout your heart beating fast\nbecause that is appropriate\nfor the circumstance.\nHowever, if you're just walking along\nand all of a sudden, your heart\nstarts beating very quickly\nfor no apparent reason,\nwell, then you are going to interpret that\nas either pathologic or uncomfortable,\ninappropriate for the context\nthat you happen to be in.\nThe left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nis the area of the brain\nthat actually has some control over\nand especially can interpret\nwhat's going on in this ACC region.\nNow, most of you probably\nhaven't heard of the ACC.\nMost of you probably have\nheard of a brain area\ncalled the amygdala.\nIt's an almond-shaped structure\non the two sides of the brain,\npeople talk about it as\nthe fear center, et cetera.\nBut your ACC, the\nanterior cingulate cortex,\ngets input from areas like the amygdala,\nyour threat detection centers,\nbut it also gets input\nfrom an enormous number\nof other areas of your brain and body,\nincluding your heart, your gut,\nso it gets information about how full,\nthat is, distended, or\nhow empty your gut is.\nIt gets information about\nhow quickly you're breathing\nfrom input from your lungs\nand related structures.\nIt's an absolutely critical station\nfor making sense of what's\ngoing on in your body,\nand it works very closely\nalong with one other structure.\nAnd I promise this is going\nto be the third structure\nin this triad, and then\nI'll stop listing off names.\nSo we have dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nThink of that as sort of the interpreter\nof what's going on inside of you.\nYou have the ACC, or\nanterior cingulate cortex,\nwhich is the area of your brain\nthat's bringing in all this information\nabout what's going on inside your body\nand even on the surface of your body.\nYou know, if you have any pain or an itch\nor a mosquito bite on\nthe surface of your body,\nyour ACC would definitely register that.\nAnd then there's this other\nabsolutely incredible brain structure\nwhich is called the insula,\nI-N-S-U-L-A, insula,\nand the insula has a bunch\nof different parts to it.\nBut the insula is another area\nthat is interpreting signals\nof what's going on in your brain and body,\nso the ACC and the insula\nare working together\nto try and figure out, you\nknow, what's going on inside me?\nAnd in addition to that,\nthe insula is interpreting information\nabout what's going on outside of you.\nSo your insula is saying, for instance,\nhey, this is a steep\nhill that I'm running up,\nand as a consequence,\nwhatever heart rate increase\nthat I'm experiencing\nor heavy breathing or burning in my lungs,\nthis all makes sense.\nI don't have to be worried,\nI don't have to be scared.\nI might want to slow down,\nbut this makes sense.\nWhereas, for instance, in the\nexample I previously gave,\nwhere if you're sitting in a room\nand everything is pretty calm,\nand all of a sudden, you start\nfeeling really uncomfortable,\nlike your stomach doesn't feel right\nor you start breathing quickly\nor you start having a so-called\nanxiety or panic attack,\nin large part, that's because the shift\nin your bodily sensations doesn't match\nor doesn't correspond to\nsomething in the outside world.\nSo there's this incredible triad\nwhich includes the left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex,\nthe cingulate or anterior\ncingulate cortex, and the insula,\nand those three are working together\nin a kind of conversation,\nit's a neural conversation,\nbut a conversation nonetheless,\ntrying to figure out, okay,\nwhat's going on inside me?\nHow do I feel? What am I thinking about?\nAnd this could be thoughts about the past\nor the future or the present.\nThey are also in a conversation\nas to whether or not the sensations\nthat you're experiencing,\nmeaning how quick your breathing is\nor how slow your breathing is,\nhow your heart feels, how your skin feels,\nany sensations of pain, or\npleasure for that matter,\nwhether or not that makes sense\nfor the situation you're in\nand trying to determine\nwhether or not you are\ndoing the right things\nas a consequence of those sensations.\nOkay, so again, if you\ncan't remember the names\nof these different neural\nstructures in the brain,\ndon't worry about it.\nIt's really not that critical.\nWhat is critical is that you understand\nthat there's a conversation\nthat's constantly occurring\nas long as you are awake\ntrying to figure out what's\ngoing on inside of you\nand whether or not it makes sense\nrelative to what's going\non outside and around you.\nNow, humans are smart.\nThat is, we are, to some\nextent, conscious of the fact\nthat we have memories of the\npast, awareness of the present,\nand anticipation of the future.\nSo we do realize, for instance,\nthat we can be seated at\nthe dinner table, excuse me,\nand have a thought about\nsomething tomorrow,\nmaybe an exam that's stressing us out\nor something like that,\nand that will change our bodily state\nin a way that is not optimal\nfor what we're doing in the moment\nbut that can still make sense to us\nbecause that exam is important,\nmaybe we're feeling some pressure\nabout a hard conversation we have to have,\nor maybe we are very\nexcited about the next day\nand we can't eat because we're so excited,\nand that can make perfect sense to us\nbecause we do have access\nto this knowledge about self\nthat we can think about the past,\nthe present, or the future.\nSo that makes the conversation\nthese three structures are in\neven more interesting and dynamic\nbecause what it means is that\nwe can be doing something,\neating, talking, running,\nany number of different activities,\nand our bodily state may or\nmay not match what we are doing\nin a way that's adaptive for that,\nand yet that can be completely okay\nor at least understandable for us.\nNow, a major emphasis\nof a meditation practice\nis to make us so-called more mindful.\nWhat is mindfulness?\nWell, again, there isn't one perfect\nuniversally accepted operational\ndefinition of mindfulness.\nThat's basically nerd speak\nfor saying people can't agree\nexactly what mindfulness\nshould be, is, and means for everyone.\nBut most people assume, and I think agree,\nthat mindfulness includes\nsomething about being present.\nAnd when I say present,\nthat doesn't necessarily mean\npresent to one's surroundings\nbecause of course a lot\nof meditation practices\nthat are designed to make\nus more mindful and present\nare designed to make us\nmore mindful and present\nto what's happening internally\nwhile ignoring everything\nthat's happening externally,\nbut they are designed\nto make us more present\nto our bodily sensations\nand, in particular, our\nbreathing and our thoughts\nin the moment.\nSo let's now explore\nwhat a generic meditation\npractice looks like,\nand let's evaluate how that\ntends to change the activity\nof these neural circuits\nin the brain and body.\nAnd then from there, we\ncan split the conversation\ninto a couple of different bins,\nthat is, meditation\npractices that are ideal\nfor enhancing focus,\nmeditation practices that\nare ideal for improving mood,\nmeditation practices that are\nideal for improving sleep,\nand meditation practices\nthat, believe it or not,\nbenefit all of those\nthings in one fell swoop.\nOkay, so what happens\nduring a meditation practice\nat the neural level?\nIn order to answer that question,\nwe are going to be scientists.\nThat means you and I are\ngoing to be scientists now.\nWe are going to break down a practice\ninto its different component parts\nand address what we know for sure\nabout the brain activation\nstates that occur\nwith those different component parts.\nIn order to do that,\nlet's use a somewhat\ngeneric form of meditation,\nbut it's generic and pretty far-reaching\nbecause I would say that for most people,\nabout 75%, let's say,\na meditation practice is\ngoing to involve stopping,\nmeaning getting out of\nmotion, sitting or lying down,\nand, in most cases, closing one's eyes,\nalthough it is absolutely not required\nto close one's eyes during meditation.\nThere are many forms of meditation\nthat are done eyes open.\nBut for most people,\nit's going to involve\nstopping our movement,\nthat is, not ambulating,\nnot walking or running,\nso seated or lying down with eyes closed.\nWhen we do that,\nmeaning when we sit or lie\ndown and close our eyes,\nas trivial as that shift\nmight sound to you,\nit actually is a profound shift\nin the way that your brain\nand other neural circuits\nin your body function\nfor the following reason.\nWhen we close our eyes,\nwe shut down a major avenue of\nwhat's called exteroception.\nWhat do I mean by exteroception?\nWell, very briefly, we are\nsensing things on our body\nand in our body all the time.\nWe are also sensing things from\noutside of us all the time,\nso these could be sights or\nsounds, touch on our body,\nsensations withinside our body, et cetera.\nNow, sensation is distinct\nfrom what we call perception.\nPerception is, put simply,\nthe sensations that we happen\nto be paying attention to.\nSo at any given moment, you\nare sensing many, many things.\nThere are sound waves hitting your ears,\nthere are pressure receptors\non the bottoms of your feet\nsensing your shoes or your\nsandals or the floor, et cetera,\nbut you're not perceiving them\nuntil you place your attention on them.\nNow, the way perception works\nis that you have so-called\nspotlights of attention.\nYou can't perceive everything all at once,\nevery sound, every sight, every touch.\nThat would be overwhelming. In\nfact, that would be terrible.\nRather you have spotlights of perception\nthat can either be very narrow,\nso for instance,\nyou could focus all of\nyour perception right now\non your big toe of your right foot\nand really pour all of your\nawareness, your attention\ninto what you're perceiving\nthere, what it feels like,\nif there's tingling or pressure,\nheat or cold, et cetera,\nor you can broaden that\nspotlight to include both feet\nor all your toes on both feet\nand then your legs and your\nwhole body or the entire room.\nPerception is like a spotlight,\nand I should mention\nthere are very good data\nthat we can split our attention into two\nbut probably not more than two spotlights,\nand we can make those\nspotlights of perception\neither very broad and\ndiffuse or very narrow.\nYou can practice this now if you like.\nYou can pick a spot on the\nwall away from you anywhere,\nor if you're driving, you\ncan look at some location,\nand you can focus intensely\non one small location,\nfor instance, a tree in the horizon\nor a person on the street\nor any number of different\nthings outside of you,\nor you can broaden that spotlight\nto include the entire scene at once.\nYou can also focus a spotlight\nof perception on your body,\nsay on the left upper\nportion of your chest.\nAnd of course you can focus\non the left upper portion of your chest\nand something outside of you,\nyou can split your attention\nbetween those two perceptual spotlights.\nIt's very hard, although not impossible,\nto have three perceptual spotlights,\nbut most people can split to two points\nof attention or perception pretty easily.\nThe other thing that most\npeople can do pretty easily\nis merge those two spotlights\nor, rather, to have just\none spotlight of attention.\nSo you don't always have\nto have two spotlights of attention on,\nand here, I'm using the word attention\nand perception interchangeably.\nBut you could, for instance,\nhave two points of attention,\nso you're talking to somebody\nand you're paying attention\nto whether or not somebody's\nwalking in the door or not,\nso that's two,\nor you could be completely focused\non the person you're talking to,\nor you could be completely\nfocused on the stomach ache\nor the great sensation of hunger\nthat you have in your belly\nwhile talking to somebody,\nin fact, you're not even listening\nto what they're saying at all.\nOkay? So you have two\nspotlights of perception.\nYou can split them or merge them into one.\nAnd, this is very important,\nthose spotlights of perception\ncan intensify or dim,\nand there, I'm using analogy.\nWhat I mean by that is your\nperception of what's happening\nwithin those spotlights can\nbe very, very high acuity.\nThat is, you can register\nvery fine changes in detail\nlike tingling on one side of\nyour big toe of your right foot\nversus the other,\nor it can be somewhat more diffuse.\nYou're just thinking about your whole toe,\nwhich, in that case,\nseems like a small area,\nbut the point is that you can\nconsciously adjust the acuity,\nthat is, the fineness of your perception.\nAll of this is under your power\nbecause of the incredible\nability of a brain structure\nwhose name you now understand and know,\nwhich is the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex,\nalthough there are other\nareas of your brain\ninvolved as well.\nYour ability to direct your\nattention to specific things\nin your environment or within your body\nor to split those points\nof attention or merge them\nor dial up the intensity\nof how closely you're paying attention\nto every little shift or ripple\nand change in sensation there\nor to kind of dissociate, if you will,\nfor lack of a better word,\nto disengage from that perception,\nall of that is under control\nbecause of your ability\nto engage this area that we\ncall the prefrontal cortex,\nand, in particular, the left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day\nis that it gets me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\nthat communicate with the\nbrain, the immune system,\nand basically all the\nbiological systems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health,\nand those probiotics in Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens, vitamins,\nand minerals that make sure\nthat all of my foundational\nnutritional needs are met,\nand it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera,\nand they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3+K2.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.\nOkay, so now if we look at\nthe example of what happens\nwhen you sit or lie\ndown and close your eyes\nand decide to meditate,\nyou should immediately realize\nthat that's a tremendous shift\nin your perceptual ability, why?\nBecause that spotlight of attention,\nwhile it can be oriented\ntoward, for instance,\nwhat you hear in the room\nor maybe the feeling of wind moving trees\nin the environment that\nyou happen to be in,\nwhen we close our eyes,\nwe shut down one of the major\navenues for sensory input,\nwhich is vision.\nAnd when we do that,\nthere's a tendency for\nthose perceptual spotlights\nto be focused more so on what happens\nat the level of the surface of our skin\nand inside of our bodies.\nAnd that informs us about\nsomething very important,\nwhich is that there are actually two axes\nor two ends of a continuum of perception.\nUp until now, I've been\ntalking about perception\nand intention as kind of the same thing,\nand indeed they are, at least\nfor sake of this conversation,\nbut within that word perception\nor within that word attention,\nthere's a continuum,\nand that continuum has on one end\nsomething called interoception.\nInteroception, spelled with an I,\nis everything that we sense\nat the level of our skin and inward,\nso the sensation inside our stomach,\nthe sensation of our heart beating.\nSome people can sense their\nheart beating pretty easily.\nOther people have more\nchallenge doing that.\nWhat we are feeling on\nthe surface of our skin,\nhow hot or cold we feel,\nthat's interoception.\nIn contrast, at the other\nend of the continuum\nis so-called exteroception,\nspelled with an E.\nExteroception is perception of everything\nthat's outside or beyond\nthe confines of our skin.\nSo by shutting our eyes,\nand in particular, in\na meditative practice\nwhere we direct our attention\ntoward our so-called third eye center,\nthis area right behind our forehead,\nwhich, not so incidentally,\nis the prefrontal cortex,\nor in some cases where people\nwill focus on their breathing,\nso the movement of their stomach\nor the movement of their diaphragm\nor the lifting of their chest\nor the extension of their\nbelly while they breathe.\nBy doing that,\nwe are taking what ordinarily\nis a perceptual state\nthat's split between the\noutside world, exteroception,\nand usually also toward our inner state.\nYou know, most people\nare generally in touch\nwith how they are feeling\nfrom the skin inward\nwhile they are also paying attention\nto what's outside of them.\nYou can think about somebody,\nfor instance, at a\nrestaurant or a sandwich shop\nabout to order a sandwich\nand you're reading the menu,\nso that's exteroception, right?\nThe menu is outside the\nconfines of your skin.\nAnd little ideas or maybe\nbig ideas come to mind\nabout what the roast beef sandwich\nor the vegetarian\nsandwich will taste like,\nwhat it will do for you,\nwhat's in it, what you like,\nwhat you don't like, et cetera.\nThat's splitting interoception\nand exteroception.\nBut when we close our eyes,\nwe stop, we slow down,\nwe focus on our breathing\nor that third eye center,\nthe majority of our perception\nthen shifts to interoception.\nAnd when we shift down\nto that end of the\ncontinuum of interoception,\nsomething very important happens.\nWhat happens is that those two regions,\nthe ACC, the anterior cingulate\ncortex, and the insula,\nreally ramp up their\nlevels of neural activity,\nand that should make perfect sense to you\nbecause those are areas of\nyour brain that are registering\nand paying attention to\nthe various sensations\nof how full or empty your stomach feels,\nwhether or not the surface of\nyour skin feels hot or cold,\nand on and on.\nSo by just sitting down or lying\ndown and closing your eyes,\nyour brain undergoes a massive shift\nfrom exteroception to interoception.\nNow, that's not to say\nyou can't be distracted\nby external events, and,\nin fact, many people are,\nbut the early stages of transitioning\ninto a meditative state\ninvolve this shift down the continuum,\nor, I should say, to\none end of the continuum\nbecause there's no down-up,\nthere's just the continuum,\nshift along the continuum\nto heightened levels of interoception.\nNow, I mentioned this briefly before,\nbut many people are very\ninteroceptively aware\njust naturally, even if they\ndon't do a meditation practice.\nOther people are not.\nAnd there's a pretty good measure\nof whether or not you have high levels\nof interoceptive awareness or capability,\nand that is your ability\nto count your heartbeats\nwithout placing your fingers\nanywhere with any pressure\nto take your pulse.\nYou can do this if you like,\nyou can actually try and estimate\nyour number of heartbeats\nsimply by trying to feel your heart beat.\nSome people are very good,\nmeaning they're very\naccurate at doing this,\nother people are not.\nIt does seem to be an ability\nthat can be trained up quite a bit,\nand, in fact, meditative practices\nwill improve your interoceptive awareness,\nbut, and this is a very important point,\nheightened levels of\ninteroceptive awareness,\nwhile that might sound attractive,\noh, to be really in touch with your body,\nthat is not always beneficial, why?\nBecause many people who, for instance,\nhave excessive levels of anxiety\nhave excessive levels of anxiety\nbecause they are very keenly aware\nof any subtle shift in their\nheart rate or breathing\nor change in the sensations\nwithin their stomach.\nWhereas other people who are less aware\nof their bodily state, that\ncan be beneficial, right?\nIt can be adaptive or not,\ndepending on the circumstances.\nIt's probably not adaptive\nto be very, very aware\nof your internal state\nif, for instance, you're\ndoing public speaking,\nyou don't want to be thinking\nabout what's going on in your stomach\nor how quickly you're breathing.\nI'm certainly trying to\nignore all those signals,\nthose sensations now.\nBut for somebody who has no\nawareness of what's going on,\nvery little interoceptive awareness,\nthat can be problematic, too,\nbecause these are the very people\nwho can ignore the fact that\nthey're having a heart attack\nor can ignore the fact that\nthey have high blood pressure\nand are carrying about life\nfocused on everything external\nwith no awareness of their own body.\nThey're, quote, unquote, out\nof touch with their body.\nSo we want to be very careful\nabout placing valence,\nwhich is a sort of value of good or bad\non interoceptive awareness\nversus exteroceptive awareness.\nMore importantly, we want to emphasize\nthat when you undergo\na meditation practice,\nif it's of the sort where\nyou stop your movement\nand close your eyes,\nyou are training for\ninteroceptive awareness.\nThis becomes important later\nwhen we get into discussions\nabout meditation for reducing anxiety.\nSome people may opt,\nin fact, I would say\nsome people ought to opt\nfor a meditative practice\nwhich involves more\nexteroceptive awareness,\nactually a meditation\nlike a walking meditation\nor even a seated meditation\nwhere they are bringing their focus\nto a place outside their body\nas opposed to inside their body.\nAnd in fact, there are examples of people\nwho have meditated quite a lot\nwho develop such a\nheightened state or awareness\nof their interoceptive components,\nthat is, just fancy, again, nerd speak\nfor so aware of their\nbreathing and of their heart\nand of the state of their gut\nthat it actually is intrusive\nfor daily activities.\nSo I will ask you to ask this\nquestion of yourself now.\nAre you somebody who\ntends to be very in touch\nwith your bodily sensations,\nso, for instance, from the skin inwards?\nOr are you somebody who tends\nto be less in touch with\nor aware of your interoceptive state?\nThere is no right or wrong answer.\nYou don't get an A or an F or a D or a C\ndepending on your answer.\nIt's just a good question\nfor each and every one of us to answer,\nand I think most people\nwill answer that it depends.\nIt depends on whether or not\nyou are in a social setting\nor whether or not you're alone.\nBut we are going to return to\nthat answer so keep it in mind\nbecause it will become very beneficial\nin building an optimal\nmeditation practice for you.\nBut for now, just note,\nthere's this continuum of perception,\ninteroception and exteroception.\nClosing your eyes increases interoception.\nOpening your eyes dramatically\nincreases exteroception\njust automatically,\njust automatically because\nso much of your brain,\nin fact, 40% or more,\nis dedicated to vision.\nAnd this, I should say, for those of you\nthat are low vision or no vision\nand those of you that are\nblind or have poor vision,\nthis entire process is\ntranslated to the auditory,\nto the sound domain,\nso it's true for people that can see\nand it's true for people that can't see.\nOf course, people that\ncan't see, closing the eyes\ndoesn't have this huge\nshift towards interoception,\nbut there have been a few studies,\nnot as many as I would've liked to find,\nbut a few studies of, for\ninstance, people who are blind\nor have low vision, don't see very well,\nand when they close their ears\nand they can't hear the external world\nor they put headphones on or\nnoise-canceling headphones,\nthen the world inside of\nthem becomes very prominent\nrelative to the world outside\nof them for obvious reasons.\nSo I asked you to ask yourself\nwhether or not you are somebody\nwho tends to be more\ninteroceptively aware or not,\nmore exteroceptively aware or not.\nAnd some of you might not be\nable to answer that question,\nand if you can't, chances are\nthat you are effectively\nsliding along that continuum\ndepending on the activities\nthat you're doing.\nSo you're probably the kind of person\nwhere if somebody comes over to you\nand starts talking to you,\nyou will engage in that conversation,\nand you don't feel so inside your body\nthat you're thinking\nabout your heart beating\nand whether or not you're\nflushing red, et cetera,\nyou're going to pay\nattention to what they say.\nMany people, however, when\nsomebody talks to them,\nif they have social anxiety\nor even a slight bit of social anxiety,\nwill be thinking about whether or not\ntheir cheeks are flushing\nor whether or not they\nlook right or sound right\nor whether or not they have\nsomething in their teeth.\nThese are normal responses,\nbut they really speak to this issue\nof whether or not you tend to shift\nmore towards interoceptive awareness\nor exteroceptive awareness.\nAnd, of course, it's context dependent.\nIt will depend on whether or not\nyou're, you know, out\non a date with somebody\nthat, you know, you would\nloathe to find out later\nthat you had food in your teeth\nor whether or not you're with somebody\nyou're more familiar with\nwhere that would not really matter much\nor the other person would\ntell you this kind of thing.\nWhat does it mean to be at one\nlocation or another location\nalong this continuum of\ninteroception or exteroception?\nWell, we know what it\nmeans neurally, right?\nWe know that if you are\nmore interoceptively aware,\nyour insula and ACC are active,\nbut that's not very useful.\nThat's not helpful as a\ntool. That's just a fact.\nNow, there have actually been studies\nof what a meditation practice can do\nin terms of moving you\nalong this continuum\nfrom where you naturally sit\nin order to help you function\nnot just during the\nmeditation but at all times.\nAnd in order to illustrate this,\nI want to start with a description\nof what is now a classic study.\nIt's a very cool study,\nit has a very cool name.\nIt talks about something very important\nthat will come up again and\nagain in today's conversation,\nand that's something called\nthe default mode network.\nThe default mode network\nis a collection of different brain areas\nthat essentially are active\nwhen we're not doing much of anything\nand certainly is active\nwhen we are not focused\non one particular task or\nconversation or activity.\nThe default mode network can\nbe thought of more or less\nas the network that\ngenerates mind wandering\nor our thoughts drifting from the past\nto the present to the future.\nRemember, earlier, I talked about\nhow your perceptual spotlight\ncan either be two spotlights\nor they can merge.\nWell, similarly, human beings\ncan think about the past, surely,\nthe present, definitely, and the future.\nAnd it turns out we can\nalso split our thoughts\njust like we can split our perception\ninto two of those three things,\nso I can think about\nthe past, a past event,\nand I can think about the present.\nI can split my thinking\nand my memory in that way.\nI can also think about the\npresent and the future.\nI can also think about\nthe future and the past,\nalthough it's very difficult,\nalthough not impossible,\nto split one's thinking and memory\ninto the past, the present,\nand future simultaneously,\nnot easily done,\nbut pretty easy to split\none's attention and thinking\ninto two of those three things,\neither the past, the\npresent, and the future\nor any two of those three things, okay?\nJust like with attentional spotlighting,\nyou can place your mind, your\nthinking, and your memory,\nyour cognition onto one of those things\nand be very, very present\nor the past and the present\nand so on and so forth.\nThe default mode network,\nwhile it involves a lot\nof different brain areas,\ncan be thought of simply as\nthe network of brain areas\nthat are active when\nyour mind is wandering\nbetween these different time domains.\nAnd the paper I'd like to share with you,\nas I mentioned before,\nis now a classic paper,\nit has a wonderful title,\nwhich is A Wandering\nMind is an Unhappy Mind.\nNow, that sounds almost\nlike a news article\nor a news article about\na scientific paper,\nbut that's actually the\ntitle of the scientific paper\nwhich was published in\nthe journal, \"Science,\"\nwhich is one of the three apex journals.\nYou know, scientific\npublishing is competitive,\nbut it's especially competitive\nto get manuscripts accepted\ninto \"Science,\" into \"Nature,\"\nand into the journal \"Cell,\"\nso it represents kind of the\nSuper Bowl, NBA Championships,\nand Stanley Cup, if you will,\nfor you sports aficionados\nof scientific publishing.\nThis is a paper from Matthew\nKillingsworth and Dan Gilbert.\nIt was published in 2010,\nbut it's still considered a classic.\nAnd this paper, A Wandering\nMind is an Unhappy Mind,\nhas a number of very important points.\nI'm going to paraphrase\ncertain elements of it for you\nbecause they say essentially\nwhat I would like you to know\nfar better than I could say.\nSo first of all, they\nstarted out with a statement,\nwhich I confess I disagree with,\nwhich is, \"Unlike other animals,\nhuman beings spend a lot of time\nthinking about what is\nnot going on around them:\ncontemplating events that\nhappened in the past,\nmight happen in the future,\nor will never happen at all.\"\nI agree with their assertion\nthat human beings do that.\nThat's certainly my experience,\nalthough I must say,\nI don't think there's\nany evidence whatsoever\nthat other animals don't do it also.\nSo my apologies,\nKillingsworth and Gilbert,\nbut I'd be happy to go\ntoe-to-toe with you on that.\nI am not aware of any data\nthat prove one way or the other\nwhat other animals are thinking.\nSo let's set aside other animals,\nand let's focus on the human animal.\nNow, their point is still a very good one,\nwhich is that humans have\nthis wandering of the mind\nthat they call\nstimulus-independent thought.\nThat is, there's nothing\nhappening to create these thoughts\nor anything happening in\nthe immediate environment.\nThese thoughts are just happening\non their own internally.\nThat's the default mode network.\nThis study was important.\nIn fact, it was a landmark study\nbecause they did it right about the time\nthat smartphones became\nwidely available and in use,\nso again, 2010.\nSo they basically pinged people,\nthey contacted people on their\niPhones many times per day,\nand they did this for\nwell over 2,200 adults.\nThey had a mix of male and\nfemale people in this study.\nThe mean age was 34 years,\nbut there was a range,\nmean, of course, being average,\nbut there were a range of\ndifferent ages and so forth.\nAnd at any moment, they asked people,\n\"What are you feeling right now?\"\nAnd they also asked them,\n\"What are you doing right now?\"\nSo they were looking for\nthe match or mismatch\nbetween what people were doing\nand what they were feeling.\nThey were essentially trying to probe\nwhat people were thinking about,\nand they also addressed that.\nAnd they came up with a kind\nof a bubble chart, if you will,\nwhere the bigger the bubble,\nthe more answers came back\nabout one particular thing,\nand they assessed whether or not\npeople were happy or not in\nthat moment, or sad or not,\nwhether or not they were focused\non what they were doing or not.\nThere are a lot of bubbles in this chart,\nso I'm not going to read them all.\nBut the important points\nthat came from the data,\nand, again, this is a very large data set,\nwas that, and here\nagain, I'm paraphrasing,\nfirst, people's minds wandered frequently\nregardless of what they were doing.\nIn nearly half of the samples taken,\npeople were generally\nthinking about something else,\nexcept, it turns out,\nthere's this one little bubble\nsitting way far out on the horizon here,\npeople claimed, and I'm\ninclined to believe them,\nthat they tend to be very\nfocused on making love\nif they were making love in the moment\nwhere they were pinged on their iPhone.\nNow, why their iPhone was\nthere with them at that moment,\nI don't know.\nThat wasn't included in this\ndescription of the study.\nBut all the other activities,\ngrooming and self-care,\nlistening to the news,\nwatching television,\nrelaxing, working, et cetera, et cetera,\nduring all those activities,\npeople claimed that their\nmind wandered a lot.\nAnd then they also assessed,\nof course, their mood\nand how those people\nfelt at any given moment\ndepending on what they were doing\nand how well their mind and their emotions\nmatched what they were doing.\nAnd what they say here is second,\nthey revealed that people were less happy\nwhen their minds were wandering\nthan when they were not,\nand this was true during all activities.\nAnd then third, what people\nwere thinking at a given moment\nwas far better a predictor\nof their happiness\nthan what they were doing.\nSo this is interesting\nand I think matches a lot\nof people's experience.\nIn fact, I think as you\nhear about this study,\nmany of you will probably\njust say, \"Well, duh.\"\nI mean, if you're working\nand you don't like your work\nand you're thinking about\nsomething bad that happened,\nwell, then of course you're\nnot going to be happy.\nBut the key point of this study\nis that it did not necessarily\nhave to be the case\nthat people were thinking\nabout something unpleasant.\nIn fact, if people were working\nand they were thinking\nabout something else\nthat was pleasant, that\nalso made them feel unhappy.\nIn other words, the mismatch\nbetween being in an activity\nand having our mind elsewhere\nled people to report themselves\nas feeling more unhappy in that moment.\nAnd when you total this up,\nwhat you find is that people\nare often not present\nto what they are doing,\nand that is a great source of unhappiness,\neven if their thoughts are\nthose of happy, joyful thoughts.\nSo this is interesting\nand I think runs counter to\nwhat most of us have heard\nor have been taught,\nwhich is, you know, think good thoughts,\nyou know, try and suppress bad thoughts,\nhave a good internal landscape,\nyou know, create a good narrative.\nThat is all true, but\nequally if not more important\nis to have the ability to be fully engaged\nin what you are doing at a given moment.\nThat is the strongest\npredictor of being happy.\nAnd there were several other studies\nthat followed up on this,\nbut their conclusion that they put\nin the final short paragraph of this paper\nI think really captures it beautifully.\nThey say, and here, I'm quoting directly,\n\"In conclusion, a human\nmind is a wandering mind,\nand a wandering mind is an unhappy mind.\nThe ability to think about\nwhat is not happening\nin a moment,\" I added\nthe in a moment part,\n\"is a cognitive achievement\nthat comes at an emotional cost.\"\nSo I know I'm not alone in\nbelieving that this paper,\nA Wandering Mind is an Unhappy Mind,\nand we will provide a link to this paper\nin the show note captions,\nis absolutely key in understanding\nwhy a meditation practice is so important\nbecause a meditation practice\nis really about adjusting your place\nalong that\ninteroceptive-exteroceptive continuum\nto what you happen to be\nexperiencing in that moment.\nAnd while most people think\nof a meditative practice\nas focusing on what's going on internally\nwith your eyes closed, third eye center,\nfocusing on your breathing, et cetera,\nfor any number of minutes or\nmaybe even an hour or longer,\nthere are other forms of meditation\nin which your exteroception dominates\nand which you are actively\nfocusing on things outside\nor beyond the confines of your\nskin and internal landscape,\nand that, too, is meditation.\nAnd if we are to take the work\nof Killingsworth and Gilbert,\nthis A Wandering Mind is\nan Unhappy Mind, seriously,\nand I know a number of\nother laboratories have\nand have supported this\nresearch with their findings\nagain and again and again,\nwhat this means is that meditating\nis not necessarily a practice that we do\ndivorced from the rest of life.\nMeditation and mindfulness in particular,\nbeing present to what we\nare doing in a given moment\nis one of the essential keys\nto happiness and improved mood\neven if what we are doing is unpleasant.\nSo that brings us to a tool,\nand it's a tool that any\nand all of us can use\nwhether or not you tend to\nbe interoceptively dominant,\nright, that you tend to pay more attention\nto your bodily sensations,\nor exteroceptively dominant.\nAnd, again, if you don't know\nthe answer to that question,\nthere's a simple test that you can do.\nYou can just sit down or\nlie down, close your eyes,\nand you can ask yourself or assess\nwhether or not your\nattention tends to fleet\nto things outside of you, right,\ncars honking or going\nby, people in the room,\nor whether or not you\ntend to be able to focus\non your internal landscape\nto the exclusion of exteroception\nand attention to things\noutside the confines of your skin easily.\nNow, of course, this will\ndepend on context and situation,\neven how well rested you are, et cetera,\nbut that's exactly the point.\nThis is the sort of thing you want to do\nevery time you decide to\ndo a meditation practice.\nIn fact, I would suggest that you use this\nto determine what meditation\nyou do at any given moment.\nSo let's say you are somebody\nwho is a regular meditator\nor let's say you're somebody\nwho's never meditated\nand you'd like to develop\na meditation practice.\nI suggest that you do a test\nof whether or not you are\nmore interoceptively dominant\nor exteroceptively\ndominant in that moment.\nAgain, this is not a personality trait.\nThis is a question about where\nyou happen to be in a moment.\nSo let's say you're on a\nplane or you're in the car.\nIf you're in the car,\nplease don't close your\neyes while driving,\nthat's sort of obvious, but\ndo this in a safe way, please.\nBut stop, close your eyes,\nand assess whether or not you can access\nand focus your attention\nprimarily on your internal state\nor whether or not your\nattention and perception\ngets pulled to something\nexternal, to exteroception.\nAnd, again, that will vary\ndepending on circumstance and who you are.\nThen I suggest opening your eyes\nand trying to focus your attention\nto something external to you\nand seeing or evaluating the extent\nto which you can divorce your perception\nfrom sensations that occur\nat the level of your skin or internally.\nNow, I should say that\nthere's no technology,\nat least not that I'm aware\nof, absence of fMRI machine,\nin which case, you are\ninside an fMRI machine\nwhile you do this.\nBut unless you are in that experiment,\nand most of us aren't,\nthere's no technology that\ncan tell you, for instance,\nwhether or not you are\ninteroceptively dominant\nor exteroceptively dominant\nand whether or not the\nratio is, you know, 75 to 25\nor what have you at any given moment.\nYou have to assess this subjectively.\nHowever, if you sit down, for instance,\nand you notice that you can\nequally split your attention\nbetween internal sensations\nand external sensations\nor whether or not you find yourself\npulled into external sensations\nwhen you're trying to focus inward\nor you find yourself pulled inward\nwhen you're trying to focus outward,\nwell, that will dictate\nthe sort of meditation\nthat you perhaps ought to\nperform in that moment.\nLet me give an example\nof how you would do this.\nYou would stop in some way,\nso sit or lie down, close your eyes,\nand evaluate whether or not\nyou can essentially rule out\nor eliminate attention\nto all outside events.\nMost people won't be\nable to do that entirely,\nbut try and focus your attention,\nfor instance, on your breathing\nor the typical third eye center,\nyou know, focusing at a spot\nright behind your forehead.\nIf you feel you can do\nthat reasonably well\nto the exclusion of what's\nhappening around you,\nwell, then an important question arises.\nShould you meditate in a way\nto enhance that interoceptive awareness?\nOr rather, should you meditate in a way,\nfor instance, with your eyes open\nand your attention on a particular portion\nof the landscape you're in\nlike a tree or maybe even,\nyou know, an object or a plant\nor something else in your\nimmediate environment\nto try and cultivate\nor enhance your exteroceptive awareness?\nThat's up to you, but my bias would be one\nin which you work against\nyour default state.\nAgain, the default mode\nnetwork is where you land\non this interoceptive-exteroceptive\ncontinuum.\nIt's going to lead to more mind wandering,\nwhereas when you encourage\nor we could even say force\nyourself a little bit\nto anchor your attention\nto either inside your\nbody or outside your body,\nand you make that decision\naccording to what you\nare doing less easily,\nwell, then you are actively\ntraining up the neural circuits.\nYou are engaging\nso-called neuroplasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nYou are deliberately engaging a shift\nalong that continuum.\nTo make this crystal\nclear, what I mean is this.\nLet me give an example.\nIf I were to sit down and I\nwanted to do some meditation,\nlet's just say three\nminutes of meditation.\nThere's good evidence that even\nthree minutes of meditation\ncan be beneficial for a variety of things,\nincluding enhanced focus and\nenhanced anxiety management.\nLet's say I sit down\nand I notice that I\ncan really focus inward\non what's happening at\nthe level of my skin\nand my internal organs, and\nI can rule out everything.\nMaybe that's 'cause the room is quiet\nor maybe it's just because\nmy brain is in a state\nthat I'm particularly good\nat that at that moment\nor maybe it's just a natural ability.\nWell then I would opt for a\nthree-minute meditation practice\nin which I deliberately exterocept,\nthat I build up the circuitry\nto focus on something external to me\nbecause I want, and I think\nmost people would like,\nto have an adaptive mechanism within them\nso that they can slide\nalong that continuum\nand they don't default\nto whatever happens to be\neasiest for them in that moment.\nNow, if I were to sit down\nand try and focus on\nwhat's going on internally\nand I kept getting distracted\nby things happening outside of me,\nopening my eyes or feeling like\nI need to reach for my phone\nor paying attention to\nthe sounds in the room,\nwell, then I would actively\nengage a meditation practice,\nin this case, a three-minute\nexample but it could be longer,\nwhere I'm deliberately\ntrying to focus my perception\non events at the level of\nthe confines of my skin\nand internally.\nWhy do I say this?\nWell, you know, I love to use\nthe phrase anytime with kids,\nyou know, when they say\n\"This is really hard\nor something's challenging,\"\nor adults will say, \"That's really tough.\"\nWell, as my graduate advisor used to say,\nthat means you're learning.\nIf something were easy,\nif you can perform any\nactivity or thought, et cetera,\nwell, then there is absolutely zero reason\nfor your neural circuits to change.\nIt's the friction, it's the\nfeeling that something is hard\nthat turns on the enormous\nvariety of mechanisms\nat the level of cells, et cetera,\nthat allow you to potentially\nchange your neural circuitry.\nSo challenge and discomfort\nis the signal to your brain and body\nthat something needs to change,\nso I'm encouraging you to\nembark on meditative practices\nthat are not your default, okay?\nTo essentially go against the grain\nof where your interoceptive\nbias or your exteroceptive bias\nhappens to be at a given moment.\nAnd, again, this will change.\nFor some of you, this\nwill change across the day\nwhere early in the day,\nyou are very, very good\nat doing an\ninteroceptive-biased meditation,\nand later in the day, you aren't.\nI actually believe, based on\nthe data that I've covered,\nand we'll get into a few\nmore papers about this,\nand my lab is actively\nworking on this as well,\nthat a meditative practice can\nbe made far more effective,\nthat is, it can invoke\nmore neuroplasticity,\nmore shift in brain\nstates and brain circuitry\nif we do not take the easy path,\nthat is, we go against the grain\nof what our brain would\nnaturally do in a given moment.\nSo if you're in a crowded airport\nand you're finding that\neverything's very distracting,\nwell, then that would be a great time\nto do some interoceptive\nfocused meditation.\nWhereas if you are really in your head,\nyou know, you're looping thoughts\nabout the past and present,\nmaybe you're even in obsessive thought,\nwell, that would be a terrific\ntime, an ideal time really,\nto do a short meditation\nfocused on something external to you.\nIn both cases, whether\nor not you're focused\non interoceptive bias\nor exteroceptive bias,\nyou are going against, or I\nshould say you're pushing back\nagainst your default mode network.\nI would argue it's going\nto be far more effective,\nthat is, you're going to\nreduce or shift the activity\nof that default mode network far more\nand in a far more beneficial way\nif you actively try and suppress your bias\ntoward being more\ninteroceptive or exteroceptive.\nNow, I think that's immensely beneficial,\nboth for the immediate\nchanges that you experience,\nwhat others have called a state change,\nbecause that's what it is,\nand it also can lead to,\nas we referred to earlier,\nmore neuroplasticity, more\nchanges in the brain circuits\nthat underlie your default mode network\nand lead to what are called trait changes.\nAnd I want to be very clear\nthat I am not the first\nto make this state\nversus trait distinction.\nThat's a distinction that was raised\nin a really wonderful book.\nIn fact, I can't recommend\nthis book highly enough.\nThe book is \"Altered Traits:\nScience Reveals How Meditation\nChanges Your Mind, Brain, and Body.\"\nThis is a book by Daniel\nGoleman and Richard Davidson\nwho've done terrific\nwork and many writings\nand many TED Talks, et\ncetera, about meditation.\nI would say that circa 2016, 2017,\nthis book really captured\nwhat I believe to be the\nmost essential elements\nof the science of meditation\nand a lot of the history of it as well.\nToday, we are focusing\non much of what's covered in this book\nbut also a lot of things\nthat have happened, excuse me, since 2017.\nIn fact, most of the papers\nthat I'm going to talk about\nare papers that were published after 2017.\nBut, again, this is a wonderful book\nwhere they very clearly distinguish\nbetween state changes and trait changes,\ntrait changes being the\nmore long-lasting ones.\nMy read of this book and\nthe literature that follows\nis, again, that when you\nsit down to meditate,\nit is going to be most effective\nto do that interoceptive,\nexteroceptive bias assessment.\nAsk yourself whether or not\nyou are more in your head\nor outside your head, if you will,\nand then to do a meditation practice\nthat runs counter to\nwhere you happen to be at,\nthat is, that pushes you more externally\nif you're in your head,\nand if you're more focused on\nwhat's going on around you,\nthat pushes you more internally.\nNow, I think most people are familiar\nwith how to do an\ninteroceptive-biased meditation.\nAgain, that would be setting a timer.\nMaybe you don't have even set a timer,\nyou just sit or lie down, close your eyes,\nfocus on that third eye\ncenter behind your forehead\nor focus on your breathing\nor your bodily sensations.\nThat's typical and often discussed.\nExteroceptive based meditations,\nyou pick a focal point outside\nor beyond the confines of your skin,\nso that could be, for\ninstance, a point on the wall\nif you are indoors, it could be a plant,\nit could be a point on\nthe horizon far away.\nWhat you will find is\nthat your visual system\nwill fatigue a little bit\nwhen you concentrate your\nvisual focus at that location.\nI want to remind you\nthat it is perfectly okay\nand, in fact, necessary to blink,\nso you should blink,\nyou can relax your face,\nyou can change your expression.\nThere is no rule that says\nthat you can't do those things.\nThis is not, you know, just\nbeaming a particular location\nin space and holding your eyelids open.\nI've been accused many times\nof not blinking very often.\nThat's for other reasons.\nIt's part of the way I access memory\nabout what I want to say.\nI don't use a prompter here,\nso I'm accessing from a sort\nof internal image in my head.\nThat's how my memory works.\nBut in any case,\nif you're going to do an\nexteroceptive-biased meditation,\nthere is absolutely no reason\nwhy you wouldn't look\naway from that location\nevery once in a while\nin the same way\nthat if you were focused\non internal thoughts\nwith your eyes closed and\nfocused on your breathing,\nevery once in a while,\nyour thoughts will skip\naway from that breathing\nor from your third eye center.\nIn fact, and this is discussed\nin the book \"Altered Traits\"\nbut by many other people as well,\none of the key elements of\nany meditative practice,\nwhether or not it's\ninteroceptively focused\nor exteroceptively focused,\nis that it's really a refocusing practice.\nThe more number of times that\nyou have to yank yourself back\ninto attending or perceiving\none specific thing.\nIn other words, the more\ntimes your mind wanders\nand you bring it back,\nactually the more\neffective that practice is.\nAgain, if you can just\nfocus on one location\nwith laser precision\nand your mind never darts away from that\nand you don't have to bring it back,\nwell, then there's no neuroplasticity,\nnothing needs to change\nbecause your nervous system\nwill effectively know\nit's performing perfectly.\nSo if you're somebody who\ntries to do meditation\nand you find that your mind just wanders,\njust remember every\ntime you scruff yourself\nand pull yourself back\nto focusing on some location externally\nor focus back on your breath\nor your third eye center,\neach one of those aren't just\nopportunities to do better,\nthey are essential to\nthe improvement process.\nThink about them as ascending\na staircase of refocusing.\nEvery time you refocus, you're\ngoing up one more level,\nanother stair, another\nstair, another stair,\nand I think that will move you away\nfrom the kind of judgmental process\nof thinking, \"Ugh, like, I\ncan't focus on anything.\"\nPretty soon, what you'll notice\nis that the refocusing\nprocess will happen so quickly\nthat you don't even perceive it.\nAnd, again, this is\nsomething that's borne out\nin the neuroimaging data.\nA lot of people think that they can focus\nwith laser precision,\nbut actually, what they\nare better at doing\nis refocusing more quickly\nand consistently over time.\nThere's a classic study about this\nin very experienced meditators\nthat was done in Japan\nwhere they had people\nwith varying levels of meditation ability,\nso some who had never meditated,\nothers who were really expert meditators\nwith many hundreds if\nnot thousands of hours\nof meditation under their belt,\nand they had those\npeople listen to 20 tones\nrepeated over and over, the same tone,\nand they found that the expert meditators\ncould really focus, and they\ndid this by brain imaging,\nthey could really focus on all 20 tones,\nwhereas most people kind of attenuate\nor what's called habituate to the tone\nso that by the 10th or 11th tone,\ntheir mind is really\ngoing to something else.\nNow, that's wonderful, but\nthat really just tells us\nthe expert meditators have better focus.\nBut it turns out that the more\nmodern neuroimaging studies\nhave shown that they\ndon't have better focus\nsuch that they're staying in\na very narrow trench of focus.\nWhat they're doing is\nthey're exiting focus\nand going back in more quickly,\nmore quickly, more quickly\nover and over again.\nSo rather than think about\nyour ability to focus,\nthink about your ability to refocus,\nand the more number of\ntimes you have to refocus,\nthe better training you're getting.\nSo earlier, I mentioned doing\nthis interoceptive-biased\nor exteroceptive-biased\nmeditation for three minutes.\nWhy did I say three minutes?\nWell, three minutes seems\nlike a reasonable number\nfor most people to do\nconsistently, you know, once a day.\nAnd in fact, there are some studies\nof one-minute meditations\nand three-minute meditations\nand 10 and 60.\nMy laboratory has been studying\na 5-minute-a-day meditation,\nand that clearly has benefits,\nbut I think it's also clear\nthat by three minutes,\nmany of the benefits\nare starting to arrive.\nAnd so while I'm not pointing\nat any one particular data point here,\nit's very clear that forcing oneself\nto direct one's perception,\nthat is, your attention,\nto your internal state or\nto something external to you\nis immensely beneficial\nif you do it consistently\nand is, again, especially beneficial\nif you're focusing your attention\non the portion of your experience,\neither internal or external to you,\nthat is not the one\nthat you would default to in that moment.\nAnd some people have taken\nthis to the extreme to say\nthat, you know, you can even\njust move about your day,\nand then every once in a while,\njust do a one breath meditation.\nTo be honest, when I look\nat the whole of the data,\nit seems as if it doesn't really matter\nin order to derive most of the benefits\nof a meditation practice.\nNow, I'm a big fan of some\nof the newer meditation apps\nthat are out there.\nOne in particular that I've been using\nand that actually I started using\nbecause my dad is a big fan of it\nand he does now fairly long meditations.\nHe's doing about 10 or 20 minutes\nat least every other\nday and often every day,\nand he convinced me to\ncheck out the Waking Up app\nthat Sam Harris has put out.\nI looked at it, I think some\nof it sits behind a paywall,\nbut you can access much of\nit or at least do a trial\nand try it out without having\nto get behind that paywall.\nThey're not a sponsor of this\npodcast, I should mention,\nbut I decided to use the Waking Up app.\nI think it's terrific,\nand I think one of the\nreasons it's terrific\nis that Sam includes short descriptions\nof what meditation is doing\nand what a specific\nmeditation can do for you\njust prior to doing that meditation.\nSo those meditations can be quite brief.\nSome of them are a minute\nlong, two minutes long,\nsome are longer or even\nquite a bit longer.\nThat app, I think, includes\na variety of meditations\nthat really encompasses the\nhuge range of possibilities\nthat are possible with meditation,\nand that, at least by my\nexperience of the Waking Up app,\nhas led to my most consistent\nmeditation practice.\nAnd, of course, I would love to get Sam\non the podcast as a guest\nso we could talk about\nthe sort of underpinnings\nof the Waking Up app\nand his views on\neverything from meditation\nto, I know he's big in the discussion\nabout free will and consciousness,\nsome of the very deep and\nsomewhat abstract discussions.\nI really hope to get Sam on the podcast\nat a time not too far from now.\nMeanwhile, we've never met in person,\nbut I absolutely love\nthe Waking Up app, Sam,\nand I know my father does as well,\nand I know many of you already use it.\nIf you haven't tried it already,\nI really do encourage you to check it out.\nI want to talk just briefly\nabout this third eye center business\nbecause it turns out to\nbe pretty interesting.\nThe third eye is actually a name\nthat's been given to\nanother neural structure,\nor I should say structure\nbecause it's not strictly neural,\nand that's the pineal gland,\nand this has an interesting history.\nI promise I'm not taking\noff on a tangent here\nthat isn't relevant to meditation.\nSo you have a brain of course,\nand on both sides of your brain,\nyou tend to have mirror\nsymmetric representations\nof the same things.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, you have a prefrontal\ncortex on the right,\nyou have a prefrontal cortex on the left,\nand they actually do\nslightly different things.\nLanguage is sometimes\nlateralized to one side,\nbut in general, for every structure\nthat you have on one side of the brain,\nyou have the same structure\non the opposite side of the brain.\nThere's one clear exception to that,\nand that's the pineal gland.\nThe pineal gland is the\ngland that makes melatonin,\nwhich, at night when it gets\ndark, secretes melatonin,\nand that melatonin makes you sleepy,\nit helps you fall asleep\nbut not stay asleep.\nDescartes, right, the\nphilosopher Descartes\nasserted that the pineal\nwas the seat of the soul\nbecause it was the one\nstructure in the brain\nthat he saw was not on\nboth sides of the brain,\nit was only one of them and in the middle.\nNow, I don't know if it's\nthe seat of the soul or not,\nI'm not in a position to\nmake assessments like that.\nBut what do we know about the pineal?\nThe pineal, as I mentioned,\nis involved in releasing melatonin,\nit does a few other things as well,\nbut it is also considered the third eye\nfor a couple of reasons.\nOne is that it responds to light,\nalthough, in humans, not directly.\nSo in birds and lizards and snakes,\nthey actually either have a thin skull,\nor, believe it or not, two\nholes in the top of their skull\nthat allow light to go directly in.\nIf you look at the head of a snake,\nlight can go directly into\ntheir brain through these holes\nand activate the pineal\nto suppress melatonin\nand control their\nwakefulness, sleep rhythms.\nIn birds, they don't have\nholes in their skull,\nbut they have very thin skulls.\nAnd, believe it or not,\nlight can penetrate the thinness\nof the skull in many birds\nand communicates information\nabout time of day\nand even time of year,\nand that's translating to hormonal signals\nsuch as melatonin release from the pineal.\nAnd so the pineal has\nbeen called the third eye\nbecause it's a light-sensitive\norgan inside the brain.\nIn humans, the pineal sits\ndeep, deep, deep to the surface,\nand light cannot get in there.\nIn fact, if light can get into your brain,\nunless you are part of\na specific experiment\nwhere that's the intention\nor you're having neurosurgery\nor something of that sort,\nthen you've got serious issues happening.\nThat pineal sits deep, deep, deep\nnear what's called the fourth ventricle,\nand it absolutely should\nnot see light directly.\nSo the idea that the pineal\nis the third eye in humans is not true.\nIt just isn't true.\nSo anytime someone says, \"Oh,\nthe pineal is your third eye.\"\nThat's not the third eye center\nthat people are referring to\nwhen they talk about meditation.\nNow, you'll see a number\nof different forms of art\nwhere it will be a picture of a face\nand the eyes will be\nclosed or sometimes open,\nand there'll be literally a third eye,\nlike a cyclops eye in the\nmiddle of the forehead.\nThat has been proposed for\nmany thousands of years\nto be, quote, unquote, the\nseat of our consciousness.\nNow, that's interesting\nbecause that real estate\nbehind the forehead\nactually turns out to be\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nwhich we know from lesion\nstudies and stimulation studies,\nif you remove that brain area,\npeople become very reflexive.\nThey are not thinking intentionally,\nthey don't become deliberate.\nIn fact, and this is\nkind of an eerie result,\nbut if you inactivate, you\nturn off the prefrontal cortex\nand you give somebody the opportunity\nto play a shooting game, for instance,\ntheir accuracy goes through the roof.\nThey become essentially like a machine.\nThey see a stimulus, they shoot at it,\nthey see a stimulus, they shoot at it.\nTheir accuracy is exceptional,\nbut their ability to distinguish\nbetween enemy and friend\ncompletely disappears.\nSo they become a highly effective motor,\nor I should say sensory motor machine,\nbut their assessment and their judgment\nabout right or wrong\ncompletely disappears.\nThis is also true for people\nthat have prefrontal damage.\nThey often will have\ninappropriate behavior\nor a hard time suppressing\nbehaviors, et cetera.\nSo the third eye center\nas the seat of consciousness\nand our intention\nis something that makes sense generally\nwith what we know about the\nneuroscience and neurology,\nbut there's something more to it\nthat I think is especially\nimportant for all of you\nthat goes beyond anything\nabout ancient traditions\nor pineals or birds or snakes\nand pits in the top of the\nhead, and here's what it is.\nThe brain itself,\nmeaning the brain tissue,\ndoes not have any sensory neurons.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if I touch the top of\nmy hand, I can feel that.\nIf I want to sense my heartbeat,\nif I work at it, I can feel that.\nIf I want to sense how I feel internally\nat the level of my stomach,\nis it full, is it empty,\nam I hungry, is it acidic,\ndoes it ache or does it\nfeel pleasant, et cetera,\nI can sense that.\nAnd that's because we have sensory neurons\non our skin and in our body, et cetera.\nWe also have sensory neurons in our eyes\nthat let us perceive things externally.\nWe have no sensory neurons on our brain.\nThis is one of the reasons\nwhy you can remove the skull\nand do brain surgery on\nsomebody who's wide awake\nand be poking around in there,\nand they don't need any\nanesthetic on the brain itself.\nThey need anesthetic\nfor the incision site,\nbut they don't need\nanesthetic on the brain\nbecause it has no feeling.\nYou have emotions, but there's no feeling.\nSo normally, we are perceiving\nand paying attention\nto what we are sensing,\neither externally, sight and\nsounds, again, exteroception,\nor internally, interoception,\ntouch, et cetera.\nBut by focusing our\nperception and our attention\nnot on our bodily\nsurface like a body scan,\nbut to a point a couple\ncentimeters or inches\nbehind our forehead,\nwe essentially are\nbringing that attentional,\nthat perceptual spotlight\nto a location in which\nthere is no sensation.\nThere's nothing to feel there.\nAnd when we do that, by closing our eyes\nand focusing on that, quote,\nunquote, third eye center,\nwhich is the prefrontal\ncortex, to be quite honest,\nwhen we do that, something else happens.\nAnd what happens is when\nwe are not thinking about\nand perceiving our sensations,\nbecause there are none there,\nour thoughts and our\nemotions and our memories\nsort of mushroom up.\nA better way to put it\nwould be that they geyser up\nand take on more prominence\nin our perception.\nWhat I mean by this is that normally,\nyou know, I'm not thinking\nabout the contact point\nbetween me and this chair,\nbut as I'm speaking, I'm\nin contact with the chair\nand those neurons are firing.\nBut if I focus my energy\nand attention on them,\nthey're going to fire the same\nbut more of my perception goes there.\nSimilarly, I'm thinking things\nall the time. You are too.\nAnd I'm perceiving things all the time,\nand I'm remembering things all the time,\nand I'm anticipating things\nall the time about the future.\nBut by focusing my\nattention on the one organ\nfor which I have no sensation,\nthat is, my brain,\nwell, then thoughts,\nfeelings, and memories,\nfeelings meaning emotional feelings,\nstart to grow in their prominence\nin my awareness and in my perception.\nAnd so this is why\nwhen you sit down to\na meditative practice,\nif it's a meditative practice\nwhere you close your eyes\nor you're focused on\nthat third eye center,\nwhere you're focused on your brain\nas opposed to your bodily surface\nor something external to you,\nthe thoughts seem to come by in waves,\nand they can almost be overwhelming.\nIt's very hard to, as\nit's often described,\njust sit back and watch\nyour thoughts go by\nbecause there are so many of them.\nActually, the best way to stop thinking\nis to really focus on something external\nor to focus on sensation.\nThat's less thinking than it\nis perceiving senses, okay?\nSo I don't want this to get too abstract.\nWhen people talk about\nthe third eye center,\nthey're not talking about the pineal,\nthey're talking about prefrontal cortex,\nand when you direct your own attention\nto the very area of your\nbrain that directs attention,\nthere's nothing to sense there.\nThe only things that will\nbecome present to you\nare feelings, emotions, that is,\nthoughts and memories,\nand they will often arrive\nin what seems to be a\nvery disorganized fashion.\nAnd the reason they arrive in\nsomewhat disorganized fashion\nis because, normally,\nwe just don't perceive things that way.\nNormally, we are splitting our attention,\nour perception, that is,\nto multiple things, our\nsensation and our thoughts.\nWhen we put all of our\nperception into our thoughts,\nwe see how disorganized,\nhow wandering they are\nand how, in fact, how random\nand intrusive those can be.\nAgain, random and intrusive.\nAnd much of what we talked\nabout in that paper earlier,\nthe one where they asked people,\nwhat are you doing and\nwhat are you feeling\nand how happy or how unhappy you are,\nwhat they discovered was that most people\nare sort of in their head a lot.\nThey're not really present\nto what they're doing,\nwhich leads me to the\nstatement that I believe,\nat least based on the\ndata, that paper included,\nthat most people have\nan interoceptive bias.\nThey're focused more on\nwhat's going on internally\nthan they are focused on\nwhat's happening externally.\nThere are certainly people\nwho for the opposite is true,\nbut I think that this is an issue\nbecause we hear so often about the need\nto do a meditation practice\nthat allows us to focus inward\nand that we're getting yanked around\nby all the stressors of\nlife, et cetera, et cetera.\nAnd we are, we're getting yanked around\nby all the stressors and demands of life.\nBut as we do that,\nwe tend to be very focused\non what's happening with us.\nThe data clearly point to the fact\nthat being mindful and being aware\ncan enhance one's level\nof presence and happiness.\nBut we can go so far as to say\nthat being mindful and\naware of what's happening,\nnot just with us\nbut external to us in our\nimmediate environment,\nthat includes what other\npeople are saying and doing,\nthat also can really enhance our sense\nof well-being and happiness.\nAt least that's what the data point to.\nLet's briefly recap\nwhere we've been so far.\nWe've talked a little bit\nabout the brain networks\nthat are activated during meditation,\nwhich include prefrontal\ncortex, ACC, the insula.\nWe also talked about the difference\nbetween interoception and exteroception\nand the importance of\nassessing where you are\nalong that continuum.\nAnd I should mention, of course,\nthat you can be right in the\nmiddle of that continuum.\nYou might sit down to do meditation\nand find that you are\nsmack dab in the middle\nof being able to attend\nto things outside of you\nbut also attending to\nthings inside of you.\nIn which case, I suggest\ndoing a meditation\nthat is either exteroceptive-biased\nor interoceptive-biased.\nBut as I mentioned earlier,\nif you find that you are more,\nquote, unquote, in your head\nor in your body,\nwell, then focus on an\nexteroceptive-biased meditation\nto build up that set of circuits.\nWhereas if you are more\nexteroceptively focused\nat any given moment,\nwell, then I encourage you\nto do an interoceptively\nfocused meditation practice.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nthere is this issue of\nhow long to do a practice.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent data on these,\nbut some of the practices\nwe've covered on this podcast before\nwhen we had guests, for instance,\nhighlighted the 13-minute meditation\nthat Dr. Wendy Suzuki from New\nYork University's laboratory\nhas popularized,\nand they popularized it because\nthey have a wonderful paper\nthat we will provide a link to\nwhich shows that a daily\n13-minute meditation,\nwhich is of the traditional third eye,\ninteroceptively biased,\nfocus on breathing,\nand focus on that location\ndirectly behind one's forehead or both,\nthat meditation done daily\nfor about eight weeks,\nmaybe shorter, but in\nthat study, eight weeks,\ngreatly improved mood,\nimproved ability to sleep,\nimproved cognitive\nability and focus, memory,\na huge number of metrics were\nlooked at very specifically.\nSo that's a terrific one.\nAnd you may be asking yourself,\ndo you need to do the full 13 minutes?\nCould you get away with five\nminutes or three minutes?\nWell, my laboratory has shown\nbenefits in stress reduction,\nimprovement in sleep, et cetera,\nwith a five-minute-a-day meditation.\nHowever, in trying to establish\nhow long you should meditate,\nI would ask yourself\na couple of questions.\nFirst of all, what is a practice\nthat you can do consistently?\nAnd by consistently,\nthat doesn't necessarily mean every day.\nIf you answer the question\nabout consistency honestly,\nand you find that you can only do\none meditation session per week,\nwell, then I would encourage\nyou to go a little bit longer,\nmaybe 10 or 15 minutes,\nmaybe even 30 minutes.\nAgain, understanding that\nyou're going to have to refocus\nrepeatedly throughout that meditation\nregardless of whether\nor not you're focusing\non internal perceptions\nor external perceptions.\nIf, however, you can set aside\n5 or 10 or 15 minutes per day\nand you can meditate every day,\nwell, then I think you\nhave a bit more flexibility\nin terms of how long you meditate.\nMaybe it's three minutes one\nday, one minute the next day,\n10 minutes the next,\nand so on and so forth.\nJust like with exercise, the\nkey component is consistency,\nand this is borne out in all the data\nthat's covered in \"Altered Traits.\"\nIt's also borne out in\nall the recent studies\nthat have come out since\nthat book was published.\nConsistency is key,\nso ask yourself what\nyou can do consistently,\nand also don't necessarily burden yourself\nwith always having to do the same amount\nor duration of meditation.\nSo earlier, we decided\nwe were going to parse\nor fine slice the meditation practice,\nand indeed we've been doing that.\nWe've talked about interoceptive\nversus exteroceptive bias,\nand we've been talking about\nwhere you place your\nperception or your focus.\nAnother key component of meditation\nis the pattern of\nbreathing that you embrace.\nIn fact, the pattern of breathing\nthat you embrace during\nyour meditation practice\ncan itself be its own form of meditation.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, these days, we hear\na lot about breathwork.\nBreathwork has really grown in popularity\nin the last 5, 10 years,\nand there are a number\nof reasons for that.\nFirst of all, I think we\nneed to credit Wim Hof,\nor can we call him, I think appropriately,\nthe Great Wim Hof?\nYou know, certainly there\nwere people before Wim\nwho were doing deliberate breathwork\nand talking about deliberate breathwork,\nbut it was really about 2015 or so\nthat Wim Hof started to grow\nin recognition and popularity\nfor a particular style of breathing,\nwhich, in the laboratory, we\ncall cyclic hyperventilation.\nI know there are other names for it\nthat come from ancient traditions.\nHe named it, or people\nnamed it after him, Wim Hof.\nWim Hof, for those of you that don't know,\nis a Dutchman who is known\nto hold many world records\nfor deliberate cold exposure,\nincluding swimming under\nicebergs, longest period of time\nburied in ice up to his neck, et cetera,\nbut who's also expert\nin the use of breathing in particular ways\nin order to manage and maneuver\nthrough those challenges.\nAnd he started speaking about\ndifferent patterns of breathwork,\nin particular, the use of\ncyclic hyperventilation,\ndeep, deliberate breathing,\nso big inhales [inhales],\nexhales [exhales],\nbig inhales [inhales and exhales] exhales.\nIn the laboratory, again,\nwe call that cyclic hyperventilation.\nIt's very clear from studies\nboth done on Wim specifically\nbut on the general population as well\nby my lab and other labs\nthat that pattern of\ncyclic hyperventilation,\nof deliberately breathing\ndeeply and repetitively,\ntypically in through the\nnose, out through the mouth,\ngenerates a lot of adrenaline\nor causes adrenaline release\nfrom the brain and body.\nIt, quote, unquote, heats up the body.\nIndeed, it raises body temperature,\nbut the liberation of adrenaline\ndoes a number of things\nto shift the state of the brain and body.\nThat, more or less, is\nwhat Wim Hof breathing is,\nalthough Wim Hof breathing,\nor some people will\ncall it tummo breathing\nor cyclic hyperventilation,\nis not a pattern of breathing\ntypical of most meditations\nthat have been discussed,\nat least not in the research literature.\nNow, that's not to say that\ncyclic hyperventilation\ncan't be incorporated into\na meditation practice,\nbut Wim Hof breathing aka\ncyclic hyperventilation/tummo\nis typically considered\nits own practice, okay?\nIts own breathwork practice\ndivorced from meditation.\nIt might have a meditative component,\nbut it's not often discussed as meditation\nor as part of meditation.\nMore typically, a meditation practice\ninvolves slowing one's breathing,\nand this could be in the\nform of cyclic breathing\nof inhale, exhale, inhale,\nexhale, which is cyclic,\nor, in some cases, doubling up\non inhales and then exhaling,\nso inhale, inhale, exhale,\ninhale, inhale, exhale,\nor controlling the duration\nof inhale, breath hold,\nexhale, breath hold, repeat,\nso-called box breathing\nwhere the inhale, the hold,\nthe exhale, and the hold\nare of equivalent durations.\nAny number of different\nbreathing patterns,\nslow cyclic breathing, box breathing,\na cadence of three to six seconds in,\nholding for two seconds,\nand seven seconds out,\nregardless of what cadence\nof breathing one uses,\nthere is a tendency during\nmost meditative practices\nto slow one's breathing\nand/or control one's breathing\nin deliberate fashion.\nThis is essential because\nwhen we default our breathing,\nthat is, when we don't pay attention\nto how long we are inhaling\nrelative to our exhales,\nwhen we don't deliberately exhale,\nthat is, normally we just passively exhale\nbut we actively inhale,\nI repeat that,\nnormally, when we're not\nthinking about breathing,\nwe deliberately inhale,\nthere's a a motor command that's\nsent to inflate the lungs,\nand then we passively exhale.\nBut in many breathwork practices\nor meditation practices,\nwe actually actively exhale as well.\nWell, when we do that, a\nnumber of things happen.\nFirst of all, it forces us\ninto interoception. Why?\nBecause the diaphragm,\nthe muscle that helps\nmove the lungs essentially\nand create a specific cadence of breathing\nor depth of breathing\nas one would with box breathing\nor deliberately slow breathing,\nwell, that muscle resides inside of us,\nand so when we focus on our breathing,\nmore often than not, we aren't focused\non the actual air leaving\nour nasal passages or mouth,\nmaybe a little bit,\nbut more typically, we are forced to focus\nor we just default to focusing\non the movement of our\ndiaphragm or of our belly\nor the rising and falling of our chest.\nAll of that is to say\nthat by deliberately\nfocusing on our breathing,\nwe shift to interoception.\nSo breathing and specific\npatterns of breathing\nare sort of along for\nthe ride in meditation,\nbut the reverse can also be said,\nthat when we focus on our breathing,\nwe shift to interoception and\naway from external events.\nIt doesn't mean we can't\nstill pay attention\nto external events, we\ncan still exterocept,\nbut at least some portion\nof our perception,\nof our attention shifts to interoception.\nSo we of course need to\nbreathe to stay alive.\nWe have to breathe at least every so often\nin order to stay alive,\nso, of course, breathing is\npart of any meditative practice,\njust like it's part of any\nliving activity, even sleep.\nBut if the first component of meditation\nis to direct our perception\nin a deliberate way,\nusing that prefrontal cortex,\nto a specific location,\neither on the surface of\nor within our body or\nexternal to our body,\nor both, but typically one or the other,\nthen we can say that the second element\nof a meditative practice is\nthe pattern of breathing,\nand we can ask ourselves,\ncan it and should it be deliberate or not?\nIn other words, do we just default\nto however we happen to be breathing,\nor should it be deliberate?\nThat is, should we be controlling\nthe depth and the cadence?\nAnd I do believe that,\nbased on what we know about the capacity\nfor specific patterns of breathing\nto shift our brain state,\nthat controlling one's\npattern of breathing\nduring meditation can\nbe enormously useful,\nand that is true regardless\nof whether or not\none is focusing on interoceptive\nperceptions within our body\nor exteroceptive perceptions.\nSo that raises the question,\nhow should we breathe during meditation?\nWell, there is, again,\nno simple one-size-fits-all rule there,\nbut there are some general\nrules of respiration physiology\nthat can help us access and\ndevelop a meditation practice\nthat is going to best serve our goals.\nAnd since this is not an\nepisode all about respiration,\nand we will do one,\nI simply want to give you the basics\nof what respiration can do\nto shift your brain and body state.\nBefore I do that, however,\nI want to give a very\nspecific instruction,\nwhich is when you sit down to meditate,\nor if you're going to do\nyour meditation walking,\nthat's fine too.\nI should just say when\nyou are about to begin\nyour meditative practice,\nyou need to ask yourself a question.\nDo you want to be more relaxed\nthan you are at present,\nor do you want to be more\nalert than you are at present\nwhen you exit the meditation practice?\nDo you want to calm down,\nor do you want to become more alert?\nSimple question. You can\ndecide from session to session.\nYou could even switch within a session.\nBut just as you need to\nassess whether or not\nyou are leaning more\ninteroceptively or exteroceptively,\nyou also need to ask yourself,\ndo you need to calm down\nor want to calm down,\nor do you want to be more alert\nat the end of your meditation session?\nOr maybe you want to go into\na state of deep relaxation\nand then exit with more alertness.\nThe way to do that is very simple\nusing breathwork and specific\npatterns of breathing.\nAnd here is the general\nrule that is supported\nby all the respiration\nphysiology that I'm aware of.\nI'm oversimplifying here,\nbut I'm oversimplifying intentionally\nso you can simply apply the tool.\nAnd then, as I mentioned\nbefore, we will do an episode\nall about respiration\nphysiology in the future.\nEssentially, if your inhales\nare longer and/or more\nvigorous than your exhales,\nthen you will tend to be more alert\nor you'll shift your brain and body\ntowards a state of more alertness.\nThis is simply based on the\nway that the neural circuits\nlike the pre-Botzinger nucleus\nand the parafacial nucleus\nthat govern respiration\nphysiology and alertness,\nit's simply the way they work.\nThey communicate with brain areas\nthat release noradrenaline\nand norepinephrine, et cetera.\nIn contrast, if you\nemphasize longer duration\nand/or more vigorous exhales\nrelative to your inhales,\nyou will tend to relax more,\nyou will tend to calm your nervous system.\nNow, you might be saying,\n\"Okay, I understand what it is\nto make an inhale longer than my exhale,\nbut how do I make it more vigorous?\"\nWell, it simply means drawing\nmore air into your lungs\nmore quickly than you allow\nyourself to exhale that air.\nSo an example of inhale-biased breathwork\nwould be [inhales and exhales]\n[inhales and exhales],\nso there's an active\nemphasis on the inhale,\nand it's a little bit\nlonger than the exhale\nwhich is passive.\nConversely, if you want to relax,\nthen you want to extend your exhales\nrelative to your inhales,\nand you can even make them active exhales.\nSo it can be inhale [inhales and exhales],\nexhale [inhales and exhales].\nThat's going to shift your nervous system\nin a direction of more calm.\nAnd, of course, if you would like to stay\nat the level of alertness aka calmness\nbecause those are two sides\nof the same seesaw or the same continuum,\nif you'd like to be right where you're at\nat the end of your meditation\nas where you started,\nat least in terms of levels\nof alertness and calmness,\nwell, then you would just keep\nyour inhales and your exhales\nrelatively balanced in terms of duration.\nNow, the introduction of\nthings like breath holds\nwith box breathing or Wim Hof breathing,\ntypically, it's 25 or\n30 deep inhale, exhales,\ndeep inhale, exhales, and\nthen exhale all your air,\nhold your breath for 15 to 60 seconds,\nand then repeat and so on,\nsometimes some inhales and holds.\nWell, that's a whole business into itself.\nBut for sake of meditation,\nthe key thing to understand\nis that if you are going to do\na complicated breathing practice,\nit will, by design, by necessity,\nshift much of your attention\nto the breathing practice,\nespecially if it's not cyclic,\nif it's not inhales follow exhales.\nCyclic breathing is where\ninhales always follow exhales,\nfollow inhales, follow exhales.\nIt actually relies on\na specific brain center\ncalled the pre-Botzinger complex\ndiscovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.\nHe was a guest on this podcast previously.\nHowever, if you are\ndoubling up on your inhale,\nso two inhales [inhaling],\nand then an exhale [exhales],\na pattern of breathing\nmy laboratory has studied extensively,\nwell, then that relies on\na different brain center,\nthe parafacial nucleus.\nThe point is that if you are\nengaging in noncyclic breathing\nor you are deliberately\nemphasizing inhales or exhales\nor the vigor of inhales\nand exhales, et cetera,\nwell, then some portion of\nyour attention will be devoted\nto making sure that you follow\nthat breathing practice.\nWe are very good at going into\ncyclic breathing practices\nby default, and our attention\ncan drift to other things.\nInteroceptive or exteroceptive,\nit doesn't matter,\nwe can just drift into, you\nknow, how our body feels\nor something we see or hear\nin the room, et cetera.\nWhen we are focused on our breathing\nand the breathing pattern\nis noncyclic or complex in some way\nin that it involves\ndeliberate voluntary commands,\nagain, from those so-called\ntop-down mechanisms\nof the prefrontal cortex,\nwell, that, by design,\nrequires some portion,\noften a significant\nportion of our attention\nto be devoted to the\nbreathing practice itself.\nSo what does this mean?\nThis means that breathwork itself\ncan be a form of meditation,\nand meditation can involve breathwork,\nbut one should know that the\nmore deliberate and unnatural\nthat pattern of breathing is,\nthe less you will be able\nto focus on other things.\nNow, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\nYou can actually leverage this.\nSo for instance, if you are somebody\nwho's very much caught in your own head,\nright, we talked about this earlier,\nor you're in a moment where\nyou're really stuck in your head\nand you want to get out of your head,\nwell, then that meditation\npractice that you do\nreally should be focused\non exteroceptive bias,\nyou should really focus on\nsomething external to you,\nand I would encourage you\nto use a natural cyclic\npattern of breathing\nwhere inhales follow exhales\nfollow inhales follow exhales.\nIf, however, you are finding\nthat you're sort of\ncaught in the landscape\nof things happening around you\nand you want to ground yourself,\nas it's sometimes called...\nThat's a loose language,\nnot a scientific language.\nI know there's this practice of grounding,\nand that's a whole thing.\nPeople are always writing to me,\n\"Is grounding a real thing,\nwalking barefoot on the Earth\nand magnetic fields, you know,\nand gravitational fields?\"\nWell, gravity's real,\nbut, you know, grounding,\nthere isn't a lot of\nscience for it, to be frank.\nIt does feel nice to walk\non the ground, however.\nBut if you are somebody\nwho's kind of feeling\npulled out of yourself\na lot or in a moment\nand you want to bring your\nawareness into your body\nand sort of calm down,\nwell, then I would encourage you\nto, yes, use a deliberate,\nsomewhat unnatural\nor non-default pattern of breathing,\nwhich, by definition, will force you\nto attend to what's\ngoing on interoceptively.\nAgain, I'm not aware of any place\nthat this has been discussed\nin detail such as this before.\nIf there is a research literature on this,\nplease let me know.\nMy laboratory has been\nworking on this extensively.\nI'm always looking for new\ncolleagues and collaborators.\nWe, meaning Dr. David Spiegel\nwho's an expert in hypnosis,\nagain, who's been a guest\non the Huberman Lab podcast\nand my colleague at Stanford Psychiatry.\nIn fact, he's our associate\nchair of psychiatry,\nworld expert in hypnosis, he's\nbeen on this podcast before,\nwe have an active research\nprogram focused on these issues.\nWe are very much of the belief\nthat a breathwork practice\nitself can be meditative,\na meditation practice\ncan include breathing,\nbut the more that that meditative practice\nfocuses on the breathing itself,\nthe more interoceptive-biased it will be.\nNow, it's very important to understand\nthat an interoceptive-biased\nbreathwork practice\nwill have a specific effect,\nwhich is to make you more\ninteroceptively aware.\nAnd if you think back to\nearlier in the episode,\nfor many people, that\nwill be a wonderful thing\nand something that they\nare actively seeking\nor ought to seek\nbecause it can help people gain awareness,\nfor instance, you know,\nif they're stressed\nand they're not realizing\nit till the end of the day,\nthey're just exhausted,\nmore interoceptive\nawareness throughout the day\ncan be very beneficial.\nIf, however, you are somebody\nwho is overly focused on\nyour bodily sensations,\nwell, then more exteroception\nawareness is important.\nAnd this brings us to a yet larger theme\nbut a theme that I think really emphasizes\nwhat particular types\nof meditative practices\nare going to be best for certain people,\nespecially people who are using meditation\nto combat certain challenges,\nin particular, mood-based challenges\nor sleep-based challenges\nor focus-based challenges.\nI haven't listed off\nall the positive benefits of\nmeditation yet in this episode,\nbut they are many, many, many.\nIn fact, there are now tens of thousands\nof scientific studies\nshowing, for instance,\nthere are known benefits\nof doing meditation\nfor enhancing sleep,\nthere are known benefits of\na regular meditation practice\nfor enhancing focus,\nthere are known benefits of\na regular meditation practice\nfor reducing inflammatory cytokines,\neven improving outcomes in cancer,\nreducing pain, improving mood,\nreducing the symptoms of ADHD\nand clinically diagnosed HD\nand on and on and on.\nAnd, again, rather than focus\non all those beautiful studies today\nwhich all basically point to the fact\nthat some meditation\npractice done regularly,\neven if it's very brief,\nhas tremendous, even outsized\nbenefits on our health\neven relative to some drug\ntreatments, that's been shown.\nRather than focus on all\nthat, I've been more focused\non what sorts of brain\nand body changes occur\nwhen we do a meditation practice\nand, perhaps more importantly,\nwhat really constitutes\na meditation practice.\nWe have this thing about\na continuum of perception.\nWe also now are talking about breathing.\nWell, there's another component\nthat I'd like to raise now,\nwhich we could say is\nthe third major component\nif the first one that I raised\nwas interoceptive versus\nexteroceptive bias or continuum,\nthe second being breathing,\nis it going to be default\nor deliberate breathing?\nIs it going to be natural\ncadence or unnatural cadence?\nAgain, no right or wrong,\nit just depends on what your goal is.\nThere's a third component.\nThis is a component,\nagain, that hasn't really been\nformalized in the literature\nbut that Dr. Spiegel and I\nare working hard to formalize\nthrough some research and\nthrough an upcoming review\nthat we will provide\nlinks to once it's out,\nand that's a separate continuum\nwhich is the continuum\nbetween interoception and dissociation.\nSo now all of you know\nwhat interoception is,\nbut most people probably don't know\nor don't realize what dissociation is.\nOften we hear about dissociation,\nsometimes called disassociation.\nSome people pronounce it\ndissociation. Guess what?\nDespite being corrected many times\nfor each of those pronunciations,\nI checked with my colleagues\nwho are experts in\ndissociation or disassociation,\nand guess what?\nThey're the same thing.\nTomato, tomato, potato, potato.\nSo I'm going to say dissociation.\nSome people will say\ndisassociation, like I disassociate.\nOther people will say I dissociate, okay?\nBoth of those refer to\nessentially the same thing.\nDissociation is often talked about\nin the context of a negative event.\nAnd indeed, dissociation is unfortunately,\nor, I should say, is adaptively associated\nwith traumatic events.\nIn particular, violent or sexual\ntrauma, people will report\nfeeling out of body or\nout of the experience\nduring the experience\nor during a recollection\nof the experience.\nDissociation has also been described\nin terms of people who are\nin a traumatic accident\nor they see someone killed\nright in front of them.\nFirst responders will\ntalk about dissociating\nwhen they arrive on a scene.\nI don't want to provide, you\nknow, gruesome imagery here\n'cause I know people can be\npretty sensitive to this,\nbut, you know, showing up\non the scene of a car crash\nand just seeing carnage or\nincredible damage to bodies\nor, you know, this sort of thing.\nDissociation lies at the opposite end\nof a continuum with interoception.\nNow, earlier, I said that interoception\nis on the opposite end of a\ncontinuum with exteroception,\nbut it also is on the opposite end\nof a continuum with dissociation.\nWe can provide some\nbetter definitions perhaps\nto make this crystal clear,\nand here, I'm actually reading\nfrom an upcoming review.\nI feel comfortable reading from it\nbecause I'm an author on the review.\nBut nonetheless, interoception\nrefers to a process\nby which your nervous system,\nmeaning your brain and\nconnections with your body,\nsenses, interprets, integrates,\nand regulates signals\noriginating from within the body,\nand thereby provides a\nmoment-to-moment mapping\nof your internal landscape\nat both a conscious and unconscious level.\nOkay, that's a lot of words\nto describe basically the process\nof perceiving what's happening\nat the level of the surface\nof your skin or inward.\nDissociation can be thought of\nas the opposite of interoception.\nIt's a lack of bodily awareness\nor a removal of one's conscious experience\nfrom one's bodily\nexperience and awareness.\nAgain, this is most often talked about\nin the context of something traumatic,\nbut really, if we think about health\nand mental health and physical health,\nthe optimal place to reside\non the continuum between\ninteroception and dissociation\nis somewhere in the middle.\nWe don't want to be dissociated\nfrom life's experiences,\nbut we also don't want everything\nthat happens in the world\nto profoundly impact our\nheart rate and our breathing.\nWe'd be yanked around by every experience.\nThere are instances in\nwhich being yanked around\nor pulled into an experience\nis something that we desire and want,\nlike seeing a movie that we want to see\nor, for instance, clinical\nhypnosis or falling in love,\nwonderful experiences\nand sometimes also sad experiences, right?\nBeing able to feel one's feelings\ndepending on life's events is important.\nBut being too dissociated\nor being too feeling,\nthat is, feeling so much\nin response to everything that\nhappens is also problematic.\nThere are certain people, for\ninstance, that have challenges\nwith what's called narrative distancing.\nThat is, they see someone\nin a movie getting hit\nand they almost flinch as\nif they are getting hit.\nThey see someone who's\nscared or happy in a movie\nand they feel scared or happy\nin a way that seems like\nthey're along for the ride\na little bit too much.\nThis is important\nbecause what it speaks to\nis the ability for that...\nRemember way back at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nthat ACC, that anterior\ncingulate cortex and the insula.\nWe've got a prefrontal cortex\nthat can say, hey, let's be rational.\nThat movie, that person\nwho's happy or sad,\nthat person in your environment\nwho's breaking down crying,\nyes, they're sad, it's\nimportant to be sympathetic,\nmaybe even empathic towards them,\nbut let's not get pulled\ninto the experience\nso much that we lose ourselves.\nAnd then of course there\nare areas of your brain\nthat are also leaning on,\nand here I'm using metaphor,\nbut they're leaning on the\ninsula and ACC and saying,\nhey, there's somebody that\nI care about that's upset,\nI'm also going to be upset,\nor somebody I care about is happy,\nI'm also going to be happy,\nor they're scared so I'm\nalso going to be scared.\nSo it's a push-pull\nbetween our recognition\nthat we are each distinct entities\nand also, of course,\nthe very healthy desire\nto be attached to others' experiences\nand the experiences around us.\nSo why am I raising yet\nanother continuum, right?\nWe already have the one continuum\nof interoceptive-exteroceptive awareness.\nWell, if we want to think\nabout how meditation\ncan serve our mental health\nand our ability to focus,\nthere's a very particular mental\nmodel that we can arrive at\nthat incorporates this\ninteroceptive-dissociative continuum.\nAgain, if you are extremely interoceptive,\nyou're feeling everything in your body,\nand those feelings in your body\nnearly completely account\nfor all of your experience\nif you're at that far\nend of the continuum.\nOn the dissociative end of things,\nyou can see what's going on,\nyou can react to what's going on,\nbut your bodily response to\nthat is essentially shut down.\nYou could either be paralyzed shut down,\nso kind of no movement,\nor you could still be\nengaging in behaviors\nbut you're dissociated.\nAgain, sadly, this is often\nwhat victims of trauma report,\nthat they are able to just\ngo through the motions\nbut just shut off their emotions\nor their emotions just shut off.\nThey aren't feeling the elevated\nheart rate or breathing.\nSometimes they can even be quite scared,\nbut they're not even perspiring\nor showing any signs of autonomic arousal,\nthat is, fright or stress or panic.\nSo let's talk about this model\nof interoception and dissociation\nand then a meditative practice\nthat can be used to try and\nanchor us at the right location\nor the healthy location\nalong that continuum.\nLet's first imagine the\nideal mental health state.\nAnd here, I want to\nacknowledge, nobody achieves\nor at least maintains\nthis mental health state.\nI want you to imagine that where you are\nalong this\ninteroceptive-to-dissociative continuum\nis like a ball bearing,\nor you represent a sphere\nthat can roll back and\nforth along the continuum.\nAt one end, you have pure interoception,\nyou're just feeling everything.\nAt the other end, you're\ncompletely dissociated.\nWell, in this one\nversion of mental health,\nwe take that continuum\nand we fold up the sides\nso that it looks like a V, okay?\nOn one end, you have interoception.\nOn the other end, you have dissociation.\nI realize a number of\npeople are listening to this\nand not watching this on YouTube\nso they can't see that my hands are now,\nthe heel of my hands are together,\nthe fingers of my hands are\napart so it looks like a V,\nand you are like a ball bearing.\nYour state is like a ball\nbearing at the base of that.\nYou are in a trench\nof perfectly balanced\ninteroception and dissociation,\nso you can feel things,\nyou can register what's going\non in the outside world,\nbut your feelings are not\noverwhelmed or overtaken\nby what's happening in the outside world.\nYou are in a perfect place\nof being able to make rational decisions\nand yet still feel your feelings.\nWouldn't that be lovely?\nWouldn't that be lovely\nif we could be like that\nwhenever we wanted to?\nAnd frankly, nobody is\nlike that all the time.\nMore typically, the model\nof mental health and mood\nand well-being and perception\nof self versus others\nand internal versus external states\nis one of more of a U, a U shape,\nwhere at one end, we have interoception,\nand at the other end,\nwe have dissociation,\nand it's kind of U shaped,\nand your state is more or\nless like a ball bearing\nat the base of that U\nthat, you know, it gets\npushed from side to side.\nMaybe, you know, your\nheart races a little bit\nbecause of something bad or good,\nand that ball bearing\nshifts towards interoception\na little bit more and you notice\nthat your heart is racing.\nOr perhaps, at any given moment,\nyou know, your mind drifts a little bit\nwhile watching a movie or\nwhile talking to your partner\nor while your child is\ncomplaining about something\nand you're thinking about something else,\nand that ball bearing shifts\ntowards the dissociative\nstate a little bit.\nThat is a mild form of dissociation.\nAnd I think most people would agree\nthat being mentally healthy\nwould involve this kind\nof U-shaped model as well,\nwhere it kind of can shift back and forth,\nbut it's not extreme.\nYou're not going from interoceptive-biased\nall the way to dissociated\nin any kind of extreme way.\nThe ball bearing stays down\nnear the base of that U.\nThen, of course, there are states\nthat we all, frankly, go\ninto from time to time\nwhere the continuum of\ninteroception and dissociation\nis essentially flat,\nwhere you are a ball bearing\nat one location or another,\ndepending on whether or\nnot you're watching a movie\nthat you're very engrossed in\nor you're in a conversation with\nor in an activity with your\npartner or a friend, et cetera,\nthat has you very engrossed,\nmaybe matching their state, right?\nThere are a number of\nstates you can imagine\nwhere matching one's state\nis actually healthy and good,\nand then there are a number\nof conditions in life\nand situations in life\nwhere being matched to\nsomeone else's condition\nlike you're getting yelled at\nand they're angry so then\nyou're getting angry,\nand then pretty soon,\nyou know, you're not in the\nbest place along that continuum.\nAnd I think that for many people,\nthey find themselves somewhere\nalong that continuum.\nAnd a number of practices,\nincluding meditation,\nincluding exercise, including\ngetting a good night's sleep,\nincluding therapy, including journaling,\nincluding just doing activities\nlike social engagement that you enjoy,\nare designed to sort of bring up the edges\nof that flat continuum into\nmore of a U or concave shape\nso that that ball bearing,\nmeaning your state of awareness\nand your state of\nfeeling your own feelings\nversus paying attention to\nwhat's going on around you,\nis somewhere, again,\nbiased toward the middle.\nBy curling up the edges of\nthat continuum on either end,\nit biases that state toward the middle.\nAnd then, of course, there's the extreme\nthat I think almost everybody would agree\nis more or less pathologic,\nwhich is one in which that continuum\nis no longer shaped like\na deep trench like a V,\nit's not shaped like a U,\nit's not flat with the\nedges curled up a little bit\nor even flat.\nIt's actually now convex.\nIt looks like a mountain shape, a peak,\nand that little ball bearing at the top\ncan either drop all the way to one side\nof pure interoception,\njust feeling beyond any ability\nto pay attention to anything else,\njust feeling one's feelings,\nbeing angry, being sad,\nor even happy, right?\nBeing so extremely happy or manic\nthat you can't pay attention to the fact\nthat it's totally out of context, right,\ninappropriate for what's\ngoing on around you,\nor dropping to the other\nside of the continuum\nwhere you're so dissociated\nthat you're not engaged with\nwhat's going around you.\nYou're truly, quote, unquote, checked out.\nThat shape is one that I\nthink almost all clinicians,\nif not all clinicians,\nand most people would say is pathologic\nbecause you are either\ncompletely checked out\nor you are completely\nabsorbed in what's going on\nwithin you or around you.\nThat mental model that I just created\nis a simple mental model.\nIt is by no means exhaustive,\nbut it does incorporate a\nlot of what we think about\nwhen we think about mental health\nand we talk about the ability\nto be mentally stable,\nto feel one's feelings,\nbut to still be actively engaged\nin what's happening around us.\nAnd again, it's a continuum\nthat spans from interoceptive\nawareness to dissociation\nwhere the extremes are pathologic\nand somewhere in the middle is healthier,\nand then there are practices that bias us\ntoward being in the middle by default.\nWhat are those practices?\nWell, we know for sure\nthat being sleep deprived, for instance,\ntends to take us away\nfrom that trench shape\nor U-shape continuum\nor even flat continuum\nand starts to make that\ncontinuum more convex.\nIt tends to make us either feel\nlike we're completely\nchecked out and exhausted\nor that we are completely labile,\nwe are yanked around by whatever\nexperience is happening,\nwe are just not able to manage.\nSo sleep is, as I always say,\nthe fundamental or foundational layer\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance\nbecause it tends to put\nus in a healthier place.\nThat is, when we're getting\nenough quality sleep consistently,\nit tends to put us in the\nmiddle of that continuum.\nSleep deprivation does\nexactly the opposite.\nIt pulls us apart.\nAnd when I say pulls us\napart, that's not a real term.\nWhat it does is it tends\nto make that continuum\nless concave, right, less bowl shaped,\nand more convex, more hill shaped,\nif not a peak mountain shape\nwhere it drops us to\none side or the other.\nIn addition, a meditative\npractice done regularly,\nbecause it can allow us to\nbecome more interoceptively aware\nor it can allow us to become\nmore exteroceptively aware,\nwhich is really just another\nform of dissociation,\nagain, dissociation isn't always bad\nprovided it's not at the extreme,\na meditative practice\ncan actually teach us\nto deliberately move along this continuum.\nSo this is something, again,\nthat hasn't been discussed a\nwhole lot in the literature.\nIt's been discussed, I should say,\nin pieces in different literatures.\nIf you look in the clinical\npsychiatry literature,\nthere's a wonderful collection\nof studies and reviews\nthat will say that interoceptive\nawareness is terrific\nexcept for the person\nthat is so aware of their\ninternal functioning\nthat they are not able\nto engage in the world.\nSimilarly, you'll find\na beautiful literature,\nresearch and clinical literature,\nthat will say that\ndissociation is terrible\nin the case of trauma.\nIn fact, it can put people in positions\nof repeating a behavior over and over\nthat's damaging to them,\nbut because they can disengage\nor they're dissociated from it\nthat they continue the behavior,\nor dissociation can be very\nadaptive and beneficial\nif it allows people,\nfor instance, to create\nsome narrative distancing\nso they're not getting\npulled into every argument,\nor if someone screams at them,\nthey don't necessarily\nthink that it's their fault.\nThey are able to say, \"Hey, wait,\"\nyou know, use their\nprefrontal cortex and say,\n\"Hey, wait, like, just\nbecause you're upset\ndoes not mean that I did something wrong.\nLet's look at the evidence\nrationally.\" Okay?\nSo in thinking about the positive effects\nof meditation on mood,\nthere are two aspects that are important.\nThe first one we talked about earlier,\nwhich is being present to one's experience\ncorrelates with increased happiness.\nHaving your mind wander,\nhaving your default mode\nnetwork be one of mind wandering\nactually is correlated\nwith being more unhappy.\nThat was the earlier study\nthat we talked about,\nthat study published in \"Science.\"\nNow, of course, meditation\ncan make us more present,\nbut if we do not pay attention\nto whether or not we are\nbecoming more present\nto interoception or exteroception,\nthat is, to interoception or dissociation,\nand we don't pay attention\nto whether or not our bias\nis one of dissociation\nversus interoception,\nwe don't know where we\nare on the continuum,\nwell, then the meditation\nactually can make things\nworse, not better.\nIn other words, if you're somebody\nwho has a tremendous amount\nof interoceptive awareness,\nwell, then meditating\non your internal state\nmay not be good,\nand actually, there's some evidence\nthat it may actually be bad.\nI'll give you one little tiny example.\nI've talked about this\npreviously on the podcast,\nbut in that very study\nfrom Wendy Suzuki's lab\nshowing that 13-minute-a-day meditation\nis beneficial for focus, mood, et cetera,\nit's also very clear that\nfor a number of people\nthat do that typical third eye meditation\nfor 13 minutes a day,\nif they do that too close to sleep\nor when they want to go to sleep,\nthey have a hard time falling asleep,\nwhich makes perfect sense\nbecause they are becoming\nmore interoceptively aware,\nthey are ramping up their level of focus.\nA meditation practice\ntypically is a focus and refocus practice,\nand falling asleep involves\nturning off your thoughts and your focus\nand focusing purely on sensation,\nand then your thoughts kind of fragment\nand you drift off to sleep.\nThis is why I'm a big fan\nof using non-sleep deep\nrest or yoga nidra.\nWe will provide links\nto non-sleep deep rest\nand yoga nidra protocols.\nI've talked about them\non the podcast before,\nbut those protocols are\nnot meditation per se.\nThey tend to have people defocus,\nthey are anti-focus practices,\nwhereas meditation tends\nto be a focusing practice.\nAlong those lines, a meditation practice\nthat is one that is\nexteroceptively biased,\nwhere you focus on things\nthat are outside your body,\ncan be wonderful for somebody\nwho tends to focus too much\non their inner landscape\nand their inner narrative, et cetera,\nit can help get them out\nof their head and body,\nwhich can be very beneficial.\nBut for people that are not\nin touch with their emotions,\naren't in touch with how they feel,\nit actually can drive\nthem down the exact path\nthat's wrong for them.\nSo today's discussion is about meditation,\nand we want to make sure\nthat we are parsing\nmeditation in a rational way\nthat matches the neural circuitry involved\nand, more importantly, for\nsake of practical purposes,\nthat you are asking\nyourselves the right question.\nAre you interoceptively\nor exteroceptively biased?\nDo you tend to dissociate,\nor do you tend to sort of feel everything\nin a big way, right?\nI've heard this term of, you\nknow, hypersensitive people\nor things that sort,\nand, you know, some of\nthose are clinical terms,\nsome of them are not.\nBut you need to assess this,\nand you also need to assess\nwhere you happen to be at on a given day,\nwhich will be dictated, of\ncourse, by how well you slept,\nlife experience, et cetera.\nSo this interoceptive-to-dissociative\ncontinuum\nis one that you need to address\nprior to any meditative practice.\nAnd, again, the solution\nor the answer of what to do\nin response to your answer\nof whether or not you\nare more inward focused\nor outward focused, again, is very simple.\nJust do the opposite of\nwhere your bias lies.\nThat is, if you're tilted\ntowards interoception,\ndo an exteroceptive focused practice.\nIf you are more dissociative and you're...\nThat sounds sort of pejorative,\nit sounds bad, right?\nBut, again, if you are somebody\nwho is more focused on\nevents outside your body\nand you want to gain more\ninteroceptive awareness\nand feeling state, if you will,\nwell, then you want to do a practice\nthat's third eye center\npractice or breathing focused.\nOne of the reasons that\nmany people meditate\nis that they've heard before\nor they've experienced\nthat meditation can replace sleep\nor can reduce one's overall sleep need.\nSo that's an interesting set of questions,\nand it's one that I\ndove into the literature\nto pursue an answer to,\nand I came up with an answer\nthat was frankly a little bit\ncomplicated on the face of it\nbut boils down to some\nvery simple protocols\nthat I think any and\nall of us can leverage\nin order to sleep better\nand maybe even reduce\nthe total amount of sleep\nthat we need,\nsomething that I think\nmost people would want.\nYou know, I realize that we all\nprobably should enjoy\nsleeping, I certainly do,\nbut that it's hard to get enough sleep,\nand wouldn't it be wonderful,\nfor instance, to be able to\nget by on a little less sleep\nand still feel alert and rested?\nFirst of all, I want to\npoint to the recent study,\nand, again, this is one\nthat I've raised a few times\nand we'll post a link to it,\nentitled Brief, daily meditation\nenhances attention, memory,\nmood, and emotion regulation\nin non-experienced meditators.\nThis is the work, again, from Wendy Suzuki\nwho was a guest on the\nHuberman Lab podcast,\nwho is now the Dean of Arts and Sciences\nat New York University\nand has run a laboratory focused\non memory for a long time,\nis a terrific neuroscientist\nand researcher\nand teacher, et cetera,\nand was a terrific guest on the podcast.\nI keep returning to this paper\nbecause they used so many\nmeasures, they were very thorough,\nand the results were really interesting.\nAgain, this is the 13-minute-a-day\nguided meditation session.\nI should just mention that the\ncontrol group in this study\nlistened to a podcast for 13 minutes\nthat did not improve\nattention, memory, mood,\nemotion regulation, et cetera,\nas much as meditation did,\nwhich is not to say that\npodcasts aren't useful.\nI won't mention which podcast they used.\nFortunately, it was not\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhich I like to think at\nleast increases understanding\nof certain key concepts of\nscience and science-based tools.\nYou're welcome to look at the paper\nand see which podcast they used.\nIt's a quite well-known podcast,\nwhich is an interesting podcast,\nbut it didn't change the\nbrain in any fundamental way\nin this 13-minute session,\nwhereas 13 minutes of\ndaily meditation did.\nAnd, again, something I mentioned earlier\nbut very important to reemphasize now\nis that they mentioned\nthat if people in the experiment\nmeditated too close to bedtime,\nthey had trouble sleeping,\nagain, which makes sense\nbecause meditation, at least\nin its most common form,\nin the form used in this paper,\nis a focusing and refocusing exercise.\nFalling asleep involves focusing less.\nThere are other studies, however,\nthat have shown, or that asserted, rather,\nthat doing two 20-minute\nsessions per day of meditation\ncan reduce the need for sleep.\nThose results are debated.\nFirst of all, understanding\nwhat sleep need is\nis very individual,\nand determining what people can manage on,\nmeaning some people can manage to get by\nwith six hours of sleep but\nwould do better with eight,\nsome people would actually\nmanage probably better\nin terms of focusing and alertness\nif they slept a little bit less\nbecause they might be waking up\nmidway through a sleep cycle.\nIf you want to learn more about this,\nyou can check out any one\nof three different episodes\nthat we've done.\nOne is Master Your Sleep.\nYou can find that at hubermanlab.com.\nEverything is timestamped in that episode.\nThe other is Perfect Your Sleep.\nAnd then, of course, we've\ndone episodes on sleep\nwith expert guests like Dr.\nMatthew Walker from UC Berkeley.\nAll of those can be found at\nhubermanlab.com in all formats,\nthey're all timestamped.\nWith that said, this\nassertion that has been made\nmany times over and certainly\nin the popular press\nthat regular meditation can\nreduce one's overall sleep need\nis controversial for the following reason.\nSome groups find that\nindeed that is the case,\nand the interpretation is\nthat the stress reduction\nthat's brought about by\nregular meditative practice,\nand in this case, very regular,\nit tends to be one or, more\ntypically, two 20-minute-per-day\nmeditation sessions.\nThat's quite a lot, I\nthink, for most people.\nI mean, if you think about 40 minutes,\nisn't that much time overall,\nbut very few people will\nstick to that twice a day,\n20-minute meditation\npractice very consistently.\nWell, the idea is that\nthe stress reduction,\nwhich is clear and not debated,\nbrought about by that type\nof meditation practice\nis good at offsetting some\nof the cortisol increases\nassociated with reduced sleep\nand leading people to be able to function\ncognitively and physically\nbetter on reduced sleep\nthan they would\nhad they not been doing\nthe meditation practice.\nSo the simple way of putting this\nis that if people meditate regularly,\nthat's reducing stress.\nThe reduction in stress\nis reducing cortisol.\nAgain, cortisol is healthy,\nbut it should be restricted\nto early part of the day.\nYou don't want too many peaks in cortisol,\nespecially not late in the day.\nBy meditating, you get the healthy pattern\nof cortisol release,\nyou sort of inoculate yourself somewhat\nagainst the unhealthy\npattern of cortisol release,\nand as a consequence,\neither the sleep that people get is deeper\nand/or the total amount of\nsleep that they need is reduced.\nNow, a lot of people took that result\nand interpreted it as saying,\nwell, if you can't sleep,\nthen you can just meditate.\nSo one night, you don't sleep\nor you have trouble sleeping,\nyou just meditate the next\nday and you'll be fine.\nWell, certainly that is not\nsupported by the literature.\nHowever, there is a practice,\nand, again, it's one\nthat I've talked about\non this podcast many times before,\nbut if you haven't heard me talk about it,\nthere's a practice called yoga nidra,\nwhich literally means yoga sleep.\nIt is a practice of doing not\nso much a focused meditation,\nbut more of a body scan\nfocusing on the sensation of the body\nand actually trying to turn\noff that prefrontal cortex\nor reduce its activity.\nYoga nidra scripts can be\nfound on YouTube and elsewhere.\nThey are paralleled by a similar practice\nthat I've talked a lot about\ncalled NSDR, or non-sleep deep rest.\nI put one out into the world,\na short one that's 10 minutes long.\nYou can just simply go to YouTube\nand put in NSDR and my\nlast name, Huberman,\nand there's one there.\nAgain, all of this is\ncompletely zero-cost.\nYoga nidra and NSDR have been shown\nin a fair number of studies,\nnot as many as been done\non traditional meditation,\nor I should say third\neye centered meditation\nor mindfulness meditation,\nbut have been shown to replenish levels\nof certain neuromodulators like dopamine\nand reduce cortisol,\nreduce a stress hormone\nat least as much and, by\nmy read of the literature,\nsignificantly more than\nwith traditional meditation.\nAnd there's a nice paper\nthat we will provide a\nlink to which is entitled\nYoga nidra practice shows\nimprovement in sleep\nin patients with chronic insomnia:\nA randomized control trial.\nBasically, this study looks\nat, as the title suggests,\npeople with chronic insomnia,\nalthough the results certainly carry over\nor would carry over for people\nwho don't have insomnia.\nThe key result, I believe, in this paper,\nalthough there are many, is that, quote,\n\"Salivary cortisol reduced\nstatistically significantly\nafter yoga nidra.\"\nWhat do I mean by that?\nThere was a statistically\nsignificant reduction\nin cortisol levels, the stress hormone,\nimmediately after the yoga nidra practice\nthat we believe would be paralleled\nby a very similar if not\nequivalent practice of NSDR.\nNSDR is a lot like yoga nidra\nbut removes a lot of the kind of,\nlet's just call it the\nsort of mystical language\nand the intentions.\nIt focuses more on the\nphysiology and the body scans.\nYou know, I want to\nacknowledge that yoga nidra\nhas been around for thousands of years\nand was certainly there before NSDR.\nI also want to acknowledge that,\nand this was brought up\nalso in \"Altered Traits,\"\nthat sometimes language can be a barrier\ntoward people embracing practices.\nIn fact, this was\nrecognized by Jon Kabat-Zinn\nwhen he created what he called\nmindfulness-based stress\nreduction practices, or MBSR,\nwhich was simply mindfulness\nmeditation to reduce stress,\nbut he called it MBSR,\nmindfulness-based stress reduction,\nas a way to bring it into the clinics\nthat would otherwise perhaps be averse\nto something called\nmindfulness meditation.\nAgain, this gets more to the sociology\nand the cultural aspects\nthan it does to any specific utility\nof one practice versus another.\nHere's the takeaway point.\nIf you want to get better at\nfalling and staying asleep\nor falling back asleep\nif you wake up in the middle of the night\nor if you are generally\nchallenged with sleep issues,\nan excellent behavioral practice\nfor which there are terrific data,\nmeaning data that show that\na stress hormone, cortisol,\ncan be significantly reduced\nas well as certain\nneurotransmitters can be replenished\nas well as, and this is key\nand covered in this paper\nthat I've mentioned a few\nmoments ago on yoga nidra,\nthat the total amount\nof sleep that you need\ncan be reduced, at least somewhat,\nwell, then yoga nidra or an NSDR practice\ndone, frankly, any time of\nday is going to be beneficial.\nWhereas if your goal, I believe,\nis to increase your ability to\nfocus, to improve your mood,\nand, perhaps most importantly,\nto be able to maneuver\nyourself in a deliberate way\nalong that interoceptive-exteroceptive\nor interoceptive-dissociative continuum\nthat we've talked about so much,\nand to really shift your\ndefault mode network\nfrom one of being a mind wanderer\nto somebody who can focus\nand who frankly is happier,\nwell, then a more traditional\nthird eye center type meditation\nor a more traditional\nexteroceptive-focused meditation\nwould be beneficial.\nAgain, which one of those you\nchoose, either focusing inward\nor focusing on a point outside of you,\nagain, should be dictated\nby whether or not you tend\nto be interoceptively biased\nor exteroceptively biased.\nBut if you want to get better at sleeping,\nyou want to get better at falling asleep,\nand you want to replace\nsleep that you've lost,\nI put that in quotes\nso that my colleagues like Matthew Walker\ndon't come after me with...\nWhat would you come after me with, Matt?\nProbably with an alarm clock\nand, I don't know, blankets and a pillow\nor something of that sort.\nIn all seriousness,\nit's very clear that replacing\nsleep that we've lost\nis an area of research that's\nstill active and ongoing,\nbut NSDR and yoga nidra\nare very promising,\nif not downright useful,\nfor replacing sleep that you've lost.\nCertainly the small amount\nof data that exists now\npoint to the fact that they are,\nnot the least of which\nis a beautiful study\npublished out of Scandinavia\nshowing that a 30-minute\nyoga nidra aka NSDR practice\ncan replenish levels of dopamine,\nwhich puts people in a position\nto be more action-oriented\nand focused, et cetera,\nwhen they come out of the yoga nidra,\nso certainly a very useful practice.\nIt's a form of meditation, we\ncould call it meditation-ish,\nbut yoga nidra and NSDR\nare not typically what people think about\nwhen we talk about meditation.\nOf course, this is an\nepisode about meditation.\nThe reason I bring up yoga nidra and NSDR\nis that many people meditate\nto enhance their sleep ability\nand to reduce their total\namount of sleep need.\nIt appears that meditation is\nprobably not ideal for that\nin comparison to yoga nidra and NSDR,\nbut meditation is\nexcellent, if not superb,\nfor adjusting the default mode network\ntoward more happiness by\nbeing more mindful and present\nand for placing oneself\nin that healthy model\nof interoceptive-dissociative continuum.\nSo we've covered a lot of information,\nand I like to think that I've given you\nsome key decisions to make\nin developing a meditative practice.\nThe most important one, of course,\nbeing what will you do regularly?\nAnd maybe you're somebody who\njust answers that question\nby saying, \"Look, I'm not\ngoing to meditate regularly.\nI just want to do the thing\nthat's going to allow me to\nfeel rested when I'm tired\nand is going to allow me\nto adjust my state of mind\nwhen I'm not where I want\nto be for whatever reason,\ntoo anxious or too exhausted, et cetera.\"\nAnd for those people,\nI would say a practice\nlike NSDR or yoga nidra\nwill be immensely beneficial,\nas will a more traditional\nform of meditation.\nI also want to just remind everybody\nthat an app that guides meditation,\nalso with some information\nand some intention setting,\nsuch as the Waking Up app from Sam Harris\ncan be immensely beneficial.\nI've certainly found it to be beneficial.\nI know millions of other\npeople have as well,\nso I encourage you to check that out.\nWe've talked about\ndetermining where you are\non these continuums of\ninteroception and exteroception\nin order to dictate what particular type\nof meditation practice you\nshould do in a given moment,\nwhether or not you\nshould focus your vision\ninward with eyes closed\nor focus your vision and\nyour attention outward\nbeing a key component,\nwhether or not you should\ndo cyclic breathing,\nwhich will allow your focus\nto be off your breathing\nsomewhat easier than if you\ndo non-cyclic breathing,\nif you're doubling up\non inhales or exhales,\nwhether or not your breathing\nis going to be natural or not.\nAnd, of course, you need to determine\nwhether or not your meditation practice\nis designed to enhance your\nlevel of focus or to relax you.\nI would say that if it's designed\nto enhance your level of focus,\nthat doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it won't be relaxing.\nYou could do slow cadence breathing\nand third eye meditation,\nit could be very relaxing,\nand yet it's a focus and refocus practice,\nwhereas something like yoga nidra and NSDR\nis going to be more along the lines\nof replenishing yourself,\nreplacing sleep that you've lost,\nor maybe even reducing your sleep need.\nOn previous podcasts, I've\ntalked about hypnosis,\nand particularly the episode\nwith Dr. David Spiegel,\nour associate chair of psychiatry.\nI don't want to get into hypnosis now,\nbut just understand that\nhypnosis is distinct\nfrom breathwork, from\nyoga nidra, from NSDR,\nand from meditation\neven though it includes\nsome of those components\nlike focusing your attention,\nit involves actually directing\nyour visual attention\noutward then inward to\ngo into the hypnosis,\nit involves some breathing\nof a particular kind,\nit involves a specific imagery, et cetera.\nBut hypnosis is distinct because\nhypnosis is really designed\nto fix or address a specific problem,\nwhereas meditation, NSDR,\nyoga nidra, et cetera,\ntypically are not.\nThey can help fix problems\nsuch as anxiety, sleep issues, et cetera,\nbut they generally are not directed\ntoward a particular line of thinking.\nThey can be, but typically they are not.\nWhereas hypnosis almost always,\nespecially in the clinical\ncontext, not stage hypnosis,\nbut the clinical context for\nwhich there's a lot of research\nto show it can, for instance,\nhelp with quitting smoking,\nliterally a quadrupling\nof the effectiveness\nfor smoking cessation with\nsomething like the Reveri app\nthan if people just try and go cold turkey\nor for reducing insomnia\nor for reducing pain\nor for any number of things,\nincluding trauma, et cetera,\nhypnosis is really great at\ndealing with specific issues\nand problems and tackling those.\nMeditation tends to be\nfocused on other things,\nno pun intended.\nI'm guessing some of you\nare probably wondering where to start\nor, if you're already an avid meditator,\nwhere to go with all this information.\nFor that reason,\nI just wanted to offer you a\nparticular form of meditation\nthat incorporates all of the features\nthat I've talked about up until now\nin a single meditation practice,\nand it's a meditation practice\nthat, for lack of a\nbetter name, I called STB,\nor Space-Time Bridging.\nAnd the time component has to\ndo with a very simple fact,\nwhich is when we focus our attention,\nvisual attention or otherwise,\non things close to or within our body,\nwe tend to be fine slicing time.\nYou could sort of think of your breath\nas more or less the second hands\non your clock of existence,\nwhereas when we tend to focus\non things far away from us,\nwe tend to parse or carve\nup time within bigger bins.\nIf you've ever seen a\nairplane flying at a distance,\nit looks like it's\nmoving very, very slowly.\nIf you were right up\nnext to that airplane,\nit's probably going 500\nor 600 miles an hour,\nit would go by very quickly.\nThis is not a coincidence.\nBelieve it or not, how\nyou slice the time domain\nof your life and your experience\nhas everything to do with your vision,\nand the closer things are,\nthe more finely you slice up time.\nThe more closely your attention\nis placed on yourself,\nthe more closely you slice up time.\nIf you focus your visual\nattention very far\nor you think about the other side\nof the world, for instance,\nand you envision that,\nwell, then you're actually\nslicing time more broadly.\nHopefully that makes sense.\nFine slicing would be like\nslow motion, higher frame rate.\nLooking in the distance,\nyou're actually taking bigger time bins.\nSo even though things look like\nthey're moving more slowly,\nit's because your fidelity,\nyour precision of measuring\ntime is actually not as good.\nIt's as if you only have\nthe hours hand on the clock\nso it seems like it moves very slowly.\nHopefully that makes sense to you.\nSo there's a meditation practice\nthat I call Space-Time Bridging\nthat incorporates everything\nthat I've talked about today.\nIt balances interoception\nand exteroception,\nit balances interoception\nand dissociation,\nand it crosses the various time domains\nthat the brain can encompass using vision.\nAnd it's a very simple meditation,\nit's one that I've been doing for years,\nand it's one that we're\nstarting to do some research on,\nbut I'm just going to share with you\nbecause I think it's actually quite fun\nand can be quite informative.\nIn fact, people have told me\nthat it can even lead to\nsome interesting insights\nboth during the meditation\nand outside the meditation.\nIt's very simple, what you do,\nideally you would do this\noutside or at a window,\nbut what you do is you\nessentially close your eyes.\nI'm not going to do this now,\nI'm not going to close my\neyes and do the meditation,\nbut I'll describe it.\nYou close your eyes and\nyou focus your attention\neither on your third eye\ncenter or your breathing,\nand you try and put 100% of\nyour perceptual awareness\nonto your breathing or\nyour third eye center\nfor the duration of three breaths, okay?\nSo you're 100% or trying to\nbe 100% in interoception.\nThen you open your eyes,\nyou focus on the surface\nof your body someplace.\nI find that holding out my\nhand at sort of arm's distance\nand focusing on the palm of my hand\nand focusing there visually,\nso I'm splitting my attention\nnow between my hand,\nand I'm also going to pay\nattention to my breath\nfor the duration of three\nfull inhales and exhales\nwhile also focusing on my hand,\nso you're splitting\ninteroception and exteroception\nas best you can, about 50/50.\nThen you subsequently\nlook at some location\nin your immediate environment,\nmaybe 10, 15 feet away,\nand you focus your\nattention on that location\nwhile also splitting your attention\nso that you're still paying\nattention to your breathing,\nyou do that for the\nduration of three breaths,\nbut now you are in\nexteroception and interoception.\nThen you focus your attention\nat some distance further away,\nmaybe the furthest distance you can see.\nNow, this is why it's\nuseful to do out of a window\nor on a balcony or outdoors.\nYou focus on the furthest\npoint, maybe a horizon,\nsome furthest point for the\nduration of three breaths\nwhile also paying attention\nto your breathing,\nand sort of imagine a\nbridge between the two\nif you find it to be\nchallenging to focus on both.\nAnd then, and this is where\nit can be a little tricky,\nbut then what you actually\nfocus on is the fact,\nand this is not an imaginary thing,\nthis is a fact that you are a tiny spec\non this big ball that's\nfloating out in space, right?\nThe Earth that's floating out in space.\nAnd you try and focus\non your three breaths\nwhile also acknowledging\nthat you are a small body, literally,\non this very seemingly\nlarge body, the Earth,\nbut that's floating in\na much larger, larger,\nexpansive place, the universe,\nand you do that for three breaths.\nAnd then you close your eyes\nand you go right back into interoception,\nand you do that for three breaths.\nYou focus on your interoception\nfor three breaths.\nAnd you might want to march\nthrough these different locations\na few times or back and forth if you like,\nbut typically, I will\njust do it for one segment\nat pure interoception,\npalm of hand, some distance\nin front of me, horizon,\nwhole globe, universe thing,\nback into body, et cetera.\nWhy is this useful? Why\nwould this be useful?\nIs it at all interesting, or\nis this just some crazy idea?\nWell, the reason it's useful, I believe,\nis that it has you deliberately\nstep your awareness,\nyour perception through every position\nalong that\ninteroceptive-exteroceptive continuum.\nNow, I did say to remain connected to,\nas they'll say in the yoga classes,\naware of, I guess would be\nthe more scientific way to state it,\naware of one's breath,\nbut if you wanted,\nyou could actually try\nand put your awareness\ncompletely outside yourself,\nbut most people will find\nthat challenging to do\nif they're already paying\nattention to their breath.\nIt's just hard to do,\nso I find it easier to\njust split my awareness\nfrom interoception to exteroception.\nBut by stepping through\nthese different locations\nand then deliberately\nplacing your perception,\nyour awareness back\ninto pure interoception,\nwhat you do is you essentially\nare practicing or exercising\nthis incredible ability\nthat the human mind has\nto deliberately place your\nperception at specific locations\nalong the interoceptive-exteroceptive\ncontinuum.\nAnd I think this is very useful\nbecause many of us, including myself,\ntend to get locked at one\nlocation along that continuum.\nFor instance, if you're\nscrolling your phone\nfor a long period of time,\nyou may forget about\nyour bodily sensations,\nbut you generally forget\nabout other things\ngoing on in the world.\nOr if you're very focused\non things out in the world,\nyou oftentimes can forget\nabout your internal sensations\nand what's going on internally.\nAnd being functional in work,\nin life, in relationship,\nand in all aspects, including\nyour ability to fall asleep,\ninvolves stepping yourself\nalong these different locations,\nwhich, again, are not\njust physical locations\nof third eye center or your breathing\nor your hand or horizon.\nThose are just stations within space.\nBut remember, each one of those,\njust by way of how your visual\nsystem and the time domain\nare interlocked with one another,\nsets your mind in a\nparticular time domain.\nAnd so much of what involves\nbeing a functional human being\ninvolves dynamically\nadjusting our attention\nfrom what we are doing on our computer\nto a question somebody\nasks and then back again,\nor from text messaging\nto listening to a lecture or a podcast\nor from listening to a lecture or podcast\nand then going back into\na mode of commuting,\nbut making that commute either relaxing\nor maybe do work on your commute\nor connect with family\nor friends, et cetera.\nSo much of the fatigue of life\nand the, I should say,\nthe maladaptive behaviors\nand emotions that show up in life\nare really not about any\nset of behaviors or emotions\nbeing wrong or right,\nbut rather inappropriately matched\nto the space-time domain that we're in,\nwhich, again, is just fancy nerd speak\nfor saying being present and being mindful\nis a wonderful byproduct\nof a meditation practice,\nbut it is but one of those stations\nalong that space-time continuum.\nThe key element here is to step yourself\nthrough a practice deliberately\nso that you are flexibly\nand dynamically able\nto engage in conversation,\nthen disengage and focus,\nor focus and then disengage\nfrom the work you're focusing on\nand actually have a\nconversation or be in the world\nand move out of that\ninteroceptive awareness\nto one in which you\nare dynamically engaged\nwith the things around you.\nI realize this might\nsound a little bit vague.\nFor that reason,\nI encourage you not to\nthink about it too much,\nbut rather to try the practice,\nsee if it works for you.\nIf it doesn't, that's fine.\nI think it is a good one for people\nthat find that a third eye center\nor breathing-focused\ninteroceptive meditation\nmight be enjoyable to them\nor very beneficial to them,\nbut they might want to try something new,\nand other people who might find\nthat that tends to put them\ntoo much in their own head.\nI think it also ought to\nbe very useful for people\nthat tend to be overly exteroceptive,\nmore on the dissociative\nend of the continuum,\nand need to bring in a bit more\nof interoceptive awareness,\nbut either can't do that or\nare uncomfortable doing that\nbecause they're simply not interested in\nor comfortable with feeling so\nmuch of their internal state\nbecause that can either be overwhelming\nor that's just simply not\nthe way they want to feel.\nNow, as we round up, I\ndo want to acknowledge\nthat there are an enormous\nnumber of rooms within the house,\nor rather, I should say,\nwithin the castle that is meditation,\nincluding, for instance,\nintention setting and mantras\nand an enormous number\nof different features\nof meditation practices\nthat we simply did not\nhave time to go into\nand/or for which the research on\nis not completely ironed out yet.\nAnd for that reason,\nin future episodes in not long from now,\nI'm going to be sitting down\nwith experts in meditation\nthat include neuroscientists\nand clinicians,\nbut other experts in meditation\nthat certainly are versed in those topics,\nand where they can't point\nto specific research studies\ncan certainly point us\ntoward the utility of things\nlike mantras and intentions as they relate\nto getting the most out\nof a meditative practice,\nso I eagerly await those conversations,\nand I hope you will join\nme for those as well.\nIf you're learning from and\nare enjoying
