    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Eddie Chang.\nDr. Eddie Chang is the chair\nof the neurosurgery department\nat the University of\nCalifornia at San Francisco.\nDr. Chang's clinical group\nfocuses on the treatment\nof movement disorders including epilepsy.\nHe is also a world expert\nin the treatment of speech disorders\nand relieving paralysis\nthat prevents speech\nand other forms of\nmovement and communication.\nIndeed, his laboratory is\ncredited with discovering ways\nto allow people who have\nfully locked-in syndrome,\nthat is, who cannot speak or move,\nto communicate through\ncomputers and AI devices\nin order to be able to speak\nto others in their world\nand understand what\nothers are saying to them.\nIt is a truly remarkable\nachievement that we discuss today,\nin addition to his discoveries\nabout critical periods,\nwhich are periods of\ntime during one's life\nwhen one can learn things,\nin particular, languages,\nwith great ease as\nopposed to later in life,\nand we talk about the basis of things\nlike bilingualism and trilingualism.\nWe talk about how the\nbrain controls movement\nof the very muscles that\nallow for speech and language\nand how those can be modified over time.\nWe also talk about stutter,\nand we talk about a number of\naspects of speech and language\nthat give insight into\nnot just how we create\nthis incredible thing called speech\nor how we understand speech and language,\nbut how the brain works more generally.\nDr. Chang is also one of the world leaders\nin bioengineering,\nthat is, the creation of\ndevices that allow the brain\nto function at supraphysiological levels\nand that can allow people\nwith various syndromes and disorders\nto overcome their deficits.\nSo if you are somebody who is interested\nin how the brain works normally,\nhow it breaks down and\nhow it can be repaired,\nand if you are interested\nin speech and language,\nreading and comprehension\nof information of any kind,\ntoday's episode ought to\ninclude some information\nof deep interest to you.\nDr. Chang is indeed the top of his field\nin terms of understanding these issues\nof how the brain encodes\nspeech and language\nand creates speech and language\nand, as I mentioned, movement\ndisorders and epilepsy.\nWe even talk about things\nsuch as the ketogenic diet,\nthe future of companies like Neuralink,\nwhich are interested in bioengineering\nand augmenting the human\nbrain, and much more.\nOne thing that I would like\nto note is that in addition\nto being a world-class\nneuroscience researcher\nand world-class clinician, neurosurgeon,\nand chair of neurosurgery,\nDr. Eddie Chang has also\nbeen a close, personal friend\nof mine since we were nine years old.\nWe attended elementary school together,\nand we actually had a science club\nwhen we were nine years old\nfocused on a very particular topic.\nYou'll have to listen\nin to today's episode\nto discover what that topic was\nand what membership to that club required.\nThat aside, Dr. Chang\nis an absolute phenom\nwith respect to his scientific prowess,\nthat is, both his research\nand his clinical abilities,\nand he's one of these rare individuals\nthat, whenever he opens\nhis mouth, we learn.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero-cost-to-consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Levels.\nLevels is a program\nthat helps you see how different\nfoods affect your health\nby giving you real-time\nfeedback on your diet\nusing a continuous glucose monitor.\nI started using Levels about one year ago.\nThe Levels monitor allowed\nme to see how different foods\nchange my blood sugar level\nor my blood glucose level.\nThis turns out to be immensely important\nfor being able to predict how,\nfor instance, certain foods\nwill affect your energy level,\nyour ability to exercise,\nyour ability to recover from exercise,\nand how it will affect other hormones\nlike testosterone, estrogen,\nthyroid hormone, and so forth.\nThe other thing about\nusing a Levels monitor\nis that it gave me insight\ninto how food and exercise\nand other activities and\neven how well I was sleeping\nor how poorly I might\nhappen to be sleeping\nimpact my blood glucose levels.\nIt even taught me that the sauna,\nthat generating a lot of heat in my body,\nwas changing my blood glucose levels,\nwhich turned out to inform\nhow I should shift my eating\npatterns, foods I should eat,\ntiming of eat, and so on and so forth.\nIt really gave me great insight\ninto how all the important\naspects of my health\nwere interlocking and\naffecting one another,\nnot just how food was\nimpacting my blood glucose.\nSo if you're interested in\nlearning more about Levels\nand trying a continuous\nglucose monitor yourself,\nyou can go to levels.link/huberman.\nThat's levels.link/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nwith cooling, heating, and\nsleep tracking capacity.\nI started sleeping on an\nEight Sleep mattress cover\na few months ago, and\nit is simply incredible.\nIn fact, I don't even\nlike traveling anymore\nbecause they don't have\nEight Sleep mattress covers\nin hotels and Airbnbs.\nOne of the reasons\nI love my Eight Sleep mattress\ncover so much is that,\nas you might have heard before\non this podcast or elsewhere,\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep,\nyou need your body temperature to drop\nby about one to three degrees,\nand I tend to run warm at night,\nwhich makes it hard to sleep\nand sometimes wakes me up\nin the middle of the night.\nWhen you sleep on an Eight\nSleep mattress cover,\nyou can program the temperature\nof that mattress cover\nfor specific times in the early, middle,\nand late part of your night\nso that the mattress stays cool,\nand as a consequence, you\nsleep very, very deeply.\nIt also tracks your sleep,\nso it's paying attention to\nhow many times you're moving,\nhow deep your sleep is, it\ngives you a sleep score,\nall wonderful data to help\nyou enhance your sleep.\nAnd of course, sleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance,\nwhich makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool\nfor enhancing not just your sleep\nbut all aspects of your life really.\nIf you're interested\nin trying the Eight Sleep mattress cover,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman\nto check out the Pod 3 cover,\nand you can save $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nto the USA, to Canada, the UK,\nand select countries in\nthe EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's eightsleep.com/huberman\nto save $150 at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed with\na quality blood test.\nOne problem with a lot of DNA tests\nand blood tests, however,\nis you get data back about\nlevels of metabolic factors,\nlevels of hormones, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes interpreting your data\nand knowing what to do\nabout it exceedingly easy.\nThey have a personalized platform\nwhere you can go and\nyou can see those levels\nof hormones, metabolic\nfactors, lipids, et cetera,\nand they point to specific\nnutritional tools,\nbehavioral tools,\nsupplement-based tools, et cetera,\nthat can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to

Supplements.\nTo find the supplements we discuss\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou can go to livemomentous,\nspelled O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just mention\nthat the library of those supplements\nis constantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Eddie Chang.\nEddie, welcome.\n- Hi. Hi, Andrew.\n- Great to be here with you.\nThis has been a long time coming.\nJust to come clean,\nwe've known each other since\nwe were nine years old.\n- Yeah.\n- But then there was a long gap\nin which we didn't talk to one another.\nI heard things about you,\nand, presumably, you heard\na thing or two about me,\nfor better or for worse.\n[Eddie laughs]\nAnd then we reconnected years later\nwhen I was a PhD student and\nyou were a medical student.\nWe literally ran into each other\nin the halls of the University\nof California San Francisco\nwhere you're now the\nchair of neurosurgery,\nso it all comes full circle.\nWhen you were at UCSF, you were\nworking with Mike Merzenich,\nand I know that name\nmight not be familiar to a lot of people,\nbut he's sort of synonymous\nwith neuroplasticity,\nthe ability of the\nbrain and nervous system\nto change in response to experience.\nSo for our listeners,\nI would just love for you\nto give a brief overview\nof what you were doing at that time\nbecause I find that work so fascinating,\nand it really points to some\nof the things that can promote\nand maybe hinder our\nbrain's ability to change.\n- Oh, wow. That's fantastic.\nSo we did bump into each other\nserendipitously back then,\nand, at the time, I was\na medical student at UCSF\nstudying with Mike Merzenich.\nIn particular, I was studying\nhow the brain organizes\nwhen you have patterns of sound.\nAnd in particular, we were\nstudying the brain of rodents\nand trying to understand\nhow different sound patterns\norganize the frequency representation\nfrom low to middle to high frequency maps\nin the brains of baby rodents.\nAnd one of the things that\nI was very interested in\nwas trying to understand\nhow the patterns of the\nnatural environment,\nlet's say the vocalizations\nof the environment\nthat the rat pups were raised in,\nor just the natural sounds that they hear,\nhow that shapes the\nstructure of the brain.\nAnd one of the things we\ndid was to try an experiment\nwhere we raised some of these\nrat pups in white noise,\ncontinuous white noise that\nwas essentially masking\nall of those environmental sounds.\n- And what was the consequence\nof animals being raised\nin white noise environment?\n- Well, one of the things\nthat we didn't expect\nbut we found, which was quite striking,\nis that there's this early\nperiod in brain development\nwhere we're very susceptible\nto the patterns that we hear or see.\nIn neuroscience, we call\nthis a critical period\nor a sensitive period.\nAnd we have this for our eyes,\nbut we also have it for our ears.\nAnd one of the most\nstriking examples of this\nis that any human can\nessentially grow up in a culture\nwhere they hear different speech sounds\nfrom one language to another,\nand it's like after a couple of years,\nyou lose sensitivity to sounds\nthat are not part of your native language\nand you have high sensitivity\nfor the languages of your native culture.\nAnd that's pretty extraordinary\nthat human brain has that flexibility\nyet, at the same time, has that\nspecialization for language.\nAnd so we were trying to think\nabout how do we model this,\nfor example, in rodents,\nwho obviously don't speak,\nbut we're just understanding how sounds\nand environmental sounds\nmodulate and organize the auditory cortex.\nAnd one of the things that we\nfound that was quite striking\nwas that if you basically\nmask environmental sounds\nfrom these rat pups,\nthe critical period,\nthis sensitive period where\nit's open to plasticity,\nit's open to change, it's\nopen to reorganization,\nthat window can stay\nopen much, much longer.\nAnd in one way, it sounds\nlike that's a good thing,\nbut on the other hand,\nit's also a retardation.\nIt actually slowed the maturation\nof the auditory cortex.\nIt was ready to close when these\nrat pups were really young,\nbut by raising them in white noise,\nwe found out that you could keep it open\nfor months beyond the time\nperiod that it normally closes.\nAnd so I think one of\nthe things it taught me\nwas that it's not just about\nthe genetic programming\nthat specifies some of\nthis sensitive period,\nbut it's also a little\nbit about the nature\nof the sounds that we hear\nthat help keep that window\nfor the critical period\nopen and closed.\n- That's fascinating.\nAnd I know it's difficult\nto make a direct leap\nfrom animal research to human research,\nbut if we could speculate a little bit,\nI can imagine that some\npeople grow up in homes\nwhere there's a lot of shouting\nand a lot of inflection,\nmaybe people are very verbose.\nMaybe others grow up in a home\nwhere it's quieter and more peaceful.\nSome people are going\nto grow up in cities.\nI just came back from New York City,\nit's like all night long,\nthere's honking and sirens\nand it's just nonstop,\nand then I return here where\nit's quite quiet at night.\nCan we imagine that the human brain\nis going to be shaped differently\ndepending on whether or not one grows up\nin one environment or another?\nAnd would that impact their tendency\nto speak in a certain way as\nwell as hear in a certain way?\nWhat do we know about that?\n- Well, I think that, from my perspective,\nit's really clear that those\nsounds that we are exposed to\nfrom the very earliest time,\neven in utero, in the womb,\nwhere the sound is hearing the\nmother or father or friends\nwhile in the womb\nactually will influence\nhow these things organize.\nAnd so there's no question\nthat the sounds that we hear\nare going to have some influence,\nand those sounds are going to structure\nthe way that those neural\nnetworks actually lay down\nand will forever influence\nhow you hear sounds,\nand speech and language\nis probably one of the most\nprofound examples of that.\n- I get a lot of questions\nabout the use of white noise during sleep.\nIn particular, people want to know\nwhether or not using a white noise machine\nor a machine or a program\nthat makes the sound\nof waves, for instance,\nif it assists their infant in sleeping,\nis it going to be bad for them\nbecause it's flooding the auditory system\nwith a bunch of essentially white noise\nor disorganized noise?\nDo we have an answer to that question?\n- Not yet.\nI think that what you're asking\nis a really important question\nbecause parents are using\nwhite noise generators\nalmost universally now,\nand for good reasons.\nYou know, it is hard to\nhave kids up at night.\nI've got three kids of my\nown and was very tempted\nto think about how to\nuse some of these tools\nto just soothe them and get them to bed,\nespecially when I was, like,\nso tired and exhausted.\nBut I think that there is a cost,\nyou know, to think a little bit about.\nYou know, we're not exposed\nto continuous white noise naturally.\nThere is a value to having\nreally salient, structured sounds\nthat are part of our natural environment\nto actually have the\nbrain develop normally.\nSo whether or not that has an impact,\nyou know, while you're\nsleeping, it's not clear.\nI don't think that those\nstudies have been done.\nWhat was really clear was that\nif you raise these baby rats\nin continuous white noise, not super loud,\nbut just enough to mask\nthe environmental sounds\nthat that was enough to keep,\nyou know, the auditory cortex,\nthe part of the brain that hears,\nin this really delayed state\nwhich could essentially\nslow down the development\nand maturation of the brain.\n- And one could probably assume\nthat slowing the maturation\nof areas of the brain\nthat are responsible for hearing\nmight, I want to underscore,\nmight impact one's\nability to speak, right?\nBecause isn't it the case\nthat if people can't hear,\nthey actually have a\nharder time enunciating\nin a particular way, is that right?\nIf I were to not be able\nto hear my own voice,\nwould my speech patterns change?\n- Well, I think part of it\nis that, over time, we develop sensitivity\nto the very specific speech\nsounds in a given language,\nand the sensitivity improves\nas we hear more and more and more of it.\nAnd then on the other hand,\nwe lose sensitivity to other\nspeech sounds at the same time.\nBut as part of that process,\nwe also have a selectivity, a gain,\na specialization even for those sounds,\neven relative to noise,\nnoisy backgrounds and things like that.\nI tend to think about it\nlike what is the signal-to-noise ratio?\nAnd so the brain has its own ways\nof trying to increase\nthat signal-to-noise ratio\nin order to make it more clear.\nPart of that is how we hear\nand how it lays down a foundation\nfor that signal-to-noise ratio,\nand so you can imagine a child\nthat's raised continuously in white noise\nwould be really deprived\nof those kind of sounds\nthat are really necessary\nfor it to develop properly.\nSo I think with regard to\nthose tools for babies,\nI think we should study it,\nwe should try to understand\nthis definitively.\nI think what we saw in rodents\nwould tell us that there is potential,\nyou know, things that we\nshould be concerned about.\nBut, again, it's not really clear,\nif you're just using at night,\nwhether it has those effects.\n- I guess the critical question\nthat a number of people\nare going to be asking\nis did you decide to use a\nwhite noise machine or not\nto help keep any of your\nthree children asleep?\n- Well, I think the short answer is no.\nI mean, I obviously did\na lot of work thinking\nand work on this and\nthought about it carefully,\nbut there are other kinds of noise,\nor, I wouldn't even call it noise,\nother sounds that you can use\nthat can be equally soothing to a baby.\nIt's just that white\nnoise has no structure,\nand what it's doing\nis essentially masking out\nall of the natural sounds.\nAnd I think the goal\nshould really be about\nhow do we replace that\nwith other more natural sounds\nthat structure the brain\nin the way that we want\nto be more healthy.\n- Well, I know that\nafter you finished your medical training,\nyou went on to, of course,\nspecialize in neurosurgery.\nAnd last I checked, you\nspend most of your days\neither running your\nlaboratory or in the clinic\nor running the department,\nand your clinical work\nand your laboratory work\ninvolves often removing\npieces of the skull of humans\nand going in and either removing things\nor stimulating neurons,\ntreating various ailments\nof different kinds,\nbut your main focus these days, of course,\nis the neurobiology of\nspeech and language.\nAnd so for those that aren't familiar,\ncould you please distinguish\nfor us speech versus language\nin terms of whether or not\ndifferent brain areas control them?\nAnd I know that there's a lot of interest\nin how speech and language and hearing\nall relate to one another.\nAnd then we'll talk a bit\nabout, for instance, emotions\nand how facial expressions\ncould play into this,\nor hand gestures, et cetera.\nBut for the uninformed person,\nand for me, to be quite direct,\nwhat are the brain areas that\ncontrol speech and language?\nWhat are they really,\nand especially in humans,\nhow are they different?\nI mean, we have such\nsophisticated language\ncompared to a number of other species.\nWhat does all this landscape\nlook like in there?\n- Yeah, well, that's a\nfascinating question,\nand I'm going to just try to\nconnect a couple of the dots here,\nwhich is that in that earlier\nwork during medical school,\nI was doing a lot of what\nwe call neurophysiology,\nputting electrodes into\nthe auditory cortex\nand understanding how the\nbrain responds to sounds,\nand that's how we actually\nmapped out these things\nabout the sensitivity\nto sensitive periods.\nThat experience with Mike Merzenich\nand thinking about how plasticity\nis regulated in the brain\nand particular about how sound\nis represented by brain activity\nwas something that, you know,\nwas really formative for me.\nAnd because I was a medical student\nand was going back to my medical studies,\nit was that in combination\nwith seeing some awake brain surgeries\nthat our department is\nreally well known for.\nOne of my mentors, Mitch Berger,\nreally pioneered these methods\nfor taking care of\npatients with brain tumor\nand be able to do these surgeries safely\nby keeping patients awake\nand by mapping out language.\n- So they're talking and listening,\nand you're essentially in\nconversation with these patients\nwhile there's a portion\nof their skull removed,\nand you are stimulating\nor, in some cases, removing\nareas of their brain,\nis that right?\n- That's exactly right, and\nthe only thing off there\nis it's not essentially, it is just that.\nThe only difference\nbetween the conversation\nthat I might have with my patient\nwho's undergoing awake brain surgery\nis that I can't see their face\nand they can't see my face.\nWe actually have a sterile drape\nthat actually separates\nthe operating field,\nand they're looking and interacting\nwith our neuropsychologist,\nbut I can talk to them\nand they can hear my voice\nand vice versa.\nAnd it's a really, really important way\nof how we can protect some of those areas\nthat are really critical for language,\nat the same time, accomplish a mission\nof getting the seizures under control\nor getting a brain tumor removed.\n- And is that because occasionally\nyou'll encounter a brain area,\nmaybe you're stimulating\nor considering removing that brain area,\nand suddenly a patient\nwill start stuttering\nor will have a hard time\nformulating a sentence?\nIs that essentially\nwhat you're looking for?\nYou're looking for regions\nin which it is okay or not okay to probe?\n- Exactly, so the first thing that we do\nis that we use a small\nelectrical stimulator\nto probe different parts of the areas\nthat we think might be related\nand important for language\nor talking or even movements\nof your arm and leg.\nThat's what we call brain mapping.\nAnd we use a small electrical current\nthat's delivered through a probe\nthat we can just put at each spot.\nAnd the areas that we're\nreally interested in\nare, of course, the areas\nthat are right around the part\nthat is pathological,\nthe part that's injured,\nor the part that has a brain\ntumor that we want to remove,\nso we can apply that probe\nand transiently, meaning\ntemporarily, activate it.\nSo if you're stimulating\nthe part of the brain\nthat controls the hand, the\nhand will move, it will jerk.\nSometimes a fist will be\nmade, something like that.\nOther times, while someone is counting\nor just saying the days of the week,\nyou can stimulate in a different area\nthat stops their speech altogether.\nThat's what we call speech arrest.\nOr if someone is looking at pictures\nand they're describing the pictures\nand you stimulate in a particular area,\nthey stop speaking or the\nwords start coming out slurred\nor they can't remember\nthe name of the object\nthat they're seeing in the picture.\nThese are all things that we're\nlistening really carefully\nwhile we apply that focal stimulation.\nThat's what we call brain mapping.\n- What are some of the more surprising,\nor maybe even if you want to offer\none of the more outrageous\nexamples of things\nthat people have suddenly done\nor failed to be able to do\nas a consequence of this brain mapping?\n- Well, I think the thing to me\nthat has been the most striking\nis that, you know, some of\nthese areas you stimulate,\nand altogether, you can\nshut down someone's talking.\nSo a person says, \"I wanted to say it,\nbut I couldn't get the words out.\"\nAnd even though I've seen\nthis thousands of times now,\nit's still exciting every\ntime that I see it because,\nit's exciting because\nyou're seeing the brain,\nit's a physical organ,\nit's part of the body,\noutside of the veins on top of it,\nit doesn't look like a machine.\nBut when you do something like that\nand you focally change the way it works,\nand you see that because the\nperson can't talk anymore\nand they say, \"I know what I want to say,\nbut I couldn't get the words out,\"\nyou're confronted with this idea\nthat that organ is the\nbasis of speech and language\nand way beyond that, obviously,\nyou know, for all the other functions\nthat we have for thinking\nand feeling our emotions, everything.\nSo that, to me, is a constant reminder\nof, you know, this really\nspecial thing that the brain does\nwhich is compute so many\nof the things that we do,\nand in particular in the area\naround speech and\nlanguage, generating words,\nsomething that is really\nunique to our species,\nis just extraordinary to see.\nAgain, even though I've\nseen it thousands of times,\nit's just having that connection\nbecause it doesn't look like a machine,\nbut it is doing something\nthat is quite complicated,\nprecise, and remarkable.\n- Do you ever see emotional responses\nfrom stimulation in particular areas?\nAnd do you ever hear or\nsee emotional responses\nthat are associated with\nparticular types of speech?\nBecause, for instance,\ncurse words are known to,\npeople with Tourette's often will curse,\nnot always, sometimes they'll\nhave tics or other things.\nBut what I learned from\na colleague of ours\nis that curse words have a\ncertain structure to them.\nThere's usually a heavy\nor kind of a sharp\nconsonant up front, right,\nthat allows people, at least\nas it was described to me,\nto have some sort of emotional release.\nIt's not a word like murmur,\nwhich has kind of a soft entry here,\nI'm not using the technical language,\nand you pick your favorite\ncurse word out there, folks.\nI'm not going to shout out\nany now or say any now,\nbut that certain words\nhave a structure to them\nthat, because of the motor patterns\nthat are involved in saying that word,\nyou could imagine it has an\nemotional response unto itself.\nSo when stimulating\nor when blocking these\ndifferent brain areas,\ndo you ever see people get angry or sad\nor happy or more relaxed?\n- Oh, well, definitely I've seen cases\nwhere you can invoke anxiety, stress,\nand I think that there are also\nareas that you can stimulate\nand you can also evoke\nthe opposite of that,\nsort of like a calm state.\n- I think that brain area is\nslightly hyperactive in you,\nor at least more than me.\nIn all the years I've known you,\nyou've always been, at least\nexternally, a very calm person.\nI mean, I always find it amusing\nthat you work on speech and language\nand you have a very calming voice.\nAnd I'm being really serious.\nI think that there's a huge\nvariation in that, right,\nin terms of how people speak\nand how they accent words.\n- Absolutely, yeah.\nSo there are areas,\nfor example, the orbitofrontal\ncortex that we showed\nthat if you stimulate there...\nThe orbitofrontal cortex\nis a part of the brain\nthat's above the eyes.\nThat's why they call it orbitofrontal,\nmeaning it's above the eye or the orbit\nand in the frontal lobe, and\nit's this area right in here.\nIt has really complex functions.\nIt's really important\nfor learning and memory.\nBut one of the things that we observed\nis when you stimulate in there,\npeople tended to have a\nreduction in their stress,\nand it was very much related\nto their state of being,\nmeaning that if someone was\nalready kind of feeling normal\nand you stimulate there,\nit didn't do much.\nBut if someone was in\na very anxious state,\nit actually relieved that.\nAnd then we've seen the corollary of that\nwhich is true, too,\nwhich is that there are other areas\nlike the amygdala or parts of the insula\nthat if you stimulate,\nyou can cause an acute temporary anxiety,\na nervous feeling,\nor if you stimulate the insula,\npeople can have an acute\nfeeling of disgust.\nSo, you know, the brain\nhas different functions\nand these different nodes that\nhelp process the way we feel.\nCertainly, I think that, to some degree,\nneuropsychiatric conditions\nreflect an imbalance\nof the electrical\nactivities in these areas.\nOne of the things that was\nsomething I will never forget\nwas taking care of a young woman\nwith uncontrolled seizures.\nWe call that epilepsy.\nIt's a medical condition where someone\nhas uncontrolled electrical\nactivity in the brain.\nSometimes you can see that as convulsions\nwhere people are shaking\nand lose consciousness.\nThere are other kind of\nseizures that people can have\nwhere they don't lose consciousness,\nbut they can have experiences\nthat just come out of nowhere\njust as a result of electrical activity\ncoming from the brain.\nAnd about six years ago, I\ntook care of a young woman\nwho was diagnosed psychiatrically\nwith anxiety disorder for several years.\nIt turns out that it wasn't\nreally an anxiety disorder.\nIt was actually that she\nhad underlying seizures,\nan epilepsy activating a part of her brain\nthat evokes, you know, anxious feelings.\n- How was that discovered?\nBecause I know a lot of\npeople out there have anxiety.\nI mean, in the absence of a brain scan,\nhow or why would one suspect\nthat maybe they have a tumor\nor some other condition\nthat was causing those\nneurons to become hyperactive?\n- Yeah, that's really important\nbecause so many people have anxiety,\nand the vast, vast majority\nare not having that\nbecause they're having\nseizures in the brain.\nI think one of the ways\nthat this was diagnosed\nwas that the nature\nof when she was having these panic attacks\nwas not triggered by anything.\nThey would just happen spontaneously.\nAnd that's what can happen\nwith seizures sometimes.\nThey just come out of nowhere.\nWe don't fully understand\nwhat can trigger them,\nbut they weren't things\nthat were typically anxiety-provoking.\nThis is something that just\nhappened all of a sudden.\nAnd because you brought it up,\nthis is not something that\nyou can see on an MRI.\nWe could not see and look at\nthe structure of her brain,\nwith an MRI, that she was having seizures.\nThe only way that we\ncould actually prove this\nwas actually putting\nelectrodes into her brain\nand proving that these\nattacks that she was having\nwere localized to a part\ncalled the amygdala,\nit's a medial part of the\ntemporal lobe, which is here,\nand associating the electrical activity\nthat we were seeing on those electrodes\nwith the symptoms that she had,\nand she ultimately\nneeded a kind of surgery\nwhere she was awake in\norder to remove this safely.\n- Speaking of epilepsy,\na number of people out there have epilepsy\nor know people who do.\nAre the drugs for epilepsy satisfactory?\nYou know, I think about\nthings like Depakote,\nyou know, and adjusting the excitation\nand inhibition of the brain.\nI mean, are there good drugs for epilepsy?\nWe know there are not great drugs\nfor a lot of other conditions.\nAnd how often does one need neurosurgery\nin order to treat epilepsy?\nOr can it be treated most\noften just using pharmacology?\n- Yeah, great question.\nWell, a lot of people have seizures\nthat can be completely controlled\nby their medications, a lot.\nBut there's about a one-third\nof people who have epilepsy,\nwhich we define as anyone who's\nhad three or more seizures\nthat, you know, about a third of them\nactually don't have control\nwith all of the modern\nmedications that we have nowadays.\nAnd some of the data suggests\nthat if you have two or three medications,\nit actually doesn't matter necessarily\nwhich of the anti-seizure\nmedications it is,\nbut there is data suggests\nif you've just tried two or three,\nthe fourth, fifth, sixth, and beyond\nis not likely to help control it.\nSo we are in a situation, unfortunately,\nwhere a lot of the medications\nare great for some people,\nbut for another subset,\nthey can't control it,\nand it comes from a\nparticular part of the brain.\nNow, fortunately, in that subset,\nthere's another part of that group\nthat can benefit from a surgery\nthat actually either removes\nthat part of the brain,\nand nowadays, we'll use stimulators now\nto sometimes put electrical stimulation\nin that part of the brain\nto help reduce the seizures.\n- And you said a third\nof people with epilepsy\nmight need neurosurgery?\n- Well, what I mean by that\nis, like, they continue to have seizures\nthat are not controlled\nby all medications,\nand there's going to be\nanother subset of those\nthat may benefit from a surgery.\nIt's probably not that whole\nthird, it's a subset of that.\nIt's just to say that epilepsy\ncan be really hard to get fixed.\nAnd for people where the\nseizures come from one spot\nor, you know, an area,\nthen surgery can do great.\nIf it comes from multiple areas\nor if it comes from the whole brain,\nthen we have to think about\nother methods to control it.\nFortunately, nowadays,\nthere's actually other ways.\nSurgery now, to us,\ndoesn't just mean removing\npart of the brain.\nHalf of what we do now is use stimulators\nthat modulate the state of the brain\nthat can help reduce the seizures.\n- I've heard before\nthat the ketogenic diet\nwas originally formulated\nin order to treat epilepsy\nand, in particular, in kids.\nIs that true, and why would\nbeing in a ketogenic state\nwith low blood glucose reduce seizures?\n- That's a great question.\nAnd to be honest, I don't know actually\nif it was originally\ndesigned to treat seizures,\nbut I can tell you for\nsure that for some people,\njust like with some medications,\nit can be a life-changing thing.\nIt can completely change the\nway that the brain works.\nAnd it's not something\nthat's for everybody,\nbut for some people, there's no question,\nand it has some very beneficial effects.\nI think it's to be determined still,\nlike why and how that works.\n- I've heard similar things\nabout the ketogenic diet\nfor people with Alzheimer's dementia,\nthat there's nothing particularly relevant\nabout ketosis to Alzheimer's per se,\nbut because Alzheimer's changes the way\nthat neurons metabolize energy\nthat shifting to an alternate fuel source\ncan sometimes make people feel better,\nand so a number of\npeople are now trying it.\nBut it's not as if blood\nglucose and having carbohydrates\nis causing Alzheimer's.\nAnd people get confused often\nthat just because something can help\ndoesn't mean that the\nopposite is harming somebody.\nSo I find this really interesting.\nSometime I'll check back with\nyou about what's happening\nin terms of ketogenic diets and epilepsy.\nBut you said that in\nsome cases, it can help.\nHas that observation been made\nboth for children and for adults?\nBecause I thought that, originally,\nthe ketogenic diet for epilepsy\nwas really for pediatric epilepsy.\n- Yeah, that's right.\nSo a lot of its focus has really\nbeen on kids with epilepsy,\nbut certainly it's a safe thing to try,\nso a lot of adults, you\nknow, will try it as well.\n- Interesting.\nI'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or usually twice a day,\nis that it gets me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\nthat communicate with the\nbrain, the immune system,\nand basically all the\nbiological systems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health,\nand those probiotics in Athletic Greens\nare optimal and vital\nfor microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens, vitamins,\nand minerals that make sure\nthat all of my foundational\nnutritional needs are met,\nand it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of Vitamin D3+K2.\nI'm curious about epilepsy\nfor another reason.\nI was taught that epilepsy is an imbalance\nin the excitation and\ninhibition in the brain.\nSo you think about these electrical storms\nthat give people either grand mal,\nyou know, shaking and kind of convulsions.\nBut years ago, I was reading a book,\na wonderful book actually,\ncalled \"Einstein in\nLove\" by Dennis Overbye.\nIt was about Einstein and\nI guess his personal life.\nPeople who knew him\nclaimed that he would\nsometimes walk along,\nand then every once in\na while would just stop\nand kind of stare off into space\nfor anywhere from a minute\nto three to five minutes,\nand it was speculated that\nhe had absence seizures.\nWhat is an absence seizure?\nAnd the reason I ask is I\noccasionally will be walking along\nand I'll be thinking about\nsomething and I'll stop.\nBut in my mind, I'm\nthinking during that time,\nbut I realize that if I were\nto see myself from the outside,\nit might appear that I\nwas just kind of absent.\nWhat is an absence seizure?\nBecause it's so strikingly\ndifferent in its description\nfrom, say, a grand mal convulsive seizure.\n- Sure, well, like I mentioned before,\ndepending on how the seizure\nactivity spreads in the brain\nor how it actually propagates,\nif it stays in one particular spot\nand doesn't spread to the entire brain,\nit can have really\ndifferent manifestation.\nIt can represent really differently.\nSo absence seizure is just one category\nof different kind of seizures\nwhere you can lose\nconsciousness basically,\nand what I mean by that is\nthat you're not fully aware\nof what's going on in\nyour environment, okay?\nSo you're sort of taken offline\ntemporarily from consciousness,\nbut you could still be,\nfor example, standing,\nand to people who are\nnot paying attention,\nthey may not even be aware\nthat that's happening.\n- What are some other types of seizures?\n- Well, you know, I think\nsome of the other kinds,\nthe classic ones are\ntemporal lobe seizures.\nSo these are ones that come\nfrom the medial structures\nlike the amygdala and hippocampus.\nOftentimes people, when they\nhave seizures coming from that,\nthey may taste something very\nunusual like a metallic taste\nor smell something like\nthe smell of burning toast,\nsomething like that.\nThere are some people, with\ntemporal lobe seizures,\nwill have deja vu.\nThey will have that experience\nthat you've been somewhere before,\nbut that's just a\nprecursor to the seizure.\nAnd it just highlights that\nwhen people have seizures\ncoming from these areas,\nthey sometimes hijack what\nthat part of the brain\nis really for.\nSo the amygdala and\nhippocampus, for example,\nare really important\nfor learning and memory.\nIt's not surprising that when\npeople have seizures there\nthat it can evoke a feeling of deja vu\nor that it can evoke a feeling of anxiety.\nAnd the areas that are right\nnext to it, for example,\nthese areas are really\nimportant for processing smell.\nSo these areas are\nright next to each other\nso you can have these kind\nof complex set of symptoms,\nthe weird taste, the smell of toast,\nand then a feeling of deja vu,\nthat's classic for a\ntemporal lobe seizure,\nand it's because those parts of the brain\nthat process those functions\nare right next to each other.\n- I'm told that I've\nhad nocturnal seizures,\nand I've woken up sometimes from sleep\nhaving felt as if I was\nhaving a convulsion,\nthe sort of sense of buzzing\nin the back of the head.\nThis happened to me two\nor three times in college.\nWell, I woke up and my\ngirlfriend was very distraught,\nlike, \"You were having a seizure.\"\nI was having full convulsion in my sleep.\nIs that correct?\nIs there such a thing\nas nocturnal seizures?\nWhat do they reflect?\nThey eventually stopped happening,\nand I couldn't tether them\nto any kind of life event.\nI wasn't doing any kind of combat sport\nor anything at the time,\nI wasn't drinking alcohol much,\nit's never really been my thing.\nWhat are nocturnal seizures about?\n- [Eddie] Oh, well-\n- And do I need brain surgery?\n[Andrew laughs]\n[Eddie laughs]\n- Nocturnal seizures\nare just another form.\nLike, again, epilepsy and seizures\ncan have so many different forms\nand not just, like, where in the brain,\nbut also when they happen.\nAnd there are some people\nwho, for whatever reason,\nit's very timed to the circadian rhythm.\nIt's actually not just happening at night,\nbut a certain period at night\nwhen people are in a\ncertain stage of sleep\nthat the brain is in a state\nthat it's vulnerable to having a seizure,\nand so that's basically\njust one form of that.\nAgain, it's not just about\nwhere it's coming from,\nbut also when it's happening\nand how that's timed\nwith other things that are\nhappening with the body.\n- Interesting.\nWell, it eventually stopped happening\nso I stopped worrying about it.\nI haven't had seizures since.\nReturning to speech and language,\nwhen I was getting weaned in neuroscience,\nI learned that we have\nan area of the brain\nfor producing speech\nand we have an area of the\nbrain for comprehending speech.\nWhat's the story there?\nIs it still true\nthat we have a Broca's\nand a Wernicke's area?\nThose are names of\nneurologists, presumably,\nor neurosurgeons that discovered\nthese different brain areas.\nMaybe you could familiarize us\nwith some of the sort of textbook version\nof how speech and language\nare organized in the brain,\nmaybe share with us a little\nbit of the lesion studies\nthat led to that understanding,\nand then I would love to hear a bit\nabout what your laboratory is discovering\nabout how things are actually organized,\nbecause from some discussions\nyou and I have had\nover the last year or so,\nit seems like, well, let's just be blunt,\nit seems that much of what\nwe know from the textbooks\ncould be wrong.\n- Well, I love that question\nbecause, for me, it's very\ncentral to the research we do,\nand it's where the intersection\nbetween what we do in the\nlaboratory in our research\ninterfaces with what I see in patients.\nAnd one of the things that fascinated me\nearly on in my medical training\nwas in doing some of these brain mapping\nor watching them with my mentor\nor taking care of patients that\nhad, you know, brain tumors\nin a certain part of the brain\nwas that, a lot of times,\nwhat I was seeing in a patient\ndid not correlate with what I\nwas taught in medical school.\nAnd, you know, some people will think,\nwell, this might be an exception,\nbut after you see it for a couple times\nand if you're kind of\ninterested in this problem,\nyou know, it poses a serious challenge\nto what you've learned\nand how you think about\nhow these things operate.\nAnd that actually got me really interested\nin trying to figure this out\nbecause, earlier, we talked about\njust this extraordinary\nthing that the brain is doing\nto create words and sentences,\nand that's the process by\nwhich I'm getting ideas out\nfrom my mind into yours.\nIt's an incredible thing, right?\nIt's the basis of communication,\nhigh information communication\nbetween two individuals\nthat's really unique to humans.\nSo in historical times,\nhow this works has been very controversial\nfrom day one of neuroscience.\nA long time ago, people\nthought the bumps on your head\ncorresponded to the different\nfaculties of the mind.\nSo for example, if you had a bump here,\nit might be corresponding to intelligence\nor another one over\nhere, you know, to vision\nand these kind of things.\nThat's what we nowadays call phrenology,\nand that was kind of the starting point.\nA lot of that has been,\nof course, debunked,\nbut when you see those little statues\nof different brain\npartitions on someone's head,\nthat's essentially how people\nwere thinking about how\nthe brain worked back then,\na couple hundred years ago.\nModern neuroscience began when,\nactually, it was very much related\nto the discovery of language.\nSo modern neuroscience,\nmeaning moving beyond this idea\nthat the bumps on the scalp\ncorresponded to the faculties of the mind,\nbut there were things\nthat actually were in\nthe brain themselves,\nand they weren't corresponding to things\nthat you could see superficially,\nlike on the scalp or externally,\nthat it was something\nabout the brain itself.\nI mean, it seems so obvious now,\nbut back then, this was the\nbig academic, you know, debate.\nAnd the first observation\nthat I think was really\nimpactful in the area of language\nwas an observation by\na French neurosurgeon\nnamed Pierre Broca.\nAnd what he observed\nwas that in a patient,\nnot that he did surgery in,\nbut that he had seen and taken care of,\nthat the person couldn't talk.\nAnd, in particular, they\ncalled this individual Tan\nbecause the only words that\nhe could produce was tan, tan.\nFor the most part,\nhe could generally\nunderstand the kind of things\nthat people were asking him about,\nbut the only thing that he\ncould utter from his mouth\nwere these words, tan, tan.\nAnd what eventually had happened\nwas this individual passed away,\nand the way that neuroscience\nwas done back then\nwas basically to wait until that happened\nand then to remove the brain\nand to see what part of\nthe brain was affected\nin this patient that they called Tan.\nAnd what Broca found was\nthat there was a part\nin the left frontal lobe,\nso the frontal lobe is this\narea like I described earlier,\nwhich is, you know, up\nbehind our forehead, up here,\nand in the back of that frontal lobe,\nhe claimed that this was\nthe seat of articulation\nin the brain.\nHe literally used something\nlike that in French,\nthe seat of articulation,\nmeaning that this is the part of the brain\nthat is responsible for\nus to generate words.\nAbout 50 years later, the\nstory becomes more complicated\nwith a German neurologist\nnamed Carl Wernicke.\nAnd what Wernicke described\nwas a different set of symptoms\nin patients that he observed\na different phenomenon\nwhere people could produce words,\nbut a lot of the words,\nand they were fluent in the sense\nthat, like, they sound like\nthey could be real words\nbut from a different\nlanguage, for example.\nAnd some of us call that,\nlike, word salad or jargon.\nThey were essentially making up words,\nbut it was not intentional.\nIt was just the way\nthat the words came out.\nBut in addition to that, he\nobserved that these people\nalso could not understand\nwhat was being said to them.\nSo we could be having a conversation,\nand I'd be asking you, \"Am I a woman?\"\nAnd you might nod your head,\nyou know, just because you're\nnot processing the question.\nAnd so here are two observations.\nOne is that the frontal lobe is important\nfor articulating speech,\ncreating the words and\nexpressing them fluently.\nAnd then a different part of the brain\ncalled the left temporal lobe,\nwhich is this area right above my ear,\nthat is an area that I think was claimed\nto be really important for understanding.\nSo the two major functions in language,\nto speak and to understand,\nwere kind of pinned down to that,\nand we've had that basic\nidea in the textbooks\nfor, you know, over 200 years.\n- It's certainly what I was taught.\n- [Eddie] Is that right?\n- Oh, yeah, and certainly what we still,\nwe still teach undergraduates,\ngraduate students,\nand medical students that.\n- Well, that's what I learned,\ntoo, in medical school.\nAnd what I saw in reality\nwhen I started taking care of patients\nwas that it's not so simple.\nIn fact, part of it is\nfundamentally wrong.\nSo just in a nutshell,\nnowadays, after, you know,\nlooking at this very carefully\nover hundreds of patients,\nwe've shown that surgeries,\nfor example, in the posterior\npart of the frontal lobe,\na lot of times, people have\nno problem talking at all\nwhatsoever after those kind of surgeries,\nand that it's a different\npart of the brain\nthat we call the precentral gyrus.\nThe precentral gyrus\nis a part of the brain\nthat is intimately associated\nwith the motor cortex.\nThe motor cortex is the part of the brain\nthat has a map of your entire body\nso that it has a part that\ncorresponds to your feet,\nit has a part that\ncorresponds to your hands.\nBut then there's another part\nthat comes out more laterally\non the side of the brain\nthat corresponds to your\nlips, your jaw, your larynx,\nand we have seen that when\npatients have surgeries\nor injuries to that part of the brain,\nit actually can really interrupt language,\nso it's not as simple\nas just moving the muscles\nof the vocal tract,\nbut it's also important for formulating\nand expressing words.\nSo that's Broca's area\nthat I think the field now recognizes\nnot just because of our work,\nbut many other people\nthat have studied this\nin stroke and beyond,\nis that the idea\nthat that is the basis of\nspeaking in Broca's area\nis fundamentally wrong right now,\nand we have to figure out\nhow to correct the textbooks\nthat we kind of understand that\nso that we can continue to make progress.\nNow, in terms of the other major area\nthat we call Wernicke's area\nin the posterior temporal lobe,\nthat has held,\nI think, quite legitimately for some time.\nSo that is an area that you\nhave to be super careful\nwhen you do surgery there.\nThat's an area where,\nif you have a mistake there\nand you cause a stroke\nor you remove too much of the tumor there,\nyou go too far beyond it,\nthen the person can be\nreally, really hurt.\nLike, they'll have a\ncondition that we call aphasia\nwhere they may not be\nable to understand words,\nthey may not be able to remember the word\nthat they're trying to say.\nThey know what they're trying to say,\nbut they can't remember the precise word\nthat goes with the object that\nthey're trying to think of.\nThey may even produce words\nthat I described before are\nlike word salad or very jargony.\nSo, you know, they might say\nsomething like tamiranai.\nThat's not a real word,\nbut it sounds like it could be, you know?\nAnd that's just because\nthat part of the brain\nhas some role not just in\nunderstanding what we hear,\nbut also actually has\na really important role\nin sending the commands to\ndifferent parts of the brain\nto control what we say.\n- Not long ago, you and me\nand my good friend Rick Rubin\nwere having a conversation\nabout medicine and science,\nand Rick asked the question,\n\"What percentage of what you learned\nin graduate and/or medical\nschool do you think is correct?\"\nAnd you had a very interesting answer.\nWould you share it with us?\n- I don't know. I don't\nremember the exact.\nBut I would say\nthat with regard to the\nbrain in particular,\nI would say about 50%\ngets it right and accurate and is helpful,\nbut another 50% is just the approximation\nand oversimplification of what's going on.\nThe example that we talked about,\nlanguage is just an example of that.\nIt's just there are things\nthat make it easier to learn\nand easier to teach and\neasier to even think about,\nand that's probably why\nwe continue teaching\nin the way that we do.\nBut I think as time goes on,\nthe complexity of reality\nof how the brain works\nis, well, first of all,\nwe're still trying to figure it out,\nand second of all, it is complex\nand it's still incomplete story.\n- It's early days.\nAnd we'll get into some\nof the technical advances\nthat are allowing some\ncorrection of the errors\nthat the field has made.\nAnd, look, no disrespect\nto the brain explorers\nthat came before us,\nand the ones that come after\nus will correct us, right?\nThat's the way the game is played.\nBut what I'm hearing\nis that there are certain\ntruths that people accept,\nand then there's about\nhalf of the information\nthat is still open for debate\nand maybe even for complete revision.\nOne thing that I learned about language\nand the neural circuits\nunderlying language\nis that it's heavily lateralized,\nthat these structures,\nBroca's and Wernicke's\nand other structures in the brain\nresponsible for speech and\ncomprehension of speech\nsit mainly on one side of the brain,\nbut they do not have a\nmirror representation\nor another equivalent area\non the opposite side of the brain.\nAnd for those that haven't\npoked around in a lot of brains,\ncertainly you, Eddie,\nhave done far more of that than I have,\nbut I've done my fair\nshare in nonhuman species\nand a little bit in humans,\nalmost every structure,\nalmost every structure\nhas a matching structure\non the other side of the brain,\nso when we say the hippocampus,\nwe really mean two hippocampi,\none on each side of the brain.\nBut language, I was taught,\nis heavily lateralized,\nthat is, that there's only one.\nSo that raises two\nquestions. One, is that true?\nAnd if it is true, then what\nis the equivalent real estate\non the opposite side of the brain doing\nif it's not doing the same function\nthat the one on, say, the\nleft side is performing?\n- Well, that's one of those things\nthat is, again, like\nmostly true, not 100%.\nAnd what I mean by that\nis that it's complicated.\nSo for people who are right-handed,\n99% of the time, the\nlanguage part of the brain\nis on the left side.\n- And what is the equivalent brain area\non the right side doing if\nit's not doing language?\n- Well, you know, the\nthing that's incredible\nis if you look at the right side\nand you look at it very carefully,\neither under an MRI\nor you actually look at the brain\nunder slides in a microscope,\nit looks very, very similar.\nIt's not identical, but it\nlooks very, very similar.\nAll the gyri, which are\nthe bumps on the brain\nthat, you know, have\nthe different contours\nand the valleys that we call sulci,\nthose all look basically the same.\nLike, there is a mirror anatomy\non the left and right side,\nand so it's not been so clear\nwhat's so special actually\nabout the left side\nto house language.\nBut what we do know,\nand this is what we use\nall the time in assessing\nand figuring out, you\nknow, this before surgery,\nis if you're right-handed,\n99% of the time, the\nlanguage is going to be\non the left side of the brain.\n- Is handedness genetic in any way?\nI mean, when I grew up,\n- Yes.\n- a pen or a pencil or crayon\nwas placed into my hand\npresumably, or I started using...\nMy father was left-handed,\nand then where he grew\nup in South America,\nthey forced him to force\nhimself to become right-handed.\nThey actually used to restrict\nthe movement of his left hand\nso he was forced to write...\nAnd then you have hook\nlefties and hook righties.\nAnd I know this is a deep dive\nand we probably don't want to go\ninto every derivation of this,\nbut so for somebody who's left-handed,\nnaturally just starts\nwriting with the left hand,\nthere's some genetic predisposition\nto being left-handed?\n- Absolutely. No question about it.\nHandedness is not entirely\nbut strongly genetic.\nSo there is something\nthat ties all of this,\nand what does handedness,\nfor example, have to do\nwith the part of your brain\nthat controls language?\nWell, it turns out that the\nparts that control the hand\nare very close to the areas\nthat really are responsible\nfor the vocal tract.\nAgain, part of the motor cortex\nand part of this brain area\ncalled the precentral gyrus.\nAnd there are some theories\nthat, because of their proximity,\nthat these parts of the brain\nmight develop together early in utero\nand they might have a head start\ncompared to the right side,\nand because they have a head start\nthat things solidify there.\nThis is one theory of why this happens.\nIn people who are left-handed,\nit still turns out that\nthe vast majority of people\nhave language on the left side,\nbut it's not 99%, it's more like 70%.\nSo if you're left-handed,\nit's still more likely that\nthe language part of your brain\nis going to be on the left side,\nbut there's going to be a greater\nproportion, maybe 20, 30%,\nwhere it's either in both\nhemispheres or on the right side.\nAnd just to make this a\nlittle bit more interesting\nis that when people have\nstrokes on the left side,\nand if they are lucky enough\nto recover from those strokes,\nsometimes that involves reorganization,\nthis term that we call plasticity earlier,\nwhere the areas around where the stroke\ntake on that new function\nin a way that they didn't have before.\nThat can certainly happen\nin the left hemisphere,\nbut there are also instances\nwhere the right hemisphere\ncan also start to take on\nthe function of language\nwhere it was once on left and\nthen transfers to the right.\nSo the thing that I think about a lot\nis that the machinery\nprobably exists on both sides,\nbut we don't use them\ntogether all the time.\nIn fact, we may strongly\nbias one side or the other.\nJust like we use our two hands\nin very, very different ways,\nit's a little bit the same with the brain.\nWell, it's because of\nwhat we do with the brain\nthat actually is why we use\nthe hands in different ways.\nAnd the same thing goes for language,\nwhich is that, again, the\nsubstrates, the organ,\nthe language organ, the part\nof the brain that process it\nprobably has very similar machinery\non the left side as the right,\nand the right may have\nthe capability to do it,\nbut in real, everyday use,\nthe brain specializes one of the sides\nin order for us to use it functionally.\nThat's a theory.\n- You're bilingual, correct?\n- Yeah.\n- [Andrew] You speak English and Chinese?\n- Yeah.\n- For people that are bilingual\nand that learn two or more,\nwell, bilingual is two, obviously,\nbut learn both languages\nor let's say more languages\nfrom an early time in life,\ndo they use the same brain\narea to generate that language?\nOr perhaps they use the\nleft side to speak English\nand the right side to speak Chinese?\nDo we know anything about\nbilingualism in the brain?\n- Well, I think we know a lot\nabout bilingualism in the brain.\nThe answers are still out\nthere, the final answers on it,\nand part of the answer is yes, absolutely,\nwe use some parts of the\nbrain very similarly.\nWe actually have a study\nin the lab right now\nwhere we're looking at this\nwhere people who speak\none language or another\nor are bilingual,\nand we're looking at how the\nbrain activity patterns occur\nwhen they're hearing one\nlanguage versus the other.\nAnd what's striking to see, actually,\nis how overlapping they really can be.\nEven though the person may have no idea\nof the language that they're hearing,\nthe English part of the brain\nis still processing that\nand maybe trying to interpret it\nthrough an English lens, for example.\nSo the short answer is\nthat with bilingualism,\nthere are shared circuitry,\nthere's this shared machinery in the brain\nthat allows us to process\nboth, but it's not identical.\nIt's the same part of the brain,\nbut what it's doing with the signals\ncan be very, very different.\nAnd what I mean by that precisely\nis not the instantaneous detecting\nof one sound to the next,\nbut the memory of the sequences\nof those particular sounds\nthat give rise to things\nlike words and meaning,\nthat can be highly variable\nfrom one individual to the next,\nand those neurons are very, very sensitive\nto the sequences of the sounds,\neven though the sounds themselves\nmight have some overlap between languages.\n- Fascinating.\nOkay, so we've talked about brain areas\nand a little bit about lateralization.\nI want to get back to the hands\nand some things related to\nemotion in a little bit.\nBut maybe now we could\ngo into those brain areas\nand start to ask the question,\nwhat exactly is represented\nor mapped there?\nAnd for people who perhaps aren't familiar\nwith brain mapping and\nrepresentation and receptive fields,\nperhaps the simplest analogy\nmight be the visual system\nwhere I look at your face,\nI know you, I recognize you,\nand certainly there are brain areas\nthat are responsible for face recognition.\nBut the fact that I know\nthat that's your face,\nand for those listening, I'm\nlooking into Eddie's face,\nthe fact that I know that\nthat's your face at all\nis because we are well\naware that there are cells\nthat represent edges and that\nrepresent dark and light,\nand those all combine\nin what we call a hierarchical structure.\nThey sort of build up from basic elements\nas simple as little dots,\nbut then lines and things\nthat move, et cetera,\nto give a coherent\nrepresentation of the face.\nWhen I think about language,\nI think about words and just talking.\nIf I sit down and do a long podcast\nor I think about asking you a question,\nI don't even think about the\nwords I want to say very much.\nI mean, I have to think\nabout them a little bit,\none would hope,\nbut I don't think about\nindividual syllables\nunless I'm trying to, you\nknow, accent something\nor it's a word that I have a\nparticular difficulty saying\nor I want to change\nthe cadence, et cetera.\nSo what's represented in the neurons,\nthe nerve cells in these areas?\nAre they representing vowels, consonants?\nAnd how do things like inflection...\nLike I occasionally will\npoke fun at upspeak,\nbut there's, I think, a healthy,\na normal version of upspeak\nwhere somebody's asking a question,\nlike, for instance, what is that?\nThat's an appropriate use of upspeak\nas opposed to saying something\nthat is not a question\nand putting a lilt at\nthe end of the sentence,\nthen we call that upspeak,\nwhich doesn't fit with\nwhat the person is saying.\nSo what in the world is\ncontained in these brain areas,\nwhat is represented,\nto me, is perhaps one of the\nmost interesting questions,\nand I know this lands\nsquare in your wheelhouse.\n- Sure, let's get into this, Andrew,\nbecause this is one of\nthe most exciting stuff\nthat's happening right\nnow is understanding\nhow the brain processes\nthese exact questions.\nAnd you asked me earlier,\nyou know, what is difference\nbetween speech and language?\nSpeech corresponds to\nthe communication signal.\nIt corresponds to me moving\nmy mouth and my vocal tract\nto generate words,\nand you're hearing these\nas an auditory signal.\nLanguage is something much broader.\nSo it refers to what you're extracting\nfrom the words that I'm saying,\nwe call that pragmatics\nand sort of are you getting\nthe gist of what I'm saying?\nThere's another aspect of\nit that we call semantics.\nDo you understand the meaning\nof these words and the sentences?\nThere's another part that we call syntax,\nwhich refers to how\nthe words are assembled\nin a grammatical form.\nSo those are all really\ncritical parts of language,\nand speech is just one form of language.\nThere's many other forms\nlike sign language, reading.\nThose are all important\nmodalities for reading.\nOur research really focuses on this area\nthat we're calling speech,\nagain, the production of this audio signal\nwhich you can't see but your\nmicrophones are picking up.\nThere are these vibrations in the air\nthat are created by my vocal tract\nthat are picked up by the microphone\nin the case of this recording,\nbut also picked up by\nthe sensors in your ear.\nThe very tiny vibrations in\nyour ear are picking that up\nand translating that\ninto electrical activity.\nAnd what the ear does at the periphery\nis translates all sounds\ninto different frequencies.\nSo its main thing to do\nis to take a speech signal\nor any other kind of\nsound and decompose it,\nmeaning separate that sound\ninto different kind of signals.\nAnd in the case of\nhearing, what it's doing\nis separating it out into\nlow, middle, high frequencies\nat a very, very high resolution.\nIt's doing it very quickly,\nand it's doing it in a really fine way\nto separate all of those different sounds.\nSo if you look at the periphery\nnear the nerve that goes to your ear,\nthose nerve fibers,\nsome of them are tuned to low frequencies,\nsome of them are tuned\nto high frequencies,\nsome of them are tuned to\nthe middle frequencies,\nand that is what your ear is doing.\nIt's taking these words\nand splitting them up into\ndifferent frequencies.\n- And for those of you out there\nthat aren't familiar with\nthinking about things\nin the so-called frequency space,\nbass tones would be lower frequencies\nand high-pitched tones\nwould be higher frequencies,\njust to make sure\neveryone's on the same page.\nSo the sound of my voice,\nthe sound of your voice,\nor any sound in the environment\nis being broken down\ninto these frequencies.\nAre they being broken down\ninto very narrow channels of frequency,\nor are they, I want to\navoid nomenclature here,\nor are they being binned as\nfairly broad frequencies?\n'Cause we know low, medium, and high,\nbut, for instance, I can detect\nwhether or not something's approaching me\nor moving away from me\ndepending on whether\nor not it sweeps louder\n[imitates sound approaching]\nor [imitates sound receding],\nright, towards or away.\nIt's subtle, and of course it's combined\nwith what I see and my own movement,\nBut how finely sliced\nis our perception of the auditory world?\n- Oh, extraordinarily precise.\nI mean, we take these millisecond cues,\nthe millisecond differences\nbetween the sound coming to one ear,\nlet's say your right ear versus your left,\nto understand what direction\nthat sound came from.\nThose are only millisecond differences,\nand that's how precise this works.\nBut on the other hand,\nit does a lot of computation on this\nit does a lot of analysis as you go up,\nand a lot of our work is\nfocused on the part of the brain\nthat we call the cortex.\nThe cortex is the outermost\npart of brain where we believe\nthat sounds are actually\nconverted into words and language.\nSo there's this transformation\nwhere, at the ear, words are decomposed\nand turned into these\nelemental frequency channels,\nand then as it goes up\nthrough the auditory system,\nhits the cortex.\nThere are some things\nthat happen obviously\nbefore it gets to the cortex,\nbut when it gets to cortex,\nthere's something special going on,\nwhich is that that part of the brain\nis looking for specific sounds.\nAnd specifically what I mean by that\nis the sounds of human language,\nso the ones that are the\ndifferent consonants and vowels\nin a different language.\nOne of the ways that we have studied this\nis looking in patients who have epilepsy.\nAnd in a lot of these cases\nwhere the MRI looks completely normal,\nwe have to put electrodes\nsurgically on a part of the brain.\nThe temporal lobe is a\nvery, very common place,\nso we've done a lot of our work\nlooking at how the temporal\nlobe processes speech sounds\nbecause we're looking for\nwhere the seizures start,\nbut then we're also doing brain mapping\nfor language and speech so\nwe can protect those areas.\nWe want to identify the\nareas that we want to remove\nto cure someone's seizures,\nbut we also want to figure out the areas\nthat are important for speech and language\nto protect those so\nthat we can do a surgery\nthat's effective and safe.\nAnd so in our research,\nand why it's become a\nreally important addition\nto our knowledge\nis that we have electrodes\ndirectly recording\nfrom the human brain surface.\nA lot of the technology\nwe work with right now\nis recording on the order of millimeters,\nand they can record\nmillisecond time resolution\nof neural activity,\nand what we see is extraordinary\npatterns of activity\nwhen people hear words and sentences.\nIf you look at that part of the brain\nthat we call Wernicke's area\nin this part of the temporal lobe,\nthis whole area lights up\nwhen you hear words or speech.\nAnd it's not in a way\nthat is like a general\nlight bulb warming up\nand it's generally lit up,\nbut what you actually see\nis something much, much more complicated,\nwhich is a pattern of activity,\nand what we've done in the last 10 years\nis try to understand what\ndoes that pattern come from?\nAnd if we were to look\nat each individual site\nfrom that part of the\nbrain, what would we see?\nWhat parts of words are being\ncoded by electrical activity\nin those parts of the brain?\nRemember, the cortex is\nusing electrical activity\nto transmit information and do analysis,\nand what we're doing\nis we're eavesdropping\non this part of the brain\nas it's processing speech\nto try to understand what\neach individual site is doing.\n- And what are those sites doing,\nor could you give us some examples\nof what those sites are doing?\nSo, for instance, are they\nsites that are specific for,\nor we could say even listening\nfor consonants or for vowels\nor for inflection or for emotionality?\nWhat's in there?\n- [Eddie] Okay, well-\n- What makes these, what\nmakes these cells fire?\n- Yeah, what gets them excited?\n- Yeah.\n- What gets them going\nis hearing speech.\nIn particular, there are some\nof these really focal sites,\nagain, just on the order of millimeter\nor, at some level, single neurons\nthat are tuned to consonants,\nsome are tuned to vowels,\nsome are tuned to particular\nfeatures of consonants.\nWhat I mean by that are different\ncategories of consonants.\nThere's a class of consonants\nthat we call plosive consonants.\nThis is a little bit of linguistic jargon,\nbut I'm going to make\na point here with that\nis that certain classes of\nsounds, when you make them,\nit requires you to actually\nclose your mouth temporarily.\n- Hmm. Now I'm going to\nbe thinking about this.\nSo plosive, like plosive,\nlike saying the word\nplosive requires that.\n- Exactly, so what's cool about that\nis that we actually have no idea\nwhat's going on in our\nmouth when we speak.\nWe really have no idea.\n- Some people definitely have no idea.\n[Andrew laughs]\n[Eddie laughs]\n- Well, not just like in terms\nof what you're saying sometimes,\nbut actually like how\nyou're actually moving,\nyou know, the different\nparts of vocal tract.\nAnd I have a feeling if we\nactually required understanding,\nwe would never be able to\nspeak 'cause it's so complex.\nIt's such a complex feat.\nSome people would say it's\nthe most complex motor thing\nthat we do as a species is just speaking.\nNot, you know, the extreme\nfeats of acrobatics\nor athleticism but speaking.\n- And especially when one\nobserves, you know, opera\nor people who, you\nknow, freestyle rappers.\nAnd of course it's not just\nthe lips. It's the tongue.\nAnd you've mentioned two other structures\nPharynx and larynx are the main ones.\nCan you tell us, just educate\nus at a superficial level\nwhat the pharynx and\nlarynx do differentially?\n'Cause I think most people aren't going to\nbe familiar with that.\n- Okay, sure.\nSo I'll talk primarily\nabout the larynx here for a second,\nwhich is that if you think\nabout when we're speaking,\nreally, what we're doing is\nwe're shaping the breath.\nSo even before you get to the larynx,\nyou got to start with the expiration.\nSo we fill up our lungs and\nthen we push the air out.\nThat's a normal part of breathing.\nAnd what is really amazing\nabout speech and language\nis that we evolved to take advantage\nof that normal physiologic\nthing, add a larynx,\nand what the larynx does is\nthat when you're exhaling,\nit brings the vocal folds together.\nSome people call them vocal cords.\nThey're not really cords.\nThey're really vocal folds.\nThey're two pieces of\ntissue that come together,\nand a muscle brings them together.\nAnd then what happens\nis when the air comes\nthrough the vocal folds\nwhen they're together,\nthey vibrate at really high frequencies,\nlike 100 to 200 hertz.\nYours is probably about 100 hertz.\nThe average-\n- Whereas yours is 200.\n[Andrew laughs]\n- No, no. Most male voices\nare around 100, okay?\nAnd then the average female\nvoice around 200 hertz.\n- Well, and as you know, I've\nalways had the same voice.\n- Yes, yes, the same-\n- This was a point of shame\nwhen I was a kid.\nFolks, my voice never changed.\nI always had the same voice.\nThis is a discussion for another time.\n- Yeah, well, it's a great voice,\nyou know, a great baritone voice,\nbut I know in your voice,\nit's a low-frequency voice.\nAnd the reason why men and women\ngenerally have different voice qualities\nis it has to do with\nthe size of the larynx\nand the shape of it, okay?\nSo in general, men have a\nlarger voice box or larynx,\nand the vibrating frequency,\nthe resonance frequency\nof the vocal folds when\nthe air comes through them\nis about 100 hertz for men\nand about 200 for women.\nSo what happens is,\nokay, so you take a breath in,\nand then as the air is coming out,\nthe vocal folds come together\nand the air goes through.\nThat creates the sound of the\nvoice that we call voicing,\nand that's the energy of your voice.\nIt's not just your voice characteristic,\nit's the energy of your voice.\nIt's coming from the\nlarynx there, it's a noise.\nAnd then it's the source of the voice.\nAnd then what happens is that energy,\nthat sound goes up through\nthe parts of the vocal tract,\nlike the pharynx into the oral cavity,\nwhich is your mouth and\nyour tongue and your lips.\nAnd what those things are doing\nis that they're shaping\nthe air in particular ways\nthat create consonants and vowels.\nSo that's what I mean\nby shaping the breath.\nIt just starts with this exhalation.\nYou generate the voice in the larynx,\nand then everything above\nthe larynx is moving around,\njust like the way my\nmouth is doing right now,\nto shape that air into particular patterns\nthat you can hear as words.\n- Fascinating, and\nimmediately makes me wonder\nabout more primitive or\nnon-learned vocalizations\nlike crying or laughter.\nBabies will cry, babies\nwill show laughter.\nAre those sorts of vocalizations\nproduced by the language\nareas like Wernicke's,\nor do they have their own\nunique neural structures?\n- Yeah, interesting question.\nSo we call those vocalizations.\nA vocalization is basically where someone\ncan create a sound, like a cry or a moan,\nthat kind of sound,\nand it also involves\nthe exhalation of air.\nIt also involves some\nphonation at the level larynx\nwhere the vocal folds come together\nto create that audible sound.\nBut it turns out that those\nare actually different areas,\nso people who have injuries in\nthe speech and language areas\noftentimes can still moan,\nthey can still vocalize,\nand it is a different part of the brain,\nI would say an area that\neven nonhuman primates have\nthat can be specialized,\nyou know, for vocalization.\nIt's a different form of communication\nthan words, for example.\n- The intricacy of these\ncircuits in the brain\nand their connections to the\npharynx and larynx is just,\nit's almost overwhelming\nin terms of thinking about just\nhow complicated it must be,\nand yet some general\nfeatures and principles\nare starting to emerge from your work\nand from the work of others.\nIf we think about that work\nand we think about, for\ninstance, Wernicke's area,\nif I were to record from\nneurons in Wernicke's area\nat different locations,\nwould I find that there's any\nkind of systematic layout?\nFor instance, in terms of, you\ntalked about sound frequency,\nwe know that low frequencies\nare represented at one end of a structure\nand high frequencies at the other.\nThis is true actually, at\nleast from my earlier training,\nwithin the ear itself, within the cochlea,\nthe early work of von Bekesy\nand from cadavers, right?\nThey actually figured\nthis out from dead people,\nwhich is incredible.\nA fascinating literature\npeople should look up.\nAnd in the visual system,\nwe know that, for instance,\nyou know, visual position,\nwhere things are is mapped systematically.\nIn other words,\nneurons that sit next to\neach other in the brain\nrepresent portions of visual space\nthat are next to each\nother in the real world.\nWhat is the organization of language\nin areas like Wernicke's and Broca's?\nFor instance, I think of\nthe vowels, A, E, I, O, U,\nas kind of a coherent unit,\nbut do I find the A neurons\nare next to the E neurons\nor next to the A, E, I, O, U.\nIs that vowel representation\nalso laid out in order,\nor is it kind of salt\nand pepper, is it random?\n- That's been one of the,\nlike, most important questions\nwe've been trying to\nanswer for the past decade.\nSo there is a part of the brain\nthat we call the primary auditory cortex,\nand the primary auditory cortex\nis deep in the temporal lobe.\nAnd if you looked at\nthat part of the brain,\nthere is a map of different\nsound frequencies.\nSo if you look at the front of\nthat primary auditory cortex,\nyou'll find low-frequency sounds,\nand then as you march\nbackwards in that cortex,\nit goes from low to medium\nto high frequencies.\nIt's organized in this\nreally nice and orderly way.\nAnd it turns out there's not just one.\nThere's, like, mirrors of\nthat tone frequency map\nin the primary auditory cortex.\nThe areas that are really\nimportant for speech\nare on the side of that.\nAnd we now think that speech\ncan go straight to the speech cortex\nwithout having to go through\nthe primary auditory cortex,\nthat it has its own pathway to\nget to the part of the brain\nthat processes speech.\nAnd when we've looked at that\nquestion about is there a map,\nthe short answer is yes, there is a map,\nbut it is not structured\nuniversally across all people\nin a way that we can\nclearly see right now.\nIt is like a salt and pepper map\nof the different features in speech.\nSo before, we talked about these sounds\nthat are called plosives.\nYou make a plosive when the mouth\nor something in the oral\ncavity closes temporarily,\nand when it opens,\nthat creates that fast plosive sound.\nSo when you say dad\nor, you know, like the B in ball,\nthat kind of thing,\nyou will notice that\nyour lips actually close,\nand then it's the release of that\nthat creates that particular sounds, okay?\nSo those are the sounds\nthat we call plosive.\nThose are like ba da ga, pa ta ka,\nThose are a certain class of consonants\nthat we call plosive sounds.\nThere is another class of sounds\nthat we call fricatives in linguistics.\nFricatives are created by turbulence\nin the airstream as it\ncomes out through the mouth,\nand the way that we make that turbulence\nis getting the mouth and the lips to close\nalmost until they're completely shut\nor putting the tongue to near the teeth\nto almost get it completely shut\nbut just have a narrow aperture,\nthat creates a turbulence in the airflow\nthat we perceive as a\nhigh-frequency sound.\nSo those are the sounds like sha and tha,\nthose kind of things.\nThose are, if you look at the frequencies,\nthey're higher frequencies,\nand those are created\nby specific movements\nthat you constrict the\nairflow to create turbulence,\nand we hear it as sha, sa, tha.\n- So if I say that.\n- [Eddie] Exactly.\n- And as opposed to a plosive\nwhere I'd say explosive.\n- [Eddie] Right.\n- Of course, I'm emphasizing here.\nWell, this explains something\nand solves a mystery,\nwhich is recently I've\nbeen fascinated by the work\nof a physician scientist back east,\nDr. Shanna Swan, who's done a lot of work\non things that are contained\nin pesticides and foods\nthat are changing hormone levels,\nand she refers to phthalates,\nwhich is spelled...\nSo it's both a plosive and a tha,\nso it's combining the two,\nand it's one of the most difficult words\nin the English language to pronounce,\nsecond only perhaps\nto the correct pronunciation\nof ophthalmology.\n[Eddie laughs]\n[Andrew laughs]\nSo it's a combination of a plosive\nand one of these tha sounds,\nand that's probably why it's difficult.\n- That's exactly right.\nIn fact, we have a term for that.\nThat's called a consonant cluster.\nSo sometimes syllables will\njust have one consonant,\nbut when we start stacking\ncertain syllables in a sequence,\nand there's rules that actually\ngovern which consonants\ncan be in a particular\nsequence for a given language,\nthat makes it more complicated.\nAnd certain languages\nhave a lot more constant\nclusters than others.\n- For instance-\n- So for instance,\nRussian, for example, has a\nlot of consonant clusters.\nEnglish has a lot of them.\nThere are other languages\nthat have very, very few.\nFor example, Hawaiian.\nHawaiian has an inventory\nof about 12 to 14 different phonemes,\n14 different consonants and vowels.\nEnglish, on contrast,\nhas about 40 different\nconsonants and vowels.\nSo languages have different inventories.\nThey can overlap for sure,\nbut different languages use\ndifferent sound elements,\ncombine and recombine those elements\nto give rise to different\nwords and meanings.\n- Can we say that there is\na most complicated language\nout there, or among the most complicated?\nWould it be Russian?\n- It's definitely high up there.\nEnglish is up there, too,\nactually. Yeah, German as well.\n- And in terms of learning\nmultiple languages\nduring development,\nmy understanding is that if one\nwants to become bilingual or trilingual,\nbest to learn those\nlanguages simultaneously\nduring development, ideally before age 12,\nif one hopes to not have an\naccent in speaking them later.\nIs that correct, or do\nyou want to revise that?\n- Well, basically, the earlier,\nand the earlier is better,\nthe more intense it is and\nthe more immersive it is,\nthe longer, you know, that\nyou can be exposed to that\nis really important.\nA lot of people can\nget exposed to it early\nand basically lose it.\nEven though it's, quote, unquote,\nduring that sensitive period,\nunless it's maintained, it\ncan be very easily lost.\nThen I think another aspect\nof it that's very interesting\nis some of the social\nrequirements for it too.\nIt's pretty clear that\nyou can only go so far\njust listening to these\nsounds from a tape recording\nor something like that.\nThere's something extra\nabout real human interactions\nthat activates the brain's sensitivity\nto different speech sounds\nand allows us to become\nspecialized for them\nfor a given language.\n- So returning to what's mapped,\nwhat the representations are in the brain,\nI'm starting to get a picture now\nbased on these plosives\nand these tha sounds.\nAnd what I find so interesting\nand logical about that\nis it maps to the motor structures\nand the actual\npronunciation of the sounds,\nnot necessarily to the meaning\nof the individual words.\nNow, of course, it's\nrelated to the meaning\nof the individual words,\nbut it makes good sense to me\nwhy something as complex as language,\nboth to understand and to generate,\nwould map to something that\nis essentially motor in design\nbecause, as you point out, I\nhave to generate these sounds\nand I have to hear them\ngenerated from others.\nHowever, there's reading\nand there's writing,\nand writing is certainly motor,\nreading involves some motor commands\nof the eyes and et cetera.\nWhere do reading and writing\ncome into this picture?\nAre they in parallel with, as\nwe would say in neuroscience,\nor are they embedded\nwithin the same structures?\nAre they part of the same\nseries of computations?\n- Yeah, so to address the first part\nis that we've got this map\nof these different parts\nof consonants and vowels,\nand when we look at how they lay out\nin this part of the brain\nthat we call Wernicke's area,\nwe've spent a lot of time\nreally just dissecting this\nmillimeter by millimeter.\nThe term that you used is very apropos.\nIt's salt and pepper. It's not random.\nThere is this kind of selectivity\nto these individual speech sounds.\nAnd one point I want to\nmake about it is this,\nis that in English, for example,\nthere are about 40 different phonemes.\nPhonemes are just consonants or vowels\nor individual speech segments.\nBut these articulatory\nfeatures that you refer to,\nfor example, the characteristic sounds\nthat are generated by specific\nmovements in the mouth,\nyou can more or less reduce that\nto about 12 different features.\nOkay, these are specific\nmovements of the tongue,\nthe jaw, the lips, the larynx.\nThere are about 12 of these movements,\nand just like you said, Andrew,\nby themselves, they have no meaning.\nThey're just movements.\nBut what's incredible about it\nis that you take these 12 movements\nand you put them in combinations\nand you start putting them in sequence.\nWe as humans use those 12 set features\nto generate all words.\nAnd because we can generate\nnearly an infinite number of words\nwith that code of just 12 features,\nwe have something\nthat generates essentially\nall possible meaning\nbecause that's what we do as\nhumans, we generate meanings,\nI'm trying to communicate\none idea to another,\nwhich, to me, is extraordinary.\nA parallel would be, for example, DNA.\nThere's four base pairs in DNA,\nbut with those four base\npairs in a specific sequence\ncan generate an entire code for life.\nAnd speech is the same way.\nIt's like you've got\nthese fundamental elements\nthat, by themselves, have no meaning,\nbut when you put them together\ngive rise to every possible meaning.\nSo with regard to your second point\nabout reading and writing,\nit's a fascinating question.\nSpeech and language is part\nof who we are as humans.\nThat's part of how we evolved,\nand it's hardwired\nand, you know, molded by experience.\nReading and writing are a human invention.\nIt's something that was added on\nto the architecture of the brain.\nAnd because reading and writing\nare fairly recent in human evolution,\nit's essentially too quick\nfor anything to, like,\nhave a dramatic change\nin, let's say, a new brain area\nor some kind of specialization.\nInstead, what happens is that\nwhenever any kind of behavior\nbecomes ultra specialized in\nany of us or any organism,\nwe can sort of take some areas\nthat are normally involved\nwith vision, for example,\nand specialize it for\nthe purpose of reading.\nSo all of us have a part of our brain\nin the back of the temporal lobe\nthat interfaces with the\noccipital visual cortex\nthat we call a visual word form area.\nThere's actually a part of the\nbrain that is very sensitive\nto seeing words, like,\neither typed or handwritten.\nThere's a part of the brain\nthat also is sensitive\nto seeing things like faces.\nSo these are things\nthat are all conditioned\non what's important, you know, to survive.\nSo reading and writing are an invention,\nand there are things that have mapped\nto functions that the brain already has.\nAnd one of the really important things\nabout reading and writing\nis that when we learn to read and write,\nespecially with the reading part,\nit maps to the part of the brain\nthat we've been talking about,\nwhich is the part that's\nprocessing speech sounds.\nSo some of us kind of think about it,\nthese are two different things.\nOne is hearing sounds through your ears,\nthe other is reading\nwhere you're actually seeing\nthings through your eyes\nand then getting into the language system.\nWell, it turns out that\nthe auditory speech cortex\nis the primal and\nprimitive fundamental area\nthat's really important for speech,\nand what happens with the reading\nis once it gets through\nthat visual cortex,\nit's going to try to map\nthose reading signals\nto the part of the brain\nthat's trying to make sense of sounds,\nthe sounds of words,\nwhat we call phonology.\nNow, why is this important?\nIt has a lot of relevance\nto how we learn to write.\nAnd in some kids with dyslexia...\nDyslexia is a neurological condition\nwhere a child, in some cases, an adult,\nhas trouble reading, for example.\nAnd in many of those cases,\nit's because that mapping\nbetween how we see the words\nto the way that the brain\nprocesses the sounds\nis something different,\nit's a little bit different\nthan people who can read really well.\nSo when you're reading, a lot of times,\nyou're actually activating\nthe part of the brain\nthat is processing the\nwords that you hear.\n- What is the current\ntreatment for dyslexia?\nI've heard that it's a deficit\nin some of the motion processing systems\nof the visual system.\nYou know, people, their eyes are jumping\nas opposed to more linear reading across,\nor I suppose if it were\nChinese it would be...\nYou know, I don't want to presume\npeople are always reading English.\nOr I suppose if it's Hebrew,\nthey're going from the\nopposite side of the page.\nWhat can be done for dyslexia?\nAnd do any of the modern\ntreatments for dyslexia\ninvolve changing things\nfrom the speech side\nas opposed to just the,\nquote, unquote, reading side,\ngiven that speech and\nreading are interconnected?\n- Yeah, absolutely.\nSo, again, I think in the beginning,\npeople might have thought\nthis was purely a visual abstraction\nor something really just\nabout the visual system,\nbut there's been more recognition\nthat it could be both\nor it could be either,\ndepending on the particular instance.\nIt's very clear that there\nare many kids with dyslexia\nwhere the problem is a problem\nof a phonological awareness.\nSo, you know, it can\nbe very hard to detect\nbecause they may understand\nthe words that you were saying,\nbut because the brain is so\ngood at pattern recognition,\nsometimes even if the\nindividual speech sounds\nare not crystal clear,\nit can compensate that,\nso that you can have an\nindividual who can hear the words\nbut not be able to essentially hear them\nwhen they're reading those same words.\nAnd so what can happen with that\nis that you can have this disconnection\nbetween what they're seeing\nand what they need in\norder to hear it as words\nand process it as language.\nAnd so skilled readers\nusually need that route first.\nThey've got to map the vision to the sound\nin order to get that\nsort of like foundation.\nBut then over time, the reading\nhas its direct connection\nto the language parts of the brain,\nand we don't necessarily\nalways need to map to sounds.\nYou know, you can basically\ndevelop a parallel route,\nand we, as readers, actually\nuse both all the time.\nSo for example, if it's a new word\nthat you've never seen before,\nsometimes you try to, like,\npronounce it in your mind,\nyou know, and try to\nhear what that word is.\nEven though you're not actually saying it,\nyou're trying to just generate\nwhat those sounds might be like.\nAnd that's the part where\nwe're kind of relying\non how we learn to read\nin the first place,\nwhich is mapping those word images\nto the sounds that, you\nknow, go along with them.\nBut in other times, if you're\na really proficient reader,\nyou're just seeing the words\nand you can map them directly to meaning\nwithout having to go through that process.\n- Yeah, I'm a big fan of\nlistening to audiobooks,\nand of course I also listen\nto podcasts quite a lot,\nbut I also am a strong believer,\nbased on the research that I've seen,\nthat reading books, physical books,\nit could be on a Kindle, I suppose,\nbut reading a physical book is useful\nfor being able to articulate\nwell and structure sentences\nand build what are essentially paragraphs,\nwhich is what I'm required to do\nwhen I do solo episodes of the podcast.\nI've noticed over the years\nas text messaging has become more popular\nand there's essentially\nan erosion of punctuation\nor the need to have complete sentences,\nand now that's sort of\ntransferred to email as well.\nIt's become acceptable\nto just say, you know,\nfragmented sentences in email.\nIt seems likely that\nit's starting to impact\nthe way that people speak as well.\nAnd I don't think this has\nanything to do with intelligence\nor education level,\nbut are you aware of any evidence\nthat how we read and what we read\nand whether or not we consume information\npurely through reading or\nmainly through auditory sources,\ndoes it change the way that we speak?\nBecause, after all,\nWernicke's and Broca's area\nand the other auditory and\nspeech production areas\nare heavily intermeshed,\nand so it would make perfect\nsense to me that what we hear\nand the patterns of sound that\nare being communicated to us\nwould also change the way that we speak.\n- Yeah, that's a really fascinating point.\nThere is this idea\nthat there's, like, this\nproper way to speak,\nlike that there's the\nright way, for example,\nwhat are the appropriate, you know...\nLike, for example, in school,\nyou're oftentimes told, like,\n\"You should say it like this,\nnot say it like that,\" you know?\nAnd every language kind of has that.\nIt turns out that that's really unnatural.\nLanguages, and speech in\nparticular, change over time,\nit evolves, and it can\nhappen very quickly.\nYou know, the things that we\ncall dialects, for example,\nare just different ways of speaking,\nand someone can just be in one environment\nand change from one dialect to another,\nand some people, it\nkind of is really fixed.\nAnd there is this idea that,\nyou know, like in school\nthat we're told that\nthere's this right way,\nbut in reality, that's not true.\nLike, language change and speech change\nis completely normal and\nhappens all the time,\nand it can be really dramatic.\nLike, certain cultures and communities,\nif they are isolated,\nthey can develop a whole new language,\na whole new set of words, for example,\nand new ways and dialects that\nare independent from people\nto the point where it's\nunintelligible even to others.\nAnd so the basic idea is that sound change\nis part of the way it works,\nand the brain is very sensitive\nto those kind of changes.\n- Speaking of learning new languages,\nI'm assuming it's possible\nto learn new languages\nthroughout the lifespan, correct?\n- [Eddie] Yeah.\n- I've also heard these\nkind of fantastical stories\nof somebody has a stroke\nand then suddenly, spontaneously,\ncan speak French fluently,\nwhereas prior to the\nstroke, they could not.\nIs there any merit to\nthose stories whatsoever?\n[Eddie laughs]\nI find it very hard to believe\nthat there was a complete\nmap representation\nof a language in somebody's brain\nthat they were completely unaware of,\nand then because of\ndamage to a brain area,\nthat capacity to speak that\nlanguage was somehow unveiled.\nIt just seems too wild,\nand I don't want to say good to be true\nbecause nobody wants a stroke,\nbut it just seems out\noutrageously implausible.\n- Well, there are aspects of that\nthat certainly are implausible.\nSo I don't know of any true\ncase that I've ever seen\nor experienced myself or even read about\nwhere, for example, there\nwas an injury to the brain\nthat resulted in loss of,\nwell, essentially a gain of function,\nmeaning, like, just all of a sudden\nstarted speaking another language.\nSo for example, if you had a stroke\nand you never spoke French,\nand then you had it\nand then all of a sudden you're speaking,\nthat, I've never heard of and never seen.\nHowever, there is a condition\nthat is well acknowledged\nand I have seen one case of this\ncalled a foreign accent syndrome,\nwhich is peculiar because there are people\nwho have an injury to\nthe part of the brain\nwhere it sounds like they're starting\nto speak this other language,\nbut they're not actually\nspeaking the language,\nit just sounds like it.\nAnd this goes back to what\nwe were talking about earlier\nabout these areas that\nare really important\nfor speech control of the vocal tract,\nthis area in the precentral gyrus.\nPeople have documented\nwhere, you know, patients\nhave had strokes there,\nand after that, it sounds\nlike they're speaking Spanish\nas opposed to English\nor it sounds like they have\nthe intonational properties\nof French or Russian\nas compared to their\noriginal native language.\nThey're not learning all the rest of it,\nlike the meaning and\nthe grammar, et cetera,\nbut they're adopting\nsome of the phonology,\nand part of that is just\nbecause it's not working\nthe way it normally does.\nSo there is something\nactually called a foreign accent syndrome\nthat people can have after a stroke.\n- Interesting. I'm curious\nabout auditory memory.\nWhen I was a kid, I used\nto get into bed at night,\nand I'd close my eyes and I\nwould replay conversations\nthat I had heard during\nthe day or people's voices.\nI actually can remember calling your house\nwhen we were young kids,\nand because I don't speak any Chinese\nbut I'd have to ask for you,\nI'd say, I think it was,\nEddie [speaking Chinese].\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, and then whoever\nanswered the phone\nwould go get you, and then\nI'd say [speaking Chinese],\nwhich I believe means thank you, right?\nThat's the total of the Chinese\nthat I speak, by the way,\nbut I will never forget that.\nI'll just never forget it, I hope.\nI suppose if I have a stroke\nor something of that sort,\nat some point, I'll forget it\nand I won't know that I've forgotten it.\nBut in all seriousness, I\nremember that to this day.\nI couldn't spell that\nout, I wouldn't know how,\ncertainly not in Chinese,\nbut even a transliteration,\nI couldn't do using English letters.\nWhere are memories of sounds stored?\nBecause within our days\nand across our lives,\nwe have an infinite number\nof auditory experiences,\njust like we have an infinite\nnumber of visual experiences.\nWhere are they stored,\nand what is the structure\nof their storage?\nWhat am I calling upon,\nbesides, of course, the motor commands\nthat are required to say\nwhat I just said in Chinese,\nwhich I won't repeat again,\n'cause I somehow managed to\nget it right the first time,\nor at least not terribly wrong,\nthen I don't want to\nbotch it the second time.\nWhere is that stored,\nand how does that work?\nAnd, more importantly,\nas I speak my native language, English,\nam I pulling from a memory bank?\nBecause it doesn't feel like it.\nI'm just telling you what I want to say.\nI'm doing my best to communicate\nclearly and succinctly.\nI'm usually not so good\nat the succinct part.\nBut where is the bank of information?\nOn my keyboard on my\ncomputer, I have the letters,\nand I have certain elements\nof punctuation and the space.\nWhat am I pulling from? Am I\npulling from those plosives?\nBut if so, how can I do it so quickly?\nEven for people that speak slowly,\nit appears more or less fluid.\nThis, to me, is overwhelmingly impressive\nthat the brain can do that.\nHow does it do that?\n- Well, first of all,\nI am impressed that 35\nyears later... [laughs]\n- Well, I had to get\nahold of you. [laughs]\n- Yeah, so I am impressed, 35 years later,\nthat you can still remember that.\n- But only that.\n- That's fine, but I'm\nstill very impressed.\nBut it clearly was\nsomething important to you.\nSo the short answer is that\nmemory is very distributed.\nSo it's almost like the\nquestion that you asked me\nis ill posed 'cause you asked me where?\nWell, it's not one specific area.\nIt's actually really distributed.\nIt's not just one particular area.\nIn fact, I'm fairly certain\nthat if we were to injure\nthat part of the brain\ncalled the Wernicke's area,\nyou may still even have memories of that.\nPeople can have injuries of Broca's area\nor certainly the precentral gyrus\nand be able to sing \"Happy\nBirthday,\" for example,\nwhen it's embedded in melody\nor highly rehearsed things like counting\ndespite not being able to speak,\nwhich is incredible, right?\nIt's like you can see a patient,\nfor example, who can't really\nput together a sentence.\nYou ask them, \"How are you feeling today?\"\nAnd they can't even utter a word.\nBut then you ask them to count sometimes,\nand they'll get up to any number really.\nAnd so there are some things\nthat are really built\ninto our motor memory\nand it's distributed.\nIt's not one particular part of the brain,\nit's actually multiple areas\nwhere that memory is distributed.\nAnd thank God that's the way it is\nbecause it's very rare\nin the kind of surgeries that I do\nwhere you go in, you remove\na piece of the brain,\nthat someone forgets these\nkind of long-term memories\nor these long-term motor\nskills that they have.\nThat's very, very rare.\nIt's the number one question\na patient will ask me,\nlike, \"Am I going to be the same?\nAnd am I going to remember,\nyou know, my wife?\nOr am I going to remember,\nyou know, these thoughts of my birthday\nwhen I was 10 years old?\"\nAnd I've never really seen\nthat kind of severe amnesia\nunless it's a very, very severe injury\nthat involves almost the\nentire brain, and thank God.\nSo a lot of that information\nis really distributed\nacross the entire brain.\n- Speaking of storage\nof and ability to speak,\nyou are doing some amazing work\nand have achieved some pretty incredible,\nwell-deserved recognition for your work\nin bringing language\nout of paralyzed people,\nessentially allowing people\nwho are locked into a paralyzed state\nor otherwise unable to articulate speech\nusing brain-machine interfaces,\nessentially translating\nthe neural activity\nof areas of the brain\nthat would produce speech\ninto hardware,\nwires and things of that sort,\nartificial, non-biological tools\nin order to allow paralyzed\npeople to communicate.\nWe will provide a link\nto some of the popular\npress coverage of that work\nand the original papers.\nBut if you would be so kind\nas to tell us what those\nexperiments look like,\nwho these people are who are locked in\nand that you allow to communicate,\nand then especially interesting to me,\nsome of the directions that\nyou're taking this now,\nwhich is beyond just, you know,\npeople being able to think\nabout what they want to say\nand words coming out on a\nscreen or through a microphone,\nbut actually making the interactions\nbetween these people and the real world\nmore elaborate and more real.\nIf that seems mysterious to people,\nI'm going to let Eddie tell you\nwhat they're doing with this\nrather than put any more detail on it.\n- Oh, okay. Well, thanks\nfor asking about this.\nThis has really been some\nof the exciting recent work\nfrom the lab.\nSo for the last decade,\nwe've really been focusing\non the basic science,\nmeaning trying to understand\nhow the brain extracts and\nproduces speech sounds and words.\nWe've done a lot of work\ntrying to figure out\nhow these parts of the brain\ncontrol these individual elements\nthat give rise to all words and meanings.\nAnd so it was about six years ago\nwhere we realized we actually\nhave a pretty good idea\nof how this code works.\nWe had identified all of\nthese different elements\nthat we could decode in\nepilepsy patients, for example,\nwhen they had electrodes on the brain\nas part of their surgeries,\nwe could decode all of\nthe different consonants\nand vowels of English.\nThat was about six years ago.\nSo a natural question was this,\nwhich is if we understand\nthat electrical code,\ncan we use that to help\nsomeone who is paralyzed\nand can't get those\nsignals out of the brain\nto speak normally?\nAnd that's in the setting\nof people who are paralyzed.\nSo there are a series of conditions,\nthey include things\nlike brain stem stroke.\nThe brain stem is the part of the brain\nthat connects the cerebrum,\nwhich is the top part,\ndoes our thinking and a\nlot of the motor control,\nspeech, language, everything,\nand the brain stem is what connects that\nto the spinal cord and the nerves\nthat go out to the face and vocal tract.\nSo if you have a stroke there,\nbasically, you could be\nthinking all the wild, creative,\nintelligent thoughts you have\nin the mind and the cerebrum,\nbut you can't get them out into words\nor you can't get them out to\nyour hand to write them down.\nSo that's a very severe form of paralysis\ncalled brain stem stroke.\nThere's another kind of conditions\nthat we call neurodegenerative\nwhere the nerve cells die\nbasically, or atrophy,\nin a condition called ALS,\nand that's a very severe\nform of paralysis.\nIn its extreme form,\npeople essentially lose\nall voluntary movement.\n- So Stephen Hawking\nwould be a good example\nof someone with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease?\n- He's an example of someone who had ALS\nbut not a great example of\nwhat typical course of ALS.\nSo for reasons not clear,\nthe progression of his\ndisease largely stabilized\nto the point where he could\ntwitch, you know, a cheek muscle\nor move his eyes, let's say.\nIn most people, it's very rapid,\nand many people, they\ndie from it, actually,\nyou know, within a couple\nof years of diagnosis, so-\n- Yeah, he lived a long time in that-\n- He lived a long time-\n- That slanted-over state\nin his wheelchair.\n- Right, exactly.\nBut he wasn't breathing,\nyou know, through a tube\nin his throat, for example,\nbecause people with severe ALS,\nthe muscles to their\ndiaphragm and their lungs\nessentially give out as well.\nThey get weakness there and\nthen they can't breathe anymore.\nSo that's another form of paralysis.\nAnd so in our field,\nthese are kind of like the\nmost devastating things\nthat can happen.\nI'm not going to really try to\ncompare, like, what's worse,\nyou know, having a brain tumor\nor a stroke, it's all bad.\nBut this condition of what\nwe call being locked in\nrefers to this idea\nthat you can have\ncompletely intact cognition\nand awareness but have\nno way to express that,\nno voluntary movement,\nno ability to speak.\nAnd that is devastating\nbecause psychologically and socially,\nyou know, you're completely isolated.\nThat's what we call locked-in syndrome,\nand it's devastating.\nI've seen that throughout my career,\nand it's really heartbreaking\nbecause you know that the person is there\nbut you can't see, they can't communicate.\nSo we've been studying this patterning\nof electrical activity\nfor consonants and vowels,\nand essentially, once we\nfigured out a lot of these codes\nfor the individual phonetic elements,\nwe took a little bit of a detour,\nor at least part of the lab\nstarted to focus on this\nvery specific question.\nFor people who have\nthese kind of paralysis,\ncould we intercept those signals\nfrom the brain, the cerebral cortex,\nas someone is trying to say those words,\nand then can we intercept them\nand then have them taken out\nof the brain through wires\nto a computer that are going\nto interpret those signals\nand translate them into words?\nSo about three years ago,\nwe started a clinical trial.\nIt's called the BRAVO\ntrial. It's still underway.\nAnd the first participant\nin the BRAVO trial\nwas a man who had been\nparalyzed for 15 years.\nWhen he was about 20 years old,\nhe came to the United States,\nwas actually working in the Sonoma area\nand he was in a car accident,\nand he actually walked out of the hospital\nday after that car accident,\nbut the next day, had a\ncomplication related to it\nwhere he had a very large\nstroke in the brain stem,\nand that turned out to be devastating.\nHe didn't wake up from that\nstroke for about a week.\nHe was in a coma for about a week.\nAnd when he woke up from that coma,\nhe realized that he couldn't\nspeak or move his arms or legs.\nAnd as he told me or communicated to us,\nthat was absolutely devastating.\nHe wanted really to die at that time.\n- Could he blink his eyes or\nmove his mouth in any way?\n- He could blink his eyes,\nhe had some limited mouth movements\nbut couldn't produce\nany intelligible speech.\nIt was, like, completely\nslurred and incomprehensible.\nAnd he survived this injury.\nA lot of people who\nhave that kind of stroke\njust don't survive.\nBut he survived.\nAnd I also realized that he's\njust an incredible person,\nlike a force of nature\nin terms of his optimism,\nin terms of his ability to make friends\ndespite his condition.\nThe way he actually communicates,\nbecause he has a little bit\nof residual neck movements,\nis that he improvised and had his friends\nbasically put a stick\nattached to his baseball cap.\nAnd because he could move his neck,\nhe would essentially type out\nletters on a keyboard screen\nto get out words.\nIn fact, this is how he\ncommunicated was through a device\nthat he would essentially\npeck out letters one by one\nby moving his neck\nto control this stick\nattached to his baseball cap.\n- How many years did he use\nthat method of communication?\n- [Eddie] For about 15 years.\nHe hadn't really spoken\nfor about 15 years.\n- Oh, goodness.\n- Yeah. So it was a devastating injury.\nBut, you know, there's\nsomething to be said\nabout the human spirit,\nand if there's anyone who\nembodies it, it is Pancho,\nthat's his nickname, the first\nparticipant in our trial.\nHe has that human spirit, he persevered,\nand, in fact, you know, could thrive\nin his community, basically, and friends,\nbeing able to communicate\nin this very slow and inefficient way.\nMaybe part of that spirit\nis why he volunteered\nto be the first person in this trial.\nIt was a clinical trial, an\nexperiment. It was a study.\nThis is not an approved\ntherapy by any means.\nThis was really something\nthat had not been done before,\nand we had a lot of ideas\nabout it, but we didn't know.\nYou know, we had proven a\nlot of this could be true\nin some people who are normally speaking,\nbut to actually put it into\nsomeone who's paralyzed,\nnumber one, where we don't\nknow the code is the same.\nNumber two is someone who's\nnot been speaking for 15 years,\nwhether those signals are\nactually still there or not.\nSo it was part of a clinical trial.\nIt was, you know,\nsomething that our hospital\nand also the FDA, you know, had to approve\nand looked at very carefully,\nbut given a lot of the\nwork that we had done,\nthere was some basis\nfor why this might work.\nAnd so about two and a half years ago,\nwe did a surgery where\nwe implanted electrodes\nonto the parts of the brain\nthat we've been talking about,\nthese areas that control the vocal tract,\nthe areas that control the larynx,\nthe areas that control the lips\nand tongue and jaw movements\nwhen we normally speak.\nThese are areas that\npresumably may be active,\nthat was our hope, in his brain,\nbut he just couldn't get those out\nto control his mouth in a normal way.\nAnd he underwent a surgery,\na brain surgery where we\nput an electrode array\nand we connected it to a port\nthat was screwed to his skull.\nAnd the port actually\ngoes through his scalp,\nand he's lived with this now\nfor the last three years.\nIt is a risk of infection.\nThese ports eventually\nhave to become wireless\nin the future.\nBut we've figured out a\nway to keep that port there\nwhere we can essentially\nconnect him to a computer\nthrough that port.\nSo he has an electrode\narray that's implanted\nover the part of his brain\nthat's important for speech,\nit's connected to a port,\nand then we connect a wire\nto that port that translates\nthose what we call analog,\nyou know, brainwaves\nand converts them into digital signals.\nAnd then a computer takes\nthose digital signals\nfrom those individual sites\nfrom the speech cortex\nand translates those into words.\n- Can you describe for us the\nfirst time that Pancho spoke\nthrough this engineered device?\nWhat was that experience like for you?\nAnd, at least from what\nhe conveyed to you,\nwhat was that experience like for him?\nBecause as somebody who\nwas essentially locked-in,\nexcept for this, you know,\nrather crude pecking device,\nalthough I'm thoroughly\nimpressed by how adaptive\nor adaptable Pancho was,\nand his friends engineering\nthat device for him\nis really nothing short of clever\nbecause otherwise he would\nbe truly locked in, right?\nBut what was that moment\nlike? I can only imagine.\n- That moment was incredible.\nIt was truly incredible\nto be able to see him\ntry to get out a word\nthat was, for all practical\npurposes, unintelligible,\nbut to be able to take the brain activity\nand to translate it into text on a screen.\nAnd that's what we did.\nWe took those brainwaves,\nwe put them through a machine learning\nor artificial intelligence algorithm\nthat can pick up these\nvery, very subtle patterns,\nyou can't actually see them with your eye,\nin the brain activity and\ntranslate those into words.\nAnd I remember seeing this\nhappening for the first time.\nYou know, it doesn't\nhappen, like, immediately.\nThis is something that took\nweeks to train the algorithm\nto interpret it correctly.\nBut what was incredible about\nit was to see how he reacted.\nAnd he would be prompted\nto say a given word,\nlike, you know, outside, for example,\nand then he would think\nabout it, try to say it,\nand finally those words\nwould appear on the screen.\nAnd what was really amazing about it\nwas you could really tell\nthat he, like, got a kick out of that\nbecause he would start to giggle,\nyou know, his body would shake in a way\nand his head would shake in a way\nthat he would start to giggle,\nand that was cool to see.\nBut then I also realized\nthat when he was giggling,\nit kind of screwed up\nthe next word's decoding.\n[Andrew laughs]\n[Eddie laughs]\n- Is that a bug you've since fixed?\n- No, we haven't fixed that.\n- Interesting.\n- We haven't fixed that,\nso it's easier just to\ntell him to stop giggling.\n[Andrew laughs]\n[Eddie laughs]\n- So what was the first word that he said?\n- Well, I think one of the first sentences\nthat he put together\nwas, you know, can you\nget my family outside?\n- Meaning get them out\nof the room? [laughs]\n- [Eddie] No, no.\n- All these years, he wanted\nto get away from his family?\n- No, I think what he meant\nwas, can you get them-\n- Bring them in, yeah.\n- Bring them in.\nAnd so the way this worked\nwas we trained this computer\nto recognize 50 words.\nWe started with a very small vocabulary\nthat's expanding as we speak.\nI think that this is just a matter of time\nbefore these vocabularies\nbecome much, much larger.\nBut we started with a 50-set of words.\nWe created essentially\nall the possible sentences\nthat you could generate\nfrom those 50 words.\nWhy that was important\nwas you can use all\nthose possible sentences\nto create a computational\nmodel, computer model\nof all the different word combinations\nto give different sentences\ngiven those 50 words,\nand then you can essentially\ndo what we call autocorrect.\nIt's the same kind of thing that we do\nwhen you're texting, for example.\nYou get the wrong letter in there,\nbut your phone actually knows,\nyou know, because of its\ncontext what to correct it.\nSo because the decoding's not\n100% correct all the time,\nin fact, it's far from that,\nit's really helpful\nto have these other\nfeatures like autocorrect,\nthe stuff that we use\nroutinely now with texting\nthat makes it correct and then updates it.\nSo it's a combination of a lot of things.\nIt's the AI that is translating\nthose brain activity patterns,\nbut it's also things that we've learned\nfrom speech and speech technologies\nthat, you know, we put all together\nand then all of a sudden,\nit starts to work.\nAnd so we were really excited\nbecause that was the first\ntime that someone was paralyzed\nand could create words and sentences\nthat was just decoded\nfrom the brain activity.\n- Incredible, and I\nknow you're very humble,\nbut I'm going to embarrass you by saying\nI always knew you were\ndestined for great things\nsince the early age of nine\nwhen we first became friends.\nBut when I read the news\ncoverage of your work with Pancho\nand the release of this language\nfrom this locked-in patient,\nit literally, you know, it\nbrought tears to my eyes\nbecause, you know, it's\nan interesting thing\nas fellow neuroscientists, right,\nwe explore the brain and\nwe try and find mechanisms,\nand we try and compare those\nto what other people find\nand find truths and principles\nand build up from those,\nbut pretty rarely is there a case\nwhere that route of exploration\nleads to something of\nclinical significance\nwithin one's own lifetime.\nI mean, that's the reality of science,\nand oftentimes it's a\nvery distributed process.\nBut in this case, it's\nbeen a magnificent thing\nto see you move along this trajectory\nparsing these language and speech areas\nand then to also do the\nclinical work in parallel.\nSpeaking of which, these days,\nwe hear a lot about Neuralink,\nElon Musk's company.\nA neurosurgeon that came\nup briefly through my lab,\nbut I can't take any credit\nfor what he knows or does,\nwhich is Matt MacDougall is\nthe neurosurgeon at Neuralink.\nThere's some other excellent\nneuroscientists there\nand engineers there.\nWe hear a lot about Neuralink\nbecause while brain-machine interface\nof the sort that you do and\nthat other laboratories do\nhas been going on for a long time,\nthere's been some press around Neuralink\nabout the promise of what\nbrain-machine interface could do.\nFor instance, early in our discussion,\nyou talked about how, you\nknow, language is constrained\nby these sound waves,\nand typically, it's a\nfew people communicating\nor one person with many people\nthrough a podcast, for\ninstance, or a speech.\nBut the idea has been thrown out there\nthat through the use of stimulating chips\nor through other brain-machine devicing\nthat perhaps one could internalize\n50 conversations in parallel, right?\n50X communication,\nor that the memory\nsystems could be augmented\nto remember 10 times as much information\nor even twice as much information\nin a given period of time.\nMy understanding of what\nthey're doing at Neuralink,\nwhich is admittedly crude\nand from the outside,\na few discussions with people there,\nis that they too are going to\npursue clinical goals first,\nthings like trying to\ngenerate smooth movement\nin a Parkinsonian patient,\ntrying to adjust movement patterns\nin someone with Huntington's\ndisease, for instance,\nthings of that sort\nbefore they embark on the\nmore sci-fi-like explorations\nof 50Xing communication or\ndoubling memory capacity\nand these kinds of things.\nAlthough, I don't know,\nthey may be doing all of\nthose things in parallel.\nWhat are your thoughts about\nsuper capabilities of the brain\nor, I don't even know what word to use,\nyou know, supercharging the brain,\nyou know, giving the brain functions\nfor which we've never observed before\nin human history, right?\nWe have our Einsteins and our\nFeynmans and our Merzenichs\nand, you know, it's unclear\nwho to put in along\nthat line side by side,\nbut there are some, the\nMichael Jordans and et cetera,\nbut we've never heard of or seen somebody\nwho can jump 20 feet in the air.\nOr we've heard of people who\nhave photographic memories,\nbut I don't know that we are aware\nof any human being in history\nwho could memorize the\nentire Library of Congress\nor all the works within\nthe Vatican within an hour.\nAnyway, you get the idea.\nWhat are your thoughts about\nmanipulating neural circuitry\nto achieve suprahuman or superhuman\nor supraphysiological functions?\nAre we there, or should we\neven be thinking about that?\nIs it possible given that\nneurons simply communicate\nthrough electrical activity\nand electrical activity can be engineered\noutside of the brain?\nHow do you think about it?\nAnd here, we don't even have to think\nabout Neuralink in particular.\nIt's just but one example of companies\nand people in laboratories\nthat are quite understandably\nconsidering all this.\n- Well, it's a really\ninteresting time right now.\nThe science has been going on for decades.\nThe work that we've done\nin this field that you call\nbrain-machine interface\nhas been going on for a while.\nAnd a lot of the early work\nwas just trying to restore\nthings like arm movement\nor having people or monkeys\ncontrol a computer cursor,\nfor example, on the screen.\nThat's been going on for decades.\nWhat's been really new is\nthat industry is now involved\nand some of this is now\nbecoming commercialized,\nand we're starting to see us\nnow cross over to this field\nwhere it's no longer just research,\nthat we're talking about medical\nproducts that are designed\nto be, you know, surgically\nimplanted in some cases.\nYou know, there's people\ndoing this kind of work\nnon-invasively as well\nthat don't require surgery.\nThe specific question\nthat you are asking about\nis an area that we call augmentation.\nSo can you build a device\nthat essentially enhances\nsomeone's ability\nbeyond supranormal, super memory,\nsuper communication speeds\nbeyond speech, for example,\nI guess superior precision\nathletic abilities?\nI think that these are very\nserious kind of questions\nto be asking now\nbecause, as you mentioned,\nthe pathway so far\nis really to focus on\nthese medical applications.\nI personally don't think that\nwe've thought enough actually\nabout what these kind of\nscenarios are going to look like,\nand I don't think we've thought through\nall the ethical implications\nof what this means\nfor augmentation in particular.\nThere's part of this\nthat is not new at all.\nHumans throughout history\nhave been doing things\nto augment our function,\ncoffee, nicotine, all kinds of things,\nall kinds of medications that cross over\nfrom medical to consumer.\nThat is everywhere.\nSo the pursuit of augmentation\nor performance or enhancement\nis really not a new thing.\nThe questions really,\nas they relate to\nneurotechnologies, for example,\nhave to do with the invasive nature.\nFor example, if these technologies\nrequire surgery, for example,\nto do something that is not\nfor a medical application.\nAgain, there, that is not\nexactly new territory either.\nPeople do that routinely for\ncosmetic kind of procedures\nfor physical appearance,\nnot necessarily cognitive.\nSo I do think that,\nprovided the technology\ncontinues to emerge the way that it does,\nthat it's going to be around the corner,\nand it probably is not going to be in ways\nthat are super obvious.\nI don't think it's going to be like,\ncan we easily memorize\nevery fact in the world,\nbut in forms that are going\nto be much more incremental\nand maybe more subtle.\nIn many ways, we already have that now.\nLike, for example, you don't\nhave to have a neural interface\nembedded in your brain to get information,\nessentially access to all\ninformation in the world.\nYou just have to have,\nyou know, your iPhone.\nWhether you could do it faster\nthrough a brain interface,\nI definitely wouldn't rule that out.\nBut think about this,\nthat the systems that we have already\nto speak and to communicate\nhave evolved over, you know,\nthousands and millions of years\nand they're supported by neural structures\nthat have bandwidth of\nmillions of neurons.\nThere is no technology\nthat exists right now\nthat people are thinking about\nthat are in commercial forms,\ncertainly not even in research labs,\nthat come anywhere close\nto what has been evolved\nfor those natural purposes.\nSo I'm essentially\nsaying two sides of this,\nwhich is we're already\ngetting into this now,\nthis is not new territory,\nthis topic of augmentation,\nboth physical and cognitive,\nwe've already surpassed that.\nThat's part of what humans do in general.\nBut we are entering this area\nof, like, enhanced cognition,\nthese areas that I think the technology\nis going to be the rate-limiting\nstep in how far it can go,\nand we have not had the full conversations\nabout, number one, is this\nwhat we actually want?\nIs this going to be good for society?\nWho gets access to this technology?\nThese are all things\nthat are going to become\nreal-world problems.\n- There's certainly a lot to consider.\nIn thinking about augmentation\nand another theme that\nI've yet to ask you about\nbut I'm extremely curious about,\nwhich is facial expressions.\nBefore we talk about the relationship\nbetween the musculature\nof the face and language\nand the communication of emotion,\nI'd love for you to, if you\nwould, touch on a little bit\nof what you're doing\nwith patients like Pancho\nto move beyond somebody who's locked in\nbeing able to type out words on a screen\nwith their thoughts.\nThere's a rich array of information\ncontained within the face\nand facial expression.\nAnd while somebody like Pancho\ngoing from having to, you\nknow, be completely locked in\nto being able to peck\nout letters on a keyboard\nto being able to just\nthink of those letters\nand having them spelled out,\nthat's a tremendous set of\nleaps forward towards normalcy.\nIt's still far and away different\nthan Pancho speaking with his mouth,\nwhich I think, knowing some\npeople who are restricted,\nwho are quadriplegic,\nyou know, a lot of what they\nstruggle with in the real world\nis actually a height difference sometimes\nbecause they're seated while\nother people are standing.\nWe don't often think about this,\nbut to always have to look\nup to communicate with people\nis a very different\ninterface in the world.\nThey manage quite well, of course.\nBut could you tell us what you're doing\nin terms of merging the\nbrain-machine interface\nwith extraction of speech signals\nfrom people who are locked-in like Pancho\nwith facial expressions?\n- Sure, yeah.\nWell, like we described\nbefore, progress is being made.\nThe proof of principle is out there\nthat you can decode speech.\nThat will continue to optimize,\nand I'm very confident that\nthat's going to improve\nvery, very quickly in the coming years\nto the point where it's like,\nyou know, not just a small vocabulary,\nbut a large vocabulary\nand at reasonable rates,\nat a level that's going\nto be really helpful.\nI'm very optimistic about that.\nI think it's the right time\nto start really thinking\nabout a broader vision\nof what communication really is.\nSo for example, I'm\nhere with you in person.\nWe could have done this\nvirtually, probably,\nit's pretty easy to do that.\nWe could've recorded this really separate,\nbut there is something\nabout being able to actually\nsee your expressions\nand to understand other\nforms of communication.\nSo another really\nimportant one is nonverbal,\nthe expressions that you're making.\nYou know, for example,\nif you have a quizzical look on your face\nif I'm saying something not clear,\nthat's a sign to me that\nI need to rephrase it\nor to say it in a different way\nor to slow down, for example.\nOr if there's something\nthat really excites you,\nI want to continue to say more about it\nand talk more in detail,\nyou know, essentially about a given thing.\nSo facial expressions actually\nare a really important part\nof the way we speak,\nand there's two things.\nIt's not just the expressions\nof, like, how you're feeling\nand perceiving what I'm saying,\nbut it's also seeing my mouth move\nand your eyes actually\nseeing my mouth move\nand my jaw move in a particular way\nthat actually allows you to\nhear those sounds better.\nSo having both the visual information\nbut also the sounds go into your brain\nis going to improve intelligibility,\nalso make it more natural.\n- And memory for what is spoken?\n- Perhaps.\n- So here's a call for people\nnot just listening to podcasts\nbut watching them and\nlistening to them on YouTube,\nI suppose, if we were to\nsort of translate this\nto the real world.\n- Exactly, exactly.\nAnd the reason why we're\nalso very interested\nin this idea of not just\nhaving text on a screen,\nbut essentially a fully\ncomputer-animated face\nlike an avatar of the\nperson's speech movements\nand their facial expressions\nis going to be a more\ncomplete form of expression.\nNow, you can imagine right now,\nthat might just be someone\nlooking at a computer screen\ninterpreting these signals,\nbut I think the way things are going,\nin the next couple of years,\na lot more of our social\ninteractions, more than even now,\nare going to move into\nthis digital virtual space.\nAnd, of course, most people are thinking\nabout what that means for most consumers,\nbut it also has really\nimportant implications\nfor people who are disabled, right,\nand how are they going\nto participate in that.\nAnd so we are thinking really about,\nfor people like Pancho and\nother people who are paralyzed,\nwhat other forms of BCI can we do\nin order to help improve\ntheir ability to communicate?\nSo one is essentially building\nout more holistic avatars,\nyou know, things that\ncan essentially decode,\nyou know, essentially their expressions\nor the movements associated\nwith their mouth and jaw\nwhen they actually speak to\nimprove that communication.\n- So do you envision a\ntime not too long from now\nwhere instead of tweeting\nout something in text,\nmy avatar will,\nI'll type it out, but my\navatar will just say it,\nit'll be an image of my\navatar saying whatever it is\nI happen to be tweeting at that moment.\n- That's what we're working on, yeah.\nSo I don't think that...\nThat is going to happen and\nit's going to happen soon,\nand there's a lot of progress in that.\nAnd, again, we're just\ntrying to enrich the field,\nyou know, of communication expression\nto make it more normal.\nAnd we actually think that\nhaving that kind of avatar\nis a way of getting feedback\nto people learning how to speak\nthrough a speech neuroprosthetic,\nthat's the device that we call,\nit's a speech neuroprosthetic,\nthat that is going to be\nthe way that can help people\nlearn how to do it the quickest.\nNot necessarily, like, trying to say words\nand having it come on a screen,\nbut actually have people embody,\nfeel like it's part of themselves\nor that they are directly controlling\nthat illustration or animation.\n- This idea of an avatar\nspeaking out what we would otherwise write\nis fascinating to me.\nOn Instagram, I post\nvideos, I don't filter them,\nbut I know there's a lot\nof discussion nowadays\nabout people using filters to\nmake their skin look different\nor the lighting look different,\na lot of filtering and\nalso the use of captions,\nso that essentially what you end up with\nis somewhere between an actual\nraw video of what was spoken\nand an avatar version of it.\n- Yeah.\n- I mean, if the mismatch\nbetween what's spoken\nand what's in the caption\nis too dramatic, then\nit doesn't quite work.\nBut I watch these carefully\nwhen people use captions,\nand oftentimes there's a smoothing\nof what was said into the captions\nso it seems much more\nsuccinct and accurate.\nOftentimes, the reverse is also true\nwhere the caption is inaccurate\nand then it creates this\nkind of jarring mismatch.\nIn any case, I think this\naspect in the clinical realm\nof using an avatar to\nallow people like Pancho\nto essentially be a face\nthat communicates through spoken language\nfrom an avatar that looks like them\nis fascinating and indeed important,\nand I think how avatars\nemerge in social spaces\nis going to be really fascinating.\nI get a lot of questions about stutter.\nI think that for people\nwho have a stutter,\nit is itself anxiety-provoking.\nIs stutter related to anxiety?\nIf one has a stutter, what can they do?\nDoes stutter reflect some\nunderlying neurologic phenomenon\nthat might distinguish\nbetween one kind of stutter and another?\nWhat can people with stutter do\nif they'd like to relieve their stutter?\n- Yeah, great question.\nStutter is a condition\nwhere the words can't come out fluently.\nSo you have all the ideas,\nyou've got the language intact.\nYou know, remember, we\ntalked about this distinction\nbetween language and speech.\nStuttering is a problem of speech, right?\nSo the ideas, the meanings,\nthe grammar, it's all there,\nand people stutter\nbut they can't get the words out fluently.\nSo that's a speech condition,\nand, in particular, it's a condition\nthat affects articulation,\nspecifically about controlling\nthe production of words\nin this really coordinated\nkind of movements\nthat have to happen in the vocal tract\nto produce fluent speech.\nAnd stuttering is a condition\nwhere people have a predisposition to it,\nso there is an aspect of stuttering,\nyou are a stutterer or you're\nnot a stutterer, right?\nBut people who stutter don't\nstutter all the time either,\nso you could be a stutterer\nwho stutters at some times but not others.\nAnd, really, the main link\nbetween stuttering and anxiety\nis that anxiety can provoke\nit and make it worse.\nThat's certainly true,\nbut it's not necessarily\ncaused by anxiety.\nIt can essentially trigger\nit or make it worse,\nbut it's not the cause of it, per se.\nSo the cause of it is\nstill really not clear,\nbut it does have to do with\nthese kind of brain functions\nthat we've been talking about earlier,\nwhich is that in order to\nproduce normal fluent speech,\nwe're not even conscious\nof what is going on\nin our mouths, in our larynx.\nWe're not conscious,\nand if we were, we would\nnot be able to speak\nbecause it's too complex,\nit's too precise.\nIt's something that we\nhave really developed\nthe abilities to do, and\nwe do it naturally, right?\nIt's part of our programming\nand part of what we learn inherently,\nyou know, just through exposure.\nSo stuttering is essentially a breakdown\nat certain times\nin that machinery being able to work\nin a really coordinated way.\nYou can think about, you know,\nthe operations of these areas\nthat are controlling the vocal tract.\nLet's say speech is like a symphony.\nIn order for it to come out normally,\nyou've got to have not\njust one part, the larynx,\nbut the lips, the jaw.\nThey can't be doing their own thing.\nThey have to be very,\nvery precisely activated\nand very, very precisely controlled\nin a way to actually create words.\nAnd so in stuttering,\nthere's a breakdown of that coordination.\n- If somebody has a stutter,\nis it better to address that early in life\nwhen there's still neuroplasticity\nthat is very robust?\nAnd if so, what's the\ntypical route for treatment?\nI have to imagine it's not\nbrain surgery typically.\nI'm guessing there are speech therapists\nthat people can talk to,\nand they can help them work\nout where they're getting stuck\nand the relationship to anxiety.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nI mean, part of it is about that anxiety,\nbut a lot of it really\nhas to do with therapy\nto sort of like work through\nand think of tricks basically\nsometimes to create conditions\nwhere you can actually\nget the words to come out.\nSome forms of stuttering are\nreally initiation problems.\nJust getting started itself is very hard.\nYou want to start with\ninitial vowel or consonant,\nbut it won't emit.\nAnd so a lot of the therapy\nis really just focusing\non, like, how do you\ncreate the conditions,\nyou know, for that to happen?\nThere's another aspect to it\nthat I find very interesting\nis that the feedback,\nessentially, what we hear\nourselves say, for example,\nand every time that I say a word,\nI'm also hearing what I'm saying,\nso that's what we call auditory feedback.\nThat turns out to be very important,\nand sometimes when you change that,\nit can actually change the\namount someone stutters\nfor better or for worse.\nAnd it's giving us a clue that the brain\nis not just focused on\nsending the commands out,\nbut it's also possibly interacting\nwith the part that is hearing the sounds,\nand there's something might\nbe going on in that connection\nthat breaks down when stuttering occurs.\nSo there are individuals\nthat are stutterers\nbut they don't stutter all the time.\nIn those instances,\nthere's something happening\nin those particular moments\nwhere this very, very precise coordination\nneeds to happen in the brain\nin order to get the words out fluently.\n- We've talked a little bit about caffeine\nand why you avoid it.\nBecause your work requires\nsuch precision and calm,\nand, frankly, to me,\nit seems like you're\nrunning a lot of operations,\nno pun intended, in parallel\nwhen you're doing surgery,\nnot just thinking about where\nto direct the instruments,\nbut also thinking like a chess player\nseveral steps down the line\nwhat could happen, what\nif, if-then type thinking.\nWhat are some of the other\npractices and tools that you use\nto put yourself into state\nfor optimal neurosurgery\nor for, you know, thinking\nabout scientific problems\nfor that matter?\nWe keep threatening to\ngo running together,\nbut I know you run, correct?\n- Yeah.\n- Do you find running\nto be an essential part\nof your state regulation?\n- Absolutely, yeah.\nSo for me, most exercise that I do,\nI really don't do for physical reasons.\nI do it for mental reasons.\nI can tell, for example,\nif I don't go on a run or a\nswim just after a day or two,\nand it can have translation,\nfor example, in the way I\nfeel in the operating room\nor even the way I interact\nwith other people.\nSo there's no question\nthat, you know, the mind and\nbody are deeply connected,\nand for me personally,\nbeing able to have opportunity\nto disconnect for a while,\nit turns out to be\nreally, really important.\nNow, the operating room,\nfor me, is another space,\nkind of like running or swimming,\nwhere I'm disconnected\nfrom the rest of the world.\nI don't bring my cell phone\ninto the operating room.\nI'm disconnected from the external world\nfor that time that I'm in the surgery,\nand all I am doing is just focusing.\nNow, that doesn't mean that\nI'm having complex thoughts\nor doing something very complicated.\nSometimes it is like that,\nbut it's not always like that.\nThere are things that we do in surgery\nthat are, like, routine and rote\nand are from muscle memory.\nSo, for example, suturing skin\nor doing certain kinds of dissection\nor drilling part of the bone, for example,\nthese are all things that\nbecome very rote after a time.\nSo, for me, even being\nin the operating room\nactually can sometimes\nfulfill that purpose.\nSo I really look forward to\nbeing in the operating room\nbecause that intense focus\nallows me to sort of disconnect\nfrom all the other things\nthat I'm worrying about,\nyou know, that are happening\nout in the outside world.\nYou know, we all have those\nkind of things that happen,\nand I'm certainly no exception to that.\nBut, strangely, the operating\nroom, for me, is a sanctuary.\nI love being there\nbecause we have some control\nover the environment.\nI know what is there, I know\nthe anatomy of the brain,\nmy motions are going through routines.\nAnd so for me, that's not\nactually very different\nthan going on a run\nand letting my, you know,\nlegs move in specific ways.\nIt's just the same thing for my hands.\n- Do you listen to music\nor audiobooks when you run,\nor are you divorced from\ntechnology when you run?\n- Well, music helps me,\nlike, just stay motivated\nand distracted from being out\nof breath and other things.\nAnd for me, it's a way to just catch up\nwith, like, the world.\nSo sometimes I do, but I do notice\nthat, like, I don't run\nas well, for example.\nIn the operating room,\nit's a little different.\nYou know, different\nsurgeons have preferences.\nI'm more of the camp\nwhere I don't like any\ndistraction whatsoever.\nI like people to be able to\nhear the words that I'm saying\nwithout having background noise.\nI don't really think about\nrelying on music or other things\nto try to put me in a state of mind.\nYou know, I think just being there alone\nand just, you know, trying\nto treat it the way it is,\nit's a sacred moment where someone's life\nis really directly under your hands,\nThat enough kind of\nfocuses me very quickly,\nand I like that.\nIt really detaches me\nfrom a lot of the things\nthat are preoccupying me,\nand for those couple of\nhours that we have a surgery,\nwe're just focused on one thing only.\n- That's fantastic.\nAgain, I think of, in the\nrange of brain explorers,\nthe neurosurgeons, those\nof your profession,\nare, to me, like the\nastronauts of neuroscience\nbecause they're really going\nto the farthest reaches possible,\nand they're testing and probing\nand really at the front edge\nof discovering from the species\nthat we arguably care about\nthe most, which is humans.\nEddie, I have to say,\nfrom the first time we became\nfriends 38 years ago...\n- Something like that.\n- Something like that.\nI'm almost reluctant to say,\nso I only reveal it in part\nthat Eddie and I became friends\nbecause both he and I\nshared a love of birds,\nand we had a club at our school\nof which there were only\ntwo members, Eddie and I.\n- Small club.\n- Small club.\nThere was one honorary member,\nand there were certain\nrequirements for being in this club\nthat we won't reveal.\nWe took a pact of secrecy,\nand we're going to obey\nthat pact of secrecy.\nBut to be sitting here with you today,\nfor me, is a absolute thrill,\nnot just because we've\nbeen friends for that long\nor that we got reacquainted\nthrough literally the halls\nof medicine and science,\nbut because I really do\nsee what you're doing\nas really representing that\nfront, absolute cutting edge\nof exploration and application.\nI mean, the story of Pancho is\nbut one of your many patients\nthat has derived tremendous\nbenefit from your work.\nAnd now as the chair of a department,\nyou, of course, work alongside individuals\nwho are also doing incredible work\nin the spinal cord, et cetera.\nSo on behalf of myself\nand everyone listening,\nI just really want to thank\nyou for joining us today\nto share this information.\nWe will certainly have you back\nbecause there's an entire\nlist of other questions\nwe didn't have time to get to,\nbut also just for the work you\ndo, it's truly spectacular.\n- Andrew, thanks so much.\nYou know, I'm very humbled\nbasically by what you just said,\nand I feel that it's really an\nextraordinary honor actually\nand privilege, you know,\nto be here with you\nand reconnect and talk\nabout all these ideas.\nIt's probably not random,\nyou know, that we ended up in\nsimilar spots and interests.\nI think when we were kids,\nyou know, it starts\nwith some deep interests\nand kind of nerding out on topics,\nand it's probably not a coincidence,\nyou know, that we have such\ndeep interest in this work now.\nI just feel really lucky\nto be able to do what I do.\nIt's fun every day, almost every day,\nbe able to go to work\nand take care of folks\nand learn at the same time\nand then just close the loop,\nyou know, how do we apply the knowledge\nthat we learn one day to\nsomeone who comes in next week?\nIt's really fun.\nAnd we don't know everything,\nwe're not even close to it,\nbut the journey to figure this out,\nit's really extraordinary.\nI mean, it's like you said,\nit's exploring new lands.\nLiterally in the operating room\nwhen I'm looking at the exposed\ncortex trying to understand\nis it safe to walk down this\npart of the cortical landscape\nor this other trail?\nYou know, which one is going to be the one\nthat is going to be safe\nversus the other that results in paralysis\nand inability to talk?\nWell, maybe I shouldn't call it fun,\nbut it's very important, too,\nin addition to being really\nintellectually important\nfor how we understand how the brain works.\nAnd so, yeah, I feel just really lucky\nto be in that opportunity.\n- And we're lucky to have you\nbeing one of the people doing\nit, so thank you ever so much.\n- Thanks.\n- Thank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion
