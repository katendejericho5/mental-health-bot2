    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are discussing fitness.\nFitness, of course,\nis vitally important for\ncardiovascular health,\nfor strength, for endurance,\nfor lifespan, for healthspan.\nI can't think of anyone out\nthere that wouldn't want to\nhave healthy hormonal function,\nhealthy cardiovascular\nfunction, to live a long time\nand to feel vital,\nthat is to have a long healthspan as well\nas a long lifespan.\nFitness and fitness\nprotocols are tremendously\npowerful for developing all of that.\nHowever, despite there\nbeing an enormous amount\nof information out there on\nthe internet and in books\nand elsewhere, it can\nbe a bit overwhelming.\nSo today's episode is really designed\nto synthesize science based\ntools that we've covered\non the podcast, some\nwith expert guests like\nDr. Andy Galpin or Dr.\nPeter Attia, or world\nrenowned Movement specialist Ido Portal,\nor physiotherapist and strength\nand conditioning coach, Jeff Cavaliere.\nWe've had all of them as\nguests on the podcast,\nand each and every one\nof them provided a wealth\nof knowledge in terms\nof the various things\nthat you can do to optimize very specific\nor multiple aspects of fitness.\nToday, we're going to do\nsomething a little bit\ndifferent than usual.\nTypically on the Huberman Lab podcast,\nI offer mechanism upfront or first,\nand then we talk about\nprotocols that you can use\nthat really lean on those science\nand science based mechanisms.\nToday I'm going to describe\na specific protocol\nthat serves as a general\ntemplate that anyone, in fact,\neveryone can use in order to maximize all\naspects of fitness.\nSo that includes endurance,\nstrength, flexibility,\nhypertrophy, aesthetic changes, et cetera.\nHowever, this general\nframework can also be modified,\nthat is customized to\nyour particular needs.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho really wants to build\nmore strength or bigger muscles,\nyou can change the\nprotocol and the overall\nprogram according to that.\nAnd I'll talk about very\nspecific ways to do that.\nOr if you're somebody\nwho really just wants\nto maintain strength, but\nyou want to build endurance,\nwe'll talk about that.\nAnd of course, we will\ncover real life issues,\nsuch as should you train\nif you are sleep deprived,\nwhat about food?\nWhen should you eat?\nWhat if you haven't\neaten and you're hungry?\nShould you still train?\nEt cetera, et cetera.\nWe're going to cover all of that, again,\nin the context of this,\nwhat I would call foundational\ntemplate of fitness.\nNow, this foundational template of fitness\nis something that I personally use.\nIn fact, I've used it\nfor over three decades,\nhard to believe that I'm that old,\nbut I just recently\nturned 47, and I still use\nthis basic protocol or\ntemplate across the week\nand modify it according to\nwhat my particular goals\nare that year, that month, even that day,\nbecause I, like you,\nlive in the real world\nand sometimes I've been traveling\nor I miss a workout, yes,\nit does happen, or life\nisn't organized in exactly\nthe way that I need to in\norder to have everything\ngo according to the\nprotocol that's on paper.\nSo we're going to\ndiscuss real world issues\nand how to work with the\nreal world issues in order\nto get the most out of\nyour fitness program.\nAnd again, by the end of today's\nprogram, I can assure you,\nyou will have a template\nprotocol that you can build\nup from, build out, change and modify,\nand that will really serve\nyour fitness goals according\nto the science and what\npeer-reviewed studies\nand the experts that\nappeared on this podcast\nand other podcasts really\ntell us is best and optimal\nfor our fitness.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nhas now launched a premium channel.\nI want to be very clear that\nthe Huberman Lab podcast\nwill continue to be released\nevery Monday at zero cost\nto consumer, and there will\nbe no change in the format\nof these podcasts.\nThe premium channel is a\nresponse to the many questions\nwe get about specific topics,\nand it will allow me to really drill deep\ninto specific answers\nrelated to those topics.\nSo once a month, I'm going\nto host and ask me anything,\nso-called AMA, where\nyou can ask me anything\nabout specific topics\ncovered on the Huberman Lab\npodcast and I will answer those questions.\nThose of course will be recorded.\nThey will also be other\npremium content available\nto premium subscribers such as transcripts\nand short videos of new\ntools and unique tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nIf you want to check\nout the premium channel,\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com/premium.\nThere is a $10 a month\ncharge or $100 per year,\nand I should mention that a large portion\nof the proceeds from the\nHuberman Lab Premium Channel\nwill go to support scientific\nresearch that develops\nthe very sorts of tools that we talk\nabout on the Huberman Lab podcast.\nThe rest of the support\nfor the Huberman Lab Podcast\npremium channel will go\nto supporting the regular\nHuberman Lab podcast.\nAgain, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.\nBefore we dive into today's\ncontent about fitness\nand fitness protocols, I want\nto tell you about a brand\nnew study that is very exciting\nand frankly very unusual.\nThis is a study that was published\nout of the University\nof Houston, examining\nwhat I would call a micro\nexercise or a micro movement.\nIt's a very small movement\nof a very small portion\nof your body, in fact, just\n1% of your musculature,\nthat when it's performed\ncontinuously while seated has,\nat least what they\nreport, are very dramatic\npositive changes in terms of blood sugar\nutilization and metabolism.\nSo the title of this study\nis \"A potent physiological\nmethod to magnify and sustain\nsoleus oxidative\nmetabolism improves glucose\nand lipid regulation.\"\nThis study was published in iScience,\nand as I mentioned earlier,\nit is getting a lot of\nattention and it's very unusual.\nWithout going into all\nthe details of this study,\nlet me just briefly give you a little bit\nof the background.\nFirst of all, you have a\nmuscle called the soleus.\nThe soleus muscle is a more\nor less wide flat muscle\nthat sits beneath what most\npeople think of as their calf,\nalthough it's part of the calf muscle.\nThe other portion of the calf\nis called the gastrocnemius.\nThe soleus sits below that.\nNow, the soleus muscle is a unique muscle\nbecause it's largely slow\ntwitch muscle fibers.\nIt's designed to be used continuously\nover and over again for\nstabilizing your body\nwhen you're standing upright, for walking.\nThis is a muscle that's\ndesigned to contract\nover and over and over again.\nIn fact, you could walk\nall day on this muscle\nand most likely it would not get sore.\nYou probably done that\nand it did not get sore.\nIn contrast, a muscle like\nyour bicep or your tricep,\nif I were to have you\nperform hundreds or thousands\nof repetitions, even\nwith a very lightweight\none pound weight or a two pound weight,\neventually it would fatigue.\nYou would feel a sort of a burn there.\nIt's a very unusual set of\nmuscles to use repeatedly.\nBut the soleus is an unusual\nmuscle in that it really\nis designed to be used continuously.\nNow, this study was focused\non how people who sit a lot\nof the day and don't have\nthe opportunity for a lot\nof physical movement or\nmaybe who don't even exercise\nat all can improve their metabolism\nand glucose utilization.\nWithout going into a deep dive\nabout glucose utilization,\nbecause we've done the\ndeep dive on this podcast,\nepisodes such as metabolism, et cetera,\nyou can look those up at hubermanlab.com.\nThey're all timestamped\nand available there.\nAnytime you eat, your blood\nsugar goes up to some extent.\nSo your blood glucose, as it's called,\ngoes up to some extent.\nAnd then insulin is a hormone that's used\nto essentially chaperone\nand sequester and use\nthat blood glucose or\nit's basically the idea\nis you don't want blood\nglucose to go too high.\nHyperinsulinemia is something associated\nwith blood glucose that's\ntoo high because insulin goes\nup to essentially match\nthe level of blood glucose.\nYou don't also don't\nwant to be hypoglycemic,\nyou don't want to have\nblood sugar that's too low,\nand insulin is involved\nin both regulating peaks\nand troughs in blood sugar, blood glucose.\nSo we can basically say,\nand this is very simple,\nbut we can basically say\nthat you don't want blood\nglucose to be elevated\ntoo much or for too long.\nThat's not good.\nIn fact, people who have\ndiabetes because they don't\nmake insulin, people who\nhave type 1 diabetes do not\nmake insulin at all, their blood glucose\nis so high that they\nactually have to take insulin\nin order to regulate otherwise\ntheir blood glucose can\ngo so high that it can damage\ncells and damage organs.\nIt can even kill people.\nPeople who have type 2 diabetes are\nso called insulin insensitive.\nThey make insulin, but the\nreceptors to insulin are\nnot sensitive to it,\nand so they make more insulin\nthan normally would be\nmade and blood glucose\nisn't regulated properly,\net cetera, et cetera.\nThe take home message about blood glucose\nis that you want your blood\nglucose levels to go up\nwhen you eat, but not too\nhigh and you don't want them\nto stay elevated for too long.\nThis study looked at how\npeople who are largely\nsedentary or at least sitting\ncan increase the utilization,\nthe clearance of glucose from\nthe bloodstream after eating,\nand they also looked\nat overall metabolism.\nFor people, get this,\nthat were using just that\n1% of muscle, the soleus,\nby doing what they call a soleus pushup.\nSo the soleus pushup can\nbe described very simply\nas if you're sitting\ndown with your knee bent\nat approximately right\nangle, like a square corner,\nand pushing up, or I should\nsay lifting your heel\nwhile pushing down on\nyour toe and contracting\nthe calf muscle as it were,\nand then lowering the\nheel and then in lifting\nthat heel again, lowering the\nheel, lifting the heel again,\neach one of those is what\nthey call a soleus pushup.\nThis study had people\ncontinuously do soleus pushups\nand they looked at things like\nblood glucose utilization,\nthey looked at metabolism and so on.\nNow, a couple of important\nthings about this study\nbefore I tell you what they discovered,\nwhich was frankly pretty miraculous,\nalmost hard to believe,\nand yet I believe the data\nlooked to be collected\nquite well, and there\nare a lot of statistics\nand the study looks to be quite thorough.\nFirst of all, they used\nan equal number of male\nand female subjects.\nThere were a wide range of\nbody mass indices, okay?\nSo this wasn't just super\nfit people or people\nthat were purely sedentary and not fit.\nThey used a wide variety\nof ages, time of day,\npeople who tended to walk\na lot or not walk a lot.\nThey measured changes\nin metabolism and blood\nglucose utilization and\npeople that had done\nthese soleus pushups while\nseated in the laboratory,\nand I must say,\nthey had them do these\nsoleus pushups for quite\na long while, continuously.\nSo they had them do it\nfor as long as 270 minutes\ntotal throughout the day.\nSo if you divide that,\nthat's four and a half hours,\nyou might say, well,\nfour and a half hours of\nlifting the heel and putting\nthe heel down, lifting the\nheel, putting the heel down,\nthat's a lot.\nBut they didn't always do it continuously.\nThey had some breaks in there.\nSo this is the sort of\nthing that you could imagine\nyou or other people could do while seated,\nwhile doing Zooms or\nwhile on calls or maybe\neven while eating, doing\nthat sort of thing.\nAlthough I'm not suggesting\nthat you constantly\nbe focusing on soleus\npushups throughout your life.\nThe point is that people\nwho did these soleus\npushups experienced dramatic\nimprovements in blood\nsugar regulation and in\nmetabolism despite the fact\nthat the soleus is just 1%\nof the total musculature.\nSo here I'm going to\nread from the abstract\nabout what they found,\npeople who did these soleus pushups,\ndespite being a tiny muscle and using very\nlittle local energy...\nIn fact, they measured muscle glycogen,\nthe burn or essentially\nthe utilization of fuel\nwithin the muscle, and\nthere was very little\nutilization of fuel\nwithin the soleus itself,\nand that's because the soleus\nhas this unique property\nof needing to basically\nkeep you going all day,\nwalking all day or moving all day.\nWhat they saw was a large\nmagnitude, for example,\n52% less postprandial,\nthat's after a meal,\nglucose excursion,\nSo 52% less increase in\nblood glucose and 60%,\nsix zero less hyper insulinemia,\nso reduced levels of insulin.\nThey also, miraculously,\nobserved that despite this being,\nagain, a small muscle, 1%\nof the total muscle mass,\nso very small oxidative use,\nthey saw big improvements in\nsystemic metabolic regulation.\nSo this is interesting\nand I think something\nthat we should at least know about.\nI'm not aware that anyone's\nreplicated this study yet.\nI know there's a ton of\nexcitement about this study\nin the popular press, and if\nthe data turn out to hold up,\nwhich I like to imagine they will,\nI can understand why\nthere's so much excitement.\nWhat this means is that if\nyou're somebody who cares\nabout blood glucose regulation,\nyou want to keep your metabolism running,\nplease don't stop exercising,\nthe other ways that you exercise.\nBut if you're somebody who\nwants to maximize your health,\ndoing these soleus pushups\nfairly continuously\nwhile seated is going to be beneficial.\nAnd in addition to that,\nI know that there are going\nto be people out there who,\nfor instance, might be\ninjured or you're traveling\nand you're stuck on a plane\nor you're in the classroom\nand you're forced to study\nall day or take notes all day.\nYou're just not getting\nenough opportunity to get\nthose steps that you want to take,\nwhether or that's 10,000 or fewer or more,\ngetting enough steps or movement.\nMaybe you don't have time\nto get out and do your run,\nor maybe you're also running,\nweightlifting and doing\nyoga classes and things\nof that sort, but you want to\nfurther improve your fitness,\nat least in terms of\nyour metabolic health.\nThis seems like a terrific,\nvery low investment way to do it.\nCertainly zero cost.\nIt does take a little bit of attention,\nso you have to divert\nyour attention from other\nthings you're doing to\nmake sure that you're still\ndoing these soleus pushups.\nI'm sure that many of you\nare going to have a lot\nof detailed questions such\nas how high did they lift\nthe heel and did they contract\nthe muscle very hard or not?\nCouple of things about that,\nthey did not have subjects\nreally contract the muscle hard.\nThey did measure the angle of heel raise\nand it was anywhere from 10 to 15 degrees\nso they didn't have to go way,\nway up on their tippy toes\nor things of that sort.\nIn any event, 270 minutes,\nfour and a half hours of\ndoing these soleus pushups\nis a lot, but by my read of the data\nand the rather significant,\nor I should say very significant effects\nthat they observed on\nblood glucose regulation\nand metabolism, et cetera,\nseems to me that doing less\nwould still be beneficial\nand that you don't necessarily\nhave to do the full\n270 minutes in order to get the benefits\nthat they observed.\nMore about the study includes the fact\nthat the benefits they observed\nwere very long lasting,\nas long as two hours after a meal,\nthey could still see this improved\nblood glucose utilization.\nI don't know because I wasn't able to find\nit in the methods whether\nor not they were doing\nthe soleus pushups while\nthey were consuming blood\nsugar in this study.\nThe point being that if\nyou're somebody who cares\nabout their fitness, this\nstudy is interesting,\nbecause what it means is that, again,\nif you are forced to be\nimmobile or sitting longer\nthan you would like,\nif you're stuck in a meeting or Zooms\nor class or on a plane, et cetera,\nor if you're simply trying to add a bit\nmore fitness and metabolic\nhealth to your overall regimen,\nsoleus pushups, at least to me,\nseem like a very low investment, simple,\nzero cost tool to improve\nyour metabolic health.\nFor those of you that\nwant to peruse the study\nin more detail, we will provide a link\nto this paper published in iScience\nin the show note caption.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of my\ndesire and effort to bring\nzero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from\nyour blood and DNA to help\nyou better understand your\nbody and help you meet\nyour health goals.\nNow, I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular\nblood work done for the\nsimple reason that many\nof the factors that impact your immediate\nand long-term health can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nOne issue with a lot of\nblood tests and DNA tests\nout there, however, is that\nyou get information back\nabout hormones, blood lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes\nunderstanding all of that very\neasy and even better points\nto specific directives,\nthat is things you can do\nin terms of your lifestyle,\nyour nutrition,\nsupplementation, et cetera,\nin order to bring those numbers related\nto metabolic factors,\nlipids, hormones, et cetera,\ninto the ranges that are optimal for you,\nyour immediate and long-term health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of InsideTracker plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20%

Stanford and everything\nabout ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that\nyour visual system has\nto contend with an enormous\nnumber of challenges\nin order for you to be\nable to see clearly.\nROKA understands this and has designed\ntheir sunglasses and\neyeglasses to be worn in any\nnumber of different conditions\nand for you to still\nbe able to see with crystal clarity.\nNow, I wear eyeglasses at night,\nwhen I work or when I drive,\nand I wear sunglasses during the day.\nI don't wear sunglasses\nwhen I get my morning\nsunlight viewing, a\npractice that I'm absolutely\nreligious about every single morning,\nbut throughout the day,\nI'll wear sunglasses when\nI drive or if I'm heading\ninto bright sunlight to protect my eyes.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are terrific\nbecause they were\ndesigned for performance,\nso they were designed for\nthings like cycling and running,\nso they won't slip off your\nface if they get sweaty.\nThey're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the time\nI can't even remember\nthat they're on my face,\nthey're so lightweight.\nHowever, they also can be\nworn anywhere, to work,\nto dinner, et cetera.\nThey have a terrific aesthetics.\nUnlike a lot of other\nperformance eyeglasses\nout there that you can\nonly find in designs\nthat really make people\nlook like a cyborg.\nROKA makes the cyborg versions,\nsome people like those,\nbut they also make versions\nof their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses with frames that\nyou can wear out to dinner,\nto work, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\ngo to roka.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A .com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your

to\nyour unique sleep needs.\nNow, sleep is the fundamental layer\nthat is the most important\naspect of mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nI've said that before on this podcast,\nand I'm going to be saying\nit over and over again.\nIf you're sleeping well,\neverything else is better,\nand if you're not sleeping well,\neverything else gets far worse.\nSo sleep is vital,\nand sleeping on the correct\nmattress is absolutely vital.\nHelix understands this,\nand they have a brief quiz\nthat you can take.\nSo you simply go to their\nwebsite, you take this quiz,\nask you questions such\nas you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night, you\ntend to sleep on your back,\nyour side or your stomach,\nor maybe you don't know,\nand they match you to\na mattress that's ideal\nfor your particular sleep needs.\nFor me, that was the\nDusk mattress, D-U-S-K.\nI've been sleeping on a\nDusk mattress for well\nover a year now, and it's\nthe best sleep I've ever had.\nIf you like to try Helix Mattress,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.\nTake that brief two minute\nsleep quiz and they'll\nmatch you to a customized\nmattress for your sleep needs.\nYou'll get up to $200\noff all mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off and two free pillows.\nThe Huberman Lab podcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous Supplements.\nTo find the supplements we discuss\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nyou can go to live\nMomentous spelled O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman,\nand I should just mention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about fitness and let's talk\nabout how you can develop\nthe optimal fitness\nprotocols for you.\nSo that includes what to\ndo each day of the week\nand your fitness protocol across the week,\nand indeed across the month and the year\nand even year to year.\nWhen we had Dr. Andy\nGalpin on the podcast,\nhe said something very\nimportant that we want to keep\nin mind today, which is concepts\nare few, methods are many,\nthat is there are an\ninfinite number of different\nprograms and exercises\nand set and rep schemes\nand different runs and burpees\nand pushups, et cetera,\net cetera that one can follow.\nHowever, there are really\njust a few basic concepts\nor principles of muscle physiology,\nof cardiovascular function,\nof connective tissue\nfunction that provide or set the basis\nfor the adaptations that we call fitness\nor that lead to fitness.\nSo I'm going to list those off now.\nWe can talk about a fitness\nprotocol that's really\naimed mainly toward developing skill.\nThat's one. Or speed.\nThat's another.\nOr power, which is speed times strength,\nor specifically strength, or hypertrophy,\ngrowth of muscles, or endurance\nsuch as muscular endurance.\nMuscular endurance is, for instance,\nyour ability to stay in\na plank position or to do\na wall sit, to sit on an\ninvisible chair against a wall,\nor other forms of endurance like near\npure anaerobic endurance.\nSo a one minute sprint or\nless or a one minute all\nout cycling on stationary\nbike, this sort of thing,\nor endurance that occurs\nin the kind of 3 to 12\nminute total duration range.\nSo that might be sprints or high intensity\ninterval type training.\nIt could be an all out swim,\nit could be all out row.\nThat's another form of endurance,\ntaps into different fuel systems,\ndifferent aspects of muscle\nphysiology, et cetera.\nAnd then endurance that\nlasts 30 minutes or more,\nwhich is typically what people think\nabout when they think about endurance.\nBut of course, the other\nforms of endurance matter.\nSo we've got skill, speed,\npower, strength, hypertrophy,\nmuscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,\nwhat I would call 3 to\n12 minute endurance,\nalthough it goes by other names as well,\nand 30 minutes or more endurance type\nexercise and adaptations.\nEach and every one of these\nrequires different principles,\ndifferent concepts in order to improve,\nsay your muscular strength\nor your hypertrophy or both.\nHowever, there's a general\ntheme that sits beneath\nall adaptations leading to fitness,\nand that's what we're\nreally going to set down\nas the base layer,\nthe foundation of everything\nwe talk about today.\nAnd that's that we need\nto think about what are\nthe modifiable variables?\nAgain, I'm borrowing\ndirectly from the episode\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nHe was the one that said,\nmodifiable variables are the\nkey thing to think about.\nWhat are you going to modify?\nWhat are you going to change\nin order to increase one\nor some of the various things\nI listed off before, skill,\nspeed, power, strength,\nhypertrophy, endurance,\net cetera, et cetera.\nAnd some of the key concepts that emerge\nfrom that discussion are\nthat we need to think\nabout progressive overload.\nNormally when people hear\nabout progressive overload,\nthey think about adding more\nweight to a bar or picking\nup heavier dumbbells,\nbut that could also be\nprogressive overload in\nthe context of running up\na hill of steeper incline\nor running a little bit\nfaster or a little bit further\nand so on and so forth.\nNow, as I promised earlier,\ntoday we are not going to\ndrill into each and every one\nof the mechanisms that\nunderlie the different\nadaptations that are\ngoing to develop speed\nand strength and endurance, et cetera,\nbecause that was covered in the podcast\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin and the other podcast\nwith experts that I mentioned earlier.\nAnd we again, will provide\nlinks to those podcasts\nif you want to drill\ninto those mechanisms.\nInstead, what we are going\nto do is we're going to start\nwith a program that\nessentially is designed\nfor you to maximize all aspects of fitness\nto the extent that you can\nsimultaneously maximize\nall aspects of fitness,\nbut then to change or modify that protocol\nso that if you want to\nbuild up more, for instance,\nstrength and you want to\njust hold onto the endurance\nyou have, you don't\nwant to build endurance,\nat least not in that week or\nthat month, you can do that.\nOr if you want to improve your endurance\nwhile maintaining your\nstrength, you can do that.\nAnd so on and so forth.\nMost people, I do believe,\nwould like a combination\nof strength and endurance\nand flexibility and\nmaybe even hypertrophy,\nparticularly for certain\nmuscle groups that maybe are\nnot as well developed\nas other muscle groups.\nThey want to bring\nbalance to their physique,\nboth for sake of aesthetics\nand for sake of health\nand for sake of general functioning,\nto maybe even to eliminate pain,\nthe protocol that I'm going\nto describe really works\nas a foundational\ntemplate for that as well.\nSo let's drill into that\nfoundational protocol\nand I'll keep referring to it\nas the foundational protocol,\nnot because it's the one that I use,\nalthough it is the one that I use,\nand not because it's the\none that we're talking\nabout today, although\nit's the one we're talking\nabout today, but because\nwe need some general\nframework from which to build out the more\nspecific protocols that\nwe'll get into in a bit\nmore detail later.\nSo in this foundational\nprotocol for fitness,\nwhat you'll notice is\nthat on any one given day,\nyou're going to focus on one\nparticular aspect of fitness.\nMaybe it's endurance, maybe it's strength,\nmaybe it's hypertrophy, in particular,\nit might be hypertrophy for\na particular muscle group\nor muscle groups.\nThat said, across the entire week,\nit's designed to bring\nfitness and different forms\nof fitness to all aspects of your body.\nSo this particular protocol begins\non Sunday, although that's\nsimply the day that I happen\nto begin the protocol.\nAnd again, this protocol is not important\nbecause it's the one that I follow.\nI follow it because it is important.\nIn other words, it's a\nprotocol that's really gleaned\nfrom the scientific\nliterature and the experts,\nthat is for you.\nSo this fitness protocol\nis really about you.\nI just may refer to it as\nthe one that I follow simply\nfor ease of communication.\nAnd for me, my week begins on Sunday.\nSo I do my very best to\nget a workout in on Sunday.\nAnd for me, that workout is\nthat of a endurance workout.\nIt's designed to either maintain\nor increase my endurance,\nand the endurance type that I'm referring\nto is endurance of 30 minutes or more.\nIn fact, for me, the goal\nis always to get either 60\nto 75 minutes of jogging.\nSo this would be\nso-called zone two cardio,\npeople probably have\nheard of zone two cardio,\nbut if you haven't, that's okay.\nZone two cardio is something\nthat you could measure\nwith a heart rate monitor or other device,\nbut you don't need to.\nZone two cardio is the kind\nof cardiovascular exercise\nin which you're pushing yourself to move\nsuch that you're breathing\nfaster than normal,\nyour heart is beating\nfaster than normal, however,\nyou are still able to\nsustain a conversation.\nBut if you were to push\nyourself any harder,\nthat is move faster or\ngo up a steeper incline\nat the same rate you happen\nto be at any one moment,\nyou would lose that ability to speak,\nyou wouldn't be able\nto complete sentences,\nyou would be out of breath or you'd have\nto pause mid-sentence.\nNow, it's near impossible,\neven with a heart rate monitor,\nto stay exactly in zone\ntwo unless you're very,\nvery skilled at that.\nSo I don't obsess over that,\nand in fact I don't wear\na heart rate monitor\nwhen I do this exercise, but for me,\nthe goal is to head out\non Sunday and get 60 to 75\nminutes of jogging in zone two.\nNow of course I like to jog,\nbut that doesn't mean\nthat you have to jog.\nYou could replace jogging with\nrowing on a rowing machine\nor maybe even rowing an actual boat\nif you have access to that\nor cycling or swimming,\nsomething that allows you\ncontinuous movement for 60\nto 75 minutes at that zone two threshold\nwe talked about earlier.\nFor me, that can include some\nhills, and when I say hills,\nthey could be very steep hills,\nbut I simply slow my pace\ndown in order to stay\nin that roughly zone two range.\nOr it could be that they\nare more low grade hills\nand I might just slow down\na little bit or I might\neven push myself a tiny bit that day.\nBut really I'm just trying\nto build that long endurance.\nI'm trying to build up\nmy capacity or maintain\nmy capacity to go a long\ndistance without fatiguing.\nNow some days, meaning\nsome Sundays, since I tend\nto do this almost always\non Sunday, although there are exceptions,\ninstead of doing the 60 to 75 minute jog,\nwhat I'll do is I will\nhead out for a long hike\nthat could be two and a\nhalf hours or three hours\nor maybe even a four or five hour hike.\nSometimes it's very long.\nAnd I'll do that sometimes\nsimply to mix up the routine,\nbecause sometimes jogging\nand jogging the same routes\ngets boring to me.\nI do enjoy running,\nthat's something I've been\ndoing for a very long time,\nbut sometimes it just\ngets a little bit tedious\nand I want to do something different.\nAlso, sometimes I want\nto be social on Sundays.\nI want to head out on a hike\nwith my partner or I want\nto meet up with friends\nand hike with them.\nAnd so taking a long hike\non Sunday is something\nthat also could be quite social.\nAnd then I don't have to\nworry about also getting\nin my workout when I'm\nheading out on a hike\nwith my partner or going\nout to meet with friends\nor things of that sort.\nI will say that there's a specific tool\nor a specific change that\nyou can make to this Sunday\nlong endurance, or at least\nwhat I consider long for me,\nI mean it's by no means a marathon\nor an Ironman, but this\nlong endurance training,\nand that's the use of a weight vest.\nSo something that I've\nreally started utilizing\nmore recently, and by more recently,\nI really mean within the last year or so,\nis I purchased one of\nthese weight vests that can\nbe anywhere from 10 to 50 pounds.\nWhat I use in the weight\nvest is irrelevant.\nBut it certainly changes\nthe level of effort required\nwhen taking a hike or even a walk.\nNow there's an additional\nbenefit of the weight vest,\nwhich is that if you\nare going out for a hike\nor even for a walk for social reasons\nand you're with somebody that's not quite\nat the same fitness level that you are,\nfrankly it's a little bit\nrude to just keep walking\nahead of them and running\nback or running ahead\nand running back.\nOftentimes you really want\nto spend time with the person\nand you don't want them to feel\nas if they're holding you up.\nAnd so the weight vest\nis a terrific way to get\nsome additional work, then,\nas you'll find if you wear a weight vest,\nit is additional work\non, say, a shorter hike.\nSo maybe the person\nyou're with only has time\nfor an hour long hike,\nor maybe they just don't have\nthe fitness to do a two hour,\nthree hour hike.\nSo I'll throw on the\nweight vest and I'll head\nout for a walk with them\nor a hike with them,\nor sometimes I'll go out on a long hike\nwith a weight vest myself.\nSo again, the point of this, for me,\nSunday, although it could fall\non any day for you, workout,\nis really to build up\nthat long form endurance.\nAnd this fits well\nwith what Dr. Andy Galpin\nand Dr. Peter Attia referred\nto as the real need to\nget in some long endurance\ntype work at some point\nor even multiple points\nthroughout the week.\nFor me, this long Sunday\njog of 60 to 75 minutes\nor long Sunday hike or\nweighted walk or weighted hike\nreally accomplishes that goal.\nSometimes leads to a\nlittle bit of soreness,\nparticularly in my\ncalves or if I'm wearing\nthe weight vest, sometimes\nmy midsection will get\nsore because I'm trying to remain upright.\nSo I think it also builds\nup some muscular endurance,\nnot just cardiovascular\nendurance, but again,\nthroughout the entire time\nthat I'm jogging or hiking,\nwhat I'm trying to get to\nis a place where I can feel\nthat my pulse rate is definitely elevated,\nbut it's not so elevated\nthat I have to stop\nbecause I'm out of breath.\nAnd because I know some\npeople out there might be\nreally neurotic about this sort of thing,\nif you have to stop because\nyou're out of breath,\nthat doesn't mean that\nyou blew the workout,\nthat you now aren't getting endurance.\nOf course, you're\ngetting benefits from it.\nSo I'm not absolutely\nneurotic about always\nstaying exactly in that heart rate zone.\nI might stop and have a\nconversation for a moment\nif it's a longer hike,\nalthough I really try\nand keep moving and I try\nand push myself just a little bit further\nthan where I'm exceedingly comfortable.\nAnd so for me,\ndoing this long Sunday\nhike or jog really provides\na foundation, a base\nfor endurance that then\nthe other endurance workouts\nthat I'll describe later,\nthat take place later in\nthe week, can build on.\nNow, as I mentioned earlier,\nwe will get back to the\nmechanisms that this taps\ninto and why this is so useful.\nThere are multiple benefits\nto doing these kinds\nof endurance type workouts\nin zone two cardio.\nBut by putting it at the\nstart of my week, again,\nmy week starts on Sunday,\nI'm sure that regardless\nof how the rest of the week goes,\nthat I got my endurance training in,\nand of course I'm going to want to,\nand I will do endurance\ntraining other days\nduring the week, but if\nsomething comes up or I happen\nto get sick or I'm really\nbehind in terms of work\nand I can't get other workouts\nin, this Sunday long jog\nor hike really provides that fundamental,\nI can honestly say foundation,\nfor cardiovascular fitness\nand endurance that I can\nhang my hat on and say, okay,\nI've got that one in the bag,\nand I can then look to other\ndays of the week to focus\non other aspects of fitness.\nNow, a really important point to make\nabout this Sunday endurance\nworkout is that allows\nyou to check off a box and\nthat box is 75 or so minutes\nof zone two cardio, because\nas you may have heard,\neither in this podcast or\nfrom others out there like\nDr. Peter Attia, getting\n180 to 200 minutes\nof zone two cardio per week\nhas enormous positive effects\non longevity and enormous positive effects\non general health, again,\nin terms of cardiovascular function,\nbut also metabolic fuel utilization,\nalso in terms of your\nmusculature and your ability\nto use your body over\nlong distances for long\nperiods of time.\nSo while it doesn't complete\nall 180 to 200 minutes\nper week, it certainly\ngets you a good distance,\npun intended, toward that goal.\nNow, I want to acknowledge\nthat some people might\nbe starting a fitness program,\nand so 60 to 75 minutes of\njogging might be too long\nor a three hour weight vested hike,\nor some people might even\ndo what's called a ruck,\nlike you wear a rucksack,\nthat might be too much,\nin which case certainly\nstart with less and go\non flat ground and go\nat the rate that allows\nyou to get into zone two,\nbut that is not excessively\ndifficult for you.\nAnd then as you build up fitness,\nyou can add time or you can add weight\nthrough a weight vest,\nor if you don't want to\nbuy a weight vest or can't\nafford one, there's a\nsimple solution to that,\nI actually have a good\nanecdote about that.\nOne time I was heading out\nfor a hike with a friend\nof mine, he was a former\nSEAL team operator,\nI'll never forget this,\nand he said, oh yeah,\n\"I'll bring you a sack.\"\nAnd I thought he meant like a sack lunch,\nlike he was going to bring lunch.\nAnd I showed up and he\nbasically gave me a backpack\nthat was loaded with a bunch of stuff\nand the backpack weighed about 40 pounds.\nAnd then we took a hike.\nSo I was thinking lunch, he\nwas thinking weighted backpack,\nand weighted backpack or\neven just any kind of strong\nsack that you can put over\nyour shoulders or even carry\nin your arms, it's going to\nwork exceedingly well to build\nin some extra requirement for effort.\nSo you certainly don't have\nto purchase a weight vest\nin order to get the benefits\nof bringing additional\nweight along with you on these\nlong cardiovascular events.\nBut again, build up over\ntime, you can add time,\nyou can add weight,\nand that's also a really nice\nfeature of adding weight,\nwhich is at some point your\nschedule might be such,\nor you just don't really\nwant to keep adding more\nand more and more time on\nthis long endurance Sunday,\nin this case, workout,\nin that case add weight.\nYou can also, as you build up fitness,\nyou can add speed to it,\nyour zone two and what\nzone two is won't shift,\nbut what work is required\nfrom you in order to get\ninto zone two will shift.\nThat is as you get more and more fit,\nyou'll have to move faster\nand or bring more weight\nin order to stay in zone two\nand that will simply tell\nyou that you are indeed\nimproving your endurance.\nOkay, so then Monday\nrolls around and I, like\nmost everyone else out there,\nI work on Monday, I get\nright into my emails\nand preparation for podcasts and running\nmy laboratory, et cetera.\nHowever, I make sure that at some point\non Monday, and for me that\nsome point is typically\nand ideally early in the\nmorning, so 7:00 AM or so,\nI train my legs on Monday,\nso that includes quadriceps,\nhamstrings, and calves.\nWhy do I do that workout on Monday?\nAnd what is that workout designed to do?\nWell, that workout is\nreally designed to make sure\nthat I'm either maintaining\nor building strength\nin my legs.\nAnd this is not simply\nfor aesthetic reasons.\nThis is not simply to\ngrow bigger calves or grow\nbigger quadriceps and hamstrings,\nalthough it can accomplish\nthat as well depending\non how you train.\nWe'll talk about details of training.\nThe reason for training legs\non Monday is several fold.\nFirst of all, they are\nthe largest muscle groups\nof the body, and by training your legs\non Monday, it sets in\nmotion a large number\nof metabolic processes that\ncarry you some distance\neven through the whole week in terms\nof elevating metabolism,\nin terms of amplifying\ncertain hormonal events\nin your body, et cetera,\nthat are really beneficial.\nIn addition to that,\nI'm of the belief that the\nlegs are the foundation\nof the body, and provided\nyou can train legs safely,\nthat training legs is vitally important,\nnot just for strength of the legs,\nbut also for strength of your entire body.\nAgain, some of that is\nthrough systemic hormonal\neffects because if you're\ngoing to train the large\nmuscle groups of your body\nunder substantial loads,\nyou will get systemic release of hormones,\nnot just testosterone, although\ncertainly testosterone,\nbut also things like growth hormone...\nYou get increases in\nall sorts of so-called\nanabolic hormones that\neven if you're somebody\nwho's not trying to increase muscle size,\nbecause I realize a lot\nof people are not trying\nto do that, these are hormones that shift\nyour metabolism and your\noverall tendon strength\nand ligament strength\nand overall musculature\ninto what I would call\na strong foundation.\nSo for me, Monday is leg workout.\nIt also just feels good\nto get the leg workout\nout of the way earlier in the week,\nand it accomplishes another goal,\nwhich is that I sometimes\nwill take one or two days off\nof a leg workout because\nthey can be very intense\nand they are large muscle groups,\nand I'll explain what\nI do on the off days,\nthey're not pure off days,\nthey actually include some\nrecovery type training\nor even some all out training.\nBut by training legs on\nMonday, I'm able to get\nwhat I consider the hardest strength\nand hypertrophy workout\nout of the way, and, again,\nset all those positive\nphysiological effects in motion\nfor the entire week.\nThe other thing is that no\nworkout exists in isolation.\nWhat you do one day is\ngoing to be determined\nby what you did the previous day.\nAnd even though the previous\nday I may have taken\na three hour weight vested hike,\nnever are my legs so\nsore from that long slow\nendurance work, because\nit is long and slow,\nthat I'm unable to train legs.\nContrast that with a, say,\nhigh intensity interval training workout,\nwhich comes later in the week,\nand my legs might be sore.\nIn fact, they might not\neven be recovered such\nthat I'm able to do a real legwork,\nI want to say a real workout.\nI'll describe what that means in a moment.\nSo legs come on Monday, and I think\nthat for those of you that\nare using or interested\nin using resistance training,\nI suggest getting your leg\nworkout done early in the week.\nAnd for those of you that\nhave heard the phrase,\ndon't skip leg day, I will\ngo a step further and say,\ndon't skip leg day, in fact,\nmake leg day your first day of strength\nand hypertrophy training.\nPut it on Monday.\nOkay, so now that we're talking\nabout resistance training,\nthe question is going to\ncome up about sets and reps\nand all of that business.\nThat was covered in a lot\nof detail on the podcast\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin, and\nI'm going to get into some\nof that detail now,\nbut I'm going to wait until\nI describe the entire set\nof workouts for the week before\nI go into even more detail,\nbecause there's a way of\nwhat's called periodizing\nthat is changing the\nsets and reps, et cetera,\nacross the week, and\nindeed from month to month,\nthat's really optimal.\nBut I don't want to make it seem as if all\nof that just pertains to the leg workout.\nIt actually pertains to all\nof the resistance training.\nSo I'll just give you a couple of teasers\nabout the key principles\nof resistance training\nthat I think are almost\nuniversally, if not universally,\nthen generally accepted\nin the strength training\nand physiology community.\nAnd then later I'll get back to some\nof the overarching\nprinciples that apply to all\nstrength and hypertrophy\nworkouts across the week,\nincluding the ones for the\ntorso, the arms, et cetera.\nOkay, so legs fall on Monday, I should say\nthat leg workouts, like all\nresistance training workouts,\nfor me, consist of about, again,\nI'm not neurotically attached to this,\nbut about 10 minutes of\nwarming up and then about 50,\nfive zero, to 60 minutes of real work.\nNow, of course, some of that is\ngoing to be rest between sets,\nbut by real work, I mean really hard work,\nnot necessarily to failure,\nwe'll talk about failure in a little bit,\nbut hard work where I'm\nstruggling to complete\nthe final repetitions,\nif not going to failure\nto continue to move\nthe weight repetitions.\nAnd again, the entire work\nportion of that workout\nis about 50 to 60 minutes.\nWhy?\nWell, past 60 minutes,\nyou start getting increases in cortisol\nthat really impede recovery.\nAnd I personally am somebody\nthat does not recover\nvery well from high intensity exercise.\nI realize that within the\nliterature, it is believed,\nand I think generally accepted,\nthat when you stimulate muscle hypertrophy\nor strength increases, it\nimpacts the nervous system,\nit also causes things like\nprotein synthesis, et cetera.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent forms of adaptation\nthat occur to give you muscle\nstrength and size changes.\nAnd these days people\ntalk a lot about needing\nto stimulate muscle\ngrowth or muscle strength\nat least every 48 hours.\nBut I can tell you that I\nrecover route there slowly,\nand I benefit from working\nthe same muscle group\nabout twice per week, with longer,\nor I should say more days of rest\nin between those workouts.\nSo if I train legs on\nMonday, believe it or not,\nI'm only training legs on Monday.\nI do not have a second leg\nworkout during the week.\nHowever, on Friday, I do a high intensity\ninterval training session\nthat serves two purposes.\nOne is it serves the purpose\nof triggering a certain\ntype of endurance and\ngetting my heart rate\nvery, very high.\nAnd in addition to that,\nbecause of the way I do that workout,\nit acts as a sort of supplement or a more\nmoderate intensity workout\nfor quadriceps, hamstrings,\nand calves, such that I at\nleast never lose strength,\nand in fact, generally\nbuild strength from one leg\nworkout to the next, provided\nI'm doing things correctly.\nSo what I'm not referring\nto is the kind of classic\nsuper high intensity training\nonce per week and then\nnot actually training\nthat muscle group again.\nFor me, it's really training\neach muscle group twice\nper week, once directly\nand then once indirectly,\neither during another\nweight training workout\nor during a cardiovascular,\nI should say endurance training workout.\nSo again, legs on Monday, the\nworkout is 50 to 60 minutes,\nafter a brief warmup.\nI generally pick two\nexercises per muscle group.\nSo again, I'm doing calves,\nI'm doing quadriceps,\nand I'm doing hamstrings.\nYou should pick the\nexercises that work for you.\nSo that's why I'm actually\nnot going to share\nwhich exercises I use.\nI'll give you a couple suggestions\nabout the ones I do use,\nbut really, exercise selection,\nas Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,\nis a very important variable.\nAnd the key thing to\nemphasize for that variable\nis that you need to be able to\nperform the movement safely.\nSo I know there's a huge debate out there,\nand people love to argue\nabout whether or not one\ncan squat or deadlift\nfor long periods of time,\nor should or should not.\nSome people say you absolutely should.\nI personally do not squat\nand do not deadlift.\nI've actually never done much\nsquatting or deadlifting,\nand I know some people\nout there are probably\nrolling their eyes or switching\nthe channel at this point.\nBut I can say that for me,\nI've been able to achieve the strength\nand hypertrophy goals\nthat I've been seeking,\ndoing things like leg\nextensions and hack squats\nor for hamstrings, doing\nthings like leg curls\nand glute-ham raises or\nfor calves doing standing\nand seated calf raises and so on.\nI think a key principle\nthat everyone should pay\nattention to is one that was taught to me\nby an excellent strength coach years ago,\nand I still use this and\nat least it works for me.\nFor each muscle group,\ntry and find an exercise in\nwhich you get that muscle\ninto a weighted stretch position.\nSo this would be, for instance,\nthe standing calf raise,\ndown at the bottom,\nit's weighted and you're\nin a deep stretch provided\nyou're doing the movement correctly.\nAs well as another exercise\nwhere you're getting\ncontraction in the shortened\nposition of the muscle.\nSo for the hamstrings,\nthat would be the leg curl,\nfor the calves, it would\nbe a seated calf raise,\nfor the quadriceps, the leg extension is,\nif the machine is designed\nright and you're doing\nit correctly, the peak\ncontraction is largely going\nto occur at the legs extended position,\nbut then another exercise\nfor each muscle group\nthat puts the muscle\ninto more of a stretched\nor at least a larger range\nof motion or compound\ntype movement,\nbut ideally where there's\nsome stretch there.\nSo I guess I will tell\nyou what exercise I do,\nfor the quadriceps is\ngoing to be leg extensions\nand hack squats.\nI use hack squats because\nI don't do free bar squats\nfor safety reasons, and I\nlike the hack squat machine.\nI'll do leg curls and glute-ham\nraises for hamstrings,\nand I'll do standing calf\nraises and seated calf\nraises for the calves.\nAgain, those are the movements that I use\nbecause I can perform them\nsafely in the repetition\nranges and with the weights\nthat are required for me\nto either maintain or build\nleg strength and calf strength.\nBut you might decide that\nfor you, dead lifts are\nabsolutely essential and terrific,\nor squats free bar squats\nare absolutely terrific\nor front squats.\nI'm not here to tell you which\nexercises to do or not do.\nI am telling you that it's probably wise\nto at least consider doing\nat least two exercises\nper muscle group, probably three maximum,\nif you ask me if you're\ndoing your entire legs\nand calves in one day.\nBut to think about doing one exercise\nwhere the muscle's brought\ninto that shortened\npeak contraction position,\nlike leg curls or leg\nextensions or seated calf raise,\nand then another exercise\nfor each muscle group\nwhere there's more of\na elongation and maybe\neven a stretch on the muscle group.\nIn fact, that's a principle\nthat you'll hear me talk\nabout later when I talk\nabout training other muscle\ngroups for strength and hypertrophy.\nSo now you know approximately\nhow long to train,\nyou might be somebody who\ncan get away with training\nfor an hour and a half,\nand that won't impede your recovery.\nFor me, that really starts\nto impede my recovery.\nAlso, if I'm staying on task,\nthat 60 minute limit\nreally works well for me.\nDo I occasionally train for 75 minutes?\nYes, because if I'm waiting\nfor a piece of equipment,\nsometimes I have to just wait longer.\nSo that happens.\nBut I really try and\nkeep the total duration\nof the workout shorter.\nHow many sets and reps and rest intervals?\nWell, that was covered by\nDr. Andy Galpin as well.\nWithout getting into the total science,\nhere's a brief summary\nof how to structure that.\nIt's pretty clear that\nif you're going to do\nlower repetitions and heavier weight,\nthat you're going to want\nto do a bit more volume.\nI know that this spits\nin the face of what a lot\nof people think, but so if\nyou're going to do five sets\nof five, and I would\nconsider five repetitions\nlow repetition range, heavier weight,\nand if you're going to train\nwith higher repetitions,\nyou can do fewer sets.\nThat certainly works for me.\nI generally follow a program\nwhere for about a month,\nso three to four weeks,\nI will do all my resistance training\nin the repetition range of\nabout four to eight repetitions.\nSo that's rather heavy. A few more sets.\nSo it might be anywhere from three to four\nsets per exercise.\nAgain, still just two exercises.\nAnd longer rest between sets,\nanywhere from two minutes\nto maybe even four minutes\nif it's really heavy leg work.\nAnd then for the next month,\nswitch to repetition range\nthat's closer to 8 to 12,\nmaybe even 15 repetitions per set,\nbut do fewer sets overall,\nso maybe just two to\nthree sets per exercise.\nAgain, just two exercises\nper muscle group typically.\nAnd shorten the rest between\nsets so that it's more\nin the 90 second,\nmaybe even as short as 60\nsecond rest between sets,\nbut typically 90 seconds\nto about two minutes or two\nand a half minutes.\nSo basically it's one month heavier,\nthe next month, slightly lighter,\nalthough I wouldn't say lighter,\nI would say moderate weight\nand moderate rep range.\nThat tends to work well for me.\nIt also adheres to a\nprincipal that came up\nduring the discussion, again,\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin,\nthat for hypertrophy,\nyou really can use\nrepetition ranges anywhere\nfrom 5 to 30, three zero, reps.\nBut he emphasized changing\nthe repetition ranges\nin order to offset boredom.\nFrankly, I like to train heavier.\nI enjoy training in the\nfour to eight rep range.\nHowever, I notice that\nif I do that for more\nthan four weeks in a\nrow and I don't switch\nover to training in the\n8 to 12, maybe in 15\nrepetition range for about a month,\nwell then I can't make\ncontinuous progress.\nI start to actually lose ground.\nBut by switching back and forth,\nI actually can make\ncontinuous progress at least\nacross the year.\nSo I hope that that principle,\nor I should say that protocol\nwas communicated clearly.\nIt works very well, I assure you.\nDoes that mean that I\nnever get 10 repetitions\non a week when I'm supposed\nto train in the four\nto eight repetition range?\nNo.\nOccasionally I'll venture up\ninto the 10 repetition range,\nbut I really try and cluster\nthe low repetition work\nfor about a month, again,\nacross all workouts and all exercises\nand the slightly higher,\nI would even say moderate\nrepetition work across\nto the next month.\nOne thing that you'll\nnotice since we are talking\nabout total fitness programming\nis that during the months\nwhere you are doing\nmoderate repetitions, you'll notice\nthat your endurance work\nwill actually be facilitated.\nAnd I do not think that's a coincidence.\nIn fact, it's not a coincidence.\nIt's because when you\nare training very heavy\nor in the heavier range,\nlower repetitions, et cetera,\nyou're tapping into different\nprocesses in those muscles.\nSo when you head out for\nthat long Sunday hike,\nor as you'll soon hear,\nwhereas on Friday you're\ngoing to do high intensity\ninterval training, what you'll notice\nis during certain months\nof weight training,\nwhen you're training more\nheavy, those workouts will feel,\nliterally will feel\ndifferent than they will\nduring the months when you're doing\nmoderate repetition work.\nI am not a competitive athlete.\nI'm not running races\nor triathlons like some\nof my friends.\nI'm very impressed by them.\nI'm really just trying to get overall\ncardiovascular fitness, overall strength,\noverall hypertrophy where I\nneed it, maintain muscle size,\net cetera,\nin muscle groups where I'm\njust trying to maintain.\nThat's really my goal.\nSo I'm not trying to optimize\nany of these workouts\nfor any one performance\nfeature, but in a little bit,\nwe'll talk about how you\ncan change various aspects,\nthat is, variables of these\nprotocols, in order to say,\nfor instance, really emphasize hypertrophy\nor really emphasize endurance.\nOkay, so with what I would call a standard\nendurance workout done\non Sunday, and I say\nstandard because most people,\nwhen they hear endurance,\nthey think of the ability to endure,\nto continue in a repeated\nmovement or exercise\nover some period of time,\nwith that workout done on Sunday, and then\nwith the leg workout done\non Monday, you can feel\nreally good about how you're\nheading into the week.\nHowever, after training\nlegs on Monday, I experience\nthat doing cardiovascular\nworkouts the next day\nis either inefficient or at\nleast doesn't really allow\nme to completely recover\nfrom my leg workout.\nNow, I realize that\nsome people are going to\nimmediately scoff at that, and in fact,\nthere are really beautiful\npapers out there talking\nabout how one can\nactually do a fair amount\nof cardiovascular exercise\nwithout interfering\nwith their strength and\nspeed and hypertrophy\nimprovements and vice versa.\nIn fact, there's a terrific\nreview that was mentioned\non the podcast with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nThis is a review that we'll\nprovide a citation to,\nand a reference and a link to,\nwhich is the review by Murach\nand Bagley, which talks\nabout whether or not there's interference\nbetween strength and endurance workouts.\nReally interesting review\nif you want to peruse that.\nBut with all that said,\nI like to take Tuesday as a no endurance,\nno resistance training day,\nbut that doesn't mean that\nI'm not doing anything\nfor my overall health and fitness.\nOn Tuesdays, I do a series\nof heat cold contrast.\nIn other words, I get really,\nreally warm and then I\nget really, really cold,\nI get really, really\nwarm and I get really,\nreally cold repeatedly.\nAnd the way I do that is by\ngetting into a hot sauna.\nSo for me, that's really hot,\nbut I've built up my heat conditioning,\nso please don't do this\nunless you've built up\nyour ability to withstand heat.\nAnd I'll get in for about 20 minutes.\nSometimes 15, but usually 20 minutes.\nThen I get out and then I\nwill get into an ice bath\nor a cold water bath\nthat's about 45 to 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nAgain, don't get into water that's so cold\nthat you go into shock.\nI'll explain what a good\ncold stimulus could be\nfor you and how to determine that.\nOr if I don't have access\nto my sauna and my ice bath,\nwhat I can do if I'm\ntraveling is I will take a hot\nbath and then alternate with cold shower,\nhot bath, cold shower.\nIt's hard to do hot bath ice bath\nunless you have two baths.\nI don't know any hotel rooms,\nat least I've never stayed\nin one that has two baths,\nalthough I'm sure they're out there.\nBut for me, this is heat cold contrast.\nAnd really what this day\nis about is two things.\nFirst of all, I'm trying\nto accelerate recovery\nfrom the leg workout I did previously.\nAlso, if you listen to our episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\nabout deliberate heat\nexposure or you listen to our episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\nabout deliberate cold exposure,\nI talk about some of the\nbenefits of heat and cold,\nand I get into a lot of details\nabout how you can access heat.\nYou can do baths, you can do saunas,\nyou can even take hot showers.\nIf you don't have access to any of that,\nyou could even wrap your\nbody from the neck down\nin a garbage bag, plastic\ngarbage bags, believe it or not,\nwrestlers used to do this,\nput on some sweats and go running.\nThat'll get you warm.\nAgain, be careful not to\noverheat and then you can\nget into a cold shower.\nSo there's a lot of ways,\ndepending on your budget\nand what you have access to.\nI don't use cryo, these\ncryotherapy chambers,\nthey're hard to find.\nThey're expensive.\nAgain, I use sauna and\nice bath and I will do\nanywhere from three to five\nrounds, which is a lot,\nanywhere from three to five rounds of heat\nfor about 20 minutes and\ncold for about 5 minutes.\nHow cold should the cold be?\nWe covered this in the episode\non deliberate cold exposure.\nHere's a general rule of thumb.\nIt should be cold enough that\nyou really want to get out,\nbut not so cold that it's unsafe.\nAnd that will vary from person to person.\nSo I cannot give you a\nsimple prescriptive there.\nSame thing with the heat,\nhot enough that you're\nsweating and that you want\nto get out, but not so hot\nthat you're running the risk\nof injuring yourself or killing yourself.\nAnd again, that will vary\nfrom person to person.\nSo you have to build up slowly,\nbe careful and build up empirically.\nI do that on Tuesdays again as a way\nto accelerate recovery and\nbecause it's very clear\nthat there are cardiovascular benefits,\nmaybe even benefits for the brain related\nto the cardiovascular\nbenefits because of course\nthe brain needs a lot of\nblood flow and needs a lot\nof nutrients and other things flowing\ninto and out of there,\ndebris out and nutrients and\nother things into the brain.\nHeat can help accelerate\nthat or improve that.\nAnd so I'm doing that to\nimprove cardiovascular function,\nimprove brain health, and\nthen the cold contrast\nprovides a sort of accelerator\non that or an amplifier\nI think is the better way to phrase it\non that process because in the cold\nyou get vasoconstriction\nand then in the heat\nyou get vasodilation.\nAnd so you're maximizing that process,\nwhich is actually a neural process.\nNerves actually innervate\nthe blood vessels\nand capillaries and even the arteries\nin order to allow that\nconstriction and dilation\nprocess to occur.\nSo Tuesday is really about recovery,\nbut my recovery day isn't necessarily\nabout just laying around\nand not doing anything.\nI might still also take\nsome walks that day.\nRemember, I want to try\nand get that 200 minutes\nof zone two cardio across the week,\nand sometimes, not often,\nbut sometimes I'll get\nin a few minutes or more\nof walking quickly that day.\nBut generally I'm working\na lot on Tuesday as I do\non Monday, and I'm a\nlittle bit tired and maybe\neven a little bit sore from my leg workout\nthe previous day Monday.\nSo I try and get that hot cold contrast.\nThere are other benefits\nto hot and cold contrast.\nWe have a description of\nthe different protocols\nfor hot and for cold and their contrast\nat our Huberman Lab newsletter.\nYou can find that by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com.\nGo to the newsletter tab under the menu\nand you can sign up.\nYou can actually download\nthose protocols very\neasily without even signing\nup if you just want to\naccess them straight off.\nSo Tuesday is really about\nrecovery and about getting\nsome additional cardiovascular benefits\nfrom heat cold contrast.\nOne other thing that's\nbuilt into the rationale\nfor doing a lot of heat and\ncold on one day as opposed\nto doing it every day...\nWell, in addition to it\nbeing a little bit more\nconvenient because certainly\nsome people don't access\nto heat and cold sauna and\ncold dunks et cetera every day.\nSo maybe getting to do\nthat one day is more\naccessible or feasible.\nBut in addition to that,\nit's very clear that\nwhile there are benefits\nto doing sauna often,\nand we talked about this\nin the deliberate heat\nepisode and the episode\nwith Dr. Rhonda Patrick\nwhen she was a guest\non this podcast, it's\nalso clear that if you do\nsauna seldom, that is once a week,\nbut you do a lot of it on\none day, so in this case,\nit's an hour, if it's,\nremember, it's one more,\nit's three to five rounds\nof 20 minutes of sauna\nfollowed by about 5 minutes of cold or so,\nby doing that all on one day,\nthe peer reviewed research that's covered\nin the episode on deliberate heat,\nthis is a study out of Finland,\nshowed that you get massive,\neven 16 fold increases in growth hormone,\nwhich are extremely\nbeneficial for metabolism\nand for recovery.\nSo these massive increases\nin growth hormone are seen\nwhen you are doing these sessions of sauna\nthat are repeated on the\nsame day and you're only\ndoing that about once a week.\nWhereas if you do sauna more often,\nthere are certainly benefits to that,\nbut it's time consuming and\nyou need access to sauna\nmore often than one day\na week if you're doing\nit more than one day a week.\nBut if you do it one day a\nweek and you're doing a lot\nof sessions within that\nday, as I've detailed here,\nyou see these massive\nincreases in growth hormone\nthat are not observed if\nyou're doing sauna more often\nfor the other benefits of sauna.\nNow the effects of cold are many,\nit's not just vasoconstriction,\nbut the effects of cold\nare also counterbalanced\nby some of the problems with\ndeliberate cold exposure\nthat maybe you've heard about\non this podcast and a lot\nof other podcasts and seem\nto be a kind of a buzz theme\non Twitter and elsewhere.\nAnd the point is this,\nthere are a number of\nquality studies showing\nthat if you do deliberate cold exposure,\nin particular ice baths\nor getting into very cold\nwater immediately after an\nendurance training session\nor a strength and hypertrophy\nsession, it can indeed, yes,\nit can disrupt or prevent\nsome of the adaptations\nthat you are seeking with\nstrength and hypertrophy\nand endurance workouts.\nOkay, so you heard that right.\nAnd I believe that to be\ntrue based on now several\nquality peer-reviewed studies.\nSo by doing your deliberate cold exposure\non Tuesday, you're not\ngoing to get those effects,\nthat is the blocking of\nhypertrophy or the blocking\nof strength improvement or\nthe blocking or prevention\nof improvements in\nendurance that would occur\nif you immediately got into the ice bath\nafter a hypertrophy strength\nor endurance workout.\nNow the caveat to that is if\nyou are somebody who likes\nto do cold showers,\nI am not aware of any\ndata that says that cold\nshowers cannot be\nperformed after a strength\nhypertrophy or endurance workout.\nCold showers are different\nthan submersion up\nto the neck in an ice\nbath or another cold body\nof water for a number\nof different reasons.\nIn fact, they tap into different aspects\nof the nervous system entirely.\nWe don't have time to go into that now,\nit's covered in the episode\non deliberate cold exposure,\nbut the simple point is by doing your heat\nand cold contrast, or hey, listen,\nif you're somebody who\ndoesn't have access to sauna\nor you don't like hot\nbaths and you just do\nsome deliberate cold\nexposure on Tuesday, you are\ndoing that separate from\nyour strength and hypertrophy\nand endurance workouts such\nthat it will not impede\nthe benefits of those workouts.\nOkay, so long endurance on\nSunday, leg resistance training\non Monday and on Tuesday,\nheat cold contrast.\nThat brings us to Wednesday.\nAnd on Wednesday we get back\nto a resistance training workout.\nAnd the resistance training\nworkout that I emphasize\non Wednesday is one in\nwhich you train your torso.\nYes, literally your torso.\nI know this is counter to\nthis so-called bro science\nof bro splits.\nI don't know who originated that term,\nit's a terrible term.\nIt essentially alienates\nanyone who's not a bro\nor considers themselves a bro.\nBut in any case,\nthis is not about training\nchest or back or shoulders.\nIn fact, it's really about\nstrengthening the muscles\nof the torso and of\ncourse includes the chest\nand the shoulders and the back.\nAnd I'm sure, as I say this,\na number of people out\nthere who are obsessed\nwith hypertrophy and\nmuscle growth and filling\nout their shirts or whatever\nit may be, are thinking,\noh no, this is just kind\nof all around fitness.\nBut no, the point is,\non Wednesday you train your\ntorso and that's going to\ninvolve some pushing, so that's,\nfor you that might include\nsome training of things\nlike bench presses or\nincline presses as well\nas shoulder presses or lateral raises,\nthings for the shoulders\nas well as for the back,\nsome pulling exercises.\nThese could be bent over\nrows or chin-ups or pull-ups.\nAgain, there are enormous\nnumber of exercise for each\nand every one of these muscle groups.\nNow, I believe there's a\nclear benefit to training\nall these muscle groups\ntogether on the same day,\nbecause much in the same\nway that training legs all\non one day can lead to\nthese systemic effects\nbecause they're large muscle groups,\nworking both the pushing\nmuscles and the pulling\nmuscles of the torso on one day,\nat least in the context of this program,\nis very time efficient,\nand tends to wick out\ninto a number of different dimensions\nof health that at least I'm\ninterested in and I think\na lot of other people are interested in.\nWhat are those?\nWell, let's think again,\nI want to be strong in not just\nmy legs, but my upper body.\nI also may want, may want\nto engage some hypertrophy,\nto grow certain muscle\ngroups in order to create\na sense of balance.\nI could be for aesthetic reasons,\nbut also for balancing\nstrength and for health of,\nand the integrity of\nthe joints, et cetera.\nAnd in addition to that,\nby training a bunch of different\nmuscle groups together,\nyou have the opportunity\nto get the more systemic\nhormonal effects and\nmetabolic effects that occur\nwhen you're not just\ntraining one muscle group\nand isolating that one muscle group,\nbut rather training a bunch\nof muscle groups together.\nSo Wednesday I train torso\nand I do that in push\npull fashion just for\nkind of time efficiency.\nSometimes that means doing\na pushing exercise and then\na pulling exercise.\nSometimes it might even\nmean doing a set of pushing\nand then a set of pulling\nand going back and forth.\nHowever, if you're in a gym,\nin particular, a crowded gym,\nplease don't be one of those people\nthat colonizes multiple\npieces of equipment and says,\nI'm working there, I'm working there,\nand that can be quite a\ndance and it can be hard\nto orchestrate a workout like that.\nSo sometimes it will be\nstarting off with a set\nof shoulder presses and\nthen doing all your sets\nof those and then moving\nto your chin ups and then\nmoving perhaps back to\nshoulders and realizing, ah, oh,\nsomeone's on the machine that I wanted,\nor using the equipment that I wanted,\nso I'll just finish up the pulling,\nI'll finish up the back work\nand then go in to the push.\nI don't obsess over the\nalternation in any kind\nof strict way.\nI really just try and get the\nmuscles of the torso trained.\nAnd again, it's two\nexercises per muscle group.\nAnd one of those exercises\nis going to be something\nwhere there's, I realize this isn't\nphysiologically accurate, but a shortening\nof the muscle or where they,\nat the end of the movement,\nthe muscle is under maximal contraction.\nI could throw out some names of exercises\njust for purpose of understanding.\nSo this would be like cable\ncrossovers for the chest,\nthe peak contraction is at the end,\nwhereas something like an incline press,\nthere's more of a stretch\nprovided it's done\nover a full range of\nmotion at the beginning\nof the movement.\nSo again, something\nwhere there's a stretch\nand something where\nthere's a peak contraction.\nFor the shoulders, it's a\nlittle bit harder to do,\nalthough there are ways to do that.\nAnd Jeff Cavaliere has\nexcellent workouts available,\nzero cost, on YouTube.\nHe also has excellent programs\non his athleanx.com site.\nbut certainly has a lot\nof excellent protocols\non his YouTube and Instagram.\nBut on YouTube you can\nput in his name and any\nmuscle group that you want to train.\nAnd he has some terrific\nvideos describing exercise\nchoice and other features\nof exercise parameters.\nAgain, a peak contraction\nor shortening of the muscle,\npeak contraction exercise\nand a stretching exercise.\nAnd so for the back, one might say, okay,\na seated row or a bent\nover row or a dumbbell row\nwhere the elbow is\nbrought behind the torso\nfor a peak contraction movement.\nAnd then for more of a\nstretching movement might\nbe something like a chin up or a pull-up.\nAnd as I say this,\nI understand that stretching\nand peak contraction\naren't the exact terms that\none would use if they were\na physiotherapist or a strength\nand conditioning coach,\nbut I think for the\ntypical person who's trying\nto generate strength and\nhypertrophy in those muscles\nor maintain strength and\nhypertrophy in those muscles,\nthis kind of nomenclature\nway of describing\nit at least should be\nclear and even efficient.\nAnd just to remind you,\nas with the leg workout,\nthe total duration of the\ntorso workout is going to be\n50 to 60 minutes after a brief warmup.\nThe sets and repetitions\nare going to be dictated\nin the same way that I described earlier.\nSo for about a month it's\ngoing to be more sets.\nSo anywhere from three to five sets\nin the lower repetition range,\nso four to eight repetitions,\nso that's going to be heavier\nweights and longer rest\nas I described earlier,\nthe rest intervals.\nAnd then for the next\nmonth it's going to be\nmoderate repetitions, fewer sets,\nthe same way I described earlier.\nAnd if you want more\ndetails on all of that,\nyou can find that in\nthe newsletter related\nto the optimal or\nfoundational fitness protocol\nthat you can access at hubermanlab.com.\nOne thing I should note\nabout the Wednesday torso\nworkout is that I am a\nbig believer in training\nthe, what I believe is the highly avoided,\nor at least overlooked but\nvitally important aspect\nof total body stability,\nstrength and safety, really,\nsafety, which is the neck.\nNow I realize a lot of people\ndon't want a large neck,\nand I totally understand\nfor aesthetic reasons\nwhy they don't want that.\nIt's kind of interesting\nactually, if you think about it,\nthat people who have a\nlarge neck are often told\nthey have no neck.\nPeople say that guy has no\nneck or they have no neck\nwhen in fact they're referring to the fact\nthat they have a very large neck.\nI don't know how that came to be.\nSomebody put in the comments why that is,\nhow come when people have\na big neck they refer\nto it as no neck.\nSo why do I train the neck?\nI train the neck for a couple of reasons.\nOne is years ago I had an\naccent where I actually fell\noff a roof and I'd been\ntraining my neck at that time\nfor a sport that I was\ninvolved in and I walked\naway from it with a sore\nneck but not a broken neck.\nAnd I thought, wow, it's\nreally great that I have\nbeen training my neck.\nIn addition to that,\nI was once in a car accident\nwhere I was parked...\nI just bought the car, was\nmy first new car purchased,\nparked in that car with my mother,\nmy grandfather in the\nbackseat at the red light\nand someone rammed into us at full speed.\nNow fortunately, none of us\nwere hurt. We were all rattled.\nAnd once again, I was very\nsore in my back and in my neck.\nBut I think one of the\nreasons why I was able\nto essentially walk away from that,\nI didn't have any sustained damage was\nbecause I trained my neck,\nbut I started training my\nneck for sport and I continue\nto train my neck because I\nnotice when I don't train\nmy neck I start getting shoulder issues.\nAnd if you talk to an\nexcellent physiologist like\nDr. Kelly Starrett of The Ready State,\nis an excellent channel,\nyou can find them on all the social media\nand standard channels\nor you talk to anyone\nout there who really\nunderstands the strength\nof the torso and the upper\nbody and even the back.\nWhat you learn is that, of course,\nbeing the upper portion of the spine,\nstabilizing your neck is very important.\nNow, training the neck can\nbe a little bit detailed\nand specific and even\ndangerous if you do it wrong.\nAgain, Jeff Cavaliere has\na terrific set of videos\non training the neck properly.\nI know a lot of people\nout there might think neck\nbridges and I used to do neck bridges.\nI occasionally still sneak in\na neck bridge here or there,\nalthough I don't recommend\nit because in discussions\nwith Jeff, he will tell\nyou, and it's true,\nthat the discs eventually\ngo and you can run\ninto serious issues from doing bridges\nand it doesn't happen\ngradually so you can't\nnotice it happening.\nIt just happens suddenly.\nSo I might occasionally do a neck bridge,\nbut in general I'll train\nneck by wrapping a plate\nin a towel so that I don't\nend up with an imprint\nof the weight value on my head or face.\nAnd then moving the neck\nfrom side to side or front\nor back, and again, we'll\nprovide a link to those videos.\nIt's a terrific set of\nvideos that describe\nhow to train your neck\nproperly and safely.\nSo even if you're not\ntrying to grow your neck,\nyou definitely want to\nmake sure that you use\nsome light weights to\nmake sure that your neck\nis stable and upright.\nAnd I say stable and upright\nbecause it's very clear\nthat for reasons related\nto texting and staring down\nat computers and related\nto weak neck relative\nto the rest of the muscles\nthat stabilize the spine,\na lot of people,\ntheir default stance or\ntheir default posture\nis with chin forward and that's not good.\nNot only is it aesthetically not good,\nbut it also can create all\nsorts of issues related\nto back pain and headaches\nand things of that sort.\nThis is a real thing,\ntraining your neck allows you to stand\nupright, sit upright.\nI even believe that it\nallows you to do things like\npublic speaking or have\nconversations with people\non the street in a way\nwhere you are front facing\nas opposed to looking down.\nSo Wednesday is torso\nand neck and then comes\nThursday and that means\nanother cardiovascular\nexercise session,\nalthough it's a brief one.\nUnlike the endurance training\non Sunday, the cardiovascular session\non Thursday, and again,\nfor me it falls on Thursday,\nbut for it could fall\non a different day depending\non when you started\nthis protocol, is going\nto be about, again,\nabout 35 minutes of, for me, running,\nalthough it could be rowing\nor it could be cycling,\nit could be something of that sort.\nThe goal of this workout\nis what's important.\nThe goal of this workout is to tap into,\nremember that long list\nthat we talked about earlier\nwhere you've got skill and speed and power\nand strength and hypertrophy, et cetera,\ndifferent forms of endurance,\nis to get into that range of endurance\nwhere your heart rate is\nelevated quite a bit more\nthan zone two,\nbut that you're not really\ngoing all out sprint.\nSo what that means for me\nis warming up for about 5\nto 10 minutes.\nThat could be jogging, a little\nbit of light calisthenics,\nmight even be hopping\non a stationary bike,\nalthough to be honest I\nloathe the stationary bike,\nand then setting a timer\nand doing about 30,\nbut ideally 35 minutes of what I call\n75% to 80% of all out.\nOkay, now I realize this\nspits in the face of all\nyou heart rate monitor wearing\nsuper techy exercise types.\nBut when I think of all out\nsprint, I think of 100%.\nAnd what is that?\nIn my mind that's somebody is chasing me\nwith a needle full of\npoison and I am sprinting\naway at maximal speed.\nThat for me is 100%.\nSo after a brief warm up,\nwhat I'm going to do is\ngo out, typically outside,\nalthough sometimes it\nhas to be on a treadmill\nif I'm traveling, and move,\nrun for about 30 to 35 minutes\nat about 75% or 80% of that all out.\nWhat that means is that I'm\nstriving to keep a steady pace,\nbut in reality I don't.\nI sometimes have to stop at\na stoplight, there are cars,\nplease don't run into\ntraffic just to maintain\nthat speed and that timing,\nthat would be terribly\nantagonistic to fitness,\nin particular, lifespan.\nThat running tends to be running\nin which I'm breathing\nhard so I'm not able\nto restrict myself to\npurely nasal breathing.\nAnd I should have mentioned earlier,\non the Sunday long ruck\nor weighted hike or jog,\nif I'm alone, I try and\ndo pure nasal breathing.\nIf I'm with other people or I'm talking,\nobviously I'm not going\nto do pure nasal breathing\nbecause I'm talking, although\nI'm sure that sometimes\nthey wish I was doing\npure nasal breathing.\nThat Thursday workout\naccomplishes a number of things.\nFirst of all, it really\ngets my heart rate up\nand it improves multiple\naspects of endurance,\nbecause as you recall earlier,\nthe different bins of\nendurance that include\nmuscular endurance, anaerobic,\nthat 3 to 12 minute range\nand then 30 minutes or longer,\nnone of them really precisely\nmatch what's accomplished\nin this 35 minute or so\ncardiovascular session\nwhere I'm pushing hard but not all out.\nBut that's exactly the reason to do it,\nwhich is that it taps\ninto multiple fuel systems\nfor the muscle and multiple\naspects of the heart\nand capillaries and\narteries and veins that are\ninvolved in generating that movement.\nSo it really cuts a\nbroad swath into multiple\ncategories of endurance.\nAnd also just keep in mind\nwhat this foundational\nor optimal fitness protocol\nis really designed to do.\nIn my mind, a foundational\nfitness protocol is one\nthat leaves you or has you\nin a state where if you need\nto walk really far and\ncarry a bunch of weight,\nyou can do it.\nIf you need to lift a heavy\nobject with your legs,\nyou can do it.\nIf you need to run really\nfast for two minutes,\nyou can do it.\nAnd if you need to run\na little bit further,\nlike maybe in 10 minutes\nfor whatever reason,\nyou can do that.\nSo it's a really kind of\nall around fitness program\nand that 35 minute run, again,\ncould be swapped with a 35 minute erg row.\nOr sometimes if you only have access\nto a stationary bike, you could do that.\nI suppose if you didn't\nhave access to any equipment\nand running is not your thing,\none thing that I have done,\nespecially if I've been\nstuck in a hotel 'cause\nI arrived late someplace\nand I really want to get\nthis workout in, you could\ndo the dreaded burpee.\nI know there are a lot\nof opinions out there,\nsome people think burpees\nare downright dangerous,\nother people love burpees.\nYou could do that.\nOr you could do really fast\nbut full jumping jacks.\nI know that's a little PE class, right?\nPhysical education class-ish.\nBut sometimes if I need\nto get the workout in,\nwhat I'll do in a hotel\nif I've arrived late\nin particular day of travel\nis I will find the stairwell,\nthe fire stairwell, I'll\nmake sure by the way\nthat I can get back into the\nbuilding 'cause I've been\nlocked in those stairwells before.\nAnd I will simply walk\nreally fast up the stairwell\nas many flights of stairs as there are,\nor maybe even jog it, not quite sprint,\nbut a run up those stairs\nover and over and over again\nin order to get that 35\nminutes of 75% to 80%\nof max output cardiovascular work done.\nAnd if I'm really just\nrestricted to my hotel room,\nI'll just do jumping\njacks for 30, 35 minutes,\nsometimes while watching something on TV.\nAnd believe me, if you're\ndoing full jumping jacks,\nlike really extending your legs,\nreally getting arms\noverhead and really doing\nthe full movement, by the\ntime you hit five or six\nminutes you are going to be\nsweating and your heart rate\nis really going to be up.\nI also sometimes will\ntravel with a jump rope.\nI always try and travel with\na jump rope and skip rope,\nmuch to the dismay of\nthe people who are housed\nbelow me in the hotel room.\nSkipping rope, I should mention,\ncan be a very effective way of getting\ncardiovascular training\nwhile you're on the road.\nBut in all seriousness,\nif you're in a hotel room or an apartment\nand you can't really jump\nhigh and you're very good\nat jumping rope, what you'll\nfind is it's not going to\nget you into that higher\nelevated heart rate zone.\nOkay?\nIt can be great for\nzone two type training,\nbut if you're really\ngood at skipping rope,\nand I wouldn't say I'm really good at it,\nbut I've done enough skipping\nrope that I can just kind\nof cruise and talk and\nit, it's more zone twoish,\neven feels like walking at times.\nNow you can do double unders\nwhere you're really jumping\nand putting the rope\nunder you twice each time\nor crossovers, et cetera,\ndepending on your skill level.\nBut again, if you're in an\napartment or you're in a hotel,\nthat's going to be harder to do.\nAnd because there's some skill involved,\nsometimes you're stopping more often\nthan you're continuing.\nBy the way, and I just\nhave to mention this,\na really terrific Instagram\nchannel is @anna.skips.\nThis is a teacher, a science teacher,\nor I believe it's a math,\nmaths as they say in the\nUK 'cause she's in the UK,\nmaths teacher.\nI don't know Anna, but I\nknow she skips 'cause she has\nthis amazing Instagram\nchannel called Anna Skips.\nAnd what's really cool\nabout her Instagram is she\nshows you her progression\nfrom not being able to skip rope at all\nto the absolutely incredible\ntypes of rope skipping\nthat she's doing each morning\nwhile getting sunlight,\nwhich of course is\nessential health protocol.\nSo check out Anna Skips on\nInstagram, really inspiring\nand made me want to get\nbetter at skipping rope.\nI'm still working at it.\nOkay, so with that\nThursday cardiovascular,\nlet's call it endurance,\nbut cardiovascular training workout done,\naround roles Friday and\non Friday I'm going to do\nanother cardiovascular training session,\nand I alluded to this earlier,\nbut this cardiovascular\ntraining session is also\ndesigned to tap into some\nof the ability of hard,\nI should say high intensity\ninterval training,\nto tap into strength and\nhypertrophy increases\nfor the legs.\n'Cause remember, we train legs\non Monday and what the science tells us\nis that protein synthesis\nin a muscle group can\nbe stimulated about every 42 to 72 hours.\nAnd so we've had Tuesday off,\nWednesday off and Thursday\noff and you don't want to\nlose progress that you\nmade from that terrific\nMonday leg workout.\nBut in order to make sure\nthat you can do the other\nthings that follow in this\nprogram and pick back up\non Monday with another leg workout,\nat least for me with my recovery abilities\nand my work schedule,\nI'm not going to do an\nentire other leg workout\nbecause it's going to set\nthe whole thing out of whack.\nThat is, I won't be\nable to consistently do\nthe same workouts on the\nsame days of each week.\nNow with that said,\na little bit later I'll\nexplain what happens\nif you have to miss a workout\nand how you can combine\ndays, et cetera.\nBut I really strive to\nget certain workouts done\non certain days consistently\nat least as best I can.\nSo Friday is high intensity\ninterval training,\nand that can take a\nvariety of different forms.\nFor me, the ideal thing\nto do, for me, again,\nyou could do something\ncompletely different.\nExercise choice, again, should be governed\nby what you can do safely\nso you don't injure yourself\nand that you can perform\neffectively and that gets\nyou or provides you the\nstimulus that you want.\nAnd what I'm trying to do\non Friday is get my heart\nrate way, way up.\nTalked about this in the\nepisode with Dr. Andy Galpin.\nIn addition to the benefits\nof getting 180-200 minutes\nof zone two cardio per week, minimum,\nit's a really good idea to\nget up to that max or near max\nheart rate at least once a week.\nAnd you're not going to do that\nfor very long periods of time.\nYou're not going to do\nthat for 30 minutes.\nYou can't sprint all out for 30 minutes\nunless you're Steve Prefontaine.\nIf you haven't seen\nthe movies \"Without\nLimits\" or \"Prefontaine,\"\nyou should absolutely see those.\nHe was able to go out and run 12 laps,\nwhat seemed to be an all\nout sprint or close to it.\nIncredible.\nBut most people are not\ngoing to do that or going\nbe carried away on a\nstretcher if they try.\nThese high intensity\ninterval training for me\nideally would be on so-called\nassault bike or Airdyne bikes.\nSo these bikes that have the\nfan, which might seem like,\noh, just cools you off,\nbut actually there's a\nlot of resistance there.\nSo what I will typically\ndo is a 20 to 30 second\nall out sprint using arms and\nlegs and then 10 seconds rest\nand then repeat all out sprint for 20\nto 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat.\nAnd I'll do that for anywhere\nfrom 8 to 12 rounds, which,\ntrust me, even if you start\nout a little bit less,\nor I should say not all\nout intensity or effort,\nby the time you hit\nthe fifth or sixth one,\nyou will be certainly\nheaded into if not near\nyour maximum heart rate.\nNow what is your maximum heart rate?\nDo you need a heart rate monitor? No.\nIf you like using that\nsort of thing, great.\nBut again, Andy Galpin\nbeautifully supplied us\nwith the information.\nHe said if you take the\nnumber 220 and you subtract\nyour age, that for most people, most,\nis going to be your maximum heart rate.\nAlthough for certain\npeople who are very fit\nor certain ages, that's\nnot going to apply.\nSo it's a little bit too crude to measure,\nbut it's a good starting\nplace and you can look up\nother information or see\nthat podcast episode,\nwe provide the link to it\nin the show note captions\nif you want to get more details on that.\nI don't use a heart rate monitor.\nWhat I'm trying to do is get to that point\nwhere I quote unquote\nfeel like I want to die.\nNow I don't want to die,\nand please don't die, right?\nIf you're not in good\ncardiovascular health,\ndo not just jump right\ninto this fitness protocol.\nBut I want to get to the\npoint where I really feel like\nI could not pedal any\nfaster or pull any faster\non the assault bike, the Airdyne bike,\nor if I'm doing this workout\nin a place or at a time\nor because I choose to\nnot use a bike or a rower,\n'cause you could also use a rower,\nI will simply do sprint jog intervals.\nI will sprint for 20 or 30 seconds,\nthen jog for 10 seconds,\nsprint for 20 or 30 seconds,\nand then jog for 10\nseconds and just repeat.\nI used to have a big field\nnext to my laboratory,\nmy old laboratory, and I\nused to bring my bulldog\nCostello out there.\nHe was really good at the\nfirst sprint part and then\nhe would just lie down and watch.\nhe didn't even do the jog part.\nI would just go back and\nforth, back and forth,\nback and forth, panting\nlike a bulldog nonstop,\nbarely able to recover\nbefore sprinting again.\nAnd the basis of this workout\nagain is several fold.\nFirst of all, it's to get\nthe heart rate really high,\nup towards maximum heart\nrate at least once a week.\nSo you accomplish that this Friday.\nAlso, if you are\nsprinting and then jogging\nor you are really pushing\nhard on an assault bike\nor an Airdyne bike, or\nusing a, for instance,\na skier or a skier machine or any number\nof different cardiovascular\ntraining tools,\nyou are going to get\nactivation of the legs,\nof course not to the\nsame degree as you would\nwith squats or dead lifts or\nleg extensions or leg curls.\nThat's simply not the case.\nBut you're going to trigger\nstrength and hypertrophy\nand other types of adaptations\nin those muscle groups.\nSo this for me also represents\nthe second leg workout\nof the week where I'm\nnot touching any weights.\nOne important point that\nI don't think I've heard\nmentioned anywhere else,\nbut that I hope to have\nDr. Kelly Starrett on\nthe podcast to discuss\nand that I've discussed\nwith him one on one,\nwhich is be careful with\nall out sprints or all\nout anything cardiovascular exercise,\nyou can get injured doing those.\nSo for instance, if you\ngo out and you just sprint\nacross a field, all out,\n20 or 30 seconds and\nthen walk back and can do\nit again and again,\ndon't be surprised if the\nnext day you have some\nsciatica or even some pelvic floor pain.\nI don't recommend going\nall out on any movement\nthat you can't perform with perfect form.\nOkay?\nSo for me, I really try and\nstay away from all out sprints.\nI'll sprint it about 95% of what I can do\nbecause I find if I go all out sprint,\nI don't know what the reason is,\nbut it might be an over\nextension of a limb\nor something like that,\nI'm not a sprinter,\nI'm not a sprinting coach.\nI do hope to get Stu McMillan\non here or Dan Pfaff,\nwho are excellent sprinting coaches,\nat some point they were world\nclass sprinting coaches,\nbut I'm not a pro sprinter,\nI'm not even a amateur sprinter,\nI'm a fitness sprinter.\nSo the Airdyne or assault\nbike or the rower is really\na safer option for me.\nAnd if I'm running or I'm doing some sort\nof movement where I'm\nunconstrained, really,\nin terms of how far my stride is,\nI mean I'm obviously\nconstrained by the musculature,\nI'm really careful to not overextend or do\nsomething like that.\nAnd the only way to do\nthat is to not go all out.\nSo again, the goal for this Friday workout\nis to really get the heart rate high,\ndo high intensity interval training...\nA number of different\nways you could do that.\nYou can look up HIIT,\nHIIT workouts online,\nfind the one that's best\nfor you and really pick\nsomething that's safe that\nyou can do consistently,\nand I believe that ideally\nwill also trigger a bit\nof either strength and\nhypertrophy and speed\npower maintenance or even\ngive you a little bit\nof a stimulus so that by\nthe time you roll around\nto that leg workout on,\nagain, on Monday, you've got\na little bit of an additional\nboost to your leg strength,\nhypertrophy, speed and power.\nSo we've covered Sunday\nthrough Friday, and then\nSaturday rolls around and\nSaturday is when you train arms,\ncalves, and neck.\nSo this may sound as if\nyou're training a bunch\nof small muscle groups, biceps,\ntriceps, necks and calves,\nand that's true, but I\nshould mention that you are\nalso training your torso a\nsecond time and you're doing\nit indirectly, or\nsometimes not indirectly.\nWhy do I say this?\nWell, keep in mind, again,\nthat for strength and hypertrophy,\nyou're going for that once\nabout every 48 to 72 hours,\nyou want to stimulate that,\non Wednesday is when you\ntrain your torso, right?\nChest, shoulders, back and neck.\nYou've had Thursday to\nrest, Friday to rest.\nI know a lot of people are\ngoing to want to emphasize\nthose body parts and\nthey're going to think,\noh, you have to train it twice a week.\nBut if you have modest recovery ability\nor low recovery ability, such as I do,\nand you're doing these\nother cardiovascular\ntraining sessions, et cetera,\nwell then, on Saturday is\nwhen you will train arms,\ncalves and neck directly.\nBut included in that,\nremember, two exercises per muscle group,\none with a peak contraction,\none with somewhat of a stretch in there.\nIncluded in that, I\nsuggest doing some sort\nof dip movement, which I\nthink it was Pavel Tsatsouline\nsaid the dip is synonymous\nwith or at least similar\nto an upper body squat.\nExcuse me, Pavel if I got that wrong.\nMaybe it wasn't you that said that,\nbut big admirer of his work,\nand certainly the dip is\na great exercise to hit\nmultiple muscle groups,\nchest, shoulders, and triceps,\nmaybe even some back to\nsome extent depending\non how you do it.\nSo doing some dipping\nmovement will indirectly\nstimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera,\nin the chest and shoulders\nand including some sort\nof pulling movement for the bicep,\nlike a chin up or palms facing movement,\npulling up from to the bar,\nespecially if it's a\nclose grip type movement.\nBut even if it's a wide\ngrip type movement,\nwill of course trigger strength\nand hypertrophy, maintenance\nor improvements in the biceps,\nbut will also trigger strength\nhypertrophy in the lats\nin the back.\nOkay, so Saturday is this arm workout\nthat I'll just give an\nexample of a potential\nworkout where you might\ndo a few more exercises\nand maybe not just two,\nbut maybe three to make sure you get\nthe torso indirect stimulation.\nSo what would this look like?\nWell, this might be your\nsort of classic dumbbell\ncurls for the bicep and maybe incline curl\nfor the bicep because\nit has more of a stretch\non an incline bench,\nand then you might finish\nwith two sets of chin ups.\nSo palms facing you, chin ups,\nor three sets of chin-ups depending\non whether or not you're\nin a heavier load month\nor a more moderate weight month.\nAgain, activating the biceps\nmuscles 'cause arms day,\nbut also activating\nstrength and hypertrophy\nin the lats or at least maintaining it\nso that, because you're not training\nthose torso muscles again\nuntil Wednesday, you're not\nallowing the hypertrophy\nand strength gains that you generated\non Wednesday to atrophy, to disappear.\nThen, thinking about triceps,\nit might be some sort of triceps isolation\nor peak contraction movement.\nSo that could be tricep kickback or some\noverhead extension would\nbe more of a stretch\ntype movement than a kickback.\nBut then also doing regular old dips.\nYou might even start\nwith dips, which again,\nare going to activate those\ntorso muscles and the triceps.\nAnd then calf work in the same\nway that you did on Monday.\nAnd neck work...\nAgain, I am a believer\nin training neck multiple\ntimes per week.\nAnd if you are able to\nfinish all of that in 45\nor 50 minutes, great.\nMost people will find\nwhen you're doing a lot\nof small muscle groups,\nit actually takes longer\nbecause you have to go around\nto more exercises.\nBut again, just adhere\nto the same principles\nwe talked about before,\nabout 50, five zero, to\n60 minutes of real work\nafter a warmup with an\nasterisk next to that,\nthat if someone's on the\nequipment or you can't find\nthe dumbbells you need, et cetera,\nthen maybe 75 minutes max.\nBut really trying to not\nextend that workout too long,\nmaking sure that you\nactivate the arms directly,\nbut also activating the\ntorso muscles indirectly,\nand again, I won't repeat\nit this time, again,\nbut following the same\nweight and repetition\nand rest interval scheme\nthat we talked about earlier,\na bit heavier, lower reps,\nmore sets and longer\nrest for about a month.\nAnd then alternating to more repetitions\nyet fewer sets, right?\nShorter rest intervals and\ndo that for about a month.\nThis carries through\nfor all the resistance\ntraining workouts regardless\nof the day of the week.\nSo we've completed the\ntotal arc across the week\nand we can summarize\nit as saying Sunday is,\nlet's just say long endurance,\nMonday is leg resistance training,\nTuesday, heat cold contrast,\nWednesday, torso training plus neck,\nThursday, I would call\nit moderate intensity\ncardiovascular exercise, so that 35 minute\nmoderate intensity\ncardiovascular exercise,\nFriday, high intensity\ninterval training of sprinting\nor some variation thereof\nand Saturday, arms, calves,\nneck and torso, indirect work.\nThat's the total structure.\nBut I want to emphasize again,\nyou do not need to start this on Sunday.\nThat is, you could make the\nlong endurance work start\non Tuesday and then just fill in the rest\nas described before.\nIt's really up to you.\nThere's another important\npoint I want to make,\nwhich is that neither\nI nor anyone is going\nto be successful in\ndoing the exact workouts\non the exact same days of\nevery week because of travel,\nwork, illness, other demands, et cetera.\nThe thing about the\nschedule that I like so much\nthat I do believe that\nwill benefit you as well\nis that you have some flexibility there.\nWhat's the flexibility?\nWell, let's say you train\nyour typical Sunday workout\nof endurance, then you train\nlegs on Monday and then\nyou don't manage to do\nyour heat cold contrast\non Tuesday for whatever reason.\nWell, you can put it on Wednesday.\nJust make sure that if you're going to do\nthe cold stimulus, that\nyou don't do it too close,\nnot within four, ideally\neight hours after the training\nof torso, but you could do\nit before or you could do it\njust heat and skip the cold\nthat particular week, right?\nNot ideal, but better\nthan not doing anything.\nLet's say, for instance,\nthe leg workout was particularly brutal,\nyou don't sleep that well on\nMonday night or Tuesday night.\nWell then should you do the\ntorso workout on Wednesday?\nWell, I would say,\nwhy not move the heat cold contrast\nto Wednesday and then\npush that torso workout\nto Thursday and maybe also\ntry and do that 35 minute\nrun on Thursday every once\nin a while rather than lose\nthe total control of the program and let\neverything shuffle forward.\nHere's the basic principle.\nI do believe that any\none of these workouts,\nwhether it's for endurance\nor resistance training,\ncan be shifted either\none day forward or one\nday back, right?\nYou could delay it by a\nday or you could accelerate\nit by a day in order to\nmake sure that you get\neverything done across the week.\nIn fact, I would say the best way to think\nabout this foundational\nfitness program is not\nfrom the details up,\nbut from the top down,\nfrom the big picture down to the details,\nand say to yourself,\nonce a week you're going to\nget some long endurance in,\nanother day during the week,\nyou're going to make\nsure that you get a kind\nof moderate faster endurance workout in,\nand then one other day during the week,\nyou're going to get an all out sprint,\nhigh intensity cardiovascular\nexercise workout in.\nYou're going to get those\nthree workouts in somehow.\nAnd then in addition to that,\nyou will also do resistance training\nfor every muscle group in your body.\nAnd that means doing your legs\nhard at least once a week,\nyour torso hard at least once\na week and your arms hard\nat least once a week.\nAnd of course you are\nalso paying attention\nto training your calves.\nAnd I do, for reasons I described before,\nbelieve that you want to\ntrain your neck at least\nto keep it strong.\nYou may not want to\ngenerate hypertrophy there.\nPeople vary in terms of how\nquickly their neck grows.\nSome people grows very, very fast.\nOther people, for the life of them,\nthey can't get much\nhypertrophy in their neck.\nBut keeping that neck strong,\nat least through some very\nlight work to moderate\nweight work, very, very important,\nfor reasons I stated earlier.\nIf you set out those goals,\nthen the specific days that\nyou do each workout isn't\nas critical, but the specific spacing is.\nSo for instance, you're\nnot going to want to do\nyour high intensity\ninterval training the day\nafter you train your legs,\nbecause if you're doing\nthat high intensity\ninterval training correctly,\nyou're going to be\ntaxing your legs and\neating into their recovery.\nAnd so you want to space them\nout by two or three days.\nSo I think you'll notice\nthat the point is really\nto optimize everything on\nthe whole rather than any\none specific aspect of\ntraining or adaptation.\nNow that said, I do realize\nthat some people might\nbe hyper focused on things like strength\nand hypertrophy and the\naesthetics that come with it.\nA key point about strength hypertrophy\nand weight training, and this is something\nthat has been covered\non multiple podcasts,\ncertainly the one with Jeff Cavaliere\nand with Dr. Andy Galpin and the one\nthat I did on building muscle\nstrength and hypertrophy,\nthe solo episode.\nAnd that is the following,\nit is the rare individual\nwho has perfectly\nbalanced musculature, right?\nMost people can be a bit quad dominant\nor hamstring dominant,\nor they have trouble\nactivating their glutes\nor somebody has a terrible\ntime trying to activate\ntheir chest muscles,\nbut they're very strong\nin the back, et cetera.\nIt's very clear that we can\nknow that not just based\non aesthetics, right, but based\non deliberate contractibility\nof those muscles.\nSo I don't want to get into\nthis in too much detail\nfor sake of time,\nbut this is something that\nhas peer reviewed research\nto support it and was\nalso discussed extensively\nwith Jeff Cavaliere when he was a guest.\nAnd that actually he's really\npopularized this notion\nand it's absolutely true,\nwhich is that if you can\ncontract a muscle very hard\nto the point where it almost\nfeels like it's cramping,\nif you can do that even\nwhen there's no weight\nin your hand or there's\nno resistance against it,\nso you're just using your\nmind muscle connection\nto contract that muscle\nhard and isolate it,\nchances are you'll be able\nto generate hypertrophy\nand strength gains pretty\neasily in that muscle\ncompared to muscles that you\nhave a harder time activating.\nSo during all resistance\ntraining, that mind muscle link\nis really important, so much\nso that some people will\neven try and emphasize\ncontraction of the muscles\nin between sets, et cetera.\nI personally, because I'm\nnot somebody who likes\na mirror when I work out, and\nI'm not somebody who wants\nto spend time in between\nsets flexing muscles\nand et cetera for whatever reason,\nI want to actually rest between sets,\nand I'm more concerned with performance\nduring those sets and\nreally putting my mind\ninto the muscle during the set,\nI really try and emphasize\ndeep relaxation between sets.\nAnd so here's a tool that again is built\nout of science and I should\nsay peer reviewed studies,\nsome of which are being done in my lab,\nbut other labs as well,\nwhich is that in between\nsets what I really strive\nto do is to bring my heart\nrate down as much as possible,\ncalm myself down as much as possible,\nand I'll do the so-called\nphysiological sigh in order\nto do that.\nThat's two inhales through the\nnose, back to back, [sighs]\nand then long full\nexhale through the mouth.\nI just did it partially there\nfor the sake of time, again.\nSo a big deep inhale through\nthe nose and then sneak\nin a little bit more on a second inhale\nto maximally inflate the\nlungs and the alveoli\nin the lungs, and then a\nfull exhale of all your air\nvia the mouth to empty your lungs.\nThat's the fastest way that\nwe are aware of to calm\nyour nervous system down.\nAnd really, in between sets you can use\nthat to calm yourself\ndown and conserve energy.\nBut then as you move into\nthe weight training set,\nyou really want to ratchet\nup your focus and attention\nto the muscles that\nyou're going to be using.\nNow, I'd like to acknowledge\nthat there's a huge range\nof parameters in terms of\nhow to actually perform\nduring the set.\nYou can focus on a\nparticular muscle and try\nand really isolate from the\nbeginning of the movement.\nSome people will really\ntry and isolate it only\nduring the peak contraction.\nSome people accentuate the negative.\nThere's speed and cadence.\nThere are, again,\nremember, concepts are few,\nmethods are many.\nAnd if you're interested\nin the various methods\nof eccentrics and concentrics\nand all the different\nways of changing up cadence\nand so forth during sets,\nthere's an enormous amount\nof quality information\nout there, far too much for\nus to get into detail now.\nBut what I describe the general principles\nof how to set your mind, if\nyou will, during the set,\nyou should be focused on the\nmuscles that you're using\nand or moving the weight.\nIf movement of the\nweight is more important,\nyou can either focus on moving the weight\nor challenging muscles, right?\nYou can either try and\nisolate muscles and make\nspecific muscles do the work\nor simply moving the weight.\nMoving the weight is\ngoing to be more geared\ntowards strength\nimprovements, but focusing\non the muscle, so called\nmind muscle link is going to\nshift that very same set\nmore toward hypertrophy.\nI realize I'm painting\nwith a broad brush here,\nbut nonetheless this\nis grounded in the way\nthat the nervous system\ngoverns muscular contraction.\nAnd while I think most people are familiar\nwith the number of different\nvariables associated\nwith the resistance training,\nsets, reps, rest intervals,\ncadence, et cetera, there\nare also a tremendous number\nof very important variables\nfor endurance in any kind\nof cardiovascular training.\nAnd there are a lot of excellent resources\nout there about that.\nI think the most important one,\nin fact I will go on record\nsaying what I believe\nto be the most important\nvariable for any endurance\nor cardiovascular training\nis that because it's\na repetitive movement,\nthat you are able to\ncomplete the movement safely,\nmeaning you're not putting\nyour body into range\nof motion or into positions\nthat can damage joints\nor put you in any kind\nof compromised state.\nAnd some people might think, well,\nthat seems kind of silly.\nBut if you've ever set the, for instance,\nthe seat too high on a\nstationary bike and then\ndone Airdyne or assault bike\ntype interval training sprints,\nif it's set too high and you're\nover-striding, as it were,\nthe next day, you can really\npay the price in terms\nof some back pain or sciatica.\nAnd sometimes that pain can\nextend for quite a while.\nSo of course you don't want\nto approach any exercise\nwith so much caution that\nit's neurotic and preventive\nand yet you don't want to\napproach any exercise in any way\nthat's so cavalier,\nforgive the pun, Jeff,\nthat you're also going to\ncompromise the integrity of your joints\nand musculature and connective tissue.\nLet's talk about some real\nworld practical variables.\nFor instance,\nlet's say you get a poor\nto terrible night's sleep.\nShould you train the next day or not?\nWell, that really depends.\nI can honestly say I've\nhad some of the best\ntraining sessions, resistance training\nor endurance training\nsessions after a really\npoor night's sleep.\nBut that's the rare event.\nMore often than not, if\nI'm not sleeping well,\nI've had a terrible night's sleep,\nthe next day I will just\nskip training that day.\nI know that will shock a\nnumber of you out there,\nor perhaps you're\nalready calling me names,\nweak, et cetera.\nBut I find that if I've slept\nreally poorly or I've had\na very stressful event\nthe day before and I don't\nsleep well, training\nthe next day sets me up\nfor getting ill and getting\nill sets me up for not\nbeing able to train for multiple days.\nSo it is my preference in\nthat case to skip a day\nand really focus on recovery.\nAnd then, as I mentioned earlier,\nslide that workout to the\nnext day and rarely double\nthat workout up with another workout,\nbut then just slide the\nschedule forward by a day.\nBut I really try and strive,\nthat is, I really try to\ndouble up at least some\nworkouts later in the week in that case,\nso that I can get back\non schedule of starting\nthe seven day protocol\nagain on the same day.\nI don't want to be\nexcessively vague there.\nWhat I'm trying to say is I try and adhere\nto the same schedule, but if\nI get a poor night's sleep,\nI'll just simply skip\nthe workout the next day,\nslide the workout forward.\nThere is one exception to that,\nand it's an important exception,\nwhich is there are times\nwhen I've not slept well\nor I've had some\nparticularly stressful event\nthe day before and haven't slept well,\nbut I'm able to do so-called NSDR,\nnon-sleep deep rest the next day.\nSo there have been times\nwhen I've only got three\nor four hours of sleep the night\nbefore and I'm feeling\nreally behind the ball\nthe next morning, but I really\nwant to get my workout in.\nSo instead what I will\ndo is a 10, but ideally\nin that case a 30 or even 60\nminute non-sleep deep rest.\nAnd there's a 10 minute\nnon-sleep deep breath protocol read by me.\nBut it is a non-spiritual, non-mystical,\nscience-supported non-sleep\ndeep breath protocol\navailable on YouTube.\nYou can simply put my\nname, Huberman, put NSDR,\nand Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N,\ninto YouTube and you'll find that script.\nThere are other NSDR scripts\nthat you can find now\non Spotify and on YouTube.\nAnd if you fall asleep\nduring those non-sleep deep\nrest scripts, that's great.\nAnd if you don't,\nyou will also find that it\nwill restore your ability\nto perform mental and physical work.\nSo there are times when I\nhaven't gotten as much sleep\nas I would like,\nor I'm feeling a bit more\nstressed for whatever reason,\nand I'll do NSDR, and\nthen I will go train.\nAnd that often works\nfabulously well for me.\nAnd then I don't have to\nskip a workout entirely\njust because I didn't\nget a good night's sleep.\nA lot of people ask whether\nor not you should train\nfasted or fed, and this is\na very controversial area.\nI personally prefer to\ndo my cardiovascular work\nnot having eaten anything\nin the previous 3 to 10 hours.\nAnd typically that's because\nI wake up and I'll do\nthe cardiovascular training\nwithin about an hour\nof waking up, sometimes later,\nbecause my first meal\ngenerally falls, generally,\nnot always, falls around 11:00 AM.\nI don't do any kind of\nformal intermittent fasting,\nbut typically my meal schedule\nsomewhere between 11:00 a.m.\nand my last bite of\nfood is around 8:00 p.m.\nbut I'm not super strict about that.\nI might eat in as late\nas 9:00 p.m. and I might\neat something at 10:00 a.m.\nif I wake up really hungry,\nI might have something\nbefore 11:00 a.m., I'm not\nneurotic about it.\nBut in terms of training,\nI like to train fasted and that includes\nthe resistance training\nworkouts and those come early\nin the day for me.\nAnd typically if I'm going to train legs\non Monday, for instance,\nwhich is when I train legs,\nI'll make sure that the\nnight before I'm ingesting\nsome starch, some carbohydrate,\nlike rice or pasta or\nsomething of that sort to make\nsure that when I do that\nmorning leg workout,\nI have enough glycogen in\nthe muscles, et cetera.\nAgain, nutrition is a\nsomewhat controversial area.\nIn fact, it can evoke very\nstrong feelings 'cause\nI know we've got vegans\nand we've got omnivores\nand we've got carnivores\nand people who are keto.\nThis isn't really the format for us to get\ninto all of that.\nI think the rule to follow is figure\nout what optimizes your training\nfor your particular training goals.\nFor me, that most often\nmeans training fasted\nand then eating pretty soon after I train.\nAnd if it's a high intensity\nresistance training workout,\nand frankly, all of my\nresistance training workouts\nare pretty high intensity,\nI'm not going to failure on\nevery set, but at least, say,\nabout 30% of those sets\nI'm going to failure.\nAnd the other sets I'm\nworking very hard nonetheless,\nwell then I eat some\nstarches after I train\nand I also ingest some protein in the form\nof a protein drink or a meal that includes\nsome protein food.\nBut I don't like to eat before\nI do resistance training\nor at least not within the hour or two\nbefore I do resistance training.\nThere are exceptions to that,\nand I should say that the\nsame basically applies\nto endurance work.\nIf I'm going to head out for a run,\ntypically I don't want my\nbelly full of food or any\nfood at all, but there\nare times where I wake up\nhungry and I very much\nneed to eat something\nor I have something\nscheduled socially like\na breakfast and I'll have\nthat breakfast and then\nan hour or 90 minutes\nlater I'll do my workout\nbecause I want to make sure\nthat I finish the workout.\nI, again, am not neurotically\nattached to training\nfasted or fed.\nFor me, fasted is preferred,\nbut if I have to train fed,\nbetter to train than to not train at all.\nWe haven't talked so much\nabout flexibility yet,\nbut we did an entire episode\nof the Huberman Lab podcast\non flexibility and I\nencourage you to check\nout that episode if you're interested\nin increasing your flexibility.\nBut the basic takeaway from that episode\nis that if you look at what\nI like to call the center\nof mass of the research,\nthat is most of the studies\nand what the conclusions\nof most of the quality studies point to,\nso not the exceptions,\nbut the kind of general\nrules that have been gleaned\nover time from multiple labs over multiple\ndecades, et cetera.\nWhat you find is that static stretching,\nthat is, holding a stretch\nand in fact exhaling\nand relaxing the midsection\nand torso and relaxing\ninto the stretch as opposed\nto staying full of air\nand tense, but mentally\nand physically relaxing\ninto the stretch, but\nnot stretching maximally,\nthat is not extending as\nfar as you possibly can go,\nbut more like 60% or even less.\nAnd then holding those\nstatic stretches for anywhere\nfrom 30 to 60 seconds and then repeating,\ndoing that two or three\ntimes throughout the week\nfor multiple muscle groups,\nso it could be for your quadriceps,\ncould be for hamstrings, for your lats.\nThere are protocols out there.\nIn fact, we have a newsletter\nthat is focused entirely\non protocols for\nflexibility and stretching.\nYou can find that again\nby going hubermanlab.com.\nYou don't even need to\nsign up for the newsletter,\nalthough we invite you to if you like,\nbut you can simply go there,\nscroll down to the\nflexibility newsletter and all\nthe protocols are there\nfor each of the muscle\ngroups, et cetera.\nBut what I typically try\nand do is some stretching\nin the evening, because\nI train in the morning,\nas I'm perhaps getting ready\nfor bed or if the TV is on,\nwhich in our house doesn't typically go\non because we don't\nhave a TV, but of course\nthere are computers and people are\non their computers, et cetera.\nWell, I'll try and do some\nstretching while I do that.\nI also have a standing desk,\nso during the day at work,\nregardless of whether or not\nI train that morning or not,\nor I'm going to train in the afternoon,\nI'll try and do some static\nstretching for my hamstrings,\nmy quads, my lats, my shoulders, my back,\nreally doesn't take much\ntime and I really try\nto space that out\nthroughout the week, which,\nif you look at the peer reviewed research,\nmatches well to what's\nknown to be most effective,\nwhich are going to be short,\nrepeated sessions ideally every day.\nBut truth told, I fail.\nI categorically fail.\nI was about to think of\nwhether or not I ever\nstretch every day.\nI fail to do it every day,\nbut I get about three or\nso stretching sessions\nin per week.\nAnd again, it's just static hold,\ntrying to really relax into the stretch.\nNow the relax into the\nstretch is something\nhas been talked about\nin martial arts circles\nand Pavel Tsatsouline has an\nexcellent book on stretching,\nwe can provide a link to\nthat, talks about this,\nhas a lot to do with relaxation\nof the nervous system\nand the way that the\nnerves innervate muscles\nand allow for stretch, if you will.\nAlso, the way that the\ntendons and ligaments\nare innervated by nerves.\nThe converse is also true.\nAnd here, again, this is\na principle that Pavel has\nput forth, I believe he\ncalls it irradiation,\nmeaning irradiating out or\nemanating out from a source,\nwhich is that while exhaling\nand relaxing the torso,\nthe midsection, some\npeople call it the core,\nalthough some people don't like that term,\ncan facilitate relaxation and stretching\nthrough a larger range of motion.\nSo too can contracting\nthe core, the midsection,\nor gripping very tightly with the fist can\nfacilitate muscular\ncontraction because of the way\nthat the nervous system heavily,\nwe can even say over-represents\nthe fists in the brain.\nAnd so how would you apply\nthis to your overall\nfoundational fitness protocol?\nWell, it turns out that, let's say,\nyou're doing a movement that\ninvolves one limb moving\nand then the other, let's\nsay it's bicep curls,\njust for sake of example,\nturns out that you will\nactually be stronger\nin moving that dumbbell\nwith the arm that happens\nto be moving if you grip\nthe handle very tightly,\nbut also grip the handle of the opposite\ndumbbell very tightly.\nNow that said, in between sets,\nI encourage you to do the opposite.\nTo try and completely\nrelax in between sets,\ncombine that with the physiological sigh,\nand then when the set,\nthe next set commences,\nemploy that very strong grip, both, again,\nof the weight that's moving and the weight\nthat at that moment might be stationary\nor in isometric position.\nSo the nervous system, of course,\nis what controls muscles and that operates\nin both directions.\nIf you want to relax,\ntry and use long exhales,\nmaybe even physiological\nsighs and really concentrate\non mentally and physically relaxing,\nin particular your core and your fists.\nAnd if you want to generate force, right,\nyou want to move a heavy\nbarbell or dumbbell,\nyou want to do a chin up\nwith the maximal force,\nthat's when you can employ the opposite,\nwhich would be to grip\nthe bar or dumbbell,\net cetera, very tightly.\nAnd you want to contract\nyour core or even fill\nyour body with air as a, say,\nplug all the leaks, et cetera.\nSo this gets into kind\nof form and movement,\nwhich is an extensive\nnear infinite landscape\nof discussion, again, that we\ndon't have time to go into.\nI just want to mention those\ntwo nervous system related tips\nbecause I suppose as a\nneuroscientist, they appeal\nto me because they're\ngrounded in fundamental\nprinciples of how the nervous\nsystem innervates muscle.\nAnd I know that they will benefit\nyou the first time you\nuse them and every time.\nSpeaking of grip and\nnervous system and fitness\nand longevity, Dr. Peter\nAttia, who is a medical doctor,\nwas a guest on the Huberman\nLab podcast and provided\nan enormous wealth of information\non that podcast episode.\nI really encourage you to check\nit out when you have time.\nAnd of course has his\nown spectacular podcast,\nThe Drive with Peter Attia.\nPeter, Dr. Attia, I should say,\noften talks about certain\nmovements or exercises\nthat you should perform not\njust to improve your fitness,\nbut also to touch into or\nmeasure how fit you are\nand how well you are\nprogressing toward a long\nlifespan and healthspan.\nAnd one of those includes\nthe ability to hang\nfrom a bar for a minute or longer.\nAnd there are a number\nof different expectations\nthat one can have of how\nlong they should be able\nto hang from a bar depending on their age\nand their fitness level, et cetera.\nPlease check out Dr. Attia's podcast\nand his various social\nmedia sites to get more\ninformation on that.\nBut what I can tell you is\nthat if you're going to hang\nfrom a bar and you want to\nhang from that bar as long\nas possible, which turns\nout to be a interesting\nand important metric of your health,\nthen gripping the bar very\ntightly will actually help.\nEarlier we talked about\nwhether or not to train\nif you're sleep deprived\nand how to recover\nfrom what I would say is\nmoderate sleep deprivation\nby doing NSDR as opposed\nto total sleep deprivation\nlike being up all night or having a truly\nmiserable night, which case,\nI think you should just\nskip training the next day\nand slide it forward.\nNow, a similar issue\ncomes up from time to time\nwhere people wonder whether\nor not they should train\nor not if they're sick.\nAnd here there's all\nsorts of crazy gym lore\nand sport specific lore.\nFor instance, I used to hear this,\nwhen I ran cross country,\nthere was this adage\nthat if the symptoms were\nfrom the neck up, you could still train.\nThat is if you were really\ncongested and you had\na headache, you could still run.\nWhereas if it was in your\nchest and in your lungs\nyou couldn't run.\nI don't think there's any data whatsoever\nto support whether or not that's true\nor whether it's not true.\nFor myself, and because\nmy general goal is to be\ntraining and fit over time,\nbut also to include general\nhealth in the fitness equation,\nthat is to not be sick or chronically sick\nand certainly not to\nget other people sick.\nIf I have a little tiny sniffle,\nlike I think I might be\ngetting sick, even then,\nI'm a little cautious in\nthe sense that I'm not going\nto do my typical workout.\nI might stop at about 15 minutes earlier.\nAnd I would do that not by\nneglecting any body parts\nor anything of that sort.\nIf it's a weight training workout,\nby simply reducing the\ntotal number of sets,\nI probably wouldn't do any\nsets to failure, if I did,\nI might reduce the total\nnumber or percentage of sets\nto failure from about 30%\nof sets to maybe closer\nto 10% of sets, something like that.\nAnd if it was endurance work,\nI might throttle back by 10 or 20%.\nAnd I will shorten the total\nduration of the workout.\nAnd I often find that\nbecause of the known, yes,\npeer reviewed known immune\nsystem enhancing effects\nof exercise, sometimes\nthat alone will allow me\nto avoid getting sick.\nBut of course I'm also\ncareful to get home,\ntake a hot shower, not stress myself out,\nif I can avoid getting\nmyself stressed out and focus\non sleep, NSDR, other forms of recovery,\ngood nutrition, et cetera.\nIf however, I have a real sniffle, a cold,\nI'm not feeling well or\nI think I might be coming\ndown with a flu,\nI absolutely do not train\nand I don't get back\ninto training of any kind\nuntil I'm completely recovered.\nSo what I'm basically saying is that, no,\nI don't believe you should\ntrain if you're sick.\nAnd perhaps equally importantly,\nwhen you come back from\na layoff of any kind,\nwhether or not because of\nillness or for whatever reason,\nI do believe that because\nyour body is a bit untrained,\nit's not ideal to jump\nright back into maximal\ntraining and to take one,\nmaybe two weeks of ramping\nup to the full duration\nand intensity of workouts\nthat then I would continue on\ngoing for however many\ncycles I can complete\nbefore I hit another\nsickness or I hit another gap\nin my schedule due to family obligations\nor other obligations, et cetera.\nSo we've covered a lot\nof tools and protocols\nand variables related to fitness,\nbut we have by no means\ncovered all the available\ntools and protocols and variables.\nBefore we wrap up, I do\nwant to emphasize one tool.\nIt's a very easy, in fact, zero cost,\nvery low time commitment tool.\nAnd this was one that was provided, again,\nby Dr. Andy Galpin when he was\non the Huberman Lab podcast.\nAnd it's a tool that there\nis excellent research\nto support the effectiveness of,\nand that I do believe\nshould come at the end\nof every training session.\nAnd that's to do three to five minutes\nof deliberately slowed breathing.\nIt sounds so simple,\nthree to five minutes of\ndeliberately slowed breathing.\nSo this could be while\nyou're in the shower\nor when you arrive at your car,\nyou might sit in your car quietly and do\nthat if you have time or maybe\neven while you're driving back to,\nor onto your next destination,\njust to really slow down your breathing,\nto really look at the\nrecovery period that has\nto follow each training session.\nAnd of course, during\nwhich the adaptations,\nthe changes that make you\nmore fit than you were\ngoing into the exercise occur.\nAnd that three to five\nminutes of deliberately\nslowed breathing has been\nshown in Andy's group\nand in related experiments,\nnot exactly the same,\nbut related experiments\nin our laboratory, in other laboratories,\nto really so-called\ndownshift the nervous system\nand really set you up for\nmaximal recovery, rapid recovery,\nand allow you to lean into\nthe next training session\nwith full intensity\nwhen that training session\neventually arrives.\nSo it's a very simple tool,\nbut a very potent tool\nfor your overall fitness.\nSo thank you for joining\nme for this discussion\nof what I'm calling a\nfoundational, or yes,\nwe could even get bold and call\nit an optimal fitness protocol.\nAlthough the word optimal is a tricky one.\nThere's no real optimal fitness protocol.\nAnd today what I've\nreally tried to focus on\nis this foundational protocol\nbecause it does allow\nyou to check off most,\nif not all the boxes related\nto strength, endurance,\nhypertrophy, speed, power, flexibility.\nIt will also teach you how\nto regulate your nervous\nsystem up and down.\nThat is to ramp up and focus,\nmind muscle link, et cetera,\nand then quickly calm\ndown, physiological sighs,\nthree to five minute decompress breathing\nat the end of training, et cetera.\nReally, even though I\ntalked about the protocol\nthat I follow, and again,\nthat we will provide as a\nnewsletter at hubermanlab.com\nif you want to look at it in more detail,\neven though we talked about it\nin the context of what I do,\nagain, I really want to\nemphasize that this protocol\nand the description of\nthis protocol and all\nits variables is really for\nyou and for you to tailor\nto your specific needs.\nSo please, take the\nprotocol into consideration,\nbut do not treat it as holy,\ntreat it as a starting point\nfrom which you can adapt it\nto your specific fitness needs.\nIf you're learning from and or enjoying\nthe Huberman Lab podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube
