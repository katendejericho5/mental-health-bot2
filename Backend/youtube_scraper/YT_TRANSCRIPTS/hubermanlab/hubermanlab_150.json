    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Nolan Williams.\nDr. Williams is a medical doctor\nand professor of psychiatry\nand behavioral sciences\nat Stanford University School of Medicine.\nHis laboratory and clinic\nfocus on depression\nand other mood disorders.\nThey focus specifically on the use\nof transcranial magnetic stimulation,\nwhich is a brain stimulation technique\nthat can either activate or\nquiet specific brain circuits,\nas well as circuits within the body,\nin order to treat depression\nand other mood disorders.\nOther laboratories and clinics use TMS.\nWhat sets apart the work of\nNolan Williams and colleagues is\nthat they combine TMS\nwith other treatments,\nand some of those treatments\nare among the more cutting edge\nthat you've probably\nheard about these days,\nincluding ibogaine, psilocybin,\nMDMA, cannabis, DMT,\nand other drugs that at this\npoint in time are experimental\nin terms of clinical trials,\nbut that at least the\npreliminary data show\nhold great promise for the\ntreatment of depression\nand other mood disorders.\nIn the course of my\ndiscussion with Dr. Williams,\nwe covered things such as the history\nof each of these drugs,\nhow they came to be,\nand their current status in\nterms of their clinical use\nand legality.\nWe also talk about their safety profiles\nboth in children and in adults,\nand we talk about what the\nfuture of psychedelic research\nand clinical use really looks like.\nFor instance, we discuss\nhow a number of laboratories\nand clinics are modifying psychedelics\nto remove some of their\nhallucinogenic properties\nwhile maintaining some\nof their antidepressant\nor anti trauma properties.\nYou'll also learn about\nsome fascinating research\nin Dr. Williams' laboratory\nfocused on ketamine,\nwhich is a drug that is\nincreasingly being used\nto treat depression.\nAnd contrary to common belief,\nthe effects of ketamine in\nterms of relieving depression\nmay not actually arise from\nits dissociative effects.\nOne thing that you'll find extraordinary\nabout Dr. Williams is\nthat not only does he have\nvast knowledge of the various\ntreatments for depression,\nbut that he and his laboratory\nare really combining\nthese treatments in the most potent way.\nThat is, combining psychedelic treatments\nwith brain-machine interface,\nor combining brain-machine interface\nwith particular learning protocols.\nThat is, neuroplasticity protocols,\nwhich can directly change\nthe brain in specific ways.\nSo today you're going to\nlearn a tremendous amount\nabout the neural circuitry\nunderlying depression,\nas well as positive moods.\nYou'll also learn about\nall the various drugs\nthat I described,\nand you're really going to\nlearn about the current status\nand future of the treatment\nof mood disorders.\nToday, you'll also learn about\na number of ongoing studies\nin Dr. Williams' laboratory.\nI should mention that they\nare recruiting subjects\nfor these studies.\nIf you go to BSL,\nwhich stands for Brain\nStimulation Laboratory,\nso that's bsl.stanford.edu,\nyou have the opportunity to apply\nfor one of these clinical trials\nfor the treatment of depression\nand other mood disorders.\nI confess that the conversation\nwith Dr. Williams was,\nfor me, one of the more stimulating\nand informative\nconversations I've ever had\nabout psychedelics,\nwhich is simply to say that his breadth\nand depth of knowledge on\nthat topic is incredible,\nand his breadth and depth of knowledge\nin terms of the underlying brain science\nand how it can all be combined\nwith clinical applications\nis also extraordinary.\nI'm sure that by the\nend of today's episode,\nyou're going to come away\nwith a tremendous amount of\nknowledge about the clinical\nand non-clinical uses of those substances,\nand you're going to understand a lot more\nabout how the healthy\nand diseased brain work.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat the Huberman Lab\nPodcast has now launched\na premium channel.\nI want to be very clear\nthat the Huberman Lab\nPodcast will continue\nto be released every Monday\nat zero cost to consumer\nand there will be no change in\nthe format of these podcasts.\nThe premium channel is a response\nto the many questions we\nget about specific topics,\nand it will allow me to really drill deep\ninto specific answers\nrelated to those topics.\nSo once a month,\nI'm going to host an ask\nme anything, so called AMA,\nwhere you can ask me anything\nabout specific topics covered\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nand I will answer those questions.\nThose of course will be recorded.\nThere will also be other\npremium content available\nto premium subscribers,\nsuch as transcripts and\nshort videos of new tools\nand unique tools for mental\nhealth, physical health,\nand performance.\nIf you want to check\nout the premium channel,\nyou can go to hubermanlab.com/premium.\nThere is a $10 a month\ncharge or $100 per year,\nand I should mention that a\nlarge portion of the proceeds\nfrom the Huberman Lab\npremium channel will go\nto support scientific research\nthat develops the very sorts of tools\nthat we talk about on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nThe rest of the support\nfor the Huberman Lab Podcast\npremium channel will go\nto supporting the regular\nHuberman Lab Podcast.\nAgain, that's hubermanlab.com/premium.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed with\na quality blood test.\nOne problem with a lot of DNA tests\nand blood tests, however,\nis you get data back about\nlevels of metabolic factors,\nlevels of hormones, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker makes interpreting your data\nand knowing what to do\nabout it exceedingly easy.\nThey have a personalized\nplatform where you can go\nand you can see those levels\nof hormones, metabolic factors,\nlipids, et cetera,\nand they point to specific\nnutritional tools,\nbehavioral tools, supplement\nbased tools, et cetera,\nthat can help you bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto

covers\nwith cooling, heating, and\nsleep tracking capacity.\nI started sleeping on an\nEight Sleep mattress cover\na few months ago, and\nit is simply incredible.\nIn fact, I don't even\nlike traveling anymore\nbecause they don't have\nEight Sleep mattress covers\nin hotels and Airbnbs.\nOne of the reasons\nI love my Eight Sleep mattress\ncover so much is that,\nas you may have heard before\non this podcast or elsewhere,\nin order to fall and stay deeply asleep,\nyou need your body temperature to drop\nby about one to three degrees.\nAnd I tend to run warm at night,\nwhich makes it hard to sleep\nand sometimes wakes me up\nin the middle of the night.\nWhen you sleep on an Eight\nSleep mattress cover,\nyou can program the temperature\nof that mattress cover\nfor specific times in the early, middle,\nand late part of your night so\nthat the mattress stays cool.\nAnd as a consequence, you\nsleep very, very deeply.\nIt also tracks your sleep,\nso it's paying attention to\nhow many times you're moving,\nhow deep your sleep is.\nIt gives you a sleep score,\nall wonderful data to help\nyou enhance your sleep.\nAnd of course, sleep is the\nfoundation of mental health,\nphysical health, and performance,\nwhich makes an Eight Sleep a terrific tool\nfor enhancing not just your sleep,\nbut all aspects of your life really.\nIf you're interested in trying\na Eight Sleep mattress cover,\nyou can go to EightSleep.com/Huberman\nto check out the Pod 3 cover,\nand you can save $150 at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships\nto the USA, to Canada, the UK,\nand select countries in\nthe EU and Australia.\nAgain, that's EightSleep.com/Huberman\nto save $150 at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all American swimmers\nfrom Stanford, and everything\nabout ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that your\nvisual system has to contend\nwith some pretty significant challenges\nin order to be able to see clearly\nas you move from one area to the next.\nFor instance,\nwhen you go from a shady\narea to a bright area.\nROKA understands this and\nhave designed their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses accordingly\nso you always see with crystal clarity.\nIn addition,\nbecause they were initially\ndesigned for performance,\nthings like running and biking,\nthey're extremely lightweight,\nbut they have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo unlike a lot of\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat were designed for sports\nand make you look like a cyborg,\nthey have styles that make\nyou look like a cyborg\nif you like those, but\nthey also have styles\nthat you'd be perfectly\ncomfortable wearing to work\nor out to dinner, et cetera.\nThey're really terrific glasses.\nI love mine because I\ncan wear them anywhere\nand I also use them when\nrunning and going out hiking,\net cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's ROKA.com,\nand enter the code

supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nThings like enhancing sleep\nand the depth of sleep,\nor for enhancing focus\nand cognitive ability,\nor for enhancing energy or\nadjusting hormone levels\nto optimal range for you.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast is now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nTo find the supplements we discussed\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nyou can go to livemomentous,\nspelled O-U-S,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd I should just mention that the library\nof those supplements is\nconstantly expanding.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Nolan Williams.\nThanks for joining today.\nI'm really excited to\nhave this conversation.\nIt's been a long time coming\nand I have a lot of questions\nabout different compounds,\npsychedelics in particular.\n- Yeah.\n- But before we get into that discussion,\nI want to ask you about\ndepression, broadly speaking.\nIntractable depression.\nHow common depression is or isn't.\nI heard you say in a\nwonderful talk that you gave,\nthat depression is\nperhaps the most debilitating\ncondition worldwide.\nAnd yet,\nin contrast to other medical\nconditions like cancer,\nwe actually have a fairly\nlimited number of tools\nto approach depression.\nAnd yet number of tools\nand the potency of those tools is growing.\nSo if you could educate us on depression,\nI would really appreciate it.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\nSo depression is a condition that,\nit has a lot of manifestations, you know.\nSo you can have kind of a depression\nthat's primarily loss of interest.\nYou can have folks who feel very anxious\nand they're kind of overactive.\nYou can have people who don't\nhave any anxiety at all,\nand they're very underactive\nand they have low\nmotivation to do anything.\nYou know, so you have this\nhuge range of symptoms\nthat are in that umbrella of depression.\nAnd some of our work is to actually work\nwith folks like Conor Liston and Cornell,\nand try to actually get biotypes\nbased off of neuroimaging\nto see if we can kind of parse\nout the different depression\nkind of presentations,\nand see that clinically,\nand also see that in the brain.\nDepression is the most\ndisabling condition worldwide.\nWhat's interesting about depression is\nit's both a risk factor\nfor other illnesses,\nand it makes other medical and\npsychiatric illnesses worse,\nright?\nSo recently the American Heart\nAssociation added depression\nas the fourth major risk factor\nfor coronary artery disease, right?\nSo alongside the risk\nfactors that we know,\nhypertension, high blood\npressure, hyperlipidemia,\nhigh cholesterol, and diabetes,\nyou know, high blood sugar,\nthose three have been on\nthe list for a long time\nand depression ended up\nbeing added to the list\nas the fourth one.\nAnd you know, really interesting, right?\nSo in addition to taking medications\nto address those other three risk factors,\nwe really have to be thinking\nabout how do you treat\nfolks with depression\nto reduce the risk of having\na heart attack in the future?\nAnd, you know, there's some\nof that's being worked on now,\nbut we don't have a complete solution\nto thinking about that at this time.\nAnd then the other thing\nthat's interesting is\nonce you have a heart attack,\nin the individuals that end\nup having a heart attack,\nthe risk of having depression\nafter the heart attack is\nhigher than the normal population, right?\nAnd so a lot of what we're\ndoing in the lab actually is\nmeasuring kind of brain heart connections.\nAnd we can actually, with\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation,\na form of brain stimulation,\nwe can actually decelerate the heart rate\nand capture that heart rate deceleration\nover the mood regulatory regions.\nAnd so actually a direct\nprobe of that connection.\nSo it's interesting.\nAnd so, you know, as you\nsaid a second ago, you know,\nit's a very disabling condition.\nModerate depression's about as disabling\nas having a heart attack,\nacutely having a heart attack.\nSevere depression is disabling,\nis having cancer without\ntreatment, you know,\nand dying from a cancer without treatment.\nAnd so, you know, it's\nkind of underappreciated\njust how disabling\ndepression is in that way.\nAnd I think important\nas stigma is consistently\nkind of being reduced\nover the years for mental illnesses,\nthen the idea that we can start\nreally putting more funding\nand putting more focus at\nthe federal level, you know,\nprivate foundation level, whatever it is,\nat a given university\nto thinking about developing treatments.\nWe've been very interested\nin a very particular\nclinical set of problems\naround the most severe and\nthe most high acuity settings\nthat folks with depression\nend up being in.\nAnd that's in, you\nknow, emergency settings\nwhere they go into inpatient units.\nAnd you know, in the rest of medicine,\nif it's talking about heart attacks,\nif I start having chest pain right now\nand you bring me to a\nprimary care doctor's office,\nthey're going to have a\ncertain number of tests\nand treatments, right?\nBut very limited cuz it's\nan outpatient facility.\nIf you bring me to the\nemergency room after that,\nthere are more tests and more treatments.\nIf you put me in the\nICU or in the cath lab\nwhere they do invasive\nprocedures to the heart,\nthere are more tests and more treatments.\nIn psychiatry, as we elevate\nthe acuity of an individual,\nyou go from being just\ndepressed to being depressed\nand now thinking about ending your life,\nthe number of treatments\nactually go down on average.\nI mean, in some scenarios, they go up,\nbut on average they go down\nand there are no tests, right?\nAnd so we've been very focused\non that particular problem.\nSomebody that maybe was doing, you know,\nfairly okay with a pretty\nmoderate depression\nand then their depression gets worse\nand then they end up in\nan emergency setting.\nAnd the field really\nhasn't developed a way\nof consistently being\nable to treat that problem\nand folks end up getting\nthe same standard oral antidepressants\nthat they've been getting outpatient.\nAnd I came to this because\nI, you know, dual trained\nas a neurologist and psychiatrist,\nwent back and forth between\nneurology and psychiatry,\nsaw that in neurology we\nhave all of these ways\nof treating acute brain based problems\nand really wanted to\nemulate that in psychiatry\nand find ways to develop\nand engineer new, you know,\nbrain based solutions.\n- There's a lot to unpack there.\nOne thing that you said is,\nI'd like to focus on a bit\nmore because I think we hear\nthat the brain and the\nheart are connected,\nbut you described, I believe,\na direct relationship\nbetween areas of the brain\nassociated with emotion\nand heart rate.\n- [Nolan] Yes.\n- And that makes perfect\nlogical sense to me.\nBut I think at the same time,\nmany people out there probably\nthink of the relationship\nbetween the heart and\nthe mind as kind of woo\nor kind of a soft biology.\nBut here you're talking about\nan actual physical connection.\n- [Nolan] Yep.\n- Between, what area of the brain is it?\n- The first place where the\nstimulation goes is called\nthe dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nIt's kind of the sense of control,\nkind of governor of the brain.\nAnd then what we know is\nthat when you use a magnet,\nuse kind of what we call Faraday's Law,\nthis idea of using a magnetic pulse\nto induce an electrical current\nand electrically conducting substances.\nSo in this case, brain tissue,\nbut not skull or scalp\nor any of that, or hair.\nYou avoid all that, just the brain tissue.\nThen you have a direct\ndepolarization of cortical neurons,\nyou know, the surface\nof the brain's neurons,\nin this dorsolateral prefrontal.\nAnd if you do that in the\nactual scanner, which we can do,\nyou can see that that distributes down\ninto the anterior cingulate and\nthe insula and the amygdala.\nAnd ultimately the tract\ngoes into something called\nthe nucleus tractus solitarius\nand ultimately into the\nvagus nerve into the heart.\nSo the heart very consistently\nseems to be the end organ\nof the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nIf you measure heart rate in standard ways\nthat cardiologists measure heart rate\nand you stimulate over\nthis left dorsolateral,\nyou get a deceleration of the heart rate\nand it's very time locked\nto the stimulation.\nSo it's a two second train of stimulation.\nAt one second, you see the deceleration,\nit goes down about 10 beats per minute,\nand then it'll drift back\nup and there's a break\nfor eight seconds on the stimulation.\nDrifts back up and the\nstimulation goes back in\nand then the heart rate goes back down.\nAnd so you see the\nheart rate just do this,\n10 beats per minute every train.\nAnd so we know, and if you\ndo that over visual cortex,\nyou don't get that,\nor motor cortex, you don't\nget any of those findings.\nIt's really specific to\nthis kind of control region\nof the brain.\nAnd so, yeah, it seems to, you know,\nit's our work, other folks' work.\nMartin Arens in Europe, the Netherlands,\nwork showing the same connections.\nI think it's been replicated\nlike four or five times.\n- So you mentioned left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nAnytime I hear about\nlateralization of function,\nI get particularly curious\nbecause obviously we have\ntwo mirror symmetric sides\nof the brain.\nThere are, you know,\nrare exceptions to this,\nlike the pineal and things of that sort\nthat there is only one pineal.\nWhat is special\nabout the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex?\nDoes this have anything\nto do with handedness,\nright hand or left hand?\nBecause we know right-hand\nand left-handedness has a lot\nto do with lateralization\nof function for language,\na topic for another time.\nBut why do you think\nthat left dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex would be connected\nto the heart in this way?\n- Yeah.\nYeah, I think, so left\ndorsolateral is thought\nto be the side that when you excite it,\nwhen you kind of do\nexcitatory stimulation,\npotentiating sort of stimulation,\nthat you can reduce depressive symptoms.\nAnd a guy by the name of Mike\nFox at Harvard demonstrated\nthat if you have strokes in\nthe brain that cause depression\nand you put them on the human connectome,\na hundred, you know, thousand patient map,\nand you ask the question\nwhat they're all\nfunctionally connected to?\nLeft dorsolateral.\nIf you take lesions that\ncause mania in individuals\nand you put those all on\nthe human connectome map\nand ask what the one common\narea they're all connected to,\nit's the right dorsolateral.\nAnd so there seems to be\na hemispheric, you know,\nbalancing of mood between\nthese two brain regions.\nAnd we know this from an\nexperimental standpoint too,\nbecause you can take\nindividuals with depression\nand you can excite the left\nor you can inhibit the right\nand they're both antidepressant.\nYou can excite the right\nand that's anti-manic in some studies.\nAnd so this idea that there\nis this hemispheric balancing\nof mood is quite interesting, right?\n- It's incredibly interesting.\nAnd just so people know,\nif you're curious what the connectome is,\nconnectome is a term that\nwas built out of this notion\nof genomes being large collections\nof sequencing and mapping of genes.\nThey're proteomes of proteins,\nof connectomes is so-called connectomics,\nof connections between neurons.\nSo the Human Connectome Project is ongoing\nand I find that incredible\nthat within the Connectome Project,\nthey can identify these regularities\nof right versus left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex.\nEspecially since I've looked\nat a fair number of brains\nfrom humans, certainly\nnot as many as you have.\nAnd if you look at the\narchitecture, the layers,\nthe cell types, and\neven the neurochemicals\nof which cells are expressing,\nsay, dopamine or serotonin\nor receiving input from areas\nthat make dopamine or serotonin,\nthey don't look that different\non the right and left side.\nAnd yet here we're talking\nabout a kind of an accelerator\nand a brake, if you will,\non depression and mania\nusing what, at least by my eye\nand I think other people's\neye look to be basically\nthe same set of of bits.\nThe same parts list, more or less.\nSo what gives these properties\nto the right and left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex?\nIs it the inputs they receive?\nIs this something that we\nlearn during development\nor do you think that\nwe come into the world\nwith these hemispheric biases?\n- Yeah, it's a great question.\nAnd you know, it hasn't been worked out,\nwhich your original question was around,\nin a left handed individual,\nwhich as you know,\n25% of those folks end up\nhaving a right brain dominance\nor 1% of right-handed people\nhave a right brain dominance\nif it's flipped, right?\nAnd unfortunately that\nstudy still hasn't been done\nat the level, 'cause that would\nbe probably pretty helpful\nfor teasing some of this out.\nBut, you know, it's still\nbeing sorted out, right?\nWe know enough to know\nthis phenomenon exists\nbecause we can use TMS as a probe\nand do these sorts of manipulations.\nBut to my knowledge,\nthere hasn't been anybody that's\ngotten so interested in it\nthat they've been able to get\na mechanism of why that is.\nBut, you know, it's\nkind of empirically true\nin the sense that you can push\nand pull on those systems,\nor in the case of strokes that folks have,\nand then you kind of get their\nbrains and their brain images\nand look at where the strokes landed,\nthose kind of causal\nbits of information point\nto this asymmetry.\n- Interesting.\nWell, in that case, going\nwith what we do know,\nthat stimulation of\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nslows the heart rate down,\ntransiently, but it slows it down,\nand seems to alleviate at least\nsome symptoms of depression,\nleads me to the question of\nwhy would that be the case?\nDoes it tell us anything\nfundamental about depression\nthat anxiety is inherent to depression?\nI think a faster heart rate is, you know,\npart and parcel with anxiety.\nIn my laboratory, we've studied fear a bit\nin animals and in humans,\nand we often observe bradycardia\nwhere somebody or an animal\nis afraid of something\nand rather than the\nheart rate speeding up,\nit actually slows down,\nsomething that most people\ndon't think about or recognize.\nBut given that stimulation\nof dorsolateral prefrontal\ncortex slows the heart rate down\nand can alleviate depressive symptoms\nand that there are other\nways to slow the heart down,\nI have two questions.\nWhat do you think this tells us\nabout the basic architecture of depression\nand its physiology at\nthe level of the heart?\nAnd does the circuit run in\nthe opposite direction too?\nIf one were to have or find other ways\nto slow the heart rate down,\nsay with a beta blocker,\ndoes that help alleviate depression?\n- Yeah, no, that's a great question.\nSo I'll answer the second question first.\nSo we know that in the\nongoing trials of this,\nif you stimulate in the vagus nerve,\nin an implanted vagus nerve stimulator,\nyou can actually, you know, have this,\nthe afferent parts of the\nvagus project ultimately up\nto the DLPFC through the cingulate\nthrough these anterior\ninsula, so that same,\nthat obviously the same tract, right?\nAnd you can stimulate there\nand alleviate depression,\nwhich seems very unusual, right?\nYou're stimulating a cranial\nnerve down on the neck.\nBut if you can get up into the brain,\nyou actually can improve\ndepressive symptoms.\nAnd so, you know, more evidence\nthat this is a kind of a\nwhole track and system.\nAnd if you stimulate\nin part of that system,\nit appears that you can improve mood.\n- And what if I were somebody\nwho did not have a stimulating\nelectrode in my vagus nerve\nand I was dealing with minor depression\nand I decided I wanted to\ntake some other approach\nto slow my heart rate down by the vagus?\nFor instance, exhale emphasized breathing\nor deliberately slow cadence\nbreathing, things of that sort.\nIs there any evidence that\nbehavioral interventions\nof those kinds can alleviate depression\nor some symptoms of depression?\nAnd is there any evidence\nthat it does indeed feed back\nto the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nto achieve some of that alleviation?\n- Absolutely, yeah.\nSo there's a number of studies\nimplicating the dorsolateral\nin, say, you know, meditation,\nmindfulness, that sort of thing.\nAnd they're small studies,\nbut pretty well designed\nstudies suggesting\nthat behavioral interventions\nin mild depression\nactually work quite well.\nThere seems to be a volitional\nthreshold for depression\nwhere at some point you start losing,\nyou go from being\ncompletely in total volition\nto having kind of semi-volition.\nYou have thoughts\nthat you really have a\nhard time controlling\nand that sort of thing.\nAnd when you go through that threshold,\nat some point it gets harder and harder\nfor those sorts of things\nto kind of kick in and work.\nAnd the extreme form of\nthat is catatonia, right?\nWhere people in a very\nsevere form of depression get\nkind of stuck motorically, right?\nAnd they obviously can't,\nthey have no control\nor very limited control.\nAnd so, you know, I\nthink there's a threshold\nin which these sorts of\ninterventions will work.\nExercise seems to really\nbe a good treatment\nfor mild depression and it may work\nthrough the mechanism\nyou're describing, right?\nAs we all know, you know,\nathletes hold a lower resting heart rate\nthan folks that aren't, you\nknow, if you were an athlete,\nyou had a lower resting heart\nrate, you stopped exercising,\nand a couple years later\nyour resting heart rate\nin many cases goes up, right?\nAnd so maybe that's part of the process.\nI'm not aware of any\nstudies specifically looking\nat dorsolateral prefrontal physiology\npre-post exercise, but it\nwould be a great study.\nI think that would be really\nhelpful to understanding this,\nespecially if you had a\ncorrelation of changes\nin kind of lowering of, say,\nheart rate with mood improvements.\nThere's been a lot of work\nwith heart rate variability\nand depression and, you know,\nstudies kind of point towards it.\nNot every study is positive for this,\nbut quite a few studies say basically\nthat lower heart rate\nvariability is associated\nwith, you know, moderate\nto severe depression.\nAnd that may be part of that mechanism\nof that heart brain risk.\n- So I'm both intrigued\nand a little bit perplexed\nby this relationship between\nheart rate and depression.\nOn the face of it, I would think\nof depression as depressed.\nSo lower heart rate might\nmake somebody more depressed.\nYou even mentioned catatonia\nor somebody that just\ndoesn't seem motivated\nor excited to do anything.\nI think of mania as elevated\nheart rate and being excited.\nOn the other hand, I realize that anxiety,\nwhich you know, brings about ideas\nas elevated heart rate is\nalso built into depression.\nWhich brings me back to\nwhat you said earlier,\nwhich is that when we say depression,\nare we really talking about\nfour or five different?\n- Yeah, that's right.\n- Disorders, for lack of a better word.\nAnd for what percentage of\npeople that have depression\ndoes some approach to\nreducing heart rate work?\nWhether or not it's stimulation\nof the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nby way of transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation\nor by taking a beta blocker\nor by stimulating the vagus.\nCan we throw out a number, a rough number?\nDoes that help, 30%, 50%?\nHow long lasting is that relief?\n- Yeah, and to be clear,\nthe deceleration of the heart rate is\nin the moment when the\nstimulation is happening,\nbut it's not something\nthat's necessarily maintained chronically.\nIt's more of an indicator that\nyou're in the right network\nmore than it appears\nto be itself, you know,\ncentral to the mechanism.\nThe heart rate variability piece may be,\nand there's some studies\nthat link the two,\nbut the actual deceleration\nseems to be much more\nof a marker that you're\nin the right system.\nBut you know, it very well could be\nthat the heart rate system\nand the mood system just\nsit next to each other\nand the stimulation hits both.\nIf you look at how much of\nthe variance in the mood is\nexplained by the heart rate deceleration,\nit's not a huge amount, right?\nSo it only explains a small percentage.\nAnd so it's unlikely that\nsimply reducing the heart rate.\nAnd in fact, you know, for many years,\npropranolol and these sorts of drugs\nactually were implicating\ncausing depression.\nAnd so that's been kind of\ndebunked, but it's unlikely\nthat simply decelerating\nthe heart rate's going to\nimprove depression.\nBut what it does tell you is\nthat if you're in that area\nthat is the mood regulatory area,\nthere's some parasympathetic\ncortical kind of process\nthat's going on that gets in\nand causes this to happen.\nAnd it's, you know, it's\nindependent of mood.\nYou can take a normal healthy\nindividual and you can do this\nand they're going to\ndecelerate their heart rate.\n- I'm so glad you mentioned\nthe parasympathetic nervous system,\nwhich of course is the,\nmost people think of\nas the rest and digest\nor the kind of calming side of\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nAs I'm hearing you say all of this,\nand in particular what you just told me,\nwhich is that it's not\nas if having a lower\nheart rate protects you\nagainst depression\nor a higher heart rate is\nassociated with depression,\nalthough at the extremes\nthat might be true,\nbut rather it's something\nabout the regulatory network,\nthe ability to control\nyour own nervous system\nto some extent.\nAnd when I think about the\nautonomic nervous system,\nI like to think about it as a seesaw\nof, you know, alertness and calmness,\nand when you're asleep\nit's a lot of calmness,\nand when you're panicking it's\na lot of alertness to the...\nBut that, and I don't think\nthis has ever been defined,\nand when I teach the medical students\nat Stanford neuroanatomy, my wish is\nthat someday I'll be able\nto explain what the hinge\nin that process would be, right?\nNot the ends of the seesaw.\nWe know what the sympathetic\nnervous system is\nand it's to wake us up and make us panic\nor make us feel nicely alert and calm.\nWe know what puts someone\ninto sleep or a coma\nor makes them feel relaxed.\nBut what shifts from one side\nof the seesaw to the other\nand the tightness of\nthat hinge seems to be\nwhat you're describing,\nthat depression is sort\nof a lack of control\nover inner state so\nthat when I'm stressed,\nI can't get myself out of it.\nBut when I'm feeling completely\ncollapsed with exhaustion,\nI can't get out of bed and be motivated\nto do the very things\nthat would help me get out of depression,\nlike a workout or social\nconnection or eat a quality meal,\nthese kinds of things.\nSo this is perhaps the first time\nthat I've ever heard\nabout a potential circuit\nfor the hinge, as I'm referring to it.\nDoes that make any sense at all?\n- [Nolan] Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.\n- Okay, I just want to make sure\nthat I'm framing this\ncorrectly in my mind.\n- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\nAnd in some studies,\nif you do the same identical stimulation\non the right dorsolateral,\nyou can get an acceleration.\nYou know, just kind of\nfurther confirming this idea\nof lateralization, right?\nThat it appears that even the\nprefrontal cortex, you know,\ncortical areas seem to be\nlateralized in this way.\nAnd, you know, it's less,\nthe right finding is more variable\ndepending upon the study.\nThe left's very consistent in this way.\nSo...\n- So we've talked about\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation\nfor getting into these networks\nand I also just want to take\na brief tangent and say,\n'cause I've heard you say this before,\nI think it's so vital what you're saying,\nthat it's really not\nabout stimulation of areas\nor any specific brain area\nor vagus nerve being important per se.\nIt's really about a network, a connection,\na series of connections.\nI think that's really important\nfor people to understand\nand is kind of a new\nemerging theme really.\nThe other thing that to me\nseems extremely important\nfor us to consider is\nwhat are these lateral\nprefrontal cortices doing?\nAre they involved, for\ninstance, in sensation,\nsensing the heart rate?\nAre they involved in\nthinking and planning?\nAnd this gets down to\na very simple question\nthat I know a lot of\npeople have, which is,\ncan we talk ourselves out of depression?\nIf it's mild.\nCan we talk ourselves into a manic state\nor an excited state,\na positively excited state\nthat doesn't qualify as mania?\nYou know, other areas of the brain,\nI think of is responsible for perception\nor for motor control.\nBut here we are in this\nmysterious frontal cortex area,\nwhich people say executive\nfunction, planning, et cetera.\nAre we talking about thoughts?\nAre we talking about structured thoughts\nor are we talking about\ndreamlike thoughts?\nWhat in the world is going\non in the prefrontal cortex?\nAnd here I spend my career in neuroscience\nand I still can't really\nunderstand what it's doing\nand maybe it's doing 50 things.\n- Yeah, no, it's a great question.\nSo, you know, to...\nSo one of the studies\nthat we've been working on\nin addition to the depression\nwork is actually trying\nto change trait hypnotizability.\nSo David Spiegel and I\nhave been working on this\nand you know, he's found and\npublished this 10 years ago\nthat a different part of\nthe left dorsolateral is\nfunctionally connected with\nthe dorsal anterior cingulate\nwith a lot of functional\nconnectivity in high hypnotizables\nand not much in low hypnotizables.\nAnd that's kind of a different sub-region\nwithin this bigger brain region\nwe call left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex\nthan the part that seems to be important\nfor regulating mood.\nAnd so the left dorsolateral\nseems to have connections\nthat are location specific\nwithin the overall kind\nof named brain region\nthat connect to various\nparts of the cingulate\nand seem to regulate it.\nRight?\nAnd so if you knock out\nthe left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nand you have people do the\nStroop task, for instance,\nwhich is a task where you\nhave, it's a simple task,\nyou probably know this.\nYou have people name the color of words.\nAnd so if I look at one of the\ncards that they'll show you,\nit'll have the word red in red\nand that's very easy and\nthat's called a congruent.\nAnd then the incongruent\nis red in the color blue\nand you have to name,\nyou have to say the word,\nyou don't name the color.\n- So you have to suppress a response.\n- Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nAnd so, I'm sorry, you name the color\nand you see the word\nwritten in a different way.\nAnd so basically if you stimulate in a way\nthat inhibits the left\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nor either one,\nyou can actually knock out\nthe ability to do that well\nand it'll take longer for\npeople on the incongruent cards\nto be able to name it.\nAnd so they have a kind of a time delay\nthat's greater than they had\nbefore they got stimulated.\nSo that's a part of the prefrontal cortex\nthat's different than the\npart of the prefrontal cortex\nthat's involved in mood regulation.\nThe nice thing about TMS\nis that you can go through\nand you can find these areas\nthat are functionally defined\nthrough brain imaging\nand you can perturb them\nand answer the question\nyou're talking about.\nHow do I understand this\npart of the prefrontal cortex\nand its function, this part?\nAnd so we were able to\nstimulate in an inhibitory way\nwithin the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex\nthat's involved with this sort\nof cognitive control area.\nAnd we were able to knock that area out\nand increase trait hypnotizability,\nso people had greater hypnotizability\nafter they got active stimulation\nversus when they got sham.\nAnd so it suggests that that\nbrain circuit is involved\nin the process of what therapeutic\nhypnosis ends up being.\nBut it's a very different region\nwithin the left dorsolateral than, say,\nwe do when we do these very\nintensive stimulation approaches\nto treat severe depression\nand we're able to get\npeople out of depression.\nYou know, with the part\nof the dorsolateral\nthat seems to be lower in the, you know,\nkind of more lateral and\ninferior on the DLPFC\nand connected with this\nsubgenual anterior cingulate,\nso the part of the anterior cingulate\nthat processes emotion.\n- I'd like to take a quick break\nand acknowledge one of our\nsponsors, Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens, now called AG1,\nis a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat covers all of your\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens once\nor usually twice a day is that\nit gets to me the probiotics\nthat I need for gut health.\nOur gut is very important.\nIt's populated by gut microbiota\nthat communicate with the\nbrain, the immune system,\nand basically all the\nbiological systems of our body\nto strongly impact our\nimmediate and long-term health.\nAnd those probiotics in\nAthletic Greens are optimal\nand vital for microbiotic health.\nIn addition, Athletic\nGreens contains a number\nof adaptogens, vitamins,\nand minerals that make sure\nthat all of my foundational\nnutritional needs are met\nand it tastes great.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to AthleticGreens.com/huberman\nand they'll give you\nfive free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nAgain, that's AthleticGreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\nBased on what you told\nus about the Stroop task\nand the role of the prefrontal\ncortex in the Stroop task,\nto me the Stroop task is\na rule switching game.\nYou're saying in one moment,\nthe rule is you read\nwhatever the word says\nand then you switch and then you say,\nthe rule now is you tell me\nwhat color the word is written in\nand you suppress whatever\nit is the word says, okay?\n- [Nolan] That's right.\n- Okay, a rule in some\nsense is, like that,\nis a transiently adopted belief system.\nSo I could imagine that in depression,\nwhich has all sorts of backstory to it,\nthat of course the\npsychiatrist or psychologist\nor friend can pull on that thread.\nLike for instance,\nsomebody might believe that they are bad\nor that they don't deserve love.\nI'm trying to bring this\ninto the typical language\nthat they would talk about.\nOr that they will never succeed.\nOr that even if they keep succeeding,\nit's just going to get harder and harder\nand it will never feel good.\nThese are sort of rules\nlike the Stroop task.\nAt some level.\nThere are rules that are\nmore pervasive over time,\nunfortunately.\nBut I could imagine that\nif the PFC is also contains\nsome sort of maps or algorithms\nrelated to rules of emotionality\nor self representation or\nthings that we've heard,\nI think there must be data out\nthere saying that, you know,\nwhatever we heard in middle school\nwhen someone made fun of\nus, we can remember that.\n'Cause I can remember\nthings that people said\nabout a jacket I wore one day\nor something in the fourth grade, crazy,\nI didn't even like the jacket.\nNow I think it was kind\nof cool, but anyway.\nThe point being that we\nhave an intense memory\nfor these things to set up a\nsort of rule or a question.\nLike maybe I don't really know\nhow to dress, for instance.\nMaybe that's why I always\nwear the same black shirt.\nBut in all seriousness,\nit seems like the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex is\nin this amazing position to\naccess rules which are beliefs\nand beliefs are rules,\nand then for moments or\nlonger, to switch those rules.\nAnd so for somebody who's depressed\nto just simply look\nthemselves in the mirror\nand say, \"You are great,\nyou are fantastic,\"\nit feels like a lie if you\nfeel like garbage to say that.\nIt doesn't fit with the rule.\nIt's like saying that card is not red,\nthat card is green, when your\neyes tell you that it's red.\nAnd it seems like there's\nsomething about prefrontal cortex\nthat in principle gives\nflexibility to rules\nbased on what we know\nabout the Stroop task.\nSo given its connectivity,\ncan we assume that the\ntalk therapy that occurs\nin the psychiatrist\noffice or with a friend\nor through journaling out something,\nbecause we do know that\nreporting things about trauma\nor difficult circumstances\nor the rules that we contain\nand tend to hide inside of us\nabout how we feel miserable\nabout ourselves or anything really,\nthat in rescripting that,\nthat somehow it allows us\nto do a sort of Stroop task\non our beliefs.\nIs that a tremendous leap?\nI'm just really trying to\nframe this in the context\nof what I and most people\nthink of as depression.\n- [Nolan] Yeah, totally.\n- Because the network components\nare vitally important,\nbut I guess what I'm\ntrying to figure out is\nlike what are the algorithms\nthat govern prefrontal cortex?\n- Yeah, absolutely.\nSo in a kind of standard\ncognitive behavioral\ntherapy session, right,\nwhat the therapist is trying\nto do is identify those beliefs\nand you know, kind of\ndetermine how fixed they are,\nyou know, if they're\nflexible as you're saying,\nand then help folks to find\nanother explanation for them\nand to kind of reintegrate that\npotential other explanation\ninto their memory system, right?\nWhere I think TMS is really\ninteresting, actually,\nwe had a lot of patients who've told me,\nlike my therapist told me that\nI wasn't trying hard enough\nin therapy, and you know,\nand I really am trying hard,\nbut these are, you know, moderate,\npretty severe depressed patients.\nAnd as soon as we get them\nwell with the TMS approaches,\nyou know, kind of rapid five day approach\nand the next week we come in and see them\nand they'll say,\n\"You know what I did all weekend is\nI looked at my therapy books\nand now I can understand it.\"\nAnd so, you know, I\nactually see TMS as a way\nof having kind of exogenous\nsorts of cognitive functions\nthat in milder forms of depression\nwe can pull off with psychotherapy.\nYou know, this idea of being able\nto kind of turn that prefrontal cortex on\nand have it govern these deeper regions.\nIn depression,\nthe deeper regions govern\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nThey precede the prefrontal\ncortex timing-wise.\nAnd we've got some data in review now\nwhere we're seeing that\nin depressed individuals\nthat are responsive to\nour rapid TMS approach,\nwhat we call\nStanford Accelerated Intelligent\nNeuromodulation Therapy,\nor SNT, or SAINT, if you look at the brain\nbefore people get this, they\nwill have a temporal delay\nwhere the cingulate is\nin front of the DLPFC.\nAnd in people that are\nnormal healthy controls,\nno depression, the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex is\ntemporally in front of\nthe anterior cingulate.\nWith effective treatment, we\ncan flip the timing of things\nso the dorsolateral is in front\nof the anterior cingulate,\njust like in a normal person.\n- So you're not talking\nabout obviously physically\nmoving these structures,\nyou're talking about in\ntime, their activation.\nSo in one case,\nit's like the coach telling\nthe player what to do.\nAnd the other is like a player\ntelling the coach what to do.\nAnd you restore order to the game.\n- You restore order to the game.\nAnd what it looks like is\ndepression, to your point,\nis a bunch of kind of spontaneous content\nthat's semi-volitional that's\nbeing kind of generated\nout of this conflict detection system.\nThe cingulate seems to sense conflict\nand kind of feed that information,\ngets overactive in depression.\nAnd then in depression, it\nlooks like the left dorsolateral\ndoes not sufficiently clamp down on it.\nAnd what therapy appears to\ndo is to kind of restore that.\nWhat we see with TMS over that region is\nthat we just exogenously\ndo the same sort of thing.\nWe restore the governance\nof the left dorsolateral\nover the cingulate area,\nand that is correlated\nwith treatment improvement.\nSo the degree in which you can re-time,\nre-regulate in time the left dorsolateral\nover the cingulate,\nthe more of an antidepressant\neffect you have.\n- Can we therefore say in crude terms\nthat the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex really is\nthe governor of how we\ninterpret physiological signals\nand spontaneous thoughts?\n- It places a lens\nthat the rest of the\nbrain sees things through.\nAnd you can do these experiments\nwhere you can put a normal\nhealthy control person\nin the scanner and you can make them feel\nlike they have a loss of control\nand then you can see that\nregion come offline, right?\nSo you can experimentally\nmanipulate the system,\nand so kind of buffing it up,\nit's like TMS is almost like\nexercise for the brain, right?\nYou're kind of exercising this\nregion over and over again\nwith a physiologically relevant signal\nand kind of turning that system on.\nAnd what's interesting,\nI think really interesting\nfor this show is to, you know,\nwe had a couple of folks, you know,\nprobably five or six folks that\nhave actually told me this,\nwhere if they remit\nearly enough in the week,\nwe have this very dense\nstimulation approach\nwhere we can stimulate\npeople really rapidly\nover a five day block.\nWe don't discriminate when they get better\nto when they stop.\nSo if they get better on day one,\nwe still give them the other four days\nbecause it's in the protocol to do that.\nAnd we can't, we're getting to a point\nwhere we can tell how\nlong it's going to take,\nbut we're not there yet.\nAnd so, you know,\nevery time somebody gets\nbetter at day one or two,\nat the beginning when we first\nstarted doing this, we'd say,\nyou know, we're not sure, you know,\nwe think this is safe to keep going,\nbut you know, what do you want to do?\nAnd everybody was like,\nno, I want to keep going.\nAnd so, you know, by Wednesday,\nthey're like totally zeroed\nout on the depression scales,\nyou know, even better than\nmost people walking around.\nLike really no anxiety,\nno depression or anything.\nBy Thursday, the first\nguy that told me this,\nhe came in and he said,\n\"You know, I was driving back to my hotel\nand I decided to go to the\nbeach and I just sat there\nand I was totally present\nin the present moment\nfor an hour.\"\nAnd he's like,\n\"I read about this in\nmy mindfulness books,\nbut I experienced it last night\nand I've never experienced\nanything like this before.\"\nAnd I was like, hmm, that's interesting,\nbut kind of wasn't sure.\nAnd then I didn't tell\nobviously any more patients\nabout that, and then about five\nover the last couple of years,\nwhen they remit early in the week,\nby the end of the week they're\nlike going to the beach\nand they're like totally\nhaving what people describe\nas a pretty mindful present\nmoment sort of experience,\nwhich is really interesting,\nyou know, what that is.\nI mean, I don't have full on\nscientific data to tell you,\nbut it's just an\ninteresting anecdote, right?\nThat folks, when you push\nthem through this point\nof feeling kind of clinically well\nthat some people end up\nreporting this additional set\nof features.\n- You mentioned the cingulate\nand the anterior cingulate in particular.\nBecause now I feel like for\nthe first time in my career,\nI have some sense of\nwhat prefrontal cortex\nmight actually be doing\nbesides providing a bumper\nfor the rest of the brain.\nThe cingulate, it seems, is\na more primitive structure\nin the sense that ideally\nit's under the regulation\nof this top down control\nfrom prefrontal cortex,\nbut what's mapped in the cingulate?\nAnd for the non neuroscientist\nout there, when I say mapped,\nif we were to put someone in a scanner\nand focus in on cingulate or\nput an electrode in there,\nwhat makes the neurons in there fire?\nWhat sorts of things in\nthe body and in the mind\nand out in the world light up,\nfor lack of a better phrase,\nthe cingulate?\nWhat does the cingulate like?\n- Yeah, yeah, so that Stroop task,\nthose incongruent word color associations,\nthe dorsal part of that.\nFor obsessive compulsive\ndisorder patients,\ncertain kind of triggers.\nYou'll see some of the neural\nimaging studies will point\nto anterior cingulate.\nIn the kind of very crude\npsychosurgery world 50 years ago,\nthe anterior cingulotomy was a way\nof treating obsessive\ncompulsive disorder, right?\n'Cause that area seems to\nbe overactive in people\nwho are experiencing\nobsessive compulsive disorder.\nYou can kind of walk, the\ncingulate wraps around, you know,\nthis white matter track like\nbundles, it wraps around that.\nAnd so there's a part that's above that,\naround that, and below that,\nand depending upon how much\nof the conflict task has\nan emotional component,\nthe more ventral and\nsubgenual that activation is.\nSo the dorsal part of the\nanterior cingulate seems\nto be kind of more of a pure cognitive,\nmaybe obsessive compulsive\ndisorder sort of area.\nWhereas when you start getting\ninto mood sorts of triggers,\nlike facial expression conflicts\nwhere you're supposed to,\nyou know, there's an emotional Stroop task\nwhere you show the word happy\nand then you have a face\nof a person that looks mad,\nthen that's another way\nof having the same sort\nof Stroop conflict.\nThat seems to be more perigenual,\nsubgenual areas, right?\nSo you can kind of,\nyou can trigger the\ncingulate based off the level\nof emotional valence\nfrom none down to a lot.\nAnd that seems to be how it's distributed.\nThere are, you know, heart\nrate kind of components to it\nand autonomic components in there too.\nThere's something called akinetic mutism,\nyou know, I'm a board\ncertified neuropsychiatrist,\nbehavioral neurologist,\nand I've seen, you know,\na lot of these what we call\nzebra cases in neurology\nwhere people have, you know,\nthese unusual neurological presentations\nand one of them is akinetic mutism.\nSo if you have a glioma sitting\nin the inner hemispheric fissure\nand kind of having\npressure on the cingulate,\npeople can get into an almost\ncatatonic looking state\nwhere they kind of get\nstuck and they don't speak.\nAnd so that tells you something\nabout how the cingulate\nworks as well, right?\nIt's like if it's not functioning,\nthen people have a hard\ntime kind of connecting\nwith reality.\nIt seems to need to be constantly online\nto be able to interact\nwith the exterior world.\n- Is it involved in some\nof the dissociative states\nthat sometimes people\nwho are very stressed\nor depressed experience?\nYou said catatonia being an extreme one,\nbut I know someone for instance,\nthat when they get really stressed,\nand it can even be if\nsomeone yells at them\nor even if someone's angry with them\nor they perceive\nsomeone's angry with them,\nthere's a developmental backstory\nto why they likely feel this way,\nthey sort of just kind of can't...\nThis is a high functioning\nindividual normally,\nand they just sort of can't function.\nThey can't complete\nsimple things like email\nor groceries or things for a short while.\nIt's almost like a catatonia\nand they refer to it as\na dissociative state.\nDo you see that in depression?\nAnd I mean, we're speculating here\nas to whether or not that\ninvolves a cingulate,\nbut what you're saying holds\na lot of salience for me\nin thinking about this example.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nThere's, so you see catatonia\nas an extreme outcome\nof depression and sometimes schizophrenia\nand other illnesses.\nDissociation is an extreme outcome,\nor even in some cases,\na less extreme outcome\nof PTSD and trauma.\nAnd you know,\nand it's also a phenomenon\nthat happens naturally\nin some people that are\nhighly hypnotizable.\nAnd so if you ask David Spiegel,\nhe'd say that, you know,\nsome of the work that\nhe's been working on is\naround posterior cingulate in\nthe capacity to disassociate.\nBut yeah, you know, with our\nstimulation approach to DLPFC,\ndorsal anterior cingulate,\none of the subscales\nthat moved the most was\nthe dissociative subscale\nfor hypnotizability.\nSo even in a normal individual, you know,\nyou see that change\nin that kind of experience\nof dissociation.\n- I am highly hypnotizable.\nDavid's hypnotized me a number of times.\nIn fact, we have a clip of that\non our Huberman Live clips channel.\nI've always, well, always.\nStarting at my early teens,\nI started exploring hypnosis.\nI'm extremely hypnotizable.\nAnd self hypnosis or assisted hypnosis.\nI don't know that I ever go\ninto dissociative states.\nI'll try and avoid forcing you\ninto running a clinical session right now,\nbut to assess anything like that.\nBut this brings about something\nreally interesting, I think,\nwhich is I'm aware that some\nof the more popular emerging\ntreatments for depression\ninclude things like ketamine,\nwhich is a dissociative anesthetic.\nIs that right?\n- Yep.\n- And my assumption is that\nas a dissociative anesthetic,\nthat it leads to dissociative states\nwhere people can sort of\nthird person themselves\nand feel somewhat distanced\nfrom their emotions.\nI've also been hearing that\nthere are emerging treatments,\npsilocybin being one of them,\nbut some other treatments,\nMDMA, et cetera, that we'll\nparse each of these in detail,\nthat lead to the exact opposite state\nduring the effect of the drug,\nwhich is a highly engaged emotionality\nand heart rate and sense of self.\nAnd can also lead to relief of depression.\nNow, whether or not this, again,\nreflects that depression\nis many conditions\nas opposed to just one,\nor whether or not somehow tickling\nor in some cases pushing really\nhard on the opposite ends\nof the scale really matter,\nI am absolutely fascinated,\nand again, also perplexed by this.\nWhy would it be that a drug\nthat induces dissociative states\nand a drug taken separately\nthat induces hyper-associative\nstates would lead to relief\nof the same condition?\n- Yeah, no, that's a great question.\nYeah, so for ketamine, you know,\nthe level of dissociation\nappears to be correlated\nwith the therapeutic effect.\nIt appears to be necessary\nbut not sufficient\nto produce an antidepressant effect.\nAnd so folks that don't have\nany psychological change\nfrom the ketamine or don't\nexperience any dissociation\ntypically tend to have less\npotent antidepressant effects\nfrom ketamine.\nWe did a study a couple of years ago,\nit was really interesting.\nSo we gave folks naltrexone,\nwhich is an opiate antagonist,\nmu and kappa opiate receptor antagonist.\nAnd we gave folk, the same individuals,\na pill of that or a pill of placebo,\nand they had no idea which\none they were getting.\n- Was this low dose naltrexone?\n- [Nolan] 50 milligrams,\nso it's pretty high dose.\n- Okay.\n- Yeah, and so we gave a typical\nketamine therapeutic dose,\nand then we gave 50 milligrams\nof naltrexone or placebo.\nAnd then in the same individuals,\nwe gave two infusions, one\nwith each of those conditions.\nAnd if they had an antidepressant effect,\nwe waited until they relapsed\nand then we gave 'em the other condition.\nAnd then we looked to see what effect\nof blocking the opioid receptor,\nwhat effect would you see\non the antidepressant effect\nof blocking the opioid receptor\nwith the idea that if\nketamine works the way\nthat a lot of researchers\nat the time thought that it,\nyou know, completely worked in,\nwhich is the glutamate system,\nthen you would have no\neffect of naltrexone.\n'Cause naltrexone just interacts\nwith the opioid system.\nIt doesn't do anything\nwith any other systems.\nKetamine has a lot of\neffects over, you know,\nit has clear opioid effects in mice\nin various ways of looking at that,\nand an MDA receptor antagonism\nand glutamate effects.\nAnd so if it's just that\nthe glutamate part is\nthe part driving the\nantidepressant effect,\nyou shouldn't have any difference\nin the antidepressant effect\nbetween the two conditions.\nIf, however, the antidepressant\neffect is primarily is\nthe opioid properties of\nketamine are necessary\nfor the antidepressant effect,\nthen you should have a loss\nof antidepressant effect\nduring the ketamine plus\nnaltrexone condition\nthat you observed in the\nketamine plus placebo condition.\nAnd what we saw was that\nthere was a dramatic blockade\nof the antidepressant effect\nwhen naltrexone was present.\nYeah, in the people that\nhad an antidepressant effect\nwith ketamine plus placebo alone.\nAnd then some friends of mine\ndid a TMS study with pain\nand they stimulated\nover the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex\nand they gave IV naloxone,\nwhich works basically the\nsame way as naltrexone,\nand they were able to block\nthe anti-pain effects of TMS\nwith a opiate blocker.\nSo this idea that another kind\nof convergent point, right?\nThis idea that the opioid\nreceptor may have a role\nin mood regulation.\nWhat's also interesting\nis if you look at people\nthat are getting a total knee operation,\nvery painful operation, right?\nYou know, total knee replacement\nand you age, sex, you know,\neverything match the individuals\nthat are going through that.\nBut you have a group of people\nthat don't have depression\nand a group of people\nthat do have depression.\nThe presence of depression triples\nthe oral opioid dose by day four, right?\n- That's required.\n- That's required to cover the pain\nbut what may be happening is\nit's not just treating physical pain,\nmay be treating emotional\npain as well, right?\nAt least transiently,\nit seems to have an antidepressant effect.\nChronically, it seems to have\na very pro-depressant effect.\nIt can make people treatment resistant.\nBut, you know, it's an\ninteresting phenomenon.\nBut yeah, the opioid system\nseems to be pretty involved.\nBut what's interesting there\nwith the ketamine trial is\nthat we didn't see any\neffect on the dissociation.\nAnd so the dissociation\nwas the same each time.\nSo the psychological effect\nof what we call the trip\nor the kind of dissociative effect\nwhere people are having a\npsychological phenomenon\nfrom ketamine, that was\nidentical both times.\nAnd so it kind of, it\nalso challenged this idea\nthat the psychological experience\nof the psychedelic effect\nmay be all that's necessary\nto produce an effect\nand that the pharmacology doesn't matter\nas long as you can achieve that state.\nAnd so, you know,\nwe think we pretty\nclearly debunked that idea\nthat the underlying pharmacology\nand the state, you know,\nseem to be important.\nWe don't know for sure if you can,\na lot of people are working on this,\nif you can take out, you know,\nessentially the psychological effect\nand still have a drug that\nworks to treat the illness\nthat you're trying to target.\nAnd there was a mouse study out this week\nwhere they had an LSD analog\nand they were able to see\nsome animal level data\nto suggest that could be true.\nBut until we figure that out in humans,\nit's kind of to be determined.\nBut it is curious, right?\nBeing able to kind of use\nexperimental manipulations\nto try to separate, you know,\nsome of these phenomenon apart\nand really understand what's doing what.\n- It's so critical\nand it's so critical to\nthe other conversation\nthat we'll surely get to,\nwhich is the progression of psychedelics\nfrom illicit illegal drugs\nto clinically validated,\nand presumably at some point,\neither decriminalized or legal drugs,\nwhich has not yet happened,\nat least not in the US.\nBut just to make sure that\npeople are getting this\nand how crucial this is.\nWhat we're really talking\nabout here is the fact that,\nyou know, if somebody takes a\nmulti gram dose of psilocybin\nor somebody takes MDMA\nor they take ketamine\nand they experience\nrelief from their trauma,\ntheir depression, their addiction,\nor any number of the other things\nthat indeed those compounds\nhave be shown to be useful for\nin certain contexts, clinically\nsupported, et cetera.\nThere's this like\ngravitational pull to the idea\nthat, oh, it was the hallucinations.\nIt was the dissociative state.\nIt was the feeling of connectedness.\nAnd what we're really saying is\nthat while that certainly could be true,\nit may be the case that a major\nsource of the positive shift\nthat occurs after the\neffect of the drug is\nsome underlying biology,\nlike shifts in the mu opioid receptor,\na la your experiments with naltrexone,\nor a change in the\nunderlying neuromodulation\nthat had anywhere from nothing\nto something to do with the real shift.\nAnd I know there's a group up at UC Davis\nthat published a paper in\nnature about a year ago\nalso looking at this is a\nchemistry lab essentially,\nmodifying psychedelics\nto remove the hallucinogenic properties,\nthe mood altering properties,\nand actually seeing some\npretty impressive effects\nand shifts in mood after\nthe drug wears off.\nAnd I know this gets people\nupset when they hear it.\nThis gets a lot of people upset really.\nBecause people think, oh no,\nit's the intense experience that matters.\nBut in fact, that may\nnot be the case at all.\nIn fact, it's so powerful for people\nthat sometimes I liken it\nin my mind to, you know,\nit's like the birth of a new child\nand it's such an incredible experience\nand then people feel so much connection.\nAnd then they sort of\nconnect the experience\nof the actual birth to the connection,\nwhen in fact they're,\nthat's true it turns out,\nbut there are a bunch of\nother things happening too.\nThat's simply the reflection of the fact\nthat you're holding a child\nand the pheromonal effects et cetera.\nSo anyway, I think it's very important\nthat these different\nvariables be figured out.\nAlong those lines, I want to make sure\nthat before we dive a bit deeper\ninto ketamine and psilocybin,\nthat we do touch on really important topic\nthat has been in the press a lot lately,\nwhich is SSRI, selective\nserotonin reuptake inhibitors.\n'Cause we can't really have\na discussion about depression\nwithout talking about SSRIs.\nAnd then I want to circle back\nto ketamine and psilocybin.\nIt seems that there are now data\nthat essentially state\nthat there's no direct link\nbetween serotonin levels and depression.\nAlthough my understanding is\nthat the SSRIs are powerfully effective\nfor certain forms of\nobsessive compulsive disorder\nand may also be effective\nfor treatment of depression,\nbut it may again be through\nsome effect unrelated\nto serotonin itself.\nIs that right?\nAnd how should we think about SSRIs?\nAre they useful, are they not useful?\nWhat's going on with\nSSRIs in your patients\nand in other people as well?\n- Yeah, so the experiment\nthat I described a bit ago\naround the naltrexone and\nketamine was the first time\nI'm aware of where we were\nable to essentially eliminate\nan antidepressant's effect\nby using a second drug\nas a kind of a blockade.\nAnd it highlights a bigger issue, right?\nThe issue that we haven't had a good way\nof really understanding\nhow these drugs work.\nAnd so it's the difference.\nI think a lot of the controversy there is\nthat it's been been difficult, I think,\nfor folks to see that\nsomething can on one hand work\nand on the other hand, we\ndon't know how it works, right?\nAnd so SSRIs clearly work.\nYou know, many, many meta analyses\nkind of proving that out, right?\nThat in a subpopulation of individuals,\nthey achieve great benefit\nfrom depression, you know,\nfor depression, for obsessive\ncompulsive disorder,\nfor generalized anxiety\ndisorder, panic, you know,\nall these things,\nyou can see an improvement\nin those symptoms\nwith what we call SSRIs\nor selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors.\nThe issue there is\nthat these selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors end up\nblocking the reuptake of serotonin\nand leaving the serotonin, you know,\nin this kind of in between,\nbetween two neurons for a while\nand allowing for more\nserotonin to kind of be there.\nThe issue is that they don't\nwork immediately, right?\nSo they don't work like the\nsame day you start taking them.\nAnd that suggests that\nprobably it's not exactly\nthe serotonin being in there\nthat's directly driving it,\nthat it's much more likely\nthat it may have some, say,\nbrain plasticity effects, right?\nWe know that things like brain\nderived neurotrophic factor\nget upregulated with chronic\noral antidepressant use.\nAnd so that's kind of the idea\nis that these things work,\nbut what's powerful,\nand I think with the\nauthors of this paper,\nthis extremely controversial paper,\nwere in part trying to say was\nthat there's not a deficit of serotonin.\nYou're not born with what people\ncall a chemical imbalance.\nAnd psychiatry's known this.\nThis is not actually new\ninformation, anybody, you know,\nand it's kind of a rehashing\nof a bunch of information\nwe've known for a while now,\nbut in the lay press,\nit's kind of hit in a\nway that it didn't seem\nto grab attention before\nwith previous publications.\nBut this idea that this chemical\nimbalance idea is wrong.\nI really think that part's\nimportant because I think that,\nyou know, for a while, I think psychiatry,\nyou know, what I'll call\npsychiatry 1.0, right?\nThis kind of idea of\nFreud and psychotherapy\nand its origins.\nIt was a lot around, you know, your family\nand those experiences and\npsychotherapy kind of going in\nand correcting or helping\nyou to figure out,\nand you know, you being able to see,\nor people hear you so that\nyou can eventually come\nto the conclusion of certain cognitions\nthat aren't helping you, right?\nAnd there's a huge importance there,\nbut there's a history where, you know,\nthings like the schizophrenogenic\nmother and all of that,\nyou know, that was a concept\nat some point, right?\nAnd so we've transitioned\nfrom that to, you know,\nfor a long time the chemical imbalance,\nwhich I'll call psychiatry 2.0.\nYou know,\nthis idea that there's\nsomething chemically missing\nand I think that the\ntrouble there for a patient\nwho's not a physician,\nwho's not someone who's steeped\nin these sorts of ideas,\nwho's, you know, more of kind of a person,\nkind of average American out there, right,\nis that it's sending a message\nof there's something missing with me,\nwhether it be my experiences\nI had no control over\nwhen I was a child or\na chemical in my brain.\nWhat I think is really powerful with TMS,\nyou know, really powerful with TMS,\nand even powerful with\nthe psychedelic story is\nit's saying something different.\nYou know, TMS works and\nthere's no serotonin coming in\nor out of the brain, right?\nAnd we're doing a rapid form of TMS\nthat works in one to five days.\nThere's no, it's very unlikely\nthat there's some long\nterm kind of upregulation\nof serotonin that's driving that.\nSo our work actually kind of pushes back\non this serotonin hypothesis\nas being kind of the center of depression\nbecause it says, look,\nwe're not giving anybody any serotonin.\nWe're simply turning\nthese brain regions on\nand we're focused on the circuitry.\nAnd that's psychiatry 3.0.\nIt's not just like neuromodulation.\nNeuromodulations are\nreally nice, you know,\nuse case for psychiatry 3.0\n'cause it's a way to focally\nand directly perturb brain regions\nin whatever modality you're using.\nBut you know, there are a lot of groups\nthat are actually doing\nneuroimaging before and after,\nand they're able to see\ncircuit level changes\nfor something like psilocybin or ketamine\nlong after the drug is gone, right?\nSuggesting in those same\nbrain regions converge,\nso the subgenual default\nmode network connection\nthat we see is changing\nwith our Stanford neuromodulation\ntherapy technique.\nIt's that same set of brain regions\nthat ketamine and\npsilocybin seem to act on,\nact on these connections\nbetween brain networks\nthat seem to shift.\nAnd so it refocuses the story\non something that's highly correctable.\nAnd it's basically electrophysiology\nand it's basically kind\nof recalibrating a circuit\nthat is recalibrate-able instead\nof I have something missing\nor I have some set of\nexperiences early in life\nthat are going to forever trap me\nin these psychiatric diagnoses.\nAnd so it kind of challenges that idea.\nAnd I think that's what's so\npowerful about psychiatry 3.0.\nThis idea of focusing on the\ncircuit because it gets us\ninto thinking about psychiatry\nand psychiatric illnesses\nas something that are recoverable.\nPeople can get better.\nPeople, you know, we've seen\nwith our TMS techniques,\nwe've seen with some of the\npsychedelic work that we've done\nwhere people are actually\nin normal levels of mood\nfor sustained periods of time or-\n- Within five days.\n- Within five or less days.\nAnd in the case of the psychedelics,\nwithin a few days, right?\nSo we can get people out of these states.\nThey're totally well,\nthere's no drug in their\nsystem in that point,\nin the case of the psychedelics.\nIt was never a drug in their\nsystem, in the case of TMS.\nAnd it just tells us that it's fixable.\nIt's just like the heart.\nIt's just like an arrhythmia in the heart.\nIt's just like, you know,\nthese other illnesses,\nthat it's like a broken leg.\nWe can go in and do something\nand we can get somebody better.\nThen I think what's empowering\nand what a lot of patients\nhave told me is they say,\nyou know, some people will\nrelapse and need more stimulation\nor need more psychedelics\nor whatever it is,\nbut they'll tell me, I've\nrelapsed and I'm depressed again,\nbut I'll never think\nabout killing myself again\nbecause I know that if I\ngo get stimulated again,\nit improves, it gets better.\nI will be able to\nreachieve it and I can't.\nAnd I don't fear that\nI'm chronically broken.\nI don't fear that the\nchemical imbalance is\nstill imbalanced.\nI don't fear that these\nthings that I couldn't control\nin my childhood, you know,\nare going to be there and\ndrive this problem forever.\nAnd I think that's what's\nso powerful about this.\n- [Andrew] The sense of control.\n- The sense of control, the sense of...\nThey're not doing the\nstimulation themselves.\nThey're not administering the drug\nin these trials themselves.\nAnd they probably never will.\nThese will probably be medical treatments.\nBut they are choosing to do it.\nAnd in that sense, they are in control.\n- Yeah, I have a good\nfriend, I won't out him\nfor reasons that'll\nbecome clear in a moment,\nwho was quite obese and\nlost a lot of weight\nand was really proud of himself.\nAnd then I guess we could\nsay he sort of relapsed\nin a sense.\nNot all the way, but far along.\nBut his tone around it was very different.\nHe knew he had accomplished\nwhat his goal once before.\nHe was disappointed in himself,\nbut he knew exactly why he had relapsed.\nIt was very clear.\nHe had essentially relapsed\nto the previous set\nof eating behaviors and\nlack of exercise behaviors\nand has now brought himself back again.\nAnd it just resonates with\nyour story that, you know,\nonce somebody understands they can do it\nbecause they've been there before,\nthis idea again of considering\nnew rules, that there's...\nAnd that brings me to this\nquestion about psychedelics\nand frankly the altered thinking\nand perception that occurs\nin high dose psilocybin clinical sessions.\nIt seems that the disordered thinking,\neven though it could be random, right?\nHearing colors and seeing sounds is\nalways the kind of cliche statement\nof the Timothy Leary area.\nAlso, you know, right there,\nthat's a Stroop task of sorts.\nIt's a synesthesia, it's a\ncombining of perceptions,\nbut it's sort of Stroop task-ish\nin that it's a new set of rules\nfor the same stuff, right?\nAnd many people do report improvements\nin trauma related\nsymptomology and depression,\nas I understand it from my\nread of the clinical trials,\nafter taking psilocybin.\nBecause during those sessions,\nsomething comes to mind spontaneously.\nAs you and I were talking about\nearlier, they will report,\nfor instance, a new way\nof seeing the old problem.\nAnd the old problem could be\nthe voice that they're no good,\nnothing will ever work out,\nor could be even more subtle than that.\nSo that raises two questions.\nOne is about the basic\nfunctioning of the human brain,\nwhich is why do you think\nthe brain would ever hold on\nto rules that don't serve us well?\nThat's one question.\nAnd then the second question is,\nwhat is it about psilocybin\nand related molecules\nin terms of their neurochemistry,\nin terms of the ways they\ndisrupt thinking and feeling,\net cetera, during the session\nthat allow this novel rule\nconsideration phenomenon?\n- Yeah.\nSo the first question,\nI think it's an evolutionary\nneurobiology answer, right?\nI think that at the individual\nperson level, you know,\nit doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nthat when we're really stressed out,\nsome of us want to eat more, right?\nAt the individual person level\n'cause it's like,\nthat's not particularly\nthat good for my health\nin the long term.\nBut if you think about it, like, you know,\nin some 500 years ago, 1,000 years ago,\nif I'm highly stressed out,\nit's most likely that I'm\nabout to not have food\nat some point and I\nshould eat a bunch of food\nthat is high fat, high\nsugar, high carb food\nto put on weight for that next phase\nwhere in this stress I may be in battle\nand I don't have food\nand I have enough fuel on board, right?\nAnd so we end up being a result\nof probably a lot of biology\nthat's not that useful\nin the modern era.\nAnd I think in the brain for,\nsay, let's say PTSD, right?\nA lot of veterans come back\nand they experience these PTSD symptoms\nand they're not at all\nuseful back home, right?\nYou know, they hear some loud noise\nand all of a sudden they're behind a car\nor they're behind a, you\nknow, I've heard of folks,\nyou know, jump and run behind a trashcan\nor whatever in the middle of San Francisco\nwhen they hear a loud noise.\nBut if you put them\nback in the battlefield.\n- [Andrew] Highly adaptive.\n- That's highly adaptive, right?\nAnd so I think what's\ninteresting is that we,\nin the absence of using\nsubstances like psychedelics,\nend up having these\nvery persistent memories\nthat are attached to\nnegatively balanced emotion,\npredominantly, as you were saying earlier,\nthe jacket in elementary school, you know,\nI had various things like\nthat for me too, right?\nYou remember these things.\nAnd we hold onto those things\nfrom I think an evolutionary\nneurobiology standpoint,\nbut what seems to, for whatever reason,\nkind of alleviate that\nare these substances,\nsome new like MDMA,\nsome that have been around\nfor thousands of years,\nlike psilocybin, and used as\na sacrament in traditions,\nseem to have a therapeutic effect.\nIt seems to be pretty long\nlasting for these phenomenon.\nAnd so it's just curious, right?\nIt's curious that in the absence of that,\nthese things will keep going on and on,\nbut in the presence of that exposure,\nthen all of a sudden you see\na resolution of the problem.\nAnd we have some work now\nwe're treating folks with,\nNavy SEALs, and the data's\nstill being analyzed.\nBut the anecdotes that\nwe're getting, right,\nare folks are coming\nback and they're saying\nit's finally gone, right?\nThese set of PTSD\nsymptoms are finally gone.\nAnd so this idea that for whatever reason,\ngoing into what's probably\na highly plastic state\nlike we were talking about earlier,\nupregulation of brain\nderived neurotrophic factor\nin the case of ibogaine, glial\nderived neurotrophic factor,\nthis highly plastic state and the ability\nto kind of re-experience memories.\nAnd then as you know,\nwe always reconsolidate a\nmemory when we bring it back up,\nwe always reconsolidate it.\nBut reconsolidating it in that\nstate, for whatever reason,\nmay drive a therapeutic effect.\nAnd, you know, the jury's still out.\nI would say that I'm kind of an agnostic\nto what tool I'm using kind of guy.\nLike my business is to find\ntreatments that help people.\nAnd so I'm much more like\npragmatic about it, you know.\nIf this sort of thing, which\nhas a lot of cultural baggage,\nbut if this sort of thing\nultimately ends up being therapeutic,\nif we can design trials\nthat convince me and others\nthat it is, then we\nshould absolutely use it.\nYou know?\nAnd if it doesn't, then we\nclearly shouldn't use it, right?\nAnd I think that's a big question\nthe field's going to have to work out.\nWe have a hard time blinding these trials\nbecause the placebo condition is not easy\nto pull off, obviously.\n- A placebo for a psilocybin\njourney is hard to imagine.\n- We've got, you know, we've\nbeen thinking about this\nand maybe that ketamine study\nthat I was talking about earlier,\nif we could give people\nnaltrexone and ketamine,\nmaybe that's a good sort of\nplacebo condition, right?\n'Cause we know that we can block any\nof the actual antidepressant\neffects of ketamine,\nthey still have an experience, you know.\nAnd so that's one way of doing it.\nBut thinking about ways to do that\nand really kind of proving this out.\nAnd that's been, yeah,\nI think that's been kind of central\nto the way I've been thinking about this.\nBut yeah, I think there's the\nwork that's been done so far,\nthe first psilocybin trial,\nthe first MDMA trial was published\nin \"Nature Medicine\" recently.\n- And what do those generally say?\nI mean, that they are effective\nfor a number of people\nafter one session, two sessions?\nWhat's sort of the general contour of?\nAnd let's start with psilocybin and MDMA.\n- Yeah, so MDMA appears to,\nin one to a few MDMA sessions,\nhave an anti PTSD effect\nthat seems to be, you know,\noutside of the kind of\nstandard assumed levels\nof PTSD improvement that you\ncan observe in individuals\nwith this level of PTSD, right?\nSo what we call the effect size,\nwhich is essentially like a effect size,\nthe measure that allows for you\nto compare different\ntreatments to each other\nfor different conditions\nthat are, you know, agnostic\nto what the actual illness is.\nYou know, the effect\nsize is there, you know,\napproach effect size is the\nthings that are pretty effective\nlike antacids for heartburn, right?\nAnd you see that with MDMA treatment.\n- So does that mean that\nfor people that have trauma,\nand again, we're talking\nabout in a clinical setting,\nthey take a one or two doses of MDMA.\nI think the standard maps\ndose is 150 to 175 milligrams.\nAgain, doing this with\na physician, et cetera,\ncontrol clinical trial, legal.\n- [Nolan] Yep, exactly.\n- They do it once or twice.\nAnd broadly speaking,\nwhat percentage of people\nwho had trauma report\nfeeling significant relief\nfrom their trauma afterward?\n- It's about 2/3 of people had\na clinically significant\nchange in their PTSD.\n- That's impressive.\n- [Nolan] Which is impressive, right?\n- And how long lasting was that?\nI mean, these trials were\nended pretty recently, so...\n- Yeah, it appears to last for a while.\nIn the earlier trials where\nthey followed people out,\nit seemed to last for\nkind of in the years range\nfor some people.\nAnd so it's, you know,\nit's pretty compelling.\nPsilocybin, you know, and\ncontrast that with ketamine,\nwhich only on average lasts\nabout a week and a half\nfor a single infusion,\nso it's a much shorter.\n- So they have to get\nrepeated infusions of ketamine\nevery 10 days or so?\nForever?\n- For some people, or they end up getting\nlike a bunch of doses\nfor a couple of weeks.\nAnd then for some people\nthat seems to last a while.\nYou know, that's where I\nthink the psilocybin story\nfor depression and the\nMDMA story for PTSD seemed\nmore interesting to me.\n- So for psilocybin, what\nis the rough percentages on,\nand this would be relief not from trauma,\nbut from depression, correct?\n- Yeah, yeah, exactly.\nSo it's, you know, in open label studies,\nit's closer to like half\nto 2/3 of people end up\ngetting better depending upon their level\nof treatment resistance.\nIn the blinded trials it was\nmore like 1/3 or so of people,\nyou know, experienced relief.\nAnd this is, you know, this is\na press release of the data,\nyou know, and so it\nhasn't, to my knowledge,\nit hasn't been published yet.\nAnd so I'm looking forward\nto seeing the full paper\non that one.\nBut it, you know, separated from placebo\nand looks pretty good as well.\nIt looks like it's, you know,\nthe first of two trials\nthat need to be done\nto get this thing approved\nfor treatment resistant depression.\nAnd so that stuff looks good.\n- In terms of MDMA, for\nmany years it was reported\nin the popular press\nand there was a paper published in science\nthat MDMA was neurotoxic,\nthat it would kill serotonin neurons.\nThis was what was always said.\nThen I saw another paper\npublished in science\nthat wasn't a retraction\nof the previous paper,\nbut rather was a second\npaper in the same group\nthat essentially admitted\nthat the first time around,\nthey had injected these\nmonkeys with not MDMA,\nbut with methamphetamine, which\nis known to be neurotoxic.\nSo it was kind of a\npublic admittance of oops\nor like really big screw up, so oops,\nbut never a retraction\nand then never really a\npublicly acknowledged correction\nin the popular press.\nSo it seems that in the\nappropriate dosage range,\nand with these one or two sessions,\nmy assumption, and this\nagain is an assumption,\ntell me if I'm right or wrong here,\nis that MDMA is not neurotoxic\nfor serotonergic neurons\nat appropriate doses and\nwith appropriate sourcing,\net cetera.\n- So it was an interesting study that,\nI think the guy's name is\nHalpern, last name's Halpern.\n- [Andrew] Not Casey Halpern.\n- Not, different Halpern.\nI think Joshua Halpern,\nI'm blanking on his first name, but...\n- Casey Halpern was a\nguest on this podcast\nand is a former colleague\nof ours at Stanford,\nwho unfortunately we lost to\nUniversity of Pennsylvania\nand maybe someday we'll bring him back.\n- Yeah, that's right.\nSo this individual, you know,\nreceived some NIH funding\nto actually, NIDA, you know,\nNational Institute for Drug Abuse funding\nto explore individuals of\nthe Mormon faith in Utah\nwho partake in only MDMA.\nSo the way this works is\nthat MDMA happened kind of after a lot\nof the religious documents were developed.\nAnd so MDMA isn't on the\nprohibited drug list.\n- The banned substance list.\n- [Nolan] The banned substance list.\n- I have some good friends who are LDS.\n- Yeah, great people.\nI do as well, you know,\njust a kind of set of facts, you know.\nAnd so these folks only\nuse MDMA but they don't,\nthey're not, you know,\nthe problem with some people using drugs,\nthey're poly substance users, right?\nSo you can't say it's the MDMA\nif they've also taken other psychedelics\nand they've taken opiates\nand they've taken cocaine,\nand you have this picture\nwhere you can't really\ntease out that problem.\nBut with this, right,\nit was just individuals that\nwere part of the Mormon faith.\nAnd so they were kind of purist\nin the sense they only used MDMA\nand he confirmed all of that.\nAnd it was a brilliant study, right?\nBecause then he was able to go in\nand look at their cognitive profiles\nversus individuals of the same\ngeography, the same faith,\nall of that, that\nhappened to not take MDMA\nand found there were no\nneurocognitive differences.\n- So does that mean that\nit was not damaging?\n- It was not damaging.\nIt's hard to know because to\nreally do this study well,\nyou'd have to track these folks down\nbefore they ever took\nMDMA and do a pre-post\nand compare to people that didn't.\nBut, you know, this is\nabout as good of a study\nas you can do, given the situation,\nto be able to check this out.\nAdditionally, when I\nwas back in Charleston\nand working in the Medical\nUniversity of South Carolina,\none of my mentors there, Dr. Wagner,\nwas a neuropsychologist at MUSC\nand he was also the neuropsychologist\nfor the early MDMA trials.\nAnd so he did all the\nneurocognitive batteries\nfor individuals pre-post\nand similarly did not see any changes\nin neurocognitive profiles\nin a negative way.\nAnd so, you know,\nthere's data from experimental\npatients receiving this.\nThere's data from people\nthat are chronic users,\nyou know, who only take MDMA.\nAnd that combination of data suggests\nthat there's certainly no apparent risk\nin the kind of one to\ntwo to three dose range.\nAnd it's probably unlikely\nthat at least, you know,\nmodest dose exposure over\na lifetime doesn't appear\nto have a profound neurocognitive\ndamaging effect, yeah.\n- Interesting.\nYeah, I know that sourcing\nis key and we're here,\nwe're talking about clinical\ntrials where purity is assured.\nAnd you know,\nyears ago when so-called\nraves were really popular,\nmaybe they're still\npopular, never been to one,\nso wouldn't know if\nthey're happening or not.\nThat's how in the know I am.\nBut it was clear that, you know,\ntesting for purity was important\nbecause sometimes the drugs are made\nsuch that there are contaminants\nlike methamphetamine,\nwhich we know is highly neurotoxic.\nI think that one reason why people think\nthat MDMA might be neurotoxic\nis the reported drop in energy\nor sort of feeling fatigued\nfor a few days afterward.\nI spoke to a physician colleague of ours\nwho said that that very\nlikely has something to do\nwith the surge in prolactin\nthat arrives subsequent\nto the big dopamine surge\nthat occurs in MDMA.\nAnd I mention that because I\nknow a number of people talk\nabout serotonin depletion\nafter taking MDMA.\nHe has it in mind that\nwhile that could be true,\nit's likely that anytime\nsomebody takes something\nor does something where there's\na huge lift in dopamine,\nthat there's very likely a\nhuge compensatory increase\nin prolactin that follows\nand prolactin has a\nkind of sedative effect,\nnumbing effect on mood\nand libido, et cetera,\nthat eventually also wears off.\nDoes that make sense\nto you as a physician?\n- Yeah, it makes sense.\nI mean, you know,\nthe difference between,\nsay, MDMA and psilocybin is\nthat MDMA is kind of an\namphetamine of sorts, right?\nSo it has effects in dopamine\nand psilocybin's, you\nknow, pretty neutral,\nand you know, maybe a little\nbit of dopamine effects,\nbut kind of much more of a\nserotonergic focused drug.\nAnd so yeah,\nI think you're going to see kind\nof a different profile after.\nAnd that makes, I\nhaven't heard that story,\nbut that makes sense to me too.\n- Since you mentioned psilocybin,\nlet's talk a little bit\nabout the neurochemistry of psilocybin.\nAs a serotonergic agent, my\nunderstanding is it operates\non these, is it the 5HT\nserotonin 2C receptor?\n- 2A.\n- 2A, excuse me.\n2A and receptors.\nAnd that I've seen a\nbunch of different reports\nin terms of what it's\nactually doing to the brain\nwhile people are under\nthe effects of the drug.\nAnd this is important\nfor us to segment out\nbecause there are the effects that happen\nwhile people are under the influence\nand then the more long lasting effects.\nBut some of the effects I've\nheard about are, for instance,\nand tell me again if\nthese are right or wrong,\nthat there is increased\nactivation of lateral connection,\nsort of broader areas of\nthe brain being coactive\nthan would normally occur.\nMaybe that explains some of\nthe synesthesias, you know,\nseeing sounds and hearing colors\nand that as the trivial example,\nbut rule breaking within the mind.\nBut then I've also heard that\nperhaps it's lack of gating\nof sensory input.\nSo normally if I'm looking at something,\nI'm not thinking about the\nsensation in my right toe\nunless it's relevant.\nBut if I'm thinking about the\nsensation in my right toe,\nI'm generally not thinking\nabout the truck around the corner.\nSo we have these attentional spotlights,\nbut that somehow it creates\na more, it adds spotlights.\n- Yeah, degates the thalamus.\n- Degates the thalamus, right,\nthrough the particular thalamic structure.\nSo what is the evidence\nthat any of that is true?\nAnd are there other phenomena?\nIs there involvement of\ndorsolateral prefrontal cortex\nthat we are aware of?\nAnd what I'm really headed\nhere in a few minutes is,\nyou know, is there a place\nfor combining directed\nstimulation of the brain\nwith psychedelics so that the effects\nof serotonin could be\nprimarily within the structures\nthat you know from your work\nto be relevant to depression.\nSo, but to simplify it first,\nwhat's going on when one takes psilocybin\nand why is it interesting\nin light of depression?\n- Yeah, definitely.\nSo David Nutt and Robin\nCarhart-Harris' work\naround neuroimaging\npsychedelics are kind of\nsome of the first folks to do that work.\nAnd to their great surprise,\nthey thought there was going\nto be an increase in activity\non psychedelics and what they\nfound is the opposite, right?\nThere's kind of an overall decrease\nin the level of activity in\nthe brain with psychedelics,\nbut they've also looked at connectivity\nand there's this kind of\nsmall world, you know,\nlarge world connectivity\nthat you think about.\nAnd so, you know, small world meaning\nthere's kind of a much\nmore kind of focused\nkind of cortical function\nor, you know, sub-cortical\nfunction or whatever it is.\nAnd what you see is a difference\nin that level of engagement\nof brain regions,\nthe connectivity, kind\nof global connectivity,\nto your point, kind of increases.\nAnd so, you know, it's\ninteresting, you know,\nI think to kind of have a\nconversion theory on this.\nIt's still, you know, to be determined.\nThere's still a lot of work I\nthink that needs to be done.\nBut it's certainly suggestive\nthat there's pretty profound\nchanges in brain activity\nand brain connectivity after.\nAnd what we've found to\nbe really interesting is\nthat the anti-depressant\neffects of psilocybin have\na particular connectivity change\nthat we also see with our\nTMS approaches, right?\nAnd it's this connectivity\nbetween the subgenual anterior cingulate\nand the default mode network.\nAnd so when we do\nthis effective Stanford\nneuromodulation therapy stimulation,\nwe see a down regulation, the\nconnectivity between them,\nnegatively balanced mood state\nin the case of depressed individuals\nand the self-representation of the brain.\nAnd you see that same\nconnectivity change occur\npost-psilocybin, you know,\nsuggesting there's a convergent mechanism\nand it makes sense, right?\nYou've kind of got\nan overconnected,\nnegatively balanced system,\nconflict system that's kind of attached\nonto the self representation\nand people feel stuck, right?\nAnd then when you do whatever\nyou do that's effective,\nit unpairs those two systems.\n- I want to ask you about this\nphenomenon I've heard about\nduring psilocybin journeys.\nI heard about this from\nDr. Matthew Johnson,\nwho's running a lot of the\nclinical trials at Johns Hopkins\nand has been a guest on this podcast.\nHe said that there's something\nseems to be important\nabout the patient who's depressed\nor who's under the influence of psilocybin\nor the patient who's\ntrying to get over smoking\nor an eating disorder\nwho's taking psilocybin\nand is in the clinic.\nThat there's something important\nto this notion of letting go,\nthat people will feel as if their thoughts\nand their feelings\nand maybe even their body\naren't under their control,\nand that the clinicians' job\nunder those circumstances is\nof course to make sure that\nthey're physically safe\nso they don't jump out a window or try...\nActually give an example of\na patient who thought that,\nI think it was a she,\ncould move into the painting in the wall,\nand obviously that wasn't\ntrue in the real world,\nalthough it was true in her mind.\nSo they prevented her from doing that.\nBut that letting go,\nthat somehow untethering\nfrom the autonomic arousal\nthat's occurring is important.\nWhich brings us back to this\nidea or me back to this idea\nof like a seesaw where\nyou're sort of letting go\nof the hinge and just sort of,\nyour heart rate's going up,\nlike just go with it and trust, you know?\nYour heart rate's going down,\njust go with it and trust.\nYou're thinking about\nsomething very powerful\nand depressing related to your childhood,\nyou're just supposed to\ngo there without fear.\nYou're thinking about what's possible\nin terms of what could happen.\nSo anyway, you get the picture.\nCan we think of that\nas just the willingness to do\na million different variations\non the emotional Stroop task?\nYou know, you'll entertain\nthe full array of rules\nwithin your head and consider them.\nOr is there something more to it?\nYou know, and again,\nwe're in the outer margins\nof understanding here,\nbut what are your thoughts\non this notion of letting go\nas such a key variable\nfor relief from depression\nduring the psychedelic journey?\n- Yeah, so I'll talk a little bit\nabout something called exposure\nand response prevention therapy,\nthat's a typical kind of gold\nstandard treatment for OCD,\nand I'll help this a\nlittle bit conceptually.\nAnd so what that really is,\nit's a letting go therapy.\nAnd so, you know, exposure\nresponse prevention,\nthe idea is that you have\nto expose the individual\nto something that, you know,\nsomething that triggers an obsession\nthat they then want to do\nwhatever the compulsion is, right?\nAnd so I'll give you, you know,\nmy first exposure and\nresponse prevention patient\nwhen I was a resident,\nhe was very concerned about\nleaving the lights on his car.\nAnd so what we did is we went out\nand we turned the lights on in\nhis car and locked his door.\nSo his lights were on,\nand he was super worried, this\nis going to kill his battery.\nAnd we went and we spent an\nhour talking about things,\nand we went back out to his\ncar and his battery was fine,\nand his lights were on.\nAnd he cranked the car and we\ndid it maybe one other time,\nand then all of a sudden\nthat was gone, right?\nAnd that's the idea is that, you know,\nyou're essentially exposing.\nAnd you want to do it at levels\nthat are, from an anxiety\nstandpoint, tolerable,\nbut exposing the person to something\nand then letting them see\nthat that exposure ends\nup being fine, right?\nIt ends up not causing the thing\nthat they end up being worried about.\nAnd so, you know, in some sense,\nbeing in the psychedelic state,\nand we are all taught at a level\nto retain some level of control.\nYou know, people have\nmore or less of that,\nbut we're all effectively\nretaining some level of control.\nWe all wake up in the\nmorning and put clothes on\nto go into society.\nWe all try to say, you know,\nmost people try to say the right things.\nThey don't try to do things\nthat are outside of cultural norms\nwhen they're in conversation.\nAnd so we're constantly\nat some level controlling\nthe situation that we're in.\nAnd so it's, you know, it's not,\nit makes a lot of sense\nthat in that state,\npart of the therapeutic effect\nthat may be linked to the\nneural circuitry is this idea\nof letting go and essentially\nletting the system, you know,\nthe network configuration\nmaybe, whatever it is,\nassume a state\nthat you've essentially been\nfighting the whole time.\nThe same way that my OCD\npatient was fighting this need\nto click the off button on\nthe lights of his car 50 times\nbefore he would go and do\nwhatever he needed to do.\nAnd in some level, letting go there,\nmeaning letting us just turn the lights on\nand him not do anything,\nor letting go meaning in\nthe psychedelic state,\nyou're just letting go\nof whatever it is you're holding onto,\nnegatively balanced\nthoughts about yourself\nin the setting of having depression\nor, you know, re-experiencing\na trauma memory\nand allowing that to just happen\nand seeing it again\nthrough a different light.\nYou know, it feels the same\nin the sense that that's\nallowing for whatever's going on\nwith these psychedelic states\nto do whatever they do.\n- It's fascinating.\nYou said it's exposure response therapy is\nthe traditional name?\n- [Nolan] Exposure response\nprevention therapy.\n- Prevention therapy.\nDone outside of the psychedelic journey.\n- It's done outside the\npsychedelic journey.\nBut that idea of letting go\nis present in both of those.\nYou know, psychotherapy\nkind of straight up,\ntotally sober, non psychedelic,\nnon anything psycho manualized,\nthat psychotherapy that we\nknow works really well for OCD.\nAnd then, you know, in\nthat psychedelic state,\nand so people have done\nstudies with psilocybin,\nand now there's some studies\nwith MDMA trying to look\nat treating OCD, you know,\nwith this same sort of\nidea of letting go, right?\nAnd how do you have an OCD\npatient kind of let go?\nMaybe even letting go of not\nwashing their hands anymore,\nyou know, kind of accepting the idea\nthey're not going to\nget germs in their hands\nor whatever it is, you know?\nAnd so it's kind of part and parcel,\nthat same sort of thinking.\n- When I was in college,\nI developed a compulsive superstition.\nI'm not afraid to admit this.\nI somehow developed a\nknock on wood superstition.\nAnd I was actually kind of ashamed of it\nbecause it rationally made no sense.\nI don't consider myself\na superstitious person,\nnever was a superstitious kid.\nYou know, I'd step on the sidewalk cracks,\nI'd walk under ladders, you know,\nI'd probably even try\nto walk under a ladder,\neven though I don't suggest it.\nBut somehow I picked this thing up\nand I used to sneak it at times.\nI told my girlfriend at\nthe time that I had it\nin hopes that that would\nprevent me from doing it.\nAnd it's tricky.\nSometimes it actually comes\nback where I think, gosh,\nI didn't say, you know, knock on wood,\nI didn't knock on wood, I hope\nthat doesn't actually happen.\nAnd it's quote unquote crazy, right?\nBut crazy in the sense that\nit makes no sense rationally\nwhy the events would be linked.\nAnd yet I think a lot of\npeople out there do have\ninternal superstitions.\nMaybe by talking about\nit now, it'll go away.\nClearly I just need to challenge it.\nYou know, anyway, I mention\nit because I consider myself,\nyou know, generally rational person,\nbut it's interesting how these\nmotor patterns get activated\nand this notion of letting go,\nbecause I don't actually\nknow what consequence I fear.\nAnd the fear, as I was\nhearing the example you gave,\nyou know, the fear of the\ncar battery running down,\nI was about to say,\n\"Well, what if the battery\nactually did run out?\"\nThen the therapy would be undermined.\nAnd yet that could also\nbe interesting too,\nbecause it's not that big of a deal.\nYou jump the car.\nBut in my case,\nI need to think about\nwhat the ultimate fear is.\n- Yeah, and you know, I\nthink a lot of people,\nso it's interesting if you\nlook at, say, the OCD scale\nor the depression scale or whatever,\nwe don't define normal as zero.\nWe define normal as\nsome number range above.\nSo zero to, in the case\nof the Montgomery-Asberg\nDepression Rating Scale,\none of the depression\nscales we use, 10, right?\nThat's the normal range.\nAnd so people could have some sadness\nand still be considered normal.\nIn the case of the OCD scale,\nit's about the same 10, right?\nWhere we say it's kind of\nstarts to be, you know,\nmildly abnormal or something.\nAnd I'd always tell the medical students,\n\"Look, my friends that\nare surf instructors,\nthey're more like a zero on the Y bar.\nPeople that are professionals,\nyou know, they're non-zero,\nbut it's still within the normal range.\"\nAnd especially, you know,\nin the case that you're talking about,\nit doesn't sound like it got in your way.\nIt doesn't sound, I mean,\nyou're obviously highly\nsuccessful tenured professor\nat Stanford and do all the\ngreat things that you do.\nAnd so it's very much kind\nof within the normal range,\nand I think totally assumed\nthat a lot of people have\nthese sorts of things.\nAnd as long, I think something\nas a psychiatric diagnosis\nwhen it severely impairs\nyour ability to function\nand that's when we kind\nof cross that threshold.\nBut, you know, I think\nthat a lot of people,\nand it's great that\nyou're bringing this up.\nI mean, it's very anti-stigmatizing\nthat you're bringing up, right?\nBecause I think a lot of\npeople hold that stuff in\nand they don't want to talk\nabout it because they're worried\nthat somebody else may think something.\nBut the reality is, as a psychiatrist,\nI talk to a lot of patients,\na lot of people that are,\nyou know, family members,\nyou know, folks that are just going\nthrough a death in the\nfamily, whatever it is.\nAnd what you figure out is like,\neverybody's got a little\nsomething here and there.\nEverybody has the knock in\nsome way, if that makes sense.\nAnd it's just, and we're all\njust kind of more predisposed\nnot to talk about it.\nBut I think it's\nimportant to talk about it\nbecause I think that when we\nstart all talking about it,\nthen we realize that we're\nall kind of in this together\nin a way.\nAnd then some folks that\nhave to knock 100 times,\nwe call that OCD, you know,\nand they're worried about germs\nand all these other things.\nWe call that OCD.\nAnd then in that circumstance, you know,\nthey need treatment, right?\nBut it is really on,\njust like blood sugar,\njust like blood pressure,\nit's on a range, you know,\nand it's not just these\ndiscreet diagnoses.\nYou have them or you don't.\n- It's good to know.\nI actually feel some\nrelief just hearing this,\nbecause I am slightly...\nI wouldn't say ashamed as\nsort of embarrassed by it,\nbut I offer it as a, you know,\nit is what it is, as they say.\nAnd it certainly doesn't\nseem to hinder my life much,\nknock on wood.\n- [Nolan] [laughs] Nice.\n- So if we could talk\na bit about ibogaine.\nI don't know much about ibogaine,\nalthough anytime I hear\nthe, you know, A-I-N-E,\nyou know, lidocaine, ibogaine,\nI think of an anesthetic.\nAnd going to the dentist,\nwhich is an unpleasant\nexperience for me, generally.\nWhat is ibogaine?\nDoes this have anything to\ndo with the so-called toad?\nYou know, people talk about\nsmoking frog skin, toad skin.\nWhat is it used for clinically?\nIs it legal in the US as a clinical tool?\nWho's using it and for what purposes?\nIf you could educate me on ibogaine,\nI truly know nothing about it,\nexcept I think I know how\nto spell it correctly.\n- Yeah, that's fair, yeah.\nSo ibogaine is one of the alkaloids\nthat you can extract from\na iboga tree root bark\nthat's typically growing in\nthe country of Gabon, Africa.\nSo Gabon is one of the\nWest African countries,\nkind of middle of Africa\nand on the west coast.\nAnd Gabon has a group of folks, you know,\ncalled the Bwiti.\nIt's a religious kind of sacramental group\nthat sacramentally uses iboga root bark\nas part of the sacrament.\nAnd they've been using iboga\nroot bark for a very long time.\nAnd it's, you know, part of the tradition.\nThere's a whole set of\nkind of ceremony around it.\nIf you're interested in this,\nthere's a book called\n\"Breaking Open the Head\"\nby Daniel Pinchbeck that goes through\nand talks about this whole process.\nBut essentially the Gabonese\nhave been using this\nfor a long time and it's a kind\nof an atypical psychedelic.\nIt's not a psychedelic that\nwe normally think about\nwith psilocybin and LSD\nwhere there are visual\nperceptual changes, right?\nSo if you take psilocybin or LSD,\nwhat you experience is you experience\nthese kind of visual\nperceptual differences\nin the external world, right?\nAnd on enough LSD or psilocybin,\nan individual can actually\nperceive something visually\nin the external world that isn't there,\nas we talked about earlier.\nIbogaine doesn't do that.\nIbogaine does something different.\nIt's kind of like, have you\never seen \"Minority Report,\"\nyou know, the movie with Tom Cruise,\nI think 15 or 20 years ago or something?\nSo it dates us a little bit,\nbut it was this movie where\nhe would be able to go\nand see these kind of pre crimes.\nAnd he had this big screen\nwhere he could look at scenes\nfrom time and like kind of go\nthrough that scene and see it.\nAnd so what individuals\ntaking ibogaine will say is\nthat open eyes, they don't see anything,\nbut closed eyes, they'll go back through\nand re-experience earlier life memories\nand they will be able to experience it\nfrom a place of empathy,\nnot only for themselves,\nbut from others, and\nkind of detached empathy\nand being able to see this\nas almost a third party,\neven though they were there.\nBut they're able to see it,\nyou know, as a third party.\nSo Claudia Naranjo, a\npsychiatrist from Argentina,\ndescribed this for a lot\nof books that he wrote,\nin I think the '80s and '90s around this.\nAnd so, you know, ibogaine's\nbeen around for a long time.\nHoward Lotsof,\nAmerican guy that brought\nit over from Africa.\nHe was a polysubstance user,\nused every drug that he\ncould get his hands on,\ntook ibogaine,\nand including a lot of other\npsychedelics, by the way,\ntook ibogaine\nand then never did another\ndrug again, supposedly\nbecause he had such a\nprofound ibogaine experience.\nIbogaine is in no way a\nrecreational substance.\nIt's not a recreational substance\nif you want it to be a\nrecreational substance,\nbecause you're essentially having this,\nwhat they call life review.\nThey also call it 10 years\nof psychotherapy in a night.\nSo these are the terminology\nthat people talk about the issue.\n- How long does it last?\nIs it truly one night?\n- It's usually, you know, it can go,\ndepending upon if you\nget re-dosed or anything,\ngo sometimes, depending upon\nhow fast you metabolize it,\nsometimes 24, sometimes 36 hours.\nSometimes it can be shorter,\nbut it is a long time.\nIt's a very long time.\nSo it's definitely the longest\nacting psychedelic substance\nI know of.\nAnd so people, you will take this,\nand they'll have this\nreevaluation of a given memory.\nAnd then as we were talking about earlier,\nreconsolidate that memory again,\nand then it seems to\nhave, you know, an effect\nof that reconsolidation process.\nAnd so, you know, about\nfive, four, five years ago,\nI was tapped by Robert Malenka,\none of the senior\nneuroscientists we both know\nin the university.\nAnd he says, \"Well,\nthere's an unnamed donor\nthat's very interested\nin funding a scientific,\nkind of open label study\nof these Navy SEALs\nthat have been going down to Mexico\nand taking ibogaine and also 5-MeO-DMT,\"\nwhich I'll talk about in\na second, to treat PTSD.\nYou know, they claim to\nhave traumatic brain injury,\ndepression, you know, that\nwhole constellation of symptoms.\nYou know, and as it was described to me\nby various people that had done this,\nby their spouses and\nand whatnot, you know,\nJohn, we'll just say John,\nJohn couldn't screw a light bulb\ninto a light fixture, right?\nThey were just so debilitated\nthey couldn't do simple tasks,\nwhat we call activities of daily living.\nAnd they were coming back\nand having these really\ndramatic improvements\nin all aspects of life.\nAnd so, you know,\nwe have over the last\ncouple of years been able\nto do this first in human,\nkind of full neurobiological clinical\nneurocognitive evaluation\nof what ibogaine is doing.\nIn this case, in special operations,\nspecial forces individuals,\nformer Navy SEALs,\nformer Army Rangers, that\nkind of crew of folks,\nand look at the pre-post changes\nthat their experience to be able\nto totally quantitate all of that.\nAnd so we've been able to\ncapture all the clinical scales,\nyou know, depression scales, PTSD scales,\nall that standard stuff,\nneurocognitive batteries.\nSo how does your executive\nfunction work specifically?\nHow does your verbal memory, all of that?\nAnd then neuroimaging and EEG.\nSo this will be the first human\nstudy of ibogaine for those.\nAnd the reason why is because\nibogaine is kind of the...\nBoth seemingly the most potent\nand most seemingly, to me at least,\nmost powerful psychedelic,\nbut the one that has the most risk too,\nbecause it has a cardiac effect.\nIt seems to be that you\ncan screen people out\nthat have risk off of\ntheir electrocardiogram\nand reduce the risk quite a bit.\nAnd that's what we all did.\nBut that's why people haven't\nreally studied it as much.\nAnd it isn't as, in addition,\nnobody goes to a rave on ibogaine.\nThere's no recreation at all with this.\n- It's not fun.\n- It's, people say that it's relieving,\nbut it's hard work, right?\nBecause yeah, you're reexamining things.\nAnd you know, and so then\nwe see these folks after,\nand I'll tell you, you know,\nwe haven't fully analyzed the data yet,\nbut I'll tell you that, you know,\nfrom what my folks are telling\nme, it's pretty dramatic.\nYou know, people come back and\nthey're doing a lot better.\nThey're doing a lot better.\nAnd nobody, I'll knock on wood,\nnobody's had any sort\nof cardiac issue at all\nin the cohort that we've studied\nand they look a lot better and\nthey feel a lot better too.\nAnd they describe these experiences\nof being able to go back\nthrough and, you know,\nsoldiers experienced something\ncalled moral injury, right?\nWhere maybe they accidentally\nblew something up\nand had a kid in it or\nsomething like that.\nYou know, if they're in Afghanistan, Iraq,\nmaybe, you know, a child died on accident\nor maybe a civilian died\nor whatever it was, right?\nAnd they suffer these moral\ninjuries as part of the job.\nAnd it's almost one of the\nkind of vocational risks.\nThey come back and say that\nthey've forgiven themselves,\nyou know, which is huge, right?\nAnd part of that is being\nable to see themselves\nin a different light and\nhaving empathy finally\nfor themselves and being able\nto kind of have that\nexperience of forgiving.\nAnd so, very cool.\nThe study, you know,\nwhat was happening was\nthey were taking ibogaine\nand then taking something\ncalled 5-MeO-DMT.\nPeople call it the Toad,\nit's the Sonoran River Toad.\nI think it's like you\ncan find these in Mexico,\nfind 'em in Arizona.\nIn the back of the toad produces\nsomething called 5-MeO-DMT,\nwhich is a flavor of DMT\nthat produces a particular\npsychedelic effect\nalso used as a sacrament.\n- Is it dimethyltryptamine?\n- It is a 5-MeO dimethyltryptamine.\nSo it's a kind of a dimethyltryptamine\nwith a kind of addition to it.\nThe deal there is that it lasts\nlonger than traditional DMT.\nYou know, it's like 20\nminutes to five, three,\nor whatever kind of thing.\nAnd so these guys were taking ibogaine\nand then they would take\nthe 5-MeO-DMT after.\nWe had to kind of divorce those two things\nto be able to do the study\nand just understand what\nthe ibogaine was doing.\nAnd they'd go back down a month later\nand they'll do the 5-MeO-DMT.\n- So two completely separate sessions.\n- [Nolan] Two completely\nseparate sessions.\n- And then one quick\nquestion about ibogaine\nbefore a bit more on 5-MeO-DMT.\nIs the ibogaine journey guided,\nor the person just closes their eyes\nand they just start falling\ninto the back catalog of memories?\n- They have a bunch of\npreparatory sessions,\nand then they have a\nbunch of sessions after\nthat they're able to\nkind of rehash things.\nDuring, there's a sitter that sits there\nand kind of sits with\nthem and helps them out,\nbut it's not, it's pretty, the\nphenomenon of the drug seems\nto drive a lot of this, right?\nAnd so a lot of it ends up being\nwhat we call supportive psychotherapy.\nYou're just kind of being there\nand, you know, maybe you're\nholding the person's hand,\nmaybe you're just saying \"I'm here,\"\nor maybe whatever it is,\nbut you're making sure\nthey know you're around.\nBut there's not really\nan interaction per se.\nAnd then the whole kind\nof goal there is just\nto get folks to kind go back through\nand reexamine these memories\nand ultimately look like\nthey reconsolidate them.\nAnd you know, it's very interesting.\nI mean, there's this kind\nof, as you said earlier,\nTimothy Leary kind of\nsociocultural construct\nthat ends up being\noverlaid over psychedelics.\nAnd what I think is\nthat if you rid yourself\nof all of those preconceived notions\nof what it is and isn't,\nand the counterculture movement,\nall that stuff that neither\nof us were ever involved in,\nneither of us are ever\npartake in, you know,\nas kind of straight scientists\nlooking at this, right?\nIf you can kind of rid yourself\nof all those sociocultural constructions\nand then reexamine this,\nif we just discovered these today,\nwe would say that these sorts of drugs are\na huge breakthrough in psychiatry\nbecause they allow for us to do a lot\nof the sorts of things we've\nbeen thinking about with SSRIs,\nwith psychotherapy, but\nkind of combined, right?\nPsychotherapy plus drugs\nin a substance that kind of allows you\nto reexamine these things.\nAnd so it's interesting.\nThere's a lot to do to try\nto figure out if that's true,\nyou know?\nAnd I can say that as it stands right now,\nwe don't know if that\nstatement is true, right?\nThere's a lot more work\nthat needs to happen\nfor that statement to\nbe proven to be true.\nBut the hypothesis is, if it is true,\nthen it's very likely\nthat this will be seen\nas a breakthrough because it allows you\nto do these sorts of\nthings that you can't do\nwith normal waking consciousness.\nBut also why we have to\nreally think about this.\nAnd, you know, these drugs\ncan't be recreational drugs.\nThey really shouldn't be\nrecreational drugs, right?\nThey're really too powerful to be used\nin the context of recreation\nbecause they can put\nyou into these states.\nAnd this generation of\npsychedelic researchers are\nreally clear about that.\nYou know, I think the '60s\nfolks were not clear about that,\nand they felt like there\nwas this whole kind\nof cultural thing that was going on there.\nBut I think this cohort of\nindividuals really understands\nthat in order to really make this happen,\nwe have to understand\nthat if you need a\nprescription for an SSRI,\nwhich doesn't change your\nconsciousness a whole lot,\nand we're very worried about that,\nand the doctor has to evaluate\nyou for that every week,\nthat the idea that some of these\nsubstances would go outside\nof very strict medical supervision is\nkind of preposterous actually.\nIt's kind of a dumb moment, I think,\nfor all of medicine to say,\nlook, if we're going to do this right,\nwe've got to do it such a\nway that's so protected,\nthat's so safe, that we\nmake sure people know\nthese things are not recreational\nand they're really for the pure purposes\nof really powerfully changing\ncognition for a while\nand letting people have these\nwhat seem to be, you know,\nrelatively therapeutic states.\n- I think it's great that\nyou're doing this study.\nAnd along the lines of the\nsort of the early iterations\nof psychedelics and the\ncounterculture of the '60s and '70s,\nsome of which took place,\nlike \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\"\nI think is actually based\non the Menlo Park VA,\nwhich is in our neighborhood of Stanford.\nAnd things are quite a bit different now.\nI know you and I have spent\nsome time with the operators\nand former operators at an event,\nand last Veterans Day, in fact,\nthe so-called Veteran Solutions group\nthat's pioneering a lot of\nthese psychedelic treatments\nfor former special operators\nand current special operators.\nAnd what's interesting to me about that is\nin contrast to the counterculture movement\nof the '60s and '70s, that\nroom was filled with people\nthat are very much of a\nstructure, the military.\nRight?\nSo it's no longer considered\nleft wing, right wing,\nanti-military, pro-military.\nHere this isn't just\nabout one group of people\nwho's exploring\npsychedelics as a treatment\nfor trauma and PTSD and other things.\nAnd of course you also have other domains\nof society looking at this.\nAnd in fact, there were, but\nit was really interesting\nbecause there were both far\nleft and far right politicians\nat that event up on stage together,\ntalking about, in kind of\nlighter terms, heart medicine,\nbut also talking about\nneurobiology and talking.\nIt was just fascinating\nfrom the perspective\nof somebody who's trying\nto learn about this stuff,\nthat psychedelic therapies no longer sit\nwithin the anti-establishment realm.\nIt's independent of all that,\ncertainly when people in\nthe military are adopting it\nas a potential treatment.\nAgain, still under exploration,\nbut also under exploration\nat universities like Stanford\nand Johns Hopkins and UCSF\nand University College London\nand on and on.\nAlong the lines of tree\nbarks and toad skins,\ntell me about ayahuasca.\nAnd as a plant, you know, it's intriguing.\nAnd is it pro-serotonergic\ndrug like psilocybin?\nAnd is it useful for the\nsame sorts of conditions\nthat we've talked about thus far?\nAnd if you could perhaps\ntell me a little bit also\nabout the Brazilian prisoner study.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nDefinitely.\nAyahuasca is another psychedelic.\nIt's used as a sacrament\nin Brazil and in Peru\nand Ecuador, in Columbia.\nSo a lot of the South American countries.\nAnd what they do is they\ncombine two plants together,\nwhere one plant of the\ntwo plant combination\nwould effectively do nothing,\nbut the two plant combination\ntogether is capable\nof producing this very\nprofound psychedelic effect.\nAnd what's really kind of\ncurious is that there are,\nas I understand it,\n10 to 20,000 plant species in the Amazon.\nAnd somehow, somebody-\n- Someone tried 'em all.\n- Combined these two plants together\nin certain proportionality\nand cooked this for five, 10 hours\nto the point where you cook\nout the dimethyltryptamine\nout of one of the plants\nand cook out the reversible\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor\nout of the other plant in such a way\nthat the reversible monoamine\noxidase inhibitor prevents\nthe GI breakdown of the dimethyltryptamine\nin such a way that it's then allowed\nto cross the blood-brain\nbarrier and get into the brain.\nAnd if you didn't add\nthe reversible monoamine\noxidase inhibitor plant derived\ninto this combination,\nthen it would never cross the brain.\nIf you put people on a standard,\npsychiatry prescribed\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor\nthat wasn't reversible,\nyou'd throw them into\nserotonin syndrome, right?\nSo this kind of like sweet spot\nthat somehow ayahuasca\npractitioners have found\nof being able to get DMT into\nthe brain from an oral source\nwith this combination of a\nmonoamine oxidase inhibitor\nis curious.\nAnd so that substance has been explored\nas an antidepressant agent,\nand some studies have looked at that.\nIt also seems to be very safe.\nThere's a psychiatrist down at UCLA Harbor\nwho's done a lot of work with this,\nwhere he's looked at children even\nthat have been exposed to kind\nof small doses of ayahuasca\nas kind of a sacrament\nwithin Amazonian tribes\nand found no neurocognitive effects,\nno neurocognitive effects in adults.\nAnd so it appears to be safe.\nIt's kind of part and brought\ninto various religions,\nincluding kind of merged with\nCatholicism in South America,\nwhich is kind of very interesting.\nAnd so, you know, in some\nsects of Catholicism in Brazil,\nit's used as a sacrament\nduring religious ceremonies.\nAnd so it became interesting\nto Brazilian researchers\nas to whether or not they\ncould affect recidivism rates\nfor prisoners in Brazilian prisons, right?\nSo they gave half of\nthe prisoners, you know,\nsome sort of inert substance\nand half of the prisoners\nan ayahuasca session.\nAnd the recidivism rate or\nthe return to prison rate\nin the ayahuasca exposed individuals was\nstatistically significantly\nlower than the recidivism rate\nin the control group,\nsuggesting that, you know,\nwhatever is going on there\nseems to have an effect\non whatever drives criminal behavior,\nwhatever criminal behavior\nthat happened to be.\nAnd I don't have the details\non the exact nature of the crime.\nYou know, I am also in no way saying\nthat we should just be giving psychedelics\nto folks in prison and all of that.\nI think that that is a\nvery edgy thing to do\nand probably not something\nthat anybody should try,\nbut it does kind of bring\nup this curious question\nof what is it about that\nthat would drive people\nto change those behaviors\nand why do people make\nthose behavioral decisions?\nAnd a lot of times\nif you look at prisons\nin the United States,\nyou know, people say this,\nwhat's the biggest mental health facility\nin the United States?\nIt's a prison.\n- Yeah, there's a lot to\nunpack there for sure.\nYou know, the homeless\nissue, the prison issue.\nIt does lead to something\nthat I heard recently,\nwhich is related to all\nthis, which is cannabis.\nYou know, we hear a lot\nnowadays about people will say,\nwell, it's safer than alcohol.\nAnd we did an episode on alcohol that,\nat least by my read of the literature,\nindeed alcohol does seem to be quite bad\nfor our health beyond...\nI think it's pretty clear\nthat not drinking is better\nfor your health than drinking at all.\nAnd here, I'm not trying\nto tell people what to do,\nbut those are what the data say.\nAnd forget the studies on red wine.\nYou'd have to drink so much red wine\nto get enough resveratrol.\nIt's not even clear resveratrol\ndoes anything useful anyway,\net cetera, et cetera.\nNonetheless, cannabis is now available\nin a lot of very high potency forms.\nPeople are vaping cannabis,\npeople are smoking cannabis.\nI certainly am not saying\nthat cannabis is bad\nfor people necessarily,\nalthough I think children,\nI would hope\nthat their brain development\nwould be completed first,\nyou know, get to age 25.\nI know that sounds late\nfor a lot of people,\nbut the THC obviously taps\ninto some endogenous systems\nand the cannabinoid\nsystems and is powerful.\nAnd I've seen this report\nthat was in Lancet Psychiatry\nthis last year that said that\nearly use of potent cannabis,\nmeaning age 14 to 20 or so,\ncan potentially lead to an exacerbation\nof psychosis later in life.\nAnd I actually put this\nout on social media\nand it sort of exploded.\nI didn't expect it to.\nAnd people were saying,\nwell, that's not causal.\nAnd obviously it's not causal\nbecause people say, well,\nmaybe people with psychotic tendencies\nare seeking out cannabis.\nAlthough that's sort of a weak argument\nin the sense that there's\nat least a 4X increase\nin these psychotic episodes\nfor people later in life.\nBut what are your thoughts about cannabis?\nBecause I do want to acknowledge\nthat it does have medical\nbenefits for certain things,\npain, chemotherapy.\nSo by no means trying to knock on cannabis\nand its appropriate medicinal use.\nBut what should we think about cannabis\nin terms of this finding\nthat it can exacerbate a\npsychosis in certain individuals?\n- Yeah, so I think, you know,\nthere's a couple of things, right?\nSo cannabis is multiple\ncannibinoids, right?\n- Right, THC, CBD, CBN,\nsativas, and, you know, indicas,\nit gets, yeah, there's\na lot there to unpack.\n- Yeah, there's a lot.\nBut there are two main kind\nof chemicals you think about\nand kind of how things are\nessentially bred, right?\nAnd so, you know,\nthere's a lot of cannabis\nthat's really bred to be\nvery high, very potent THC.\nAnd there's cannabis where\nthe THC's bred completely out.\nSo there's stories, you\nknow, from Colorado, right?\nThis strain of cannabis that's THC free,\nthere's no THC at all, and it's all CBD,\nand it's called Charlotte's Web.\nAnd a bunch of kids' parents, one kid,\nand then kind of a string\nof parents after that moved\nto Colorado when cannabis was legalized,\nbecause CBD is antiepileptic,\nso CBD is also antipsychotic.\nAnd so there have been a number of studies\nthat if you give CBD at high doses,\nit's antipsychotic in established\nschizophrenic patients.\nThe issue is\nthat we've bred CBD out of\nmarijuana selectively over time.\nWe've gotten very good\nat figuring out how to do that, right?\nConversely, THC is pro psychotic\nand pro epileptic, right?\nAnd so when you talk about\ndoes cannabis cause psychosis\nor does cannabis treat psychosis,\nit appears to be more related\nto the proportions of CBD to THC\nthan it does to the kind\nof idea of cannabis.\nSo for me,\nand I have no stock in\nthis or anything like that,\nbut there's a company\ncalled GW Pharmaceuticals,\nand I haven't looked into them in a while,\nbut they have a lot of clinical trials\nfor something called Dravet Syndrome,\nwhich is a seizure disorder\nwhere kids seize a whole lot,\nLennox-Gastaut syndrome,\nwhich is a seizure disorder,\nkids are seizing 300 times a day.\nBoth of these are like\nkids are seizing so much,\nthey're basically in a seizure\nor in the postictal phase constantly.\nAnd they've failed everything.\nThey've failed barbiturates,\nthey've failed bromides,\nwhich we just don't use\nanymore except in these cases\nbecause of the side effects.\nAnd they'll give kids CBD.\nAnd I think CBD is a pretty safe drug\ncompared to bromide, right?\nAnd so this idea that CBD\nin a kid is actually safe,\nit's a cannabinoid, but it's\nCBD and it's safe, right?\nAnd so that to me is totally fine.\nAlso giving CBD as an adjunctive treatment\nfor schizophrenia.\nThere have been some positive trials\nand negative trials in that,\nbut there seems to be no\nnegative side effects.\nIt seems to reduce some of\nthe metabolic syndrome issues\nin folks with schizophrenia\nwho are having side effects\nfrom the primary antipsychotic.\nThe converse is, there's\nclearly cases where people\nthat are taking very high\ndoses of THC become psychotic,\nthey get put into the\npsychiatric unit, nothing happens\nother than they kind of get\nthe THC out of their system,\nand then they resolve\ntheir psychosis, right?\nAnd so that, and you know,\na handful of people who have had seizures\nrelated to high doses of THC and syncope\nand all sorts of things.\nAnd so this idea that THC,\nhigh doses of THC can be pro psychotic,\nis also not taking a shot at people\nthat think that cannabis\noverall is a good thing.\nIt's just, it just is what it is.\nAnd the kind of pure, I\nthink if you zoom back\nand you say you're a true naturalist,\nyou're thinking about natural\nmedicines in the world,\nyou should think, well,\nprobably marijuana was\nbalanced THC CBD at some point,\nand then we humans messed with it, right?\nAnd that most likely, that was\nprobably okay at some level,\nand then we pushed it one way or another.\nAnd what I mean by okay\nis in a 45 year old,\nit's okay, kind of thing.\nNow, what I think is\ngoing on with the kids,\nwith the teenagers,\nis you've got prefrontal\nmaturation, right?\nAnd then you're exposing them\nto a whole lot of high THC load.\nAnd while it's unclear\nif it's cause or effect,\nit's certainly in the picture.\nAnd if I were a parent,\nI wouldn't want my 16 year\nold smoking marijuana.\nIf I were a parent and my 30\nyear old, otherwise healthy,\ntotally fine, you know, whatever,\nbanker, lawyer kid decided\nto try marijuana for the first time,\nI wouldn't scold them about it, right?\nSo I think it's this kind\nof a different thing, right?\nI would never want my up to 25 year old,\njust like you're saying,\nbefore prefrontal maturation,\nI would never want my\nkid to be exposed at all.\nBut it looks like, except\nin susceptible individuals\nthat are susceptible to\ndrug-induced psychosis,\nit looks like, you know,\nit's a relatively safe thing\npast prefrontal maturation.\nYou know, again, I'm not going\nto comment of cause and effect,\nbut I would say that, you\nknow, if you're a parent,\nit doesn't make much sense, right?\nYou never know what's ultimately\ngoing to hurt your kid.\nI mean, we were talking\nabout this earlier,\nmy wife's pregnant now.\nShe kind of avoids everything, right?\nRightfully so, right?\nThis idea that we just,\nwe want to be careful\nwhen our children's brains are developing.\nAnd I think that's really\nwhat you were saying\nand I think actually important.\nThe bigger question that you asked,\nwhich is relative risks of\ndrugs, is an interesting one.\nSo David Nutt published in, I\nthink it was in \"The Lancet,\"\nI'll have to look it up,\nbut I think in \"The Lancet,\"\nan article about relative drug risks\nfor the person and for society.\nAnd this was like,\nhe was on the UK's like\nBritish Drug Policy Group,\nwhere essentially what he showed was\nif you look at societal\nrisk plus personal risk,\nand you combine those two,\nyou know what drug is the most\ndangerous drug in the world?\n- I'm going to guess it's alcohol.\n- It's alcohol,\nright behind heroin and\ncocaine and da da da da da,\nand somewhere in the middle is marijuana.\nAnd right on the tail end,\non the exact other end\nof this, psilocybin.\n- Is caffeine, usually\ndoesn't make the list.\n- It may have been on the list.\nIf it was, it was probably\npretty close to psilocybin,\nbut somewhere in the middle was ketamine,\nsomewhere in the middle was amphetamine,\nsomewhere in the, you know,\na little closer to psilocybin,\nI think was MDMA, you know.\nBut it's this combined\npersonal kind of world risk\nof these things.\nAnd so alcohol makes it,\nbecause there's a huge\namount of personal risk\nand there's a huge amount\nof societal risk, right?\nDrunk drivers kill X amount\nof people in the world.\n- Fight, sexual assault, all that.\n- All that, yeah.\nAnd then all the cancer\nand all that stuff.\nAnd so it beats out cocaine,\nit beats out heroin,\nit beats out all of these things.\nAnd yet, we don't, as a\nculture, for whatever reason,\nwe don't as a culture see it as a drug.\nAnd that's the part that\nreally baffles me, you know?\n- I mean, they serve it.\nI mean, this is no knock\non Stanford at all.\nOf course, I wouldn't do that.\nThis is at every institution I've been to,\nthey serve alcohol at the\ngraduate student events.\n- [Nolan] That's right.\n- You know, they serve alcohol.\nThey do a happy hour.\nI've never been a drinker.\nI can take it or leave it.\n- [Nolan] Yeah, same.\n- And I realize that some people,\nthey really enjoy alcohol.\nYou know, my former partner, I mean,\nshe just was in that 10% or so of people\nwho have a glass of wine\nand just feel great.\nAnd the second one, feel great.\nI just want to take a nap\nafter I have a bit of alcohol,\nso it never does much for me.\nI always feel poisoned.\nI feel lucky in that sense.\nBut it's unbelievable\nthat it is so prevalent\nand it's just, it's\nbaked into the medical,\neven medical institutions,\nthey'll pop a bottle of champagne\nto celebrate the opening of a hospital.\n- [Nolan] That's right, that's right.\n- You know, that's pretty crazy.\n- Yeah, no, you're absolutely right.\nYou know, I think what's going to happen,\nbut this is me, you know,\nlooking at the crystal ball a little bit,\nbut I think what's going to happen is\nwhat happened with doctors and smoking.\nSo if you look at the\n'50s and '60s, right?\nThere are all these pictures\nof doctors smoking cigarettes,\nyou know, with patients or, you know,\npsychiatrists doing psychotherapy\nand smoking a cigarette\nwith the patient sitting on the couch,\nyou know, surgeons smoking a\ncigarette in between cases,\nthere are all these\npictures of that, right?\nAnd now all of a sudden,\nsmoking's totally banned.\nI think it's totally banned\nfrom most of Stanford campus.\nMy suspicion is, as\nyou're suggesting, right?\nYou know, this is everywhere\nand it's all kind of ubiquitous.\nAt some critical point,\nsome tipping point,\neverybody's going to realize\nthat, just like with smoking,\nwe've got to rid hospital systems\nand universities of alcohol.\nAnd at some point in 50 years,\nit's my view that we'll look\nit back at these scenarios\nthat you're talking about\nand be like, you know what,\nwe were foolish about this.\nI can't believe that\nwe gave people alcohol\nwhen they graduated\nfrom whatever, you know?\nAnd I think we'll have\na different take on it,\nbut it's going to take a longer time.\nI think people did a really\ngood job tying smoking\nto lung cancer and it's like\na very simplistic story.\nSmoking, lung cancer, you know?\nNow, as you know,\nalcohol increases the risk of\na lot of different cancers.\nNot so clear which one.\nI mean, there's like, you\nknow, the kind of oral,\nlike the throat, tongue\ncancer, that's one of-\n- Breast cancer.\n- Yeah, breast cancer, you know?\nAnd so it's kind of just,\nit's a harder story to tell,\nyou know?\nAnd I think that's why, and everybody,\nyou know, and then there's this whole,\nit's, you know, my mom says this.\nIt's like I drank my glass of wine\nbecause my doctor told\nme it was heart healthy.\nAnd we were talking\nabout this, and I try to,\nno, no, no, but Dr. So-and-so\nsaid it's heart healthy.\nAnd so it ends up being this thing\nwhere like she's drinking\nalcohol because she thinks\nthat it's good for her heart.\nAnd, you know, and it's hard.\nI've had those conversations with her.\nIt's hard to untie that.\nAnd I think that, yeah,\nat some point we're going to\nhit some threshold moment.\nAnd it'll be interesting if\nwe really look at the data\nand we really look at\nwhat's safe and not safe\npurely from this analysis,\nit kind of points to the right direction.\n- It's really interesting.\nAnd also say nothing of poor judgment\nunder the influence of alcohol.\nI mean, I would venture\nthat if we were to remove\nalcohol from university campuses,\nwatch, the students are\ngoing to lobby against me\nif I say this.\nBut if you were to remove\nalcohol from campuses,\nI mean, just think about\nwhat I suspect would be\nthe improvement in good decision making.\nAnd that would occur.\nOr, you know, I've got stories\nfrom graduate school and...\nIt was very different,\nyou know, 10 years ago.\nThere was a lot more alcohol consumption.\nAgain, that was never my thing,\nbut I know people who\nmake really bad decisions.\nIn any case, there's a whole\nlandscape there emerging.\nI think you got your finger\nright on the pulse of it.\nI want to touch on\nsomething slightly different\nthan what we've been talking about,\nbut definitely related to depression.\nAnd this, again,\nis one of these intriguing\nbut perplexing things,\nwhich is that sleep deprivation\ncan improve symptoms\nof depression.\nAnd yet I'm personally\nvery familiar with the fact\nthat if I don't sleep well for one night\nor don't sleep at all, in fact,\nI do have an ability to function\npretty well the next day.\nI'll do this non-sleep deep rest practice\nthat I blab a lot about on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhich for me is tremendously restorative,\nbut I like a good night's sleep.\nI think everybody understands now,\nthanks to the great work of Matthew Walker\nand others that have really\ngotten out into the world\nsaying, look, the\nfoundation of mental health,\nphysical health, and high\nperformance, if that's your thing,\nbeing a functional human being,\nis to try and get enough\nquality deep sleep\nat least 80% of the nights\nof your life, if you can.\nThat's something to focus on.\nJust like good nutrition,\njust like exercise and\nsocial connection, et cetera.\nSo sleep deprivation,\nwe know, in particular,\nI think rapid eye movement\ncomponents of sleep deprivation\ncan improve the symptoms of depression.\nAnd yet being sleep deprived\ncan also really disregulate\nour control of the autonomic system.\nI notice on night two or\nnight three of poor sleep,\nif I'm going through a stressful\nphase and that's happening,\nall of a sudden my heart\nrate is chronically elevated,\nmy thought patterns\nbecome really disrupted.\nI can't then exercise, my\ndecision making is thrown off,\nmy emotionality is more labile.\nThe hinge, as we were\nreferring to it earlier,\nfeels less in control, under my control.\nAnd maybe I wonder sometimes\nif I enter that state\nthat you refer to earlier,\nwhere the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex is\nno longer leading the cingulate,\nbut the cingulate is now in charge.\nThe players are in charge of the coach.\nNot a good situation.\nSo I know you've done some\nwork on sleep deprivation\nand light and effects.\nPlease tell us about that\nand please tell us about\nthis triple therapy.\nIs that?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo friend of mine, Greg Salem,\nanother one of the professors at Stanford,\nwas very interested in sleep.\nHe did a bunch of training in sleep\nbefore he went to medical school\nand got very interested in this\nidea that, as you're saying,\nif you sleep deprive somebody one night\nin just kind of an isolated single night,\nat the end of that sleep deprivation,\nthey will have an antidepressant effect,\nbut as soon as they fall\nasleep, they lose it.\nSo if it's a depressed individual,\nyou can get them to be\nless depressed acutely.\nSoon as they fall asleep, they\nwake up eight hours later,\nthen they come back into the\nsame level of depression.\nAnd so the idea is that you needed\nto do some sort of circadian reset.\nAnd that part of what depression is,\nis that it's a dysregulated\ncircadian system.\nAnd so mentors of mine say,\nif you can just get the sleep better,\nthat's half the battle of\ndealing with depression.\n'Cause so many people have\ninsomnia around depression\nand have a whole host\nof types of insomnia.\nHaving a hard time falling asleep,\nwaking up in the middle of the\nnight, and waking up earlier,\nall symptoms of depression.\nAnd so what this does is it\nsleep deprives the individual\nand then there's a certain calculation\nof shifting their phase\nand simultaneously exposing\nthem to bright lights.\nSo that's the triple, the phase shift,\nthe sleep deprivation,\nand the bright light,\nto try to get their circadian rhythm.\nEssentially the theory is reintrained.\nAnd so, you know, in the\ntrials that we've done\nand other trials prior to\nours and after, you know,\nit looked like there was\na pretty profound antidepressant effect\nfrom this triple therapy\nthat seemed to be durable,\nmeaning durability is this term we use\nto say that not only can you\nget kind of point relief,\nbut that the relief ends\nup, you know, lasting.\nWhat's important to\nknow about this is like,\nyou shouldn't do this at home for sure.\nYou would need to do\nthis with a professional,\n'cause it's complicated,\nit's not just one thing.\nAnd sleep deprivation,\nwhile it seems to be\nantidepressant, it's pro anxiety.\nSo if you take a highly anxious\nperson that's not depressed\nand you sleep deprive them,\nthey get profoundly anxious.\nAnd so that's the other thing\nthat you have to really realize is\nthat this is like everything else\nthat I've talked about today,\nall things that you have to\ndo under medical supervision,\nbut curious, right?\nAnd I think, you know, the\nquestion that always comes up is\nwhy isn't this used more?\nAnd I think the reason is\nthat there's not really a\nmechanism for, you know,\nultimately in medicine, as sad as it is,\nyou have to have a code to do a thing.\nThere has to be a code\nassociated with a treatment\nand it's hard to figure out\nhow to make a code for this.\nAnd so I think that's part of it.\nAnd so if there's a way,\nand somebody's got to kind\nof take that baton on that,\nbut if there's a way to\nmake a code for this,\nyou know, I think you could\nactually turn it into something\nthat was more widely utilized.\nAnd, you know, probably dream up ways\nof how to integrate AI, passive sensing,\nall that stuff to really make that work.\nBut I think that would be the idea,\nthat would be the trajectory\nI'd see, so, yeah.\n- Yeah, having a billable to\ninsurance code is fundamental.\nAnd a lot of listeners to this podcast,\nI think, have a background\nin engineering science.\nAnd we will put a link to that manuscript\nthat talks about the triple therapy,\nbecause here we're talking\nabout one night sleep deprivation,\nsome timed light exposure to the eyes,\nand then shifting in the\ncircadian clock being central\nto the themes of the\npodcast that come up often.\nI think for the typical person,\ncan we say that trying to get\na regular light dark cycle\nat sleep rhythm would be beneficial\nfor overall mood regulation?\n- Yeah, I think for the\ntypical person, you know,\nreally kind of reregulating your sleep\nand trying to get, you\nknow, a good night's sleep\nin which you fall asleep, stay asleep,\nwake up at a set time every\nmorning is going to be\npretty crucial.\nYou know, in mild depression,\nI think that one has a\nlot of control over that.\nAs we were talking about earlier,\nI think when you hit some\nthreshold in depression\nwhere things become\nkind of semi-volitional\nand it's harder to kind of\nwill yourself into that.\nThere are therapies like, you know,\nthere's a CBT for insomnia, for instance,\nwhere you can do cognitive\nbehavioral therapy\nto help with insomnia.\nSometimes people, and I'm no sleep expert.\nKind of pass this to Greg\nto fully talk about this,\nbut some of what goes on\nthat people with kind of\nmilder insomnia experience is\nlike blue light out of their\ncomputer and things like that,\nso you can use like\nblue light blockers to,\nit tricks your brain, as\nyou know better than me,\nit tricks your brain to think\nthat it's still light outside.\nAnd so people will still have insomnia\nbecause their brain still\nthinks that it's light outside.\nAnd then people will, you know,\nthe kind of strict CBT for sleep.\nYou know, therapists will\nsay there are only two things\nthat you should do in your bed.\nAnd if you're under a\ncertain age and whatnot,\nit's really one thing that\nyou should do in your bed,\nwhich is to sleep and be\nwith your partner, right?\nAnd so those are kind of the two things\nthat you should do in a bedroom.\nAnd that's really the only things\nthat you should do in a bedroom\nif you're having sleep problems.\nYou shouldn't watch TV in a bedroom,\nyou shouldn't eat in a\nbedroom, shouldn't hang out.\n- Keep the phone out of the bedroom.\n- [Nolan] Keep the phone\nout of the bedroom, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nWe should get Greg Salem on the podcast.\nI'll just mention\nfor people that want to\nregulate their sleep,\nwe have a sleep toolkit that's available\nas a downloadable PDF at hubermanlab.com.\nJust go to the menu\nand a lot of the things\nin that toolkit are based on work\nfrom Stanford Sleep Laboratories,\nincluding Jamie Zeitz and others' lab,\nnot aimed at depression specifically.\nListen, Nolan, Dr. Williams,\nthis has been an amazing voyage\nthrough the circuitry\nof autonomic control.\nThis landscape of the\nprefrontal cortex is,\nI find incredibly fascinating\nand I just want to start off\nby saying please do come back again\nand teach us more about\nthat and your TMS work.\nBefore we wrap, however,\nI do want to give you the opportunity\nto talk about the SAINT study.\n- [Nolan] Yeah, definitely.\n- Is it SAINT or SAINTS plural?\n- Yeah, it's SAINT.\nSo SAINT, or we're calling it SNT now.\nSAINT has, you know...\nThe intent was not to kind\nof connect it to religion,\nbut we may have accidentally done so.\nAnd so we abbreviated it to SNT\nfor the subsequent trials,\nwhich was initially\nStanford Accelerated Intelligent\nNeuromodulation Therapy,\nor now what we're calling\nStanford Neuromodulation Therapy.\nBut the idea there, which is a cool idea,\nis that TMS is a device\nthat delivers a treatment,\nand the treatment is the protocol.\nAnd the protocol is the\nstimulation parameter set\nin a specific brain region\nfor a specific condition.\nAnd so what's cool about neuromodulation,\nwhether it be transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation\nor transcranial direct current stimulation\nor deep brain stimulation,\nlike what Casey Halpern talked\nabout on another podcast,\nis this idea that in all of those cases,\nthe device itself is a\nphysical layer conduit\nof a stimulation protocol\nthat's therapeutic\nfor a given condition\nin a given brain region.\nAnd so in the case of depression,\nwhich we know the most about for with TMS,\nwe've been doing TMS\nstudies for depression for,\nyou know, since 1995, right?\nAnd the clearance in 2000, 2008, 2009.\nAnd in that timeframe,\nwe were able to go from really\nknowing very little at all\nabout how to do something like this\nto getting an FDA clearance.\nAnd the way that it went down was\nthat there were two groups\nstudying different components\nat NIH.\nThe first group was\nstudying mood neuroanatomy\non functional imaging.\nThat was kind of the first generation\nof functional imaging\nback then, so PET scans,\nwhich are kind of metabolic\nscans, and then SPECT scans.\nAnd the idea there was looking\nat activity and metabolism\nand prefrontal cortex.\nAnd what they found in these\nkind of more crude scans is\nthat just general\nhypoactivity, hypometabolism.\nThe other group right upstairs\nat the National Institute\nfor Neurological Diseases\nand Stroke, NINDS, they\nwere looking at using TMS,\nwhich had been around for 10 years,\nand repetitively\nstimulating in motor cortex.\nAnd what they found was, gosh,\nwe can get a readout in thumb\nmuscle movement amplitude\nthat's really reproducible across people.\nIt's like, you know,\nuniversally reproducible.\nAnd if we do certain\nstimulation approaches,\nthey are biologically active\nto either increase excitability,\nIE the thumb motion,\nand a set intensity goes up,\nthe amount of amplitude goes up,\nor inhibitory or depotentiating,\nit goes down with other\nbiological stimulation approaches.\nAnd then a third outcome,\nwhich is important,\nthat it's inert, it doesn't do either.\nSo you can have stimulation\napproaches that do one,\nyou know, increase\nactivity, decrease activity,\nor are inert.\nAnd so what they found was, oh,\nwe can excite certain brain regions.\nThen my mentor, Mark George said,\nhad this kind of aha moment where he said,\n\"Wow, there's underactivity\nin prefrontal cortex\nin depression, and we can\nincrease activity using this thing\nthat we know we can increase\nactivity in motor cortex.\nWe just need to put it\nin the left dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex.\"\nAnd then they combined the two\nand started stimulating once a day\nin this kind of very abbreviated fashion.\nAnd lo and behold,\nsome of those depression patients\nresolved their depression.\nAnd back then, and still today,\nyou can go and as a\npsychiatric patient stay\nat the National Institute of Mental Health\nand go through clinical\ntrials to try to get treated.\nAnd there were patients\nwho'd been there for months\nand they were able to be discharged.\nBecause their mood was better, yeah.\nAnd so just very crude approach\nwhere they were using ruler\nmeasurements where DLPFC was,\nand they were stimulating with devices\nthat you needed to physically\ndunk the coil in an ice bath.\nAnd with that, they still were able to,\nthe kind of genius of\nthis, Mark and others,\nthey would still be able\nto create a purely engineered\nstimulation approach.\nWhat's cool about that is\nthat they kind of found two things, right?\nThey found this one stimulation protocol\nthat does have some antidepressant effect.\nIt's limited, it doesn't treat everybody,\nit does have some antidepressant effect.\nAnd this bigger concept that\na neuromodulation device is\nkind of like a pharmaceutical\ncompany for you, right?\nThat in a given individual,\na TMS device or whatever\nneuromodulation device is able\nto generate, you can create\na stimulation approach\nthat is specific to a given condition\nand specific to an individual.\nAnd so the physical layer\nis just how you exert that,\nsimilarly to how we make\npharmaceutical drugs\nin a pharmaceutical company.\nBut the actual therapy\nitself is what you do,\nwhere you do it.\nAnd so what we learned from, you know,\nanother 20, 30 years of this is\nthat you can modify the\nstimulation protocol in such a way\nwhere you can create a whole new treatment\nand put it through the same TMS device\nor, thank god, an evolved version of it\nwhere you don't have\nto dunk it in ice baths\nand they can actually really handle\nmuch more aggressive\nstimulation approaches.\nAnd so in 2005,\na group published in \"Neuron\"\na paper demonstrating\nthat if you stimulate with\nthe hippocampal rhythms\nthrough a TMS coil,\nyou can excite the brain\nwith memory rhythms\nand it'll last an hour.\nSo you can change cortical excitability\nin the thumb twitch for an hour,\nsending three minutes of excitatory\nor 40 seconds in the case\nof inhibitory stimulation\nthat mimics hippocampal rhythms.\nSo much more efficient than\nthe original TMS approaches.\nAnd so, you know, after\nthat group tried to do it\nin this kind of six week schedule,\nand after that, you know, and\nwhile they were doing that,\nwe decided, gosh, you know,\nthis problem I talked about\nat the beginning of the show\nwhere you have this problem\nthat we don't have a treatment\nfor people who are\nin these high acuity psychiatric\nemergency states, right?\nThis idea that we are going\nto engineer a treatment\nwhere we can reorganize the\nstimulation approach in time\nto be much more efficient\nby utilizing something\ncalled space learning theory.\nAnd so you probably know about\nthe space learning theory.\nSo the idea for the viewers is,\nit's a simple psychological thing,\nbut we've also seen it\nin hippocampal slice\nsort of physiology too, where\nif I'm cramming for a test,\nwhat I do is I write out 60 note cards\nand I read each one for a minute\nuntil I get to the first\nnote card and again,\nand that's about an hour later, right?\nAnd we just intuitively do this.\nWe all, you know, automatically do that.\nAnd we intuit that because we\nknow that what doesn't work is\nwriting out one note card\nand looking at it over and over again.\nNobody ever does that, right?\nYou know, we've all been in\ngraduate school, medical school,\nand we have these big\nstacks of note cards.\nThat's space learning theory.\nIt's this idea that you need\nto see it about every hour\nto an hour and a half and\nthat optimizes learning.\nIf you take the same stimulation approach\nthat I'm talking about,\nthis data burst stimulation approach,\nand you take a hippocampal\nslice of a mouse\nand you stimulate, you\nenlarge some dendritic spines\nand you prime some.\nAnd then if you stimulate\nright after that,\nyou don't get any change.\nIt's called in mass stimulation.\nBut if you wait about an\nhour to an hour and a half,\nyou get more dendritic spines\nenlarged and more primed.\nWhich, by the way, also\nis what ketamine does,\nit causes a dendritic spine enlargement.\nAnd so, you know, what we\nfound was is that the old way\nof doing TMS, this idea of\njust doing it once a day,\nevery day, five days a week for six weeks,\ndidn't utilize the space learning theory.\nIt's like studying for a month or two,\njust a little bit once a day.\nLike you remember some of that stuff,\nbut it's like not as potent as that week\nwhere you're kind of cramming, right?\nAnd what we realized is\nthat if we could reorganize\nthe stimulation in time\nso that we took the whole six week course,\nwe actually figured out\na way to do it in a day.\nAnd then what we also figured out is\nthat people were underdosing TMS\nbecause if you just keep\ngoing after six weeks\nout to month three, four, five,\nmore and more people got better.\nSo we figured out it's not just one day,\nwe're going to give five\ntimes the normal dose.\nWe're going to have 7 1/2\nmonths' worth in five days\nusing space learning theory.\n- So every hour?\n- [Nolan] Every hour for 10 hours.\n- For five days.\n- For five days.\nSo it's a 50 hour block.\nIt's 90 minutes of actual stimulation,\nbut spread out through the day\nin the same way of learning.\nWhich is perfect for an inpatient\npsychiatric unit, right?\n- [Andrew] Five days is manageable.\n- Yeah, you can get stimulation.\nNobody's ever dropped out by the schedule.\nYou know, folks that want\nto do this, want to do it.\nSo they'll do their nine minutes,\nthey'll go get breakfast,\nthey'll do their nine minutes,\nthey'll go see their\ntherapist or whatever it is.\nAnd so what we found\nwith this reorganization\nand time of the stimulation dose,\nand then the third component is\nwe do resting state\nfunctional connectivity scans\non everybody.\nAnd we have ways now in\nthe last five to 10 years\nof picking out that specific\nsubgenual DLPFC subcircuit\nthat I was talking about\nearlier, that cingulate DLPFC,\nwe can pick that out in every single one.\nIf you want to come to the lab,\nwe can find your DLPFC subgenual.\nIt's even more robust than non-\n- Maybe we could stimulate\ntoo, just while we're in there.\n- Yeah, if you want to,\nwe can move around your hypnotizability.\nAnd we can find that spot in each person.\nInstead of finding the\nsame spot on the skull,\nwe find the same spot on the\nbrain, and we can stimulate.\nAnd we do that every hour on the hour.\nAnd what we've found is that folks will,\nwithin one to five days, you\nknow, in more cases than not,\nand depending upon if you're\nlooking at this open label\nor in trials, somewhere\nbetween 60 and 90% of the time,\nthey will go into full on remission\nin the sense they're totally\nnormal from a mood standpoint\nat the end of this.\nAnd like I said, with variable durability.\nSo that's the part we\nhave to figure out now\nabout dosing and how to keep people well.\nBut for some people, you know,\nwe've had four years of remission,\nyou know, year of remission.\nAnd it's really that cramming of the test.\nIt's really that idea that\nyou're laying in that information\nto the exact right spot.\nAnd the signal is a simple\nsignal, but it's a profound one,\nwhich is turn on, stay\non, remember to stay on.\nYou know, that idea that you're\nsending this memory signal\ninto the brain and you're\ndoing it in such a way\nthat you're telling the system,\nyou're kind of taking it out\nof your own hippocampus' hand\nand you're sending the same signal\nthe hippocampus normally signals out.\nNow you're sending that signal\ninto the prefrontal cortex\nand kind of utilizing the\nbrain's own communication style\nto get it to get out of the state.\nAnd what's very cool\nabout this is that people,\nwhen they kind of exit out of that,\nthey end up saying they don't\nhave any side effects from it.\nAnd they feel back to normal.\nLike some people, you know,\nnot everybody, but there's\na subsection of people\nthat with SSRIs where they'll\nsay, I kind of feel numb,\nor I have GI side effects,\nor I can't, you know,\nI don't have the sexual\ninterest that I used to have\nand that sort of thing.\nYou know, not anything against SSRIs,\nas I said earlier, life saving, you know,\nfor a subsection of people,\nthese things really work.\nBut with this, what you see is\nthat people don't talk\nabout any of that stuff.\nAnd I think it's likely\nbecause you're tapping\ninto that core circuitry\nand you're reversing it and\nyou're doing it with a magnet\nthat, because it's a very\nprofound electromagnet,\nit's the same field\nstrength as an MRI scanner,\nit's able to induce a current in the brain\nin this focal targeted way\nwithout getting into\nthe rest of the brain,\nwithout getting into the\nrest of the body at all.\nAnd just really kind of\nacting only on that circuitry\nthat's involved.\n- Incredible.\nIs the SAINT study still ongoing?\nAnd if people are interested\nin potentially being patients\nor subjects in the study, can\nwe provide them a portal link?\n- Absolutely, yeah.\nSo we have, now the treatment,\nsome of my students went over\nto a company called Magnus Medical,\nand they've been working on this,\nthey've got an FDA clearance now.\nAnd now folks can get it through trials\nover the next couple of years\nbecause it's going to take\nsome time for that company\nto kind of get up and\nrunning and get a device\nand get the whole thing set up nationally.\nBut while that's all going on,\nthere's still about 1,000\npatients that need to be recruited\nacross a bunch of different\ntrials all over the country.\nWe'll take people from\nanywhere in the country.\nWe also have partners in\nNew York and San Diego\nand in soon to be South\nCarolina and other places\nwhere we can actually kind of, you know,\nmy lab can help to kind of\nlet people know where to go,\nbased off of where they're at in the US,\nand get them access to\nbeing able to be in a trial.\nAnd what we've tried to do is make it\nso that even if you get\nthe, you know, 50 50 chance,\nyou're going to get the real deal\nor you're going to get the non-real deal.\nBut what we have figured out is a way\nto let everyone have access.\nIf they got the not real deal version,\nthe kind of sham version\nor the fake version,\nfor the first part of the trial,\nthere are other trials\nwhere they can have access\nto the real version.\nSo essentially everybody\neventually gets access\nto having the real version.\nAnd so that's been a big thing for me is\nI want everybody that comes\nthrough one of our trials\nto be able to have access.\nI think it's important.\nWhile the company's\ndoing what they're doing\nand what the lab's doing,\nand kind of nationally what\nother partner labs are doing.\n- Well, I can assure you, you're\ngoing to get some interest.\n- [Nolan] Happy to have it, yeah.\n- Thank you.\nAnd listen,\nthank you so much for taking\nus on this incredible voyage\nthrough the neurocircuitry\nunderlying certain aspects\nof depression,\nthe coverage of the different\ntypes of depression,\nthe various therapeutic\ncompounds, how they work.\nWe've talked about a lot of things today.\nYou've shared so much knowledge,\nand even as I say that,\nI very much want to have you back\nto talk about many other things as well\nthat we didn't have time to cover,\nbut also just really want to thank you\nfor the work that you do.\nI know we are colleagues,\nbut you run an enormous\nlaboratory, enormous in my book.\n40 people is a big group, very big group.\nPlus you're in the clinic,\nyou also have a life of\nyour own outside of work.\nAnd to take the time to sit down with us\nand share all this knowledge\nthat really is in service\nto mental health and human feeling better\nand in fact avoiding\noften suicidal depression.\nIt's just incredible work\nand incredible generosity.\nAnd just thank you so much.\n- Oh, thank you, man.\nI mean, you know, similarly\nI want to thank you\nfor what you're doing.\nI mean, I think that what you, you know,\nI've got a lot of friends,\nfolks that are not in\nthe medical profession,\nfriends of mine, you know,\none of my buddies who's\na real estate agent\nwho works with us, who's a\nbig, big fan of your show.\nAnd you know, I told a\ncouple people like that\nI was coming on and they\nwere like super stoked.\nThey're like, you know,\nwe watch every show\nand, you know, super\nexcited to watch mine.\nAnd they said something very\nimportant to me that, you know,\nyou make this complicated neuroscience\nand kind of brain-body\nscience accessible, you know,\nin a way that few have a gift to do.\nAnd I think that that's so important\nand this show is doing so much\nto help with science literacy.\nAnd yeah, appreciate you, so...\n- Well, thank you.\nI'm gratified and\nhonored by your statement\nand I look forward to more.\nThank you.\n- Absolutely, thank you.\n- Thank you for joining me today\nfor my discussion with Dr. Nolan Williams.\nI hope you found our discussion\nabout psychedelics and other compounds,\nabout transcranial magnetic
