    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are discussing\nfocus and concentration\nand tools for improving your\nfocus and concentration.\nThis is a topic that\nI've covered previously\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut in different contexts.\nFor instance, we had a very\npopular episode on ADHD,\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder,\nwhich of course relates\nto the topic of focus\nand how to improve focus.\nWe've also talked a lot about\ndopamine motivation and drive.\nIn fact, that's the title of your previous\nalso quite popular\nepisode of this podcast,\nbut never before have we had a\nsingle episode solely devoted\nto the tools to improve\nfocus and concentration.\nThe rationale for recording this episode\nis to provide people one\nlocation where they can go\nand quickly access the specific tools\nfor increasing focus and concentration\nthat are known to be\nthe most powerful tools\nand the most up to date tools.\nIn fact, today's episode is\ngoing to include description\nof several peer reviewed studies\nand the tools that emerge\nfrom those scientific\npeer reviewed studies\nthat point to new,\nand fortunately, even briefer protocols\nthan I've described before.\nSo what I'm basically\ndescribing here is tools\nthat in a very short amount of time\nwill allow you to significantly increase\nyour focus and concentration abilities.\nThose tools will include behavioral tools,\nnutrition based tools,\nsupplement based tools,\nbrain machine interface based tools,\nand for those of you that\nare working with a physician,\nprescription drug tools.\nToday's episode ought to benefit anybody,\nyoung or old or anything in between\nwhether or not you have ADHD or not.\nToday's episode is going to give you tools\nthat you can apply in your daily life,\nmost all of them are completely zero cost\nand those tools will allow you\nto tap into the neurochemistry\nand the neurocircuits\nwithin your brain and body\nthat peer-reviewed\nscience has reliably shown\ncan significantly improve\nyour focus and concentration abilities.\nJust to give you a little teaser\nof the kinds of tools that\nI'm going to provide you\non today's episode,\na previous guest on the\nHuberman Lab Podcast\nwas Dr. Wendy Suzuki.\nDr. Suzuki is a professor of\npsychology and neuroscience\nat New York University, or NYU\nas it's commonly referred to.\nShe's also the Dean of\nArts and Sciences at NYU.\nHer laboratory made a\nvery important discovery,\nwhich was that a very brief, just 12,\nactually 13 if you really count the intro,\nbut 13 minute daily meditation\nperformed for a period\nof about eight weeks\nsignificantly increased\npeople's focus and\nconcentration abilities.\nAnd the great news is you\ndidn't need all eight weeks,\nit was just that's how long\nthat you ran the study.\nSo during today's episode,\nI will describe that protocol in detail.\nI'll also provide you an even briefer\nalternative to that\nprotocol that you can use,\nif for instance, you find yourself\nwith only three minutes or four minutes\nor five minutes a day to meditate.\nThe great news is there's\nquality peer reviewed science\nto support that form of meditation\nfor improving focus and concentration.\nAnd that falls under the\nbin of these zero cost tools\nthat you can really use to\ntap into the neurochemistry\nand neurocircuits that really allow you\nto take control of your\ncognitive abilities\nand improve them over time.\nI'll also provide you important details\nabout that protocol and other protocols.\nFor instance,\ncontrary to popular belief, it is not,\nI repeat it is not a good idea\nto do a focused based meditation\nwithin the four hours before bedtime.\nMany people,\nincluding some of the\nsubjects in that study\nperformed by the Suzuki lab,\nfound that when they did a\nfocusing meditation protocol,\neven if it was very calming,\nit led to difficulties in\nfalling and staying asleep.\nSo that runs counter to\na lot of what we've heard\nabout meditation being great for sleep.\nIt turns out meditation\nmight be great for sleep,\nit certainly is great for\nimproving focus capacity,\nbut I highly recommend that\nif you're going to apply\na focus meditation tool\nin order to improve your\nfocus and concentration,\nthat you make sure that that's performed\nnot within four hours prior to bedtime.\nSo that's just a brief example\nof the sorts of tools and protocols\nand details about the tools and protocols\nthat I'll provide on today's episode.\nI should mention that\nwe have provided links\nin the show note captions\nso that you can quickly go to\nthe studies that we describe\nas well as some of the behavioral tools\nand other tools that we'll cover,\nthings like the use of binaural beats,\nsupplements, et cetera.\nOur goal here again\nis to provide you the\nmaximum number of tools\nfor focus and concentration\nthat you can pick from\nand choose from and apply in your life\nand try to eliminate as\nmuch of the legwork required\nto seek out and apply those tools.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous supplements.\nWe partnered with Momentous\nfor several important reasons.\nFirst of all,\nthey ship internationally,\nbecause we know that many of you\nare located outside of the\nUnited States, that's valuable.\nSecond of all, and perhaps most important,\nthe quality of their\nsupplements is second to none,\nboth in terms of purity and precision\nof the amounts of the ingredients.\nThird, we've really emphasized supplements\nthat are single ingredient supplements\nand that are supplied in dosages\nthat allow you to build a\nsupplementation protocol\nthat's optimized for cost,\nthat's optimized for effectiveness,\nand that you can add things\nand remove things from your protocol\nin a way that's really\nsystematic and scientific.\nThis is really hard to do\nif you're taking blends\nof different supplements\nor if the dosages are such\nthat you can't titrate,\nor that is adjust the dosages,\nof a given supplement.\nSo by using single ingredient supplements,\nyou can really build\nout the supplement kit\nthat's ideal for you\nand your specific needs.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partner with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman.\nThere you'll see those supplements.\nAnd just keep in mind\nthat we are constantly expanding\nthe library of supplements\navailable through Momentous\non a regular basis.\nAgain, that's livemomentous.com/huberman.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd to be quite honest,\nI don't like the word nootropics\nbecause the translation of\nnootropics is smart drugs.\nAnd as a neuroscientist, I can tell you\nthere is no neural circuit\nin the brain for being smart.\nRather, there are neural circuits\nthat are responsible for focus,\nneural circuits for creativity,\nneural circuits, for task\nswitching and so on and so on.\nFortunately, Thesis understands this\nand has developed custom nootropics\nthat are tailored to your specific goals\nand your specific needs.\nThey use only the highest\nquality ingredients,\nthings of the sort that we'll\ntalk about in today's podcast,\nthings like Alpha-GPC, phosphatidylserine,\nginko biloba, et cetera.\nHowever, I should mention that\nthey are customized to you.\nSo you can go to Thesis,\ntake a brief quiz,\nand you can get a nootropic starter kit\nthat will allow you to\ntry various nootropics\nand determine which ones\nyou like and work for you\nand which ones don't.\nI've been using Thesis\nnootropics customized for me\nfor close to six months now\nand can confidently say\nthat their nootropics have\nbeen a total game changer.\nMy go-to formula is the Clarity Formula,\nI like to use that before cognitive work,\nand I use the Energy\nFormula before my workouts.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman,\ntake that three minute quiz\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has all the things you\nneed and none of what you don't.\nThat means the electrolytes,\nsalt, magnesium, and\npotassium are in there,\nbut it does not have sugar.\nElectrolytes are key to cellular function,\nin particular neuronal\nor nerve cell function.\nIn fact, for your nerve cells\nto be able to fire action potentials,\nthose are the electrical signals\nthat allow your brain and body\nto work and move and think,\net cetera, you need sodium,\na lot of people don't realize that.\nAnd while of course there\nare people out there\nthat need to reduce their sodium intake,\nthese would be people with\npre-hypertension or hypertension,\nmany people actually\ndon't get enough sodium,\nespecially people that are\nfollowing low carbohydrate diets,\ndrinking a lot of caffeine\nor eating extremely clean.\nOftentimes, those people feel better\nwhen they increase their sodium intake\nand their health can actually improve\nwhen they increase their sodium intake.\nLMNT contains a science\nbacked electrolyte ratio\nof one gram of sodium, 200\nmilligrams of potassium\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's l-m-n-t.com/huberman\nto claim a free element\nsample pack with any purchase.\nAgain, that's drink LMNT,\nl-m-n-t.com/huberman.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nwith heating, cooling, and\nsleep tracking capacity.\nThe reality is that\nsleep is the foundation\nof mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nNow I've talked before in\nthis podcast about the fact\nthat there's a direct\nrelationship between temperature\nand our ability to fall and stay asleep.\nIn fact, our body temperature\nneeds to drop by about\none to three degrees\nin order to fall asleep\nand then there are further\ndecreases in our body temperature\nthat allow us to get into\nthe deepest stages of sleep\nand the so-called rapid\neye movement sleep,\nall the aspects of sleep\nthat really restore our brain and body.\nAnd then waking up\nactually involves a heating\nup of core body temperature.\nBy sleeping on an Eight\nSleep mattress cover,\nyou're able to control the temperature\nof your sleeping environment precisely.\nI've been sleeping on an\nEight Sleep mattress cover\nfor many months now\nand I can tell you it has\ncompletely changed my sleep.\nI thought I was sleeping\npretty well before and now,\nfrankly, I don't even want to travel\nbecause I don't want to be\naway from my Eight Sleep.\nI can't wait until hotels and\nAirbnbs include Eight Sleep.\nIf you want to try Eight Sleep,\nyou

Canada,\nand the United Kingdom.\nAgain, that's\neightsleep.com/huberman to save $250\noff an Eight Sleep cover\nnow through September 11th.\nOkay, let's talk about\nfocus and concentration\nand how you can improve\nyour focus and concentration\nusing science based protocols.\nNow because today's episode\nis mainly focused on tools\nand not so much the underlying mechanisms,\nI'm mainly going to focus\non what to do and when\nand how to do it.\nBut I just want to take\nabout three minutes\nand briefly describe a model,\nthat is a visual image that\nyou can put in your mind,\nthat will help you incorporate\nthe tools that I'll provide\nand that generally will\nhelp you understand\nat a mechanistic level how\nfocus and concentration work.\nSo what I want you to imagine is an arrow.\nAnd an arrow of course, has an arrowhead\nand it has the shaft of that arrow.\nAnd in the context of the neuroscience\nof focus and concentration,\nthe neurochemical system\nthat really represents\nthe shaft of that arrow,\nright, the straight line is epinephrine,\nalso called adrenaline.\nAnd today,\nI'll refer to adrenaline and\nepinephrine interchangeably.\nTurns out that epinephrine/adrenaline\nare released within your\nbrain from a little location,\na little cluster of neurons\ncalled locus coeruleus,\nbut you do not need to remember that name,\nand from your body from\nthe adrenal glands.\nAnd the release of epinephrine\nfrom those two locations\noverall increases energy,\nit increases alertness.\nIt does not alone increase focus, okay?\nSo the reason I've assigned epinephrine,\nadrenaline as the shaft of the arrow\nis that if focus is the arrow,\nthere is no focus without epinephrine.\nSo things,\nwhether or not they're\nbehavioral or psychological\nor supplements or drugs\nthat increase epinephrine\nallow focus to occur, they\nare necessary for focus,\nbut they are not sufficient for focus,\nthat is they are required\nbut they are not enough to create focus.\nSo we're going to need\nepinephrine in the equation.\nWithout epinephrine, there\nis no focus or concentration.\nNow the arrowhead on this\nmetaphorical arrowhead\nthat represents focus and concentration\nis going to be represented\nor related to the\nmechanisms of acetylcholine,\na different neurochemical\nthat also exists in the brain and body.\nIn fact, in the body,\nit's responsible\nfor the contraction and\nmovement of your muscles.\nBut today, we're talking\nabout acetylcholine\nnot in that context,\nbut rather in the context of\nits release within the brain.\nAcetylcholine is released\nfrom a couple of different\nlocations in the brain\nand the best way to think about\nit is it's like a spotlight.\nIt highlights specific\nneurons, nerve cells\nthat should be active, or\nmore active I should say,\nthan the other neurons in the environment.\nSo the reason I've assigned\nthe arrowhead to acetylcholine\nand acetylcholine to the arrowhead\nis that if you have an arrow\nwith a very big arrowhead\nthat's really broad, really broad,\nimagine a mile wide arrowhead,\nthat's not very focused\non any one location,\nit's not really pointing\nto any one location, is it?\nBut with a narrow, really\ntightly focused arrowhead,\nwell, that's focused on one location.\nSo we have alertness, epinephrine,\nand then we have the actual direction\nin which our concentration\nand focus is placed,\nand that's,\nat least in this mental model\nI'm creating, acetylcholine.\nAnd then in order to have ongoing focus,\nwe need another neurochemical.\nAnd it turns out that that\nthird neurochemical is dopamine,\na molecule often associated\nwith pleasure and reward,\nbut it's really the\nmolecule of motivation.\nSo here, I want you to\nimagine in your mind,\nan arrow with an arrowhead,\nthink acetylcholine in the arrowhead,\na shaft or a line behind that arrowhead,\nwhich is epinephrine\nalso called adrenaline.\nAnd then behind it,\na sort of an engine that keeps\nthat focus moving forward,\nright because we don't just\nwant to be focused for a moment,\nwe want to be able to focus\nfor 10 minutes or for an hour\nor maybe even for two hours.\nTurns out there's an\noptimal duration to focus,\nI'll teach you that in just a little bit,\nbut these three neurochemicals together,\nacetylcholine, epinephrine\nand dopamine really allow you\nto get focused, to focus very precisely,\nand in fact, increasingly\nprecisely over time\nto really narrow and narrow\nand narrow your focus\nprogressively within a\nsingle about of focus\nand to continue to do that\nand to be able to do that\nrepeatedly whenever you want.\nSo here, I'm purely talking in metaphor\nand in models and mental models of arrows,\nbut in a moment or two,\nI'll start transitioning\nto discussing tools\nin which I'll talk about\nincreasing dopamine and acetylcholine\nor increasing epinephrine and dopamine\nin various combinations\nwith various approaches.\nAnd what I'd like you to conceptualize\nis how those are contributing\nto creating a very narrowly pointed arrow\nthat has the capacity\nto continue moving forward over and over\nso that you can focus as\nsharply and as long as you like.\nAnd of course, for those of you\nthat want to get really down in the weeds\nof how dopamine works,\nwe have an entire episode\nabout dopamine motivation and drive\nthat really gets into\nneurotransmitter release\nand dopamine baselines and thresholds\nand all of that sort of thing.\nWe also have episodes on focus,\nmuch longer episodes,\nI should say on focus\nthat incorporate a lot of\nthe biology of acetylcholine.\nIt turns out acetylcholine\nis also involved\nin neuroplasticity, et cetera,\nand epinephrine of\ncourse, relates to stress\nand our capacity to deal\nwith and buffer stress\nand on and on.\nThose episodes are all available to you\nin their long form at hubermanlab.com,\nyou can find them very easily.\nThey are all timestamped\nso you can navigate to\nthe particular topics\nmost of interest to you.\nI mention this all not as a diversion\nfrom what we want to cover today,\nbut I know that some of you are hungry\nfor a lot more mechanism,\nbut today's episode is really\nmainly focused on the tools,\nI will of course touch on mechanism,\nbut if you really want to do\nthe deep dive on mechanism,\ngo to hubermanlab.com\nand you'll have more\nthan you ever could want\nabout those mechanisms.\nLet's jump into the tools\nfor concentration and focus.\nIf you want to think\nabout tools of any kind\nto modify your biology\nor physiology in any way,\nwhether or not it's for cognitive function\nor you want to get better at exercising,\nor you want to build muscle,\nor you want to improve your hormones,\nyou need to think and understand tools\nin the context of\nmodulation and mediation.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, it's quite simple really.\nMediation is how specific\ntypes of chemicals and cells\nand circuits and organs\ncontrol very specific things\nin your brain and body\nwhereas modulation\nis the ability of chemicals\nand cells and circuits\nto adjust how different things change,\nhow different things work\nin your brain and body,\nbut to do it more broadly.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nLet me give an example.\nFor instance, I'm going to tell you now\nthat one of the most important things\nto build and maintain your\nfocus and concentration\nis to optimize your sleeping behavior,\nthat is to get enough quality sleep\nI would say 80% of the\nnights of your life.\nNot everyone can get optimal sleep\n100% of the nights of their life,\nnobody, truly nobody achieves that.\nHowever, sleep has been shown\nto relate to cognitive\nperformance, physical performance,\nhormone output, and so many other things,\nincluding immune system function.\nWhat we can reliably say\nis that sleep modulates\njust about every process\nin your brain and body.\nSo you have to get great sleep.\nThere is simply no tool\nthat's going to allow you\nto overcome chronic sleep deprivation\nand allow you to remain focused,\nno pill, no device, no supplement,\nno protocol whatsoever.\nThere are tools to overcome one night\nor maybe two nights of sleep deprivation\nand we'll talk about those,\nbut at a fundamental level,\nwe need to do the things\nthat modulate our focus and\nattention in powerful ways\nand sleep really is that thing.\nSo we've done two episodes,\none called \"Master Your Sleep\"\nand the other episode\nis \"Perfect Your Sleep.\"\nThe \"Perfect Your Sleep\"\nis a little bit more like this episode,\nmore focused on protocols.\n\"Master Your Sleep\" includes\nprotocols and mechanism.\nAgain, you can find\nthose at hubermanlab.com.\nWe also have a sleep toolkit,\na distilled list of things to do\nin order to optimize your sleep.\nI highly recommend that you download that.\nYou can go to hubermanlab.com,\ngo to the Neural Network\nNewsletter, it is listed there.\nIf you want you can sign\nup for the newsletter,\nbut you don't have to,\nyou can simply download\nthe PDF of that toolkit\nfor zero cost.\nWhy do I say sleep modulates\nfocus and attention?\nWell, I'll give an analogy.\nIf right now someone pulled\na fire alarm in this building\nor if we had a fire in this building,\nmy attention would drift,\nit would not be on recording this podcast,\nit would be on something else.\nBut would I say that the fire\nalarm mediates attention?\nI mean fire alarms are not\nreally involved in attention.\nNo, rather they modulate my attention.\nThe noise in the room\nmodulates my attention.\nThat's quite a bit different\nthan a tool that I'll provide later\nand I'll just give you\na little hint of now,\nin fact, I'll give it to you now,\nwhich is that 40 HZ binaural beats\nhave been shown in a number\nof peer reviewed studies\nto increase focus and concentration.\nAnd if you'd like to\naccess 40 HZ binaural beats\nin order to improve your\nfocus and concentration,\nyou can do that, you can\nactually get it at zero cost.\nYou can go into the app store,\nfor instance, the Apple App Store,\nthis is also available for Android phone,\nthere's an app called BrainWave,\nand you can go there,\nyou can dial in 40 HZ\nand it'll play these binaural beats.\nIt's been shown in multiple\nquality peer reviewed studies\nthat playing a pattern of\nsound waves to one ear,\ndo, do, do, do, do,\nand the other ear, which is\nslightly offset in frequency,\nmeaning not quite the same frequencies,\nso more like do, do, do, do,\nthat that combination of frequencies\nplayed to the different ears,\nactually get integrated\nwithin deep brain centers\nand can increase focus and concentration\nin part by increasing levels\nof the neurochemical\ndopamine and acetylcholine,\nwhich we talked about a little bit earlier\nin this arrow model of focus.\nSo we'll provide a link to that app,\nI don't have any relationship\nto that app I should mention,\nbut it's an excellent one,\nit's one that I've used for many years.\nThere are also additional\nfunctions within the app,\nsuch as for sleep and for other things,\nbut the 40 HZ, 4-0-h-z\nis the way it reads out,\n40 HZ stimulation\nhas been shown to improve\nfocus and concentration.\nHere is my recommendation\nand the way that I use it.\nI would not use 40 HZ binaural beats\nevery time I'm doing a about of work.\nWhat I tend to do\nis use it for about five\nminutes prior to that work\nand then turn it off and then do the work\nand I'll talk about other\ntools to use during that work,\nwhether or not it's reading or math\nor even just emailing or\nsomething where I require\na bunch of focus for a while.\nHowever, there are times\nin which I'm in an area\nor I'm in a state of mind\nwhere I'm feeling very distractable\nand then I'll keep the\n40 HZ binaural beats on\nthe entire time\nI'm doing that about of cognitive work.\nI'll also sometimes use\nthe 40 HZ binaural beats\nprior to a workout,\nin particular weight workouts,\nwhere I really want to be able to focus on\nand contract specific muscles.\nSo it's a very useful tool,\nagain, supported by quality\npeer reviewed science,\nzero cost,\navailable out there not\njust in the BrainWave app\nbut in multiple apps.\nI think many of you will benefit from it.\nSome of you might not\nexperience it immediately\nas a total dropping into a tunnel of focus\nin the same way that you might\nwith say the sorts of neurochemicals\nthat we'll talk about later,\nlike Alpha-GPC and some\nof these other things\nthat change neurochemicals directly,\nbut nonetheless 40 HZ binaural beats\nare a very powerful tool,\nagain, zero cost non-pharmacologic tool\nthat tap into your own endogenous,\nmeaning within you or\nexists within you physiology\nin order to increase acetylcholine\nand some other neurochemicals\nand they have been shown\nto work quite well.\nOkay so assuming that\nyou are sleeping well\n80% of the nights of your life\nor at least working on the\nvarious protocols and tools\nto sleep well and sufficiently long\n80% of the nights of your life,\nand you are interested in additional tools\nthat are sound based\nin order to improve your ability\nto concentrate and focus,\nthere are quality peer reviewed\nstudies supporting the idea\nthat white noise or pink noise,\nand believe it or not,\nthere is something called pink noise,\nit has to do with the\nspecific frequencies of sound\nthat are in the noise,\nwell white noise and pink noise\nhave been shown to not\nimprove concentration per se,\nbut to improve people's ability\nto transition into concentrated states.\nSo I don't tend to use\nwhite noise and pink noise\nwhile I work, but I know a\nnumber of people that do.\nI know people that also use\nwhat's called brown noise.\nThe folks I know\nfrom the engineering and\ncomputer science side\nget really into these details\nof white noise, pink noise, brown noise.\nYou can find white noise,\npink noise or brown noise\nand listen to it through\nheadphones or in the room.\nThere is indeed some data\nto support the fact that white noise,\nand to some extent, pink\nnoise and brown noise\ncan support the release of\nparticular neurochemicals,\nbut more data showing that\nthey can amplify the activity\nof neurons in the so-called\nprefrontal cortex,\nthis front area, sort of the\nbumper behind your forehead,\nthat is directly related to your ability\nto direct your own focus\nand remain focused on certain things.\nSo you have the option\nof either using binaural beats before,\nbut not during your work,\nthat is 40 HZ binaural beats,\nor 40 HZ binaural beats\nthroughout your attempt to focus.\nYou also have the option of\nnot using binaural beats,\nbut using white noise,\npink noise or brown noise.\nAgain, there are a lot of zero cost apps,\nyou can find also white noise,\npink noise and brown noise\non YouTube.\nAgain, these are tools\nthat really have been shown\nover and over in humans\nto allow people to focus with more depth\nand to decrease the\ntransition time into focus.\nThis is a really key point.\nA lot of people are challenged\nwith getting into a mode of focus.\nNone of us, however, should be expected\nto just sit down and drop\ndirectly into a state of focus.\nI think that's completely an\nunfair request of ourselves.\nI mean, for instance,\nyou wouldn't expect yourself\nto go out on the track\nor go out for a run and not warm up.\nYou might jog for a few minutes\nor even walk before you would jog\nand then jog before you would run,\nright, I would hope you would do that.\nAnd if you're doing resistance training,\nI doubt that you go over and\nload up the bar or the machine\nwith the maximum amount of\nweight that you can move\nand then just drop right into that,\nyou always do a warmup.\nAnd I think it's very\nimportant to understand\nmental work, focus and concentration\nas requiring that warmup.\nWhat is that warmup?\nWell, you know what that warmup is.\nThat warmup is the ramping up\nor the increase of\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nacetylcholine, and dopamine.\nRight, the way that neurochemicals work\nis we don't just get to\nflip switches in our brain\nbecause we decide to, that's a fantasy.\nThat's sort of the \"Limitless\" movie\nor movies and ideas\nthat suddenly you're going\nto flip a switch on your arm\nand all of a sudden you're\ngoing to be in a laser focus,\nthat is just not the way that\nyour nervous system works.\nThere's a gradual dropping into any state,\nwhether or not that state is sleep,\nright, you go from shallow\nsleep to deep sleep\nand then out eventually.\nFocus too, you go from shallow focus\nto increasingly deep focus.\nThat is, in our metaphor of\nthe arrow, it's very broad,\nit's pointed at a lot of things.\nAnd over time as we drop into focus,\nthat arrow is narrowing and\nnarrowing and narrowing.\nIn fact, probably better\nto think about it narrowing\nand then sometimes oscillating\nand getting wider again.\nWe might hear something down the hallway\nor more typically our phone\nwill buzz or we'll think,\noh, I wonder what so and so is doing\nor I had to contact them about something.\nYour focus is dynamic,\nit is not what we call a step function.\nIt's not like you go\nfrom unfocused to focused\nand then you drop into your maximal focus.\nBy understanding that it's dynamic,\nby understanding that you\nare going to be continually\ngoing in and out\nof progressively but\nvarying levels of focus,\nyou will greatly release\nthe pressure on yourself\nto feel focused all the\ntime when you want to be.\nThis is very key.\nPeople who are very good\nat focusing understand this\nand understand that they\ncan't expect themselves\nto just immediately focus\nand then snap into or out of focus.\nOkay so be patient with yourself\nand also understand that\nfocus is an ability,\nthat you can improve your ability to focus\nby engaging the neural\ncircuits responsible for focus\nrepeatedly over time through\nso-called neuroplasticity,\nthe ability of your nervous system\nto change in response to experience.\nAnd that has a couple\nof different components,\nbut put very simply,\nwhat we repeat gets etched\ninto our nervous system\nand becomes easier over time.\nAnd the more emotionally important\nor vital something feels to us,\nthe more likely it is to\ntrigger neuroplasticity.\nWe're going to talk a little bit more\nabout how to increase neural\ncircuits for focus later,\nbut right now, what you have in hand\nis the key importance of sleep\nand I again will direct\nyou to hubermanlab.com\nand the Neural Network Newsletter\nto really work on optimizing your sleep.\nWe've also got two\nauditory sound based tools\nfor improving focus,\nthere's 40 HZ binaural\nbeats used before or during\nbouts of focus and concentration.\nAnd if you don't like\nthose, or even if you do,\nyou might alternate them with\nor occasionally use white noise,\npink noise or brown noise,\nalso readily available at zero cost.\nA question I often get is how\nlong should I try to focus?\nWell, the research literature\npoint to the key importance\nof so-called ultradian cycles.\nYou've all probably\nheard of circadian cycles\nor circadian biology,\ncirca, the day, circadian,\nis about 24 hour cycle.\nWell, our brain and body\noperate within that day\nor within each and every day I should say\nwith 90 minute ultradian cycles.\nSo my suggestion would be\nanytime you're going to\nsit down and try and focus\nor you're going to try\nand do a focused about\nof physical exercise or skill\nlearning or musical learning,\nor maybe you're even just\nhaving a conversation,\nmaybe you're a therapist\nor you're attending therapy or a class,\nhow long should it be?\nAnd the ideal duration\nis about 90 minutes,\nnot exactly 90 minutes,\nbut we can reliably\nsay 90 minutes or less,\nokay, it doesn't have to\nbe the full 90 minutes.\nBut trying to push yourself\nto be able to drop into\ntwo hours of focus or\nthree hours of focus,\nwhile possible is not really in line\nwith what we know about\nthe underlying biology.\nEverything from our sleep states\nor the different stages of\nsleep and our waking states\nis divided into these 90 minute cycles\nor so-called ultradian cycles.\nSo what I like to do is\nset a timer for 90 minutes.\nI acknowledge and accept the fact\nthat under most conditions\nunless I'm really pressed for a deadline\nand I'm optimally caffeinated, et cetera,\nthe first five to 10\nminutes of that 90 minutes\nare a transition time, it's\nlike the warm up for focus,\nbut I do include it in that 90 minutes.\nAnd then I really try and drop into\ndoing focused mental work\nor learning of some sort,\nagain, this could be physical\nas well, motor skill learning\nor anything, we're running or\nlifting weights, et cetera,\nand really try and drop into that\nacross the full 90 minutes,\nagain accepting the fact,\nokay it's not just an idea,\nthe fact that occasionally\nour focus will flicker,\nit will jump out of focus,\nand then a big part of being able to focus\nis to go back to focusing.\nThe way I'd like you to\nconceptualize this perhaps\nis that arrowhead suddenly\ngetting very, very broad,\nthat you're focusing on many things\nor that arrow shifts to a\ndifferent location in the room.\nThe key is to be able to shift it back\nand to narrow it once again\nand that's an active process,\nso much so that it requires\na lot of metabolic energy,\nyour brain is the chief\nconsumer of metabolic energy.\nThe calories that you consume,\nthe so-called basal metabolic rate,\nmost of that isn't related\nto movement or heartbeat or breathing,\nit's related to brain function.\nYour brain is a glutton with\nrespect to caloric need.\nSo understand that at\nthe end of 90 minutes\nor maybe even after 45 minutes,\nyou might feel rather\ntired or even exhausted.\nAnd it's very important\nthat after a about of focus\nthat you take at least 10 minutes\nand ideally as long as 30 minutes\nand go through what I\ncall deliberate defocus.\nYou really want to focus\non somewhat menial tasks\nor things that really don't require\na ton of your concentration.\nThis is starting to become\na little bit of a movement out there\nin the kind of pop psychology\nand optimization world,\nthis idea of not looking at your phone\nas you walk down the hall to the bathroom,\ncertainly not looking at\nyour phone in the bathroom.\nAnd I should mention, by the way,\nthis is a particular annoyance of mine,\nhave you noticed that wait times\nfor restrooms in public places\nhas increased substantially\nin the last 10 years?\nThe reason for that is\nnot digestive, okay,\nit's not the gut microbiome,\nI mean it might be the gut microbiome,\nbut chances are\nit's because people are on\ntheir phones in the bathroom.\nSo you're doing yourself\nand everybody else a favor\nby staying off your phone in the restroom,\nstaying off your phone\nwhile walking down the hall.\nTry and give yourself some time\nto deliberately decompress,\nto let your mental states idle,\nto not be focused on any one thing.\nThat period of idling\nis essential for your ability to focus,\nmuch in the same way\nthat rest between sets\nof resistance training\nor rest between exercise\nis vital to being able\nto focus and perform\nduring the actual sets or\nduring the actual bouts\nof running or cycling\nor whatever your particular\nform of exercise might be.\nSo deliberate decompression is key.\nAnd I know this is hard because\nwe're all being drawn in\nby the incredible rich array\nof sensory information available\non our phones and other devices,\nbut I can't emphasize this enough,\nour ability to focus is not just related\nto what happens during\nthe entry and movement\nthrough those focused bouts\nbut after those focused bouts.\nWe really need to deliberately decompress.\nAnd of course, the ultimate decompress,\nthe time in which we are not directing\nour thinking interaction is during sleep.\nAnd so it's no wonder,\nor I should say it holds\ntogether logically,\nthat that deep, long lasting duration\nof not controlling where our mind is at\nis in fact the ultimate\nform of restoration,\neven if we have very intense dreams.\nSo take that period after each\n90 minute or less focus about,\nright, remember those focus bouts\ndon't have to be full 90 minutes,\nlet's say you do 45 minutes of work,\nyou're just done with it,\nset it down and go do\nsomething for maybe five, 10,\nmaybe even 30 minutes that\nis functional for your day,\nright, not just walking around in circles\nor staring up at the sky\nalthough if you can do that, do that,\nbut most of us have other things to do,\nbut do things that are rather automatic\nor reflexive for you,\nand try not to do any focused reading,\ntry not to bring your vision\ninto a tight location,\nsuch as your phone and try\nand deliberately decompress,\nbecause that will allow you\nto drop into intense spouts of focus\nagain repeatedly and\nrepeatedly throughout the day.\nI'm often asked how many ultradian cycles\none can perform throughout the day?\nThat depends on how well you've slept,\nhow well you are nourished,\nwhich we'll talk about in a moment,\nand how well trained up\nyour focus capacity is.\nAnd here's the paradox,\nif you are very trained at focusing,\nif you're very good at\ndropping into focus,\nyou're actually going to need\nmore deliberate decompression and defocus\nand I recommend only doing about two,\nmaybe three deep work sessions per day.\nSo not one 90 minute session\nthan expecting yourself\nto do to another one and\nanother one, another one,\nbut rather one deep\nwork 90 minute session,\nand maybe another in the afternoon.\nA lot of people get\nsurprised by this and say,\n\"Wait, how many people can afford\nto just work three hours a day?\"\nI'm not saying just\nwork three hours a day.\nI'm really talking about\nthe hard mental work.\nAnd again, somewhat paradoxically,\nthe more you can concentrate,\nthe more deeply you can concentrate,\nthe fewer deep work concentration bouts\nyou can actually perform each day.\nThis makes sense, however,\nif you think about it in the context\nof say resistance training.\nIf you are stronger and\nstronger in the gym,\nor you're an endurance athlete\nand you can run ultra-marathons,\n100 miles or so,\nyou are essentially cutting a deeper cut\ninto your recovery capacity\nthan somebody who's not\nvery skilled at those things\nor can't perform as much intense work.\nSo the intensity of the\nwork scales directly\nwith how long you need\nto rest after that work.\nI at this stage of my life am pretty good\nat dropping into\nand maintaining focused\nbouts of concentration\nprovided the landscape\nof my life is right,\nyou know, I don't have some\nburning stressful thing\nthat's essential or an\nemergency that I'm tending to\nand that I put my phone\naway or turn it off,\nI can do three 90 minute\nfocus bouts per day,\nbut that's about it.\nAnd then in between those focus bouts,\nI'm doing other things\nthat require less focus.\nSome of you may be able to perform four.\nWhat I highly recommend\nis that you try doing at least one,\nthat is one 90 minute or less\nabout of focused\nconcentrated work per day,\nand yes, that means the weekends too.\nAnd on the weekends, I like to read a book\nwith my phone nowhere in\nsight, not on a device,\nthat's what I do or I'll listen\nto an audiobook sometimes\nwhile taking a walk,\nbut really concentrating on\nwhat I'm trying to learn,\nwhat I'm hearing and what I'm seeing.\nSo again, a daily 90 minute\nabout is one to start with\nand I would say after\nabout four weeks of that,\nif you're able to stay concentrated\nand work through the agitation,\nthen I would consider increasing\nthe number of focus bouts.\nAgain, this is not to say\nthat you should go to your teacher\nor your PhD advisor or your\nparent or your friends and say,\n\"Listen, I can't really\nconcentrate or think about anything\nfor more than 90 minutes per day.\"\nThat's not what I'm saying.\nThese are deep focus bouts.\nThese are bouts of work,\nor I should say mental\nwork or physical work\nwhere you're really forcing\nyourself to focus and refocus,\nto sharpen the head of that arrowhead,\nto redirect it to what you're\ntrying to concentrate on,\nand it is indeed hard work.\nI would even think about it\nmore or less like a workout of any kind.\nBefore we continue with\ntoday's discussion,\nwe're going to take a brief pause\nto acknowledge our\nsponsor Athletic Greens,\nalso called AG1.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012\nso I'm delighted that\nthey've been a sponsor\nof this podcast.\nAthletic Greens contains\nvitamins, minerals, probiotics,\ndigestive enzymes, and adaptogens,\nso it's got a lot of things in there\nand that's actually the\nreason I started taking it\nand the reason I still take\nit once or twice a day.\nIt essentially covers all\nof my nutritional bases\nand the probiotics in\nparticular are important to me\nbecause of the critical importance\nof what's called the gut brain axis,\nthat is neurons and other\ncell types in the gut,\nin the digestive tract that\ncommunicate with the brain\nand the brain back to the digestive tract\nin order to control things\nlike mood, immune function,\nhormone function, and on and on.\nWhenever somebody has asked me,\nwhat's the one supplement\nthey should take,\nI always answer Athletic Greens.\nI gave that answer long\nbefore I ever had this podcast\nand it's the answer I still give now\nfor all the reasons that I\ndetailed just a moment ago.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3+K2,\nwhich are also very important\nfor a huge number of bodily\nfactors and brain factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health.\nAgain, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nI'd like to call your attention\nto a new and extremely useful tool\nfor learning and applying\nscience based protocols\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nIt's called Virtusan,\nv-i-r-t-u-s-a-n, and it's an app.\nAnd inside the app, you'll\nfind what are called journeys.\nEach journey is aimed at a specific goal,\nsuch as improving your\nsleep or tracking your sleep\nor improving your ability\nto focus and concentrate\nor improving your nutrition\nor specific exercise programs.\nThe Virtusan app makes\na lot of the protocols\nthat you've seen here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast and elsewhere\nvery easy to understand\nand access and practice.\nAnd in fact, it tracks your progress\nwith each of these protocols.\nI and several other researchers\nhave been directly involved\nin developing the specific\njourneys and protocols\nthat you'll find within the Virtusan app.\nIn fact, a lot of it involves\ndirect video tutorials from me\nand others that you'll recognize\nfrom social media and from podcasts.\nEverything that you'll find\nwithin the Virtusan app\nis geared towards giving\nyou the latest science\nin simple, straightforward protocols\nto allow you to improve your\nmental health, physical health\nand performance.\nIf you want check it out,\nyou can go to the App\nStore under Virtusan,\nagain, that's spelled v-i-r-t-u-s-a-n,\nor you can go to virtusan.com/huberman.\nAgain, that's virtusan.com/huberman.\nI mentioned the topic of\nnutrition a little bit ago,\nand of course, nutrition\nis a complicated topic.\nIn fact, one of the quickest ways\nto get yourself into a battle online\nis to say something\ndefinitive about nutrition.\nI just want to clearly state\nmy stance about nutrition.\nI fully support and applaud\nthose of you that are\nvegans for whatever reason,\nthose of you that are pure\ncarnivore for whatever reason,\nand those of you that are\nomnivores for whatever reason.\nI happen to be an omnivore.\nMy goal is always to eat high quality,\nminimally or non-processed foods\nand to eat things in moderation.\nSo I do eat some meat\nfrom sustainable sources\nor from organic sources,\nI eat some starches and I eat\nvegetables and I eat fruits,\nI try not to eat sugars\nand I don't really like\nhighly processed foods\nat this point in my life.\nThat's me, that's what I do,\nbut I'm certainly not dictating\nwhat people should eat.\nI know certain people are ketogenic,\nand I can say that for\npeople who achieve ketosis\nand can get into ketosis,\nyes indeed, there is a mental\nstate associated with ketosis\nthat will allow your brain to function\nand to think really clearly\nthat many people find very attractive\nand keep them going\nback over and over again\nto a ketogenic diet.\nI'm somebody who for instance\nhas not been in ketosis\nmany times in my life,\nat least not deliberately so,\nbut I actually will ingest\nliquid ketones from time to time\nbecause of the further\ncognitive enhancement\nand physical enhancement that I experience\non top of nutrition that does\ninclude some carbohydrates.\nSo there are a lot of different\nways to approach all this,\nwhether or not you're a vegan, omnivore,\nvegetarian, carnivore, et\ncetera, the point is this,\nyour ability to focus,\nand in fact, your ability of neurons\nto encode specific information\nin your environment,\nthat is to represent what's\nout there in the world,\nis actually related to\nyour blood glucose level.\nNow here I'm setting aside the discussion\nof ketosis and ketogenic\ndiets for the moment,\nbut there's a beautiful study\nthat was published in Neuron not long ago\nthat showed that the tuning,\nthat is the precision with\nwhich neurons in the brain\nwill represent things in our environment\nis actually much greater\nwhen there is sufficient\nglucose in the brain.\nTranslated into English, this\nmeans that when we are fasted\nor when our blood glucose is very low,\nwe aren't able to perceive\nand think about things\nas clearly.\nNow there's a twist to this, however.\nMany people who practice\nintermittent fasting,\nand I should say\nI practice a sort of pseudo\nintermittent fasting,\nI generally eat my meals\nbetween the hours of 11:00 AM and 8:00 PM\nalthough sometimes there's\nsome wiggle around that,\noccasionally have an early breakfast,\nI'm not super rigid about it,\nbut I know there are a number of people\nwho are doing longer fasts\nor they're eating in a six hour window.\nWe did an entire episode about fasting,\nyou can again find that\nat hubermanlab.com,\nwe'll likely have Satchin Panda,\nwho's an expert in intermittent\nfasting, on the podcast.\nIntermittent fasting\nhas a lot of different potential benefits.\nFor some people,\nit's a convenient way to\nrestrict their calories.\nFor other people, it's a\nconvenient way to avoid eating,\nthat is it's easier to not eat\nthan to eat a small portion\nso they opt for intermittent\nfasting and so on and so forth.\nBut one of the things\nthat you hear very often\nis that some people like being fasted\nbecause they like the clarity\nof mind that it provides.\nHere's the situation.\nNeurons, unless you're\nin a ketogenic diet,\nreally thrive on glucose,\nthey love glucose.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nyour ability to think and perceive things\nis actually enhanced\nby having sufficient\nglucose in your bloodstream.\nSo why would it be that\nsome people experience\na heightened state of mental\nclarity when they are fasted?\nI've certainly experienced that before.\nWell, I should say\nthat provided you're well hydrated enough\nand you have enough\nelectrolytes in your system,\nwhat tends to happen is\nthat when you ingest food,\nthere's a shift in your nervous system\ntowards so-called parasympathetic mode,\nthat is the more relaxed,\nyou've probably heard\nit as rest and digest,\nalthough it does other things,\nthe more relaxed mode that can\nindeed make us very sleepy.\nIf we have too many carbohydrates,\nit actually can make us quite sleepy.\nHowever, if we have any food,\nif we have enough of it,\nthat is if our gut is full,\nit diverts blood to our gut\nand we become sleepy and\nwe can't focus as well.\nSo a lot of people really like fasting\nand the state of being fasted\nfor focus and concentration\nbecause they don't have as much\nof that parasympathetic activation,\nthey're just not as sleepy.\nAnd in fact, under those conditions,\nhalf as much caffeine will\ngive you just as much lift\nas twice as much caffeine will give you\non a full belly of pasta\nand that's just the way\nthat caffeine interacts\nwith blood glucose.\nSo what I'd like you to imagine\nis if you had a measure\nof focus from zero to 10,\nthese are arbitrary units,\n10 being maximally focused\nand zero being not focused at all,\nimagine a U-shaped function, right,\nwhere if you're very fasted,\nyou're going to have high degree\nof focus and concentration,\nbut then if you ingest some\nfood and your belly is full,\nyour focus and concentration is reduced.\nBut having enough blood glucose\nand maybe even elevated blood glucose\nwill increase cognitive function.\nSo there are two ends of the spectrum.\nOn one end of the spectrum,\nblood glucose is relatively\nlow and you're fasted\nand you can think and behave\nin a very concentrated way\nand on the other end of the spectrum,\nyou have a lot of blood\nglucose, or I should say,\nsufficient blood glucose,\nyou never want your blood\nglucose to be too high,\nand that allows your neurons\nto encode and perceive\nand basically allow you\nto think really clearly.\nSo you sort of have to\npick your condition.\nWhat do you want for your bouts\nof focus and concentration?\nI actually do both.\nSo what I do is, as I mentioned before,\nI eat my meal sometime around 11:00 AM,\nmy first meal typically\nunless I'm very hungry when I wake up.\nAnd so I will do my workout\nand one about of focused work.\nI always think of this as my\nhard work early in the day\nand I do that fasted,\nI'll be consuming water with electrolytes,\nmaybe LMNT or other electrolytes,\nmaybe some caffeine as well\nin the form of yerba mate\nor coffee, that's my first focus\nabout of 90 minutes or less,\nthat is essentially done\nfasted and then I'll eat\nand then I do notice after I eat,\nI actually have a diminished\ncapacity to focus.\nBut then again in the afternoon,\nI will do another 90\nminute about of focus,\nand I'll talk about\nsome of the tools I use\nto make sure that that\nabout of focus is optimal\nfor getting the most amount\nof focused work done,\nwhether or not it's mental\nwork or physical work,\nalthough I tend to do my\nphysical work early in the day\nand my mental work both\nearly and late in the day.\nSo to make this very simple\nor as simple as I can for you\nbeing fasted is great for\nfocus and concentration\nprovided you're not thinking\nabout food the entire time\nand being fed is terrific\nfor focus and concentration,\nit actually can improve neuronal function\nprovided that you didn't\neat too much food.\nSo one way to manage this\nis if you're going to have a lunch,\nto make sure that you don't\nstuff yourself at lunch,\nthat you're not overeating\nand to not get quite so full\nthat you put your nervous system\ninto this parasympathetic mode\nand make it hard to\nfocus in the afternoon.\nI know a lot of people experience a dip\nor even a crash in energy in the afternoon\nthat make it really hard to focus.\nFor that reason, I'll just remind people\nof a tool I've talked\nabout many times before,\nwhich is based on the biology\nof adenosine and caffeine, et cetera,\nwhich is to delay your\nfirst caffeine intake\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking up.\nI know that can be painful\nfor certain people.\nI violate that rule,\nwhen I'm working out very\nearly in the morning.\nI'll drink my caffeine before my workout\nwhich often occurs within\n30 to 60 minutes of waking.\nBut in general, unless I'm\nworking out very early,\nI will ingest my caffeine 90\nto 120 minutes after I wake up.\nSo again, I want to emphasize\nthat if you hear somebody out there say\nbeing fasted is optimal for\nfocus and concentration.\nWell, that is true in one context\nand perhaps ideal for a\ncertain part of the day.\nAnd other people will say,\nno, neurons run on glucose,\nyou need glucose in your bloodstream\nin order to get those neurons to be tuned,\nthat is to respond with\nelectrical activity\nin the optimal way when\nyou're reading something\nor when you're trying to perform exercise.\nWell, that's also true.\nAnd of course, you can incorporate both.\nI, in fact as I just described,\nincorporate both fasted\nstates and fed states\nin order to optimize my\nconcentration and focus.\nAnd as a brief note about ketosis,\nfor those of you that actually managed\nto transition into ketosis\nand are maintaining a ketogenic state,\nthat, as I mentioned earlier,\ncan enhance brain function,\nconcentration and focus\nbecause of the way in\nwhich ketones can be used\nas a so-called optimal fuel for neurons.\nThe ketogenic diet was\noriginally designed, if you will,\nfor epilepsy,\nit has a whole relationship to epilepsy\nand controlling epileptic seizures,\nand it can in fact allow people\nto achieve focus,\nconcentrated brain states.\nSo in the future, I'll do\nan episode about ketosis\nand be sure to circle back\non how to optimize ketosis\nfor focus and concentration.\nAlthough I have to believe\nthat most of the people listening to this\nare probably not in ketosis\nor following a ketogenic diet\nso that's why I mainly focused\non fasted states and fed states.\nAnd just to make sure that I'm thorough,\na fasted state to me\nwould be a state in which you\nhaven't ingested any calories,\nbut may have ingested caffeine\nor maybe even a small amount\nof artificial sweetener\nor something like that,\nbut really haven't ingested\nany significant number of calories\nin the previous four to\neight or maybe even 12 hours.\nAnd again, there's\ntremendous variation here,\ndepending on how long people have fasted,\nwhether or not we're\ntalking about the state\nright after people wake up, et cetera.\nAgain, if you're interested\nin intermittent fasting,\nboth for the sake of mental\nand physical health and performance,\ncheck out our episode on\nfasting at hubermanlab.com.\nI also want to touch back on this idea\nof which foods can increase focus.\nYou know, in the episode\non ADHD that I did,\nI touched on this quite a bit\nas it relates to elimination diets.\nThere's a whole industry\nand a ton of interest for obvious reasons\ninto what sorts of things kids and adults\nshould and shouldn't eat\nin order to reduce symptoms of ADHD.\nI think that the sum total of\nthose data point to the fact\nthat reducing simple sugar intake\nand certainly highly processed foods,\nso ice cream, candy, chips, et cetera,\nthose sorts of things,\nreally does seem to\nimprove symptoms of ADHD\nin both children and adults.\nBut once you move past\nthat and you start to say,\nwell, which foods can improve\nconcentration and focus?\nWell, foods that for instance\ninclude a lot of tyrosine,\nwhich is a precursor to dopamine,\nand now you know why dopamine\nis important in this context,\nare certainly going to increase\nconcentration and focus.\nSo things like Parmesan cheese,\ncertain meats, certain nuts,\nyou can look up which foods\ncontain high amounts of tyrosine.\nThere are also some fruits and vegetables\nthat include high amounts of tyrosine,\nbut to be quite direct,\nit doesn't matter whether or\nnot you're ingesting foods\nthat are rich in the precursor amino acids\nto dopamine, acetylcholine, et cetera,\nif you are consuming large\namounts of those foods.\nThat is one can look and see for instance,\nthat a steak includes\na lot of the precursors\nto acetylcholine.\nIt has amino acid precursors\nto dopamine as well\nand there are other foods\nthat will do that as well,\nbut if I were to ingest\nsay two ribeye steaks,\nthat's a lot of meat\nand it will direct a\nlot of blood to my gut\nand it will cause me to be sleepy\nand that will create challenges of me\nbeing able to achieve states\nof focus and concentration.\nSo the simple way to put\nthis is if you eat too much\nor you eat a very large volume of food,\nyou are going to diminish\nyour focus and concentration.\nThe key is to eat enough\nthat you're nourished for\nthe certain activities,\nmental and physical that\nyou need to perform,\nbut if you're eating large meals,\nyou are going to diminish\nyour concentration and focus\nperiod.\nI know many people are curious\nas to whether or not caffeine\ncan improve focus and\nconcentration, and indeed it can.\nThere is an immense amount\nof data supporting the idea\nthat caffeine,\nprovided its consumed in\nthe appropriate dosages,\ncan improve mental performance\nand physical performance,\nand it largely does that\nthrough improvements in\nfocus and concentration.\nThe dosage of caffeine of course,\nis going to depend on how\ncaffeine adapted you are,\nhow much caffeine tolerance you have.\nAnd that is going to vary tremendously\ndepending on whether or not\nyou ingest that caffeine\nwith or without food,\nas I mentioned earlier.\nBut there is a kind of general range\nin which we can talk about caffeine\nas being useful for\nfocus and concentration.\nAnd the range is basically\nfrom 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams.\nI want to caution everybody out there,\nif you're somebody who\nsuffers from anxiety\nor panic attacks,\nand you're not used to ingesting caffeine\nand you run out and ingest\n400 milligrams of caffeine\nin the form of espresso or yerba mate\nor an energy drink or in pill form,\nthat is going to be very\nuncomfortable for you,\nyou're going to be sweating profusely,\nyour heart rate is going to increase,\nyou're going to be quite panicked in fact\nor at least anxious.\nSo be cautious with your\nuse and adopting of caffeine\nif you're not already caffeine adapted,\nbut most people do quite well\nto ingest 100 to 200\nmilligrams of caffeine\nprior to doing some focused work.\nAnd again, I recommend\ndelaying your caffeine intake\nto 90 to 120 minutes after waking,\nunless you're using that caffeine\nto really jolt your\nsystem before a workout.\nCaffeine can of course be\ningested in various forms,\neven pill form,\nbut most people ingest\nit in the form of coffee\nor my particular favorite\nway to ingest caffeine\nis yerba mate.\nIt is important and I should note\nthat you should actively avoid\nthe smoked versions of yerba mate\nas they contain a lot of carcinogenic,\ncancer promoting compounds.\nThere's some great yerba\nmate brands out there.\nThe most cost effective way to consume it\nwould be to use the loose leaf tea\nand to pour water over that.\nThere's one particular brand that I like,\nI don't have any affiliation\nto them whatsoever,\nbut I've been using it\nfor years, it's Anna Park.\nIt's an organic brand that is\nsold, I buy mine on Amazon,\nyou can find it elsewhere\non the internet as well.\nAgain, I don't have any\naffiliation to them,\nit's just very cost effective, very clean,\nit doesn't have the smoked flavor,\nat least the one that I buy\nis not the smoked variety\nso none of the carcinogenic\ncompounds are in there\nat least that I'm aware of\nand I like the way it tastes\nand it provides a very\neven lift and stimulant\nthat I think certainly works for me\nand that a number of people I know\nthat I have suggested to also enjoy.\nYerba mate or caffeine also\nhave other additional benefits,\nin particular, the caffeine\nin yerba mate and coffee\nand other sources of caffeine\nare known to increase\nthe density and efficacy,\nthat is the number and the\nfunction of dopamine receptors,\nand this has been shown\nin humans several times.\nSo by ingesting caffeine pretty regularly,\nyou're actually increasing\nthe ability of dopamine\nto have this effect of\nincreasing motivation and drive.\nI tend to ingest caffeine\nonly early in the day,\nI tend to cut off my caffeine intake\nsomewhere around one or 2:00 PM\nto ensure that I can get\ninto a good night's sleep,\nbut I realize that there\nare people out there\nthat ingest caffeine\nas late as two or three in the afternoon\nand can still sleep fine.\nI will caution those of you\nthat think that you can drink caffeine\nin the evening or nighttime\nand still fall asleep.\nAll of the research points to the fact\nthat the architecture of your sleep\nand the depth of your sleep is disrupted.\nEven if you're able to\nfall and stay asleep,\nthe sleep you're getting\nis simply not as good\nas the sleep you would get\nif you were to shut off\nyour caffeine intake\nat least eight hours before bedtime,\nand ideally more like 10 or\neven 12 hours before bedtime.\nBut of course, there are\npractical constraints as well.\nOkay so caffeine is\nincreasing dopamine's function\nby changing the number and\nefficacy of dopamine receptors,\nbut of course, it also\nincreases our wakefulness,\nour alertness,\nand that is largely through\nthe neurochemical systems\nrelated to adenosine,\nwhich is a molecule that\nbuilds up in our brain and body\nthe longer we are awake,\nit's part of the sleepiness\nsystem if you will,\nit makes us feel fatigued or tired,\nand caffeine also operates\non the epinephrine,\nthe adrenaline system.\nIn fact, if we ingest too much caffeine,\nwe'll sometimes get the jitters.\nThose jitters are really the\nsympathetic, as it's called,\nnervous system's bias toward movement,\nand our pupils will dilate,\nthey actually get broader.\nNow somewhat paradoxically,\nwhen our pupils get bigger,\nthe pupils of our eyes that is,\nour visual world actually narrows,\nit becomes more tunnel-like.\nA lot of people don't realize this.\nWhen our pupils are really\nsmall, that means we are relaxed.\nSo if you ever see someone\nwith really tiny or pin size pupils,\nthey're very relaxed.\nIf their pupils are very\nbig, they're very dilated,\nwell then they are very amped up,\nthey are very, very alert.\nCaffeine increases alertness\nby increasing epinephrine,\nadrenaline release both in\nthe brain and within the body.\nAnd so that's another\nway that it facilitates\nfocus and concentration.\nNow there are other ways\nto increase epinephrine\nin the brain and body besides\ncaffeine or other stimulants,\nand in fact, that has been studied.\nThere's an excellent study\nthat was carried out not that\nlong ago on how stress itself\ncan increase our ability\nto focus and concentrate,\nthat's right how stress itself\ncan increase focus and concentration.\nYou know, most people think of stress\nas impairing our ability to focus,\nbut that's actually not true.\nWhen we are stressed, it\ninvolves the deployment,\nthe release of adrenaline, epinephrine,\nand that that adrenaline both\nchanges our visual field,\nin other words, it narrows our vision\nto a more tunnel-like focus,\nthat is it makes the arrow\nin our metaphor of the arrow more sharp,\nand it improves our concentration.\nAnd this makes sense given\nwhat we know about stress.\nWhen we're stressed,\nwe tend to be stressed\nabout a specific thing,\nwe start anticipating\nor wondering or thinking\nabout what's going to happen next?\nWhat led up to this?\nHow is this going to impact me?\nHow do I feel right now?\nIt really narrows the context\nof our thinking and our behavior.\nSo one of my favorite studies\nthat really illustrates\nhow stress can improve\nconcentration and performance\nis one that was published\nnot that long ago\nand I will provide a link\nto this in the show notes.\nIt's a paper published\nin the \"Journal of Experimental\nPsychology\" in 2020.\nThe title of the paper\nis, not surprisingly,\n\"Acute stress improves\nconcentration performance\",\nfirst author DeGroote, d-e-g-r-o-o-t-e.\nAnd this study involved\ntaking a number of subjects\nand stressing them out or not\nprior to a cognitive\nor concentration task.\nAnd there are a lot of data in this paper,\nbut I'm just going to hone in\non one specific set of data.\nAnd I should mention as I go there,\nthat they measured things like\ncortisol, a stress hormone,\nthey measured anxiety, it\nwas a quite thorough study.\nAnd what they found was that\nconcentration performance\nimproved manyfold, I should say, from,\nthere was a greater than doubling\nof concentration and\nperformance in the stress group.\nAnd stress in this context was provided\nusing a standard way of inducing stress.\nWhat they basically do\nis they bring subjects into the laboratory\nand they have to either do\nsomething fairly mundane\nin the control group\nor they have to do a\nsimulated job interview,\nan arithmetic task,\nand they're being evaluated\nas they're doing this.\nSo this isn't intense psychosocial stress.\nThey're not watching anything disturbing,\nthey're not being traumatized\nin any kind of way.\nThis is fairly low levels of stress\nthat raised their levels of epinephrine,\nand we know this from this study,\nand their levels of cortisol,\nanother stress hormone,\nmodestly within their brain and blood.\nBut that even modest increase\nin these stress hormones\nand their reported\npsychological levels of stress\nreally enhanced their\nfocus and concentration.\nThis may come as surprising\n'cause like many people think,\ngosh, stress really diminishes\ncognitive performance,\nbut that's absolutely wrong,\nstress improves cognitive performance.\nNow of course there are other\nways to increase stress levels\nand to do that in healthy ways\nto improve concentration and performance\nand one of the best ways to do that\nbecause it's so sure fire\nand it's generally safe\nprovided you do it safely\nis deliberate cold exposure.\nThis is something I've talked\nabout on the podcast before,\nbut deliberate cold\nexposure can be achieved\nby getting into a cold shower\nfor one to five minutes.\nIf you're not used to it,\nyou probably want to\nstart with one minute,\nor you can get into an ice bath,\nand nowadays there are\na number of different\ncommercial sources of\ncirculating cold water\nor if you have access\nto a body of cold water\nlike a lake or a pool or an ocean.\nWe know that getting into\ncold water or under cold water\ngreatly increases epinephrine\nlevels and dopamine levels\nin the brain and blood.\nThere's a beautiful\nstudy that was published\nin the European Journal of Physiology\nthat showed that the increases\nin dopamine are massive,\nnear doubling or more\nof dopamine levels that are\nvery long lasting for hours,\nand epinephrine, and\nindeed cortisol levels\nare also increased,\nand in ways that support\nnot just immune system\nfunction because they do that,\nand mood because it does that,\nbut they can really improve\nconcentration and focus.\nI touched on this a little\nbit in an episode about memory\nthat there's an age old practice\nreally dating back to medieval times\nof putting people into cold water\nright after they learn\nsomething in order to spike,\nto increase their epinephrine\nas a way to consolidate those memories.\nFor the sake of today's discussion,\nif you are interested\nin ways to improve\nfocus and concentration,\nyou need to increase your epinephrine,\nyour adrenaline levels.\nCold water exposure\nis one of the most\nefficient ways to do that.\nThis is not a biohack.\nI don't like the word hack,\nI know it's commonly used,\nbut a hack is something\nwhere you're using one thing\nfor a different purpose than\nit was originally intended for\nand here, I'm not referring\nto the shower or the cold bath,\nI'm referring to epinephrine.\nEpinephrine is a neurochemical\nthat will place your vision\ninto more of a tunnel mode,\nwhich will allow you to focus\non cognitive work or physical\nwork in a more specific way,\nyou're not going to be as distractable,\nand it's very easy to achieve\nby getting into a cold shower\nor a cold body of water\nfor a brief period of time.\nPeople always ask how long to\nget under or into cold water\nand how cold to make it.\nHere's the thing, it should\nbe uncomfortably cold,\nbut safe to stay in for\none to five minutes.\nOkay so uncomfortably cold,\nyou really want to get out,\nbut safe to stay in,\nnot so cold that it's going\nto give you a heart attack\nand not so warm that it's comfortable\nthat it doesn't create\nthat adrenaline release.\nCold water exposure,\nI should say deliberate, cold water\nor non deliberate cold water exposure\nreliably increases epinephrine levels.\nIt is incredibly useful\nas a tool for this,\nand it is in fact, zero cost\nor even negative zero cost.\nHow could it be negative zero cost?\nWell, you can certainly\nsave on your heating bill\nby taking a cold shower so that's one way.\nAnd for those of you that\nhave access to devices\nor locations where you\ncan get into cold water,\nyou can submerge,\nwell then that can work.\nFor those of you that don't,\nmaybe you take a cold bath,\nyou get in up to your neck,\nthat's going to be most efficient.\nFor those of you that can't do that,\nyou'll get under a cold shower.\nAgain, it should be comfortably cold\nto the point where you want to get out,\nbut that you can safely stay\nin for one to five minutes.\nHow long should you do\nit before a workout?\nWell, if you get into really cold water,\nit's uncomfortably cold\nand get out after about three minutes,\nyou're probably good to go,\ndry off and get to work.\nSome of you might think\nthis is a little bit silly\nas a tool for focus and concentration,\nbut if you look at the data on epinephrine\nand how powerfully it can increase focus,\nI think you'd be very impressed.\nI mean it certainly can\nincrease one's ability\nto attend to specific visual stimuli,\nso for reading or math work, et cetera,\nit's going to be very useful.\nAnd of course you don't\nwant to make it so cold\nthat you're shivering and\nchattering the whole time.\nAnd of course you could, if you like,\ncombine this with 40 HZ binaural beats,\nthere's no reason\nwhy you couldn't combine\nthe two protocols.\nBut the point here is that a\nlot of people would love to\nand I think ought to leverage\nthe health promoting and powerful effects\nof increasing epinephrine\non focusing concentration\nand running out and getting\nstressed by a life event\nor getting into an argument\nor something like that\nsimply as a way to increase\nfocus and concentration\ndoesn't seem that adaptive to me.\nSo deliberate cold exposure\nis a straightforward way to do that,\nit doesn't involve anyone else,\nI suppose you could do\nit with somebody else,\nbut it doesn't require anyone else.\nAnd again, there are zero low\nand even negative cost\nways to approach that.\nIf you'd like to know how long\nthe positive effects of epinephrine last\ntoward improving focus and concentration,\nwell, if we look to that\nstudy from DeGroote et al,\nthe acute stress improves\ncognitive performance study,\nthey measured concentration before\nand 30 minutes after\nthe stress was induced\nand there does appear to\nbe a quite long lasting,\nreally up to an hour or more effect\nof increasing epinephrine.\nSo how might you apply\nthese sorts of protocols\nearly in the day or later in the day?\nWell, one suggestion or one\npotential protocol would be\nif you're going to sit\ndown and do some work,\nif you're already feeling\nalert and focused,\nno need to reach to this tool,\nbut if you're feeling like\nyour focus and alertness\nisn't quite where you'd like it to be,\nyou could take a three\nminute very cold shower\nor submerge yourself in cold\nwater for three minutes,\nyou might have a cup of coffee as well\nand then sit down and do that work,\nmaybe even throw in the\n40 HZ binaural beats.\nAll of that would be layering\nin the different systems,\nthe different neurochemicals,\nsuch as acetylcholine,\nepinephrine and dopamine,\nthat are going to lend themselves\nto a really terrific 90\nminute or less work about.\nNow I'd like to discuss some\nof the purely behavioral tools\nthat quality peer reviewed science say\ncan improve focus and\nconcentration significantly.\nAt the beginning of today's episode,\nI talked about the study\nfrom Dr. Wendy Suzuki's lab\nwhere they explored a 13 minute meditation\ndone every day for a\nperiod of eight weeks.\nThat meditation led to\nsignificant improvements\nin focus and concentration ability,\nas well as other aspects\nof cognitive performance.\nIt also improved mood and reduced stress.\nSo you might be wondering what\nexactly is this meditation?\nThe meditation is very simple\nand it's one that anyone can perform.\nWhat you would want to do is set a timer\nfor about 13 minutes,\nI don't think it has to\nbe exactly 13 minutes,\nbut since that's what they\nincluded in the study,\nyou would set a timer for 13 minutes.\nYou would sit or lie\ndown, close your eyes,\nand you would simply\nfocus on your breathing.\nMost people are going to benefit\nfrom only doing that\nbreathing through their nose,\nbut if you have some sort of obstruction\nor inability to breathe\njust through your nose,\nyou could probably also do it\nby breathing through your nose\nand mouth or just your mouth.\nBut ideally you would\ndo just nasal breathing\nfor a period of 13 minutes,\nconcentrating on that breathing,\nand concentrating, meaning\nbringing your awareness,\nyour so-called interoceptive awareness\nif you wanted to get\nreally technical about it,\nyour interoceptive awareness\nto a point just about an\ninch inside of your forehead.\nNow, of course,\nthat might sound kind\nof gory to some of you,\nyou've never actually\nbeen inside your forehead,\nbut just about an inch\nbehind your forehead\nis where you would want to\nplace your concentration\nwhile also concentrating\non your breathing.\nNow here's the thing about meditation\nthat all studies of meditation show,\nwhich is that unless you are\na very experienced meditator,\nyour concentration, your focus\nwill drift away from your breathing\nand away from that location\nabout an inch inside your head,\ninside your brain, about\njust behind your forehead.\nThat will happen maybe every\n10 seconds, every 20 seconds,\nmaybe even every five seconds,\nbut an important part of\nsuch a meditation practice\nto improve concentration and focus\nis that you are continually refocusing\nback to that specific location\nand refocusing back on your breath.\nThis is something that again,\nis not often discussed.\nPeople think that if you do a meditation\nand you're supposed to\nconcentrate on your breath,\nthat if your mind drifts\nthat somehow you failed\nin that meditation,\nbut actually that's not the case.\nA huge component of improving your ability\nto focus and concentrate\nby way of neuroplasticity,\nrewiring of the circuits\nfor focus and concentration,\nis the repeated return to a state of focus\nfrom a state of non-focus\nor diminished focus.\nSo think about it like trying\nto drive down the freeway\nand staying between the\nlane lines, excuse me.\nAnd every once in a while,\nbecause there's a bit\nof drift on the vehicle,\nmaybe the wheels aren't aligned correctly\nor there's something else\nwrong with the chassis\nor the steering device,\nit starts to drift right a little bit,\nthen you hit the rumble strip to go rrrr,\nand then you pull back to the center.\nThat's really what a focused\nmeditation practice is about\nas opposed to expecting yourself\nto stay between the mental\nlane lines, so to speak.\nSo if you're somebody who's\ngoing to do a practice\nof the sort that I described,\n13 minute meditation practice every day,\nyou'd want to sit or lie\ndown, close your eyes,\nstart to concentrate on your breath,\nfocus your attention\non a location about an\ninch behind your forehead,\nand then fully expect that at some point,\nyou'll be thinking about something else,\nand that's a cue to focus\nback to that location\njust about an inch behind your forehead\nand back to your breath.\nBy doing that repeatedly over and over,\nwhat you're really training up\nis the network within your brain\nthat indeed includes\nthat prefrontal cortex\nthat you're focusing on as\nwell as some other structures,\nthe inferior temporal cortex,\nindeed the hippocampus,\na structure associated with memory,\nand other components of the neural circuit\nthat are involved in directing\nour mental focus and concentration.\nAgain, I can't emphasize the importance\nof this practice being one\nof focusing and refocusing.\nIn fact, I would prefer\nto call such a practice,\na refocus focused meditation,\nor a constantly refocusing,\nor maybe you all can come up\nwith a better name for it,\nI'm certainly not that\ngood at naming things,\nbut this sort of meditation practice\nhas been shown\nin the study by the Suzuki\nlab and other studies\nto really improve people's ability\nto focus and remain focused,\nso much so that in the beautiful\nbook, \"Altered States,\"\nthey describe a number of\ndifferent meditation practices,\nsome a little bit longer than\nthe one that I described,\none that's 17 minutes,\nanother one that's 30 minutes,\nsome people will meditate\nas long as 60 minutes a day,\nalthough that's quite a\nlong time, in my opinion.\nThe point here isn't how long you focus\nor somehow trying to achieve total focus\nfor the entire 13 minute or 17 minute\nor 60 minute about of meditation.\nWhile that would be wonderful\nand I think many people aspire to do that,\nthat's a lot of hard mental work.\nI think for most people out\nthere, including myself,\na relatively short meditation\npractice of about 13 minutes\nin which you fully expect\nyour focus and concentration to drift,\nbut that you are continually refocusing\nis going to be the most effective,\nyes, indeed, the most effective\nat teaching yourself to\nfocus and stay concentrated.\nIn fact, I invite you to interpret\nevery time that you\nfocus off that location\nabout one inch behind your forehead,\nas an opportunity to refocus\nand think about the\nrefocusing as the trigger\nfor teaching your neural circuits\nhow to focus for extended periods of time.\nAnd as a bonus to that sort\nof meditation practice,\nthe study from Wendy Suzuki's lab\nalso showed that people\nexperience improvements in sleep\nand improvements in memory,\nso not just improvements in\nmood and reduction in stress\nand improvements in\nfocus and concentration,\nbut all these other positive benefits\nfrom just doing that 13 minute\na day meditation practice.\nIt's one that I've started to adopt\nand have felt tremendous benefit from\nand that I encourage many\nof you to try as well.\nThe one cautionary note\nis the one that I mentioned at\nthe beginning of the episode,\nwhich is because the refocus\nas I'll call it, meditation,\ndoes involve a significant\namount of effort\nand engagement of these\nprefrontal cortical circuits,\nit is disruptive to sleep if\nperformed too closely to sleep.\nSo if you are going to do that practice,\nI recommend that you not do it\nwithin the four hours\nprior to your bedtime.\nEarlier I mentioned\nthat I would talk about\nways to improve focus\nif you are sleep deprived.\nThis is something that\nI'm all too familiar with.\nI put a lot of effort\ninto optimizing my sleep,\nthat's something that\nwith each passing year,\nI put more and more effort into,\nagain, because sleep is so vital\nfor mental health, physical health\nand performance of all kinds,\nbut certainly in my role as a student,\nin my role as a professor\nand in my role in life,\nI've had numerous times\nin which I simply did not get enough sleep\nor my sleep was terrible\nfor whatever reason,\nand yet I still had work\ndemands and social demands,\net cetera.\nOne practice that is very effective\nat allowing you to focus\nbetter than you would otherwise\nunder conditions of sleep deprivation\nis so called non-sleep deep rest or NSDR.\nThis is also referred to\nsometimes as yoga nidra.\nYoga nidra actually means yoga sleep.\nYoga nidra is a practice of\nlying down for about 10 to 30\nsometimes even as long as 60 minutes,\nyou listen to a script,\nit's an audio script,\nthat takes you through a\nprogressive deep relaxation,\nit involves a body scan,\nsome long exhale breathing.\nIt is very restorative in the\nsense that one tends to emerge\nfrom yoga nidra or NSDR\nfeeling greatly refreshed\ncompared to how you felt prior to it.\nThere is also terrific neuroimaging data\nfrom laboratories in Denmark\nshowing that there's a\nrestoration of dopamine levels\nin the so-called basal ganglia\nafter NSDR AKA yoga nidra.\nWhether or not you call\nit yoga nidra or NSDR,\nwhich is what I refer to\nit as, non-sleep deep rest,\nyou can find these scripts at\nzero cost in multiple places.\nYou can find there are\ncertain apps that are NSDR\nor yoga nidra apps.\nThere is a NSDR protocol\nthat was put out there by\nMadefor which is on YouTube\nthat you can access for free.\nThere is a NSDR or I should\nsay a number of NSDR protocols\nthrough the Virtusan app.\nThere are, again, number\nof different places\nthat one can access NSDR protocols.\nI do NSDR for 10 to 30 minutes\nper day every single day,\nnot just on days where I'm sleep deprived.\nIf I happen to be sleep deprived,\nI would extend that NSDR\nto 30 or 60 minutes.\nAnd when you do that NSDR\nwill depend on when you\nhave time for that NSDR.\nWhen I haven't slept well,\nwhat I'll try and do is find a quiet place\nwhere I can do NSDR for\n30 or ideally 60 minutes.\nSometimes I will fall back\nasleep during that NSDR,\nthat's fine if you do that,\nbut most people will stay\nawake during the NSDR,\nand then I'll emerge from\nthat and go about my day.\nIf in the afternoon,\nI'm very fatigued\nbecause of lack of sleep,\nI might do another NSDR\nof 10 to 30 or 60 minutes,\nand then another work about.\nAgain, NSDR is something I do every day.\nI talked a lot about this in\nthe episodes related to sleep,\nbecause it can help you get better\nat falling and staying asleep at night\nin addition to feeling restorative\nin that immediate timeframe of the day\nin which you do NSDR,\nso it's immensely\nbeneficial at various times\nand for various purposes.\nBut here within the context\nof trying to concentrate and focus\nwhen you're sleep deprived,\nNSDR, AKA yoga nidra is an\nimmensely beneficial practice.\nThere's growing amounts of quality science\npointing to the neurochemical\nreplenishing effects,\nas I mentioned before, dopamine,\nbut also the potential for NSDR\nto replace sleep that you've lost.\nI would never want anyone\nto try and use NSDR\nas a total replacement for sleep,\nbut under conditions in which\nyou cannot control your sleep,\nNSDR is going to be the\nbest way that I am aware of\nto restore your ability\nto focus and concentrate\nfor whatever purpose.\nAnd if you emerge from your NSDR\nand then drink some caffeine,\nyou'll notice an even greater capacity\nfor focus and concentration\nfor all the reasons directly\nrelated to caffeine.\nSo again, NSDR is a general tool\nfor enhancing your ability to sleep\nand it's a tool that you can use\nin order to compensate for,\nat least to some degree,\ncompensate for lost sleep\nwhen you need to focus and concentrate.\nOne thing that really\ncontrasts NSDR and yoga nidra\nwith the sort of focused meditation\nthat I talked about a few minutes ago,\nthe 13 minute meditation,\nis that during the 13 minute meditation,\nyou're actively trying\nto refocus and focus,\nwhereas during NSDR and yoga nidra,\nyou're actually trying to defocus.\nSo you can think of the\n13 minute meditation\nfor refocusing and focusing\nas directly tapping into and mediating\nimprovements in the circuitry\nfor focus and concentration\nwhereas you can think\nof NSDR and yoga nidra\nas modulating your brain and body state\nto allow you to focus\nand concentrate better.\nNow another tool that you can use\nto directly tap in\nto the circuits for\nfocus and concentration\nand to greatly accelerate\nneuroplasticity, the improvements,\nor I should say the\nchanges in those circuits\nthat will allow you to\nfocus and concentrate better\nis hypnosis.\nA lot of people hear hypnosis\nand they think stage hypnosis,\nyou know, people squawking like chickens\nand doing things against their will,\nbut actually hypnosis is a atypical\nbut highly accessible brain state\nthat's been studied with a lot of rigor\nat Stanford University School of Medicine\nby my colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,\nhe's been a guest on\nthis podcast previously.\nHypnosis is a unique brain state\nbecause it's one in which\nyou are deeply focused\nand yet deeply relaxed.\nSo to just sort of set up\nthe array of practices here\nso you can think about them logically,\nthe focus refocus meditation\nis based on and focused\non focus, no pun intended.\nNSDR and yoga nidra are\naimed at deep relaxation.\nHypnosis is this atypical,\nvery powerful brain state\nin which you combine high levels of focus\nand deep relaxation.\nNow it's a little bit of a tough one\nto just take oneself into,\nbut fortunately, there's a tool\nbased on a lot of quality\npeer-reviewed research\nfrom the Spiegel lab and other labs\nand that is the Reveri app, r-e-v-e-r-i.\nThe Reveri app is available for no cost,\nat least for a period of time\nand then I think they place\ncertain elements of it\nbehind a pay wall,\nbut you can try at zero cost,\nit's available for Apple,\nsoon I think also to be\navailable for Android,\nand they have specific hypnosis protocols\nthat you listen to, and these\nare very brief protocols,\nfollow the instructions,\nyou're listening to a\nparticular audio script\nof David Spiegel himself,\nand some progressive breathing\nand actually some eye movements\nthat are directly linked\nto the neural circuits\nthat allow for these highly\nfocused, deeply relaxed states.\nAnd there are components\nwithin the Reveri app\nspecifically geared\ntowards improving focus and concentration.\nSo again,\nthere's meditation for focus,\nthere's deliberate\ndecompression, NSDR, yoga nidra,\nwhich take you into deep relaxation,\nand then hypnosis is this very\nspecial, very directed state\nof highly focused and highly relaxed,\nor I should say deeply relaxed,\nthat allow access to the neural circuits\nfor focus and concentration\nand allow you to tune those\nup and to improve those\nvery significantly in a\nvery brief amount of time.\nAnd again, some of those hypnosis scripts\nare as short as eight minutes,\nsome are as long as 13 minutes.\nSo what we're really talking\nabout here are zero cost tools\nthat directly tap into\nthe neural circuits,\nthe components within your brain,\nthat allow for deep relaxation,\nallow for deep focus,\nand improve your ability to\nfocus and concentrate over time\nsimply by repeating these.\nHow often do you need to\nrepeat the Reveri hypnosis\nfor focus and concentration\nbefore you see benefits?\nWell, that will vary\nfrom person to person.\nI tend to use it once\nevery third or fourth day\nand have experienced\ntremendous benefits from it.\nI don't think I'm unique in that sense,\nthey have a lot of data\nto support this Reveri app\nand the protocols within it.\nHow long do you have to do NSDR\nbefore you experience those benefits?\nThere, I would say the\nfirst time and every time,\nbecause it's so deeply relaxing\nthat you emerge from it\nfeeling quite restored\nrelative to how you went into it.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier\nin the study on meditation,\nit took about eight weeks\nto see the effects that\nthey observed in that study,\nbut they didn't observe\nshorter time points.\nSo I highly encourage\npeople to explore meditation\ngeared towards focus and refocus,\nalso NSDR, nonsleep deep\nrest, AKA yoga nidra,\nand the Reveri app,\nSpecifically the hypnosis\nwithin the Reveri app,\nthat's geared towards improving\nfocus and concentration.\nAll of these have terrific\nscience to support them,\nthis is not woo science or hacks\nor just something that\npeople came up with.\nThis is all grounded in work\nfrom some of the best\nuniversities in the world,\nfrom excellent groups\nwho've looked at underlying\nneural mechanisms\nand measured things with a lot of rigor,\net cetera, et cetera.\nThese tools are available to you,\nI highly recommend that you use them.\nAnd if you're interested\nin the optimal time of day to do these,\nwe already mentioned that\nthe focus refocus meditation\nshouldn't be done too close to sleep,\nthe Reveri hypnosis app can\nbe done at any time really,\nin fact, there's a component\nof falling back of sleep in there,\nin other words, a hypnosis\nspecifically geared\ntoward helping people teach\nthemselves to fall back asleep\nwhen they wake up in\nthe middle of the night.\nNSDR, I always say,\ncan be done first thing in\nthe morning, in the afternoon\nor any time of day,\nand in fact,\nI'll sometimes do that in\nthe middle of the night\nif I happen to wake up and\nneed to get back to sleep.\nSo really these tools can be\napplied most any time of day,\nexcept for that one caveat\nabout the focus refocus meditation\nnot being done too close to sleep.\nNow there's another\nset of behavioral tools\nthat can really help enhance\none's ability to focus\nand those are visual based tools.\nIn fact, the tools I'm about to describe\nare actually being employed\nin a number of schools\nin China and elsewhere in\norder to teach children\nto focus better and for\nlonger periods of time.\nThe key principle here is that\nmuch of our cognitive focus,\nour ability to think about\nsomething in a very specific way\nand stay focused on it,\nto read or to follow\na line of conversation\nor math or music, et cetera,\nis going to be directed\nby our visual system.\nOur visual system has two\nforms of attention and focus.\nOne is overt focus, which\nis very straightforward.\nIf I'm looking at the tip of my pen,\nfor those of who are listening right now,\nI'm looking at the tip of\nmy pen, that's overt focus,\nI'm focusing on it with my eyes,\nand of course, the rest of\nmy brain then will follow\nand start to analyze the\ndetails of what I'm seeing\nand the contours of the pen, et cetera.\nIt seems sort of obvious\nwhen you first hear it,\nbut our cognitive focus tends to follow\nour overt visual focus.\nThat's also why they\nput blinders on horses.\nThat's also why sometimes\nwearing a hoodie or a hat\nor limiting your visual field in some way\ncan help you enhance your cognitive focus,\nit can help limit distraction.\nYou're just not seeing as much.\nIt's also why when we ingest caffeine\nor any kind of stimulant\nor we are stressed\nand our pupils dilate\nand our vision becomes more tunnel-like,\nless panoramic, but more tunnel-like,\nyou know they say a soda\nstraw view of the world\nor you're looking through a tunnel,\nyour focus, your visual focus\nis actually driving your cognitive focus.\nYour cognitive focus is\nnarrower than it would be\nif you were seeing the\nwhole scene that you're in.\nSo when you hear this, it sounds obvious,\nbut for many people,\nincluding many scientists,\nit's just not obvious that\nthis would be the case.\nHowever, that is the case,\nyour visual focus drives\nyour cognitive focus.\nSo what is a practice\nthat has been studied\nin various laboratories\nand that's being employed\nin various schools?\nIs to have children or adults\nvisually focus on one location\nfor a given period of time.\nHow long?\nAnywhere from 30 seconds to three minutes,\nand believe it or not,\nthree minutes is a long time\nto maintain visual focus at one location.\nIf you were to try that right now,\nyou'd probably find it\nto be a bit of a strain,\nbut if you want to try it, you can.\nKeep in mind, you yes,\nare allowed to blink,\nbut also keep in mind that\nmeditation refocusing practice\nthat we talked about earlier,\nthat the refocusing is the key component\nof teaching yourself or your brain,\nyou are your brain, your brain is you,\nbut to teach yourself how to focus better.\nSo if you're going to\nincorporate this practice,\nwhat you would want to\ndo is pick a location,\nit could be on a wall,\nit could be on your\ncomputer in front of you,\nalthough I would encourage it\nto not be the contents\nof your computer screen,\nyou might just want to blank your screen,\nyou might want to put a piece of paper\nwith a crosshatch there,\nany sort of visual target,\nor you can imagine a visual target\nand then focus your visual\nattention on that target\nand try to breathe normally,\ntry and stay relaxed,\nand certainly allow yourself to blink\nso that your eyes don't try out.\nThis is not a test of how long\nyou can go without blinking.\nBy focusing on that particular location\nand by forcing yourself to\nrefocus on that location\nanytime your gaze, your vision\ndrifts from that location,\nyou are encouraging the circuits for focus\nto get better at focusing\nfor longer and longer\nand at refocusing when your focus\ndrifts off of that location.\nThis is incorporating neural circuits,\nincluding the prefrontal cortex,\nthings like the frontal eye fields.\nFor those of you curious\nabout the underlying biology,\nthis practice is\nrecruiting certain elements\nof your so-called prefrontal cortex,\nalso the frontal eye fields,\nwhich are locations not far\nfrom the prefrontal cortex,\nthat are involved in\ndeliberately directing your gaze\nto particular locations in space,\nnot outer space,\nalthough you could do this by\nfocusing on stars I suppose,\nbut in visual space.\nNow I mentioned before\nthat this is overt visual\nfocus and attention,\nyou are overtly looking at that location,\nbut one also very powerful practice\nfor improving focus and concentration\nis to use covert focus.\nCovert focus is where my gaze,\nmy eyes are focused on one\nlocation, such as my pen,\nbut my focus is actually directed\nelsewhere in the room\nor location that I'm in.\nMy mind and to some extent\nmy peripheral vision\nis focused in this case on\nthe door just to my left\nin the room that I'm in.\nThat takes a little bit more effort.\nThis is something that\nall old world primates,\nof which we are old world\nprimates, are able to do.\nAnd it probably evolved\nas part of the mechanism\nby which animals could\nevaluate their scene,\nevaluate predators,\nevaluate other primates\nwhile not necessarily\nstaring at them directly\nso they can obtain information,\nwe can obtain information\nwithout having to direct our gaze\nspecifically to one location.\nMaybe we can obtain information\nfrom multiple locations,\nindeed, we can.\nWithout getting too far\ndown the rabbit hole\nof how vision and cognition relate,\nbecause we've done episodes\non that previously,\nand simply focusing on the\ntools that can be incorporated\nto improve focus and concentration,\nhere's what I recommend.\nSet yourself a low bar\nat first and set a timer\nand try to focus on one\nlocation for 30 seconds\nand that's it for that day.\nThe next day, you might add five seconds,\nand then the next day,\nfive seconds after that.\nIf you miss a day, no big deal,\nsimply do the practice for\nthe same amount of time\nthat you did the last time\nthat you did the practice,\nand then gradually try and\nincrease the amount of time\nthat you can focus on one\nvisual location overtly\nby looking directly at that location.\nIf you like, and if you\nfeel you have the ability,\nyou can try and do this through\ncovert attention and focus\nby looking straight forward for instance,\nand attending to something\nin the corner of the room\nand trying to do that for 30 seconds,\nyou'll find that that's\nquite a bit harder,\nand then extending that by five seconds\nevery time you do the practice.\nThis is something that I\ndon't think you necessarily\nhave to build up to being\nable to do for a full hour\nin order to extract the benefits.\nIn fact, the best way to\nthink about this practice\nis as a means to get into a focused state.\nIf you remember back\nabout an hour or so ago,\nI was talking about how focused states\nare not a drop all the way in\nand then exit type phenomenon.\nWe don't just drop into a focused state\nthe same way we don't drop\ninto the peak performance\nof a workout, we warm up.\nSo what I recommend is having a 30 second\nto three minute period at the\nbeginning of a about to focus\nwhere you're going to\ndo work or physical work\nand anchoring your vision to one location\nsomewhere in the room\nor if you want to do it\ncovertly, you can do that,\nsetting a timer and trying to do that\nfor anywhere from 30\nseconds to three minutes.\nWhat you're doing when\nyou exercise that practice\nis you are ramping up neural activity\nwithin the neural circuits\nthat create focus and concentration.\nThen, I would stop\nlooking at that location\nor that covert location\nand then I would move to the\nwork that you're trying to do,\neither mental work or physical work.\nAnd if about halfway\nthrough your 90 minute about\nor at some point in your 90\nminute about of work or exercise,\nyou feel that your\nconcentration is drifting\nrather than look at your phone\nand scroll through the\nthousands of contexts\nthat exists within social\nmedia or your phone,\ntry just picking a\nlocation again on the wall,\nfocusing back on that location,\nusing that as a ramp up\nto then direct your focus back towards,\nif your weight training,\nsets and reps that you\nmight be performing,\nif you're running,\nyou might do this, or\ncycling you might do this\nby focusing on a particular location\nand really homing in on\nthat location physically.\nAnd this is a practice that a\nlot of athletes use in fact,\nand if you're say doing\nmusical practice or math,\nwell then, you'd want\nto focus on something\nother than the task that\nyou're trying to perform.\nBut again, using visual focus\nas a way to ramp up and\nincrease your overall ability\nto focus and concentrate,\nand then applying that to whatever it is\nthat you're trying to learn or perform.\nNext, I'd like to talk about compounds\nthat can improve concentration and focus,\nand these are most often\nconsumed as supplements,\nalthough some of them, I should mention,\ncan also be derived from food.\nAgain, I just want to remind you\nthat there are things,\nin this case compounds,\nthat can modulate a biological mechanism,\nthat is can modulate\nfocus and concentration,\nand there are compounds that can mediate,\ncan directly contribute to\nconcentration and focus.\nOne of the key compounds\nthat supports concentration and focus\nbecause it generally supports\nmood, concentration and focus\nand brain function in general\nare the omega-3 essential fatty acids.\nI've talked about the\nomega-3 essential fatty acids\nin a variety of contexts,\nin particular depression,\nbut also ADHD, there are\ninteresting data on that,\nand it's really clear\nthat getting somewhere between\none and three grams of EPA,\nthat is one to three grams\nof EPA essential fatty acid\nper day can improve outcomes,\nthat is can improve mood and\ncan improve cognitive function.\nAnd while there's some debate\nabout whether or not it can\nimprove cardiac function,\nit's very clear, at least to me,\nthat ingesting one to three grams\nof EPA essential fatty\nacid per day is beneficial.\nBut again, in the context\nof focus and concentration,\nit's in modulating the neural\ncircuits and brain function\nthat are going to support\nfocus and concentration.\nIt's not as if taking one to three grams\nof EPA essential fatty acid per day\nis going to tap directly into\nonly the circuits for\nfocus and concentration.\nThat said, and as discussed on the episode\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwith Dr. Rhonda Patrick,\nand on the episode on ADHD that I did,\nand on the episode on\ndepression that I did,\nI make it a point to\ningest one to three grams\nof EPAs per day.\nYou can get those EPAs\nfrom other sources besides\nsupplements, of course,\nbut supplements are going to\nbe the easiest way to do that.\nYou could do that through liquid form,\nfish oil, cod liver oil,\nsome people who are vegan opt\nfor other sources of EPAs,\nyou can find those out there certainly.\nSome people even use prescription EPAs\nto get the dosage really high.\nDr. Ronda Patrick talked about\nthis in the episode with me,\nthat's actually something that she does.\nI don't take the prescription form,\nI get them through pill form\nthrough our supplement\naffiliate, which is Momentous,\nbut there are a number of\ndifferent quality sources\nof EPAs out there.\nAnd some of those quality\nsources also include things\nlike fatty fish, algae,\nand things of that sort.\nSo I'll leave it to you as to\nwhether or not you supplement\nwith omega-3 fatty acids\nin order to get that one\nto three grams per day\nor whether or not you do it through food,\nbut I would encourage you to\ntry and reach that threshold\nbecause there are a number\nof known positive effects\nfor mood and brain function generally.\nThe other thing that can\npositively modulate brain function\nand that actually works as a\nfuel for neurons to function\nand can improve cognitive performance,\nand particularly within\nthe brain circuits,\nsuch as the prefrontal cortex,\nthat are involved in concentration\nand focus is creatine.\nI know many people are familiar\nwith creatine monohydrate\nfor its effects on muscle growth\nand strength and performance,\nbut it's quite clear that the\nbulk of scientific studies\nhave examined the role of\ncreatine in the clinical context\nand as its role in improving\ncognitive performance.\nSo my read of the literature\nhas led to a practice\nin which I ingest five grams per day\nof creatine monohydrate,\nthe sort of standard\nform that's available in,\nthis is generally available as a powder,\nthat's certainly how I take it.\nI'll take the creatine powder,\nI'll mix it with water or\nwith my Athletic Greens\nor some sort of electrolyte drink,\nwhatever liquid happens to be\nconvenient to ingest that in,\nthe time of day doesn't\nreally seem to be important.\nSome people are strong believers\nin consuming creatine post-workout.\nWhile that might be beneficial,\nI simply take it in the\nmorning or post-workout,\nit sort of depends on when\nI remember to take it,\nbut that five grams of creatine per day,\nin my case, really isn't\ngeared towards muscle growth\nor strength or performance\nas much as it's geared toward\ntapping into the creatine\nphosphate system within the brain\nand specifically the benefits of creatine\nfor prefrontal cortical\nnetworks, again, modulating,\nnot directly mediating,\nbut modulating and generally supporting\nthe brain networks that\nare going to allow me\nto generate focus and concentration.\nSo much like sleep, much\nlike omega-3 fatty acids,\ncreatine monohydrate five grams a day\nseems to generally support brain function,\nwhich will generally support\nconcentration and focus.\nNow in terms of compounds\nthat more specifically mediate\nconcentration and focus,\nwe have to go back to\nthat arrow metaphor model\nthat we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nthat included epinephrine,\nadrenaline, acetylcholine,\nwhich acts as this attentional spotlight,\nin fact, acetylcholine and\nelevated levels of acetylcholine\nhave been shown over and over again\nthrough beautiful work from\nMike Merzenich's lab at UCSF\nand the Kilgard Lab down in Houston,\nand a number of other labs,\nincluding Norm Weinberger's\nlab at UC Irvine,\nagain and again,\nto improve or even directly\ngate neuroplasticity\nby increasing focus directly.\nThat's a lot of word soup,\nbut basically what happens is\nif acetylcholine transmission\nis increased even\ntransiently within the brain,\nthere's a greater opportunity\nfor neuroplasticity to take place.\nAnd the reason there's\na greater opportunity\nfor neuroplasticity, AKA\nlearning to take place,\nis by way of the increased focus\nthat spiking acetylcholine can provide.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nthere are a number of different\nfoods which contain choline,\nyou can look those up online,\ncholine acting as an amino acid\nprecursor to acetylcholine,\nbut of course, there are\ncompounds, there are supplements\nthat can further and more\nacutely increase acetylcholine,\nand indeed, I use these myself.\nThe most effective one\nI've found is Alpha-GPC.\nAlpha-GPC consumed at dosages\nof 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams\nprior to a work about\nor prior to a workout\ngreatly increase one's ability\nto focus and concentrate,\nat least that's been my experience,\nand there are some good data in humans.\nSo how would I use Alpha-GPC?\nI would use Alpha-GPC by taking\nit about 10 to 20 minutes\nprior to any time I want to focus\nor concentrate very deeply.\nI've taken as much as 600\nmilligrams at one time,\nalthough I find that 300\nmilligrams is enough for me,\nand I tend to be quite\nsensitive to supplements\nand caffeine in general,\nso I'll sometimes take\nit alongside yerba mate\nor with yerba mate or with\ncoffee prior to a workout\nor prior to a about of work\nin which I'm focusing on mental work.\nSo it could be reading, writing,\ncould be math, could be data analysis,\ncould be anything\nwhere I need a lot of\nfocus and concentration.\nNow a number of people have contacted me\nabout a recent study\nsuggesting that Alpha-GPC\nwhen taken chronically over many years\ncould increase one's\nvulnerability to stroke.\nI've looked at those data\nand my read of the data\nis that they're not very conclusive,\nalthough anytime you\nsee something like that,\na study that's pointing to the fact\nthat a given compound\nmight increase the propensity for stroke,\nyou obviously want to be concerned.\nSo we have to ask ourselves\nhow, by what mechanism that is,\ncould Alpha-GPC be increasing\nthe susceptibility to stroke?\nAnd it seems to be related\nto increases in TMAO,\nwhich is a marker related to\nthe cardiovascular system.\nAnd one known way to\noffset increases in TMAO\nthat are associated either with Alpha-GPC\nor increases due to other things,\nso ingestion of particular food compounds\nactually can increase TMAO,\nis to offset that by taking\n600 milligrams of garlic.\nNow I've been taking Alpha-GPC\npretty consistently for a number of years.\nI do not take it every day.\nI would say I take it\nabout four days per week,\nagain, prior to workouts\nor bouts of cognitive work.\nI have not seen my TMAO spike\nand I've evaluated that\nby way of blood tests,\nbut nonetheless, I take\n600 milligrams of garlic\nin capsule form anytime I eat anyway\nand I do that for general\ncardiovascular function\nand there's some interesting data\non immune system function,\net cetera for garlic.\nSo I've been consuming 600\nmilligram capsules of garlic\nfor some period of time.\nSome days, I'll ingest just\none 600 milligram capsule,\nother times, I'll take two,\nbut based on this recent study\nand the concerns about TMAO,\nI make it a point\nto always ingest a 600\nmilligram capsule of garlic\nanytime I take Alpha-GPC,\nwhich again for me is\nabout four days per week.\nSo in our model of attention and focus,\nyou can now clearly see\nwhy taking Alpha-GPC,\nwhich increases acetylcholine transmission\nwould be beneficial for\nconcentration and focus\nand why taking it with a double espresso\nor why taking it with yerba mate\nwould further increase\nconcentration and focus\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\ncaffeine is going to increase epinephrine.\nIt's also going to increase the density\nof dopamine receptors\nand the Alpha-GPC is going\nto increase acetylcholine,\nthis spotlighting for cognition,\nthis ability to really\namplify the activity\nof specific neural networks,\nwhich is largely what's happening\nwhen you're trying to focus\nand pay attention to\nsomething specifically.\nSo if one wants to increase\nthe amount of dopamine\ntransmission in the brain and body\nfor sake of increasing\nconcentration and focus,\none of the most efficient ways to do that\nis by ingestion of the\namino acid L-tyrosine.\nAgain, L-tyrosine can be\nderived from food sources,\nI invite you to look up\nthose various food sources on the web,\nsimply go to a web browser and put in\nfoods that contain a lot of L-tyrosine\nand you'll get a rich array\nof choices to select from.\nBut in my case, I use\nL-tyrosine in capsule form.\nI will take 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,\n300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC\nand a cup of coffee.\nI'm careful to do this early in the day,\ncertainly not after two or 3:00 PM\nbecause I don't want\nto diminish my ability\nto fall and stay asleep that night.\nI'll do this early in\nthe day before a workout\nor before a about of\nconcentrated mental work.\nAgain, I tend to do this\nabout four days per week,\nso certainly not every\ntime I sit down to do work.\nAnd I should also mention\nthat I still tend to do\nthe behavioral tools.\nI'll tend to use five\nminutes of binaural beats\nor binaural beats\nthroughout the work session,\nsometimes do a ice bath\nor a cold shower before.\nI don't want to give the impression\nthat I combine every tool\nthat I've talked about today\nfor a given workout.\nI mean, that would be pretty\nwild to take a cold shower,\npop an L-tyrosine, take an Alpha-GPC,\ndrink two espresso,\nlisten to binaural beats.\nThat to me seems like\na very inefficient way\nto go about life.\nIn fact, I make it a\npoint to try and use tools\nto increase my ability\nto concentrate and focus,\nbut not to combine more\nthan two or three of them\nat any one time.\nAnd when I say two or three,\nwhat I mean is I will use\nsupplements like Alpha-GPC,\nL-Tyrosine and caffeine together\nbefore certain work bouts,\nI might use the visual practice\nof focusing on a given\nlocation for a minute\nbefore I begin that work about,\nI might combine those.\nThen another time I\nmight take a cold shower\nprior to doing some work.\nOther days, I confess,\nI've slept very well\nor my enthusiasm about what\nI'm about to work on is such\nthat I don't require any of these tools.\nAgain, there's no requirement,\nthere's no pressure to\nuse any of these tools,\nbehavioral, supplement based or otherwise.\nIt's simply a matter of using the tools\nthat are going to allow you\nto achieve the states you want to achieve\nand to improve your ability\nto go into those states\nwithout any help at all.\nAnd this is what I find\nparticularly attractive about supplements.\nIt's not so much that they put you\ninto the ideal state for that work\nand then you accomplish that work\nand then you always rely\non those supplements.\nI prefer to look at supplements\nof the sort that I just described\nas a route into a deeper trench\nof focus and concentration\nthat I use as a tool to teach myself\nto focus and concentrate more deeply,\nsuch that I don't need those tools\nevery single time I try\nand focus and concentrate.\nI think this is an important point\nbecause I think that many\npeople think of supplements\nas a crutch or a way of\nsimply getting into a state\nfor which no other tool\nwill suffice or replace.\nBut in that context,\nI want to remind you of the\nlarger context of pharmacology,\nwhich is the vast landscape\nof prescription pharmacology for ADHD,\nfor attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder.\nNow I covered that\nlandscape in intense detail\non the episode on ADHD and focus.\nAnd just to summarize, there is of course,\nAdderall, Ritalin, Vyvanse,\nModafinil, Armodafinil,\na number of different compounds,\nall of which generally\nincrease dopamine transmission\nin the brain, so increasing dopamine,\nand all of which generally\nincrease epinephrine,\nadrenaline transmission\nin the brain and body.\nAnd many of those compounds\nhave been of tremendous benefit\nto children and even some\nadults who suffer from ADHD.\nSo properly prescribed at\nthe appropriate dosage,\nthose compounds can really help people\nwith clinically diagnosed ADHD.\nThe way they help those people\nis a bit surprising, however.\nYou might think, well they\nturn on the brain chemicals\nthat allow those people\nto concentrate and focus.\nThat's true,\nbut they also have the benefit\nof teaching those brain\ncircuits how to engage.\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwhy somewhat paradoxically\ngiving a stimulant like\nRitalin or Adderall\nto a kid that legitimately needs it,\nobviously, you don't want to\ndo this without the oversight\nand careful evaluation of a psychiatrist,\nbut giving that to a\nkid who has severe ADHD,\nyou would think would make\nthem more rambunctious,\nless able to focus and\nmore distractible overall.\nAfter all, Ritalin,\nModafinil, Armodafinil,\nall these things are stimulants.\nSo you take a kid\nwho has attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder\nand give them these drugs\nthat increase transmission\nof dopamine and epinephrine\nand you think, wow,\nit's going to make them\neven more distractible and hyperactive\nand indeed, it has the opposite effect.\nIt doesn't necessarily\nmake them feel calm,\nbut it makes them feel\nthat they can focus,\nthey really can anchor their attention.\nAnd the idea is that it's\nteaching those neural circuits\nor those neural circuits\nrather are teaching themselves\nto engage and to focus and concentrate.\nAnd the ideal situation is one in which\nthe total dosage of those\ncompounds, those drugs,\ncan be reduced over time\nas those circuits learn to come online\nthrough purely behavioral tools.\nNow oftentimes, there's a\nmaintenance of those drugs\nover long periods of time,\nalthough there is a\ncommon practice nowadays\nof trying to diminish the dosage overall.\nThat's in the context of ADHD\nand prescription medication\nand I acknowledge that a lot,\nindeed 80% or more of college\nstudents say the statistics\nare using prescription drugs\nwhen they are not in fact\nprescribed those prescription drugs.\nSo basically what I'm saying\nis there are a lot of people using drugs\ndesigned for ADHD and narcolepsy\nbecause those drugs\nwill effectively increase\nfocus and concentration,\nbut I strongly discourage\nthe use of powerful prescription drugs\nthat have not been prescribed to you.\nFirst of all, it's illegal.\nSecond of all, it's quite dangerous\nto hit the accelerator\nof those neural circuits\nwith such vigor\nbecause it can increase dependency\nand they can have a number\nof other side effects\noutside the context of\nclinically diagnosed\nand prescribed ADHD medication.\nBut in the context of supplementation,\nthe increase in dopamine,\nacetylcholine and epinephrine\nthat one can achieve from say\n500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,\n300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC\nand a cup of coffee\nis going to be substantially less\nthan one would see for prescription drugs.\nSo you're getting a modest effect\nthat can similarly teach\nthose brain circuits\nfor focus and concentration\nhow to engage better.\nBut as a general backdrop to all of this,\nI always say and I'll\nsay it again and again\nprobably until the day I die,\nwhich hopefully is a long time from now,\nbut regardless, it'll be the same message,\nI always believe that behavioral\ntools should come first,\nbehavioral tools should come first.\nThen focus on nutrition.\nIn fact, I would say\nbehavioral and nutrition tools,\nand of course, get excellent sleep.\nThen focus on supplementation and then,\nand only if those are failing\nto bring your brain and body\nto the state you need to be in\nto perform well in school\nand work and life, et cetera\ndo I recommend that people\nlean on prescription drugs.\nNow there's a caveat to that,\nwhich is in under conditions\nlike severe eating disorders,\nobsessive compulsive\ndisorder, bipolar disorder,\ndepression where people are\ntruly at risk of suicide\nor severe mental health effects\nor behavioral health effects\nand they're really at,\ntheir lives are at risk\nand their overall mood\nand wellbeing is at risk,\nit's often the case that\npeople cannot access\nthe brain states required\nto shift themselves purely\nwith behavioral tools,\nnutrition, et cetera.\nSo again, for the typical person\nwho's not suffering\nfrom one of the psychiatric disorders\nthat I mentioned before or\nother psychiatric disorders,\nschizophrenia, et cetera,\nI strongly encourage you to\nlook to behavioral tools first,\nnutrition, then supplementation,\nthen and only if there's a remaining need,\nto prescription drugs.\nThis contrasts very much\nwith the typical scenario\nI hear about these days\nwhere college students\nor other people will say,\noh yeah, I hear that there's this drug,\nRitalin or Vyvanse that can\nimmediately put me into a state\nof heightened focus and concentration.\nNow listen, if you have ADHD,\nby all means, talk to a physician,\ntalk to a great psychiatrist\nand figure out whether or\nnot that's right for you.\nBut if you don't,\nagain, behavioral tools,\nnutrition, supplementation,\nand in particular, those behavioral tools\nare going to be the ones\nthat are going to allow you\nto teach your neural circuits\nhow to focus and concentrate better,\nand I cannot overstate\nthe importance of that,\nthat the behavioral tools,\nand to some extent the supplementation\ncombined with behavioral tools\nreally allow you to train\nup your neural circuits\nso that you can focus and concentrate\nto the depth and the\ndegree and the duration\nthat's going to best serve\nyour mental and physical goals.\nNow there's one other compound\nthat I've used from time to\ntime and that I continue to use\nin order to increase\nfocus and concentration\nand I will use this in combination\nwith the other supplements\nI talked about before\nand that's phenylethylamine.\nPhenylethylamine is in the\ndopamine synthesis pathway,\nso it increases dopamine transmission\nand tends to function a\nlittle bit differently\nthan L-tyrosine.\nSo every once in a while,\nI'll swap out L-tyrosine\nand put in 500 milligrams\nof phenylethylamine\nor sometimes, if I really want\nto push a little bit harder\non the dopamine system,\nand I'm going to be doing a\nlong about of intense work,\nI will take the 300\nmilligrams of Alpha-GPC,\nthe 500 milligrams of L-tyrosine,\nI'll generally take\nthat with some caffeine,\nand I should mention,\nI don't go past about 100 or\n200 milligrams of caffeine\n'cause I don't really\nlike feeling too jittery,\nthat's not really my goal,\nit's the goal to be alert,\nbut not so alert that I really\ncan't focus on anything,\nI'm not interested in having\nan anxiety attack after all,\nbut I'll sometimes either swap in\nor I will add that 500\nmilligrams of phenylethylamine.\nPhenylethylamine is in the PEA pathway.\nI've talked about this\nin a previous podcast on\ndopamine motivation and drive,\nand it's a very short-lived compound.\nSo what I'll tend to do is take it\nonce at the beginning of the workout\nand sometimes in the\nmiddle of the workout,\nI'll take another 500 milligram capsule.\nBut what I just described\nwith combining all of those compounds,\nAlpha-GPC, L-tyrosine,\nphenylethylamine and caffeine,\nthat's a fairly rare occurrence\nthat I'll combine all four\nand really only under conditions\nin which I have to do an\nintensely challenging about\nof mental or physical work.\nI would say the frequency\nat which I combine\nall four of those things\nis probably about once every two weeks,\nand typically more like once a month,\nagain being careful to do that\nin the early part of the day,\ncertainly before the noon hour,\nso that I am in no way\ngoing to disrupt my sleep.\nI realize that many of you\nare probably wondering about\nor hoping that I'll discuss things\nlike lions mane or the racetams\nor some of the other compounds\nthat are known to powerfully modulate\nthe dopamine, epinephrine\nand acetylcholine systems.\nTo be quite direct,\nthere are far too many of these compounds\nto review in a single episode,\nand they all generally tap\ninto the same set of processes.\nAgain, epinephrine, that\nshaft of the arrowhead\nthat we're thinking of as focus,\nacetylcholine, which is\nthe arrowhead itself,\nand then dopamine,\nwhich is the sort of\npropeller behind the arrow\nthat allows it to\ncontinually drive forward\nthrough a about of\nmental or physical work.\nThere is a wonderful site.\nI've mentioned it several\ntimes before on this podcast.\nThat is examine.com.\nThat wonderful site that is examine.com\nhas recently been updated,\nthey've changed their format.\nIt was terrific before,\nit provided links to relevant studies,\nit talked about specific compounds,\nit talked about the magnitude of effect,\nit talked about the human effect matrix,\nit really focused on human studies\nwith links to those studies and on and on.\nThe new revamped version of\nexamine.com is even better,\nit's really next, next level.\nI really applaud them for\ndoing such a terrific job\nin organizing the information.\nThere are a lot of interesting\npages that you can read there\nabout different compounds.\nSo you can put in any\ncompound, ginko biloba,\nphosphatidylserine, Alpha-GPC,\nand you're going to get a\nrich array of information\nabout those compounds.\nAnd if you were to put\nin a specific goal state,\nthat is focus or concentration\nor sleep or hormones,\nlike testosterone, et cetera,\nyou're going to get a rich array\nof compounds and supplements\nas well as links to the\nstudies on those compounds\nand some details about\nthose particular studies.\nIt's an absolutely phenomenal site.\nIt's one that I rely on\nand that I know thousands,\nif not millions of other people rely on\nand I encourage you to check it out.\nAgain, the URL is examine.com.\nSo today we've talked about\na number of different tools\nand to some extent, some mechanisms\ninvolved in concentration and focus,\nand really the goal\nhas been to provide you\nan understanding of the\nneurochemical systems\nand a little bit about the neurocircuits\nthat can allow you to achieve\nstates of attention and focus.\nIn contrast to previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere I've covered these topics\nin tremendous depth as\nit relates to mechanism\nand also focused on tools,\ntoday, I largely focused on tools.\nSo we talked about behavioral tools,\nlike a meditation that's\n13 minutes long done daily\nspecifically to improve\nyour ability to focus,\nand in fact, there are data\nto support that it will.\nWe talked about hypnosis, we\ntalked about visual focus,\novert and covert,\nwe talked about various supplements,\nsuch as Alpha-GPC,\nphenylethylamine, L-tyrosine,\nsupplements that I use\nto directly modulate the neural circuits\nfor concentration and focus.\nWe also talked about\ncreatine and the omega-3s.\nWe talked about the importance of sleep,\nwhich modulates our ability\nto function mentally\nand physically overall,\nso optimize that sleep.\nAnd we talked about a\nnumber of other protocols\nthat you can incorporate.\nMy hope in giving you all this information\nin one single location\nis that you'll be able\nto pick and choose\nwhich of these protocols you\nwould like to incorporate\ninto your attempts to improve\nyour focus and concentration.\nAgain, I don't recommend\ndoing all of these protocols all at once.\nWhat I recommend is\npicking a handful of them,\nmaybe one or two, maybe three or four,\nand trying them in different combinations\nat different times of day\nand for different purposes,\nfor mental work, for\nphysical work, et cetera,\nand find what is best for you.\nOnce again, the goal\nis to teach your brain,\nthat is to increase neuroplasticity\nin the neural circuits\nthat allow you not just to focus,\nbut to refocus your attention.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't mention\nthat it's also critical\nto be able to defocus.\nI highly encourage people to\ntake a period of time each day\nto daydream, to walk down the hall\nwithout looking at your phone,\nto not have to incorporate\nmore sensory information,\nto not place increasing\ndemands on yourself to focus,\nand see and realize how having a period\nof deliberate decompression and defocusing\ncan allow your brain\nto focus so
