    "video_title": "LIVE EVENT Q&A: Dr. Andrew Huberman Question & Answer in Portland, OR",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based-tools for everyday life.\n[light music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology in Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nRecently, I had the pleasure\nof hosting two live events,\none in Seattle, Washington,\nand one in Portland, Oregon,\nboth entitled \"The Brain Body Contract,\"\nwhere I discussed science\nand science-related tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth and performance.\nMy favorite part of each evening, however,\nwas the question and answer period\nthat followed the lecture.\nI love the question and answer period\nbecause it gives me an\nopportunity to hear directly\nfrom the audience as to\nwhat they want to know most,\nand indeed to get into a bit of dialogue.\nSo we really clarify what\nare the underlying mechanisms\nof particular tools,\nhow best to use the tools for\nthings like focus and sleep.\nWe also touched on some things\nrelated to mental health\nand physical health.\nIt was a delight for me,\nand I like to think that\nthe audience learned a lot.\nI know that many of you weren't\nable to attend those events,\nbut we wanted to make the\ninformation available to you.\nTherefore, what follows\nthis is a recording\nof the question and answer period\nfrom the lecture in Portland, Oregon.\nI hope you'll find it to be\nboth interesting and informative.\nI'd also like to thank our\nsponsors of these live events.\nThe first is Momentous Supplements,\nwhich is our partner with\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\nproviding supplements that are\nof the very highest quality\nthat ship international and\nthat are arranged in dosages\nand single ingredient\nformulations that make it possible\nfor you to develop the optimal\nsupplement strategy for you.\nAnd I'd also like to\nthank our other sponsor,\nwhich is InsideTracker,\nwhich provides blood tests and DNA tests\nso you can monitor your immediate\nand long-term health progress.\nI'd also like to announce that there are\ntwo new live events scheduled.\nThe first one is going to take\nplace Sunday, October 16th,\nat The Wiltern Theater in Los Angeles.\nThe other live event will take place\nWednesday, November 9th,\nat the Beacon Theatre in New York City.\nTickets to both of those\nevents are now available online\nat hubermanlab.com/tour.\nThat's hubermanlab.com/tour.\nI do hope that you learn\nfrom and enjoy the recording\nof the question and answer\nperiod that follows this.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[light music]\n\"What are the current best\npractices for post TBIs,\"\ntraumatic brain injuries for those of you\nthat aren't familiar with TBIs,\n\"Especially long term,\nmultiple,\" ooh, \"et cetera.\"\n\"Thoughts on hyperbaric O?\"\nI'm so glad you asked\nthis, Danny Morledge,\n\"As treatment for TBIs?\"\nOkay, TBI...\nNow, one thing about TBI and concussion,\neveryone thinks football.\nGuess what?\nMost of the TBI is not football.\nThere aren't that many football players,\nthey're just large so they stand out.\nThere might be a few here this evening.\n[audience laughing]\nOf course, football players are a concern\nwhen it comes to TBI.\nMost head injuries are going\nto be construction workers.\nHave you ever seen the\nhard hats they wear?\nThose, I don't even know if\nthey are just there for show.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nAnd that we actually\nhave a lab at Stanford\nthat's focused very hard on\ntrying to solve this problem.\nSo, construction workers, car\naccidents, bicycle accidents.\nPortland, amazing city to cycle;\nI'm frankly afraid to cycle.\nYou're a small moving object\naround these big objects\nand people are staring\ninto their little aperture\non their phone while driving.\nI mean, whatever happened\nto that by the way,\nof not texting while driving?\nSomehow that just disappeared.\nIt's like, it really has just disappeared.\nThere was all this science\nshowing that it's worse\nthan drunk driving.\nTBI.\nWell, the basic rules\nof the \"don'ts\" apply.\nIf you get a head injury,\ndon't get a second head injury.\nBut that often isn't feasible\nfor people that need to work,\ncontinue working in construction,\nor that are struggling.\nWhat do we know?\nWell, this is a great\nopportunity for me to distinguish\nmodulatory foundational tools\nfrom things that directly\nchange your brain\nand nervous system the\nway that you want to.\nWhat do I mean by modulatory?\nWe hear so much and\nthere's so many studies\nshowing that great\nsleep, quality nutrition,\ngood social interactions,\navoiding chronic stress,\nand on and on and on are\nimportant for everything;\nthey're related to Alzheimer's,\nthey're related to ADHD.\nI mean, we could do\nthousands of podcast episodes\njust returning to the same 10 things:\nSleep, don't stress too much or too long,\ngood social connection, avoid\ntoxic people, eat good food,\nnot too much processed food;\nWe could have an argument all night\nand I don't want to have one about whether\nor not it's mainly plants or this.\nI mean, this is obviously\neating high quality food\nis something that we should all be doing,\nwhich foods you select is a\ntopic that is very barbed wire,\nand I can give only my opinions.\nAll of that modulates your brain function,\nbut it doesn't mediate or\nchange anything directly.\nIt's setting a foundation\nof what's possible.\nSo we should all be doing those things,\nand especially people who have TBI.\nNow, this question relates\nto hyperbaric chamber.\nHyperbaric chamber, there's\nsome very interesting data.\nIt's essentially a\nhyperoxygenation of the brain\nfor very brief periods of time.\nI think the data on\nhyperbaric chamber and TBI\nare very encouraging.\nThe problem is, much in the\nway that a few years ago,\ncryo was only available in a few places.\nAnd now people are doing ice baths\nand cold showers on their own.\nIt's hard to find a hyperbaric chamber.\nThey aren't just laying around,\nand they don't have\nthem at spas typically,\nand they are quite expensive.\nSo, yes, there are\ninteresting and important data\nI think on hyperbaric chamber.\nYou definitely want to\nwork with a physician\nor somebody who is very skilled,\na practitioner who's very\nskilled in hyperbaric chamber.\nThey do seem to improve brain\nfunction by hyperoxygenating\nthe brain for brief periods of time.\nIt seems to improve a number\nof things, but above all,\nit seems to improve the\nquality and duration of sleep,\nwhich indirectly allows\nthe brain to repair itself,\nbecause as I mentioned earlier,\nbrain change largely occurs in sleep.\nSo if you don't have access\nto a hyperbaric chamber,\nbut you do have TBI, what\nare some of the other data?\nWhat do those point to?\nWell, I'd go on and on,\nand you don't have to get\nthis from supplements,\nyou can get it from food,\nbut this threshold level of\nthese EPA essential fatty acids.\nThere are now so many data,\nso much data on the valuable role\nof these essential EPA fatty acids.\nThresholds being somewhere\nbetween one and two grams\nper day of the EPA.\nSo much so, actually, that\nthere are now prescription forms\nof EPA that doctors are\nstarting to prescribe\nfor people with TBI.\nAlthough for most people\nyou can get this through...\nYou can look up and we've\ndone podcast episodes\nabout different ways to access this.\nAlso functions as an antidepressant;\nequally good, believe it or not,\nin clinical trials to SSRIs\nonce one gets over the one or\nbasically two grams per day\nof the EPA.\nThe resident expert on\nthe internet about this\nis pretty extreme about the dosages,\nand that's Dr. Rhonda\nPatrick, who by the way,\ndeserves a nod of\nacknowledgement and support\nbecause it turns out that\nbefore me or David Sinclair\nor Matt Walker or any of these guys\nwere blabbing to the world about\nstuff that they had learned\nin the archives of science\nand in their laboratories,\nthe first person in was this\nwoman named Rhonda Patrick.\nAs far as I know, the first\npublic facing formerly trained\nscientist to start going\non all these podcasts\nand risk her reputation\nand this kind of stuff\nthat you deal with when\nyou put your neck out\nthere like that.\nAnd Rhonda's, I think, terrific.\nWe don't agree on everything\nand it would be weird if we did,\nbut I think she's really\nbeen the proponent\nof these higher doses of EPAs for TBI\nand for cognitive function into all ages.\n\"We often hear about ways\nto increase dopamine.\nHowever, are there effective\nways to decrease dopamine\nwhen you get too much of\nit for certain behaviors\nor habits we want to break?\"\nKatie Hamm, I think is the last name.\nThank you, Katie, for your question.\nYeah, dopamine is a slippery slope.\nAnd Dr. Anna Lembke is the expert in this,\nand we've had a lot of conversations.\nShe's one of my closer\nfriends on the faculty.\nUnfortunately for her,\nour coffee discussions\noften last four hours or more.\nHer poor patients and family.\nHere's the thing,\nwhen dopamine is higher\nin your brain and body,\nwhen you've deployed it through excitement\nor pharmacology or otherwise,\nit tends to narrow your focus\nand make you seek more of it\nin that general theme that\nyou happen to be focused on.\nIt could be anything.\nThat's the scary thing about dopamine.\nWhat can you do to control\nit and to reduce it?\nWell, for those of you\nthat are engaging in habits\nthat are healthy,\nmaybe that doesn't\nrequire reducing dopamine.\nHow do you define\nhealthy versus unhealthy?\nWell, I think the simplest\nway to define addiction,\nat least by my mind,\nis that addiction is a\nprogressive narrowing\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nAnd a good life is a progressive expansion\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nA rather simple definition,\nand yet when we think about\nthe biology of dopamine,\ndopamine is not unique to one pursuit.\nIt's not unique to the pursuit of sex\nor the pursuit of warmth when you're cold\nor cool environments when you're too warm\nor food or social media,\nit's just a dumb molecule that puts you\ninto this forward state of\nmass, small visual aperture,\nand a kind of obsessive-like nature.\nWhat can you do to counter that?\nWell, the best thing to do\nis to not get into that state too long,\nbut if you do, the best\nthing you can do is to try\nand switch off that system,\nnot through pharmacology,\nbut by not pursuing more dopamine.\nThe day after a big event,\nthe so-called postpartum depression,\nnamed of course because of true postpartum\nafter the delivery of a child.\nIt's quite common for people\nto get very, very depressed.\nThere's a lot of neurochemical\nand hormonal adjustments\nthat are occurring,\nbut different types of\npostpartum depression occur;\nafter a big party, the Monday\nblues, the Sunday blues,\nthe post-whatever blues.\nThe four month mark in a\nrelationship is typically\nwhen dopamine starts to drop.\nI always tell people, just wait.\nI'm telling somebody very\nclose to me right now,\njust wait four months,\nfour months, four months,\nand also spend as much time\nwith that person as possible.\nI don't know what this deal is\nabout not spending as\nmuch time with people.\nI think people are afraid\nthat the dopamine wave pool\nis just going to pull them both under.\nI think they've called that\nthe escalator model of relationship,\nwhere you just sort of find\nyourself in the relationship\nbecause you went through\nthe stages without\nactually deciding on them.\nIn any event, four months\nseems to be the stage in which\nthe dopamine crescendo\nstarts to relax a little bit,\nnot in a long distance\nrelationship, however.\nWe know this, right?\nAnticipation is dopamine,\nthat positive anticipation,\nand there's a whole\nbeautiful science of this,\nand I should say psychology of this.\nThere's a wonderful book actually.\nThe name of the book\nis embarrassing always,\nI don't know why, for me to say.\nIt's by a psychologist\ncalled \"Can Love Last?\",\nwhich is a psychoanalytic book\nabout this dopamine-serotonin system\nand the kind of seesawing back and forth.\nAnd the fact that in relationships,\npeople often just slam on\nthe dopamine side of things\nand then they hit a wall\nand want to break up.\nOr they go into this like warm,\ncozy, fuzzy feeling thing,\nand they go, \"Well, I guess\nthe exciting part is over.\"\nAnd this idea that one could actually,\nor two people or however\nmany people were in Portland\ncould oscillate this seesaw.\n[audience laughing]\nI don't think that you\nwant to use pharmacology\nto turn off the dopamine system,\nbut for people that have\na hard time sleeping\nand that are really in\na state of agitation\nand constantly obsessing,\nthe psychiatrists...\nOne of the oldest and\nmost effective treatments\nis that the psychiatrists,\nand this does have to be prescribed,\nwe use a very, very low dose\nof a dopamine receptor blocker,\nlike Haloperidol, which is\nused to treat schizophrenia.\nA very low dose to shut down\nthe obsession component.\nThe smart, well-educated psychiatrists\nknow this as a useful tool,\nbut this is a one time\nthing with a very low dose\nbecause having your\ndopamine blocked sucks.\nIt does not feel good,.\nBut not being able to sleep\nand being in an obsessive mode also sucks.\nSo it's actually a very\npotent clinical tool.\nSo pharmacology is one tool,\nbut really at the far end of things.\nI believe that one should try and modulate\ntheir own dopamine by\nnot rewarding one's self\non a regular basis, but only randomly.\nRandom intermittent reward\nis truly the best schedule\nof reward, hence slot machines and so on.\nAnd you should engage\nrandom intermittent reward.\nAnd I think this is also the\nway that we should train kids.\nI call it training kids.\nYou can tell I don't have kids.\n[audience laughing]\nYou don't reward them every time.\nI don't believe everyone\nshould get a trophy every time,\nnor should you always\njust reward the winners\nbecause those winners often,\nwe see cases of this, high\nprofile cases of this,\nthey often crash and burn.\nI mean the number of high performers\nthat crash and burn publicly\nand Lord knows how many do\nit privately is remarkable.\nIt's 'cause their dopamine\nsystem is all messed up.\nSo random intermittent reward\nis the schedule of reward\nthat we should impart on ourselves.\n\"If you had 10 minutes a day to improve\nyour brain plasticity, what would you do?\nAnd when would you do it?\"\nRichard Conlin, thank you.\nWell, I'm going to say again,\nI would absolutely anchor my physiology\nwith morning sunlight viewing.\nI can't help it.\nDo you know what's interesting?\nAnd I'll tell you very briefly,\nyou know what's special\nabout morning sunlight?\nThis low solar angle sunlight.\nI don't think I've talked\nabout this much on social media\nor on the podcast.\nThere's a group at the\nUniversity of Washington,\na couple, Jay and Maureen Neitz.\nThey run a lab together.\nThat sounds like a horrible thing,\nbut they do it and they\nget along very well.\nAnd they've discovered\nthat the cells in your eye,\nthe neurons that set your circadian clock\nmake you alert during the day\nand make you sleepy at night,\nand so on.\nThose cells respond best\nto yellow-blue contrast\nand orange tones.\nNow, this is important\nbecause when you go out\nin the morning, even\nif it's not at sunrise,\nbut it's close to sunrise\nor you look at the sun in the evening,\nwhat you'll see is yellow-blue\ncontrast or orange;\nyellow, blue, orange,\nthat old thing from\nkindergarten or first grade.\nThat's not the color of light\nthat you're going to see\nwhen the sun is overhead.\nNow, this also is really interesting\nbecause artificial lights,\nat least to my understanding,\neven the daylight simulators\nhave not picked up on this.\nIt's just about bright light.\nSomeone ought to design\nsomething that can mimic this,\nbut nature has done\nthis beautifully for us.\nAnd so viewing low solar\nangle sunlight in the morning\nand in the evening is most effective\nbecause of those yellow-blue contrasts.\nNow here's the really wild thing.\nThose circuits that set your\nlevels of alertness and sleep,\nyes, they respond best\nto yellow-blue contrast,\nbut what that tells us is crazy.\nWhat that means is that color vision\nwas probably not related\nto color perception first\nbecause all of that is\ncompletely subconscious.\nThe pathways that do this\nare present in people\nwho are pattern vision blind.\nSo, what do I mean?\nI mean that color vision likely evolved\nfrom a need to synchronize\nyour internal state\nwith the external world.\nAnd the best stimulus in the outside world\nto do that is yellow-blue contrast.\nIn other words, our\nability to detect color\nwas first and foremost, and\nwe understand this based on\nevolutionary genomics and so forth,\nto extract time of day information,\nnot color of fruit or color\nof skin or anything like that.\nThat's all secondary,\nwhich is wild and crazy.\nAnd this is yet another example of the way\nwe think things work is\nnot the way they work.\nIt's completely 180 degrees opposite.\nI'm just going to give\nyou a little teaser.\nI had a guest on the podcast,\nwe haven't aired the episode yet.\nHis name is Erich Jarvis,\nhe works on speech and language.\nHe also was admitted into\nAlvin Ailey Dance Company.\nAgain, who are these people?\nHe's a professor at the Rockefeller.\nAnyway, I learned from Erich,\nand you'll learn when\nthat episode comes out,\nthat you only find elaborate\nspeech and language\nin species that also\nengage in dance and song.\nAnd the genomics point to the\nfact that song and singing\ncame first and language came second.\nAnd that led me during that\nepisode of the podcast,\nI wrote down in my notes,\nI was listening to him talk and\nI wrote down in my notebook,\nit's just scrawled in big letters.\nIt says, \"I am so happy right now.\"\nI was just blown away.\nAnd it makes so much\nsense when you hear it,\nthat the colors in the\nsky were what our system\nis trying to extract,\nnot a perception of\nthose colors in the sky,\n'cause they're informing us about time\nand orienting us in time.\nThat song and the communication\nof emotional states\nwould be simpler and more foundational\nthan communication about\nspecific patterns of language.\nWhen you hear it, suddenly it makes sense.\nBut of course we're human beings,\nand unless you're Erich Jarvis\nor Alia Crum or Anna Lembke,\nyou think about all this\nstuff backwards, as I do.\n\"How can I navigate my way\nthrough taking supplements\nto optimize my health\nwhen my career demands,\nArmy infantry, prevent me\nfrom being able to establish\nconsistent routines?\"\nAndrew Yagen, well thank\nyou for doing what you do.\nAndrew, so the consistent\nroutine thing is tough.\nHere's what I can say\nwithout going into a long\ntwo and a half hour episode\nabout jet lag and shift work,\nwhich we've done.\nThe most powerful way to anchor\nyour brain and body in time\nis indeed viewing sunlight\nat consistent times of day.\nThat's not something I made up.\nWe know this based on a\nlot of work that dates back\nto the 1930s.\nThe second most powerful\nstimulus is going to be movement\nand changes in body temperature.\nIn particular, increases\nin body temperature\ntend to make us alert,\nand decreases in body temperature\ntend to make us sleepy.\nBody temperature drops\none to three degrees\nto get us into sleep.\nWhy does a cold shower wake you up?\nAdrenaline is released\nand believe it or not,\nyour body is heating up\ninternally to combat that cold,\nunless you make yourself hypothermic.\nSo, sauna, hot baths to get sleepy,\ncold showers, ice baths,\net cetera to wake up.\nSort of obvious when you hear it,\nbut it's counterintuitive\nbecause you think,\noh, heating up the body to wake up\nand cooling down the body to go to sleep.\nSo getting into cold\nought to cool me down,\nbut your body compensates\njust like if you threw a\ncold towel on a thermostat,\nyou'd crank up the temperature in the room\nand vice versa for heat.\nOkay, so what do you do?\nYou want to try and use\nas many of these things,\nlight, temperature, exercise, food.\nWhen you eat is typically\nassociated with waking.\nVery few of us are capable\nof eating in our sleep.\nAnd then the other one is\nsocial activity and rhythms.\nNow the discombobulated person\nis going to be the person\nthat has not aligned these\nthings in a consistent way.\nSo while schedules vary,\nand Andrew, I don't know\nyour exact schedule,\nwhat I can say is if you\nsuddenly go from daytime behavior\nand sleeping at night to\nthe so-called vampire shift,\nas it's called in the military,\nand suddenly you're up in\nthe middle of the night\nand you're sleeping during the day,\nthen when you come off that shift,\nwhat you want to do is try\nand combine as many of those\nsame things at one time.\nSo it would be get your sunlight,\nso go jogging without your sunglasses,\ndrink your coffee, engage with\nother people and communicate,\neat a meal afterwards or\nas the case may be before.\nTry and bring as many\nof those things together\nat the same time of day for a few days\nand pretty soon your system\nwill map around that.\nSo the reason I encourage for those of us\nthat are not doing shift work\nto try and be fairly consistent\nabout sunlight viewing\nis it sets in motion\neverything else that's correct,\nin terms of timing of\neating, appetite will follow,\nwhen your alert will follow.\nYou'll start to learn your own rhythms.\nWhen you can't control your schedule,\ntry and combine as many of those cues;\nagain, light, temperature, exercise, food,\nsocial engagement into one period of time\nand try and lock that into a more or less\na one or two hour period or\nplus or minus one or two hours\nat a particular time of day\nfor at least two or three days.\nAnd your schedule, meaning\nyour internal clocks\nwill lock to that.\n\"How is social media changing our brains?\"\nThomas Adcock.\nWell, you hear all the terrible ways\nin which it's changing our brains.\nAnd I think that again,\nwe go back to this thing,\nis it the aperture that we're looking at?\nSo is it the format that\nwe're engaging in things?\nOr is it the content?\nWell, the way I like to\nthink about the phone\nis the way that we've been\nengaging with the phone\nand the laptop for that matter,\nin staring into the small\nvisual aperture each day\nis sort of like walking like\nthis all day long, right?\nWe have this amazing\nability to shuffle our feet\nand take small steps\nor to take big strides,\nto run, to move...\nI think that's the sagittal\nplane for movement.\nI know it for the brain,\nbut I always mess it.\nThe PTs are vicious\npeople online, by the way.\nThe PTs and nutrition people,\nI've learned to just not\nsay anything about that.\nI'm not a PT and I'm not\na physical therapist.\nAnd they do incredible\nwork, but they're like,\nit's a very spirited crowd.\n[audience laughing]\nAnd the nutrition thing is really weird.\nI mean, it's just incredible.\nPeople are either throwing liver at you\nor they're throwing celery at you\nor they're fasting or they're not fasting.\nIt's nuts.\nIn any case, the social media\nand staring at a small visual aperture\nis changing our brains.\nHere's one way I know in\nwhich it's changing our brains\nand then I'll tell you how to fix it.\nIf you stare or look at\nsomething within two feet of you\nfor a certain number of hours each day,\nyour eyeball actually gets longer.\nAnd the visual image then is focused\nin front of your neural retina,\nnot onto your neural retina,\nand you are becoming myopic; nearsighted.\nAnd if you look at things\nin the distance enough,\nguess what?\nYour eyeball changes shape\nand your lens will focus\nappropriately the image onto your retina.\nIt takes some work.\nKids that look at things\nup close too much,\nand adults that look at\nthings up close too much\nbecome nearsighted.\nAnd there's a beautiful\nset of clinical trials now\nwhere mainly in kids,\nif kids get outside for two hours a day,\ngetting a lot of this UVB and blue light\nthat we're told is so terrible for us,\nbut they get it from sunlight,\nthey actually can reverse myopia,\nor reduce the incidence of\nmyopia, maybe even glaucoma.\nAlthough that's a big maybe.\nSo, how much staring into\na small visual aperture\nis too much?\nI don't know.\nBut what we do know is that we\nare literally becoming myopic\nin terms of our vision\nand we're becoming myopic\nin terms of our cognition.\nAnd then there's the whole business\nof what's actually\ncontained in those Tweets\nand those social media feeds\nand those news stories.\nWhich frankly, I feel\nlike you lose either way,\nwhether or not you're\nin one political camp\nor another political camp,\nyou're upset about half of\nthe information out there.\nSo I feel like, and I'm\nnot someone who knows\nhow to talk about politics\nwithout stumbling,\nI didn't do well in social\nstudies in this sort of thing.\nIt just never made sense to me.\nIt just felt like the\nprize goes to the person\nwho can shout the loudest\nand the most coherently\nfor a moment.\nBut I encourage, of course,\npeople to be politically active.\nAnd I vote.\n[audience laughing]\nBut the content is tricky to navigate.\nAnd I can't really speak to that,\nexcept that it seems to\nbe bothering everybody\non one side or the other or in the middle.\nAnd the format is something\nthat we really understand.\nAnd again, I don't know of\nmany people that are talking\nabout this narrow visual\nwindow format thing.\nIt came up more during the\nlockdowns when we were all inside\na lot and not looking out at a distance.\nThe data say really to try\nand get at least 10 minutes\nof long distance viewing,\nso longer than 10 feet away from us,\nfor every 30 minutes of closeup viewing.\nAnd not a lot of us are doing that.\nIf you're walking to your\ncar looking at your phone,\nyou're definitely losing an opportunity.\n\"What new piece of neurological research\nare you most excited about?\nMateo Minato.\nOoh.\nI think the piece of\nneurological research that I...\nAll right, the weird stuff.\nI've got this colleague at Stanford,\nTony Wyss-Coray, and they're\nreally into literally taking\nproteins from young blood\nand young spinal cord\ncerebral spinal fluid\nand putting it into\nolder people and animals,\nand they get younger.\nThat stuff's pretty wild.\nThe fecal transplant stuff is pretty wild.\nYou take the microbiome from\none person and as it sounds,\nyou transplant it to somebody else\nand they take on the physical\ncharacteristics of the donor.\nIt's crazy.\nUntil I talk to my [chuckling]...\nThere's some shouts for fecal transplant.\nNice.\n[audience laughing]\nI have never read the method\nsections of those papers.\nI'm actually afraid to\nread the method sections.\nI would say this is not neurological,\nbut the work from Chris\nGardner and Justin Sonnenburg,\nalso at Stanford,\nit makes it sound like I just like,\n\"Stanford, Stanford, Stanford.\"\nBut these are the people I'm\nclosest to and surrounded by.\nThere are excellent places\neverywhere, of course,\nincluding OHSU and I'm not just\nsaying that 'cause I'm here.\nI actually close colleagues\nhere and friends here at OHSU.\nAlso an amazing, although\nthat tram thing freaks me out,\nit's like I always just\nhave all these ideas\nabout what's going to\nhappen if that thing breaks.\nBut the microbiome data\nare really interesting.\nI never understood why\ngetting your gut microbiome\nwas important.\nAnd it turns out it's because\nyour gut actually makes\nmany of the neurotransmitter precursors\nthat your brain uses.\nSo that's pretty cool.\nAnd I always thought it\nwould be a complicated thing\nto get your gut microbiome right,\nbut it turns out that it's fermented foods\nthat seem to have the biggest effect.\nThere was all this argument\nabout fiber and yes,\nfiber is important and\nhere I'm getting nervous\ntalking about nutrition,\n'cause the people are going\nto come at me with fiber.\nBut it's very clear from\nJustin and Chris's data\nthat people who are\ngetting four servings a day\nof fermented foods,\nwhether or not it's kimchi\nor sauerkraut or kombucha,\nthat stuff actually seems to encourage\na healthy gut microbiome\nand people feel better,\nand their immune system works better.\nAnd I like this because it actually,\nit resolves an issue which\nis that high dose probiotics,\nthese very expensive need\nto be refrigerated things,\nthose actually can create brain\nfog and other issues there\nfor real severe cases of dysbiosis.\nSo I always like an instance\nwhere one can look to foods\nwhich are good, 'cause I like to eat,\nin order to resolve these issues.\nIn terms of other neurologic issues,\nfrankly, I think the stuff on dopamine\nis fundamentally important.\nSo much addiction, that's a severe case,\nbut also so much waxing\nand waning of motivation.\nAnd once you understand the\ndopamine system and you say,\n\"What activities am I engaging in\nor pharmacology am I engaging in?\nWhat am I doing to spike dopamine?\"\nYou start to go, \"Oh, I get it.\nThe waves in this wave pool are too high\nand that's why I can't\ndo this consistently.\"\nAnd then you do the counterintuitive thing\nof approaching things with\na little less excitement,\nbut then you're able to\ndo them more consistently.\nIt's like, \"Ah!\"\nAnd maybe with some luck, I'll\nend up finishing this book\nthat I've been working on\nfor four and a half years\nas a consequence 'cause I can't seem to.\n\"Thinking about the Wim Hof Method.\nDo you believe it?\nHow is it really working?\nWhat process is happening in his brain?\"\nOh, boy.\nMadison Cameron and everyone\nhere probably familiar\nwith Wim Hof.\nWhose occupation on Wikipedia\nused to be \"Daredevil.\"\nThat was cool.\nIt's like Evel Knievel\nhad it and Wim had it.\nI got a story about Wim.\nActually in 2016, I heard\nabout this guy, Wim Hof,\nand I got a hold of him,\nactually his children.\nAnd I had one vacation that\nyear and I flew to Spain\nand I spent some time\nmountaineering with Wim,\nwhich was absolutely terrifying.\nI almost lost a leg legitimately.\nI tied in wrong on a bridge sling.\nHe told me it was good for me.\nHe told me to, \"Stare\ninto the lizard's eyes.\"\nAnd I stared into the lizard's eyes.\nI jumped backwards off this\nhomemade bridge sling thing.\nAnd I had the rope wrapped through my leg\nand I came back with basically the tendon\non the back of my knee exposed.\nAnd sitting next to me on the plane\nwas our Vice Dean of Research at Stanford.\nAnd I had to explain to him\nwhat I was doing and why.\nIt was very embarrassing.\nWhat did we do on that trip?\nWell, a couple of things that will help me\nanswer your question.\nFirst of all, when I arrived,\nI suffered terribly from jet lag,\nbut the moment I got there,\nWim did not say hello.\nHe literally told me to\nget into the ice bath.\nAnd I did 10 minutes in the\nice bath not because I'm tough,\nbut because he held me\ndown in the ice bath.\nHe is indeed one of the\nstrongest human beings.\nHe reminds me of the bus\ndriver on \"The Simpsons\"\nor the janitor, excuse me.\nNo, Otto is the bus driver, right?\nThe janitor on \"The Simpsons,\"\nlike [grunts] that guy.\nThat's Wim.\nIncredibly physically strong guy.\nWhat do I think's going\non with Wim Hof stuff?\nWell, Wim Hof, whether or\nnot he understands it or not,\nI always think he's sort of\nthe Bob Dylan of breathwork.\nLike everything he says seems\nto have some intuitive sense,\nbut you don't really\nunderstand what in the world\nhe's saying.\n[audience laughing]\nHe's going to come after me now.\nWe've had a good but\ncomplicated relationship,\nI'll just confess.\nMaybe someday we'll resolve that.\nNo big scandal or story there,\njust we communicate very differently.\nWim has a couple methods.\nOne is to deliberately hyperventilate.\nThis is also called Tummo breathing.\nMy lab actually studies this.\nWe have a paper that I'm happy\nto share with you the results\nalthough they're not published yet,\nwhere people do deliberate\ncyclic hyperventilation.\nWhich as the name suggests,\nyou just breathe really deeply in\nand really deeply out 25 times.\nOr if you're Wim, you'd say, \"In and out.\nIn and out.\"\nI just tell people, here's how it works.\nYou go [deeply breathing].\nYou do that 25 times and you heat up\nand you feel really agitated,\nand that's because of adrenaline.\nIf you throw yourself into an ice bath\nor a cold shower, adrenaline.\nIf somebody upsets you\nor you get a triggering text, adrenaline.\nAdrenaline sounds like a terrible thing,\nexcept when you deliberately induce it.\nAs my colleague, David Spiegel says,\n\"There's a big difference\nbetween going into a state\nand you controlling your\nentry into a state.\"\nSo it's not just about\nthe state you're in,\nit's about how you got\nthere and whether or not\nyou had anything to do with it.\nStates of high adrenaline\nare very powerful.\nWhen you self induce\nadrenaline by cold shower,\ncyclic hyperventilation,\nAKA Wim Hof breathing\nor Tummo breathing,\nyou then have an opportunity to create\na very distinct mind-body relationship.\nWe all hear that interoception\nand the mind-body relationship.\nInteroception just your ability\nto sense your heartbeats\nand what's going on in your body.\nPowerful, right?\nTerrible if how you feel sucks.\nSo interoception is wonderful,\nbut when you're anxious it\nactually is more adaptive\nto be able to maintain your thinking\nand get yourself out\nof that anxious state.\nSo if you're trembling and\nyour body's freaking out\nand your cheeks are flushing\nand your brain is following\nyour bodily state,\nwell, that's not good.\nAnd if you're somebody and sadly,\nthis happens a lot where you've\nexperienced a lot of trauma\nor typically this is people\nthat have been bombarded\nwith extreme criticism or physical abuse\nor other kinds of abuse\nduring development.\nThey actually can seem very calm,\nbut internally they're\nfreaking out in their head.\nAnd they're just thinking,\njust get me through this.\nAnd they just go into a state\nwhere no one knows they're upset.\nI've known people like\nthis and it's eerie to me\nbecause I've never had\nthat response to stress,\nbut it's very common.\nAnd so we should learn and\nbe careful about deciding\nthat people are in one state or another\nbased on their bodily or\ntheir mental response.\nVim Hof breathing, cold\nshowers, et cetera,\nare a great practice in my opinion,\nbecause they allow you\nto spike your adrenaline.\nAnd you can do that, for instance,\nby making the water colder\nif you want more adrenaline,\nstaying in longer if you\nwant more adrenaline,\nmoving your limbs around in the water\nwill give you more adrenaline\n'cause it breaks up that thermal layer.\nIt makes it a lot colder.\nOr doing 50 deep inhales and exhales.\nThat is very useful because\nthen you have the opportunity\nto use that prefrontal cortex and to stop\nand sense all that adrenaline in your body\nand yet maintain clarity of mind.\nAnd that's an absolutely powerful tool.\nI would even call it a power tool.\nAnd Wim figured this out.\nI don't know if you know this,\nbut the way that Wim discovered all this\nwas he was in deep grief about\nthe tragic death of his wife.\nShe committed suicide, jumped\noff an eight story building.\nJust truly tragic death.\nAnd he was in situation, he\nhad four children at the time.\nNow, he has five.\nAnd he was in a state of depression\nand he ended up going into\nthe canal in Amsterdam\nand it was very cold and\nit shocked his system.\nAnd in that shock to his system,\nwhich is caused by adrenaline,\nhe somehow was able to anchor his thinking\nand in kind of genius\nof sorts, Wim thought,\n\"Wow, I can intervene in my physiology\nwith this strange activity.\"\nAnd then he realized that\nbreathing would do it as well.\nYou didn't have to get into cold water.\nAnd then, years later, we discovered,\nnot we meaning my lab, but other labs,\nthat when you get into cold water,\neven just 60 degree water,\nthat there's a very long\nlasting increase in dopamine.\nThat is 2.5x above baseline,\nwhich is on par with\nsome prescription drugs\nfor increasing dopamine.\nSo when people laugh at me and go,\n\"Oh this cold water thing,\"\nI get teased a lot on the internet.\nI've heard on the internet\nthat I eat sticks of butter,\nwhich I never said.\nI said, \"I like butter.\"\n[audience laughing]\nI've been told all sorts of things.\nI've been told I eat sticks of butter.\nI don't know why.\nI've been told that I'm dead.\nThat was an interesting one.\nThat was one of the cooler ones.\nBut when I was going out\nthere as a serious scientist\nand saying, \"Using\ndeliberate cold exposure.\"\nYou can use all sorts of things.\nOr if you come to my lab,\nI'd be happy to put you in VR\nand expose you to all\nsorts of scary stuff.\nOr we can inject you with adrenaline\nor you can inject yourself with adrenaline\nand titrate that, adjust\nthe levels of that.\nSo it's a very powerful tool.\nAnd I think that Wim and\nothers deserve credit\nfor really tapping into that.\nAnd as a last point,\nthere's a beautiful study\nin the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nyears ago using this deliberate\ncyclic hyperventilation\nthing; 25 breath [deeply breathing].\nAnd then another group meditates.\nAnd then they inject\nthem both with E. coli.\nAnd the people injected\nwith E. coli who meditate\nget nauseous, vomit, diarrhea,\nand they get a fever.\nAnd the people who\n[deeply breathing] first,\nfar fewer symptoms, if any.\nWhy?\nBecause adrenaline actually\nsuppresses a lot of these\ninnate immune responses\nin a way that's healthy\nin the short term.\nThis is why you can work,\nwork, work, work, work,\nwhere you can study for finals,\nor you can take care of a loved one\nand then you finally stop\nand rest and go on vacation,\nand then you get sick.\nStress activates your nervous\nsystem and in doing so,\nit activates your immune system.\nMakes perfect sense\nwhen you think about it.\nHow would we ever go through famine\nif you're just getting flus\nwhenever you're stressed?\nWe can deal with a lot.\nMy suggestion is if you're coming off\na period of high stress,\nto do some sort of\nadrenaline spiking behavior\nas you taper out of that stressful period,\nnot going strictly to massage, vacation,\nand yoga nidra all day long,\nas I would reflexively do.\n\"Can red light therapy help\ntreat exercise intolerance\nand fatigue in mitochondrial disease?\"\nAllison, I'm glad you brought this up.\nThis is another case where I thought,\n\"Oh no, this red light stuff is crazy.\"\nAnd then I went into the\nliterature and it turns out\nthat in 1908, the Nobel\nPrize was actually given\nfor phototherapy.\nSo, there we go again.\nAnd I have this slide,\nI chose not to use slides tonight,\nbut I have this slide that shows Ken Kesey\nand the magic bus and\nstuff from the 1930s,\nand psychedelics and people\ngetting into cold water.\nAnd then here we are, 2019,\n2020, you've got Wim Hof,\nand Matt Johnson giving people\nmacro doses of psilocybin.\nWe're right back where we were.\nAnd one of my major goals is to really try\nand create some scientific\ndiscussion around these things.\nThis stuff is crazy on the face of it,\nbut there are mechanisms that\nare real that underlie it.\nRed light, because it's\nlong wavelength light,\nlonger literally as opposed\nto a short wavelength light,\ncan penetrate through things like skin\nand can indeed change mitochondria.\nOne of the more impressive\nresults on red light\ncomes from my good\nfriend, Glen Jeffery's Lab\nat the University College London.\nI've known Glen for years,\nand a few years, he was\na basic vision scientist.\nAnd a few years ago he\nstarted using red light.\nHe'd have people look at red light\nat a distance of about\ntwo feet in the morning.\nSo is long wavelength light.\nAnd sometimes even just take a flashlight,\na torch as they call it in England,\nand cover it with a red film.\nAnd they would look at this stuff\nfor a few minutes each morning,\nand it can reverse some forms\nof age-related vision loss\nand macular degeneration.\nHow we now know it can\nprove mitochondrial function\nin photoreceptors by\nreducing what are called\nreactive oxygen species.\nHere's what's interesting,\nit only seems to work\nin people older than 40,\nand it seems to only\nwork if you do it within\nthe first three hours of waking.\nAnd the incredible\nthing is you can do this\nfor one or two minutes a week,\nand some of the positive effects last\nas long as three weeks.\nAnd it's affecting a very specific form\nof visual improvement, which is acuity,\nkind of fine detail stuff\nin a particular wavelength.\nSo, particular colors\nand objects and things.\nPretty impressive.\nSo, yes, red light can\nimprove mitochondrial function\nto the photo receptors.\nIf you are going to try and do this stuff,\ndon't put it too close.\nI don't have any affiliation\nto any red light panel company.\nSo I can't say anything there.\nThey are rather expensive.\nNowadays, people are putting\nred light everywhere,\nand I do mean everywhere.\nPeople are putting red\nlight on their stomach\nfor improving ovarian function,\nwhether or not it can\npenetrate isn't clear to me\nall the way down there.\nPeople are trying to do this.\nI have a friend, I won't name him.\nRecently, he told me he is really into\nthe red light therapy.\nHe's putting it on his testicles\nto try and increase testosterone.\nBut he told me that after\nhe handed me the red light.\n[audience laughing]\nTrue story.\nMy team knows who this is.\nIt's no one on my team.\nThank goodness.\nI was like, \"Oh, that's\nsuper interesting.\"\nI actually don't think you\nwant to contact the red lights\ndirectly to your skin.\nSo red light is powerful.\nI don't think we have, aside\nfrom the vision protocol,\nI don't think that it's clear\nwhich protocols are best.\nI will say if you're into\nred light infrared sauna.\nTypically those don't get hot enough.\nTypically if you want to\nget the benefits of sauna,\nyou want to get between 80\nand 100 degrees Celsius,\nwhich is 176 to 210 or 208 Fahrenheit.\nAnd I don't actually do\nthe conversion in my head.\nI memorize it.\n\"You mentioned the consequences\nof blasting your brain\nwith too much dopamine.\nIs it possible to overdo\nice baths while following\nthe same line of thinking?\nWill you experience an\nextreme low in dopamine\nwith too many ice baths?\"\nLucas Ancke, thank you for the question.\nAny behavior that spikes adrenaline,\nyou will eventually get\nbetter at tolerating it.\nYou will become cold adapted\nand you'll become comfortable\nat high adrenaline states.\nAnd you just have to ask yourself this,\nit's just like lifting\nweights in the gym or running.\nYou need to leave some\nspace for improvement.\nSo if you run, as people do,\nand you do your 5k, then you're 10k,\nthen you're half marathon,\nmaybe a 10k is a half marathon.\nI don't know.\nBut anyway, then you're\ndoing your marathon.\nThen you're doing ultras that\nare 50 miles and 100 miles.\nI mean, eventually you're going\nto start doing damage, right?\nAnd eventually you look\nat every ultra runner\nand typically these are\npeople who are very much\non the dopamine pursuit system.\nI mean, I don't think that he would mind;\nmy good friend and a podcaster\nwho I have tremendous\nrespect for is Rich Roll,\namazing human being,\nand also has an amazing\nstory about addiction.\nHe was an alcoholic.\nAnd I'm not sharing anything\nthat he hasn't already shared\nin his amazing book, \"Finding Ultra.\"\nHe got really into running,\nrunning, running all the time\nand there's a dopamine\nhistory there for him.\nSome of us can use ice\nbaths so consistently\nand making it so cold and\ndoing them longer and longer\nthat indeed you're playing\nwith the dopamine system.\nIs it bad?\nWell, it depends on what\nyou're trading that in for,\nat the expense of what?\nIs it giving up cocaine?\nYeah, great, stick with the ice bath.\nBut you know, can only make it so cold\nand you can only stay in there so long\nbefore you become Wim Hof, right?\nAnd it worked out for Wim,\nbut there's really only one Wim Hof.\nAnd in general, that\nspeaks to a larger theme,\nwhich is I love the idea\nof people using tools\nand understanding mechanism.\nI mean, of course I love that.\nIt's what I talk about and\nthink about so much in my life.\nBut for most of us,\nwe don't make a living doing those things.\nAnd so I do think that the ideal situation\nis to have behaviors and\ntools that you intersperse\nthroughout your day and\nthroughout the week.\nFor instance, I think\nthree times a week is fine\nfor the ice bath.\nNo one said you had to do it every day,\nbut you should see sunlight\nevery morning if you can.\nJust because if you miss a\nday, your system will be fine,\njust spend twice as long\noutside the next day.\nSeriously, 'cause it's a\nslow integrating system.\nBut for most of these\nhigh intensity things,\nthe less often you do them,\nthe more powerful they are.\nIn fact, if you get into a very hot sauna\nfor four 30 minute sessions on one day.\nSo you go 30 minutes,\nget out for five minutes.\n30 minutes, get out for five minutes.\n30 minutes, get out for five.\nTwo hours a day in the\nsauna, that's a lot of sauna,\nbut the growth hormone release\nfrom that type of protocol\nis a 16x increase in growth hormone.\nThis has been measured in humans.\nWhereas if you do it every day\nor three or four times a week,\nyou get diminishing returns on that.\nSo I actually am a big fan\nof doing really intense stuff\nonly every once in a while.\nThis is also why I only\ntake one long run per week\nor one long hike.\nFirst of all, I don't have time for it.\nI'm not an ultra runner.\nI got other things to do.\nAnd second of all, it's a strong stimulus.\nI'm sore until Tuesday,\nor I don't want to run\nuntil Tuesday anyway.\nI actually think that's fine.\nAnd I actually encourage\nkind of more healthy,\nrational schedules of\nthese kinds of behaviors.\nThere's no rule that says\nyou have to do something\nevery day, even if you're trying\nto engage neuroplasticity.\nYou can learn French or an\ninstrument by practicing\nthree times a week.\nAs long as your practice\nis very focused, right?\nDaily perhaps would be better,\nbut very few of us have the opportunity\nto do things every day consistently.\nAnd I really want to encourage\na more balanced approach.\n\"Before working for\nThrasher, what's the best...\"\nOh, goodness gracious.\nThe skateboarders are always in the house.\nMy first non-biological family\nwas a skateboarding community.\nWhen I have great relationship\nwith my parents now,\nbut because there was a\ntime when there was no one\nto go to soccer games\nor do any of that stuff,\nthe skateboard community took me in\n'cause there were no parents involved.\nIt was great.\nThere were no referees or coaches\n'cause I didn't like\nauthority and it was awesome.\nAnd there was no nutritional plan.\nYou drank your slurpy\nand you sat on the curb,\nand it was fantastic.\nI don't do that anymore.\nBut the skateboarding community's\none that I've remained close with.\nI did write for Thrasher\nunder a different name\nwhile I was a postdoc\nto make some extra cash.\nYou won't find those\narticles anywhere, I hope.\nThey're not very good.\nAnd the best skate trick?\nWell, I was involved in it\nenough that this will only\nmakes sense like three\npeople in the audience,\nbut I had decent heel flip.\nI could nollie better than I could ollie.\nAnd I was never very good.\nOh, there's more\nskateboarders in the audience.\nWhat I will say though,\nis you have to be very\ncareful with skateboarders,\n'cause I don't want to\nclaim that I was any good.\nAny success that I had was\nout of sympathy of others\nfor letting me hang around.\nIt's a great community.\nAnd it gave me great\nappreciation for indeed\ncommunities of kids that\ndon't have structure\nand sports leagues and teams\nand all that kind of stuff.\nNowadays, it's actually a\nmuch different landscape.\nAnd I have to also say that\nit's really amazing to see\nall the incredible girls and\nwomen skateboarders also.\nThere were none.\nIt's an Olympic sport\nnow for women and girls,\nand it's an Olympic sport\nfor boys of men too.\nSo, it's awesome to see that community.\nOkay, \"What are your favorite brain hacks\nfor doing hard things?\nRanging from cold exposure to\ngetting through selection?\"\nHoby Darling, thanks for the question.\nYeah, hard things.\nWell, I'll be honest.\nI learned how to hack\ninto my adrenaline system\na long time ago through the\nworst possible mechanism,\nwhich is that I would set\nup battles in my mind.\nI would get into competition\nwith people, imagined or real,\nor I would get into states of\nfearing shame and screwing up.\nSo, this is what a lot\nof people do I think,\nyou end up scaring\nyourself into trying to do\nthe hard thing, and it works.\nThe problem is it feels\nrather like a downward spiral\nbecause those negative states of mind\nwork to liberate adrenaline and\nget you through hard things.\nSo being a kind of rebellious\nkid, resistance was...\nIf someone told me I couldn't\ndo something, I was like,\n\"Yeah, try me\" and this kind of thing.\nAnd as I mentioned before, I\nwasn't crazy about authority.\nAnd so, that was the\nmethod for a long time.\nAnd then, I started reading\nOliver Sacks's books\nand I started learning\nfrom people who seemed\nto access things through\nthis whole love thing.\nAnd I tried that love and\nkindness meditation thing,\nand that didn't work.\nAnd what I started doing was I actually,\nI'll just tell you before\nI came out here tonight\nand before I do anything challenging,\nI just actually like to imagine the people\nthat have supported me.\nIt's a weird tool.\nI don't think I've ever shared.\nI'm actually slightly\nembarrassed to share this out.\n'Cause there are only two\nthings that make me cry,\nand that's talking about my bulldog\nand talking about my graduate advisor.\nAnd if I talk it about any\nlonger, I'll probably cry.\nBut I think about them a lot\nbecause they were kind of similar.\nThey were kind of ornery\nand they were hard on me,\nand I adored them both.\nAnd so these days I try\nand think about people\nthat really, that I love.\nAnd so I have been trying\nto do this whole, like,\ndoing things from a place of love thing.\nAnd so, for me, that's animals\nand people that I love.\nAnd okay, now, I better move on.\nAh, thank you.\n[audience applauding]\nOkay, they're telling\nme one more question.\nSo I'm going to answer one more.\n\"What do I fear?\nHow do you manage your fear?\"\nKB, oh, gosh.\nThis is going to turn into a\nno one's going to be satisfied\nuntil I cry.\nI get it, I get it.\n[audience laughing]\nI do cry, but again about the\nthings I mentioned before.\nI realized something, by the way.\nWe just recorded an episode on grief.\nIt hasn't come out yet.\nFascinating topic.\nI realized at one point, by the way,\nI'll just give this away,\nthat I thought I was really\nsad about losing them.\nI thought I would tear up really easily\nbecause I was sad about them.\nBut then I realized that this,\ngosh, I can't believe\nI'm going to do this.\nBut I realized that\nfeeling that I was feeling\nis the exact same feeling of love\nthat I had when they were alive.\nSo, grief is love.\nAnd when you look at the literature,\nit's basically that, but\nyour brain is freaking out\nbecause that map of knowing\nwhere people are in space\nand time, grief is basically\na remapping of the space:\nWhere are they?\nTime: When are they?\nAnd then, this kind of\nabstract map representation\nthat we call closeness.\nAnd grief is this process of\nripping ourselves off of that.\nSo, in any event, what do I fear?\nTalking about things like this.\nWhat do I fear?\nQuite honestly, my biggest fear,\nthe thing that would just\nmake me feel just horrible\nis I fear letting down my friends.\nI have an amazing...\nI love my family and they're wonderful,\nbut I have this incredible\nrelationship to friendship,\nand I adore my friends\nand I would sooner give up\nall my limbs and die before I would\ndeliberately let them down.\nSo, there you go, that's what I fear most.\n[audience applauding]\nThank you.\nThank you.\nI also fear I've gone long.\nAnd so my team has shut this down.\nI just want to just briefly, two things.\nFirst of all, I of course\nwant to thank everyone\nfor coming here tonight.\nI realize it's the middle of the week\nand to commit some hours of your life\nto thinking about these brain mechanisms,\nwe got pretty nerdy there for a minute,\nand hopefully the tools redeemed those\nwho were only interested\nor mostly interested\nin practical tools,\nbut hopefully some of the\ninsights about how you work\nwere useful as well.\nI do want to just make brief\nmention of the sponsors\nthat made this possible, 'cause\nthey did make this possible.\nAnd we made every effort to\ntry and keep the ticket prices\nmanageable for people.\nAnd thanks to InsideTracker and Momentous\nfor making this possible.\nAnd then, of course I\nwould be completely remiss\nif I didn't say thank you\nfor your interest in science.\n[audience applauding]\n[audience cheering]\nThank you.\nThank you.\nOh, wow, thank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\nThank you.\n[light music]\nThanks so much.\nEveryone be sure to get\nhome safely tonight."
