    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are going to be\ndiscussing bipolar disorder,\noften called bipolar depression.\nBipolar depression is a condition\nin which people undergo massive shifts\nin their energy, their\nperception, and their mood.\nHowever, it is very important to note\nthat these shifts in mood,\nenergy, and perception\nare all maladaptive.\nThey can often cause tremendous damage\nto the person suffering\nfrom bipolar disorder\nand tremendous damage to\nthe people in their lives.\nToday we are going to parse the biology\nthat leads to these shifts in\nmood, energy, and perception.\nAnd we are going to talk\nabout the various treatments that exist.\nSome of those treatments have been around\nfor a very long time,\nand indeed one of those\ntreatments, lithium,\nhas an incredible backstory\nabout its discovery\nand in understanding how lithium works\nand some of the ways in\nwhich it does not work well,\nit reveals a tremendous amount\nabout how the brain works\nnormally in all individuals.\nSo that's a miraculous\nstory that I look forward\nto sharing with you.\nAs we go forward in this\ndiscussion about bipolar disorder,\nI want everyone to keep in mind\nthat it is a very severe condition.\nIn fact, people suffering\nfrom bipolar disorder\nare at 20 to 30 times\ngreater risk of suicide.\nSo today is a serious discussion\nand it's certainly one in which people\nwho are suffering from\nmanic bipolar disorder\nor who know people that are suffering\nfrom manic bipolar\ndisorder can benefit from.\nHowever, for those of you\nthat might know people\nor who themselves suffer\nfrom major depression,\nwe will also be talking about important\ntreatment developments\nfor major depression.\nMajor depression is a very\ncommon thing for many people.\nIn fact, most people will\nsuffer from depression\nof some sort at some point in their life,\nalthough not necessarily a\nmajor depressive episode,\nand yet major depression is very common.\nSo you'll soon learn up to 20% of people\nwill suffer from major depression.\nSo today's discussion will\nencompass all of that.\nAnd it will also encompass\nbasic brain mechanisms\nof neuroplasticity, the\nbrain's ability to change\nin response to experience\nboth for good and for worse.\nAnd you'll learn a lot\nabout the basic biology\nof how the brain regulates\nmood, energy, and perception.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nWe often talk about supplements\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nand while supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like enhancing\nthe quality and speed\nwith which you get into sleep,\nor for enhancing focus\nor for hormone support.\nThe reason we partnered\nwith Momentous Supplements\nis several fold.\nFirst of all, their supplements\nare of the absolute highest quality.\nSecond of all, they ship internationally\nwhich is important because\nmany of our podcast listeners\nreside outside the US.\nThird, many of the supplements\nthat Momentous makes\nand most all of the supplements\nthat we partnered with them directly on\nare single ingredient formulations.\nThis is important for a number of reasons.\nFirst of all, if you're going to create\na supplement protocol that's\ncustomized for your needs,\nyou want to be able to figure\nout which supplement ingredients\nare most essential and only use those\nand supplements that\ncombine lots of ingredients\nsimply won't allow you to do that.\nIf you'd like to see the supplements\nthat we partnered with Momentous on,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,\nand there you'll see\nmany of the supplements\nthat we've talked repeatedly about\non the Huberman Lab Podcast episodes.\nI should mention that the\ncatalog of supplements\nthat are available at\nlivemomentous.com/Huberman\nis constantly being expanded\nSo you can check back there,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman\nto see what's currently available.\nAnd from time to time, you'll notice\nnew supplements being\nadded to the inventory.\nBefore we dive into the discussion\nabout manic bipolar disorder,\nI want to highlight some recent findings\nin an area totally\nseparate from mental health\nthat I think are really\nimportant for everyone\nto know about.\nThis is a paper published\nin the journal Cell,\nwhich is a Cell Press\nJournal, an excellent journal.\nIn fact, one of the three apex journals.\nSo for those of you that are curious,\npapers published in the journal\nNature, Science and Cell\nare considered the sort of Super Bowl,\nStanley Cup, and NBA\nchampionships of publishing.\nAnd this paper entitled,\nan inter-organ neural circuit\nfor appetite suppression illustrates\na very important principle\nthat I think everyone\nshould know about,\nand that's the principle of\nso-called parallel pathways.\nParallel pathways, as the name suggests,\nare pathways, they\ncould be neural pathways\nor hormonal pathways or otherwise\nthat operate independently of one another\nto accomplish a common goal.\nAnd what this paper really shows\nis that there's a set\nof peptides in the body\nand the peptide that\nI'm referring to today\nis called GLP-1, Glucagon-like peptide-1,\nand some related peptides.\nI've talked about these\non the podcast before\nfor two reasons.\nFirst of all, I'm a big\nproponent and consumer\nof yerba mate.\nYerba mate is a tea that\ncan promote the release\nof glucagon-like peptide-1.\nAnd there are also new prescription drugs\nthat are now hitting the market.\nAnd for which there are really\nimpressive clinical trials\nfor diabetes and obesity\nthat are essentially glucagon-like\npeptide-1 stimulator,\nso they stimulate the release of that,\nor they are in fact, a synthetic version\nof glucagon-like peptide-1.\nwhat is glucagon-like peptide-1?\nIt is a peptide, which is\na small little protein,\nthat can dramatically suppress appetite.\nSo that's why these\ndrugs are being explored\nand are showing quite impressive results\nfor things like treatment\nof type 2 diabetes\nand other forms of diabetes,\nas well as obesity.\nSo they lead to weight loss.\nNow in terms of the yerba mate stimulation\nof glucagon-like peptide-1,\nthat's going to be a much lower amount\nof glucagon-like peptide-1 that's released\nfrom drinking yerba\nmate as opposed to say,\ntaking a drug that stimulates GLP-1\nor taking a drug that is GLP-1.\nNonetheless, should also point out\nthat yerba mate comes in a\nbunch of different forms.\nThere is some concern about\ncertain smokey-flavored forms\nof yerba mate being carcinogenic,\nso that's why I avoid\nthose forms of yerba mate.\nBut for me, yerba mate is one\nof the preferred sources of caffeine.\nFor me, I like the way it tastes.\nIt does provide that sort of caffeine kick\nthat I like to have early in the day\nfor focus and for work and for exercise.\nAnd yet I actively avoid\nthe smoked varieties\nof yerba mate because of the potential\ncarcinogenic effects of\nthe smoked varieties.\nGlucagon-like peptide-1,\nas I mentioned earlier,\ncan suppress appetite.\nBut what this paper shows is it does that\nby at least two mechanisms\nthrough parallel pathways.\nWhat this paper shows is\nthat glucagon-like peptide-1\naxon receptors in the body in a portion\nof the nervous system called\nthe enteric nervous system,\nE-N-T-E-R-I-C, enteric nervous system.\nThis is a component of your nervous system\nthat you don't really have control over,\nit's autonomic or automatic.\nGLP-1 binds to what are called\nintestinofugal enteric neurons,\nyou don't need to know the name,\nbut those neurons do two things.\nFirst of all, they cause\nsome gut distension,\nso they actually make you feel full.\nThis is incredible, right?\nA peptide, not actual physical food,\nbut a peptide that stimulates neurons\nthat cause changes in the\nso-called mechanoreceptors\nof the gut, of the enteric nervous system\nand make people feel full.\nSo it can lead to actually mild,\nor I suppose if levels\nof GLP-1 are very high,\nto major gut distension.\nI think that the levels\nof GLP-1 that would come\nfrom drinking yerba mate\nand hopefully from appropriate dosaging of\nthe synthetic forms of GLP-1\nor drugs that stimulate\nGLP-1 would cause mild,\nnot major, gut distension,\n'cause major gut distension\nwould be uncomfortable.\nSo GLP-1 is acting at the level of gut\nto increase gut distension,\nand by way of a pathway\nthat goes from the gut\nup to the hypothalamus, this\nlittle cluster of neurons\nabout the size of a marble that sits above\nthe roof of your mouth, is\nalso suppressing appetite\nthrough brain mechanisms.\nSo this is really beautiful, right?\nYou have a peptide, a small little protein\nthat's released in the gut\nand that release within the\ngut causes gut distension,\nwhich makes you feel full.\nAnd by way of neural\nstimulation of the hypothalamus\nalso activates neural\npathways within the brain\nthat trigger satiety, the feeling\nof having had enough food.\nSo to me, GLP-1 is both\nimpressive and important.\nWhy?\nBecause this recent category of drugs\nthat's now hitting the market\nseems to adjust obesity or can\nhelp people with weight loss\nin order to help their health.\nAnd it's doing so by at\nleast two mechanisms.\nOne is within the brain, and\nthe other is within the gut\nand communication through the\nso-called gut brain access.\nBecause again, these enteric neurons\nare communicating to the\nbrain, the hypothalamus,\nby way of this, what's called\nthe\nsympatho-gastro-spinal-reticular-hypothalamic\npathway,\nyou absolutely do not\nneed to know all of that.\nThat's a mouthful,\nthat's enough to make\nyour mouth feel distended.\nBut at the same time,\nthings like yerba mate,\nand I'm sure there are other\ncompounds out there as well,\nbut certainly yerba mate can\nstimulate the release of GLP-1.\nSo for those of you that are looking\nfor some mild appetite suppression\nand want to accomplish that\nwhile also ingesting caffeine,\nyerba mate might be a\ngood option for that.\nAnd just know that it's\noperating through two mechanisms,\non the body through mild gut distension\nto make you feel full,\nand on the brain to increase satiety\nand make you feel less hungry.\nAnd then for everybody, not just those\nthat are interested in\nappetite suppression,\nI think it's important to understand\nthat these parallel\npathways are fundamental\nto how we are organized.\nAnother good example of this would be\nwhen we are excited by\nsomething positive or negative,\nso it could be stressful or\nwe are positively aroused,\nthere is a parallel activation\nof epinephrine, adrenaline,\nboth from your adrenals and\nfrom an area in the brain\ncalled the locus coeruleus.\nSo again and again, we see this in biology\nand in neuroscience that\nyour brain and your body\nare acting in concert.\nThey're acting together through mechanisms\nthat either are independent,\nso separately in the brain\nand separately in the body,\nbut directed towards a common goal,\nor through communication\nbetween brain and body,\nand almost always that communication\nis going to be bidirectional,\nbody to brain and brain to body.\nSo I think these results\nare really interesting\nand really important\nfor sake of weight loss,\nfor sake of appetite suppression,\nand just generally for the\nway that they illustrate\nthis very important theme\nof the way that we are constructed\nat a biological level\nwhich is parallel pathways.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that\ntheme, I'd like to thank\nthe sponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed with\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for instance,\nwhat your biological age is\nand compare that to\nyour chronological age.\nAnd of course your biological age\nis the one that's important\nfor your longevity\nand your understanding of\nyour current health needs.\nOne major problem with most blood tests\nand DNA tests out there however,\nis that you get information\nback about levels\nof metabolic factors, levels\nof hormones and lipids\nand so forth, but you don't know exactly\nwhat to do with that information.\nInsideTracker solves that problem\nthrough their personalized platform\nwhich can tell you, for instance,\nlifestyle factors like\nfitness or nutrition\nor supplementation that you can use\nto bring the numbers into the ranges\nthat are ideal for your health needs.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's

by\ntwo all-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent a lifetime working\non the biology of the visual system\nand I can tell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with a number\nof very important challenges\nin order for you to see clearly.\nThe designers of ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nunderstand this\nand for that reason, ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nallow you, for instance, to move\nfrom a shady area to a bright area\nor from a bright area to a shady area\nand still see everything\nwith crystal clarity.\nOriginally, their glasses and sunglasses\nwere designed for performance,\nthat is for running and cycling,\nand as a consequence, the\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nstay on your face even if you get sweaty\nand they're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, most of the\ntime, I don't even realize\nthat they're on my face.\nI wear ROKA eyeglasses for\nreading and for driving at night\nand I wear their sunglasses\nwhen I'm out during the day\nand it's really bright and\nI need to use sunglasses\nin order to be able to navigate\nin that bright sunlight.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nglasses, you can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com, and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com\nand enter

takeaways that you\ncan read or listen to.\nI'm a big believer in\nreading physical books,\nI actually own a lot of hard cover books\nand paperback books and I\nlike holding them my hand\nand flipping through the pages.\nI also like listening to audiobooks.\nBut the reality is I don't have\na ton of time to read books\nand I don't have a lot of time\nto listen to entire audiobooks.\nThere are also a lot of books\nthat I've really enjoyed\nin the past that I have\nread in their entirety\nbut then I like to update myself\non the information on\nevery once in a while.\nBlinkist has terrific books available.\nFor instance, I'm a big fan\nof Tim Ferris's 4-Hour Body,\ngleaned So much knowledge from that book.\nAlso from Nassim Taleb's\nbook, The Black Swan\nand the great Matt Walker's\nbook, Why We Sleep,\nwhich is a book that\nI've read several times\nand I actually listen to the synopsis of\non Blinkist over and over\nbecause there's so many key takeaways.\nWith Blinkist you get unlimited access\nto read or listen to a massive library\nof condensed non-fiction books,\nessentially all of the books\nthat you ever wanted to listen to,\nand now you have time\nbecause they're condensed\ndown to just 15 minutes each.\nRight now, Blinkist has a special offer\njust for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.\nIf you go to blinkist.com/huberman,\nyou can get a free seven-day trial\nand you can get 20% off a\nBlinkist premium membership.\nThat's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,\nblinkist.com/huberman to get 25% off\nand a seven-day free trial.\nLet's talk about bipolar disorder.\nAnd today I'm going to\nrefer to bipolar disorder\ninterchangeably with bipolar depression,\nalthough as you will soon learn,\nnot everyone with bipolar disorder\nnecessarily goes through highs and lows.\nThere is a subset of people who suffer\nfrom bipolar disorder who\nexperience the manic phases,\nthe highly elevated mood and energy,\nand then drop down to so-called baseline,\nso they don't necessarily go\ndown into a depressive state.\nThey often will return to\na somewhat normal state.\nIn fact, we will talk about\nthe percentage of time\nthat people with bipolar disorder\ntend to be symptom-free manic or depressed\nin the context of the different categories\nof bipolar disorder.\nBut as we wade into this topic\nthat is bipolar disorder,\nI just want to give you a little bit\nof the background statistics\nto anchor us in just how\nserious and prevalent\nbipolar disorder is.\nSo bipolar disorder\nimpacts about 1% of people,\nthat might seem like a small percentage,\nbut if you think about a\nroom of a hundred people,\nthat means that at least one of them\nis very likely to have bipolar disorder.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier\nin the introduction,\nbipolar disorder is very serious.\nIt has a 20 to 30% greater\nincidence of suicide\nthan the general population, which is,\nfirst of all, extremely tragic\nand extremely concerning.\nSo anyone that thinks they\nmight have bipolar disorder\nor who knows someone with bipolar disorder\nshould be especially vigilant about this.\nAnd we'll talk about some of the,\nor signs and risk factors, age of onset,\net cetera, as we move forward.\nSo 1% of people have bipolar disorder.\nThe typical age of onset\nis anywhere from 20\nto 25 years old, although\nit can be much earlier.\nAnd the earlier the onset\nof a bipolar episode,\nwhich we will define in a few minutes,\nthe earlier the onset of that episode,\nthe higher likelihood\nthat the bipolar disorder\nis going to be a stable feature\nof that person's psychology going forward.\nAnd yet, I also want to point out\nthat there are some very good treatments\nfor bipolar disorder that those people\ncould still benefit from.\nThere are basically two\nkinds of bipolar disorder\nreferred to as bipolar 1 and bipolar 2.\nSo let's just talk about bipolar 1 first.\nBipolar 1 is characterized by\na fairly extended period of mania.\nWhat is mania?\nMania is a period of very elevated mood,\nenergy, distractibility, impulsivity,\nand some other symptomology\nthat we'll talk about\ngoing forward.\nBut this manic episode is extreme.\nThis is a condition in\nwhich the energy lift,\nthe mood lift, and the sort of impulsivity\nand actions and words of the person\nsuffering from manic bipolar disorder\nare very noticeable and very extreme.\nNow a key thing, however,\nis that it's not always noticeable\nto the person suffering from it\nthat they are in this mode.\nSometimes they recognize\nthat, sometimes they don't,\nbut it's always highly\nrecognizable to other people\nthat the person suffering\nfrom manic bipolar disorder\nis not like other people.\nSo let's talk about bipolar\n1 in a little bit more depth.\nOne of the key clinical criteria\nor diagnostic criteria for bipolar 1\nis that a person suffer\nfrom these manic episodes\nor display these manic episodes\nfor seven days or more.\nThat turns out to be very key.\nThe stability of that manic episode\nfor seven days or more turns\nout to be very important.\nAnd for those seven days,\nthe person is in an elevated mood,\nexpansive thought all day,\nevery day for those seven days.\nNow there are a lot of reasons\nwhy somebody could be in a manic mode.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat somebody has bipolar disorder.\nIn fact, someone could be in a manic mode\nfor seven days or more\nand still not be diagnosed\nwith bipolar disorder.\nWhy?\nWell, there are other things\nthat can create manic episodes,\nthings like traumatic brain\ninjury, things like seizure,\nthings like various prescription\ndrugs or illicit drugs,\nthings like amphetamine and cocaine,\nthat is not the same as bipolar disorder\neven though from a\nsymptomology perspective,\nthey might look even identical.\nSo let's think about these symptoms\nand the diagnostic criteria\nthat a psychiatrist would use\nin order to ask whether\nor not someone is manic\nbecause they have manic\nby bipolar disorder\nor whether or not that person is manic\nfor some other reason, such\nas traumatic brain injury,\nillicit drugs, et cetera.\nSo typically a person would\nbe brought into a clinic\nor a person would bring\nthemselves to a clinic\nor meet with a psychiatrist,\nit seems more likely that\nthey would be directed\ntoward a psychiatrist because oftentimes\npeople who are in a manic episode\njust simply won't have the perspective\nor the foresight to bring\nthemselves into the clinic.\nAnd the psychiatrist is\ngoing to start to evaluate\nfor a couple of different things.\nBut first of all, what they're\ngoing to try and figure out\nis whether or not the\nperson has at least three\nof the following symptoms.\nThe first symptom is distractibility.\nIs the person distractable?\nAre they going from one thing to the next.\nPeople who are in a manic episode\nwill be talking about a pen\nand then they'll be talking\nabout something they saw\nthe other day and then\nsomething they want to purchase\nand then a place they're\ngoing to travel to, et cetera,\nbut they are also very\nprone to any stimulus\nwithin the room.\nMeaning a bell could go off\nor there could be a\nsound out in the hallway\nand they'll orient to that.\nAnd then they'll orient to the clinician\nand then they'll orient to\nsomething in their pocket,\nso they're all over the place.\nYou could think of this\na little bit like ADHD\nor attention-deficit disorder,\nbut it's very extreme.\nSo highly distractable,\nhighly impulsive, impulsivity\nrelates to actions.\nSo the person might be\nfidgeting with something\nand then they might try and leave the room\nor the person might, if they\nwere out in the real world,\nsomebody might notice that the person\nis going and purchasing\nmultiples of something that\nwould be unusual for someone\nto purchase.\nSo for instance, I happen to know someone\nwhose ex-spouse had bipolar disorder\nand their ex-spouse went out and bought\n10 plus air fryers.\nI mean, I think unless you're a restaurant\nthat's using a lot of air fryers,\nthe idea that you would need more than one\nor two air fryers might\njust seem a little bit\nout of the norm.\nAnd so that impulsivity can be purchasing,\nit can be other things as well.\nIt can be booking 12 international\ntrips in one afternoon\nor going and buying three cars, et cetera.\nSo impulsivity.\nthe other is grandiosity.\nPeople who have manic bipolar disorder\nwho are in a manic\nepisode will often display\nwords of or actions of grandiosity.\nAnd keep in mind, these are not lies\nin the sense that the person isn't lying\nin order to try and pull\none over on anybody,\nthese are actual beliefs\nthat the person comes to have\nabout their grandiose\nposition in the world\nor grandiose opportunities\nor potential in the world.\nTypical forms of grandiosity\nand manic episodes\nwould be that the person suddenly decides\nthat they are going to\nwin a Pulitzer Prize.\nThey are the person selected\nto win a Pulitzer Prize.\nThey're going to write\na novel that afternoon,\nand they're going to win a\nPulitzer Prize that year,\nwhich is more or less\na delusion of grandeur.\nThe idea that someone could\ndo that in one afternoon,\nI suppose it is possible in\nthe realm of all possibilities,\nbut it's extremely unlikely.\nOther forms of grandiosity\nthat often present themselves\nin people suffering from a manic episode\nwill be that they're\ngoing to run for president\nor that they are the\nperson that they believe\nis selected by the\ncitizens of a given country\nor by the universe to be the\npresident of that country\nor to be present of the universe.\nIt sounds ridiculous, but\nthose sorts of delusions\nof grandiosity are one condition\nthat often presents itself,\nor one set of symptoms\nthat presents itself.\nFlight of ideas are also\ntypical of manic episodes.\nSo this is a little bit\nlike distractibility,\nbut this would be people\ntalking extensively\nabout one thing and then switching\nand talking extensively\nabout something else.\nIt would be as if I was doing this podcast\ntalking about manic bipolar disorder\nand then suddenly switching to OCD\nand then to deliberate cold exposure\nand then to the role of sugar\nand its impact on the brain, et cetera.\nSo essentially a random selection\nof the different topics\nthat exist in science,\nall of which I happen\nto be very interested in\nand curious about,\nbut just as we have\nepisodes of the podcast\nthat are about one or two topics,\nand we focus on those in\na fairly narrow trench\nof discussion,\nsomebody who has a flight of ideas\nwould be jumping between\ncategories and topics\nin a kind of pseudo random way.\nSo they might take off\ndown a path of one thing\nand then switch to another\nwithout any transition\nor with transitions that that don't have\nany logical structure to them.\nThe other aspect of manic bipolar disorder\nthat often presents itself\nin the manic episodes\nare agitation.\nPeople feeling extremely\nphysically agitated,\nso a lot of shaking and moving about.\nThis can venture into\nthe realm of paranoia,\nbut a lot of agitation,\na difficulty sitting down and being still,\na difficulty in just looking,\nfeeling and acting calm.\nAnd then another condition is no sleep.\nAnd when I say no sleep, I mean no sleep\nor very minimal sleep.\nAs incredible as it sounds,\npeople who are in a manic episode\ncan often go seven days\nor more with zero sleep.\nAnd a key feature of this zero sleep\nis that they're not troubled by it.\nThey're not thinking, oh,\nI'm suffering from insomnia\nand I really, really want to sleep.\nSometimes that's the case,\nbut more often than not,\nthey are simply not sleeping.\nThey're staying up 24 hours\nthen another 24 hours,\nit just continues for an entire week.\nAgain, inconceivable to those of us\nthat don't suffer from manic episodes.\nI can only imagine how pulled\napart most of us would feel\nunder those conditions,\nand yet they are just going\nand going and going with no sleep,\nup all hours, shopping, talking, running,\ndoing all sorts of different\nthings in the categories\nof other symptoms that\nwe talked about before.\nAnd it doesn't bother them\nthat they're not sleeping.\nAnd then the last sort\nof category of symptoms\nthat the psychiatrist is evaluating for\nand seeing if they present\nis rapid pressured speech.\nThe rapid pressured speech is something\nthat when you hear it, you recognize it.\nThis is somebody that almost\nseems to be hitting you\nwith speech like machine gun fire,\nit's coming at you, coming\nat you, coming at you\nand there's really no\nroom for conversation.\nThey're not offering any opportunity\nfor a back and forth, or if\nthere is a back and forth,\nthey might ask you how\nyou feel about something\nand then you started, well, I,\n[speaking gibberish]\nthen they're going to hit\nyou with another barrage\nor a paragraph of information\nor of just speech, that pseudo random.\nSo we've got distractibility, impulsivity,\ngrandiosity, flight of ideas, agitation,\nno sleep, and rapid pressured speech.\nFor someone to be diagnosed\nas in a manic episode,\nthey do not have to be engaging in\nor displaying all of those symptoms.\nThey do however need to present\nat least three of those symptoms,\nand then in order to meet\nthe condition of bipolar 1,\nthey have to be presenting\nthose three symptoms\nfor at least seven days.\nIt could be longer, but\nat least seven days.\nNow, this seems pretty\nstraightforward, right?\nAt one level, the way that I describe this\nand the way that it exists\nin the clinical literature,\nyou could think, well,\nthis should be pretty easy to diagnose.\nAnd yet there's a complication there\nor a challenge there because\nthe psychiatrist, again,\nhas to determine that these manic episodes\nare not due to something\nother than bipolar disorder.\nFor instance, again, it could be TBI,\ntraumatic brain injury,\nit could be seizures,\nor meds or other sorts of drugs.\nCorticosteroids, which\nare often prescribed\nfor a number of immune\nconditions or for wound healing\ncan also cause manic episodes.\nSo they have to determine that everything\nthat's happening meets the\ncriteria I described before,\nthree out of seven of\nthese symptom categories\nfor seven days or more\nand that it can't be better explained\nby something else going\non in that person's life\nor immediate medical history.\nThat's very important.\nNow, the other challenge,\nand this is something\nthat's going to come up\nagain and again today, not\njust in the description\nof the biology of bipolar disorder,\nbut also the description\nof different treatments\nand treatment approaches,\nis that typically, when\nsomebody is sitting\nin front of a psychiatrist,\nin particular for the first time\nthose two people are interacting,\nthe psychiatrist is just\ngetting one snapshot\nof the person at that moment.\nSo the person could be on\nday one of a manic episode,\nthe person might be on day\nsix of a manic episode,\nthe person could be transitioning\nout of a manic episode,\nor the person could be\nsuffering from a combination\nof manic episode where,\nbecause of the impulsivity\nof bipolar disorder,\nthey went out and used illicit drugs.\nThey also used cocaine.\nSo the psychiatrist has\na serious challenge.\nThe psychiatrist has to determine\nbased on a conversation,\nthis isn't a blood test,\nthis isn't a measurement\nthat you can take on a scale\nor with a biomarker, they\nhave to use language,\na conversation with somebody\nwho, by all accounts,\nis pretty impaired at conversation\nto determine whether or not\nthey're suffering from a manic episode\nthat is the consequence\nof bipolar disorder.\nYou can imagine this in the real world,\nas somebody says, well,\nhow long has it been\nsince you slept?\nAnd the person starts to answer,\noh, well, the other day I\nwent down to the basement.\nI was going to get something out of\nthe refrigerator and I\nthought I might take a nap.\nAnd then all of a sudden they're talking\nabout something completely different.\nSo they might not even have an answer.\nSo the psychiatrist has to\nbe a really good detective,\na benevolent detective,\nbut a detective nonetheless\nin determining whether or not\nthese symptoms have existed\nfor seven days or more,\nand whether or not they\nmeet the, at least three,\nit could be more, but at least three\nof the criteria of symptom categories\nI talked about before.\nNow, assuming that they do,\nassuming that the patient\nmeets those criteria,\nthey are likely to be\ndiagnosed with bipolar 1.\nNow bipolar 1 disorder\nmeans they're having these\nextended manic episodes,\nseven days or more,\nbut it does not necessarily mean\nthat they are dropping into\na depressive episode as well.\nThis is a common misconception\nabout bipolar disorder\nbecause as it's often called,\nbipolar disorder is referred\nto as bipolar depression,\nand yet many people with bipolar disorder\ndon't necessarily experience\nthe deep depressive episodes.\nMany of them do, but many of them do not.\nSo somebody can truly\nbe diagnosed accurately\nwith bipolar one,\neven though they're only\nexperiencing manic episodes\nand then dropping down to baseline.\nManic episode, then\ndropping down to baseline.\nThat's very important to understand.\nNow, the second category of\nbipolar disorder is bipolar 2.\nSo BP-II or bipolar disorder\n2 is somewhat different\nthan bipolar disorder 1.\nFirst of all, it's\ncharacterized most often\nby the presence of both\nmanic episodes, mania,\nand depressive episodes,\nor what's referred to as hypomania.\nNow, anytime in biology or\nin medicine you hear hypo,\nit's the opposite of hyper.\nSo we've got normal hyper and hypo.\nHypomania is a somewhat\nsuppressed level of mania.\nSo this is not going to be as extreme\nas the mania that we typically think of.\nAnd yet the hypo can\nbe due to the duration,\nnot the intensity of mania.\nThat's right.\nHypomania can mean a\nlessened intensity of mania,\nbut it can also be used to refer to\na shorter duration of mania.\nAnd in fact, that's\none of the key criteria\nfor bipolar 2.\nBipolar 2 is often diagnosed\non the basis of the\npresence of manic episodes\nthat are lasting four days or even less.\nSo someone with BP-II might have four days\nof this increased energy,\ngoal-directed activity,\nthey're irritable, they're euphoric,\nthey're not sleeping, et cetera,\nbut it's only lasting for about four days.\nOr they could be having longer\nextended periods of mania,\nbut they are hypomanic episodes.\nThey're not quite as intense\nso the pressured speech\nisn't quite as pressured.\nThe impulsivity isn't quite as severe,\net cetera, et cetera.\nThe other aspect of bipolar 2\nis one that I had mentioned\nbriefly a moment ago,\nwhich is that it's often associated\nwith the drops into\nthe depressive episode.\nSo people are going from manic episodes\nfor four days or less,\nthen they're dropping into a depression,\ngoing back to normal, manic again.\nI do want to point out however\nthat people who have\nbipolar 1 can indeed go\nfrom manic episodes to severe,\nwhat we call major depression,\nso they can oscillate like a sine wave,\nreally high highs, really low lows.\nAnd very important to understand\nin terms of understanding\nboth bipolar 1 and bipolar 2\nis that it's not always a sine wave.\nThis is really important\nand it's something that\nfrankly I did not know\nuntil I started researching this episode\nand talking to some psychiatrists.\nI should mention, I've talked to several\nboard certified\npsychiatrists in preparation\nfor this episode,\nI'll give some references to them.\nAnd in fact, some of them\nare going to be coming\non the podcast as guests in the future\nfor more in-depth discussion about bipolar\nand other psychiatric disorders.\nBut all the psychiatrists\nI spoke to confirmed\nwhat the other was saying, which was that\nthe way that bipolar disorder can present\ncan vary tremendously between individuals.\nOne person might go from very high highs\nthat last seven days or more,\nto very low lows.\nBouts of depression, major depression\nthat can last two weeks or more.\nOther people are rapid cycling by way\nof three days manic, three days normal,\nthree days manic, and then dropping\ninto three days depression.\nSo you want to erase\nthat picture in your mind\nthat manic bipolar\ndisorder is this sine wave,\nthis cycling up and down\nbetween mania and depression.\nIt can take a lot of different forms.\nAnd again, this is a serious challenge\nfor the psychiatrist to\ndiagnose people because of that\nfact that they're only getting a snapshot\nof the person unless they've\nknown them for some time\nand are working with them for some time.\nBut this is also especially important\nfor those of you that\neither have bipolar depression\nor suspect that you might,\nor that know someone\nwith bipolar depression\nor suspect somebody might\nhave bipolar depression,\nAKA bipolar disorder.\nBecause if you're noticing that somebody\nis very manic and then normal, well,\nthat's a very different picture\nthan somebody who's going from very manic\nto very deep bouts of depression.\nThe very manic to deep bouts of depression\nis easier to recognize\nbecause of the extremes\nof those highs and lows.\nNow, this might seem somewhat obvious\nto all of you as I describe it,\nand yet it's very important as a, frankly,\na citizen of the planet\nwho knows other human beings\nto keep an eye out for\nthese manic episodes,\nbecause again, whether or\nnot it's four days or less,\nor whether or not it's seven days or more,\nthese manic episodes really\nare the defining criteria\nof bipolar disorder,\nAKA bipolar depression.\nThere are a couple other key features\nabout bipolar 1 and bipolar 2\nthat can allow us to get better insight\ninto whether or not somebody\nhas bipolar 1 or bipolar 2,\nand that's the percentage of time\nthat people with bipolar\n1 versus bipolar 2 spend\nin a manic state, a depressed state,\nor a symptom-free state.\nAnd this is also important to discuss\nbecause it turns out that people\nwith genuine diagnosed bipolar 1\nor bipolar 2 are often symptom-free,\nwhich again can make it difficult\nfor us as people that know them\nor for people that are treating people\nwith bipolar disorder to\nidentify whether or not\nsomebody is in a manic episode\nor a depressive episode,\nor whether or not they\nare headed into a manic\nor depressive episode.\nSo the numbers on this have been studied.\nThis from a paper, actually two papers,\nfirst author, Judd, J-U-D-D et al.\npublished some years ago, 20 years ago,\nbut the data hold up\nreally nicely over time.\nThese were both published\nin Journal American Medical\nAssociation Psychiatry.\nSo JAMA Psychiatry is a superb journal.\nAnd basically people who\nhave bipolar 1 on average\nspend about 50%, it's\nactually 53% was the number\nthat was eventually converged upon,\nbut about 50% of their time symptom-free.\nThat's interesting, right?\nSomebody who has genuine\nbipolar 1 disorder\ncan spend as much as half of their life\nsymptom-free, sleeping normally,\nspeaking normally, et cetera.\nAbout 32% of the time depressed,\nAnd when we say depressed,\nwe mean major depression.\nSo severe challenges with waking up\nat two or three in the morning,\nand having trouble falling back asleep.\nThat's one of the defining\ncharacteristics of depression,\nor sleeping far too much,\nhaving a hard time getting\nout of bed in the morning,\nsuppressed appetite, suppressed libido,\nsuppressed motivation,\nall the general symptoms\nof major depression\nwhich we'll talk about\na little bit more later\nand in an upcoming episode\nabout major depression\nin particular.\nAnd then about 15% of their time\nin this kind of manic\nstate or mixed manic state,\nwhere they are showing\nlong, again, seven days or more bouts\nof sleeplessness, irritability,\npressured speech, grandiosity, et cetera.\nContrast that with people\nwho have bipolar 2 disorder\nwho are spending about half of their time\nin a depressed state.\nSo that's interesting, people\nwith bipolar 2 disorder,\nwhile not always\ndisplaying depressed states\nor oscillations between mania or hypomania\nand depressed states,\nthey tend to be in the\ndepressed state more often.\nAnd again, this is major depression.\nThis isn't just a little bit of a low,\nthis is a serious depression\nof their nervous system,\ntheir mood, and as we say, their affect,\ntheir outlook on life,\nand that's one of the key\ndistinguishing features\nof major depression is that\npeople's outlook on life\nbecomes very diminished in the sense\nthat they don't see a future.\nYou ask them about, how's work going?\nHow're your relationships?\nAnd it's not just that they\nfeel that that's going poorly,\nthey really feel as if\nthere's no opportunity\nfor those things to improve.\nThose people with bipolar 2\ntend to be symptom-free\nabout 45% of the time.\nAgain, these are averages,\nso about 45% of the time,\nthat's a considerable amount of the time.\nAnd they tend to be in\nthese hypomanic states\nonly about 4 or 5% of the time.\nAgain, the criteria for BP-II, bipolar 2\nis these four days or less\nof mania or hypomania,\nbut only 4% of the time or 5% of the time\nis a small enough sliver of the pie\nthat is these people's existence\nthat you could imagine why it would be\neasy for them or other people\nto overlook the fact that\nthey have bipolar disorder\nand not major depression.\nThink about it.\nThis is a person who, or I should say\na collection of people who are spending\nabout half of their time depressed,\nclose to half, 45% of\ntheir time symptom-free,\nand then about 5% of their\ntime in a hypomanic state.\nSo either shorten bouts of\nhigh intensity mania or hypomania\nthat is of reduced intensity.\nOne of the reasons that I\nmentioned these percentages\nof time spent in a\nsymptom-free, depressed manic\nor hypomanic state is\nbecause one of my major goals\nfor today's episode is that\nit will increase awareness\nof whether or not you\nor somebody you know,\ncould be a coworker, could\nbe family member, et cetera,\nmight be suffering from\nbipolar 1 or bipolar 2.\nI think it's fair to say\nthat if somebody is suffering\nfrom bipolar 1,\nthat is likely to be revealed\nor to reveal itself\nbefore too long, because of the fact\nthat people have these\nextended periods of mania\nand mania is such an extreme state,\nnot just for the person\nwho's experiencing it,\nbut the way that it\npresents is just so extreme\nand out of the ordinary.\nBut bipolar 2, you can imagine\ncould really duck under the radar\nof our awareness.\nAnd you could imagine\nthat we might just think\nsomebody is low or depressed,\nespecially if that person\ntends to self-medicate\nwith alcohol or other substances.\nWe might think, oh, they're\ndrinking more than often\nmore than usual, excuse me,\nor they're spending more\ntime alone and isolating.\nBut then when they're in\ntheir hypomanic state,\nthat might actually\npresent as normal to us\nbecause they were in such\na depressed state before.\nSo it's very important that\nwe dial up our awareness,\nthat we have tune our\nantennae to the possibility\nthat people out there who\nmight appear depressed\nor that we haven't heard from in a while\nmight actually be suffering\nfrom bipolar 2 disorder.\nBefore we move into a in-depth discussion\nabout the different kinds of treatments\nfor bipolar disorder,\nI'd like to touch on just\na few additional aspects\nof what bipolar disorder can do\nin terms of its negative consequences.\nAnd also talk about some\nof the inherited risk\nthat is the genetic factors\nand the environmental\nfactors that can contribute\nto bipolar disorder.\nIn terms of the burden,\nthe very real, emotional, and occupational\nand educational burden that can occur\nfor somebody with bipolar disorder,\nthat's actually been studied.\nThere's a measure of this,\nit's called global burden\nwhich is defined as the years lost\nin engaging a normal life\ndue to some disability.\nSo that disability could be cancer\nor that disability, in this\ncase, is bipolar disorder.\nAnd basically the way\nthis sort of study is done\nis that through questionnaires,\nI should say quite\nin-depth questionnaires,\nthere's a probing for whether\nor not somebody has lost\ntwo consecutive weeks or more\nof interest in normal activities.\nNow, for people who have depression,\nthat's a kind of straightforward\nthing to address, right?\nYou ask somebody, when\nwas the last time you ate,\nor when was the last time\nthat you went a few days\nwithout food or lost interest\nin relationships or work or\nsex or things of that sort\nand they answer and you can figure out\nthe amount of time that you've essentially\nbeen withdrawn from normal\nlevels of activity for them.\nWith bipolar disorder, What it turns out\nis that the global burden\nof having bipolar 1\nand even bipolar 2 is massive.\nIn fact, having bipolar disorder\nsits as one of the highest risk factors\nfor being in the top 10\nof all categories of disabilities\nleading to global burden.\nPut in plain English, what that means is\nhaving bipolar 1 or bipolar 2 disorder\nis extremely debilitating.\nIt really slows down one's life trajectory\nunless it's treated properly.\nNow, the other aspect of bipolar disorder\nis its heritability.\nAnd this gets into a little\nbit of some tricky science\nrelated to inheritability versus\nthe genetic contribution\nof a given disease.\nSo that might sound like the same thing,\nyou think, okay, genes\nrelate to heritability,\nheritability relates to genes,\nbut of course, everything about the way\nthat our nervous system\nworks and functions\nand expresses itself,\nhealthy or otherwise,\nis an interaction between our genes\nand our environment.\nAnd so typically the way\nthese studies are done\nis you address what is the risk\nof somebody having a given condition\nin the general population?\nWe talked about that\nbefore, bipolar disorder\nis a 1% of the world's population.\nCompare that to people who\nhave only major depression.\nSo this would be repeated bouts\nof two weeks or more\nof serious depression,\nnot just low mood or\nsomething due to a life loss,\nbut major depression,\nwhich is 10 to 17% of people\nhave major depression.\nThey suffer from major\ndepressive disorder,\ncompared to bipolar disorder\nwhich, again, is 1%.\nNow, you can address how much of the 1%\nof bipolar disorder that exists is due\nto genes versus environment\nin a somewhat exact way.\nThis is never an exact science.\nAnd the way that this is typically done\nis to look at concordance,\nthat is the likelihood\nthat two identical twins\nwill both have a given condition\nas opposed to two fraternal twins,\nwhich have more different genes\nthan identical twins, of course.\nAnd then two siblings who\nhave similar genes, of course,\nbut less similar than\nidentical or fraternal twins\nand so on and so forth.\nSo what you basically do\nis you evaluate the\nprobability that two people\nin the general population\nwho are completely unrelated\nwill have the same\ncondition, versus two people\nin the general population\nwho are very related,\nidentical twins.\nAnd what you find is\nthat in identical twins,\nif one identical twin\nhas true major depression\nor major depressive disorder,\nthere's a 20 to 45% chance\nthat their identical twin will also have\nmajor depressive disorder.\nNow that tells you right there\nthat it can't all be genes,\nthat is not a gene for\nmajor depression per se,\nor if it is a gene or\na collection of genes,\nthat those genes are also subject\nto environmental influences,\neither prenatal, within the womb\nor after children are born.\nNow the large range there of 20 to 45%\ncould be due to any number of things.\nIt could be experimental,\nmeaning the techniques that\nwere used in experiments,\nit could be due to regional differences,\none part of the world versus another.\nThere are a lot of different factors.\nRight now, we probably\nshouldn't delve into all that.\nAt some point, we'll\nprobably do an episode\nall about the genetics of\nnervous system heritability\nand heritability of features\nand mental health, et cetera.\nBut we can compare major\ndepression and the heritability\nor the genetic concordance\nbetween identical twins\nin major depression and\nbipolar disorder and ask,\nif one twin of an identical twin pair\nhas bipolar depression,\nwhat is the likelihood that\nthe other twin will have it?\nAnd it turns out that\nnumber is much higher.\nIt's 40 to 70% likelihood or probability\nthat if one twin has bipolar disorder,\nthat their identical twin will\nalso have bipolar disorder.\nSo again, the total\nincidence of bipolar disorder\nin the general population is much lower\nthan it is for major depressions,\n1% for bipolar versus 10 to\n17% for major depression.\nBut the genetic component is much higher,\n40 to 70% for bipolar disorder\nversus 20 to 45% for major depression.\nI know I'm throwing a\nlot of numbers out there,\nbut basically what this means\nis that researchers have been\nable to take those numbers\nand filter them through a\nnumber of different risk factors\nthat are related to early development,\nask questions like if two\ntwins were raised separately\nor together, or in one part\nof the world versus another,\nor had a two parent household\nversus one parent household,\nevaluate a lot of different variables,\nwhat they were able to discover,\nand this has been shown again and again,\nis that the genetic\ncontribution to bipolar disorder\nis very, very high.\nThat is the heritability\nof bipolar disorder is 85%.\nSo again, I want to be\nreally clear what this means,\nthe total occurrence in the\ngeneral population, fairly low,\nstill serious, 1%,\nbut fairly low compared to other things\nlike major depression.\nHowever, if someone has bipolar disorder,\nit's very likely that they inherited\nsome gene or sets of genes,\nor more accurately, a\nsusceptibility within their genes\nto environmental influences\nthat can trigger bipolar disorder.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent ways to discuss\nand to conceptualize heritability\nso I want to be very careful with the way\nthat I'm wording this.\nWhat this means is that\npeople with bipolar disorder\nvery likely have a gene, or more typically\nit's going to be a set of genes\nthat creates a susceptibility\nfor bipolar disorder\nto present itself.\nNow, what environmental factors trigger\nor increase that susceptibility\nis not entirely clear.\nThis always seems to center back\nonto the same sets of things like\nearly life stress, trauma, et cetera,\ncertainly those are going\nto exacerbate the likelihood\nthat someone who has a genetic propensity\nfor bipolar disorder will express\nthat bipolar disorder\nand its full array of symptomology,\nbut 85%, while very,\nvery high, is not 100%.\nAgain, 85%, while a very high number\nfor heritability is not 100%.\nWhat that means is that\nthere is no single gene\nor identified gene cluster\nfor bipolar disorder.\nThe reason I keep drilling\ninto this over and over\nis that I think we can confidently say\nthat if someone has bipolar disorder,\nthat there was something\nin their genetic lineage\nthat led to that, or that\nvery likely led to that,\nand yet it's not like eye color\nor some other physical feature,\nwhich we can actually do the direct,\nso it's called Mendelian genetics,\nand figure out whether or not somebody\ndirectly inherited that\ngene from one parent\nor the other parent.\nSo the takeaway here is that if you have\ncertainly an identical\ntwin, or a fraternal twin,\nor a sibling or a parent,\nor even a cousin or an uncle\nthat has bipolar disorder,\nin particular bipolar 1,\nwell, then you need to be on the lookout\nfor bipolar disorder, perhaps in yourself\nand for the family members of that person.\nMy goal within this episode up until now\nhas been to provide a\nclear and detailed picture\nof bipolar disorder and its various forms.\nBefore we start to talk about treatments\nfor bipolar disorder and some\nof the neural circuit basis\nfor bipolar disorder,\nI want to make sure that I\ndistinguish bipolar disorder\nfrom borderline personality disorder.\nWe will do an entire episode\nor maybe even several episodes\nabout borderline personality disorder.\nBorderline personality disorder\ncan indeed present itself\nin ways that resemble bipolar\ndisorder and vice versa,\nbut there's some key\ndistinctions that need to be made\nbecause it turns out that bipolar disorder\nand borderline personality disorder\nare quite distinct in terms\nof their defining criteria.\nThe key distinction between somebody\nwith borderline personality disorder\nand bipolar disorder\nis that in borderline\npersonality disorder,\nthere can be episodes that can\nresemble mania or hypomania.\nSo periods of flights of ideas,\nor where people are\nspending money excessively\nor sexually promiscuous in ways\nthat seem manic or could even be\na little bit manic or a lot manic,\nand yet more often than not,\nthere is an environmental trigger\nfor those manic episodes.\nThat is distinctly different\nfrom bipolar disorder\nwhere the person will have manic episodes\nwithout any need for a trigger.\nThere doesn't need to be a call\nfrom someone saying, hey, let's\ngo on a vacation together,\nor there's something coming up this Friday\nthat's really exciting,\nor let's enter a relationship together\nof one form or another.\nThe person with bipolar disorder\nwill have episodes of mania\nor episodes of major depression\nwithout any need for an external stimulus\nor environmental trigger.\nBut the person with borderline\npersonality disorder,\nalmost always, again,\nthere's never an always\nin biology and psychiatry,\nbut almost always is going\nto exhibit flights of mania\nor depressive episodes or\nother types of mood shifts\nthat are dramatic and maladaptive\nin response to things\nthat are coming in through\nthe external environment or relationships\nof some kind.\nIn fact, one of the\ndefining characteristics\nof borderline personality disorder\nis this thing that's\nreferred to as splitting.\nA good example of splitting in a person\nwith borderline personality disorder\nis that they will feel that\nthey absolutely adore you\nand want to spend all their time with you\nand just think the world of you.\nYou can do no wrong.\nAnd in fact, they\ngenuinely can feel that way\nand can genuinely think\nthat way about you.\nAnd then for whatever reason,\nit could be a perception of something\nthat you did or something that you said\nor suspicion that you're\nthinking something about them,\nthey can suddenly shift\nor split their emotions\nin what's called move\nyou from a good object\nor a can do no wrong\nobject to a bad object.\nThey'll suddenly decide that\nyou are cheating on them\nor that you are being mean to them\nor that you're insulting them\nor that something that\nyou're doing is in violation\nto their self worth,\ntheir wellbeing, et cetera\nand that can send them down a pathway\nof being very angry, very\ndepressed, et cetera.\nAs I describe the contour of a person\nwith borderline personality disorder\nas somebody who splits\nvery suddenly in response\nto some environmental\ntrigger, real or perceived,\nthere's the risk, of course,\nthat it makes the person with borderline\npersonality disorder\nsound like a bad person,\nthat they're very volatile.\nAnd while they can be volatile,\nI want to be very careful to point out\nthat the person with\nborderline personality disorder\nis also suffering in this context.\nSo while those sorts of relationships\nwith people with borderline\npersonality disorder,\nwhether or not they're\nromantic relationships\nor familial or coworkers, et cetera,\ncan be very challenged,\ncan be very high friction\nbecause of the good object,\nbad object shifts, et cetera,\nit's bidirectional, meaning the person\nwith borderline personality disorder,\nas you can imagine, is also going through\na lot of suffering.\nAt one moment, they feel\nas if someone is wonderful\nand can do no wrong\nto them and they want to\nbe so strongly affiliated\nwith them, and then in the next moment,\nthey feel as if that\nperson is attacking them\nthrough their actions or even\nthrough their non actions.\nSo again, we will return\nto borderline personality disorder\nin a separate episode,\nit's a serious disorder,\nboth for the person that has it\nand for people around them.\nFortunately, there are\nsome emerging treatments\nthat are showing promise\nand it's a fairly common disorder,\nbut it's important that we distinguish\nborderline personality\ndisorder from bipolar disorder,\nmostly on the basis of\nthis need for a trigger.\nAgain, in bipolar\ndisorder, there is no need\nfor a trigger to create a manic episode\nor a major depressive episode,\nthey just happen or they can just happen.\nWhereas in borderline\npersonality disorder,\nalmost always there's an external trigger\nor a perception that something happened\nin the environment or\nthat somebody is behaving\na certain way that dramatically shifts\nthe person with borderline\npersonality disorder\nfrom one mode to the next.\nAs we move into our discussion\nabout the treatments for\nand neural circuits\nunderlying bipolar disorder,\nI want to just nail\ndown one more key point.\nThis is a very brief point\nbut it's perhaps the most\nimportant point, which is\nthe highs and lows, or\nwe should say the highs,\nthese manic episodes, and sometimes lows,\n'cause again, not everybody\nwith bipolar disorder 1 or 2\nsuffers from depressive episodes,\nsometimes yes, sometimes no,\nin particular in bipolar 2, yes,\nbut people with bipolar 1 can\nhave extreme manic episodes\nand then just return to\nnormal as you recall.\nWell, those extreme lows\nand or extreme highs\nof people with bipolar disorder\nimpact their lives in very negative ways.\nThis is essential and it's something\nthat we're going to return\nto a little bit later\nwhen we talk about the relationship\nbetween bipolar disorder and creativity,\nbecause it turns out that there's a quite\nstrong association there,\none that would almost lead you to believe\nthat being bipolar can be beneficial\nin certain contexts, and yet,\non whole, having bipolar disorder\nis extremely detrimental and challenging\nto the person suffering from it.\nAnd it's something that\nwe want to keep in mind\nas we think about treatments\nand the underlying biology.\nNow I'd like to talk about\nsome of the treatments\nfor bipolar disorder.\nAnd in the discussion of those treatments,\nthere's an absolutely incredible history\nof the discovery of one\nparticular treatment\nthat still shows great\nsuccess in many patients,\nalthough some people\ncan't take it for reasons\nthat we'll talk about.\nAnd in the description of the discovery\nof this treatment for bipolar disorder,\nit also reveals to us that sometimes\ntreatments come to the\nprofession of medicine\nand through science in ways that precede\nthe discovery of the underlying biology.\nThat's right, every once in a while,\nsomeone will discover a\ntreatment for a disease\nwithout any understanding\nabout the underlying biological basis\nof that disease.\nAnd in fact, that is the\ncase for bipolar disorder\nand the treatment that we are referring to\nis lithium.\nLithium, as some of you know,\nis on the periodic table of elements.\nIt is indeed a naturally\noccurring substance.\nIt actually arrived on\nearth by way of star dust.\nYes, we are talking about\nstar dust on this podcast,\nbut if you'd like to learn more\nabout the origins of lithium\nand how lithium arrived here on earth\nfor its discovery and\napplications in psychiatry,\nthere's a beautiful talk\nthat exists on YouTube\nand we'll provide a link to this\nin the show note captions that describes\nthe history of lithium in terms\nof its interplanetary travels\nand arrival on earth.\nThis is a talk delivered by a physicist\nwho is expert in quantum mechanics\nand is expert in lithium.\nAnd it's a just wonderful\ntalk that I can refer you to,\nless on the biology in that talk,\nbut certainly a lot about\nlithium as an element.\nSo for those of you nerds like me,\nthat love to know how things\ncame to be here on the planet\nin one form or another,\nI'll encourage you to take\na brief listen to that talk.\nWe are going to discuss\nlithium in the context\nof its applications for\ntreatment of bipolar disorder.\nAnd the discovery of\nlithium as a treatment\nfor bipolar disorder is\ntruly a miraculous story\nthat I think everyone should know.\nThe key player in this\nstory is a physician\nby the last name Cade, he\nwas an Australian physician.\nAnd Cade has a very interesting\nstory in his own right.\nCade was an Australian psychiatrist\nor Australian psychiatrist\nwho also was a soldier.\nAnd during World War II,\nafter the fall of Singapore to Japan,\nhe became a prisoner of war\nand he was a prisoner of\nwar from 1942 until 1945.\nSo he had some time for observation\nand during his imprisonment,\nhe observed some of his fellow inmates\nis going through pretty wild vacillations\nin mood and energy,\nessentially going from manic episodes\nto depressed episodes, or\nfrom manic to normal episodes.\nAnd for one reason or another,\nwe don't know why because\nI couldn't find any report\nas to why he hypothesized this,\nbut he hypothesized that\nthere was some buildup\nof some chemical in these people's brains\nthat then they would urinate out.\nAnd that urinating out\nof whatever chemical\nwas in there would allow\nthem to be more relaxed\nand not manic.\nIn other words, Cade hypothesized\nthat there's a buildup of a chemical\nin certain people's brains\nthat makes them manic\nand they urinate that chemical out.\nSo eventually he got out of this prison,\nas we mentioned in 1945,\nand he started doing experiments\nin addition to seeing\npatients in his clinic.\nAnd what he did is he\nstarted to take urine\nfrom people who exhibited mania\nand urine from people who were not manic,\nand he took that urine\nand he would inject it\ninto guinea pigs as an experimental model.\nAnd his general observation was that\nthere was something in the urine\nthat was indeed making\nthe guinea pigs more manic\nif they were injected with\nurine from a manic patient.\nThe exact measures that he was\ntaking in these guinea pigs\nwasn't exactly clear.\nThis is at a time or an era in science\nwhen you could just sort of report things\na little bit more subjectively,\nalthough there were still\nnumbers and statistics,\nit was a little bit more\nof like case studies\nand descriptions, but it turns out\nthat even though that all\nseems a little bit loose,\nit led to some incredible and\nstill important discoveries\nfor psychiatric health.\nSo what he figured out was that the urine\nfrom manic patients\nseemed to be more toxic\nfor these guinea pigs.\nAnd he also knew that there\nare two toxic substances\nin urine, urea and uric acid.\nSo he was able to separate\nthe urea and uric acid\nfrom people with mania\nand patients that did not have mania.\nAnd he figured out that the\nurea was the same in both\nthese mentally ill, manic patients\nand the non manic patients.\nSo it did not seem that urea\nwas the compound that was\ncreating these manic episodes\nor related to manic episodes\nor held the toxicity\nso instead he focused on the uric acid.\nNow in order to put the\nuric acid into solution\nso that he could inject\nit into these guinea pigs,\nhe had to try a number\nof different compounds\nin order to dilute it.\nIt just so happens that,\nand you chemists will\nbe familiar with this,\nbut there's certain\nthings that just don't go\ninto solution easily.\nYou put the powder in a vial,\nyou add some water or a\nsaline or another solution,\nyou mix it up and the powder\nstays suspended in there,\nit doesn't actually ever\nbecome a clear liquid\nthat you can inject.\nSo in order to try injecting\ndifferent strengths\nof uric acid,\nhe ended up using lithium\nto assist in the dilution,\nand lithium worked.\nSo what he basically was doing,\nagain for you chemists,\nis he was taking uric acid,\nhe was adding lithium,\nand making a solution of lithium urate.\nthis is a lot of details,\nbut this is important\nbecause what he eventually found\nis that when he diluted the uric acid\nwith lithium and created lithium urate,\nlithium urate could actually\ncalm down these guinea\npigs that were injected\nwith the toxic urea.\nHe also found that lithium urate\nhad a generally calming\neffect on these guinea pigs.\nSo now we're really\noff in crazy territory,\nwe're talking about urine from patients\nthat's separating out urea and uric acid,\nwe're adding lithium to the uric acid,\nwe're injecting this into guinea pigs,\nthis is getting pretty\nwild and pretty weird,\nbut this is medicine,\nand from time to time,\nthis is medicine and science.\nCade was a good scientist in addition\nto being a good physician,\nand by good scientists,\nI mean that he did control experiments.\nHere he was injecting\nlithium urate into animals\nand seeing an effect,\nbut he knew that that\nsolution of lithium urate\ncontained not just the uric acid,\nbut it also contained lithium.\nAnd so he quite appropriately asked,\nmaybe the lithium alone is\nhaving this calming effect\non these guinea pigs.\nAnd indeed, that was the case.\nWhen he did the proper control experiment\nand injected only lithium\nsolution into these guinea pigs,\nthey calmed down.\nFrom there, he in sort\nof 1940 style medicine,\nthis would not happen now,\nhe very quickly moved\nfrom that animal model\ninto human patients and started\ninjecting human patients\nwith lithium or providing\nlithium orally to those patients.\nAnd lo and behold, found\nan absolutely profound\nand positive effect of lithium\nin reducing symptoms of mania.\nAnd as all good physician scientists do,\nhe wrote up his results.\nAnd he wrote it up in a paper entitled,\nLithium Salts in the Treatment\nof Psychotic Excitement.\nOkay, back then they didn't call it mania,\nthey called it psychotic excitement.\nThis is a paper that was\npublished September 3rd, 1949\nin the Medical Journal of Australia.\nWe will provide a link to this study,\nis now a classic study in\nthe field of psychiatry.\nIt's a really wonderful paper to read.\nAnd actually I encourage people,\neven if you're not a\nscientist or a clinician\nto just take a quick\nlook at the second page\nin this paper that we've\nmade available to you\nwhere he describes each of\nthe various case studies\nor the individuals that he looked at.\nI'm not going to read these in detail now,\n'cause it would take a\nlot of unnecessary time,\nbut things like case seven,\nMC, aged 40-years-old,\nsuffering from manic recurrent mania.\nIn this episode, he'd\nbeen excited, restless,\nand violent for over two months\nand was interfering so often\nthat had to be confined to a single room\nduring the day.\nSo this is very debilitating,\nwhat we now know to be bipolar depression.\nHe commenced taking\nlithium citrate, 20 grains,\nthat's a measure of the amount of lithium,\nthree times a day.\nIn four days, he was distinctly quieter\nand by February 13th, 1949,\nappeared practically normal.\nHe continued well and\non February 20th, 1949,\nthe dose of citrate was\nreduced to 10 grains,\net cetera, et cetera.\nHe left the hospital.\nThere are numerous descriptions\nof this sort within this paper,\nincluding some descriptions of patients\nthat did not see such success,\nand including some\ndescriptions of patients\nthat suffered from some\nnegative side effects.\nSo that's important to point out as well,\nbut it's an absolutely wonderful paper\nand it's an absolutely wonderful voyage\ninto the history of psychiatry\nright down to the discussion where\nin just three short paragraphs,\nCade really lays out the case for why\nlithium is such a important discovery\nin the treatment of what, at that time,\nthey were calling psychotic excitement\nand what we now know to be\nmanic bipolar depression.\nLithium, I should mention,\nhas a number of important features,\nbut it also a number of\nimportant side effects\nthat need to be considered.\nFirst of all, it does have\na certain toxicity and\nso levels of lithium\nin the blood need to be\nmonitored extremely carefully.\nSo it's not the sort of thing that people\ncan just take at a given dose\nand every patient responds the same,\nthere's a lot of oversight\nand a lot of blood tests\nthat have to be done,\nespecially in the first three\nmonths of lithium treatment.\nI should mention that lithium treatment\nis still used to some great\ndegree of success in many,\nnot all people suffering\nfrom bipolar depression,\nor bipolar disorder rather,\nbut there are a number of\nimportant things that happened\nbetween 1949 and present day\nthat prevented lithium\nfrom reaching patients\nthat really needed it.\nAnd that all can be summarized\nin two or three short sentences.\nBasically, by virtue of\nthe fact that lithium\nis a naturally occurring element,\nit could not be patented.\nAnd as a consequence of that,\nthere wasn't a lot of potential profit\nfor drug companies to produce lithium.\nIn fact, still to this\nday, it's very low cost,\nand still to this day, no\none really owns the patent\nfor lithium in its purest form.\nSo that made it unattractive.\nIt turns out that the\nFDA in the United States\ndidn't allow lithium to\nbe used as a treatment\nfor manic bipolar disorder until 1970.\nSo we're talking about a full 21 years\nfrom the publication of this paper by Cade\nin the Medical Journal of Australia\nshowing quite beautifully\nthe great potential in use of lithium\nfor quelling the symptoms\nof bipolar disorder\nuntil the first patients\nin the United States\nwere starting to access lithium regularly.\nAnd nowadays, of course,\nlithium is available,\nbut still not able to be patented\n'cause it's element number\nthree on the periodic table,\nit's naturally occurring.\nIt's not literally falling\ndown from the stars as stardust\nand going into pill form,\nbut rather it can be synthesized\nin laboratories, but it is available.\nIt does show not only great\npotential in many patients\nbut great application in many patients\ndespite its side effects.\nSo lithium really stands as\nthis kind of golden example\nof a treatment that works,\nat least in many individuals,\nprior to an understanding\nof the biological basis\nof the disease for which\nthat treatment is needed.\nNow with that said,\nscientists and clinicians\nhave been quite rigorous\nin trying to understand\nwhy and how lithium works\nin order to understand\nthe why and how of bipolar disorder.\nThis is the way that proper\nmedicine and science is done.\nEven if there's an excellent\ntreatment for something,\nit's important to understand\nwhy that treatment works\nbecause, first of all, not everyone\nresponds to that treatment.\nSecond of all, scientists\nand physicians understand\nthat just because we have\none treatment that works,\nif it has any side effects at all,\nthere is the possibility\nfor better treatments.\nSo it's not just about\ntrying to bypass a drug\nthat doesn't make much\nmoney for drug companies,\nI know a lot of people\nthink in those terms,\nthey think, oh, well,\nthere's this continued\nsearch for better treatments\nfor bipolar disorder\neven though lithium works\nbecause lithium doesn't\nallow drug companies\nto make much money.\nThat's not really the case.\nThe fact of the matter\nis is that the toxicity,\nsome of the other issues that\nare created with lithium,\nthe fact that people need\nthe ongoing blood testing, et cetera,\nreally stimulates the\nneed, really an urgent need\nfor new and better treatments\nfor bipolar disorder.\nAnd only by understanding\nhow lithium works\nat the cellular level, at\nthe neural circuit level,\net cetera, do we really stand to find\nthose new discoveries.\nIf you were to do a literature search on\nthe actions and mechanisms of lithium\nin terms of how it can calm people down\nand reduce their manic episodes,\nyou would find an\nenormous array of papers,\nliterally thousands of scientific studies\nin animals and in humans,\nwhich, for instance will tell\nyou that lithium treatment\nwill increase so-called BDNF,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor.\nBDNF is often talked about in the context\nof neuroplasticity,\nthe brain and nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience.\nAnd indeed it does seem\nthat ingesting lithium\nincreases BDNF.\nBDNF is what we call\npermissive for neuroplasticity.\nIt doesn't create specific\nchanges in the brain,\nmeaning it's not going to\nmake your memory better\nor your coordination better,\nor your emotional state better per se,\nwhat BDNF does is it permits the neurons,\nthe nerve cells and their\nconnections in the brain\nto be more likely to change\nif the proper environmental\nconditions are met.\nThat is BDNF creates a kind of\nbuoyancy to neuroplasticity.\nIt opens the gates to neuroplasticity.\nSo lithium does increase BDNF,\nwe'll talk about why that's\nimportant in the context\nof the neural circuits involved\nwith bipolar disorder in a few minutes.\nIt also seems to be a\npotent anti-inflammatory.\nNow, inflammation is one of those words\nthat's thrown around extensively nowadays,\nespecially on social media\nand especially as it relates\nto any health condition,\nit's like inflammation,\ninflammation, inflammation,\nalways seems to be discussed\nin the context of inflammation being bad.\nBut I do want to point\nout that inflammation\nis a natural adaptive\nresponse to physical injury\nto a cell or organ or tissue of any kind.\nInflammation is the basis by which\nadaptations occur to exercise.\nSo if, for instance,\nyou were to weight train and use a heavier\nthan normal weight kind,\ndo a set to failure or create\nsome little micro tears\nin the muscle that are healthy\nin the sense that they\nwould create adaptations\nand make that muscle stronger,\nmaybe even grow that muscle,\nthere's an inflammatory\nresponse associated with that\nthat is critical to the\npositive adaptation.\nSo inflammation isn't always bad,\nalthough excessive, or as we say,\nrunaway inflammation is bad.\nLithium seems to be able to\nsuppress inflammation and,\nimportantly, it can suppress inflammation\nin neural tissues and within\nthe brain in particular.\nThat is important.\nAnd we return to that\nand why it's important\nin a little bit.\nThe other thing about lithium\nis that lithium is neuroprotective,\nthat is it can prevent neurons from dying\nunder certain conditions.\nWhy would neurons die?\nWell, there are a lot of\nreasons why neurons can die.\nThere can be a physical\ninsult to the neurons.\nYou can get hit really\nhard in the head, a bullet,\nGod forbid, can enter the\nskull and kill neurons,\nthere are a lot of reasons\nwhy neurons can die.\nNeuroprotection is a\nsituation in which a neuron\nis given some sort of chemical\nor physical resiliency\nthat allows it to suffer an insult\nand yet bounce back.\nSo it's very similar to\nthe way that we think\nabout psychological resiliency,\nneuroprotection is an ability for neurons\nto be better able to handle stress\nof different kinds, in\nparticular, excitotoxicity.\nThere's a phenomenon in bipolar disorder\nand a lot of other psychiatric conditions\nin which hyperactivity\nof certain brain areas\nactually starts to kill off neurons.\nHyperactivity doesn't always do this,\nbut it turns out that if\ncertain brain circuits\nare too active for too long,\nsome of the chemicals\nassociated with neuroactivity,\nthings like calcium and neurotransmitters\nlike glutamate can actually\nkill the very neurons\nthat are active.\nSo it seems that lithium can prevent\nsome of that neurotoxicity.\nNow, this turns out to\nbe particularly important\nfor this discussion about bipolar disorder\nand the neural circuit\nbasis of bipolar disorder\nbecause if we are just\ntake a step back and ask,\nwhat's different in the brains of people\nwith bipolar disorder?\nThere are some very interesting answers\nthat start to emerge.\nThere are basically two\nmain neural circuits\nthat are present in normal individuals,\nI say normal, I say that respectfully\nto the people with bipolar disorder\nby referring to people who do not suffer\nfrom manic episodes or\nfrom manic depression.\nThere are circuits that are present\nin people with bipolar disorder\nand in people that do not suffer\nfrom bipolar disorder,\nboth of those circuits do the same thing\nin both sets of individuals,\nand yet in people with bipolar disorder,\nthere seems to be an atrophy or a removal\nof certain neural connections over time\nthat leads to a situation in which people\nwith bipolar disorder become very poor\nat registering their own internal state,\nin particular, their emotional states\nand their somatic states.\nWhat we're referring to here\nis something called interoception.\nI've talked about this a little bit\non the Huberman Lab Podcast before,\nbut there are two modes of perception.\nPerception, of course, is a attention\nto something that's\nhappening in our environment\nor to us on or within our body.\nExteroception is literally\nan attention to things\nthat are happening beyond\nthe confines of our skin.\nSo seeing that person's face over there,\nor seeing that color of leaf over there,\nor hearing a sound over to my left,\nthat is exteroception,\nperception of things\nbeyond the confines of one's skin.\nThen there's interoception\nwhich is perception of things\nthat are happening internally\nlike, how full does my gut feel?\nHow fast is my heart beating?\nSome people can measure\nthat quite accurately\njust by thinking about\nit, other people can't.\nHow happy am I, how sad\nam I, how energetic am I,\nhow lethargic am I, et cetera, et cetera.\nSo we are always existing in a balance\nbetween exteroception and interoception,\nbut as it turns out, people\nwith bipolar disorder\nover time, and especially into the second\nand third decade of\nhaving bipolar disorder\nseem to have progressively\ndiminished levels\nof interoception.\nAnd that very likely is important\nin their inability to\nregister, for instance,\nthat, wow, they are talking\nat an excessive rate\nor they haven't slept\nin 5 or even 10 days,\nor they haven't eaten in\na long period of time.\nThis atrophy of neural\ncircuits for interoception\nis starting to emerge\nas one of the defining\nneural circuit characteristics\nor underpinnings of bipolar.\nNow I bridge to this conversation\nabout neural circuits\nfrom the statement that\nlithium can protect\nagainst some of the neurotoxic effects\nof neural circuits being very active.\nNow this can get a little bit complicated,\nbut I promise I'm going to make it clear\nfor any of you that are\nwatching and or listening.\nThe reality is\nthat people with bipolar depression\nvery likely have a hyperactivity,\nthat is an increased level of activity\nin certain circuits within the brain\nearly in the expression of their disease.\nAnd that typically, as\nI mentioned earlier,\nsets in around the early\n20s, although sometimes\nthat can be even earlier,\nin the teens and so forth.\nBut that hyperactivity, we think,\nleads to a toxicity and excitotoxicity\nof certain elements of the neural circuits\nthat are responsible for interoception.\nIn other words,\nthe overuse of certain\ncircuits can lead to a\ndiminishing, an atrophy, or even a death\nof certain elements within those circuits\nand it appears that lithium,\nthrough its anti-inflammatory\nand neuroprotective effects\nand through its ability to increase BDNF,\nvery likely protects us against some\nof that atrophy of those\ncircuits for interoception.\nSo this isn't a case in which\npeople with bipolar have a neural circuit\nor lack a neural circuit\nand people without\nbipolar are the opposite.\nThis is a case in which\neveryone more or less\nstarts out the same,\nbut it seems that there's a hyperactivity\nof certain neural circuits in people\nwith bipolar disorder that over time\nactually causes those\ncircuits to diminish.\nNow, this is very important because some\nof the more recent longitudinal studies\ndoing brain imaging on people\nwith bipolar disorder and those without,\nand doing that over time in patients\nstarting as early as their teens,\nbut into their 20s and\n30s reveals just that,\nthat there can be hyperactivity\nof circuits early on,\nbut then hypo, reduced activity\nof those very same circuits\nat a time 5 or 10 years later.\nAgain, this speaks to\nthe complicated nature\nof bipolar disorder and\nthe complicated nature\nof psychiatry and linking\nspecific psychiatric disorders\nto neural circuits in general.\nBecause if you have a situation in which\nin one disease, let's just,\nhypothesize here for a second\nthat for instance, in certain\nforms of schizophrenia,\nthere's elevated dopamine\nand where we to just reduce\nthe amount of dopamine, that\nthey would receive relief\nfrom those schizophrenic symptoms,\nwell, that's all pretty\nstraightforward on the face of it,\nbut in this situation\nwith bipolar disorder,\nwhat we're talking about is hyperactivity,\ntoo much activity leading to hypoactivity\nthrough death of those very circuits.\nAnd so now you can\nespecially appreciate why\nwhen the patient shows\nup to the psychiatrist\nor when the psychiatrist\nshows up to the patient\nin the total course of their disease\nis going to be very important.\nAnd then layer on top of that\nthe complexity of the fact\nthat the very defining characteristic\nof bipolar disorder is that\nthere are oscillations in mood.\nSo now we need to think about treatments,\nnot just for the manic episodes,\nbut also treatments for\nthe depressive episodes.\nAnd that's, in fact,\nwhat psychiatrists do.\nTurns out that they apply\ndifferent treatments\nor combinations of treatments for patients\nthat are in manic episodes\nversus depressive episodes\nand they have to infer\nall that from discussions,\nagain, just exchange of words\ndepending on when that person\nwalked into their office,\nwhere they are in terms of manic episodes,\nno symptomology or\ndepressive symptomology,\nand whether or not they've\nhad that symptomology\nfor an extended period of time.\nAnd then just to make the\nsituation even more complicated,\nthe very circuits that\natrophy that start to wane\nand disappear in people\nwith bipolar disorder\nare the circuits for interoception,\nfor understanding of what's\ngoing on in one's own body.\nSo you can imagine if you\nsit down and ask somebody,\nwell, how long have, has it been\nsince you've slept, that\nperson may genuinely not know.\nOr if you ask the very depressed person,\nhow depressed are you?\nThat person may not be\nable to articulate that.\nSo fortunately there are solutions to this\nand the solution is that\nmore often than not,\nthe accurate understanding\nof whether or not someone\nhas bipolar depression or not,\nand what stage of the illness\nthey might be in or not\nis going to depend on the\nreports of people around them\nand not the patient themselves,\nhence the importance of\nhaving a rather detailed\nand admittedly a rather intense discussion\nabout the symptomology\nof bipolar disorder,\nso that you can have an understanding\nof the people around you\nand have an eye and an ear\nto whether or not those\npeople might be suffering\nfrom bipolar, and if so, at\nwhat stage of the disease\nthey might happen to be at.\nNow I'd like to talk a little bit more\nabout what is known\nabout the neural circuits\nthat lead to the manic states,\nas well as the depressive states,\nbut mainly the manic\nstates of bipolar disorder.\nWe already discussed the\nfact that interception,\nregistering of one's own internal emotions\nand bodily states is diminished in people\nwith bipolar disorder.\nBut we haven't really talked\nabout the neural circuits\nthat are responsible for\nthat lack of recognition.\nFor that reason, I'd like\nto point out a paper.\nThis is a fairly recent paper,\njust came out this year,\nbut it's an excellent one,\nLooking at the changes over\ntime in neural circuitry\nin people with high genetic\nrisk for bipolar disorder,\nand in particular in young people.\nAnd studies of this sort are rare,\nbut are exceedingly\nimportant because of the fact\nthat they track individuals over time.\nThe title of this paper is,\nLongitudinal Changes in\nStructural Connectivity\nin Young People at High Genetic\nRisk for Bipolar Disorder.\nWe will provide a link to this study\nin the show note captions.\nThere are a lot of data in this paper,\nin particular, neuroimaging data,\nand it's quite extensive\nin terms of analyzing\nthe so-called connectomics.\nYou've probably heard of genomics,\nwhich is the analysis of\ngenes and their display\nin different individuals or\ndifferent animals, et cetera.\nYou have proteomics,\nwhich is the display of,\nor the existence of different proteins.\nSo omics is a big thing now in science,\nyou kind of throw omics behind anything\nand it becomes its own Wikipedia page,\nwhich means it becomes its own thing,\nso to speak, I say that\nonly partially in jest.\nNonetheless, connectomics\nis the analysis of connections\nbetween different neurons\nand neural circuit elements.\nAnd what this paper really showed\nby analyzing the connectomics\nof neural circuits\nin the brains of many different people\nwith different categories\nof, and onset of,\nand severity of\nbipolar disorder,\nas well as controls in\ndifferent age groups, et cetera,\nis that people who are\nof particularly high risk\nfor having bipolar disorder\nor that have full blown bipolar disorder,\nhave deficits and actually reductions\nin the amount of connectivity between\nwhat are called the parietal brain regions\nand the limbic system.\nNow, the limbic system\nI've talked about before\nin this podcast, if you're\nnot familiar with it,\nI'll explain what it is in a moment,\nit's simply a collection\nof brain structures,\nnot one brain structure,\nbut a collection of brain structures\nthat generally are responsible\nfor shifting the overall\nstate that we're in\nfrom states of more relaxed and calm\nto states of more alert and focused.\nThe limbic system is intimately related\nto the so-called autonomic nervous system,\nwhich regulates our sleep wake cycles\nand a number of other things\nlike our digestion, et cetera,\nour level of hunger and on and on.\nSo the limbic system is really\nkind of like a volume control\nor as nerd scientists like to say,\na kind of gain control\non the overall level\nor amplitude of alertness or calmness.\nIn fact, if we're very, very calm,\nwe are asleep or even more\ncalm, we can be in a coma.\nIf we are very alert, we can be wide awake\nand ready to work and run, et cetera.\nOr if we are very, very, very alert\nby way of limbic autonomic interactions,\nwell, then we can be in anxiety.\nWe can be in full blown panic attack,\nor we can be in mania.\nWe can have so much energy\nthat we feel like we don't need to sleep.\nAnd in fact, disruptions in the circuitry\nreally seems to be what's going on\nin people who have bipolar disorder.\nNow, if disruptions in the circuitry\nare present in the limbic system,\nthat doesn't necessarily\nmean that the limbic system\nis at fault because the way\nthat neural circuits work\nis that different brain areas are talking\nto one another through\nelectrical-chemical signaling,\nand they're regulating one another.\nAnd what this paper really tells us\nis that there are elements\nwithin the parietal lobe,\nwhich is a kind of a section of the brain\nthat sits off to the side,\nit's not really off to the side,\nbut in neuroanatomical nomenclature,\nthe parietal lobe is connected\nin two ways, bidirectionally.\nSo parietal lobe is\nconnecting to limbic system\nand limbic system is\nconnecting to parietal lobe.\nAnd in people with bipolar disorder,\nit seems that the parietal lobe\nis able to exert less top down control,\nthat is less suppression\nof certain elements\nof the limbic system,\nwhich, at least right now,\nis leading researchers to hypothesize\nthat the limbic system is sort\nof revving at higher levels.\nIt's kind of like RPM in your cars\nor kind of redlining at\ntimes and for durations\nthat are inappropriate\nor at least abnormal.\nSo we have two major sets\nof neural circuit deficits\nor changes in people with bipolar.\nTheir lack of internal\nawareness is reduced,\nand that turns out to be,\nby way of neural structures,\nlike the insula which is a brain region\nthat is connected in a very direct way\nto our somatosensory cortex,\nso the part of our cortex that\nregisters how we feel,\nliterally, sense of\ntouch and internal state.\nSo those circuits, excuse me,\nfor those for those of you listening\nI just bumped the microphone, excuse me.\nThose circuits are disrupted\nin people with bipolar\nand the top down control,\nthat kind of accelerator and break\non our overall levels of\nenergy are also disrupted.\nNow that's all fine and good\nbecause, well, it's true,\nat least according to what the data\nat this point in time tell us,\nthere may be new discoveries to come,\nbut that all seems to be the case,\nbut it doesn't tell us how to modulate\nor change that circuitry.\nIt also doesn't tell us\nhow something like lithium\ncan actually benefit a\nlarge number of patients\nor how a good number\nof the other treatments\nfor bipolar disorder, which\nwe'll talk about going forward\ncan benefit patients with bipolar.\nSo it appears that lithium is exerting\nits positive effects on\nbipolar depression treatment,\nat least in part by preventing the loss\nof certain neural circuits,\nnamely the neural\ncircuits for interoception\nand the top down control\nover the limbic system.\nNow it turns out to be\nexamining lithium's effects\nat an even more reductionist level,\nwe can gain really important\ninsight into what's going on\nin bipolar depression and\nsome of the other treatments\nfor bipolar depression,\nincluding behavioral treatments,\nthings like transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation,\nand even some of the more natural\nor so-called nutraceutical treatments\nincluding things like high\ndose omega-3 supplementation,\nwhich we're going to\ntalk about extensively.\nNow, in order to\nunderstand what we're going\nto talk about next, it's important\nthat everybody understand a\nkey concept of neuroplasticity.\nAnd this is a key concept\nregardless of whether or not\none is talking about bipolar depression.\nIn fact, it's something I think everybody,\nevery citizen of earth should know about,\nand that's called homeostatic plasticity.\nHomeostatic plasticity\nis a particular form\nof neuroplasticity in\nwhich if a neural circuit\nis overactive for a period of time,\nthere are changes that\noccur at the cellular level\nthat lead to a balance or\na homeostatic regulation\nof that circuit so that\nit's no longer overactive.\nConversely, if a neural\ncircuit is underactive\nfor a period of time,\ncertain changes happen within\nthe cells of that circuit\nto ramp up their activity\nor make them more likely\nto be active.\nAnd whether or not a neural circuit\nand the neurons within\nit become more active\nor less active in the context\nof homeostatic plasticity\nlargely depends on one mechanism,\nand it's a beautiful\nmechanism that I'll make\nvery clear to you right now,\neven if you don't have\na background in biology.\nNeurons communicate with one another\nby releasing so-called neurotransmitters,\nwhich are just chemicals.\nThose neurotransmitters are vomited out,\nthey're not actually vomited,\nbut they're spit out into\nthe so-called synaptic cleft,\noften called the synapse.\nThe synapse is just a\nlittle gap between neurons.\nAnd when they are\nreleased into the synapse,\nthey don't just stay there,\nthey actually park or bind to receptors\non what's called the postsynaptic neuron.\nAnd depending on how many\nreceptors they bind to\nand how many receptors\nare available, et cetera,\nthey can have a greater or lesser effect\non the postsynaptic neuron.\nThis scenario of\nneurotransmitters being released\ninto synapses then binding to receptors\non postsynaptic neurons and influencing\nthe electrical excitability\nof those postsynaptic neurons\nsits central to not just the\ntreatment of bipolar disorder,\nbut to all treatments of\nall psychiatric conditions\nand indeed to things like\nneuropathic pain as well.\nFor example, the so-called SSRIs,\nProzac, Zoloft and others, et cetera,\nstands for selective\nserotonin re-uptake inhibitor.\nWhat does that mean?\nWell, serotonin is a neurotransmitter.\nIt's actually a\nneuromodulator that's released\ninto the synapse, and then the SSRI,\nthe selective serotonin\nre-uptake inhibitor\nallows more of that serotonin\nto sit within the synapse\nfor longer, it's a re-uptake inhibitor,\nit prevents re-uptake by\nthe presynaptic neuron.\nand that serotonin therefore can park in\nor dock in the receptors, as it's called,\nof the postsynaptic\nneuron in greater numbers,\nand have a greater impact\non that postsynaptic neuron.\nSo the drugs that are\nused to treat depression\nor other things of that\nsort, things like SSRIs,\nwork by changing the\navailability of neurotransmitter\nin the synapse.\nOther things like MAO inhibitors,\nMonoamine oxidase inhibitors,\nwork a different way.\nThey inhibit the enzyme.\nAnytime you hear ase in biology,\nit's very likely an enzyme\nwhich breaks things down.\nso MAO inhibitors prevent the\nbreakdown, not the re-uptake,\nbut the breakdown of neurotransmitter\nand therefore allow more neurotransmitter\nto be available in the synapse\nand influence the postsynaptic cell.\nHomeostatic plasticity is\na form of neuroplasticity\nin which overall circuits can\nbecome much more excitable\nor much less excitable by the addition\nof more receptors in\nthe postsynaptic neuron\nor by the removal of more receptors\nfrom the postsynaptic neuron.\nAnd the way this happens\nis just beautiful.\nIt was first discovered\nin the visual system\nand the person primarily responsible\nfor the discovery of\nhomeostatic plasticity,\nalthough there are several,\nis a woman by the name of Gina Turrigiano,\nshe's a professor at Brandeis University.\nAnd what the Turrigiano Laboratory showed\nwas that for instance, if we\nare in the dark for a long\nperiod of time, literally,\nand we're not seeing much\nfor a long period of time,\nthere's an increase in\nthe number of receptors\nin the postsynaptic neurons\nso that a smaller amount\nof light and excitability\nwithin the visual system can lead\nto greater amounts of\nactivity in the visual system.\nConversely, if there's an overactivity\nor an increase in that\nactivity in the visual system\nfor some period of time,\nthen a number of receptors\nin the postsynaptic neuron\nare removed from that\npostsynaptic neuron surface,\nmaking any neurotransmitter\nthat's available\nonly able to bind the\nreceptors that are left\nand have less of an\ninfluence on those cells.\nIn other words, keeping a circuit\nin so-called homeostatic balance\nin a particular range of excitability.\nNow, while that's a mouthful and an earful\nand a concept-full, I don't know\nif a concept-full is a\nword, but in any case,\nthat's a lot to think about,\nbut all you need to know\nis that if a neural circuit\nis very active for a period of time,\nin normal individuals,\nthere will be a reduction\nin the amount of activity\nby way of removing\nreceptors that bind neurotransmitter.\nWhereas, if a neural\ncircuit is very quiet,\nit's not activated for a period of time,\nmaybe your leg is in a cast for instance,\nand you're not activating\nyour quadricep and calves\nvery much, well when that cast comes off,\nsure, the muscle might be atrophied\nbut the nerves that connect to that muscle\nare actually in a position\nto influence that muscle\neven more once you start using\nthat muscle or those muscles,\nbecause whatever\nneurotransmitter is released\nnow has the opportunity\nto bind to more receptors,\nin that case in muscle,\nor in the case of brain circuits,\nin postsynaptic neurons.\nSo homeostatic plasticity\nis this beautiful,\nbalancing mechanism that makes\nsure that neural circuits\nare never too active nor\ntoo quiet for too long.\nAnd in a beautiful display of how\ntreatments can lead to a better\nunderstanding of biology,\nwhich can lead to the discovery\nof even better treatments, lithium and\nanother compound, which\nwe'll talk about, ketamine\nseem to exert their actions largely\nthrough effects on\nhomeostatic neuroplasticity.\nThere's a wonderful paper that describes\nall the nitty-gritty of this.\nCertainly most people\nlistening, I'm guessing,\nare not going to be\ninterested in all this detail,\nbut for those of you that you are\nand you want to delve deep into this,\nthis paper was published in\nNeuron Cell Press journal,\nexcellent journal,\nit's titled, Targeting\nHomeostatic Plasticity\nfor the Treatment of Mood Disorders.\nAnd there's one particular\nfigure in this paper\nthat I'll just describe to you\nin which measurements\nwere made from neurons\nand the number of\nreceptors in those neurons,\nit's done somewhat\nindirectly through a method\nthat's detailed and\nneuroscientists are familiar with.\nBasically what it measures is how excited\na given neuron is, electrically\nexcited a given neuron is\nto a given amount of neurotransmitter.\nSo that the amount of\nneurotransmitter that's vomited\nonto a neuron is\nessentially kept constant,\nand then the response\nof the postsynaptic neuron is measured.\nSo it can be of one\nlevel or higher or lower\ndepending on homeostatic plasticity.\nAnd what this paper shows\nand what's been shown\nover and over again, is that\nwhen neurons are exposed\nto lithium for a period of time,\nthere is a reduction in the excitability\nof the postsynaptic neuron,\nthat is neurons within the brain\nbecome less excitable over\ntime if lithium is present,\nwhereas ketamine, which is\nnow a common FDA-approved,\nat least in the US, it's\napproved for the treatment\nof major depression,\nketamine does the opposite.\nKetamine seems to increase\nthe number of receptors\nin the postsynaptic neuron\nand lead to greater levels\nof excitability and electrical activity\nwithin neural circuits\nto a given fixed amount\nof neurotransmitter.\nSo this is super interesting\nbecause what it means\nis that lithium is causing\ncircuits to be less active,\nketamine is causing\ncircuits to be more active.\nAnd we know from excellent\nclinical data now\nthat ketamine seems to be\na very effective treatment\nfor major depression, and for\nthe major depressive episodes\nof people that suffer\nfrom bipolar depression,\nthat includes these\nmajor depressive episodes\nof two weeks or longer of\nsuppressed mood, appetite,\nsleep issues, et cetera.\nNow, the key thing about ketamine\nthat's often not discussed\nis that while its effects\nare very potent, they are transient.\nSo one major drawback to\nketamine therapy for depression\nis that it has to be done repeatedly,\nand how repeatedly, or how often, rather,\ndepends, of course, on a discussion\nbetween the psychiatrist and the patient.\nThis is not something\nto cowboy on your own.\nI know that, and many of\nyou are probably familiar\nwith the fact that ketamine\nalso is abused recreationally.\nIt is a so-called NMDA,\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist,\nso it blocks the very\nreceptor that's responsible\nfor neuroplasticity for\nchanges in neural circuits.\nIt also changes excitability\nin neurons as I just described.\nSo ketamine is a very potent chemical\nthat has been shown over and over again\nand is now FDA approved for the treatment\nof major depression, but its\neffects seem to be transient.\nLithium, as I described earlier,\nseems to reduce the manic episodes\nor the intensity of manic\nepisodes in symptomology,\nin people with bipolar disorder,\nit's doing that through neuroprotection.\nSo protecting neural\ncircuits from dying away\nthat initially are overactive\nand that overactivity\ncausing excitotoxicity,\nblocks that excitotoxicity, we believe.\nAnd it seems to do that in part\nby diminishing the amount of\nactivity in those circuits.\nSo this is a beautiful mechanistic story,\nand it's the sort of story\nthat you'd love to have\nfor a great number of\npsychiatric illnesses.\nAnd fortunately we have\nfor bipolar disorder.\nOveractivity of a given circuit\neventually leads to\nneurotoxicity, excuse me,\nlithium is preventing that\nneurotoxicity by reducing\nthe number of receptors\nin certain elements\nwithin those circuits, so\ncalled homeostatic scaling,\nit's downregulating\nthe number of receptors\nleading to less\nexcitability and preventing,\nwe think, excitotoxicity.\nAnd in that sense, you can see exactly why\nit's important to get lithium treatment\nin there early for people\nwith bipolar disorder.\nKetamine as a treatment\nfor major depression\nseems to be effective but transient.\nAnd you can also see why\nit would be important,\nnot just to reduce the manic episodes\nfor people with bipolar disorder,\nbut to also treat the depressive episodes.\nSo this is a key feature of the treatment\nfor bipolar depression\nand for bipolar disorder.\nthere needs to be\ntreatment both of the mania\nand of the depressive\nepisodes if they're present.\nAnd fortunately, there are\nexcellent drugs to do that.\nAnd I should mention\nthat ketamine and lithium\nare just two of the drugs within the kit\nthat psychiatrists have access to.\nThere are many things, olanzapines\nand a number of different,\nincluding Clozapine.\nClozapine is an antipsychotic\nwhich is commonly prescribed to\nas a sedative in some\ncases that allows people\nin manic episodes to sleep.\nIt's classically described\nas so called dopamine\nreceptor 4 antagonist,\nalthough it does other things as well.\nClozapine has a number\nof side effect features\nrelated to white blood cell\nand things of that sort that\nrequire careful monitoring.\nSo there are an enormous number now,\nliterally dozens and\ndozens of different drugs,\neach designed to target\neither the manic phase,\nthe depressive phase, or\nsome what we call acute\nsort of early phases\nversus ongoing treatments.\nThis is a vast galaxy of drug treatments\nthat really should be navigated,\nI should say, absolutely\nshould be navigated\nby a board certified psychiatrist.\nAnd of course in close discussion\nwith both the person suffering\nfrom bipolar disorder,\nbut also ideally the family members\nof the person suffering\nfrom bipolar disorder.\nBut I think, at least up until now,\nwe've focused on the two major pathways\nfor treatment, lithium and ketamine.\nAnd we've talked about why\nlithium and ketamine work,\nthat they're working on opposite ends\nof this homeostatic scaling.\nWe talked a bit about the\ncircuits that are involved\nin generating what we think\nare the manic symptomology\nand the lack of interception.\nWhy people can just\npersist in staying awake,\nawake, awake, not eating, et cetera.\nNow you have in mind how\nall that is put together.\nAnd I think you have in mind,\nsome of the well-demonstrated treatments\nfor the different component\nparts of bipolar disorder,\nwhich now I'm hoping\nyou're also well versed in\nbased on our early, early discussion\nof what constitutes\nbipolar 1 and bipolar 2.\nNow I would like to also talk about\nsome of the not so typical therapeutics\nfor bipolar disorder and\nalso point to the things\nthat have been tried and failed\nfor successful treatment\nof bipolar disorder,\nbecause some of those things\nare often talked about and suggested,\nespecially in online communities,\nand while it's not clear that any of them\nare particularly hazardous on their own,\nalthough some of them\ndo carry some hazards,\nI do think it's important\nbecause of the critical\ntime sensitive nature of bipolar disorder\nand the urgency of\ngetting treatments early\nto try and prevent some\nof the longer lasting\nneural circuit changes\nthat if people can avoid\nsome of the less effective or demonstrated\nto be ineffective treatments,\nthat they stand to combat bipolar disorder\nmuch more successfully.\nFirst of all, a key point\nabout drug therapies\nversus non-drug therapies\nor talk therapies,\nwithout question, drug therapies\nare going to be most effective\nwhen done also with talk therapies.\nAnd we'll talk about which talk therapies\nhave been demonstrated\nto be most effective.\nThere is some argument about\nwhat I'm about to say next,\nbut in general, most\npsychiatrists will tell you,\nor certainly the ones I've\nspoken to have told me,\nthat talk therapy on its own\nis rarely, if ever effective\nfor bipolar depression\nand bipolar disorder, whether\nor not it's BP-I or BP-II.\nThat's just the reality of it.\nContrast that with our discussion\nabout obsessive-compulsive disorder,\nwhich we talked about a few episodes ago,\nif you haven't seen that episode,\nWe have an in-depth episode all about OCD\nand obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nThere it seems that drug\ntherapies and talk therapies\ncan be done independently\nor in combination.\nAs expected, combined\ndrug and talk therapies\nare more effective there\nthan either one alone,\nbut there are pretty impressive effects\nof talk therapy alone provided\nthat they're initiated at the right time,\nand it's the right form of talk therapy.\nThat's OCD, but in terms\nof bipolar disorder,\nit really seems that the\ndrug therapies are necessary,\nat least in most all cases.\nThat said, talk therapies\nare terrific augment\nor support for those drug therapies\nand sometimes can allow people\nto take lower doses of\nthose drug therapies,\nwhich turns out to be important\nbecause of the side\neffect profiles of a lot\nof drug therapies and\nsometimes the cost as well.\nI guess we can think of cost\njust as another side effect really.\nThere are both established\nand more novel forms\nof talk therapy being used, again,\nin concert with drug treatments\nfor bipolar disorder.\nCognitive behavioral therapy is the one\nthat seems to be best,\nat least by way of the\nstatistics and papers that exist.\nIt's also the one that's\nbeen explored the most.\nSo one of the reasons\nwhy it's often considered\nthe most popular or effective\nis 'cause it's also been around longer\nand it's been explored the most.\nCognitive behavioral therapy in general\nis a progressive exposure of the patient\nin a very controlled way,\nin a clinical setting,\nto some of the triggers or the conditions\nthat would exacerbate bipolar disorder.\nNow, earlier I said borderline\npersonality disorder\nhas all these triggers\nand triggered elements\nfrom the external environment,\nwhereas bipolar disorder does not.\nAnd that's still true, but\nit is the case that somebody with bipolar\ncan have worse symptoms if life conditions\nget worse or more stressful.\nSo cognitive behavioral therapy,\nI mean the discussion about\nand sometimes the direct exposure to\nanxiety provoking elements of life\ncan be very helpful for\nadjusting the responses\nto those otherwise triggering events\nand sometimes making the drug treatments\nmore effective even at lower doses.\nThere are also forms of therapy\nincluding family-focused therapy,\nwhich is especially important in terms\nof bipolar disorder because\nfamily members, provided\nthat they are not themselves\nin a manic episode due to the\nclose heritability of bipolar disorder,\nbut family members can\noften be excellent windows\ninto whether or not somebody\nis doing well or poorly,\nor is veering toward or is emerging from\na manic or depressive episode\nbecause they understand that person,\nthey have a lot of data,\nit could be purely subjective data,\nbut they have a lot of\nexposure to how long\nor well somebody's been\nsleeping or eating, et cetera.\nSo family-focused therapy\ninvolves other members\nof the person suffering from\nbipolar disorder's family,\nas well as conversations\nabout family members\nin a way that helps patients\nwith bipolar disorder navigate,\nnot just through manic episodes\nand depressive episodes,\nbut start to learn to predict\nwhat are the conditions\npsychological, physical, and otherwise\nthat can trigger bipolar episodes.\nAnd then there's a category of therapy\ncalled interpersonal and\nsocial rhythm therapy.\nThis is deserving of its\nown entire episode really.\nInterpersonal and social rhythm therapy,\nit's sort of an expansion\non family-focused therapy,\nalthough it's distinct\nin certain ways as well,\nand really focuses on how\npeople are relating to others\nin their life, and in the workplace,\nand in the school environment,\nand also within the family, et cetera.\nAnd I should say that a overall theme\nthat's emerging in\npsychiatry and psychology\nis to start wherever\npossible to incorporate\nmore of the social aspects\nand the interpersonal aspects.\nIn other words, not just talking to\nand examining a patient\nas one biological system,\none nervous system, one set\nof chemicals, and one life,\nbut rather a set of\nchemicals, neural circuits,\nand a life that's\nembedded in the chemicals\nand neural circuits and\nlives of other people.\nJust by way of example, you can imagine\nthat if somebody is in a\nvery healthy relationship\nor a very abusive relationship,\nthat that's going to strongly impact\nthe outcomes of manic episodes.\nYou can imagine that if\nthe financial situation\nis one in which people can\nrecover from manic episodes,\nI didn't mention this\nearlier, but I should have,\nforgive me, that oftentimes people\nwho are in a manic episode will go out\nand spend immense amounts of money\nthat they simply cannot afford to lose.\nAnd then the depressive\nepisodes that, in many cases,\nfollow are made far worse\nby the financial anxiety\nand the financial stress that results\nfrom those manic episodes\nof spending, et cetera.\nAnd then of course, this carries over\nto sexual promiscuity where\npeople might be dealing\nwith unwanted pregnancy or STIs, or\nvery fractured interpersonal dynamics\nwith existing or new relationships.\nI mean, you can imagine\nhow these manic episodes,\nas well as the depressive episodes\ncan really wick out into an\nenormous amount of destruction,\nwhich brings us back\nto the initial criteria\nof BP-1 and BP-2 is that\nthese manic episodes\nare not a good thing.\nThese depressive episodes\nare not a good thing.\nThey create this sense of euphoria\nin the person experiencing mania,\nor they create this sense\nthat anything is possible.\nBut at the end of the day,\nand actually every day,\nthese episodes are quite maladaptive.\nThey really destroy people's lives.\nAnd it's not just the life of the person\nthat's suffering from bipolar disorder.\nAnd so hence cognitive behavioral therapy,\nfamily-focused therapy and interpersonal\nand social rhythm\ntherapies are the primary\nthree talk therapies that\nare most often combined\nwith drug therapies in order to try\nand really reduce the harm.\nIt's really all about harm reduction\nfrom manic episodes and\ndepressive episodes.\nOne very exciting and emerging treatment\nthat does show great promise,\nand in some cases, great outcomes,\nfor bipolar disorder is, believe it or not\nelectric shock therapy.\nElectric shock therapy may sound barbaric,\nand in fact, it tends to look barbaric,\nalthough this is done in\nthe controlled setting\nof a hospital.\nIf any of you have seen One\nFlew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\nthe final scene or near\nfinal scene in that movie\nwas Jack Nicholson with\nthe sort of bite protector\nin his mouth and getting\nelectric shock therapy,\nand it's as the name suggests,\nit's a kind of inducing\na global seizure, either low\nlevel or grand mal type seizure\nin the patient's brain and nervous system.\nYou might ask, well, why\nwould one want to do that?\nWell, it turns out that\nthis is a well-established,\nand in many cases, very\neffective treatment\nfor major depression.\nElectric shock therapy is generally used\nfor treatment-resistant depression.\nSo these are people that\nhave no positive response\nor ongoing positive\nresponse to drug therapies\nor other therapies.\nElectric shock therapy is thought to work\nprimarily by stimulating the massive kind\nof indiscriminate release of things\nlike serotonin, dopamine, acetylcholine,\na huge variety of neuromodulators,\nas well as things like BDNF,\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor\nwhich then allows\nneuroplasticity to take place.\nAgain, BDNF being permissive\nfor neuroplasticity.\nThe problem with ECT is\nthat it's really only useful\nfor treatment-resistant depression,\nit doesn't actually\ntarget the manic aspects\nof bipolar depression\nand bipolar disorder,\nbut nonetheless, is used when\ndrug treatments don't work.\nSome of the negatives of\nelectric shock therapy\nor electric convulsive therapy, ECT,\nis the proper acronym\nand way it's described\nis that it's quite invasive, right?\nThis is something that you\nneed to go to the hospital for\nand oftentimes there's some\ninpatient care required\nafter the electric convulsive therapy.\nIt's a fairly high cost,\nespecially for those that\ndon't have insurance.\nAnd of course it requires anesthesia.\nFor most people, that's\nnot going to be a problem,\nbut for many people\nthat could be a problem.\nAnd there's often some\nassociated memory loss.\nAnd so the memory loss,\nthe invasive nature of ECT\nand the cost oftentimes rule\nout ECT for most patients,\nand that's why it's sort of a late stage\nor kind of last resort type thing\nfor treatment-resistant depression.\nNowadays ketamine type\ntherapy is done repeatedly\nor other treatments, for instance,\ntranscranial magnetic stimulation\nwhich is basically non-invasive,\nit's a coil that's placed on the outside\nof the skull, excuse me.\nAnd we can more accurately refer to it\nas repetitive or rTMS,\nrepetitive transcranial\nmagnetic stimulation.\nTranscranial magnetic\nstimulation is a tool\nthat allows researchers and clinicians\nto reduce the amount of activity\nin specific neural circuits.\nSo they can actually\ntarget the magnetic field\nto particular neural\ncircuits to reduce activity\nin those neural circuits.\nAgain, it's minimally invasive.\nIt has been shown to be effective\nin both increasing\nneuroplasticity in positive ways,\nas well as reducing depressive episodes\nand in a few instances in reducing\nthe amplitude or the\nintensity of manic episodes\nin people with bipolar disorder.\nThe problem is it's still\na very early technique.\nThere aren't a lot of\nclinics and labs doing it.\nI'm starting to see more advertisements,\nliterally commercial clinics\nthat are advertising rTMS or TMS.\nI encourage you to approach\nthose clinics with caution.\nI'm of the mind that if those clinics\nare not either closely\nor maybe even distantly\nassociated with a research institution\nthat's really up on the latest of rTMS,\nyou'd be wise to at\nleast do your research,\nand explore, talk to other patients\nwho've done these treatments,\nbut certainly in university hospitals\nand in clinical settings\nand research settings,\nrTMS is being used as\na way to, for instance,\nreduce the activity of\ncertain limbic circuitries\nso that people are just overall\nless excitable and manic\nor to activate because it can also be used\nfor activation now of\ncertain neural circuits.\nActivate, for instance,\nthe parietal inputs,\nthe top down control\nover the limbic system.\nThis is all happening right now.\nSo we have ECT, repetitive TMS or rTMS,\nand then as I mentioned\nearlier, ketamine therapies,\nmost of those are targeted\ntoward the depressive aspects\nof manic depression.\nSo for people with bipolar disorder\nthat doesn't include depression,\nthose are going to be less effective,\nbut overall, it's going\nto be the talk therapies\nof the sort that we discussed\nearlier, or a moment ago.\nPlus drug treatments,\nalmost always lithium will be explored,\nplus some treatments for\nthe depressive episodes\nin particular if those\ndepressive episodes are present.\nNowadays, there's a lot of\nexcitement about psilocybin\nwhich is a psychedelic.\nIn the US, psilocybin is still illegal.\nIt is not legal, meaning you\ncan get in a lot of trouble\nfor possessing it, certainly\nfor selling it, et cetera.\nBut psilocybin is being explored\nas a clinical therapy in\ncertain laboratory settings\nin particular, at Johns\nHopkins School of Medicine.\nIt's being explored in human patients\nfor the treatment of major depression,\nfor OCD I believe as well,\nbut certainly for major depression\nand for eating disorders.\nAnd it seems from the\ninitial wave of publications\nfrom that work done by the\nincredible Matthew Johnson\nor Dr. Matthew Johnson, who was a guest\non this podcast before,\nhe's also been on the Tim Ferris Podcast,\nhe's been on the Lex Fridman Podcast.\nDr. Matthew Johnson came on this podcast,\nhe's talked about some of the work\nwith psilocybin for the\ntreatment of depression.\nVery impressive results there.\nAnd as you can imagine,\nvery impressive results\nfor the major depressive\nepisodes for bipolar.\nHowever, at least to my knowledge,\nagain, to my knowledge,\nthere have not been any\ncontrolled clinical trials\nexploring psilocybin\nfor the mania associated\nwith bipolar disorder.\nIf someone out there is aware\nof those clinical trials,\nplease let me know.\nI'll do an update in a future podcast,\nbut right now, no knowledge from me\nabout psilocybin clinical trials\nfor the manic component\nof bipolar disorder.\nA number of people are\nprobably also going to wonder\nabout whether or not cannabis\nor medical marijuana is\nuseful for bipolar disorder.\nTo address this, I looked\nto some previous lectures\nand some clinicians at\nStanford Psychiatry.\nThis question was asked of\nthem, and as it turns out,\ncannabis does not seem to be effective\nfor the treatment of the manic phases\nof bipolar disorder or for the treatment\nof the major depressive component.\nThe only treatment perhaps,\nor I should say the only situation perhaps\nin which it might be useful,\nand this is what was relayed to me,\nis that it may help with\nsleep in certain people\nthat are having trouble with insomnia,\nthough nowadays, it's far\nmore common for people\nin manic episodes to be prescribed things\nlike Trazodone or other\nbenzos, benzodiazepines\nin order to try and get sleep\nwithin the manic episodes.\nAnd benzodiazepines and\nTrazodone, et cetera,\nwork largely through the\nso-called GABA system.\nThis is a neurotransmitter\nthat causes reductions in\nexcitability of neurons,\nhence why it's being used\nto try and calm people down\nand allow them to sleep\nduring their manic episodes.\nSo not a lot, or essentially no data,\nsupporting the use of\ncannabis for the treatment\nof bipolar disorder, per se,\nnor data supporting the use of psilocybin\nfor the treatment of\nbipolar disorder per se.\nBut I realize, as I say that,\nthat there are going to\nbe a number of people\nthat may have had positive\nor negative experiences\nwith cannabis or psilocybin\nas they relate to bipolar disorder.\nSo please, if you're\nwilling or comfortable,\nput that, if you're comfortable,\ninto the comment section on YouTube.\nAnd of course, if you\nare aware of any studies\non cannabis or psilocybin\nshowing positive outcomes\nfor the treatment bipolar\ndisorder, please provide links\nor PubMed ideas to those, I'd\nlove to peruse those studies.\nThere are two naturopathic,\nor I should say,\nnutrition, supplement-based\napproaches to bipolar disorder.\nThey get talked about a\nlot, and one of them shows\nsome interesting promise,\nor effectiveness even,\nin a limited context.\nBefore marching into this description\nof these two compounds, in\nfact before even mentioning\nthese two compounds,\nI do want to emphasize\nwhat's been said and written\nabout over and over again\nand what was relayed to me\nfrom expert psychiatrists.\nIt is not wise to rely\npurely on talk therapy\nor on natural approaches to the treatment\nof bipolar disorder given\nthe intensity of the disorder\nand the high propensity for suicide risk\nin people with bipolar disorder,\nit is a chemical and\nneural circuit disruption,\nand it needs to be dealt with head on\nthrough the appropriate chemistry\nand prescription drug approaches\nfrom a board-certified psychiatrist.\nI don't say this to protect me,\nI say this truly to protect\nthose who either suffer from\nor think they may suffer\nfrom bipolar disorder\nor if you know someone\nwho you think might suffer\nfrom a bipolar disorder.\nNow, all that is not to say\nthat there aren't useful\nlifestyle interventions\nthat can support people\nwith bipolar disorder.\nSo I just briefly want to mention those.\nAnd again, I'm lifting the\nstatements I'm about to make\nfrom some excellent online lectures\nfrom psychiatrists at\nStanford and elsewhere,\nwhich essentially say that,\nof course, of course, of course,\ngetting better sleep,\ngetting adequate exercise,\ngetting proper nutrition, having quality,\nhealthy, social interactions,\neven getting regular sunlight in the day\nand avoiding bright light at night,\nall of those things are\ngoing to braid together\nto support the nervous\nsystem and the psyche\nof somebody with bipolar disorder,\nbut they braid together\nto support the psyche\nand the neurochemistry\nand the neural circuits\nof anybody and everybody.\nSo they have generally a modulatory effect\nthat is they're indirectly shifting\nthe likelihood that somebody\nmight have an episode,\nor the intensity of an episode,\nin particular, the depressive episodes.\nYou can imagine how someone who's heading\ninto a depressive episode,\nmaybe they're on a lower\namount of medication\nor they haven't yet medicated\nfor the depressive episode of bipolar.\nAnd now they're making sure\nor their family is making sure\nthat they're getting exercise, sunshine,\neating correctly, social\nengagement, et cetera.\nOf course it makes perfect sense\nwhy they would have\nperhaps a shallower drop\ninto depression or maybe an offset\nof depressive episode.\nThat said, most all, if not all people\nwith bipolar disorder are likely to need\nsome sort of drug therapy intervention\nin order to help them.\nSo lifestyle factors are always important\nin all individuals,\nthose suffering from\npsychiatric conditions or not.\nBut in some conditions\nof the mind and body,\nthose lifestyle interventions\ncan have a greater effect\nin offsetting symptoms,\nwhereas in bipolar disorder,\nI think it's naive, and\nin fact, wrong to say\nthat lifestyle interventions alone\nare going to prevent,\nespecially the extreme forms\nof mania and depression.\nAgain, bipolar disorder being so serious\nand carrying such high suicide risk,\nwe just have to point\nthis out again and again.\nNow with that said,\nthere are two substances\ngenerally found as supplements,\nalthough there are other\nsources of them as well,\nincluding within nutritional sources\nthat have been shown, at\nleast in some studies,\nto be pretty effective\nin adjusting the symptoms\nof bipolar disorder, and\nthose two things are inositol\nand omega-3 fatty acids.\nNow inositol is a compound\nthat is taken for a variety of reasons.\nIt's something we've talked\nabout on the podcast before.\nI personally take inositol not because\nI have bipolar disorder,\nin fact I am quite lucky\nthat I don't have bipolar disorder,\nbut I take inositol, a 900\nmilligrams of myo-inositol\nevery third night or so in\norder to improve my sleep.\nIt's something that I've\nadded to my sleep stack.\nIt's something that I\nfound greatly enhances\nthe depth and quality of my sleep.\nAnd if I wake up in\nthe middle of the night\nto use the bathroom, et cetera,\nit's greatly enhanced my\nability to fall back asleep\nwhen I want to go back to sleep.\nIt also seems to have a fairly potent\nanti-anxiety effect during the day.\nAnd as I discussed in our episode\nabout obsessive-compulsive disorder,\ninositol has been used at high dosages,\nagain, I should say\nmyo-inositol has been used\nat high dosages, at levels\nof even 10, 18 grams,\nthose are massive dosages by the way,\nto deal with certain symptoms\nof OCD to limited success.\nAnd I should mention that\nhigh dosages of 10 or 18 grams\nof inositol can cause a lot\nof gastric discomfort, et cetera.\nIf you want to learn more about inositol\nand its various uses, I encourage\nyou to go to examine.com\nwhere there's the so-called\nHuman Effect Matrix,\nand that Human Effects\nMatrix will describe the many\nplaces in which myo-inositol\nand other forms of inositol\nhave been show shown to be effective\nin, for instance, reducing anxiety,\nenhancing sleep and on and on.\nMyo-inositol is important\nbecause myo-inositol,\nand we can just say inositol,\nis related to so-called\nsecond messenger pathways.\nI don't want to get too deep\ninto second messenger pathways,\nbut when certain substances\nbind, like neurotransmitters\nto a receptor on a cell surface,\noftentimes those receptors\nthemselves will open\nand allow the passage of ions\nand other things into a cell.\nOftentimes they will engage\nwhat are called second messenger systems\nthat is they will trigger\nmechanisms within the cell\nto then go do other things.\nThis is probably something\nwe should get into\nin real detail in a future episode\nfor those of you that\nreally want to nerd out\non cell-cell signaling, which\nis a favorite topic of mine.\nIn any case, inositol is related\nto a number of so-called\nsecond messenger systems,\nthis handoff, or this kind of stimulating\nof changes within a cell\nthat can inspire changes\nin what's called membrane fluidity,\ncan actually make the membranes of cells,\nthe outside fence around a cell,\nwhich is made up of fatty stuff,\nit can change the fluidity,\nmeaning how readily things can float\naround in the membrane.\nYou know, we think of cells as very rigid,\nlike there's a cell, there's a neuron,\nor there's a immune cell,\nbut actually those cells\nhave a fatty outside,\nin particular neurons\nhave a fatty outside.\nIt's a thin fatty outside,\nit's called the cell membrane,\nand things are floating\naround in that cell membrane,\nbut it's kind of like jello\nthat hasn't quite fixed.\nAnd so things like receptors\nmoving into the synapse\nor moving out the synapse\nfor homeostatic plasticity,\nthings like the ability for certain genes\nto be turned on in a\ncell or not turned on,\ncan depend a lot on\nthings that are happening\nin that cell membrane and how readily\nthings move around in the cell membrane.\nOne way to think about this whole picture\nof membrane fluidity is that just imagine\nthat everyone of your\ncells has this layer,\nit's kind of a gelatinous-like layer\nand there are lots of little rafts\nfloating around in there, but those rafts\nare able to move more quickly\nfrom one place to\nanother, or get more stuck\nat one place or another,\ndepending on how set\nthat jello is.\nInositol\nand lithium,\nand as we'll talk about\nnext, omega-3 fatty acids\nseem to change the fluidity\nof those membranes,\nin other words, they\nallow things to move in\nand out of those membranes\nmore readily or not.\nAnd this is no surprise given that\nthose membranes are\nmade out of fatty stuff.\nIn particular, the membranes of neurons\nare what called a lipid bilayer,\nit's two layers of fat,\nbi means two, lipid, fat.\nAnd omega-3 fatty acids\nof the sort that are found\nin certain fish, and that\nfatty fish in particular,\nand that are found in fish oil\nand cod liver oil, et cetera.\nOmega-3 fatty acids, when we ingest them\nare used for a lot of different things,\nbut they can be readily\nincorporated into pathways\nor directly incorporated\ninto cell membranes,\nchanging the way those cell membranes work\nand if those cell membranes\nare the cell membranes\nof neurons, changing the\nway that neurons work.\nSo the ability for fish oil,\nand in particular, the\nomega-3 fatty acids,\nwhich come in varieties like EPA and DHA,\nwe'll talk about that in a moment,\nhave been explored at\nrelatively high dosages\nfor their ability to\noffset some of the effects\nof mania and to offset the effects\nof depressive episodes\nin bipolar disorder.\nAnd actually, the data there\nare pretty impressive, although,\nalthough they are varied,\nmeaning you will find several studies,\nand I'll mention a few,\nthat found no effect\nof omega-3 supplementation\nthrough fish oil,\nusually it's capsuled fish oil,\nalthough fish oil can\nalso be taken, excuse me,\nin liquid form.\nOftentimes taking in liquid form\nis the more cost efficient way to do it.\nTaking in capsule form is the\nmore palatable way to do it,\nbecause fish oil for a lot\nof people doesn't taste good.\nBut nonetheless,\nthere are several studies that have shown\nthat supplementing with fish\noil or omega-3 fatty acids\nat levels of, for instance,\nfour grams per day\nfor a period of time,\nthis is a study that we\nwill link in the show notes,\nThis is Murphy at al. 2012.\nThis is a fatty acid\nsupplementation of 70% EPA to DHA\nactually worsen symptoms of mania\nover a period of about 16 weeks,\nwhich on the face of it\nmakes it seem like, okay,\nomega-3 fatty acid supplementation,\nvery likely to not be\ngood for bipolar disorder.\nAnd yet that was the manic phase.\nWhen one looks at some\nof the other studies\nof omega-3 fatty acid supplementation,\nthere is, for instance, a\nstudy published in 1999,\nthis is a much higher\ndosage supplementation\nwith omega-3 fatty acid,\nthis is a 9.6 grams of fish\noil per day for four months.\nAnd then actually greatly reduced symptoms\nof bipolar depression\ncompared to the control\ngroup which received olive oil,\nolive oil is a different form\nof fat, monounsaturated fat\nbut doesn't contain as much\nof the omega-3 fatty acids and so forth.\nSo 9.6 grams of fish oil\nper day over four months\nis a lot of fish oil\nto be ingesting on a given day.\nThis was a double blind study.\nThis was only carried out, I\nshould mention, in 30 subjects,\nbut it was males and females.\nAnd the age range was pretty broad,\nanywhere from 18 all the\nway up to 64 years of age,\nwhich is important given\nthe sort of longitudinal\nor changes over time,\nthat one sees in bipolar disorder.\nHere's the major takeaway,\nsupplementing with high dose omega-3s\ndoes seem to be beneficial\nfor a good number of people\nwith bipolar disorder.\nHowever, again, I want\nto highlight, however,\nit should not be viewed as\nthe only treatment approach\nfor bipolar disorder.\nThis goes back to what I was saying before\nabout the essential\nneed, in most every case,\nfor high potency\nprescription drug treatments\nprescribed by board\ncertified psychiatrists\nfor bipolar disorder.\nHowever, omega-3 supplementation\ndoes seem to improve\nor reduce the depressive symptoms\nin the major depressive\nepisodes of bipolar.\nAnd there are a couple studies,\nand we'll link to these\nin the show notes as well,\nthat show that it may even improve\nsome of the manic episodes as well,\nmeaning it reduces some\nof the manic symptoms.\nNow I say all this from\na place of great caution,\nbecause I know, especially\nfor listeners of this podcast,\nthere's a lot of interest\nin the behavioral tools,\nthe supplement-based tools,\nthe nutrition tools that can\nsupport bipolar disorder,\nbut I don't think I can\noveremphasize enough\nthat especially for bipolar disorder\nand the great risk of\nsuicide and suffering\nand inappropriate spending,\nor I should say maladaptive\nspending and impulsivity\nthat's associated with bipolar disorder,\nthat it's hard to imagine a scenario\nin which just talk therapy and fish oil\nand lifestyle interventions\nare going to completely\nsuppress or treat bipolar disorder.\nPeople with bipolar disorder\nreally need to consider\nthe full picture of treatments,\nthe drug treatments,\nthe\ntalk therapy treatments,\nand lifestyle treatments,\nand nutraceutical, or we can say\nsupplement-based treatments\nsuch as omega-3 supplementation\nas a full and necessary picture\nfor dealing with their illness.\nI'd be remiss, however,\nif I didn't emphasize that\nthe omega-3 fatty acid\nsupplementation\nis very interesting, not just in terms of\nthe subjective effects,\npeople saying they feel less depressed\nor able to sleep better, or\nmaybe even some reduction\nin manic symptoms,\nthere's actually been some\nreally good brain imaging\nto try and understand how\nomega-3 fatty acid treatments\nare actually changing the brains\nand neural circuits of\npeople with bipolar.\nAnd I will put a reference to this.\nThis is a paper that was published\nin the American Journal Psychiatry.\nIt's entitled, Omega-3\nFatty Acid Treatment\nand T2 Whole Brain Relaxation\nTimes in Bipolar Disorder.\nI don't have the opportunity\nto go into a lot of detail\nright now about what T2 whole\nbrain relaxation times are,\nbut basically when people go into a MRI\nor f, functional MRI scanner,\nexcuse me,\nmagnetic resonance imaging scanner,\nwhat they're getting essentially is pulses\nof magnetic fields and the\nway that brain structures\nand neural activity can be evaluated\nhas a lot to do with\nthe sort of spinning, or not sort of,\nit has to do with the spinning\nand the relaxation times\nof different elements,\nliterally the protons and\nelectrons within the neurons,\nso it gets really detailed there,\nand the relaxation time\nis essentially looking\nat how quickly some of that\nspinning returns to rest.\nAnd in particular,\nthe fact that the relaxation\ntimes are different\nfor aqueous, that is liquid,\nversus lipid, fatty versus other\ncomponents of brain tissue.\nAnd basically what this study shows\nis that the membranes of neurons\nwithin the brains of these people\nwith bipolar disorder,\nshowed more fluidity,\nmore ability of things to move\nin and around the membranes,\nwhich we know is an important\ncomponent of neuroplasticity\nin bipolar subjects that were treated\nwith omega-3 fatty acids as compared\nto bipolar subjects that did not receive\nomega-3 fatty acids.\nAnd fortunately this study also include\na healthy comparison group where\nthey could essentially find\nthat people with bipolar\ndisorder who supplemented\nwith omega-3 had changes\nat the cellular level\nand the neural circuit level\nthat brought their brains\nand neural circuits closer to that\nof the healthy comparison subjects.\nSo while I don't want to\npoint to omega-3 fatty acid\nsupplementation as the\nbe-all end-all of treatment\nfor bipolar disorder, certainly it is not,\nit does have a strong\nmechanistic basis for\nits possible support of neural circuitry,\nof neuroplasticity, and in particular,\nthe ability to make\nchanges in cell membranes\nthat are very reminiscent of some\nof the neural circuit changes\nand changes in membrane fluidity\nthat are seen with lithium treatment\nand other known\nprescription drug treatments\nthat have been established now for decades\nto be very effective for bipolar disorder.\nSo what that says is that\nomega-3 supplementation,\nwhile not the only intervention\nthat one should consider\nis something to consider and\ntalk about with your doctor\nand it's operating in powerful ways.\nIt's not just that it's\nchanging, for instance,\nyour gut microbiome, which is powerful,\nbut is indirect to the brain,\nit does seem to be having\ndirect effects on neurons\nand neural circuits.\nBefore we begin to conclude our discussion\nabout bipolar disorder,\nI want to talk a little bit\nabout this word, disorder,\nand this is a theme\nthat doesn't just relate\nto bipolar disorder,\nbut other psychiatric disorders as well.\nAnd when we think of a disorder,\nwe think of something that\nis really detrimental to us.\nSomething that really impairs\nour ability to function\nin work, in school, in relationships,\nand really starts to pull\ndown our health status\nin a variety of ways.\nAnd certainly bipolar\ndisorder meets those criteria.\nHowever,\nthere is this idea that\nthings like bipolar disorder,\neven things like\nschizophrenia in some cases\nare responsible for some\nof the creative aspects\nor the creative works\nthat have been observed\nand carried out by human\nbeings for many centuries.\nAnd believe it or not, there are good data\nto support the fact that\ncertain aspects of mania\nare associated with creativity.\nNow, we are long overdue for\nan episode about creativity,\nits neural circuit\nbasis, its chemical basis\nhere on the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nand certainly we will\nhave that conversation.\nBut in the meantime, I'd like\nto just briefly touch upon\nthis idea that certain\noccupations are associated\nwith a higher incidence\nof bipolar depression.\nAnd in fact,\nit's been explored at a research level.\nThere are data pointed to the fact\nthat certain individuals\nof certain occupations\ntend to be more creative\nand that creativity\nis associated with, again, associated,\nthis isn't causal, it's\nassociated, correlated with\nhigher levels or incidents\nof bipolar depression\nand maybe even other forms of depression.\nSo this is a study\nlooking at mood disorders\nin eminent individuals.\nSo these are people that are\nnot just good at what they do,\nbut are exceptional at what they do,\nand explored the percentage\nof people in given professions\nwith either depression or mania.\nAnd this was actually a data set gleaned\nfrom more than a thousand\n20th Century Westerners\nbased on their biographies that were\nreviewed by other people.\nSo it's a bit of an indirect measurement.\nThis isn't psychiatrist\ndata, this is data,\nor I should say these are data\nthat were compiled from self reports\nor from reads of self reports.\nAnd they explored a number\nof different professions.\nSo for instance, they looked\nat people in the military\nor people who were professional athletes\nor natural scientists\nor social scientists,\npeople who occupied\npositions in public office,\nor were musical performers,\nartists, nonfiction\nwriters, poetry, et cetera.\nThere are a lot of professions here.\nI will post this or I'll post a link to it\nin the show note captions\nfor you to peruse,\nbut I'll just give you\na sense of the extremes\non this graph because\nthey're very interesting.\nTurns out that if you were\nto look at the profession\nor I should say among the\nprofessions they looked at\nin this study, 'cause they\ndidn't look at all professions,\nthose in the military and those\nwho are professional athletes or had jobs\nin the social or natural\nsciences, of those,\nthere was a lower percentage of those\nthat had depression or mania.\nIn some cases like those who\nwere professional athletes\ndidn't seem to have, there\nwas no incidence of mania,\nat least in this dataset,\nwhereas at the opposite\nextreme of the graph,\nthose that were poets, so\nthese are eminent individuals,\npeople that were exceptional poets,\nexceptional fiction writers,\nexceptional artists or\nnon-fiction writers,\nwell there, especially for the poets,\nyou find that as many as 90%\nof these very successful poets\nhad either depression or mania.\nAs high as 90%, that's incredible.\nContrast that with military\nwhere it's as few as 10%\nor professional athletes\nwhere it's as few as 20%,\nand for the professional\nathletes, as I mentioned before,\nnone of them had mania.\nSo does this mean that being a poet\nwill make you manic or depressed?\nWell, first of all, let's\nlook at the poetry category.\nIt turns out that 75%\nof these eminent poets,\nthese highly accomplished\npoets had major depression,\nwhereas only about 20% of\nthose poets had manic episodes.\nSo again, it's not that being a poet\nis going to give you mania,\ncertainly we're not saying that,\nit's not that being a poet is\ngoing to give you depression,\nbut it turns out that\npeople with depression\nand people with depression and mania\nseem to gravitate towards poetry\nor at least are very successful at poetry.\nAgain, associative, correlative,\nno causal relationship here.\nBut it is really striking to see\nhow the creative\noccupations, poetry, fiction,\nart, non-fiction writing,\neven though non-fiction\nwriting is about non-fiction,\nit's still creative, music\ncomposition, theater,\nmuch higher incidents\nof things like mania.\nIn fact, for the people\nin theater, the actors,\neven though the overall\noccurrence of depression\nand mania is lower\nthan that in poets, the fraction of those\nindividuals that have\nmania is exceedingly high.\nIt's about 30% of those\nthat they looked at\nwho are actors,\nhave manic episodes or\nhave full blown mania.\nSo I'm referring to these\ndata because first of all,\nI find them incredibly interesting,\nright up until now we've been talking\nabout bipolar disorder\nand other mood disorders\nfor their maladaptive effects.\nAnd again, they're extremely maladaptive,\nmuch, much higher instance\nof suicide, et cetera,\nbut we'd be wrong to\nsay that certain aspects\nof manic episodes don't\nlend themselves well\nto creativity or that certain aspects\nof major depression don't\nlend themselves well\nto creativity or to the performing arts\nor to poetry.\nThat said, in no way, shape or form,\ndo I believe that being\ndepressed is a good thing\nor that being manic is a good thing.\nAgain, we return to the\nbasic foundational criteria\nfor bipolar disorder, major depression\nwhich is that the pressured\nspeech, the not sleeping,\nthe incredible increases in energy\nand the flights of ideas\nare generally not going to lead,\nor I think it's fair to say,\nare not going to lead to good places.\nIn fact, often lead to bad places.\nBut we would also be wrong if\nwe didn't consider the fact\nthat there is a somewhat\ninextricable relationship\nbetween mania and creativity.\nAnd it could be that hypomania\nor brief periods of mania,\nmaybe even an hour a day\nor 30 minutes a day of\ncomposing or writing poetry,\nmaybe even some of the lows that we feel,\nsome of the sadness, some of the grief,\nsome of the nostalgia that we feel\nprovided that it's not pathologic,\nthat it's not persistent\nfor the four or seven days\nthat are diagnostic of bipolar 2\nand bipolar 1 disorder respectively,\nwell, then we can start\nto view emotional states\nas something that can\nactually lend themselves\nto positive outcomes and\nmaybe even to creativity\nand to improved occupations.\nSo it's important that\nwe have a nuanced view\nof what sadness versus depression\nversus major depression are,\nit's important that we distinguish between\nbeing erratic, being very energized,\nand full blown bipolar disorder.\nAnd I raise this for\nanother reason as well.\nNowadays, it's very common\nto hear people saying, ah, you know,\nthat person is OCD.\nWell, on the episode about OCD\nthat I did a few weeks back,\nthat you can find if you\nlike at hubermanlab.com,\nin that episode, I pointed out that OCD,\nobsessive-compulsive\ndisorder is very maladaptive.\nI think it's number seven, as I recall\non the list of debilitating diseases,\nall diseases in terms\nof lost time at work,\nsuffering relationships, et cetera.\nSo it's a really serious condition.\nAnd yet we often hear, oh,\nthat person is obsessive.\nAnd as I pointed out,\nthere is obsessive-compulsive\npersonality disorder.\nAnd then there is\nobsessive-compulsive tendencies,\nwhich actually benefit people,\nbut that is distinct from\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\nas a clinically diagnosed thing.\nSimilarly, we hear that, oh,\nsomebody's being bipolar.\nYou know, they're all over the place.\nThey're bipolar.\nWell, that's a very subjective\nlabel that people give\none another in passing,\nmore and more often I'm hearing this,\nand yet bipolar disorder,\nwhether or not it's BP-1 or BP-2\nare extremely maladaptive\nand extremely associated\nwith high suicide risk.\nSo while I'm not here to police people,\nI'm not certainly not the word police\nor the nomenclature police,\nI do think that whether or\nnot you refer to people as OCD\nor as bipolar, et\ncetera, that's up to you,\nit's not my place to say,\nbut I do think it's important\nthat all of us understand\nthat these psychiatric\nconditions carry with them\ntremendous maladaptive weight.\nSo today we've really done a deep dive\ninto bipolar disorder\nand to both the manic\nand the depressive components\nthat are present or can be present\nin bipolar disorder\nand the different forms\nof bipolar disorder and\nsome of the major treatments\nfor bipolar disorder,\nin particular lithium and\nits underlying mechanisms\nand some of the neural\ncircuit and chemical basis\nand neuroplasticity\nbasis of the treatments\nfor bipolar disorder, in\nparticular homeostatic scaling\nor homeostatic plasticity.\nAll of that, of course, is\nrelevant to bipolar disorder\nand I hope will be useful\nin your understanding\nand maybe even in your\npursuit of treatments\nfor bipolar depression,\nbipolar disorder for you\nor other people.\nI also hope that it will be\nuseful in your understanding\nof how brain circuits work\nin normal conditions or in conditions\nwhere there is no disease state\nor maladaptive conditions.\nHomeostatic plasticity\nis present in all of us.\nMembrane fluidity due to how\neasily things move around\nin the surface, the fatty\nlayers on the outside of neurons\nand the movement of receptors\nin and out of neurons\nthat is present in all of us.\nThe influence of omega-3 fatty acids\nis central to that discussion.\nAs is the discussion about\nvarious drug treatments\nbecause even if you're\nnot somebody who's taking\na drug treatment or who is\npursuing a drug treatment\nfor bipolar disorder or\nanother psychiatric condition,\nyour serotonin levels,\nyour dopamine levels,\nyour acetylcholine\nlevels, all of these play\ninto what we call your\nmental and physical health.\nIn fact, if any of you are interested\nin the various categories\nof neuromodulators\nand tools to adjust those neuromodulators\nunder more standard\nnon-disease conditions,\nwe did an episode\non neurochemicals and how to control them.\nYou can find that at hubermanlab.com\nalong with all
