    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr James\nHollis Dr James Hollis is a jungian\npsychoanalyst and author of more than 17\nbooks about the self relationships and\nhow to create the best possible life\nsome of the notable titles and topics of\nthose books include creating a life\nfinding your individual path as well as\nthe Eden project in search of the\nmagical other which as the name suggests\nis about relationships he has also\nwritten about how to access our most\nresilient self in the book entitled\nliving Between Worlds finding personal\nresilience in changing times during\ntoday's discussion Dr Hollis teaches us\nwhat questions we need to ask of\nourselves on a regular basis in order to\nbest understand who we really are and\nwhat we most Des desire at the level of\nvocation romantic relationships\nfriendship and family and indeed in\nrelationship to life's journey what\nyou'll quickly realized during today's\ndiscussion with Dr Hollis is that while\nyes he is trained as a yian\npsychoanalyst he is also very firmly\ngrounded in Practical tools that is he\nteaches us the simple and yet practical\ntools that we can each and all apply on\na daily basis in order to make sure that\nwe are staying on our best path we\ndiscuss how family dynamics that we grew\nup in as well as trauma and attachment\nStyles combined with our unique gifts\nand indeed our shadow side as well in\norder to drive us down particular\ntrajectories in life that sometimes lead\nus where we want to go but other times\nlead us astray and when they do how to\nget back on track today's conversation\nwith Dr Hollis is truly a special one in\nthat he rarely does podcast appearances\nin fact we travel to him to record this\npodcast that's how motivated I was to be\nable to sit down with him because I'm\nfamiliar with his many books and his\nincredible teachings but I really wanted\nto get his knowledge collected in one\nformat in one place and what I can\npromise you is that by the end of\ntoday's podcast you will be thinking\ndifferently about yourself about the\npeople in your life and indeed life\nitself before we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and research roles at\nStanford it is however part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero cost to\nConsumer information about science and\nscience related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is matina\nmatina makes loose leaf and ready to\ndrink ybba mate now I've long been a fan\nof yerbamate as a source of caffeine in\npart because of its high antioxidant\ncontent as well as its ability to\nelevate glucagon like peptide 1 or glp1\nwhich leads to a slight appetite\nsuppressing effect as well as its\nability to regulate blood sugar and\npossible neuroprotective effects I also\njust happen to love the way that\nyerbamate tastes I'll sometimes drink it\nhot by pouring hot water over the loose\nleaf yerbamate and I'm particularly fond\nthese days of drinking the zero sugar\ncold brew matina yerbamate that I help\ndevelop now I realize that there are a\nlot of different brands of loose leaf\nand canned and bottled yerbamate out\nthere but the reason I like matina the\nmost is first of all it has absolutely\nthe best taste of all of them secondly\nthey only use organic ingredients and\nthirdly because they offer low sugar and\nzero sugar varieties if you'd like to\ntry matina you can go to drink maa.com\nhuberman that's spelled drink

licensed\ntherapist carried out online I've been\ngoing to therapy for well over 30 years\ninitially I didn't have a choice it was\na condition of being allowed to stay in\nschool but pretty soon I realized that\ntherapy is extremely valuable in fact I\nconsider doing regular therapy just as\nimportant as getting regular exercise\nincluding cardiovascular exercise and\nresistance training which of course I\nalso do every week the reason I know\ntherapy is so valuable is that if you\ncan find a therapist with whom you can\ndevelop a really good rapport you not\nonly get terrific support for some of\nthe challenges in your life but you also\ncan derive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life your\nrelationship life but of of course also\nthe relationship to yourself and to your\nprofessional life to all sorts of career\ngoals in fact IC therapy is one of the\nkey components for meshing together all\naspects of one's

talk to you today thank\nyou Andrew it's a privilege to be with\nyou thank you let's talk about the self\nthis is something that I think people\noccasionally wonder about you know who\nwho am I we wake up every day we have\nsome stable representation of who we are\nin our name most of the time and we\ndevelop a self a story MH based on what\nwe know about our parents our siblings\nour life from the perspective of yion\npsychology maybe psychology generally\nhow should we think about\nourselves well first of all the idea of\nthe self with a capital S to distinguish\nit from the ego Consciousness that is to\nsay my conscious presence as you and I\nare talking right now um is a\nTranscendent other it's a mystery it's\num essentially governed by our instincts\nyou know it's nature seeking its own\nexpression and its own healing what I've\nseen in terms of the activity of the\nself through the years it has two\nagendas one healing when injured and\nsecondly expressing itself in the same\nway that the acorn becomes the oak tree\nso to speak um now the ego of course is\nthat little cintilla of energy that we\nbegins to Cluster we're born without an\nego but then there's this sbl shards of\nexperience between the the me and the\nnot me that slowly accumulate almost in\nTidal pools so that I begin to\ndifferentiate myself from the other my\nmother let's say or my father or the\nobject that is there and you're right we\nare an animal that seeks to understand\nas part of our adaptation to the world\nand so we are narrative animals we\ncreate stories about it and our stories\nrise out of what we're experiencing at\nthe moment so you can see why a person\nbornn into a certain culture or a\ncertain family of origin with its style\nof relating or disr as the case may be\nuh becomes the ground for defining that\nperson's sense of self so it's important\nto distinguish between the self and\none's sense of self the sense of self is\nwho I think I am in any given moment\nthat's very fluid of course now we have\nall kinds of internal clusters of energy\nthat are called complexes a ter that\nyoung\nized and complexes are uh Splinter\npersonalities he said so a person might\nsay why did I get so upset yesterday\nwhat what came over me or I don't know\nwhat I was thinking when I made this\nimportant\ndecision and that's our recognition that\nwe were in an altered state at that\nmoment that it that something within us\nhad been triggered had sufficient energy\nto come up usurp ego Consciousness and\ntake it over actually the term that y\nused in in German meant possession it's\na state of psychic possession\ntemporarily you know we we joke that\nlovers are fools or lovers are blind so\nwe know that people are in a certain\nthey're caught in a certain projection\nonto the to the other and you know that\nultimately gets um you know resolved\ninto some sort of reality through time\nand and experience with that\nindividual but in that state of being\none senses that one's making the right\ndecision and no one wakes in the morning\nand says for example well today I think\nI'm going to do the same stupid\ncounterproductive things I've done for\ndecades but there's a good chance we\nwill why because we have certain\nclusters of energy in us that are\nregularly triggered when triggered they\ncatalyze a response in the ego that\nenacts that program so it affects our\nbody it affects our our script and of\ncourse it affects our our per I of self\nand world so you know from the\nstandpoint of of therapy one of the\nthings we try to do is suggest to people\nyou're not what happened to you because\none of our Tendencies is to internalize\nwhatever is happening to us and thinking\nof that defines us of course the younger\nthe more less formed we are uh the more\nwe're likely to be defined by poverty or\nby disease or by alcoholism or or by\nsexism or or whatever the social\nconstructs are into which we're born as\nwell as the psychodynamics of the family\nof origin so in those\ncircumstances uh we all have a\nprovisional sense of\nself and if you have a culture that says\nthis is who you are this is what you're\nyour your orders are your your marching\norders here's your script and the more\nauthoritarian the culture or or the more\ntraumatic one's environmental situation\nand family of origin the more likely I'm\ngoing to be reacting to that\nso when I've had an experience I'm\neither going to repeat it or I'm going\nto try to run from it or maybe I'll be\nspending my life trying to treat it in\nsome way that I'm not aware\nof um this activates many people into\nthe healing professions by the way\nwhether it's clergy nursing therapy etc\netc that that's often a sensitive child\nin the family who feels I have to try to\nstabilize my environment in order to uh\nso get things back to a a normal State\nwhatever that might be so that then it\ncan be there for me but of course that\nnever quite happens you know a child\ncan't fix a parent you see and so many\npeople in the helping\nprofessions um are are driven there by a\npowerful internalized message which\nbecomes their sense of self so it's a\nlong-winded way of saying there's\ndistinction between the self which is\nthe natural organic development of this\norganism you know as we're speaking it's\ngrowing our toenails digesting our\nbreakfast mentating emoting and so forth\nmost of that's autonomous activity it's\nkind of like the centipede you know you\ncongratulate the centipede on how well\nhe coordinates all of his legs and then\nhe thinks well should I move this leg or\nthis leg or this and he's immobilized\nthese are not functions that we govern\nconsciously although we can interrupt\nthem consciously but something is there\ntaking care of us it's an organic Unity\nand that's what you meant by the by the\nself capital S our sense of self is a\ndifferent matter and so one of the\nthings that I've tried to emphasize in\ntherapy is you're not what happened to\nyou because we tend to be bound to our\nstory that says either that's who I am\nthat's what I'm defined by or I'm\nspending my life trying to differentiate\nmyself from that get away from that\nperhaps so um again our sense of self is\nvery provisional it evolves and and in\nany given moment there may be something\nin the unconscious that's um triggered\nand of course the problem with the\nunconscious it's unconscious so I don't\nknow that it's happened it's I I have\nthe unconscious uh triggered it has the\npower to rise take over provisionally\nspin out its program and then after a\nwhile you know it recedes back into the\nunconscious and as I said sometimes\npeople will stop and say well I wonder\nwhat was behind that decision or why did\nI choose that path or what in me is\nblocking me from doing what I know is\nright for me you know as uh Paul said in\nthe letter to the Romans though I know\nthe good I do not do the good well why\nnot well he saw it as in insufficiency\nof will but we know it's more than that\nwe we know that there are unconscious\nfactors at work that have a certain\nautonomy and the more unconscious they\nare the greater their autonomy will\nprove to be\nif they are unconscious and they're\ndriving us sometimes into States other\ntimes traits I mean and that's a perhaps\nan interesting discussion in of itself\nis you know when what's the difference\nbetween a state of mind and body and a\ntrait but if it's\nunconscious what chance do we stand to\novercome these things I mean what\nwhere how does the awareness come about\ncan we do it on our own does it require\nReflection from a trained professional\nand if so um you\nknow when we become conscious of\nsomething does that immediately flip a\nswitch or does it require constant\nreturning to um you know seeing and uh\nfor you know forcing the the unconscious\nto become conscious over and over again\nsure well those are great questions um f\nfirst of all again none of us rise us\nsaying we're going to be\ncounterproductive today but we will\nbecause of the autonomy of those\nclusters of energy within us now I've\nsaid to many people who've asked that\nquestion well start with your own life\nlook to the patterns that you have a\npattern is an\nindication of some cluster of energy\nwhether it's outward or whether it's\ninward that you're carrying with you um\nand we don't do crazy things we always\ndo logical things if we understand that\nwhat we're in service to iny Ally I give\nyou an example I was working in a closed\nward of a hospital many decades ago and\nthere was a fellow repeatedly trying to\nbreak a window people were assuming he\nwas trying to escape or get a Shard of\nglass for some nefarious purpose and no\none bothered to ask him why he was doing\nthis and he said he had the delusion\nthat he was first of all in a locked\nWard so he was caught in a you know\nnon-voluntary\nsituation and in his psychosis he felt\nthat um somebody was pumping air from\nthe room now if this door was locked and\nthe air is being pumped out of this room\nthe most logical thing we would do is\nbreak through a window or break down the\ndoor so his behavior was logical based\non the premise now the premise is often\ninaccurate or tied to one place but gets\nextrapolated to another one somewhere\nelse and and then we are responding\nlogically to that that premise so you\nstart with your own life particularly\nthe places where you you find these are\nself-defeating behaviors or behaviors\nthat are hurtful to you and someone else\nand then you say since that's not my\nconscious intention and yet there it is\nas part of my history then I have to say\nall right what is it within me that you\nknow has the kind of power to take over\nmy ego Consciousness now just to back\noff for a moment here I I think we're\nonly conscious in the ego dealing with\nreality uh a few times during the course\nof a day my favorite analogy is when you\nget up in the morning and you step in\nthe shower it's too hot or too cold so\nyou change the water temperature well\nthat's the ego and its proper function\nit's being adaptive to its reality it's\nbeing protective at that moment it's\nachieving the optimum situation for you\nbut from the rest of time on when that\nsame ego is flooded by other material\nsome of which just conscious who gets\nthe kids today after school how do I get\nto the work on time Etc but underneath\nthat are other drivers that have to do\nwith fear-based responses or adaptive\nresponses that um were perhaps once\nprotective but later you know we weren't\nborn with them but we acquired them\nalong Life's Highway so what was once\nprotective often becomes constrictive\nlater and and creates those patterns so\nthe number one you start with your\npatterns um secondly and everyone sort\nof laughs at this but there's a certain\ntruth you might talk to those around you\nsuch as your spouse or your closest\npartner or or your children and ask them\nabout what they see in us if you can\nbear to hear what they have to say and\nto say where is it you see me being\nhurtful to myself or others or where is\nit that I get in your face in an\ninappropriate way uh and they'll usually\nhave something to inform us with thirdly\nwe pay attention to our dreams because\nwe don't choose to dream but sleep\nresearch tells us that we average about\nsix dreams per night that's a lot of\nactivity nature doesn't waste energy\nit's processing something and it's not\njust processing if we pay attention over\ntime um you begin to realize it has a\npoint of view another way of putting\nthis is the psyche which is the term I\nwould use here and that's the Greek word\nfor Soul by the way the the the psyche\nyou know has its own intentionality it's\nomnipresent and it's commenting and it\ncomments in terms of our feeling\nfunction you don't choose your feelings\nfeelings are autonomous responses to\nwhat has happened you can repress them\nsuppress them anesthetize them project\nthem onto others but you are in the end\num you know a creature that has an\nautonomous feeling response secondly we\nhave energy systems if I'm doing what's\nright for me the energy is there the\nflow is there\nwe can mobilize our energy and we have\nto in life to get up and feed the baby\nat 2: in the morning or um you know put\nin our 40-hour week or whatever the\nrequirements are uh but over time uh\nforcing the Energy System leads as we\nknow to boredom and burnout and\nultimately depression often with\nself-medication attached to that um\nthirdly we have dreams which\ncomment um fourthly most importantly is\nthe question of meaning if what we're\ndoing is Meaningful as understood by the\npsyche it will support us even in the\nface of suffering and sacrifice and so\nforth if what we're doing is wrong as\nseen by the\npsyche then over time it begins to\npathologize so you take that word\nPsychopathology literally from the Greek\nit means the expression of the suffering\nof the\nSoul which I think is\nratory the expression of the suffering\nof the Soul now that seems to me\nobligatory to take\nseriously if my soul and again that's a\nmetaphor you know people look for the\nsoul throughout history and you can't\nfind it in the pineal gland for example\nthe Soul's a metaphor for the organic\nwisdom of that natural being that we\nare the soul is a metaphor for uh this\npurposeful expression of the organism it\nis\npurposeful in other words question that\noccupies all of us in childhood and\nthroughout the first half of Life at\nleast if not an entire lifetime is what\ndoes the world want of me what do my\nparents want from me what do my school\nteacher want me what do The Playmates\nexpect of me what does the partner want\nfor me what does the employer want all\nof these are reality-based encounters\nwith the demands of the environment and\nand part of what we have to do is\ndevelop enough ego strength to create a\nprovisional sense of self and a\nprovisional functional self to deal with\nthose expectations but then when you've\ndone that you know why are you still\nhere what's the purpose are you simply\nhere to be a creature of\nadaptations now without those\nadaptations we would be overwhelmed\ntypically by the circumstances of our\nlives so we accommodate them in some\nway but in the second half of life and\nI'm using a ter very\nLoosely um the real question is what\ndoes the soul want of me you know what\ndoes the psyche want of me that's a\ndifferent question then the issue comes\nup what is it that is wishing expression\nin the world through me that's a\ndifferent question then what does the\nworld ask of me the people that we would\nmost admire in history are people who in\nsome way found and lived out what the\nsoul was asking of them it didn't spare\nthem from suffering sometimes even\nmartyrdom it doesn't spare you from\nconflict and pain maybe isolation maybe\nExile but you're fed by the\npurposefulness of it take that away and\nlife is pretty\nempty and of course we live in a culture\nwhere there's this enormous barrage of\nexternal stimuli well buy this purchase\nthat do this or that the latest thing\nand this or that the newest shin\nand the more I'm seeking to Define\nmyself through that environmental\nsummons the more likely I'm going to be\naranged from something inside all of us\nknow it but we don't know what to do\nabout that at some level and typically\nit has to hurt enough inside to bring a\nperson into therapy people don't just\nwalk in and say well I was in the\nneighborhood and I thought I'd pop in\nand talk to a total stranger pay him\nsome money and then you know walk out as\na different person doesn't work that way\nI I've often said to people this is not\nabout curing you because you're not a\ndisease this is\nabout uh making your life more\ninteresting where you realize every\nmorning you get up um you have something\nprofound to address\ntoday why am I here and in service to\nwhat because if you don't ask that\nquestion you're going to be in service\nto your adaptive postures from childhood\nas many people prove to be until the\nconflict within reaches that point where\nthe suffering of the Soul\nPsychopathology is\nsufficient um I myself was cruising\nalong in my 30s I'd achieved everything\nthat I wanted to achieve and was\nenjoying my life and then suddenly\ninexplicably had a very serious\ndepression and it took me a while to\nrealize that I was asking the wrong\nquestion the first question that occurs\nto a person under those circumstances is\nis um how quickly do I get rid of this\nyou know give me five easy steps or a\npill for that or whatever I didn't\nunderstand the real question is why has\nyour psyche autonomously withdrawn its\napproval and support from the agenda\nthat you've been addressing it was a\ngood agenda nothing wrong with it but\nthere was something else that was\nmissing in this process and it took a\ndepression like something from below\nreached up and pulled me down something\nwas being pressed down down that's\ndepression and at the bottom of that\nwell there's always a task there's\nalways an issue the identification of\nwhich can lead one into a new place in\none's life a different journey in my\ncase it it led me\nto uh leave a very fine tenure position\nin\nAcademia travel to Switzerland and spend\nseveral years there in retraining as as\na psycho analyst and uh I now look upon\nthat depression as beneficent but at the\ntime I certainly didn't as you can\nimagine I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now\nmost of you have heard me tell my story\nabout how I've been taking ag1 once or\ntwice a day every day since 2012 and\nindeed that's true I started taking ag1\nand I still take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as a adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed Whole\nFoods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning and often\ntimes also again in the afternoon or\nevening I'm ensuring that I'm getting\neverything I need I'm covering all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nregularly just report feeling better and\nthat shouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman so if our task is to get in\ntouch with this kind of Yearning of the\nSoul um to perhaps do some reparative\nwork from our childhood or at least\nunderstand our parent child\nrelationships and then in an ideal\ncircumstance\nto express ourselves through some higher\ncalling if you will but higher meaning\nfor us or for the world hopefully both\nthat's that would be\nideal in terms of the day you know you\nsaid you you you can wake up in the\nmorning presumably some of the residual\nthought processes and emotions from a\ndream or dreams still live within us\nearly in the day and then we start going\nabout our day doing the Practical things\nmaking the cup of coffee drinking the\nwater getting some sunshine uh these\nsorts of things\nhow is it\nthat the typical person any of us can\nthink about segmenting our thinking and\nour actions in a way that we're touching\ninto the deeper meaning of life while\nalso carrying out a life because as you\nknow and I know and everybody listening\nand watching knows that there's stuff to\ndo we need we need to often get an\neducation make a living tend to people\naround us tend to ourselves and and it\nbecomes a a a kind of a\nNeuroscience problem in my mind right\nyou know different brain circuitries for\ndifferent types of thinking and if I may\nit I think it also becomes a time\nperception problem you know the brain\nthe human brain to me is so magnificent\nat setting Milestones that are like get\nin the shower finish the shower check\nthe text messages talk to somebody and\nget about the day the Milestones become\nvery close in and then if we're lucky\nenough to be able to take a walk and\nreflect put the phone away Etc then our\nmind can expand into you know gosh why\nam I here you know uh what about my that\nthing my grandfather said to me or my\ngrandmother said to me and you know that\nthe ability to to place our perception\nin larger or smaller time bins seems\nvery closely linked to all of this um\nand to the sense of mortality which\nwe'll certainly talk about in a little\nbit but in in a kind of a practical way\nin the absence of a daily therapy\nsession um how\nhow do you suggest people start to\nsegment um or um compartmentalize in a\nway that's functional for instance um\nshould people set aside 15 minutes each\nmorning to just think about why they're\non this Earth uh and why they're doing\nand what they're doing as opposed to\njust doing sure well this is a central\nproblem of our time is is um everybody\nis going to say I don't have time for\nthat\nI had a colleague now deceased Maran\nWoodman in Toronto who used to say to\nher clients you have to guarantee me one\nhour per day that you reflect on your\ndreams or you you journal in terms of\nwhat's going on in your life and she\nsaid always people say I don't have time\nfor that then she said then you you\ndon't have time for\ntherapy you don't you're not making any\npriority here for this and you're right\nthe claims of you know woodsworth wrote\nIn 1802 the world is too much with us\ngetting and spending we lay waste our\npowers this is 1802 before the internet\nright with all of its claims upon us\nthere's such a noisy Den around us we're\nall distracted by that you see that's\nwhy it usually takes a crisis in a\nmarriage or depression or whatever the\ncase may be to get people to pull out of\nthat and reflect upon that so I spend 15\nminutes every morning before starting uh\njust meditating particularly working on\na dream if I've had a dream and and\nsecondly I reflect on things in the\nevening too because one of the things we\nwant to try to do is to say what are the\nstories I'm living here you know one of\nthem I've got to earn a living one of\nthem I've got to do this another one I\nhave to do that you see but but what's\nall that frenzy about you see that's why\nI think the first half of life and I say\nthis semih humorously is a huge and\nunavoidable mistake because we're living\njust reactively you see it's not\ngenerative it's reacting to whatever is\ngoing on around us is one's entire life\nto be spent reacting to\nthings now when you're young there's\nonly so much ego strength to to reflect\nupon this a number of years ago I was\nasked to give a talk to an advanced\ngroup of uh college students at a\nuniversity on the psychodynamics of love\nwell they were all interested about love\nI can tell you right so it was a 3-hour\nseminar so over the first 90 minutes we\ntalked about projection transference all\nthese they got it they were smart kids\nand then we took a short break when we\ncame back and I said now let's apply\nthese ideas to your current or recent\nrelationships it was like the curtain\ncame down you know they were 1920 21 22\nin that area they couldn't bear they\ncould get the idea but they couldn't\nbear to look at themselves with that\nkind of scrutiny Flash Forward 20 years\nwhen they're 40 and their marriage just\ndissolved or um you know the the\nrelationship has hardships of one kind\nor another they're much more likely to\nbe able to a have enough ego strength to\nbear looking at\noneself secondly um there's enough life\nexperience to reflect\nupon because this kind of work takes\ncourage in the first place I have to be\nable to Bear to look at myself and see\nwhat's there which won't always be\npretty and and secondly it's\nhumbling because this is not about\nfeeling great it's about being called to\naccountability which is a whole\ndifferent matter to be an adult is not\njust to have a big body it's it's to\nknow that I'm accountable for what's\nspilling into the world through me you\nsaid once in one of those telling\nstatements that haunts me in a\nconstructive way he he said the greatest\nburden the child must bear is the\nunlived life of the parent so where I'm\nstuck as a person my children will be\nstuck or they'll be spending their life\ntrying to get unstuck you see so the\nbest thing I can do for them is to model\nfor them you know a life lived with as\nmuch courage as I can mobilize and as\nmuch Integrity as I can manage and in\ndoing that it not only models it gives\npermission to them\num one of the things I found for many\npeople they don't really feel\npermission to feel what they feel desire\nwhat they desire go out and fight for\nwhat matters to them because life we\nlearn early is conditional you will be\nacceptable in this family you will\nperhaps be loved you'll be rewarded or\nyou'll be punished if you meet these\nconditions and if you don't meet the\nconditions a lot of people put\nconditions on their on their children\nyou know a lot of people are still\nliving through their\nchildren um you know if you forgive the\njoke here there there's an old joke\nabout Jewish Mothers the fetus is not\nconsidered full term until it's\ngraduated from Medical School you see\nand that's an it's a joke about a\ncultural expectation and carrying\nsomeone else's unfinished business in a\nway in which you know is to make them\nfeel good rather than serve what is one\nexpression through you which is quite a\ndifferent matter so one of the things\none has to do is seize permission to\nrealize life is\nshort um we're we're here a very brief\ntime and the summons is to live your\njourney as honestly as you can and when\nyou do it ultimately serves other people\nit's not selfish it's actually serving\nthe self if you will it's not\nnarcissistic it's not self-absorption\nit's it's actually humbling\nI would never imagined as a child that I\nwould spend my adult life listening to\npeople's\nsuffering and yet that's my day job and\nI'm humbled to be invited into the lives\nof other people it's profoundly\nmeaningful I can't imagine living\nwithout that at the same time um it's\nnot fun it's not pleasant but it's\nprofoundly meaningful that's the\ndistinction that's why of those very\nvarious sources of insight that we can\nhave into our lives you have to ask\nabout what is most meaningful to me as\ndefined by the psychi not by the culture\naround you because what the culture says\nit's all about being successful it's all\nabout making money it's about living in\nthis neighborhood it's about buying that\nobject and if that worked we would know\nit it obviously doesn't so that's what\nbrings us back to that humbling moment\nthat maybe I'm not living my life sir in\nk guard the Danish Theologian in\nCopenhagen the 19th century talked about\na man who was shocked to find his name\nin the obituary column and he hadn't\nrealized he died because he hadn't\nrealized that he was here in the first\nplace now this is a carard talking in\nthe middle of the 19th century think\nabout the ramping up of the stimuli\naround us the the steady drum among\nyoung people you take away their cell\nphone they experience enormous anxiety\nbecause this is their link to the world\nand yet it's constantly making demands\nupon them so again underneath all of\nthis is we have an appointment with our\nown souls and the question is are you\ngoing to show up for the\nappointment and I thought I had but my\npsyche thought otherwise so it was in\nthe midst of a serious depression that I\nbegan showing up and it was a a\ndifficult process but ultimately proved\nto be I think\ntransformative like I certainly agree\nthat\nhardship for better or worse is often\nthe way that these things stimulate the\nself-reflection that's required for\nchange there seems to be a a tricky\nsituation whereby on the one hand I'm\nhearing and I agree that it all starts\nwith being very honest with oneself\nabout what one really wants yeah and I\nlove and thank you for mentioning this\n15 minutes in the early part of the day\nperhaps ideally 15 minutes at the end of\nthe day where one takes time away from\ninput from others of any form electronic\nor otherwise to just reflect on what's\ninside and the messages coming up\nthrough dreams and reflection Etc uh so\nimportant um and and may I just add\nanother pie forgive the interruption but\nI've often said to individuals it's not\nso much what you believe feel or do it's\nwhat it's in service to inside of you\nthat's an important distinction so I may\nthink I've done a good thing when it's\nreally an old\ncodependence or it's it's a way of\navoiding conflict or it's a fear-driven\nresponse we have to always be asking but\nwhat was that in service to inside of me\nand you may not know at first but you\nkeep asking the question it'll it'll\nit'll start you know rising to the\nsurface you begin to recognize that\nthat's how we begin to identify some of\nthose internal drivers that we call the\ncomplexes because again they they're\nthey clusters of energy with the power\nto create a provisional\npersonality and many times people are\nidentified with their complex that's who\nI am you know I am what I do I am my\nperformance rather than beneath all of\nthis is a human being who is wandering\nthrough life afraid of dying trying to\navoid pain as much as possible and um\nhoping that someone's going to step in\nand make it all\nright I'm certainly familiar with the\nfeeling of\num recognizing what I want but\nbeing afraid that if I were to express\nthat that it would not um would not be\naccepted certainly and that certainly\ncan create problems um I'm also familiar\nwith recognizing what I want and stating\nit very clearly and some people um\nfortunately respond in well but I think\nit's fair to say at least based on my\nexperience that when we are really\nhonest with ourselves and with others it\ndoesn't always land well right I mean um\nI pay a lot of attention probably too\nmuch to U messaging on social media in\nthe landscape of science and health it's\njust kind of the world I live in um much\nof the time these days uh and what i\nnotic is that there's a real\ngravitational pull of people to um\nwhat's called the one whatever they are\ninfluencers public figures or that that\nare just very clear about who they are\num at least in their own self-perception\nbut then here in lies the the twist it\nseems is that what I'm hearing is that\noften our self-perception is not\naccurate that's correct and it's almost\nfutile to try and convince people that\nwe are who we believe we are right and I\nhave a theory that's emerging it's not a\nformal theory that the internet and in\nparticular social Med media are is\nborderline it weaves back and forth\nbetween sane and psychotic yes as if a\nborderline person would projecting\neither adoration or total disgust and I\nI warn anybody now including myself if\nyou're going on social media you're\ninteracting with a\nborderline organism so you need to be\nprepared to be told in various ways\nsometimes subtle sometimes overt that\nyou're\nterrible and you also need to be\nprepared for\nimmense reward and being told that\nyou're spectacular simply by being there\nthat's what it is to interact with a\nborderline person and there's no\ncontrolling or predicting their um their\nflips so um in any event that's a little\nuh you know Theory that's emerging why\nwouldn't it be that way right you're the\npsychologist but why wouldn't it be that\nway because ultimately social media is\nthe emerging property of all these\nindividuals um okay so you've made it\nclear how one way to Anchor to the self\nand get in touch with what's really\ngoing on inside yes reflecting on dreams\nreflecting on what guers to the surface\njournaling perhaps\nmeditation ideally twice a day perhaps\ntherapy as well would be ideal yes but\nthen we move about our day and we do our\nbest to be the best version of ourselves\nright and when we get positive feedback\nwe tend to I think as you know\nneurobiological psychological organisms\ndo more of that do more of that um uh\nand it's sort of a bank account of sorts\nwe're going for a net positive balance\num and we tend to do less of the things\nthat give us negative\nfeedback except perhaps or go to social\nmedia where people seem to go on there\nspecifically for friction-based\ninteractions as well which is its own\nthing so as we move through life first\nhalf of Life second half of Life how is\nit that\nwe can Orient in time as I kind of put\nit before how can we\num Carry Out These daily or weekly or\nmaybe yearly Reflections in a way that\nreally serves us well I mean do you\nrecommend one day a week stepping away\nfrom everything do you recommend um\ndoing Retreats of sort do you recommend\nthat um people keep a life journal is\nthe story and seeing how one story\nevolves is this useful what I'm trying\nto do here is um kind of uh Orient\npeople to some practical tools because\num because I think at some\nlevel we can get pulled down currents of\nany kind that's right and ideally we we\nyou know stay out of deep\npathology but even if we hit the rumble\nstrips and go back over and over again\num this is this is important work right\nthis is this is about being the best\nversion of ourselves and Society\nbenefits from that so are there more\nmacroscopic things that we can do um or\nis it just a daily chip away two\nmeditations ideally Therapy Journal and\njust anchor down um like do we ever get\ndo we ever get to\nrelax well of course of course um f\nfirst of all there's no formula it's\napplicable to everybody in their life\ncircumstances you know the word\nPsychotherapy literally means from the\nGreek to listen to or pay attention to\nthe soul\nhowever you go about doing that is right\nfor you it's up to you to figure that\nout and for some people be working in\nnature for others to be working with\ntheir hands for others it'll be through\nsome creative Enterprise or working with\ntheir dreams or meditating or or\nwhatever um I would say whatever helps\nyou step out of the stimulus response\nstimulus response melee that we call our\ndaily life is likely to be helpful to\nyou either because you rest and you\nrestore the psyche and or you have some\nreflection upon it you you recollect\nyourself as it is right you remember the\nself because we get unraveled I often\nhave the feeling of getting unraveled in\nlife where you know this calls you and\nthis calls you and this calls you and\nthat calls you and you're just it's just\npulling you away where from from some\nCenter here and again this is not about\nself-absorption but if I'm not in\nconnection with something abiding here\nmy behaviors or choices there are not\ngoing to be very helpful in the long run\nyou see they're going to be merely\nresponsive to the demands of the\nenvironmental\ncircumstances one thing I enjoy doing\nfrom time to time is drawing I like\ndoing anatomical drawings and things of\nthat sort and I find that if if I engage\nin an activity that absorbs all of my\nattention yes even though I have zero\nminus one aspirations of becoming a\ncommercial artist or something of that\nsort that um two things happen one I\nexit the stimulus response\nworld and at the same time it's\ninevitable that some insight comes later\nthat's right what is that well I see I\nthink that's a good example though as\nyou said of exiting the stimulus\nresponse cycle because in that moment\nsomething in your psyche Rises to\nexpress itself through you and and you\nknow it's your drawing it we we could\nperhaps read that drawing and and\nperhaps interpret something of it you\nknow like the famous Roar shock for\nexample I mean what Roar shock's an ink\nplot when's an ink plot not an inklot\nwell when I confabulate a response to it\nyou see and that response is indicative\nof what is going on inside of me so\nthat's a good example I mean for some\npeople you know they they have those\nmoments when they're out jogging for\nexample or riding a bicycle or or\nwhatever whatever ever it does listening\nto music there's no right path for\neveryone it's like find the place where\nyou're able to be alone with yourself\nand if you can tolerate being with\nyourself and you pay attention something\nwill start coming up you see and and\nultimately ironically that's the cure to\nthe great disease of our time which is\nloneliness it's interesting that the UK\nand Japan\nnow have cabinet level posts for\nministers of loneliness so great is a\nlonely we've never been more connected\nin human history through our Electronic\nmedia and yet people are now isolated in\ntheir rooms talking to each other and I\nI saw a cartoon I probably New York or\nsomewhere where a couple was getting\nmarried and the the minister says to the\ncouple well text each other I do you\nknow it was ultimately a joke about how\nwe are so media dependent now that we're\ndisconnected from each other and so\nwhatever it is that helps you link to\nsomething in here you asked this\nquestion which I I'm also haunted by in\na constructive way he said we all need\nto find what supports us when nothing\nsupports\nus and that's ultimately the cure for\nloneliness that there's something inside\nof me that knows me better than\nme is\nis working hard to bring about a healthy\nresponse to whatever life brings and it\nhas a purposefulness to it an\nintentionality an\nexpression and when I'm in touch with\nthat I feel that sense of wholeness and\npurposefulness when I'm out of it when I\nstart unraveling so to speak and un just\nthat's how how we get exhausted and\nburned out and so forth so again this is\nI use that word recollecting remembering\nit's like pulling the pieces back\ntogether again in some way so what\nShakespeare said the um knitting the\nRavel raveled sleeve of care you see he\nhe was using the same metaphor of being\nunraveled in some\nway I love this notion of um spending\ntime alone and accessing one's deepest\nresource for self-care as a way to deal\nwith loneliness because ultimately I\nalso completely agree that stimulus\nresponse is the Hallmark of of text\nmessaging there can be useful sure\naspects of text messaging of course\ncoordinating plans Etc and communicating\nbut but certainly social media it's a\nyou know we have a stimulus response\ndevice some people think of it more like\na slot machine but it never actually\nReturns the jackpot is the is the issue\num and I also think that social media\ncan be terrific for educating and\nlearning as well um certainly much of\nwhat I do or strive to do I think time\nalone is incredibly beneficial so thank\nyou for for highlighting that and and\nalso that it doesn't take much you know\nmaybe even a half hour that's right walk\nor something of that sort if I may what\ndo you think happens when we exit that\nstimulus response mode do you think the\nunconscious mind is revealed a bit more\nto us um and I think of the unconscious\nmind um a a former guest on this podcast\num a psychiatrist described the\nunconscious is kind of like the the the\niceberg that's beneath the surface\nall the stuff going on that we're\nentirely unaware of do you think that\nthe water recedes a little bit\nabsolutely because there's no room for\nthe expression of of of whatever is\nwanting to be acknowledged within us\nwhen we're constantly responding to our\nenvironmental demands um one of the\nthings I try to do is walk a mile every\nday I've gone through some health issues\nin recent years and so I'm sort of in a\nphysical recovery stage of life and I\nmock a mile a day even though it's\nphysically difficult uh and I find that\nrevelatory because that's I I'm focused\non being present here rather than all of\nthe distractions there and that's one of\nthe things that I have found a form of\nmeditation if you will and what comes up\nfor me is often\nsurprising I've talked before in the\npodcast about meditation clinical\nhypnosis something called Yoga Nidra\nwhich is a self-directed relaxation\nsometimes call it non-sleep deep rest\nEtc and without taking us on a tangent\num I I raise this because we keep\ntalking about meditation and um I think\nto a lot of people meditation sounds\nlike something esoteric to me as a\nneuroscientist meditation is a\nperceptual exercise it can be done to\nenhance focus by focusing on a specific\nlocation behind the forehead or looking\nat a a light it can be um an uh open\nmonitoring meditation where you're\nintentionally not trying to focus on any\none thing but it at the end of the day\nit's a perceptual ex it's it's a\ndeliberate perceptual\nshift um much in the same way that if I\ndecide to you know listen to an opera\nwith my eyes closed that's a in some\nsense it's a meditation it's a\ndeliberate perceptual shift\num so a deliberate perceptual shift that\nwe're calling a meditation which I think\nis a great label for it that is directly\naimed at better understanding the UN\none's own unconscious processing so that\none can then lean\ninto the stimulus response parts of life\nwith more intentionality with less\nopportunity to hit the rumble strips or\ngo into the gutter um with a more\nauthentic response to it you see because\nit's more likely to be coming out of me\nrather than simply being reactive I\nthink that's the important thing what's\nso important about what you're saying is\nthat for years now we've heard about you\nknow meditation being important as a way\nto uh intervene in the Ulus\nresponse process yes um and people say\nbe responsive not reactive and it all\nsounds so wonderful just as sounding\nbeing gritty and resilient sounds\nwonderful but one of the things that's\nmany really important here that you're\nraising is that there are methods to do\nthis they almost always involve going\ninward or someone who can see what we\ncan't see pointing out blind spots in us\nthat's right well I I think again the\nissue is to still the traffic inside and\nbe present to the moment in whatever way\nthat is that's why I said a person can\nmeditate by work of the\nhands or by walking or something that\npulls one out of the the cycles that are\nrunning their their little script over\nand over and over so there are many\nforms of meditating and you know ancient\nTraditions have revealed that too\nthere's walking meditation and so forth\nand you mentioned music I think that's\nanother example to listen to music I\nthink takes one out of you know nature\nsaid once without music Life's a\nmistake and I think what he was getting\nat was there is a sense in which music\nhas no purpose except being itself so\nwhen we're really present to the music\nwe were in the midst of being if I'm\nwell we're at Spring right now as you\nand I are talking and it's beautiful in\nthe neighborhood and so I've been\nwatching the flowers emerge and so forth\num and and simply being present to that\nmeans some of that other traffic is\nstilled and then I return and the\ntraffic resumes but maybe I have a\nlittle more of a sense of who I am and\nfrom whence I'm responding you see as a\nresult of that reentering process you\nknow the the Zen folks talk about being\nno minded I think that it was their way\nof talking about being present to this\nmoment but but not consumed by the\ndemands of this moment and that's that's\na difficult thing to manage but it's\nessential I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge one of our sponsors\nwaking up waking up is a meditation app\nthat offers hundreds of guided\nmeditations mindfulness trainings yoga\nneeder sessions and more I started\nmeditating over three decades ago and\nwhat I found in the ensuing years is\nthat sometimes it was very easy for me\nto do my daily meditation practice I was\njust really diligent but then as things\nwould get more stressful which of course\nis exactly when I should have been\nmeditating more my meditation practice\nwould fall off with we piing up they\nmake it very easy to find and\nconsistently use a given meditation\npractice it has very convenient\nreminders and they come in different\nduration so even if you just have one\nminute or five minutes to meditate you\ncan still get your meditation in which\nresearch shows is still highly\nbeneficial in addition to the many\ndifferent meditations on the waking up\napp they also have Yoga Nidra sessions\nwhich are a form of non-sleep deep rest\nthat I personally find is extremely\nvaluable for restoring mental and\nphysical Vigor I tend to do a yoga NRA\nlasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes\nat least once a day and if I ever wake\nup in the middle of the night and I need\nto fall back asleep I also find Yoga\nNidra to be extremely useful if you'd\nlike to try the waking up app you can go\nto waking up.com huberman to try a free\n30-day trial again that's waking up.com\nhuberman perhaps we can talk about the\nshadow this notion of the shadow um\nsounds very ominous um what is the\nShadow and are people aware of their\nshadows and if they're not how can they\nbecome aware of them and how can they\nwork with them well a shadow was yung's\nmetaphor for those parts of our own\npsyche and our our affiliation with\ngroups for example whether it's a\nreligious group educational group a\nnational identity that when brought to\nConsciousness we find troubling perhaps\ncontradictory to our values or um you\nknow inimical to our sense of self-worth\nor something like that for example\ntypical Shadow issues include our\ncapacity for jealousy and for Envy for\naggression for greed etc etc uh we don't\nwant to acknowledge those things but\nsince when are we exempt from The Human\nCondition the wisest thing ever said\nabout the shadow came from the Latin\nplayright Terrance two Millennia ago who\nsaid uh nothing human is alien to me now\nI think that's important to recognize in\nme I carry the entire capacity of human\nnature to express itself some of those\nforms of Expressions will be acceptable\nto the society or to my psychological\nculture and some will not be um and\nthat's the shadow material and you know\nthere's the personal Shadow and there\nare group Shadows because Nations can be\npossessed by Blood Lust For example or\nor a fashion is a shadow issue where\neverybody has to look the same way and\ndress the same way and so forth you know\nthe more insecure I am as a person the\nmore likely I'm going to try to look\naround me for what are the clues so I\ncan fit in be be like others therefore\nI'll be acceptable you see that's not a\nfederal crime that's a very deep complex\nthat is left over from childhood I'm not\nhere to fit in I'm here to be who I am\nwhich at times will fit in and other\ntimes it won't but that's okay okay\nbecause I'm at least in good\nrelationships to my myself at that point\nso typically the shadow manifest as\nbeing unconscious therefore it just\nspills into the world through us a\nperfect example of Shadow issues as I\nmentioned before is parents expecting\ntheir children to grow up and have you\nknow the same kind of values that I have\nfor example same religious views marry\nsomebody that I find acceptable etc etc\nwell that's not really loving the\notherness of the other is it it's not\nreally loving the child for their own\nJourney that's them carrying some piece\nof their of their own unfinished\nbusiness secondly uh we disown the\nShadow by projecting on some you know\nthose people across the border they're\nyou know they're the carrier of they're\nthey're what's wrong with this world you\nsee I disown the shadow in myself by\nseeing it in everybody else around me\nYung actually said what often we find\ntroubling in another person is because\nthey're they're expressing something\nwithin our own unconscious\num you know as a certain itinerate Rabbi\nsaid two Millennia ago um I can see the\nspeck in your eye but miss the log in my\nown that's a perfect illustration What\nThe Shadow\nis thirdly one can get caught up in it\nthat's at times what rock concerts are\nmass events people caught up in a mob\nmentality where you lose your sense of\nindividual ego identity and become\nsubsumed into a collective mood\nand you know that could be um a hanging\nmob for example as has happened in\nhistory too many times um and it could\nbe a force for good or a force for evil\nbut again the larger the group the lower\nthe level of consciousness of the\nindividuals in that group and then\nfourthly we recognize it in\nourselves in a um speech at Yale\nUniversity in 1937 Yung said a person\nwho could look at their own shadow and\nown it he said now has large problem\nbecause they're no longer to blame\nothers for what goes wrong in their life\nthey they have to acknowledge that\nwithin themselves and he said further\nit's the single best thing you can do\nfor your Society this is not Naval\ngazing this is how you lift your\nunfinished business off of your partner\nyour children take it back yourself\nwhich is a loving thing to do and a\ncivic-minded thing to do if you look at\ncollectively\nhere so how does one\nlearn what their Shadow or Shadows well\nagain if you're married ask your partner\nsure you know who will tell you\nimmediately um what your unfinished\nbusiness may be um or your children or\nyour close friend perhaps um it shows up\nin dreams um you know Freud talked about\na young man who's disowned what the\ncontent of his dream he says well I I\ndon't you know fre said well whose dream\ndo you think that was it was your dream\nyou have to acknowledge that that was\nembodying something within you so um\nthere are many ways to recognize the\nshadow often consequences pile up and\nthen one begins to realize well the only\nconsistent person in all the uh scenes\nof this drama I call my life is is mAh\nso I have to acknowledge that that's my\nstuff and that's a very humbling thing\nthat's why I say this work is humbling\nnot not uh inflating in some way it's\nhumbling so um again shadow work is\nnever going to be popular because it\nmeans I'm taking\nresponsibility and yet what else would\nbeing human being who's responsible and\nadult like um do accept except\nresponsibility you see it's one of the\ndefinitions I would say of an adult\nperson is I I know I'm accountable for\nwhat spills in the world through me yes\nI'm responding to various things that\nhappen around me but sooner or later I\nI'm the one bringing my stories my\ncondition\nresponses and something of my shadow to\nthe mix and responding out of that now\nthat's a witch's brew at times as you\ncould imagine at the same time you\nrecognize all right but that's my\nbusiness to address because if I don't\nit just\ncontinues what I observe in the world\nand what I've experienced before is that\num certainly we all have Shadow sides um\nme everybody I mean I think that's like\nI think anyone that doesn't believe that\nis uh perhaps not of homo sapiens um you\nknow um maybe other animals have shadows\ntoo who knows um but that when Shadows\nClash it becomes very confusing because\num given what you're saying very few\npeople address their shadows and these\ndays especially there's no need to make\nthis political this is just social sure\num we see mob\nforming as you said the larger the group\nthe lower the level of\nConsciousness and then it\nbecomes even more challenging to address\none's Shadow when\na there's the perception of an attack\nmhm B that attack often times is the\nreflection of the other group Shadow and\nC people find Refuge with people who\nhave similar Shadow yes processes so it\num not to be pessimistic here but\num perhaps the answer is what you\nreferred to before is to go inward to\nthe\nself work with somebody or or um\nsomebody close to you that that has your\nbest interest in mind truly best\ninterest in mind and then um try to\nresolve that well yes and very few\npeople are willing to do that that's\nwhat polarizes societies polarizes\ngroups and and so forth it's it's\ncomforting to find like-minded people\nbut then they're both caught in the same\ncomplex there's another way of putting\nthat so ultimately whatever reality is\nit's going to wear through that and and\nreveal something that's uh going to be\npretty disconcerting to individuals who\nwho are caught in a collective\nidentification that way you know the the\nshadow comes because our human nature is\nthrust into various social situations we\ncan't help but have a shadow you know I\nwe we have to socialize a child we learn\nto use a knife and a fork and not take\nour siblings food and that sort of thing\nyou learn to look both ways for you\ncross the street there's socialization\nthat's important and yet the greater the\nsocialization the more likely there's\ngoing to be an interruption I mean think\nabout those cultures where people are\nforced to dress alike for some form of\nunity or\nConformity um um think think about where\na person might have a special gift or\ntalent but it's not appreciated in\nfamily X or Y well where does that\nnatural form of expression go it\npathologizes as depression or it comes\nout in compensatory dreams or\nprojections onto someone else or or it\nmakes the person ill you know the\nunlived life can make a person ill\nthere's a sickness under death as kard\ntalked about it you know it's it's uh\nit's that sickness where where the human\nspirit is being being repetitively\nviolated and much in our culture\nviolates our spirits and and spirit is\nnot something you will it's something\nthat that is the quickening of life's\nenergy and service to something and if\nyour family or your situation imposes\nitself upon that uh to give a quick\nexample my my own family of origin was\none in which they were by the\ncircumstances of decades ago unable to\nto attain an education my father worked\nin a factory my mother was a\nsecretary and um for them life was a\nseries of shaming\nevents and um overwhelming events and\nthe message to me both over and covert\nis don't go out there it's it's too too\nbig it's too much stay here and we'll\ntake care of each other so one of the\nfirst things I did when I was 18 was\nleft I went to college and came back for\nvacations but but I left psychologically\nat that point I something in me knew\nthat I had to have a larger life than\nthat and I say that with love and\nrespect and compassion for my parents\nthe last conversation I had with my\nmother before she died of\ncancer um her ancestor her father she'd\nnever known was from\nSweden and I'd had a book translated\ninto Swedish and I told her I thought\nthat would be something that would be\nnice for her and and she was horrified\nit's like why have you written it what\nare they saying and I thought she meant\nreviewers at first and I realize that's\nthe voice I heard in childhood she was\nsaying you shouldn't be out there now\npeople are going to attack you this will\ndraw attention to you you see and her\nintention was protective in her last\ndays actually before she died she was\nmore afraid of what people thought than\nwhether her son was living his journey\nor not and I say this with grief for\nher and and that was the message of\nchildhood you know it's too much out\nthere and yet something inside quickened\nand said well you need to go where those\nairplanes are going you need to go see\nthe ocean for yourself um you need to\ntry to live in a foreign country and see\nwhat that's like um was I was that easy\nno it was doubly hard because of the\nmessages I had but it was just necessary\nsooner or later again the appointment\nwith your life do you keep it or you not\nkeep the appointment so that was the\nfirst meeting of the appointment was to\nto leave home and start the journey you\nknow in terms of the the archetype of\nthe of the journey first is the\ndeparture and then you have the\ninitiatory experiences which can knock\nyou down and then the question is do you\nget up and go to the next one\nand sooner or later something begins to\nchange inside and you begin to feel that\nthis is this is the journey that's right\nfor me it's very moving to hear because\nI you know we hear with that we become\nour parents M and yet I've never\nbelieved that um I believe that um for\nwhatever reasons inside us that we\neither adopt their traits unconsciously\nor consciously or we resist them 180° in\nthe other direction MH there doesn't\nseem to be a 90° response that's as as\nyour example beautifully illustrates\nthat there's something in the brain and\nin the human psyche that either says\nyeah okay like that's just the way life\nis um For Better or\nWorse um or says\nno and you know I feel I'm 48 years old\nso I'm still learning to be a full adult\num um I like to think there's some\nneuroplasticity left science tells us\nthere's neuroplasticity throughout the\nlifespan so and I do believe that um but\nI feel like so much of being an adult\nperhaps just being a human being is\nabout learning to stand one's ground and\nsay no no no no no that's me and this is\nwhat's right for me and you're wrong\ncrazy or just different and we agree to\ndisag agree and then there's the other\nhalf of being an adult which is saying\noh\ngoodness you might be right maybe you\nare right okay you're right I screwed up\nor\nI need to think at least think about\nthis differently and and the hard work\nof being a human I think is\nknowing when you are dealing with\nincoming messages that are real\nthey could be from a healthy Source or\nan unhealthy Source it's complicated\nthis is why I mentioned this thing about\nthe internet and social media in\nparticular earlier I do believe it's\nborderline I think if you were to remove\nthe names and the um faces and you would\njust put that into a a a script you'd\nsay this is a dialogue coming from a\nborderline person weaving back and forth\nacross the line literally of healthy and\npsychotic and so as a human especially\nnowadays it's complicated um we don't\njust live in little Villages where we go\nokay well that person tends to kind of\nyou know spin off and that person seems\nvery grounded but occasionally makes\nmistakes too you know um and so I feel\nlike so much of the work of being a I\nsaid an adult but I I'm going to replace\nthat with just a human is trying to know\nthyself right as the Oracle said and own\nthyself and and report that into the\nworld but also to be semi-permeable and\nin a way that's functional is such hard\nwork because in both\ncases the adoption of what we were told\nand what was ingrained in us and is\nunconscious so that we just live out the\nscript of our parents or where we say no\nI'm I'm going to leave this little town\nor I'm not going to live life or\nrelationships that way at all I'm going\nto do it this other completely different\nway maybe unconventional way both have\nan element of reactivity in them and cly\nboth have an element of um kind of\nuh um there's like a there's a Vigor\nbehind it sure no your your point is\nvery well taken and and appropriate\nbecause it is a paradox first of\nall in the Eden Project a book I wrote\non relationship and subtitled the search\nfor the magical leather there is inside\nof us this infantile and understandable\ndesire to find the right person who's\ngoing to make our life work for us who's\ngoing to take care of us meet our needs\nread our minds etc etc you see and the\nother person has that going on in them\nso they project that on to us you wonder\nwhy relationships get so complexed you\nsee but the great gift of relationship\nif you can tolerate it is the otherness\nof the other produces the dialectic\nproduces the the enlargement that comes\nfrom encountering the other I've learned\nso much from my my wife and I believe\nshe's learned a few things from me uh\nour ongoing dialogue because we're both\nsimilar and very different at the same\ntime is one that has at times been\nconflictual naturally but most the time\nis a pattern of growth because we we are\nallowed to bring in that other\nperspective and see the same reality my\nmy my wife has taught me to see some\nthings that I wouldn't have seen before\nbecause she's has an artist Eye on the\nother hand there are places where you\nhave to come up as you said against what\nis Central and critical to your own\nwell-being or your own integrity and\nthen you have to stand for that and the\nwisdom to know which is which at any\ngiven time is is not in bred it's it's\none of those times where we have to find\nthat balancing point between legitimate\ndialogue and compromise and sacrifice in\na relationship there's a place for\nsacrifice but at the same time there's a\nplace where you have to say all right\nbut I also so have to separate myself\nhere and and stand for this on the other\nside of that and you know it takes a\nsolomonic wisdom to know always what's\nright but over time I think one can get\na sense of of what that's about so you\nknow again that's why we we have to\nindividuate as individuals by definition\nbut also in\nrelationship because it's the otherness\nof the others that pulls us out of that\nself-referential system otherwise we get\ncaught you know in a circular dialogue\namong our complexes for example as y\nsaid it's important to go to the\nMountaintop to meditate but if you stay\nup there too long you'll be talking to\nghosts you know your your complexes will\nbe caught in this this looping cycle and\nyou need the other to pull you out of\nthat into the presence of the other and\nit's out of that that the third\ncomes um Joseph camel made an important\ndistinction once he said about committed\nrelationship he said if you're\nconstantly sacrificing to the\nother um you'll grow\nresentful but if you're sacrificing to\nthe project the two of you've launched\nto together as a friendship or a\nmarriage or whatever form it takes you\ncan do that in a very constructive way\nyou're fed by that because you're you're\nyou're mutually committed to the project\nthat this relationship\nrepresents and that's an important\ndistinction I\nthink yeah given that 50% or more of\nmarriages seem to end in divorce these\ndays I think that statistic still holds\num do you think that can be largely\nattributed to uh people not arriving to\nthose relationships with the mindset you\njust described people not arriving to\nthose relationships having um a deep\nenough understanding of themselves prior\nto that or um something else I think all\nof the above um first of all young\npeople tend to marry and make babies\nunderstandably um um and then 20 years\nlater in some way they're a different\nperson and it's very hard for the\npremises that brought them together to\nstill obtain in a Developmental and\nhonest way you know many years\nlater when you reach that point then\nthere is a time for renegotiation or if\nneed be unfortunately the dissolution of\nthat\nrelationship um because I had a\ncolleague in New Jersey years ago who\nworked exclusively with the couples and\nshe she talked about starter marriages\nand she said I would never say that\npublicly because that sounded too\npessimistic but she said if you're lucky\nyour starter marriage will be a good one\nthat will evolve and so forth but for\nmost people that which brought them\ntogether was running from their parents\nor replicating their parents'\nrelationships or uh their their\ninsecurity about themselves therefore\nthey bonded with someone else who was\ngoing to take care of that for them\nwhatever it was\nit's been outlived their their own\nnatural development their life\ncircumstances have changed and then it\nbrings about you know the necessity of\nsome very difficult decisions so you\nknow marriage marriage is an institution\nwith the best of\nintentions that is sorely tested over\ntime and you know sometimes it'll\nsurvive the test in I I would not\nautomatically applaud if someone's been\nmarried 50 or 60 years I would ask what\nhas happened to the soul of that person\nin that\nrelationship has it grown has it\ndeveloped did did they mutually support\neach other's growth and development or\ndid something get stuck at that point\nand um our our early family of origin\nDynamics still dominating that\nrelationship and from the outside we\nusually don't know the answer to that\nquestion but inside you'd have to say\nwhat what has happened to this person\nand the same is true with parenting you\nknow parenting is very very difficult\nbecause we'd like to think we know\nwhat's right for our own child but then\nthey have to spend a good part of their\nlife trying to get away from us in some\nway as we did ourselves you see and then\nyou if you remember that then you're a\nlittle more likely to say you know I\nreally don't know what's going on here\nbut I have to pay more attention to what\nI think is wanting expression through my\nchild and and support that rather than\nassuming that they're going to grow up\nand replicate our lives and our values\nas I've said\nbefore given the number of people who do\ndeep introspective work either by\nthemselves or with a trained\nprofessional it's perhaps should\nsurprise us that 50% of marriages do\nsurvive yeah in a in a way yes and and\nthose that survive are not necessarily\ngood marriages in the sense in which the\nperson is growing and developing they\nmay be stuck they may be afraid of the\nAlternatives they may be Bound by\neconomics for example or or cultural\nforms so again from outside you don't\nknow what's happening inside the soul of\nthat individual and it's very important\nfor us to not judge them for that\nreason earlier you you described the the\npainful work sometimes painful work of\nreally addressing what one wants and\nreally getting in touch with one's Soul\npsyche um and how Society or we think\nSociety might not approve of that and\nyet when I think about popular\nculture um often times it's the people\nthat seem to be living in their own\ntruth that are most celebrated that's\ntrue like there's something about the\nthe crowd I've shifted from Mob to crowd\nhere to make it sound more benevolent\nbut but it's still a mob that cheers on\nthe person who really seems to be in\ntheir we say full expression or living\nin their truth but who just comes out\nand says like yeah I don't I don't\nreally care what they're saying about me\nor what people think I know me I know my\nown goodness my own intention my own um\nMission and the people close to me do\nhopefully they have people close to them\nand we say yeah like go it's inspiring\nyes that's why I said earlier many of\nthe people in history that we would\nadmire had difficult lives but we admire\nthem because they stuck to some value\nthat was Central to who they were and\nthey lived that maybe at Great cost but\nthey live that through whatever\nsuffering they had to to trans to\nexperience um again from outside we\ndon't know do we when we see some\ncultural figure out there uh may maybe\nthey're manipulative may maybe they're\ncaught in a complex of some kind we\ndon't know from outside you you have to\nsay I mean one of the Shadow issues how\noften people will live through a\ncelebrity or live through a pop figure\nin some way maybe imitate that person uh\nagain for a child that's natural and\nnormal on the other hand uh sooner or\nlater you have to say but my journey is\na different\nJourney maybe they're living there is\nbeen in my living mind and I don't mean\nthis in any grandiose way I don't mean\nthat they have to go out and become\nsomething that's noted in the society\nbut to live in accord with something\nthat is wishing its its U expression\nthrough us that's why I said the final\nquestion in life is is what is wanting\nto live in this world through me rather\nthan what do I want or what do my\ncomplexes want because they're noisy\nchatterers in there you know I had a a\ndear friend from another state right to\nme just yesterday and um he's in\nsemi-retirement now and he's been\ndealing with some health issues and uh\nhe said now that I'm not distracted I\nhave time to work on all the Goblins of\nthe past that I left behind and he's an\nanalyst so it's not like we get rid of\nthese things they're lifelong this is\nwhy Yung said we can't solve these\nthings but we can outgrow them there's a\nbig difference you know you become\nlarger than what happened to you for\nexample you become larger than that\nvoice inside of you that says you can do\nthis but you can't do\nthat um and over time you know something\ninside of you is wishing that growth and\npushing that and again pathologizes when\nthat's blocked so so people can be doing\nall the right things is defined by their\nvalues and their\nenvironment and it violates something\ninside that's why we can be quote\nsuccessful and Achieve things and it\nstill feels empty there's no there there\nyou know you get to the top of the\nladder and you realize there's no there\nthere and that happens so often in our\nculture um I I remember one of the um\nfiscal figures in the late 20th century\nwho had a personal Fortune of $400\nmillion and he was asked what was his\nphilosophy of life and he said well the\nend of life the person with the biggest\npile wins and I remember thinking how\ninfantile is that this was a smart\nman and Elder Statesman in his field\nultimately went to prison because of\nsome things um\nbut that's the philosophy of the sandbox\nI have the biggest pile of sand I've won\nno you haven't won your\ndebt and it's a pile of sand what are\nyou talking about and yet this is what\ndrove the man's life and obviously drove\nhim across enough lines that it got him\ninto legal troubles sooner or later and\nagain I say that without judgment I'm\njust saying here is an example of a very\nachieved person who's been living an\ninfantile philosophy and as such\nsomething else causes him to pay greatly\nfor that yeah I certainly can say that\num\ndespite having pursued work with a lot\nof vigor and career that without\nquestion\nfriendships and relationships are the\nmost important thing there's just no\nquestion right the uh especially when\nthings get hard that's right you know I\nI actually I actually have a list in\nthis very book I won't flip to it now of\nthe people that I'm just really blessed\nto call close friends like real friends\nthat you can count on and to me it and\nI've always in my sister I have an older\nsister and she always said you've always\nbeen a pack animal I've always had uh U\nbig groups of of biggish groups of\nfriends and it's something I've invested\nin heavily sometimes to the expense of\nother things um including work and other\nrelationships but um but the notion that\num yeah the material things or that the\nuh opinions of strangers would somehow\nfill us that to me is like the most\nforeign concept sure like that's that's\nthe the most foreign concept but um but\nclearly some people operate on those\nmetrics that's like of course and my\nguess is that they have a a um a a\nreward\nHorizon that is you know tacked to\nwhatever it is the algorithms are that\nget them that thing and so it must feed\nsome reward mechanism that hasn't\ndistracted enough like locked into this\none mode of time perception you know\njust hit the mile Mark hit the mile Mark\nhit the mile Mark so that they're not\naware but when you take somebody like\nthat who's been doing that for a\nlifetime and you say wait\nyou know you're on this track going\naround and around and AC crewing\ntrophies but actually that track doesn't\ngo anywhere doesn't lead you into the\nworld that's right my guess is that they\nthey just they've been doing it so long\nthat they're like an animal that's just\nbeen you know digging a trench and in\nits zo confined sure cage which is\nsomething I'm finding with a lot of the\nmen that I see uh I happen to see right\nnow in my practice uh several men\nbetween UH 60 and8 80 and uh one\n82 um and of course they've been\nconditioned to work and then suddenly\nyou know on Monday morning you have to\nstop and think who you are you get up\nand you go to work and you do what\nyou've done all these years and then\nsuddenly you don't do that what are you\ngoing to do you say well I'm going to go\nplay golf every day well okay go do that\nbut typically within three or four\nmonths the depression comes and they'll\nthink about well I need to get back into\ndoing this or get doing that you\nsee so often we find people defined by\nexactly that kind of mentality I've\nfinished the first lap so what do I do\nrun another lap and run another lap and\nyou realize you keep coming back to the\nsame starting point that's why I say\nit's not what you do it's what it's in\nservice to inside that makes a\ndifference so is that person being\nsuccessful by external standards yes\nwhatever that means does that mean that\ntheir psyche is going to cooperate and\ngive them that genuine sense of s\nsatisfaction in something no it won't\nit's autonomous it's not going to get\nco-opted into that and soon or later you\nknow chickens come home to roast and\nthen you have a depression as I\nexperienced and and or you you find your\nrelationships are in tatters all around\nyou so sooner or later I mean no\nRevelation on my part nature will\nExpress itself and if uh if we live long\nenough and then everything that we've\npushed underground is be is going to be\ncoming\nup you mentioned men in particular so\nnow it probably be a good time to um ask\nabout men in particular you wrote Under\nSaturn Shadow which is how I initially\nlearned about your work and then I\nlisten to some of your lectures online\nI'm still in the process of reading your\num other books but um let's talk\nabout archetypes\nstereotypes of men and women um with the\nintention of course of um better\nunderstanding what's real as opposed to\nwhat's\nstereotype um so in the um let's call it\nthe 1930s 40s 50s 60s view of men in the\nUnited States and elsewhere there was\nthis notion of kind of like the\nstoic uh and work and um uh Duty and um\nand to some extent a fair amount of\nMystique\nright like it wasn't really because with\num fewer words uh we have less awareness\nat least of what people are saying who\nknows what they're thinking whether\ndon't they talk a lot or not um but\nthere was this idea of of the um the\nmale as somebody who did\nstuff maybe thought about\nit but didn't really talk about it much\num nowadays things have\nchanged um this is born out in the\nstatistics on College campuses about how\nmany people seek therapy um if they have\nan issue it's gone from like 15% to 85\nplus% at least roughly in the statistics\nI've seen so um but in terms of males\nand their sense of Duty and how they're\nsupposed to be in the world um I would\nthink just the way I just laid out the\nlittle you know by all admittance like\njust very Antiquated now view of\nmaleness um\nthat they would be thinking a lot about\nwhat's going on it would meet some of\nthe daily practices that you talked\nabout earlier um that there would be\nreflection that there would be um\nConsciousness there would be um uh an\nunderstanding of one's Shadow or if one\nwere to add in the the other stereotype\nthat went with it that they drink a lot\nright that was very much I'll remember\nmy first I went to graduate school first\nat Berkeley before I shifted to a\ndifferent place um and I was told when I\ngot there that it used to be that the\nfaculty and graduate students of which\nat that time in the 1970s and 60s was\nmostly male mostly now that's changed\nfortunately right that they would meet\nevery day after work to drink and then\nstagger home to their Partners every day\nand I was shocked like are you kidding\nme I was like no every single day so you\nknow the the idea here is that um that\nwas the old view now things are very\ndifferent but what about the work\nof men men and boys to try and\nunderstand their own psyche better what\nwhat is the uh what are the things that\nare specific to them that you've talked\nabout and then we'll turn to women and\nthen uh we'll we'll do our best to\nbridge The Divide in a\nconversation well um Ju Just to go back\nto our our earlier conversation for a\nmoment you know why would those men have\nto drink every day and the answer is\nbecause there was some deep pain that\nthey had to\nanesthetize of which they were by and\nlarge unaware or presumably they would\nhave the opportunity to address whatever\nthat was um you know and I'll come back\nto that in a moment I've been asked\noften to speak about men by women's\ngroups and by the way men's groups have\nnever asked me to talk about women right\nis that right that's right you know\nindividuals such as yourself but it's\nit's mostly women's groups have asked me\ntalk about those strange creatures\ncalled men and I say imagine these three\nthings first of all that you cut away\nall your close friends the women that\nyou share your worries about your\nmarriage with about your children about\nyour body your love life or lack thereof\nyou know those people are gone forever\nthere's no one you can share that with\nsecondly um you have to sever your link\nto whatever your guiding Source may be\nyou call it your instinct or your\nintuition whatever it is that's that's\ncut off it's not acceptable and thirdly\nyour value as a human being will be\ndefined by your meeting abstract\nstandards of productivity as defined by\ntotal strangers in your culture and\nsooner or later no matter how much you\nwin today you'll wind up a loser and the\nthing is you hold that off as long as\nyou can so keep running all right and\nwomen hear that and they think well\nthat's horrible that's horrible how\nlonely that would be how isolating that\nwould be and of course it is it's self\narranging you know my my poor father was\npulled out of the e8th grade sent to to\nwork in the factory worked all of his\nlife in that factory and and by the\nstandards of his day he was a good man\nhe supported his family he didn't run\naway he he accept the\nresponsibility but I also know he didn't\nlive his own soul I know that and I had\nClues here and there and I even saw that\nas a\nchild um and and so when I started to\nreflect on\nmen I I realized I had my own\ninhibitions about that and I was\nfortunately enough as a therapist I\nwould say all right what would you say\nto someone who expressed these\ninhibitions I would say all right there\nthere's some some fears here that you're\ndefending yourself against what's that\nabout so I thought and then I had a\nvoice in me that said but these are\nsecret you don't talk about it then I\nthought well that's my duty isn't it I\nhave to bring some of those things up\nand so that's what led to the writing of\nthe book under Sater Shadow and um I\nsuggested a number of those Secrets One\nis men's lives are much as much governed\nby role expectations as women's lives\nare less so today but in the past they\nwere Ironclad right um and they the net\neffect of those roles was self-\narranging you know you are your function\nyou are your\nduties um men's lives are governed by\nfear-based responses\nand there's a certain level of\ncompetitiveness that is essential to to\nmen's culture women learn through the\nyears probably out of necessity to\ncooperate and support each other um and\nand they can get through difficult\nthings by doing that for for men it's\nyou're always having to\ndemonstrate your competency in one area\nor another and the one thing you don't\nwant to do is be a loser you see it's a\nzero sum game winners and losers and um\nultimately there's a deep deep uh\nlonging for well there's a fear of the\nfeminine socalled that can include the\nfeminine within hence men's estranging\nthemselves from themselves I had a\nclient many years ago who was sent into\ntherapy by his wife saying you know\neither you go to therapy or I'm out of\nhere so he was there very reluctantly\nand he walked in and he saw a box of uh\ntissue there a Kleenex box and he he\njust kind of sniffed at that without\nsaying anything and I knew exactly what\nhe was saying but I acted like I didn't\nand he thought I'd missed the clue and\nso he pointed the box and sniffed again\nand I I said what what's this about and\nhe said well you had a woman in here\nbefore don't you I'm not going to be\nneeding\nthat and I said you know every man has a\na lake of Tears inside of himself and a\nmountain of anger in there and I said\nsooner or later and he said no no we\nhave other better ways of dealing with\nthat and I thought well our prognosis is\nnot very good here\nhe he left after about five sessions\nbecause it was just going to ask more\nthan he was capable of so there's a fear\nof the feminist like I have to be so\nmuch in my masculine mode of\ncombativeness or competitiveness or\nexpression of Competency I can't afford\nanything that one would\nundo my my shaky hold on that\nwheresoever you see Macho Behavior you\nsee fear-based overcompensation is what\nit amounts to right you know saber\nraveling rattling is is always a\nfear-based\nresponse and and underneath there is a\nvery deep longing you know for the wise\nfather for for the the person you could\nsee some modeling from who would teach\nyou something who would share with you\nwisdom he's learned along the way and so\nyou know the condition of modern men and\nthings have changed a great deal and I\nthink partly stirred by the um\nrevolution in in in the history of women\nyou know and and their courage in\naddressing these stereotypes about what\na woman is and what she's supposed to do\nwith her life um required men to start\nlooking at themselves as well so women\nhave done us a great favor not always\nrecognized by men but um you know in\nboth cases you have to say all right the\nmessage you have from family of origin\nand culture may or may not work for you\nbut you're here to in a certain way\ndeconstruct you know those expectations\nand and find your own path you\nsee uh the Spanish analist Irene Deo not\nlong to cease now talked about the\ndifference between focused awareness and\ndiffuse awareness and I think rather\nthan talk about gender which is a social\nconstruct coming out of this culture or\nthis culture or this culture talk about\nthose are two different modes of\norientation to the world and we need\nboth we need focused awareness that's\ngold directed behavior that is\nhistorically associated with the\nmasculine and we also need this\nawareness of context and of\nrelationship so this focused awareness\nwithout relatedness leads to sterility\nand isolation and on the other hand too\ndiffuse without a sense of directed and\npurposeful Behavior you know means that\none is just sort of fumbling one's way\nthrough life too I've always said to\nwomen in therapy you know to be a man is\nin a sense your requirement is to know\nwhat you want and to do it but you have\nto do that too in what y called the\nAnimus that is to say the so-called\ninner masculine or the inner focused\nawareness and that gold directed\nbehavior is what moves your life forward\nin a purposeful way but for men it's\nit's about becoming aware of again\ncontext and\nrelatedness what happens if I have the\nbiggest pile of sand at at the end of my\nlife well you know obviously you can't\ntake it with you but in the end it's\nonly sand money is only money what was\nyour life about that's the\nquestion women have to ask that men have\nto ask that and sometimes the culture is\nsupportive in that process sometimes\nit's opposed to that and and then that's\nwhen you have to engage in a fight men\nand women have a you know a common\nsummons here and they can be very\nsupportive of each other as well as you\nknow celebrate their\ndifferences and recognize um you know as\nmen are beginning to recognize if you\ndon't address what's going on inside of\nyou you're you're going to be uh simply\na creature of adaptation and you're\ngoing to lose your way sooner or later\num when I came back from my training in\nZurich in the\n70s um I would say my practice was 90%\nwomen and 10% men today it's the reverse\n90% men I don't put out a shangle and\nsay I see men or women I I see both but\nuh I think again it's the change is in\nmen now they they\nrecognize they're lost in some way the\nold masculine definitions are no longer\napplicable you know a lot of this\nhappened with the Industrial Revolution\nwhere Fathers and Sons work together in\nthe same trait if you were a Tanner you\ntanned you know if you were a carpenter\nyou you built houses if if you were a\nShepherd you you know worked with a\nsheep and so forth um and you sort of\nlearn who you are from your rubbing\nshoulders with the father well well\ntoday men go away to the factory or go\naway to the office and Sons are at home\nwith their mothers you know and they're\nfemale School teachers and so forth and\nso there's again this deep hunger for\nthe initiatory Father the the the the\nsupportive father in traditional\ncultures where there were rights of\nPassage they recognized the importance\nof separating the boy at puberty in a\nsimpler culture yes but at puberty it\nwasn't initiated by the personal father\nor relatives it was by the elders in the\ntribe often wearing masks or painted\nfaces because they were archetypal\nforces they were not the neighbor down\nthe street it was like you're in the\nhands of the Gods now and they require\nyou to leave home and we're going to\nteach you things but we're also going to\nbring about some forms of isolation and\nsuffering for you so begin to realize\nthat you have within you the resources\nto undertake this journey what we have\nnow is is a whole culture of uninitiated\nmales who haven't left home\npsychologically speaking you know in the\npast they were simply governed by\nmasculine roles and now as those of\ndissolved for many men um there there's\nvery little sense of well what does it\nmean to be a man what am I supposed to\ndo as as a man and the answer basically\nis go live your life find find your path\nfind the courage and resolve and\nresources to to sustain that over time\nbut you know how to do that is there's\nno model for that it's it's you have to\nsort of find that your yourself you see\nand that's what brings people into\ntherapy at times and it's interesting\nthat I have right now this collection\nand it's consonant with my own stage of\nLife Journey too of of I only have one\nman under 50 and all the others are\ninterested in how you deal with aging\nand mortality for a good reason and\nthey're also dealing with how do I\nDefine myself other than my\nwork and and that's where the unlived\nlife often is coming back back in a very\nuseful way all right although there are\nsome things that have left and not\ncoming back in terms of the changes in\nthe body and that sort of thing but\nbasically\nnow is the time to address this\nemotional developmental spiritual life\nthat is to say do you have any concept\nof a story that's larger than the\nstories of your complexes you see\ndoesn't mean one has to be part of a\nreligious group it means that you have\nto question what quickens the spirit in\nme what stirs me inside what touches me\nwhere do I encounter the numinous and\nthe the word numinous means there's\nsomething there that that causes this\nreaction within me so if you and I walk\ninto an art museum let's say and you're\ntouched by a particular painting and and\nfrightened by it or moved to Tears by it\nor whatever and the other person walks\nby and is indifferent which is a right\nwell it's not right or wrong it's this\nhere it correlates with something in\nhere that's what caused that resonance\nand that resonance is your engagement\nwith something numinous for you you\ndon't have to know it or explain or\nwhatever but you have to Value it and\nask what is it that was touched in me\nand if it doesn't speak to me um Duty or\nconvention or expectations insufficient\nto make it happen we can't will these\nthings to be\nnuminous numinosity is something that's\ndefined by one soul and not by the\ncollective that's for sure and women and\nmen in time I think will find that they\nhave very similar goals in their life\nand that's how to balance my journey\nwith the legitimate commitments of\nrelationship on the other side and that\nthat's why we have that wonderful word\nsacrifice you know not surrender\nsacrifice is fer to Sacred sacrificer to\nmake sacred if you're sacrificing on\nbehalf of a value that is right for you\nand for your project together then\nyou're both served by that on the other\nhand and you don't sacrifice the Journey\nof the individual Spirit too and again\nit's about balancing that as best one\ncan and there's very little in our\nculture that rewards that but then the\nprice is again the symptomatology that\ncomes from to the surface and from a\npsychodynamic standpoint we don't say\nwell how quickly to get rid of the\nsymptoms we say why if they\ncome what are they asking of me that's\nwhy as I I said my first question in\ntherapy was how quickly did I get rid of\nthis depression get back on the road you\nknow the careerism road right and and I\ncame in time to realize it was my psyche\nsaying you're on the wrong path fella\nyou don't know it's not so much that\nit's wrong it's just not right for you\nthere's a big difference here and you're\ngoing to have to find a different kind\nof conversation in your life and so\nforth and during my training I was\nobliged to you know do my um clinical\nexperience I was working in a\npsychiatric Hospital in uh New\nJersey and sometimes I was shuttling\nback and forth the same day between the\npsychiatric hospital a locked word in\nthe in the University campus and I came\nto realize the conversation in the\nhospital was more real somehow it was\nmore more about things that\nmattered and that's what began to to you\nknow further my resolve to move from\nAcademia to being a a therapist you know\nworking therapist and and and so forth\nso it it the point is I need to add this\nmy way of responding\nto the family of origin and social\ncontext stuff was to retreat into the\nlife of the mind I didn't realize that's\nwhat I was doing at the\ntime that's why the psyche had to reach\nup and Pull Me\nUnder And um then I came to realize that\nthe fears that I had in childhood were\nthe ones I had to face at midlife the\ndifference being I was bringing the\nadults capacity to the table that was\nnot present to the child\nso quick example in my first week\nworking in the psychiatric hospital I\nwas signed to a kind of grizzled old\nex-military guy who was the my mentor\nand without asking me he took me into an\nautopsy it was his you know let's\ninitiate the new kid kind of thing you\nknow well I realized it was a test so I\nstayed cool and so forth all the while\nI'm seeing this human body you know cut\nup and so forth in a radical\nway and and I realized all that I had\nfled in childhood was right there on the\ntable before me and it continued to\nperseverate in my dreams and so forth\nand I I was back in Zurich in my own\nanalysis and I talked about this and my\nanalyst said quite rightly he said when\nyou've dealt with your fears the fears\nof others will not be so threatening to\nyou cu the the closed W I was in was at\ntimes violent and so forth and was not a\npleasant situation but I could feel my\nown sense of purpose and gravitas in\nthat situation after that so it's like\nyou can run but you can't hide sooner or\nlater what you've avoided will show up\nin your behaviors or your blockage in\nyour behaviors so it doesn't go away it\ngoes\nsomewhere I'd like to just hover a bit\non this idea that um you know on the one\nhand our work is to understand ourselves\nand what really feeds our\nsoul um and to try and live that forward\nas much as possible in a benevolent way\none would hope and on the other hand\nanytime we are in the relational aspects\nof life in particular romantic\nrelationship as we sort of framed it\nhere yes um because I think with\nfriendships\nand work relationships oftentimes it can\nalign with the self in a different way\num and it's our work to try and as you\nsaid sacrifice to to sacrifice one for\nthe other one for the other in a way\nthat over time allows both to not just\npersist but grow and I'm also thinking\nabout what you said earlier which was\nyou know we should be cautious about\nimmediately applauding the 50-year\nmarriage because often times there's a a\nsoul death in one or both people um and\nthat we don't want to celebrate that and\nyet there's something pretty impressive\nabout a 50-year marriage as as a um if\nfor no other reason as an endurance\nevent but we have to be cautious about\nrewarding endurance events like that\nbecause in as much as they sound to be\nabout love I mean there's also the\nendurance event of the person that was a\nstock broker for 50 years and got to the\nend and then walked out of the stock\nexchange or stepped out from behind the\ncomputer monitor and went\noh wow I missed a lot that's right so um\nthere's no handbook for this of you know\nyou spend 15 minutes here and 30 minutes\nthere ratio of 2 to one children absorb\nenergy and when there health or other\nissues in a relationship\nthen then you know energy goes you know\nas well um\nso what's the you know what's how does\none guide the rudder I mean uh does it\nrequire third- Party Support I mean I\nmean I've often thought this that\nbecause we evolved presumably in small\nvillages where there was support that at\ncloser proximity than perhaps we have\nnow um people that know both individuals\nand have the best uh uh in mind for both\num and for the collective I mean is\nthere the idea that like every romantic\ncouple should have a third- party\ntrained counselor to guide them seems\nlike not a bad idea although I think\npeople are pretty resistant to that and\nof course it takes resources which is\nalways an issue sure sure well there's\nnothing wrong with having the third\nparty conversation from time to time\nthat's for sure we have to remember that\nwhat we call therapy is a relatively\nmodern invention um how was that\naddressed before you're right at the\nVillage level uh when people were living\nin um vit vitalized mythological systems\nthey had a sense of relatedness to the\nCosmos first of all who are the gods whe\nwhether do we go when we die what's this\nlife about in other words every tribe\nhad its\nstory secondly what is our relationship\nto Nature and to live in harmony with\nthat nature as opposed to violating it\nrepeatingly for our own\npurposes thirdly who to whom do I belong\nwho is my tribe who are my people and is\nthat a life serving or a life supressing\nexperience and fourthly is the mystery\nof individual journey by what lights do\nI conduct my journey and so forth and of\ncourse those mythological systems were\nnot particularly interested in the\ndevelopment of the individual but\nthey're certainly about the individual\nbeing subsumed into the the tribal\nexperience at least you have a sense of\nbelonging erode that and people fall out\nof that into the abyss of the self as it\nwere um you put it this way he said you\nknow PE people walked off the medieval\nCathedral into the abyss of the self in\none of his letters you see and it became\na cultural contrivance with the best of\nintention to help people find their path\nand deal with whatever their psyche's\nreaction to you know again typically not\nalways but typically what brings people\nto therapy is that their belief system\nor their conventional practices are no\nlonger working for them I had a client\nfrom Houston once who said in his AA\ngroup their slogan was this isn't\nworking for me but I do it very well\nthat pretty much um summarizes the first\nstep of going into 12st step is that\nrecognition that's right and then uh you\nknow 12st step of course provides so\nmuch more but applicable to all of us\nyou know our our our practices sooner or\nlater will often because they're driven\nby these stories that we carry INTC\npsychically uh they don't work for us\nbut we've learned to do them with\ncertain facility and so forth and that's\nwhen the discrepancy becomes so\ndifficult then one has to to face the\nyou know the the fire so to speak then\nwhat matters is how am I to conduct my\nlife in the face of these circumstances\nwhich I'm not able to solve in the old\nway and that's the adventure and that's\nthe challenge and at the same time it's\nintim\nto to many people understandably so\nsooner or later again one has to say is\nthis your life or is it someone\nelse's most people are not living their\nlife sadly they're living reactively\nthey're living whatever the stories were\nand I put stories not in the sense that\nthey're so conscious as such as they\nare representing whatever message we\ninternalized and produced a splinter\nnarrative again when triggered it has\nthe power to to govern our behaviors\nit's why again you start with your own\npatterns and say where did this come\nfrom I wasn't born with it pattern is\nsomething that is replicating itself as\na result of this story spilling into the\nworld so you know what what I learned in\nmy own life was I had put so much of my\nemotional distress up in the world of\nthe life of the mind which was rich inv\nvaluable I don't repudiate that but it\nwas too\none-sided and what I had to do was come\nback and face what was on the operating\ntable in that Psychiatric Hospital the\nworld of repressed emotion fears etc etc\nit's like both are true now see if you\ncan honor both of them and when you do\nsomething grows and develops within you\nto respond to that in a new\nway so we've been covering a lot of\nhuman universals and things that\neverybody should think about and address\nwe talked a bit about things more or\nless specific to men um what about women\nwhat what are some of the um unique\npsychic challenges that um that they\nface and need to address in specific\nways sure well first of all each woman\nhas to examine what was the message\ngiven her by her family by her mother\nher family extended family expectations\nand role models and cultural setting and\nso forth and say is is this something\nthat supports my personal growth and\ndevelopment or not I mean that's a kind\nof inventory men have to ask that same\nquestion as\nwell um we we have to acknowledge that\nbiological differences suggest if you're\na woman you're the one who's going to be\ncarrying that baby and still in our\nculture the major responsibility for it\nwhile shared by father and mother\nhopefully still is something you have to\nattend and many women are trying to have\nit both ways as we know the the career\ndevelopment and and being a parent at\nthe same time I saw a survey some years\nago that um a large number of women\nExecutives all at M mbas and had all\nachieved you know like vice president\nstatus or something in their\ncorporation when at asked around age 50\nwould you do this all\nagain almost 100% said no it cost too\nmuch from me it cost me too much they\nfelt something else was missing they\nthey felt friendship was missing they\nfelt intimacy was missing in many cases\nthey felt parenting was missing or it\nhad gotten short shrift you see um as as\nmen often face when they look at\nretirement they you know the old saying\nyou on your deathbed you say GE I wish I\nspent more time with the office you know\nit's like I wish I'd done this or that I\nknow a few scientists who to this day\nsay that they plan to die in their\noffice it's always a sad thing for me to\nhear this yeah I also know their\nchildren in many cases and that's uhh\nabout four fifths of the time is not a\ngood picture that's right yeah and uh\nagain not all right this four fifths but\num because other colleagues are\nspectacular parents but I grew up with\nthe children of a lot of academics and a\nlot of times it ain't the pretty picture\nthat's right so I I think that um\nanother thing that men in our time\nreally need to learn is if you're in a\nrelationship part of your role is\nsupporting the growth and development of\nyour partner and the more insecure the\nman the more threatened he will be by\nthat because she might go off in some\nother direction you see um and that\nmeans sharing household duties and\nsharing child care and so forth forth\nwhich you do to the best of your ability\nhaving a child and having two careers\nrequires an enormous amount of juggling\nas we as we all know but you can do it\nin good faith with the best of\nintentions if not resentment builds and\none-sidedness build so I I think for for\nwomen they still need a partner that\nwill buy into the notion of genuine\nreciprocity in our responsibility to\neach other and to our our work together\nwhich includes child\nrearing uh without which women are\nunduly burdened you see unfairly\nburdened and I don't think we've solved\nthat one yet I think that's still\nopen-ended in the in the culture at this\npoint on the other hand it's it's\nstunning to see women grab hold of the\nopportunities available now uh I'm\nliving in a retirement community as of a\nyear ago and so many of the women that\nI've had din with my my wife and I have\ndinner with various people have said\nwell when I was at this stage women were\nnot allowed to do this one woman was a\nscientist and she said I just wasn't\nrecognized in the physics World until\nlike late in my life and you forget how\nrecently that was the case I mean that\nwas that was a deep violation of the\nhuman Spirit Well it was routine and so\nmany of the women that I see there who\nare going to be over 70 most of them are\nover\n80 live lived in a world that was not\nunlike a segregated world you know just\nas you know I grew up where segregation\nwas practiced by half of this country\nit's not so long ago somewhat hard to\nFathom um how much things have changed\nand yet also how much things persist\nthat's right that's right well and you\nknow the 60s happened and what this what\nhappened to the 60s is a a a kind of re\nResurgence From Below in both men and\nwomen some men and some women to\noverthrow the sort of oppressive nature\nof role definitions and so forth you\nknow I mean you couldn't think of\nmarrying a person uh in another religion\nfor example you couldn't think of\nmarrying someone of A different race I\nmean it was the price of that meant you\nhad to go live in anonymously in the\ncity somewhere or you couldn't be gay\nfor example uh the love that dare not\nspeak its name as it was called um all\nof that's been radically challenged and\nrightly so and and yet what that does is\nbring about a world of great Freedom\ngreater freedom but also ambiguity you\nknow if this isn't right well but what's\nthis and what's that and people are\ntroubled by ambiguity and so therefore\nthere's there's always a reactive uh\nnature in in some individuals who are\nfighting that you see so again it shows\nup in very ious issues of of racism\nwhether we have abortion or not or\nwhatever the social issue may\nbe lot of what's playing out there is\nthe traditional role definitions versus\na sense of the autonomy of the\nindividual to live his or her journey\nyou say I'd like to shift a bit to\ndiscussions of pathology or um asserted\npathology nowadays I think thanks again\nto social media um or no thanks to\nsocial media um there's a lot of use of\npsychological terms M\nnarcissism\nprojection um\ngaslighting clinical diagnosis I mean I\nI admittedly took the liberty of saying\nthat I as a non-clinician view the the\nlandscape of a lot of social media as as\nborderline and I have no credential to\nbe able to diagnose an individual let\nalone the internet but so I'll be clear\nabout my limitations um whenever\npossible\nbut there are real pathologies of the of\nthe psyche of the mind yes um I'd be\ncurious about your view of the ones that\ntend to capture people's um attention\nthe most you know I mean uh I think we\nNow understand some of the neurochemical\nbasis of certain CH psychiatric\nchallenges schizophrenia bipolar in\nparticular OCD particular sometimes by\nway of which medications they respond to\nor don't um but that alone doesn't allow\nus to understand their underlying\nmechanisms I think a lot of that is\nstill mysterious but I'd love um to get\na different perspective on these things\nwhich is the psychological perspective\nwhich um of course Embraces biology but\num looks at it a little bit differently\nso um yeah what what are your thoughts\nabout the way that these days um these\nwords are slung and\num and what's your view about our actual\ntreatment for these uh for these\nconditions both for the people suffering\nfrom them and the people that suffer\nbecause others suffer from them yeah\nwell you're asking me to speak both as a\ntherapist and as a citizen I think and\nI'll address the first one first um part\nof the therapist's role is to\ndifferential diagnosis in other words if\na person comes in with a depression we\nhave to try to Define what kind of\ndepression are we talking about there\ndifferent kinds of\ndepression is this a reactive depression\nit's only pathological if it lasts too\nlong or lasts interferes with their\nnormal functioning too much and that's a\njudgment call if a person's grieving the\nloss of something important in their\nlife the loss of a marriage would say\nit's appropriate to feel uh depressed\nfor a certain length of time until\nlife's ches move one forward and so\nforth there is um um biologically driven\ndepression which can be approached with\nmedication although many of the\nanti-depressants are very limited in\ntheir success long-term therapy tends to\nbe more effective as various Studies\nhave recognized albeit there's a you\nknow an economic cause to that and then\nthirdly there's what you can call an\nintas psychic depression which is what I\nexperienced was that you know there were\ncertain parts of my life that had been\nwalled off and and you know that was\ncrying out pathology comes from the\nGreek word pathos which means suffering\nand logos which means expression of so\npathology means the expression of the\nsuffering Psychopathology is expression\nof the suffering of the Soul so what is\nit in terms of this person's natural\ndesire to live in a meaningful way\nthat's interfering with her life is it\nbiologically driven is it as function of\nthe social context in which they live or\nis it some personal task that they have\nto address and that kind of differential\ndiagnosis is is essential and as you\nsaid there are certain conditions that\nare predominantly biologically driven\nsuch as schizophrenia bipolar\nEtc so secondly then speaking as as a\ncitizen you know the internet and I\ndon't want to get lost in the internet\nagain but it's like it's a vast Open\nStage in which whatever is unaddressed\nin people can can be put out there\nwithout censorship without reflection\nwithout the other being represented and\nyou know it it allows people to to\nreveal whatever is going on within\nthem uh with without genuine dialogue\nand of course you can have opposition\nbut what has to happen typically is\nagain associating with like-minded\npeople I must be right because these\nother people agree with me you see so\nyou know any of these terms can be\nmisappropriated and and will be sooner\nor later so what one has to say is we\ncan only make diagnosis with you know\nobservation over time it's very hard\ninitially to to know what's really going\non as I mentioned what we do or what\nsomeone does is logical what we don't\nknow is what it's in service to inside\nof them\nand you will not get much sense of that\nby the internet because it's too\nsuperficial that's why it takes repeated\nobservation and conversation for that to\nemerge the reason I keep coming back to\nthe internet is I think it's where most\npeople get their information now it's\nunless they're listening to this as a\npodcast that's where they're going to\nget this information\num I think what you said about um the\nlack of dialogue being really key I mean\nI think we see this now also at the\nlevel of media we have a very polarized\nmedia yes um this is an independent\nmedia channel we don't have a political\nstance despite what some people might\nassert we don't right it's about science\nand health information to the for\neveryone who is interested zero cost\nthat's that's that's the the mission\nunderstood\num when we read and see things now um\nabout politics but also about business\nabout sports about celebrity about kids\nabout culture um all too often the the\nlabels of psychology are placed on those\nkids are depressed they're you know\nthey're not just lonely they're\ndepressed and they may very well be U\nexperiencing high levels of clinical\ndiagnosis of depression that that could\nbe true so you know my concern it's a\nit's a real concern which is why I keep\nbringing this up is that uh in doing\nthat that we both um diminish the\nsuffering of those who are really\nsuffering from those pathologies yeah\nand we also perhaps um create a little\nbit of catastrophizing about you know\nfeeling low for an afternoon um might be\na great source of of stimulus to go like\nyou know write or think or nap or\nInsight um and you know I load to think\nthat in people learning terms that\nsomehow they're getting further away\nfrom what they need\nno I I agree you know Lou pastur from\nwhich from whom we got pasteurization of\ncourse um reportedly put over the\nentrance to his office tell me not your\npolitics or your religion tell me only\nyour suffering and I I always think\nabout that in the context of therapy\nbecause everybody is a suffering Soul\nbecause you know life is difficult and\nthen you die so have a nice day right um\nlife is suffering and that's not that's\nnot pessimistic that's just you know\ndescriptive the question is what does\nthat suffering make you do what does it\nkeep you from doing that's the central\nquestion there is where the person is\ncalled into some\naccountability you know if you're\ndepressed all right what's the task that\nthat depression is asking of you uh if\nyou're anxious where's that anxiety\ncoming from how much of that is archaic\nhow much of that was inherited from\nfamily how much of that is what you know\nunique to your life and what is the task\nthat is to be addressed there I also\nwrote a book called swamplands of the\nsoul that deals with anxiety depression\nloss betrayal etc etc and sooner or\nlater life is going to take us to\nswamplands where you find yourself\nreally mired into something and one will\nfeel very much victimized in that way\nbut that's that's the passive experience\nthe summons is always what is the task\nthat this visitation to the swampland is\nasking of\nyou what do you need to address if if\nyou feel that your partner betrayed you\nand left the marriage for example all\nright and took your self-esteem with\nthat all right well your task is the\nrecovery of self- worth because without\nthat no other choice you make is going\nto be very good um and maybe that's a\nhard project but that's nonetheless the\nwork you have to do so always the\nquestion what does this make you do what\ndoes it keep you from\ndoing and to bring responsibility back\nto the individual and of course some\npeople are willing to accept that\nresponsibility some are not and that\nmakes the difference I had a colleague\nmany moons ago who said she could tell\nin the first hour whether the person she\nwas seeing was a big kid or a little kid\nbecause everybody's recovering child and\nthe big kids could do the work the\nlittle kids wanted someone to tell them\nwhat to do or tell them that there's an\neasy fix to this um and in the long run\nuh those persons going to stay stuck\npretty much until something else happens\nin their life perhaps well to me it\nseems that the the litmus test is the\nextent to which somebody is pointing\nfingers at others or directing the work\ntowards themselves regardless of who was\nwronged sure right one individual both\nindividual like regardless ultimately I\nthink what you're saying and forgive me\nfor interrupting is that if one is\nasking what is the task to develop what\nyou know to control one's anxiety to\ndevelop stronger sense of self to um to\nbetter understand uh what one really\nwants and assert that um to uh set\nbetter boundaries so that um people's\nprojections are not as um permeable to\nus whatever it is\nultimately There's\nNo Business of looking at what others\nare doing wrong in that it's all\nintrospective and self-directed thing\nthat's right well and you gave good\nexamples of the kind of tasks that rise\nout of a person's experience now for\nexample if a person has been subject to\nSerious abuse in childhood physical or\nemotional or sexual or whatever um it's\naffected their entire life well what is\nthe task you know it's it's it's to rest\nfrom that experience a sense of\nself and that one is still here to live\none's Journey that's why I said at the\nbeginning of our conversation I'm not\nwhat happened to me I'm what is wanting\nto be expressed in my life through\nme to get a person to that place take\nsome time and repetition frankly you\nknow the two hardest things I ever\nlearned as a therapist and I still don't\nlike either one of them is patience you\nhave to sit with it over time you have\nto sort and sift and sort and sift and\nhold this over time till something else\nemerges and secondly powerlessness I\ncan't fix anybody right but we can try\nto promote the attitudes and behaviors\nthat will allow that person to find what\nis Right From Within them because\nsomething in each of us always knows\nwhat is right for us if we pay attention\nand if we are willing to honor what\nemerges and have enough courage to\naddress that then we can live in a\ndifferent way and it's very tough in the\nface of subst substantial abuse for\nexample because it was so intrusive and\nso devastating it's cleared out a space\nin which the self seems to find no room\nbut that's that's the task then is the\nrecovery of a sense of self and purpose\nthat's independent of what happened to\noneself it's almost as if one needs to\nreally understand their own story but\nthen be able to depart from that story\nyeah that's why I said one has to have a\nlarger story than what happened to you\nright one has to have a larger story\nthan the story that one's culture gives\nyou or your family of origin gives you\nwhat is that story that's why I said my\ninstructions and my models were to stay\nhome and stay\nsafe something in me hungered and I\nhonor my teachers to this day I enter a\nlocal librarian who showed me any book\nshe said she recognized this kid's a\nreader so she said to me you don't have\nto stay in the children's section you\ncan go anywhere you want in the library\nwhich I I thought was like having a lot\nof candy I I enjoyed that and as a child\nI devoured the biographies of famous\npeople because I think I was looking for\nclues about how do you live a larger\nlife I couldn't have languaged that it\nwas just some deep urge within how do\nyou live this life in a way that's more\nsatisfying and I was privileged to have\nsome people there notably teachers and\nthe librarian who gave permission to\nthat and and supported that and I'm and\nI'm grateful to them so um you know I I\nI think it probably would have happened\nanyway but much later in life but I I\nlook back and I realized there was\nsomething there that wanted to go as I\nsaid to see where the airplanes went\nwhat the ocean looked like what it meant\nto live in a foreign country what it\nmeant to learn a foreign language you\nknow all of those things were\nunimaginable to my family and I you know\nrest their souls um because I I I grieve\nthe life they were not allowed to live\nyou know I I never forget that and then\nit you know causes me to resolve again\nto stop and say all right now where are\nyou being blocked today by convention or\nyour old fears or or your inhibitions or\nor whatever because there's there's\nalways a summon to show up in fact in\none of the books I said my motto which I\nthink about every morning is very simple\nshut up suit up show up now I'm speaking\nto myself when I say this shut up means\nstop whining you know there are people\nwho don't have food today there are\npeople whose children are being killed\ntoday there are people don't have a roof\nover there you you have tons of things\nshut up don't whine speaking to s suit\nup means prepare do your homework don't\nexpect life just to present it to you\nyou have to go out and work hard at\nsomething show up meaning not show off\nbut just do the best you\ncan step into life you know sooner or\nlater life knocks us down death is the\ngreat democracy but you're here to live\nit as best you can by lights that matter\nwithin instead of what people around you\nare saying you know\nand as simplistic as that slogan is I\nknow a lot of people have copied it and\nput it on their refrigerator because\nit's a reminder of this is your life\nyou're accountable what are you going to\ndo about\nthat I'm going let that sink in for\neverybody I think um shut up suit up\nshow up is uh is um essential um I love\nthat I love Eric's stages of\nDevelopmental\nmaturation um for those not familiar um\nEricson I think another danne right is\nit Dane yeah um psychologist you know\nset about to um kind of explain\nneurobiology without knowing any\nneurobiology and asserted that there\nwere specific core conflicts that\ninfants and children young adults and\nadults go through um and the AG the age\nranges are more uh variable now\num based on life expectancy and other\nfactors than they were originally but\none reason I like um Erikson's stages of\ndevelopment so much is that um as a\ndevelopmental neurobiologist first\nthat's where I started out more or less\num it makes perfect sense to me that the\nbrain circuitry would be resolving\ncertain things about interactions with\nphysical objects and relational objects\nand it just makes perfect sense and and\nwhat what genius it was to to um to\nsuperimpose on that um some ideas about\nwhat infants are doing from 0 to one and\nfrom 3 to 5\nEtc rarely if ever do we hear about the\nmaturational stages of adulthood and the\ncore conflicts that we\nall have to go through um you know\nperhaps not exactly from age 45 to 50 or\n50 to 55 or 75 to 80 and so forth but\nthat life as it were might be a series\nof of um trying to make it through\nspecific milestones and when we don't\nmake it through a milestone um problems\narise sure sure you described the first\nhalf of life as one in which we're kind\nof foraging more or less for most people\nunconscious of how our parental\ninfluences or family influences um set\nabout certain patterns that may or may\nnot be healthy for us and then at some\npoint some event\ncomes um often times a painful event but\nthat but it could be a joyous event like\nthe birth of a child or something like\nthat and all of a sudden we get hit\nSquare in the face with the work that we\nneed to\ndo would you say that the second half of\nlife is one in which\nwe because of our life experience and\nbecause of some awareness and yet\nbecause also our brain is yes still\nplastic but it takes more work than when\nwe're kids to to modify our brain\ncircuitry that we you know that we have\nto set about this juggling Act of still\ntrying to understand the self while\nstill bringing the self that we have\ninto the world right we don't we don't\nreally get to pause go to the\nshop and um come out a year later in\nmost cases um so regardless of whether\nor not somebody is 10 15 20 50 or 80\nyears\nold how do we know what our work is then\nlike how do we best know like what to to\nfocus on because it can beit be a bit\noverwhelming to to think about like\ntackling all of this sure sure well let\nme say first of all many years ago I was\nwhen I was still teaching at a\nuniversity um I taught a course on life\nstages and for one of the papers I asked\nthe students to imagine two stages ahead\nof them so if they were typically 18 to\n22 let's say to imagine themselves in\ntheir 40s and try to write about their\nin their 40s and the assignment\ncompletely failed Al although it it was\nmade useful uh for the classroom\ndiscussion because all of them imagine\nin their 40s they would have this\nperfect marriage their adolescent\nchildren will would adore them and they\nwould be in these satisfying careers\ndespite everything we'd read everything\nwe' talked about as a time of turbulence\nand disappointment and and and so forth\nand and it was a complete failure so it\nit's hard for us to imagine that we too\nwill go through these similar kinds of\nthings but usually we do and some of\nthis is triggered by roles in one's life\na lot of it's determined by our own\naging of the body and so forth so for\nexample the last stage in Ericson's um\num\ndiscussion in so-called old age is the\nconflict between Despair and\nintegrity and I remember reading that\nwhen I was young I wondering what did he\nreally mean by that now I know that in a\nvery personal way despair is one sees\nfriends die one sees Avenues in your\nlife closed that you can't possibly do\nthat you're confronted with the unlived\nlife or the mistakes you made you're\ndealing with loss of functions of the\nbody you're you're facing your mortality\nand so forth and so on and how could you\nnot despair in the face of that well at\nthe same time there's again the summons\nto accountability what now is life\nasking of you how are you to show up\ntoday in in this changed environment you\nsee so you know the the stages of life\nyou know and Shakespeare wrote about the\nseven stages of life I think Ericson had\neight stages and again underneath\nthis these things happen right and often\none doesn't realize it one reads about\nit somehow it's sort of like when you're\nyoung yes mortal I understand I'm mortal\nbut you know that happens to people out\nthere you know it's not part of my DNA\nyou see well it is and sooner or later\nlife is going to unfold unless it's cut\noff in some way you know and uh I\nremember reading when I was in graduate\nschool um a saying in ancient Greece\nthat I saw in several different\nenvironments and it said best of all is\nnot to have been born second best is to\nhave died young and I thought gee how\nawful that is right well I think I've\nunderstood why they were saying that if\nyou if if you're born into the veil of\nTears so to speak you're born into\nsuffering you're you're you're born into\nmortality you're born into loss and so\nforth if you're going to live you're\ngoing to go through some of those if you\nlive long enough you'll go through the\nloss of people you love and care about\nyou may outlive your children as I've\nhad an experience and sooner or later\nyou know life will take you to these\ndifficult places and what are you going\nto do then who are you then and how are\nyou going to address that and that's\nwhere the issue of Integrity came in and\nI think Ericson was was right on that to\nin to be a person of integrity means to\nintegrate something to pull back one's\nstuff and and sense this is who I am and\nand this is where I stand Visa this\ndilemma it's why I said the Practical\nquestion is how now am I to live my life\nin the face of this\nsituation that's a task that comes to\neach of us at at some place in our life\nand that never goes\naway let's talk about death okay I've\noften wondered whether or not um the\nhuman brain's ability\nto um adjust the aperture of our time\nperception is an Adaptive thing because\nwe're we to not be able to do that we\nwould probably always focus on the fact\nthat at some point we are going to die\nthis to me um is analogous to uh\nsituation in space not outer space but\num let's just frame it this way we can\nOrient in time and in particular under\nconditions of stress the our time\nHorizon tends to shrink we have to solve\nfor now we get the troubling text\nmessage somebody's we care about is in\ntrouble we need to solve for now now so\nthe time Horizon has shrunk we're on\nvacation we're relaxed everything's\ntaken care of we're fed we're rested our\nloved ones are safe we're safe and all\nof a sudden we can Daydream right so um\nin the space domain um the brain can\nlearn to navigate a small environment\nlike this room um and in conversation\nwe're present to this room but we can\nalso imagine that we're just two people\namong billions of other people floating\non a planet in the galaxies and we can\nexpand our notion of space the\nspace-time dimensionality of perception\nof the human brain is vast and it can be\nconsciously controlled or unconsciously\ncontrolled so that's great it allows us\nto be functional in a number of\ndifferent SpaceTime Dimensions um it\nalso can allow us to avoid the reality\nwhich is that at some point our time\nhere is finite yes and the example you\ngave earlier of somebody who is just\ntrying to pile up as much money to get\nto the y was an example I think of a a\nshorten time\nHorizon other compulsive behaviors maybe\neven addictive behaviors I would argue\num have some component often of being a\nway to avoid the reality of death it's a\nway of packing away the fear of death\nbecause if you can create these\nreward-based which eventually become\npunishment based in the case of\naddiction um milestones and and\nalgorithms that the brain is running\nsolve for this now solve for this now\nsolve for this you Stave off the reality\nwhich is death is\ncoming are we as humans meaning is it\nour work if we wish to be the most\nconscious healthy version of\nourselves um to understand and\nacknowledge our sense of mortality I I\nthink of the um what I consider the\ngreat commencement speech of Steve Jobs\nat Stanford in 2015 where he talks about\nthe the knowledge of one's mortality is\nactually in his words more or less one\nof the most important features of our\nself-recognition as humans um so that's\nthe question and then the um the\nchallenge becomes how often to think\nabout it um you don't want to think\nabout too much it can uh because it can\nbe paralyzing it can lead I mean if we\njust think that we're if we acknowledge\nthat we are indeed it's a fact just two\npeople among billions floating around on\na planet in the M then then nothing\nreally matters right our one can get the\nsense that our impact is zero but if we\nover um emphasize our impact thinking\nthat everything we do like the movement\nof this book is going to impact\nmolecules that then will impact you go\nyou'd go crazy you become dysfunctional\nin a real way so those are the two\nextremes and I'll just kind of set that\nabout and and let um for uh reflection\nbut it in terms of our our sense of our\nown mortality and what that means about\nour sense of life seems like a pretty\nbig topic and I know you're writing a\nbook about this and I'm very excited to\nread it when it comes out well I've\nactually written about it before um the\nParadox here is it's mortality that\nmakes this life\nmeaningful if we were\nImmortal we would simply do this for a\ncentury then we' get bored and then we\ndo something else for a century and then\nget bored and then something else for a\ncentury life is short as as Yung said\nthat short pause between two great\nmysteries from whence we come we know\nnot whether we go we don't know the\nproblem is the identification of the ego\none of the things that's occurred is in\nmany traditional cultures that ego was\nsubsumed as I said into a larger story\ntake away that story and what's going to\nfill that space the ego you know my my\nown importance my\nself-perpetuation the fact that people\nhave Frozen their brains and wanting to\nbe revived in some future um you know\nera is a good example of denial it seems\nto me um it's it's life means something\nbecause your choices are finite you\ndon't live here\nforever now when the more you identify\nwith the ego the more threatened you're\ngoing to be by that um and and then you\nbegin to realize all right the center of\nmy personality is not the ego there are\nseveral things to say about this none of\nwhich is proof of anything simply\nobservations uh and and Yung pointed\nthis out in a essay once called the soul\nin death um psyche doesn't seem to\nrecognize uh its own termination people\nwho are overtly dying and they know\nthey're dying and I one of my patients\nright now is a gleo blastoma client\nwho's who's not going to be here in a\nfew\nmonths um who's acutely aware of of\nmortality but the dreams have to do with\nJourneys and crossings and things of\nthat sort in other words as if\nthe human psyche is not bound by time\nand space per se but the ego is so if\nthere's another life it's another life\nyou know if there's a life after this\nit's another life this is the only one\nwe know about for\nsure and I would say in terms of the\nfear of death which most people don't\nwant to talk about but sooner or later\nit comes up in therapy no matter what\nstage of life one is involved\nin you know is either\neither there is another life of some\nkind which is larger than my imagination\ncan conjure up or there's an\nannihilation of this ego identity either\ncase my theories about it and my\nanxieties about it are rendered\nmoot so again the more I identify with\nthe ego Consciousness the more I'm tied\ninto its perpetuation the less I'm\nidentified with that the less it\nmatters I would say to you at this\nmoment I'm trying to be as honest as I\ncan about it the chief thing I worry\nabout as I approach my\nmortality uh is I don't want my wife to\nbe alone I care for her and I know there\nare areas where she needs my help and I\nwant to be here for her as long as I can\nand my existence a little over a year\nago was sort of problematic coming out\nof the all those surgeries so that's one\nreason we moved to retirement community\nso there' be some structure there for\nher secondly I don't you know want to\nsuffer obviously um but that's outside\nof my control and and thirdly I'm still\ncurious as a human being there's so much\nto learn and when we're talking about\nthe internet and its perils it's also an\nenormous learning tool I I love to\nGoogle up things and find out about\nthings that used to be so difficult to\nlearn about so I I still heavily\ninvested in the adventure of life but\nI'm less and\nless um attached to it in some peculiar\nway uh it's the ego attachment you know\num the German word galenite mean is the\nword for serenity it's it's the\ncondition of having let\ngo and the only solution so to speak for\nour fear of mortality is accepting it\nparadoxically of letting go of the\nfantasy of the sovereignty of the ego\nthat it's immune somehow to the Natural\norder of things the natural progression\nof things now I'm not saying that makes\nme wholly unafraid of death that would\nbe delusional and it's in another way\nbut I can say that I'm not defined by it\nin any way and I think you're right A\nlot of people what what it usually\nproduces is either depression and and\ntoror of some kind or phonetic\nactivity so the inability of a person to\nrelativize the ego in the context of the\nidea of the\nsoul and does that Soul perpetuate I\ndon't know if I knew I would tell\nyou I wouldn't want to keep that a\nsecret I don't know it's a\nmystery maybe I'll be a conscious enough\nto experience it maybe I'll just be\nannihilated either way as I said my\npresent speculations are just that\nspeculations and ultimately irrelevant\nand again the thing we have to recognize\nit's mortality that makes this life mean\nsomething because your choices matter\nyou're here a short time what are you\ngoing to do with that precious gift you\ncall your life what are you g to do with\nit I can't think of a more appropriate\nplace to end and yet um I have still so\nmany more questions um but I think\nbecause of today's conversation I\nrealized that those questions are uh\nquestions to ask of self um as I think\neveryone listening and watching this\nsurely is stimulated to ask ask many\nimportant questions of self um I must\nsay\nI'm both um a bit a struck frankly\nbecause I uh you know again I'm familiar\nwith your teachings and and work in the\nform of books um and it was a great wish\nof mine in my life journey to sit down\nwith you uh face to face and have a\nconversation so um that's why I'm uh\nspeaking more slowly today than I\nnormally do uh my audience perhaps will\nnotice that and if they send some\nemotion it's that I feel like there's\njust so much richness here to take in uh\nfor myself and for everyone listening to\ntake in um I'm certainly going to listen\nto this again and and take careful notes\nand we we likely will put some notes and\nsome highlights we always timestamp\neverything so that people can navigate\nback but I think there are just so many\num essential prompts of the self of the\nsoul that um people are going to be\nmotivated to take as a consequence of of\nhearing your words today so uh I just\nreally want to say thank you so much for\nthe work that you've done and that\nyou're doing and continuing to do um and\nfor taking the time to share this uh\nthis information with us because it's it\nreally is uh it really is the the guts\nlike the core stuff of of being a human\nbeing so thank you so much well thank\nyou Andrew may I just ask add as a\nfootnote here there's a wonderful letter\nof\npoet RKA to a young man in which he\nsaid you want the answers the key is to\nfind the right questions and live the\nquestions you're not yet ready to live\nthe answers but you you ask the right\nquestions in time if you live them\nhonestly with as much Integrity as you\ncan manage someday you'll live your way\ninto their answers for you and that's\nwhat I would say h ask large questions\nas children we did what was the about\nwhy am I here what's what's the story\nwhat's going on here we get so inured to\nthose questions by our adaptive\nnecessities and we have to come back to\nthose questions I'm still asking those\nquestions I've do it consciously now ask\nlarge questions you'll live a large and\ninteresting Journey ask small questions\nand it gets diminished somehow\nanother thing I say to a lot of patients\nwhen you reach a a decisive point in\nyour life we have to make a decision one\nway or the other ask does this path\nenlarge me psychos spiritually or does\nit diminish me and you usually know the\nanswer to that if you choose the larger\npath you're going to grow and develop it\nit's going to take something out of you\nbut it'll give something to you if you\ndon't your life gets narrower and\nnarrower and narrower and something\ninside of you knows the difference and\nsooner or later the psyche is going to\nshow up with its point of view and the\nmore we fled from that kind of question\nthat kind of conversation the more\npathology is going to erupt when we've\navoided the big question so thank you\nfor asking big questions and thank you\nfor inviting me to be part of
