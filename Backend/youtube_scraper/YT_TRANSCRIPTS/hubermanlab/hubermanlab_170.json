    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Paul Conti.\nDr. Conti is a psychiatrist\nwho did his training at\nStanford School of Medicine,\nand then went on to be chief resident\nat Harvard Medical School.\nHe now runs the Pacific Premier Group,\nwhich is a collection of\npsychiatrists and therapists\nfocusing on solving\ncomplex human problems,\nincluding trauma, addiction, personality,\nand psychiatric disorders.\nToday, we discuss trauma in detail\nand the therapeutic process in detail.\nFor instance, we discuss what is trauma?\nHow do you know if you have trauma?\nDr. Conti shares with us, for instance,\nthat not every experience\nthat we think is traumatic\nis necessarily traumatic\nand yet many people might have trauma\nwithout even realizing it.\nWe also talk about the\ntherapeutic process generally,\nfor instance, how to pick a therapist,\nhow to best approach\nand go through therapy\nand how to evaluate whether or not therapy\nand your relationship to the\ntherapist is working or not.\nWe also talk about self\ntherapies because we acknowledge\nthat not everyone has access\nto or can afford therapy.\nAnd we talk about drug therapies,\nfor instance, antidepressants,\nantipsychotics.\nWe talk about alcohol, cannabis,\nketamine and the psychedelics,\nincluding psilocybin, LSD.\nAnd we talk about the clinical use of MDMA\nand what the future of that looks like.\nThe reason for bringing\nDr. Conti onto this podcast\nis because I see him as the person\nwho has the greatest and most\nholistic view of therapy,\ntrauma, drug therapies, talk therapies,\nand how self therapy and work\nwith others can be integrated\nfor both healing and growing\nfrom difficult circumstances.\nDr. Conti is also the author\nof an exceptional book,\nentitled \"Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic,\nHow trauma works and how\nwe can heal from it.\"\nThat book describes trauma\nand its many features and many tools,\nsome of which we discuss\non the podcast today.\nSo whether or not you have trauma or not,\nby the end of today's episode,\nyou will have a much deeper understanding\nabout what trauma is.\nIn fact, I'm confident\nthat you will gain insight\ninto whether or not\nyou have trauma or not,\nwhether or not people close\nto you have trauma or not\nand the various paths to\nrecovering and indeed growing\nfrom trauma that we can all take.\nAs you'll soon learn Dr. Conti\nis an exceptional communicator\nand has a unique window\ninto the trauma and therapeutic process\nthat I know that all\nof us can benefit from.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however,\npart of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost\nto consumer information about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nwas designed with performance in mind.\nI spent a lifetime working\non the visual system\nand I can tell you that our\nvisual system has to contend\nwith a lot of different challenges.\nFor instance, when you\nmove from a shady area\nto a brightly lit area,\nyour eyes in your brain\nhave to adjust in order\nfor you to be able to see clearly.\nROKA, eyeglasses and sunglasses\nwere designed with the biology\nof the visual system in mind.\nSo you never notice those transitions.\nThey're very seamless.\nYou always see things\nwith perfect clarity.\nThe other terrific thing about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses is\nthey are extremely lightweight.\nMost of the time,\nI can't even remember\nthat I'm wearing them.\nI wear readers at night\nand I wear sunglasses\nsometimes in the daytime\nwhen it is very brighter\nor I'm driving and so on.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\neyeglasses or sunglasses,\ngo to roka.com,\nthat's roka.com and enter the\ncode Huberman to save 20% off\non your first order.\nAgain, that's roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also brought\nto us by inside tracker.\nInside tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help\nyou reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nour immediate and long-term health\ncan only be measured and assessed\nwith a quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nwe can also get insight\ninto, for instance,\nour biological age and\nsee how that compares\nto our chronological age.\nAnd of course,\ndespite what our birthday\ncake screams back at us,\nit is our biological\nage that really matters.\nIf you're going to get blood\ntests or DNA tests, however,\nyou need to be able to interpret the data.\nAnd that's really where\ninside tracker stands apart.\nA lot of companies will give\nyou a DNA test or a blood test.\nThey'll send you values of\nhormones, metabolic markers,\netcetera, but you don't know\nwhat to do with those data.\nInsideTrackeris a very\neasy to use platform.\nSo when you get the numbers back,\nyou can click on any of the\nnumbers that either are in range\nor out range, too low, too high, etcetera,\nand it will direct you towards\nspecific behavioral tools,\nso lifestyle factors, nutritional tools,\nsupplement tools, etcetera,\nthat can help you bring those numbers\ninto the ranges that are best for you,\nwhich is really an exceptional\ntool that makes all the blood\ntests and DNA tests really\nexceptionally powerful.\nIf you'd like to try Inside Tracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nThat's inside tracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Blinkist.\nBlinkist is an app that has\nthousands of non-fiction books\ncondensed down to just 15 minutes each\nof key takeaways that you\ncan read or listen to,\nto extract the most important\nknowledge from those books.\nI love reading physical books,\nliterally physical hard copies of books.\nAnd I like listening to audio books.\nHowever, I also like to revisit books\nthat I've read or listened to,\nand sometimes I just want\nto get the key points\nor the key takeaways from a book\nthat I've never read or listened to.\nBlinkist is terrific for all of that.\nFor instance, when researching\nour episodes on sleep,\none of the books that I\nread and found very valuable\nis Matt Walker, professor\nat UC Berkeley's book,\n\"Why We Sleep,\"\nI've read that book,\nbut then I wanted to also make sure\nthat I hit the key takeaways.\nBlinkist was essential for that.\nOther books that I've read\nbefore and that I own and enjoy,\nbut I listened to the Blinkist\nversion of from time to time\nare things like Tim\nFerris's \"The 4-Hour Body\"\nor Tim Ferris's The 4-Hour Chef book,\nboth of which are excellent\nor Nassim Taleb's \"The Black Swan\"\nand there are many other titles as well.\nBlinkist is also a great way\nto finally get through many of the books\nthat you've been meaning to read,\nbut haven't had time for.\nWith Blinkist, you get\nunlimited access to reader\nor listen to a massive library\nof condensed non-fiction books.\nRight now, Blinkist has a special offer\njust for our Huberman\nlab podcast audience.\nIf you go to blinkist.com/huberman,\nyou can get a free seven day trial\nand get 25% off a Blinkist\npremier membership.\nThat's Blinkist spelled B-L-I-N-K-I-S-T,\nblinkist.com/huberman to get 25% off\nand a seven day free trial.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Paul Conti.\nPaul, thank you so much\nfor being here today.\n- Thank you so much for having me.\n- I've been looking forward to this\nand I've received a ton\nof questions about trauma,\nabout therapy,\nabout how to assess\nwhere one is in their own\narc of problems and addressing\nfamilial issues and relationship\nissues and so forth.\nIf we could just start off very basic\nand just get everyone oriented.\n- Sure.\n- How should we define trauma?\nWe all have hard experiences.\nSome of them, we might\nruminate on more than others,\nbut what is trauma?\n- To make the definition relevant,\nI think we have to look at\ntrauma as not anything negative\nthat happens to us, right?\nBut something that\noverwhelms our coping skills,\nthen leaves us different\nas we move forward.\nSo it changes the way that\nour brains function, right?\nAnd then that changes evident in us\nas we move forward through life.\n- So how do we know if\nwe have trauma or not?\nI've heard before everyone has trauma.\nFor instance, I've heard\nthat if we are a child\nor when we are a child\nand we request love from\na parent or attention\nfrom a parent,\nif they dismiss us that\nthat's a microtrauma,\nis that overstating or unfair\nto the real issue of trauma?\nDo we all have trauma?\nWhat are micro traumas?\nWhat are macro traumas?\n- Right, I think traumas\nthat we might categorize\nas disappointments, right?\nOr things that are are negative,\nbut not deeply impactful,\nI think is not a helpful\ndefinition, right?\nI think the helpful definition\nis something that rises\nto the magnitude of really\nchanging us and something\nthat we can see both in how we behave.\nWe can see it in mood,\nanxiety, behavior, sleep, physical health.\nSo we can identify it\nand we can also see it in brain changes.\nSo the fact that we become,\nsay more hypervigilant, right?\nMore vigilant,\nand then we can see that\ndifferent parts of the brain\nare more active.\nSo that definition,\nthat definition captures how trauma,\nif it rises to a certain\nlevel, like what we would say,\ntrauma that makes a post\ntrauma syndrome, right?\nLeaves us different,\nI think is the helpful\ndefinition of trauma\nbecause it's a clinical definition, right?\nIt's changes in us as people\nand we can map those changes\nto identifiable shifts\nin our brain function.\n- So how do we know if we've\nbeen changed by something?\nI mean, I can think\nback to childhood events\nwhere some kid on the playground\nor in the classroom said something,\nI didn't like, something\nnegative about me.\nI think most people can do that.\nWe have a great memory for the kid\nthat said something awful,\nor the parent or teacher\nthat said something awful\nthat really felt like it hurt\nus or at least stuck with us.\nSo clearly one's brain,\nmy brain in this example has been changed\nby that event such that I remember it,\nbut how do we know if something\nhas actually changed the way that we are?\nBecause of course we don't\nknow how we would be otherwise.\n- Right, right.\n- That's difficult, right.\nIt's doable, but it's\ndifficult because the response,\nso if the trauma rises to the\nlevel of changing our brains\nand I don't just mean, like\nwe have a new memory, right?\nSo we can have memories\nof something that was negative, right?\nAnd in that sense,\nit changes the brain because\nnow there's something we can call to mind,\nbut it doesn't change the\nfunctioning of the brain, right?\nIf trauma rises to the level\nof changing the functioning of our brains,\nthen there's almost always\na reflex of guilt and shame\naround the trauma that can lead us\nand often leads us to bury,\nright, to avoid it, right?\nTo feel that now there's\nsomething negative inside of me\nand it feels shameful\nor it feels like no one\nelse would accept it, right?\nSo, what happens is people tend to avoid\nlooking at the change in them,\nwhich is exactly the opposite\nof what needs to be done, right?\nThe idea of in a viral pandemic, right?\nWe want to stay away from one\nanother and isolate, right?\nBut with the trauma epidemic we need,\nwe need to communicate with other people.\nWe need to communicate and\nput words to what's going on\ninside of us.\nAnd very often a, a person knows, I mean,\nI've done so much clinical\nwork over about 20 years,\nthat has focused on trauma.\nAnd a lot of the times\nthe person knows, right?\nBut they're not admitting to themselves\nbecause they're afraid of it, right?\nThey don't know what to do,\nbut if they start talking,\nthen they'll talk about\nthe event or the situation.\nIt could be something acute,\nor it could be something chronic,\nthat really has been\nharmful to them, right?\nAnd then they feel different afterwards.\nLike, oh, after that,\nI started thinking differently,\nfeeling differently,\nbut that doesn't always happen.\nSometimes it's a process of exploration\nthrough dialogue, right?\nWhether it's written\nor whether it's spoken\nof the person,\nso of exploring the changes\ninside of themselves,\nmaybe changes to their self-talk inside,\nchanges to their thoughts about the world\nand whether they can navigate\nsafely and readily in it.\nAnd you know, it anchors\nas I talk about this,\nthe example I'll use at times\nis the example of my own life,\nwhere, you know, when I was much younger\nin my early twenties,\nmy younger brother took\nhis life by suicide.\nAnd the response of guilt and shame\nand hiding all of it inside of me was,\nit's very dramatic,\nbut I wasn't acknowledging it, right?\n'Cause I didn't know what to do about it.\nAnd I felt guilty and I felt\nresponsible and I felt ashamed.\nSo there was an avoidance inside of me.\nAnd then I wasn't saying to\nmyself, hey, before this,\nlike you thought that\nyou could be effective\nand you could make your way in the world.\nAnd you know, if you were a\ngood person and you worked hard,\nyou could make a difference, right?\nAnd then afterwards, I\nthought, I can't get anywhere.\nThe world's against me.\nAnd I felt like, oh my,\nmy options are all gone.\nAnd you know,\nI was like 24 years old, right?\nSo, I didn't see that\nthe change was in me,\nbut I was taking care of myself poorly.\nLike there was enough\ngoing on that was unhealthy\nthat I couldn't avoid the\nrealization that like, hey,\nI'm different now and in\nthese ways that are automatic.\nMy reflex to, can I make\nmy way in the world?\nCan I have a good life?\nCan I be happy?\nMy reflex is to that we're all different.\nAnd they were coming through\nthe lens of heightened anxiety,\nheightened vigilance, a sense of guilt,\na sense of shame and a\nsense of non belonging\nin the world\nand was ultimately good and\nhelpful people around me\nand my own realization.\nAnd hey, things are not going well, right?\nThat led me to then get some help\nand to be able to talk about it\nand realize like, oh my gosh,\nI need to face these things\nthat are going on inside of me.\n- From a psychoanalytic psychological,\nand maybe even a neuroscience\nperspective, two questions.\nWhy do you think that\nwhen we experience trauma,\nthese things that we call\nguilt and shame surface?\nEverything you're telling\nme is that in the end,\nthat's not adaptive.\n- Hmm.\n- [Paul] Why would we be built that way?\n- Right, right.\n- So that's the first question.\nAnd then the second question is,\nhow should we conceptualize\nguilt and shame?\nI think that we hear guilt.\nWe hear shame.\nHow should we think about it?\nI mean, those emotions must\nexist in us for some reason,\nbut in this case, it seems like they,\nthey don't serve us well.\nSo maybe it that order\nor in reverse order,\nwhat is guilt, really?\nWhat is shame really?\nAnd why is it that we seem\nto be reflexively wired\nto feel guilty and feel\nashamed when that's the exact\nopposite of what we need to\ndo in the case of trauma?\n- Right, right.\nNo, I think these are great questions.\nAnd I don't think anyone\nknows the answers for sure.\nBut my read of all of that\nis that there's something\nadaptive that has happened in us\nthrough evolution that\nnow becomes maladaptive\nin the way we live in\nthe modern world, right?\nSo if you think of through\nmost of human development,\npeople weren't living that long, right?\nAnd the idea was to survive and reproduce.\nSo, traumatic things that happened to us,\nit would make sense for\nthem to stay with us, right?\nSo if you ate a new food and got really,\nreally sick, you better\nremember that, right?\nIf you see someone from\nthe group of people,\na couple miles away, right?\nAnd one of those people\nattacks you, right?\nIt's like, you better remember that.\nSo, the traumatic things\nthat are sort of emblazoned in our brain\nare built to last, right?\nThings that are positive will generate\nsome emotion inside of us,\nbut things that are profoundly negative\nare much more likely to stay with us.\nAnd I think that that was adaptive, right?\nWhen all of that was\nabout survival, right?\nAnd I think the same thing is\ntrue with say shame, right?\nSo I think here, it makes\nsense to talk a little bit\nand actually I'm interested\nyour thoughts about this, right?\nThat the limbic system, right?\nSo the system often is called\nthe emotion system, right?\nIn our brains has actually of course\nvarying function, right?\nAnd one aspect is affect, right?\nSo affect is aroused in us,\nwhich I think the meaning then\nis it's created in us\nwithout our choice, right?\nSo if we're walking down the road\nand someone jumps in front\nof us or pushes us, right?\nThen there's a response\nof fear, anger, right?\nHeart starts beating faster,\nmore blood to the muscles,\nwe're getting ready to fight, right?\nOr run, right?\nAnd then we become aware of it, right?\nSo, the aroused affect in\nus is also about survival\nand it has a very deep impact upon us\nand shame is an aroused affect.\nSo it can be raised in\nus without our choice\nand it's very powerful,\nwhich if you think about that\nis an extremely strong deterrent, right?\nSo if you had, you know,\nimagine a tribe or a\ngroup of people, right?\nThat are sheltered\ntogether, and, you know,\nsomeone eats half the food\nat night or something, right?\nAnd like there's a very\nnegative response, right?\nAnd that person feels shame\nbecause shame is so powerful\nto control behavior, right?\nSo the way that trauma\ncan change our brains\nand stay with us in a way\nthat says, be more vigilant,\nlook at the world in a different way,\nact more defensively, right?\nAnd how that links to shame and to guilt,\nand then guilt in,\nguilt becomes what gets\ncalled feeling technically\nwhere we relate the aroused\naffect to ourselves, right?\nSo, shame the aroused affect and guilt,\nthe next step, right?\nWhen the shame gets related\nto self are such profound\nbehavioral interventions\nand deterrents, right?\nThat you can see,\nI think how evolutionarily\nkind of all makes sense\nif we're fighting for survival\nand we're an elder statesman\nif we make it to 20, right?\nThis makes sense.\nBut it doesn't make sense in a world\nwhere we live much longer, right?\nWe navigate in all\nsorts of different ways.\nAnd there's so much coming at\nus that can be traumatizing.\nI mean, if you think\nabout the news, right?\nI mean, how many times have\nI written a prescription\nfor someone that says no more news, right?\n- You've actually written\nthose prescriptions?\n- Oh, yes, yes.\nSo glance at the news,\nlook at the news for news,\nanything going on I need to know, right?\nBut what are people doing is looking at it\nand they're clicking and they're clicking.\nAnd there's a sense of\nbeing like enthralled\nin a very frightening way with the horrors\nthat are in front of us.\nAnd it shows how yes,\ntrauma can come through acute\nthings that happen to us.\nTrauma can come through chronic\nthings, chronic denigration,\nwhether it's based upon\nsocioeconomic status,\nimmigration status,\nrace, religion, sexuality,\ngender identity, these\nchronic traumas, right?\nOf being denigrated by\nthe society around us,\nor treated as less than\ncan change the brain.\nBut vicarious experiences can too, right?\nAnd we know this is not theoretical.\nWe know that the changes in the brain\ncan come from vicarious experiences too,\nwhich is why people who\nare glued to the news\nand then feeling like, oh my goodness,\nlike what is happening?\nThe mothers in the Ukraine who've\nlost babies in the war.\nAnd like, there are things\nthat are so terrifying\nthat if we spend so much time with that,\nit has a similar effect.\nSo our brains are built\nto change from trauma,\nbut not in the way we experience trauma\nand not in the way that we live life\nin terms of the nature of living life\nand the duration of life\nin the modern world,\nwhere these traumas that happen to us\nare often so bad for us\nbecause they change how\nour brain is functioning.\nAnd then our entire orientation\nto the world is different\nand that could be for,\nyears and years and decades and decades.\nIt brings so much misery and suffering\nand at times it brings death.\nIf you think about a hundred\nthousand overdose deaths\nin this country in a year, 100,000,\nI mean where is a,\nso much of that arising from\nis a person who's treated\naddiction very intensively\nover many years.\nI think that, well,\nI feel sure that the majority of addiction\nthat I see and treat arises,\nultimately the roots of it are\nin trauma and are in trying\nto soothe something that's\nstuck inside that the person\nisn't letting outside because\nof the guilt and shame,\nbut it's running around in their head\nand tormented by it.\nAnd now there's a pool for,\nfor these drugs or sometimes\nmedicines to soothe.\nSo, the opiates\nthat were given after\na minor surgery, right?\nAre like, okay, yeah,\nthey help the pain for the minor surgery,\nbut what they're really helping\nis the pain inside, right?\nBut that very quickly turns\ninto addiction, danger, risk.\nAnd we see that over and over again\nand not in a theoretical way.\nLike I see that in people\nwho have been in my practice\nwith addiction, arising from trauma\nwho have subsequently died.\nSo it's sort of, writ\nlarge in our existence,\nin the modern world.\n- Incredible to me that\nthis is the way it works.\nWhat I mean by that is\nthis idea that I've heard about before.\nI think it was a Freudian concept\nof a repetition compulsion.\n- Yes.\n- That this is what boggles my mind,\nas I'm hearing this,\nsomething happens to us or we\nobserve something traumatic.\nAnd instead of acknowledging that\nand trying to distance from it,\nthere seems to be a\nreflex of shame and guilt\nin many cases and stuffing it away\nand then a repetition of behaviors\nto continue to try and just stuff it away.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Like you're trying\nto pack, I don't know,\nrecently I was packing a home\nand trying to get a sleeping\nbag back into the bag.\nit seems like it's always\ntrying mushroom out the top,\nthis kind of thing.\nIt takes a lot of ongoing effort.\nAnd at the same time that\nif this thing really exists,\nthis repetition compulsion,\npeople will return over and over again\nto the kinds of scenarios\nor at least the kinds\nof emotional states that\nlook just like the trauma.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Or resemble it in some way.\nSo the question I have for you is,\nis the repetition compulsion a real thing?\nAnd why would we be wired that way?\nMy understanding of this\nconcept of the repetition\ncompulsion is that we all\nwant to solve our traumas.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And it allows us to put\nourselves into micro or again,\nmacro versions of that\nover and over again.\nWe get to run the\nexperiment again and again.\n- Right.\n- In an attempt to solve it.\n- Right.\n- In the case of taking a drug\nthat it's clear certain\ndrugs like opioids,\nit's clear how that would not allow us,\nto deal with it, right?\n- [Paul] Yeah.\n- It's just masking the emotional state.\nBut why is it for instance that somebody\nwho experiences sexual trauma,\nthen places themselves into circumstances\nof more sexual trauma?\nWhy is it that somebody who\nis in an abusive relationship\ngoes on to have a second and\nthird or fourth verbally,\nor physically abusive relationship?\nYeah, I mean, on the\nface of it, you just go,\nthat makes no sense.\nAnd yet we see this over\nand over and over again.\n- Yes, the first thing I would say\nabout the validity of the repetition\ncompulsion concept, right?\nIs a strong yes.\nLike, yes, we see that over and over.\nIt's not necessarily in everyone, but boy,\nit is in a lot of people\nwho have suffered trauma.\nAnd I think there's a very\ngood reason on the face,\non the surface of it, it's\nlike, it makes no sense.\nBut then if we think,\nwell, how does the brain,\nhow does our brains\nactually function, right?\nWe're sort of trained at\nleast in Western society,\nI think, to think of ourselves\nas logical creatures, right?\nThat like, oh, we're logical.\nAnd ultimately everything in\nus can just boil down to logic.\nAnd if we think about it enough,\nwe're going to understand how\nto make the right decisions,\nwhich is completely not true, right?\nThe limbic system, right?\nThe emotion system so\nto speak inside of us\nalways Trump's logic, right?\nIf you think about,\ndoes it ever make sense to\nrun into a burning building?\nI mean, logic says no, right?\nBut if someone you love is\nin the burning building,\npeople run right in, right?\nBecause the limbic system says, yes.\nSo when logic and emotion\ncome head to head,\nemotion wins all the time.\nIf emotion is powerful enough,\nit will always win.\nAnd so the limbic system is\nso important and the limbic\nsystem does not care about the\nclock or the calendar, right?\nAnd that's the answer.\nAnd also, say why\nto the repetition compulsion.\nSo the limbic system doesn't know like,\noh, it's now, it's today.\nIt's may, it's 2022.\nIt just doesn't care at all, right?\nSo how I would relate that\nto the repetition compulsion\nis when people are repeating,\nwhat they're trying to do is\nto make things right, right?\nWith the idea that if we\ncan repeat the situation\nand make it right, it will\nfix everything, right?\nWhich makes perfect sense if we think,\nwell, where is that\nconcept coming from, right?\nIt's coming from the\nemotional part of the brain\nthat wants relief from\nsuffering of the trauma\nand does not understand\nthe clock or the calendar.\nSo if I can solve something now,\nI will also solve something\nin the past, right?\nWhich is why I can't\ntell you how many times\nI've sat with someone and say,\nwe're starting to do therapy, right?\nAnd a person will say, oh\ngosh, like I know, look,\nyou just can't help me, right?\nI mean, you know,\nmy last seven relationships\nhave been abusive, right?\nAnd I'll say back something\nsometimes like, well,\nif you tell me that you've\nhad seven relationships\nthat have been abusive in different ways,\nI'll agree with you.\nLike, I only say that,\n'cause that's never what\nsomeone says, right?\nBut I think what you're going\nto tell me is you've kind of had\nthe same relationship seven times.\nIt's not seven things, it's one, right?\nAnd that's always, I\ndon't think one time yet\nthat has failed to be the case.\nAnd that's how, so if you think about it,\nthat's how we start to\nelucidate what's going on.\nSo they make the light bulb that goes off.\nLike I have not had seven\ndifferent abusive relationships.\nI have had one that I\nhave repeated seven times\nand now we start getting\nto what's really going on\nand what needs to happen,\nthat person needs to face\nwhat happened in that original\nabusive relationship\nand it always comes down to\nthe same sort of concepts,\nof the person feeling terrified\nwhile the abuse was going on,\nfeeling guilty, feeling\nashamed, feeling like, oh,\nthey brought it on themselves.\nThey deserve it.\nThey don't deserve anything better, right?\nBecause the brain is trying\nto make sense of it, right?\nOr I thought I could make that\nokay, but I couldn't, right?\nAnd then there's more\nguilt and more shame.\nAnd if that's stuck inside of someone,\nlike that's bundled up inside of someone,\nlike a medical abscess inside a person,\na walled off infection inside the body,\nthis is the same concept in the brain,\nthen of course the limb system\nis going to want to fix that.\nAnd it fixes it by trying to\nlet's recreate that situation\nand make it right this\ntime and that's, I mean,\nI think that one of the best examples\nof how the right approach of\nhow like, let's look at that,\nlet's talk about that, right?\nWhat's really going on there,\nwait, who should feel guilty\nand ashamed is the person who is a abused\nor the person who is abusing, right?\nAnd we can get it what's\ngoing on inside the person.\nAnd that's what changes that.\nAnd then the eighth relationship\ncan be entirely different\nthan the first seven, right?\nAnd I see that all the time.\nI mean, this isn't esoteric or soft.\nLike I see that play out\nclinically over and over again.\nAnd why do things get better?\nBecause we go to the\ntrauma and we unlock it.\nIt's not hidden inside where\nit can control things, right?\nWe bring it to the surface\nand we can take away its power.\n- I keep hearing in this narrative\nthat so much of our\nreflexive response to trauma,\nboth emotional and in the\nrepetition compulsion in terms\nof behaviors is about\nsome very deep attempt\nto change the past.\n- Yes.\n- And in fact, in an offline conversation,\nI recall you saying\nsomething about this, that,\nthe number of behaviors\nand thoughts and avoidance\nof behaviors and avoidance of thoughts\nthat human beings put in to trying\nand change the past.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- Is remarkable and eerie and maladaptive,\nit sounds like.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And that really stuck with me\nbecause I think we all want\nto feel like we're in control\nof our future and how\nwe feel in the moment.\nAnd to some extent, it\nworks for a brief while.\nThere's this thing that\nhappened and it's just,\nit evokes some internal arousal\nand then you have to know\nwhat to do with that arousal.\nAnd I think for many people,\nincluding myself, there's\nthis fundamental question.\nOkay, the thought about the\nthing, the event or events,\nplural, evokes this arousal,\nthis internal states, makes some people\nfeel sleepy and exhausted.\nOther people feel really anxious.\nOther people feel angry.\nI mean that arousal has all\nthese different dimensions\nas you know,\nand then there's this question\nof like what to do with it.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nAnd I'd love to hear a maybe even just\na top contour prescriptive of\nwhat do I, what does one do?\nI'll even just put myself\nin it, what do I do?\nSo I'm feeling upset about something.\nShould I feel like my options\nare healthy catharsis.\nI could tell the story, feel it.\nI could.\nI can pack it down.\nWe hear that it's bad to pack it down.\nBut of course one has\nto be functional in life\nand deal with things.\nAnd we have responsibilities at work\nand relational responsibilities, etcetera.\nWe need to sleep at night.\nSo catharsis, healthy catharsis,\npacking it down at the other extreme.\nTelling the story.\nAnd yet I think a lot of people\nare afraid to tell the story\nbecause in that telling\nthere is perhaps a\nreemergence of the arousal.\n- Yes.\n- The arousal can become greater, I mean.\n- Yes.\n- Is that what people mean when they say\nthings are going to get\nworse before they get better?\nI mean, so I guess,\nthe simple version of this\nlong-winded question is,\nit's clear we need to\nconfront these things.\nWe can't change the past by,\na reflexive response isn't\ngoing to do that efficiently.\nAnd so how do we deal with arousal?\nHow does one take what they feel\ninside about something shameful?\nWhat do you do with it in a moment?\nAnd does that have to be done\nin the presence of a skilled\ntrained therapist or\nas I'm driving to work\nin the morning and something comes up,\nI can't deal with this\nright now comes to mind,\nwhat do I do?\nDo I deal with it right then?\nI know this is a big\nmultidimensional question.\n- Yes.\n- But I think it's the one\nthat a lot of people grapple with.\nWe want to deal with things.\nHow do we deal with that internal arousal?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nWe so often try and change\nthe trauma of the past\nin order to control the future\nand what that really adds up\nto is the trauma of the past\ndominates our present, right?\nAnd it doesn't have to be that way.\nAnd remember, we're talking about traumas\nthat rise to the level\nof changing the brain.\nSo as you're saying,\nthat involves re-experience,\nit involves hyper vigilance,\nincreased arousal.\nIt changes in mood states,\nchanges in anxiety, changes in sleep,\nchanges in behavior.\nSo these are all changes that in a sense,\npush towards dominating\nour present, right?\nAnd then we're not really\nliving in the present, right.\nAs we're trying to control the future.\nWe're not going to do a great\njob of controlling our future\nif we're not really living\nin the present, right?\nAnd so the way to come at\nthat again in the moment,\nif we're saying, okay, in the moment,\nif I need to fall asleep, right?\nI might say, okay, let me try\nand put that out of my mind.\nLet me try and thought redirect.\nSo there's short term\nstrategies that can let us be\nfunctional in the\ncontext of these changes.\nBut the answer is to go look\ndirectly at that thing, right?\nLook at that trauma, explore\nthat trauma, and sure.\nThat can be done with a professional.\nAnd sometimes that's what makes sense,\nbut not always, right?\nSometimes it can be done\nby talking to another person, right?\nWriting it down, right?\nLook at what's going on inside of me,\nthat my mind is so stuck to this.\nLet's explore that because\nit's almost as if we're,\nwe're so afraid,\nso often of looking at the\ntrauma that has changed us,\nthat we'll look anywhere.\nBut at that, right?\nIt's like hidden in a closet\nand we'll shine the light everywhere else,\nbut we're not going to open that door.\nAnd that's where\npeople will say that same\nas I've heard over and over.\nAnd I myself have thought\nthis at times like, oh,\nif I talk about that,\nI'm going to start crying\nand never stop, right?\nOr I'm going to just fall apart, right?\nWhich is never what happens.\nNo one ever starts crying\nand never stops, right?\nWhat ends up happening\nis when the person puts\nwords to it, right?\nIt could be in writing,\nit could be talking to a trusted other\nor with a therapist, right?\nThings start to change.\nI mean, just the fact that\nyou can talk about it,\nyou can put words to it\nand other people don't recoil, right?\nI mean, how many times has someone said\nsomething for the first time, right?\nAnd when they're telling\nme about the trauma,\nthere's such an anxious,\nlike looking like as if I'm going to be,\nI'm going to recoil from it, right?\nMeaning I'm going to\nrecoil from them, right?\nAnd then there's a sense of\nsurprise if the person says,\nwell, you know, I was abused by\nthis coach when I was a kid, right?\nAnd there's not a, okay,\nthere's not a response of recoiling.\nYou can see the change and\npeople will say a lot, like, wow.\nLike, I can't believe like you can like,\nhear me say that and\nbe okay with it, right?\nI mean, so you think about\nwhat's going on inside of them.\nLike how, what a sense\nof shame, a sense of,\nthis is something awful about\nme for people to recoil from\nand it's just not true,\nbut here's where trauma\nis, it's insidious, right?\nAnd it's pervasive, right?\nBecause if that convinces us\nto continually hide it away,\nthen how do we explore it?\nThat example of the person who says, okay,\nI was abused by a coach\nwhen I was a child.\nI mean, I'm thinking of a\ncouple, very real cases, right?\nPeople that I've taken care of.\nAnd once they start talking about it,\nthen they start talking about how, ,\nthey were just innocent kids, right?\nAnd like, they didn't know.\nAnd like, they really\nwanted to be on the team\nwhere this coach was\ntreating them as special.\nAnd now they can look at\nthemselves from the outside, right?\nThey can look at themselves\nlike they would look\nat someone else, right?\nYou think it's so easy for us\nto see what's real and true,\nif it's someone else, right?\nIf you ask someone,\nwhat do you think of someone\nwho's 10, 11 years old,\nwho's abused and manipulated\nand abused by an adult?\nAnd you say, oh my goodness,\nI feel compassion for that person, right?\nBut if it's us right then, oh no,\nit's guilt and shame and\nwe have to hide it away.\nAnd when the person starts looking at it,\nthey can sort of see it from the outside.\nAnd it starts to take the\nenergy out of it, right?\nThen, well, who should\nfeel guilty about that?\nWho's done something wrong?\nAnd like, so now the\nconceptions come together,\nwhich is often a reflexive,\nthat was my fault.\nOh, I did it.\nI went back to it.\nI still stayed on the team.\nI went back next season, right?\nI let it happen again, right?\nAll the guilt and shame inside the person\ngets juxtaposed to like,\nwhat really happened there?\nAnd then they say, right.\nI was a terrified child, right?\nI didn't understand at all.\nAnd they can come to\na place of compassion.\nAnd now we are working\nagainst the guilt and shame.\nAnd if the person cries about\nit, then it's great, right?\nI mean, crying is one\nof the best coping mechanisms we have.\nIt doesn't hurt us.\nAnd it lets us grieve things.\nYeah, we can't grieve if there's guilt\nand shame inside of us,\nit just blocks grief, right?\nWe have to,\nthere has to be a clean slate\nin a sense in order to feel sadness.\nAnd then you see that it\nshifts from anxiety, anger,\nand frustration, usually\ndirected towards the self,\nthe guilt and shame towards,\ntowards being able to process\nit and being able to bring\nto bear some compassion\nand being able to direct\nthe negative emotions,\nso to speak where they're\nwarranted and my goodness,\nthe changes that happen.\nI mean, it's not like people\nare miraculously cured, right?\nBut it's remarkable how\njust getting it out there\nand having like one hour\nof talking like that,\nlike what we're talking about now\ncan leave a person\nfeeling immensely better.\n- It seems to me in hearing this,\nthat there's this weird\nwiring that we have,\nbecause what I'm hearing is\nwhen traumas happen to us\nor we observe them,\nwhat we need to do most\nis to confront those\nand the emotions around that directly.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nBut instead our system\ndefaults to guilt, shame.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And trying to hide it.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nAnd this repetition\ncompulsion of placing us back\ninto things similar to those traumas.\nOr even maybe even worse traumas.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- In an attempt to resolve it.\nIt's like the most maladaptive.\n- [Andrew] Wiring diagram.\nI could possibly think of.\n- Yes.\n- Emotional and presumably\nphysiological wiring diagram.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nAnd this notion of trying to change\nthe past by doing things now,\nwhen the exact opposite is\nwhat's going to be beneficial\nalso seems like the complete,\nthe whole system seems\ncompletely backwards.\nAnd I'm, I'm chuckling as I say this,\nnot because I'm amused it's\nbecause I'm just baffled once\nagain at how our wiring can\noften not serve us well.\nBut it raises an,\nwhat I think is an important\nand interesting question,\nwhich is earlier, you\nwere talking about how\npeople will seek out media\nthat's really disturbing.\nThey'll traumatize and\nre-traumatize themselves\non a daily basis.\nSo that could be viewed as\nthe repetition compulsion\nor the person will have\nthe same relationship\nwith seven different,\nsame abusive relationship\nwith seven different partners\nin sequence seems terrible.\nAnd yet,\nas I say this,\nit also is becoming clear\nto me how this almost seems\nlike a poor, but desperate attempt\nto resolve it in some way.\n- Yes.\n- And so the fork in the road,\nif I understand correctly,\nis to really get to the seed incident,\nreally get to the thing\nthat started it all,\nas opposed to repeating it all.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Does that have to be done in\nthe presence of a therapist?\nIs there a benefit to\ntaking a walk and thinking\nabout these things,\nbreaking down and crying,\nif that's what's necessary\nor feeling angrier,\nif that's what comes up?\nThe reason I ask it this\nway is because I worry,\nI'll just speak to my own experience,\nI worry that in reactivating\nor touching into the\nemotions around something\nthat is itself a form of\nthe repetition compulsion,\nbecause you're feeling it all over again.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- You're not seeking out\nsomething to evoke that feeling.\nSo I realize this is a little bit\nof a circular argument, right?\nOr question.\nBut I think it's one that\nI really struggle with\nin trying to parse all the,\nthe outcome based\ntherapies that I hear about\nand the recommendations that people make.\nI mean, how should we conceptualize this?\nSomething happens.\nSounds like we need to deal\nwith that thing directly.\nDo we need to do that with somebody else?\nCan we do that on our own?\nIf we're,\nwe don't have resources and\nwe have to do it on our own,\ncan't hire someone, can't\npay someone to work with us.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- How do we do that in a way\nthat isn't retraumatizing ourself\nin a major way, or in a minor way.\nHow do we know where we\nare in that landscape?\n- Right.\nAgain, those are, I\nthink, great questions.\nAnd I think it starts\nwith real introspection.\nWhen things are bouncing\naround in our minds,\noften, it's very, non-productive right?\nIt's the same thing over and over again,\nand that's not helpful for us, right?\nSo there's an idea which sometimes\ngets called an observing ego, right?\nThe ability to stop and look\nat what's going on inside of ourselves.\nAnd so if we're just thinking about it\nand we're thinking in the same way,\nwe sort of, in a sense,\nalways think about it,\nthen all we're doing is\nreinforcing the trauma, right?\nBut if we can distance\nenough to be like, huh, it's,\nI'm interested in what's\ngoing on inside of me, right?\nI can think of a certain person\nwho really loves music.\nI mean, and at some point\nin our therapy work,\nI learned like she was taking long drives,\nbut the, the radio wasn't on.\nAnd I was like, well,\nwhat what's going on, right?\nAnd I asked,\nand what was going on\nis she was running over\nand over again in her head, like,\nI'm a loser, I'm a loser, right?\nAnd she didn't want the music\non because the music would\ndrown out what she felt she\nhad to say to herself, right?\nAnd it was that like, wow,\nthat's interesting, right?\nAnd then her ability to\nobserve that and to think,\nwhy am I doing that when\nit comes into her mind?\nLike, what does that trace to,\nwhen did I start doing that?\nLike I say, you know,\nI'm saying it for a point\nof exaggeration, we're like,\nnobody comes out of the womb\nprogrammed to think I'm a loser, right?\nSo we don't think that\nwhen we're born, right?\nSo where does that come from?\nThen, we can think in ways\nthat allow us to have new thoughts, right?\nThat we weren't having,\nIt's not just bouncing\naround in our minds.\nAnd if we speak or write,\nthere are even more mechanisms\nthat come online in our brains, right?\nThat are then sort of\nmonitoring mechanisms.\nWe think in a different way,\nif we're using words, right?\nAnd we are better able often\nto bring in that observing ego,\nlike what's going on inside of me?\nSo it can be very helpful to think,\nit can be helpful to talk to someone,\nto a trusted other, you\nknow, friend, family,\nclergy to write, I mean,\nthese are things that can be done\nwithout expending any resources, right?\nAnd sometimes it can make\nreally a big difference, right?\nIt was a way, when did\nI start thinking that?\nAnd like, interestingly,\nin this case, okay,\nwe did it in therapy,\nbut it became very clear what\nthat was rooted to, right?\nAnd then in the therapy,\nwhich was still relatively young,\nbut we'd done several sessions\nand we weren't talking at all\nabout what we needed to talk about, right?\nBut that's what got us to\nwhat we needed to talk about.\nAnd when did that start,\nand now we're in that same\nplace of exploring that\nand what was the reflex to it\nand the sense of guilt and sense of shame.\nAnd it's where all of that came from\nthat just got boiled down\nto I'm a loser, right?\nWhich this person didn't\neven have in their mind.\nLike, I didn't think about\nmyself that way, right?\nAnd that's is so interesting, right?\nThat our memories don't in\nand of themselves have meaning\nit's like they're flat\nor colorless, right?\nAnd they're colored in by the emotions\nthat we attach to them, right?\nSo, the idea that certain memories now,\nbefore the trauma were changed, right?\nBy the trauma.\nSo I tell the story,\nsometimes of a person\nwho like won an award\nwhen they were in high\nschool that they thought was,\noh my gosh, like it shows,\nlike I can do it, right?\nI get out there, that after trauma,\nthey saw the award with the\nnegative emotion attached to it.\nThat was like, oh,\nit was given to me and\nI didn't deserve it.\nAnd almost it was mocking.\nLike, it was going to be the\ngreatest achievement in my life\nand I was 17 or so, and to\nhave someone think like,\nthat's not how they felt\nabout that at the time.\nIt's the trauma that\nchanged, the self talk,\nthe internal state going forward\nand talking about miraculous\nin a negative way,\nalso changed that going backward, right?\nAnd when we can really look at that,\nlike where did that come from?\nAnd we can start\nunraveling it, it changes.\nSo in those cases, you\nknow, often it's helpful\nto have a good therapist,\nit's not always necessary.\nAnd it certainly, it's not\nalways possible, right?\nSo we need other strategies.\nAnd some of those,\nI write about some of those in the book\nof how can we sort of get at trauma\nwithout those formalized mechanisms.\nAnd sometimes if the symptoms\nare significant enough,\nlike we really do need to\ntalk to somebody professional\nwho can help us get to\nthe root of the trauma.\nAnd there's so many times,\nthat's the answer to what's\ngoing on with people.\nPeople I've seen have had\nfive residential stays.\nI'm not exaggerating this,\nfor mental health reasons,\nfor substance reasons,\nand no one's ever taken\na trauma history, right?\nAnd then when you take a\ntrauma history, you say,\nwell, that's obviously where\nthis is all coming from, right?\nLike that's when the drug\nuse started truly thereafter,\nthe negative self talk\nand the negative feelings\nthat led to the drug use.\nThen you go after the trauma\nand you can change things.\nWhereas trying to change\nthings without looking,\nintrospecting, talking about the trauma,\nI think of course was futile.\n- Do you think that people\ncan start to have negative fantasies?\nI mean, you mentioned this woman\nwho would take these long\ndrives to berate herself.\nI'm not familiar with that, but I'll,\nI'll give a little bit of\npersonal disclosure here.\nI've felt several times in my life\nthat I will start to create a narrative\nabout something that truly hasn't happened\nabout something terrible\nthat somebody is going to do.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- That's going to upset me.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And for the longest time,\nI wonder why am I doing this?\nAnd I have a couple ideas about why, one,\nis that I was attempting\nto just avoid thinking\nabout other things.\nIt's just, you know, anger is such\nan attractive emotional force in this.\nIt's an attracting, it's not attractive.\nWe don't like it.\nAnd yet, oftentimes anger is a great way\nto replace feeling something else.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Feeling sad or having to come up\nor to do work or to do something useful.\nSo it has this kind of a like\ngravitational force to it.\nThat was one idea.\nThe other idea was in imagining\nkind of worst outcomes,\nthen actually that relationship were,\ncould actually seem a\nlot better in reality.\n- Hm hm.\n- [Andrew] It's almost like\ncreating this negative contrast.\n- Yes.\nIt's like, oh, well\nthen it's not that bad.\nAnd then the third possibility\nis I have no idea why,\nbut it seemed like a reflex.\nAnd I spent some time thinking about it.\nI can't say I've resolved it completely,\nbut why would somebody\nhave a narrative or a default\nnarrative when driving\nor when walking of I'm just\ngoing to spend some time\nand think about how terrible\nthis thing is going to turn out\nor how someone's going to upset me\nor harm me or how terrible I am.\nIt seems, again, like\nmaladaptive thinking,\nmaladaptive wiring.\nAnd yet I have to assume\nthat it serves some purpose.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nI mean, I think there are three factors\nthere and they're all bad.\nAnd I think you spoke to at\nleast two of them, right?\nThey I think speak so powerfully\nto how insidious trauma\nis and how these are real\nbrain changes inside of us.\nSo I would say that the\nthree factors, punishment,\navoidance and control, right?\nSo the trauma inside of us,\nthat makes guilt and shame.\nSo often, so often leads\nto a desire to punish oneself, right?\nAnd the idea that, oh, that was my fault.\nOr I deserve that.\nWell, what do we do if something\nis someone's fault and someone\nnow deserves punishment, right?\nI mean, we we punish them, right?\nWe send 'em to jail, we\ngive them a fine, right?\nWe punish them.\nAnd so what, what we do is\npunish ourselves, right?\nAnd if we tell ourselves we're a loser\nor this awful thing is\ngoing to happen, right?\nThen part of what we're\ndoing is saying to ourselves,\nsee, right, you deserve that.\nYou're not going to have\nanything better, right?\nIt's a negative.\nIt's a very negative\nway that the brain tries\nto make us in a sense,\nto do better by hurting\nus more for the things\nthat we couldn't and\nshouldn't have been able to,\nweren't expected to control\nin the first place, right?\nThe second is distraction.\nAs you said, anger,\nthat kind of fantasy can distract us\nfrom affect feeling and emotion.\nThat can be much more negative.\nAnger, it can be more gratifying\nthan certainly than guilt or shame,\nalthough guilt or shame can\nserve a punishment purpose.\nBut if anger is directed also\ntowards ourselves, right,\nthen it can serve punishment too.\nSo punishment, avoidance,\nand the sense of control\nthat if you think ahead\nto something awful,\nthat you're imagining is going to happen,\nwell, maybe that will\nlet you avoid it, right?\nI mean, you can see the\nbrain here in a sense,\nreally confused.\nI mean, part of the brain wants to punish.\npart of the brain doesn't\nwant to think about it at all\nand part of the brain\nwants to make it better.\nAnd then how all of that resolves,\nif we're not aware that,\nhey, this is in the context of our brains\nbeing deeply impacted by trauma.\nSo what's going on here\nis all maladaptive, right?\n'Cause these negative\nfantasies of the future,\nthey may help us feel better\nabout something in the present,\nbut they don't help us make\nanything better, right?\nThey don't help us make anything better.\nSo this is kind of the sequela.\nThis is where trauma and\nall this reflexive stuff\nthat happens after trauma\nultimately lead us.\nAnd you can see how we get lost,\nhow I've seen over and\nover again in my own life,\nin the lives of other people,\nhow man we get stuck in those situations\nand that's why I see people sometimes.\nThis has been going on for\n30 years, 40 years, right?\nAnd it's just been going on\nover and over and over again\nbecause there's no natural\nend to any of this, right?\nUnless we,\nwe look at it in a different way,\nthat we have knowledge and\ninformation like, whoa,\nthis isn't the way it has to be.\nLet me bring a novel perspective to this.\nIt doesn't change on its own.\n- I'm struck by your statement\nthat these thoughts or behaviors\ncan make us feel better,\nbut they don't actually\nmake anything better.\nIn that way,\nthis mode of imagining terrible outcomes\nstarts to immediately\nseem like taking opioids.\nYou feel better in the moment,\nbut it doesn't actually\nmake anything better.\nAnd it probably makes things worse.\n- Yes.\n- And just a question of how much worse\nand in what direction, yes.\nAnd so I just want to just\npause on that concept,\nbecause I think that concept\nof makes us feel better,\nbut doesn't make anything better.\nI think it answers an earlier question\nabout what seems to be a totally\nmaladaptive wiring diagram.\nWe need to confront the thing,\nbut we don't want to go into\nthe repetition compulsion.\nSo it's a knife edge there,\nto navigate through trauma.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Working with a very skilled\nclinician like yourself,\nI think is the ideal\ncircumstance for people.\nAnd of course there are people\nwho can't access support\nfrom somebody, for whatever reason.\nYou've talked about journaling.\n- Hmm, yes.\n- As a useful tool.\nCould you maybe highlight\nsome of the other things that\npeople can do on their own.\nAnd then I'd also like to talk about\nwhat makes for a good therapist.\nWhat should people look for\nfor those that are seeking therapy,\nespecially nowadays when a lot of therapy\nis being done remotely, but\nlet's just start with the,\nlet's just call them self-generated\nor zero cost sorts of things,\njournaling being the first\nand then what are some of the others\nand what kind of structure\nwould you recommend\nsomeone put around journaling,\ncarry a journal around all\nday and jot things down\nas they come up or sit down\nand spend an hour writing\nin complete sentences,\nfor instance.\n- Yeah.\nIf I could add something\nto what you had just said\nbefore the question, right?\nThat we have these short-term\ncoping mechanisms in us, right?\nAnd in a way it makes sense, right?\nIf we find ourselves in\njust terrible situations,\nthen a short-term coping mechanism\ncan get us through them, right?\nSo our brains are built that way\nand that's part of survival too, right?\nAnd whether now in the modern\nworld, whether it's food,\nit's drugs, it's sex, it's alcohol, right?\nOr it's negative thoughts, right?\nThis is short-term soothing.\nEven the negative thoughts,\nAnd anger is short-term soothing\nat the expense of long-term change, right?\nAnd that's where addictive\npathways can come into play.\nAnd that's where, again, our,\nhow we're built\nevolutionarily for survival,\ndoesn't help us, you know, in\nthe way humans have evolved.\nLike we haven't lived this way throughout,\n99.9% something percent\nof human history, right?\nSo we're not adapted to this.\nSo I want to just make a point of saying\nthat about the short-term soothing\nat the expense of any of long-term change,\nAnd then the question you had\nasked about say journaling\nor what can we do that's\noutside of professional.\nI think the hallmark of it\nhas to be bringing new eyes to it, right?\nLike thinking about self with a curiosity,\ninstead of just a simple\nautomaticity or repetition, right?\nLike, why am I thinking about this?\nWhen did this start?\nWhy is this in me?\nRight?\nWhether it's words or\nwhether we're writing,\nthat's so important.\nSo I think for journaling,\nit depends on the person.\nI mean, we don't want\nsomebody carrying around\na journal all day,\nif then there's a compulsion to,\nI need to write about everything\nthat's going on in my mind, right?\nLike that might be good to okay.\nWrite a little bit at night, right?\nOr someone who might think,\nsometimes this really comes\ninto my mind in a strong way\nand it could be unpredictable, right?\nI want to have the journal with me.\nSo, ah, that thing is back in my mind now,\nlet me write about it, right?\nBecause then putting words to it\nand then being able to\nread those words, right?\nAnd when people read,\neven do a little bit of journaling\nand they read like, oh,\nI thought again about\nhow I'm a terrible person\nwho can't have a good life,\nbecause I was in such a bad car accident\nor because that person attacked me\nor because when I was in school,\nI was bullied because I looked different\nthan everyone else, right?\nOr acted different from everyone else.\nWow, to actually see that written out.\nIt's a little bit of that,\nit's a little bit of that.\nLike when you're saying it to someone\nas if it were someone else, right?\nBecause now there's\nenough distance from it.\nLike I'm looking at the\nwords I wrote, right?\nThat we get some distance\nand we can start to integrate\nsome of the, not just the compassion,\nbut integrating compassion\nand logic, right?\nOf like, okay.\nI feel a sense of compassion\nnow, wait, what does this mean?\nWhat really happened here, right?\nAnd gosh, I did start thinking\ndifferently after that.\nI started, that's where\nthis came from, right?\nThat's why I'm saying this,\nit's those kind of\nrevelations that we can have\nthrough again, the written or spoken word.\nAnd I think again, that\ninvolves a trusted other,\nor writing, right?\nAnd I think that those\nare ways we can do this,\nwhere we bring some de novo\nperspective to something\nthat often has been bouncing\naround inside of us.\nAnd it's amazing to me that,\nI can see such intelligent\nempathically, attuned people\nwho've had the same thing\nrunning over and over again\nin their mind for years.\nAnd it just points out that our brains\ndon't automatically\nsay, hey, wait a second.\nI've been spinning wheels\nhere for a long, long time.\nLike, was there another\nway to look at this?\nWe need something from the outside,\nwhich can just be knowledge, right?\nWhich is why I think what we're doing here\nor the reason I wrote the\nbook that I wrote was like,\napprehending this like\namazing surprise to me, right?\nWhich is like, wow,\nlike some huge percentage\nof everything I'm treating\nis rooted in trauma and the\nopacity of trauma, right?\nWhich is why we don't see\nthat, oh, the depression,\nthe panic attacks, the\nlife change, the addiction,\nthe maladaptive choices like, oh,\nthis is all coming from\ntrauma because it hides itself\nin that opacity.\nSo we need a de novo perspective\nif we're doing it on our own.\nAnd we need that if we're\ndoing it in therapy,\nwhich might link like finding\nthe right therapist, right?\nWhich is also part of your question.\n- Yeah, yeah I definitely want to know\nabout how to assess and\nfind the right therapist.\nBefore we cover that, however,\nsomething came up in the\ncourse of your answer.\nI can immediately relate to this idea that\ncertain behaviors are really maladaptive\nand are stuffing things\ndown or avoiding the topic\nis problematic and bringing a curiosity\nand an introspection and\nalmost a third personing\nof the experience\nthat we've had in order\nto try and address it\nfrom a new, truly from a new perspective.\nIt occurred to me as we\nwere discussing this,\nhowever that some people, and yes,\nmaybe I'm talking a little\nbit about my own experience.\nWe have a sense of our own identity\nand how people view us and\nour ability to be functional\nin the world in ways that we like,\neffective at work or a good brother\nor a good mother or father,\nhuman being in the world.\nWe have relationships.\nAnd I think that one\nthing that I have heard,\nand maybe I've experienced\nis that sometimes those\nmaladaptive thoughts or behaviors,\nthe things that generate a kind\nof a repetition of anger\nor of arousal or activation\nor sadness, that we have\nsome internal process\nwhere we funnel that into a\nfunctionality in the world.\nSo we I'll give a more concrete example.\nSo in thinking about things\nthat have upset me in the past\nand in imagining bad\noutcomes in the future,\nthere's a certain\ninternal state of arousal\nthat comes about.\nAnd for many years, I\nwas able to use that,\nnot to feel angry,\nbut rather to work an\nextra three hours a day\n- [Paul] Right.\n- Or to pack my schedule with\nwork and social engagement.\nSo I could show up in a way that I,\nhopefully was a very good brother\nto my sister for instance.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- So in a way it was a,\nit was a transformation\nof something negative\ninside of me.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Into a functionality in the world\nthat was actually very\nrewarding and beneficial.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And yet in describing it,\nI can immediately see how it\nwould be wonderful if I could\nsource from something else.\n- [Paul] Hm- hm.\n- And yet I, you can imagine,\nand I can imagine how\none would be reluctant,\nmaybe even terrified of\ngiving up that source.\n- Yes.\n- [ Andrew] It's a fuel.\n- Yes.\nand I think in knowing some\nof the traumas of other people\nand their reluctance\nto work through those,\nobviously I'm not a therapist,\nI sense this over and over again,\nthat one's positive identity\ncan often be linked to something\ndifficult in their past.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And so people are reluctant\nto give up this fuel.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Because it it's in that\nsense, it's functional.\nThe only thing that allowed\nme to kind of start to address\nthis and why I'm still\nso curious about this,\n'cause I don't think I've worked\nthrough this process completely,\nagain, a little more\nself-disclosure there,\nis that I was told that these words,\njust imagine how much better it would be\nif you could source from a different fuel,\na fuel that felt better.\n- Right.\n- Maybe it was on the, it was on this,\nthis sentence.\nIt was, maybe you could actually be\nmuch more effective.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Maybe you could be 10\ntimes the better brother.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Maybe you could have 10 times\nmore insight or work capacity, etcetera.\nSo it's on that hint of a promise that I,\nat least I was inspired to\nstart looking into these things\nand reading about trauma\nin your book and elsewhere,\nand start to think about this.\nSo again, I realize this\nis a long winded question\nand a somewhat complex idea, but I think,\nor I hope that people will\nbe able to resonate with this\nidea that sometimes we\nwant to stay attached\nto this short term soothing\nthat the punishment\ndistraction or control\nbecause it evokes this arousal\nand then we can apply that arousal.\n- Yes, yes.\nI think what you're describing maps\nI think clinically to what\ngets called sublimation.\nSo there's something\nnegative inside of us,\nbut we sort of transfer that energy,\nwe transfer that into something\nthat is adaptive or\nthat is positive, right?\nSo the idea of the anger, right?\nWhen I think of that thing\nand it makes anger in me,\nI channel that into harder work, right?\nOr I channel that into like,\nI'm going to go be nicer\nto my brothers, some right,\nsomething like that.\nAnd there's validity to that, right?\nBut it can become like self\njustifying if a person thinks,\nwell, look at what this\nis doing for me, right?\nI wouldn't work as hard without it.\nRight now we start to become\nattached to the trauma.\nWhereas I think what you\nhad said is absolutely true\nthat just because we can sublimate\nsome of the negative\naffect, feeling, emotion\nthat comes from trauma into something\nproductive doesn't mean\nthat that's best, right?\nI mean we can get to our destination\nby taking a very circuitous route, right?\nWe might waste an hour getting\nthere, but we get there.\nThat doesn't mean that that's best.\nAnd it also doesn't look\nat all the negative, right?\nIn this example, the wasted\nfuel, the wasted time, right?\nWe get somewhere, but\nwe are not optimizing.\nAnd I have yet to see one person\nwho has addressed the trauma\nand become less functional, right?\nIt's always either,\nthey're just as functional,\nbut they're happier, right?\nOr more functional\nbecause as you said, like,\njust because we may be\nable to sublimate, well,\nmaybe what's going on will\nbe 10 times better, right?\nIf we weren't sublimating\nbecause the sublimation limits us, right?\nIt limits our perspective\nto only what we can see\nand do through the lens of the trauma.\nAnd that is never better\nthan the alternative.\n- Thank you for that.\n- Yeah, you're welcome, yeah.\n- Let's discuss how one could\nor should go about finding\na really good therapist.\nTypically in my experience,\nthis is done by word of mouth.\nThere's this person you\nmight want to work with them\nand they're really great,\nbut what are some of the characteristics\nthat one should look for?\nAnd should we take into account whether\nor not we are a person who for instance,\nI've heard this from listeners,\nalthough I'm clearly,\nI'm definitely not talking about myself\nhere in cloaking something.\nSome people will say,\nI want to work with a somatic\ntherapist because I've actually\nheard someone say, I think in fields,\nI feel stuff in my body.\nSo I want to work with someone\nwho can really acknowledge that\nor someone else will say,\nI want to work with somebody\nwho has this orientation\nor that orientation or is open\nto my particular lifestyle,\nor isn't going to tell me that\nI have to leave my relationship.\nI feel like people already\nshow up to the question\nof who to work with with\nall these, you know,\nthings internally,\nsome of which are voiced\nand some of which aren't.\nSo I'd love for you to talk\nabout maybe some of the,\nthe core features of a\nreally good therapist\nand then how to look for a therapist.\nAnd also how to think about oneself\nin looking for a therapist.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- Because of these kind\nof predispositions.\n- [Paul] Right, right.\nWell, there's a lot of data about this\nover the years,\nif you look at what are the top 10\nimportant factors to find in a therapist,\njust repeat rapport 10 times, right?\nI mean, that's the key.\nAnd if you think about that,\nit's pretty amazing, right?\nBecause therapeutic modalities\ncan be so different, right?\nAnd I think what that's\ntelling us is, in a way,\nsomething very obvious, right?\nLike what does rapport mean?\nLike, you know, it's somebody\nthat's paying attention, right?\nIt's trust, it's a back and forth.\nIt's like, yeah. even though\nI'm doing something difficult,\nI'm doing it with someone\nwho's really helping me,\nsomeone who's in it with me, right?\nSomeone who's really paying attention.\nWants me to be better.\nThat's indispensable, I mean,\nit's just indispensable.\nAnd I write in the book is someone,\na therapist not making eye contact\nor this is the way they do it, right?\nAnd you know,\nyou got to fit into the\nbox of the way they do it.\nThat is not going to be helpful.\nAnd then what I,\nwhat I think about that is\nthe different modalities.\nIt doesn't actually tell us that,\noh, the modalities are irrelevant.\nI think that's not true.\nI think that good therapists\nare not pigeonholed\nby a certain modality.\nThey may come at the world largely\nthrough a psychodynamic\nor a CBT or a DBT lens.\nThere's lots of different,\nways to do therapy.\nBut when you really talk to those people,\nreally good experience therapists,\nit's all coming through\nthe vehicle of the rapport,\nbut they're practically shifting\nto what the person needs.\nI don't understand the idea that like, oh,\nI just do this, right?\nI don't do that.\nAnd when people are pigeonholed that way,\nI don't think they help their\npatients very well, right?\nWe have to be diverse enough to say, hey,\nI want all the arrows\nin the quiver, right?\nAnd even though there might\nbe one that I favor and that's\nthe lens I see things through,\nno, I can be versatile, I can shift,\nI can adapt to what this person needs.\nAnd I think if you have\nthat, you've got to,\nif you have that, you've\ngot a winning combination.\n- Great, so people should\nperhaps try a few therapists\nand maybe have a session or\ntwo or three to see if they,\nthe rapport feels like it's taking root.\nIs that?\n- [Paul] Yeah.\n- Do you have that right?\n- Yeah, and I think that's why word\nof mouth is important, right?\nIf someone you trust tells you,\nhey, this is a good person\nthat says a lot, right?\nIt already makes the pretest probability,\nis quite high.\nBut yes, it's interesting to see\nwhen like people have a therapist\nor they called their insurance\nand they're assigned a therapist.\nThis thought that like, oh,\nthat's the person I have to have now.\nAnd it's like, no, you should look at that\nlike anyone you'd be interviewing, right,\nfor a job, right?\nBut you got to bring again,\nthe right set of thoughts\nto that to be helped, right?\nWhich is that I want someone\nwho has rapport with me.\nI don't want someone who's\ngoing to make it easy, right?\nWho's like, well, it's,\ngosh, it's kind of pleasant,\nbecause then that means\nthey're not talking\nabout the difficult things, right?\nSo if one brings, like, I know\nthis isn't going to be easy.\nI got to talk about\ndifficult things, right?\nEven if one doesn't recognize\nor I got to talk about\nthe trauma in me, right?\nBut to go to therapy\nthinking, no, it's, I mean,\nsometimes it's enjoyable,\nbut a lot of times, right,\nit's not, right?\nIt's hard work.\nIt can be excruciating.\nWe can cry during it, but to say,\nright, that that's how\nI'm going to be helped.\nAnd I want someone who's\ngoing to do that with me,\nwho's really looking at,\nwhat's going on inside of me,\nhow do we help me?\nAnd I can feel sort of\nthe robustness of that.\nIf one brings that approach\nand then looks at the therapist\nthrough that lens,\nyou're very likely to\nthen move on from someone\nwho's not a good choice, right?\nAnd really stick with someone who is,\neven though that doesn't mean\nit's always like pleasant\nand enjoyable.\nI mean, it has to not be that sometimes.\n- Right.\nMaybe we could drill a little deeper\ninto the mechanics of therapy.\nI put out a few questions to\naudience asking what they want\nto know about therapy and it was amazing.\nI got hundreds, if not\nthousands of responses saying,\nhow should I show up to therapy?\nSo for instance,\nshould people take a five minute\nmeditative drop in before?\nOr should they just show\nup cold and let it emerge.\nDuring therapy,\nis it a good idea to take notes\nor to not take notes\nand then post therapy,\nhow should clients,\npatients as they're sometimes\ncalled, one or the other,\nI never know which,\nhow should they process that information?\nShould they take some\ndesignated time afterwards\nand in an ideal world,\ntake a 30 minute walk\nafterwards and think about\nthe material or should they set it aside\nand come back to it?\nOf course there are constraints,\nwork and family, etcetera.\nBut you know we,\nthere's a lot of knowledge out\nthere about how to best show\nup to a workout, warm\nup for five, 10 minutes,\nthen do this, etcetera\nand then the cool down.\nI mean, here, we're talking\nabout hard psychological work\naimed at bettering oneself.\nSo to my knowledge,\nI've not ever seen this\ninformation anywhere.\nIt'd be very useful to hear,\nhear your thoughts on this.\n- Yeah.\nWell, I'm not trying to duck the question,\nbut I think it varies so much by person.\nSo if you think about the\nfirst part of your question,\nI think was how to show\nup to therapy, right?\nAnd I think the answer would be whatever\nlets you be fully present\nwhen you're in therapy.\nNow for some people that's\ngoing to be, I show up early,\nI say it, I call myself,\nI meditate a little bit.\nI mean, that's how then\nthey're present, right?\nFor other people, you know,\nthey just, they show up,\nwalk into the room, they can\nstop another present, right?\nSo it's whatever works for that person.\nSo that they're really\nthere, their thoughts,\ntheir energy is really in what's going on.\nAnd the same thing\napplies on the other end.\nThere are people who are\nreally well served by,\ngoing for a walk if they can,\nor sitting quietly after therapy,\nkind of putting that in order, right?\nOtherwise they lose some of it, right?\nOr like some of the ahas, right?\nOr the, oh, that's an interesting thought\nthat they really need to put it in order.\nMaybe that involves taking some\nnotes during therapy, right?\nFor other people, they need\nto do the exact opposite.\nThey need to like leave,\nnot think about that at all.\nAnd then they can reflect on\nit later and learn from it.\nSo we're so different.\nHuman beings, there's\nsuch a diversity in us\nthat there's no hard answer to that,\nbut it's like being present\nwhen it's happening,\nthen being able to sort of consolidate\nand retain what's been\ngained is most important.\nAnd I think we have to figure\nthat out person by person.\nI mean, I try and do\nthat in the work of like\nwhat's serving this person best.\nAnd sometimes we,\nsometimes it evolves and\nsometimes we talk about it,\nbut it varies so much.\n- Hmm.\n- If someone were thinking about embarking\non therapy or more therapy\nto address trauma or just\ngeneral issues of life,\nwhat is the frequency that you recommend?\nI could imagine two extreme models.\nOne is, okay,\nI'm going to finally tackle this trauma.\nI'm going to do therapy\nthree times a week,\nbut for a shorter period\nof time, six months,\nover and out versus this open\nended model of once a week,\ntypically for as long as it takes.\n- Right, right.\nI think that also varies.\nAnd I work with people\nin varied ways from oh,\nsomeone who's doing well\nand like we meet for a half\nhour every six months, right?\nTo doing week long,\nhourly sessions, to\nspending three intense days\nwith someone in a row, right?\nSo I think as far as like\nkind of guiding principles,\nwhat I have found in my own life,\n'cause I value my own\ntherapy tremendously.\nSo I found in my own life\nand in my own clinical work\nthat if it's less than once a week,\nthen it's hard for us to retain really.\nWe spend a lot of time\nkind of catching up, okay,\nwhat's happened?\nLet's get back to the place\nwe were at before, right?\nWhich is why I think if we're\nreally going to get somewhere,\nwe're not just trying to\nmaintain something, right?\nThen I think once a week for an hour\nis really kind of the minimum, right?\nBut more intensive work.\nIt's like the more I intense it is,\nit's not linear, right?\nIt's an exponential gain.\nLike we do a lot of intensive work, right?\nwhere someone will come\nand do 30 clinical hours\nwith us over the course of a week.\nSo five or six different\nclinicians, 30 clinical hours.\nAnd you know,\nwe've found that the benefits\nof doing that are immense.\nIt's like let's say a year's worth\nof therapy consolidated and\nyou take well, 30 hours,\nlet's say, we go almost every week,\nmaybe that's 45 or 50 hours,\nbut 30 hours with that kind of intensity\nis worth probably 60 hours,\ndone in a different way,\nbecause then it's in us\nin an active way, right?\nIt's in the therapist in an active way,\nit becomes very, very dynamic.\nSo I think turning up the intensity,\nif there's something that\nwe really need to process,\nabsolutely makes sense.\nAnd I do that in my own life\nis something now's\nlike, whoa, it's really,\nsomebody is really distressing me\nand it's linking into prior trauma\nand I can see what's going on in me.\nNow I start to have\nruminative thoughts, you know,\nwith negativity, I'm like,\nI got to go more, right?\nBecause I got to do that processing.\nSo I can get to the place that I am,\nwhich is not that,\nit's not that the trauma\nhas no impact on me, right?\nIt' that the impact is much\nless than it was before\nthe therapy and that I most often\nand more often than not\nhave an ability to see\nwhen it's now intruding into my thoughts.\nAnd it's taking me away from like\nwhat I really think and believe,\nor being able to draw\nlogic and emotion together\nand make good decisions.\nTurning up the intensity\nthen absolutely makes sense.\n- This very deep, intensive\nwork of 30 hours in a week.\nWhat brings somebody to some,\nthe type of work of that sort?\nIs it a suicide risk or a\nsevere addiction situation?\nI mean, how does one\ngauge how much therapy\nthey ought to be doing\nand should it always be\non the therapist to decide that frequency?\nWhat would bring someone\nto a situation of five\ntherapists in 30 hours\na week in one week?\n- Right, right.\nYeah, it's usually a person\nwho is really distressed\nby something whether that's,\nit's so negatively impacting their life\nor sometimes a person\ncomes to realization.\nI just can't take this anymore, right?\nI'm sick of the cyclical depression.\nI got to stop having panic attacks.\nI need help, right?\nBut it's usually some,\ncrisis point with the idea\nof crisis in the meaning of,\nokay, something comes\nto a head and after it,\nthings are going to be different, right?\nNot a crisis and things are\ngoing to be negative afterwards,\nbut a point where, where then\nthat cognitive flexibility\ncomes to the fore of like,\nwell, I need to do\nsomething different, right?\nSo that's often what brings us.\nSometimes it's other\npeople pointing it out\nor somebody's had an\nintervention somewhere or yes,\nthat person's been hospitalized\nafter a suicide attempt\nor they've gone back to\nrehab again for the third or fourth time.\nAnd their life is really in danger.\nSometimes it's that.\nAnd sometimes it's a person\nrealizing, yeah, I just want to,\nI want to look at myself, I want\nto understand myself better.\nI know that what's going on in me,\nisn't as good as it can be, right?\nSo I think people can come to it\nfor all sorts of different ways.\nAnd I think, yes,\nI think a lot of times it\nwould be the therapist to say,\nmore work, more intensive\nwork or can make a difference.\nBut I think the person also needs to,\ntake ownership, right?\nOf their own therapy and say,\nif I don't feel helped enough,\nwell, I have to think about that, right?\nAnd talk to the therapist\nabout that, 'cause it,\nmaybe that therapist isn't a match, right?\nOr maybe you talk to the\ntherapist and the therapist\ncan change his or her approach, right?\nOr maybe you talk to the therapist\nand increase the frequency, right?\nBut the idea is to be aware of it, right?\nAnd if one's needs,\naren't being met to\nacknowledge that, right?\n'Cause people can get\ninto a rhythm of therapy\nwhere it's really not helping them, right?\nBut they either feel sort\nof nihilistic about it.\nLike, oh, I'm no better and\nI'm going to therapy, right?\nOr sometimes there's a sense\nthat while I'm in therapy,\nso I'm kind of checking\nthat box of doing something\nfor myself, but it's not\nreally getting me anywhere.\nAnd then the part of the\nbrain that's controlled\nby the guilt and shame and avoidance\nthinks that's a great idea, right?\nSo again, this ability\nto observe ourselves\nand like what's going on,\nam I being helped in the way,\ndo I feel helped, right?\nAm I in some ways,\neven like happy that\nI'm not feeling helped.\n'Cause I don't have to face\nthis thing I don't want to face, right?\nOr am I too afraid to say\nI need more help, right?\nDo we really need to look at ourselves?\nAnd this is where the insurance systems\noften are very difficult,\n'cause it's hard sometimes\nfor a person to say,\nI need more therapy 'cause that\nmay not be possible, right?\nSo there are sort of negative factors\nin the world around us.\nBut ultimately I think the\nanswer to the question comes down\nto observing ourselves\nand taking ownership\nof like what's going on in\nus and how we're feeling.\nAnd then feeling that,\nthat commitment to self\nor to self-care to say,\nI need to go change this.\n- And for those that\nmaybe don't have the means\nor insurance or access to do even one day\na week therapy in the journaling model.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Could one perhaps take an entire day\nas awful as it might seem,\nto do a lot of journaling\nand thinking and walking,\ndo a self-generated intensive.\nDo you think there's utility to that?\n- I mean there could be,\nbut again it depends by person 'cause\nthere could also be\nsomething negative about that\nif it's someone who's not at the point,\nnot ready for that, right?\nI mean we don't come at,\nwe don't come directly at\nthe trauma immediately,\nat least most of the time\nwe don't do that, right?\nAnd we often don't explore it in depth.\nLike this idea that, oh,\nthat person now has to go through\nevery second of the trauma\nis actually not true.\nI mean sometimes it is, but that's,\nthat's not the common situation, right?\nSo more often that\nperson has to acknowledge\nlike the example of like\nI was sexually abused\nand have to acknowledge\nthat and to, and say,\nokay, like, gosh,\nwhat has that done to me?\nThat doesn't mean,\nwell let's parse out every moment\nof like how that was and\nthe terror of that, right?\nSo that can lead people\nto a worse place, right?\nSo, I think the idea of\nbiting off small pieces,\nso to speak where a\nperson is writing, right?\nOr is talking.\nBut I think if one is writing,\nit is good to communicate\nwith another, right?\nAnother trusted person.\nAnd if there's not someone\nin one's personal life,\nthere are clergy members,\neven if one isn't a affiliated\nwith an organized religion,\nyou could probably go places\nand get clergy to want to help you, right?\nI mean, there are people out there\nwho want to help other people.\nSo we say, what if someone\nhas no one, I mean,\nalmost never do we have\nno one here, right?\n'Cause we could probably go find someone,\nbut we need to kind of\ntake that in pieces.\nSo there's some risk like trying\nto do the intensive thing,\nyou know, on one's own.\nAnd that's where I would put in,\nif a person's having suicidal thoughts\nor even thoughts of death,\nof not wanting to be alive,\nI don't deserve to be alive.\nI mean, these are warning\nsigns for really getting help.\nSo there are some signs that say, hey,\ndon't try and do that on your own, right?\nGo try and find a resource.\nAnd it's things that get to\nthat level of severity of,\nand often a person knows that.\nI mean, am I in a place where I know\nI'm not healthy\nand I'm having kind of scary thoughts,\nthen we need,\nthat's a person who\nreally shouldn't be doing\nthat on their own.\n- Great, thank you for that.\n- Yeah, you're welcome.\n- So we've been talking\na lot about talking.\n- Huhm.\n- And now I'd like to talk a\nlittle bit about chemistry.\n- Yes.\n- Drugs.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- So maybe first we could\ntalk prescription drugs.\nI mean you're a psychiatrist,\nso you're approved to,\nand presumably do prescribe\nmedication where appropriate.\nI mean, this is a vast\nlandscape of course.\nWe've got ADHD and I should just tell you,\nI get more questions about\nADHD and the drugs related\nto ADHD and dopamine than any\nother topic, any other topic.\nSo there's ADHD, there's\nOCD, there's depression,\nthere's antidepressants and so forth.\nIs there some way that we can,\nwrap our arms around all of that\nas a way of waiting into this,\nthis drug question and just address,\nhow does one decide when\nmedication is useful?\nBecause in the end,\nthe dissection tool that the psychiatrist\nor therapist has is language.\nAnd at some point,\none has to make an assessment\nabout dopamine or serotonin\nor whether or not a given drug would help.\nAnd most therapies,\nI believe don't involve putting\nsomeone in a brain scanner.\nAnd to my knowledge,\nthere still is not a very\ngood blood test to assess,\noh, is this person's dopamine low or high,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong.\nAnd ultimately that,\nand I know there are companies out there,\nso I'm not trying to\nundermine those companies.\nBut if I happen to do\nthat in this statement,\nif you take a blood test\nand find that your serotonin\nmetabolites are low,\nmy understanding is it's\npossible that you are too low\nin serotonin in the brain,\nbut that's a very indirect window\ninto what's really going on.\nSo how does,\nhow do you think about\nprescription drugs in the context\nof treating trauma and other\nconditions and then maybe\nwe'll drill into some of the\nmore specific conditions?\n- Sure, I mean,\nI would first comment that\nright there aren't tests\nfor these things.\nAnd I think the tests for metabolites,\nI mean, things are so different.\nBy the time, what we're talking\nabout has been metabolized,\noften to some very significant extent.\nLeft the brain,\nnow it's in the peripheral blood\nthat we really don't\nlearn from that, right?\nI think that we tend to over\nutilize medicines in this\ncountry because we have\na healthcare system\nthat often that's so based\non throughput that we want to\npolish the hood when there's a\nproblem in the engine, right?\nSo we overutilize medicines\noften as an end point, right?\nOh, we're going to make that\nperson's depression better\nwith an antidepressant.\nWell, I mean maybe, right?\nBut most of the time for\nthe person's depression\nto really get better and stay better,\nthey need to unravel what's\ndriving the depression, right'\nSo the first step is I think\nthey're cut two steps to it, right?\nThe first assessment step is,\nis there a diagnosis that,\nthat the vast majority of the time,\nif not sometimes, all the time,\nreally warrants a medicine?\nSo the bipolar disorder, OCD, ADD, right?\nThese are diagnoses that we,\nwe understand more about\nthem and what's going on\nin the brain and how medicines\ncan treat or stabilize them,\nwhich doesn't mean the\nmedicine is necessarily,\nit's not a substitute for therapy, right?\nBut sometimes the medicine and\ntherapy can go hand in hand.\nSo for OCD, for example,\nwarrants therapy, but it almost,\nnot always, but it almost\nalways warrants medicine too,\nso that you can ease the\nsystems that are making\nthe rigidity and the\nrepetition in the brain.\nSo the first kind of branch point can be,\nwhat is the diagnosis?\nWhat is the level of severity, right?\nAnd I think that's very,\nvery important where I\nthink it's a little more,\nmaybe even interesting is using medicines\nto help the person engage in the therapy\nas productively as possible.\nAnd here's where I think we're so limited\nby how we categorize medicines\nand this sort of pharmaceutical\ninsurance driven medical system\nwe have that I think throws\nus off in tremendous ways.\nSo you think about how\nmedicines are categorized,\nso antidepressants.\nAnd the vast majority of people who are\nhelped by antidepressants,\nthey're not, they don't have\nclinically severe depression, right?\nThose medicines create more\ndistress tolerance in us, right?\nAnd if you think about\nhow helpful that can be,\nif you're going to go,\nnow you're going to do\nsomething difficult, right?\nYou're going to bring that\ntrauma or the stressors\nto the surface and you're going to process\nand you're going to try\nand make life change.\nIf we can make more\ndistress tolerance in us,\nthat can be so, so much better, right?\nAnd think about the category\nof medicines that are called\nantipsychotics, which really\nputs people off, right?\nBut most of the prescriptions\nfor antipsychotics\nare not for psychosis, right?\nAnd there are ways in which\nlow dosing of some of those\nmedicines can help intervene\nin negative pathways, right?\nIn pathways that are about distress.\nAnd sending out those tendrils\nof neurons that are about hyper vigilance\nand avoidance, right?\nIn in our brain.\nAnd we can often get at that.\nAnd if you can improve\nsomeone's distress tolerance\nand you can use medicines\nthat take away what clinically\nis rumination, right?\nNot the standard meaning of that word,\nbut the clinical meaning of it,\nwhere there are distress\ncenters in our brain\nthat are overactive.\nAnd then we get stuck in these\nmaladaptive negative pathways\nwhere we think about something\nover and over and over again,\nwith no real chance of solving\nit because that's not what's\ngoing on inside of us.\nSo medicines can help that,\nbut we have to have some flexibility\naround their conception\nand the modern medical system\nof like 15 minute visits,\nto a psychiatrist that are weeks apart.\nI mean, I don't understand\nhow that goes well, right?\nIn the vast majority of times,\nI think it doesn't go well\nbecause it's not enough time\nto do the therapy, even\ngenerate the understanding.\nSo then medicines get\nthrown into the person.\nThis is how,\nwe use, I think approximately\nfive times as much medicine,\nI think across the board as say\nthe Dutch population, right?\nThen you think, well,\nwhy is five times more,\nis a lot more medicine, right?\nAnd you know, they have\na healthcare system\nand a cultural system that to\nthe best of my understanding\nis more rooted in taking\nresponsibility for oneself, right?\nSo if a person comes in and\ncholesterol is high, right?\nThe first order of business is,\nhey, you could take better\ncare of yourself, right?\nLike this person really needs to lose\nsome weight exercise more, right'\nThey're not just jumping to like,\nlet me give you a medicine and you know,\nand shift you through\nthe healthcare system\nand out the other side of the door, right?\nAnd the same thing is\ntrue in mental health,\nand I'm not trying to be critical\nto the psychiatrists or the\nnurse practitioners or people\nwho are practicing in that way,\nbecause oftentimes there\nis no choice, right?\nIf they're working in a\nhealthcare system that,\nthat the standard is highly\nspaced or spaced apart,\n15 minute visits, what\nalternative is there, right.\nBut to look at, okay,\nI'm going to use medicines\nbecause I don't have another\ntool to bring to bear.\nSo I think the healthcare system\nand its focus on throughput\nand it's short term talk about,\nwe talk about short term response, right?\nShort term soothing at the\nexpense of long-term health.\nAnd I think that is the metaphor for,\nthat applies to our\nhealthcare system, right?\nWhere if we,\nif we are going to try and\ntreat a symptom in a short term,\nwe're going to do it in a 15 minute visit,\nthat we're going to do it in a way\nthat maybe it soothes a symptom,\nmaybe it doesn't, but it\ndoes not get at the problem.\nWe need to invest more\nresources to get at the problem\nand I think that's\nwhere a sort of protest,\nif people, as a society, we say,\nlook, we don't like the way\nour healthcare is going.\nLike, we need more focus\non what the actual problems\nare that yes,\nwe would spend more money,\nto treating people and\ntaking care of people\n'cause it's more human time,\nbut ultimately about less\nsuffering, less death, right?\nAnd ultimately more productivity.\nI think as an economy,\nwe would save so much money\nif we spend money on the human\naspects of mental healthcare,\nbecause people would be more functional.\nThey're spending less time\nin the hospital, right?\nThey're more productive\nwhen they're working.\nThere's less entry into the\ncriminal justice system.\nSo I think medicines get overused\nin part for systemic reasons,\nin large part, for systemic reasons.\nAnd also for some of these\ncategorization reasons,\noh, that person meets\nsome technical criteria\nfor depression.\nWe got to give them this medicine\ninstead of really thinking,\nwait, what's going on in this person.\nAnd I see this over and over again.\nI see one who is on seven medicines\nand they're on seven medicines\nto treat seven different symptoms.\nAnd now they have side effects\nfrom all those seven medicines.\nMaybe two of them are to\ntreat the side effects\nfrom the other five, right?\nAnd that's bad, right?\nAnd if you really get at\nwhat's going on in them,\nnow they're doing much better\nand maybe they're on two medicines, right?\nSo I dunno if that's a\nhelpful answer to that.\n- It is, it's a very helpful answer.\nI mean, I think at least in the spheres\nthat I run these days,\nI hear a lot of negative\nstatements about antidepressants.\nI think, I'm old enough to remember\nthe book, \"Listening to Prozac.\"\nI remember when Prozac and its\nand things like it\nfirst started showing up\nand the excitement.\nAnd then nowadays I hear more\nabout the problems with all\nthese drugs and maybe that's just,\n'cause I have arms in\nthe, both the scientific,\nbut also in the kind of wellness community\nwhere people think a lot\nabout behavioral change.\nFortunately I think\nthat's that they do that.\nBut of course these\ndrugs, as you mentioned,\ncan have enormous utility as well.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- I'd like to just pick up on one theme\nthat I haven't heard a\nlot about anywhere else,\nwhich is the short term versus\nthe long term use of these drugs.\n'Cause I could imagine,\nsomeone feeling like they're\nfinally going to tackle something\nthat's been inside them\nfor a long time either\nbecause they're really struggling\nor because they're just done with\nnot working it through\nand they decide to start a medication\nthat would give them higher\nlevels of distress tolerance\nfor a short while.\nI mean, is there anything to say\nthat someone couldn't take a\nproperly prescribed medication\nfor a week or for the first\nthree months of the work?\n- Yes.\n- And then know that they can come off it\nbecause I think that the black\nand white model of, okay,\nyou're either going to start\nthis drug and stay on it forever\nor be taking some drugs forever.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- Or you're not going to take anything.\nI mean, that just seems to,\nlife doesn't have,\ndoes life have to work that way?\n- [Paul] Right.\nIs there a short term use\nthat can be effective?\n- Yeah, absolutely, yes.\nIn American medicine we are\nso much better at starting\nmedicines than we are at\ntaking them away, right?\nAnd part of that I think\nis driven by such a strong\npresence of the pharmaceutical industry\nand the pharmaceutical industry\ndoes a lot of very good things, right?\nBut you know,\nthere's such thing as too\nmuch of a good thing, right?\nAnd then as a society, when\nsomething seems positive,\nthis I think also is human nature.\nWe can overinvest in it, right?\nSo you think about when Prozac\nand those kinds of medicines\ncame out, they were safer medicines,\nthey're billed as antidepressants\nand the thought was,\nwell, they're going to\nfix depression, right?\nAnd it's not how that works, right?\nSo if we look at them as tools, right,\nthen we can deploy them\nsometimes for the longer term\n'cause sometimes that's necessary.\nBut absolutely for the\nshorter term, absolutely.\nIf we thought of Prozac and\nthose kind of medicines,\nnot as, oh they're\nantidepressants, we think, look,\nwhat they do is they,\nthey seem to make there be\nmore serotonin in certain\ncircuits that are important\nfor mood regulation,\nanxiety regulation, distress tolerance.\nSo those medicines can\nreally help somebody\nif they're very severely depressed\nand we want to sort of\nget them feeling better.\nThey can also help someone if\nthey could use more distress\ntolerance in a discrete\nperiod of time, right?\nWhen we think about them that way,\nwe think about them as\ntools that we could apply\nfor short term or long term.\nWe don't see them as fixes, right?\nAnd we don't see them as then substitutes\nfor the human to human work\nthat needs to be done.\nI mean, I've been sort of in my training\nat times in healthcare systems\nand I've seen in many other circumstances\nthat look at medicines as\nanswers and this idea that,\nthat person is a, and a lot of times\nthere'll be a number, right, right?\nAnd the number is the diagnosis\nand that number gets this medicine.\nAnd I'm not sure we could\nbe more misguided than that\nand that's what leads to adding\nmedicines, adding medicines,\nit's not working.\nOf course it's not working,\nbecause no one's really paying\nattention to what's going on.\nSo add more medicines and then\nmedicines for the medicines.\nAnd I mean, we know this is true.\nWe know this is true,\nbut we haven't had the\nwherewithal as a society\nto say like with a lot\nof things in society,\nto say like this isn't okay, right?\nI mean, we need more.\nLike give these people\nwho are trying to help us.\nThey need more latitude to help us.\nWe need more human to human contact\nto get at what's really going on, and yes,\nthat's an investment of\ntime and energy and money\nin the short term and\nsometimes that's money\nfrom the systems, right?\nBut if we do that, my\ngoodness, look at the,\nlook at the payoff of that.\n- What is your thought about anxiety\nand ADHD as a separate phenomena,\nin terms of medication.\nAgain, ADHD is the thing\nthat seems to come up most in questions.\nI can't tell you the number\nof especially students,\nbut also young working professionals\nand even people who are\noutside those categories\nwho are interested or taking\nRitalin, Adderall, Modafinil\nor Armodafinil or Vyvanse,\nbecause they seem to\nstruggle focusing without it.\nOr, and I don't know,\n'cause I'm not one of those individuals,\nor because they seem to just\nlike how well they can focus\nwhen they do take those compounds.\nAnd so my understanding is\nthese compounds mainly increase\ndopaminergic transmission in the brain,\nalso adrenaline, epinephrine in the brain.\nSo they're more or less stimulants.\nThey look a lot like, at least chemically,\nthey look a lot like\ncocaine and amphetamine,\nalthough they're not quite\ncocaine and amphetamine.\nSo should we be concerned about this?\nIs this a different sort of epidemic?\nCan these drugs be used to train the brain\nto focus and then people can\nwithdraw from these drugs?\nI mean, I think this is a huge topic\nand one that maybe warrants\nits own episode entirely,\nbut as long as we're on the topic,\nwhat are your thoughts\nabout medication for ADHD?\n- Sure, I think medication for ADHD\ncan be extremely effective\nand the studies show us that, right?\nThey show us that if there is ADD,\nthen medication for ADD,\nis very, very helpful and\nthat's true in youths,\nit seems to be true if adults\nhave adult ADHD or ADD,\nwe kind of know that's true,\nbut all attention deficit\nis not Attention Deficit Disorder, right?\nAnd there we go to the\nreflexive 15 minute visits,\nthrow medicines at things, right?\nAttention deficit can come\nfrom many, many places.\nAnd one of them is anxiety, right?\nThere's so many other reasons\ndepression affects attention,\npoor sleep affects attention,\npoor diet can affect attention,\nstress in life can affect attention.\nSo, and, and certainly trauma.\nAnd the thing,\nthe problems that trauma spins\noff can affect attention.\nSo this is really the,\nthis is really the truth that\nwhile teaching once about\nmedicines and pharmacology,\nI was frustrated about how\nthe answer to everything\nwas like, what medicine do we use?\nWhat medicine do we\nuse, as opposed to like,\nthis is just one piece of the puzzle.\nAnd I told an anecdote, which,\nI think it was a clinical anecdote,\nlike what do you think is going on?\nAnd I think that if I\ntold that to, I dunno,\nmiddle school students or something,\nthey would probably say,\nyou just told a story of a\nperson with a rock in their shoe,\nwhich is what I, the story\nthat I was actually telling, right?\nBut several people I was talking to,\nthey're physicians, right?\nADD, right?\nIt's like, no,\nevery time the person\nsteps down the rock hurts\nand they're not able to\nmaintain attention, right?\nLike that's what's going on.\nBut we're so programmed\nto think about medicines\nand inappropriate use of\nADD medicines, as you said,\nthere's dopaminergic impact.\nThere's epinephrine,\nnorepinephrine impact.\nWe're affecting what are called\nprefrontal alpha 2 receptors\nthat like really need to be\nhelped if there's real ADD\nbut if there isn't, that\nis not a good thing to do,\nwhich is why it is quite fascinating\nthat when people have ADD,\nthey tolerate generally\nstimulants very well,\nwithout the other problems\nthat can come of stimulants.\nAnd again, I don't know, I\ndon't claim to know why that is,\nbut we see that phenomenon.\nBut when people are being treated for ADD\nand they don't have ADD,\nwhich sometimes they\nknow they don't have ADD,\nbut the stimulants make\nthem function better.\nSo they go to somebody\nand get the stimulants.\nThat's not a good thing to do, right?\n'Cause stimulants, when\nthey're not needed over time,\nthey do affect our physical function.\nThey affect our judgment, right?\nThere are a lot of negative\nthings that come from that.\nThey can affect the\nvigilance inside of us.\nSo, yes, it's a valid diagnosis,\nbut it gets made when it's\nnot present very often,\nwhich we see with a lot of diagnoses\nthat you can throw medicine at.\nWe see the same thing\nwith bipolar disorder.\nTrue bipolar disorder\nis extremely important\nto utilize medicines effectively,\nbut how many people are\ndiagnosed with bipolar disorder\nwho have, they absolutely\ndon't have bipolar disorder,\nbut it can be a catchall diagnosis\nbecause there is in a sense,\n\"something to do for it,\" right?\nAnd you can throw medicine at it, right?\nSo I mean, what do we expect, right?\nIf we have a healthcare\nsystem where you get 15 minute\nvisits with your psychiatrist,\nof course we're going to\nthrow medicines at everything.\nAnd then the training paradigms\nare going to look at it through that lens.\nAnd then very often again,\nI give the example of seeing\nsomebody on seven medicines.\nI mean the first thought I\nhave is how many of those\nmedicines are actually counterproductive?\nAnd a lot of the time it's not like, oh,\nevery now and then one\nis counterproductive.\nNo, that's the case.\nThat's the case a lot of the time.\nAnd again, I come back to,\nif we're not putting thought into it,\nwhat other result would we expect?\n- Thank you for that answer.\nI'm very curious what\nconstitutes negative effects\nof stimulants.\nSo if somebody's taking\nAdderall or Ritalin in order\nto work longer hours or focus\nbecause they have attention deficit,\nbut not necessarily ADHD.\nAnd again, I'm not\nrecommending anyone do this.\nI've just heard the numbers\nthat have come back at least\nfrom surveys and discussions\nwith colleagues at Stanford and elsewhere,\nother college campuses that\nupwards of 75% of college\nstudents use semi\nregularly, these drugs off,\nnot by prescription, just\nto study and to learn.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- I can imagine sleep\nissues because people,\nbecause these are stimulants,\nwhat sorts of other issues\ncan they create for people\nproblems that they can create?\n- Sure, I mean,\nI think a touchstone maybe\nthat's running through\nour conversation, right,\nis prioritizing the short term benefit\nover solving a long-term problem, right?\nWhich we might say is a human tendency\nand we see it across the\ntopics that we're discussing.\nSo, short-term use of stimulants.\nSure, people are more alert.\nThey can stay awake more,\nthey can study more intensely and longer.\nOkay, there's some\nshort-term benefit of that,\nover there, even there,\nthere can be problems, right?\nBut we can say,\nlet's just say for sake of\nargument that in the short term,\nthere's something to be\ngained by doing that, right?\nBut oh my goodness,\nthere's so much that is,\nthere's so much risk to that, right?\nAnd how many times have I seen someone\nwho they're doing that\nand they're just doing\nthat to study, right?\nAnd now they're addicted\nto the amphetamines\nand their behavior changes\nand they don't know it.\nTalk about shifting our brain\ntowards a more defensive,\nsort of suspicious, outward look,\nview of the world that\nwe see a lot of that.\nSo we see judgment impairment,\nwe see heightened levels of anxiety.\nWe see more impulsivity\nin decision-making.\nAnd sometimes we,\nit can get to the point\nof seeing Frank psychosis.\nNow, that's not common,\nbut have I seen young people\nwho've done exactly what\nyou're describing, right?\nThey're using Adderall or\nthey're using Ritalin to study.\nAnd then I see them when they're\ncoming into the hospital,\nthey're screaming about how\nsomeone's trying to hurt them.\nBoy, it's the worst case scenario,\nbut it shows like that's\nwhere that can go.\nAnd how much is there between the,\noh, I'm just using it to\nstudy and that severe,\noutcome that is actually\nquite negative for a person\nand it might change how they think\nabout that friendship or\nthat relationship, right?\nA lot negative happens\nwhen we change our brains\nwithout an ability to see like,\nwhat is it actually doing to us?\nSo, which is part of my whole\ntheme about trauma, right?\nIt changes our brains and\nwe don't know it, right?\nWell the same can be,\nthe same is often true of\namphetamines used inappropriately.\nIt shifts our brain.\nAnd we don't realize that we're\na little bit more impulsive\nin our decision making, a\nlittle bit less trusting.\nThese are significant negative things\nthat if we don't know it,\nthe person will just say, yeah,\noh, I'm just using it to study.\nI'm using it to work more.\nThat's not, you know,\nthat's not without it's\nhigh level of risk.\n- What are your thoughts on cannabis?\nI've said it many times on this podcast\nbefore and I'll say again,\nI feel fortunate that I've\nnever really been attracted\nto alcohol or drugs of any kind ,\nso much so that if all the\nalcohol and all the marijuana\nand all the cocaine\namphetamine disappeared,\nI wouldn't notice any\nchange in my life, right?\nAnd I feel lucky in that way,\n'cause I know a lot of people feel\nan attraction to these things\nthat it is almost a gravitational force.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- From their first drink, they just feel,\nI once heard it described in this,\nI think it was an Augusten\nBurroughs book, \"Dry\"\nwhere he was an alcoholic.\nHe said that the first drink he had,\nit felt like this magic elixir\nthat meshed with the\nphysiology of his blood\nin the most seamless way\nand as I was reading this, I thought,\noh my goodness, first of all,\nthat's the most foreign experience\nfor me in terms of alcohol.\nAnd second gosh, that must be terrible.\nAnd you can,\nbut at the same time you\ncould really understand\nwhy someone would be drawn to that.\n- Yes.\nSo cannabis nowadays is legal\nor decriminalized in\nmany areas of the U.S.\nA lot of people seem to use the argument,\nit's better than drinking\nor they only do it for\nsleep or anxiety management.\nI'm not looking to demonize\nor support the cannabis.\nSo what are your thoughts about cannabis\nfor anxiety management, depression?\nAnd maybe even for ADHD for that matter.\nSure.\n- If I could make an\nalcohol comment, right?\nThe number of times I've seen alcohol\nlike having been a good idea for coping\nwith something approaches zero, right?\nLike the alcohol for\ncoping is just never good.\nAnd there's an additional risk\nfactor that there's certain\ngenetic profiles where people\nrespond strongly to alcohol.\nLike, as you're saying, it's not just,\noh, there's a little bit of\nshort term relief of distress,\nbut there's this sort of euphoric response\nand those genetics,\nwe don't understand them completely.\nThey seem to be in Northern\nEuropean populations,\nmore prevalent as you head\nwest in Northern Europe.\nSo we understand where risk\nfactors are demographically,\nbut we can't pinpoint\nthat for any one person.\nAnd there's a tremendous risk of that,\nwhen a person responds so\nstrongly to alcohol or habituates\ncoping to alcohol.\nCannabis is a little bit\nof a different story.\nI mean, how I have seen that play out,\nand again, this isn't\ncoming from any expertise\naround the neuro the\nneuropharmacology of it,\nlike how is this really\nworking in the brain?\nBut it comes from an observation\nthat what it seems to do is\nto narrow our attentional\nperspective, right?\nSo it's why people will\nsay, well, they want to,\nthey want to use cannabis\nbefore like watching a movie with friends\nor something, right?\nAnd, and I think, okay,\nI think why people are doing that\nis because our cognitive spectrum narrows.\nAnd then instead of worrying\nabout that thing at work\nor that relationship issue,\none can just be present, right?\nIt gates out other\nattentional intrusions, right?\nSo in some ways, I mean,\nI've absolutely seen it\nbe helpful to people.\nI mean, it's been legalized\nin Oregon, which is where my,\nI spent a lot of my time\nand it's not where all of my practice is,\nbut what I have seen is\nit is at times helpful,\nsafe around sleep, right?\nBecause a person can gate\nout other intrusive thoughts\nand they can just relax and go to sleep.\nBut there can be another side of that too,\nthat at higher levels of distress,\nat higher levels of tension,\nwhat it can do is narrow the focus\nof cognition to the thing\nthat is negative, right?\nSo the idea that, oh, like,\noh, this is a treatment for,\ndepression, anxiety,\ntrauma, is not true, right?\nCan it be helpful under\ncertain circumstances?\nLike I think the answer to that is, yeah.\nI mean, I know the answer to that is yes.\n'Cause I've seen it play\nout clinically that way,\nbut think it can also be harmful too.\nSo there, again, like\nanything that has any power,\npower to influence our brains,\nwe want to be thoughtful\nand careful about it.\nI mean, do I think that\nit's safer than alcohol?\nYes, I mean, I mean, like we,\nwe so clearly see that.\nDoes that mean?\nOr it's just uniformly safe?\nNo, right.\nSo we want to be respectful of anything\nthat can change how our brain is working\nand I think that includes,\ncertainly includes alcohol.\nAnd I think it certainly\nincludes cannabis too.\n- I'd love to talk about\npsychedelics for two reasons.\nOne, there seems to be a\ntremendous amount of interest\nin psychedelics as a\ntherapeutic clinical tool.\nI know there's also recreational\nuse and I'll just preface\nall this by saying that\nmy stance is we absolutely\nknow for sure that these\nare controlled substances,\nthey're illegal to possess,\nsell or use in most of the country.\nThere are few areas where\nit, they are decriminalized.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nAnd psychedelics is a\nbroad category, of course.\nAnd we can touch on some of\nthe different, different ones,\nbut whereas five years or so,\nfive years ago or so I\nwas truly afraid to say\nthe word psychedelics in\nany kind of public venue,\nthere are laboratories at\nStanford working on ketamine,\npsilocybin, MDMA, mostly in animal models.\nThere's terrific work going on\nat Johns Hopkins University\nSchool of Medicine,\nMatthew Johnson's Lab,\nand others looking at the\nclinical applications,\nmainly of high dose psilocybin and LSD.\nThere's the maps trials with MDMA.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- So nowadays it's safe\nfor an academic like me\nto say the word psychedelics.\nAnd I'm, I'd love to\napproach this question\nof psychedelics from a place\nof true exploration and curiosity.\nBut with the preface that\nwe're talking about this\nin a legal clinical setting.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And the legality is something\nthat's now in process.\nI don't think it's completed,\nbut that's my understanding,\nbut there are trials.\nYou can go to clinical\ntrials.gov and put in MDMA,\nand you'll see a bunch of clinical trials\nthat are happening in\nthe recruiting subjects.\nSo I think it's safe to\nhave the conversation now,\nand I'd love your thoughts\nabout psychedelics.\nMaybe we could start\nwith psilocybin and LSD\nas a broad category of drugs,\nthat at least my\nunderstanding is they touch on\nmainly the serotonin system,\nsome specific receptor\nactivation and modulation,\ntend to change notions of space and time,\nadjust internal state.\nMaybe we would start there.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And then maybe venture\ninto some of the other ones.\nSo what are your thoughts on\nthese drugs for therapeutic\npotential also potential\nhazards, etcetera.\n- Yeah, I think if we look\nat the true psychedelics,\nso psilocybin and LSD, right?\nBecause ketamine and MDMA,\nthey're different categories of medicine.\nThey're these sort of novel\ntools to bring to bear.\nBut if we start with psilocybin,\nLSD, true psychedelics,\nI think why it is,\nwhy they have gained so much momentum over\nthe last several years is\nbecause the data coming\nfrom the labs and the academic centers\nis so powerfully positive.\nAnd as someone who's,\nI'm interested in anything\nthat's potentially helpful, right?\nAnd I want to learn and understand that\nbecause a lot of things that\nare potentially helpful,\nyou know, you go and look at the data\nand you see that that's not\nhelpful, that's harmful.\nI think what we have\nseen with psychedelics\nis that they're so helpful, right?\nAnd the trials are bearing that out.\nAnd of course these are\nused in professional hands\nand with the right kind of guidance\nare extremely powerful tools,\nbut used in the right way\nby someone who knows how to utilize them\nin the right setting can have\nan immense positive impact.\nAnd that's why I think\nthat the thought is there\nacross people and more and more\npeople feel comfortable saying\nit and talking about it,\nI mean we're in the state of Oregon now\nwhere the thought is,\nwe're moving towards\nlegalization of psilocybin\nearly in 2023.\nAnd it's part the new data, right?\nAnd how it meshes with\nthe older data, right?\nHow it meshes with data\nfrom the 60s and 70s\nthat showed such a strong, powerful impact\nof these medicines.\nAnd I have a whole set of\nthoughts about what's happening\nthere and they're just\ntheir conjectures, right?\nBut my read of, you know,\nas best I can try and\nunderstand the neuroscience\nand the clinical applicability\nand the changes is,\nwhat happens is we see less communication\nor less chatter in the outer\nparts of the brain, right?\nthe the outer parts of the cortex.\nAnd I think that as human beings,\nwe sort of glorify the parts\nof the brain that only we have.\nI mean, certainly in my growing up, right?\nI mean, what did I learn?\nEven if you think about like,\nlearning about the brain\nin high school, right?\nI learned that like, wow,\nwe're great as humans\n'cause we have language\nand other animals don't\nand we can use tools and\nlike aren't we so great\nbecause we have this part of\nthe brain that other animals\ndon't and it lets us function, right?\nOkay, there's some truth to that.\nThat we can do things others can't do.\nBut we get lost often in the\nouter parts of the cortex,\nwhich I think are about survival, right?\nSo we come back to the things you\nand I talked about early on of like,\nwhy are these trauma\nmechanisms in us, right?\nSo like so much of what's going on\nin our brains is about survival.\nAnd I think living so to\nspeak in the cortex, right?\nAnd the outer part of the brain\nis consistent with a focus on survival.\nSo if you think that's where language is,\nthat's where vision is,\nthat's where executive function is.\nSo planning and task execution,\nso much of that is about making our way\nin the world around us.\nSo we tend to glorify\nthat and think, well,\nthat's in a sense where\nour existence is, right?\nAnd I believe that is not true, right?\nAnd again, can I say that for\nsure, of course not, right?\nBut my read of 20 years\nof doing clinical work\nand thinking about all sorts of medicines\nand thinking about the psychedelics\nin a lot of depth,\nI think that what they do is they take us\nout of the cortex, right?\nBecause that's where we\nrun into these problems.\nThat's where we bounce\nthings over and over again\nthat the distress centers deepen our brain\nand the brain stem kind of\nalign with the outer parts\nof the cortex and they say, right,\nwe we're in distress.\nWe want to stay alive.\nOften a lot of us have had\ntrauma that makes these changes\nin the brain and then we're\nthinking all the time,\nlike what would I do\nif, if there were war,\nwhat would I do if there's\ncivil war, if someone bombs us,\nwhat will I do if the\neconomy collapses, right?\nWhat will I do if somebody gets sick?\nWe're thinking all this future projection\nthat is all coming from\na place of fear, right?\nIt's all coming from a\ndesire to think about things\nand control the future\nwith this part of the brain\nthat is so uniquely human, right?\nAnd I think when we take\nthe neuro transmission\nout of those places, right?\nAnd we set it in a part of the brain\nand say the insular cortex, right?\nThe parts of the brain\nthat are sort of in the middle, right?\nWhich I think, I believe is\nwhere our humanness really is.\nSo the psychedelics make there\nbe less chatter communication\nin these other parts of the brain.\nAnd then we become seated\nin the part of the brain\nthat I believe is most\nabout our experience\nof true humanness,\nwhich is why, when you read about,\npeople who have experiences\nand I've heard about them\nand people talk to me about this, right?\nThey've utilized it.\nThey talk with me.\nSo whether it's someone\ntelling me their story\nor it's coming from research data,\nit's why people can sort\nof see with clarity that,\noh, that trauma, that thing\nis not my fault, right?\nLike we feel a sense of\ncompassion for ourselves.\nWe relieve ourselves,\nrelease ourselves from guilt\nand you say, why is this\nso helpful to people?\nAnd I think it's because it can do\nwhat we are trying to\nget at in good therapy,\nbut it can really catalyze\nthat by just putting a person\nin that part of the brain that can see it\nfor what it is,\nwithout all that chatter\nin the cortex about,\nhey, got to think it's your\nfather, you won't avoid it again\nand that makes the repetition compulsion.\nHow do I think ahead to the\nnext thing that might happen\nand what else bad might happen?\nI mean, we don't get anywhere doing that.\nAnd I think where we get somewhere\nis when we seed ourselves\ndeeper in the brain,\nwhich I think we do if,\nif we're like doing really\ngood therapy and we're,\nwe're in the deep parts\nof the brain, but these,\nthese psychedelics,\nthe medicinal value I believe\nis putting us in that part\nof the brain where a person\ncan really find truth.\nAnd that's why I think that,\nthat's come so far in these few years\nbecause I think that is\nvery clinically evident.\nAnd I think we're going to\nsee more and more of the value\nof that and how, what the\npsychedelics do can become,\nI believe a heuristic for\nunderstanding like wait,\nhow are our brains really functioning?\nAnd what are the parts that really matter\nto our experience of being human?\nIt's those parts of the brain, right?\nThe deep parts of the\nbrain, the insular cortex\nand the areas around it that\nsay light up when a person\nhas an experience of spiritual ecstasy\nor an experience of connection\nwith another person, right?\nWe kind of have these telltale\nmarkers that something\nis going on there that's very\nimportant and very special.\nAnd I think we're more\nattracted to the outer parts\nof the brain in part 'cause\nthey're easier to study, right?\nI mean, as you know, better than I do,\nwe started studying the brain\nthrough lesion studies, right?\n'Cause it was easy to,\nor to see if a person got\nhurt in this part of the brain\nor had a stroke in that part\nof the brain, what changes?\nSo we look at the cortex 'cause one,\nit's easier to study and\nwe tend to glorify it.\nAnd I think that has been misguided.\nAnd I think that we're learning.\nabout how that's been misguided\nthrough the study of these\nnovel modalities from\nWestern perspectives,\nwould of course they've\nbeen used for a long,\nlong time in other cultures,\nbut novel from our perspective.\n- Yeah, I'm fascinated by this idea\nthat in these middle brain structures is,\nis where our humanity lies\nand as you said,\nI also wonder whether or not\nother animals experience life\nmore from that orientation\nwith less chatter.\nWe can only guess, but.\n- [Paul] right.\nYou know, that a dog lover\nand being in the presence of\nanimals that seem to just be\npresent in what's happening in\ntheir immediate environment,\nnot too much anticipation.\n- Right, I mean, through sentient right?\nI mean what you're talking about\nis sentience, it's important.\nAnd sentience is extremely\nimportant, right?\nAnd if we're going to\novervalue say language,\nthen I think we undervalue\nsentience, right?\nWhich is why I think we tend\nto undervalue animals, right?\nAnd their suffering, we say,\nwell, they're not saying\nanything about it, right?\nAnd you know, they're not\nwriting about it, so, okay.\nIt's easy to ignore and we think about,\nagain the hubris of that right though,\nbecause we can think and talk and write,\nlike we must be feeling more\nthan species that don't do that.\nI mean I think,\nI think that that is so true\nand that we're going to\nunderstand more about sentience\nin other species and how,\nthat's at the core of existence.\nAnd my hope would be that we value\nmore humans and animals, right?\nThrough the evolution\nof that understanding.\n- The hallucinations that\naccompany psychedelics\nlike LSD and psilocybin have\nsuch an attractive force\nto them as a concept and as an experience.\nAnd so I think most often when\npeople hear hallucinogens,\nthey think, and psychedelics,\nthey think about hallucinating.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- It makes sense why they would.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- But what's so interesting to\nme is nothing in your answer\nabout psychedelics,\npsilocybin and LSD focused\non hallucinations, per se.\nIt was more about feeling states,\naccessing a feeling state or a relation\nto an event or to a person or to oneself.\nMaybe even I,\nI caught hints of maybe\neven empathy for one's self.\n- Yes.\n- [Andrew] For the first time.\n- Yes.\n- None of that had to\ndo with seeing sounds\nor hearing colors and these kind of cliche\nstatements about hallucination.\nSo I am aware of laboratories,\none at a University of\nCalifornia Davis in particular,\nbut a few others that are trying\nto generate chemical variance\nof psychedelics that lack the\nhallucinogenic properties,\nbut maintain these other\nproperties as therapeutic tools.\nAnd as I say that, I realize that I,\npeople in the psychedelic\ncommunity are probably thinking,\noh, that's horrible.\nThat's the dismantling of the core thing.\nBut the simple question is,\ndo you think the hallucinations\nare valuable for anything?\n- And I think we're really\ngetting into the philosophical,\nright, the ontological, right?\nThere's this sort of trying\nto understand being, right?\nAnd I don't claim to\nknow the answer to that.\nI think that at times it\nseems like the hallucinations\nhave a metaphorical or a symbolic way\nof being helpful, right?\nBecause people will come\nto understand things\nthat they hold dear and true\nafter the experience, right?\nThat often, not always,\ncome through the lens\nof the hallucinations.\nSo are the hallucinations necessary?\nAre those hallucinations\nsometimes important sometimes not?\nI mean, I think we don't understand that.\nAnd I think we want to be respectful\nof the sort of mystery of that.\nBut what I think is fascinating\nis when you think about\nlike substance abuse and\nwhat that means is, well,\none aspect of that is that\na person has experiences,\nthoughts, conceptions of self in the world\nwith the substance that\nwithout the substance,\nthey know are wrong, right?\nPeople talk about, you\nknow, liquid courage, right?\nAnd okay, I feel better about myself\nand I feel courageous 'cause\nI've had a couple of drinks.\nNow, when I, when I, after that,\nI feel like normal about myself\nand that was false, right?\nAnd we see that like,\nthat's part of what substance\nintoxication means, right?\nBut what we see with the\npsychedelic medicines\nis something that's\nincredibly different, right?\nThat people are having\nexperiences that are so delinked\nfrom our normal experience of reality.\nAnd then when they come in a\nsense back online with right,\nin a normal cognitive way,\nthey realize like, wow,\nnow I'm applying all those mechanisms\nof trying to understand truth and to that,\nand what I see is that it's\ntrue and wow, it's true.\nLike, I mean, we hear that\nall the time, which tells me,\nhey, something different\nis going on there.\nAnd of course these are powerful tools\nso misused like very\nbad things can happen.\nBut you think about the clinical\nutility and what does it\nmean that so many people\nchange for the healthier\nor even change their\nlives after an experience\nbecause it so resonates as like,\noh, now I understand\nsomething that's true.\nAnd it's not something bizarre.\nIt's like,\nI wasn't responsible for\nbeing raped that time\nor I'm not less than even\nthough my sexuality or my gender\nidentity's different from some\nsilly binary concept, right?\nLike people kind of often\nget it and they feel\ndifferently about themselves\nand guilt and shame are impacted.\nSo I think we're likely to\nsee that they are powerful\nanti-trauma mechanisms again,\nused clinically in the right hands.\nAnd I think that we're also going\nto see that they're heuristic\nfor understanding our brain\nthat goes against what I see\nas some of the reflexive hubris of,\nwell, the outer parts must be the best\nbecause that's what makes\nus human and other animals don't have it.\nAnd we're better because we're human.\nI mean, it makes no sense, you know?\n- I'd like to talk about MDMA\nand I'll preface this by saying\nI was a participant actually,\ntechnically I'm still a\nparticipant in a clinical trial.\nSo I have experience of doing it twice\nat the trial involves three\nseparate dosings of this.\nI was reluctant to do it\noutside of a clinical trial,\nmostly because I was aware\nthere can be some cardiac effects.\nAnd I liked the idea there\nwould be a clinician on hand.\nAnd I'll just say that\nI found the experiences\nto be profound, beneficial\nand very different\nfrom one session to the next.\nThe first one felt\na whole collection\nof ideas and relational\nthings came up that felt very\npowerful and transformative.\nAnd I do think that I learned there,\nI exported a number of things,\nmy particular experience\nisn't relevant here,\nbut the second time I expected\nit to be the same way.\nAnd it was very mellow and relaxing\nand was deeply tied to kind\nof notions of acceptance.\nSo there weren't all these\nrevelations and wow new insights.\nIt was very much about sort of grounding\ninto a kind of a calmer state.\nSo I have the personal experience\nof benefiting from these in\nways that I think still benefit\nme and was very struck\nby the power of MDMA.\nAnd my very crude understanding\nof the pharmacology\nand the state that is being under MDMA\nis that it encourages or increases\ndopaminergic transmission,\nbut also serotonergic transmission.\n- Yeah.\n- Which is to my knowledge,\na kind of a rare state\nfor the brain to be in\nthat typically it's more\nof a seesaw dopaminergic\ndrive towards external goals\nor more serotonergic drive towards\nmore plasticity or comfort\nwith what one already has.\nAnd so with both those systems amplified,\nthe only way I can describe\nit subjectively is that it,\neverything sort of funneled back in,\nand it was almost like a\npursuit of inner landscape.\nAnd I can only imagine what it\nwould be like in the context\nof doing this with somebody\nelse also taking MDMA.\nI have no idea what that's like.\nThat's my report of the experience.\nI know that the experience can vary.\nWhat are your thoughts about the chemistry\nand what sorts of states\ndo you think MDMA is creating\nthat can explain why it's\na useful therapeutic tool\nin some cases and what sorts\nof cases those might be.\n- Sure, sure.\nTo clarify, I think part\nof what we're starting\nwith is this is very different\nthan the psychedelics, right?\nWhich are seeding our\nconsciousness in these deep centers\nof the brain, right?\nWhereas what MDMA is\ndoing is sort of flooding\nwith positive neurotransmitters, right?\nIn certain parts of the brain.\nAnd I think what that creates\nis a greater permissiveness\ninside to entertain or approach\ndifferent things, right?\nSo I think where we see it's tremend,\nmy read of the data is around potentially\nand we're seeing in some\nof the trials, right?\nTremendous benefit for trauma, right?\nAnd you think about what we\nwere talking about earlier,\nhow this reflexive, guilt, shame,\nhypervigilance, avoidance, right?\nAnd when these systems\nare flooded with these neurotransmitters,\nit's more permissive to sort\nof think about that, right?\nAnd to think about that without again,\nall the chatter of that's your fault,\nor you're never going to get\nanywhere because of that,\nor you know what that means, right?\nThey could kind of go away\nand then we can think about it\nin a way that isn't through\nthe lens of fear, right?\nAnd I think that's,\nthe power there is that\nit's permissive of approaching something,\ncontemplating something,\na different, a novelty as we\ntalk about a de novo approach.\nAnd I think that's also why the experience\ncan vary because you could also see how,\nif you're not thinking\nabout something, right?\nSo there's not a clinical guidance to it,\nyou could be in a state where like,\nhey, I just feel good, right?\nAnd I'm thinking about good things.\nAnd like, that can feel good, right?\nBut it, but that's not necessarily\nproblem solving, right?\nSo the clinical guidance says,\nhey, let's take that state and\ndo something with it, right?\nLet's Now that you're in this state,\nlet's make hay while the\nsun is shinning, right?\nYou're in a state where we can look\nat things that are traumatic, right?\nWe can approach them from\na de novo perspective.\nAnd I think it's part,\nI think that explains why\nyou had these different\nexperiences from one to the other,\nbecause your brain is just in a state\nthat's conducive to something, right?\nBut if there's not\nthe mechanism to have that thing happen,\nlike conducive to something therapeutic,\nthen you might go there on your own.\nOr you might just be in a state\nwhere you have a sense of wellbeing\nand you sit with that.\n- Which sort of seems like a waste to me.\nI mean, this is what I tell\npeople when they ask about MDMA.\nI said, at least from my experience\nthat the potential hazard\nthere is that in that very high\ndopaminergic, serotonergic state,\nthere were moments where I\nfelt like I could get excited\nabout any one specific concept\nthat I might even just think\nabout, for instance,\nwater and how nourishing it is,\nand really just go down the path of water\nand the world and all\nthe water and you can,\nyou're in a state that is\nvery prone to suggestion.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Internal suggestion.\nAnd so the guidance turned out,\nthe guidance from the clinician\nturned out to be immensely\nvaluable in allowing me\nto go into my own heads\nfor bits of time, but\nthen also to resurface\nand share and exchange in a way to,\nI'm trying really get something out of it\nthat was useful and that I could export\nbecause of course water is wonderful,\nbut I'm not really interested in growing\nmy relationship to water.\n- [Paul] Yes.\nAnd I really felt like in,\nI could understand for the,\nI never went to raves\nor anything growing up.\nI never did MDMA recreationally,\nbut I understood for the first time\nhow people could get really\nattached to an environment\nand feel connected to things.\nBecause I think with all that serotonin,\nyou just feel connected\nto everything around you.\nSo I think it's a slippery slope there.\n- Yes.\n- And I don't know what the future\nof the clinical use of MDMA looks like,\nbut I would hope that whoever's thinking\nabout I'm guiding these sessions\nis really thinking carefully,\nalso about evolving the practice\nto help people really move through\nin a sequential way\nso they can leave with something valuable.\n- Yes, 100%, 100%.\nThese are such powerful tools.\nAnd again, if they're powerful tools\nand we're using them without\nrespect for them, right?\nWithout clinical guidance,\nwe incur risk, right?\nI mean, you know,\ngetting obsessed with water\nwhile it probably isn't going to\nhurt you, right?\nBut if someone is out using it,\nthey're around other people,\nwhat one can feel positively about\nor become sort of obsessed\nin the short term about\ncan be very counterproductive, right?\nIt can be a lot of risk to that.\nSo I think it anchors back to\nthese are very powerful tools.\nWe're coming to understand\nthem much, much more.\nAnd we're coming to understand\nthat they have immense\npotential to be helpful to us.\nBut I think and hope that\nthat only also increases\nour respect for those\nmodalities and what can come,\nwhat negative can happen\nif we're not respectful.\n- It's going to be very interesting\nto see where all of this goes\nin the next few years, not\njust in Oregon, but elsewhere.\nOne way or another it's happening.\nIt seems to have a momentum\nthat is not going to stop.\nSo very exciting area to be sure.\n- I agree.\n- I have a question about language.\nIn your book,\nyou talk about how we need to be careful\nabout the use of language around trauma.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- Maybe problem solving and\nproblem describing in general.\nAt one extreme,\nyou hear that your\nbrain and your body hear\nevery word you say, and, you know,\nwe have to be so careful with language.\nAnd that actually frightened\nme for a number of years,\n'cause I would hear that\nand I thought, gosh,\nif I just think that something is bad\nnow it's going to hurt me worse,\nwhich itself is part of that whole,\npacking down of an issue.\nVery hard to avoid thoughts\nwithout distraction.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- So that's one extreme,\non the other hand,\nI can say, I can tell somebody,\nI love them with a tone of hatred.\nI can tell somebody I hate\nthem with a tone of love.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- So how should we think about\nlanguage in parsing trauma?\nAnd in your book you talk about,\nyou give some cautionary notes\nabout talking about depression, trauma\nand PTSD in terms that that might diminish\ntheir real severity in some cases.\nAnd I was really struck by that.\nSo maybe just touch on\nhow should we talk about these\nthings in a way that doesn't\ndiminish them for ourselves\nor for other people.\nAnd at the same time honors the fact\nthat there's a lot of trauma out there.\n- [Paul] Right\n- And there's a lot of\ndepression out there\nand we need to talk about it.\n- Yeah.\nI think this a very complicated\nand in many ways convoluted topic,\nlike I think it's wonderful\nthat we have language,\nbut boy, language leads\nus astray often too.\nYou think about how we,\nhow people define words?\nSomeone says a word, what is it?\nDoes that person know\nwhat that word means?\nWhat nuance are they taking from? it\nWe just have to be very\ncareful what we're saying\nand what we're communicating.\nAnd I think this doesn't mean because,\nthere's a sort of phenomenon now\nwhere people are trying\nto control language\nI think too much,\nlike you can't say anything\nthat someone else might find\nhurtful or you have to refer to people\nin ways they choose to be referred to,\neven if those are ways that\nothers don't understand,\nor ways they themselves have\ndecided or ways that might be\npsychologically or clinically unhelpful.\nSo I think the over control\nof language is not good,\nbut I think the specificity of language\nof what are we trying to\nsay, how are we defining it?\nOr even the word trauma, right?\nWe're talking about trauma.\nSo we want to define\nwhat that means, right?\nIt doesn't just mean like,\noh, anything kind of negative, right?\nBecause then that dilutes it\ndown to meaning nothing, right?\nIt also doesn't just mean,\ninjury and combat, right?\nLike we have to talk about what that is.\nSo I think anchoring it\nto something that rises\nto the magnitude of\noverwhelming our coping skills\nand changing us,\nlike then at least I define\nit that way and I can\ncommunicate that to you\nand we can understand\nwhat we're talking about, right?\nI think that another aspect\nof language, while again,\nwe need this middle ground and\nI don't think that it is okay\nfor the over control of language\nto shut down expression,\nbut we also have to acknowledge,\nhow we're so much less\ndistanced from each other\nthrough social media.\nAnd I think social media can do very,\nvery good things as hopefully\nwe're doing now, right?\nBut it can also be used to harm people\nfrom a distance, right?\nAnd how much hatefulness\nis there out there\nthat I think comes from anger\nand frustration in people,\nback to trauma, right?\nWhere people just want to be angry\nand it's not really issues\nthat they're talking about,\nbut then there's a target of that anger\nand people feel beleaguered by that.\nAnd the words that people use sometimes\nare so awful that someone reading that,\nlike if you're in the demographic\nthat's being targeted, right?\nAnd you're reading that, I mean,\nhow does a person not feel, not feel,\nbe set upon vulnerable, right?\nAnd then I think that also fuels,\nthings like we just had this\nterrible shooting in Buffalo, right?\nLike just hate motivated, right?\nAnd I think that,\nbecause that kind of language\nbecomes very real to people\nwho may take it in,\nit fuels their hate and then\nthey do something to enact it,\nwhich of course creates greater feel\nand fear and vulnerability.\nAnd I think there was\nsome civility and decorum\nthat was in our world,\nnot that long ago, right?\nI mean, you know, I'm in my early fifties,\nI'm not that old, right?\nBut I remember a time\nwhen in political discourse,\nsay people were civil\nto one another, right?\nNow so much, I mean, it's\nnot all of it, right?\nBut there's an acceptance of things\nthat are just bombastic, right?\nIt's a circus side show sometimes\nof people being just angry and aggressive\nand it's not really linked to anything,\nalthough it's allegedly\nlinked to something,\nbut then other people's\nanger can attach to it.\nAnd it's not about what it's about,\nbut it's about aligning with the anger\nand I think that there is so much damage\nthat comes from that.\nAnd I think, should we have,\nshould it be okay that\npeople sometimes are talking,\ncommunicating, using language in ways\nthat would like get us suspended\nfrom middle school, right?\nWays I don't want my\neight year old to see,\nI mean, is that really okay?\nOr do we need to take a stand\nfor like rational use of language?\nI don't want my use of\nlanguage to be over controlled\nby someone who thinks\nthey sort of understand\nbetter than the rest of us\nhow to communicate with us.\nOkay, I don't want that.\nWhat's stereotypically\na sort of idea of the left say, right?\nAt least in our society,\nbut I also don't want,\nlanguage, it can be so angry\nand so aggressive that it is perpetuating\nor spreading vulnerability and\nthat it facilitates trauma.\nAnd I think we could set\nstandards as a society\nwhere we say, look, I\ndon't want anybody in power\nwho's going to behave that way, right?\nI don't care if their\nwhole agenda is like,\nmake Paul Conti's life better.\nI'm still not going to\nvote for you, right?\nIf you're behaving towards others\nin a way that's denigrating,\nyou're behaving in a way that I feel\nessentially ashamed of, right?\nAnd I feel that a lot, right?\nI see the politics, you\nknow, I see things play out.\nIt's not always political, of\ncourse not always political,\nbut I see things play out\nand I think, oh my gosh,\nI feel embarrassed.\nLike we we're somehow okay with this.\nWell, it doesn't matter which side\nof the political spectrum it's coming to.\nAnd I think that's an\nindicator that what we're doing\nis really hurtful to us.\nPeople become more angry.\nThey attach to the anger.\nPeople feel more beleaguered.\nThere's more divisions between us.\nAnd it seems more and more like,\nwell, we can only really\nidentify with people\nwho are just like us\nand like, what does that really mean?\nI mean, the divisions\nthat it creates between us\nand that promotes so many\nnegative things, right?\nI mean, think about ways\nin which it promotes\nwhite supremacy, right?\nIt's just one example, right?\nAnd we've seen that play out\nthat this is really bad for us.\nAnd we've got to look at that.\nI mean, if we don't look at that,\nI don't think something\nis going to happen.\nLike something is happening, right?\nIt's happening now.\n- Yeah, and I'm, it really, to my mind,\nit really seeps down into the soil\nof everything that we're talking about.\n- Yes.\n- On all sides.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- People are activated.\nPeople are upset about\none thing or the other.\n- Right.\n- No one is immune from upset\nregardless of political affiliation.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- Everybody seems to be upset nowadays.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- As I was hearing you talk about this,\nI feel a lot of resonance\nwith what you said\nand I also am hoping you run for office.\n- Thank you.\nI don't think I have the gumption for that\nbut thank you for.\n- [Andrew] Well, that would be wonderful.\n- Thank you.\nI'd like to talk about a concept\nof taking care of one's self.\nThis comes up in the book.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- This is something we talk\na lot about on this podcast.\nI mean, I think people have\nheard me blab endlessly,\nand I'll probably go into the grave\ntelling people to get sunlight\nin their eyes when they can\nand to try and get proper\nsleep and to have a few tools\nfor reducing their anxiety in real time\nand on and on and on.\n- [Paul] Right.\n- We hear about this concept\nof taking care of oneself\nand I think at a surface level,\nit can sound a little bit\nlight, you know, oh, take care,\ntake care, take good care.\nBut to me it's a deep\nand powerful concept.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- And I was very happy\nto see it in your book\nand also to learn a lot of ideas\nabout what that really looks like,\nbecause whether or not\nsomebody is in the early stages\nof considering whether\nor not they have trauma\nor is in the deep stages of working\nthat through or has made\nit through the tunnel\nsome distance taking care of oneself\nis an ongoing process.\n- [Paul] Yes.\n- I'd love for you to just describe\nwhat taking care of oneself\nmeans to you as a clinician.\nAnd of course the practices and things\nthat you encourage people to do.\nBut how should we think about taking care\nof oneself because on one extreme,\nyou could imagine massages\nor treats vacations\nand chefs for hire that\ntake care of everything\nfor ourselves.\nAnd on the other extreme, you could say,\nleaning into life in a way\nthat you're paying attention\nto small things while\nworking very, very hard.\nSo it's such a big concept,\nhow do you think about\ntaking care of one's self?\nHow should I take care of myself?\n- [Paul] Sure.\n- How should people\ntake care of themselves?\n- Sure.\n- I see here, what I think\nis a very fascinating dichotomy, right?\nThat in some ways, like,\nthink about how complex\nour brains are, right?\nHow complex our psyches,\nour unconscious minds are.\nThere's so much complexity\nthere, but on the other hand,\npsychological concepts that are consistent\nwith health are often very simple, right?\nWhich I don't mean light, right?\nBut simple, straightforward, right?\nAnd I think self-care is\nabsolutely one of them.\nI mean, how much is talked about,\nhow to take care of one self\nthat just skips over the basics\nthat are necessary as a\nbuilding block for all else.\nSo it doesn't matter how many\nchefs or vacations or whatever\na person has if the basics of\nself-care aren't squared away.\nAnd it's not a light concept to say like,\nare you sleeping enough, right?\nAre you eating well?\nAre you getting natural light?\nAre you interacting with people\nwho are good to interact with, right?\nAre you accepting negative\ninteractions in your life?\nAre you living in circumstances\nthat make you feel okay or not?\nThey're very basic premises,\nbut so often we're not\nlooking at them at all, right?\nWe're not looking at them at\nall because we tend to skip\nover them and we tend to\nskip over them either,\nbecause, again, in some automatic way\nthat sometimes is trauma driven\nor we're not going to look at that, right?\nAnd often not taking care of ourselves\ncan have the punishment\ndistraction, right?\nThere's so much that can come into that.\nOr our sense of power is,\nis tied to not taking care of ourselves.\nI mean, I'll give you\nan example is I tend to,\nfor whatever reason do reasonably well\nwith very poor self care, right?\nAnd like, that was very adaptive\nwhen I was into medical training, right?\nAnd I'm like, okay, I can eat a lot today.\nI can not eat, right?\nI can sleep two hours.\nI can sleep eight, right?\nI mean, overall, that's not good.\nAnd it hasn't been good\nfor me as I've aged.\nBut then I realized some look,\nI'm doing all these things\nto make myself healthier,\nbut like what, I ignored that, right?\nAnd why am I ignoring it?\nThat was a key question.\nWhy am I ignoring it?\nBecause somewhere inside of me, as it was,\nand still to some extent is,\nthis idea that my ability to\nbe really functional, right?\nTo generate success in the world around me\nis tied to my ability to do that, right?\nThat, oh, but if I stop\ndoing that and now I'm like,\nI'm eating and sleeping regularly,\nthen I'm going to lose some edge.\nSo even I think about this all the time,\nbut I realize,\nhey, I'm also, I'm not\ndoing it inside, you know?\nAnd I think it's really grounding\nto the basics that really help us of like,\nwhat are the basics of what I'm doing\nand not doing in my life, diet, exercise,\nsleep, people, circumstances,\nleisure activities.\nI mean, sunlight.\nI think immensely important\nand dramatically undervalued.\n- Well, I want to thank you for that.\nAnd I want to thank you\nfor today's discussion.\nI found it to be incredibly informative\nand I know our listeners will also.\nI also want to thank\nyou for the work you do.\nI mean, you obviously run an incredibly\nrobust clinical practice\nthat I'm aware that you're\nconstantly trying to improve,\neven though it's operating at\nthe highest levels already.\n- I appreciate that.\n- I really, the reason\nwhy you're here today\nis because I've done\na wide and deep search\nfor people in these areas.\nAnd there are so few who have\nthe background in medical\ntraining and physiology,\nin the psychoanalytic\nand psychiatric realm\nand also have a grounding\ntoward the future,\nof what's coming and who can encapsulate\nso many different orientations\nand bring them together\ninto a coherent piece.\nSo I really thank you.\n- I so appreciate that.\n- Yeah, and for your\nbook, which is incredible,\nI will go on record saying,\nI think this is the\ndefinitive book on trauma.\n- Wow, thank you.\n- And I really encourage people\nto read it and will continue\nto encourage people to read it.\nIt has so many valuable takeaways\nand insights and tools there.\nSo on behalf of the listeners and myself,\nthank you so much for joining us today.\n- You're very welcome.\nAnd I take that to heart\nand I'm very appreciative\nof being here, so you're very welcome\nand thank you as well.\n- Thank you.\nThank you for joining me\nfor my discussion with Dr. Paul Conti.\nI also highly recommend that\nyou explore his new book,\nwhich is \"Trauma: The Invisible Epidemic,\nHow Trauma Works and How\nWe Can Heal From It.\"\nIt's an exceptional resource,\nboth for those that have trauma\nand those that don't have trauma\nor those that suspect\nthey might have trauma.\nAgain, it's a deep dive\ninto what trauma is\nand offers many simple\ntools that anyone can apply\nwith a therapist or not, in\norder to heal from trauma.\nAnd if you'd like to\nlearn more about Dr. Conti\nand the work he does\ndirectly with patients,\nplease check out his website,\npacificpremieregroup.com.\nWe've also provided a\nlink to both the book\nand pacificpremieregroup.com\nin

discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like improving\nthe transition time\nand the depth of sleep each night,\nfor improving focus, for managing anxiety\nand for many other\naspects of mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nFor that reason,\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast has partnered\nwith Momentous supplements\nbecause first off,\nthey are of the very highest quality.\nThey also ship internationally,\nwhich many other supplement\ncompanies do not.\nAnd we wanted to have a one\nstop location where people could\nfind and access the\nsupplements that are discussed\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nSo if you go to\nlivemomentous.com/huberman,\nyou'll find many of the\nsupplements that are commonly\ndiscussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nI should just mention that the\ncatalog of supplements there\nwill be expanding in the\nweeks and months to follow,\nbut already a number of them for sleep\nand focus and other\naspects of mental health,\nphysical health and performance\nare already there at\nlivemomentous.com/huberman.\nIf you're not already following\nHuberman Lab on Instagram\nand Twitter, please do so.\nThere I cover science\nand science based tools,\nsome of which overlaps with the content\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut much of which is distinct\nfrom the information covered\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nWe also have a newsletter\ncalled the Neural Network Newsletter,\nwhere we offer distilled information.\nSo lists of protocols\nand key takeaways from podcast episodes.\nIf you want to sign up for the newsletter,\nall it requires is your email.\nPlease know that we do not\nshare your email with anybody.\nWe have a very clear privacy policy.\nYou can find all that by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com.\nThere's a menu there where you can sign up\nfor the Neural Network Newsletter.\nYou can also immediately get access\nto some example newsletters.\nSo you know what the\nnewsletter is all about.\nSo thank you once again for\njoining me for my discussion\nwith Dr. Paul Conti and last,\nbut certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat rock music]"
