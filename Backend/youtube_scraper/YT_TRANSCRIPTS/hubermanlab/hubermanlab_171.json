    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing grief.\nGrief is a natural emotion\nthat most everybody experiences\nat some point in their life.\nHowever, grief is something\nthat still mystifies most people.\nFor instance, we often wonder\nwhy getting over the loss\nof somebody, or a pet,\nis so absolutely crushing.\nIn some cases it's obvious,\nbecause we had a very close relationship\nto that person or animal,\nbut in other cases, it's bewildering,\nbecause somehow, despite our best efforts,\nwe are unable to reframe\nand shift our mind\nto the idea that the person or animal\nthat at one point was\nhere, and so very present,\nis now gone.\nToday we are going to discuss\nhow we conceptualize grief,\nboth at an emotional\nand at a logical level.\nI'm going to teach you\nabout the neuroscience\nand the psychology of grief,\nand incredible findings\nthat have been made\nin just a few key laboratories,\nthat point to the fact\nthat we essentially map\nour experience of people\nin three dimensions.\nI'll just give you a little hint\nof what those dimensions are.\nThey relate to space, where people are,\ntime, when people are,\nI'll explain what that means,\nand a dimension called closeness,\nand how those three dimensions\nof space, time, and closeness\nare what establish very\nclose bonds with people,\nand are what require remapping,\nreorganization within\nour emotional framework\nand our logical framework,\nwhen we lose somebody,\nfor whatever reason.\nWithin that understanding,\nI'm confident that you\nwill have greater insight\ninto the grief process.\nAnd should you ever find yourself\nwithin the grief process,\nas I imagine most everyone\nwill at some point,\nyou will be able to navigate that process\nin what psychologists and\nneuroscientists deem to be\nthe most healthy way\nof going through grief.\nIndeed, moving through grief\nrequires a specific\nform of neuroplasticity,\na reordering of brain connections,\nand also the connections\nbetween the brain and body.\nI'm going to teach you\nabout all of that today,\nso you're going to learn a\nlot of scientific information.\nYou will also learn a lot of tools\nthat you can put in your kit\nof emotional and really,\nemotional physical tools,\nthat will allow you to move through grief\nin this healthy way that\nI referred to earlier.\nI'll also point out some\nof the myths about grief.\nFor instance, many of\nyou have probably heard\nthat there are designated stages of grief\nthat everybody moves through.\nTurns out that recent\nresearch refutes that idea.\nThere are different stages of grief,\nbut not everybody experiences all of them,\nand hardly ever does somebody\nmove through all of those linearly,\nmeaning in the same order.\nI also want to point\nout that for many of you\nthat are not experiencing\ngrief in this moment,\nthere's an important scientific literature\nthat teaches us that\nhow we show up to grief,\nmeaning our psychological\nand our biological state\nthat we happen to be\nin when a loss occurs,\nstrongly dictates whether or not we end up\nin what's called complicated\nor non-complicated grief.\nAnd non-complicated\ngrief is a form of grief\nthat is very prolonged,\nand in fact often requires\nthat people get substantial\nprofessional help.\nSo whether or not you're\nexperiencing grief that's mild,\nmoderate, or very intense right now,\nor whether or not you are not\nexperiencing any grief at all,\nyou're going to learn\nscientific information\nand tools that will help you navigate\nthrough this process that we call grief.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress\ncovers that have cooling,\nheating, and sleep tracking capabilities.\nI recently started sleeping\nwith an Eight Sleep mattress cover,\nand I am so glad that I did,\nbecause the sleep that\nI'm getting is superb\ncompared to the sleep I\nwas getting previously.\nI always thought that I slept pretty well,\nespecially since I apply a\nnumber of different tools\nin order to sleep well,\nthings like supplements,\nthings like keeping the\nroom cool, et cetera.\nBut I have had a repeating\nproblem over the years,\nwhich is that I would wake up\nin the middle of the night often,\nand sometimes have a bit of trouble\nor a lot of trouble getting back to sleep.\nI would have to apply other tools\nin order to get back to sleep.\nEight Sleep allows me to\nadjust the temperature\nof my mattress and my\nsleeping environment,\nso that I fall asleep easily,\nand stay asleep throughout the night,\nwhich as many of you\nknow is a game changer.\nTemperature is a powerful\nregulator of sleep\nand the ability to get into sleep.\nWe know, for instance,\nthat the body needs to drop\nby one to three degrees\nin order to get into\nsleep and to stay asleep.\nAnd with Eight Sleep,\nI can program the temperature of my bed\nso that it gets cooler as I fall asleep,\ngets even colder as I enter deep sleep,\nand at the transition to REM sleep,\nrapid eye movement sleep, it\ncan get even cooler if I like.\nI actually like to maintain\nthe same temperature\nthrough deep and REM sleep.\nAnd then it heats up slightly\nas I head towards morning,\nbecause of course heating up of the body\nis one way in which we wake up.\nSo I have this nice contour\nof cooling and heating\nthat puts me through a beautiful arc\nof falling and staying asleep,\nand waking up when I want to.\nIf you want to try Eight Sleep,\nyou can go to eightsleep.com/huberman,\nand check out the Pod Pro Cover,\nand save more

from\nyour blood and DNA,\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for instance,\nwhat your biological\nage is, and compare that\nto your chronological age.\nAnd of course your biological age\nis the number that truly matters.\nOne issue with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you get values back\nabout metabolic factors,\nhormones, and lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker solves that problem.\nThey have a very easy-to-use\npersonalized platform.\nIt's a website where you can\nliterally place your cursor\nover a given value,\nsay for a hormone or\nmetabolic factor or lipid,\nand it will tell you what you can do\nin terms of nutrition,\nbehaviors, and supplementation\nin order to bring those\nvalues into the range\nthat are optimal for you and your health.\nFind this immensely useful\nand very easy to use.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's

have extreme versatility\nin terms of what they can be used for,\nand when you wear them.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, the company was founded\nby two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\nand their goal was to develop\neyeglasses for performance,\nthings like running and\nbiking and so forth.\nAnd you can certainly wear\nthem for those activities.\nAnd I do wear them for those activities.\nI wear readers at night.\nI also wear sunglasses sometimes,\nwhen it's very bright out.\nOne of the things that's terrific\nabout ROKA sunglasses\nand eyeglasses, however,\nis that they're not\njust designed for sport.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic,\nand you can also wear them out to dinner,\nto work, and so on.\nI say this because at least in my opinion,\na lot of so-called sport eyeglasses\nor high-performance\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nmake people look like cyborgs.\nROKA, the aesthetic is really terrific.\nThey're extremely lightweight\nand they don't slip off,\neven when you're sweaty.\nSo you can indeed wear them on a hot day,\nor when running or cycling.\nThey're not going to slip off your face.\nThey're so lightweight, in fact,\nthat I often forget\nthat they're on my face.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nsunglasses or eyeglasses,\ngo to roka.com, that's roka.com,\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off on your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com,\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nOkay, let's talk about grief.\nI just want to remind you that everybody,\nat some point in their\nlife, experiences grief,\neither mild grief, moderate\ngrief, or extreme grief,\nand it's somewhat obvious,\nbut worth stating nonetheless,\nthat how intense grief feels,\nand how long it lasts,\nscales with how close\nwe were with somebody.\nAnd if you learn that the person\nwho works at the coffee shop\nor that you see at the coffee\nshop on a regular basis,\nhappened to pass away\nor tragically get killed\nin a car accident,\nthat can be quite upsetting.\nIt can be somewhat disorienting to you\nif you, for instance,\njust saw them yesterday\nor they seemed perfectly\nfine when you saw them last.\nBut of course the grief that results\nfrom the loss of somebody\nto whom you have that level of attachment\nis far and away different\nthan the level of grief\nthat you would experience\nfrom the death of a very close loved one,\na sibling, a parent, God forbid a child.\nWhen that type of loss occurs,\nit's often the case\nthat our entire relationship\nto life feels different.\nPlaces and things that at once\nbrought us joy and laughter\nnow bring the opposite.\nThey bring us intense\nfeelings of sadness and loss.\nPsychologists and neuroscientists\ndistinguish between complicated grief\nand non-complicated grief.\nThey are very similar at the outset.\nOne of the fundamental\ndifferences between them, however,\nis that complicated grief,\nwhich occurs in about one in 10 people,\nis a situation in which grief\ndoes not seem to resolve itself,\neven after a prolonged period of time.\nLater in the episode, I'll point you\nto the actual tests that are used.\nI've provided links to those\nin the show note captions,\nthat will allow you to distinguish\nbetween complicated and\nnon-complicated grief.\nThese arrive through\nthe important research\nof the world-class grief\nresearchers that are out there\nand the psychologists that treat grief.\nThe important thing to point\nout is that grief is a process.\nLike any biological or\npsychological event,\nit has a beginning, a middle and an end.\nAnd I do believe that being able to orient\nin terms of where you are in that process\ncan be immensely beneficial,\nnot just for predicting how\nlong it's going to last,\nbut in order to conceptualize\nthe person or animal\nthat you lost, in a way that allows you\nto best preserve their memory\nwhile maintaining your own\nfunctional capacity in life.\nAlong those lines, I want to point out\nthat grief and depression,\nwhile they can feel quite\nsimilar in certain ways,\nand have overlapping symptomatology,\nloss of appetite, challenges sleeping,\ncrying in the middle of the day\nfor no apparent reason, et cetera,\nthey are distinctly different processes.\nThe modern research\nteaches us for instance,\nthat grief rarely responds\nwell to antidepressants,\nwhereas depression can often\nrespond well to antidepressants.\nEverything we know and\nunderstand about grief\nis that it is a distinct psychological\nand physiological event\nin the brain and body from depression.\nRather, perhaps the best\nway to think about grief\nis that it is actually\na motivational state.\nIt is a yearning.\nIt is a desire for something,\nand somewhat surprisingly,\nit's not just a desire\nto have that person back,\nor to have that animal back.\nYou might think, \"Well, that's\ncrazy, of course it is.\"\nBut of course, there are instances\nin which someone passing away\nor an animal passing away\nis actually providing\nrelief for that person,\nbecause of where they\nhappen to be in their life.\nToday, I'll teach you about\ngrief as a motivational process,\nbecause grief as a motivational process\nreally is the way that\nscientists and psychologists\nnow conceptualize grief, and\nthe treatments for grief,\nso that people can move\nthrough them effectively.\nAs we wade into this important topic,\nI'd like to emphasize\nsome of the common myths\nand misunderstandings about grief.\nSome of the myths and\nmisunderstanding arrive\nfrom the beautiful work\nof Elisabeth Kubler-Ross,\na psychologist who wrote the\nfamous book on death and dying.\nAnd I should emphasize\nthat while Kubler-Ross\nwas a real pioneer in establishing\nthat there are indeed\ndifferent stages of grief,\nthe modern science, both\npsychology and neuroscience,\npoint to the fact that not everybody\nexperiences all of the stages\nthat Kubler-Ross defined,\nnor do they move through those\nstages in a linear manner.\nSometimes they're out of sequence.\nI'll just highlight the five stages\nthat Kubler-Ross illustrated,\nbecause some people really\ndo experience all of them,\nsometimes in the order I'll read them.\nBut again, oftentimes they don't.\nThe different stages\nof grief, very quickly,\nare denial, anger, bargaining,\ndepression, and acceptance.\nIn the Kubler-Ross model,\ndenial is always the first stage,\nand denial is just as it sounds,\nthis disbelief, it cannot\nbe, there's no way,\na refusal to accept the new reality\nthat the person or animal is gone.\nThe second stage, anger,\nis one in which the individual recognizes\nthat the person is indeed gone,\nor the animal is gone,\nbut their body and their mind\ngo into a motivated state.\nThis is important.\nWe're going to return\nto this idea of grief\nas a motivated state that\ninvolves action plans,\nin more depth as we go further.\nAnd then the third stage is bargaining,\nwhat's sometimes called\nthe negotiating phase,\nthis idea that, well,\nif I had just done this,\nor if they had just done that,\nor if I had called more,\nor somehow refusing to accept the reality.\nSo in a way this can be blended\nwith denial in thinking,\n\"Well, if I just don't think about it,\nit won't be real,\" this kind of thing.\nSo again, stages can be\nblended or braided together,\nbecause emotions are complex, right?\nEven though there are different\nstages to this process,\nthey can sometimes be melded together.\nThe fourth stage of depression\nthat Kubler-Ross described\nis one of, why go on living?\nWhy should I go on living?\nWhy should I continue in\nthis grief-stricken state\nthat seems to deprive me\nof all the richness of life\nthat I experienced when the\nperson or animal was still here.\nAnd then the fifth stage is acceptance.\nThis internalization,\nnot just cognitively,\nnot just thinking,\nbut emotionally that\nit's going to be okay,\nthat not just this too shall\npass, but that it has passed.\nSo again, the five stages of grief\nthat Kubler-Ross defined\nwere immensely important\nas a critical parsing\nof the different stages\nthat one could move through.\nBut unfortunately those five stages\nwere sort of taken to be\ngospel for a long time.\nAnd we now know, based on neuroimaging,\nbased on more in-depth\npsychological evaluation,\nand frankly, more\nresearchers and clinicians\nmoving into this area and observing\nthat while much of what\nKubler-Ross described\ndoes hold true, it's not always the case.\nAnd in fact, the contour\nof the grief process\nactually has a lot of dimensions\nthat are not encapsulated\nby those five stages.\nThere's also a lot of variation,\ndepending on whether or not the loss\nis due to old age, disease,\nwhether or not there was\nsuffering prior or not,\nsuicide or non-suicide\ntype deaths and losses,\nand even grief about non-death losses,\na relationship breakup,\nor something of that sort,\nor even homesickness\nand things of that sort.\nSo I do want to tip our\nhats to the incredible work\nof Elisabeth Kubler-Ross.\nBy no means am I or do other researchers\ntry and discount her\nincredible contributions.\nBut I think nowadays we have\na different and frankly,\na better understanding of what\nthe grief process is like,\nand as a consequence, better\ntools to move through grief.\nIn order to really\nunderstand what grief is\nin your brain and body,\nand how to best navigate grief,\nI'd like you to do an experiment with me.\nFor the next five minutes or so,\nI'd like you to at least try to discard\nof all prior notions of grief\nas just a state of sadness.\nI want to acknowledge that it is\nand does involve sadness,\nbut for right now,\nlet's think about grief\nas a motivational state,\nas a desire for something specific.\nIn fact, I'd like you to think about grief\nas an attempt to reach out\nand get something that you very much want.\nImagine yourself extremely\nthirsty, for instance,\non a very hot day,\nand a glass of water is\nright in front of you.\nAnd it's a beautiful,\nclean glass of water,\nand it's completely full,\nand you so badly want to drink that water.\nBut no matter how intensely you want it,\nand no matter how hard\nyou try and reach it,\nit always shifts just outside your reach.\nSo if you can imagine that,\neven just a little bit,\nyou are touching into\nthe experience of grief.\nHow do I know this?\nWell, I know this because\nbrain imaging studies\ninvolving what's called\nfunctional magnetic\nresonance imaging, FMRI,\nin which you can evaluate\nwhich brain areas are\nmore active than others,\naccording to blood flow,\nwhich correlates with neural\nactivity and so forth,\nteaches us that the brain areas\nthat are associated with\nmotivation and craving and pursuit\nare some of the primary\nbrain areas and circuits\nthat are activated in states of grief.\nI'd like to share an\nimportant paper with you,\nas one of the first to illustrate the fact\nthat grief is not just a\nstate of sadness and pain.\nIt is indeed a state of\nyearning and desire of something\nthat is just outside your reach,\nand unfortunately will always\nbe just outside your reach\nuntil you remap your relationship\nto that person or thing.\nThe title of this paper is\nposed first as a question,\nso that's why I'll read it as such.\nThe title is \"Craving Love?\nEnduring Grief Activates\nBrain's Reward Center.\"\nAnd the first author of this paper\nis Mary-Frances O'Connor.\nShe's a professor of psychology\nat the University of Arizona,\nand one of the world leaders\nin the study of grief\nfrom a neuroscience perspective.\nWith some luck, we'll get her here\non the podcast as a guest.\nNow this paper has several\nimportant features.\nI'll just highlight a few.\nOne of the features of this\npaper that's not surprising\nis they found that people\nwho are in a state of grief\nare in a state of pain.\nThat is, brain areas associated with pain,\nactual physical pain, are more active\nthan in non-grieving individuals.\nHowever, they also found that\npeople who are experiencing\nwhat's called complicated grief\nshowed reward-related activity\nin a brain area called\nthe nucleus accumbens.\nWhat is reward-related activity?\nReward-related activity\nis activity of neurons\nthat's associated with\nmotivational states.\nAnd the nucleus accumbens\nis a brain center\nin which dopamine has the effect\nof creating a motivated state.\nIf ever you thought that dopamine\nwas only associated with feeling good,\nyou hear about dopamine hits,\nwell, this paper and papers like it,\nfirmly tell us that dopamine\nis not about feeling good.\nDopamine is about placing us into a state\nof desiring things and seeking things.\nThis is true in addiction.\nThis is true when we're\nhungry and we want to eat.\nThis is true when we want to reproduce.\nThis is true in every state\nin which we are reaching for something\noutside our immediate ability\nto give that thing to ourselves.\nThis is very important to understand,\nif you want to understand grief\nand how to move through grief.\nGrief is not just about sadness.\nIt is a state of sadness,\nhence the activation of brain\nareas associated with pain,\nand it is a state of desire\nand reaching for something.\nAnd for those of you that\nhave experienced grief,\nI think that will resonate with you.\nIn that understanding that\ngrief is both a state of pain,\nbut also a state of wanting,\nand in the understanding\nthat when we lose somebody,\neither because of breakup\nor because of death,\nor if an animal dies or gets\ntaken away or is missing,\nthat state of wanting and desire\ndrives an activation state within us.\nNow, the key thing to understand\nis that the activation\nof those reward centers,\nand the involvement of dopamine\nputs us into an anticipatory state,\na state of waiting for\nsomething to happen.\nIt also puts us into a state\nof action or desiring action.\nOur body and our mind\nare what I like to refer to\nas center of mass forward.\nWe are seeking how to resolve the craving,\neven if we know that is impossible.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, we understand,\nalso on the basis of\nbrain imaging studies,\nand also some studies in animals\nthat I'll describe in a moment,\nthat in order to understand grief,\nwe have to understand how attachments\nare represented in our brain.\nAnd it turns out that both attachments\nand the breaking of\nattachments in healthy ways\nare governed by three important,\nwhat we call dimensions.\nA dimension is just some\nfeature of the world\nthat's represented in our brain.\nSo for instance, the color red\ndoesn't exist in your brain.\nYou happen to have cells,\nneurons, in your eye\nthat respond best to long\nwavelengths of light.\nAnd those long wavelengths of light\nhappen to be what are reflected off things\nthat are perceived as red.\nSo in your mind, you have a notion of red.\nI know this is a little bit abstract,\nbut you're not actually\nlighting up red neurons\nin your brain, and that's why you see red.\nYou are lighting up neurons in your brain\nthat represent the presence of red things\nin your environment.\nSimilarly, we have neurons and maps,\nor we say representations\nof other dimensions.\nWe have dimensions of touch.\nWe have dimensions of sound.\nAnd as I'll now teach you,\nwe have three dimensions\nthat define our relationship\nto people and animals and things.\nAnd when those people, animals and things\nare within our immediate vicinity,\nor if we know how we\ncould access them, right?\nIf somebody's still alive,\nthere's generally some way to access them,\nunless they're refusing\nto interact with us.\nWell, when we understand that,\nour motivational states can operate\nin a way that's logical.\nWe know that, for instance,\nif we want to find our\nmother, brother, sister,\nsignificant other, dog,\ncat, parrot, et cetera,\nwe have to go through\na certain set of steps.\nWhat are those three dimensions\nand how do they work?\nAnd that's what I'm\ngoing to teach you now.\nSo at risk of sounding a\nlittle bit too reductionist,\nwe are now going to\ndescribe your relationship\nto anything, everything, and anyone,\nin these three dimensions.\nHow can we do that?\nWhy would we even want to do that?\nWhy would we want to rob the\ncomplexity of relationships\nof their contour and their detail?\nWell, if we can understand the dimensions\nin which we map our relationship\nto people, animals, and things,\nthen we can understand why\nit is that when those people,\nanimals, or things are\nnot accessible to us,\nwhy it hurts so much,\nand why it takes a certain amount of time\nin order to re-understand, if you will,\nor remap our association to them.\nI promise that in grasping the information\nI'm about to give you,\nyou will be able to better\norient in the grief process,\nand you'll be able to move\nthrough it more effectively.\nThe three dimensions\nof relating to someone,\nor an animal, or a thing,\nare space, time, and closeness.\nAnd in order to illustrate each one\nand how they work together\nto support relationships\nand their involvement\nin the grieving process,\nI'm going to tell you about an experiment.\nThis experiment was actually done.\nThe experiment involves putting\npeople into a brain scanner\nthat allows the researcher to evaluate\nbrain activity in different areas.\nIn fact, can look in\na very non-biased way,\nnot make any predictions\nabout which brain areas\nare going to be involved.\nAnd the experiment is the following.\nThe person, we should\nsay the research subject,\nfirst sees images of things that reside\nat different distances from one another.\nAnd when I say things, these are objects.\nSo in one case it's a\nbeach or a parking lot\nwith bowling balls set\nat different distances from one another.\nTheir brain is imaged,\nand as their brain is imaged,\nthey see different pictures\nof different scenes,\nthe beach, the parking lot, et cetera,\nbowling balls spaced in different ways,\nclose together, far apart,\nregularly spaced, non-regularly spaced.\nWhen one does this sort of experiment,\nyou see a lot of brain areas activated.\nNot surprisingly, the visual cortex,\nthe area of the brain that is responsible\nfor creating visual perceptions,\nbut also a brain area\nthat seems uniquely tuned\nto the distance between\nyou and the objects.\nSo whether or not the\nbowling balls are far away\nor close together from one another,\nand whether or not they are far away\nor close to you physically,\nso literally the distance\nbetween you and these objects.\nWe'll refer to that measure,\nthat dimension, as we call\nit, as proximity, okay?\nWhether or not it's very close to you,\nhigh degree of proximity,\nor far away, low proximity.\nBut it's simply physical space.\nThen subjects listened to tones.\nThose tones also are\nspaced from one another.\nSo it could be something as simple as\nmy hand meeting the table top\nthat I'm happen to be sitting in front of.\nSo it's [hand hits].\nThey image the brain.\nOf course, areas of the brain\nthat are associated with\nauditory perception are active,\nnot surprisingly, but as they evaluate\ndifferent types of sounds\nand patterns of sounds,\nfor instance, [hand hits]\nthey can start to parse brain areas\nthat seem uniquely tuned\nto the spacing of sounds,\nindependent of what sounds are coming in.\nSo whether or not it's musical notes,\nor my hand hitting the\ntable, or human speech,\nthey identified a brain\nregion that is uniquely tuned.\nThat is, it becomes active\nspecifically in response\nto changes in the spacing between sounds,\nmuch in the same way as they\ncould identify brain regions\nthat were only activated\nwhen there were changes in\nthe distance between objects,\nsuch as the bowling balls\nthat I used in the previous example.\nAnd then the subjects saw\na different set of images.\nThe images that they saw\nwere of people, and of faces.\nAnd some of the images that they saw\nwere of people's faces right up close,\nand other images were\nof people at a distance,\nwhere you could see the\nwhole body of the person.\nNow, they also varied\nthe emotional relationship\nto those people.\nThat is, they were able to get photographs\nfrom these research subjects' lives,\nso they could show them\npictures of, for instance,\ntheir sister or some random\nperson off the street.\nThey could show them pictures of a parent,\nor of a neighbor,\nor of a celebrity that's well known,\nor of somebody that\nthey didn't know at all.\nSo they were able to vary\nboth the position of the\nperson, close or far,\nand they were able to vary\nthe emotional distance to the person,\nwhich is this dimension that\nI'm referring to as closeness,\nwhich is not physical closeness,\nbut how attached, or how\nwell you know somebody.\nNow, this is maybe sounding like\na somewhat complicated experiment,\nbut the takeaway from this experiment\nis exquisitely simple,\nand exquisitely important.\nThe result was, that in\nall three conditions,\nchanges in the physical\nspacing of these objects,\nchanges in the temporal,\nthat is, the time spacing of these sounds,\nand changes in the emotional distance\nbetween the subject and different people,\nthe same brain area\nwas uniquely activated.\nNow that is an incredible thing to find,\nbecause what it suggests is that, yes,\nof course there are brain areas\nthat are associated with\nrepresentation of visual objects,\nand that yes, of course\nthere are brain areas\nassociated with representation\nof different sounds.\nAnd of course, there are brain\nareas associated with faces.\nWe now know this.\nIn fact, there's something\ncalled the fusiform face area,\nwhich is uniquely tuned to faces.\nBut at the same time,\nthere is a unique brain\nregion that is activated\nin all three of the\nconditions I described,\nthat has to do with how\nfar you are from somebody,\nboth in space, in time,\nand in terms of emotional closeness.\nAnd that brain area, it turns out,\nis a brain area called the\ninferior parietal lobule,\nthe inferior parietal lobule.\nNow, you don't need to know\nwhere the inferior parietal lobule is.\nIn fact, you don't even need to know\nthe name of this brain area.\nWhat you do need to know, however,\nif you want to understand grief\nand how to move through grief,\nis that your map of people is not a map\nof emotional closeness per se.\nIt is a map of emotional closeness,\nwhat we call attachment,\nthat is interwoven, that is braided in,\nin a very intimate way, with your map\nof where they are in physical space,\nand where they are in time,\nwhen you saw them last,\nwhen you're likely to see them again,\nand if you were to want to see them,\nhow much time it would take to reach them,\nor for them to reach you.\nNow earlier, I said that\none of the key functions\nof our nervous system\nis to be able to make predictions.\nAnd so it's somewhat obvious,\nbut nonetheless important\nto state and restate\nthat one of the most powerful aspects\nof our attachments to\npeople, animals, and things\nis our ability to predict\nwhat it would take\nto see them again, and when we\nare going to see them again.\nIn fact, we could say that our ability\nto locate someone, or\nan animal, or a thing\nin space and time, right,\nwhere they are and how\nlong it would take for us\nto reach them or them to reach us,\nis a prediction of the requirements\nto engage in the attachment.\nIn order to illustrate this\nat a little bit more depth,\nlet's just do a fill in\nthe blank experiment.\nYou can do this now in real time.\nI want you to think of somebody\nthat you either rely on\nor that you care about very, very much.\nAnd I'll just allow you\nto fill in the blank on this sentence.\n\"If I want to see blank,\"\nthe person or animal,\n\"I could see them within\nblank amount of time,\" right?\nIf right now you wanted to\nsee this person or animal,\nor maybe even a thing,\nhow long would it take you to reach them?\nCould be a day, could be a second,\ncould be they're right next to you.\nAll you'd have to do is turn your head.\nNow answer this.\n\"If this person were to travel\nhalfway around the world,\nand land in their plane,\nI would expect to hear from them\nwithin blank minutes of them landing.\"\nOkay, the answers of this\nof course, will differ.\nNow, I'd like you to answer this question.\n\"If I'd like to find myself,\nit would take me X amount of time.\"\nAnd of course, if you're listening to this\nand you're understanding it\nand you're of a rational mind,\nthe answer to that should be\nzero seconds, instantaneous.\nYou are always able to locate\nyourself in space and time,\nprovided you are in the\nappropriate state of mind,\nmeaning not asleep, for instance.\nThat last question might\nseem somewhat silly,\nbut it's a fundamentally important one,\nbecause it illustrates the extremes\nat which we map our\nrelationship to ourselves\nrelative to other people and things.\nNow, if all of this sounds\nlike a bunch of neuropsycho babble,\nparsing of the obvious,\nI'd encourage you to suspend\nthat belief for the moment.\nBecause if you understand\nthat all relationships\nare mapped in the brain and body\nthrough these three dimensions,\nspace, time, and closeness,\nor proximity of space, proximity in time,\nand proximity of attachment,\nhow close or rich or\nbonded you are to someone,\nwell, if you can understand that,\nthen it almost becomes obvious,\nor at least it becomes intuitive,\nas to why, after the loss of somebody,\nin particular, a death,\nor the loss of an animal,\nthis map has to be reordered.\nWhy, because if we are attached\nto someone, or an animal,\nat a deep level,\nit is almost always on the basis\nof a lot of what we call\nepisodic experience,\na lot of episodic memories,\nmemories of things that happen.\nEpisodic memories are literally\nthe conscious recollection of\nyour experience of somebody,\nor an animal, or a thing.\nAnd within that memory,\nyou have an understanding of\nwhat has happened with them\nin association to you,\nwhat's going on with them,\nwhere it happened, when it happened.\nYou have a rich knowledge database\nthat we call implicit knowledge, right?\nYou might not be aware of it all the time,\nbut it's within you, of\nwhat this person is like\nand what they're doing in their life.\nWhen somebody is taken away\nfrom us, for whatever reason,\nepisodic memories persist\nfor some period of time,\nand they are still linked to\nour feelings of attachment.\nGrief is the process of\nuncoupling, unbraiding,\nand untangling that relationship\nbetween where people\nare in space, in time,\nand our attachment to them.\nWhat I mean by this is\nwhen somebody or an animal\nor a thing is taken from us,\neither by decision or by\ndeath, or by circumstance,\nwell, in that case, our entire memory bank\nand our ability to predict\nwhere and when they will be,\nand therefore when we can feed\nour attachment to them again,\nthat whole map is obliterated,\nexcept that the attachment\nitself has not been disrupted.\nAssuming that you are\ndeeply attached to someone\nor an animal or a thing,\nthat attachment persists,\nand the grief process is one\nin which you have to reorder\nyour understanding of them\nin space and in time.\nThis is very, very hard to do,\nand for some people it's\nalmost impossible to do,\nat least at the outset of grief.\nThis, in a very neurosciencey way,\nexplains this stage that\nKubler-Ross described,\nwhich many, again, not all,\nbut many people experience,\nwhich is one of denial.\nHow could it be, why?\nWell, when we have a rich catalog\nof experiences with\nsomebody or of them, right,\nideas about them and what they do,\nhow they spend their day,\nwhat they do and don't do,\nwhere they do it, et cetera,\nwell, that memory bank\nis not just flushed out\nthe moment that we learn that\nthey're no longer with us.\nWhat happens is, the brain continues\nto make these predictions\nthat they will be in a certain place\nor a certain time, right,\nthat they'll be in a certain time zone\nor they'll walk in the door any moment.\nAll of those predictions still hold.\nThe neural activity continues.\nWe call this reverberatory activity.\nThat explains the yearning for,\nand the desire to interact,\nand yet it's just beyond our reach.\nBecause once they're gone,\nour brain still functions in a way,\nthese neural circuits\nstill function in a way\nthat put us into an action\nstate of seeking them,\nlooking for them in the same location,\nexpecting them to contact\nus at whatever frequency\nthat we were used to hearing from them,\nor that we could reach out to them\nand reliably get a response.\nIt is immensely\ndisorienting, in other words,\nto maintain a close attachment,\nand at the same time to not\nbe able to make predictions\nabout where that person, animal,\nor thing is in space and time.\nNow, if this seems somewhat abstract,\nI'm going to continue to flesh it out.\nAnd actually right now,\nI'd like to flesh it out\nwith a real-world\nexample of grief and loss\nthat comes to us from perhaps\none of the greatest\nminds in human history,\nand somebody who was intensely grounded\nin reality and logic, and\nindeed the physics of the world.\nAnd the person I'm referring\nto is none other than\nthe Nobel Prize-winning\nphysicist, Richard Feynman.\nMany of you are probably\nfamiliar with Richard Feynman.\nSome of you perhaps are not.\nRichard Feynman was a Nobel\nPrize-winning physicist,\nknown for his thick New York accent.\nHe was actually not from\nBrooklyn, as many people think.\nHe was actually from Far\nRockaway in Long Island.\nThick New York accent, very personable,\nexceptional teacher, brilliant mind,\nhence the Nobel Prize in physics.\nAlso a quite funny and amusing person,\ntold great anecdotes, et cetera.\nFeynman had a childhood sweetheart\nwho turned out to be his first wife.\nHer name was Arline, and it was well known\nthat Feynman was absolutely\nin love with her.\nHe would talk about her all the time.\nShe had a profound influence\non him and his thinking,\nand ultimately on his public\neducation efforts later.\nIf you haven't already read books such as\n\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman,\"\nor \"What Do You Care\nWhat Other People Think,\"\nI encourage you to do so.\nAnd in fact, that quote,\n\"What do you care what\nother people think,\"\nis actually a quote, not of Feynman,\nbut of his first wife, Arline,\nwho sadly, died at a very\nyoung age from tuberculosis.\nWhy am I sharing Feynman's story\nof loss of his first bride?\nWell, the reason is, Feynman continued\nto write letters to Arline\nfor a long period of time.\nThis is well known only\nbecause after Feynman died,\nit was discovered that he kept an archive\nof letters to his deceased first wife.\nAnd even though he did eventually marry,\nand in fact had many\nrelationships with many people,\nand I think was married twice more,\nmaybe it was once, maybe it was twice,\nthe intensity of his grief,\nbut also his lack of ability\nto transition his mind\nto a place where he understood\nthat Arline had died,\nis one of the more profound examples\nof this inability to reconcile\nthe logical world and the emotional world.\nAnd I'm now going to read to you a letter\nthat Feynman wrote to Arline.\nThis was discovered after Feynman's death,\nwhen they went through his\ndesk and his belongings.\nAnd as I read this, you're going to hear\nsome of the typical narrative of grief\nthat is not unique to\nFeynman and his dead wife,\nbut there are also some elements in there\nthat I think you'll recognize\nas highlighting this disbelief\nand this dissociation\nbetween the reality of somebody's location\nin space and time,\nand the emotional attachment\nthat they hold for us.\nAnd therein lies the information\nabout how to better navigate grief.\nSo now I'm reading from the letter.\nThis was a letter dated\nOctober 17th, 1946.\nIt's not terribly long, but bear with me.\n\"Dear Arline, I adore you, sweetheart.\nI know how much you like to hear that,\nbut I don't only write\nit because you like it.\nI write it because it makes\nme warm all over inside\nto write it to you.\nIt is such a terribly long time\nsince I last wrote to\nyou, almost two years,\nbut I know you'll excuse me,\nbecause you understand how I am,\nstubborn and realistic,\nand I thought there was\nno sense to writing.\nBut now I know, my darling wife,\nthat it is the right thing to do,\nwhat I have delayed in doing,\nand that I have done so much in the past.\nI wanted to tell you I love you.\nI want to love you.\nI will always love you.\"\nSo here we can hear the\nintense emotional attachment\nthat clearly has persisted.\n\"I find it hard to understand in my mind\nwhat it means to love\nyou after you are dead,\nbut I still want to comfort\nand take care of you.\nAnd I want you to love me and care for me.\nI want to have problems\nto discuss with you.\nI want to do little projects with you.\nI never thought until just\nnow that we can do that.\nWhat should we do?\nWe started to learn to\nmake clothes together,\nor learn Chinese, or\ngetting a movie projector.\nCan't I do something now?\nNo, I am alone without you,\nand you were the idea woman\nand the general instigator\nof all our wild adventures.\nWhen you were sick,\nyou worried because you could not give me\nsomething that you wanted,\nand you thought I needed.\nYou needn't have worried.\nJust as I told you then,\nthere was no real need,\nbecause I loved you in\nso many ways so much.\nAnd now it is clearly even more true.\nYou can give me nothing now,\nyet I love you so that\nyou stand in the way\nof my loving anything else.\nBut I wanted you to stand there.\nYou, dead, are so much better\nthan anyone else alive.\"\nSo you can really appreciate the depth\nand intensity of the attachment.\nDespite two years' time,\nit clearly has not waned.\nI'll read the final paragraph now.\n\"I know you'll assure\nme that I am foolish,\nand that you want me\nto have full happiness,\nand don't want to be in my way.\nI bet you are surprised\nthat I don't even have a girlfriend,\nexcept you sweetheart, after two years,\nbut you can't help it, darling, nor can I.\nI don't understand it,\nfor I've met many girls,\nand very nice ones, and I\ndon't want to remain alone.\nBut in two or three meetings,\nthey all seem ashes.\nYou only are left to me.\nYou are real.\nMy darling wife, I do adore you.\nI love my wife.\nMy wife is dead.\nRich.\nP.S., please excuse my not mailing this,\nbut I don't know your new address.\"\nSo there's a lot contained in this letter.\nWe could parse it line by line,\nbut I think it's fair to say that clearly,\nthere's an immense attachment\nthat's been maintained.\nSo that's that dimension\nof closeness of attachment.\nClearly, there's an\nunderstanding that she's dead.\nIn fact, the last line\nof this love letter is,\n\"My wife is dead,\" right?\nHe now moves her into the\nthird person, in fact,\nin that final line.\nSo he understands this,\nand yet he maintains the attachment.\nAnd the very last portion\nof the letter, the P.S.,\nthe postscript, \"I don't know\nyour new address,\" right?\nSomewhat humorous in the typical vein\nof a Feynman writing or speech.\nHe always had a intensely amusing\nand playful sense of humor.\nAnd yet there's something\nreally contained in this.\nI don't think we're\nreading into this too much,\nin that he doesn't know where to find her.\nHe feels her as very real,\nand yet he doesn't know where to find her.\nHe doesn't know her address.\nHe obviously knows she's dead,\nso there's nowhere to mail it to.\nThe reason I shared this letter with you,\nas opposed to one of the\nalmost infinite number\nof other letters that have been written\nby poets and authors and\nscientists and everyday people,\nis that it really encapsulates\nall three dimensions\nof attachment and grief.\nThese notions of space,\nwhere is something or somebody,\ntime, this dimension of,\nhow long would it take me to reach them\nor for them to reach me?\nWhat would it take, in terms\nof time, to be reunited?\nAnd then that last dimension of closeness,\nand the letter beautifully\nillustrates the fact\nthat, in grief, we maintain\nthat sense of closeness.\nAnd yet we have to uncouple it\nfrom these other two dimensions,\nas we're referring to, space and time.\nSo with this current\nunderstanding in mind,\na few things start to become obvious\nand entirely normal to us,\nin the best and most healthy\nsense of the word normal.\nFor instance, if you've\nlost somebody, or an animal,\nor even a thing that was\nvitally important to you,\nit should make perfect sense to you\nas to why you keep\nlooking for that person.\nI recall this in my own life.\nI had the unfortunate circumstance\nof my graduate advisor,\nwho I was very close with,\ndied quite young of breast cancer.\nAnd her daughter, she\nactually has two daughters,\nkept her cellphone and\nwould occasionally call me.\nI had a quite close\nrelationship to their family.\nAnd when it would come in,\nthe number would pop up on\nmy phone of not the daughter,\nbut the name that showed up\nwas of my graduate advisor.\nSo for years after she\ndied, my initial impulse,\nwhen the phone would ring was,\n\"Oh my goodness, she's calling.\"\nIt was a reflexive excitement\nbecause I truly always\nenjoyed hearing from her.\nShe was a wonderful,\nincredibly wonderful person, I should say.\nSimilarly, when somebody passes away,\nwe will find ourselves looking into a room\nexpecting to see them there,\nor expecting them to knock\non the door any moment,\nor to call on Sunday morning, as it were.\nThose expectations, those predictions\nthat the brain is making,\nare entirely normal,\nbecause they are based\non that deep catalog\nof episodic memory that you\nmaintain about that person.\nAgain, the depth and\nrichness of that catalog\nscaling, of course, in direct relation\nto how close you were\nwith that person, right?\nCloser to somebody means\nmore information about them.\nMore information about them\nmeans your brain has a lot of implicit,\nunconscious notions of when\nand where and how they show up.\nSo the fact that your brain,\nand indeed, sometimes your body reacts\nto the expectation that they'll\nbe there is entirely normal.\nIt's simply an activation of this map\nthat involves closeness, space, and time.\nNot surprisingly, then,\nthe reordering of that map\nthat's required in order to move through\nthe grieving process,\nis going to involve some remapping.\nAnd you, as the person grieving,\nhave the opportunity to ask\nwhich node as it's called,\nwhich element or\ndimension within that map,\nare you going to focus on?\nSome people really try\nhard to disengage with\nand remap their sense of\nemotional closeness to the person.\nThat is, it's so unbelievably\noverwhelming to them,\nthat the person is no longer accessible,\nthat they try and change their ideas\nabout how close they really were.\nThey try and change their\nemotional attachment to the person\nafter they've died.\nClearly in the example that\nI gave in the Feynman letter,\nthat's not the case.\nThe attachment seems indeed quite fixed\nand not going anywhere.\nPsychologists and\nneuroscientists generally agree\nthat the best way to\napproach moving through grief\nis actually to remap these dimensions\nwhile maintaining the\nclose sense of attachment\nto the person,\nby not in any way trying to undermine\nthe intensity of the attachment\nor how important it was to you.\nSo we'll now talk about\nhow that process works,\nand the different entry\npoints, as they're called,\nto engaging in that process.\nSo one straightforward way to think about\nthis state of mind and\nbody that we call grief,\nis that the idea that someone,\nor an animal, or a thing,\nsimply does not exist anymore\nis not something that the\nbrain can easily conceptualize.\nAnd the reason for that is that we,\nas beings that have a brain,\nand a brain, as an organ\nthat makes predictions,\ntends to rely more on\nexperience than knowledge.\nIn other words, the\nknowledge that someone,\nor an animal or a thing, is\ngone, that it doesn't exist,\nat least not in the dimensionality\nthat we were accustomed\nto relating to them in,\nis something that we can\nunderstand logically,\nbut that emotionally is very hard to undo,\nand from a memory perspective\nis very hard to undo.\nSo it's not just that we are in a state\nof emotional disbelief.\nIt's that we have neurons,\nliterally nerve cells\nand neural circuits,\nconnections between nerve cells,\nthat are dedicated to this\nvast, implicit knowledge\nof all the things we know\nabout that person, animal, or thing.\nAnd just because they are no\nlonger in the dimensionality,\nmeaning in the configuration,\nalive or present in our\nlife that they were before,\ndoesn't eliminate those memories.\nThose memories persist.\nAnd so anytime we call to\nmind the person's name,\nor we call to mind things\nthat remind us of them,\nor we suddenly feel the\ndesire to engage with them,\nthe memories, those\nepisodic implicit memories,\nas they're called,\nall that menu and library of knowledge,\nslams us straight in the face,\nand pushes us into a mode\nof wanting to act in a way\nthat's consistent with\nthem still being here\nin the way that all that knowledge\ntold us they were when we acquired it.\nThat's a very long-winded way of saying\nthat there's nothing wrong\nabout the emotional state\nwhen we are in a state of grief,\nin fact, quite the opposite.\nBut there is something\nwrong about the memories,\nbecause the memories are based on\nour prior knowledge of them,\nand those memories actually do not apply\nto our current knowledge of them.\nAnd again, even though our\nbrain is a prediction machine\nand it's a very good\none, it's not perfect.\nIn fact, it's far from perfect.\nSo really, moving through grief\nis a process of understanding\nhow relationships are mapped in the brain,\nspace, time, and closeness,\nalso called attachment,\nunderstanding those three dimensions,\nunderstanding that they\nare closely linked,\nand then understanding\nthat simply the knowledge\nthat somebody or something or an animal\nisn't accessible to us,\ndoes not allow us to discard\nof all the knowledge that we have.\nAnd as a consequence,\nour brain is constantly\ngenerating expectations\nof how to access them,\neven if we know that's\ncompletely irrational.\nNow this should, I would hope,\nassist you in moving through grief.\nIt's not a tool of the sort of,\nlike a switch that you can flip\nand suddenly not feel grief,\nbut it does point to a\nspecific set of mechanisms\nor a specific set of\nsteps that you can engage\nin order to start to move\nthrough the grieving process\nin the most adaptive and effective way,\nand in a way that still holds in mind,\nyour close attachment to the person.\nSo let's talk about some of the tools\nfor adaptively moving through grief.\nThese are tools gleaned from\nthe research psychology,\nthe clinical psychology, and\nthe neuroscience literature.\nSo I've synthesized my understanding\nof those three literatures,\nto provide the tools that\nI'm about to describe.\nThe first one involves the acknowledgement\nand really the understanding\nthat you don't want to\ndisengage or dismantle\nyour real attachment to\nsomeone, an animal, or a thing.\nThat's a real thing,\nand there is actually no adaptive reason\nto try and persuade\nyourself or numb yourself,\nor somehow avoid the thinking\nof just how much they meant to you.\nWhat is important, however,\nis that you make some\neffort to shift your mindset\nand your understanding of that person,\nin a way that holds in\nmind that yes, indeed,\nthe attachment is very real,\nand in some cases is very, very intense,\nbut is now going to be uncoupled\nfrom the other two dimensions of the map,\nnamely space and time.\nSo again, just to make absolutely clear,\nthere's no reason to try\nand convince yourself\nthat you weren't actually\nthat close to this person\nor them to you.\nThere's no reason to try\nand reduce the intensity\nof that attachment.\nTo the contrary, you\nwant to anchor yourself\nto that attachment, but\nyou want to make sure\nthat your thoughts about the person,\nand your feelings about the person,\nare not oriented toward or in\nreference to, I should say,\nthat map, that deep catalog\nof memories that you had.\nNow, this is not simply\na fancy way of saying,\ndon't live in the past.\nThis is saying, you need to maintain\nyour sense of attachment,\nbut you need to start making\npredictions and understanding\nabout how you're going to\nengage with that attachment,\nhow you're going to feel those things,\nwithout the expectation\nthat things that once happened before\nare going to happen again.\nSo it's a complicated\nprocess, you can imagine,\nbut you really want to hold and\nregister two things at once.\nIt's sort of like spinning\ntwo plates at once,\nand therefore it's going\nto feel like effort.\nOne way to do this is to set aside\na dedicated period of time,\nof maybe five or 10, maybe\neven as much as 30 minutes,\nor depending on your\ncapacity, 30 to 45 minutes,\nin which you are going to feel deeply\ninto your closeness and your attachment\nto that person, animal, or thing.\nBut you are consciously going to try\nand prevent yourself from thinking about\na couple of categories of things.\nFirst of all, you want to\nactively try and disengage\nfrom any attempt to engage in\nwhat's called counterfactual\nthinking, the what ifs.\nWhat if I had called them a day earlier?\nWhat if they had taken\na different route home?\nWhat if I had taken a\ndifferent route home?\nThese counterfactual modes of thinking\nare an infinite landscape of possibility,\nand they are very closely tied to guilt.\nGuilt is an interesting emotion.\nWe should probably do an\nentire episode about guilt,\nbut guilt as defined by\npsychologists and neuroscientists\nis actually a way of assigning\nourselves more agency,\nmore capability of controlling\nreality than actually exists.\nAnd it's a very slippery slope.\nAnd I want to be clear.\nIt's not the case that guilt\nis never an appropriate response,\nbut in the context of grieving,\nguilt is very precarious,\nbecause in thinking \"I\ncould have done this,\"\nor \"if I had only done that,\"\nyou are essentially exploring\nan infinite landscape\nof things that you can never refute.\nYou will never know that\nhad you not gone down\na different path or they had not taken\na particular path in life,\nthat things would've turned out different,\nbut you can't know that it\nwould've worked as well,\nmeaning you actually don't know\nthat your what ifs are true,\nand you don't know that they're not true.\nAnd so as an infinite space,\nit's a very precarious one,\nand it will not allow you to uncouple\nthat intense emotional\nattachment that I'm telling you\nis actually vital to hold onto,\nfrom that catalog of episodic memory\nthat you've established.\nIn fact, it's going to\nstrengthen those bonds.\nSo in this dedicated five or 10 or 30,\nwhatever period of time you can\ntolerate and maintain focus,\nthe idea is to think about\nyour attachment in a rich way,\nand to perhaps even experience\nthat in your brain and body.\nI think if you're in a stage of grief,\nthat actually will be\nfairly reflexive to do,\nbut to try as much as possible\nto hold that grief in the present\nand to be connected to your\nimmediate physical environment.\nSo you want to orient yourself\nin current space and time,\nrather than focus on memories,\nor what you would've liked to see happen,\nor the wish that they were still there,\nwhile at the same time,\nthinking about the depth and\nrichness of that attachment.\nThis is a obviously a\ntightrope walk, so to speak.\nIt's an emotionally challenging,\nand sometimes even will be experienced\nas a physically challenging\ntool or experience,\nbut in our understanding of\nhow attachments and grief\nare represented in the brain,\nthis can be an immensely\nbeneficial practice,\nbecause it is the first step,\nand indeed, it represents\nmany of the steps\nin the voyage from the\ninitial shock of loss,\nto our ability to hold in mind somebody\nor an animal or a thing in\na way that still allows us\nto feel the depth and fullness\nof connection to them,\nwithout feeling the yearning,\nthat reaching for the glass of water\nthat unfortunately will never be resolved.\nKeep in mind that as you\nembark on this process,\nit is entirely normal\nfor your mind to flip\ninto various states of expectation\nthat they're suddenly going to be there.\nIn fact, because of the closeness\nof these three dimensions in the map,\nspace, time, and attachment,\nit's entirely normal that\nwhen you start to think about\nyour attachment to somebody,\nor an animal, or a thing,\nthat you almost start to experience them\nas present in that environment.\nI'll share with you a somewhat bizarre,\nor it sounds bizarre\nto articulate out loud,\nbut many of you perhaps\nwill resonate with this.\nFor years after my graduate advisor died,\nI would get an experience of someone\ntouching the back of my neck\nwhen I would think about her.\nAnd that was not an experience\nI ever had with her, right?\nIt was a professional relationship.\nI don't ever recall her touching me\non the back of my neck,\nor me touching the back of\nmy neck in her presence,\nat least not on any regular basis.\nSo it was very perplexing to me.\nAnd then I encountered this\nincredible literature on grief,\nwhich said the following.\n\"Grief in many ways is\nlike a phantom limb.\"\nFor those of you that aren't familiar,\nmany people who experience\namputation of a limb,\neither through surgery\nor accident or otherwise,\nwill feel in a very genuine way\nthat the limb is still present,\neven though when they look\nfor the limb, it's not there.\nSo they can feel pain in limbs.\nThey can feel the sensation of touch.\nThere's some famous experiments\nfrom the neurologists\nand my former colleague\nat University of California, San Diego,\nwho goes by his last name, Ramachandran.\nSome people just call him Rama.\nHe's an incredible scientist,\nand has done a lot of\nreally important work,\nin particular on phantom limb,\namong other things,\nand has done some beautiful experiments\nshowing that people who\nhave phantom limb pain\nor that are experiencing\ndifferent sensations\nin their phantom limb,\nthat can be very intrusive,\nmuch in the same way\nthat expecting someone\nto walk through the door,\nwho you happen to know is deceased,\ncan be very intrusive.\nRamachandran's done beautiful experiments,\nshowing that if you give people\nwhat's called a mirror box,\nthis is a box in which\nyou insert an intact limb,\nand there are some mirrors\nthat give you the visual impression\nthat the other limb is still present,\nand you move the intact limb\nand you get a mirror\nimage of the non-existent,\nbut nonetheless a visual image\nof the phantom limb moving,\nthat you can resolve some of the pain\nof a limb that feels otherwise cramped up.\nIn other words, the visual perception\ncan reverse some of\nthese phantom sensations.\nIn many ways, the phantom limb scenario,\nand what I described about a sensation\nof being touched on the back of the neck,\nor this feeling that we have\nwhen we engage in the thinking\nand the emotions of our\nattachment to someone,\nan animal, or a thing is very\nmuch like a phantom limb,\nonly it exists in the emotional space,\nand it exists because it is reactivation\nof these maps about\nspace, time, and person.\nAnd so if the process\nof moving through grief,\nadaptively in a healthy way,\ninvolves maintaining the attachment,\nbut uncoupling that attachment\nfrom the space and time\nrepresentation of that person,\nanimal, or thing that we had before,\nwell, then the question becomes,\nwhere should we place our\nexpectation of them, right?\nNow, that of course will\nvary from person to person.\nSome people with particular\nreligious beliefs\nwill indeed believe that\nthe soul of the person,\nthe molecules of the person\nhave been reordered and exist in some sort\nof either distributed domain, right?\nThat they are in everything,\nor they are in one location.\nI'm not here to speak to\nthat one way or the other.\nThere's no good experiment I know\neither to prove or disprove that,\nnor would I want to.\nIt's not the job of science, frankly.\nHowever, allowing\nourselves to place notions\nof where that person, animal, or thing is\nin their current new configuration,\nwhatever that might be,\nashes to ashes, dust to dust,\nor that the person's soul\ncomes out of their body.\nThese are all the different\nvariations that people hear.\nOr some people think,\n\"Well, it's just molecules\nand they disintegrate and are reordered,\nand come up as the plants and the trees.\"\nAgain, a near infinite\nnumber of possibilities,\nand it depends a lot on personal belief.\nIt is, however, essential\nthat no matter what you believe,\nthat you have some firm representation\nof where that person, animal, or thing is\nso that you can plug it into this map,\nthis three-dimensional map of\nspace, time, and attachment.\nThe process of moving through grief\ncan't simply be that we\nhold onto the attachment\nand we discard with any understanding\nof where they are in space and time.\nAnd actually, the letter\nthat Feynman wrote\nto his deceased wife Arline,\nagain, so beautifully\nand really poignantly illustrates the fact\nthat he doesn't really\nknow where to find her.\nOn the one hand, he really\nunderstands that she's gone.\nAnd on the other hand,\nhe understands that he\nstill very much expects her\nto be there, that he would\nlike to mail the letter.\nBut then of course, in this final,\nsomewhat humorous line,\nhe doesn't know where to\nsend the letter, he tells us.\nWhat's very clear, and\nI think is very healthy,\nis the fact that the\nemotional bond is still there,\nthat that is maintained.\nAnd so this tool, if you will,\nof dedicated blocks of time\nfor really spending some effort,\nand it is indeed effort\nto access the emotional connection\nwhile starting to uncouple the other nodes\nof the map, as it were,\nis something that is hard.\nYou should expect it to be hard,\nbut in terms of the options one has\nin order to deal with grief,\nit is indeed the most\nadaptive way to go about it.\nYou're not trying to\navoid thinking about it.\nYou're not engaging in this\ncounterfactual thinking,\nthe what if, what if, what if.\nYou're not drowning it out with substances\nor delusion or with other\nways of distracting yourself.\nSo in that sense, it is truly adaptive.\nNow, of course, I don't want to imply\nthat I'm a clinical psychologist.\nI'm certainly not.\nThere is absolutely a place\nfor working with a trained professional\nto move through grief,\nespecially these situations,\nthese one in 10 people\nwho deal with what's\ncalled complicated grief,\nor very prolonged grief.\nThose are somewhat different things,\nbut in general, point to the fact\nthat there are people who have\nan exceptionally hard\ntime moving through grief.\nWe'll talk about who those people are\nand ways to move through them,\nwith or without a\nprofessional to assist you.\nBut nonetheless, we're\nstarting to understand\non the basis of neuroscience,\nwhat some of the more adaptive\nand functional ways of\nmoving through grief are.\nIn order to really understand how a tool\nof the sort that we're describing to work,\nand what it's designed to\naccomplish at a mechanistic level,\nI'd like to teach you\nabout a very important\naspect of your brain function\nthat has everything to do with grief\nand the process of moving through grief,\nbut has a lot to do\nwith other aspects of our\nlife experience as well.\nSome of you are probably familiar\nwith a brain area called the hippocampus.\nThe hippocampus is a\nstructure that's involved\nin the formation of new memories,\nbut not the maintenance of memories.\nI discussed the hippocampus in detail\nin our episode on memory,\nand our episode with our guest,\nDr. Wendy Suzuki from New York University,\nan expert on learning and memory.\nDuring those two discussions,\nI did not however,\ntouch into what the\ndifferent cell types are\nin the hippocampus, and the\ndifferent roles they perform.\nAnd it turns out that there are indeed\ndifferent cell types in the hippocampus,\nand they perform very different roles\nthat are absolutely central\nto the grief process.\nWe have cells in our hippocampus,\nmeaning you have cells\nin your hippocampus.\nThese cells are neurons,\nnerve cells that fire any time,\nor, and when we say fire,\nI should just remind you,\nI mean, have electrical activity,\nany time that we enter a\nparticular familiar location.\nSo for instance, think about your bedroom,\nand think about where the bed is.\nAs you're doing that,\nthese so-called place cells are firing,\nnot necessarily to represent\nthat it's a bed at that location,\nbut to represent the location itself.\nWe also have neurons in our hippocampus\nand elsewhere in our brain, I should say,\nthat represent proximity.\nSo for instance, if you were to wake up\nin the middle of the night\nand walk into the kitchen,\nand it's somewhat dark,\nand you orient toward the sink\nto get yourself a glass of water,\nor to the refrigerator to get yourself\nsomething to drink or to eat,\nas you get close to the\nsink or the refrigerator,\nthere are neurons in your hippocampus\nthat are going to start\nengaging electrical activity,\nbecause you are in the\nmirror expected proximity\nof the sink or refrigerator,\nand you know where they are,\nhence the word expected.\nNow that all seems fine and good.\nYou've got neurons that\nrepresent where things are,\nand it sort of goes without saying\nthat those same neurons map\nto our emotional attachments.\nWe generally know where\nto find our loved ones.\nEven if they don't live with us,\nwe generally know what city they're in.\nEven if they're traveling,\nwe generally have a sense\nof where they're traveling\nor the general area in\nwhich they're traveling.\nPlace cells and proximity cells\nare involved in that kind of mapping\nand representations as well.\nNow there's a third kind of cell\nthat's particularly important\nfor the sort of tool\nthat we were talking about earlier,\nthat tool of holding on\nto the emotional attachment to somebody,\nand yet trying to deliberately\nremap our understanding\nof where they are in space and time.\nAnd that has to do with\na category of cells\ncalled trace cells.\nTrace cells were discovered\nby a number of laboratories.\nI think the most renowned of\nthose is the Moser Laboratory.\nThe Mosers are a couple.\nActually, they were a couple.\nThey're now, I think, amicably\nseparated or divorced.\nThat's not what this episode's about.\nIf I have that wrong, forgive me.\nEdvard and Britt are their names.\nTheir relationship isn't what's important,\nexcept what is important\nis the work that they did\ntogether in one form or another,\nwhich was very important work,\nestablishing this category of cells\nnot just in the hippocampus,\nbut in an area of the brain\ncalled the entorhinal cortex,\nthat acts as a sort of coordinate system,\nto orient us in space and time.\nTrace cells are activated\nwhen we expect something\nto be at a given location,\nbut it's not there.\nExperiments done in their laboratory\nand in other laboratories\nhave shown that, for instance,\nif you give a rodent or frankly, a person,\na object that always resides\nat the same location,\nand we reach to it in order to access it,\nlet's say where your\ncoffeemaker is in the morning.\nI do a pour-over coffee.\nIf I'm drinking coffee or\nlatte, I'll do a pour-over.\nIt's always more or less\nin the same location.\nAnd so there are place\ncells and proximity cells\nthat relate to my being able to find\nthat pour-over coffee cone thing.\nHowever, if I were to go to that location\nand it wasn't there, the trace cells,\nthese neurons in my hippocampus\nand in the entorhinal\ncortex and elsewhere,\n'cause again, these cells are connected\nby way of circuitry,\nby way of connections,\nthose trace cells would fire.\nWe could even call it a trace circuit.\nIt's a circuit that has an expectation\nthat something will be in a location.\nBut when something is\nnot at that location,\nthis circuit becomes active.\nThis is important because\nwhat we're talking about here\nis a neural circuit and a set of neurons\nthat are responsible, not for\nthe presence of something,\nbut the absence of something.\nWe have every reason to believe,\nbased on neuroimaging studies\nand studies in animal models,\nthat trace cells become very\nactive in the immediate stage\nafter the loss of a loved one,\nthat the brain and our\nmaps of the person, place,\nor thing that we know cognitively,\nwe understand, we even\nbelieve they are gone.\nThey are not accessible\nfor whatever reason,\ndeath or otherwise.\nAnd yet we have neurons that are firing,\nto reveal that absence to us.\nAnd these neurons are closely associated\nwith neurons that tell us\nwhere things ought to be.\nSo if you feel the expectation,\nor you sense that somebody\nshould walk through the door any moment,\nor call at any moment,\nor be next to you when you wake up,\nand yet you cognitively\nunderstand that they won't,\nthat there's no real\nreason why they should,\nbecause they are indeed\ngone, you are not crazy.\nIn fact, it's simply a reflection\nof the normal functioning\nof these trace cells\nand trace circuits.\nNow I'd like to consider why two people,\nboth who are intensely attached\nto a person that is no longer there,\ncan experience the grief\nof the loss of that person\nin such different ways.\nThis is often observed.\nYou can have, God forbid,\nincredibly sadly, in cases\nwhere a child is lost,\nwhere both parents are grieving intensely,\nbut one seems to feel it at\na emotional depth and level\nthat seems distinct from the other.\nNow of course, keep in mind\nthat we never really know\nhow other people are feeling.\nThis is something actually that was raised\nin the episode where I\ninterviewed a psychiatrist\nand researcher colleague of mine\nfrom Stanford, Karl Deisseroth.\nAs a psychiatrist, I heard him say once\nthat we really don't know\nhow other people feel.\nIn fact, a lot of times\nwe don't even really know\nhow we feel, or at least describing that\nis quite challenging with language, often.\nAnd indeed that is the case.\nWe don't really know\nhow other people feel.\nThere's no clear way of knowing\nthat the expression someone else has\nor whether or not they're crying or not,\nor their body language really represents\nhow they feel inside.\nSo that is important to keep in mind.\nNonetheless, there does seem to be\na sort of a split among people,\nand indeed, among animals as well,\neven within a species,\nin terms of how intensely they feel\nthe yearning aspect of grief.\nAnd it appears, based on a number\nof different lines of evidence,\nthat that relates to this molecule\nthat some of you have probably\nheard of, which is oxytocin.\nOxytocin is a hormone slash peptide.\nA peptide just means a protein,\ngenerally a small protein,\nand a hormone is generally something\nthat functions at numerous\nlocations in the body\nto impact numerous organs\nand areas of the brain.\nSo a peptide can be a hormone,\nand a hormone can be a peptide.\nThey are not mutually exclusive.\nOxytocin has a variety of\nroles in the brain and body.\nIt's involved in milk\nletdown during lactation.\nIt's involved in pair bonding,\nboth in males and females.\nIt's involved in bonding\nof parent to child,\nand indeed, between romantic\npartners, et cetera, et cetera.\nLet's talk about some of the animal models\nthat inform us about the\npotential roles of oxytocin\nin the grieving process.\nThere's a species of animal\ncalled the prairie vole,\nand believe it or not,\nthe prairie vole has been\nstudied fairly extensively\nby neuroscience and\npsychology researchers.\nIn fact, our former director\nof the National Institutes\nof Mental Health, Tom Insel,\nhis laboratory focused quite\nheavily on prairie voles.\nPrairie voles are one species of animal,\nbut depending on where they live,\nyou find that some prairie\nvoles are monogamous.\nThat is, they mate with the\nsame prairie vole for life.\nThey raise litters of little\nprairie voles for life,\nand other prairie voles,\ngenerally that live in\ndifferent locations in the wild,\nare non-monogamous,\nsometimes called polygamous.\nThe neurochemical and circuit basis\nfor this monogamy versus\nnon-monogamy, quite interesting.\nHowever, in the context\nof grief and attachment,\nthe prairie voles have taught us a lot,\nand they've taught us a lot\nthrough the following experiment.\nYou take two prairie\nvoles that are coupled up.\nSo these would be\nmonogamous prairie voles,\nthat have established a couple bond.\nI guess you would call\nthat at a prairie voledom.\nAnyway, you put them in a cage together.\nThey mate together, they\nraise young together,\nand then you separate them.\nYou literally put a physical barrier\nbetween the two of them,\nand you can evaluate how strongly\none prairie vole will work\nto get access to the\nother prairie vole, right?\nThis is sort of the \"Romeo and Juliet\"\nof prairie vole experiments.\nAnd what you observe is that\nthe monogamous prairie voles\nwill work very hard to\nget back to their mate,\nto get access to their mate.\nThey will lever press.\nThey'll even walk across a metal plate\nthat they get a electrical shock.\nThey'll work very, very hard.\nThey will cross rivers\nand valleys, if you will,\nin the experimental context, that is.\nThe polygamous prairie voles,\nand again, we don't know\nif they are polyamorous.\nWe don't know what they feel, right?\nWe don't know if they're in love\nor if they're motivated\nsimply for other things.\nBut the non-monogamous prairie\nvoles will not work as hard\nto access a prairie vole partner.\nNow you could argue\nthat's because they expect\nthat there will be other\nprairie vole partners,\nbut even if they've never experienced\nanother prairie vole partner,\nthey won't work quite as hard to get back\nin connection with this\nother prairie vole,\nto mate or otherwise.\nThis turns out to be interesting,\nwhen you start to explore the patterns\nof so-called oxytocin\nreceptors in the brain.\nTo make a long story short,\nand to also bridge to\nthe human literature,\nit turns out that the\nmonogamous prairie voles\nhave far more oxytocin\nreceptors in this brain area\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nthe nucleus accumbens.\nAnd again, to remind you,\nthe nucleus accumbens\nis the brain area\nassociated with motivation,\ncraving and pursuit.\nSo it's as if the monogamous prairie voles\nhave a capacity to link\nthe attachment circuitry\nand the molecules of attachment,\nin this case, oxytocin,\nto reward pathways and\nto motivational pathways.\nPolygamous, or we should say,\nnon-monogamous prairie voles, do as well.\nHowever, they have less\noxytocin receptors.\nSo in other words,\nnon-monogamous prairie voles\nseem to have less yearning\nfor attachment overall,\nat least to a single\nindividual prairie vole.\nAnd when we look at the human literature,\nin terms of oxytocin receptor expression\nand brain imaging experiments, and so on,\nwhat you find is the same,\nthat people that experience intense grief,\nand a deep yearning and a motivation\nto reconnect with the person, animal,\nor thing that is lost,\nin many cases have heightened levels\nof oxytocin specifically,\nor I should say, oxytocin\nreceptors to be exact,\nspecifically within the brain regions\nassociated with craving and pursuit.\nSo for those of you that find yourself\nin this kind of stuck mode,\nthis persistence of trying\nto reach into the past\nor wishful thinking,\nthis counterfactual thinking,\n\"if only, if only, if only.\"\nYou don't necessarily want\nto pathologize that thinking.\nFirst of all, we should acknowledge\nthat it's not necessarily adaptive.\nAnd in fact, in the\ncomplete loss of somebody,\nor if somebody says\nthey don't want anything\nto do with you ever again,\nby all means, you know, if\nthat's expressed clearly,\nthen you need to accept that reality.\nBut the yearning, the\ndesire, and the impulsivity,\nthat kind of leaning in\nat a almost reflexive way,\nto try and access that person again,\nto text them, to want to\nhear from them, could,\nand I have to highlight,\ncould reflect the fact\nthat you just so happen to\nhave more oxytocin receptors\nor maybe more oxytocin\noverall in this brain area\nthat's associated with\nmotivation and pursuit.\nIt does not necessarily mean\nthat you are more capable of attachment\nthan people who move\nthrough grief more quickly.\nAnd I should say that\npeople move through grief\nat different rates.\nEven if two people lost the\nsame person, or same animal,\npeople move through\nthis at different rates.\nAnd some of that is no\ndoubt psychological,\nbut some of it, no doubt,\nis also neurochemical and biological.\nAnd in sharing this with you,\nI hope it sheds some understanding\nand perhaps even some\ncompassion for people\nwho are moving through things more quickly\nor in a different way.\nAnd of course it should\nalso, I would hope,\nshed compassion and understanding\nfor people that seem incapable\nof quote unquote moving on.\nIt's taking them far longer to move on.\nEarlier, we talked\nabout complicated grief,\nnon-complicated grief, and\nprolonged grief disorder.\nAnd I should say that\nthe precise divisions\nbetween these categories\nis not very precise.\nIt takes a really trained expert\nto be able to identify whether or not\nsomebody is in the prolonged\ngrief disorder category,\ncomplicated or non-complicated grief.\nThere's actually a set of questionnaires\nthat I invite you to answer if you like.\nThey were provided, or I\nshould say I accessed them\nthrough a public site on\nMary-Frances O'Connor's webpage.\nWe'll put them in the show note captions.\nYou actually can submit those\nanswers in an anonymous way\nto a study that she's doing.\nShe has several surveys,\none for loss of a romantic relationship,\nother for loss due to death of somebody,\nand still another one that\nrelates to homesickness,\nand it's also available in\nseveral different languages.\nSo I'll provide a link to that website.\nIt's very easy to download.\nThere's no cost to that at all.\nYou can contribute to the scientific\ndata collection process, if you like.\nAnd I do believe that\nyou get your scores back\nor an interpretation of your\nscores by participating there.\nWhen Mary-Frances O'Connor\nhopefully comes on the podcast,\nshe can tell us some more of the detail\nabout separating out this\nprolonged grief disorder,\ncomplicated and non-complicated grief.\nBut in the meantime, it's very clear\nthat people move through\ngrief at different rates.\nAnd as I mentioned just a moment ago,\nthat this is entirely normal,\nprobably has a basis in neurochemicals\nand hormones, such as oxytocin.\nThere are probably other reasons as well.\nIn fact, we can assume\nwith almost certainty\nthat there are other reasons as well.\nNonetheless, I think\nit is really important\nto think about why some people\nmight have a harder time\nmoving through grief due\nto life circumstance,\ninnate differences, and so on.\nThere's a very nice set of studies,\nbut one in particular,\nentitled \"Catecholamine Predictors\nof Complicated Grief Outcomes.\"\nHere again, the first author\nis Mary-Frances O'Connor,\nreminding us that she's done\nso much important work in this area.\nThis paper has several conclusions,\nbut one of the key conclusions\nis that this particular\ncategory of molecules\nwe call the catecholamines,\nthe catecholamines include epinephrine,\nwhich is also adrenaline,\nnorepinephrine, which is noradrenaline,\nand dopamine, which you've\nlearned about before.\nHere, I'm just going to paraphrase,\nor I'll read directly, actually.\nWhat they found was that \"participants\",\nagain, this is human subjects,\n\"with the highest levels of epinephrine,\nof adrenaline, pre-treatment,\nhad the highest levels\nof complicated grief\nsymptoms post-treatment,\nand that could account\nfor their baseline level of symptoms.\"\nWhat this means is that people\nthat have a lot of circulating adrenaline,\nwe might even call these people,\npeople who are, or typically reside\nat a higher level of\nautonomic arousal, right?\nWe have an autonomic nervous system\nthat dictates how calm\nor alert or stressed\nwe happen to be just at baseline.\nPeople who tend to be more\nalert and anxious at baseline,\nprior to any grief episode,\ntend to have, or statistically on average,\nwe should say, are more\nlikely to experience\ncomplicated grief and maybe\neven prolonged grief symptoms.\nSo if you're somebody that is\nanticipating losing someone,\nor an animal, or a thing at some point,\nand I think that really means everybody,\nutilizing tools to\nadjust your epinephrine,\nyour adrenaline levels down\nhas a number of important benefits,\nimproving sleep, health\nmetrics, et cetera.\nThere are tools to do that.\nWe have an episode on mastering stress\nthat you can find at our\nwebsite, hubermanlab.com.\nIt has a lot of behavioral tools\nthat are backed by science,\nsome of work that was\ndone in my laboratory,\nbut certainly other laboratories as well,\nthat will allow you to control\nyour autonomic nervous\nsystem, both in real time,\nand reduce the overall level of stress\nand even chronic activation\nof the so-called sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nwhich is just fancy geek speak for saying,\nthere are tools to help you be calm,\nnot just for sake of\nnavigating daily stress,\nbut as this paper illustrates,\nfor anticipating the\nfact that at some point,\nyou will lose somebody,\nan animal, or a thing,\nand there is a way to\nmove through that process\nthat we call healthy, normal grieving.\nAnd then there's the\nso-called complicated grief,\nor prolonged grief disorders,\nthat reflect immense challenge\nin moving through grief\nat a reasonable rate.\nSo you can somewhat inoculate yourself\nagainst complicated or prolonged grief,\nby reducing your resting levels of,\nor your pre-loss levels of\nepinephrine, of adrenaline.\nAnd again, there are\nexcellent tools to do that.\nI won't review them here for sake of time,\nbut they're time-stamped,\nand you can access those easily.\nAgain, zero cost tools.\nGoing back to this paper,\n\"Catecholamine Predictors of Complicated\nGrief Treatment Outcomes,\"\nshould say that not only did participants\nwith the highest levels of adrenaline\nhave the highest levels\nof complicated grief\nsymptoms post-treatment,\nbut the predictive relationship\nbetween these two things,\nadrenaline and complicated grief,\nwas not seen in depression.\nAnd I find that incredibly interesting,\nbecause it further separates\ndepression from grieving\nand grieving from depression.\nIt's a resounding theme again and again.\nGrieving is not depression,\nand depression is not\nnecessarily grieving.\nThey can coexist, but they\nare separable as well,\nand indeed, reflect separate\nbrain circuitries entirely.\nSo the conclusion they draw is that\n\"The present study supports the hypothesis\nthat catecholamine levels,\"\nagain, epinephrine,\ndopamine, norepinephrine\nare the catecholamines,\n\"are affected by bereavement and in turn,\ncan affect the ability of\nthose with complicated grief\nto benefit from psychotherapy.\"\nSo what does all this mean?\nWhat this means is, we\ncan prepare ourselves\nto be in a better state to access, yes,\naccess grief when it's appropriate.\nAnd indeed, grief is the\nappropriate response,\nwhen we lose someone,\nan animal, or a thing\nthat we are closely attached to,\nand yet, to be able to move through that\nat a pace and in a way that\nis most adaptive for us.\nAnd to just, again, highlight\nwhat adaptive means.\nIt does not mean dissociating\nfrom the attachment\nto the person, animal, or thing.\nI just want to pause for a second,\nand mention why I keep repeating\nperson, animal, or thing.\nI'm saying that because,\nwhile grieving the loss of a person,\nor a relationship with a person,\ndoesn't have to be\nthrough death, of course,\nbut death or otherwise\nis something that we all\ncan intuitively understand,\neven if we haven't experienced it.\nWe are capable of\nachieving great attachments\nto animals as well.\nAnd while the loss of\na thing, of an object,\nin no way, shape or form,\napproximates the loss of\na person or an animal,\nI would never suggest that it does,\nit would also be naive and\nunfair of me or anyone else\nto suggest that things can't\nhold immense importance to us,\nand that the loss of them\ncan feel quite significant,\nand invoke the grieving process.\nThis isn't always about materialism.\nSometimes it's purely about\nthe sentimental attachment.\nSo for instance, the\nloss of a wedding ring\nor an engagement ring that\nwas very meaningful to you,\nor an article of clothing or a painting,\nor even a small, seemingly\nunimportant object\nto somebody else,\nbut something that held\ngreat meaning to you,\nmaybe a seashell that you collected\nwith somebody on the beach,\nand then somehow it gets lost.\nAnd it's the relationship with that person\nthat's contained within\nthat object for you,\nas a representation within\nthat object that's important.\nThat's the reason why I keep saying,\nperson, animal, or thing.\nI think it's only fair to\ninclude things in that category,\nbut of course, with the understanding\nthat they don't hold the\nabsolute same magnitude\nas the loss of a being.\nOne thing that we ought\nto consider for a moment,\nis whether or not the depth of attachment\nthat you have to somebody\npredicts how long it will take\nfor you to move through\nthe loss of that person.\nWe often hear this.\nActually, I can remember some years ago,\nat the end of a relationship,\na friend and colleague of mine saying,\n\"You know, for every year\nthat you were together,\nit's going to take you one\nmonth to get over that person.\"\nAnd I thought, \"Where in the world\ndid those data come from?\" [laughs]\nAnd this is what I call\nanecdata or collective data,\nwhere this is like phrases such as,\n\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder.\"\nAnd indeed, sometimes absence\ncan make the heart grow fonder,\nin the context of two living people\nor people in a loving relationship,\nor even in the context of grief and loss.\nBut of course, there's,\n\"Absence makes the heart grow fonder,\"\nand then you also will hear,\n\"Out of sight, out of mind.\"\nAnd if you've been\nlistening to this episode,\nclearly, out of sight\ndoes not mean out of mind\nor out of emotional connection.\nSo these sayings of, \"Well,\nit takes X number of months\nfor number of years,\"\nor \"out of sight, out of mind,\"\nor \"absence makes the heart grow fonder,\"\nthey really don't hold a lot of meaning,\nat least not for somebody like me,\nwho likes science because\nscience is at least geared\ntoward or aims towards establishing things\nin fact, not opinion,\nbut also because science\nallows you to make predictions.\nIt allows you to orient\nyourself in a process,\nand make predictions and understand.\nSo, what are we to think of people\nwho seem very, very attached to somebody?\nThey break up, and they seem\njust crushed, devastated.\nBut three weeks later,\nthey're in a new relationship\nand they seem perfectly fine.\nOr somebody whose spouse dies,\nand then suddenly they're\nin a new relationship.\nI think there are rates of\ntransition, if you will,\nthat suggest some dysfunction,\npathology, et cetera.\nBut here we aren't in a position to judge.\nWe're only in a position\nto speculate about this.\nAnd I think we can reasonably speculate\nthat it sort of makes sense\nwhy someone who has an\nintense attachment to somebody\nmight be able to form\nintense attachments generally, right,\nthat they aren't restricted to one person,\nwhereas other people who have\nan intense attachment to somebody\nmight find themselves entirely\nincapable of moving on,\nor it would take them a very long time,\nhence the lines in the Feynman\nletter to Arline about,\nhe had met various other young women.\nThey seemed perfectly nice.\nAnd yet, they were meaningless to him\nin the shadow of her memory,\nor we should say, in the\nlight of Arline's memory,\nor the memory of Arline, rather.\nSo these dimensionalities of attachment,\nthey cut in every direction.\nAnd I don't think any\nwell-trained psychologist\nor neuroscientist would ever say,\n\"Oh, if you are somebody\nwho becomes very attached,\ntherefore it's very hard to move on.\"\nI think that could be true.\nIt could also be that if you're somebody\nwho has a great capacity for attachment,\nyou have a great capacity\nfor attachment overall.\nNeuroscience nor psychology\nis really in a position\nto judge, certainly,\nbut it's also not in a position\nto make those kinds of predictions,\nat least the field, as\nit stands right now,\nof attachment and grieving,\ncan't really speak to why that's the case.\nSo that's my attempt to depathologize\nsome of what we observe,\nalthough I have to confess,\nfrom a just sort of everyday stance,\nthat sometimes the rate in which\npeople move out of\nattachments and grieving\ncan be somewhat eerie.\nI'd like to take a moment\nand explore this idea\nthat allowing ourselves to really feel\nthe attachment to somebody\ncan accelerate or at least support\nadaptive transitioning through grief.\nThere's a really wonderful\nstudy that, on the face of it,\nappears to be a, what\nwe call negative result.\nA negative result is when\na hypothesis is posed,\nand then turns out the\nhypothesis is not true.\nBut as is the case with so many\ninteresting scientific findings,\noften when there's a negative result,\nthere's a more interesting result\nnested in that negative outcome.\nAnd this is the case in a particular paper\nI'll share with you now.\nThis is a paper published\nin the journal \"Biological Psychology.\"\nAnd again, the title is posed\nas a question, which is,\n\"Emotional Disclosure for Whom?\nA Study of Vagal Tone in Bereavement.\"\nWhat this study explored\nwas whether or not written disclosure\nof the emotional connection\nto somebody that was lost\nwould be effective as a way for people\nto move through the grieving process.\nThe study also explored\nthe so-called vagus nerve.\nThe vagus nerve is an\nextensive nerve pathway\nthat is bidirectional\nbetween brain and body,\nso brain to body and body to brain.\nIt generally is associated\nwith calming effects\non our brain and body,\nalthough that's certainly\nnot always the case.\nThe way to think about it in terms of\nwhat we're going to talk about now\nis heart rate and heart rate variability.\nAnd in very simplistic terms,\nif your heart was just allowed to beat\nat its sort of default rate,\nthat rate would be rather high,\nbecause of the activation of\nthe so-called sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nthe alertness component of\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system,\nas it's called, involves calming.\nWe sometimes hear\nsympathetic is for stress\nor fight or flight.\nIt's for a lot of other things\nas well, I should mention,\nand it is not for sympathy.\nSympa simply means together,\nand it reflects the activity\nof a bunch of neurons\nbeing active at the same\ntime or together, sympa,\nwhereas parasympathetic\nis often associated\nwith quote unquote rest\nand digest functions,\nor calming functions,\nalthough it is certainly\ninvolved in other things as well.\nSo sympathetic nervous\nsystem drives alertness,\npanic, stress, et cetera.\nParasympathetic nervous system,\nmeaning a distinct set\nof neurons drive calming,\nfalling asleep, digestion,\nsexual arousal for that matter, and so on.\nSo it's sort of like a seesaw\nof alertness and calm, alertness and calm,\nsympathetic and\nparasympathetic, back and forth.\nThe vagus nerve is generally associated\nwith parasympathetic functions,\nand has the capacity to\nslow down our heart rate,\nin particular, by exhales,\nand just simply because of\nthe movement of the diaphragm\nand its relationship to the heart\nand the thoracic cavity.\nExhales result in slowing\ndown of the heart rate.\nThis is what we call an\nincreased vagal tone.\nSo let me explain for a moment.\nAnd actually here's a tool you can use,\nnot just in terms of navigating grief,\nbut in terms of stress\nmodulation, generally.\nWe have a muscle called the diaphragm.\nWhen we inhale, [inhales]\nwhether or not it's through\nour mouth or our nose,\nour diaphragm moves down.\nAs a consequence, there\nis more space overall\nin the thoracic cavity.\nThe heart gets a little bit bigger,\nbelieve it or not, volume-wise,\nblood flows more slowly\nthrough that large volume.\nAnd there's a signal conveyed\nfrom the nervous system to the\nheart to speed the heart up.\nSo inhales literally speed your heart up.\nAnd when you exhale,\nthe diaphragm moves up.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthere's less space in the thoracic cavity.\nHeart gets a little bit smaller.\nThe existing blood volume\nin the heart at that time\nmoves more quickly through\nthat small volume, right?\nGiven amount of blood volume,\nmake the compartment it's\nin, the heart, smaller,\nand the blood moves more\nquickly through that volume.\nAnd as a consequence, the nervous system\nsends a signal to the heart,\nvia the vagus and other pathways,\nto slow the heart down.\nIn other words, exhales\nslow the heart down.\nThat process, that relationship\nbetween inhales speeding the heart up,\nand exhales slowing the heart down,\nis something called\nrespiratory sinus arrhythmia.\nSome people are able to engage\nrespiratory sinus arrhythmia\nmore naturally, more\nreflexively than others.\nYou can actually train this\nby consciously thinking\nabout slowing your heart rate\nwhile you exhale,\nand consciously thinking about\nincreasing your heart rate\nas you inhale.\nYou can literally\nstrengthen these pathways.\nNow, respiratory sinus arrhythmia,\nand the ability to slow your\nheart rate with exhales,\nis one dimension of\nwhat's called vagal tone,\nor your ability to control\nyour overall level of activation\nof alertness and stress,\nwith these vagus nerve pathways.\nSo vagal tone is something\nthat varies from person to person.\nIf you've trained up\nor you've thought about\nyour relationship between\nbreath and heart rate,\nyou can improve vagal tone.\nSome people have very robust vagal tone\nwithout having done any training.\nOther people have less of it, et cetera.\nI'll just paraphrase from this paper,\nand you'll see where this takes us\nin terms of navigating grief,\nbecause it's quite important.\n\"The vagus nerve provides\ninhibitory regulatory\ninfluence on the heart,\nallowing the heart rate\nto increase rapidly\nthrough vagal withdrawal,\"\nthat means kind of coming off the break\nof the parasympathetic nervous system,\n\"as in response to a stressor\nin one's environment.\"\nRight, when you're stressed,\nyou rarely take the opportunity,\nif it's an immediate stress\nor threat, to actively exhale,\nalthough that would be\na great tool to use.\nAnd in fact, we promote that tool\nin our \"Mastering Stress\" episode.\n\"Vagal withdrawal usually co-occurs\nwith an increase in sympathetic\nactivation of the heart.\"\nYou now know what that is,\n\"or is known as the\nfight or flight response.\nVagal tone reflects the degree\nto which there is tonic,\"\nmeaning ongoing, \"vagal\ninfluence on the heart.\"\nSo when you have a high\ndegree of vagal tone,\nit means that you are\nalways activating that break\non your stress system, just at default.\nAnd some people just\nhappen to do that more.\nOther people need to practice\nlong exhale breathing\nin order to build up vagal tone,\nsomething that's very useful to do,\nwhether you're grieving or not.\nNow in this study, what they did\nis they had people,\nand I should say it was 35 participants,\ngo through a writing exercise\nfor a period of weeks.\nThey actually wrote about\nthree times per week.\nThen there was a follow\nup at some period of time,\nand then again, about a month later.\nAnd there were two different groups.\nOne group was in the so-called\nwritten disclosure group.\nWhat they did is they, on day one,\nthey would write about what\nhappened when a loved one died.\nAnd indeed they used people\nwho had experienced real loss.\nAnd so they were asked to talk about\nand write about their deepest emotions\nand thoughts about it,\nmemories of their loved one,\nvery intense stuff, if you think about it,\nif they're in the immediate\nperiod of having lost someone.\nThen they actually were\nasked to write a letter\nto the person that they lost.\nSo again, a very intense\nexercise to go through,\nif you did indeed lose\nsomebody as these subjects had.\nAnd then of course there was the testing,\nsome period of time later,\nand I'll tell you what that period,\nwhat that testing involved.\nThe other group was a\nso-called control group,\nwhere they were simply told to write\nabout how they use their time.\nSo an emotionally kind of\nempty writing exercise,\nif you will.\nThey described what they did\ntoday after they woke up,\net cetera, no heavy\nemotional content, and so on.\nNow, as I mentioned earlier,\nthe immediate results of this\nstudy were a negative result,\nmeaning no effect.\nThe disclosure that, we should say,\nthe emotionally intense writing group\nand the control group did\nnot differ at baseline\non any symptom measures\nor psychological variables, they tell us,\nand at least at face value,\nsomewhat disappointingly,\nthere really wasn't any kind\nof difference in outcome\nbetween the group that wrote about\nthe very emotionally intense stuff\nversus non-emotionally intense.\nNow, what I didn't tell you thus far\nis why they had them do\nthis exercise at all.\nThey had them do this exercise\nbecause many of the effective practices\nfor moving through grief\ninvolve, as I mentioned earlier,\ngetting close to and actually\ndeliberately experiencing\nthe attachment that one has\nto that person that was lost,\nnot distracting one's self,\nnot getting into this\ncounterfactual thinking,\nthe what if, what if, what if,\nbut rather thinking about,\nor in this case, writing\nabout the real attachment.\nAnd so the initial idea was,\nif people write about this attachment,\nthat they're going to\nexperience this attachment,\nand that will serve them\nin some or many ways,\nin terms of moving through grief.\nAnd that wasn't what they found.\nThey found no difference\nbetween the two groups,\nuntil they explored who\nhad higher vagal tone,\nwho had a greater degree\nof so-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.\nIn other words, who was able\nto modulate their state,\nusing their breathing and their body.\nAnd what they discovered was\nthat a subset of individuals\nwho had a high degree of vagal tone\nseemed to get more benefit from\nthis writing-type exercise.\nNow, this is one study,\nand I would consider it fairly\npreliminary with 35 subjects.\nAlthough, you know,\nit's a study unto itself\nand I think a quite nice one,\nand it really set the stage\nfor a number of other\nstudies that followed,\nfrom this group and other groups,\nthat really point to the\nfact that yes, indeed,\naccessing these states of emotionality\nby writing or thinking about somebody\nis quite powerful in terms\nof engaging the bodily states\nand the mind states associated\nwith the attachment.\nAnd that is very beneficial\nfor moving through grief.\nThat is very beneficial\nfor sensing the attachment.\nAnd now it makes perfect\nsense as to why some people\nwould benefit from that sort\nof practice more than others,\nbecause some people are able to access\nmore real somatic feelings of attachment\nby writing about the attachment,\nor by thinking about it, than others.\nSo this brings us back\nto an earlier discussion\nwe were having, where\nwe were talking about\nhow some people seem to move\nthrough things very quickly,\nor don't seem to be grieving constantly,\nand a spouse or a family member\nof that person might think,\n\"Gosh, why aren't you upset?\nHow is it that you can be\nfunctional and I'm not,\"\nor, \"how is it that\nyou can be functional?\"\nThere can even be fractures\nin families and relationships\non the basis of differences in\nrates of grieving and so on.\nWell, some of this, again,\nprobably relates to psychology\nand the different attachments\nthat people had to the person or animal\nor thing that was lost,\nbut it no doubt also has to do\nwith how much of a mind/body connection,\nhow much vagal tone exists in the person,\nwhen they suddenly found\nthemselves in the grief episode.\nSo this actually offers\nmultiple opportunities.\nIf you're somebody, for instance,\nwho is grieving so intensely and so often\nthat you're finding it immensely difficult\nto move through grief\nat a reasonable rate,\nand you might even say, or find yourself\ndiagnosed with prolonged grief disorder\nor with complicated grief syndrome\nin a way that's really impairing\nyour adaptive functioning in life,\nwell then, it's not clear to me,\nat least by my read of the data,\nthat you would want to\nengage in a lot of practices\nto increase the mind/body relationship\nand feeling so much of this attachment,\nbecause you're already feeling\nan immense amount of it.\nWhereas other people who\nare feeling challenged\nin accessing the feelings of attachment,\nand perhaps not functioning well\nas a consequence of that,\nmight find that practicing breathing\nin order to encourage\nrespiratory sinus arrhythmia,\nagain, focusing on slowing\nyour heart rate consciously\nwhile you exhale,\nand concentrating on\nincreasing your heart rate\nas you inhale,\neven just as a brief practice\nof even just one to three\nminutes or one to five minutes,\nevery once in a while or per day,\nthat could be immensely beneficial\nin building this mind/body relationship.\nBecause again, what this\npaper really points to\nand set off a number of other\ninvestigations related to,\nis that for those that can really feel\nthe relationship between\nbreathing heart rate,\nwhat we call vagal tone,\nwell, those people are going\nto be in a better position\nto move through grief,\nnot because they are disengaging\nfrom the feelings of attachment,\nbut because they are better able\nto access those feelings of attachment.\nSo what this relates to of\ncourse is that tripartite map,\nthat three-part map that\nwe talked about earlier,\nthat representation of\nspace, where things are,\nwhere the person is, where\ntheir belongings are,\nwhere their car is,\nwhere their bicycle is,\ntime, when you were expecting to see them\non a regular basis,\nwhen they would call,\nwhen they would come home\nfrom work, et cetera,\nand that third node,\nor that third dimension of attachment,\nwhich is literally\nattachment and closeness.\nWell, what we're talking about here\nis anchoring to that attachment\nand really feeling into that,\nbut then disengaging from\nthe space and time map\nthat we call episodic memory,\nthat menu of prior experiences,\nthat keeps us in many ways,\nmaladaptively in an expectation\nof what never can be again.\nNow I'd like to take a moment and consider\nsome of the tools that you can access\nthat support healthy\ntransitioning through grief.\nAnd these are tools distinct\nfrom that neural map,\nthat space, time and\ncloseness attachment map\nthat we were talking about before.\nRather, it's important to remind ourselves\nthat everything exists\nin a context of our baseline physiology.\nAnd I'm certainly not\ngoing to be the first\nor the last to tell you\nthat everything in life,\nlearning, relationships with\npeople that are still around,\nour health in every way,\nimmune system, et cetera,\nfunction far better when\nwe're sleeping really well,\nand when we are generally\nawake during the daytime\nand asleep at night.\nI realize there are\nshift workers out there,\npeople who are traveling\nand are jet-lagged.\nFirst of all, thank you, shift workers.\nWe rely on you.\nWe have an episode all about\njet lag and shift work,\nfor you and for trying to maintain\nthe best possible mental\nand physical health\nin the face of ongoing\nshift work and jet lag.\nYou can find that episode\non our website, hubermanlab.com.\nLots of behavioral tools,\nsome other tools as well.\nNonetheless, human beings are diurnal.\nWe were really designed to\nbe awake mostly in the day\nand asleep at night.\nThere are rare exceptions to this\nwhere people like to stay\nup late and sleep in late.\nBut we are a diurnal species,\nby way of our genetic wiring\nand our neural circuit wiring.\nThere's a particular\nfeature to our diurnal,\nand diurnal, meaning the\nopposite of nocturnal,\nour diurnal pattern of the release\nof a hormone called cortisol.\nCortisol is a stress hormone,\nit's sometimes called,\nbut cortisol has a lot of other effects,\nmany of which are positive.\nCortisol for instance,\nprotects us against infection.\nIt can help us in terms of\nwaking up in the morning.\nIn fact, the pulse as it's called\nor the spike in cortisol early in the day\nis part of the reason we wake up.\nIt's linked to our increase\nin temperature rhythms,\nand can further increase our temperature,\nwhich leads to waking, and so on.\nThe typical pattern of cortisol\nin a healthy individual,\nand we really can say physically\nand emotionally healthy individual,\nis that cortisol is going to be\nsomewhat high right around waking,\nand then is going to be\nhighest as it ever will be\nin the 24-hour period, about\n45 minutes post waking,\nnot exactly 45 minutes,\nbut about 45 minutes.\nAnd then it will drop gradually,\nsuch that by about 4:00\np.m. in the afternoon,\nwhich is actually when body temperature\ntends to start to drop as well,\ncortisol tends to be very low,\nand then remains low in\na healthy individual,\nsuch that at 9:00 p.m., it's very low.\nAnd throughout the night\nas we sleep, it's very low.\nIn fact, spikes or pulses\nin 9:00 p.m. cortisol\nare a fairly reliable biomarker readout\nof certain forms of depression\nand chronic anxiety.\nThis relates to the beautiful\nwork of my colleagues\nat Stanford and Stanford\nSchool of Medicine,\nDr. David Spiegel, who's\nbeen on this podcast,\nand Dr. Robert Sapolsky, who\nhas also been on this podcast.\nThere's a very interesting paper\nexploring the relationship\nbetween cortisol rhythms\nand grieving, in particular,\ncomplicated versus\nnon-complicated grieving.\nAgain, complicated grieving\nbeing the form of grieving\nthat reflects a immense challenge\nof people moving through\nthe grieving process,\nsuch that it really needs\nto be dealt with, right?\nAgain, grieving is healthy,\nbut complicated grieving\nis a prolonged grieving,\nand has other dimensions as well,\nhence the name complicated.\nThe title of this paper is,\n\"Diurnal Cortisol in Complicated\nand Non-Complicated Grief,\nSlope Differences Across the Day.\"\nAnd the figure to orient to in this paper,\nif you do decide to check it out,\nand we'll put a link to it,\nis Figure One, which beautifully shows,\nor I should say very clearly shows,\nthat in individuals that are\nexperiencing complicated grief,\nthere's the same general contour\nof high cortisol upon waking,\neven higher about 45 minutes after waking,\nand then a reduction in\ncortisol by 4:00 p.m.,\nand even further reduction by 9:00 p.m.,\nso just as it were in\na typical individual,\nor somebody who is in\nnon-complicated grieving.\nHowever, when you compare\nthe cortisol levels\nbetween people experiencing\ncomplicated grieving\nversus non-complicated grieving,\nwhat you find is the 4:00 p.m.\nand 9:00 p.m. cortisol levels\nare significantly higher than they are\nin the non-complicated grieving group.\nThis raises a very interesting idea,\nand relates very closely\nto what we were talking\nabout with vagal tone.\nYou could imagine a situation\nin which people who are\nexperiencing complicated grief\nhave higher levels of afternoon\nand nighttime cortisol,\nbecause they are in complicated grief,\nbut you could also imagine the opposite,\nthat they're experiencing\ncomplicated grief\nbecause of the fact that\nthey have elevated cortisol.\nNow, it's very likely\nthat it's bidirectional,\nthat the answer isn't one\nor the other, but both,\nthat complicated grief\nchanges patterns of cortisol,\nand that patterns of cortisol\nchange the likelihood\nthat one has complicated grief.\nThat's the most logical\ninterpretation of data like these.\nHowever, when taken along\nwith the data on vagal tone,\nthat people who have a\nhigher level of vagal tone\nare better able to navigate\nsituations of the sort\nthat we're talking about,\nand that some people perhaps\nhave oxytocin receptors\nor patterns of catecholamines\nor epinephrine,\nthat position them to be more likely\nto grieve in a particular way,\nwe arrive at a scenario where\nit makes very good sense\nto think about modulating,\nthat is controlling the\nfoundation of your life,\nin a way that establishes\ncortisol rhythms,\nand sleep patterns,\nand patterns of autonomic\narousal and catecholamine release\nthat position you to\nnavigate the grief process\nin the best possible way.\nIf that was a complicated\nmouthful to digest,\nlet me restate it in a simpler way.\nIf you are somebody who\nis heading into grief\nor is challenged with grief,\ncomplicated grief, or otherwise,\nprolonged grief or otherwise,\ngetting adequate sleep at night\nand establishing as normal a\npattern of cortisol as possible\nis going to be very important.\nAnd there's a very simple,\nstraightforward way to do this.\nAnd I apologize to the listeners\nof this podcast in advance,\nif I sound like a repeating record,\nbut the most powerful way to do this\nis to view sunlight, very close to waking.\nIt does not have to be right at sunrise,\nbut when you get up in the morning,\nif the sun isn't out,\nplease turn on as many bright lights\nas possible in your environment.\nAnd then once the sun is out,\ntry and get some bright\nsunlight in your eyes.\nNever look at any light so bright\nthat it's painful to look\nat, sunlight or otherwise.\nIf you live in an area of the world\nwhere there isn't a lot of sunlight,\nplease keep in mind that sunlight\ncoming through cloud cover\nis going to still be a\nvery effective mechanism\nfor establishing this cortisol rhythm.\nWhy do I say this thing about sunlight\nover and over and over again?\nWell, having an early day cortisol peak\nand a very low cortisol\nlevel late in the day,\n4:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m.,\nis immensely beneficial.\nIt's, reflects a properly regulated\nautonomic nervous system.\nIt means being alert during the day.\nAnd your ability to sleep at\nnight is tightly correlated\nto this viewing of\nsunlight in the morning.\nIf you have additional\nquestions about this\nor these protocols,\nplease see our \"Mastering\nSleep\" episode also\nat hubermanlab.com.\nBut in brief, you don't\nwant to wear sunglasses\nwhen you do this.\nYou do not want to do this\nthrough a window or a windshield.\nIt is 50 times less effective at least,\nbecause of filtering of\nthe proper wavelengths.\nIt is fine to wear eyeglasses,\nmeaning corrective lenses or contacts,\neven if they have UV protection.\nAgain, sunlight is best\n10 minutes to 30 minutes,\ndepending on how bright it is outside,\nand so on and so forth.\nI keep coming back to this protocol,\nbecause first of all, it is a zero cost,\nbut very effective way to regulate things\nlike cortisol rhythms, melatonin rhythms,\nwakefulness during the day,\nease of falling asleep\nat night, and so on,\nand second of all, because\nI want to emphasize\nthis idea of modulation.\nThere are processes in our brain and body\nwhich directly mediate\nsome psychological effect\nor physiological effect, right?\nDopamine is directly\ninvolved in motivation.\nIf you're somebody who\nstruggles with motivation,\nyour dopamine system is likely\nto be dysregulated in some way.\nAnd there are behavioral tools\nand other tools to adjust that.\nWe had an episode on\ndopamine motivation and drive\nthat talks extensively about those tools.\nHowever, the process of\ngrief can't be distilled\ndown to one molecule, one circuit,\nsuch that we can say, \"Oh,\nyou know, take this supplement\nor eat this diet and/or\nexercise in the following way,\nand you'll recover from\ngrief more quickly.\"\nIt's simply not the case.\nIt is the case, however,\nthat proper sleep at\nnight sets the foundation\nfor the proper emotional tone,\nto be able to navigate\nphysical, psychological,\nand other types of challenges,\nand not incidentally, sleep at night,\nI should say, sufficient duration\nand quality of sleep at night\nis the way in which you\nengage neuroplasticity,\nthe reordering of neural connections,\nand everything we've\nbeen talking about today\nabout reordering of the maps in your mind.\nThis tripartite, three-part map\nof space, time, and closeness\ninvolves neuroplasticity,\nthe reconfiguring of\nconnections between neurons,\nstrengthening certain pathways,\nand not strengthening others,\nactively trying to disengage\nfrom the what if, right,\nthis counterintuitive thinking,\nactively trying to disengage\nfrom the expectations\nthat someone will be there,\nalthough when you find\nyourself doing that,\nunderstanding why it's so\nreflexive and normal to do that,\nactively trying to lean\ninto the real attachment\nto somebody, animal, or thing,\nand yet at the same time,\nnot deluding yourself\nand undermining the whole\nprocess of grieving,\nby trying to imagine that they are in fact\nstill, truly there, right?\nIt's a very narrow\nknife edge of a process,\nwhich is why it's so challenging.\nRegulating your cortisol\nrhythm through viewing sunlight\nearly in the day, and I should also say,\navoiding bright lights\nfrom artificial sources\nin the evening, generally\n10:00 p.m. to 4:00 a.m,\nbut certainly in the evening,\ntrying to dim lights in\nyour immediate environment,\ntrying to avoid bright screens,\nbright artificial lights\nas much as possible,\nand accessing that deep sleep,\nthat's modulating, it's setting\nan overall autonomic state\nor an overall autonomic landscape,\nwould be the better way to describe it,\nthat's going to allow you to sleep\nand get neuroplasticity,\nsleep and be in the best emotional state\nto navigate the grieving process.\nBecause it's only fair to say\nthat the grieving process as\nwe're describing it is hard,\nand not just because\nit's emotionally hard.\nIt's cognitively hard.\nYou just think about what's required\nto move through grief\nproperly, if you will.\nIt's thinking about,\nand actually physically\nexperiencing the depth,\nthe full depth of the\nattachment to the person,\nwhile at the same time trying to uncouple\nfrom that rich menu, that\ncatalog of episodic memories\nthat can date back many, many years\nand have so much richness.\nSo many predictions form on the basis\nof those episodic memories,\nand actively trying to distance ourselves\nfrom those memories,\nby being very anchored in\nthe fact that we are present,\nwe are the person alone in that room,\nor in some cases with a\nbereavement group in that room,\nor with other people that\nare mourning the loss\nof that individual, animal, or thing,\nand that knife edge of feeling\nthe intense attachment,\nwhile also disengaging from all the things\nthat led to that attachment.\nWell, it's understandable\nwhy that would be so challenging,\nand it should also be understandable\nwhy positioning yourself\nto be able to do that\nin the best possible way\nrequires proper sleep.\nSo what are the tools that\nwe can think about using,\nin terms of healthy, adaptive\nmoving through grief,\ntrying to avoid complicated grief\nand prolonged grief disorders?\nI realize that word disorder\nimplies all sorts of things,\nbut again, those are just\nnaming categorizations\nthat people come up with,\nthat I think fairly reflect the fact\nthat some people have more challenge\nmoving through grieving than others.\nAnd for some people it\ncan be very extended.\nI think the common misunderstanding\nis that proper grieving involves\nmoving through something quickly.\nWe're certainly not saying that.\nHowever, it is very clear that\nsome people can get stuck,\nand that process of getting stuck,\nyou should now understand,\nhas a lot to do with maintaining\nor reactivating those episodic memories,\nthose expectations of\nwhere somebody will be\nin space and time.\nSo what can we say about the\ntools for moving through grief?\nClearly it's of value to\ndedicate some period of time,\nperhaps every day,\nperhaps every other day,\ndepending on your capacity and schedule.\nThese could be periods\nof time ranging anywhere\nfrom five to 45 minutes, maybe longer.\nThese blocks of time would\nbe appropriately described\nas rational grieving, right?\nRational grieving is a clear acceptance\nof the new reality that\nthe person, animal,\nor thing no longer exists\nin the same space/time dimensionality\nthat we knew them before,\nand yet holding on to an anchoring\nto the attachment that we had.\nThis is again, not an unhealthy\nanchoring to the attachment.\nThis is really anchoring to the depth\nand the intensity of the\nattachment that existed,\nas a way to, for lack of\na better way to put it,\npush off from those episodic memories,\nto distance ourselves from them.\nBecause those episodic\nmemories are the ones\nthat lead us to look for the\nperson in our current reality.\nAnd assuming this is a\nreal and complete loss,\nthose sorts of expectations\nare maladaptive.\nThey do not serve us well.\nThe second aspect of this is to understand\nthat the node of the map,\nthe component of the neural\nmap that you're anchoring to,\nis a very real component of you.\nThese are literally cells\nthat represent the depth of attachment.\nThey are linked up with your\nemotional centers in the brain,\nand indeed they're\nlinked up with your body.\nI think one of the things\nthat comes up so often\nwhen people are grieving is\nwhy does it hurt so much?\nWell, that hurt is that yearning.\nIt's that anticipation of action\nthat you want to engage in,\nbut some part of you at least\nknows that it leads nowhere.\nIt's that reaching for that glass of water\nin a kind of desert of thirst,\nand you know you can't have it.\nThat's why it hurts so badly,\nbecause the systems of your brain and body\nare in a place of\nanticipation of readiness.\nAnd given the activation of\nthese brain reward systems\nlike the nucleus accumbens,\ngiven your now understanding of oxytocin,\nbeing more enriched in\nthe nucleus accumbens\nof some individuals and\nas opposed to others,\nit should make perfect sense\nas to why it's so painful in your body.\nWe talked a moment ago about\nthe importance of accessing\nquality sleep on a regular basis,\ngave you at least one tool to do that.\nThere are again, a rich\narray of tools to do that\nin the \"Mastering Sleep\" episode.\nAnd again, highlighting\nthe importance of sleep\nfor not just emotion regulation\nand autonomic control,\nwhich is so vital, but\nalso for making sure\nthat neuroplasticity takes place.\nBecause again, neuroplasticity\nis a two-part process.\nThere's the triggering of the plasticity,\nwhich in the case of the things\nwe're talking about today,\nwill be naturally\nactivated by the practice\nof a dedicated focusing on the attachment,\nfeeling the attachment to the person,\nmaybe even writing about the\nattachment to the person,\nas was described in that previous study,\nbut also just the\nplasticity is triggered by\nthe mere loss of that person,\nthe intensity of that experience.\nBut neuroplasticity, the\nliteral rewiring of connections,\noccurs during deep sleep\nand in what I call\nnon-sleep deep rest or NSDR.\nAnd you can find NSDR scripts,\nthese are short behavioral protocols\nthat you do for 10 to 30 minutes\nat some point throughout the day,\nmaybe even multiple\ntimes through your day,\nthat have been shown to\naccelerate neuroplasticity.\nSo having a such a practice\ncan be very useful,\nand understand that it\ninvolves some cognitive work.\nWe have to hold onto the attachment,\nand imagine and feel as much\nas we can, the attachment,\nwhile also being extremely\nrationally grounded,\nand trying to not try\nto hold onto the past,\ntrying to not anticipate the\nperson walking in the room.\nThis is very hard because\nwhen we think about the attachment,\nthe attachment tends to drag with it\nthose episodic memories,\nthat rich catalog of experiences.\nThe expectation that they\nwill walk in the room\nis perfectly natural.\nThe hard cognitive work\nis to experience the deep,\nemotional attachment,\nwhile at the same time severing from\nor distancing ourselves\nfrom these expectations\nthat they'll suddenly\nshow up in our reality,\nwhen in fact, they won't.\nAnd we talked about preparing\nourselves for grief, right?\nIf we have a loved one that's dying,\nor we anticipate that at some point\nwe are going to have a loss of some sort,\ncould be death,\ncould be a loss of another type,\nbreakup, et cetera,\nthat we can prepare ourselves\nto grieve more adaptively\nby regulating the level of catecholamines,\nin particular epinephrine,\nthat was well-described in the study\nthat I referred to earlier,\nand tools such as the one found\nin our \"Mastering Stress\" episode,\nand tools of the sort that\nwe talked about today,\nincreasing that vagal tone\nby actively building up the relationship\nbetween exhales and slowing\ndown of the heart rate,\nso-called respiratory sinus arrhythmia.\nThose things can be very useful tools.\nSo we can actually\nencourage our nervous system\nand build our nervous system\nand build our mind to prepare for grief\nwhen it inevitably will come.\nAgain, this is not about\nbuffering ourselves\nfrom the realities of life.\nThis is not about disengaging from grief\nas a real and important process.\nAnd indeed, it is a real and\nimportant process to engage in.\nThose that enter denial,\nor try and distract\nthemselves with substances\nor thinking or distracting of behavior,\nsubstances or otherwise,\nwon't move through grief\nas well, as adaptively,\nas those who embrace a process of the sort\nthat I'm describing here.\nAnd of course, I want to restate again,\nthat even though grief and depression\nare now known to be\nfundamentally different,\neven though people move through\nthe different stages of grief\nat different rates and sometimes\nskip stages, et cetera,\nit is often important to access\na trained professional psychologist,\nor psychiatrist, or both,\nor bereavement group,\nor all of the above,\nin order to get the proper\nsupport for grieving.\nSo this is a podcast about\nscience and science-based tools,\nbut I absolutely want to emphasize\nthat there are terrific\nresources out there\nthat you can access.\nI don't say this in any kind of glib\nor kind of pass the buck kind of way.\nThere are wonderful trained therapists,\nbereavement groups,\npsychiatrists that are expert\nin navigating these sorts of things.\nI like to think that the tools\nthat we've talked about today\nwould be not only compatible,\nbut would be complementary\nto the sorts of approaches that they take.\nAnd as we think about\nthis process of grief,\nas we all should at\nsome point in our lives,\nbecause we all indeed\nwill experience grief\nin one form or another,\nI would hope that the information\nthat we discussed today\nwould not only give you some tools,\nbut hopefully give you\na better understanding\nof not just the people that you've lost\nor that you stand to lose,\nnot just the animals that\nyou've lost and stand to lose,\nbut also give you a sense of why it is\nthat the people who are still in your life\nand that you're attached to,\nthe animals that are still in your life,\nthat you're attached to,\nhave such profound meaning for you.\nAnd I would encourage you\nto not lean away from,\nbut rather to lean into the building\nof those episodic memories,\nto build up a richer and\nricher set of experiences\nand emotional attachments.\nBecause while the process of grieving\nis in direct relation to how close\nwe are attached to people,\nthere are ways to move through it.\nAnd of course it is the\ndepth of our attachments,\nand the number and the depth of meaning\nof experiences that we share\nwith others and with animals\nthat makes life so rich and worth living.\nSo I just want to take a\nmoment and say thank you\nfor being willing to explore\nthis rather complicated,\nand sometimes extremely challenging thing\nthat we call grief,\nfrom the perspective or through the lens\nof neuroscience and psychology.\nI certainly learned a lot in\nexploring this literature.\nI also really look\nforward to hosting people\nlike Dr. O'Connor on the podcast,\nand others on the podcast\nwho've done such beautiful\nwork in this area.\nI've put out the request,\nand hopefully they'll join us soon\nto further elaborate and teach us\nabout this fundamental\ncomponent of our lives.\nIf you are learning from and\nare enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to us on YouTube.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to the podcast\non Spotify and Apple,\nand at both Spotify and Apple,\nyou can leave us up to a five star review.\nIf you have comments and\nsuggestions, feedback,\nor you'd like to see a\nparticular guest on this podcast,\nplease put those suggestions, comments,\nand feedback in the\nComments section on YouTube.\nIn addition, please check out the sponsors\nmentioned at the beginning\nof today's podcast.\nThat's the best way to support us.\nNot during today's episode,\nbut on many previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe've discussed supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like easing and accelerating\nthe transition time into sleep,\nand getting better, deeper sleep,\nas well as things such\nas focus, et cetera.\nWe've partnered with\nMomentous Supplements,\nbecause Momentous\nSupplements, first of all,\nare of extremely high quality.\nThat's obviously important.\nAlso, they ship internationally.\nWe had heard from many of you\nthat you were having trouble\naccessing some of the supplements\nthat were described on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbecause you did not live in the U.S.\nMomentous ships both\nwithin the U.S. and abroad.\nAnd many of you have also requested\nthat there be a single site\nwhere you could access\nall of the supplements\nthat we've talked about on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nRight now at livemomentous.com/huberman,\nyou can find a subset of the supplements\nthat have been described on this podcast.\nAgain, all of the very highest quality.\nEach, single-ingredient supplements.\nThat turns out to be very important\nif you're trying to develop\nthe proper array of supplements for you.\nIt's not helpful to have supplements\nthat include many ingredients,\nso we encouraged Momentous\nto have single-ingredient supplements\nwith dosages that allow you to build up\nfrom the minimal\neffective dose, and so on.\nAnd the catalog of supplements\nthey are going to add to that location,\nlivemomentous.com/huberman,\nis going to expand in the\nweeks and months to come.\nAnd we expect that in a\nfairly short amount of time,\nall of the supplements\nthat we've described\non the Huberman Lab Podcast will be there.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing @hubermanlab\non Instagram and Twitter,\nI post science and science-related tools\n@hubermanlab on Instagram,\nalso @hubermanlab on Twitter.\nOftentimes that material\nwill overlap somewhat\nwith the content covered on this podcast,\nbut more often than not,\nwhat I'm covering on Instagram and Twitter\nis distinct from the information I cover\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nWe also have a newsletter that\nhas summaries of podcasts,\nand points to specific protocols and links\nthat could be useful to you.\nThat is the Neural Network Newsletter,\nand you can find it at hubermanlab.com.\nGo to the menu, go to Newsletter.\nYou can sign up simply\nby giving us your email.\nWe do not share your\nemail with anybody else.\nOur privacy policy is there,\nand is made very clear.\nYou can also see some\nnewsletters of months past,\nso you can assess whether or not\nyou really do want to sign up,\nalthough I like to think that you will.\nAgain, zero cost, total\nprivacy of your email account,\nand many people find those Summaries\nand Takeaway Tools to be very useful\nin navigating these admittedly\nlong podcast episodes.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[light contemporary music fades]"
