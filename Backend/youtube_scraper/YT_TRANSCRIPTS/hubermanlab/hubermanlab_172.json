    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology at\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. Wendy Suzuki.\nDr. Suzuki is a professor of\nneuroscience and psychology\nat New York University and\none of the leading researchers\nin the area of learning and memory.\nHer laboratory has contributed fundamental\ntextbook understanding of how brain areas\nsuch as the hippocampus, which\nyou will learn about today,\nhow the hippocampus and\nrelated brain circuits allow us\nto take certain experiences\nand commit them to memory\nso that we can use that\ninformation in the future.\nDr. Suzuki is also an\nexpert public educator\nin the realm of science.\nA few years back, she had a TED talk\nthat essentially went viral.\nIf you haven't seen it\nalready, you should absolutely\ncheck it out in which she\ndescribes her experience\nusing exercise as a way to\nenhance learning and memory.\nAnd on the basis of that\npersonal experience,\nshe reshaped her laboratory\nto explore how things\nlike meditation,\nexercise, and other things\nthat we can do with our\nphysiology and our psychology\ncan allow us to learn faster,\nto commit things to memory longer,\nand, indeed, to reshape\nour cognitive performance\nin a variety of settings.\nAs such, I am delighted to\nannounce that Dr. Suzuki\nis now not only running a\nlaboratory at New York University,\nbut she is the incoming\nDean of Arts and Science\nat New York University.\nAnd of course she was\nselected for that role\nfor her many talents, but\none of the important aspects\nof her program, she\ntells me, is going to be\nto incorporate the incredible\npower of exercise, meditation,\nand other behavioral practices\nfor enhancing learning,\nfor improving stress\nmanagement, and other things\nto optimize student performance.\nToday, you are going to get access to much\nof that information so that\nyou can apply those tools\nin your daily life, as well.\nDr. Suzuki is also an author\nof several important books.\nThe most recent one is entitled\n\"Good Anxiety: Harnessing the Power\n\"of the Most Misunderstood\nEmotion,\" and a previous book\nentitled \"Healthy Brain, Happy Life:\n\"A Personal Program to Activate your Brain\n\"and Do Everything Better.\"\nAnd while that is admittedly\na very pop science-type title,\nI will remind you that she is one\nof the preeminent memory\nresearchers in the world\nand has been for quite a while,\nso the information that\nyou'll glean from those books\nis both rich in depth and\nbreadth and is highly applicable.\nBy the end of today's discussion,\nyou will have learned from\nDr. Suzuki a large amount\nof knowledge about how\nmemories are formed,\nhow they are lost, and you\nwill have a much larger kit\nof tools to apply for your\nefforts to learn better,\nto remember better, and\nto apply that information\nin the ways that best serve you.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my\ndesire and effort to bring\nzero-cost-to-consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin, mineral, probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking\nAthletic Greens, and the reason\nI still take Athletic\nGreens once or twice a day,\nis that it meets all my\nfoundational vitamin, mineral,\nand probiotic needs.\nIn fact, whenever people ask\nme if I were to only take\none supplement, which\nsupplement should I take?\nI tell them Athletic Greens\nfor the simple reason that\nit covers your base of vitamins,\nminerals, and probiotics,\nit also has important adaptogens,\ndigestive enzymes for gut health.\nAll of this is very\nimportant because we now know\nthat gut health and the\nso-called gut-brain axis\nis very important for things\nlike mood and brain function,\nand also contributes to\nimmune system function.\nWith Athletic Greens, you're\ncovering all those bases.\nAnd of course you need\nto eat the nutrition\nand healthy diet that's right for you,\nbut by taking Athletic\nGreens once or twice a day,\nyou can be sure that there\nare going to be no gaps\nor deficiencies in your vitamin,\nmineral, or probiotic needs.\nI mix mine with water and\na little bit of lemon juice\nor lime juice, I personally\nfind it delicious.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2,\nboth of which are also vital\nfor immediate and long-term health.\nSo once again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can get a special offer\nof five free travel packs\nto make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're in the car\nor otherwise traveling.\nPlus, they'll give you the\nyear's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long-term\nhealth can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insight\ninto, for instance,\nwhat your biological\nage is and compare that\nto your chronological age.\nAnd of course your\nbiological age is the number\nthat really matters.\nWith InsideTracker, there's\na distinct advantage\nand the advantage is that while\nthere are many blood tests\nand DNA tests out there,\nInsideTracker's blood\nand DNA tests come also with a platform,\nmeaning a website platform\nthat allows you to see\nexactly what you could\nor should do in order\nto adjust the numbers on\nthings like hormone levels,\nmetabolic factors, and lipids, and so on.\nIt's a little popup window,\nit points to nutritional, supplementation,\nand behavioral regimens\nthat you can take in order\nto put those numbers in the\nranges that are optimal for you.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Blinkist.\nBlinkist is an app that has\nthousands of non-fiction books,\neach condensed down to just 15 minutes\nof key takeaways for those books.\nI love reading books from front to back.\nI like the actual physical book.\nI'm sort of old-fashioned in that way.\nAnd I do also listen to audiobooks.\nIt's very rare that I don't\nfinish a book that I've started.\nNonetheless, I like to revisit\nsome of my favorite books,\nI also like to write down key\ntakeaways from those books.\nsometimes even before I listen\nto the full-length book.\nSo I don't mind spoiling the\ntakeaways because when I read\nnon-fiction, generally\nI'm trying to extract\nthe most valuable knowledge from them.\nSo I'll often listen to a\nBlinkist 15-minute version,\nthen the full-length book,\nor sometimes the full-length book,\nand then the Blinkist 15-minute version.\nEither way, Blinkist is a great\nway to get through any book\nand to extract the best from those books.\nI've used it for, for instance,\nMatt Walker's \"Why We\nSleep,\" an excellent book\non why we sleep as well as Tim\nFerriss's \"The 4-Hour Body,\"\nNassim Taleb's \"The Black\nSwan,\" and so on, and so on.\nWith Blinkist, you get\nunlimited access to read\nor listen to a massive\nlibrary of non-fiction books.\nIt really is a treasure\ntrove of information.\nRight now, Blinkist has a special offer\njust for Huberman Lab Podcast listeners.\nIf you go to blinkist.com/huberman,\nyou can get a free seven-day trial\nand 25% off a Blinkist premium membership.\nOnce again, go to\nblinkist.com/huberman to get\na seven-day free trial and 25% off.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Wendy Suzuki.\nWendy, great to see you\nagain and to have you here,\nit's been a little while.\n- It's been a while, so\ngreat to be here, Andrew.\nthank you so much for having me.\n- Yeah, delighted.\nI'd like to start off by\ntalking about memory generally,\nand then I'd love to chat\nabout your incredible work,\ndiscovering how exercise\nand memory interface\nand what people can do\nto improve their memory\nand brain function generally.\n- Yes.\n- But for those\nthat are not familiar, maybe\nyou could just step us through\nthe basic elements of memory,\na few brain structures, perhaps.\n- Sure.\n- You know, what happens\nwhen I, for instance, this mug of tea\nis pretty unremarkable.\nBut the fact that now\nI've talked about it,\nI don't know that I'll\never forget about it.\nMaybe I will, maybe I won't.\nSo what happens when I\nlook at this mug and decide\nthat it's something special\nfor whatever reason?\n- Yeah, well, I like to\nsay there are four things\nthat make things memorable.\nNumber one is novelty.\nIf it's something new,\nthe very first thing,\nthe very first time we've seen something\nor experienced something,\nour brains are drawn to that,\nour attentional systems draw us to that.\nAnd when you are paying\nattention to something,\nthat's part of what\nmakes things memorable.\nSecond is repetition.\nIf you see that cup of\ntea every single day,\nand every single time you do an interview\nyou talk about your cup of tea,\nyou're going to remember it.\nThat's just how our brains\nwork, repetition works.\nThird is association.\nSo if you meet somebody new\nthat knows lots of people that you know,\nso you and I share many, many, many,\nmany people that we both know.\nIt's easy to remember, it's\neasier to remember you,\nespecially if you were\nsomebody new that I hadn't\nmet before, we have met\nbefore, so association.\nAnd then the fourth one\nis emotional resonance.\nSo we remember the happiest\nand the saddest moments of our lives,\nand that also includes\nfunny, surprising things.\nThat is the interaction between\ntwo key brain structures,\nthe amygdala, which is\nimportant for processing\nlots of emotional,\nparticularly threatening kinds\nof situations, but those threatening,\nsurprising kinds of\nsituations, the amygdala takes\nthat information and makes\nanother key structure\ncalled the hippocampus work better\nto put new long-term\nmemories in your brain.\nSo that, in fact, is the key\nstructure for long-term memory,\nthis structure called the hippocampus.\n- Fantastic, so novelty,\nrepetition, association,\nand emotional resonance.\n- Yes.\n- Could you tell us a bit\nmore about the hippocampus?\nI think, at least for my generation, well,\nI'm a neuroscientist, but for\nmost people of my generation,\nI think they first heard\nabout the hippocampus\nfrom the movie \"Memento.\"\n- Oh yeah, yeah.\n- Where the guy\nsays hippocampus, and for those of you\nthat haven't seen that movie,\nit's a bizarrely constructed movie,\nbut an interesting one,\nnonetheless, about memory.\nBut even as a neuroscientist,\nsometimes I'm perplexed at\nhow the hippocampus works.\nMaybe you could, if you would,\nstep us through kind of\nwhat this structure is,\nwhat it looks like, maybe\na few of its subregions,\nbecause unlike vision,\nthe topic that I've worked\nmost of my career on, where we know, okay,\nthe eye does this part, and\nthe thalamus does this part,\nand the cortex does that\npart, I've always been\na little perplexed about\nthe hippocampus, frankly.\nAnd I've read the textbooks\nand I've heard the lectures,\nbut I'd love to get the update.\nWhat are the general\nthemes of the hippocampus\nas a structure and its function?\nWhat do you think everyone,\nincluding neuroscientists,\nshould know about the hippocampus?\n- Absolutely, so let's\nstart with the basics.\nThe word hippocampus means seahorse.\nIt is shaped, the structure is shaped,\nlike a kind of curlicue\nseahorse, that is accurate.\nEverybody, including\nneuroscientists, should know\nit's a beautiful structure.\nIt is visually, anatomically beautiful\nwith these kind of intertwining\ntwirly subregions within it.\nAnd I think that's one of the\nreasons why early anatomists,\nwho were the very first\nneuroscientists, got attracted to it\nbecause it's this interesting\nkind of twirly structure\ndeep in the heart of the brain.\nSo that's anatomically.\nFunctionally, what does it do?\nWell, it's easiest to\nunderstand what it does\nwhen you look at what happens\nwhen you don't have a hippocampus anymore.\nWhat if you, by some disease,\nor you have your hippocampus\nremoved by accident,\nwhat happens?\nWell, we know this from the most famous\nneurological patient of all\ntime, his initials were HM,\nso all psychology and\nneuroscience students know him.\nHe was operated in 1954 and the\npaper was published in 1957.\nThey removed both his\nhippocampi because he had\nvery terrible epilepsy and\nthey knew that the hippocampus\nwas the genesis of epilepsy.\nAnd this was experimental,\nhis epilepsy was so bad\nthat they decided not just to remove\none hippocampus, but both.\nAnd what happened was\nimmediate loss of all ability\nto form new memories for facts and events.\nThink about that for a\nsecond, all facts or events\nyou're not able to remember.\nI can't remember this\ninteraction between us.\nI can't remember any of\nthe facts that we were\njust chatting about in\nour neuroscience lives.\nNone of that can move\ninto our long-term memory.\nSo this hippocampus does something\nwith all of these perceptions\nthat are coming at us\nevery single day, every minute of the day,\nand not for all of them,\nbut for some of them\nthat have these features\nthat we just talked about,\nmaybe they're novel, maybe\nthey have associations,\nmaybe they're emotionally relevant,\nmaybe they've been repeated,\nsome of those things in the realm of facts\nor events get encoded\nin our long-term memory.\nAnd that's the textbook of why\nthe hippocampus is so important.\nI like to always add, and I mean,\nthis is why I studied\nit for so many years,\nthe hippocampus and what it does\nreally defines our own personal histories.\nIt means it defines who we are,\nbecause if we can't\nremember what we've done,\nthe information we've learned,\nand the events of our lives,\nit changes us, that's\nwhat really defines us.\nThat's why I wanted to\nstudy the hippocampus.\nAnd I think the exciting, new\nideas about the hippocampus\nis that it's, you know, hippocampus\nis important for memory,\nso if you say that,\nyou'll impress all your\npeople at your cocktail party,\nbut what people have started\nto realize that it's not\njust memory, it's not just\nputting together associations\nfor what, where, and when\nof events that happened\nin our past, but it's\nputting together information\nthat is in our long-term memory banks\nin interesting new ways.\nI'm talking about imagination.\nSo without the hippocampus,\nyes, you can't remember things,\nbut actually you're not able\nto imagine events or situations\nthat you've never experienced before.\nSo what that says is the\nhippocampus is important for memory\nis too simple a way to think about it.\nWhat the hippocampus is\nimportant for is what we've\nalready talked about, associating things\ntogether writ large.\nAnytime you need to\nassociate something together,\neither for your past, your\npresent, or your future,\nyou are using your hippocampus.\nAnd it takes on this\nmuch more important role\nin our cognitive lives when\nwe think about it like that.\nThat is kind of the new hippocampus\nthat neuroscientists\nare studying these days.\n- That's fantastic, so\nit sounds like it really\nsets context, but it can do that\nwith elements from the past,\nthe present, or the future.\n- Yes.\n- And for neuroscientists\nthe phrase is domain,\nwe say the time domain\nmeaning as opposed to just\nevaluating things in space,\nit sounds like the time domain\nof hippocampal functioning\nis incredibly interesting.\n- It is.\n- And even the fact that\nwe can have short-term,\nmedium-term, and long-term memories,\nand we could go down any\nof these rabbit holes.\nI'll ask you a true or\nfalse, mostly because\nI just really want to know the answer.\nA few years ago, the theme in\nvarious high-profile reviews\nseemed to be that the\nhippocampus was involved\nin encoding, in creating memories,\nbut not in storing memories\nand that the memory storage\nwas in the neocortex\nor the other overlying areas of the brain.\nIs that too general a statement?\n- That's a tricky statement\nbecause I think that ultimately,\nyes, that long-term memories\nare stored in the cortex,\nbut those memories are\nstored in the hippocampus\nsometimes for a very, very long time.\nSo how long is too long where you say, oh,\nit's not the hippocampus anymore?\nIf it's four years, does that mean that\nit's not stored in the hippocampus?\nI think that's a tricky question.\nAnd yes, it was coming\nup a lot because people\nwere debating it and some people did think\nthat you shouldn't think\nabout the hippocampus\nas a storage area, but I think it's\na long, long, long-term kind\nof intermediate storage area,\nmaybe not the long-term storage area.\nThat's why it's hard to\nanswer that question.\n- Great, as I recall,\nHM could remember facts\nfrom before his surgery.\n- Yes.\n- He couldn't form\nnew memories.\n- Correct.\n- And given that he had no hippocampus,\nit would at least\npartially support the idea\nthat some memories are retained\noutside the hippocampus.\n- However, he did have part\nof his posterior hippocampus intact.\nSo that's the tricky thing.\nI think initially, in fact, Scoville,\nthe neurosurgeon overestimated\nthe number of millimeters\nhe intended to remove of the hippocampus.\nAnd then when they did this,\nthe very historic MRI of HM\nlater in his life, they\nshowed that, in fact,\nhe did have that part of the\nposterior hippocampus intact.\nSo now it makes it a\nlittle bit more complicated\nto interpret what's going on.\nNot that it was never\nuncomplicated, any interpretation\nof a lesion in a patient,\nas you know, is complicated,\nbut HM had this mythical role\nin neuroscience and neurology\nand now it was complicated\nbecause he does have\nmore of the hippocampus intact.\n- Got it, I did not know that.\nThere are some memories that\ncan be formed very quickly,\nso called one-trial learning,\nand I'm just looking at\nthis list again, novelty,\nrepetition, association,\nand emotional resonance.\nIt seems like some experiences\ncan bypass the need\nfor multiple repetitions.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- And unfortunately it seems\nthat our nervous system\nis skewed toward creating\none-trial memories\nfor negative events.\n- Right.\n- Which has a survival adaptive mechanism.\nWhat is the neural connection\nthat allows that to happen?\nIs it the amygdala to\nhippocampus connection?\nI mean, as you and I know, it\nseems like every brain area\nultimately is connected\nto everything else.\nIt's just a question of\nthrough how many nodes,\njust like every city is\nconnected to another city,\nit's just a question of\nhow many flights and roads\ndo you have to traverse\nbefore you get there.\nWhat is it about one-trial learning?\nI mean, at a kind of top contour level,\nhow can we learn certain things so fast\nand other things are tricky?\nAnd now every time I\nlook at this white mug,\nit's queuing up something special\nsimply by virtue of saying it.\nSo is that one-trial memory?\nWhat is it about very\nemotionally salient events\nthat allow memories to get stamped in?\n- Yeah, I mean, I think\nyou've already alluded to it.\nThat is there is this protective\nfunction of our brains\nthat has evolved over the\nlast 2.5 million years\nthat you need to pay attention\nand remember certain\nthings for your survival.\nSo some things that get\nstamped in, they're memories,\nbut they're fear memories.\nIf I get mugged on the\nsubway or, you know,\nthere are terrible things that\ncould happen on the subway\nas we just learned.\nBut if something terrible happens,\nif something very scary\nhappens, you remember that,\nand that fear and that\nmemory of all those things,\nI mean, I have one when I\nlived in Washington, DC,\nI went to work at NIH on a\nSunday afternoon and I came back\nand when I rounded the corner\nto my door of my apartment,\nit was crowbarred in.\nSomebody had taken a crowbar,\nopened up my door, and stole\nall of the nicest things\nin my apartment, which wasn't that nice,\n'cause I wasn't making that much money.\nBut ever since then, whenever\nI rounded that corner,\nI still had that memory.\nIt was terrible because it\nput me in a terrible state\nwhen I was just coming home\nand that's a survival mechanism.\nDo you want to be alert\nto possible danger?\nAbsolutely yes.\nSo part of those one-trial\nmemories, I think,\nis often taking advantage of this\nevolutionarily developed\nsystem to tamp in things\nthat could be potentially\ndangerous to you into your memory.\nSo you forever will remember\nthis particular corner\nor this hallway because\nthat is where something\nreally bad happened to you.\n- It seems like a location.\nWe talk about conditioned place aversion,\nwhich is just a geek speak\nfor wanting to avoid the place\nwhere something bad happened,\nor conditioned place\npreference, wanting to go back\nto a place where something\npositive happened.\nOr even looking at a\nphotograph of where you had\na wonderful time with\nsomebody and that can evoke\nall sorts of positive sensations.\nIt seems like at some level,\nas complex as the brain is,\nthe basic elements of\nfeeling good or feeling lousy\nare states within the brain\nand body and linking those\nto places seems like it's a\npretty straightforward formula,\nyou know, link place to state,\nlink state to place, etc.,\nas your description just provided.\nWhen we learn more complex information,\na poem, a concept, or we\nhave to ratchet through\na set of ideas, that also involves memory.\nI'm sure that we'll talk more about this,\nbut is there any way that\nyou are aware of that state,\nbodily state can be leveraged\nto enhance the speed\nor the quality of memories\nand memory formation?\nSo to be clear about it,\nit seems there's something very\nimportant about this fourth,\nthis emotional resonance component.\nNovelty, the crowbar into the doors,\nthank goodness sounds like it was novel,\nit wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness.\nSo repetition is out and the association\nis very, very strong.\nBut for people trying to learn\ninformation that they're not\nthat excited about, or\nthat repetition is hard,\nor the novelty is simply\nthat it's painful.\n- Yes, I've been there, absolutely.\n- Yeah, as have I.\nIs there something that\nwe can do to leverage\nknowledge of how the memory\nsystem works naturally\nto make that a more\nstraightforward process?\n- So, I immediately turn to\nthe things that I've studied\nthat you talk about so\nbeautifully on your podcast,\nwhich are strategies generally to make\nyour brain work better.\nI was just reminding myself\nof your podcast about cold\nbecause I use that every morning.\n- Oh, you do cold?\n- I do, I do.\n- Just take a moment\nand, and just tell us,\nwhat is your cold exposure protocol,\nthen I'll take you back\nto what you're saying.\n- So my cold exposure\nprotocol is at the end\nof every morning shower that I take,\nthe shower is warm, but I give\nmyself a big blast of cold\nat the end of that and\nit makes me feel so good.\nAnd because I've been\ndoing it for several years,\nit's so much less painful.\nOkay, I admit, it was really\npainful at the beginning,\nbut it's much less painful.\nI could handle the cold water and my pipes\ngive nice, really cold water.\nAnd it just, I could feel\nthe awakedness kind of\ncome up in me after that.\nAnd I miss it, if I forget to do it,\nsometimes I run back in and\ngive myself that cold blast\nbecause it is upping,\nI think you talked about\nthis on your podcast,\nwhat's happening in the brain?\n- Basically the cold stimulus, that shock,\nthat catching your breath, etc.,\nis adrenaline from the adrenals.\nBut also from what we understand now,\nsome new neuroimaging, there's epinephrine\nand norepinephrine released\nfrom locus ceruleus,\nwhich again is a brain structure\nin the back of the brain,\nkind of sprinklers the rest of the brain\nwith a kind of a wake-up chemical.\nAnd there's a long arc\non dopamine release.\nThis paper back in 2000 showed\nthat it's a steady increase\nup to about 2.5x of circulating dopamine.\nSo they weren't looking directly\nin the brain admittedly,\nbut it goes on for four or five hours.\n- Wow, yeah.\n- So the improved mood\nand the feeling of\nalertness is a real thing.\n- Yeah, yeah, so I use that.\nI mean, so basically I\nuse my morning routine.\nWhat is my morning routine?\nI get up, I do a 45-minute tea meditation.\nSo meditating over the\nbrewing and drinking of tea\nthat I learned from a monk\nwho has an institute in Taiwan\nwhere he teaches tea meditation, love it.\nI've learned all about tea,\ndifferent kinds of tea.\nAnd then I do a 30-minute\ncardio weights workout.\nThen I take my shower with\nthe hot-cold contrast.\nAnd, oh, and before that, key thing,\nif I want to learn something\nand I want to be able\nto get over the difficulty\nof repeating things,\nor just push myself to do stuff, sleep,\nso good, good sleep.\nI've learned that over the pandemic,\nI did sleep experiments on\nmyself and I learned that I was\nsleeping an hour less\nthan I really needed.\nSo I really need seven-and-a-half\nto eight hours of sleep.\nAnd I was getting six and a half.\nAnd so now, I get that\nseven-and-a-half to eight hours\nevery single night, and guess what?\nI come to different difficult\ntasks and I am more willing\nto give it a try, to try longer,\nto try harder, and my brain works better.\nAnd so I think probably if you go back\nto all of your podcasts,\nyou'll learn exactly why\neach one of those things that I do,\nwhich I would bet that\nyou probably do, too,\nis helping my brain.\n- I guarantee they are.\nAnd I'm impressed that\nyou do all these things,\nalthough not surprised.\nAnd I should say that\nthe extra hour of sleep\nis really impressive and\nextremely beneficial.\nI'm curious, do you get that\nin the early part of the night\nby going to bed earlier?\n- Yeah.\n- Terrific, and I should just mention,\n'cause you're too humble to\ndo it, but I'll say it again\nthat not only are you a full professor,\ntenured full professor\nand running a laboratory,\nyou teach undergraduates,\nyou have an important\nrole in public education,\nmultiple books, and you're now\ndean of the College of\nArts and Sciences at NYU.\nSo the extra hour of\nsleep is benefiting you\nand as a consequence benefiting\neverybody else as well.\nThanks for sharing with us your protocol.\nI took you off the trajectory\nof what one can do,\nbut I think that people\nand I appreciate knowing\nkind of what the practical steps are.\nBecause knowing the science is important,\nmechanism I do believe is\nimportant for embedding protocols\nin people's minds and why\nthey might want to do them,\nbut really hearing the\nmechanics of it is useful.\nIt sounds like everything\ntogether takes about an hour,\nit's not an excessive amount of time,\nbut it probably gives you an outsized\npositive effect on your day.\n- Absolutely, I definitely notice it\nif I'm not able to do it.\nAnd when I don't, so I do\nthis seven days a week,\nit's also not just five\ndays, seven days a week.\nAnd when I can't do it,\nit's usually early-morning\nflights or things like that.\nAnd I get over it, but it's\ncritical for the working of my brain.\n- I love it and I'll just\nhighlight one thing that you said\nbefore we move on, which is\nthat you said when sometimes\nif you get out of the\nshower before the cold,\nyou'll get back in.\nThat's, to me, a really beautiful example\nof conditioned place preference.\nNow the cold shower has\nbecome something that\nyou sort of look forward to.\nI should say that nobody is\nimmune from the adrenaline\nincrease of cold, no matter how cold,\nthis is what's interesting about cold.\nIt's one of the reasons why\nit's such an important part\nof the screening for special operations,\nso our SEAL teams, but other\nbranches in military too,\nwhich is that there are very\nfew stimuli that you can give\nanyone and consistently get an adrenaline\n- Oh, interesting.\n- Release from that\nwithout harming them.\nWith heat, eventually you\nneed to use so much heat\nthat you damage tissue.\nOr with exercise, you have\nto use so much exercise\nthat you can damage joints.\nAnd it's this very kind of brilliant,\nI don't know if it was intentional or not,\nit's sort of unintentional\ngenius that special operations\nhas figured out that by sending\npeople back into the cold\nover and over, it never\nreally gets easier,\nbut over time people\nactually start to crave it\nand it provides this reduction\nin inflammation, etc.\nSo anyway, beautiful practice, thank you.\nI want to learn more\nabout your tea meditation\nlater in the episode.\nBut in any event returning to ways that\nwe can improve memory formation.\nMaybe if you would tell\nus your story around this.\nI know you've told it before,\nbut I think a lot of members\nof the audience and I\nwould love to hear how you came to this.\nBecause growing up in\nneuroscience, I knew you\nas one of the, I would say\none of the three or four,\nand they're all alongside one another,\nthis isn't a hierarchical statement,\nthree or four top memory\nresearchers in the world.\nTextbook material is Suzuki.\nMy textbooks are filled\nwith the word Suzuki,\nyour last name,\naccording to the information\non memory and memory formation.\nSo you were doing that\nand doing the things\nthat academics do, and then\nyou're still doing that,\nand still at a very high level,\nbut then things took\na different direction.\nAnd maybe we could talk about\nyour story and how you came\nto the place you are at now\nbecause I think it\nprovides a number of tools\nthat people could implement themselves.\n- Yeah, so this story\nhappened as I was working\nto get tenure at NYU.\nAnd, as you know, it's\na stress-filled process.\nThey give you six years to show your stuff\nand you are judged in front\nof all your colleagues.\nAnd either they say, okay,\nyou can join the club\nor they say, sorry, you are humiliated\nin front of everybody.\nThis was what was going on in my life.\n- They actually tell people to leave.\nIf you don't get tenure, you're gone.\n- You have to leave your institution.\nAnd so, you work really, really hard.\nAnd so my strategy was,\nI'm just going to not do anything but work\nand I'm just going to work.\nAnd I'm going to just work as hard\nas I can for the six years.\nAnd what happens when you\nwork and you don't have\nany sort of life outside of work\nand you live in New York\nwhere there's all sorts\nof really good takeout,\nyou gain 25 pounds,\nwhich is exactly what I did.\nAnd you get really, really stressed.\nAnd you start to ask\nyourself how come I'm living\nin New York City, and I love Broadway,\nand I haven't gone to a\nBroadway show in two years?\nAnd so I, 25 pounds overweight,\nI decided to go on vacation.\nAnd I went by myself\n'cause I had no friends.\nAnd I went to, I did\nan adventure river rafting trip in Peru.\nAnd so I go by myself and\nmeet other interesting people\nand I was the weakest\nperson on this whole trip.\nLike they were so much in better\nshape, it was embarrassing\nand they won't say this,\nthey won't admit this\nto me, but it was true.\nAnd I kind of came back and I said, okay,\nI cannot be the weakest person.\nI'm in my late 30s, I\nhave to do something.\nSo I went to the gym\nand I said, oh my God,\nI'm 25 pounds overweight,\nlet's try at least to lose this weight.\nAnd so I go to the gym, I\nnotice how much better I feel\nwhen I go to just a single class.\nI remember the very first class I went to\nwas a hip hop dance class.\nI'm a terrible hip hop dancer,\nbut I still felt good after that class.\nAnd then fast forward a year and a half,\nI've lost the 25 pounds,\nso proud of myself,\nso much happier.\nAnd I'm sitting in my office\ndoing what you and I do a lot,\nwhich is writing an NIH\ngrant, which is our lifeblood.\nAnd writing, writing, writing,\nand this thought goes\nthrough my mind that had\nnever gone through my mind before\nduring this six years\nof frantic grant writing\nwhen I was trying to get tenure,\nand that thought was grant\nwriting went well today.\nYou know, that felt good.\nI was like, I've never\nhad that thought before,\nwhat's going on here,\nthis is really weird?\n- I don't know that anyone\nhas had that thought before.\n- No, I'm sure people\nhave had that thought.\nBut I thought maybe I'm\njust having a good day.\nBut when I thought about it,\nI thought it's not just today.\nMy grant writing seems to\nhave been getting smoother,\nlike I'm able to focus longer,\nthe sessions feel better to me.\nAnd at that point, the only\nthing that I changed in my life,\nit was a huge thing, but I had become\na gym rat rather than a workaholic.\nAnd that's when my spidey\nsense for neuroscientists\npopped up and I said, what\ndo we know about the effects\nof exercise on your brain?\nBecause if I think about it,\nwhat was better about my\nwriting is I could focus longer\nand deeper, very important,\nand I could remember those\nlittle details that you try\nand pull together for your\nmillion dollar NIH grant\nfrom 30 different articles\nthat you have open\non your screen all at the same time,\nthat's the hippocampal memory.\nI was studying that, I\nwas writing the grant\non hippocampal memory.\nAnd so that's when I got really\ninterested in the effects\nof exercise on both prefrontal\nfocus and attention function\nand hippocampal function\nbecause of my own observation.\nI still remember where I was sitting,\nwhich office I was in,\nwhen I had this revelation.\nBut the thing that\nreally sealed it for me,\nthat made me think not just,\noh, this is interesting,\nbut I want to study this,\nis right around that time\nI got a phone call from my\nmom who said that my dad\nwasn't feeling well and\nthat he had told her\nthat he got lost driving\nback from the 7-11,\nwhich was literally seven\nblocks from our house\nthat I grew up in.\nAnd I knew that was hippocampal function.\nI suspected dementia. I suspected, oh,\ndidn't want to admit Alzheimer's dementia,\nwhich he had.\nAnd it was funny because,\nI mean it wasn't funny,\nbut my mom and dad are two\nsides of a very different coin.\nMy dad is the engineer,\nnot so active all his life,\nbut would loved and sit\nand read books all day.\nMy mom was the athlete.\nShe played team tennis into her 80s.\nAnd it started to show at that point.\nAnd so then I had even\na more pressing reason\nto think about what the\neffects of exercise were\nbecause I noticed that all\nthe things that were improving\nin my brain suddenly went\naway in my dad's brain.\nReally, really smart guy,\nengineer in Silicon Valley,\nhelped that push in Silicon\nValley in the '70s happen,\nhe had no more memory.\nHe couldn't focus his attention.\nHis mood was rock bottom,\nhe's a very happy guy.\nAnd everything was the opposite in me.\nAnd I started thinking this\nisn't just something to help\nsomebody who wants to get\ntenure, this is something\nthat could help millions\nand millions of people,\nmost importantly, our aging population.\nWhat if, you know, what's happening?\nAnd so the thing that makes\nme wake up in the morning is\nwhen I realized that every\nsingle time you move your body,\nyou are releasing a whole\nbunch of neurochemicals.\nAnd some of them we've talked about,\nthe good mood comes from\ndopamine, and serotonin,\nand noradrenaline, but the\nthing that gets released also,\nparticularly with aerobic\nexercise, is a growth factor\ncalled brain derived\nneurotrophic factor, or BDNF.\nAnd that is so important\nbecause what it does is it goes\ndirectly to your hippocampus\nand it helps brand new\nbrain cells grow in your hippocampus.\nWe all have that.\nEven if you're a couch potato,\nyou can get new brain cells\nin your hippocampus to grow.\nBut it's like giving\nyour hippocampus a boost\nwith this regular BDNF,\nif you are exercising.\nWhich means that we all\nhave the capacity to grow\na bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.\nAnd so what I like to\ngive people is this image\nof every single time you move your body,\nit's like giving your brain\nthis wonderful bubble bath\nof neurochemicals, what's going on,\nI need my bubble bath of\nnoradrenaline, and dopamine,\nand serotonin, and growth factors.\nAnd with regular bubble\nbaths, what am I doing?\nI'm growing a big fat, fluffy hippocampus.\nAnd I'm not going to cure\nmy father's dementia,\nAlzheimer's dementia, but you know what?\nIf I go into my 70s with a\nbig fat, fluffy hippocampus,\neven if I had that in my genes\nand it starts to kick in,\nit's going to take longer for\nthat disease to start to affect\nmy ability to form and\nretain new long-term memories\nfor facts and events, which is\nmy motivation for getting up\nand doing my 30 to 45 minutes\nof aerobic exercise every day.\n- Fantastic.\nQuick question about your\nprotocol just because.\nAnd then we'll discuss a few\nmechanistic things related\nto what signals the body\nmight be sending the brain\nand a little bit more detail\non BDNF and some circuitry.\nSo 30 to 45 minutes of, it sounds like\ncardiovascular exercise might be special.\nBut as I say that and I\nthink about the literature\nthat I'm aware of in\nmice and some in monkeys,\nand certainly in humans, looking\nat the effects of exercise\non brain function and\ntypically the outcome\nis improvement, almost always.\nI don't think I've ever\nseen a paper showing\nthat when animals or humans exercise more,\nthat their brain gets worse.\nI just can't think of a single paper.\nIt doesn't mean it doesn't exist.\nI'm sure someone will put\none in the comment section.\nThey'll find that one,\nand thank you for if you can find that,\nbut it seems like it's always\ncardiovascular exercise\nand experimentally in a lab\nit's a lot easier to get a mouse\nto run on a treadmill than it is\nto get a mouse to lift weights.\nAlthough people have put\nlittle ankle weights on mice\nand the ways of getting\nmice to do resistance work\nis actually a little bit barbaric\n- Little stressful.\n- 'Cause oftentimes\nthey'll incapacitate a limb\nto overload another limb,\nso it's an asymmetric thing.\nIt's not the same as sending\nthem in to do squats,\nor deadlifts, or something.\nBut cardiovascular\nexercise might be special.\nAnd what are your thoughts on that?\nAnd please first, though,\ntell us your routine.\nYour routine is 30 to 45 minutes of,\nare you a Peloton cycler?\nDoes it matter?\n- I think that the data\nsuggests that as long\nas your heart rate is getting\nup for these long-term effects\non your hippocampus and prefrontal cortex,\nyou also get better at\nshifting and focusing\nyour attention, for that\nyou need cardiovascular.\nAnd what I use is a video\nworkout that I started\neven before the pandemic,\nit's called \"Daily Burn,\"\nand is just thousands\nof different workouts.\nBut I love they are 30 minutes\nthat I sometimes add on\na 10 to 15 minute stretch at\nthe beginning or at the end.\nBut I love the variety.\nSometimes I do it with weight.\nSometimes I do it without weights.\nI love kickboxing,\nso they have a lot of kickboxing in there.\nIt just fits my routine,\nand it's always there,\nand I don't have to get\nall dressed up to go\nto the gym to work out.\nSo that's what I do.\n- And that's a daily\nthing, seven days a week?\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- Seven days\na week, fantastic.\nSo in terms of he way\nthat some of these changes\nare being conveyed from\nthe body to the brain,\nthat fascinates me.\nI mean, as you and I know, and I'm sort of\na repeating record on the\npodcast always saying,\nyou got a brain but you\nalso have a spinal cord\nand then your nervous\nsystem connects everything.\nEvery organ in your body\nis basically signaled to\nby the nervous system and\nback to the nervous system,\nyou're explaining everything.\nBut so let's imagine your morning routine,\nyou do your cardiovascular exercise,\nso you're pumping more blood,\nthat's the definition\nof a higher heart rate,\nstroke volume of the\nheart goes up over time,\nyou're getting fitter, so blood flow\nto the brain is increasing.\nDo we know how that gets\ntranslated to a signal\nto release more BDNF?\nAnd then it raises this\nother question, which is,\ndoes it matter where your\nmind is when you exercise?\nBecause ultimately the brain, of course,\nyou can anchor your attention\nto the exercise or you can be\nlistening to a podcast or something else.\nI've always wondered about this.\nCan we enhance the effects\nof exercise by combining\nthe enhanced blood flow with\ncognitive work during exercise?\nOr is it simply a matter of\njust getting more blood flow\nup to the hippocampus?\n- Yeah, I wish I had the\nanswer to that question, too.\nMy instinct is, yes, it matters partially\nbecause of the work of\nyour colleague, Alia Crum,\non mindset and the power of that to change\nhow physiologically\nour body is responding.\nSo how could it not\nwork in her experiments\nor work in her experiments and not work\nfor my morning or our\nmorning exercise routine.\nBut are there studies, point to a study,\nI don't know of one.\nSo exercise neuroscientists out there,\nI'd love to see that study done.\nSo yes, it works.\nBefore I go into the aerobic thing,\nI always like to start with\nthe least amount of exercise\nto get something really useful,\nbecause I don't want people to say,\noh God, I hate sweating,\nI don't want to listen anymore.\nSo I always like to start\nwith studies have shown\nthat just 10 minutes of walking\noutside can shift your mood.\nThat is part of that\nneurochemical bubble bath\nthat you're getting dopamine,\nserotonin, noradrenaline\nand anybody can walk for 10 minutes.\nAnd so that is for all of\nyou thinking that out there,\nwhat is the minimum that I could get\nsome of these brain effects?\n10 minutes of walking, anybody can do it.\n- Now is outside important?\nI'm a big believer in getting\nphotons into the eyes.\n- I think that that study was\ndone indoors on a treadmill.\nAnd the comparison wasn't\ndone, but moving your,\nwhich is great, in the\nmiddle of the pandemic\nI walked around my apartment\nfor 30 minutes sometimes\njust for some variety,\nfelt like a rat on a\nrunning wheel, but yes.\nSo that minimum amount\nof movement in your body\ncan get you those mood effects.\nBut what about the big,\nfat, fluffy hippocampus?\nWhat about the better\nperforming prefrontal cortex?\nThat's where you start to\nneed the cardio workout.\nAnd from my reading of the literature,\nthere haven't been enough studies\ndirectly comparing and contrasting\nkickboxing with running,\nwith whatever other cardio\nthat you need to do,\nbut any cardio workout that is done\nhas these positive effects.\nSo I'm going to say my\ninterpretation of that is that\nwhatever way you get your heart rate up,\nincluding a power walk,\na power walk can get\nyour heart rate up, that is beneficial.\nAnd what is happening, there\nare two pathways that have been\nstudied about how you go from\nmoving your body to more BDNF,\nthat neurotrophin that's\nincreasing the growth\nof new hippocampal brain cells.\nThe two pathways are the following.\nOne is a myokine, which is a protein\nreleased by the muscles.\nAnd not your heart, these are\nstriated muscles in your body.\nAnd so by running, these\nwere studies done in rats\non running wheels, they\nshowed that the running rats\nhad more of this myokine,\nreleased the myokine past\nthe blood-brain barrier.\nso got into the rarefied,\nvery protected bloodstream\nof inside the brain, and that\nmyokine stimulated the release\nof BDNF in the brain,\nthat's pathway number one.\nPathway number two comes through the liver\nbecause exercise is a stress generally.\nHow do we know that,\nwell, cortisol is released\nwhenever we exercise.\nWe need that sugar in our blood\nand so that's how the\nphysiological mechanisms work.\nAnd so there is a ketone,\nbeta-hydroxybutyrate,\nthat we've known for a very\nlong time that gets released\nby the liver during exercise.\nAnd we also know that that\nparticular ketone passes\nthat blood-brain barrier.\nAnd it's another stimulant for BDNF.\nSo kind of the final\ncommon pathway seems to be\nBDNF stimulation in the hippocampus.\nIs it the only one, probably not,\nbut that's the one that has\nbeen studied most clearly.\nSo it comes from all of\nour physiological systems,\nour muscles working, our\nliver responding to the stress\nof exercise, and what is it doing,\nit is giving more BDNF\nprecursors to get into our brain,\nto cause the upspike\nof BDNF, which is part\nof your bubble bath that you're\ngetting every time you move.\n- I love that description\nof a factor from muscle\nand a factor from liver,\nbecause anytime we're thinking\nabout movement of the\nbody and translating that\nto the brain, as you\nso clearly pointed out,\nthat needs to traverse\nthe blood-brain barrier.\nNot everything that happens in the body\nis communicated to the brain\nand these seem like\nreally important signals.\nBeta-hydroxybutyrate, you\nmentioned is a ketone,\nI just want to underscore\nthat doesn't mean, folks,\nthat you need to be on a ketogenic diet.\nI think people hear ketone and they think,\nI know some people are, most\npeople are not, I imagine.\nThere are ketones that\nare released in your brain\nand body that can function,\neven if you're ingesting\ncarbohydrates and not ketogenic,\njust for a point of clarification.\nThis issue of new neurons\nis one that you hear a lot,\nyou know, neurogenesis,\nyou're going to grow\nnew neurons, new neurons.\nAnd my understanding is\nthat the rodent literature\nis very clear that animals\nthat run on wheels more often,\nit turns out rodents\nlove to run on wheels.\nDo you know these\nstudies by Hoppy Holster,\nwhich are pretty funny,\nthey're very cool, by the way, Hoppy,\nHoward Hughes investigator,\nI'm not making light of them.\nThey put running wheels in\na field and wild rodents\nwill run to the running wheel\nand run on that running wheel.\n- Oh, that's great.\n- They really enjoy it.\nWhich I find amusing for\nreasons that probably\nonly a neuroscientist would find amusing.\nIn any case, in rodents,\nit seems that running more\non a wheel can trigger neurogenesis,\nliterally the birth of new\nneurons and the addition\nof new neurons to the hippocampus.\nIn monkeys, this has been controversial.\nIt seems it does happen in the hippocampus\nand in the olfactory bulb,\nprobably not in the neocortex.\nThinking back to the\ndecades or more controversy\nbetween Liz Gould and Pasko Rakic.\nI hope they settled\ntheir differences there.\nNeuroscientists love to argue.\nIt's kind of what we do.\nAnd in humans, I think it's\nbeen a bit controversial.\nSome people say absolutely, yes.\nOther people say absolutely no,\nthere are new neurons\nadded to the adult brain.\nI haven't followed that\nliterature down to the detail.\nBut I do remember one study\nthat I don't think is contested,\nwhich is the work of Rusty\nGage at the Salk Institute\nwhere they actually injected\na sort of due type marker\ninto the brains of terminally ill humans\nwho very graciously offered\nto have their brains removed\nand dissected after death.\nAnd in some cases, these very\nold terminally ill humans,\nthey did see evidence for new neurons\nbeing born in the hippocampus.\nCan I trust that idea still?\nIs that generally accepted?\n- Well, so after that study,\nwhich was quite a while ago,\nthere are more recent\nstudies, still controversial,\nbut showing and\ndemonstrating, using even new\nand better techniques than were used\nin that original Rusty Gage study,\nwhich was groundbreaking\nat the time, that suggest,\nand I think show, that\nthere are new neurons born\nin adult human brains into\nthe ninth decade of life.\nSo they not only did this, I think\nthose patients were in their\n60s, then they died of cancer.\nBut these new studies\nlooking across the timeline,\ncan we see, because the\nother thing was, yeah,\nmaybe you have some when you're 20,\nbut by the time you're\nolder and you might need\nthese new neurons, you\nhave no new neuron growth.\nAnd so these studies seem to\nsuggest that, yes, yes you do.\nAnd we all do even into old age.\n- Great, and I'll just\ntake a moment to say\nthat I am personally\nnot aware of any studies\nlooking at other forms of exercise\nbesides cardiovascular exercise\nfor sake of brain health.\nAnd this, I think, is an\nimportant gap in the literature\nthat ought to be filled,\nwhether or not for instance,\nhigh intensity interval training,\nor whether or not weight training,\nwhich has other effects\non the musculature,\nso you can imagine perhaps\nthe myokine to BDNF pathway,\nthe pathway one that you\nmentioned, might be signaled,\nbut maybe not the liver pathway, maybe.\nYes, I'm speculating here.\nThose studies need to be done.\nTo my knowledge, they just\nhaven't been done yet.\nBut they should be done.\nIf you would, could you tell us about\nsome of the more specific\neffects of exercise on memory?\nMemory is a broad category\nof effects and phenomena.\nSo things like what comes to mind is\nshort-term, medium- and long-term memory,\nreaction time, learning\nmath, at least for me,\nis quite a bit different\nthan learning history,\nalthough there's certainly overlap\nin the neural underpinnings.\nWhat has been demonstrated\nin the laboratory\nin animal models, but\nespecially in humans,\nand if you want to share\nwith us any results\nfrom your lab, published or unpublished,\nI'm sure that the audience\nwould be delighted\nto learn about them.\n- Absolutely, let me start with kind of\nthe immediate effects, acute\neffects as they're called,\nof exercise on the brain.\nSo this is asking what does\na one-off exercise session\ndo for your brain?\nAnd there, there are three major effects\nthat have been reproduced.\nI've seen it in my lab, many\nlabs have reproduced this.\nSo what do you get with the one-off?\nThis is usually an\naerobic-type exercise session,\n30 to 45 minutes.\nWhat you get is that mood\nboost, very, very consistent.\nYou get improved prefrontal function,\ntypically tested with a Stroop test,\nwhich is a test that asks\nyou to shift and focus\nyour attention in specific ways.\nIt's a challenging task\nand clearly dependent\non the prefrontal cortex largely.\nAnd significant improvements\nin reaction time,\nso your speed at responding,\noften a motor kind of,\nbut cognitive motor response is improved.\nOver the pandemic, one of the\nunpublished studies that I did\nlooking at the effects of 30 minutes\nof age-appropriate workout in subjects\nranging in age from their 20s\nall the way up to their 90s.\nSo what are the things that\nI saw more consistently?\nIrrespective of your age,\neverybody got a decreased anxiety\nand depression and hostility\nscore, which is very important.\nSo it's not just decreasing\nyour anxiety and depression\nbut decreasing your hostility levels.\n- Making the world a better place.\n- Making the world a better place.\nEnergy, the feeling of energy went up.\nAnd what we found is in\nthe older population,\neven more than in the younger population,\nwe saw improved performance on both Stroop\nand Eriksen flanker task,\nwhich is another task dependent\non really focusing in on different letters\nand paying attention to\nwhat letter is being shown.\nSo these are consistent effects.\nHow long do they last?\nOne of the studies that I did\npublish in my lab showed that\nthe immediate effects of\nexercise lasted up to two hours.\nUnfortunately, that was\nthe longest that we last,\nthey were still there at two hours.\nSo that's a pretty big bang for your buck.\n- That is.\n- One 30 minute.\n- Sorry to interrupt, I just\nwant to make sure I understand.\nSo when you say the effects\nlasted up to two hours,\ndoes that mean up to two hours\nafter you finished exercise?\nOr up to two hours of\nmemory challenging work?\nJust to be clear.\n- Yeah, that's a great question.\nSo my study looked at two hours\nafter you finish your workout\nwe gave you these cognitive tests.\nDuring that two-hour period,\nyou were free to do anything\nexcept exercise or eat.\nAnd so there was no extra load on people.\nBut two hours later, you\ndid do significantly better\non these focused attention\ntasks compared to a group\nthat watched videos for\nthe exercise period.\nThis was an hour of cycling that they did.\nThese were young subjects in their 20s.\n- Okay, so if I finish\nmy exercise at 9:00 AM,\neven if I start this cognitive\nwork, this mental work at 11,\nI'll still see benefits.\n- Yes, at least by 11,\nbecause I didn't go\nfarther than two hours.\nSo it could last even longer than that,\nbut I have evidence that\nit lasts for two hours.\n- And perhaps if I had\nstarted the cognitive work\n45 minutes after my exercise ended,\nit would also be helpful.\n- Yes.\n- So there's no reason\nto think that there's a,\nthat you have to wait before\nstarting cognitive work.\n- Yeah, no reason at all.\n- I'm asking questions\nof the sort that I get\nin the comments, that we are going to get\nin the comment section.\nWe always strive for clarity here.\nSo what this tells me is that\nexercising early in the day\nmay have a special effect.\nI realize that some people cannot exercise\nuntil later in the evening,\nbut you mentioned something\nearlier that I want\nto cue people to, it's\nvery, very important.\nI don't think I've ever\nmentioned this on the podcast,\nwhich is any kind of physical\nactivity will increase\ncortisol to varying degrees.\nAnd so sometimes it's a healthy increase,\nsometimes it's an unhealthy increase.\nIf you do two hours of\nreally intense exercise\nand you're not prepared for it,\nthat's a big spike in cortisol,\nprobably not a good thing\nfor most people.\nBut if you are going to\ndo your cardiovascular\nor weight training later in the day,\nthat increase in cortisol can promote\ntoo much wakefulness for sleep, etc.\nShifting that cortisol\nspike early in the day\nis associated with a\nnumber of important things\nrelated to mood, etc.\nBut more and more, what\nI'm thinking and hearing\nis that exercise early in the day is key.\nOur former dean of the\nmedical school, Phil Pizzo,\nwas and is kind of\nfamous still for jogging\nbetween the hours of, like, 4 and 5:00 AM,\nor five and six, and then\nrunning the medical school.\nAnd you're up early doing your\nexercise, and cold shower,\nand meditation, we'll\ntalk about meditation,\nbut this is more and more\nof a push, I feel like,\nor a stimulus for us to think about moving\nour exercise earlier in the day.\n- Yeah, I mean, I like to say that,\nI know there are moms and dads\nout there and they just say,\nlook, I have a kid, the\nkid's more important\nthan my doing my exercise.\nSo you will get benefits if\nyou do it whenever you can.\nSo that's great, more power to you.\nBut what all the neuroscience\ndata suggests is the best time\nto do your exercise is\nright before you need\nto use your brain in\nthe most important way\nthat you need to use it every day.\nAnd so that is why the morning\nfor most of us is beneficial.\nThat's why I do it in the morning\nand I'm lucky enough\nto be able to do that.\nBut yeah, it makes sense with all,\neverything we know about how this works\nand how it benefits our brain.\n- I think about our\ncolleague, Eric Kandel,\nwho not incidentally has a\nNobel Prize and studies memory.\nAnd rumor has it that he's been a swimmer\nfor a lot of years.\nThat he'll put in, I think\nnowadays he's in his '90s,\nnow he'll put in half a mile,\nbut he used to do swim a mile a day\nor something of that sort.\n- Wow, I heard that, too,\nthat he was a swimmer\nand he does it very, very religiously.\n- Okay, so there are a\nfew other neuroscientists\nthat do that, I can think\nof a lot of neuroscientists\nthat probably should exercise more.\nAnd I don't say that to poke at them,\nI just would love to see them\ndoing their incredible work\nfor many more decades.\nAnd everything that we're\ntalking about today indicates\nthat if one doesn't, unless\nyou have incredible genetics,\nwe all experience\nage-related dementia, right.\nI mean, the story of your\nfather is a salient one.\nAnd we should remember\nthat as we go forward.\nI also want to emphasize, and\nI'd love to get your thoughts\non just memory and memory loss in general.\nIt seems we all get worse at remembering\nand learning things, even\nif we don't get Alzheimer's.\nWhen does that typically start for humans?\n- You know, I think there's\nso much variability,\nnot only because we are individuals,\nbut because our stress\nlevels are different\nand, well, everybody's\nanxiety level has gone up\nin the last couple of years,\nbut that also has an effect.\nWe don't remember as much\nin a highly stressful,\nhighly anxious situation.\nSo, as you know, it's hard\nto answer that question.\nPeople say, okay, just tell me\nhow much exercise I have to do.\n- 30 to 45 minutes a day.\nBut I love that per day,\nI've been doing this whole\nthing of telling people, oh,\nthe data say 150 to 200\nminutes of zone two cardio,\nwhich is kind of moderately hard\nbut not excessively hard, but\nI love this everyday theme.\nBecause whenever I do that,\nthe questions that come back\nare, well, what if I take a\nlong hike on the weekends?\nAnd so people start negotiating.\nThere's something that's very powerful\nabout non-negotiable, everyday.\nSun in your eyes every day\neven through cloud cover.\nExercise for 30 to 45 minutes.\nCold shower every day.\n- Every day, yeah.\n- My understanding of the\nliterature is that somewhere\nin our 50s or 60s, we start noticing\nlittle hiccups in memory,\nfor some people younger,\nfor some people later.\nBut I have to imagine\nthat doing the exercise\nthroughout one's entire\nlife is going to help\noffset some of this\nsimply 'cause of the BDNF\nand other downstream effects.\n- Yeah, I mean, that's what it suggests.\nOne of my favorite studies,\nand then I want to get back to you wanted,\nyou invited me to share\nsome of my unpublished data\non the effects of long-term exercise,\nbut first I want to share\none of my favorite studies,\nwhich is a longitudinal\nstudy done in Swedish women.\nAnd this was published in 2018.\nAnd what they did was back in the 1960s,\nthey found Swedish women,\n300 Swedish women in their 40s.\nAnd they characterized them\nas low fit, mid fit, high fit.\nOkay, and then 40 years later,\nthey came back and found these women,\nthey let them do, live their lives.\nAnd they asked what happened\nto these women as a function\nof whether they were low fit, mid fit,\nhigh fit in their 40s,\nthey're now in their 80s.\nAnd what they found was\nthat relative to the low fit\nor mid fit women, the\nwomen that were high fit\ngained nine more years of\ngood cognition later in life.\nNow this is not a\nrandomized controlled study.\nThis is a correlational study.\nBut does it agree with everything\nthat we've been talking about today?\nYes, does it agree with\nthis idea that the women\nthat were high fit were\ngiving their brains\nthis bubble bath, maybe not every day,\nbut very, very regularly\nfor that entire 40 years\nand that built up their big,\nfat, beautiful hippocampi?\nYes, it does.\nSo that's one of my favorite studies.\n- Yeah, another cause for getting\nthe exercise in consistently.\nI am impressed by this 10-minute walk\nand the improvements in mood\nfrom just a 10-minute walk.\nBut again, I think that\ndaily repetition also\nI have to imagine has\neffects on the very pathways\nthat allow plasticity.\nThis is something we, in the\nrealm of neuroplasticity,\nwe don't often hear about or think about,\neven as a neuroscientist,\nwhich is that the pathways\nfor engaging plasticity probably can be,\nprobably I'm speculating\nhere, can be made better\nby engaging in the sorts of behavior\nthat stimulate plasticity.\nIn other words, if one gets\nbetter at calming themselves\ndown under stress, those circuits\nget better at doing that.\n- Yes, absolutely.\n- Neural circuits\ngain proficiency.\nAnd so, because blood vessels can grow,\ncapillaries can grow in the brain,\nyou can imagine that more\npumping of blood to the brain,\ndelivery of these various\nmuscle and liver factors\nwould also establish larger\nor more efficient portals\nto getting that stuff there.\nSo you could imagine kind\nof an amplifying effect\nof exercise, and again,\nI'm speculating here,\nbut I've seen this over and\nover again in colleagues,\nthe ones who exercise consistently\nseem to be really, really\nsmart and doing amazing work\nwell into their 80s and 90s\nand the ones who aren't, some of whom\nactually pride themselves\non how little they exercise,\nthey get worse over time.\nYou see them each meeting,\neach decade and I'm not poking\nfun at them at all, it's actually\nquite, quite hard to see.\nAnd they're kind of a fading light,\nthey're starting to flicker.\nSo there is this incredible relationship\nbetween body vitality and brain vitality.\nThat, of course, is not\nan excuse for spending\nall day in the gym.\nThe gym rats, I enjoy working\nout so I could imagine\ndoing that, but that\ndoesn't make us smarter,\nunfortunately you actually have to do\nthe cognitive work also,\nit's not just exercise.\nSo I'd love to hear about some of these\nnew unpublished data.\n- Yeah, okay, so when I\njumped into the exercise work,\neverybody was studying people 65 or older\nbecause that's when\ncognitive decline begins.\nAnd if the idea is exercise can help you\nwith your cognition, then makes sense.\nHowever, I thought, well,\nyou know that it's great,\nthere's lots of work there.\nI wanted to know what happens\nin people in their 40s\nand their 50s, maybe even\ntheir 30s and their 20s.\nWhy, because that's when\nwe, as humans are able,\nready, willing, and able\nto increase our exercise\nand gets us set up to build our brains\nas we go into our 60s.\nAnd so the first study\nthat I did looked at\nlow fit participants from\ntheir 30s to mid 50s,\nand we wanted to ask this question,\nhow much exercise do you really need\nto start seeing benefits?\nDo you see benefits?\nOr maybe you have to wait\nuntil you start seeing\ncognitive decline to get benefits.\nThat was one of the theories out there.\nAnd so that's what I wanted to do.\nAnd so what we did was three\nmonths of two to three times\na week cardio, it was a spin class,\nso spin classes are great for cardio.\nAnd the comparison group was\ntwo to three times a week\nof competitive video Scrabble.\nSo no heart rate change, but\nthey had to come into my lab\nand be in a group just\nlike they were in a group\nfor the spin class.\nWe touched them cognitively\nat the beginning\nand the end of the session.\nWhat we found was two to\nthree times a week of cardio\nin these people, they are low\nfit, which means specifically\nthat they were exercising\nless than 30 minutes a week\nfor the three months\nprevious to the experiment.\nSo they went from that to\ntwo to three times a week\nof spin class and what\nwe found was changes\nin baseline rates of their\npositive mood states went up\nrelative to the video Scrabble group.\nTheir body image got more positive\nbecause they were\nexercising, which is great.\nAnd really important, their\nmotivation to exercise went up\nsignificantly compared to\nthe video Scrabble group,\nwhich is great.\nSo the more you exercise,\nthe more motivated\nyou are to exercise.\nWhat about cognition?\nWhat changed in the cognitive\ncircuits of their brain?\nNumber one, we got improved\nperformance on the Stroop task,\nbut we're headed towards\nmy favorite structure,\nwhich is the hippocampus.\nWhat we found was improved\nperformance on both\na recognition memory\ntask, which was a memory\nand coding task, and that\nis, can you differentiate\nsimilar items that we're\nasking you to remember,\nand a spatial episodic memory task,\nwhere we had them play one\nof those Doom like games\nwhen they went into this\nspatial maze and they had\nto do things in a virtual city.\nTheir performance there got better,\nwhich is very, very classically dependent\non the hippocampus.\nSo this, it was so\nsatisfying to do this study\nbecause I've been wanting\nto answer this question,\nwhat is a minimum amount or\ndoable amount of exercise\nthat will get you these\ncognitive benefits?\nAnd now I can say in 30-to-50-year\nolds that are low fit,\ntwo to three times a week.\nIs that doable, absolutely.\nWill it be hard if you're low fit, yeah,\nit's going to be challenging,\nbut absolutely doable.\nAnd so it makes sense\nwith all of the mechanisms\nthat we are, I didn't study the\nmechanisms just to be clear,\nbut with all the mechanisms\nwe are imagining are playing\na role here, that absolutely\nmakes sense and it is doable.\nThis is not like you have\nto become marathon runner\nto get any of these benefits.\nThis is you have to start moving your body\non a regular basis two\nto three times a week.\nSo I love that for its realness.\n- How long are those sessions again?\n- 45 Minutes.\n- 45 Minutes.\n- Yeah, 45 minutes, it's a\ntypical spin kind of class.\nThere's a warmup for five\nminutes and a cool down\nfor five minutes, so\nit's really 35 minutes\nof they're really pushing you.\n- And so they're\nbreathing reasonably hard.\nHeart rate is up.\n- Heart rate is up definitely up, yeah\n- I find that all of those\nresults are really interesting\nthat the results showing\nimprovement in motivation\nto exercise is interesting,\n'cause it gets back\nto this issue of kind of\na self-amplifying effect.\nAnd the neuroscientist\nin me wants to think\nabout kind of pre-motor\ncircuits and the fact that\nwe have a motor system that\ncan obviously do things\nlike lift cups, and walk, and\nrun if we want to or need to,\nbut that it's possible to create\na kind of anticipatory\nactivity in our nervous system\nwhere our body craves a certain stimulus,\nyou mentioned the cold and\nhow you crave the cold.\nNow whether or not that's the adrenaline,\nand the dopamine, etc.,\nor whether or not somebody\nwho exercises, going from\nzero, less than 30 minutes\nper week to two to three\ntimes a week, 45 minutes,\nas you described for this study.\nI've had that experience\nbefore of that the cardio,\nthat I tend to battle the most,\nI love lifting heavy objects,\nat least heavy for me.\nI'm happy to go to the gym every other day\nand just lift heavy objects for an hour.\nIt just makes me happy,\nI like the way it feels,\nand I've been doing it since I\nwas in my teens, so 30 years.\nCardio's a little bit trickier.\nI like to run, but if I stop\nrunning for a little while\nI find it very hard to get back into.\nBut if I start running three times a week\nfor 30 to 45 minutes and I\ndo this pretty consistently\non the days I don't weight train,\nI find that I start to crave it.\nIt's almost as if my body\nneeds that in order to,\nI always say, clear out the cobwebs,\nbut it's like my mind\ndoesn't function as well,\nclearly now I understand\nwhy and why exercise helps,\nbut also physically I almost\nfeel like my body needs\nto engage in that movement.\nLike the pre-motor circuits\nare kind of revving,\nkind of like revving then engine\non a car while it's in park.\nSo the motivation to exercise obviously\ncould be multifaceted.\nIt could be purely psychological,\nbut do you think there's any\nreason to speculate at least\nor believe that we can\nbuild an anticipatory,\nreverbatory activity\ninto our nervous system?\n- Yeah, yeah,\nI agree with that because I\nalso have those same kinds\nof thoughts and I do have\nanticipatory exercise\nwhen I can't do it.\nSo I just got back from a\nweek and a half in Paris,\nwhere I got to do a book launch\nof my last book, \"Good Anxiety.\"\nAnd I really walked around a lot,\nbut I did not do my exercise\nfor that whole week and a half.\nBut there was a lot of\nstress 'cause I had to do\nall these interviews in French.\nSo I gave myself a break.\n- You speak French?\n- I speak French.\n- I was going to say, otherwise\nit would be really stressful.\n- That would be really stressful.\n- Then I'd be really impressed.\nThen I would definitely start exercising.\nActually, I would follow\nyour morning routine to a T,\nbut okay, very impressive nonetheless.\n- But I got back and coming\nback this direction from Paris,\nI live in New York, is much easier.\nAnd so I was able to get up\nat a normal time the next day.\nAnd that exercise session\nthat first day is like, okay,\nI'm back in my home, I'm\nback in my environment.\nAnd it felt so good.\nIt was like I wanted to come back.\nAnd I know it's because\nI worked up over years,\nnow I could truthfully\nsay seven days a week,\nbut it was first it was four to five,\nthen it was five to six, and yeah, seven,\nbut that includes a yoga day,\nor sometimes I have to\ndo it for 10 minutes\ninstead of 30 because I have to leave.\nBut that habit of you do\nthat even for five minutes,\nyou do either the weight 10-minute thing,\nor a five-minute thing, or a\nstretch, that is a tiny habit.\nIs that somebody at Stanford\nthat invented this idea\nof tiny habits, I thought it was?\n- Well, we've got a\nnumber of people there.\nAnd I apologize in\nadvance to all the people\nI neglect in this statement, but I'm happy\nto put it in the comments, folks.\nBJ Fogg is there, has done--\n- Yes, that's who I,\n- BJ's done really great work.\nAnd then James Clear\nwrote a book about habits\nand has a very popular\nnewsletter about habits.\nWe've done an episode\nabout habits that covers\nsome of their work and some\nof the more laboratory-ish,\nnot ish, laboratory science,\npeer-reviewed work on it.\nDaily behaviors, also\ndaily behaviors performed\nat roughly the same time of day.\nI mean, one thing we know for sure is that\nthe circadian system is part\nof our nervous system's way\nof anticipating when things will happen,\nnot just what will happen.\nI'm telling you things you\nobviously know already,\nbut for the audience.\nPerforming your exercise at\nroughly the same time each day\nwill make it easier as\nopposed to just saying,\nI'm going to do it seven\ndays a week sometime today.\nBut of course, getting it\ndone sometime is better\nthan not getting it done.\n- Yes, absolutely, absolutely.\n- Well, those are impressive\neffects and I love that\nyou're starting to look\nin populations that are\na bit younger, not because\nsome of these older populations\naren't important, but I think\nthat building good habits in\nacross one's entire life\nis really what it's about.\nAs I always say with\nanything related to longevity\nor offsetting an age-related\ndecline, we don't know,\nit's hard to know if things work\nbecause there's no within subject control.\nBut what we also know for\nsure is that you don't want\nto be the control experiment.\n- Exactly.\n- You absolutely don't\nwant to be the control experiment,\nespecially for something\nthat's purely behavioral.\nI mean, you're not talking about ingesting\na particular supplement.\nYou're not talking about\nchanging your diet in any way.\nBut I am curious diet is\na very barbed wire topic\non the internet, which diets\nwhether or not they work, etc.,\nbut in general, in any of these studies,\ndo they evaluate whether\nor not people change\ntheir eating habits when\nthey start to exercise more?\n- Yeah, I think I've seen\none study that controlled\nfor that, but I feel for\nthem because it's hard enough\nto get people to exercise at\nthe level and at the time,\nthat you need for your study.\nIf you also ask them, okay,\nfill out this survey to\ntell us exactly what you ate\nall day, they're going to say, forget you,\nI'm not joining your study.\nSo it's a critical question.\nAnd again, there's only\nbeen one that I've seen\nand the evidence was that diets got better\nwhen they, you know, less processed foods,\nwhen they did adhere to this exercise.\nBut lot more information needs\nto be gathered in that realm.\nThe second study that I\nwanted to share unpublished,\nwe're writing it up right\nnow, is part two of that study\nthat I just described, which\nwas the low fit people.\nNext we move to mid fit\npeople, like what about us,\nwe're already exercising,\nam I going to benefit from\nincreasing my exercise?\nSo here again we collaborated\nwith a great spin studio\nthat had a whole bunch of mid fit people\nthat by our definition were\nexercising two to three times\na week on a regular basis.\nThat's great, all you people\nout there that are doing that,\nyou should know you're\nalready benefiting your brain.\nBut our question was what if\nwe invited them to exercise\nas much as they wanted at the\nspin studio for three months,\nfrom two to three times all the way\nup to seven times a week, and\nlet's just see what happened.\nAnd the control group, we asked them\nnot to change their exercise.\nAnd so what we ended up\nwith was a nice big array\nof starting with mid\nfit people that exercise\nbetween staying at two\nto three times a week,\nall the way up to seven times a week.\nAnd the bottom line from that study\nis every drop of sweat counted.\nThat is, the more you change\nand you increase your workout\nup to seven times a week,\nthe better your mood was,\nyou had lower amounts\nof depression and anxiety,\nhigher amounts of good effect,\nand the better your hippocampal memory was\nwith the more you worked out,\nagain, this was for three months.\nSo I love that too, because it gives power\nto those of us that are regularly\nexercising and wondering,\ndo I really need to?\nI mean, is it really going to help me?\nAnd the answer is yes.\nI mean, not all of us can exercise,\ngo to a spin class seven times a week,\nbut I love the message that\nour body is responsive to that.\nAnd you can get better\nhippocampal function,\nbetter overall baseline mood affect\nwith a higher level.\nSo it works for the\nmid fit people as well.\n- Fantastic, the more I learn from you,\nthe more I'm starting to\nconceptualize the brain as an organ\nthat is privileged in so many ways,\nhas this unique blood-brain barrier,\nhas this incredible quality of\nbeing able to predict things,\nand it's job mainly is, of\ncourse, to predict things\namong other functions, of course,\nbut that our brain isn't\nnecessarily going to stay stable\nor get better over time,\nthat it needs a signal.\nIt isn't sufficient to just\nsay that we can't take it\nfor granted, that our\nbrain is actually an organ\nthat requires a signal\nin order to maintain\nits own function and it sounds\nlike enhanced blood flow\nand these pathways that\nyou described earlier,\nthese two pathways are at least among\nthe more critical signals.\nI'm tempted now to move my frequency\nof cardiovascular exercise from,\nI confess it's about three\ndays, 35 minutes lately,\nand it should be more to daily.\nThere's something really, again,\nreally special about daily\nbecause it's nonnegotiable,\nyou just do it.\nAnd it sounds like if one were to do\nhigher intensity exercise,\nyou know in a spin class,\nI've never taken a spin\nclass, but I've seen\nthere are times when they're\nstanding up on the bike\nand pedaling very hard.\nSo that is included in these\nkinds of workouts, right?\n- Absolutely, yeah.\n- Okay.\n- I mean, that's what\nthe instructor is doing.\nI cannot control.\nWe did monitor heart rate of\nall the subjects and it was\nclearly, compared to the video Scrabble,\nit was highly significant.\n- I would hope so.\n- Yes.\n- I guess it depends on how intense\nthat game of Scrabble is.\nCould we just briefly talk\nabout mindset and affirmations?\n- Yeah, sure.\n- You've talked\na bit before about affirmations,\nand as you mentioned, the\nbeautiful work of my colleague\nat Stanford, Alia Crum,\nwe can summarize her work pretty simply,\nalthough we won't do it\ncomplete justice by it,\nshe's already been on the podcast,\njust to say that one's\nbeliefs about a behavior\nalso impact the outcomes of that behavior.\nIf you learn a lot of true\nfacts about stress being good\nfor you, then you'll experience\nstress as better for you\nthen if you only focus on or learn about\nthe negative effects of stress.\nIf you learn about the\npositive effects of exercise,\nyou actually derive greater\nbenefit from exercise,\nbelieve it or not.\nIt's incredible, incredible effects,\nbut they make sense when you understand\nwhat the brain is doing,\nwhich is a lot of this\npredictive coding and mindsets\ndon't seem as mysterious and woo anymore\nonce you understand what\nthe brain is really doing.\nBut what is, if any,\nthe value of affirmation\nof telling yourself\nsomething positive about yourself,\nor of exercise, on not\nthe exercise itself,\nbut on mood, self image,\nmemory, and brain function?\n- Yeah, so, I looked into\nthis because I am also\na certified exercise instructor\nand the form of exercise\nthat I teach is called IntenSati.\nIt's a form of exercise that was developed\nby this amazing instructor,\nPatricia Moreno.\nAnd she combined physical\nmovements from kickbox,\nand dance, and yoga, and martial arts\nwith positive spoken affirmations.\nSo each move, if you're\npunching back and forth,\nas you would do in a kickbox class,\nyou don't just punch,\nyou say something like\nI am strong now, which every punch\nis associated with a word.\nAnd you know, you can create\nyour own series of affirmations\nwith the moves that you put together.\nAnd the first time I did it, I\njust wandered into her class,\nI didn't know what it\nwas and I felt idiotic,\nI was like what, I came\ninto the wrong class,\nI don't want to come into this class.\nBut then I saw they didn't\ncare whether I thought\nthey looked silly saying these affir-,\nnot saying, yelling these\naffirmations out loud\nwhile doing the choreography\nat the same time.\nAnd then I tried it,\nokay, I didn't yell out,\nI kind of whispered it at first.\nBut by the end, I was\nreally yelling it out.\nThere's something about the declaration,\nusing your own voice of saying things that\nyou don't often say to\nyourself, like I'm strong,\nI'm inspired, I believe I will succeed,\nare all the kinds of affirmations you say.\nAnd you walk out of that class,\nor I walked out of that class,\nthinking, ah, I feel really good now.\nMan, I can't wait to\ncome back to this class.\nWhich is why I ultimately\ntook teacher training\nto be able to teach that class.\nAnd so I started to\nlook into what was known\nabout affirmations and\nthey were never combined\nwith physical activity, but\nit was clear that there was\na literature showing that\npositive affirmations,\nsaying them or reading\nthem could change mood\nin the same way as we're talking about,\nyou know, Alia Crum's work.\nIf you have this, it's a belief,\nonce you start saying these things,\nthese are not difficult things to believe,\nbut it's amazing how much you don't say\nthese kinds of things to\nyourself or with your own voice.\nYou might say them about somebody else,\noh, you're strong, you're so smart.\nDo you say that about yourself?\nAnd that's the thing about\nthe self affirmations.\nIt really gets you into a habit\nof saying good things about yourself.\nAnd then you start to realize,\noh my God, I'm so mean to myself.\nI have lots of negative thoughts going on\nabout myself in my head, and which is part\nof the other reason why I loved this,\nthis particular form of exercise.\nSo what you get in\nIntenSati is the mood boost\nfrom the positive spoken affirmations\ntogether with all the other\nbrain and affect boosts\nthat we've been talking\nabout for this whole podcast,\nfrom the exercise, because\nit's a sweaty workout as well.\n- Interesting, there's a book,\nI confess I haven't read it,\nbut I have had the pleasure\nof having a discussion\nwith a psychologist from,\nI believe he's at University\nof Michigan in Ann Arbor,\nEthan Kross wrote a book called \"Chatter,\"\nwhich focuses on the fact that so much\nof our inner dialogue,\nit is indeed negative.\nHe certainly wasn't the\nfirst to point that out.\nBut that explicit statements to counter\nthat negative chatter, I\nbelieve is one of the hallmarks\nof readjusting one's own, not\njust internal reference frame,\nbut actually self-image generally.\nAnd it's a fascinating and, I\nthink, a very important area\nof psychology and neuroscience because,\nand I acknowledge this,\nwe're talking about this,\ntwo laboratory neuroscientists\nwho record from neurons\nand label neurons and look\nat stuff down the microscope,\nwe are now deep in the\nterritory, in the deep water\nof what some of our colleagues\nand people who think\nabout neuroscience would\nconsider really out there\non the kind of subjective edges.\nAnd yet I think it's worth pointing out\nthat the brain does all these things.\nIt's responsible for simple\nreflexes and motor behaviors,\nbut also high-level conceptual\nideas about the universe\nand what it might look like in 10 years,\nor 100 years, or 1,000 years,\nbut also high-level\nconceptual understanding\nof who we are and what we are about.\nAnd so even though it\nmight seem a little bit\nout on the fringes, dare I say,\nI think that these are\nsome of the more important\nuntread landscapes of neuroscience.\nAnd I just want to\nacknowledge my appreciation\nfor the fact that I'm going to\nconnect the dots here and say,\nyou went from somebody\nwho didn't exercise,\nwho went on this rafting trip,\nThat discovered exercise and its benefits\nfor your grant writing\nand then on and on and on,\nand then became a certified\n- Exercise instructor.\n- Instructor.\nSo you don't do anything\nhalfway, either as it's clear.\nI'd like to touch on something\nyou mentioned earlier,\nbut we haven't dove into\nit all in any depth,\nwhich is meditation.\nYou mentioned this tea meditation.\nYou had a publication recently\non a 10-minute meditation.\n- Yes.\n- Right?\nMaybe you could tell us about\nthis 10-minute meditation\nbecause it seems like such\nat tractable amount of time.\nAnd then if you would\nmaybe tell us a little bit\nabout the tea meditation.\nBut sounds like you've\ndiscovered a minimum,\na close to minimum threshold of meditation\nthat can really benefit us.\nSo maybe you could tell\nus about that study.\n- So the study was, as you\nvery astutely pointed out,\nvery practical study,\njust 10 minutes, not 30\nminutes, not an hour meditation,\nthat's too hard, 10\nminutes guided meditation.\nThey logged into a site.\nSo we can tell that they logged\nin and they listened to a,\nit's a body scan, very basic,\nbut easy to follow kind of meditation.\nAnd we asked them to do it, how often?\nDaily, seven days a week,\njust 10 minutes a day.\nAnd the most shocking thing\nabout this study is that\nwe got more adherence to the\n10 minute daily meditation\nthan the 10 minute\ndaily podcast listening,\nwhich was our control.\nSo the highest retention\nrate I've ever gotten in any,\nthis kind of study that I've\ndone, exercise or meditation,\nthey wanted to do it 10 minutes a day.\nIt was great.\n- I'm going to just\nstart leading meditations\nfor three hours as opposed to\ndoing a three-hour podcast.\n- So we looked at cognitive\neffects before and after this,\nit was eight weeks of daily,\nit was actually 12-minute meditation,\n12 minutes of body scan meditation.\nAnd what we found was\nsignificant decreases\nin stress response.\nSo we did the stress test\nto see how you responded\nto an unexpected, stressful situation.\nThe meditators did much better.\nTheir mood was better and\ntheir cognitive performance\nwas also better.\nAnd this was my first\nlittle foray into meditation\nafter I had started my\npersonal tea meditation,\nthat really shifted my\nrelationship with meditation.\nBut it is consistent with\nmany other studies showing\nthe beneficial effects of meditation.\nBut the unique thing was\nwe tried to make it doable\nthat many, many people out\nthere could actually follow\nthis typical regimen, and\nso we're continuing that.\nIn fact, my research in my\nlab right now is all about\nthose doable, short things\nthat NYU college students\nwill do, not just at the\nbeginning of the semester,\nbut at the end of the\nsemester when the stress\nand anxiety levels are now at\nrecord-breaking high levels.\nAnd they need something to\nbring that level down so that\nthey could show their professors\nwhat their brains can actually do.\nAnd so it includes very short meditations,\nsound meditations, visual\nmeditations, walking,\nthings that any college student,\nbut we're obviously focused\non NYU students, will do.\nI want to get at graduation rates.\nI want to get at class performance\nwith these kinds of interventions.\nBut it started with that study\nthat I just described, meditation.\n- If you would, and here's where we can\nhighlight this again, as some\nhighly educated speculation,\nif it's coming from you.\nWhat do you think is going\non during meditation?\nI mean, so a body skin involves\na kind of a interoceptive awareness,\nlike interoception, of\ncourse, being an attention\nto what's going on on the surface of\nand within the confines of our skin\nas opposed to the outside world.\nDrawing our attention to\nanything inside us or outside us\ninvolves forebrain function,\nprefrontal cortex presumably,\nand other things,\ntypically eyes are closed,\ntypically it's relaxing.\nSo there are a lot of\nvariables that could be feeding\ninto a number of different effects.\nBut as a neuroscientist,\nwhat do you think is going on\nthat this period of\nkind of an self-induced,\nsomewhat unusual state, what\ndo you think is going on\nin terms of network behavior\nand networks within the brain\nthat it can have these long-term effects?\nBecause we got to some\nof the ones downstream\nof exercise and I think\nthere's so much evidence,\nI know there's so much evidence\nthat meditation is beneficial.\nHow do you think it's working\nor what do you think it's doing?\n- Yeah, I think that one of\nthe most important things\nthat gets worked when we\nare doing a simple 10 minute\nor 12 minute body scan\nmeditation regularly,\nthis 10 minutes a day, 12 minutes a day\nis the habit building and\nthe practice of focusing\non the present moment.\nI think that is very hard\nfor us modern humans to do,\nbecause I'm worrying\nabout the thing that's due\nat the end of the week that I need to do\nand how many hours am I going\nto have to be able to do that.\nOr I'm worried about,\nwhatever, the email that wasn't\nas polite as it should be that I sent\nand what were the repercussions for that\ninstead of focusing on\nthis moment, which is fun,\nI get to talk to you, it's\na beautiful day outside,\nI'm feeling good right at this moment.\nAnd I think that those,\nall of the meditative\npractices that I've done,\nand this one also, whether\nyou know it or not,\nis getting you to focus on this moment.\nAnd I think it's even more\nimportant in this day and age\nwhere anxiety levels and the\nnext variant might come out\nand what are the repercussions there?\nAnd I have a mother who's older\nand she's more susceptible\nto it, and there's a war, and\nwhat's going to happen there?\nThose are all future possibilities.\nAnd we should be worried about that.\nThat is a possibility,\nyou need to plan for that.\nBut you also need to focus\non this moment right now.\nI'm healthy, I can breathe,\nI get to have this\ninteresting conversation\nright in this moment.\nIf I start thinking about other things,\nthen it takes away from this moment.\nDo I know what circuits are involved?\nNot exactly, that is not my area.\nI think there are some studies\nthat have focused on that,\nthat present moment kind of activity.\nBut that is what I think is most important\nabout the practice of meditation\nor one of the important\nthings that calms us down.\nBecause if you know how to do that,\nthat gives you this powerful\ntool for the rest of your day.\nYou're not locked into that\nfearful future thinking\nthat so many of us have,\nor that just reliving\nof the terrible past, but you could\nenjoy the present moment.\n- Yeah, that really resonates.\nI think that going back\nto the earlier part\nof our conversation,\nthe hippocampus has this\nincredible storage capacity\nand ability to set context\nabout past, present, and future.\nAnd that's a beautiful thing\nbecause as much as I like\nto think he had some\nsemblance of a healthy life,\nnone of us want to HM,\nnone of us want to be in the\nposition of not being able\nto form new memories and have no context\nto the past or the present.\nSo we're grateful that,\nwe should all be grateful\nthat our hippocampus can draw\nfrom past, present, and future\nin various combinations\nand we should support it\nthrough the daily\nexercise and other habits,\nlet's call them habits, so\nthat people make them habits\nnow that you've highlighted.\nBut if we are not deliberately\nanchoring within past,\npresent, and future\naccording to what we need,\nand we're just shuffling between\npast, present, and future,\nthat is not a good way to live.\n- No.\n- It's not effective.\n- No.\n- It sounds like meditation\ncan really help us go to the right stacks.\nI guess people don't go\nto libraries anymore,\nbut in the old days you would\ngo to the right location\nin the library, you actually\ncan't get distracted\nby the books that you're interested in,\nif you need to go just reflexively,\nif you need to go study\na particular topic.\nSo that's kind of how I think about it.\nIt makes us more linear\nperhaps in our way of being.\n- I think so, and it actually counteracts,\nnot that I'm against technology,\nbut having our phones and being connected\nto every good and bad thing\ngoing on in the world today\nis incredibly distracting\nand takes you away\nfrom the present moment\nvirtually 24 hours a day.\nAnd so we have to work extra\nhard right now compared to\nin the '40s when we didn't\nhave all this technology\nor at the same level.\nSo yeah, it becomes even\nmore important practice,\nI think, for everyday life.\n- Yeah, or even 10, 15 years ago\nit felt like smartphones\nweren't as intrusive.\nOne final question and maybe a request.\nAs the new incoming dean of\nCollege of Letters and Sciences,\nand I must say I'm delighted,\nthrilled actually to hear\nthat a lot of the practices\nthat we've been discussing today\nand that you've pioneered\nare going to be incorporated\ninto undergraduate education.\nI predict, and I'd be willing\nto wager that that will become\na template for how universities\nand non-university systems\nshould function because if\nindeed the, and it is true,\nthat there's this incredible relationship\nbetween physical movement and\nmental deliberate practices\nand performance, any\ncorporation, school, household\nwould be crazy, would be self-limiting,\nand even self-destructive\nto not incorporate those.\nSo I'm so happy that you're going\nto do this and collect data.\nPlease, we'll have to touch back with you\nand hear what comes to that.\nBut one of the main things\nthat I hear so much about today\nare issues with attention.\nAnd we haven't talked about attention,\nwe've mainly been talking\nabout memory and cognition.\nBut you know a lot about attention,\nand here I'm not being disparaging,\nI think people have done\nwhat I'm about to say\nas a consequence of need\nand lack of other resources.\nThere's an immense amount of\nAdderall use, Ritalin use,\nModafinil use, and caffeine abuse.\nNow, I happen to like caffeine,\nI don't use the other\ncompounds I described,\nbut it's just incredible to\nme how the data on this are,\na colleague of mine at\nStanford claims that\nsomething like two-thirds\nor more of college students\nuse these without prescription for ADHD.\nWhat can we expect in terms of the effects\nof regular exercise on attention?\nAnd are there any other\nthings besides exercise\nand meditation that you\nwould like to see people do\nin terms of trying to increase\ntheir powers of attention?\nBecause I think the\nability to focus and attend\nis really the distinguishing feature\nbetween those that will\nsucceed in any endeavor\nand those that won't.\nAnd that's a scary thing\nfor a lot of people to hear\nbecause a lot of people\nthink they have ADHD.\nThey may, they may not.\nBut I bet that a number of\nstudents at both Stanford and NYU\nfeel challenged with\nholding their attention\nto the thing that they need\nto hold their attention to.\n- Yeah, so I would say the\ntop three tools that everybody\nright this minute today can\nuse to up their capacity\nto attend where they\nwant to include exercise\nfor the reasons we've talked about.\nIt has a direct effect on functioning\nof the prefrontal cortex.\nMeditation also, clear\nclinical studies showing\nimproved ability to focus\nand particularly focus\non the present moment.\nAnd the third has to be sleep.\nSo sleep is, you can't,\nit's out of the three,\nit is the most physiological.\nI mean, I could live my whole life\nwithout meditating one minute.\nCould I survive without sleep?\nNo, none of us could.\nSo, it's more basic physiological,\nbut it is so important for\nall core cognitive functions,\nincluding attention, including creativity,\nincluding just good basic brain function.\nThat is why it's so critical\nto get that information,\nthat basic neuroscience\ninformation into the heads\nof these students that are\ntrying their best to show us\nhow their brains work, but being hampered\nbecause they're not moving\nenough, they're not meditating.\nAnd there's all these distracting things\nthat they include in their lives.\nSome of which a little bit is good,\nbut you know, 24 hours a day on your phone\nand linked in, not LinkedIn,\nbut linked to your phone\nis damaging to your attention.\nSo exercise, meditation,\nsleep can help you learn,\nretain, and perform better\nthan if you do not have\nthese three things in your life.\n- Wonderful, music to my ears.\nAnd also either very\nlow cost or zero cost,\nconsidering that the exercise\ndoesn't require a class,\none could use the freely\navailable resource of gravity\nto do jumping jacks, or burpees,\nor pushups, or whatever,\nor sit ups, or all those in combination.\n- And don't forget YouTube,\nthe freely accessible\nmillions of YouTube videos.\nIf you don't want to do your\njumping jacks by yourself,\nI always say this, I talk\nabout breath meditation\nfor my book, \"Good Anxiety,\"\nand if you don't like\nthe one that I suggest\nthere's only about a\nmillion more on YouTube\nwith ratings from one star to five stars,\nso use that resource.\n- It is a wonderful resource\nand you are an amazing resource.\nWendy, thank you so much\nfor coming here today\nto have this discussion\nand share your knowledge\nabout not just existing data,\nbut new data coming out soon,\nand for your leadership\nin the university system,\nfor your leadership in public education,\nfor the decades of\nimportant work on memory\nand neural circuitry, which we got\nto learn about today, as well.\nThank you ever so much.\n- Thank you, Andrew, fun conversation.\n- Thank you for joining\nme today for my discussion\nabout learning and memory\nand how to get better\nat learning and remembering\nwith Dr. Wendy Suzuki.\nIf you'd like to learn more\nabout Dr. Suzuki's work,\nyou can go to WendySuzuki.com.\nThere you will also find titles and links\nto her popular books, as well\nas her social media handles.\nWe've also placed those\nin the show note captions.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to us on YouTube.\nThat's a terrific zero-cost\nway to support us.\nIn addition, please subscribe\nto the podcast on Spotify\nand/or Apple, and on\nboth Spotify and Apple,\nyou can leave us up to a five-star review.\nIf you have suggestions\nabout guests or topics\nthat you'd like us to cover\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nor you'd like to give\nus feedback of any kind,\nplease leave that in the\ncomment section on YouTube,\nthat's the best place to give us feedback.\nPlease also check out\nthe sponsors mentioned\nat the beginning of today's episode,\nthat's the best way to\nsupport this podcast.\nWe also have a Patreon, it's\npatreon.com/andrewhuberman.\nAnd there you can support the podcast\nat any level that you like.\nOn many episodes of the\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nwe discuss supplements, while\nsupplements are certainly\nnot necessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like accelerating\nthe transition into sleep, and\ngetting better, deeper sleep,\nas well as enhancing focus and learning,\nand other aspects of human\nperformance and health.\nWe're excited to announce\nthat we've partnered\nwith Momentous supplements.\nThe reason we partnered with\nMomentous is several-fold.\nFirst of all, we wanted\nto have one location\nwhere Huberman Lab Podcast\nlisteners could go in order\nto find all the supplements\nthat we talk about\nand to find those in a\nform where they could\nsystematically try one or the other.\nThis is a real issue in\nthe supplement industry.\nA lot of supplement\nbrands out there combine\ndifferent ingredients in ways\nthat don't really allow you\nto pinpoint exactly what you\nneed and what you don't need.\nSo getting supplements\nthat have low doses,\nor just the minimal effective dose\nof particular ingredients, and\nbeing able to mix and match\nthose ingredients yourself,\nand really establish\nwhat's best for you is really key.\nIn addition, we came to realize\nthat a lot of our listeners\nwant supplements, but they reside\noutside of the United States.\nSo we're pleased to tell\nyou that Momentous ships\nboth within the US and internationally.\nAnd of course, Momentous supplements\nare of the very highest\nquality ingredients\nand the precision of the\namounts of those ingredients\nis tightly regulated.\nIf you're interested in\nMomentous supplements,\nthe catalog of supplements related\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast\nare growing all the time.\nA good number of them are already there.\nYou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman\nin order to find them.\nAnd there will be\nadditional supplements added\nto that site as we go forward.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Twitter and Instagram,\nI post neuroscience\nand other science-related information\nand tools on a regular basis.\nSome of that information\noverlaps with the content\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut a lot of it is distinct\nfrom the information contained\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nSo again, that's Huberman Lab on Instagram\nand Huberman Lab on Twitter.\nWe also have a Neural Network Newsletter.\nWhat that is is a monthly\nnewsletter in which I distill\ncritical points from\ndifferent podcast episodes,\nprovide links to useful resources.\nIf you want to sign up\nfor that newsletter,\nI should mention it is zero cost,\nand we do not share\nyour email with anybody,\nand we have a very clear privacy policy\nposted at hubermanlab.com,\njust go to hubermanlab.com,\nclick on the menu, you'll see\nthe Neural Network Newsletter.\nYou can also look at\nexamples of newsletters\nwithout having to sign up to make sure\nthat you actually do want to sign up.\nBut if you are interested,\nthe signup is there,\nvery easy and you can receive\nour monthly newsletter.\nSo once again, thank you for\njoining me today for our voyage\ninto the neuroscience of\nlearning and memory and tools\nto get better at learning and memory.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[upbeat rock music]"
