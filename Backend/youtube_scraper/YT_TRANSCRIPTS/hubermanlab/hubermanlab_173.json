    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman and I'm a professor\nof neurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday we are discussing memory.\nIn particular, how to improve your memory.\nNow the study of memory\nis one that dates back\nmany decades, and by now there's\na pretty good understanding\nof how memories are formed in the brain.\nThe different structures involved\nand some of the neuro chemicals involved.\nAnd we will talk about some of that today.\nOften overlooked,\nhowever, is that memories\nare not just about learning.\nMemories are also about\nplacing your entire life\ninto a context.\nAnd that's because what's\nreally special about the brain\nand in particular the human brain,\nis its ability to place\nevents in the context\nof past events, the present,\nand future events.\nAnd sometimes even combinations\nof the past and present.\nOr present and future and so on.\nSo when we talk about memory\nwhat we're really talking about\nis how your immediate experiences relate\nto previous and future experiences.\nToday I'm going to make clear how\nthat process occurs.\nEven if you don't have a background\nin biology or psychology, I promise\nto put it into language that anyone\ncan access and understand.\nAnd we are going to talk about\nthe science that points to specific tools\nfor enhancing learning and memory.\nWe're also going to talk about unlearning\nand forgetting.\nThere are of course incidences in which\nwe would like to forget things.\nAnd that too is a biological process\nfor which great tools exist.\nTo, for instance, eliminate\nor at least reduce\nthe emotional load of\na previous experience\nthat you really did not like,\nor that perhaps even was traumatic to you.\nSo today you're going to learn\nabout the systems in the brain and body\nthat establish memories.\nYou're going to learn why certain memories\nare easier to form than others.\nAnd I'm going to talk about specific tools\nthat are grounded in not just one,\nnot just a dozen, but\nwell over 100 studies\nin animals and humans that point\nto specific protocols that you can use\nin order to stamp down learning\nof particular things more easily.\nAnd you can also leverage\nthat same knowledge\nto better forget or unload\nthe emotional weight\nof experiences that you did not like.\nWe're also going to\ndiscuss topics like deja vu\nand photographic memory.\nAnd for those of you that do not\nhave a photographic memory,\nand I should point out that I do not have\na photographic memory, either.\nWell, you will learn how to use\nyour visual system in\norder to better learn\nvisual and auditory information.\nThere are protocols to do this\ngrounded in excellent\npeer reviewed research.\nSo while you may not have\na true photographic memory,\nby the end of the episode you will\nhave tools in hand, or I should say,\ntools in mind or in eyes and mind,\nto be able to encode and\nremember specific events\nbetter than you would otherwise.\nBefore we begin I would like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Eight Sleep.\nEight Sleep makes smart mattress covers\nwith cooling, heating, and sleep tracking.\nMany times on this\npodcast I've talked about\nthe incredible relationship\nbetween temperature and sleep\nas well as temperature and wakefulness.\nMany people aren't aware of this,\nbut waking up in the morning is in part\nthe consequence of your body heating up.\nAnd falling asleep at night\nand remaining in deep sleep\nis in part the consequence\nof your body temperature\ndropping by one to three degrees.\nSo it's vitally important\nthat the temperature\nof your sleeping\nenvironment is controlled.\nI've had trouble over the years\nfalling and staying asleep.\nOr I should say, falling\nasleep hasn't been\nso much of an issue for me,\nbut waking up two or\nthree or four hours later\nhas been an issue.\nOften times I'm too warm,\nI need to open a window.\nI need to adjust the temperature\nof the room and so on.\nEight Sleep mattress covers are terrific\nbecause you can program\nthe specific patterns\nof temperature that you want in your bed,\nor I should say below you,\ncoming from the mattress,\nthroughout the night.\nSo I've programmed my Eight Sleep\nto put my mattress into\na state of coolness\nin order to fall asleep.\nAnd then to get slightly\ncooler as the night goes on.\nTo get into even deeper sleep.\nAnd then to warm up as morning approaches.\nNow, as mentioned before,\nEight Sleep mattresses\ncan be used for cooling and heating.\nSo some of you may actually need\nto heat your mattress and Eight\nSleep's terrific for that.\nFor me, I use Eight Sleep to\nkeep the mattress really cool.\nAnd I have to say, even though I thought\nI was sleeping pretty well before,\nI have not experienced the sort of sleep\nthat I've been getting\nwith Eight Sleep until now.\nBy creating this descending temperature\nin the beginning part of the night,\ncooler, cooler, cooler.\nAnd then warming up towards morning.\nIt even has a nice\nlittle vibration function\nso I wake up now to a\nslightly vibrating bed.\nAnd the sleep that I'm\ngetting is just amazing.\nAnd I feel so much better\nduring the day as a consequence.\nIf you'd like to try Eight Sleep\nyou can go to EightSleep.com/Huberman\nand check out the pod pro cover\nand save 150 dollars at checkout.\nEight Sleep currently ships within\nthe USA, Canada, and the UK.\nAgain, that's EightSleep.com/Huberman\nto save 150 dollars at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nAnd to be quite honest, I\ndon't like the word nootropics.\nBecause nootropics means smart drugs.\nAnd there really isn't\na neuroscience of smart.\nOf course, there is this\nnotion of intelligence,\nbut we now know there are lots\nof different forms of intelligence.\nAlso, as a neuroscientist,\nwe don't really think about intelligence,\nwe think about those particular types\nof operations that you\nwant your brain to perform\nin different contexts.\nSo for instance, some\ntasks and life experiences\nrequire that you remember\ninformation better.\nOther tasks and life experiences\nand forms of learning involve\nfocus and task switching.\nOthers creativity, and so on, and so on.\nSo the word nootropics is too much\nof a catchall or throw away\nphrase to appeal to me.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd what they've done is they've created\nnootropics that are each designed\ntoward a particular end goal.\nFor instance, they have blends for focus.\nBlend for motivation.\nA blend for clarity.\nThey use only the highest\nquality ingredients.\nThings like Alpha GPC\nand phosphatidyl serine.\nI've been using Thesis for\nclose to six months now\nand I can confidently say their nootropics\nhave been a game changer for me.\nI often take the clarity formula\nprior to long bouts of work,\nmeaning cognitive work.\nAnd the energy formula\nprior to physical workouts.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropics starter kit,\nyou can go online to\nTakeThesis.com/Huberman.\nTake the three minute quiz\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas to\ntry in your first month.\nAgain, that's TakeThesis.com/Huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done.\nFor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nOne of the challenges\nwith a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you'll get the numbers back.\nYou'll get information\nabout your blood lipids\nand hormones and so forth.\nBut there are no directives as to what\nto do with that information.\nInsideTracker has solved that problem\nby creating a very easy to use dashboard.\nSo you'll get your numbers back\nand you see what's in range\nand what's out of range.\nAnd then they will point you\nto specific nutritional supplementation\nand behavioral tools that\nwill allow you to bring\nthose numbers into the\nproper ranges for you.\nAnd I find that immensely beneficial\nbecause just having a bunch of data\nwithout any knowledge of\nwhat to do with that data\nis more overwhelming than\nhaving no data at all, frankly.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nAgain, that's InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 20% off.\nOkay, let's talk about memory.\nAnd let's talk about how to get better\nat remembering things.\nNow in order to address\nboth of those things\nwe need to do a little bit\nof brain science 101 review.\nAnd I promise this will\nonly take two minutes.\nAnd I promise that even if\nyou don't have a background\nin biology, it will make sense.\nWe are constantly being\nbombarded with physical stimuli.\nPatterns of touch on our skin,\nlight to our eyes, light to\nour skin, for that matter.\nSmells, tastes, and sound waves.\nIn fact, if you can hear\nme saying this right now,\nwell, that's the\nconsequence of sound waves\narriving into your ears\nthrough headphones,\na computer, or some other speaker device.\nEach one of and all of\nthose sensory stimuli\nare converted into electricity\nand chemical signals by your\nso-called nervous system.\nYour brain, your spinal cord,\nand all their connections\nwith the organs of the body.\nAnd all the connections\nof your organs of the body\nback to your brain and spinal cord.\nOne of the primary jobs of\nyour nervous system, in fact,\nis to convert physical events in the world\nthat are non-negotiable, right?\nPhotons of light are photons of light.\nSound waves are sound waves.\nThere's no changing that.\nBut your nervous system does change that.\nIt converts those things\ninto electrical signals\nand chemical signals which are\nthe language of your nervous system.\nNow just because you're being bombarded\nwith all this sensory information\nand it's being converted into a language\nthat neurons and the rest\nof your nervous system\ncan understand, does not mean\nthat you are aware of it all.\nIn fact, you are only going to perceive\na small amount of that\nsensory information.\nFor instance, if you can\nhear me speaking right now\nyou are perceiving my\nvoice but you are also,\nmost likely, neglecting the feeling\nof the contact of your\nskin with whichever surface\nyou happen to be sitting or standing on.\nSo it is only by perceiving a subset,\na small fraction of the sensory events\nin our environment, that we can make sense\nof the world around us.\nOtherwise we would just be overwhelmed\nwith all the things that are happening\nin any one given moment.\nNow memory is simply a bias in which\nperceptions will be replayed\nagain in the future.\nAnytime you experience something,\nthat is the consequence of specific chains\nof neurons, that we call neural\ncircuits, being activated.\nAnd memory is simply a\nbias in the likelihood\nthat specific chain of neurons\nwill be activated again.\nSo for instance, if you\ncan remember your name\nand I certainly hope that you can,\nwell, that means that\nthere are specific chains\nof neurons in your brain\nthat represent your name\nand when those neurons\nconnect with one another\nand communicate electrically\nwith one another\nin a particular sequence,\nyou remember your name.\nWere that particular chain\nof neurons to be disrupted,\nyou would not be able\nto remember your name.\nNow this might seem immensely simple,\nbut it raises this really\ninteresting question\nwhich we've talked about before.\nWhich is, why do we\nremember certain things\nand not others?\nBecause according to what I've just said,\nas you go through life,\nyou're experiencing things all the time.\nYou're constantly being\nbombarded with sensory stimuli.\nSome of those sensory\nstimuli you perceive,\nand only some of those perceptions\nget stamped down as memories.\nToday I'm going to teach\nyou how certain things\nget stamped down as memories.\nAnd I'm going to teach you how\nto leverage that process in order\nto remember the information\nthat you want far better.\nNow, even though I've told you\nthat a memory is simply\na bias in the likelihood\nthat a particular chain of neurons\nwill be activated in a particular sequence\nagain and again, it\ndoesn't operate on its own.\nIn fact, most of what\nwe remember takes place\nin a context of other events.\nSo for instance, you can most\nlikely remember your name\nand yet you're probably not thinking about\nwhen it was that you\nfirst learned your name.\nThis generally happens when we are very,\nvery young children.\nAnd yet, I'm guessing you\ncould probably remember\na time when someone\nmispronounced your name,\nor made fun of or name.\nOr, as the case was for me,\nI got to the 3rd grade and\nthere were two Andrews.\nAnd sadly for me, I lost the coin flip\nthat allowed me to keep Andrew.\nAnd from about 3rd grade\nuntil about 12th grade\npeople called me Andy.\nWhich I really did not prefer.\nSo if you call me Andy in the comments,\nI'll delete your comment.\nJust kidding, doesn't bother me that much.\nBut eventually I reclaimed\nAndrew as my name.\nWell, it was mine to\nbegin with and throughout,\nbut I started going by Andrew again.\nWhy do I say this?\nWell, there's a whole\ncontext to my name for me.\nAnd there may or not be a whole context\nto your name for you.\nBut presumably, if you asked your parents\nwhy they named you your given name,\nyou'll get a context, etc.\nThat context reflects the activation\nof other neural circuits that are also\nrelated to other events in your life.\nNot just your name, but\nprobably your siblings names\nand who your parents are.\nAnd on, and on, and on.\nAnd so, the way memory works is that each\nindividual thing that we remember\nor that we want to remember\nis linked to something by either\na close, a medium, or a\nvery distant association.\nThis turns out to be immensely important.\nI know many of you will read\nor will encounter\nprograms that are designed\nto help you enhance your memory.\nYou know, you have these\nphenoms that can remember\n50 names in a room full of people.\nOr they can remember a bunch\nof names of novel objects\nor maybe even in different languages,\nand often times that's\ndone by association.\nSo people will come up\nwith little mental tricks\nto either link the sound of a word\nor the meaning of a word in some way\nthat's meaningful for them\nand will enhance their memory.\nThat can be done and is\nimpressive when we see it\nand for those of you who can\ndo that, congratulations.\nMost of us can't do that,\nor at least it requires a\nlot of effort and training.\nHowever, there are things that we can do\nthat leverage the natural biology\nof our nervous system to enhance\nlearning and memory of\nparticular perceptions,\nand particular information.\nLet's first just talk about\nthe most basic ways that we\nlearn and remember things\nand how to improve learning and memory.\nAnd the most basic one is repetition.\nNow the study of memory and the role\nof repetition actually dates back\nto the late 1800s, early 1900s\nwhen Ebbinghaus developed\nthe first so-called learning curves.\nNow learning curves\nare simply what results\nwhen you quantify how many repetitions\nof something are required in\norder to remember something.\nIn fact, it's been said\nthat Ebbinghaus liberated\nthe understanding of learning\nfrom the philosophers\nby generating these learning curves.\nWhat do we mean by that?\nWell, before Ebbinghaus came along,\nlearning and memory were thought\nto be philosophical ideas.\nEbbinghaus came along and said, well,\nlet's actually take some measurements.\nLet's measure how well I can remember\na sequence of words or\na sequence of numbers\nif I just repeat them.\nSo what Ebbinghaus did is he would\ntake a sequence of numbers,\nor words on a page and he would read them.\nAnd then he would take a\nseparate sheet of paper.\nAnd we have to presume he didn't cheat,\nand he would write down as many of them\nas he could and he would try and keep\nthem in the same sequence.\nThen he would compare to the original list\nand he would see how many errors he made.\nAnd he would do this over, and over,\nand over again.\nAnd as you would expect,\nearly in the training and the learning\nit took a lot more repetitions\nto get the sequence correct.\nAnd over time, it took fewer sequences.\nAnd he referred to that difference\nin the initial number of repetitions\nthat he had to perform versus\nthe later number of repetitions he had\nto perform as a so-called savings.\nSo he literally thought of the brain\nas having to generate a kind\nof a currency of effort.\nAnd he talked about\nsavings as the reduction\nin the amount of effort that he had\nto put forward in order\nto learn information.\nAnd what he got was a learning curve.\nAnd you can imagine what that\nlearning curve looked like.\nIt had a very sharp peak at the beginning\nthat dropped off over time.\nAnd of course, he remembered all this\nmeaningless information.\nBut even though the information might\nhave been meaningless,\nthe experiment itself\nand what Ebbinghaus demonstrated\nwas immensely meaningful.\nBecause what it said\nwas that with repetition\nwe can activate particular\nsequences of neurons\nand that repeated activation lays down\nwhat we call a memory.\nAnd that might all seem like a big duh,\nbut prior to Ebbinghaus,\nnone of that was known.\nNow, I should also say Ebbinghaus,\nbecause of when he was alive,\nwas not aware of these things\nthat we called neural circuits.\nIt was in 1906 that Golgi\nand Cajal got the Nobel prize\nfor actually showing that\nneurons are independent cells\nconnected by synapses, these\nlittle gaps between them\nwhere they communicate.\nSo he may have been aware of that,\nbut the whole notion of neural circuits\nhadn't really come about.\nNevertheless, what the\nEbbinghaus learning curves\nreally established was\nthat sheer repetition,\njust repeating things over\nand over and over again\nis sufficient to learn.\nSomething that no doubt\nhad been observed before\nbut had never been formally quantified.\nNow, if we look at that result,\nthere's something really\nimportant that lies\na little bit cryptic, that's\nnot so obvious to most people.\nWhich is, the information\nthat he was trying to learn\nwasn't any more\ninteresting the second time\nthan it was the first, probably\nit was even less interesting\nand less and less interesting\nwith each repetition.\nAnd yet it was sheer repetition\nthat allowed him to remember.\nNow sometime later in\nthe early to mid 1920s,\na psychologist in Canada named Donald Hebb\ncame up with what was\ncalled Hebb's postulate.\nAnd Hebb's postulate, broadly speaking,\nis this idea that if a sequence of neurons\nis active at the same time,\nor at roughly the same time,\nthat would lead to a strengthening\nof a connections between those neurons.\nAnd many, many decades\nof experimentation later\nwe now know that postulate to be true.\nNeurons themselves are not\nsmart, they don't have knowledge.\nSo every memory is the consequence,\nas I told you before, of\nthe repeated activation\nof a particular chain of neurons.\nAnd what Ebbinghaus\nshowed through repetition\nand what Donald Hebb proposed\nand was eventually verified\nthrough experimentation\non animals and humans\nwas that if you encourage\nthe co-activation of neurons.\nMeaning have neurons fire\nat roughly the same time,\nthey will strengthen their connections.\nIt leads to a bias in the probability\nthat those neurons will be active again.\nNow, this is vitally\nimportant because nowadays\nwe hear a lot about how\nmemories are the consequence\nof new neurons added into the brain.\nOr that every time you learn something,\na new connection in your brain forms.\nWell, sorry to break it to you,\nbut that's simply not the case.\nMost of the time, and I\nwant to emphasize most,\nnot all but most of the\ntime when we learn something\nit's because existing\nneurons, not new neurons,\nbut existing neurons\nstrengthen their connections\nthrough co-activation\nover and over and over.\nThrough repetition or, and\nthis is a very important or,\nor through very strong\nactivation once and only once.\nIn fact, there's something\ncalled one trial learning\nwhereby we experience something\nand we will remember that thing forever.\nThis is often most associated\nwith negative events,\nand I'll explain why in a few minutes.\nBut it can also be associated\nwith positive events.\nLike the first time you\nsaw your romantic partner.\nOr something that happened\nwith that romantic partner.\nOr the first time that you saw your child.\nOr any other positive\nevent, as well as any other\nextremely negative event.\nSo again, both repetition, and I guess\nwe could label it intensity.\nBut what we really mean\nwhen we say intensity\nis strong activation\nof neurons can lay down\nthese traces, these circuits\nthat are far more likely\nto be active again, than had\nthere not been repetition\nor not some strong\nactivation of those circuits.\nSo with that in mind, let's\nreturn to the original\ncontrarian question that I raised before.\nWhich is, why do we remember anything?\nEveryday you wake up, your neurons\nin your brain and body are active.\nDifferent neural circuits are active.\nAnd yet, you only\nremember a small fraction\nof the things that happen each day.\nAnd yet, you retain a lot of information\nfrom previous days and the\ndays before those and so on.\nIt is only with a lot of repetition\nor with extremely strong activation\nof a given neural circuit that\nwe will create new memories.\nAnd so in a few minutes I'll explain how\nto get extremely strong activation\nof particular neural circuits.\nRepetition is pretty obvious.\nRepetition is repetition.\nBut in a few minutes I'll illustrate\na whole set of experiments and a whole set\nof tools that point to how you can get\nextra strong activation\nof a given neural circuit\nas it relates to learning so that you will\nremember that information,\nperhaps not just\nwith one trial of learning,\nbut certainly with far fewer repetitions\nthan would be required otherwise.\nBefore we go any further I want to preface\nthe discussion by saying\nthat there are a lot of\ndifferent kinds of memory.\nIn fact, were you to take a voyage\ninto the neuroscience, and\nor psychology of memory\nyou would find an immense number\nof different terms to describe\nthe immense number of different types\nof memory that researchers focus on.\nBut for the sake of today's discussion,\nI really just want to\nfocus on short term memory,\nmedium term memory, and longterm memory.\nAnd while there is still debate,\nas is always the case\nwith scientists, frankly,\nabout the exact divisions between\nshort term, medium, and longterm memory,\nwe can broadly define short term memory\nand longterm memory.\nAnd we can describe a\ncouple different types\nof those that I think you can relate to\nin your everyday life.\nThe most common form of short term memory\nthat we're going to focus\non is called working memory.\nWorking memory is your ability to keep\na chain of numbers in mind\nfor some period of time\nbut the expectation really isn't\nthat you would remember\nthose numbers the next day\nand certainly not the next week.\nSo a good example would be a phone number.\nIf I were to tell ya a phone number,\n493-2938, well you could\nprobably remember it.\n493-2938.\nBut if I came back tomorrow and asked you\nto repeat that chain of numbers,\nmost likely you would not.\nUnless, of course, we\nused a particular tool\nto stamp down that memory into your mind\nand commit it to longterm memory.\nNow of course, in this day in age,\nmost people have phone numbers\nprogrammed into their phone\nand they don't really have to\nremember the exact numbers.\nIt's usually done by contact\nidentity and so forth.\nSo a different example that some of you\nare probably more familiar with\nwould be those security codes.\nSo you try and log unto\nan app or a website\nand it asks you for a security code\nthat's been sent to your text messages\nand you can either plug that in directly\nin some cases, or you have to remember\nthat short sequence of anywhere usually\nfrom six to seven,\nsometimes eight numbers.\nYour ability to do that,\nto switch back and forth\nbetween web pages or apps\nand plug in that number\nby remembering the sequence\nand plugging it in,\nby texting or keying\nit in on your keyboard,\nthat's a really good\nexample of working memory.\nLongterm memory, of the sort that we're\ngoing to be talking a lot about today\nis your ability to commit certain patterns\nof information, either\ncognitive information\nor motor information.\nRight, the ability to move your limbs\nin a particular sequence.\nOver long periods of time.\nSuch that you could remember it a day,\nor a week, or a month,\nor maybe even a year\nor several years later.\nSo we've got short term\nmemory and longterm memory.\nAnd we've got this working memory\nwhich is sort of keeping something online\nbut then discarding okay.\nNot online on a computer,\nbut online within your brain.\nThere are also two major\ncategories of memory\nthat I'd like you to know about.\nOne is explicit memory.\nSo this is not necessarily explicit\nof the sort that you're\nused to thinking about.\nBut rather the fact that you\ncan declare you know something.\nSo you have an explicit\nmemory of your name.\nPresumably you have an explicit memory\nof the house or the apartment\nthat you grew up in.\nYou know something and\nyou know you know it.\nAnd you can declare it.\nSo I can ask you, what was the color\nof the first car that you owned?\nOr what is the color of your\nromantic partner's hair?\nThese sorts of things.\nThat's an explicit declarative memory.\nBut you also have explicit\nprocedural memories.\nNow procedural memories,\nas the name suggests,\ninvolve action sequences.\nThe simplest one, it's\nalmost ridiculously simple,\nis walking.\nIf I say, how is it that you walk\nfrom one room to the other?\nYou'd probably say,\nwell, I go that direction\nand then I turn left.\nI say, no, no, no.\nHow is it exactly that you do it?\nYou say, well, I move my left foot,\nthen my right foot, then my left foot.\nAnd you could describe that.\nSo it's an explicit procedural memory.\nSo much so that if you were going\nto teach a young toddler how to walk,\nyou would probably say\nokay, good, good, try.\nOkay, then you know, probably\nthat's going to be pre-language\nfor the toddler.\nBut you're going to encourage them\nto move one leg then the other.\nAnd you're going to\nencourage and reward them\nfor moving one leg then the other.\nBecause you have an explicit\nprocedural memory of how to walk.\nOkay, almost ridiculously simple.\nMaybe even truly ridiculously simple,\nbut nonetheless, when you think about it\nin the context of neural\ncircuits and neural firing,\npretty amazing.\nEven more amazing is the fact that all\nexplicit memories, both declarative\nand procedural explicit memories\ncan be moved from explicit to implicit.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, in the example of walking\nyou might have chuckled a little bit\nor kind of shook your head and said,\nthis is a ridiculous thing to ask.\nHow do I walk from one room to the next?\nI just walk.\nI just do it.\nAh, well, what is just do it?\nWhat it is, is that you have\nan implicit understanding.\nMeaning your nervous\nsystem knows how to walk\nwithout you actually having to think about\nwhat you know about how to walk.\nYou just get up out of your chair\nor you get up out of bed and you walk.\nIn the brain you have a structure.\nIn fact, you have one on\neach side of your brain.\nIt's called the hippocampus.\nThe hippocampus literally means seahorse.\nAnatomists like to name\nbrain structures after things\nthat they think those\nbrain structures resemble.\nWhen I look at the hippocampus,\nfrankly, it doesn't look like a seahorse.\nWhich either reflects\nmy lack of understanding\nof what a seahorse really\nlooks like, a visual deficit,\nor I think it's fair to say\nthat those anatomists\nwere using a little bit\nof creative elaboration\nwhen thinking about\nwhat the hippocampus looks like.\nNonetheless, it is a curved structure.\nIt has many layers.\nIt's been described by my\ncolleague Robert Sapolsky\nand by others as looking\nmore like a jelly roll\nor a cinnamon roll, is\nwhat it looks like to me.\nAnd if you were to take one cinnamon roll,\nchop it down the middle.\nSo now you've got two half cinnamon rolls\nand rather than put them back together\nin the configuration they were before,\nyou just slide one down so that you've got\nessentially two C's.\nTwo C-shaped halves of this cinnamon roll\nand you push them together, right,\nslightly off set from one another.\nWell, that's what the\nhippocampus looks like to me.\nAnd I think that's a\nfar better description\nof its actual physical structure.\nBut I guess if you were to\nuse that physical structure\nas the name, well then\nyou'd have to open up\na brain atlas and it would be called\ntwo half-C cinnamon rolls\nstuffed halfway together.\nSo that's not very good.\nSo I guess, seahorse will work.\nHippocampus is the name of this structure\nand it is the site in your brain,\nand again, you have one on\neach side of your brain,\nin which explicit declarative\nmemories are formed.\nIt is not where those memories\nare stored and maintained.\nIt is where they are\nestablished in the first place.\nIn contrast, implicit memories,\nthe subconscious memories,\nare formed and stored\nelsewhere in the brain.\nMainly by areas like the cerebellum,\nbut also the neocortex,\nthe kind of outer shell of your brain.\nThe cerebellum literally means mini-brain.\nAnd it does in fact\nlook like a mini-brain.\nAnd is in the back of the brain.\nAnd the neocortex is the\nouter part of the brain\nthat covers all the other stuff.\nSo, the hippocampus is vitally important\nfor establishing these\nnew, declarative memories\nof what you know and\nwhat you know how to do.\nNow, in order to really\nunderstand the role\nof the hippocampus in\nmemory, in particular\nexplicit declarative, and\nexplicit procedural memory\nand to really understand\nhow that's distinct\nfrom implicit declarative and\nimplicit procedural memories\nwe have to look to a clinical case.\nAnd the clinical case\nthat I'm referring to\nis a patient who went by the name HM.\nPatient's go by their initials in order\nto maintain confidentiality\nof their real identity.\nHM had what's called intractable epilepsy.\nSo he would have these really dramatic,\nso-called grand mal\nseizures, or drop seizures.\nFor those of you that know\nsomebody with epilepsy,\nor that have epilepsy, you\nmight be familiar with this.\nYou can have petite mal seizures,\nwhich are minor seizures.\nYou can have tonic clonic seizures,\nwhich are sometimes not even detectable.\nYou can have absent seizures where people\nwill just stop, it's\nalmost as if their brain\nkind of goes on pause and\nthey'll just stop there.\nIt was reported actually that\nEinstein had absent seizures.\nAlthough I don't know that's ever\nreally been confirmed neurologically.\nGrand mal seizures are extremely severe\nand that's what HM had.\nSo he could just be going about his day\nand maybe even cooking, or\ndoing something, driving,\noperating any kind of machinery,\nand then all of a sudden\nhe would just have\na drop seizure.\nSo he would just physically drop\nand go into a grand mal seizure.\nSo convulsing of the whole body,\nloss of consciousness, etc.\nOr he would feel it coming on.\nOften times people with epilepsy\ncan feel the epileptic seizure coming on.\nKind of like a wave from\nthe back of the brain.\nAnd sometimes they can get\nto a safe circumstance, but not always.\nAnd so the frequency and the\nintensity of his seizures\nwere so robust that the neurosurgeons\nand neurologists decided\nthat they needed to locate\nthe origin, what they call the foci\nof those seizures, and\nremove that brain tissue.\nBecause the way seizures work\nis they spread out from that focus,\nor that foci of brain tissue.\nAnd unfortunately for HM,\nthe focus of his seizures\nwas the hippocampus.\nSo after a lot of deliberation,\na neurosurgeon, in fact\none of the most famous\nneurosurgeons in the world at that time,\nmade what are called electrolytic lesions,\nactually burned out the\nhippocampus in the brain of HM.\nAnd as a consequence, he\nlost all explicit memory.\nNow the consequence of this\nwas that he couldn't exist in normal,\neveryday life, like most people.\nSo he had to live mostly, not entirely,\nbut mostly in a kind of hospital setting.\nAnd I've talked to\nseveral people, who have\nI should say, who met HM directly,\nbecause he's no longer alive.\nBut an interaction with him\nmight look like the following.\nHe would walk up to you just fine.\nYou wouldn't know that he\nhad any kind of brain damage.\nHe could walk fine, he could speak fine.\nAnd you'd say, hi, I'm Andrew.\nAnd he'd say, hi, I'm whatever\nhis name happened to be.\nHe wouldn't say HM, but he'd\nprobably say his real name.\nAnd then perhaps someone new\nwould walk into the room.\nHe might turn around, look at that person,\nas any of us might do.\nThen turn around back to me\nand say, hi, what's your name?\nAnd if I were to say, well,\nI just told you my name.\nAnd you just told me your\nname, do you remember that?\nAnd he'd say, I'm sorry, I\ndon't remember any of that.\nWhat's your name?\nSo you'd go through this\nover and over again.\nSo a complete lack of\nexplicit declarative memory.\nNow he did have some memory for\nprevious events in his life\nthat dated way back, okay.\nAgain, hinting at the idea that memories\nare not necessarily\nstored in the hippocampus,\nthey're just formed in the hippocampus.\nSo once they've moved\nout of the hippocampus\nto other brain areas, he could\nstill keep those memories.\nThey're in a different\ndatabase, if you will.\nThey're in a different pattern of firing\nof other neural circuits.\nBut he couldn't form new memories.\nNow there's some very important\nand interesting twists on what HM could\nand could not do in terms\nof learning and memory\nthat teach us a lot about the brain.\nIn fact, I think most\nneuroscientists would agree\nthat this unfortunate\ncase of HM's epilepsy\nand the subsequent neuro\nsurgery that he had\ntaught us much of what we know,\nor at least think about,\nin terms of human learning and memory.\nFor instance, as I mentioned before,\nhe still had implicit knowledge.\nHe knew how to walk.\nHe knew how to do certain things like\nmake a cup of coffee.\nHe knew the names of people\nthat he had met much earlier\nin his life, and so on.\nAnd yet he couldn't form new memories.\nNow, in violation to that last statement,\nthere were some elements\nof HM's emotionality\nthat suggests that there was some sort\nof residual capacity to\nlearn new information\nbut it wasn't what we normally think of\nas explicit declarative\nor procedural memory.\nFor instance, it's been reported\nor it's been said, I should say,\nbecause I don't know that the studies\nwere ever done with intense\nphysiological measurements,\nthat if you were to tell HM a joke,\nand he thought it was funny,\nhe would laugh really hard.\nHe liked jokes, so you'd say hey, HM,\nI want to tell you a joke.\nYou tell him a joke and\nhe'd laugh really hard.\nThen you could leave the room, come back,\nand tell him the same joke again.\nNow keep in mind, he did not remember\nthat you told him the joke previously.\nAnd the second time he would\nlaugh a little bit less.\nAnd then you'd leave the\nroom, come back again.\nSay hi, I'm Andrew.\nAnd he'd say, oh, nice to meet you.\nBecause as you know, as you recall,\nbecause you can recall things.\nBut he couldn't recall things.\nHe didn't know that he just met you.\nOr at least he couldn't remember it.\nYou tell him the joke a\nthird time, or a fourth time,\nand with each subsequent\ntelling of the joke\nhe found it a little less funny.\nJust as, keep this in mind, folks,\nif you tell a joke and\nyou get a big laugh,\ndon't tell it again.\nAt least not immediately.\nNot to the same person or the same crowd\nbecause the second time\nit's a little less funny\nand the third time it's\na little less funny.\nAnd that actually has to\ndo with a whole element\nof dopamine and it's\nrelationship to surprise.\nAnd that's the topic of a future podcast\nwhere we talk all about humor\nand novelty in the brain.\nBut the point being that\ncertain forms of memory\nseem to exist in a kind\nof phantom like way\nwithin HM's brain.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, this underscores that he had\nan implicit memory of having\nheard the joke before.\nAnd it suggests that humor, or\nat least what we find funny,\nis somehow more related to procedures.\nSimilar to walking or a motor ability\nthan it is to this precise\ncontent of that joke.\nAll right, that's a little\nbit of an abstract concept,\nbut the point is that HM lacked\nexplicit declarative memory.\nHe couldn't tell you\nwhat he had just heard.\nHe could not learn new information.\nAnd he couldn't tell\nyou how to do something\nunless he had learned\nhow to do that something\nmany years prior.\nNow, there have been a lot\nof other patients besides HM\nthat have had brain\nlesions due to epilepsy,\nor I should say due to\nsurgeries to treat epilepsy,\ndue to strokes, due to\nsadly gunshot wounds\nand other forms of what\nwe call infarcts, infarct.\nI-N-F-A-R-C-T, infarct is the word we use\nto describe damage to a\nparticular brain region.\nAnd many different patients\nwith many different patterns\nof infarct have taught\nus a lot about how memory\nand other aspects of the brain work.\nHM really teaches us that what we know\nand what we are able to\ndo is the consequence\nof things that we are aware of\nand learnings that have been passed off\ninto subconscious knowledge,\nthat our body knows.\nOur brain knows, but we don't know exactly\nhow we know that thing.\nAnd I tell you the\nstory about HM's ability\nto understand a joke, but\nthat with repeated telling\nof the joke it has less and less and less\nof an impact in creating\na sense of laughter,\nof humor in HM.\nNot as just an anecdote\nto flesh out his story,\nbut because emotion itself turns out\nto be the way in which\nwe can enhance memories\neven if those are memories for things\nthat are not funny, are not intensely sad,\nare not immensely happy or don't evoke\na really strong emotional response,\nor even any emotional response.\nAnd the reason for that is that emotions,\njust like perception, just like sensation,\nare the consequence of\nparticular neuro chemicals\nbeing present in our brain and body.\nAnd as I'm going to tell you next,\nthere are particular neuro chemicals\nthat you can leverage in order to learn\nspecific information\nfaster and to remember it\nfor a much longer period of time,\nmaybe even forever.\nAnd you can do that by leveraging\nthe relationship in your nervous system\nbetween your brain and your body.\nAnd your body back to your brain.\nSo let's talk about tools\nfor enhancing memory.\nNow there's one tool that\nit's absolutely clear works.\nAnd it's always worked, it works now,\nand it will work forever.\nAnd that's repetition.\nThe more often that you perform something\nor that you recite something,\nthe more likely you are to\nremember it in the future.\nAnd while that might seem obvious,\nit's worth thinking about what's happening\nwhen you repeat something.\nBut when I say what's happening,\nI mean at the neural level.\nWhat's happening is\nthat you're encouraging\nthe firing of particular chains of neurons\nthat reside in a\nparticular circuit, right.\nSo a particular sequence\nof neurons playing\nneuron A, B, C, D played\nin that particular sequence\nover and over and over again.\nAnd with more repetitions,\nyou get more strengthening\nof those nerve connections.\nNow, repetition works but\nthe problem for most people\nis they either don't have the patience,\nthey don't have the time,\nand sometimes they literally\ndon't have the time\nbecause they've got a deadline\non something that they're\ntrying to remember and learn.\nOr they simply would like to be able\nto remember things better in general\nand remember them more quickly.\nThis process of accelerating\nrepetition based learning\nso that your learning curve doesn't go\nfrom having to perform\nsomething 1,000 times\nand then gradually over time\nit's 1,000, 750 times a day,\n500 times a day, 300 times a day,\nand down to no repetitions, right?\nYou can just perform\nthat thing the first time\nand every time.\nWell, there is a way to shift that curve\nso that you can essentially\nestablish stronger connections\nbetween the neurons that are involved\nin generating that memory\nor behavior more quickly.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, in order to answer that we have\nto look at the beautiful\nwork of James McGaugh\nand Larry Cahill.\nJames McGaugh and Larry Cahill did\na number experiments over\nseveral decades really\nbased on a lot of animal literature,\nbut mainly focused on humans\nthat really established what's required\nto get better at remembering things\nand to do so very quickly.\nI want to talk about one\nexperiment that they did\nthat was particularly important.\nAnd we will provide a link to this paper,\nit's some years old now,\nbut the results still hold up.\nIn fact, the results established\nan entire field of memory and\nneuroscience and psychology.\nWhat they did is they had human subjects\ncome into the laboratory and to read\na short paragraph of about 12 sentences.\nAnd the key thing is\nthat some subjects read\na paragraph that was pretty mundane.\nThe content, the information\nwithin the paragraph\nwas all related to the content\nof the previous sentence.\nSo it was a cogent paragraph.\nRight, it just wasn't a\nmeaningless scramble of words.\nBut it described a kind of\nmundane set of circumstances.\nMaybe it would be a story about someone\nwho walked into a room,\nsat down at a desk,\nwrote for a little bit, then got up\nand had lunch.\nYou know, just kind of\nmundane information.\nNot very interesting.\nAnother group of subjects read also\na 12 sentence paragraph.\nBut that paragraph included a subset\nof sentences that had a lot of\nemotionally intense language.\nOr that had language that could evoke\nan emotionally intense response\nin the person reading it.\nSo it might have talked\nabout a car accident\nor a very intense surgery.\nBut it also could be positive stuff.\nThings like a birthday party,\nor a celebration of some other kind.\nOr a big sports win.\nSo in other words, you have\ntwo conditions of this study.\nPeople either read a boring paragraph,\nor they read a really\nemotionally laden paragraph.\nAnd again, the emotions could either be\npositive or negative emotions.\nSubjects left the laboratory\nand sometime later\nthey were called back to the laboratory\nand I should say, at no\npoint in the experiment\ndid they know they were\npart of a memory experiment.\nOkay, they don't even know why\nthey were reading this paragraph.\nThey came in either for\nclass credit or to get paid.\nThat's typically how these things are done\non college campuses or elsewhere.\nThey come back into the lab\nand they would get a pop quiz.\nThey would be asked to recall the content\nof the paragraph that\nthey had read previously.\nNow as is probably expected,\nperhaps even obvious to you,\nthe subjects that read the\nemotionally intense paragraph\nremembered far more of the\ncontent of that paragraph\nand were far more accurate\nin their remembering of that information.\nNow, that particular\nfinding wasn't very novel.\nMany people had previously described\nhow emotionally intense events\nare better remembered than\nnon-emotionally intense events.\nIn fact, way back in the 1600s\nFrancis Bacon, who's largely credited\nwith developing the scientific method,\nsaid, quote, memory is\nassisted by anything\nthat makes an impression\non a powerful passion.\nInspiring fear, for example,\nor wonder, shame, or joy.\nFrancis Bacon said that in 1620.\nSo Jim McGaugh and Larry Cahill\nwere certainly not the first\nto demonstrate or to conceive of the idea\nthat emotionally laden experiences\nare more easily remembered\nthan other experiences.\nHowever, what they did next\nwas immensely important for\nour understanding of memory\nand for our building of tools\nto enhance learning and memory.\nWhat they did was they evaluated\nthe capacity for stress and for particular\nneuro chemicals associated with stress\nto improve our ability\nto learn information.\nNot just information that is emotional,\nbut information of all kinds.\nSo I'm going to describe\nsome experiments done\nin animal models just very briefly,\nand then experiments\ndone on humans subjects.\nBecause McGaugh worked mainly on animals,\nalso human subjects.\nLarry Cahill, almost\nexclusively on human subjects.\nIf you take a rat or a mouse\nand put it in an arena\nwhere at one location\nthe animal receives an electrical shock\nand then you come back the next day,\nyou remove the shock evoking device\nand you let the animal\nmove around that arena,\nthat animal will, quite understandably,\navoid the location where it was shocked.\nSo called conditioned place aversion.\nThat affect of avoiding\nthat particular location\noccurs in one trial.\nThat's a good example\nof one trial learning.\nSo somehow the animal knows\nthat it was shocked at that location,\nit remembers that.\nIt is a hippocampal dependent learning.\nSo animals that lack a hippocampus\nor who have their\nhippocampus pharmacologically\nor otherwise incapacitated, will not learn\nthat new bit of information.\nBut for animals that do, they remember it\nafter the first time and every time.\nUnless, you are to block the release\nof certain chemicals in the brain and body\nand the chemicals I'm\nreferring to are epinephrine,\nadrenaline, and to some\nextent the corticosterones.\nThings like cortisol.\nNow we know that the effect\nof getting one trial learning\nsomehow involves epinephrine,\nat least in this particular\nexperimental scenario.\nBecause if researchers do\nthe exact same experiment,\nand they have done the\nexact same experiment,\nbut they introduce a\npharmacological blocker\nof epinephrine, so that\nepinephrine is released\nin response to the shock,\nbut it cannot actually\nbind to its receptors\nand have all its biological effects,\nwell then the animal is perfectly happy\nto tread back into the area\nwhere it received the shock.\nIt's almost as if it didn't know,\nor we have to assume, it didn't remember\nthat it received the\nshock at that location.\nSo it all seems pretty\nobvious when you hear it.\nSomething bad happens in a location,\nyou don't go back to that location.\nSo that's condition place avoidance.\nBut it turns out that the\nopposite is also true.\nMeaning for something called\ncondition place preference\nyou can take an animal,\nput it into an arena,\nfeed it or reward it\nsome how at one location\nin that arena.\nSo you can give a hungry rat or mouse food\nat one particular location,\ntake the animal out,\ncome back the next day.\nNo food is introduced, but it will go back\nto the location where\nit received the food.\nOr you can do any variant of this.\nYou can make the arena a little bit chilly\nand provide warmth at that location.\nOr you can take a male animal.\nAnd it turns out male rats and mice\nwill mate at any point.\nOr a female animal\nthat's at the particular\nso called receptive\nphase of her mating cycle\nand give them an opportunity to mate\nat a give location, they'll\ngo back to that location\nand wait away.\nThis is perhaps why people go back\nto the same bar, or the seat at the bar,\nor the same restaurant and wait\nbecause of the one time they, you know,\nthings worked out for them.\nWhatever the context was.\nCondition place preference.\nCondition place preference as\nwith condition place avoidance\ndepends on the release\nof adrenaline, right.\nIt's not just about stress.\nIt's about a heightened emotional state\nin the brain and body.\nOkay, this is really important.\nIt's not just about stress.\nYou can get one trial learning\nfor positive events,\ncondition place preference.\nAnd you can get one trial\nlearning for negative events.\nHere I say positive and negative,\nI'm putting what's called valence on it.\nMaking a value judgment about whether not\nthe animal liked it or didn't like it.\nAnd we have to presume\nwhat the animal liked\nor didn't like and how it felt.\nBut this turns out all to\nbe true for humans as well.\nWe know that because McGaugh and Cahill\ndid experiments where they gave people\na boring paragraph to read\nand only a boring paragraph to read.\nBut one group of subjects was asked\nto read the paragraph and\nthen to place their arm\ninto very, very cold water.\nIn fact, it was ice water.\nWe know that placing\none's arm into ice water,\nespecially if it's up to\nthe shoulder or near to it,\nevokes the release of\nadrenaline in the body.\nIt's not an enormous release,\nbut it's a significant increase.\nAnd yes, they measured adrenaline release.\nIn some cases they also\nmeasured for things like\ncortisol, etc.\nAnd what they found is that if one evokes\nthe release of adrenaline through\nthis arm into ice water approach,\nthe information that they read previously,\njust a few minutes before,\nwas remembered, it was retained as well\nas emotionally intense information.\nBut keep in mind the\ninformation that they read\nwas not interesting at all.\nOr at least, it wasn't emotionally laden.\nThis had to be the effect\nof adrenaline released\ninto the brain and body, because\nif they blocked the release\nor the function of adrenaline in the brain\nand or body, they could block this effect.\nNow the biology of\nepinephrine and cortisol\nare a little bit complex,\nbut there's some nuance there\nthat's actually interesting\nand important to us.\nFirst of all, adrenaline is released\nin the body and in the brain.\nIt's released in the\nbody from the adrenals.\nRemember, epinephrine and\nadrenaline are the same thing.\nCortisol is also released\nfrom the adrenal glands.\nThese two little glands\nthat ride atop our kidneys.\nBut it can't cross into the brain.\nIt only has what we\ncall peripheral effects.\nQuickening of the heart rate, right?\nChanges the patterns of blood flow.\nChanges our patterns of breathing.\nIn general, makes our breathing\nmore shallow and faster.\nIn general makes our heart\nbeat more quickly, etc.\nWithin our brain we\nhave a little brain area\ncalled locus coeruleus, which\nis in the back of the brain.\nWhich has the opportunity to sprinkler\nthe rest of the brain with\nthe neuromodulator\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nas well as norepinephrine,\na related neuromodulator.\nAnd to essentially wake up or\ncreate a state of alertness\nthroughout the brain.\nSo it's a very general effect.\nThe reason we have two sites of release\nis because these neuro\nchemicals do not cross\nthe blood-brain barrier.\nAnd so waking up the body with adrenaline\nand waking up the brain are two separate,\nso-called parallel phenomena.\nCortisol can cross the blood-brain barrier\nbecause it's lipophilic.\nMeaning it can move through fatty tissue.\nAnd we'll get into the biology of that\nin another episode.\nBut cortisol in general is released\nand has much longer term effects.\nAnd as I just told you, can permeate\nthroughout the brain and body.\nAdrenaline has more local effects.\nOr at least is segregated\nbetween the brain and the body.\nThis will turn out to be important later.\nThe important thing to keep in mind\nis that it is the emotionality evoked\nby an experience, or to be more precise,\nit is the emotional state that you are in\nafter you experience something\nthat dictates whether\nor not you will learn it\nquickly or not.\nThis is absolutely important\nin terms of thinking about tools\nto improve your memory.\nAnd no, I am not going to suggest\nthat every time you\nwant to learn something\nyou plunge your arm into ice water.\nWhy won't I suggest that?\nWell, it will induce the\nrelease of adrenaline,\nbut there are better ways to\nget that adrenaline release.\nBefore I explain exactly\nwhat those tools are,\nI want to tamp down on the biology\nof how all this works.\nBecause in that understanding\nyou will have access\nto the best possible tools\nto improve your memory.\nFirst of all, McGaugh and Cahill\nwere excellent experimentalists.\nThey did not just establish that you could\nquicken the formation of a memory\nby accessing material that\nwas very emotionally laden\nor creating an emotional,\nhigh adrenaline state\nafter interacting with some thing.\nSome word, some person, some information.\nThey also tested whether\nor not that whole effect\ncould be blocked by\nblocking the emotional state\nor by blocking adrenaline.\nSo what they did is they\nhad people read paragraphs\nthat either had a lot of emotional content\nor they had people read paragraphs\nthat were pretty boring, but then had them\nput their arm into ice water.\nAnd I should say they\ndid other experiments too\nto increase adrenaline.\nThere were even some shock experiments\nthat were done by other groups.\nAny number of things to evoke\nthe release of adrenaline.\nEven people taking drugs\nthat increase adrenaline.\nBut then they also did what are\ncalled blocking experiments.\nThey did experiments where they had people\nget into a highly emotional state\nfrom reading highly emotional material,\nor they got people to get\ninto a highly emotional\nneuro chemical state by\nreading boring material\nand then taking a drug\nto increase adrenaline,\nor an ice bath, or a shock.\nAnd then they also administered\na drug called a beta blocker\nto block the affect of adrenaline\nand related chemicals\nin the brain and body.\nAnd what they found is that even\nif people were exposed to\nsomething really emotional\nor had a lot of adrenaline in their system\nbecause they received a drug to increase\nthe amount of adrenaline.\nTwo manipulations that\nnormally would increase memory,\nkeep that in mind.\nIf they gave them a beta blocker,\nwhich reduced the response\nto that adrenaline, right?\nSo no quickening of the heart rate.\nNo quickening of the breathing.\nNo increase in the\nactivity of locus coeruleus\nand these kind of wake up\nsignals to the rest of the brain.\nWell then, the material wasn't\nremembered better at all.\nWhat this tells us is that, yes,\nFrancis Bacon was right.\nMcGaugh and Cahill were right.\nHundreds, if not\nthousands of philosophers,\nand psychologists, and\nneuroscientists were right.\nIn stating and in thinking that\nhigh emotional states\nhelp you learn things.\nBut what McGaugh and Cahill really showed,\nand what's most important to know,\nis that it is the presence\nof high adrenaline,\nhigh amounts of\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\nand perhaps cortisol as\nwell, as you'll soon see,\nthat allows a memory to\nbe stamped down quickly.\nIt is not the emotion.\nIt is the neuro chemical\nstate that you go into\nas a consequence of the emotion.\nAnd it's very important to understand\nthat while those two things are related,\nthey are not one and the same thing.\nBecause what that means\nis that were you to evoke\nthe release of epinephrine,\nnorepinephrine, and cortisol\nor even just one or two of those chemicals\nafter experiencing something,\nyou are stamping down the experience\nthat you just previously had.\nNow this is fundamentally important\nand far and away different than the idea\nthat we remember things because\nthey're important to us,\nor because they evoke emotion.\nThat's true, but the real reason,\nthe neuro chemical reason,\nthe mechanism behind all that\nis these neuro chemicals have the ability\nto strengthen neural connections\nby making them active just once.\nThere's something truly magic about\nthat neuro chemical cocktail that removes\nthe need for repetition.\nOkay, so let's apply this knowledge.\nLet's establish a scientifically\ngrounded set of tools.\nMeaning tools that take into account\nthe identity of the neuro chemicals\nthat are important for enhancing learning\nand the timing of the\nrelease of those chemicals\nin order to enhance learning.\nWhen I first learned about the results\nof McGaugh and Cahill,\nI was just blown away.\nI was also pretty upset,\nbut not with them,\nI was upset with myself.\nBecause I realized that the way that I had\nbeen approaching learning\nand memory was not optimal.\nIn fact, it was probably\nin the opposite direction\nto the enhanced protocol\nfor learning and memory\nthat I'm going to teach you today.\nMy typical mode of\ntrying to learn something\nwhile I was in college, or\nwhile I was in graduate school,\nor as a junior professor,\nor a tenured professor\nwas to sit down to\nwhatever it is I was going\nto try and learn, and\nperhaps even memorize.\nOr if it was a physical\nskill, move to whatever\nenvironment I was going to\nlearn that physical skill in,\nand prior to that, to make sure that I was\nhydrated, because that's important to me.\nAnd certainly can\ncontribute to your brain's\nability to function and your\nbody's ability to function.\nAnd general patterns of alertness.\nBut also, to caffeinate.\nI would have a nice, strong\ncup of coffee or espresso.\nI would have a nice\nstrong cup of yerba mate.\nAnd I still drink coffee or\nyerba mate very regularly.\nI drink them in moderation, I think.\nCertainly for me.\nBut typically I would drink those things\nbefore I would engage\nin any kind of attempt\nto learn or memorize.\nOr to acquire a new skill.\nNow caffeine in the form\nof coffee or yerba mate\nor any other form of caffeine does create\na sense of alertness in our brain and body\nand it does that through\ntwo major mechanisms.\nThe first mechanism is by\nblocking the effects of adenosine.\nAdenosine is a molecule that builds up\nin the brain and body the\nlonger that we are awake.\nAnd it's largely what's responsible\nfor our feelings of sleepiness and fatigue\nwhen we've been awake\nfor a very long time.\nCaffeine essentially acts to block\nthe effects of adenosine.\nIt's a competing agonist,\nnot to get technical,\nbut it binds to the receptor for adenosine\nfor some period of time\nand prevents adenosine\nfrom having its normal pattern of action.\nAnd thereby reduces our\nfeelings of fatigue.\nBut it also increases state of alertness.\nSo while it's reducing fatigue,\nit's also pushing on\nneuro chemical systems\nin order to directly\nincrease our alertness.\nAnd it does that in\nlarge part by increasing\nthe transmission of\nepinephrine, adrenaline,\nin the brain and body.\nIt also has this interesting\neffect of up regulating\nthe number and or efficiency,\nor we say the efficacy,\nof dopamine receptors.\nSuch that when dopamine is present,\nand is a molecule that\nincreases motivation,\nand craving, and pursuit, that dopamine\ncan have a more potent effect\nthan it would otherwise.\nSo caffeine really hits\nthese three systems.\nIt hits other systems too,\nbut it mainly reduces fatigue\nby reducing adenosine, increases alertness\nby increasing epinephrine release,\nor adrenaline release I should say,\nboth from the adrenals in your body\nand form locus coeruleus\nfrom within the brain.\nAnd it can, in parallel\nto all that, increase\nthe action or the efficacy\nof the action of dopamine.\nSo my typical way of\napproaching learning and memory\nwould be to drink some caffeine\nand then focus really hard\non whatever it is that\nI'm trying to learn.\nTry and eliminate distractions\nand then hope, hope, hope.\nOr try, try, try to\nremember that information\nas best as I could.\nAnd frankly, I felt like it\nwas working pretty well for me.\nAnd typically, if I leveraged other forms\nof pharmacology in order to\nenhance learning and memory,\nthings like Alpha GPC,\nor phosphatidyl serine,\nI would do that by taking those things\nbefore I sat down to learn\na particular set of information.\nOr before I went off to learn\na particular physical skill.\nNow, for those of you out\nthere listening to this\nyou're probably thinking, well, okay.\nThe results of McGaugh and Cahill pointed\nto the fact that having\nadrenaline released after\nlearning something enhanced\nlearning of that thing.\nBut a lot of these things like caffeine,\nor Alpha GPC can increase\nepinephrine and adrenaline\nor dopamine or other molecules\nin the brain and body\nthat can enhance memory\nfor a long period of time.\nSo it makes sense to take it first,\nor even during learning,\nand then allow that increase to occur.\nAnd the increase will occur over\na long period of time and will\nenhance learning and memory.\nAnd while that is partially true,\nit is not entirely true.\nAnd it turns out it's not optimal.\nWork that was done by\nthe McGaugh laboratory,\nand in other laboratories evaluated\nthe precise temporal relationship\nbetween neuro chemical\nactivation of these pathways\nand learning and memory.\nWhat they did is they had\nanimals and or people,\ndepending on the experiment, take a drug.\nIt could be caffeine.\nIt could be in pill form.\nSomething that would increase adrenaline\nor related molecules that create\nthis state of alertness that\nare related to emotionality.\nAnd they had them do it\neither an hour before,\n30 minutes before, 10 minutes before,\nor five minutes before learning,\nor during the about of learning, right?\nThe reading of the\ninformation or the performing\nof the skill that one is trying to learn.\nOr five minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes,\n30 minutes, etc. afterwards.\nSo they looked very\nprecisely at when exactly\nis best to evoke this adrenaline release.\nAnd it turns out that the best time window\nto evoke the release of these chemicals,\nif the goal is to enhance\nlearning and memory\nof the material is\neither immediately after\nor just a few minutes,\nfive, 10, maybe 15 minutes\nafter you're repeating that information.\nYou're trying to learn that information.\nAgain, this could be cognitive information\nor this could be a physical skill.\nNow this really spits in the face\nof the way that most of us\napproach learning and memory.\nMost of us, if we use\nstimulants like caffeine\nor Alpha GPC, we're taking those before\nor during an attempt to\nlearn, not afterwards.\nThese results point to the fact that\nit is after the learning and memory\nthat you really want to\nget that big increase\nin epinephrine and the related molecules\nthat will tamp down memory.\nSo what this means is that\nif you are currently using\ncaffeine or other compounds,\nand we'll talk about what those are\nand safety issues and\nso forth in a moment.\nIf you're using those compounds in order\nto enhance learning and memory\nby taking them before or\nduring a learning episode,\nwell then I encourage you to try\nand take them either late\nin the learning episode\nor immediately after the learning episode.\nNow given everything I've\ntold you up until now\nwhy would I say late\nin the learning episode\nor immediately after?\nWell, when you ingest\nsomething by drinking it\nor you take it in capsule form,\nthere's a period of time before that gets\nabsorbed into the body.\nAnd different substances,\nsuch as caffeine, Alpha GPC, etc\nare absorbed from the gut\nand into the blood stream\nand reach the brain and\ntrigger these affects\nin the brain and body at different rates.\nSo it's not instantaneous.\nSome have effects within minutes,\nothers within tens of minutes and so on.\nIt's really going to depend\non the pharmacology of those things\nand it's also going to depend\non whether or not you\nhave food in your gut,\nwhat else you happen to have circulating\nin your blood stream, etc.\nBut at a very basic level\nwe can confidently say\nthat there are not one, not dozens,\nbut as I mentioned before,\nhundreds of studies in\nanimals and in humans\nthat point to the fact that triggering\nthe increase of adrenaline\nlate in learning\nor immediately after learning\nis going to be most beneficial\nif your goal is to retain that information\nfor some period of time.\nAnd to reduce the number of repetitions\nrequired in order to\nlearn that information.\nNow, I want to acknowledge that\non previous episodes of this podcast\nand in appearing on other podcasts,\nI've talked a lot about things\nlike non-sleep deep rest,\nand naps, and sleep as vital\nto the learning process.\nAnd I want to emphasize\nthat none of that information has changed.\nI don't look at any of that\ninformation differently\nas the consequence of what\nI'm talking about today.\nIt is still true that the strengthening\nof connections in the brain,\nthe literal neural plasticity,\nthe changing of the circuits occurs\nduring deep sleep and non-sleep deep rest.\nAnd it is also true,\nand I've mentioned these results earlier\nthat two papers were\npublished in Cell Reports,\nCell Press journal, excellent journal\nover the last few years showing that\nbrief naps of about 20 up to 90 minutes\nin some period of time\nafter an attempt to learn\ncan enhance the rate\nof learning and memory.\nHowever, those bouts of sleep,\nthe deep sleep that night, I should say,\nor those brief naps,\nor even the so-called NSDR as we call it,\nnon-sleep deep rest that was used\nto enhance the learning and memory\nof particular pieces of information.\nEither cognitive or physical\ninformation or both.\nThat still can be performed,\nbut it can be performed some hours later,\neven an hour later.\nIt can be performed two hours\nlater or four hours later.\nRemember, it's in these\nnaps and in deep sleep\nthat the actual reconfiguration\nof the neural circuits occurs,\nthe strengthening of those\nneural circuits occurs.\nIt is not the case that you need to finish\na about of learning and drop\nimmediately into a nap or sleep.\nSome people might do that,\nbut if you're really trying to optimize\nand enhance and improve your memory,\nthe data from McGaugh and Cahill\nand many other laboratories\nthat stemmed out\nfrom their initial work really point\nto the fact that the\nideal protocol would be\nfocus on the thing you're\ntrying to learn very intensely.\nThere are also some other\nthings like error rates, etc.\nPlease see our episodes on learning.\nWe have a newsletter\non how to learn better.\nYou can access that at HubermanLab.com.\nIt's a zero cost newsletter.\nYou can grab that PDF.\nIt lists out the things to\ndo during the learning about.\nStill try and get excellent sleep.\nAgain, fundamentally\nimportant for mental health,\nphysical health, and performance.\nAnd we can now extend from performance\nto saying including learning and memory.\nNap if it doesn't interrupt\nyour nighttime sleep.\nNaps of anywhere from 10 to 90 minutes.\nOr non-sleep deep rest protocols\nwill enhance learning and memory,\nbut we can now add to that,\nthat spiking adrenaline\nprovided it can be done in a safe way,\nis going to reduce the\nnumber of repetitions\nrequired to learn.\nAnd that should be done\nat the very tail end\nor immediately after a learning about.\nWhich is compatible with all\nthe other protocols that I mentioned.\nAnd the reason I'm revisiting this stuff\nabout sleep and non-sleep deep rest\nis I think that some\npeople got the impression\nthat they need to do that\nimmediately after learning\nand today I'm saying to the contrary.\nImmediately after learning\nyou need to go into\na heightened state of\nemotionality and alertness.\nNow it's vitally important to point out\nthat you do not need pharmacology.\nYou don't need caffeine.\nYou don't need Alpha GPC.\nYou don't need any pharmacologic substance\nto spike adrenaline\nunless that's something\nthat you already are doing.\nOr that you can do safely.\nOr that you know you can do safely.\nAnd I always say, and I'll say it again,\nI'm not a physician so I'm\nnot prescribing anything.\nI'm a professor, so I profess things.\nYou need to what's safe for you.\nSo if you're somebody who's\nnot used to drinking caffeine\nand you suddenly drink\nfour espresso after trying\nto learn something, you are going to have\na severe increase in alertness\nand probably even anxiety.\nIf you're panic attack prone,\nplease don't start taking stimulants\nin order to learn things better.\nPlease be safe.\nI don't just say that to protect me,\nI say that to protect you.\nAnd I should mention that if you're\nnot accustomed to taking something,\nyou always want to first check\nwith your doctor, of course,\nbut also move into that gradually, right?\nStart with the lowest effective dose.\nThe minimal effective dose.\nAnd sometimes the minimal effective dose\nis zero milligrams, it's nothing.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, we already talked\nabout results where\nthey put people's arms into an ice bath\nin order to evoke adrenaline release.\nYou are welcome to do that if you want.\nIn fact, that's a pretty\nlow cost, zero pharmacology.\nAt least exogenous pharmacology way\nto approach this whole thing.\nThat's a way of evoking\nyour own natural epinephrine\nthat turns out also dopamine release.\nYou could take a cold shower.\nYou could do an ice bath or get into\na cold circulating bath.\nWe've done several episodes\non the utility of cold for\nhealth and performance.\nYou can find those episodes\nat HubermanLab.com.\nAlso the episode with\nmy colleague at Stanford\nfrom the biology department,\nDr. Craig Heller.\nLots of protocols, in\nparticular in the episode\non cold for health and performance.\nThat describe how best to use\nthe cold shower or the ice bath\nor the circulating cold bath\nin order to evoke epinephrine\nand dopamine release.\nThe point is that the time in which\nyou would want to do those protocols\nis after, ideally immediately\nafter your learning about.\nMeaning when you're sitting down to learn\nnew information or after trying\nto learn some new physical skill.\nNow whether or not that's compatible\nwith the other reasons you're doing\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nand whether or not that's compatible\nwith the other things you're doing,\nthat depends on the\ncontour of your lifestyle,\nyour training, your academic goals,\nyour learning goals, etc.\nBut if your specific purpose is to enhance\nlearning and memory, you want\nto spike adrenaline afterwards.\nAnd so what I'm telling\nyou is you can do that\nwith caffeine.\nYou can do that with Alpha GPC.\nYou can do that with a combination\nof caffeine and Alpha GPC.\nIf you can do that safely.\nSome of you I know are using\nother forms of pharmacology.\nI did a long episode all about ADHD.\nI have to just really declare\nmy stance very clearly\nthat I am not a fan, I am actually opposed\nto people using prescription drugs\nwho are not prescribed those drugs\nin order to enhance alertness.\nI think there's a big addictive potential.\nThere also is a potential to really\ndisrupt one's own pharmacology around\nthe dopaminergic system.\nHowever, some of you I know are prescribed\nthings like ritalin,\nAdderall and modafinil\nand things of that sort in order\nto increase alertness and focus.\nSo for those of you that are prescribed\nthose things from a board\ncertified physician,\nyou're going to have to decide\nif you're going to take\nthem before trying to learn\nor after trying to learn.\nYou also have to take into consideration\nthat some of those drugs\nare very long acting.\nSome are shorter acting.\nAnd time that according\nto what you're trying to learn and when.\nSo that's pharmacology.\nBut as I mentioned, there\nare the behavioral protocols.\nYou can use cold and cold\nis an excellent stimulus\nbecause first of all, it\ndoesn't involve pharmacology.\nSecond of all, you can generally access it\nat low to zero cost, especially\nthe cold shower approach.\nAnd third, you can titrate it.\nYou can start with warmer water.\nYou can make it very, very\ncold if that's your thing\nand you're able to tolerate that safely.\nYou can make it moderately cold.\nHow cold should it be in order\nto invoke adrenaline release?\nWell, it should be uncomfortably cold\nbut cold enough that you feel like\nyou really want to get out,\nbut can stay in safely.\nThat's going to evoke adrenaline release.\nIf it quickens your breathing,\nif it makes you go wide eyed.\nThat's increasing adrenaline release.\nIn fact, those effects of going wide eyed\nand quickening of the breathing\nand the challenges in thinking clearly,\nthose are the direct effects of adrenaline\non your brain and body.\nAnd of course, there are other ways\nto increase adrenaline.\nYou could go out for a hard run.\nYou could do any number of things\nthat would increase\nadrenaline in your body.\nWhich things you choose is up to you,\nbut from a very clear, solid grounding\nin research data, we can confidently say\nthat spiking adrenaline after interacting\nwith some material, physical\nor cognitive material\nthat you're trying to learn,\nis going to be the best time\nto spike that adrenaline.\nNow I realize I'm being\na bit redundant today\nor perhaps a lot redundant.\nIn repeating over and over that\nthe increase in epinephrine should occur\neither very late in an\nattempt to learn something\nor immediately after an\nattempt to learn something.\nI also want to emphasize\nthe general contour\nof pharmacologic effects\nand of behavioral tools\nto create adrenaline.\nWhat do I mean by that sentence?\nWhat I mean is that McGaugh and colleagues\nexplored a huge number\nof different compounds and approaches.\nEverything from the hand into the ice bath\nto injecting adrenaline, to caffeine,\nto drugs that block the affects\nof adrenaline and caffeine.\nDrugs like muscimol and picrotoxin.\nPlease don't take those.\nThese are drugs that reduce\nor enhance the amount of adrenaline\nand the overall takeaway is that anything\nthat increases adrenaline will increase\nlearning and memory and will reduce\nthe number of repetitions\nrequired to learn something.\nRegardless of whether\nor not that something\nhas an emotional intensity or not.\nProvided that spike in\nadrenaline occurs late\nin the learning or immediately after.\nAnd anything that reduces\nepinephrine and adrenaline\nwill impair learning.\nAnd that's the key and\nnovel piece of information\nthat I'm adding now.\nWhich is if you're taking\nbeta blockers, for instance.\nOr if you're trying to learn something\nand it's not evoking much\nof an emotional response,\nand you're not using any pharmacology\nor other methods to\nenhance adrenaline release\nafter learning that thing, well,\nyou're not going to learn it very well.\nIn fact, McGaugh and Cahill\ndid beautiful experiments\nin humans looking at how much adrenaline\nis increased by varying\nthe emotional intensity\nof different things that they were trying\nto get people to learn.\nOr by changing the dosage of epinephrine.\nOr by changing the amount\nof epinephrine blocker\nthat they injected.\nLots and lots of studies.\nThe key thing to take\naway from those studies\nis that for some people, adrenaline\nwas increased 600 to 700%.\nSo six to seven fold over baseline\nin the amount of circulating\nepinephrine or adrenaline.\nAnd keep in mind, sometimes that increase\nwas due to the actual thing\nthey were trying to learn\nbeing very emotional,\npositive or negative emotion.\nAnd sometimes it was\nbecause they were using\na pharmacologic approach\nor the ice bath approach.\nI don't think they ever\nused a cold shower approach,\nbut that would have been\na very effective one\nwe can be sure.\nHowever, other people had\na zero to 10% increase.\nSo a very small increase in epinephrine.\nWhat we can confidently say on the basis\nof all those data is that\nthe more epinephrine release,\nthe better that people\nremembered the material.\nOver and over again this was shown.\nWhether or not it was\nfor cognitive material,\nso learning a language,\nlearning a passage of words,\nlearning mathematics.\nOr whether or not it was\nfor physical learning.\nI want to emphasize something\nabout physical learning\nbecause I know a number\nof you are probably\ndrinking a cup of coffee or having\na cup of yerba mate or\nmaybe even an energy drink\nand taking some Alpha GPC or something\nbefore physical exercise.\nI'm not saying that's a bad thing to do\nor you wouldn't want to do that.\nBut that's really to increase alertness.\nIt won't enhance learning,\nat least not as well as\ndoing those things after\nthe physical exercise.\nNow again, many of you, including myself,\nexercise for the sake\nof the physical benefits\nof that exercise.\nSo cardiovascular, resistance training.\nBut we're not really focused\non learning and memory.\nSo, I emphasize this just so it's\nimmensely clear to everybody.\nIf you want to use those approaches\nof increasing adrenaline prior to\nor during physical training,\nor cognitive work for\nthat matter, be my guest.\nI think that's perfectly fine,\nprovided that's safe for you.\nIt's only by moving it to late\nor after the learning that\nyou're really shifting\nthe role of that adrenaline increase\nto enhancing memory specifically.\nAnd as a cautionary note, don't think\nthat you can push this entire system\nto the extreme over and over again,\nor chronically, as we\nsay, and get away with it.\nIn other words, you're\nnot going to be able\nto take a Alpha GPC and a double espresso\ndo your focus about of work,\ncognitive or physical work,\nand then spike adrenaline again afterwards\nand remember that stuff\nyou did better, right.\nI'm not encouraging you, in\nfact I'm discouraging you\nfrom chronically increasing adrenaline\nboth during and after\na given about of work\nif the goal is to learn.\nWhy do I say that?\nWell, work from McGaugh\nand Cahill and others\nhas shown that it's\nnot the absolute amount\nof adrenaline that you release\nin your brain and body that\nmatters for enhancing memory.\nIt's the amount of adrenaline you release\nrelative to the amount of adrenaline\nthat was in your system just prior.\nParticularly in the hour or two prior.\nSo again, it's the delta, as we say.\nIt's the difference.\nSo if you're going to\nchronically increase adrenaline\nyou're not going to learn as well.\nThe real key is to have\nadrenaline modestly low.\nPerhaps even just as much as you need\nin order to be able to focus on something,\npay attention to it, and\nthen spike it afterwards.\nThis is immensely important because\nwhile much of what we're talking about\nis actually a form of inducing\na neuro chemical acute stress.\nMeaning a brief and rapid onset of stress.\nWell, chronic stress,\nthe chronic elevation\nof epinephrine and cortisol\nis actually detrimental to learning.\nAnd there's an entire\ncategory of literature\nmainly from the work of the great\nand sadly the late Bruce McEwen\nfrom the Rockefeller University.\nAnd some of his scientific offspring\nlike the great Robert Sapolsky,\nshowing that chronic stress,\nchronic elevation of epinephrine\nactually inhibits learning and memory.\nAnd also can inhibit\nimmune system function.\nWhereas acute, right, sharp increases\nin adrenaline and cortisol\nactually can enhance learning\nand indeed, can enhance the immune system.\nSo if you really want to\nleverage this information,\nyou might consider getting\nyour brain and body\ninto a very calm and yet alert state.\nSo a high attentional state\nthat will allow you to focus on what it is\nthat you're trying to learn.\nWe know focus is vital\nfor encoding information\nand for triggering neuroplasticity.\nBut remaining calm throughout that time\nand then afterwards spiking adrenaline\nand allowing adrenaline to\nhave these incredible effects\non reducing the number of repetitions\nrequired to learn.\nSo if you're like me, you're\nlearning about this information\nthis beautiful work of\nMcGaugh and Cahill and others\nand thinking, wow, I\nshould perhaps consider\nspiking my adrenaline\nin one form or another\nat the tail end or immediately following\nan attempt to learn something.\nAnd yet, we are not the first\nto have this conversation.\nNor were McGaugh and Cahill\nor any other researchers\nthat I've discussed today\nthe first to start using this technique.\nIn fact, there is a beautiful review\nthat was published just\nthis year, May of 2022\nin the journal Neuron, Cell Press Journal.\nExcellent journal.\nCalled Mechanisms of Memory Under Stress.\nAnd I just want to read to you\nthe first opening paragraph\nof this review, which\nis, as the name suggests,\nall about memory and stress.\nSo here I'm reading, and I quote,\n\"In Medieval times communities threw\"\n\"young children in the river when\"\n\"they wanted them to\nremember important events.\"\n\"They believed that throwing\na child in the water\"\n\"after witnessing historic proceedings\"\n\"would leave a life long memory\"\n\"for the events in the child.\"\nBelieve it or not, this is true.\nThis is a practice that\nsomehow people arrived at.\nI don't know if they were\naware of what adrenaline was.\nProbably not.\nBut somehow in medieval times\nit was understood that spiking adrenaline\nor creating a robust emotional experience\nafter an experience that one\nhoped a child would learn\nwould encourage the\nchild's nervous system,\nthey didn't even know\nwhat a nervous system was,\nbut would encourage the brain and body\nof that child to remember\nthose particular events.\nVery counter intuitive if you ask me.\nI would have thought that\nthe kid would remember\nonly being thrown into the river.\nMy guess is that they remember that,\nbut the idea here anyway,\nis they also remember\nthe things that preceded\nbeing thrown into the river.\nSo both interesting and amusing\nand somewhat, I should say\nthought stimulating, really.\nThat this is a practice\nthat has been going on\nfor many hundreds of years.\nAnd we are not the first to start thinking\nabout using cold water as\nan adrenaline stimulus.\nNor are we the first\nto start thinking about\nusing cold water induced adrenaline\nas a way to enhance learning and memory.\nThis has been happening\nsince medieval times.\nSo up until now I've been talking about\npretty broad contour of these experiments.\nI've been talking about the\nunderlying pharmacology,\nthe role of epinephrine and so forth.\nI haven't really talked a lot about\nthe underlying neural mechanisms.\nSo we're just going to\ntake a minute or two\nand describe those for you\nbecause they are informative.\nWe all have a brain structure\ncalled the amygdala.\nA lot of people think\nit's associated with fear\nbut it's actually associated\nwith threat detection\nand more generally, and I\nshould say more specifically,\nwith detecting what sorts of events\nin the environment are\nnovel and are linked\nto particular emotional states.\nBoth positive emotional states\nand negative emotional states.\nSo the neurons in the\namygdala are exquisitely good\nat figuring out, right, they\ndon't have their own mind\nbut at detecting correlations between\nsensory events in the environment\nthat trigger the release of adrenaline\nand what's going on in the brain.\nAnd because the amygdala is so extensively\ninterconnected with\nother areas of the brain.\nIt basically connects to everything\nand everything connects back to it.\nThe amygdala is in a\nposition to strengthen\nparticular connections\nin the brain very easily.\nProvided certain conditions are met.\nAnd those conditions are the ones\nwe've been talking about up until now.\nEmotional saliency that\nresults in increases\nin epinephrine and cortisol.\nOr circulating epinephrine and cortisol\nbeing much higher than it was 10 minutes\nor 15 minutes before.\nAnd the net effect of the amygdala\nin this context is to\ntake whatever patterns\nof neural activity preceded that increase\nin adrenaline and corticosterone\nand strengthen those\nsynapses that were involved\nin that neural activity.\nSo the amygdala doesn't have knowledge.\nIt's not a thinking area.\nIt's a correlation detector.\nAnd it's correlating neural chemical\nstates of the brain and body,\ndifferent patterns of electrical\nactivity in the brain.\nThis is important because\nit really emphasizes\nthe fact that both negative\nand positive emotional states\nand the different but somewhat overlapping\nchemical states that they create,\nor the conditions, as we say the and gates\nthrough which memory is laid down.\nAnd gates will be familiar to those\nof you who have done a bit\nof a computer programming.\nAn and gate is simply a condition\nin which you need one\nthing and another to happen\nin order for a third thing to happen.\nSo you need epinephrine\nelevated and you need\nrobust activity in a\nparticular brain circuit\nif in fact that brain circuit\nis going to be strengthened.\nIt's not sufficient to have one\nor the other, you need both.\nHence, the name and gate.\nAnd the amygdala is very\ngood at establishing\nthese and gate contingencies.\nIt's also a very generic brain structure\nin the sense that it doesn't really care\nwhat sorts of sensory events are involved\nprovided they correlated in time\nwith that increase in\nadrenal and corticosterone.\nThis has a wonderful side\nand a kind of dark side.\nThe dark side is that PTSD and traumas\nof various kinds often involve an increase\nin adrenaline because whatever it was\nthat caused the PTSD was\nindeed very stressful.\nCaused these big increases\nin these chemicals.\nAnd because the amygdala is\nrather general in its functions.\nRight, it's not tuned or designed\nin any kind of way to\nbe specifically active\nin response to particular types\nof sensory events, or perceptions.\nWell, then what it means is that\nwe can start to become afraid\nof entire city blocks where\none bad thing happened\nin a particular room of\na particular building\nin a city block.\nWe can become fearful of\nanyplace that contains\na lot of people if\nsomething bad happened to us\nin a place that contained a lot of people.\nThe amygdala is not so much of a splitter,\nas we say in science.\nWe talk about lumpers and splitters.\nLumpers are kind of generalizers,\nif that's even a word.\nAnd I think it is, someone will tell me\none way or the other.\nAnd splitters are people\nthat are ultra precise\nand specific and nuanced\nabout every little detail.\nThe amygdala is more of\na lumper than a splitter\nwhen it comes to sensory events.\nOther areas of the\nbrain only become active\nunder very, very specific conditions\nand only those conditions.\nAnd similarly, epinephrine\nis just a molecule.\nIt's just a chemical that's circulating\nin our brain and body.\nThere's no epinephrine specifically for\na cold shower that is\ndistinct from the epinephrine\nassociated with a bad event\nwhich is distinct from the epinephrine\nassociated with a really exciting event\nthat makes you really alert.\nEpinephrine is just a\nmolecule, it's generic.\nSo these systems have a lot of overlap\nand that can explain, in large part,\nwhy when good things happen\nin particular locations\nand in the company of particular people,\nwe often generalize to large categories\nof people, places, and things.\nAnd when negative things happen\nin particular circumstances,\nwe often generalize about\npeople places and things\nassociated with that negative event.\nSo now I'd like to talk about other tools\nthat you can leverage that have been shown\nin quality, peer-reviewed studies\nto enhance learning and memory.\nAnd perhaps one of the most potent\nof those tools is exercise.\nThere are numerous studies on this\nin both animals and\nfortunately now also in humans.\nThanks to the beautiful work\nof people like Wendy Suzuki\nfrom New York University.\nWendy's lab has identified\nhow exercise works\nto enhance learning and memory\nand other forms of\ncognition, I should mention.\nAs well as things that can augment,\ncan enhance the effects of exercise\non learning and memory and\nother forms of cognition.\nWendy is going to be a\nguest on this podcast.\nIt's actually the episode\nthat follows this episode.\nAnd it includes a lot of material\nthat we have not covered today.\nAnd she's an incredible scientist\nand has some incredible findings\nthat I know everyone is going\nto find immensely useful.\nIn the meantime, I want to talk about some\nof the general effects\nof exercise on learning\nand memory that she's discovered\nand that other laboratories\nhave discovered.\nIf you recall earlier, I mentioned\nthat learning and memory\nalmost always involves\nthe strengthening of particular synapses\nand neural circuits in the brain.\nAnd not so much the increase in the number\nof neurons in the brain.\nThere is one exception, however.\nAnd we now have both animal\ndata and some human data\nto support the fact that\ncardiovascular exercise\nseems to increase what we call\ndentate gyrus neurogenesis.\nNeurogenesis is the\ncreation of new neurons.\nThe dentate gyrus is a\nsubregion of the hippocampus\nthat's involved in learning and memory\nof particular kinds.\nRight, certain types of events,\nparticular contextual learning,\nbut some other things as well.\nSometimes involved in spacial learning.\nThere's a lot debate about exactly what\nthe dentate gyrus does, but for the sake\nof this discussion, and I think everyone\nin the neuroscience community would agree\nthat the dentate gyrus is important\nfor memory formation and consolidation.\nThe dentate gyrus does seem\nto be one region in the brain,\ncertainly in the rodent brain,\nbut more and more it's seeming\nalso in the human brain\nwhere at least some new neurons\nare added throughout the lifespan.\nAnd, as it turns out, that\ncardiovascular exercise\ncan increase the proliferation\nof new neurons in this structure.\nAnd that those new neurons, excuse me,\nare important for the formation\nof certain types of new memories.\nThere are wonderful data showing that\nif you use X-irradiation, which is a way\nto eliminate the formation\nof those new cells\nor other tools and tricks to eliminate\nthe formation of those cells\nthat you block the\nformation of certain kinds\nof learning and memory.\nWhat does this mean?\nWell, there are a lot of\nreasons for the statement\nI'm about to make that extend far beyond\nneurogenesis and the\nhippocampus learning and memory.\nBut it's very clear that getting anywhere\nfrom 180, or I should say a minimum\nof 180 to 200 minutes\nof so called zone two\ncardiovascular exercise, so\nthis is cardiovascular exercise\nthat can be performed\nat a pretty steady state\nwhich would allow you to just\nbarely hold a conversation.\nSo breathing hard but not super hard.\nSuch as in sprints or high\nintensity interval training.\nBut doing that for 180 to\n200 minutes per week total\nis it appears the minimum threshold\nfor enhancing some of\nthe longevity effects\nassociated with improvements\nin cardiovascular fitness\nand we believe that it is indirectly,\nI should say indirectly,\nthrough enhancements\nin cardiovascular fitness\nthat there are improvements\nin hippocampal dentate gyrus neurogenesis.\nWhat does that mean?\nThe improvements in\ncardiovascular function\nare indirectly impacting the ability\nof the dentate gyrus to\ncreate these new neurons.\nTo my knowledge there's\nno direct relationship\nbetween exercise and stimulating\nthe production of new\nneurons in the brain.\nIt seems that it's the\nimprovement in blood flow\nthat also relate to improvements\nin things like lymphatic flow,\nthe circulation of lymph\nfluid within the brain\nthat are enhancing neurogenesis\nand that neurogenesis,\nit appears is important.\nNow in fairness to the\nlandscape of neuroscience\nand my colleagues at\nStanford and elsewhere.\nThere is a lot of debate\nas to whether or not\nthere is much if any neurogenesis\nin the adult human brain.\nBut regardless, I think\nthe data are quite clear\nthat the 180 to 200 minutes minimum\nof cardiovascular exercise\nis going to be important\nfor other health metrics.\nNow it is clear that\nexercise can impact learning\nand memory through other non-neurogenesis,\nnon-neuron type mechanisms.\nAnd one of the more exciting ones\nthat has been studied over the years\nis this notion of hormones\nfrom bone traveling\nin the blood stream to the brain\nand enhancing the function\nof the hippocampus.\nIf the words hormones from\nbones is surprising to you,\nI'm here to tell you that yes, indeed,\nyour bones make hormones.\nWe call these endocrine effects.\nSo in biology we hear\nabout autocrine, paracrine,\nand endocrine.\nThose different terms\nrefer to over what distance\na given chemical has an affect on a cell.\nFor instance, a cell can\nhave an affect on itself.\nIt can have an affect on\nimmediately neighboring cells\nor it can have an affect on both itself,\nimmediately neighboring\ncells and cells far,\nfar away in the body.\nAnd that last example of a given chemical\nor substance having and affect\non the cell that produced it\nplus neighboring cells,\nplus cells far away\nis an endocrine effect.\nAnd a lot of hormones, not\nall, work in this fashion.\nHence why we sometimes hear\nabout endocrine and hormone\nas kind of synonymous terms.\nYour bones make chemicals that\ntravel in the blood stream\nand have these endocrine effects.\nSo they're effectively acting as hormones.\nAnd one such chemical is\nsomething called osteocalcin.\nNow these findings arrived\nto us through various labs\nbut one of the more important labs\nfor the sake of this discussion today\nis the laboratory of Eric Kandel\nat Columbia Medical School.\nEric is now, I believe\nin his mid to late 90s,\nstill very sharp.\nAnd has studied learning and memory.\nIt also turns out that\nhe is an avid swimmer.\nNow, I happen to know\nthat Eric swims anywhere\nfrom a half a mile to a mile a day.\nAnd again, this is anecdotal.\nI'm not referring to the\npublished data just yet.\nBut he credits that\nexercise as one of the ways\nin which he keeps his brain sharp\nand has indeed kept his brain sharp\nfor many, many decades.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nhe's well into his 90s.\nSo pretty impressive.\nHis laboratory has studied the effects\nof exercise on hippocampal\nfunction and memory.\nAnd other laboratories\nhave done that as well.\nAnd what they've found is\nthat cardiovascular exercise\nand perhaps other forms of exercise too,\nbut mainly cardiovascular exercise creates\nthe release of osteocalcin from the bones\nthat travels to the\nbrain and to sub regions\nof the hippocampus and encourages\nthe electrical activity and\nformation and maintenance\nof connections within the hippocampus\nand keeps the hippocampus functioning well\nin order to lay down new memories.\nNow osteocalcin has a lot of effects\nbesides just improving the\nfunction of the hippocampus.\nOsteocalcin is involved\nin bone growth itself.\nIt's involved in hormone regulation.\nIn fact, there's really nice evidence\nthat it can regulate testosterone\nand estrogen production\nby the testes and ovaries.\nAnd a bunch of other effects\nin other organs of the body.\nBecause again, it's acting\nin this endocrine manner.\nIt's arriving from bone to a lot\nof different organs to have effects.\nLoad bearing exercise, in particular,\nturns out to be important for inducing\nthe release of osteocalcin.\nAnd when you think about\nthis, it makes sense.\nA nervous system exists\nfor a lot of reasons,\nto sense, perceive, etc.\nYou've got taste, you've got smell,\nyou've got hearing.\nBut the vast majority\nof brain real estate,\nespecially in humans, is\ndedicated to two things.\nOne, vision.\nWe have an enormous amount\nof brain real estate devoted to vision.\nCertainly compared to other senses.\nAnd to movement.\nThe ability to generate\ncourse movements of the body.\nThe ability, excuse me,\nto generate fine movements\nof the body, like the digits,\nor to wink one eye, or to tilt your head\nin a particular way, or move your lips\nand move your face and do\nall sorts of different things\nin a very nuanced and detailed way.\nSo much of our brain real estate\nis devoted to movement\nthat it's been hypothesized\nfor more than a half century,\nbut especially in recent years\nas we've learned more about the function\nof the brain in a really\ndetailed circuit level,\nthat the relationship\nbetween the brain and body\nand the maintenance and perhaps even\nthe improvement of the\nneural circuitry in the brain\ndepends on our body\nmovements and the signal\nfrom the body that our\nbrain is still moving.\nSo think about that.\nHow would your brain know if your body\nwas moving regularly and how would it know\nhow much it was moving?\nHow would it know which\nlimbs it was moving?\nWell, you could say, if the heart rate\nis increased then the blood\nflow will be increased\nand then the brain will know.\nAh, but how does your brain know\nthat its increased blood\nflow due to movement\nand not to, for instance,\njust stress, right?\nMaybe you actually can't move\nand you're very stressed about that\nand so the increased blood flow\nis simply a consequence\nof increased stress.\nThe fact that osteocalcin\nis released from bone\nand in particular can be released\nin response to load bearing exercise.\nSo this would be running,\nagain weightlifting\nhasn't been tested directly,\nbut one would imagine\nanything that involves\njumping and landing, or weightlifting,\nor body weight movements\nand things of that sort.\nThat's a signal to release osteocalcin,\nand we know that signal occurs.\nThat is directly reflective\nof the fact that the body was moving\nand moving in particular ways.\nIn fact, you could imagine that big bones\nlike your femur are going\nto release more osteocalcin\nor be in a position to\nrelease more osteocalcin\nthen fine movements like\nthe movements of the digits.\nAnd this idea that the body is constantly\nsignaling to the brain about the status\nof the body and the\nvarying needs of the brain\nto update its brain circuitry,\nis a really attractive\nidea that fits entirely\nwith the biology of exercise, osteocalcin,\nand hippocampal function.\nI do want to mention that I'm not\nthe first to raise this hypothesis.\nThis hypothesis actually was discussed\nin a fair amount of detail by John Ratey\nwho's a professor at\nHarvard Medical School.\nHe wrote a book called, \"Spark\"\nwhich was one of the early books\nat least from an academic\nabout brain plasticity\nand the relationship between exercise\nand movement and plasticity.\nAnd John, who I have the\ngood fortune to know,\nhas described to me experiments,\nor I should say observations of species\nof ocean dwelling animals that have,\nat least for the early part of their life,\na very robust and\ncomplicated nervous system.\nBut then these particular animals\nare in the habit of\nplopping down unto a rock.\nThey find kind of a safe, comfy space\nand they actually stick to that rock\nand they don't move anymore\nfor a certain portion,\nI should say the later\nportion of their life.\nAnd it is at the transition\nbetween moving a lot\nand being stationary that those animals\nactually digest their own brain.\nThe literally metabolize a good portion\nof their nervous system\nbecause they decide, oh,\ndon't need this anymore.\nAnd gobble it up, use it\nfor its nutritional value\nand then sit there like a\nmoron version of themselves\nwith a limited amount of brain tissue\nbecause they don't need to move anymore.\nNow, I certainly don't\nwant to give the message\nthat just moving, just exercise,\nis sufficient to keep\nthe neural architecture\nof your brain healthy,\nyoung, and able to learn.\nWhile that might be true,\nit's also important to actually engage\nin attempts to learn new material.\nEither physical material,\nso new types of movements\nand skills and or new types\nof cognitive information.\nLanguages, mathematics,\nhistory, current events.\nAll sorts of things\nthat involve your brain.\nNonetheless, it's clear\nthat physical movement\nand cognitive ability and the potential\nto enhance cognitive ability\nand the ability to learn\nnew physical skills\nare intimately connected.\nAnd osteocalcin appears\nto be at least one way\nin which that brain-body relationship\nis established and maintained.\nSo given the information about\nosteocalcin and movement,\nand given the information\nabout spiking adrenaline late\nor after a period of an attempt to learn,\nyou might be asking when is\nthe best time to exercise?\nNow unfortunately, that\nhas not been addressed\nin a lot of varying detail,\nwhere every sort of variation on the theme\nhas been carried out.\nAnd yet, Wendy Suzuki's lab has done\nreally beautiful experiments where\nthey have people exercise,\ngenerally it was in the morning.\nBut at other periods of the day as well.\nAnd what they find is\nthat at least as late as\ntwo hours after that exercise,\nthere is an enhancement\nin learning and memory.\nNow I want to be clear, we don't know\nwhether or not that exercise led\nto big increases in adrenaline.\nIt may be that those forms of exercise\nwere modest enough, or didn't\nchallenge people enough\nthat they merely got a\nlot of blood flow going\nand that the improvements in learning\nand memory were related to blood flow\nand we presume increases in osteocalcin.\nHowever, you could imagine a couple\nof different logical protocols based\non what we've talked about.\nLet's say you were going\nto do a form of exercise\nthat was going to spike adrenaline a lot.\nSo this would be exercise\nthat really challenges\nyour system and forces you to kind\nof push through a burn.\nRight, so here I'm mainly thinking about\ncardiovascular exercise.\nBut it could even be yoga,\nit could be resistance training.\nIf it's going to give you a big spike\nin adrenaline, it's going\nto take some serious effort,\nthen logically speaking you\nwould want to place that\nafter a learning about\nin order to increase\nlearning and memory.\nHowever, if you're using the exercise\nin order to enhance blood flow\nand to enhance osteocalcin release.\nIn efforts to augment the\nfunction of your hippocampus,\nI think it stands to reason that doing\nthat exercise sometime within\nthe hour to three hours\npreceding an attempt to learn\nmakes a lot of sense.\nAnd there I'm basing it on the human data\nfrom Wendy Suzuki's lab.\nI'm basing it on the\nstudies from Eric Kandel\nand from others labs.\nAgain, right now, there hasn't been\nan evaluation of a lot\nof different protocols\nto arrive at the peer-reviewed\nlaboratory super protocol.\nHowever, since what we're talking about\nis using activities\nlike exercise that most\nof us probably, perhaps all of us,\nshould be doing regularly anyway.\nAnd I do believe most\nif not all of us should\nregularly be trying to learn\nand keep our brain functioning well\nand acquire new knowledge.\nBecause it's just a\nwonderful part of life.\nAnd there is evidence\nthat actually can keep\nyour brain young, so to speak.\nWell then, exercising either before\nor after a learning about\nmakes a lot of sense.\nWith the emphasis on\nafter a learning about\nif the form of exercise\nspikes a lot of adrenaline\nfor all the reasons we\ntalked about before.\nOkay, so we've talked about two major\ncategories of protocols to improve memory\nthat are grounded in quality,\npeer reviewed science.\nAnd there is yet another third protocol\nthat we'll talk about in a few minutes.\nBut before we do that,\nI want to briefly touch\non an aspect of memory,\nin fact, two aspects of memory\nthat I get a lot of questions about.\nThe first one is photographic memory.\nTo be clear, there are people out there\nwho have a true photographic memory.\nThey can look at a page of text,\nthey can scan it with their eyes,\nand they can essentially\ncommit that to memory\nwith very little if any effort.\nWhile it might seem that\nhaving a photographic memory\nis a very attractive skill to have,\nI should caution you\nagainst believing that\nbecause it turns out that people\nwith true photographic memory\nare often very challenged\nat remembering things that they hear.\nAnd often times are not so good\nat learning physical skills.\nIt's not always the case,\nbut often that's the case.\nSo be careful what you wish for.\nIf you do have a photographic memory\nthere are certain professions\nthat lend themselves\nparticularly well to you.\nAnd indeed a lot of people\nwith photographic memory\nhave to find a profession\nand have to move through life\nin a way that is in concert\nwith that photographic memory.\nSo again, it's a super ability,\nit's a hyper ability and\nyet it's not necessarily one\nthat is desirable for most people.\nThere's also this category\nof what are called\nsuper recognizers.\nThese people are, I should mention,\nhighly employable by government agencies.\nThese are people that have\nan absolutely astonishing\nability to recognize faces and\nto match faces to templates.\nThey can look at a photograph\nof say somebody on a most wanted list\nand then they can look at video footage\nof let's say an airport, or a mall,\nor a city street at fairly low resolution\nand they can spot the person who's face\nmatches that photograph\nthat they looked at.\nEven if that video or other footage\nis of people's profiles or even\nthe tops of their heads and just\na portion of their forehead.\nThese people have just\nan incredible ability\nto recognize faces and to template match.\nAnd again, these people often will take\njobs with agencies where this\nsort of thing is important.\nSome of you out there probably\nare super recognizers and\nmay or may not notice it.\nIf you've ever had the experience\nof watching a movie and\nthought to yourself,\nwow, her mouth looks so\nmuch like my cousin's mouth.\nOr you look at a character in a movie\nor a television show and you think,\nwow, they look almost like the\nyounger sister of so and so.\nWell, then it's very\nlikely that you have this,\nor at least a mild form of\nthis super recognizer ability.\nThat is not memory per se.\nThat is the hyper functioning of an area\nof the brain that we\ncall the fusiform gyrus.\nThe fusiform gyrus is literally\na face recognition area, and\na face template matching area.\nAnd it harbors neurons that\nrespond to faces generally.\nSo as humans and other non-human primates,\nwe care a lot about faces\nand their emotional content.\nAnd the identity of faces\nis super important to us\nfor all the kinds of reasons\nthat are probably obvious.\nKnowing who's friend, who's foe.\nWho do you know well?\nWho's famous, who's not famous?\nEtc.\nThat is not memory, per se.\nAnd yet, if you're a super recognizer,\nor I guess you could call it\na moderate face recognizer\nor not very good at recognizing faces\nbecause indeed, there are some people\nthat are kind of face blind.\nThey don't actually recognize people\nwhen they walk in the room.\nI used to work with somebody like this.\nI'd walk into his office and he'd say,\nare you Rich or are you Andrew?\nAnd I would say, well am I rich, rich.\nLike, you know, wealth rich?\nNo.\nAnd he'd say, no, are you\nRichard or are you Andrew?\nAnd I'd say, I'm Andrew.\nWe know each other really well.\nAnd he'd say, oh I'm sorry.\nI'm kind of face blind.\nAnd it actually tended\nto be better or worse\ndepending on how much he was working.\nIronically, the more rested he was\nthe more face blind he would become.\nSo it wasn't a sleep deprivation thing.\nThat exists, that's out there.\nThere's the full constellation\nof people's ability to recognize faces.\nThat's not really memory.\nAnd yet, visual function is\na profoundly powerful way\nin which we can enhance our memories.\nSo whether or not you're a\nsuper recognizer of faces,\nwhether or not you are face blind\nor anything in between.\nNext I'm going to tell you about a study\nwhich points out the immense\nvalue of visual images\nfor laying down memories.\nAnd you can leverage this information\nand this involves both\nthe taking of photographs,\nsomething that's quite easily\ndone these days with your phone.\nAs well as your ability\nto take mental photographs\nby literally snapping your eyelids shut.\nSo I just briefly want\nto describe this paper\nbecause it provides a\ntool that you can leverage\nin your attempt to learn\nand remember things better.\nThe title of this paper\nis Photographic Memory,\nthe Effects of our Volitional Photo-Taking\non Memory for Visual and Auditory\nAspects of an Experience.\nI really like this paper because it refers\nto photographic memory not in the context\nof photographic memory\nthat we normally hear about\nwhere people are truly photographic,\nlook at a page and somehow\nabsorb all that information\nand commit it to memory.\nBut rather the use of camera photographs\nor the use of mental camera photographs.\nLiterally looking at\nsomething deciding, blink,\nsnapping a, so to speak,\nsnapping a snapshot\nof whatever it is that you are looking at\nand remembering the content.\nThe reason I like this paper\nand the reason I'm attracted to this issue\nof mental snapshots is this is something\nthat I've been doing since I was a kid.\nI don't know why I started doing it,\nbut every once in a while, I\nwould say maybe twice a year\nI would look at something\nand decide to just\nsnap a mental snapshot of it.\nAnd I've maintained very clear memories\nof those visual scenes.\nTwo years ago I was in an Uber\nand I looked out the window\nand it was a street scene.\nI was actually in New York at the time\nand I decided for reasons\nthat are still unclear to me,\nto take a mental snapshot\nof this city street image.\nEven though nothing interesting\nin particular was happening.\nAnd I do recall that\nthere was a guy wearing\na yellow shirt walking, there\nwas some construction, etc.\nI can still see that\nimage in my mind's eye\nbecause I took this mental snapshot.\nThis paper addresses whether or not\nthis mental snapshotting thing is real\nand this is something I think a lot\nof people will resonate with,\nwhether or not the constant taking\nof pictures on our phones\nor with other devices\nis either improving or\ndegrading our memory.\nYou could imagine an argument for both.\nA lot of people are taking pictures\nthat they never look at again.\nAnd so in a sense, they're outsourcing\ntheir visual memory of\nevents into their phone\nor some other device and they're not ever\naccessing the actual image again.\nThey're not looking at it, right?\nYou're not printing out those photos.\nYou're not scanning\nthrough your phone again.\nSometimes you might do that,\nbut most of the time people don't.\nMost of the photographs people are taking\nthey're not revisiting again.\nSo the motivation for this study was that\nprevious experiments had shown that\nif people take photos of a scene\nor a person, or an object, that\nthey are actually less good\nat remembering the details of that scene\nor object, etc.\nThis study challenged that idea\nand raised the hypothesis that\nif people are allowed to choose what\nthey take photos of, that taking photos,\nagain, this is with the camera,\nnot mental snapshotting.\nThat taking those photos would actually\nenhance their memory for those objects,\nthose places, those people, and in fact,\ndetails of those objects,\nplaces, and people.\nAnd indeed, that's what they found.\nSo in contrast to previous studies\nwhere people had been more or less told,\ntake photos of these following objects,\nor these following people,\nor these following places\nand then they were given a memory test\nat some point later.\nIn this study people were given\nvolitional control, right?\nThey were given agency in making\nthe decision of what to take photos of.\nAnd I'll just summarize the results.\nWe'll provide a link to this study.\nI should say that some of the stuff\nthat they tested was\nactually pretty challenging.\nSome of them were pottery and other forms\nof ceramics that are of\nthe sort that you see\nif you go to a big museum in a big city.\nAnd if you've ever done that,\nand you see all the different objects,\nthere are a lot of\ndetails in those objects\nand a lot of those\nobjects look a lot alike.\nAnd so someone will have two handles.\nSome will have one handle.\nThe position of the handles.\nHow broad or narrow these things are.\nYou know, a lot of this\nis pretty detailed stuff.\nThey also took photos of other things.\nSo basically what they found was that\nif people take pictures of things\nand they choose which things\nthey are taking pictures of, right.\nIt's up to them, it's volitional.\nThat there's enhanced memory\nfor those objects later on.\nHowever, it degraded their ability\nto remember auditory information.\nSo what this means is that when we take\na picture of something, or a person,\nwe are stamping down a\nvisual memory of that thing.\nAnd that makes sense, it's\na photograph after all.\nBut we are actually inhibiting our ability\nto remember the auditory,\nthe sound component\nof that visual scene or\nwhat the person was saying.\nVery interesting.\nAnd points to the fact\nthat the visual system\ncan out compete the auditory system,\nat least in terms of how the hippocampus\nis encoding this information.\nThe other finding I find\nparticularly interesting\nwithin this study is that it didn't matter\nwhether or not they ever\nlooked at the photos again.\nSo they actually had people take photos,\nor not take photos of different objects.\nThey had some people keep their photos\nand they had other\npeople delete the photos.\nAnd it turns out that whether or not\npeople kept the photos\nor deleted those photos\nhad no bearing on whether or not\nthey were better or worse\nat remembering things.\nThey were always better\nat remembering them\nas compared to not taking photos of them.\nWhat does this mean?\nIt means that if you really\nwant to remember something\nor somebody, take a photo\nof that thing or person.\nPay attention while you take the photo.\nBut it doesn't really matter if you look\nat the photo again.\nSomehow the process of taking that photo,\nprobably looking at it.\nYou know, in a camera typically we'd say\nthrough the viewfinder or now\nbecause of digital cameras\non the screen on the back of that camera,\nor on your phone, that\nframing up of the photograph\nstamps down a visual image in your mind\nthat is more robust at serving a memory\nthen had you just looked at that thing\nwith your own eyes.\nVery interesting and it raises all sorts\nof questions for me about whether or not\nit's because you're\nframing up a small aperture\nor a small portion of the visual scene.\nThat's one logical interpretation,\nalthough they didn't test that.\nI should also say that they found\nthat whether or not that you looked\nat a photo that you took,\nor whether or not you deleted it\nand never looked at it again,\ndidn't just enhance visual memory\nor the memory from the visual\ncomponents of that image\nbut it always reduced your ability\nto remember sounds associated\nwith that experience.\nSo that's interesting.\nAnd then last but not least,\nand perhaps most\ninteresting, at least to me,\nwas the fact that you didn't even need\na camera to see this effect.\nIf subjects looked at something\nand took a mental\nphotograph of that thing,\nit enhanced their visual\nmemory of that thing\nsignificantly more than had they not taken\na mental picture.\nIn fact, it increased\ntheir memory of that thing\nalmost as much as taking\nan actual photograph\nwith an actual camera.\nAnd the reason I find this so interesting\nis that a lot of what we\ntry and learn is visual.\nAnd for a lot of people,\nthe ability to learn visual information\nfeels challenging.\nAnd we'll look at something and we'll try\nand create some detailed\nunderstanding of it.\nWe'll try and understand the relationships\nbetween things in that scene.\nIt does appear based on this study\nthat the mere decision to\ntake a mental snapshot,\nlike, okay I'm going to blink my eyelids\nand I'm going to take a snapshot\nof whatever it is I see,\ncan actually stamp down a visual memory\nmuch in the same way that\na camera can stamp down\na visual memory.\nOf course, through vastly\ndistinct mechanisms.\nNo discussion of memory would be complete\nwithout a discussion of the\never intriguing phenomenon\nknown as deja vu.\nThis is a sense that we've\nexperienced something before\nbut we can't quite put our finger on it.\nWhere and when did it happen?\nOr the sense that we've\nbeen someplace before.\nOr that we are in a\nfamiliar state or place\nor context of some kind.\nNow, I've talked about\nthis on the podcast before,\nat least, I think I have.\nAnd the way this works has been defined\nlargely by the wonderful\nwork of Susumu Tonegawa\nat Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology, MIT.\nSusumu collected a Nobel\nPrize, quite appropriately,\nfor his beautiful work on immunology.\nAnd he's also a highly\naccomplished neuroscientist\nwho studies memory and\nlearning and deja vu.\nAnd I should also mention\nthe beautiful work\nof Mark Mayford at the Scripps Institute\nand UC San Diego.\nBeautiful work on this notion of deja vu.\nHere's what they discovered.\nThey evaluated the\npatterns of neural firing\nin the hippocampus as\nsubjects learn new things.\nOkay, so neuron A fires,\nthen neuron B fires,\nthen neuron C fires in\na particular sequence.\nAgain, the firing of neurons\nin a particular sequence\nlike the playing of keys on a piano\nin a particular sequence leads\nto a particular song on the piano\nand leads to a particular memory\nof an experience within the brain.\nThey then used some\nmolecular tools and tricks\nto label and capture those neurons\nsuch that they could go back later\nand activate those neurons in either\nthe same sequence or\nin a different sequence\nto the one that occurred during\nthe formation of the memory.\nTo make a long story short,\nand to summarize multiple papers\npublished in incredibly\nhigh tier journals,\njournals like Nature and Science\nwhich are extremely stringent,\nfound that whether or not\nthose particular neurons\nwere played in the precise sequence\nthat happened when they encoded the memory\nor whether or not those neurons\nwere played in a different sequence,\nor even if those neurons were played,\nactivated that is, all at once\nwith no temporal sequence.\nAll firing in concert all at once,\nevoked the same behavior.\nAnd in some sense, the same memory.\nSo at a neural circuit\nlevel, this is deja vu.\nThis is a different pattern of firing\nof neurons in the brain leading\nto the same sense of what happened,\nleading to a particular\nemotional state or behavior.\nWhether or not this same\nsort of phenomenon occurs\nwhen you're walking down the street\nand suddenly you feel as if, wow,\nI feel like I've been here before.\nYou meet someone and you feel like,\ngosh I feel like I know you.\nI feel like there's some familiarity here\nthat I can't quite put my finger on.\nWe don't know for sure\nthat's what's happening\nbut this is the most mechanistic\nand logical explanation for what\nhas for many decades, if\nnot hundreds of years,\nhas been described as deja vu.\nSo for those of you that\nexperience deja vu often,\njust know that this\nreflects a normal pattern\nof encoding experiences and events\nwithin your hippocampus.\nI'm not aware of any\npathological situations\nwhere the presence of deja\nvu inhibits daily life.\nSome people like the sensation of deja vu.\nOther people don't.\nAlmost everybody, however, describes it\nas somewhat eerie.\nThis idea that even though you're in\na very different place, even\nthough you're interacting\nwith a very different person,\nthat you could somehow\nfeel as if this has happened before.\nAnd just realize this,\nthat your hippocampus,\nwhile it is exquisitely good at encoding\nnew types of perceptions, new experiences,\nnew emotions, new\ncontingencies and relationships\nof life events, it is not infinitely large\nnor does it have an infinite bucket full\nof different options\nof different sequences\nfor those neurons to play.\nSo in a lot of ways it makes perfect sense\nthat sometimes we would feel as if\na given experience had\nhappened previously.\nI'd like to cover one additional tool\nthat you can use to improve\nlearning and memory.\nAnd I should mention, this is\na particularly powerful one\nand it's one that I'm definitely\ngoing to employ myself.\nThis is based on a paper from none other\nthan Wendy Suzuki at New York University.\nWe talked about her a little bit earlier.\nAnd again, she's going\nto be on the podcast\nin our next episode.\nAnd is just an incredible researcher.\nI've known Wendy for a number of years\nand it's only in the\nlast, I would say five\nor six years that she's really shifted\nher laboratory toward generating protocols\nthat human beings can use.\nAnd she's putting that to great effect,\ngreat positive effect I should say.\nPublishing papers of the sort\nthat I'm about to describe.\nBut also incorporating some of these tools\nand protocols into the learning curriculum\nand the lifestyle curriculum\nof students at NYU.\nWhich I think is a terrific initiative.\nSo you don't need to be an NYU student\nin order to benefit from her work.\nI'm going to tell you\nabout some of that work now\nand she'll tell you\nabout this and much more\nin the episode that follows this one.\nThe title of this paper\nwill tell you a lot\nabout where we're going.\nThe title is Brief Daily\nMeditation Enhances\nAttention, Memory, Mood,\nand Emotional Regulation\nin Non-Experienced Meditators.\nIf ever there was an\nincentive to meditate,\nit is the data contained\nwithin this paper.\nI want to briefly describe the study\nand then I also want to emphasize\nthat when you meditate\nis absolutely critical.\nI'll talk about that just at the end.\nThis is a study that involves\nsubjects aged 18 to 45.\nNone of whom were experienced\nmediators prior to this study.\nThere were two general\ngroups in this study.\nOne group did a 13 minute long meditation\nand this meditation was a\nfairly conventional meditation.\nThey would sit or lie down.\nThey would do somewhat of a body scan,\nevaluating for instance\nhow tense or relaxed\nthey felt throughout their body\nand they would focus on their breathing.\nTrying to bring their attention\nback to their breathing\nand to the state of their body\nas the meditation progressed.\nThe other group, which we\ncan call the control group\nlistened to of all things, a podcast.\nThey did not listen to this podcast.\nThey listened to Radio Lab,\nwhich is a popular podcast,\nfor an equivalent amount of time.\nBut they were not\ninstructed to do any kind\nof body scan or pay\nattention to their breathing.\nEvery subject in the study\neither meditated daily\nor listened to a equivalent\nduration podcast daily\nfor a period of eight weeks.\nAnd the experimenters\nmeasured a large number\nof things, of variables, as we say.\nThey looked at measures\nof emotion regulation.\nThey actually measured\ncortisol, a stress hormone.\nThey measured, as the title suggests,\nattention and memory and so forth.\nAnd the basic takeaway of this study\nis that eight weeks but not four weeks\nof this daily 13 minute a day mediation\nhad a significant effect in improving\nattention, memory, mood,\nand emotion regulation.\nI find this study to be very interesting\nand in fact, important because most of us\nhave heard about the positive effects\nof meditation on things\nlike stress reduction.\nOr on things such as improving sleep.\nAnd I want to come back\nto sleep in a few moments\nbecause it turns out to\nbe very important feature\nof this study.\nThis particular study I like so much\nbecause they used a really broad array\nof measurements for cognitive function.\nThings like the Wisconsin\nCard Sorting Task.\nI'm not going to go into this.\nThings like the Stroop Task and they also,\nas I mentioned, measured cortisol.\nAnd many other things, including,\nnot surprisingly, memory.\nAnd people's ability to\nremember certain types\nof information, in fact\nvaried types of information.\nAnd the basic takeaway was, again,\nthat you could get really\nrobust improvements\nin learning and memory, mood and attention\nfrom just 13 minutes a day of meditation.\nNow there's an important\ntwist in this study\nthat I want to emphasize.\nIf you read into the\ndiscussion of the study\nit's mentioned that somehow meditation\ndid not improve but actually\nimpaired sleep quality\ncompared to the control subjects.\nAnd you might think,\nwow, why would that be?\nI mean, meditation is\nsupposed to reduce our stress.\nStress is supposed to inhibit sleep.\nAnd therefore why would sleep get worse?\nWell, what's interesting\nis the time of day\nwhen most of these subjects tended\nto do their meditation.\nMost of the subjects in this study\ndid their meditation late in the day.\nThis is often the case in experiments.\nI know this because we run experiments\nwith human subjects in my laboratory\nand people are paid some amount of money\nin order to participate\nor they're given something\nas compensation for being in the study.\nBut often times the meditation,\nor in the case of my\nlab, the respiration work\nor other kinds of things\nthat they're assigned to do\nare not their top, top priority.\nAnd we understand this.\nBut in this study, the\nmajority of subjects here\nI'm reading completed\ntheir meditation sessions\nfrom somewhere between 8:00 and 11:00 P.M.\nAnd sometimes even between\n12:00 and 3:00 A.M.\nI think there probably were a lot\nof college students\nenrolled in this study.\nAnd their hours often are late shifted.\nThat impaired sleep.\nAnd this raises a bigger theme\nthat I think is important.\nMany times before on this podcast\nand certainly in the episode\non mastering sleep and\nconquering or mastering stress\nthose episodes we talked\nabout the value, again,\nof these non-sleep deep\nrest protocols, NSDR,\nfor reducing the activity\nof your sympathetic nervous system.\nThe alertness, so-called stress arm\nof your autonomic nervous system.\nThe one that makes you feel really alert.\nNSDR is superb for reducing\nyour level of alertness,\nincreasing your level of calmness,\nand putting you into a so-called more\nparasympathetic, relaxed state.\nMeditation does that too, but\nit also increases attention.\nIf you think about meditation,\nmeditation involves\nfocusing on your breath\nand constantly focusing\nback on your breath\nand trying to avoid the distraction\nof things you're thinking or\nthings that you're hearing.\nAnd coming, so-called, back to your body,\nback to your breath.\nSo meditation is actually,\nit has a high attentional load.\nIt requires a lot of\nprefrontal cortical activity\nthat's involved in attention.\nWhich then logically relates\nto one of the outcomes of this study\nwhich is that attention ability\nis improved in daily meditators.\nIt also points out that increasing\nthe level of attention and the activity\nof your prefrontal cortex may,\nand I want to emphasize may,\nbecause here I'm speculating\nabout the underlying mechanism,\ninhibit your ability to fall asleep.\nSo while we have\nmeditation on the one hand\nthat does tend to put us into a calm state\nbut it is a calm, very focused state.\nIn fact, attention and focus are inherent\nto most forms of meditation.\nNon-sleep deep rest, such as Yoga Nidra\nas some of you know it to be.\nOr NSDR, there's a terrific NSDR script\nthat's available free online\nthat's put out by Madefor.\nSo you can go to YouTube, NSDR, Madefor.\nYou can also go do a search for NSDR.\nThere's a number of these\navailable out there,\nagain, at no cost.\nThose NSDR protocols tend to put people\ninto a state of deep relaxation\nbut also very low attention.\nAnd we have to assume very low activation\nof the prefrontal cortex.\nSo the takeaways from this\nstudy are several fold.\nFirst of all, that daily meditation\nof 13 minutes can enhance your ability\nto pay attention and to learn.\nIt can truly enhance memory.\nHowever, you need to do that\nfor at least eight weeks\nin order to start to\nsee the effects to occur\nand we have to presume\nthat you have to continue\nthose meditation training sessions.\nIn fact, they found\nthat if people only did\nfour weeks of meditation\nthese effects didn't show up.\nNow eight weeks might\nseem like a long time,\nbut I think that 13 minutes a day\nis not actually that big\nof a time commitment.\nAnd the results of this study certainly\nincentivize me to start adopting a,\nI'm going for 15 minutes a day now.\nI've been an on and off\nmeditator for a number of years.\nI've been pretty good about it lately,\nbut I confess I've been\ndoing far shorter meditations\nof anywhere from three to\nfive, or maybe 10 minutes.\nI'm going to ramp that\nup to 15 minutes a day.\nAnd I'm doing that specifically to try\nand access these improvements\nin cognitive ability\nand our abilities to learn.\nAlso based on the data in this paper,\nI'm going to do those meditation sessions\neither early in the day, such\nas immediately after waking,\nor close to it.\nSo I might get my sunshine first.\nI'm, as you all know, very\nbig on getting sunlight\nin the eyes early in the day.\nAs much as one can and\nas early as one can.\nOnce the sun is out.\nBut certainly doing it early in the day\nand not past 5:00 P.M. or so\nin order to make sure that\nI don't inhibit sleep.\nBecause I think this, the\nresult that they describe\nof meditation inhibiting quality sleep\ncompared to controls is an important one\nto pay attention to.\nNo pun intended.\nToday we covered a lot\nof aspects of memory\nand how to improve your memory.\nWe talked about the\ndifferent forms of memory\nand we talked about some of the underlying\nneural circuitry of memory formation\nand we talked about the emotional saliency\nand intensity of what\nyou're trying to learn\nhas a profound impact on\nwhether or not you learn\nin response to some sort of experience.\nWhether or not that experience is reading,\nor mathematics, or music, or\nlanguage, or a physical skill.\nIt doesn't matter.\nThe more intense of an\nemotional state that you're in\nin the period immediately\nfollowing that learning,\nthe more likely you are to remember\nwhatever it is that\nyou're trying to learn.\nAnd we talked about the neuro chemicals\nthat explain that effect.\nAbout epinephrine and\ncorticosterones like cortisol.\nAnd how adjusting the timing of those\nis so key to enhancing your memory.\nAnd we talked about the different ways\nto enhance those chemicals.\nEverything ranging from\ncold water to pharmacology\nand even just adjusting\nthe emotional state\nwithin your mind in order to stamp down\nand remember experiences better.\nWe also talked about how\nto leverage exercise,\nin particular, load bearing exercise\nin order to evoke the release of hormones\nlike osteocalcin which can travel\nfrom your bones to your brain and enhance\nyour ability to learn.\nAnd we talked about a new\nform of photographic memory.\nNot the traditional type\nof photographic memory\nin which people can remember everything\nthey look at very easily.\nBut rather, taking mental snapshots\nof things that you see.\nAgain, emphasizing that will create\na better memory of what you see\nwhen you take that mental snapshot,\nbut will actually reduce your memory\nfor the things that you\nhear at that moment.\nAnd we discussed the really exciting data\nlooking at how particular\nmeditation protocols\ncan enhance memory but\nalso attention and mood.\nHowever, if done too late in the day,\ncan actually disrupt\nsleep precisely because\nthose meditation protocols\ncan enhance attention.\nNow I know that many of you are interested\nin neuro chemicals that can\nenhance learning and memory.\nAnd I intend to cover those in deep detail\nin a future episode.\nHowever, for the sake of\nwhat was discussed today,\nplease understand that any number\nof different neuro chemicals can evoke\nor can increase the amount of adrenaline\nthat's circulating in your brain and body.\nAnd it's less important how one accesses\nthat increase in adrenaline.\nAgain, this can be done\nthrough behavioral protocols\nor through pharmacology.\nAssuming that those behavioral protocols\nand pharmacology are safe for you,\nit really doesn't matter how you evoke\nthe adrenaline release because remember,\nadrenaline is the final common pathway\nby which particular experiences,\nparticular perceptions\nare stamped into memory.\nWhich answers our very\nfirst question raised\nat the beginning of the episode.\nWhich is, why do we\nremember anything at all?\nRight, that was the\nquestion that we raised.\nWhy is it that from morning 'til night\nthroughout your entire life you have tons\nof sensory experience,\ntons of perceptions.\nWhy is it that some are remembered\nand others are not?\nWhile I would never want to distill\nan important question such as that down\nto a one molecule type of answer,\nI think we can confidently say based on\nthe vast amount of animal\nand human research data\nthat epinephrine, adrenaline,\nand some of the other chemicals\nthat it acts with in concert, is in fact,\nthe way that we remember particular events\nand not all events.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to

today's episode and\non many previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nFor things like enhancing sleep and focus\nand indeed, for learning and memory.\nFor that reason the Huberman Lab Podcast\nis now partnered with\nMomentous Supplements.\nThe reason we've partnered with Momentous\nis several fold.\nFirst of all, we wanted\nto have one location\nwhere people could go to\naccess single ingredient,\nhigh quality versions of the supplements\nthat we were discussing on this podcast.\nThis is a critical issue.\nA lot of supplement companies out there\nsell excellent supplements\nbut they combine different ingredients\ninto different formulations\nwhich make it very hard to figure out\nexactly what works for you\nand to arrive at the\nminimal effective dose\nof the various compounds\nthat are best for you.\nWhich we think is extremely important\nand that's certainly\nthe most scientific way\nand rigorous way to approach any kind\nof supplementation regime.\nSo Momentous has made these\nsingle ingredient formulations\non the basis of what we suggested to them\nand I'm happy to say, they\nalso ship internationally.\nSo whether or not you're\nin the US or abroad,\nthey'll ship to you.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements recommended\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nyou can go to LiveMomentous.com/Huberman.\nThey've started to\nassemble the supplements\nthat we've talked about on the podcast\nand in the upcoming\nweeks they will be adding\nmany more supplements such\nthat in a brief period of time\nmost, if not all of the compounds\nthat are discussed on this podcast\nwill be there, again,\nin single ingredient,\nextremely high quality formulations\nthat you can use to arrive\nat the best supplement protocols for you.\nWe also include behavioral protocols\nthat can combined with\nsupplementation protocols\nin order to deliver the maximum effect.\nOnce again, that's\nLiveMomentous.com/Huberman.\nAnd if you're not already\nfollowing us on Twitter\nand Instagram, it's HubermanLab\non both Twitter and Instagram.\nThere I describe science\nand science related tools.\nSome of which overlap with the content\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut much of which is distinct\nfrom the content of the\nHuberman Lab Podcast.\nWe also have a newsletter called\nthe Huberman Lab Neural Network.\nThat newsletter provides summary protocols\nand information from our\nvarious podcast episodes.\nIt does not cost anything to sign up.\nYou can go to HubermanLab.com,\ngo to the menu\nand click on newsletter.\nYou just provide your email\nand I should point out,\nwe do not share your\nemail with anyone else.\nWe have a very clear privacy policy\nthat you can read there.\nAnd that newsletter comes\nout about once a month.\nYou can also see some sample newsletters.\nThings like the toolkit for sleep,\nor for neural plasticity and for various\nother topics covered on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nOnce again, thank you for joining me today\nto discuss the neurobiology\nof learning and memory\nand how to improve your memory using\nscience based tools.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[light music]"
