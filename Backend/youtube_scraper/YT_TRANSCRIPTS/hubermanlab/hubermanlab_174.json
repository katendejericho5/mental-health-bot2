    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[cheerful music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing aggression.\nI'm going to explain to you that there are\nseveral different types of\naggression, for instance,\nreactive aggression versus\nproactive aggression.\nMeaning sometimes people\nwill be aggressive\nbecause they feel threatened\nor they are protecting\nthose that they love,\nwho also feel threatened.\nThere's also proactive\naggression where people\ngo out of their way to\ndeliberately try and harm others.\nAnd there is indirect\naggression, which is aggression,\nnot involving physical\nviolence, for instance,\nshaming people and things of that sort.\nIt turns out that there are\ndifferent biological mechanisms\nunderlying each of the\ndifferent types of aggression.\nAnd today I will define those for you.\nI'll talk about the neural\ncircuits in the brain and body\nthat mediate each of the\ndifferent kinds of aggression.\nTalk about some of the\nhormones and peptides\nand neurotransmitters involved.\nI promise to make it\nall accessible to you,\neven if you do not have any\nbiology or science background,\nI will also discuss\ntools, psychological tools\nand biological tools that one can use to\nbetter control aggression.\nNow, right here at the outset,\nI want to acknowledge that any\ndiscussion about aggression\nhas to have an element\nof context within it.\nTo be fair, human beings\ninvest a lot of money,\na lot of time, and a lot of energy,\nand indeed can even derive\npleasure from aggression.\nLater I'll talk about neural\ncircuits in the brain and body\nthat reinforce, in other words,\nreward through the release\nof chemicals that make people feel good.\nActs of aggression.\nHowever, what I'm mainly referring to\nis the context in which\nhuman beings will pay money\nin order to derive what we\ncall vicarious aggression,\nput it simply people spend\nan enormous amount of money\nand time and energy watching\nother people engage in,\nfor instance, aggressive sports.\nAnd we know that observing\nyour team winning\nover another team causes the\nrelease of neurochemicals\nin your brain and body\nthat make you feel good.\nAnd yes, that can make\nyou feel more aggressive.\nWe also know of course that\nmost governments invest\nmany billions if not trillions of dollars\nin infrastructure,\ntechnologies and human beings\nin order to engage in\naggression if needed,\nso-called military warfare, et cetera.\nSo today's discussion will\ninclude a description of\naggression in the pathological sense.\nWe'll actually talk about an\nexplosive aggressive disorder\nthat most of you probably\nhaven't heard of,\nbut is actually far more\ncommon than perhaps, you know,\nwe'll talk about the role of\nthings like attention deficit,\nhyperactivity disorder,\nand how that can relate\nto aggression through\nthe relationship between\nimpulsivity and aggression.\nAnd we'll talk about verbal aggression,\nphysical aggression, proactive aggression,\nas mentioned before,\nand reactive aggression.\nI'm certain that by\nthe end of the episode,\nyou will come away with a much\nmore thorough understanding\nof what this thing that we\ncall aggression really is.\nAnd when you see it in other people,\nI think it will make more sense to you.\nAnd when you observe it in\nyourself or the impulse to engage\nin aggression, verbal,\nor physical or otherwise,\nI hope that you'll\nunderstand it better as well.\nAnd of course, the tools\nthat I will describe\nshould allow you to modulate and control\naggressive tendencies or\npredispositions to aggressiveness\nand just generally to be\nable to engage with people\nin a more adaptive way overall.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an\nall-in-one vitamin mineral\nprobiotic drink that's designed to meet\nall your foundational health needs.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring this podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day is that\nit covers all of my basic\nvitamin mineral and probiotic needs.\nThe probiotics are\nespecially important to me.\nThere are now abundant data\nshowing that the gut microbiome,\nwhich is basically a\ncommunity of trillions\nof little bacteria that live\nin our guts are beneficial\nfor our immune system, for brain function,\nfor mood and many other\naspects of our health.\nThe gut microbiome thrives on\nprobiotics and Athletic Greens\ncontains the proper array of probiotics\nto optimize the gut microbiome.\nAthletic Greens also has\nadaptogens for recovery\nfrom physical and mental exertion,\ndigestive enzymes for gut\nhealth, vitamin C, zinc,\nas I mentioned before, all the\nother vitamins and minerals\nthat you need in order to cover\nyour basic needs each day.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThat'll give you five free\ntravel packs that make it easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road\nand a year supply of Vitamin D3K2.\nThere's now a wealth of\ndata showing that vitamin D3\nis important for many\naspects of our immediate\nand long term health.\nMany people, even if they\nget out in the sunlight\nare not getting enough Vitamin D3,\nand the K2 is thought to be beneficial\nfor calcium regulation and\na number of other things\nimportant to our health.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticGreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim the\nspecial offer of the five\nfree travel packs and the\nyear's supply of vitamin D3K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind,\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system, I can\ntell you that your visual system\nhas to contend with some\npretty tough challenges\nas you move throughout the day.\nFor instance, if you go\nfrom a brightly lit region\nto a dimmer region, your\nvisual system has to adjust.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were designed\nwith those sorts of adjustments in mind.\nSo for instance, if you're\noutside in the shade,\nyou move into the sun and\nthen back into the shade,\nyou don't have to take\nyour sunglasses on and off.\nTheir glasses were initially designed\nfor sports performance\nand the great thing is\nthey could be used for\nthat, but also they have\na terrific aesthetic, so you can wear them\nto work or out to dinner.\nI wear readers at night\nand when I drive at night\nand I wear sunglasses, if I'm out a lot\non really bright days.\nThe terrific thing about\nROKA glasses is that even\nif you get sweaty, they won't fall off.\nSo you can run with them,\nyou can cycle with them.\nOr as I mentioned before, you can just\nwear them out and about.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA,\nyou can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code \"Huberman\"\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA roka.com\nand enter the code \"Huberman\" at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that in my opinion\nare the very best you'll find.\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\na little over a year ago,\nand it's the best sleep\nI've had ever since.\nIf you go to the Helix site,\nthey have a terrific sleep quiz\nthat just takes a few minutes,\nask you questions like,\n\"Do you tend to sleep on your side,\nyour back or your stomach?\"\nMaybe you don't know\nbecause you're asleep,\nbut many people do know.\nAnd even if you don't know that's okay,\nit will also ask you questions like,\n\"Do you tend to run hot or cold?\"\nDo you tend to wake up in the\nmiddle of the night or not?\nAnd by taking that brief\nquiz, they will match you\nto the specific mattress\nthat's ideal for you\nand your sleep needs.\nAnd that's really what sets\nHelix Sleep mattresses apart.\nEverybody's unique, and they know that.\nSo if you take this\nquiz, you'll get matched\nto a particular mattress.\nFor me, it was the\n\"Dusk\" mattress D-U-S-K,\nbut again, that's just me,\nand you may match to that one,\nor you may match to a different one.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress\nand sleeping much better, go\nto helixsleep.com/huberman.\nTake that two minute sleep\nquiz and they'll match you\nto a customized mattress and\nyou'll get up to $200 off\nany mattress order and two free pillows.\nI also love their pillows.\nI've always had this issue with pillows\nthat they heat up too much.\nI'm always looking for the\npillow that can cool itself.\nSomehow the pillows stay nice and cool.\nThey're also not too big,\nso I'm not propped up,\nnot getting the Text Neck\nin the middle of the night,\nwhere I'm letting my chin push my chest,\nnor am I falling back and\nhaving trouble breathing\nin the middle of the night.\nThey're designed just right.\nThey also have a 10 years warranty\nand you get to try it out for\na hundred nights, risk free.\nThey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't love it.\nBut I think that you will.\nAgain, if you're interested, you can go\nto helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nLet's talk about aggression.\nI think that many people\nout there are put off\nby aggression, although\nothers are drawn to aggression\nboth in themselves and when\nobserving it in others.\nThe reason to talk about aggression is,\nthat as mentioned before,\nthe context of aggression really matters.\nSo there are instances where\naggression is adaptive.\nFor instance, a mother\nprotecting her children\nif she's being attacked,\nor if her children are being threatened.\nI think most people would\nagree that so-called\nmaternal aggression of that sort,\nprovided the context is\nright, is a great thing.\nProtecting our young is\nafter all one of the primary\nadaptive drives of our species,\nand thank goodness it is.\nOf course, other forms of aggression\nlike unprovoked, proactive aggression,\nsomebody simply being\nviolent to somebody else,\neven when unprovoked, most of us cringe\nwhen we see that kind of behavior,\nit can even evoke aggression in people\nwhen they observe that kind of behavior.\nSo again, context really matters,\nbut a more general and perhaps\nan even more important reason\nto think about and understand aggression\nis that by understanding the biology\nand psychology of aggression, you will be\nin a much better position to understand\nhow all emotional states come to be,\nboth in yourself and in others.\nFor instance, many of you have\nprobably heard the statement\nthat I believe arises from pop psychology,\nnot from formal academic psychology,\nthat aggression is just sadness.\nIt's a form of sadness that's amplified\nand it shows up as aggression.\nBut when we look at the underlying biology\nand the peer reviewed literature on this,\nnothing could be further from the truth.\nWe have distinct circuits\nin the brain for aggression\nversus grief and mourning,\nthose are non-overlapping.\nNow that doesn't mean that you\ncan't be sad and aggressive\nor in a state of mourning and\naggressive at the same time,\nbut the idea that sadness and aggression\nare one in the same\nthing is simply not true.\nAnd by understanding that,\nor perhaps by understanding\nthat irritability and aggression\nare not the same thing,\nyou'll be in a much\nbetter position to apply\nsome of the tools that we will\ntalk about in this episode\nin order to be able to\nreduce or eliminate,\nor if it's adaptive to you\nto modulate aggression.\nAnd yes, there are cases where\nmodulating your aggression\nin some cases, even amplifying\naggression can be adaptive.\nNow this of course is\nnot the first discussion\nabout the biology of aggression\nor the psychology of aggression.\nAnd we really can look to the\nbeginning of the last century\nas the time in which the formal study\nof aggression really began.\nOne of the names that's most\nassociated with the formal\nstudy of aggression is none\nother than Konrad Lorenz.\nSome of you may be\nfamiliar with that name,\nothers of you may not be\nfamiliar with that name.\nKonrad Lorenz studied\nso-called imprinting behaviors\nand fixed action pattern behaviors.\nHe's most famous, at least\nin scientific circles,\nfor getting geese to believe\nthat he was their parent.\nAnd if you were to put into\nGoogle Conrad with a K, Lorenz,\njust as it sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese,\nyou're going to see a\nlot of photos of Conrad\nwalking down roads with a\nlot of geese following him\nor swimming in lakes with a\nlot of geese following him.\nHe had a habit of geese adopting him\nbecause of the behaviors\nthat he partook in.\nSo he would swim out on a lake\nin front of a bunch of\nlittle geese and then\nthey would think that he was the parent\nand they would imprint on him.\nHe even lived with these\nanimals and they lived with him,\nsort of a strange\ncharacter from what I hear.\nBut nonetheless, all\nthis work was deserving\nof a Nobel prize because\nwhat he discovered\nwere fixed action patterns.\nThat is patterns of behavior\nthat could be evoked by a single stimulus.\nOkay. This is really important.\nThe idea that you can get a\nwhole category of behaviors,\nlike swimming behind a parent,\nor looking to somebody for\ncomfort, and only them,\nthe idea that you could\nget a huge category\nof different behaviors in a\nbunch of different contexts\ntriggered by just the presence\nof that person is remarkable,\nbecause what it suggested\nand what turns out to be true\nis that there are neural circuits,\nnot just individual brain\nareas, but collections\nof brain areas that work together\nto engage a pattern of behaviors.\nAnd that's the first fundamental principle\nthat we need to define today,\nthat when we talk about aggression,\nwe are talking about\nactivation of neural circuits,\nnot individual brain\nareas, but neural circuits\nthat get played out in\nsequence like keys on a piano,\nbut that playing out in sequence means\nthat aggression is a verb.\nIt has a beginning, a middle\nand an end, and it's a process.\nIt's not an event.\nAnd as you'll see, that turns\nout to be very important\nin terms of thinking about\nhow one can halt aggression,\nprevent it from happening\nbefore it's initiated,\nor maybe even prolonging aggression,\nif that's what's needed.\nNow, Konrad Lorenz had no real\nknowledge of neural circuits.\nI mean, obviously he\nknew there was this thing\nthat we call a brain and a nervous system,\nand he knew that there\nwere chemicals in the brain\nand hormones and things of that sort\nthat were likely to play a role,\nbut he really didn't take\nany measures to define\nwhat the neural circuits were,\nfrankly, he didn't need to.\nHe had his Nobel prize and he\ndid all this beautiful work.\nHe's known for an abundance of work,\nbut he did think about what\nsorts of underlying processes\ncould drive something like aggression.\nAnd he talked about one particular feature\nthat's especially important,\nand that's this notion of a pressure.\nThe idea that yes, certain\nhormones will bias somebody\nor an animal to be aggressive,\ncertain neural transmitter\nstates, and you'll learn\nwhat those are today will bias somebody\nto be more or less aggressive,\nmaybe even submissive and passive,\nmaybe outright proactively\naggressive towards anyone\nor anything in front of them.\nAnd yes, of course there\nwill be historical features\nbased on their childhood,\net cetera, et cetera.\nHe understood that there will\nbe a constellation of things\nthat would drive people to be aggressive.\nAnd he described a so-called pressure,\nalmost like a hydraulic pressure.\nJust think about fluid\npressure in a small container\nbeing pushed, pushed,\npushed until the can,\nor the container is ready to explode\nand how multiple features,\nmultiple variables\ncould impinge on that\nand create that pressure.\nIt turns out that's exactly\nthe way the system works.\nThere is no single brain area\nthat flips the switch for aggression.\nAlthough we'll soon talk\nabout a brain structure\nthat generally houses the propensity\nand the output of aggression.\nThis notion of a hydraulic\npressure that can drive us\ntoward aggressive behavior\nor conversely can be\nvery low pressure and keep us\nin a state of non-reactivity,\nmaybe even passivity or submissiveness\nis a very important feature\nbecause it really captures\nthe essence of how neural circuits work\nwhen we're talking about\nprimitive behaviors generally.\nAnd you can start to notice\nthis in yourself and in others,\nyou can start to notice\nwhen you are veering\ntoward aggression or\nwhen someone is veering\ntoward aggression, verbal or physical.\nNow that veering is the buildup\nof this hydraulic pressure\nthat Lorenz was referring to,\nand it really does have an\nunderlying biological basis.\nNow it was some years later\nthat the first experiments\ncame along, which really\nstarted to identify\nthe brain areas and the\nbiological so-called pressures\nthat can induce aggressive behavior.\nAnd the person that really\ngets credit for this\nis a guy by the name of Walter Hess,\nwho at that time was working on cats.\nAnd I know that when say working on cats,\na lot of people will cringe.\nA lot of people have cats as pets,\nand certainly cats can be delightful.\nSome people like them more,\nsome people like them less.\nMost people cringe at the idea\nof doing experiments on cats.\nI should say that these days,\nvery few laboratories work on cats.\nMost laboratories that\nwork on animal models\nwill work on flies, Drosophila fruit flies\nfor their capacity to do genetics,\non laboratory mice, sometimes\nrats, but usually mice.\nAnd occasionally you'll find a\nlab that still works on cats.\nBack in the time of Hess,\nvery few laboratories\nworked on mice, most laboratories\nworked on cats or rats.\nAnd the reason for that is\nnowadays most laboratories\nuse mice if they use animal models\nbecause of the genetic\ntools that exist in mice\nto knock out this gene or\nknock in this gene, et cetera,\nwhich can't be done in\nhumans or non-human primates,\nat least not very easily\nat this point in history.\nSo when I say he was working on cats,\nI realized that probably\nevokes some negative emotions\nin some of you, maybe even\naggression in some of you,\nwhat we can do, however,\nis look at the data\nand make use of the data in\nterms of our understanding.\nWhat Hess did was he\nhad cats that were awake\nand he was able to lower\na stimulating electrode\ninto their brain.\nNow keep in mind that the brain\ndoes not have any pain sensors.\nSo after a small hole\nis made in the skull,\nelectrodes are lowered into the brain.\nThis is what's done commonly\nin human neurosurgery.\nAnd he was able to stimulate\ndifferent brain areas\nand he was sort of poking around.\nAnd when I say sort of,\nhe was doing this with\nsome logical intent and purpose,\nhe wasn't just poking\naround in there for fun.\nHe was trying to identify brain\nregions that could generate\nentire categories of\nbehavior, ALA Lorenz, right?\nThese fixed action pattern behaviors.\nEventually his electrode landed in a site\nand he provided electrical\nstimulation to the cat\nthat caused this otherwise\npassive purring relaxing cat\nto suddenly go into an absolute rage.\nSo arched back, hissing hair up.\nSo called piloerection,\nwhere the hairs go up,\nanimals try to make\nthemselves as big as possible\noften when they're aggressive.\nDrooling, maybe even\nspitting, believe it or not,\ncats and other animals can do this.\nAnd the cat tried to\nattack him or anyone else,\nand anything else, even inanimate objects\nwhen he stimulated this\nparticula brain area.\nSo Hess obviously took notice\nof this incredible\ntransformation in behavior.\nAnd the fact that when he\nturned off the stimulation\nof this particular brain area,\nthe cat very quickly within seconds,\nwent back to being passive calm kitty.\nNow, of course, he repeated\nthis experiment in other animals\nbecause he had to confirm that\nit wasn't just happenstance,\nthat there wasn't something\nunique about this one cat\nthat perhaps he had stimulated an area\nthat had been built up during\nthe kittenhood of this cat\nand had been reactivated.\nMaybe this kitten had been\ntraumatized early in life\nor scared and reactivation\nof a particular circuit,\nunique to that cat created\nthis aggressive behavior.\nThat wasn't the case,\nevery cat that he looked at\nand stimulated this particular brain area,\nthe cat would immediately\ngo into an aggressive,\nalmost rage type behavior.\nNow, of course we can't anthropomorphize.\nWe don't know what the cat was feeling.\nFor all we know the cat could be happy,\nalthough that seems pretty unlikely\nand later experiments done in mice,\nbut also in humans confirm that indeed,\nstimulation of this brain area evoked\nnot just behavioral aggression,\nbut also subjective feelings\nof aggression and anger.\nSo what was this incredible brain area,\nor rather, I should say,\nwhat is the brain area\nthat harbored this incredible capacity\nto generate aggressive\nbehavior in Hess's experiments?\nWell, for those of you\nthat are regular listeners\nof this podcast, you'll\nprobably be relieved to know\nthat today we're going to talk\nabout some new neural circuits,\noftentimes we'll center\nback on the amygdala\nor the prefrontal cortex,\nand those names will come up.\nAnd for those of you that\nhaven't heard them before,\ndon't worry, I'll make it clear as to what\nthose brain areas are and what they do.\nBut today we're going to talk a lot about\nthe so-called VMH or\nventromedial hypothalamus.\nThe ventromedial\nhypothalamus is a nucleus,\nmeaning a small collection of neurons...\nWhat are neurons?\nNerve cells, and that\nsmall collection of neurons\nthat we call the ventromedial\nhypothalamus is truly small.\nIt's only about 1,500 neurons\non one side of your brain\nand a matching 1,500 neurons\non the other side of your brain\nand that combined 3000 neurons\nor so, it's not exactly 3000,\nbut 3000 neurons or so\nis sufficient to generate\naggressive behavior of the sort\nthat Hess observed in the\ncat, and believe it or not,\nwhen you see somebody\nwho's in an act of rage\nor in an act of verbal aggression\nor in an act of defensive aggression,\nprotecting their family or loved\nones or country, et cetera,\nalmost certainly those neurons\nare engaged in that behavior.\nThose neurons are perhaps\neven generating that behavior.\nAnd next I'll describe some\nexperiments that were done\njust recently within\nthe last 10 years or so,\nbut leading right up until this year\nand even last month that keep confirming\nagain and again and again,\nthat it is the activity of neurons\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\nthat are both necessary\nand sufficient to\ngenerate the full catalog\nof aggressive behaviors.\nNow, before I go further to describe\nthe beautiful recent studies on the VMH,\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus,\nand the important role of testosterone,\nand more importantly, estrogen,\nin the activation of aggressive\nbehavior, that's right.\nThat's soon to be clear to\nyou why that's the case.\nI want to emphasize that the\nventromedial hypothalamus\nis something that we\nshould all care about.\nWhy?\nWell, it turns out that many categories\nof psychiatric disorders,\ndevelopmental disorders,\nand psychological challenges,\nthings like schizophrenia,\nPTSD, post-traumatic stress\ndisorder, depression,\nborderline personality disorder,\nand even certain forms of\nautism can include elements\nof aggression and even violence.\nNow it's certainly not the case\nthat aggression and violence\nare present in all people\nwho suffer from schizophrenia\nor PTSD or depression or autism\nor borderline personality disorder.\nI'm absolutely not saying that.\nHowever, it can be a feature of those.\nAnd it's a well described feature\nin terms of trying to\nunderstand the constellation\nof challenges that people suffer\nfrom when they have those.\nSo thinking about the VMH goes\nway beyond just understanding\nbasic aggression in the\ncontext of adaptive aggression.\nSo, you know, when\nearlier I use the example,\nmaternal aggression, that's one\nadaptive form of aggression.\nIt also can be pathologic aggression,\nmeaning it can harm ourselves or others.\nSo keep this in mind as we go forward,\nbecause later we're going\nto talk about specific tools\ndesigned to modulate or prevent\naggression in, for instance,\npeople with attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder,\nand especially kids with ADHD.\nIn the meantime, let's return to the VMH,\nthis relatively small\ncollection of neurons.\nAnd the reason I say\nrelatively small is, well,\nyour brain has many hundreds\nof billions of neurons,\nmaybe even trillions of neurons,\nthe exact number of\nneurons isn't really clear,\nbut it's a lot.\nAnd it certainly is a lot\nrelative to the number of neurons\nthis 3000 or so neurons\nliving in your hypothalamus\nthat can evoke this aggressive response.\nExperiments done by David\nAnderson's lab at Caltech\nwere really the first to\nparse the fine circuitry\nand to really show that the\nventromedial hypothalamus\nis both necessary and sufficient\nfor aggressive behavior.\nThese are important experiments\nand they're worth knowing about.\nWhat they did was they\nidentified, first of all,\nwhere the ventromedial\nhypothalamus was in the mouse,\nthat was pretty straightforward\nto do was sort of known\nbefore they started these experiments.\nAnd then they analyzed which\ngenes, meaning which DNA,\nwhich of course becomes RNA\nand RNA becomes protein,\nwhich DNA and therefore\nwhich proteins are expressed\nin particular cells of the\nventromedial hypothalamus.\nAnd it turns out that\nthere's a particular category\nof neurons in the\nventromedial hypothalamus\nthat make an estrogen receptor.\nAnd it is those neurons in\nparticular that are responsible\nfor generating aggressive behavior.\nHow did they know this?\nWell, they used a tool that's\nactually been described\nby a previous guest of this podcast.\nWe had an episode with the\npsychiatrist and bioengineer\nand my colleague at\nStanford School of Medicine,\nKarl Deisseroth, he and\nothers have developed tools\nthat allow people to control\nthe activity of neurons\nessentially by remote control,\nby shining light on those neurons.\nSo in the context of an\nexperiment on a mouse,\nwhich is what David's\nlab did, and these were\nthe beautiful experiments of Dayu Lin\nwho's now in her own laboratory\nat New York University,\nput a little fiber optic\ncable down into the brain\ninto the hypothalamus\nthat is of the mouse.\nThe mouse is able to move around\nin its cage freely moving,\neven though it has a little\ntether, this little wire,\nit's a very thin wire.\nAnd that little thin wire is actually\na little what we call optrode.\nAnd the experimentalist\nin this case, Dayu,\nwas able to stimulate the turning on\nof a little bit of blue\nlight and that blue light\nactivated only those\nestrogen receptor neurons\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus\nand the way she was able to do that,\nis she had introduced a\ngene that had been developed\nby our friend, Karl\nDeisseroth that allows light\nto trigger electrical\nactivity in those neurons.\nSo if any of that is confusing,\nor if all of that is confusing,\nhere's the experiment.\nThere's a mouse in a cage.\nIt has a little wire\ncoming out of its head.\nIt doesn't notice, believe it or not.\nWe know this 'cause it's\nstill eating and mating\nand doing all the things\nthat mics like to do\non a daily basis and sleeping, et cetera.\nAnd the mere pressing of\na button will activate\na little bit of light released\nat the end of that wire,\nthat light activates particular\nneurons in this case,\nit's the estrogen receptor\ncontaining neurons\nin only the ventromedial hypothalamus.\nWhen that mouse is in a\ncage with another mouse,\na couple of things happen depending on\nwhat the other mouse is, or we could say\nwho the other mouse is.\nIf it's a male mouse and you put in there\nwith a female mouse, the male\nmouse will attempt to mate\nwith a female mouse\nprovided that the male mouse\nhas gone through puberty.\nHe will try to mount and\nmate with the female mouse.\nNow female mice are either\nin a receptive phase\nor a non-receptive phase of\ntheir so-called estrous cycle.\nThey don't have a menstrual 28 day cycle\nThey have an estrous cycle.\nAnd on particular days\nof the estrous cycle,\nthey are not happy to mate.\nThey will basically\nkeep their hindquarters\naway from the male mouse at all costs.\nThey'll even attack the male mouse.\nOn certain days of the\nestrous cycle, however,\nthe female mouse will undergo\nwhat's called lordosis,\nwhich is an arching of her\nback and she'll allow the male\nto mount and mate with her.\nSo a large number of\nexperiments were done,\nbut the first experiment really\nwas to put the male mouse\nin with a female mouse\nwho's in the so-called\nreceptive phase of estrus.\nThat is, she will allow mating\nand he starts mating with her\nand they go through\nthe standard repertoire\nof mating behaviors that\nyou observe in mice:\nmounting, thrusting,\nintromission as it's called\nin the mouse sex world.\nWell, I guess I don't know\nwhat the mice call it,\nbut that's what the experimenters call it.\nAnd then afterwards that\nhe will dismount, okay.\nSo they observe this kind\nof mounting and sex behavior\nis very typical, but about\nhalfway through the behavior,\nDayu turned on the light to stimulate\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\nonly in the male mouse\nand what she observed\nwas incredibly dramatic.\nThe male mouse ceases from trying to mate\nwith the female mouse\nand immediately tries\nto kill the female mouse.\nHe starts attacking her.\nThen she turns off the\nlight, the male stops\nand goes back to trying to\nmate with the female mouse.\nSo I'm sure all of this was very confusing\nand disturbing to the female mouse.\nNonetheless, that was the repertoire.\nThey would mate.\nShe would stimulate these\nventromedial hypothalamus neurons.\nThe male mouse would\nimmediately try and attack\nand kill the female mouse.\nAnd then she would stop the stimulation\nand he would stop trying\nto attack and kill\nthe female mouse, return\nto the attempt, at least,\nto mate with the female mouse.\nThese are such dramatic shifts in behavior\ntriggered only by the\nactivation of only the small set\nof neurons within the\nventromedial hypothalamus.\nAnd for those of you that think\nthat you can watch this sort of thing\nwithout being disturbed, I\nencourage you to go to YouTube.\nWe will provide a link\nwhere you can see a video\nof this type of behavior.\nIt's incredibly dramatic.\nThe shift in behavior\nis almost instantaneous,\noccurs within seconds,\nif not milliseconds,\nthousandths of a second.\nThe next experiment that she\ndid was to put a male mouse\nwith this stimulation\nwith light capability\nin its ventromedial\nhypothalamus into a cage alone,\nbut with a rubber glove\nfilled with air or water.\nMouse, walking around sniffing, peeing,\nwhich is what male mice seem to do.\nThey seem to urinate\neverywhere, that's actually\nan interesting, perhaps\ninteresting feature of male mice\nand actually many male\nanimals, perhaps even humans.\nWe don't know, or maybe we do know,\nbasically this has been an\nobserved time and time again\nin experiments, mainly\nby Lisa Stowers's lab\nat the Scripps Institute,\nthat's characterized this.\nIf you put female mice\ninto an arena or a cage,\nthey always urinate in a very\nsmall corner of that cage.\nWhereas if you put mail mice\ninto an arena or a cage,\nthe urinate everywhere,\nthey have this obsession\nwith spraying their urine everywhere,\nyou can transpose that to\nhuman behavior if you like.\nIn any event, Dayu put the\nmouse in the cage alone,\nbut with this rubber glove,\nthe mouse is walking around\nurinating, et cetera,\ndoing whatever is that mice do,\nthen she stimulates the activation\nof these ventromedial\nhypothalamus neurons,\nand the mouse immediately\ntries to kill the glove.\nIt goes into a rage, attacking the glove\nas if it were another mouse\nor some other animate object.\nBut of course it's an inanimate object.\nIt's just a rubber glove.\nShe stops the stimulation and the mouse\nimmediately goes back\nto being completely calm\nor at least not attacking.\nAgain, we don't know what\nthe mouse was feeling.\nSo these are very dramatic videos.\nAgain, you can see them\nby following the link\nthat we'll provide in the caption.\nIf that sort of thing\nis going to disturb you,\nby to see, for instance, the attack,\none mouse attacking another,\nplease just don't watch them.\nI'm not interested in traumatizing anybody\nor you traumatizing yourself, that is.\nA number of different variations\nwere done on this experiment.\nFor instance, stimulating\nthe VMH in female mice,\nas opposed to male mice,\nputting the female mice\nin with other female mice\nor with other male mice,\nno matter what variation\none carries out, so it doesn't matter\nif it's male with female, male with male,\nfemale with female, et cetera,\nstimulation of the\nventromedial hypothalamus\nin a male mouse or a female\nmouse evokes this very dramatic,\nalmost instantaneous aggressive behavior,\nphysically aggressive behavior.\nSubsequent experiments done by Dayu Lin\nin her own laboratory\nand other laboratories\nhave shown that the ventromedial\nhypothalamus connected\nwith a bunch of other brain\nareas that are interesting,\nAnd I'll talk about some\nof those in a little bit,\nbut one of them that\nI want to call out now\nis the so-called PAG, the\nperiaqueductal gray nucleus.\nThis is a large structure\nin the back of the brain\nthat houses things like neurons\nthat can create opioids.\nWe all know of the opioid\ncrisis, but these are neurons\nthat can produce endogenous,\nmeans made by the body,\nchemicals that can cause pain relief.\nYou could understand why that might occur\nin a circuit for aggression, right?\nEven if one is the aggressor, it's likely\nthat they may incur some physical damage\nand they'd want some pain relief.\nThe PAG also is connected to a number\nof neural circuits that eventually,\nthrough several processing\nstations, excuse me,\narrive at things like the jaws.\nAnd in fact, stimulation of\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\ncan evoke biting and\naggressive biting behavior.\nNow aggressive biting behavior\nis particularly interesting\nbecause in humans and\nespecially in human children,\nbiting is something that,\nwhile young children might do\nas a form of aggression,\ntends to disappear\npretty early in childhood.\nAnd if it doesn't, it's often\nseen as a mark of pathology.\nI have a story about this,\nactually, when I was a kid,\nI went to a summer sports camp\nand I'll never forget this,\nso we're playing soccer and\nin a rare stroke of luck\nor accident, I happened to score a goal.\nI wasn't a particularly\ngood soccer player,\nespecially not at that stage of my life.\nThey later figured out\nthat it was just better\nto make me a fullback, 'cause\nI could just wait there\nand do what fullbacks do.\nI was better at taking\nthe ball or the person out\nthan I was putting the ball in the goal.\nNonetheless, I, again,\nby chance, scored a goal\nand I was trotting back\nto my side of the field,\nand all of a sudden I felt\nthis sting in my back,\na kid, not to be named, although\nI do remember your name,\nI'm not going to tell\nyou what his name was.\nA kid jumped on my back and\nbit me on the top of my back.\nAnd this of course resulted\nin a discussion and a timeout\nand all the usual things and\nparents I think got involved.\nI don't recall, I didn't\nthink much else of it,\nbut I recall that this was\nconsidered especially troubling\nbehavior because he bit\nme as opposed to hit me\nor shoved me down or something that sort,\nand it does seem as if\nthe tendency to use biting\nas an aggressive behavior is associated\nwith a more primitive circuitry.\nNow here I'm truly anthropomorphizing.\nI don't know what this other\nkid happened to be thinking\nor feeling at the time, how could I?\nAnd I certainly am not going to say\nthat biting in every case\nreflects a pathology,\nalthough I think there\nis general agreement\nin the psychology community,\nin the psychiatric community\nthat past a certain age,\nthe using of one's teeth to\nimpart aggression and damage\non others is a particularly\nprimitive and troubling\nor at least for the observer\nor the person experiencing\nis a pretty disturbing event.\nDayu's lab has shown that activation\nof the ventromedial hypothalamus triggers\na downstream circuit in\nthe periaqueductal gray\nwhich then triggers a whole\nother set of circuits of fixed\naction patterns.\nHere we are back to Lorenz\nwith fixed action patterns,\nincluding swinging of the\nlimbs, right punching.\nAnd this wouldn't necessarily\nbe controlled punching,\nbut also biting behavior.\nSo it's remarkable to me,\nat least that we have circuits\nin our brain that can evoke\nviolent use of things like\nour mouth or violent use of\nthings like our limbs.\nThat of course could be used\nfor things like singing or\nkissing or eating or, you know,\ngesticulating in any kind\nof polite or impolite way.\nThe point here is that neural circuits,\nnot individual brain areas\nevoke the constellation\nof behaviors that we call aggression.\nNow, many of you are probably\npuzzled or at least should be\nbecause I've been talking about\nthis highly specialized brain area,\nthe ventromedial hypothalamus\nand this highly specialized\nsubcategory of neurons in the\nventromedial hypothalamus,\nthese neurons that make\nestrogen receptors.\nAnd yet the activation of those cells\ntriggers dramatic and\nimmediate aggression,\nboth in males and in females and both\nagainst males and against females.\nSo what's going on here?\nMost of us think about\nestrogen and we don't\nimmediately think of aggression.\nMost of us hear testosterone and we might\nthink about aggression,\nalthough other things as well.\nIn order to understand this, I\njust want to briefly refer back\nto a conversation that I had\non a previous episode of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAnd that was with my colleague,\nthe great Robert Sapolsky\nof course, is a professor at Stanford\nwho studied testosterone\nand its impacts on behavior\nas well as estrogen and other hormones\nand their impacts on behavior.\nTo make a long story short and to dispel\na still unfortunately very common myth.\nTestosterone does not\nincrease aggressiveness,\ntestosterone increases\nproactivity and the willingness\nto lean into effort in\ncompetitive scenarios.\nSometimes this is referred to\nas the challenge hypothesis,\nbut to make a long story short,\nif people are given testosterone,\nor if you look at people\nwho have different levels,\nexcuse me, of testosterone,\nendogenously that they naturally make.\nWhat you'll find is that\ntestosterone tends to increase\ncompetitiveness, but not\njust in aggressive scenarios.\nSo if somebody is already aggressive,\ngiving them testosterone\nwill have the tendency\nto make them more aggressive.\nIf somebody however is very\nbenevolent and altruistic,\ngiving them testosterone will\nmake them more benevolent\nand altruistic, at least up to a point.\nNow, of course there are certain forms\nof synthetic testosterones that\nare known in sports circles\nand in other circles to\nincrease aggressiveness\nbecause of the way those particular forms\nof synthetic testosterones work.\nBut in general, most of the experiments\nthat I'm referring to have\nnot been done using those,\nthey've been done using\nthe let's call them\nthe more traditional biological\nforms of testosterone\nor that resemble the biological\nforms of testosterone.\nIn fact, Robert Sapolsky described\na really interesting experiment in which,\nif you look at testosterone\nlevels or you administer\nadditional testosterone to people\nwho are doing philanthropy,\ngiving money to organizations\nand so they're essentially doing good\nbecause these are\norganizations doing good.\nWhat you find is that\nincreased testosterone\nor further increasing\ntestosterone makes people\nmore willing to compete,\nto give more money\nthan the other person\nin the room in order,\nyou know, to put it in air quotes,\n\"To Alpha out the other\nperson,\" by giving more money.\nSo this is an act of altruistic\nor benevolent philanthropy.\nIt is not an act of aggression.\nOf course, we don't know what the people\nare feeling underneath all that.\nAgain, we can't\nanthropomorphize or project\nonto other people what they're feeling.\nBut the point is that testosterone itself\ndoes not make people more aggressive.\nAnd in the experiments that\nwe've been talking about\nup until now, it's actually the activation\nof estrogen receptor containing neurons\nthat makes these animals more aggressive.\nAnd it turns out there's\nevidence that in certain context,\nestrogen can make people more aggressive.\nSo what's going on here?\nWell, what's going on is that\ntestosterone can be converted\ninto estrogen through a\nprocess called aromatization.\nThere's an enzyme called aromatase.\nAnytime you have word that ends in A-S-E,\nat least if it's in\nthe context of biology,\nit's almost always not always,\nbut almost always an enzyme.\nSo the aromatase enzyme converts\ntestosterone into estrogen,\nand it is actually\ntestosterone, aromatized,\nconverted into estrogen and then binding\nto these estrogen containing neurons\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\nthat triggers aggression.\nI want to repeat that, it\nis not testosterone itself,\nthat triggers aggression.\nIt is testosterone aromatized\ninto estrogen within the brain\nand binding to these estrogen\nreceptor containing neurons\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus\nthat evokes aggression\nand dramatic aggression at that.\nNow this effect of estrogen\ncausing aggression in the brain\nis very robust, so much so\nthat if you take a mouse\nthat lacks the aromatase enzyme or a human\nthat lacks the aromatase\nenzyme, and they do exist,\nthen there is a reduction\nin overall aggression,\ndespite high levels of testosterone.\nAnd if people who or mice who\nhave the aromatase enzyme have\nthat enzyme blocked, well,\nthen it doesn't matter\nhow much you increase testosterone\nor any of its other derivatives.\nYou do not observe this aggression.\nSo this runs counter to\neverything that we know and think\nabout the role of testosterone.\nAgain, testosterone\nincreases competitiveness.\nIt can increase the desire\nto work under challenge.\nI've said it before, and I ran this\nor pressure tested this\nagainst Robert Sapolsky\nwho's been working on\ntestosterone and it's role\nin the brain and behavior\nfor many decades now.\nIt is fair to say that\ntestosterone has the net effect\nof making effort feel good,\nor at least increasing\nthe threshold at which effort\nfeels bad or unsustainable.\nAnd it does that by way\nof changing the activity\nor the threshold for\nactivation of brain structures,\nlike the amygdala and\nother brain structures\nassociated with anxiety.\nSo the next time somebody says,\ntestosterone makes people aggressive.\nYou can say, \"Ah, no,\nactually it's estrogen\nthat makes people aggressive,\nand animals aggressive\nfor that matter.\nNow of course it is the\ncase that because males\nhave relatively less estrogen circulating\nin their brain and body\nthan females, right?\nBecause they have testes, not ovaries,\nthat testosterone is\nrequired in the first place\nin order to be converted into estrogen,\nto activate this aggressive\ncircuit involving\nthese estrogen receptor containing neurons\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\nBut nonetheless, it is estrogen\nthat is the final step.\nIt is the hormone on\nwhich aggression hinges.\nAnd I think for most people,\nthat's a quite surprising finding.\nAnd yet this is perhaps one\nof the more robust findings\nin both the animal and human\nliterature, as it relates\nto hormones and psychological\nstates and behavior.\nNow, of course it is the case\nthat if testosterone is low,\nthat a person or an animal will exhibit\nless aggressive behavior, but that's not\nbecause of reduced testosterone per se.\nIt's because of the subsequent\nreduction in testosterone,\nmeaning if there's no\ntestosterone to aromatize\ninto estrogen, estrogen\nwill also be lower.\nSo we've established that\nit's not testosterone,\nbut testosterone converted into estrogen\nthat activates these\ncircuits for aggression.\nBut nonetheless, it's\nstill surprising, right?\nI mean, most of us don't\nthink about estrogen\nas the hormone that stimulates aggression,\nbut it turns out it's all contextual.\nThere are beautiful data\nshowing that whether or not\nestrogen stimulates aggression,\ncan be powerfully modulated\nby whether or not days are\nshort or days are long.\nIn other words, whether or not\nhere's a lot of sunshine or not.\nNow, obviously brain is encased in skull.\nSo it doesn't really know\nif there's a lot of sunshine\nout there even though you can\nsee the sun with your eyes,\nyou can feel it on your skin.\nDay length is converted\ninto hormonal signals\nand chemical signals\nand the primary hormonal\nand chemical signals involve\nmelatonin and dopamine\nand also the stress hormones.\nSo to make a very long story short,\nin the long days where\nwe get a lot of sunlight,\nboth in our eyes and on our skin,\nmelatonin levels are reduced.\nMelatonin is a hormone\nthat tends to produce\nstates of sleepiness and quiescence.\nIt also tends to activate\npathways that tend to reduce\nthings like breeding and sexual behavior.\nIn long days, dopamine is increased.\nDopamine is a molecule associated\nwith feelings of wellbeing\nand motivation and the desire to seek out\nall sorts of things, all\nsorts of motivated behaviors.\nAnd in long days provided\nwe're getting enough sunlight\non our skin and to our\neyes, the stress hormones,\nespecially cortisol, and some of the other\nstress hormones are reduced in levels.\nIf estrogen levels are\nincreased experimentally\nunder long day conditions,\nit does not evoke aggression.\nHowever, in short days,\nif estrogen is increased,\nthere's a heightened\npredisposition for aggression.\nAnd that makes perfect sense.\nIf you think about what short days do\nto the biology of your brain and body.\nIn short days, the\nmelatonin signal goes up.\nThere's more melatonin circulating\nfor more of each 24 hour cycle.\nStress hormones are circulating more.\nWhy? Short days tend to\nbe associated with winter.\nIn winter, we are bombarded\nwith more bacterial viruses\nbecause bacterial viruses actually survive\nbetter in cold than they do in heat.\nIn fact, in my laboratory, we work with\na lot of viruses and\nbacteria and when we want\nto keep them alive, we\nput them in the freezer.\nIf we want to kill them, if\nwe want to inoculate them,\nwe put them under UV light.\nLike you would see from the sunlight.\nSo shorter days are\nconducive to aggression.\nNot because days are short per se,\nbut because stress\nhormone levels are higher\nand because dopamine levels are lower.\nNow, here's where all of\nthis starts to converge\non a very clear biological picture,\na very clear psychological\npicture, and indeed\na very clear set of tools that\nwe can think about and use.\nUnder conditions where cortisol is high,\nwhere this stress hormone is\nelevated and under conditions\nwhere the neuromodulator\nserotonin is reduced\nthere is a greater propensity for estrogen\nto trigger aggression.\nNow, again, I know I've said it before,\nbut for males who make\na lot of testosterone\nrelative to estrogen, you\nhave to swap in your mind\nthis idea that if testosterone is high,\nthat means that estrogen is low because\nwhile that can be true in\nthe periphery in the body,\nif testosterone is high,\nthere is going to be\nsome aromatization, that conversion of\ntestosterone to estrogen.\nSo anytime you hear that\ntestosterone is high,\nyou should think testosterone\nis high in the body\nand perhaps estrogen is low in the body.\nBut that means that there's\ngoing to be heightened levels\nof estrogen in the brain and therefore\nincreased propensity for aggression.\nIn females who generally\nmake less testosterone\nrelative to estrogen, there\nis sufficient estrogen\nalready present to trigger aggression.\nSo both males and females\nare primed for aggression,\nbut that's riding on a\ncontext and that context\nof whether or not you get a\ntendency for aggression or not.\ndepends on whether or not\ncortisol is high or low,\nand I'm telling you that if\ncortisol is relatively higher\nin any individual, there's\ngoing to be a tilt,\nan increase in that hydraulic\npressure that Lorenz talked\nabout toward aggression.\nAnd if serotonin, the\nneuromodulator that is associated\nwith feelings of wellbeing and sometimes\neven of slight passivity,\nbut certainly of wellbeing,\nif serotonin is low, there's\nalso going to be a further shift\ntowards an aggressive tendency.\nSo if we return to Lorenz's\nhydraulic pressure model\nof aggression in other internal states,\nwe realize that external\nstimuli, things that we hear,\nthings that we see, for instance,\nsomeone saying something upsetting or us,\nseeing somebody do something\nthat we don't like to others\nor to us, as well as our internal state,\nour subjective feelings of wellbeing,\nbut also our stress level,\nour feelings of whether or\nnot we have enough resources\nand are content with what we have.\nAll of that is converging on this thing\nthat we call internal state and creating\nthis pressure of either to be\nmore aggressive or less aggressive.\nAnd now we have some major players feeding\ninto that final pathway.\nThat question of whether or not\nwill we hit the other,\nperson, will we say the thing\nthat is considered aggressive?\nWill we not say it?\nIf somebody says something\nor does something\naggressive to us, will\nwe respond or will we be\nsubmissive or even passive?\nAgain, there are many things\nfunneling into that question\nand dictating whether\nor not the answer is,\n\"Absolutely I'll fight back,\"\nor, \"I'm going to attack\nthem even unprovoked.\"\nOr if they say this, I'm going to do that,\nor no matter what they do,\nI'm not going to respond.\nThese kinds of things are very complex.\nAnd yet we really can boil them down\nto just a few common elements.\nAnd I'm telling you that those\nelements are whether or not\ncortisol levels are relatively\nlower or relatively higher.\nAgain, relatively higher is going to tend\nto make people more reactive.\nWhy?\nBecause reactivity is really a function\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nwhich is sort of like a\nseesaw that oscillates\nbetween the so-called sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nwhich tends to put us\ninto a state of readiness\nthrough the release of adrenaline.\nCortisol and adrenaline\nwhen they're circulating\nthe brain and body, make\nus more likely to move\nand to react and to speak.\nIt's actually what will induce\na kind of low level tremor,\nwhich is an anticipatory tremor to be able\nto move more quickly, right?\nA body in motion is more\neasily set into further motion,\nthat is, and the neuromodulator serotonin\nis a neuromodulator that\nin general is associated\nwith feelings of wellbeing in response\nto what we already have.\nSo when we are well fed,\nserotonin tends to be released\nin our brain and body,\nin particular, well\nfed with carbohydrates,\nthe precursor to serotonin is tryptophan.\nAnd indeed there are nice studies\nexploring the types of\ndiets, nutritional programs\nthat can reduce aggressive\nbehavior, both in children\nand in adults and tryptophan-rich diets\nor supplementation with tryptophan.\nSo for tryptophan rich diets,\nthings like white turkey meat,\nbut then there are also\na number of carbohydrates\nyou can look up.\nIt's very easy to find foods\nthat contain lots of tryptophan.\nThose foods contain the\nprecursor to serotonin.\nNow it isn't simply the\ncase that eating more foods\nwith tryptophan will tend\nto reduce your aggression.\nI suppose it could do that,\nif you ate it in abundance,\nit could make you tired\nand then you're less likely\nto be aggressive, I don't\nrecommend that strategy,\nbut the idea here is that\nwhen it's been explored,\nincreasing levels of tryptophan\neither by supplementation\nor by food or drugs, prescription drugs\nthat increase serotonin.\nSo for instance, fluoxetine\nsometimes called Prozac\nor Zoloft or any number of the other SSRIs\ntend to reduce aggressive behavior.\nNow, not always, but in\ngeneral, that's the case.\nSimilarly, because elevated cortisol tends\nto shift the whole\nsystem, again, create more\nof a hydraulic pressure\ntowards aggressive states.\nIf cortisol levels are\nreduced, well then the tendency\nfor aggressive behavior is reduced.\nThis is supported by a number\nof peer reviewed studies.\nWe'll provide links to some of those\nin the caption show notes.\nAnd we're going to return to\nthese a bit later in the context\nof specific studies that have\nlooked at genetic variants\nin different individuals that cause them\nto make more or less serotonin,\nor at least to metabolize\nserotonin differently.\nThis is also the case for so-called\nintermittent explosive disorder\nthat can often be associated\nwith gene variants that control\nhow much serotonin is made\nor how it's metabolized or\nhow much cortisol is made\nand how much it's metabolized.\nIn thinking about tools\nthat are a number of things\nthat one could consider.\nFirst of all, there are a\nnumber of decent studies\nexploring how supplementation\nwith the Omega-3 fatty acids,\nwhich are precursors of some\nof the transmitter systems,\nincluding serotonin that can\nmodulate not directly mediate,\nbut modulate mood and emotional\ntone supplementation with\nthe omega 3 S has been shown\nto reduce impulsivity and\naggressiveness in certain\ncontexts in things like ADHD\nor in individuals who\nhave a predisposition\nfor aggressive type behavior\nor aggressive thinking.\nNow that doesn't necessarily\nmean that the omega 3\nfatty acids are going directly\nto the ventromedial hypothalamus\nand changing the activity\nof neurons there more likely they are\ncausing or modulating\nan overall shift in mood\nthrough the immune system,\nthrough hormone systems that are\nchanging the overall tone or\nthe propensity for neurons\nin the ventromedial\nhypothalamus to be activated.\nHow much omega 3 fatty acid, what source?\nWell, we've talked about\nthis on the podcast before.\nYou can, of course get omega 3 fatty acids\nfrom a number of different foods.\nGetting them from whole foods\nis probably the best way\nto do it, but many people,\nincluding people with depression\nwill often supplement\nwith one gram or more\nof omega 3 fatty acid per day.\nSome people including myself\nwill take them every day\nas just a general mood enhancer.\nI don't suffer from depression,\nbut I've found it be\nbeneficial for my health.\nAnd so some people do that,\nand I've talked about before,\nhow in double blind\nplacebo controlled studies,\npeople taking one to three\ngrams of omega 3 fatty acids\nper day, typically in the form\nof a high quality fish oil,\nalthough there are other sources as well,\nalgae and so forth, can\nexperience improvements in mood\nthat are on par with some of the SSRIs,\nthe selective serotonin\nreuptake inhibitors.\nAnd of course, if you're\nprescribed an SSRI\nby your psychiatrist or other\ndoctor, please do take that\nand don't cease to take it\njust simply to take omega 3s.\nHowever you might mention to\nthem, and you can find links\nto the studies in our previous\nepisodes on depression\nthat supplementation\nwith omega 3 fatty acids\nof at this one gram or\nmore of EPA specifically,\nso getting above that one gram threshold,\nas high as three grams per day\nof the EPA has allowed people\nto take lower doses of SSRIs\nand still keep their mood\nin a place that's beneficial for them.\nAnd in terms of keeping cortisol\nin a range that's healthy\nand doesn't bias someone toward\nhigh levels of aggression\nand irritability, that's\nagain, going to be set\nby a number of larger\nmodulators or contextual cues.\nAnd I've talked about some\nof those on the podcast,\nbut I'll just briefly recap them now,\nobviously getting sunlight in\nyour eyes early in the day,\nand as much sunlight as\nyou safely can in your eyes\nthroughout the day is\ngoing to be important.\nAgain, because of this effect\nof estrogen in long days,\nnot increasing aggression,\nhowever, in shorter days,\nestrogen increases aggression\nbecause of the increase\nin cortisol observed in short days.\nAnother way to reduce cortisol\nwas discussed in our episode\non heat and the use of sauna\nand heat, but also hot baths.\nIt turns out that hot baths and sauna\ncan be very beneficial\nfor reducing cortisol.\nAll the details on that are\nincluded in the episode on heat\nand it's timestamped, so\nyou can go directly to that\nif you want to learn\nabout the temperatures\nand the various durations,\nbut to just give\na synopsis of that, a 20\nminute sauna at anywhere\nfrom 80 to a hundred degrees\nCelsius is going to be\nbeneficial for reducing cortisol.\nIf you don't have access to a sauna,\nyou could do a hot bath,\nadjust the temperature\nso you don't burn yourself.\nI think 80 to a hundred degrees Celsius\nis going to be too hot for many people\nif it's a hot bath, whereas\nmany people who can't tolerate\nthat hot bath can tolerate the sauna.\nSo safety first always, and of course,\nbut hot baths reduce cortisol,\nhot saunas, reduce cortisol\nof a duration about 20 or 30\nminutes is going to be beneficial.\nAnd of course, some of you\nmay be interested in exploring\nthe supplementation route and\nfor reductions in cortisol,\nreally the chief player\nthere is ashwagandha,\nwhich is known to decrease\ncortisol, fairly potently.\nI should just warn you\nthat if you're going to use\nashwagandha in order to\nreduce cortisol, first of all,\ncheck with your doctor\nor healthcare provider\nbefore adding or subtracting anything\nfrom your supplementation\nor health regimen.\nOf course, I don't just\nsay that to protect us.\nI say that to protect you,\nyou are responsible for your health,\nwhat you take and what you don't take.\nChronic supplementation with\nashwagandha can have some\nnot so great effects of disruption\nof other hormone pathways\nand neurotransmitter pathways.\nSo the limit seems to be\nabout two weeks of regular use\nbefore you'd want to take\na break of about two weeks.\nSo ashwagandha again, a very\npotent inhibitor of cortisol,\nbut with some other effects as well,\ndon't use it chronically\nfor longer than two weeks.\nBut if your goal is to reduce cortisol,\nlet's say you're going\nthrough a period of increased\nirritability and aggressive tendency,\nmaybe you're also not\ngetting as much light\nas you would like, and\nperhaps also, if there are\nother circumstantial\nthings leading you towards\nmore aggressiveness and\nyour goal is to reduce\naggressiveness, that can\nbe potentially helpful.\nAnd in light of all this stuff\nabout cortisol and estrogen\nand day length, I should\nmention that there are in fact,\nsome people who have a\ngenetic predisposition\nto be more irritable and aggressive,\nand there are a couple of\ndifferent gene pathways\nassociated with this.\nWe never like to think about just one gene\ncausing a specific behavior.\nThe way to think about genes\nis that genes generally code\nfor things within our biology.\nIn the context of today's\ndiscussion, things like\nneural circuits or the\namounts of neurotransmitters\nthat are made, or the amounts\nof hormones that are made,\nor the amount of neurotransmitter\nhormone receptors\nor enzymes, et cetera,\nthat shift the activity\nof our biology in a particular direction.\nThey bias our biology.\nAnd in fact, there is a\ngenetic variant present\nin certain people that adjusts\ntheir estrogen receptor sensitivity,\nand that estrogen receptor\nsensitivity can result\nin increased levels of aggression,\nsometimes dramatic increases, however,\nand also very interestingly, photo period,\nmeaning day length, is a strong\nmodulator of whether or not\nthat aggressiveness turns up or not.\nWhether or not that person with\nthe particular gene variant\nis more aggressive or not,\ndepends on how long the day is\nand how long the night is.\nOne particular study that\nI like that references this\nis Trainer, et al, the\ntitle of the study is\n\"Photo period reverses\nthe effects of estrogens\non male aggression, via genomic\nand non-genomic pathways.\"\nThis was a paper published\nin the proceedings\nof the National Academy of Sciences.\nWe'll put a reference to\nthis in the show notes,\nif you'd like to explore it further,\nbut it really points to the\nfact that rarely, sometimes,\nbut rarely, is it the\ncase that just one gene\nwill cause somebody to\nbe hyper aggressive.\nAlmost always there's\ngoing to be an interplay\nbetween genetics and environment\nand as environment changes\nsuch as day length changes and\nthe length of night changes,\nso too, will the tendency for people\nwith a given genetic variant\nto be more aggressive or not.\nNow, of course, in the absence\nof detailed genetic testing\nfor this particular\nestrogen receptor variant,\nmost people, I'm guessing\nyou, are probably\nnot walking around knowing\nthat you have this gene or not.\nRegardless, I think it's\nimportant to pay attention\nto how you feel at\ndifferent times of year,\ndepending on whether or not summer,\nwhether or not it's winter,\nwhether or not you're\ngetting sufficient sunlight,\nmeaning viewing sufficient\nsunlight or not,\nwhether or not you're getting\nsufficient sunlight exposure\nto your skin or not, whether or not\nyou're indoors all the time.\nGenerally those things\ncorrelate with season,\nbut not always.\nYou can go through long bouts of hard work\nin the summer months when days are long,\nbut you're indoors a lot and\ngetting a lot of fluorescent\nlight exposure late in the evening.\nAnd perhaps that's when you're\nfeeling more aggressive.\nSo we have to be careful\nabout drawing a one-to-one\nrelationship between\nany biological feature\nand certainly psychological\nor behavioral feature\nlike aggressiveness, but\nit's, I believe, helpful\nto know that these genetic biases exist,\nhow they play out again,\nthey shift our biology\nin a general thematic direction.\nThey don't change one thing.\nThey change a variety of things\nthat bias us toward or away\nfrom certain psychological\nand behavioral outcomes\nand the various things that we can do\nin order to offset them.\nAnd we described those\nearlier in terms of trying\nto keep cortisol low by\ngetting sufficient sunlight\nregardless of time of year, and\nregardless of whether or not\nyou happen to have this\nparticular genetic variant.\nSo earlier I talked about\nhow it is testosterone\nconverted into estrogen\nthat's activating aggression\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus,\nnot testosterone itself.\nHowever, there are some\nstudies carried out in humans\nthat have evaluated the\neffects of testosterone\nand how levels of testosterone\ncorrelate with aggressiveness\nin the short term.\nI'm just going to detail\na few of those studies\nbecause I think they are\ninteresting and important.\nFirst of all, there is a\nstudy that has explored\nlevels of testosterone in\nmen of different professions.\nNow, before I tell you the data,\nI want to be very clear here,\nwith a study such as this,\none never knows whether or not these men\nwent into a particular profession because\nthey had a testosterone\nlevel of a given value\nor whether or not the work itself\naltered their testosterone levels or both.\nAnd I think it's fair to\nassume that it's probably both.\nSo be very careful in assuming\nthat a given testosterone\nlevel is causal for\nchoosing a particular career\nor that a particular career is causal\nfor creating a particular\ntestosterone level.\nThis study used salivary\ntestosterone levels\nas the measure, which to\nbe fair is not the best way\nto measure testosterone.\nTypically blood draw would be the best way\nto measure testosterone,\nbut nonetheless, provided\nthe appropriate methods are\nused, salivary testosterone\ncan be a reasonable\nmeasure of testosterone.\nThe different occupations\nthat were looked at were,\nand here they just looked at\nmen in this particular study\nwere ministers, salesmen, they didn't say\nwhat particular types\nof salesmen, firemen,\nprofessors, of all things,\nphysicians and NFL players.\nAnd what they discovered was\nthat the testosterone levels\nwere essentially in that\norder from low to highest.\nSo minister, salesman, fireman,\nprofessor, physician, NFL player.\nNow we could micro dissect\nall the different stereotypes\nand all the different features\nof each of these jobs.\nFor instance, we don't know\nwhether or not the fact\nthat the firemen happened,\nat least in this study\nto have lower testosterone\nlevels on average\nthan the professors or the physicians\nwas because firemen have\nlower testosterone levels\nor because they have a\nmuch more stressful job\nand their cortisol levels\nare higher than the professor\nor the physician and cortisol\nand testosterone, not always,\nbut generally are in somewhat\nantagonistic push-pull mode\nbecause they derive from the\nsame precursor, et cetera.\nTypically, when cortisol is high,\ntestosterone tends to\nbe lower and vice versa.\nSo we don't know what's\ncausing these effects.\nAnd again, this is just one\nstudy and just six occupations,\nbut I think it's relatively\ninteresting given the fact\nthat each of these professions\ninvolves different levels\nof competitiveness, right?\nSo we don't necessarily\njust want to think about\nthe level of physical\nexertion that's required,\nbut also the level of\ncompetitiveness because it's known\nthat competitive interactions\ncan cause increases\nin testosterone, in\nparticular, in the winners\nof competitive interactions,\na topic for a future podcast.\nMeanwhile, studies that\nhave analyzed also again,\nsalivary testosterone in\nprisoners, in this case,\nfemale prisoners, so these\nare incarcerated individuals,\nhave looked at levels of testosterone\naccording to whether or\nnot the person committed\na non-violent or a violent crime in order\nto arrive in prison.\nAnd higher levels of salivary\ntestosterone were related\nto those that had arrived in prison\nbecause of conviction of a violent crime,\nas opposed to a nonviolent crime.\nLikewise, when they analyzed\nprison rule violations,\nso an indirect measure of\naggressiveness, but in this case,\nit was strongly associated\nwith aggressiveness\nbecause they knew what\nthe violations were,\nthey found were for\nprisoners that had none,\nno prison violations, prison\nrule violations I should say,\ntheir testosterone\nlevels tended to be lower\nthan the testosterone levels\nof women that had some,\neven one, or more aggressive\nviolations of prison rules.\nWe'll provide links to these\nstudies in the show notes\nif you'd like to go into them further,\nobviously studies like\nthis need to be taken\nwith a grain of salt\nbecause there are so many\ndifferent factors, different\nprisons have different degrees\nof violence to begin with and\ncompetitiveness to begin with.\nBut just as a final pass\nat examining the role\nbetween testosterone and aggressiveness,\nthere was a very interesting\nstudy from Goetz, et al,\nG-O-E-T-Z published in\n2014, that looked at serum,\nso in this case, blood\nlevels of testosterone.\n30 minutes after application\nof a gel-based testosterone\nthat goes transdermal\nso that the testosterone\ncan go very quickly into the bloodstream,\nand then did brain imaging\nto evaluate the activity\nof neurons in the so-called\ncorticomedial amygdala,\nthe cortico, the medial\namygdala is one of the areas\nof the amygdala complex as we\ncall it because it's complex,\nit's got a lot of different nuclei,\nyou know, know what nuclei\nare, low clusters of neurons.\nIt's got a lot of different\nones, but that medial\nand that cortico medial\namygdala in particular,\nis known to be associated with\naggressive type behaviors.\nIt's linked up with as part\nof the larger circuit that\nincludes the ventromedial\nhypothalamus and other brain areas\nthat we referred to\nearlier, such as the PAG.\nWhat is remarkable about this\nstudy is that it showed that\njust 30 minutes after\napplication of this so-called\nAndroGel, this testosterone that seeps\ninto the bloodstream,\nthere was a significant\nincrease in of course, testosterone\nand corticomedial amygdala activation.\nSo testosterone can have acute effects,\nimmediate effects on the\npathways related to aggression.\nAnd I think this is something\nthat's not often discussed\nbecause many of the\neffects of steroid hormones\nlike testosterone, and\nestrogen are very slow acting.\nIn fact, steroid hormones,\nbecause they have a certain\nbiochemical composition can actually pass\nthrough the membranes of\ncells, so the outside of a cell\nand into the nucleus of the cell\nand change gene expression in the cell,\nyou think about puberty,\nthe kid that goes home\nfor the summer and then comes back\nlooking completely different.\nWell that's because of a\nlot of genes got turned on\nby steroid hormones like\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nbut the steroid hormones can also\nhave very fast acting\neffects and with testosterone\nin particular, those can\nbe remarkably fast acting\nand one of the most apparent\nand well documented fast acting\neffects is this effect: the\nability to activate cells within\nthe amygdala, so you might say,\n\"Well, I thought the amygdala\nwas associated with fear?\"\nWouldn't testosterone then cause fear? No.\nTurns out that the amygdala\nharbors, both cortisol,\ncorticosteroid receptors\nand testosterone receptors,\nand they each adjust the activity\nin the amygdala differently,\nsuch that testosterone tends\nto activate amygdala circuitry\nfor inducing states of mind and body\nthat are more action based\nand indeed in animals\nand in humans, testosterone\napplication and activation\nof this corticomedial amygdala pathway\nwill make animals and\nhumans lean into effort.\nThis is why I say testosterone\nmakes effort feel good,\nor at least biases the organism\ntoward leaning into challenge.\nSo if you recall, there's not\njust one type of aggression,\nthere's reactive aggression,\nwhich is triggered when one\nis confronted with something\nthat sometimes is inevitable, right?\nOne needs to fight for their life\nor for somebody else's life,\nbut also proactive aggression\nand proactive aggression\ninvolves activation\nof those go-pathways in the basal ganglia\nand a leaning into effort to overcome\nwhatever state one happens\nto be in to begin with.\nAnd so this is very important\nbecause it points to the fact\nthat yes, estrogen is\nactivating aggression pathways\nthat are in the ventromedial hypothalamus,\nbut it's very likely the case\nthat testosterone is acting\nto accelerate or to bias\nstates of mind and body\ntoward those that will lead to aggression.\nAgain, aggression is not\nlike a switch, on and off.\nIt's a process.\nIt has a beginning, a middle and an end.\nRemember that hydraulic pressure\nthat Conrad Lorenz hypothesized?\nWell, think of testosterone\nas increasing the pressure\ntoward an aggressive\nepisode and then estrogen\nactually triggering\nthat aggressive episode\nin the ventromedial hypothalamus.\nSo if somebody tells\nyou that testosterone,\nendogenous or exogenous\nmakes people aggressive,\ntell them no, testosterone tends to make\npeople lean into effort.\nAnd if that effort\ninvolves being aggressive,\neither reactively aggressive\nor proactively aggressive,\nwell then it will indeed\nlead to aggression.\nBut the actual aggression\nitself is triggered by estrogen,\nnot testosterone.\nNow, thus far, we really\nhaven't talked too much\nabout the social context\nin which aggression occurs.\nAnd that's because there\nis a near infinite,\nif not infinite number of variables\nthat will determine that.\nSo for instance, violent\naggression is entirely appropriate\nat a professional boxing match provided\nit's occurring inside the ring and only\nbetween the competitors\nand within the bounds\nof the rules of the sport, et cetera.\nHowever, there are some\nthings that tend to bias\ncertain social context\ntoward being more aggressive\nor less aggressive and not\nalways physical aggression.\nAnd those generally come in two forms\nthat many of you are familiar with,\nwhich are alcohol and caffeine.\nLet's discuss caffeine first.\nWhy would caffeine increase\naggressive impulsivity?\nWell, the general effects of caffeine\nare to increase autonomic arousal.\nThe activity of the\nso-called sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nwhich is to put it very\nmuch in plain language\nit's the alertness arm\nof your nervous system.\nThat is, it creates a sense of readiness\nin your brain and body and\nit does so by activating\nthe so-called sympathetic chain ganglia.\nAgain, as I always remind people,\nsimpa and sympathetic\ndoes not mean sympathy.\nSimpa means together, we're all at ones.\nAnd caffeine tends to\nbias our brain and body\nto activate the sympathetic chain ganglia,\nwhich run from about the base of your neck\nuntil the top of your pelvis\nand deploy a bunch of chemicals\nthat jut out into the rest of your body,\nactivate adrenaline release.\nThere's a parallel increase in\nof adrenaline in your brain,\ncreating the state of\nalertness and readiness.\nThat state of alertness\nand readiness can be\nfor all sorts of things,\nnot just aggression.\nHowever when we are in\na state of increased\nsympathetic tone, meaning more alert,\nsuch as after drinking caffeine,\nwe will bias all those brain\nand body systems, the hormones,\nthe chemicals, et cetera that exist,\ntoward action as opposed to inaction.\nSo put simply, caffeine\ncan increase impulsivity,\nno surprise there.\nOn the opposite end of things,\nalcohol tends to decrease\nactivity in the sympathetic\narm of the autonomic\nnervous system, tends to\nmake us feel less alert.\nNow, initially it can\ncreate a state of alertness\nbecause of its effects in\ninhibiting the forebrain,\nour forebrain prefrontal\ncortex in particular\nhas what's called top-down inhibition.\nIt exerts a inhibitory\nor a quieting effect\non some of the circuits\nof the hypothalamus,\nsuch as the ventromedial hypothalamus.\nThe way to conceptualize\nthis is that your forebrain\nis able to rationalize and think clearly\nand to suppress behavior and\nto engage the no-go pathways\ntelling you, \"Don't say that mean thing.\"\n\"Don't do that violent thing,\" et cetera.\nAlcohol initially tends\nto increase our level\nof overall activity by\nreducing inhibition,\nnot just in that forebrain\ncircuit, but in other circuits.\nTends to make us more active.\nWe tend to talk more\nthan we normally would,\nmove more than we normally would,\nbut very shortly thereafter\nstarts acting as a sedative\nby way of reducing\nactivity in the forebrain,\nreleasing some of the\ndeeper brain circuits\nthat are involved in impulsivity,\nbut also causing a\nsomewhat sedative effect.\nAnd then of course, as alcohol\nlevels increase even further,\npeople eventually will pass\nout, blackout, et cetera.\nSo what we've got with\nalcohol and caffeine\nis we've got two opposite\nends of the spectrum,\ncaffeine increasing arousal and readiness,\nand the tendency for impulsivity\nand alcohol also increasing\nimpulsivity, but through\na different mechanism.\nA really interesting study,\nand I should just mention\nthat the title of the study is,\n\"Caffeinated and\nnon-caffeinated alcohol use\nand indirect aggression at the\nimpact of self-regulation.\"\nSo the title is almost self-explanatory.\nThis was a paper published\nin the Journal of Addictive\nBehavior in 2016, examining\nhow ingestion of alcohol\nthat's either caffeinated\nor non-decaffeinated\nalcohol drinks impacted what\nthey call indirect aggression.\nAnd just to remind you what\nindirect aggression is,\nthese are not physical acts of aggression.\nThese are verbal acts of aggression,\nso embarrassing others or otherwise,\nsomehow trying to reduce\nthe wellbeing of others\nby saying certain things\nin particular in groups,\nthis study examined\nboth males and females.\nThis was done on by way\nof a college campus study,\nsubjects were 18 to 47 years old.\nI guess there's some older\nstudents on that campus,\nor maybe they use some\nnon-students, but you know,\nthese days you've also got some students\nthat are in their thirties and forties.\nSo they have a fairly broad\nswath of subjects included,\nfairly broad racial\nbackground as well, included,\nnot at equal numbers, but\nat least they included\na pretty broad spectrum of people\nwith different backgrounds.\nThey looked in particular\npeople that ingested\nnon-caffeinated alcohol\ndrinks at a frequency\nof 9.18 drinks per week, okay.\nAgain, there's a college campus,\nnot that I encourage that.\nI'm one of these people that I don't,\nI've never really liked drugs or alcohol\nand sort fortunate in that\nway I can drink or not drink\nand tend to not drink.\nBut so to me, 9.18, drinks\nper week sounds like a lot,\nbut I know for some people\nthat might actually be typical.\nAnd then others who are drinking at least\none caffeinated alcoholic\nbeverage per week.\nAnd those individuals end as high,\nI should say as 7.87 caffeinated\nalcohol beverages per week.\nSo this would be energy drinks combined,\ntypically with hard alcohol,\nthat's fairly commonly\navailable in bars and so forth.\nAnd some individuals\ndrank as much as goodness,\n20.36 alcoholic drinks per week, total,\nsome that were caffeinated,\nsome that were not caffeinated.\nThe basic outcome of this study was that\nthe more alcohol someone\ntended to consume,\nthe more likely it was\nthat they would engage\nin these indirect\naggressive type behaviors.\nAnd in terms of the caffeinated\nalcoholic beverages,\nthere, the effect was\nespecially interesting.\nHere I'm just going to\nparaphrase or I'll actually\nread from the study, quote,\n\"With regard to caffeinated\nalcoholic beverage use,\nour findings indicated\nthat heavier caffeinated\nalcohol beverage use\nwas associated positively\nwith indirect aggression,\neven after considering\none's typical alcohol use\nand dispositional aggression.\"\nWhat this means is that\neven though alcohol\ncan bias certain individuals\nto be more aggressive,\nand even though certain\nindividuals already have\na disposition toward\nbeing more aggressive,\nthere was an effect that was independent,\nmeaning above and beyond both\nalcohol and a predisposition,\nmeaning if someone was consuming\ncaffeinated alcoholic beverages, they had\na particularly high likelihood of engaging\nin indirect aggressive behavior.\nNow this makes perfect\nsense in light of the model\nthey propose, which is\nthis self-regulation model,\nthat basically self-regulation\ninvolves several things.\nIt involves engaging in certain behaviors\nand suppressing other behaviors.\nSo as described before,\nbecause alcohol tends to have\na sedative suppressive\neffect on the autonomic\nnervous system, at least\nafter the initial period,\nit's going to tend to\nreduce the likelihood\nthat people will engage\nin any type of behavior.\nWhereas caffeine will\nincrease autonomic arousal\nand increase the likelihood\nthat someone will engage\nin a particular type of behavior,\naggressive or otherwise.\nSo the combination of caffeine\nand alcohol is really acting\nas a two prong system\nto bias people towards\nmore impulsivity that\nis less self-regulation.\nSo it's really yanking\nyour volitional control,\nyour ability to engage in\nprefrontal top down inhibition\nover your hypothalamus from two distinct\nand specific circuits.\nBy now, you should be\ngetting the impression\nthat self-regulation is a key feature\nof whether or not\nsomebody, maybe even you,\nis going to engage in aggressive speech\nor aggressive behavior.\nAnd we've talked about a number\nof tools that one can use\nto reduce the probability\nthat that will happen.\nI suppose, if the\ncontext were appropriate,\nyou could even take those\ntool recommendations\nand just invert them and\nincrease the likelihood\nthat aggressiveness would happen.\nBut regardless, self-regulation is key.\nAnd in light of that, I want\nto share with you a study\nthat's focused on kids, but\nthat has important ramifications\nfor adults as well.\nAs you probably are already\naware there are many kids\nout there that suffer from so-called\nattention deficit\nhyperactivity, disorder, ADHD.\nThere are also many adults we are finding\nthat are suffering from ADHD.\nAnd there's also an epidemic\nI would say of people\nthat are concerned about\nwhether or not they have ADHD.\nNow whether or not they have true,\nclinical ADHD or not, is not clear.\nWe did an episode all about\nADHD and tools for ADHD.\nI would encourage you to\ncheck out that episode\nand some of the diagnostic criteria.\nIf you have the opportunity you\ncan find at hubermanlab.com,\nas this study I'm about to\nshare with you aptly points out,\nthere is no objective\ndiagnostic marker of ADHD.\nThere's no biomarker or blood\ndraw or blood test for ADHD,\nwhether or not one has ADHD\ndepends on their performance\non a number of different cognitive tests\nand behavioral tests and self report.\nIn any event, the study\nI'm about to share with you\nexplored how a particular\npattern of supplementation\nin kids with ADHD was able\nto reduce aggressive episodes\nand impulsivity and\nincreased self-regulation.\nAnd the title of the study is,\n\"Efficacy of carnitine in\nthe treatment of children\nwith attention deficit,\nhyperactivity disorder.\"\nEven though they put\ncarnitine in the title,\nthat what they focused\non was whether or not\nacetyl-L-carnitine\nsupplementation could somehow\nadjust the behavioral tendency\nof these kids with ADHD\nand to make a long story\nshort, indeed it did.\nThere was a very significant\neffect of acetyl L-carnitine\nsupplementation on improving\nsome of the symptomology,\nexcuse me, of ADHD.\nA few details about this study\nthat might be relevant to you.\nThis was a randomized double\nblind placebo controlled double\ncrossover study, this was\ndone as an outpatient study.\nSo the kids weren't in a hospital,\nthey were living out in the world.\nThis again was done on younger kids.\nSo this was six to six to 13 year old kids\nthat were diagnosed with ADHD.\nThey received either acetyl\nL-carnitine or placebo,\nand they did all the good practice stuff\nthat good researchers do of making sure\nthat the placebo and\nthe acetyl L-carnitine\nhad similar look and taste.\nIt was consumed twice daily after meals.\nI should just mentioned\nthat acetyl L-carnitine\ntypically is taken in\ncapsule form or occasionally\nan injectable form.\nHere, they they were\nusing this as a drink,\nwhich essentially the\nsame as capsule form,\nbut the powders just\ngoing directly into liquid\nand the carnitine dosage was\n100 milligrams per kilogram.\nSo they're doing this\naccording to the body weight\nof these kids with a maximum\ndosage of four grams per day,\nthe quantity of the\nmedication was supplied here.\nI'm reading for a period of\neight weeks and every eight\nweeks a new quantity of\nmedication was supplied.\nSo basically this is a\nfairly long term study,\nexploring behavioral outcomes\nand psychological outcomes\nin week eight, 16 and 24.\nThey also looked at blood\nthings that you could only get\nthrough a blood draw, so things\nlike hemoglobin, hematocrit,\nred blood cell count, white\nblood cell count, et cetera,\nthey, these are kids and\neven if it were adults,\nthey were quite appropriately examining\na lot of the physiological measures\nthat one would want to\ncarry out to make sure,\nfirst of all, that blood levels\nof carnitine are increasing.\nAnd indeed they confirmed\nthat, but also that\nno negative effects are\nshowing up in the physiology\nas well as the psychology of these kids.\nSo, first I'll just tell you\nthe basic outcome of the study,\nwhich was, here I'm paraphrasing,\n\"Here, given twice\ndaily, carnitine appeared\nto be effective and well tolerated\ntreatment for a group\nof children with ADHD.\"\n\"They showed significant,\nthe abnormal behavior\ncompared to these other boys.\"\nAnd now I'm moving to\nthe table of results.\nThey showed significant reductions\nin their so-called \"Total Problem Score.\"\nThe total problem score is\na well-established measure\nof behavioral problems in kids with ADHD.\nAnd I should say adults with ADHD,\nhas to do with challenges\nin social and learning\nenvironments and how well or poorly\nan individual tends to perform.\nReductions in intentional\nproblems, overall reductions\nin delinquency, and most important\nfor sake of today's discussion,\nsignificant reductions\nin aggressive behavior.\nNow what's especially nice\nabout this study, I think,\nis that even though it's\na relatively small number\nof subjects and certainly\nneeds to be repeated\nin other studies and other laboratories,\nthat they were able to confirm\nthe shifts in L-carnitine\nwithin the bloodstream of these kids,\nthat is they were able to\ncorrelate the physiology\nwith the psychological\nchanges, in studies like this.\nAnd frankly in all studies\nof human pharmacology,\nyou have to worry about\neffects that show up,\nnot just because of placebo effects,\nbut because of so-called\noff target effects\nor related things, totally\nindependent of the drug\nor the particular\nsupplement that you happen\nto be looking at,\nto put in the words of\na great neuroscientist.\nUnfortunately, he passed\naway some years ago,\nbut he was a member of\nthe national academy,\nextremely accomplished\nneuroscientist once turned to me\nand said, \"Never forget\na drug is a substance\nthat when injected into\nan animal or a human being\ncreates a paper,\" meaning you\ncan see effects of pretty much\nany drug or any supplement\nin most all conditions.\nHowever, it is in cases\nsuch as this study,\nwhere you can quite convincingly\nsee that the particular\nfeature of physiology that\nyou expected to change,\nactually changed.\nAnd you see a psychological outcome\nthat you can gain much greater\nconfidence that the changes\nin delinquency, in this\ncase reduced delinquency,\nimproved attention, reduced\naggressiveness and so forth\nwas at least somehow related to the shift\nin blood physiology and\nlevels of L-carnitine\nor acetyl L-carnitine and\ncarnitine in the bloodstream\nof these children, as\nopposed to something else\nlike L-carnitine going and\naffecting some downstream target\nthat you have no knowledge of.\nNow, of course that's\nstill entirely possible,\nbut I think studies such as\nthese increase our confidence\nthat things like L-carnitine can be used\nperhaps in concert with things\nlike omega 3 supplementation,\ndiets that are biased towards\nincreasing more tryptophan\nand therefore more serotonin,\nobviously avoiding things like alcohol\nand as it appears from the\nstudy I just described,\nreducing one's intake or not consuming\nany caffeinated alcoholic\nbeverages seems like\nit would be a good idea if your goal is\nto reduce aggressiveness, to\nthink about the hormone context\nand whether or not you tend\nto have higher testosterone,\nan estrogen or lower\ntestosterone, an estrogen,\nmaybe even think about\nthe work environment,\nwhether or not you are\nexisting in a particularly\ncompetitive work environment\nand even day life,\ntime of year and whether or not\nyou're getting sufficient\nsunlight, whether or not\nyou're avoiding light in\nthe evening and so on.\nSo studies such as this I think are useful\nbecause they point to the fact\nthat very seldom, if ever,\nwill there be one supplement\nor one nutritional change\nor even one behavioral change,\nthat's going to completely\nshift in individual\nfrom being aggressive and impulsive,\nbut rather that by combining\ndifferent behavioral regimens,\nby paying attention to\nthings like time of year\nand work conditions and school conditions\nand overall levels of\nstress and likely therefore\nlevels of cortisol, et cetera,\nthat you can use behaviors,\ndiet, and supplementation\nas a way to shift that overall\ninternal milieu from one\nof providing a lot of\ninternal hydraulic pressure\nas it's been called throughout the episode\ntoward aggressive impulsivity and relax\nsome of that hydraulic pressure\nand reduce aggressive tendencies.\nSo once again, and frankly, as always,\nwe've done a deep dive\ninto the neurobiology\nand the psychology of what I believe to be\nan important feature of our\nlives, in this case aggression.\nI want to point out that in a episode\nin the not too distant future,\nI'm going to be hosting\nDr. Professor David Anderson\nfrom Caltech University,\nwho is the world expert on the\nneurobiology of aggression.\nIn fact, he is the senior\nauthor on many of the studies\nrelated to the ventromedial hypothalamus\nthat I discussed today.\nOur discussion will touch\non aggression, of course.\nSo hearing today's episode will help you\ndigest that information, but\nwe are also going to talk\nabout other emotional states.\nHe is an expert, not just in aggression,\nbut in motivated states related\nto sex and mating behavior,\nsocial relationships of all\nkinds and how those relate,\nnot just to biology and psychology,\nbut also certain forms of pathology,\nthings like PTSD and the\nrelationship for instance,\nbetween anger, fear,\nanxiety, and depression,\nand many other important\ntopics that I know many of you,\nif not all of you will be interested in.\nIn the meantime, I want to point you\nto his recently released\nand wonderful book entitled,\n\"The Nature of the Beast,\nHow Emotions Guide Us.\"\nAnd again, the author is\nDavid Anderson from Caltech.\nThis is a wonderful book.\nIt serves as a tremendous introduction\nto the history of the\nstudy of these areas,\nthe current science and\ndiscoveries being made\nin these areas, all made\naccessible to the scientist\nand non-scientist alike.\nIt's a very engaging read and so much so\nthat even though he was\ngracious in sending me a copy,\nI also purchased myself a\ncopy to give to somebody\nwho is a therapist, and\nI've purchased another copy\nto give to a high school kid that I mentor\nbecause he's very interested\nin the neuroscience of emotions.\nAnd I think we are all\ninterested in emotions,\nnot just fear and some\nof these negative states,\nnot just aggression, but\nalso the positive emotions\nof our lives.\nAnd so, \"The Nature of the\nBeast, How Emotions Guide Us,\"\nby David Anderson is a wonderful read.\nI can't recommend it highly enough.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to our

supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like improving\nthe transition time\nand the quality of your sleep\nand improving alertness and focus.\nAnd so on.\nAnytime you're considering\ntaking supplements,\nthere are several key considerations.\nFirst of all, those supplements should be\nof the very highest quality.\nAnd you want to make sure that\nwhat's listed on the bottle\nis actually what's in the bottle,\nwhich is a problem for any\nsupplement companies out there.\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast\nis pleased to announce\nthat we are now partnered\nwith Momentous supplements\nbecause we believe\nMomentous supplements to be\nof the very highest quality\nof any supplements out there.\nAnd we've been working\nvery closely with them\nin order to direct them,\nto create supplements\nthat are individual ingredient supplements\nof the particular quality and sources\nthat we would like to see,\nand that relate to the\nscience and studies covered\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nIf you'd like to see some\nof those supplements,\nyou can go to livemomentous.com/huberman,\nand there you'll see\nsome of the supplements\nthat we've talked about\non this podcast before\nsuch as magnesium threonate\nfor augmenting sleep,\nthings like L-tyrosine\nfor augmenting dopamine\nand things like L-carnitine,\nwhich we've discussed\non today's podcast.\nRight now, the list of\nsupplements and the products\nthat are there is only partial to what\nwill soon be included in the future.\nSo that's an ever expanding\ncatalog of, again,\nwhat we believe to be\nthe very highest quality\nsupplements available to you.\nFor those of you that are\ninterested in behavioral,\nnutritional and supplementation\nbased tools for neuroscience\nand other aspects of\nyour biology, the impact,\nyour health and performance,\nwe have a newsletter.\nIt is a zero cost newsletter.\nIt's called \"The Neural\nNetwork Newsletter.\"\nYou can go to hubermanlab.com\nand there in the menu,\nyou'll find \"The Neural\nNetwork Newsletter\" sign-up.\nYou can just put your email.\nWe do not share your\nemail

following us\non Twitter an Instagram,\nwe are Huberman Lab on\nboth Instagram and Twitter.\nAnd at both places,\nI describe science and\nscience based tools,\nsome of which overlaps with the content\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut much of which is\ndistinct from the content\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nOnce again, thank you for\njoining me for our discussion\nabout the biology,
