    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to discuss light\nand the many powerful uses of\nlight to optimize our health.\nWe're going to discuss the use of light\nfor optimizing skin health,\nappearance, and longevity,\nfor wound healing, for\noptimizing hormone balance,\nand for regulating sleep, alertness, mood,\nand even for offsetting dementia.\nOne of the reasons why light\nhas such powerful effects\non so many different\naspects of our biology\nis that it can be translated\ninto electrical signals\nin our brain and body,\ninto hormone signals\nin our brain and body,\nand indeed into what we call\ncascades of biological pathways,\nmeaning light can\nactually change the genes\nthat the cells of your bodies express.\nAnd that is true throughout the lifespan.\nToday, I will discuss the mechanisms\nby which all of that occurs.\nI promise to make it\nclear for those of you\nthat don't have a biology background.\nAnd if you do have a biology background,\nI'll try and provide sufficient depth\nso that it's still of interest to you.\nAnd I promise to give you tools,\nvery specific protocols that are extracted\nfrom the peer-reviewed literature\nthat will allow you to use\ndifferent so-called wave lengths,\nwhich most of us think of as colors,\nof light in order to modulate your health\nin the ways that are\nmost important to you.\nFor those of you that are thinking\nthat the use of light to modulate health\nfalls under the category of woo science,\npseudoscience, or biohacking,\nwell, nothing could be\nfurther from the truth.\nIn fact, in 1903, the Nobel\nPrize was given to Niels Finsen,\nhe was Icelandic, he lived in Denmark,\nfor the use of phototherapy\nfor the treatment of lupus.\nSo there's more than a hundred\nyears of quality science\nemphasizing the use of light,\nand as you'll soon see, the\nuse of particular wavelengths\nor colors of light in order\nto modulate the activity\nof cells in the brain and body.\nSo while it is the case that\nmany places and companies\nare selling therapies and products\nrelated to the use of flashing\nlights and colored lights,\npromising specific\noutcomes from everything\nfrom stem cell renewal to\nimprovement of brain function,\nand some of those don't\nhave any basis in science,\nthere are photo therapies that\ndo have a strong foundation\nin quality science,\nand those are the\nstudies and the protocols\nthat we are going to discuss today.\nBut I thought that people\nmight appreciate knowing that\nover a hundred years ago,\npeople were thinking\nabout the use of light\nfor the treatment of various diseases\nand for improving health.\nAnd indeed many of those\ntherapies are used today\nin high quality hospitals\nand research institutions\nand, of course, clinics\nand homes around the world.\nOne of the more exciting\nexamples of phototherapy\nin the last few years\nis the beautiful work of Dr. Glen Jeffery\nat University College London.\nThe Jeffery Lab is known\nfor doing pioneering\nand very rigorous research\nin the realm of visual neuroscience.\nAnd in the last decade or so,\nthey turned their attention\nto exploring the role\nof red light therapy for\noffsetting age-related vision loss.\nWhat they discovered is\nthat just brief exposures\nto red light early in the day\ncan offset much of the vision loss\nthat occurs in people 40 years or older.\nAnd what's remarkable about these studies\nis that the entire duration of the therapy\nis just one to three minutes,\ndone just a few times per week.\nWhat's even more exciting\nis that they understand the mechanism\nby which this occurred.\nThe cells in the back of the eye\nthat convert light information\ninto electrical signals\nthat the rest of the brain can understand\nand create visual images from,\nwell, those cells are\nextremely metabolically active.\nThey need a lot of ATP or energy.\nAnd as we age,\nthose cells get less efficient\nat creating that ATP and energy.\nExposure to red light early in the day,\nand it does have to be early in the day,\nallowed those cells to\nreplenish the mechanisms\nby which they create ATP.\nI'll talk about these experiments\nin more detail later in the episode\nand the protocols so that you\ncould apply those protocols\nshould you choose.\nBut I use this as an example\nof our growing understanding\nof not just that phototherapies\nwork but how they work.\nAnd it is through the linking\nof protocols and mechanism\nthat we, meaning all of us,\ncan start to apply phototherapies\nin a rational, safe, and powerful way.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat I'm hosting two live events this May.\nThe first live event will be hosted\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second live event will be hosted\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a lecture series entitled\nThe Brain Body Contract,\nduring which I will discuss\nscience and science-based tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nAnd I should point out\nthat while some of the material I'll cover\nwill overlap with information covered here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nand on various social media posts,\nmost of the information I will\ncover is going to be distinct\nfrom information covered on\nthe podcast or elsewhere.\nSo once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,\nPortland on May 18th.\nYou can access tickets by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com/tour.\nAnd I hope to see you there.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, also called AG1.\nI started taking AG1 way back in 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1\nand the reason I still take\nAG1 once or twice a day\nis that it covers my foundational\nvitamin, mineral, and probiotic needs.\nIt also has adaptogens\nand things like zinc\nfor immune system function,\nbut the probiotics are one\nof the key features in there.\nI've done several podcasts\non the gut microbiome,\nwhich are these trillions of microbiota\nthat live in our digestive tract,\nand that are crucial\nfor our immune system,\nbrain function, and so on.\nOne way to enhance our gut microbiome\nto ensure that it's healthy\nis to make sure that we\nget the correct probiotics.\nAnd Athletic Greens has\nthe correct prebiotics\nand probiotics that ensure\na healthy gut microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs\nthat make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nso in the car and on the plane.\nI should mention the\nAthletic Greens is delicious.\nI love the way it tastes.\nI mix mine with some water\nand a little bit of lemon or lime juice.\nThis special offer is the\nfive free travel packs\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.\nVitamin D3 has been shown to be important\nfor a tremendous number\nof biological functions.\nMany of us who get sunlight\nget enough vitamin D3.\nMany of us, even if we do get sunlight,\ndo not get enough Vitamin D3.\nSo the year's supply of\nvitamin D3 also has K2,\nwhich is important for\ncardiovascular function\nfor calcium regulation.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics.\nNootropic is a smart drug.\nAnd personally, I'm not a big fan\nof the concept of a smart drug,\nat least not the way that most people talk\nabout smart drugs or nootropics,\nfor the following reason.\nBeing smart involves various things.\nThere is creativity, there's focus,\nthere's task switching, and so on.\nAnd each one of those\ninvolves different operations\nin the brain.\nDifferent neural circuits,\ndifferent neurochemicals\nhave to be deployed in order for us to,\nfor instance, be very focused\nor for us to be very creative\nor for us to be able\nto switch tasks easily.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd for that reason, they've\ndeveloped custom nootropics\nthat are aimed at getting\nyour brain and body\ninto particular states for\nparticular types of work\nor physical activity.\nIn order to accomplish that,\nthey've created unique blends\nof high quality ingredients.\nAnd each of those blends is designed\nto get your brain and body\ninto a particular mode,\nsuch as focus, clarity, or motivation.\nI've been using Thesis nootropics\nfor over six months now.\nAnd I have to say it's\nbeen a total game changer\nand very unique from the experience\nof using sort of what I\ncall catchall nootropics.\nSo with Thesis, it's really directed\ntoward particular brain-body states.\nI should also mention\nthat they tailor those\ncustom blends to you.\nSo by taking a quiz on their site,\nthey will tailor the blend to\nyou and your specific needs\nand the things you don't want.\nSo if you want to try\nyour own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\nyou can go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman.\nYou'll take a three-minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nAnd then based on the outcomes with those,\nthey can update your formulations for you.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nto get 10% off your first box.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is a properly\nbalanced electrolyte drink\nthat has no sugar.\nWhen we get our electrolytes\nin the proper ratios,\nthe cells of our brain and\nbody can function optimally.\nMany people are surprised to find\nthat when they increase\ntheir sodium intake,\nprovided that it is a proper balance\nwith potassium and magnesium,\nthey can think more clearly,\nthey recover from exercise better,\nand they have more energy.\nThere is no surprise as to\nhow that all works, however.\nEvery cell of your body requires\nthe electrolytes to function.\nAnd in particular, the\nneurons of your brain and body\nrequire sodium in order to function.\nSo while people with\npre-hypertension and hypertension\ndefinitely need to be careful\nabout increasing their sodium intake,\nmany people do well to\nincrease their sodium intake,\nagain, provided it's in the proper balance\nwith potassium and magnesium.\nLMNT provides that proper balance.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt,\nthat's L-M-N-T,\n.com/huberman to claim\na free LMNT sample pack.\nYou only cover the cost of shipping.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt, L-M-N-T,\n.com/huberman to claim a free sample pack.\nOkay, let's talk about light.\nFirst, I want to talk\nabout the physics of light,\nand I promise to make that very clear,\neven if you don't have\na background in physics.\nAnd then I want to talk\nabout the biology of light,\nmeaning how light is\nconverted into signals\nthat your brain and body can use\nto impact things like\norgan health or disease,\nor how it can use light\nin order to repair particular organs,\nlike your skin, your eyes,\nyour brain, et cetera.\nThe physics of light\ncan be made very simple\nby just illustrating a\nfew key bullet points.\nThe first bullet point\nis that light is electromagnetic energy.\nIf the word electromagnetic\nfeels daunting to you,\nwell, then just discard that\nand just think of light as energy\nand think of energy as something\nthat can impact other\nthings in its environment.\nNow, the way to imagine light\nor to conceptualize light as energy\nis that all around you light is traveling\nin these little wavelengths.\nAnd the reason, for those\nof you that are watching,\nI'm making a little\nwavey motion with my hand\nis that's actually the way\nthat light energy moves in little waves.\nJust like sound waves are coming at you\nand impinging on your ears,\nif you can hear me talking right now,\nthat is happening,\nthose are sound waves,\nmeaning the movement of\nair particles out there\nimpacting your ear drum.\nWell, light energy is just little bits\nof electromagnetic energy\ntraveling through your environment\nall the time in these little waves\nand impinging on your brain\nand body and eyes, et cetera.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nenergy can change the way\nthat other things behave.\nIt can cause reactions\nin cells of your body.\nIt can cause reactions in\nfruit, for instance, right?\nYou see a piece of\nfruit and it's not ripe,\nbut it gets a lot of\nsunlight and it ripens.\nThat's because the\nelectromagnetic energy of sunlight\nhad an impact on that plant or that tree,\nor even on the fruit directly.\nAs a parallel example of energy\nand its ability to impact other things,\nwe are all familiar with food\nand the fact that food has calories.\nCalorie is a measure of energy.\nIt has everything to do with\nhow much heat is generated\nwhen you burn a particular\narticle of food,\nbelieve it or not.\nAnd it turns out that how hot\na given article of food burns\ngives you a sense of how much energy\nit can provide your body\nin terms of your body's ability\nto store or use that energy.\nSo again, think of light\nas electromagnetic energy,\nbut really put that word\nenergy into capital letters,\nembed that in your mind, going forward,\nand you'll understand most\nof the first bullet point\nof what light is in terms\nof the physics of light.\nNow, the second thing that\nyou need to understand\nabout the physics of light\nis that light has many\ndifferent wavelengths,\nand the simplest way to conceptualize this\nis to imagine that cover\nof that Pink Floyd album,\nwhere there's a prism.\nYou have a white beam of\nlight going into that prism.\nAnd then the prism\nsplits that beam of light\ninto what looks like a rainbow.\nSo you got your reds,\nyour orange, your greens,\nyour blues, your purples, et cetera.\nAnytime we have light in our environment,\nthat is so-called white light.\nIt includes all those wavelengths,\nbut sunlight and other forms of light\nalso have other wavelengths\nof light that we can't see.\nSo when we think about the rainbow,\nthat's just the visible spectrum of light.\nThere are also wavelengths of light\nthat are not visible to us,\nbut that are visible\nto some other animals,\nand that can still impact\nyour brain and body\nbecause there is still\nenergy at those wavelengths.\nI'll give a few examples of this.\nHumans are not a species that can see\ninto the infrared realm of the spectrum.\nA pit viper, meaning a snake\nthat has infrared sensors,\nhowever, can sense in the infrared.\nSo if you were to walk through a jungle\nand there's a pit viper there,\nit sees you as a cloud of heat emission\nbecause your body is emitting\ninfrared energy all the time.\nYou're casting off infrared energy.\nThe snake can see it, you can't.\nIf you were to put on a\nparticular set of goggles\nthat were infrared goggles,\nwell, then you would be able\nto see the heat emissions\nof any organism, human or otherwise,\nthat could emit infrared energy.\nLet's take the opposite\nend of the spectrum.\nWe are familiar with seeing things\nthat are blue or green or very pale blue.\nBut as we say below that,\nmeaning even shorter\nwavelength light is out there.\nUltraviolet light is a really\ngood example of light energy\nthat's coming from the sun\nand is in our environment\nand is being reflected\noff surfaces all the time.\nWe don't see it.\nAnd yet, if it's very bright outside,\nthat ultraviolet light can burn our skin.\nAs you'll learn in today's episode,\nultraviolet light can\nalso positively impact us.\nIn fact, I will describe a particular set\nof new results that show\nthat ultraviolet light\nviewed for just a few minutes each day,\nor landing on the skin for\njust a few minutes each day,\ncan actually offset a lot of pain.\nIt actually has the ability\nto reduce the amount\nof pain sensed by your body.\nAnd we now understand the\nspecific circuits in the brain\nand body that allow that to happen.\nI'll talk about that\nand the related protocols\na little bit later.\nSo the important thing to understand\nabout the physics of light\nis that there's energy at all\nthese different wavelengths.\nWe only see some of those wavelengths,\nwhich basically is to\nsay that light impacts us\nat many different levels.\nAnd the so-called levels\nthat I'm referring to\nare the different wavelengths of light.\nAnd you're welcome to think\nof the different wavelengths\nof light as different colors,\nbut do understand that there\nare truly colors of light\nthat you and I can't see,\nand yet that have powerful\nimpact on your brain and body.\nNow, the third bullet point to understand\nabout the physics of light\nis that different wavelengths of light,\nbecause of the way that\ntheir wave travels,\ncan penetrate tissues to different depths.\nThis is very, very important.\nToday, we're going to talk a\nlot about red light therapies\nand near-infrared light therapies.\nThose are so called longer wavelengths.\nLonger wavelengths, just think\nof a bigger, longer wave, right?\nA bigger curve, as opposed\nto short wavelength light,\nwhich is going to be shorter, right?\nA short wavelength\nlight would be something\nlike blue or green light\nor ultraviolet light.\nBlue, green, and ultraviolet light,\nbecause its shortwave length light,\ndoesn't tend to penetrate\ntissues very easily.\nIt has to do with the way\nthat the physics of light\ninteracts with the physical\nproperties of your skin\nand other tissues of your body.\nBut basically, if you\nwere to shine UV light\nonto your arm, for instance,\nit could impact the skin\non the surface of the arm,\nmaybe some of the cells just\nbeneath the top layer of skin,\nbut it wouldn't penetrate much deeper.\nLong wavelength light like red\nlight and near-infrared light\nhas this amazing ability to\npenetrate through tissues,\nincluding your skin.\nAnd so if we were to shine red light\nor near-infrared light onto your arm,\nit would pass through\nthat top layer of skin.\nIt might impact it a little bit,\nbut it could penetrate\ndeeper into your skin,\nnot just to the skin layers,\nbut maybe even down to the bone,\nmaybe even down to the bone marrow.\nAnd for many people, this\nwill be hard to conceptualize.\nYou think, \"Well, wait,\nI've got the skin there.\nDoesn't the light just bounce off?\"\nAnd the answer is no,\nbecause of the way that\nlong wavelength light\ninteracts with the absorbance\nproperties of your skin.\nAbsorbance properties are just the way\nthat the skin takes light energy\nand converts it into a\ndifferent form of energy.\nAnd your skin is not able to\ntake long wavelength light,\nlike red light and near-infrared\nlight, and absorb it.\nBut the tissues deeper in your body can.\nSo if you shine a red light\nor near-infrared light\nonto the surface of your skin,\nyou'll see a red glow there\nas a reflectance on the\nsurface of your skin.\nBut a lot of the photon energy,\nthe light energy in\nthose longer wavelengths\nis indeed passing through\nthose top layers of skin,\ninto the deeper layers of skin,\nand can even make it into\nthe deep layers of your arm.\nAnd as we start to transition\nfrom the physics of light\nto the biological impacts of light,\njust understanding that the\ndifferent wavelengths of light\nimpact our tissues at different levels,\nliterally at different depths,\nwill help you better understand\nhow light of different colors,\nof different intensities\nand how long you are\nexposed to those colors\nand intensities of light can\nchange the way that the cells\nand the organs of your body work.\nAnd if it didn't sound weird enough\nthat you can pass light\nthrough particular tissues\nand have them land and be absorbed\nat tissues deeper in your body,\nwell, it turns out that\ndifferent wavelengths of light\nare also best absorbed by\nparticular so-called organelles\nwithin your cells.\nWhat are organelles?\nOrganelles are the different compartments\nand different functions\nwithin a given cell.\nSo for instance, your mitochondria,\nwhich are responsible for generating ATP\nand energy in your cells,\nthose exist at a particular depth,\nat a particular location within a cell.\nThey're not all at the cell surface.\nThey sit somewhat deeper in the cell.\nThe nucleus of your\nindividual cells contains DNA,\nand that sits at a\nparticular depth or location\nwithin your cell.\nDifferent wavelengths of light\nnot only can penetrate\ndown into different tissues\nand into different cells of your body,\nbut they can also penetrate\nand access particular organelles,\nmeaning mitochondria or the nucleus\nor the different aspects of your cells\nthat are responsible\nfor different functions.\nThis is exquisitely important,\nand it's exquisitely powerful\nbecause as you'll learn today,\nparticular wavelengths\nof light can be used\nto stimulate the function\nof particular organelles\nwithin particular cells,\nwithin particular organs of your body.\nI can think of no other\nform of energy, not sound,\nnot chemical energy, so not drugs,\nnot food, not touch, no form of energy\nthat can target the particular locations\nin our cells, in our organelles,\nin our organs and in our body,\nto the extent that light can.\nIn other words, if you had to imagine\na real world surgical tool by\nwhich to modulate our biology,\nlight would be the sharpest\nand the most precise of those tools.\nNow, let's talk about\nhow light is converted\ninto biological signals.\nThere's several ways in\nwhich that is accomplished,\nbut the fundamental thing to understand\nis this notion of\nabsorption of light energy.\nCertain pigments or colors\nin the thing that is\nreceiving the light energy,\nmeaning the thing that\nthe light energy lands on,\nare going to absorb particular\nwavelengths of light.\nNow, I promise you that you\nalready intuitively know\nhow this works.\nFor instance, if you were to sit outside\non a very bright sunny day,\nand you had a table in\nfront of you that was metal,\nyou might find it hard to\nlook down at that metal table\nbecause it's reflecting a lot of light\nof particular wavelengths.\nIf that table were pitch black, however,\nit wouldn't reflect quite as much,\nand you would be able to\ncomfortably look at at it.\nIf that table were red, it\nmight be somewhere in between.\nIf that table were green,\nit would be also somewhere in between,\nbut let's say it were very light blue.\nWell, then it might reflect\nalmost as much as a table\nthat were just metal or\na white table surface.\nSo the absorbance properties\nof a given surface\nwill determine whether or not\nlight energy goes and stays\nat that location and has\nan impact on that location\nor whether or not it bounces off.\nEvery biological function of light\nhas to do with the absorbance\nor the reflectance of light\nor light passing through\nthat particular thing,\nmeaning that particular cell\nor compartment within a cell.\nI'd like to make it clear how this works\nby using the three primary examples\nof how you take light in your environment\nand convert it into biological events.\nWe have photoreceptors\nin the back of our eyes.\nThese photoreceptors\ncome in two major types,\nthe so-called rods and the cones.\nThe rods are very elongated,\nthey look like rods.\nAnd the cones look like little triangles.\nRods and cones have\nwithin them photopigment.\nThey have dark stuff that's\nstacked up in little layers.\nRods absorb light of\nessentially any wavelength.\nThere's some variation to that,\nbut let's just say rods don't care\nabout the different colors of light.\nThey will absorb light\nenergy, photon energy,\nif it's red, if it's green, if it's blue,\nif it's yellow, doesn't matter,\nas long as that light is bright enough.\nAnd it turns out that rods\nare very, very sensitive.\nThey can detect very, very\nsmall numbers of photons.\nAnd rods are essentially what you use\nto see in very low light conditions.\nWe'll return more to vision later.\nThe cones come in three major varieties.\nAt least for most people\nwho aren't colorblind,\nyou have so-called red cones,\ngreen cones, and blue cones.\nBut they're not really\nred, green, and blue\nin the back of your eye.\nThey are cones that either absorb\nlong wavelength light, red,\nthat absorb medium\nwavelength light, green,\nor short wavelength light, blue.\nThe reason that they can absorb\ndifferent wavelengths of light\nis they have different photopigments.\nSo much as the example I gave before,\nwhere you have different tables outside\nin the sunny environment,\nand some are reflecting\nlight more than others,\nothers are absorbing\nlight more than others,\nwell, so too, the photoreceptors,\nmeaning the cones,\nare absorbing light of\ndifferent wavelengths\nto different extents.\nAnd in an absolutely incredible way,\nyour brain is actually able\nto take that information\nand create this perception\nthat we have of color.\nBut that's another story altogether\nthat we'll just touch on\na little bit more later,\nbut that if you want to learn all about,\nyou can go to our episode on vision.\nSo that's photoreceptors\nin the back of your eye,\nabsorbing light of different\nwavelengths, rods, and cones.\nThe other place, of course,\nwhere light can impact our body\nis on our surface, on our skin.\nAnd skin has pigment too.\nWe call that pigment melanin.\nWe have within our skin\nmultiple cell types,\nbut in the top layer of skin,\nwhich is called the epidermis,\nwe have keratinocytes,\nand we have melanocytes.\nAnd the melanocytes are the cells\nthat create pigmentation of the skin.\nAnd of course there is wide\nvariation in the degree\nto which there is\npigmentation of the skin,\nwhich has to do with genetics,\nalso has to do with where\nyou were born and raised,\nhow much light exposure you\nhave throughout the year, right?\nSo people toward the equator\ntend to have more melanocyte activity\nthan people who are\nlocated at the North Pole.\nAnd of course, people live\nat different locations\nthroughout the Earth,\nregardless of their genetic background\nor where they were born.\nAnd so, as you all know,\nwith light exposure,\nthose melanocytes will\nturn on genetic programs\nand other biological programs\nthat lead to enhanced\npigmentation of the skin,\nwhich we call tanning.\nThe way they do that is by\nabsorbing UV light specifically.\nSo with melanocytes,\nwe have a very specific example\nof how a pigment absorbs\nlight of a particular length,\nin this case, ultraviolet\nshortwave length light,\nwhich in turn creates a\nset of biological signals\nwithin those cells that\nin turn creates changes\nin our skin pigmentation.\nSo we have photoreceptors,\nwe have melanocytes.\nAnd the third example I'd like to provide\nis that of every cell of your body.\nAnd what I mean by that is\nthat every cell of your body,\nmeaning a cell that is\npart of your bone tissue\nor your bone marrow or heart\ntissue or liver or spleen,\nif light can access those cells,\nit will change the way\nthat those cells function\nfor better or for worse.\nFor many organs within our body\nthat reside deep to our skin,\nlight never arrives at those cells.\nA really good example of this\nthat we'll touch on later is the spleen.\nUnless you have massive\ndamage to your body surface,\nunless you literally\nhave a hole in your body,\nlight will never land\ndirectly on your spleen,\nbut the spleen still\nresponds to light information\nthrough indirect pathways.\nAnd those indirect pathways arise\nthrough light arriving on the skin\nand light arriving on the eyes.\nSo a key principle\nthat I'm going to return\nto again and again today\nis that the ways in which\nlight can impact the biology\nof your organelles, your cells,\nyour organs, and the tissues,\nand indeed your whole body,\ncan either be direct,\nso for instance, light onto\nyour skin impacting skin\nor light onto your photoreceptors\nimpacting the photoreceptors of your eye,\nor it can be indirect.\nIt can be light arriving\non your photoreceptors,\nthe photoreceptors then\ninforming another cell type,\nwhich informs another cell type,\nwhich then relays a signal\nin kind of a bucket brigade manner\noff to the spleen and says to the spleen,\n\"Hey, there's a lot of UV light out here.\nWe're actually under stress.\nIn fact, there's so much UV light\nthat you need to activate\nan immune program\nto protect the skin.\"\nAnd in response to that,\nthe spleen can deploy certain\nsignals in certain cell types\nto go out and start repairing skin\nthat's being damaged by UV light.\nSo we have direct signals\nand we have indirect signals,\nbut in every case,\nit starts with light of\nparticular wavelengths\nbeing absorbed by particular\npigments or properties\nof the surfaces that\nthose light waves land on.\nAnd as you recall from our discussion\nabout the physics of light, remember,\nit's not just about light impinging\non the surface of your body.\nLight can actually\npenetrate deep to the skin\nand access at least certain\ntissues and cells of your body.\nEven though you can't see\nthose wavelengths of light,\nthey are getting into you all the time.\nSo perhaps the best way\nto wrap this discussion\nabout the physics and the biology of light\nwith a bit of a bow\nis to think about light as a transducer,\nmeaning a communicator of what's going on\nin the environment around you\nand that some of those signals\nare arriving at the surface\nand impacting the surface of your body.\nBut many of those signals\nare being taken by cells\nat the surface of your body,\nmeaning your melanocytes in your skin\nand the photoreceptors of your eyes,\nand then being passed off\nas a set of instructions\nto the other organs and\ntissues of your body.\nLight can impact our biology in very fast,\nmoderately fast, and slow ways.\nBut even the slow ways in which\nlight can impact our biology\ncan be very powerful\nand very long-lasting.\nJust as a quick example\nof the rapid effects\nof light on our biology,\nif you were to go from a room\nthat is dimly lit or dark\ninto a very brightly lit room,\nyou would immediately feel very alert.\nYou might say, \"No, that's the not true.\nSometimes I wake up and it's\ndark, and I kind of stumble out\nand it's lighter out in the next room.\nAnd it takes me a while to wake up.\"\nAh, but if we were to move you from a room\nthat was very dark to very bright,\na signal conveyed from your eyes\nto an area of your brain stem\ncalled the locus coeruleus\nwould cause the release of adrenaline\nsimilar to the release of adrenaline\nif you were to be dropped\ninto very, very cold water\nall of a sudden.\nJust an immediate wake-up\nsignal to your brain and body.\nSo that's an example of a rapid effect\nof light on your biology,\nnot a very typical one, but nonetheless,\none that has a hardwired\nbiological mechanism.\nAt the other end of the spectrum\nare what we call slow\nintegrating effects of light\non our biology.\nSo what I mean by that are\nways in which your body\nis taking information about\nlight in the environment,\nnot in the sort of snapshot, acute sense,\nbut averaging the amount of\nlight in your environment.\nAnd that average light information\nis changing the way\nthat your biology works.\nBut even though this is a slow process,\nas I mentioned before,\nit's a very powerful one.\nThe primary example of this\nare so-called circannual rhythms.\nCircannual rhythms are\nliterally a calendar\nthat exists within your\nbody that uses not numbers,\nbut amounts of hormone that are released\ninto your brain and body\neach day and each night\nas a way of knowing where you are\nin the 365-day calendar year.\nNow that might seem kind of\ncrazy, but it's not crazy.\nThe Earth travels around\nthe sun once every 365 days.\nAnd depending on where you are\non the Earth, where you live,\nyou are going to get more or\nless light each day on average,\ndepending on the time of year.\nSo if you're in the Northern Hemisphere,\nin the winter months, days are\nshorter, nights are longer.\nIn the summer months, days are\nlonger, nights are shorter.\nAnd of course, things\nchange whether or not you're\nin the Northern Hemisphere\nor the Southern Hemisphere,\nbut nonetheless in short\ndays you have more darkness,\nthat's obvious.\nAnd if you understand that\nlight arriving on the eyes\nis absorbed by a particular cell type\ncalled the intrinsically\nphotosensitive ganglion cell.\nIt's just a name.\nYou don't need to know\nthe name, but if you want,\nit's the so-called intrinsically\nphotosensitive ganglion cell,\nalso called the melanopsin cell\nbecause it contains an opsin,\na photopigment that absorbs\nshortwave length light\nthat arrives through sunlight.\nThose cells communicate to\nparticular stations in the brain\nthat in turn connect to\nyour so-called pineal gland,\nwhich is this little pea-sized gland\nin the middle of your brain\nthat releases a hormone called melatonin.\nAnd the only thing you\nneed to know is that light\nactivates these particular cells,\nthe intrinsically\nphotosensitive melanopsin cells,\nwhich in turn shuts down\nthe production of melatonin\nfrom the pineal gland.\nIf you think about this\nin terms of the travel\nof the Earth around the\nsun across the year,\nwhat it means is that in short days,\nbecause there's very\nlittle light on average\nlanding on these cells,\nthe duration of melatonin\nrelease will be much longer\nbecause as I mentioned\nbefore, light inhibits,\nit shuts down melatonin.\nWhereas in the summer months,\nmuch more light on average\nwill land on your eyes, right?\nBecause days are longer.\nEven if you're spending more time indoors,\non average, you're going to get more light\nto activate these cells.\nAnd because light shuts\ndown melatonin production,\nwhat you'll find is that the\nduration of melatonin release\nfor the pineal is much shorter.\nSo melatonin is a transducer.\nIt's a communicator of\nhow much light on average\nis in your physical environment.\nWhat this means is\nfor people living in\nthe Northern Hemisphere,\nyou're getting more melatonin\nrelease in the winter months\nthan you are in the summer months.\nSo you have a calendar system\nthat is based in a hormone,\nand that hormone is using\nlight in order to determine\nwhere you are in that\njourney around the sun.\nNow, this is beautiful.\nAt least to me, it's beautiful\nbecause what it means is that\nthe environment around us\nis converted into a signal\nthat changes the environment within us.\nThat signal is melatonin,\nand melatonin is well known for its role\nin making us sleepy each night\nand allowing us to fall asleep.\nMany of you have probably heard before,\nI am not a big fan of\nmelatonin supplementation\nfor a number of reasons,\nbut just as a quick aside,\nthe levels of melatonin\nthat are in most supplements\nare far too high to really\nbe considered physiological.\nThey are indeed super\nphysiological in most cases,\nand melatonin can have a\nnumber of different effects,\nnot just related to sleep,\nbut that's supplemented melatonin.\nHere, I'm talking about\nour natural production\nand release of melatonin\naccording to where we are in\nthe 365-day calendar year.\nEndogenous melatonin,\nmeaning the melatonin\nthat we make within our bodies naturally,\nnot melatonin that's supplemented,\nhas two general categories of effects.\nThe first set of effects are\nso called regulatory effects\nand the others are protective effects.\nThe regulatory effects are for instance,\nthat melatonin can\npositively impact bone mass.\nSo melatonin can, for instance,\nturn on the production of osteoblasts,\nwhich are essentially stem\ncells that make more bone for us\nthat make our bones stronger\nand that can replace\ndamaged aspects of our bone.\nMelatonin is also involved in maturation\nof the gonads during puberty,\nthe ovaries and the testes.\nAlthough there, the effects of melatonin\ntend to be suppressive on maturation\nof the ovaries and testes,\nmeaning high levels of melatonin\ntend to reduce testicle volume\nand reduce certain\nfunctions within the testes,\nincluding sperm production\nand testosterone production.\nAnd within the ovaries,\nmelatonin can suppress\nthe maturation of eggs, et cetera.\nNow, I don't want anyone to get scared\nif you've been taking melatonin.\nMost of the effects of melatonin\non those functions are reversible,\nbut I should point out\nthat one of the reasons\nwhy children don't go into\npuberty until a particular age\nis that young children\ntend to have chronically\nhigh endogenous melatonin.\nAnd that is healthy to\nkeep them out of puberty\nuntil it's the right time\nfor puberty to happen.\nSo melatonin can increase bone mass,\nbut reduces gonad mass, so to speak.\nIt's going to have varying effects\ndepending on the ratios and\nlevels of other hormones\nand other biological events in the body.\nBut as you can see,\nmelatonin has these powerful\nregulatory on other tissues.\nI should also mention that\nmelatonin is a powerful modulator\nof placental development.\nSo for anyone that's pregnant,\nif you're considering\nmelatonin supplementation,\nplease, please, please\ntalk to your OB/GYN,\ntalk to your other doctor as well.\nYou want to be very, very cautious\nbecause of the powerful\neffects that melatonin can have\non the developing fetus and placenta.\nFor people that are not\npregnant, in fact, all people,\nmelatonin has a powerful effect\non the central nervous system as a whole.\nYour brain and spinal cord\nare the major components\nof your central nervous system ,\nand melatonin, because it's\nassociated with darkness,\nwhich is just another way of saying\nthat light suppresses melatonin,\nmelatonin is thereby\nassociated with the dark phase\nof each 24-hour cycle,\nit can have a number of different effects\nin terms of waking up or making\nour body feel more sleepy.\nAnd it does that by way of impacting cells\nwithin our nervous system,\nliterally turning on certain brain areas,\nturning off other brain areas.\nAnd it does that through a whole cascade\nof biological mechanisms,\na bit too detailed to get into today.\nSo melatonin is regulating\nhow awake or asleep we are.\nIt tends to make us more\nasleep, incidentally.\nIt's regulating our timing of puberty,\nand it's regulating how our gonads,\nthe testes and ovaries, function,\neven in adulthood, to some extent.\nAnd it's regulating bone mass.\nAs I mentioned before,\nmelatonin also has protective effects.\nIt can activate our immune system.\nIt is among the most potent antioxidants.\nSo it is known to have\ncertain anti-cancer properties\nand things of that sort,\nwhich is not to say that you\nsimply want more melatonin.\nI think a lot of people get misled\nwhen they hear something like,\nmelatonin has anti-cancer properties.\nThat doesn't mean that cranking\nup the levels of melatonin\nby supplementing it, or by\nspending time in darkness\nand not getting any light,\nwhich would, of course, inhibit melatonin,\nis going to be beneficial\nfor combating cancer.\nThat's not the way it works.\nIt is actually the rise\nand fall of melatonin\nevery 24-hour cycle\nand the changes in the duration\nof that melatonin signal\nthroughout the seasons\nthat has these anti-cancer\nand antioxidant effects.\nSo when we think about\nlight impacting our biology,\nthe reason I bring up melatonin\nas the primary example of that\nis A, because melatonin impacts\nso many important functions\nwithin our brain and body,\nbut also because hormones\nin general, not always,\nbut in general, are responsible\nfor these slow modulatory\neffects on our biology.\nAnd so I'm using this as an example\nof how light throughout the year\nis changing the way\nthat the different cells\nand tissues and organs\nof your body are working,\nand that melatonin is the\ntransducer of that signal.\nSo at this point,\nwe can say light powerfully\nmodulates melatonin,\nmeaning it shuts down melatonin.\nMelatonin is both beneficial\nfor certain tissues\nand suppressive for other\ntissues and functions.\nWhat should we do with this information?\nWell, it's very well established now\nthat one of the best\nthings that we can all do\nis to get the proper amount\nof sunlight each day.\nAnd by proper, I mean appropriate\nfor that time of year.\nSo in the summer months\nwhere the days are longer\nand nights are shorter,\nwe would all do well to get\nmore sunlight in our eyes.\nAnd again, it's going to be to our eyes\nbecause as you recall,\nthe pineal sits deep in the brain,\nand light can't access\nthe pineal directly,\nat least not in humans.\nSo in order to get light\ninformation to the pineal\nand thereby get the\nproper levels of melatonin\naccording to the time of year,\nwe should all try and get\noutside as much as possible\nduring the long days of summer and spring.\nAnd in the winter months, it makes sense\nto spend more time indoors.\nFor those of you that suffer\nfrom seasonal effective disorder,\nwhich is a seasonal depression,\nor feel low during the\nfall and winter months,\nthere are ways to offset this.\nWe did an entire episode on\nmood and circadian rhythms\nwhere we described this.\nSo it does make sense for some people\nto get more bright light in\ntheir eyes early in the morning\nand throughout the day during\nthe winter months as well.\nBut nonetheless, changes in melatonin,\nmeaning changes in the duration\nof melatonin release across the\nyear are normal and healthy.\nSo provided that you're not\nsuffering from depression,\nit's going to be healthy to\nsomewhat modulate your amount\nof indoor and outdoor\ntime across the year.\nThe other thing to understand\nis this very firmly established fact,\nwhich is light powerfully\ninhibits melatonin.\nIf you wake up in the middle of the night,\nand you go into the bathroom\nand you flip on the lights,\nand those are very bright,\noverhead, fluorescent lights,\nyour melatonin levels,\nwhich would ordinarily be quite high\nin the middle of the night\nbecause you've been eyes\nclosed in the dark, presumably,\nwill immediately plummet\nto near zero or zero.\nWe would all do well\nregardless of time of year\nto not destroy our melatonin\nin the middle of the night\nin this way.\nSo if you need to get up\nin the middle of the night\nand use the restroom,\nwhich is a perfectly normal\nbehavior for many people,\nuse the minimum amount of light required\nin order to safely move\nthrough the environment\nthat you need to move through.\nMelatonin needs to come\non early in the night.\nIt actually starts rising in\nthe evening and towards sleep.\nBut then as you close your\neyes and you go to sleep,\nmelatonin levels are\ngoing to continue to rise\nat least for several hours into the night.\nAgain, if you get up in\nthe middle of the night,\nreally try hard not to flip\non a lot of bright lights.\nIf you do that every once in a while,\nit's not going to be a problem.\nBut if you're doing\nthat night after night,\nyou are really disrupting\nthis fundamental signal\nthat occurs every night,\nregardless of winter,\nspring, summer, et cetera.\nAnd that is communicating information\nabout where your brain and\nbody should be in time.\nAnd I know that's a little\nbit of a tricky concept,\nbut really our body is\nnot meant to function\nin the same way during the winter months,\nas the summer months.\nThere are functions that\nare specifically optimal\nfor the shorter days of winter.\nAnd there are functions that\nare specifically optimal\nfor the longer or days of summer.\nSo again, try to avoid bright\nlight exposure to your eyes\nin the middle of the night.\nAnd for those of you that\nare doing shift work,\nwhat I can say is try and\navoid getting bright light\nin your eyes in the middle\nof your sleep cycle.\nSo even if you're sleeping\nin the middle of the day,\nbecause you have to work at night,\nif you wake up during that about of sleep,\nreally try hard to limit\nthe amount of light,\nwhich is going to be harder\nfor shift workers, right?\nBecause there are generally\na lot more lights on\nand bright lights outside,\nso you would want to close the blinds\nand limit artificial light inside.\nOne way to bypass some\nof the inhibitory effects\nof light on melatonin\nis to change your physical environment\nby, for instance, dimming the lights.\nThat's one simple way, very low-cost way.\nIn fact, you'll save money\nby dimming the lights\nor turning them off.\nThe other is if you\nare going to use light,\nusing long wavelength light,\nbecause, as you recall,\nthese intrinsically\nphotosensitive melanopsin cells\nwithin your retina that convey the signal\nabout bright light in your environment\nto impact melatonin,\nto shut down melatonin,\nrespond to short wavelengths of light.\nSo red light is long wavelength light.\nYou now understand that\nfrom our discussion\nabout the physics of light.\nAnd if you were to use\namber-colored light or red light\nand even better, dim\namber or dim red light\nin the middle of the night,\nwell, then you would probably\nnot reduce melatonin at all\nunless those red lights and amber lights\nare very, very bright.\nAny light, provided it's bright enough,\nwill shut down melatonin production.\nOne final point about melatonin,\nand this relates to melatonin\nsupplementation as well,\nis that now that you understand\nhow potently melatonin can impact things\nlike cardiovascular\nfunction, immune function,\nanti-cancer properties, bone mass,\ngonad function, et cetera,\nyou can understand why it would make sense\nto be cautious about\nmelatonin supplementation,\nbecause supplementation\ntends to be pretty static.\nIt's X number of milligrams per night,\nwhereas normally endogenously\nthe amount of melatonin\nthat you're releasing each night\nis changing according to time of year,\nor if you happen to live in an area\nwhere there isn't much change\nin day length across the year,\nso for instance, if you\nlive near the equator,\nwell, then your body is accustomed\nto having regular amounts\nof melatonin each night.\nWhen you start supplementing melatonin,\nyou start changing the total\namount of melatonin, obviously,\nbut you're also changing\nthe normal rhythms\nin how much melatonin is being released\ninto your brain and body\nacross the 365-day calendar year.\nSo while I'm somebody\nwho readily embraces\nsupplementation in various forms,\nfor things like sleep\nand focus, et cetera,\nwhen it comes to melatonin,\nI'm extremely cautious.\nAnd I think it's also\none of the few examples\nwhere a hormone is available\nwithout prescription,\nover the counter.\nYou just go into a pharmacy\nor drugstore or order online,\nthis hormone, which is known\nto have all these powerful effects.\nSo I get very, very concerned\nwhen I hear about people taking melatonin,\nespecially at the levels that are present\nin most supplements.\nIt's been recognized for a very long time,\nand in fact, there are now\ndata to support the fact\nthat animals of all\nkinds, including humans,\nwill seek out mates and\nengage in mating behavior\nmore frequently during the\nlong days of spring and summer.\nThat's right, in\nseasonally-breeding animals,\nof course, this is the case,\nbut in humans as well,\nthere is more seeking out\nof mates and mating behavior\nin longer day times of year.\nNow, you could imagine\nat least two mechanisms\nby which this occurs.\nThe first mechanism we could\neasily map to melatonin\nand the fact that melatonin is suppressive\nto various aspects of the\nso-called gonadal axis,\nwhich is basically a fancy way of saying\nthat melatonin inhibits\ntestosterone and estrogen output\nfrom the testes and from the ovaries.\nI just want to remind people\nthat both males and females\nmake testosterone and estrogen,\nalthough in different ratios, typically,\nin males versus females,\nand that both testosterone and estrogen\nare critical for the desire to\nmate and for mating behavior.\nThere's a broad misconception\nthat testosterone\nis involved in mating behavior\nand estrogen's involved\nin other behaviors,\nbut having enough estrogen is critical\nfor both males and females\nin order to maintain the desire to mate,\nand indeed the ability to mate.\nI discuss this on the episode\non optimizing testosterone and estrogen.\nSo if you'd like more details on that,\nplease see that episode of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nOkay, so if melatonin is suppressive\nto the so-called gonadal axis\nand reduces overall levels\nof testosterone and estrogen\nin males and females\nand a light inhibits melatonin,\nthen when there's more light,\nthen there's less melatonin\nand more hormone output from the gonads.\nAnd indeed that's how the system works,\nbut that's not the entire story.\nIt turns out that there is a second\nso-called parallel pathway,\nmeaning a different biological pathway\nthat operates in parallel\nto the light suppression\nof melatonin pathway\nthat provides a basis for longer days,\ninspiring more desire to mate\nand more mating behavior.\nSo if we think of the first\npathway involving melatonin\nas sort of a break on these\nreproductive hormones,\nthe second mechanism is\nmore like an accelerator\non those hormones.\nAnd yet it still involve light.\nAs I'm about to tell you,\nin animals such as mice,\nbut also in humans,\nexposure to light, in\nparticular UV blue light,\nso short wavelengths of light,\ncan trigger increases in\ntestosterone and estrogen\nand the desire to mate.\nNow what's especially important\nabout this accelerator\non the desire to mate and\nmating behavior and hormones\nis that it is driven by exposure to light,\nbut it is not the exposure\nof light to the eyes.\nIt turns out that it is\nthe exposure of your skin\nto particular wavelengths of light\nthat is triggering\nincreases in the hormones,\ntestosterone, and estrogen,\nleading to increased desire to mate.\nAs it turns out, your skin,\nwhich most of us just think of as a way\nto protect the organs of our body\nor something to hang\nclothes on or ornaments on,\nif you're somebody who\nhas earrings and so forth,\nyour skin is actually an endocrine organ,\nmeaning it is a hormone-producing\nand hormone-influencing organ.\nI promise what I'm about to tell you next\nwill forever change the way that you think\nabout your skin and light\nand the desire to mate,\nand indeed even mating behavior.\nI think the results are best understood\nby simply going through the primary data,\nmeaning the actual research on this topic.\nAnd to do so, I'm going\nto review a recent paper\nthat was published in\nthe Journal Cell Reports,\nCell Press Journal, excellent journal.\nThis is a paper that came out in 2021,\nentitled \"Skin Exposure to UVB light\ninduces a skin, brain, gonad\naxis, and sexual behavior.\nAnd I want to emphasize\nthat this was a paper\nthat focused on mice\nin order to address specific mechanisms,\nbecause in mice,\nyou can so-called knock\nout particular genes.\nYou can remove particular\ngenes to understand mechanism.\nYou just can't do that in humans\nin any kind of controlled way,\nat least not at this point in time.\nAnd this study also explores humans\nand looked at human\nsubjects, both men and women.\nThe basic finding of this study was that\nwhen mice or humans were exposed to UVB,\nmeaning ultraviolet blue light,\nso shortwave length light\nof the sort that comes\nthrough in sunshine,\nbut is also available through\nvarious artificial sources.\nIf they received enough exposure\nof that light to their skin,\nthere were increases in\ntestosterone that were observed\nwithin a very brief period of time,\nalso increases in the hormone estrogen.\nAnd I should point out that\nthe proper ratios of estrogen\nand testosterone were maintained\nin both males and females,\nat least as far as these data indicate,\nand mice tended to seek out\nmating more and mate more.\nThere were also increases\nin gonadal weight,\nliterally increases in testy\nsize and in ovarian size\nwhen mice were exposed to this UVB light\npast a certain threshold.\nNow, as I mentioned before, the\nstudy also looked at humans.\nThey did not look at\ntesty size or ovarian size\nin the human subjects.\nHowever, because they're humans,\nthey did address the psychology\nof these human beings\nand addressed whether or\nnot they had increases\nin, for instance, aggressiveness\nor in passionate feelings\nand how their perception\nof other people changed\nwhen they were getting a\nlot of UVB light exposure\nto the skin.\nSo before I get into some of\nthe more important details\nof the study and how it was done\nand how you can leverage this\ninformation for yourself,\nif you desire,\nI just want to highlight some\nof the basic findings overall.\nUVB exposure increased these\nso-called sex steroid levels\nin mice and humans.\nThe sex steroid hormones,\nwhen we say steroids,\nwe don't mean anabolic\nsteroids taken exogenously.\nI think when people\nhear the word steroids,\nthey always think steroid\nabuse or use, rather.\nSteroid hormones, such as\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nwent up when mice or humans\nhad a lot of UVB exposure\nto their skin.\nSecond of all, UVB light\nexposure to the skin\nenhanced female attractiveness,\nso the perceived attractiveness\nof females by males,\nand increased the receptiveness\nor the desire to mate in both sexes.\nUVB light exposure also\nchanged various aspects\nof female biology related to fertility,\nin particular follicle growth.\nFollicle and egg maturation\nare well-known indices of fertility,\nand of course, correlate\nwith the menstrual cycle\nin adult humans and is related overall\nto the propensity to become pregnant.\nUVB light exposure enhanced\nmaturation of the follicle,\nwhich just meant that more\nhealthy eggs were being produced.\nThese are impressive effects.\nFirst of all, they\nlooked at a large number\nof variables in the study.\nAnd the fact that they looked\nat mice and humans is terrific.\nI think that oftentimes we\nfind it hard to translate data\nfrom mice to humans.\nSo the fact that they\nlooked at both in parallel\nis wonderful.\nIn the mice and in the humans,\nthey established a protocol\nthat essentially involved\nexposing the skin to UV light\nthat was equivalent to\nabout 20 to 30 minutes\nof midday sun exposure.\nNow, of course, where\nyou live in the world\nwill dictate whether\nor not that midday sun\nis very, very bright and\nintense or is less bright.\nMaybe there's cloud cover, et cetera.\nBut since I'm imagining that\nmost people are interested\nin the ways to increase testosterone\nand/or estrogen in humans\nand are not so much interested\nin increasing testosterone in mice,\nI'm going to just review what they did\nin the human population\nor the human subjects.\nWhat they did is they had people,\nfirst of all, establish a baseline.\nAnd the way they established a baseline\nwas a little bit unusual,\nbut will make perfect sense to you.\nThey had people wear long sleeves\nand essentially cover up and\navoid sunlight for a few days\nso they could measure\ntheir baseline hormones\nin the absence of getting\na lot of UVB light exposure\nfrom the sun or from other sources.\nNow, of course, these people had access\nto artificial lights,\nbut as I've pointed out\non this podcast before,\nit's pretty unusual that\nyou'll get enough UVB exposure\nfrom artificial lights throughout the day.\nAnd in the morning you\nneed a lot of UVB exposure,\nor we should be getting a lot\nof UVB exposure to our eyes\nand to our face and to our\nskin throughout the day,\nprovided we're not getting sunburnt.\nThis is actually a healthy\nthing for mood and for energy\nthroughout the day.\nIt's only at night,\nbasically between the hours\nof about 10:00 pm and 4:00 am,\nthat even a tiny bit of UVB\nexposure from artificial sources\ncan mess us up in terms of our sleep\nand our energy levels, and so on.\nAnd that's because of\nthe potent effect of UVB\non suppressing melatonin.\nSo the point here is that\nthey establish a baseline\nwhereby people were getting\nsome artificial light exposure\nthroughout the day,\nbut they weren't getting outside a lot.\nThey weren't getting a lot of sunlight.\nAnd then they had people receive a dose\nof UVB light exposure\nthat was about 20 to 30 minutes outdoors.\nThey had people wear short\nsleeves, no hat, no sunglasses.\nSome people wore sleeveless shirts.\nThey encouraged people to wear shorts.\nSo they were indeed wearing clothing.\nThey were not naked.\nAnd they were wearing\nclothing that was culturally\nand situationally appropriate,\nat least for the part of the world\nwhere this study was done.\nAnd they had people do that\ntwo or three times a week.\nSo in terms of a protocol\nthat you might export from this study,\nbasically getting outside\nfor about 30 minutes,\ntwo or three times a week\nin a minimum of clothing,\nand yet still wearing enough clothing\nthat is culturally appropriate.\nThey were outside, they\nweren't sun bathing,\nflipping over on their back and front.\nThey were just moving about doing things.\nThey could read, they could talk,\nthey could go about other activities,\nbut they weren't wearing a broad brim hat\nor a hat of any kind,\njust getting a lot of sun\nexposure to their skin.\nThey did this for a total\nof 10 to 12 UVB treatments.\nSo this took several weeks, right?\nIt took about a month,\nif you think about it,\ntwo or three times per week\nfor a total of 10 to 12 UVB treatments.\nThese treatments, of course,\nare just being outside\nin the sun.\nAnd then they measured hormones,\nand they measured the psychology\nof these male and female adult subjects.\nLet's first look at the\npsychological changes\nthat these human subjects experienced\nafter getting 10 to 12 of\nthese UVB light exposure\noutdoor and sunlight type treatments.\nThey did this by collecting blood samples\nthroughout the study,\nand they saw significant increases\nin the hormones, beta-estradiol,\nwhich is one of the\nmajor forms of estrogen,\nprogesterone, another\nimportant steroid hormone,\nand testosterone in both men and women.\nNow, an important point is\nthat the testosterone increases\nwere significantly higher in\nmen that happened to originate\nfrom countries that had low UV exposure\ncompared to individuals from countries\nwith high UV exposure.\nNow, this ought to make sense\nif we understand a little bit\nabout how the skin functions\nas an endocrine organ.\nMany of you have probably\nheard of vitamin D3,\nwhich is a vitamin that we all make.\nMany people supplement it as well\nif they need additional vitamin D3.\nWe all require sunlight in\norder to allow vitamin D3\nto be synthesized and perform\nits roles in the body.\nAnd it turns out that\npeople who have darker skin\nactually need more vitamin D3\nand/or more sunlight exposure\nin order to activate that D3 pathway,\nthan do people with paler skin.\nAnd this should make sense to all of you\ngiven what you now\nunderstand about melanocytes,\nthat cell type that we discussed earlier,\nbecause melanocytes have\npigment within them.\nAnd if you have darker skin,\nit means that you have more melanocytes\nor that you have melanocytes\nthat are more efficient\nat creating pigment.\nAnd as a consequence,\nthe light that lands on your skin\nwill be absorbed by those melanocytes,\nand less of it is able\nto impact the D3 pathway.\nWhereas if you have pale skin,\nmore of the light that lands on your skin\ncan trigger the synthesis\nand assist the actions of vitamin D3.\nSimilarly, in this study, they found\nthat people who had paler skin\nand/or who originated from countries\nwhere they had less UVB light\nexposure across the year\nhad greater, meaning more\nsignificant, increases\nin testosterone overall\nthan did people who\nalready were getting a lot\nof UVB exposure.\nThis led them to explore\nso-called seasonal changes\nin testosterone that occurred normally\nin the absence of any\nlight exposure treatment.\nSo up until now, I've been\ntalking about the aspects\nof this study involving\npeople getting outside\nfor about 20 to 30 minutes\nper day in sunlight,\nin a minimum of clothing.\nThere was an increase\nin testosterone observed\nin both men and women.\nThe increases in testosterone were greater\nfor people that had paler\nskin than darker skin.\nSo the data I'm about to describe\nalso come from this same\npaper, but do not involve\n20 to 30 minute daily\nsun exposure protocols.\nIt's simply addressing whether\nor not testosterone levels\nchange as a function of time of year.\nThey measure testosterone\nacross the 12-month calendar.\nThis study was done on subjects living\nin the Northern Hemisphere\nfor the entire year.\nAnd so in the months of\nJanuary, February, and March,\nof course, the length of days is shortest\nand the length of nights is longest.\nAnd, of course, in the\nspring and summer months,\nJune, July, August, September, and so on,\nthe days are much longer\nand the nights are shorter.\nAnd what they observed was very obvious.\nThey observed that testosterone levels\nwere lowest in the winter months\nand were highest in the months\nof June, July, August, and September.\nNow, these are very important data.\nAt least to my knowledge,\nthese are the first data\nsystematically exploring the levels\nof sex steroid hormones in humans\nas a function of time of year\nand thereby as a function\nof how much sunlight\nexposure they're getting.\nAnd what's remarkable about these data\nis that they map very\nwell to the data in mice\nand the other data in\nthis paper on humans,\nwhich illustrate that if you're\ngetting more UVB exposure,\nyour testosterone levels are higher.\nThis study went a step further\nand explored whether or not\nthe amount of sunlight exposure\nthat one is getting to their skin\ninfluences their psychology\nin terms of whether or not\nthey have increased desire\nto mate and so on.\nIt's well known that sunlight exposure\nto the eyes can increase mood.\nAnd I talked about this\nin the podcast episode\nwith my guest, Dr. Samer Hattar,\nwho's the director of\nthe chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health.\nAnd Samer's recommendation\nis that people get as\nmuch bright light exposure\nas they safely can in the\nmorning and throughout the day\nfor sake of both sleep and energy,\nbut also for enhancing mood\nand regulating appetite.\nIn this study, it was found\nthat both males and\nfemales had higher levels\nof romantic passion after\ngetting the UV treatment.\nIn fact, some of them reported\nincreases in romantic passion\nfrom just one or two\nof these UV treatments.\nSo they didn't have to go\nthrough all 10 or 12 in order\nto get a statistically\nsignificant increase in passion.\nNow, when we talk about passion,\nas the authors of this paper acknowledge,\nthere's really two forms.\nThere is emotional and sexual,\nand they parse this pretty finely.\nI don't want to go into all the details,\nand we can provide a reference\nand link to this study\nif you'd like to look at those details.\nBut what they found was that women\nreceiving this UVB light exposure\nfocused more on increases\nin physical arousal and sexual passion,\nwhereas the men actually scored higher\non the cognitive dimensions of passion,\nsuch as obsessive thoughts\nabout their partner and so on.\nRegardless, both males and females\nexperienced and reported a\nincrease in sexual passion\nand desire to mate.\nAnd we now know there were increases\nin testosterone and estrogen,\nwhich of course could be driving\nthe psychological changes,\nalthough I'm sure that those\ninteract in both directions,\nmeaning the hormones no\ndoubt affect psychology\nand no doubt the psychology,\nthese changes in passionate feelings,\nno doubt also increased\nor changed the hormone levels as well.\nAnd I want to reemphasize\nthat there was a component of the study\nthat had no deliberate\ndaylight, sunlight exposure\nfor 20 or 30 minutes,\nbut rather just looked at hormone\nlevels throughout the year\nand found that the increase in day length\ncorrelated with increases\nin testosterone and sexual passion.\nNow, in my opinion, this\nis a very noteworthy study\nbecause it really illustrates\nthat sunlight and day length\ncan impact the melatonin pathway\nand thereby take the foot off the brake,\nso to speak, on testosterone, estrogen,\nand the desire to mate.\nIt also emphasizes that\nsunlight, UVB light,\ncan directly trigger hormone pathways\nand desire to mate and mating behavior.\nNow, this study went a step further\nin defining the precise mechanism\nby which light can\nimpact all these hormones\nand this desire to mate.\nAnd here, understanding\nthe mechanism is key\nif you want to export\na particular protocol\nor tool that you might apply.\nWe talked earlier about how\nUVB light exposure to the eyes\ntriggers activation of\nthese particular neurons\nwithin the eye,\nand then with centers deeper in the brain,\nand eventually the pineal gland\nto suppress the output of melatonin\nand thereby to allow\ntestosterone and estrogen\nto exist at higher levels\nbecause melatonin can inhibit\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nIn this study,\nthey were able to very clearly establish\nthat it is sunlight exposure to our skin\nthat is causing these hormone increases\nthat they observed in mice and humans.\nAnd the way they did that\nwas to use the so-called\nknockout technology,\nthe ability to remove specific genes\nwithin specific tissues of the body.\nAnd what they found is that UVB light,\nmeaning sunlight-exposed skin,\nupregulated, meaning\nincreased the activity\nof something called p53,\nwhich is involved in\nthe maturation of cells\nand various aspects of cellular function.\nAnd the cells they were focused\non were the keratinocytes,\nwhich you are now familiar with\nfrom our earlier discussion\nabout the fact that the\nepidermis of your skin\ncontains mainly keratinocytes\nand melanocytes.\nSunlight exposure increased\np53 activity in the skin.\nAnd p53 activity was required\nfor the downstream increases\nin ovarian size, in testicular size,\nin testosterone increases,\nin the estrogen increases,\nand the various other changes\nthat they observed at\nthe physiological level\nwhen animals or humans\nwere exposed to sunlight.\nSo these data are important\nbecause what they mean\nis that not only is it important\nthat we get sunlight\nexposure early in the day\nand throughout the day to our eyes,\nat least as much as is safely possible,\nbut that we also need to\nget UVB sunlight exposure\nonto our skin if we want to\nactivate this p53 pathway\nin keratinocytes and the\ntestosterone and estrogen increases\nthat are downstream of that p53 pathway.\nSo even though the gene knockout\nstudies were done on mice,\nthey clearly show that if\nyou remove p53 from the skin,\nthat these effects simply do not occur.\nSo in terms of thinking about a protocol\nto increase testosterone and estrogen,\nmood and feelings of passion,\nthe idea is that you would want\nto get these two to\nthree exposures per week,\nminimum of 20 to 30 minutes\nof sunlight exposure\nonto as much of your body\nas you can reasonably expose it to.\nAnd when I say reasonably, I mean,\nof course you have to\nobey cultural constraints,\ndecency constraints.\nAnd of course you have\nto also obey the fact\nthat sunlight can burn your skin.\nSo many people are probably going to ask,\n\"What happens if you wear sunscreen?\"\nWell, in theory, because\nsunscreen has UV protection,\nit would block some of these effects.\nNow I'm not suggesting\nthat people do away\nwith sunscreen entirely.\nI do hope to do an episode all\nabout sunscreen in the future\nbecause sunscreen is a bit\nof a controversial topic.\nSkin cancers are a real thing,\nand many people are especially\nprone to skin cancer,\nso you need to take that seriously.\nSome people are not very\nprone to skin cancers\nand can tolerate much more sun exposure.\nYou're probably familiar\nwith the simple fact\nthat if you've gone outside\non the beach with friends,\nsome people get burned\nvery easily, others don't.\nSo you really should prioritize the health\nand the avoidance of sunburn on your skin.\nHowever, these data and\nother data point to the fact\nthat we should all probably be striving\nto get more sunlight\nexposure onto our skin\nduring the winter months\nand still getting sunlight\nexposure onto our skin\nin the summer months,\nprovided we can do that\nwithout damaging our skin.\nAnother set of very impressive\neffects of UVB light,\nwhether or not it comes from sunlight\nor from an artificial source,\nis the effect of UVB light\non our tolerance for pain.\nIt turns out that our tolerance for pain\nvaries across the year\nand that our pain tolerance is increased\nin longer day conditions.\nAnd as we saw with the effects of UVB\non hormones and mating,\nagain, this is occurring\nvia UVB exposure to the skin\nand UVB exposure to the eyes.\nI want to just describe two studies\nthat really capture the\nessence of these results.\nI'm going to discuss these in\nkind of a top contour fashion.\nI won't go into it as quite as much depth\nas I did the last study,\nbut I will provide links\nto these studies as well.\nThe first study is entitled\nSkin Exposure to Ultraviolet\nB Rapidly Activates\nSystemic, Neuroendocrine, and\nImmunosuppressive Responses.\nAnd you might hear that and think,\n\"Oh, immunosuppressive that's bad.\"\nBut basically what they observed\nis that even one exposure\nto UVB light changed the\noutput of particular hormones\nand neurochemicals in the body,\nsuch as corticotropin\nhormone and beta-endorphins,\nwhich are these endogenous opioids.\nWe've all heard of the opioid crisis,\nwhich is people getting\naddicted to opioids\nthat they are taking in\ndrug form, pharmaceuticals.\nBut here I'm referring to endorphins\nthat our body naturally\nmanufactures and releases\nin order to counter pain\nand act as somewhat of a\npsychological soother also,\nbecause, of course, physical\npain and emotional pain\nare intimately linked\nin the brain and body.\nWhat they found was that\nexposure to UVB light\nincreased the release of\nthese beta-endorphins.\nIt caused essentially the release\nof an endogenous pain killer.\nNow, a second study that\ncame out very recently,\njust this last week, in fact,\npublished in the journal Neuron,\nCell Press journal, excellent journal,\nis entitled A Visual Circuit Related\nto the Periaqueductal Gray Area\nfor the Antinociceptive Effects\nof Bright Light Treatment.\nI'll translate a little\nbit of that for you.\nThe periaqueductal gray is\na region of the mid-brain\nthat contains a lot of neurons\nthat can release endogenous opioids,\nthings like beta-enkephalin,\nthings like enkephalin,\nthings like mu opioid.\nThese are all names of chemicals\nthat your body can manufacture\nthat act as endogenous pain killers\nand increase your tolerance for pain.\nThey actually make you\nfeel less pain overall\nby shutting down some of the neurons\nthat perceive pain or by\nreducing their activity.\nNot to a dangerous level, right?\nThey're not going to\nblock the pain response\nso that you burn yourself unnecessarily\nor harm yourself unnecessarily,\nbut they act a bit of a\npain killer from the inside.\nIf you heard the word antinociceptive,\nnociception is basically\nthe perception or the way\nin which neurons respond\nto painful stimuli.\nSo you can think of nociceptive events\nin your nervous system as painful events.\nAnd there I'm using a broad brush.\nI realized that the\nexperts in pain will say,\n\"Oh, it's not really a pain circuit,\"\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut for sake of today's discussion,\nit's fair to say that nociception\nis the perception of pain.\nSo if this title is A\nVisual Circuit Related\nto the Periaqueductal Gray,\nwhich is this area that releases\nthese endogenous opioids\nfor the antinociceptive,\nthe anti-pain effects\nof bright light treatment,\nthe key finding of this study\nis that it is light landing\non the eyes and captured\nby the specific cells I\nwas talking about earlier,\nthose intrinsically photosensitive\nmelanopsin ganglion cells\nis the long name for them,\nbut these particular neurons in your eye,\nand in my eye incidentally,\nthat communicate with\nparticular brain areas.\nThese brain areas have names.\nIf you want to know\nthem, for you aficionados\nor for you ultra curious folks,\nthey have names like the ventral\nlateral geniculate nucleus\nand the intergeniculate leaflet.\nThe names don't matter.\nThe point is that light\nlanding on the eyes\nis captured by these melanopsin cells.\nThey absorb that light,\ntranslate that light\ninto electrical signals\nthat are handed off to areas of the brain,\nsuch as the ventral geniculate.\nAnd then the ventral\ngeniculate communicates\nwith this periaqueductal gray area\nto evoke the release of\nthese endogenous opioids\nthat soothe you and lead\nto less perception of pain.\nThis is a really important study\nbecause it's long been\nknown that in longer days\nor in bright light environments,\nwe tolerate emotional\nand physical pain better.\nPrevious studies had shown\nthat it is light landing on our skin\nthat mediates that\neffect, but only in part.\nIt couldn't explain the entire effect.\nThis very recent study indicates\nthat it's also light arriving at the eyes,\nand in this case, again, UVB\nlight, ultraviolet blue light\nof the sort that comes from sunlight,\nthat is triggering these anti-pain\nor pain-relieving pathways.\nSo once again, we have\ntwo parallel pathways.\nThis is a theme you're going to hear\nover and over and over again,\nnot just in this episode,\nbut in all episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbecause this is the way that\nyour brain and body are built.\nNature rarely relies on one mechanism\nin order to create an\nimportant phenomenon,\nand pain relief is an\nimportant phenomenon.\nSo we now have at least two\nexamples of the potent effects\nof UVB light exposure to\nthe skin and to the eyes.\nOne involving activation of testosterone\nand estrogen pathways,\nas it relates to mating,\nand another that relates to\nreducing the total amount\nof pain that we experience\nin response to any painful stimuli.\nSo for those of you that are\nthinking tools and protocols,\nif you're somebody who's\nexperiencing chronic pain,\nprovided you can do it safely,\ntry to get some UVB exposure,\nideally from sunlight.\nI think the 20 to 30-minute protocol,\ntwo or three times per\nweek is an excellent one,\nseems like a fairly low\ndose of UVB light exposure.\nIt's hard to imagine getting\nmuch damage to the skin.\nOf course, if you have\nvery sensitive skin,\nor if you live in an area of the world\nthat is very, very bright\nand has intense sunlight at\nparticular times of year,\nyou'll want to be cautious.\nHeed the warnings and\nconsiderations about sunscreen\nthat I talked about earlier,\nor about wearing a hat.\nBut the point is very clear.\nMost of us should be\ngetting more UVB exposure\nfrom sunlight.\nI can already hear the\nscreams within the comments\nor rather the questions\nwithin the comments, saying,\n\"Well, what if I live\nin a part of the world\nwhere I don't get much UVB exposure?\"\nAnd I want to emphasize something\nthat I've also emphasized\nin the many discussions on this podcast\nrelated to sleep and circadian\nrhythms and alertness,\nwhich is even on a cloud-covered day,\nyou are going to get far\nmore light energy, photons\nthrough cloud cover than\nyou are going to get\nfrom an indoor light source,\nan artificial light source.\nI can't emphasize this enough.\nIf you look outside in the morning\nand you see some sunlight,\nif you see some sunlight\nthroughout the day,\nyou would do yourself a great favor\nto try and chase some of that sunlight\nand get into that sunlight\nto expose your eyes\nand your skin to that sunlight\nas much as you safely can.\nAnd when I say as much as you safely can,\nnever ever look at any light,\nartificial, sunlight, or otherwise,\nthat's so bright that\nit's painful to look at.\nIt's fine to get that light\narriving on your eyes indirectly.\nIt's fine to wear eyeglasses\nor contact lenses.\nIn fact, if you think about\nthe biology of the eye\nand the way that those lenses work,\nthat you will just serve\nto focus that light\nonto the very cells that\nyou want those light beams\nto be delivered to,\nwhereas sunglasses that\nare highly reflective\nor trying to get your sunlight exposure\nthrough a windshield of a car\nor through a window simply won't work.\nI'm sorry to tell you,\nbut most windows are designed\nto filter out the UVB light.\nAnd if you're somebody who's\nreally keen on blue blockers\nand you're wearing your\nblue blockers all day,\nwell, don't wear them outside.\nAnd in fact, you're probably\ndoing yourself a disservice\nby wearing them in the\nmorning and in the daytime.\nThere certainly is a\nplace for blue blockers\nin the evening and nighttime,\nif you're having issues with\nfalling and staying asleep.\nBut if you think about it, blue blockers,\nwhat they're really doing\nis blocking those short wavelength,\nUVB wavelengths of light\nthat you so desperately need\nto arrive at your retina\nand of course, also onto your skin\nin order to get these\npowerful biological effects\non hormones and on pain reduction.\nAnd in terms of skin exposure,\nthese data also might make\nyou think a little bit\nabout whether or not you\nshould wear short sleeves\nor long sleeves,\nwhether or not you want to wear\nshorts or a skirt or pants.\nIt's all going to depend\non the context of your life\nand the social and other variables\nthat are important, of course.\nI don't know each and every\none of your circumstances,\nso I can't tell you to do\nX or Y or Z, nor would I,\nbut you might take into consideration\nthat it is the total\namount of skin exposure\nthat is going to allow you to\ncapture more or fewer photons,\ndepending on, for instance,\nif you're completely cloaked in clothing\nand you're just exposed in\nthe hands, neck, and face\nsuch as I am now,\nor whether or not you're\noutside in shorts and a T-shirt,\nyou're going to get very,\nvery different patterns\nof biological signaling activation\nin those two circumstances.\nMany of you I'm guessing are wondering\nwhether or not you should\nseek out UVB exposure\nthroughout the entire year\nor only in the summer months.\nAnd that's sort of going to depend\non whether or not you\nexperience depression\nin the winter months,\nso called seasonal effective disorder.\nSome people have mild, some\npeople have severe forms\nof seasonal effective disorder.\nSome people love the fall and\nwinter and the shorter days.\nThey love bundling up.\nThey love the leaves.\nThey love the snow, they love the cold,\nand they don't experience\nthose psychological lows.\nSo it varies tremendously.\nAnd there are genetic differences\nand birthplace origin differences\nthat relate to all this,\nbut really it has to be considered\non a case-by-case basis.\nI personally believe,\nand this was reinforced\nby the director of the chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes of\nMental Health, Samer Hattar,\nthat we would all do well\nto get more UVB exposure\nfrom sunlight throughout the entire year,\nprovided we aren't burning our skin\nor damaging our eyes in some way.\nIn addition to that,\nduring the winter months,\nif you do experience some drop in energy\nor increase in depression\nor psychological lows,\nit can be very beneficial\nto access a SAD lamp.\nOr if you don't want to buy a SAD lamp,\n'cause oftentimes they\ncan be very expensive,\nyou might do well to simply\nget a LED lighting panel.\nI've described one before.\nAnd I want to emphasize that I\nhave no affiliation whatsoever\nto these commercial sources,\nbut I've described one before\nand I'll describe it again.\nAnd we can provide a link to\na couple examples of these\nin the show, in the show\nnote captions, excuse me.\nThis is a 930 to 1,000\nlux, L-U-X, light source\nthat's designed for drawing.\nIt's literally a drawing box.\nIt's a thin panel. It's\nabout the size of a laptop.\nVery inexpensive compared\nto the typical SAD lamp.\nI actually have one,\nand I position it on my desk all day long.\nI also happen to have\nskylights above my desk.\nI'm fairly sensitive to\nthe effects of light.\nSo in longer days I feel much better\nthan I do in shorter days.\nI've never suffered\nfrom full-blown seasonal\neffective disorder,\nbut I keep that light\nsource on throughout the day\nthroughout the year.\nBut I also make it a point to\nget outside and get sunlight\nearly in the morning and several\ntimes throughout the day.\nAnd if it's particularly overcast outside\nor there just doesn't seem\nto be a lot of sunlight\ncoming through those clouds,\nI will try to look at that light source\na little bit more each day\nin order to trigger these mechanisms.\nNow, some people may\ndesire to get UVB exposure\nto their skin and they want to do that\nthrough sources other than sunlight.\nAnd there it's a little\nbit more complicated.\nThere are, of course, tanning salons,\nwhich basically are beds of UVB light.\nThat's really all they are.\nI've never been to one.\nI know people do frequent them\nin certain parts of the world.\nThere, of course, people\nare covering their eyes.\nThey are only getting UVB\nexposure to their skin, typically\nbecause the UVB exposure,\nor intensities rather,\ntend to be very, very high.\nAnd so you can actually damage your eyes.\nIf you're looking at a very, very bright\nartificial UVB source up close.\nSo you really have to explore\nthese options for yourself.\nSunlight of course, being the original\nand still the best way\nto get UVB exposure.\nSo without knowing your particular\ncircumstances, finances,\ngenetics, or place of origin, et cetera,\nI can't know whether or not\nyou need to use artificial sources.\nYou're going to have to gauge that.\nMeanwhile, getting outside, looking at\nand getting some exposure\nof UVB onto your skin\nis going to be beneficial\nfor the vast majority of people out there.\nAnd in fact, it's even\ngoing to be beneficial\nfor people that are blind.\nPeople that are blind,\nprovided they still have eyes,\noften maintain these melanopsin cells.\nSo even if you're low vision or no vision,\ngetting UVB exposure to your eyes\ncan be very beneficial for sake of mood,\nhormone pathways, pain\nreduction, and so forth.\nA cautionary note, people who\nhave retinitis pigmentosa,\nmacular degeneration, or glaucoma,\nas well as people who are\nespecially prone to skin cancers\nshould definitely consult\nwith your ophthalmologist\nand dermatologist before\nyou start increasing\nthe total amount of UVB exposure\nthat you're getting from any\nsource, sunlight or otherwise.\nThere are additional, very\ninteresting and powerful effects\nof UVB light, in particular\non immune function.\nAll the organs of our\nbody are inside our skin.\nAnd so information about\nexternal conditions,\nmeaning the environment that we're in,\nneed to be communicated to the\nvarious organs of our body.\nSome of them have more direct access\nto what's going on outside.\nSo for instance, the cells in your brain\nthat reside right over\nthe roof of your mouth,\nyour hypothalamus, they\ncontrol hormone output,\nand they control the biological functions\nthat we call circadian functions,\nthe ones that change every 24 hours.\nWell, those are just\none or two connections,\nmeaning synapses away from\nthose cells in your eye\nthat perceive UB, UVB light, excuse me.\nOther organs of your\nbody, such as your spleen,\nwhich is involved in the\ncreation of molecules\nand cells that combat infection,\nwell, those are a long ways away\nfrom those cell in your eye.\nAnd in fact, they're a long\nways away from your skin.\nThere are beautiful studies showing\nthat if we get more UVB\nexposure from sunlight\nor from appropriate artificial sources,\nthat spleen and immune\nfunction are enhanced,\nand there's a very logical,\nwell-established circuit\nas to how that happens.\nYour brain actually\nconnects to your spleen.\nNow, it's not the case\nthat you can simply think,\n\"Okay, spleen, turn on,\nrelease killer cells,\ngo out and combat infection.\"\nHowever, UVB light arriving on the eyes\nis known to trigger\nactivation of the neurons\nwithin the so-called\nsympathetic nervous system.\nThese neurons are part of the larger thing\nthat we call the autonomic nervous system,\nmeaning it's below or not\naccessible by conscious control.\nIt's the thing that\ncontrols your heartbeat,\ncontrols your breathing\nand that also activates\nor flips on the switch\nof your immune system.\nWhen we get a lot of\nUVB light in our eyes,\nor I should say sufficient\nUVB light in our eyes,\na particular channel, a\nparticular set of connections\nwithin the sympathetic\nnervous system is activated,\nand our spleen deploys\nimmune cells and molecules\nthat scavenge for and combat infection.\nSo if you've noticed that\nyou get fewer colds and flus\nand other forms of illness\nin the summer months,\npart of that could be because\nof the increase in temperature\nin your environment,\nbecause typically longer\ndays are associated\nwith more warmth in your environment\nas opposed to winter days,\nwhich are short when it\ntends to be colder out.\nWell, that's true, but it's also the case\nthat people around you\nhave fewer colds and flus\nand that you will get infected\nwith fewer colds and flus\nand other infections,\nbecause if those infections,\nwhether or not they're bacterial or viral,\narrive in your body,\nright, if you inhale them\nor they get into your\nmouth or on your skin,\nyour spleen meets those\ninfections with a greater output.\nIn other words, the soldiers\nof your immune system,\nthe chemicals and cell\ntypes of your immune system\nthat combat infection\nare in a more ready,\ndeployed stance, if you will.\nIf you want to know more\nabout the immune system\nand immune function,\nI did an entire episode\nabout the immune system\nand the brain, you can find\nthat at hubermanlab.com.\nWe talk about cytokines,\nwe talk about killer cells,\nB cells, T cells, et cetera,\na lot of detail there.\nSo we often think about the summer months\nand the spring months as fewer\ninfections floating around.\nBut in fact, there aren't fewer\ninfections floating around.\nWe are simply better at\ncombating those infections,\nand therefore there's less\ninfection floating around.\nSo we are still confronted\nwith a lot of infections.\nWe're just able to combat them better.\nWhat does this mean in terms of a tool?\nWhat it means is that\nduring the winter months,\nwe should be especially\nconscious of accessing UVB light\nto enhance our spleen function,\nto make sure that our\nsympathetic nervous system\nis activated to a sufficient level\nto keep our immune system\ndeploying all those killer T cells\nand B cells and cytokines\nso that when we encounter the infections,\nas we inevitably will, right,\nwe're constantly being bombarded\nwith potential infections,\nthat we can combat those infections well.\nAnd as just a brief aside,\nbut I should mention, a brief aside\nthat's related to tens of\nthousands of quality studies,\nit is well known that\nwound healing is faster\nwhen we are getting\nsufficient UVB exposure.\nTypically, that's associated\nwith the longer days\nof spring and summer.\nIt is known that turnover of hair cells,\nthe very cells that\ngive rise to hair cells\nare called stem cells.\nThey live in little\nso-called niches in our skin\nwith these hair stem cells,\nand your hair grows faster in longer days.\nThat too is triggered by UVB exposure,\nnot just to the skin, but to the eyes.\nThat's right.\nThere was a study published\nin the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\na couple of years ago that\nshowed that the exposure\nof those melanopsin\nganglion cells in your eyes\nis absolutely critical for\ntriggering the turnover\nof stem cells in both the skin and hair,\nand also turns out in nails.\nSo if you've noticed that your skin,\nyour hair and your nails look\nbetter and turn over more,\nmeaning grow faster in longer days,\nthat is not on a coincidence.\nThat is not just your perception.\nIn fact, hair grows more,\nskin turns over more,\nmeaning it's going to look more youthful.\nYou're going to essentially\nremove older skin cells\nand replace them with new cells,\nand all the renewing cells\nand tissues of our body\nare going to proliferate,\nare going to recreate themselves more\nwhen we're getting sufficient\nUVB light to our eyes\nand also to our skin.\nAnd so while some of you\nmay think of light therapies\nsuch as red light\ntherapies or UVB therapies\nas kind of new agey, or just biohacking,\nagain, a phrase I don't particularly like,\nthis notion of biohacking,\n'cause it implies using\none thing for a purpose\nthat it was never tended to have,\nwell, it turns out that\nUVB exposure and red light,\nas we'll soon see, is a very potent form\nof increasing things like\nwound healing and skin health\nfor very logical\nmechanistically backed reasons.\nSo while I can't account for everything\nthat's being promoted out there\nin terms of this light source\nwill help your skin look more youthful\nor will help heal your scars,\nthe mechanistic basis for\nlight having those effects\nmakes total sense.\nBut what you should consider, however,\nis that if the particular light therapy\nthat you're considering\ninvolves very local application\nrather than illuminating\nbroad swaths of skin,\nand if it has no\ninvolvement with the eyes,\nmeaning there's no delivery\nof UVB or red light\nor the other light therapy to the eyes,\nit's probably not going to\nbe as potent a treatment\nas would a more systemic activation\nof larger areas of skin and the eyes.\nNow, again, a cautionary note,\nI don't want people taking\ntechnologies that were designed\nfor local application and\nbeaming those into the eyes.\nThat could be very, very bad\nand damaging to your\nretinal and other tissues.\nCertainly, wouldn't want\nyou taking bright light\nof very high intensity of any kind\nand getting cavalier about that.\nTypically, the local\nillumination of say a wound\nor a particular patch of acne\nor some other form of skin treatment\ninvolves very high intensity light.\nAnd if the intensity is too high,\nyou can actually damage that skin.\nAnd so as we'll talk\nabout in a few moments,\nmost of those therapies for modifying skin\ninvolve actually burning\noff a small, very thin layer\nat the top of the epidermis\nin efforts to trigger the renewal\nor the activation of stem cells\nthat will replenish that with new cells.\nSo there's a fine line to be\nhad between light therapies\nthat are very localized and intense,\nwhich are designed to damage skin\nand cause reactivation of new stem cells,\nwhether that's hair cells\nor skin cells, et cetera,\nversus systemic activation\nacross broad swaths of skin\nand the eyes.\nYou really have to consider\nthis on a case-by-case basis,\nbut at least for now just consider\nthat increases in\nhormones, reduction in pain\nby way of increases in enkephalin\nand other endogenous opioids,\nimproving immune status\nby activating the spleen,\nand so on, and so on\nreally are all the downstream consequence\nof illuminating large swaths of skin\nand making sure that those\nneurons within the eye\nget their adequate UVB exposure\nor other light wavelength exposure,\nnot simply beaming a\nparticular wavelength of light\nat a particular location on the body\nand hoping that that\nparticular illumination\nat a particular location on the body\nis going to somehow change\nthe biology at that location.\nOur biology just really\ndoesn't work that way.\nIt's possible, but in general,\nsystemic effects through\nbroad scale illumination\nand illumination to the eye,\ncombined with local\ntreatments are very likely\nto be the ones that have the most success.\nNow, I'd like to shift our attention\nto the effects of light\non mood more specifically.\nWe talked about this\nin terms of seasonal effective disorder,\nbut many of us don't suffer\nfrom seasonal effective disorder.\nSo I'd like to drill a little deeper\ninto how light impacts mood.\nAnd here, I want to, again,\nparaphrase the statements\nof Dr. Samer Hattar\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health,\nI should mention the director\nof the chronobiology unit\nat the National Institutes\nof Mental Health\nand perhaps one of the top one\nto two to three world experts\nin how light can impact mood, appetite,\ncircadian rhythms, and so forth.\nSamer stated on the podcast,\nand he said in various\nother venues as well,\nthat getting as much UVB light\nin our eyes and on our skin\nin the early day and throughout the day\nas is safely possible is going\nto be beneficial for mood.\nThere's also another time of day,\nor rather I should say a time of night\nin which UVB can be leveraged\nin order to improve mood,\nbut it's actually the\ninverse of everything\nwe've been talking about up until now.\nWe have a particular neural\ncircuit that originates\nwith those melanopsin cells in our eye\nthat bypass all the areas of the brain\nassociated with circadian clocks,\nso everything related to\nsleep and wakefulness,\nthat's specifically\ndedicated to the pathways\ninvolving the release of\nmolecules like dopamine,\nthe neuromodulator that's\nassociated with motivation,\nwith feeling good, with feeling\nlike there's possibility\nin the world, and so on and so forth,\nand other molecules as well,\nincluding serotonin and some\nof those endogenous opioids\nthat we talked about before.\nThat particular pathway\ninvolves a brain structure\ncalled the perihabenular nucleus.\nThe perihabenular nucleus gets input\nfrom the cells in the eye\nthat respond to UVB light,\nand frankly, to bright light\nof other wavelengths as well,\n'cause as you recall, if\na light is bright enough,\neven if it's not UV or blue light,\nit can activate those cells in the eye.\nThose cells in the eye\ncommunicate to the perihabenular nucleus.\nAnd as it turns out, if\nthis pathway is activated\nat the wrong time of each 24-hour cycle,\nmood gets worse, dopamine\noutput gets worse,\nmolecules that are there\nspecifically to make us feel good,\nactually are reduced in their output.\nSo while UVB exposure in the\nmorning and throughout the day\nis going to be very\nimportant for elevating\nand maintaining elevated mood,\navoiding UVB light at\nnight is actually a way\nin which we can prevent activation\nof this eye to perihabenular pathway\nthat can actually turn on depression.\nTo be very direct and succinct about this,\navoid exposure to UVB light\nfrom artificial sources\nbetween the hours of 10:00 pm and 4:00 am.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho suffers from low mood\nand overall has a kind of mild depression\nor even severe depression,\nof course, please see a psychiatrist,\nsee a trained psychologist,\nget that treated,\nbut you would do especially\nwell to avoid UVB exposure\nfrom artificial sources, not\njust from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am,\nbut really be careful about\ngetting too much exposure to UVB\neven in the late evening,\nso 8:00 pm perhaps to 4:00 am.\nI can't emphasize this enough,\nthat if you view UVB light,\nyou activate those neurons\nin your eye very potently.\nAnd if those cells communicate\nto the perihabenular nucleus,\nwhich they do,\nyou will truncate or reduce\nthe amount of dopamine\nthat you release.\nSo if you want to keep your mood elevated,\nget a lot of light, UVB\nlight, throughout the day,\nand at night, really be cautious\nabout getting UVB exposure\nfrom artificial sources.\nNow let's say you're somebody\nwho has no issues with mood.\nYou're just the happiest\nperson all year long,\nor maybe you just have subtle\nvariations in your mood.\nYou feel great about that.\nTurns out that you still\nwant to be very careful\nabout light exposure\nbetween the hours of 10:00\npm or so, and 4:00 am,\nin fact, even during sleep.\nThere's a recent study that just came out\nin the Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences,\nand it's entitled Light\nExposure During Sleep\nImpairs Cardiometabolic Function.\nThis is a very interesting study\nwhere they took human\nsubjects, young adults,\nand having them sleep in rooms\nthat had different lighting conditions,\neither dim light or slightly bright light.\nNow, many people can't fall\nasleep in brightly lit rooms,\nso they acknowledge this.\nThese were not very brightly lit rooms.\nThese were rooms that\nhad just a little bit\nof overhead room lighting, a hundred lux,\nwhich is not very bright at all.\nOr they had them sleep in a\nroom that had very dim light,\nwhich is less than three lux.\nIf you want to get a sense\nof how bright three lux is\nversus a hundred lux,\nI would encourage you to download\nthe free app Light Meter.\nI have no relationship to the app.\nIt's a pretty cool app, however.\nI've used it for a long time,\nwhere you can basically point your phone\nat a particular light\nsource, sun or otherwise,\nand you just press the button\nand it'll give you an\napproximate readout of lux,\nwhich is the light intensity\nthat the phone happens\nto be staring out at\nat that location.\nIt's not exact, but it's a pretty good\nback-of-the-envelope\nmeasure of light intensity.\nSo these subjects were either\nsleeping in a very dim room,\nthree lux is very, very dim,\nor a somewhat dim room, a hundred lux.\nIn this study, they measured\nthings like melatonin levels.\nThey looked at heart rate,\nthey looked at measures of\ninsulin and glucose management.\nNow, in previous episodes,\nI've talked about how\nglucose, blood sugar,\nis regulated by insulin\nbecause you don't want your glucose levels\nto be too high, hyperglycemia,\nor too low, hypoglycemia.\nAnd the hormone insulin is\ninvolved in sequestering\nand shuttling glucose in the bloodstream.\nBasically, how well you manage\nglucose in the bloodstream\ncan be indirectly measured\nby your insulin levels.\nAnd it's well known that sleep deprivation\ncan disrupt glucose regulation by insulin.\nHowever, in this study,\nsubjects were sleeping\nthe whole night through.\nIt just so happens that some\nof the subjects were sleeping\nin this very dimly lit room, three lux,\nand other subjects were sleeping\nin a somewhat dimly lit\nroom, a hundred lux.\nWhat's incredible about this study\nis that both rooms were\nsufficiently dimmed\nthat melatonin levels were\nnot altered in either case.\nThis is really key.\nIt's not as if one group\nexperienced a lot of bright light\nthrough their eyelids and others did not.\nMelatonin levels were not disrupted.\nAnd given how potently\nlight can inhibit melatonin,\nthis speaks to the fact\nthat this very dim condition of three lux\nand the somewhat dim\ncondition of a hundred lux\nwas not actually perceived by the subjects\nnor was it disrupting\nthese hormone pathways.\nThey also looked at glucose responses.\nThey had people essentially\ntake a fasting glucose test\nin different conditions.\nI won't go into all the details,\nbut here's what they found.\nIn healthy adults, even\njust one night of sleeping\nin a moderately lit environment,\nthis hundred lux\nenvironment, caused changes,\nincreases in nighttime heart rate,\nwhich means that the\nsympathetic nervous system\nwas overly active as compared to people\nthat slept in a completely dark\nor in a very, very dimly lit room.\nDecreases in heart rate variability,\nand here I should point out\nthat heart rate variability\nor HRV is a good thing, we\nwant heart rate variability.\nSo they saw increases in heart rate,\ndecreases in heart rate variability,\nand increases in next\nmorning insulin resistance,\nwhich is an indication that\nglucose management is suffering.\nSo this is powerful.\nThe results of this study\nessentially indicate\nthat even just one night of\nsleeping the whole night through\nin a dimly lit environment\nis disrupting the way\nthat our autonomic nervous\nsystem is functioning,\naltering so called autonomic tone,\nmaking us less relaxed\nis probably the best way\nto describe it,\neven though we are asleep,\ndisrupting the way\nthat our cardiometabolic\nfunction operates,\nsuch that we have lower\nheart rate variability\nand increased insulin resistance.\nThis is not a good thing\nfor any of us to experience.\nSo while we've mainly been talking\nabout the positive effects of UVB light\nand other forms of light,\nnow we have two examples.\nOne from the work of Hattar and colleagues\nshowing that UVB exposure\nvia the perihabenula\ncan diminish the output of dopamine\nand other molecules that make us feel good\nif that UVB exposure is\nin the middle of the night\nor late evening.\nAnd now we have yet\nanother study performed,\nin this case, in humans,\nindicating that even if we fall asleep\nand sleep the whole night through,\nif the room that we're\nsleeping in has too many lux,\ntoo much light energy,\nthat light energy is no doubt\ngoing through the eyelids,\nwhich it can, activating\nthe particular cells\nin the eye that trigger an increase\nin sympathetic nervous system activation\nand disrupting our metabolism.\nAnd this study rests on a\nnumber of other recent studies\npublished in Cell, which\nis a superb journal,\nand other journals, showing\nthat during the course\nof a healthy, deep night's sleep,\nour body actually transitions\nthrough various forms\nof metabolic function.\nWe actually experience\nketosis-like states.\nWe experience glucogenesis.\nWe experience different\nforms of metabolism\nassociated with different stages of sleep,\nnot something that we're\ngoing into in depth\nin this podcast, we will\nin a future podcast.\nWhat this study shows is that\nlight exposure even in sleep\nis disrupting our autonomic, in this case,\nthe sympathetic arm of the\nautonomic nervous system\nin ways that are disrupting\nmetabolism, probably in sleep,\nbut certainly outside of\nsleep so that we wake up\nand have our first meal of the day.\nOr even if you're intermittent fasting,\nyou eat that first meal of the day,\nif your sleep is taking\nplace in an environment\nthat's overly illuminated,\nwell, that's disrupting\nyour cardiac function\nand your metabolism.\nI've been talking a lot about UVB light,\nwhich is short wavelength light.\nSo UV light, blue light,\nmaybe even some blue green light,\nthat's going to be short wavelength light.\nNow, I'd like to shift our attention\nto the other end of the spectrum,\nmeaning the light spectrum,\nto talk about red light\nand infrared light,\nwhich is long wavelength light.\nMany so-called low level light therapies,\nthe acronym is LLLT, low\nlevel light therapies,\ninvolve the use of red\nlight and infrared light.\nSometimes, low level light\ntherapies involve the use of UVB,\nbut more often than not these days,\nwhen we hear LLLT, low\nlevel light therapy,\nit's referring to red light\nand near-infrared light therapies.\nLow level light therapies have\nbeen shown to be effective\nfor a huge number of biological phenomenon\nand medical treatments.\nI can't summarize all of those now.\nIt would take me many, many hours.\nIt would be an effective\nepisode for curing insomnia,\nbut it wouldn't inform you\nproperly about the use of light\nfor your health.\nRather, I'd like to just emphasize\nsome of the top contour of those studies\nand point out that for instance,\nlow level light therapy\nwith infrared light\nhas been shown to be effective\nfor the treatment of acne\nand other sorts of skin lesions.\nThere have been some really\nnice studies actually\nwhere they use subjects as\ntheir own internal control.\nSo people, believe it or not,\nagreed to have half of their face\nilluminated with red light\nor near-infrared light,\nand the other half of their\nface serve as a control,\nand to do that for\nseveral weeks at a time.\nAnd you can see pretty\nimpressive reductions\nin skin lesions, reductions\nin scars from acne,\nand reduction in acne lesions themselves,\nmeaning the accumulation of new acne cysts\nwith low level light therapy,\nusing red light and infrared light.\nSometimes however, there is\na resistance of that acne\nto the low level light therapy,\nsuch that people will get\nan initial improvement,\nand then it'll go away despite\ncontinuing the treatment.\nSo you're probably asking, or\nat least you should be asking,\nhow is it that shining\nred light on our skin\ncan impact things like acne\nand wound healing, et cetera?\nWell, to understand that,\nwe have to think back\nto the beginning of the episode\nwhere I described how\nlong wavelength light,\nsuch as red light and near-infrared light,\nwhich is even longer than red light,\ncan pass through certain\nsurfaces, including our skin.\nSo our skin has an epidermis,\nwhich is on the outside,\nand the dermis, which\nis in the deeper layers.\nRed light and infrared light can pass down\ninto the deeper layers of our skin,\nwhere it can change the metabolic function\nof particular cells.\nSo let's just take acne as an example.\nWithin the dermis, the\ndeep layers of our skin,\nwe have what are called sebaceous glands\nthat actually make the oil\nthat is present in our skin.\nThose sebaceous glands are\noften nearby hair follicles.\nSo if you've ever had a\ninfected hair follicle,\nthat's not a coincidence\nthat hair follicles tend to get infected.\nPart of it is because there's\nactually a portal down\nand around the hair follicle,\nbut the sebaceous gland is\nwhere the oil is created.\nThat is going to give rise to,\nfor instance, acne lesions.\nAlso, in the dermis, in the\ndeep layers of the skin,\nare the melanocytes.\nThey're not just in the epidermis,\nthey're also in the\ndeeper layers of the skin.\nAnd you have the stem cells that give rise\nto additional skin cells.\nIf the top layers of the\nepidermis are damaged,\nthose stem cells can become activated.\nAnd you also have the stem cells\nthat give rise to hair follicles.\nSo by shining red light\nor near-infrared light\non a localized patch of skin,\nprovided that red light is\nnot of such high intensity\nthat it burns the skin,\nbut is of sufficient\nintensity that it provides\njust a little bit of damage to\nthe upper layers of the skin,\nthe epidermis,\nand that it triggers\ncertain biological pathways\nwithin the cells of the sebaceous gland\nand the stem cells within\nthe hair cell niche\nand the stem cells in skin,\nwhat happens is the top layers of the skin\nare basically burned off\nby a very low level of burn\nand/or the cells in the deeper layer\nstart to churn out new cells,\nwhich go and rescue the lesion,\nessentially clear out the\nlesion and replace that lesion\nwith healthy skin cells.\nThis does work in the\ncontext of wound healing,\ngetting scars to disappear.\nIt also works to remove certain\npatches of pigmentation.\nThere are sometimes cases\nwhere people will get a red blotchiness\ndue to certain skin conditions\nor some darker pigmentation\nthat they want remove,\nor that they need removed,\nbecause it's a potential\nskin cancer threat.\nNow, how is red light actually doing it\nwithin the cells of the sebaceous gland,\nthe stem cells, et cetera?\nWell, long wavelength light\ncan actually get deep into the skin,\nI mentioned that before,\nbut can also get into individual cells\nand can access the so-called organelles,\nwhich I described at the\nbeginning of the episode.\nIn particular, they can\naccess the mitochondria,\nwhich are responsible for producing ATP.\nNow, the simple way to think about this\nfor sake of this discussion\nis that as cells age,\nand in particular, in very\nmetabolically active cells,\nthey accumulate what are called ROSs,\nreactive oxygen species.\nAnd as reactive oxygen species go up,\nATP energy production in\nthose cells tends to go down.\nIt's a general statement,\nbut it's a general statement\nthat in most cases is true.\nThere are some minor exceptions\nthat don't concern us\nthat have to do with cell\ntypes different than the ones\nthat I'm talking about now.\nSo the way to think about\nthis is that red light passes\ninto the deeper layers of the skin,\nactivates mitochondria,\nwhich increases ATP,\nand directly or indirectly reduces\nthese reactive oxygen species.\nThese reactive oxygen\nspecies are not good.\nWe don't want them.\nThey cause cellular\ndamage, cellular death.\nAnd for the most part just inhibit the way\nthat our cells work.\nSo if you've heard of red light\nor near-infrared light therapies\ndesigned to heal skin\nor improve skin quality\nor remove lesions,\nor get rid of scars or\nunwanted pigmentation,\nthat is not pseudoscience,\nthat is not woo science.\nThat is grounded in the very\nbiology of how light interacts\nwith mitochondria and\nreactive oxygen species.\nSome of you may also find\nit interesting to note\nthat some of the cream-based treatments\nfor acne, for instance,\nlike retinoic acid, Retin-A,\nis actually a derivative of vitamin A.\nAnd the pathway involving\nretinoic acid and vitamin A,\nbelieve it or not,\nis very similar to the\nnatural biological pathway\nby which photopigments in the\neye convert light information\ninto biological changes\nwithin those cells.\nSo the key point here is that light\nis activating particular pathways in cells\nthat can either drive death of cells\nor can make those cells\nessentially younger\nby increasing ATP\nby way of improving\nmitochondrial function.\nAnd in recent years, there have been some\njust beautiful examples that exist,\nnot only in the realm of skin biology,\nbut in the realm of\nneurobiology whereby red light\nand near-infrared light\ncan actually be used\nto enhance the function of the cells\nthat, for instance, allow us to see better\nand indeed cells that\nallow us to think better.\nSo now I'd like to review those data\nbecause not only are they\ninteresting in their own right,\nbut they also point to\nsome very interesting\nand powerful application of\nlow-cost or zero-cost tools\nthat we can use to improve our vision.\nIf you are somebody who's\ninterested in the use of red light\nor near-infrared light,\nso-called LLLT, low level light therapies,\nfor treatment of dermatologic issues,\nso anything related to skin,\nI will include a link to a\nexcellent set of reviews.\nThe first one is Light-emitting\nDiodes in Dermatology:\nA Systematic Review of\nRandomized Controlled Trials.\nThat one includes review of a\nvery large number of studies,\ncame out just a few years ago in 2018,\nand I think is very clearly\nand cleanly laid out for anyone to access.\nAnd you can see the degree of effects\nof red light, for instance,\non treatment of acne\nor scarring, et cetera.\nAnd I'll also provide a\nlink to another review,\nwhich is Low-level Light Therapy in Skin:\nStimulating, Healing, and Restoring.\nSo for those of you that\nare interested, again,\nin dermatologic issues\nand the kind of restoring youthfulness\nand the kind of general themes\nof anti-aging and longevity\nand how red light therapies\ncan be used for that,\nI would encourage you to\ntake a look at those reviews.\nWhat you're going to find\nis that rarely, if ever,\nis there a study looking at whole body\nred light illumination\nfor sake of treating and improving skin.\nAnd I mention this because\nI get a lot of questions\nabout infrared sauna\nand global illumination\nwith red lights.\nWe'll talk more about cases\nwhere global illumination\nof your whole body\nor your whole face with\nred lights might be useful,\nbut in terms of infrared sauna,\nI've mentioned on this podcast before,\nand I will certainly go deeper on this\nin an upcoming episode,\nall about the use of heat and temperature\nfor augmenting our biology,\nbut in general, infrared\nsaunas don't get hot enough,\ntemperature-wise, in order to trigger some\nof the important effects on growth hormone\nand heat shock proteins and\nsome of the other things\nthat sauna has been shown\nto be excellent for.\nThat's a general statement.\nI realize there are some infrared saunas\nthat do get hot enough.\nThere are very few data on the use\nof whole body illumination\nwith infrared saunas\nthat really point to any specific\nmechanistically supported effects.\nAlmost all the positive effects\nthat you're going to see\nof red light and\nlow-level light therapies,\ncertainly the ones\ndiscussed in the reviews\nthat I just mentioned,\nare going to be the consequence\nof very directed illumination\nof particular patches of skin\nthat are seeking repair,\nthat people are seeking the repair of.\nSo again, I don't want to\ndisparage infrared saunas,\nbut in general, they don't get hot enough\nto trigger most of the positive effects\nthat sauna have been demonstrated to have.\nAnd it's unclear at all\nas to whether or not\nthey can enhance skin\nquality, youthfulness,\nrestore top layers of\nskin that are damaged,\nrepair acne, et cetera.\nSo more on heat saunas and infrared saunas\nand their comparison\nin an upcoming episode.\nSo let's talk about a\nclear set of examples\nwhere red light and near-infrared light\nhave been shown to have\npositive effects on our health.\nAnd these are the data that I\nreferred to at the beginning\nof the episode from Dr. Glen Jeffery\nat University College London,\nwho, again, is a longstanding member\nof the neuroscience community,\nworking on visual neuroscience,\nand who over the last decade or so\nhas really emphasized the\nexploration of red light\nand near-infrared light for restoration\nof neuronal function as we age.\nThis is absolutely critical.\nWe know that we don't\naccumulate many new brain cells\nas we get older.\nAnd in some areas of our nervous system,\nsuch as our neural retina,\nwhich is the part of our eye,\nthat's responsible for\ntranslating light information\nto electrical signals so that we can see,\nwe don't get any new cells after the time\nin which we were born.\nSo the ability to keep our neurons healthy\nis extremely important\nfor our visual system,\nextremely important for our hippocampus,\nan area of the brain involved in memory.\nAnd I should just mention that even\nif people don't get Alzheimer's,\nthere's always going to be some degree\nof age-related dementia.\nSadly, nobody is as cognitively sharp\nin the years before they die,\nas they are 20 years before that.\nIt's just never the case.\nWe're all getting worse at thinking,\nfeeling, perceiving, et cetera.\nThe question is how quickly\nwe are getting worse.\nSo any mechanism by which we can preserve\nor reverse neuronal function\nturns out to be immensely beneficial.\nThe Jeffery Lab has published\ntwo studies in recent years\non humans that looked\ndirectly, no pun intended,\nat how red light and near-infrared light\ncan improve visual function.\nI'm going to describe the\nparameters of those studies.\nAnd then I'm going to describe\nwhat they found, exactly.\nThe mechanistic motivation\nfor these studies, again,\ntraces back to this effect\nof light on mitochondria.\nSo to go a little bit deeper\ninto that mechanism just briefly\nso that you can frame\nany potential protocol\nthat you would develop,\nwhen light arrives on\ncells, including neurons,\nthat light can penetrate into the cells\nif it's of the appropriate wavelength.\nRed light can do that,\nit can get into cells,\nit can access the mitochondria,\nit can increase ATP.\nIn general, anytime ATP is doing its thing\nto increase energy in cells,\nit's involving this thing\ncalled cytochrome c,\nwhich is an oxidase.\nAnytime you hear ase, A-S-E, in biology,\nit's going to be an enzyme.\nIt's involved in some process\nof degrading a molecule\nand creating another molecule, typically.\nSo ATP and cytochrome c\nis going to give you ATP.\nNow, that's a great thing,\nbut it creates a byproduct.\nIt breaks things down, such\nthat you get these ROSs,\nthese reactive oxygen species.\nAnd those reactive oxygen species,\nfor those of you that want to know,\nare involved in things\nlike redox signaling.\nAnd reactive oxygen\nspecies actually change\nwhich genes are made in a cell.\nSo the goal of any\ntreatment is to keep neurons\nor other cells youthful\nand functioning well,\nand to prevent or reverse aging,\nis going to be to increase ATP\nand to reduce reactive oxygen species,\nand in doing so, to disrupt\nsome of the normal pathways\nassociated with aging.\nThe Jeffery Lab approached these studies\nwith that understanding\nof how mitochondria\nand reactive oxygen species and ATP work.\nAnd what they did was exquisitely simple\nto the point of being elegant.\nAnd what they found was\nreally, really exciting.\nWhat they did is they had people,\nsubjects that were either\nyounger, so in their 20s,\nor 40 years old or older,\nview red light of about 670 nanometers.\n670 nanometers would\nappear red to you and me.\nThey, they had them do that, excuse me,\nat a distance that was\nsafe for their eyes,\nso at about a foot away.\nNow, a foot away from a\nvery intense red light\ncould actually be damaging to the eyes,\nso they had them do this\nat about a foot away\nfrom a red light that was\nof low enough intensity\nthat it did not damage the eyes.\nAnd they had them do that anywhere\nfrom two to three minutes per day.\nAnd in one study, they had them do that\nfor a long period of\ntime of about 12 weeks.\nAnd in the other study,\nthey had them do that just\nfor a couple of weeks.\nWhat's remarkable is that\nwhen you collapse the results\nacross these two studies,\nwhat they found is that when\nlooking at these subjects\nranging from 28 years old\nto about 72 years old,\nthe major findings were\nthat in individuals\n40 years old or older,\nso in the 40 to 72-year-old bracket,\nbut not in the subjects\nyounger than 40 years old,\nthey saw an improvement\nin visual function.\nThat improvement in visual function\nwas an improvement in visual acuity,\nmeaning the ability to\nresolve fine detail,\nand using a particular\nmeasure of visual function,\nwhich is called the Tritan exam.\nT-R-I-T-A-N, Tritan exam,\nwhich specifically addresses the function\nof the so-called short wavelength cones,\nthe ones that respond\nto green and blue light,\nthey saw a 22% improvement\nin visual acuity,\nwhich in the landscape of visual testing\nis an extremely exciting result.\nOkay, so I think in most studies\nof improvements of vision,\nyou'd be very excited to see\nan improvement of 5% or 10%.\nSo a 22% improvement in visual acuity,\neven though it's in\nthis very specific form\nof visual testing, this Tritan\nexam or this Tritan score,\nwell, that turns out\nto be very significant\nand translates to the real\nworld in an important way.\nIn particular, as we age,\nwe tend to lose certain\nneurons within our retina,\nbut we don't tend to lose cones.\nWe tend to lose rods.\nWe tend to lose other\ncells within the retina,\nincluding the cells that\nconnect the eye to the brain,\nthe so-called ganglion cells.\nCones, for whatever reason,\nare pretty resilient to age-related loss.\nHowever, because rods and cones both\nare not just among the most\nmetabolically active cells\nin your entire body,\nbut the most metabolically\nactive cells in your entire body\nthat's right, your rods and\ncones are the cells that demand,\nand that use the most energy\nof all the cells in your body,\nnot your skin cells,\nnot your spleen, not your stomach cells.\nEven if you talk a lot,\nnot the cells that are\nresponsible for moving your mouth.\nIt is the rods and cones\nof your neural retina\nthat are responsible for\nusing the most amount of ATP\nand energy in your entire body.\nAnd because of that,\nthose cells tend to accumulate a lot\nof reactive oxygen species as we age.\nRed light of the sort\nused in these studies\nwas able to reduce the amount\nof reactive oxygen species\nin the rods and cones and\nto rescue the function\nof this particular cone type,\nthe short wavelength and\nmedium wavelength cones,\nwhich if you think about the study,\nis a little bit surprising,\nbecause it was red light\nand near-infrared light,\nnot short wavelength light,\nthat was used in order to\ncreate this improvement\nin cellular function.\nBut if you step back a little bit further,\nit makes perfect sense because\nthere's nothing specific\nabout the red light in the sense\nthat it gets delivered only to red cones.\nThat red light and near-infrared\nlight is being absorbed\nby all the photoreceptors within the eye,\nthe rods and the blue cones\nand the green cones and the red cones.\nIt's just that the red cones\nabsorb that light best.\nSo the important takeaway here\nis that viewing red light\nand near-infrared light\nat a distance at which it is safe\nfor just a couple of minutes each day\nallowed a reversal of the\naging process of these neurons,\nwhich some people have\nheard me say before,\nand I'll just say it again,\nthe retina, including your photoreceptors,\nare not just connected to your brain.\nThey're not just near your brain.\nThey are actual central\nnervous system tissue.\nThey are the only two\npieces of your brain,\nmeaning your neuroretinas\nare the only two pieces\nof your brain that reside\noutside your skull,\nor at least outside the cranial vault.\nSo here we're seeing a\nreversal of the aging process\nin neurons by shining red\nlight on those neurons.\nNow, of course, the Jeffery Lab\nis primarily interested in vision,\nand humans are most dependent on vision\nas a sense to navigate\nthe world and survive.\nSo this is really wonderful.\nHere, we're looking at a therapy\nthat can reverse age-related vision loss,\nat least in some individuals.\nBut as you can imagine,\nthe study was also done on these cells\nbecause they reside outside the skull\nand you can shine light\ndirectly on them, right?\nI'm sure that there are\nmany people out there\nwho are interested in how\nthey can improve the function,\nsay, of the neurons in their\nbrain responsible for memory.\nAnd in a few minutes,\nI'll describe the non-invasive\napplications of light\nto try and restore the function\nof those cells as well.\nSo a little bit more about the\nstudies from the Jeffery Lab.\nOne of the things that they observed was\na reduction in so-called\ndrusen, D-R-U-S-E-N.\nDrusen are little fatty deposits,\nlittle cholesterol deposits,\nthat accumulate in the eye as we age.\nWe've all heard about cholesterol\nwithin our veins and arteries\nand how that can clog\nour veins and arteries\nand how, of course, clogging\nof veins and arteries\nis not a good thing.\nWell, our neural retina\nbeing so metabolically active\nrequires a lot of blood flow.\nIt's heavily vascularized,\nand drusen are a special\nform of cholesterol\nthat accumulate in the eye.\nAs it turns out, these red light\nand near-infrared light therapies\nexplored by the Jeffery Lab\nwere able to actually reduce or reverse\nsome of the accumulation of drusen.\nAnd so in addition to reducing\nreactive oxygen species,\nthe idea in mind now is that red light\nmay actually reduce cholesterol deposits\nand reactive oxygen species\nin order to improve neuronal function.\nSo what should you and\nI do with these results?\nOr should we do anything\nwith these results?\nWell, first of all, I want to emphasize\nthat even though these\nstudies are very exciting,\nthey are fairly recent.\nAnd so more data, as always, are needed.\nThere's some additional\nfeatures of these studies\nthat I think are also\nimportant to consider.\nFirst of all, the exposure to red light\nneeded to happen early in the day,\nat least within the first\nthree hours of waking.\nHow would one do that?\nWell, nowadays there are a number\nof different red light panels\nand different red light sources\nthat certainly fall within\nthe range of red light\nand near-infrared light\nthat one could use.\nI don't have any affiliation\nto any companies or products\nthat promote or make\nthose red light therapies.\nI do own a red light panel,\nso I confess I have started\nusing this protocol.\nI am older than 40 years old.\nI also have been experimenting\nwith these red light panels\nas a way of addressing other\nchanges in biological tissues,\nfor which I'm doing blood work, et cetera.\nAnd I'm going to talk about\nthat in a future episode,\nbut that, of course, is\nwhat I call anecdata.\nIt only relates to my experience.\nSo today, and certainly on all episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe emphasize peer-reviewed\nstudies almost exclusively,\ntalking about anecdata\nonly when highlighting it as anecdata.\nSo if you're somebody who wants\nto explore red light therapy,\nhere's what you need to do.\nYou need to make sure that\nthat red light source,\nwhatever source you happen to use,\nwhether or not you\npurchase it or make one...\nAnd in fact, these red light sources\nare very, very easy to make.\nYou could essentially\ntake a bright flashlight\nand cover it with a film or a filter\nthat would only allow\nparticular long wavelengths\nto pass through.\nThis would be very easy to look up online\nand figure out how to do this.\nYou could probably do this for,\nyou know, just a few dollars\nor you could purchase a red light unit\nif that was within your budget\nand something that you're interested in.\nYou want to make sure\nthat it's not so bright\nthat you're damaging your eye.\nA good rule of thumb is that something\nisn't painful to look at.\nAnd in fact, I should just emphasize\nthat any time you look\nat any light source,\nsunlight or otherwise, that's painful\nand makes you want to\nsquint or close your eyes,\nthat means it's too bright to look at\nwithout closing your eyes.\nOkay, that's sort of a duh,\nbut I would loathe to think\nthat anyone would harm themselves\nwith bright light in any way.\nI don't just say that to protect us.\nI say that to protect you, of course,\nbecause you are responsible\nfor your health.\nAnd again, retinal\nneurons do not regenerate.\nOnce they are gone and\ndead, they do not come back.\nThere's no technology to replace them\nat this current state in time.\nSo please don't damage your retinas.\nSo is a red light source safe to look at\nif it is not painful to look at?\nChances are it is.\nAnd yet I would still encourage you\nto talk to your optometrist\nor ophthalmologist\nbefore getting into any\nextensive protocols.\nBut if you are still determined\nto pursue the sorts of protocols\nthat are in the Jeffery studies,\ncertainly we'll provide\na link to those studies.\nAgain, it involved looking\nat these red light panels,\nblinking aloud for two\nminutes to three minutes\nevery morning for a period\nof two weeks or more.\nAnd if you're older than 40,\nthat could very well have an effect.\nIf you're longer, younger\nthan 40, excuse me,\nthat's unlikely to have an effect.\nAt least that was what was observed\nin these particular studies.\nThe lights were not flashing.\nIt was continuous illumination.\nAgain, you're allowed to blink.\nIt does not have to even\nbe direct illumination.\nIt can be somewhat indirect illumination,\nmuch as we described for\nthe use of UVB light before.\nThe wavelength of light is important.\nIt is red light and near-infrared light\nthat is going to be\neffective in this scenario.\nThe authors of this study\nemphasized that it was red light\nof 670 nanometers in wavelength\nand near-infrared light of\n790 nanometers in wavelength\nthat were effective\nand that those wavelengths\ncould be complimentary.\nThat's probably why, or\nmaybe it's just coincidental,\nbut it's a fortunate coincidence\nthat a lot of the commercially\navailable red light panels\nthat you'll find out there\ncombine both red light\nand near-infrared light.\nHowever, I want to emphasize\nthat most of the panels\nthat are commercially available\nare going to be too bright to\nsafely look at very close up.\nAnd in fact, that's why most\nof those red light panels\nare designed for illumination of the skin\nand oftentimes arrive in their packaging\nwith eye protectors that\nare actually designed\nto shield out all the red light.\nSo take the potential dangers\nof excessive illumination\nof the eyes with any\nwavelength of light seriously.\nBut if you're going to explore\n670 and 790 nanometer light\nfor sake of enhancing neuronal function,\nset it at a distance that's\ncomfortable to look at,\nand that doesn't force you to squint\nor doesn't make you feel\nuncomfortable physically,\nas if you need to turn away\nduring the period\nof that two to three-minute\nillumination each day.\nIn terms of turning away from light,\nI'll just briefly mention\nthat that is not an accident\nor a coincidence that\nyou have that response\nto very bright light.\nThere is a so-called\nphotic avoidance pathway\nthat involves cells within your retina,\nthese ganglion cells that communicate\nwith yet another brain station,\na certain area of your\nthalamus that communicate\nto areas of your brain that\nare associated with pain.\nSo literally that can trigger headache,\nand that can trigger the squint reflex.\nBiology is just beautiful in this way.\nToo much light is bad for us\nin that it can damage our eyes\nand other aspects of our body.\nSo if we look at a\nlight that's too bright,\nour eyes send a signal to the brain\nthat gives us a sort of a headache\nand a desire to squint and turn away.\nSo that can be a useful guide\nin terms of gauging how\nbright a light should be\nor at least how far away you\nshould be from a bright source\nin order to safely engage\nwith that light source.\nSo the studies I just\ndescribed, once again,\ninvolve the use of red\nlight early in the day\nwithin three hours of waking\nand are for the sake of\nimproving neuronal function.\nRed light has also been\nshown to be beneficial\nlate in the day and even\nin the middle of the night.\nAnd when I say middle of the night,\nI'm referring to studies that\nexplore the use of red light\nfor shift workers.\nI know that most people are not working\nin the middle of the night,\nat least I hope they're not,\nbut some of you may do\nthat from time to time.\nAll-nighters for studying,\nI confess I still pull\nall-nighters every once in a while\nto prepare things like\npodcasts and other deadlines.\nI really try not to, happens\nless and less as I get older,\nbecause I think I get more disciplined\nand/or less good at pulling all-nighters.\nBut I realize that many\npeople are doing shift work,\nor they have to work\ncertainly past 10:00 pm.\nOr maybe they're taking\ncare of young children\nin the middle of the night,\nand they have to be up.\nIn that case, red light can\nactually be very beneficial.\nAnd nowadays there are a\nlot of sources of red light\navailable just as red light bulbs.\nYou don't need a panel.\nSo what I'm basically saying\nis that it can be beneficial\nto use red lights at night.\nThe study I'd like to emphasize\nin this context is entitled,\nRed Light: A Novel\nNon-pharmacological Intervention\nto Promote Alertness in Shift Workers.\nIt's a beautiful study.\nThey explored the use of\ndifferent wavelengths of light,\nso blue light of 460 nanometers\nor red light or dim white light,\nof different brightnesses, et cetera,\nand looked at things like melatonin.\nHow much does light of a given color\nand intensity suppress melatonin?\nThey looked at cortisol, a stress hormone.\nThey looked at wakefulness,\nhow much or to what degree\ncould a given color of light\nincrease wakefulness at\ndifferent hours of the day?\nThe takeaway from this\nstudy is very clear.\nIf you need to be awake late\nat night for sake of shift work\nor studying or taking care\nof children, et cetera,\nred light is going to be your best choice\nbecause if the red light\nis sufficiently dim,\nit's not going to inhibit\nmelatonin production,\nand it's not going to\nincrease cortisol at night.\nCortisol should be high early in the day,\nor at least should be elevated relative\nto other times of day if you are healthy.\nA late shifted increase\nin cortisol, however,\n9:00 pm cortisol, 10:00 pm cortisol,\nis well known to be\nassociated with depression\nand other aspects of mental health,\nor I should say mental illness.\nSo if you do need to be awake\nat night or even all night,\nred light is going to be\nthe preferred light source.\nAnd in terms of how bright to make it,\nwell, as dim as you can,\nwhile still being able\nto perform the activities\nthat you need to perform.\nThat's going to be your best guide.\nI'll provide a link to this study as well.\nAgain, it's a really important study\nbecause it emphasized that\nthere are forms of light,\nred light, provided it's dim,\nthat can allow you to\nstimulate the alertness\nthat light landing on\nthe eyes can provide.\nSo it allows you to stay awake\nand to do whatever work\nthat you need to do.\nIt does not seem to alter\nmelatonin production,\nso that's good.\nIt does not seem to alter levels\nor timing of cortisol production.\nSo yet another case where\nred light used correctly\ncan be beneficial.\nUp until now, we've been talking\nabout the effects of shining\ndifferent wavelengths of light\non the skin or on our eyes\nand the downstream health\nconsequences of that illumination.\nHowever, one of the most important goals\nof science and medicine is to figure out\nhow to change the health of our brain.\nAnd of course, our brain is\ncontained within our skull,\nand therefore we can't just shine light\nonto the outside of our head\nand expect it to change the activity\nof neurons deep within the brain,\nunless those neurons are\nlinked up with our eyes\nor with our skin.\nAnd as it turns out, even\nthough there are a lot\nof brain areas that are\nconnected through neural circuits\nand hormone circuits through our eye,\nand believe it or not, also to our skin,\nmany brain areas are not.\nBrain areas such as the hippocampus,\nwhich is involved in learning and memory,\nbrain areas such as our neocortex,\nwell, some areas of our neocortex\nsuch as our visual cortex\nare indirectly linked to our eyes,\nso if we shine light in our eyes,\nwe can change the activity\nof neurons in our neocortex,\nbut there are other brain areas\nthat are not directly or\neven indirectly connected\nto our visual system,\nnot at least in any immediate way.\nSo that raises the question\nof how do you change the\nactivity of neurons in the brain?\nWell, there's pharmacology.\nYou can take pills, you can inject drugs\nthat will change the\npharmacology of neurons\nand the way they operate and fire.\nOf course, antidepressants\nare one such instance,\nopioid drugs are another.\nThere's a huge array of\npsychoactive compounds,\nmeaning compounds that\nwill change the levels\nof chemicals in your brain.\nSome of those work,\nmany of them also carry side effects.\nIt's all rather indirect,\nmeaning you have lots of different cells\nin different areas of your brain\nthat utilize the same chemicals.\nSo a drug, for instance,\nto increase serotonin\nfor sake of improving depression\nwill also often have the effect\nof reducing certain neurons\noutput of serotonin in the hippocampus\nand cause changes in\nappetite or changes in libido\nand so on and so forth.\nYou could imagine using\nelectrical stimulation,\nputting wires into the brain\nand stimulating specific brain areas\nin order to activate the\nneurons in those brain areas.\nAnd certainly that works and\nhas been done experimentally\nand is done during\nneurosurgery exams, et cetera,\nbut involves removing a piece of skull.\nSo that's not very practical.\nIn principle, light\nwould be a wonderful way\nto modulate the activity of\nneurons deep within the brain.\nBut again, the skull is in the way.\nRecent studies, however,\nhave figured out ways\nthat light can be delivered to the eyes\nto change global patterns\nof firing in the brain\nin ways that can be\nbeneficial to the brain.\nAnd the work that I'm referring to now\nis mainly the work of Li-Huei Tsai at MIT,\nMassachusetts Institute of\nTechnology, and her colleagues.\nAnd what they've discovered\nthat there's a particular\npattern of brain activity\ncalled gamma activity.\nGamma activity is one so-called wavelength\nof electrical activity in the brain,\nso not wavelengths of light,\nbut wavelengths of electrical\nactivity in the brain\nthat can be restorative\nfor certain aspects\nof learning and memory\nand can actually help create\nmolecular changes in neurons\nthat lead to clearance of debris\nand even reductions in\nage-related cognitive decline.\nSo the way to think about brain\nwaves and brain oscillations\nis that neurons are electrically active,\nthat involves chemicals, et cetera.\nAnd they can be active in\nvery slow, big waveforms.\nSo you can think of, you\nknow, Delta waves, meaning,\nso you can imagine a wave\nof electrical activity\nthat comes along very infrequently.\nSo a given neuron fires,\nand then some period of time later fires,\nand then some period of\ntime even later fires.\nOr you can imagine that that\nsame cell is very active,\nfires, fires, fires, fires, fires.\nYou can imagine if it's firing very often,\nit's going to be short wavelength, right?\nShorter gaps between firing.\nOr if it's firing very seldom,\nyou're going to think about that\nas longer wavelength firing.\nTurns out that gamma waves\nare one pattern of firing\nthat lead to downstream\nmetabolic functions\nand biological functions that\nend up clearing away debris\nthat's associated with aging in cells\nand that also lead to molecular changes\nthat enhance the kind of\nyouthfulness of neurons,\nso to speak.\nHow do we induce gamma\noscillations within the brain?\nWell, what Li-Huei Tsai and colleagues\nhave beautifully shown\nis that by delivering certain\npatterns of light flicker,\nso lights going on and off\nat a particular frequency,\nthe brain as a whole starts to entrain,\nmeaning it matches to\nthose particular patterns\nof light flicker,\neven though many of the\nbrain areas that do this\nare not directly within the\nvisual system or visual pathway.\nSo the studies that I'm\nreferring to are several,\nbut the one that I'd like\nto highlight is entitled,\nGamma Entrainment Binds\nHigher-Order Brain Regions\nand Offers Neuroprotection.\nWhat they essentially did\nwas to expose subjects to 40 hertz,\nwhich is a particular\nfrequency of illumination,\nto the eyes.\nSo it's light goes on, light goes off,\nlight goes on, light goes off\nat a frequency of 40 hertz.\nAnd when they did that and\nthey recorded the activity\nof neurons within the brain,\nnot just within the\nvisual areas of the brain,\nbut within other areas as well,\nthey observed increased\ngamma oscillations,\nmeaning that the electrical\nactivity of the brain at large\nstarted to match to the patterns of light\nthat were delivered to the eyes.\nThis is really exciting and very unique\nfrom the different types of phototherapies\nthat we've been talking\nabout up until now.\nAll the patterns of phototherapy\nthat we've been talking about up until now\ninvolved constant illumination\nwith a given wavelength.\nHere, it is wavelength generating\npatterns of illumination,\nlight on, light off, light on, light off,\nat a particular frequency.\nSo what they found, for instance,\nusing this pattern of stimulation,\nand by the way, the\nstimulation was called genus,\ngamma entrainment using\nsensory stimulation,\nso G-E-N-U-S,\ngamma entrainment using\nsensory stimulation,\nhad a number of really\ninteresting effects.\nFirst of all, it reduced\nso-called amyloid plaques\nand phosphorylated tau.\nAmyloid plaques and phosphorylated tau\nare associated with Alzheimer's\nand normal age related cognitive decline.\nSo this is incredible, right?\nA pattern of flashing\nlight delivered to the eyes\ncreates a pattern of neuronal firing,\nnot just in the visual areas of the brain,\nbut in other areas of the brain as well,\nthat in turn trigger molecular pathways\nthat reduce some of the markers\nand the cause age-related\ncognitive decline in Alzheimer's.\nAnd in parallel to that,\nthey observed an upregulation\nof some of the biological pathways\nthat lead to enhancement\nof neuronal function,\nmaintenance of synapses,\nwhich are the connections between neurons,\nand so on, and so on.\nThey have discovered and\nlist out a huge number\nof these biological effects,\nboth the reduction in\nbad things, so to speak,\nand the improvement in\ngood biological pathways.\nAnd I find these studies so exciting\nbecause, first of all,\nthey're non-invasive, right?\nThere's no drilling through the skull.\nThey are very tractable\nin the experimental sense,\nmeaning that you can imagine\nthat if 40 hertz stimulation turns out\nto be the very best stimulation protocol\nto induce these gamma\noscillations, well, great,\nbut because it's non-invasive,\nit's fairly easy to explore\n50 hertz stimulation,\n100 hertz stimulation,\n20 hertz stimulation,\nand to do that with different\nwavelengths of light.\nAnd so that's what's happening now.\nThe Tsai lab and other\nlabs are really starting\nto explore the full range of variables\nthat can impact oscillations\nwithin the brain\nand their downstream consequences.\nSo again, this is phototherapy,\nbut phototherapy of a very different sort\nthat we've been talking\nabout up until now.\nIt's phototherapy designed\nto trigger activation\nof biological pathways far\naway from the very tissue\nthat's being illuminated.\nAnd it calls to mind the\nsame sorts of mechanisms\nthat we were talking about earlier,\nwhere illumination of\nthe skin with UVB light\nis setting off an enormous\nnumber of different cascades\nin different organs and tissues,\nincluding the spleen, the\ntestes, the ovaries, and so on.\nSo again, light has\nthese powerful effects,\nboth locally on the cells that\nthe light is delivered to,\nbut also systemically\nin terms of the cells\nthat are changing their\nelectrical and chemical outputs,\nare modifying lots and lots\nof biological programs.\nIs there an actionable tool\nrelated to these studies yet?\nWell, that sort of depends\non how adventurous you are.\nRight now, these studies\nare being explored\nin the context of clinical trials,\nin people with Alzheimer's, dementia,\nand other forms of neurodegeneration.\nIs it dangerous to look at\na 40-hertz flickering light?\nWell, in general, the\nanswer is going to be no.\nHowever, if you're prone\nto epilepsy, for instance,\nstaring at a flickering light\nof a given continuous frequency\ncan induce seizure, right?\nThat might surprise some of you,\nbut it shouldn't, because\nas this study illustrates\nand as anyone who's ever been out at night\nto a club or something illustrates,\nwhen you look at a strobe\nlight, for instance,\nyour whole world of\nvisual perception changes,\nbut actually, the rhythm at\nwhich you perceive music,\nat which you perceive conversation,\nat which you perceive\nthe movement of your body\nactually changes according to the patterns\nof visual flicker,\nin most cases, strobe,\nif we're using the sort\nof club dancing example.\nYour brain is in training\nto its outside environment.\nSo given the power of flickering lights\nto entrain brain rhythms,\nI think at this stage, it's\nprobably too preliminary\nto really suggest a specific protocol,\nbut I would definitely keep an eye out\nfor these sorts of studies.\nThey are coming out all the time.\nAnd I think in a very short period,\nwe are going to see specific protocols\nthat one could use even at home,\nand of course, these are\nnon-invasive protocols,\nin order to place the brain\ninto a particular state,\nnot just for sake of\noffsetting neurodegeneration,\nbut also for enhancing focus,\nfor enhancing the transition into sleep,\nand other brain states as well.\nToday, I covered what I would\nsay is a lot of information.\nMy goal was to give you an understanding\nof how light can be used\nto change the activities\nof cells, organelles within\nthose cells, entire organs,\nand how that can happen\nlocally and systemically.\nWe talked about the power of\nlight to impact our biology\nat the endocrine level, neuronal level,\nimmune level, mood, et cetera,\nthrough both illumination\nof the eyes and the skin\nand other tissues as well.\nI realize that even though\nthis was a lot of information,\nthere are many aspects of\nphototherapy that I did not cover.\nI know there's a lot of\ninterest nowadays, for instance,\nin the use of red light and\nother wavelength light therapies\nfor ovarian health and testicular health.\nIn fact, I get a lot of questions such as,\ncan red light be used to\nimprove testosterone output?\nAnd if so, is that best accomplished\nby shining red light on the skin\nor directly on the\ngonads, on the testicles?\nI'm going to cover those\ndata at a future time.\nRight now, the studies that\nhave been done in rodents,\nI don't think are easily\nenough translated to humans.\nAnd the studies that are\nhappening in humans now\nare exciting in the sense that\nthey hold a lot of potential,\nbut the data aren't clear yet.\nHowever, the data using UVB\non the skin of men and women\nin order to increase hormone,\nin particular testosterone\nand estrogen output,\nthose data, I think, are very exciting\nand very actionable when we\ntalked about those earlier.\nSo if you want more information\non how phototherapy can be used,\ncertainly we will do another\nepisode on phototherapy\nin these other contexts.\nIf you're learning
