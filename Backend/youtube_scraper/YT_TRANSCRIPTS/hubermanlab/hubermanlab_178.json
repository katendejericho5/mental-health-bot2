    "video_title": "Dr. Kyle Gillett: How to Optimize Your Hormones for Health & Vitality",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[lively music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman.\nAnd I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Kyle Gillett.\nDr. Gillett is dual\nboard-certified in family medicine\nand obesity medicine and practices out\nof a clinic in Kansas\nand via telemedicine.\nHe provides full-spectrum medicine,\nincluding hormone health,\npreventative medicine, obstetrics,\nwhich is the branch of\nmedicine and surgery concerned\nwith childbirth and the care\nof women giving birth and pediatrics.\nI first learned about Dr.\nGillett from a podcast\nof all things and was immediately struck\nby the breadth and depth of his knowledge\non all things hormones\nand hormone optimization.\nAs you'll see very soon today,\nDr. Gillett can teach you how\nto optimize your hormones\nusing behavioral tools,\nnutrition, exercise-based tools,\nsupplementation, and hormone therapies\nif those are appropriate for you.\nThere are many professionals out there\nincluding many medical doctors of course,\ntalking about hormone health.\nWhat really sets Dr.\nGillett apart from the pack\nis his ability to understand\nhow the different factors\nthat I described before, nutrition,\nsupplementation, exercise,\nand hormone therapies,\nhow those interact with\none another and the safest\nand most rational ways\nto approach hormone optimization.\nDuring today's episode,\nyou will learn how to\noptimize your hormones,\nnot just testosterone and estrogen,\nbut also prolactin and\nother hormone pathways\nthat impact your mood, mental\nhealth and physical health.\nDr. Gillett is also an avid\neducator about hormones\nin other aspects of health.\nHe does this on zero cost\nto consumer platforms,\nsuch as Instagram and other social media.\nOn Instagram, he is kylegillettmd,\nthat's K-Y-L-E-G-I-L-L-E-T-T,\nno E at the end, MD.\nSo kylegilletmd on Instagram.\nAnd he is Gillett Health\non all other platforms,\nincluding LinkedIn, Twitter,\nYouTube, TikTok, and Facebook.\nIf you go to his Instagram\nor his other social media,\nyou will learn a lot about hormone health,\nabout the latest science impacting obesity\nand metabolic health.\nHe is a wealth of knowledge.\nAnd again, he's providing\nall that information\nat zero cost to you, the consumer.\nWhat you are soon to hear\nis a conversation between me\nand Dr. Gillett about all things hormones\nand hormone health and\nhormone optimization.\nWe dive deep into mechanisms,\nbut we are clear to\nestablish what each word\nor set of concepts mean.\nSo if you have no background\nin biology or even if you do,\nI'm sure that you'll\ncome away with a wealth\nof valuable knowledge.\nWe also talk about specific\nprotocols related again\nto lifestyle factors,\nnutrition, supplementation,\nand where appropriate,\nhormone replacement therapy.\nI know there's a lot of\ninterest about these topics.\nDr. Gillett is very thorough\nabout addressing both male\nand female issues and\naddressing hormone health\nfor people at all stages of life.\nI'm sure that you'll come\naway from this episode\nwith the same impression that I did,\nwhich is that Dr. Gillett\nis an extraordinarily clear communicator\nand that he has tremendous\ncompassion for his patients,\nand that he has a deep love\nof understanding biology\nand medicine in ways that can benefit you.\nI'm pleased to announce that\nI'm hosting two live events\nin May, 2022.\nThe first live event will take place\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second live event will take place\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a\nlecture series entitled,\n\"The Brain Body Contract\"\nduring which I will talk about science\nand science-based tools.\nMany of which overlap\nwith the topics covered\non the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut most of which will not and\nwill be completely new topics\nand tools never discussed publicly before.\nBoth live events will also include\na question and answer\nperiod during which you\nthe audience can ask me questions\ndirectly about any aspect\nof science or science-based tools\nand I will attempt to answer them.\nTickets for the two events, again,\nSeattle on May 17th and\nPortland on May 18th,\nare both available at\nhubermanlab.com/tour.\nBefore we begin with today's episode,\nI want to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Thesis.\nThesis makes nootropics.\nIn fact they make custom nootropics.\nNow what is a nootropic?\nTechnically nootropics means smart drug.\nFrankly, I'm not a big fan\nof the word nootropics,\nbecause what is smart?\nI mean, there's creativity, there's focus,\nthere's task switching,\ndifferent aspects of our brain and body\nengage different aspects of cognition,\nmany of which we can call smart.\nThere's emotional intelligence,\nthere's analytic intelligence,\nthere's logic, there's creativity.\nThesis understands this\nand has designed custom\nnootropics designed\nto bring your body and brain\ninto the specific state that you want.\nSo for instance,\nthey have specific\nnootropics for creativity,\nother nootropics for focus,\nother nootropics for motivation,\nand so on, and so forth.\nIn addition to that,\neach nootropics is\ncustom designed for you.\nThey use only the highest\nquality ingredients,\nthings like alpha-GPC\nand phosphatidylserine,\nwhich I've talked about\non this podcast before.\nThey also use ingredients\nlike ginkgo biloba,\nwhich many people use,\nlike and benefit from.\nHowever, there are also people like me\nwho can't take ginkgo biloba,\nbecause it gives me terrible headaches.\nI learned that a long time ago.\nAnd so I simply can't take any nootropic\nor any supplement for that matter\nthat includes ginkgo biloba.\nI'm sure I'm not alone in the fact\nthat some ingredients work\nfor me and others do not.\nThesis has solved this problem\nof individual variation\nby creating a brief quiz.\nSo if you go online to\ntakethesis.com/huberman\nand take a three-minute quiz,\nand then Thesis will send you\nto four different formulas\nthat match your specific preferences.\nAgain, that's takethesis.com/huberman.\nAnd if you use the code HUBERMAN,\nyou'll get 10% off your first\nbox of custom nootropics.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand longterm health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThere are a lot of blood\nand DNA tests out there,\nbut a major issue with many of them\nis that you get numbers back\nabout levels of hormones,\nmetabolic factors, lipids, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker has solved that problem\nby creating a personalized dashboard.\nSo you take your blood\nand/or your DNA test,\nyou get the results back,\nand where certain values\nmight be too high or too low\nfor your preference,\nyou can click on that and it\nwill direct you immediately\nto lifestyle factors, nutrition,\nsupplementation, et cetera,\nthat can help you bring those numbers back\ninto the ranges that are ideal for you.\nSo it not only gives you information about\nwhere your health stands,\nit gives you directives as to\nhow to improve your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\ngo to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans,\nthat's

lifetime\nstudying the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that your visual system\nis incredibly sophisticated.\nIt allows you to do things like move\nfrom a shady area outside\nto a sunny area outside\nand to adjust your visual system,\nso you don't even notice that transition.\nA lot of sunglasses and\neyeglasses are not designed\nwith those sorts of biological\ntransitions in mind.\nROKA sunglasses and\neyeglasses are different.\nEvery one of their glasses\nis designed with the biology\nof the visual system in mind.\nFirst of all, they're\nincredibly lightweight,\nso you don't even notice\nthat they're on your face.\nSecond of all,\nthey were designed to be\nworn during activities\nlike running and cycling, et cetera,\nand they won't slip off your\nface even if you get sweaty.\nAnd they have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo even though they\nwere originally designed\nas active eyewear, they look great.\nSo you can wear them out to dinner,\nto school, at work, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nsunglasses or eyeglasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com\nand enter the code HUBERMAN to\nsave 20% on your first order.\nAgain that's ROKA,

Well, I'm super excited to talk to you,\nbecause I found out about you\non a podcast and\nit immediately became clear\nthat you are an encyclopedia\nof knowledge about hormone health for men\nand for women across the lifespan.\nSo I have many, many questions,\nbut before we dive into those questions,\nI'd love to just get a\nlittle bit of your background\nin terms of your medical training\nand what your particular orientation is\ntoward treating your patients.\nAnd how do you think\nabout this whole landscape\nthat we call hormone health?\nWhat is a hormone?\nHow do you envision people\nmanaging their hormones?\nIf you could just kind of fill in\na few of those blanks for us,\nI think a lot of people\nwould appreciate it.\n- Absolutely, so I'm dual board-certified\nin family medicine and obesity medicine.\nI've kind of tailored my\ntraining in order to provide\nwhat I call a balanced\napproach to total health,\nwhich includes body, mind, and soul.\nI recently saw a podcast\nwith Joe Rogan and Mr. Beast.\nAnd Joe asks Mr. Beast,\n\"How do you become such\nan amazing YouTuber\nand have all these great clickbait videos,\nand how did you become good at it?\"\nAnd it turns out he just became obsessed\nwhen he was a teenager.\nAnd that's essentially\nhow I've tailored my education as well.\nI've become obsessed with\noptimal human performance,\ntheir body, their mind,\nand even their spirit.\nSo I attended med school at\nthe University of Kansas,\nwhich is one of the few med schools\nthat still emphasizes full-spectrum care.\nThey emphasize exercise is medicine.\nThey emphasize food is medicine,\nof which I was active in both\nof those interest groups.\nIn residency, I was active in a lot\nof mindfulness curriculum.\nAnd then also things like Walk with a Doc\nwhere you emphasize preventative medicine.\nThat's something that we've\nkind of got away from.\nAnd that niche led me to hormone health.\nIt didn't really start as hormone health,\nbut it's a very important\ncomponent of health in general\nthat many people don't emphasize.\n- Great, well, this idea\nof preventative medicine,\nI think, is starting to really take hold\nin the general population,\nespecially given the events\nof the last few years,\npeople realize that they are\nshowing up to health challenges\nat a bunch of different levels.\nAnd with some people feeling very robust,\nother people feeling back on their heels.\nWhen someone comes to you as a patient,\nwhat are some of the\nfirst things that you want\nto know about them?\nI mean, obviously you want\nto know their blood pressure.\nYou want to know something\nabout their mental health\nand family history.\nBut in terms of hormone health,\nwhat are the sorts of probe\nquestions that you ask\nand what are you looking for?\nAnd I ask this because I'd\nlike people to be able to ask\nsome of these very same\nquestions for themselves.\n- Yeah, so when you do a physical exam\nand a history, you have\na lot of different parts.\nYou have your history of present illness\nif they have a complaint,\nmaybe the patient\ndoesn't have a complaint.\nIn that case, things\nlike their social history\nand their family history\nare extremely important,\nbecause that gives you\nan insight into their genetics\nand an insight into their hormone health.\nSo patients will tell\nme, oh, I'm doin' okay,\nbut it helps to ask them,\nwell, how are you now?\nLet's say the patient is 50.\nHow are you now versus when you were 20,\nand what has changed?\nSo I've gotten the question the lot,\nhow do you get your doctor\nto order a better lab workup\nor to even include your basic hormones?\nAnd there's no magic answer to that,\nbut what really helps is you tell them,\nmy energy is not as good as it used to be.\nMy focus is not as good as it used to be.\nMy athletic performance is\nnot as good as it used to be.\nSo you don't have to have a pathology\nin order for a lab to be indicated.\nYou just have that pertinent symptom.\n- I think that's going\nto be really helpful,\nbecause for many people,\nthe idea of getting a blood test to look\nat their hormones just seems like such\nan enormous hurdle to get over,\nand many doctors won't prescribe them.\nAnd would you say that it's,\nusing the approach you just described,\nthat it's equally\neffective for men and women\nor do you find that, for\none reason or another,\nthat men and women have\ndifferent challenges\nand advantages in trying\nto access their deeper hormone data?\n- Yeah. It's slightly different.\nWith women, there's a\nlot more objective data.\nSo if they're having\nmenstrual irregularities or\nif they're not havin' a period,\nif they're having too heavy of periods,\nthen those are things that they talk about\nvery frequently with their doctor.\nMen are more hesitant.\nSo men really want to know\nwhat their testosterone is,\nbut at the same time,\nthey really don't want\nto tell their doctor\nhow their libido is or\nhow their energy is,\nbecause it's almost like\nthey feel less masculine\nor they feel less like\na guy when they say that\neven if they're just talking\nto their doctor about it.\n- Yeah, I think that that\nraises a really important point,\nwhich is that the whole\ndiscussion around hormone health\nis a bit of a barbed wire topic,\nbecause in many ways when\nwe hear the word hormone,\nwe think testosterone and estrogen,\nwe think notions of\nmasculinity and femininity.\nAnd of course testosterone\nand estrogen are present\nin all sexes, right?\nAll chromosomal backgrounds.\nAnd just varying degrees in ratios.\nBut it also raises all these\nissues about sexual health that\nit's kind of interesting,\n'cause I'm surrounded by medical doctors\nin my lab at Stanford.\nAnd the more physicians\nthat I surround myself with,\nthe more open is the\ndiscussion around sexual health\nand reproductive health.\nBut in the general population,\nI think some of these topics\nare a little bit taboo\nor against kind of barbed wire.\nAnd so I think that people are seeking\na lot of this information on YouTube\nand through communities that may\nor may not be very educated\nabout the actual biology.\nSo along those lines,\nwe could probably assume\nthat hormones are changing\nacross the lifespan, right?\nCertainly from childhood\nand puberty and onward.\nIf you would,\nI'd love to just kind\nof take a snapshot of\nwhat you think everybody\nshould be thinking about\nor doing to optimize their hormone health,\nmale or female, in,\nlet's say in their 20s.\nAnd then maybe we could migrate\nthat to their 30s and 40s.\nBut before that,\ncould you just tell us what\neveryone should be doing\nfor their hormone health\nfrom puberty onward?\n- Yeah, the law of\ndiminishing returns applies.\nSo doing a little amount\nof what I call lifestyle interventions\nover a long period of time is\ngoing to be far more helpful\nor efficacious than doing a\nlot and then doing nothing\nor doing a lot and then doing nothing.\nSo I talk about the big six pillars.\nThe two strongest ones are\nlikely diet and exercise.\nFor hormone health,\nspecifically resistance training\nis particularly helpful.\nFor diet, caloric restriction\ncan be particularly helpful,\nespecially with the epidemic\nof metabolic syndrome\nthat is continuing to\non go in this country\nand in developed countries in general.\nSo those are the two most powerful.\nSo number one and number\ntwo are diet and exercise.\nFor the last four, I have a\nlittle bit of alliteration.\nSo there's stress and stress optimization.\nThat has to do with cortisol,\nthat has to do with your mental health,\nthat has to do with societal health,\nand collective health\nof your family as well.\nWhen you're a member of a family\nor even a very close friend\ntrying to achieve optimal health\ntogether is very important.\nIt's the same thing\nwith nicotine cessation.\nIt's the same thing with\nhormone optimization.\nIf you do it as a household\nunit, it's far more helpful.\nSo after stress, you\nhave sleep optimization.\nSleep is extremely important,\nespecially for mitochondrial\nhealth as well.\nAnd then you have sunlight,\nwhich encompasses\nanything that's outdoors.\nSo you move more, you have cold exposure,\nyou have heat exposure, that's sunlight.\nAnd then last one is spirit.\nSo that's kind of the\nbody, mind, and soul.\nIf you have all the other five in,\nthey're dialed in completely,\nbut you don't have your spiritual health,\nwhatever you believe,\nthen that's going to\nprofoundly impact your body\nand your mind as well.\n- Yeah, and we're definitely\ngoing to touch into this notion\nof spiritual health,\nbecause I think for some people\nthat might draw connotations\nof certain things that may\nor may not be accurate,\nbut I know a number of\nacademic laboratories\nthat are focused on this and a number of,\nnot just functional medicine clinics,\nbut research clinics and\nhospitals throughout the country\nthat are achieving some\nreally interesting data,\nnot just in people that are quite sick,\nbut in healthy people who are trying\nto further optimize health.\nSo we will definitely touch back to that.\nIf you would be so kind\nas to maybe give us\na little bit more detail about\nsome of these other areas.\nSo when people hear diet,\nI immediately think, okay,\nnow we get into\nthe combat around vegan,\nplant-based, carnivore, et cetera.\nBut I think that my general view of this\nis that most people\nshould probably be eating\nas few highly processed foods,\nhighly palatable foods as possible,\nwhich doesn't mean eating foods\nthat don't taste good, of course.\nBut what other sorts of\nthings do do you recommend\nin the realm of diet?\nAnd then I also want to know\nabout caloric restriction,\nbecause my understanding\nis that a caloric surplus\ncan actually support certain\nhormones like testosterone.\nSo how does one combine\ncaloric restriction\nand still optimize hormones?\nBut what would you say\nis a really terrific way\nto think about an approached diet?\n- Yeah. Diet should be an\nindividualized approach.\nSo if you have a car,\neach car is made different and requires\na different sort of fuel,\nwhether it's a race car,\nwhether it's a diesel truck,\nthey have different fuels\nfor different performance outcomes.\nSo if you're trying to tow something\nor you're trying to go fast.\nSo it's the same way with athletes.\nIt's pretty well studied.\nThe more intra-workout carbs\nultra long distance athletes take,\nin general, they do better.\nI think they've studied this\nin cyclists quite often.\nIt also depends on your genetics.\nSo you can have a genetic polymorphism\nand you metabolize carbs and sugar better,\neven when they're unopposed by fiber.\n- How does one determine whether\nor not they have such a polymorphism?\nI mean, I'm an omnivore,\nso I do eat some high quality meats,\nnot in huge quantities,\nbut I also eat vegetables\nand starches, I feel fine.\nI've never done an elimination diet.\nI think I did a very low carb diet once\nand all it gave me was a lot\nof psoriasis and poor sleep,\nso I backed off.\nI probably didn't do it correctly,\nbut I know a lot of\npeople that do quite well\non a very low carb or zero carb diet.\n- Yeah, particularly those\nwho are at risk of cancer,\nbecause you have less glucose\nthat can be easily uptaken into cells.\nAnd then also people\nwith autoimmune diseases.\n- They tend to do well on auto-\n- On lower carb diets, yeah.\nBut yeah, as far as the how do you know,\nbasically you can use your biofeedback,\nhow you're feeling, to guess\nwhat you tolerate well,\nor you can just get genetic testing,\nwhich can be fairly\nexpensive, but most of all,\nit requires a physician\nor someone who knows how\nto interpret the test accurately.\n- And if someone had the means or\nwould you say that getting\nregular blood testing\nis a good idea?\nAnd if so, what is regular blood testing?\nIs it every three months?\nIs it every six months?\nOf course the backdrop\nof life is changing too,\nstress levels, et cetera.\n- Yeah, every three to six\nmonths for preventative purposes,\nat times you need blood tests\nat faster frequencies than that.\nAnd then you should also get a blood test\nwhen you're fasting and\nwhen you're not fasting.\nSo if you're looking\nfor damage to the beach,\nyou don't just look at low tide,\nyou look at high tide and\nyou see what's happening\nat high tide as well.\n- I think that's a great way to put it.\nAnd in terms of general\nrecommendations around exercise,\nI mean, I'm of the mind,\nbased on the data that I've seen,\nthat almost everybody should,\nor everybody should be getting\n150 to 180 minutes minimum\nof Zone 2 cardio per week\nthat kind of could continue\nwhile having a conversation,\nbut if one were to exert any more effort,\nit would have a hard time\ngetting the words out.\nAt least that, right?\nFor cardiovascular health\nand general brain health\nand musculoskeletal health\nplus resistance exercise.\nIs that more or less the\ncontour of what you recommend?\n- Yeah, that's more or less the contour.\nThe more you're doing your\nZone 2 cardiovascular exercise,\nthe slightly less\nimportant a long duration\nof caloric restriction is.\n- Interesting, and that brings\nus to caloric restriction.\nSo it's very clear that\ncaloric restriction\ncan allow one to lose weight, right?\nThis is the classic CICO, C-I-C-O,\ncalories in calories out.\nWe are not disputing\ncalories in calories out.\nBut somehow that always\nhas to be stated 50 times\nin any forum because of whatever follows,\npeople I think will anchor to,\nand assume that we don't mean that,\nbut I know you and I both agree\non calories in calories out\nas a fundamental law of thermodynamics.\nBut it's clear to me that\nbased on what I've read\nthat when one is in a\nslight caloric surplus\nthat hormones like\ntestosterone can be optimized,\nbut is that true for\nsomebody who's showing up\nwith excessive body fat?\nHow does this all work?\nBecause body fat is manufacturing enzymes\nthat convert testosterone to estrogen.\nSo in other words,\nhow does someone know if they\nshould use caloric restriction\nor avoid caloric restriction?\n- Yeah, here's how to parse that out.\nSo before I delve into the\ndetails a bit more, I should say,\nas a board-certified\nobesity medicine physician,\nobviously the laws of\nthermodynamics apply.\nAnd then in addition to that,\nthere is nothing special\nabout intermittent fasting\nor caloric restriction\nor exercise when it pertains\nto losing body weight in general.\nWhen you do lose weight,\nabout 33% of that is lean body mass.\nAnd about 10% of fat cells,\nadipose cells are actually\nlean body mass as well,\nbecause it has proteins and water\nand things like that in it too so\nthe reason for exercise\nand the reason for caloric\nrestriction in general,\nincluding intermittent\nfasting, is health reasons.\nThat's how you increase your health span.\nIt's not necessarily\ngoing to make the weight\non a scale change, but that\ndoesn't matter as much.\nIt's been fairly well studied\nin both mice and humans.\nIt's much easier to study in mice.\nSo that's a precursor to\nour six types of people,\nthe ones that care about mice studies\nand the ones that care\nabout human studies.\nBut if you correctly restrict mice by 40%,\nthan they can\nhave improved testosterone parameters,\nbut only if they're obese to start.\nAnd it appears to be that\nsame way in humans as well.\nSo the easy way to think about it is\nif you're obese or you\nhave metabolic syndrome,\ncaloric restriction will\nimprove your testosterone.\nThere has been a study and they\ntalk about all these studies\nin a systematic review from\nthe Mayo Clinic Proceedings\nin March of last year.\nAnd they note that there is a study\nin young, healthy men and\nthey calorically restrict them\nand their testosterone does decrease.\nSo if you're young and healthy\nand you don't have metabolic syndrome,\nthen caloric restriction\nwill likely decrease your testosterone.\n- That clarifies a lot for me.\nAnd I believe it will clarify a lot\nfor other people as well.\nAnd I'm delighted that you\npointed out this distinction\nabout intermittent fasting\nnot being the only way\nto achieve caloric restriction.\nThere are a number of young, healthy,\nor older, healthy people I know\nwho like using intermittent fasting,\neven if they're not trying to lose weight,\nfor a couple of reasons.\nSome believe that it\nmight extend lifespan.\nI think that's still a\nbit of an open question.\nIt's a bit of a hard experiment to do,\nbecause the control group is,\nno one wants in the\ncontrol group as I say.\n- It does in mice.\n- Right. Exactly.\n- Captive audience.\n- Exactly, and the other\nfeature of it that's\na little bit tricky is that many people\nlike intermittent fasting\nbecause of the mental effects,\nthe clarity of mind that\nthey feel during fasting,\nthe increased pleasure in\neating when they finally do eat\nand here I'm referring\nto intermittent fasting\nof the sort where eating\nwindows are anywhere\nfrom 8 to 12 hours a day.\nNot extended fasts of 24 hours or more.\nSo the question therefore is,\nfor the healthy lean enough person, right?\nNon-obese person, is\nintermittent fasting a bad idea\nin terms of hormone health?\nIs oscillating between this period\nof kind of feast and famine\nwithin a 24 hours a problem\nif one is getting sufficient\ncalories to maintain weight?\n- Yeah, so if they're in\na caloric maintenance,\nthen it's not going to be,\nit's not going to be deleterious.\nIt's not going to be bad\nfor their hormone health.\nThere's a couple different\nhormones that we can talk about.\nWe can talk out testosterone.\nWe can talk about DHEA, which\nusually go hand in hand.\nAnd then we can also talk\nabout growth hormone,\nwhich is not a steroid hormone,\nbut it's a peptide hormone.\nSo it's a chain of proteins,\namino acids that are put\ntogether instead of a sterile,\nthink of sterile hormones\nas coming from cholesterol.\nSo intermittent fasting,\nyou do get a little spike in\ngrowth hormone after you eat,\nbut you also get a huge\nspike in growth hormone,\na more significant, less\nnegligible spike overnight.\nAnd that is improved if you\nare intermittent fasting.\nSo it's probably going to\nhelp your growth hormone\nand subsequently IGF-1 levels,\nwhich will help more\nin the older age groups\nthan younger age groups.\n- And I like to eat dinner.\nSo for me, that means sometime\naround six or seven o'clock,\nsometimes eight o'clock.\nI confess last night,\n'cause I was working late,\nI ate pretty big,\nit was basically my only meal\nof the day, at 10 o'clock.\nThat's a rare thing for me.\nCan I still achieve a high\ndegree of growth hormone output\nif, let's say I avoid food\nin the two to three hours\nbefore going to sleep?\nOr does one have to be very\ndeep into a fast in order\nto achieve the increase in growth hormone?\n- There's still pretty\ngood growth hormone output\neven if you eat two or three\nhours before you sleep.\nIt's just the law of diminishing\nreturns, the longer you go,\nyou get slightly more and slightly more.\n- Right, and I know a\nnumber of people think\nof growth hormone in the context\nof the exogenous growth\nhormone and the fact\nthat that can, in some cases,\nbe associated with cancers.\nI've been asked many times before,\ncan the increase in growth\nhormone from things like saunas\nor intermittent fasting cause\nlevels of growth hormone\nthat are so high that they cause cancers.\nMy impulse is to say, no,\nit seems like it's not like to happen,\nbut I should probably verify\nthat statement with you.\n- Yeah, so quite unlikely.\nI think about growth hormone,\nand especially IGF-1.\nAnd there's actually an IGF-1 and IGF-2.\nBut I think about it in\nterms of endocrine IGF-1,\nmostly IGF-1 that's\nsynthesized in the liver\nand released in the liver\nversus IGF-1 that's released classically.\nAn example of this would be\nyour IGF-1 levels increase\nafter resistance training or exercise.\nAnd that's more of like\nparacrine or autocrine,\nand they have more local action.\nSo that IGF-1,\nit's pretty well studied that\nif you just give people IGF-1,\nit's not going to, at physiologic levels,\nit's not going to improve\ntheir body composition.\nHowever, that IGF-1 that's\nautocrine and paracrine\njust working in those\nlocal tissues and muscles\nis likely part of the reason why you get\na improved body composition\nresponse after exercise.\n- I see, and just to clarify\nfor me and for others,\nwhat can we say are the\nmajor functions of IGF-1\nand IGF-2 that are distinct\nfrom just growth hormone?\nAre they just kind of the\nactive hormone growth hormone?\nThe kind of the pickaxe end\nof the assembly line?\n- Yeah.\nSo they have a much\nlonger duration of action.\nI believe the half-life of IGF-1\nis several days almost a week,\nwhereas growth hormone has\nan extremely fast half-life\nof only hours.\nSo growth hormone acts\nsignificantly on the liver\nto produce IGF-1.\nSo it's around\nin the serum in the blood long enough\nto where it's producing an\neffect pretty much all the time.\n- Very interesting.\n- Yep.\n- Well, and then your\nother pillars, stress,\nwe've talked a lot about\nstress on this podcast before\nand tools for managing stress.\nSleep obviously is a big one.\nI think, if nothing else,\nI will either put people\nto sleep with my podcast.\nCertainly not one,\nbut my solo episodes or\nhopefully convince people\nthat sleep is the foundation of mental\nand physical health and performance.\nAre there any aspects\nof hormone optimization\nthat can improve sleep?\nI know sleep can improve\nhormone optimization,\nbut are there any aspects\nof hormonal optimization\nthat can improve sleep?\nAnd for people that are suffering\nfrom this common syndrome\nof going to sleep and then\nwaking up at 03:00 or 04:00\nin the morning,\nwe know that can be\nassociated with depression,\nbut are there any hormonal\nindications that might lead\nto that kind of situation?\n- Yeah, there's three big ones.\nThe first one is not super common,\nbut it's a very direct correlation.\nIf you have a growth hormone\ndeficiency, a true deficiency,\nwhether you're an adult or a child,\nthen your sleep is likely\ngoing to be affected.\nAnd let's say you're a child\nwith growth hormone deficiency,\nonce that is replaced with therapy,\nyour sleep is going to\nget significantly better.\nThe second one that's\na very common scenario\nis if you're having what's\ncalled vasomotor symptoms\nof menopause or vasomotor\nsymptoms of andropause\nwhich are also applicable.\nAnd that's where your\nprogestogenic activity,\nso your main progestogens are progesterone\nand then and pregnenolone\nand then 5-alpha,\n3-alpha-progesterone, which is-\n- Where are those\nmanufactured in the body?\n- So they're manufactured in a few places.\nIn men, they're manufactured\nsome in the testes\nin the Leydig cells.\nIn women, they're manufactured\nin the ovaries until menopause.\nAnd then they're also\nmanufactured in the adrenal gland.\nSo if you're pre-adrenopausal\nwhere your adrenal glands are\nstill working fairly well,\nusually still have a decent\namount of progesterone around,\nand this can be measured too.\nSo after menopause,\nwomen make progesterone\nfrom their ovaries,\nor sorry, from their adrenal glands.\nIf that progesterone crosses\nthe blood-brain barrier,\nespecially if it's 5-alpha\nand 3-alpha reduced,\nso it's modified a little bit,\nthen it is both a GABA agonist,\nwhich helps sleep just like GABA does,\ngamma-amino butyric acid,\nthe main inhibitory neurotransmitter\nof which lots of things work on,\nalcohol works on GABA as well.\nGabapentin also works on GABA.\nMigraine medicines, many\nof them work on GABA.\nBenzodiazepines, and also non-benzos.\nSo an example of a benzo would be Xanax.\nAn example of a non benzo would be Ambien.\nSo those all work on GABA.\nSo GABA is also helped by\nthe progestogenic activity as well.\nThat's why a lot of women in\nmenopause feel like their sleep\nis much worse is because\nthey have lower activity\nof those progestogens.\n- And for men in so-called andropause,\nlow testosterone, is that\nalso one of the causes\nof poor sleep.\n- Low testosterone can lead to poor sleep,\nnut my third scenario is actually,\nif a man begins TRT,\nthen they develop poor sleep\nbecause of sleep apnea.\nIt drastically raises\nthe risk that somebody\nis going to have sleep apnea.\nAnd then a lot of people,\nespecially when they first started\nin the first month or two,\nit puts them into this\nhypersympathetic state,\nbecause they have overactive\nandrogen receptors,\nespecially after a long\ntime of being hypogonadal.\nThen they have a physiologic dose of TRT\nand that causes the sleep issue itself.\n- Interesting, I have a\nlot of questions about TRT,\ntestosterone replacement therapy.\nI should just mention that when you say\nit increases sympathetic activity,\nyou don't mean that taking testosterone\nincreases sympathy for others.\nIt may in fact do the opposite.\nAlthough it's very clear\nfrom my discussions\nwith my colleagues\nin the endocrinology side and also with\nthe great Dr. Robert Sapolsky\nthat increasing testosterone\nmerely exacerbates existing\nfeatures of people.\nSo the jerks become bigger jerks,\nkind people become even\nmore kind in general,\nbut I want to get into TRT in depth,\nbut it's very interesting to me\nto hear that testosterone\nreplacement therapy increases\nthe risk of sleep apnea.\nAnd I want to make sure that I ask that\nis that also the case in\npeople that are using TRT\nwho are not hypogonadal?\nBecause in the classic situation,\nif somebody isn't making\nenough testosterone,\nthey're below 300 nanograms\nper deciliter on the chart,\nthey go in and take TRT.\nBut many people nowadays, let's be honest,\nare taking doses of testosterone\neven though they are in\nthe sort of standard range,\nbecause the range is so large because\nof other symptomology, is that right?\n- Yeah, I do love the\nanalogy that Dr. Sapolsky had\nabout monks taking testosterone\nand making them more and more generous.\nSo that does appear to be what\ntestosterone usually does,\nis it exacerbates, if you will,\nwhat you're previously like.\nSo it's not going to\nchange you as a person.\nBut if you're eugonadal\nbefore you start testosterone-\n- Meaning?\n- Meaning you have normal testosterone,\nand then you start TRT or\nself-administered TRT,\nsteroids, however you want to look at it,\nthen your risk of sleep\napnea still goes up\nin a dose-dependent fashion.\nSo the higher the dose, the more risky.\nWith the sympathetic and the\nparasympathetic nervous system,\nthe sympathetic is the fight\nor flight nervous system,\nthe parasympathetic is\nthe rest and digest.\nSo if you have too much fight or flight,\nand stress can cause that too,\nthen you're not going to\nrest as well at night.\n- I want to touch on\ntestosterone in women because\nthere is testosterone in women.\nI'd like to know where that\ntestosterone comes from,\nwhich tissues, I'd like to know whether\nor not testosterone replacement\ntherapy make sense in women.\nI'm hearing more and more\nabout women using testosterone.\nAnd I'd like to know\nwhether or not knowing\na woman's testos,\nfor her to know her\ntestosterone is of equal,\nless than or more value\nthan knowing, for instance,\nprogesterone and estrogen levels?\nBecause I think there are a\nlot of misconceptions about\nthe roles of testosterone in women.\n- For health optimization,\ntestosterone is just as important to know.\nFor pathology prevention, for example,\nbreast cancer, osteoporosis,\nestrogen, and progesterone\nare more important to know.\nSo when you're thinking about women,\nwomen think that they\nhave such a tiny amount\nof testosterone, because you test it,\nmost people test a free testosterone,\nso a testosterone that's unbound,\nwhich is by far\nthe smallest proportion of testosterone.\nAny androgen is bound by lots\nof different steroid-binding proteins.\nBut the ones that are most\npertinent are called SHBG,\nor sex hormone-binding globulin.\nAnd that binds the androgenic steroid,\nfor example, DHT or dihydrotestosterone.\nIt's associated with prostate enlargement,\nit's associated with\nmale pattern baldness.\nIt binds that the most strongly,\nand then it binds testosterone\nnext most strongly,\nand then it binds things\nlike androstenedione\nor DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone.\nAnd then it binds the estrogens,\nthe weakest, like estradiol.\nSo if you look at the total\namount of testosterone,\nwomen actually have, almost\nall women, not all women,\nbut almost all of them have\nsignificantly more testosterone\nthan estradiol, but it's because it's\nin different measurements.\nSo estradiol, a lot of\ntime is picograms per mil\nas opposed to nanograms per deciliter.\nSo women have more\ntestosterone than estrogen\nand significantly more DHEA than either.\n- Interesting. Do women\nmake dihydrotestosterone?\n- Yeah.\n- And where does this\ntestosterone come from?\nBecause they don't have testes.\n- Yeah, so most testosterone in women\nthat are premenopausal can come\nfrom theca cells, T-H-E-C-A.\nSo theca cells are cells in the ovaries\nthat can produce testosterone.\nAnd a lot of people have actually\nheard about hyperthecosis,\nnot the term itself.\nBut a lot of Olympians that are,\ntheir chromosomes are XY, they're females,\nand they're not taking any-\n- Wait, they're XY,\nbut they're females?\n- Or sorry, they're XX.\n- Oh, okay.\n- Yeah. Thank you.\nSo they're XX, they're not XY,\nand they have never transitioned or been\non any sort of hormone\nreplacement or testosterone,\nbut they naturally produce a\nhuge amount of testosterone,\nas much as many men.\nAnd some of these women,\nI believe they were from Botswana,\nwere banned from competing in the Olympics\nin certain distances.\nI believe they were banned from\nthe 400 meter and 800 meter,\nbecause their natural testosterone\nwas deemed to be too high.\n- So they mistakenly thought\nthat they were using steroids?\n- They actually knew they\nwere not using steroids.\nThey knew it was their theca cells\nwere just genetically gifted, I suppose.\nAnd they still made them change distances.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- So one or two of these\nathletes changed to,\nI believe it was the 3K or the 5K,\nand they still did quite well,\nbut it was not their best event.\n- Interesting, yeah, that's turning out\nto be a very interesting\nand controversial area\nof this notion of hormone\ntherapies and natural variation\nin hormones on different\nchromosomal backgrounds.\nFascinating, we should probably do\na whole episode about that,\n'cause it's very much of the times.\nSo men and women both make DHT.\nI'd like to ask about DHT in men.\nSo often we hear about testosterone in men\nand free testosterone being\nthe unbound form of course.\nBut dihydrotestosterone, where\ndoes it come from in men?\nWhat is the cascade of events\nthat takes testosterone\nto dihydrotestosterone and what are some\nof the quote/unquote positive\nand negative effects of,\nhere I'm only referring to\nendogenous dihydrotestosterone.\nAnd in fact,\nI'll make it very clear whether or not\nI'm talking about taking something\nor one's own natural production.\nHere we're just,\nI think up until now we've\njust been talking about\nnatural production.\nSo tell us about DHT in men,\nsuch a powerful hormone\nduring development obviously.\nBut what is it doing?\n- DHT is a very androgenic hormone.\nSo whether you're talking about DHEA,\nwhich is a weak androgen,\nor testosterone, which is a\nrelatively strong androgen,\nor DHT, which is a very strong androgen,\nthey bind to the androgen\nreceptor in both men\nand in women.\nSo the effect of all\nthree of those is mediated\nby the androgen receptor.\nThere's a couple different\nbeta-estradiol receptors\nand alpha-estradiol receptors,\nbut there's only one androgen receptor.\nIntriguingly, it is on the X chromosome,\nso men get their androgen\nreceptor gene from their mother.\nWomen get one androgen receptor\ngene from their father,\none from their mother.\nOften the one that is more\nsensitive to androgens\nand people with PCOS, that's\nthe one that's active.\nThe other one is methylated and inactive.\n- Can I just pause you one second?\nSorry to interrupt,\nbut I have to ask this\nquestion before I forget.\nAnd I know a number of people\nare probably wondering,\nI've heard that whether\nor not one develops male pattern baldness,\nwhether or not a male develops\nmale pattern baldness,\njust to be very precise,\nyou could get some information\nabout that by looking\nat your mother's father,\nand that would, in keeping\nwith what you just described,\nthat the X chromosome,\nwhich of course is handed\noff through the mother,\nis carrying the genes that encode\nfor the number and distribution\nof these androgen receptors\nthat DHT will bind to,\n'cause of course,\nI think as you'll probably tell us,\nthat DHD is a responsible\nfor male pattern bald and\nbeard growth, is that right?\nShould I look at my\ngrandfather on my mother's side\nto determine what I'm\nlikely to look like in terms\nof my DHT-ness, is that a word?\n- Yeah, it's the best guess\nthat you could make\npurely from phenotypes.\nNow you can measure your genotype and\nget a better idea of that.\nAssuming that it's true\nmale pattern baldness,\nit's related to the gene transcription\nof the androgen receptor.\nSo I like to think of\nit as how much of this\nandrogen receptor gene is\nactivated by any androgen?\nSo if you have an\nextremely sensitive gene,\nwhich usually means you\nhave very few CAG repeats,\nwhich is basically just\na certain, CAG encodes\nfor a certain amino acid,\nand if you have very few of the repeats,\nthen your androgen\nreceptor gene works better.\nThink of it as a corollary\nto Huntington's disease\nwhere if you have very few of,\ncalled trinucleotide repeats,\nthen it's not as severe as a disease,\nbut after you get more\nand more CAG repeats,\nwhich by the way are,\nin the population you're getting\nmore and more CAG repeats,\nso it's a natural selection of process\nthat has been ongoing for a\nvariety of number of reasons.\nBut anyway if you have more repeats,\nthen that gene activates in the cytoplasm\nand moves to the nucleus\nand causes gene transcription more often\nand hair loss more often.\n- So does that mean that we're\nseeing more hair loss now due\nto elevated levels of DHT\nthan we were 50 years ago?\n- Probably not.\nThe hair loss 50 years ago,\nwell, not 50 years ago,\nbut 500 years ago,\nwas probably more significant,\nbecause on average, 500 years ago,\npeople were more sensitive to androgens.\nSo there's a syndrome called\nandrogen insensitivity syndrome,\nAIS and that syndrome\nwas related to when men,\nwho have the copy from their\nmother who is a carrier,\ntheir AR gene, or androgen receptor gene,\nis completely insensitive.\nSo think of it,\nit's not related to the CAG repeats,\nbut think of that receptor\nas just not working at all.\nSo there's a continuum,\nso everybody's receptor\nworks a little bit better\nor a little bit worse.\nAnd the better your receptor works,\nthe more likely you are to\nhave male pattern baldness.\n- To zoom out from this, but\nstill keeping an eye on DHT,\nwhat do you like to see\nall women in all men do\nto optimize DHT?\nAnd here I'm talking\nabout regardless of age.\nSo we're still in this\nfrom puberty onward phase.\nWe haven't yet micro-dissected\nout decade by decade,\nwhich we will do,\nbut what do you like to see\npeople do to keep DHT in check?\nBut before you tell us that,\ncould you tell us what\npositive things DHT does\nwhen it's in the proper range?\n- Yeah, so DHT helps a lot for,\nit's the same reason\nwhy testosterone helps,\nit activates the antigen receptor gene.\nIt helps effort feel good.\nSo it can be motivating.\nSo that's how it's active in the CNS.\nIt also is active in\ncardiovascular tissue.\nSo if you look at someone\nthat has heart failure\nor if someone has cardiac hypertrophy,\nthe level of DHT can matter\nbecause it's also binding\nto the androgen receptor in the myocardium\nor in the heart itself.\nSo you think of the\nclassic bodybuilder heart.\nIt's an easy example to make.\nThey have very thickened muscle.\nTheir muscle is very strong,\nbecause they're pumping blood\noften with high blood pressure\nand that DHT and the testosterone\nand any DHT derivatives like\nMasteron or oxandrolone,\npreamble and also bind to the heart,\nand they cause even more hypertrophy\nor enlargement of that muscle tissue.\nSo then let's say the person\nstops and they're recovering,\nand they're trying to\nhave cardiac remodeling,\nwhich is where you take\na very thick heart,\nand cardiac remodeling's important\nin a lot of different cardiac pathologies,\nbut if you give them\nfinasteride or dutasteride,\nwhich inhibit the enzyme that\ncan converts testosterone\nto DHT, so making less activity\nat the androgen receptor gene,\nthey have cardiac remodeling,\nand their heart health improves.\n- I see, so for the non-body builder,\nthe typical woman or\nman, younger or older,\nwhat sorts of things support\nDHT, and thereby heart health?\nPresumably DHT she is involved\nin some of the other things\nthat testosterone is famous\nfor in both men and women.\nThings like libido, as you mentioned,\nmaking effort feel good.\nSo motivation, drive and vitality is,\nI guess, could be the general phrase.\nWhat sorts of things support DHT?\nWhat sorts of things\ncreate problems for DHT?\n- There's lots of dietary\nchanges and supplementation\nthat you're probably doing right now\nthat's affecting your DHT.\n- You mean me personally?\n- Well, everybody.\nAll of the listeners.\nBecause let's say you have a diet high\nin plant polyphenols,\nmany of those inhibit the enzyme\nthat converts testosterone to DHT.\n- Could you give us an example\nof one of those, either\nin supplementation form,\nor in food form?\n- Curcumins, certain curcuminoids,\ndepending on the structure,\nwill inhibit the enzyme\ncalled 5-alpha-reductase\nthat converts testosterone to DHT.\n- Turmeric?\n- Yeah. Turmeric.\nBlack pepper extract.\nSo it's used often to\nincrease bioavailability.\nIt's also called BioPerine.\nIt's also a 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor.\nAnd on top of that, people\nhave different genetics too.\nSo some people, they're\n5-alpha-reductase enzymes,\nthere's three of them.\nThey're on chromosome two,\nthree, and four, I believe,\nbut some of them are\nactive in the prostate,\nsome of them are active in the brain.\nAnd so it depends on which tissue,\nthey're tissue-specific\nenzymes that depend on\nhow much DHT you convert.\n- Do you recommend that\npeople avoid curcumin\nand turmeric for that reason?\nAnd is there any specific recommendations\nfor men versus women.\n- If a man or a woman, by the\nway, in women, a lot of times,\nif you just ask your\ndoctor for a DHT check,\nit's the same units as in men,\nso it's essentially undetectable.\nSo you have to,\nespecially if they're\non oral contraceptives,\nwhich is a front topic,\ntheir DHT is very likely undetectable,\nespecially if it's free DHT.\nYou can measure both a DHT and a free DHT.\nBut if someone's DHT is already low,\nor if they have somewhat\ninsensitive androgen receptor\nvia genetics or via lifestyle,\nthen I recommend they avoid\nbioavailable curcuminoids\nlike bioavailable turmeric,\nblack pepper extract,\nand they might be a good\ncandidate for creatine.\nCreatine, like creatine monohydrate,\ncan significantly increase the conversion\nof testosterone to DHT.\n- Interesting, there's also a lot\nof really interesting\ndata coming out now about\nthe role of creatine as a brain fuel,\nand maybe even as a\ncognitive enhancer over time.\nThe data is still ongoing,\nbut some of the studies in\nhumans are pretty impressive,\nat least to me.\nI'm glad you mentioned\nthis thing about curcumin\nand black pepper.\nI wish we had had this\nconversation six years ago,\nbecause I had the experience\nof jumping on the bandwagon\nof the excitement around turmeric,\nand I took a turmeric supplement.\nIt was a couple capsules\nof what I thought to be,\nand I think was high quality turmeric,\nand I've never felt as poor as I did\nin the subsequent few days,\nflat line of, let's just say everything\nthat one would want to have\nin life, energy, vitality,\njust it was a cliff.\nAnd a friend somehow knew that curcumin\ncould inhibit 5-alpha reductase.\nIt converts to testosterone\nto DHT, as you pointed out.\nI stopped taking it,\nit was the only new addition\nto my diet and supplementation,\nand things bounced back\nwithin about three, four days.\nBut it was remarkable.\nI mean, I felt like garbage.\nAnd it was actually kind of frightening\nto experience the sharpness of that cliff.\nBut I know that some people like turmeric\nfor its antiinflammatory\nproperties, et cetera.\nSounds like people either\nneed to experiment,\nand if they do,\nobviously to approach that with caution.\nAnytime you add or remove something,\nyou need to talk to your doctor.\nYou're a doctor, and I'm guessing that\nif one were to experiment,\nwould you say that most of these effects\nof things like curcumin are\nreversible as they were in me?\nOr is there any potential\nof permanent damage\nif people have been taking\nthem for a long time?\n- The effects are nearly always reversible\nwhen you're talking about\n5-alpha reductase inhibition,\nso what turmeric does, but stronger.\nThe most common story\nthat we hear is regarding\na supplement known as saw palmetto,\nwhich a lot of older men take\nfor their prostate health or finasteride,\nwhich you can take for your prostate,\nor your heart, or your\nhair, or dutasteride.\nSo if you're having side effects on these,\nthen it's probably because of\na couple different reasons.\nOne can be your ratio of\nandrogens to estrogens is off,\nand that needs addressed.\nAnother one can be it's\ninhibiting the conversion\nof your progesterone to that\nother type of progesterone,\nthe 5-alpha, 3-alpha, that\nwe talked about earlier\nthat's helping with your\nsleep and your brain,\nand your calmness.\nAnd that's definitely an effect.\nAnother one is depending on\nthe type of supplement or med,\nthey inhibit different isoenzymes\nof that 5-alpha reductase.\nSo if they're just inhibiting one and two,\nthen that's going to be\na different effect than\nif they're inhibiting two and three.\nSo finasteride does two and three,\nsaw palmetto does one and two,\nand then dutasteride does all three.\nThe third one is active in the brain\nand dutasteride inhibits that third one\na little bit weaker in vivo,\nbut strongly in vitro.\nSo it's really hard to parse out.\nYou can use biofeedback\nand experimentation.\nI do think with supplements\nit's safe to experiment.\nThe time that it takes to set in\nis usually about three months.\nSo the risk of, and this is anecdotally,\nthere's been lots of\nresearch published about\nif post-finasteride\nsyndrome is real or fake.\nAnd it is real,\nbut it's one of those things\nthat's a combination of\norganic and inorganic disease.\nAlmost kind of like fibromyalgia\nwhere it's definitely real,\nAnd there's lots of things that\nyou can do to help with it,\nbut it's very unlikely to occur\nif you stop taking your\nsupplement or medication\nafter you have side effects.\n- Interesting, well, I\ncertainly feel better\nwhen I'm taking five grams of\ncreatine monohydrate per day.\nI know most people take\nit for muscle growth\nand tissue repair and things of that sort,\nmainly I think brings water\ninto the muscle tissue,\net cetera, but I take it\nfor the brain effects,\nand also because I like\nto think that it gives me\na little bit of a DHT bump\nthat I can actually see in\nmy blood charts when I've done them.\nI know many people want\nto avoid the hair loss\nthat can sometimes be associated\nwith DHT levels going too high.\nAnd so I've been asked many times,\ndoes creatine monohydrate cause hair loss?\nIt would make sense that\nif creatine increases DHT\nand DHT binding to the androgen receptor\non the scalp can induce hair loss,\nthat that would be the case.\nIs that that true or\nare people just overly\nconcerned about something\nthat's trivial or non-existent?\n- Each male and fem, so yes,\nit can potentially add it.\nI don't like to say it causes it,\nbut it can be a little\nbit more fuel to the fire.\nSo just like everybody has\na different sensitivity\nof their androgen receptor,\nthey have a different\namount of gene transcription\nthat is going to cause\ndeath of the follicle.\nThat's an arbitrary threshold.\nSo you don't really know\nuntil you start losing hair.\n- And if somebody takes\na little bit of creatine\nto increase their DHT,\nmaybe for the cognitive enhancing effects,\nor for whatever reason,\nand they notice a bit more\nhair falling out in the sink,\nand they stop taking it,\nyou said death of the follicle,\nwhich sounds very dramatic.\nAre those little stem cell niches\nthat reside in the follicle,\nwhich hairs grow from,\nare those then abolished,\nlike there's no going back,\nor can one rescue at the hair?\n- It takes months, if they're still there,\nthe hair will come back.\nSo the loss of the hair itself\nis a normal part of the hair cycle.\nSo you have your antigen\nphase, your catagen phase,\nyour telogen phase, and\nthen your hair loss,\nand then a new follow.\n- Of the stem cell niche\nin the hair follicle.\n- Yeah. Yeah.\nThink of it like sharks have teeth.\nSo shark loses a tooth,\nand they have a new\none that comes through.\nOr losing your baby tooth,\nand you have a new one,\nbut your hair just always\nkeeps coming through.\nSo it's natural for it to die and lose.\nThat's that's why when you start\n5-alpha reductase inhibitors,\noften you have a big shed.\nSo what happens during that big shed\nis all of these cells that are unhealthy,\nthey immediately jettison that hair\nand then they start making a\nmuch healthier new follicle.\nSo a lot of the hairs that are\nat the end of their telogen phase,\nthen they have what's\ncalled telogen effluvium,\nwhich also happens after pregnancy,\nalso happens in thyroid pathologies.\nSo you shed it, a new one in place,\nand you think that you're having\na horrible hair loss\ncaused by your finasteride\nor whatever you're doing.\nAnd minoxidil does this too,\nbut you're really just having\na new, healthier follicle.\nIf you go a really long\ntime, if you go a year,\nthen those hairs might come\nback, and they might not.\n- So for simplicity's sake, if\nsomebody is concerned about,\nor is experiencing hair\nloss, male or female,\nwhat are their options of\nways to offset that hair loss\nthat are not going to negatively impact\nother tissues sensitive to DHT?\nAnd what I'm basically saying here is,\nI could imagine taking a DHT inhibitor,\na pill of some sort,\nor an injection of some sort,\nand offsetting hair loss,\nmaybe even stimulate more hair growth.\nIt's clear that I'm not doing that,\nbut I know people that do,\nbut then experience some of\nthe other negative effects\nof blunting DHT, reduced\naffect, reduced libido,\nreduced drive, disruptions\nin prostate function,\nor even sexual function generally.\nSo what can people do\nif they want to maintain\nor grow back hair,\nbut they don't want all\nthose other effects?\nWhat should they avoid\nand what should they\nperhaps consider talking\nto their doctor about?\n- Yeah, there's a whole host of options.\nI try to separate alopecia or hair loss\ninto two different categories,\nmale pattern baldness,\nor androgenic alopecia,\nalso known as androgenetic alopecia,\nversus other types of alopecia,\nusually telogen effluvium.\nAnd if it's androgenetic alopecia\nor male pattern baldness,\neven if they're female,\nperhaps say PCOS, something like that,\nthen you want some sort of\nstrategy to decrease the activity\nof that androgen receptor.\n- So women can get male pattern baldness?\n- [Kyle] Absolutely.\n- Okay, I'm going to have to wrap my head\naround that one, but okay.\n- So there's a lot of different\nthings that you can do\nthat are topical.\nThe most promising is called\ndutasteride mesotherapy.\nEssentially what it is\nis it's very localized injections in areas\nthat are prone to male pattern baldness,\nwhether they're female or male.\nAnd it acts locally only.\nAnd you repeat these\ninjections from time to time,\nit decreases the conversion\nof testosterone to DHT\njust in the scalp.\n- So that can avoid prostate effects.\nAnd what are some of the negative effects\nof blocking D HT in\nfemales, in the periphery?\nMeaning not on the scalp or in the brain?\nWhere is DHT doing its stuff?\n- Yeah, so it's both DHT,\nand then also that 5-alpha,\n3-alpha progesterone,\nwhich is called THP or dihydroprogesterone\nor tetrahydro, trihydroprogesterone.\nSo they're active in the\ncentral nervous system,\nbut it's also just active, again,\nbinding to the androgen\nreceptor in a female as well,\ncausing them to have that\neffort feel good, motivation.\nA lot of women that are sensitive to DHT,\n'cause women can be\nsensitive to DHT as well,\nfeel very different when they\nstart an oral contraceptive,\nnot because it alters\ntheir DHT to a huge amount.\nIt does to some degree.\nBecause the negative feedback inhibition\nin the pituitary and less\nproduced in the ovaries,\nbut it increases SHBG really high.\nSo because their SHBGs\nare significantly higher,\ntheir free DHT is way lower.\n- I see, how does a woman\nknow if she has PCOS,\npolycystic ovarian syndrome?\nWhat are the issues with\npolycystic ovarian syndrome?\nWhat can be done about PCOS?\nI confess, I was naive to PCOS.\nThat wasn't supposed to\nrhyme, but since it does,\nI do confess I was completely naive to it.\nAnd I started getting a\nlot of questions about it\nin various forums.\nAnd I think that's actually the reason\nwhy I initially approached you.\nI know you have treated a lot of PCOS.\nWhat age women should be\nabout PCOS, what's PCOS?\nTeach us about PCOS, please.\n- Yeah, so PCOS is\npolycystic ovarian syndrome.\nAnd this is one of those conditions\nwhich is underdiagnosed.\nSo its prevalence is much\nhigher than we think it is.\nThere's been a lot of studies.\nAnd some studies say a\nprevalence of 10%, some say 20%.\nIt's not completely clinically penetrant.\nSo most people don't know they have PCOS\nuntil they have infertility\nor subfertility.\n- And is PCOS happening at this frequency\nin 20-year old women,\nin 30-year old women,\nin 40 and onward?\n- Most women find out they\nhave PCOS in their 30s,\nespecially, it's on a\nspectrum or a continuum,\nlike a lot of things, where\nyou can have a weaker version,\nor a very severe version.\n- What are the symptoms?\n- There's criteria called\nthe Rotterdam criteria.\nAnd in the Rotterdam criteria,\nthere's a couple different\nways that you can diagnose it.\nYou're looking for androgen\nexcess, insulin resistance,\nand you could also look\nfor polycystic ovaries.\nYou don't actually have to\nhave polycystic ovaries or\nto get an ultrasound of your\novaries to be diagnosed.\nIf you have androgen excess, for example,\nandrogenic acne, or hormonal acne.\nIf you have hair growth,\nlike a hair growth on the\nchin, it's called hirsutism.\nOr if you have,\nlike deepening of the voice,\nany symptom of too much.\nAnd male pattern baldness,\nif you're female,\nthat's a symptom of PCOS as well.\nThen you can also have insulin resistance.\nSo this is obesity.\nIt's pre-diabetes, a high fasting insulin,\na HOMA-IR over two,\na fasting insulin of over six.\nSo if you have significant\ninsulin resistance\nand also androgen dominance,\nthat's a sign of it.\nAndrogen dominance often leads\nto what's called oligomenorrhea.\nSo if you're having more\nthan 35-day intervals\nin between a period or if you\nhave less than nine per year,\nthen that can be a sign\nthat you have oligo,\nwhich means too little,\nmenorrhea which means menses.\nSo that's a very common sign of PCOS.\nIf you have infertility,\nso if you're under the age\nof 35 and you've been trying\nfor more than a year, or if\nyou're over the age of 35,\nand you've been trying\nfor more than six months,\nthen that can also be,\nit's a very common presenting complaint\nwhen somebody presents with PCOS.\n- And assuming that a woman is doing\nall these other things is paying attention\nto the six pillars that\nyou talked about earlier,\ndiet, exercise, caloric\nrestriction, in some cases, right?\nNot everyone needs to\nbe caloric restricted.\nStress, sleep, and sunlight, spirit.\nAssuming that they're\ndoing all those things,\nwhat other things in the realm of diet\nor supplementation can\nhelp them avoid PCOS\nif they have subclinical PCOS\nor they have not developed it,\nbut don't want to develop it?\n'Cause it doesn't sound like a good thing.\n- Yeah, so depending on where they are,\nif they're very strong on the\ninsulin resistance spectrum,\nthen optimizing their body composition,\ndecreasing their body fat,\nand treating that metabolic\nsyndrome can help.\nSo a lot of people ask,\nwell, does everybody that's on,\nlike does everybody need to\nbe on metformin that has PCOS?\nNot necessarily, but\nmetformin is one of the tools\nthat can help with insulin sensitization.\nOther tools that can help are inositol,\nso myo-inositol is an insulin sensitizer.\nIts cousin D-chiro-inositol is\na weak antiandrogen.\nA lot of types of inositol\nhave both of those in it.\nSo depending on if\nyou're a female or a male\nand you're on inositol, the\ntype of inositol does matter.\n- Yeah, this is a very important point.\nJust today I said I'm trying this new\nsupplement inositol for its role in\nperhaps enhancing sleep even further.\nMy sleep's generally pretty good.\nLately it's been a little bit\noff for a number of reasons.\nSo I took it for the\nfirst time last night,\nand I said, I thought it helped,\nand just subjectively, and you said,\n\"What kind of inositol is it,\nbecause inositol is a very\npotent androgen inhibitor.\nIt turns out I was taking myo-inositol,\nwhich is not an androgen inhibitor.\nThe other type that you mentioned,\nwhich is an androgen inhibitor is?\n- D-chiro-inositol.\nIt's usually in a ratio\nof 1 to 25 or 1 to 40,\nin a much lower amount\ncompared to myo-inositol.\n- In a supplement or in the body?\n- In a supplement to\nhelp induce ovulation.\n- But for women who\nhave PCOS who might want\nto try and reduce androgen,\nthen they would perhaps want\nto take a form of inositol\nthat reduce the androgen\nreceptor activity.\nCorrect?\n- Yeah. They want both.\nSo if you're a woman\nand you've ever talked\nto your doctor about getting\non the oral contraceptive\nor spironolactone, which\nis also an anti-androgen,\nbut it happens to be a\npotassium-sparing diuretic\nblood pressure medicine as well.\nD-chiro-inositol might be a better option.\nDIM or diindolylmethane is another kind\nof weak antiestrogen,\nantiandrogen that a lot of\nwomen should consider as well.\n- You mentioned oral contraception.\nI've done a few posts on these.\nLet's just call them,\nthey really are perceptual effects whereby\nit's been demonstrated in\nhumans several times now,\nand what appeared to me\nto be very solid studies\nwhere women that take oral contraceptives,\nthere is both a shift in\ntheir perception of men,\n'cause these studies only\nlooked at heterosexual,\nthe sort of arrangements here,\nwhere women who are on oral contraception,\nbecause it blunts some\nof the peaks and valleys\nof hormone output,\nno longer experience the\nsame peak and valleys\nin their assessment of\nother men's attractiveness.\nSo it sort of flattens their\nperception, so to speak.\nThey still find certain men attractive\nand certain men unattractive,\nbut the degree of difference\nis kind of mellowed out.\nAnd likewise, men,\nthese data say that men\nperceiving women's attractiveness,\nthey still see women on oral\ncontraceptives as attractive,\nbut a woman taking oral\ncontraception eliminates\nthis kind of peak in her attractiveness\nthat men would otherwise perceive.\nIn other words, oral\ncontraceptives are changing\nthe way that we perceive each other,\nat least in terms of these\nmale/female experiments.\nWhat is going on with that?\nIs that because oral contraceptives,\nblunt the increase in\ntestosterone that occurs\njust before ovulation,\nor is it because of a complex cascade?\nWhat is going on? I find this fascinating.\n- Yeah, so there's\ndifferences in how your,\nand I wouldn't use the\nword change necessarily,\nbut alter the severity or alter the\npeak, as you said.\nSo just like TRT is not going\nto change you as a person,\nan oral contraceptive will\nnot change you as a person.\nIt will just change your day\nto day peaks and troughs in\nlibido and attractiveness.\nSo one of the main effects\nof oral contraceptives,\nalmost all of them have\na synthetic estrogen\nand a synthetic progestogen in them.\nOne common type of synthetic\nestrogen is ethanol estradiol.\nThere is another new synthetic estrogen\nthat's out there as well,\nbut that anecdotally,\nthat seems to have even more side effects.\nSo this ethanol estradiol\nis 100 times more potent\nthan endogenous or bioidentical\nestradiol in the liver.\nSo it binds to the estrogen\nreceptor in the liver,\nand it's going to increase\nsex hormone-binding globulin,\nwhich secondarily, as you mentioned,\ndecreases your free testosterone,\nand especially your free DHT.\nSo that little testosterone\nhump that you get\nwhen you're a female that's ovulating,\nthat's really flatlined and\nit's a pretty insignificant difference.\nIt's not negligible,\nbut it's a little bit of a hump\nand you have significantly less\nof that when you're on\na oral contraceptive.\n- And does that blunt the\nassociated increase in libido\nthat normally would occur from\nthat increase in androgen?\n- Yes.\n- Yeah. Interesting.\nAnd what about other forms\nof contraception, right?\n'Cause there are, there's copper IUD,\nthere's various implants.\nThere's rings, there's a huge number\nof different forms of these.\nSo what we're talking\nabout is, as I understand,\nit is only the effect of\noral contraception that\nimpacts hormone output.\nIs that correct?\n- Yeah, there's a lot of\nother effects as well.\nFor example, your choice\nof synthetic progestin\nwill alter how high your\nplatelets and SHBG go.\nIt appears to be the higher your platelets\nand the higher your SHBG,\nthe your higher risk of a blood clot.\nSo a lot of women know that if they're\non a oral contraceptive\nand they're already\npredisposed to a blood clot\nor a venous thromboembolism,\nin their vein they have a blood clot\nin either their leg, or their lung,\nthen it can increase that chance.\nSo you can choose a synthetic\nprogestin that is not going\nto have as high of a response,\nbut there's various pros and cons.\nSome synthetic progestins are\nweak anti-androgens as well.\nFor example, there's one known as Slynd,\nwhich is made from spironolactone.\nSo some women are on\nspironolactone and that as well,\nwhich is made from spironolactone,\nwhich probably isn't\nparticularly necessary\nunless they need it for a\ndiuretic or a hypertensive effect.\n- I see, I'm just going to\nintentionally interrupt,\nand I apologize,\nbut specifically because\nI wanted to ask about,\nthere is this notion\nthat oral contraception taken\nover long periods of time\ncan disrupt fertility in\nways that are independent\nof just the age-related\ndecrease in fertility.\nIs that true?\n- It depends on what\nyou mean by a long time.\n6 to 12 months, it's possible.\nPast that, it seems very unlikely.\nHowever, the persistently elevated SHBG\ncan be present for quite some time.\n- Wait, so if a woman\ntakes oral contraception\nfor 6 to 12 months and then stops,\nwill she essentially be aware\nshe would've been anyway\nin terms of her fertility at that age?\nOr are you saying that it\ncan cause permanent damage?\n- Her fertility would be equitable\nas if she had never taken it\nif she's certainly 12 months,\nbut probably six months off.\n- And what if she...\nI know of women that have\ntaken an oral contraception\nfor many years are, in addition\nto the age-related decline\nin fertility that occurs\nthat's inevitable,\nof course the slope is going\nto be different depending\non the individual,\nbut are they\nquickening the transition to infertility?\n- Probably not, you could make a case that\nbecause they've been on\na oral contraceptive,\nthey may have been\nslightly more predisposed\nto insulin resistance\nand/or lower lean body mass.\nBut that's probably going to\nbe a negligible difference\ncompared to their resistance training\nand also their caloric restriction\nor caloric maintenance so-\n- And of course there are also\neffects of having children.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\nRight, I mean on all\nthese parameters, right?\n'Cause it's a major\nlifestyle shift, right?\nThat obviously people contend with\nand have since the beginning\nof human time anyway.\nI want to ask some questions\nabout male hormone therapy\nand male hormones generally.\nBut before I do that,\nI have a couple of burning questions\nthat I get very often that\nI'm just going to insert now.\nMarijuana, I've heard that\nit can decrease testosterone\nin men and women.\nI've heard that it can\nincrease testosterone.\nAlcohol, I think there's general consensus\nthat high alcohol intake,\nhigh barbiturate intake does\nin fact reduce testosterone.\nWhat about modest increase of alcohol?\nI'm not a drinker, so I'm not\nasking these questions for me.\nI don't smoke pot, and whatever.\nI just never really liked\nmarijuana or alcohol.\nThey're not my thing.\nBut many people want to\nknow the answers to these.\nAnd the data that I've\nseen are very confused\nand conflicting, so what about marijuana,\ndoes it reduce testosterone to\na significant degree or not?\n- Cannabinoids itself,\nwhether it's THC or CBD,\nare not going to reduce\ntestosterone by themself.\nIf it's smoked marijuana,\nthen it's very likely to\nincrease your aromatase,\nwhich increases your estrogen.\nAnd that's going to,\nit's aromatizing from testosterone.\nSo that is going to decrease testosterone.\nWhen you have an increased\nestrogen, like estradiol,\nthat's going to work on your pituitary\nto make less hormones that\ncause release of testosterone.\nSo you're going to have\nless LH and less FSH.\nSo it's almost kind of like\nopiates are well known to,\nopiate agonists, they're\ngoing to decrease LH and FSH\nand subsequently testosterone.\nSmoked marijuana will as well.\nAs far as alcohol,\nhigh alcohol will decrease testosterone\nas will any very potent GABA agonist,\nwhether it's a barbiturate,\nor benzodiazepine, or\na non-benzo or alcohol,\nthey're definitely going to.\nModerate alcohol, I guess it\ndepends on what your definition\nof that is.\nThe American Heart-\n- I guess I'm thinking like,\nsome people I know that\ndon't seem to be alcoholics,\nat least by my assessment,\nwill have a glass or two\nof wine four nights a week,\nwhich to me seems like\na tremendous amount,\nonly because I don't like alcohol.\nI don't have a problem with\nother people liking alcohol,\nbut I think for many people\nthat would be considered low\nor moderate intake.\n- Yeah, I would consider that low intake.\nThe American Heart\nAssociation for men recommends\nbetween one and two\ndrinks a day on average.\n- They recommend it?\n- So around, yeah.\nSo around one per week.\n- Wait, so I'm making\nmy heart less healthy\nby not drinking alcohol.\n- Yeah, they recommend a very low amount\nof alcohol intake for men.\nFor women, they recommend zero to one.\nSo that's kind of hard to\ninterpret, zero to one.\nBut the protective effect of alcohol,\nespecially if it's a red wine\nwith polyphenols in it,\noutweighs the deleterious effect.\n- Interesting, 'cause I've\nseen some studies that point\nto the idea that even\nlow intake of alcohol\nover a prolonged period of time\nmight actually decrease brain volume\nor at least volume of\nparticular brain areas.\nBut of course we don't\nknow the consequence\nof decreasing the volume of\na given brain area either.\nI mean, one can imagine\nit's decreasing the size\nof one's amygdala and\nmaking them less stressed.\nAlthough there's no\nevidence to support that.\nI've been told that I need\nto drink many, many times,\nbut I always reply that I\ndon't need to drink anything\nin order to speak my mind.\nSo again, individual differences.\nVery interesting, so it sounds\nlike smoked marijuana may\nin fact reduce testosterone\nor at least increase the conversion\nof testosterone to estrogen, correct?\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\n- And with alcohol and GABA agonists,\nit's important to remember\nthat it shouldn't be daily.\nSo one drink of alcohol a day\nis actually very mildly immunosuppressive.\nSo it's better to have two\ndrinks of alcohol one day\nof the week and then two more drinks\nof alcohol another day of\nthe week and then no alcohol\nthe rest of the time.\nThe same could be said\neven for supplements\nthat have GABA in them.\nA lot of sleep supplements\nhave gamma-aminobutyric acid,\nwhich is GABA, so-\n- Yeah, I occasionally take,\noh, sorry to interrupt.\nI occasionally take 100\nto 200 milligrams of GABA\nin order to enhance sleep.\nBut I do it maybe every\nthird or four nights.\nNo more than three or four nights a week.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- That's perfect.\n- Okay.\n- So there's a lot of sleep supplements\nthat should not be taken daily\nand GABA's one of them.\nAnother one of them is Trazodone.\nAnd melatonin is kind of arguable\nand it depends on the situation.\nBut in general, if you're\ntaking a sleep supplement,\nit should not be taken every night.\n- The sleep supplements that\nI understand are okay to take\nevery night or nearly every night\nare things like magnesium 3 and 8,\napigenin, if that's not true, correct me.\nI certainly take them every night\nunless I forget them back\nhome when I'm traveling.\n- Magnesium's one of the exceptions.\nL-theanine is also another exception.\n- Great, well then at least\nI haven't put anything\ninto the world that's\nwrong in that category yet.\nAnd hopefully I won't.\nBut if I do, I'll correct myself.\nSo let's talk about testosterone in males.\nYou see these headlines all the times now\nthat testosterone levels are dropping,\nsperm counts are dropping.\nPhenotypes of men are changing over time.\nAnd I can't quite follow\nthe literature on that,\nbecause obviously those are\nhard controlled experiments\nto do, because techniques\nchange over time,\nand sensitivity of\ntechniques change over time.\nBut regardless, I'm aware\nthat a lot of people\nare considering increasing\ntheir testosterone by taking testosterone.\nA few years ago that was\nconsidered steroid use,\nand it was really extreme kind of stance.\nNowadays it seems like there's\nmore discussion about it.\nFirst off I'd like to know\ndoes testosterone supplementation,\nand here I'm talking about\nprescription from a doctor,\ndoes it make one more\nprone to prostate cancer?\nThat seems to always be the\nfirst question that comes out.\n- Yeah, and there is a huge amount\nof misinformation about this too.\nSo testosterone is not going\nto cause a prostate cancer.\nHowever, normal aging\ncauses prostate cancer\nand testosterone will\ngrow your prostate cancer.\nSo if you're a 80-year-old\nmale and you have an autopsy\nand there's at least say 50%\npercent chance that you have\na prostate cancer, if\nyou're 90 or 100 years old,\nthere's at least a 90% chance.\nSo for humans with a prostate,\nit's only a matter of time\nuntil you get a prostate cancer.\nSo that begs the question,\ndo you want to take something\nthat's going to grow it\nfor sure once you have it?\nSo it's an individual assessment\nand it's important to follow\nthings like PSAs as well.\n- So a PSA of four or less, I mean,\nideally you wouldn't be at four,\n'cause that's kind of the upper threshold,\nis the simplest read out of whether\nor not there's excessive prostate growth.\nThere's benign prostate hyperplasia\nwhere the prostate is growing,\nbut it's non-cancerous, correct?\nAnd then of course there\nare the symptomologies,\nlike people have\nchallenges with urination,\nthey have sexual difficulties, et cetera.\nI'm always struck by the correlation\nthat people draw between testosterone\nand prostate health and the fact that,\nor I should say the claim\nthat testosterone makes\nprostate health worse.\nBecause if you think about it,\nyoung males have high testosterone often,\nif not always, or certainly often.\nAnd you don't see a lot\nof prostate overgrowth\nand cancer in young males.\nSo something's going on here.\nHow should we conceptualize this?\n- So if you have a PSA of 3.9\nand you're a 25-year-old male\nversus a 75-year-old male\nand you have a PSA of 5.9,\nthe 3.9 PSA is significantly\nmore concerning.\nSo think of your prostate\nas taking cumulative damage\nfrom, not only testosterone,\nbut also estrogen and also growth hormone.\nSo that's why obese individuals\nhave higher incidences of\nprostate cancer as well,\nis because they don't have\nthose cell checkpoints\nwhere your immune system takes\na second and says, all right,\nstop replicating as fast prostate cells.\nLet's see if there's any atypical ones\nand then it finds those\nand it prevents them from reproducing.\nThat's why immunotherapy\nin cancer is so promising\nis because they can target\nthese certain things.\nSo the older male is going to have\nthat cumulative damage happen already\nand arguably prostate cancer is a normal,\nwith aging, fast aging is abnormal.\nVery slow aging is normal.\nThere's a fine line to\nwalk between those two.\nBut there's a lot of\nthings that can be done\nto decrease the turnover,\ndecrease the inflammation,\nand decrease the congestion\nof the prostate over time.\nThere's also a lot more than\njust PSAs that can be done.\nThere's prostate MRIs and things like that\nthat can look at the structure\nand the function of the prostate.\n- So what should every male do\nto maintain the health of their prostate?\nAnd I realize that younger males\nprobably aren't thinking about it at all.\nAlthough it seems like\nnowadays I get these kind of\nwhat I call cryptic questions.\nI think women are more comfortable talking\nabout their hormone and sexual\nhealth because of they cycle,\nbecause of menstrual cycles.\nThey're used to fluctuations\nthat sort of give them\nthe experience of what it's\nlike to have different levels\nof progesterone, estrogen,\ntestosterone, et cetera.\nBut I get these kind of\ncryptic questions often\nin my direct messages\nwhere what I think people are asking is,\nis there something wrong with my prostate?\nWhat should I do for my prostate?\nThese are often indirect questions\nfor other aspects of their\nlife where they're suffering.\nAnd I don't say that ingest.\nI think more direct\ndiscussion would be great.\nSo what should all males do\nto maintain prostate health\nthroughout the lifespan?\n- Maintaining prostate health\ncan be looked at similarly\nhow you can maintain a good\nnatural optimal testosterone.\nSo you look for things that can hurt it.\nYou don't necessarily look for one thing\nthat can improve it or boost it.\nSo for young males, those are prostatitis,\nso it goes hand in hand with epididymitis.\nSo different infections of the prostate.\nThe younger the male is,\nthe more likely it is related\nto something that could\nbe sexually transmitted.\nBut another very common cause\nis what we call gram negative\nand anerobic bacteria.\nThe prostate is right\nby the end of the colon.\nSo if you have chronic constipation\nor if you have colitis or if you,\neven just an E-coli\novergrowth in the colon\nis very likely to cause an infection\nof the prostate as well.\n- What should males do to prevent that?\n- Have a diet that has good,\nhealthy prebiotic fiber,\nprobiotics as well.\nMake sure that they're having\nregular bowel movements,\nthat they don't have chronic constipation.\nHave good sources of dietary fiber,\nwhich is also as soluble fiber,\nand enough insoluble fiber.\nMost people get enough\ninsoluble or non-dietary fiber.\nSo that can help prevent the\nchance of diverticulitis,\nwhich is another type of infection.\nIt can also decrease the chance of colitis\nand decrease the chance of\nprostate infections as well.\n- Are there any foods and/or supplements\nthat men should take or avoid?\nWhat about, you hear\nor about saw palmetto,\nyeah, supplements for,\nor supplements that support\nor cause issues for the prostate?\n- Yeah, if there's a strong\ngenetic predisposition\nto enlarged prostates,\nor even just really early\nprostate cancers that grow fast,\nthen they could consider\ntaking saw palmetto\nor even curcumin as an anti-androgen,\nas long as they're able to tolerate it.\nIt's an individualized basis\nand depends on their history.\nAs far as making sure that\ntheir prostate is not congested,\nthere's an interesting\ncorrelation between having girls\nand having prostate cancer.\n- Having girl offspring?\n- Yeah.\n- So if your offspring are females,\nthen you're slightly more\nlikely to have prostate cancer.\nThere's hypotheses that link\nestrogen to prostate cancer\nrather than testosterone.\nSo if you have hypoestrogenism,\nyour prostate has more atypical cells.\nIn general, the higher\nyour C-reactive protein,\nwhich is the general marker\nof inflammation in your body,\nwe call it CRP, and the\ntest order is hsCRP,\nor high-sensitivity CRP.\nIf your CRP raises up very high,\nif you have an autoimmune disease,\nlike if you have a Crohn's\nflare or if you have lupus\nor an infection or a sexually\ntransmitted infection,\nor even a colitis, or even the flu,\nyour CRP is going to raise significantly.\n- That you would detect in a blood test\nof course.\n- Correct.\nYeah.\n- Yeah.\n- So you want to get a baseline CRP\nwhen you haven't had any\nof those things recently.\nAnd if your CRP is higher,\nyou also have more female offspring.\nIf your CRP is higher,\nthen your reactive oxygen species,\nwhich are causing mutations\nand atypical cell turnover\nin the prostate are also likely higher.\nSo you want to keep a very low CRP.\n- Interesting, and what about blood flow,\nand pelvic floor in general?\nWe should probably do a whole\nepisode on pelvic floor.\nThere's so much interesting\ndata coming out of\nthe fields of clinical\nand research urology.\nI realize it's kind of the Netherlands\nof biology and medicine.\nPeople probably aren't\nthinking so much about this,\nbut pelvic floor is obviously a confluence\nof a ton of of vasculature, of nerves,\nand of course the prostate resides there.\nAnd of course the genitals\nreside there as well.\nSo I would imagine that\none of the six pillars,\nexercise, being able to\nmaintain adequate blood flow\nto those regions is key.\nWhat about just postural things?\nPeople sitting too much,\nnot hydrating well enough,\nyou mentioned avoiding constipation.\nWhat are some other things,\nincluding medications that can\nserve to support the prostate\nover time and maybe even\nsupport pelvic floor in general,\nboth in males and females over time?\n- Absolutely, and this is something\nthat's rightfully getting\nmore and more attention.\nThe way I explain the pelvic\nfloor is your abdominal cavity,\nwhich includes your\nperitoneum or where most\nof your organs are, your\nretroperitoneum, your pelvic space.\nThink of it as a box.\nAnd your abs are the front of the box.\nYour back muscles are the back.\nYour diaphragm is the top of the box.\nAnd your pelvic floor,\nthat's where your port\nis to the outside world.\nEspecially important,\nit has muscles as well.\nAnd you can do exercises.\nPelvic floor physical\ntherapists are becoming more\nand more utilized,\nespecially after childbirth,\nbut in other situations as well,\nincluding by men getting\ncare from urologists.\nSo you want to both strengthen\nthat pelvic pelvic floor\nand make sure that the\ntubes that are docked\nto the outside world\nare working well enough,\nbut they're not too loose.\nThey're not working too well.\nSo there's a lot of medications\nthat can be positives\nor negatives for your pelvic floor.\nWe kind of talked about your gut\nand colon health in general.\nAs far as your prostate health\nand as far as your bladder\nand urinary system health,\nyou think about a couple\ndifferent classes.\nSo you have your phosphodiesterase.\nYou have your tadalafil.\nBasically this is going to\nhelp decrease congestion\nin the prostate.\nA lot of people take it for ED,\nbut it can actually\nhelp you decrease your-\n- Could you define that?\n- A lot of men take to\ntadalafil, generic is Cialis,\nhas a much longer half-life\nthan Viagra or Levitra.\nIts half-life is almost a day.\nSo you can take a very low dose of it.\nInstead of taking 20 milligrams,\nyou take two or two and a half milligrams.\n- So you're saying that\na lot of men take it\nfor erectile dysfunction?\n- Yes.\n- But that at it at lower doses,\nit may have served purposes\nfor prostate health,\nindependent of erection?\n- Correct, the most common\nscenario is if a male\nis waking up twice at\nnight to pee, on average,\nit'll cut that down to once.\nSo if they're waking up\nat four times at night,\nthen it can cut that\ndown to twice at night,\njust because you have easier blood flow.\nWe used to use other\nmedications like Flomax,\nwhich is tamsulosin.\nThat's an alpha antagonist,\nso it basically binds to a\nreceptor in smooth muscle,\nand it helps relax that.\nThere's several other alpha antagonists.\nAnd then you also have your medications\nthat are hormonal like finasteride\nthat a lot of people\ntake for prostate health\nto decrease the enlargement\nof the prostate.\nThe periurethral area,\nor periurethral lobe,\nthere's several lobes of the prostate,\nthat tends to be especially\nenlarged in cases of BPH and-\n- BPH?\n- Prostate hyperplasia\nor an enlarged prostate.\nAnd if you are able to shrink that area,\nthen at that point, it's\njust a plumbing problem.\nAnd the urine is able to get by easier.\n- Yeah, my understanding is\nthat now there's a growing,\nI don't want to say a movement, [chuckles]\nbut the idea of taking very low dose,\nlike 2.5 milligram or\n5 milligram tadalafil,\neven daily is becoming pretty common\nfor many men who do not\nhave erectile dysfunction,\nsimply to either maintain\nor enhance prostate health.\nIs that correct?\n- Yeah, that's correct.\n- And do you see any negative\neffects of doing that?\n- There can be negative effects.\nIt can lower blood pressure.\nSo theoretically it can\nincrease your chance\nof vasovagal syncope.\nA lot of people take it\nas a alternative to pump,\nbecause it kind of works\nsimilarly to citrulline,\nor different pump products in pre-workout,\nand it can certainly help with that.\nBut if you're about to go do a deadlift\nwhere you might pass out anyway,\nit can certainly increase\nthe chance of that happens,\nbecause you don't have\nthat compensatory exercise,\nhypertension response.\n- Could someone just take\nit away from exercise?\n- They could, if you took tadalafil,\nthen that's going to be,\nhas a long half-life.\nWhereas Viagra and Levitra\nis just a few hours,\ntadalafil almost today.\nSome interesting studies on\nViagra have been done as well.\nIt can potentially alter your\nrays and cones in your eye.\nSo the usual recommendation\nfor pilots that need\nto have red-green discrimination\nfrom very long distances\nwith very small indicator lights\nis to not take Viagra.\nSo I usually say\nif you're a pilot and\nthat's your profession,\nperhaps hold off from that for a while.\nThere's also studies with\nViagra that significantly,\nwhich is also known as\nsildenafil as the generic now,\nit can increase eyebrow hair growth.\nSo potentially what it\ndoes is it helps vasodilate\nand relax the veins,\nespecially in older men.\nAnd when those veins are relaxed,\nyou have better blood flow.\nThat's one of the proposals or theories\nbehind why older men get the\nandrogenetic alopecia more.\nYou're having less\nblood flow in the scalp.\nSo theoretically it can\nalso help prevent that,\nbut it's not going to-\n- So in theory,\nincreasing blood, oh,\nbecause it increases\nblood flow systemically\nthroughout the body?\n- Yeah.\n- Not just in specific tissues.\nWell, I find it incredibly\ninteresting that, yeah,\nthere are these online\nforums building up now\naround low dose tadalafil,\ndaily use of low dose tadalafil, again,\nnot for sexual or erectile dysfunction,\nbut for sake of longterm prostate health.\nIs there any reason why women might want\nto take low dose tadalafil?\n- tadalafil is also a weak\nandrogen receptor sensitizer,\nkind of like L-carnitine,\nwhere the density of the\navailable androgen receptors\nto bind increases slightly.\nSo there could potentially\nbe a benefit from that,\nbut most of the time it's used in men.\n- Very interesting, we\nhaven't really talked\nabout testosterone and\noptimizing testosterone in males.\nAssuming someone is paying\nattention to the six pillars,\nthere's kind of a gap as, I see it,\nbetween doing all those things and TRT,\nhormone replacement therapy.\nAnd again, the R, the replacement in TRT\nis a little bit of in quotes nowadays,\nbecause a lot of people\nwho have testosterone\nin that 300 to 900 nanogram\nper deciliter range opt\nto take low dose testosterone anyway.\nMy understanding is that\nthere have been some new kind\nof movements in this area\ntoward, for instance,\nnot doing big, large doses\ninjected infrequently,\nbut rather low doses quite frequently,\nobviously prescribed by a doctor,\nmonitored by a doctor, et cetera.\nIs that generally what you\nlike to see in your patients\nif they're going to take this route?\n- If they're a hypogonadal patient\nwhose benefits outweigh risks of TRT,\nthen you want to have a\nnice even steady state.\nIt's not going to be exactly the same\nas producing pulsatile\ntestosterone release endogenously\nfrom your own body.\nWhen you have a steady state,\nyou don't have a peak or a trough.\nAnd when you have a peak,\nthat's when the antigen\nreceptor gene is overactive,\nthat's when you get more\nerythropoietin or EPO release,\nand that leads to a lot of the\nside effects of thick blood,\nso higher hemoglobins, and hematocrits.\nAnd then when you have a\ncrash, you don't feel good.\nSo it's definitely not optimal.\nThere's a lot of ways to get around this.\nSo when you're doing\ntestosterone replacement,\nif you're someone that needs it,\nyou can have different types of esters,\nor you could do topical testosterone.\nSo the Ester is basically something\nthat's attached to increase\nthe biological half-life.\nThe most common ones are\ncypionate, enanthate,\nthere's also a very\nshort-acting propionate,\nwhich has almost no clinical relevance.\nAnd there's also very long-acting ones,\ndecanoate, and undecanoate,\nand different mixtures of all those.\nSo if you're someone who\nhas a very, very low SHBG,\nyou're going to have trouble of regulating\nyour serum testosterone in the long run.\nIf you do it topically,\nthen the testosterone is\nabsorbed, hopefully bound to SHBG,\nand then a lot of times\nyou reapply twice daily\nor once daily, but you\nhave lots of variations.\nSo for most people,\nespecially for people\nwho can't absorb it well,\nthat's not going to be a great option.\nSo injections would be preferred.\nMost people end up injecting,\nbecause they have either\nside effects from too high,\ntoo low, or just too much of a varied dose\nwhen they do topical.\nThere's also a capsule with a\nspecial lymphatic absorption.\nSo it's not being absorbed\nthrough the liver,\nit's not hepatically metabolized,\nbut it's absorbed through the lymph.\nAnd it's essentially\ntestosterone undecanoate,\nand then put into a capsule.\nAnd that's taken twice daily.\nIt has fairly steady half-lifes,\nbut you have to take it at\nspecific times of the day.\nSo that being said,\nand it's new enough to where\nthere isn't a huge amount\nof data on it, but it is FDA approved.\nSo it is brand name now.\nit's called JATENZO.\nBut the injectables in general,\nthe lower your SHBG, the\nlonger of an ester you want,\nbecause when you inject it,\nwhether it's intramuscular\nor subcutaneous,\njust talk to your doctor about the risks\nand the benefits of those.\nSubcutaneous has slightly\nlonger active half-life,\nbecause the esterases take longer to reach\nthat supinate or an estered clavate.\nSo most men, a lot of\npeople ask me about like\nwhat a usual dose is.\nFor most people, it would\nbe a total of about 100\nto 120 per week for an\nactual replacement dose.\n- Milligrams?\n- Milligrams.\n120 to 100 milligrams per week\nadministered two to three times per week.\n- And you're not, so you're\nsaying dividing that into two\nor three, right?\n'Cause I'm sure a bunch of\npeople out there are thinking,\noh yeah, 103 times a week,\nwhich is actually quite a high dose.\nYeah, there really does seem to be a shift\ntoward spreading these dosages out into,\ndividing them into two\nor three smaller doses.\nAnd then along those lines,\n5, 10 years ago,\nit was common to hear\nabout inhibiting estrogen\nthrough aromatase inhibitors.\nNowadays you hear, and I think it's true,\nat least by my read of the literature,\nthat inhibiting estrogen\ncan disrupt brain function,\ncan cause connective tissue issues,\nand even can cause reductions in libido.\nSo a lot of people think they estrogen,\nif you crash estrogen, that\nbasically libido goes up,\nbut actually the opposite is often true.\nYou don't want estrogen\ntoo high or too low,\nis that correct?\nAnd for that reason,\ndo you shy away from people\ntaking aromatase inhibitors?\n- Yeah, very few people truly\nneed aromatase inhibitor.\nThere's almost always\nlifestyle interventions.\nIt can just depend on which gene,\nhow active your aromatase gene is.\nSome people's aromatase\ngene is very active.\nA lot of times these individuals\nhave pubertal gynecomastia,\nwhich is breast tissue growth in males,\neven despite no other risk factor.\n- Even if they're lean?\n- Some people get it if they're lean.\n- I remember growing up-\n- It's possible.\n- There were a few kids\nthat got mild cases\nof gynecomastia that were transient.\nLike it's sort of like\nthey developed gynecomastia\nand then it went away.\n- Often it's unilateral on one side too.\nSo growth hormone a lot of\ntimes is the fuel to that fire.\n- Oh, interesting.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, there were a couple of kids.\nI mean, they took some\nteasing 'cause back then,\nthere wasn't online\ndiscussions about hormones\nand things like that, but\nthen it would seem transient.\nAnd they were,\nthe people I'm thinking of\nwere actually lean individuals.\nSo they weren't overweight,\nwhich of course can cause gynecomastia,\nbecause adipose fat tissue\ncan convert testosterone into estrogen.\nSo it sounds like,\nexcept in special cases,\nthat avoiding aromatase inhibitors\nis probably going to be a good idea.\n- Yeah, there's several other ways\nthat you can control\nyour estrogen and keep it\nat a healthy level, which\nyou do have to check.\nThere's a lot of patients who assure me\nthat their estrogen's going to be sky high\nand it's actually very low and vice versa.\nBut calcium D-glucarate is a supplement\nthat can help with estrogen control.\n- What's a typical dosage\nof calcium D-glucarate?\n- 500 To 1,000 milligrams.\n- But is there the risk\nthat if someone's estrogen\nis in normal range and\nthey take the supplement,\nthat their estrogen will go too low?\nIs it that potent?\n- It's not that potent.\nIt's not near as potent\nas an aromatase inhibitor.\nSo it helps with excretion\nand also the sensitivity\nof the estrogen receptor itself.\nAnd it kind of like helps outcompete it.\nSome people will also take DIM\nor different cruciferous vegetable,\nthey get 'em from cruciferous\nvegetables like kale but,\nor broccoli and that\nis both an antiestrogen\nand an antiandrogen.\nSo if you're on TRT and you're on that,\nthen you're probably just on too much TRT.\n- Yeah, I remember a few\nyears ago I had a friend,\nand it truly is, it's not\nlike I have a friend thing,\n'cause I'm very cautious just about\nwhich supplements I take.\nI think people might get the impression\nthat I'm very cavalier\nabout this, but I'm not.\nI always alter one thing at a time.\nI talk to physicians.\nWhat I suggest other\npeople do I actually do\nand have done for a long period of time.\nAnd I recall wanting to take\nDIM, 'cause I thought, well,\nback then you hear, okay, reduce estrogen.\nMy estrogen levels weren't out of range,\nso they were fine, but I thought, well,\nwhat would the experience\nbe of bringing those down?\nBut someone I know is quite\ninformed in this area said,\nyeah, exactly what you said,\nwhich is that DIM can reduce estrogen,\nbut also testosterone.\nSo I just never opted to try and take it.\nI do want, we're sort of\nairing in this direction,\nbut we went straight from\nthe six pillars to TRT\nor to what some people\nnow call sports TRT,\nwhich is basically code language\nfor saying taking exogenous testosterone\neven though one doesn't\nneed it to get into\na semi-super physiological\nrange or a high end,\nlike 900 to 1,000 nanogram\nper deciliter range.\nAnd people always point out,\nI should mention that, oh,\nwell in certain countries,\nthe high end range is 1,200\nnanograms per deciliter.\nIn the US, it's 900.\nAnd so if you're 1,200, are\nyou really super physiological?\nAll that aside,\nI neglected to ask about\nthat gap in between\nwhere individuals could\nthink about supplementation,\nmeaning non-prescription approaches\nto increasing testosterone,\nand here we should probably\nalso talk about things like,\nis it true that ice baths\nincrease testosterone or not?\nLifestyle factors that\ngo beyond the six pillars\nfor increasing testosterone.\nIf you could comment on\nthose, that would be terrific.\nSupplements that are useful.\nAnd it'd be wonderful if you could mention\nwhere some of these same practices\nand supplements might be\nuseful for women as well as men\nto increase testosterone\nfor all the reasons we\ntalked about earlier.\n- Yeah, so this is where\na true individualized approach comes in.\nWhen you're talking about what\ndose of TRT you should be on,\none thing to keep in mind is\nthe law of diminishing returns.\nQuality of life is a subjective thing\nand it's different for each person.\nSo some people are more willing to give up\na little bit of athleticism\nor body composition.\nSome people are more willing to give up,\nor not willing to give up\nlibido or sexual health.\nAnd as we mentioned earlier,\neverybody's androgen receptor\nis less or more sensitive.\nSo you can make a case that if\nsomebody's androgen receptor\nis half as sensitive as somebody else,\nthe person with the less\nsensitive receptor does need\na level of 1,000 or 1,200.\nThere's no great way to know that.\nAnd you can alter the sensitivity\nof your androgen receptor\nwith things like L-carnitine\nand tadalafil as mentioned.\n- And we'll definitely\ncome back to L-carnitine,\nbecause I'm really intrigued\nby the data on L-carnitine,\nboth for women and men\nin terms of egg quality,\nsperm quality, fertility,\nand a bunch of other interesting effects.\nSo we'll come back to L-carnitine.\n- But a lot of how you feel,\nthe biofeedback or subjective,\nI feel like this, comes from the ratio\nof your androgens to your estrogens.\nAnd a lot of that is lifestyle.\nSo if someone's also on hCG,\nthat could upregulate aromatase as well.\n- hCG, you might want to just,\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin?\n- [Kyle] Yeah.\nUsed to be found in pregnant,\nis still found in pregnant women's urine.\n- Still found in\npregnant women, yeah.\n- But used to be,\nbelieve it or not,\nthere was a black market\nfor pregnant women's urine\nbefore this stuff was\ndeveloped synthetically.\nSo in other words, what\nwe're saying is men typically\nwould buy pregnant women's urine\nthrough black markets\nin order to get the hCG\nin order to get the\ntestosterone-enhancing effects of hCG.\nSo in other words,\nmen were using pregnant\nwomen's urine for hCG.\nI do not want to how they\ngot it into their body.\nLet's just skip to what you\nwere going to say next instead.\n- Yeah. So that's hCG.\nThere's a lot of other things\nthat upregulate estrogen.\nAlcohol significantly increases aromatase.\nSo if you're very sensitive to estrogen,\nthen you probably shouldn't even consume\ntwo glasses three times a week.\nHigh fat meals also upregulate aromatase.\nSo if you're on a ketogenic diet,\nbut you have hyperestrogenism,\nthen you should take\ncare with that as well.\n- All kinds of fats or\njust saturated fats?\n- I'm not sure if it's\njust saturated fats,\nbut fat definitely increases,\nboth fat and your body and consumption\nof a high amount of calories\nincreases aromatase.\n- So the it's the ratio of\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nI don't want to break your flow,\nbut since we're talking\nabout fat, I have to ask,\nsince estrogen and testosterone\nare both synthesized\nfrom the cholesterol molecule,\nI've heard that ingesting\nsome amount of saturated fat\ncan be useful because of\nthe way that cholesterol\ncan serve as a precursor\nto these molecules.\nNow I once said on a podcast\nthat I like butter so much\nthat I occasionally eat pats of butter.\nSomehow that got misinterpreted to mean\nthat I eat entire many pats of butter.\nI'm saying like one or two\npats of butter here and there,\nand I have no guilt or shame about it.\nMy blood lipids are in great\nshape also, so I feel good.\nBut is it possible that people\nwho are ingesting too\nlittle of saturated fats\ncould directly or indirectly reduce\nor somehow disrupt the\nproper ratio of testosterone\nto estrogen in men and women?\n- It's theoretically possible,\nbut it probably doesn't\nhappen in developed countries\njust like it's theoretically possible\nto have not enough omega-6 fatty acids,\nbut that probably does not\nhappen in developed countries.\n- So I don't need the butter pats,\nbut I'm going to do it anyway.\nI'm just curious.\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\n- Grass-fed butter has good\nomega-3 content as well.\nSo grass-fed foods in general.\nIt's not the end all be all\nand everybody doesn't\nneed grass-fed foods,\nbut they are one of the only\nsources of healthy trans fat.\nSo a naturally occurring trans\nfat comes from ruminants.\nSo ruminants, think of like cows and\nthe rumination in the different stomachs\ncan change your omega-3 and omega-6\nto trans-linolenic and\ntrans-linoleic fatty acids.\n- Which are healthy for us.\n- Yeah.\nSo it's actually omega-3s and omega-6s\nthat just happened to have a\ntrans instead of cis-isomer.\n- And these healthy\ntrans fats would be found\nin ruminant cheese and milk and butter\nfrom ruminants and the meat-\n- And the meat.\n- And the meats?\n- Yes.\n- And for people who are following\na purely plant-based diet\nor mostly plant-based diet,\nare they at risk of not\ngetting enough of certain types\nof fats or other nutrients to\nmaintain that healthy ratio\nof testosterone to estrogen or not?\n- If they're a vegetarian,\nthey're probably not at risk.\nIf they're a vegan, they\nvery well could be at risk.\nMost vegans are aware of this very acutely\nand they'll supplement with\nalgae or they'll supplement\nwith other sources\nof healthy fats.\n- I see, so the takeaway\nthat I'm drawing from this\nis that less so than\ngetting saturated fat,\nit's key to get these healthy\ntrans fats from ruminants.\n- [Kyle] Yes.\n- Or the food products of those ruminants\nas well as to get proper\namounts of omega-3s.\n- Yeah, and to be clear, you\ndon't need any trans fats.\nIt just happens that those\nomega-3s and omega-6s\nare in a trans-isomer.\n- I see, okay, so that's nutrition.\nWhat other supplements can\nsupport healthy testosterone\nto estrogen ratios?\n- Anything that alters aromatase\ncan support healthy\ntestosterone to estrogen.\nAnd your testosterone to estrogen ratio,\nthink about it as how\nmuch estrogen activity\ndo you have at the beta estradiol receptor\nand your alpha estradiol receptor.\n- How would I know that?\n- So [chuckles] it's hard to tell,\nbut depending on what you're eating,\nif you have a lot of plant-based\ndiets or polyphenols,\nmany of these are beta\nestradiol receptors.\nPeople know about Turkesterone\nand also Beta-Ecdysterone,\nwhich are two ecdysteroids\nthat are beta estradiol receptor agonist.\nSo they activate the\nbeta estradiol receptor.\nSo if you have a very low\namount of estrogen naturally,\nyou're probably a better candidate for it.\n- For taking Turkesterone or ecdysterone?\n- Yeah, ecdysterone.\n- I've never tried them,\nbut I know my understanding\nis that they work tremendously\nwell for some people.\n- Yeah.\n- And not at all for others.\nAnd so one just simply has to try.\nBut in promoting the activity\nof this estrogen receptor,\nis there a risk that\nTurkesterone or ecdysterone\ncould cause some of the\nquote/unquote problems associated\nwith increasing estrogen activity,\nlike reduced libido, water retention?\n- Water retention, yes.\nReduced libido, probably not.\nClosing growth plates in the bone, no,\nbecause that's the\nalpha-estradiol receptor.\n- I've talked before on a couple\nof podcasts about tongkat ali,\nwhich is Indonesian herb, I guess,\nis also made and found in Malaysia.\nBut it seems to be the\nIndonesian variety of tongkat ali\nthat's most effective for potentially\nfor reducing sex hormone\nand binding globulin\nand thereby freeing up testosterone.\nWhether or not the effects\nare through that pathway,\nthrough another pathway,\na lot of people report\nimprovements in things like libido\nand maybe androgen-like phenotypes, right?\nFeeling more vital, et cetera.\nAnd of course, some of that\ncould be placebo, correct?\nBut what are your thoughts on tongkat ali?\nAnd please challenge my\nstatements about tongkat ali\nif they're incorrect.\nI'm not looking for validation here.\nI just really want to know\nwhat your thoughts are on it.\nDo you ever recommend\nit to patients, when?\nMen, women, one or the other?\n- Yeah, so tongkat ali or longjack\nhas multiple mechanisms of action\nand there have been several\nplacebo controlled studies on it.\nSome of them show decrease in SHBG,\nat least one of them did\nnot show any change in SHBG.\nHowever, it does act on\naromatase very weakly.\nProbably not so strongly\nthat you would have\nto be concerned of hypoestrogenism.\n- So it reduces aromatase and thereby\ncan reduce estrogen.\n- Correct.\n- Okay.\n- It's also a weak, it's not SERM,\nso it's not a selective\nestrogen receptor modifier,\nbut it's probably a weak,\nit's probably an ERM as well\nor a non-selective\nestrogen receptor modifier.\nAnd that should help\nwith decreasing negative\nfeedback inhibition\nof estradiol in various locations\nand also increasing testosterone.\n- Interesting, yeah,\nthe dosage that I've been\nusing for years now is,\nit's 400 milligrams taken once a day,\ntypically early in the day,\n'cause it can kind of have\na mild stimulant effect, very mild.\nAnd I know that some of\nthe products out there\nrecommend dosages that are much higher.\nAnytime I've taken more than\n400, I don't feel very good.\nI don't know how to describe it other than\nit's just a little overly\nstimulatory in terms\nof makes me kind of,\nit's like drinking too much coffee.\n- [Kyle] Yeah.\n- So that's interesting.\nAnd so would women ever\nwant to take tongkat ali\nfor any reason?\n- Yeah, absolutely.\nSo there's a lot of women\nthat have hyperestrogenism\nand unlike adrenal fatigue or andropause,\nthere's actually ICD 10\ncodes for hypoestrogenism.\n- ICD 10 codes?\n- Yeah.\n- That's doctor speak, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\n- So there's codes\nto where your doctor\ncan actually diagnose you with something.\nSo if you go to your doctor and you say,\nI have adrenal fatigue, they\ncan't diagnose you with that.\nOr if you say I have andropause,\nthey also can't diagnose you with that.\nBut if you say you have hypoestrogenism,\nthe most common complaint\nthat comes with it\nis endometriosis, which is\novergrowth of the lining\nof the uterus.\nAnd those people could potentially,\nI think, that's one\narea where we might see\ntongkat supplementation more and more,\nbecause not only does\nit decrease aromatase.\nLike we mentioned,\ntestosterone in females is higher\nthan estrogen in females.\nSo a lot of females get estrogen\nfrom aromatization as well.\nPeripheral estrogen is\nsometimes what we call it,\nbecause it's not directly\nproduced in the ovaries.\nBut they could be good\ncandidates for tongkat\nif that's the case.\n- Very interesting and my understanding\nis that people should\nbe looking for sources\nof Indonesian tongkat ali in particular.\n- Correct.\n- Right.\n- Another interesting\napplication is essentially a,\nI'll call it a PCT,\nbut essentially-\n- What that means is?\n- PCT means, I'll defined\nit as post-cycle therapy.\n- Physicians love acronyms,\nscientists love acronyms,\nmilitary love acronym, but we, yeah.\nPCT, post cycle therapy, so\nthis would be people coming\noff hormone therapy or steroids.\n- This would actually be for\nwomen that are coming off\nof their birth control pill,\nbecause perhaps it can help\nlower that SHBG back to normal,\nwhich is sometimes persistently elevated,\nand then it can help prevent\nthe subsequent\nhypoestrogenism that happens.\n- Does tongkat ali need to be cycled?\nWhen I first started taking\nit, I would cycle it.\nI would do a few, three, four months,\nand I would take some time off.\nNow I've just been taking\nit continuously for years.\n- [Kyle] Yeah.\n- And I should say I do blood work\nto check my liver enzymes\nand everything else and\nI don't see any reason\nfor me to cease taking it.\n- Yeah. Probably not.\nThere's been human studies\non both tongkat and Fadogia.\nAnd full disclosure,\nI did help design Derek's new\ntestosterone optimization supplement,\nwhich has both Fadogia agrestis\nand also tongkat ali in it.\n- Yeah. Let's talk about\nFadogia separately in a moment.\nBut let's say someone is\nonly taking tongkat ali\nfor whatever reason, do\nthey need to cycle off?\n- Likely not, but I would just to be safe,\nbecause it does both affect your aromatase\nand it's an estrogen receptor modifier.\n- And what would be a\nreasonable cycle off?\nSo how long to take and how long to stop\nbefore taking it again?\n- Yeah, there's a couple\ndifferent protocols\nthat you can do,\nbut 11 months on, 1 month off for tongkat\nis pretty reasonable.\nNow I guess this is,\nwe'll talk about this later too,\nbut if it's combined with Fadogia,\nthe protocol that I would\ndo is three weeks on,\none week off.\n- So that's tongkat ali.\nBut I'm curious what your\nthoughts are on Fadogia agrestis,\nthis Nigerian shrub or this\nextract from Nigerian shrubs\nthat at least in my experience,\nin my read of the literature,\nhas the potential to increase testosterone\nand probably other hormones as well\nby way of increasing luteinizing hormone.\nSomething that we haven't\nreally talked about much\nup until now.\nWhat are your thoughts\nabout Fadogia agrestis?\nWhat are your ideas about\nthe proposed mechanism\nor mechanisms and where\nmight this be useful\nfor people on or off\nhormone replacement therapy?\n- Yeah, Fadogia agrestis\nhas just reached a point\nwhere we have enough evidence till we know\nit probably helps both with\nluteinizing hormone release,\nwhich stimulates Leydig\ncells in the testes\nto produce more testosterone.\nAnd probably with LH receptor sensitivity\nas well, which is a good\ncombination of the two.\nIt does come from the Nigerian shrub,\nbut there is not quite\nenough evidence for me\nto be able to say\nit's safe for someone to\ntake this all the time,\nwhich again, full disclosure,\nthat's why I recommended that we\nrecommended for people\nto cycle this supplement.\nSo three weeks on, one week\noff, that's likely safe.\nThe only toxicity studies in general are\nin rats and in humans,\nit looks quite safe.\n- My understanding is\nthat the toxicity studies\nin rats showed toxicity\nto the testicular cells,\nso that's certainly concerning,\nbut that the dosages that\nwere used or translating\nthe dosages used to humans would lead\nto a situation where\nthe dosages that humans\nwould have to take would\nbe very, very large.\nSo the amount of, I no\nlonger take Fadogia,\nbut I took it at 600 milligrams\nper day for a long time.\nAnd I ceased taking it\nbecause I was experimenting\nwith other things and I didn't\nwant to confound those things.\nNot because I had any\nnegative side effects.\nIn fact, I was monitoring blood work,\nand other biological parameters\nthat would've told me\nif there was testicular\ntoxicity, and there wasn't.\nLet's put it that way.\n- Yeah. I think it's extremely safe.\nAnd I'm just not convinced\nthat there's enough overwhelming evidence\nfor longterm consistent administration.\n- So do you recommend this to\npeople who are not taking TRT\nand do you recommend to men and women?\n- Yeah, so if you have a really high LH,\nthen there's probably a gonadal issue,\nwhether it's heat damage to\nthe testes, a varicocele,\na history of testicular cancer\nwhere your LH is going to be higher.\nSo if your LH is already very high,\nincreasing it even more is\nprobably not going to help.\nHowever, if your LH is low,\nthen obviously try to find out is it low?\nIs it deficient or is it\njust a little bit low?\nIf it's low and you don't\nhave an issue with prolactin,\nyou don't have an issue with\nopioid receptor antagonism,\nand naltrexone can actually\npotentially help antagonize\nthat to increase LH as well,\nespecially in people\nrecovering from opiates\nor likely even alcohol.\nSo you're looking for a\nsubclinical secondary hypogonadism,\nwhich is essentially, just\nthink of that as low LH.\nSo in people with that lower\nLH and their estrogen is fine\nand their prolactin is fine,\nthen Fadogia is a\nparticularly good option.\n- Interesting, so three weeks on,\none week off for 600 milligrams Fadogia,\n400 milligrams tongkat\nali, Indonesian tongkat ali\ncould potentially you be good.\nAnd of course, everyone\nshould always check\nwith their physician,\nclear this, do blood work, et cetera.\nI always say we don't just\nsay that to protect us.\nWe say that to protect\nyou, meaning the consumer.\nAnd it's very, very important.\nYou don't want to get,\nyou don't want to fly blind\nwith any of the stuff.\nYou want to do blood work, right?\n- That's the catch-22 with supplements\nis most of them are\nsafer than medications,\nbut the only difference\nbetween them and a medication\nis one's prescribed and one's not.\n- And oftentimes with supplements,\nit's unclear whether or not\nwhat's listed on the bottle\nis actually what's in the bottle but.\n- Yeah.\n- But I think there are a\nnumber of reputable brands now.\nThe other supplement I want to talk about\nin terms of testosterone\naugmentation is boron.\nWhat is boron thought to do?\nDoes it actually do that?\nAnd do you ever recommend boron?\n- Yeah, so boron is actually an element.\nAnd you can find it on the periodic table.\nIt's more plentiful in rich soils.\nSo frequent farming can\ndeplete the soils of boron.\nIt's very plentiful in\nthe Mediterranean area\nlike Greece and Turkey,\nso a lot of people will\njust eat dates or raisins\nthat are grown there.\n- I thought you were going\nto tell me people eat dirt,\nbut there are people\nwho eat dirt.\n- There are people\nwho eat dirt.\n- And there's a phenomenon\ncalled pica, right?\nWhere people in a, and that's\nnot a good thing, they-\n- Often assign a iron deficiency.\n- Okay, but they're\neating grapes and dates\nthat were grown in soil that\nhas high amounts of boron.\nIs that right?\n- Yeah.\nYep, so boron can help regulate SHBG,\nbut its effect is mostly acute.\nSo it's unlikely to have a bad effect,\nso a lot of people take boron\nbecause it's probably not going to hurt\nand it will lower SHBG even if it\nis for a short period of time.\nSo I guess you could make a\ncase that maybe cycling boron\ncan help too.\n- What sorts of dosages\nare useful for boron supplementation?\n- Three to six milligrams\nonce to twice a day.\n- Oh, interesting, so that's\nhigher than the amounts\nthat I've been taking.\nI've long been doing this\ncocktail of tongkat ali,\nagain, I stopped taking Fadogia,\nbut for a long time\nwith Fadogia, and boron,\nI think it was two to\nfour milligrams per day,\nbut maybe I could afford to go higher.\nAlthough my blood work is\nwhere I want it, thankfully.\nSo circling back to Fadogia.\nFadogia was attractive\nto me as a supplement,\nbecause I saw increases\nin LH, testosterone,\nand free testosterone.\nMy estrogen stayed in check,\nbut I also did not see\na down-regulation of LH\nwhen I would cycle off.\nWhereas with hCG, human\nchorionic gonadotropin,\nwhich does now arrive\nin forms not from pregnant\nwomen's urine only,\nbut the synthetic forms\nthat people inject,\nthat, as I understand,\nit can actually suppress\nendogenous hormone output\nif one takes it for a long period of time.\nSo why would a man or\nwoman want to take hCG?\nAnd what are the potential risks\nand benefits of taking hCG?\n- Yeah, so hCG or human\nchorionic gonadotropin\nis actually very similar to TSH.\n- Thyroid stimulating hormone?\n- Correct, so when a woman is pregnant,\nshe produces more hCG,\nespecially in the first trimester.\nWhen you take a pregnancy test,\nwhether it's qualitative or quantitative,\nyou see the hCG rise,\nand it actually doubles every 48 hours.\nSo if you're five weeks pregnant,\nyou can get a hCG level.\nAnd then two days later,\nfive weeks and two days,\nyou can see your hCG,\nand maybe it went from 500 to 1,000.\nSo it precipitously increases.\nIt does a few things.\nOne thing is it prevents hypothyroidism\nor hypothyroxinemia of pregnancy,\nwhich is one of the most\ncommon causes of miscarriage.\nIt's also why if you are,\nif you have hypothyroidism\nand you get pregnant\nin the first trimester,\nyou want to increase\nyour dose from 25 to 40%\nto keep your free T4\nhigh as much as possible.\nAnd the reason why you have to do that\nas opposed to somebody who\ndoes not have hypothyroidism,\nis if you have hypothyroidism,\nthen likely your thyroid will not respond\nto either TSH or hCG.\nSo the increased hCG does\nnot compensate for that.\nSo if you take hCG,\nthen it can potentially\nimprove your thyroid function.\nSo that along with selenium\nare likely the two best things\nthat you can do for thyroid health.\n- hCG and selenium?\n- Yeah.\n- Well, I definitely make\nsure I get enough selenium\nby eating three to five\nBrazil nuts per day.\n- Yeah.\n- Which I very much enjoy\nthe taste of also.\nWho should take hCG and can hCG suppress\none's normal luteinizing hormone output?\n- Yeah, it suppresses LH\nin a dose-dependent manner.\nSo the higher the dose of hCG you take,\nthe more it suppresses LH.\nA common dose for fertility,\nfertility is usually\nwhy hCG is prescribed.\n- In men or women?\n- In both, is 10,000 IUs\nall at one time, which is quite a bit.\n- That's a tremendous dose.\n- Yeah, in fact, some formulations,\nsome brand names of hCG\ncome in autoinjector pins\nto where you cannot even\ndose lower than 5,000 units\nat a time.\n- Wow.\n- Yeah.\n- But I know a number\nof people who take hCG\nto maintain testicular function while\non testosterone therapy or\naugmentation of some sort.\nDoes it work to do that?\n- Yeah, some people\nare on hCG monotherapy.\nIt can be slightly better on your lipids\nthan being on TRT.\n- Oh, so people are using hCG alone\nas a kind of\nneither sort of a indirect\nhormone augmentation.\n- Yeah.\nSome clinics advertise it as\na non-suppressive alternative\nto TRT, but it is suppressive of LH.\n- But it could also increase\nestrogen pretty potently?\n- Yeah.\n- And is it true that\nincreasing LH and/or hCG\ncan improve sensitivity of the genitals?\nAnd is that true for men and women?\nYeah, I've heard this anecdotally.\nPeople say hCG makes sexual\nactivity more pleasurable\nfor people because of some,\nis it a direct effect on some\nof the nerve cells in the genitals?\n- Yeah, so LH is also an\nagonist in the prostate\nand in genital tissue in general.\nSo it's a very common treatment\nfor post-finasteride syndrome\nor post-5-alpha reductase\nwhen you've blocked the conversion of DHT\nfor a long time, it\nhelps re-upregulate DHT.\n- So someone who's been taking finasteride\nto prevent hair loss, comes off it,\nmaybe 'cause they felt lousy,\nbut then feels even lousier for reasons\nthat you talked about earlier.\nAnd then they might use hCG\nas a transition treatment\nto transition back to\nnormal hormone health.\nIs that right?\n- Yeah.\n- It's extremely helpful in many cases.\nNow when you come off the hCG,\nthen you need to have a\nstrategy of how to return\nto your normal as fast\nas possible as well.\nBut it will upregulate those\n5-alpha reductase enzymes.\nYou have, in your genital skin,\nboth scrotal skin and penile\nskin, and perineum in general,\nyou have, I believe what's\ncalled stratum lucidum.\nIt's skin layer that is very, very thin,\nbut it has the highest\nconcentration of 5-alpha reductase.\nSo you have a lot of activity.\nAnd after you've been on something\nthat inhibits the enzyme,\nthe 5-AR enzyme in those tissues,\nthen you do something else\nto upregulate those enzymes,\nwhether it's waiting and taking time,\nwhether it's trying tadalafil,\nwhether it's trying creatine even,\nor whether it's trying HCG,\na lot of times those are the go-tos\nfor post-finasteride syndrome.\n- Any risks for women\ntaking HCG on their ability\nto get pregnant or risks generally?\n- Yeah, obviously it'll make\nany pregnancy test positive.\nSo that's a risk that\nsome women don't know.\n- So one could, in theory,\nfake a pregnancy test\nby injecting hCG.\n- Absolutely.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah.\n- I have no motivation to do that.\nI was just curious.\n[Kyle chuckles]\n- Yeah.\n- What about prolactin?\nThe simple version of\nthis that I was taught,\nbecause I was taught mainly\nfrom the neuroendocrine perspective was\ndopamine is a kind of close\ncousin of testosterone,\nand also estrogen for that matter,\ndrives appetitive behaviors,\nincluding pursuit of sexual\npartners, sex itself,\nmotivated behaviors generally,\nthen postcopulatory, post-orgasmic states\nare accompanied by a prolactin increase.\nThat's the refractory\nperiod for mating in males,\nand maybe even in females as well,\ninvolved in milk letdown, et cetera.\nWhat are sort of\nthe general contours of syndromes\nor things that people\ncould be on the lookout for\nof having too much prolactin\nor too little prolactin?\nAnd I'm aware of a number of people\nwho take dopamine agonists,\nL-tyrosine, cabergoline,\nthings like that, to really\nboost their dopamine levels.\nAnd that isn't always a\ngood thing as it turns out.\nOftentimes people become\nkind of hyper-dopaminergic\nand so they have the drive\nto do all these appetitive\nthings, fill in the blanks,\nbut they don't always have the ability,\nbecause it seems,\njust as testosterone\nand estrogen need to be\nin the proper ratios,\ndopamine and prolactin need to\nbe in the appropriate ratios.\nSo how should we think about\nand perhaps act on our prolactin systems?\n- Absolutely, the way I describe it\nis the dopamine wave pool.\nSo if you're increasing\nyour dopamine too much,\nyou're going to overflow and\nthen you're going to have\nthat wave crash too much.\nSo you want to have nice even waves\nthat are not going too far above the pool\nof dopamine and prolactin will follow.\nSo prolactin and estrogen\nare quite close cousins.\nEstrogen upregulates a\ngene called the PRL gene\nor prolactin gene\nthat directly increases\nprolactin synthesis.\nSo prolactin is going to also inhibit\nthe release of testosterone\nfrom the pituitary.\nSo if you're using a dopamine agonist,\nthen you're to help decrease\nthe prolactin-producing cells,\nincluding if you have a\nprolactin-producing microadenoma\nin the pituitary.\n- How common are those?\nBecause, I mean, I hear a lot\nabout these hypogonadism or,\nand of course that can be due\nto an issue at the testicles\nor hypergonadism could\nalso be of course in like\novarian syndromes and\nthen there's of course\nthe brain side of it\nwhere the signals aren't\ncoming from the brain.\nNot enough gonadotropin, not\nenough luteinizing hormone.\nAnd there are ways of teasing this apart\nwith an endocrinologist\nthat are quite elegant\nin fact, right?\nUsing stimulating hormones,\ntoo much to dive into here.\nBut how often does one actually\nhave one of these pituitary tumors?\nI have heard that people that play a lot\nof high contact sport,\nso boxing, football,\npeople that headed the\nsoccer ball quite a lot,\nsadly people whose jobs force\nthem to take head blows for,\ncould be military.\nAnd so they were firing 50 caliber guns\nand the kind of woodpeckering of the brain\ninside of the skull.\nAnd construction workers\nor just a concussion\ncan cause the pituitary\nto go malfunctional.\nIs that really common or\nis this something that\nis a rare like 1%?\n- Yeah, it's extremely common.\nIt's another one of those conditions where\na lot of people never know they have it.\nThey just feel a little bit more fatigued.\nThey have that high prolactin\nfeeling all the time.\nPituitary microadenomas can\nbe non-producing as well.\nSo your prolactin can be totally normal.\nYour growth hormone and\nIGF-1 can be totally normal.\nThat's the second most common\nproducing microadenoma,\nis growth hormone causing\neither acromegaly,\nwhich is growth of cartilage or gigantism.\n- This is the big brow.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- So those are fairly\ncommon causes of adenomas,\nbut a lot of people that\nhave a very small adenoma,\nmuch less than one centimeter,\nit's hard to see on imaging\neven if you have a contrast\nthat specifically looks\nat the pituitary and many\npeople aren't symptomatic.\nSo it's one of those\nthings along with PCOS\nand pre-diabetes that\nare much more frequent\nwhen it comes to prevalence,\nwhich is the amount,\nthe percentage of people that have it\nin the general population.\n- I'm glad you mentioned\nthe dopamine wave pool.\nI know nowadays there's a lot of interest\nin augmenting dopamine.\nI know a number of people that do this\nthrough prescription drugs,\nAdderall, Ritalin, modafinil,\nand those drugs of course\nhit many transmitter systems,\nbut dopamine is certainly involved.\nPeople taking antidepressants\nlike Wellbutrin tap\ninto that system.\nAnd of course people are\ntrying to inhibit prolactin\nand promote serotonin or reduce serotonin.\nTo me, it all seems like a\nvery delicate dance, right?\nI mean, to just imagine the a arousal arc\nfor mating behavior,\nfor sexual reproduction,\nis such an in an elaborate\ndance between sympathetic drive\nand parasympathetic drive,\neven with across the\nspan of minutes, right?\nI mean, I've talked about\nthis before on the podcast\nthat the arousal is kind\nof more parasympathetic,\norgasm in itself is a\nsympathetic response,\na completely different set of neurons.\nAnd so where do you see\npeople getting into trouble\njust trying to hit the\ngas pedal on dopamine\nand where do you think there is a place\nfor people who perhaps\nare experiencing low drive\nand motivation, not just\nsexual, but in general,\nto increase the amount\nof dopamine circulating\nin their brain and body?\nHow do you think about that,\ngiven this wave pool analogy?\n- Yeah, so it's important to parse it out\nand start with the least\npowerful interventions.\nSo if someone's concerned about dopamine\nor maybe they have a\nslightly higher prolactin,\nthen they eliminate things\nthat could be increasing that prolactin.\n- Such as?\n- Casein or gluten,\nwhich are mu opioid receptor agonists\nor any mu opioid receptor\nagonist in the gut.\n- Casein, so milk protein?\n- Correct.\n- Can increase prolactin?\n- Correct.\n- Interesting.\n- In addition to that,\nthey should, if they need a pituitary MRI,\nthen they should get a pituitary MRI.\nIf they don't have an adenoma\nor if they don't have a\nhigh enough prolactin level\nto where they need an MRI,\nif they're having visual symptoms,\nor if they're having olfactory\nsymptoms with the nose,\nthen it's more likely that they do.\nBut if they don't,\na lot of times a prolactin under about 40\nis not too big of a deal.\nThey can take dopamine agonist\nthat agonize that D2 receptor\nlike P5P, which is essentially vitamin B6.\nIt's pyridoxine-5-pyrophosphate.\nAnd pyridoxine is vitamin B6.\nSo that can help, 50\nmilligrams once to twice a day.\nVitamin E can also help,\nespecially if it's mixed to tocopherols.\nA lot of people have\nhigh levels of vitamin E,\nbut low levels of the\ngamma form of vitamin E.\nSo that can also help.\n- Fascinating, I'm so glad you\nmentioned vitamin B6 and P5P.\nI have heard\nthat one can shorten the refractory period\nafter orgasm, essentially to\nbe able to have sex again,\nto be quite direct about it,\nby way of vitamin B6 blunting\nof the prolactin response,\nwhich turns out to quite potent.\nBut I've also heard that\nvitamin B6 can be neurotoxic,\nespecially in the periphery,\nthat it can cause peripheral neuropathies\nif it's taken at high doses.\nBut that P5P is the safer form.\nIs that true?\n- It's pre-activated,\nso it does not build up.\nThink of it as a allegory\nto how folate can build up.\nIt's not methyl folate,\nbut it builds up and it can\nincrease levels of homocystine.\nOr if you have too much vitamin B12,\nanother water soluble B vitamin,\nyou can have too much\nmethylmalonic acid or MMA.\nSo depending on what your\nenzymatic conversion is\nto the active form of the enzyme,\noften it's just safer to take\nthe active form of the enzyme.\n- Yeah. Very interesting.\n- Yeah.\n- Okay, well, at risk of going\ndown every hormonal pathway\nand talking about supplementation,\nlifestyle factors,\nI think touching on, as we have,\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nand now prolactin,\nI'd love to chat a little\nbit about L-carnitine.\nWe talked about this earlier,\nbut I want to raise this\ndiscussion about L-carnitine,\nnot in the context of L-carnitine itself,\nbut in the context of fertility.\nBecause my read of the\nliterature is that L-carnitine\ncan be very beneficial for\nenhancing sperm quality\nand egg quality and even\nrates of conception.\nWhat forms does L-carnitine come in\nthat people can reasonably consider?\nAgain, talk to your doctor, folks.\nWhat is it doing?\nAnd do we know how it's doing it?\nAnd do you often use\nthis in your patients?\n- Yeah, so the way I\nthink about L-carnitine,\nand I'll try to tie this in with creatine,\nand other things as well,\nis if your cell is an\nenergy factory or car,\nthen L-carnitine is the\nshuttle that helps get the fuel\ninto the motor to use the motor.\nThe motor is mostly due\nto lifestyle factors.\nSo like your diet and your exercise.\nAnd the type of fuel itself is NAD+.\nWe don't need to get into\nNAD precursors or NMN\nor NR, anything.\nAnd then the accessory fuel\ntank is your creatine phosphate.\nSo creatine is your accessory fuel tank.\nYour NAD status,\nwhich is largely determined\nby your REM sleep\nand quality sleep and exercise along\nwith supplementation as the fuel,\nthe carnitine shuttle is\ncarnitine palmitoyl coenzyme A.\nAnd that takes medium-chain fatty acids,\nit takes different molecules of fat.\nYou have two main energy\nsources other than ketones.\nYou have your glucose or carbs.\nYou have your fat or fatty acids.\nAnd that takes it across the\nlayer of the mitochondria\nso that it can be utilized.\nSo upregulates that,\nthat's why things that\nhave flagella in general,\nthe flagella are going to\nwork better, like sperm.\n- The flagella being anything,\nsort of the wavy little\ntenders on cell types\nof which they're everywhere, right?\nIn the gut too, right, yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- So those are going to\nwork significantly better.\nAnd in general, you're mitochondria\nare going to work better.\nSo the worst your\nmitochondria are off the bat,\nthe better they're going to\nbe helped by these shuttle\nthat shuttles them across.\nIt also slightly increases the density\nof the androgen receptor as well.\n- Is that a local effect?\nSo if an L-carnitine is injected\ninto a particular muscle,\nwill it increase the density\nof androgen receptors\nin that muscle?\n- Likely so.\n- So how are people taking L-carnitine?\nThere are capsule forms and\nthere are injectable forms.\nMost people are going to be\ntaking the capsule forms,\nbecause that's all they're\ngoing to have access to.\nAnd then we should also ask,\ncan you get L-carnitine from food?\n- Yeah, so L-carnitine\nis just a combination of,\nit's actually a very small peptide.\nSo glutathione is just\na three amino acids.\nL-carnitine is the smallest peptide, two.\nSo peptide is just a\nprotein that has amino acids\nbetween two and about 200.\nAnd L-carnitine is just two amino acids.\n- Amazing, so it's like a micro-peptide?\n- Yeah, so your body synthesizes enough.\nIt likes to absorb the\namino acids by themselves.\nAnd then if it puts them together,\nthere it makes L-carnitine.\nIt's not very bioavailable if you take it.\nA lot of people take\nL-carnitine, L-tartrate,\nor a acetyl-L-carnitine,\nand that's about 10% bioavailable.\nSo if you want 1 gram or 1,000 milligrams\nof L-carnitine, you can take\n10 grams of oral L-carnitine.\n- Is the one gram the typical dose,\nyou recommend one gram per day?\n- For fertility and androgen\nreceptor upregulation.\n- So that means taking 10\ngrams of the capsule form?\n- Yeah. So it's about 15 to\n20 capsules, which is a lot.\n- [Andrew] That is a lot.\n- It can also potentially increase TMAO.\n- Yeah, I want to ask about that,\nbecause TMAO on your blood chart is,\nwhen that's elevated,\nthat's going to cause some concern.\nYou taught me a trick,\nhowever, that one can take 600\nmilligrams of garlic capsule\nfor the allicin.\nIs that what it's called?\n- Allicin is in it, yeah.\n- It's like the name\nAllison but with two L's?\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\nAnd that had a remarkable\neffect in reducing TMAO.\nSo that's quite potent and also\nwas it just coincidence that\nit really brought my LDL down as well?\n- I'm not sure if the\nLDL is a coincidence,\nbut depending on your gut\nmicrobiome or your microbiota,\nsome microbiome beneficial bacteria\nwill convert carnitine and also choline.\nSo any choline precursor like Alpha-GPC\nor phosphatidylserine,\nit'll will convert them\nmore or less to TMAO.\nSo TMAO is something\nthat you can get measured\nin a blood test and see\nif it's high or low.\nSome people might not even need allicin.\n- Interesting.\n- Some people\ndo benefit from it.\n- Interesting, although I think it was you\nthat also told me\nthat allicin in garlic\ncan have positive effects\non cardiovascular tone\nand blood flow generally.\nIs that right?\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\nSo is 600 milligrams\ngarlic an excessive amount\nor can I just eat garlic?\n- You can just eat-\n- I mean,\nI like eating garlic.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\nSo, okay, so one could\nalso just eat garlic.\nIf one were going to take\nL-carnitine in injectable form,\nhow much of that is bioavailable?\n- 100% if you inject it.\nIt is in a aqueous solution,\nso it's bacteria static water essentially.\nSo it's not in a carrier oil.\nSo it's going to burn a lot if\nyou inject it subcutaneously.\nSo it's going to be absorbed\nfaster and more evenly\nand also just hurt a lot\nless if you inject it\ninto a muscle.\n- But one could then just\ntake one gram per day injected\nor divide it up into a couple doses?\n- Yeah, or 500,\nthe minimally efficacious\ndose for injectable's probably\naround 200 when it\ncomes to sperm motility,\nthe androgen receptor upregulation.\nSo it really depends on\nwhy you're taking it.\n- In terms of fertility,\nand in terms of blood tests generally,\nI always say that if possible,\neither by way of insurance\nor by way of some other way,\naffording it, it would be great for people\nto have blood tests\nto know what their hormone\nlevels and other levels\nof other things like metabolic\nmarkers and lipids were\nin their 20s, also in their\n30s, also in their 40s.\nI think there's this idea that\nyou only take a blood test\nwhen you have a problem,\nbut then of course\none can't actually do the comparison\nthat you mentioned earlier\nor state the comparison to one's physician\nthat things are changing over time.\nAnd it seems to me that\nbasically everyone should get\nat least a once-a-year blood test.\nIs there the hope that insurance\nwill someday just cover it for everybody?\nThis will be standard care?\nI would think that everybody\nshould know what sorts\nof things are floating\naround in their bloodstream\nand what they need more\nof and less of in life.\n- I doubt it will ever\nbe covered by insurance.\nIn many cases,\nyou could make an argument\nthat it's indicated.\nAs insurance begins to cover more\nof the population for pathologies,\nthe things like FSAs\nor HSAs or care credit\nwill likely cover this advanced testing,\nwhich it continues to come\ndown and down in price.\nSo it'll be affordable,\nbut it won't be free.\n- Got it. Yeah.\nI'd like to shift gears slightly\nand talk about social interactions\nand relational effects on hormones.\nSomething that I just find fascinating.\nWe touched on this a little bit earlier\nin terms of oral contraception,\nbut now that we have the backdrop\nof what these various hormones do,\nsome involvement in neurotransmitter\nsystems like dopamine\nand pro prolactin and associated pathways.\nProlactin of course being a\nhormone. Not a neurotransmitter.\nBut there's a phenomenon\nin human beings where people\nget very excited about\na new partner and\nthat excitement no doubt is related\nto the dopamine system\namong other systems.\nAnd that excitement can be\nmaintained or can wane over time.\nAnd here I'm talking about attraction,\nbut I'm also talking about\njust general excitement\nin the sense of novelty,\nbecause that's what\ndopamine's associated with.\nGiven that you work with human beings\nand they have lives and\nrelationships and lifestyles,\nand they have hormones, and\nall these things interact,\nwhat are some of the ways\nthat we could think about\nadjusting our relationships\nin order to optimize hormones\nas opposed to just thinking\nabout how to optimize hormones\nfor sake of our relationship?\nBecause it's bidirectional of course.\nAnd this assumes, I should say,\nthat one is already paying attention\nto the six pillars talked about earlier,\nthat people are doing most things right.\nHow should we think about\nrelationships in hormones:\nfriendships, romantic relationships,\nnew partners, longterm partners,\nyeah, how do you think\nabout this kind of stuff?\n- Yeah, so if you have a new partner,\nthen it is largely regulated\nby the dopaminergic system,\nwhich changes over time.\nSo people may have heard\nthe saying that you have\nto go through a full calendar year\nwith someone that you're in a relationship\nso that you-\n- Very good advice,\nby the way.\n- So that\nyou really know what to\ndo and what not to do.\nBut because you experience\nboth of your families\nin the holidays and all\nthe different situations.\nBut I would argue until\nyou have moved in together,\nhad a baby,\nand then raised that baby,\npreferably breastfeeding,\nbecause that's when you\nget the prolactin spikes,\nyou haven't really gone through\nevery stage in life yet.\nNow you can't really do\nthat with every person\nthat you're considering.\n- Well, some people do,\nbut it can be quite\ncostly in terms of time\nand finances and emotionally costly.\n- Yeah.\n- And then here, I'm\ndefinitely not referring to\nany personal experience\nof having done all that many times over,\nbut what would you suggest people\ndo or think about as they\nenter a relationship or\nfor people that are in\nlongterm relationships\nwhere they feel like\nsomething has shifted,\nand indeed those shifts\nmay reflect the output\nof different hormone systems\nand neurotransmitter systems.\nIt almost certainly has\nto be the case, right?\n- Yeah, so just like women who\nspend a lot of time together,\nwhether they're coworkers or whatever,\na lot of times their\nmenstrual cycles will align.\nThere is a lot of pheromonal\nand hormonal crosstalk,\nincluding prolactin between men and women.\nSo spending 100% of the time together,\nthis is why people think\nit's so hard to work together\nand live together.\nThey're around each other 24/7.\nYou don't have the reprieve where you let\nthat dopamine settle down,\nand then you're excited\nwhen you see them again.\nA lot of guys know that if they've gone on\na hunting trip or if they've\ngone on a trip for a long time,\nthey come back and they see their partner,\nand it's like a new, not\nquite like a new relationship,\nbut almost like a new relationship.\nAnd they have that excitement again.\nAnd purposely building that\ninto every relationship\ncan help significantly,\nespecially if you choose to\nhave a child or get pregnant\nor be breastfeeding,\nbecause you just plan ahead\nfor both of your prolactins\nto be high and both of\nyour dopamines to be low.\nAnd both of your testosterones to be low.\nSo there's a lot of\nplanning that you can do.\nEssentially every relationship\ngoes through a crisis.\nAnd that crisis is personal\nbetween the two of you.\nAnd you can plan ahead and\nfigure out a way, maybe\nit's not supplementation.\nMaybe it's not even the\namount of time you spend away\nfrom each other.\nBut plan ahead to have good times\nif you know you're about\nto go into a crisis.\n- Got it, and so it sounds like time apart\nand time together,\nwhich is actually built\ninto a number of cultures\nwhere men and women\nwill purposefully avoid each\nother for some period of time,\navoid physical touch\nand maybe in proximity,\nand then will reconvene,\nand yet those are very stable\nrelationships over time often.\nIs the inverse also true?\nFor instance, for people that are\nin long distance relationships,\nwhere they're only seeing each other three\nor four days a week or two days a week,\ndoes this explain the fact that\nsome of those relationships\ncan go on for a very long period of time\nwithout ever actually entering the,\nlet's call it the hyper-prolactin phase\nof actually moving in together\nand et cetera, et cetera.\nLike in other words,\nis that a way in which people are spiking\nand troughing dopamine\nthat keeps them attached?\nThis kind of elusive,\nthis sort of, what is it called?\nI think it's called like a cat string.\nLike if you play with a cat\nand you move the string away,\nthey'll keep reaching,\nbut you throw the string on\nthe ground, they're like,\nthey're totally uninterested in it.\nIs that what's going on?\n'Cause that's a dopaminergic phenomenon,\nthe cat string example.\nWe know this experimentally.\n- In those cases, the relationship\nhasn't really progressed,\nin many of those cases,\npast the dopamine spike,\nthe fun initial stage, honeymoon stage,\nwhatever you want to call it.\nSo it's almost kind of like a roommate.\nIf you're looking for a roommate,\nif it was for college or\nafter college or whatever,\nyou can fill out forms and\nlook for common interests,\nbut until you're actually together\na significant proportion of the time,\nyou're not really going to know\nif you're going to be compatible or not.\n- And is there evidence\nthat the appearance\nof an infant changes,\nobviously there're going\nto be hormonal shifts.\nWe know actually that for\nin both women and in men,\nthere's a prolactin increase\nwhen couples are expecting a child.\nIt's almost like a brooding phenomenon.\nYou see this in birds where\nit's actually called brooding\nand it's caused by prolactin increase,\nbut it turns out this\nalso occurs in humans.\nAnd some people would argue this causes\nthe dad bod phenomenon,\n'cause it actually,\nprolactin is involved in\nlaying down a body fat,\npreparing for sleepless nights.\nAnd presumably that spike\nin prolactin is there also\nto suppress sexual activity,\nbecause there are periods\nof time immediately\nnear childbirth where sexual\nactivity is not advantageous.\n- Yeah, you see a prolactin\nspike right after breastfeeding.\nSo if you think about it,\noften when you have an infant,\nyou'll breastfeed, put the infant to bed,\nand then immediately go\nto bed with your partner,\nwhich is not particularly conducive.\nIt's almost like trying to\nhave intercourse back to back.\nAnd it's very difficult.\n- Because of in the prolactin sense?\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- Low dopamine, high prolactin.\nOxytocin is also increased significantly\nto help with milk let-down as well.\nSo yeah, as far as brooding,\nthere's definitely a human\nequivalent of brooding.\nSome humans call it nesting\ninstinct, which is both helpful,\nbut it's not necessarily a\nbad change in a relationship.\nIt's just a change.\nAnd as long as you know that it's coming,\nyou're going to do better with it.\nJust like any medication.\nIf you are aware of the side effect\nand that it might happen,\nthen when it happens, it's not only\nless severe, it also happens less often.\n- Very interesting.\n- If you tell the patient.\n- Well as a neuroscientist,\nI come from the framework that\nof course hormones impact\nperception and behavior,\nbut perception and behavior\nalso impact hormones.\nI find this fascinating.\nI also really like the example you gave\nof people taking time apart,\nbut also these affiliative bonds\nthat are non-romantic bonds\ncan serve as kind of\na reservoir to replenish dopamine that\nis then released upon\nexperience going back\nto one's partner or some sort\nof regular feature of home.\nVery interesting, and of\ncourse this should exist\non both sides.\nI'm guessing that from both\nthe male side and female side,\nthere's an interest in kind\nof separation and reunion\nas the theme.\nAnd I guess the frequency will vary for\ndifferent couples and\ndifferent situations.\n- Yeah, and I don't want to\nmake it seem like prolactin\nis all bad, so prolactin does help\nwith the nesting instinct.\nIt helps with breastfeeding as well.\nA lot of women are diagnosed\nwith luteal phase defects,\nwhich is basically the\nphase after ovulation,\nbut before a period or giving birth.\nA pregnancy's kind of a\nprolonged luteal phase.\nAnd a lot of them will go\non progesterone for this.\nProgesterone can also decrease\nprolactin and prolactin\nis also helpful for the\nmaturity of lungs in infants.\nSo it helps the sphingomyelin\nto lecithin ratio.\nSo if your prolactin's\ntoo low through pregnancy,\nit spikes up very high during pregnancy,\nthen it can lead to increased risk\nof respiratory distress of the newborn.\n- Really interesting. Yeah.\nSo we certainly don't\nwant to paint a picture\nwhere prolactin is the\nbad hormone to avoid.\nWithout proactive, none of\nus would be here of course.\nIt's so vital.\nI realized that earlier I raised\nthe question about whether\nor not cold exposure could\nmodify hormone output,\nin particular whether or\nnot ice baths or ice applied\nto specific tissues of the\nbody, as people are doing,\none way or the other,\ncan change testosterone\nlevels, estrogen levels.\nIn other words, does taking\nice baths and cold showers\nincrease testosterone and/or estrogen?\n- Yeah, so taking a ice\nbath or a cold shower\nor cold exposure in general,\nit's not going to correct\na vitamin D deficiency\nor a metabolic syndrome.\nSo there's a lot of things\nthat it will not correct\nthat are causes of hypogonadism\nor low testosterone,\nbut it will help acutely,\nspecifically the application of cold\nto testes that are too warm.\nSo if you have a varicocele\nor if you have a little bit\nof a primary hypogonadism,\nwhich is where testosterone\nis not released by the testes,\nbut your LH and FSH signals\nare sufficiently high,\nthen you'll likely respond\nto cold exposure better.\nAnd there's actually undergarments that\nare designed specifically\nto help with fertility.\nAnd there's probably going\nto be more and more of that\nin the future.\nYou just need to be careful\nnot to get frost bite,\nbecause it's a particularly\nbad spot to get frost bite.\n- Noted. Could you define varicocele?\nYou've mentioned it a few times.\nThat's a varicose vein?\n- Yeah, so it's essentially\na varicose vein.\nIt brings warm blood and the venous flow\nor the flow back to the\nheart is not as good.\nJust like in the legs, it\ncan happen in the scrotum.\nUsually about 20 to 25% of people\nhave one grade of varicocele.\nThere's grades one through\nfour, one through five.\nAnd most people just have a very mild one,\nusually on the left side\nbecause the blood has\nto go through further to\nget back to the heart.\nAnd it raises the\ntemperature of the testes.\nTemperature is the enemy of testes.\nSo they like to be 5 to 10 degrees cooler\nthan the rest of the body.\n- So are saunas particularly\nbad for sperm production?\n- They can be, yeah.\n- When you say can be, I mean,\nhow long could one safely be in the sauna,\nor would you want to go\nback and forth between\nthe cold and sauna?\nAre there any data?\n- If someone is having infertility,\nthen I tell them to avoid\nall saunas empirically.\nIf someone has, if they're not infertile,\nbut they have a low sperm count,\nI also tell them to avoid.\nHowever, it's mostly warmed water\nthat can raise the temperature\nof the testes faster\nthan the sauna.\n- So hot tubs and things of that sort?\n- Yeah, so hot tub and a jacuzzi.\nThose are enemies number\none and number two of sperm.\n- What about ice baths and\ncold showers for women?\nAny evidence that it can\nshift hormone output in women?\n- Yeah, it can.\nIt increases the activity of\nthe beta adrenergic receptors,\neven in the central nervous system\nand the astrocytes as well.\nSo it can do a few things.\nIt can slightly decrease the\ndrive for food,\nwhich astrocytes and beta\nadrenergic receptors have,\nsome medications that\nare weight loss medicines\nalso do similar things.\nBut it can be beneficial in women too.\n- But no evidence that it\nchanges estrogen output\nin women, correct?\n- Not that I know of.\n- No. Me either.\nPeptides, lot of discussion\nthese days about peptides.\nPeptides of course just\nbeing strings of amino acids,\nas you mentioned the very small ones like\ntwo amino acids like L-carnitine\nall the way up to polypeptides,\nwhich just mean many amino acids.\nThere's so many peptides that\nwe should probably just do an\nentire episode about peptides,\nbut I think one of the reasons I'm hearing\nso much about peptides these days\nis that they are not called steroids.\nThe name steroids I think\nhas come to be associated\nwith anabolic steroids\nin the context of acne,\ntestosterone rage, et cetera.\nBut of course testoster, excuse me,\nestrogen is a steroid hormone, right?\nThere are other steroid\nhormones, as we both know.\nBut peptides are gaining\nincreasing popularity.\nI am willing to go on record saying\nthat you can be sure that many\nof the incredible\ntransformations that you see\nin Hollywood are the\nconsequence of peptide use.\nAnd I'd put\nmy name behind that because\nI'm well aware of people\nthat use these to prepare for\nroles, but athletes use them.\nAnd then everyday people\nare using them too.\nFor instance sermorelin,\ntesamorelin, ipamorelin,\nto stimulate the release of growth hormone\nrather than taking growth hormone.\nBPC-157, which is essentially\na synthetic gastric juice\nthat normally repairs the gut,\nbeing used to treat injuries.\nAnd there are other are ones as well.\nWhat can we say generally\nabout peptides? Are they safe?\nAre they not safe? What about sourcing?\nAnd are there any peptides\nthat you think could be\nof particular use for people?\nAnd we should probably\nalso touch on peptides\nthat people shouldn't go anywhere\nnear with a 10-foot pole.\n- Yeah, definitely, so peptides\nare very heterogeneous.\nThere's very dangerous\nones and very safe ones.\nMy favorite peptide is\nthe original peptide,\nwhich is insulin.\nSo insulin is a peptide and\nless than 100 years ago,\nthere was a scientist studying insulin.\nAnd at some point, they\nsaw that an animal had\nits diabetes cured by\ninsulin inject, cured,\nby insulin injection.\nLess than a year later,\nthey were injecting insulin\ninto every type one diabetic,\nbecause it was saving their lives.\n- And yet insulin can kill you\nif you take it at the incorrect dose?\n- Yeah, so just like\ninsulin should be prescribed\nby a doctor, there is\nover-the-counter insulin,\nReliOn or NPH,\nbut ideally your insulin is\nprescribed by your doctor\nfor your diabetes, as it's lifesaving.\nPeptides should be prescribed\nby doctors as well.\nAnd there's several that are FDA approved.\nSo you mentioned a lot of different ones.\nLet's start with tesamorelin.\nSo tesamorelin was recently FDA approved\nfor something called lipodystrophy.\nIt happens where body fat is\ndisplaced into abnormal areas,\noften as part of aids or\nsevere burns, things like that.\nAnd it helps redistribute\nthis body fat and give people\ntheir quality of life back.\nTesamorelin is a GHRH,\nwhich I kind of loop into\nthe category of GHRPs,\nso growth hormone-releasing peptides.\nSo it's only a couple\namino acids different\nfrom endogenously-produced\ngrowth hormone-releasing hormone.\nSo growth hormone itself\nis also a peptide.\nIt's a peptide hormone.\nNot a steroid hormone.\nSo you have\ndifferent somatotrophs\nwhich are very similar\nto growth hormone.\nAnother fun fact is that HPL,\nwhich is human placental lactogen,\nwe love acronyms, right?\nHuman placental lactogen\nis nearly identical\nto growth hormone.\nThe growth hormone in pregnancy\nis not what causes the sugar\nspike in gestational diabetes.\nIt's the human placental lactogen.\nSo if you look at twin pregnancies,\nif they have two placentas\nor more placental tissue making\nmore human placental lactogen,\nthe risk of gestational diabetes\nis exponentially higher.\nSo this HPL is only a\ncouple molecules different\nfrom growth hormone.\nIt is interesting that\nthese different GHRHs\nand GHRPs actually\nhave pretty different\nmechanisms of action.\nGhrelin is also a hormone that's released\nwhen you're hungry.\nThis is probably one of the reasons\nwhy you have more growth\nhormone release overnight.\nAnd there's a lot of peptides\nthat are very similar\nto ghrelin, so these peptides\nare not bioidentical peptides,\nbut they just have a couple\ndifferent amino acids changed.\nSo they're almost identical\nand they're probably going to\nbe used in the future for\ngrowth hormone deficiencies,\nincluding in kids, they've been studied.\n- So if somebody wants\nto increase their growth hormone output,\nin addition to not eating\nwithin two hours of sleep,\ngetting good, deep sleep,\ndoing all the other\nthings in the six pillars\nthat you mentioned earlier,\nespecially resistance exercise\nat some point earlier in the day,\nwhat are the risks and benefits of taking\na growth hormone-releasing hormone peptide\nlike sermorelin prescribed\nby a doctor, of course.\nWhat should one be concerned about?\nHow long could one take these?\nI've even heard that they\ncan modify gene expression\nso that they really are\nchanging your hypothalamus\nin very long lasting ways.\n- Yeah, there's definitely a lot of risk,\ntumor growth and cancer.\nSo you look at a type one diabetic,\nthey have very high incidences\nof various types of cancer.\nThey have very high growth hormone,\nbut low IGF-1 paradoxically.\nSo they would likely give\nyou a similar cancer risk\nto a type one diabetic that\nhas very high growth hormone.\nHowever, the benefits of it,\nyou think of lipolysis,\ndecreased body fat,\nincreased lean body mass.\nA lot of those,\nyou can use other things\nto get those benefits.\nSo then you don't need growth\nhormone for those benefits.\nIt just leaves cosmetic benefit\nto which you can usually\nuse topicals to get.\nYour hair and your skin and your nails,\nthere's a lot of other\nthings that you can do\nother than growth hormone.\nSo a lot of people just\ndon't need these GHRPs\nif they don't have lipodystrophy\nor if they don't have\ngrowth hormone deficiency.\nThere is other uses of them,\nspecifically in injuries.\nSo I know that they've been studied,\nI'm not sure if it's in the military.\nWe mentioned the woodpecker\nor the contrecoup injury.\nSo that obviously.\n- The head jolting back\nand forth and the brain basically slamming\nup against the front of the skull.\n- So-\n- Football, heading the ball\nin soccer, definitely people who use\nthe 50 caliber in military,\nalthough that's a fairly small population.\nAnd I think anyone that's\nhit their head hard\nmore than once.\n- Yeah, we can talk\nabout BPC-157 for a bit,\nGHK-copper peptide for a bit.\nTB-500 or a thymosin beta-4 analog.\nAnd then we can also\ntalk about bremelanotide,\nwhich is melanotan III.\nThey have melanotan I and II,\nand then they also have\nmelanotan III and IV.\n- Yeah, let's talk about\nBPC-157 and melanotan,\n'cause I think those are the ones\nthat most people are eyeing, so to speak.\n- Yeah, so BPC-157 is body\nprotective compound 157.\nIt's identical or bio-identical\nto gastric protective compound 157\nthat's produced in the stomach.\nSo as you age, you get\natrophic gastritis very often.\nThat's why you have less intrinsic factor,\nwhich is kind of another peptide\nthat binds to vitamin B12.\nThat's why you can get\nage-related B12 deficiencies.\nSo that's one reason why\nyou have more colitis,\nmore or diverticulitis as you age.\nYou don't have that gastric\nprotective compound.\nIt increases VEGF vascular\nendothelial growth factor,\nwhich basically makes your\nblood vessels grow more.\nSo that's what causes your\nbody to form a blood vessel.\nSo another medication known as Avastin.\nIt's on the WHO's list\nof essential medications for cancer.\nSo many different types of\ncancer, including colon cancer,\nyou treat it with Avastin,\nwhich is a VEGF inhibitor.\nSo if you have cancer\nor a high cancer risk,\nyou probably don't want\nto be taking a medication\nthat's the exact opposite\nmechanism of action\nas your essential anti-cancer med.\n- In other words, if you have cancer,\nyou're at risk of cancer, avoid BPC-157?\n- Correct, a lot of people prescribe it\nfor six weeks and BPC-157,\nso bremelanotide, that is FDA approved\nfor a hypoactive sexual disorder.\nTesamorelin, that's also\napproved for lipodystrophy.\nInterestingly another\none of the melanotans\nis also approved for lipodystrophy.\nAnd also deficiency in\nthe melanocortin receptor.\nSo the receptor that receives\nthe alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,\nit's a very rare condition.\nIt's also approved for that,\nbecause if you don't take it,\nthen you get obesity.\nBut BPC-157 is not FDA approved,\nbut it is essentially standard\nof care at this point.\nI would say it's,\nif you're not counting insulin\nor growth hormone as peptides,\nit's one of the most commonly\nused peptides and anecdotally,\nand in some clinical literature,\nit's fairly well tolerated\nfor short periods of time.\nI'm not in the camp that\neverybody needs to do it two\nto three times a week or even daily\nfor six weeks no matter what.\nThe major benefit is when you're\ngoing to take it early on,\nbecause it's going to allow\nyour body to increase blood flow\nto the injured area, and\nthe less blood flow it has,\nfor example, cartilage, ligaments\nhave horrible blood flow,\nespecially as people age,\nit's going to make a\nsignificant difference.\nSo I would wager that that Russian gymnast\nthat achilles healed in one\nmonth and completely from\na full rupture was likely taking BPC-157\nor something very similar.\n- Yeah, I'm willing to\nwager on that as well,\na remarkable recovery.\nAnd so because it is prescription,\nthere are non-prescription forms,\nmy understanding of the\nnon-prescription forms\nand the danger of going\nafter non-prescription forms\nis that oftentimes they will contain\nwhat they claim they contain,\nBPC-157 in this case,\nbut they are not adequately\ncleaning out the LPS,\nthe lipopolysaccharide which\ncan cause inflammation.\nIn fact, in the laboratory,\nwe use LPS to deliberately\ninduce fever and inflammation\nto study systemic inflammation.\nSo this is a warning to people.\nIf you're interested in peptides,\nyou absolutely need to\nwork with a physician,\nin my opinion.\n- Yeah.\n- Get it from a really\ngood compounding pharmacy\nthat cleans out the LPS.\nBecause if you're buying\nit through a source that\na lot of people, I don't\nwant to name sources,\nbut there are these common\nsources on the internet\nthat everyone knows about.\nThey're buying these sources,\nthey'll ship it to anyone essentially.\nBut then the LPS is really\ncausing inflammation\nand many people experience\na kind of mild fever\nor tingling from that when they\ninject it and they're like,\noh, I can feel it working.\nThat's probably LPS action,\nwhich is not good for the brain.\nI don't know about on\nother peripheral tissues.\nI haven't heard of people\ndropping dead from this stuff yet,\nbut I certainly wouldn't\nwant to be ingesting\nany LPs unnecessarily.\nSo would you agree that you\nshould work with a doctor?\nAfter all you are a doctor.\n- Yeah.\nDefinitely talk to your doctor about this\nand talk to them about\ndosing regimen as well.\nSo if they have you\ndoing it for six weeks,\nask 'em why am I doing it for six weeks?\nWhy not two weeks or why not\nas soon as I feel better?\nCan I just stop it?\nYeah, there's a lot of\ngood questions like that\nthat you should ask your doctor.\nAnd if somebody's trying to prescribe you\na bunch of different things, then see,\nis this what they prescribe everybody\nor is this individualized for me?\nThere are peptides like GHK-copper peptide\nwhich is produced\nendogenously in the liver more\nat younger ages.\nThat's why the liver can regenerate fully,\nis this, the GHK-copper peptide helps.\nAnd if you're copper deficient,\nwhich not a whole lot of people are,\nbut a lot of people that\nhave had bariatric surgery\nare copper deficient,\nGHK-copper peptide can help significantly\nwith your nervous system.\nAnd it's also synergistic.\nSo any growth agonist\nlike thymosin beta-4 made\nin kids in the thymus, which shrinks.\nThat's another reason why\nkids heal really well.\nThat and GHK is somewhat\nsynergistic with BPC,\nbut if you don't need all\nthree, you don't want them.\nAnd if you don't need\nit for more than a week,\nyou don't want it for more than a week.\n- I really appreciate you saying that.\nI often say that sometimes\nthe best dose of something\nto take is zero.\nIt's often the case that\nthe best dosage is zero.\nYou mentioned melanotan.\nThere are several kinds of melanotan.\nI find it a little bit\nof a funny conversation,\nbecause I first learned about melanotan\nfrom reading about peptides\nand discovering that people were\ninjecting melanotan to get tan,\nbecause it's in the\nmelanin synthesis pathway.\nThey also discovered,\nthis isn't an individual.\nThis is reading about this\nin various manuscripts\nand peer-reviewed papers that\nit could cause things like priapism,\nlike sustained erection,\nthat might be the last one\nthat anyone would ever have\nbecause of damage to the vasculature.\nAlso women taking melanotan\nas a way to get tan and lose body fat.\nSo this sounds all very recreational.\nAre there any clinical usage of melanotan?\nSo separate from the kind\nof extreme biohacking cosmetic world,\nwhich is really not the main\nfocus of this podcast ever,\nmore in terms of health,\npursuing health optimization.\n- Yeah, there's actually three\nFDA approved indications,\nbelieve it or not.\nNot many people know about this,\nbut there's three well\naccepted indications.\nOne of them is the\nhypoactive sexual disorder,\nand more in women,\nthat's for bremelanotide.\n- So-\n- Those are women\nthat have essentially\nno libido whatsoever?\n- Yeah.\n- But other hormones are in check?\nYeah, classically it's before menopause.\nSo those hormonal issues\nare not contributing.\nAnd when you give them this peptide,\nit's also known as PT-141,\nit helps significantly.\nA lot of times you use it in nasal spray.\nIt goes straight into the\ncentral nervous system\nand acts centrally.\nYou can also inject it,\nand you can also take it via troche.\n- Men and women take it?\n- Correct. It's approved for women.\nBut it can also help men.\nAnd it's relatively safe.\nThe only relative contraindication\nthat I tell people\nand a lot of people say, oh,\nthere's no side effects that I know of.\nBut if you have a family\nhistory of melanoma\nor potentially have a melanoma\nand don't know about it,\nthat's why I'm a big advocate\nof dermoscopy as well\non regular skin checks,\nthen theoretically it's going to increase\nthat alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone,\nand it can grow that.\nSo that's definitely not a good a thing.\nSo be very careful about\nlongterm administration of it.\nIt's also approved for lipodystrophy,\nwhich is the same exact\nthing as tesamorelin,\nwhich I believe is also\nknown as Evista or Egrifta.\nAnd then it's also approved\nfor the rare genetic condition\nwhere your receptors or your\nmelanocytes don't proliferate\nas well, so you usually\nhave hypopigmentation.\nIt's not true albinism,\nbut it's associated\nwith morbid obesity and\nvery be poor outcomes\nfrom that in childhood, so\nit's used in kids actually.\n- Interesting, well, peptides\nare a fascinating landscape,\nbut thank you for that deep\ndive into several of them.\nWe will probably return to you\nto talk about peptides\nagain in the near future,\nbecause I know there's a lot more there.\nAnd a lot of interest.\nI want to talk about the\nsixth pillar, all right?\nSo just to remind people,\nyou said diet, exercise,\nwhere appropriate, caloric restriction,\nmanaging stress, sleep\nand sunlight are critical\nfor everyone at all ages to manage\nand optimize hormone health.\nThen you have the sixth category,\nwhich is a really intriguing\none, which is spirit.\nWhich is kind of unusual\nthing to hear coming\nfrom a medical doctor,\nexcept that I have many\ncolleagues and indeed our\nformer director of the\nNational Institutes of Health,\nFrancis Collins has talked\nabout this notion of spirit.\nWe've talked about belief effects\non this podcast before with Alia Crum,\nhow one's understanding\nof the things that they do\nand their world in general really creates\nan important effect on everything\nat the level of physiology,\nnot just psychology.\nSo as a physician,\nhow do you conceptualize\nthis spiritual aspect?\nAnd how do you talk to\npatients about this,\ngiven that people walking into your clinic\npresumably have a bunch\nof different religious\nand not a religious backgrounds.\nI'm sure some are atheists.\nSome are probably strong believers.\nHow do you deal with that?\nAnd how should people think about this?\n- Yeah, I believe it is\nsurprisingly well received.\nYou wouldn't think at first\nglance that a patient really\nwants to talk about their spiritual health\nwith their doctor,\nbut the way I think about it\nand the way that it really is\nis it's like a Venn diagram\nand you have a body and a mind and a soul.\nAnd you can't have one healthy\nwithout the other healthy,\neven if your mental health is phenomenal,\nand even if your physical\nhealth is phenomenal,\nthe mental aspect of spirituality,\nif that piece is not there,\nthen that's going to affect your\nbody physiologically as well.\nAnd Alia Crum's done some excellent work.\nThere's also been a lot of\nother studies regarding prayer.\nAnd I'm a Christian, I believe in God.\nAnd that gives me a lot of\nthat resilience and motivation.\nIt gives me the cornerstone\nor the groundwork,\nhow I can interact with life.\nAnd regardless if someone's an atheist or\nregardless of what someone\nbelieves as far as religion\nor the origin of the species,\nthey can know that their\nspirituality is going to have\na profound effect on their mental\nand physical health as well.\nPeople like to compartmentalize it.\nSo they like to talk to\ntheir doctor only about\nthe physical health 'cause\nit's comfortable to do that.\nThey only talk to their pastor or a mom or\nreiki healer for their spiritual health.\nAnd they just talk to their therapist\nor psychiatrist about their mental health.\nBut you need to bring all\nthree of those things together.\nIt's well known that\ninterdisciplinary clinics lead\nto improved patient outcomes\nand that's just disciplines\nwithin medicine.\nSo that's just doctors\nthat are specializing\nin this or this.\nSo this takes a step back\nin the upper part of that tree\nbefore you've reached those\ndichotomies or the split-offs.\nYou have your body and\nyour mind and your soul,\nso your spiritual health\nand your mental health\nand your physical health.\nSo if you're in line in\nall three of those things,\nthat builds the cornerstone\nfor the rest of your health\nand the rest of your life.\n- So if someone comes into\nyour clinic and they say,\nthey're feeling one way in their body,\nthey're feeling one way\nin their emotional life,\nyou run their charts,\nyou get their blood work,\nand they're an atheist\nor they're agnostic,\nwhat are some of the\nsixth pillar practices\nthat they can consider that are in keeping\nwith their atheism or agnosticism?\nBecause I have to assume that\npeople who are in participate\nor feel that they belong to\na particular religious sex\nwill have particular prescriptives\nfrom those religious sex\nthat will direct them towards\nparticular types of prayer.\nBut how would somebody who doesn't have\na prescriptive coming to\nthem from some other source,\nwhat could they do or would they do?\n- Yeah, so I certainly don't force prayer\non anybody or anything like that.\nBut it's my belief that being,\nespecially being an agnostic,\nit's almost the hardest thing,\nbecause if you're an atheist,\nthen you have some groundwork\nand you have some spirituality,\neven if it has to do with the\nhuman spirits' interaction\nwith the environment,\nthings that can't be\nphysically explained well,\nphenomenon like the work\nthat Alia Crum does.\nBut if you're agnostic, you're\nstill trying to find that.\nSo I hope that everybody does\nfind what they truly believe\nin as far as their own spirituality.\nBut yeah, that's a personal journey.\nFrom a physician's standpoint,\nand even if I'm friends with them as well\nfrom a friend's standpoint,\nI don't like to push anybody\nin any specific direction.\nSo I don't think that\neverybody should believe\nwhat I believe.\nAnd I don't feel like there\nshould be any pressure\nfor them to believe something different.\nSo I think that there can\nbe excellent physician-patient rapport,\nregardless of what we believe\nand what our backgrounds are.\n- Yeah. That's wonderful to hear.\nI can say without revealing any names\nthat I have close colleagues that,\nin every bin of this spectrum,\nlike hardcore atheists,\nhardcore religious in different domains,\ndifferent religions, I don't know,\nI don't know if I know many agnostic,\nas to whether or not I know\nany agnostics, I should say.\nIt's not something that\npeople commonly discuss,\nbut in the context of\nscience and medicine,\nbut it's starting to happen more and more.\nAnd certainly this issue of spirituality\nis one of the areas in\nwhich neuroscience is asking\na lot of questions.\nLike what spiritual experiences really are\nin terms of how they're\ngrounded in the brain\nor not grounded in the brain.\nI think it's a really\ninteresting area for discovery.\nAnd I appreciate that you bring it up,\nand you bring it up in the\nnon-pressured way that you do.\nI think that it will\nstimulate a lot of thinking,\nwhich is ultimately the\ngoal of this podcast.\nWell, I have one final question that\na listener insisted I ask,\nand it's a very straightforward one.\nIt's not at all a curve\nball and not at all related\nto what we were just talking about.\nBut it was the most common\nquestion when I told people\nthat I was going to be\ntalking to you, which is,\nis caffeine problematic for hormones?\nIt's amazing, I received hundreds\nof the same question about caffeine.\nAnd since it's probably\nthe most commonly used drug\non the planet,\nI know it's taking us back\ninto the very practical,\nbut in closing, we're not quite there yet,\nbut in closing is caffeine having\nan effect, one way or the other,\non testosterone, estrogen,\nor other hormones that is\npositive, negative or neutral?\n- Only if it affects your sleep.\nSo it works on adenosine\nand it can actually slightly\nimprove allergies as well,\nbut negligible effects otherwise.\n- Great.\n- Yep.\n- Well, sorry to end on\nsuch a practical brass tacks\ntype of question, but I did\npromise to the listeners\nthat I would ask that question.\nListen, I want to sincerely thank you.\nWe covered basically an\nendocrinology textbook,\na neuroendocrinology textbook's\nworth of information,\na ton of practical tips in there.\nWhere can people find out more about you?\nWe will certainly provide links.\nAnd I guess the other question\nis, are you taking patients?\nI'm sure you'll hear that\nin the various venues\nwhere people can contact you.\nBut where are you active in\nterms of public facing work?\n- I'm active on Instagram, kylegillettmd.\nI'm also active on the social\nmedias of my brand new clinic,\nwhich is Gillett Health.\nThat's @GillettHealth on\nInstagram or GillettHealth.com.\n- Great. We'll provide links to those.\nAnd I should say that\nthe content you've been\nputting out on Instagram\nis terrific because you actually pointed\nto specific studies and you put things\ninto actionable context, which\nis very meaningful for me.\nKyle, Dr. Gillett, I should say,\nthanks so much for your time.\nI really appreciate it and I\nknow the listeners will too.\n- Thank you. My pleasure.\n- Thank you for joining\nme for my discussion\nabout hormone health and\noptimization with Dr. Kyle Gillett.\nAs you just heard,\nhe is a treasure trove of\nactionable clear information.\nAnd again, you can find him\nteaching more about hormones\nand other aspects of health\non Instagram @kylegillett,\nthat's Gillett with two\nT's and two L's, but no E,\nkylegillettmd on Instagram\nand Gillett Health on all other platforms.\nAnd if you would like more\ninformation about his practice,\nyou can find that at gilletthealth.com.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to us on YouTube.\nThat's a terrific zero cost\nway to support the podcast.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to the podcast\non Spotify and Apple.\nAnd on Apple,\nyou have the opportunity to leave us up\nto a five star review.\nIf you have questions\nor comments about this,\nor any episode of the\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nor if you'd like to suggest\ntopics that you'd like us\nto cover or guests that you\nwould like me to talk to,\nplease put that in the\ncomment section on YouTube.\nIn addition, please check\nout the sponsors mentioned\nat the beginning of today's episode.\nThat is the best way\nto support the podcast.\nWe also have a Patreon.\nIt's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.\nAnd there you can support\nthe podcast at any level\nthat you like.\nDuring today's episode and\non many previous episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements certainly\naren't necessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like optimizing\nsleep and focus,\nand indeed hormone health.\nAnytime you're considering\ntaking a supplement,\nyou want to make sure\nthat the supplements are\nof the very highest quality.\nFor that reason, we've\npartnered with Thorne,\nT-H-O-R-N-E because Thorne\nsupplements are known\nto have the highest levels\nof stringency in terms\nof the quality of their\ningredients and precision about\nthe amounts of the ingredients\nthat they put in each bottle.\nMeaning what is listed on\nthe packaging is actually\nwhat's contained in those supplements,\nwhich is not true for many\nsupplement companies out there.\nIf you'd like to see the\nThorne supplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthat thorne.com/u/huberman,\nand you can get 20% off\nany of those supplements.\nAlso if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site,\nso go to thorne.com/u/huberman,\nbut then pass into thorne.com,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nin the Thorne catalog.\nIf you're not already following\nus on Instagram and Twitter,\nplease do so.\nIt's Huberman Lab on both\nInstagram and Twitter.\nAnd there I cover science\nand science-based tools,\nsome of which overlap with the contents\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut much of which is\ndistinct from the contents\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAnd again, we are hosting two live events.\nOne in Seattle on May 17th.\nAnother in Portland on May 18th.\nThat series is called\n\"The Brain Body Contract\"\nwhere I'll talk about science\nand science-based tools,\nsome of which I have never\nabout in a public forum before.\nAnd there will be an open\nquestion and answer format\nfor you to ask me your questions,\nand I will do my best to\nanswer them in real time.\nThank you once again for joining me\nfor today's discussion\nwith Dr. Kyle Gillett.\nAnd as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[energetic music]"
