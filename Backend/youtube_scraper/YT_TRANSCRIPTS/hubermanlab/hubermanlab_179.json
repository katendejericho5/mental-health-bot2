    "video_title": "Using Deliberate Cold Exposure for Health and Performance | Huberman Lab Podcast #66",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to discuss the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nfor health and performance.\nTemperature is a powerful\nstimulus on our nervous system\nand indeed on every organ\nand system of our body\nand cold in particular can be leveraged\nto improve mental health,\nphysical health, and performance,\nmeaning for endurance\nexercise, for recovering\nfrom various forms of exercise,\nfor actually improving strength and power\nand for enhancing mental capacity.\nIn order to properly leverage\ndeliberate cold exposure\nfor sake of mental health,\nphysical health and performance,\nyou have to understand how cold\nimpacts the brain and body.\nSo today we are going to discuss that.\nWe're going to talk about\nsome of the neural circuits\nand pathways, some of\nthe hormones involved.\nI promise to make it\nall clear and accessible\nregardless of whether or not\nyou have a scientific background or not.\nWe are also going to discuss\nvery specific protocols\nthat you can apply,\nwhich leverage variables like temperature,\nhow cold, how to deliver\nthe cold, for instance,\nwhether or not you use a cold shower,\ncold immersion, ice bath,\ncirculating water, or still water,\nwhether or not you're going\nfor walks outside in a t-shirt\nwhen it's cold or whether or not\nyou're purposefully\nusing things like cryo,\nif you have access to that or not.\nOne thing I can promise you\nis that by the end of today's episode,\nyou will know a lot about the\nbiology of thermal regulation,\nthat is how your brain and\nbody regulates its temperature.\nYou will also have a lot\nof tools in your arsenal\nthat you can use and leverage\ntoward improving mental health,\nphysical health, reducing\ninflammation in the body,\nimproving athletic performance,\nimproving mental performance.\nI promise to spell out all\nthose protocols in detail\nas I go along and to summarize\nthem again at the end.\nI'd like to make a point\nnow that I'm going to make\nseveral additional times\nduring today's episode\nand that is that temperature\nis a very potent stimulus\nfor the brain and body.\nThat also means that it\ncarries certain hazards\nif it's not done correctly.\nNow, everyone shows up to the table,\nmeaning to protocols,\nwith a different\nbackground of health status\nand there's simply no way that I can know\nwhat your health status is.\nSo anytime you are going\nto take on a new protocol,\nthat means a behavioral protocol\nor a nutritional protocol\nor a supplementation protocol,\nyou should absolutely consult\na board certified physician\nbefore initiating that protocol.\nI don't just say this to protect us,\nI also say this to protect you.\nIf you'd like to see\nour medical disclaimer,\nyou can go to our show\nnotes, it's described there.\nIn fact, I encourage\nyou to please do that.\nAnd in general,\nwhen embarking on new\nprotocols in particular,\nif they involve strong stimuli\nlike changing temperature\nor placing yourself into\nunusual temperatures,\nI would encourage you\nto progress gradually.\nI would also encourage you to not look at\ngradual progression as\nthe kind of weak version\nof a protocol.\nIn fact, today I'm going to discuss\na really beautiful peer reviewed study\nthat involved having people\ndo deliberate cold exposure\nso they were immersing\nthemselves into water\nup to about their neck\nand the water was actually not that cold.\nIt was only about 60 degrees Fahrenheit,\nwhich for most people is pretty tolerable.\nSo nowhere near the kinds\nof extreme temperatures\nthat one could use in other protocols.\nAnd the interesting thing is despite\nthat fairly modest cold temperature,\nby simply extending the duration of time\nthat people were in that water,\nthey experienced enormous\nincreases in neurochemicals\nthat ought to translate to\nimprovements in focus and mood.\nAnd indeed, that's what's been observed\nin subsequent studies.\nSo again, please see\nour medical disclaimer\nin our show notes, please\nproceed with caution always,\nplease also understand that\nthe most potent stimulus\nisn't always the one that you experience\nas the most intense in the moment.\nIn fact, I would encourage you to you find\nthe minimum threshold of stimulus\nthat will allow you to\ndrive the maximum benefit\nfrom each protocol and indeed,\nI will point out what those\nthresholds ought to be today.\nI'll give you some simple formulas,\ngauges or guides that you\ncan use in order to navigate\nthis extremely interesting and potent tool\nthat we call deliberate cold exposure.\nBefore we talk about\ndeliberate cold exposure\nand its many powerful applications,\nI'd like to highlight a study\nthat I find particularly interesting,\nthat I think you will find\nparticularly interesting and useful.\nThe title of this study\nis brief aerobic exercise\nimmediately enhances\nvisual attentional control\nand perceptual speed,\ntesting the mediated role\nof feelings of energy.\nNow, the reason I like\nthis study is first of all,\nit's a fairly large size sample group.\nThey looked at 101 students.\nThese were college-aged students\nand they had two groups.\nOne group did 15 minutes of\njogging at moderate intensity.\nSo they did measure percent\nheart rates, et cetera,\nbut this would be analogous\nto zone two cardio,\nwhich I've discussed\non this podcast before.\nZone two cardio is cardiovascular exercise\nthat places you at a level where\nyou can hold a conversation\nwith a little bit of strain,\nmeaning that you can get the words out,\nbut every once in a while\nyou have to catch your breath\nwhereas if you were to push\nany harder by any mechanism\ngoing faster or on a\nsteeper incline, et cetera,\nthat you would have a hard time\ncarrying out a conversation.\nSo zone two cardio is a\ncommon form of describing\nthat level of intensity that\nthey call moderate intensity.\nSo one group did 15 minute of\njogging at moderate intensity,\nwhich I'm translating to\nroughly zone two cardio.\nThe other group did 15 minutes\nof relaxation concentration\nthat is somewhat akin to\nmindfulness meditation.\nAnd then they were analyzed\nfor perceptual speed,\nvisual attentional control,\nsomething called working memory,\nwhich is your ability\nto keep certain batches\nof information online.\nJust imagine someone telling\nyou their phone number,\nand you have to remember\nthat sequence of numbers\nin your head for some period\nof time, that's working memory.\nAnd it depends very\nheavily on the so-called\nprefrontal cortical networks,\nwhich are involved in planning and action.\nAnd they also looked at\npeople's feelings of energy\nand they measured that subjectively,\nhow energetic people felt.\nNow the major takeaways from this study\nthat I'd like to emphasize are that\nthe 15 minutes of jogging group\nexperienced elevated levels of energy\nfor some period of time after\nthey ceased the exercise\nwhereas the group that\ndid mindfulness meditation\nactually reported feeling more calm\nand having less overall energy.\nNow that's very subjective\nand indeed they used\nsubjective measures to analyze energy,\nbut what gets interesting is\nwhen they looked at performance\non these various cognitive\ntasks and the two tasks\nthat they use were called\nthe trail making tests,\nthey have different versions of this,\nversion A, version B,\nI don't want to go into too much detail,\nbut version A essentially\ninvolves having a page of numbers\nthat are distributed somewhat randomly.\nSo one, two, three, four, five,\nsix, seven, eight and so on,\nbut distributed randomly across the page\nand people have to use visual search\nto circle those numbers in sequence.\nSo this involves visual attention,\nit involves some motor skills,\ninvolves a number of things\nthat certainly require energy and focus.\nThe second test was the\ntrail making test part B,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nand this involved also\ncircling numbers in sequence,\nbut interspersed between\nthose numbers were letters.\nSo rather than just having\nto circle off numbers in sequence,\nthey actually had to connect one,\nthen the letter A, then two,\nthen the letter B, et cetera\nand remember these are randomly\ndistributed across the page.\nThe major takeaway from the\nstudy is that the group that did\nthe 15 minutes of moderate\nexercise prior to these two tests\nshowed significant decreases\nin the amount of time required\nto complete these tests accurately.\nThat is interesting and indeed\nsurprising at least to me,\nbecause there have been many\nstudies looking at the effects\nof mindfulness meditation\non the ability to focus.\nThe key variable in the study\nturned out to be energy.\nThis subjectively measured\nfeeling I should say\nof having more energy and\nthereby the ability to focus,\nespecially in these high\ncognitive demand tasks.\nNow the takeaway from\nthis study for all of us\nI think is pretty straightforward.\nIf you are going to sit\ndown to do some work\nthat requires focus and working memory\nand cognitive attention\nand especially if it's some\nvisual spatial control,\nmeaning you have to search\nfor things on a page,\nyou have to organize things on a page,\nso some writing, arithmetic,\nbasically cognitive work of any kind,\n15 minutes of moderate exercise done prior\nto that work about could\nbe very beneficial for you.\nThis does not mean that\nmindfulness meditation\nwould not be a benefit to you.\nI wouldn't want you to conclude that,\nbut if you had to choose between doing\n15 minutes of mindfulness meditation\nand doing 15 minutes of moderate exercise\nprior to a cognitive work about,\nI would say the 15 minutes\nof moderate exercise would be\nmore valuable at least based\non the data in this paper.\nIn many previous podcasts,\nI have talked about the\npowerful effects of doing things\nlike mindfulness meditation,\nand other forms of NSDR,\nnon-sleep deep rest.\nSo these could be 20 minute\nnaps or just lying there quietly\nwith your eyes closed or yoga nidra\nor NSDR scripts are available on YouTube\nand various other places\nfree of cost of any kind.\nYou just go to YouTube, put in NSDR,\nnon-sleep deep rest.\nThose protocols have been\nshown to be very beneficial\nfor enhancing neuroplasticity,\nthe changes in the brain\nand body that encode\nor shift the neural circuits that allow\nfor memory to change,\nthat allow for learning to\noccur after a learning about.\nWhat I'm referring to today\nin this particular study\nis the use of moderate exercise\nin order to increase\none's focus and attention\nin order to trigger that neuroplasticity.\nSo the simple sequence here\nis get energetic and alert,\ndo that prior to the learning about,\nengage in the cognitive\nwork or learning about,\nand then mindfulness meditation,\nNSDR and so forth should follow.\nAnd if you would like to access this paper\nand like to look more at\nthe details in the paper,\nwe'll be sure to put a\nlink in the show notes.\nThe first author is Legrand.\nAnd again, the title of this\npaper is brief aerobic exercise\nimmediately enhances\nvisual potential control\nand perceptual speed,\ntesting the mediating\nrole of feeling of energy.\nAnd I also just want to\nemphasize immediately.\nI think most people out\nthere are interested in tools\nand protocols that work the first time\nand that work every time\nand indeed, I think this\nprotocol fits that bill.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat I'm hosting two live events this May.\nThe first live event will be hosted\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second live event\nwill be hosted in Portland,\nOregon on May 18th,\nboth are part of a lecture series entitled\nthe Brain Body Contract during\nwhich I will discuss science\nand science-based tools for mental health,\nphysical health and performance.\nAnd I should point out that\nwhile some of the material\nI'll cover will overlap with\ninformation covered here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast\nand on various social media posts,\nmost of the information I will\ncover is going to be distinct\nfrom information covered on\nthe podcast or elsewhere.\nSo once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,\nPortland on May 18th.\nYou can access tickets by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com/tour\nand I hope to see you there.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, also called AG One.\nI started taking AG One way back in 2012\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG One\nand the reason I still take AG One\nonce or twice a day is that it covers my\nfoundational vitamin\nmineral and probiotic needs.\nIt also has adaptogens\nand things like zinc\nfor immune system function,\nbut the probiotics are one\nof the key features in there.\nI've done several podcasts\non the gut microbiome,\nwhich are these trillions of microbiota\nthat live in our digestive tract,\nand that are crucial\nfor our immune system,\nbrain function and so on.\nOne way to enhance our gut microbiome\nto ensure that it's\nhealthy is to make sure\nthat we get the correct\nprobiotics and Athletic Greens\nhas the correct prebiotics\nand probiotics that ensure\na healthy gut microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free\ntravel packs that make it\nvery easy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nSo in the car and on the plane.\nI should mention the\nAthletic Greens is delicious.\nI love the way it tastes.\nI mix mine with some water\nand a little bit of lemon or lime juice.\nThe special offer is the\nfive free travel packs\nplus a year supply of\nvitamin D three, K two.\nVitamin D three has been\nshown to be important\nfor a tremendous number\nof biological functions.\nMany of us who get sunlight\nget enough vitamin D three,\nmany of us, even if we do get sunlight,\ndo not get enough vitamin D three.\nSo the year supply of vitamin\nD three also has K two,\nwhich is important for\ncardiovascular function,\nfor calcium regulation.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the five free travel packs\nand the year supply of\nvitamin D three, K two.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout their eye glasses\nand sunglasses were designed\nwith performance in mind.\nNow the glasses were initially designed\nfor athletic performance,\nmeaning they were designed\nto be worn while cycling or running.\nAnd indeed you can wear them\nwhile cycling or running.\nIf you get sweaty, they\nwon't slip off your face.\nThey're very lightweight.\nIn fact, you hardly ever remember\nthat they're on your face,\nat least I can't remember\nthat they're on my face.\nI wear the sunglasses when I\ndrive, I wear readers at night,\nbut they're not just for\nathletic performance.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic\nso you could wear them to the office\nor to work or to school, they look great.\nUnlike a lot of high\nperformance sunglasses out there\nthat make people look like cyborgs,\nthese you would be happy to wear anywhere.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to roka.com, that's roka.com\nand enter the code\nHuberman to save 20% off\nyour first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com.\nEnter the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are uniquely designed\nto your sleep needs.\nEverybody knows the importance\nof sleep for mental health,\nphysical health, and performance,\nbut probably what everyone doesn't realize\nis that you have unique sleep needs,\nyour body and indeed the way you sleep\nneed to be matched the correct mattress\nin order to get the best possible sleep.\nHelix understands that and\nif you go to their website,\nthey have a brief two minute\nquiz that anyone can take\nthat will match your body\ntype and sleep preferences\nto the perfect mattress for you.\nSo they ask questions like,\ndo you sleep on your side,\nyour back of your stomach,\nor maybe you don't know.\nDo you tend to run hot\nor cold through the night\nor maybe you don't know?\nI matched to the dusk mattress, D-U-S-K,\nbecause I wanted a mattress\nthat wasn't too firm nor too soft\nand I've been sleeping on that\nmattress for over a year now,\nit's the best sleep I've ever had.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minute sleep\nquiz and they'll match you\nto a customized mattress and\nyou'll get up to $200 off\nany mattress order and two free pillows.\nThey have a 10 year warranty\nand you get to try the mattress out\nfor a hundred nights risk free.\nThey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't like it\nalthough I think you will like it.\nI certainly love mine.\nAgain if you're interested,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman to get\nup to $200 off your mattress\norder and two free pillows.\nLet's talk about the use of\ncold for health and performance.\nI confess I love this topic\nbecause it takes me back\nto my undergraduate years\nwhen I worked in a laboratory\nstudying cold physiology,\nits effects on the brain\nand its effects the body.\nAnd over the years,\nI've always kept track of\nthe literature in this area\nand indeed there have been\nsome tremendous discoveries,\nboth in animal models, so in\nrodents like mice and rats,\nbut also in humans\nand today we're going to\ntalk about both categories\nof studies and I'll be careful\nto point out when discoveries\nwere made in animal models\nand when they were made in humans.\nA key point when thinking about\nthe use of cold as a tool,\nand the key point is that\nyou have a baseline level\nof temperature that is varying,\nchanging across the 24 hour cycle.\nSo any use of deliberate cold exposure\nis going to be super\nimposed on that rhythm,\nthat circadian rhythm,\nmeaning that 24 hour rhythm.\nThe basic contour of your\ncircadian rhythm in temperature\nis that approximately two hours\nbefore the time you wake up\nis your so-called temperature minimum.\nSo your temperature minimum is a time\nwithin the 24 hour cycle\nwhen your body temperature\nis at its lowest.\nSo if you normally wake up around 6:00 AM,\nyour temperature minimum\nis probably about 4:00 AM.\nIf you normally wake up at about 7:00 AM,\nyour temperature minimum\nis probably about 5:00 AM.\nIt's not exactly two hours\nbefore your wake up time,\nit's approximately two hours\nbefore your wake up time.\nNow, as you go from\nyour temperature minimum\nto the time in which\nyou're going to awake,\nyour temperature is rising slightly.\nAnd then at the point where you wake up,\nyour temperature starts\nto go up more sharply\nand will continue to go up into the early\nand sometimes even into\nthe late afternoon.\nAnd then sometime in the\nlate afternoon and evening,\nyour temperature will start to decline.\nAnd indeed, as you approach sleep,\nyour body temperature will drop\nby anywhere from one to three degrees.\nAnd in fact that decrease\nin core body temperature\nis important if not\nessential for getting into\nand staying in deep sleep.\nSo temperature rises with\nwaking, that's easy to remember.\nIt tends to continue to\nrise throughout the day\nand in the late afternoon and evening,\nyour temperature WILL start\nto go down and the drop\nin temperature actually\nhelps you access sleep.\nThat background or what we\ncall baseline circadian rhythm\nin core body temperature\nis important to remember\nbecause it helps us frame both the effects\nof deliberate cold\nexposure and helps us frame\nwhen you might want to use\ndeliberate cold exposure\nin order to access specific states.\nIt also points to times\nwithin the 24 hour cycle\nwhen you might want to avoid\nusing deliberate cold exposure,\nif your primary goal is to get to sleep.\nSo that's the circadian\nrhythm in temperature.\nNow I just briefly want to touch on\nthermal regulation at the\nlevel of body and the brain.\nAnd this will be very\nsurprising to many of you.\nLet's do what's called\na Gedanken experiment,\nwhich is a thought experiment.\nLet's say I send you\nout into the desert heat\nfor a jog or a run and\nit's very hot outside,\n102 or 103 degrees, and you start to move,\nyou start to sweat\nand of course your core\nbody temperature goes up.\nNow, then I offer you a cold towel,\nmaybe a really, really cold towel\nand this towel is saturated with water\nso you could actually\nsqueeze the water out of that\nand cool your body off.\nAnd our Gedanken experiment\nis for me to say okay,\nwhere are you going to place the towel?\nHow are you going to cool yourself off?\nAnd I'm guessing that\nmost of you would think\nthat the best way to cool yourself off\nwould be to drape that\ntowel over your head,\nmaybe your neck, over your torso,\nthat it would feel really, really good,\nand it would cool you off.\nWell, that's exactly the wrong approach\nif you want to cool off.\nAnd in fact, if you were\nto use that approach,\nyour body temperature would\ncontinue to increase even more.\nYes, even more than had you not placed\nthat cold towel on your\nhead or your torso.\nAnd here is why.\nThermal regulation meaning\nyour brain and body's ability\nto regulate your internal core temperature\nis somewhat like a thermostat\nand that thermostat\nresides in your brain.\nSo if you think about the thermostat\nin your home or apartment,\nif it's too warm in your home or apartment\nand you were to take a bag of ice\nand to put it on that thermostat,\nwhat would the thermostat do?\nIt would register the\nenvironment as artificially cool.\nIt would think that the environment\nwas actually much colder than it is.\nAnd so as a consequence,\nit would trigger a mechanism\nto further increase the\ntemperature in the room.\nAnd you have such a thermostat as well.\nIt's called the medial preoptic\narea of the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus is a small\nregion of brain tissue\nabout over the roof of your mouth\nand a little bit in front of that.\nSo it's basically right behind\nyour nose and over the roof\nof your mouth and it's\na collection of neurons.\nThose neurons have a lot\nof different functions\nthat include things like\nthe control of aggression,\nthe control of sex behavior,\nthe control of temperature\nregulation and so on.\nThe medial preoptic area\nhas connections with\nthe rest of the brain\nor areas within the brain, I should say\nand with many areas within the body,\nit receives input from\nreceptors in our skin\nand inside our body that\nregister temperature\nand it acts as a thermostat.\nSo if the surface of\nyour body is made cool,\nyour medial preoptic\narea will send signals\nby way of hormones\nand by way of chemicals that will serve\nto heat your body up.\nSo what this means is that\nif you want to cool down,\nthe last thing you want to\ndo is to bring a cold surface\nof any kind, towel or splashing water,\nto the majority of your body surface.\nIt might be very, very surprising to you.\nAnd you might say, wait,\nif I want to cool down,\nI should jump into a cold lake\nor something of that sort.\nThat's a different thing altogether.\nWhat I'll tell you,\nand we'll get into this\nin more depth later,\nis that if you really\nwant to cool down quickly and efficiently,\nyou should leverage particular portals,\nmeaning particular sites on your body\nwhere heat can leave\nyour body more readily\nand where cooling can have\na dramatic and fast impact\non your core body temperature,\ncan even save your life if\nyou're going hyperthermic.\nWe're going to talk more about\nthe specific protocols to reduce\ncore body temperature\nfor sake of performance\nand avoiding hyperthermia\nlater in the episode.\nHyperthermia of course is a\nvery, very dangerous situation\nbecause while your body can\ndrop in core temperature\nsomewhat and still be safe,\nyou can't really increase your\nbody temperature that much\nbefore your brain starts to cook\nand other organs start\nto cook and by cook,\nI mean the cells actually start to die.\nSo you have to be very, very\ncareful with the use of heat.\nHeat stroke is no joke.\nPeople die from heat stroke all the time.\nYou really want to avoid that.\nOne way to avoid that is to\ncool the appropriate surfaces\nof your body and the appropriate\nsurfaces in this case\nare the upper cheeks\nor I would say the upper half of the face,\nthe palms of your hands and\nthe bottoms of your feet.\nI've talked about this\non the podcast before\nand in the guest episode\nwith Dr. Craig Heller,\nmy colleague in the biology\ndepartment at Stanford,\nbut just very briefly, these surfaces,\nthe upper half of the face,\nthe palms of the hands and\nthe bottoms of the feet\nare what we call\nglabrous skin surfaces,\nG-L-A-B-R-O-U-S, glabrous.\nAnd those surfaces are unique\nin that just below them,\nthe vasculature is different\nthan elsewhere in the body.\nNormally the passage of blood goes from\narteries to capillaries to veins,\nbut just beneath the\nglabrous skin on the bottoms\nof the feet, the hands in\nthe upper half of the face,\nyou have what are called\narterio-venous anastomoses.\nThese are portals of\nblood that go directly\nfrom arteries to veins and in doing so,\nallow the body to dump heat\nmore readily, more quickly.\nSo as it turns out that if\nyou are to cool the palms\nof the hands, the bottoms of the feet\nand the upper half of the face,\nyou can more efficiently\nreduce core body temperature\nfor sake of offsetting hyperthermia\nand for improving athletic performance\nand maybe even cognitive performance.\nSo we will return to\nthe specific protocols\nfor doing that later in the episode,\nI'll give you a lot of\ndetails about how to do that,\nhow to do that without the use of\nany fancy or expensive technology.\nThere are some technologies\nthat are now commercially\navailable, for instance,\nthe so-called CoolMitt\nthat will allow you to do\nthat with maximum efficiency,\nbut I'll also give you some\nat home methods to do this\neither in the gym or on runs\nor for sake of cognitive work.\nSo the two key themes again\nare understand that\nbaseline circadian rhythm\nin temperature, and understand\nthat the best way to cool\nthe body is going to be\nby making sure that\nsomething cold contacts\nthe bottoms of your feet,\nthe palms of your hands and\nthe upper half of the face.\nIdeally all three\nif your goal is to lower core\nbody temperature quickly,\nand again, just cooling\noff the back of your neck\nor the top of your head\nor your torso with a towel\nis going to be the least efficient way\nto lower core body temperature\nand might even increase\nbody temperature under certain conditions.\nWith those two points in mind,\nwe can start to think\nabout directed deliberate\ncold exposure protocols,\nand there are a number\nof different reasons\nto use deliberate cold exposure.\nAnd I want to separate those out for you.\nThere are cold protocols\nthat have been tested\nin peer reviewed studies that are designed\nto improve mental performance.\nThey are designed to improve\nthings like resilience\nor your grittiness,\nor your ability to move through challenge\nor to regulate your mind\nand your internal state\nunder conditions of stress\nand we can define stress\nvery specifically as times\nwhen adrenaline also called epinephrine\nand or norepinephrine\nalso called noradrenaline,\nare elevated in your body.\nForgive me for the noradrenaline,\nnorepinephrine, adrenaline,\nepinephrine nomenclature,\nI didn't make that up.\nIt turns out that every once in a while,\nscientists disagree, imagine that,\nand you'll get multiple scientists\nnaming the same molecule different things.\nSo epinephrine and adrenaline\nare the same thing.\nI will use them interchangeably.\nNorepinephrine and noradrenaline\nare the same thing.\nI will use those terms interchangeably.\nNoradrenaline and adrenaline\nare often co-released\nin the brain and body.\nSo they work as kind of a pair to increase\nour level of agitation,\nour level of focus and our\ndesire and our ability to move.\nThey are often co-released\nfrom different sites\nin the brain and body with dopamine,\na molecule that is commonly misunderstood\nas the molecule of pleasure,\nbut is actually the\nmolecule of motivation,\nreward and pursuit.\nSo dopamine, norepinephrine\nand noradrenaline\ntend to be released together\nunder certain conditions\nand today you'll learn how\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan be used to cause increases\nin the release of several,\nif not, all of these in ways\nthat can improve your levels\nof attention and your mood.\nBut the key point is that\nyour mental state is shifted\nwhen you are exposed to\ncertain forms of cold,\nand many people use\ndeliberate cold exposure\nspecifically to shift\ntheir body state as a way\nto train their mental state\nso that they can better cope\nwith stress in real life and by real life,\nI mean when life presents\nstressful events,\nand I will give you specific protocols\nas to how you can do that, in other words,\nhow you can become more resilient\nthrough the use of\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nNow, because of the ways in\nwhich deliberate cold exposure\ncan increase this category of chemicals\ncalled the catecholamines,\nthat includes dopamine,\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine,\nit can also be used to elevate mood\nfor long periods of time.\nAnd I'm going to discuss\na specific protocol\nthat has been shown to\nincrease these chemicals\nanywhere from 2.5X to\n250%, to as high as 500%,\nfive times over baseline.\nNow you might be asking whether\nor not it is a good thing\nto raise chemicals like\nnorepinephrine and dopamine\nto such a great degree,\nwhether or not that's healthy for us,\nwhether or not they can harm us.\nBut it turns out that these\nelevations in norepinephrine\nand dopamine are very long lasting in ways\nthat people report\nfeeling vast improvements\nin mood and vast improvements\nin levels of cognitive\nattention and energy.\nSo by my read of the literature,\nthese seem to be healthy\nincreases in our baseline levels\nof these chemicals in ways\nthat can really support us\nso I'll give you a protocol for that.\nNow, those are some of the mental effects\nof deliberate cold exposure,\nbut deliberate cold exposure\nhas also been studied\nin animal models and in humans\nin the context of increasing metabolism,\neven in converting certain fat cells\nthat we call white fat cells,\nwhich are the ones where energy is stored,\nthey're the ones that\nwe typically think of\nas kind of blubbery fat,\nto beige or brown fat,\nwhich is thermogenic fat,\nmeaning that it can increase\ncore body temperature\nand serves kind of the furnace\nby which we increase our core metabolism.\nSo with a very broad stroke,\nI can say that white fat is\ngenerally the kind of fat\nthat people want less of\nand beige fat and brown fat\nis generally the kind of fat that\nif you're going to have fat cells and\nyou certainly need fat\ncells that you want more of.\nThey are thermogenic,\nthey help you stay lean.\nThey actually serve as a\nreservoir for heating your body up\nif you're ever confronted\nwith a cold challenge.\nSo we're going to talk\nabout how to use cold\nfor metabolism as well.\nAnd of course,\npeople are using deliberate cold exposure\nto reduce inflammation post exercise,\nto reduce inflammation generally.\nAnd people are also using\ncold to enhance performance\nin the context of strength training,\nin the context of endurance training\nand we'll talk about those data as well,\nbut where I'd like to start\nis with mental performance\nand I'd like to detail what happens\nwhen we deliberately\nexpose ourselves to cold.\nIt's key to point out the word deliberate.\nIf I don't say otherwise,\nthen throughout this episode,\nif I say cold exposure, I\nmean deliberate cold exposure.\nAnd the reason I point that\nout is that as my colleague,\nDavid Spiegel, and the\ndepartment of psychiatry\nat Stanford says,\nit's not just about the\nstate that we are in,\nit's about the state that\nwe are in and whether or not\nwe had anything to with placing\nourselves into that state\nand whether or not we did\nthat on purpose or not.\nAnd what he really means\nby that statement is that\nthere are important effects\nof what we call mindset.\nMindset was a topic discussed\nin the guest episode\nwith Ali Crumb some weeks ago.\nIf you haven't seen that\nepisode, I highly recommend it.\nAnd the science of my mindset\ntells us that if we are doing\nsomething deliberately and we believe\nthat it's going to be good for us,\nit actually can lead to a different set\nof physiological effects than if something\nis happening to us against our\nwill or without our control.\nNow, this is different\nthan placebo effects.\nPlacebo effects are distinct\nfrom mindset effects.\nIf you want to learn more\nabout that distinction,\nplease see the episode with Ali Crumb.\nBut again, when I talk about\ncold exposure in this episode,\nI'm talking about\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nmeaning that you are\nplacing yourself into a\ncold environment on\npurpose in order to extract\na particular set of benefits.\nWhen we talk about deliberate\ncold exposure, almost always,\nthat means getting uncomfortable.\nAnd one of the most common questions I get\nwhen discussing the use\nof cold for sake of mental\nor physical performance,\nmetabolism, et cetera,\nis how cold should it be?\nHow cold should the water be?\nHow cold should the environment be?\nAnd I just will tell you now\nand I'm going to say this again and again\nthroughout the episode,\ncause it will continue to be\ntrue throughout the episode\nand long after the episode is over,\nhow cold depends on your cold tolerance,\nyour core metabolism,\nand a number of other features\nthat there is simply no way\nI could know or have access to.\nSo I would like you to\nuse this rule of thumb.\nIf you are using deliberate cold exposure,\nthe environment that\nyou place yourself into\nshould place your mind\ninto a state of whoa,\nI would really like to get\nout of this environment,\nbut I can stay in safely.\nNow that might seem a\nlittle bit arbitrary,\nbut let's say you were\nto get into a warm shower\nand it would feel really, really nice\nand you were to start\nturning down the warm\nand turning up the cold.\nThere would be some threshold at which\nit would feel uncomfortable to you.\nAnd if you were to continue\nto make a little bit colder\nthan that, you would really\nwant to get out of the shower,\nbut you are confident\nthat you could stay in\nwithout risking your health,\nwithout risking a heart attack.\nNow that's very different\nthan jumping into\na very, very cold lake or\nI've seen these images of\npeople that will cut holes into\nfrozen over lakes and they'll\nget into that cold water.\nIf you are trained to do that\nand you have the right\nconditions, et cetera,\nthat can be done reasonably safely,\nbut that's certainly not\nwhat I would start with.\nAnd for many people,\nthat would be too cold\nand indeed some people\ncan go into cold shock\nand can die as a consequence of getting\nto that extremely cold water very quickly.\nNow that's not to scare you away\nfrom deliberate cold exposure.\nIt's just to say that there's\nno simple prescriptive\nof how cold to make environment\nin order to extract maximum benefit\nfor mental or physical performance.\nSo the simple rule of thumb is going to be\nplace yourself into an environment\nthat is uncomfortably cold,\nbut that you can stay in safely.\nAnd you'll have to experiment\na bit and that number,\nmeaning that temperature,\nwill vary from day to day.\nIt will vary across the 24 hour cycle\nbecause of that endogenous,\nmeaning that internal rhythm,\nin temperature that I\ntalked about earlier.\nLow early in the day,\nrises into the afternoon, drops at night.\nYou can actually do this\nexperiment if you like.\nTry getting into a cold\nshower at 11 o'clock at night\nif you want versus try doing it\nin the middle of the afternoon.\nIt's quite a different experience\nand by quite a different experience,\nI mean it requires quite a\ndifferent degree of resilience\nand leaning into the practice.\nYour willpower will have\nto be higher I suspect\nlate in the day as it\ncompared to early in the day,\nbut that will vary of course\nbetween individuals as well.\nSo the most common question I get\nabout deliberate cold exposure\nis how cold should the water be?\nAnd we've answered that with\nuncomfortably cold to the point\nwhere you want to get out,\nbut you can safely stay in.\nThe second most common question I get\nabout deliberate cold\nexposure is whether or not\ncold showers are as good,\nbetter or worse than cold water immersion\nup to the neck, for instance.\nI also get a lot of questions\nabout whether or not\ncryo chambers are better\nthan all the others,\net cetera, et cetera.\nI'm going to make all of that\nvery simple for you by\nsaying cold water immersion\nup to the neck with your\nfeet and hands submerged also\nis going to be the most effective.\nSecond best would be cold shower.\nThird best would be to go outside\nwith a minimum amount of\nclothing, but of course,\nclothing that is culturally appropriate\nand that would allow you to\nexperience cold to the point\nwhere you would almost want\nto shiver or start shivering.\nNow there are a number of different,\nimportant constraints\nthat are going to dictate\nwhether or not you use\none form of cold exposure\nor the other.\nFor instance, some\npeople don't have access\nto cold water immersion.\nThey don't have access to ice\nbaths or cold water tanks,\ncold ocean or cold lakes, et cetera.\nIn that case, showers would\nbe the next best solution.\nI do want to emphasize that\nthere have been very few,\nif any, studies of cold showers,\nand you can imagine why\nthis would be the case.\nIn a laboratory,\nyou want to control for as\nmany variables as possible.\nSo placing people into a cold\nwater immersion or an ice bath\nup to the neck and insisting\nthey keep their hands\nand feet under is very easy to control.\nIt means that everyone can\ndo essentially the same thing\nwhereas with cold showers,\npeople are different sized bodies.\nSome people are going\nto put their head under.\nSome people are going to lean forward.\nMeasuring the amount of cold\nwater exposure on the body\nis very hard to do\nand so there aren't a lot\nof studies of cold showers,\nbut of course,\na lot of people don't have\naccess to cold water immersion\nso they have to use cold showers.\nAnd if you don't have\naccess to both, of course,\nthen going outside on a cold\nday can be of a benefit.\nBut I will point out\nthat the heat transfer\nfrom your body into water is much higher,\nfour times greater, if not even greater,\ndepending on the temperature of the water,\nin water as opposed to in air.\nSo it's going to be much more efficient\nto do cold water immersion\nthan anything else,\ncold showers after that\nand put yourself into\na cold environment would\nbe the third best thing.\nI'm not going to get into cryo chambers\nbecause they carry quite\na high degree of cost.\nAnd again, there aren't\nmany studies of them.\nSo if you have access to cryo chambers,\nI'm sure that the cryo chamber facility\nhas told you about all\nthese incredible benefits\nand I don't doubt that some\nof those benefits truly exist,\nbut most people just\ndon't have the resources\nor the access to those\nso we're going to leave cryo chambers\nout of today's discussion.\nAnd of course I realize\nthere's a fourth category\nof cold exposure out there.\nPeople are wearing ice vests.\nBelieve it or not, those\nexist, ice underwear.\nYes, those exist.\nYou can look for them\non Amazon if you like.\nThey are putting cold\npacks in their armpits\nor in their groin or elsewhere in order to\nstimulate some of the effects of cold\non mental and physical performance.\nI'm not going to address those\nin too much detail today.\nThey can be efficient in certain ways,\nbut as you'll learn about\nlater in the episode,\ncooling the palms, the upper face\nand the bottoms of the feet\nis going to be far more efficient\nand unfortunately I think most\nof the people that are using\nice packs to increase\ntheir core metabolism\nare not aware of the glabrous skin cooling\nand how it can be a very,\nvery potent stimulus\nso we'll return to that later.\nUnless I say otherwise,\nI'm mainly going to be focusing\non cold water immersion\nand cold showers.\nSo let's talk about protocols\nfor enhancing mental health\nand performance using\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nWhat happens when we get into\ncold is that we experience\nan increase in norepinephrine,\nin noradrenaline release\nand in adrenaline release.\nThe fact that cold\nexposure, deliberate or no,\nincreases norepinephrine and epinephrine\nin our brain and body means that it is\na very reliable stimulus for increasing\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nThat's sort of an obvious statement,\nbut that obvious\nstatement can be leveraged\nto systematically build up\nwhat we call resilience.\nNow, when we experience\na stressor in life,\nwhether or not it's something bad happens\nin our relationship or something\nbad happens in the world\nand we feel stress,\nthat stress is the\nconsequence of increases\nin norepinephrine and epinephrine\nin our brain and body.\nVery similar, if not identical,\nto the kinds of increases\nthat come from deliberate cold exposure.\nSo deliberate cold\nexposure is an opportunity\nto deliberately stress our body and yet,\nbecause it's deliberate\nand because we can take certain steps,\nwhich I'll describe in a moment,\nwe can learn to maintain mental clarity,\nwe can learn to maintain\ncalm while our body\nis in a state of stress.\nAnd that can be immensely useful\nwhen encountering stressors\nin other parts of life.\nAnd that's what we call\nresilience or grit,\nour ability or mental toughness,\nour ability to lean into\nchallenge or to tolerate challenge\nwhile keeping our heads\nstraight, so to speak.\nSo one simple protocol\nfor increasing resilience\nis to pick a temperature\nthat's uncomfortable\nof shower or cold immersion,\nand then to get in for a\ncertain duration of time\nand then to get out.\nNow, it's important to understand\nthat people will\nexperience different levels\nof norepinephrine and adrenaline release\nwhen getting into cold water.\nSome people, because they\ndread the cold so much,\nwill actually experience norepinephrine\nand epinephrine increases\neven before they get into the cold water\nor under the cold shower.\nNow you may have experienced this.\nI've certainly experienced this.\nI'm dreading it, I don't want to do it\nand I have to force myself to do it.\nAnd indeed epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine and its surges\ncan be thought of as sort of\nwalls that we have to confront\nand go over.\nAnd I'd like you to\nconceptualize them that way,\nbecause it allows us to build protocols\nthat can be very\nobjective and can allow us\nto monitor our progress in\nterms of building resilience.\nSo one option is to simply say, okay,\nI'm going to force myself\nto get into the cold\nshower for one minute.\nHow cold, again, uncomfortably cold,\nbut you can stay in safely\nor I'm going to get into\nthe ice bath for one minute.\nIce baths are very cold inevitably.\nAnd what is also inevitable is that\nwhen you get into the cold,\nyou will experience a surge\nin epinephrine and norepinephrine.\nThat's non-negotiable\nbecause it's mediated\nby cold receptors on\nthe surface of your body\nand your skin and the way\nthat they trigger the release\nof norepinephrine and epinephrine,\nnot just from the adrenals,\nfrom the adrenal glands\nabove your kidneys,\nbut also from regions of your brain,\nlike the locus coeruleus,\nwhich cause increases in\nthe tension and alertness,\nand from other locations in\nyour body where epinephrine\nand norepinephrine are released.\nIn other words, cold is\na non-negotiable stimulus\nfor increasing epinephrine\nand norepinephrine.\nEven if you are the\ntoughest person in the world\nand you love the cold,\nthat increase in epinephrine\nand norepinephrine\nis going to happen.\nSo the way to think about\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\nin this context of\nbuilding mental resilience\nis that you have two options.\nYou can either try to\nextend the duration of time\nthat you are in the\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nSo going from one minute to\n75 seconds to two minutes\nand so on over a period of days\nor one way to approach this\nand the way that I particularly favor\nis to take the context of the day\nand the moment into account,\nmeaning we have different\nlevels of grit and resilience\non different days and\ndepending on the landscape\nof our life at the time,\neven the time of day that\nwe're doing these protocols\nand start to be able to sense\nthe release of epinephrine,\nand norepinephrine in our\nbrain and body and see those\nas walls that we want to climb over\nin order to build resilience\nand to start counting\nthe number of walls that we traverse\nand the distance between those walls\nas we do deliberate cold exposure.\nLet me give you an example\nof the timed protocol\nbecause that one is very straightforward,\nalthough I do not think it is as powerful\nfor building mental resilience.\nThe time protocol would be Monday,\nI do one minute of\ndeliberate cold exposure\nat a given temperature.\nWednesday, I extend\nthat by 50% and Friday,\nI do deliberate cold\nexposure for twice as long\nas I did it on Monday.\nAnd if I were to continue that every week,\nMonday, Wednesday, Friday,\nI would continue to either\nincrease the duration\nor I would lower the temperature\nand reduce the duration,\nthis kind of thing, very much\nlike sets and reps in the gym.\nNow that option is very objective.\nYou could even log it in a book\nand as you develop the ability\nto stay in cold temperatures,\neven progressively colder\nand colder temperatures\nfor longer and longer periods of time,\nyou will become more resilient.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, my operational\ndefinition of resilience\nis that you are able to resist\nescape from the stressor,\nthe cold, by virtue of your willpower,\nwhich is really your prefrontal cortex\ncausing top down control on your reflexes\nand your limbic system\nand your hypothalamus,\nwhich are basically telling you\nto get out of that cold water,\nget out of that cold\nenvironment and in doing so,\nyou are basically getting better\nat controlling your behavior\nwhen your brain and body\nare flooded with\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nThat's a very reductionist\nway to explain resilience\nor grit or mental toughness,\nbut it's a reductionist\nway of explaining it\nthat is very closely\ntied to the biology end\nof the psychology.\nAnd it is a fact that\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine\nrelease in the brain and body\nare the generic universal\ncode for stressor.\nThere is no unique chemical signature\nfor different forms of\nstressors, that is the only one,\nalthough of course there are\nother chemicals involved as well.\nSo you could go for time and you could try\nand reduce the temperature\nand increase the time\nover a period of days or weeks.\nNow that's an attractive\nway to approach things,\nbut the problem is that you\ndon't have an infinite amount\nof room with which to lower temperature,\nbecause eventually you\nwill get into temperatures\nthat are either so cold\nthat they are dangerous\nor you have to stay in cold temperatures\nfor such long periods that\nit becomes impractical\nbecause presumably you also have to\ntake care of other aspects of your life,\nyou can't just sit all\nday in the ice bath.\nNow for that reason,\nI favor a protocol in which\nyou build mental resilience\nand mental toughness through\ntwo different types of protocols.\nThe first one involves counting walls.\nNow, what do I mean by walls?\nI mean the sensation of, no,\nI don't want to do this and\nthe idea or the sensation\nin your brain and body that\nyou actually want to leave\nthat environment and go warm up.\nNow again, for some people,\nthat will be even before\ngetting into the ice bath\nor cold shower.\nSo if you are feeling very resistant\nto getting into the ice bath\nor cold shower and you manage to do that,\nthat's going over what\nI would call one wall.\nThen for some period of time,\nyou might actually feel\ncomfortable in the ice bath,\ncold water or cold shower.\nAnd you feel like you could stay there\nfor some period of time,\nthat you could stay there\nfor a minute or two minutes,\nbut inevitably, the next wall will arrive.\nAnd I would encourage\nyou to pay attention to\nwhen that next wall arrives\nand actually having an awareness,\nthat so-called interceptive\nawareness as we call it,\nof when that next surge\nadrenaline epinephrine comes\nor whether or not it\nreaches a certain threshold\nin your brain and body that\nyou feel you want to get out\nand you're able to stay in for\neven just 10 seconds longer,\nthat means you've\ntraversed yet another wall.\nAnd if you continue to stay\nin that cold environment,\nyou'll find that the next wall will come\nand the next wall will come.\nNow eventually of course,\nyou will get very, very numb\ndepending on how cold it is\nand you could also place\nyourself into danger.\nSo you have to maintain cognitive control,\ncounting these walls,\ntraversing these walls,\nbut getting out at some point, of course.\nSo my favorite protocol for\nbuilding mental toughness\nAKA grit, AKA resilience,\nis to take into account that some days,\njust getting into the ice bath\nor cold shower represents a\nwall, some days it doesn't.\nSome days you get in and you\nfeel you could go 10 minutes,\nother days you get in and you feel like\nyou could only go a minute and\nsetting a designated number\nof walls before you start the protocol\nis going to be very beneficial here.\nSo you say, as long as I can do it safely,\nI'm going to do three walls today.\nThe first wall is getting in.\nThe second wall will\narrive when it arrives\nand the third wall will\narrive when it arrives\nand I'll get over that\nwall and then I'll get out.\nThe next day, you might do five walls.\nThe next day, you might\ndo three walls again,\nbut you might lower the temperature.\nThis gives you tremendous flexibility\nand indeed it gives you much more latitude\nto be able to use the same\ntemperatures in different ways,\nor to reduce the temperature\nonly a little bit\nand still get a lot of stimulus,\nmeaning a lot of results\nout of a given protocol.\nWhereas people who are just\ngoing for temperature and time\neventually become cold adapted.\nThey get very, very good\nat doing three minutes\nor six minutes or even 10\nminutes at a given temperature\nand so then they feel like they have\nto lower the temperature\neven more and even more\nand eventually they just bought them out.\nThere's nowhere else to go.\nThere's no way to get\nimprovements out of the protocol.\nAt least not in terms\nof mental resilience.\nOf course, there's still\nthe positive effects\non inflammation and metabolism, et cetera,\nthat we'll talk about in a little bit.\nBut the key thing here\nis to design protocols\nthat are going to work for you over time\nand for you very, very hardy,\nvery, very tough guys and gals out there\nthat can get right into\nan ice bath or a very, very cold immersion\nand you can just grind it\nout for six or 10 minutes,\nor you can even do that\nby remaining peaceful,\nwell more points to you, but guess what?\nThat's the equivalent of\nalready having loaded up\nthe barbell with 600 pounds\nand done your 10 reps.\nThere's not a whole\nlot more variable space\nwith which to get benefits\nfrom that stimulus.\nAnd in the weight room,\npeople understand that you\ncan adjust, for instance,\nthe speed of the movement,\nor you can start combining that movement\nwith pre-exhaustion, et cetera.\nWith cold exposure,\nyou don't have as much\nvariable space to play with.\nSo if your goal is to build resilience,\neither go for time as a\nfunction of temperature,\nor what I suggest is to\nstart recognizing these walls\nas an experience of resistance in you\nand going over those walls,\nset a certain number of walls\nthat you're going to go over\non a given day and do that\nat a given temperature,\nand then to mix it up.\nAnd ideally you might even\nthrow in one more wall\nat the end,\nif you're really feeling bold and brave\nbecause that's going to\nbuild out further resilience.\nBut if you want cold\nexposure to work for you\nfor sake of building up resilience\nand mental toughness over time,\nyou're going to want to\nvary this parameter space\nin some sort of way.\nAnd you don't have to be\nsuper systematic about it.\nThat's the beauty of this kind of approach\nbecause you're relying on the fact\nthat those walls really represent times\nin which you are forcing\nyour top down control,\nyour prefrontal cortex to\nclamp down on your reflex\nand you're learning behavioral\ncontrol in the context\nof your body having elevated levels\nof these catecholamines,\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nAnd that translates to real life\nin a much more realistic way I\nbelieve because in real life,\nyou're not really engaging in stressors\nfor a given amount of time\nthat you know how long it's going to last\nand you know the context, no.\nMost stressors arrive\nin the form of surprises\nwe don't like, text messages\nthat deliver bad news,\ninformation about the\noutside world or real world\nand online interactions\nthat send our system\ninto a state of increased\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nAnd if you start to\nthink of those as walls\nthat you can tolerate and climb over\nwhile staying and calm and clear of mind,\nthen you can really\nimagine how the ice bath\nand other forms of cold\nexposure are really serving\nto train you up for real life stressors.\nThe next question that I always get is\nwhat should my mental state be\nwhile I'm exposing myself\nto this uncomfortable,\nyet safe condition of cold?\nWell, you have two options\nand there are probably\nother options as well.\nOne is to try and calm yourself\nto remain as mentally still as possible.\nThe other is to lean into that challenge\nand so to grind it out and here,\nI have to say that this is\na lot like teaching someone\nto drive on a gravel road.\nFor any of you that have\ndriven on a gravel road,\nyou know that there is no optimal speed\nfor all gravel roads.\nIt depends on the density\nof the gravel, et cetera,\nand the vehicle, et cetera.\nSo for instance, on some gravel roads,\nwhen you start to drive and\nthe dust starts to kick up,\nyour best option is to drive fast\nand put that dust cloud behind you.\nOn other gravel roads,\nif you try and do that,\nthe dust actually kicks\nup around the vehicle\nand it makes it hard to see\nand sometimes you have to slow down.\nThe same thing is true for getting through\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nSometimes it's easier to calm yourself.\nOne way to do that is\nthrough double inhales\nthrough the nose and extended\nexhales through the mouth,\nor simply by trying to\ncontrol your breathing\nand reduce the pace of\nyour breath and increase\nthe volume of your breathing.\nI have to say that everyone\nexperiences a shortening\nof breath when they get into\nuncomfortably cold water,\nthat is a universal\nphysiological response.\nEveryone also experiences\na 30 to 80% decrease\nin cognitive function, in\nparticular, the frontal cortex.\nThe metabolism of your\nfrontal cortex goes down,\nthe metabolism meaning the\nactivity of brain areas\nassociated with stress\nand panic goes way up.\nAnd so anchoring your mind\nin cognitive activities\nas you get into the cold can be very,\nvery helpful for\nmaintaining clarity of mind.\nIn fact, one thing that\nI sometimes recommend\nis that people try and engage\nin some sort of cognitive\nexercise while in the cold,\nnot as a form of distraction,\nbut as a way to maintain\nclarity of thinking\nand to learn how to do that\nwhen the body is flooded\nwith all these chemicals\nthat make us stressed.\nSo for instance,\nyou could do math problems and\nnot two plus two equals four,\nnot three times three equals nine,\nbut things that require\na little bit more focus\nand attention working memory and so forth.\nYou could also start to have thoughts\nthat you deliberately impose\na full sentence structure on.\nThat's actually quite tough.\nYou could try and recall\nspecific bouts of information\nthat are challenging.\nThis is teaching your\nmind how to stay online,\nor rather I should say,\nthis is you teaching\nyour prefrontal cortex,\nhow to stay engaged while you\nhave high levels of stress\nin your body.\nYears ago, I had a friend who works\nin the neuroscience world,\nresearch neuroscientist,\nwho was obsessed with\nthis very bizarre sport\nthat I don't necessarily recommend at all,\nwhich is the combination\nof boxing and chess.\nYou may have seen this on YouTube\nwhere people will box around,\nlegitimate boxing around,\nthey're sparring all out often.\nAnd then at the end of the round,\ninstead of resting in the corner,\nthey actually sit down and play chess,\nand then they go back to\nboxing and back to chess.\nAgain, not a sport that I recommend,\nbut the reason he was\nobsessed with this is because\nhe studies the impact of stress\non cognitive performance.\nAnd what that particular\nvery bizarre sport was doing\nwas toggling back and forth\nbetween different states of mind.\nNow it's used both to\nincrease cognitive clarity\nfor the fighter when they box,\nbecause staying calm and clear thinking\nis very important to\nwinning boxing matches.\nBelieve it or not, it's\nnot an all outrage.\nIt's a very calculated\ngame of mental chess\nand physical chess\nthat's quite high stakes\nas you can imagine.\nIt's also used in some circles\nas a way to teach people\nhow to engage in cognitive performance\nwhen their body is simply\nfilled to a stress.\nSo in the boxing chess example,\nthe replacement for the cold\nwater is actually the boxing,\nit's the thing that's\nsupposed to induce the stress\ncause getting hit is\nstressful and the risk\nof getting hit is\nstressful for most people.\nSo again, if you think about\ndeliberate cold exposure\nas a way of just\nsystematically and reliably\ninducing epinephrine and\nnorepinephrine release\nand delivering stress,\nwell then this idea of\nmaintaining cognitive clarity\nand actually engaging in cognitive tasks\nwhile in the ice bath or cold shower\ncan actually be very beneficial.\nEven though it might\nsound a little bit silly,\nyou are really training up your ability\nto keep your brain working\nwhen the reflex is to shut\ndown the parts of your brain\nthat are involved in deliberate\nplanning and thinking.\nNow another important aspect\nof deliberate cold exposure\nthat I rarely if ever hear discussed,\nbut is vitally important is whether or not\nyou move around or not.\nAnd here's the reason.\nWhen you get into cold\nwater and you remain there\nfor some period of time,\nyour body is generating\nheat and that heat generates\nwhat's called a thermal layer\nthat surrounds your entire body.\nSo if you stay still,\nyou are actually warmer\nthan if you move around,\nyou can try this the next time\nyou're doing your\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nIf you're submerged up to the neck,\nsit there for about 10, 30 seconds\nand be very, very still of body.\nIn fact, this is the way\nthat most people start\nto do deliberate cold exposure.\nThey give this very stoic look.\nThey don't blink, they look very peaceful.\nSome of them even look tough\nor they make a very even A, emotional face\nand so it looks like they're really tough,\nbut they are so still\nthat believe it or not,\nthey're not providing\nthe most potent stimulus.\nIf they or you were to\nmove around in that water,\nwhat would happen is you'd\nbreak up the thermal layer\nand that you actually\nexperience that as much colder.\nSo if you really want to\npush the resilience aspect,\nor for instance, if you want\nto use a given temperature\nthat you're comfortable in,\nbut that you want to increase the stimulus\nand you want to get some more benefit\nfor mental resilience training,\nwell then get into the cold water,\nmove your body around continuously,\nbut try and keep your mind still,\nor even do some sort of cognitive task.\nSo as you're starting to realize,\nthere are a bunch of different variables\nthat you can play with while maintaining\nthe same temperature of\nwater and in doing so,\nreally keep you in the zone of what should\nand absolutely has to be safe for you\nwithout having to just\ncontinually drop the temperature\nfrom say 60 degrees to 55 to 40 to 33\nbecause as I mentioned before,\neventually you're going to bottom out.\nSo if you're one of those\npeople that likes to look tough\nor really relaxed while\nyou're in the ice bath\nor cold water immersion,\njust realize that you're\nactually cheating yourself out\nof part of the stimulus.\nKeep those limbs moving and of course,\nlimbs under the water, feet and hands\nis going to be a more potent stimulus\nthan hands and feet out for reasons\nthat should be obvious based\non what we talked about\nin terms of glabrous skin cooling.\nKeep those submerged, move your body,\nmaybe move your knees up\nand down, pedal your feet\nand trust me, it's going\nto feel a lot colder\nthan were you to remain stone still.\nAnother very common question\nis how often to do\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nIt's tough to make a\nrecommendation on that\nbased on any peer reviewed study\nalthough there are a few in\nhumans that point to a threshold\nof 11 minutes total per week.\nSo that's total throughout the week\ndivided into two or four sessions\nof two or three minutes or so.\nNow that 11 minute cutoff\nis not a strict threshold\nand is actually geared more\ntowards increases in metabolism,\nwe'll get into this a little\nbit later in the episode,\nbut I think the 11 minute threshold,\nmeaning 11 minutes total\nof deliberate cold exposure\nper week is a pretty good number to use\nif you need a number in\norder to keep you consistent.\nBut as we talked about earlier,\nsome of you are going\nto be in the ice bath\nor cold immersion or cold\nshower for one minute,\nothers of you will be\nin there for 10 minutes,\ndepending on how frequent\nand how high, if you will,\nthose walls of adrenaline are coming.\nSo for some of you,\ngetting into a cold shower\nfor three minutes total\nfor the whole week will\nrepresent a tremendous\nachievement in terms of\nwillpower and overcoming\nthe resistance to doing\nthat, overcoming those walls.\nFor others of you, three\nminutes is nothing.\nSo what do I recommend,\nI recommend that you get at\nleast 11 minutes total per week,\nbut at the point where\n11 minutes total per week\nis very easy for you,\nwhere is no longer representing\na significant mental challenge,\nmeaning you're not experiencing\nmany of these walls,\nyou're excited to get into\nthe cold shower immersion,\nyou're going through it easily,\nyou're cruising basically.\nThen I would say either\nlower the temperature safely,\nof course, extend the\nduration safely, of course,\nor increase the frequency\nso that you're doing this\nperhaps every day or\nmaybe five days a week\nor three days a week.\nI personally get tremendous benefit\nfrom doing deliberate cold\nexposure three times a week\nand using the walls method\nthat I described earlier\nas my gauge for how long to stay in\nand typically that means that\nI'm staying in for anywhere\nfrom two minutes to\nsix minutes per session\nand that averages out to about\n11 to 15 minutes total per week.\nSo again, I do not think that\nyou need to be super strict\nabout these guidelines.\nIt's most important when\nembracing a protocol A,\nthat you do it safely,\nbut secondarily that\nyou do it consistently.\nSo find what you can do consistently\nand then vary the parameters\nthat will allow you to continue to do\ndeliberate cold exposure consistently,\nregardless of whether or not\nyou have access to a shower\nor cold immersion, et cetera.\nSo we've been talking about mental effects\nand the use of deliberate cold exposure\nfor sake of building resilience,\nwhich I do believe can\nbe tremendously powerful.\nLook, it's no coincidence\nthat the screening\nand the training for Navy Seals\ninvolves a lot of exposure to cold water.\nOne could argue that it is deliberate\nbecause they elect to go to buds,\nbut when they get into\nthe cold water at buds\nis dictated by the\ninstructors and the reason\nthey use cold water\nexposure as the stressor\nis that it does offer considerable leeway\nin terms of duration and temperature,\nin terms of how you can\nuse it as a stressor\nwhereas things like heat don't\noffer much variable space\nas we say.\nThere isn't a lot of room\nbeyond which you start injuring\nor even killing people by using heat.\nSo there are a lot of forms\nof stressors out there,\nbut cold is one that we can titrate,\nthat we can adjust in\nways that can allow us\nto continually build up and\nor maintain mental toughness.\nNow, deliberate cold exposure\nalso has many effects\non chemicals other than\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine,\nmost notably the neuromodulator dopamine,\nwhich is involved in elevating our mood,\nmaking us feel energized and\nenhancing our ability to focus.\nAnd that has a lot to do\nwith how dopamine engages us\nin motivated states,\ntends to narrow our\nthinking in our behavior\ninto a particular trench\nof goal-directed behavior.\nIf you want to learn more about dopamine,\nyou can learn a lot about dopamine\nin our episode about dopamine,\nit's at hubermanlab.com.\nYou can find it, it's a\ntwo and a half hour plus\nkind of deep dive into\nall things dopamine,\nfocus, motivation, et cetera.\nDeliberate cold exposure\nhas a very powerful effect\non the release of dopamine\nin our brain and body.\nAnd this is one of the main\nreasons why people continue\nto do deliberate cold exposure.\nBasically it makes us feel good\nand it continues to make us feel good\neven after we get out\nof the cold environment.\nIn fact, some people would say\nthey don't feel good in\nthe cold environment,\nit's all stress for them,\nbut afterwards they feel great.\nOne of our previous\nguests, Dr. Anna Lembke,\nwho's a medical doctor\nat Stanford University\nSchool of Medicine, she's\na close colleague of mine,\ndescribed the use dopamine\nin her book, Dopamine Nation,\nan incredible book about\naddiction and dopamine\nI should mention.\nAnd the use of dopamine\nelicited by cold water exposure\nby one of her patients.\nWhat I'm referring to is the\nfact that one of her patients\nhelped themselves get\nand stay sober off drugs\nby using deliberate cold\nexposure to increase dopamine.\nSo a healthier form of dopamine release\nthan they were engaged in\nprior to getting sober.\nNow, the basis for dopamine release\nin response to cold exposure\nis that the catecholamines,\nnorepinephrine,\nepinephrine and dopamine\ntend to be co-released\nby the same sorts of stimuli,\nbut most stressors and\nin particular things\nthat evoke stress or our\nfeelings of stress internally\nthat we don't like do\nnot increase dopamine.\nThey only increase\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine,\nbut deliberate cold exposure\nseems to cause a dramatic\nincrease in dopamine.\nAnd this has actually been substantiated\nin a really beautiful study entitled\nhuman physiological responses\nto immersion into water\nof different temperatures.\nThe first author is Sramek.\nI'm almost certainly\npronouncing that poorly\nand if not incorrectly, S-R-A-M-E-K.\nThis was published in the European Journal\nof Applied Physiology in the year 2000,\nreally a beautiful\nstudy, I love this study.\nThey took people and they\nhad them sit in chairs\nunderwater but their head was\nout and so they were immersed\nup to the neck in either of\nthree different temperatures.\n32 degrees Celsius, which\nis 89 degrees Fahrenheit,\n20 degrees Celsius, which\nis 68 degrees Fahrenheit,\nor 14 degrees Celsius, which\nis 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit.\nSo not super cold, but then what they did\nis they measured people's core\nbody temperature throughout.\nThey measured their metabolism\nand they looked at serum levels\nof things like norepinephrine,\nepinephrine, dopamine,\nand cortisol, serum\nmeaning within the blood.\nSo a really nice and quite thorough study.\nThere were not a huge number\nof subjects in the study,\nbut nonetheless, it was\na very thorough study\nin terms of the number of\nvariables that they explored.\nSo I just want to briefly highlight\nsome of what they saw or what\nthey observed in this study.\nFirst of all, all the\ngroups were in the water\nof a given temperature for one hour,\nwhich is much longer than most\nof the deliberate cold exposure protocols\nthat anyone is using at home.\nI mean, maybe you're taking\none hour long cold showers,\nmaybe you're getting into\nthe ice bath for an hour\nalthough I don't recommend that.\nI think you'd probably get\nbadly hypothermic or maybe\nyou're getting into a cold water immersion\nfor some period of time,\nbut I have a hard time imagining\nthat it would be an hour\nand I don't suggest\nthat if it's very cold.\nSo this study focused on actually somewhat\nmoderately cool temperatures,\nnot what I think most\npeople would consider\nvery, very cold temperatures,\nbut extended the duration\nfor quite a while.\nSo again, 32 degree Celsius,\n20 degree Celsius or 14 degree Celsius.\nHere's what they observed.\nThe group that was immersed up to the neck\nin 32 degrees Celsius, that\nis 89 degrees Fahrenheit,\nwater did not experience\na shift in metabolism\nnor a significant increase in dopamine,\nnorepinephrine or these\nother catecholamines.\nThe group that was in 20 degree Celsius,\nmeaning 68 degree Fahrenheit,\nwater for an hour\nexperienced a 93% increase\nin metabolic rate, which is remarkable\ngiven that the water wasn't that cold\nand yet an hour is a pretty\nlong time to be in there.\nAnd again, it speaks\nto the dramatic effect\nof heat transfer that water\nhas, which I mentioned earlier,\nas opposed to being out\nin the air at 68 degrees,\nit would certainly not cause that increase\nin metabolic rate.\nThe group that was at 14 degrees Celsius,\nmeaning 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,\nwater for an hour experienced\na 350% increase in metabolism.\nSo huge increases in metabolism.\nNow the most interesting data to me,\nat least in terms of mental effects\nof deliberate cold exposure,\nwere that the plasma or serum\nlevels of norepinephrine\nin the blood increased 530%.\nThese are huge increases in norepinephrine\nso it suggests that this\nis a stressful stimulus\nat least neurochemically\nspeaking, stressful,\ndespite the fact that\nit's not super super cold,\nalthough 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit,\n14 degrees Celsius it's\nnot a warm environment,\nbut it's not a ultra,\nultra cold environment,\nbut an hour is a very\nlong time to be in there.\nThe subjects also\nexperienced a 250% increase\nin dopamine concentrations,\nwhich while not 530% as\nit was with norepinephrine\nis still a very large increase\nin baseline levels of dopamine.\nAnd what was interesting is\nthat those increases in dopamine\npersisted for a very long\nperiod of time afterwards,\neven out to two hours.\nAnd they stopped the\nstudy after 120 minutes\nof getting out of the\ncold, but nonetheless,\nthese increases in norepinephrine\nare huge and long lasting\nand these increases in dopamine\nare very large and long lasting.\nAnd I do believe that these\ndocumented effects in humans\nexplain much of the enhancement\nof attention and of feelings\nof wellbeing and mood that\npeople typically experience\nafter doing deliberate cold exposure.\nAnd the reason I say that is that\nif you were to go back to the episode\nthat I did on dopamine,\nor you were to go back to the episode\nthat I did with Dr. Anna Lembke\non addiction and dopamine,\nwhat you would find is\nthat increases in dopamine\nof the sort evoked by\ndeliberate cold exposure\nare actually very similar\nto the kinds of increases\nin dopamine that are elicited\nby things like nicotine\nor from other behaviors\nthat are known to be\naddictive and bad for us\nbecause they lead to\nother effects on the brain\nand body that we simply don't want.\nAnd yet deliberate cold\nexposure provided is done safely\ncan create similar if not\ngreater increases in dopamine\nthat are not just fleeting,\nthat don't just occur during,\nsay the consumption of some\ndeleterious drug or activity,\nbut that are very long lasting\nand that can be leveraged\ntoward activities other than\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nSo I want to emphasize this.\nI'm not suggesting\nthat people do deliberate cold\nexposure for an hour a day.\nAnd unfortunately there\nare not many studies yet\nexploring how shorter colder temperature\nenvironment exposure, say\none minute or three minutes\nor six minutes at 55\ndegrees or at 50 degrees,\nwhether or not that leads to similar,\ngreater or reduced levels of\ndopamine in the brain and body.\nAnd yet almost everybody who\ndoes deliberate cold exposure\nwill say yeah, it was stressful.\nI didn't enjoy it, or I\neventually grew to like it,\nbut that I always feel better afterwards\nand then that feeling last\na very long period of time.\nAnd I think it's almost certain\nthat those experiences that people report\nrelate to these increases in dopamine\nand in concert with the\nincreases in norepinephrine\nalso explain the other effect\nthat's commonly reported,\nwhich is an enhancement in mental acuity\nand the ability to focus.\nNow, here we can extrapolate to the study\nthat I discussed at the\nearly part of the episode,\nwhere I was talking about the use of\nshort 15 minute exercise,\nkind of moderate intensity exercise\nand how that was shown to\nincrease levels of energy\nand mental acuity\nin these working memory,\nvisual attention tasks.\nAnd there, again, we\nhave to assume somewhat\nbecause they weren't doing\nneurochemical measurements,\nbut we can reasonably assume\nthat those improvements\nin cognitive performance were due\nat least in part to the\nincrease in catecholamines\nknown to a company, moderate\nintensity zone two cardio.\nSo what you're starting\nto see here is a theme.\nThe theme is that virtually any stimulus\nthat delivers more norepinephrine,\nepinephrine and dopamine to our system\nwill sharpen our mental\nacuity and elevate our mood\nand will do so for some period of time.\nDeliberate cold exposure, it turns out,\nis a very potent way to\nincrease these catecholamines,\nthis category of chemicals\nand thereby to improve mood,\nmental acuity and levels of alertness.\nAnd as we'll next see, it\nnot only has that effect,\nwhich can be very\nbeneficial for many people\nin a bunch of different circumstances,\nbut it also has the positive\neffects that many people seek\nin terms of metabolism, in\nlowering inflammation in the body\nand other physiological effects as well.\nAnd forgive me,\nI was almost ready to move on to effects\nof deliberate cold exposure on metabolism\nand inflammation and so forth,\nbut I neglected to point\nout one of the other\nvery interesting aspects of the study\nshowing deliberate cold exposure\ncan increase in\nnorepinephrine and dopamine,\nwhich is that they observed\nno significant increases\nin the stress hormone cortisol\nand that is both surprising,\ninteresting, and important\nbecause what it means is\nthat the quality of stress\nthat deliberate cold exposure\nis creating in the body\nis likely to be one of\nwhat we call use stress.\nHans Selye, the great physiologist,\nwon a Nobel Prize for\ndistinguishing between distress,\nwhich is stress in the brain and body\nthat causes the release\nof things like cortisol\nalong with the other catecholamines,\nand that we experience as\nnegative happening to us\nand can lead to negative health outcomes.\nAnd he distinguished that from eustress,\nwhich was stress that we now understand\nis associated with increases\nin things like norepinephrine\nand dopamine, but no\nincreases or minimal increases\nin cortisol, and that can lead\nto positive health outcomes.\nSo it appears that deliberate\ncold exposure can create\nwhat we call or what Hans\nSelye called eustress.\nIn other words, it can create\na condition in the brain\nand body in which we\nare stressing ourselves,\nwe are training up resilience,\nand yet we are creating\na neurochemical milieu\nthat actually has many health benefits.\nNow I'd like to shift our attention\nto the effects of deliberate\ncold exposure on metabolism.\nAnd I'd like to start by detailing a study\nthat was performed on humans\nand published just at\nthe end of last year.\nThe title of the study is altered\nbrown fat thermoregulation,\nand enhanced cold induced thermogenesis\nin young, healthy winter swimming men.\nAnd I should point out\nthat while the study\nwas only performed on male subjects,\nthere's no reason to\nthink that the effects\nthat they discovered\nwould only pertain to men.\nI would hope that they would\nalso do a study on women\nat some point in the future,\nbut the effects that they describe\nare very basic core\nphysiological processes.\nWhat they did is they looked\nat at deliberate cold exposure\nin this group of young men,\nand they used that 11\nminute threshold per week.\nSo in other words, they had\nthem get into cold water\nfor approximately 11 minutes per week.\nAnd again, that's 11\nminutes total per week.\nThey divided that into two sessions\nalthough in speaking with the\nfirst author of this study,\nDr. Susanna Søberg,\nI learned that it\nprobably is not important\nthat it be two sessions,\nit could be three or even four sessions,\nas long as it reaches\nthat 11 minute threshold.\nWhat they discovered was\nthat by going into\nthese cold environments,\nin this case cold water\nimmersion up to the neck,\nfor 11 minutes total per week,\nthat these men experienced increases\nin so-called brown fat thermogenesis,\nI'll talk more about\nwhat that is in a moment,\nand increases in core body temperature\nthat translate to increases\nin core body metabolism.\nNow, the overall increases\nin core body metabolism\nthat they experienced\nwere not extremely large.\nThey were statistically significant,\nbut they weren't extremely large.\nHowever, the changes in brown fat stores\nare perhaps what's most\ninteresting about this study\nand I'll tell you why.\nThe metabolic increases of\ndeliberate cold exposure\nare both acute meaning\nhappening in the short term.\nWhen you get into the cold\nand immediately after,\none does experience an\nincrease in core metabolism,\nyou burn some calories, in other words,\nand while those might not be\nvery significant increases,\nor I should say they can be\nstatistically significant,\nbut they are not enormously large numbers\nof calories burned,\nthe longer lasting effects\nof deliberate cold exposure\non metabolism seem to take\nplace by changes that occur\nin the types of fat that\nwe store in our body\nand the way that that fat\nimpacts our metabolism\nat other times throughout\nthe 24 hour cycle.\nThis actually has a\nsomewhat anecdotal basis,\nin particular in Scandinavia.\nI don't speak Swedish nor I speak Danish,\nnor do I speak Norwegian,\nbut I do have Danish relatives\nand they were able to help me decipher\na common Swedish saying,\nwhich essentially\ntranslates to the fact that\nin preparation for the summer, they say,\none should expose themselves\nto warm environments\nso that one is comfortable\nin warm environments\nin the summer.\nThat's one half of this\ntraditional Swedish\nand also Danish saying.\nThe other half of this\ntraditional Danish-Swedish saying\nis that in preparation for winter,\nin order to not feel too\ncold in cold environments,\none should prepare for those in the fall\nby not wearing a jacket\nand exposing one's self\nto cold environments.\nNow, of course, this is just\nanecdotal cultural lore,\nbut it actually has a physiological basis,\nwhich is by exposing\noneself to cold environments\non a repeated basis in\nanticipation of exposure\nto more extreme cold environments,\none can feel more comfortable\nin those extreme cold environments.\nAnd that's exactly what they observed\nin this study by Søberg et al.\nThe men felt more\ncomfortable in extreme cold\nif they had trained through\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nwhich might not seem surprising at all,\nbut based on what we talked about earlier,\nwhereby deliberate cold\nexposure evokes this discomfort\nand this experience of\nnorepinephrine release,\nat least in the short term,\nthen you would say, well,\nshouldn't that deliberate\ncold exposure also\nmake them feel uncomfortable\nlike they really want to get out?\nWell, that is true\nin the beginning of a deliberate\ncold exposure protocol,\nmeaning in the first week\nor in the second week\nor the third week, but what one finds\nand what you will find if you do\ndeliberate cold exposure\nconsistently is that you will then\nbecome more comfortable\nat cold temperatures\naway from the deliberate cold exposure.\nSo whereas you might have\npreviously been the person\nwho is always cold in the\nroom with air conditioning,\nor always seeking a sweater,\nalways wanting to bundle up,\nyou will be more comfortable\nin those cold environments.\nAnd the reason for that\nis well substantiated\nfrom this study and from animal studies\nwhereby deliberate cold exposure\nconverts one particular kind of fat cell,\nthe white fat cell,\nwhich is a very low metabolic output cell.\nIt's basically a storage site for energy\nin the body fat cells to a\ndifferent type of fat cell,\nwhich is the beige fat cell called beige\nbecause it's actually\nbeige or slightly brown\nunder the microscope, or\neven to brown fat cells,\nwhich are very dark under\nthe microscope and dark\nbecause they contain mitochondria\nand are very metabolically\nand thermogenetically active.\nIn other words, white fat\ndoesn't burn many calories.\nIt's basically a storage site.\nIt's a bank account for energy.\nIt's filled with lipids,\nand those lipids can be used\nif the body needs energy\nand if it goes into a caloric deficit.\nBeige fat and brown fat\nacts as sort of a furnace\nor the sort of fat that\nyou would find in a kindle,\na fuel that can increase\ncore body temperature.\nSo beige fat and brown fat is very good\nat raising our metabolism\nand helps burn white fat.\nNow of course,\nit does that only in the\ncontext of a caloric deficit,\nbut it can actually help\ncreate that caloric deficit.\nHaving more beige fat and brown fat\ncan increase your overall core\nmetabolism, in other words,\nthe number of calories\nthat you burn per day,\nand therefore the number of calories\nthat you need to either\nmaintain or to lose weight.\nThe simple translation of\nthis is that getting into\ncold water for a total of\n11 minutes, perhaps more,\nbut at least 11 minutes per week\ndivided into two or four sessions\ncan increase your core metabolism in part\nby increasing your beige\nand brown fat stores.\nAnd we know how that works\nat least in animal models\nand there's now reason to suspect\nthat the exact same mechanisms\nare occurring in humans.\nThe primary way in which\ndeliberate cold exposure converts\nwhite fat cells into\nthese more metabolically\nthermogenetically active\nmetabolism increasing\nbeige and brown fat cells\nis because norepinephrine\nreleased when we get into\nthe cold binds to receptors\non the surface of white\nfat cells and activates\ndownstream pathways such as UCP1,\nso this is an uncoupling protein one,\nthat acts on the mitochondrial\nmetabolism of cells\nand increases the mitochondrial\noutput of those cells\nand the mitochondrial\ndensity of those cells.\nIn other words,\nit takes a cell that has\na kind of a weak engine\nor no engine for generating energy.\nAlthough every cell has some mitochondria,\nit takes cells that have\nvery few mitochondria\nand increases the engine size.\nIt kind of stokes the furnace\nof those particular cells\nand actually can change gene\nexpression in those cells.\nSo that's what's really interesting.\nDeliberate cold exposure causes\nincreases in norepinephrine.\nwhich bind to receptors on the\nsurfaces of white fat cells,\nwhich triggers the release\nof things like UCP1.\nIt also causes the release\nof things like P-part gamma,\nand co-factor PGC1.\nI'm going to refer you to a review\nif you want to learn more about these.\nFor those of you that\ndon't want to learn more,\nall you need to know is that\nthe downstream of all that\nare increases in\nmitochondria and metabolism\nand actual genetic changes\nin the white fat cells\nthat convert them into\nbeige and brown fat cells.\nThis is especially important for adults\nbecause babies and young\nchildren actually don't have\nthe ability to shiver\nor they have a less\nrobust capacity to shiver.\nVery small babies really can't shiver\nso they have a lot of brown\nfat in order to keep them warm.\nYoung children eventually\ndevelop the ability to shiver\nand maintain these brown fat stores,\nmainly around the clavicles,\nthe heart, the upper spine,\nand in the upper back.\nAnd it's no coincidence that\nkids can often run around\nwith a minimal of clothing\nand be comfortable\nin environments that\nadults would be cold in.\nAs life goes on, we tend to\nlose beige and brown fat,\nbut this mechanism that I'm referring to\npoints to the plasticity of white fat,\nmeaning the ability for\nwhite fat to actually convert\nits identity into this\nmetabolically thermogenetically\nenhancing form of beige and brown fat.\nSo deliberate cold\nexposure is a terrific way\nto increase your core metabolism\nand oftentimes critics will say, well,\nthe increase in metabolism\nisn't that significant\nalthough I do want to point out again,\nthe 93% and 350% increases in metabolism\nfrom that previous study.\nBut critics then will say, well,\nthat doesn't really translate\nto that big of a caloric burn\nduring the deliberate cold exposure.\nBut to that, you should say, ah,\nbut that's only limiting your optics\nto just a portion of the effects\nof deliberate cold exposure\nbecause deliberate cold exposure\ncan also convert white fat\nto beige fat and brown fat\nand lead to these more lasting\nincreases in metabolism.\nSo for any of you interested\nin increasing your metabolism\nand or being comfortable\nin cold environments\nand or being comfortable in terms of\nbeing able to combat stress mentally,\ndeliberate cold exposure, I\ndo believe is a powerful tool.\nAnd there is simply no reason\nwhy you couldn't and shouldn't\nuse the same protocols\nthat I described earlier\nfor building resilience\nto increase metabolism.\nProvided you're hitting that\n11 minute per week threshold,\nyou ought to be stimulating\nboth mechanism increases\nin resilience and increases\nin core metabolism.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nmost of the detailed studies\non the conversion of white fat\nto beige fat and brown fat\nthrough the use of cold\nhave been done in animal models,\nbut the human data are starting to emerge.\nAnd if you'd like to do the\ndeep dive into these mechanisms,\nthings like UCP1, P-part gamma, et cetera,\nthere's a beautiful review\nthat was published recently\nin the journal cell,\nwhich is one of the three apex journals,\nnature, science, cell.\nAnd the title of that paper\nis adipose tissue plasticity\nin health and disease.\nI love this review.\nIt has beautiful diagrams\ndetailing all of the pathways\nfrom cold to norepinephrine through UCP1\ndownstream of things like cyclic AMP.\nIf none of those names\nmean anything to you,\ndon't worry about it.\nYou certainly don't need\nto know these mechanisms\nto benefit from deliberate\ncold exposure protocols.\nIf those names do mean something to you,\nor you are interested in\nexploring the downstream effects\nof deliberate cold\nexposure and something else\nthat's really nice that's\ncovered in this paper\nis how deliberate cold exposure interacts\nwith fasted states and fed states.\nI think you'll also find\nthis review very interesting.\nI don't want to go too\ndeeply into fasted states\nand fed states right now,\nsuffice to say that when we are fasted,\nmeaning when we have an eaten\nfor some period of time,\nour baseline levels of norepinephrine\nand epinephrine are already elevated.\nAnd so cold exposure at those times\nought to have an even\ngreater effect on metabolism\nand resilience and so on.\nSo for you fasters or your\nintermittent fasters out there,\nif you really want to get fancy,\nyou can do your deliberate cold exposure\nwhen you are fasted.\nI certainly wouldn't recommend doing it\nwith a very full stomach in any case.\nAnd as I mentioned before on this podcast,\nintermittent fasting is, but one way,\nand certainly there are other ways\nto limit total caloric intake\nfor sake of maintaining\nor losing weight if that's your goal.\nI know many people are using and benefit\nfrom intermittent fasting, however,\nand so it certainly can be combined\nwith deliberate cold exposures in order\nto get even greater increases\nin norepinephrine and epinephrine.\nSo for those of you that\nare primarily interested\nin using deliberate cold exposure\nto increase dopamine levels\nin your brain and body,\nyou can also do a combined protocol\nwhereby you ingest\ncaffeine 60 to 120 minutes\nbefore the deliberate cold exposure.\nThis is based on a study\nthat I've talked about before\nentitled caffeine increases\nstriatal dopamine D-2,\nD-3 receptor availability\nin the human brain.\nAnd as the title suggests,\nthis study was done on humans,\nlooking at the density and or efficacy\nof these dopamine receptors\nin an area of the brain\ncalled the striatum,\nwhich is involved in planning in action\nand also suppressing planning in action.\nIt's involved very closely\nwith whether or not\nwe can engage in behavior\nand withhold behavior,\nthe so-called go and no\ngo ways in the brain.\nDopamine plays a critical role in that\nand many other things\nas well as you now know.\nSo why would you want to ingest\ncaffeine 60 to 120 minutes\nbefore deliberate cold exposure?\nWell, as I talked about earlier,\ndopamine can increase quite substantially\nin response to deliberate cold exposure,\nbut dopamine on its own\ndoesn't do anything,\nit has to bind to receptors\nand this paper shows quite definitively\nthat ingesting caffeine in this case,\nit was 300 milligram dose of caffeine,\nwhich is about the dose of caffeine\nin two or three cups of coffee,\nit depends on the strength\nof the coffee, of course,\nbut it's not an outrageous\namount of caffeine,\nthat increases the density and or efficacy\nof these receptors,\nwhich you would allow that dopamine\nto have its greatest effect.\nAnd for those of you that want\nto get really, really fancy,\nI suppose you could do this fasted\nso you get the further\nincrease in norepinephrine,\nthen you get the dopamine\nincrease from the cold exposure,\nthe binding of the dopamine.\nAlthough I do want to point\nout that at some point,\nyou start layering\ntogether enough protocols\nthat you would to be\nspending your entire day\ntrying to get this dopamine pulse\nand I would hope that you\nwould have other activities\nthat you would engage in,\nbut if you're getting up in\nthe morning and you're fasted\nbecause you haven't eaten all night\nand you have a cup of coffee,\nand then 60 minutes later,\nyou take your cold shower\nor two hours later,\nyou do your cold immersion\nor your cold shower,\nyou would be layering together\nthese different mechanisms\nof dopamine receptors,\nepinephrine and so forth in\na way that at least to me,\ndoesn't seem incompatible\nwith having some other life\nlike going to school and having\nrelationships, et cetera.\nAnd this increase in dopamine,\nparticularly in the striatum\nis not a trivial one.\nI do want to point out as the authors do\nthat preclinical studies have shown\nthat increases in striatal dopamine\ninduced by things like modafinil,\nwhich is used to treat\nADHD and treat narcolepsy,\nis necessary for their\nwake promoting actions.\nWhat this really says is that\njust having elevated levels\nof dopamine from a drug\nor from an ice bath,\nor what have you is not sufficient\nto get the effects of dopamine,\nyou really need the\nreceptors to be available\nand you need those\nreceptors to be available\nin the appropriate density\nand you need those\nreceptors to be available\nin the appropriate density in\nthe striatum in particular.\nSo I think there are a\nnumber of reasons why\nif it's compatible with the\nother aspects of your health,\ncause of course always\nyou have to consider this\non a background of cardiovascular health\nand blood pressure, et cetera,\nthat ingesting a cup or two of coffee\nan hour before your ice\nbath may be fasted as well\ncould be quite beneficial\nfor increasing dopamine\nover quite extended periods of time.\nA couple of key points that\nyou'll want to pay attention to\nin thinking about deliberate\ncold exposure and metabolism.\nIn the Søberg study,\nthey also explored the use of\nsauna and how to use sauna,\nmeaning deliberate heat\nin conjunction with cold.\nWe are going to do an entire\nepisode about the use of heat\nfor health and performance.\nSo that is not the focus now, however,\nit does raise an important point\nthat we do need to address at this moment,\nwhich is if you are using sauna\nor if you are taking warm showers\nor if you are simply using\ndeliberate cold exposure\nof any kind,\nshould you get into the heat afterward\nor before or not at all?\nAnd this is where we can\npoint to the so-called\nSøberg principle, at least I\ncall it the Søberg principle,\nthe Søberg principle named after\nfirst author of this study,\nI referred to earlier, Dr. Susanna Søberg.\nIn science, it is appropriate\nto take a key piece of data\nand call it a principle\nif in fact it translates\nto something larger,\nwhich I believe it does.\nIt is generally not appropriate for people\nto name a principle after themselves\nalthough there are a few\nscientists that have done that.\nSo I have named it the Søberg principle,\nbut I did that to give\nit appropriate credit\nto Dr. Susanna Søberg,\nwho discovered that and pointed\nout quite appropriately,\nthat to achieve the greatest\nincreases in metabolism\nthrough deliberate cold exposure,\nyou want to force yourself\nto reheat on your own\nafter the deliberate cold exposure,\nmeaning you wouldn't want\nto go from the cold shower\nto a hot shower or from\nthe cold shower to a sauna.\nRather if you were going\nto start with a hot shower\nor you're going to start with a sauna\nthat you would end with the cold,\nand then you would reheat naturally.\nNow I personally take a cold\nshower a few times a week\nor do cold immersion\nand because I'm not specifically focused\non increasing metabolism,\nalthough I probably should be,\nthat's not what I'm using it for now,\nI will take a hot shower\nafterwards and in doing so,\nI'm short circuiting\nsome of the further metabolic\nincreases that I would achieve\nwere I to just end with the cold.\nSo the Søberg principle is\nif you want to increase your\nmetabolism, end with cold,\nand we can take this\na step further and say\nthat if you want to use\ndeliberate cold exposure\nto increase metabolism,\nthat you should make sure\nthat you get to the\npoint where you shiver.\nAnd the reason in for\nthis is that there are\na series of studies, but in particular,\none study published in the journal Nature,\nexcellent journal in the year 2018,\nshowing that deliberate cold\nexposure that evokes shivering\nfrom the muscles causes\nthe release of a molecule\ncalled succinate from the muscles\nand that succinate plays\na key role in activating\nbrown fat thermogenesis,\nwhich you now have heard\nabout and understand\nas critical to the increases in metabolism\ncaused by deliberate cold exposure.\nSo what this means is if you want to\nincrease your metabolism, end on cold,\nthat's a Søberg principle\nand as best you can,\ntry and get to the point\nwhere you are shivering\neither when you are in the cold exposure\nor immediately afterwards.\nNow one efficient way to do\nthis is to, for instance,\nyou could get into the\ncold shower for a minute\nor two minutes or three\nminutes, uncomfortably cold,\nbut safe to stay in.\nRemember that's our general rule of thumb.\nThen turn off the water and stand there,\nmake sure that you're not holding yourself\nclose to your body,\nyou're not hugging yourself\nto try and keep yourself warm,\nbut rather your limbs are\nextended at your sides.\nAnd then if that fails to induce shiver\nthan to turn on the cold water again,\nand then turn it off again,\nso alternating perhaps a\nminute to three minutes\nof cold exposure followed\nby a minute to three minutes\nof drying out in air\nand going back into the\ncold exposure, et cetera.\nI can tell you this from experience,\nthis is a pretty brutal protocol.\nIf you have never tried\ngetting into an ice bath\nor cold water immersion\nor shower for one minute\nand then getting out and\ntrying to stand there\nwith your arms extended in cool\nor cold air for one minute,\nand then getting back into the cold shower\nor water immersion, you are\nin for an experience because\neven for those of you that\nare pretty shiver resistant,\nyou'll find that it is much, much harder\nto get out of that cold water\nand stand there arms extended\nand drying off by evaporation,\nwhich further draws heat from the body\nthan it is to wrap yourself in a towel,\nget in a warm shower or a sauna.\nSo there's certainly no\nrequirement to end on cold.\nThere's certainly no\nrequirement to induce shiver,\nbut if your primary goal\nis to induce increases in metabolism,\nboth in the short term\nand in the long term,\nfollowing the cold exposure,\nwell then you'll want to end on cold\nand you'll want to find a way to shiver\nprovided that the level of cold\nthat you're exposing yourself to\nis still safe for you overall.\nSo up until now,\nI've been talking about\ndeliberate cold exposure\nas a potent stimulus for the\nrelease of norepinephrine\nin the brain and body and indeed it is,\nbut the way I've been describing\nit has been in the context\nof circulating plasma\nlevels of norepinephrine,\nmeaning circulating within the blood.\nWhat I haven't mentioned,\nbut is absolutely true is\nthat the fat cells themselves\nactually receive input from neurons.\nSo there are neurons that\nrelease norepinephrine\nin response to cold,\ndirectly into the fat.\nSo I want to give you this\npicture of how the architecture\nof all this works,\nbecause I think it can help you navigate\nand indeed build better deliberate\ncold exposure protocols.\nYour adrenal glands release\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nYour brain has sites within\nit like the locus coeruleus\nthat release norepinephrine\nand epinephrine,\nbut there are also neurons\nwithin your skin that sense cold\nand other neurons that can\ndirectly release norepinephrine\ninto the fat stores and\ncause those white fat cells\nto convert to beige and brown fat.\nAnd I think this particular\naspect of our physiology\nis often overlooked in studies.\nAnd when people say, oh,\nwell the increases in\nmetabolism aren't that great,\nthe circulating levels of norepinephrine,\nthose are very large, but\nthey're very transient and so on,\nthat fails to understand that neurons\nthat actually sense cold are\nin a position to communicate\nvia other neurons\ndirectly to the fat cells\nand release norepinephrine\ninto those fat cells,\nwhich as I pointed out earlier,\nset off a huge set of immediate\nand long term cascades of\neven gene expression changes.\nSo the picture that I'd like\nyou to have in your mind\nis that when you get into the cold, yes,\nof course you experience\nthat as a experience of\nI don't want to do this,\nI'm going to overcome this,\nI'm going to climb over these mental walls\nthat represent adrenaline\nrelease in my brain and body,\nbut also that your fat\ncells are receiving signals,\nnorepinephrine signals that\nare changing those fat cells\nand the way that they metabolize energy.\nNow I'd like to shift\nour attention to the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nfor sake of physical performance.\nAnd there are a lot of opinions out there\nabout the use of deliberate cold,\nwhether or not it should\nbe done for instance,\nbefore or after exercise,\nwhether or not if done immediately\nafter strength training\nor hypertrophy training,\nmeaning training designed to grow muscles\nor make them stronger,\nwhether or not it can inhibit that process\nand so on and so forth.\nI think today in looking\nover the literature\nand trying to bring forward the simplest\nand most straightforward,\nand yet scientifically grounded protocols,\nwe can set up some general\nguidelines that will allow most,\nif not, all of you to\nstill extract the benefits\nof deliberate cold exposure\non physical performance\nwithout getting too neurotic\nabout the exact timing,\nbut for sake of discussion\nand because it's a prominent theme\nin many online communities,\nlet's just start with\nthe big one out there,\nmeaning the question of whether\nor not doing an ice bath\nor doing deliberate cold\nexposure or taking a cold shower\nafter strength slash hypertrophy training,\nmeaning training designed\nto increase strength\nand or I should say the size of muscles\nwill somehow short circuit\nor diminish that process,\nwhether or not it will reduce or eliminate\nthose strength gains\nand hypertrophy gains.\nAnd the short answer that\nI was able to arrive at\non the basis of a review\narticle that I'll talk about\nin a moment and some\nother studies as well,\nis that if your main goal\nis hypertrophy and strength,\nit is probably best to\navoid cold water immersion\nand ice bath immersion in the four hours\nimmediately following that strength\nand or hypertrophy training.\nAgain, if your main goal\nis to achieve hypertrophy\nor strength or some combination of those,\nprobably best to avoid cold\nwater immersion up to the neck\nor ice bath immersion up to the neck\nimmediately after strength\nand hypertrophy training\nand extending out to about\nfour hours after that training.\nIf you're really neurotic about this,\nthen perhaps you'd want to\nmove the cold water exposure\nto a different day entirely,\nbut it all depends on how\nneurotically attached you are\nto getting every last bit\nof strength and hypertrophy.\nAnd if that's your goal, terrific,\nwell then probably moving\nthe cold exposure four hours\nor more away from that training\nis going to be necessary for you.\nNow you'll notice I did\nnot talk about cold showers\nand the reason I did not\ntalk about cold showers\nis that there simply are\nnot very many studies\nof deliberate cold exposure\nthrough cold showers\nfor the reasons I talked about\nat the beginning of the episode.\nIt's hard for me to imagine\nthat taking a brief cold shower\nafter a strength or\nhypertrophy training session\nwould completely reverse or\nshort circuit the effects\nof that strength and hypertrophy training.\nBut again, if you're neurotically attached\nto getting every last bit\nof strength and hypertrophy\nout of your training\nsessions, then by all means,\nerr on the side of caution\nand wait four hours or more\nto do your cold shower just\nas you would wait four hours\nor more to do your cold water immersion.\nNow there are nice data\npointing to the fact\nthat doing cold water\nimmersion after a hard run,\nso endurance training,\nor even sprint and interval training\nor after a weight workout\nwhere your main focus\nis on performance of those movements\nor after a skill training workout\nwhere your main focus on\nperformance of those movements,\nthat there's no reason to think that that\ncold water immersion or\nice bath or cold shower\nwould inhibit the progress or the stimulus\nthat would lead to progress\nthat occurred during\nthat training session.\nIn other words, I don't see any reason\nbased on the literature to\navoid deliberate cold exposure\nimmediately after training,\nagain unless your goal is\nhypertrophy and strength.\nAnd in fact,\nthere's a very nice\nreview recently published\non deliberate cold exposure\nand how it can impact\nphysical performance,\nwhether or not it's done before or after,\ndifferent types of training and so forth.\nThe paper is entitled impact\nof cold water immersion\ncompared with passive recovery,\nfollowing a single about\nof strenuous exercise\non athletic performance in\nphysically active participants,\na systematic review with\nmeta-analysis and meta regression.\nSo this is a meta-analysis of 52 studies\nthat looked at a tremendous\nnumber of variables\nand contexts, as you would\nexpect in a meta-analysis\nof 52 studies.\nI'm going to read you the\nconclusions of the study\nand I will provide a link.\nWe certainly don't have\nthe time to go through\nall the details of the study.\nI will highlight a few specific outcomes\nthat I found particularly interesting,\nbut here I am paraphrasing\ntheir conclusions,\nthat cold water immersion, I\nwant to emphasize immersion,\nnot cold showers, but cold water immersion\nthey say was an effective recovery tool\nafter high intensity exercise.\nThey observed positive outcomes,\nmeaning improvements in certain variables,\nfor muscular power, muscular soreness,\nmeaning reduced muscular soreness,\nincreased muscular power,\nperceived recovery after\n24 hours of exercise.\nHowever, there were\ncertain forms of exercise\nthat were not benefited\nby cold water immersion,\nsuch as eccentric exercise,\nexercise focusing only\non the lowering component\nor the so-called eccentric\ncomponent of resistance exercise.\nThey saw some very entry\ndose response relationships\nfor things like endurance\ntraining, meaning the longer\nthe cold exposure post-endurance training,\nthe more improvement in\nendurance performance,\nreductions in circulating creatine kinases\nand things that relate to muscle damage\nunder certain conditions.\nAt some point in the future, by the way,\nwe'll do an entire episode on\ncreatine and creatine kinase,\nwhich are important not\njust for muscular function,\nbut also for brain function.\nBut the basic takeaway was\nthat cold water immersion\nperformed after high intensity exercise\nwas beneficial from a number\nof different standpoints\nand indicated that shorter duration,\ncold exposure and lower temperatures\ncan improve the efficacy\nof cold water exposure\nif used after high intensity exercise.\nThere I'm directly pulling\nfrom their conclusions.\nSo what this says is\nthat it's not just those\nlonger duration, 30, 45\nminute and 60 minute protocols\nof cold water immersion\nthat we discussed earlier,\nbut also shorter duration\nof one minute, three minute,\nfive minute exposures\nto lower temperatures.\nTemperatures that would\nmake you psychologically\nwant to get out as soon\nas you possibly can,\nbut again that you can safely stay in\ndone after training\nreally have been shown to\nimprove outcomes in terms\nof reducing soreness\nand improving training efficacy,\nmeaning your ability to get\nback into training more quickly\nand thereby deliver more training stimuli\nto a given muscle or in your\nendurance training protocol.\nTranslate to English,\nwhat this means is that taking\na cold shower or getting into\nan ice bath or some other\nform of cold water immersion\nwithin the immediate minutes\nor even the immediate hours\nfollowing your training has\nbeen shown to be beneficial.\nI'm sure a number of you\nhave questions for instance,\nhow long should you be\nin that cold exposure?\nIs it the same as the 11 minute\nthreshold described earlier?\nTo be honest with you,\nthere are not enough\nstudies to really point\nto the critical threshold for eliminating\nor reducing delayed onset muscle soreness\nor for getting maximal results from power\nand endurance training,\nbut this study does make\na couple of key points\nand here I will just paraphrase.\nFor instance, that cold water immersion\nis more likely to positively influence\nmuscular power performance,\nto reduce muscle soreness, to\nreduce serum creatine kinase,\nand to improve perceived recovery\nafter high intensity exercise,\nas compared with passive recovery.\nThis can be translated to cold\nwater exposure after training\nis beneficial and probably better\nthan passive recovery from\na number of standpoints.\nIn addition, they say that\ndose response relationships\nmeaning the amount and the degree of cold\nthat people were exposed to\nand how often they did that\nin particular in lower\ntemperature cold immersion.\nSo these would be the sorts\nof cold immersion protocols\nthat are one minute or two\nminutes, three minutes,\nmaybe five minutes,\nbut that one couldn't stay in there longer\nbecause it feels stressful\nand one wants to get out.\nMaybe more effective after\nhigh intensity exercise\nfor removal of serum creatine kinase\nas well that these shorter duration\ncold water immersion approaches\nmay be more effective\nafter high intensity\nendurance performance as well.\nSo all of this can be\ntranslated to say that\nunless your main goal is\nhypertrophy and strength,\nthat cold exposure, ideally cold immersion\nand cold water ice bath,\nbut if you don't have access to that,\nthen cold showers is likely\ngoing to be beneficial\nif done immediately\nafter or in the minutes\nor hours after your training,\nespecially high intensity training.\nOne particularly nice thing\nabout this meta-analysis\nis that it included some studies that\ninvolve the use of cooling packs.\nSo again, vests that can\nessentially ice packs\nand indeed even cryotherapy\nchambers and so on.\nThere's a nice table in the study\nif you want to get really detailed and go\nand look specifically at those studies,\nI invite you to do that.\nWe'll put a link to this\nstudy in the caption\nfor this episode, but all in all,\nwhat this study shows is\nthat deliberate cold exposure\ncan be very useful for recovery\nlikely through reductions\nin inflammation, in muscle\nand connective tissue.\nAnd while this study did\nnot look specifically\nat the mechanisms of reduced inflammation\ncaused by deliberate cold exposure,\nthose mechanisms are somewhat known.\nThere are a number of studies\nthat have pointed to the fact\nthat deliberate cold and cold generally\ncan reduce inflammatory cytokines,\nsuch as IL-6, interleukin six.\nIt can increase\nanti-inflammatory cytokines\nsuch as interleukin 10 and so on.\nWithout getting into all those details,\nI think it's sufficient to say that\nif you are somebody who experiences\na lot of delayed onset muscle soreness,\ntaking a cold shower after your training\nor getting into a cold\nimmersion after your training,\neven if it's a few hours\nlater ought to help.\nAnd if you are doing\nparticularly intense training,\nthen you probably want\nto ratchet up the number\nof cold exposure sessions\nthat you're doing\neven if those have to\nbe done on separate days\nfrom your training,\nbecause a lot of the\ninflammatory effects of training,\nendurance and strength\ntraining are actually occurring\nsome hours away from\nthe training stimulus.\nSo it's not just that inflammation goes up\nradically during training,\nwhich it often can,\nbut that it can occur even in the days\nand even weeks afterwards,\ndepending how intense\nand how long duration\nthat training is.\nSo deliberate cold\nexposure is very powerful\nas an anti-inflammatory tool.\nNow I'd like to emphasize\nthe topic that we touched on\nat the beginning of the episode,\nwhich are those glabrous skin surfaces,\nthe hands, the upper face,\nand the bottoms of the\nfeet through which heat\nis especially good at leaving the body.\nAnd another way of putting\nthat is that one can cool\nthe body much more efficiently\nthrough the glabrous skin surfaces.\nNow, if you want to\nunderstand all of the science\nbehind this and all of\nthe various applications,\nI invite you to please\nlisten to the episode\nthat I did with Dr. Craig Heller, again,\nin the biology department at Stanford.\nFor sake of this episode,\nI'm just going to detail\na couple of findings\nfrom his laboratory.\nThe first one, dealing with\nexercise induced hyperthermia,\nbecause I think this is very interesting\nand it can even save lives\nif you understand the way this works.\nThere's a particular paper\nthat focuses on this,\nand we will put a link to this as well.\nThe title of this paper\nis novel application\nof chemical cold packs for treatment\nof exercise induced hyperthermia,\na randomized control trial.\nThis is a pretty brutal study,\nbrutal for the subjects that is.\nThis study involved was having\nsubjects walk on a treadmill\nat a pretty significant\nincline and anywhere\nfrom nine to 17% wearing a\nsubstantial amount of clothing\nthat was not well ventilated\nand the room was kept\nto 40 degrees Celsius,\nwhich is 104 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThis is definitely not\nsomething to do at home.\nThis study was designed\nto induce hyperthermia,\nwhich as I mentioned earlier,\ncan be quite dangerous.\nAnd they compared two types of cooling.\nIn the first form of cooling\nthat they call traditional cooling,\nthey had ice packs on their neck,\nin their armpits and in their groin.\nAnd in the other group,\nthere was the so-called\nglabrous skin cooling.\nSo the palms, the soles of the feet,\nwhich were actually so they\nwere cooling inside the boots\nor inside of gloves and on\nthe upper portion of the face.\nAnd the basic takeaway of this study\nis that by cooling the glabrous skin,\nthe subjects were able\nto sustain this walking\non these inclined\ntreadmills for much longer\nthan were the people who\nreceived traditional cooling.\nAnd also the return to\nbaseline temperature\nwas much faster in the\nglabrous skin cooling group.\nSo how this translates to the real world\nis that if ever you are hyperthermic\nor someone else's hyperthermic,\none way to cool them\ndown quickly is to cool\nthese palmer glabrous,\nsoles of the feet glabrous\nand upper portion of the face\nglabrous portions of the body\nusing cool rags, using ice\npacks or using any number\nof different cold objects or temperatures.\nOne key thing, if you're going\nto use glabrous skin cooling,\nis that whatever you use\nto cool those surfaces\ncannot be so cold that it\ncauses vasoconstriction.\nBecause as I mentioned earlier,\nthe arterio-venous anastomoses\nthese portals of arteries\ndirectly to veins\nthat exist only in these\nglabrous skin surfaces,\nthe way that they're able to cool the body\nand essentially pass cool into the body\nalthough that's not\nreally what they're doing,\nthey're actually extracting\nheat from the body\nto be technical, they're\nextracting heat from the body,\nthe only way they can do\nthat is if those veins\ndon't collapse and veins will collapse\nif they are made very, very cold.\nSo if you want to use\nglabrous skin cooling\nto offset hyperthermia\nor for the other forms of performance,\nwhich we'll talk about in a moment,\nyou need to use a cool object or surface\nthat is not so cold that\nit causes vasoconstriction.\nAnd this can be a little\nbit tough to dial in,\nmeaning it can be tough to\nidentify such an object.\nAnd for that reason,\nDr. Heller and some of his\ncolleagues have developed\na commercial product called the CoolMitt.\nYou can actually go to\ntheir website, coolmitt.com.\nI don't have any financial or\nother relationship to them.\nI know they've been\ndeveloping this technology\nfor some period of time.\nIt involves a glove that\nyou put your hand into,\nit circulates water of a given\ntemperature and it does so,\nand does so at a tempera\nor that is sure to not\ncause vasoconstriction of the palm.\nAnd you may be asking,\nhow can you just put\nyour hand into one glove\nand have this work?\nWell, that's how powerful these\nglabrous skin surfaces are.\nEven just by cooling one palm,\nthe core body temperature drops radically.\nNow that's their commercial technology.\nI know that some people out\nthere have started to experiment\nwith a home version of this,\nwhich would be taking\na package for instance\nof frozen blueberries\nor some other cold drink\nor cold metal object, and\nactually bringing it into the gym\nor out on a run.\nThere are even people\nwho are now developing\ncooled psych bicycle\nhandles for long rides.\nThis might seem a little\nkooky or crazy to you,\nbut as you'll soon hear in the study\nI'm about to describe,\nthe increases in endurance\nand in the volume of strength training\nthat people can conduct\nif they appropriately cool\ntheir body through these\nglabrous skin portals\nis actually quite significant.\nSo again, as it relates to hyperthermia,\nif someone is overheating by all means,\ntry and get them out of that heat,\nget them to stop exercising,\nyou can die from hyperthermia,\ntry and cool the bottoms of the feet,\nthe palms of their hands\nand the upper portion of their face.\nThat does not mean it would be a bad idea\nto put cold water on\nthe top of their head.\nThat probably would also help\nand perhaps on their neck.\nWhat is probably not going\nto be a good idea is to do\nthe more standard thing of\ndraping someone in cold towels\non the surface of their\nbody because as I mentioned,\nthe beginning of the episode,\nthat thermostat in the hypothalamus,\nthe medial preoptic area\nwill typically react to that\nby increasing core body\ntemperature further.\nThe effects of glabrous skin\ncooling on physical performance\nare truly remarkable\nprovided the glabrous skin\ncooling is done correctly.\nAnd I want to point out that\nthe main degree of effect\nis on volume or the\nability to do more work.\nAnd I want to point this out\nbecause I think that many people,\ncertainly in the exercise\nscience community,\nbut even in the general public,\nwhen they hear about some of these effects\nthat are measured in the laboratory,\nthey sort of look at those\neffects a bit of scans\nand they think, well, that's not possible.\nEffects for instance,\nthat have been documented\nshowing doubling or tripling\nof the number of dips\nthat one can do in a\nrelatively short amount of time\nor doubling of the number\nof pullups one can do\nor 14% increases in strength\nor even comparable degrees\nin increase in weight training output\nto people who are on\nperformance enhancing drugs,\net cetera, et cetera.\nPart of the confusion is that the effects\nof proper palmer cooling,\nbecause it almost always\nis done by palmer cooling\nand less often in these experiments\nby cooling of the bottoms of the feet\nand the upper portion of the face,\nbut those effects tend to be\nthe ability to do more work\nover time and just to illustrate\nsome of the major effects\nthat the Heller lab is seen\nand they are document\nentered in this manuscript\nthat I'll share with you in a moment.\nThe typical protocol is\nto have people come in\nand do some endurance training\nso running on a treadmill\nand to have a condition where\none group is actually doing palmer cooling\nwhile they are on a bike or on a treadmill\nand inevitably the outcome is\nthat they can do more work.\nThey can pedal further at a given speed,\nor they can run longer at\na given speed than people\nwho are not doing palmer cooling\nor who are receiving cooling by way of\ncold compress to the back\nof the neck or ice pack\nto the armpits, et cetera.\nSo the effects of palmer\ncooling are very clear\nand very robust.\nAnd in the context of endurance exercise\nalmost always allow\npeople to do more work,\nto go longer with less perceived\neffort and to quit later\nso to speak.\nIn terms of strength training,\nthey've looked at the capacity\nto perform sets of dips.\nSo one of the more famous examples of this\nthat Dr. Heller shares in the\nepisode that we did earlier,\nand that you can find at\nhubermanlab.com involves\nsomeone coming in and doing\nsets of dips, maybe 40 dips.\nThis person actually could do\n40 dips on their first set,\nthen resting for a period\nof two to three minutes\nand then doing 35\nand then resting for a period\nof two or three minutes,\nand then doing progressively\nfewer and fewer and fewer\nto the point where over a period of time,\nthey add up the total number\nof dips that they can do\nand then they have them come back\nafter a period of recovery,\nso not immediately after,\nbut take a couple of days,\ncome back and do effectively\nthe same protocol,\nbut during their rest periods,\nthey're doing two minutes\nof palmer cooling,\nwhich essentially allows\nheat to move out of the body,\nlowering core body\ntemperature in other words.\nAnd what they find is that\nthey see enormous increases\nin the total number of\ndips that people can do,\nbut that doesn't mean that the person goes\nfrom being able to do 40 dips,\nto being able to do 50 dips\nor 60 dips on that first set,\nwhat it means is they are able\nto do 40 on the first set,\nthen 40 on the second,\nthen 38 on the third\nand so on and so forth\nso that the total duration\nof the workout is extended\nand yet they're doing much more work,\neven though it takes more time.\nSo that's an important point\nand I think a point that\nperhaps wasn't as clear\nor as clearly made by me\nin the previous episodes\nthat discuss this topic.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin exploring palmer cooling, first of all,\nI recommend taking a brief\nglance or even a deep dive\ninto this study,\nwhich is entitled work volume\nand strength training\nresponses to resistive exercise\nimprove with periodic heat\nextraction from the palm.\nIn this study, they describe\nbig increases in anaerobic,\nmeaning strength training output,\nthings like improvement in dips,\nimprovement in bench press,\nimprovement in pull-ups, et\ncetera, in human subjects.\nAnd it's a really nice study and points\nto some of the protocols\nthat you might be able\nto adapt in your own setup.\nFor instance, over six\nweeks of pull up training,\npalm cooling in between sets\nimproved volume by 144%,\nand this was in experienced subjects.\nSo that's interesting\nbecause a lot of studies\nof strength training and\nimprovements in hypertrophy\nand strength are done in\ninexperienced untrained athletes,\nwhich changes the picture somewhat\ncompared to experienced athletes.\nThey found that strength,\nmeaning the one repetition maximum,\nincreased 22% over 10 weeks\nin bench press training.\nAnd they point to the\nparticularly strong effects\nof using palmer cooling\nwhen people reach plateaus\nin endurance and strength training.\nAnd there, I think it's\nan important point.\nI think that if you're going\nto explore palmer cooling,\nit's probably not the sort of\nthing that you're going to do\nin every run or in every about of cycling\nor in every strength training session,\nbut that it might be used to\nvastly increase your volume\nor vastly increase your endurance\nin a given session or a set of sessions\nin order to push through plateaus.\nA particularly interesting\npoint in light of that\nis Dr. Heller has observed again and again\nthat palmer cooling reduces\ndelayed onset muscle soreness,\nor it can eliminate it entirely.\nAnd that's very interest because\nit also points to the fact\nthat reducing core body\ntemperature may somehow be involved\nin short circuiting\nthe normal mechanisms of\ndelayed onset muscle soreness.\nAnd you might say, well,\nhow would temperature be involved\nin delayed onset muscle soreness?\nWell, I want to refer you\nback to the meta-analysis\nthat we talked about earlier,\nwhere the short duration,\nvery cold temperature exposure\nafter training did indeed\nreduce delayed onset muscle soreness\nin part through reduction,\nexcuse me, in creatine kinase.\nSo it's not inconceivable that temperature\nand delayed onset muscle\nsoreness are related.\nAnd that raises perhaps\nthe most important point,\nwhich is the way that palmer\ncooling can improve performance\nby way of reducing core\nbody temperature is known\nand that is because when\none engages in exercise\nor muscular output of any kind,\nstrength or endurance exercise,\nthe range of temperatures under\nwhich a muscle can perform\nis actually very narrow.\nThere's an enzyme called pyruvate kinase,\nwhich is critical to muscle contractions\nand pyruvate kinase can only function\nin a very narrow range of temperatures.\nIf that temperature gets too hot,\nmeaning if the muscle heats up locally,\nwhether or not by running\nor cycling or swimming or weightlifting,\nthe ability for that muscle to continue\nto contract is reduced and eventually\nis short circuited completely.\nAnd I think this is a much underexplored\nor at least a much under discussed aspect\nof so-called muscular\nfailure or the failure\nof one to continue to endure in running.\nSo for instance,\nwhen you run as compared to\na bench press or something,\nyou don't stop running\nbecause you can't actually\ncontract the muscles further,\nbut somehow signals about the heating up\nof muscular tissue are\nconveyed to the brain.\nThere's a crosstalk there,\nit's probably bidirectional\nand people stop, they quit.\nThis is the quitting reflex.\nIn strength training, one can\nno longer perform a repetition\nor set of repetitions in part\nbecause of heating up\nof the muscle locally.\nThere are other mechanisms\nas well, of course,\nand I realize that,\nbut what's very clear from the\npalmer cooling work is that\nby simply holding onto a cool object,\nremember not an object so cold\nthat it constricts the\nvessels of the palms\nor constricts the vessels\non the bottoms of the feet,\nbut by holding onto a\nrelatively cool object\nin one or both hands in between\nsets for two minutes or so,\nyou can very efficiently reduce\nyour core body temperature\nand in doing so, reduce the\ntemperature of the muscles\nthat are doing the work,\nincrease the capacity for pyruvate kinase\nto continue to allow\nyour muscles to contract\nand thereby allow you to\ndo more volume of endurance\nand strength training.\nSo a simple protocol that\nDr. Heller passed to me\nis find a relatively cool object.\nSo you could, for instance,\nfill two bottles with cold water,\nmaybe put a few ice cubes in there.\nThis is not exact because\nwe're not talking about\nthe commercial CoolMitt product here,\nwe're talking about an at home version\nor use a pack of frozen\nblueberries or broccoli\nsort of pack of those\nas what he described.\nAnd then in between sets to put your hands\nand ideally you'd put\nthe bottoms of your feet,\nbut that's not always\nfeasible in most gyms\nwhere they won't let you take\noff your shoes and so forth,\nbut to put the palms of your\nhands on that cool surface\nfor a minute or two minutes between sets\nand then returning to your sets of work.\nNow, if you are heating up\nthrough other mechanisms\nlike you're wearing a stocking cap\nand you're in a very warm environment,\nthis might not have as potent effect\nas if you were to do this cooling\nin a more moderate environment,\nwearing lighter clothing, et cetera.\nSo by all means warm\nup to do your exercise,\nlubricate your joints,\nand get into a place where you're\nnot going to injure yourself,\ndoing whatever form of exercise you do.\nBut then if you'd like to\nexplore palmer cooling,\nI know a number of people\nwho've written to me saying\nthey heard about palmer cooling\non the episode with Dr. Heller.\nThey've tried this and they\nsee quite excellent results.\nIt does take some discipline.\nIt's one thing to just\nkind of hang out in the gym\nand play on your phone in between sets.\nIt's another to do deliberate\ncooling with your palms\nor the bottom of your feet\nor the upper portion of your face.\nYou might get some weird looks,\nbut of course you'll be the one\ndoing significantly more volume,\nnot experiencing delayed onset\nmuscle soreness and achieving\nbetter endurance and strength gains\nwere you to do this properly.\nNow as a final topic related to the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nfor improving health\nand performance, I'd like\nto touch on this theme\nthat exists online, on social media,\non YouTube and in various\nfitness communities\nof using deliberate cold\nexposure to the groin,\nin particular to the testicles,\nin order to try and increase testosterone.\nAnd while this might sound really kooky,\nindeed this practice exists.\nIndeed if you were to go onto Amazon,\nthere are actually ice pack underwear\nthat are being marketed for\nsake of increasing testosterone.\nNow, I am not aware of any\nspecific well-controlled studies\nthat show that this indeed works.\nI can imagine based on what I\nknow about the nervous system,\ntestosterone and cold, et cetera,\nthat there are a couple of mechanisms\nby which one might experience\nincreases in testosterone\nas a consequence of\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nFirst off, let me say\nthere is no reason why\nyou would have to apply these ice packs\nin the way that I just described.\nOne could of course take a cold shower.\nOne could of course use cold\nimmersion of various kinds,\nand you're still going\nto get that exposure\nof the groin and the testicles to cold.\nNow I should point out\nthat people do report\nat least anecdotally\nincreases in testosterone\nas a consequence of this practice\nand I have to imagine\nthat they are measuring\ntheir serum testosterone,\nthat they're not just guessing\nthat their testosterone went up.\nIf you know of a study\nexploring this directly,\nplease let me know, put in the\ncomment section on YouTube,\nor even just email me.\nWe have a email that you can\nfind it, hubermanlab.com.\nPlease email me the reference.\nI wasn't able to find a reference,\nbut I can imagine two\nreasonably plausible mechanisms\nby which deliberate cold\nexposure to the groin,\nin particular the testicles,\nwould increase testosterone.\nThe first is somewhat direct,\nwhich is that anytime\nyou cool a body surface,\nthat if it's cold enough,\nyou're going to get vasoconstriction.\nAnd then subsequently you're going to get\na rebound increase in vasodilation,\nmeaning you're going to constrict\nthe blood vessels in that area.\nAnd then after the cold is removed,\nthere's going to be more\nblood flow to that area.\nAnd of course,\nblood flow relates to organ health\nand tissue health generally.\nSo perfusion of that region\nand the gonads to be specific\nwith additional blood,\nyou could imagine in some\nways increasing testosterone,\nthat's reasonably plausible.\nThe other probably more likely mechanism\nrelates to the dopamine\nincreases caused by cold exposure\nthat we talked about earlier.\nAgain, anytime you have a\nsomewhat stressful stimulus,\nbut in particular with cold exposure,\nit seems that the catecholamines,\nnorepinephrine, epinephrine\nand dopamine all increase\nand dopamine is known to be in the pathway\nthat can stimulate testosterone.\nAnd so while there isn't\na direct relationship\nbetween dopamine stimulating testosterone,\nthere is an interesting\npathway way whereby\ndopamine increases can trigger increases\nin things like luteinizing hormone,\nwhich can trigger\nincreases in testosterone\nas well as estrogen for that matter.\nSo I know that there are\na lot of people out there\nthat are interested in\nthe use of cold exposure\nfor increasing testosterone.\nAnd some of those people\nin communities are\nindeed using cold exposure\ndirectly on the gonads,\non the testees in order to do this.\nI'm not certain that that\ndirect contact is necessary.\nAnd in some cases it might\nactually be quite dangerous\nor you at least should be\ncareful in terms of tissues there\nand avoiding damage.\nBut nonetheless, I think\nthat a dopamine impact\non testosterone is very likely\ngiven the 250% increases\nin dopamine that have been observed\nwith cold water immersion and\nall of that points to the fact\nthat cold water immersion\nvery likely increases testosterone,\nbut as a downstream consequence\nof the cold water immersion\neffects on dopamine\nand luteinizing hormone,\nand again there's no reason\nto think that the increases\nin luteinizing hormone would\nalso increase estrogen.\nProbably not to dangerous or levels\nthat one would want to avoid,\nbut I don't think that there's anything\nparticularly specific about cold\nfor inducing testosterone\nand not other hormones.\nI think it's very likely to increases\na number of different hormones.\nI do hope that there will be\na systematic study on this\nin the not too distant future.\nI also hope to not be a subject\nin the cooling of the gonads experiment.\nNow I promise you the last\ntopic was the last topic,\nbut there's one other\nreally important point\nthat I think everyone should be aware of\nif you're going to use\ndeliberate cold exposure.\nAnd that brings us back\nto the very first thing\nthat we discussed today,\nalong the lines of\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nwhich is that your baseline temperature\nis going to be lowest about\ntwo hours before you wake up,\nit's going to increase in the morning\nand as you wake up\nand increase throughout\nthe day and afternoon,\nand then start to drop in the\nevening and come down at night\nas you head to sleep.\nI also want you to remember\nthat if you are to cool\nthe external portion of your\nbody, in particular your torso,\nthe net effect of that is\ngoing to be an increase\nin body temperature.\nSo for many people, not\nall, but for many people,\nif you are going to do\ndeliberate cold exposure,\nyou are going to increase\nyour core body temperature\nand that makes sense\nif you think about how\ndeliberate cold exposure\ncan increase metabolism by\nincreasing thermogenesis.\nWhat that all means is\nthat if you are doing\nyour deliberate cold\nexposure early in the day,\nyou are going to get\nyet a further increase\nin core body temperature\nthat would be associated with wakefulness,\nyour ability to be alert that morning\nor throughout the day and so on.\nIt also means that if you do\nyour deliberate cold exposure\nvery late in the evening, or at night,\nso 6:00 PM, 7:00 PM, 9:00 PM and so on,\nyou are going to increase\nyour core body temperature\nand if you recall,\na decrease in core body temperature\nof one to three degrees\nis not just beneficial,\nbut is necessary in order\nto get into deep sleep\nand remain in deep sleep.\nSo the takeaway from this\nis deliberate cold exposure\ndone properly will increase\nyour core body temperature\nand make you feel more alert.\nSo if you're doing it early in the day,\nthat's probably terrific\ngiven that most of us want\nto be alert during the day.\nHowever, if you do it too late\nin the day, evening or night,\nit can disrupt sleep by way of disrupting\nyour core body temperature.\nNow, the caveat to that is I myself\ntend to do deliberate cold\nexposure early in the day.\nMaybe not first thing in the\nmorning, but mid morning,\nmaybe as late as three\nor four in the afternoon\nin some cases.\nIn the longer days of summer,\nI might do it even later,\nfive or 6:00 PM and have\nno trouble sleeping.\nI have done deliberate cold\nexposure very late at night,\n10:00 PM, 11:00 PM and so on\nas part of a 30 day challenge\nof doing deliberate cold\nexposure every day for 30 days\nand I got sloppy with my timing\nand then in order to not miss a day,\nI would do it at 11 o'clock at night.\nAnd I must say\nI found that I could still\nfall asleep very easily,\neven doing deliberate cold\nexposure very late at night.\nHowever, on those particular\ndays, I was particularly busy\nand so I was particularly\nexhausted when I arrived\nat the deliberate cold exposure\nand I had no trouble falling asleep\nafter doing deliberate cold exposure,\nand then taking a nice warm\nshower and then going to sleep.\nBut I could imagine that\nbecause of the increases\nin core body temperature caused\nby deliberate cold exposure,\nthat were one to do that\ntoo late in the day,\nevening or night that it could\nindeed disrupt your sleep.\nSo my recommendation would be\nfor most people only do\ndeliberate cold exposure\nif you are prepared to be\nfairly alert for the next one\nto four or maybe had been six hours\nfollowing that deliberate cold exposure.\nSo for today's episode,\nas is the case with most episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI covered a lot of material.\nWe talked about mechanisms\nof catecholamines and stress\nand pulsatile release of\nepinephrine, metabolism,\nmental effects, performance,\nglabrous skin cooling\nand on and on and on.\nAnd while the goal of course\nis to make sure that everyone\narrives at specific,\nvery clear mechanistic\nand actionable protocols,\nI do realize that it is an\nimmense amount of information.\nAnd for that reason,\nI've created a list of deliberate\ncold exposure protocols\naimed at improving mental\ntoughness and resilience,\nmood, performance, metabolism,\nreducing inflammation,\nand so on and so forth.\nAll of those have been\ncondensed into succinct form\nand can be found at the Huberman Lab\nNeural Network Newsletter.\nThis is a monthly or\nsemi-monthly newsletter\nthat we release\nthat includes takeaways from\nthe podcast and protocols.\nYou can access those\nas protocols zero cost\nby simply going to hubermanlab.com,\nsigning up for the neural\nnetwork newsletter.\nIt's very easy to do, you\njust supply your email\nand you will receive the newsletter.\nWe do not share your\nemail with anybody else.\nIn fact, we have our\nprivacy policy laid out\non the hubermanlab.com website\nso you can find that\nthere and the protocols\nthat I've designed should\nmake it very straightforward\nfor you to create a set of protocols\nthat you could use with cold\nshowers, with cold immersion,\nwith or without ice in\ncombination with exercise\nspecifically for one goal or another,\nor to accomplish multiple\ngoals simultaneously.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube

Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe talk about supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like sleep and focus\nand other aspects of\nhealth and performance.\nOne issue with the supplement industry\nthat's very serious, however,\nis that these supplement companies simply\ndo not use high quality ingredients\nor the amounts of the ingredients\nthey list on the packaging\ndoes not match what's actually\ncontained in their product.\nFor that reason,\nwe partner with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne supplements\nare known to be of the very\nhighest quality ingredients\nand the very highest degree\nof specificity in terms of\nthe amounts of the ingredients\nthat are listed on the packaging\naccurately match what's\ncontained in their products.\nIf you'd like to see the\nThorne products that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne, that's\nthorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd there, you can see the Thorne products\nthat I take and get 20%\noff any of those products.\nIn addition, if you navigate\ndeeper into the Thorne site,\nthrough that portal, Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other products\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nsubscribed to Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\nThere I cover science\nand science related tools\nthat sometimes overlap with\nthe content of the podcast,\nbut oftentimes is distinct\nfrom the information\ncovered on this podcast.\nSo thank you once again\nfor joining me in the\ndiscussion about the use\nof deliberate cold exposure\nfor health and performance\nand last but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science."
