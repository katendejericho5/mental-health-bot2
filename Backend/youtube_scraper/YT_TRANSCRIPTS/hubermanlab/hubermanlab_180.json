    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Andy Galpin.\nDr. Galpin is a full and tenured professor\nin the department of kinesiology\nat California State\nUniversity in Fullerton.\nHe is also a world expert\nin all things exercise\nscience and kinesiology.\nToday, you are going to\nhear what is essentially\na masterclass in how to build fitness,\nno matter what level of\nfitness you happen to have.\nHe talks about how to build endurance,\nand the multiple types of endurance.\nHe talks about how to build\nstrength and hypertrophy,\nwhich is the growth of muscle fibers.\nSo if you're seeking to get stronger,\nor build bigger muscles,\nor build endurance,\nor all of those things, today\nyou're going to learn how.\nYou're also going to learn\nhow to build flexibility,\nhow to hydrate properly for exercise.\nAnd we'll also talk about\nnutrition and supplementation.\nWhat makes Dr. Galpin so unique\nis his ability to span all\nlevels of exercise science.\nHe has the ability to clearly communicate\nthe sets and repetition schemes\nthat one would want to follow,\nfor instance, to build more strength\nor to build larger muscles.\nHe also clearly describes\nexactly how to train\nif you want to build more endurance,\nor enhance cardiovascular function.\nWhat's highly unique about Dr. Galpin\nand the information he teaches,\nand the way he communicates\nthat information,\nis that he can take\nspecific recommendations\nof how recreational exercisers,\nor even professional\nathletes ought to train\nfor their specific goals,\nand link that to specific mechanisms.\nThat is the specific\nchanges that need to occur\nin the nervous system\nand in muscle fibers,\nand indeed right down to the\ngenetics of individual cells\nin your brain and body,\nin order for those exercise\nadaptations to occur.\nIt's truly rare to find\nsomebody that can span\nso many different levels of analyses,\nand who is able to communicate\nall those levels of understanding\nin such a clear and actionable way.\nIndeed, Dr. Galpin is one\nof just a handful of people\nto which I and many others look\nwhen they want to make sure\nthat the information that\nthey're getting about exercise\nis gleaned from quality\npeer-reviewed studies,\nhands-on experience\nwith a wide variety of research subjects,\nmeaning everyday people\nall the way up to professional athletes\nin a wide variety of sports.\nSo it's no surprise that he's not only\none of the most knowledgeable,\nbut also the most trusted\nvoices in exercise science.\nDr. Galpin is also an avid communicator\nof zero cost to consumer\ninformation about exercise science.\nYou can find him on\nInstagram at Dr. Andy Galpin,\nand also on Twitter at Dr. Andy Galpin.\nBoth places he provides\nterrific information\nabout recent studies,\nboth from his laboratory\nand from other laboratories,\nmore in depth protocols of the sort\nthat you'll hear about today.\nSo if you're not already\nfollowing him, be sure to do so.\nHe provides only the best information.\nHe's extremely nuanced\nand precise and clear\nin delivering that information.\nI'm certain that by the end\nof today's conversation,\nyou'll come away with a\ntremendous amount of new knowledge\nthat you can devote to\nyour exercise pursuits.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat I'm hosting two live events this May.\nThe first live event will be\nhosted in Seattle, Washington\non May 17th.\nThe second live event will\nbe hosted in Portland, Oregon\non May 18th.\nBoth are part of a lecture series entitled\n\"The Brain Body Contract\",\nduring which I will discuss\nscience and science-based tools\nfor mental health, physical\nhealth, and performance.\nI should point out that\nwhile some of the material I'll cover\nwill overlap with information covered here\non the \"Huberman Lab Podcast\",\nand on various social media posts,\nmost of the information I will\ncover is going to be distinct\nfrom information covered on\nthe podcast or elsewhere.\nSo once again, it's Seattle on May 17th,\nPortland on May 18th.\nYou can access tickets by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com/tour.\nAnd I hope to see you there.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day,\nis that it helps me cover all\nof my basic nutritional needs.\nIt makes up for any\ndeficiencies that I might have.\nIn addition, it has probiotics\nwhich are vital for microbiome health.\nI've done a couple of episodes now\non the so-called gut microbiome\nand the ways in which\nthe microbiome interacts\nwith your immune system, with\nyour brain, to regulate mood,\nand essentially with\nevery biological system\nrelevant to health throughout\nyour brain and body.\nWith Athletic Greens, I\nget the vitamins I need,\nthe minerals I need, and the probiotics\nto support my microbiome.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,\nand claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it easy to\nmix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nplus a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nThere are a ton of data now showing that\nvitamin D3 is essential\nfor various aspects of\nour brain and body health.\nEven if we're getting a lot of sunshine,\nmany of us are still\ndeficient in vitamin D3.\nAnd K2 is also important\nbecause it regulates things like\ncardiovascular function,\ncalcium in the body, and so on.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand the year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Thesis.\nThesis makes what are called nootropics,\nwhich means smart drugs.\nNow, to be honest, I am not\na fan of the term nootropics.\nI don't believe in smart drugs\nin the sense that I don't believe\nthat there's any one substance\nor collection of substances\nthat can make us smarter.\nI do believe, based on science however,\nthat there are particular neural circuits\nand brain functions that\nallow us to be more focused,\nmore alert, access creativity,\nbe more motivated, et cetera.\nThat's just the way that the brain works.\nDifferent neural circuits\nfor different brain states.\nAnd so the idea of a nootropic\nthat's just going to make us\nsmarter all around,\nfails to acknowledge that\nsmarter is many things, right?\nIf you're an artist, you're a\nmusician, you're doing math,\nyou're doing accounting,\na different part of the day\nyou need to be creative,\nthese are all different brain processes.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd as far as I know, they're\nthe first nootropics company\nto create targeted nootropics\nfor specific outcomes.\nThey only use the highest\nquality ingredients,\nwhich of course is essential.\nSome of those I've talked\nabout on the podcast,\nthings like DHA, Ginko\nbiloba, phosphatidylserine.\nThey give you the ability to\ntry several different blends\nover the course of a month,\ndiscover which nootropics work best\nfor your unique brain chemistry\nand genetics and goals,\nand with that personalization,\ndesign a kit of nootropics\nthat's ideal for the different\nbrain and body states\nyou want to access.\nI've been using Thesis for\nmore than six months now,\nand I can confidently\nsay that their nootropics\nhave been a total game-changer.\nMy go-to formula is the clarity formula,\nor sometimes I'll use their\nenergy formula before training.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman,\ntake a three minute quiz,\nand Thesis will send you\nfour different formulas\nto try in your first month.\nThat's takethesis.com/huberman,\nand use the code Huberman at checkout\nfor 10% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from\nyour blood and DNA,\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed with\na quality blood test.\nWhat's unique about Inside Tracker is that\nwhile there are a lot of\ndifferent tests out there\nfor hormones and metabolic\nfactors, et cetera,\nwith Inside Tracker,\nyou get the numbers back\nin terms of your levels,\nbut they also give you\nvery clear directives\nin terms of lifestyle,\nnutrition and supplementation,\nthat can help you bring\nthose values into the ranges\nthat are best for you\nand your health goals.\nAnd that's very different than\na lot of the other programs,\nwhere you get a lot of information,\nbut you don't really know what\nto do with that information.\nInside Tracker makes that\nall very easy to understand\nand very actionable, based on\nthe very easy to use dashboard\nat Inside Tracker.\nIf you'd like to try Inside Tracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 20% off any of\nInside Tracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin.\nWelcome Dr. Professor Andy Galpin.\nIt's been a long time coming.\nWe have friends in common,\nbut this is actually the\nfirst time we've sat down\nface-to-face.\n- Yeah, I'm very excited.\n- Yeah, there are only a handful,\nmeaning about three or four people,\nwho I trust enough in the\nexercise physiology space,\nthat when they speak, I not only listen,\nbut I modify my protocols,\nand you are among those\nthree or four people.\nSo first of all, a debt\nof gratitude, thank you.\nYou've greatly shaped\nthe protocols that I use.\nAnd I know there's far more\nfor me and for others to learn.\nSo you're a professor,\nyou teach in university,\nand you have a tremendous\nrange of levels of exploration.\nMuscle biopsy, literally\nimages down the microscope,\nall the way to training\nprofessional athletes\nand everything in between.\nSo you are truly an N-of-1.\nAnd just to start us off,\nI would love to have you share with us\nwhat you think most everybody,\nor even everybody should know,\nabout principles of strength training,\nprinciples of endurance\ntraining, and principles of,\nlet's call it hypertrophy power\nand the other sort of\ncategories of training.\nAnd this could be very top contour.\nBut what do you think everybody\non planet Earth should know\nabout these categories of\npersonal and athletic development?\n- Well, that's a great first question.\nHoly cow!\nI think I'll start it this way.\nI tend to think about,\nthere's about nine different adaptations\nyou can get from exercise.\nFat loss is not one of those.\nIt is a byproduct.\nBut that's not really what I'm getting at.\nAnd so we can kind of\ncategorize everything like that.\nAnd what we're going\nto, we can talk about,\nor what are the concepts\nthat you need to hit\nwithin each one.\nAnd then you could have\ninfinite discussion\nof the different methodologies, right?\nAnd so that first thing to hit is\nthe concepts are actually fairly few,\nbut the methods are many, right?\nPeople have said that in\niterations throughout time.\nSo if you walk from the very beginning,\nthe first one to think about\nis what we'll just call skill.\nSo this is improving anything\nfrom say a golf swing,\nto a squatting technique, to running.\nAnd this is just simply\nmoving mechanically,\nhow you want your body to move.\nI'm just going to\nglobally call that skill.\nFrom there, we're going to get into speed.\nSo this is moving as fast as possible.\nThe next one is power, and\npower is a function of speed,\nbut it is also a function of the next one,\nwhich is strength.\nSo if you actually\nmultiply strength by speed,\nyou get power.\nAnd the reason I'm making this\ndistinction by the way is,\nsome of these are very close,\nand I'm going in a specific\norder on purpose here.\nFor example, power is, like I just said,\nit's a function of speed and strength.\nSo if you improve speed, you've\nalso likely improved power.\nBut not necessarily, right,\n'cause it could've come from\nthe force direction either.\nSo there's carryover,\nso like a lot of things that you would do\nfor the development of strength and power,\nthey are somewhat similar,\nbut then there's differences, right?\nSo things that you would\ndo correctly for power\nwould really not develop much\nstrength, and vice versa.\nSo we can get into all\nthese details later.\nOnce you get past strength,\nand the next one kind of\ndown the list is hypertrophy,\nthis is muscle size, right?\nGrowing muscle mass is\none way to think about it.\nAfter hypertrophy, you get\ninto these categories of,\nthe next one is,\nthese are all globally\nendurance-based issues.\nAnd the very first one is\ncalled muscular endurance.\nSo this is your ability to do\nhow many pushups can you do\nin one minute?\nYou know, things like that.\nPast muscular endurance,\nyou're now into more of an energetic\nor even cardiovascular fatigue.\nSo you've left the local muscle,\nand you're now into the\nentire physiological system,\nand its ability to\nproduce and sustain work.\nAnd we can get into a\nbunch of differentiations\nwith an endurance,\nbut just to keep it\nreally simple right now,\nthe very first one, think about this as,\nI call this anaerobic power, right?\nSo this is your ability\nto produce a lot of work\nfor say 30 seconds to maybe one minute,\nkind of two minutes like that.\nThe next one down then\nis more closely aligned\nto what we'll call your VO2 max.\nSo this is your ability to\nkind of do the same thing,\nbut more of a time domain\nof say three to 12 minutes.\nSo this is going to be\na maximum heart rate,\nbut it's going to be well\npast just max heart rate.\nThen after that we have what I\ncall long duration endurance.\nSo this is your ability to sustain work.\nThe time domain doesn't matter in terms of\nhow fast you're going.\nIt's how long can you sustain work?\nThis is 30 plus minutes of no break.\nLike that.\nSo as just an high level overview,\nthose are the different\nthings you can target.\nAnd again, some of those crossover,\nand some are actually\na little bit contrarian\nto the other ones.\nSo pushing towards one\nis maybe going to\nsacrifice something else.\nSo as an overall start, that's\nreally what we're looking at.\nWithin all those though, they\ndo have similar concepts,\nin terms of there is a handful\nof things you have got to do\nto make all of those things work.\nAnd we could talk about as\nmany of those as you want,\nbut one of them is functionally\ncalled progressive overload.\nSo whichever one you're\ntrying to improve at,\nif you want to continue to improve,\nyou have to have some method of overload.\nAnd as you well know, and\nyou've talked about a lot,\nadaptation, physiologically,\nhappens as a byproduct of stress.\nSo you have to push a system.\nSo if you continue to do\nsay the exact same workout\nover time, you better not\nexpect much improvement.\nYou can keep maintenance,\nbut you're not going to be\nadding additional stress.\nSo in general, you have\nto have some sort of\nprogressive overload,\nand we can talk in detail\nabout what that means for each category.\nBut this could come from\nadding more weights.\nThis could come from\nadding more repetitions.\nIt could come from doing\nit more often in the week.\nIt could come from adding\ncomplexity to the movement.\nSo going from say a\npartial range of motion\nto a full range of motion,\nor adding other variables.\nSo there's a lot of\ndifferent ways to progress.\nBut you have to have some\nsort of movement forward.\nSo if you have this kind of routine\nwhere you've built Monday, Wednesday,\nand Saturday or something, and\nyou just do that infinitely,\nyou're not going to get very far.\nSo that's, I guess the\nmost high level overview\nof all the things people can go after,\nand then we can go from\nwhatever direction you want from there.\n- Well I'd love to do the\ndeep dive on each one of these\n- Yeah man.\n- for several hours.\nBut, and I imagine that\nover time, we probably will.\nI'd love to chat about a couple of these\nin a bit more depth.\nSo in terms of defining\nwhat the progressive\noverload variables are,\n- Yeah.\n- for these\ndifferent categories,\nmaybe we could hit the two\nmost common combinations\nof these nine things.\nThe first one being\nstrength and hypertrophy.\n- Yeah.\n- And maybe we could\nlump power in there.\nMaybe not.\nYou're the exercise\nphysiologist.\n- Yes and no, yeah.\n- But strength and hypertrophy,\nwhich at least bears some relationship.\nAnd then maybe separately we could explore\nsustained work endurance.\nThis 30 minutes or longer continuously,\n'cause I think many people\ntrain in that regime.\nAnd probably something like\nVO2 max anaerobic as well,\nbecause I know that a number\nof people now incorporate\nso-called HIIT or high\nintensity interval training,\nI think with the hopes of\neither shortening their workout.\n- Yeah.\n- And or,\ngaining some additional\ncardiovascular benefit.\nSo if we could start with\nstrength and hypertrophy,\nI know many people want to be stronger.\nThey want to grow larger muscles,\nor at least maintain what they have.\nSo what are the progressive\noverload principles\nthat are most effective over time\nfor strength and hypertrophy?\n- Yeah, okay.\nSo I'll actually go a little step back.\nWith every one of those\ncategories I talked about,\nyou have what we call\nyour modifiable variables.\nSo this is a very short list\nof all the things you can modify,\nthe different variables\nwithin your workout\nthat can be modified, that\nwill change the outcome.\nA fancy way of saying, if\nyou do this differently,\nthen you're going to\nget a different result.\nSo modifiable variables.\nThe very first one of\nthose is called choice.\nSo this is the exercise\nchoice that you select.\nNow one of, I'm going\nto go double back here,\nso I'm kind of doing a\nlittle bit of inception.\nSo follow me here as I'm going up a layer\nto come down a couple layers.\nI have these fundamental laws\nof strength and conditioning\nthat, they're kind of like\na little bit of a joke.\nBut progressive overload's\none of those laws.\nAnother one of those laws\nis your exercises themselves\ndo not determine adaptations.\nSo here's what I mean.\nIf you're like I want to get stronger,\nyou can't select an exercise.\nThat doesn't determine you getting strong.\nIf you don't do the exercise correctly,\nand I'm not even referring\nto the technique.\nThat of course matters.\nBut if you don't execute\nit in the right fashion,\nthen you're not going\nto get that adaptation.\nSo if you choose I want to get stronger,\nI'm going to do a bench press.\nWell, if you do the wrong set range,\nthe wrong repetition\nrange, the wrong speed,\nyou won't get strength, you\nmaybe get muscular endurance,\nand very little strength adaptation.\nSo the exercise selection\nitself is important,\nbut it does not determine\nthe outcome adaptation.\nSo the very first thing\nthat you need to think about\nif you're like I want to\nget stronger or add muscle,\nis not the exercise choice, right?\nIt is the application of the exercise.\nWhat are the sets, what are the reps,\nwhat are the rest ranges\nthat you're using?\nThat's going to be your\nprimary determinant.\nNow some exercises are certainly better\nfor some adaptations.\nFor example, a deadlift is\nprobably not a great exercise\nto do for long duration endurance.\nLike you could theoretically do\n30 straight minutes of dead-lifting,\nbut it's probably not\nour best choice, right?\nIt's probably a pretty good choice\nfor strength development, right,\n'cause you're going to do a\nlow repetition, high set range.\nYou could theoretically\ndo bicep curls for power,\nbut probably not your best choice, right?\nSingle joint isolation\nmovement is not the best\nfor developing power.\nIf you've ever done a bicep curl\nas fast as you possibly can,\nlike that's not going to go well.\nSo in theory, any exercise\ncan produce any adaptation,\ngiven the execution is performed properly.\nSo now that we've understood\nthat a little bit,\nthe exercise itself does not\ndetermine the adaptation.\nComing within each one\nof these categories,\nexercise choice is an important variable\nbecause it does lend you to things like\nwhat movement pattern you're in.\nSo in other words, if\nyou want to get stronger\nand you're thinking, okay,\nwhat exercise do I do,\nyou need to think a little bit about\nwhat muscle groups do I want to use,\nand that's going to be leading\nyou towards the exercise choice.\nFor example, I want to use my quads more.\nOkay, fine.\nMaybe you're going to\nchoose more of a front squat\ntype of variation, a goblet squat,\nso the bar, the load is in front of you.\nIf you want to emphasize\nmaybe more of your hamstrings and glutes,\nyou're going to maybe put\na barbell on your back\nor do a different one.\nSo the exercise choice is\nimportant to the prescription\nbecause it's going to determine\na lot of your success.\nOkay, another kind of simpler\nway to think about this.\nIf you're a beginner, or\nmoderate to intermediate,\nor maybe you don't have a coach,\nyou probably want to hedge\ntowards an exercise selection\nthat is a little bit easier technically.\nSo you maybe don't want to\ndo a barbell back squat.\nIt's actually a pretty\ncomplicated movement.\nMaybe you want to do a\nlittle bit more of, again,\na goblet squat, or even use\nsome machines, or a split squat,\nsomething that's a little bit simpler\nbecause you don't have a coach,\nyou're not a professional athlete.\nThe likelihood of success is higher,\nand the risk is now gone lower.\nSo the very first variable\nwithin all of these\nis the exercise choice.\nThe second one is the\nintensity, and that refers to,\nin this context, not perceived effort,\nlike, wow, that was a\nreally intense workout.\nIt is quite literally either a percentage\nof your one rep at max,\nor a percentage of your\nmaximum heart rate or VO2 max.\nSo for the strength-based things,\nyou want to think about\nwhat's the percentage\nof the maximum weight\nI could lift one time,\nand that's what we're\ngoing to call one rep max.\nOr it's a percentage of\nmy heart rate, right?\nSo if I tell you to get on a bike\nand I want you to do intervals,\nand I want you to get 75%,\nI'm typically referring to\n75% of your max heart rate,\nor VO2 max, or something like that.\nIf I tell you to do squats at 75%,\nthat means 75% of the\nmaximum amount of weight\nyou could lift one time, or close.\n- In terms of determining one rep max,\nI confess I've never actually\ntaken the one rep max\nfor any exercise.\nBut I have some internal sense\nof what that might be or\nwhat range it might be.\nIs it necessary for people to assess\ntheir one repetition maximum,\nbefore going into these sorts of programs?\n- No, not at all.\nI think a more intuitive way\nis to take a repetition range.\nWell, you can do this a\ncouple of different ways.\nSo there are equations you can run,\nand you can just Google these anywhere,\nand these are called conversion charts.\nAnd so it says okay, if I did\n75 pounds on my bench press\nand I did it eight times,\nyou can just run an estimate to say, okay,\nyou're probably going to be able to bench\nabout 95 pounds for one\nrep max or something.\nSo that's a very easy conversion chart.\nSo just pick a load that\nyou feel comfortable with,\nbut it's kind of heavy\nbut not like crazy heavy,\nand do as many repetitions as you can\nwith a really good technique.\nAnd then look what that number would be.\nSo conversion charts.\n- Probably safer than doing it\none repetition maximum.\n- For the general public who has, again,\nno coaching, it's safer.\nFor a professional athlete,\nit's not any safer, but,\nor not even a professional athlete,\nbut a trained person with a coach.\nBut for most people, yeah,\nthat's a good way to go about it.\nYou can also just kind of do it with feel,\nin the sense that say you want to do\na set of five repetitions,\nand you do the load,\nand you think I could've\ndone one or two more.\nAnd then you kind of have an idea of\nwhat that number's going to be.\nIf you think, man, that\nlast one I had to kind of\nreally, really, really get after it,\nthen maybe just call\nthat that number, right?\nSo you don't have to get overly concerned.\nIn fact, when we start getting\ninto these number ranges,\nyou're going to see\nthat they're all ranges.\nWe're not going to give a specific 95%,\nfor one of these exact reasons.\nIt's not that precise for most of 'em.\nIn fact, some of 'em like hypertrophy\nhave enormous ranges that\nyou like almost can't miss.\nSo the intensity in that case\ndoesn't even matter for the most part,\nbecause that's not the\nprimary determinant.\nSome of these you're going to\nsee intensity as a determinant,\nand some of these you're\ngoing to see volume\nis the true determinant.\nSo intensity though is that second one,\nchoice was the very first\none, manipulable variable.\nIntensity was the second one.\nThe third one is what we call volume.\nAnd so this is just how many reps\nand how many sets are you doing, right?\nSo if you're going to do three sets of 10,\nthat volume would be 30, right?\nFive sets of five, that volume is 25.\nIt's just a simple equation.\nHow much work are you totally doing?\nThe next one past that\nis called rest intervals.\nSo this is the amount\nof time you're taking\nin between typically a set.\nThen from there, you have progression,\nwhich is what we started to talk about,\nthis progressive overload,\nare you increasing by weight, or reps,\nor rest intervals, or\ncomplexity, or whatever.\nSo all of those things can be changed\nas a method of progression.\nAnd so maybe you want to go progressing\nfrom a single joint exercise,\nlike a leg extension on a machine,\nand you want to progress\nby moving to a whole body\nmovement like a squat.\nThat in of itself,\nyou don't have to change the\nload, or the reps, or the rest.\nThat is a representation\nof progressive overload.\nAnd it's probably a pretty\ngood place to start,\nbecause number one,\nespecially for beginners,\nyou want to make sure that the\nmovement pattern is correct.\nDon't worry about intensity.\nDon't worry about rep ranges\nor any of these things.\nYou need to learn to move correctly,\nand you need to give your\nbody some time to develop\nsome tissue tolerance.\nSo that you're not getting overtly sore.\nIn general, soreness is a terrible proxy\nfor exercise quality.\nIt's a really bad way to estimate\nwhether it was a good or a bad workout,\nespecially for people in that\nbeginner to middle to moderate.\nIn fact, even for our\nprofessional athletes,\nwe do not use soreness as\na metric of a good workout.\nIt's a really bad idea\nfor a bunch of reasons.\nOn the same token,\nbecause stress is required for adaptation,\nyou don't want to leave\nthe gym and feel like\nI didn't really do much.\nThere has to be there.\nSo if you think about soreness\non a scale of one to 10,\nyou probably want to\nspend most of your time\nin like the three.\n- You mean post-exercise?\n- Yeah.\n- In between workouts.\n- [Andy] Totally.\n- And I know we'll talk about\nrecovery extensively later,\nbut if one body part or\nset of body parts is sore,\nis that an indication that one\nshould stay out of training?\nI would imagine the answer is no.\n- Right.\n- In most cases.\nAnd secondarily to that, if\na particular muscle is sore,\ndoes that mean that muscle is\nnot ready to be trained again?\n- Yeah, the answer to both\nthose is the same, which is no.\nRight?\nYou can certainly train a sore muscle.\nYou need to, I guess,\nhave a little bit of feel on that, right?\nSo if you're sore of like, okay,\nand you're moving around a\nlittle bit and you're like, man,\nthis is a little bit sore, you can train.\nIf you're like, I can't sit\non the couch without crying\nbecause my glutes are so sore,\nlike we probably don't\nneed to train again, right.\n- Does whimpering count as crying?\n- Yeah, in that particular case I'd say\nyou've actually gone to\na place of detriment,\nbecause now you're going to\nhave to skip a training session.\nAnd now you're behind,\nso your actual total\nvolume say across the month\nis actually going to be lower\nbecause you went way too\nhard in those workouts,\nhad to take too many days off in between.\nYou're going to see that you're\ngoing to cover less distance\nover the course of a month,\nor six month, or even a year.\nSo you want to walk a pretty fine line,\nand for most people I would\nsay hedge a little bit\non the side of less sore than more so.\nBecause frequency is very, very important\nfor almost all these adaptations.\n- Training frequency.\n- Which is the last\nmodifiable variable, right?\nFrequency.\nWhich is how many times per\nweek are you doing that thing?\nSo those are, kind of are global things\nthat we can play with.\nSo when I'm trying to manipulate,\nand you can get strength\nversus hypertrophy,\nor, you know, I want like\na little bit of both,\nall those variables are the things\nthat are going through my mind.\nWhich one do I need to\nmove in which direction,\nso that I can get this outcome\nand not this outcome over here?\nFor example, some folks\nmight want to get stronger,\nbut not put muscle mass on.\nSome folks just kind of want both.\nAnd that's a lot of the general public.\nI want to get a little stronger\nand a little bit more muscle.\nGreat.\nBut there are instances where people,\nfor performance reasons or for\npurely personal preference,\nlike I don't want to get\nany more muscle, great,\nbut I want to get stronger.\nAwesome.\nIf you manipulate those\nvariables correctly,\nyou can get exactly that.\nVery little development of muscle size,\nand a lot of development in strength.\nAnd this is why we continue to\nbreak world records in sports\nlike power lifting and weightlifting,\nthat have weight classes.\nSo there's a top number that we can hit\nin terms of body size,\nbut yet we continue to\nget stronger and faster.\nSo this is very possible,\nif you understand how to\nmanipulate all those variables.\nSo that being said, we can start off with,\nyou wanted to go strength and-\n- Yeah strength, and I love\nthat you mention the fact that\nit is possible to increase strength\nwithout increasing muscle size,\nat least not dramatically,\nbecause think it's not\njust weight class athletes.\nI know a lot of people\nwho, for aesthetic reasons,\nthey'd like to be stronger,\nthey're hearing that having strong bones\nand strong muscles and tendons,\nit's great for longevity\nand for avoiding injury,\nand so many other features of life.\nAnd yet they don't want to fill out\nprogressively larger and\nlarger sizes of clothing.\n- And we can go harder to\nthe mechanisms on that piece\nif you want, or we can save\nthat and come back to it.\n- Sure.\nWhat I'd love to, both,\nwhat I'd love to know was\nif we could define some of\nthese modifiable variables,\n- Yeah.\n- in the context of strength.\nSo let's say I-\n- Oh okay, yes.\n- was somebody who,\nI come to you and I say,\nand let's just say for\nsake of balance here,\n'cause she actually does\ndo some weight training.\nI bring my sister in,\nand I say, me and my sister\nboth want to get stronger.\nWhat modifiable variables should,\nhow should we modify the variables?\n- Love it, all right, great.\nI'm going to do inception\non you one more time.\nSo one of my other laws, this\none will be fast, I promise,\nof strength and\nconditioning, is in general,\nthe default is all joints\nthrough all range of motion.\nSo this is important\nbecause it's going to answer\nyour very first question\non this strength category.\nSo in general, the ankle should go through\nthe full range of motion in the ankle.\nThe knee should go through\nthe full range of motion\nin the knee.\nThe hip, the elbow, et\ncetera, et cetera, right?\n- Across the workout,\nnot in a single movement.\n- Well, right.\n- I would hope.\nUnless there's an amazing\nexercise I haven't heard about.\n- Well there are some exercises\nthat we're going to call\nmore full body.\nThink about a full snatch.\nLike you're going to take\na lot of your muscles,\na lot of your joints through\na lot of the range of motions.\nOther ones like in isolation,\nwe call these single joint exercises.\nSo imagine a bicep curl.\nYou have one joint in\nthat particular case,\nthe elbow moving.\nThe shoulder and everything\nelse is pretty much stable.\nAnd this is how we'll differentiate\nmulti-joint from single joint movements.\nBut yeah, so across,\nI would even say it doesn't\neven have to be the day,\nbut maybe throughout the week,\ntry to get every joint\nthrough full range of motion.\nNow, a couple of quick caveats to that.\nI am not advocating using\nfull range of motion,\nand allowing really\nbad exercise technique.\nSo when I say full range of\nmotion, that's the default.\nThat doesn't mean every\nsingle person can do that\nfor every single exercise.\nIt means that's where we\nshould be striving to,\nand that's our starting point.\nYou're going to see a lot less injury\nand a lot more productivity\nout of your training sessions.\nIn fact, the science is\nfairly clear on this one.\nStrength development\nas well as hypertrophy\nis generally enhanced\nwith a larger range of motion of training.\nAnd the mechanisms are like\nsomewhat understood on that.\nSo that being said,\nif you have to get into say a bad position\nwith your say lower back,\nthe spine is a very good one.\nIn general, the spine should stay,\nit's very neutral is what we call it.\nSo no flexion, no extension,\nespecially in the lumbar region.\nSo if you're doing a, say a deadlift,\nand in order to take your knee through\na full range of motion or deadlift,\nyou have to compromise your back position,\nthat's no [speaking in foreign language].\nSo, caveats there aside, don't kill me,\nlike in good positions\nalways.\n- And don't kill yourselves.\n- Yes.\n- More importantly.\n- So why that matters is if\nwe walk through strength,\nthe very first thing\nI'm going to go through\nis the exercise selection.\nSo let's choose an\nexercise which ideally has\na full range of motion or close to it,\nthat doesn't induce injury for you,\nthat you can still maintain\ngood neck and low back\nand position and everything else.\nYou feel comfortable with,\nso you can feel strong\nbut you don't feel like, oh my gosh,\nif you've never snatched before,\nhaving you do a snatch\nfor a maximum, even 75%,\nlike it's a terrible idea.\nYou're not going to feel confident,\nit's going to be a train wreck.\nI would rather put you\non a machine bench press,\nso you can go I feel\nstable, I feel safe here,\nand I could just express my strength.\nSo exercise choice in\ngeneral, full range of motion,\nand you want to kind of balance\nbetween the movement areas.\nSo this is an upper body press,\nso this is pushing away from you.\nBench press, things like that.\nUpper body pull, pulling\nan implement towards you.\nBent row, pull up.\nThe pressing should be horizontal.\nSo perpendicular to your\nbody, as well as vertical.\nSo this is lifting a weight\nover top of your head,\nlifting a weight away from you.\nThe pull version is\npulling horizontally to you\nand pulling vertically down.\nPull up, things like that.\nFrom the lower body, we\ntypically call these hinges.\nIt's sort of a funny muscle thing\nthat no one's going to laugh at,\nbut like maybe me and you here,\nis we'll categorize muscles\nas, or movements, exercises,\nas pushes and pulls, right?\nSo like a squat tends to be a push,\n'cause you're pushing away the ground.\nA deadlift is a pull,\n'cause you're pulling\nthe implement up to you.\nBut in reality, every single\nexercise is only ever a pull,\n'cause muscle doesn't push things away,\nmuscle can only contract\nand pull on itself.\nAnd so again, super nerdy thing that like\nmost people are like, yeah,\nand everyone's like, that's so dumb.\n- No, but I think it's\na really important point\nbecause it also speaks to something\nI think we'll get into later,\nwhich is that, you know,\nposterior chain, anterior chain.\n- [Andy] Totally.\n- And if that's mysterious to people,\nit'll become clear before long.\nPosterior chain, anterior chain,\nmakes a lot of sense to me\nbecause of the way it's grounded\nin the firing of motor neurons,\nwhich is ultimately what controls muscle.\nSo it's also I think-\n- You and your nerves\nall the time.\n- Exactly, so it also depends\non the lens through which one\nlooks at life and exercise.\nOf course my lens is\nprimarily neuroscience.\nBut I realized that the\nimportance, I like this idea\nof pushing perpendicular\nthe body overhead,\npulling both toward the\nbody and from overhead.\nThat just makes really\ngood, intuitive sense,\nespecially since a lot of people\nare just listening to this\nand not watching it.\nSo in your minds, folks, you\ncan think about pushing away\nlike a punch or overhead, like\nlifting something overhead,\nand then pulling toward your midline\nor towards your body rather,\nand then pulling yourself up\nlike a pull up in PE class,\nfor those of.\n- Yeah.\n- That experienced-\n- So the lower body's\nthe same thing, right?\nIt's some sort of pushing away\nlike a squat, or a\nsplit squat, or a lunge,\nor something like that.\nAnd then some sort of, again,\nwhat we'll call pull or hinge.\nSo a deadlift or Romanian\ndeadlift, or a hamstring curl,\nor something where you're\ncontracting and pulling the thing.\nAnd you could split these into\nlike a thousand different categories.\nIf you're really in that field,\nyou're going to want to\nadd a bunch of other ones.\nBut that's just like a rough conception,\nso if you're going to do a single workout,\nyou could choose four exercises,\nand you could choose one of each.\nOne press, upper body\npress, one upper body pull,\none lower body hinge,\none lower body press.\nAnd then that would be like\na decently well-rounded exercise.\nThat's your exercise selection.\nAnd if you're taking those\nthrough a full range of motion,\nyou're at a pretty good spot.\nAs close as you can.\nThe next one is intensity.\nSo if you want to develop strength,\nthis comes back to one\nof my favorite scientists\nof all time who happens to\nbe a nerve guy actually.\nAnd generally, I like to shit on nerves\nas much as I possibly can,\n'cause I'm a muscle guy.\nBut I have to give Henneman\nsome credit here, right.\nAnd I know you know who that is.\n- Henneman size principle.\n- Yeah, of course, right?\nSo this is a series of\npapers, I think in the,\nI think it was in nature.\n- At least some of them, yeah.\n- Yeah, in 1954, '56, or like something.\nYou can fact check me, I'm sure you will.\nBut he basically outlined\nthis idea that, okay,\nthere's a certain\nrecruitment threshold needed\nfor neurons to fire.\nAnd we have muscle\nfibers in what we'll call\nfast twitch muscle fibers and\nslow twitch muscle fibers.\nAnd in general,\nyou're going to activate\nthe slow twitch ones first\nbecause they tend to be associated with\nlow threshold motor neurons.\nIt's not exactly that way,\nbut it's close enough, right?\nWell, the only way that you activate\nsome of these higher threshold neurons\nis to demand the muscle\nto produce more force,\nand it's fairly specific to force, right?\nIt's not something you can do\nover an endurance thing, right,\nunless it gets really\nextreme and fatigue happens.\nSo in general, the only way to use\nthese big chunks of your muscle,\nwhich are incredibly important\nfor aging by the way,\none of the major problems we\nhave with aging developing\nor development of aging-related\nissues with muscle,\nis the fact that we lose fast\ntwitch fibers preferentially.\nAnd then we have major problems\nas we go down the line,\nbecause we've lost a big\nchunk of our strength in size.\nSo you want to make sure these\nfibers stay alive and intact.\nOkay, so if that being said,\nthe only way to develop strength\nis then to challenge the muscle\nto produce more total force.\nIf you are fairly untrained or new,\nI guess I should have stated this\nall at the beginning as well,\none more inception then I'll stop.\nWhen it comes to this level of detail\nof exercise prescription,\na fairly untrained person\nis going to respond\nbasically the same to\nevery single thing you do.\nIn fact, we've done this\nin the lab many times,\nwe've done training\nstudies doing things like\n30 minutes of cycling,\nand seen huge increases in\nmuscle strength and size,\nwhich is not a prescription\nfor most people\nto increase size, but people\nthat are really untrained,\nif you did plyometrics\nor strength training\nor endurance running,\nthey all just get better at everything.\nSo that caveat kind of aside,\nif you want to be more\nintentional and more specific\nto the goal of strength, you\nneed to produce more force.\nSpecificity matters, right?\nSo we have size principle\nto help understand this.\nAnd we have our laws of specificity\nwhich say SAID principle, right?\nSpecific adaptation to imposed demand.\nSo the adaptation you get, or\nthe result of your training,\nis going to be a reflection of\nthe demand that you imposed.\nSo if you want to get stronger,\nyou need to impose a demand\nof strength, not repetitions.\nSo this has to be, the\nload has to be very high.\nIn general, you're probably looking at\nabove 85% of your one rep at max.\nIf you're moderately\ntrained, maybe 75% will work.\nLowly trained, again, everything works.\nBut in general, we want\nto be pressing a load\nthat's very high.\nSo because the intensity\ndemand is so high,\nthat is going to force you\nto do a low repetition range.\nYou can't do 12 reps at 95%.\nThen it wouldn't be 95%\nof your one rep at max.\nSo by definition,\ntrue strength training is\nreally going to be in the like\nfive repetitions per set or less range.\nThat's where most of it's going to occur.\nWith specificity.\nSo we've covered choice,\nintensity, and repetitions, right?\nThe total amount of sets that you do\nis really kind of up to your\npersonal fitness level, right?\nIf you did as little as like\nthree sets per exercise,\nthat's probably enough.\n- Work sets.\n- Totally, yeah, totally work sets, right.\nSo get fully warmed up\nand build up to that 85%.\nDon't just walk into\nthe gym and throw 85% on\nand go thank you, that's\nan important distinction.\nSo work your way up.\nDo some, like a very classic\nwarm up thing would be\nlike a set of 10 at 50%.\nA set of eight at 60%.\nA set of maybe eight again at 70%.\nAnd then maybe like a set of five at 75%.\nSo two or three or four sets\nkind of building intensity\nand lowering rep range.\nAnd then you would go after\nyour two or three working sets.\nAlso, in terms of rest intervals,\nnow, because we're trying to,\nthe primary driver of\nstrength is intensity.\nIt's not the volume,\nright, it's the intensity.\nSo in order to maintain that\nwe have to do a low repetition range.\nBut in addition, we also have\nto have a high rest interval.\nBecause if we start to,\nif we have any amount of fatiguing occur,\nand we have to then either reduce the reps\nor reduce the intensity,\nwe've lost the primary driver.\nWe've lost that main signal.\nSo the number we're going\nto throw out typically\nis like two to four minutes.\nSo imagine you did your set of bench press\nand you did five repetitions at 85%.\nYou probably want to\nrest two to four minutes\nbefore coming back to the bench.\nThat doesn't mean you have\nto sit there on your phone.\nIn fact, please don't.\nEveryone will thank you for\nnot doing that, I promise.\nYou can engage other muscle groups.\nThis is what we would call super setting.\nSo you're doing your bench press,\nand while that two minute clock\nis running for your chest,\nto rest, you can go over\nand do your deadlifts.\nAnd so you can kind of\nmove back and forth,\nand this is how you can\nmake strength training\nnot a seven hour workout.\nIf you're a professional athlete,\nyou're going to take that time,\nbecause you want to maximize the outcome.\nWe've done this actually in our lab too,\nsuper sets will reduce the strength gains,\nbut by a tiny amount, and\nmost of us don't care enough,\nrelative to it's going\nto triple the length\nof your training session.\nIt's not worth it.\nSo for the average person I\nwill tell them, yeah, super set.\nFor someone who's trying\nto break a world record\nin weightlifting or power\nlifting, don't super set.\n- Interesting.\nYeah, I think, I've found\nthat I don't recover\nparticularly well from strength\nand hypertrophy training.\nSo-\n- Like in the workout or the next day?\n- From workout to workout,\nunless I keep the total\nduration of those workouts,\nI like to say no more than 60\nminutes of work, of real work.\n- Yep, yep.\n- Maybe 75.\nPast 75. I find that I just start to-\n- [Andy] That's a lot.\n- I have to introduce\nadditional rest days,\nor I just get weaker over time.\nSo I'd set a kind of a limit at 50 minutes\nand then I usually violate that limit\nand end up doing 60 minutes.\nSo I'm excited to hear that\none can super set exercises,\nas long as they work different\nmuscle groups, of course.\n- Yeah.\n- Right.\nSo I wouldn't want to do like\nbench press and overhead press,\nsuper set it,\n'cause you're going to weaken-\n- Yeah.\n- I think that goes without\nsaying for most people,\nbut just to point that out.\nBut that I could do some\npush, pull, push, pull,\nwithout compromising\ntotal intensity that much.\nAnd I certainly would\nbe willing to give up\na rep here or there, or a\nfew pounds here or there.\nAnd may I ask whether\nor not in doing that,\none gets any even tiny bit,\nor more of additional benefit\nin terms of cardiovascular work?\nBecause I imagine after a,\neven a one rep max which I've\nnever done as I mentioned,\nbut let's say I get three\nreps on the overhead press\nand then I get four reps\non a weighted pull up,\nand I'm going back and forth.\nI'm no doubt going to be breathing harder\nthan if I was sitting there\ntexting away on my phone.\n- Yeah.\n- In between sets.\n- Yep, of course.\nYeah, and so in fact in general,\none of the things that\nI'll present in my class\nis a giant list of, in fact on the top\nis all these different\nexercise adaptations\nI started the conversation with.\nAnd on the vertical\ncolumn are as many of the\nphysiological potential\nadaptations one would get.\nSo changes in endogenous pH.\nBlood pressure.\nLymphatic changes.\nBone density.\nAll these things, right, and\njust have this giant list.\nAnd then you can run a matrix\nand you can start to look at,\nokay, if I do speed training,\nam I going to see changes\nin the nervous system?\nWell, like very much so, right?\nThat's the primary, actual\nreason those things work.\nVery little change in the muscle system.\nIt's almost exclusively explained by\nthe central or peripheral\nnervous system, right?\nOn that same token,\nare you going to expect\nmany cardiovascular adaptation from speed?\nAnd the answer is no, because\nalthough we didn't cover it,\nspeed is very low intensity,\nvery low rep range,\nvery high rest.\nWell, as you go to like strength\nand then you go to hypertrophy,\nyou start seeing more and more increases\nin cardiovascular adaptations\nbecause you're doing exactly that, right?\nYou're starting to reduce rest,\nand you're starting to increase volume.\nBut you're going to lose things\nlike bone mineral adaptations,\nbecause the load starts to go down.\nSo you can look at this\nmatrix and kind of understand\nif I'm a person who wants to kind of\nmaximize the adaptations I get\nacross my entire physiology\nfor the least amount of work,\nyou can choose these different\nadaptations to go after\nthat are going to kind of\nland on these things, right?\nAnd exactly as you mentioned,\nif you're going to take five\nminutes rest between each rep.\nSo let's say the extreme,\nyou're going to do three sets\nof one repetition for strength\nat 95%, you're going\nto take probably five,\nmaybe seven minutes between each attempt.\nLike you better not\nexpect many like changes\nin your resting blood pressure.\nThat there's no\ncardiovascular strain there.\nYou're going to put it\ntogether in a circuit\nwhere you're going to lose some\npotential strength adaptation,\nbut you're going to gain something there.\nSo all these things are,\nit's not about good or\nbad or right or wrong.\nIt's always about what\nadvantage do you want\nand what disadvantage do you want?\nAnd I can cut like really\nin to the chase here\non one of these things, 'cause\nwe'll get to this eventually.\nIf you want to know the\nones that are going to\ngenerally give you the most\nphysiological adaptations\nacross the most categories,\nyou're almost always looking for\nhypertrophy type of training.\nAnd then this anaerobic conditioning piece\nthat we'll get into.\nThat's going to hit the\nmost systems at once.\n- That's great to know,\nand we should definitely\ngo a little bit deeper\non those types of what the\nmodifiable variables are\nfor those categories.\n'Cause I think that,\nI'm guessing the vast majority of people\nwant to be a bit stronger, maybe add some,\na little bit of muscle, or more,\nmake sure their heart is\nhealthy and et cetera.\nThis is wonderful, and\nI think is clarifying\ncertainly a lot for me.\nSo for strength, let's, I\nguess training frequency.\n- Frequency, cool.\n- So what should determine\ntraining frequency?\nAnd I had the great\nbenefit of a long time ago\nwhen I was in high school actually,\nI paid for a session over\nthe phone with Mike Mentzer.\n- Oh, lovely!\n- Yeah, the Mike Mentzer.\n- Sure.\n- And we got to be friends,\nover time.\n- High intensity training!\n- At the time I was pretty\nyoung and my mother kept saying\nlike, why is this like\ngrown man calling the house?\nAnd then we would talk all\nthe time about training,\nbut he tried to convince me to train\nonce every five to seven\ndays, very few sets,\nvery high intensity.\nAnd I must say, it worked incredibly well.\n- Sure.\n- It was,\nI think with my recovery\nquotient, which was not very good,\nI think has improved over\ntime but was not very good,\nit was remarkable.\nBut of course this was a\ntime when I was, you know.\n- Full of the most animalism\n- I was 14.\n- you've ever had.\n- On my own version of anabolics, right.\nI had a long arc of puberty, so.\n- And you were untrained.\n- And I was mostly untrained.\nI'd been running cross\ncountry and skateboarding,\nand playing soccer.\nSo.\n- And doing all the things that are like\nthe antithesis of growing muscle.\n- Yeah, it was literally,\nand people would probably say impossible.\nIt was something like 40 pounds of muscle\ninside of 12 months.\nIt was crazy.\n- [Andy] I would believe that.\n- And so, then of course that\nstopped working over time.\n- Sure.\n- And then you start\ngoing down the odyssey of\ntrying to find the thing\nthat's going to work that well.\nAnd you eventually realize that it was\nbecause you were untrained, right?\nSo training frequency is crucial.\nLet's say that people are\ndoing these whole body workouts\nas you've described them,\nnot alternating upper body, lower body,\n'cause there's so many\ndifferent splits that we talk,\nprobably doesn't make sense\nto go into splits right now.\nBut how often can and\nshould one train a muscle?\nAnd how do you know if a\nmuscle is recovered locally?\nAnd how do you know\nif your nervous system is\nrecovered systemically?\n- Okay, this is a bunch of\nreally interesting questions.\nI'm not sure exactly what\nroute you want to go,\nso I'll start here.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nsoreness is not a good barometer\nof exercise quality, because\nsome types of training\nare going to induce more soreness\nand some are going to induce less.\nThat's important to this\nconversation because\nwhen you ask about how do you know\nif a muscle is ready to train again,\none of the question is, well\nwhat are you training for?\nIf you're training for hypertrophy, right,\nmuscle size, muscle growth,\nwe need to hedge towards recovery.\nBecause what you're trying to do is cause\na massive insult there,\nallow then protein synthesis to occur,\nbuilding of new tissue which\ntakes time, 48 to 72 hours,\nlike kind of at a minimum,\nthat process needs to occur.\nIf you're doing actually more strength,\nand this is a differentiation\nbetween hypertrophy and strength,\nthen you didn't induce\nactually much damage.\nIn fact, you're generally\nnot going to get very sore\nfrom true strength training.\nVery little, unless you get\nreally heavy, you did it a lot.\nThe primary driver of hypertrophy\nis not the same primary\ndriver of strength.\nWe talked about that already.\nThat's intensity driven.\nFor hypertrophy it's not intensity.\nSo because we have different mechanisms,\nwe have different outcomes,\neven though they're closely aligned,\nstrength is not going to\ncause a lot of soreness.\nTherefore intensity is the driver.\nTherefore frequency can\nbe as high as you want.\nSo you can train every single\nday the same exact muscle,\nif speed or power or strength\nare the primary training tools,\nbecause you need stimulus,\nthere's skill as well, right?\nPractice.\nYou know that as much as anybody.\nDeveloping a new motor pattern requires\na lot of repetitions, right?\nYou don't need a\ntremendous amount of rest.\nThat's not, it's not\na damage thing, right,\nit's a re-patterning issue.\nSo strength training, in\nfact, if you look at again,\ntrue strength professional athletes,\nthey're going to train the same\nmuscles basically every day.\n- Wow.\n- [Andy] They're going to squat every day.\n- And is that because the\nprimary mode of adaptation\nis recruitment of these\nhigh threshold motor units?\nSo it's mainly neural.\n- No.\nSo everyone's going to say that.\nAnd this is where I get all feisty.\n- Well, I'm not saying that.\nThat was actually, there\nwas a question mark there.\n- [Andy] Okay, okay.\n- If we were online putting comments,\nthere'd be a question mark.\n- We would've fought.\nI would've blocked you.\nI'm just kidding.\n- You already blocked me.\nNo.\n- Probably twice!\nOkay.\nThe early adaptations to exercise,\nespecially strength training,\nare hedged towards the nervous system.\nNo question about it.\nPeople always say central nervous system,\nbut it's probably more peripheral, right?\nWhatever, semantics\nprobably, but pedantic.\nIt's nerve, if you train today,\ntomorrow morning you're\nnot going to wake up\nwith a actually increase in\ncontractile proteins and muscle.\nYour muscle might be a little bit bigger\ndue to some acute swelling,\nbut you could have a\npretty acute that persists,\nchange in the nervous\nsystem we'll call it,\nthat allows you to be stronger,\nlike within a couple of days.\nSustained hypertrophy is probably more\nalong the lines of four weeks.\nWe can see that right?\nWe can actually see changes\nlike in the ultrasound.\nNow you're making changes immediately,\nthat protein synthesis process\nis happening like very fast\nand it's going to last.\nIt just takes us time to\nmeasure it in terms of\na noticeable change in\nyour whole muscle size.\nSo that being said, the first\nfour weeks we typically say\nare primarily nervous system.\nAfter that, now we're starting\nto see most of the changes\ncoming from the muscle\nside of the equation.\nSo with strength development,\nit's a combination of three areas.\nIn fact, all muscle contraction\nhas these same three things.\nIt starts off with some signal, right,\nfrom somewhere in the body,\nwhether it's all the way up the top\nor at the level of the spine,\ndepending on if this is a reaction\nor an actual conscious control.\nFrom there, some signal has to\ntell the muscle to contract.\nOkay.\nSo signal is one.\nTwo it's muscular contraction.\nAnd there's a lot of variables\ninside the muscle tissue itself\nthat determine its functionality.\nAnd so if we took an individual biopsy\nand took a muscle fiber from\nyou and took one from me\nand we took those muscles out\nand put them in a Petri dish,\nand I tied one end to a force transducer\nand the other end to\na thing that pulls it,\nand we soaked it in a bath of calcium\nand a bunch of other stuff,\neven if they were the same size,\nyour fibers might contract\na lot faster than mine,\neven relative to size.\nOr not, or slower, or\nthere's various properties.\nSo the intrinsic fibers themselves\ndetermine a lot of functionality.\nFrom there, muscle fibers\ndon't cause movements.\nMuscle fibers simply contract.\nThey're all surrounded\nwith connective tissue.\nAnd that's all surrounded with\na bunch of more connective tissue.\nThat all surrounds into a muscle.\nThat muscle is then surrounded\nwith more connective tissue.\nThat all comes together\ninto a giant tendon.\nThat tendon attaches to the bone.\nIt's the pulling on those tendon\nthat actually move the bone\nthat cause human movement.\nSo that's area three.\nArea one, the nervous system,\narea two, the muscle contraction,\narea three, some sort of\nconnective tissue thing.\nChanges happen at all\nthree of those levels.\nAnd we're not even now talking,\nwhen you entered the\ndiscussion of biomechanics,\nand you changed say the\npennation angle of the muscle,\nwhich is the angle at\nwhich the muscle fibers\nlay relative to the bone, right?\nSo this is basic mechanics.\nIs it pulling perpendicular to the bone?\nIs it pulling horizontal to the\nbone, or some sort of angle?\nAll of these things\ndetermine human performance.\nSo when you're talking about again,\nthat strength development,\nyou can see tremendous improvements\nin total force production\nby manipulating all of those areas,\nand you have not touched\nchanges in muscle size.\nIf you change muscle size\nin a true sustained fashion,\nwhether this is sarcoplasmic\nor contractile proteins,\nyou have given yourself more opportunity\nto produce more force.\nIt doesn't guarantee\nyou produce more force.\nBodybuilders are not\nstronger than power lifters,\neven though they have more muscle.\nBut bodybuilders are probably\nstronger than most people.\nSo there is a relationship\nbetween muscle size and strength.\nIt's just not a one-to-one\nguaranteed ratio.\nAnd that's generally because the,\nalthough the muscle has been aided,\nthey may have not changed the\nbiomechanical considerations.\nThey may have not changed\nthe connected tissue\nnor the nervous system stuff.\nAnd so that's why we see\nthis giant relationship\nthat our value is pretty high\nbetween strength and hypertrophy,\nbut if you really want to get\nto the ends of it, it's not.\nAnd that matters to your\nactual question 10 minutes ago,\nbecause again, you can\ntrain strength daily\non the same muscle,\nbut if you want to allow\nfor that process of\ncontractile proteins to add and grow,\nthen you're going to have\nto allow some recovery.\nBecause if you go back\ninto that muscle too soon,\nyou're going to blunt the response.\nYou're going to stop it.\nYou're going to cut it off.\nYou have all kinds of\nproblems going on in the cell\nthat are going to just\nattenuate that growth response.\nSo I gave you the answer\nfor strength training.\nThe answer for hypertrophy\nis probably less than\nthree out of 10, on level of\nsoreness, so you can go again.\nIn general, you're probably\nlooking at 72 hours\nis the optimal window.\nSo if you trained your\nshoulders on Monday,\nyou probably don't want to\ntrain 'em again on Tuesday.\nIf hypertrophy's the goal.\nMaybe Wednesday, maybe Thursday's best.\nSo something like an every\ntwo to three day window\nis probably, and we know\na little bit more now\nabout why that is.\nThe gene cascade, the\nsignaling and response happens,\nwell the signaling\nhappens instantaneously,\nright, within seconds.\nThe gene cascade is probably in the,\npeaked in the four hour window,\nlike depending on which\ngene you want to look at.\nBut it's just kind of a snapshot.\nBut the protein synthesis\nprocess is 24 to 48 hour thing,\nand so it tends to kind of\nlook like let that thing finish\nand let that signal go back to baseline,\nand then hit it again.\nAnd then hit it again.\nAnd now as long as you're\nproviding the nutrients,\nthe recovery should happen and\nyou should be able to sustain\nthe same work output in\nthe training session.\nSo the stimulus stays high\nand the recovery's there,\nand you can now continue to grow muscle.\n- You mentioned 48 to 72\nhours for hypertrophy.\nWhat if, for whatever reasons,\nthe training split,\nlifestyle factors, et cetera,\nsomebody say, let's use your example,\ntrains shoulders on Monday,\nideally they would train\nthem again on Thursday,\nin their particular instance.\nWednesday or Thursday.\nBut they don't.\nThey wait until Saturday or\nSunday, for whatever reason.\nMaybe it's more compatible with their work\nand other exercise schedule.\nWhatever the reason.\nAre they actually losing\nhypertrophy that they gained,\nor they've missed a window to\ninduce further hypertrophy?\n- It's probably better to\nthink about it as the latter.\nIt's not that you've lost, it's just,\nyou've just kind of lost an opportunity\nto make more progress.\nI will save you a little bit,\nkind of going back to your HIIT program.\nThis is the original\nhigh intensity training,\nthe Mentzer thing, right?\nWhich is not.\n- The HIT with one I\nnot the high intensity interval training,\nbut high intensity training.\n- Correct.\n- Like one set\nto absolute failure.\n- Totally.\n- Maybe two.\nFor each muscle group.\n- 20 minute workouts.\n- [Andrew] Dividing your\nbody into a three-way split,\nand then literally training like\n- Smashing.\n- six times a month.\nWhich most people think\nthat is absolutely crazy.\n- Yeah.\n- There's no way\nthat's going to work.\nAnd I can tell you this.\n- It does.\n- If you are untrained,\nyou grow like a weed.\nIf you train hard enough.\n- Even if you're trained, look\nat the people Mike trained.\nHe put a lot of bodybuilders\non really high levels.\nNow they had the same similar help you had\nat that timeframe.\n- Wait, to be very clear,\nI was not taking exogenous anabolics.\nIn fact I-\n- But your endogenous was just as good.\n- It probably was.\nI wasn't measuring my levels\nthere, but I probably would.\nI grew easy and, in general,\nI tend to grow pretty\neasily from weight training.\nAnd I should say that, to Mike's credit,\nand I think this is an important message,\nthat he was the one who really said look,\nunless you're going to make a\nprofessional career out of it,\ndo not run the health hazards\nof exogenous hormones.\nAnd certainly not at your age.\nSo he deterred me from that,\nwhich was great because\nit never entered my mind.\nIt just was one of those things where\nMike Mentzer said don't do it.\nAnd he had clearly done it, right?\nAnd so he's speaking\nfrom an informed place.\nIt never entered my mind.\nBut also what was really wild is\nI was continuing to run cross country.\nAnd so there was a trade-off\nthere at some point.\n- A bit of an interference.\n- But when you're young,\nyou can get, many people\ncan get away with,\n- Totally.\n- with what at this age\nwould surely place me\ninto a state of over-training,\neven at low volume.\nWe'll see.\n- Yeah, well I mean like,\nthe whole field on interference effect\nhas changed quite a bit recently,\nwhich we could come back to if you want.\nBut just to finish out the idea here\nwith that last question.\nIf you want to take five days or six days\nin between each muscle\ngroup, you can do that.\nIn fact, if you look at the research,\nit's going to show that\nfrequency is not that important.\nIt's not that it's unimportant,\nbut it can handle changes,\nas long as you get to\nthe same total volume.\nSo you can do that.\nYou just have to do a lot\nmore work in that one workout.\nIf you care about the six\nweek, eight week thing,\nif you're like I'm in this\nfor the next 60 years,\nlike it's probably okay, right?\nBut it can be there, the\nchallenge with splitting up\nyour training sessions for\nhypertrophy into smaller numbers,\nlike once or twice a week,\nit's just difficult to get that number.\nIt's difficult to get that volume done.\nVolume-wise, the more recent\nmeta analyses are going to say\nthat you're probably looking\nat around 10 working sets\nper muscle group per week.\nSeems to be kind of the minimum threshold\nthat you're going to want to hit.\nSo if you did three sets of 10\nat your shoulders on Monday,\nthree sets of 10 shoulders\nWednesday, and three on Friday,\nthat's nine working sets.\nIf you wanted to do three\ndifferent shoulder work exercises\non Monday and hit your nine sets,\nit's not really actually going\nto be that much different.\nThe problem is 10 is kind of the minimum.\nYou probably want to look\nfor more like 15 to 20,\nand in fact, well-trained folks, 20, 25.\nThat becomes very\nchallenging in one workout.\nIn fact de functo, you're not\ngoing to be able to do it, right?\nAnd so that is where,\nit's not the frequency that\nlooks like it kills you,\nit's just the fact you have got to get,\nbecause the total driver\nof strength is intensity,\nbut the total driver of\nhypertrophy is volume.\nAssume you're taking it to fatigue, right,\nor muscular failure.\nSo it's just tough to get enough done.\nIf you can, and if you want to\nset your schedule up that way,\nlike you probably remember,\nif you do those types of training sessions\nwhere you're just going to\ncompletely exhaust a muscle,\nit's going to be sore for a while.\nYou're probably not going to come back,\nand that's sort of the\nlogic behind that was\nlet's take this thing\nto tremendous failure\nand give it six days to recover.\nIt can work, it's just not the best,\nI think is one way to think about it.\nFor most people.\n- It's also hard to do those workouts\nwithout a training partner,\nif you really want to do them correctly.\n- And stimulants and headphones\nand all kinds of other things, right?\n- Well, anyway, yeah stimulants are not,\nI certainly don't recommend those.\nIt may be a cup of coffee or\ntwo, if that's your thing, but,\nand maybe some of the safer supplements,\nbut certainly not the sorts of stimulants\nthat the guys in the '70s and '80s\nwere famous for taking.\n- No way, or still use.\n- Or still use.\nYou talked about repetition ranges,\nbroadly for strength\ntraining, so five or less.\nYou said frequency could\nbe as often as every day.\nRest two to four minutes,\nmaybe even longer\nif you're going for\none repetition maximum.\n- Yep.\n- [Andrew] For hypertrophy.\n- Sure.\n- What are the repetition\nranges that are effective,\nand what are the ones\nthat are most effective,\nif one is trying to maximize\nsome of the other variables?\nLike people don't want to\nspend more than an hour\nto 75 minutes\n- Realistic.\n- in the gym.\nBecause I think that while the rep ranges\nmight be quite broad, as\nyou alluded to earlier,\nthere's the practical, there\nare the practical constraints.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- So what repetition ranges or percent\nof one repetition maximum\nshould people consider\nwhen thinking about hypertrophy?\n- Right.\nThe quick answer there is\nanywhere between like\nfive to 30 reps per set.\nThat's going to show across the literature\npretty much equal hypertrophy gains.\nAnd we can have a really\ninteresting discussion\nabout why that is.\nBut I'm just remembering\none thing from a second ago.\nI want to give a better\nanswer for the frequency.\nYou can do every single week for strength,\nor every single day for strength.\nIf you want though\nlike what's probably\nminimally viable, two,\ntwice per week per muscle.\nSo hamstrings strength, twice per week.\nThat's a good number to get\nmost people really strong.\n- Okay.\n- You can do every single day.\nYou don't need to though.\nSo I want to make sure that,\nlike I wasn't saying you\nhave to train a muscle\n85% every single day to get it strong.\nTwo is a good number, three is great,\nbut probably even two is really effective.\n- Got it.\nAnd this explains the\nhigh frequency of training\nfor strength athletes\nthat's always mystified me.\n- Yeah.\n- And the very long workouts\nmake sense, because very long-\n- They're going to even train twice a day.\nEven they'll just squat,\nin the morning squat and\nthe afternoon, every day.\n- With their eating and their sleeping,\nthey probably don't have\ntime for anything else.\n- Well, that's why they're pros.\nSo it's their job, right?\nThat's what they do.\nSo yeah, your hypertrophy.\nStrength training programming\nis somewhat complicated,\nright, because of,\nit's not the danger,\nbut you're going to have to pay,\none way or the other, right?\nThe risk is a little bit\nhigher 'cause the load's higher\nand you have to be a little bit\nmore technically proficient.\nWhen it comes to hypertrophy training,\nthe way I like to explain it\nis it's kind of idiot-proof.\nThe programming is idiot-proof,\nthe work is hard though.\nSo here's your range.\nAnywhere between five reps and 30.\nCan you hit somewhere in there, perfect,\nit's all equally effective,\nyou can't screw that up.\nThe only caveat for hypertrophy is\nyou have to take it to muscular failure.\n- And you need enough\nrest for the adaptation\nand protein synthesis to occur.\n- Yep.\n- Yeah.\n- And if you recover faster,\nyou can maybe do it more frequently.\nAnd if you don't, maybe less frequently.\n- By that logic, should\npeople perhaps experiment\nand figure out what repetition\nrange allows them to recover,\nin concert with the training frequency\nthat they can do consistently.\n- My recommendation is I think\nyou should actually set your,\nuse the repetition range as\na way to have some variation,\nbecause most people don't\nwant to go in the gym\nto do three sets of 10.\nThey're going to get\nvery bored very quickly.\nAnd so I think you should\nactually intentionally\nchange the rep schemes for\nsimple sake of having more fun.\nIt is a very different challenge.\nThe mechanisms that are inducing\nhypertrophy are different,\nbut there's only a\nmaximum amount of growth\nthat one can get, right?\nAnd so you have, as best we think it now,\nand some people actually\nwill espouse that we know\nreally clearly about the\nmechanisms of muscle hypertrophy,\nwhich we don't.\nIt's still very much a guessing game,\nbut the three most likely drivers\nare one, metabolic stress,\ntwo, mechanical tension, and\nthen three, muscular damage.\nYou don't have to have all three.\nOne is sufficient.\nYou can have a little bit of\none or two, and you can cut it,\nso you get it to play here.\nWe've already talked\nabout the muscular damage.\nAgain, it's very clear,\nmore damage is not better.\nBut it is somewhat a decent proxy, right?\nLike again, a little\nbit of soreness is good.\nJust don't get so sore\nit's compromising your\ntotal volume, right?\nMechanical tension is\nkind of like strength.\nAnd this is why if you do\neven sets of five or eight,\nand you're kind of close\nto that strength range,\nyou will gain a little bit of muscle.\nIt's not optimal muscle gain,\nbut you're going to gain some\nbecause everything in these,\nlike physiology didn't\ncut off at four reps\nand then five reps is a\ndifferent thing, right?\nIt's always a blend, so think\nof it as like a fading curve.\nAs you get closer to the\nend, it fades less effective.\nAs you get closer to the\nmiddle, it's more effective.\nAnywhere between eight reps per set to 30,\nit's equally effective.\nPast 30, it's going to blend out.\nPast eight to five to four to\nthree, it's going to blend,\nyou know, lesser there.\nSo metabolic stress is one,\nthe damage is the other,\nor sorry, mechanical tension\nis the one that's heavy.\nMuscle damage is the other one.\nThe third one is metabolic stress.\nAnd this is, again, a bit of an area\nof scientific contention,\nbut something's there.\nI know something's there.\nWe're just kind of fumbling to figure out\nwhat exactly it is.\nAnd this is, metabolic\nstress is the burn, right?\nIt's there.\nIt's why blood flow restriction\ntraining probably works.\nThat's done very light, so\nthere's no mechanical tension,\nthere's very little damage,\nbut somehow it induces a\ngood amount of hypertrophy.\n- [Andrew] Very painful.\n- Oh boy.\n- I tried this.\nI have a friend, former special operator\nwho lives out on the East\nCoast and took me through\na blood flow restriction\ntraining protocol in a park.\nAnd I don't think I actually cried, but.\n- You probably did.\n- But I might've cried out once or twice.\nIt was unbelievable, especially\nthe lower body movements.\nNow it was a humid day,\nI'll claim a little bit of jet lag, but\n- No, no.\n- it was brutal.\nIt was really brutal.\nAnd I also-\n- Do it on the best day of your\nlife, and it's still brutal.\n- Okay, well,\n- Still brutal.\n- that makes me feel\na little bit better.\nIt was intense, and people\nshould know that it is important\nto use the proper cuffs for these things.\nI don't have any relationship\nto any of the companies\nthat sell these cuffs.\nBut the reason is that\nyou actually need to block\nparticular avenues of blood flow.\nYou can't simply cinch off a muscle.\nYou can't tourniquet a muscle and train.\n- Not a good idea.\n- You can actually\nkill yourself that way.\n- Yeah, you can get a blood clot.\n- Yeah.\nAnd so if you're interested in\nblood flow restriction training,\nI imagine you have some\ncontent about this,\nor will at some point,\nbut also there are resources\nonline that people can look up.\nA question about hypertrophy\ntraining I think.\nMany people are wondering\nabout train to failure,\nor don't train to failure.\nAssuming good form.\n- Yeah, okay, assuming good form, great.\nThe answer is both.\nSo you want to train to failure,\nbut you don't need to\ngo to extreme failure.\nSo you don't need to\nnecessarily go to that like,\na partner has to lift\nthe barbell off my chest.\nBut you have to get close.\nYou have to drive either\nheavy, stress damage, right, or pump.\nAnd so a really easy practical\nway to think about this.\nI heard Mike Israetel,\nwho runs a company called\nRenaissance Periodization,\nyears ago, outlined this at a NSCA talk.\nAnd it was beautiful, and I thought\nthis is the most eloquent\nway to explain the context\nabout training for hypertrophy.\nSo I want you to look for\nthree things in your workout,\nand let's say that you want\na particular muscle to grow.\nLet's say you want your\nglutes to get larger.\nOkay.\nWhen you're doing your\nglute exercises, number one,\nare you feeling the glute contract?\nOkay, it doesn't have to be there,\nbut that's a good sign if it is.\nOkay, let's say I didn't\nreally feel my glute contract.\nI felt it more in my quads or my back.\nOkay.\nDid you feel a big pump afterwards?\nNo, I didn't really feel a pump there\neither wards or during.\nOkay, great.\nNumber three.\nNext day, did you feel a little bit of\nsoreness there at all?\nNo, I didn't.\nWell, that's a very good indicator,\nyou didn't feel it during the workout,\nyou felt no sort of pump,\nand it didn't get sore.\nDon't expect much growth.\nDidn't happen.\n- You distributed the work\nacross a bunch of muscle groups.\n- Most likely other muscle\ngroups were too involved, right,\nespecially if you're like, no,\nbut man, my back got really.\nWell that's a really good\nindication of telling you\nwhat the hell was moving.\nAnd so in terms of targets,\nif you were to put,\nagain, a one to 10 scale,\nhow much should I feel it burning during?\nAnything less than a three, okay,\nit's probably not doing much, right?\nBut it doesn't, like seven is not,\na 10 is not better than seven.\nYou need to feel it, but\nit doesn't have to be like,\noh my gosh, I'm dying here.\nSoreness, same barometer, right?\nSo if you can get like\nthree, three and three,\nyou're probably in a pretty good spot.\nFive, five, and five is maybe better,\nbut you don't need to go much past that.\nSo I want you to feel the\nmuscle group either working,\nor if you're like I didn't feel it much,\nI didn't really get a pump\nbut the next day it got really sore,\nwell then you're still on a good path.\nAgain, really sore isn't\nlike ooh, a little tender,\nbut next day it's okay.\nDay after that, I could train, no problem.\nThat's really what you want to go after.\nAnd in terms of understanding,\nis this likely to produce\nsome growth or not?\n- Excellent, excellent.\nVery clear parameters and recommendations\nI know are benefiting me, and\nwill benefit a lot of people.\nIf you'd be willing to\nthrow out a few sort of\nsets and rep parameters that\ncould act as broad guidelines\nfor people who want to explore further.\nI realize that with all\nthese modifiable variables,\nthat there's no one size\nfits all for strength.\nI love this five to 30 for hypertrophy,\nthat's a pretty vital thing.\nI don't think I've ever done\na 30 rep set of anything.\nBut now that you've thrown that out there,\nI see it as a bit of a challenge.\n- You want to know\nwhat's awesome about 30?\nYou're going to get an insane pump.\nYou're going to burn like crazy.\nBut you won't get super sore.\nBecause the mechanical tension's so low.\nIt's so light.\nSo you can get away with\nthose things and you,\nit's hard because your\nmind is going to wander.\nYou're going to get it like rep 20,\nand you're going to be like\nI'm done, and you're like no,\nthere's a lot left here to get to 30.\nWhere like a set of 10 is much easier,\nyou're just like, okay,\ntwo more, two more.\nSet of 30's like, I got 16 more.\nIt's awful, but you're not-\n- Just the counting is work.\n- It's terrible, right,\nand people tend to just\nkind of like check out.\nSo 30 is possible, but\na little bit extreme.\nBut I would recommend all of 'em.\nLike it's a really fun\nplay, you can do different,\nin the same workout too, by the way.\nLike you could do one set of 10 pushups\nand then take a little break\nand then do a set of 25.\nYou can mix and match these things.\nThere's no magic recipe that\nhas to happen for all those,\nor do it different.\nSo Mondays are my sets of 10 days.\nWednesdays are my set of 20 days.\nAnd Fridays are my set of 30 days.\nAnd you can have all kinds of fun there,\nand it's hard to screw up.\n- Great.\nI love, that phrase is always reassuring.\nSo for strength, is there\na sets and reps protocol\nthat is pretty surefire?\n- So a way to just think\nabout a really fast answer\nfor power, well speed, power and strength,\nis what I just call the\nthree to five concept.\nAll right?\nSo pick three to five exercises.\nIf you're feeling better that\nday, choose on the higher end.\nIf you're feeling less that day,\nor you have a shorter\ntimeframe to train, go less.\nSo this would be three sets,\nor three exercises rather,\nor five exercises the most.\nSo three to five exercises.\nDo three to five reps, three to five sets,\ntake three to five\nminutes rest in between,\nand do it three to five times a week.\nSo that can be as little\nas three sets of three,\nfor three exercises, three times a week.\nThat's a 20 minute workout,\nthree times a week.\nIt can be as high as five sets\nof five for five exercises,\nfive days a week.\nSo it's very broad and allows\npeople to still stay within\nthe domains of strength and power,\nwhile still being able to move\nand contour towards their lifestyle\nand soreness and time\nand all those things.\nThe only differentiator\nto pay attention to\nbetween power and strength, is intensity.\nSo if you want strength,\nthis is now 85% plus of your max, right?\nAnd if you want power, it\nneeds to be a lot lighter,\n'cause you need to move more towards\nthe velocity end of the spectrum,\nbecause power is strength\nmultiplied by speed.\nSo while getting stronger by\ndefinition can help power,\nyou probably want to\nspend more of your time\nin the 40% to 70% range,\nlike plus or minus.\nSo that's it.\nBoth of them, conceptually\nthey'll work, everything else,\nthe exercise, the reps, the frequency,\nall that can be still in\nthe three to five range.\nJust change the intensity,\ndepending on which outcome you want.\n- The nervous system obviously plays\nan important role at the level of\nnerves controlling the\ncontraction of muscle fibers.\nBut of course, we have\nthese upper motor neurons,\nwhich are the ones that\nreside in our brain,\nthat control the lower motor\nneurons, that control muscle.\nAnd this takes us into the realm of\nwhere the mind is at during\na particular movement.\nAnd to me, this is not an abstract thing.\nI can imagine doing workouts\nthat are mainly focused on strength,\nor mainly focused on hypertrophy,\nand in the case of strength,\nam I trying to move weights,\nand when I'm trying to\ngenerate hypertrophy,\nam I trying to, quote\nunquote, challenge muscles?\nIn other words, if I'm just\ntrying to move a weight\naway from my body, you\nknow, pushing a bench press\nor an overhead press,\nI don't know that I want\nmy mind thinking about\nthe contraction of my medial delts.\nI think I want my mind in\ngetting the weight overhead\nwith the best proper form.\nBest, excuse me, and proper form.\nAnd certainly with hypertrophy training,\nbest and proper form is going\nto be the target as well.\nBut that simple, or I should\nsay subtle mental shift,\nchanges the patterns of\nnerve fiber recruitment.\nSo can we say to get stronger\nfocus on moving weights,\nstill with proper form and safely,\nand to get hypertrophy focused\non challenging muscles,\nstill with proper form and safely.\n- It's very fair.\nYeah, as a snapshot answer,\nit is a very fair thing to think about.\nIntentionality matters for both.\nIn other words, if you look\nat some interesting science\nthat's been done on power\ndevelopment and speed development,\nthe intent to move is\nactually more important\nthan the actual movement velocity.\nSo if you're doing say\nsomething for power or strength,\nand you're doing just\nenough to get the bar up,\nthat will result in less\nimprovements in strength\nthan even if you're moving\nat the exact same speed,\nbut you're intending to move faster.\nAnd this is one of the reasons\nwhy good coaching matters.\nSo if you're coaching an athlete\nthrough a power workout especially,\nand they're doing enough to just lift 50%\nof their one rep at max,\nit's not going to generate\nas much speed development\nas them trying to move that\nbar as fast as they can,\neven if the net result is\nthe same barbell velocity.\nTurns out nerves matter.\n- That's a, I mean I was\nabout to say amazing,\nbut as a neuroscientist,\nif I say amazing that nerves matter.\nWhat's amazing to me is,\nif I understand correctly,\nwhat you're saying is that\neven if the bar is moving\nat the same speed, same weight,\nif my internal representation,\nmy thoughts are,\nI'm trying to move this\nas fast as possible,\nversus I'm just trying to\nget the bar away from me,\nand get the weight up, I'm\ngoing to get different outcomes.\n- Yep, this is quality of work, right?\nThis is, did you do enough\nto just check off a box\nor did you actually strive\nfor adaptation, right?\nSimilar concept actually\nworks for hypertrophy,\nin terms of there is a\nhandful of very recent studies\nthat have looked at what we'll call\nthe mind muscle connection.\nAnd this is doing things\nlike imagine a bicep curl,\nand you're simply looking\nat and watching your biceps,\nand you're thinking about\ncontracting it harder.\nEven though you execute\nthe same repetitions\nat the same exact intensity,\ninitial indications are\nthe mind body connection\nare going to result in\nmore growth than not.\n- You just gave authorization for people\nto look at their muscles\n- Please do.\n- contracting in the gym.\n- Please do.\n- Oh my.\n- Yeah, of course, right?\n- But the selfie is still ruled out.\n- I'd rather you look at\nyour muscles in your phone.\nSo I'm fine with it.\nThose are initial.\nWe don't have a large depth\nof research to support that.\nAnd maybe some stuff\nwill come and counter it.\nBut it does, it matches\nwhat folks in that community\nhave been saying for a\nvery long time, right?\nThere's actually some stuff\non simply flexing in between.\nSo if you've ever seen a body builder,\nthey'll do their set of bicep curls\nand then they'll get out and\nthey'll flex and they'll check.\nAnd they're literally, this\nis what Arnold did, right?\nThis is, if you go back\nto pumping in iron.\n- Or college weight rooms, I should say.\n- Right.\n- And for some reason\nthere's something about that age group.\n- Yeah.\n- That there's a lot of\nchecking of biceps in\ncollege weight rooms,\nfor reasons that escape me.\n- If you ever interact with my wife,\nlike she will be the first to tell you,\nI cannot walk past the\nmirror without like,\nI'm checking something out.\n- That you can't,\n- I can't.\n- or that she can't?\n- I can't.\n- Okay.\n- Not her me.\n- Got it.\n- [Andy] Like I'm the one\nthat cannot walk past.\n- All right, well then I'll be careful\nnot to disparage-\n- It has nothing to do with the\nhypertrophy, but I just like\nI'm a muscle guy, so\nI'm always like thinking\nand tinkering, or whatever.\nBut yeah, it is, I think it's\nvery much worth your time\nto do a higher quality training session.\nBe more intentional, be present,\nthan just executing\nthe same exact workout.\nI think that's globally very\nclear to be to your advantage.\nSo if you're thinking like, I'm going to,\nlike, I don't want to work out today.\nI got all this going on,\nor I'm tired or whatever,\nI'm just going to do the workout\nI know and get through it.\nOkay.\nIf you can go, you know what though,\nlike, I'm going to cut 15\nminutes out of this thing.\nI'm going to get my head right.\nI'm going to go get two 20\nminutes of quality work done,\nthat's your best option by far.\n- You alluded to the fact that\neven just looking at a particular muscle\nmight benefit in terms\nof the number of fibers\nyou can recruit, or its\npotential for hypertrophy.\nI've heard before, and I\ncertainly have experienced that\nmuscles that for whatever reason,\ngenetics or sports that\none played, et cetera,\nmuscles that we find that we can contract\nto the point of almost a\nslightly painful contraction,\nseem to grow more readily\nthan muscles that we\ncan't recruit very easily.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- And the reason I mentioned\nsports that we played earlier\nis, I mean, you just have to\nwatch the Olympics to see that,\nswimmers obviously are very\ngood at engaging their lats.\nYou look at the gymnasts,\nthey seem to be very good\nat engaging everything.\n- Yeah.\n- And they go through\na huge number of different\ndynamic movements,\nso that explains that.\nSo I find that, you\nknow, if people say, oh\nI can't get stronger in this,\nor my whatever body part is weak,\nin terms of its inability\nto engage hypertrophy.\n- Yeah, I see where you're going.\n- That oftentimes that can\nbe because of an inability\nto engage those upper motor neurons,\nto deliberately isolate those muscles.\nAre there ways that\npeople can learn to engage\nparticular muscle groups\nmore effectively over time,\nfor sake of hypertrophy or strength,\nor for cases of trying to overcome\ninjury potential or injury,\nbecause imbalances are\nbad across the board.\n- Yeah, this is actually very common,\nand I think everyone has\nprobably gone through this.\nThere's some part that\nyou just can't get going,\nfor me, that was the lats.\nThat was the rhomboids.\nSo my back muscles.\nFor years, I couldn't activate\nmy lats or my rhomboids.\nThese are the muscle groups that connect\nyour shoulder blades.\nSo if you try to squeeze your\nshoulder blades together,\nthat set of muscles there\nare called your rhomboids.\nYour lats of course are more vertical\nand pull you kind of up and down.\nAnd no matter how many lat\npull downs I did, bent rows,\npull ups, I could never\nsee any development there.\nNo increase in strength.\nAnd it took me probably\na decade to figure out\nhow the hell do I actually\nget these things on.\nIn fact, if you'd have asked me,\neven in my college years as\na college football player,\nhey flex your lats,\nlike show me your lats,\nyou would've seen no movement there.\nWhen I was doing a pull up,\nin that particular case,\nthe only way I could get the bar to move\nwas by using my biceps, right?\nSo it's a synergist muscle,\nit's supposed to be a\nsecondary or tertiary muscle\nin that movement, but\nfor me it was primer,\nbecause of my over strength in my biceps\ncoupled with my lack of\nactivation in the lats.\nSo you're compensating the same movement.\nActually kind of an easy\nway to think about this is\nimagine doing a bent row.\nSo imagine you're bent\nover kind of at a 45 degree\nor a horizontal angle,\nand you're going to pull a barbell\nto your belly button, right?\nNow you can actually do\nthat exact same movement\nwith very little back muscle activation,\nby simply flexing your elbows more.\nAnd so you think the barbell's\ngoing all the way down,\nit's coming all the way\nup to touching my belly.\nAnd you think you're doing\na great back development exercise.\nWhen in fact,\nbecause of the way that\nyou're executing the movement,\nyou're getting very\nlittle back development.\nAnd this is a really good example\nof why someone has done\na specific exercise\nmany, many, many times,\nbut yet failed to see\ndevelopment in a muscle group.\nWhich goes back to earlier\npart of our conversation,\nwhich is why exercises themselves\ndo not determine the adaptation.\nIt's the execution that matters, right?\nIt's the technique, it's the rep range,\nall of those are going to\ndetermine your actual result.\nSo if anytime you're banging\nyour head against the wall\nand thinking like why am I\nnot getting movement here,\ngrowth or strength or whatever,\nit's almost one of those,\nit's guaranteed to be one\nof those areas, right?\nYou're probably not getting\nthe muscle groups to activate.\nIn that particular example,\njust because we're here,\ntry imagine doing that bent row.\nInstead of pulling the\nbarbell to your belly,\nsqueeze your shoulder\nblades together first,\nas far as they can possibly go,\nand then bring your elbows up\nwithout changing the angle of your elbow.\nSo in other words,\nwithout bringing your hand\ncloser to your shoulder.\nSo keep that same angle\nand come up as high as you possibly can,\nand then finish out the movement.\nThat's going to guarantee a utilization\nfirst of the back muscles\nand a finishing with\nthe biceps at the end,\nwhich is how that movement\nis supposed to go.\nSo how do you coach into that?\nWell, it can be a number of things.\nWhenever I'm diagnosing movement quality,\nI look for a handful of things,\nbut very first one is awareness.\nYou'd be surprised how many folks,\nwhen you just simply tell them\nthat muscle group right there,\nand maybe you give 'em a tactical prompt,\nso you touch it, or you\nput something against it.\nThis is actually why, sorry\nI'm jumping all over the place,\nbut this is why things\nlike a belt work very well\nfor actually increasing\nabdominal strength.\nSo a misconception out there is\nif you wear like a belt\nwhen you're lifting,\nthen the belt kind of\ndoes all the work for you\nand your abs get weaker.\nThat can happen, but the exact\nopposite can happen as well.\nSo if you take a belt, for example,\nand you cinch it down really tight,\nand then you just completely\ndisregard your midsection,\nyou will see a loss of\nstrength in your midsection\nbecause now the belt is doing the work.\nBut if you put the belt on just\na little bit, kind of tight,\nto where you get some sensory feedback,\nand you think about\nusing that belt as a way\nto activate the core musculature,\nyou will actually see a higher,\nif we look at like EMG activation,\nthe core muscles would\nbe activated higher,\nto a greater extent, than\nwhen the belt is off.\n- [Andrew] Because of\nproprioceptive feedback.\n- Hundred percent.\n- And for those that are wondering\nwhat proprioceptive feedback is.\nProprioceptive feedback is that\nthere are nerves that\nextend out to the muscles\nthat control muscle contractions,\nbut then there are sensory\ninputs from the skin and muscle\nthat go back into the nervous system,\nand those work in concert,\nand that feedback is proprioceptive.\nI think it literally\ntranslates to a knowledge of\nwhere one's limbs are,\nand what's happening\non those limbs.\n- In space, yeah.\n- I've seen, I don't\nhave a training partner,\nbut I've seen in gyms where\nsomeone will be training\nand someone will tap the muscle\nof the person who's\ndoing the work, in order,\nthis is consensual tapping\nof other people's muscles,\nnot walking around\n- Please.\n- touching people's\nmuscles, please.\nThat to provide that\nproprioceptive feedback,\nso that the person doing the\nexercises becomes more aware\nof the muscle that they're\nsupposed to be training.\nAnd it seems that that's\nprobably an effective practice.\n- Yeah.\nI'll give you two examples.\nI'll go to the back with\nthat pulling movement,\nbut then I'll stay in\nthe belt really quickly.\nSo a very easy example that you\ncan do right now, listening,\nand I learned this from Brian McKenzie,\nour mutual friend, right?\nSo if you take your hands and open 'em up,\nlike you make an L with both your hands,\nand now take those and\nput 'em around your waist,\njust above your hip bones.\nNow what I want you to do is\npress out as hard as you can\non your hands with your core.\nAnd you can feel a lot of core activation.\nAnd most people think core activation\nis the front of your stomach, right?\nYour six pack.\nWhat you need to do is create\na cylinder around your back.\nSo it's the front, it's the\nside, and it's the back.\nSo if you take your two\nfingers, point them.\nNow put them just outside\nyour belly button.\nCan you move your fingers by\njust moving your ab muscles?\n90% of people can do yes.\nSame exact thing.\nNow go to that same position,\njust above what's called your ASIS,\nso your anterior superior iliac spine,\nright up that front of your\nhip bone, right in the front.\nCan you now move?\nGreat, 50% of people are not\ngoing to get any movement there.\n- Really?\n- Take your thumb and go\nright above your PSIS.\n- My what?\n- PSIS.\nPosterior superior\niliac spine.\n- Okay.\n- Right, now can you move?\nMost likely no.\n- Sort of if I do a\nmini low back extension.\n- Don't.\nJust with your core musculature.\n- Barely.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- Maybe-\n- 90% of people can't.\nIf you can't perform that contraction,\nyou can't stabilize your spine.\nSo only way to get\nstabilization in your spine\nis then to go through hyper-extension.\nAnd now that's a compression strategy\nyou're putting on your spine.\nIt's better than rounding your back,\nlike in going forward,\nbut over-extension is not great either.\nSo you want to be able\nto flex the musculature\nin a cylindric fashion,\nso you have control.\nSo if you go back to our very first thing,\nand with your hands open,\nand you put 'em right here,\nand if you're like I can't get activation,\nif you pay attention to your thumb, right?\nNow, just move your thumb.\nAnd now you see activation\nback there, fight?\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Boom.\nNow if you can imagine turning\nthat on just a little bit,\nand now notice how I\ncan do this, by the way,\nat the same time I'm talking.\nIf you have to go [gasping]\nwe don't have control, right?\nSo you have to be able to\nseparate breath from brace.\nSo now, if I can put myself in a position,\nand Kelly Starrett has always said 20%.\nGive me 20% activation\nhere, and now I can squat,\nI can hinge, I can jump.\nI don't need to be locked down\nto a hundred percent scream\nto be able to brace my spine.\nIt's going to be ineffective and wasteful.\nI want to be here.\nWell, a belt provides that\nproprioceptive feedback\nwhere I can put it on 20%,\nand it just is a reminder,\nif I don't press against the belt,\nthe belt slides and\nfalls down a little bit,\n'cause it's not on super tight.\nIf it's on so dang tight, it's\ndoing the work, and I forget.\nSo we just want a little\nbit of feedback there.\nSame thing with your upper back.\nIf you're having a\ndifficult time activating\nthose rhomboids or those lats,\nsomeone can do a simple thing\nwhere they take their finger,\nput it right between your shoulder blades,\nand you just tell them things\nlike hey, squeeze my finger.\nSqueeze my finger.\nAs you're doing your bent\nrow, or your pull down,\nyou can touch the lat.\nYou can do just visualization stuff.\nSo just imagine like a 3D\nrendering of that muscle group,\nand you're watching that\nmuscle group contract.\nIt's very powerful, and\nvery effective to do it.\nSo a touch, a visual,\nall this stuff can help,\nget people to activate.\nOutside of simple awareness,\ntypically eccentric overload\nis a very effective way\nfor activation of a\ndifficult to target muscle.\n- So the lowering of the bar,\nor the lowering of the weight.\n- The movement of the\nweight away from the body.\nIt's not necessarily was lowering.\n'Cause that kind of depends\non what muscle group\n- Right, sure.\n- you're doing, right?\n- [Andrew] I misspoke, yeah.\n- Things like a pull up.\nOkay, so if I'm going to do a pull up\nand I have poor lat activation,\nI can still get the pull\nup muscle movement executed\nby contraction of the\nbiceps and things like that.\nHowever, to make the movement simpler,\nI'm going to go all the way to the top.\nSo imagine stepping on a box or something\ngoing all the way to that\ntop of that pull up position.\nAnd starting from there,\nand I want you to simply\nlower it under control.\nAnd so you're just simply\nbreaking the movement down\ninto smaller pieces,\nthat allow you to focus\non the execution more.\nIt's going to be great,\neccentrics are great for\nstrength development,\nvery good for hypertrophy,\nand allow you to focus on control.\nI'm willing to bet a huge\npercentage of you out there\nwho're like I've never had a sore lat,\nyou know, I've done a lot of\npull ups and things like that,\nif you do that eccentric only\nyou'll probably wake up the\nnext day going, oh gosh,\nI feel it there.\nAnd that's a sign,\neven if you didn't feel it in the workout,\nbut it got a little sore the\nnext day, keep down that path.\nAnd then eventually you'd\nbe able to do a concentric,\nmaybe take a break.\nMaybe do an isometric, where\nyou just hold that position.\nAnd eventually work\nthat into a progression\nwhere you can do the\nconcentric, eccentric,\nand isometric portions,\nand get activation.\nSo that might take you six weeks.\nMay take you six months.\nBut that's generally a pretty\ngood strategy for learning\nhow to activate a muscle group.\n- Terrific suggestions.\nIs it true that eccentric\nemphasized movements\nmight require a little\nbit longer recovery,\nor they lead to more soreness than\n- They can.\n- concentric movements?\n- Yeah, they typically can,\nbut they're also higher force output.\nSo very good for strength development.\nBut they're going to lead\non average to more soreness.\nSo more potential for\nintracellular disruption\nthat is going to be associated with pain.\nThere's not as much, people\nlike to explain muscle soreness\nas a result of microtrauma\nand micro tears in the muscle.\nAnd that can happen,\nbut that's not the norm.\nMost of the time, it is things\nlike disruption of calcium\nthat's going to lead to excessive\nswelling, excessive pressure,\nand that's going to be then\ntranslated as extreme pain.\nSo that's probably explaining\nmore muscle soreness\nthan actually microtrauma.\n- Terrific.\nI was going to get to breathing\nlater, but maybe just for now,\nif we can do a brief little\nforay into breathing,\nas it relates to weight training.\nIs there a prescriptive for how to breathe\nduring resistance training?\nHere I'm thinking with weights,\nnot necessarily body\nweight, only movements,\nalthough I suppose it could be,\nthat applies 75% of the\ntime to 75% of the people.\nWhat I was taught, and I'm\nhoping you're going to tell me\nthis was wrong, 'cause then there might be\nmore benefits awaiting me,\nis that I should exhale on the effort\nand inhale on the lesser\neffort portion of an exercise.\nIs that true?\nIs there a better way to breathe?\n- There is a better way to think about it.\nSo number one, if you\ncan breathe and brace,\nthen this conversation goes away.\nSo if you can maintain intramuscular,\nintra-abdominal pressure while breathing,\nthen I don't really care when you breathe.\nVery challenging to do\nat very heavy weights.\nIf we flag this on two\nareas of a paradigm.\nParadigm one over here, you're\ngoing to do a set of 30,\nand you're going to do front squats\nwhere a barbell is sitting on your throat.\nIf you don't take a breath,\nlike this is going to end\none way and one way only.\nYou passing out.\nClearly has to be some breathing strategy.\nThe other end of the spectrum is\nlet's say you're going\nto do a vertical jump.\nYou don't need any amount of breath there,\nit's never going to happen, right?\nThe question is, what about in the middle?\nRight?\nSo I'm doing some sort of\nstrength training there.\nWell, number one, make sure you're braced\nand then you can get away with\nless need to worry about it.\nIn general, a decent strategy\nis to maintain a breath hold\nduring the lowering, or eccentric,\nor most dangerous part of the movement,\nand then you can exhale\non the concentric portion.\nSo if the bench presses are\nexample, if you held in, braced,\nlowered it under control,\nand now started the\nconcentric pushing away force,\nand then you wanted to take an expiration,\nduring the last half of\nthe concentric portion,\nthat's an okay strategy.\nIf you're going to do a single rep,\nyou don't need to worry about it.\nYou can just avoid or\nomit breathing entirely.\nYou're going to be just fine.\nIf you're doing more than that,\nespecially three to four\nto five to seven, eight,\nyou're going to have to have\nsome breathing strategy.\nA very common one is\nprobably every third breath\nI'm going to do like [gasping],\nexhale on the third.\nReset and re-breathe.\nSomething like that.\nIf you feel like you need\nto breathe after every one,\nthat's okay, but it's\ngoing to get wasteful,\n'cause you have to take\ntime in between reps\nof sitting there.\nIf it's a squat, that's\ndifferent, versus a deadlift,\nif you're resting at the bottom.\nSo there is a little bit of game here.\nSo in general though, is that 75,\n75 kind of really thrown\nout, you threw out.\nBreathe in, do the lowering,\nand exhale on the out.\nIf you have to less reps,\ndon't worry about it.\nMore reps, then you need to come up with\nsome sort of breathing strategy.\n- How about breathing in between sets,\nand maybe even after the workout?\n- Yeah.\n- This is something I think\na lot of people overlook,\nlike and because the,\nit is the case that\nrecovery has to do both with\nthe specific activation and to muscles,\nand the nervous system,\nbut also the attacks on the nervous system\ncan also take place between sets.\nI mean, if you're really\ngeared up between sets\nand you get adrenaline, you know,\nas high in between sets or close to it\nas you are during your sets,\nyou can imagine that the\nrecovery would take longer.\nOr at least that you're\nnot spending adrenaline\nin the most efficient way,\nif there is such a thing.\n- Yeah, fair.\nYou're not going to see any\nathlete that I work with\njust breathe in between.\nWhether it's in between\ninnings or in between rounds,\nevery single one of them's going\nto go back, sit in the stool,\nand they're going to immediately\nbe into a breathing routine.\nA very intentional one.\nThey're a little bit\ndifferent for every athlete,\ndepending on the sport.\nEven a PGA golfer, there's going\nto be a, we just hit our ball,\nwe're moving to the next one,\nwe're going to go into\nour breathing strategy.\nEvery one of 'em.\nIt's a huge area of potential\nbenefit and consequence,\nif you're just ignoring it.\nIn general, we want to do\nany sort of calming breath,\nwe want to restore.\nIt depends on what we're combating.\nAre we combating low oxygen or high CO2?\nSo that strategy is going to\nbe a little bit different.\nBut in general, that is\na huge time opportunity\nto get better.\nIn fact, people can go back and listen to\nsome of your earlier episodes\nwhere you talked about,\nwell you have spoken about,\nI think, on this show,\nwhen neuroplasticity works,\nand if you're losing that\nopportunity, post-exercise,\nyou're leaving gains on\nthe table if you will.\nSo not only are you going to see\nthe athletes that I work with\nmostly have a breathing\nstrategy in competition.\nWe're not going to just\nfinish a workout, high five,\ndrink water, and walk out of the gym.\nThere will be a down regulation strategy\nthat is heavily involved with\nsome sort of light control,\nas well as breath control.\nThe individual prescription on that,\nthere's a ton of variation\nwith what you can do.\nThe easiest thing is do\nsomething that calms you down.\nMost likely that's going\nto be moved towards\nas much nasal breathing\nas you can possibly do.\nAnd a really easy rule of\nthumb is a double exhale length\nrelative to inhale.\nSo if you need to take a\nlike four second inhale,\ndouble that time and breathe\nout for eight seconds.\nBox breathing is fine.\nSo equal inhale, equal hold,\nequal exhale, equal hold.\nSo four second inhale, four second hold,\net cetera, et cetera.\nA triangle is fine too.\nThere's a lot of ways, you\ncan get really complicated,\nlike what Brian McKenzie will do, and Rob,\nand those guys have, you\ncan get all kinds of systems\nfor inhale exhale control\nand it can be optimized.\nBut some strategy of calm.\nWe're going to almost always\nput you on your back or close,\nand then we're going to cover light.\nWe can do some, like we've\ndone actually a number of\nmusical interventions as well,\nbut you can just as simple\nas sit down in a locker room\nif you have to, and just\nbreathe for five minutes.\nThat alone is going to be productive.\n- That's great.\nIf you're breathing in the\nlocker room for five minutes,\nI suggest closing your eyes,\nor you get some funny looks,\nand if, you'll still get funny looks,\nbut you won't see people looking at you.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- I love this, and I started doing this\nbecause you and Brian McKenzie\ninformed me about this,\nand it completely changed\nthe rate of recovery for me.\nI realized that I was leaving workouts,\nboth endurance workouts and\nstrength hypertrophy workouts\nfeeling great, but looking at my phone,\ngetting right into email and meetings.\n- Ooh, ooh, rough,\n- Not concentrating\non my breathing.\nAnd all I did was to introduce\na, on your recommendation,\na five minute down regulation.\nSo exhale emphasized breathing,\na bunch of different varieties,\nphysiological size, box breathing,\nexhale emphasized, twice as\nlong as the inhale component\nfor five minutes.\nAnd I noticed two things.\nOne, I recovered more\nquickly, workout to workout,\nno question about it.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- The numbers told me that.\nAnd the other is that I used\nto have this dip in energy\nthat would occur three or four\nhours after a hard workout.\nAnd I always thought that\nhad to do with the fact that\nI'd generally eaten a meal\nat some point post-workout.\nTurns out it wasn't the meal at all.\n- Yeah.\n- It's that adrenaline ramp\nup during the workouts,\nI wasn't clamping that at the end.\nAnd so I think eventually it's crashed,\nand then three or four hours later\nI'm having a hard time even\nreading what's on the screen\non my computer, thinking\nmaybe it's the screen.\nMaybe it was what I ate for lunch.\nTurns out, the down regulations allowed me\nto work through the afternoon\nwith no issues whatsoever.\nIt's really been quite powerful,\nand so I'm grateful to you for that.\nAnd I think this is something\nthat I think 98% of people\nare not doing, and it's only five minutes.\n- You don't even have to do five.\nGive me three.\nIf you really have to\npush it, give me three.\nAnd you can even do\nthis, you can save time.\nYou can do this in the\nshower if you have to.\nSo you're done, you're finished.\nDrink of water, whatever has to be,\nand you're getting in a\nshower, you're getting ready.\nJust give me three minutes in the shower.\nIt's not ideal, but as little as that,\nit can pay huge dividends.\nYou need some sort of internal\nsignal that we're safe.\nLike throttle down here,\nwe're going to move on.\nThat has to happen.\nI could go on and on here,\nbut I think we're making the same point\nkind of over and over again.\nIt's a big deal and do it.\n- Yeah, and you're saving energy.\nI mean, the energy here is neural energy.\nI think fighters do this,\ngood fighters learn to\ndo this between rounds.\nSprinters learn to do this between events.\nI think humans should learn\nhow to do this between any,\nyou know, sort of interval type activity,\nincluding work, social engagement.\n- Yeah, I was going to say-\n- I mean, this is\nsuch a powerful tool.\n- Do this for one minute,\nafter every important,\nwhether it's an individual\nhigh volatile interaction,\nor if it's a, you just did a\nnice 45 minute sprint to work\nand you're deep into it or whatever, fine.\nJust gimme one minute.\nSet your alarm, just one minute,\nand that also will pay dividends.\n- I love it, and as I said,\nit's made a outsize different,\npositive difference on my training,\nbut also activities outside my training.\nWhich is, for me, I'm not\na professional athlete,\nI train for health and 'cause I enjoy it,\nbut when a really hard\nworkout starts to interfere\nwith the ability to do\nthe other things in life,\n- Of course.\n- that's not\na good situation.\nSo this is really terrific.\nThere's a lot more in\neach of those categories\nof strength and hypertrophy,\nbut you've given us a tremendous amount\nof valuable information there.\nMaybe now would be a good\ntime to shift to endurance,\nand of the four types of endurance,\nand maybe you could\nremind us what those are,\nwhat do you think are the two\nthat most people are seeking\nor pursuing in terms of\nhealth and aesthetics, right?\nI realize that we probably\nhave athletes out there\nas well, but when I think\nhealth and aesthetics,\nI think, okay, the ability\nto do sustained endurance,\n30 plus minutes of some ongoing activity,\nhow does one maximize that work?\nWhat are the modifiable variables?\nAnd then maybe you could tell us\nwhat the other major category is,\nthat people ought to have in their kit.\n- Okay.\nSo starting off with exercise choice.\nOne thing, as soon as we cross\ninto the endurance world,\nand this is true for all\nfour of those categories,\nexercise choice needs to be very concerned\nwith eccentric landing, right?\nSo you don't need to avoid it,\nbut you need to recognize it,\nrelative or compare it against\nthose other strength and speed ones.\nThe volume is low on those ones.\nSo if you have some eccentric\nabsorption it's okay.\nBut as we sort of talked\nabout five minutes ago,\nmore eccentric means greater chance\nof muscle damage soreness.\nSo if you take something and\nmagnify it across 30 minutes,\nor even five minutes,\nbut of maximum exertion,\nyou have a recipe for blowing up.\nYou can imagine I haven't run in forever,\nand I've just, I've listened\nto this \"Huberman Lab Podcast\"\nand I'm okay,\nI'm going to get into my\nzone two training, whatever.\nAnd I start jogging, I'm\ngoing to do, you know,\nI remember when I was, I\nused to be able to do 25,\nand you just do a 25 minute jog.\nThe amount of eccentric\nlanding that just occurred\non every single step, because\nyou're never, with running,\neven slow running,\nyou never have two feet on\nthe ground at the same time.\nSo it is a one foot land, one foot land,\nyour entire body mass plus\ngravity onto one leg at a time,\nrepeated now hundreds of times.\nThat eccentric landing is going\nto cause tremendous soreness.\nYour quads are going to go.\nYou're probably going to get\nshin splints, which is what,\nthis isn't, those are entirely\ncaused by eccentric landing,\nand when the tissue is not\nready to tolerate that.\nIf you're not landing correctly,\nthis is when knee pain happens, back pain,\nshoulder, neck pain, 'cause\nof movement compensation.\nSo anytime we start pressing to fatigue,\nlet's be very concerned with there.\nSo my initial recommendation is,\nstart with activities exercise choice-wise\nthat are mostly concentric based.\nSo think about a cycle.\nSo when you're riding on a\nbike, you're pushing the pedal,\nbut you're never landing and absorbing it.\nSo you could go out and\ndo a 45 minute bike ride,\nand you're not going to get that sore\nbecause there's not a\nlot of eccentric load.\nSwimming, similar thing here, right?\nThere's some eccentrics when\nyour hand hits the water,\nbut fairly minimal.\nIt's mostly a push push,\npush, push, push, no load.\nRowing, similar thing.\nMostly concentric.\nPushing a sled is fantastic.\nGoing uphill, running or\neven walking hard uphill,\nall good, 'cause they're\nvery minimal landing\nrelative to like running downhill,\nwhich would be a very,\nvery bad idea to start.\nSo if you're first\njumping into these things,\nprogress your volume for\nendurance very slowly,\nif it involves eccentric landing.\nA really bad strategy\nwould be to jump in and do\nsay circuit training class\nthat involves a bunch of box jumps, right?\nThis is not a good way\nto do your first foray into conditioning.\nYou're going to get incredibly sore\nbecause you're jumping and landing.\nYou're now looking at\nthree to 10 X body weight\nin terms of absorption,\nwith a single land,\neven if you're just jumping.\nSo be careful of that,\nin any of those endurance\nareas of exercise choice.\nSo what to pick.\nPick the one that you are most\ntechnically proficient in,\nbecause you're going to do it a lot.\nIt's going to be a lot of repetitions.\nWhatever one you feel the most joy in.\nIf that's rowing, great.\nIf that's pushing a sled,\nit doesn't really matter.\nYou can do this actually with weights.\nThis is our preferred way, by\nthe way, with our athletes.\nSo we might do a 30 minute circuit\nwhere we do a five minute farmer's carry\nwith a pretty light weight.\nSo you're just going to carry\nsome weights in your hand,\nand you're just going to\nwalk up and down the street\nfor five minutes.\nYou're going to set that down\nand then you're going to do\nsay a three minute plank,\nand then you're going to pick that up\nand you're going to do body weight squats.\nLike slowly and just tempo.\nAnd you're going to do a\nhandful of different exercises,\nso the athletes don't get super bored.\nOr a very simple one,\nif a 30 minute workout,\n10 minutes on a treadmill,\n10 minutes on a bike,\n10 minutes on a rower.\nBut for those of you\nthat are like oh my God,\nI can't do 30 straight\nminutes running, cool,\nbreak it up into three or\nfour different exercises\nthat are all fairly safe.\nSo that's how I would do\nthat long duration piece.\n- Got it.\n- For exercise choice.\n- And then in terms of heart\nrate during that period,\nI mean how much attention\nshould we pay to this?\nThe kind of very broad\nprescriptive I've thrown out\non this podcast a few times,\nbased on my read of the literature,\nis for most people that\nare oriented toward health,\nincluding people that are working on\nsize and strength gains,\nhypertrophy and strength of course,\nthat getting 150 to 180 minutes\nof so-called zone two cardio,\n- Yeah.\n- can just barely have a conversation,\nbut if one were to push any harder,\nyou wouldn't be able\nto, that kind of thing.\nIt's just as a kind of\na generic recommendation\nthat almost everybody should follow,\nin order to just keep their\ncardiovascular system healthy.\nBut I know there's a lot of nuance there,\nand some people would like to\nbe able to run continuously\nfor an hour at speed, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Obviously not sprinting.\nBut what are some of the finer points\non long distance endurance?\nAnd how often should one do it?\n- Okay.\nFrequency, you could\ndo it as daily, right?\n- [Andrew] Even when doing\nstrength and hypertrophy?\n- No question.\n- Well that, I think,\nis an important point\nfor people to hear,\n'cause a lot of people\nthink that they are going to\ngreatly diminish their\nstrength and hypertrophy gains,\nas it's often called, by\ndoing zone two cardio.\n- Zone two, you have almost no ability\nto block your hypertrophy.\nZone two, truly, if it's\nreally within that category,\nif you're talking about\nconversational pace, there is very,\nin fact there is strong reason to think\nthat is not going to influence hypertrophy\nfor the overwhelming majority of people.\n- It might even help it\nby increasing blood flow\nto the various-\n- Absolutely.\n- Does it matter?\nLet's say someone's doing primarily\nstrength and hypertrophy.\nTheir primary goals are\nstrength and hypertrophy.\nAnd then they're going to do,\nthey're going to hit\nthat 150 to 180 minutes\nof zone two cardio per week.\nAssuming they're breaking that up\ninto three or four sessions.\nDoes it matter if they\ndo it in the same workout\nbefore or after?\nDoes that matter?\nI tend to do, just by way\nof example for people,\ncertainly I'm just one example.\nI tend to do resistance training one day,\nthen I'll do zone two cardio the next day,\nI jog 'cause that's the thing I prefer.\nThen I'll do strength hypertrophy\ntraining the next day,\nand then, and jog for my zone two cardio.\nAnd then I take one full day off a week.\nI've never actually\ndone the zone two cardio\non the same day, but were\nI to do it on the same day,\nwould it matter if I\ndid it before or after\nmy strength hypertrophy training?\n- Not really.\n- Okay.\n- You're going to be just fine.\nThe interference effect\nis what this is called.\nSo this is all the way back to 1980,\nBob Hickman's stuff, right,\nand he was actually working\nin a lab with John Holloszy,\nwho's one of the fathers\nof exercise biochemistry.\nAnd sort of the story\ngoes that Hickman came in,\nhe was the strength training guy,\nand Holloszy and almost all of those\ninitial exercise physiologists\nwere conditioning folks, right?\nSo it's almost always\nswimmers and runners.\nAnd that's why a bulk of\nthe exercise physiology,\nhistorically, is shaped in that direction.\nThat's what those scientists\nwere interested in.\nSo Hickman was there in the lab,\nand then how much of this is\nmyth or not who really knows,\nbut so the story goes,\nthat this is sort of\nchipping back and forth,\nand you know how from a PI to a postdoc,\nand kind of that razzing\nworks a little bit.\nAnd eventually he was like you\ngot to start running with us,\nand he was like you got\nto start lifting with me,\nand kind of goes back and forth.\nWell, you know who wins in that equation?\nIt's not the postdoc, right?\nSo it's, the PI gets in and\nsays, Hickman says, okay fine.\nSo he starts running with Holloszy\nand then eventually starts\nto realize I'm getting weak.\nI'm losing strength\nand like, I just can't.\nI think it was his bench press\nspecifically was going down,\nor maybe his squat.\nI can't remember.\nWho knows if it's even real.\nBut point is, so he's going along\nand so eventually that starts to create\na little bit of animosity,\nand he's like actually I don't\nthink this is good for me,\nand then blah, blah, blah.\nAnd so they did what any good\nscientists would do and said,\nwell, let's find out, right?\nAnd so he run a really famous experiment\nwhere he took a group, three groups.\nOne group did a endurance piece, right,\nthe steady state cardio.\nOne group did a strength training piece.\nAnd then the third group did\nboth of those workouts combined.\nNot like a reduction,\nso both volumes stacked\non top of each other.\nAnd the results are fairly predictable.\nIn terms of the endurance group only\nhad the greatest increases in\nVO2 max and endurance markers.\nThe strength training group\nhad the greatest increases\nin muscle hypertrophy.\nBut where the interesting part was,\nand where this whole field\nstarted, was the combined group.\nSo this is concurrent training\nis what it's generally called.\nSo you're doing concurrent things.\nAnd typically that means\nhypertrophy and strength\nstacked on top of some\nsteady state endurance.\n- In the same timeframe.\n- Same workout.\n- Same two hour block.\n- [Andy] Or same like week.\nIt doesn't really, it can be,\n- Got it.\n- kind of all these.\nWell, the concurrent group\nsaw the same improvements\nin VO2 max as the endurance group.\nAnd he is like, well, okay.\nSo the strength training\ndid not compromise the\nendurance adaptations.\nHowever, they saw much lower\nincreases in strength than hypertrophy.\nAnd so it was, the conclusion was,\nthe addition of endurance work\ncompromised muscle growth\nand strength development.\nHowever, the addition of strength training\nto your endurance work\nwill not compromise your endurance gains.\nNow that second piece has been shown\ncountless more times, right?\nSo if you're an endurance athlete,\nadding strength training\nis almost always going to\nbe massively beneficial.\nVery little chance of detriment.\nThis is why every endurance athlete\nis going to have some sort of\nstrength and power component\nto their training.\nThe controversy though came\nin the interference effect.\nSo how much endurance training\nreally blocks muscular development.\nAnd for years, myself included,\nwas we preached hard.\nDon't do these two\nthings at the same time.\nMy friend, my colleague, Kevin Murach\nhas a really nice review\narticle with Jimmy Bagley.\nThose two guys put this thing\nout, you can go read that,\nwhere they cover all these things,\nand they've got some\nnice figures in there.\nBut the general answer here is\ninterference effect is sort of real,\nbut it's probably greatly overblown.\nIt matters, so are you\ntalking about a 20 minute jog\nat conversation pace?\nThat's probably doing very little.\nWith the assumption that\nare you doing an eccentric-based\nexercise like running?\nWell, then you're going to have\nmore of an interference\neffect than cycling.\nThat makes a ton of sense,\nif you think about it, right?\nWhat's your total energy intake?\nIf you're eating sufficient calories,\nyou can still be in an anabolic state.\nIf the addition of extra\nenergy expenditure,\nit's all it really is, the cardio,\nput you in a negative energy state,\nit's going to become very\ndifficult to go through anabolism.\nSo those things matter.\nIf you're talking about\ndoing like running a few laps\naround the track as a warmup,\nlike that's not interference effect.\nWhat we're really talking about\nis a big volume performed consistently.\nNow after Hickman came out\nwith this paper in 1980,\npeople followed it up in the\n'90s and 2000s with mechanism.\nAnd we started to look and see,\nand we started to see, hey,\nthere's this cell-signaling pathway\nthat goes down called mTOR,\nand that's what leads to muscle growth.\nAnd then on the other\nside of that equation,\nthere's a thing called AMPK,\nwhich is more associated with\nmitochondrial biogenesis and endurance.\nAnd there's this little\nmolecule in between at the time,\nmost people would point to TSC2.\nWell, turns out AMPK activation is fine.\nIf you activate mTOR,\nhas no bearing on AMPK,\nbut if you activate AMPK,\nit's going to activate\nTSC2, which inhibit mTOR.\nAnd so it was like we had\npractical outcome, i.e. Hickman.\nYou're going to get weaker.\nNow we had mechanism.\nSo that story became very, very strong\nthat this interference effect,\nand this is how science\nshould work, right.\nWhen you see mechanism match up\nwith practical human outcome.\nIt's a strong-\n- That's what you want.\nYeah.\n- It was still wrong though.\nIt just took more science, right?\nAnd this is why we always\nhave to give science\na bit of time,\nand you have to be\nwilling to follow, right.\nAnd again, even me in the field\nwho has a practitioner\nbackground and science,\nI felt very strongly,\nthis is a big problem.\nIt just didn't turn out to be the case.\nEnough studies came out\nwhere I'm like, okay,\nit's probably not that big a deal.\nUnless the movement is\nheavily eccentric-based,\nthe volume is very high.\nYou're trying to maximize muscle growth,\nand energy's not controlled.\nIf that's not all the case,\ninterference effect is\nprobably not something\nmost people should worry about.\nEspecially when you compare that\nagainst the well-roundedness\nthat you need for total\nphysiological health.\nProbably not a big deal.\n- Very reassuring for me to hear,\nbecause I do enjoy lifting weights\nand I really enjoy running.\nAnd I love running outside.\nI believe I used to experience\nthe interference effect\nwhen I used to do a very\nlong run on Sundays.\nI would just go out for two\nhours or something like that.\nI don't know that I ate\nenough, or who knows.\nI always feel like I eat enough or more.\nI love to eat.\nBut that long Sunday run\nalways made it hard for me\nto make progressive gains in strength\nand hypertrophy in the gym.\nWhereas when I cut that to 30 minutes,\nthree or four times a week,\nI don't see any\ninterference effect at all.\n- Probably very real.\n- And I haven't trained\nspecifically for endurance\nin a very long time, so I don't,\nI haven't experienced the\nnon-interference effect,\nwhich as you said before,\nmost, if not all endurance\nathletes probably are,\nor at least should be doing\nsome sort of strength work,\njust to keep the undercarriage\nstrong as I think-\n- Yeah, there's a bunch\nof reasons, but yeah.\n- So what are some protocols\nthat people could explore\nfor continuous endurance training?\nI mean, I've thrown out this\n150 to 180 minute zone two cardio,\nbut that's really the kind\nof kindergarten of endurance.\n- Yeah.\n- And there, I'm probably being generous.\nIt's probably the nursery\nschool of endurance\nthat everyone should do.\nWhat sorts of other protocols,\nI realize that can be very goal-directed,\nbut is it unreasonable, for instance,\nfor somebody to do four hours of\ncontinuous endurance training\nwith intervals in there as well,\nto get it kind of all around heart health\nand the ability to go long distances?\n- Yeah, I'll answer this two ways.\nThe very first one.\nTo tackle the long duration endurance is,\nhow I refer to it.\nYou asked earlier about heart rate zones.\nTo me, that's almost totally irrelevant.\nIt doesn't matter, right?\nIf you're moving, you're moving.\nThat's the functional piece here.\nIf you want to push it and go\nat a non-conversational pace,\nthat has tremendous health benefits.\nIf you want to do it a\nlittle bit slower, fine.\nIf you're at the pace where\nyou can have a conversation\nto me, I don't even\ncount that as exercise.\nThat's not a pejorative, by the way.\nThat is just general physical movement.\nAnd it is extraordinarily\nclear, you need a lot of that.\nYou need a lot more of that than we get.\nYou can do this in a\ncouple of efficient ways.\nJust taking your phone calls moving.\nIf you've got a 30 minute call every day,\nor most days of the week, and\nyou can do that while moving,\nyou've checked not that whole box,\nbut a pretty good chunk of it.\n- And that could even be done inside,\n- 100%.\n- if you're\npacing back and forth.\nI'm a big pacer.\n- The, yeah, me too.\nLike you probably saw me, like\nI'm going to walk up and down\nall over the place.\nMost of the time, when\nI'm in my office working,\nlike I'm shadow boxing,\nlike I'm doing air squats,\nnot even intentionally, I'm just like.\n- Do you have one of those\ntreadmills under the desk?\n- I don't.\nBut like every lab I ever\ncame through, somebody did.\n- We did an episode on\nworkspace optimization,\nand the data on those treadmills\nare pretty interesting.\nThey definitely increase alertness,\nwhich for obvious reasons,\neven a little bit of\nmovement is going to generate\n- No doubt.\n- a little bit of adrenaline.\nSo pacing around, moving,\ntaking calls moving,\ngetting walks when you can.\nAnd then in terms of building endurance,\nlet's say somebody wants to quote unquote,\nget into better shape.\n- Yeah.\n- They already, may or\nmay not already have\nsome size and strength\nthat they're happy with.\nAnd they just want to get, they\nwant to improve their health.\n- Yeah.\nSo I can-\n- When does that 150,\n180 thing tick over into\na different protocol?\n- Yeah, okay, so I think\nthe way that I can outline\na weekly schedule, just as\na conceptual model here.\nThat long duration stuff\nis not even counting,\nas I mentioned, right?\nIt's just a, this is what you need to do\nas a human, moving forward.\nWe haven't improved.\nIf you're extremely unfit,\nyou may see some changes in\ncardiovascular health there,\nbut for the most part,\nthis is just knocking out the\ngeneral physical practice,\nyou need to be higher functioning.\nSo whatever that time domain\nis, I don't really care.\nIt's not a huge concern of mine.\nWhat I think you need\nto hit are these nodes.\nYou need to do something once a week,\nthat gets you to a maximum heart rate.\nNow I don't have to\nliterally mean max but close.\n- So this means really sucking for air.\n- Really, like as high\nas you can possibly get.\nYou can wear a heart\nrate monitor if you want.\nBut maximum heart rate,\nthe rough equation we say\nis 220 minus your age.\nSo if you're 40 years old,\nyour maximum heart rate is probably about\n180 beats per minute.\nNow I can tell you flat out right now,\nmy max heart rate is close to 210,\nwhich means I'm 10-years-old.\nSo take that number with a grain of salt.\nI have had a bunch of\nprofessional athletes\nwho are in their 20s, and\ntheir max heart rate's 175.\nAnd they are in way\nbetter shape than I am.\nSo maximum heart rate\nis not a good proxy for physical fitness.\nIt's a rough number.\nAn easy way to do it is if\nyou have a heart rate monitor\nor anything like that,\ndo the hardest workout\nyou can possibly do,\nsee what the highest number you get is,\nand assume that's close.\nIf you want to just start\nat 220 minus your age,\nthat's fine too.\nDo something though where\nyou're like, yep, this is death.\nLike this is really, really challenging.\n- For how long?\n- However long that takes you.\nThat can be a 30 second go on an Airdyne\nor Air Assault bike.\nThat could be a, do one of those things\nwhere you kind of like sprint,\nrun as hard as you can during\nthe straightaway on a track,\nand then walk the corners.\nKind of an old classic,\nwhen you and I were\nkids, interval training.\n- They don't do that anymore.\n- I guess, I don't know, I don't\nhear anybody talk about it.\n- In PE class we had to change,\nand if you didn't bring running shoes,\nyou had to do it barefoot.\n- Oh, I love it!\nI love your teacher.\n- Yeah, it wasn't a, our\nfootball, basketball,\nbaseball teams weren't that good,\nbut anything like running cross country,\njust 'cause of where I grew up.\n- Oh yeah.\n- We had brutal coaches.\nSo yeah, they'd make\nall kids do these runs.\n- Yeah, so it can be in\nthe 30 probably seconds\nat a minimum.\nIt's hard to get you to\na true heart rate max\nin shorter than 30 seconds.\nYou can get to total\nsuck in under 20 seconds,\nbut getting to a true heart rate max\nis probably going to take\nmore than 30 seconds.\nSo it doesn't really\nmatter what you want to do.\nIt can be, again, a sprint uphill.\nIt could be, we were talking,\nit could be burpees to death.\nYou know like, whatever\nyou want to do, just-\n- Although those have an\neccentric component, right?\n- Yeah, they do.\nNo question about it.\nBut if you did-\n- Not to actual death, by the way.\n- If you just did I'm going\nto do as many burpees as I can\nfor 90 seconds,\nit probably won't take\nyou much longer than that\nto get close to\nmax workout.\n- And is that\nthe whole workout?\n- [Andy] Could be.\n- So once a week, get to max heart rate.\n- Touch it.\n- I love it.\n- Touch it.\nIt's not the best, but it'll work.\n- And what are the specific\nbenefits that that provides?\n- Okay, so earlier in our chat,\nwe outlined the rule of specificity.\nSpecific adaptation to impose to man.\nIf you're never getting\nto that high of a pace,\nyou're never, it would be\nlike trying to get stronger,\nbut only going to 60%\nSo every cardiovascular\nadaptation that occurs\nwith cardiovascular training,\nis just simply going to get\nto the top end by doing this.\nSo if you just start at the heart itself.\nStroke volume increases.\nSo this is the amount of blood\nthat's kicked out per contraction.\nCardiac output.\nResting heart rate.\nIf you go to the endothelial function,\nyou're talking about nitric oxide release.\nEndothelial health in general.\nCapillary, mitochondria, all the way down.\nLike you just walk\nthrough the whole system.\nPulmonary exchange to the lungs.\nAll of those are going to benefit\nby being challenged to their maximum.\n- They also teach you\nwhere your vomit reflex is.\n- Yeah, there you go.\nRight.\n- Let's hope not.\n- Stress is what causes adaptation, right?\nSo if you push your, okay,\nhere's the difference.\nIf you did 25 minutes of steady state,\nyou're not challenging the same thing\nas what we just talked about.\nThe way that I explain this is\nif you understand the point\nof physiological failure,\nthen you understand the\nplace of adaptation.\nThat's it.\nSo if you and I both go run on a,\nwe both did a VO2 max test.\nSo a classic VO2 max test is going to take\neight to 12 minutes,\nand it's going to look\nsomething like this.\nWe're going to get on a\ntreadmill, and we're going to run.\nAnd every minute\nI'm going to just slightly\nincrease that treadmill,\neither the speed or the grade.\nMost of the time, it's the speed, right?\nSo we get to a high grade,\nsay 10% grade or something,\nand then we go five miles\nper hour, 5.2, 5.4, 5.,\nand we just go until\nyou can't go any longer.\nNow let's say you and I did that,\nand we had the same exact timeframe,\nand so we both went eight minutes.\nThe time that you last\nis not the thing that\nwe care about, right?\nIt's the volume of oxygen\nthat you breathe out\nis what determines it.\nSo let's say we had the same time domain\nand we had the same VO2 max.\nLet's say they were both\n50 milliliters per kilogram per minute,\nwhich is like a okay number,\nbut that's nothing to be\nextremely proud about.\nJust because we have the same number\ndoes not mean we have the same point\nof physiological failure.\nAnd this matters because\nit's going to answer the\nwhat do I do about it\nthen question, right?\nSo if you got off and I started asking you\na series of questions, and you're like,\nand I basically said why'd you quit?\nWhy did you jump off the\ntreadmill, why'd you stop?\nAnd you were like my chest,\nlike I couldn't catch my breath.\nI thought my heart was going to explode.\nOkay, great.\nIf you ask me and I said\nmy legs were on fire,\nlike I was breathing hard but\nI couldn't take another step,\nthis is a very rough\nindicator of different places\nof physiological disruption.\nNow what I've seen a lot with\nmy professional athletes,\nespecially like fighters.\nThey're going to generally\nfail on their legs,\nbecause they don't often do\na lot of strength training\nin their legs.\nThey don't do a lot of leg work.\nThey're fighting on their\nback, literally, a lot,\nor on top, or on their knees.\nSo their legs tend to\ngive out before there.\nSomeone who fails in the\ncardiovascular system,\nlike say you did a lot of leg training,\ntypically like an endurance athlete who's,\nthat's not going to be their issue.\nIt's just going to be they're\ngoing to reach a heart rate\nand ventilation threshold that\nthey can no longer handle.\nIf I put you on the exact\nsame training protocols,\nit's not going to be as effective\nbecause you're going to\nalways fail at your legs\nand they're going to always fail\nat their cardiovascular system.\nI need to flip that, right?\nI need to put you in a position\nto where you can reach a true heart rate\nor ventilation challenge,\nwhile your legs are\nstill hanging in there.\nOr the opposite.\nSo the training protocol is\nbased on that point of failure.\nThe adaptation is in the same thing.\nSo if you are failing\nbecause of your legs,\nthen you might see a greater\nincrease in capillarization\nin your legs,\nrelative to somebody else who's failing in\ntheir cardiovascular system.\nThey may see a greater change in something\non that side of the equation.\nSo it matters how you're\nfailing, at all times.\n- What I love about this is that it's,\nit sounds like it's like a thermometer\nfor where one is weak and needs work,\nbut also provides a stimulus\nto improve the very thing that you need.\n- That's the trick, right?\n- That you need support in.\nSo to just get real brass tacks about it,\nit would be once a week.\n- Okay, yeah.\n- 90 seconds near maximum heart rate.\n- I'll make it easier.\n- Could I do more?\nCould I, you know?\n- Oh yeah.\n- Could I do five or six\nof those 90 second bouts?\n- No question.\nYou can do, as long as you\ntouch that max heart rate,\nI'm good, right?\nIdeal world, probably four to eight.\n- In that single session.\n- Ideal.\n- Okay.\n- Right.\nIf that takes you 20 seconds\nor 90 seconds, it's fine.\nIf you want to do 30 on, 30 off.\nYou want to do 20 on 40 off, 40 on 20 off,\nthose numbers don't matter.\n- And is there an\ninterference effect of this\non the other sorts of training\nthat we've talked about?\n- It actually tends to be complementary.\nThe evidence available suggests that\nthis high interval stuff is\nmore likely to be complementary\nto hypertrophy training,\nprobably because of lactate,\nand some other cool things,\nwhich are very beneficial molecules\nthat people don't understand.\nThey think it's bad,\nit's actually a hugely beneficial thing.\nIt can be interference.\nIt can provide an interference\nif calories are not accounted for,\nif rest is not accounted\nfor, and other things.\nBut in general, it's probably okay.\nI wouldn't add it to your\nequation if you don't need it,\nfor maximizing hypertrophy.\nBut for the person who wants to just get\nwell rounded physiology,\nyeah I wouldn't hesitate to do these,\neven in the same session\nor different sessions.\n- Terrific.\nAnd if that's done once a week,\nand the 150 to 180 minutes or\nso of zone two cardio is done,\nyou know, in the rest of the week,\nperson's doing their strength\nand hypertrophy training\nwe would hope, what other\nsorts of endurance practices\ncould one incorporate.\nYou mentioned muscular\nendurance, like the ability,\nwould like a wall sit or\nthe ability to do a plank.\nIs that something, is\nthat useful for anything?\n- Yes.\n- Be doing planks and wall sitting?\n- No no, it's extraordinarily useful.\nLet's hold on muscular endurance.\nI want to finish one\nmore thing on this side.\nSo if we're building\nthis week of endurance,\nonce a week hit that number,\nif you can do repeated bouts,\nwe talked four to eight, that's fantastic.\nIf you can't manage the\nmental energy every week,\ndo it every other week.\nIt's still very good, right?\n'Cause I get it.\nLike I'm a working person too,\nand sometimes you're just like, I cannot.\nThose workouts feel incredible\nafterwards, but man,\nthey are daunting.\nIf you love this stuff, you\ncould do it four times a week.\nIf you hate it though,\nit's not realistic to think\nyou're going to be able to knock this out.\nYou're going to end up doing 70, 80%,\nwhich is not going to get you the benefit.\nSo just don't do it.\n- You really have to hit that ceiling.\n- [Andy] You've got to get up there.\nClose.\n- Have someone chase,\nI always say, you know,\nwhen doing this kind of work,\nin my mind I'm thinking that\nI'm basically being chased by somebody\nwith a syringe full of poison.\n- Yep.\n- And while there are other\nways out of the situation,\nand for the benefit of\nwhat we're talking about,\nthe one I'm referring to is to just run.\n- Yep.\n- Yeah.\n- My motivation is typically,\nif you just get this done,\nwe're done in a couple of minutes.\nJust get it done.\nLike don't go here if\nyou're not going to do it,\nbut when you show up, check in,\nand it's over really quickly.\n- Breathing down regulation afterwards.\n- Hundred percent.\nYou have to, right.\nIt's a huge key.\nSo if you absolutely can't do\nit, do it every other week.\nThat's twice a month.\nGive me twice a month.\nCan be done on the road,\ncan be done in 20 minutes.\nLike do a really good thorough warmup.\nDon't just jump into those,\nby the way, right away.\nIt's not going to be as beneficial.\nReally nice, good sweat broke.\nA really good warmup.\nAnd then give me four minutes of hard work\nand we're done, right?\nGet out of there.\nIf you want to use like a\nbath or hot thermal stress\nto kind of like aid in\nthat warmup process, fine.\nGet in the sauna, get in a\nhot bath, get really hot,\nget up there, warm up, knock it out.\nWhole thing is 20 minutes,\nplus five minutes breathing.\nYou're out of there.\n- I'm going to start doing this.\n- It's so better, you\ngot a bike right there.\n- Yeah, I've got all,\nevery room in this studio\nhas a different piece\nof equipment, it seems.\n- So, I want that once a week,\nrealistically every\nother week if I have to.\nI want that physical activity piece,\ncall it whatever you\nwant, long duration thing.\nIdeally you'll do as much of\nthat through your nose only.\nYou're not going to be able\nto do the interval stuff\nat nose only.\nDon't even try.\nBut if you can go that\nwhole 30 minute time,\nor 20 or 40 minutes or\nwhatever it's going to be,\nthat's actually a good\nway to regulate intensity.\nSo go as hard as you can,\nwhile still being able to\nbreathe through your nose only.\nIf you have to open up your\nmouth a little bit, fine,\nbut try to stay there.\nWhat you'll see is very quickly,\nyou'll be able to\nincrease your work output\nwhile just breathing through your nose,\nwhich has a bunch of\nother beyond benefits.\nThe other piece I want is\nthis middle ground, which is,\ncan you sustain hard work for eight to 12,\nmaybe as little as four minutes?\nI'll give you four to 12 minutes.\nThis doesn't have to be quite\nas high as the first one.\nYou don't have to get to a heart end max,\nbut can you get somewhere\nin the 80% range,\nand can you hold that for four minutes?\nMaybe gimme two minutes,\ntwo minutes of rest,\nand do that twice.\nSomething like that.\nIdeal situation is what\na runner would do is like\nwhat we'll call mile repeats,\n'cause they're running\nfour or five minute miles.\nWhatever time it takes them to finish,\nthey're going to rest that.\nSo it's a one-to-one work to rest ratio.\nSo a five minute mile, rest\nfive minutes, and go again.\nThat's probably pretty\nunrealistic for a lot of folks.\n- Well the five minute part\nis unrealistic for most folks.\nFor me it would be eight\nminutes, eight minutes.\n- Fine.\n- [Andrew] Probably\nsomething like that now.\n- Well in your particular\ncase, just do the 800 meter.\nSo do 800 meters.\nDo something that takes\ntwo to six minutes of work.\nIt is a lower intensity\nthan the max stuff,\nbut is a much higher workload.\nThat is probably going to give you,\nyou might even argue the\nmost cardiovascular benefit,\nbecause it is sustained work output.\nAnd that's very critical.\nThe downside of kind of like\nthat conversational pace.\nIt's physical activity, it's\nmovement, it's blood flow,\nit's lymphatic drainage,\nit's not very cardiovascularly\nchallenging though.\nYou're just not going\nto get an optimal health\nfrom just walking actively.\n- So two to six minutes of-\n- Hard work.\n- of hard work,\nwith then an equivalent\namount of rest in between,\nand then repeat how many times.\n- Once, if you have to.\nIf it needs to be one rep,\nif it needs to be a six minute thing,\nand then down regulate breathe.\nTwice, if you can do that,\nsix times, eight times,\nlike whatever you can really do.\nAnd you can just take that\nas long of the training\nsession as you want, or short.\nExercise choice could\nbe whatever you want.\nSo again, you can do sled pushes,\nor it could be a kettlebell circuit,\nor any combination of\nthings where you're just,\nyou're working and you're\nnot giving yourself a break.\nYou have got to be able to hold on\nat a very high waste\nproduct production level,\nas well as a high demand for\nenergy, and then bring it down.\n- And breathing during\nthis two to six minutes\nof hard output is mainly through the nose,\nor combination nose and mouth,\nor is that getting too technical?\n- Well, it's probably, like I like it,\nbut you tell me if it's too technical.\nYou're going to try to maintain\nnasal only as much as you can,\nbut you're going to lose it at some point.\nYou can go through their,\nBrian and Rob's gear system,\nand learn more, and\nthen you can kind of see\nwhat gear to be in,\nif you have to go nose in mouth\nout, or something like that.\nBut I don't really care too\nmuch, honestly, in that range.\nI'm getting most of my\nnasal only stuff at night,\nand training and everything.\nSo if you have to open\nup the throttle there\nto get the work done, that's okay.\nOh, then we'll actually go to\nyour, answer your question,\nwhich was muscular endurance.\nLet's go back to that piece.\nMuscular endurance is incredibly important\nfor general maintenance of joint health.\nIn other words, you have got,\nform follows function, right?\nThat's a very classic\nscience-y physiology saying,\nmeaning you've got a couple\nof different, there's a bunch,\nbut to make it easy, two\ndifferent types of muscle fibers,\nfast twitch and slow twitch.\nFast twitch fibers tend to be,\nbut they're not always, bigger.\nThey contract with a higher velocity,\nthat's why they are called fast twitch.\nBut they tend to be more\nglycolytic and less fatigable.\nSlow twitch tend to be\nsmaller, though not always.\nThey are more packed with mitochondria,\nthey are generally better\nat burning fat as fuel,\nbut contract at lower velocity.\nWell we have these two types\nso that we can regulate function more.\nYou have some muscle groups\nthat were going, oh, sorry,\nlet me go back up a quick second.\nEach individual muscle in a human body\nhas a combination of some amount of fast\nand some amount of slow.\nThat percentage of fast versus slow\ndiffers from muscle to muscle.\nSo it also differs from person to person.\nEasy example is your calf muscle.\nThere's three, but there's two\nprimary muscles in your calf.\nOne's called the soleus\nand one's the gastroc.\nThe gastroc is the one\nwhere if you take your toe\nand point it towards\nyour face, and then flex,\nthat's the one that pops out\non the medial side, the inside.\nThe soleus is what we call\nan anti-gravity muscle.\nAnd it is generally about\n80% to even 90% slow twitch.\nAnd that's because it's supposed\nto be contracted lightly,\nall time though.\nIt's supposed to be on permanently.\nIt's meant to keep, we\ncall it anti-gravity,\n'cause it's meant to keep\nyou erect, up and moving.\nYour spinal erectors\nare supposed to do this,\nvarious muscles for postural\nare generally slow twitch muscles.\nSo they're supposed to be on\nat all times, not produce fast,\nnot produce force, but don't get tired.\nThe gastroc is the opposite.\nIt's not activated very often,\nbut when it's activated,\nit's meant for extreme propulsion.\nSo this gives us the ability\nto reach up and scratch our eyeball,\nand also punch somebody, right?\nWe have to be able to\nregulate force output,\nwhich is going back to Henneman right?\nControlling what we\nuse, what we don't use,\nwhile also not wasting energy,\nwhich is the downside of activating\na big threshold motor neuron\nis it requires a ton of energy.\nSo a more efficient mode of energy,\nbut the total amount\nis really, really high.\nSo muscular endurance\nis going to help those\nslow twitch muscle fibers\nand slow twitch predominant muscles\nmaintain their working job.\nSo if you lose your\nmuscular endurance ability\nin your spinal erectors or your calf,\nyou're going to start\nslumping into bad positions.\nYou're going to be getting,\nputting joints in a movement pattern\nthat they're not going to\nbe the most happy with.\nSo it's more than about then\nbeing able to just maintain\na two minute wall squat.\nIt's about maintaining joint integrity,\nand allowing that\nmusculature to not fatigue\nwhen you ask it to do heavy and fast.\nSo what I mean by that is,\nyou've got a whole combination\nof muscles in your shoulder,\nand we will generally call these like\nthe rotator cuff muscles.\nWell, let's imagine those\nslow twitch postural muscles\nget fatigued, and they start\nto lose contractile tension.\nAnd then you go to do\nsomething heavy or fast,\nor in an emergency situation.\nThose are already pretty fatigued.\nYou're going to rely more upon\nthe fast twitch muscle fibers,\nwhich are there less\nfor postural integrity.\nYou're likely to get out of position.\nAnd this is a whole recipe of like, God,\nwhy is my shoulder just hurting?\nGod, my back.\nThat's very often a case\nof the slow twitch fibers\nand the slow twitch muscle\ngroups losing muscular endurance.\nSo you need to build that back up,\nso that they can control and\nhold the joint in the position,\nso the fast twitch fibers\ncan then contract with force.\n- I'm hoping that what\nI'm going to say next\nmeets what you said accurately.\nMy experience is that getting\ninjured lifting weights,\nor even doing house work or yard work,\nalmost always happens when\nI'm not paying attention,\nfatigued, that's kind of obvious,\nbut also getting in position\nto initiate a movement.\nSetting down a weight or\nlifting weights off the rack,\nor picking up dumbbells.\nThat's almost always\nwhen I seem to activate\nthis lower back thing that happens\nevery six or eight months.\nAnd what you're saying,\nif I understand correctly,\nis that this muscular endurance\nfrom wall sits or planks,\nor things of that sort,\nmaybe you could give us a\nfew other examples of these,\ncan help us because they\nactually prepare the system\nto do what we normally think of\nas the more intense work.\nSo it's really the, it\nsounds like it's really\nthe architecture of the body,\nincludes nerves and muscles\nand everything else of course,\nthat lets the limbs and other\nkind of action end of the body\ndo its best work.\nIs that a good way-\n- Yeah, let it express\nits own power and force.\nYep.\nWe've actually landed\non one of my final laws\nof strength and conditioning,\nwhich is, similar to what\nI said earlier, right?\nSo I said, exercises do\nnot determine adaptations.\nApplication determines adaptation.\nThis one sounds similar,\nbut it's quite different.\nThere are no good or bad exercises.\nThere's only good or bad application.\nHere's a great example of that, right?\nSo you do not get hurt dead-lifting\nbecause deadlifts are dangerous.\nYou only get hurt dead-lifting\nbecause you either got in a bad position.\nYou got in a bad position\nbecause you either\nstarted in a bad position,\nwhich is one of the things you just said,\nor you ended up in a bad position.\nYou did too much volume.\nYou did too much intensity.\nOr you did too much complexity.\nThose last three things all hurt you\nbecause they result in the first one,\nwhich is out of position.\nOr another way to think about this is\nif it's not a visible change in position,\nis stress got put into\na part of the system\nthat should not absorb that much stress.\nSo you did too much of it.\nYou did it too heavy.\nYou got fatigued.\nAnd so you broke position.\nYou got too heavy, so you broke position.\nYou made the exercise too complex,\nyou put too many moving parts in it,\nyou put too many joints in it,\nand you got out of position.\nYou did that too many times, over time.\nNow we've led to either\nan acute injury, bam,\nback pops and you fall on the floor.\nOr just like, man, this\nthing is hurting over time.\nAll these are result of the same thing.\nSo you cannot ever blame the exercise\nfor causing the problem.\nIt's always either the user or the coach.\nYou programmed way too much here,\nand I can't handle that position.\nOr you yourself went into it too much.\nSo if you're getting these little tweaks\nand problems going on,\nyou've made an error\nin one of those things.\nSo simply back off.\nReduce the complexity, right?\nGive yourself more\nstability, less moving parts.\nDo less volume.\nDo less intensity.\nIn fact, if you look at the people\nfrom the physical therapy world,\nin terms of the pain literature,\nit's very clear that\njust stopping a movement\nis very rarely going to work.\nWhat you want to do is\nback off all the way down\nto just below that threshold\nof that's what aggravates it,\nand you want to train right there.\nThat's going to allow\nyou to do two things.\nNumber one, tissue tolerance.\nAnd then number two, desensitization.\nA lot of pain stuff,\nand you can probably speak\na lot about this, is,\nespecially with things like low back pain,\nis there's not necessarily\noften much damage there.\nIt's a lot of hypersensitization\nof just pain signal, pain signal.\nOmitting the movement entirely\ndoes not get that signal to go away.\nYou need to train just below\nthat signal and desensitize it.\nSo you want to make sure that\nthe muscular endurance allows you,\nyou're just putting volume right below\nwhere you start to get a tweak.\nAnd it is beautifully effective for that.\n- Yeah, I've experienced this\nright side lower back pain\nfor years, sometimes\nshooting down the hip.\nThe two things that\nreally helped were doing\nanterior tib work.\nSo hats off to Knees Over\nToes Guy, Ben Patrick,\nwho has created a lot of\npopularity around tib work.\nBut-\n- Turns out joints, full range of motion,\nyou're in a better spot.\n- Yeah, something about\nstabilizing the stuff\nfrom the knee down helped my back.\nAnd then also some neck work.\nAnd friends of mine are always teasing me\nthat my gym is filled with\nthe most bizarre equipment.\nIt doesn't look like any other gym.\nA lot of it's just\ndesigned to keep me healthy\nand still training, but.\nI love this idea of getting right at the,\nbelow the threshold of pain activation,\nand not simply going\ninto complete non-action,\nor just taking complete rest,\n'cause that actually can be detrimental.\nI'd love to talk about a few items\nthat support training of all kinds,\nand where there's a lot of confusion\nand indeed misconception and mystery.\nAnd just get your take on these.\nAnd I just want to\nacknowledge at the outset\nthat for some of these,\nthere's a lot of science,\nfor some of them there's less science,\nbut there certainly is a lot\nof experience in your camp.\nAnd those categories are\ncold, heat and hydration.\n- Ah!\n- Because obviously whether\nor not you're a runner,\nwhether or not you're strength training,\nif you're a human being,\nyou need to hydrate.\nBut in terms of work output\nand physical work output,\nmaybe even cognitive work output,\nmaybe tackle hydration first,\nThere is what I call,\nand what I think has\nnow come to be known as\nthe Galpin Equation, which you\nreally do deserve credit for.\nBecause I think that people realize\nthat there are a range\nof solutions out there,\nbut there is a really,\na desperate need for\nstraightforward solutions\nthat work for 75% of\npeople 75% of the time.\nSo hydration is key.\nMaybe you could underscore\njust how key it is for us.\nAnd then what is the Galpin\nEquation, as I call it,\nand I think others are\nnow referring to it.\n- Yeah, okay.\nBenefits of hydration slash\nconsequences of mis-hydration.\nSo whether that's dehydration or overload.\nPhysiology has hormetic curves.\nRight, now typically we think about this\nin terms of toxicology.\nSo what this means is at some point\ngiving you a dose of something,\ntestosterone's a very easy example.\nIf you're clinically deficient\nor low in testosterone,\nand I give you a little bit,\nand it brings you back\ninto a normal range,\nyou generally see an improvement\nin health and functionality.\nTaking you though from\nnormal to super high,\ndoesn't always necessarily\nprovide additional benefit.\nIn fact, if you continue to go,\nit's going to provide detriment, right?\nSo everything has this curve.\nAnd then some things\nare hormetic stressors,\nwhich means like a\nsmall, short, fast insult\nis actually beneficial\nbecause then you come back\nbigger, faster, stronger.\nThat's how adaptation works.\nBasic hormesis, okay.\nHydration's the same way.\nSo at the end of the curve\nhere, if you are under-hydrated,\nwe all know you could die, right?\nYou have to have things, in\nfact water is the only thing\nthat is ubiquitous across biologies,\nin terms of every living\nthing has to have it.\nThere's no other vitamin,\nmineral, nutrient\nthat is required among all living things,\nwith the exception of water.\nSo that should give you\na pretty good indication\nof it's [speaking in\nforeign language], right?\nLike you got to have this thing.\nDown here at the bottom,\nif you're dehydrated and I give you more,\nit's beneficial effects.\nHowever, if you are up the top already\nand I continue to give\nyou more water past that,\nnow we run into actual problems,\nand we can get what's called hyponatremia,\nwhich is more common than people realize.\nNitremia being, actually\nnot referring to the water,\nbut the sodium\nconcentration being too low.\nAnd you've probably talked\nabout that at length\nof why that's an issue.\nIf sodium potassium balances\ninside, outside of cell,\ncome off, heart stops, right?\nMuscle contraction ends,\nand all these things.\nSo you don't want to be\nover or under-hydrated.\nSo understanding this rough equation\nI sort of loosely calculated\none day, is helpful for that.\nI think the most context is talking about\nhow much water to drink\nthroughout the day,\nand then how much water\nto drink during exercise.\nSo the very easy answer is\nhalf your body weight in ounces per day,\nis a very loose guideline\nfor total amount of fluid consumption.\nSo if you weigh 200 pounds,\naim for a hundred ounces of water.\nIt's like a very easy number.\nIf you hit that, you're probably, I'd say,\n90% of you are good.\n90% of the time alone.\nIf you then go to exercise,\nyou need to then account for\nthat fluid loss with exercise.\nAnd in general, you want\nto consume 125% to 150%\nof the amount of weight you lost in fluid.\nIn other words, if you worked out\nand you were 200 pounds naked,\nand you went and did your\nworkout, and then you dried off,\nand you weighed yourself again,\nand now you're 198 pounds,\nyou lost two pounds of water.\nThat's 32 ounces.\nYou want to drink back about 125% of that.\nSo instead of drinking 32 ounces,\nI want you to drink 40, 42,\n45, like something like this.\n'Cause one of the reasons why is,\nunless you're drinking\nsomething that is isotonic,\nmeaning the same exact\nconcentration in your blood,\nand that you're in your fluid,\nyou're just going to go\ncloser to that hyponatremia.\nYou're going to get a bunch\nof baroreflextor responses,\nand you're going to actually\nthink you have too much fluid\nand you're going to urinate it out.\n- What if I'm not weighing\nmyself before and after workouts?\nAnd is there a shorthand\nversion of this that,\nafter training for an hour,\nI should drink at least\nX number of ounces.\n- Yeah that-\n- Assuming it's at kind of,\nI'm not sweating super heavily.\n- Yeah.\nIn that particular case,\nyou could probably go something like,\nif everyone in the world did,\nI don't know, 12 to 20 ounces,\nthat's probably like pretty decent.\n- And they're probably doing that, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\nAnd what about electrolytes,\nconsuming salt, potassium, and magnesium?\n- But that thing only works though,\nif you're coming in at optimal hydration.\nAnd this is the problem,\nthis is why you have to,\nyou have to flag this\nstarting with a good total\ndaily amount of water.\nBecause if you're coming\nin and you're like\noh I drank two or three\nglasses of water a day,\nthen you might need to drink\n50 or 60 ounces post-workout,\n'cause you are way behind.\nSo that like oh 12 ounces or so works,\nif you're already generally\nvery well hydrated.\n- And if people are drinking\nfour to six glasses of water a day,\nbut they're also drinking a\nlot of caffeine in any form,\nthen they're going to\nbe excreting more water,\nin most cases, right?\n- Well-\n- because caffeine's\na diuretic.\n- Okay.\nIt kind of is, but it\nkind of isn't either.\nIt's not the diuretic that\nwe used to think about it as.\nIt is still fluid consumption.\nSo it's only a diuretic if it causes you\nto excrete more fluid than\nactually was being intake.\nSo if caffeine intake\nis in a normal range,\nI don't have to worry\nabout the diuretic effects.\nIf someone is drinking\n12 cups of coffee a day,\nwe're going to, or they're taking\ncaffeine pills or something,\nnow the excretion is going\nto out-kick the coverage.\nSo now we're going to\nhave problems, right?\n'Cause there's no fluid\nconsumption with the caffeine pill.\nSo in general, things\nlike tea consumption,\nlike I'm not super worried\nabout those things.\nYou can count those towards\nyour total fluid intake\nif you want.\nSo if you're like, I\ndrink 60 ounces of water\nplus 20 ounces of coffee, and then this,\nlike you're going to add that all up\nand you're going to be totally okay.\nSo natural, you also have problems with\nsynthetic forms of caffeine\nversus natural forms of caffeine.\nNatural forms are pretty okay.\nThey'll be just fine.\n- So coffee, tea, et cetera.\n- Yeah.\nAll that stuff.\n- Pill form\nis where it gets tricky.\n- Always.\nLike always, right.\nSo general, just eat real food and things.\nYou're going to be just fine.\nThe last piece to consider is\nyour diet quality matters.\nBecause the fluid content in\nyour food can vary wildly.\nSo something like a bagel\nmight be five to 10% water,\nor something like a\nwatermelon is 98%, 95%,\nsomething in a huge range.\nEven meat is very high\npercentage of fluid intake.\nLike it's really high.\nEven after you cook it,\nthere's still a lot of fluid in there.\nSo if you're eating a wholefood,\nmostly wholefood-based diet,\nyour endogenous hydration is\nactually pretty high already\njust from your fluid.\nIf you're eating a very\nhighly processed, dehydrated,\nover-salted diet, you're\nway low on hydration,\njust in your food.\nSo you have to factor all these things in,\nin fact, one of the things\nthat happens to us constantly\nwith folks that go from\na like highly processed,\nlow quality diet, to a high quality one,\nis they're just peeing nonstop.\nLike what the hell's going on.\nI'm like, well you\nactually have brought in\n60 additional ounces\nof water in your diet,\nrelative to what you used to have.\nAnd you've gone from 10 grams\nof sodium there to four,\nto two, sometimes one.\nSometimes it gets very low\n'cause you're not like salt,\nare you salting your food?\nNo.\nOkay.\nWell we don't have sodium intake then.\nLike we're way down.\nSo everything that we're\nconsidering is based on that.\nSo let's assume someone's eating\na pretty well balanced diet.\nThey're drinking 16 ounces of\nwater and maybe some caffeine\nin coffee and tea, things like that.\nWe don't exactly know the\noptimal amount of sodium\none should intake.\nIt is very clear, high\nsodium concentrations\nare still associated with a lot\nof negative health outcomes,\nespecially in combination\nwith poor physical activity,\nin combination with low food quality\nand other comorbidities.\nThat's a very bad thing.\nYou need to be very\ncareful about those things.\nIf everything else is okay,\nwe're okay playing with a\nlittle bit of higher salt.\nIn fact, you're probably\ngoing to feel better.\nYou're going to feel\ngenerally pretty good.\nYou just, it needs to be very clear.\nIf you are overweight, highly stressed,\nand you don't have a lot\nof these things ticked off\nand you have known comorbidities,\nyou really need to pay\nattention to salt intake.\nIt can be very nasty.\nSo that being said,\nwhat we're generally going\nto look at in folks is,\nare you at least, can we\ncategorize you as a low sodium\nor high sodium sweater?\nIf so, there's a whole list\nof electrolytes you can look,\nthat are going to have something like\n200 to 400 milligrams per serving.\nAnd there's a whole list of these things.\nIf you're a low sodium sweater,\nI'm probably going to send\nyou after one of those.\nIf you're a high sodium sweater,\nthere's a lot of electrolytes supplements\nthat are closer to six or 800,\neven a whole gram per single serving size.\nSo you want to play with that.\nA very-\n- How do you know\nif you're a low sodium\nor high sodium sweater?\nWe actually have an episode\non salt we put out that,\nor is coming out soon if\nit hasn't come out already,\nwhich is when you look at the\nhazard ratios for salt intake,\nbasically your probability of\nreally bad things happen to you\ngoes way up as you get towards\na lot of sodium intake,\n10, 12 grams per day.\n- Totally.\n- And this is translated to\nteaspoons of salt, et cetera.\nBut also very low sodium\nintake is a problem.\n- No question about it.\n- So it's a,\nit's not a perfect U shape.\nIt's kind of a J shaped curve,\nor a kind of hockey\nstick shape more or less.\nBut how would I know if I'm a low sodium\nor a high sodium sweater?\n- Yeah, so you can get-\n- Would I just kind of lick\nmy sweat or have someone else\ndo it?\n- Well you can.\nFind a super friend who'll\nlick your sweat for you.\nSame how-\n- No willing volunteers that I'm aware of,\nbut would I be able to tell?\n- Yep.\nYou can get sweat testing done.\nActually you have a number of options.\nThe kind of, the original one\nthat most of us used in the\nbackground for many years\nis called Levelen.\nThey'll send you out a little\npatch, you can wear that,\nsend it in the lab,\nand they'll measure it directly\nin the lab and send it back.\nIt's 150 bucks or-\n- Did they bin you into low,\nmedium, and high sodium?\n- They're going to do that, but\nthey're going to give you very,\nthey're going to tell you\nexactly the milligrams.\nAnd they're going to actually tell you\nlike what products and stuff\nthat are exactly matched.\n- Do you do this with\nprofessional athletes?\n- [Andy] We have many times.\nYeah.\n- Interesting.\n- You can do a more\nconsumer grade version.\nGatorade has a patch.\nFor 25 bucks you can get two of them.\nYou can put that patch\non your left forearm\nand download the Gatorade\napp, and you can do a workout,\nmeasure it right there and click it over,\nand they'll tell you exactly,\nnot only high or low,\nbut again, they'll tell you\nthe milligrams of sodium\nthat are in your sweat, and\nthen you can figure out, again,\nkind of high, medium, or low.\n- Interesting.\nI do much better on a\nslightly higher sodium intake.\n- [Andy] Most do.\n- But in my carbohydrate,\nI do eat carbohydrates,\nI'm one of those that\nit is pretty moderate,\nbut I try and eat clean foods.\nSo I'd notice, and I tend to\nbe slightly low blood pressure.\nSo again, to reiterate the warning there\nthat if somebody is pre-hypertension\nor has hypertension or obese,\nyou really do need to be\ncareful with your sodium intake.\nBut many people seem to\nfind that they feel better\nwhen they increase their sodium intake,\nand they're still in that healthy portion\nof the hazard ratio.\n- Most of the athletes,\nI would say in general,\nare going to go higher in salt.\nWhen they come, we're\ngoing to run their stuff\nand we're going to add salt.\nAlmost always.\nVery few times have I gone\now, we need to cut this back.\nOne of the exceptions\nare the ones that come in\nthat eat like 14-year-olds.\nAnd I'm like, okay,\nyou're at 15 milligrams,\nor 15 grams a day, 'cause\nyou're eating nothing but.\n- Garbage.\n- So we're like, we're going to come down,\nyou're going to feel way better.\nAll this bloating and everything\nelse that's going to happen.\nGo down.\nYou can do that, there are actually more,\nthere are biosensors that are coming out\nthat are not available yet,\nbut they're coming very\nsoon in this space,\nthat are going to give you\nreal-time metrics on salt.\nSo you can pay attention to those.\nI haven't seen one and\nused one personally,\nso I don't want to espouse\nabout how good or bad it is,\nbut I know that those are coming\nfrom a handful of companies.\nAn easy way to do is\njust look at, wear a hat,\nor wear some sort of headband or something\nand do your workout.\nTake it off.\nIf you see a just huge white band,\nor if it's completely clear,\nthen that's going to tell you.\nBig white band, you're\nprobably a high salt sweater.\nCompletely clear, very little coming out.\n- That's great, and I can see\nthe posts on Instagram now,\npeople showing their\nsalt band from sweating.\n- Yeah.\n- And obviously salt is so essential\nfor so many physiological functions.\nYou don't want too high or too low,\nbut if you're losing more,\nit makes sense you would\nneed to take in more.\n- Yep.\n- So half of my body weight\nin ounces, as a just\nfoundation of a fluid intake.\nCoffee and tea could be included in that,\nbut that should probably be mostly water\nor things similar to it.\nAnd then during exercise the,\nhow do I want to think about this again?\nLet's say I'm a high salt output,\nthen I'd want to drink maybe\n40 ounces water with or more.\n- Yeah, okay.\nI'll do this easier.\nLet's talk about pre\nand mid and post, right?\nSo what to drink pre,\nif you come in having hit\nthese rules, you're okay.\nAnd pre workout can be as little\nas like five or six ounces.\nBasically a couple sips of water.\nFine.\nIf you come in poorly hydrated,\nthen you maybe need to go more\nlike 12, but here's the deal.\nIf you start off a session in a bad spot,\nyou're not going to catch back up.\nLike you just, you're in trouble.\nLet's say you come and\nyou follow direction.\n500 milligrams salt before,\n500 milligrams after.\nA very easy rule.\nPick whatever source you want,\nthat's a couple of\nsprinkles of table salt.\nIf you want Himalayan, that's\nfine, you don't have to.\nHimalayan's actually a\nfairly low sodium salt,\nso it's not the best for this purposes.\nIf you're a higher salt\nsweater, a little bit more.\nIf you want to go choose an electrolyte,\nof which there are infinite,\nyou can look on the\npacket and it'll tell you,\n250 milligrams per\nserving, or 400, or 600,\nor whatever happens,\nbut around 500, pre 500,\npost is a very general rule.\nAnd then during is, thanks to you,\nmy famous Galpin Equation now,\nthat is all over the world.\nAll I did is I took the\nliterature and I said, okay,\nin general, the research\nshows pretty clearly\ntwo milligrams per kilogram body weight\nover 15 minutes seems to put\nyou in a pretty good spot.\nMost people don't think about\nkilograms or milliliters.\nSo can I just run that\nover, and then turns out\nit's about your body weight\ndivided by 30 in ounces.\nLike that's all you have-\n- Body weight in pounds divided by 30.\n- Yeah, exactly, right.\nSo you weigh 200 pounds, divided by 30,\nand that's the number of ounces.\nYou're going to want to go\nevery 15 or 20 minutes or so.\n- So I'm getting that amount\nevery 15 to 20 minutes\nthroughout the training.\nAnd now in the weight room,\nthat's pretty easy to do.\n'Cause there are rest intervals.\nBut people will need to do\nthis while running or cycling,\nand that can cause a little\nbit of gastric distress,\nif you're not used to it, is that right?\nYou can learn to run with\nsome water in your belly.\n- A hundred percent.\nThe gut is very trainable\nin a lot of directions,\nbut in terms of fluid,\nas well as carbohydrate,\nwhich is another thing that\nis going to get people,\nbut that's yeah, very trainable.\nIt'll be uncomfortable initially,\nbut you'll quickly get into it.\nThe better solution for those\nfolks, just come in hydrated.\nAnd you might not even need any water.\nYou could probably perform just fine.\nSo the ones that don't have\nas much of an opportunity,\nyou really have to emphasize walking in.\nWe have this problem with\nlike professional golfers.\nThey have plenty of time to drink water,\nbut they're so focused on the shot\nand there's a lot of variables coming up,\nonce they hit their shot\nand they're moving on to the next one,\nthey're thinking about,\nI mean, they're going over a\nscorecard of 185 yards away.\nCan I go 184 1/2 yards, can I go 186 yard,\nwhat's the slope of that,\nwhat's the wind up here,\nwhat's the wind up there?\nLike they're just thinking,\nand they just forget,\neven though they have 4 1/2 hours,\nso we have to make sure\nthat they immediately get off the course.\nWe go right into recovery,\nas hard as we possibly can.\nThey wake up the next morning,\nthey're in a good spot,\nwe crush recovery.\nAnd now it's like, hey,\nif you can remember to drink this, great.\nIf not, we're still fine.\nIf it's not a big deal,\nand you have time like in a lifter,\nbecause I deal with that\nproblem with fighters too.\nLike we can only drink so\nmuch in the middle of a fight.\nA couple sips over there.\nBut we can't go mix and.\nTwo mills.\nIt's like, can you get\na couple sips in, yeah,\noh shit, forgot like,\nit's not going to happen.\nSo we have to take more of\nan emphasis before and after.\nSo start your recovery\nprocess immediately,\nand then come in the next\nday, that's your window.\nAnd then whatever you can\nget in during the workout,\nthat's fine too.\nIf you're a higher salt sweater,\ninstead of going 500,\n500, maybe go 750, 750.\nIf you have a longer about of exercise,\nespecially if it's hot or humid,\nthen you might want to consider\nsome salt in the workout as well.\nAnd 300 milligrams during\nthe workout, totally fine.\nIt's enough.\nIf it is a really long\nworkout, and it's really hot,\nand you're going to lose pounds during it,\nyou need a specific strategy.\nIf you're going to lose less than a pound,\nyou don't need to worry about it.\nIt's not going to be enough of a detriment\nfor you to really care.\nSo that's kind of a rough rule.\nNow, if you're 200 plus pounds,\nmaybe that number moves from\none pound to two pounds.\nBut really the number we're looking at\nis 1% of your body weight.\nIf you're losing more than\n1% of your body weight,\nwe need to start caring.\nIf it's less than 1%,\nit's not going to really pay\nthat much of a difference.\n- Okay, so for myself, because\nI don't get super technical,\nI don't wear any devices\nbesides a wristwatch.\n- It's a nice watch too.\n- Thanks.\nYeah I do, very attached to this watch,\nor it's attached to me, I suppose.\nMy body weight in pounds divided by two,\nthat's what I'm going to try\nand get across the entire day\nas a kind of baseline.\nAnd then my body weight-\n- Oh yeah.\n- in pounds divided by 30\nduring the workout,\nevery 15 or 20 minutes,\nthat I'm going to try\nand consume that amount.\nAnd then I definitely do better\nwhen I increase the amount of salt\nthat I'm taking in anywhere from 500 to,\n500 milligrams to a gram of salt,\nseveral times a day, actually.\nBut I'm not eating that often,\nwhich leads me to my\nother question, which is,\nI prefer to train fasted or semi-fasted,\nmeaning first thing in the morning\nor within an hour or two of waking.\nObviously I've been\nfasting while I'm asleep.\nOr having not eaten anything\nfor three or four hours before.\nI just feel lighter and\nlike more energetic.\nIf that works for me, is\nthat okay, or should I try,\nis it better to eat\nsomething before one trains?\n- Personal preference.\nEasy, easy answer there.\n- Great.\n- It depends on of course\nhow hard you trained, what\nthe training was like,\nwhat sport you're involved\nwith, how many total calories,\net cetera, but in general,\npersonal preference\nfor the average person.\n- Yeah, that probably handles 90% of the\nquestions about that.\nCold.\nCold showers, ice baths, and\ncold immersion up to the neck.\nI always preface this by saying\nthere are not a lot of studies.\nThere are some, but not a\nlot of controlled studies\nlooking at cold showers,\n'cause it's harder to\ncontrol the variables\nof where people stand.\nSo I would say if you have access to\na cold immersion of some sort,\nice bath or cold immersion,\ngreat, but if you don't,\ncold showers would be the next best thing.\nThe lore goes that if you do an ice bath\nor cold water immersion\nafter strength or hypertrophy training,\nthat you are short\ncircuiting some of that.\nThe lore also goes that\ncold showers might be okay.\nAnd my interpretation of\nthose data and that discussion\nis that all that is probably true,\nbut I have a hard time\nimagining that the effects\nare so robust that it\ncan completely prevent\nstrength gains and hypertrophy,\nsuch that my stance for myself is\ntry and do the cold exposure training\naway from the strength\nand hypertrophy training.\nBut if you can't do it any other time,\nright afterward probably isn't\ngoing to throw my whole system\nout of whack and prevent the improvements.\nAm I deluding myself?\n- A couple of caveats here.\nNumber one, obviously I have\na personal vested interest in cold.\nI've been around this\nstuff for a long time,\nbeing involved and being\nan advisor for XPT,\nand being in this space a long time,\nI'm a big believer in cold.\nEspecially cold water.\n- Deliberate cold exposure.\n- Hundred percent, right?\nSo that being said, I do\nthink getting into an ice bath\nimmediately after a hypertrophy session\nis getting pretty close to\nyou just shouldn't have done the session.\nIt is detrimental.\n- [Andrew] Good to know.\n- I wouldn't do it, I guess is\nthe most blunt way to put it.\nIf you're like hey,\nlike I'm not super concerned\nwith growing muscle,\nand I want these other\nthings that come with\ncold water immersion, fine.\nIt's not zero, it's not\ntaking you backwards.\nHow much does it cut you down?\nI don't know.\nWe don't know, like that'd\nbe a difficult number\nto come up with.\nIs it 1% reduction?\nNo, it's more than that.\nIs it a hundred?\nNot even close.\nI don't know where it lands though.\nIt's enough though for me to\ngo in general, best practices,\ndon't get in the ice\nimmediately after a workout.\n- How long should I wait?\n- Well, in theory, the best\nanswer we could give you\nwould be four hours,\nbecause of what we talked about\nearlier today of going okay.\nImmediately, you've got\nthe signaling cascade\nthat takes seconds.\nYou've got gene expression\nthat's happening\nin this rough four hour window.\nAfter the genes have gone off\nand now you're just going through\nthe protein synthesis process,\nthe signal's already there\nand it's gone back down to baseline.\nSo then reintroducing,\nor introducing cold here\nis not going to disrupt that signal.\nThat's a very non-scientifically founded\nbecause we don't know,\nat this point at all.\nWhat is very clear though is\nif you get off your workout,\ngo right into the ice,\nit's probably 10% attenuation of growth.\nI don't know, maybe more,\ndepends on the person.\nSome people, if you look\nat the individual data,\nit's pretty bad.\nIt's enough to where it's\nlike that's a really big deal.\nThe benefits of the ice, I don't think now\noutweigh the benefits of\nthe hypertrophy training.\n- What about cold showers?\n- I don't think cold showers\nare going to do much.\nif you've been in both,\nyou know that this is like,\nwe're not playing the same game here.\n- Right, an ice bath or\ntrue cold water immersion\nup to the neck with limbs\nin, for one to five minutes,\nis a completely different\nstimulus than in the cold shower.\n- Especially also compared to\na similar like cryo, right?\nIt is not even the same thing here.\nSo in general, I would say,\ndon't do those cold shower,\nI don't really care.\nCan you work it out so that you\ndon't do them the same time?\nThat would be my hope, right?\nI would actually prefer\nyou do the cold before.\nIf you really had to do it.\n- Certainly will wake you up.\n- Oh yeah.\n- Get that adrenaline burst.\n- No we've played with that\nactually years ago, doing that.\nThere's actually some fun stuff you can do\nwith the endurance piece, with cold stuff.\nBut it's totally not\nfeasible for most people,\n'cause you're getting water everywhere,\nthen you're going to jump on\nyour bike and just get shit,\nand it's just a giant mess.\nIt's fun, but yeah, I\nwould say walk away from it\nif you can.\nThat's actually, that's where\nI stand based on the data.\nBased on my intuition and experience,\nI don't think it's a good thing to do.\nNow having said that,\nthat's mostly concerned\nwith maximizing hypertrophy.\nStrength, it's not as clear.\nThere are some data to show\nwhat actual block strength adaptations,\nbut because of what we\ntalked about earlier,\nthe mechanisms and the\ndrivers are different.\nAnd so I don't think it's as big a concern\nfor strength development,\nthough I would still generally say,\nif you can get away with\nstaying out of the ice\nimmediately after the workout,\nand you can at least wait a few hours,\nthat's the better approach.\nLess concerned with strength,\nmore concerned with hypertrophy,\nin terms of interference effect.\nIf you can do it on off days,\nor before, any other time,\nthat's the place to land.\n- That's generally when I try to do it.\n- Yeah.\n- I was just kind of\nthrowing out an extreme case,\n'cause I get asked that question a lot.\nWhat about the use of ice\nbath or cold water immersion,\nor cold shower after endurance training?\n- Okay, so a couple of\ninteresting things here.\nYou mentioned we don't have\na tremendous amount of data\non cold water immersion overall.\nSo a lot of this is moving.\nThere have been some papers to show\nthat cold water immersion\ncan actually enhance\nmitochondrial biogenesis.\nAnd actually, even for\nendurance stuff it's been shown\nto cause improvement in\nendurance adaptations,\nrelative to not.\nIt's not enough for me\nto be truly confident\nin that statement yet.\nI would like to see that repeated,\nnot that I have a problem with the paper,\nthe methodology that they\nuse in that particular study,\nbut it's just, like this is a weird thing.\nSo I want to see this repeated more often.\nSo I have less concern\nwith doing it immediately\npost-endurance, 'cause\nyou could even argue that\nthere may be some benefit.\nI don't think you need\nto go out of your way\nto try to make sure you get\ninto ice immediately afterwards\nand thinking you're going to\nget some massive adaptation.\nWe use ice a decent amount,\nwhen I can get athletes to do it.\nBut this context is different.\nNumber one, when we're in camp\nand we've got a world\ntitle fight coming up,\nor something else,\nwe've just pitched in a\nmajor league baseball game,\nI am not concerned about hypertrophy.\nI am not even concerned\nwith strength development.\nI am now pushing towards recovery.\nThere's a paradigm that\nI think is important\nwith all of these things to understand,\nwhich is, are you pushing for\noptimization or adaptation?\nWhen you're pushing for adaptation,\nyou don't want to block\nthe signal for adaptation.\nThis means less recovery.\nYou're not going to feel as good.\nAnd you probably should\nbe hedging towards stress.\nWhen you're pushing for\noptimization, it's the opposite.\nSo if I'm in season\nand I had a pitcher\njust throw 125 pitches,\nI'm not trying to cause adaptation.\nI'm trying to recover\nas quickly as possible\nbecause four days from now\nwe got to do this again.\nAnd I got to do this across 162 games.\nYou're going to play five\ndays in a PGA golf tournament,\nand you're going to have\nto do it again every week\nfor a bunch of weeks in a row.\nI need recovery as fast as I possibly can.\nSo if I'm blunting adaptation fine,\nI'm not actually trying to do something,\nI'm trying to optimize.\nIf you spend all of your time\nin one of those two areas,\nyou're going to have problems.\nSo you need to be judicious about thinking\nis this a point in my\nlife, or a training cycle,\nthat I want to cause adaptations?\nOr am I trying to optimize?\nYou spend too much time\nin one of the other ones,\nagain, you're going to have problems.\nSo that's in generally\nhow I will treat the ice\nfor all those adaptations.\n- What about heat?\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- When, and I'll frame\nthis question differently\nbecause I'm sure there\nare a number of ways\nin which heat can short\ncircuit all sorts of things.\nI mean, heat in excess can kill you.\nIt can shut down fertility.\nIt can, in excess, right?\nIt can do all sorts of things,\nbut it can also increase growth hormone,\nincrease vasodilation, improve\none's ability to sweat,\nwhich can be very beneficial\nin a number of contexts.\n- Yep.\n- For the typical, for 75%\nof people, 75% of the time,\nwhen do you think heat is most useful?\nAnd here I'm referring to\ndry sauna or wet sauna.\nI'm not specifically\ntalking about infrared sauna\nbecause the data there are\na little unclear to me.\nAnd I don't even know that,\nmy sense with infrared saunas\nis they don't go hot enough\nfor my particular taste.\n- You and I have a similar taste there.\n- Okay, yeah.\n- If we're not crushing\n200 past I'm not interested.\n- Right, and my sense about\ninfrared sauna is that,\nmaybe I haven't seen the data, is that,\nbut that a lot of people like it\n'cause they like the way they\nlook in the infrared sauna.\nIt feels cool, it feels like\nyou're doing something unusual.\nNow infrared lights are\nbeneficial for other reasons,\nactually for mitochondrial\nhealth and the retinas,\nthe good data, but infrared sauna to me\nit never goes hot enough.\nSo I'm talking about 200 or\nhotter, maybe 180 to 220.\nObviously do what's safe folks,\nand heed all the warnings\nabout pregnant people\nnot going in saunas, et cetera.\n- I assume you're lumping\nin hot water immersion-\n- Hot water immersion,\nso hot baths, hot sauna.\nWhen do you think most\npeople could leverage sauna\nor hot baths to benefit their training\nand fitness and health?\n- Yeah, okay, I have a\nhandful of things to say\nabout this topic.\nOne of 'em is, you never have\na hard time convincing people\nto get hot.\nEveryone feels good.\nLike yeah, get in a hot bath,\nlike, can you take more hot showers?\nSure.\nLike no problem there, right.\nThere are a handful of studies\nthat have looked at this\nimmediately post, and it seems\nto even augment hypertrophy.\n- So after hypertrophy training,\ngetting in the sauna for 20 minutes.\n- Yeah, whatever, whatever it needs to be.\nWe don't have a good titration.\nWhat's the number minutes wise.\nWe don't have a temperature titration.\n- Hot shower would be a second,\nwould be a weak second best.\n- I would say it's a very weak-\n- [Andrew] To the hot bath.\n- I think a hot bath is\nprobably a lot closer\nto what you're looking for.\nIt actually kind of goes back\nto our initial conversations.\nTheoretically, you're just\ngoing to aiding blood flow.\nSo you're going to put more nutrients in,\nmore waste product out, metabolic stress,\nall that stuff is going through.\nSo that's the thought anyways,\nwe're far from knowing,\n- Makes sense.\n- Plausible, right.\nAbsolutely plausible.\nSomething people will do.\nFeels good.\nLet's say, with cold and hot,\nI want to caution you\nagainst a couple of things.\nThis is true across all physiology,\nbut you need to be really\ncareful about moving percentages\nfrom molecular to outcome.\nVery careful.\nSo for example, it's easy to\nsee a paper that says, okay,\nwe put you in a hot bath or something,\nand we saw a growth hormone increase 300%.\nThat is not going to\nresult in 300% increase\nin muscle size, right?\nIn fact, 300% might result\nin absolutely no change\nin a physical size, right?\nAnd the reason I'm saying this is\nbecause there's a lot\nof people in this space\nthat will misapply the mechanisms.\nAnd they'll grossly overestimate\nwhat these things can do\nand what they do do,\nbecause they'll find something like that.\nI mean you know this, you've\ndone enough cellular work too.\nIn the lab, if I see mTOR\ndoubled, I think shit,\nit didn't work.\nI need to see a 10 X\nincrease before I know\nit's even physiologically relevant.\nSo reading that paper, reading\nsomeone's social media post,\nyou're like wow, it increased mTOR 38%.\nI'm like, well, that didn't work.\nAnd you're like, wow, that's huge.\nI'm like, that's not 38%\nincrease in muscle size.\nSo that's a very important\npoint I want to make,\nbecause I'm going to talk about\nthe benefits here in a second.\nBut I don't want people\nto be fooled into thinking\nthat this is some crazy miracle.\nThe same thing with the sauna.\nIn terms of general health outcomes,\nit is clearly a beneficial thing.\nThis is a really good\nidea to get hot a lot.\nIt is not a substitute\nfor exercise though.\nIt's a very important distinction.\nIf the options are nothing\nor sauna, get in the sauna.\nReally, really good idea.\nIf the exchange is though,\nI don't need to work out\nbecause I did the sauna, bad.\nThis is not a winning solution.\n- You and I know some maniacs\nthat actually work out in the sauna.\n- Oh, we do.\nYeah, kind of not far away.\n- I don't necessarily recommend that.\nThat actually would probably\nkill a large number of people.\nBut it can be worked-\n- Yeah, if they die, they die.\n- It can be worked up to.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- Certainly.\n- Yeah.\nSo I want, like every time I\ntalk about that I flag that,\nbecause it's just too easy\nto hear that and go, oh,\nwell I think Dr. Huberman said,\nif I just get in the sauna,\nI don't have to work out.\nLike no, no, those words have never\ncome out of his mouth.\n- He definitely didn't\nsay that.\nAnd I'm definitely not\nworking out in the sauna.\nIf I'm in the sauna, I'm either\nsitting or I'm lying down,\nand I'm trying to make it through.\nI tend to do three 20 minute\nbouts, across the entire week.\nSo I aim for 60 minutes\nper week of heat exposure.\n- I would be lying,\n- Which is not a ton.\n- if I said I've never\nworked out in the sauna.\n- Oh, so you're one of those.\nYeah, people will do air squats,\nthey'll bring the Airdyne bike in there.\nI look at the sauna as kind of\na time to get lazy and sweat.\n- Totally fine.\nGoing back to your original question.\nSo potential the plausible aid,\nwe need to see more research on that\nto really get a, do I need\nto put this in practice.\nI think if you try it, very little harm.\nI struggle to see a downside.\nIf you make sure your\nhydration's on point, right,\n'cause now you got to factor in the fact\nyou just kicked out two or three pounds.\nIf you at 200 plus pounds,\nI assume, or roughly,\nif you're in the sauna for 20 minutes,\nI would imagine you can\ndo two or three pounds.\n- Yeah, I usually, I hover\nsomewhere around like 225.\nAnd I drink a 32 ounce,\nit's water with a electrolyte solution\nthat's pretty high salt afterwards.\nAnd sometimes during.\nAnd sometimes after that, if\nI do it late in the evening,\nI'll go to sleep\nand I'll wake up in\nthe middle of the night\njust feeling so parched.\nIt's amazing how much water\none loses in the sauna.\n- Like a normal sweat\nrate for someone 225,\nespecially in 20 minutes in a sauna,\nI would absolutely expect\nyou to do three pounds easy,\nwithout like-\n- So I should be drinking more?\n- Probably.\n- Even more water.\n- Yeah, you're probably half\nthe water that you need to get.\n- And you mentioned the\npossible benefits of doing it\nafter strength hypertrophy training,\nwhich makes sense for\nplausible mechanistic reasons,\nno official data there yet.\nWhat about after endurance training?\nAssuming somebody hydrates well enough\nand they're not overheated\nfrom their endurance work.\n- Yeah.\n- [Andrew] Could also be of benefit.\n- Yeah.\n- Wow, so more and more what I'm thinking\nthe framework here is\nin an ideal world, one would\ntrain and then do sauna,\nor heat exposure of some kind.\nEndurance training or\nstrength hypertrophy training,\nand then do sauna, and then\ndo cold exposure on off days,\nor at least four hours away\nfrom any kind of training,\nor if you had to do it close to training,\ndoing it before training.\n- Yeah, I love cold in the morning.\nWe've actually run this experiment\non professional athletes,\nwhere we do enough tracking\nwith things like HRV,\nwhich is a global metric of\nlike overall fatigue, okay.\nAnd you've probably talked\nabout that before but,\nproblems with it, but roughly\nidea of overall fatigue.\nHRV in general, higher the\nscore the better, right?\nSo a low HRV is fatigue, right?\nWell, if you wake up and\ntake your HRV in the morning,\nand then you get into ice,\nwhat's going to happen is you're\ngoing to see that number plummet.\nThe second you get out, that's\ngoing to fall off the Earth,\nwhich means roughly you've\nmoved into a sympathetic place.\nSurprising, you get in 30 degree water,\nyou're going to go very\nsympathetic very quickly.\nHowever, if you continue to\nwatch your HRV for 30, 60, 90,\nand up to two to three hours post,\nyou will generally see\nan improved HRV score\nrelative to where you started.\nSo it's back to this\nhormetic stressor, right?\nA really cold, shocking exposure\nwill be a net result of\nyou being more relaxed\nthroughout the day.\nIn general.\nAnd we've seen that now\nlike very consistently\nacross years, with athletes.\nSo I think it's a great\nway to start your day.\nYou won't need nearly as much coffee\nafter spending three\nminutes in 30 degree water.\n- 30 degrees is pretty darn cold.\nI was in the ocean this morning\nfor about three minutes.\nIt felt, I didn't bring a thermometer,\nbut it felt like somewhere in the low 50s.\n- But 50 and moving is really cold.\n- Yeah.\n- Water's moving.\n- Yeah.\n- Right.\nThat's really cold\n- That's right.\nThe thermal layer that\nsurrounds you when you sit still\nin cold water immersion,\nI'm encouraging people now,\nif they really, I was, joked that\npeople like to look real stoic and tough\nwhen they're in there.\nLike they're just grinding\nthrough it with no pain at all.\nBut the stillness is actually\nreducing the stimulus.\nIf they sift around a little bit,\nyou break up that thermal layer.\nThat's where the real action is.\n- We've joked about this for years.\nLike do 50 degrees with\na whirlpool jet on,\nnow I'm impressed.\n'Cause that is hard.\nYou sit in 35 degree for\nthree minutes, I guess.\nBut with XPT I've seen,\nI can't even tell you\nhow many hundreds of people\nfrom all walks of life,\non all age, that we've been able to get\nin 30-something degree\nwater for three minutes.\n50 degrees with a whirlpool going,\nthat number gets very small.\n- Yeah, and if you don't\nhave access to a whirlpool,\nthis should be reassuring to you, you can,\nsome people say oh, you know,\nI don't have access to ice,\nand ice can actually get pretty expensive,\nif you're doing a $50 ice bath\n- Yeah, it's-\n- every day.\nSo you can fill your bathtub\nwith cool to cold water,\nget in, but just make sure that\nyou keep sifting your limbs\nand it's chilly.\n- Yeah.\n- And the studies on the very well,\nnow well established increases\nin dopamine and epinephrine\nthat occur in cold water exposure,\nwere actually done at an hour\nin 60 degrees Fahrenheit.\n- Yeah.\n- And so it, you don't\nnecessarily need it ice cold\nor an ice bath.\nBut immersion is really\nbetter than the cold shower.\nThe cold shower is kind of a, it's the,\nit's kind of the espresso shot version.\n- Yep, no it's sort of funny,\n'cause if you look at most\nof those initial studies\nand you think, man, how do\nthey get people to sign up\nto spend 45 minutes in 55 degree water.\n55 degrees is cold.\nEven if it's not moving\nand then they're going to not\nspend five minutes in 'em,\nthey're going to go an hour.\nAnd if you've ever done ice\nbaths at that temperature,\nyou know like all right\nafter a few minutes,\nit's not that bad.\nBut man, that's a protocol.\n- Yeah, it's kind of a\ncold endurance protocol.\n'Cause it's one thing to get in\nfor one minute to three minutes,\nand you know you're getting out.\nYou could sing a song,\nyou could do anything\nto distract yourself.\nBut 45 minutes to an hour is intense.\nMaybe they, I don't know.\nI don't think they paid the subjects.\nBut anyway, that study was done\n- Yeah, you think-\n- in Europe,\nI forget where it was done.\nBut anyway, they were hardy subjects.\nI want to talk a bit about\nover-training and gauging recovery.\nSo there are a couple methods\nthat I've heard about,\nand that I use, based on\nsome data that I've seen,\nbut mainly discussions\nwith really informed people\nlike yourself, Brian McKenzie,\nKelly Starrett and others.\nThe two that I'm aware\nof for gauging recovery\nof the nervous system and\nkind of systemic recovery,\nare grip strength,\nespecially grip strength\non waking in the morning.\nAnd the so-called carbon\ndioxide tolerance test.\nThe ability to do a long controlled exhale\nafter a few rhythmic deep breaths.\nWhich I'm assuming taps\ninto both one's ability\nto mechanically control the diaphragm,\nbut also how well one is\nregulating carbon dioxide.\nFirst question is, is\nthis stuff fiction, fact,\nor a combination of kind\nof anecdata, as I call it.\nAre there any peer-reviewed\npublished data?\nIs your lab working on these things?\nAnd am I deluding myself,\nusing these tools,\nor are they useful?\n- It's not fiction at all.\nThere are, with like CO2 tolerance,\nthere's less published data.\nWe've run a study in our lab,\nlooking at the associations\nbetween the CO2 tolerance\nand what we call trait and state anxiety.\nAnd those are in the publication\nprocess, is what I'll say.\n- [Andrew] Great.\n- So you can't really talk\nabout that stuff as you know,\nuntil it's out.\nBut in general I'd say like\nthere's a reason I'm still doing it.\n- Great.\n- I'll just leave it at that.\n- Yeah, well assuming\nit's not a clinical trial,\nI mean, I think sharing\npreliminary findings is fine,\nas long as we highlight\nthem as preliminary.\n- Yeah.\n- I'm not a reviewer,\nbut I look forward to reading the paper.\n- Yeah, but, as you know,\nscientific ethically,\nlike you need to be careful\nabout telling people results\nbefore you've gone through that process.\n- Right, which is why I'm flagging this as\nthese results are not yet passed through\nthe peer review process.\nSo you're hearing about\nit prior to peer review.\n- Yep.\nHaving said that, there's\nenough in that field,\nI'm not the first one into that field.\nAnd so I'm very confident\nthat that's a real thing.\nIn terms of actual tracking recovery,\nthe big picture is this.\nWhen we run through a full analysis,\nwhen we have an athlete go through our\nbiomolecular athlete\nprogram, we're going to run\nand we're going to look at\nthree major categories, okay.\nCategory one are what we\ncall visible stressors.\nAnd then we have hidden stressors.\nAnd then we have recovery capacity.\nAny time the total stress load\noutpaces recovery capacity,\nyou're either going backwards\nin your physical ability,\nor you're reducing adaptability.\nNow you have levers to pull here.\nYou can reduce stress intake,\nor you can increase recovery capacity.\nRight?\nWhat we want in an ideal situation\nis to be able to implement\nthe most stress possible\n'cause that's the driver of adaptation.\nRecover from that.\nNow we get the most adaptation,\nand adaptation being simply a change.\nWhatever change you want it to be.\nThat's our gold standard, right?\nIt's pie in the eye.\nSome people have endogenous differences,\nthey just recover better.\nThey don't.\nThere are genetic factors.\nBut let's talk about the\nones that are manipulatable.\nIf we go to the stress side of it,\nyou want the throttle\nto be pushed as far down\non the ones you want stress from,\nand as far off of the ones\nyou don't want stress,\nso that the adaptation comes\nin the exact area you want.\nAnd you're not burning gas\nin something you don't care about.\nBecause you're just,\nyou're taking that total\nstress bucket too high.\nRecovery capacity over there.\nSo here's how you can do that.\nYou can run some analytics\nand measure what we do with everyone,\nthrough these very\ncomprehensive breakdowns,\nto figure out what's\nthat physiology look like\nhidden and visible, and then\nwhat's the recovery capacity.\nOnce we have that blueprint,\nwe can now figure out what\nare the two or three things\nwe need to track, that\nare these indicators\nof what we call performance anchors.\nSo an anchor is something\nthat kind of drags behind you\nor below you, that slows you down.\nThe analogy being, let's\nsay we're going down\none of these amazing canyon roads,\nand I won't say which canyon we're in,\nso you can stay hidden here.\nAnd your car's going down\nat a certain velocity\nand you want to go faster.\nMost people's first impulse\nis to hit the gas, the accelerator.\nWe want to push.\nWell, that's fine, but if\nyour foot is on the brake\nand you push the accelerator,\nyou might go a little bit faster.\nBut number one, you're\nwasting a lot of literal gas\nto go a little bit faster.\nAnd two, you're burning your engine.\nYou might, you're going to blow.\nThe easier solution is just\ntake your foot off the brake.\nYou're going to go faster\nby just stopping yourself.\nThen if that's not fast enough,\nwe can hit the accelerator.\nEveryone wants to just push down, right?\nMore stimulus, more optimization.\nBing, bing, bing, bing, here.\nOur first analytics are,\nwhere are these performance anchors?\nWhat's dragging you back?\nWhat's putting down the brake?\nI want to move those two or\nthree things out of the way,\nand now let's see how far you get.\nOh, look at that.\nYour recovery capacity has gone way up.\nYour adaptations are happening faster now.\nAnd we can do more work because\nyou're recovering quicker.\nSo we're trying to figure\nout in those buckets,\nand we have a whole host\nof things that we measure,\nbiomarkers and surveys,\nand everything else that we go through,\nto find out what's there.\nSo after we've done that,\nnow we're just going to track\na few of these recovery\nmarkers along the way\nto figure out what's globally happening.\nSo that could mean grip strength.\nI have some folks who are going\nto test grip strength daily.\nOthers, we're going to look\nat HRV or combinations.\nWe may look at performance\nmetrics like a force plate.\nSo you're going to do a\nvertical jump every single day.\nAnd we're going to see where that's at.\nWe've used the tap test before,\nwhich is how many times\nyou can tap your finger\nas fast as possible.\nIt's a rough indicator of\ncentral nervous system.\n- In a say one minute interval.\n- Exactly.\nAnd this is apps you can do on,\nthis is like you tap this\nfinger as fast as you can.\nIt's going to say hey,\nyou did 60 taps today\nand your average is 75.\n- I like that 'cause it taps\ninto, ha, no pun intended,\ninto upper motor neuron capacity.\n- Hundred percent.\n- Because a lot of\nthings like, like grip strength obviously,\nI have to send the deliberate\nsignal to my hand to grip.\nBut at some point the lower motor neurons\nare going to be taking over\nthe majority of the work.\nLike the signal is probably one and done.\nWhereas the tapping is going to be\nrepetitive sending of signals\nfrom upper motor neurons.\n- Yep.\nSo some of the athletes I work with,\nwe track blood every day,\nwe track urine every day,\nwe track ideally a combination of\nsubjective and objective measures.\nEverything from how\ndid you feel last night\nto environmental sensors of their bedroom.\nFull PSGs going on, running\nlike actual sleep diagnostics,\nnot an Oura ring, nothing against Oura,\nbut like full analytics,\nand some of 'em it's as\nsimple as how'd you feel today\nand what was your vertical jump, right?\nSo we're going to put people\nin a position to succeed.\nWe're going to figure out\nwhat's the lever that they need to pull,\nas well as what's their aptitude?\nWhat sport are they in?\nWhat can we realistically get away with?\nAnd some of them will\ntake machines with them\nand will do blood every day and urine\nand all kinds of stuff,\nand some of them it's a lot lower.\n- For myself, I'm not,\nas I mentioned before,\nI'm not a big fan of devices.\nI'm trying to wear the wristwatch.\nI tend to go off feel, which is not,\nit's not the ideal objective\nway to gauge things.\nBut part of my reasoning for this is\nmy colleague from the psychology\ndepartment, Dr. Alia Crum,\nhas done some studies where they've given,\ndeliberately given people false\nfeedback about their sleep.\nSo told people you didn't sleep very well,\nor they've told people\nyou slept really well,\nand performance can be driven\nin the expected direction,\nbased on feedback,\nindependent of how well\npeople slept or didn't sleep.\nNow that doesn't mean you can take someone\nthat only slept two hours,\nor was up every 30 seconds\n'cause of apnea, and tell\nthem they slept great,\nand they're going to perform\ngreat cognitive tasks.\nBut you can take someone\nwho slept very well,\ntell them that their recovery\nquotient wasn't very good,\nand their output is going to be worse.\nAnd that's my concern about\na lot of devices out there,\nnot to name specific devices.\nBut it's still unclear\nto the general public,\nwhat the specific algorithms are\nto generate these recovery scores, right?\nAnd so many of the things\nthat reportedly track sleep,\naren't tracking sleep,\n- Not even close.\n- they're tracking\nheart rate and breathing,\nwhich are correlates of sleep\ndepth, but that's different.\nAnd again, I'm not knocking those,\nI think the sleep\ntrackers, if nothing else,\nhave provided a forum whereby\npeople are very conscious\nof getting good sleep.\nIt's sort of like knowing\nthe total chloric intake of\nyour food, people go wow,\nI'm actually eating a\nlot more than I thought.\n- It's calibration.\n- Or less, in some cases.\nBut often the case is that it's more.\nSo I think for the typical person,\nI'm wondering whether or not, like myself,\n'cause I'm not a competitive athlete\nor certainly not a professional athlete,\ncompetitive with myself I\nsuppose, but no one else.\nMorning pulse rate I\ntend to take on waking.\nIf I wake out of a really stressful dream,\nI might relax a little bit and\nthen just take my pulse rate,\nkind of get a range,\nand see if it's spiking\nfor whatever reason.\nI don't tend to measure grip strength,\nalthough I've heard you can\njust use a classic scale.\n- Yeah.\n- [Andrew] Old fashioned scale with the-\n- Sure.\n- Old fashioned.\nOr some other more technical\ndevice is probably good,\nif there's a low cost one.\n- Yeah, they're all low cost.\n- And then the carbon dioxide\ntolerance test.\n- Yeah.\n- So we haven't really talked\nabout that in specific ways.\nMy understanding of it is\nit's four deep slow breaths,\nin through the nose, out through the nose,\nand then a big inhale, that's max exhale,\nand then time duration of\nexhale through the nose,\nand then stopping the\nstopwatch at the point\nwhere lungs are empty.\nNot necessarily as long as\none could hold their breath.\nDid I get that right?\n- Pretty much.\n- Okay, and I guess we should\ncredit you and Brian McKenzie.\n- Yeah, those guys.\n- Yeah.\n- For sure.\n- And the folks under Brian's umbrella\nfor really establishing this\nas a really good metric.\nWhen and how can I use the\ncarbon dioxide tolerance test\nto gauge recovery upon\nwaking, post-training session?\n- Yeah.\n- Would that be a good time?\n- Number one answer is,\nwhatever you do be consistent.\nSo do it under the, like\nany good science experiment,\ndo it under the exact same\nconditions as you can.\nThat generally means\nsomewhere in the morning,\n'cause that's when you're\nprobably going to have\nthe most control, most stability.\nSo yeah, like you would take\nany HRV or other metric,\nwake up, get under\ncontrol, get stabilized,\ntake your metric.\n- [Andrew] Got it.\n- Going to be pretty good.\n- Got it.\nSodium bicarb.\n- Yeah.\n- Baking soda.\nRumor has it, and data has it,\nthat it can actually be a\npretty effective training tool.\n- Very effective.\n- Could you explain a little\nbit of about how it works,\nand how one might explore\nusing sodium bicarb\nto enhance training output,\nin a couple of different contexts?\n- Yeah.\nSo there's a handful of these\nubiquitously effective\nsupplements for performance.\nSodium bicarbonate's one of them,\nand it's a very ingenious\nidea 'cause it's so simple.\nEffectively, muscle contraction happens\nbecause enzymatic function occurs\nwithin a fairly specific pH range, right?\nSo if it gets extremely\nacidic, it doesn't like it.\nAnd so whether you're running\nthrough aerobic glycolysis\nor anaerobic, or anything\nelse, all these things require,\neven ATP hydrolysis requires ATPases.\nEnzymes don't function well\noutside of this fairly special range.\nSo what happens is generally fatigue,\nthe sensations of fatigue\nare actually caused by\nsome signal that hey, we're\nstarting to run out of pH.\nOr we're getting in the wrong range.\nYou're not out of gas usually,\nyou're not too low on oxygen.\nYou're not running low\non muscle glycogen yet.\nYou're typically going to see signs,\nor feel signals of\nfatigue way prior to that,\nmostly being pH issues.\nThat being said, what if we\ncould regulate pH better?\nEnter bicarbonate, right?\nSo without going too far into metabolism,\neffectively what happens\nis you take an inhale,\nand you're mostly breathing in oxygen, O2.\nWhen you exhale your breathing out CO2.\nSo the difference is you've\ngained a carbon somehow.\nWell, all of your\ncarbohydrates in your body\ncome in the form of long carbon chains.\nIn fact, that's what a carbohydrate means.\nIt is a one carbon molecule\nthat has one water molecule attached.\nIt's a carbon that has been hydrated.\nIn the case of like glucose, blood sugar,\nlet's say six carbon molecule, right?\nIn terms of fat, which\nare the only two places\nyou're going to get most\nof your cellular energy\ncarbohydrates into fat,\nthat is also a big long\nblock in chain of carbons.\nSo whether you're getting your energy\nfrom fat or carbohydrate, you're\ngoing to split those atoms.\nSo in other words,\nyou've got six carbons\nattached to each other,\nand in this part of\nchemistry it's exergonic.\nSo when you break that carbon bond,\nso break one of those\ncarbons off from the other,\nthat's going to release energy.\nJust like if you had a pencil in here,\nand I snapped it and\nit'd go bang, and pop.\nI broke the bonds that were\nconnecting that graphite\nto the next piece of graphite,\nand that released energy.\n'Cause I put energy into\nthe system, et cetera.\nOkay.\nAs a result though, we've now had\nsay five or six carbons chained together.\nWe broke one off the end,\nwhich is not how it works,\nbut making the point.\nAnd now you have one free-floating carbon\nused that energy release\nto then go make ATP,\nto then go make your muscles contract.\nBut now you've got carbon floating around.\nYou can associate free-floating carbon\nwith being at a higher acidic level.\nIt's not going to happen.\nThe only way that you're going\nto go through this process\nis if your body says do we have\nan oxygen molecule available\nthat we can bind this to immediately?\nYes we do.\nThat carbon attaches to\nthat oxygen molecule.\nYou can't just put CO2 in the blood\nbecause of what we just talked about.\nSo you're going to bind it\nthrough this bicarbonate process.\nIt's going to go through your blood.\nIt's going to go into the lungs.\nIt's going to go back into\nits carbon dioxide molecule.\nIt's going to trans, go through\nthe alveoli into the lungs\nand you're going to exhale.\nSo you went from carbon to\nthis bicarbonate system,\nback into carbon, exhale.\nSo inhaled, O2 plants go\nthe opposite by the way.\nSo they're going to breathe in the CO2,\nthey're going to cleave off that carbon,\nstack those carbons together,\nand that's how they get larger.\nIn your blood, those six carbon\nchains are called glucose.\nIf we store that in your\nmuscle, we call it glycogen.\nSo we take a bunch of glucose\nand stack it together.\nIn a plant, we call that starch.\nThat's effectively what it is, right?\nSo you take a bunch of\ncarbon from the atmosphere,\nstuck it all together,\nand that's a starch.\nIf you want to do it in the form of fruit,\nwe take that starch like from the ground,\nyou put it up through the tree,\ngo all the way up to the\ntop, put it into the flower,\nbreak it up into these\nbig huge chunks of starch,\ninto little forms called\nfructose or glucose.\nThat's why fruit has fructose in it,\nand that's why tubers and\nstuff have starch in them.\nBasically starch in an\nanimal is glycogenesis.\nOkay.\nAll that to say,\nif that's happening and\nwe know that a byproduct\nspecifically of anaerobic glycolysis\nmeaning the breakdown of\ncarbohydrates for fuel,\ntypically in a very fast pace\nwith low oxygen availability,\nthe downside of that\nequation is acid production.\nWe know that that's a problem,\n'cause I started the conversation\noff there intentionally.\nSo what if we could\nreduce the acid buildup?\nNow you know how pH kind of works,\nI went and kind of double\nnegatives there, right?\nYou don't want too much acid buildup.\nThen could we prolong and sustain energy\nin a more effective pace,\nespecially in this anaerobic\ninterval kind of environment?\nAnd again, that's important\nbecause in those things,\nfailure is not a result of\nrunning out of fuel or oxygen.\nIt's a result of fatigue\nbuilding up way too quickly.\n- Is that also true for\nresistance training?\n- Uh, depends.\n- There's maybe more of\nthe creatine phosphate system.\n- That can be an issue.\nIt could simply be an\nissue of force production.\nYou just don't have enough force,\nleast you're not out of energy.\nYou just can't muster enough force.\nYou do enough reps, then it's\ngoing to be an issue there.\nCreatine phosphate though\nwould be the big winner, depending.\nSo to come back a little\nbit to the beginning,\nand then I'll, I'm circling\nthis all together intentionally.\nAll right.\nWell, the way that we produce energy\nis going to be in two primary categories,\nanaerobic and aerobic.\nAerobic meaning with oxygen,\nanaerobic meaning without.\nIn terms of muscle contraction,\nyou're pretty much talking\nabout carbohydrates or fat.\nNow fat is going to be\nexclusively aerobic,\nmeaning I'm going to use fat\nfrom the entire body, roughly equally.\nSo you're doing a sprint up a hill,\nand your hamstrings or\nyour glutes or your quads\nare on fire.\nYou're not just going to use the fat\nthat's directly in those hamstrings.\nYou're going to lose it\nfrom the entire body.\nIt has to go through lipolysis,\nso it's in this stored\nform in adipose tissue.\nIt's got to get broken\ndown, put into blood.\nBlood's going to have\nto go through your body,\nget taken up into muscle,\ntaken up through muscle\ninto the mitochondria.\nThen we're going to have\nto go through this process\ncalled beta-oxidation.\nSo remember, carbohydrates\nand glucose especially\nis a six carbon molecule.\nFat, if it's in the\nform of a triglyceride,\nit is a three carbon\nglycerol backbone, and three,\ntri, one, two, three, fatty acids.\nThree carbon backbone,\nand those fatty acids are just\nbig, long chains of carbon.\nThat's all it is, right?\nSo we're going to break that\nthing down, put it in the blood,\nmove it up, move it into our mitochondria.\nYou can't walk those things\nacross the mitochondria wall.\nThey're too big.\nSo what you have to do is\ncleave them off into little chunks,\nand it turns out we break 'em\noff into two carbon chunks,\nso we call it beta, as in two,\nmove those into mitochondria.\nThat can go through this little\nthing called Krebs cycle,\nor tricyclic acid cycle,\nand you kick out a bunch\nof energy out of that.\nYou add two carbons, so as\na result of that process,\nyou're going to generate\ntwo carbon dioxides.\nBut remember, you can only\ngo through that process\nif oxygen is available,\nbecause you have to be able to place\nthose carbons onto something.\nOr acid gets up way too high, too fast.\nThis is one of the reasons\nwhy fat is a nice fuel source,\nbut it's very slow.\nIt takes physical time\nto move from the back of your\nshoulder, into your blood,\ndown your hamstring\nuptake, uptake, uptake.\nIn addition, it's required\noxygen availability.\nIf you need energy faster,\nyou simply don't have the time\nto bring in the oxygen,\ntransport it through,\ngo through capillaries,\nexchange through a tissue, et cetera.\nCarbohydrate, on the other hand,\nis going to be stored locally\nin the exercising muscle cell,\nand specifically in the cytoplasm.\n- As glycogen.\n- As glycogen in the store there.\nSo what's going to happen initially,\nyour initial demands for\nexercise, or for fuel,\nare going to come from the glycogen stored\nwithin the muscle fiber itself.\nIt's just going to break right there,\nand you're going to be off the races.\nSo you have the six carbon molecules,\nyou're going to break it into two separate\nthree carbon molecules.\nOkay, boom, that breaking\nprovides you a tiny bit of energy,\nvery small but some.\nNow you're going to take those\ntwo three carbon molecules,\nand you want to be able to oxidize them,\n'cause that's your only next step.\nBut in order to do that,\nyou got to go those into mitochondria.\nSo you got to break one\nof those molecules off.\nSo then you'll be back to\nyour two carbon molecule,\njust like you did with fat.\nThat's going to go into mitochondria,\nand then it's going to go through\nthe exact same Krebs cycle,\ntwo carbons, et cetera.\nBut hold on.\nIf you don't have sufficient oxygen,\nor sufficient mitochondria availability,\nand you're stuck at that\ntwo three carbon place,\nwhat the do you do?\nYou have problems, right?\nNow we have to say, okay, wait a minute.\nWe have three carbon molecule,\nand we have a bunch of this acid buildup.\nNow acid functionally is hydrogen.\nThat's what pH, potential hydrogen\nis what pH stands for, right?\nSo if hydrogen is\nbuilding up as a byproduct\nof muscular contraction,\nand then you're having\nthis three carbon molecule,\nwhat it can actually do is\ngrab one of those hydrogens.\nAnd those three carbon\nmolecules, by the way,\nare called pyruvic, pyruvic acid, right?\nIf you take a pyruvic acid\nand you grab a hydrogen,\nput it on top of it, we now\nhave a different name for it.\nIt's called?\n- [Andrew] Hydrogen peroxide.\n- Lactate.\nBingo, right?\nThat's what lactate, or\nlactic acid is, right?\nSo we've now built that up.\nSo number one reason why lactate's\nnot causing your fatigue,\nit's actually preventing it\nand that it does a bunch\nof other really cool stuff.\nBut the point is, that\nsystem can only last so long.\nThat gets overwhelmed very quickly.\nWhat are you going to do with\nthe rest of this hydrogen?\nWell, if you started off\nin a normal pH range,\nyou don't have very far to go\nbefore you've now gone into\nthat level of too much acidity.\nIf you start off in a more basic,\nand basic I don't mean simple,\nI mean chemistry, right,\nand more alkaline, then that\nsame amount of increase in pH\nis no longer, now it just puts you back\nin your physiological range.\nSo sodium bicarbonate,\nwhether taken as a cream,\nor a powder, or baking\nsoda, or anything else,\ncan simply put you in a more\nalkaline state, even acutely.\nSo this is something\nyou can take right now,\nbefore your workout.\nYou're going to delay,\nwhat we call delay the\nprogression of fatigue.\n- And how would people start\nto approach this practice?\nMy understanding is you\ncan do this with common\nstore bought baking soda.\n- [Andy] No question.\n- There's always a concern\nabout gastric distress.\n- Oh boy.\n- That it's a very effective laxative,\nsometimes an unwanted laxative effect.\nBut how would one approach this before?\nLet's say I'm going to, I'm\ndoing the mile repeats exercise.\nMile repeats protocol that\nwe talked about earlier.\nI'm doing that for a few months,\nand now I want to try the\nsodium bicarb approach.\nI'm well hydrated,\nhopefully I'm well rested.\nI'm ready to go.\nWhen am I going to drink\nthis sodium bicarb solution?\nHow would I make the solution?\nLet's say I take 10 ounces of water.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- How much bicarb do I want to,\nsodium bicarb should I put in there?\nCan we come up with a,\nis it half a teaspoon?\nIs it a teaspoon?\n- Here's how I'm going to tell you.\nYou will thank me by starting lower.\nYou can always go more later.\n- So a little pinch.\n- [Andy] You cannot go backwards.\n- How about I start\nwith a quarter teaspoon?\n- Fine.\nHalf, honestly, half is fine.\n- Half a teaspoon.\n- It's totally fine.\n- Dissolve that.\nSlug that down.\nI read a study recently that showed\nthat people will hit the\npeak benefits of this\nat different times, but it's somewhere,\nif memory serves me correctly,\nsomewhere between 60 and 90 minutes later.\nSo I might want to drink\nit on the way to the track.\n- It can, it can be as low as 20.\n- Okay.\nSo maybe as I get to the tracks,\nand so I'm going to do some\nwarmup with some walk and jogging.\n- I say 45 minutes.\n- [Andrew] Okay.\n- That's just a very rough standard.\nBut yeah, you're right,\nit is individualized.\nAnd you probably want to\nplay with that a little bit.\nIf not, just somewhere in the\nneighborhood of 20 to an hour.\n- Okay.\nAnd then the perceived and real\nfatigue, if done correctly,\nthe perceived and real\nfatigue ought to be reduced.\n- Yes.\n- I can do more work\nwithout feeling exhausted.\nWill I feel less of a lactate burn?\n- Yep.\n- Done in air quotes\nfor those listening,\nI realize that's a very\ncrude way to describe\na complex physiological process.\nFantastic.\nCan sodium bicarb be used repeatedly\nfor longer duration training?\n- Yep.\n- And if I were going to\nuse it with weight training,\nfor whatever reason,\nmaybe I'm doing circuit type training\nor I'm doing the super\nset type strength training\nthat you talked about before,\npush, pull, push, pull,\nwhere it's a little bit more\ncardiovascularly demanding.\nThen maybe I'd sip that\nthroughout the workout,\nmake sure there's a bathroom\nnearby, it sounds like,\n'cause I do, I am aware\nthat many people get\npretty serious gastric distress.\n- It can happen very quickly.\n- Okay.\nGreat, well it sounds like\nan amazing training tool.\nI really appreciate you\nsharing it 'cause I think it's,\nit's one that doesn't get a\nlot of air time these days\n'cause it's been around,\nbut sounds like it has some\npretty impressive effects.\n- Yeah, you know what's\nsort of funny about that is,\nI mean, I get it, pop\nculture is what it is.\nBut still to this day,\nif you want to talk about\nsort of your most effective general health\nslash performance supplementation,\nit's the same three to four to five.\nAnd it's because they work really well.\n- Without going into the\nchemistry of each one\nin the practice, each one,\n'cause I definitely want to\nget you back to talk about\nnutrition and supplementation.\n- Oh yeah.\n- At some point.\nBut I think we need a full couple of hours\nto get that, right.\n- Yep.\n- At least.\nIf, as a teaser, would\nyou mind just listing off\nthe other supplements that you\nhave found are very effective\nfor many people?\nSo sodium bicarb, or baking soda is one.\nWhat are some of the other ones?\n- Yep, we'll go kind of in reverse order.\nBeta alanine is another very\nclassically effective one.\nSimilar idea to sodium\nbicarbonate, so it's going to,\nbeta alanine's going to come in,\nit's going to be converted and stored as\nwhat's called carnosine in the muscle.\nAnd carnosine is an intracellular buffer.\nSo in other words,\nit's just going to delay\nthe buildup of acid.\nSo fatigue blocker, if you will.\nSo very effective, very cheap, very safe.\nWell studied.\nThe top one though, of all of them by far\nthat has an incredibly\nstrong safety profile.\nIt has, it is a cheap, it\nis a simple form to get,\nhas a important magnitude of effect,\nand is effective across multiple domains\nof physical health and performance.\nAnd it is because of that\nit is my crown jewel.\nIt is in my opinion, without question,\nthe Michael Jordan of all supplementation.\nAnd that's creatine monohydrate.\nIt affects so many things.\nWe typically think about it\nas it's muscle stuff, right?\nYou've talked kind of, you\nquickly were talking about\nthe creatine phosphate system.\nBut we have to realize the\nvast majority of research\non creatine phosphate is\nnot in sport performance,\nand has not been for 20 years.\nIt's in clinical.\nAnd it has everything from\neffects on the neurological system,\nto there have been associations\nto mental health and depression.\nAnd to be very clear,\nI am certainly not saying\nyou can take creatine\nand cure anything.\nAnd I'm not saying it's going to stop you\nfrom depression or anything.\nBut I'm saying there's a lot\nof research in these areas\nand there's a reason people are doing it.\n- Yeah, I completely agree.\nAnd if you're willing, I'd\nlove to have you back for us\nto do a discussion on\ncreatine in the brain,\nor creatine in the nervous system.\n- Yeah.\n- That would be a lot of fun,\nand maybe we can do a\nkind of a journal club\nin advance of that.\n- Yeah.\n- For those that don't know,\na journal club is where\nscientists read a bunch of papers\nand then argue about them, discuss them,\nand try and extract the kind\nof agreed upon center of mass,\nif you will.\nI think, I've long been taking five grams\nof creatine monohydrate per day,\nmainly for the cognitive effects.\n- [Andy] Yeah.\n- I sense an effect,\nthat's obviously anecdata,\nbut I think there are a\nlot of data out there,\nas you alluded to.\n- There's enough.\nYou're not crazy.\nThere's enough there.\nAnd in fact, there's enough mechanism now\nto understand the metabolic needs.\nPeople think, I'm a muscle guy, right,\nso I'm going to think\nabout the metabolism needed\nto fuel muscle.\nBut we forget cells, immune\ncells, red blood cells,\nnerve cells, astrocytes, brain,\nall this stuff requires energy,\nand it's all going through metabolism.\n- Super interesting.\nWe'll do the deep dive on that soon.\nI have a final question for you.\nYou're involved in a really interesting,\nI think really cutting edge project,\nthat I first learned about from you.\nI don't know of anyone else doing anything\nas forward thinking,\nand frankly as relevant\nto the general population,\nbecause of my interest in\npeople getting better sleep\nand learning how to do that,\navoiding stress and\nlearning how to do that.\nTell us a little bit about\nwhat I believe is called absolute rest.\n- Right.\nSo this is something that\nwe've been playing with\nbehind the scenes for a long time.\nAnd this is typically how\nhigh performance stuff works, right?\nPeople want exclusivity\nand so this has been built.\nEffectively, what happened\nis a friend of mine,\nCody Burkhart, I don't know\nif you know Cody, but a-\n- Down in Texas.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- NASA.\n- NASA guy.\nYeah I do know Cody.\n- Wonderful, just down the road thinker.\nEveryone's interested in sleep, right?\nAnd for forever I would say,\nwe're using with athletes,\nbut everything available\ntells you how you're sleeping.\nNothing can tell you why\nyou're sleeping that way.\nAnd so we got together in Boulder\nand then I met some of\nhis former colleagues,\ncomputer science folks, Harvard MD,\nand some really impressive tech folks.\nAnd we were just thinking about an idea.\nAnd we came up with,\nand we started to realize\nthe problems, right?\nWe used first principle thinking,\nit's one of my favorite approaches.\nIf you're not familiar\nwith that, go Google that.\nLike that's just a\nrecipe to solve problems,\nis first principle thinking.\nAnd we just started to\nthink about like, man,\nall the sleep tech is there, it's real,\nI don't need to convince\npeople that they need sleep.\nEveryone's done that.\nYou need high quality sleep,\nbut how can I provide solutions?\nAnd with the people I work with,\nI can't just tell them\nyour testosterone's down\nor your sleep's down, or recovery.\nI need to be able to be like,\nthis is down, and here's why,\nand here's our solution.\nThat's how our high\nperformance world works.\nSo enter absolute rest.\nThis is saying, okay, what are\nthe actual nodes that go into\nhigh effective, high quality sleep?\nNumber one is psychology.\nSo there has to be some sort\nof screening diagnostic for,\nare you not sleeping because of simply\nyou can't control yourself?\nAnd you've done a wonderful\njob of giving people tools.\nOr if you can't quiet your\nmind before sleep do this,\nif you wake up and you\ncan't go back to sleep,\nhere are a bunch of things, right?\nSo we have some screens that we can do,\nand there's some other\nstuff we can do to analyze.\nThis is a psychological issue.\nLet's say it's not, right?\nYou're under control.\nAnd we have different\ntricks we use and stuff,\nwhich I'm happy to talk about.\nBut it's not that.\nOkay, is it physiology?\nWhich is node number two.\nDo we know what your\ndopamine levels are like?\nDo we know what your\nserotonin levels are like?\nWhat's melatonin look like?\nWhat's adrenaline, what's cortisol,\ncortisol being the primary driver?\nWhat is this relationship DHEA,\nwhere are these things at?\nSo we're going to measure\nall that and track that.\nWe're going to measure that\nduring the day, prior to sleep,\nwe're going to measure that next morning,\nand even sometimes throughout sleep.\nAnd we're going to figure out,\nis this a physiology problem?\nIf it is, then we have clear corrections.\nIf not, we're going to go\non the next step, which is,\nis this possibly a pathology?\nSo you have some sort of sleep disorder.\nWe're going to run full\nP, what's called PSG.\nSo polysomnography.\nThe exact same stuff you\nwould get in a sleep clinic.\nIt's a sensor that's going to go on there\nmeasuring EEG and EOG,\nand we're going to have\nmuscle activation sensor\nto see if your legs are moving,\nand everything else is going on.\nAnd we're going to get a full diagnostic.\nAnd if anyone's ever done this,\nthe amount of sleep issues\nthat are happening in people\nthat they don't even realize\nis extraordinarily high.\nSo we're going to figure this out.\nOne very quick example,\nwe just did this with\na professional athlete,\nand he was having like 280 roughly\nof these episodes per night.\nAnd to be categorized as an episode,\nyou have to meet these\nfour specific criteria.\nOxygen saturation, ventilation\nchanges, brain changes,\net cetera, and he hit that\nover 280 times a night.\nAnd what this technology\nallowed us to do is figure out\nwhat position did all\nthese things occur in.\nWell, in his particular case,\nmost of them were happening,\nhe was on his back.\nAnd so he bought a very\nsimple like pillow basically\nthat went on his back,\nthat kept him from sleeping on his back.\nAnd we saw an 85% reduction\nin sleep awakeness issues,\nthe very first night.\nNow we did that.\nTestosterone eventually tripled\nafter three months by\njust improving sleep.\nAnd all we did is move him\nonto his left or right side.\nSo huge improvements,\njust by understanding\nwhere the problem occurred,\nand why it occurred there.\nWe didn't have to change\nhardly anything else.\nHe had the basic hygiene\nstuff down and temperature\nand all that stuff.\nAnd he had his ChiliPad and all that\nto keep the thing cool.\nWe couldn't fix it.\nYears, by the way, this took us two years\nof just trying everything.\nWe're like, man.\nAnd it was just like, I wish,\nI wish we could get you to sleep better.\nAnd we, I pulled out every\ntrick I knew, and it just was,\nas soon as we built this [indistinct]\nI'm like oh my God, it's all.\nHe's not overweight by the\nway, he doesn't have any,\nhe's not iron deficient,\ndoesn't have any of these\nother classical symptoms\nthat are associated with bad sleep.\nSupplementation, everything we've done,\na thousand protocols.\nThat fixed it overnight.\nSo if it's not psychology,\nand it's not physiology,\nand it's not pathology, then the last one\nthat people don't have any\nidea about is environment.\nAnd so what you don't\nrealize is we have a box.\nWe can sit right next to your bed.\nYou just plug it in, you\ndon't have to do anything.\nAnd it's going to run\nfull environmental scans.\nSo it's going to look at the\ntemperature in your room.\nIt's going to look at the\nhumidity in your room.\nIt's going to look at the\nvolatile organic acid.\nThese are things that are\nseeping out from your mattress.\nIt's going to look at\nparticulates in the air,\nand possible allergens and\nthings that are floating around\nthat are closing your nose off,\nso you can't sleep at night\nand now you're mouth breathing,\nand you've talked a lot,\nI'm sure, on the previous\nepisodes about why that's bad.\nIt's going to look at your CO2 cloud.\nSo we've talked, we've already\nset this point up, right?\nYou're inhaling O2, but\nthen you're exhaling CO2.\nWell during the day, and\nwhen we're conversing,\nyou have quite a bit of force\nwith that exhalation, right?\nBut at night, it's just barely\nseeping out of your mouth.\nSo what happens is, CO2 tends to cloud up\nand build around your face,\nand then you end up re-breathing that CO2.\nAnd this can cause a large\nnumber of sleep problems\nbecause you're simply\nre-breathing in the panic.\nWhether you're fully awake\nor just kick out of a sleep stage,\nthe CO2 around your face is a big issue.\nThis stuff has all been known, by the way,\nwith the astronauts for a very long time.\nIt just hasn't translated into the,\nto the commercial spaces.\nOf course, gone to our\nhigh performer space.\nSo we can measure that as well.\nAnd then we can figure out\nlike for the most extreme,\nwe can actually come into a bedroom\nand build an entire sleep\noptimization set up,\nand control the entire thing.\nBut for most folks, the\nminimum we can do is\nrun full diagnostics and check off\nis this environmental\nrelated, is it pathology,\nis there something else?\n- So is this a commercial device\nthat people can eventually access?\n- It is now.\n- So where can people learn\nmore about absolute rest?\n- Absoluterest.com.\n- Very cool.\nAnd just for our full disclosure,\nI wasn't aware that you had\ndone this prior to today,\nwhat you'd mentioned.\nI always like to ask people,\nscientists or otherwise,\nI always love to ask what are\nyou most excited about lately?\nAnd this sounds like\nan amazing technology.\n- And just to be really clear,\nthat's not like something\nwe're working on.\nThat's landed.\n- That's landed.\n- We're ready to go.\n- Great.\nWell, and that's one of the\nthings I appreciate about you\nis that you're willing\nto sometimes speculate,\nbut you always say it's speculation.\nBut in general, you seem\nlike the kind of guy\nwhere if you're going to be\npublic facing about something,\nif you're going to make a statement,\nthere's got to be quite a bit behind it.\nYou're not going to allude\nto the, in 10 years,\nwe might be able to do this.\nOr in five years.\nYou're a very data-driven kind of guy.\n- Yeah, well, the people I work with,\nwe need answers, right?\nWe don't have that timeframe.\nAnd we typically have like,\nhey, we start the season in four weeks.\n- Yeah.\n- So that's just where I'm at.\n- Well, as I said, I\nappreciate that about you,\nbut it is but one of the\nmany things I appreciate.\nI think the listeners\nand I can well appreciate\non the basis of today's discussion,\nwhat a enormous wealth\nof information you are.\nHow clear and potently you\ncommunicate that information.\nAnd also how you can take\na huge cloud of information\nand still distill it into protocols\nthat ought to work for 75%\nof people, 75% of the time,\nwhich is an immensely\nvaluable thing to do.\nSo for me and from the\nlisteners, I just want to say,\nthank you so much for taking\nthe, several now hours,\nI lose track of time, which\nreflects all good things.\nSeveral hours to take\na break from teaching,\ntake a break from research,\ntake a break from the\nother important commitments\nof your life, and really share with us\nall this incredible information.\nI'm so, so grateful.\n- My pleasure, man.\nI'm glad we finally got to connect.\nThis has been a long time in the making.\n- It has, and I'm going to\nbring the breathing protocols\nto my training.\nI'm going to start doing\nmore of the endurance type\nand interval type training.\nI'm going to start moving when I do heat,\nI'm going to start moving when I do cold.\nI might even start throwing\nsome sodium bicarb into,\nvery small amount of sodium\nbicarb into some water\nbefore I train.\nAnd listen, Andy, Professor Andy Galpin,\nthank you ever so much.\n- My pleasure.\n- Thank you for joining\nme today for my discussion\nwith Dr. Andy

discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like sleep,\nand focus, and energy,\nand many other features of our physiology,\nand mental functioning.\nThere are some important\nissues to consider\nwhen considering supplements.\nOne of those issues is the\nquality of the ingredients.\nFor that reason, we've partnered\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne supplements\nhave the highest possible standards\nwith respect to the quality of\nthe ingredients they include.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthat's T-H-O-R-N-E dot com,\nslash the letter U slash Huberman,\nand there you'll see the\nsupplements that I take,\nand you can get 20% off\nany of those supplements.\nIf you navigate further\ninto the Thorne site\nthrough that website,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\nThere I discuss science\nand science-based tools,\nsome of which overlap with the content of\nthe \"Huberman Lab Podcast\",\nbut much of which is distinct\nfrom the information covered\non this podcast.\nThank you once again for\njoining me for my discussion\nwith Dr. Andy Galpin, and as always,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
