    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[authoritative music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to discuss salt,\nalso referred to as sodium.\nNow, most of us think of salt\nas something that we\nput on and in our food,\nmaybe something to avoid.\nMaybe some of you are actually\ntrying to get more salt.\nSome of you are trying to get less salt.\nWe all seem to associate salt\nwith things like blood\npressure, et cetera.\nToday, we are going to go down\na different set of avenues\nrelated to salt.\nWe will certainly cover how\nsalt regulates blood pressure.\nWe are also going to talk about\nhow the brain regulates\nour appetite for salt\nor our aversion for salt.\nWe are also going to talk about\nhow our sensing of salty tastes\nactually mediates how much sugar we crave\nand whether or not we\ningest more or less sugar\nthan we actually need,\nso what you're going to learn today\nis that the so-called salt system,\nmeaning the cells and\nconnections in our brain and body\nthat mediate salt craving and avoidance,\nare regulating many, many\naspects of our health\nand our ability to perform\nin various contexts,\nthings like athletic performance,\nthings like cognitive performance.\nWe're also going to talk\nabout aging and dementia\nand avoiding aging and dementia\nand what role salt and salt\navoidance might play in that.\nWe're going to touch on some themes that,\nfor some of you, might seem controversial,\nand indeed, if they are controversial,\nI'll be sure to highlight them as such.\nI'm going to cover a lot of new data\nthat point to the possibility,\nI want to emphasize the possibility,\nthat for some people,\nmore salt might help them\nin terms of health, cognitive,\nand bodily functioning,\nand for other people, less\nsalt is going to be better.\nI'm going to talk about what\nthe various parameters are.\nI'm going to give you\nsome guidelines that,\nin concert with your physician,\nwho you should absolutely talk to\nbefore adding or changing anything\nto your diet or supplementation regime,\ncan help you arrive at a salt intake\nthat's going to optimize your mental,\nphysical health, and performance,\nso we're going to cover neurobiology.\nWe're going to cover hormone biology.\nWe're going to talk about liver function.\nWe're going to talk about kidney function\nand, of course, brain function.\nI'm excited to share this\ninformation with you today.\nI'm certain you're going to come\naway with a lot of information\nand actionable items.\nI'm pleased to announce\nthat I'm hosting two live events this May.\nThe first live event will take place\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second live event will take place\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nPresale tickets for these\ntwo events are now available\nat hubermanlab.com/tour.\nI should mention that\nwhile I do hope to visit other\ncities in the near future\nto do more live events,\nright now,\nthese are the only two live\nevents I have scheduled,\nat least for the six months,\nso once again, if you go\nto hubermanlab.com/tour,\nyou can access the presale tickets.\nI hope to see you at these live events,\nand as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\nBefore we dive into the\ntopic of today's episode,\nI want to highlight a\nreally exciting new study.\nThis is a study from Diego Bohorquez' lab\nat Duke University.\nThe Bohorquez Lab studies interactions\nbetween the gut and the brain\nand has made some incredible discoveries\nof the so-called neuropod cells.\nNeuropod cells are neurons, nerve cells,\nthat reside in our gut\nand that detect things like\nfatty acids, amino acids,\nand some neuropod cells sense sugar.\nPrevious work from this\nlaboratory has shown\nthat when we ingest sugar,\nthese neuropod cells respond to that sugar\nand send electrical signals\nup a little wire that we call an axon\nthrough the vagus nerve, for\nthose of you that want to know,\nand into the brain,\nand through subsequent\nstations of neural processing,\nevoke the release of dopamine.\nDopamine is a molecule\nknown to promote craving\nand motivation and indeed action,\nand what these neuropod\ncells that send sugar\nare thought to do is to promote\nseeking and consumption,\neating of more sugary foods.\nNow, the incredible thing is\nthat it's all subconscious.\nThis is a taste system in the gut\nthat is not available to\nyour conscious awareness.\nNow, of course, when\nyou ingest sweet foods,\nyou taste them on your mouth too,\nand so part of the reason\nthat you crave sweet foods, perhaps,\nis because they taste good to you,\nand the other reason\nis that these neuropod cells\nare driving a chemical craving\nbelow your conscious detection,\nso they're really two systems.\nYour gut is sensing, at a\nsubconscious level, what's in it\nand sending signals to your\nbrain that work in concert,\nin parallel with the signals\ncoming from your mouth\nand your experience of\nthe taste of the food.\nNow, that alone is incredible,\nand it's been the subject of\nmany important landmark papers\nover the last decade or so.\nYou can imagine how this\nsystem would be very important\nfor things like hidden sugars\nwhen nowadays, in a\nlot of processed foods,\nthey're putting hidden sugars.\nThey're putting a lot of things\nthat cause your gut to\nsend signals to your brain\nthat make you crave more of those foods,\nso for those of you\nthat really love sugar,\njust understand it's not just\nabout how that sugar tastes.\nThe new study from the Bohorquez Lab\ndeserves attention, I believe.\nThis is a paper published just recently,\nFebruary 25th this year, 2022,\nin \"Nature Neuroscience,\"\nan excellent journal,\nand the title of the paper is\n\"The Preference for Sugar over Sweetener\n\"Depends on a Gut Sensor Cell.\"\nThe Bohorquez Lab has now\ndiscovered a neuropod cell,\nmeaning a category of neurons,\nthat can distinguish between\nsweet things in the gut\nthat contain calories,\nfor instance, sugar,\nand things in the gut that are sweet\nbut do not contain calories:\nartificial sweeteners\nlike aspartame, sucralose,\nand so forth.\nThere are also, of course,\nnonartificial, noncaloric sweeteners\nlike stevia, monk fruit, et cetera.\nThey did not explore\nthe full gallery of artificial sweeteners.\nWhat they did find,\nhowever, ought to pertain\nto all forms of sweet,\nnoncaloric substances.\nWhat they discovered\nwas that there is a\nsignature pattern of signals\nsent from the gut to the brain\nwhen we ingest artificial\nor noncaloric sweeteners.\nThis is important\nbecause what it says is that\nat a subconscious level,\nthe gut can distinguish\nbetween sweet things that contain calories\nand sweet things that do not.\nNow, what the downstream\nconsequences of this sensing is\nor what they are isn't yet clear.\nNow, I believe everyone\nshould be aware of these kinds of studies\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all,\nit's important to understand\nthat what you crave,\nmeaning the foods you crave\nand the drinks you crave,\nis, in part, due to your\nconscious experience\nof the taste of those things,\nbut also due to biochemical\nand neural events\nthat start in the body\nand impinge on your brain\nand cause you to seek out certain things\neven though you might not know\nwhy you're seeking out more sugar.\nYou find that you're\ncraving a lot of sugar,\nor you're craving a lot of foods\nwith artificial sweeteners,\nand you don't necessarily know why.\nNow, artificial sweeteners themselves\nare a somewhat controversial topic.\nI want to highlight that.\nSome months back, I described\na study from Yale University\nabout how one can condition\nthe insulin system.\nInsulin is involved in\nmobilizing of blood sugar\nand so forth in the body,\nas many of you know,\nand I described some studies\nthat were done from Yale\nUniversity School of Medicine\nlooking at how artificial sweeteners\ncan actually evoke an insulin response\nunder certain conditions.\nNow, a couple of key things.\nI got a little bit of pushback\nafter covering those studies,\nand I encourage pushback all the time.\nPushback is one of those things\nthat forces all of us to\ndrill deeper into a topic.\nI want to be clear.\nFirst of all,\nI am not one to demonize\nartificial sweeteners.\nThere is evidence, in animal models,\nin animal models,\nthat artificial sweeteners can\ndisrupt the gut microbiome,\nbut those were fairly high\ndoses of artificial sweeteners,\nand it's unclear if the same\nthing pertains to humans,\nstill unclear, I should say,\nhas not been investigated thoroughly.\nSome people don't like the\ntaste of artificial sweeteners.\nSome people do.\nSome people find\nthat they really help them\navoid excessive caloric intake.\nSome people believe,\nand yet I should emphasize\nthere still isn't evidence\nthat they can adjust the\ninsulin response in all people.\nI just want to repeat that three times\nso that people are clear on that fact.\nWhat these new data emphasize, however,\nis that we need to understand\nhow artificial sweeteners are consumed\nat the level of the gut,\nor I should say registered\nat the level of the gut\nand how that changes brain function\nbecause one thing that I'm familiar with\nand that many people report\nis that when they first\ntaste artificial sweeteners,\nthey taste sort of not right to them.\nThey don't like the taste,\nbut over time, they actually\nstart to crave that taste.\nI've experienced this.\nI used to drink a lot of diet sodas\nwhen I was in graduate school,\nso this would be aspartame,\nand I found that I would,\nI actually needed them.\nNow, maybe it was the caffeine.\nMaybe I just liked the sweet\ntaste or the carbonation.\nWe actually have a drive for carbonation,\nwhich is a topic of a future episode,\nbut when I finally quit them,\nfor reasons that were independent\nof any fear of artificial sweeteners,\nI found that I didn't like the taste.\nNowadays, I only occasionally\ndrink a diet soda.\nI usually do that if I'm on a plane\nand there's nothing else available to me,\nso I don't demonize them.\nI might drink one every once in a while.\nNo big deal.\nI also want to be clear I consume stevia\non a number of different supplements\nand foods that I consume.\nStevia, of course, is a\nplant-based noncaloric sweetener,\nso I, myself, consume\nartificial sweeteners.\nMany people hate them.\nMany people like them\nand find them useful for their nutrition,\nand in fact, to keep their caloric intake\nin a range that's right for them,\nand many people, like myself,\nare curious about them\nand somewhat wary of them\nand yet continue to consume\nthem in small amounts.\nI think most people probably\nfall into that category.\nI should also mention that\nmany food manufacturers\nput artificial sweeteners,\nsuch as sucralose, et cetera, into foods,\nand it's always been unclear\nas to why they might want to do that,\nand yet we know that the\nsweet taste consumption,\neven if it doesn't contain calories,\ncan drive more craving of sweet food,\nso there may be a logic or a\nstrategy to why they do that.\nAgain, a topic for\nexploration on today's podcast\nand in future podcasts\nbecause where we're headed today\nis a discussion about how\nsalt and salt sensing,\nboth consciously and unconsciously,\ncan adjust our craving for other things,\nlike sugar and water and so on,\nso I want to highlight this beautiful work\nfrom the Bohorquez Lab.\nWe'll put a link to the study.\nI want to open this as a\nchapter for further exploration.\nI like to think that the\nlisteners of this podcast\nare looking for answers\nwhere we have answers,\nbut are also, I would hope,\nexcited about some of the\nnew and emerging themes\nin what we call nutritional neurobiology,\nand indeed, the Bohorquez\nLab really stands\nas one of the premier\nlaboratories out there\nthat's looking at how foods,\nas consumed in the gut,\nare modifying our nervous system,\nthe foods we crave, and\nhow we utilize those foods.\nBefore where we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, now called AG1.\nI've been taking AG1 since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1\nand the reason I still take\nAG1 once or twice a day\nis that I find it to be the best way\nto ensure I get all of\nmy vitamins and minerals\nand the probiotics I need.\nI try and eat really well,\nbut I'm not perfect about it,\nand with Athletic Greens, AG1,\nI cover any deficiencies I might have.\nThe probiotics are\nparticularly important to me\nbecause, as we've talked about\non many previous episodes\nand we'll talk about\nmore on today's episode,\nthe gut microbiome is\nsupported by probiotics,\nand the gut microbiome supports\nmany biological functions\nimportant for immediate\nand long-term health,\nthings like immune system function,\nthings like the gut-brain axis\nand mood and appetite and so forth.\nWith Athletic Greens,\nI make sure all of those bases are covered\nbecause of the probiotics.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nand they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3+K2.\nVitamin D3 is crucial\nfor many aspects of our\nimmediate and long-term health,\nand many people simply are\nnot getting enough vitamin D3,\nor the amounts they're\ngetting are not optimal.\nK2 is important for cardiovascular health\nand for calcium regulation,\nso again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim the special offer,\nthe five free travel packs\nand a year's supply of vitamin D3+K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand none of the things you don't.\nThat means it has salt,\nmagnesium, and potassium,\nthe so-called electrolytes,\nwhich are critical for neuronal function\nand a lot of other biological functions.\nAs I mentioned on the podcast before,\nI'm a fan of salt.\nI believe in ingesting\nappropriate amounts of salt,\nand by appropriate, I mean,\ndepending on what your\nbackground blood pressure\nhappens to be,\nwhat your activity levels\nare, how much you sweat,\nwhat your cognitive and\nphysical demands are.\nToday, we're going to talk about\nhow to determine what those needs are.\nI'm always trying to stay\non top of my hydration,\nand as you'll also learn about today,\nsalt and water intake and\nhydration are intimately related.\nWith LMNT, I'm sure to get\nthe potassium, the sodium,\nand the magnesium that I need,\nand I do that in a great-tasting drink,\nand as I mentioned\nbefore, it has no sugar.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to drinklmnt.com,\nthat's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free LMNT sample pack.\nYou only cover the cost of shipping.\nOtherwise, it's completely free.\nAgain, that's drinklmnt.com/huberman\nto claim a free sample pack of LMNT.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI am a big fan of getting\nregular blood work done,\nand I've been trying to do it\nas much as I can afford for years.\nThe reason is that many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be discovered\nfrom a quality blood test.\nWith most blood tests\nand DNA tests, however,\nyou get information back,\nbut not a lot of information\nabout what to do with those numbers,\nso if something's in high or low range,\nyou might get one or two\ngeneric recommendations,\nthings that you could\neasily look up online,\nbut you're not going to get a\nlot of specific recommendations.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey give you a lot of\nspecific recommendations\nas to lifestyle factors,\nnutrition factors,\nsupplementation factors,\nthings you may want to add to your life\nor things you may want\nto delete from your life\nin order to bring the numbers\ninto the ranges that are best\nfor your immediate and long-term health.\nThere's simply no replacement\nfor these kinds of data,\nand your data are the most\nimportant data to you,\nand quality blood tests and DNA tests\nare the way to access them.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\ngo to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 20% off.\nOkay, let's talk about salt.\nSalt has many, many important functions\nin the brain and body.\nFor instance, it regulates fluid balance,\nhow much fluid you desire and\nhow much fluid you excrete.\nIt also regulates your\ndesire for salt itself,\nmeaning your salt appetite.\nYou have a homeostatically\ndriven salt appetite.\nI'll talk about the mechanisms today,\nmake them all very clear.\nWhat that means is that\nyou crave salty things,\nbeverages and foods,\nwhen your salt stores are low,\nand you tend to avoid\nsalty beverages and foods\nwhen your salt stores are high,\nalthough that's not always the case.\nThere are circumstances where\nyou'll continue to crave salt\neven though you don't need salt\nor indeed even if you\nneed to eliminate salt\nfrom your system.\nSalt also regulates your\nappetite for other nutrients,\nthings like sugar, things\nlike carbohydrates,\nand today, we'll explore all of that.\nTechnically, salt is a mineral,\nand I should mention that when I say salt,\nI am indeed referring to\nsodium, in most cases,\nalthough I will be clear to\ndistinguish salt from sodium,\nmeaning table salt from sodium.\nMost people don't realize this,\nbut one gram of table salt\ncontains about 388 milligrams of sodium,\nso technically, we should be\ntalking about sodium today\nand not salt.\nI will use them interchangeably\nunless I'm referring to some\nspecific recommendations\nor ideas about trying to\ndefine your ideal salt,\naka sodium intake, okay?\nSo this is important.\nI think, right off the bat,\na lot of people get themselves\ninto a place of confusion\nand potentially even to a place of trouble\nby thinking that table salt in grams\nalways equates to sodium in grams,\nand that's simply not the case.\nToday, we're going to\nexplore the neural mechanisms\nby which we regulate our salt appetite\nand the way that the\nbrain and body interact\nin the context of\nsalt-seeking, salt avoidance,\nhow to determine when we need more salt,\nwhen we need less salt.\nWe'll talk about kidney function.\nWe'll get into all of it,\nand we're going to do\nit very systematically,\nso let's start in the brain.\nWe all harbor small sets of neurons.\nWe call these sets of neurons nuclei,\nmeaning little clusters of neurons,\nthat sense the levels of\nsalt in our brain and body.\nThere are couple brain\nregions that do this,\nand these brain regions\nare very, very special,\nspecial because they lack\nbiological fences around them\nthat other brain areas have,\nand those fences, or I\nshould say that fence,\ngoes by a particular name,\nand that name is the\nblood-brain barrier, or BBB.\nMost substances that are\ncirculating around in your body\ndo not have access to the brain,\nin particular, large molecules\ncan't just pass into the brain.\nThe brain is a privileged\norgan in this sense.\nThere are couple other\norgans that are privileged\nand that have very strict barriers,\nvery particular fences, if you will,\nand those other organs\ninclude things like\nthe ovaries and testes,\nand that makes sense for\nthe following reason:\nFirst of all, the brain,\nat least most of the brain,\ncannot regenerate after injury.\nYou just simply can't replace\nbrain cells after injury.\nI know people get really\nexcited about neurogenesis,\nthe birth of new neurons,\nand indeed, neurogenesis\nhas been demonstrated\nin animal models,\nand to some extent it exists\nin humans in a few places,\nfor instance, the olfactory bulb,\nwhere neurons are responsible\nfor detecting odorants in the environment,\nfor smell, that is,\nand in a little subregion of\nthe hippocampus, a memory area,\nthere's probably some neurogenesis,\nbut the bulk of really good data out there\npoint to the fact that in humans\nthere's not much turnover of neurons.\nWhat that means is that the\nneurons you're born with\nare the ones that you're going to be using\nmost, if not all, of your life.\nIn fact, you're born\nwith many more neurons\nthan you'll have later,\nand there's a process of\nnaturally occurring cell death\ncalled apoptosis, that\noccurs during development,\nso you actually are born\nwith many more neurons\nthan you have later in life,\nand that's the reflection\nof a normal, healthy process\nof nerve cell elimination,\nso the estimates vary,\nbut anywhere from 1/3 to maybe even 1/2\nor even 2/3 of neurons,\ndepending on the brain area,\nare just going to die across development.\nThat might sound terrible,\nbut that's actually one of the ways\nin which you go from being kind\nof like a little potato bug\nflopping around helplessly in your crib\nto being an organism\nthat can walk and talk\nand articulate and calculate math\nor do whatever it is\nthat you do for a living,\nso the brain has a set of elements,\nthese nerve cells and other cells,\nand it needs to use those\nfor the entire lifespan,\nso having a BBB, a blood-brain\nbarrier around the brain,\nis absolutely critical.\nThe ovaries and testes have\na barrier for, we assume,\nthe reason that they\ncontain the genetic material\nby which we can pass on\nour genes to our offspring,\nprogeny, meaning make children,\nand those children will have our genes,\nor at least half of them,\nthe other half from\nthe partner, of course.\nIf the cells within the\novaries and testes are mutated,\nwell, then, you can get\nmutations in offspring,\nso that's very costly in\nthe evolutionary sense,\nso it makes sense\nthat you would have a\nbarrier from the blood\nso if you ingest what's called a mutagen,\nif you ingest something that\ncan mutate the genes of cells,\nyou can imagine why\nthere would be a premium\non not allowing those mutagens\nto get into the brain, the\novaries, or the testes, okay?\nSo the brain has this BBB,\nthis blood-brain barrier around it,\nwhich makes it very, very hard\nfor substances to pass into the brain\nunless those substances are very small\nor those substances and molecules\nare critically required\nfor brain function.\nHowever, there are a couple\nof regions in the brain\nthat have a fence around them,\nbut that fence is weaker, okay?\nIt's sort of like going\nfrom a really big wall\nthick electronic 24-hour\nsurveillance fence\nwhere nothing can pass through\nexcept only the exclusive cargo\nthat's allowed to go through\nto having a little cyclone\nfence with a couple holes in it,\nor it's a kind of a picket\nfence that's falling over,\nand substances can move freely in\nfrom the blood circulating\nin the body into the brain,\nand it turns out that\nthe areas of the brain\nthat monitor salt balance\nand other features of\nwhat's happening in the body\nat the level of what we call osmolarity,\nat the concentration of salt,\nreside in these little sets of neurons\nthat sit just on the other\nside of these weak fences,\nand the most important\nand famous of these,\nfor sake of today's\nconversation, is one called OVLT.\nOVLT stands for\nthe organum vasculosum of\nthe lateral terminalis.\nIt is what's called a\ncircumventricular organ.\nWhy circumventricular?\nWell, not to bog you\ndown with neuroanatomy,\nbut your brain is a big squishy mass\nof neurons and other cell types,\nbut it has to be nourished,\nand through the middle of that brain,\nthere is a tube, there's a\nhollow, that creates spaces,\nand those spaces are called ventricles.\nThe ventricles are spaces\nin which cerebrospinal fluid circulates,\nand it nourishes the brain.\nIt does a number of other things as well.\nThe circumventricular organs\nare areas of the brain that are\nnear that circulating fluid,\nand that circulating fluid\nhas access to the bloodstream,\nand the bloodstream has access to it,\nand this structure that I'm referring to,\nOVLT, organum vasculosum\nof the lateral terminalis,\nhas neurons that can sense\nthe contents of the blood\nand, to some extent,\nthe cerebrospinal fluid.\nThere are couple other brain\nareas that can do this as well.\nThey go also by the name of\ncircumventricular organs,\nand I'll talk about the names\nof some of those other areas,\nbut for today,\nand I think for sake of\nmost of the discussion,\nunderstand that the OVLT is special.\nWhy?\nBecause it doesn't have\nthis thick barrier fence,\nwhich sounds like a bad thing,\nand yet it's a terrific border detector.\nThe neurons in that region\nare able to pay attention\nto what's passing through\nin the bloodstream\nand can detect, for instance,\nif the levels of sodium in\nthe bloodstream are too low,\nif the level of blood pressure in the body\nis too low or too high,\nand then, the OVLT can send\nsignals to other brain areas,\nand then, those other\nbrain areas can do things\nlike release hormones that\ncan go and act on tissues\nin what we call the\nperiphery, in the body,\nand, for instance, have the\nkidneys secrete more urine\nto get rid of salt that's\nexcessive salt in the body\nor have the kidneys hold onto urine,\nto hold onto whatever water\nor fluid that one might need,\nso before I go any\ndeeper into this pathway,\njust understand that the OVLT\nhas a very limited barrier.\nIt can detect things in the bloodstream,\nand this incredible area of the brain,\nalmost single-handedly,\nsets off the cascades of things\nthat allow you to regulate\nyour salt balance,\nwhich turns out to be absolutely critical,\nnot just for your ability to think\nand for your neurons to work,\nbut indeed, for all of life.\nIf the OVLT doesn't function correctly,\nyou're effectively dead or dead soon,\nso this is a very important brain region,\nso let's talk about the\nfunction of the OVLT\nand flesh out some of the\nother aspects of its circuitry,\nof its communication\nwith other brain areas\nand with the body\nin the context of something\nthat we are all familiar with,\nwhich is thirst.\nHave you ever wondered\njust why you get thirsty?\nWell, it's because neurons in your OVLT\nare detecting changes in your bloodstream,\nwhich detect global\nchanges within your body,\nand in response to that,\nyour OVLT sets off certain\nevents within your brain and body\nthat make you either\nwant to drink more fluid\nor to stop drinking fluid.\nThere are two main kinds of thirst.\nThe first one is called osmotic thirst,\nand the second is called\nhypovolemic thirst.\nOsmotic thirst has to do\nwith the concentration of\nsalt in your bloodstream,\nso let's say you ingest\nsomething very, very salty.\nLet's say you ingest a big bag of,\nI confess I don't eat these very often,\nbut I really like those\nkettle potato chips,\nand they're pretty salty.\nI've never actually measured\nhow much sodium is in them.\nI'm sure the information is there.\nEvery once in a while,\nI'm particularly interested in doing so,\nI'll just down a bag of those things,\nand I really like them,\nand they're very salty,\nbut they almost always\nmake me feel thirsty,\nand the reason is that by eating those,\nI've ingested a lot of sodium.\nAgain, not a frequent occurrence for me,\nbut happens every now and again,\nand I don't have too much shame about that\nbecause I think I have a pretty\nhealthy relationship to food\nand I enjoy them,\nand I understand\nthat it will drive salt\nlevels up in my bloodstream,\nand that will cause me\nto be thirsty, but why?\nWhy?\nBecause neurons in the OVLT\ncome in two main varieties.\nOne variety senses the\nosmolarity of the blood\nthat's getting across\nthat weak little fence\nthat we talked about before,\nand when the osmolarity,\nmeaning the salt concentration\nof the blood, is high,\nit activates these specific\nneurons in the OVLT,\nand by activates,\nI mean it causes them to\nsend electrical potentials,\nliterally, send electrical\nsignals to other brain areas,\nand those other brain areas\ninspire a number of\ndifferent downstream events,\nso what are those other brain areas?\nWell, the OVLT\nsignals to an area called\nthe supraoptic nucleus.\nThe name and why it's called\nthe supraoptic nucleus\nis not necessarily important.\nIt also signals to the so-called\nparaventricular nucleus,\nanother nucleus that\nsits near the ventricles\nand can monitor the qualities,\nthe chemical qualities of\nthe cerebrospinal fluid\nas well as, probably,\nthe bloodstream as well,\nand the consequence\nof that communication\nis that a particular hormone\nis eventually released\nfrom the posterior pituitary.\nNow, the pituitary is a gland\nthat sits near the roof of your mouth.\nIt releases all sorts of things\nlike growth hormone and\nluteinizing hormone.\nLuteinizing hormone will stimulate things\nlike estrogen and testosterone\nproduction and release\nfrom the ovaries and testes and so on.\nThe pituitary has a bunch\nof different compartments and functions,\nbut what's really cool about the pituitary\nis that certain regions of the pituitary\nactually contain the axons,\nthe wires of neurons,\nand the neurons reside in the brain,\nand so the supraoptic nucleus\ngets a signal from the OVLT.\nThe signal is purely in the\nform of electrical activity.\nRemember, neurons aren't\ntalking in one another\nabout what's happening out there.\nThey're not saying, \"Psst!\n\"Hey, there's too much\nsalt in the bloodstream.\n\"Let's do something about it.\"\nAll they receive are\nso-called action potential,\nwaves of electricity.\nThe neurons in the supraoptic nucleus\nthen release their own electrical signals\nwithin the pituitary,\nand some of those neurons\nand nearby neurons\nare capable of releasing hormones\nas well as electrical signals,\nso from the pituitary,\nthere's a hormonal signal that's released\ncalled vasopressin.\nVasopressin also goes by the\nname antidiuretic hormone,\nand antidiuretic hormone has the capacity\nto either restrict the amount\nof urine that we secrete,\nor, when that system is turned off,\nto increase the amount\nof urine that we secrete,\nso there's a complicated set\nof cascades that's evoked\nby having high salt\nconcentration in the blood.\nThere's also a complicated set\nof cascades that are evoked\nby having low concentrations\nof sodium in the blood,\nbut the pathway is nonetheless the same.\nIt's OVLT is detecting\nthose osmolarity changes,\ncommunicating to the supraoptic nucleus.\nSupraoptic nucleus is either\ncausing the release of\nor is releasing vasopressin,\nantidiuretic hormone,\nor that system is shut off\nso that the antidiuretic\nhormone is not secreted,\nwhich would allow urine to\nflow more freely, right?\nAntidiuretic means anti release of urine,\nand by shutting that off,\nyou are going to cause\nthe release of urine.\nYou're sort of allowing a\nsystem to flow, so to speak.\nThe second category of\nthirst is hypovolemic thirst.\nHypovolemic thirst occurs\nwhen there's a drop in\nblood pressure, okay?\nSo the OVLT, as I mentioned before,\ncan sense osmolarity\nbased on the fact that\nit has these neurons\nthat can detect how much\nsalt is in the bloodstream,\nbut the OVLT also harbors neurons\nthat are of the baroreceptor,\nmechanoreceptor category.\nNow, more on baroreceptors\nand mechanoreceptors later,\nbut baroreceptors are\nessentially a receptor,\nmeaning a protein that's in a cell\nthat responds to changes\nin blood pressure,\nso there are a number of things\nthat can cause decreases\nin blood pressure.\nSome of those include, for instance,\nif you lose a lot of blood, right?\nIf you're bleeding quite a lot,\nor in some cases, if\nyou vomit quite a lot,\nor if you have extensive diarrhea\nor any combination of those,\nand there are other things\nthat can reduce blood volume,\nand we will talk about\nsome of those later,\nbut in the classic case\nof hypovolemic thirst,\none is simply losing blood,\nand therefore, blood pressure goes down,\nso very simple to imagine in your mind.\nYou have these pipes,\nwhich are the arteries,\nveins, and capillaries,\nand when you lose some blood volume,\nthe pressure in those arteries,\nveins, and capillaries\ngoes down.\nOVLT has neurons\nthat can sense that\nreduction in blood pressure\nbecause of the presence\nof baroreceptors in OVLT.\nThere are other elements\nthat also play into the response\nto what we call hypovolemic thirst.\nFor instance,\nthe kidney will secrete\nsomething called renin.\nRenin will activate something\ncalled angiotensin II\nfrom the lungs, of all things, amazing,\nand angiotensin II itself can act on OVLT,\norganum vasculosum of\nthe lateral terminalis,\nwhich, in turn, will create thirst, okay?\nSo in both cases, right?\nThe osmolarity sensing system,\nmeaning osmotic thirst,\nand in hypovolemic thirst, where\nblood pressure has dropped,\nthe end result is a desire to drink more,\nand that desire to drink more\ncomes through a variety of pathways\nthat are both direct and indirect,\ninclude vasopressin and\ndon't include vasopressin,\nbut I think, for just\nsake of general example,\nand even for those of you\nthat don't have any biology background\nor physiology background,\njust understand that there\nare two main types of thirst.\nBoth types of thirst, osmotic\nthirst and hypovolemic thirst,\nare not just about seeking water,\nbut they also are about seeking salt.\nIn very general terms,\nsalt, aka sodium, can help retain water.\nNow, that doesn't mean that\nsalt always retains water.\nIf you have excessive amounts of salt,\nwill you retain excessive\namounts of water?\nWell, sort of.\nAs we'll soon learn, it's all contextual,\nbut for most cases,\nwe can say that by having\nsalt in our system,\nour brain and our body\ncan function normally\nprovided the levels of salt are adequate\nand not too high or too low,\nand thirst, while we often think of it\nas just a way to bring\nfluid into our body,\nis designed as a kind of\na interoceptive perception.\nWhat I mean by that,\ninteroception, as many of know now\nfrom listening to this podcast,\nis a paying of attention\nor a recognition, rather,\na conscious recognition\nof the events going on within our body,\nso when we are thirsty,\nit's a certain form of interoception.\nWe go, \"Oh, I need something\nor I crave something.\"\nYou may not know exactly what you need,\nbut when you are thirsty,\nyou're not just seeking water;\nyou're also seeking to\nbalance your osmolarity,\nwhich means you may be\nseeking salty fluids\nor foods, in some cases.\nYou'll try and accomplish this by eating,\nor it may be that you're trying to avoid,\nor you will be inspired to\navoid salty fluids and foods,\nbut if you want to understand sodium\nand its roles in the body,\nyou have to understand thirst,\nand if you want to understand thirst,\nyou have to understand how fluid balance\nis regulated in the body.\nThat's not surprising at all,\nbut sodium and water work together\nin order to generate what we call thirst.\nSodium water work together in\norder to either retain water\nor inspire us to let go\nof water, to urinate,\nso before we can dive into\nthe specifics around salt\nand how to use salt for performance\nand various recommendations\nand things to avoid,\nwe need to drill a little bit deeper\ninto this fluid balance\nmechanism in the body,\nand for that reason,\nwe have to pay at least\na little bit of attention\nto the kidney.\nThe kidney is an incredible organ,\nand one of the reasons\nthe kidney is so amazing\nis that it's responsible for\nboth retaining, holding onto,\nor allowing the release of\nvarious substances from the body,\nsubstances like glucose or amino acids,\nurea, uric acid,\nsalt, potassium, magnesium.\nIt's basically a filter,\nbut it's a very, very intelligent filter.\nI mean, intelligent meaning\nit doesn't have its own mind,\nbut the way it works is really beautiful.\nBasically, blood enters the kidney\nand it goes through a series of tubes\nwhich are arranged into loops.\nIf you want to look more into this,\nthere's the beautiful Loop of Henle\nand other aspects of the kidney design\nthat allow certain\nsubstances to be retained\nand other substances to be released,\ndepending on how concentrated\nthose substances are\nin the blood.\nThe kidney responds to a\nnumber of hormonal signals,\nincluding vasopressin,\nin order to, for instance,\nantidiuretic hormone,\nin order to hold onto more fluid\nif that's what your brain and body need,\nand it responds to other\nhormonal signals as well,\nso it's a pretty complex organ.\nNonetheless, there's a key\npoint, which I already mentioned,\nthat I think most people don't realize.\nThis is actually something\nthat I like to tell kids when I meet them,\nprovided that they're of appropriate age.\nI'll say, oftentimes, with kids\nlearn that I'm a scientist,\nthey'll ask a question about\nsomething related to science,\nand hopefully, for my sake,\nit's something about neuroscience,\nbut one thing that I'll tell kids,\nI'll say, \"Do you know\nthat your urine, your pee,\n\"is actually filtered blood?\"\nAnd occasionally, that\nwill really terrify a kid,\nbut that also occasionally\nreally terrifies an adult,\nbut indeed, your urine is filtered blood.\nBasically, blood gets into the kidney.\nThe kidney's going to\nfilter out certain things.\nCertain things are going to\nbe allowed to pass through\nand others are not, okay?\nSo the way the kidney is designed is that\nabout 90% of the stuff that's\nabsorbed from the blood\nis going to be absorbed early\nin this series of tubes,\nand only a small percentage\nis going to be regulated or worked out\nas you get into what's\ncalled the distal kidney.\nI mean, distal just means\nthe furthest part away, okay?\nThe proximal is up close,\nso like your shoulder\nis proximal to your midline of your body,\nand your hand is distal,\nso in biological terms,\nyou hear about proximal, distal,\nwhich just means near or far from,\nso just to give a really simple example,\nlet's say that you are very low on fluid.\nYou haven't had much to drink in a while.\nMaybe you're walking around on a hot day.\nChances are that the neurons in your OVLT\nwill sense the increase\nin osmolarity, right?\nThe concentration of salt\nis going to be increased\nrelative to the fluid\nvolume that's circulating.\nThis, of course, assumes\nthat you haven't excreted a lot of sodium\nfor one reason or another,\nbut that increase in osmolarity\nis detected by the OVLT.\nThe OVLT is going to signal\na bunch of different cascades\nthrough the supraoptic nucleus, et cetera,\nand then, vasopressin\nis going to be released\ninto the bloodstream,\nand vasopressin, again, also\ncalled antidiuretic hormone,\nis going to act on the kidney\nand change the kidney's function\nin a couple of different ways,\nsome mechanical, some chemical, okay?\nIn order to make sure that your kidney\ndoes not release much water,\ndoesn't make you want to urinate,\nand in fact, even if you\nwould try to urinate,\nyour body's going to tend to\nhold onto its fluid stores.\nSo very simple, straightforward example.\nWe can also give the other example\nwhereby if you are ingesting\na lot, a lot, a lot of water,\nand it's not a particularly hot day,\nand you're not sweating very much,\nlet's assume your salt intake is constant\nor is low for whatever reason,\nwell, then, the osmolarity,\nthe salt concentration in your blood,\nis going to be lower.\nYour OVLT will detect that\nbecause of these osmosensing\nneurons in your OVLT.\nYour OVLT will fail to signal\nto the supraoptic nucleus,\nand there will not be the release\nof vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,\nand you can excrete all the water\nthat your body wants to excrete,\nmeaning you'll be able to urinate.\nThere's no holding onto water\nat the level of the kidney, okay?\nVery simple examples,\nbut hopefully, it illustrates\nhow events within the blood,\nmeaning the concentration of salt\nrelative to the amount of fluid, right?\nThat's what osmolarity is,\nis detected by the OVLT.\nThe brain then communicates\nto the pituitary.\nThe pituitary sends a\nhormone out into the blood,\nand the hormone acts on the kidney\nto either hold onto or let go of fluid,\nmeaning to prevent you\nfrom wanting to urinate\nor from stimulating\nyou to want to urinate.\nVery, very simple kind of\nyes/no-type situation here.\nThere's a lot of nuance\nto this in reality.\nThere are a lot of other\nhormones in this pathway,\nbut I think, for at least\nthis stage of the discussion,\nthis should be sufficient.\nSome of you may have noticed\nthat a molecule we've been\ntalking a lot about today,\nvasopressin, was also mentioned\non a previous episode of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut in a very different context.\nThe molecule I'm referring\nto is vasopressin,\nand, as I mentioned,\nit's a hormone involved in antidiuresis,\nmeaning preventing urination.\nIt's an antidiuretic,\nbut we also talked about vasopressin\nin the context of desire,\nlove, and attachment.\nWe talked about it\nin the context of monogamy and nonmonogamy\nin a species of animal\ncalled the prairie vole.\nYou can check out that episode.\nI believe vasopressin in the\nnonmonogamous prairie voles\nare mentioned in the timestamp,\nso it should be easy to find.\nVasopressin is made\nat multiple locations\nin the nervous system,\nmainly the supraoptic nucleus,\nand indeed, it's also involved\nin aspects of sexual behavior and mating.\nNow, it does that through mechanisms\nthat are distinct from\nits antidiuretic effects.\nIn fact, there are people\nwho take vasopressin as an aphrodisiac.\nNow, I'm certainly not\nsuggesting people do that,\nbut I have all the confidence in the world\nthat the moment I talk about vasopressin,\nsomeone in the comments is going to say,\n\"What do you think about\nvasopressin nasal sprays\n\"and this kind of thing?\"\nVasopressin, and indeed oxytocin,\nanother hormone that's\ninvolved in pair bonding\nand various aspects of\nbrain and body function,\nare available as nasal sprays\nthat can get up into the\ndeep recesses of the brain\nand can impact some of these core\nwhat we call hypothalamic functions,\nthese primitive drives and\nhypothalamic functions.\nI would encourage a lot of caution,\nmaybe even extreme caution\nin recreational use\nof things like vasopressin and oxytocin\nunless you are working with MD,\nan MD, excuse me,\nand they prescribe it\nor they really know what they're doing.\nThese are powerful hormones\nthat have a lot of different\neffects on the brain and body.\nThe way that vasopressin,\nmeaning antidiuretic hormone,\nprevents the release of\nfluid as urine from the body\nis pretty interesting.\nIt acts directly on the kidney,\nso, as I mentioned before,\nblood flows into the kidney.\nA number of things are retained\nin the early part of the kidney.\nVasopressin acts at a fairly distal,\nmeaning kind of end game part\nof the loops of tubes through the kidney,\nand it increases the\npermeability of those tubes.\nIn other words, it makes\nsure that the fluid\nthat would otherwise pass\ninto a collecting duct\nand then go out to the bladder\nnever actually makes it to the bladder.\nI point this out because what\nantidiuretic hormone does is\nit prevents the bladder\nfrom filling at all.\nIt's not as if it locks\nfluid in the bladder\nand prevents you from urinating.\nI think the way I've been\ndescribing things up until now\nand the way you'll hear\nabout antidiuretic hormone,\nit might sound like it kind\nof locks up the bladder\nor prevents you from\nbeing able to urinate,\nbut you have a full bladder.\nThat would be very uncomfortable.\nThat's not the way it works.\nIt actually causes the tubes\nheaded towards the bladder from the kidney\nto become permeable,\nmeaning to allow fluid to go\nback into the bloodstream,\ninto the rest of the body,\nso that fluid never\nactually fills the bladder,\nand so you never feel the urge to urinate.\nNow, this is an episode about salt.\nA key thing to understand about the kidney\nis that the kidney uses sodium\nin order to conserve water,\nwhich has everything to do with the fact\nthat sodium can actually hold water.\nPut differently, water\ntends to follow sodium,\nso where we have sodium,\nwe tend to have water,\nand sodium, when it's concentrated,\ncan hold onto water,\nand that's one of the main ways\nthat the kidney holds\nonto water in the body,\nand as we'll soon learn,\nthere is no simple and direct\nformula to say, for instance,\n\"Okay, if salt levels are high,\na lot of water is retained,\n\"and if salt levels are low,\na lot of water is released.\"\nOn the one hand, that can be true,\nbut it's also the case\nbecause these systems are homeostatic,\nmeaning they're always seeking balance,\nboth within system,\nwithin the salt system,\nand between systems, the\nsalt and water system.\nIt's also the case, often,\nthat if we have enough sodium,\nwell, then we can secrete sodium\nand some water will follow,\nor if we don't have enough\nsodium, then, yes, indeed\nbecause we're not holding onto water,\nmore fluid can be excreted,\nbut if that condition of low\nsodium lasts long enough,\nthen we start to retain water\nbecause the body recognizes,\n\"Ah, salt is low, and\nwater is being excreted,\"\nand eventually, a system\nwill kick in to retain water,\nso I'd love to give you\na simple black-and-white, yes-or-no answer\nfor low sodium, high sodium,\nmoderate sodium, and water balance,\nbut it's all contextual,\nand when I say contextual,\nI mean, it will depend on\nblood pressure, hypertension,\nprehypertension, if that's there,\nmaybe normal tension, hormone levels,\nexercise, et cetera, et cetera.\nA pretty good example of how\ncomplicated this can all be\nis one that some of you\nmay be familiar with.\nIt's pretty well known\nthat during certain phases\nof the menstrual cycle,\nwhen estrogen and progesterone\nand other hormones are fluctuating,\nthat water can be retained in the body.\nIt's what's called edema,\nor a swelling, sometimes,\nso the common assumption,\nand indeed, it can be true,\nthat when estrogen levels are high,\nthere's water retention in the body.\nAlso, in males, if\nestrogen levels are high,\nthere can be water retention in the body.\nThis is one of the reasons why athletes\nand, in particular, bodybuilders\nwho take anabolic steroids\nlike testosterone,\nwhich can be converted into estrogens,\nsometimes they'll look,\nthey'll walk around,\nthey look like they\nwere partially inflated.\nThey look like they're going to pop,\nand it looks like a swelling of the skin,\nnot just because they have large muscles,\nand that's not always,\nbut often, water retention\ndue to testosterone\nconversion into estrogen.\nNow, that all sounds consistent, right?\nEstrogen levels fluctuate\nin the menstrual cycle.\nIn males, where there's\nan increase in estrogen,\nthere's retention of water,\nbut actually, estrogen acts as a diuretic,\nso one would think, \"Okay,\nwhen estrogen levels go up,\n\"there should be a lot of fluid excreted,\"\nbut I bring up this example to point out\nthat it's a very complicated\nand dynamic balance\nbetween hormones and salt and fluid.\nYou can't draw a one-to-one\nrelationship there,\nand that turns out to be\na very important point,\nand we can use that,\nnot as a way to further complicate things,\nbut as a way to understand\nunder which contexts\nless sodium intake or more\nsodium intake can be beneficial,\nso that's where I'd like\nto turn our attention now,\nso how much salt do we need?\nAnd what can we trust\nin terms of trying to guide\nour ingestion of salt?\nFirst of all, I want\nto be very, very clear\nthat there are a number\nof people out there\nthat have prehypertension or hypertension.\nYou need to know\nif you have prehypertension\nor hypertension.\nYou need to know if you\nhave normal tension,\nmeaning normal blood pressure.\nEveryone should know their blood pressure.\nIt's a absolutely crucial measurement\nthat has a lot of impact\non your immediate and\nlong-term health outcomes.\nIt informs a lot about what you should do.\nShould you be doing more\ncardiovascular exercise?\nShould you be ingesting more or less salt?\nShould you be adjusting\nany number of different lifestyle factors?\nSo you need to know that,\nand without knowing what\nyour blood pressure is,\nI can't give a one-size-fits-all\nrecommendation,\nand indeed, I'm not going to\ngive medical recommendations.\nI'm simply going to spell out\nwhat I know about the research,\nwhich, hopefully, will\npoint you in the direction\nof figuring out what's right for you\nin terms of salt and indeed fluid intake.\nThere is a school of thought\nthat everybody is consuming too much salt,\nand I do want to highlight the fact\nthat there are dozens, if not\nhundreds, of quality papers\nthat point to the fact that a,\nquote-unquote, high salt diet\ncan be bad for various organs\nand tissues in the body,\nincluding the brain.\nIt just so happens that\nbecause fluid balance,\nboth inside and outside of cells,\nis crucial, not just for\nyour heart and for your lungs\nand for your liver and for\nall the organs of your body,\nbut also for your brain,\nthat if the salt concentration\ninside of cells in your brain\nbecomes too high, neurons suffer, right?\nThey will draw fluid into those cells\nbecause water tends to follow\nsalt, as I mentioned before,\nand those cells can swell.\nYou can literally get\nswelling of brain tissue.\nConversely, if salt levels are too low\ninside of cells in any tissue of the body,\nbut in the brain included,\nthen the cells of the\nbody and brain can shrink\nbecause water is pulled into\nthe extracellular space,\naway from cells,\nand indeed, under those conditions,\nbrain function can suffer,\nand indeed, the overall health\nof the brain can suffer,\nso there are many reports out there\nindicating, both in experimental models\nand, to some extent, in humans,\nthat overconsumption of salt\nis bad for brain function and longevity,\nand yet there is also decent evidence,\nin both animal models and humans,\nthat if salt consumption is too low,\nthen brain health and\nlongevity will suffer,\nas will other organs\nand tissues of the body,\nso, like most things in biology,\nyou don't want things too high or too low.\nNow, I would say that the vast\nmajority of studies out there\npoint to the fact that a high-salt diet\nis detrimental to brain\nhealth and function.\nMost of the studies have\nfocused on that aspect\nof salt balance and its\nconsequences on brain function.\nOne critical issue with many\nof those studies, however,\nis that the high-salt diet\nis often coupled to other elements of diet\nthat are also unhealthy,\nthings like excessively high\nlevels of carbohydrates or fats\nor combinations of carbohydrates and fats,\nand so while I know\nthere are many burning questions out there\nabout how much salt one needs\nif they are on a low-carbohydrate diet\nor if they are fasting or\nif they are on a vegan diet,\nthere have simply not been many studies\nthat have explored the low, moderate,\nand high-salt conditions\non a backdrop of very\ncontrolled nutrition,\nand that's probably reflective of the fact\nthat there are not a lot\nof very well-controlled\nnutrition studies out there.\nThere are some, of course,\nbut it's very hard to get people to adhere\nto nutritional plans in a very strict way,\nand to do that for\nsufficient periods of time\nthat would allow the various\nhealth outcomes to occur.\nNonetheless, there's\nsome interesting reports\nthat indicate that the\namount of salt intake\ncan indeed predict health outcomes\nor what we call hazardous events,\nthings like cardiovascular\nevents and stroke and so forth,\nand what's interesting\nis that indeed a lower,\nI'm not saying low, right?\nBecause I don't believe\nthat you want your diet\nto be truly low in anything\nexcept, perhaps, poison,\nbut a lower-salt diet can reduce\nthe number of these\nso-called hazardous events,\nbut it's a somewhat of a\nshallow U-shaped function\nsuch that, yes indeed, a high salt intake\ncan be very detrimental for your health,\nboth in terms of\ncardiovascular events, stroke,\nand other deleterious health events,\nbut somewhere in the middle\nthat actually sits quite to the right,\nmeaning higher than what\nis typically recommended\nfor salt intake,\ncan actually reduce the number\nof these hazardous events,\nat least some reports point to that,\nand so I want to emphasize\nwhat one of those particular reports says,\nand I also want to be sure to counter it\nfrom the perspective of the context\nthat that study was set in\nbecause, again, my goal here\nis not to give you a strict\nset of recommendations at all.\nIt's to point you to the literature,\ntry and make that literature\nas clear as possible,\nand allow you to evaluate for yourself,\nand I don't just say that to protect us.\nI say that to protect you\nbecause indeed you are responsible\nfor your health and your health choices,\nso the paper that I'm referring to\nis a very interesting one.\nWe, of course, never want\nto put too much weight\non any one report,\nbut this is a paper that\nwas published in 2011\nin the \"Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association.\"\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Urinary Sodium and Potassium Excretion\n\"and the Risk of Cardiovascular Events.\"\nWe have not talked much\nabout potassium yet,\nbut sodium and potassium\ntend to work in concert\nin the brain and body\nin order to regulate\nvarious physiological functions in health,\nand we'll talk more about\npotassium as time goes on.\nThe key plot or set of data in this study,\nfor those of you that want to\nlook it up, we will link to it.\nThere are a lot of data\nin here, but is Figure 1,\nwhich is basically evaluating\nthe amount of urinary excretion of sodium,\nwhich is a somewhat indirect,\nbut nonetheless valuable measure\nof how much sodium people were ingesting\nand plotted against that is\nwhat they call the hazard ratio,\nand the hazard ratio points to\nthe composite of\ncardiovascular death, stroke,\nmyocardial infarction, and\nan infarct is an injury,\nand hospitalization for\ncongestive heart failure,\nand what it points to is the fact\nthat the hazard ratio is low-ish\nat sodium excretion of\nabout 2 grams per day,\nbut then continues to go down\nuntil about 4.5\nto 5 grams per day\nthat, remember, this is sodium excretion,\nso it's reflective of how\nmuch sodium was in the body,\nwhich is reflective of how\nmuch sodium was ingested,\nand then, the hazard ratio\nincreases fairly dramatically,\na very steep slope,\nheading anywhere from 7 to 8 to 10\nand out towards 12 grams of\nsodium excretion per day,\nso the simplest way to\ninterpret these data\nare that at fairly low levels of sodium,\nmeaning at about 2 grams per day,\nyou run fewer health risks,\nbut the number of risks\ncontinues to decline\nas you move towards 4 and 5 grams per day,\nand then, as you increase\nyour salt intake further,\nthen, the risk dramatically increases,\nso no study is holy,\nnor is any figure in any study\nor any collection of studies holy.\nRather, we always want to look\nat what the bulk of data in\na particular field reveal.\nNonetheless, I think the\nplot that we described,\nmeaning the graph that we described,\nis pretty interesting\nin light of the 2020 to 2025\ndietary recommendations for Americans,\nwhich is that people consume\nno more than 2.3 grams,\nmeaning 2,300 milligrams\nof sodium per day.\nThat's about 1/2 a teaspoon\nof salt per day.\nNow, most people are probably\nconsuming more than that\nbecause of the fact that they\nare ingesting processed foods,\nand processed foods tend\nto have more salt in them\nthan nonprocessed foods.\nNow, of course, that's not\nalways the case, right?\nSea salt is not a processed\nfood, in most cases,\nand there are a lot of unprocessed foods\nthat can be high in sodium,\nbut processed foods, in particular,\ntend to have a lot of sodium.\nYou can see this simply by\nlooking at the packaging\nof any number of different foods,\nbut if we are to take\nthis number of 2.3 grams,\nthat's the recommended cutoff\nfor ingestion of sodium,\nit actually falls in\na portion of the curve\nthat we were talking about a moment ago\nthat indeed is associated with low hazard,\nlow incidence of hazardous outcomes,\ncardiovascular event, stroke, et cetera,\nbut the ingest, according to that plot,\nthe ingestion of 4 or 5 grams of sodium,\nalmost double,\nor more sodium than is\ncurrently recommended,\nis associated with even lower\nnumbers of hazardous events,\nso we need to think about this,\nand we need to explore it\nin the context of other\nstudies, of course,\nand we need to evaluate\nit in terms of this thing\nthat we've been going\nback to again and again,\nwhich is context, right?\nThese recommendations of\n2.3 gram per day cutoff\nis in the context of a\nlandscape where some people\ndo indeed have hypertension\nor prehypertension.\nThe incidence of hypertension\nhas gone up dramatically\nin the last 100 years\nand seems to continue to go up.\nWhether or not that's because\nof increased salt intake\nor whether or not it's because\nof increased salt intake\nand other things such as\nhighly processed foods,\nthat isn't clear,\nagain, pointing to the challenge\nin doing these epidemiological studies\nand really parsing what aspects\nof a change in some health\nmetric is due to, for instance,\nthe ingestion of more\nsugars versus more salts\nor simply because of the\ningestion of more salts.\nIt's a complicated, almost\nbarbed-wire topic by now,\nbut we can start to pull\napart that barbed wire tangle\nand start to evaluate\nsome of the other people\nand other conditions that\nexist out there, maybe for you,\nthat actually warrant more sodium intake\nand where more sodium intake\nmight actually be beneficial,\nso, again, I want to be very, very clear\nthat you need to know your blood pressure.\nIf you have high blood pressure\nor you're prehypertensive,\nyou should be especially cautious\nabout doing anything that\nincreases your blood pressure,\nand, as always, you want to,\nof course, talk to your doctor\nabout doing anything\nthat could adjust your\nhealth in any direction,\nbut nonetheless, there\nare some important papers\nthat have been published in recent years.\nI want to point to one\nof them, in particular.\nThis is a paper that was published\nin the journal \"Autonomic\nNeuroscience: Basic and Clinical\"\nbecause this paper, like\nseveral other papers,\nasked the question,\nand indeed, they ask the\nquestion in the title.\nIt's a review: \"Dietary Sodium and Health:\n\"How Much Is Too Much for Those\nwith Orthostatic Disorders.\"\nNow, orthostatic disorders\ncome in a bunch of different varieties,\nand we're going to talk\nabout those in a moment,\nbut there are a number of people out there\nthat have low blood pressure, right?\nPeople that get dizzy when they stand up,\npeople that are feeling\nchronically fatigued,\nand in some cases, not all,\nthose groups can actually benefit\nfrom increasing their sodium intake.\nSeveral episodes ago on\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI gave a, what, it's just\nclearly what we call anec-data,\nwhich is not even really data.\nIt's just anecdotal data of an individual\nwho was always feeling\nhungry and craving sugar,\nand based on the fact that they\nalso had low blood pressure,\nI had them talk to a physician,\nand they got permission\nto try a little\nmini-experiment on themselves,\nand so they did, and\nthat mini-experiment was\nanytime they felt like\nthey were craving sugar\nor they were feeling a\nlittle lightheaded and dizzy,\nrather than reaching for\nsomething with caloric intake,\nthey took a little bit of sea salt,\na little pinch of sea salt,\nand put it into some water, and drank it,\nor, in the case of this individual,\nthey would actually take\na little sea salt packet,\nand they would actually\njust down a sea salt packet,\nand for them, that\nprovided tremendous relief\nfor their dizziness,\nbut that, of course, was in the context\nof somewhat abnormally low blood pressure,\nso I don't think that they are alone\nin the fact that many people out there\nsuffer from a low blood\npressure condition.\nMany people out there\nsuffer from a high blood\npressure condition,\nso know your blood pressure,\nand understand that\nblood pressure, in part,\nis regulated by your sodium\nintake and your sodium balance.\nWhy?\nWell, because of the osmolarity of blood\nthat we talked about before,\nwhere if you have a certain\nconcentration of sodium,\nmeaning sufficient sodium\nin your bloodstream,\nthat will tend to draw\nwater into the bloodstream,\nand essentially,\nthe pipes that are your\ncapillaries, arteries, and veins\nwill be full.\nThe blood pressure will\nget up to your head,\nwhereas some people, their\nblood pressure is low\nbecause the osmolarity\nof their blood is low,\nand that can have a number\nof downstream consequences.\nI should also mention it can\nbe the consequence itself\nof challenges or even\ndeficits in kidney function,\nbut all of these organs\nare working together,\nso the encouragement here\nis not necessarily to ingest more sodium.\nIt's to know your blood pressure\nand to address whether or not\nan increase in sodium intake\nwould actually benefit your blood pressure\nin a way that could relieve\nsome of the dizziness\nand other symptoms of things\nlike orthostatic disorders,\nbut, of course, to do\nthat in a safe context\nand to never play games\nwith your blood sugar\nor your blood osmolarity\nthat could set your system\ndown a cascade of negative events.\nLet's look at what the\ncurrent recommendations are\nfor people that suffer\nfrom orthostatic disorders\nlike orthostatic hypo,\nmeaning too low, tension,\northostatic hypotension,\npostural tachycardia syndrome,\nsometimes referred to as POTS, P-O-T-S,\nor idiopathic orthostatic\ntachycardia and syncope.\nThese have the incredibly elaborate names.\nThose groups are often told\nto increase their salt intake\nin order to combat their symptoms.\nThe American Society of Hypertension\nrecommends anywhere from 6,000 to 10,000.\nThese are very high levels,\nso this is 6 grams to 10\ngrams of salt per day,\nkeeping in mind, again,\nthat salt is not the same as sodium,\nso that equates\nto about 2,400 to 4,000\nmilligrams of sodium per day.\nAgain, if you want to\nlearn more about this\nand get more of the citations,\nI'll refer you back to this study\non \"Dietary Sodium and Health:\n\"How Much Is Too Much for Those\nwith Orthostatic Disorders.\"\nWe'll put a link to this\nin the caption show notes,\nso that's not just in the U.S.\nThe salt recommendations\nfrom the Canadian Cardiovascular Society\nare 10,000 milligrams of salt per day,\nso 4 grams of sodium is\nwhat that equates to,\nand on and on and on,\nfor things like POTS,\nfor these postural\nsyndromes that result from,\nor I should say from these syndromes\nthat involve low blood pressure\nwhen people stand up\nor in certain postures,\nso I point out this paper,\nand I point out these\nhigher salt recommendations\nto emphasize, again, that\ncontext is vital, right?\nThat people with high blood pressure\nare going to need certain\namounts of salt intake.\nPeople with lower blood pressure,\nand maybe with some of these\npostural orthostatic syndromes,\nare going to need higher amounts of salt,\nand for most people out there,\nyou're going to need to\nevaluate how much salt intake\nis going to allow your brain\nand body to function optimally,\nand there are some fairly\nstraightforward ways\nto explore that,\nand there's some ways to explore that\nin the context of what you already know\nabout thirst and salt appetite\nthat can make that exploration\none in which it's not going to be\na constant wandering around in the dark\nand where you can figure\nout what's right for you.\nFor most people, a moderate\nincrease in salt intake\nis not going to be detrimental\nprovided that you consume enough fluids,\nin particular, water, 'kay?\nMeaning if you happen\nto overeat salt a bit,\nyou will get thirsty, you\nwill ingest more water,\nand you will excrete the excess sodium.\nThere is evidence\nthat the body can store\nsodium in various organs.\nThat storage of sodium\nmay or may not be a detrimental thing.\nIn general, excess storage of sodium\nin tissues and organs\nof the brain and body\nis not thought to be good\nfor long-term health,\nso eating much more sodium than you need\nfor long periods of time\nis indeed bad for you.\nEarlier, I mentioned that salt\nand your hunger and thirst for salt\nis homeostatically regulated,\nand indeed, that's the case,\nmuch like temperature is\nhomeostatically regulated.\nWhat that means is, if\nyou pay attention to it,\nif your salt levels are low,\nyou will tend to crave salt\nand salty beverages and salty foods,\nand in most cases, you should\nprobably follow that craving\nprovided those salty\nbeverages and salty foods\nare not bringing in a lot of other things\nor anything, ideally, that's bad for you,\nso I think it's fair to say\nthat whether or not\nyou're vegan, vegetarian,\ncarnivore, omnivore,\nthat we should all try\nto limit our ingestion\nof processed foods, a'ight?\nMy read of the literature is that, sure,\nsome processed foods are acceptable for us\nand aren't going to kill us outright,\nbut that for most people in the world,\neating fewer processed foods\nis just going to be a good thing to do,\nso following your salt hunger and thirst,\nin most cases, is going to be beneficial\nprovided that it's in the context\nof eating healthy, nonprocessed\nfoods on whatever backdrop\nof nutritional and dietary\nrecommendations is right for you.\nI simply can't tell you what\nto eat and what not to eat\nbecause I acknowledge the fact\nthat some people are vegans\nbecause of ethical reasons\nrelated to animals,\nor some people are\nvegans because of reasons\nrelated to the climate\nand the environment.\nOther people do it for\nspecific health reasons.\nLikewise, I know plenty of people\nthat eat meat and avoid\nvegetables, believe it or not,\nand I know people that eat both,\nand they do this, often,\neach, I should say, all,\nciting literature that\nsupports their particular camp\nand their particular view.\nIt's not a territory I want to get into,\nbut with respect to salt intake\nand the fact that salt intake\nis homeostatically regulated,\nit is the case that if\nyou're craving salt,\nyou probably need it,\nso for those of you that\nare sweating excessively,\nor even if you're in a\nvery hot environment,\nand you're not exercising,\nand you're just losing,\nyou're losing water and\nsalt from your system,\nremember, also, that you can\nbe in a very cold environment,\nvery cold, dry environments\noften go together,\nand you can be losing a lot\nof fluids from your body,\nand you will crave fluids and\nsalt even though it's cold\nand you're not actually\nnoticeably perspiring,\nso if you're exercising a lot,\nif you're in a particular\ncold, dry environment\nor a particular hot environment,\nyou ought to be ingesting\nsufficient amounts of salt and fluid.\nA rule of thumb for exercise-based\nreplenishment of fluid\ncomes from what I, some episodes back,\nreferred to as the Galpin equation.\nThe Galpin equation, I\nnamed it after Andy Galpin,\nand I think that is the\nappropriate attribution there.\nAndy Galpin is an exercise physiologist\nat Cal State, Fullerton, I believe,\nand he's going to be a podcast guest\nhere on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nHe's an exceptional muscle physiologist.\nHe also lives in the practical realm\nwhere he gives\nrecommendations about exercise\nto expert athletes as well\nas the everyday person,\nso the Galpin equation\nis based on the fact\nthat we lose about one to\nfive pounds of water per hour,\nwhich can definitely\nimpact our mental capacity\nand our physical performance,\nand the reason that loss\nof water from our system\nimpacts mental capacity\nand physical performance\nhas a lot to do with, literally,\nthe changes in the volume of those cells,\nthe size of those cells,\nbased on how much sodium is contained\nin or outside those cells,\nand something that I've alluded\nto before on the podcast,\nand I'll talk about more in a moment,\nwhich is that neurons\nsignal to one another\nby way of electricity\nthrough something called\nthe action potential,\nand that actually requires sodium\nand potassium and magnesium,\nso the Galpin equation\nsuggests that we start exercise\nhydrated with electrolytes,\nnot just with water,\nso that means water\nthat has some sodium,\npotassium, and magnesium.\nThere are simple, low-cost ways\nto do that we'll talk about,\nand the formula for hydration,\nthe so-called Galpin equation,\nis your body weight in\npounds divided by 30\nequals the ounces of\nfluid you should drink\nevery 15 minutes.\nThat may turn out to be more fluid\nthan you can comfortably consume\nduring the activity\nthat you're performing.\nNow, the Galpin equation\nis mainly designed for exercise,\nbut I think is actually\na very good rule of thumb\nfor any time that you need\nto engage mental capacity,\nnot just physical performance.\nYour body weight in pounds divided by 30\nequals the ounces of\nfluid you should drink\nevery 15 minutes\ndoes not necessarily mean\nyou have to ingest it\nevery 15 minutes on the dot,\nand I think many activities,\nphysical activities,\nbut also cognitive activities\nlike Zoom meetings or in-person meetings\nor lecturing or running or cycling\nare going to make it complicated\nto ingest the appropriate amount of fluid\nevery 15 minutes on the dot.\nI'm not going to speak\nfor Andy, for Dr. Galpin,\nbut I think he would probably agree\nthat these are averages to shoot for,\nand that unless you're hyperneurotic,\nthe idea is to make sure that\nyou're entering the activity,\ncognitive or physical,\nsufficiently hydrated,\nand that throughout that activity,\nyou're hydrating regularly,\nand it points to the fact\nthat most people are\nprobably underhydrating,\nbut not just underhydrating\nfrom the perspective of\nnot ingesting enough water,\nthat they're probably not getting\nenough electrolytes as well:\nsodium, potassium, and magnesium,\nso I've said two somewhat\ncontradictory things.\nOn the one hand, I've said,\n\"Follow your salt appetite.\n\"Follow your salt thirst.\n\"If you're craving salt,\n\"ingest some salt until\nyou stop craving the salt.\"\nOn the other hand,\nI've given you this fairly\nspecific recommendation\nbased on the Galpin equation\nthat you should ingest\nyour body weight in pounds\ndivided by 30.\nThat's how many ounces\nof fluid you should drink\nevery 15 minutes,\nwhich I'm guessing, for most people,\nis going to be more fluid\nthan they're currently\ndrinking, on average,\nand so how could it be\nthat you can have a\nrecommendation for what's optimal\nthat's different than the amount\nthat you would reflexively drink?\nAnd it has to do with the fact\nthat a lot of the hormone systems\nlike vasopressin antidiuretic hormone,\nother hormones like aldosterone,\nand a lot of the neural\nand hormonal signals\nthat govern salt and water balance\nare fairly slow to kick in,\nso, for instance, if you\neat a fairly salty meal,\nand you sense that salt,\nyou'll probably, meaning you\ndetect it and perceive it\nbecause the food tastes salty,\nyou'll probably want to drink\na fair amount of fluid with it,\nwhereas if some of the salt\nis disguised by other flavors,\nsomething that we'll talk\nabout in a few minutes\nwhen we talk about the\nneural representation\nof things like salty and sweet,\nwell, then, you might not\nnotice that something's salty,\nand then, a few minutes or\nhours after ingesting that meal,\nyou might feel very, very tired.\nYou might even wonder\nwhether or not it's because\nof some blood sugar effect.\nMaybe it's a crash in blood\nsugar, you might think,\nor something else related to that meal,\nor maybe you think\nit's because of some\nother event in your life,\nbut actually, what has\nhappened is you're dehydrated\nbecause you didn't recognize\nthat you needed to drink more fluids,\nso I want to acknowledge the contradiction\nin the idea that everything\nis homeostatically regulated,\nand therefore you are\naware of what you need,\nand the counterargument that,\nah, you need to follow\nthese strict recommendations\nis actually going to be\nsomewhere in between,\nand, of course, your body\nand brain can start to adapt\nto certain levels of salt intake.\nThere's now a fairly famous study\nthat was done in Germany\nwhich looked at different\nphases of salt intake,\nmeaning they had subjects ingest\neither 12 grams of salt\nper day or 9 grams per day\nor 6 grams per day for\nfairly long periods of time,\nand they collected urine for testing.\nThis was actually a very controlled study.\nI'm just going to paraphrase\nfrom the National Institutes\nof Health report on this study\nbecause they did a very\nnice write-up of it,\nand they say that a big\nsurprise of these results\nis that whatever the level\nof salt that was consumed,\nsodium was stored and released\nfrom the subjects' bodies\nin fairly regular weekly\nand monthly patterns,\nmeaning people tended to adapt\nto a certain level of salt intake,\nand then it led to a\nfairly constant amount\nof salt retention and\nurine fluid excretion,\nand that's because of\nthe various hormones,\nlike aldosterone,\nwhich regulates sodium\nexcretion from the kidney,\nand glucocorticoids,\nwhich we'll talk about more in a moment,\nwhich help regulate metabolism.\nGlucocorticoids are released\nfrom the adrenal glands,\nwhich ride atop the kidneys,\nand there's a very close relationship\nbetween the stress system glucocorticoids\nand the salt system,\nso the reason why your salt appetite\nisn't a perfect readout of how\nmuch salt you should ingest\nand why it might be helpful to\nfollow some of these formulas\nlike the Galpin equation,\nespecially if you're engaging in exercise\nwhere you're going to be\nperspiring, of course,\nis that your body will tend to adapt\nto a certain amount of\nsalt intake over time,\nand then, your appetite for salt\nwon't necessarily be the best indication\nof how much salt you\nshould ingest or avoid.\nBefore I move on,\nI want to really reemphasize the fact\nthat inside of the Galpin equation\nthere is that mention of every 15 minutes,\nand people have come back to\nme again and again about this\nsaying, \"I can't drink that\nmuch water every 15 minutes.\n\"It's too much volume\nof fluid in my stomach.\n\"I can't run with that,\" et cetera.\nRemember, these are averages,\nso that's what you want to average\naround a particular activity.\nThese not strict recommendations\nwhere a buzzer goes off\nand every 15 minutes you have to chug\nthat exact amount of\nelectrolyte-containing solution.\nAnother key feature of the study\nthat I was referring to before,\nwhich, incidentally,\nwas published in the \"Journal\nof Clinical Investigation,\"\nis that the body regulates\nits salt and water balance,\nnot just by excreting sodium, right?\nBut by retaining or releasing water,\nand this is because of the relationship\nbetween sodium and water that\nwe were talking about before,\nand the advantage of this\nmechanism, they state,\nhere I'm paraphrasing,\nis that the long-term\nmaintenance of body fluids\nis dependent, is not as\ndependent on external water\nas once believed, right?\nWhat this system probably evolved to do\nwas to adjust to different\nlevels of sodium availability\nin the environment,\nand that raises a really key element\nof salt and its importance\nin human history\nand human evolution and human health.\nHaven't talked too much about this,\nand there are several very good books\nabout the history of salt.\nSalt was a very valuable\nand heavily sought-after substance\nthroughout much of human history,\nso much so that there are\nactually written reports\nof people being paid for\nlabor in the form of salt,\nand salt, when it's scarce,\nhas been quite expensive in\ncertain regions of the world,\nespecially regions located\nfurther away from the sea,\nand a friend of mine\nwho has deep roots within\nthe culinary community\ntold me about traveling\nto some somewhat impoverished\nareas of Europe some years ago\nand going into homes where\nin the middle of the kitchen\ntable, there was a fish,\na salty fish hanging from a thread\nabove the table,\nand that because of a lack of\navailability of table salt,\nthe common practice was to take any food\nthat needed some salt\nfor additional flavoring\nand to actually rub that\nfood on this salty fish\nor to squeeze the fish a\nbit onto the food substance\nin order to get salt from it,\nso that's a very kind of extreme example.\nNowadays, we kind of\ntake salt for granted,\nand most of the discussion out\nthere is about excess salt,\nbut, as I'm pointing out,\nthat salt, for a long time,\nhas been a very sought-after commodity\nand one that people really\ncherished for their health.\nIn the episode that I did on metabolism,\nI talked about the relationship\nbetween salt and iodine.\nIf you're interested in iodine\nand whether or not iodized\nsalt or noniodized salt\nis best or required,\nI'd encourage you to\nlisten to that episode,\nwhich was about, again, metabolism.\nSome people may need more iodine intake.\nSome people perhaps do not.\nSome people might even want\nto ingest things like kelp.\nSome people might not,\nso please listen to that episode\nif you're interested in\nthe iodine aspects of salt,\nwhich have direct impact\non thyroid hormone and thyroid function,\nwhich, of course, relates to metabolism.\nNowadays. there's a lot of interest in\nand even a kind of proliferation\nof what I call fancy salts,\nso whether or not you should\nbe ingesting sea salts\nor common, whether or not\ncommon table salt will suffice.\nIn most cases, for what\nwe're discussing here,\ncommon table salt is fine,\nbut I should point out that sea salt\noften contains other minerals,\nwhich can be very useful,\nand we will do entire episodes\non those other minerals,\nso sea salt can contain\ndozens or more of minerals,\nsome of which can be quite\nvaluable to our health,\nothers of which are less important\nand only need to be\nconsumed in trace amounts,\nbut you're not going to\nget many minerals, if any,\nfrom common table salt,\nand that's why, in addition\nto the pretty colors,\nand, perhaps, some people report\nthat they actually taste better,\nsome of these so-called\nfancy salts or sea salts,\nyou might want to consume\na more advanced form of salt, if you will,\nalthough I suppose\nit's actually the more\nprimitive form of salt\nif it's actually the one\nthat comes from the ocean,\nso we've all heard about how excess salt,\nit's bad for blood pressure,\ndamage the heart, the brain, et cetera.\nI do want to give some voice to situations\nwhere too little salt can\nactually cause problems,\nand this has everything to\ndo with the nervous system,\nso without getting into\nexcessive amounts of detail,\nthe kidneys, as we talked about before,\nare going to regulate\nsalt and fluid balance.\nThe adrenal glands, which\nride atop the kidneys,\nare going to make\nglucocorticoids, like aldosterone,\nand those are going to directly impact\nthings like fluid balance,\nand, in part, they do that\nby regulating how much craving for\nand tolerance of salty solutions we have,\nand there's some really nice studies\nthat have looked at\nso-called adrenalectomies.\nNow, this is an extreme case,\nand it's typically done in animal models,\nbut it illustrates the\nrole of the adrenals\nin salt preference.\nBasically, when the glucocorticoid system,\nmeaning the release of\nthese particular hormones\nfrom the adrenal glands,\nis eliminated by adrenalectomy,\n-ectomy means removal,\nthen, the threshold for\nwhat's considered too salty\nreally shifts, okay?\nSo typically, when the\nadrenals are intact,\na animal or a human\nwill prefer a mildly salty\nto moderately salty\nsolution if given a choice,\nand at some point,\nit's so salty that it just feels aversive,\njust like taking a gulp of seawater\nis almost always aversive.\nI can't think of an instance\nwhere it's not aversive,\nand actually drinking\nseawater can kill you\nbecause of the high\nosmolarity of seawater.\nYou certainly don't\nwant to drink seawater.\nUnder conditions where\nthe adrenals are missing,\nanimals and humans will tend to prefer\na higher sodium concentration fluid,\nand they will be willing to tolerate\ningesting very high\nconcentrations of sodium.\nNow, that's a very crude experiment,\nand not one that you want\nto do, I promise you,\nbut I mention it\nbecause it illustrates the\nvery direct relationship\nbetween the stress system,\nwhich is the glucocorticoid system,\nand the salt craving system,\nand this actually makes sense.\nEarlier, as we were talking\nabout hypovolemic thirst,\nwhen there's a loss of\nblood pressure from,\nusually due to a loss\nof blood from the body,\nthere's a salt craving\nin order to bring that\nblood volume back up\nbecause by ingesting salt,\nyou bring fluid into the bloodstream.\nYou're increasing that blood pressure,\nand you can restore the blood that's lost.\nNow, there are many examples where,\nif sodium levels get too\nlow in the bloodstream,\neither because people are\ningesting too little salt,\nor they're ingesting too much water\nand therefore excreting too much salt,\nthat it can cause stress and anxiety.\nThere's some really nice data\nthat point to the fact\nthat low dietary sodium\ncan actually exacerbate\nanxiety in animal models,\nand to some extent,\nthere's evidence for\nthis in humans as well,\nand that should not come as a surprise.\nThe whole basis for a relationship\nbetween the adrenal system,\nthese glucocorticoids,\nthings like aldosterone,\nand the craving for sodium\nis that the stress system\nis a generic system\ndesigned to deal with various\nchallenges to the organism,\nto you or to me or to an animal,\nand those challenges can\narrive in many different forms.\nIt can be an infection. It can be famine.\nIt can be lack of water and so on,\nbut in general,\nthe stress response is one\nof elevated heart rate,\nelevated blood pressure,\nand an ability to maintain movement\nand resistance to that challenge, 'kay?\nI've said this before, but\nI'll emphasize it again,\nthere's this common misperception\nthat stress makes us sick,\nand indeed, if stress lasts too long,\nit has a number of negative\neffects on our health,\nbut more often than not, if\nwe're pushing, pushing, pushing,\nwe're studying or taking care of somebody\nor traveling like crazy,\nwe don't tend to get sick\nunder those conditions,\nbut as soon as we stop,\nas soon as we reduce\nour adrenaline output,\nas soon as we reduce our\nglucocorticoid output\nfrom our adrenals,\nthen we will get sick.\nThat's a very common occurrence,\nand it's because stress actually\nactivates our immune system\nin the short term,\nso I'd like to try and dispel this myth\nthat stress actually\nsuppresses the immune system,\nat least not in the short term.\nFor long-term stress,\nit's a different issue.\nYou don't want long-term ongoing stress,\nespecially of several weeks or more.\nNonetheless, it makes sense\nthat bringing sodium into the body\nwould be at least one way\nthat we would be wired\nto counteract or to\nresist stressors, right?\nStressors being the things\non the outside coming at us,\nso it could be stressful relationships,\nstressful job situation,\nagain, infection, and so on.\nIt's clear from a number of studies\nthat if sodium levels are too low,\nthat our ability to meet\nstress challenges is impaired.\nNow, that doesn't mean\nto place your sodium\nintake cosmically high,\nbut it does point to the fact that\nif you're feeling anxious,\nperhaps from low blood pressure,\nwhich can also give symptoms of anxiety,\nas we talked about before,\nbut even if it's independent\nof low blood pressure,\nthat slightly increasing sodium intake,\nagain, I would encourage people to do this\nnot in the context of\nprocessed foods and drinks,\nbut ideally, in the form\nof maybe a little bit\nof sea salt and water\nor salting one's food a little bit more,\nthat that can stabilize blood pressure\nand one's ability to lean\ninto stressors and challenges,\nand I say this because I\nthink that most people assume\nthat adding salt is always bad,\nwhen, in fact, that's simply not the case.\nThere are conditions,\nsuch as when we are\nunder stress challenge,\nwhen there is a natural\ncraving for more sodium,\nand that natural craving for more sodium\nis hardwired into us as a\nway to meet that challenge,\nso it's hard for me to know\nwhether or not people out there,\nespecially the listeners of this podcast,\nare getting too much, just\nenough, or too little sodium,\nso I can't know that.\nI'm shouting into a tunnel here.\nYou have to decide how much\nsodium you are ingesting,\nbut I think that there's\nsome, for most people,\nespecially people who are not\nhypertensive, prehypertensive,\nthere's some wiggle room\nto explore whether more intake of sodium\ncould actually be beneficial\nfor suppressing some of\nthe anxiety responses\nthat they might feel under\nconditions of stress.\nAgain, more studies need to be done.\nCertainly, more studies\nin humans need to be done,\nbut the relationship between\nstress and sodium intake\nand the fact that additional\nsodium intake may be beneficial\nand indeed, is naturally\nstimulated by stress\nshouldn't be necessarily looked\nat as a pathological event.\nI know when some people get stressed,\nthey crave salty foods.\nThat's actually a hardwired\nbiological phenomenon\nthat you see, not just in\nhumans, but in animals,\nbecause this is a very primitive mechanism\nwhereby your body is preparing\nto meet any additional\nchallenges and stressors.\nNow, we can't have a\ndiscussion about sodium\nwithout having a discussion\nabout the other electrolytes,\nmagnesium and potassium.\nMagnesium is important enough\nand an extensive enough topic\nthat we should probably\ndo an entire episode\njust on magnesium.\nFor purposes of today's discussion,\nI just will briefly touch on\nsome of the forms of magnesium\nthat we've discussed on the podcast before\nin different contexts.\nI want to emphasize that many people\nare probably getting enough\nmagnesium in their diet\nthat they don't need to\nsupplement magnesium.\nSome people, however, opt\nto supplement magnesium\nin ways that can support them,\nand there are many different\nforms of magnesium,\nand just in very brief passing,\nI'll just say that there is some evidence\nthat you can reduce muscle\nsoreness from exercise\nby ingestion of magnesium\nmalate, M-A-L-A-T-E.\nI've talked before about\nmagnesium threonate,\nT-H-R-E-N-O-A-T-E, magnesium threonate,\nfor sake of promoting\nthe transition into sleep\nand for depth of sleep\nand perhaps, again, highlighted perhaps,\n'cause right now it's\nmainly animal studies\nand ongoing human studies,\nbut the data aren't all in.\nPerhaps magnesium threonate can be used\nas a way to support cognitive\nfunction and longevity.\nThat was discussed in the episode\nwith Dr. Jack Feldman from UCLA.\nTypically, magnesium threonate is taken\n30 to 60 minutes before bedtime\nin order to encourage sleep.\nYou can go to our neural\nnetwork newsletter\nand look for the one on sleep,\nand you can see the recommendations,\nor I should say, the options for that\nbecause, again, you should\nalways check with your physician.\nThose aren't strict\nacross-the-board recommendations,\nand then, there are\nother forms of magnesium:\nmagnesium bisglycinate,\nwhich is a somewhat of an\nalternative to threonate,\nnot known to have cognitive\nenhancing effects,\nbut seems, at least on par\nwith magnesium threonate\nin terms of promoting transition into\nand depth of sleep and so on.\nThere are other forms of\nmagnesium, magnesium citrate,\nwhich has other functions.\nActually, magnesium citrate\nis a fairly effective laxative,\nnot known to promote sleep\nand things of that sort,\nso a lot of different forms of magnesium,\nand there's still other forms out there.\nMany people are not\ngetting enough magnesium.\nMany people are.\nOkay, that's magnesium.\nAnytime we're talking\nabout sodium balance,\nwe have to take into\nconsideration potassium\nbecause the way that the kidney works\nand the way that sodium\nbalance is regulated,\nboth in the body and the brain,\nis that sodium and potassium\nare working in close\nconcert with one another.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent recommendations\nabout ratios out there,\nand they range widely\nfrom two-to-one ratio\nof potassium to sodium.\nI've heard it in the other direction too.\nI've heard a two-to-one\nsodium to potassium.\nThe recommendations vary.\nOne of the sponsors of\nthis podcast, for instance,\nLMNT, which I've talked about\nin this episode and before,\nthe ratio there is a gram of sodium\nto 200 milligrams of potassium,\n60 milligrams of magnesium,\nso there, they've opted\nfor a five-to-one ratio\nof sodium to potassium,\nand, of course, many people opt\nto make their own hydration\nelectrolyte formulas.\nThey'll put sea salt into some water,\nmaybe even ingest a potassium tablet.\nIt all depends on the context,\nand an important contextual\nelement is your diet,\nso, for instance, carbohydrates\nhold water in the body,\nso regardless of how much salt\nand how much fluid you're ingesting,\nif you're ingesting carbohydrate\nand you drink fluids, water,\nsome of that fluid is going\nto be retained in the body.\nNow, for people that are\nfollowing low-carbohydrate diets,\none of the most immediate effects\nof a low-carbohydrate diet\nis that you're going\nto excrete more water,\nand so, under those conditions,\nyou're also going to lose not just water,\nbut you'll probably also\nlose sodium and potassium,\nand so some people, many people, in fact,\nfind that when they are on a\nlower or low-carbohydrate diet,\nthen they need to make sure\nthat they're getting enough\nsodium and enough potassium,\nand some people do that\nby taking 99-milligram potassium tablets\nevery time they eat.\nSome people do that\nby ingesting more foods\nthat contain potassium,\nand, of course,\nsome people who are on\nlow-carbohydrate diets\ndo ingest vegetables\nor other forms of food that\ncarry along with them potassium,\nso it's quite variable\nfrom person to person.\nI mean, you can imagine if\ncarbohydrate holds water,\nwater and salt balance and potassium\ngo hand in hand, and hand,\nthat if you're on a low-carbohydrate diet,\nthat you might need to adjust\nyour salt intake and potassium,\nand conversely, that if you're\non a carbohydrate-rich diet\nor a moderate carbohydrate diet,\nthen you may need to ingest\nless sodium and less potassium,\nand, in fact, a certain amount of water\nis probably coming in through\nthe foods you eat as well,\nso I don't say all this to confuse you.\nAgain, I say this because it\nall depends on the context.\nI'll give yet another context\nthat I think is fairly common nowadays,\nwhich is many people are\nfollowing a pattern of eating\nthat more or less resembles\nintermittent fasting\nor at least time-restricted feeding,\nso they're eating between\nparticular feeding windows,\nand then, in the certain\nparts of the 24-hour cycle,\nnot just sleep,\nbut during certain parts\nof their waking cycle,\nthey're also actively avoiding food,\nbanking on, I think, either the possible,\nI want to say possible,\nlongevity-promoting effects\nof intermittent fasting,\nor, and/or, I should say,\nthey are banking on the\nfact that for many people,\nnot eating is easier than portion control\nfor certain parts of the day,\nand so they find it beneficial\nto limit calories overall\nto a given amount, depending\non what their goals are,\nby not consuming food for\ncertain periods of the day,\nbut usually, during\nthose periods of the day,\nthey're consuming fluids,\nand oftentimes, those fluids\ninclude not just water,\nbut caffeine, and caffeine is a diuretic.\nIt actually causes the excretion\nof fluids from the body\nin part, because it causes\nthe excretion of sodium.\nAll of that to say\nthat if you're somebody who, for instance,\neats your first meal around\nnoon or 1:00 or 2:00 p.m.,\nand you're fasting for\nthe early part of the day,\nand you're drinking coffee or tea\nor ingesting a lot of water,\nyou are going to be excreting\nsodium along with that water,\nand so many people, including\nmyself, find that it's useful,\nespecially when I'm drinking caffeine\nduring that so-called fasting\nor nonfood intake part of\ntime-restricted feeding,\nthat I'm making sure to get enough salt,\neither in the form of something like LMNT,\nan electrolyte drink,\nor putting some sea salt into some water,\nor certainly, anytime one\nis ingesting caffeine,\nreplacing some of the lost water\nby increasing one's water intake.\nThere are some simple\nrules of thumb around this\nthat I think can get\nmost people into a place\nwhere they're more comfortable\nand functioning better,\nwhich is for every ounce of\ncoffee or tea that you drink,\nI should say caffeinated\ncoffee or tea that you drink,\nthat you consume 1 1/2\ntimes as much water,\nso let's say you have an 8-ounce coffee,\ntry and drink about, you\ndon't have to be exact,\nbut try and drink about a\n12-ounce glass of water,\nand you might want to put a\ntiny bit of sodium into that.\nBy tiny bit, I just mean\na tiny pinch of sodium\nbecause remember, even if we're talking\nabout increasing the amount\nof sodium intake overall,\nthe total amount of\nsodium contained in salt\nis sufficiently high that\neven just 1/4 teaspoon\nis going to really start\nto move that number\nup towards that range that's\nstill within the safe range,\nbut you're going to, if you\nkeep doing that all day long,\nyou're very quickly\ngoing to get into that\nexcessive salt intake range\nthat is deleterious for health,\nso again, if you're\nconsuming more caffeine,\nyou're going to be excreting\nwater and salt and potassium,\nand so you're going to have to find ways\nto bring water, salt,\nand potassium back in.\nAgain, this has to be evaluated\nfor each of your own\nindividual situations.\nIf you're exercising fasted,\nand you're doing that\nafter drinking caffeine,\nthen before, during, and\ncertainly after exercise,\nyou're going to want to replenish\nthe fluids and electrolytes\nthat you lost, including sodium,\nso you can imagine\nhow this all starts to\nbecome pretty dizzying,\nand yet it doesn't have to be dizzying.\nWe can provide some useful ranges\nthat, for most people, will work,\nand so let's talk about\nwhat those ranges are,\nand I'm going to point you to a resource\nthat explores what those ranges are\nin these various contexts of\nnutrition, exercise, and so on.\nThe resource is a book\nthat was authored by Dr.\nJames DiNicolantonio.\nHe's not a medical doctor.\nHe's a scientist,\nso he's cardiovascular physiology\nas well, I believe, as\na doctor of pharmacy,\nand the title of the\nbook is \"The Salt Fix.\"\n\"The Salt Fix\" is an interesting read\nbecause it points to, first of all,\nthe history of salt in society\nand as it relates to health.\nIt actually emphasizes\nsome of the major missteps,\nmaybe even pretty drastic errors,\nthat have been made in terms\nof trying to interpret the role\nthat salt has in various diseases\nand emphasizes some of the\nways in which, perhaps,\nincreasing salt can actually\nimprove health outcomes,\nand I think it strikes\na pretty nice balance\nbetween what's commonly known about salt\nand what I believe ought\nto be known about salt,\nor at least taken into consideration.\nThe book does provide\ncertain recommendations,\nand I actually reached out to the author.\nI've never met him in person\nor talked to him directly,\nand I asked him outright.\nI said, \"How much salt\n\"do you recommend people take on average?\"\nAnd he gave, of course,\nthe appropriate caveats\nabout prehypertension,\nhypertension, et cetera,\nbut made a recommendation\nwhich I'll just share with you,\nand if you want to learn more\nabout the support for this recommendation,\nyou can check out his book.\nThe recommendation he made was\nanywhere from 8 to 12 grams of salt a day,\nwhich corresponds to\n3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium,\nso going back to the\ncurrent recommendations\nthat we talked about before,\n2.3 grams of sodium per day,\nthis is about 1 1/2 times\nto double the amount of sodium\nthat's currently\nrecommended in most circles,\nand then, what this corresponds to\nis about 1 1/2 to 2\nteaspoons of salt per day\nto arrive at that 3.2\nto 4.8 grams of sodium.\nAgain, this is the recommendation\nthat was passed along for\nmost people, most conditions,\nbarring specific health issues.\nNow, what was also interesting is\nhe pointed to a sodium-to-potassium ratio,\nwhich is 4 grams of potassium,\nand he also mentioned 400\nmilligrams of magnesium,\nand pointed out, and I\ngenerally agree here,\nthat many people are\ndeficient in magnesium,\nso again, that was a 3.2\nto 4.8 grams of sodium,\n4 grams of potassium.\nYou might think, \"Well, gosh,\n\"that's 1 1/2 to 2 times\nthe current recommendation,\"\nbut we can go back to that study\nthat was mentioned earlier in the episode,\nthat 2011 study,\nwhere I describe this\nsort of J-shaped curve\nin which, when you look at the occurrence\nof these negative health events,\nthey were fairly low at low sodium intake,\nlower still at slightly\nhigher sodium intake,\nmuch in line with the\nrecommendations that are made\nor that Dr. DiNicolantonio\npassed along to me,\nand then, they increased quite,\nthose health risks increased\nquite substantially\nas one moves out past 6 grams of sodium,\n7 grams of sodium per day.\nThat's when things really\ndo seem to get hazardous,\nand really, it makes sense, I think,\ngiven the consensus around this,\nto really avoid very high salt intake,\nso \"The Salt Fix\" describes the rationale\nbehind those recommendations.\n\"The Salt Fix\" also describes,\nin quite beautiful detail,\nthe relationship between salt\nintake, potassium intake,\nand the relationship to the\nsugar consumption system.\nI'd like to pick up on this idea\nof the relationship between salt and sugar\nbecause I think that one key aspect\nof the way that salt can work\nand can benefit us or can\nharm us has to do with the way\nthat sodium and sugar are regulated\nand actually perceived by the brain\nand how,\nunder conditions of certain\nlevels of sodium intake,\nwe might be inspired to seek more sugar\nor to crave sweets more or less,\nso up until now,\nwe've been talking about\nsalt as a substance\nand a way to regulate fluid balance\nand blood volume and so on.\nWe haven't talked a lot\nabout salt as a taste\nor the taste of things that are salty,\nand yet we know that\nwe have salt receptors,\nmeaning neurons,\nthat fire action potentials\nwhen salty substances are detected,\nmuch in the same way that\nwe have sweet detectors\nand bitter detectors,\nand we have detectors of\numami, the savory flavor,\non our tongue,\nand earlier, at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nI talked about the fact that\nwe have sweet receptors,\nneurons that respond to\nthe presence of sugar\nor even noncaloric\nsweet things in the gut,\nand that signals up to the\nbrain through the vagus nerve,\nand those signals converge on pathways\nthat relate to dopamine and so on.\nWell, we also have salt sensors\nat various locations\nthroughout our digestive tract,\nalthough the sensation\nand the taste of salt\nactually exerts a very robust effect\non certain areas of the brain\nthat can either make us crave more\nor sate, meaning fulfill,\nour desire for salt,\nand you can imagine why\nthis would be important.\nYour brain actually has to register\nwhether or not you're bringing in salt\nin order to know whether or not\nyou are going to crave salt more or not,\nand beautiful work that's\nbeen done by the Zuker Lab,\nZ-U-K-E-R, Zuker Lab\nat Columbia University,\nas well as many other labs\nhave used imaging techniques\nand other techniques\nsuch as molecular biology\nto define these so-called\nparallel pathways,\nparallel meaning pathways\nthat represent sweet\nor the presence of sweet\ntaste in the mouth and gut,\nparallel pathways, meaning neural circuits\nthat represent the\npresence of salty tastes\nin the mouth and gut and so on,\nand that those go into the brain,\nmove up through brain stem centers\nand up to the neocortex\nindeed where our seed of\nour conscious perception is\nto give us a sense and a perception\nof the components of the foods\nthat we happen to be ingesting\nand a sense and a perception of the fluids\nand the components of those fluids\nthat we happen to be ingesting.\nNow, parallel pathways,\nas I'm describing them,\nare a fundamental feature\nof every sensory system,\nnot just the taste system,\nbut also the visual system.\nWe have parallel pathways\nfor perceiving dark objects\nversus light objects,\nfor perceiving red\nversus green, et cetera.\nThis is a fundamental\nfeature of how we are built\nand how our nervous system works,\nand in the taste system, much\nlike in these other systems,\nthese pathways are indeed parallel,\nbut they converge, and they\ncan influence one another,\nand I think the simplest way to put this\nis in the context, first,\nof the visual system,\nwhereby your ability\nto detect the color red\nhas everything to do with the fact\nthat you have neurons in your eye\nthat absorb long wavelengths\nof light that we call reds,\nred wavelengths of light,\nwhich are longer wavelengths\nthan, say, blue light,\nwhich are shorter wavelength,\nbut it is really the comparison\nof the electrical activity\nof the neurons that absorb red light\nwith the activity of the\nneurons that absorb green light\nwhich actually gives you\nthe perception of red,\nso that might seem a\nlittle counterintuitive,\nbut indeed, it's not.\nIt's actually because something is red\nand has less greenness\nthat we perceive it as\nmore red than the green,\nand this is actually the way\nthat your entire nervous system works\nis that we aren't really good\nat evaluating absolute levels of anything\nin the context or perception.\nIt's only by comparison,\nand actually, there's a fun\nexperiment that you can do,\nI think you could probably\nfind it easily online,\nbut you could also do\nthis experiment at home.\nYou can stare at something that's red,\nor green, for that matter, for a while,\nso you make an active\ndecision to not blink\nand to stare at something that's red,\nand then you look away from that thing,\nand you'll actually see a green afterimage\nof that red object.\nConversely, if you look at something\nthat's green for a while,\nand you stare at it, and you look away,\nyou will see the red\nafterimage of that thing.\nNow, the taste system doesn't have\nquite the same aftertaste type effect,\nbut nonetheless, the pathways,\nthe parallel pathways for salty\nand the parallel pathways for\nsweet and bitter and so on\ncan actually interact,\nand this has important relevance\nin the context of food\nchoices and sugar craving.\nOne of the things that's\ncommonplace nowadays is\nin many processed foods there\nis a business, literally,\na business of putting\nso-called hidden sugars,\nand these hidden sugars\nare not always in the\nform of caloric sugars.\nThey're sometimes in the\nform of artificial sweeteners\ninto various foods,\nand you might say, \"Well,\n\"why would they put more sugar into a food\n\"and then disguise the sugary taste\n\"given that sweet tastes\noften compel people\n\"to eat more of these things?\"\nWell, it's a way, actually,\nof bypassing some of the\nhomeostatic mechanisms for sweet,\neven though we might think that\nthe more sweet stuff we eat,\nthe more sweet stuff we crave,\nin general, people have a threshold\nwhereby they say, \"Okay, I've\nhad enough sugary stuff.\"\nYou can actually experience this.\nIf you ever feel like something\nis really, really sweet,\ntake a little sip of water\nwith a little bit of lemon\njuice in it or vinegar,\nand it will quickly quench\nthat overly sweet sensation or perception.\nIt will disappear almost immediately.\nThere's actually a practice in fancy meals\nof cleansing the palate\nthrough the ingestion of different foods,\nand that's the same idea that\nyou're cleansing the palate.\nYou're actually neutralizing\nthe previous taste\nso then they can bring yet another dish\nto overindulge you in\ndecadence and so forth,\nso these sensory systems\ninteract in this way.\nBy putting sugars into foods\nand hiding the sugary\ntaste of those foods,\nthose foods, even if they\ncontain artificial sweeteners,\ncan activate the sorts of neurons\nthat we talked about at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nlike the neuropod cells\nthat will then signal to the\nbrain to release more dopamine\nand make you crave more of that food,\nwhereas had you been able\nto perceive the true\nsweetness of that food,\nyou might have consumed less,\nand indeed, that's what happens,\nso these hidden sugars\nare kind of diabolical.\nWhy am I talking about all of this\nin the context of an episode on salt?\nWell, as many of you\nhave probably noticed,\na lot of foods out there\ncontain a salty-sweet combination,\nand it's that combination\nof salty and sweet\nwhich can actually lead you to consume\nmore of the salty-sweet\nfood than you would have\nif it had just been sweet\nor it had just been salty,\nand that's because both\nsweet taste and salty taste\nhave a homeostatic balance,\nso if you ingest something\nthat's very, very salty,\npretty soon your appetite for\nsalty foods will be reduced,\nbut if you mask some of that with sweet,\nwell, because of the interactions\nof these parallel pathways,\nyou somewhat shut down your perception\nof how much salt you're ingesting,\nor conversely, by ingesting\nsome salt with sweet foods,\nyou mask some of the sweetness\nof the sweet foods that you're tasting,\nand you will continue to\nindulge in those foods,\nso salty-sweet interactions\ncan be very diabolical.\nThey can also be very tasty,\nbut they can be very diabolical\nin terms of inspiring you to\neat more of a particular food\nthan you would otherwise\nif you were just following\nyour homeostatic salt\nor your homeostatic sugar balance systems,\nand the beautiful imaging\nwork that's been done\nby the Zuker Lab and other labs\nhas actually been able to reveal\nhow some of this might work\nby showing, for instance,\nthat a certain ensemble,\nmeaning a certain group of neurons,\nis activated by a sweet taste\nand a nonoverlapping distinct\nset of neurons just nearby\nsitting cheek-to-jowl\nwith those other neurons\nwould be activated by salty tastes\nand yet others by bitter taste et cetera,\nso there's a separate map\nof these different parallel pathways,\nbut that when foods or fluids are ingested\nthat are both salty and sweet,\nyou get a yet entirely different ensemble\nof neurons activated,\nso your brain, whether or not\nit's for your visual system\nor your auditory system\nor your taste system,\nhas a way of representing\nthe pure form of taste,\nsalty, sweet, bitter, et cetera,\nand has a way of representing\ntheir combinations,\nand food manufacturers have\nexploited this to large degree.\nI mention all of this\nbecause if you're somebody\nwho's looking to explore\neither increasing or\ndecreasing your sodium intake\nfor health benefits, for\nperformance benefits,\nin many ways, it is useful to do that\nin the context of a fairly pure,\nmeaning unprocessed\nfood intake background,\nwhether or not that's key\nto a carnivore, omnivore,\nintermittent fasting, or what have you.\nIt doesn't really matter,\nbut the closer that foods are\nto their basic form and taste,\nmeaning not large combinations\nof large amounts of ingredients\nand certainly avoiding\nhighly processed foods,\nthe more quickly you're\ngoing to be able to hone in\non your specific salt\nappetite and salt needs,\nwhich, as I've pointed out numerous times\nthroughout this episode,\nare going to vary from person to person\ndepending on nutrition,\ndepending on activity,\ndepending on hormone status,\nor even portion of your\nmenstrual cycle, for that matter,\nso if you want to home in\non the appropriate\namount of sodium for you,\nyes, blood pressure is going\nto be an important metric\nto pay attention to as you go along,\nand the parameters for\nhealthy blood pressure ranges\nare readily available online,\nso I'll let you refer to those\nin order to determine those for yourself,\nbut in determining whether or not\nincreasing your salt\nintake might be beneficial,\nfor instance, for reducing anxiety a bit\nor for increasing blood pressure\nto offset some of these postural syndromes\nwhere you get dizzy, et cetera,\nfor improving sports performance\nor cognitive performance,\nI can only recommend that you do this\nin a fairly clean context\nwhere you're not trying to do this\nby ingesting a bunch of salty foods\nor salty-sweet foods, et cetera,\nand indeed, many people find,\nand it's reviewed a bit,\nand some of the data are reviewed\nin the book \"The Salt Fix,\"\nthat when people increase\ntheir salt intake\nin a backdrop of relatively\nunprocessed foods,\nthat sugar cravings can\nindeed be vastly reduced,\nand that makes sense\ngiven the way that these neural pathways\nfor salty and sweet interact.\nNow, thus far, I've already\ncovered quite a lot of material,\nbut I would be completely remiss\nif I didn't emphasize the\ncrucial role that sodium plays\nin the way that neurons function.\nIn fact, sodium is one of the key elements\nthat allows neurons to function at all,\nand that's by way of engaging\nwhat we call the action potential.\nThe action potential\nis the firing of electrical\nactivity by neurons.\nNow, neurons can engage\nelectrical activity\nin a number of different ways.\nThey have graded potentials.\nThey have gap junctions.\nThere's a whole landscape\nof different\nelectrophysiologies of neurons\nthat I don't want to go into just yet,\nat least not in this episode,\nbut the action potential\nis the fundamental way\nin which neurons communicate\nwith one another.\nThey're sometimes called spikes.\nIt's just kind of nomenclature\nthat neuroscientists use.\nI'm just going to briefly\ndescribe the action potential\nand the role that sodium plays,\nand this will involve a\nlittle bit of chemistry,\nbut I promise it will\nbe accessible to anyone,\neven if you don't have a\nchemistry or a physics background\nor electrophysiology background.\nNeurons have an inside and an outside,\nand inside are things like\nyour genetic material.\nThey have a bunch of things\nfloating around in there\nthat allow those cells to function,\nand they tend to have this\nwire extending out of them,\nsometimes a very long wire,\nsometimes a short one,\nthat we call the axon,\nand at the end of that wire, that axon,\nthey release little packets of chemicals\nthat either cause the next\nneuron to fire action potentials\nor prevent the next neuron\nfrom firing action potentials,\nso they kind of vomit out these\nlittle packets of chemicals\nthat either inspire or\nsuppress action potentials\nin other neurons.\nThe way that that whole process occurs\nis that a given neuron\nneeds to change its electrical activity,\nso normally, neurons are hanging out,\nand they have what we\ncall a negative charge,\nand the reason they have a negative charge\nis that the inside of the cell\nhas things floating around in it\nlike potassium, a little bit of sodium,\nand some stuff like chloride.\nThese are literally just,\njust imagine these as\nlittle balls of stuff,\nand if they have a\nnegative charge on them,\nthen the inside of the cell\nis going to tend to be more negative,\nand outside of the cell, it turns out,\nyou're going to have a bunch of stuff\nthat's positively charged,\nand one of the main factors\nin creating that positive\ncharge is sodium.\nSodium carries a positive charge,\nso you have neurons that\nyou can just imagine a,\nfor sake of this discussion,\nyou can just imagine as a sphere\nwith a little wire sticking out of it.\nYou can put a little minus\non the inside for negative.\nYou can put a little plus\non the outside for positive,\nand when that neuron is\nstimulated by another neuron,\nif the stimulation,\nthe electrical stimulation\nis sufficiently high,\nmeaning enough little\npackets of neurotransmitter\nhave been vomited onto its surface\nat sufficient concentration,\nwhat happens is little\npores, little spaces,\nlittle gaps open up in\nthe membrane of that cell\nthat separates the\ninside from the outside,\nand because it's positive,\nthere's a lot of positive charge outside,\nand there's a lot of negative inside,\nit's like a boulder running downhill.\nAll the stuff tends to rush downhill.\nIt tries to create even amounts of charge,\nso it's negative on the inside,\npositive on the outside,\nand what happens is sodium\nrushes into the cell\ncarrying a lot of charge into the cell,\nand as a consequence,\nthe charge of that cell\ngoes from negative,\nactually, very negative,\nto quite positive,\nand if it hits a certain\nthreshold of positive charge\nbecause of all the sodium\nions going into the cell,\nthen it fires what's\ncalled an action potential,\nand it vomits out its own set of chemicals\nonto the next neuron,\nand so it sets off a chain\nof one neuron goes from\nnegative to positive,\nblech, vomits out chemicals\nonto the next one.\nThe next one, the next neuron,\nthat binds to receptors\nor enters the cell,\nand that cell goes from\nnegative to positive charge,\n[imitates vomiting] vomits its\ncontents onto the next cell,\nand so on and so forth.\nSodium rushing into the cell, therefore,\nis the way that the action\npotential is stimulated.\nIn other words, sodium is the way\nthat neurons communicate with one another.\nNow, the neurons don't\nstay in a positive charge.\nOtherwise, they would just keep\nvomiting out their contents,\n[imitates vomiting], but they\nneed to maintain some of that,\nand they need to go back\nto preparing to do it the\nnext time and the next time\nby resting a bit,\nand turns out that the way\nthey restore their charge\nis by pushing that sodium\nback out of the cell.\nThere are mechanisms in place to do that,\nthings like the so-called\nsodium-potassium pump.\nThere's a change in the\nlevels of the potassium\nacross the cell membrane\nand so on and so forth.\nIf you want to look at\na demonstration of this,\nyou can just,\nyou can put into a web\nbrowser the action potential.\nYou'll find some beautiful\ndescriptions there\non YouTube and elsewhere.\nMaybe some time on Instagram,\nI'll do a description with a diagram\n'cause I realize\nnumber of people are\njust listening to this.\nI can't do that here.\nI won't do that here\n'cause I want everyone\nto be able to get the\nsame amount of material\nregardless of whether\nor not they're watching\nand/or listening to this,\nbut the point I'd like to make,\nat least as it relates\nto this episode on salt,\nis that having sufficient\nlevels of salt in your system\nallows your brain to function,\nallows your nervous\nsystem to function at all.\nAgain, this is the most basic aspect\nof nervous system function,\nand there are cases\nwhere this whole system gets disrupted,\nand that brings us to the topic\nof sodium and water balance.\nAs many of you have probably heard,\nbut hopefully, if you haven't,\nyou'll take this message seriously,\nif you drink too much water,\nespecially in a short amount of time,\nyou can actually kill yourself, right?\nAnd we certainly don't\nwant that to happen.\nIf you ingest a lot of water\nin a very short period of time,\nsomething called hypernatremia,\nyou will excrete a lot\nof sodium very quickly,\nand your ability to\nregulate kidney function\nwill be disrupted,\nbut in addition to that,\nyour brain can actually stop functioning,\nso people have actually\nconsumed water to excess,\nespecially after sports\nevents and so forth,\nand if that water doesn't\ncontain sufficient electrolytes,\nyou can actually shut\ndown neurons' ability\nto function at all\nby disrupting this balance\nof sodium and potassium\nand the amount of extracellular sodium\nand neurons' ability to\nsignal to one another\nthrough action potentials,\nand I can't emphasize the importance\nof action potentials enough.\nThey are the way that I\ncan lift my pen right now.\nThey're the way that I can speak.\nThey're the way that you breathe.\nThey literally control all aspects\nof your nervous system function.\nNow, it takes quite a lot of water intake\nbefore you excrete enough sodium\nthat your nervous system\nis going to shut down,\nand I certainly don't want\nto give the impression\nthat simply by ingesting more sodium,\nyour neurons will work better,\nbut it absolutely is the case\nthat if you don't ingest enough sodium,\nthat your neurons won't\nfunction as well as they could,\nand that if your sodium\nlevels are made too low\nby hemorrhage\nor by ingesting so much water, fluid,\nthat you excrete excess amounts of sodium\nor through any other mechanism, that is,\nthen indeed your neurons\nwon't be able to fire action potentials\nand your brain and nervous\nsystem simply won't work,\nand that's one of the primary\nreasons why dehydration\nleads to confusion and dizziness\nand lack of coordination,\nand I've talked about this a bit\nin the episode on endurance,\nbut there are instances\nin which competitive athletes\nhave come into the stadium\nto finish a final lap\nof a long endurance race\nand are completely disoriented\nand actually can't find\ntheir way to the finish line.\nIt might sound like kind\nof a silly, crazy example,\nbut there are examples\nof people having severe mental issues\nand physical issues post-exercise\nwhen that exercise\ninvolved a ton of sweating\nor hot environments\nor insufficient ingestion\nof fluids and electrolytes\nbecause included in the\nelectrolyte formula,\nof course, is sodium,\nand as you just learned,\nsodium is absolutely crucial\nfor neurons to function,\nso to briefly recap some of\nwhat I've talked about today,\nwe talked about how the brain\nmonitors the amount of salt\nin your brain and body\nand how that relates to thirst\nand the drive to consume more\nfluid and/or salty fluids.\nWe also talked a little\nbit about the hormones\nthat come from the brain\nand operate at the level of the kidney\nin order to either retain\nor allow water to leave your system.\nTalked a little bit about the\nfunction of the kidney itself,\na beautiful organ.\nWe talked about the relationship\nbetween salt intake and\nvarious health parameters\nand how a particular range of salt intake\nmight be optimal,\ndepending on the context\nin which that range is being consumed,\nmeaning depending on whether or not\nyou're hypertensive,\nprehypertensive, or normal tension.\nWe talked about fluid intake\nand electrolyte intake,\nso sodium, potassium, and magnesium\nin the context of athletic\nor sports performance,\nbut also, in terms of\nmaintaining cognitive function.\nTalked about the Galpin equation,\nwhich you could easily\nadapt to your body weight\nand to your circumstances.\nOf course, adjusting the amount of fluid\nand electrolyte intake upwards\nif you're exercising or working\nin very hot environments,\ndownwards, maybe, if you're\nin less hot environments\nwhere you're sweating less and so on.\nWe also talked about the relationship\nbetween the stress system\nand the salt craving system\nand why those two systems interact\nand why, for some people\nwho may suffer a bit\nfrom anxiety or under\nconditions of stress,\nincreasing salt intake,\nprovided it's done through healthy means,\nmight actually be beneficial.\nWe also talked about conditions\nin which increasing salt\nintake might be beneficial\nfor offsetting low blood pressure,\nand some of these postural syndromes\nthat can lead people to\ndizziness and so forth.\nThese are things that have to be explored\non an individual basis,\nand, of course, have to be explored\nwith the support of your doctor.\nI mentioned \"The Salt Fix,\"\nwhich I think is an interesting read,\nkeeping in mind that a lot\nof the information in there\nruns counter to the typical narrative\nthat you hear around salt,\nbut nonetheless, has some\nvery interesting points\nthat you might want to consider\nand certainly will broaden your view\nof the history of and\nthe applications of salt\nas it relates to a great number\nof health and performance metrics.\nWe also talked about\nthe perception of salt,\nmeaning the perception of salty tastes\nand how the perception of salty tastes\nand the perception of\nother tastes, like sweet,\ncan interact with one another\nto drive things like\nincreased sugar intake\nwhen you're not even aware of it,\nand indeed, how the combination\nof salty and sweet taste\ncan bias you towards craving more,\nfor instance, processed foods,\nand why that might be\na good thing to avoid,\nand, of course, we talked about salt\nand its critical role\nin the action potential,\nthe fundamental way\nin which the nervous\nsystem functions at all,\nso my hope for you, in\nlistening to this episode,\nis that you consider a question,\nand that question is\nwhat salt intake is best for you?\nAnd that you place that question\nin the context of your fluid intake,\nyou place that in the context\nof the diet you're following,\nthe amount of caffeine\nyou might be ingesting,\nand the diuretic effects of caffeine,\nand crucially, that you\nplace that in the context\nof the electrolytes, more generally,\nmeaning sodium, potassium, and magnesium.\nSomeday, there will be an online program\nor an app, I imagine,\nwhere one could put a bunch\nof different parameters in\nabout their particular health status,\ntheir particular diet, their\nparticular exercise, et cetera.\nMaybe it would all be run\nby AI algorithm or something\nwhere it would monitor all of that for us,\nand then it would spit out for us\na precise amount of sodium that\nwe should take in each day.\nUnfortunately, no such tool\nor device exists right now,\nand so all of us have to figure out\nthe appropriate amount of\nsodium intake for ourselves,\nand that has to be done\nunder these contextual considerations.\nWho knows?\nMaybe one of you will design\nsuch an app or such a device.\nI think it would be very useful.\nIf nothing else,\ntoday's discussion ought\nto illuminate the fact\nthat some strict\nrecommendation of salt intake\ncannot be made universally\nacross the board for everybody.\nThere's just simply no\nway that could be done,\nand yet, I think most of\nwhat we've learned about salt\nin the general discussions around health\nare that it's this evil substance.\nNothing could be further from the truth.\nIt's an incredible substance.\nOur physiology is dependent on it.\nOur cognition is dependent on it.\nIndeed, our mental and physical health\nand our performance in\nessentially all aspects of life\nis dependent on it,\nand I hope I've been able to illuminate\nsome of the beautiful ways\nin which the brain and\nthe bodily organs interact\nin order to help us regulate this thing\nthat we call sodium balance,\nand the fact that we\nhave neurons in our brain\nthat are both tuned to the\nlevels of salt in our body\nand positioned in a location in the brain\nthat allows them to detect\nthe levels of salt in our body\nand to drive the intake\nof more or less salt\nand more or less fluid\nand other electrolytes\nreally just points to\nthe beauty of the system\nthat we've all evolved\nthat allows us to interact\nwith our environment\nand make adjustments\naccording to the context of\nour daily and ongoing life.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific

everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like enhancing\nsleep and focus and so on.\nOne issue with supplements, however,\nis that the quality of\nsupplements varies tremendously\nfrom one brand to the next.\nFor that reason, we've partnered\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne supplements\nare of the absolute highest quality\nin terms of the ingredients they include\nand the precision of the amounts\nof the ingredients they include,\nmeaning what's listed on the bottle\nis what's actually\ncontained in that product.\nThey've partnered with\nall the major sports teams\nand with the Mayo Clinic,\nso trust is very, very high\nwith respect to the\nquality of Thorne products.\nIf you'd like to see the\nThorne supplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthat's thorne.com/u/huberman,\nand you can get 20% off any\nof those Thorne supplements.\nIn addition, if you navigate\ndeeper into the Thorne site\nthrough that portal,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\nThere, I cover science\nand science-based tools\nthat sometimes overlaps with\nthe content of this podcast,\nbut sometimes is distinct from\nthe content of this podcast.\nWe also have a \"Neural\nNetwork\" newsletter.\nThe \"Neural Network\" newsletter\ncomes out once a month.\nIt is zero cost.\nYou sign up for it by\nproviding your e-mail.\nWe do not share your e-mail with anybody.\nThe privacy policy is made very clear,\nand you can sign up for the\n\"Neural Network\" newsletter\nby going to hubermanlab.com,\njust going to the menu,\nscroll down to \"Neural\nNetwork,\" and you can sign up,\nand even without signing up,\nyou can access some of\nthe previous newsletters\nif you'd like to see what they are like.\nWe include short summaries from podcasts,\nsome key takeaways, and\nsome resources and tools\nthat you won't find anywhere else.\nThank you once again for joining me today\nto discuss the neuroscience\nand the physiology around salt\nand its many incredible\ninfluences on our brain and body,\nand last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[authoritative music]"
