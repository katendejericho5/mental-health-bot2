    "transcript": "- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is Dr. Justin Sonnenburg.\nDr. Sonnenburg is a\nprofessor of microbiology\nand immunology at Stanford\nSchool of Medicine,\nand one of the world's leading experts\non the gut microbiome.\nThe gut microbiome is the\nexistence of trillions\nof little microorganisms\nthroughout your gut,\nand by your gut, I don't\njust mean your stomach.\nI mean your entire digestive tract.\nTurns out we also have\na microbiome that exists\nin our nose, in any other\nlocation in which our body\ninterfaces with the outside world.\nIn fact, there's a\nmicrobiome on your skin.\nAnd while it might seem kind of intrusive,\nor kind of disgusting to have\nall these little microorganisms,\nthey can be immensely\nbeneficial for our health,\nmeaning our hormonal\nhealth, our brain health\nand our immune system function.\nDr. Sonnenburg teaches us\nabout the gut microbiome,\nhow it's organized spatially,\nmeaning which microbiota live where.\nHe teaches us about\nthese incredible things\ncalled crypts and niches,\nwhich are little caves\nwithin our digestive tract\nthat certain microbiota take residence.\nAnd at that premier real estate,\nthey're able to do incredible\nthings to support our health.\nHe also talks about the\nthings that we can all do\nto support our microbiome\nin order for our microbiome\nto support our brain and body health.\nDr. Sonnenburg co-runs his\nlaboratory with his spouse,\nDr. Erica Sonnenburg, and\ntogether they've also written\na terrific and highly\ninformative book called,\n\"The Good Gut: Taking\nControl of your Weight,\nyour Mood, and your Long Term Health.\"\nEven though that book was\nwritten a few years back,\nthe information still\nholds up very nicely.\nAnd today he also builds\non that information,\ninforming us about recent\nstudies, that for instance,\npoint to the important\nrole of fermented foods,\nand the role of fiber in supporting\na healthy gut microbiome.\nSo if you heard about the gut microbiome,\nor even if you haven't,\ntoday you're going to hear about it\nfrom one of the world's leading experts.\nHe makes it immensely\nclear as to what it is,\nhow it functions, and how to support it\nfor your brain and body health.\nDuring today's discussion,\nwe don't just talk about nutrition.\nWe also talk about the impact\nof behaviors and the microbiome.\nBehaviors such as who\nyou touch, who you kiss,\nwho you hug, whether or\nnot you interact with,\nor avoid animals,\nwhether or not those\nanimals belong to you,\nor whether or not they\nbelong to somebody else.\nIf all that sounds a little bit bizarre,\nyou'll soon understand\nthat your microbiome\nis constantly being modified\nby the behavioral interactions,\nthe nutritional interactions,\nand indeed your mood\nand internal reactions\nto the outside world.\nThis is an incredible\nsystem. Everyone has one.\nEveryone should know how it works,\nand everyone should\nknow how to optimize it.\nAnd today you're going to learn\nall of that from Dr. Sonnenburg.\nI'm pleased to announce that I'm hosting\ntwo live events in May, 2022.\nThe first live event will take place\nin Seattle, Washington on May 17th.\nThe second event will take place\nin Portland, Oregon on May 18th.\nBoth are part of a series called\n\"The Brain-Body Contract.\"\nFor this series, I will discuss science,\nso I will discuss the mechanistic science\naround things like sleep\nand focus and motivation,\nphysical performance, mental\nhealth, physical health,\na large number of topics that I believe\nmany people are interested in,\nand that certainly are important\nfor our health and\nwellbeing, and performance.\nIn addition, I will of\ncourse describe tools\nand actionable items, most\nof which I have not discussed\non The Huberman Lab\nPodcast, or anywhere else.\nPre-sale tickets for these two events\ngo live Tuesday, Match 8th\nat 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time.\nWe've made these tickets\nexclusively available\nto the listeners of The\nHuberman Lab Podcast.\nSo they are password protected.\nTo find them, you can go\nto hubermanlab.com/tour\nand use the code Huberman.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of my desire effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, now called AG1.\nI've been taking AG1 since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1,\nand the reason still take\nAG1 once or twice a day\nis that it meets all my basic,\nfoundational supplementation needs.\nWhat I mean by that is\nit covers any vitamin\nand nutritional deficiencies\nthat I might have,\n'cause I'm trying to be good\nabout my nutrition and diet,\nbut I don't always manage to\nget everything that I need,\nand I'm sure that there\nare a lot of gaps in there.\nSo it covers those gaps.\nIt also has probiotics,\nand as you'll learn\nin today's episode, and\nI've talked about it\non previous episodes,\nthe probiotics are essential\nfor a healthy gut microbiome.\nWe need probiotics in order\nfor our microbiome to thrive,\nand our microbiome supports\nthings like gut-brain health,\nindeed things like\nmetabolism, mood, hunger.\nIt also that supports the immune system.\nAs you'll learn today,\nyour gut microbiome actually\nmanufactures neurotransmitters,\nthe very chemicals that impact\nmood and brain function.\nAthletic Greens primes your system\nfor a healthy gut microbiome,\nsomething that can be achieved\nwith food and lifestyle factors,\nbut is often hard to achieve\nwith just food and lifestyle factors.\nIf you'd like to try out Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey give you five free travel packs\nthat make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nAnd a year's supply of vitamin D3 K2.\nvitamin D3 has many important\nbiological functions\nthat support your media\nand long term health,\nand K2 as well is very\nimportant for things\nlike cardiovascular health,\ncalcium regulation and so on.\nAgain, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim the special offer\nof the five free travel packs\nand the vitamin D3 K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that I believe\nare of the very highest quality.\nI've spent my lifetime working\non the biology of the visual system,\nand I can tell you that the\nbiology of the visual system\nhas a lot of mechanisms in there.\nSo that for instance, if you\nmove from a bright environment\nto a dim environment, your\nvisual system needs to adapt.\nOne issue with a lot of\nsunglasses and eyeglasses\nis you move from one\nenvironment to the next,\nyou have to take sunglasses\nor eyeglasses off,\nyou get a glare or you have to adjust\nbecause of the way that\nthe lenses are designed.\nWith ROKA, they've taken the\nbiology of the visual system\ninto account, and so you never\nhave to take them off and on\nin order to move from one\nenvironment to the next.\nThey are also designed for\nmovement and athletics,\nor you can wear them for\njust things like work,\nand going out to dinner and so forth.\nThey have a terrific aesthetic,\nthey're extremely lightweight.\nIn fact, I often forget that\nthey're even on my face.\nI wear sunglasses when it's very bright\nand when I'm driving into\nsunlight, I wear readers at night.\nI hardly ever remember\nthat they're on my face.\nThey also won't slip off your face\nif you use them when running or cycling.\nThe company was developed by two\nall-American swimmers from Stanford.\nSo everything about these\nsunglasses and eyeglasses\nwas developed with performance in mind,\nin a lot of different\nsituations and scenarios.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA,\nyou can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A .com,\nand enter the code huberman to save 20%\noff your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com,\nand enter the code huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are designed for your\nparticular sleep needs.\nWhat I mean by that is you\ncan go to the Helix site,\nyou can take a very brief\ntwo or three minute quiz,\nask questions like do\nyou sleep on your side,\nyour back, your stomach,\ndo you tend to run hot or\ncold through the night?\nMaybe you don't know the\nanswers to those questions.\nAnd then they match you to a mattress\nthat's designed for your\nparticular sleep needs.\nI matched to the Dusk, D-U-S-K, mattress.\nI like a mattress that's\nnot too firm, not too soft.\nI tend to sleep on my side,\nor sort of in the\ncrawling soldier position.\nSeems to be the the most\ncommon position I sleep in.\nAnd that really works\nterrifically well for me.\nBut you need to take the quiz\nto see which mattress works best for you.\nSo if you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake the two quiz and they'll match you\nto a customized mattress.\nYou can figure out how to\nget your optimal sleep,\nwhich was talked about on this podcast\nso many times before.\nSleep is the foundation of all\nmental and physical health,\nand performance in any aspect of life.\nSleep is key, and the\nmattress you sleep on is key\nto the sleep you get.\nAfter matching you do\na customized mattress,\nyou can get up to $200\noff any mattress order\nand two free pillows.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou can go to heli sleep.com/huberman\nto get up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg.\nJustin, thanks so much for being here.\n- Great to be here.\n- Yeah.\nI am a true novice when it\ncomes to the microbiome,\nso I'd like to start off\nwith a really basic question,\nwhich is, what is the microbiome?\nI imagine lots of little\nbugs running around in my gut\nand I don't quite like the image of that,\nbut I'm aware that our\nmicrobiome can be good for us,\nbut we can also have an\nunhealthy microbiome.\nSo if I were to look at\nthe microbiome at the scale\nthat I could see the meaningful things,\nwhat would it look like, and\nwhat's going on in there?\n- Yeah, I mean essentially you're correct.\nI mean, we have all of\nthese little microorganisms\nrunning around in our gut.\nI think, just to start off\nwith clarifying terminology,\nmicrobiome and microbiota\nquite often are referred to,\nor used to refer to our microbial\ncommunity interchangeably,\nand I'll probably switch\nbetween those two terms today.\nThe other important thing to\nrealize is that these microbes\nare not just in our gut, but\nthey're all over our body.\nThey're in our nose,\nthey're in our mouths,\nthey're on our skin.\nAnd so basically anywhere that\nthe environment can get to\nin our body, which includes\ninside our digestive tract,\nof course, is colonized with microbes.\nAnd the vast majority of these\nare in our distal gut and in our colon,\nand so this is the gut\nmicrobiota or gut microbiome.\nAnd the density of this\ncommunity is astounding.\nI mean, it really is.\nIf you get down to the\nscale of being able to see\nindividual microbes, you start\noff with a zoomed out view\nand you see something that\nlooks like fecal material\nthat digest inside the\ngut, and you zoom in,\nand you start to get to\nthe microscopic level\nand see the microbes.\nThey are just packed\nside to side, end to end.\nIt's a super dense bacterial community,\nalmost like a biofilm,\nsomething that's just made up of microbes,\nto the point where it's\nthought that around 30%\nof fecal matter is microbes, 30 to 50%.\nSo it's an incredibly\ndense microbial community,\nwe're talking of trillions\nof microbial cells.\nAnd all those microbial cells,\nif you start to get to know\nthem, and see who they are,\nbreak out in the gut probably to hundreds,\nto 1,000 species, depending upon\nhow you define microbial species.\nAnd then most of these are bacteria,\nbut there are a lot of\nother life forms there.\nThere are archaea, which\nare little microbes\nthat are bacterial-like,\nbut they're different.\nThere are eukaryotes.\nSo we commonly think of\neukaryotes in the gut\nas something like a parasite.\nBut there are eukaryotes,\nthere are fungi, there\nare also little viruses.\nThere are these bacteriophages\nthat infect bacterial cells.\nAnd those actually outnumber\nthe bacteria, like 10 to one.\nSo they're just everywhere\nthere, they kill bacteria.\nAnd so there's these really interesting\npredator/prey interactions.\nBut overall, it's just this really dense,\ncomplex, dynamic ecosystem.\nAnd so, we're talking about\nthe human as a single species,\nbut we're also thinking of\nthe human as this complex,\nintegrated ecosystem of hundreds\nto thousands of species,\ninteracting concert to do\nall the fantastic things\nthat we know happen in the human body.\n- Amazing. So we've got a lot of cargo.\nOr maybe we're the cargo.\n- Yeah.\n- Who knows?\n- Yeah, I mean,\nthere have been people\nthat have likened humans\nto just a really elaborate\nculturing flask for microbes,\nand that we've actually been designed\nover the course of evolution,\ndesigned to just efficiently propagate\nthis microbial culture\nfrom person to person,\nfrom generation to generation.\nSo it's a different way of\nthinking of the human body.\n- Interesting.\nI believe that our pH or the\npH of our digestive system\nvaries as you descend,\nas you go from mouth\nto throat and stomach.\nAnd you said that most of the microbiota\nare in the distal colon.\nAre there distinct forms\nof microbiota all along\nthe length of the digestive tract,\nand within these other interfaces\nwith the outside world?\n- Totally. Yeah.\nSo it starts with our\nteeth and in our mouth,\nand saliva, there's a oral microbiota.\nThese microbial species are very different\nthan the ones that you find\nin the digestive tract.\nThey're usually built to\ndeal with oxygen very well.\nThey're in an area that is\nexposed to a lot of oxygen,\nthey of course see different\nnutrients than, for instance,\nthe colonic bacteria would see.\nAnd they grow quite often\nin mats that live on teeth.\nSo they're very structured in terms of...\nAnd not moving around a lot.\nSo they're very, fairly stationary.\nAs you move down the digestive tract,\nthere are microbes in\nesophagus in our stomach,\nbut those communities are not very dense,\nand actually not very well studied.\nWe know of a very...\nThere's a very famous stomach bacteria\nknown as Helicobacter pylori,\nwhich can cause stomach ulcers\nand cause gastric cancer\nin some less frequent situations.\nBut this is\na very different set of\nmicrobes, they have to be adapted\nto a different environment,\nin the stomach especially,\nincredibly acidic environment.\nBut also very different in terms\nof their ability to interact\nwith other microbes,\njust because the\ncommunities are less dense,\nthey're less dynamic, there's\nless nutrients that stay there\nand passage through the community.\nSo a lot of times those communities\nare reliant upon nutrients\nderived from the host,\nas opposed to nutrients\nderived from our diet.\nAs you move down out of the stomach,\ninto the small intestine,\nyou start to see these communities,\nwhich are the ones that are\nbecoming more well-studied.\nSmall intestine is still\na bit of a black box,\njust because it's hard to access.\nAnd so there's some really\ncool technologies out there\nfor using, for instance,\ncapsules to do sampling\nas the capsule passes\nthrough the digestive tract,\nso that we have a better\nidea of what's going on\nin the small intestine.\nAnd then you get to the colon,\nand this is the community\nthat's just so incredibly\ndensely packed, doing a ton of...\nThere's a ton of metabolic\nactivity happening there,\nand a bunch of interaction with the host.\nAnd that's the community\nthat's really the best studied.\nPart of the reason for\nthat is because stool\nis so easy to obtain\ncompared to, for instance,\nsomething in the stomach\nor small intestine.\nAnd that stool is fairly\nrepresentative, we know,\nfrom studies that have been done\nusing colonoscopies and so forth.\nStool is fairly representative\nof what's happening in the colon.\nSo dense, super exciting community,\nbut also the best studied,\njust because it's the easiest to access\nin the lower digestive tract.\n- Very interesting.\nI imagine these microbiota\nhave to get in there\nat some point, are\nmicrobiota seen in newborns?\nIn other words, where do they come from?\nAnd dare I ask, what direction\ndo they enter the body?\nOr is it from multiple directions?\n- Yeah, yeah. Great question.\nSo one of the burning questions\nthat we can come back to\nat the end of this, is where\ndoes our microbiota come from?\nBecause it is this kind of\nexistential question in the field,\nlike where is this\ncommunity assembling from?\nAnd the reason that it's\nsuch an interesting question\nis that, a fetus, when it's in the womb,\nthat's actually a sterile environment.\nThere have been some\nstudies that have looked\nat whether there are microbes in the womb,\nand microbes colonizing\nthe fetus at that point.\nThere's some debate about this,\nbut overall it looks like that's not a big\npart of the equation of\nmicrobial colonization.\nAnd so each time I'm an infant is born,\nit's this new ecosystem.\nIt's like an island\nrising up out of the ocean\nthat has no species on it,\nand suddenly there's this land rush\nfor this open territory.\nAnd so we know that infants go through\nthis really complex process\nof microbiota assembly\nover the first days, weeks,\nmonths, years of life.\nAnd then you get into\nswitching to solid food,\ntwo to three years of age.\nThere are some changes in\nchildhood, adolescence,\nworking into adulthood.\nBut that first zero to one year\nis a super dynamic time\nwith really kind of\nstereotypical developmental changes\nin the gut microbiota, that\nappear to have the possibility\nof going wrong and causing\nproblems for infants\nin some instances.\nBut if you step away\nfrom that extreme side\nof things going wrong,\nthere also were a lot of\ndifferent trajectories\nthat developmental process can take,\nbecause our microbiota is\nso malleable and so plastic,\nand those trajectories can be affected\nby all sorts of factors in early life.\nSo an example is whether an infant is born\nby C-section or born vaginally.\nWe know from beautiful work\nthat's been done in the field\nthat infants that are born by C-section\nactually have a gut microbiota that looks\nmore like human skin than it does\nlike either the birth canal,\nthe vagina microbiota,\nor the mother's stool microbiota.\nBabies that are born\nthrough the birth canal\nhave initial colonization\nof vaginal microbes\nand of stool microbes from their mother.\nAnd so just these first days,\nwhether you're born by C-section\nor through natural childbirth,\nyour gut microbiota looks very different.\nAnd then compound on top of that,\nwhether you're breast fed or formula fed,\nwhether your family has a\npet or doesn't have a pet,\nwhether you're exposed to antibiotics,\nthere are all these factors that really\ncan change that developmental process,\nand really change your microbial identity,\neventually in life.\nThe reason that the field is\npaying really close attention\nto this and studying this right now\nis because we know from animal studies,\nthat depending upon the microbes\nthat you get early in life,\nyou can send the immune\nsystem or metabolism\nof an organism or other\nparts of their biology\nin totally different\ndevelopmental trajectories.\nSo what microbes you're\ncolonized with early in life\ncan really change your biology,\nand we can come back to that later, but-\n- Yeah, we should.\n- Getting back to that original question\nof where do your microbes come from,\nyou'd think because you're born\nthrough your mother's birth canal,\nor exposed to her skin microbes,\nthat a lot of your microbes\nwould come from your mother,\nbut it actually turns out that,\nwe can certainly detect that signal,\nwe certainly see maternal\nmicrobes in the infant,\nbut there are a lot of\nmicrobes that are coming\nfrom other places, surfaces, other people,\nperhaps other caregivers, but\nperhaps strangers as well.\nSo we acquire our microbes\nfrom a variety of sources.\nThe first ones are from our mom,\nor from our caregivers from the hospital,\nbut then we add to that tremendously\nover the first year or so of life.\n- Incredible, you even said pets.\nSo if there's a dog in the\nhome or a parakeet in the home,\nclearly they have a microbiome also,\nand potentially the child\nis deriving microbiota\nspecies from those pets, correct?\n- Exactly, yeah.\nAnd so the best studies\nthat have been done\nhave just looked at pets in\nthe household as a factor,\nand whether that changes\nthe group of infants\nthat have a pet to look slightly different\nthan the group of infants\nthat don't have a pet.\nAnd then the question is,\nwhat is the pet doing to\nchange those microbes?\nAnd some of it is probably\nactually contributing,\ndirect members of the microbiota.\nActually, I have a dog,\nthat dog occasionally\nwill lick my mouth without\nme paying attention,\nand that's probably introducing microbes.\nWe also know that pets\nare down in the dirt,\nthey're outside, they're being exposed\nto a lot of environmental microbes.\nAnd so just pets serving as a conduit\nfor a bunch of microbes\nthat we wouldn't otherwise\ncome in contact with is\na possibility as well.\n- Well, we will return to pets,\nand in particular your dog,\nan amazing dog, by the way.\nI met your dog just the other day,\nand I had to force myself,\nI had to pry myself away from...\nIt's a Havanese, right?\n- Havanese.\n- [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.\nWhat is your dog's name?\n- Louis. Louis Pasteur.\n- Louis Pasteur.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- How appropriate.\nAmazing dog, what a personality\non that dog.\n- Yeah.\n- The issue that I think\na lot of people are probably wondering is,\nwhat is a healthy microbiome?\nWhat is it supporting?\nWe hear that you need a healthy microbiome\nto support the immune\nsystem or metabolism,\nor even the gut-brain axis.\nHow do we define a healthy,\nversus a unhealthy microbiome?\nSome people might know\nthe unhealthy microbiome\nis dysbiosis is the word that\nI encounter in the literature.\nBut given that there's so\nmany species of microbiota,\nand given that I think we\nprobably each have a signature\npattern of microbiota,\nhow do we define healthy\nversus unhealthy microbiota?\nIs there a test for this?\nLater we'll talk about technologies\nfor testing microbiota.\nThere are a lot of companies now,\na lot of people sending\nstool samples in the mail.\nNever look at the Postal\nService the same way again,\nbut it's out there and\nit's getting analyzed.\nSo how should I think about this?\nI can think about things like heart rate,\nheart rate variability, BMI,\nall sorts of metrics of health.\nHow should I think about the microbiota?\nHow do I know if my microbiome\nis healthy or unhealthy?\n- Yeah, it's a million\ndollar question right now\nin the field, and there's\na lot of different ways\nof thinking about that, and I\ncan talk about some of those.\nBut I would say that there\nare sessions at conferences,\nthere are review articles\nbeing commissioned.\nThere are all sorts of thought\npieces about this right now,\nlike what is a healthy microbiota?\nWhat are the features that define it?\nAnd I think before diving into this,\nthe important thing to realize\nis, it's a complex topic.\nContext matters a lot.\nWhat's healthy for one\nperson or one population\nmay not be healthy for\nanother person or population.\nAnd the microbiota is malleable.\nIt's plastic, it changes\nour human biology,\nwhich I think is, how we think\nabout health quite often,\nBMI and longevity, reproductive success,\nhowever you want to define it.\nIt certainly can accommodate a variety\nof configurations of gut\nmicrobiota, and we don't have...\nIt's really hard to untangle\nall of the different factors\nof what could be very healthy,\nversus a little bit less healthy.\nSo I will say that there's\nno single answer to this,\nbut there's some really\nimportant considerations.\nAnd perhaps the best way\nto start talking about this\nis to go back to the inception\nof the Human Microbiome Project,\nwhich was this program that NIH started.\nThey invested a lot of money in 2008, 2009\nfor really propelling the field\nof gut microbiome research.\nIt was becoming evident at that point\nthat this was not just a\ncuriosity of human biology,\nthat it was probably really\nimportant for our health.\nAnd they had all this\nwonderful sequencing technology\nfrom the Human Genome Sequencing Project,\nand with the human genome\ncompleted that point,\nthey started turning that technology\nto sequencing our gut microbes.\nAnd it's important to contextualize\nthe amount of information that\nthey're trying to document,\nthe collective genome of our\ngut microbes is on the order\nof 100 to 500 times larger\nthan our human genome.\nSo it's just in terms\nof the number of genes.\nSo it's just this vast number of genes,\nand then if you start getting into\nsome of the fine variation,\nit's scales by 10 to a 100 fold.\nSo really a huge amount information\nthey're trying to document.\nAnd so it was a wonderful investment,\nand it continues to pay\ndividends to this day.\nBut one of their goals of that\nproject was to try to define\nwhat a healthy microbiome is,\nversus a diseased microbiome\nin different contexts.\nAnd so they started enrolling\na bunch of healthy people\nand a bunch of people with, for instance,\ninflammatory bowel disease\nand other diseases.\nAnd the idea was, let's\ndocument those microbiomes.\nWhat microbes are there,\nwhat genes are there?\nAnd then we can start to get a sense of,\nwhat are the commonalities\nof the healthy people,\nand how can that go wrong in\nthese different disease states?\nThere were some answers from that,\nbut through those studies,\nwe really started to get the image\nthat there is this\ntremendous individuality\nin the gut microbiome.\nAnd so it's really hard to\nstart drawing conclusions\nafter initial pass of that project,\nof what is a healthy microbiome?\nBut the other thing that\nwe started to realize\nat the same time, there\nwere studies going on\ndocumenting the gut microbiome\nof traditional populations\nof humans, hunter-gatherers,\nrural agricultural populations.\nAnd those studies were really mind-blowing\nfrom the perspective of all\nthese people are healthy,\nthey're living very different lifestyles,\nand their microbiome doesn't look anything\nlike a healthy American microbiome.\n- So does that mean that the\nhealthy American microbiome\nis healthy, but only in\nthe context of living\nin the United States and\nconsuming what's consumed here?\nOr is it that there is a\nsuperior microbiome signature,\nsomewhere in our history\nor currently in the world?\n- Yeah, I think that's kind\nof a big question right now.\nI think there's a great quote\nfrom Dobzhansky that says,\n\"Nothing in biology makes sense,\nexcept in the light of evolution.\"\nAnd these traditional\npopulations are all modern people\nliving on the planet now,\nbut their lifestyle does represent\nthe closest approximation\nto how our ancestors, early humans lived.\nAnd so those microbiomes,\nand now we know from\nsequencing of paleofeces,\nthe microbiome of these\ntraditional populations\nis more representative of the microbiome\nthat we evolved with,\nthat potentially shaped\nour human genome.\nAnd so one possibility is\nthat in industrialized world,\nwe have a different microbiome\nfrom traditional populations,\nand that microbiome is well-adapted\nto our current lifestyle,\nand therefore healthy\nin the context of an\nindustrialized society.\nAnd there probably are\nelements of that that are true.\nBut another possibility is\nthat this is a microbiome\nthat's gone off the rails,\nthat it is deteriorating in\nthe face of antibiotic use,\nand all the problems associated\nwith an industrialized diet, Western diet.\nAnd that even though the\nHuman Microbiome Project\ndocumented the microbiome\nof healthy people,\nhealthy Americans, that what they really\nmay have been documenting\nthere is a perturbed microbiota\nthat's really predisposing\npeople to a variety\nof inflammatory and metabolic diseases.\n- It reminds me, as a neurobiologist,\nwas weaned in the landscape\nof so-called critical periods,\nwhere early life environment\nvery strongly shapes the brain.\nAnd so many studies were\ndone on animals raised\nin traditional cages with a\nwater bottle and some food,\nmaybe a few other animals\nof the same species.\nAnd then people came along and said, wait,\nnormally these species in\nthe wild would have things\nlike things to climb over\nand things to go through,\nand you provide those very basic elements,\nand all of a sudden the\narchitecture of neural circuits\nlooks very different, and you realize\nthat were studying a deprived condition.\nAnd earlier you actually referred to,\nif I understood correctly,\nto critical periods\nfor gut microbiome development.\nIs it fair to say that\nthere are critical periods?\nMeaning, if let's say my...\nLet's aim it at me.\nIf my gut microbiome was dysbiotic,\nit was off early in\nlife, can I rescue that\nthrough proper conditions and exercise?\nOr is there some sort of fixed pattern\nthat's going to be hard\nfor me to escape from?\n- Yeah, there's a big\nfield that's emerging now\nthat we refer to as kind of reprogramming\nthe gut microbiome.\nAnd I think if we want\nto conceptualize humans\nas this aggregate human microbial biology,\nmost people have heard of CRISPR,\nand the ability to potentially\nchange our human genome\nin ways that correct genetic problems.\nThat's a wonderful technology,\nand has kind of put\non the table genetic\nengineering for cur disease,\nbut it's much easier to change\ngut microbes for a problem,\njust because that community is malleable.\nThe issue that I think\nwe're seeing in the field\nis that microbiomes quite often,\nwhether they're diseased or healthy,\nexist in stable states.\nThey kind of tend towards this\nwell that has gravity to it\nin a way, biological gravity,\nwhere it's really hard to dislodge\nthat community from that state.\nSo even individuals, for\ninstance, that get antibiotics.\nYou take oral antibiotics,\nthe community takes this huge hit.\nWe know that a bunch of microbes die,\nthe composition changes.\nAnd that represents a\nperiod of vulnerability\nwhere pathogens can come in and\ntake over and cause disease.\nBut if that doesn't happen,\nthe microbiota kind of works\nits way back to something\nthat is not exactly like,\nbut similar to the\npre-antibiotic treatment.\nWe know with dietary perturbations,\nquite often you'll see\na really rapid change\nto the gut microbiome.\nAnd then it's almost like a\nmemory where it snaps back\nto something that's very\nsimilar to the original state,\neven though the diet remains different.\nAnd so there's this incredible,\nwhat we refer to as resilience\nof the gut microbiome,\nand resistance to change,\nor at least resistance to\nestablishing a new stable state.\nSo that doesn't mean it's hopeless\nto change an unhealthy microbiome\nto a healthy microbiome,\nbut it does mean that we\nneed to think carefully\nabout restructuring\nthese communities in ways\nwhere we can achieve a new\nstable state that will resist\nthe microbial community\ngetting pulled back\nto that original state.\nAnd one of the really\nsimplest and nicest examples\nof this an experiment that\nwe performed with mice,\nwhere we were feeding\nmice a normal mouse diet,\na lot of nutrients there\nfor the gut microbiota,\nthings like dietary fiber.\nAnd we switched those mice, half the mice,\nto a low fiber diet.\nAnd we were basically asking the question\nthat if you switch to kind\nof a Western-like diet,\na low fiber, higher fat diet,\nwhat happens to the gut microbiota?\nAnd we saw the microbiota\nchange, it lost diversity.\nIt was very similar to what\nwe see in the difference\nbetween industrialized and\ntraditional populations.\nBut when we brought back a healthy diet,\na lot of the microbes\nreturned, it was fairly...\nThere was this kind of\nmemory where it went back\nto very similar to its original state.\nThe difference is that\nwhen we put the mice\non the low fiber, high fat diet,\nand then kept them on that\nfor multiple generations,\nwe saw this progressive deterioration\nover the course of generations\nwhereby the fourth generation,\nthe gut microbiome was a fraction\nof what it originally was.\nLet's say 30% of the species only remained\nsomething like 70% of the\nspecies had gone extinct,\nor appeared to have gone extinct.\nWe then put those mice back\nonto a high fiber diet,\nand we didn't see recovery.\nSo in that case, it's a situation\nwhere a new stable state\nhas been achieved.\nIn that case, it's\nprobably because those mice\ndon't actually have access\nto the microbes that they've lost.\nAnd we actually know that we\ndid the control experiment\nof mice on a high fiber\ndiet for four generations.\nThey maintain all their microbes.\nIf we take those fourth generation mice\nwith all the diversity\nand do a fecal transplant\ninto the mice that had\nlost their microbes,\nbut had been returned\nto a high fiber diet,\nall of the diversity was reconstituted.\nSo your question of like,\nhow do we establish new stable states?\nHow do we get back to a healthy microbiota\nif we have taken a lot of antibiotics,\nor have a deteriorated microbiota,\nit's probably a combination\nof having access\nto the right microbes.\nAnd we can talk about what\nthat access looks like.\nIt may look like\ntherapeutics in the future.\nThere are a lot of companies\nworking on creating cocktails\nof healthy microbes.\nBut it'll be a combination of\naccess to the right microbes\nand nourishing those microbes\nwith the proper diet.\n- Very interesting.\nThis multi-generational\nstudy reminds me of something\nthat I was told early in my training,\nwhich was that it takes a long\ntime for a trait to evolve,\nbut not a long time for traits to devolve.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- Which generally is true\nof human behavior too,\nalthough it depends.\nWe can all do better, nonetheless.\n- [Justin Sonnenburg] Very interesting.\n- So I have a puzzle\nor a bit of a conundrum\naround this notion of\nspecies of microbiota.\nSo if the pH, if the acidity\ndiffers along the digestive tract,\nbut is more or less fixed\nfor a given location, right?\nI mean, unless something's really off,\nthe pH of the stomach is\nwithin a particular range,\nand the intestines and so forth.\nAnd certain microbiota\nthrive at a given station,\na given location along\nthe digestive tract,\nand the pH is sort of fixed more or less.\nI'm trying to figure out,\nwhat is allowing certain microbiota\nto stay in a given location?\nWhy don't they migrate up or down?\nSo are they pH sensitive,\nand that's what they're\nselecting for along the tract?\nAnd I'm also trying to figure\nout how these changes in food\nso robustly change the microbiome.\nThe way you describe it\nalmost makes it sound\nlike food is the variable\nthat's going to dictate\nthe quality of the microbiome,\nalthough I'm sure there\nare other factors as well.\nAnd then in the back of my mind,\nI don't know that I want\nto ask this question,\nbut I really want to ask this question,\nwhich is, where are they in there exactly,\nand why don't they all get flushed out?\nRight?\n- Right.\n- If 30% of fecal matter is microbiota,\nthen where are they living?\nAre they along the lining,\nand the little microvilli\nof the intestine, and\nwhat are they attaching to\nand interacting with?\nwe know there are neurons in there,\nespecially within the stomach,\nthere's a lot of work now being done\non the gut neurons and how they signal\nto the brain and so forth.\nBut who are they talking to in terms\nof the host cells?\n- Yeah.\n- Because if it's just from food,\nI imagine that they're in\nthere having their good time,\nor not, and then some are\ngetting flushed out or not,\nbut how do they actually stay in there?\n- Yeah.\n- Who are they attaching to?\nWhat are they talking about?\nWhat are they doing for fun?\n- Yeah.\n- And so forth.\n- Yeah, yeah. Super interesting.\nSo I'll come back to\nthe attachment question,\nand kind of why they don't get washed out,\n'cause this is a super\nfascinating question.\nAnd I think your initial point of like,\nthe kind of regional\ndifferences in what's happening\nin terms of physiology, biochemistry\nalong the length of the\ngut is really interesting.\nThere certainly is a pH gradient\nalong the length of the gut.\nThere is actually\nbicarbonate that's secreted\ninto the small intestine to\ntry to neutralize stomach acid.\nThere also is bile that's secreted.\nThat creates a different\nchemical environment in there,\nbio-loving bacteria that kind of live\nin that region of the gut.\nAnd then there is a nutrient gradient,\njust because as food leaves the stomach,\na lot of the simple\nnutrients are absorbed.\nAnd so you might see microbes\nin the small intestine,\nfor instance, that are better\nat consuming simple sugars,\nbut you won't find many\nmicrobes in the colon like that,\nbecause all the simple sugars\nhave been depleted at that point.\nAnd then the immune system\nis a big factor as well.\nAnd the immune system is incredibly active\nin the small intestine.\nThe small intestine is\nthis really interesting\nchallenge for the host, because\nit's a tissue that's been...\nIts purpose is mainly absorptive.\nAnd so there has to be\nflow of a lot of things,\na lot of nutrients from\nthe luminal contents\ninto host cells.\nAnd so that means the barrier\ncan't be as fortified.\nAnd so the immune system\nis incredibly active\nin the small intestine to\nmake sure that microbes\naren't getting so close, and\nif they are getting close,\nthere's a response to\nthem to put them back\nin their right location.\nAnd then along this whole kind\nof architecture of the gut,\nthere's the longitudinal gradients,\nthings like pH and so forth.\nAnd I should say that pH starts\nto drop again in the colon,\nbecause a lot of those\nmicrobes are fermenting things\nand producing acids.\nAnd so you actually end up\nwith the pH starting to drop,\nnot as low as the stomach,\nbut starting to drop again\nif there's a lot of fermentation\nhappening in the colon.\nIn addition, you also have a gradient\nfrom the host surface epithelium\nout to the middle of the gut.\nAnd that is likely the key for\nwhat is retained in the gut\nand how the community isn't washed out.\nSo lining the gut, we\nhave epithelial cells.\nIn the small intestine,\nthey're largely absorbative.\nIn the colon, there's a\nlot of mucus production.\nAnd we also see this\nin the small intestine,\nand this mucus lining is this\nsubstance that we secrete,\nlargely made of carbohydrate actually.\nAnd the purpose of that\nis to keep microbes\nin the right spot and to allow nutrients\nand water to be absorbed\nin the small intestine\nand large intestine.\nAnd so it's this mesh\nwork that is supposed\nto keep out large things\nlike back to and lead,\nand small things like nutrients.\nThat mucus layer is, it\nturns over more slowly\nthan the luminal contents passing by.\nAnd so if a microbe learns to\nhold onto that mucus layer,\nit can actually resist the flow\nof the contents of the gut.\nAnd so there there's\nmany microbes in the gut\nthat are not just good\nat attaching to mucus,\nbut also good at nibbling\non it, at eating it.\nAnd there are these bacteria,\nlike Akkermansia\nmuciniphila, mucus-loving.\nOne of its main things it\ndoes is actually eat mucus\nin the gut, that's its lifestyle.\nAnd so there's an incredible\ngradient of activity\nfrom the host tissue,\nworking your way out to\nthe middle of the gut.\nWhat's amazing is some microbes actually\ndo penetrate past the mucus,\nand there are these invaginations\nin the intestine known as crypts,\nactually where the stem cells live\nthat produce the epithelium,\nand there are microbial communities\nthat can form in those crypts.\nAnd we don't know completely\nwhat their function is,\nbut we've done some studies\nthat appear to indicate\nthat if you can localize to a crypt,\nyou've hit the jackpot as a microbe\nfor being able to maintain\ndominance in the gut.\nSo if you sit in the crypt\nand something similar to you,\nanother microbe that's similar\nto you, comes into the gut,\nyou can actually exclude that microbe.\nAnd the thinking is that\nit can't find a spot\nto resist being washed out of the gut.\nSo there probably are these little niches\nclose to host tissue in the mucus\nthat are absolutely essential\nfor resisting getting washed out\nwith the flow of all the contents.\n- Incredible.\nThat raises a question about two things\nthat are reasonably popular.\nOne is this notion of cleanses,\nfrom either direction.\nPeople will consume things by mouth to try\nand cleanse their digestive tract.\nThis there's a long history of this.\nI'm not recommending this.\nThere's differing\nopinions on whether or not\nthis is good or bad.\nAnd the other is fasting\nor time-restricted feeding.\nThe reason I ask about\ntime-restricted feeding,\nis my understanding is\nthat after a prolonged\nperiod of fasting, there's\nsome auto-absorption\nor digestion of one's own digestive tract,\nthat then gets renewed.\nIn other words, you're testing and stomach\nstart eating its own lining to some extent\nin the absence of food.\nSo what do we know about cleanses?\nOh, and then I suppose there's cleanses\nfrom the other direction too, right?\nWhich, less popular, but I've\nnever run the statistics,\nbut certainly exist out there.\nWhat's the idea about cleanses and fasting\nas it relates to the\nhealth or the dysbiosis\nof the microbiota?\n- Yeah, there hasn't been a\nlot of high quality science\nin this area, and so it's\nreally hard to conclude\nwhether these are good for\nhealth or bad for health.\nI think the fasting...\nWe're in a really interesting situation\nin the industrialized world,\nbecause we have so many problems\nassociated with our digestive tract,\nand that probably has to do\nwith our highly processed diet\nand perhaps having a microbiota\nthat's fairly perturbed as well.\nAnd so,\nwhether doing things like\nthis are good or bad,\nit's really hard to define,\nbecause we may be starting off\nin a fairly bad state anyway.\nThere's so many diseases\nthat we're dealing with,\nmetabolic syndrome,\ninflammatory bowel disease,\nthat just put a massive\nportion of the population\nin a very different category\nthan people that are thinking\nabout how do I maintain health,\nhow do I live a long life,\nfrom starting off in what we consider\na fairly healthy state.\nAnd so things like fasting\nand a lot of other therapies\nthat have been developed in the field,\nI think ketogenic diet may\nbe in this category as well.\nThere can be tremendous benefits\nin terms of their impact\nin the context of metabolic syndrome,\nand for people that are battling\neating a continual bad diet\nor something like that.\n- And adherence.\nI think one of the one of the\nreasons for the popularity\nof intermittent fasting,\ntime-restricted feeding,\nand what do they call them now?\nExclusion diets, where you\nentire entirely exclude meat,\nor you entirely exclude\nplants or whatever it is,\nis that adherence is sometimes\neasier in the all or none.\nAs neurobiologists, we think\nof it as a go, no-go circuitry.\nIt's harder to make decisions,\nnuanced decisions often,\nabout food than it is\nto just eliminate entire\ncategories of food.\nNot eating, for many people-\n- Yeah.\n- Is easier than eating smaller portions.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nYeah, and-\n- Yeah.\nSo some of it, I think,\nis neurobiological and psychological.\n- Absolutely.\nAnd we've had gastroenterology\nfellows in our lab\nthat come in and we kind of...\nI think that to kind of\nslice through the nuance\nof all this, there's a very simple recipe\nand a really well\naccepted, broad definition\nof what a healthy diet is.\nkind of the Mediterranean\ndiet, plant-based diet is...\nThere's just a ton of data\nthat particularly people\nof European ancestry, but\nthere's a pretty broad acceptance\nthat if you eat mostly\nplants, for most people,\nthat's going to be very\nhealthy, to the point where...\nA wonderful colleague of\nours, Christopher Gardner,\nwho's studied diet his whole life,\ntrying to establish\nwhat a healthy diet is.\nAnd people was giving advice,\nI saw him giving advice\nto a dietician who is\ntrying to get all the rules\nof what she should be\nrecommending to people\nthat she deals with that are\ninterested in a healthy diet.\nAnd she said, so the number\none, I'm going to say,\nplant-based fiber is\nprobably super important,\nand that should be very high on the list.\nAnd she goes on to number\ntwo and he said, stop.\nHe said, if people do number one well,\nyou don't need to know any other rules.\nI mean, it's basically\nlike if you can have\na high fiber, plant-based diet,\nfor most people, at least,\ntalking about the bucket of people\nthat are already in a healthy state,\nyou don't really need to\nthink about other things,\nbecause you can't eat too much meat,\nyou can't eat too many sweets.\nYou've already eaten a huge\namount of plant-based fiber.\nYour gut is full, you're\nnot going to be hungry.\nAnd it kind of takes care of worrying\nabout what should I eat or\nwhat, what shouldn't I eat.\nJust eat a ton of whole\ngrains, legumes, vegetables,\nfruit that's high fiber\nbased, not high sugar.\n- Does it completely exclude\nmeat, and fish and dairy?\n- And he was saying people can\nadd their own spins on this.\nBut I think that the main\nrule is just start off with...\nAnd it kind of gets back to,\nto Michael Pollan's mantra,\neat food, not too much, mostly plants.\nI think if you stick\nwith these simple rules,\nand don't overthink,\nlike, should I have this?\nCan I eat eggs? Can I eat...\nJust kind of stick to these simple rules,\nit makes it very approachable.\nBut I agree, so these\ngastroenterology fellows\nthat we've had in our lab say that they...\nIt's really hard.\nWe kind of say to them,\nwhy won't you give this dietary advice\nthat's really well-known.\nAnd they just said, well,\nit's, it's really hard\nto get people to change their diet,\nunless you're doing either\na go, no-go sort of thing,\nor eliminating something.\nSo if carrots are giving you\nproblems, don't eat carrots.\nAnd that's a very simple,\neasy instruction to follow,\nbut doesn't really deal\nwith the root problem\nof why can't you eat carrots,\nbecause you should be able to eat carrots.\nMost people can eat carrots.\nAnd so I think that we...\nYeah, when we're thinking\nabout things like fasting,\nand all these different dietary regimes\nand cleanses that people do,\nwe have to step back for\na moment and say, okay,\nwell, what are really the big,\nhigh level rules that we should take home?\nAnd then if you are experiencing problems,\nand you want to think about\nhow to deal with them,\nit's good to go to an\nevidence-based method\nwhere there's actually data to back it up.\nThe data in the field really\nshows that with like fasting,\nparticularly if you go to\nanimals that hibernate,\nor things like that, where\nthere's really extended fasts,\nyou actually have a microbiota come up\nthat blooms in the absence\nof food coming in through diet\nthat's really good at eating mucus.\nSo you have bacteria\nthat's that specialize\nin eating nutrients derived from the host,\nbecause there's no other\nnutrients to live on.\nNow, whether this is good\nor bad, we don't know.\nBut it seems like the\nconsumption of mucus in excess\nis a problem from the\nstandpoint of microbes\ngetting too close to host tissue\nand inciting inflammation,\nwhich is what we see in animal models\nwhen we deprive of dietary fiber.\nWe see these mucus\nutilizers become abundant,\nand inflammatory markers start to come on.\nSo fasting short term\nmight be fine, probably.\nThere's definitely benefits\nthat are seen metabolically.\nIn terms of what it means\nfor long term health\nfrom the standpoint of the gut microbiota,\nI would say we don't have\nthe answer to that yet.\nIn terms of the cleanses and\nthe flushes and all this,\npersonally, I think it's a terrible idea.\nI mean, we know that if...\nIn studies that are being\ndone now to reprogram\nthe gut microbiota to install\na completely new microbial community,\nthe first step is to wash away\nthe resident microbial\ncommunity that's there.\nSo if you're in the process of acquiring\na really good microbiota\nand you know how to do that,\nthen flushing everything out is great.\nOtherwise, what is happening\nis you're kind of leaving\nrebuilding of the community\nto chance, like what is it?\nAnd so what microbes\nare going to colonize?\nWho's going to take up space\nafter you do this flush or cleanse?\nAnd I think it's a little bit\nlike playing Russian Roulette.\nYou may end up with a\ngood microbial community\nin there afterwards, you may not.\nYou certainly want to pay close attention\nto what you're eating while you're doing\nthe reconstitution of the community\nafter you do something like that.\n- Yeah.\nThank you for that.\nI know a lot of people are interested\nin these kinds of elimination diets.\nAnd intermittent fasting/\ntime-restricted feeding\nseems to be getting\nsome traction, in part,\nbecause at some level we are\nall doing this when we sleep.\nMost of us aren't eating\nwhile we sleep anyway,\nand adjusting the numbers\nseems more accessible\nfor a lot of people.\nWe have a lot of colleagues at Stanford\nwho I know happen to of that regimen,\nor a time-restricted feeding regimen,\nbut also who follow the more\ntraditional meal spacing\nas well, of course.\nOne of the things that I wonder about\nas we talk about primarily\nplant-based with some,\nwhat did you say the Pollan thing was?\nIt was eat mostly plants\nand then maybe some meat,\nbut not too much, or not\ntoo much...\n- Yeah, eat food,\nmostly plants, not too much.\n- Got it.\n- Or sorry, eat food, not\ntoo much, mostly plants.\n- Got it.\nI hear this again and again.\nI know there are a number of\npeople who do seem to do well\non a lower carbohydrate, and\neven some people who report\nfeeling much better on a really strictly,\nalmost meat, organ-only diet.\nAnd the only reason I raise is not...\nI don't participate in...\nI'm one of those omnivores that out there,\nI do eat some meat and\nI do eat plants as well.\nBut the reason I raise\nthis is that earlier\nyou were talking about communities\nthat may have microbiota\nthat are healthier than ours,\nor at least different than ours.\nAnd there are communities in the world\nthat subsist largely on animal products,\nor for which unprocessed animal products\nare considered the richest-nutrient foods\nin those communities.\nProtein is very scarce in...\nAncestrally, protein was more scarce,\nso eggs and meat and things of that sort.\nSo could there be a genetic component?\nIn other words, if we\nfast forward 10 years\nand we actually can make sense\nof all this human genome stuff,\nare we going to find that someone\nwho has Scandinavian roots,\nor somebody who has South American roots,\nor somebody had descended\nfrom a different tribe,\nwill do better on one\nparticular diet versus another,\nand thereby, or I should say,\nand in parallel with that,\nthat their gut microbiome\nwill have different signatures that are...\nSo your microbiome might thrive on plants\nand mine might thrive on organ meats.\nAnd as I say this, I'm not a\nbig consumer of organ meats.\nI'm just laying this\nout for sake of example.\n- Yeah.\nYeah, great.\nSo,\na few notes, the first one\nhas to do with carbohydrates\nand restriction of carbohydrates,\nand some people feeling healthier\nwhen they cut carbohydrates out.\nMy guess is...\nThis is my theory to be tested,\nthat people feel better\ncutting carbohydrates out,\nbecause the diet that we\neat in the United States\nand in industrialized countries,\nthe carbohydrates are largely crap.\n- Processed.\n- They're processed.\n- Right.\n- It's like starch,\nsimple sugar.\nIt's things that contribute\nto glycemic index.\nIt's these sugars that we eat.\nThey make it to our small intestine,\nthey get chopped up into simple sugars,\nabsorbed into our bloodstream,\nand we have a ton of glucose then\ncoursing through our\nveins, which we know is bad\nand can lead to things like diabetes.\nIf the carbohydrates that were in our diet\nwere complex carbohydrates, dietary fiber,\nand we like to refer to\nthe subset of dietary fiber\nthat the microbiota can actually access\nas microbiota-accessible carbohydrates.\nAnd the reason that we like that term\nis it has the word carbohydrate in it.\nAnd it's to point out that\nnot all carbs are bad,\nit's just, there are bad carbs or carbs,\nor carbs that are bad if you consume them\nin too high quantity,\nthings like table sugar\nand simple starches,\nbut there are good carbs as well.\nAnd these microbiota-accessible\ncarbohydrates\nare the complex ones that we can't digest,\nand fuel our got microbiota,\nour gut microbiota can ferment them.\nI think we probably\nall would be better off\nwith less of the carbs that\nwe're typically served,\nbut most of us, and probably\nthe vast majority of us\nwould be better off by\nconsuming a lot more carbs\nthat were complex, that\nwe're microbiotic-accessible.\nAnd I'll come back to why that's important\nin terms of our biology.\nThere's some mechanisms\nthat are known as to why\nthose complex carbohydrates\nare so important\nfor our health, for most of us.\nI think this aspect of human\ngenetic adaptation to diet\nis super interesting.\nAnd then layer on top\nof that got microbiota\nadaptation to diet, which\nis another layer of this\nthat is also fascinating.\nIt's very clear that over\nvery short periods of time,\nhumans can adapt to\ndifferences in their diet,\nlactase persistence as kind of\nthe classic example of this.\nJust over the past 10,000 years,\ncertain groups of humans have adapted\nto being able to consume\ndairy by taking this enzyme,\nlactase, that normally is just expressed\nin most of the world's\npopulation early in life\nto be able to metabolize\nlactose in breast milk.\nBy extending the expression\nof that throughout life,\nnow you can consume milk\nfor your whole life.\nAnd so that is an example\nof specific populations\nof human genome,\ngenetically adapting to diet\nin a very short period of time.\nAnd there are other examples\nof this, and undoubtedly,\nthis has happened throughout the world\nto various aspects of diets.\nSo certainly it's important to remember\nthat there will be different diets\nthat are better for different groups,\nbased on what genes you harbor and have\nin your human genome.\nThe other aspect on top of that is that,\nthere are good examples\nof the gut microbiome\nadapting to cultural differences in diet.\nAnd the classic example of this\nis the degradation of seaweed.\nSo we know that most\nAmericans, if you eat sushi,\nand there's nori there and\nyou eat some of the seaweed,\nit has a dietary fiber\nin it known as porphyrin.\nThat porphyrin will shoot\nthrough most of us untransformed.\nInert substance.\nIt'll do other things like retain water,\nand serve as kind of\nsomething like cellulose,\nnot be fermented at a high level.\nIf somebody from Southeast Asia\nthat's always consumed seaweed,\nand is part of a culture\nthat consumes seaweed,\neats seaweed, they have a gut microbe\nthat can now metabolize porphyrin.\nAnd so there are these very\nspecific gene transfer events\nwhere the genes for\nbreaking down porphyrin\nhave been imported into the microbiome\nof many people in Southeast Asia to...\nWe can think of it as\nhelping digest porphyrin,\nbut it's really just a\nmicrobe that's found a niche,\nfound a way to make a living in the gut\nby consuming something that's\ncommon in the diet there.\nSo there are these different layers,\nthere are human genetic adaptations,\nand there are microbiome\nadaptations that are cultural,\nand based on people's geographic location.\nBut there's no escaping the fact\nthat for much of human evolution,\nthe vast majority of people\nthat are on this planet\nhad ancestors that were\nhunter-gatherers, foraging,\nconsuming huge quantities\nof plant material,\njust because that's what was there.\nAnd so one of the groups that we study,\nthe Hadza hunter-gatherers in Africa,\nand I should take a moment\njust to say that our research,\nand research of many people\nin our field and other fields\nrely on study of indigenous communities.\nAnd it's really important to\nthink of these communities,\nas our equals, they're\nmodern people on the planet.\nThey have interesting\nlifestyles that are informative\nwith regard to certain\naspects of human biology,\nbut in many cases, they also are\nleading a vulnerable existence.\nAnd so we really take great\ncare in our research program,\nand it's important for people to realize\nthat these populations\ntake part in our research,\nbecause they're wonderful\nresearch partners.\nAnd we need to be mindful\nof kind of thinking\nabout how, yeah, both we talk\nabout them and use our data\nthat has been gained through\ntheir generous contribution\nto our research program.\nThe Hadza hunter-gatherers,\nit's estimated,\nconsume on the order 100 to 150 grams\nof dietary fiber per day,\nand that's in stark contrast\nto the typical American\nthat consumes about 15 grams.\nSo somewhere, a seven to tenfold decrease\nin the main nutrient that\nfeeds are got microbiome\nin the American diet.\nThe Hadza are one example.\nThere are many different\nforaging populations,\nbut the vast majority of these populations\nconsume huge amounts of dietary fiber,\nbecause plants are the\nreliable, consistent source.\nIf you, as a hunter-gatherer go on a hunt,\nusually that hunt is unsuccessful.\nI think the data that one out\nof 20 hunts are successful\nin landing actually\nbig game for the Hadza.\nThey have birds that they\nshoot and small animals,\nbut quite often, day after day,\nthey're relying upon berries,\ntubers, baobab fruit.\nThey're relying on the\nplants in their environment.\nAnd actually if you go\nto the data and look\nat what their fruit food preferences are,\ntheir food preferences are\nactually meat and honey.\nSo they don't eat a high fiber\ndiet because they love fiber.\nThey eat a high fiber diet,\nbecause that's what's\navailable and consistent\nfor them to survive.\nBut our brains are wired\nfor caloric density.\nAnd so if you took a Hadza\nand put them in a restaurant\nin the United States,\nthey would make the same\ncrappy decisions that we make,\nbecause we all want sugar\nand fat and calories.\nIt's how our brain is wired.\n- And protein and fat\nfor brain development,\nas far as we know, right?\nSo it sounds like the Hadza,\nI hope I'm pronouncing that correctly,\nyou said would prefer\nto eat meat and honey,\nbut they happen to consume\na lot of plant fiber\nas a consequence of what's available.\nOne of the questions I have\nas it relates to all of this,\nis it sounds to me like\nthere is no question\nfrom the pure vegan all the\nway to the extreme opposite,\nwhich would be pure meat diet,\nthat avoiding processed\nfoods is a good idea.\n- Yeah.\n- Or heavily processed foods,\nin general and I mean, not\nthat the occasional consumption\nis necessarily bad.\nBut whether or not one is thinking\nabout one macronutrient\nprofile or another,\nit sounds like consuming processed foods\nis just bad for the microbiome.\nCan we say that categorically?\nFor sure, yeah, yeah.\n- Okay.\n- Absolutely.\n- So you're a low carb person,\nyou're a zero carb person,\nyou're extreme vegan, no meat.\nWhether or not you're\nall meat, organ meat.\nSounds to me as if the number one thing,\nmaybe even, dare I say above\nChris's point about plants,\nalthough I'm not going to challenge\nChris Gardner on nutrition,\nI would be way outside\nthe lane lines to do that.\nBut is it to avoiding processed foods?\n- Yeah.\n- Is paramount.\n- Yeah, and I think that's\ncompletely compatible\nwith what Christopher was saying.\nHe was saying, if you\nprioritize getting a huge amount\nof whole, plant-based food\nwith a lot of fiber first,\nyou're not going to have room\nfor eating a lot of processed food.\n- [Andrew Huberman] Yeah, yeah.\n- So it's kind of the same\nas avoiding processed food.\nSo I think that those are\nexactly the same rule,\nand I think that you're exactly right.\nAnd we can break down...\nThere's a lot of data of\nwhy different components\nof processed food are so bad for us,\nand so bad for our microbiome.\nAnd I can talk about a\nfew examples of that.\nBut the flip side of this\nis this mechanism of...\nAnd again, thinking about the\nspectrum of a plant-based diet\nversus a meat-based diet.\nThere's a lot of data to tell us\nthat a meat or ketogenic, or high fat diet\nmay have big benefits in terms\nof short term metabolic health.\nThat's typically how people\nthink about that diet.\nThere's also a lot of heart disease\nthat's linked with that as well.\nThere's good literature for that,\nwhich is something for people\nto look at and be aware of.\nThe plant-based diet, if you're\neating a bunch of complex\nfibers that feed your gut microbiota,\nyour gut microbiota\nproduces these substances\ncalled short-chain fatty\nacids, things like butyrate.\nAnd it's known that these\nshort-chain fatty acids\nplay really essential components,\nboth in terms of fueling\ncolonocytes, enforcing the barrier,\nkeeping inflammation low,\nregulating the immune system,\nregulating metabolism.\nAnd so a lot of people\nthink of dietary fiber\nas this inert substance\nthat passes through,\nmakes this feel full\nmaybe for a little bit,\nbut we get hungry afterwards right away.\nIf you're eating a lot of fiber\nthat's feeding your gut microbiota,\nyour gut microbiota is just\nproducing this vast array\nof fermentation end products\nthat then get absorbed\ninto our bloodstream,\nand have all of these\ntremendous, cascading effects\nthat appear to be largely\nbeneficial on our biology.\nAnd so to think about that\nparadigm of simple carbs,\nversus complex carbs, in\nthe case of simple carbs,\nyou end up with high blood sugar,\nsomething that will spike your insulin,\nand have all kinds of\nweird, metabolic effects.\nIn the case of complex carbohydrates,\nyou'll end up with very low blood sugar,\nbecause most of those\nhave low glycemic index\nand a bunch of short-chain fatty acids\nthat are having regulatory roles.\nSo just to round out that topic,\nI think there is a reason to think that,\nmaybe not appropriate for\nabsolutely everyone out there,\nbut I think the vast majority of people,\nparticularly given the statistics\nof what we know people eat\nin the United States and in\nindustrialized countries,\nmost people would reap\ntremendous health benefits\nfrom eating more whole,\nplant-based dietary fiber.\nNow, processed foods, I\nthink, is this other dimension\nwhere you have all of\nthese weird chemicals,\nartificial sweeteners, weird fats,\na lot of refined, simple nutrients.\nThe simple nutrients we've talked about,\nbut we know that for instance,\nartificial sweeteners\ncan have a massive negative\nimpact on the gut microbiome\nand can lead us towards\nmetabolic syndrome, actually.\nThere's been beautiful work\nout of the Weizmann Institute on this.\nAnd then emulsifiers,\nthese compounds that are\nput in processed foods\nto help them maintain shelf stability\nso things don't separate.\nAnd so all the the moisture content\nis retained appropriately.\nMany of these are known to\ndisrupt the mucus layer,\nand as soon as you start\ndisrupting that barrier,\nthat can lead you in the\ndirection of inflammation\nand in animal models,\nwe know that can lead towards\nmetabolic syndrome as well.\nSo there's components of\nprocessed food, that are,\nwhen studied in isolation known to have\na direct negative impact on\ngut biology in the microbiota.\n- Yeah, the mention of artificial\nsweeteners interesting.\nI confess it's a third rail on...\nTalking about artificial sweeteners,\nthere are two camps it\nseems, or at least two camps.\nOne that say artificial sweeteners\nare not detrimental at all.\nAnother that says\nthey're very detrimental,\nmainly based on the mouse studies.\nAnd then there are people\nin the middle that are...\nI put myself in that category.\nI drink the occasional diet soda,\nI don't consume them in large volume,\nbut I'm sort of in the middle there.\nAnd so I just throw that out there,\nbecause I know immediately\npeople are jumping on that,\nbut I will just mention\nthere's some recent data\nout of Diego Bohorquez's\nlab at Duke University\nthat the neurons that\nlive in the gut mucose\nof these neuro pod cells\ncan actually distinguish\nbetween artificial and true sweet...\nSugar versus artificial sweeteners.\nThey send different\npatterns of neural signals\nup to the brain, and the brain circuitry\nseems strongly impacted.\nSo I think that as the data emerge,\nwe're hearing more and more of\nthese artificial sweeteners.\nEither are problematic\nor at least are signaling\ndifferent events in the gut.\nI do want to make sure that we distinguish\nartificial sweeteners\nfrom non-caloric plant-based sweeteners.\n- Yeah.\n- And this is based\non a mistake that I've\nmade over and over again\non the podcast where\nI'll just kind of lump\nartificial sweeten into one big category,\nand then I'll mention stevia.\nSo what about plant-based sweeteners\nthat are not artificial,\nthey weren't manufactured in a laboratory,\nlike saccharin or sucralose, or aspartame?\nDo we know anything about plant-based,\nnon caloric sweeteners or\nlow caloric sweeteners?\n- Very little.\nA lot of those have a lot\nmore bang for the buck.\nThey're incredibly sweet,\nso it takes a really small amount for them\nto trigger a huge amount of sweetness.\nAnd so it's, depending upon\nthe mechanism of action\nby which these sweeteners\nthat are not sugar\nare impacting our biology.\nIt may be that those are\nactually less negative\nor more healthy than the\nones that are artificial,\njust because it requires\nless of them in the food\nfor us to perceive that sweet taste.\nIt may also be that because they're...\nI don't think that everything\nis that's natural is better,\nnecessarily than things\nthat are artificial,\nbut it may be that because of\nkind of evolutionary exposure\nto these compounds in our diet,\nhistorically there are, I think,\ntraditional populations that\nuse these, for instance,\nto sweeten different foods,\nthat our bodies just know\nhow to deal with those compounds better\nthan the ones that are synthetic.\nBut I think the studies\nstill need to be done.\n- Do you actively avoid\nartificial sweeteners?\nSucralose, aspartame, saccharin?\nYou personally.\n- Yeah.\nSo I do, I avoid them, but I'm not...\nSo I work closely with my\nwife, Erica, as you know.\nWe were in the lab together\nand we wrote this book,\n\"The Good Gut,\" where we\nkind of document our journey\nin changing our lifestyle,\ndietary habits, choices we make\nbased on the research as\nwe've gotten to know it\nin the gut microbiota\nover the past 15 years.\nAnd I think that one of the\nlessons that we've learned\nis that just doing things in moderation\nmakes it a lot easier,\nand doing things slowly\nmakes it a lot easier.\nSo there are very few rules that I have\nthat are hard and fast.\nI'm a pretty flexible eater.\nI don't believe that having a diet Coke\nwill somehow cascade into\nsome terrible disease\nor something like that.\nI try to avoid them, I don't\nreally like the flavor of them.\nI'm super sensitive to\nthe nuances of the flavor,\neven with the stevia and mogrosides\nfrom monk fruit and stuff like that.\nThe off flavors are really\nhard for me to deal with.\nBut also in this journey\nof changing our diet...\nLike when we started off\nin microbiome research,\nI was in the habit of in the\nafternoons having a sweet,\na muffin or a cookie,\nor something like that.\nAnd when we started to realize\nthat we should be eating\nless sweets and eating more dietary fiber,\nthis was an incredibly\ndifficult change for me to make.\nI was just wired to kind of crave this-\n- Classic scientist.\nScientists love the pastry in\nthe afternoon and the coffee.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- And in the old days\nit used to be a cigarette too.\n- Right, exactly.\n- When I started my training,\na lot of people still smoked\n- Yeah, right.\n- And it was only during\nmy post-doctoral training\nthat they eliminate smoking on campuses,\nand productivity took\na trough for a while,\nuntil these people developed other tools\nto focus their attention.\n- Exactly, exactly.\nSo there is this kind of need,\nand then once you have\nan ingrained behavior,\nand maybe things that are addictive,\nit becomes incredibly\ndifficult to break that habit.\nAnd so I would say, gradually\nover the course of like,\nfive or more years, we\nhave migrated our diet\naway from sweet foods to\nthings that are less sweet.\nAnd it's been a journey,\nit's been a slow process,\nbut we've gotten to the point now\nwhere we've just retrained our pallets.\nAnd it's amazing how this happens now,\nwhere I'll have something\nthat is something\nthat I would've used to have like daily.\nAnd it's unpalatable.\nI just can't deal with\nthe sweetness of it.\nAnd I certainly avoid\nartificial sweeteners,\nbut I also avoid just\nsweet things in general\nthat have sugar in them,\njust because they now,\nwas originally, I was\ntrying to be disciplined\nand trying to change my diet,\nbut now they just don't taste good to me.\n- Yeah, likewise,\nI completely lost my appetite for sugar\nat the turn of the last year,\nand I don't know how to\nexplain it, but the way I...\nEven though I don't have\na mechanistic explanation,\nI say I like sweet people, I\ndon't like sweet food anymore.\nI just don't.\nI have not lost my\nappetite for fatty foods.\nI love cheese and certain meats for me,\nI blame my Argentine lineage is,\nis I gravitate towards them.\nBut in any case, avoiding processed foods,\nprobably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers,\nthese kinds of things.\nAnd for people listening or watching,\nwe're not setting up strict guidelines.\nWe're just bouncing around the carnival\nthat is the microbiome and nutrition,\nbecause I think that we\nhear this everywhere,\neat this, don't eat that, or\nthis is best for microbiome,\nor worse for microbiome.\nBut I'm hearing fiber again and again,\nso we're going to come back to fiber,\nbut I want to make sure\nthat we close the hatch\non this issue of fasting and cleansing.\nBased on your answer\nearlier, it sounds to me like\nit is not necessary to\ndo a cleanse or fast\nprior to an attempt to\nrepopulate the microbiome.\nIn other words, if I want to\nmake my microbiome healthier,\nit sounds like I don't\nhave to try and flush\nall the current microbiota\nout of there first,\nis that correct?\n- Yeah, it's a very good question,\nand I don't mean to\nsuggest that those things\nare known to be terrible.\nOr I would just say, the\nstudies haven't been done.\nAnd to me, wiping out\nthis microbial community,\nunless it's done with some sort of...\nUnless it's done in an informed way,\nand we don't really have the information\nfor how that would be done.\nIt just seems like playing\nthe lottery a little bit.\n- Okay.\n- And so I think...\nI don't want to say that those are...\nIt may be that when the study is done,\nthose are shown to be amazing,\nbut I just don't think we have\nthe data to know that yet.\nSo it's somewhat of an arbitrary thing.\nIf somebody out there feels\nway better when they do this,\nand are not experiencing problems with it,\nthen maybe it's the right thing for them.\nBut I certainly can't say that\nit's something great to do.\nI can't imagine a future\nwhere as the microbiome\ngets incorporated into\nthis emerging paradigm\nof precision health, you go into a clinic,\nsomebody types your microbiome and says,\noh, there's this huge,\nmassive misconfiguration.\nYou have all these engrafted bacteria\nthat are residents in your gut microbiome\nthat are sending out molecules\nthat are not good for your health.\nIt would be good if we do\na mass-reprogramming of it.\nThe way that we do that\nis we flush your gut,\nand we actually give a\nlight antibiotic treatment\nto try to kill everything that's there.\nAnd then we repopulate\nwith this other consortium\nof microbes that we've\nstudied and know are healthy,\nknow are compatible\nwith your human genome,\nand can be reinforced with a diet\nthat we know is good for you.\nWe'll install those microbes,\nwe'll help you along\nin the diet so you know\nhow to nourish those microbes,\nand that will be the way\nthat will reconfigure\nyour gut microbiome.\nSo I can't imagine a future\nwhere that sort of flushing,\nor cleansing is part of something\nfor repopulating the gut.\nBut right now it seems a\nlittle half-baked to me.\nYeah.\n- Great.\nI'd love to talk about\nfiber and fermented foods,\nbecause you and Chris had a really,\nwhat I think is a really\ninteresting and exciting paper\nat the end of last year about\ncomparing the inflammatome,\nso inflammatory markers of people who ate\na certain amount of fiber,\nor a certain amount of\nthese fermented foods.\nThis study is amazing for several reasons,\nbut almost as amazing as how diverse\nthe interpretation of this\nstudy was in the media.\nIf ever there was a study\nthat was kind of hijacked\nby different priority schemes out there-\n- Yeah.\n- It's this study.\nSo you performed the study with Chris,\nand your postdocs, and\ngraduate students and staff.\nWhat are the major conclusions\nand what sorts of directives,\nif any, emerged from this study?\nAnd I'll just preface\nthis again by saying,\nif I wasn't clear, some news report said,\n\"Ah, this means fiber is not important.\"\n- Yeah.\n- And then others said,\nthis means fermented foods\nand fiber are important.\nAnd others said, fermented\nfoods are the thing,\nand the only thing.\nIt was all over the place.\n- Yep.\n- And one of the reasons for\ndoing this podcast at all\nis so that we can go straight\nto the people who perform the work.\n- Fantastic.\n- And even though\nI'm certainly not an expert in microbiome,\nto give you the opportunity\nto share with me,\nand me to ask the kinds\nof questions that have...\nI have zero agenda.\nI do like sauerkraut, I do\ndrink the occasional kombucha.\nI do like low sugar, not so\nsweet forms of fermented foods.\nSo I would be delighted if\nfermented foods are good for me,\nbut I have no stake in the\nfermented and food industry.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah. Great.\nYeah, wonderful, and\nan important note there\nis the one you pointed out,\nthat this is an incredible collaboration\nwith Christopher Gardner's lab,\nand a bunch of people.\nErica Sonnenburg helped lead\nthis study, and then tons of,\nlike you were saying, postdoc staff\nand other people at Stanford,\nand then wonderful participants\nthat were part of this study.\nSo a huge team effort.\nLet me tell you, before\nI dive into that study,\nlet me take a step back,\nbecause I think the reason\nthat we did this study, and\nkind of Christopher's group,\nand our group has started\nto pursue this line\nof looking at dietary interventions\nand how they impact our microbiome,\nhow they impact human biology,\ngoes back to this kind of\nepiphany that we we had\nwhile studying the gut microbiome.\nBecause I think when we started\nstudying it at Stanford,\nwe were thinking about it as this\nkind of newly appreciated\naspect of our biology,\nalmost like finding an organ\nthat we didn't know was there,\nand starting to think about\nlike all the drug targets\nthat were there.\nCan we go in with small molecule drugs,\nand think of ways to\nmanipulate this community\nto ameliorate disease?\nAnd this is largely the\nmindset of Western medicine,\nand largely born out of the\nera of infectious disease.\nYou wait for an infection to\nstart a bacterial infection,\nyou treat with antibiotics,\nand that's the way medicine is practiced,\nand that's become less\nsuccessful over time,\nas we've moved into this\nera of inflammatory,\nWestern diseases, and with the exception\nof the current pandemic\nthat's sweeping the world,\nlargely moved out of the\nera of infectious diseases,\nat least infectious bacterial diseases,\nthat this paradigm of waiting\nfor diseases to appear,\nand come into the clinic is\nnot really very effective\nin the context of\ninflammatory, Western diseases,\nautoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome,\nheart diseases, and inflammatory disease.\nThe list goes on and on.\nAnd so we started to\nthink a lot about like,\nhow can we get out in front of this?\nHow can we think about preventative ways\nof dealing with this crisis of metabolic\nand inflammatory diseases?\nAnd this tremendous,\nbeautiful body of literature\nstarted to come forward in\nthe field about 10 years ago\nthat showed that the gut\nmicrobiome is absolutely critical\nto modulating our immune status.\nSo if you change the microbiome,\nyou can fundamentally change\nhow the immune system operates.\nAnd we know that the immune system\nis at the basis of a lot of these disease,\ninflammatory, chronic diseases.\nAnd so it brought up this\npossibility that maybe the fact\nthat we're not nourishing\nthis community well enough,\nmaybe the fact that it's\ndeteriorated over time\ndue to all of the things that go along\nwith an industrialized lifestyle,\nantibiotics and so forth.\nMaybe we have a microbiome right now\nin the industrialized\nworld that is setting\nour immune system at a set\npoint, simmering inflammation\nthat's driving us towards\nthese inflammatory diseases.\nAnd wouldn't it be wonderful\nif we could figure out how to\nuse diet specifically, but\njust kind of learn the rules\nof how to reconfigure both the composition\nand function of our gut microbiome,\nso that inflammation was\ndifferent in our bodies,\nso that each one of us was less likely\nto go on and to develop\nan inflammatory disease,\nleading to better longevity and health\nover the course of our life.\nAnd so we were studying this\nin actually in mouse models,\nand realizing that we really needed\nto start doing human studies.\nWe needed to start studying\nmicrobiome in humans,\nand because we were studying diet,\nwe knew that this was\nsomething we could go in\nand do right away.\nWe didn't have to apply\nfor FDA approval for a drug\nbefore we could do a human study,\nwe could just start doing\nhuman dietary interventions,\nlongitudinally monitoring\nthe immune system,\nand the microbiome, and starting\nto put the pieces together\nof what is it in diet that can change\nour microbiome in a healthy way,\nhelp us define what a\nhealthy microbiome is,\nand monitor the immune\nsystem in great detail.\nAnd so there were really two\ncritical components of this,\nin addition to our microbiome expertise.\nOne was Christopher Gardner's group.\nWe wanted to do these human studies,\nbut we're absolutely terrified of humans.\nWe work with mice. Humans\nare terrifying in many ways.\n- But they house themselves,\nyou don't have to pay-\n- That's true.\n- You don't have to pay\nfor their housing.\n- That's true.\n- For those that can afford\nhousing, of course, yeah.\n- Yeah, sadly, just for that\nportion of the population.\nSo Christopher's group were,\nthey were our masters at\nworking with human populations.\nAnd then the other wonderful\nthing that we have at Stanford\nis this Human Immune Monitoring Center\nrun by Mark Davis and Holden Maecker.\nThey started this beautiful\ncenter for allowing people\nto do immunology in humans.\nCritical element, because\na lot of the mouse studies\ndon't translate well to humans.\nSo if you can do the studies in humans,\nsimilar to how we were\nthinking about the microbiome,\nyou learn something that you\nknow is relevant to humans.\nAnd so having that immune\nprofiling capability\nwhere we can monitor hundreds to thousands\nof different parameters\nin the immune system,\nlongitudinally in people,\nfrom a blood draw,\nand not just know if CRP\ngoes up or if interleukin-6\ngoes up or down, but to be\nable to see all these facets\nof the immune system change in concert,\nas we're changing the microbiome with diet\nwas really a key component of this.\nAnd so our flagship study,\nsupported by wonderful donors.\nSo this actually isn't\nfunded by typical foundations\nand national institutes of health,\nit was funded by philanthropy.\nWe wanted to understand if we put people\non a high fiber diet,\nhow would that affect their\nmicrobiome immune system?\nAnd if we put them on a high food diet,\na diet rich in live microbes\nand all the metabolites\nthat are present from\nfermentation and foods,\nhow would that change\nmicrobiome in immune system?\n- Could you give us some examples\nof what those diets look like?\nAnd were you changing their basal diet,\nor were you just adding things on top\nof what they were already eating?\n'Cause it's hard to change people's diets.\n- It's very hard.\n- And then you have to trust\nthat they actually do it and\nthey're not sneaking, and-\n- Totally, yeah.\nWe started this center for\nhuman microbiome studies\nat Stanford for doing\na lot of these studies,\nand a portion of the studies,\nwe do focus on supplements,\nprobiotics, microbes\ndelivered in pill form.\nPrebiotics, which are\npurified forms of fiber.\nAnd in those cases, we actually\ncan have placebo groups,\nbecause it's more like a drug study,\nand we don't change people's diets.\nSo we can just administer this\non top of what they're doing.\nSo in a way, they're\na lot more controlled,\nbut it's not food.\nWhen you start doing food studies,\nyou can't do a placebo group,\n'cause people know what they're eating.\nAnd the other problem is that\nit's really hard to just change one thing,\nbecause as soon as you\nstart adding something,\npeople usually eliminate something else.\nSo the idea was to\nbasically give these people\nsimple instructions for in the\ncase of the high fiber diet,\njust increasing plant-based fiber.\nSo can you eat more whole\ngrains, more legumes,\nmore vegetables, nuts, get\nthe fiber up in the range of,\nfrom 15 to 20 grams per day,\nup to over 40 grams per day.\nSo can you double or more the amount\nof fiber that you eat per day,\nknowing that that would\nhave a tremendous impact\non a lot of other facets of their diet.\nThey eat less meat, animal-based protein,\nless animal-based fats\nas a product of this.\nI will say that getting\nback to Christopher's rule\nfor a healthy diet, a lot of\nthe macro nutrient changes\nthat we saw in their diet were consistent\nwith healthy changes in diet.\nLess saturated fat, less\nanimal-based protein,\nmore plant-based protein.\nSo a lot of changes that are known\nto be beneficial came in concert\nwith just telling people,\neat a high fiber diet, high\nplant-based fiber diet.\nThe people that were eating\nthe high fermented food diet,\nthey were instructed to basically eat\nfoods that you could\nbuy at a grocery store\nthat were naturally fermented\nand contain live microbes.\nAnd so this largely\nconsisted of yogurt, kefir,\nsauerkraut, kimchi, some\nfermented vegetables,\nbrined, fermented vegetables.\n- Pickles.\n- Pickles, things like that.\nOne of the things that\nI think is a pitfall\nin choosing fermented foods is,\nyou can go down the canned food aisle\nand there's this huge section of pickles,\nand jars that are canned.\nThose are not fermented foods.\nThose are are cucumbers that\nthey've put in a acidic acid\nand vinegar to reconstitute\nthat fermented flavor,\nbut there's no live\nmicrobes involved in that.\nAnd even sauerkrauts in\nthe canned food aisle,\neven if they were naturally fermented,\nquite often they're not.\nQuite often they're\njust brined in vinegar.\nBut even if they are naturally fermented,\nall the microbes are\nkilled prior to canning\nor during the process of canning.\nSo what we use for this study\nand if you want to have\nlive fermented foods\nthat contain live microbes,\nyou need to buy those\nout of the refrigerated\nsection, essentially.\n- And I'm really glad\nyou pointed this out,\nbecause you can find sauerkraut\non the non-refrigerated shelf,\nthat is indeed non fermented.\nA lot of fermented that\nare available in the US\ncan be high in sugar.\nSo was there any instruction\nas to getting people\nto make sure that they\nwere consuming yogurts\nthat weren't loaded with sugar?\n- Yep.\n- Or did you let them just\nselect for the stuff in the\ncold section that is fermented?\n- No, super important point.\nWe instructed people to\neat non-sweetened yogurts.\nI think a huge pitfall in this\narea is you can have a yogurt\nloaded with bacteria, kind of\nthe base of what's healthy,\nand then a ton of like\nartificial flavoring\nand sugar loaded on top of that.\nManufacturers put a ton\nof sugar in after the fact\nto kind of mask the sour\ntaste fermented foods,\nwhich is hard for some people\nto become accustomed to.\nWhen we were switching\nto more fermented foods,\nour daughters were young at that point,\nwe would take plain yogurt,\nwhich they didn't like just neat,\nwe would mix in a little\nmaple syrup or honey,\njust a little bit, and\ngradually we would reduced that\nover time to the point where\nthey're pallet adjusted,\nand now they just really\nlike plain yogurt.\nBut it is, I think, getting\nused to that sour flavor\nis difficult, but people\nreally should try to stay away\nfrom those fermented foods\nthat are loaded with sugar.\nAnd that's what we instructed\npeople in this study.\n- And beer was not included.\n- Right.\n- The number of people\nthat asked, when I did a\nbrief thing on social media\nabout this study, and\nhopefully I got it right.\nI think I did.\nBut people just ask about beer.\nI'm not a drinker, so for me,\nbeer has no appeal anyway.\nBut beer is fermented, correct?\nBut were they instructed to\navoid beer or to drink beer?\n- Just to go with their\nnormal dietary habits,\nbut that did not count\nas a fermented food.\n- And kombucha was, as I recall-\n- Kombucha was, and kombucha can have\nsmall amounts of alcohol in it.\nYeah, kombucha actually\nwas one of the major things\nthat people drank during,\nor consumed during the\nfermented food phase.\nAnd the deal with beer\nis that there may be beneficial properties\nof the microbial communities\nin naturally fermented beer,\nbut most of the beer that we buy, again,\nis canned and filtered, and\nthere's no live microbes there.\nSo very different than\nif you siphon it off\nof your home brew and drink it, probably,\nthan if you buy it in a store.\n- I will get to the results of\nthe study in just one moment.\nBut I want to say, a\nlot of people shy away\nfrom the high quality fermented foods,\nbecause they can be quite costly.\nAnd I'll just refer people to a resource\nin Tim Ferriss's book, \"The 4-Hour Chef,\"\nhe actually gives an excellent recipe\nfor making your own sauerkraut,\nwhich basically involves\ncabbage and water and salt,\nbut you have to do it properly,\nbecause you can grow some,\nnot necessarily lethal,\nbut some somewhat dangerous bacteria\nif you don't scrape off\nthe top layer properly,\nbut he gives beautiful instructions\nfor how to do this in vats.\nWe've started doing this\nat home now, actually,\nis we got a, just ceramic vat.\nAnd you can make large amounts\nof truly fermented sauerkraut\njust from cabbage water and salt,\nif you're willing to follow the protocol.\nAnd if you're interested in science,\nthat protocol looks a\nlot like what you'll do\nfor most of your graduate career,\nexcept maybe some sequencing too.\nSo anyway, just to\nrefer people to a source\nthat's very low cost.\n- Yeah.\n- Compared to buying\nthe high quality, fermented foods.\nEven kombuchas, for some\npeople, it's like $5 a bottle-\n- Totally.\n- Only this much.\nAnd if you consume liquids\nthe way I consume them,\nthat's just the the start, so-\n- Yeah.\nBut if you can get your hands on a SCOBY,\nkombucha is another one\nthat's super simple.\n- You can grow your own.\n- You can just make your own,\nand it's super easy to do.\nI make it, I constantly have a batch\nof kombucha going at home.\nIt's a SCOBY, a symbiotic\ncommunity of bacteria and yeast.\nYou brew tea, you add sugar to\nit, and you put the SCOBY in,\nand you wait a week or two,\ndepending upon the temperature,\nand then you just move the\nSCOBY or over to a new batch,\nand you your old, what the\nSCOBY was in is kombucha,\nand it's wonderful.\n- I love it, I would love it\nif members of this audience\nwould start to make their\nown kombucha and sauerkraut.\nI've been having so much fun.\nI don't do it, but it's done in our home.\nI don't go anywhere near\nthe food production,\nand it's for everyone's benefit.\nSo how much fermented\nfood were they consuming?\n'Cause you mentioned the number\nof grams approximately of fiber,\nbut was it in servings, ounces?\nHow many times a day? Early day, late day?\n- Right, yeah.\nSo we had a wonderful dietician\ninstructing people for this,\nand her name's Dalia Perelman,\nand she really was the key and is the key\nfor many of our studies\nfor getting people to eat differently.\nAnd the general instructions\nwere for people to eat\nas much fermented foods as\npossible, more is better.\nAnd the reason is that\nwith this initial study,\nwe really wanted to maximize our chance\nof seeing a signal if there was\nsomething biological going on,\nwith the idea that if\nthe dose was excessive\nand not easily achievable by\na lot of people in the end,\nwe can go back and and say, okay,\nthis is the point at which we\nlose the biological signal.\nBut people during the height\nof the intervention phase,\nthe intervention phase was six weeks,\nduring the height of that,\nwere up over six servings, on average,\nper day of fermented foods.\nSo kind of two servings at each meal.\nAnd the ounces or weight or size,\nit really depended on what\nthe fermented food was.\nAnd we just told them to stick\nto what was a recommended\ndose on the package\nthat they were buying,\nFor kombucha, it'd be like\na six to eight ounce glass.\nSauerkraut like a half cup,\nor something like that,\nand same with yogurt.\n- Great. So what were the results?\n- Yeah, so the results\nastounded us in a way,\nbut then thinking more deeply,\nand it'll be evident\neven after I explain it\nin the context of this conversation,\nlikely why we saw the results we saw.\nThe results were astounding\nbecause our hypothesis\ngoing into this was\nthat the high fiber diet\nwas going to give the massive signal.\nWe know that this is the big\ndeficiency in the Western diet.\nAll the mouse studies have\ntold us that high fiber\nreally leads to a much\nhealthier microbiota,\nit can lead to positive\nchanges in the immune system.\nAnd in fact, even when we had a limited...\nWe had wonderful donor support,\nbut still a limited amount of money\nwhen we started this study.\nMy lab was really very\neager to do the high fiber\npart of this really well,\nand Christopher kind of\nhad to twist our arms\nto do the fermented food side of it.\nAnd we thought it was\nkind of quirky and neat,\nlive microbes should be\nexciting, let's try it.\nSo we put that in and it turns out\nthat we were very thankful\nthat he twisted our arms,\nbecause it was that\nhigh fermented food arm\nthat really gave us the big signal.\nEven though our hypothesis\nwas that the high fiber\nwas going to lead to more short-chain\nfatty acids produced in the\ngut, more diverse microbiota,\nless inflammation in the immune system,\nwe didn't see that across the cohort.\nWe actually saw very\nindividualized responses\nto the dietary fiber,\nand I'll come back to\nwhat those responses were.\nThe big signal really was\nin the fermented food group.\nWe saw all the things\nthat you would hope to see\nin a Western microbiota in western human.\nWe saw this increase\nin microbiota diversity\nover the course of the six weeks\nwhile they were consuming\nthe fermented foods.\nAnd we can't always say that\nhigher diversity is better\nwhen it comes to our\nmicrobial communities.\nWe know there are cases for\ninstance, bacterial vaginosis,\nwhere higher diversity is actually\nindicative of a disease state,\nbut we know in the context of the gut,\nand for people living in\nthe industrialized world,\nhigher diversity is generally better.\nWe know that there's a\nspectrum of diversity.\nPeople with higher diversity\ngenerally are healthier.\nIf you can push your diversity higher,\nyou're in better shape.\nAnd so we saw that increase in diversity.\nAnd then the major question is,\nwhat happened to the immune system\nas these people were increasing\ntheir gut microbiota diversity\nthrough the fermented foods?\nSo we did this massive immune profiling,\nand we see a couple dozen immune markers,\ninflammatory markers decrease\nover the course of the study.\nSo we measured these\nat multiple time points\nthroughout the course of the study,\nand there's kind of this\nset stepwise reduction\nin things like interleukin-6,\nand interleukin-12,\na variety of famous\ninflammatory mediators.\nAnd then even if you go\ninto the immune cells\nand you start looking at\ntheir signaling cascades,\nwe see that those signaling\ncascades are less activated\nat the end of the study compared\nto the beginning of the study,\nindicating in attenuation of inflammation.\nSo kind of exactly what\nwe would hypothesize\nwould lead to less propensity\nfor inflammatory disease over time.\nThat's a huge extension\nof a very short study and-\n- How long was this study again?\n- So the complete protocol\nI think was 14 to 17 weeks,\nor something like that.\nThe actual intervention phase\nconsisted of a four week ramp\nand then a six week maintenance period.\nSo the intervention itself was 10 weeks,\nbut there were six weeks\nof really kind of hardcore,\nhigh levels of fiber or fermented foods.\n- Yeah, and I'm glad\nyou mentioned the ramp,\n'cause my experience with\nfermented foods is that you,\nit can be beneficial to give the system\nan opportunity to act acclimate.\nI mean, if you consume a\ngiant bowl of sauerkraut,\nit's not going to be the worst\nday and night of your life,\nbut you'll know you did.\n- Totally.\n- We'll just leave it at that.\nAnd so you want to kind\nof acclimate to it.\n- Absolutely.\n- I'm at the point now where,\nsome people might think this is gross,\nbut after I exercise,\nI've been sweating a lot,\nI like the saltiness of the...\nI actually drink the\nliquid that the sauerkraut\nhas been stewing in, and I get,\nI like to think that I consume\nsome fermentation that way,\nit's salty, it as kind of a\npost-training replenishment.\nBut if I had done that six\nmonths ago, straight off,\nI think it would've been\npretty rough on my system.\nI started taking little bits of it\nand then adding it each day.\n- Totally, and so both\nwith the fermented foods\nand the fiber, it's well known\nthat this kind of gradual ramping\nis a really important way\nof mitigating bloating,\nand other digestive\ndiscomfort that can happen\nwhen your microbiome reconfigures\nand starts fermenting more,\nand changing community members.\nSo you should take that\nramp at your own pace.\nIf something seems to be going wrong,\njust kind of level off, stay there.\nWe did this in a very delicate way\nto get people up to the high dose.\nThe brine, just a tangent\nhere for a second,\nthat was actually one of the products\nthat we had people use in\nthe fermented food phase.\nThere's actually a\nproduct called Gut Shots,\nwhich is just bring that they've marketed.\nWe actually are now\nstudying it in the lab.\nI just actually, before\nthis came from a lab meeting\nwhere a GI fellow in my lab\nis actually putting Gut Shots,\nsterilized gut microbe, or the\nfermentation microbes removed\nor present into mice\nand looking at changes\nin their mucosal immune system.\nSo we're studying this in detail now,\nbecause it's a rich source of lactate\nand a bunch of other\ninteresting metabolites.\n- I love that my weird behavior\nis inadvertently being\nstudied at Stanford Medicine.\nI want to just mention\nsomething about the Gut Shots.\nThose are sold as a drink.\nThose also, just for certain\nlisteners in different budgets,\nthey can be very expensive\nif you really think about...\nSome of them are exceedingly expensive.\nBut what I described before\nwith making your own kombuchas,\nit's not quite brining, but\nthe homemade sour sauerkraut,\nthat protocol is out there, as I mentioned\nin Tim's book, \"The 4-Hour Chef.\"\nAnd you get a lot of\nthe brining from that,\nan almost endless amount.\nA cautionary note, I once\nwent into the refrigerator\nand saw something similar to\nGut Shot, it wasn't Gut Shot.\nAnd I drank the whole 12 ounce bottle,\nand realized that it was 24 servings.\nAnd that's where I got\nmy initial experience\nwith what it is to not do a ramp up phase.\n- Yeah.\nI do not recommend\ndoing that.\nSome of these, it's very potent, it seems,\nand you can consume even a\nhalf an ounce or an ounce.\n- Yeah, I mean, very\npotent from the standpoint\nof fermentation, but also very salty.\nSo there's a lot of effects that can....\nYeah.\n- Yeah, don't do what I do,\n- Yeah.\n- At least not at the outset.\nSo that is an experienced warning.\nSo they did this, as I recall,\nthere was a swap condition or\nthere was a halt condition.\nSo you did controls, right?\nIt wasn't just comparing groups.\nYou had individuals in who\nwere initially in one group\nor the other moved to a\ndifferent group, correct?\nOr to stop and then return.\n- Yeah, we actually just did a stop\nand followed them during a washout phase.\nAnd the ideal situation for\ndietary interventions like this\nare to do crossover studies,\nas you're suggesting.\nWe've recently completed a ketogenic\nversus Mediterranean diet intervention-\n- Are those data published yet?\n- Not yet, but Christopher's been Tweeting\na lot of these data and\nthere's a paper in revision right now.\nSo if you go to Christopher\nGardner's Twitter feed,\nyou'll be able to find him reporting\nsome of the early results of this study.\n- Can you give us a snippet\nof, was there a superior...\nJust give us a, you don't\nhave to tell us which one,\nbut was there a superior condition\nof either Mediterranean versus ketogenic?\n- So the metabolic effects of\nthese, it's a beautiful study.\nI should let his group comment on that.\nThe microbiota data we actually\nare just generating now.\nSo the study that his group\nhas put together from this\nis largely independent\nof the microbiota data.\n- Right.\n- And now we're doing\na more in depth analysis,\nand I'll have more to say\nabout that the future.\n- We'll return to that, yeah.\n- But it's a super exciting study,\nbecause it is one of these\nwhere people eat a certain way.\nAnd what's really beautiful about this\nis we even got food delivered\nfor part of the intervention.\nSo we had complete control\nover what they at least\nhad available to eat.\nAnd then the second phase,\nthey make the food on their own.\nAnd then we cross over\nand do the same thing.\nAnd so that's really like,\nif you have a good enough budget,\nthe right way to do a study like this.\nFor this, we didn't have the time or money\nto do a crossover, but\nwe did do a washout phase\nwhere people, we didn't make\nthem stop eating, whatever,\nif they were enjoying\nit, but we monitored.\nAnd there was some recidivism\nwhere there was a decrease\nin fiber fermented food.\nAnd we could see, for instance,\ndiversity start to plateau and reverse\nin many of these people.\nSo there does appear to\nbe a need for maintenance\nof the intervention to maintain\nthe perceived health benefits\nthat we were measuring.\n- Great.\nWe will provide a link to\nthe study in the caption,\nand thank you for that very\nclear and thorough description,\nfrom one of the investigators\ninvolved in the study.\nIt's great to go direct to the source.\nAnecdotally, were there movements in mood,\nin resistance to colds and infection\nduring the course of the study?\nAnd this is kind of a prelude\nto where I'm headed next,\nwhich is there is a\ntremendous amount of interest\nin the so-called gut-brain axis.\nBut also I want to make\nsure that we talk about\nhow these microbes and the\nconditions they're establishing\nin the gut are creating positive\nor negative health effects.\nI mean, basically how\nsignals get out of the gut.\n- Totally. Yeah.\n- So I certainly notice\nthat when I'm eating\nmore fermented foods,\nor there's probiotics\nin drinks I consume and so forth,\nthat I feel quote, unquote, air quotes,\ncompletely subjective, I feel better.\n- Yeah.\n- I wish there was an objective\nmeasure of feeling better.\nBut I seem to think more\nclearly, sleep better,\nmood, et cetera, and I\nknow I'm not alone in that.\nAnd any time I've taken harsh\nantibiotics, I feel worse,\nbut then again, I'm usually taking them\nbecause I'm feeling bad\nabout something else, right?\nI don't take them just because.\nSo did people say they were\nfeeling better in any way?\nAnd if so, what did you have observe?\nAnd again, we're highlighting\nthese as anecdata.\n- Yeah, totally.\nWe, as part of this effort to look at\nhow dietary interventions\naffect our health and wellbeing,\nand so forth, and\nmicrobiome immune system,\nwe interact with a lot of\npeople who have read our book,\nor kind of have become\nmicrobiome enthusiasts.\nAnd have implemented\na lot of these changes\nin their personal life.\nAnd I hear the same thing\nthat you're saying, Andrew,\nthat tons of people say\nthey have more energy.\nThey think more clearly,\nthey sleep better,\ntheir family is nicer to each other,\nlike the number of crazy things.\nAnd it's really hard to uncouple, like,\nis this because these\npeople have taken charge now\nof what they're eating and\njust feel better in general\nfor being in control\nof what they're doing,\nor is there this cascading set of effects\nthat are actually impacting our...\nKind of emanating from the gut-brain axis.\nAnd so we actually implemented\na bunch of questionnaires\nand even a cognitive test to\ntry to get at some of this.\nAnd I should say, the list\nof this goes on and on.\nThere are people who claim\nthat their complexion improves,\nand that their allergies...\nAnd there's probably all\nsorts of ripple effects.\nIf you can affect your inflammation,\nwe know that you can\naffect your cognition,\nwe know that you can affect your skin\nand inflammation that's\noccurring on your skin.\nSo I really think that there is a basis\nfor a lot of those anecdotes.\nIt may just be hard to\nsee in a short study\nand in a small cohort of people\nover a short period of time,\nbut we didn't really\nsee significant things\nassociated with cognition and\nmoods and all of the things\nthat we were testing for which, yeah,\nthere could be a variety\nof explanations for that.\nWe also have a standardized\nstool measure that people use,\nand there was less constipation,\nbetter bowel movements over the course\nof both of these interventions.\nSo it did seem like bowel habits improved,\nwhich a lot of times can\nlead to better moods,\nbut that we weren't able to measure.\n- That the classic psychoanalyst\nwould have a few field day with that.\nWhat sorts of interesting\nthings did you observe\nin the fiber group?\nBecause it's clear that that group yielded\nsome unexpected findings\nin both directions.\nThings you expected to see, you didn't see\nto the same amplitude as you did\nin the fermented food group,\nbut I'm guessing you also saw\nsome very interesting things\nin the fiber group.\n- Totally, yeah.\nSo we started looking at\nthe data in more detail\nwhen we didn't see the\ncohort-wide response.\nAnd one of the things we\nobserved is that in measuring\nall these immune parameters,\nthere appeared to be\nthree different groups\nof immune responses that we were seeing.\nOne group that got\noverall less inflammatory,\nand then two other groups that\nkind of had a mixed result,\npartly more inflammatory,\npartly less inflammatory\nin all these markers\nthat we were looking at.\nAnd when we started digging\ninto like, what aspect\nof the biology of those people\ndictated or predicted\nwhich group they fell into,\nthe really interesting part is the people\nwith highest diversity gut\nmicrobiomes to start the study\nwere the ones that were\nmost likely to have\nthe decreases in inflammation.\nAnd so data seemed to be\ntelling us that if you start off\nwith a diverse microbiota,\nmaybe one that's better equipped\nto degrade a wide\nvariety of dietary fiber,\nyou're more likely to\nrespond positively to it.\nIf you have a very\ndepleted gut microbiome,\nyou're not as likely to\nbe able to respond to it.\nAnd thinking back to that\nexperiment that we talked about\nbefore with the multi-generational loss\nof fiber-fermenting microbes in mice\nthat were fed a Western diet,\nit may be that many of us\nin the industrialized world\nhave a microbiome that's so depleted now,\nthat even if we consume a high fiber diet,\nat least for a short period of time,\nwe don't have the right\nmicrobes in our gut\nto degrade that fiber.\nAnd this has actually been\nobserved by other groups,\nbeautiful study out of\nUniversity of Minnesota,\nlooking at immigrants,\ncoming to the United States.\nAnd within nine months,\nbut certainly over the course of years,\nimmigrants that come here lose\na lot of the diversity\nin their gut microbiome,\nbut a lot of the fiber-degrading capacity\nin their gut microbiome too.\nSo it could be that over time,\nthis becomes a one way street,\nand it's hard for us to recover microbes\nthat actually can degrade the fiber.\nAnd I think that this probably intersects\nwith sanitation in our environment,\nand the fact that we don't have access\nto new microbes that might\nhelp us degrade the fiber.\nThat we actually have lost these microbes,\nand they're in some ways irrecoverable\nwithout deliberate reintroduction\nof fiber-degrading microbes.\n- I can recall from childhood,\nthere were kids that would eat dirt.\n- Yeah.\n- And snails and stuff.\nThat just sounds totally disgusting,\nbu kids covered with mud\nmaybe not so much anymore.\nAnd certainly during the pandemic,\nthere's been and a lot more\nuse of these hand sanitizers,\nthat prior to that, people\nseemed pretty spooked about,\nbut then obviously they prioritized them.\nWell, you have children.\nDo you encourage them to...\nWhen they were young, did you\nencourage them to interact\nwith pets and dirt and-\n- Absolutely, yeah.\n- Stuff in the environment,\nprovided that stuff\nwasn't immediately toxic?\n- Exactly. So this is really...\nIt's a continual cost-benefit\nanalysis, I think.\nI will say that with the pandemic now,\nand certainly just with\ninfectious diseases in general,\nit's really important to\nbe aware of the possibility\nfor compromising your health\nthrough the spread of germs.\nAnd so that is just, hand\nwashing is important,\nand we have to be careful\nwith the spread of germs.\nBut I do think that the\nsanitization of our environment\nhas gone overboard with various things\nbeing impregnated with antibiotics,\nshopping carts and things\nlike that, and toothbrushes.\nIt's like antibiotics\nand things for killing\nmicrobes are everywhere.\nAnd when we were raising...\nWhen our daughters were young\nand we were making these decisions,\nthe calculations that we\nwould make were really one,\nhow likely are they to encounter\na disease-causing microbe?\nIf we've been out on a\nhike or in our garden,\njust kind of working in\nthe dirt or whatever,\nmaybe it's not as important\nto wash your hands\nbefore you have lunch,\neven if there's a little\nbit of dirt on them.\nIf they've been in a public playground\nwhere maybe other kids with germs,\nor maybe even chemicals like pesticides\nand herbicides that are being used,\nmaybe it's more important\nthan to wash your hands.\nCertainly if you've been\nin the grocery store\nor on the subway, probably a\ngood idea to wash your hands.\nSo I think you really need to think\nabout kind of the context of it.\nExposure to microbes from the environment\nis likely an important part of\neducating our immune system,\nand keeping the proper balance\nin our immune system.\nAnd it's just a matter of figuring out\nthe right way to do that safely.\nAnd it may be the fermented\nfood result that we saw\nis a way of tapping into\nthose same pathways,\nkind of an environmental\nexposure to microbes that's safe.\n- Interesting.\nI'd like to touch on how signals get\nfrom the gut to the rest of the body.\nAnd we probably don't have time to go\ninto all the systems that benefit\nfrom having a diverse microbiome\nor healthy microbiome.\nBut we talked about the immune system.\nThere's active signaling\nand transport from the gut,\nall along its length, as far as I know,\ninto the bloodstream, into\nother organs and tissues.\nSo for the immune system,\nit seems straightforward.\nIt could reduce the amount or number\nof inflammatory cytokines,\nlike IL-6 and so forth,\nmaybe increase the\nanti-inflammatory cytokines,\nlike IL-10 and others.\nBut we know there's a\ngut-brain access of neurons\nthat literally talk in both directions\nbetween brain and gut.\nBut let's say I'm eating\nmy fermented foods,\nI'm doing all the right things,\nand my gut is diverse and\nI have all the goodies\nat all the right places.\nHow is it that fact that\nthose microbiota are thriving\nis conveyed to the rest of the body?\nBecause they're in\nthere doing their thing,\nand I don't know that they have a mind,\nbut they're probably not thinking\nof taking care of me, Andrew.\nBut I feel better, or I\nmight get sick less often,\nor combat any illness more quickly.\nHow is that actually happening?\nIs it that the microbiomes\nstay restricted to the gut,\nbut the signaling molecules\nare all downstream,\nin a downstream way, are making\ngood or bad things happen?\nOr is there some sort\nof direct recognition\nat the body level, or are\nthere cells in the body\nthat are responding to, ah,\nthe gut microbiome is healthy,\nand therefore I can make\nmore of the good stuff,\nand less of the bad stuff, so to speak.\n- Yeah, great.\nYou're right, it's super complex.\nThere's a huge array of ways\nthat our body perceives both\nthe microbes and the molecules\nthat they produce in our gut,\nand the molecules they\nproduce are, of course,\na product of what microbes are there,\nand then what they receive\nas kind of metabolic inputs,\nwhat we're eating and what other microbes\nare present in the environment,\nproviding molecules to them.\nSo, it's this complex matrix, but we...\nProbably the simplest place to start\nis just the immune system.\nWe have an immune system that,\nthe vast majority of\nimmune cells in our body\nare located in our gut,\njust because there's\nsuch a dense population\nof microbes there that have...\nWe consider them beneficial microbes,\nbut they're only beneficial if they're\nin the right spot in the gut.\nAs soon as they mislocalize,\nwe know that they can become\nopportunistic pathogens.\nAnd so the immune system really\nplaying an important role\nto keep with them in place\nis essential for this system\nnot moving into a disease space.\nThe immune system has a variety of ways\nof monitoring what microbes are there.\nThey're actually specialized\nto structures in the gut\nknown as peyer's patches that\nactually take up microbes.\nThey actually allow microbes to transit\ninto this population of immune cells\nin a very controlled way,\nso that that set of immune\ncells becomes educated\nas to what microbes are just\non the other side of the barrier.\n- Wow, kind of like a border patrol.\n- Exactly, yeah.\nSo they bring them in,\nthey fingerprint them,\nand then have kind of\nthis set of responses\nready to go if needed.\n- [Andrew Huberman] Amazing.\n- There are other cells\nknown as dendritic cells,\nspecial type types that\nactually send long arms,\nthese processes out into\nthe lumen of the gut,\nand do the same thing, take up microbes,\nbring them back in and sample them.\nIn addition to these\ndirect sampling mechanisms,\nthe cells that line the gut\nhave a huge array of receptors,\nspecialized proteins,\nthat perceive patterns,\nmolecular patterns that the microbes make.\nSo things like endotoxin\nlipopolysaccharide,\njust the cell wall of the bacteria.\nWe have specialized receptors\nthat recognize those.\nIf those signals become too profound,\nor if they're perceived\nin the wrong place,\nthat can stimulate an\ninflammatory response.\nSo there's all these ways of\nmonitoring the membership,\nand where it is and how close it is.\nBut then there's this\nwhole other set of ways\nof perceiving metabolic activity,\nand what's happening in the gut.\nAnd you mentioned before,\nthese cell types, that express\ntaste receptors in the gut\nand have ways of sampling\ndietary components.\nThey're the same types of,\nor analogous cells in our gut\nthat are perceiving metabolites\nproduced by the microbiota\nso that our bodies can perceive\nwhat sort of metabolic\nactivity is going on.\nAnd then in addition to that,\nthere's this tremendously\nimportant nervous system\nthat's sending signals back to the brain,\ndictating things like motility.\nDo I get rid of what's in here?\nDo I move it along quickly?\nWhat actually is happening?\nDo I need to interact with immune cells?\nSo there's this really complex array\nof interactions between\nthe different cell types.\nAnd then a lot of the\ncells that are in the gut,\nperceiving all of these signals,\na lot of the immune cells can\nactually get up and leave.\nThey can get into the\nblood, cycle through,\nand then home to other regions\nof the mucosal surfaces,\nso that mucosal surfaces\nare educated broadly\nagainst what's passing through our gut.\nSo there's a variety of\nways of cells communicating,\nand then a lot of the molecules\nthat the microbiota makes\ncan actually make their way\ninto the bloodstream directly.\nAnd so the array of molecules\nis still being defined,\nwe're trying to figure out\nwhat all these chemicals are.\nWe've mentioned the\nshort-chain fatty acids,\nbut those are just the tip of the iceberg.\nThey are really interesting compounds\nlike indole derivatives and phenols,\nderived from amino acids,\nmetabolized by gut microbes,\ntaken up into the bloodstream.\nAnd then we further metabolize these,\nthey become kind of\nco-microbe host metabolites,\nand then they can go on and bind\nto different receptors\nthroughout our body,\nanywhere our bloodstream has access to,\nand start to trigger signaling cascades.\n- Is it known whether or\nnot any of those molecules\nare small enough to cross\nthe blood-brain barrier?\nBecause the hypothesis it\nand the current thinking\nis that neurotransmitters\nmanufactured in the gut,\nand signaling along the gut-brain axis,\nliterally neurons talking\nback and forth electrically\nfrom brain to gut and gut to brain\nis what regulates things like mood,\nor at least in animal models.\nAnd there are some emerging human studies,\nimprovement of symptoms in\nautism spectrum disorders,\nmaybe even in ADHD.\nWhat I'm basically saying here\nis there is some evidence emerging\nthat improving the gut microbiome\ncan improve outcomes in psychiatric\nand developmental disorders.\nBut what you're telling me is\nthat the microbiota themselves\nare manufacturing chemicals\nthat can make into the bloodstream.\nAnd therefore I'm asking\nif those chemicals\ncan move from the bloodstream\ninto the brain directly.\nIt may not be a gut-brain\naxis via neurons.\nIt actually could just be seepage\nof serotonin into the brain,\nor acetylcholine into the\nbrain for that matter.\n- Totally, yeah.\nThe biology of most of these molecules\nis not well understood,\nbut certainly in like\ncerebral spinal fluid\nthat's been analyzed,\nyou can perceive these\nmicrobial metabolites,\nso they are there.\n- That's the answer, yeah.\nSome of them are getting\nacross the barrier.\n- But so a really interesting thing is,\nI think a lot of these molecules are,\nif they're experienced\nat high enough doses,\nare toxic or have toxic properties.\nWe know that a lot of these metabolites,\nwhen they make their way\ninto the bloodstream,\neventually are excreted\nthrough the kidneys in urine.\nSo actually we can monitor the metabolism\nthat's going on in your\ngut by actually looking\nat the metabolites that\nare present in your urine,\nbecause many of those\noriginated in your gut,\nfrom your gut microbes.\nBut people with kidney disease,\nwhose kidneys' filtering processes\nis not functioning properly,\nactually build up high levels\nof many of these metabolites\ninto the bloodstream,\nand that can lead to\nmore of these molecules\nmaking it across the blood-brain barrier.\nAnd in fact, some of the\ntransporters in the kidney\nthat are responsible for\nshuttling these molecules\nout into urine, are also\nfounded the blood-brain barrier\nfor shuttling the molecules\nback into the bloodstream\nif they do get across.\n- Incredible.\n- And we know that mental\nfog one of the big symptoms\nof kidney disease, potentially\nbecause a lot of these\nmetabolites accumulate in blood,\nand then make their way\nacross the blood-brain barrier\ninto, yeah, the central nervous system.\n- Amazing. I'm glad you\nmentioned mental fog.\nA few years back, there were some reports,\nsome scientific reports and\nas a consequence in the media,\nthat excessive intake\nof pill-form probiotics\ncould create mental fog.\nI don't know if that ever took hold.\nAnd it raises a general question\nabout pill form probiotics.\nI took them for a few years,\njust thinking that would be\ngood for my gut microbiome,\nand then I switched to\nthe fermented food thing,\nlargely there's a consequence of the work\nthat you and Chris published.\nBut what what's the\nthought about probiotics\nfor the typical person\nthat's not recovering\nfrom a round of antibiotics\nor that has been prescribed them?\nI've heard that the species of microbiota\nthat they proliferate\nmight not be the species\nthat we want to proliferate,\nbut I've also heard that\nmaybe that doesn't matter.\nSo what's your general stance?\nThey can be quite expensive.\n- Yeah.\n- Also,\nI know I've been talking\nabout expense a lot today,\nbut I always want to take into account\nthat people are showing up to the table\nwith a variety of budgets,\nand probiotics are one\nof the more expensive\nsupplements out there.\nYou can quickly get into the\nseveral hundreds of dollars\nper month if you're\ngetting the quote, unquote,\nbest quality ones.\n- Right.\n- And if they're actually\ncausing brain fog,\nthen I'm not sure I'd want to use them.\n- No, completely.\nAnd there's a ton of snake oil out there.\nPeople know that they...\nI think many of these companies are aware\nthat they can prey off of people's fears\nand get a lot of money from\nthem with absolutely no data\nto back up that their\nprobiotic is doing anything.\nSo I think the first thing\nto say is buyer beware,\nbecause it's a supplement\nmarket, it's largely unregulated.\nAnd that means that there\nare a lot of bad products out\nthere, and a lot of products\nthat even though they're\nnot intended to be bad,\njust don't have great quality control.\nThere have been several\nstudies that have taken\noff the over the counter,\njust kind of off the shelf probiotics,\nsurveyed what's in there\nbased on sequencing\nand shown what is in there\ndoes not match what's on the label.\n- And that's true of many supplements,\nand unfortunately supplement companies.\nThis is something we get\ninto on the podcast a lot.\nThere are reputable brands and\nthey go through a lot of work\nto get things right, and there are many\nthat just for whatever reason,\nit just doesn't match what's listed.\n- Exactly, and so there are\nplaces that probiotic companies\ncan send their product to have\nit independently validated.\nSo you want to look for that sort\nof validation on a product.\nThere also are names that\nare just very well-known,\nand their reputations are on the line,\nso they probably invest a little\nbit more in quality control\nthan maybe some of the\nother, lesser-known names.\nBut there's a huge range\nof data on probiotics.\nAnd I think, the thing that\nwe kind of recommend is,\ntry to find good products and\nthen experiment for yourself\nand see if you can find\nsomething that works for you.\nI know people who have experienced\nconstipation and don't\nwant to change their diet,\nand have found a probiotic\nthat helps them with that.\nIf you can find that right mix, great.\nThat's wonderful.\nI would say that the data right now\nis not overwhelmingly positive\nfor what probiotics do\nto the gut microbiota.\nSo there have been some\nnice studies looking\nat the impact of probiotics on recovery\nafter antibiotic treatment.\nAnd it appears to slow down the recovery\nof the mucosal microbiota.\nAnd some other studies that\nhave where the big signal\nisn't seen, as you might hope,\nwith a probiotic that's supposed\nto treat a different disease.\nThere have been\nmetaanalysis that do suggest\nin certain instances, recovery\nfrom antibiotics that there,\neven though it may cause your microbiome\nto recover more slowly,\nthat it may actually\nprevent diarrheal disease,\nrecovery from viral diarrheas,\nprobiotics may help.\nBut because there's such\na huge range of products,\nand because each person\nis their own little caper\nwhen it comes to the microbiome,\nit's really hard to know\nwhether there are great products\nfor a given indication.\nThe really good advice that\nI've heard is try to find\na study that supports in...\nA really well designed\nstudy, and this is very hard\nfor people who aren't\nscientists to evaluate.\nBut so if you're experiencing\na medical problem,\nor want to consult a doctor,\nthat that might be helpful.\nBut finding a study where\na specific probiotic\nhas successfully done whatever\nit is you're looking for,\nand then sticking with that probiotic\nis really the best recipe\nas a place to start\nin this space, I think.\n- And what about prebiotics?\nIs there are a number of\nreasons why, I can imagine,\nthat prebiotics would be beneficial?\nWhich essentially it's, you're\npushing the fiber system,\nwhich we've talked a lot about today.\n- Yeah, yeah, absolutely.\nThe studies that have\nbeen done on prebiotics,\nit's really kind of a\nmixed bag of results.\nThere have been studies\ndone with purified fibers\nwhere you actually see\nmicro biodiversity plummet\nover the course of the study,\nbecause you get a very specific bloom\nin a small number of\nbacteria that are good\nat using that one type of fiber.\nAnd that's at the expense\nof all the other microbes\nthat are in the gut.\nAnd so it's really hard to\nreplicate with purified fiber\nwhat you'd get, for\ninstance, at a salad bar,\nin terms of the array\nof complex carbohydrates\nthat you would be exposing\nyour microbiota to.\nAnd I think the kind of\nbroad view of this in the field\nis that consuming a\nbroad variety of plants,\nand all the diverse fiber\nthat comes with that\nis probably better in fostering diversity\nin your microbiota than purified fibers.\nNow, there are, again,\na lot of people who benefit\nfrom purified fibers,\neither for GI motility or for\nother aspects of GI health,\nproblems that they've been experiencing.\nAgain, I think it's the type of thing\nwhere you have to try to find the thing\nthat's right for you.\nBut there also are studies that suggest\nthat if you layer rapidly\nfermentable fibers\non top of a Western diet,\nyou actually can result\nin weird metabolism\nhappening in your liver,\nbecause you have this incredibly\nrapid fermentation of fiber\nalong with a lot of fat\ncoming into the system.\nAt least that's the theory.\nAnd in a mouse study that was\npublished a few years ago,\nthey actually see that\na subset of the mice\ndevelop hepatocellular\ncarcinoma when they're fed\na high dose prebiotic-\n- Liver cancer.\n- Liver cancer, a on\ntop of a Western diet.\nSo whether that's\nrepresentative of human biology,\nwe don't know,\nbut purified fibers are\ndefinitely very different,\nboth in terms of the\ndiversity of structures,\nbut also in terms of how rapidly\nthey're fermented in the gut.\nBecause if you are eating plants,\nthe complex structures there\nreally slow the microbes down\nin terms of fermentation, and\nyou end up with a slow rate\nof fermentation over the\nlength of your colon,\nas opposed to this big burst\nof fermentation that can happen\nif you eat something\nthat is highly soluble\nand easily accessed by the microbes.\n- Interesting, so I guess,\nis it fair to come back to this idea?\nTry and avoid processed foods,\nthe highly palatable foods,\nthey're all sometimes super\nhighly palatable foods.\nThey're now called,\nthat are packed with\nhidden sugars, emulsifiers.\nSo it sounds like some fiber is good,\nand despite the outcome of the study,\nyou identified that if you have\nthe appropriate microbiota background,\nthen one will even better to the fiber,\nmaybe a longer ramp up\nphase for those folks,\nand then the fermented foods.\n'Cause there's no reason\nwhy you can't do both.\nAnd as we've talked about before,\na lot of fermented foods have fiber.\nSo you can kill two birds with one stone.\n- Totally.\nAnd it could be that the\ndiversity increase that we saw\nin the high fermented food\ngroup could be something\nthat would aid the high fiber group.\nAnd so now we're planning\nanother study coming up\nwhere we're doing high\nfiber, high fermented food,\nand then fiber plus fermented food,\njust to see if there's a\nsynergistic effect there.\n- Great, I want to enroll, seriously.\nAlthough I guess I'm biased,\n'cause I was sort of know\nwhere you're trying to..\nWell, is it blood draws that you use\nto measure the inflammatome?\n- Exactly, so we do blood draws-\n- [Andrew Huberman] Blood draws don't lie,\nso that's good.\n- Yep, yep, right.\n- So you've covered a tremendous\namount of information,\nand I'm incredibly grateful.\nThis was a area of biology,\nthat despite having learned\na lot about through papers\nand going to talks and\nreading articles in the media\nhas remained somewhat\nmysterious to me until today.\nYou've given us a very vivid picture\nof how this system works.\nWhere can people find out more\nabout the work that you're doing?\nWe can certainly provide links,\nand your wife who co-run your lab,\nyou have a book on this topic.\nSo could you tell us about the book,\nwhere we can learn more\nabout Sonnennburg Lab\nand the work that you're doing?\nMaybe people will even try and enroll\nin some of these studies.\n- Yeah, fantastic, yeah.\nIt'd be great if we could\nget people to enroll.\nWe're always looking for\nwilling participants.\nYeah, so Erica, my wife and I wrote a book\ncalled \"The Good Gut,\" and\nthat really was a response\nto how we were changing our lives\nin response to being in the field,\nbeing very familiar with the research.\nSeeing that a lot of our friends\nthat weren't studying that got microbiome,\nbut were very well informed,\nmany of them scientists,\nwere not doing the same\nthings we were doing.\nAnd it was very clear that it was just\nthe lack of information funneling out\nof the field to other people.\nAnd so we were wanted to make\nthat accessible to people\nwho are not microbiome scientists.\nThere's also a really interesting story.\nWe were at a conference site that just has\nscientific conferences all summer long,\nweek after week, after\nweek, different fields.\nAnd so it's people that work there\nthat are just dealing\nwith these new groups\ncoming in week after week and the week,\nwe were there for a microbiome conference,\npeople that work in the dining comments\ncame up to us and they said,\n\"What group is this? This is weird.\"\nAnd we're like, \"What's weird?\"\nAnd they said, \"We can't\nkeep the salad bar stocked.\"\nAnd it was very clear\nthat nobody was doing\nwhat we were doing until we'd\ngo to a microbiome conference\nand then everybody was\ndoing the same stuff\nthat we were doing.\nAnd so anyway, we wrote this book to talk\nabout our personal journey\nand the science in the field,\nand yeah, just to lay\na foundation for people\nif they want to start\nthinking about these changes.\nAnd then in terms of\nconnecting with our research,\ncertainly there's the Center\nfor Human Microbiome Studies\nat Stanford, which is\nkind of our home base\nfor doing a lot of these\ndietary and interventions.\nWe list the studies there,\ngive more information on what we're doing.\nAnd then we have a lab website too\nthat people can go to and\nread more about our research.\nYeah, and we're always looking\nfor participants for our studies.\n- Great, well, we will provide links\nto all of those sources.\nAnd I just want to say, thank\nyou so much for sharing with us\nyour knowledge for the incredible\nwork that you and Erica,\nyour wife and Chris do,\nand are continuing to do.\nI think this is an area that,\nwhen I started my training,\nI heard a little bit about microbiota,\nand I always just thought that are people\nthat work on infectious\ndisease and all the bad stuff.\nSo it's interesting and,\nand really important\nthat people realize that we're\ncarrying all this vital cargo\nand we need to take care of the cargo\nso it can take care of us.\nSo thank you so much for your time\nand for the work you do, and\nI hope we can do it again.\n- Thanks Andrew. This\nwas a great conversation.\n- Terrific.\nThank you for joining me\ntoday for my discussion\nwith Dr. Justin Sonnenburg,\nall about the gut microbiome\nand how to optimize your\ngut microbiome for health.\nPlease check out the\nSonnenburg Lab webpage,\nthat's Sonnenburg, spelled\nS-O-N-N-E-N-B-U-R-G-L-A-B\n.stanford.edu.\nThat's sonnenburglab.stanford.edu.\nThey often recruit for studies\nexploring how different\naspects of nutrition\nimpact the got microbiome,\nmuch as we discussed\nduring today's episode.\nPlease also check out the\nbook that he and his wife,\nDr. Erica Sonnenburg wrote,\ncalled \"The Good Gut.\"\nIt's readily available\non all the usual sites,\nsuch as Amazon and so forth.\nIf you're learning from and\nare enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero-cost\nway to support us.\nIn addition, please\nsubscribe to the podcast\non Apple and Spotify.\nAnd on Apple, you have the\nopportunity to leave us\nup to a five star review.\nYou can also leave a comment\non Apple, if you like.\nThe best place to leave us\ncomments and feedback, however,\nis on our YouTube channel\nin the comment section.\nThere you can suggest\ntopics that you'd like us\nto cover in future episodes,\nguests that you'd like us to interview,\nand give us feedback\nabout any of the material\nthat you've heard or\nwatched on this podcast.\nPlease also check out the sponsors\nmentioned at the beginning\nof today's episode,\nthat's the best way to\nsupport this podcast.\nWe also have a Patreon, it's\npatreon.com/andrewhuberman,\nand there you can support the podcast\nat any level that you like.\nOn many episodes of the\nHuberman Lab Podcast,\nincluding today, we discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements are certainly\nnot necessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them\nfor things like sleep and focus,\nand indeed gut microbiome support.\nThe one issue with supplements, however,\nis that many of the\nsupplement companies out there\ndo not independently\ntest their supplements.\nSo there isn't tremendous\nconfidence in all supplements\nthat they contain the\namounts of the ingredients\nthat are listed on the bottle,\nand that the quality of the ingredients\nis where it should be.\nFor that reason we've\npartnered with Thorne,\nthat's Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne supplements\nare known to have the very\nhighest levels of stringency\nwith respect to the\nquality of the supplements\nand the amounts of the supplements\nlisted on their bottles\nlist what's actually in the\ncontainers, which is essential.\nIf you'd like to see the\nThorne supplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\n.com/u/huberman, and you can get 20% off\nany of the Thorne supplements\nthat are listed there.\nAlso, if you navigate\ndeeper into the Thorne site\nthrough that portal,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\nThere I cover topics about\nscience and science-based tools,\nsome of which overlap with\nthe content of this podcast,\nmuch of which is separate and unique\nfrom the content of this podcast.\nWe also have a newsletter,\nit is called The Neural\nNetwork Newsletter.\nOnce a month, we put out short summaries\nof podcast episodes and key takeaways,\nactionable takeaways in particular.\nYou can sign up for that by\ngoing to hubermanlab.com.\nYou can look in the menu,\nlook for Neural Network Newsletter.\nYou can download previous\nnewsletters to take a look\nat what those are like and\nabout even before signing up.\nIf you subscribe,\nwe don't share your\ninformation with anybody.\nThe privacy policy is made\nvery clear at hubermanlab.com.\nSo thank you once again for joining me\nfor today's discussion\nabout the gut microbiome,\nand last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
