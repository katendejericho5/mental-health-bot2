    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[Upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about the biology,\npsychology and utility of play.\nPlay is something that\nnormally we associate\nwith children's games\nand indeed with being a child,\nmuch of our childhood\ndevelopment centers around play,\nwhether or not it's organized play\nor spontaneous play,\nbut as adults, we also need to play.\nAnd today I'm going to talk about\nwhat I like to refer to\nas The Power of Play.\nThe Power of Play,\nresides in plays ability\nto change our nervous system\nfor the better,\nso that we can perform many activities,\nnot just play activities, better.\nPlay can also function\nas a way to explore new ways of being\nin different scenarios in work,\nin relationships, in settings of all kind,\nand indeed also in the\nrelationship to oneself.\nIn fact,\nwe are going to explore how\nassuming different identities\nduring the same game of play\nor the same forms of play\nhas been shown to be immensely powerful\nfor allowing people\nto engage in more creative thinking\nand dynamic thinking and\nindeed to better leaders\nand more effective workers\nand students and learners\nand happier people.\nI'm also going to cover\nsome data that shows\nthat learning to play properly\ncan enhance one's ability to focus\nand is an active area of research\nfor treatment of things like ADHD,\nAttention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,\njust as a little sneak preview\nof where that's headed,\nchildren who do not access enough play\nduring certain stages of childhood\nare more prone to develop ADHD.\nThe good news,\nis all of us regardless of\nwhether or not we have ADHD\nor not,\nwhether or not we had ample access to play\nduring childhood or not,\ncan engage and grow the neural circuits\nthat allow for this\nincredible power of play.\nAnd this can be done again\nat any stage of life today.\nWe're going to talk about the protocols,\nthe science, we will review all of that.\nAnd I promise you'll come away\nwith a lot of knowledge,\nwhether or not you're a parent,\nwhether or not you're a child,\nwhether or not you're a person of any age,\nyou're going to have tools\nand knowledge that will benefit you.\nBefore we begin,\nI want to share with you\nthe results of what I think\nto be an extremely exciting\nand certainly an actionable study\nthat was just published in the\njournal Scientific Reports.\nThis is an excellent journal\nNature Press journal,\nPeer Reviewed, et cetera,\nand the finding center around\nwhat sorts of devices we\nhappen to be reading on\nand accessing information on\nand how that's impacting our physiology\nand our capacity to learn.\nOne of the more frequent questions I get\nis what are all these\ndevices, phones, tablets,\ncomputers, video games et cetera,\ndoing to our brains.\nAnd finally,\nthere's some good Peer reviewed data\nto look at that and to\naddress it directly.\nThis study, first author Honma\nH O N M A\nHonma et al,\nis entitled\n\"Reading on a smartphone\naffects sigh generation.\nThat's SIGH sigh generation\nbrain activity and comprehension.\"\nAnd to just summarize what they found,\nthey ran a study on 34 healthy individuals\nand had them either read\nmaterial on a smartphone\nor on regular printed paper or a book.\nAnd what they found is that\ncomprehension on devices\nin particular smartphones\nis much poorer much worse than it is\nwhen one reads on actual paper.\nNow some of you may\nexperience this yourselves.\nNow they compared smartphones with paper.\nAnd what they found was\nthat when they looked\nat people's breathing,\nthe normal patterns of breathing\nthat people were engaging in\ndid not differ between people\nreading on a smartphone\nor reading from paper.\nHowever, one particular feature\nof breathing did differ.\nAnd that particular\nfeature is what we call\nphysiological sighs.\nI've talked a lot about\nphysiological sighs on this podcast,\nand on social media,\nwe had a terrific guest,\nProfessor, Jack Feldman from\nUniversity of California Los Angeles.\nWho's a world expert in\nbreathing and respiration\nand its impacts on the brain\nand how brain controls\nbreathing and respiration\nand what you can learn from that episode.\nOr I'll just tell you again right now,\nis that every five minutes or so,\nwhether or not we are asleep or awake,\nwe do what's called a physiological sigh,\nwhich is a big, deep inhale,\noften a double inhale\nfollowed by a long exhale.\nIt goes something like this.\n[Inhaling]\n[Sighs]\nNow you might think, oh,\nI never breathe like that,\nbut you do,\nunless there's something severely\nwrong with your brain stem\nevery five minutes or so\nyou do one of these physiological sighs,\nwhich reopens all the little\nhundreds of millions of sacks\nin your lungs called alveoli\nthat bring in more oxygen\nas a consequence of that\nbig deep, double inhale.\nAnd then you are able to\nexhale carbon dioxide,\noffload carbon dioxide\nthrough that long exhale.\nI've also encouraged people\nto use the physiological sigh\ndeliberately,\nnot just spontaneously\nas a way to reduce their stress quickly.\nAnd indeed my lab works\non physiological sighs\nand it's been exploring this\nand they're quite effective in reducing\nour stress very fast.\nReading on our smartphone,\nseems to suppress physiological sigh.\nPeople aren't aware that it's happening,\nbut it's happening.\nSome people have talked\nabout so-called email apnea,\nwhich is the fact that\npeople hold their breath\nwhile they email or while they text.\nAnd indeed many people do that.\nThis is distinct from\nemail or texting apnea.\nWhat's happening here is\npeople are reading on the phone\nand for whatever reason,\nand I'll talk about what\nthe likely reason is,\nbut for whatever reason,\nthey're suppressing their sighing\nAnd as a consequence,\nthe brain is not getting enough oxygen\nand is not offloading\nenough carbon dioxide.\nAnd another finding in this study,\nwas that the prefrontal cortex,\nan area of the brain that's\ninvolved in focus and attention\nand learning\nbecomes hyperactive in a kind\nof desperate attempt to focus.\nAll of this can be summarized by saying,\nif you happen to read on a device,\nwhether or not it's a tablet,\na standard computer screen of any kind,\nbut in particular on a smart phone,\nregardless of how small or\nlarge that smartphone screen is,\nyou want to remind yourself\nto engage in these physiological\nsighs fairly regularly.\nAnd it might even be better to just\nread the most or at least the key issues\nand things that you're trying to learn\nabout the key information from paper,\neither books or printed out material\nof some other sort.\nWhat's the underlying mechanism here?\nWell,\none of the reasons I\nlike this study so much,\nis that it brings together\ntwo of my laboratories\nand my particular\ninterests in neuroscience,\nwhich is how does our visual system\nand the aperture meaning the\nsize of our visual window\nrelate to our so-called autonomic function\nor our internal state.\nAnd basically what's happening here is\nas any of us bring our visual\nwindow in more narrowly\nas we contract our visual window,\nwhich is exactly what happens\nwhen we're looking at a little\nsmartphone in front of us.\nIt seems to suppress\nthe breathing apparatus\nbecause we know that physiological sighs\nare controlled by a\nspecific set of neurons\nin the brain stem called\nthe parafacial nucleus\ndiscovered by Dr. Jack Feldman.\nAnd so there must be a mechanism whereby\nwhen we tighten our visual window,\nwe somehow, and we don't\nknow yet how this happens,\nbut somehow suppress the\nactivity of these neurons\nin the parafacial nucleus\nthat generate this physiological sighs.\nSo again,\nyou have two choices or I\nsuppose you have many choices,\nbut two main choices\nto contend with this new information.\nOne is that you remind yourself\nto engage in deep breathing\nand in particular, physiological sighs\nevery five minutes or so,\nwhile reading anything or\ntexting on your smartphone,\nthe other would be,\nagain, if there's material\nthat you really need to learn\nfor sake of regurgitation later,\nor for something particularly important,\ntry and read that from\neither a larger screen\nor even better would be from\nprinted materials or books.\nAnother reason I bring all that up\nis that it relates to a larger theme,\nwhich is that I get many,\nmany questions about ADHD\nand about people's challenges with focus\nand much of what we're\ntold these days is that\nwe are challenged with focus\nbecause of the hundreds of videos\nthat we can see streaming by\nus in any moment on our phone,\nwhich probably is true.\nThe fact that the information\nthat we're reading\non the internet and on our phones\nis emotionally disturbing\nor distressing in some way.\nAnd that probably is true\nas well in many cases.\nThis study really points to\nthe fact that independent\nof the information that we are looking at\nor consuming\nindependent whether or\nnot it's movies or texts\nor anything of that sort,\nthe mere size of the window, the aperture,\nthe screen that we are looking at\nis also strongly impacting\nour ability to learn\nand remember information.\nSo broaden that visual window\nprint things out,\nlook at a book.\nI didn't design the system.\nI always say, you know,\nhowever our visual system\nand respiratory system\nhappened to evolve.\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase.\nThis is just simply how\nyour brain circuits work.\nSo if you want to learn things,\nwiden that visual window and\neven better print things out,\npick up a book or read on a tablet even,\nbut try and make that tablet larger\nthan a smartphone screen size.\nBefore we begin our discussion\nabout The Power of Play,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however,\npart of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public\nin keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens also now called AG1.\nI started drinking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nAnd so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nAthletic Greens is an all in one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nThe reason I started drinking it in 2012,\nand the reason that I still\ndrink it once or twice a day,\nis that with Athletic Greens,\nI cover all of my basic\nfoundational vitamin mineral\nprobiotic needs.\nIt's filled with adaptogens for recovery.\nThe probiotics are particularly important\nbecause they encourage health\nof the so-called gut microbiome.\nWe're going to be talking a\nlot about the gut microbiome\non this podcast in the\nweeks and months to come,\nbut to make a long story short,\nwe have a lot of bacteria\nliving in our gut\nthat are healthy bacteria\nthat support them like\ndigestion immune system,\nmetabolic function, hormone systems.\nAnd perhaps most interestingly to me,\nthe gut microbiome\nsupports brain function,\nincluding mood cognition and so forth.\nThe probiotics in Athletic Greens\nstrongly support the gut microbiome\nand thereby the other systems of the body,\nincluding the gut brain access,\nwhich I just referred to.\nIf you like to try Athletic Greens again,\nalso called AG1,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey're giving away five free travel packs\nand a year supply of vitamin D3, K2,\nvitamin D3 is extremely important\nfor many biological functions.\nWe are told that we can get\nenough D3 from sun exposure,\nbut many of us we're getting sun exposure.\nAnd many of us who are not\ngetting enough sun exposure\nstill don't have ample\nlevels of vitamin D3\nSo supplementing with\nvitamin D3 is necessary\nfor many many people.\nAnd K2 is important for\ncardiovascular function\nfor proper calcium balance, et cetera.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can get the five free travel packs\na year supply of vitamin the D3 K2,\nand of course your Athletic Greens.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system.\nAnd one of the many challenges\nthat your visual system\nhas to deal with\nis for instance, when you\nmove from a bright environment\nto a dimer environment, you have to adapt.\nYou have have to be able\nto see things clearly,\nmany sunglasses and eyeglasses\ndon't allow that adaptation\nto occur seamlessly,\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\nallow that to occur in\nconcert with your biology\nand in a way that makes it very seamless.\nYou just don't notice\nthe transition at all,\nwhich is wonderful.\nI love it 'cause I don't have\nto constantly be taking off\nand putting on my\nsunglasses when I'm outside.\nI happen to wear readers at\nnight, eye glass readers.\nIt's also terrific as the luminance\nin your environment changes.\nSo they work under low luminance,\nhigh luminance, et cetera.\nThey're very lightweight.\nIn fact, you can wear them\nwhen running, when cycling,\nthey were designed by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford.\nAnd so originally they were designed\nfor the purpose of being\nworn during exercise,\nbut you can wear them anywhere.\nThey have a great aesthetic,\nso you can wear them to dinner,\nto work, et cetera.\nAnd while a lot of performance\neyeglasses out there,\nin my opinion, make\npeople look like cyborgs,\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\nhave just a terrific aesthetic\nthat you can wear truly anywhere.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to roka.com that's ROKA.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nto get 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA ROKA.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nat checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are second to none.\nI started sleeping on a Helix\nmattress about a year ago now,\nand it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nWhat's unique about Helix mattresses\nis that they tailor their\nmattresses to your sleep needs.\nSo if you go to their website,\nyou can take a brief two minute quiz\nthat asks questions like,\ndo you sleep on your stomach\nor your back or on your\nside, maybe you don't know,\ndo you tend to run hot or\ncold throughout the night?\nOr maybe you don't know,\nand it matches you to the mattress.\nthat's perfect for your sleep needs.\nI matched to the so-called Dusk mattress,\nD U S K,\nbecause I wanted a mattress\nthat wasn't too firm\nand not too soft.\nAnd so I sleep on a Dusk mattress.\nYou should figure out what\nmattress would be ideal for you.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two minute sleep quiz\nand the match you to\na customized mattress.\nAnd you'll get up to $200 off\nany of your mattress orders\nand two free pillows.\nAgain, that's $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nThe pillows are excellent.\nI also use Helix pillows.\nThey have a 10 year warranty.\nYou get to try out the mattress\nfor up to a hundred nights, risk free.\nIf you don't like it,\nthey'll come pick it up,\ntake it away.\nBut I think you'll love it.\nAgain if interested,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.\nThere can get up to $200 off\nand the two free pillows.\nLet's talk about play.\nNow in researching this episode,\nI thought that I was going to\ncome across a bunch of papers\nthat say this brain area\nconnects to that brain area,\nwhich controls play in animals.\nAnd there's similar areas\nin babies and in adults.\nAnd indeed, that's true.\nAnd we will talk about brain circuitry,\nbut I think more\nimportantly is to understand\nwhat is the utility of play?\nYou know, why do we\nplay when we're younger?\nWhy do we tend to play\nless as we get older?\nAnd what in the world is play for?\nSome of us would be\ncategorized as more playful.\nI'm sure that you know, people like this,\nmaybe you are like this\npeople that can walk into a room,\na social setting of any kind,\nand they seem to already\nkind of have a playful,\nmaybe even a mischievous\nquality about them.\nWe'll talk about mischief\na little bit later,\nbut they sort of look at an environment\nor a social setting as an opportunity\nfor different kinds of novel interactions.\nOther people and I'd probably\nput myself into this category.\nIf I walk into a novel environment,\nI tend to be more in the\nmode of just assessing\nwhat that environment is like.\nI'm not a particularly\nspontaneously playful person,\nalthough around certain individuals,\nI might be more spontaneously playful.\nWe are all on a continuum\nof this kind of seriousness\nto playful nature.\nTurns out that all young animals,\nincluding humans\nhave more playfulness and tend to engage\nin more spontaneous play\nin their earlier years\nthan in their later years.\nAnd therein lies a very interesting portal\nto understanding what the utility,\nwhat the purpose of play is.\nFirst of all,\nI want to lay down a couple\nof key facts about play\nthat point to the fact that\nplay is not just about games.\nPlay is about much, much more\nand play and in particular,\nhow we played as a child\nand still how we can play as adults\nis really how we test\nand expand our potential roles\nin all kinds of interactions.\nOne of the most important,\ninteresting and surprising\nfeatures of play\nthat I'd like everyone to know about\nis that it is homeostatically regulated.\nSome of you are familiar\nwith the term homeostasis.\nHomeostasis is just this\naspect of biological systems\nto try and remain in balance.\nYou know, if you stay awake\nfor a long period of time,\nyou tend to want to sleep\nfor a long period of time.\nIf you slept for a long period of time\nand you're very rested,\nthen you tend to be very\nenergetic the next day.\nAnd of course, I know people\nout there will immediately say,\noh, well, if I sleep too long,\nthen I'm groggy the next day.\nOf course there are exceptions,\nbut in general,\nsleep and wakefulness are\nin homeostatic balance.\nThirst and water consumption\nare in homeostatic balance.\nIf you don't drink any fluids for a while,\nyou tend to get more thirsty,\nyou drink fluids\nand your thirst tends to diminish\nlikewise with food.\nLikewise, with most all\nmotivated behaviors.\nWell,\none of the most important discoveries\nof the last century,\nwas largely the work of a\nguy named Jaak Panksepp.\nNo, it's not Jack it's Jaak Panksepp\nwho really pioneered this understanding\nof the biology of play\nand relating that to\nthe psychology of play\nin animals and humans.\nHe's considered kind of\nluminary in the field of play,\nand what a great title to have, right?\nIf you could have a title\nand be a scientific luminary,\nyou might as well be the, the play guy.\nIn fact he was known and I'll\nget into this later as to why,\nbut he was known as the \"Rat Tickler\"\nbecause he tickled rats.\nAnd he actually found that\nrodents and animals of many kind\ngenerate laughter in response to tickling.\nAnd in fact,\nthey don't have the capacity\nto tickle themselves\nsomething we'll also\ntalk about why that is.\nAnd he was called the \"Rat tickler,\"\nbut then he discovered that\nmany species of animals\nengage in laughter in response to tickling\nand they tickle each other.\nAnd the reason you don't\nhear them laughing,\nno you can't hear your dog laughing\nthat isn't laughing it's something else\nis that most animals besides humans laugh\nat kind of ultrasonic\nlevels of auditory output.\nMeaning the frequencies\nof sound are just too high\nfor you to hear,\nbut with the appropriate devices,\nhe was able with his colleagues\nto isolate this so-called\nthe \"Rat Laughter\"\nand then turns out there's kitten laughter\nand there's puppy laughter.\nAnd of course there's human laughter.\nSo Jaak Panksepp was a very interesting\nand pioneering person in this field.\nAnd he also discovered that play\nis homeostatically regulated.\nMeaning if animals including children\nare restricted from playing\nfor a certain amount of time,\nthey will play more when\ngiven the opportunity\nin the same way that\nif I food restrict you\nfor a long period of time,\nyou'll eat more when you\nare finally allowed to eat.\nNow this is important\nbecause it moves this thing that we call\nplay from the dimension\nof higher order functions\nor things evolved recently,\nyou know, that are really\nkind of at the front edge\nof human evolution,\ndeeper into the circuitry of the brain,\nwhereby we say the brain stem,\nthe kind of ancient parts of the brain\nare going to be involved.\nAnd in fact, that's the case\nas we're going to learn\nlater in the podcast,\nplay is generated through the connectivity\nof many brain areas.\nBut one of the key brain areas\nis an area called PAG Periaqueductal Gray.\nThe Periaqueductal Gray\nis a brain stem area.\nSo it's pretty far back\nas the brain kind of transitions\ninto the spinal cord.\nAnd it's rich with neurons\nthat make endogenous opioids.\nSo these are not the kinds of opioids\nthat are causing the opioid crisis.\nThese are neurons that you and I all have\nthat release endogenous, meaning self-made\nor biologically made opioids.\nThey go by names like enkephalin\nand things of that sort.\nPlay evokes small amounts of\nopioid release into the system.\nThey kind of dope you up a little bit,\nnot so much as one would see if\none were to take exogenous opioids.\nAnd in fact exogenous\nopioids as we now know,\nare potentially very hazardous,\nhighly high addiction potential\nhigh overdose potential.\nThey cause all sorts of problems.\nYes there are clinical uses for them,\nbut they're causing a\nlot of problems nowadays,\nbut these endogenous opioids\nare released in children and adults\nanytime we engage in play.\nAnd that turns out to be a\nvery important chemical state\nbecause there's something about\nhaving an abundance of\nthese endogenous opioids\nreleased into the brain\nthat allows other areas of the brain,\nlike the prefrontal cortex,\nthe area of the front that's responsible\nfor what we call executive function.\nExecutive function is the\nability to make predictions,\nto assess contingencies.\nLike if I do this,\nthen that happens.\nIf I do that, then that happens.\nWell prefrontal cortex is often seen\nas a kind of rigid executive\nof the whole brain.\nThat's one way to view it,\nbut probably a better way to view it\nis that the prefrontal cortex works\nin concert with these other\nare more primitive circuitries.\nAnd when the periaqueductal gray releases\nthese endogenous opioids during play,\nthe prefrontal cortex, doesn't get stupid.\nIt actually gets smarter.\nIt develops the ability\nto take on different roles\nand explore different contingencies.\nAnd we're going to talk about role play\nlater in different contexts.\nAnd what we will find\nis that so much of play\nis really about exploring things in a way\nthat feels safe enough to explore, right?\nThis is not what happens\nwhen we drive down the street\nor when we bike down the street,\nwhen we are headed to work,\ncommuting on our bicycle\nor walking or driving,\nwe tend to be very linear\nand we tend to be very goal directed.\nWe're not going to just take\na new street just because\nwe're not going to be\nspontaneously riding in the middle\nof the road\nand then on the sidewalk\nand then back and forth.\nAlthough I can remember as a kid,\nI was doing some of that.\nI like to jump off curb\ncuts when I was a kid.\nAnd then eventually I\ngraduated, sorry to the cyclist,\nbut I graduated to skateboarding.\nAnd then I look on skateboarding.\nYou're always kind of exploring terrain,\nbut you know, as I got older,\nactually I find myself\nbecoming much more linear.\nI just don't play with\nmy commute very much.\nIt's really just about getting\nto work and then working.\nWhen endogenous opioids are in our system,\nwhen we're in this mode of play,\nthe prefrontal cortex starts seeing\nand exploring many more\npossibilities of how we interact\nwith our environment,\nwith others and the roles that\nwe can assume for ourselves.\nAnd so we're going to dissect one by one,\nthe different aspects of play,\nrole play, social play,\nindividual play, imaginary\nplay, competitive play\nthey are enormous number\nof dimensions of play.\nAnd by the end of this episode,\nwe are going to arrive\nat a very key feature.\nThe key feature is one that's called\nyour personal play identity.\nAll of us have what we call\na personal play identity.\nThis personal play identity\nwas laid down during development.\nAnd it is the identity that you\nassume in playful scenarios.\nAnd it is identity that you\nadopt in non playful scenarios.\nNow the great news is that\nyour personal play identity\nis plastic throughout\nyour entire lifespan.\nYou can adjust your personal play identity\nin ways that will benefit\nyou in work in relationships\nand your overall level of happiness.\nWe will discuss protocols\nand ways to do that.\nBut I do want to give\na nod to the late jack,\nJaak excuse me,\nJaak Panksepp, \"The rat tickler.\"\nAnd I also want to just give\na nod to play generally,\nas we move forward in the discussion.\nWhat I'd love for everyone to do\nis to stop thinking about\nplay as just a child activity,\nnot just a sport related activity,\nbut really as an exploration\nin contingencies.\nAgain, it's an exploration of,\nif I do A, what happens?\nIf I do B, what happens?\nIf someone else takes on\nbehavior or attitude C\nwhat am I going to do?\nAnd play is really where\nwe can expand our catalog\nof potential outcomes,\nand it can be enormously enriching.\nAnd indeed as we'll talk about\nthe tinkerers of the world,\nthe true creatives,\nthe people that building\nincredible technologies and art,\nand also that just have incredibly rich,\nemotional and intellectual\nand social lives\nall have a strong element of play.\nAnd so today I hope to convince you\nof some protocols that\nwill allow you to expand\nyour various roles in life,\nthrough the portal of play.\nSo we establish that play is homeostatic,\nmeaning we all need to do it.\nMany of us, including myself,\nhaven't played that much as adults.\nWe're all pretty busy.\nNumber of us are stressed.\nWe got a lot to do in life,\nbut as children,\nmost all of us engage in a lot of play.\nAnd in looking at the way\nthat very young children\nand especially toddlers play,\nwe can learn a lot\nbecause it reveals the fundamental rules\nby which the toddler brain\ninteracts with the world.\nNow,\none of the key things\nabout the baby brain\nis that the baby brain somehow\nknows that it can't do\neverything in the world, right?\nIf a baby needs something,\nit generally will cry or make\nsome sort of vocalization\nor some sort of facial expression\nor combination of those.\nAnd the caretaker, whoever\nthat may be will provide it.\nThis is an ancient hard wired mechanism\nwhereby the so-called\nautonomic nervous system\nthat generates stress\nwill create this kind of\nwhining and discomfort,\nmaybe arriving,\nmaybe the baby gets\nkind of red in the face\nand the caretaker delivers some thing\nbased on a good guess\nof what that baby needs.\nSo maybe it's breast milk,\nmaybe it's bottle milk.\nMaybe it's a diaper change.\nMaybe it's to be warmed\nup if the baby is cold,\nmaybe it's to be cooled\ndown if the baby's too warm,\nmaybe if the baby's in\nits a little onesie thing,\nit's feeling restricted\nand it just wants to move\nand they'll get taken out of their,\ntheir crib or their stroller,\nwhatever it is and allowed\nto stretch out on the floor.\nRemember the baby doesn't\nknow exactly what it needs.\nIt only knows the state of discomfort.\nAnd of course we don't know\nexactly what babies and toddlers\nare thinking\nbecause they can't express\nthemselves with language yet.\nBut what's key to understand\nis the rule or the\ncontingency that is set up\nin that scenario.\nIn that scenario,\nthe child feels some discomfort\nexpresses that discomfort verbally\nor through a facial expression or both\nand then some force some\nperson from the outside world\nresolves it.\nAnd so the very young baby\nand indeed many children\nup to certain ages\nand let's confess many adults\nare not able to meet or\nadjust their internal states\nof stress.\nAnd so they look to\nthings outside of them.\nThat's the first rule,\nthe fundamental rule\nthat we all learn when we come into life,\nthat when in a state of discomfort\nto look outside our immediate biology,\nbeyond the confines of our\nskin and find a solution,\na sip of water for adults,\nit might be sip of alcohol,\nright?\nProbably not the best\ntool to relieve stress,\nbut that's one that many people do.\nIn fact engaging for\nthe baby that's hungry.\nThe bottle milk comes from the outside.\nAs we gain more proficiency\nin moving through life\nand we can get things for ourselves.\nWe still often bring things\nfrom the external world in\nto resolve this what I'm calling\nautonomic discomfort or\nautonomic dysregulation.\nThat's not a game, but that's a rule.\nAs we advance from infant to toddler,\nwe start to think more\nin terms of where we are\nand what we own relative to\nwhat's out there in the world.\nAnd now in the world of child psychology,\nthere's a somewhat famous poem\nthat was written by a\nresearch child psychologist.\nHis name was Burton White,\nand he wrote a poem called\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\n\"The Toddlers Creed\" defines well,\nwhat the rules and\ncontingencies of play are\nin very young children.\nAnd it reveals to us just how narrow\nand limited their world view is\nand how self entered their world is.\nSo \"The Toddlers Creed\" read quickly,\ncuz' I don't want to take up\ntoo much time with this is.\n\"If I want it.\nIt's mine.\nIf I give it to you and\nchange my mind later,\nit's mine.\"\nFor anyone that's played with a toddler,\nyou can imagine this in your mind.\n\"If I can take it away\nfrom you, it's mine.\nIf I had a little while ago, it's mine.\nIf we are building something together,\nall the pieces are mine.\nIf it looks just like mine,\nit's mine.\nIf it's mine, it will never\nbelong to anyone else,\nno matter what.\"\nAnd of course, as we hear this\nsounds quite awful, right?\nAnd yet this is actually\na reflection of what\na healthy toddler would\nthink about the world.\nThat the objects and things,\nand even the people in\nthe world are theirs,\nthat they are actually\npossessions that belong to them.\nNow of course,\nsome people never actually\ntransition beyond this stage\nof moral and social development.\nAnd there are indeed some adults\nthat fit \"The Toddlers Creed.\"\nAnd you're welcome to\nshare this with them.\nIf ever you think that\nit might be of benefit\nto their self-reflection.\nBut in all seriousness Burton White's\n\"Toddlers Creed\" is really grounded\nin this transition from\nwhen we are infants.\nAnd we have to have\nthings delivered to us,\nto the point where we are toddlers\nand we can access things in the world,\nbut we tend to assume\nthat they are all ours.\nAnd then the next stage\nis the really key stage\nas it relates to play\nbecause is in the next\nstage of development\nis where young children start\nto interact with other children\nand there's an exchange and a possession\nand then a letting go of certain things,\nlearning that not everything is yours\nand that the entire world is not about you\nis one of the key contingencies\nthat is established during play.\nIt's one of the key way\nin which children go\nfrom being very self-centered\nand basically unable to\nengage with other kids\nfor very long,\nwithout some sort of eruption of crying\nand some sort of battle of, you know,\nkind of push pull over an object\nto things like sharing and\nthings like cooperative play.\nSo as we transition from forms of play\nthat are all about the self\nthat are all me, me, me, me,\n\"The Toddlers Creed\"\nto forms of play that involve\nsome discomfort in assuming roles\nthat maybe we don't want and\nnot getting what we want.\nIt's really an opportunity for the brain\nto start to explore different\nroles that people take,\nhow they work as individuals\nand as pairs and in larger groups.\nAnd to do that in a low\nstakes environment, right?\nYou wouldn't want this to be worked out\non the battlefield or\nwhen searching for food\nor in some high stakes environment\nwhere the survival of the\nspecies was important.\nIt appears that these\ncircuitry for play evolved.\nSo that rules and contingencies\naround who's most important,\nwhether or not the group is important,\nwhether or not individuals\nare going to be leaders\nor followers, et cetera,\nthat can be explored in\na low stakes environment.\nNow there are hundreds of\ndifferent types of play\nand hundreds of different\ntypes of contingency testing.\nBut the key theme here is that\nplay allows children and\nadults for that matter\nto explore different outcomes\nin a kind of low stakes environment.\nIf you're playing a board\ngame or a card game,\nyou might get really into that game,\nbut unless there's a lot of\nmoney on the table, so to speak,\nor you're really playing\nfor something important\nor unless your ego is swollen\nway out of proportion,\nto reality,\nif you lose, you might\nnot feel good about it,\nbut it's truly not the end of the world.\nAnd if you win,\nyou might feel really good about it,\nbut you're not really incredible.\nYou were just incredible in\nthat particular situation\nfor that particular moment,\nit doesn't really transform\nthe rest of your life,\nunless that game is of a\nparticular type for sport\nfor instance.\nWe'll talk about sport later.\nSo the key theme here is that\nplay is contingency testing.\nplay is contingency\ntesting under conditions\nwhere the stakes are sufficiently low,\nthat individuals should feel comfortable\nassuming different roles,\neven roles that they're\nnot entirely comfortable\nwithin their outside life.\nAnd that all relates again\nto the release of these\nendogenous opioids,\nin this brain center periaqueductal gray\nand the way that it allows\nthe prefrontal cortex\nin a very direct way I mean,\ntruly it allows it in a biological way\nto expand the number of\noperations that it can run,\nand start thinking about, oh, well, okay.\nNormally I'm kind of a loner\nand I like to read and work\nand you know, hang out\nalone maybe and play alone\nbut you know okay,\nI'll play a board game\nor a game of tennis\nwhere I have a partner and\nwe're going to play as partners\nagainst two other people.\nOkay, that's a little\nuncomfortable, but I'll do it.\nAnd in doing that,\nyou discover certain ways\nin which you are\nproficient in certain ways,\nin which you are less proficient,\nyou discover that the other person\nactually tends to cheat a little bit\nor the other person is\nextremely rigid about the rules,\nor maybe it is extremely rigid\nabout the way they organize\ntheir pieces on the board,\nor they're crossing the line\ninto your side of the tennis court.\nThere are all sorts of\nthings that we learn\nin these rather low stake scenarios.\nThat's the key theme here.\nSo before I continue,\nI just want to point to a\ntool that anyone can use,\nbut in particular, the\nless playful of the group.\nAnd I would put myself into this category.\nAgain, I'm not somebody who really engages\nin spontaneous play.\nI enjoy sports.\nI enjoy exercise,\nbut that is distinct from play\nbecause the sports and\nexercise that I engage in,\nI take pretty seriously.\nThey're not low stakes for me.\nI put actually I put a\nlot of importance on them.\nWhich is I'm saying all this,\nI probably should put a\nlittle less importance on them\nand have a little more fun with those.\nAnd yet what I'm about to tell you is that\nanyone and everyone can\nbenefit from engaging\nin a bit more of this playful mindset,\nthe playful mindset is not necessarily\nabout smiling and jumping\naround or being silly.\nThat's not it at all.\nIt's not Tigger character\nfrom \"Winnie the Pooh\" necessarily.\nIt could be,\nbut it's really about allowing yourself\nto expand the number of outcomes\nthat you're willing to entertain\nand to think about how you relate\nto those different outcomes.\nSo what this means is putting yourself\ninto scenarios where\nyou might not be the top performer, right?\nPlaying a game that you're\nnot really that good at.\nI had this experience recently,\nfriends that like to play cards,\nthey like to do some low stake gambling.\nThis is non illegal gambling ring.\nThey play for trivial things.\nAnd I generally don't buy into the game.\nI generally don't play\nmostly because they end\nup winning and taking\nwhatever it is that I have.\nBut in the mode of assuming\na more playful spirit,\nthe idea would be well,\nif the stakes are low enough,\nthen to play simply for\nthe sake of playing,\nbecause there's something to learn there\nabout the other people in the group\nand about one's self\nand how one reacts to things like\nsomeone who's clearly trying\nto take everybody's money\nor somebody who is clearly trying to cheat\nor somebody who's clearly very, very rigid\nabout every last detail,\nincluding how the cards are\ndealt and shuffled right?\nThere is learning in this exploration.\nAnd that is at a biological\nlevel, the prefrontal Cortex,\nstarting to entertain\ndifferent possibilities,\nstarting to entertain different outcomes\nin this low stakes way.\nAnd if you think about it,\nthat's not something\nthat we allow ourselves\nto do very often.\nEven if we listen to new forms of music\nor we go see new art or new movies,\nthose are new experiences,\nbut that's not us making new predictions\nabout what's going to happen next.\nIt's not the brain working to figure out\nnew possibilities.\nAnd so you can immediately see how\njust a small increase in your willingness\nto put yourself into conditions\nwhere you don't understand\nall the rules perhaps,\nor you're not super\nproficient at something,\nbut you enter it\nbecause it is low stakes.\nAnd because there is information to learn\nabout yourself and others\ncould start to open up these\nprefrontal cortex circuits.\nAnd when I say open up,\nI don't mean that literally\nthere's an opening\nin your skull.\nWhat I mean is that your prefrontal cortex\ncan work in very rigid ways.\nMeaning if A then B,\nif I go down this street turn\nleft and go that way to work,\nit is fast.\nIf I go down the other street, it's slow.\nIf there's a traffic jam there,\nI'm going to go there\nbut it's starting to explore\ndifferent possibilities.\nAnd there are very, very\nfew opportunities in life\nto explore contingencies\nin this low stakes way,\nsuch that it engages neuroplasticity,\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nSo play is powerful\nat making your prefrontal\ncortex more plastic,\nmore able to change in\nresponse to experience,\nbut not just during the period of play,\nbut in all scenarios,\nbecause you get one prefrontal cortex,\nyou don't get a prefrontal\ncortex just for play.\nYou get a prefrontal cortex\nthat engages in everything.\nSo going forward,\nI will layer on some more\nconcrete aspects of tools,\nbut for now,\nif you're somebody that\ndoesn't consider yourself,\nparticularly playful\nconsider,\nand maybe even engage in\njust a little bit of play\nin some way,\nthat is of discomfort to you\nwith the understanding that is increasing\nyour prefrontal cortical plasticity.\nAnother really interesting\nand important aspect of play\nis so-called play postures.\nThese are seen in animals,\nand these are seen in humans.\nAnd for those of you that\nare watching this podcast\non YouTube, I'll do my\nbest to adopt them here.\nFor those of you that are listening,\nyou'll just have to imagine\nthem in your mind's eye,\nbut Jaak Panksepp and\nindeed Darwin himself,\nstudy these play postures\nthat all animal engage in.\nPerhaps the most familiar one\nis seen in dogs and in wolves\nwhere they will lower\ntheir head to the ground\nand they'll put their\npaws out in front of them\nand they will make eye contact\nwith another typically dog or wolf\nto so-called call the play.\nNow, when they do this posture,\nit's obvious that they're\nlowering themselves.\nThey're not in an aggressive stance,\nbecause they're lowering their head.\nAnd this is universally known\namong canines as play posture.\nThere's some famous videos online.\nYou can look these up\nof dogs actually doing this with bears\nthat they're confronted with\nand the bears, at least in these videos\nin exchange also lowering their head,\nand there you see bear\ndog playful interactions.\nNow you always have to be\ncautious with bears in general.\nI would say you have to\nbe cautious with bears,\nbut this speaks to the\nuniversality of this bowing,\nthis sort of the, the,\nwhat some people call the puppy bow\nor the play bow that dogs do\nturns out that humans do this as well.\nAlthough in a different form,\nI'm sure there are some that go into the,\nthe down-dog play posture,\nbut more typically when\nhumans want to play,\nthey will do a subtle or\nnot so subtle head tilt.\nThe head tilt with eyes open\nis considered the universal head\nand facial expression\nposture of play in humans.\nSo when two people see one another,\nif they are aggressive\ntowards one another,\nthey will assume certain facial\nexpressions and postures.\nBut if they're feeling\nplayful towards one another,\noftentimes they'll tip\ntheir head to the side\njust a little bit and\nthey'll open their eyes.\nThey might even raise\ntheir eyebrows briefly.\nThis has been seen again\nand again and again.\nAnother hardwired feature\nof so-called play postures\nis what's called soft eyes.\nWhen animals are aggressive,\nor when they're sad,\nthey tend to reduce the\nsize of their eye openings\nby basically making their\neyelids closer together,\nsomewhat,\nby keeping their eyes together\nin particular for aggression,\nthey'll bring their eyes towards\nwhat we call a vergence eye movement.\nBring it towards the center\nthat actually narrows the\naperture of the visual field.\nWhen people or animals\nwant to engage in play,\nthey tend to open their eyelids somewhat,\nand they tend to purse their\nlips just a little bit.\nSo it's not like stronger\npursing when your lips like this,\nit's, pursing their lips.\nThey'll open their eyes a little bit.\nAnd they'll often do\nthe head tilt as well.\nSometimes with a little bit of a smile.\nThese are reflexive\nthese are not trained up.\nChildren do this.\nAdults do this dogs, wolves do this.\nEven certain birds will do this.\nMost birds have eyes on\nthe side of their heads,\nbut they do a sort of form\nof this soft eyes approach.\nAnd certainly in raptors,\nyou see a softening of the eyes\nand indeed raptors like Hawks and Eagles\nthey actually do have\na certain form of play,\nbut only early in life.\nThe other thing that we see during play,\nor what are called partial postures,\npartial postures are a\nkind of play enactment\nof postures that would\notherwise be threatening.\nSo a partial posture that we\nsee during play in animals\nand humans that relates\nto aggressive play.\nSo things like wrestling\nor things like rough and tumble play,\nwhich is very common in animals\nand kids and some adults.\nIs that because there's going\nto be physical interaction\nin animals,\nwhat will happen is\nthey will march toward one\nanother often very slowly,\nbut rather than having their hair up,\nwhich is we call piloerection,\nwhich is when the hair goes up,\nanimals do this to make\nthemselves look bigger.\nThink of about the, the cat.\nThat's trying to look bigger or an animal\nthat's being aggressive,\ntrying to look bigger\nin the presence of a foe,\na different animal that\nthey're either going to try\nand kill or fight in some way,\neven if it's to defend themselves,\npartial postures occur\nwhen animals will approach\none another,\nbut they'll keep their fur down.\nHumans will do this to,\nthey will approach during play,\nbut unless it's highly competitive play\nlike a football game or a boxing match,\nthey will actually shrink\ntheir body size somewhat.\nWe have hair on our bodies,\nsome of us more than others,\nand that hair is capable of piloerection.\nIt can stand up.\nThat's the hair standing\nup on end phenomenon,\nbut most of us don't have\nenough hair on our bodies\nthat we can actually use that\nto make ourselves larger.\nSo what you see with people\nwho are about to engage in play\nis they tend to make their\nbody a little bit smaller\nunless they are highly competitive\nand highly competitive play\nis its own distinct form of play.\nThat we'll talk about later,\nsuch as during sport,\nwhen the stakes are high,\na Super Bowl football game,\nI'm revealing my ignorance\nabout sports here.\nThe Super Bowl as it's typically called\nis a very high stakes game, right?\nSalaries depend on it.\nSponsorships depend on it.\nIt's on television,\nreputations depend on it.\nSo that's not really playing a game.\nThat's playing a very high stakes game\nand there you're not going to\nsee these partial postures.\nYou're not going to see soft\neyes and tilting of the head.\nAt least not between the\nopposing players on the team,\nyou're going to see quite the opposite.\nGrunting, screaming, shouldering\npeople not blinking lowering their eyes,\nor rather shrinking their eyes down to be,\nto appear more aggressive.\nThese kinds of things\nstaring right through the other person,\nyou know verbal threats et cetera.\nSo that's not really play,\neven though we say they're\nplaying a game of football,\nit's very high stakes play.\nWhat I'm referring to here\nis when it's fairly low stakes.\nAnd we see this again\nin animals and human.\nSo there are many, many\nof these partial postures.\nAgain, they happen spontaneously.\nSo if someone ever looks at you\nand they tilt their head a little bit\nand they raise their eyebrows\nand they maybe smile a little bit,\nthey're looking at you playfully,\nthat's the universal human\nexchange of, I want to play.\nDo you want to play?\nThere's another play expression\nthat is considered the\nmost extreme of the come on\nlet's play express and postures.\nAnd this is one that's\nseen in a lot of primates\nand indeed in some humans as well.\nAnd that's the eyes wide open\nand believe it or not tongue out,\nit's the, that kind of silly thing.\nThat's I don't think that\nI've ever done that before.\nJust that kind of thing\nis basically what primate\nspecies of all kinds.\nAnd indeed we are old\nworld primates as well,\ndo when they want to say,\nI'm definitely here to play\nand that's why I'm here.\nOkay it's it has this kind\nof silly look or connotation.\nBut if you watch chimpanzees\nor you look at Bonobos,\nor even in the so-called\nnew world monkeys,\nwhich tend to be the smaller monkeys,\nold world monkeys tend to\nbe the ones that in general,\nsee the world as we do,\nthey have what we call trichromacy.\nThey're the ones that often\ncan look very human-like.\nThe new world monkeys\ntend to be the little ones\nin general I'll give\nyou a little trick here.\nLittle tool based on primatology.\nIf you see a monkey and it's\nmaking very slow movements,\nor you see an ape of any kinds,\nmaking very slow movements,\nvery likely to be an old world primate.\nIf you see a monkey\nand it's, it can very quick movements\nlike it's doing this kind of thing,\nlike it's like a could\nbe a squirrel monkey\ncould be a marmoset,\nlikely to be a new world monkey.\nAnd they don't see the world\nthat the same way we do,\nthey see the world more like a dog.\nThey don't really see reds.\nThey see reds as orange et cetera.\nOkay that's not a hard and fast rule.\nAnd I'm sure the primatologists\nare going to come after me\nwith whatever primatologists\ncome after you\nwith monkey biscuits\nor something like that.\nBut in general, it's a good rule.\nIf you're at the zoo and\nyou see a slow moving monkey\nwith slow deliberate gestures\nkind of moves its eyes\nmakes eye contact every once in a while,\nthose tend to be the old world primates,\nthose kind of jittery ones\nthat look like they're really\nnervous wrapping their tail\nand kind of hiding there\nin a little bundle.\nThose tend to be the\nnew world monkeys, okay.\nAgain, not a black and\nwhite type division,\nbut that'll get you most of the way.\nSo the whole purpose of\nthese partial postures\nor the tongue out thing\nis to limit power in deliberate ways\nto really take bodily expressions\nthat could be portrayed or could be\ninterpreted as aggressive\nor as threatening or as wanting to mate,\nor as willing wanting to do\nanything for that matter.\nAnd to limit the power with\nwhich they are expressed\nin very deliberate way.\nSo that's the putting the hair down,\ndespite getting into a fighting stance.\nThat's saying let's fight,\nbut I'm not really here to fight fight.\nIt's low stakes fighting.\nLike if I pin you,\nthen I'll let you go.\nOr if you pin me, then\nyou ought let me go.\nAnd so immediately you can start to see\nhow play starts to call into action,\nsocial dynamics in which both parties\nhave to make some sort of agreement\nabout how high the stakes are.\nNow, the failures to do this\nare also very informative\nin how we develop in social groups.\nAnd this also can inform why some people\nreally play well with others\nand other people don't.\nAnd some people seem to\nget along well with groups\nand can handle other people.\nAnd some people are very rigid.\nIn fact, I have an anecdote\nabout this when I was a kid,\nwe used to play this game.\nIt's not a game I suggest,\nbut we used to do what were\ncalled \"Dirt Clod Wars.\"\nSo a friend of mine,\nhis parents were generally\nnot home in the afternoon.\nSo we must have been somewhere\naround 10 or 11 years old.\nAnd we would set up these\ntwo big dirt mounds.\nWe would shovel them to big\ndirt mounds on two sides\nof the yard.\nAnd then we would just take dirt clods\nand we throw them at one\nanother and just have\ndirt clod wars.\nAgain, not suggesting this\nI'm not responsible for what happens\nif you do,\nbut there were rules\nand the rules were, for instance,\nyou couldn't pack rocks\ninto the dirt clods\nand you could run across to the other side\nand you could jump on\nthe other person's mound\nand you could throw dirt clods in there.\nI guess, as the stuff that\nwe thought was entertaining.\nBut if someone got hit in the head,\ngenerally there was an unspoken rule\nthat you kind of stop\nand see whether or not they were damaged\nor not before you'd continue,\nyou couldn't continue pelting them.\nAnd of course, people broke this rule.\nIn fact I remember one kid\nI'm not going to name him\nbecause actually he's grown\ninto a very actually prominent\nand functional adult,\nbut he got hit once in the head.\nAnd then I think someone\nhad thrown a dirt clod\nshortly thereafter,\nand all of a sudden he\njust went into a rage,\npicking up rocks and sticks\nand attacking another kid.\nAnd so clearly that was a case in which\nthe rules of the game\nwere now being violated,\nbut it served a very important purpose.\nThere was, you know,\nthe typical thing that the,\nthere were some tears I think,\nas I recall from one kid or the other,\nthere was like snot coming out of the nose\nand turning bright red, a kid went home.\nIt was a mess.\nThe parents had to say something,\nor maybe there was a phone call.\nI don't quite recall how it got resolved.\nBut the idea is that\nthere's an agreed upon set of rules\nabout how high the stakes are\nand what we're all going to do.\nAnd this is separate from sport\nwhere there are clearly defined rules\nabout what's out of bounds.\nWhat's in-bounds.\nWhat sorts of behaviors\nwill get you a yellow card\nor a red card for instance\non the soccer field,\nall animals including humans\nare doing this low stakes\ncontingency testing\nand all animals including\nhumans you'll find,\nstart to up the stakes.\nAnd inevitably in group play,\none member of the group\nwill kind of break rules.\nYou see this also in puppies.\nSo for instance, puppies\nwill bite one another\nwith those sharp little\nneedle-like puppy teeth.\nI remember when Costello had those teeth,\nthose things were so darn sharp\nand puppies will yelp\nwhen one of their littermates bites them,\nthat Yelp actually serves a very important\ninhibitory function.\nThis is well defined\nto tell the other one that's too tough,\nand this is how animals learn soft bite.\nOkay.\nIf they don't get that feedback\nfrom other littermates,\nthey never actually learn.\nWhat's too hard and what's soft.\nAnd so humans do this as well.\nNow you can look at your adult,\ncounterparts,\nand indeed we should probably\nlook at ourselves and ask,\nyou know did we learn\nproper play contingency\nwhen we were younger?\nDo we tend to take things too seriously?\nDo we tend to overreact aggressively\nwhen other people are clearly engaging in,\nyou know, playful, jabbing or sarcasm\nor things of that sort.\nSo each of you will have a\ndifferent experience of this,\nbut the point is that play\nserves many functions,\nit's not just about the self.\nIt's also about interactions\nbetween multiple people.\nIt's about rule testing\nand low stakes contingency\nrule breaking also\nserves an important role\nas is with the example\nof the \"Dirt Clod War\"\npuppies biting other puppies et cetera.\nAnd last but not least,\nthere are different forms of play\nthat help us establish who\nwe will become as adults.\nOne of the more powerful of these\nis role play when children\nand sometimes adults\nwill take on different\nroles that are distinct\nfrom their natural world roles\nin order to for instance,\nestablish hierarchies.\nSo someone's going to be the leader\nand someone's going to be the follower.\nSomeone will be dominant.\nSomeone will be submissive.\nSomeone will work alone.\nOther people will work in a group.\nThese kinds of role playing\nare again ways in which\nthe prefrontal cortex\nhas to expand the number of operations\nin neuroscience we call these algorithms\nthat it has to run in\norder to make predictions.\nYou have to take in a lot of information\nabout your environment all the time\nand make predictions.\nBut if you are suddenly\ncast into a new role,\nwell then you definitely have to\nmake even more predictions\nfrom a different standpoint.\nSo these are very powerful\nfor teaching the brain,\nhow to function.\nI had a sister growing\nup, I still have a sister,\nfortunately,\nand she and her friends\nlargely played with dolls\nand doll houses in the room next door.\nAnd they take on different roles.\nIn fact, some kids,\nif they play alone\nwill start to take on the role of leader\nby taking on an imaginary or\ncreating an imaginary friend.\nAnd, you know, my apologies to my sibling,\nbut for a long time,\nshe had an imaginary friend\neventually that imaginary\nfriend disappeared.\nI don't know the science\naround imaginary friends\nand what it makes them disappear or not\nat what stage of development,\nbut imaginary friends are pretty common.\nAnd that's just another\nway of being able to,\nyou know boss somebody around,\nif that's your thing,\nor to do engage in cooperative play.\nSo we can look at this\nstage of development,\nwe call childhood\nand we can look at each stage\nof it and we can say, wow,\nthere are all these\ndifferent dimensions of play\nthat really are about testing out\nhow we feel comfortable or uncomfortable,\nhow we react good or bad,\nhow we react with stress or with glee\nwhen others behave in certain ways.\nAnd so what I'm hoping is coming through\nis that play is not just about having fun.\nPlay is about testing.\nIt's about experimenting\nand it's about expanding\nyour brain's capacity.\nAnd that's through early in development,\nand it's through throughout the lifespan.\nSo at this point in the discussion,\nI want to take a step back,\nlook at the biology and\nneurochemistry of play\njust a little bit.\nAnd that really define\nwhat is effective play.\nIf the goal of play is to\nexplore different contingencies\nin low stakes environments\nand to expand the function\nof our prefrontal cortex\nso that we can see new possibilities\nand new ways of being become\nmore flexible, more creative,\nmore effective outside\nof the games of play\nor the arenas of play, I should say.\nWell then we should be asking,\nhow do I know if I'm playing?\nHow do I know if I'm playing correctly?\nTurns out there's an answer to that.\nEarlier I referred to this brain area,\nthe periaqueductal gray\nthat releases opioids,\nendogenous opioids into\nour brain and body,\nand tends to relax us a bit.\nIt actually is what leads to\nthese things like soft eyes\nand head tilts and\npuppies making, you know,\npuppy postures and things of that sort,\nand how that opens up the\nnumber of different functions\nor algorithms that the\nprefrontal cortex can run,\nbut there's another piece of the puzzle,\nwhich is for something to\ngenuinely be play and playful,\nand for it to have this\neffect of expanding our brain\nand engaging neuroplasticity\nof really changing our brain\nso that we can see and engaging\nmore possible behaviors\nand thoughts et cetera.\nWe also have to have low\namounts of adrenaline,\nso called epinephrine\nin our brain in body.\nNow the background science\nfor this is quite extensive,\nbut for those of you that\nare interested in papers\nand manuscripts,\nperhaps the best one is a review published\nin Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews\nby the very Jaak Panksepp\nalthough he has a co-author,\nwhich is Stephen Siviy,\nS I V I Y\nI'll provide a link to this\nin the caption show notes.\nAnd the title of this paper is;\n\"In Search of the\nNeurobiological Substrates for\nSocial Playfulness in Mammalian Brains.\"\nAnd it's a quite extensive review,\nbut it basically boils down\nto some key findings\nwhereby, any sorts of drugs\nor behaviors or scenarios\nthat increase levels\nof adrenaline too much,\nwill tend to inhibit play\nand drugs and scenarios\nand I'm not suggesting\nrecreational drugs here,\nbut these were experiments that were done\nin the laboratory setting\nthat increase the endogenous opioid output\nwill tend to increase playfulness.\nAnd so really the state of mind\nthat one needs to adopt when playing is,\nfirst of all you have to\nengage in the play it,\nwhatever it happens to be\nwith some degree of focus\nand seriousness\nand focus and seriousness in\nthe neurobiological context\ngenerally means epinephrine\nbeing able to focus is largely reliant on\nthings like adrenaline epinephrine,\nbut also the presence of dopamine,\nwhich is a molecule that\ngenerates motivation\nand focus in concert with epinephrine,\nbut also that these endogenous\nopioids be liberated.\nAnd it's really the low\nstakes feature of play\nthat allows those endogenous\nopioids to be liberated.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if you are very, very\nconcerned about the outcome,\nlike you've put a lot of money\non the table in a given game,\nor you're a football\nplayer in the Super Bowl,\nor you're playing a game for which,\nyou know, defeating the other person\nor your team winning is\nabsolutely crucial to you.\nWell then that's not\nreally going to who engage\nthe play circuitry.\nOn the contrary,\nif you are engaging in\nthose same behaviors\nor any other behavior in a way\nthat you're simply there to explore,\nbut you don't have high levels\nof adrenaline in your system,\nyou're not stressed about\nthe potential outcome.\nWell, then that constitutes play.\nNow that's somewhat\nobvious on the one hand\nthat you take seriously\nwhat you take seriously,\nand you can be more playful about things\nthat you don't take so seriously,\nbut what is absolutely not obvious\nis that the state of playfulness\nis actually what allows\nyou to perform best\nbecause the state of playfulness\noffers you the opportunity to engage\nin novel types of\nbehaviors and interactions\nthat you would not\notherwise be able to access\nif you are so focused\non the outcome. Okay.\nSo a state of playfulness\nis absolutely critical,\nnot just during play,\nbut during competitive\nscenarios of any kind.\nI actually started to cultivate\na practice related to this.\nWhen I was in college,\nI had this kind of general practice\nof when I wanted to learn something.\nI would tell myself that\nit was the most important\ninformation in the world\nand that I was very very interested in it.\nI would kind of lie to myself\nand say oh, I'm super interested in,\nI won't name the topics,\nbut super interested in this\nor super interested in that.\nAnd I could sort of delude\nmyself into being hyper focused\non whatever it is\nthat I was learning\nin ways that surprised me.\nHowever,\nwhen we are hyper focused on something\nand we are rigidly\nattached to the outcome,\nwe can't engage in flexible thinking.\nSo it's a great tool to be\nhyper-focused on something\nand take it very, very seriously\nwhen we're simply trying to learn things\nby kind of rote memory,\nlearn things and regurgitate,\nlearn and regurgitate of the sort that,\nyou know, I'm frankly a\nlot of schooling involves.\nBut if we are trying to\nget better at something,\nwe sort of hit a wall\nin athletic performance\nor in cognitive performance,\nwhere we're not creative enough,\nwhere we're finding\nlet's just use a sports example\nthat, you know we only have\na certain number of moves\nthat we can deploy\nor certain number of swings of the racket\nthat we can deploy.\nThe way to actually expand your practice\nis to engage in this kind\nof low stakes thinking,\nthe idea that, well, I'm just\ngoing to kind of play and tinker.\nI'm going to explore in a way\nthat it doesn't really matter\nif the ball goes back over\nthe net,\ndoesn't really matter if\nthe ball goes in the hole\nand it's counterintuitive\nbecause you think,\nno, the thing that we need\nto do is drill and drill\nand drill and drill.\nAnd indeed there's a place for that.\nBut this mode of play with modest levels\nof endogenous opioids being\nreleased in our system,\nplus low levels of adrenaline, right?\nEpinephrine low levels of\nepinephrine and adrenaline\nare possible only when\nthe stakes are low enough\nthat we're not stressed.\nWell that combination really\nallows the prefrontal cortex\nto explore different possibilities\nin ways that can truly expand\nour capabilities over time.\nNow, this has been seen again and again,\nalso in the business sector,\nsome of the more challenging,\nor I should say compare additive\ncompanies to get jobs at\nare very interested in hiring people\nthat as children were so called tinkerers,\nand actually NASA was\nfirst famous for this,\nthat many of the people\nthat achieved great success\nin engineering at NASA,\nwhen they looked back into\ntheir childhood histories,\nthose people tended to be tinkerers.\nThey were people that would\nkind of play with things\nin way that wasn't about\nrigidly following a recipe\nor an instruction manual.\nGreat cooks discover new forms of food.\nIndeed created entire genres of food\nby way of being tinkerers.\nOkay, musicians do this.\nI grew up playing various sports,\nbut skateboarding was one that\nI was particularly involved\nin for a long time.\nOne of the greatest\nskateboarders of all time\nis some of you may recognize his name\nas the Great Rodney Mullen.\nAnd Rodney was kind of\nfamous for evolving the sport\nand continuing to evolve the sport in ways\nthat no one could predict\nusing skateboards and all sorts of ways\nthat no one had thought of previously.\nAnd of course there\nare other skateboarders\nthat did that as well,\nbut he's particularly well known for that.\nAnd his process is his own.\nI can't speak to it too much,\nbut he was also known\nas a kind of a tinker\nas somebody who would spend a lot of time,\njust kind of flipping the board\nand just flipping it into the air\nand watching the ways in which it flipped\nand kind of studying\nthe physics of it really\nand expanding on his\nexisting understanding\nof what could happen on a skateboard\nby way of just playing.\nNow, he took it very seriously,\nbut it's this kind of razor's edge\nbetween taking something very seriously,\nbut also tinkering and\nplaying and exploring\nand just seeing what\nhappens and kind of like,\nwell, let's just see what\nhappens if we did this,\nthat mindset is extremely powerful\nto export from this\nthing that we call play\ninto what we could call\nmore serious endeavor\nof one's occupation or sport,\nwhether or not it's behind a desk\nor whether or not it's\nrunning around on a field\nreally for or engineering, any endeavor.\nAnd so the whole purpose\nof this episode on play\nis yes on the one hand\nto illustrate the incredible\nevolutionary utility of play\nfor setting up the self\nand relation of the self to others,\nindeed for setting up cultures entirely,\ncuz' cultures will watch sport together\nor they'll celebrate their team winning.\nI mean, World Cup,\nI've never been a big soccer fan,\neven though my dad is\nArgentine, but it's incredible.\nI mean the entire world kind of lights up\nand gets engaged around\nwhether or not their team,\ntheir country is going\nto win the Olympics also\nbeing another example,\nbut play and sport are not quite the same\nas I've pointed out before.\nAnd for all of us who\nare thinking about tools\nand things that we can\nextract from science\nto enrich our lives,\nI would say for those of\nyou that are already playing\non a regular basis\nin one form or another\nterrific start to expand\nother forms of play\nin particular forms of play\nthat involve new groups of individuals.\nSo if you're somebody that typically plays\none-on-one with somebody,\ntry to expand into playing as teams.\nIf you're somebody who only plays alone,\nthen try to expand into playing in perhaps\none-on-one first and in groups,\nthis is the way that your brain learns\nand evolves and changes and gets better.\nAnd I raised this because\nanother one of the top 10 questions I get\nis how can I keep my brain young?\nHow can I continue to learn?\nHow can I get better in school\nand sport in life and\nrelationships, et cetera,\nemotionally, cognitively,\nand on and on and on.\nAnd yes,\nthere are supplements that\ncan support neuroplasticity.\nYes, there are brain games and apps\nthat can support neuroplasticity.\nBut if you really want to engage\nneuroplasticity at any age,\nwhat you need to do is\nreturn to the same sorts\nof practices and tools\nthat your nervous system naturally used\nthroughout development.\nAnd it evolved over hundreds\nof thousands of years\nto trigger this thing that\nwe call neuroplasticity.\nAnd the reason this is\nso important is because\nit starts to move us away from\nwhat some people call hacks.\nI define hacks as using one\nthing for a different purpose\nto kind of get a shortcut.\nI don't really like the term, frankly,\nand I don't like it\nbecause it's not grounded\nin any biological mechanism.\nBut when we look at play,\nwe can say, play is the portal to plastic.\nPlay at every stage of life\nis the way in which we learned the rules\nfor that stage of life.\nAnd play is the way in\nwhich we were able to test\nhow we might function in\nthe real world context.\nSo play is powerful.\nAnd we could even say that play\nis the most powerful portal\nto plasticity.\nThe reason for that is that\nyes, this high opioid, low\nepinephrine or adrenaline state\nis what opens up play.\nBut then inside of the arena of play,\nwhen the prefrontal cortex is running\nall these different possibilities\nin this low stakes way.\nBut with some degree of focus,\nthere are a number of other\nchemicals that are deployed.\nThings like Brain-derived\nneurotrophic factor\nand other growth factors that actually\ntrigger the rewiring of brain circuits\nthat allow for it to expand.\nAnd indeed that's what is neuroplasticity.\nIf you're interested in those chemicals\nand kind of arena of things that happen\nwhen one engages in neuroplasticity,\nthere's a vast literature out there.\nBut one of the more popular books\nthat I think is quite good\nis from my friend and\ncolleague, John Ratey,\nwho's a psychiatrist at\nHarvard Medical School.\nThat's R A T E Y.\nHe wrote the book \"Spark\"\na few years back,\nand I think it's still very relevant.\nAnd John talks about\nthe important role that play\nexerts in the neuroplasticity process\nand points to a number\nof different protocols\nthat one can engage in.\nHe also points to the\nimportance of navigating\nnew environments\nto not just go on the\nsame hike every week,\nor take the same walk,\nbut actually get into\nnew novel environments.\nSo you're starting to sense a theme here.\nThere's novelty,\nexploring contingencies,\nkeeping the stakes relatively low,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut these really are the gates\nto this holy grail that\nwe call neuroplasticity.\nNeuroplasticity as I've talked\nabout in the podcast before\nis a two step process.\nIt involves focusing very intensely\nor at least focusing\nsomewhat on whatever it is\nthat one is trying to learn,\nand then engaging in deep rest,\nideally deep sleep in\nthe following nights.\nAnd I've also talked about\nthe benefits of things\nlike naps and Yoga Nidra so-called NSDR,\nNon Sleep Deep Rest\nfor enhancing or accelerating plasticity.\nYou can check out the episodes\non Focus at hubermanlab.com\nor the episodes on How to Learn Faster.\nThe detail all of those.\nWe had a newsletter that lists out\nall the tools for neuroplasticity\nenhancing neuroplasticity,\nall that is available.\nZero cost to you at\nhubermalab.com, et cetera.\nYou can just download that information,\nbut John's book that\nnewsletter those episodes.\nThey really point to this two step process\nwhere it's focus and then rest\nfocus and then rest\nand play is its own unique form\nof focus and then rest, focus and rest.\nIt's not the same as learning\nsomething for sake of school\nor critically trying to\nlearn a motor behavior\nfor sake of sport.\nIt's really about expanding\nthe number of things\nthat you could learn down the line.\nOkay, so said once again.\nSo I just want to make\nsure it's abundantly clear\nplay is about establishing\na broader framework\nwithin which you can learn new things.\nIt's not about learning\nsome specific thing.\nIt's not about the game\nyou happen to be playing.\nIt's not about the dollhouse\nthat the kids are playing with\nso that they can become\namazing dollhouse players\nwhen they grow up. Right.\nThe dirt Clod war that\nI referred to earlier\nfor better or for worse\nwas not about becoming\nthe best dirt clod thrower\nor winning the trophy for dirt clods\nin the neighborhood.\nAlthough we actually had a trophy\nfor the best dirt clod team.\nAlas, it was not my team that year.\nBut the point is that\nyou're learning rules\nand establishing a broader\nfoundation of practices\nthat then can learn more\nthings within that context.\nThus far I've tried to convince you\nthrough a combination of data\nand anecdote and explanation\nthat adopting a stance of playfulness\nand indeed engaging in play\non a somewhat regular basis\ncould be beneficial to you\nregardless of circumstances or goals.\nIf I haven't done that already,\nwhat I'm about to tell you,\nhopefully will push you over the line.\nIt turns out that when you\nlook across the kingdom\nof all animals,\nwhat you find is that animals\nthat engage in playful behaviors\nfor the longest period of time\nare also the animals that\nhave the greatest degree\nof neuroplasticity,\nthe brain and nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience,\nput differently,\nanimals that only play\nfor a very small fraction\nof their entire life\nhave very rigid brains that\ndon't learn new things,\nwhereas animals that\nplay for a long period\nthroughout their life\nhave very plastic brains.\nAnd there's even some\nevidence that's at this point,\nlargely anecdotal,\nbut there's some data starting to emerge\nthat adults that maintain a playful stance\nthat engage in things again\nthat are low stakes contingency exploring\nimportant enough that people focus\nand that people pay attention\nto what they're doing,\nbut that they are not, you know,\nfilled with adrenaline, you know,\nfreaked out about the\noutcome being A or B,\nthey're not super, super competitive,\nmaybe just a little bit competitive\nor not competitive at all.\nThat allows for more ongoing plasticity.\nAnd one of the people that comes to mind\nin thinking about this is\nof course the Physicist,\nand I should say the Great\nPhysicist, Richard Feynman,\nNobel Prize Winner Professor at Caltech\nwas involved in the Manhattan Project,\nbut was also known for being\na lifelong tinker, right?\nHe also is a mischievous tinker.\nIf you read any of the books\nabout Feynman or by Feynman\n\"Surely You're Joking.\"\nMr. Feynman, or \"What Do You\nCare What Other People Think?\"\nthese are wonderful short stories,\nmostly about Feynman,\ndoing things like\npicking all the locks at\nthe Los Alamos Laboratory\nand putting all the top secret documents\nout on the floor of the office\nso that when people\ncame men in the morning,\nthey were all out there.\nObviously they weren't\nreleased to the general public.\nHe didn't want to threaten\nnational security,\nbut playing pranks like that.\nAnd actually Caltech,\nI don't know if this is still the case,\nbut Caltech where he was employed\nwas always known for doing very\ntechnologically challenging pranks.\nThey're not known for their\nathletic pros at Caltech,\nsorry, Caltech,\nbut they were known for example,\ndisrupting the scoreboard at\nthe Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\nfor instance,\nand things of that sort\nthrough technological\nfeats, at least at the time\nrequired a lot of playfulness\nand technological pros.\nSo if you look in science\nor you look in art,\nor you look in medicine\nor you in any domain,\nwhat you find is the people\nthat continue to evolve\nnew practices\ntend to be people that were tinkerers.\nPeople that are very creative,\ntend to be people that are unafraid\nof exploring things in\na, this low stakes way.\nThey're not so rigidly\nattached to the outcome\nthat they have to do everything\nperfectly all the time.\nNow they might cloak\nthese playful behaviors\nso that their final works\nalways look perfect or\nalways look incredible,\nbut they have this kind of\nplayful nature about them.\nI would venture even say that the,\nthe street artist Banksy, for instance,\nobviously an incredible\nartist puts a ton of thought\nand preparation into their work,\nbut there's a kind of playfulness\nto the whole thing too,\nof using two dimensional paintings\nin concert with three\ndimensional city dwellings\nin ways that,\nyou know I think that most\npeople hadn't previously,\nthere were other people\nlike Christo and, you know,\nartists of that sort that did that.\nBut I think Banksy is kind of recognized\nas the modern, the modern rendition\nof that kind of playfulness\nusing cities in ways\nthat most people don't use cities\nusing art in ways that\nmost people don't use art,\nfor instance.\nSo to go back to the example of Feynman.\nFeynman was somebody who learned to paint\nand draw quite well into his sixties.\nHe was somewhat famous or infamous,\nI should say for Bongo Drumming\non the roof of Caltech.\nI say infamous because\nhe was known also for doing that naked.\nSomething that certainly not in concert\nwith the ethical standards and behaviors\nof universities today.\nBut Feynman had this\nplayful spirit as a child.\nHe had that playful spirit as a teenager,\nand he had that playful\nspirit as an adult.\nAnd that's one of the\nwhole hallmarks of Feynman\nwas that he wasn't just a rigid physicist\nwho could explain things\nclearly to the general public.\nHe always carried through\nthis playful spirit\nand in some of his writings,\nhe pointed to the fact\nthat that playful spirit\nwas something that he worked very hard\nto continue to cultivate in himself\nbecause it was the way\nin which he could see\nthe world differently\nand to indeed make great discoveries\nin the field of physics,\nbut also to kind of\nevolve his relationship\nto life more generally.\nAnd so he comes to mind\nas a prominent example\nof somebody who did this.\nAnd if I could achieve\nanything with this episode,\nbesides teaching you something\nabout the biology of play,\nit would be to teach you\nabout the utility of play.\nAgain, I'm,\ndon't consider myself a\nparticularly playful person\nby nature,\nbut I've tried over the years to adopt\nthis stance of exploring\nthings that are, you know,\nvery focused on contingencies\nof different kinds,\nbut keep the stakes low enough\nthat I can have some fun doing them.\nAnd I like to think that\nit's benefited me somewhat.\nNow, I'd like to drill\na little bit further\ninto this thing that we\ncalled neuroplasticity.\nAgain neuroplasticity is the\nbrain and nervous system's\nability to change in\nresponse to experience.\nAnd I should just say that\nthroughout the entire lifespan,\nthe nervous system can change very quickly\nin response to negative experiences.\nWe can almost all engage in\nwhat's called one trial learning\nwhere if something really\nterrible or traumatic happens\nto us,\nour nervous system will\nrewire almost immediately,\nat least within a few days,\nsuch that we tend to want\nto avoid the experience\nthat led to that trauma.\nNow the whole business of\nwhy people return to things\nthat are traumatic to them\nis a whole other issue.\nThere are books about\nthings like trauma bonding.\nThere's the so-called\nrepetition compulsion\nfrom psychoanalysis\nthat people go back into trauma to retest\nand gain new opportunities\nto overcome the trauma,\net cetera, et cetera.\nBut in general, what I'm\nreferring to here is,\nyou know,\nyou have a bad experience\nat the swimming pool\nwhen you're a kid\nwhere someone holds your\nhead underwater too long,\nand then you just don't want\nto get back in the water.\nThat's one trial learning of sorts,\nthat of course can be overcomed\nthrough proper exposure therapy\nor someone that you\ntrust taking you there,\nor any number of behaviors\nthat allow you to overcome that,\nbe that particular scenario\nand experience something new\nin that same context.\nBut across the lifespan,\nthe learn earning of new\nthings, new contingencies,\nnew possibilities\noccurs very differently\nfrom about age zero when we're born\nuntil about age 25 and thereafter.\nSo from about, about,\nI want to emphasize\napproximately age 25 onward\nneuroplasticity occurs through the process\nthat is exactly as I\ndescribed before, focus, rest,\nfocus, rest, we focus very intensely.\nWe can't do the thing.\nWe can't do the new movement.\nWe can't do the golf swing.\nWe can't learn the math.\nWe try, we try, we try, we\ntry, we sleep a few nights.\nAnd then all of a sudden\nwe can do it, right,\nbecause the rewiring actually\noccurs during deep rest\nor naps,\nbut mostly during deep sleep.\nFrom birth till about out age 25 however,\nwe can learn things, new things,\nand new contingencies,\nnot just negative things\nand traumatic things\nthrough somewhat passive\nexposure to those things, right.\nI will never forget the first time\nthat we went on a family\ntrip to Washington DC.\nAnd we went to the Smithsonian.\nI got to see the, the old fighter planes.\nAnd I think,\nI think the Kitty Hawk\nor the first one of the\nfirst planes was there.\nAnyway, I obviously my\nrecollection isn't terrific.\nMy hippocampus is, is\nflailing on that one,\nbut I'll never forget the trip.\nAnd I'll never forget who went.\nAnd I think I was probably\neight or nine years old.\nIt's embedded somewhere in my memory.\nAnd so just through passive experience\nand my focusing on the\nthings that excited me\nabout that trip,\nI have a recollection of that experience.\nI didn't have to deliberately focus.\nI didn't, wasn't telling myself focused,\nyou're going to need to\nremember this trip someday\nand you're going to be\npodcasting about this,\nyou know, in 39 years, or whenever\nagain, I forget exactly how old I was.\nBut the key feature here is that\nthe developing brain is able\nto learn through passive experience\nbecause the neurons, the nerve\ncells in the developing brain\nare much more over-connected\nthan they will be later in life.\nThe way to think about this is sort of,\nif you use Google maps,\nas I do too often I think\nwhen I drive,\nthere are a number of roads and pathways\nthat would get you from\npoint A to point B.\nWe could imagine those as neural circuits,\nor we could imagine neural\ncircuits as those roads.\nEarly in development,\nthe nerve connections\nare much more extensive.\nIt it's like having a Google maps\nthat where everything is\nconnected to everything\nthrough tiny little cross streets.\nAnd the whole thing is\njust a complete mess.\nBut then by taking particular routes\nof behavior of thought of emotion,\ncertain routes become well established.\nAnd the other routes that are not taken\nsimply disappear.\nNow in the biological\ncontext in the brain,\nwe call that process pruning.\nAnd the simple way to envision\nthis is early in development.\nYou have many, many more\nneurons than you will have\nas an adult.\nThose neurons are\nextensively interconnected,\nand approximately 40% of\nthose interconnections\nwill disappear by the\ntime you're 25 years old,\nthey are gone.\nThey are actively\nremoved through processes\nthat involve things like\nglial cells that come in\nand literally sneak their little processes\nin between neurons at the synapse,\nwhich are the points of\ncontact and communication\nbetween neurons and push those apart,\neven eat neurons, right?\nThere's some incredible\nwork from for instance,\nBeth Stevens' Lab at\nHarvard Medical School,\nshowing that glial cells\ngo in and eat synapses\nthat are not functional for\nthat particular circuit.\nNow, what this tells us is\nthat much of our learning\nduring development is the\nremoval of incorrect connections,\nbut it also involves the\nstrengthening of connections\nthat are going to serve certain\nemotions, certain functions,\nmotor functions, cognitive\nfunctions, et cetera.\nThe process of play\nis largely a process of engaging pruning\nof neural connections\nand strengthening of the\nremaining connections.\nI'm sure that many of\nyou have heard the term\nfire together wire together.\nThat phrase is often\nincorrectly attributed\nto the great Donald Hebb,\nwho indeed was great.\nDid incredible work a\npsychologist from Canada\nwho established a lot of the\nbasic cellar learning rules\nfor learning and memory,\nbut it was the also great Dr. Carla Shatz,\nwho is now at Stanford\nand was at Berkeley and Harvard as well,\nbut who is at Stanford Medical School\nwho coined this term fire\ntogether wire together.\nIndeed that's what happens\nwhen children play\nwhen adolescents play\nand when young adults play,\nwhether or not it's social play\nor play with an object,\nwhether or not it's a\nsport or a play of any kind\nimaginary play imaginary friend play,\nthere is a strengthening of\ncertain neural connections\nand a pruning away of up to 40%,\nperhaps even more of connections\nthat are not necessary for\ncertain types of behaviors,\nemotions, and thoughts.\nAnd what this means is\nthat it is through the process of play,\nthat we become who we are as adults.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nit is through the process of play\nthat we are able to adjust\nwho we are as adults.\nNow, there are bounds on this process,\nas far as I know there's\nnever been a reported case\nof an individual who had a hyperplastic\nor I should say a brain that\nwas as plastic in adulthood\nas it was in childhood.\nBut what this tells us is that\nwhat we do in the process\nof play as children\nis really how we set up the rules\nfor how we behave as adults\nin almost all domains,\nwhich is really incredible.\nAnd of course the reassuring thing is that\nplaying as an adult\nwill allow you to expand\non those neural circuits.\nYou can literally grow new connections.\nSome of you may be saying,\ndoes it create new neurons\nfor better or for worse?\nIt does not seem that\nmany new neurons are added\nto your brain in adulthood.\nThere are some papers\nthat report a few neurons\nin certain brain areas,\nisolated brain areas,\nbut by and large,\nmost of the rewiring of neural connections\nis the removal of certain connections.\nThis process we're calling Pruning\nand the strengthening of\nthe remaining connections\nthat make those kind of Google maps roads.\nAnd the analogy I laid out before\nthicker and more robust think about as\ntaking little trails\nand turning them into roads,\nthen paving those roads.\nThen turning those roads into highways,\nthen putting up more\nlanes on those highways\nand eliminating all the small\nlittle back-country roads\nthat one could take.\nAnd again,\nthis is an analogy for what is happening\nat the level of neuro circuitry.\nNow,\none of the key findings that\nhas emerged from the literature\nis children that have\nbeen subjected to trauma\nor immense amounts of stress of any kind,\nhave a harder time both engaging in play,\nbut also a harder time\naccessing neuroplasticity later\nin life.\nThe good news is this is\nnot a permanent effect.\nAnd we'll talk about some\nof the ways to overcome that\nin a moment,\nbut this should make sense to you\nbecause earlier we talked about\nhow a high level of adrenaline\nepinephrine in the brain and body\nactually inhibits blocks the circuits\nin the brain and body that\ngenerate play behavior.\nAnd when I say that,\nI mean that in a very concrete way,\nthat epinephrine and adrenaline\ncan actually suppress\nthe sorts of circuitry\nthat can lead to things like soft eyes\nor tongue out, or the head tilt,\nor what we called partial postures\nof being able to engage in,\nyou know, a rough and tumble play,\nbut not take that to the\npoint of outright aggression\nand damaging the other\nperson or them damaging you.\nSo when I say that,\nyou know, trauma and stress\ncan inhibit neuroplasticity\nby way of inhibiting play\nat a deeper neuro biological level.\nWhat I'm really saying is\nthat the high levels of adrenaline\nthat are generated from\ntrauma and stress actually\nshut down the circuits\nthat allow a child or a young adult\nto enter the game of play\nor in the game of play\nin the same way that\na child or young adult\nwho didn't have high levels of adrenaline\nin their system could possibly engage in.\nNow,\nthe good news is that many of\nthe existing trauma therapies\nthat are out there now,\nincluding things like EMDR\nExposure Therapy, Cognitive\nBehavioral therapy,\nand on and on,\nincluding some of the therapies\nthat are more neurochemical,\nthings like ketamine, or\nare more engineering based,\nthings like Transcranial magnetic\nstimulation for instance,\nmany of those are paired\nwith forms of talk therapy\nthat are really about the\nsame thing that play is about,\nwhich is exploring\ndifferent contingencies.\nIt's about exploring different types\nof emotional experiences\nas they relate to the\nsame sort of scenario\nthat created the trauma.\nAnd we did an entire\nepisode on fear and trauma,\nand I recommend you\ncheck out that episode.\nIt's easy to find again\nat hubermanlab.com,\nit's on YouTube, Apples,\nSpotify, et cetera, et cetera,\nvery easy to find.\nAnd there I talk all\nabout trauma treatments\nand the various kinds of trauma treatments\nthat are out there,\ntheir efficacy in different\nscenarios and traumas and so on.\nBut the point I'd like to make now is that\nthe reason why children who\nexperience a lot of trauma\nand stress have limited\nplasticity later on\nis because the neurochemical substrates\nthat are created from trauma and stress,\nbecause after all\nstress is epinephrine and\nepinephrine is stress.\nThose are inseparable\nand the way in which it\nmore or less shuts down\nor at least inhibits suppresses\nthose play circuits.\nAnd again the reassuring thing\nis that by engaging in play as adults,\nwe can reactivate some of those circuits\nand reopen the plasticity.\nIn fact one very prominent\ntrauma treatment now,\nespecially for people\nthat have been subjected\nto very severe traumas,\nin the ongoing sense,\nmeaning traumas that went\non for many, many years\nis to get them to engage in play\nin things like dance\nin basically getting them to engage\ntheir bodily movements\nin ways that they would otherwise\nnot feel comfortable to engage in.\nAnd I find this area so interesting\nbecause on the face of it, you could say,\noh, that's kind of, you know,\nis that really biomedical treatment?\nYou know, you're taking\npeople who traumatized\nand having them dance.\nI mean, it seems kind of\nsilly on the one hand,\ndepending on your, you know,\nyour particular orientation.\nBut on the other hand,\nit's actually quite\nprofound and quite grounded\nin the mechanisms by which\nthe brain circuits change.\nSo again,\nback to this original principle,\nwhich is that play, isn't\njust one portal to plasticity\nplay is the fundamental\nportal to plasticity\nand that play and dance\nand exploration of novel movements,\nexploration of novel athletic movements\nare the route\nby which we access new ways of thinking\nnew contingencies.\nAnd I find it wonderful\nthat the trauma release\nand the psychiatric and\npsychology community\nare exploring things like play and dance\nand other forms of\nreopening these circuits\nbecause indeed we would all love\nfor there to be a magic pill\nby which trauma could be erased\nand new memories could be laid down\nor a device that could do that.\nBut frankly, if you ask me\nor a number of my colleagues,\nwhether or not that's likely\nto happen anytime soon\nin an effective way,\nI think the short answer\nis going to be no,\nthat there are going to be chemicals\nand things that can augment\nand support that process,\nbut that there's not going\nto be just a magic pill\nthat will suddenly\nreverse trauma altogether.\nThat it's always going\nto be a case whereby\nshifts in neurochemical states\nare going to have to be combined\nwith new ways of thinking\nand new behaviors.\nAnd I find it wonderful in reassuring\nthat people are looking\nat play and play behavior\nas a not just one tiny\nshard of possibility there,\nbut that it might actually\nbe the main driver\nand a highly productive lever\nby which to rewire the traumatized brain.\nSo if you're like me,\nyou might be thinking,\nokay, I'm willing to be more playful.\nI'm willing to explore,\nplay as a portal to plasticity.\nAnd that all makes good sense,\nbut what should I play?\nWhat should I do?\nWell, we've already established\nthat you want to keep\nyour adrenaline low.\nYou have to keep the stakes slow enough\nthat you're not going to get\ntotally consumed by the outcome.\nNow, for some people who\nare highly competitive,\nthat's going to be challenging.\nAnd yet I don't want to make it seem\nas if you can't be\ncompetitive during play.\nThere are many forms of competitive play\nthat because you are a competitive person,\nallow you to drive great joy\nfrom that competitive play.\nI have a friend who's\nparticularly good at horseshoes.\nI'm not particularly good at horseshoes,\nbut whenever we play horseshoes,\nI can tell he's out there\nto crush me on horseshoes.\nAnd it's just one of these\nthings where, you know,\nI can tell he derives great pleasure\nfrom crushing me at a game of horseshoes.\nI can't say because I\nhaven't actually done\nthe microdialysis,\nwhich is a way of extracting chemistry\nfrom the brain in real time,\nnor have I recorded from his\nbrain or image it in a scanner,\nwhether or not he has\nhigh levels of epinephrine\nor low levels of epinephrine.\nDuring those games of horseshoes,\nI suspect his low levels of epinephrine\nand high levels of dopamine,\nespecially when he wins.\nAnd he has, he wins every time.\nBut the win is that you can\nbe competitive during play,\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\nOkay, you can be competitive\nprovided that you were enjoying yourself.\nThere are particular forms of play\nthat lend themselves\nbest to neuroplasticity.\nAnd those particular forms of play again,\nare not designed to\nnecessarily just engage\nthe plasticity that allows\nyou to perform that behavior,\nbut rather to expand the\nnumber of possibilities\nfor your brain to change\nin general throughout life\nand the two major forms of those\nfor which there's good\nPeer Reviewed Research\nis to engage in novel forms of movement,\nincluding different speeds of movement.\nSo let's say for instance,\nyou're somebody who runs.\nI happen to like running.\nI try and run three times a week.\nAnd generally when I run, I run forward,\nI don't run backward, although recently,\nbecause I've become very excited\nabout the work of so-called\n\"Knees Over Toes Guy,\"\nhis name is Ben Parker,\nbut he goes by \"Knees Over\nToes Guy\" on Instagram.\nI've never met him,\nbut we've exchanged a few\nmessages back and forth.\nAnd some of his practices involve\nwalking backwards or doing\nsled poles backwards.\nI found these to be very beneficial\nfor my back and for my,\nyou know, interior tibialis\nand some things that have really helped\nwith my posture and so forth.\nBut in general, when I run, I run forward,\nI don't tend to run backward that much.\nAnd I might do that for\na few minutes at the end,\nbut not so much throughout the entire run.\nRunning doesn't lend itself\nto a lot of novel forms\nof movement, lateral movements.\nSo for the nerds out there\nmovement in the Sagittal plane\nor angled movements,\nbut it does appear that\nthings like dance or sports\nwhere you end up generating\na lot of dynamic movements\nwhere there's jumping,\nwhere there's movement\nat different angles,\nwhere there's ducking,\nwhere there's leaping,\nthat basically involve a\nlot of dynamic movement.\nAnd aren't just strictly linear.\nThose seem to open the\nportals for plasticity.\nAnd that's because they mimic\na lot of the brain circuitry\nthat is associated with play.\nAnd the reason for that\nis the way in which\nthose dynamic movements\nand movements of different speeds\nengage the vestibular system.\nThe balance system,\nthe vestibular system is in the inner ear,\nrelates to the cerebellum,\nwhich translates the mini brain.\nYou got a little mini brain\nin the back of your brain.\nIt brings together visual\ninformation in a very direct way.\nI talked a lot about this in the episode\non how to learn faster.\nSo if you want to go in\ndepth on how vestibular\nand different types of motor\nmovements can open plasticity,\nI talk a little bit more, I\nshould say a lot more there,\nbut suffice to say that engaging in play\nthat has a lot of dynamic movement\nor movements of different speeds,\nthings like dance,\nthings like sports,\nlike soccer where you're\nmoving in different dimensions.\nThat tends to be very conducive\nto what we would call\nplay related circuitry\nprovided you don't take it too seriously.\nYou don't get those high\nlevels of epinephrine.\nNow for those of you that\nare also interested in non-physical\nor non-athletic forms of play\nthat can really expand plasticity.\nThere's some very interesting research\nabout the game of Chess.\nI don't play the game of Chess.\nI've played a few times.\nI confess I don't know how\nto move all the pieces.\nSo I'm not going to try\nand describe that here,\nbut I've always wanted to learn Chess.\nAnd I think after reading some\nof the Peer Reviewed Research\nabout chess and play and neuroplasticity,\nnow I understand why\nthere's a really nice paper\npublished in the International\nJournal of Research\nin Education and Science in 2017.\nAnd the title of this paper is,\n\"Is Chess Just a Game or Is It a Mirror\nThat Reflects a Child's Inner World?\"\nThat's a very, a very intense title\nfor a biologist like me,\nbut this paper is so interesting\nbecause what it really points to is\nthe fact that in a single game chess,\nyou have at least as I\nunderstand two players,\nand those two players are moving\npieces on the chess board,\nfor which each piece can\ndo different things, right?\nCan move in different ways\nunder different scenarios,\nbut they're different\nrules for different pieces.\nAnd so each player actually has to assume\nmultiple identities during the same game.\nAnd each of those identities\nhas different rules\nand ways of interacting.\nSo in a way we can think\nof chess as one game,\nbut actually chess is\na kind of a substrate\nfor exploring multiple roles\nfor different characters.\nAnd this is quite a bit different\nthan for instance, video games\nwhere somebody has their\nfavorite video game player,\nor they have an avatar.\nAnd they're always in the same role.\nIt's also quite a bit different\nfor when you engage in any kind of play\nwhere you are yourself,\nyou're just being you in that game.\nAnd so now I'm highly\nincentivized to explore chess.\nYou see quotes out there, for instance,\nthings like \"Chess is life\nor jiu jitsu is life.\"\nI always assumed that that\nmeant that someone's entire life\nwas chess\nor their entire life was\njiu jitsu for instance,\nbut in reading over the research\nabout chess in particular,\nbut at also certain forms of martial arts,\nalso certain forms of dance.\nWhat one finds is that\nindeed those games are life\nin the sense that they involve\nadopting multiple roles\nand exploring contingencies\nin a number of different ways.\nSo there are some games\nthat allow you to explore\na much vaster landscape\nof movements or of mental roles\nor of ways of engaging\nin strategic movement\nas is the case with chess.\nAnd so when you hear that,\nyou know, activity blank is life.\nIt often reflects the\npassion for that activity,\nbut I think looked at differently.\nIt also reflects the\nfact that that activity\nis a portal through which\nyou can explore life\nthrough many, many different lenses.\nAnd I think that that's\nespecially powerful\nin terms of thinking about how play\ncan be leveraged for plasticity.\nSo for those of you that are\ninterested in leveraging play\nfor neuroplasticity and\nexpanding your mind,\nif you will,\nI highly recommend picking an activity\nthat will allow you to\nadopt different roles\nwithin that activity\nwhere it's not rigidly linear.\nThis is actually a way in which\nI start to depart from\nthis modern and important,\nbut somewhat narrow idea.\nThat exercise is the\nonly route to plasticity.\nYes, it's true.\nI have Nobel Prize winning colleagues\nthat swim for two miles a day\nand have done on that for a long time.\nAnd they will tell you,\nI always think more\nclearly after my swimming\nand I certainly in my\nexperience after a good run\nor a good workout, my\nmind seems to work best.\nUnless of course, that workout\nwas very, very intense.\nI've talked about this before.\nIf you do work out very, very hard\nin whether or not it's aerobic\nor resistance training\nor sport of any kind,\nyou brain won't function\nas well afterwards,\nmostly because of the diversion of oxygen\nto tissues away from your brain,\nyou actually are getting\nless oxygen to your brain,\nbut in general,\nmost of us feel that if\nwe exercise regularly,\nour brain functions better.\nBut there are activities that\nextend beyond linear exercise,\nbeyond just generating\nthe same sets of movements\nover and over again,\nwhen or not it's exercise or not.\nAnd that's really what play is.\nPlay is about dynamically\nexploring different kinds\nof movements,\ndynamically exploring\ndifferent kinds of thoughts,\ndynamically exploring\ndifferent kinds of roles\nthat one could adopt.\nAnd that is the way that\nthe brain learns new things.\nSo I encourage you to explore chess.\nI intend to learn chess this year.\nI'm very excited to do that.\nNow, if you already play chess\nand you are an expert chess player,\nyou actually will derive less benefit\nin terms of this play\ninduced neuroplasticity\nthan you would, for instance,\nif you went out,\nand I don't know, played a game of soccer\nor did something that was very novel\nfor your nervous system,\nbecause in that novelty\nand in that exploration of new behaviors\nand new ways of thinking,\nyou are opening the portal to plasticity,\nwhereas in doing what you\nalready know how to do\nand trying just to perform\nbetter and better at it,\nyou will get better at chess,\nbut again, that's just chess.\nYou are not expanding the realms\nin which you can become more plastic,\nthat you are able to learn new things\nin relationship,\nin life, in finance and\nfriendship, et cetera.\nIn researching this episode,\none of the most interesting\nareas I discovered\nwas this notion of personal play identity,\npersonal play identity is a term\nthat at least to my\nknowledge was coined by\na Turkish researcher by the name.\nAnd forgive me, I'm going\nto mispronounce this\nis Gökhan Güneş\nG O K H A N,\nlast name G U N E S.\nAnd forgive me Gökhan\nand if we have any Turkish\nspeaking members of the audience,\nplease put the correction in\nthe comment section on YouTube,\nmake it fanatic so I can\nunderstand what it is.\nPlease I'd love to\ncorrect it and apologies,\nor who knows if I got it right\nthen it was pure luck.\nGökhan Güneş has coined this\nterm personal play identity,\nand the key role that\npersonal play identity\nestablishes in who we\nsee ourselves as being,\nand not just in the context of play.\nPersonal play identity\nhas four well defined dimensions.\nAnd I should say that if you're interested\nin learning more about this,\nthe paper that I found\nparticularly informative\nis published in Current Psychology\nand the title is \"Personal play identity\nand the fundamental elements\nin its development process.\"\nAnd the author of course,\nis Gökhan Güneş G U N E S last name.\nThis is from 2021.\nSo recent review.\nThere are four components\nto personal play identity,\nhow you play,\nyour personality,\nsocio culture and environment.\nSo that's the third one that's together,\nsocio culture environment,\nand economics and technology.\nNow that sounds somewhat complex,\nand this paper is somewhat complex,\nbut basically what it says is that\nwe bring together certain\naspects of ourselves\nand how we react to\ndifferent place scenarios\nwhen we're younger.\nAnd we bring that forward into the world.\nIn all context as adults.\nTo illustrate this,\nI'm going to ask you a question,\nwhen you were a child,\nlet's say 10 years old,\nwould you have considered\nyourself competitive?\nWould you have considered yourself\nsomebody who's cooperative?\nAnd realize of course\nthat those are not mutually exclusive,\nyou could be competitive and cooperative.\nWould you consider yourself somebody\nthat preferred to play alone\nor preferred to play with\none or two close friends?\nOr were you somebody that\nreally enjoyed playing\nin large groups?\nHere's a key one.\nWere you somebody that enjoyed\nplaying the leader in one moment\nand was equally okay\nwith being a follower at a later moment?\nWere you okay with\nhaving your role switched\nmidway through a game?\nWere you get up upset or be delighted\nor not care at all about\nhaving to switch teams\nduring the middle of game\nbecause your team was winning right?\nTo even things out,\nyou can imagine how that\nwould play out internally.\nYou would immediately register\nthat you must be a valuable player\nbecause you're being\nmoved off the winning team\ntoward the losing team.\nBut then again,\nyou're now being forced\nto join the losing team.\nHow did you feel about that?\nWere you somebody that was comfortable\nwith other people breaking rules\nor perhaps even yourself breaking rules\nor bending rules,\nkind of be able to find term,\nor were you somebody that\nreally needed to know all the rules?\nAnd if everyone didn't\nrigidly adhere to those rules\nwas quite disturbed by that?\nThe number of questions\ngoes on and on and on.\nAnd I will provide a link to a paper\nthat asks a number of questions\nthat helps you arrive at\na sort of score of sorts\nor an index of what Güneş\nand others have referred\nto as personal play identity.\nThe point is that\nif we look back to our early adolescence,\nsomewhere between 10 and 14 years old,\na peak time for social development,\na peak time for play of various kinds,\na peak time for motor development,\na peak time of psychosocial development,\nwhere we learn where we\nfit into hierarchies.\nAs we relate to members of the same sex\nof the opposite sex, et cetera,\nwe can start to get a portal into\nhow and why we show up to\nvarious activities in work\nand relationship, et cetera, as adults.\nIn fact,\nI'll venture to say that\nif we go into that process\nfor ourselves for five or 10 minutes,\nyou start to see some remarkable parallels\nbetween the way you were at that stage\nand your tendencies and\nyour preferences as adults.\nWe tend to look at our\nearly childhood experiences\nand our families,\nand to some degree our friends\nin terms of how we become who we become.\nI've talked about the\nincredible work of Allan Schore\non previous episodes of the podcast.\nAllan Schore is a psychiatrist\nand has done extensive work\non how parent child\ninteractions in particular baby\nand mother,\nbut also baby and father\nshaped the brain\nand the brain and\nemotional system's ability\nto go from states of\nelation and excitement,\nthe so-called dopamine\nepinephrine type circuitry\nto the more warm soothing\ntypes of calm interactions\nthat in broad terms could be described\nas more serotonin oxytocin\nand things of that sort.\nThat work really points to the key roles\nthat the caregiver\nand the child you\nengaged in an early life.\nAnd that is incredible work.\nI do hope to host Dr.\nSchore on the podcast\nat some point in the\nnot too distant future,\nbut equally important of course,\nare the interactions that we export\nfrom that early laying down\nof biological circuitry\nand psychological circuitry,\nto the way we play by ourselves\nand the way we play with others\nin small numbers or in great numbers.\nAnd of course it would be the case\nthat how we played as a 10 or 12 year old\nwould impact how we\nbehave as a 16 year old\nand as a 20 year old and as a 30 year old\nand so on and so on.\nOne of my favorite things\nabout developmental biology\nand developmental psychology\nis that it is grounded in the fact\nthat we don't just have a\nchildhood and an adulthood.\nThere isn't just our child\nself and our adult self.\nAnd even though there\nare transitions around\nthe mechanisms that\nunderline neuroplasticity\nat approximately age 25,\nit is simply the case that development\nis our entire lifespan,\nthat our lifespan is one\nlong developmental arc.\nHow long depends on our\ngenetics, our lifestyle\naccidents, injury and disease of course,\nbut it is one long developmental arc.\nAnd so it shouldn't surprise us at all\nthat how we learn to play as\na 10 year old or 12 year old\nwould impact how we play\nand interact with people\nas a teenager and a young adult\nand on and on and on.\nAnd that play is the\nplace in which we explore\nin which we learn\nplay is the substrate\nby which our nervous system changes us\nfrom this hyper-connected\nbatch of neurons,\nwhere everything is\nconnected to everything,\nmore or less\nto a brain and nervous system whereby\ncertain circuits work\nwith immense proficiency\nand others are less accessible to us.\nBut again,\nthe wonderful thing about\nthe human nervous system\nis that because it is plastic\nfor the entire lifespan\nand because these two\nelements of focus and rest\ncan be deployed again\nand again, and again,\njust because neural circuits didn't form\ndoes not mean that they\ncan't form later in life.\nAnd today we've been\nfocusing on how play itself,\nthe same substrate that\nwe use during development\nto become who we are,\nis the portal by which\nwe can change who we are\nfor the better.\nSo I hope I've convinced you\nthat play is an extremely important\nfundamental homeostatically regulated\naspect of our nervous system,\nwhich is just a mouthful\nof nerd speak to say,\nplay can change your brain for the better.\nAnd that is true for every stage of life.\nThe recommendation that I make,\nand certainly the one that\nI'm going to direct it myself\nas well\nis to try and engage in at least one hour\nof pure play per week.\nNow I came to that recommendation\nbecause of the literature that says,\nwell, you need to engage\nsomething pretty repetitively.\nIt should be novel.\nSo this wouldn't be something\nthat you are exceptionally\ngood at already.\nIf you insist on doing something\nthat you're already exceptionally good at,\nthen you want to really do some free form,\nlow stakes tinkering.\nSo make it safe,\nbut make it free form.\nSo really explore things with that.\nSome people call this beginner's mind.\nAlthough I find that a little abstract,\nI like the notion of beginner's mind,\nbut sort of like,\nhow do you know if you're\nin beginner's mind?\nI think beginner's mind\nis sort of the expectation\nthat you're not going to do it well yet,\nbut play extends beyond beginner's mind.\nPlay is really about\nnot even worrying if you're\ngoing to get good at it\nor really proficient at it.\nIt's really about exploring contingencies\nwith truly low stakes.\nThat's what will allow you to access\nthese neurochemical combinations\nof elevated endogenous opioids,\nlow epinephrine, et cetera,\nthat will open up neuroplasticity.\nFor those of you that need\na little more guidance\non how to play.\nThere's a book out there\nactually learned about this\nfrom Tim Ferriss' blog,\nit's called \"Play It Away: A\nWorkaholic's Cure for Anxiety.\"\nSo that's more focused on anxiety.\nThe author is Charlie Hoehn,\nlast name H O E H N\nwill provide a link for it in\nthe show notes and caption,\n\"Play It Away: A Workaholic's\nCure for Anxiety.\"\nBut books and other resources aside,\nI think one hour of play per week\nis a reasonable amount of time\nto engage in dedicated play behavior.\nFor the purpose of opening\nup these neural circuits\nfor plasticity,\nthe key feature of course,\nis to not have immense proficiency\nin that given activity,\nor at least not the way you perform it.\nAnd if you do gain\nproficiency in that activity,\nwell, then it becomes something else\nit's no longer about\nplay it's performance.\nSo in that case,\nyou would then want to\nadopt a new play behavior.\nYou'll notice that I largely avoided\nusing the word fun\nthroughout this episode.\nFun is a somewhat abstract term\nand like many emotions and\nmany verbal descriptions\nof experience.\nIt falls short in the context of\na neurobiologic goal\ndiscussion about play.\nIf you have fun, terrific.\nSome people might find,\nhowever that engaging in play\nis kind of uncomfortable.\nWell there, your goal then\nshould be to lower your level\nof discomfort\nby focusing less on the outcomes\nand just simply engaging\nin the behavior because,\nwell, I'm telling you\nthat it's good for you,\nbut hopefully you will tell yourself\nthat it's good for you\nand that you will experience\nthat it's good for you.\nThe literature certainly points to that.\nAnd the literature certainly\npoints to the fact that\nplay is the way that we are built.\nWe are built to play.\nWe have brain circuits from back to front\nand within our body that are there\nfor play and they don't disappear.\nThey do not get pruned away\nas we go from development to adulthood.\nSo if ever you needed a\nneurobiological explanation\nfor why play is important\nthroughout the lifespan,\nit's that.\nIt's that biology does\nnot waste resources.\nIt's a extremely efficient.\nAnd were the circuits for\nplay not to be important\nin adulthood.\nThey would've been pruned\naway, but I guarantee you,\nthey are there in your brain\nand nervous system now,\nthey will be there tomorrow\nand they will be there going forward.\nSo my suggestion is that you use them.\nOne hour per week.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube Channel.\nThat's
