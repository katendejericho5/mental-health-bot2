    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're going to talk\nall about how to optimize\nyour workspace for maximum productivity.\nIndeed, that means to\nheighten levels of focus,\nto increase levels of creativity,\nto improve your ability to task switch.\nAnd this could be for sake\nof school or for work,\ncreative endeavors, personal endeavors,\nthis really extends to everybody.\nMost often when we hear about how to focus\nor how to get the most\nout of our work sessions,\nwe hear about the biology\nand the psychology of that.\nWe hear about dopamine and\nwe hear about serotonin\nand we hear about caffeine.\nAnd indeed, those are topics\nthat I've covered a lot\non The Huberman Lab Podcast.\nToday, we will touch on each of those,\nbut we are mainly going\nto focus on how we arrange\nour physical environment and\nindeed how we arrange ourselves\nin that physical environment,\nin order to bring out the\nbest in our neurobiology.\nThat is how to put ourselves\ninto a heightened state of\nfocus by virtue of things,\nas simple as where we place our\nscreen, relative to our eyes\nat a given time of day.\nBelieve it or not, there's\nexcellent research on this,\nand there's excellent\nresearch for instance,\non whether or not you should\nor should not listen to music,\nwhether or not you should use\nthings like binaural beats,\nand if so, what frequency\nof binaural beats.\nWe are going to cover all\nof that, and by the end,\nyou'll have a checklist\nof things that you can do\nto optimize your workspace on any budget.\nI will mention various products and apps\nthat some of you might find useful\nfor optimizing your workspace.\nBut I want to emphasize at\nthe outset that none of those\nthat I mentioned are any products or apps\nthat we have a financial relationship to.\nAnd more importantly, you don't need them.\nI'm going to explain how for zero cost,\nyou can arrange your workspace in ways\nthat makes you maximally\nproductive, maximally focus\nand allows you to adapt your workspace\nto different environments,\nwhether or not you're traveling,\nworking with others,\nworking alone, et cetera.\nJust to give you a little\nhint of where we are going,\nI will mention a zero\ncost app that will deliver\nbinaural beats at a particular frequency\nthat peer-reviewed research\nhas shown can enhance\ncertain types of learning and memory.\nHowever, peer-reviewed research also shows\nthat it can diminish performance\nin other types of tasks.\nSo stay tuned, we'll\ngo into all the details\nso that you can optimize\nyour workspace for zero cost\nand get the most out of\nyour efforts and endeavors.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is LMNT.\nLMNT is an electrolyte drink\nthat has everything you need\nand none of the things you don't.\nAnd when we say everything you\nneed, the main one is salt.\nNow, salt, aka sodium\nhas kind of a bad rap.\nWe've all heard that too\nmuch salt is bad for us.\nHowever, if you look into\nthe research on salt,\nand in fact, if you go to\none of the highest level,\npeer-reviewed scientific\npublications, Science Magazine,\nyou can find a review article\nin science some years ago\nthat shows that most of\nwhat we think and understand\nabout the science of\nsalt is completely wrong.\nAnd in fact, salt does a number of things\nthat's extremely important.\nFor instance, our neurons,\nwhich signal to one another\nthrough electricity and\nthrough chemical signaling,\ncritically rely on having enough sodium\nin order to generate what\nwe call action potentials\nor electrical firing of neurons.\nIf your sodium levels are too low,\nyour neurons simply won't work.\nOne of the main deficits\nfrom being dehydrated\nis lack of sodium, not just lack of water.\nGetting sufficient sodium\ndoes a number of things\nthat's very important, it\ncan raise your blood volume,\nit can help you retain\nwater in a healthy way,\nnot excess amounts.\nIt allows neurons to fire\nfor sake of thinking,\nfor sake of athletic\nperformance, and so on.\nOther electrolytes that are in LMNT\nare things like magnesium and potassium,\nwhich are also essential\nfor neuronal function,\nand indeed all organ function.\nLMNT has a lot of salt, some magnesium\nand some potassium, so\nunless you're somebody\nwho really has chronic hypertension,\nelevating your level of salt\nintake can often be beneficial.\nYou should check with your doctor,\nbut indeed it can often be beneficial.\nLMNT contains a science-backed\nelectrolyte ratio\nof a 1,000 milligrams,\nthat's one gram of sodium,\n200 milligrams of potassium\nand 60 milligrams of magnesium.\nIt tastes delicious, I\nhappen to like the raspberry\nor citrus flavors, in fact,\nI like all of the flavors.\nPut in some water, you\ncan make it as dense,\nmeaning as high concentration as you like.\nSo some people will put it\nin eight ounces of water.\nI like mine in about 16 ounces of water\nand I'll drink that\nbefore and after exercise.\nAnd I usually will have\nanother one throughout the day,\njust sip on it as I'm\ndoing work and so forth.\nIf you'd like to try LMNT,\nyou can go to

pack.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens,\nnow referred to as AG1.\nI started taking AG1 way back in 2012,\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started taking AG1\nand the reason I still take\nAG1 once or twice a day\nis that it helps me meet all\nof my foundational vitamin,\nmineral and probiotic needs.\nAnd when people ask me,\nwhat's the one supplement\nI should take, if they were\nto only take one supplement,\nI always recommend AG1.\nFor the simple reason that the vitamins,\nthe minerals and the probiotic\nsupport metabolic health,\nthey support endocrine health,\nthey support brain health\nand the probiotics and prebiotics\nin there in particular,\nsupport the so-called gut-brain axis.\nThere is now a plethora of\ndata supporting the fact\nthat when we have a\nhealthy gut microbiome,\nthat has little microbes\nthat live in our gut,\nthat are good for us, our\ngut signals to our brain\nand our brain signals back to\nour gut, in ways that support\nour immune system, our\ndigestion, even our mood.\nThey can even support healthy\nlevels of dopamine signaling,\nan important molecule for motivation\nand high levels of mood or positive mood.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free\ntravel packs plus a year supply\nof vitamin D3 K2.\nVitamin D3 K2 has been\nshown to be important\nfor metabolic health, endocrine health\nand K2 in particular for heart health\nand regulating appropriate\namounts of calcium in your bones.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim the special offer.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Theragun.\nTheragun is a handheld percussive device\nthat releases deep muscle tension.\nI was first introduced to\nTheragun on a shark diving trip.\nWe were way out in the Pacific,\nfilming great white sharks\nfor my laboratory where we study fear,\nand everyone was diving all day,\ncarrying what are called Pelican cases,\nwhich aren't actual pelicans with wings,\nbut cases for these cameras.\nThey're very heavy,\nremoving things all day,\nwe're working really hard,\nand we got really sore.\nI got particularly sore from\nall that physical labor.\nSomeone brought a Theragun along,\nI'd never seen one of these\nthings before or tried one\nand I spent the rest of the\ntrip trying to get as much time\nwith the Theragun as I could,\nat least when I was on board the boat.\nWith Theragun, you can\nget what is effectively\na deep tissue massage to\nany area of your body,\nand you can just do that\nfor minutes or hours\nfor as long as you like,\nit's really wonderful.\nIf you have someone else there,\nwho's willing to use the\nTheragun on hard to reach places\nlike your back, that's even better.\nWhether or not you want\nto treat muscle tension\nfrom working out and injury\nor just deal with daily stress\nfrom everyday life, there's\nreally no substitute\nfor the Theragun.\nYou know, professional\nmassage is wonderful,\nbut a professional\nmassage of course involves\ngoing to a masseuse, it's quite\nexpensive often, et cetera.\nIf you're interested\nin getting a Theragun,\nthey start at only $199.\nYou can go to\nTheragun.com/huberman right now\nto get your Gen 4 Theragun today.\nYou have a 30-day money back guarantee,\nthat's Theragun.com/huberman.\nLet's talk about workspace optimization.\nThis is a topic that's intrigued\nme for a very long time\nbecause my undergraduate\nadvisor, my graduate advisor\nand my postdoc advisor\nhad many things in common,\nincluding being great\nscientists, being kind people\nand terrific mentors, but they\nhad another thing in common,\nwhich always perplexed me,\nwhich is that their offices\nwere a complete disaster.\nThey had mountains of\nbooks, mountains of papers,\nmountains of all sorts of stuff.\nAnd yet all of them were\nextremely productive\nand could remain extremely focused\nin that incredibly cluttered environment.\nNow I'm somebody who doesn't like clutter,\nI find it very hard to focus\nin cluttered environments.\nAnd indeed there's tremendous\nvariation among people\nas to whether or not\nthey can remain focused\nor whether or not they struggle to focus\nin physically cluttered environments.\nThere's no right or wrong to this,\nbut the question we should ask ourselves\nis why were they all\nable to be so focused?\nAnd it turns out that\nthe reason they were able\nto be so focused is that\nthey all captured one single\nand yet fundamental variable\nof workspace optimization.\nAnd we'll talk about\nwhat that variable is.\nIn fact, where you're to talk\nabout what all the variables\nof optimizing a workspace\nare things like vision,\nthings like light, things\nlike noise in the room,\nwhether or not you listen to music or not,\nwhether or not you use noise\ncanceling headphones or not.\nWe're going to talk about all of that\nand we're going to do that in a way\nthat you can optimize your workspace,\nregardless of whether\nor not you are at home,\nwhether or not you're\non the road, et cetera.\nBecause the last thing\nI would ever want to do\nis to create a situation where you find\nthe optimal workspace,\nand then you are a slave\nto that optimal workspace.\nThat's just not the way the world works.\nWhat you want to do or\nmy goal for you rather,\nis that you will have a\nshort checklist of things\nthat you can look to, anytime\nyou sit down to do work,\nand you can think about\nthe underlying variables\nthat impact your brain and your body\nand allow your brain and body\nto get into the optimal state\nin order to learn, in\norder to be productive\nand indeed to move through your\nwork bouts in a very relaxed\nand pleasureful way\nwhile maintaining focus\nand while pursuing any\nof the number of things\nthat you're doing.\nThe first variable we want to think about\nin terms of workspace\noptimization is vision and light.\nOn a previous episode of\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast,\ndevoted all to habits, I\ntalked about the importance\nof dividing your 24 hour day\ninto three different phases.\nAnd for those of you that\nhaven't heard that episode,\nI'm just going to briefly\nsummarize what I described.\nFrom the time you wake up in\nthe morning until about six\nor seven or eight,\nsometimes nine hours later,\nyour brain is in a unique state.\nIt is in a state of\nhigh levels of dopamine,\na neuromodulator, and\nhigh levels of epinephrin,\nas well as hormones like\ncortisol and so forth.\nWithout going into the\nbiology of those things,\nthey set your brain into\na state of high alertness.\nAnd this is true, whether or not\nyou indulge in caffeine or not.\nI know some of you say, oh,\nI really don't wake up\nuntil the afternoon,\nI'm much more alert and\nfocused in the afternoon.\nWe will talk about that phase\nof the 24 hour day in a moment.\nBut that early part of\nthe day is a time of day\nin which for sake of\nworkspace optimization,\nbeing in a brightly lit\nenvironment can lend itself\nto optimal work throughout the day,\nnot just during that early phase.\nAnd so while on many\nepisodes of this podcast,\nI've also emphasized the\nimportance of getting\nmorning sunlight in your eyes\nwithin 30 to 60 minutes of waking,\nnot as often, but now, and\nagain, I will also mention\nthat it's important to light\nyour daytime environment\nas brightly as you safely can.\nSo if you are going to be\ndoing work in this early,\nwhat I call phase one portion of your day,\nyou want to have as much light and indeed\nas much overhead light shining\non you as safely possible.\nAnd of course you don't want\nit so bright that it's glaring\nand you have to squint, et cetera,\nbut you want as much light\nas is safely possible.\nAnd you can do that a\ncouple of simple ways.\nOne is if do own or\nyou're in an environment,\nwe have overhead lights, turn\non those overhead lights.\nWhat's special about overhead\nlights for setting alertness\nis that the neurons in\nour eyes, which are called\nmelanopsin ganglion cells,\nthat's the fancy name.\nMelanopsin ganglion\ncells are mainly enriched\nin the lower half of\nour retinas in our eyes\nand view the upper visual field.\nThose neurons send little wires to an area\nof our hypothalamus, right\nabove the roof of our mouth,\nthat creates a state of alertness.\nNow, early in the day, we want\nto be as alert as possible.\nAnd this phase one of our circadian cycle\nis when we are best at doing\nanalytic detailed type work.\nSo we're going to go into other aspects\nof workspace optimization that\nare important for phase one,\nbut during phase one, again,\nwithin zero to about eight\nor nine hours after waking, bright lights\nin your environment, in\nparticular overhead lights,\nare going to facilitate focus,\nthey're going to facilitate\nfurther release of things like\ndopamine and norepinephrine\nand healthy amounts of cortisol.\nAnd we want that to\nhappen early in the day\nfor a variety of reasons.\nFor instance, we don't\nwant that cortisol peak\nto happen too late in the day.\nThat's actually associated\nwith depression and insomnia\nand a number of things\nthat we just don't want.\nSo one of the things that\nI've done for my workspace\nis to make sure that when\nI wake up in the morning,\nI do go get my sunlight.\nIf the sun isn't out, I turn on\nas many bright artificial\nlights as I can manage\nor tolerate, and then I go\nget my sunlight exposure.\nBut once I set out to do some work\nthat all the overhead\nlights in that room are on,\nas well as lights in front of me.\nAnd that's again to stimulate\nheightened levels of focus\nand further release of\nthese neuromodulators\nthat I mentioned before, dopamine,\nnorepinephrine and epinephrine.\nNow the way that one could do that\ncould be a very low cost\nway of having, for instance,\na desk lamp and those overhead lights.\nIf you're somebody that wants to take this\nto the next level, you can\npurchase a ring light, which is,\nI think those are mainly made for people\ndoing selfie type videos,\nfor Instagram posts\nand things of that sort.\nRing lights can be pretty cost-effective,\nand yet they're very bright and\nthey have the sort of bright\nblue light that is going\nto optimally stimulate\nthose melanopsin ganglion cells.\nSo some people I know\nwill have a blue light\nor a bright LED on their\ndesk in front of them.\nAnd indeed I have one of these,\nI don't use a ring light,\nI use a light pad.\nThe particular light pad\nI use, I bought on Amazon.\nI can mention the brand, but again,\nI have no financial affiliation to them,\nthis is the Artograph Lightpad\nis designed for drawing.\nAnd it says on it 930 lux,\nLux is just a measure of brightness.\nSo I place that on the desk in\nfront of me and I turn it on\nessentially throughout\nthis phase one of the day.\nEven if I walk away from the\ndesk, I tend to keep it on,\nit doesn't consume that much energy.\nAnd in that way, I'm constantly\nbeing bombarded with photons\nthat keep my levels of alertness up\nbecause the early part of the day\nis when I do the majority\nof that focused work.\nAgain, you don't need the light pad,\nyou can use a ring light,\nor you can simply use\nany kind of other lights\nthat you might happen to\nhave artificial lights.\nFor those of you that can\nplace your desk near a window,\nand even better to open the window,\nthat would be really fantastic.\nI don't have access to that.\nWhy would I say open the window?\nWell, it turns out that sunlight\nis going to be the best stimulus\nfor waking up your brain\nand body through this\nmelanopsin hypothalamus system.\nAnd by looking at\nsunlight through a window,\nit's 50 times less effective\nthan if that window\nwere to be open, mostly because\nthose windows filter out\na lot of the wavelengths of blue light\nthat are essential for\nstimulating the eyes\nand this wake-up signal.\nSo all of this has rests on the premise\nthat we need to be alert\nin order to do our work,\nin particular focused work.\nAnd I've talked about before\nin the Habits episode,\nand I'm saying again now,\nthat first phase of the day,\nthat first seven or eight\nor nine hours of the day\nis really the time in\nwhich our neurochemistry\nis primed for getting the most amount\nof focused kind of challenging work done\nwhere a lot of precision\nand detail is required.\nSo you want to brightly\nlight your work environment\nduring that first phase, again,\nfrom the time you wake up,\ntry and get sunlight, but\nthen even if you're going\nto get exercise or do other things,\nyou want to get as much\nbright light in your eyes\nas you safely can\nand then you want to light\nyour work environment.\nNow in the afternoon,\nstarting at about nine\nand continuing until about\n16 hours after waking,\nyou want to start dimming the\nlights in that environment.\nNow you don't want to make it dark\nbecause you don't want to get sleepy\nat two o'clock in the afternoon,\nunless you're going to take a brief nap,\nwhich I do and is perfectly fine,\nas long as it doesn't interfere\nwith your nighttime sleep.\nBut the idea is that in\nthis so-called phase two\nof the 24 hour cycle from\nabout nine to 16 hours\nafter waking, you want to bring\nthe level of lights down a bit.\nAnd when I say down,\nI literally mean down.\nHaving lights that are\nin front of you is fine,\nbut overhead lights at that\ntime are not going to be optimal\nfor the sorts of neurochemical states\nthat your brain wants to be in.\nThe states that I'm\nreferring to are a shift\nfrom the dopamine and norepinephrine\nthat's highest early\nin the day to increases\nin things like serotonin\nand other neuromodulators\nthat put your brain into\na state that's better\nfor creative endeavors or\nfor more abstract thinking.\nNow, as we'll soon see, there\nare other things you can do\nto improve creative thinking\nand abstract thinking.\nAnd in fact, there are things you can do\nto improve analytic thing,\nand we will talk about those,\nthings that are distinct from light,\nbut right now we're\njust focusing on light.\nSo what I recommend doing,\nand what I personally do\nis I will turn off overhead\nlights in the afternoon.\nIt's not completely dim,\nit's not completely dark,\nbut I will start to reduce\nthe amount of overhead light\nand just simply keep the light pad on\nand whatever other lamps\nI happen to be using.\nNow, one thing we haven't talked\nabout is screen brightness.\nThis is highly individual,\npeople have different\nretinal sensitivities.\nWhat I mean by that is everybody differs\nin terms of how bright they can tolerate\ntheir visual environment and their screen.\nAnd whether or not you are\nsensitive to light or not,\nwill depend on a lot of factors.\nSome of it is eye color,\nindeed people with darker color eyes\ngenerally can tolerate more\nbright light than others.\nI have green eyes, I am very,\nvery sensitive to light.\nIf I'm outdoors at a cafe or something,\nand the table has any kind\nof reflective properties\nand it's a sunny day, I\ncan barely see the person\nacross the table from me,\nunless I'm wearing sunglasses.\nSome people, other members\nof my family for instance,\nhave dark brown eyes\nand can just sit there\nand have a conversation without the need\nfor sunglasses at all.\nSo that's, there's\ntremendous variation there,\none or the other isn't healthy\nor advantageous necessarily,\njust understand that you never\nwant to be in an environment\nwhere it's painful to maintain\nlooking at whatever it is\nthat you're looking at.\nIf something's painful to look at,\nit could be damaging to your eyes,\nso you do want to protect your eyes.\nNow, in this second phase of the day,\nsince most of us are working indoors,\nbut even if you're working outdoors,\nyou want to try and get the\namount of light reduced overall,\nbut in particular, that overhead light,\nand you also want to start reducing\nthe amount of blue light\nthat you're being exposed to.\nSo somewhere around four or 5:00 pm,\nwhich for me is about 12\nhours after I've been awake\nor 14 hours after I've been awake,\nI will turn off that light\npad and start to transition\nthe lights in my environment\nto more yellows and reds.\nNow, I can't always do this,\nI have friends that actually\nhave converted their entire\nhomes from blue light\nearly in the day to red\nlight late in the day,\nthat's really cool and\nfantastic, I haven't done that.\nThere's a cost to doing\nthat and it is optimal\nin terms of optimizing productivity\nand sleep and so forth,\nbut it's not feasible for a lot of people.\nBut what I do is I simply\nswitch to using yellow lamps.\nI will turn off that LED\nin the later afternoon,\nagain, around four or 5:00\npm, and I tend to wake up\naround 6:00 am or so, I'll turn those off.\nAnd what I'll try and do also\nis I'll try and dim the screen\nthat I'm working on so\nthat I can still manage\nto see everything that I need to see,\nbut it's quite a bit dimmer\nthan it was early in the day.\nSo that's phase two of the day,\nand that's how we want\nto think about light.\nAnd then I'll just mention,\nbecause I know there are people\nwho are working in the\nmiddle of the night,\nthere's phase three,\nwhich is about 17 to\n24 hours after waking.\nAnd I realize that for\nshift workers or for people\nthat are pulling all\nnighters or for students,\noftentimes you need to\nbe awake and studying\nin the middle of the night.\nI, myself am somebody who\nfor years would pull anywhere\nfrom five to 10 all-nighters per year.\nI still pull an all\nnighter now, and again,\nbecause of deadlines and so forth.\nI don't recommend it, if\nyou can avoid it, great,\nbut many people just\nsimply have to do this\nfor sake of shift work or\nbecause of impending deadlines\nor procrastination or all of the above.\nIf you are going to be doing\nwork in that third phase\nof your circadian cycle,\nyou really want to limit\nthe amount of bright light that\nyou're getting in your eyes\nto just the amount that\nallows you to do the work\nthat you're doing.\nBecause if you get light in your eyes,\nthat's any brighter than that,\nyou're going to severely\ndeplete your melatonin levels.\nYou're going to severely\nshift your circadian clock\nand it's effectively like\ntraveling to another time zone.\nSo if you stay up from\n3:00 am until 6:00 am\nor 2:00 am until 4:00 am\nworking on a term paper\nor something of that sort,\nand you're getting bright\nlight in your eyes,\nyou are effectively flying six hours\nto a different time zone,\nor at least that's what\nyour body registers it as.\nAnd it can really throw your\nsleep and your metabolism\nand a number of other things out of whack.\nNow there's an exception to this,\nwhich is if you really want to be awake,\nit can often be beneficial\nto flipping on all the lights\nin the room and keeping\nthem really bright.\nOne of the hardest things to\ndo is to stay up all night\nstudying when you're in a dim environment.\nSo you have to determine the trade off\nbetween whether or not you\nwant to shift your clock\nor whether or not you\nwant to get the work done.\nAnd I would say the ideal\nsituation is to sleep at night\nand to do your work during\nthe day and in the afternoon,\nbut if you do have to be awake\nin the middle of the night,\ndo understand that you want\nto dim those lights overall.\nYou would not want to use that LED,\nyou would not want to\nhave overhead lights on,\nunless you're really\nstruggling to stay awake,\nin which case you want to get\nas many bright lights on as possible.\nSo there are a couple of\ntricks to all-nighters,\nI don't really want people\npulling all-nighters\nunless they have to, but\nthere are a few things\nthat you can do without taking stimulants\nin order to stay up all\nnight, that can be beneficial\nthat maximize on your biology.\nOne of them that's a\nlittle less commonly known\nis you can drink 32\nounces of water and commit\nto not going to the bathroom\nfor 90 minutes, at least.\nIt turns out that there is a circuit\nthat goes from your\nbladder, literally neurons\nthat go from your\nbladder to your brainstem\nand when you have to urinate,\nit makes you very alert.\nAnd as many of you have\nprobably experienced,\nthis is actually what wakes us up\nin the middle of the night when\nwe have to use the bathroom\nis this circuit for alertness\nthat goes from full bladder,\nit's signaled by the bladder\nbeing full to the brainstem.\nAnd this is the circuit that is disrupted\nin kids that have bedwetting issues.\nAnd there are a number of\ncognitive behavioral approaches\nto that, sometimes\nbedwetting in very young kids\nis because the circuit\nhasn't developed yet.\nMost adults fortunately\nare not bedwetting,\nbut you can increase the amount\nof alertness in your system\nand remain awake in the\nmiddle of the night,\nby drinking a little bit more\nwater than you normally would\nand then refraining from\ngoing to the restroom,\nthat certainly will lend\nitself to alertness.\nYou know how difficult\nit is to fall asleep\nwhen you have to use the\nrestroom for instance.\nSo that's one tool.\nThe other thing is again, to\nflip on as many bright lights\nin the environment as possible.\nAnd then of course, people\nwill rely on stimulants\nlike caffeine or even more\naggressive stimulants.\nThat's not something I\nnecessarily recommend,\nyou'll each have to\ndetermine that for you.\nBut if you do in fact,\nhave to use all-nighters\nfor any reason, you can maximize\nthis bladder to brain approach\nand the right light approach.\nSo that more or less\ncovers how bright to keep\nyour overall environment and\nhow bright to keep your screen.\nIf you really want to\nget nerdy about this,\nthere is a free app called\nLight Meter where you can start\nmeasuring how many lux, how many photons\nare in a given environment.\nIt's actually measuring\nreflectance of photons and so on,\nif you can look up what a\nLux Meter does, if you like,\nI don't necessarily recommend doing that.\nI don't want to set a\ncritical threshold by which,\nfor instance, we say,\nonce your environment\nis more than 1,500 lux,\nthen it's too bright\nor not bright enough, et cetera.\nEveryone has different\nretinal sensitivities,\neveryone will find that\ndifferent levels of brightness\nwill cause them to be alert,\ndifferent levels of dimness,\nif you will, in the room will\ncause them to feel sleepy.\nYou really want to just modulate\nacross the 24 hour cycle\nwhere it's very bright,\nas bright as safely can be\nearly in the day so that you are alert.\nYou can do your focus detailed\nwork in that first phase,\nand then in the afternoon, as you move\ninto more creative type\nworks or abstract thinking,\nor working with other people\nin kind of a brainstorming mode\nthat you would shift to\ndimmer lights, yellow lights,\neliminate the blue lights\nas much as possible.\nNow that's light, but there's\nanother aspect of vision\nthat has been shown to\nbe critically important\nfor how alert we are going to be\nand how well we can\nmaintain that alertness.\nAnd that has to do with\nwhere our visual focus is\nin a given environment.\nSo I'm not talking about\noverall brightness,\nwhat I'm referring to now is simply\nwhere you place your phone or your tablet\nor computer screen or book,\nwhatever it is that you\nhappen to be looking at.\nThere's a very underappreciated\nand yet incredible aspect\nof our neurology that has\nto do with the relationship\nbetween where we look and\nour level of alertness.\nAnd it works in a very logical way,\nwe have clusters of\nneurons in our brain stem\nand those clusters of neurons\ncontrol our eyelid muscles\nand they control our eye\nmovements up and down\ninto the sides.\nAnd indeed, if you were\nto look at an eyeball,\nI looked at a lot of eyeballs in my lab\nand I teach neural anatomy, so\nwe do this from time to time,\nwe would see that there are six muscles\nattached to your eyeball.\nNow four of them are located\nat the top, the bottom\nand the two sides of your eyeball,\nsort of at the 12 o'clock,\nsix o'clock, three o'clock\nand nine o'clock of your eyeball.\nAnd those muscles can move\nyour eye in the socket\nfrom side to side and up and down.\nAnd then we also have some muscles\nthat can actually pull\nthe eyeballs at angles.\nSo we have different muscles\nthat can move the eyes\nat different angles as well,\nand that's why we can look\nup into the side or down into the side,\nnot just from side to side or up or down.\nNow, the neurons that\ncontrol those muscles\nhave a very interesting feature,\nwhich is that when we are\nlooking down toward the ground\nor anywhere below, basically\nthe central region of our face,\nthe neurons that control that eye movement\nare intimately related\nto areas of the brainstem\nthat release certain\ntypes of neuromodulators\nand neurotransmitters.\nAnd they activate areas of\nthe brain that are associated\nwith calm and indeed, even with sleepiness\nand there's an active\ninhibition or prevention\nof neurons that increase alertness.\nNow the opposite is also\ntrue, we have neurons\nthat place our eyes into an upward gaze\nabove the sort of level of our nose\nand up above our forehead.\nLiterally looking up while\nkeeping the head stationary,\nor if you tilt your head\nback and you look up,\nthese neurons are still active.\nThose neurons don't just\ncontrol the position of the eyes\nand cause them to move up, they\nalso trigger the activation\nof brain circuits that are\nassociated with alertness.\nNow, this is a fundamental\nfeature of the way that our eyes\nand brain are wired\ntogether and how they relate\nto what we call autonomic arousal.\nAnd there are a bunch of details there.\nWe will actually have a guest\nin a few weeks who has learned\nto exploit these neurons and\nthe fact that they control\nthese different states\nof calm or alertness\nin order to generate hypnotic\nstates, to place people\ninto very atypical states\nin which they are both\nvery alert and very calm.\nWe'll save that for a future episode.\nBut the important thing to understand\nis when you are looking down\nbelow the level of your nose,\nyou are essentially\ndecelerating your alertness.\nYou're reducing your amount of alertness,\nit might be subtle, but it's happening.\nWhereas when you look straight\nahead or in particular,\nwhen you look up, you're\nincreasing your level of alertness.\nNow this has some obvious implications.\nWhen we get sleepy, our\neyelids tend to close\nand we tend to nod down,\nwhen we're wide awake,\nwe tend to be wide-eyed, we\ndon't tend to blink as often.\nAnd we tend to be chin up\nand kind of on vigilance\nand alertness.\nSo this has a evolutionary,\nor at least an adaptive component to it.\nThis can be exploited, and\nindeed it's been researched\nin terms of how it can be used\nto optimize work environments.\nContrary to what most people do,\nwhich is to look down at their\nlaptop, tablet, or phone,\nif you want to be alert\nand you want to maintain\nthe maximum amount of\nfocus for whatever it is\nthat you're reading or\ndoing, you want that screen\nor whatever it is that you're looking at\nto at least be at eye level\nand ideally slightly above it.\nNow, I haven't seen many\nworkspaces that take advantage\nof this very hardwired\nneuro-biological fact.\nSo what should you do\nwith this information?\nWell, if you're somebody\nwho sits down to do work\nand starts to feel sleepy,\nor simply unfocused,\nunable to attend to whatever\nit is that you're doing,\nI highly recommend that you\ntake your laptop or tablet.\nI do hope that most people\naren't doing serious work\non their phones because it's\nsuch a small visual window,\nand we can talk about why\nthat's an issue later.\nAnd the idea would be to place\nthat screen of your tablet\nor your laptop or other computer,\nand try and get it elevated\nat least to nose level,\nyour nose level, or even higher.\nNow I realize that can\nbe complicated to do,\nI've long, just used a stack of books,\nor I'll sometimes take a\nbox and turn upside down\nand set it there.\nI do use a mixed standing-seated desk,\nI'll talk about that in a few minutes.\nThere are a number of different\nways that you could do this,\nyou could wall mount a monitor.\nI think many people are\nworking with laptops,\nit's a little bit harder\nto do that with a laptop,\nsome people though will\nconfigure a second screen.\nYou have to decide what's\nright for you in your budget.\nBut again, in addition to\nhaving a brightly lit room,\nto be able to focus and\nattend to whatever it is\nyou're working on, you\nwant to have that screen\npositioned high in your\nvisual environment.\nNow you wouldn't want it\non the ceiling necessarily,\nI know that would be pretty cool,\nbut you do want it above you.\nNow, there are a couple solutions\nto this that don't involve\na wall mount or stacking books or boxes.\nFor instance, you could\nbe one of those people\nthat likes to lie in bed or on the sofa\nand get your screen up above you\nby putting pillows on your knees.\nI used to actually do a\nlot of my writing and work\nin the middle of the night,\nI don't do this anymore\nand I don't recommend it, but I used to do\na lot of work from bed.\nNow I no longer bring electronics\nfor work into the bedroom.\nI just really try and keep\nthe bedroom for sleeping\nor whatever else.\nBut in terms of lying down on the couch,\nit is somewhat easier to get\nthat screen up above you,\nyou can kind of slide underneath\nthat screen and get typing,\nbut there's a problem with that.\nAnd we'll talk about this a\nlittle bit more in a moment,\nbut it turns out that your posture,\nliterally the position of\nyour body relative to gravity,\nalso has important implications\nfor how alert you are.\nSo ideally you would\nbe standing or seated.\nI would say the ideal would be standing,\nsecond best will be seated\nand your screen will be\neither directly in front of\nyou or slightly above you.\nOr if you wanted to get really fancy,\nyou could create a situation\nwhere it was above you\nand slightly tilted toward\nyou so that you actually\nhad to maintain kind\nof proper neck posture.\nThis accomplishes a number of things.\nIn addition to making you more alert,\nyou also get away from\nthe so-called text neck.\nYou know, people are starting to look more\nlike C's nowadays, the\nshape of the letter C\nbecause we're constantly looking down.\nI do every once in a while,\nsee somebody who's texting\nin public with it at eye level,\nit always looks a little odd\nthat they're doing that, but\nI always admire their posture\nat the same time, so we\nshouldn't give them a hard time.\nSo this is another feature\nthat you can arrange\ninto your physical workspace.\nAgain, whether or not you're\nseated or you're standing\nthroughout the day, try and\nget that screen elevated.\nNow with reference to posture,\nthere are beautiful data\nillustrating that when we are standing up,\nthose same neurons in our brainstem,\nlocus coeruleus neurons,\nwhich release I should mention\nthings like norepinephrin and epinephrin,\nthose neurons become active\nwhen we are standing.\nThey become even more active\nwhen we are ambulatory,\nwhen we are moving and we\nwill talk about treadmilling\nand cycling at your desk and\nso forth in a little bit.\nBut when you sit, they\nbecome a little less active\nand when you lie down and\nindeed, any time that you start\nto get your feet up above your waist\nor your head tilted back,\nthose neurons fire less\nand neurons in your brain\nthat are involved in calming,\nand indeed putting you to sleep,\nstart increasing their level of firing.\nIt's a really beautiful system.\nSo beautiful, in fact,\nthat there are studies\nthat show that as you adjust\nthe angle of the body back,\nyou actually get a sort\nof dose-dependent increase\nin sleepiness and calmness\nand a dose-dependent\ndecrease in alertness.\nAnd so, as we were all\ntold to sit up straight\nor even better, just stand up straight,\nand now I'm also telling\nyou to get that visual thing\nthat you're attending\nto, screen or otherwise,\nup in front of you, or ideally above you,\nthose things combine to\ngenerate maximum alertness.\nSo you can think about\nhow you might work this\ninto various aspects of\nyour homework environment\nor office work environment.\nBut as I describe this, many\nof you are probably thinking\nwhat I'm thinking, which\nis, gosh, most of what we do\nis in complete opposite direction\nto all of this neurobiologically\ngrounded advice.\nMost of us are looking down\nat our laptop while seated,\nor we are lying down, which is\ngoing to make us more sleepy,\nor we are positioning our\ncomputers in front of us,\nbut we really aren't an\nenvironment that's bright enough\nand so on and so forth.\nSo as you can tell, we're\nstarting to layer in\nthe various things that you can do,\nfirst brightness in the room,\nsecond, get that screen up\nand try and put yourself\ninto a posture for work\nthat lends itself or promotes alertness\nif indeed, you want to\nbe alert for that work.\nIf your goal is to take a\nnap, get your feet elevated\nabout 10 to 15 degrees above your head,\nmaybe put a pillow underneath\nit, lie down and take a nap,\nbut that's not what we're\ntalking about today,\nwe're talking about\nworkspace optimization.\nAnd I suppose you could also\nexploit that all-nighter trick\nthat I talked about earlier,\nI actually did this,\nwhen I was an undergraduate,\nI was a little bit\nmasochistic in this way.\nI would drink coffee and\nwater at fairly high volume.\nI wasn't forced drinking\nor anything like that,\nbut I actually wouldn't\nallow myself to get up\nand use the bathroom except on a timer.\nSo I think the longest ever\nwent was three and a half hours.\nIt was kind of excruciating,\nI actually don't think\nthat's necessarily a\nhealthy advice, but again,\nyou can use slight, I mentioned\nslight over consumption\nof fluids in order to generate alertness.\nThat was just me really trying\nto get as much work done\nas I could, I had a very,\nvery demanding class schedule\nand it was just the only way\nthat I could get work done.\nIf I was getting up every few\nminutes, use the restroom,\nI found it hard to re-engage in that work\nand maintain focus,\nwhich is what I just want\nto briefly mention now.\nI talked about this in\nthe episode on focus,\nbut one thing that is\ncompletely unreasonable\nand that you should\nnever ask yourself to do\nis to sit down or stand\nup and immediately focus\non something, unless you're stressed\nabout what you're looking at,\nor you're very, very excited by it.\nIf you're very stressed about\nsome sort of information\nor a deadline, or you're very,\nvery excited about something,\nyou'll find that you can focus instantly\njust within a moment.\nAnd that's because of the\ndeployment of neurochemicals\nlike dopamine and norepinephrine\nthat bring about our levels of alertness.\nHowever, most of us, including myself,\nwill go to begin to work out\nand we'll find that our mind\ndoesn't quite engage at the\nlevel of depth and focus\nthat we would like right off the bat.\nI've timed this and other\nstudies have timed this\nin a more rigorous way, mine\nis just what we call anecdata,\nbut so I've timed it for myself,\nbut there are studies\nthat have looked at this.\nAnd the data point to the fact\nthat even at our most\nheightened levels of focus,\nmost people can only maintain\nfocus before switching tasks\nfor about three minutes,\nwhich is depressingly\nshort period of time.\nHowever, you can extend\nthat period of time,\nand I've talked about that\nin the episode on focus,\nbut more importantly, when you\nsit down to start a work about\nof any kind, any kind\nexpect that it would take\nabout six minutes for you to\nengage these neural circuits,\nyou wouldn't expect yourself\nto walk into the gym\nand do a PR lift or start\nrunning and do your best sprint,\nor just head out the door\nwithout warming up at all.\nA little walk jog at first,\nor a few warm up sets,\nI mean, we expect that,\nwe are not surprised\nthat we need that.\nAnd yet we sort of expect\nthat our brain should be able\nto lock on and do work in a\nvery focused way immediately.\nAnd that's just a ridiculous assumption,\nit's an unfair assumption, I should say.\nSo assume that it will take\nabout six minutes to engage\nin your work about and that\nthose neurochemical systems\nwill take some time to rev up and engage.\nThe other things that I'm\ndescribing about lighting\nand screen positioning and posture,\nthose will also help maximize your focus\nand will limit that ramp\nup time into a focus state.\nAnd I think what you'll\nfind is that as you maximize\nyour workspace, the time the latency,\nas we say to get into that\nfocus will start to shorten.\nIt will especially start\nto shorten if you use tools\nto limit distraction, we\nwill talk about distraction,\nbut things like Freedom, which is an app,\na free app that allows\nyou to lock yourself\nout of the internet or turning\noff your phone for instance.\nBut even if you're doing work\non your phone or that involves\nyour phone or the internet, as many of us\nincluding myself do, expect\nthere to be a ramp up time\nfor you to focus.\nThere's another aspect of our vision\nthat's absolutely critical\nfor optimizing our workspace.\nAnd that has to do with this\nreally interesting feature\nof our visual pathways in that\nit has two major channels.\nThose two major channels have names,\nalthough you don't have\nto remember the names.\nThe first one is the so-called\nparvocellular channel,\nwhich is involved in looking\nat things at specific points\nin space and at high resolution or detail.\nAnd then there's the so-called\nmagnocellular channel,\nthat's involved in looking\nat big swaths of visual space\nand at lower resolution.\nSo you can think of the\nparvocellular system\nas kind of a high pixel density,\nthink about your most modern smartphone,\nthe recent smartphone with\nthe best, best camera.\nAnd think about the magnocellular system\nas being lower resolution,\nkind of an older smartphone,\nlower pixels, et cetera.\nYou might ask, why would you want a system\nthat's low resolution.\nWell, the low resolution\nsystem is better at things\nlike detecting motion\nand not so much at detail\nand vice versa.\nNow, again, you don't have\nto remember the names,\nwhat you do have to remember, however,\nis that you're going to\ncreate the maximum amount\nof alertness in your system.\nThe maximum amount of ability\nto focus when your system\nis in that parvocellular mode,\nwhen you're bringing your\neyes to a common point,\nwhat we call a vergence eye\nmovement, V-E-R-G-E-N-C-E.\nI've said this before on the\npodcast, and people said,\nvirgin eye movement, no,\nvergence eye movement.\nAs in convergence, bringing your eyes\nto a single point in space,\nwill create a narrower aperture\nof a visual window,\nmeaning your visual world\nactually shrinks at least perceptually.\nWhereas when you relax your\neyes and dilate your gaze,\nyou can do this now by\nwhatever environment you're in,\ntrying and see without moving\nyour head off to the side,\nabove, below you, as broadly as possible,\nmaybe can dilate your gaze\nso much that you can see\nyourself, your body in\nthat visual environment.\nYou'll notice that your\nresolution of vision\nisn't nearly as high as when you do\nthat vergence eye movement.\nVergence eye movements\nare incredibly powerful\nfor creating heightened\nstates of alertness and focus.\nAnd indeed they create\nheightened states of cognition,\nof thinking, and that's because your brain\nfollows your vision in terms of focus.\nWhen we say I can't focus,\nwhat we often are experiencing\nis an ability, and inability, excuse me,\nto not focus visually.\nWhereas when we are in\na very focused state,\nwe are in a state often\nwhere we can focus visually.\nNow we can also do this\nwith our auditory system\nor to touch et cetera, but\nright now we're just talking\nabout the visual system.\nNow, in terms of workspace optimization,\nwhat this means is we never\nreally want to be looking\nat a square or rectangle\nor target area for our work\nthat is too far beyond our ears.\nHow far is too far?\nReally, you want to try\nand keep the blinders on,\nor I should say the invisible blinders\nso that whatever you're looking at falls\nwithin the region of visual\nspace in front of you,\nthat is present if you\nwere to cup your hands\nand put them right next to your eyes.\nNow this is a rough estimation,\nbut I'm doing this now,\nfor those of you that\nare watching on YouTube,\nI'm doing this now, I'm trying\nto simulate like a horse\nwith blinders on, for those\nof you who are listening,\njust imagine me looking\nsilly with my hands\ncupped near my eyes.\nBut if we are to, for\ninstance, look at a screen\nthat's very, very big and\nwe're too close to it,\nor even if we're standing back from it,\nit's going to be hard for\nus to attend to everything\nwithin that screen space.\nSo this is actually support\nfor the idea of using a phone\nor a tablet or a laptop.\nMy laptop is about 15 inches in diameter,\nI think is the one that I\nhave, some are 13, some are 17.\nSome of you like to use big monitors,\nmake sure that whatever it\nis that you're looking at,\nif you want to remain focused,\nit doesn't extend too far\nbeyond where your eyes are,\nthe size of your head that is,\nso just think blinders on a horse.\nAnd actually that's the reason\nthey put blinders on a horse\nso that they're not looking\noff into the periphery.\nHorses, unlike humans don't\nhave the same shaped pupil,\nthey don't have a visual system\nthat's organized in quite the same way,\nthey mostly see in Panorama,\nin magnocellular vision.\nAnd so those blinders are designed\nto keep their visual focus straight ahead,\nso they physically restrict it.\nNow, some people will\nactually go to lengths\nto further restrict their visual focus.\nThey will do things\nlike putting on a hoodie\nor wearing a hat for instance,\nto restrict their visual window.\nAnd indeed that works quite well,\nbut as we'll talk about in a moment\nwhen you really restrict\nyour visual window,\ndown to a very, very narrow\nportion of visual space,\nthat actually changes\nthe types of information\nthat you are best at processing.\nAnd we'll talk about that\nin terms of something\nthat's called the cathedral\neffect in a few moments,\nbut for now here's the principle,\nmake sure that whatever you're looking at\nis directly in front of\nyou and doesn't extend\ntoo far out to the side.\nOnce you get out to say six\nor 12 or certainly 18 inches\non side of your eyes, you\nare dilating your gaze\nby definition, you're dilating your gaze,\nit's completely subconscious,\nand it becomes very hard\nto maintain attention.\nNow, the caveat to this is\nthat if you are going to look\nat a narrow space, a narrow\nwindow for any period of time,\nwhether or not it's a book or a laptop\nor a tablet or a phone,\nthose vergence eye movements\nnot only create alertness,\nbut they also require energy.\nAnd they also can fatigue the\neyes because there's a process\ncalled accommodation whereby\nthe shape of your eye\nliterally has to change\nso that the lens can move\nso that you can focus at that location.\nAccommodation's an incredible process,\nbut it is as demanding\none, and that's the reason\nthat your eyes get tired\nwhen you focus on something\nfor too long.\nSo here's a principle extracted\nfrom the ophthalmology\nand neuroscience literature\nthat you can adopt.\nFor every 45 minutes in which\nyou are focusing on something\nlike a phone or a tablet or\na book page or your computer,\nyou want to get into\nmagnocellular panoramic vision\nfor at least five minutes.\nAnd the way that I suggest\nto do this is actually\nto take a walk, ideally outside.\nWe're going to talk about\nambulation, about movement\nand about how that can maintain alertness\nthroughout the day.\nSo for every 45 minutes or\nso, try and get five minutes\nof relaxing your eyes.\nThis is something that's not often done,\nespecially in today's homeschooling\nand where kids are going to school by Zoom\nand adults are working by Zoom,\nthis is a serious problem.\nPeople are getting eye fatigue,\nthey're getting headaches.\nIndeed, some people are getting migraines,\nthey're having all sorts\nof issues, neck pain.\nMuch of that, if not all\nof that, in some cases\ncan be alleviated by this 45 to five rule.\nFor every 45 minutes of\nfocused work that you do,\nget five minutes where you get outside,\nor if you have to be indoors\nwhere you can dilate your gaze.\nNow some of you may be saying,\nwell, that spits in the\nface of your 90 minute rule.\nYou've told us before that we\nshould focus for 90 minutes.\nI would still want you to take breaks\nwithin those 90 minutes, if\nyou're looking at a narrow piece\nof visual world, meaning at a\nphone or a laptop or so forth,\nand again, the best way to do\nthis would be to go outside,\njust relax your eyes, look\noff into the distance.\nLooking at a horizon will\nautomatically trigger\nthis panoramic gaze, which\nis very relaxing to the eyes\nand will allow you to go back\ninto a focused work about.\nThe one thing you\nabsolutely do not want to do\nis to go outside and check your phone,\nbecause if you're outside\nchecking your phone\nor you're taking a break\nand checking your phone,\nyou're still in that\nvergence eye movement.\nSo this is very, very important\nbecause vergence eye movements\nincrease focus and attention,\nand you can exploit that to increase focus\nand attention when you want\nto, but you absolutely need\nto relax the system,\nagain for every 45 minutes\nin which you've been in that focused mode,\nyou want to get at least five\nminutes of panoramic vision.\nIf you can take a 15\nminute walk, even better.\nNext, I'd like to talk about an aspect\nof workspace optimization\nthat can actually bias\nwhether or not our\nbrain and nervous system\nare better suited for\ndetailed analytic work\nor more abstract work.\nIn fact, there's a way\nthat you can arrange\nyour work environment, or\nI should say there's a way\nthat you can place yourself\ninto certain environments\nthat will allow abstract\nthinking, creative thinking,\nand indeed expansive thinking to emerge.\nThere are other environments\nthat you can put yourself in\nthat will make your brain shift\ntowards more analytic work,\ntoward more detailed and\nprecise types of work.\nNow, I just briefly want to\nmention something that was covered\nagain on the Habits episode\nthat I did a few weeks ago,\nbut again, you don't\nneed to see that episode\nin order to digest this information.\nIt goes back to this issue of three phases\nwithin the circadian 24 hour cycle.\nPhase one, which as I mentioned\nis about zero to eight hours\nafter waking, phase two, nine\nto 16 hours after waking,\nand phase three 17 to\n24 hours after waking.\nPhase one, being ideal\nfor analytic precise,\ndetailed types of work,\nphase two, better suited\nfor most people for creative,\nkind of abstract thinking,\nexpansive thinking,\nbrainstorming, et cetera.\nThere are some exceptions to\nthat, but most people follow\nthat pattern because of the\ndifferent neuromodulators\nand hormones and so\nforth that are released\ninto the brain and body\nat those different phases.\nWhat I'm about to tell you\nis a way in which you can use\nyour physical environment\nto further shift your brain\nand nervous system into a\nmode that's either prime\nfor analytic or abstract\nand creative thinking.\nWhat I'm about to describe is\ncalled the cathedral effect.\nThe cathedral effect has\nbeen discussed well really,\nfor many, many decades,\nmaybe even hundreds of years,\nbut formally has been\ndiscussed since the early 2000s\nin which it seemed that people who were\nin high ceilinged environments,\nhence the phrase cathedral,\nwould shift their thinking and\ntheir ideas to more abstract\nand creative lofty type thinking.\nSo literally higher\nceiling, loftier thinking,\nhigher aspirations that this was observed\nin terms of the language that they use,\nbut also the sorts of ideas\nthat they would generate.\nAnd conversely, that people that were\nin lower ceilinged environments\nwould be more oriented\ntoward using a language\nthat was more restricted,\nliterally more detailed,\nanalytic about things\nin their immediate space.\nNow this seems kind of\nwild on the one hand,\nbut actually if we go\nback to our understanding\nof the neurobiology of the visual system\nand the way that our\nbrain and body is evolved\nin different environments, it\nactually makes a lot of sense.\nWe don't have time to\ngo into a long lecture\nabout evolutionary neurobiology,\nbut we have to remember\nthat our nervous system\nhas a number of features\nthat are adapted to\ndifferent environments.\nAnd indeed, we are able to\ngo from big open prairies\nor mountaintops or large\ncathedrals or concert halls\ninto small environments and\neverything scales with it.\nWhen we're outdoors in\na big, expensive space,\nour vision tends to go long,\nwe tend to be in panoramic,\nmagnocellular vision.\nOur hearing tends to extend long,\neven if we're having a\nconversation with somebody,\nwe tend to also be attending somewhat\nto the screech of hawks\noff in the distance\nor to the rush of a river.\nWhereas when we were in\nsmall spaces, everything,\nour vision, our hearing, and indeed\neven our physical movements\nbecome more restrained.\nEven if we can still extend our\nhands out as far as we want.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nLet's say you're in an elevator,\nthat's a small space compared\nto outside on a field.\nThis has been measured\nover and over again.\nThe size or the amplitude of\npeople's spontaneous movements\nactually scales down in\nsmaller environments,\neven if they aren't completely\nrestricted from extending\ntheir limbs all the way,\nwhereas when we are outdoors,\nwe feel a natural impulse\nto move further away\nfrom our body, our torso with our limbs,\nthis just feels like more\nappropriate behavior.\nAnd when I say appropriate,\nI don't mean in any kind of\nsocial context necessarily.\nThere's actually a reason\nfor this, the visual system\nand the so-called vestibular motor system\nare intimately linked.\nAnd I can just tell you briefly one way\nin which you can test\nthis and observe this\nand even use this, it's a little off topic\nfrom today's episode, but let's say\nyou have a certain amount of flexibility.\nYou can extend your arms off like wings\nis what I'm doing for those\nof you that are listening,\nnot watching off to your\nside with arms straight,\nand you reach a maximum\npositioning of flexibility.\nYou can do a quick experiment\nwhere you sit still,\nyou would bring your arms in for a moment.\nYou can put them on\nyour knees, if you like,\nor in front of you, and\nyou can move your eyes\nvery far off into the\nperiphery of your visual field.\nSo you actually, I'm going to do this now.\nIt looks kind of silly, but moving my eyes\nwithout moving my head\noff into the periphery,\nall the way to the right,\nthen all the way to the left,\nall the way up all the way down,\nbut especially all the way to the left,\nalmost looking over my shoulder\nwithout turning my head\nall the way to my right.\nAnd you will find that you\nactually can extend your arms\nfurther back subsequent to that.\nAnd that's not magic, it\nhas to do with the ways\nin which your cerebellum,\nwhich actually means mini brain\nand your eyes, your visual\nsystem are connected,\nand the way in which\nyour cerebellum controls\nsome of the spindles and other aspects\nof the neuromuscular architecture\nof your nervous system,\n'cause your nerves control your muscles\nand allow those muscles\nto move further out.\nSo for those of you that lack flexibility,\nyou can actually explore\nyour visual system for this.\nNow that's again, a bit of a\ntangent, but it's a fun one\nthat relates back to this\nso-called cathedral effect.\nThe cathedral effect is a\nway in which our thinking\nbecomes more restricted\nand restrained in tighter,\nsmaller, more confined\nvisual environments.\nOr if the ceiling is higher,\nwe are in expansive space\nwith a lot of distance\nabove us or space above us\nand out to the sides,\nmaybe even out on a field,\nour thinking goes into\nthese more broad abstract\nand kind of loftier future\nthinking in particular.\nThis has actually been measured.\nThere's a really nice paper,\nI will post a link to this.\nThe authors are Joan Meyers-Levy and Rui,\nand then in parentheses Juliet Zhu,\nI'm going to assume\nthat they go by Juliet.\nThe title of the paper is \"The\nInfluence of Ceiling Height:\n\"The Effect of Priming\n\"on the Type of Processing People Use.\"\nAnd I won't go into all the details\nof this paper, but what's\nreally cool about this paper\nis they looked with\nvery rigorous statistics\nand they have a fair number of subjects\nand everything about this\npaper looks solid to me.\nThe difference in cognitive processing,\nand abstract thinking and\ndetailed analytic work\nthat people are able to\nperform in environments\nthat have a 10 foot ceiling\nversus an eight foot ceiling,\nwhich is not that much of a difference,\nthere's just two foot difference there.\nAnd what they found\nwere significant effects\nwhereby high ceilings, activate concepts\nrelated to abstraction,\nwhereas low ceilings prime\nconfinement related\nconcepts, but, or promote\nthe kind of detailed thinking\nthat lends itself well\nto sort of spreadsheet type\nwork or accounting type work.\nWhereas abstract creative\nwork was supported\nby these higher ceilings.\nAnd the way they analyze\nthis was really interesting.\nAgain, we don't have time\nto go into all the details,\nbut they ask people to\nsort of generate word sets\nof related to particular\ntopics like sports.\nAnd so people will talk\nabout soccer, football,\nbaseball, golf, et cetera,\nand talk about some of the\nequipment and other things.\nAnd then they had a kind of a challenge,\na cognitive challenge\nwhereby people had to link\ndifferent concepts along\ndifferent dimensions\nso that you depart from\nthe dimension of sport\nand you start thinking about\nsports that involve teams\nor sports that involve a ball, et cetera.\nAnd so in the same conditions you can,\nexcept for the fact that the\nceiling height is different\neight feet or 10 feet, what one finds\nis that the kinds of language\nand the kinds of associations\nthat people start to create\nare vastly different.\nAnd there're actually two\nexperiments in this study,\nyou're welcome to go look at it,\nso it wasn't just about sports,\nthere were some other things\nthat were analyzed as well.\nAnd in the references of this paper,\nit also points to other examples\nof the cathedral effect,\nwhich I find very interesting\nbecause as a vision scientist\nand someone who spends\nhis life thinking about\nand indeed talking about\nthe nervous system,\nwe know that our cognition\nfollows our vision.\nFor low vision or blind\npeople will follow mostly\ntheir hearing and to\nsome extent their touch.\nBut for most people who are sighted,\nas most people are cited,\nour cognition follows\nour visual environment.\nSo what does this mean for\nworkspace optimization?\nWell, most of us have a fixed\nceiling level in our home,\nbut you might have rooms in\nwhich the ceiling is higher\nand rooms in which the ceiling is lower.\nIf that were the case, I\nrecommend if you want to do\ncreative work during phase\ntwo, the nine to 16 hours\nof your circadian cycle,\nnine to 16 hours after waking\nthat is, that you do that\nin the high ceiling room,\nor maybe even outdoors out\non a deck or on a patio.\nCause the highest ceiling\nof courses is the sky.\nWhereas if you're going to\ndo detailed analytic work\nI would suggest doing that\nduring phase one of the day.\nBut even if you're going\nto do it during phase two\nof the day, for whatever\nreason, scheduling\nor other sorts of\nconstraints that you do that\nin the lower ceiling environment.\nNow, if you are interested in controlling\nthe height of your visual world,\nbut you don't have control\nover the ceiling height of the\nenvironment that you're in,\nthere's another way to do that.\nAnd I used to observe this in the cafes,\nin and around Stanford, and the Bay area\nwhere you would see somebody\nwho, despite the weather\nwould be in a hoodie,\nmaybe with a baseball cap\nor other form of hat\nor some sort of blinder\nabove their eyebrows, which\nis actually another way\nof just lowering the ceiling\nheight very, very low\nand restricting your visual field.\nNot unlike blinders that\nwe talked about before\nthat one would put on a horse\nor one would put on themselves\nby restricting their visual angle of focus\nto directly in front of\nthem, but not too far out\nbeyond the sides of their head.\nSo these cathedral effects,\nI think can be leveraged\ntoward doing particular\ntypes of work best.\nAnd again, the lower the ceiling\nor the lower your visual environment,\nthe more that one tends to do\nwhere I should say performs\ndetailed analytic work accurately.\nAnd the more that one's\nthinking is oriented\ntowards detailed sort of\ncorrect answer type work.\nWhereas when the ceiling is\nhigher or there's no ceiling,\nthe more that the brain and\nthe rest of the processing\nthat we call cognitive processing,\nis related to abstract\nreasoning, brainstorming,\nand indeed can pull from broader\nswaths of memory resources,\nbecause really what abstract reasoning is,\nis it's taking the existing\nelements and maneuvering them,\narranging them into novel ways.\nSo you can think about\nlike notes on a piano,\nplaying a particular\nsong, learning scales,\nthat's very analytic.\nThere's a correct answer that\nyou're trying to arrive at\nor generate, whereas writing\nmusic or writing poetry\nor generating new material of any kind,\ninvolves taking existing elements, right?\nYou're not going to use\nwords that you don't have\ncommitted to your memory or\nthat you're not aware of,\nand arranging them in novel ways.\nSo I think the cathedral\neffect can be leveraged.\nAnd again, you don't need to\nmove into a different home\nor build a slanted roof and\nwork at one side of the room\nat one part of the day and\nthe other side of the room\nat the other, although if that's\nthe way you want to swing it,\nthat's great, most of us\ndon't have that flexibility,\nbut it's very clear that\nthe height of the ceiling\nof the visual environment that we're in,\nhas a profound effect on the\ntypes of cognitive processes\nthat we are able to engage.\nNow, I'd like to shift our attention\nto the auditory environment\nor the noise in the room\nor the music in the room or the music\nor noise in the headphones,\nbecause it turns out\nthat there is a lot of quality\nscientific data out there\nthat speaks to whether or not\nlistening to particular sounds\ncan enhance our cognition.\nAnd indeed the answer is yes,\nbut there are very particular\ntypes of things to listen to\nunder very particular types of conditions\nthat allow one to do that.\nFirst off, I want to say\nthat people vary tremendously\nin the extent to which they can tolerate\nbackground noise for work.\nIn fact, individuals will\nvary tremendously from one day\nto the next, or even within the same day\nin the extent to which they\ncan tolerate background noise.\nI've experienced this\nmyself, there been times\nin which I've been working at home\nand I felt like for whatever reason,\nI just could not engage in focus.\nAnd what worked to\ngenerate more focus for me\nwas to go to a cafe or to a library\nor someplace where there's\nactually more commotion,\nmore people moving about,\nmaybe even more noise,\nmaybe even music in the room.\nAnd we have to all be in\ntouch with when we want\nmore background noise, or when we want\nless background noise, there\nis no hard and fast rule.\nIf you look across the literature\nfor studies that involve\ncomplete silence or white noise\nor binaural beats, or music\nor classical music or rock and roll,\nyou can find results to\nsupport any type of environment\nas being more beneficial.\nHowever, as we'll talk about in a moment,\nthere are a few types of\nenvironments to really avoid\nand a few types of sounds\nthat really can enhance\nthe cognition and your ability to focus\nin your workspace\nenvironment across the board,\nthat really seemed to work for all people.\nLet's talk about\nbackground noise to avoid.\nAnd here we're talking about\nbackground noise to avoid\nbecause it actually can cause\nsome pretty severe deficits in cognition.\nThere's a paper first author,\nJordan Love, cool name,\nlast author Alexander Francis.\nThe, the title of the paper has to do\nwith \"Psychophysiological\nresponses to potentially annoying\n\"heating, ventilation and\nair conditioning noise\n\"during mentally demanding\nwork,\" which is a mouthful.\nBut basically what this paper\nidentifies is a large dataset\nin which workplace and\nenvironmental noise,\nmostly the humming of air\nconditioners that's very loud\nor the humming of heaters,\nthat's very loud and ongoing,\njust incessant doesn't let\nup, can really increase\nmental fatigue and can vastly decrease\ncognitive performance. And if\nyou're interested in looking\nat the cognitive performance\ndata that authors\nare Banbury & Berry 2005,\nthat paper is the one\nthat supports the fact that\ncognitive performance is worse\nwhen there's just the\nhum of an air conditioner\nin the background or the hum of a heater\nand otherwise complete silence.\nThere's also evidence which\nI discussed on the episode\nabout hearing, which is\nthat in young children,\nwhite noise can cause some impairments\nin the development of the auditory system.\nNow I don't want parents to\nfreak out and if you're exposed\nto white noise, as it as\na sleep aid as a child,\nwhich I know many of you\nwere, don't freak out,\nbut it turns out that white\nnoise, especially if it's loud,\nwhite noise can cause some\ndisruption in the auditory maps,\nthe representation of\ndifferent frequencies of sound\nin the brain that can lead\nto some deficits in auditory\nand even language processing.\nSo we really have to be careful\nabout long-term exposure,\nextended exposure to white noise,\nor kind of an air conditioning noise\nthat's really at a high level.\nI wouldn't worry if it's in\nthe background and shutting off\nand turning on again, as the\nthermostat kicks off and on,\nbut really try and avoid\nwork in loud fan filled\nor ventilation generating or\nheat generating environments,\nbecause it really can cause damage\nto the auditory system\nlong-term and as we described,\nit can impair cognitive performance\nand overall increase fatigue.\nI think we've all experienced\nthat when you're in a room\nand there's some ongoing background noise\nand all of a sudden it\nstops and you just feel\nthis enormous relief [sighs].\nAnd the reason for this is\nthat our auditory system\nhas a parallel to our visual system.\nIn our visual system, that\nlight entering the eyes\ntriggers the activation\nof those melanopsin cells,\nwhich triggers activation\nof the hypothalamus,\na particular area of the hypothalamus,\nwhich generates alertness,\ngenerates the release,\neven of cortisol, a stress hormone.\nIn the auditory system,\nwhen there's ongoing sound,\nyour auditory system hears that,\neven if you're not paying attention to it,\nif you're paying attention\nto something else,\nit's still registers.\nThose little hair cells, as\nthey're called in your inner ear\nare fluttering, the eardrum is beating\nand in concert to that sound frequency.\nAnd there's a brainstem mechanism\nthat generates alertness\nand a kind of vigilant.\nSo when you have a sound that's\nongoing in the background,\nit shuts off, all of a sudden\nyou experienced that peace,\nwhich is the turning off\nof those brainstem circuits\nthat are associated with\nvigilance, the locus coeruleus,\nwhich we talked about earlier,\nwhich release epinephrin\nand norepinephrine and\ngenerate the heightened state\nof alertness in your brain and body,\nthose neurons then can turn off\nand you experience that as relaxation.\nSo does that mean that we\nshouldn't listen to white noise\nor pink noise or brown\nnoise while we're working?\nCertainly a lot of people do.\nIn fact, if you want to\nknow what white noise,\npink noise and brown noise are,\nthey're just different constellations\nof auditory frequencies\nthat are played together.\nMost of us think of white noise\nas the [shushing] on a screen,\nall the black and white\npixels going all around,\nlike they call it visual\nsnow, but pink noise\nhas certain sound\nfrequencies, notched out,\ntaken out, brown noise has others.\nIt has different frequencies\nthat are included\nat higher amplitude, et cetera.\nYou can look this stuff up on YouTube,\nif you want, you to just put brown noise.\nNone of it sounds terrific,\nit doesn't sound like music.\nIt's literally just\nnoise, mixed frequencies\nin no particular arrangement.\nThere is some evidence\nthat playing white noise\nin the background or on\nheadphones or pink noise\nor brown noise can facilitate cognition,\nbut it's mainly through an increase\nin this overall alertness as a consequence\nof areas like locus coeruleus\nand other brainstem areas\nthat are associated with autonomic arousal\nfrom that noise.\nSo it's a lot like the\nair conditioner effect.\nAnd I think done in a restricted way,\nmeaning not for hours and\nhours, but maybe if your focus\nis waning and you're having\na hard time engaging in work,\nyou might put on some\nbrown noise or white noise\nor pink noise and work that\nway for 45 minutes or so\nbefore you go to your\npanoramic vision walk\nand get some sunlight,\nthat should be fine.\nThere's really no reason\nto suspect, however,\nthat those particular patterns of noise\nare going to optimize\nparticular mental functions.\nSo what I'd like to turn to\nnext are particular patterns\nof sounds that indeed have been shown\nin peer-reviewed studies\nto optimize certain types\nof mental processing, because\nyou can incorporate these\ninto your optimized workspace environment,\nthrough headphones or through speakers,\nwhatever mechanism that you want,\nin order to get more out\nof your work efforts.\nIf you were to search for apps\nor go online and try and find\nsounds that can improve thinking\nor change your emotions.\nYou're generally going\nto find three types.\nOne are called isochronic tones,\nthese are tones usually\nof a common frequency.\nSo it might be a beep and\nthen a pause, and then beep\nof the same frequency, and then beep,\nforgive my terrible beeping.\nI don't know what good\nbeeping would sound like,\nbut contrast isochronic\ntones with monaural beats.\nMonaural beats would be repetitive,\nalmost percussive like beats\ndelivered to just one ear,\n[vocalizing], this kind of thing.\nYou can find apps that can\ndeliver monaural beats,\nyou can find also apps that deliver\nso-called binaural beats.\nYou can also find YouTube\nscripts or channels\nthat will deliver binaural beats.\nBinaural beats as the name suggests,\nare beats delivered to the two ears,\none pattern of kind of\npercussive beat to one ear\nand a different pattern,\nor at least a pattern\nthat's out of phase,\nthat's not synchronized,\ndelivered to the other ear.\nSo on one ear you hear, [vocalizing]\nand in the other ear,\nyou've got [vocalizing].\nAnd what happens is because of the way\nthat the auditory system\nconverges in the brainstem\nand generates what are called\ninteraural time differences,\nI'll explain what that means in a moment,\ninteraural time\ndifferences, the difference\nbetween the two patterns\nof beats that are heard\nby each of the two different\nears, leads to a third pattern\nthat the brain entrains\nto, and kind of maps onto\nand generates particular\ntypes of brainwaves.\nSo without going into a lot of detail,\ninteraural time differences are the ways\nin which if you were to hear\nsomething off to your right,\nlike I just snapped my\nfinger just to the right\nof my right ear, that a\nsignal arrives in my right ear\nbefore that's sound signal,\nthose sound waves arrive\nin my left ear.\nSo there's an interaural\nbetween ears, time difference.\nAnd there's a brainstem area\nin which signals from one ear\nand signals from the other ear converge,\nand there's literally a math\ndone by your nervous system\nthat says this signal arrived\nbefore the other signal.\nAnd the difference between those signals\nis the interaural time difference.\nSo if I were to snap my\nfingers on both sides\non my left and on my right\nside of the exact same time,\nand they arrive at the same time,\nthe interaural time difference is zero.\nWhereas if one goes first on\nthe right and then the left,\nI'm terrible at snapping on\nthe left, it's a weak snap,\nbut it was there, then there's a delay\nand the interaural time\ndifference has a particular value.\nOkay, you get it, it's\nalmost ridiculously simple.\nBinaural beats have been generated in ways\nthat create a particular pattern\nof interaural time\ndifferences that then cascades\nup to the rest of the brain\nand puts the forebrain\nand other areas of the brain\nthat are involved in cognition\nand action into a particular rhythm.\nAnd some of the rhythms or\nwaves of brain activity are ones\nthat you may have heard\nof, things like alpha waves\nor theta waves or gamma waves.\nNow I don't like to get too attached\nto particular brain waves as excellent\nfor particular kinds of thinking.\nThis is something that was really popular\nin the 90s and 2000s, when ways\nof measuring brain activity,\nnoninvasively with\nelectrodes on the outside,\nenabled people to identify\nthe indeed alpha brain waves\nare associated with alertness states.\nAnd some are other brainwaves\nthat are kind of larger amplitudes,\nslow waves like delta waves are associated\nwith kind of sleepiness or\nrelaxation, but in general,\nthe way that the brain works\nis that different brain waves\nare generated in different\nstructures at different times.\nAnd those combine to give us a\nsense of happiness or give us\na sense of focus or give\nus a sense of creativity.\nNonetheless, if you look\nacross the board at the studies\nof binaural beats and you ask\nwhat sorts of binaural beats\nappear to be useful for people to enhance\ntheir brain function for\nparticular kinds of tasks,\nwe arrive at some very\ninteresting answers.\nSo we'll review what those are now.\nThe frequency of binaural beats\nthat appears to bring about\nimproved cognitive functioning\nat the level of memory,\nimproved reaction times\nand improved verbal recall,\nseems to be 40 Hertz.\nNow, is it exactly 40 Hertz?\nWe don't know, but if one wants to look up\na great reference on this,\nthey reference Colzato,\nC-O-L-Z-A-T-O et al 2017\ndescribes and here, I'm quoting,\nso this is a direct quote.\n\"The present findings are in line\n\"with those of a recent\nstudy, which also found\n\"faster reaction times in participants\n\"that listen to binaural\nbeats at 40 Hertz.\"\nAnd you can find many examples\nof this in the literature\nwhere binaural beats have about 40 Hertz\nor exactly 40 Hertz, in some cases,\nsomehow brought the brain into\na state that made it optimal\nfor learning, for memory and\nfor certain types of recall,\nincluding verbal recall,\nmath learning, et cetera.\nSo for those of you that are\ninterested in binaural beats,\nthere are a number of free apps out there.\nI'm not going to recommend\nany in particular,\njust have to search for one\nthat you happen to like.\nOne thing that you will find\nis that many of those apps\nsuper-imposed binaural beats\nonto raindrops or ocean sounds\nor that rather they superimpose\nocean sounds and raindrops\nonto the binaural beats,\nthat does not appear\nto be as effective as pure binaural beats.\nThere has been an exploration\nof lower frequency binaural beats.\nSo for instance, seven Hertz,\nwhich is theta binaural beats\ndone for 30 minutes with\nan overlay of rain sound\nor rain sounds only that's been analyzed\nand believe it or not, that\nshowed immediate recall memory\nwas significantly decreased.\nSo that's a negative effect\nof binaural beats on memory.\nSo the idea that binaural\nbeats are just great for us\nacross the board, I think is wrong.\nIt does appear that the higher\nfrequency binaural beats\nas one moves up toward 40 Hertz\nare going to be the most beneficial.\nThere are instances in which for instance,\n15 Hertz binaural beats\nincreased response accuracy\non a spatial verbal memory task.\nThis is a complicated working memory task.\nWorking memory is the kind of memory\nof remembering a phone number.\nSo if I say for instance, 4932931,\nand you have to remember that number,\nkeeping it online is what\nwe call your working memory.\nIt's likely that you would forget that\ntwo or three days later.\nYou can get improvements in working memory\nwith 15 Hertz binaural beats,\nwhereas the other control conditions,\nfive Hertz and 10 Hertz binaural beats,\nall decreased accuracy of working memory.\nHowever, when I looked at the literature\nand I examined a number\nof different studies,\nwhat I always seem to come\nback to was that 40 Hertz or so\nplus or minus five Hertz\nseemed to be optimal\nfor generating improvements in cognition,\nin math performance, and\neven in various types\nof memory recall, and even\nin musical performance.\nYou might wonder, well, how can people do\nmusical performance, they're\nlistening to binaural beats.\nHere's another surprise,\nmany of the studies\nthat I looked at didn't\nhave people listening\nto binaural beats while\nthey were doing the tasks,\nthe memory task, or the\nmusic learning, et cetera,\nthey would do it\nbeforehand for 30 minutes.\nThere were instances in\nwhich people were listening\nto binaural beats during the task.\nBut if you decide to\nemploy binaural beats,\nI recommend this 40 Hertz\nas a great place to start.\nI don't recommend doing it\nfor all of your work bouts.\nI think there's a good reason to believe\nthat you can attenuate to it.\nBut if you are going to try\nit, you might try it both ways.\nYou might try listening to binaural beats\nfor about 30 minutes\nwhile doing something else\nand then maybe eating lunch\nor something of that sort,\nor taking a walk and then\ngoing into the work about.\nBecause remember the moment\nthat you start listening\nto these binaural beats, the\nbrain doesn't immediately\nswitch into a particular\npattern of oscillation\nor brain waves, it takes some time.\nNeural circuits, again,\ntake time to engage.\nThe only neural circuits that\nare going to engage instantly\nare going be the ones that are\nof a sort of reflexive sort,\nlike you step on a sharp object\nand you have to retract your limb,\nor you suddenly are stressed\nby a distressing text message,\nor you're suddenly delighted\nabout a delightful text message.\nBut when it comes to shifting\nyour whole brain state\ntoward optimizing work, it\ntakes a little bit of time.\nSo again, 40 Hertz binaural\nbeats, many, many apps,\nmany YouTube scripts out\nthere, probably other resources\nfor binaural beats, hopefully zero cost,\nso you can access those without any need\nto shell out any money.\nIf you find one that\nyou particularly like,\nmaybe put in the comment section,\nso other people can find it,\nYouTube would be the\nbest place to do that.\nFeel free to put a link\nor just a description,\nthat will be wonderful.\nAnd again, you don't need\nto listen to binaural beats\nat the exact same time\nthat you're doing the work,\nalthough that could also\nenhance your productivity.\nSome of you out there might be craving\na little bit more mechanism\nby which binaural beats\ncan influence things like\nfocus or reduced reaction time.\nThis has actually been explored,\nthis 40 Hertz binaural beats\npattern seems to have an effect\non what's called striatal dopamine.\nWe have dopamine as a\nneuromodulator of course,\ninvolved in many things in motivation,\nit's actually involved in\nadaptation to light in the retina.\nSomething that most people don't know,\nbut it's involved in\nmovement, which is why people\nwith Parkinson's who have a\ndepletion of dopamine neurons\nactually have movement deficits and so on.\nBut striatal dopamine is closely related\nto motivation and focus.\nAnd 40 Hertz binaural\nbeats appears to increase\nstriatal dopamine release.\nAnd this has actually\nbeen measured indirectly\nby what we call spontaneous blink rate.\nNow I've been accused on\nvarious Instagram posts,\nand even on this podcast\nof being a non-blinker,\nlet's call it, or a minimal blinker.\nAnd as an important aside,\nthere is no evidence whatsoever\nthat people that don't blink very much\nare sociopaths or lie.\nAlso, you will hear that\npeople who blink a lot\nare sociopaths and are lying.\nThere's absolutely no\nevidence that blink frequency\ncorrelates with anything except alertness.\nNow longer blinks are\nassociated with less alertness.\nAs we get tired, we tend\nto blink longer and longer\nuntil we take the long\nblink that is sleep.\nI guess the long blink would be death,\nbut the longish blink would be sleep.\nBut it turns out that the more\nfiring of striatal dopamine\nneurons that's occurring,\nthe more frequently we blink.\nAnd so it is associated with a resetting\nof our visual window, that's\nwhat happens when we blink\nand there's a whole\nrelationship between blinking\nand time perception that we covered\nin the episode on time perception.\nBut here's the bottom line\nfor sake of this discussion.\n40 Hertz binaural beats\nappears to increase\nspontaneous blink rates\nbecause it increases\ndopamine transmission in the\nbrainstem and in the striatum\nin several locations in fact.\nAnd so the way in which\nthese binaural beats\nset a rhythm in the brain,\nrecruits dopamine release.\nThat dopamine release\nleads to heightened levels\nof motivation and focus,\nwhy motivation and focus?\nWell, dopamine is actually the substrate\nby which epinephrin is made.\nDopamine, the molecule is\nactually converted into epinephrin\nadrenaline and they work\ntogether like close cousins,\ndopamine and epinephrin in\norder to put us on a path\nof movement or if we are doing work,\nof mental movement toward a goal.\nSo that's a little bit of\nmechanistic meat to explain\nat least part of the reason\nwhy 40 Hertz binaural beats\ncan enhance our focus,\nreduce our reaction times\nand improve indeed learning and memory.\nNext I'd like to talk\nabout the role of movement\nin optimizing our workspace\nand whether or not standing,\nsitting, lying down, treadmilling\nor even believe it or not,\ncycling, can enhance our\nwork output and performance.\nBefore we do that, I want\nto touch on two aspects\nof optimizing workspace that\nwill come up at some point\nin your work or school life.\nAlas, there isn't a lot\nof science around this,\nbut I think they are worth mentioning.\nAnd I think I can offer\na little bit of advice\nin terms of how to navigate these\nin a way that would be beneficial to you.\nThe first one is interruptions.\nIf you go online and you ask\nabout how to avoid\ninterruptions, people will say,\nokay, well, if you have kids\nat home or even if you don't\nor at work, you'll have a\nlight, like a recording light\nwith recording is on\nwe're, we're busy now,\nor have a sign on the door that says\nbother only in a case of emergency\nor find to knock or don't knock at all.\nI've used a different\npolicy throughout the years.\nI am somebody who works\npretty hard to control my time\nand focus, but of course,\nas a laboratory director,\nI have people coming by and\nwho want to talk about things.\nAnd of course we have\nphones and we have computers\nand people's opportunity to reach us.\nInterruptions really are deadly\nto our ability to generate focus.\nAnd it's not just about\nthe distraction that occurs\nof say a minute or two\nminutes or five minutes\nwhen we were interrupted,\nit's also about the additional time\nto get those brain circuits to\nre-engage to a mode of focus.\nSo it's really kind of a double whammy.\nNow, none of us, including\nmyself want to be harsh\nor cruel or shut off from the world\nand oftentimes interruptions\nbring incredible insights\nand people are providing\nsupport and very useful things\nthat are essential to my\nworkday and presumably\nto your workday in school day as well.\nBut there's a simple method that I learned\nfrom my graduate advisor\nthat works very, very well.\nAgain, no peer review data to support it,\nthis is just my experience,\nbut this is somebody\nwho had immense powers of focus,\nhad a very, very demanding life,\na long commute to children,\nextensive laboratory, et cetera.\nAnd what she would do was if I\ncame by and asked a question,\nor if anyone came by and asked a question,\nshe would acknowledge their presence,\nbut would not shift her body toward them.\nSo she purposely did not\nposition her computer\nfacing the door, which I think\nis a deadly or I should say,\ndeadly to focus a way of\npositioning your workspace.\nSo her computer was facing the wall,\nthe door was perpendicular to that.\nAnd I would come by and\nI say, I have a question.\nShe would say yes, so she\nwould acknowledge my presence,\nbut she wouldn't actually\norient her body toward me,\nwhich told me that this conversation\nwas not going to last very long.\nAnd no matter how long I\nstood there or what I asked,\nshe would never orient toward me,\nwhich generally kept these\nconversations very, very short.\nWe had other designated meetings\nwhere we would be face-to-face.\nThe other approach, which I confess\ncolleagues of mine have used before,\nnot necessarily at Stanford,\nbut elsewhere is to simply say\nno to everything that\nsomebody requests or comes by.\nSo if someone would knock on the door,\nthey would just shout no through the door,\nor if someone said, can I\nbother you for a second?\nThey would say, no, or if someone said,\nI have something I want to tell\nyou, they would just say no.\nAnd they would just continue doing this\nuntil the person went away.\nThat was actually very effective,\nthese were some of the most\nproductive people I know,\nnot always the kindest, but\nsome of them were very kind.\nThe other approach that I've seen\nand actually this is an approach\nthat was used by someone\nwho has been a guest on\nThe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nsomeone who's immensely\nproductive was that he,\nso I'm constraining who\nthis might be by saying he,\nhe actually, despite having the option\nto have a very large\noffice, would place himself\nin a workspace that was\nliterally a coat closet,\ncleared out with a desk,\nsmall lamp, completely dark.\nSo this violates everything\nthat I've talked about before\nor prior to this, everything\nabout high ceilings,\nbright light, et cetera, and would work,\nstill works underneath a desk lamp\nin a completely dark\ncloset, minimal ventilation.\nThis is my definition of hell.\nAnd yet is one of the most\nproductive people on the planet.\nAlso very, very hard to\nfind, I actually know\nwhere his closet is, turns\nout he has several of them\nthat he migrates from in\norder to avoid distractions.\nSo I mentioned these as kind of extremes,\nI think that most of us\nexist on the other extreme.\nAnd that's why I mentioned\nit, which is that most of us\nlike some social engagement and a welcome,\nor at least set our work environment\nin a way that welcomes interruption\nand we have to be very,\nvery careful about this.\nNow in the digital realm,\nI already mentioned\na few of the things that we\ncan do as practical tools\nto limit interruptions.\nOne is use the program Freedom,\nthe other would be to\nsimply turn off the wifi.\nIf you do need to be\nonline and navigating,\nyou're doing research of any kind,\nthat's not going to be possible.\nTurning off one's phone, I've at times,\nput my phone on airplane\nmode, if that didn't work,\nI've locked it in a safe, I've done that,\nI'd left in the car outside.\nIt all depends on one's\nlevels of self-discipline,\nwhich as you probably know,\nfrom your own experience,\ntends to kind of wax and wane.\nSometimes we are better\nat avoiding these\ndistractions than others.\nSo if you find yourself in\na place where it's very hard\nto reduce those distractions,\nyou may need you to go\nto more elaborate lanes.\nI will say that a\ngraduate student in my lab\nwho was immensely productive and focused,\nhad the habit of coming in each day,\nshe would take her phone, I\ndon't know if she turned it on,\nor off or not, and she would\njust place it in a door,\nexcuse me, in a drawer\nand would then go start doing experiments.\nWe do experiments all day at 10 courses,\nengage in discussions\navidly with the rest of us,\nand then would take her phone out\nat the end of the day and leave.\nAnd I don't think that\nbehavior was not correlated\nwith her immense productivity.\nI think the ability to untether\nourselves from the phone\nis going to be the way in which many of us\nare either going to succeed or\nfail in our various pursuits.\nI'm somebody who engages on with the phone\non a regular basis throughout\nthe day for various reasons,\nbut I do try and have\nlarge swaths of the day\nin which it's either on airplane mode\nor it's completely\nphysically separated from me.\nWhen I'm in large swaths,\nI might do every other hour\nwith the phone on airplane mode\nor even a two or three hour\nabout where I just am simply\nnot engaged with the phone at all.\nSo is it better to sit\nor is it better to stand\nwhen doing work, at least as it relates\nto focus and productivity?\nAnd the answer is both.\nThere've been a number\nof systematic studies\nexploring what are called sit-stand desks.\nSo these are desks that\ncan be set to a height\nthat makes standing the best practice,\nand then they can be lowered to a height\nthat makes sitting the best practice\nor the easiest practice I should say.\nAnd it turns out that just\nsitting is terrible for us\nand there's an enormous\nnumber of studies out there\nthat have pointed the\nfact that people who sit\nfor five or six or seven\nhours a day doing work,\nhave all sorts of issues\nrelated to sleep, neck pain,\ncognition suffers, their number\nof cardiovascular effects,\neven digestion, there may even actually be\nsome almost pressure\neffects on the pelvic floor\nand things of that sort,\ndepending on the chairs\nthat one uses.\nBut that people who stand are\nin a slightly better situation\nwhere many of those\nhealth metrics improve,\nbut that people that do\na combination of sitting\nand standing at the same\ndesk throughout the day,\nor move from one desk to another,\nif they don't have a\ncombination sit-stand desk,\nthat's going to be best.\nThe good news is it's very\neasy to convert a sit desk\ninto a stand desk, you\ncan just stack some boxes,\nI've done this at times or stack books.\nThere are also some pedestals\nand things that you can purchase\nif that's your preference\nin order to set your computer\nat a particular height.\nAnd of course there are\ndesks that have motors\nand they're ones that have cranks,\nand there are all sorts of variations,\nboth in terms of the\ntypes and whether or not\nthey have motors as well as\nthe cost to these things.\nSo they can go from very\nlow cost, like placing boxes\nor books to create a standing desk,\nto very high cost in some cases.\nNow what's interesting,\nif you look at a scientific literature,\nis that people who\ndecreased their sitting time\nby about half each day.\nSo they took, let's say they were working\nfor seven hours a day, three\nand a half hours of that day,\nthey decide to stand,\nand it's not even clear\nthat it matters that they\ndo all those three hours\nin one about, or they divide that up\ninto shorter bouts of a half an hour,\nand then sit for half an hour, et cetera,\nalternating back and forth\nshowed incredibly significant\neffects on reduced neck and shoulder pain,\nincrease in subjective health,\nvitality in a work-related environments.\nAnd perhaps most importantly,\nfor sake of today's discussion\nimprovement in cognitive conditioning\nand the ability to embrace new tasks\nand cognitive performance.\nThere are several studies\nthat if one wanted to explore,\nthey could explore this in more detail.\nI'll put a link to this as well.\nThe article that I'm referring to\nis called \"Effects of a Workplace\n\"Sit-Stand Desk Intervention\non Health and Productivity.\"\nAnd I like this paper because\nmany of the papers out there\nfocus on the effects of\nsit-stand desks on health\nin trying to get people\nto burn more calories,\nimprove their posture, relieve neck pain,\nslumped over, et cetera,\nbut not on productivity.\nAnd this particular paper focuses\nalso on the metrics of productivity,\nit has its own study and also references\na number of important studies.\nWhat does this mean for you and me?\nWell, I've long used a standing desk\nor some variation thereof.\nWhat this means is that\nwe should probably spend\nabout half of our work time standing\nand about half of it sitting,\nbut not all sitting or not all standing.\nIf you had to do all one or the other,\nstanding is going to\nbe better than sitting.\nWhat happens if we just stand?\nWell, that can also generate\nsome postural issues\nin terms of stabilization and fatigue.\nI have a good friend who's in the movement\nand physical rehabilitation\nand physiology space,\nhis name is Kelly Starrett,\nhe's very impressive\nin all those domains, and he always says,\nwe weren't designed to sit all day,\nbut we also weren't\ndesigned to stand all day.\nAnd I think that's true,\nif we were to look back\nat our species over tens or\nhundreds of thousands of years,\nwe would find that indeed, we\ndid sit down, we did lie down.\nIt wasn't that we were\nstanding all day long.\nThat said, almost everybody,\nat least in the U.S.,\nis not getting sufficient\ncardiovascular exercise\nor movement throughout the day.\nAnd standing at one's desk can improve\nsome of those health metrics, and again,\ncan improve productivity,\nprobably because of those\npostural effects that\nI talked about earlier,\nthat when we lie down, there\ntends to be less alertness\nin our brainstem, if you will\nand there's less activation\nof those brainstem circuits\ninvolved in alertness.\nAnd indeed that circuits that involve\na kind of a calming effect\non the body, get activated.\nAnd as we become upright,\nstanding or sitting,\nbut especially standing,\nthen those brainstem circuits\nfor alertness kick on, which\nare going to make it easier\nto remain focused.\nIf you are going to start standing\nfor half of your work time,\nyou will notice that it\ntakes a few days to adapt.\nYou'll notice a lot of\nshifting from side to side,\ndefinitely want to wear comfortable shoes.\nSome people do this on a wooden floor,\nother people feel uncomfortable\nunless they're on carpet.\nYou have to figure out what works for you,\nbut it can take a little\nbit of time to adapt.\nAfter say after now,\nabout 10 years of working\nat a sit-stand desk, I find\nI can't sit for too long\nbefore I want to stand.\nAnd my standing bouts can\nbe anywhere from 30 minutes\nto two hours, although two hours\nwould be a little bit long.\nAnd then I catch myself\nkind of leaning on the desk\noff to the side.\nSo again, the idea is to stand,\nbut not be leaning on the desk,\nobviously, if you're\ntyping or you're writing,\nthere'll be some leaning involved,\nbut that's what the literature support.\nThere is also a literature\non whether or not\nphysical movement under your\ndesk, meaning treadmilling\nor in fact, there are now bicycles\nthat allow people to peddle.\nIt's kind of a unicycle like thing,\nalthough not a unicycle under the desk,\ncan be beneficial for\nworkplace performance.\nSo let's take a look\nat what those data say.\nThe study that I'm referring\nto has a first author,\nFrod Sham, F-R-O-D\nS-H-A-M, Frod Sham et al.\nThis is a research article\npublished in plus one,\nand the title of the article is,\n\"Does Type of Active Workstation Matter:\n\"A Randomized Comparison of\nCognitive and Typing Performance\n\"Between Rest, Cycling and\nTreadmill, Active Workstation.\"\nIt's amazing that people do this science,\nI think it's great.\nWhere else would we get peer-reviewed data\non these types of questions?\nFirst things first, there were\nno significant differences\nbetween cycling or treadmill workstations\non any cognitive or typing outcomes.\nSo it does not seem to\nmatter whether or not people\nare treadmilling under the desk.\nSo these would be stationary treadmills,\nit's like a little conveyor\nthat people are walking on.\nSometimes very slowly,\nI'm guessing some people\nwalk more quickly, the New Yorkers\nprobably treadmill quicker.\nThe California's probably\ntreadmill a little slower,\nI'm in Californian, so I can\nmake that quote unquote joke,\nbut nonetheless, there were\nno significant differences\nbetween that and a cycling\nstation where people are sitting\nand peddling as they type\naway or as they work,\nor as they're on phone calls, et cetera.\nSo it really doesn't seem to matter.\nSo if you're going to embrace\nthese active workstations,\nas they're called, just decide\nwhat you would prefer to use.\nIt doesn't seem to matter\nin terms of outcomes.\nNow, this study involved\nlooking at 137 young adults.\nThey had multiple sessions\nwhere they at first completed\ncognitive and typing tests,\nthese tests have different\nnames, and you're welcome\nto look those up if you like,\nas well as flanker tasks,\nso these are tasks of attention\nand things of that sort.\nAnd then they either engaged\nin treadmill or cycling\nand then there was a comparison.\nAnd the statistics were run,\nand basically what they found\nwas there was a statistically\nsignificant improvement\nin attention and cognitive control scores\nduring any kind of active session,\nas opposed to just a mere seated session.\nSo they compared seated to\ncycling to treadmilling.\nHowever, verbal memory\nscores actually got worse\nduring active sessions.\nSo I'll repeat that, treadmilling\nor the cycling workstations,\nimproved attention\nand cognitive control\nscores as compared to people\nthat were just seated and working.\nHowever, verbal memory scores got worse\nduring the active sessions,\nand again, just to repeat,\nthere was no difference between cycling\nand treadmill workstations.\nSo this is interesting, I\nsuggest that as the author say\nthat active workstations,\nwhether walking or cycling\nare not only useful to\nimprove caloric output\nand physical activity,\ncirculation and so on,\nbut particularly when completing\ntasks like cognitive tasks\nor tasks that require\nfocus that do not require\nverbal memory recall.\nNow why verbal memory recall\nwas negatively impacted,\nwe don't know, it could be\nbecause people were breathing\na little bit harder.\nIt could be that there's\nsomething about walking\nand talking that seems\nincompatible in the nervous system,\nalthough I'm not aware of that.\nI know a number of people\nwho can walk and talk\nat the same time, but if\nyou are going to explore\nthese treadmills or\nyou're going to explore\nthese cycling stations,\nyou probably wouldn't want\nto do that for highly verbal work,\nmaybe more for mathematical\nwork or for analytic work\nor even creative work.\nBut anything that involves\nvery precise or detailed\nverbal recall, sitting or standing\nseems to be the better option.\nAnd if you're wondering\nwhy cycling or treadmilling\nwould enhance various\naspects of cognition,\nwe can speculate.\nI've talked before about this,\nbut anytime we are generating\nforward movement through our\nown actions, our own efforts,\ntypically, if we are outside,\nwe're not on a treadmill\nor we're out on a bicycle or running,\nor even on a motorcycle or in a car,\nwe have what's called optic flow.\nAnd that optic flow is\nknown to quiet certain areas\nof the brain that are\nassociated with vigilance\nand indeed fear.\nThis is the basis of things like EMDR,\neye movement desensitization reprocessing.\nHowever, the mere act of\nengaging what are called\nour central pattern generators,\nthe neurons in our brain\nstem and in our spinal cord\nthat engage repetitive\nmovements also can reduce\nsome of the areas of the\nbrain that are associated\nwith anxiety and vigilance.\nSo one pure speculation, but nonetheless\ngrounded speculation\nwould be that treadmilling\nor cycling at a desk would reduce anxiety\nthat would allow performance to improve.\nThe other, what I think\nis more likely explanation\nis that anytime we are in ambulation,\nwe recruit the release of\nneuromodulators like epinephrin\ndopamine and things of that\nsort, that further increase\noverall levels of alertness.\nI think that's the more likely explanation\nbecause it's hard to imagine\nhow just a reduction in anxiety\ncould lead to these\nimprovements in cognition\nin a direct way.\nWhereas the subjects in\nthe study, I just mentioned\non average experienced an increase\nin cognitive performance\nmerely by movement.\nAnd this does not include any optic flow\nbecause it's stationary,\nthe treadmill or the cycle is stationary.\nAnd so we can rule out that optic flow,\nand that points to the idea\nthat when we are in movement,\nwe recruit neuromodulators\nassociated with the so-called\nreticular activating system,\nthe striatal system and so forth,\nthat would place the\nbrain into some pattern.\nWe don't know, we only can\nspeculate some pattern,\nperhaps it's gamma waves\nor some other wave pattern\nthat would engage heightened\nlevels of focus and attention.\nNonetheless, treadmilling,\ncycling at a desk,\ndoes improve cognition.\nSo we've been discussing\nworkspace optimization\nwith the understanding that\nyou're not always going to work\nin the same place every day.\nWhat I've tried to do is give you a set\nof high potency tools that\ncan improve your focus\nand cognition, and to place\nthat within a framework\nfor particular kinds of work.\nLet's just review some\nof the basic elements\nof what we've covered today.\nFirst of all, in the\nfirst part of your day,\nthat zero to nine hours after waking,\nyou want bright lights,\nespecially overhead lights,\nas bright as you can keep them\nwithout feeling uncomfortable,\nor certainly not without\nfeeling any pain in your eyes\nor elsewhere in your body.\nBright lights will make for\nthe maximum state of alertness.\nIn addition, try and place, whatever it is\nthat you're focusing on\ndirectly in front of you,\nbut not have it extend too far out\nto either side of your\neyes, try and generate\na fairly restricted visual\nwindow as we call it.\nAnd if you can, try and\nplace whatever it is\nyou're focusing on at least\nat nose level or above,\nthat it might take some\nengineering or some ingenuity\nand creativity in order to\nfigure out how to do that,\nbut that's going to be most beneficial.\nTry and avoid reclining,\ntry and avoid sitting,\ntry and stand for at least\nhalf of your work day.\nThat's a good goal, and\nit may take some time\nto work up to that goal.\nIn addition, if you're going to use sound\nas a stimulus for increasing\nfocus and alertness,\ntrying to avoid exposure\nto white noise, pink noise\nor brown noise for\nextended periods of time,\nfor more than an hour or so,\nthat might actually be damaging\nto the auditory system.\nAnd at the very least,\nis kind of stressful,\neven though you might not notice it,\nit's kind of a background\nlevel of anxiety and stress\nthat is not going to serve you well.\nRather, if you're going\nto pursue particular types\nof sound frequencies consider\nusing 40 Hertz binaural beats,\nnot monaural beats, but\n40 Hertz binaural beats\ndone during a particular\nwork about or for 30 minutes\nprior to that work about.\nI would not rely on binaural\nbeats all the time, every day,\nI think that could cause\nthem to lose their potency,\njust because of the way the\nauditory system attenuates.\nAnd actually you've\nexperienced that attenuation,\nthe mere fact that you\ncan go into an environment\nwhere there's an air conditioner,\nblowing, blowing, blowing,\nand then it stops, and\nyou feel that relaxation,\nbut you weren't thinking about\nthe air conditioner before,\nit tells you that your auditory system\nhad kind of attenuated to it\nand yet it was still\nimpacting your system.\nYou were sensing it, we would\nsay, but not perceiving it.\nThere are other things that you can do\nto improve your workspace optimization\nsuch as standing for half the\nday, as I mentioned before,\nbut if you're interested in this\nor you feel like it\nsuits you to treadmill,\nfind a stationary treadmill\nthat you can walk on.\nI've never tried this before,\nmaybe after this episode,\ngiven what I've read in\nthe peer-reviewed research,\nand it's pretty compelling,\nthat treadmilling seems\nlike an interesting way\nto increase alertness\nand cognitive performance.\nI'm not sure that I would\ndo the cycling method\nbecause I can't imagine just cycling\nand typing at the same\ntime, that sort feels like,\nlike I actually can do the rub here,\ntell me pat your head kind of thing.\nBut it still feels like a little bit\nof a sort of a cognitive\nmotor collision for me\nfor whatever reason,\nbut that's just my bias.\nI do know how to ride\na bicycle, but anyway,\nyou pick your preference.\nSome other things that you could do\nin order to improve your\nworkplace performance\nwould be to consider the cathedral effect.\nIf you're going to do analytic\nwork for any part of the day,\nphase one or phase two,\nas I described them,\nbut really in any time of day,\nthat detailed analytic work\nfor which there is a correct answer,\nlearning scales of music,\nlearning mathematics,\ntrying to figure out the\nsolution to a problem\nwhere there is indeed a solution.\nIt could be an interpersonal\nproblem as well,\nthen try and get into an environment\nwith a relatively low ceiling.\nIf you don't have access to\na low ceiling environment,\nyou might consider using a\nbrimmed hat or even a hoodie,\nor even just facing down,\nor even putting your hand\nabove your eyes, as you will,\nat the level of your eyebrows.\nIn other words, lower the\nceiling, that's the basis\nof the cathedral effects\non analytic performance.\nIn contrast, if you're interested\nin doing brainstorming,\ncreative work, you're writing new things,\nyou're creating new things\nof any kind, artwork,\nconsider getting into a high ceiling\nor no ceiling environment,\nor if you're wearing\na brimmed hat or you're wearing a hoodie,\nmaybe peel that back.\nAgain, the data within the\npeer reviewed literature\nare there to support\nthese sorts of practices.\nAnd if you'd like to start\nlayering these protocols,\nby all means, please do that.\nThere's no reason why you couldn't do one\nor just two of these protocols.\nThere's no reason why, for instance,\nyou couldn't use binaural\nbeats and try and get\ninto a low ceiling environment\nto do detailed work\na couple times a week,\nbut you could also employ all of these.\nNow, of course, there are an\nenormous number of other things\nthat you can do to\nimprove work performance\nand productivity, and\nI've talked about those\nin previous episodes, in particular,\nin the episode on focus and\nthe episode on motivation,\nthere are supplements you can take\nthat can increase dopamine, for instance.\nThere are tools that you can\nuse to increase your focus,\nfor instance, focusing\nyour visual attention\non one location for 30 to 60 seconds\nprior to entering a focused work about,\nthis has been shown again and again.\nThe work from Emily Bell, that's at NYU\nin the episode on focus, I\ncited a number of studies\nwhere this has actually been tested\nand deployed in various schools.\nHaving kids do a focus\ntask where they look\nat a particular visual\ntarget for 30 to 60 seconds,\nthen doing some mathematics and seeing\npretty impressive improvement\nin focus and attention,\neven in people that\nhave attention deficit,\nhyperactivity disorder and so on.\nSo there's no reason why you\ncan't and shouldn't combine\nthe sort of practical workspace\noptimization solutions\nthat we talked about today with the kind\nof neural optimization\nsolutions that we talked about\nin the episode on focus\nand the episode on ADHD\nand the episode on motivation.\nBy all means, layer those together,\nthat's how you're going to\nachieve the optimal focus bouts,\nthat's how you're going to achieve\nthe optimal creativity bouts.\nI do want to acknowledge\nagain, the fact that I realized\npeople are showing up to this challenge\nof workspace optimization\nwith different budgets,\nwith different constraints.\nSome people have kids at home,\nthere are a lot of interruption,\nsome people do not.\nNonetheless, I hope that the information\nI was able to provide today will allow you\nto make subtle or maybe\neven drastic rearrangements\nin your workspace environment.\nThere's one other point related to that,\nthat I did not cover and\nthat I'd like to cover\njust briefly, which is\nthat there's nothing to say\nthat you have to always\nwork in the same location\nall the time.\nYou can move from house to\ncafe if that works for you,\nyou can move from office to home,\nyou can also move from different\nlocations within your home.\nI have a brief anecdote about this.\nI used to attend a lot\nof scientific meetings\nwhen a lot of scientific\nmeetings were in person,\nand there were always a few individuals\nthat seem to stay engaged\nthroughout these very long meetings.\nAnd we're talking seven, eight hour day,\nsometimes evening sessions,\nand sometimes these meetings\nwould go on for, four or\nfive or even six days.\nThese are long meetings\nand the quality of talks\nvary tremendously, and I\nalways notice the individuals\nthat manage to stay engaged and awake\nfor the entire meeting.\nAnd I noticed that people\nthat could maintain\nhigh levels of alertness\nin this one conference room\nhad a habit of moving to a different seat\nafter each session,\nsometimes even between talks.\nAnd I actually discussed this\nwith one of my colleagues\nwho was doing this, I\nsaid, is this conscious,\nare you always moving from place to place?\nAnd he said, yeah, if I\njust stay in one place\nand I just look from this\none particular visual angle\nof the screen, I find\nafter one or two talks,\nregardless of how\ninteresting the talks are,\nthat I start take on of draft,\nmy mind isn't as engaged\nand indeed, sometimes can fall asleep.\nAnd so I started this practice of moving\nfrom space to space, or I should say,\nseat to seat within an auditorium\nand it works quite well.\nAnd I think it works\nquite well because again,\nof the relationship\nbetween our visual system\ndriving the majority of our cognition,\nour visual system drives our thinking\nand that novel visual environments\nare going to lend themselves\nto heightened levels of alertness.\nNow, you don't want things\nto be so novel and scary\nor threatening or\nanxiety-provoking or loud\nthat they draw your attention\naway from your work.\nBut I think this is part of\nthe reason why turning on music\nor moving to an office or a\ncafe or an outdoor environment\nfrom an indoor environment or vice versa,\nmaybe even within a single\nday, can bring about\nmore heightened levels of productivity.\nI'd also like to acknowledge\nthat what I covered today\nis most certainly not exhaustive\nfor all the types of\nworkspace optimization tools\nthat one could create.\nFor that reason, I'd\nlove for you to suggest\nany of your workspace optimization tools\nthat you found useful.\nPlease put those in the\ncomment section on YouTube,\nthat would be the best place\nthan other people can see them.\nAlso read through those, and\nperhaps in a future episode,\nI'll call about some of\nthe ones that I've tried\non the basis of your suggestions.\nIf you're learning from, and\nare enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nAlso on YouTube, you can put comments\nin the comment section,\nso give us feedback.\nYou can make suggestions for future guests\nthat you'd like us to host\non The Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAnd in general, you can ask questions.\nWe do eventually read all the comments\nand they do influence our future content.\nPlease also subscribe\non Apple and/or Spotify.\nAnd on Apple, you have the\nopportunity to leave us\nup to a five star review.\nPlease also check out\nthe sponsors mentioned\nat the beginning of this podcast episode,\nthat's the best way to\nsupport the podcast.\nWe also have a Patreon, it's\npatreon.com/andrewhuberman,\nand there you can support the podcast\nat any level that you like.\nWe also have an Instagram\nand a Twitter account,\nit's Huberman Lab, and\nthere I teach neuroscience\nand neuroscience related tools.\nOftentimes that information\nand those tools overlap\nwith themes on the podcast,\nbut sometimes they are distinct\nfrom themes and topics\ncovered on the podcast.\nSo please follow us on\nInstagram and Twitter.\nThis episode, we didn't talk\ntoo much about supplements,\nbut on many previous episodes\nof The Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe talk about supplementation\nand while supplementation\nisn't required or great for everybody,\nsome people do derive tremendous\nbenefit from supplements.\nWe talked about supplements\nfor focus, for sleep,\nfor creativity, all sorts of things.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne, that's\nT-H-O-R-N-E.com/U/Huberman,\nthere, you can see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can get 20% off those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site,\nthrough that portal, Thorne\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off.\nAny of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nThe reason we partner with Thorne\nis because one of the major issues\nin the supplement industry is\nthat many of the supplements\nout there don't contain\nsufficient quantity,\nor they contain too much\nof a given supplement.\nAnd the quality of the\ningredients can vary tremendously.\nWith Thorne supplements,\nthere is immense stringency\nin terms of the quality of the ingredients\nand the precision of the\namounts of those ingredients\nthat they include in each product.\nOnce again, thank you for\njoining me for this discussion\nabout the science and\npeer-reviewed literature\non workspace optimization.\nI hope some, if not, all of the tools\nwill be beneficial for you, and as always\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
