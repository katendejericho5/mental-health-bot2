    "video_title": "Dr. Alia Crum: Science of Mindsets for Health & Performance",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday my guest is, Dr. Alia Crum.\nDr. Crum is a tenured\nprofessor of psychology\nat Stanford university,\nand the founder and director\nof the Stanford Mind and Body Lab.\nHer work focuses on mindsets.\nHow what we think and what we believe\nshapes the way that our physiology,\nour biology reacts to\nthings like what we eat\nor stress or exercise.\nIndeed, as you will soon learn\nfrom my discussion with Dr. Crum,\nwhat you believe about the\nnutritional content of your food\nchanges the way that food\nimpacts your brain and body\nto a remarkable degree.\nAnd the same is true for mindsets\nabout exercise and stress,\nand even medication.\nFor instance, recent work from\nDr. Crum's laboratory shows,\nthat what we believe about\nthe side effect profiles\nof different drug treatments\nor different behavioral treatments,\nhas a profound impact on how\nquickly those treatments work\nand the effectiveness of those treatments.\nI just want to mention\none particular study\nthat just came out from a graduate student\nin Dr. Crum's laboratory,\nLauren Howe, H-O-W-E,\nshowed that, how kids react to a treatment\nfor peanut allergies,\ncan be profoundly shaped\nby whether or not those kids were educated\nabout the side effects of the treatment,\nsuch that if they learned\nthat the side effects\nwere a by-product of a\ntreatment that would help them.\nAnd they learned a little bit\nabout why those side effects arose\nand that the side effects\nmight even help them\nin route to overcoming\ntheir peanut allergy,\nhad an enormous impact\non how quickly they move\nthrough the treatment\nand indeed how much they suffered\nor in this case did not suffer\nfrom those side effects.\nAnd that is, but one example\nthat you will learn about today\nas we discuss what mindsets are,\nthe number of different\nmindsets that exist,\nand how we can adopt mindsets\nthat make us more adaptive,\nmore effective,\nallow us to suffer less\nand to perform better\nin all aspects of life.\nI personally find the\nwork of Dr. Alia Crum\nto be among the most important work\nbeing done in the fields\nof biology and psychology\nand the interface of mind, body.\nEverything that she's done\nup until now and published,\nand indeed the work that\nshe continues to do,\nhas shaped everything\nwithin my daily routines,\nwithin my work routines,\nwithin my athletic routines.\nAnd we probably shouldn't be surprised\nby the fact that Dr.Crum\nworks on all these things.\nShe's not only an incredibly accomplished\ntenured research professor,\nshe's also a clinical psychologist\nand she was also a division one athlete\nand an elite gymnast at\none period in her life.\nSo she really walks the walk\nin terms of understanding\nwhat mindsets are\nand applying them in\ndifferent aspects of life.\nI'm sure you're going to learn\na ton from this conversation\nas did I, and come away with\nmany, many actionable items\nthat you can apply in your own life.\nIn fact, as we march into\ntoday's conversation,\nyou might want to just put\nin the back of your mind,\nthe question, what is\nmy mindset about blank?\nSo for instance, ask yourself,\nwhat is my mindset about stress?\nWhat is my mindset about food?\nWhat is my mindset about exercise?\nWhat is my mindset about\nrelationships of different kinds?\nBecause in doing that,\nyou'll be in a great position\nto extract the best of the information\nthat Dr. Crum presents, and\nindeed to adapt those mindsets\nin the way that is going to\nbe most beneficial for you.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science,\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nAnd keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor, is Thesis.\nThesis makes custom nootropics\nthat are ideal for the\nparticular brain states\nthat you want to be in.\nThe term nootropic means smart drug,\nand it is not a term that I like\nbecause there is no such thing\nas a universally useful smart drug.\nThe reason for that, is that\nour brain can be creative.\nWe can be focused, we can\nbe good at task switching.\nAnd each of those different things,\ncreativity, focus and task switching,\ninvolves different neurochemicals\nin different states of mind and body.\nSo the notion that\nthere's one best nootropic\nis just not accurate.\nThere's just no way\nthat could possibly be.\nThesis understands this.\nAnd for that reason,\ndesigns custom nootropics\nthat are designed to\nbring your brain and body\ninto the states that you want,\nand that are specifically\ndesigned to your neurochemistry.\nThey use only the highest\nquality ingredients,\nmany of which I've talked\nabout before on the podcast.\nThings like DHA, Gingko\nBiloba, phosphatidylserine,\nAlpha-GPC, is one that\nI particularly like,\nand is in several of the formulations\nthat are customized for me.\nHowever, Gingko Biloba,\nwhich has a lot of research to support it\nand is well tolerated by many people,\ndoesn't work well for me, it\nactually gives me headache.\nSo that one is not included\nin any of the custom formulations\nthat Thesis has made,\nparticularly for me.\nThesis has this tremendous asset,\nwhich is that they give you the ability\nto try several different blends\nover the course of a month\nand discover which nootropics work best\nfor your unique brain\nchemistry and genetics.\nSo the formulas that work for me,\nmay not be the best ones\nfor you and vice versa.\nBut in a short period of time,\nyou can dial in the\nexact nootropic formulas\nfor the states of mind and\nbody that you want to be in.\nI've been using Thesis for\nclose to six months now,\nand I can confidently say\nthat their nootropics have\nbeen a total game changer.\nI love the motivation formula,\nI also like the energy formula.\nI use those for different\nthings, it turns out,\nbut I love those.\nAnd I use their logic formula\nand their clarity formula\nthat they've customized for me.\nIn addition to their personalization,\nThesis takes it a step further,\nthey'll offer you a free\nconsultation with a brain coach\nto help optimize your\nexperience with the nootropics\nand dial in the best formulas for you.\nTo get your own personalized\nnootropic starter kit,\ngo online to takethesis.com/huberman,\ntake

system,\nand I can tell you that our visual system\nhas to contend with a huge\nnumber of different challenges,\nnot the least of which is\nwhen we go from a very bright,\nsunny spot outside into the shade,\nour visual system has to adapt\nin order for us to\ncontinue to see clearly.\nMany sunglasses out there\njust don't allow that adaptation\nto occur in a seamless way.\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nare designed with all of the biology\nof the visual system in mind,\nso that you always see\nthings with crystal clarity,\nno matter what environment you're in.\nThey also have a terrific aesthetic.\nThey have many, many different\nstyles to choose from.\nSo their eyeglasses can be worn to dinner,\nor out to lunch or to work.\nTheir sunglasses can be\nworn essentially anywhere.\nThey're very stylish and they\nwere designed for performance.\nThey won't slip off your\nface if you get sweaty,\nindeed, you can wear them\nwhile running or while cycling.\nThey're really terrific,\nthey're really versatile.\nIf you'd like to try Roka glasses,\ngo to Roka that's R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code Huberman,\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's Roka,

blood and DNA,\nto help you better meet your immediate\nand long-term health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done.\nFor the simple reason,\nthat many of the things\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health,\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get a window\ninto how your genes are\nimpacting your health\nin the short and long term,\nand the various things that you should do\nin order to adjust your\nhealth in the right direction.\nNow, one of the major issues\nwith a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there,\nis you get numbers back.\nAnd you learn whether or not\nyour lipids or your hormones, et cetera,\nare within the proper range or not.\nBut there aren't a lot of directives\nabout what to do with that information.\nInsideTracker makes all of that very easy.\nThey have a personalized dashboard\nthat allows you to, of course,\nsee the numbers that come back to you\nand to make various changes in nutrition,\nvarious changes in exercise,\nvarious changes in all\nsorts of lifestyle factors,\nthat can bring those numbers into range.\nAnd so, if you have a particular value\nfor a particular metabolic\nfactor or hormone or so forth,\nyou click on that,\nand it will actually\nbring up the full menu\nof things that you can do in\norder to adjust that factor\ninto the ranges that you like,\nall based on quality\npeer reviewed research.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get

it's Alia Crum,\nbut you go by Allie, correct?\n- That is correct.\n- Right, Dr. Allie Crum.\n- Or just Allie.\n- Okay, great.\nWell, I've been looking forward\nto talking to you for a long time.\nJust to start off, you've\ntalked a lot and worked a lot\non the science of mindsets.\nCould you define for us what is a mindset,\nand what sort of purpose does it serve.\n- Of course, yeah.\nMindsets have been described\nor defined in a lot of ways.\nWe define mindsets as core beliefs\nor assumptions that we have\nabout a domain or category of things,\nthat orient us to a particular\nset of expectations,\nexplanations and goals.\nSo that's kind of jargony,\n[chuckles], a little.\nI can distill it down for you.\nSo mindsets are an assumption\nthat you make about a domain.\nSo take stress, for example.\nThe nature of stress.\nWhat's your sort of\ncore belief about that?\nAnd mindsets that we've\nstudied about stress,\nor do you view stresses\nenhancing good for you,\nor do you view it as\ndebilitating and bad for you?\nThose mindsets, those core\nbeliefs, orient our thinking,\nthey change what we\nexpect will happen to us\nwhen we're stressed,\nhow we explain the occurrences that happen\nor unfold when we're stressed,\nand also change our motivation\nfor what we engage in\nwhen we're stressed.\nSo we have mindsets about many things,\nmindsets about stress,\nmindsets about intelligence\nas Carol Dweck's work has shown.\nMindsets about food, mindsets\nabout medicine, you name it.\nIt's sort of distilling\ndown those core assumptions\nthat really shape and orient\nour thinking in action.\n- I've heard you say before,\nthat mindsets simplify life in some way,\nby constraining the number of things\nthat we have to consider.\nAnd it sounds to me like\nwe can have mindsets\nabout many things as, as you said.\nWhat are some different mindsets?\nI think many people are familiar\nwith our colleague, Carol\nDweck's notion of growth mindset.\nThat if we're not proficient at something,\nthat we should think about\nnot being proficient yet.\nThat we are on some path to proficiency.\nBut what are some examples of mindsets,\nand how early do these get laid down,\nor do we learn them from our parents?\nMaybe if you could just\nflesh it out a bit for us\nin terms of what you've observed\nin your own science or your own life.\n- Yeah, sure, so I think it's important\nwith Carol Dweck's work.\nA lot of people kind of get focused\non growth, motivation\nand all these things,\nbut her work really originated\nfrom thinking about, what she\ncalled as implicit theories\nor core beliefs about the\nnature of intelligence\nor ability, right?\nSo do you believe that\nyour baseline levels\nof intelligence or your abilities,\nare fixed, static, set\nthroughout the rest of your life?\nOr do you believe that\nthey can grow and change?\nNow, those are over-simplified\ngeneralizations\nabout the nature of intelligence.\nAnd the reality is as\nit always is complex,\nand it's a bit of both\nand it's all the things.\nBut as humans, we need\nthese simplifying systems\nto help us understand a complex reality.\nSo those assumptions that we jumped to,\noh, intelligence is fixed or\nintelligence is malleable,\nthey help us to simplify\nthis complex reality,\nbut they're not in consequential, right?\nThey matter in shaping our motivation.\nAnd as she has shown,\nif you have the mindset,\nthat intelligence is malleable,\nyou're motivated to work harder,\nto grow your intelligence.\nIf you have a setback in\nyour learning, you think,\nokay, there's something there\nthat I can grow and learn and build from.\nIf you have the mindset that it's fixed,\nyou know, why work harder at math,\nif you don't think you're good at it.\nSo, in retrospect, it's pretty clear\nhow these mindsets can\naffect our motivation.\nWhat our work has and to do\nis to expand the range of\nmindsets that we are studying,\nfocused on, and also understand and expand\nthe range of effects that they have.\nSo by and large, we focused on mindsets\nin the domain of health\nand health behaviors.\nSo I mentioned mindsets about stress,\nwe've also looked at mindsets\nabout food and healthy eating.\nSo do you have the mindset that\nfoods that are good for you,\nhealthy foods are\ndisgusting and depriving,\nor do you have the mindset that\nhealthy foods are indulgent\nand delicious?\nNow, it could be a variety\nof different foods.\nYou might have different thoughts\nabout different healthy foods.\nBut generally people, at least\nin our culture in the West,\nhave this view that,\nstress is debilitating,\nhealthy foods are\ndisgusting and depriving.\nAnd those mindsets, whether\nor not they're true or false,\nright or wrong, they have an impact.\nAnd they have an impact,\nnot just through the\nmotivational mechanisms,\nthat Dweck and others have studied,\nbut as our lab has started to reveal,\nthey also shape physiological mechanisms\nby changing what our bodies\nprioritize and prepare to do.\nSo those are just two examples.\nMindsets about stress, mindsets\nabout food we've looked at.\nMindsets about exercise,\ndo you feel like you're getting enough,\nor do you feel like you're\ngetting an insufficient amount\nto get the health benefits you're seeking.\nMindsets about illness.\nDo you view cancer as an\nunmitigated catastrophe,\nor do you view cancer as manageable\nor perhaps even an opportunity.\nWe've looked at mindsets about\nsymptoms and side effects.\nDo you view side effects\nas a sign that the treatment is harmful,\nor do you view side effects\nas a sign that the treatment is working?\nAgain, these are sort of core beliefs\nor assumptions you have about\nthese domains or categories,\nbut they matter because they're shaping,\nthey're synthesizing and\nsimplifying the way we're thinking,\nbut they're also shaping what\nwe're paying attention to,\nwhat we're motivated to do,\nand potentially even\nhow our bodies respond.\n- Yeah, I'd love to talk about this notion\nof power of the mindset\nshaping how our bodies respond.\nAnd maybe as an example of this,\nif you could share with\nus this now famous study\nthat you've done with the milkshake study,\nif you wouldn't mind sharing\nthe major contours of that\nstudy and the results,\nbecause I think they're\nextremely impressive\nand they really speak to this interplay\nbetween mindset and physiology.\n- Certainly, yeah.\nThis was a study that I ran\nas a graduate student at Yale university.\nI was working with Kelly\nBrownell and Peter Salovey.\nPeter Salovey had done a lot of work\non really coining the term\nemotional intelligence,\nstudying [mumbles].\n- He's now the president\nof Yale, right?\n- He's now the president\nof Yale, yes.\n- So he's done well.\n- He's done well for himself\nand for the university and society.\nAnd Kelly Brownell, who\nwas doing a lot of research\non food and obesity.\nAnd I had come in doing some previous work\non mindsets about exercise and\nplacebo effects in exercise,\nand was in this sort of food domain\nand this emotions and food domain.\nAnd it really occurred to me,\nthat there was a very simple question\nthat hadn't been probed yet.\nAnd that was, do our beliefs\nabout what we're eating\nchange our body's physiological\nresponse to that food,\nholding constant, the objective\nnutrients of that thing.\nSo that question might\nsound outrageous at first,\nbut it's really not outrageous\nif you're coming from a place\nof having studied in\ndepth, placebo effects.\nPlacebo effects, in medicine, at least,\nare these sort of a robust demonstration\nin which simply taking a\nsugar pill, taking nothing,\nunder the impression that\nit's a real medication\nthat might relieve your asthma,\nreduce your blood pressure\nand boost your immune system,\ncan lead to those physiological effects\neven though there's no\nobjective nutrients.\nAnd we have more evidence\non placebo effects\nthan we have for any other drug.\n- Really?\n- Because of the clinical trial process,\nin which all new drugs and\nmedications are required\nto outperform a placebo effect.\nSo we have a lot of data\non the placebo effect.\nNow, you know, we can get nuance there.\nWe don't have a lot of data\ncomparing the placebo effect\nto doing nothing, which is important\nfor distilling mindset\neffects or belief effects\nfrom sort of natural\noccurring changes in the body.\nBut anyways, going back to\nthis question, it was like,\nall right, we've moved\nfrom medications solving our health crisis\nto behavioral medicine\nsolving our health crisis,\nincrease people's exercise,\nget them to eat better.\nTo what degree are these things\ninfluenced by our mindsets\nor beliefs about them.\nSo to test this question, we\nran a seemingly simple study.\nThis was done at the Yale center\nfor clinical and translational research.\nAnd we brought people into\nour lab under the impression\nthat we were designing\ndifferent milkshakes\nwith vastly different\nmetabolic concentrations,\nnutrient concentrations,\nthat were designed to meet\ndifferent metabolic needs\nof the patrons of the hospital, right?\nSo, you're going to come in,\nyou're going to taste these milkshakes,\nand we're going to measure your\nbody's physiological response\nto them.\nThis was within subjects design.\nSo it was the same people\nconsuming two different milkshakes,\ntwo different time points\nseparated by a week.\nAnd at one time point,\nthey were told that they were consuming\nthis really high fat, high\ncaloric indulgent milkshake.\nIt was like 620 calorie,\nsuper high fat and sugar.\nThe other time point, they were\ntold that it was a low fat,\nlow calorie, sensible sort of diet shake.\nIn reality, it was the exact same shake.\nIt was right in the middle.\nIt was like 300 calories,\nmoderate amount of fats and sugars.\nAnd we were measuring their\nbody's gut peptide response\nto this shake.\nAnd in particular, we are\nlooking at the hormone ghrelin.\nSo as you know, ghrelin,\nmedical experts call\nit the hunger hormone,\nrises and ghrelin signal,\nyou know, seek out food.\nAnd then theoretically,\nin proportion, the amount\nof calories you consume,\nghrelin levels drops\nsignaling to the brain.\nOkay, you don't need\nto eat so much anymore,\nyou can stop eating,\nand also revving up the metabolism\nto burn the nutrients\nthat were just ingested.\nWhat we found in this study was that,\nwhen people thought they were consuming\nthe high fat high calorie\nindulgent milkshake,\nin response to the shake,\ntheir ghrelin levels\ndropped at a three-fold rate\nstronger than when they thought\nthey were consuming the sensible shake.\nSo, essentially their bodies responded\nas if they had consumed more food,\neven though it was the exact\nsame shake at both time points.\nSo this was really\ninteresting and important\nfor two reasons, really.\nOne was that it was, to my knowledge,\none of the first studies\nto show any effects\nof just believing that you're\neating something different\non your physiology.\nLots of studies have shown that\nbelieving you're eating different things\nchanges your tastes and\neven your satisfaction\nand fullness after.\nBut this shows\nthat it has a metabolic or\na physiological component.\nBut the second piece was\nreally important as well.\nAnd especially for me, this was one study\nthat really transformed\nthe way I think about\nhow I approach eating.\nAnd that was the manner in which\nit affected our physiology,\nwas somewhat counterintuitive.\nSo, I had gone in thinking,\nthe better mindset to be in when you eat\nis that you're eating healthy, right?\nLike, you know, just makes sense.\nLike placebo effects think you're healthy,\nyou'll be healthy, you know.\nBut that was a far too simplistic\nway of thinking about it.\nAnd in fact, it was the exact opposite\nbecause thinking that they were eating,\nwhen these participants thought\nthey were eating sensibly,\ntheir bodies left them\nstill feeling physiologically\nhungry, right?\nNot satiated.\nWhich could potentially\nbe corresponding to slower\nmetabolism and so forth.\nSo, if you're in the interest\nof maintaining or losing weight,\nwhat's the best mindset to be in?\nIt's to be in a mindset that\nyou're eating indulgently.\nThat you're having enough food,\nthat you're getting enough.\nAnd at least in that study,\nwe showed that has a more adaptive effect\non ghrelin responses.\n- So interesting.\nAnd especially interesting\nto me as a neuroscientist\nwho has worked on aspects\nof the nervous system\nthat are involved in conscious perception,\nlike vision and motion and\ncolor perception and so forth.\nBut also, our lab has worked\nand is increasingly working\non autonomic functions\nthat are below our conscious detection.\nIn this case, a lie\nabout how much something\nthese milkshakes contained\naffected a subconscious process,\nbecause I have to imagine\nthat the ghrelin pathway\nis not one that I can decide,\noh, this particular piece of chocolate\nis going to really reduce my ghrelin\n'cause it's very nutrient rich,\nas opposed to one,\nif you told me that a\ndifferent piece of chocolate,\nfor instance, is a low calories\nor sugar free chocolate\nor something that sort.\nThe ghrelin pathway, however,\nit seems based on your data,\nthat the ghrelin pathway\nis susceptible to faults,\nwhich is incredible.\nBut then again, there must be crossover\nbetween conscious thought\nand these subconscious\nor kind of autonomic pathways.\nSo, it's really remarkable.\nIt raises a question\nthat I just have to ask,\nbecause it increasingly,\nso I'm involved in online\ndiscussions and social media,\nin one of the most barbed\nwire topics out there,\nand that's being generous,\nis this topic of which\ndiet or nutrients are best?\nYou've got people who\nare strictly plant-based,\nyou've got people who are omnivores,\nyou got people who are carnivores.\nYou have every variation.\nYou have intermittent fasting,\nalso called time restricted feeding.\nAnd it seems like, once a group\nand it plugs into a\nparticular mode of eating\nthat they feel works for them,\nfor whatever reason,\nenergy wise, mentally,\nmaybe they're looking\nat their blood profiles,\nmaybe they're not.\nBut once they feel that it works for them,\neach camp seems to tout\nall the health benefits\nand how great they feel.\nCould it be that mindset\neffects are involved there?\nThat people are finding\nthe nutritional program\nthat they feel brings them\nthe most enrichment of life,\nbut also nutrients.\nAnd that their health really is shifting\nin a positive direction,\nbut not necessarily because\nof the food constituents,\nbut because of the community,\nand the ideas and the reinforcement.\n- Yeah, and the belief\nthat this is the right\nway of doing something.\nI think, a hundred percent it\nhas something to contribute.\nI'm not going to weigh in on the debate.\nWhat I will most certainly weigh in on,\nis the notion that,\nlook going back to the\nplacebo effect, right?\nWe have a outdated\nunderstanding of what that is,\nwhich is based on this\nrandomized controlled trial,\nyou compare a drug to a placebo.\nIf the drug works better than the placebo,\nyou say, great, the drug works.\nIf the drug doesn't\noutperform the placebo,\nyou say the drug doesn't work.\nThat's really over simplified.\nIt's a good test for the\nspecific efficacy of the drug.\nIt's not a good test\nfor understanding the\ntotal impact of that drug.\nBecause in the reality of things,\nif a drug outperforms a placebo,\nthen you start prescribing it.\nBut the reality is, that the\ntotal effect of that drug,\nis a combined product\nof the specific chemical\nattributes of that drug\nand whatever's going on\nin the placebo effect,\nwhich is, at least from our perspective,\nits beliefs, its social context,\nand it's your body's natural ability\nto respond to something.\nSo, that's in the placebo effect example.\nThe same is true for\neverything we do or consume.\nSo when it comes to\nwhat diet you're eating,\nboth are true.\nIt does matter what it is\nand it matters what you\nthink about that diet\nand what others around you\nin our culture think about that diet.\nBecause those social\ncontexts inform our mindsets,\nour mindsets interact with our physiology\nin ways that produce outcomes\nthat are really important.\nSo let's not get dualistic\nand say, it's either all in\nthe mind or not in the mind.\nLet's also not be unnecessarily combative\nand say, oh, it should be all plant-based\nor keto or whatever.\nIt's all of those things\nare a combined product\nof what you're actually doing,\nand what you're thinking about.\nIf you believe in it, if you\ndon't, if you're skeptical,\nor in some cases,\nyou think you should\nbe eating a certain way\nand then you don't live up to that.\nIt might have even an adverse\neffect because of the stress\nand the anxiety associated with that.\n- Very interesting.\nAlong the lines of belief effects,\ncould we call these belief\neffects or mindsets?\n- Sure, yeah.\n- Is there a difference\nbetween these what I'm\ncalling belief effects\nand placebo effects?\nI mean, are placebo effects\ndistinctly different\nfrom mindset effects or they\nmore or less the same thing.\n- They're related?\nSo I think placebo effects,\nmaybe should be reserved\nfor the conditions\nin which you're actually taking a placebo,\nwhich is inactive substance.\nWhen you get out of that sort\nof placebo versus drug realm,\nand you start looking at placebo effects,\nI use quotes with my hands\nhere, in behavioral health,\nthe term kind of becomes\nconfusing because you're not--\nIn the milkshake study,\nwe didn't give people a\nplacebo milkshake, right?\nWe just changed what\nthey believed about it.\nSo, how I like to think about it is that,\nplacebo effects, as they're\ntraditionally construed\nare made up of three things.\nIt's the social context,\nmindsets or beliefs,\nand the natural physiological processes\nin the brain and body that\ncan produce the outcomes.\nAnd so, we could just\ncall them belief effects\nbecause the beliefs are triggering\nthe physiological processes,\nand the beliefs are shaped\nby the social context.\nDoes that make sense?\n- It makes sense.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, there was a\npaper a year or two ago\npublished in science magazine\nabout brain regions involved\nin psychogenic fever.\nThat if people or you can actually do this\nin animal models to\nthink that they are sick,\nyou get a genuine one to three degree\nincrease in body temperature,\none to three degrees Fahrenheit\nincrease in body temperature\nis pretty impressive.\n- Yeah.\n- And I guess it plays into\nsymptomology generally.\nSo, I'm a believer in belief effects.\n- Just say that, you know,\nthe term that we use in our field\nis nocebo effect for that,\nwhich is sort of the\nplacebo's ugly stepsister.\nIt's when negative beliefs\ncause negative consequences.\nSo, you are told you will have--\nIt's very well demonstrated\nthat when people are told\nabout certain side effects,\nthey're far more likely to\nexperience those side effects.\nWhen people think that they're\nsick or going to get sick,\nsometimes that can create\nthe physiological symptoms.\nAnd there's various debates.\nThat it's not only that\nphysiology changes,\nit's also that your attention changes.\nSo we're experiencing things\nlike fatigue and headache\nand upset stomach all the time.\nAnd then when you take a\ndrug and somebody says,\nyou're going to feel fatigue and headache,\nyou start noticing that you're tired,\nand that headaches attributed to the drug.\nSo, some of the mechanisms are attention,\nand some of them are real\nchanges in physiology.\n- I'd love for you to tell us\nabout the hotel workers study.\n- Yeah, sure.\n- I know you get asked these\nquestions all the time,\nbut I find just these\nresults also amazing.\n- Yeah, no, I think that\nthis is a really good example\nof this phenomenon, right?\nThat the total effect of anything\nis a combined product of what you're doing\nand what you think\nabout what you're doing.\nSo this was a study that\nI ran with Ellen Langer\nway back when I was an undergrad actually.\nWe started this study.\nEllen Langer is a professor\nof psychology at Harvard,\nand she's done a lot of\nreally fascinating work\non her flavor of mindfulness,\nwhich is distinct from\na more Eastern mind,\nBuddhist sort of mindfulness-based work.\nShe actually was the one\nwho said to me originally,\nyou know, I was an athlete at the time.\nI was an ice hockey player\nand I was training constantly.\nAnd one day I'll never forget it.\nShe said, you know the benefit of exercise\nis just a placebo, right?\nAnd I was like, well, that's outrageous.\nEllen's known for saying very provocative,\nbut also very wise things.\nAnd that statement really\ngot me thinking about that.\nSo we designed this study\ntogether and that was to look at,\nhow would you study?\nIf the benefits of\nexercise were a placebo,\nhow would you even test that?\nBecause, what does it mean\nto give a placebo exercise?\nSo we sort of flipped it on its head.\nAnd we found a group of people\nwho were getting a lot of exercise,\nbut weren't aware of it,\nthat they were, right?\nSo this, we settled on a\ngroup of hotel housekeepers.\nSo these are women working in hotels\nwho were on their feet all day long,\npushing carts, changing\nlinens, climbing stairs,\ncleaning bathrooms, vacuuming.\nIt was clear that they were\ngetting above and beyond\nat least the surgeon General's\nrequirements at that time,\nor which were to accumulate 30 minutes\nof moderate physical activity per day.\nBut what was interesting\nwas when we went in\nand surveyed them and asked them,\nHey, how much exercise do\nyou think you're getting?\nA third of them said, zero.\nI don't get any exercise.\nAnd the average response was like a three,\non a scale of zero to 10.\nSo it's clear that even though\nthese women were active,\nthey didn't have that mindset, right?\nThey had the mindset that\ntheir work was just work.\nHard, maybe thankless work\nthat led them to feel tired\nand in pain at the end of the day.\nBut not that it was good for them,\nthat it was good exercise.\nSo what we did was we took these women\nand we randomized them into two groups,\nand we told half of them that\ntheir work was good exercise.\nIn this case, it was\ntrue factual information.\nWe oriented them to the\nsurgeon General's guidelines.\nWe oriented them\nto the benefits that\nthey should be receiving.\nAnd then we had measured them previously,\non their physiological metrics,\nlike weight and body fat\nand blood pressure.\nAnd we came back four weeks\nlater and we tested them again.\nAnd what we found was that these women,\neven though they hadn't changed\nanything in their behavior,\nat least that was detectable to us.\nThey didn't work more rooms,\nthey didn't start doing\npull-ups or push-ups\nin between cleaning hotel\nrooms, as far as I'm concerned.\nThey didn't report any\nchanges in their diet,\nbut they had benefits to their health.\nSo they lost weight.\nThey decreased their\nsystolic blood pressure\nby about 10 points on average.\nAnd they started feeling\nbetter about themselves,\ntheir bodies and their\nwork, not surprisingly.\n- That's amazing.\nHow do we conceptualize that result\nin light of all of our efforts\nto get more out of exercise, right?\nBecause earlier you mentioned\nit from the milkshake study\nand our perceptions\nabout nutrient density,\nthat the right message\nthat is actually a little\nbit counterintuitive.\nThat if you think, oh,\nthis is very low calorie,\nnutrient sparse, then it's good for me\nin the context of losing\nweight for instance.\nBut it turns out the opposite is true,\nbecause as you told us, the\nbody responds differently\nwhen you think something is nutrient dense\nand can actually suppress hunger more.\nSo, in light of this\nresult, if I were to say,\nokay, my current understanding\nof the literature\nis that getting somewhere\nbetween 150 and 180 minutes per week\nof cardiovascular exercise\nis probably a good idea for most people.\nIf I tell myself that\nit's not just a good idea,\nbut that it's extremely effective\nin lowering my blood pressure\nand maintaining healthy\nweight, et cetera, et cetera,\naccording to these results,\nit will have an enhanced\neffect on those metrics.\nIs that right?\n- Definitely.\nSo this is a really important point,\nbecause what this reveals\nis that we have to be more thoughtful\nin how we go about\nmotivating people to exercise\nor teaching people about the benefits.\nOur current approach is just\nto basically tell people,\nwrit large, here's what you need to get.\nHere's what you need to get good for.\nTo get enough exercise to\nreceive the health benefit.\nThe problem with that approach is that,\nmost people aren't meeting\nthose benefits yet,\nthey aren't meeting\nthose requirements yet.\nAnd the risk with that is that,\nwell, the intention with\nthat is to motivate them\nbecause public health officials think,\nwell, if I just tell people\nyou need to get more exercise\nbecause it's good for you, they'll do it.\nWe know now that that doesn't work,\nthat these guidelines\nare not motivational.\nThey don't change our behavior.\nAnd what our work adds to that,\nis that not only is it not motivational,\nit also creates potentially a mindset\nthat makes people worse off\nthan they were without\nknowing about the guidelines.\nSo again, it's tricky.\nI'm not saying that mindset is everything.\nCertainly exercise is good\nfor us and is helpful for us.\nIt's one of the things\nwe have the best data on.\nSo I'm not saying, oh,\nexercises all a placebo.\nWhat I am saying is that,\nwe need to be more mindful\nabout how do we motivate\npeople to exercise,\nbut how do we help people\nto actually reap the\nbenefits of the exercise\nthey are already doing?\nNow, Octavia, who is a\ngrad student in my lab,\nran a number of interesting\nstudies along these lines.\nOne in which she looked at\nthree nationally representative data sets,\nwhich had this interesting\nquestion in them,\nwhich was how much exercise\ndo you get relative to others?\nDo you get about the same,\na little more, a lot more,\ndo you get a little less\nor a lot less, right?\nSo, the audience, your listeners,\nyou could all answer this.\nAnd then in these datasets, what she did,\nwas she had pulled from data\nthat tracked death rates\nover the next 21 years.\nAnd a couple interesting\nthings revealed themselves.\nOne was that,\nthe correlations between\nthese perceptions of exercise\nrelative to others, and\npeople's actual exercise\nas measured through accelerometer data,\nas well as more rigorous sort\nof what did you do today,\nkind of data.\nThose don't correlate much at all.\n- People lie.\n- Well, people lie, but also...\n- Or misperceive.\n- ...They misperceive.\nOr who's to say, it's misperceiving,\neverything's relative, right?\nI used to do triathlons very seriously.\nSo if you were to ask me now,\nI feel like I'm totally inactive, right?\nBecause I'm not doing\nanything near what I used to.\nAnd if that's my focus set, right?\nI feel like I'm not exercising much.\nBut if I think about, you\nknow, compared to other people,\ngiven what I know about national\nrepresentative statistics,\nand I could feel like, oh,\nI'm getting a lot, right?\nSo you can see how these perceptions\nare decoupled from objective reality.\nAnd what we found in these studies,\nis that, that one question mattered\nin some cases, more\nthan objective activity,\nbut in all cases controlling\nfor objective activity\nand predicting death rates.\nAnd in one of the samples,\nit was a 71% higher risk of death rate.\nYou know, if people rated themselves\nas feeling like they were getting\nless activity than others.\n- Wow.\nThat's a big deal.\n- It's a big deal.\nAnd again, that study is\ncross-sectional, longitudinal,\nit was not experimental.\nBut combined, these really\nsort of coalesced to say,\nHey, this is important too, right?\nLike, let's figure out ways to be active\nand get people active,\nbut let's also not make\npeople feel horrible\nabout themselves when\nthey're not getting enough.\nAnd going back to the hotel study again,\nI mentioned that I did that at a time\nwhen I was a division one ice\nhockey player at the time.\nWe were training all the time.\nAnd I was in an unhealthy\nmindset about that,\nI never felt like I was getting enough.\nI would come off a two hour practice\ninto a weightlifting session.\nAnd then I would get on the\nelliptical for 30 minutes,\n'cause I thought I had to do that also.\nMy teammates who were with me at the time\ncould attest to that.\nAnd so, that study was\nreally helpful for me,\nto realize that I needed pay attention,\nnot just to what I was doing,\nbut also take care of\nmy mindset about that.\nAnd I think the essence\nis how do you get people\nto feel like they're getting enough?\nIt's a sense of enoughness\nthat really matters.\n- Yeah, I can see the dilemma\nbecause you don't want people thinking\nthat exercise and its\npositive effects are so potent\nthat they can get away with\na three minute walk each day.\nAnd that they're good because\nmost likely they are not.\nBut again, you don't want them\nto be so back on their\nheels psychologically\nthat they don't even do that\nor that they never exceed that\nby very much.\nBut it seems like the message\nfrom the milkshake study\nand what we're talking about\nnow in terms of exercise\nwould be to really communicate\nto the general public\nthat food has a potency,\neven healthy foods have a\npotency to give us energy,\nto fuel our immune system and\nendocrine system, et cetera.\nAnd that exercise has\na remarkable potency,\nand that that potency can be enhanced\nby believing in or\nunderstanding that potency.\n- Exactly.\n- Is that an accurate way to state it?\n- Totally, that's exactly right.\nAnd that's where I really\nfeel like we need to push.\nAnd what I try to do in our research,\nis to not just show, oh, mindset matters,\nisn't that interesting?\nBut it both matter, right?\nBoth exercise and what\nyou think about it matter.\nBoth what you eat\nand how you think about\nwhat you eat matter.\nAnd so, we really, as\nindividuals and as a society\nneed to work on, what is\nthe right way to cultivate\nboth behaviors and mindsets\nabout those behaviors that serve us?\nAnd in the food context, this--\nAgain, that milkshake\nstudy really changed me\non a personal level,\nbecause I had been somebody\nwho was constantly trying to\nrestrain my eating, right?\nI wanted to maintain or\nlose weight, look fit.\nAnd so, I was like, well, I should diet\nand I should have low calorie, low carb.\nLow this, low that.\nBut what that was doing,\nwas putting me into this\nconstant mindset of restraint.\nAnd what that study suggested,\nwas that that mindset was\npotentially counteracting\nany benefit or any objective\neffects of the restrained diet.\nBecause my brain was saying,\nokay, you're restraining.\nMaybe my body was responding to that.\nBut the brain was also\nsaying, eat more food,\nstay hungry 'cause you need to survive.\nAnd so, the answer isn't,\noh, we'll throw everything into the wind\nand just drink indulgent\nmilkshakes all day long.\nThe answer is, eat healthy foods, right?\nBased on the latest science\nand what we know to be\ntrue about nutrients\nand our body's response to them,\nbut try to do so in a mindset indulgence,\na mindset of satisfaction, a\nmindset of enjoyment, right?\nThat is really the trick.\nAnd that's what I at least\ntry to do in my own life.\n- I love that, and as I get more involved\nin the anti-public facing\nhealth communications,\nthis comes up again and again, you know,\nhow should we conceptualize our behavior?\nHow should we think\nabout all these options\nthat are offered to us?\nAnd I'm excited that\nthe potency of mindsets\nare coming through again and again.\nSo, I have a question about this.\nI don't know if this\nstudy has ever been done,\nbut a lot of these mindset effects\nare something that years ago,\nI felt I did vis-a-vis sleep.\nBecause I was in graduate\nschool, and as a postdoc,\nand even as an undergraduate,\nI had so much work to do\nthat I decided I would\nsleep when I was \"dead\".\nNot a good idea from what we know.\nHowever, I found that a\ncouple nights of minimal sleep\nor even an all-nighter and\nI could do pretty well.\nEventually it would catch up with me.\nHas there ever been a study\nexploring whether or not the\neffects of sleep deprivation\ncan be impacted by these mindset effects?\nBecause over the years, I\nkeep learning more and more\nabout how much sleep I need\nand I've really emphasized it,\nbut I do feel much better\nwhen I'm getting it.\nBut as new parents know,\nor students know or athletes know\nor anyone that lives a normal life\nfind sometimes that they don't\nget a good night's sleep.\nWould believing that we can tolerate that\nand push through it\nand function just fine,\nand that it's not going to\nkill us or give us Alzheimer's.\nCould that help us deal\nwith a poor night's sleep\nor even two or chronic sleep deprivation?\n- Certainly I would guess.\nThere's been one study to my\nknowledge that's tested that.\n[indistinct] and colleagues,\nand they looked at--\nThey had people come in and they gave them\nsort of a, I think it was\na sham sort of EEG test\nto figure out how--\nThis was done a number of years ago.\nNow we actually have devices to test this,\nbut there's was this sham test.\nAnd then they gave people fake feedback\nabout the quality of their sleep\nand how it had been the night before.\nAnd they also asked the participants\nhow they felt about their sleep.\nAnd essentially what they found\nwas that this sham feedback,\nif they were told that they had gotten\nand let lower quality sleep\nled to deficits in variety\nof cognitive tasks.\nAnd that was sort of decoupled\nfrom their actual [laughs]\nqualities of sleep,\nat least as self-reported.\nSo that's one study that attest\nto this, I think certainly,\nI would bet a lot of money,\nI haven't run those myself,\nbut that your mindsets can push around\nyour cognitive functioning,\nphysiological effects of sleep.\nBut once again, it's not\nall or nothing, right?\nThere are real important\nbenefits of sleep,\nand how far we can push around\nthat through our mindset,\nis an open question.\n- You know what?\nThe result that you mentioned\nis really interesting\nbecause a lot of people use\nthese sleep trackers now.\nThey're using rings or wristbands.\nIn fact, my lab has worked pretty closely\nwith a company that they supplied us data\non how well people are sleeping,\nand you get a score,\npeople get the score back.\nWhen they see that score,\nthey might think based on these results,\noh, my recovery score,\nmy sleep score is poor.\nI shouldn't expect much from myself today,\nor it makes sense that\nmy memory would be going.\nFor this reason,\nand I'll probably lose a\nfew friends for saying this,\nbut hopefully I'll gain a few as well.\nThat's why I like to just do\na subjective score for myself.\nIf I wake up in the morning,\nI just decide, okay,\ndid I sleep well or not?\nI don't like seeing a number.\nI don't like getting a\nreadout from a device.\nThat's me, I know a lot of people like it,\nand they can be very useful.\nBut gosh, it seems that\nthese belief effects\nare weaving in at all levels.\nI'd love for us to talk about stress,\nbecause your lab has\nworked extensively on this.\nAnd if you would, could you tell us\nat some point about the\nstudy that you've done\nabout informing people\nabout the different effects of stress.\nBut also, if there's an opportunity,\nsome takeaways about how we\ncould each conceptualize stress\nin ways that would make it serve us better\nas opposed to harm us\nand our mental and physical performance.\n- Great, yeah, so I'd come off the heels\nof doing some research\nin exercise and diet\nand finding these provocative\nand also counterintuitive effects\nwith respect to how we should\ntry to motivate people, right?\nAnd, as I was thinking about this,\nand this grouping of going\nfrom medicines to saving us\nto behaviors to saving us,\nand how those behaviors might\nbe influenced by mindsets.\nThe obvious next thing to\nthink about with stress, right?\nBecause it's like, okay,\nwell you want to be\nhealthier and fix your diet,\nfix your exercise and stress less.\nAnd so I started doing some digging\ninto the nature of stress\nand a couple things were clear.\nOne was that the public health message\nwas very clear, right?\nThat stress was bad, right?\nUnmitigated and harmful on our health,\nour productivity, our\nrelationships, our fertility,\nour cognition, you name it, right?\nAnd the messages that were out there,\nby and large over-simplified messages\nfocused on the damaging\nconsequences of stress.\nBut as you know, if you\nactually dive deeper\ninto the literature on stress\nand the origins of stress,\nwhat you find is that, the\nliterature like most literatures\nis not so clear cut.\nAnd in fact, there's a\nlarge amount of evidence\nto support the fact that\nthe experience of stress,\nmeaning encountering\nadversity or challenge\nin one's goal related efforts,\ndoes not have to be debilitating.\nAnd in many cases, the body's response\nwas designed to enhance our ability\nto manage at those moments, right?\nSo some research showing that\nstress narrows our focus,\nincreases our attention,\nspeeds up the rate\nat which we're able to\nprocess information.\nThere was some research out there\nshowing this phenomenon of\nphysiological toughening,\nthe process by which the\nrelease of catabolic hormones\nand the stress response\nrecruit or activate anabolic hormones,\nwhich help as you know build our muscles,\nbuild our neurons, to\nhelp us grow and learn.\nAnd there was a whole\nbody of emerging research\non post-traumatic growth\nor this phenomenon in\nwhich even the experience\nof the most traumatic stressors,\nthe most chronic and enduring stressors,\ncould lead not to destruction,\nbut in fact, to the exact opposite,\nto an enhanced sense of\nconnection with our values,\nconnection to others, sense\nof joy and passion for living.\nAnd so, I found that to be interesting.\nAnd my work since then has\nbeen not to try to argue\nthat stress is enhancing\nand not debilitating,\nbut try to point out that\nthe true nature of stress\nis a paradox.\nThe true nature of stress\nis manifold and complex,\nand lots of things can happen.\nBut to question, what's the\nrole of our mindset about stress\nin shaping our response to stress.\nSo some work had already been done\nlooking at your perception\nof the stressor, right?\nSo, do you view a stressor\nlike a challenging exam\nor a health diagnosis as\na challenge or a threat.\nAnd that had shown pretty convincingly\nthat when you view stressors\nmore as a challenge,\nless as a threat,\nthat your brain and body\nresponds more adaptively.\nWhat our question was,\nwas to take the sort of\npsychological construal\none step higher in abstraction.\nSo not just the stressor, but\nthe nature of stress, right?\nAt that core level,\ndo you view stress as\nsomething that's bad,\nis going to kill us and\ntherefore should be avoided,\nor do you view some stress as natural\nand something that's going to enhance us?\nAnd so, we set out to\ndesign a series of studies\nto test the extent\nto which these mindsets\nabout stress mattered.\nWe first, this again\nwas with Peter Salovey and\nShawn Achor, originally.\nWe designed a measure to\ntest people's mindsets\nabout stress.\nSimple questions like,\nwhat extent do you believe\nor agree or disagree with statements like,\nstress enhances my\nperformance and productivity.\nStress heightens my vitality\nand growth, things like that.\nAnd we found in a number\nof correlational studies\nthat a more enhancing stress mindset\nwas linked to better health outcomes,\nbetter wellbeing and higher performance.\nSo then we set out\nto see if we could\nchange people's mindsets.\nAnd in our first test of\nthis, we decided to do so\nby creating these multimedia films\nthat showcased research, anecdotes,\nfacts about stress, all true,\nbut oriented towards one\nmindset or the other, right?\nSo you can imagine one set of films\nshowed basically the\nmessages that were out there\nin the public health context.\nThe other showed,\nHey, you know, stress has\nbeen linked to these things,\nbut in fact, the body's stress response\nwas designed to do this.\nDid you know it could do that?\nAnd we had empowering images\nlike LeBron James making the\nfree-throw in the final minute\nversus missing it, right?\nSo all of these things\nare true possibilities\nbut oriented to two different\nmindsets about stress.\n- So either people saw a video\nthat basically made it seem\nlike stress will diminish\nyou, crush you, reduce you,\nor a video very similar,\nstress will grow you,\nbring out your best,\nand maybe even take you to\nheightened levels of performance\nthat you've never experienced before.\n- Exactly, exactly.\nSo, yeah, examples in the sports,\nwe also had like true leaders emerge\nin the moments of greatest\nstress, you know, Churchill.\nAnd so, all those examples are out there\nfor both the enhancing nature\nand the debilitating nature.\nAnd our question was,\ndoes orienting people\nto different mindsets\nchange how they respond to stress?\nSo this study was done\nin the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\nWe worked with UBS, a\nfinancial service company\nthat was undergoing pretty\nmassive amounts of layoffs.\nSo these employees were\nstressed about being laid off.\nThey were taking on more pressure.\nIt was just a tough time.\nAnd we randomized them\ninto three conditions.\nAnd this was all pre-work before\ngetting training on stress,\nbut the three different\nconditions, some watched no videos,\nsome watched the stressful crushy videos\nand some watched the stress\ncould enhance you videos.\nAnd what we found was that just--\nIt was a total of nine minutes of videos\nover the course of the week,\nled to changes in their\nmindsets about stress,\nwhich led to changes in\ntheir physiological symptoms\nassociated with stress.\nSo people who watched the enhancing films\nhad fewer backaches,\nmuscle tension, insomnia,\nracing heart, and so forth.\nAnd they also reported\nperforming better at work\ncompared to those who watched\nthe debilitating videos.\nNow interestingly, we\ndidn't make anyone worse\nwith the debilitating videos.\n- Wow, that's good.\n- Which was good.\nWe were told that the\nIRB we didn't expect that\nbecause that message\nwas already out there,\nthat's what they were already seeing,\nthat wasn't new to them.\nIt was more of this enhancing perspective\nthat turned out to be inspiring.\n- I love that study, and I know\nwe both have friends and ties\nin the special operations community\nthrough just sort of happenstance\nand maybe we'll get into\nthat a little later,\nbut a good friend from\nthat community always says,\nthere are only three ways to\ngo through life at any moment,\nwhich is either back on your heels,\nflat-footed or forward center of mass.\nAnd I said, well, well,\nwhat's the key to forward center of mass?\nAnd he said, \"Stress is what places you\n\"in forward center of mass,\"\nmeaning leaning forward\nand into challenge.\nAnd I know that you've actually\nlooked at that community\nand it does really seem\nlike that's a mindset that\neither they have going in\nor that they cultivate through\nthe course of their training.\nBut this notion\nthat stress is what puts\nus in forward motion,\nis true physiologically, right?\nI mean, adrenaline's major role\nis to place us into a moment of,\nor bias us towards action,\nthat's why we tremble.\nIt's the body trying to initiate action.\nBut actually this is\nprobably a good opportunity.\nIf there was anything interesting\nto extract from the study\non SEAL teams, what was it?\n- Yeah, no, I loved\nworking with the SEALs.\nAnd one of the interesting\nthings we found,\nso we've studied this,\nmeasured this mindset\nin several different populations.\nAnd in every single one\nthat we have tested so far,\nthe average had been on the\ndebilitating side of the scale.\n- People just saying stress is bad.\n- Stress is bad, right?\nLike with measures of\ngrowth and fixed mindsets\nabout intelligence,\npeople are in the middle,\nbut oftentimes have a\nmore positive mindsets\nabout intelligence.\nThat was not the case\nwith stress, [chuckles].\nIt's still not the case.\nI'm trying to get the message out there.\nExcept for this group of Navy SEALs.\nWhen they were actually recruit,\nso people who were going\nthrough basic training\nin order to become Navy SEALs.\nAnd we found that they on average\nhad stresses enhancing mindset,\nperhaps not surprisingly, right?\nIf you're going in\nto devote your whole life\nto being a Navy SEAL,\nyou must have some inclination\nthat stress is a source\nof strength for you.\nBut what we found with them,\nwe measured this at the beginning\nof their basic training,\nof buds training,\nand then looked at how well they succeeded\nthrough that program.\nSo as you know, this is an\nextremely rigorous program.\nAt the time it was only\nlike 10 or 20% of trainees.\n- Still is, the numbers have\nnever shifted from about that.\nNo matter how hard pressures\non the community change,\nthe numbers are still about\non average, about 15%.\n- Yeah, wow.\nSo, what we found was that our\nmeasure predicted that rate.\nSo people even within that range\nhad a more stresses enhancing mindset\nwere more likely to complete\ntraining, become a SEAL.\nThey also had faster\nobstacle course times,\nand they were rated by\ntheir peers more positively.\nSo, again, let's break this down, right?\nThis doesn't mean, and people\nget this wrong sometimes.\nThey think that I'm saying,\nthat a stresses enhancing mindset\nmeans you should stress, right?\nWell, maybe SEALs do.\nBut that's not what we're saying, right?\nHaving a stresses enhancing mindset\ndoesn't mean the stressor\nis a good thing, right?\nIt doesn't mean it's a good thing\nthat you have to go into combat\nand it's not pretty, right?\nIt doesn't mean\nthat getting a cancer\ndiagnosis is a good thing\nor being an abject\npoverty is a good thing.\nThese are not good things.\nBut the experience of the\nstress associated with that,\nthe challenge, the adversity,\nthat experience can lead\nto and enhancing outcomes\nwith respect to not just our cognition,\nbut our health, our\nperformance and our wellbeing.\nSo that mindset, right?\nHow does that work, right?\nWell, it works through a\nnumber of different pathways.\nOne is that it changes fundamentally\nwhat we're motivated to do.\nSo if you just imagine we're\nstressed about something,\nmaybe a global pandemic, for example.\n- For instance.\n- For instance.\nAnd you think that stress is bad,\nthen what's your motivation, right?\nYour motivation is to,\nwell, first you get worried\nabout the stress, right?\nNow not only do you have the pandemic,\nyou're stressed about the\nstress of the pandemic.\nBut second is,\nyour reaction is typically\nto do one of two things.\nIt's either to freak out\nand do everything you can\nto make sure that this\ndoesn't affect you negatively,\nor to check out and say,\noh, it's not a big deal.\nI'm not going to deal with that.\nYou're basically in denial.\nSo, people who have a\nstresses debilitating mindset\nand we've shown this in our research,\ntend to go to one of the\nother of those extremes.\nThey freak out, or they check out, why?\nBecause if stress is bad you\nneed to either get rid of it\nand deal with it or it\nneeds to not exist, right?\nIf you have a stressors enhancing mindset,\nthe motivation changes, right?\nThen the motivation is,\nhow do I utilize the stress\nto realize the enhancing outcomes?\nWhat can we do here, right?\nTo learn from this experience,\nto make us stronger, fitter,\nhave better science and\ntreatments for the future,\ndeepen my relationships with others,\nimprove my priorities and so forth, right?\nSo the motivation changes,\nthe affect around it changes,\nit doesn't make it easy to deal with.\nBut what we've shown in\nour research is that,\npeople who have a\nstresses enhancing mindset\nhave more positive effect,\nnot necessarily less negative effect,\nand it potentially changes physiology.\nWe have a few studies that show that\npeople who are inspired to\nadopt more enhancing mindsets,\nhave more moderate cortisol response,\nand they have higher levels of DHA levels\nin response to stress.\nSo, more work needs to be\ndone on the physiology,\nbut I'd love your take on the mechanisms\nthrough which that's possible.\n- Yes, and DHA of course\nis an anabolic hormone\nin both men and women.\nVery interesting, because we\nhad a guest on this podcast.\nHe actually he's a PhD scientist\nwho runs the UFC Performance\nTraining Institute,\nhis name is Duncan French.\nAnd his graduate work at Yukon\nstores was very interesting.\nIt was in exercise science and physiology.\nWhat he showed was that,\nif you could spike the\nadrenaline response...\nI think they did this\nthrough first time skydive\nor something like that.\n...That testosterone went up.\nNow, this spits in the face\nof everything that we're told about stress\nand testosterone levels, right?\nAnd this has also been looked\nat in females with estrogen.\nAlthough of course, there's\nestrogen and testosterone,\nboth males and females,\nbut that's how they\nhad designed the study.\nSo it turns out that at\nleast in the short term,\nthat a very stressful event\ncan raise anabolic hormones.\nAnd I think that people\nforget at a mechanistic level\nthat adrenaline is epinephrin,\nand epinephrin is biochemically derived\nfrom the molecule dopamine.\nIf you look at the pathway,\nand even just Google it and go images,\nyou'll see that adrenaline\nis made from dopamine.\nAnd dopamine and these anabolic hormones\nthey're sort of close cousins.\nThey work together in the\npituitary and hypothalamus.\nSo it makes sense that\none could leverage stress\ntoward growth,\nand towards anibalism as\nopposed to cannibalism,\nwhich is not saying cannibalism\nas in eating other people,\nbut catabolic processes,\nis I guess, the right way to refer to it.\nBut what's again remarkable to me,\nis that all of these brain structures\nthat control dopamine, epinephrin,\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nthey're all thought to\nbe in the subconscious,\nmeaning below our ability to flip a switch\nand turn them on or off.\n- [Alia] Right.\n- And yet mindset seemed to impact them.\nSo I've all that to say,\nthat there's a clear mechanistic basis\nby which this could all work.\nSo on the one hand I'm surprised,\nbecause these are incredible results.\nOn the other hand, I'm not surprised\nbecause there's a\nphysiological substrate there\nthat could readily explain them.\n- Yeah, and I think figuring\nout exactly how it works\nis really, [chuckles].\n- We should do that.\n- We should do that.\n- We should collaborate.\n- Let's do it.\n- We've got common friends\nin both departments,\nso we should do it.\n- But I did want to mention,\nthe way I think about mindset,\nand again, I think we need to study this.\nI'm not a neuroscientist,\nso I haven't looked at this,\nbut this is something we could do.\nBut the way I think about mindset,\nis that mindsets are kind of a portal\nbetween conscious and\nsubconscious processes.\nThey operate as a default\nsetting of the mind, right?\nSo, if sort of programmed in there,\nyou have stress equals bad, right?\nThat is going to be something\nmaybe conscious, right?\nBut it doesn't have to\nbe conscious, right?\nPeople don't have to know\ntheir mindsets about stress\nuntil they're asked really.\nThat's been programmed in\nthrough our upbringing,\nthrough public health\nmessages and through media\nand other things.\nAnd it kind of sits there as\nan assumption in the brain,\nand the brain is then figuring out\nhow should it respond to this situation?\nAnd if the assumption, the default,\nthe programming is, stress is bad,\nthat's going to, through\nour subconscious trigger,\nall the things that's like,\nokay, well, I need to rev up\nthe things that protect me\nversus rev up the things\nthat help me grow.\nAnd so, that's at least\nhow I think about it.\nAnd what's cool about it is that,\nbecause it operates as a sort of portal,\nit communicates with more\nsubconscious physiological processes,\nbut it can also be accessed\nthrough our consciousness, right?\nSo just talking about this, right?\nFor your listeners, they're now invited\nto bring their stress mindsets\nup to the consciousness\nand say, what is my stress mindset?\nHow am I thinking about stress?\nCan I reprogram that?\nCan I start to think about\nit as more enhancing?\nThat takes a little bit of a\nconscious work potentially,\nbut then once you do that,\nthat can kind of operate\nin the background,\ninfluencing how your body responds\nand you don't have to\nsay, okay, I'm stressed,\nI better tell my anabolic hormones.\n- Right, right.\n- That doesn't work that way.\n- No.\n- But these mindsets can help\nwith the translational process.\n- I love the idea that\nmindsets are at the interface\nbetween the conscious and subconscious.\nAnd I think there's a lot to unpack there.\nBut it clearly is the\ncase, that the mindset,\nthey sort of act as heuristics, right?\nAnd as we talked about earlier,\nthey can limit what the\nnumber of things to focus on.\nBecause one thing that is really stressful\nis trying to focus on\neverything all the time.\nI've been trying to\nnavigate the public health\naround anything.\nThe public health\ninformation around anything\nit's kind of overwhelming.\nAs you mentioned for stress,\nyou see a lot in the\nstresses will crush you,\nand then you can also find evidence\nthat stress will grow you.\nHow should we, the\nlisteners, think about stress\nand what's the most adaptive\nway to think about stress?\nAnd should we talk about our stress?\nShould we not talk about our stress?\nIs there a short list\nof ways that we can\ncope with stress better?\n- Yeah.\n- I should be careful with the word cope.\nIs there a way that we can\nleverage stress to our advantage?\n- Great, yeah, and that's\nan important nuance\nin your language, which\npeople have by and large\ncome from a place of how\ndo you manage stress?\nHow do you cope with it?\nWhich implies, how do you\nfight against it, right?\n- Vacation, massages, yoga classes.\n- Fight against or check\nout from it, right?\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- And yeah, the real challenge\nis, how do we leverage it?\nHow do we utilize it?\nHow do we work with it?\nAnd yeah, I have a lot\nof thoughts on this.\nThe first and most important thing\nis to clarify our definition of stress.\nSo I think people often associate--\nThe negative stress\nmindset is so insidious,\nthat now people define stress\nwith its negative consequences.\nSo the first step is to decouple that,\nand to realize that stress\nis a neutral, right?\nYet to be determined effect\nof experiencing or anticipating adversity\nin your goal related efforts.\nSo let me unpack that a little more,\nyou can be in the midst of it,\nor you could just be worried\nabout something happening.\nThat's one aspect.\nSecond is, adversity or challenge,\nor something that's working against you.\nBut the third piece is critical,\nand that is in your goal related efforts.\nWhat that means is that,\nwe only stress about things we care about,\nthings that matter to us.\nSo this is really important, right?\nBecause stress is linked with,\nit's the other side of the coin\nof things we care about, right?\nAnd so, I think that's the\nfirst thing to realize, right?\nThat as humans, we stress because we care,\nand we don't stress about\nthings we don't care about.\nSo the simplified\nexample I like to use is,\nyou know, if Johnny was failing school,\nthat wouldn't stress you out,\nunless Johnny was your\nson or you were Johnny,\nor you really cared about\neducating the Johnny's\nof the world, right?\nIt only becomes stressful\nto the extent that you care about it.\nSo, why are we trying to fight or run away\nor hide or merely cope with our stress\nor overcome it through our massages,\nwhen the stress is connected\nto the things we care about.\nSo then the question becomes,\nokay, if that's true,\nhow can I better utilize or leverage\nor respond to the inevitable stresses\nthat we're going to experience?\nI'm not saying go out\nand seek out more stress.\nWhat I am saying is that, you're\ngoing to experience stress\nif you have any cares\nor values or passions\nand most all of us do.\nAnd so, then what do you do?\nAnd we've developed a three-step approach\nto adopting a stresses enhancing mindset,\nand briefly, the first step\nis to just acknowledge\nthat you're stressed,\nto own it, see it, be mindful of it.\nThe second step is to welcome it.\nWhy would you welcome it?\nYou welcome it because\ninherently in that stress\nis something you care about.\nSo you're using it as an opportunity\nto reconnect to what is\nit that I care about here?\nAnd then the third step is to\nutilize the stress response,\nto achieve the thing that you care about,\nnot spend your time,\nmoney, effort, energy,\ntrying to get rid of the stress.\nDoes that make sense?\n- Makes sense and I love it.\nAs somebody who's laboratory studies,\nthe physiological effects of stress,\nthe effects that impressed me the most\nare for instance, the\nnarrowing of visual attention,\nthat it then drives a capacity\nto pass time more finely,\nwhich then drives the capacity\nto process information faster.\nIt's almost like a superpower.\n- Right.\n- And yes, it can feel\nuncomfortable often,\nbut I love the idea\nthat, acknowledging it,\nembracing it and then\nunderstanding its power\nand leveraging that power.\nI think what I like so\nmuch about that framework\nis that the stress\nresponse is very generic.\nUnlike the relaxation response,\nwe don't actually have to\ntrain up the stress response.\nSo we all kind of get this as a freebie.\nAnd then it sounds like it's a question\nof what we end up doing with that.\n- Right, and Hans Selye,\nfather of stress said himself,\nit's a nonspecific response, right?\nSo it occurs, it's what\nyou're doing with it.\nIt's how you're channeling it.\nAnd yeah, like we talked about before,\nwhat most people do is they\nstress about the stress,\nwhich then over exacerbates it,\nor they check out from the stress,\nwhich leads to depression and anhedonia.\nBecause by checking out from stress,\nyou're also checking out from\nthe things we care about.\n- And substance abuse.\n- Exactly.\n- Our colleague Anna\nLembke, who also we had\nthe good fortune\nof having as a guest on this podcast,\ntalked a lot about this.\nI mean, so much of substance abuse,\nbecause she runs the addiction clinic\nover on the med side of campus.\nIt takes over people's lives\nbecause of this increased stability\nto find a solution to the stress,\nthat then eventually\nbecomes its own stressor\nand its own problem.\nWell, I love that mindset and framework.\nI'd love for you to tell us just a bit\nabout what you're up to right now,\nand what's most exciting to you now.\nIf you are able or willing to talk\nabout some of the work that's on the way.\nI saw a brief mention\nof something on your publications website\nof a paper about influencers,\nonline influencers and nutrition.\nNow, that might not be the main\nthrust of what you're up to,\nbut if you're able to tell us about it,\nsort of interesting given that\na lot of the communication\nin and around this podcast takes\nplace through social media.\nAnd I've kind of launched\ninto this landscape now\nwhere constantly bombarded\nwith health information\nand influencers, right?\nAt the time I didn't even know\nuntil couple of [mumbles].\n- You are one.\n- One could argue one way or the other,\nbut what is the deal with influencers?\nAre they doing something\ngood for health information\nor are they ruining the landscape?\nAnd don't try and protect my feelings.\n'Cause I now know that\nstress is actually an asset.\n- Yeah, well, that work\nis part of a body of work\nthat we've been sort of venturing into,\nwhich is to understand\nwhere do these mindsets come from, right?\nAnd I mentioned sort of\npublic health entities\nas one source of, say our\nmindsets about stress.\nBut I think that our mindsets\nare influenced by four different sources.\nFirst is our upbringing, how\nour parents talked about,\nthings like when we're stressed\nor food or other things.\nSecond is culture and media.\nSo movies, podcasts, and now social media.\nThird is influential others.\nSo what doctors say to us\nor close friends or peers.\nAnd fourth is your conscious choice.\nSo, we talked about that a little.\nWe have as humans have the\nability to be mindful of,\nand to change our mindsets.\nBut the social media and influencer stuff\nhas been in part in attempt to understand\nwhere do our mindsets\nabout things like healthy foods come from.\nAnd Brad Turnwald, who was a\nformer grad student in my lab\nhas done a series of really\ninteresting studies on this,\nshowing that, if you rate\nthe nutritional quality\nof the top grossing movies\nin the last 20 years,\nor you look at the Instagram accounts\nof all the most influential\npeople on Instagram,\nand you analyze the nutrition content\nof what they're eating,\nwhat he's shown is that,\ndepending on the study,\n70 to 90% of those movies or influencers\nwould fail the legal standards\nfor advertising in the UK.\nSo they're putting out\ntheir nutrition contents\nthat are, maybe not surprisingly,\nbut undeniably unhealthy.\nAnd to me, that's\ninteresting and important.\nIt shows that where are\nwe getting this mindset\nthat those unhealthy foods\nare pleasurable, desirable.\nWhat's maybe even more\ninteresting than that\nis some of the work that he\nand others in our lab have done\nto show that the ways people are talking\nabout the foods they're\neating really matter too.\nSo generally what we've found is that\nwhen people talk about unhealthy foods,\nthey use a language that\nconnotes a sense of excitement,\nfun, sexiness, danger, indulgence,\nbasically anything good\nand desirable, right?\n- These should be cookies,\ncakes, high sugar.\n- Exactly, like truly unhealthy foods.\nThat's actually--\nThe objective, what?\nHelped me is it's challenging,\nbut yeah, high fat, high sugar.\n- Yeah, I think there's\npretty good agreement now\nthat excessive sugar isn't good.\n- Yeah, and highly processed.\n- Yeah, highly processed,\net cetera, et cetera.\nI think there's general consensus.\nI'm sure someone will--\nIf you're going to come\nafter anyone come after me,\nI'll stand behind [mumbles].\n- But on the other hand, when\npeople are talking about,\nif they do, which, you know, healthy foods\naren't portrayed in media,\nthey aren't portrayed by\ninfluencers rarely ever.\nAnd when they are,\nthey're often talked about\nwith language that conveys\na sense of deprivation.\nIt's nutritious, but it's\nsort of boring, it's bland.\nIt's not tasty.\n- Recovering\nfrom the holidays.\nSort of the post-holiday reset, right?\n- Exactly, and this is really important\nbecause you're doing all this work trying,\nand others are doing all this work,\ntrying to inform people\nabout what actually is good for them.\nAnd meanwhile, there's this\nhurricane of other force\nthat's telling people,\nthat seeping in our minds,\nsure, those might be good for you,\nbut those foods are not\nfun or sexy or indulgent\nor desirable in any way,\nshape or form, right?\nAnd it's also paid\nadvertising for fast foods\nand sugary beverages and other things.\nSo it's not surprising\nthat we have this mindset,\nthat healthy foods are the\nless desirable thing to eat\nbecause of those cultural\nand social forces.\nWhat our work has just tried\nto do is to reveal that,\nquantify it, as a way to say,\nall right, let's maybe be\na little bit more mindful\nabout how we talk about healthy foods.\nIf you're a movie producer,\ncan you be a little bit more mindful\nto showcase healthy and delicious foods\nand have the characters talk about them\nin ways that are more appealing?\nThere's a lot of room for\npeople who produce this content\nto have an impact, not\njust on what people do,\nbut what they think about\nthe foods they're eating.\n- It's really interesting.\nI hadn't thought about it until now,\nbut it makes sense that\nany food that's packaging\ncan be sold as, can be woven into a film\nor promoted by a celebrity influencer,\nnot a health influencer per se,\nbut a celebrity influencer\nbecause they'll get paid, right?\nIt's part of the ecosystem\nthat allows them an income\nand it feeds back on sales to the company.\nWhereas things that can't be commoditized,\nit's more difficult, right?\nIt's hard to the whoever makes\noranges and sells oranges\nis unlikely to promote\noranges in a celebrity post\nor in a movie because\noranges can be purchased\nfrom many, many sources.\nThat there's no identifiable\nsource of oranges\nas there is with a packaged\nfood, for instance.\n- Yeah, but the interesting\nthing we found in those studies\nis that it wasn't driven\nby promoted content\nor branded content.\nThere was some of that certainly,\nand yeah, all of the\npromoted and branded content\nis usually for processed high sugar foods.\nBut 90% or more of these\nfoods that they were showing\nwere not promoted or branded.\nAnd so, there's a lot of flexibility\nin what these producers or influencers\ncould show on their media.\nAlthough it goes both ways, right?\nIt's not just the producers\nand the influencers\nresponsibility, the public\nis reacting to this.\nAnd we showed too that people\nrespond more positively,\nthere are more likes on\nposts about unhealthy foods.\nSo it's a sort of\ndistasteful and in neck it,\nyou know, it's a distasteful\nculture around healthy eating\nand we really have a\nlot to do to change it.\n- Yeah, it's dopamine\ncircuits through and through,\njust the site of some very calorie dense,\nextremely tasty food drives\nthose dopamine circuits.\nAnd I realized that there\nare people out there\nwho derive the same sort of,\nor similar levels of\npleasure from healthy foods.\nAnd that's a wonderful thing\nif one can accomplish that.\nSo we just need more of that,\nis what it's sounds like.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nAnd that's what's really inspiring.\nTo me at least, is that,\nit is possible, right?\nI mean, people think, oh, well,\nvegetables are just inherently\nless tasty than ice cream.\nAnd it's like, well, that's\nnot necessarily true.\nAlso it doesn't have to\nbe a competition, right?\nI don't have to get my\nthree-year-old to hate ice cream\nin order for it her like broccoli.\nThere's a lot more I can be doing\nto help shape a more\npositive approach oriented,\nindulgent mindset around\nhealthy, nutritious vegetables\nand fruits and other foods, right?\nIn addition to having her\nlike ice cream, right?\nAnd that's totally fine.\n- So, it's a really interesting study.\nWhen it's published, let me know and all.\n- Yeah, I think it was actually\nreleased this week, yeah.\nIn JAMA Internal Medicine.\n- JAMA Internal, okay, great journal.\nI will definitely talk\nabout it on social media\nand elsewhere, sounds very interesting.\nWhat else are you up to lately?\nMy favorite question to ask\nany scientist or colleague\nby the way, is what are you\nmost excited about lately?\nWhat are you up late thinking about\nand getting up early thinking about?\n- Yeah, so hands down, the\nthing I'm most [mumbles],\nwell, I guess there's so many things.\nThe thing that I'm most into right now,\nwe're doing the most work in is, you know,\nI started by getting\ninspired by placebo effects\nin medicine.\nI did a long stint in placebo\nor belief like effects\nin behavioral health.\nAnd now we're moving back into medicine.\nSo I'm really interested\nin looking at how we can\nwork with active drugs\nand treatments, to make them better\nand make the experience of them better\nby instilling different mindsets.\nSo, one study we did along those lines,\nwe worked with kids\nor undergoing treatment\nfor food allergies.\nSo allergies to peanuts, for example,\nthis was with Kari Nadeau,\nwho's the head of the\nStanford Allergy Center here.\nShe has a great treatment\nfor food allergies.\nBasically kids take\ngradually increasing doses\nof the thing they're\nallergic to, like peanuts.\nAnd over the course of\nsix or seven months,\nthese kids become less\nreactive to peanuts.\nAnd the problem with that\ntreatment is it's really difficult\nbecause they're having all\nsorts of negative symptoms\nand side effects.\nThese kids are getting itchy\nmouths and upset stomach,\nthey're puking and it's scary,\nbecause they're literally eating the thing\nthat they've been told\nmight kill them, right?\nAnd what we did in the study,\nwas we attempted to improve the experience\nand outcomes of that,\nby reframing mindsets\nabout the symptoms and the side effects.\nSo as it was being conducted before,\nthe kids were told,\nlook, these side effects\nare just an unfortunate\nby-product of this treatment,\nand you have to sort of\nendure them to get through it.\nBut what we found in our\nconversation with Kari,\nwas that the reality of those side effects\nwas not so negative.\nIn fact, they were mechanistically linked\nto the body learning\nhow to tolerate peanuts\nor the allergen.\nAnd so what we did was\nwe worked within a trial.\nThey were all getting the treatment,\nbut half of them were helped to see\nthis more positive mindsets.\nThat symptoms and side\neffects from this treatment,\nwere a positive signal that\nthe treatment was working\nand their bodies were getting stronger.\nAnd what we found was that\nthat mindset led to reductions\nin anxiety, fewer symptoms,\nwhen at the highest doses and\nmost interestingly of all,\nthey had better outcomes.\nSo based on immune markers,\nthat were assign of\nthe allergic tolerance,\nthose who had this mindset throughout\nhad better outcomes to the treatment.\nSo that's just one example.\nI think, my goal is really to move us\nbeyond the placebo versus\ndrug, mindset versus behavior,\nto get to a place where\nwe can blend them together\nand maximize the benefit\nof these treatments.\nSo we're doing a lot of studies like that,\nyou know, how can we\nimprove treatment for cancer\nwith different mindsets?\nWe've done some work recently\nwith the COVID-19 vaccine,\nand symptoms and side effects.\nSo that's what I'm really\npassionate about right now.\n- It's incredible.\nI can't wait to read that study.\nIs that one out or on the way?\n- Yes.\n- Okay, well then I will also\nread and communicate with you\nand then about that.\nSo who knows, maybe you\nwould come on Instagram\nand do a little Instagram live\nto make sure that I don't\nscrew up the delivery\nand that we can hear it direct\nfrom the person who ran the study.\nI find this issue of side\neffects really interesting.\nI don't take a lot of prescription drugs,\nbut recently I was prescribed a few,\nand the list of side\neffects is, it's incredible\nand it just goes on and on and on.\nI realize some of that\nis legal protections.\nIt's hard for me to believe\nthat they're actually\nexpecting anyone to read those\nbecause you need a high powered\nmicroscope to read this,\nprint is truly fine print.\nBut I did realize that in\nreading over the side effects\nthat one prime is themselves,\nto experience those side effects.\nAnd so now I just rip up\nthe side effects thing\nor the sheet, and just throw it away.\nI just take it as recommended.\nDo you think it works\nin the other direction\nto where if an effective medication\nis supposed to have result A, B or C,\nand you are told again and again,\nhow effective it is for that treatment,\nthat it could amplify the effect.\nSo in other words, it's\nstrictly a placebo.\nIt's not nocebo, as you described before.\nBut that perhaps at a lower dose,\na given medication could\nhave a amplified effect\nor at a appropriate dose, if you will,\nit could have a super\nphysiological effect.\nHas that ever been demonstrated?\n- To some degree.\nI think where it gets\ntricky is, for a long time,\npeople thought the effects of placebos\nwere expectancy based.\nSo you expect to get a benefit\nand that benefit occurs.\nThere's certainly some,\nsome truth to that,\nbut I think the mindset\napproach is more powerful\nbecause it helps us understand\nthe mechanisms, right?\nSo if you just expect that your\nblood pressure will go down,\nwhat are the mechanisms\nthrough which that expectation\nwould lead to your blood\npressure going down way?\nIt's hard to even understand that, right?\nBut if you have the mindset\nthat, you're in good hands,\nthat this is being taken care of,\nthat this illness is not\ngoing to kill you, right?\nThat you're being treated well.\nThen you can start to\nunpack the mechanisms\nthrough which blood\npressure could be relieved.\nMaybe it's anxiety reduction,\nmaybe it's changing the\nsort of anticipation\nof what are the prioritization\nof what the body needs to focus on.\nAnd so, I really think\nthat, the work of the future\nneeds to be on getting\nmore sophisticated about\nwhat is the mindset that we're instilling\nwhen we say something will\nwork or it won't work.\nAnd how do we understand the mechanisms\nthrough which that changes physiology?\nSo to answer your question,\nI think that that could be true,\nbut it depends on what\nactually is the mindset\nyou're evoking.\n- I know you're a parent,\nand to the other parents out there,\nbut also the kids and\npeople who don't have kids,\nwhat is the best way to\nlearn and teach mindsets?\nI mean, clearly a conversation\nlike this informs me\nand many other people\nout there about mindsets\nand how we can adopt them.\nBut it also seems to me\nthat if we have the\nopportunity to teach mindsets\nand really cultivate certain mindsets,\nthat the world will be\na much better place.\n- Yes.\n- How does one go about that?\nGiven that there were kids\nand we are all being bombarded\nwith conflicting information all the time,\nhow do we anchor to a mindset?\n- Yeah, and you're getting\nat my other major passion\nright now, which is what\nwe're calling in our lab,\nmeta mindset.\nI'm working on this with\nChris Evans and others.\nAnd that is, how do we\nconsciously and deliberately\nchange our mindsets?\nAnd the first step is really simple,\nand that's just to be\naware that you have them.\nThat the world, your beliefs,\naren't sort of an unmitigated\nreflection of reality\nas it objectively is.\nThey are filtered through\nour interpretations,\nour expectations, our frameworks,\nand simplifications of that reality.\nAnd as you know, your work\nand then you're as you know,\nso well that most of\nwhat goes on in our brain\nis an interpretation of reality.\nMindsets are just the\nsimplified core assumptions\nabout things.\nAnd the first step is to\nrealize that we have them.\nThe second step is to\nstart to think about,\nwhat the effects of those\nmindsets are on your life\nto sort of play out the story, right?\nOkay, I have this mindset\nthat stress is debilitating.\nHow is that making me feel?\nWhat is that leading me to do?\nIs this mindset helpful or harmful?\nThe question isn't is the\nmindset right or wrong?\nBecause you can find\nevidence for her against it.\nWe can fight about it\nuntil we're exhausted.\nThe question is, is it helpful or harmful?\nAnd then, you can go\nabout seeking out ways\nto adopt more useful mindsets.\nSo, we've been doing a lot of work\non how to actually do that.\nHow do you consciously change it?\nSometimes it's really simple.\nI think in cases\nwhere we don't have a\nlot of prior experience,\nlike the kids with allergies\nwho are getting treatment,\nthey didn't have any other\nmindsets about symptoms.\nSo we just had the luxury\nof setting it, right?\nWhen it comes to healthy food,\nI think it's harder to\nchange people's mindsets\nbecause we have a lot of\nbaggage weighing us down.\nAs a parent, for me,\nI guess my number one piece\nof advice is to lighten up,\ntrying to get your kids\nto do certain things\nand focus more on helping them to adopt\nmore adaptive mindsets.\nSo, I'm by no means an expert at this,\nbut I'm testing it with my own child.\n- Your child real, real child.\nThe real kind of experiment.\n- It's how do I resist the urge\nto force my child to eat her dinner\nso that she can have her dessert, right?\nBecause that's the real urge.\nIt's like, no, you need\n- Or you're negotiating.\n- to do that.\nBecause when you start thinking about it\nin terms of mindset, you realize, oh,\nthat's just reinforcing to her,\nthat the dessert is the\nexciting, fun thing to have.\nAnd this thing that I have\nto do must be horrible.\nSo horrible that my parent is\nforcing me to do it, right?\nSo it's letting go a\nlittle bit of the behavior,\nthe objective reality,\nand really thinking about\nthe subjective reality\nand focusing on adaptive mindsets.\nSo my goal as a parent\nhas been to try to help her\ninstill a healthy mindset\nabout eating,\nthat healthy foods are\nindulgent and delicious.\nThat the experience of\nstress is inevitable,\nthat it's natural.\nAnd that going through\nstressful experience\ncan help her learn, grow,\nand become a more connected\nand happier individual.\nAnd with exercise and physical activity,\nwe haven't really gotten to that yet,\nbut [laughs] we will with time.\n- Yeah, that's great.\nI wrote down\nand I'm going to keep this\nin the front of my mind,\ngoing forward, to continually ask\nwhat is the effect of my mindset about X?\nAnd just to evaluate that.\nAbout exercise, about food,\nabout school, about stress,\nabout relationships,\nabout relationship to self, et cetera.\nAnd to really think about\nthat in a series of layers\nthat you think that would\nbe a useful exercise?\n- Definitely, and you know,\nand your work speaks to this.\nI mean, the mindful, it's not--\nI would really urge against\npeople getting dogmatic\nabout their mindset also, right?\nLike, oh, I need to\nhave the right mindset.\nOr, and if I don't have the right mind--\nIt's like, okay, mindset\nis a piece of the puzzle.\nIt's a piece of the puzzle\nthat's really empowering\nbecause we have access to\nit and we can change it.\nBut it is just one piece of a puzzle.\nSo treat yourself like a\nscientist, look at your life,\nlook at your mindsets,\nsee what's serving you,\nsee what isn't.\nFind more useful, adaptive,\nand empowering mindsets\nand live by those.\n- I love it.\nNow, in one version of\nthis kind of discussion,\nI would have asked\nthe question I'm going to\nask next at the beginning,\nbut I'm going to ask it\nnow close to the end,\nwhich is, you're unique\nconstellation of accomplishments\nand attributes, and I only know\na subset of them, of course,\nbecause today's the first\ntime that we've met in person,\neven though I've known\nyour work for a long time\nand we're colleagues across campus.\nSo you run your laboratory,\nwhere you do research.\nYou were also an athlete in\nuniversity, a serious athlete,\nand then you're also a clinical\npsychologist, is that right?\n- I was trained as a\nclinical psychologist.\nSo my PhD is in clinical psychology.\nAnd I did all my pre and post internships\nthat dealt with stress and trauma.\n- Do you see patients or did\nyou see patients at that time?\n- I did.\nYes, I don't anymore.\n- Okay, that's a very unique constellation\nof practitioner and researcher.\nSo what are the mindsets\nthat you try and adopt\non a regular basis in as a consequence\nor in relation to those things,\nsort of athlete, researcher, clinician?\nFor yourself as you move through life,\ndo you have an overarching mindset\nthat all challenge's good,\nor do you have any kind\nof central mindsets\nthat help you navigate through,\nyou know, it was passed\nto be a pretty complex\nset of daily routines\ngiven everything that you juggle.\nBut I think that people\nlike you are unique,\nin that you have the inside knowledge\nof how this stuff works,\nand you've also existed in\nthese different domains.\nAnd I know a lot of listeners\nhave a more athletic slant to their life\nor a more cognitive or\nsome are raising kids,\nor some people are doing\nany number of things.\nSo, this is where I\nthink it would be useful\nfor people to hear kind\nof, what do you do?\nThis is what I'm asking.\n- Yeah, well, it's\ncertainly true in my case,\nthat research is me search.\nEverything that I study as an intellectual\nhas come from my own experience\nor my own failings, right?\nAnd when I was really intensely\nexercising and training,\nthose were the questions I asked\nwhen I was dealing with eating\nand concerns about my weight,\nthose were the questions I asked.\nWhen I was stressed about my dissertation.\nI decided to do my\ndissertation on stress, right?\nNow I think we're in the\nmidst of a global pandemic.\nHow can our mindsets be useful here?\nI don't think there's a\nobvious answer to your question\nother than the guiding light for me\nhas been an undercurrent of understanding\nthat our mindsets matter.\nI think I got that very\nclearly and deeply as a child,\nboth through my experiences as an athlete.\nI know many of you listeners are athletes.\nAny athlete knows that you\ncan be the same physical being\nfrom one day to the next\none moment to the next,\nand perform completely differently,\njust depending on what you're thinking.\nI was a gymnast growing up.\nAnd if you can't visualize,\nif you can't see something in your mind\nthen you have no chance\nwhen you get up there on\nthe balance beam, right?\nAnd also, my father was a martial artist,\na teacher of meditation.\nSo this kind of mind body work\nwas baked into me from an early age.\nAnd I think what I've done recently,\nis to try to understand it scientifically,\nand more importantly,\nto figure out how can we\ndo better with this, right?\nWe're all talking about\nAI taking over the world,\nand technology this and all\nthe personalized medicine that,\nand it's like, we have\ndone so little, relatively,\nso little with the human\nresource, our human brains,\nthat the potential for which is so great.\nAnd we've done almost nothing.\nTake the placebo effect, we\nknow a lot about what it is.\nWe've done almost nothing\nto leverage that in medicine\nconsciously and deliberately.\nSo, what keeps me going, what\ngets me through the hard times\nis just that burning question\nof, what is going on here\nand what more can I do\nwith the power of my mind?\n- Well, I and millions of\nother people are so grateful\nthat you do this work.\nIt's so important and it's truly unique.\nTell us where people can learn\nmore about your research,\nwhere they can find you online.\nI'm going to try and persuade you\nto take more of a social\nmedia presence going forward.\nBut whether or not I succeed\nin that effort or not,\nwhere can people find you, ask\nquestions, find your papers,\nlearn more.\nI'd love to have you back for\na conversation in the future,\nbut in the meantime.\n- Yeah, it's been such an\nhonor getting to chat with you\nand just you have such\nan impact on the world.\nAnd I look forward.\nI hope we can do some\nscience together also.\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\n- Yeah, all our papers and\nmaterials and interventions\nare housed on our\nwebsite, mbl.stanford.edu.\nWe also have a link there too,\nthat takes you to Stanford SPARK,\nwhich stands for social\npsychological answers\nto real world questions.\nWe have a lot of toolkits on that website,\nincluding a toolkit for\nthis rethink stress approach\nof acknowledging, welcoming,\nand utilizing your stress.\nAnd then I guess I'm on\nTwitter, Alia Crum, [chuckles],\nI don't do much there,\nbut maybe I will start to.\n- Well, those are all great resources.\nWe will provide links to all of those\nfor our listeners and viewers.\nAnd I also hope to convince you\nto write a book or many\nbooks in the future.\nThe world needs to know about this,\nbut thank you so much for taking time\nout of your exceedingly busy schedule\nto talk to us about these ideas.\nI learned so much.\nI'm going to definitely think about\nwhat is the effect of\nmy mindset about blank\nin every category of life\nand really, on behalf\nof everybody and myself.\nThank you so much.\n- Yeah, thank you.\nAnd I guess I just want to end by saying,\nI think this work is really\nthe tip of the iceberg\nof what can and should be done.\nAnd so, I really invite\nyou, your listeners,\nand anybody who's inspired by this work.\nIf they want to share stories\nor want to partner on a\ncollaboration to please reach out.\n- Great, well, and the\ncomments section on YouTube\nis a great place to do that as well.\nYou will hear from them.\n- Great, [laughs].\n- All right.\nThank you so much, Allie.\n- Thank you.\n- Thank you for joining\nme for my conversation\nwith Dr. Alia Crum.\nI'm guessing by now, you can appreciate\nthe enormous impact that mindsets have\non our biology and our psychology,\nand how those interact at\nthe level of mind and body.\nIf you'd like to learn\nmore about Dr. Crum's work,\nand perhaps even be a research subject\nin one of their upcoming\nstudies on mindsets,\nyou can go to mbl.stanford.edu.\nThere, you will also\nsee a tab for support,\nwhere if you like, you can\nmake a tax deductible donation\nto support the incredible research\nthat Dr. Crum and her\ncolleagues are doing.\nIf you're learning from and are enjoying\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please subscribe\nto us on Apple and Spotify.\nAnd on Apple, you have the opportunity\nto leave us up to a five star review.\nOn YouTube, you also have the opportunity\nto leave us questions and\ncomments in the comment section\nbelow any of the episodes.\nYou can also make suggestions\nabout future guests\nthat you'd like us to host\non the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nPlease also check out our sponsors\nmentioned at the\nbeginning of this episode,\nthat's the best way to\nsupport this podcast.\nWe also have a Patreon, it's\npatreon.com/andrewhuberman,\nand there you can support the podcast\nat any level that you like.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing us on Instagram\nand on Twitter, we are Huberman Lab\nat both Instagram and Twitter,\nand there I teach\nneuroscience in short form,\nsometimes videos, sometimes texts, slides.\nSome of that information\noverlaps with what you\nfind on the podcast.\nSome of it is distinct from\nwhat you find on the podcast.\nOn previous episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI often discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary or used by everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them.\nAn important consideration\nwhen using supplements\nis that they be sourced from\nthe highest quality sources.\nFor that reason, we partner\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.\nBecause Thorne supplements\nuse the highest quality ingredients\nand the greatest degree of precision,\nin terms of what's listed on the bottle\nis actually what you will\nfind in their products.\nAnd that is not true for\nall supplement companies.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorn, that\nT-H-O-R-N-E.com/U/Huberman,\nand you can get 20% off\nany of those supplements.\nIn addition, if you navigate\ninto the Thorne site\nthrough that portal,\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIn closing, I'd like\nto thank you once again\nfor joining me for my\ndiscussion about mindsets\nwith Dr. Alia Crum,\nand as always, thank you for\nyour interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
