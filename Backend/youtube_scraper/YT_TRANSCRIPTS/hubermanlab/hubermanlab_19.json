    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Casey\nmeans Dr Casey means did her\nundergraduate degree at Stanford\nUniversity and her medical degree at\nStanford University School of Medicine\nshe is one of the world's foremost\nexperts in metabolic Health today we\ndiscuss how metabolic function and\ndysfunction impacts our health in\nparticular we discuss mitochondria which\nare involved in energy production within\nour cells and the various things that we\ncan each and all do to ensure proper\nmitochondrial function which is\nessential not just for things like body\ncomposition and physical and mental\nenergy but also our ability to regulate\nhormones blood sugar and much more we\ndiscuss how exercise even simple\nexercise like walking as well as sleep\nas well as more vigorous exercise and in\nparticular nutrition including the types\nof foods we eat the timing of food\nintake and the sources and quality of\nthose Foods impact are mitochondria and\nother aspects of metabolic function we\nalso discuss how particular\nmicronutrients within specific foods can\ndirectly impact mitochondrial and\nmetabolic Health Dr means explains how\nmitochondria inflammation and reactive\noxygen species which are the byproducts\nof metabolism in our cells can combine\nto create conditions of obesity as well\nas ways that we can manage those things\nor even reverse mitochondrial\ninflammation and reactive oxygen species\ndysfunction in order to reverse obesity\nreverse diabetes and enhance our health\nin Myriad Ways by the end of today's\ndiscussion you'll have a clear picture\nof the cellular processes that occur in\nthe brain and body that underly\nmetabolic disease and metabolic health\nand most importantly you'll have a very\nclear picture of the actionable items\nthat we can each and all carry out every\nday and every week in order to ensure\nmetabolic Health proper mitochondrial\nfunction and indeed that can also\nbody composition and overall feelings of\nwell-being I would also like to share\nthat Dr Casey means has a terrific new\nbook coming out I know it's terrific\nbecause I've read it it is entitled good\nenergy the surprising connection between\nmetabolism and Limitless Health if\nyou're interested in the book we\nprovided a link to the book in the show\nnote captions before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science Rel tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is Maui Nei\nvenon Maui Nei venison is the most\nnutrient-dense and delicious red meat\navailable I've spoken before on this\npodcast and with several expert guests\non this podcast about the fact that most\nof us should be seeking to get about one\ngram of quality protein per pound of\nbody weight every day not only does that\nprotein provide critical building blocks\nfor things like muscle repair and\nsynthesis but also for overall\nmetabolism and health eating enough\nquality protein each day is also a\nterrific way to saave off hunger one of\nthe key things however is to make sure\nthat you're getting enough quality\nprotein without ingesting excess\ncalories mauii venison has an extremely\nhigh quality protein per calorie ratio\nsuch that getting one gram of protein\nper pound of body weight is both easy\nand doesn't cause you to ingest an\nexcess of calories also Maui Nei venison\nis absolutely delicious they have\nvenison steaks they have ground venison\nand they have ven bone broth I\npersonally like all of those in fact I\nprobably eat a Maui Nei venison Burger\npretty much every day and occasionally\nI'll swap that for a Maui Nei steak and\nif you're really on the go they have\nMaui Nei venison jerky which has 10 gram\nof protein per stick at just 55 calories\nif you'd like to try Maui Nei venison\nyou can go to mauii venison\ndocomo to get 20% off your first order\nagain that's mauw venison\ndocomo today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by eight sleep eight sleep makes\nSmart mattress covers with cooling\nHeating and sleep tracking capacity now\nI've spoken many times before in this\npodcast about the critical need to get\nsleep both enough sleep and enough\nquality sleep when we do that everything\nour mental health our physical health\nperformance in any sports or School Etc\nall get better and when we're not\nsleeping well or enough all those things\nsuffer one of the key things to getting\na great night's sleep is that your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3° in order to fall and stay\ndeeply asleep and in order to wake up\nfeeling feeling refresh your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° one of the best ways to\nensure that happens is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand with eight sleep it makes it very\neasy to do that you program in the\ntemperature that you want at the\nbeginning middle and end of the night\nyou can even divide the temperature for\ntwo different people if you have two\ndifferent people sleeping in the bed and\nit tracks your sleep it tells you how\nmuch slow wave sleep and rapid eye\nmovement sleep you're getting it really\nhelps you dial in the correct parameters\nto get the best possible night sleep for\nyou I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep\nmattress car for well over 3 years now\nand it has completely transformed my\nsleep for the better if you'd like to\ntry eightsleep you can go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman and save $150 off their pod\nthree cover eight sleep currently ships\nin the USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's eights\nsleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by Aeropress Aeropress is like a\nFrench press but a French press that\nalways Brews the perfect cup of coffee\nmeaning no bitterness and excellent\ntaste Aeropress achieves this because it\nuses a very short contact time between\nthe hot water and the coffee and that\nshort contact time also means that you\ncan brew an excellent cup of coffee very\nquickly the whole thing takes only about\n3 minutes I started using an aero press\nover 10 years ago and I learned about it\nfrom a guy named Alan Adler who's a\nformer Stanford engineer who's also an\ninventor he developed things like the\naobi Frisbee in any event I'm a big fan\nof Adler inventions and when I heard he\ndeveloped a coffee maker the Aro press I\ntried it and I found that indeed it\nmakes the best possible Tas in cup of\ncoffee it's also extremely small and\nportable so I started using it in the\nlaboratory when I travel on the road and\nalso at home and I'm not alone in my\nlove of the Aeropress coffee maker with\nover 55,000 f-star reviews Aeropress is\nthe best reviewed coffee press in the\nworld if you'd like to try Aeropress you\ncan go to Aero press.com huberman to get\n20% off Aeropress currently ships in the\nUSA Canada and to over 60 other\ncountries around the world again that's\nAero\npress.com huberman and now for my\ndiscussion with Dr Casey means Dr Casey\nmeans welcome Dr Andrew hman thank you\nso much for having me really excited to\ntalk to you today about all things\nHealth one of the things I love so much\nabout your work is that you really give\npeople a sense of agency through\nknowledge and actionable tools which is\nvery near and dear to my mission and my\nheart but to kick things off let's talk\nabout metabolic function and dysfunction\nI think most people hear the word\nmetabolism and they think okay the\nburning of energy maybe they think about\nATP maybe they think about calories in\ncalories out that sort of thing but what\nare we talking about when we're talking\nabout metabolic function and dysfunction\nbecause these are really important\nconcepts for everyone to understand yeah\nI think you're exactly right I think\nthat when we hear the word metabolism\nthe first thing that comes to most\npeople's minds is my weight do I have a\nfast metabolism or do I have a slow\nmetabolism or something like basil\nmetabolic rate and I think what's really\nimportant for people to realize is that\nmetabolism is actually the foundation of\nall Health it is the core foundational\npathway that drives all other aspects of\nhealth and it's also the core\nfoundational pathway that's truly\ngetting crushed in the modern American\nWorld and underlying nine of the 10\nleading causes of death in the United\nStates today it's really quite relevant\nto everyone and the spectrum of\nmetabolic rooted disease is vast and\nactually really relevant to most\nAmericans the latest research from\nAmerican College of Cardiology suggests\nthat 93% of American adults have\nsuboptimal metabolism and we can go into\nwhat that means but\nfundamentally when we're talking about\nmetabolism we're talking about how we\nconvert food energy to human energy so\nwe take in a\nastonishing 70 metric tons or so of food\nin our lifetime and that is potential\nenergy it's energy from the environment\nthat's outside of us that through our\nmetabolic pathways gets converted to a\ncurrency of energy that can then be used\nto pay for essentially Every chemical\nreaction inside our body and the\nbubbling up of all of those chemical\nreactions is our lives and so when\nmetabolism is not working properly it's\nessentially creating underpowered cells\nand like any City or factory or machine\nnot having adequate power will lead to\ndysfunction and the reason that the\nmetabolic spectrum of disease is so vast\nis because we have over 200 cell types\nin the body and underpowering in\ndifferent cell types is going to look\nlike different symptoms because\nunderpowering in a asite is going to\nlook different than underpowering an\novarian thica cell or an endothelial\ncell it's going to look different but\nthe core foundational process that is\ndysfunctional can actually be the same\nand I think the biggest blind spot in\nWestern healthc care and actually the\nreason that Health outcomes are actually\ngetting worse every year in the United\nStates is because fundamentally we are\nignoring metabolic health and metabolic\ndysfunction we are laser focused on the\ndownstream symptoms that result from\nmetabolic dysfunction in different cell\ntypes and we spend all of our energy uh\nfocusing on those symptoms playing wacl\nwith them and really ignoring that\nunderlying foundational root cause of\nmetabolic function and what's so\nfascinating to me and what I saw in the\nHealth Care system as like a Super Subs\nspecialist as an ENT surgeon is that you\nknow the more we specialize in health\ncare we have over a hundred Specialties\nnow that we've just like invented in the\nHealth Care System the more we\nspecialize in health care the sicker\nwe're actually getting so the more we do\ntechnological innovation in all these\ndifferent Specialties the sicker we're\ngetting and I think what what the real\nnugget there that that everyone really\nneeds to understand is we've bought into\na system where we value\nspecialization and this is the game in\nWestern medicine but while we've done\nthat what has happened is we have the\nworst chronic disease epidemic and the\nlowest life expectancy of any High\nincome country in the world and the\nreason is because in that specialization\nwere focused on the downstream\nmanifestation of underpowering of cells\nthe the cell specific symptoms and not\nthe metabolic function itself so really\nour chronic disease epidemic in this\ncountry it is a metabolic dysfunction\nepidemic and underpowering epidemic and\nthat is the biggest blind spot in health\ncare and I think a focus on metabolic\nfunction as the center of our health\ncare System it's a completely new\nparadigm for health that is urgently and\nI cannot overs say it enough it's\nurgently needed we know we're not in the\nright Paradigm right now when we have a\nhundred isolated Specialties and yet 85\nto 90% of the conditions in those\nSpecialties if you go to the science and\nlook at the real physiology is metabolic\ndysfunction so that's kind of the\nlandscape of what metabolic dysfunction\nis and how it's kind of creating a a big\nblind spot in the Health Care system\nthat really represents an outdated way\nof categorizing disease that\nunfortunately is killing us I would say\nyeah thank you for that I have um\nseveral Reflections and a question uh\nfirst off the the analogy that comes to\nmind is an assembly line that's\nconstructing let's say an automobile and\nit sounds like 80 to 90% of the\nautomobiles that are coming off that\nassembly line are not working well tires\naren't on line engines isn't working\nwell transmission isn't working a bunch\nof issues\nand no Factory no car manufacturer would\ntolerate that nor would the customers\nbut we're tolerating that in ourselves\nit sounds like many people are and then\naccepting the fact that then a bunch of\nother businesses are going to crop up\nlike the business that aligns the tires\nthe business that goes and repairs the\nPistons and and essentially when you\ntalk about these multi Specialties that\nhave evolved in the in the medical care\nsystem they provide an opportunity to go\nand fix the problems or try and\nameliorate the problems but really what\nwe need to do to make this analogy uh\nmuch briefer than it otherwise would be\nis just to go further up the assembly\nline figure out whether or not the\nhardware is correct the software is\ncorrect and where the hardware and\nsoftware are becoming deficient in this\num in this analogy where we are the\nautomobile that's essentially coming off\nthe conveyor broken and the good news is\nand I know this because I've read your\nbook and because I follow your work very\nclosely the good news is that we each\nand all can take matters to some extent\ninto our own hands collaborate with\nhealthc care providers yeah and repair\nmetabolic dysfunction essentially make\nus metabolically functional so um the\nquestion therefore is I think most\npeople when they hear\nmetabolism they think energy yep and\nwhen we hear energy we think ATP\nsometimes but typically people think\nabout mitochondria right the PowerHouse\nof the cell so to speak um so you've\ntalked about the trifecta or the the big\nthree mitochondria inflammation and\noxidative stress as three critical\nfactors underlying metabolic dysfunction\nand I'm presuming those are also the\nAvenues to address in order to create\nmetabolic function because ultimately\nwhat we want of course is an optimistic\npicture that we can actually take some\ncontrol that we have some agency in all\nof this which I believe we do so if you\nwould could you get us all on the same\npage about you know what are\nmitochondria and what they do why are\nthey so important then we can turn to\ninflammation and oxidative stress yes\nabsolutely so the mitochondria or are\nthe structure within the cells we have\n40 trillion cells and each cell might\nhave a handful or many thousand\nmitochondria and they are the magical\npart of the cell that does that\nconversion process of food breaking down\nuh and then converting to energy to\ntranslating it to a currency of energy\nour body can recognize and So\ncurrently what's happening is that our\nenvironment the environment that our\ncells exist in across every\nsingle facet of our life over the past\n50 to 75 years has changed rapidly you\nlook at how our food system has changed\nfrom whole real food in good soil to\nIndustrial food our sleep habits have\nchanged we're sleeping less it's very\nfragmented our movement patterns have\nchanged we're sitting 80% of the waking\nday our time in nature has changed we\nactually are indoors As Americans 93% of\na 24-hour periods that totally changes\nour relationship with light we have\n80,000 synthetic toxins in our food\nwater air personal care products home\ncare products we live a Thermon neutral\nexistence now with our thermostats\nthere's no real swings in temperature\nunless you're in intentionally trying to\num and then our emotional health is very\ndifferent we are very much exposed to\nlowgrade chronic stress triggers so\nacross food sleep movement emotional\nhealth toxins light and temperature\nthings are not what they once were and\nit's changed in the blink of an eye I\nmean the light bulb was created in 1806\nthis is like 0.04% of human history that\nwe' even had artificial light so things\nhave changed and the the unique thing\nabout all of these Chang in our\nenvironment is that each one of those\npillars each of those changes in our\nenvironment synergistically directly\nhurts the mitochondria through different\nmechanisms The Chronic low-grade stress\nthe sitting the ultr processed nutrient\ndevoid food even the the blue light at\nnighttime all of it through different\ncore biologic mechanisms synergistically\nhits this part of the cell the\nmitochondria so we have the food coming\nin but we're not doing a a job of\nconverting it to an energy form we can\nuse so we have these underpowered\ndysfunctional cells because of\nmitochondrial dysfunction caused by our\nenvironment and of course what happens\nif you've got energy substrate that you\ncan't process it's going to be stored\nand that's of course why we have an\nobesity and overweight epidemic that's\naffecting close to 80% of American so\nwild it's it's just we talk about\nobesity like it's the problem obesity is\none branch of a tree that that's rooted\nin this\nmitochondrial dysfunction that's caused\nby our environment and just to back up a\nlittle bit to just sort of\nshare kind of maybe like how I sort of\nstarted thinking about that you know I I\nhad trained as an ENT surgeon and I was\nat Stanford Medical School and I I was\nso fascinated by this idea of like the\nway that we're\ndefining the diseases we're treating in\nthese in in like a specialty like ENT is\nlike I I saw sinusitis day in and day\nout and we'd have these patients on the\ntable that we'd be literally drilling\ninto their skulls to suck out sinus pus\nand that's like the treatment for\nsinusitis and the way we diagnose the\npatients is we say like okay this\npatient has\nsinusitis if they have facial pressure\npurulent pus you know nasal discharge um\nnasal obstruction and low sense of smell\nso if they have these symptoms then they\nhave this disease but when you actually\ngo to the science and you actually go to\nthe studies of like what is actually\nhappening to create this what you find\nis a lot of papers about mitochondrial\ndysfunction because Chron you know\nsinusitis is a chronic inflammatory\ncondition where the cells are\nessentially sensing some threat and then\nthey mount this immune response that\ncreates swelling and then you get pus\nbuildup but we confuse the the pus\nbuildup with the disease which is\nactually happening inside the cells and\nso you start looking at PubMed as a as a\nclinician through a slightly different\nlens of like what's actually happening\nin the cells and what you find for\nalmost every chronic disease we're\nseeing in the US is that you will find a\nlot of papers on how the mitochondria\nare dysfunctional lower ATP generation\nin a lot of these cell types and then\nwhat does that do and this gets your\nquestion about chronic inflammation oxa\nof stress well when you've got that\ndysfunctional mitochondria let's say in\na nasal mucosal tissue that is a cell\nthat can't do its job that is a cell\nthat's underpowered and what could be\nmore threatening to the body than a cell\nthat can't do its job so interestingly\nthose cells will initiate a whole\nprocess which is called the cell danger\nresponse um it's work that's been done\nby Robert navio at uh\nUCSD where basically they understand the\nmitochondria is not working properly\nthis is of course caused by the\nenvironment and they will actually\nrelease extracellular ATP which is not\nreally supposed to go outside of the\ncell and that creates a massive innate\nimmune response saying like I'm\nunderpowered I need help my mitochondria\nis broken this is the cell releases ATP\noutside of the cell usually the\nconcentration of ATP is a million times\nhigher inside the cell so releases it\nalmost as a neurotransmitter a purogen\nneurotransmitter that massively\nactivates the immune system to come and\nhelp but the immune system comes and is\nlike not much we can do for you here\nbecause the problem is not something\nthat the immune system can help with\nlike grabbing a bacteria and licing it\nor you know taking care of some cells\ninfected with a virus the problem is\noutside the body it's the environment so\nyou end up getting this tornado of\ndysfunction of mitochondrial dysfunction\ncaused by the environment leading to the\ncell danger response which leads to\ninnate immunity and then on top of this\nyou get the oxa of stress which is the\nthird piece of the trifecta which is\nessentially these mitochondria trying so\nhard to do their work but they're not\nworking properly so they create damaging\nmetabolic byproducts called oxid of\nstress free radicals that cause more\ndamage so this is happening in the nose\nit's happening all over the American\nBody because of our environment so\nyou've got these tornadoes of\ninterrelated physiology of mitochondrial\ndysfunction chronic inflammation\noxidative stress which if you start\ngoing to the research as a clinician\nwho's focused on symptoms and confusing\nthose for the disease and look at what's\nthe pathophysiology of arthritis what's\nthe pathophysiology of Alzheimer's\ndementia what's the pathophysiology of\ntype2 diabetes obesity fatter fatty\nliver disease polycystic ovarian\nsyndrome erectile dysfunction it all\ntraces back to this Trifecta that no\nmedication or surgery you obviously\ncan't operate on oxidative stress you\ncan operate on the downstream symptoms\nso that's the real secret that I really\nfeel like we need to reorient the\nHealthcare System around since 90% of\nhealth care costs go towards treating\nthe downstream symptoms of these and for\nevery marginal dollar we're spending on\ntreating symptoms we're getting s the\nrates are going up because they're doing\nnothing to actually affect that Trifecta\nbut to really make it\nsimple I like to think of this Trifecta\nof what I call Trifecta of bad energy\nTrifecta underlying metabolic\ndysfunction of chronic inflammation\nmitochondrial dysfunction oxidative\nstress as chronic inflammation is\nbiochemical fear its response to a\nthreat mitochondrial dysfunction is kind\nof like rolling blackouts it's not\nenough power and the oxid of stress is\nlike wildfires so it's kind of what's\nfunny to me a little bit is like what's\nhappening inside the cell is almost like\nwhat's happening like in our society\nit's like this is like living in\nCalifornia it's like blackouts fire fear\nand that's literally what's happening\ninside our cell because of the\nenvironment and uh again the optimistic\nnews that you alluded to is that we\nactually have tons of tools and tests\nthat can actually help us understand our\nlevel of metabolic health and even give\nus hints about inflammation oxidative\nstress and mitochondria dysfunction and\nit's very easy easy to improve if we\nknow what we're actually focused on well\nthat's reassuring and we're definitely\ngoing to go there um I appreciate the\nanalogy to living in California I've\nlived here my entire life I have been\noutside of California but um perhaps the\nonly thing you left out besides rolling\nblackouts fires and what was the other\none fear and fear is high taxes the\ntaxes the health debt on on the on the\nbody so in any case not to be too dark\nand pessimistic well that's the\nhealthare cost I maintain great hope and\nand still a lot of love for California\nyou know pretty great it's got It's\nGreat aspects and it's not so great\naspects and I can say that as a lifelong\nCalifornia resident um there are other\nwonderful places to live a couple of uh\nquestions first of all about places to\nlive you've been talking a lot about in\nthe United States are some of the same\nissues with metabolic dysfunction\noccurring outside of the United States I\nwould imagine so y any country where\nwe've exported the standard American\ndiet and some of the other Norms of\nWestern living are starting to see the\nsame rat\nuh of of chronic disease but like it is\nworth not mincing words here of all high\nincome countries in the world the United\nStates has the worst chronic disease\nrates and the lowest life expectancy and\nour life expectancy is going down and we\nspend about twice as much on health care\nthan the second highest spending country\nin the world so we are we are abjectly\nfailing and that failure is predicated\nin our Cult of siloing conditions into\ndifferent you know different Specialties\nand not focusing on this root cause and\nI want to just be super clear like\nthere's a war being fought right now to\nget us to believe that siloing is the\nway because as you alluded to siloing is\nprofitable if you can convince doctors\nand people that they 10 different\nsymptoms are separate things then\nthey're going to 10 different specialist\noffice office\nmeanwhile 75% of American adults are\noverweight and obese some of the highest\nin the world um a full 50% of American\nadults now have pre-diabetes and type 2\ndiabetes 50% 30% of teens have\npre-diabetes 40% of Americans have a\nmental health diagnosis cancer is set to\nreach 2 million cases this year in 2024\nhighest ever in recorded history\nAlzheimer's is going up fat liver\ndisease is affecting 40% of adults 18%\nof teens autoimmune diseases\nskyrocketing infertility is going up at\nhuge rates all these things are going up\nall at once in the US and yes in many of\nthe other countries that are eating our\ndiet um and there's no sign of it\nslowing down and so that's really if you\nlook at if you look at the research\nthrough this this different lens you'll\nfind that all of those diseases Trace\nback to metabolic dysfunction caused by\nour environment that no that no shot\npill or surgery can really address\nunless we unpack the environmental piece\nscary picture I'm glad that but hopeful\nbut hope exactly I'm glad that you are\num creating Solutions and and I should\nsay and just remind people I said this\nin my introduction but you know you're\ntalking about siloed medical care you're\ntalking about the kind of standard\nmedical system but let's not forget\nright um I happen to be a faculty at\nStanford you did your medical training\nat Stanford are a medical doctor right I\nmean you have MD and are highly trained\nyou were an ENT your nose and throat\ndoctor so if anyone would be familiar\nwith the industry and the practice and\nthe educational system around this it's\nyou so uh you're not speaking outside\nyour bwick so before we pivot to\nSolutions yeah I know people are eager\nto hear Solutions but in order to\nunderstand how to best apply those\nSolutions I do think it's worth drilling\ninto um some of the issues here just a\nlittle bit more you talked about\nunderpowered cells yeah you've also\nalluded to the fact that most people are\nconsuming enough and probably excess\namounts of caloric energy yes so is it\nthe lack of mitochondria or\nmitochondrial dysfunction that's at the\nroot of the problem the analogy I come\nup with is you've got um a power plant\nthat can convert incoming power line to\num Power that can be distributed to a\ncommunity yeah the community in this\nanalogy being the organs and cells of\nthe body yeah there's plenty of\npotential\nenergy but there's something about the\npower plant that is inefficient or\ndysfunctional they shorts they circuitry\nthat's just not working such that the\nenergy that the community can benefit\nfrom the cells and organs of the body is\njust not there so it's not a lack of\ninput it's a lack of conversion and\noutput and the consequence of this we\nsee in the form of excess adapost tissue\nand all the Downstream effects it's not\njust aesthetic it's really all the\ndownstream effects of visceral fat\nsubcutaneous fat\nEtc what is it that would\nimprove access to energy and energy\nutilization in cells is it simply a\nmatter of getting the mitochondria to\nfunction better or is it that one can\nactually create more mitochondria this\nis the key question for how we can get\nhealthy and it's really\nabout creating capacity\nin the body to turn more potential\nenergy to usable energy as opposed\nto taking that potential energy and\nshunting it to a storage form it's all\njust like I think about everything\nvisually and I'm like you got the\ncircular cell from high school biology\ntextbook inside are all the little\nmitochondria with the squiggly lines\ninside and it's just like there's X's\nthrough those mitochondria so instead of\nyou know after glycolisis and you've got\nthe pyate instead of going through the\nmitochondria it's being shuttled into\nsomething else and I I mean this is\nfundamentally the the cause of insulin\nresistance because when the body senses\nthat the mitochondria can't do that\nconversion process the cell basically\nsays because I can't convert this I\ndon't have the capacity to convert it to\nusable energy I'm going to take the\nsubstrates and I need to block them I\nmean got to turn them to basically a\nstorage form which inside the cell could\nbe toxic fats like ceramides and diog\nglycerol and I'm also going to block the\ncell from taking any more substrates\nbecause can't do anything with them that\nis fundamentally a root of insulin\nresistance so the body says okay we're\ngoing to block the ability of the\ninsulin receptor to transduce its\nintercellular signaling pathway we're\ngoing to block it and when that insulin\nbinds we're not actually going to allow\nfor glucose to come in so essentially\ninsulin resistance is the cell\ncompensating for the mitochondria being\nbroken and telling the insulin receptor\nthat it it you know that it's not going\nto be functional and so you don't get\nthe glute for you don't get the glute\nreceptors on the cell membrane to allow\nthe glucose to come in so that's that's\ninsulin resistance again we talk about\nthat as the problem but the problem is\nactually inside the cell leading to that\nyou know so that's why just giving\nsomeone insulin isn't necessarily answer\nwe have to increase mitochondrial\ncapacity to let the flow happen through\nit to energy which then trickles up into\nrelieving a lot of these problems so to\nanswer your question what we really want\nto do to increase our metabolic capacity\nfrom a first principal perspective it's\nwe need to make more mitochondria we\nneed to get each mitochondria to be more\nfunctional and we need to have each more\nfunctional mitochondria processing more\nenergy substrates it's it's really that\nsimple and the beauty is we can do all\nof those things if you actually break\ndown like what it what those three\nthings mean it means promoting mitophagy\nthe recycling of o old mitochondria to\nto new mitochondria it means promoting\nmitochondrial biogenesis it means\nincreasing the oxitive capacity of our\nindividual mitochondria it means\nimproving mitochondrial Fusion which is\nactually when mitochondria come together\nto form long chains of mitochondria that\nare more efficient so there's like a lot\nof technicality to like what it means to\nprint more mitochondria have them each\nbe more efficient and have each one do\nmore work but that's really what we want\nto do and that's when it just kind of\ngets into the simple Habits Like There's\nsimple things we can do for each of\nthose things for mitophagy\nyou know we can focus on various types\nof like endurance exercise and uh\nhigh-intensity interval exercise there's\ncompounds like Ethan a that promote\nmitophagy um when we talk about\nimproving our you know oxy of capacity\nthis is things like the Sprint workouts\nwe want to build more mitochondria this\nis resistance training literally telling\nthe body to make more so but first\nprinciples it's how do we get more of\nthese working better do doing more work\nevery day and then we think about you\nknow you look at the data on walking and\nit's like people who walk more than\n7,000 steps a day have a 50 to 65% lower\nchance of dying in 10year follow-ups and\nit's like yeah because walking is\nliterally a glucose disposal signal so\nyou're just simply asking it's not a\ngreat biogenesis signal it's not a great\nmitophagy signal but it's a great\ndisposal so if you're doing lifestyle\nhabits that do one of those three things\nwhich we can of course go into more\nyou're improving the cell's capacity to\num do that conversion process better I'd\nlike to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most\nof you have heard me tell my story about\nhow I've been taking ag1 once or twice a\nday every day since 2012 and indeed\nthat's true I started taking ag1 and I\nstill take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed Whole\nFoods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning and often\ntimes also again in the afternoon or\nevening I'm uring that I'm getting\neverything I need I'm covering all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nregularly just report feeling better and\nthat shouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order Plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman there's a lot of great science\nand a lot of um great stuff related to\ntesting and assessment of one's\nmetabolic Health that we should get into\nand will get into but since we touched\non lifestyle and because we've been\ntalking about the sort of dysfunctional\ndark side for a bit maybe we could just\ntouch on some of the lifestyle factors\nthat you just mentioned because I do\nthink it's important that people really\nstart to feel into their sense of agency\nand here we're talking about um things\nthat are relatively low time investment\ncertainly don't have much Financial cost\nin the sense that they could be done in\ngyms and with fancy equipment but they\ndon't require that um again I I want to\npoint out that these are not like strict\nprescriptives but if you had a magic\nwand and because you are interested in\nthe health of humans um let's talk about\na few of these things that can improve\num glucose disposal um and mitochondrial\nfunction uh mitophagy the removal of of\ndead or dysfunctional mitochondria so\nthey can be replaced um let's talk about\nthe walking one first you said 7,000\nsteps a day I don't track my steps um\nwhat are we really talking about there\nwe talking about taking the stairs and\ntrying to walk as much as possible maybe\nwe like if we were going to just give\nlike a really crude prescription you're\na doctor so you can prescribe things um\nwhat would you tell people to do like\nhow many short walks per day is is it\nlike three is it five is um what are we\ntalking would say up I mean at at least\nthree I would say aiming for more than\nthat is good though there's so so to\nsort of just give a sense of the picture\nof walking if walking were a pill it\nwould be the most uh impactful pill\nwe've ever had in all of modern medicine\num there was a paper in jamama uh 6,300\nparticipants followed\nfor uh 10 to 11 years and the people who\nsimply walked seven th000 steps per day\ncompared to less than that had in up to\n70% lower risk of all cause mortality in\nthe follow-up period so not causality\nbut it's it's pretty incredible they've\ndone follow-up research with slightly\ndifferent numbers showing again though\nlike many thousands of people uh in the\nstudy followed for about 10 years 8,000\nto 12,000 steps per day was associated\nwith 50 to 65% lower uh all cause\nmortality and this has been played out\nin many many studies showing about a 50%\nreduction in Alzheimer's uh dementia\nobesity type 2 diabetes depression\ncancer gastric reflux just all across\nthe board and I think the key thing is\nthat it's not about the steps it's about\nthe fact that muscle contraction is\nmedicine when we contract our muscles\neven in a very like lowgrade way like\nwalking or doing a couple air squats you\nknow we're activating ampk and we are\nessentially causing that cell to have a\nstimulus to push glucose channels to the\ncell membrane most of the time the\nglucose channels are like in vesicles\nins in little bags inside the cells\nthey're not on the cell membrane so of\ncourse that's going to keep the the\nglucose in your in your bloodstream not\nbeing processed by the mitochondria so\nwhen we think about steps it's a proxy\nmetric for just moving more throughout\nthe day so let's take two people you\nhave a person who's walking for 1 to two\nminutes every 30 minutes throughout the\nday maybe they're exercising at the end\nof the day or the beginning of the day\nmaybe they're not that person is\nstimulating glucose channels to be at\nthe membrane all day now let's take\nanother person who works out really hard\nfor one hour in the beginning or the end\nof the day they feel great about it\nthey've checked that off their box but\nthey're sitting the entire rest of the\nday yes they have gotten the benefits\nfrom the exercise but for a lot of that\nday those glucose channels are inside\nthe cell not doing the work they could\nbe doing so I think about these little\nteeny short walking breaks or push-up\nbreaks or air squat breaks every 30\nminutes or so throughout the day as me\nessentially inside the cell pushing the\nglucose channels the cell membrane to\nmake them constituently active um it's\ntotally different physiology and it's so\neasy so it's not about the steps it's\nabout muscle contraction regularly\nthroughout the day and and this has been\nshown out in actually more clinical\nresearch which has taken there's been\nseveral studies two that I think are\nfascinating where they basically took\ntwo groups and they said okay we're\ngoing to have you walk 20 minutes before\neach meal three times a day 20 minutes\nafter each meal so that's also three\ntimes a day or for like 2 minutes every\n30 minutes throughout the day so these\nare three separate groups either 20\nminutes before I either 20 minutes after\nor 2 to 3 minutes every 30 minutes all\nadded up to 60 minutes of walking or\nlight jogging a day I'm kind of\nparaphrasing two different studies that\nshowed the same thing one was jogging\none was walking but it was basically\nchunks versus short walks every 30\nminutes throughout the waking day the\ngroups that do the short movement\nregularly throughout the day even though\nthe total time is the same across all\nthe groups have significantly lower\n24-hour glucose level averages 24-hour\ninsulin level averages they are\nmetabolically healthier and I believe\nand the research mechanistically has\nshown that it's because we're\nconstitutively putting this these\nchannels at the membrane to take up the\nsubstrate use the substrate so this is\nnot in uh to to replace exercise but I\nthink it's a\nreframe I think the concept of exercise\nis something we're really very wedded to\nin our Western culture and you look at\nmore like the blue zones and the\ncentenarians and it's like they're kind\nof moving is built into their everyday\nlife so we've taken movement out of our\neveryday life as these knowledge workers\nas we've been industrialized and then we\nthink that exercise replaces that all\nday movement but biochemically it does\nnot so I think a big part of kind of\ndigging ourselves out of this chronic\ndisease mess and creating capacity for\nmitochondria is finding ways to take a\nlot of the activities we do now seated\nand just find a way to do more of them\nmoving standing or walking or if that's\ntough you really need to sit at your\ndesk all day then every 30 minutes\ntaking 2 minutes to do some just light\nmovement Flex those muscles get the\nglucose channels at the membrane get the\nmitochondria active so and I think\nanother fascinating stat is like our gym\nmemberships in the US have doubled since\nthe year 2000 and obesity has gone up in\nthe same period so there's some mismatch\nbetween our obsession with exercise and\nour actual outcomes that we're seeing\nand I think it's that we have not\nactually rebuilt\nconstitutive movement into our daily\nlives very interesting because I think a\nlot of people are now working out so to\nspeak doing resistance training which I\nthink is terrific ter used to be such\nyou know such so restricted to Niche\nsubculture stuff like bodybuilding\npreseason football military Etc and now\nit's a more ubiquitous uh for everybody\nmen women young old that's terrific same\nthing with things like yoga and\ncardiovascular training I mean I it like\nto study the history of exercise culture\nand it wasn't\nbut in the' 60s when you know jogging\nwas considered kind of like whoa that's\nlike a really esoteric Niche culture\nthing so A lot's changed um I love the\nprescriptives you gave because it's just\nvery straightforward a couple of short\nwalks um it just makes so much sense um\nand I love the visual and I hope people\nwill really hold it in mind so I'll\nreiterate it the the um translocation of\nthese um energy utilization stores vles\nas you call them these little packets\nfrom the center of the cell out to the\ncell surface where then they can be Evol\ninvolved excuse me in metabolic\nprocesses and the utilization of energy\nin ways that um otherwise they wouldn't\nand glucose disposal being a big part of\nthis so I have heard that a short walk\nafter a meal will reduce blood glucose\nin a way that's really dramatic huge\namount 30 35% just taking a walk around\nthe block after meal that's definitely a\nprescription I think everyone should do\nbecause the research is so strong on it\nis that building in simply a 10minute\nwalk around the block or a dance party\nin the kitchen moving your muscles for\n10 minutes after a meal can drastically\nreduce your glucose response because\nyou're just bringing all those channels\nto the membrane you're taking up the\nglucose you're using it it's a whole\ndifferent physiology than sitting on the\ncouch after a meal that's very high\nimpact it's high leverage if it's after\na meal so highly recommend that and the\nlevels data and clinical data has shown\nthat out time and time again whenever I\ngo to a city like New York when I am\nforced to walk more I I always just feel\nso much better we also know that the\noptic flow that one experiences with\nwalking has some interesting effects on\nthe lyic pathways and quieting of some\nof the anxiety and stress related\nPathways um this links up with things\nlike EMDR although there are factors\nthat are separate from EMDR basically\nmoving through space um not outer space\nbut walking through space with optic\nflow has a certain um anxiety reduction\nfunction in the brain which they\nbeautiful data there in my opinion um\nokay so that touches on walking you did\nmention higher intensity exercise so\nlet's um keep it within the\ncardiovascular realm for now so um\ngetting heart rate way way up you know\ngetting breathing hard for you know some\nminutes um each week maybe a couple\ntimes per week um seems that's a good\nway to increase mitochondrial function\nand mitochondrial number is that right\nyeah so you take sort of each each type\nof exercise we've got walking we've got\nresistance training we've got\nhigh-intensity interval training we've\ngot endurance training and then we've\ngot sort of more like zone two uh so\nwe've got these different flavors of how\nwe get our heart rate up how we get the\nblood flowing what we signal to the\ncells and each one actually has like a\nslightly different impact on the\nmitochondria when we think about\nbiogenesis we're thinking mostly like\nendurance exercise and really um more of\nthat zone two and like that is really\ngoing to be a stim inside the cell to\nprint more mitochondria when we think\nabout improving mitochondrial Fusion\nhigh-intensity interval training is\nreally really good for that when we\nthink about resistance training it's\nlike that's like muscle hypertrophy\nwe're going to be creating more muscle\ncells and we need more mitochondria for\nthose so each one has kind of a\ndifferent impact and I think this is\nwhere honestly I think the regular\nguidelines that we have even by our\ngovernment you know actually make a lot\nof sense it's like work every major\nmuscle group three times a week in a\ndistance type training and then work to\nget 75 to 150 minutes of moderate\nactivity so 75 minutes of strenuous\nactivity or 150 minutes per week of\nmoderate activity so that actually makes\na lot of sense 80% of Americans are not\nmeeting those very basic guidelines and\n20% of Americans don't get any physical\nactivity really at all activity for the\naverage American is 3,000 to 4,000 steps\nper day which is less than 2 miles so we\nare not even close to even even meeting\nthe basic recommendations that are out\nthere but I think those are pretty\nreasonable resistance training two to\nthree times a week most major muscle\ngroups and working to you know get the\nget the heart rate up moderate level uh\nfor 150 minutes a week or strenuous for\n75 minutes a week those are going\ntogether to be potent stimuli for\nbiogenesis mitophagy mitochondrial\nFusion for increasing antioxidant\nenzymes that are going to\nprotect the mitochondria from that oxa\nof stress um and the one that's just\nactually not in there in the in the sort\nof the basic recommendations for\nAmericans is the walking and I would\njust absolutely add to that at least\n7,000 steps per day based on what the\nthe data is showing which honestly would\nprobably take less than an hour total to\ndo if you if you break it up throughout\nthe day it's just a few minutes a day so\nthat right there are going to be like a\nbig multifaceted\nset of signals for increasing\nmitochondrial capacity in different ways\nterrific what what are your thoughts on\num under the desk treadmilling I I don't\nown one of these but and I try and get\nwalks and I definitely do my three\nresistance training exra uh sessions per\nweek different muscle groups on\ndifferent days so it ends up being each\nmuscle group is hit directly once and\nindirectly a second time but I like to\ndo a long hike once on the weekend a run\nin the middle of the week that's 30\nmaybe 35 minutes and then some V2 Max\nreally short workout 12 minutes total\nwhere basically I'm just going for um\nyou know the feeling that my uh heart is\ngoing to jump out of my chest and I'm\ngoing to get going to die from gasem of\na but luckily thus far I haven't died\nnonetheless um the total time commitment\nisn't that great but I find that I'm at\na desk a lot and I have a standing desk\nis it wise to get a treadmill to\ntreadmill under the desk seems like it\nwould be one of the best things one\ncould do I'm a massive fan of under\ntreadmill desks because genuinely I\nbelieve that if we\nif we move more of our daily activities\nthat we're doing seated indoors to\nOutdoors moving it would it would it\nwould radically change the health of the\nUnited States with real physiology\nunderneath it so there's actually been\nresearch on underdesk standing desk that\nis pretty interesting small studies but\nthey you know took a handful of people I\nthink it was around 10 um in a workplace\nenvironment and they had them use under\ndesk treadmills for two and a half hours\nuh per day during the workday so not a\nlot at very so speeds for uh two weeks\nand people lost on average 2.6 lb of fat\nand put on 2.2 lbs of lean mass wild in\na very short period of time the study\nmakes a somewhat wild claim that if this\nwere extrapolated to a year we\nanticipate that we could see a loss of\n44 to 66 pounds assuming assuming it's\nline near progression exactly which is\nnot which is not the case folks but I\nthat's why I'm saying it was it was a\npretty but that was there in the\ndiscussion and but I think that short\nperiod is quite interesting um so that's\nthat's pretty significant and that's\njust for two and a half hours a day so I\nthink now that they're about $150 on\nAmazon these underd dust treadmills I\nthink for anyone who's a knowledge\nworker it's a good thing to have at your\nhouse and the way I use it is like I\nbasically just force myself to start my\nday on the treadmill desk and I say to\nmyself if I don't like it after 5\nminutes I'll sit down if I need to sit\nbut I'll start and just see how it feels\nand then an hour goes by and I've\nforgotten I'm even on it is that right\nso you're able to work without thinking\nabout having to to um to treadmill I am\nputting it at such a slow speed I think\nI'm usually walking at like one mile per\nhour I mean it's very very glacially\nslow I do put my aura ring on my second\ntoe when I do this because otherwise it\ndoesn't count my steps because if your\nhands are your desk they uh they it\nwon't count your steps because the AA\nRings measuring hand accelerometry yeah\nbut um it it it's incredible how even at\na 1.0 one mile per hour speed after two\nto three hours you're easily going to\nget six seven 8,000 steps and then throw\nin a couple other short walks throughout\nthe day and you're you're getting there\neasily so it's just a it's just a great\nway to build back in what modernity took\naway and that unfortunately is\nunavoidable that that regular movement\nfor good physiology so I'm a big fan of\nthem and the data suggests that for a\ncouple hours a day they can actually\nhave a have an impact on body\ncomposition which I think is is a great\neasy inexpensive thing for people to do\nbut if you if you don't want to buy one\nlike just set those timers and uh and\nbuild in the walks you know throughout\nthe day outside terrific yeah I'm a I'm\na fan of getting walks when I can I also\nI wonder your thoughts on there was a\nstudy not sure if you're familiar with\nit um published at the University of\nHouston where they looked at what they\ncalled Solus push-ups um which all the\ngym goers are going to roll their eyes\num imagine sitting down and raise\npressing your toe against the ground and\nraising your heel so kind of like seated\ncalf raay but no weight right under the\ndesk and this study had some remarkable\nclaims and conclusions um which included\nas I recall that the activation of this\nmuscle the Solus which makes up about 1%\nof the body's total musculature um\ninvolved caused rather a\ndisproportionate use of blood glucose so\nit mobilized blood glucose in a good way\num and the idea was if people would it's\nnot just bouncing your knee but would\nactively push their toes against the\nground and raise their heels as they\nwere seated and doing work that somehow\nthere would be a positive effect on\nmetabolism and blood glucose utilization\nI talked a little bit about this on\nsocial media and a few other podcasts\nand and it was interesting to see that\nsort of attacks that I got like people\nreally didn't like the idea um that this\nwas any different than so-called neat\nnon-exercise and um activated\nthermogenesis so it's known that people\nthat fidget a lot or or move around a\nlot burn a lot of calories this actually\ngoes back to some really beautiful work\num several decades or more ago from\nRothwell and stock who talked about like\nthe fact that animals and people who\nfidget a lot burn a lot of energy they\ntend to be thinner they tend to have\nlower adapost tissue stores um and it's\nbecause they're just burning a lot more\ncalories and this is actually what um\npeople who suffer from anorexia which is\nby the way the most deadly of the\npsychiatric condition so it's um we're\ntalking about true anorexia are\nencouraged not to do because um they\neither do it spontaneously or they learn\nthat it's a very efficient way to burn\ncalories and that's not what they need\nbut many people do need to burn more\ncalories so um bounce in the knee that\nthing that drives everybody crazy if\nyou're not the one doing it um Solus\npush-ups uh what are your thoughts about\nthis in that study we don't have to pick\nit apart in detail but I thought it was\nkind of interesting it's all coming back\nto just moving the body as much as\npossible during the day Contracting\nmuscles Contracting mus Contracting\nmuscles it's medicine and I I find the\nconcept of neat just endlessly\nfascinating you know because we we kind\nof come up with this term non-exercise\nactivity thermogenesis and the data is\nreally good about it like it's basically\nshows that this is a a prime potential\nintervention for the Obesity epidemic\nand it all goes back to the cell like\nit's a it's essentially a stimulus\nthat's telling the body to stay\nmetabolically active as opposed to\nkeeping all those metabolic pathways you\nknow dormant during the day um and I\nthink that it just it is funny though\nthat like we have these acronyms for\nbasically like this is just the way life\nwas a hundred years ago if you look at\nlike the\n1800s Almost 100% of Americans lived on\na farm basically like\npre-industrialization pre- urbanization\nmost Americans not 100% but close lived\nthey grew some of their own food they\nlived either on a farm or had a large\ngarden now that number is less than 1%\nso like movement was just buil into\neverything we did and and you think from\nthere like what has happened like we\nwere outside we were moving our\nactivities of daily living involved\nmovement and if you just take the\ngrocery example then it moved to like\nokay maybe farmers markets and sort of\nlike you know outdoor open air markets\nthen it's supermarkets then it's you\nknow now it's literally buying food\nonline with the click of the button and\nnow some people aren't even doing that\nthey're literally on the food delivered\nto them with Uber Eats so at every level\nwe've taken away movement from everyday\nlife and now we have sort of an acronym\nto like bring it back in but really it's\nabout just you know giving the body\nstimulus stimuli that the cells have\nbeen entrained to expect throughout all\nof human history and building the back\ninto our Modern Life so I think neat\nit's incredibly important\nand I think it also brings up this point\nthat like is so critical which is\nlike I really think our way out of this\nchronic disease epidemic and even for\npeople who are listening don't have a\nchronic disease any real chronic\nsymptoms we're dealing with and just the\nfact that we're not feeling as good as\nwe could like the way out is pretty\nsimple like it's it's some of these\nbasic things like walking more\nthroughout the day moving more\nthroughout the day getting outside you\nknow eating clean unpoisoned food the\nthe a lot of these things that have the\nbest data are so simple and I think it's\nlike really important to just always\nremember like the game and the industry\nit's all about how complex can we make\nit like specialization talking about\nsome of the minutia but like at the end\nof the day all the simple habits that we\nknow are healthy like fundamentally\nimprove cellular biology and like some\nof these things like the neat like the\nwalking like it's emblematic of the fact\nthat um some of the simplest Solutions\nare the ones that are by far the most\neffective and I think I think the\nbiggest misconception in healthcare\nright now is that the way out and the\nway to get really back to to True\nincredible health is complicated like\nit's it's really not that complicated we\nwe've got to move more you know\nthroughout the day that's one of them\nand you know on each pillar that we\ntouched on earlier food sleep all of\nthis you know when we talk about the\nsimple habits that know work the reason\nthey work is because they all positively\nimpact the mitochondria they positively\nimpact oxy of stress they positively\nimpact inflammation so yeah I love it I\nlove Simple Solutions that hit multiple\ncellular Pathways that can make\neverybody healthier I'd like to just\ntake a quick break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors insid tracker inside\ntracker is a personalized nutrition\nplatform that analyzes data from your\nblood and DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help you reach\nyour health goals now I've long been a\nbeliever in getting regular blood work\ndone for the simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact our immediate\nand long-term Health can only be\naddressed that is can only be measured\nwith a quality blood test now one issue\nwith many blood tests out there is that\nyou get information back about lipid\nlevels hormone levels metabolic factors\nEtc but you don't know what to do with\nthat information with inside tracker\nthey make it very easy to understand\nyour levels and what they mean and\nspecific actionable items that you can\nundertake in in order to bring those\nlevels into the ranges that are optimal\nfor you insid tracker also offers insid\nTracker Pro which enables coaches and\nhealth professionals to provide premium\nand personalized Services by leveraging\ninside trackers analysis

insid\ntracker.com huberman I'd like to talk\nabout assessment blood tests in\nparticular um I remember in college I\nwas just very curious about blood\ntesting and I had read a little bit\nabout it but it was really hard to\naccess um I actually went to the Student\nHealth Center and said you know can I\njust get um like my lipids measured some\nhormone stuff measured I was in great\nhealth I just want to do that and\nthey're like no like what's the issue\nyou know why why why would you do that\nnow it's very easy to find places that\nwill do blood tests but there is some\ncost often um and nowadays thanks to\nyour efforts your innovative and\nEngineering efforts and the efforts of\nothers there are ways to measure what's\nin your blood blood glucose in\nparticular um with continuous monitoring\nand with um snapshot monitoring so um\nlet's talk about blood tests what what\ndo you think are um the three to five\nthings that basically everybody if they\ncan should know about what circulating\nin their blood I'm I'm imagining LDL HDL\nthis kind of thing I guess apob is a big\nuh favorite of our our friend Peter AA\num fasting blood glucose continuous\nblood glucose postmeal Etc just kind of\nevaluating how exercise food Etc impacts\nblood glucose and then I'll leave the\nother categories open because my my\npoint here is not to answer the question\nfor that's what comes to mind you've got\nyou know you've got the big ones so this\nthis is key is that every single person\nlistening I hope after this episode will\ngo to their health record or send their\ndoctor a message and at least get the\nfollowing test and the first seven that\nI'll mention are very basic and people\nmight take umage to them because\nobviously there's a lot of debate about\nlike what's everyone's favorite lab test\nbut I think about it as like what are\nthe basics that everyone should know and\nthen what's like the next tier up that\nare easy to access and are cheap that'll\ngive you a lot more richness but which\nyou still might have to kind of fight\nyour doctor for so the first few that\nyou will not have to fight your doctor\nfor and are often free on an annual\nphysical and literally Define metabolic\nsyndrome are fasting glucose fasting\ntriglycerides HDL cholesterol hemoglobin\nA1c total cholesterol waste\ncircumference and blood pressure okay\nsorry I hate to interrupt and my\naudience hates it even more but I'm\ngoing to just could you just explain\nwhat each of those is and what it what\nit corresponds to yes great thank you\nand and I will say first of all the\nreason I'm choosing these it's not it's\nnot even my own choice really it's it's\ntwo reasons one is that the two studies\nover the past 5 years that have shown Us\nin large populations that the vast\nmajority of American adults are\nmetabolically dysfunctional use those\nbiomarkers so I think because of that\nit's important to know them and the two\nstudies that I'm referring to are one\nfrom UNCC in 2018 which showed that\nbased on those biomarkers 88% of\nAmerican adults are have suboptimal\nmetabolism and then a follow-up study\nfrom the Journal of the American College\nof Cardiology from last year show that\nthat number has gone to\n93.2% of American adults are suboptimal\nin their metabolism and these are the\nmetrics that they used and they're very\nbasic if you had to pay out of pocket\nthey would be less than $100 so let's\ntalk through them why they're great is\nbecause together they give you kind of\nlike a tapestry of what's actually\nhappening inside the cell if you choose\nto look at them that way if you read The\nTea Leaves of them are the doctors often\nif they see all these lab tests it'll be\nan electronic health record we've all\nbeen through this experiment experience\nthey'll come up on the screen and there\nwill either be like a green orange or\nred color next to it like it's high it's\nlow it's borderline and the doctor will\nbasically it's very algorithmic oh you\nknow your LDL is high we need to bring\nit down oh your glucose is high we need\nto bring it down oh your blood pressure\nis high we need to bring it down but\nwhat I'm inviting people to do is\nunderstand a little bit about each test\nand then read the Tea Leaves of what\nit's telling us about our mitochondria\nso let's start with fasting glucose so f\nfting glucose when you look at these\nstudies that I'm referring to they call\nOptimal less than 100 so to define\nwhether you were in that 88 or 93% you\nhad to essentially be in the their their\noptimal range for all biomarkers not on\nmedication so I'll quickly run through\nwhat their ranges were my ranges for\noptimal are tighter than these but\nfasting glucose less than 100\ntriglycerides less than 150 HDL above 40\nfor men or 50 for women hemog glob1 C\nless than\n5.7% total cholesterol to HDL ratio less\nthan 3.5 to 1 waist circumference less\nthan 35 in for women or 40 in for men\nand blood pressure less than 120 over 80\nif those things were in those ranges and\nyou weren't on medication for blood\nsugar or or blood pressure or whatnot\nyou were considered optimally\nmetabolically healthy that's now 6.8% of\nAmericans um\nall of these biomarkers are easy to\nchange in one to two months I would say\nwith simple lifestyle habits could you\nremind us what hemoglobin A1c is I think\nmost people are familiar with HDL\ncholesterol being the quote unquote good\ncholesterol and LDL being the bad\ncholesterol and as I say that I know I'm\ngoing to get dog piled oh totally but\nI'm not sure that I adhere to that I'm\nnot sure I don't adhere to that I'm not\nsure about a lot of things but I am sure\nthat most people think of them that way\num so just as a yeah to stay functional\nhere we we'll frame it that way for now\nwith with the caveat that that might not\nbe the whole story isn't the whole story\nbut um triglycerides fat in the blood\nfatty stuff but so key to understand\nabout the triglycerides it's not PE we\ndon't want to confuse triglycerides with\neating more fat triglycerides are a\nstorage form of excess carbohydrates in\nthe blood so this is why it can tell us\nsomething about and I know you and you\nand Rob lusting talked about this at\nlength but LAN\nyeah I mean one of the things that's\nreally tricky gosh is that the the\nlanguage around nutrition and health is\ncomplicated because people hear the word\nfat they think body fat but then they\nalso think the macronutrient fat we just\nneed more words to better parse totally\nthe reality in biology we call the two\nmajor groups of of people lumpers and\nSplitters lumpers like to lump\neverything together it oversimplifies\nand complicates Splitters like to split\neverything give a name for everything\nindividual name for everything it\ncomplicates and so there's a middle\nground right there's a there's a land of\nreasonable people and nomenclature and\nunfortunately that does not exist on the\ninternet nor does it exist in any one\nspecific subfield of medicine or science\nI mean so much of the confusion out in\nthe world is because of a lack of\nadequate language right in order to\nexplain okay so um the triglycerides are\na reflection of excess carbohydrate\nintake and how it's helping us with that\ntapestry of understanding the trifecta\nof bad energy is that if you think about\nit let's just go back to that cell and\nthat Poe mitochondria that's being\nabsolutely decimated by our environment\nuh and its capacity is low okay so that\nmitochondria is like I can't process\nglucose or fatty acids to ATP very well\nso I'm going to block their entry into\nthe cell so now you've got glucose\nrising in the bloodstream so okay\nfasting glucose that was one of our\nenviral markers if that's going up that\nis a little bit of that tapestry of\nmaybe something's going on inside the\ncell that's blocking the entry into the\ncell so it's rising the bloodstream okay\nwell where's all that the this the body\ndoes not want lots of glucose floating\naround in the bloodstream because it can\nliterally independently cause\nendothelial dysfunction which is\nbasically blood vessel problems it can\ncause oxidative stress in the\nbloodstream it can cause glycation which\nis sugar literally just sticking to\nthings we the body doesn't want that\nglucose high in the bloodstream so it\nconverts it to triglycerides to be\nstored in a storage form of energy\nthat's a key point that I think is\nhelpful to understand is that the body\nit's always trying to like kind of keep\nthings in the right range so it'll\nconvert things so then triglycerides a\npicture in your blood of glucose being\nhigh and triglycerides being high is\nvery much should signal to everyone when\nthey look at their Labs that there's\nprobably something going on inside in\ninside the cell that's blocking the cell\nfrom being able to use and process it's\na sign of mitochondrial dysfunction and\nchronic overnutrition too much substrate\nnot enough processing glucose is going\nto go up Tri are going to go up and so\nso then if you kind of squint and read\nthe tea leaves it's like huh I think\nmetabolic dysfunction and what's\nfascinating is that the travesty in our\nhealthare system is that a patient might\ngo into the\ndoctor and their fasting glucose is 99\none point under what we'd consider the\nnormal range and their triglycerides are\n149 one point under what we'd consider\nthe normal range from these things that\ndoctor might say to that patient you're\ntotally fine both glucose and\ntriglycerides are normal\nbut that's just really problematic\nbecause they're on the upper end of\nnormal for both of those and so really\nwhat that would say to me as someone\nthinking about the mitochondria is like\nthis person is definitely metabolically\ndysfunctional they're on the highest end\nof normal for both triglycerides and\nglucose there's something there's\ndefinitely insulin resistance going on\nhere I would much rather see that\nglucose at 703 and that triglyceride at\n50 which to me would say oh this cell's\nprocessing through energy great and\nthings are moving through and we're not\nbacking up in the bloodstream we're not\nconverting to triglycerides so that's\nwhere really optimal ranges get in but\nbut so that's so that's glucose and\ntriglycerides why if those are starting\nto creep up it's a sign that something\nis happening metabolically and then when\nwe look at some of the other biomarkers\nso hemoglobin A1c is really so that's a\nmarker that's looking at how many of the\nhemoglobin molecules that are in the red\nblood cells that carry oxygen how many\nof those hemoglobin molecules have sugar\nstuck to them and that's glycation so\nyou're looking at glycated hemoglobin\nand you can imagine that if the\nconcentration of glucose is higher over\ntime more glucose is going to stick to\nred blood cells and that's going to\ncreate a higher percentage of glycated\nhemoglobin so that's why that lab is\nrepresented as a percentage so less than\n5.7 is what we want you want those cells\nnice and smooth and slippery smooth no\nsugar stuck to them causing dysfunction\num and because blood cells last for\nabout 9 to 120 days hemoglobin A1c is\ngiving us a basically a snapshot of\naverage blood sugar levels over 9 to 120\ndays and if that average is higher again\nprobably a sign that cells are rejecting\nglucose from the cell and it's causing\nto rise in the\nbloodstream and\nthen just talking about one other\nbiomarker in that that we talked about\nwhich was blood pressure people might\nsay well how does blood pressure relate\nto like what's going on inside the cell\nyou know in the mitochondria and whatnot\nand a really the fascinating link is\nthat when that cell becomes insulin\nresistance which again is a compensatory\nmechanism for mitochondrial\ndysfunction the insulin is going to rise\nin the blood because the body's insulin\nresistant so the body's going to turn\nout more insulin to try and overcome the\ninsulin block to drive the sugar into\nthe cells so insulin levels rise well\ninsulin is one of the key activators of\nnitric oxide which is the molecule in\nthe blood that dilates and relaxes blood\nvessels and so when we become insulin\nresistant and we're not responding to\nthat insulin signal we end up getting\nless nitric oxide activity so this is\nhow kind of looking at even these very\nbasic very cheap biomarkers through the\nlens of basic cellular physiology we can\nstart to see man my body might be like\nunderpowered I might I might have a\nmitochondrial issue here so that's a few\nof those tests that we really want to\nshoot for terrific and um thanks for\nbringing up blood pressure again it's\nsort of um comes across to many people\nas old school right but when AO was here\num one of the several times he was here\nhe he really pushed on blood pressure is\nsuch such a key metric right I mean\nobviously if blood pressure is high\nyou're getting less nitric oxide through\nfor whatever means here uh vessels and\ncapillaries are constricted um cells\naren't able to use the energy that's\ncoming in there's excess energy there's\nbuildup of metabolic waste there's all\nthis stuff and now we can start to see\nthe picture yeah it's trying to emerge\nand as you mentioned um briefly these\nmarkers can be put into healthy range or\nmaybe even fantastic range in a very\nshort period of time so we'll talk about\num how to go about that um in terms of\ngetting a basic blood test is you're a\nphysician what's the secret code um I'll\ngive away one that um\na former guest who's also an MD shared\nwhich is oftentimes if you ask your\nphysician for a blood test they will say\nwell unless there's a particular need or\nyou're um struggling with something they\nwon't give it to you but if you have a\nshift from Baseline in a symptom or in a\nnumber that can help all the Physicians\nare going to come after me now with I\nguess with stethoscopes um uh I'm\nwilling to Stand My Ground\num if you want a blood test it's often\nuseful to mention that there's 's been\nsome Market shift um you want to be\nhonest right but some Market shift in\nsleep in lifestyle in how you feel\nstanding up sitting down I'm not trying\nto you know lace people's minds with\nideas to to uh create narratives here\nbut um oftentimes where Physicians are\nresistant they'll be more amendable if\nthey understand that hey like\nsomething's changing and the patient\nsaying something's changing it actually\nwould be irresponsible of them to not\ngive the blood test so there you go um\nBring It On MDS so yeah truly and I\nthink the nice thing about the again\nvery basic tests and there are so many\nother tests that I talked about in my\nbook and that you've talked about on\nyour podcast apob uric acid fasting\ninsulin hom IR hscrp liver function test\nggt all these other tests that are great\nthat can really tell us more about\nmitochondrial dysfunction oxidative\nstress chronic inflammation but the ones\nI'm mentioning are the ones that you\nwill not have to fight with your doctor\nabout like the the the everything I just\nmentioned like the doctor should order\non an annual physical and it's really\nabout us learning to act like read the\nTea Leaves of what they're saying and\nnot look at them in this algorithmic way\nbut like how together if they're\ncreeping up or if many of them are a\nlittle bit high like we need to focus\nall of our energy on improving\nmitochondrial capacity basically and and\nbring those numbers down which we can do\nvery very quickly once you start getting\nthe mitochondria moving through more of\nthose substrates a lot of them will just\nnaturally come down now in the book I\ngive scripts to literally talk to your\ndoctor with because you are going to get\npush back often if you ask for a fasting\ninsulin I would say probably I mean even\nthough doctors are waking up a little\nbit like maybe 85% of people are going\nto have their doctors say they won't\norder that for them so I actually think\nthere's a huge benefit I hate to say it\nbut like going outside the system this\nis where I think\ninnovation has been valuable there's a\nlot of like amazing companies doing\ndirect to Consumer lab testing so you\ncan basically avoid the hassle and some\nof them are very affordable there's um\nfunction health is a company that's\ndoing 110 biomarkers including all the\nkey metabolic biomarkers for less than\n$500 and they'll do it twice a year so\nyou don't ever have to and then they do\ninterpretations um insid tracker uh next\nHealth levels is doing labs and so\nthere's a lot of this springing up\nbecause I think people are sick of\nfighting with their doctors to get a a\ncrumb of information about their health\nand it's it's it's we should probably be\ntesting these I would say three to four\ntimes a year um and the beauty is is\nthat like I think a lot of what keeps\npeople down in the health world is that\nthey're confused about what to do\nthere's a lot of noise there's a lot of\ndifferent\nstrategies you know do I do you know\npaleo keto carnivore vegan Mediterranean\ndo I do hit or Zone 2 or Ecentric it's\nlike there's so much noise and the\nbeauty with having a plan for\nunderstanding your biomarkers regularly\nis that you can cut through all the\nnoise try a strategy see where you stand\nre retest in a few months and see if\nyou're moving in the right direction s\nyou don't have to trust your doctor you\ndon't have to trust me you don't have to\ntrust anyone you can literally trust\nyour own labs and I I I say to people\nlike if your labs are optimal and the\nranges I just mentioned are not optimal\nlike we you want to actually get to\nbetter than all of those if you want to\nbe optim if your if your key metabolic\nbiomarkers are optimal\nif you feel absolutely freaking\nincredible and you have no symptoms then\nyou're probably doing the right strategy\nwhatever that is vegan keto whatever\nlike and and exercise and your lifestyle\nbecause that is showing that your cells\nare fundamentally working properly so I\nthink that's just a really empowering\nmessage and now there's phenomenal\ncompanies that are cropping up to\nbasically help allow people to do this\non their own schedule which I think is\nreally the future of health and actually\nwill help lessen I think some of the\nintensity of the diet Wars you know\nbecause it's like people can just say\nlike I trust my strategy I know I'm\ndoing what's right for me cuz like look\nat all my biomarkers and I feel great\nyou know so yeah what used to be the\nbefore and after um you know pre-diet\nexercise post- diet exercise um photos\non social media are now starting to also\ninclude numbers which is kind of\ninteresting I mean obviously these\naren't randomized control trials but\nit's cool to see people posting their\nnumbers yeah of things that are\nnot just related to Aesthetics but are\num or body weight but are related to\nhealth metrics yeah uh it's it's it's\nfun I think it it speaks to um a more\nscientific or at least a more\nquantitative approach to things and I\nthink it's inspiring for people um\nthanks for putting those scripts in the\nbook that people can refer to um let's\nsay that um I go in for these blood\ntests I do the basic 7 and I find that\nmy fasting glucose is a little high my\ntriglycerides are a little high my LDL\nis a little high um maybe a few other\nthings are okay so I'm kind of in the\nyou know not in the Red Zone but I'm in\nthe like I should probably pay attention\nto these things what are some of the\nthings that one can do in order to try\nand move those needles in the right\ndirection um I know we talked about\nwalking in movement before what are a\nfew others and maybe we could start to\ntouch into Nutrition a little bit and\nthen we'll pivot to um insulin and blood\nglucose I think on the highest level\nit's about\nrunning through what are the\nscience-based things that we know in our\nenvironment can lead to metabolic\ndysfunction and take honest stock of how\nthose factors are playing out in your\nlife and then choose a few to start\nmoving in a different direction so the\nones that I think are ones that we can\nreally control um and that are we know\nbased on the science are impacting our\nmitochondrial and metabolic health is\nthe food the Sleep the movement the\nemotional health the toxins our\nrelationship with light and our\nrelationship with temperature and your\njourney to Optimal metabolic Health\nmight be totally different from mine\nbecause I might really need to focus on\nthe food and the sleep and the emotional\nhealth and you might really need to\nfocus on the toxins and the light and\nthe movement and so it's a lot of it is\nactually taking stock on where the\nlevers are in your own life where are\nyou crushing it and where is there a lot\nof room for improvement so Step One is\nknowing like that those are the thing\nthose are the things in our environment\nthat we need to to basically improve to\nhave to give our CS the best capacity\nand then of course checking your\nbiomarkers to make sure your\ninterventions are working but but food I\nthink is one that is like totally\nunavoidable of those pillars those Seven\nPillars food is one that most of us are\ngetting wrong and that we really\nactually have to get right to improve\nour metabolic health for a lot of\nreasons I mean our bodies are basically\n100% molecularly made from food that's\nso wild it's so wild every time I think\nabout that I kind of like blows my mind\nlike babies are 3D printed from food\nbasically inside a woman's body it's\nit's wild to me and then what's so cool\nabout the body what brings me just\nimmense awe every day is that like we\nhave this conception in our Western\nworld that the body is like a thing that\nwe're with throughout our life because\nwe kind of look the same and we like age\nslowly so it's like Casey is a thing and\nAndrew is a thing but the body is\nactually a process the body and there's\nthis amazing dos statement like life is\na process not an entity I love that\nno I'm sorry to interrupt I'm just I I\nalways you know wish that if people\ncould understand that um with Biology\nand health understanding the nouns and\nthe names is important but it's verbs\nit's verbs verbs verbs if you understand\nthat things are processes or processes\ndepending on who you are and where you\nlive in the world um it all becomes so\nmuch more tractable yes and it's so much\nmore hopeful because if I'm a process if\nyou're a process then every every day\nwe're eating we are changing the process\nwhereas if you think you're a thing then\nthere's no hope cuz I'm just I'm Casey\nand that's who I am and I have this\ndisease you know and I think so much in\nour language actually of healthc\ncare both are Western sort of despir\nnature like we don't really have a lot\nof curiosity with with process but even\nlike the ideas the way we talk about\ndisease I have diabetes you know and I I\nand and we don't even talk about\ndiabetes cures which now a lot of people\nare curing their diabetes we call it\nremission like it's this thing that's a\npart of you and I think I just love this\nidea of like we're evolving every day\nand food is so important because again\nwe take in 70 metric tons of food in the\nlifetime two to three pounds per day one\nmetric ton per year on average and that\nis like the printer ink that's the 3D\nprinter ink to create tomorrow's version\nof oursel which is molecularly different\nthan the Casey of today that's a hopeful\nmessage because if we can give the body\nfood which you know I think we again our\nour conception of food I think is very\nlimited um food is the molecular\nbuilding blocks of the body it is the\ncell signaling functional molecules that\ntell our cells what to do they act as\ntranscription factors epigenetic\nmodifiers um cell signaling pathway\nintermediates and it's also of course\nthe substrate to change what the\nmicrobiome does and the composition of\nthe M microbiome which is basically a\npharmacy inside our bodies to create\ndifferent molecules that can affect our\nhealth so food is certainly a calorie is\na calorie from the concept of\nthermodynamics but from the concept of\nmolecular\ninformation it has three massively\nimportant parts that are unavoidable for\ncreating cellular health so I would just\nsay that that is the pillar that we can\ndrill be happy to drill into of like\nwhat do we really do to\nyou know build build as much metabolic\nHealth as possible yeah I want to focus\nnow if you're willing on food not just\nmacronutrients proteins fats and\ncarbohydrates not just calories although\nthat as well but things like timing\nthings like fasting um and\nmicronutrients which I think is a a\nhighly underexplored topic so with\nrespect to food um gosh I feel like\nwe've all been exposed to pretty much\nevery variation of you know it's it's\nall calories in calories out and by the\nway I believe in the laws of\nthermodynamics um so yes total caloric\nload matters total energy expenditure\nmatters without question within the\nframework of not consuming excess\ncalories there's a lot to explore\nhowever um I can just say for myself for\nwhat it's worth I'm not very hungry\nuntil 11:00 a.m. noon or 1 I'm okay not\neating until then and just you know\nwater electrolyt and caffeine does me\njust fine I can exercise Etc but once I\nstart eating I I really enjoy eating and\nI mostly like the proteins I like Meat\nand Fish and eggs and I like cheese and\nvegetables and carbohydrates and fruit\nand all of it I like all the stuff and I\nI tend to like single or few ingredient\nFoods I just naturally do so I've been\nlucky in that way but I know a lot of\npeople like sandwiches processed foods\nthings that are combinations of\ningredients what do we know about about\nkind of uh I don't want to say optimal\nbut if one we're going to explore\ndifferent ways of eating for sake of\nadjusting these biomarkers in the right\ndirection and improving metabolic health\nis there kind of a a generic jumping off\npoint would most people for instance be\nwise to um cut back on the total number\nof sugars or the the total amount of\nsugar rather and perhaps reduce the\namount of carbohydrate and replace it\nwith some lean quality protein I mean\nare there generalizations that we can\nmake or is it really all just about not\ngetting excessive calories and trying to\nget those calories from the most\nnutrient-rich sources well just Drilling\nin on two things you just said there so\none thing you said that was interesting\nwas that you're lucky that you like all\nof those foods and then the second thing\nwas is it just about not getting excess\ncalories but I think what's interesting\nabout both of those is that I would\nargue that the reason you like those\nFoods is because you have given your\nbody enough whole real foods that now\neverything in your biology\nneurobiologically your reward circuitry\nyour\nmicrobiome your satiety hormone\nthreshold all of these are now basically\ncreating a situation in which you like\nthose foods and then the caloric thing\nfits into that because the reason we're\neating excess calories the reason\nchronic nutrition is happening and the\nreason we are quite literally in the\nUnited States eating ourselves to death\nfor the first time in human history is\nbecause we're not eating real food and\nwe're eating 60 to 75% of our calories\nof ultra processed nutrient depleted\nfoods that\nfundamentally don't give our cells what\nthey need and a real premise that I\nthink is so important to realize is that\nour cells are brilliant and if the cells\naren't getting what they actually need\nto function properly they will drive you\nto eat until they get their needs met\nunfortunately\nbecause the ultra processed food is\ndesigned to be highly addictive and it's\ndevoid of what the cells actually need\nfor good function we end up eating\nourselves into a grave and now almost\n80% of Americans are overweight or obese\nclose to 50% of the country is obese we\nliterally gloss over this as a culture\nit has become so normal in such a short\namount of time but I always think about\nthe fact that like\nthere are really no other animal species\nin the world that have obesity and\nchronic disease epidemics and they don't\nhave social media they don't have\nexperts they don't have PubMed they\ndon't have the FDA they don't have the\nUSDA they don't have any of it and they\nhave somehow figured out a way to stay\nat a healthy weight and to not get heart\ndisease and it's because they're eating\nreal food that meets the needs of their\ncells and so I think to just boil that\ndown the root cause of the problem is\nthat we have a toxic food supply that's\nno longer filled with the molecular\ninformation that our body needs to know\nto be satiated and to function properly\nand so through the complex biology of\nsatiety hormones and neurobiology and\nmicrobiome function we are driven to eat\nso so so much more so truly the jumping\noff point for anyone on the quest to\nBetter Health is to eat as much real\nunprocessed food from good soil as\npossible and of really of any dietary\nphilosophy they want truly I I think if\nsomeone's eating real unprocessed food\nfrom good soil who is you know\nplant-based or who is keto they are\ngoing to have such a higher chance of\nmeeting their body's actual fundamental\nneeds and the good thing about biomarker\ntesting is they can track for themselves\nif they are having good cellular\nfunction with that strategy there's been\nstudies that have panned this out you\nknow we we know that the mor Ultra\nprocess food you eat the higher risk of\nobviously obesity but also chronic\ndiseases are but then of course there's\nan amazing study from Kevin Hall just\nrecently where he basically locked\npeople up at the NIH and he for two\nweeks he had them eat Ultra processed\nfood and for two weeks he had them eat\nreal food and people ate 7,000 more\ncalories in the two week period uh when\nthey were eating Ultra processed food\nversus the unprocessed food they were\nlocked at the NIH I've been to NIH quite\na bit um I don't it's it's great for a\nday job or a day visit I don't know that\nI want to be locked there that sounds\nlike a that sounds like the Stanford\nPrison prisoner experiment I say this\ntongue and Chic and with such admiration\nfor what he had to do but I think it's\nso amusing that you know we have this\ntotally Franken food toxic food system\nthat's that's largely Ultra processed\nand it took amazing Kevin Hall to\nbasically do an NIH you know funded\nstudy where people what I say by locked\nis that they were impatience at the NIH\nand every had ad Li you know unlimited\naccess to food during each of those two\nweek interventions so it was two weeks\nof ultra processed food two weeks of\nunprocessed or minely processed food and\nthey could eat whatever they wanted as\nmuch as they wanted in both groups and\nthen they would weigh every single bite\nthat was left on their trays so they\nknew exactly exactly how many calories\nthey ate and literally just giving\npeople this Ultra processed food which\nis devoid of what our bodies need and\nand therefore will drive people to eat\nmore they ate uh 500 calories more per\nday for a total of 7,000 calories more\nin that two weeks and they gained about\ntwo pounds and then lost two pounds in\nthe unprocessed Group which makes sense\nof course because a pound is about 3500\ncalories and so we have to do these kind\nof crazy studies just to prove what we\nkind of know is true which is that this\nUltra processed food environment that's\ncropped up over the past 50 years is an\nexperiment that has failed it has failed\nyou know close to 45% of kids are\noverweight or obese now like it's not\nworking and that really is uh the root\ncause so I think a lot of food is about\nquality and how do we actually really\nmeet the needs of of the cells so that\nour satiety hormones get secreted and we\nnaturally stop eating because just\ntelling people eat less calories but eat\nwhatever you want that's just doesn't\nwork we have to inspire the body to not\nwant to eat excess calories\nwhich we do by stimulating satiety\nhormones you know helping the microbiome\nsupport that process and then change our\nreward circuitry which is done with\nnutrient-rich the most nutrient-rich\nfood we can possibly get and that's why\nI mentioned the soil because our food is\ndrastically dep depleted of nutrients so\nwhen we look at that 70 metric tons of\nfood we're eating in the lifetime it's\njust fasting you that's that's the\ninformation for our body what it's going\nto be built from how it's going to\nfunction well right now 60 to 75% is\nultra processed so we slash the value\nbecause the ultr processing just like\nslashes the nutrients we slash the value\nof that 70 metric tons and then we have\ncrappy soil because our industrial\nagriculture system which means the the\nfood in some cases has 70% less of key\nmicronutrients in it so that 70 metric\ntons what's actually useful for our body\nbecomes so much smaller so what we want\nto do is basically expand and the value\nof that substrate we're putting in the\nbody and that means real food\nunprocessed from good soil meet the\nneeds of the cells naturally don't be\nhungry maintain a healthy weight um and\nyou know something I talk about is that\nwe could I mean we could talk about\nnutrition the biochemistry of nutrition\nall day but in my review of sort\nof the biology and the biochemistry like\nthere's five main things I think we can\nstrive for in our food that can really\nhelp meet the needs of our cells and and\nwhen it really comes there are obviously\nmore things our body needs but if we\nstrive for these five things we will\nultimately I think eat a really healthy\ndiet and that is fiber\nOmega-3s adequate healthy protein a good\namount of probiotics and high\nantioxidant sources and if we build our\ndiet around knowing a few things in each\nof those categories that we really love\nand stock our kitchen with it and make\nour meals a mixing and matching of each\nof those components and we get a good\namount of those\nwe will give the body a lot of what it\nneeds to have mitochondrial Health\nreduce chronic inflammation reduce oxy\nof stress it's interesting for me to\ntake a step back from nutrition as it's\ntypically presented and think about the\nbrain the hypothalamic circuitry that\ndrives hunger and satiety and things\nlike that and to map that on to what\nI've heard and I I believe to be true\nbased on my view of the literature which\nis that we are largely meaning these\ncircuits in the brain make us largely\namino acid foraging machines because we\nneed those amino acids in order to carry\nout metabolic processes and reconstruct\nany tissues that need repair and and\nRecovery not just from exercise but just\ndaily turnover um removal of waste Etc\num so we're foraging for amino\nacids unconsciously we're foraging for\nmicronutrients and of course we need\nmacronutrients we need enough energy\nfrom proteins fats and carbohydrates or\nsome either combination of the three I\nfeel like I'm sort of in the dying\ncategory of omnivores right I'm neither\nyou know I'm not meat-based and I'm not\nuh plant-based I'm omnivores I think\nmost people are omnivores actually but\nuh omnivores aren't discussed quite as\nquite as much as um the other categories\nat least not on social media but that\nyou know we're we think of ourselves as\ngetting hungry and wanting to eat um and\nI think eating the foods some of them I\nlisted off before like Meat and Fish and\neggs and vegetables and fruits and some\nI do like starches like you know rice\noatmeal some pastas some sourdough\nBreads and things I love butter who\ndoesn't love butter um of course none of\nthat stuff in excess olive oil but if\none looks at kind of that um\nBuffet of of options you realize you can\nget some high quality amino acids you\ncan get some high quality lipids you um\nprobably want to get more of them from\nolive oil than from butter but you can\nget the micronutrients you need provided\nthose food sources are healthy now\ncontrast that with a highly processed\ndiet or even a minimally processed diet\nand you can get the taste you can get\nthe macronutrients you can get the\ncalories but you don't meaning the brain\ndoesn't really have a sense of it can't\ndirectly map taste calories\nmicronutrients on um onto one another\nand so you can imagine that the neural\ncircuits and here I'm it's a little bit\nof hypothesizing SL conjecture but that\nthe neural circuits responsible for\nhunger and satiety\nwould get immensely confused by what's\nin a highly processed food right a\nSnickers bar if you like sweets tastes\npretty good but it's unclear what's in\nit except sugar except some you know\nit's got a certain Snickers bar taste\nright but if the circuits of the brain\nare really trying to drive us to get\namino acids and\nmicronutrients um for bodily health and\nrepair well then highly processed and\neven moderately processed food has just\ngot be pure confusion I'm sorry to go\nlong here but it reminds me of the of an\nidea I had once where like imagine if\nyou took a pill that in greatly\nincreased the level of dopamine\nnorepinephrine acetylcholine and\nserotonin all at once that's\npolypharmacology and it might make you\nfeel a certain way maybe good maybe bad\nand then afterwards you'd probably have\na bit of a crash from as the drug wore\noff no doubt you would but let's say you\nwanted more of that feeling you wouldn't\nreally know what to go look for because\nyou don't know what what was in it\nbecause it's poly pharmacology so I feel\nlike Pro highly processed food is\npolypharmacology whereas when you are\neating foods that create a more pure\nexperience of micronutrients amino acid\ncontent calories and taste those four\nthings map to one another that\nintuitively we can start to understand\noh I like this food and it's good for me\nand this is enough of it right I don't\nknow anyone who of reasonable size that\nthat eats like four ribeye steaks you\nknow they eat one I me I'm sure there's\nsome freaks out there that do that but\nyou know one you know even small piece\nof quality meat is very satiating yeah\nyou will self-regulate because the body\nlike every other animal in the world is\nexquisitly designed to regulate hunger\non a very intuitive level if we eat\nnatural food it's you know it's I think\nit's almost ridiculous to talk about\ncalories and isolation because the\nreason we're eating more calories is\nbecause we're eating ultra-processed\nfood and so but I love what you just\nsaid Andrew about the brain and the poly\nfaracy I think that literally is it's\nI've never heard that said and I think\nit's like processed food is like poly\nPharmacy of food it is the definition of\nprocessed food which I know you talked\nabout with Rob lusting the Nova four\ncriteria is literally it's breaking down\nFoods into these constituent parts that\nwere never meant to be separated from\neach other like the endosperm of a wheat\nkernel separate from the brand and the\nyou know the germ um and then take that\nand like a little science experiment\npair it up with all these other\nindividual components and synthetic\nchemicals that are made in a factory and\nput them together to create this thing\nthat the body I I I truly think our\ninsatiable hunger again we're eating\nourselves to death in the United States\nthat's the reality our insatiable hunger\nand our chronic disease epidemic\nfundamentally is a lot of it's It's Mass\ncellular confusion and when you think\nabout what chronic inflammation is\nchronic inflammation is biochemical fear\non the cellular level well when you put\nthis stuff into the body that's never\nseen before obviously that's going to\ngenerate some confusion and you know you\ncould you could trace that back to what\nthat really means with leaky gut and you\nknow all the sorts of the real\nphysiology of that but um there's a\nwonderful book that is called the end of\nCravings by Mark shatzer he also wrote\nthe Dorito effect but he talks a little\nbit what you're talking about which is\nideal that processed food is actually\nthe ultimate sort of food um based\nvariable reward so in the way that it in\nlike things that I mean I'm speaking the\nexpert here but things that the body\ncan't predict what the outcome is going\nto be are going to kind of get you in\nthat dopamine motivation pathway and\nthat's actually what processed food is\ndoing is it's every time we eat a\ndifferent ver we think we're eating a\ntortilla but it's like completely\ndifferent than all the other weird\ntortilla Ultra process tortillas on the\nShelf so every time we eat tortilla and\nour brain is this incredible prediction\nmachine and as it's coming towards our\nmouth we're predicting what the load is\ngoing to be but we have no idea is it a\nCoke Zero is it a Diet Coke with\nAspartame is it is it a regular Coke it\nall tastes the same but the nutrients\nthat our gut are totally different so we\nend up actually triggering the\nmotivation Pathways because of process\nfood representing a variable reward\nwhereas every time you eat a ribeye your\nbody is pretty much getting a similar\nthing each time and so the\nprediction um matching is going to be\nmore conducive to uh getting off the\nmotivation treadmill for more which I\nthink is so fascinating um but I think\nbacking up a little bit one one concept\nI have for food that really helps me is\nreally thinking about the body's always\ntrying to help me be satiated and trying\nto help reduce my Cravings I literally\njust have to give the body what it needs\nI have to stimulate the body in a way\nthat it will serve me in giving me\nsatiety hormones to basically regulate\nmy hunger and again with visuals I think\nit's so helpful I think about these\ncells lining our small intestine that\nliterally have nutrient sensors like and\nliteral receptors on the cell membrane\nin the luminal side of the gut that's\nfacing all the food that are just\nsitting there like waiting to bind with\nthese things in our food that will\nstimulate the cell to make the satiety\nhormone that poof effortly makes us not\nhungry gets rid of that grip of\nattachment to Cravings that all of us\nare so plagued by and like I think you\nknow we have this intense conversation\nhappening in society right now about gp1\nanaloges and OIC and mjara and all these\nthings gp1 Agonist but like you know we\nrarely talk about the fact that like we\nhave nutrient sensing cells of the gut\nthe L cells of the gut that when\nstimulated appropriately will make glp1\nand when stimulated the way they want to\nbe will secrete hordes of glp1 for us\nand so how do we actually think about\njust literally giving the body what it\nneeds to stimulate the society hormones\nand the processed foods aren't giving us\nthose things you know the things that\nare goingon to um stimulate those\ncells well well the things that will I\nmean this is kind of fascinating if you\ndon't mind going down a little road\ntalking yeah please with the gp1\nconversation I feel like so missing from\nthe conversation is the idea that like\nfrom a first principles perspective\nthere's three ways our body could make\nmore gp1 we make more cells that make it\nl cells of the gut each of those cells\nmakes more glp1 and importantly we can\nalso inhibit the inactivator of gp1\nwhich is an enzyme called dpp4 so gp1\nactually gets rapidly degraded by dpp4\nin the body so if we can figure out how\nto inhibit dpp4 we can raise our glp1\nlevels what is dpp4\nit's an enzyme that breaks down\ngp1 said that and I missed I apologize\nso fascinating and so how often have you\nseen in the headlines oh here's some\nstrategies to inhibit your dpp4 never\nbecause OIC is is you know on track to\nbe the highest grossing Med in human\nhistory and just like we talked about in\nthe beginning of the\nepisode the whole industry this4\ntrillion doll health care industry is\ndesperate for not us to not understand\nhow to do the things that drugs could do\nfor us so when we look at those three\nfirst principles approaches of how do we\nmake more L cells get them to produce\nmore glp1 from each L cell and then\ninhibit the breakdown through the\ninhibition of\ndpp4 for the first one we know that\nshort chain fatty acids which of course\nare the byproduct of microbial\nfermentation of fiber in the diet\nstimulates the differentiation of more L\ncells in the gut so more short chain\nfatty acids more L cells can we\ntranslate that into support the gut\nmicrobiome eat more fiber eat more fiber\nand um we had Justin sonenberg from\nStanford on a world expert in gut\nmicrobiome and he was a big proponent of\nbased on work he's done um with Chris\nGardner and others at Stanford so\nhappens of ingesting one to three\nservings of low sugar fermented foods\neach day things like sauerkraut kimchi\nagain low sugar variety is probably\nbest yeah maybe not you said not\nkombucha yeah cuz that's going to be\nlike the highest sugar of the fermented\nfoods which people often go to but now\nsod cly the sauerkraut you can actually\nmake your own sauerkraut Tim Ferris had\na great recipe for this in the 4our chef\nyou have to be careful because you know\nthat you can create some unhealthy\nferment you have to do it the way he\ndescribes so check out the the recipe\nit's online um or you can buy sauerkraut\nand the brins um drinking the brine off\nthe sauerkraut or off um seems to be\ngood for the gut that's such a great\npoint which is that\nultimately we want the short chain fatty\nacids which is the the the medicine that\nthe the microbiome are making for us\nthrough the microbial fermentation\nprocess and we can basically do that in\nthree ways one is we can eat more fiber\nwhich is prebiotics we can also eat more\npolyphenols because we're now learning\nthat the microbiome actually processes\nthey ferment polyphenols from our which\nis basically you'll find those in\ncolorful fruits and\nvegetables um spices teas cocoa things\nlike that so fermentation of polyphenols\nand fiber to short chain fatty acids\nwhich then we absorb um and then like\nyou just said in a fermented food the\nbacteria in that food will be making\nshort chain fatty acids by fermenting\nthe food in there and then if we drink\nthat we're getting the short chain fatty\nacids directly so that's the kimchi\nsauerkraut uh Greek yogurt kavass which\nI'm obsessed with which is like low\nsugar kambucha it's like made with\nfermenting beets basically good stuff\nit's such good stuff uh miso NATO so\nthat's one that has been shown to\ndifferentiate more L cells in the gut we\nalso know that people with 2 diabetes\nhave much fewer L cells in the gut and\nit's hard to know what the causality is\nthere but I think a safe assumption is\nlike if we keep our blood sugar under\nbetter control and sort of stay out of\nthat diabetic range it probably lends\nitself I don't know what the chicken in\nthe egg is there but blood sugar\nstability more L cell differentiation\nand then actually ginsing has been shown\nto um to improve l l cell\ndifferentiation so that's just sort of\none one set of things and I don't think\nthe dose on sing has been has been\nsettled but um very high antioxidant\ncomponent plant when we look at actually\nstimulating more glp1 you've talked\nabout your remate I think having like a\na mild effect on glp1 but there's\nactually a lot of other things um in the\nliterature protein of course Very\npotently stimulates these nutrient\nreceptor cells and specifically like\nveiling and glutamine seem to have a\npotent stimulatory effect on glp1 so\nyou're find that and like meat and\nturkey and eggs and things like that\nwhat are your thoughts on supplementing\nEl glutamine it's controversial I know\nthat some people do it um in an effort\nto relieve leaky gut but that's but\nthere aren't any randomized control\ntrials for that so the um depending on\none's stance on what's required for uh\nuh kind of a threshold for for adopting\nsomething you know some people say\nthat's crazy other people really swear\nby supplementing El glutamine maybe it's\nthrough this this route of increasing um\nL cells um that some of the gut relief\nmight might exist I guess we'd have to\nexplore it so that's speculative folks\num so this is interesting these are ways\nto increase the cells that then make gp1\nso fiber Prebiotic probiotic fiber and\nfermented antioxidants lowering blood\nsugar Jin saying so those are kind of\nthe L cell ones the actual secretion of\nmore\nglp1 the one of the most potent ones and\nthe study that looks at this like the\nbar graphs are very clearly\nstatistically sign significant lots of\nasteris is actually thids thids tell me\nmore about thid thids are so fascinating\nthids are actually a structure in plants\nthat are part of the chloroplasts so you\nknow chloroplast and this also is\nfascinating because chloroplasts are\nbasically the plant version of\nmitochondria essentially and thids are a\nmolecule in the chloroplast and there's\nactually been research that shows that\nwhen you eat about 100 gram of spinach\nwhich gives you five grams of straight\nthy covid over 12 weeks daily it led to\na a significant increase in glp1 and\nagain I don't remember the exact it was\ntwo or threefold higher um secretion so\nthis is in part so so so that's a direct\nstimulatory effect of the the L cells\nand so this is this equates to 3.5\nounces of spinach a day which is like\nnothing so just getting ra spinach or\ncooked spinach I think I actually I\ndon't think it actually it might have\nsaid in the methods but I I would\nimagine raw because you want to get\nthose undenatured thids in the gut so\njust kind of another actually thids do a\nlot of other interesting stuff they\ninhibit lipase in the gut and so\nactually help more fat get down to the\ndistal small bowel and promote satiety\nso this is one of the reasons why you\ntalk about oh the people who eat all\nthese healthy foods and greens they're\nless hungry it's like it's biochemistry\nlike there's stuff happening in there\nthat is making the hunger signals go\ndown through things like inhibiting\nlipase you know in improving gp1\nsecretion so other things for gp1\nsecretion the thids also Fiers has been\nshown specific amino acids so high\nprotein foods things that involve a lot\nof veine and glutamine uh green tea and\nspecifically the uh elic the EC um ecgc\nthat uh is one of the compounds in green\ntea that's been shown to stimulate glp1\ncurcumin um so there's several things\nthat are all in that like food you know\nbasically things you would associate\nwith a healthy diet but we actually know\nthey stimulate glp1 so I you know those\nare all things I try to include in my\ndiet and the last one is inhibition of\ndpp4 and that one there's just actually\nwhen you look at the research there's\nsome kind of random foods that tend to\ninhibit dpp4 um black beans Mexican\noregano other forms of oregano Rosemary\nguava and um I wrote this one down\nbecause it's a word I hadn't seen very\nmuch before I started digging into this\nbut mtin which is found in berries\ncranberries and peppers and and Swiss\nchards so all that is to\nsay\nultimately many of us are gripped by\ncravings and the idea\nof have you know just sort of not being\nconstantly driven to eat more which I\nwould argue that about 80% of Americans\nare feels really hard to overcome but a\nlot of it is literally just\ncommunicating to your CS in in a clear\nway through food to help you be satiated\nand the science can show us how to do\nthis and a lot of it comes down to\neating essentially what you were talking\nabout how you eat omnivorous protein um\nhealthy sources with nutrient you know\ndensity and lots of colorful fruits\nvegetables um\nspices herbs things like that um so yeah\nyeah it's interesting um again these\naren't randomized control trials nor are\nthey peer-reviewed studies but I have a\nfew friends who I've known for most of\nmy life who really struggled with their\nweight uh carried a lot of excess weight\nand we starting to suffer health issues\num in their even their 30s but in their\n40s I'm 48 so they're my peers and so\nthey're about that age range and they've\nall done extremely well meaning they\nlost a tremendous amount of body fat are\nterrifically healthy now by way of\nbasically restricting their uh food\nintake to proteins so fish and meat eggs\nfruits and vegetables they basically\njust cut out starches and um but I don't\nthink it was the starches per se I think\nit was the satiety that comes from\neating high quality protein fruits and\nvegetables and from limiting the number\nof Highly processed foods and actually\nthe toughest thing for all of them was\nto um stop asking me or themselves\nrather like can I include this condiment\nthis this you know and what's\ninteresting is all of them now seem to\nreally enjoy eating Foods in their more\npure form and I'm not somebody that like\npushes on this on my friends they just\ncome to me and say like how do I lose 50\nlbs with um without having to exercise\nit all off you know um as the only\nsource of of of weight loss they they\nall exercise as well but um it's just so\ndaunting to try and lose you know 20 30\n40 lounds and to do so quickly and then\nto keep it off cuz they've all had the\nexperience of going on a diet and then\nyou exercising a lot then um the point\nhere is that I really think there's\nsomething powerful about that\nrelationship between taste macronutrient\nvalue micronutrient value and um satiety\nyes I think there's really those\npowerful associations because the brain\nis such an associative machine uh one\nthing that I should have um said before\num and I know most people are familiar\nwith OIC yeah um and its commercial\nnames are I forget what the the um OIC\nis the commercial name and munaro and\nmovi and yeah got it um is that glp1\nacts more or less as an appetite\nsuppressant um powerful appetite\nsuppressant so um many millions of\npeople are now taking uh gp1 analogs is\nthat right I think there were over 20\nmillion pres scripts in the United\nStates wow last year is it expensive\nit's it's $20,000 per year does\ninsurance cover it typically uh right\nnow insurance is covering it for\nindications\num but there is a allout\nassault uh from the pharmaceutical\nindustry to essentially classify obesity\nas a genetic disease and a chronic\ndisease in order to be able to feed this\nmedication more into the insurance\npathway and essentially get more\ntaxpayer dollars to pay for this\nmedication um and it is extremely\nexpensive and it's on track to be the\nhighest grossy medication in history\nbecause uh it's now being recommended\nfor people with obesity type 2 diabetes\nand then the American Academy Pediatrics\nrecently has talked about giving this to\nchildren as young as 12 as part of the\nfirst line for\noverweight um and you know I think\nreally it's such a travesty based on the\nconversation we've had because what OIC\ndoes not do in any way shape or form is\nimpact the toxic environment that we're\nliving in that's hurting our\nmitochondria losing weight is different\nthan improving mitochondrial function\nand mitochondrial dysfunction is the\nroot cause of basically every chronic\nillness and symptom that's torturing\nAmerican lives today and so in many ways\nit represents like the ultimate Band-Aid\nfor an environment that is not changing\num and when you think about what we\ncould do with\n$220,000 per year and it's a weekly\ninjection so say well per person like oh\nit's and it's a medication that is\nintended to be taken for life because\nwhen people come off this medication\nmany people are gaining back all of the\nweight or even more weight afterwards\nand then there's been conversations\nPeter Tia is waiting on this about loss\nin lean mass you know part of the weight\nloss is disproportionately muscle and so\nthere's a lot of concerns about it um\nabove and beyond its ability to lower\nthe number on the scale that uh we\nshould all be very alert too because um\nyou know the reality is is that the 40\ntrillion cells in our body are in an\nenvironment in the western world right\nnow that is not conducive to core\nbiologic functioning and there is\nobviously no shot that can mitigate the\nmulti-front assault on our biology that\nultimately generates a body that's\nimmensely profitable for those 100\nSpecialties of healthare so you know\nwe're living in this this Matrix and\nthis game of you know a devil's bargain\nbetween a $4 trillion dollar Healthcare\nand pharmaceutical industry and a$6\ntrillion dollar processed food industry\nthat all want us to think that you know\nthe answer is found in a shot and we\ndon't need to change anything about our\nlifestyle but of course you know these\nsimple habits that we're talking about\neating real food moving walking Etc\ngetting out in the sunlight um rapidly\ncan inrease our mitochondrial capacity\nand um you know are just the most\ndisruptive thing that we can do you know\nin our culture today is is learn about\nmetabolic health and improve it and um\nit's it's just interesting to see what's\nhappening in the media with sort of the\nassault against these empowering habits\nand very in favor of uh a medication\nlike OIC and then when you trace you\nknow unfortunately incentives there a\nhuge percentage of these Outlets that\ncover you know OIC as a miracle drug\ntheir bills are paid by Pharma 60% of\nmainstream media advertising budget is\nPharma and so you know I just I just say\nthat because I think um it's it's a\nscandal um that we give so much air time\nto these medications and not to simple\nmetabolic habits that can make us feel\nyou know so incredible and and really\nchange our core biology so walking\nexercise eating minimally processed or\nnonprocessed Foods\num you also mentioned temperature yeah\nvery very interested in that but uh\nbefore we we go a little bit further\ndown the path of what one can do in\nterms of um having agency over their\nmetabolic Health um I just feel\nobligated to just entertain the\npossibility presumably somebody who's\nreally struggled with their weight a\nlong time um maybe because of excess\nCravings you know challenges in\nregulating their appetite or whatever we\ndon't know what the reasons are um maybe\nthey injured their knee and they can't\nexercise I mean this happens right um at\nleast not yet\num take a GP analog like OIC loses some\nweight probably loses some muscle also\none would hope that that would give them\nthe sense okay now I can move my body\nbetter I'll start exercising eating\nbetter as well I think that I have to\nimagine that there's a middle case\ncondition where people are not just\nrelying on Pharmaceuticals and not just\nrelying on um behavioral uh routes uh to\nimprove metabolic Health but can do both\nright I mean that and one would hope\nthey are if if they're already taking\nthese meds or is it the case that when\npeople have a pill or an injection or a\npotion that gives them the effect that\nthey want that they just remain\nsedentary I think we have to look at\nhistory here I mean you first of all\nthere have been other weight loss\nmedications throughout history that\nyou've talked about in the podcast like\nthe fenfen and then there was another\none I think even before that that made\npeople their temperature go up that you\ntalked about so the two these are I used\nto work on thermal regulation as an\nundergrad so uh fenfen was eventually\nbanned because it caused some cardiac\nissues I believe it was a stimulant F\nFlur me so um sorry it's not Fen Flur me\nit alone it's a combination of things\nthat's why it's called Fen Fen um and\nthen um dinitrophenol right which was um\nbased on the observation that workers in\nammunitions factories were being exposed\nto this stuff and losing a lot of body\nfat and weight um it actually made its\nway into the sports Community it's\nhighly deadly highly deadly just don't\neven don't even look it up it's highly\ndeadly don't because the moment people\nstart looking it up they started\nthinking about dabbling the way the\ninternet is now\ndinitrophenol um and I think it has to\ndo with with um sort of uh processing of\nthe of mitochondria I think this is\nhappening in the the electron chains in\nmitochondria so anyway or free\nelectron look it\nup excuse me um the bottom line here is\nthat um there have been plenty of drugs\nmostly stimulants used to help people\nlose weight and um or that have acted\ndirectly on the mitochondria it has not\nworked out well historically it just\nhasn't and I think that\nI'm not just going to lump it's a\ndifferent mechanism so I don't want to\nlump it in with past weight Lo loss\ndrugs however if you look at the trends\nthroughout history the\nmedicalization and pharmacology towards\nchronic issues has been an abject\nfailure I cannot I don't know of and I'm\nsure people can correct in the comments\nbut of a single chronic condition for\nwhich the explosion of the pill to treat\nand manage that condition has lessened\nthe rates of that condition the more\nssris you prescribe the more depression\nwe have the more metformin we prescribe\nthe more type 2 diabetes rates are going\nup the more OIC is being prescribed\nobesi is going up you know this is on\nWall Street they're\nnot this is on track to be a blockbuster\ndrug and they're not assuming the rates\nof obesity are going to go down that\nwouldn't actually make sense for the\nbusiness mod model I mean these are\nbeing talked about at the JP Morgan\nHealthcare conferences do you think\nthey're thinking that this is going to\nplummet no like there are I can't think\nof very many chronic conditions for\nwhich the explosion of the medication\nhas reduced the frequency of the disease\nthat's really something to think about\num and the reason is because of exactly\nwhat we started this conversation with\nthey're not actually truly impacting or\nhealing the root cause physiology in\nsome cases they're worsening that root\ncause physiology like they are inducing\noxidative stress they may help with the\nsymptomatic management um but not\nactually reducing that Trifecta that we\ntalked about in the beginning and so why\ndo we have reason to believe that\nmedicalizing obesity and not actually\ngetting at the root cause which has to\nbe impacted by multimodal gent gentle\nnudges in our daily life habits and\nenvironment that that's actually going\nto reduce the rates of the conditions so\nno that's very helpful okay so I'll then\nreturn to the other question about\ntemperature uh what are some things that\ncan do with temperature and by the way\nas I do this I I can't resist any longer\nuh Casey Dr means brought me this jar of\nblueberries people that know me know\nthat I um I'm a driveby blueberry eater\nso if there's blueberries out on a on a\ntable I'm going to take some I've never\neaten during a podcast but I'm going to\nnow so um I'll try and chew quietly do\nyou want some sure okay um um I love\nblueberry Beres and um no I don't eat\nthem one by one so I'm but I'm going to\ntry and eat them quietly so we'll keep\nthem here in the middle for the time\nbeing and I'm going to eat them by the\nhandful just cuz I got hungry and and\nyou mentioned berries earlier and it\ntriggered a a neural circuit for me so\nwhat about temperature people that know\nme or even that just listen to the\npodcast know that I like the cold shower\nthing cold plunge thing I don't do it\nevery day I don't do it after resistance\ntraining workouts for at least 6 hours\nand mostly keep it on days separate from\nthe resistance training\nbecause there are some data that can\ninhibit hypertrophy and strength um\nadaptations but I like it I like it it\nfeels good um I feel great afterwards\nfor many hours and I I believe there are\nsome health effects and um I'm willing\nto weather the storm uh of of naysayers\nbecause more and more data keep emerging\nthat that's the case um not all the data\nare spectacular yeah one paper on this\nactually was just retracted we need to\ndo an update um to an episode to um it's\nnot work from my lab but I still think\nthat there's a lot of really terrific\nwork on um deliberate cold exposure\nwhat's the deal with temperature and\nmitochondria so no one has basically\ndescribed this better than you I feel\nlike on your on your platform but I\nthink about it very very\nsimply throughout human history humans\nhave really in so many different parts\nof the world been exposed to hugely\nfluctuating temperatures like if you\nlook at the Sahara Desert or like a\nregular day in Colorado it's like you\ncan go from let's talk about s deser you\ncan go from 30° to 110 degrees in the\nspan of one day and like even the\nconcept of indoors is like a relatively\nNew Concept in human history four walls\nyou know insulation then Central Heating\nand Cooling that's like the last 50 75\nyears in most homes and so this\nidea our cells have evolved to respond\nto Big swings in temperature that very\nrecently we have totally pulled away and\nI think that when I think about the\nmitochondria and increasing their\ncapacity I'm thinking about well how do\nI use different energetic signals in my\nenvironment to essentially get the\nmitochondria to do better work and we\ncan think about all the different types\nof energies that we're exposed to solar\nenergy thermal energy acoustic energy\nmechanical energy you know food energy\nlike there's there's that's basically\nwhat our environment is right and\nthermal energy is a big one of those we\ncan speak to our mitochondria with the\nLang of thermal energy and say hey it's\ncold outside we need you to print more\nof yourselves or work harder such that\nwe can create heat inside the body to\nrespond to this stimulus and so that's\nkind of the framing that I use for it\nand like you know this data is hard to\nknow if it's totally accurate but like\nour population is is Cooling and some I\nthink it was Data Stanford actually that\nwas showing that like our temperature\nhas gone down like 2% or something like\nthat in the last 100 years and that\nfundamentally is mitochondria not\nworking as well as they should research\nhas shown we're making less ATP in a lot\nof our cells and that's you know\nfunction of mitochondrial dysfunction\none fun fact I don't know if you knew\nthis but uh the body makes about 88\npounds of ATP per day for like the\naverage American so we're constantly\nmaking it we're constantly recycling it\nin this like you know like basically\nmake it use it make it use it make it so\nfast that like we essentially don't\nchange our weight but but it's kind of\nand of course as it's being broken down\nHP to ADP we release heat and so I just\nthink of cold as like one of the tools\nin our tool belt to talk to the\nmitochondria to say make more heat and\nin a world in which our mitochondria\nUnder Siege I think it's a valuable\noften very inexpensive one that can we\ncan use of course it does not\nsupplement or replace food sleep\nexercise but I think it can be a very\nvaluable tool to stimulate you know\nthrough that signal to to basically make\nmore heat and you know we know of course\nit can help and it the data you know is\nis mixed but like incre increase Brown\nfat which is like mitochondrial dense\nfat and have it do more work and whatnot\nso ultimately Brown fat is mitochondrial\ndense fat and we want to you know help\npromote that so that's how I use cold\nand then on the heat side you know just\nfascinating how that's kind of acting to\nhelp metabolic Health um through the\nactivation of the heat St protein some\nof which have you know the ability to\nupregulate antioxidant defense systems\nand quell some of that wildfire that we\ntalked about that can hurt our\nmitochondria so um I put them lesser on\nmy list um but you know because we just\ncan't we can't avoid the food and you\nknow the sleep and and the movement but\nI think it's a great tool that we can\nuse I love it and I will just point out\nthat the reason the brown fat is Brown\nat all is because of the density of\nmitochondria it's literally Brown down\nthe microscope this is not the kind of\nfat that um is subcutaneous although it\nyou know it sits around the scapula neck\nupper back there's other um pockets of\nit on the body too and such an\ninteresting tissue um yeah I don't know\nwhy deliberate cold exposure is so\ncontroversial I think it's because\npeople who don't like it and frankly no\none likes getting in it the the best\npart is getting out and how you feel\nafterwards but I think it um nothing\nGres on people uh like deliberate cold\nexposure if they don't like deliberate\ncold exposure and there's no requirement\nfor it but I think it's a very\ninteresting stimulus and I think there's\nalso a very interesting relationship\nbetween light and temperature because in\nmost areas of the world as days get\nlonger meaning more sunlight available\ntemperatures go up um and nowadays we\ncan really divorce ourselves from all\nthis like day lengthening and shortening\ntemperature fluctuations which is not to\nsay that we should all be running around\nin a minimal amount of clothing Outdoors\nbut there's just such beautiful data\nfrom Dr Susanna soberg work um showing\nfor instance that deliberate cold\nexposure then leads to one feeling more\ncomfortable at cold temperatures because\nyou become a you know a essentially more\nof a furnace more more more Brown fat\nanyway we could go on and on but I think\nit's um yet another lever of of of\nautonomy in terms of taking control of\none's Health as you said um not as\ncritical as food intake and quality\namount and maybe timing as well um\nspeaking of timing what are your\nthoughts on fasting and then of course\nmovement and exercise yeah the way I\nconceptualize the idea of fasting\nobviously this is one where we we need\nmore work right because the word fasting\nis so limited there's so many different\nparts of this but skipping breakfast for\nme would be that or or skipping dinner\nsometimes I'll skip dinner sometimes\nI'll skip breakfast right um I think\nthat some of the most interesting data\nthat I've seen has been about if we\nreasonably compress our eating into\ndaytime hours during the heart of the\ndial cycle when we are supposed to be\neating so essentially matching our\nchronobiology with our Behavior which\nyou know we are dial organism so we kind\nof need to respect that like when we do\nthat and we compress it in a moderate\nway our metabolic health is better and\nso some of the studies that have looked\nat this one that was interesting was and\nI think very hopeful for people is that\nif you take all the food all the\ncalories that you're going to eat and\neat them in a sixh hour window versus a\n12-hour window totally same amount of\ncalories exact same food this is a\ncontrolled\nexperiment people who eat the same\namount of calories in a six-hour period\nare going to have much lower\nstatistically significantly lower\nglucose uh 24-hour glucose and insulin\nlevels compared to people who just space\nit out over the course of a 12-hour\nperiod and it makes sense because if\nyou're spacing that food out over the\ncourse of 12 hours that is a different\nbiochemical millu in your body\nthroughout the day it's kind of similar\nto The Walking you know it's like you\nare then stimulating insulin several\nmore times you are exposing the\nbloodstream to insulin and glucose just\nmore throughout the day um and giving\nthe bloodstream less of an opportunity\nto sort of be clear from that glucose\nand that insulin and so compressing our\neating Windows seems to be helpful uh\nfor for metabolic health and it's a bang\nfor your buck right like you can eat the\nsame amount of food you just have to eat\nin a shorter period of time so for\npeople who want to eat you know a lot\nmaybe just consider compressing it into\ndaytime hours six to eight hour window\nyeah for me six is tough the one meal\nper day thing is tough I have friends\nlike Lex Friedman that do the one meal\nper day I end up eating so much food at\nthat meal I experience a lot of like\nkind of like mechanical distress it's\ntypically later in the day I think an 8\nto 10 hour window has worked well for me\nmost most days um I know as soon as we\ntalk about intermittent fasting which is\nwhat or Tim restricted feeding same\nthing which is what we're talking about\nright now I'm sure somebody's going to\ncall up the um there's been a study\nthat's been circulating about a um\nmassive increase in cardiovascular risk\nin people doing intermittent fasting in\nparticular the six-hour feeding window I\njust want to point out we study as far\nas I know I could be wrong but as far as\nI know that study is still in abstract\nform it's not yet peer-reviewed yeah\nit's like the fact that um studies that\nhaven't been peer reviewed aren't even\nclose to being peer-reviewed are um are\nbeing like put out there as news stories\nis is really problematic because um I\ncan tell you as somebody who sat on the\neditorial Boards of many journals for\nmany years I still sit on a few reviewed\ncountless papers I've submitted and had\nto deal with reviews on countless papers\nthe fact of the matter is like until the\nreviews are done the revisions are made\nlike that paper may never see the light\nof day and it may end up in a journal\nthat you is barely worthy of a placem it\nmight end up in a high tier high quality\nJournal but it might not so because\nthere was quote unquote a study done\nmeans very little but it means\nespecially little maybe nothing until\nit's peer reviewed absolutely and the\nmethods were very poor in that study it\nwas a recall based study I think for two\ndays of of recall of people's diets\nwhich is notoriously very bad in terms\nof accuracy so yeah and I think I'm not\nin any way suggesting that a six-hour\nwindow is the optimal window I'm just\nsharing the data that suggests that\ncompressing the\nwindow uh seems to have a favorable\neffect and I certainly don't do six\nhours but I think when you look at what\nthe average American is doing which is\nthe average American has 11 eating\nevents per day and 50% of Americans eat\nover a 15h hour window per day I can\nrecall those because I remember when I\nwas writing the book I I was like that's\na long time 15 hours and 11 events and\nand every time you're doing that you're\ngoing to be stimulating this glucose in\nthe bloodstream explo exposing the blood\nvessels to that glucose you're going to\nbe turning on all the pathways with\ninsulin to basically store it or you\nknow and it's so it's it's strain for\nthe body and so I think giving the body\ntimes intentionally to allow insulin to\ncome down and to allow glucose to come\ndown what that does is it generates\nmetabolic flexibility it gives our body\nan opportunity to have space to use\naccessible glucose and then convert into\nusing stored fat but be and that\nultimately is metabolic flexibility the\nability for the body giving the body\nopportunities to use glucose but then\nhave times when there's not high glucose\nand Insulin around to actually get into\nthe fat stores and I think one of the\nreasons why we have such a massive\noverweight and obesity you know rates in\nthe country is because with the way the\nculture of eating right now 11 eating\nevents per day eating over the course of\n15 hours per day I would imagine the\naverage American body is rarely if ever\ntapping into their fat stores for energy\nand a meaningful way because we always\nhave glucose available to the body if\nyou think about again the stats about\nultr processed food um about 70% of the\nthe items on the shelves in the grocery\nstore Ultra processed food and those\nultr processed foods are built on\nrefined added sugars and refined added\ngrains so we're just we very rarely give\nthe body the opportunity to rest and and\nmove into fat burning and that's where\ncompressing the eating window can be\nvaluable um obviously people have talked\nabout this before but fasting can be a\nstress for the body especially if your\nbody's not used to using fat for energy\nand so it's something to ease into and\ngo slow but I think if you're slowing\ndown enough to really hear what your\nbody's signal are saying you can kind of\nknow whether I think your fasting is\nworking for you or not I I can tell I've\ngot too many other things going on I\nhaven't slept well lot of stress I can\ntell that fasting is kind of making me\njittery and not feel good versus if I'm\nreally if I have good capacity I can\nfeel that it's actually making me feel\nreally incredible and so tune in with\nyour body obviously and you know you can\ncheck your biomarkers if you have a CGM\non you can see what's happening to your\nglucose if you have a ketone monitor you\ncan see what's happening to your ketones\nand really actually track which I think\nmakes fasting actually even even more\nfun I'll mention one other piece of data\nthat I think is actually really kind of\nfun as well with timing of eating um\nthere was a study that looked at people\nwho ate the exact same meal at 9:30 a.m.\nor 8:30 p.m. so basically after dark\nessentially in the part of the dial\nphase when we probably shouldn't be\neating versus early in the morning 9:30\num and the glucose and Insulin responses\nfor the same meal at 8:30 p.m. were\nsignificantly higher than when eating at\n9:30 a.m. and so again banging for your\nbuck it appears that eating in that\nearlier part of the day when we're\nactive and our chronobiology is set up\nfor metabolism and activity we have a a\nlower glucose and insulin response\nthere's also some evidence that\nmelatonin um which is secreted you know\nas we get closer to sleep um has\nsomewhat of an effect on impairing our\ninsulin sensitivity transient and so we\nmay actually just be not absorbing the\nglucose from those meals effectively\nlater at night so I tend to kind of move\na little bit more a little bit more low\ncarb I I would say throughout the day\nbased on that data and what I've seen on\nmy continuous glucose monitor basically\njust higher spikes for the same meal\nlater in the day so why not just kind of\nmove it up earlier very interesting\nsomething I'll I'll definitely try I\ntend to push my carbohydrates to a\nlittle bit later in the day for sake of\nsleep um unless of course I've done\nresistance training which I do three\ntime I aim to do three times a week and\npost resistance training I try and get\nsome start carbohydrate in me um just to\nreplenish glycogen and that's um then\ntends to reduce my carbohydrate craving\nlater in the day I love bread and butter\nbread and olive oil pastas and the other\nday I found this Argentine place and I\nlove the steaks there but they had Mii\nthat it took everything I had every\nneural circuit in uh that releases Gaba\ninhibition to my brain to not order\nthree of those ORD it was so good but\nyou can walk after the no yeah sure I'll\nallow myself to do those things I'm not\nsuper restricted but again I to eat high\nquality foods by the way these\nblueberries are amazing um I need to\nfigure out where you got those cuz\nthey're just Tangy enough um I'm doing\neverything I can to just not take the\njar and funnel them into my into my\nmouth um yeah I think you know if if\nwe're looking at blood sugar blood\nglucose and Insulin um and as as long as\nwe're talking about that I I did use a\nlevels tracker and yeah full disclosure\nthey're sponsor of the podcast regularly\nand I I learned a ton I'll tell you tell\nyou what I learned I I learned that um\nindeed my blood sugar goes up after I\neat um that certain foods although the\nfoods that did this surprise me um\ncertain foods tend to spike my my blood\nsugar um quite a bit um grapes that\nshouldn't be surprising um Foods food\norder was very powerful for me I know\nthat the dayon food order are a little\nbit mixed and it's controversial but um\nI like to eat like the French I like\nsome soup then I like my entree I like\nthe salad at the end that turned out to\nhave the steadiest um and lowest rise in\nblood glucose for me and then across\ntime I also found that um I love hot\nsauna I go um so hot with the sauna that\nI've been accused by Rogan and other\npeople I'm going to turn myself into a\nbrisket um but um after the sauna my um\nblood sugar spikes presumably because\nI'm a bit dehydrated and it's the\nconcentration of blood glucose is that\nis that possible does that make sense it\ndoes make sense but also the heat can\naffect the accuracy of the sensor itself\nah okay so that could be it too but yeah\nbasically what it allowed me to do is\nmake a few adjustments in terms of foods\nthat I eliminated or eat less of food\nordering within a meal and I find that\nI'm very susceptible to um if I don't\ninclude enough fat dietary fat in the\nmeal then my blood glucose spikes even\nif it's just like tuna right but by\nincluding olive oil and other things it\nreally blunts it and of course here\nwe're doing correlative um anic data but\nfor me I felt far better when I included\na bit more fat um and when the food\norder was adjusted the way I mentioned\nbefore always including a little bit of\nfiber really helped it and that makes\nsense right slow the absorption of the\nfood presumably um so I I found that it\nwas a very valuable experiment for me\nagain this isn't an advertisement it\njust so happens I did this and and\nreally benefited from it um what are\nsome other things that one can learn\nfrom continuous monitoring of blood\nglucose what are some things to watch\nfor that might signal a problem and what\nare some fun things that one could do to\nexplore an experiment because I like to\nexplore an experiment yeah well I mean a\nlot of the things that you just\nnaturally learned are the things that\nhave been shown in data and and like you\nsaid some of this data it's like small\nstudies small groups of people but for\ninstance adding fat and fiber to meals\nhas a significant and repeatable impact\nin populations on lowering gluc response\nuh fat probably in some part due to\nslowing uh gastric emptying and actually\nslowing the diges process so the rise in\nthe bloodstream is going to slow down\nand then fiber both for that reason but\nalso because fiber can in a sense create\nlike a mesh sort of blocking the\nabsorption of some of the glucose that's\nin the meal so literally kind of\nactually preventing you from absorbing\nall of the carbs and we've actually seen\nthat in the levels data set that the\nmore fiber people include with their\nmeals we see essentially a direct\nrelationship with lowering of their\ntheir glucose excursions which is really\nexciting because fiber is something that\nyou can add to meals very easily I put\nbasil seeds chia seeds hemp seeds flax\nseeds on a lot of my food at this point\nbecause it's essentially a little bit of\nfat a lot of fiber uh and it's kind of\njust helps you kind of get more from\nyour from your meal um so what you can\nlearn so I think step one the way I\nthink about a glucose monitor first of\nall I'll say the purpose of the glucose\nmonitor is not to have to game the\nsystem and get flat glucose the purpose\nof the glucose monitor is curiosity it's\nto start to understand\nhow it's essentially an MRI for how all\nof our different dietary and lifestyle\nstrategies are creating this readout of\nglucose in our body which I think can be\nreally interesting and in a world where\nso many cards are stacked against us\nwith diet and lifestyle and where\nthere's a lot of confusion about what's\nright for us that can be like very\nhelpful in actually reducing the\nconfusion and the cognitive load of our\nchoices we know\nthat keeping your blood sugar through\nthe course of a lifetime in a low and\nhealthy range so I don't mean up and\ndown spikes during the day but keeping\nyour blood sugar healthy throughout the\ncourse of your lifetime is probably the\nbest thing we can do for longevity\nstaying insulin sensitive staying out of\nthe diabetic range and so one thing that\nthe glucose monitor does for us is just\nus more uh awareness and agency into\nlike what the trends of our glucose are\nover time as opposed to a literally one\nDaya Point snapshot once a year in the\ndoctor's office which is what the\nmajority of us are used to um I really\nlove the idea that people who are able\nto wear glucose monitors every now and\nagain maybe once a year maybe more than\nonce a year they know what their glucose\nis and so they're never going to walk\ninto to a doctor's office and have a\nbomb dropped on them about pre-diabetes\nor type 2 diabetes because you have the\ndata which is ultimately I hope the\nworld that we can move towards for a lot\nof biomarkers so you can see Trends over\ntime which I think is very valuable one\nthing that's fascinating in terms of\nearly prediction of metabolic disease is\nthat you can see how long it takes your\nglucose to come down after a meal so in\na normal healthy insulin sensitive body\neven if the glucose goes way up it\nshould come way down very quickly\nbecause the insulin is buying to insulin\nreceptors and the glucose is getting\ntaken up and it it'll lower what is\nquickly over the course of it should be\ndown by two hours but from what I've\nactually seen in our like most insulin\nsensitive people and also in research\nthat looks at young healthy populations\nyou should basically be spiking and\ncoming down Spike about 45 minutes and\ncome down hour and a half 90 minutes to\ntwo hours but if this is after sorry\nafter last bite after last bite although\nit's hard to kind of exactly but yeah is\nover I would say about 45es to go up to\nthe and\nthenly now if you start to see that\nglucose is going up and then trailing\nvery slowly back down to normal maybe\ntaking more than two hours three hours\nthat is going to be one of those early\nindicators of potential insulin\nresistance your body's not clearing the\nglucose but that's not a metric that we\nuse in standard\npractice at all and I've actually seen\nmyself very insulin sensitive my insulin\nis like 2.5 and you know if I don't\nsleep and I am stressed and I have been\nsitting my glucose will take way longer\nto come down I have become transiently\ninsulin resistant so I think that's just\nfascinating to see that so looking what\nthat ultimately the metric that we call\nthat is area under the curve you want a\nlow area under the curve a you see after\na glucose Spike so you want to spike and\ncome down quickly that's going to be if\nyou shade the area under the curve it's\na small amount if you go up and then\nTrail off for two to three hours um\nthat's going to be a lot of shading\nunder that curve and high Au is\nassociated with insulin resistance\nbasically another thing that you can see\num\nis essentially glycemic variability and\nglycemic variability GV is a metric of\nhow spiky your curves are fasinating\npaper out of Michael Schneider's lab uh\nat Stanford in 2018 called glucotype\nreveal new patterns of glucose\ndisregulation totally Landmark study but\nbasically they put continuous glucose\nmonitors on non-diabetic individuals who\nby standard criteria of diabetes do not\nhave diabetes and he showed that on a\nCGM a continuous glucose monitor you\nhave these low variability people that\nare pretty much flat throughout the day\nwith little teeny little teeny Rolling\nHills after their meals you have\nmoderately spiky people and then you\nhave very spiky people who are going up\ndown up down up down up down when you\ncorrelate those different patterns of\nglycemic variability in non-diabetic\npeople you find that the spikier they\nare the worse their biomarkers are\nmetabolically across the board insulin\ntriglycerides Etc so basically they're\nthey're showing signs through\nvariability of underlying dysfunction\nthat you would never know from a\nstandard test those are the people who I\nimagine are probably going to go on to\ndevelop diseases and yet based on\nstandard criteria their doctors telling\nthem that they're fine that they're all\nthe same so he also showed in that study\nthat non-diabetic individuals when you\nhave a CGM on are going into the\ndiabetic range and the pre-diabetic\nrange a fairly significant amount and we\nwould never know that if you weren't um\nif you weren't actually tracking like a\nmovie of the glucose so that's so\nglycemic variability um area under the\ncurve those are two things another\nreally interesting thing you can know\nfrom a CGM is Dawn effect so Dawn effect\nis basically a term in the literature\nfor how high your glucose Rises right\nwhen you wake up in the morning I don't\nknow if you noticed this when you were\nwearing a CGM but some people notice\nthat the second they wake up their\nglucose jumps up 5 10 20 30 points\nWhat's Happening Here is that the\ncortisol Awakening response to actually\nget you to wake up and get out of bed\nthat cortisol can cause you to dump a\nbunch of glucose from your liver because\nit's basically saying stress hormone\ncortisol we got to get up we need\nglucose to fuel the muscles let's dump a\nlittle\nglucose so it's it's normal but what the\nresearch shows is that magnitude of dawn\neffect is correlated with insulin\nresistance so the more the dawn effect\nyou're getting I think it can signal\nmaybe the more stress you're under the\nmore cortisol you have floating around\nhow big your cortisol Awakening\nresponses but also if you imagine if\nyou're dumping all that glucose from\nyour liver and your cells aren't taking\nit up well because you're insulin\nresistant that that response that Dawn\neffect is going to be higher\nso I I don't have the numbers right in\nfront of me but typically I I would want\nto see a dawn effect I think of like\nless than 10 points so you wake up and\nyou you may very well see a rise this is\nabsence of any food yet and you do not\nwant to see that going up 20 30 40\npoints um some people see a little bump\nagain with caffeine in the morning\nbecause it's more cortisol and so that's\nanother thing that standard stuff would\nnever tell you so those are kind of some\nof the looking at early predictors of\nmetabolic dysfunction more of the fun\nstuff is like actually just figuring out\nlike how is food affecting your body and\nthis is where people really enjoy it and\nlike figure out like oh my God this food\nthat I thought was healthy is actually\nnot you know serving me and actually a\nlot of people I think who are trying to\nmake healthy choices my boyfriend like\nhe when we started dating he started\nusing levels his healthy snack he worked\nin Venice would be to go to Moon Juice\nand get oh gosh I I don't want to throw\nMoon Juice on the bus here but he would\nget tasty stuff they do but he would get\nthis green juice that was sweetened with\ndates and it was like $9 and this was\nlike the healthy choice and he saw the\nsecond he put on levels that it was\ncausing a huge Spike like 50 60 70\npoints and then he was\ncrashing um and he was actually trying\nto make a good decision so now he's he's\nswapped his snacks out for more like you\nknow grassfish cheese and some flax\ncrackers and maybe like a venison stick\nor something like grab and go stuff that\nisn't spiking as glucose but I think it\ncan help people figure out like which\nfoods are doing what I want them to do\nand which maybe aren't um and same thing\nhappened for so many of our members with\noatmeal unfortunately oatmeal instant\noatmeal is one of the biggest spikers in\nour data set for breakfast and a lot of\npeople are making that choice because\nthey think it's heart healthy and in\nmany people it's actually causing a big\nGL glucose Excursion and crash and then\nin some other people it's not and so\nit's it's really helping with um what\nare the sneaky spikers and then where's\nthe biochemical individuality and there\nwas a phenomenal paper out of um uh um\nIsrael that from from cell about seven\nyears ago called uh personalized\nNutrition By prediction of glycemic\nresponses it made big waves but it\nbasically showed that you and I could\neat the same handful of blueberries and\nhave totally different glycemic\nresponses so the idea of glycemic index\nas like a certain amount of food with a\ncertain amount of glucose causes a\ncertain glucose rise it it kind of\ndebunked that and that matters because\nrepeated sustained glycemic variability\nover time is not good for our health we\nwant to choose the foods or balance the\nfoods that are going to keep us\nrelatively more stable um so that that's\nthat's very helpful just understanding\nyour personal respon to food and then\nwhat are the lifestyle strategies you\ncan use sleeping better walking after\nmeals more resistance training cold\nplunging breath work that can actually\nserve to modulate the food environment\nto actually reduce the glucose spikes\nand people find that all of those things\ncan positively impact glucose spikes\nespecially the walks after the meals but\num to fascinating to see a lot of women\nespecially like menopausal women in our\ncommunity who find that their glucose\npattern are getting worse because\nestrogen's dropping and that's going to\nyou know really take a hit on insulin\nsensitivity they start resistance\ntraining glucose comes kind of right\nback down so because of the monitor they\ncan feel more confident in the\nintervention they've chose to do to help\nwith metabolism that kind of creates a\nvirtuous cycle so um so those are some\nof the big things those are big can I\nmention one more I'm so I know I love I\njust I could obviously talk about this\nall day think fascinating but this is\njust one more that I think is\nfascinating because this was a paper in\nnature from last year that talked about\nand this might actually be one of the\nmost valuable things to people which is\nthat again talking about Cravings we all\nwant to get off the craving grip this\npaper in nature showed that essentially\nwhen people Spike their glucose with\nhigh carb High starchy Foods they'll\noften have a big crash afterwards and\nthe reason for that is because a big\nspike leads to a lot of insulin\nsecretion and then you soak up all the\nGL glucose and sometimes you can\nactually go below your Baseline so a\nsmall Spike usually won't lead to a\ncrash but a big spike often will that's\ncalled reactive hypoglycemia\npostprandial\nhypoglycemia a lot of people think\nthey're dealing with hypoglycemia when\nin fact what they're really dealing with\nis that they're spiking their glucose\ntoo high and then they're crashing I see\nand the paper showed that the extent of\npostmeal dips the crash after the spike\nwas pred predictive of 24-hour energy\nintake and cravings for carbohydrates\nand this makes sense if you crash low\nthat is a signal to your body we have to\nget our glucose back up and it it will\ndrive you to eat high energy foods\ncarbohydrate rich foods and Cravings so\none of the best things we can do I I\nbelieve from my personal experience from\nMembers experience and with some data to\nsupport this is that one of the adjuncts\nwe can use to monitor our to manage our\nCravings is actually to like lower the\nthe the extent of our spikes so that we\ncrash less and so that was a fascinating\nstudy looking at CGM data that's\ninteresting so the cgms can reveal\nthings not just in the immediate meal\nperiod but can relate to sort of\nDownstream uh consequences yeah again I\nfound it to be tremendously useful I'm\nso glad you mentioned sleep by the way\nI'm going to resist the temptation to\nRattle off 20 studies showing that oh\ngod um you know even having um too much\nbright light in a room while one is\nsleeping at night even dim light which\nis you know I don't want to scare people\ninto thinking they have to sleep in\ncomplete darkness although an eye mask\ncan be can be great um can alter uh\nmorning blood glucose levels in I\nbelieve it was adults and kids as well\nthis a study in proceedings in the\nNational Academy of Sciences uh have to\ngo back and check if it included kids\nbut um pretty striking and then it's\nthere's something very clear about the\nfact that when people get the early\nnight sleep of four to 5 hours but then\ndon't get the\ndominating um you know last hour or two\nof sleep in the morning that resting\nblood glucose is is altered it's so\ninteresting to think about what's going\non in sleep there's at least one paper\nthat I'm aware of where they had people\nbreathing into a tube during sleep to\nmeasure what sorts of um met metabolism\nthey were undergoing and it's\ninteresting during a full night's sleep\num all of us seem to transition between\num different forms of metabolism I'll\nsend you this paper it's really it's\nreally cool and I'll put a link to in\nthe show note caption such that at one\nportion of the night we're met\nwe're rely more on let's just call it\nsugars for a sake of Simplicity other\ntimes we're more Ketone dominant there's\na a market shifts in metabolism\nthroughout the night it's almost like\nthe brain and body cycle through all the\ndifferent modes of of metabolism\nthroughout the night and then almost\nlike a rehearsal of the metabolic\npathways if you know we can\nanthropomorphize a bit here but then if\num sleep is truncated it clearly has an\neffect on daytime uh fuel regulation um\njust so interesting so um getting\nsufficient sleep getting quality sleep\nis is absolutely key there's a lot for\npeople to pay attention to but you've\ngiven us a lot of tractable avenues for\npeople to do that um that are mostly\nbehavioral there's a few don'ts but\nmostly some dos yeah yeah we haven't\nmentioned that um you know you don't\nneed to even perhaps belong to a gym\nit's like and with the cold uh exposure\nthing I always say you know if anything\nit'll save you money on the heating bill\nso um there's a there's a literally NE\npotential negative cost there um I think\nlevels and other cgms are really\ninteresting and value\num to experiment with what sorts of\nother stuff is going to soon be\nmonitored in our blood because for\ninstance I would love to know continuous\nhormone levels lipid levels blood blood\nsugar levels I mean are we moving past\num just blood glucose and are are there\nsoon to be other um things in these\nmonitors so that when we and by the way\nif you haven't used this it's really\ncool you just take your phone you scan\nit over the the sensor and then it\nbasically gives you a chart graph of of\nwhat's going on in your bloodstream and\nnow they're all the latest gen of each\nof them are all Bluetooth now so no more\nscanning which is kind of nice and the\nanswer is yes there're are several\ndifferent um analytes that we're going\nto be able to track and uh Abbot which\nis one of the three main manufacturers\nof cgms has announced that they're they\nhave a new product called the lingo\nwhich is going to actually be able to\nmeasure ketones lactate and alcohol um\ncontinuously which is pretty interesting\nfrom like a metabolic comprehensive\nmetabolic standpoint different sensors\nfor each not all in one so I think we'll\nhave to like polka dot ourselves if\nwe're tracking all those things um and\nthen Dexcom which is the other main\ncompany that makes cgms has just\nannounced they're coming out with an\nover-the-counter non-prescription\nversion of a CDM CGM called the Stell\nlater this year so there's exciting\nthings happening in the industry and I I\nreally do think um continuous monitoring\nit's it's going to expand to a lot these\nother things that you're talking about\nhormones Etc and I mean it it it really\nneeds to I think that um you know\nsnapshots of dynamic system are just\nnever going to really be able to give us\na full picture on what's going on and um\nwhat we really want to be able to do to\ndig our way out of this Health Care\ncrisis I think is is empowerment\nindividually and understanding how this\nrapidly changing environment is\naffecting our own biology so we can make\nthe targeted choices to hopefully change\nthe environment to be more conducive to\nCellular health and continuous\nmonitoring is a closed loop bio feedback\nthat can that can help us with that\ndecision- making and and essentially\npredict failure of the system rather\nthan wait for failure of the system\nbefore we do something about it so yeah\nI think lot's coming down the pipeline\nlove it\nyeah let's talk a little bit about\nmindset this is a really interesting\ntopic that you included in your book\nwe've had guests come on and talk about\ngrowth mindset stress can be enhancing\nmindset I'm big on mindset um because\nI'm interested in how our cognitive\nreframing or cognitive framing can just\nchange the way our biology works and\nvice versa of course um but you talk\nabout mindset in a certain context and\none of the um favorite passages around\nthat that I really enjoyed was the\nrelationship between kind of like trying\nto control everything and nature you\nknow like and uh and how uh getting into\nnature uh itself um can be valuable for\nus so maybe touch a little bit on\nmindset if you will and um yeah what are\nyour thoughts on nature literally\ngetting out of doors\nyeah so I think I think that\nmindset and more broadly than mindset I\nthink psychology and our relationship\nspecifically with fear and control I\nthink they're probably the most\nunderrecognized\nthing that is impacting the metabolic\nHealth crisis the chronic disease\nepidemic there has been data that's\nlooked into this we know that there's\nstudies showing that loneliness impacts\nmitochondrial function and that\nloneliness is a risk factor and stress\nis a risk factor and these things and\nsomething really fascinating actually\nwith the CGM data is that many people\nwho wear a CGM I don't know if you saw\nthis but when you feel stressed it\nactually has a diabetogenic effect it\nliterally causes our blood sugar to go\nup when we feel stress and that can be a\nfascinating um unlock for people to\nrealize I kind of feel like I'm okay\nright now but my body is telling me\nsomething different it's telling me that\nbiochemically I'm actually releasing\nenergy stores from my liver glucose to\nfight some threat that you know I wasn't\nreally aware of so there's there's we\ndefinitely understand there's this link\nhere but but it's certainly not made its\nway into clinical practice so the way I\nthink about it is that what we know\nabout the cells and especially the\nmitochondria is that the mitochondri\nmore than the PowerHouse of the cell\nthey actually\nare a part of the cell is constantly\ntracking resources and threats and are\nbasically modulating energy resources\nbased on that and the threats can be\nanything they can be a virus they can be\nand this is all coordinated through this\nthing called the cell danger response it\ncan be a virus it can be a toxin in the\nenvironment it can be lack of\nmicronutrients for the electron\ntransport chain that it needs to do its\nfunction it can also be psychological\nthreats because of course our\npsychological milu translates through\nnerves and hormones and\nneurotransmitters and our microbiome to\naffect our cellular biology throughout\nour whole body our cells hear every\nsingle thought that we're thinking\nthrough\nbiochemistry and when a cell and a\nmitochondria are getting the message\nthat there is a threat or something to\nbe afraid of they are going to change\nmetabolic function towards defense alarm\nthreat response and away from repair\nhomeostasis build building essentially\nthriving so our and and and I think\nwhat's really maybe the most unnatural\nthing about our modern world you know\nthe food of course is unnatural 70% is\nultra processed but we also have this\ndevice in our\nhands literally with us all the time\nstreaming fear inducing media into our\nbrains and eyeballs every waking moment\nof the day if we let it so we're glued\nto our screens and our devices and right\nnow essentially the traumas and fears of\neight billion people all over an entire\nGlobe are now ours to process and our\ncells and our mitochondria there is no\nescaping it they are going to respond to\nthat and so I think a big part of the\nmetabolic Health conversation\nis how do we create a sense of safety in\nour bodies no matter what is happening\nout out side of our bodies and this can\ncome down to every person's Journey will\nbe different for this because the things\nthat cause a sense of threat or fear for\nany two people are going to be different\nand I think some of the main categories\nis\none unresolved childhood trauma like\nsomething that I think is getting a lot\nmore talked about these days but like\nwhat's embedded in our nervous system\nthese limiting beliefs and memories that\nare really wired that create a sense of\nhypervigilance in US sort of all the\ntime what's coming in through our\ndevices our phones our computers the\nmedia that we're exposed to that's\nconstantly giving a fear signal and I\nthink on a broader level a big Western\none that we don't talk about is\nliterally like existential feel of fear\nof mortality we have a very Des\nspiritualized very\nuniquely death fearing culture like you\nlook at other\ncultures Eastern indigenous the stoics\nthey all had intense curiosity about\ndeath we talk about the cycles of life\nthere's this real\nengagement with it that we are so afraid\nof in the in the western system to the\nextent that our entire healthc care\nsystem actually I think you know we've\nbuilt it around like we're not going to\nwe're we're not going to help you thrive\nwe're just going to do whatever we can\nto make sure you don't die like that's\nit's built in everywhere and so we've\ngot the devices we've got the childhood\ntrauma we've got the fear of mortality\nwe have a very poor system of\nmental health care in the culture and I\nthink that through all these things\nAmericans are getting crushed mindset\nand psychology wise and that is a big\nbig trigger of our mitochondria\nessentially diverting resources towards\ndefense threat and alarm rather than\nhomeostasis building repair so again it\ncomes back to taking really honest stock\nof what are the true fear triggers in\nour lives across those and\nothers and creating a sense of safety in\nour minds and bodies no matter what the\nexternal world looks like which may mean\nputting boundaries up to you know the\nmedia doing the therapy doing the\ndifferent modalities what I believe and\nI talk about in the book getting back to\nthe question about nature is one of the\nbest things that we can do is actually\nliterally just go outside and I it\nsounds so simple but\none of the most astonishing stats I\nliterally found in researching this\nentire book was that the average\nAmerican is spending 93.7% of their time\nindoors wild\n93.7 that's in a car or in a building so\nwe are locked in these cages staring at\nfear inducing media and our mitochondria\nare\nlike what like what I don't know where\nto channel my energy it's just I it's\nshort circuiting I think so many things\nhappen when we go outside as you know I\nmean even what the vision system is\ndoing to our anxiety levels we are\ngetting sunlight which of course for uh\nfor you know complex reasons is very\nhelpful for our metabolic Health\nseparately entrains our you know\nchronobiology and uh you know light\nlight from the sun as an incredible\nregulator of our mitochondrial function\num but it also it's our best teacher you\nknow when we're out nature and we really\nlook at how beautiful the world is and\nthe cycles of nature we see the cycles\nof you know the the seasons and we see\nthe awe of the sun and the trees and\njust this all this Alchemy that's\nhappening outside of us we see you know\nspring to Summer to fall to winter we\nsee the tides moving in and out\neverything's in phases and I think when\nwe reflect and meditate on all the\ncycles and the polarities in nature\nnight and day cold and hot new moon you\nknow quarter moon full moon you know all\nthese things it's actually it it\nentrenches on a subconscious and\nconscious level that there is a\nfundamental Harmony and pattern to the\nworld we're living in that is bigger\nthan us and that is fundamentally good\nand beautiful um and we are locked\ninside of the Four Walls of our house I\nthink we get very scared we get very\ncontrollable and the system wants it\nthat way because when we are scared and\nwhen we are existentially afraid we will\nliterally do anything we will buy\nanything do anything watch anything that\nwill in some way ameliorate that pain\nthat we're feeling and we will take any\npill we'll get any surgery anything that\nmakes us feel like we're controlling\nthis seemingly out ofc control situation\nand that's what drives us into all the\ndopamine Loops you know the the social\nmedia the process food the porn the\ngambling the alcohol all of it it's all\nto amate I think ultimately fear and I\nthink yeah I think by actually really\njust spending a lot more time try and\nget that 93.7% down to like 50% spend as\nmuch time as you can outside we know\nthat people who spend more time outside\nare metabolically healthier and I think\nit's for pleotropic reasons but I think\none of it is that it is the\nultimate convincing of abundance and\nfundamental abundance in our world and\nof awe which I think is really the\nantidote to\nfear and that has a profoundly soothing\neffect on our psychology um and the\nsense of scarcity that drives a lot of\nthe decisions that actually make us\nunhealthy it's fundamentally rooted in\nin scarcity and I think also when we\nrealize we are part of nature again\ngoing back to that doubt statement we're\na process not an entity realizing like\nyou know all the trees around us and we\ntake that walk even in a city we see all\nthe trees all those plants all those\nleaves are making the oxygen that\nprocess that that literally let us do\noxid of phosphorilation and that sun and\nthat leaf on the tree the sun's energy\nis literally being stored in the carbon\ncarbon bonds that the plants are\ngenerating in photosynthesis that\nultimately all metabolism is is\nunlocking the potential energy stored\nfrom the sun to create the human energy\nthat lets us love and move and live and\nthink and do all the things we love to\ndo and then it just becomes so obvious\nlike of course we have to like eat real\nfood and of course we have to not poison\nour soil with pesticides and of course\nwe have to like you know care about the\nenvironment and we have to get outside\nand move and we have to be in the\nsunlight during the day because we are\nthe environment we are a process that's\nconstantly in Dynamic conversation with\nit and um\nI think I think a lot of people will\nfind that their health gets a lot better\nif they spend radically more time\noutdoors and I think a lot of people\nmight say well I can't I work on a\ncomputer and I'm like you know Rome is\nburning like we're sick as hell right\nnow we need to get creative like move\nyour computer outside take a walking\nmeeting open your mail Outdoors chop\nyour vegetables on your balcony at your\napartment like we we have to find a way\nto connect back with our source\nunderstand that the world is abundant\nand\nharmonious uh\nre-enchanting from that sense of\ngratitude and awe and that will lead us\nright where we need to go which is um a\nreally I think joyful experience of our\nhealth Journey um that's rooted\nfundamentally in connection rather than\nus being siloed from all of this which\ngoing back to the beginning of the\nconversation that's fundamentally what's\nwrong with the Healthcare System it's\nsilos and we have siloed oursel from all\nof the life-giving things in our\nenvironment and that has ultimately\nleted us to be very very very sick and\nwe've just I think we got to go back\noutside so that's one of the things but\nthere there's many other things we can\ndo to change those our relationship with\nfear but um we can't change the world as\na whole but we can change what happens\ninside our body in terms of how we\nrespond to it and for our mitochondria\nwe have to we have to create a sense of\nsafety in our bodies for our\nmitochondria to do the work we need them\nto do for health I love it and I love it\nfor many reasons I I think um it was my\nI know it was my friend and former guest\non this podcast Rick Rubin who several\ntimes early in our friendship he said um\nBack To Nature the only truth um and I\nasked him what he meant by that and you\nknow cuz Rick can be a little bit um\ncryptic sometimes um not always but\nsometimes and what he was saying is you\nknow it's a real thing you know you can\nimmediately feel the connectedness\nbetween The Human Experience and um life\nof other types plants animals you know\nsunlight the circadian rhythms and the\nand the rhythms of the of light and dark\num because they impact us so powerfully\nI mean if if there were ever a force in\nthe world that impacts how we feel it's\nthe Circadian rhythm it's the rising and\nsetting of the sun it's um the impact of\nlight and dark and then all the other\nthings that you talked about today um I\ncan't help but reflect on kind of your\ntake on kind of what a lot of not all\nbut a lot of U modern society attempts\nto do um it attempts to do a lot of good\nthings too I believe I'm a Believer in\ntechnology um but that it if I were to\ntranslate it sounded like um what you\nwere saying is that it gives us a sense\nof loss of control by instilling fear\nlike we don't have control and then um\nthere are a number of let's just call\nthem programs in the world um that then\nsell back the illusion of some sense of\nagency little by little right a\ntemporary agency and then puts you back\ninto the cycle and there's something\nabout going into nature which just um\nremoves one from all of that at least\ntemporarily gives you a more basic\nunderstanding of the relationship to\nself and things around us even just\nlooking being able to see it to a\ndistance we know is powerful for the the\nbrain reducing anxiety we know being\noutdoors for 2 hours or more per day\nreduces myopia nearsightedness this is\nindependent of all the other effects of\nof uh circadian rhythms Etc anyway and\non and on so I second and third and um\nand uh here here all the um all the\nstatements you made before I also just\nhave to say I I really appreciate how\nyou are able to tackle the cellular\nbiology the molecular biology the\nmacroscopic things that we can all do\nwalking resistance training um cold\nexposure sleep um high-intensity\ninterval training um and make make a\ncase for each and all of those as it\nrelates to the underlying biochemistry\nand weave all that together in a way\nthat then uh you beautifully wrapped\ninto this idea of connecting to Nature\nand not divorcing ourselves from Modern\nLife but really looking at the ways in\nwhich certain components of Modern Life\nare really making us sick not just the\nthe behaviors not just the dos and the\ndon'ts that it's kind of imparting on us\nbut also so kind of the psychology\naround it it's uh that it is quietly but\npowerfully oppressive is is the message\nthat I'm getting and that we have to\ntake a stand against it and the way to\ntake a stand against it is to do what\nare very um basic and fairly easy to\naccess things making better choices\nabout food timing quality amount\nexercise and on and on so so I'm running\nlong in my response to your much more\neloquent description of mindset uh but\nwhat I want to say is on behalf of\nmyself and everyone listening I so\nappreciate we appreciate the work that\nyou're doing to be a medical doctor\nspecialized in one of these silos and\nthen to take a step out and say nope not\nme I'm going to do what I see as best\nfor the greater good in terms of giving\npeople tools giving people a sense of\nagency and autonomy to take control of\ntheir health this is in some ways a\nheretical idea um but\nluckily the numbers of folks like you\nare growing and you're a real leader in\nthis field um by example and by the\nincredible work you're doing with\ntechnology and information sharing love\nlove love the book I did go through it\num front to back um I haven't tried the\nrecipes yet but thank you for bringing\nthe blueberries I'll try the recipes um\nat least one of them and um I just want\nto thank you for sharing what you do and\num for continuing to do what you do we\nwe need it and we appreciate it so thank\nyou thank you thank you
