    "video_title": "Dr. David Sinclair: The Biology of Slowing & Reversing Aging",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, my guest is Dr. David Sinclair,\nprofessor of genetics at\nHarvard Medical School\nand co-director of the\nPaul F. Glenn Center\nfor the Biology of Aging.\nDr. Sinclair's work is\nfocused on why we age\nand how to slow or reverse\nthe effects of aging\nby focusing on the cellular\nand molecular pathways\nthat exist in all cells of\nthe body and that progress\nthose cells over time from\nyoung cells to old cells.\nBy elucidating the biology of\ncellular maturation and aging,\nDr. Sinclair's group has\nfigured out intervention points\nby which any of us indeed, all of us,\ncan slow or reverse the effects of aging.\nWhat is unique about his work\nis that it focuses on\nbehavioral interventions,\nnutritional interventions,\nas well as supplementation\nand prescription drug\ninterventions that can help us all\nage more slowly and reverse\nthe effects of aging\nin all tissues of the body.\nDr. Sinclair holds a unique\nand revolutionary view\nof the aging process, which is that aging\nis not the normal and natural consequence\nthat we all will suffer.\nBut rather that aging is a disease\nthat can be slowed or halted.\nDr. Sinclair continually publishes\noriginal research articles\nin the most prestigious\nand competitive scientific journals.\nIn addition to that, he's\npublished a popular book\nthat was a New York Times bestseller.\nThe title of that book, is 'Lifespan:\nWhy We Age And Why We Don't Have To.'\nHe is also very active\nin public facing efforts\nto educate people on the biology of aging\nand slowing the aging process.\nDr. Sinclair, and I\nshare a mutual interest\nand excitement in public\neducation about science.\nAnd so I'm thrilled to share\nwith you that we've partnered.\nAnd Dr. David Sinclair\nis going to be launching\nthe lifespan podcast,\nwhich is all about the\nbiology of aging and tools\nto intervene in the aging process.\nThat podcast will launch\nWednesday, January 5th.\nYou can find it at the\nlink in the show notes\nto this episode today as well.\nYou can subscribe to that\npodcast on YouTube, Apple,\nor Spotify, or anywhere\nthat you get your podcasts.\nAgain, the lifespan podcast\nfeaturing Dr. David Sinclair,\nClaire begins Wednesday,\nJanuary 5th, 2022,\nbe sure to check it out.\nYou're going to learn a\ntremendous amount of information,\nand you're going to learn\nboth the mechanistic science\nbehind aging, the\nmechanistic science behind\nreversing the aging\nprocess and practical tools\nthat you can apply in your everyday life.\nIn today's episode, Dr. Sinclair\nand I talk about the biology of aging\nand tools to intervene in that process.\nAnd so you might view today's episode\nas a primer for the lifespan podcast,\nbecause we delve deep\ninto the behavioral tools,\nnutritional aspects,\nsupplementation aspects\nof the biology of aging.\nWe also talk about David's\nimportant discoveries\nof the sirtuins, particular components\nthat influence what is\ncalled the epigenome.\nAnd if you don't know\nwhat the epigenome is,\nyou will soon learn in today's episode.\nComing away from today's episode,\nyou will have in-depth knowledge\nabout the biology of aging\nat the cellular, molecular,\nand what we call the circuit level,\nmeaning how the different\norgans and tissues of the bodies\nage independently, and how they influence\nthe aging of each other.\nToday's episode gets into discussion\nabout many aspects of aging\nand tools to combat aging\nthat have not been discussed\non any other podcasts\nor in the book lifespan.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that the visual system\nhas to contend with a number\nof different challenges,\nsuch as when you move\nfrom a bright area outside\nto an area where there are shadows,\nyou have to adjust a number of\nthings in your visual system\nso that you can still see things clearly.\nOne problem with a lot of\neyeglasses and sunglasses\nis they don't take that\nbiological feature into account.\nAnd you have to take off your\nglasses and put them back on,\ndepending on how bright or\ndim a given environment is.\nWith ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou always see things\nwith the utmost clarity.\nIn addition, they're very lightweight\nand they won't slip off your face.\nIn fact, they were designed to be worn\nwhile biking or running\nand the various activities,\nbut they also have a terrific aesthetic,\nso you could wear them to dinner or work.\nI wear readers at night and when I drive\nand I wear the sunglasses\nfor most of the day.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nsunglasses or eyeglasses,\nyou can go to roka.com, that's roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman,\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's ROKA, roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nat checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get a clear picture\nof what your biological age is\nand compare that to\nyour chronological age.\nAnd obviously your biological\nage is the important one\nbecause it predicts how long you will live\nand it's the one that you can control.\nThe great thing about InsideTracker\nis that compared to a\nlot of other DNA tests\nand blood tests out there\nis that with InsideTracker,\nyou don't just get your numbers back\nat the levels of various\nhormones, metabolic factors,\nblood lipids, et cetera,\nbut it also offers clear\ndirectives to lifestyle factors,\nnutritional factors and\nsupplementation that you can use\nin order to get the\nnumbers into the ranges\nthat are best for you and for your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at

grain-free,\nketo friendly cereal.\nNow I don't follow a\nstrictly ketogenic diet.\nWhat works best for me is to eat according\nto my desire to be alert\nat certain times of day\nand to be sleepy at other times of day.\nSo for me, that means\nfasting until about 11:00 AM\nor 12 noon most days.\nAnd then my lunch is typically\na low carb, ketoish lunch,\nmaybe a small piece of grass-fed meat,\nsome salad, something of that sort.\nAnd then in the afternoon,\nI might have a snack\nthat's also ketoish.\nAnd then at night is when\nI eat my carbohydrates,\nwhich for me helps me with\nthe transition to sleep\nand allows me to get great deep sleep.\nThat's what works for me.\nWhat that means is in the\nafternoon I'm craving a snack.\nAnd the snack for me is Magic Spoon.\nWhat I do lately is I put\nin some Bulgarian yogurt.\nSometimes I just eat it straight.\nEach serving of Magic Spoon\nhas zero grams of sugar,\n13 to 14 grams of protein\nand only four grams of\ncarbohydrates in each serving.\nSo it really matches that\nlow carb ketoish approach.\nThere's only 140 calories per serving,\nand they have a variety of flavors.\nCoco, fruity, peanut butter or frosted.\nI particularly like frosted\n'cause it tastes like donuts.\nI try not to eat donuts,\nbut I do love the frost.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nI lately mix it with yogurt\npolo cinnamon on there.\nI'm getting hungry just talking about it.\nNow, if you want to try Magic Spoon,\nyou can go to magicspoon.com/huberman\nto grab a variety pack.\nUse the promo code Huberman at checkout,\nto get $5 off your order.\nAgain, that's magicspoon.com/huberman\nand use the code Huberman to get $5 off.\nAnd now my conversation\nwith Dr. David Sinclair.\nThank you for coming.\n- Thanks for having me here.\nIt's good to see you.\n- This is mate by the way, that\nwe're toasting at 11:00 AM.\nUnlike other podcasts, we,\nwell, I don't drink alcohol,\nso I'm boring that way.\nBut truly, thanks for being here,\nI have a ton of questions for you.\nWe go way back in some sense,\nbut that doesn't mean that I don't have\nmany, many questions about\naging, longevity, lifespan,\nactionable protocols to increase\nhow long we live, et cetera.\nAnd I just want to start off\nwith a very simple question.\nI'm not even sure there's an answer to,\nbut what is the difference\nbetween longevity,\nanti-aging and aging as a disease?\nBecause I associate\nyou with the statement,\naging is a disease.\n- Right?\nWell, so longevity is\nthe more academic way\nwe describe what we research.\nAnti-aging is kind of the same thing,\nbut it's got a bad rap\nbecause it's been used\nby a whole bunch of people that don't know\nwhat they're talking about.\nSo I really don't like\nthat term anti-aging,\nbut aging is a disease and longevity\nare perfectly valid ways\nto talk about this subject.\nSo let's talk about aging as a disease.\nWhen I started my research,\ndisease here at Harvard Medical School,\nit was considered,\nif there's something\nthat's wrong with you.\nand it's a rare thing,\nit has to be less than\n50% of the population,\nthat's definitely a disease,\nand then people work their whole lives\nto try and cure that condition.\nAnd so I looked up,\nwhat's the definition of aging\nand it says, well, it's\na deterioration in health\nand sickness and you can die\nfrom it, typically you do.\nSomething that sounds\npretty much like a disease,\nbut the caveat is that if\nmore than half the population\ngets this condition, aging,\nit's put in a different bucket.\nWhich is first of all, that's outrageous,\n'cause it's just a\ntotally arbitrary cutoff.\nBut think about this,\nthat we're ignoring the major\n'cause of all these diseases.\nAging is 80 to 90% the cause\nof heart disease, Alzheimer's.\nIf we didn't get old and\nour bodies stayed youthful,\nwe would not get those diseases.\nAnd actually what we're\nshowing in my lab is,\nif you turn the clock back, in tissues,\nthose diseases go away.\nSo aging is the problem\nand instead through,\nmost of the last 200 years,\nwe've been sticking band-aids on diseases\nthat have already\noccurred because of aging\nand then it's too late.\nSo there are a couple of things.\nOne is we want to slow aging down\nso we don't get those diseases\nand when they do occur,\ndon't just take a bandaid on,\nreverse the age of the body\nand then the diseases will go away.\n- That clarifies a lot for me, thank you.\nCan we point to one specific\ngeneral phenomenon in the body\nthat underlies aging?\n- Yeah, well, that's contentious\nbecause scientists like to\ncome up with new hypothesis.\nIt's how they build their careers.\nBut fortunately during the two thousands,\nwe settled on eight or\nnine major causes of aging.\nWe call them hallmarks\n'cause causes was a little bit too strong,\nbut these eight or nine causes,\nat least for the first time\nallowed us to come around\nand talk together.\nAnd we put them on a pizza\nso everyone got an equal\nweighting, equal slices.\nBut before that, by the way,\nwe were trying to kill\neach other in the field,\nthat was horrible.\n- Interesting that you guys work on aging\nand you're trying to kill each other.\n- Yeah, isn't it?\nWell kill each other's careers.\nWell I like to think\nI was fairly generous,\nbut I was one of the kids\nand the old guard really\ndidn't like the new guard.\nWe just came along in the 1990s\nand said, free radicals don't do much.\nThey're actually genes\ncalled longevity genes.\nAnd that caused a whole ruckus.\nAnd there was this competition\nfor what never happened,\nwhich was a Nobel prize for this.\nAnd it just led to a lot of competition.\nI would go to meetings and\npeople would shout at each other\nand backstab, it was horrible.\nBut then unfortunately\nin the two thousands,\nwe rallied around this new map of aging\nwith these causes of hallmarks.\nBut I think that there's\none slice of the pizza\nthat is way larger than the others.\nAnd we can get to that,\nbut that's the information in the cell\nthat we call the epigenome.\n- Well tell us a little bit\nmore about the epigenome,\nframe it for us if you will,\nand then we'll get into ways\nthat one can adjust the\nepigenome in positive ways.\n- Yeah, so in science, what I like to do,\na reductionist is to boil it down\nand I actually ended up boiling,\naging down to an equation,\nwhich is the loss of\ninformation due to entropy.\nIt's a hard thing to overcome,\nsecond law of thermodynamics.\nThat's fair, but this\nequation really represents\nthe fact that I think aging\nis a loss of information\nin the same way that\nwhen you xerox something,\na thousand times you'll\nlose that information\nor you try to copy a cassette tape.\nOr even if you send information\nacross the internet,\nsome of it will get lost.\nThat's what I think is aging.\nAnd there were two types\nof information in the body.\nThere is the genetic\ninformation, which is digital.\nATCG the chemical letters of DNA,\nbut there's this other part of\nthe information in the body.\nthat's just as important,\nit's essential, in fact,\nand that's the systems\nthat control which genes\nare switched on and off\nin what cell at what time\nin response to what we eat, et cetera.\nAnd it turns out that 80% of\nour future longevity and health\nis controlled by the second part,\nthe epigenetic information,\nthe control systems.\nI liken the DNA to the\nmusic that's on a DVD\nor a compact disc for the younger people.\nWe used to use these things.\n- I recall.\n- Yeah, and then the epigenome\nis the reader that says,\nokay, in this cell we need\nto play that set of songs\nand in this other cell,\nwe have to play a different set of songs.\nBut over time, aging is the\nequivalent of scratching,\nthe CD and the DVD so that you,\nyou're not playing the\nright songs and cells\nwhen they don't hear the right songs,\nthey get messed up and\nthey don't function well.\nAnd that is what I'm saying\nis the main driver of aging.\nAnd these other hallmarks\nare largely manifestations\nof that process.\n- Can we go a little deeper\ninto what that these scratches are.\nIs it the way that the DNA\nare packed into a cell?\nIs it the way that they're spaced?\nWhat are the scratches\nthat you're referring to?\n- So DNA is six foot long.\nSo if you join your chromosomes together,\nyou get a six foot post-sale.\nSo there's enough to go to\nthe moon and back eight times\nin your body.\nAnd it has to be wrapped\nup to exist inside us,\nbut it's not just wrapped up willy-nilly.\nIt's not just a bundle of string,\nit's wrapped up very carefully in ways\nthat dictates which genes\nare switched on and off.\nAnd when we're developing in the embryo,\nthe cell marks the DNA\nwith chemicals that says,\nokay, this gene is for a nerve cell.\nYour cell will stay a nerve cell\nfor the next a hundred\nyears, if you're lucky.\nDon't turn into a skin\ncell that would be bad.\nAnd those chemicals,\nthere are many different\ntypes of chemicals,\nbut one's called methylation.\nThose little menthols will\nmark which songs get played\nfor the rest of your life.\nAnd there are other that change daily.\nBut in total, what we're\nsaying is that the body\ncontrols the genome through\nthe ability to mark the DNA\nand then compact some parts\nof it, silence those genes,\ndon't read those genes and\nopen others, keep others open\nthat should stay open.\nAnd that pattern of genes\nthat are silent and open,\nsilent, open, is what\ndictates the cells type\nthe cells function.\nAnd then the scratches are\nthe disruption of that.\nSo genes that were once\nsilent and you could say,\nit's a gene that is involved in skin.\nIt's starting to come on in\nthe brain, shouldn't be there,\nbut we see this happen and vice versa,\nthe gene might get shut\noff over time during aging.\nCells over time, lose these structures,\nlose their identity,\nthey forget what they're supposed to do\nand we get diseases.\nWe call that aging and\nwe can measure that.\nIn fact, we can measure it in such a way\nthat we can predict when\nsomebody is going to die\nbased on the changes in those chemicals.\n- Are these changes, the\nsame sorts of changes\nthat underlie the outward\nbody surface manifestations\nof aging, that most of\nus are familiar with,\ngraying of the hair,\nwrinkling of the skin,\ndrooping of the face.\nWalking around New York lately,\nit's amazing to me,\nthere are certain people\nthat seem to walk looking\ndown at the sidewalk\nbecause their spine is\nessentially in a C shape, right?\nA hallmark, if you will, of aging,\nthat most of us are familiar with.\nAre the same sorts of DNA\nscratches associated with that?\nOr are we talking about people\nthat are potentially\nare going to look older,\nbut simply live longer?\n- Well, it's actually, you\nare as old as you look,\nif you want to generalize.\nSo let's start with centenarian families.\nThese are families that\ntend to live over a hundred.\nWhen they're 70, they\nstill look 50 or less.\nSo it is a good indicator.\nIt's not perfect\nbecause you can like me\ngrowing up in Australia\nand accelerate the aging of your skin.\nBut in general, how you look,\nand no one's ever died from gray hair,\nbut overall you can get a sense\njust from the ability of\nskin to hold itself up,\nhow thin it is, the number of wrinkles.\nA great paper just came out that said\nthat an AI System looking at the face\ncould very accurately\npredict someone's age.\n- Very interesting.\nSo I started off in\ndevelopmental neurobiology.\nSo one of the things\nthat I learned early on\nthat I still believe wholeheartedly\nis that development doesn't\nstop at age 12 or 15 or even 25\nthat your entire life is\none long developmental arc.\nSo in thinking about different portions\nof that developmental arc,\nthe early portion of infancy,\nand especially puberty, seem\nlike especially rapid stages\nof aging.\nAnd I know we normally\nlook at babies and children\nand kids in puberty, and we\nthink, oh, they're so vital,\nthey're so young.\nAnd yet the way you describe\nthese changes in the epigenome\nand the way you have\nframed aging as a disease\nleads me to ask are periods\nof immense vitality,\nthe same periods when we're aging faster.\n- Yes, yes.\nAnd this is something\nI've never talked about,\nat least not publicly.\nSo this is a really good question.\nSo those chemicals we can measure,\nit's also known as the Horvath's clock.\nIt's the biological clock,\nit's separate from your chronological age.\nSo actually what I didn't mention\nis that when the AI looked\nat the faces of those people,\nthey could predict their\nbiological age, their internal age.\nSo your skin represents the\nage of your organs as well.\nAnd the people that look after themselves,\nwe can talk about how to do that later.\nBut there are some people\nthat are 10, 20 years younger\nthan other people biologically\nand it turns out if you\nmeasure that clock from birth\nor even before birth,\nif you look at animals,\nthere's a massive increase\nin age, based on that clock,\nearly in life.\nSo you're right, so that's\na really important point,\nthat you have accelerated aging\nduring the first few years of life,\nand then it goes linear\ntowards the rest of your life.\nBut there's another interesting\nthing that you brought up,\nwhich is that we're finding that the genes\nthat get messed up, that get scratched\nthat are leading to aging\nare those early developmental genes.\nThey come on late in life\nand just mess up the system\nand they seem to be\nparticularly susceptible\nto those scratches.\nSo what's causing the scratches?\nWell, we know of a couple\nof things in my lab,\nwe figured out.\nOne is broken chromosomes, DNA damage,\nparticularly cuts to the DNA breaks.\nSo if you have an x-ray or a cosmic ray,\nor even if you go out in the sun\nand you'll get your broken chromosomes\nthat accelerates the unwinding\nof those beautiful DNA loops\nthat I mentioned.\nWe can actually do this to a mouse.\nWe can accelerate that process\nand we get an old mouse,\n50% older, and it has\nthis bent spine kyphosis.\nit has gray hair, it's organs are old.\nSo we now can control aging,\nthe forwards direction.\nThe other thing that accelerates aging\nis massive cell damage or stress.\nSo we pinched nerves and we\nsaw that their aging process\nwas accelerated as well.\n- Incredible, this is more\nof an anecdotal phenomenon.\nIt is an anecdotal phenomenon,\nbut at this experience\nof in junior high school,\ngoing home for a summer and you come back\nand then high school in the US\nusually starts eighth or ninth grade,\nor grade eight or grade\nnine for you Canadians.\nAnd then some of the kids,\nlike they grew beards over the summer,\nor they completely matured\nquickly over the summer.\nDo you think there's any reason to believe\nthat rates of entry\ninto and through puberty\ncan predict overall rates of aging?\nIn other words, if a kid\nis a slow burner, right?\nThey basically acquire\nthe traits of puberty\nslowly over many years.\nCan we make some course prediction\nthat they are going to live a long time\nversus a kid that goes home for the summer\nand comes back a completely\ndifferent organism\nor appearing to be a\ncompletely different organism.\nLike they basically age\nvery quickly in the summer.\nDoes that mean they're\naging very quickly overall?\n- Well, yeah, I don't\nwant to scare anybody.\n- Sure.\n- That there are studies that show\nthat the slower you take to\ndevelop it also is predictive\nof having a longer, healthier life.\nAnd it may have something\nto do with growth hormone.\nWe know that growth hormone is pro-aging.\nAnyone who's taking growth\nhormone, pay attention.\n- Just look at someone\nwho's taking growth hormone.\n- Yeah.\n- They often will acquire these\ncharacteristics of vitality,\nlike improved a smoothness of skin,\nbut their whole body shape changes often.\n- Yeah, I mean you'll feel better\nfor a short amount of time.\nYou'll build up muscle, you feel great,\nbut it's like burning\nyour candle at both ends.\nUltimately, if you want to live longer,\nyou want less of that.\nAnd the animals that have been generated\nand mutants that have low growth hormone,\nor sometimes these are dwarfs,\nthey live the longest by far.\nA guy in my lab, Michael Bankowski,\nhe had the longest lived mouse,\na mouse typically lives\nabout two and a bit years.\nHe had a mouse that lived five years\nand he gave it chloric\nrestriction, so fasting,\ncombined with one of\nthese dwarf mutations,\nlow growth hormone, I\nthink he called it Yoda.\nYou look at who lives the longest,\nit's the really small people.\nThis is a bit anecdotal,\nbut it sounds like it might be true,\nis that the people who\nplayed the munchkins\nin the Wizard of Oz, many\nof them went on to live\ninto their nineties and beyond.\n- Really?\n- Yeah.\n- Huh, amazing.\n- And are there are some\nLauren dwarfs as well?\nThere are dwarf mutations in South America\nand they seem to be protected\nagainst many of the diseases of aging.\nYou barely ever see heart disease\nor cancer in these families.\n- So I having owned a\nvery large dog breed,\na bulldog Mastiff who lived\na long life for a bulldog,\n11 years, but there are\nmany dogs that will live\n12, 16 years that are smaller dogs.\nCan we say that there's\na direct relationship\nbetween body size and\nlongevity or duration of life?\n- Well, there is, but that\ndoesn't mean that you're a slave\nto your early epigenome\nnor have to your genome.\nThe good news is that\nthe epigenome can change.\nThose loops and structures can be modified\nby how you live your life.\nAnd so if you're born tall and I wasn't,\nand I wished at the time I did grow,\nbut no matter what size you are,\nyou can have a bigger impact on your life\nthan anything your genes give you.\n80% is epigenetic not genetic.\n- So let's talk about some of\nthe things that people can do.\nAnd I've kind of batch\nthese into categories\nrather than just diving right\ninto actionable protocols.\nSo the first one relates to\nfood, blood sugar, insulin.\nThis is something I hear a lot about,\nthat fasting is good for us,\nbut rarely do I hear why it's good for us.\nOne of the reasons I'm\nexcited to talk to you today\nis because I want to drill\ninto the details of this\nbecause I think\nunderstanding the mechanism\nwill allow people to make better choices\nand not simply to just\ndecide whether or not\nthey're going to fast or not fast,\nor how long they're going to fast,\nI think should be dictated\nby someone understanding\nof the mechanism.\nSo why is it that having\nelevated blood sugar,\nglucose and insulin ages us more quickly\nand or why is it that having\nperiods of time each day\nor perhaps longer can extend our lifespan?\n- Well, let's start with what\nI think was a big mistake\nwas the idea that people\nshould never be hungry.\nWe live in a world now\nwhere there's at least three meals a day,\nand then we've got companies\nselling bars and snacks\nin between.\nSo the feeling of hunger,\nsome people never experienced\nhunger in their whole lives.\nIt's really, really bad for them.\nIt was based, I believe\non the 20th century view\nthat you don't want to\nstress out the pancreas\nand you try to keep insulin\nlevels pretty steady\nand not have this fluctuation.\nWhat we actually found,\nmy colleagues and I,\nacross this field of longevity\nis that when you look\nat first of all animals,\nwhether it's a dog or a mouse or a monkey,\nthe ones that live the\nlongest by far 30% longer\nand stay healthy are the ones\nthat don't eat all the time\nactually was first discovered back\nin the early 20th century,\nbut people ignored it.\nAnd then it was rediscovered in the 1930s,\nClaude McKay did Clark restriction.\nHe put cellulose in the food of rats,\nso they couldn't get as many\ncalories even though they ate.\nAnd those rats lived 30% longer,\nbut then it went away\nand then it came back\nin the 2000's in a big way,\nwhen a couple of things happened,\none is that my lab and others showed\nthat there were longevity\ngenes in the body\nthat come on and protect\nus from aging and disease.\nThe group of genes that I\nwork on are called sirtuins\nthere's seven of them.\nAnd we show it in 2005 in a science paper,\nthat if you have low levels of insulin\nand another molecule called\ninsulin like growth factor,\nthose low levels turn\non the longevity genes.\nOne of them that's really\nimportant is called SIRT1.\nBut by having high levels\nof insulin all day,\nbeing fed, means your longevity\ngenes are not switched on.\nSo you're falling apart, your\nepigenome, your information,\nthat keeps your cells\nfunctioning over time,\njust degrades quick.\nYour clock is ticking\nfaster by always being fed.\nOkay.\nThe other thing that I\nthink might be happening\nby always having food around\nis that it's not allowing the\ncell to have periods of rest\nand re-establish the epigenome.\nAnd so it also is accelerating\nin that direction.\nThere's plenty of other reasons as well,\nthat are not as profound,\nsuch as having low levels\nof glucose in your body\nwill trigger your major\nmuscles in your brain\nto become more sensitive to insulin\nand suck the glucose\nout of your bloodstream,\nwhich is very good.\nYou don't want to have glucose\nflowing around too much,\nand that will ward off type two diabetes.\n- So hunger of course is\nassociated with low blood glucose\nand low insulin.\nDo you think there's anything\nabout the subjective\nexperience of hunger itself\nthat could be beneficial for longevity?\n- Yeah, I do,\nthough you get used to\nthe feeling of not eating,\nso I'm kind of screwed that way.\n- It's like cold water,\nyou eventually adapt.\n- You get used to it, unfortunately,\nbut there are some studies\nthat are being done\nat the National Institutes of Health\nthat are able to simulate\nthe effect of hunger,\nbut still provide the calories.\nAnd it's looking like\nthere's a small component\nthat's due to hunger, but most of it,\nactually, is because\nyou've got these periods\nof not being fed and then the body\nturns on these defensive genes.\nThere's a really interesting experiment\nthat was published maybe\na couple of years ago\nby Rafael de Cabo down at the NIH.\nWhat he did was he took over 10,000 mice\nand gave them different combinations\nof fat, carbohydrate, protein.\nAnd he was trying to figure out\nwhat was the best combination.\nAnd then you also cleverly had a group.\nWell, two groups, one\nthat was fed all the time\nor ate as much as they wanted\nand the other group was only\ngiven food for an hour a day.\nAnd it turns out they ate\nroughly the same amount of calories,\n'cause of course in an hour\nthey're stuffing their faces.\nIt turns out it didn't matter\nwhat diet he gave them,\nit was only the group that\nate within that window\nthat lived longer and dramatically longer.\nSo my conclusion is,\nand mice are very similar\nto us, metabolically,\nI think that tells us that\nit's not as important,\nwhat you eat, it's when\nyou eat during the day.\n- What is the protocol\nthat people can extrapolate from that?\nOr maybe I should just ask you,\nwhat is your protocol for when to eat\nand when to avoid food?\nDo you fast, do you ever\nfast, longer than 24 hours?\nWhat do you do?\nAnd what do you think is\na good jumping off place\nif people want to explore\nthis as a protocol?\n- Well, if there's one thing I could say,\nI would say definitely\ntry to skip a meal a day,\nthat's the best thing.\n- Does it matter which meal\nor they're essentially equivalent?\n- Well, as long as it's at the end\nor the beginning of the day,\nbecause then you add\nthat to the sleep period\nwhere you're hopefully not eating.\n- I think that that's an excellent point.\nI realized it's a simple one,\nbut I think it's an excellent one\n'cause I think one of\nthe things that people\nstruggle with the most\nis knowing when and how\nto initiate this so-called\nintermittent and fasting.\nAnd the middle of the day\nobviously is not tacked\nto the sleep cycle in the same way.\nSo it's much harder as\nwell for many people.\n- Yeah, well, I'll tell you what I do.\nI skip breakfast, I have a\ntiny bit of yogurt or olive oil\nbecause the supplements I have\nneed to be dissolved in it.\nAnd then I go throughout the whole day,\nas I'm doing right now, here\nwith this glass of water here,\nI'm just keeping myself\nfilled with liquids.\nAnd so I don't feel hungry,\nbe aware that the first\ntwo to three weeks,\nwhen you try that you will feel hungry\nand you also have a habit of wanting\njust to chew on something\nthat there's a lot of\nphysical parts to it,\nbut try to make it through\nthe first three weeks\nand do without breakfast\nor do without dinner\nand you'll get through it.\nAnd I did that most for\nmost of my life, actually,\nmainly because I wasn't\nhungry in the morning.\nSome people are very hungry in the morning\nand they may want to consider\nskipping dinner instead,\nbut I will go throughout the whole day.\nI don't get the crashes\nof the high glucose\nand the low glucose that anyone who goes,\noh man, it's three O'clock,\nI'm going to need a sleep.\nIf you do what I do,\nyou will not experience that anymore\nbecause what my body does\nis it regulates blood\nsugar levels naturally.\nMy liver is putting out\nglucose when it needs to,\nand it's very steady\nand gives me pure focus\nthroughout the day.\nAnd I don't have to even\nhave to think about lunch,\nI'm just powering through.\nAt dinner, I mean, I love\nfood as much as anybody.\nSo I will eat a regular,\npretty healthy meal.\nI'll try to eat mostly\nvegetables, I can eat some fish,\nsome shrimp, I rarely will eat a steak.\nIn fact, my microbiome is\nso adapted to my diet now,\nif I eat a steak, it will\nnot get digested very well.\nI'll feel terrible.\n- If I don't eat a steak, I feel terrible.\n[David laughs]\n- Argentine lineage, but\nwe can talk about that\nsome other time.\n- Well, everybody's different,\nthat's the other thing.\nWhat works for me may\nnot be perfect for you\nand we do have to measure\nthings to know what's working.\nI rarely eat dessert, I\ngave up dessert and sugar\nwhen I turned 40 and occasionally\nI'll steal a bit of dessert\n'cause it doesn't hurt\nif you steal it, right.?\nBut other than that I avoid sugar,\nwhich includes simple carbohydrates,\nbread, I try to avoid,\nI've actually noticed,\nthis is just a side note.\nI used to get buildup\nof plaque pretty easily\nand every time I went to the dentist,\nthey'd have to scrape it off.\nAnd I even bought tools to scrape it off.\n'cause it was driving me nuts.\nI don't get pluck anymore\nand I think it's because of my diet.\nI don't have those sugars in my mouth\nthat the bacteria feed on\nand then form the biofilm on the teeth.\nMuch better breath, by the way.\n- That's a benefit.\nShould you ever fast longer than this.\nIt sounds if you go to bed,\nwell, you used to tend to stay up late.\nI know because I get texts from you\nat like two in the morning my time,\nwhich means you're out very\nlate and up early as well.\nBut assuming that people go to sleep\nsometime around 1130 or\n12, plus or minus an hour\nand wake up sometime around 7:00 AM\nplus or minus 90 minutes,\nyou're eating more or less on.\nIt sounds something like\na 20 hours of fasting,\nfour hours of eating\nor 16 hours of fasting\nand eight hours of food intake, et cetera.\nBut do you ever do longer fast,\nlike 48 hours or 72\nhours a week long, fast?\n- Occasionally I do.\nSo my typical day I would only\neat within a two hour window.\nJust usually I'm either eating out or.\n- 'Cause you're 22 too.\n- Yeah, but I love well.\n- And if you exercise,\ndo you feel like you,\nthen you just power through\nand maintain that fasted state?\n- Absolutely, I can exercise\nand now I've already so used to it.\nI don't feel like I need food\nafter exercising, I used to.\nBut have I gone longer?\nYes, but not very often.\nI find it quite difficult\nto go more than 24 hours.\nBut when I do it, maybe it's once a month,\nI'll go for two days after\ntwo and actually even better,\nif you go for three days without eating,\nit kicks in even greater\nlongevity benefits.\nSo there's a system called\nthe autophagy system,\nwhich digests old and\nmisfolded proteins in the body.\nAnd there's a natural cleansing\nthat happens when you're hungry.\nMacroautophagy its name is\nbut a good friend of mine,\nAna Maria Cuervo at Albert\nEinstein College of Medicine\ndiscovered a deep cleanse\ncalled the chaperone mediated autophagy,\nwhich kicks in day two, day three,\nwhich really gets rid\nof the deep proteins.\nAnd what excites me is you\njust put out a big paper\nthat said, if you trigger\nthis process in an old mouse,\nit lives 35% longer.\n- [Andrew] Wow.\n- Yeah, so it's a big deal.\nIf I could go longer, I would.\nBut I just find that with my lifestyle\nand I'm going always\nday, 110% I need to eat\nat least once a day unfortunately.\n- One more practical question\nthen a mechanistic question\nrelated to this, the practical question\nis when you are fasting,\nregardless of how long,\nI know you're ingesting fluids like water\nand presumably some caffeine\nI heard you had several\nor more espresso today,\nwhich is impressive,\nbut are you also ingesting electrolytes?\nLike I know some people get lightheaded,\nthey start to feel shaky when they fast.\nAnd that the addition\nof sodium to their water\nor potassium magnesium is something\nthat's becoming a little more invoke now.\nIs that something that you do\nor that you see a need for people to do?\n- Well, it makes sense, but I\nhaven't had a need to do it.\nSo I don't, I drink tea\nduring the day and coffee\nwhen I'm first awake and\nI don't get the shakes.\nSo I don't fix what's not broken.\nAnd I do add things to my protocol\nthat I think will improve\nme and avoid those things\nof course that wont.\nBut yeah, because I\ndon't have a need for it,\nI don't try it.\nBut it does make sense,\nespecially if you've had a\nbig night the night before,\nyou'd probably want to\nsupplement with that.\nBut I think there's fair\namount of good stuff\nin tea and coffee as it is.\n- Okay, so then the\nmechanistic question is,\nyou've told us that there's ample evidence\nthat keeping your blood sugar\nlow for a period of time\nis 24 hours, can help\ntrigger some of these pro\nlongevity anti-aging mechanisms.\nAnd that extending them\nout two or three days\ncan trigger yet additional\nmechanisms of gobbling up\nof dead cells and things of that sort.\nHow is it that blood glucose\ntriggers these mechanisms?\nBecause we've said, okay, remove glucose\nand things get better.\nYou've talked before maybe\nwe could talk more now\nabout some of the underlying\ncellar and genetic mechanisms,\nthings like this are sirtuins,\nbut how our glucose in the sirtuins\nactually tethered to one\nanother mechanistically.\n- There's a really good question,\nthat proves you're a scientist\nor a world-leading one.\nSo what we've now know is\nthat these longevity pathways,\nwe call them these longevity\ngenes, talk to each other.\nAnd we used to say,\noh, my longevity genes is\nmore important than yours.\nIt was ridiculous.\n'Cause they're all talking to each other,\nyou pull one lever and\nthe other one moves.\nAnd the way to think of it is\nthat there are systems set up\nto detect what you're eating.\nSo the sirtuins will mainly\nrespond to sugar and insulin.\nAnd then there's this\nother system called mTOR,\nwhich is sensing how much\nprotein or amino acids\nare coming into your body.\nAnd they talk to each other,\nwe can pull one and affect\nthe other and vice versa.\nBut together when you're fasting,\nyou'll get the sirtuin\nactivation, which is good for you.\nAnd you'll also through\nlack of amino acids,\nparticularly three of them,\nleucine, lysine and valine.\nThe body will down-regulate\nmTOR and it's that up sirtuin,\ndown MTOR that is hugely beneficial\nand turns on all of the body's defenses,\nthe pro chewing up the old proteins,\nimproving insulin sensitivity,\ngiving us more energy,\nrepairing cells, all of that.\nAnd so these two pathways, I think,\nare the most important for longevity.\n- So interesting, you mentioned leucine,\nwithin the resistance training\nslash body building slash\nfitness community.\nLeucine gets a lot of attention\nbecause there are long-standing debates\nabout how much protein one needs per day\nand how much you want and\ncan assimilate at each meal.\nIt makes for many YouTube videos\nand not much else, frankly.\nHowever, it's clear that\nbecause of leucine's effects\non the mTOR pathway, that\nthere are many people,\nnot just people in these\nparticular fitness communities\nthat are actively trying\nto ingest more leucine\non a regular basis in order\nto maximize their wellness\nand fitness and in some\ncases muscle growth\nbut also just wellness.\nBut what I interpret your\nlast statement to mean\nis that leucine, because\nit triggers seller growth\nis actually pro aging in\nsome sense, is that right?\n- Well, it could be that's\nwhat the evidence suggests.\nAnd again it goes back to the debate.\nShould you supplement with\ngrowth hormone or testosterone?\nAll of these activities will\ngive you immediate benefits.\nYou'll bulk up more.\nYou'll feel better immediately,\nbut based on the research,\nit's at the expense of long-term health.\nSo my view of longevity,\nthe way I treat my body is\nI don't burn both candles.\nI have one end of the candle lit,\nI'm very careful I don't blow on it,\nbut I also do enough exercise\nthat I'm building up my\nmuscle, but I'm not huge.\nAnyone who's seen me,\nknows that I'm not a\nprofessional bodybuilder,\nbut I tried to actually, here's the key.\nAnd I haven't said this\npublicly, that I can remember.\nI pulse things so that\nI get periods of fasting\nand then I eat, then I take a supplement,\nthen I fast, then I exercise\nand I'm taking the supplements\nand eating in the right timing\nto allow me to build up muscle sometimes\nbecause you can't just expect\nto take something constantly\nand do something\nconstantly for it to work.\nAnd that's why it's\ntaken me about 15 years\nto develop my protocol.\nAnd there's a lot of subtlety to it.\n- Yeah, it sounds like a\nvery rational protocol.\nDoes the name Ori Hofmekler\nmean anything to you?\n- No.\n- Okay, just briefly, I\ndiscovered Ori Hofmekler\nabout 15 years ago, he was\na in Israeli special forces.\nHe's now got to be close to 70.\nForgive me Ori, if that\nnumber is inflated.\nHe wrote a book called 'The Warrior Diet',\nwhich got very little\nattention at the time.\nBut what he said was when he\nwas in Israeli special forces,\nthey rarely ate more than once per day.\nAnd sometimes once every\nsecond or third day.\nAnd this is a guy who maintains\nincredible physical stature,\nhe's very lean, very strong\nand very vital at, I\nwouldn't say an advanced age,\nbut he's getting up there\nand he just seems to be\ngetting better and better.\nOri Hofmekler was the person\nwho essentially founded,\nif you will, although\nour ancestors founded,\nto be completely fair,\nthe so-called intermittent fasting diet.\nHe called it the warrior diet\nand this book didn't get much attention.\nBut one of the things that you just said\nreally reminded me of Ori.\nI sat down with him, I\nactually went to his home\nand sat down with him and he\nsaid, fasting is wonderful\nbut these pulses where\nyou nourish the body\nor even slightly over nourish the body\nprovided they aren't too frequent,\nhave a tremendous effect on vitality.\nAnd so I want to use\nthat as kind of a segue\nto address this issue of\nvitality versus longevity,\nbecause here you're telling me\nand certainly the evidence supports\nthat growth hormone will make\nyou feel better and younger\ntaking testosterone or estrogen,\nwe should probably say.\nThere are women who take\nhormone therapies later in life\nwho take estrogen,\nthey experience a strong\nincrease in vitality\nif it's done correctly, but\nthere is an effect of aging,\nthe body more rapidly,\nit's sort of a second puberty if you will,\nbut this idea of restriction\nand then pulsing,\nnot necessarily feast and famine,\nbut certainly famine and\nfeast in lowercase letters,\nthere really seems to\nbe something about that.\nSo at a cellular level,\nwe'd kind of go back to\nmTOR and the sirtuins.\nHow do you think that the\ncells might be reacting\nto this kind of lowercased\nfeast and upper case famine\ntype protocol?\n- Right, well, the pulsing, I\nthink is what you want to do\nis to get the cells to\nbe perceiving adversity.\nOkay, 'cause our modern\nlife we're sitting around,\nwe're eating too much,\nwe're not exercising.\nOur cells respond.\nThey go, hey, everything's\ncool, no problem.\nAnd they become relaxed and their own turn\non their defenses and we age rapidly.\nWe can see it in the clock.\nPeople who exercise and eat less,\nhave a slower ticking clock, it's a fact.\nBut my protocol is\ndifferent than most people's\nbecause I am pulsing it.\nNow, first of all, let's get to,\nwhy did I even think\nthat might be possible?\n'Cause I didn't read the warrior diet.\nWhat I found in my research was that\nif we gave resveratrol on\nthis red wine molecule,\nthat became well known in the 2000's.\nIf we gave it to mice,\ntheir whole lifespan,\nthey were protected\nagainst a high-fat diet,\nwhich we call the Western diet.\nThey had lean organs.\nThey live slightly longer, but not a lot.\nAnd if we gave them a high-fat\ndiet without resveratrol,\nthey actually lived a lot shorter.\nSo it resveratrol protected\nthem against the high-fat diet.\nWe gave it to them on a normal diet,\nthey just ate it when they wanted,\nand there wasn't much effect.\nThis is what's not known though\nit's in a supplemental data of the paper\nthat nobody ever reads.\nThe mice that were given\nresveratrol every second day\non a normal diet live dramatically longer\nthan any other group.\n- [Andrew] Interesting.\n- So people out there, my\ncritics say, resveratrol\ndidn't extend the lifespan\nof mice on a normal diet.\nTherefore it's not aging,\nit's just protecting\nagainst a high-fat diet.\nWell, look at the\nsupplemental data, please.\nIf you give it to the\nmice every other day,\nwe had mice living over three years.\n- Wow, that's a long time,\nI have got many, many mice\nin my owner ownership\nat my lab at Stanford\nand that's a very long life for a mouse.\n- It was, by far.\nAnd so it was a long life span extension.\nAnd what that told me is that probably,\nyou don't want to be taking\na supplement every day.\nYou can take it either every other day\nor give your body a rest.\nAnd I do the same with my meals,\nI rest during the day and then\nI give a nutritious dinner\nto my body and then give it\na rest, same with exercise.\nAnd then I try to time it\nbecause there are times\nwhen I'm taking the drug\nMetformin, which mimics low energy.\nFor those of you who don't know,\nMetformin is a drug given\nto type two diabetics\nto bring down their blood sugar levels.\nBut it's been found that\nlooking at tens of thousands\nof veterans and all those,\nthat those two type two diabetics\nlive longer than people\nthat don't even get type two diabetes.\nSo it's a longevity drug,\nright now you have to get it\nfrom your doctor in the US,\nin most of the countries\nyou can just get it\nover the counter and you protected.\nIt looks like, based on\nepidemiological data, cancer,\nheart disease for LT.\nWhat else?\nDementia.\nSo I take Metformin.\n- In addition,\nyou take Metformin end\nfast fasting each day.\nSo when do you take it\nrelative to the fasting?\n- Yeah, I always take\nMetformin in the morning,\nalong with the resveratrol,\nbecause for a number of reasons,\nbut mainly because my body responds better\nand I've been measuring\nmy body for 12, 13 years.\nBut here's the thing, if I'm\ngoing to exercise that day,\nI will skip the Metformin.\nAnd a lot of people who do pay attention\nto this kind of thing,\nthink that they should\nstop taking Metformin\n'cause they're never going to get muscle,\nor it's going to affect their\nability to build up muscle.\nBut that's not true, what\nMetformin does to you,\nit actually just reduces\nyour ability to have stamina\nbecause it's inhibiting your\nbody's ability to make energy.\nAnd so what happens is\nwhen you're on Metformin,\nyou do fewer reps.\nBut guess what?\nThose muscles that you\ndo build up on Metformin,\nhave the same strength and\nhave much lower inflammation\nand other markers of aging.\nYou just won't have that\nextra 5% size of muscles.\nSo if you want large muscles,\ndon't take Metformin and you'll be fine\nduring your exercise.\nBut for me, I'm not trying to get giant.\nI want strong muscles\nand I want to live longer\nand healthier.\nSo I just try to time it\nso that I get the most reps\nout of my exercise regime,\nbut sometimes in scientific literature,\nit's worth bringing this up.\nIf there's a 5% difference in a graph,\nthen either the press release\nor some reporter will say,\noh my goodness, big difference,\n5% contact Metformin during exercise.\nThat's the headline.\nAnd then you go in and\nit's barely significant.\nAnd the graph is distorted\nbecause they've changed\nthe axes to make it look bigger.\nAnd now it's become a myth\nthat Metformin greatly inhibits\nour ability to exercise,\nwhich is not true, but in\nan abundance of caution,\nI skipped my Metformin on\ndays I'm going exercise.\nAnd not only that,\nI'm one of the 20% of people\nthat has a stomach sensitivity to it.\nSo if I'm not feeling great that day,\nI don't take it either.\n- You mentioned Metformin is available\nonly by prescription from a\ndoctor, at least in the US.\nBerberine is a substance\nthat comes from Tree Barco.\nI also learned about\nmany years ago from Ori.\nHe said, if ever, I'm going to overeat\nlike a Thanksgiving meal or something,\nI take berberine, those were his words.\nAnd I tried it and what's\nremarkable about berberine\nis that you can eat\nenormous quantities of food\nand not feel as if you've eaten\nenormous quantities of food.\nI'm not necessarily\nrecommending people do this.\nBut what I noticed was\nif I took berberine,\nwhich my understanding is\nit works very similarly\nto Metformin where some\nof the AMPK pathway\nand the mTOR pathway, et cetera,\nthat if I didn't ingest food\nin particular carbohydrates,\nI would feel a little dizzy\nand kind of get a headache,\nlike almost hypoglycemic.\nWhat are your thoughts on berberine\nas an alternative to Metformin?\nAnd are there any cautionary notes?\nObviously people should\ntalk to their doctor\nbefore adding or subtracting\nanything from their life,\nincluding breath order,\nanything that comes up,\nbut with all of that set aside,\nwhat are your thoughts about berberine\nand timing of low blood sugar\nand these sorts of things?\n- Right, well, before I\nhad access to Metformin,\nI was taking berberine.\nIt's often known as the\npoor man's Metformin.\n- He just called me poor.\n- Women can take it too.\nSo the thing with berberine\nand we started it in my lab,\nit is effective at boosting\nenergetics in the body,\njust like AMPK and Metformin does.\nAnd we've actually given\nit to rats and mice\nand seen that they are very healthy,\nespecially on a high-fat diet.\nSo I think it's likely to be good.\nThere are some human studies that exist,\nclinical trials showing\nthat it increases insulin sensitivity.\nYou have to take high doses.\n- Which is a good thing, right?\nI think when people hear\ninsulin sensitivity,\nsometimes people think,\noh, well that's bad, right?\nNo, but you want your cells\nto be insulin sensitive.\nYou don't want a lot of\nblood sugar floating around\nthat can't be sequestered into cells.\n- Exactly, so this is\nanti type two diabetes.\nAnd so that this berberine\ndoes have wonderful effects\non the metabolism of animals\nand in some clinical trials\non dozens of people that's being tested.\nNow, there's one cautionary\ntale, which just came up,\nCaenorhabditis lab\npublished that berberine\nreduced the lifespan of worms,\nbut I'm not sure worms\ntrump human clinical trials\nat this point.\n- Not in my opinion,\nno disrespect to my C. elegans colleagues\nor rather my colleagues that work on C.\n- Yeah, well, what I like to do\nis to give all the information,\npeople can decide what they want,\nbut I would say based on the worm data,\nI wouldn't panic just yet.\nAnd I think berberine has been shown\nto be really safe in humans.\n- You mentioned resveratrol,\nthink now would be a great time\nto talk a little bit about,\nprotocols for resveratrol,\ngreat seed extract, et cetera.\nLet's start with the obvious\none that I know you get a lot,\nbut for the record, can't\nI just drink red wine\nand get enough resveratrol, David.\n- You can try, you need to\ndrink about 200 glasses a day.\n- I'm sure it's been tried.\n- There are some, and I drink\na glass of red wine a day\nif I get the chance,\nbut any more than that,\nit's a lot of calories and\nyour liver will get fatty\nand it's all bad.\nSo, I mean, realistically,\nyou can only get the thousand milligrams\nthat I take a day from a\nsupplement that's pure.\nNow there are a lot of\npeople selling resveratrol.\nIf it's not light gray or\nwhite in color, throw it away.\nThe brown stuff has gone\nbad or is contaminated.\nAnd the contaminated stuff\nbeware it'll cause diarrhea.\nBut regular resveratrol\nshould not do that.\n- So a thousand milligrams\nper day is what you do.\n- Yeah and I had for about 15 years now.\nAnd you ingest that with\nsome fatty substance,\nlike olive oil or yogurt, is that right?\n- Yeah, you have to, and other supplements\nof course it's in curcumin.\nThese are crunchy things,\nthat is not going to get through your gut.\nAnd I'm not just making this up.\nI always base my statements\non human studies.\nSo we've done a lot of\nstudies on resveratrol\nas have others since,\nand we know that from,\nwe found out early, I was\none of the first people\nto take a high dose for resveratrol.\nAnd when we included it with food,\nthe levels in my blood went up five fold.\nAnd so you want to have\nsomething in there.\nIf you just drink it with water,\nit's not going to get through.\nAnd unfortunately, some people\nhave done clinical trials\nwithout even thinking that they might need\nto dissolve it in something.\n- So are you taking this\nall at once in the morning\nand chasing it with some olive oil\nor are you dissolving it in yogurt?\nWhat's the specific protocol?\n- Yeah, I've been improving perfecting\nwhat I do for about 10 years\nI would take some Greek yogurt,\na couple of spoonfuls, put\nthe resveratrol on there,\nmix it around, make sure it's dissolved\nand put that in my mouth and swallow that,\nthese days, what I like to do,\nbecause I've realized that olive oil\nand particularly oleic acid,\none of the mono unsaturated,\nfatty acids is also an activator\nof the sirtuin defenses.\nSo I'm trying to ingest\nmore of oleic acid.\nSo I switched to olive oil.\nWhat I do is I put a couple\nof teaspoons of olive oil\nin a glass mix around the resveratrol,\nand maybe some Coresatin\na similar molecule.\nMake sure it's dissolved.\nI put a little bit of vinegar\nand if I have a basil\nleaf, I'll put that in.\nAnd it's like drinking\nsome salad dressing.\nAnd it's very-\n- Delicious, that raises a\nquestion that I want to ask\nbefore we get to NMN\nand NR and vitamin B3,\nwhich is by doing that,\ndo you think that it breaks your fast?\nAnd I want to just frame this\nquestion of breaking the fast\nin a more general scientific theme.\nAnd I'd love your thoughts on this.\nOne of the questions I\nget asked all the time\nis does ingesting blank break the fast,\ndoes eating this or drinking this, coffee?\nIf I walk in the room and\nsomeone else is eating a cracker,\ndoes it break my fast?\nPeople get pretty extreme with this,\nmy sense and please tell me if I'm wrong,\nbut my sense is that it\ndepends on the context\nof what you did the night before,\nwhether or not you're\ndiabetic, lots of things.\nSo for instance, if I eat an\nenormous meal at midnight,\ngo to sleep, wake up at 6:00 AM.\nI could imagine that black coffee\nor coffee with a little bit\nof cream might quote unquote,\nbreak my fast, but the body\ndoesn't have a breaking the fast switch.\nThe body only speaks in the\nlanguage of glucose, AMPK,\nmTOR, et cetera.\nSo do you worry that\ningesting these calories\nis going to quote unquote break your fast?\nAnd more generally,\nhow do you think about the\nissue of whether or not\nyou're fasting enough to\nget these positive effects?\nBecause not everybody can manage\non just water or just tea,\nor we should say not\neverybody is willing to manage\non just water or just tea for\na certain part of the day.\n- Well, my first answer is not scientific,\nit's philosophical.\nIf you don't enjoy life, what's the point.\nAnd so I'd like a cup of\ncoffee in the morning,\na little bit of milk, spoonful of yogurt,\nit's not going to kill me.\nOlive oil doesn't have protein\nor carbs in it, not many.\nAnd so I'm probably not affecting\nthose longevity pathways\nnegatively, but without that,\nfirst of all, I wouldn't\nenjoy my life as much.\nSecond, well, the olive\noil isn't is not as great\nas the yogurt, but I'm trying to optimize\nand there's no perfect\nsolution to what we're doing.\nAnd we're still learning.\nWe don't know what's optimal for me,\nlet alone everybody else.\nBut I'm with you,\nI don't believe that taking a couple\nof spoonfuls of something,\nunless it's high fructose corn\nsyrup is going to hurt you\nbecause I've now got the rest of the day\ntill about eight, 9:00 PM\nof not eating anything.\nAnd that I forgive myself for that.\nAnd that there's a really good point here.\nYou and I were discussing this earlier.\nThe point about doing this is\nthat you try to do your best.\nIf you go from regular living\nto donate the whole day,\nyou're going to fail.\nIt's like quitting smoking, cold turkey.\nIt's easy to chew gum\nand stick the patch on\nbecause your body has to get\nused to all sorts of habits.\nAnd it's social, it's physical,\nputting stuff in your mouth,\nchewing, not just the\nlow blood sugar levels\nand your brain will fight it.\nYour limbic system is going to go,\nhey, do it, do it, do it.\nAnd you're going to have to fight it\nbut once you get through\nit, you'll be better,\nbut you do it in stages.\nDo breakfast first, then do small lunch\nand then eventually cut lunch out.\nDon't go cold turkey\nbecause everyone knows.\nIt's a fact that if you\ntry to do a strict diet\nright out of the gates,\nthey'll almost always fail.\n- Now, I think that captures the essence\nof the fasting rationally\nand irrational approach\nto supplementation very well,\nalong the lines of supplementation.\nWhat about NMN, NR and B3, niacin?\nHow does one, I want to know what you do.\nI also want to know what I should do,\nand I think most people want\nto know what they should do.\nThese are molecules that\nimpact the sirtuin pathway\nimpact the pathways that control aging\nor rates of aging in the epigenome.\nHow do they do that?\nAnd how does one incorporate that\ninto a supplementation protocol?\nShould they choose to do that?\nAll right.\n- Well, disclaimer is I\ndon't recommend anything,\nbut I talk about what I do.\nSo a bit of scientific background,\nthese are two in genes that we discovered\nfirst in yeast cells when I was at MIT\nand then in animals as I\nmoved to Harvard in the 2000's\none of my first post-docs,\nactually literally my\nfirst postdoc Haim Cohen,\npublished a great paper\njust a couple of months ago\nand found that turning\non the sirtuin six gene,\nmiddle of the seven, number\nsix gene is very potent.\nIt extended the lifespan\ndramatically of mice\nthat he engineered both males\nand females, which is great.\nSo what you want to do\nis so naturally boost\nthe activity of these sirtuins.\nThey are genes, but\nthey also make proteins.\nThat's what genes\ntypically make or encode.\nAnd then those proteins\ntake care of the body\nin many different ways as we've discussed.\nSo how do you turn on these\ngenes and make the proteins\nthey make even more active?\nYou want to rev up that system.\nSo exercise will do\nit, fasting will do it.\nWhat about supplementation?\nWell, the first activator of\nthe sirtuins that we discovered\nthat acts on the enzyme\nto make it do a better job\nof cleaning up the body\nand protecting resveratrol\nWe looked at thousands\nof different molecules,\neventually tens of thousands.\nAnd the one that was the best\nwas resveratrol in the dish.\nAnd then we gave it to\nlittle organisms, worms,\nand then flies and\nmice, eventually humans.\nAnd we saw that it activated that enzyme.\nSo resveratrol is one way to activate it.\nAnd you can think of it as the\naccelerator pedal on a car.\nIt revs it up, but there's\nsomething else that the sirtuins\nneed to work and that's NAD\nand is a really small molecule,\nlittle chemical in the\nbody that we need for life.\nIt's used by the body\nfor chemical reactions,\nfor a hundred different\nreactions in the body.\nAnd without it, you're dead\nwithin seconds, you need NAD.\nThe problem that we've\nseen is that NAD levels\ndecline as you become\nobese, as you get older,\nif you don't ever get hungry and the body\nnot only doesn't make enough of it,\nit's chewing it up as well.\nThere's an enzyme called\nCD38 that Eric Verdin\nover at UCSF showed choose up.\nNow he's now at the Buck\nInstitute in California,\nchoose up NAD as you get older.\nSo it's a double whammy.\nYou don't make as much and chew it up,\nwhich is really bad because\nwhat we've shown in my lab\nand so have others is that NAD levels\nare really important for keeping\nthose sirtuins and defenses\nat a useful level.\nAnd you can give a lot of resveratrol\nbut if you don't have the fuel,\nyou're basically accelerating a car\nthat doesn't have enough gas.\nSo you want to do both.\nAnd that's what I do.\nI take a precursor to NAD called\nNMN and the body uses that\nto make the NAD molecule in one step.\nAnd so I know from measuring\ndozens of human beings,\nthat if you take NMN for\nthe time period that I do,\nI've been taking it for years.\nBut if you take it for about two weeks,\nyou'll double on average,\ndouble your NAD levels in the blood.\nOkay, that's not public information.\nThat's from clinical trials\nthat are not yet published\nover the last two years.\nThere are other ways\nto increase NAD levels\nin someone like me, who's\ngetting older, I'm 52 now.\nYou can take NR, which\nis used to make an amend,\nwhich is used to make\nNAD, and both NMN and NR\nare sold by companies in the US.\nNR is laxter phosphate,\nthe phosphate is a small\nchemical the body needs.\nYou've probably heard\nof the atom, phosphorus.\nLet's go back one step.\nHow do you make NR?\nNR gets made from vitamin B3, often.\nYou can also find it in\nmilk and other foods,\nbut sometimes people ask me,\nwhy don't you just take vitamin B3?\nAnd won't that just force\nthe body to make NAD?\nAnd the answer is no, it\ndoesn't work very well.\nWe know this just by doing the experiment,\nbut the reason I think is is that NAD,\nI said, it's a small molecule,\nbut relative to vitamin B3, it's big.\nIt's got those phosphates\non there, it's got a sugar,\nit's got the vitamin B attached.\nSo you've got all these\ncomponents that come together\nto make this very complicated\nlittle molecule called NAD.\nWhen you give NMN, it\ncontains all three components\nthat the body needs to make NAD.\nIf you give NR or just vitamin B3,\nwhich is an even smaller molecule,\nthe body has to find\nthese other components\nfrom somewhere else.\nSo where do you get phosphate,\nwell, the body needs it for\nDNA, it needs it for bones.\nSo high doses of something\nthat requires additional phosphate\nmakes me a little concerned.\nAnd we have compared to\nNMN and NR head-to-head\nin mouse studies, for instance in NMN,\nwe've shown in a cell\npaper a few years ago,\nmakes mice run further, old\nmice can run 50% further\n'cause they had better\nblood flow, better energy.\nNR are at the same dose, did not do that.\nIn fact, it had no effect.\n- I see, dosage wise, if\nI were elect to take NMN\nin supplement form to\nincrease my NAD levels\nand presumably slow my aging,\nhow much NMN should I take?\nWhat's the protocol that you do?\nAnd are the various\nforms that are out there,\nare some better or some worse?\n- Well, I'm always happy\nto tell you what I do\nand what my father does,\nmy 82-year-old father,\nwe take a gram of NMN every day.\n- So it's a gram resveratrol\nand a gram of NMN.\n- Right.\n- Okay a thousand milligrams.\n- Now another important point,\nwhich is, I'm not the\nsame as everybody else.\nI have a different\nmicrobiome, age, sex, right?\nAnd so I've been measuring myself\nand so I know if something's,\nor I think I know if\nsomething's making me better\nor worse based on measuring\n45 different things.\nSo I just want people to be aware\nthat what I do may not perfectly\nor work at all for others,\nbut I have studied, as I said,\ndozens of people who take NMN, at a gram,\nsometimes two grams.\nAnd I know by looking at all those people\nthat without any exceptions,\nthat if you do what I do,\nyour NAD levels go up by\nabout two fold or more.\nAnd so I do that every day,\nthe thousand milligrams.\nNow people sell it.\nNow I never get into brands and all that.\nFirst of all, I don't have\nthe time to measure products.\nI don't know, though I should say,\nI do want to say I'm working on a solution\nfor people to know what works\nand what's real and what\nisn't, but I'm not there yet.\nAnd in the meantime, I would say,\nif you do want to buy this,\nlet's say you want to buy NMN,\nlook for a company that\nis well-established\nthat has high levels of quality control.\nLook for three letters, GMP,\nwhich is good manufacturing practices.\nAnd so that means they make\nit under a certain level\nof quality control.\nYou're not going to find\niron filings in there\nand it probably has the stuff\nin it that they say it does.\nBut so that's all I can say right now.\nI'm working on something that's\ngoing to be much more helpful,\nbut overall, make sure it's\nwhite, crystalline NMN,\nand that to me, it tastes\nlike burnt popcorn.\n- You crack open the capsules,\nand you'll take a little sample\nto make sure it tastes like burnt popcorn.\n- Well, when I'm making\nmy capsules, I'll taste it\nand I do a lot of quality\ncontrol on the stuff that I take.\n- Do you take that gram all at once\nwith the resveratrol\nor do you take it spread\nthroughout the day?\n- It's all in the\nmorning for those things.\nSo if I take Metformin, it's NMN\nand the resveratrol altogether.\nAnd there's a good reason for that.\nIt's all scientific, I try to be.\nThe levels of NAD go up in the morning\nin our bodies naturally.\nOur bodies actually have a\ncycle of NAD, it's not steady.\n- It's Arcadian?\n- It's Acadian.\nIn fact, NAD controls your clock.\nThis was shown by Shin Imai and colleagues\nin this nice science\npaper about a decade ago,\nthat if you disrupt the NAD cycle,\nwhich is controlled by the\nsirtuin gene that we worked on,\nthat is what's telling your\nbody, oh, it's time to eat,\nit's time to go to sleep.\nAnd if you take these, the NMN\nlate at night, for example,\nyou can disrupt your circadian rhythms.\n- Interesting.\n- Conversely, when I travel\nand I want to reset my clock\nto the time zone, I will take\na boost of NMN in the morning\nand I feel great.\n- Does this protocol for you,\ndoes it produce any immediate effects\nof increased energy, et cetera?\nYou mentioned that one would,\nif it's right for them,\nwould have to take it\nfor at least two weeks\nto start to see the NAD levels increase.\nAt that point, when NAD levels increase,\ncould one possibly expect an increase\nin overall energy, focus, et cetera?\nI realize we're not making promises here,\nbut I'm just wondering whether\nor not the only measure\nof whether or not this protocol is working\nis whether or not you die at\nage blank or blank plus 20.\nAnd of course, once you're dead,\nyou can't really know if\nyou would've lived longer\nif you'd done something\ndifferently and vice versa.\n- Sure, well, there was a\nstudy again by Shin Imai\nmy good friend at Washington\nUniversity in St. Louis\nthat showed that improves,\nremember this insulin sensitivity,\nwhich is a good thing.\nBut you can't know your\ninsulin sensitivity\nunless you're measuring glucose,\nhave a glucose monitor on your arm.\n- Do you have one on right now?\n- No, no, I used to, I learned a lot.\n- Yeah, last time I\nsaw you had this thing,\nit looks like a small leach,\nnot a large leach and it was\nmeasuring your blood glucose.\n- They're very informative\nbecause you learn\nwhat your body reacts to\nand grapes were really bad.\nRhonda Patrick agrees with\nthat, but the issue was,\nwas what, where were we, Andrew?\n- The issue is whether\nor not you can expect\nany immediate effects on\nenergy, vitality, focus,\njust even subject.\n- So what do you feel, is the question.\nAnd anecdotally,\n'cause I've been taking\nthis for a long time,\nif I don't take it, I\nstart to feel 50 years old,\nit's horrible.\nI can't think straight.\nIt may be placebo, but who knows?\nBut what we're doing now are\nvery careful clinical trials.\nWe've done the safety for two years,\nand we're now treating elderly patients\nat Harvard Medical School with\nsome wonderful colleagues.\nAnd those people are actually going\nto be an currently in MRIs.\nSo you can measure the\nenergetics and the NAD levels\nin their legs as they\nexercise in real time.\nAnd that will tell us if\nwhat we see in the mice\nis increased endurance actually works.\nIn the meantime, it's fun\nto talk about anecdotes.\nI have a number of athlete friends,\nsome of which have increased their load,\ntheir time in marathons, for example.\nThere's a good friend\nof ours in our circle\nthat is winning marathons at age 50 now.\nAnd he attributes that to\nthe protocol that he's on.\n- Interesting, I haven't\nstarted taking NMN,\nbut I'm planning to do that\nwhen my next birthday arrives,\nwhich is in a couple months.\nBut I do experiments on my\nsister and have for years,\nI have a sister who's three\nyears older than I am,\nwho is very enthusiastic\nabout these protocols.\nAnd I'll tell you that\nafter reading your book,\nI started purchasing\nfor her and giving her\nan NMN supplement and she\nclaims and I believe her.\nShe has a quite sensitive system\nand she's very tuned into it.\nShe feels far and away\nbetter when she takes it,\nas opposed to when she doesn't\nand I've done the control\nexperiment of removing her supply,\nand then giving it back to\nher in this kind of thing.\nSo that's my other laboratory.\nThis is what younger brothers\ndo to their older sisters.\nI have a question about something\nthat if it has no relevance,\nwe can just treat it as a speed\nbump and then move right on.\nAnd the artificial sweeteners,\nthese things that we\nshould say non-glucose,\nincreasing sweetener.\nSo you've got Stevia,\nwhich is a plant basically.\nAnd then you've got\nsucralose and aspartame\nand all these things.\nThere is some evidence that\nI know we're both aware of,\nthey've been publishing\nquite reputable journals,\nshowing that they can\ndisrupt the gut microbiome\nin certain cases in particular saccharin,\nthe one that basically\nnobody uses anymore.\nAnd it's questionable as\nto whether or not Stevia\nhas the same negative effects, et cetera.\nThat's not what this is about,\nbut in terms of the sensation of,\nor the perception of sweet taste,\nis that itself a possible detriment\nto these pro-longevity,\nforgive me for using the term,\nthe pathways.\nIf I were to drink a\ndiet coke during a fast,\nam I somehow disrupting this?\nAnd I'm asking this question,\nbecause I get asked this question a lot.\n- Well, there may be small effects.\nI don't think they're\nworth worrying about.\nJoe Rogan laughed at me 'cause\nI was drinking a diet coke\nduring the first\ninterview I did with them.\nI will drink diet coke, I've\nread the scientific literature.\nAnd again, it's this 5% thing\nthat I think is blowing out of proportion.\nIf I was to put a number\non it, I would say,\nif eating a high sugary meal\nor drinking a sugar-filled soda,\nwhat is that, 30 grams of sugar?\nLet's say that's a 10\nout of 10 bad for you.\nA diet coke might be a one.\nAnd if I'm, which am I going to do?\nI could have a 10 or a one\nor go without in my life.\nI'll do the one on occasion.\nI try to avoid them because I\ndon't like the ones as much.\nBut you can't say that sucralose\nis equivalent to drinking a sugary soda.\nThere's just no comparison.\nAnd I think suc, what is it?\nStevia, I do use Stevia whenever I can,\nbecause it's a naturally sourced product.\nAnd I haven't seen any good evidence yet\nthat it's bad for you.\nBut I think a lot of this is overblown,\nand a lot of it's the media trying\nto give equal weight to stories\nas you know as a scientist.\nIt can be frustrating\nwhen something's a 10\nand something's a one,\nand they're equated.\n- How do I say this respectfully?\nI think if science\njournalists were required\nto post their credentials\nalongside their name, [chuckles]\nthen people would take the articles into,\nwith additional grain of salt, right?\nI mean, in other words,\nthat I think that the science media\nis mainly generated\naround two specific goals.\nOne is to make people very, very afraid\nor get people very, very excited,\nand oftentimes the get people excited part\nis sponsored content,\nand I think that's overlooked in any case.\nThank you for that.\nI want to talk about iron and iron load.\nWe were talking earlier about ferritin.\nAnd of course, women menstruate.\nAnd so their iron needs\nare greater than people,\nmen that don't menstruate\nor women that don't menstruate.\nI don't think we can get right down\ninto how much iron somebody needs\nbecause it'll vary person to person.\nBut I was surprised to learn that iron\nis actually going to accelerate\nthe aging process in various contexts.\n- Well, this is a new\nfinding out of Spain.\nManuel Serrano's lab has\nfound that excess iron\nwill increase the number of\nsenescent cells in the body.\nAnd senescent cells are these zombie cells\nthat accumulate as you get\nolder and they sit there\nand they cause inflammation mainly\nand also can cause cancer.\nAnd it's found that if\nyou get rid of these cells\nor never accumulate\nthem, you stay younger.\nIn animals, and there's some\nreally interesting studies\nout of Mayo Clinic in humans as well.\nSo iron is a pro-senescent metal.\nAnd so what I think\nis that if you're taking\nexcess iron as a supplement,\nyou're probably accelerating\nyour aging process.\nThe other thing that I\nfound really interesting\nis I've looked at hundreds of thousands\nof people's metabolism and\ntheir blood biomarkers.\nI was one of the first people\nin InsideTracker as a board member,\nand I'm still their scientific lead guy.\nSo I can look anonymously\nat hundreds of thousands\nof people's blood work.\nAnd we also know how fit\nthey are, how old they are.\nSome of them are marathon runners,\nsome of them are CrossFit.\nAnd there's a signature of health\nthat actually is different\nthan your average person.\nNow, I'm not going to\nsay bad things about MDs\n'cause a lot of my best friends are MDs\nand I work with them at\nHarvard Medical School.\nThe issue though, is\nthat with MD training,\nthere's a scale of what's normal,\nand if you're out of that normal range,\nsomething must be wrong,\nthat's the paradigm that they work under.\nBut first of all, everybody's different,\nand you want to know their baseline\nand track people over years to\nknow what's normal for them.\nAnd what I find for example,\nis people who are really\nhealthy and live the way I do\nand have a diet that's fairly\nvegetarian, but not strict,\nstill have slightly low hemoglobin levels,\nslightly low iron, slightly low ferritin,\nbut we have super amounts\nof energy, we're not anemic.\nAnd we're getting along great in life.\nBut a doctor who just\nlooks at that might say,\noh, we need to give you more iron.\nAll right, so what I'm\ngetting at is an example of,\nwe need to personalize medicine\nand look at people over the long run\nto know what works for them\nand what's healthy for them,\nand not just work towards\nthe average human,\nbut work towards what's optimal for human.\n- I love that answer.\nYou mentioned tracking\nand tracking over time.\nAnd this is a really interesting area\nthat I know you have been\nfocused on for a long time.\nI've been getting blood worked\non about every six months\nfrankly, since I was in college.\nI just got, I like data\nand I got interested in\nsupplementation and exercise\n'cause it made me feel better,\nbut I also want to know what\nwas going on under the hood.\nSo you get numbers back, you\nget this hormone, that hormone,\nthis blood glucose measure, et cetera.\nHow do you make sense of the data?\nI mean, what InsideTracker is doing aside,\nhow do you personally\nmake sense of the data\nin ways that might differ from the way\nthat a standard MD might\nlook at one of these charts?\nBecause the standard practice is to say,\nis it red, yellow, or green, right?\nIs it basically too high or too low?\nIs it somewhere close to\nthe margins or are you okay?\nAre you in these ranges?\nAre there any things\nthat you pay attention to\nthat you think are\nparticularly interesting\nfor people to just take note of?\nI mean, we're not asking you\nto go against anybody's physician.\nBut what sorts of things\nshould people start\nto educate themselves about\nin terms of what these\nmolecules are on their charts\nif they choose to get them,\nand what do you look at?\n- Yeah, well, there's a lot there.\nThe first is that you\nshould be tracking things,\nbecause one measurement isn't enough.\nThese things vary and over time.\nAnd if you can have a\ndecade or more of data,\nit's super important, informative,\nas you know, well know, as you know.\nSo the physician, interestingly,\nmy physician, let's\ntake him as an example.\nSo he sees me, he says,\n\"How are you feeling?\"\n\"I'm feeling great.\"\n\"Okay, see you next\nyear,\" that's craziness.\nAnyway, so I say, okay, stop.\nLet's talk a little bit about.\n- Let me educate you, that's\nwhat David tells his physician.\nI imagine that the\n12-year-old David Sinclair\nsays to a physician,\n\"Listen, let's have a\ndifferent discussion.\"\nIs that how it works?\n- It is.\nHe finds me pretty annoying\nas does my dentist.\nBut so I say, so hang\non, I've got this data.\nI've got the InsideTracker data.\nSo I pull that up on the screen,\nand I'm showing him the\nchanges in my cholesterol\nand my CRP, which is\ninflammatory marker as you know.\nAnd we're going through it,\nand you can see things change over time,\nand I've corrected them\nas they go slightly out of\nthe optimal range for me,\nwhich is different than\nwhat he would do, of course.\nBut what was funny is that he says,\nthis is great, I love this data.\nBut I'm not allowed to get\nthis because of course,\nthe insurance companies won't pay for it.\nSo again, you can pay out of pocket.\nIt's not super expensive.\nI would say, if you save a\nbit of money on a coffee,\nyou can afford this kind of stuff.\nBut the main point is that\ndoctors do like this data.\nIt's just that they're\nunable to spend the money\non every one of their patients to get it.\n- Is there a code word\nthat someone can use with their physician\nthat will trigger a\ncomprehensive blood test?\nI keep trying to figure\nout what's the code\nthat one needs to ask\nor tell their doctor,\nI'm feeling blank so that\nthey get a full blood panel.\n- Well.\n- Do you have to be hemorrhaging\nfrom the gut or something?\n- Well, I usually use the WTH method,\nwhich is what the hell?\nAnd then he says, \"Okay, we'll do it.\"\n- 'Cause I think a lot of\npeople out there are thinking,\nlook, I'd love to have blood\nwork repeatedly over time,\nbut that's hard to get\nfor financial reasons,\nbut also a lot of people\njust don't know how\nto approach the conversation.\nAnd this is one of the things\nthat I hope that we can educate people on,\nthat they deserve to know what's\ngoing on inside their body,\nand that it makes a\ndoctor's visit worthwhile,\nand that you don't have to\nfeign illness in order to do it.\n- Right, yeah, and a lot of people do.\nSo I would say, if you\ncan't afford these tests,\nthere are increasing number of companies\nthat offer these tests,\nInsideTracker is one of them.\nAnd you just do it a couple\nof times a year at a minimum.\nAnd then you can share\nthat with your doctor.\nIf you can't afford that, then\nI would say to your doctor,\nhere are the main ones\nthat Andrew and David do.\n- Yep, and we must.\nAnd there's an email\nthat is something like 555,\nor a phone number, rather, it's 555-5555.\nI think if they have any complaints,\nthey can just call that number.\nDavid will pick up on the\neast coast business hours\nand I'll pick up outside of those hours.\n- But there was the\nmain ones, I would say.\nYour blood sugar levels,\nyou want to do your HbA1c,\nwhich is your average glucose\nlevels over the month.\nThere's CRP, which I\nmentioned for inflammation.\n- Yeah, let's talk about\nC-reactive protein for a second.\n'Cause I think it's been shown\nto be an early marker\nof macular degeneration\nof heart disease, of a\nvariety of different things.\nCRP is something\nthat we don't hear enough about, I think.\nMaybe, what do you know\nabout CRP that I don't,\nI'm guessing a lot, but.\n- Oh, it was originally picked up\nas something that was\nassociated with heart disease\nin the Framingham study, I believe.\nIt is the best marker for\ncardiovascular inflammation\nand is also, we use it as\na predictor of longevity,\nand its levels go up with mortality.\nAnd so this is an association,\nbut there's enough data that I would say,\nif you have high levels of CRP,\nyou need to get your levels down quickly.\nAnd the levels usually go up with age\nand with levels of inflammation.\nSo the ways to get it down\nwould be to switch the diet,\neat less, try to eat more vegetables.\nYou'll find it will come down,\nand there are also drugs that can do it.\nAnti-inflammatories can do it as well.\nBut CRP is, it's actually, hCRP,\nthere's a high sensitive\nhCRP, your doctor will know.\nGet one of those readings.\n'Cause if you've got\nnormal blood sugar levels,\nyour doctor, or fasting\nblood sugar levels,\nyour doctor might say you're fine.\nBut a lot of people\nhave normal blood sugar,\nbut have high CRP, which is\njust as bad for you longterm,\nand can predict a future heart attack.\n- On the lines of heart attack.\nI want your thoughts on cholesterol\nand serum cholesterol\nand dietary cholesterol.\nI cannot, for the life of me,\nget my arms around this literature.\nAnd even if I ignore all\nthe essentially nonsense\nthat's out there in various\nsocial media groups,\nas saying cholesterol is the\nworst thing in the world,\nor cholesterol is not,\nor dietary cholesterol has nothing to do\nwith serum cholesterol and\nnothing to do with longevity.\nI can't seem to sort\nthrough the very basic data\nthat essentially ask,\nis having high levels of LDL\ngoing to kill me earlier?\nShould I be striving to always\nreduce LDL and increase HDL?\nIs that a reasonable goal?\nAnd if so,\nis dietary cholesterol the\nprimary determinant of that?\nAnd just as a final point about this,\nI am aware of quite good data\nthat shows that anorexics,\npeople that essentially eat no food,\nunless you force them to,\ncan often have very high LDL.\nSo their dietary cholesterol\nis essentially zero,\nand so they're manufacturing\na lot of their own.\nSo realize this isn't your\nprimary area of expertise,\nbut you're a smart guy\nand you think about this\nkind of stuff a lot.\nWhat do you think is going on\nwith the cholesterol literature?\nAnd will we ever get to the bottom of this\nas a scientific and medical community?\nBecause to me, it is rather perplexing.\n- It is, but you can get\nthrough the politics.\nI know a fair bit about cholesterol\n'cause it's in my family history.\nAnd I was headed for an early death,\nmy grandmother had a stroke 30,\nthat's how bad I am in\nterms of my genetics.\nSo I went on a statin, and I\nknow there's a lot of people\nwho say that statins long-term are bad.\nIt's associated with Alzheimer's disease.\nI've been taking a statins since I was 29.\nAnd that's 'cause I forced my same doctor\nto give me the statin,\nthe conversation was something like this.\nYou're too young to be on a statin.\nAnd I said, what?\nYou want me to have a heart attack\nbefore you give me\nsomething, give it to me now.\nSo 29, I'd been on a satin,\nand my cholesterol was\nway up in beyond 300,\nwhich is a massive mess up.\nBasically my blood was creamy to look at.\nSo I've now got my cholesterol down\nto low, low levels to what would it be.\nYou can check on my InsideTracker,\nbut so my ratio of HDL to LDL,\nwhich you want to be less\nthan five, is now two,\nand the LDL is below a\nhundred, so it's all good.\nAnd I've measured my\ncardiovascular health with an MRI.\nI've got a movie of my heart beating.\nI've still got a heart of a\n20-year old, so that's working,\nI'm willing to forgo the risk\nthat the statin is causing problems later\nbecause of my family history.\nBut other people, I would say,\nbe aware that statins\naren't perfect drugs.\nThere were some interesting new ones.\nThere's one called the PCSK9 inhibitor,\nwhich is, I think fortnightly,\nevery two weeks injection,\nthat blocks the release\nof LDL from the liver.\nAnd then that seems to be\ngreat for lowering cholesterol,\nbut also has other benefits\nthat might be prolongevity.\nAnd there were some people\nthat I was just talking to\non the cutting edge of this,\nand their doctors are\ntrying them on this drug\ninstead of the statin.\nSo you could talk to your doctor about.\n- Do you avoid dietary\ncholesterol for that reason also?\nRed meat, butter.\nI mean, I have been to love butter.\nI love red meat.\nI realized there's some people who don't.\nMy cholesterol is a little bit high,\nbut I'm working to bring that down a bit,\nalthough not by altering\nmy food intake yet.\nBut what do you think is the relationship\nbetween dietary cholesterol\nand serum cholesterol,\nand what's going on with the liver?\nWhy are anorexics?\nWhy is there a certain cholesterol so high\nwhen they're eating nothing?\n- Well, there've been in a\nnumber of papers over the years\nthat have been ignored.\nAnd our friend, Peter Attia,\nbrought to my attention recently,\na new study that I think definitively said\nthat dietary cholesterol\nhas almost zero impact\non blood cholesterol levels.\n- Good.\n- Yeah, so I'm annoyed\n'cause I'd been avoiding eggs\nand butter for most of my\nlife and I didn't have to.\nSo I have eggs-\n- Plenty of time, or\nat least in your case.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo that's the thing.\nYou can eat these foods\nthat were ones banned\nbecause it's very difficult\nto take cholesterol up\ninto the body from the gut.\nAnd most of it's being\nsynthesized in the body.\n- Well, I'm just pausing\nthere for a second\nbecause I think that it's\nwhat we've been told.\nSix meals a day, eat a\nlot of grains and fruits\nand this kind of thing, avoid cholesterol.\nI mean, basically everything we learned\nin the '80s and '90s and early 2000s\nis getting flipped on its head now.\nBut, and I think this\nis a very strong caveat\nthat's important to mention, amino acids.\nIn particular, the amino acids\nthat come from animal products, right?\nSeem to have some pro aging\neffect on them, right?\nAt least the way that I've\nheard you describe your diet.\nAnd I'm somebody who\nenjoys meat, I like it.\nBut so I'm by no means, a vegan at all.\nBut I've heard you say\nyou eat mostly plants,\nbut a little bit of fish\nor chicken or something\nof that sort of eggs or.\nBut is that specifically\nto avoid excessive amino acid intake?\nOr is it something specific about plants\nthat excites you with\nrespect to? [chuckles]\nI mean, vegetables are\ndelicious too, but what is it?\nIs it something great about plants\nor is it something bad\nabout when I think of meat,\nI guess the biologist in me\nthinks amino acids, right?\nI don't think top sirloin,\nI think amino acids.\nAnd I think top sirloin as I'm eating it,\nbut really what they are, are amino acids,\nincluding leucine.\n- Yeah, well, there are two\ngood things about plants,\nand neither of them is taste for me.\nI would eat steak all the time if I could.\nI did when I was a kid, I'm an Australian.\nBut plants have two benefits.\nOne is that they're highly nutritious,\nand they'll give you a lot of the vitamins\nand nutrients that I need.\nI don't take multivitamin,\nI don't want to have the\nexcess iron in my body.\nSo there's that high density nutrition.\nSo those dark leaves, if\nit's a spinach salad, great.\nThe second is that there\nis what's called xenohormetic\nmolecules in plants.\nThat term, xenohormesis is a term\nthat I came up with\nwith my friend, Conrad.\nHow it's, which means\nstressed plants make molecules\nthat benefit your health.\nI'll break it down.\nXeno means between species,\nand hormesis is the term,\nwhatever doesn't kill\nyou makes you stronger\nand live longer.\nAnd the idea is that when\nplants are stressed out,\nthink of a great vine that's dried out\nand then starting to harvest the grapes,\nwhich is typically how it's done.\nThey are full with resveratrol,\nbecause resveratrol is\na plant defense molecule\nthat I think is made\nto activate those\nsirtuin genes in a plant.\nSo plants have sirtuins just like we do.\nBut by purifying or at least concentrating\nin a light-proof bottle and\nkeeping it out of the air,\nwe stabilize the xenohormetic molecule,\nor it's a cocktail, not just\none, there's others in wine.\nWe then ingest those and get the benefits\nof activating our own defenses,\nbecause our food was getting stressed out.\nAnd by stressed, I don't mean\npsychologically stressed.\nI mean, biologically stressed.\nAnd so I try to eat plants\nthat have gone through a bit of stress.\nThey might be brightly colored,\nthey've had too much sun\nor got nibbled on by a caterpillar.\nSo you go to places where it's\norganic or it's fresh, local,\nand those are the plants\nthat aren't perfect,\nand they probably have high concentrations\nof these molecules.\nAnd in addition, I also\nbuy the supplements\nto make sure I'm getting\nenough of those as well.\n- Which supplements mimic that?\n- So resveratrol will,\nthere's another one called quercetin,\nor quercetin, some people call it,\nwhat you find in trace\namounts in apples and onions.\nAnd we also showed back in 2003\nthat it activates sirtuins as well.\nBut others have, 20 years later,\nfound that it kills senescent cells\nor helps kill senescent cells.\nSo it's a double whammy\nwith that molecule.\n- And are you actively\npicking out the peaches\nthat look like they were\nnibbled on by a caterpillar?\n- No, but I don't worry if\nthey've been banged up a bit.\n- What's the story with antioxidants?\nAre they of any value whatsoever,\nbecause the way that you\ndescribe them at the beginning,\nand what I've heard recently\nis that they are not all\nthe rage for anti-aging.\nWhat are they doing that's useful?\nShould we be seeking\nout antioxidants anyway\nfor other seller health purposes?\n- Well, yeah, antioxidants\nare not going to hurt you\nunless you take mega doses.\nWe do need some oxidants\nfor our immune system.\nAnd there's even, what's\ncalled mitohormesis,\nwhich is your mitochondria power packs,\nneed to have a little bit\nof these free radicals\nto be able to function.\nSo you don't want to overdose\non these antioxidants,\nvitamin C, vitamin E, don't overdo it.\n- You don't take a multivitamin, correct?\n- Right.\n- I think I'm going to stop\nafter this conversation\n'cause I've always just taken one\nfor the kind of insurance purpose,\nwhich is a stupid purpose.\nNot actual insurance, but just thinking,\noh cap top off on my ACBD.\n- Right, and I'll pee out what\nI don't need, right, sure.\n- But that never bothered me.\nThe whole expensive pee thing never got.\nThat argument never got\nmade because of that.\nA good vitamin is not that expensive.\nI just figured better safe than sorry,\nbut it may be that it's detrimental.\n- Well, it can in the case of iron\nas we discussed and the antioxidants.\nSo when I came into the aging\nfield in the early 1990s,\nit was all about antioxidants.\nAnd we thought that enzymes\nby the name of catalyze\nand superoxide dismutase, well,\nthey're going to be the key to longevity.\nIt turns out that it's\nlargely been a failure\nthat giving animals and\nhumans antioxidants,\nhaven't had the longevity\nbenefits that we dreamed of.\nAnd the main reason is that\nthere's a lot more going on\nthan just free radical damage.\nThe epigenome gets disrupted,\nwe've got these proteins misfolding.\nAnd so the problem really has\nbeen that we didn't realize\nthat you need to turn on\nthe body's natural defenses against that\nplus a whole host of other\nthings to get the true benefits.\nBut I'm not going to say\nit's a problem taking it,\nan antioxidant drink,\npomegranate juice for one\nis full of good stuff,\nincluding xenohormetic molecules.\nBut resveratrol is a good case in point,\nwhich is when I worked on resveratrol\nas a longevity molecule,\nfirst we showed it in yeast\nand worms and flies and mice.\nBefore that, it was\nthought that resveratrol\nwas good for your heart in red\nwine when you drink red wine,\nbecause it's an antioxidant.\nSo then we showed that\nit extended the lifespan\nof yeast cells through this\ngenetic pathway, the sirtuins.\nAnd we then tested whether resveratrol,\nif we change one atom\nto make it not an antioxidant, guess what?\nIt still worked fine.\nSo it wasn't its anti-oxidant activity\nthat was extending lifespan.\nIt was its ability to turn on\nthe yeast's defenses against aging.\nConversely, when we gave\nthe yeast antioxidants,\nthey lived shorter.\nSo yeah, that was the\nbeginning of my transformation\ninto thinking turn on the body's defenses,\ndon't give it the antioxidants.\n- This is an opportunity\nfor me to say something\nthat I've been wanting\nto say for a long time,\nwhich is that, what's so\nwonderful about science\nis that because the goal is mechanism,\nyou can really start to understand\nas you just described, what\nactually mediates a process\nis very different than\nwhat modulates a process.\nI mean, if a fire alarm goes\noff in the building right now,\nit's going to modulate our attention.\nThat doesn't mean that it\ncontrols our attention,\nit's not mechanistically relevant.\nAnd so I think this\nthing about antioxidants\nis one of these cases,\nit sounds like where it's\nin the right ballpark,\nbut until one really unveils\nthe mechanism as you have,\nyou can be, one can or in a field,\ncan be badly wrong for a\nvery long period of time.\nIt sounds like the sirtuins\nand really getting down to\nthe guts of the machinery\nof what causes cells to age\nis really what it's about.\nZooming way out, what\nare the behavioral tools\nthat one can start to think about\nin terms of ways to modulate these?\nBasically the way that DNA\nis being expressed and functioning.\nI've heard you talk before\nabout hormesis of other\nsorts, cold exposure.\nWe talked about fasting.\nWe talked about exercise in broad terms,\nbut what about any evidence, if it exists,\nas to whether or not aerobic training\nversus weight training,\nthese sorts of things.\nIn other words, what\nare the sorts of things\nthat people can do to improve\ntheir sirtuin pathway?\nAnd I realized that there are caveats.\nWe can't go directly from\na behavior dissertations,\nbut in the general theme,\nwhat can people do, what do you do?\n- Right, well, we know\nthat that aerobic exercise\nin mice and rats raises their NAD levels\nand their levels of sirt,\none of the genes goes up\ntwo actually, number one and number three.\nWhat we don't know yet\nis what type of exercise\nis optimal to get them to change.\nWe will learn, we're doing work.\nNow it's revealed that we're doing work\nwith the military in the US,\nto try and understand that kind of thing.\nAnd I'll always tell you and the public,\nwhen I don't know something\nI'm not going to extrapolate.\nBut what do I do?\nI base my exercise on the\nscientific literature,\nwhich has shown that\nmaintaining muscle mass\nis very important for a number of reasons.\nThe two main ones are,\nyou want to maintain your hormone levels.\nI'm an older male,\nlosing my testosterone\nand muscle mass over time.\nAnd by exercising, I will\nmaintain that and have,\nin fact, I probably haven't\nhad a body like this\nsince I was 20.\nSo that's one of the benefits\nof having this lifestyle.\n- Sorry to interrupt you.\nYou do know we did an episode on hormones\nand there are data in humans\nthat show that there are some\nmales in their '80s and '90s\nwhere their testosterone is equivalent\nto the average of 25 and 30-year-olds.\nI can get you that information,\nis really impressive studies.\nUnfortunately, they didn't\ninclude a lot of information\nabout the lifestyle factors, et cetera.\nBut this idea that testosterone\ngoes down with age,\nit might be the trend,\nbut it's not necessarily a prerequisite.\n- Right, I believe in naturally increasing\nand maintaining these hormone levels\nand I've been measuring\nthem for a long time.\nAnd I could see for me,\nmy testosterone levels\nwere steadily, levels were going down.\n- And then you got tenure\nand they went back up again.\n[both chuckle]\n- No, I actually became complacent.\nAnd it was the worst.\nActually my age changed in the\nwrong direction after that,\n'cause I was relaxed.\n- Interesting.\n- And not worried about the future.\nBut then I got serious.\nAnd I actually, according to\nthe InsideTracker algorithm,\ngot my age down from 58 to\n31 in a matter of months.\nSo that was a big drop.\nAnd I've been getting steadily younger\nover the last 10 years,\naccording to that\nmeasurement, the blood test.\n- What about estrogen?\nBecause women are different in the sense\nthat they do the number of eggs that they,\nand the ovaries change over time, right?\nDo you think that they can\nmaintain estrogen levels\nin over longer periods of time\nusing some of these same protocols?\n- Well, yeah, I get into trouble\nfrom a certain university\nwhen I talk about this too much.\n- About estrogen?\n- Just about fertility and long story.\nI don't want to get too\nmuch into the anecdotes,\nbut I'll tell you the science,\nwhich is that if you take a\nmouse and put it on fasting\nor caloric restriction\nfor up until the point\nwhere it should be in fertile,\nso that's about at a year of age,\na mouse gets infertile, female mouse.\n- Due to fasting or\ndue to simply to aging?\n- Due to aging, due to aging.\nThe fasting, it's not extreme fast,\nit's just less calories.\nThen you put them back on a regular food,\nand they become fertile again\nfor many, many months afterwards.\nSo the effect on slowing down aging\nis also on the reproductive system.\n- Interesting.\n- And so that, I wouldn't\nsay to any woman,\nI wouldn't think that they\nshould become super skinny\nto try and preserve fertility,\nthat's not what I'm saying.\nBut these pathways that we work on these,\nsirtuins are known to delay\ninfertility in female animals.\nCase in point, I'm one of the lead authors\non a paper where we used NMN.\nRemember, this is the gas, the fuel,\nthe petrol for the sirtuins.\nWe gave old mice.\nOne group of mice was 16 months old.\nRemember they became infertile\nat 12, gave them NMN.\nAnd I think it was only six weeks later,\nthey had offspring.\nThey became fertile again,\nwhich goes against biology,\nthe textbook biology,\nwhich is that female\nmammals run out of eggs.\nTurns out that's not true.\nYou can rejuvenate the\nfemale reproductive system,\nand even get them to\ncome out of mouseopause\nas we call it.\nSo that's a whole new\nparadigm in biology as well.\n- That's super interesting.\nSorry to interrupt you,\nbut I'm reminded by a set of studies\nthat were done by your former colleagues\n'cause they're no longer there,\nDavid Hubel and Torsten Wiesel,\nmy scientific great grandparents.\nWon the Nobel prize for discovering,\nwhat are called critical periods,\nthis phase of early development\nwhen the brain is extremely plastic.\nAnd a big part of their work\nwas to show that after a certain point,\nthe critical period shuts down,\nessentially the brain can't\nchange or not nearly as much.\nAnd then people came\nalong later and showed\nthat you could open up these\ncritical periods again,\nbut very briefly,\nand it takes a very specific\nstimulus, essentially,\nhigh degrees of focus, et cetera.\nHowever, there's a well-known\nphenomenon in this literature\nwhere if you take an\nanimal and to some degree,\nthis has been shown in humans as well,\nand you let them pass\nthrough the critical period,\nbut then you essentially\nsensory deprive them.\nYou take away experience,\nyou close both eyes.\nYou essentially reopen\nthe critical period.\nSo it seems like I couldn't\nhelp but mention this,\nthat there's this parallel\nbetween what we're talking\nabout here with fertility\nand neuroplasticity, where yes,\nthere is a timer where\ncertain things are available\nto the organism early in life,\nand then they tend to taper off.\nIt's not an open and\nshut, but they taper off.\nBut then a deprivation\ncan actually reactivate\nthe availability of that process.\nForgive me, I just couldn't\nhelp him mention it,\nbut to me,\nso both of those things\nare associated with youth,\nfertility and neuroplasticity.\nAnd so I think that\nit'd be so interesting.\nI'd love to collaborate with you on this\nto explore how neuroplasticity\nmight actually be regulated\nby these things like the sirtuins.\n- Right, and the sirtuins\ndo control memory\nin neurons as well.\nSo what I think is really interesting\nis that what we're learning from work\nthat you and your colleagues have done\nand in my lab as well,\nis that the body has\nremarkable powers of healing\nand recovering from illness and injury.\nAnd what we once thought\nwas a one-way street\nand you just can't repair,\nor you can't get over these diseases,\nyou can reset the system,\nand the body can really get rejuvenated\nin ways that in the future will wonder,\nwhy didn't we work on this earlier?\nThe future of humanity\nis more like us walking\naround like Deadpool.\nWe'll probably be cleaner,\nand we won't smell as badly,\nbut Deadpool, if you don't know,\ncan get injured and just recover.\nIt's very hard to injure this guy,\nand we're going to be the same.\nThere are many species\nyou cut off the limb,\nthe limb grows back.\n- Salamanders or.\n- Yeah.\nWe are now learning how\nto tap into that system.\nAnd in part, what we're doing\nis reversing the age of those cells,\nand telling them how to read\nthe genes correctly again,\nreversing the age of that epigenome.\nAnd when you do that, the cells,\nthe brain, for instance, the skin.\nWe did the optic nerve.\n- Let's talk about those\nresults for a second.\nThen I want to make sure that we return\nto some of these behavioral protocols.\nYou have this amazing paper\nat the end of last year,\ncover article, full article in nature,\nshowing that essentially a small menu\nof transcription factors,\nwhich control gene expression, et cetera,\ncould essentially reverse\nthe age of neurons in the eye\nand rescue those cells against damage.\nEssentially allow blind mice to see again,\nand offset degeneration\nof these retinal cells,\nincredible paper, and\nsuch a boom to the field.\nWhere does that stand now in\nterms of human clinical trials?\nI mean, how do, what are you envisioning\nin terms of the trajectory of those data\nfrom mice into human someday?\n- Right, well, to get to\nthe point immediately,\nwe're going to be testing\nthe treatment on monkeys,\njust for safety reasons.\nAnd then the first patient\nshould be done sometime in 2022,\nearly 2023, and we're going\nto try to recover blindness.\n- This involves making an injection\nof a virus into the eye, right?\nRight now, there's no\nway that I am aware of\nto manipulate these transcription factors\nthrough a pill or some other?\n- And that's why, we working on in my lab\nat Harvard right now.\nSo it will be-\n- It will base moderation of-\n- Well you pop a pill in the whole body\ngets rejuvenated by 20 years.\nThat's what we're aiming for.\nNow we do it with gene therapy\nin the eye and other places.\nSo in the IES, it's single injection,\nthe genes go into the retina\nand we can turn it on,\nwith a drug called doxycycline.\nAnd we do that in the mice\nfor four to eight weeks,\nthen the eye gets younger.\nWe can measure that' cause\nyou can measure the clock.\nAnd then the vision\ncomes back in those mice.\nAnd I don't see any reason,\nwhy it shouldn't work in people\nbecause it's the same structures\nand mechanisms that are\non in the human as well.\nNow these-\n- And it's one injection.\n- It's one.\n- I should mention injections into the eye\nobviously nobody should do this\noutside of a ophthalmology clinic.\nAnd there definitely by\nan ophthalmologist but,\nthe injections into the eye\nare painless if done correctly\nby the right person.\nIt sounds dreadful, but it's actually,\nI've seen it done hundreds of times.\nI've done it, thousands of times\nand it's not to myself,\nbut to other creatures.\nAnd there's a way of doing this\nas completely painless to the person-\n- Oh you don't feel it.\nIt's a tiny, tiny needle too.\nBut the great thing about this is that\nit's a one-time treatment.\nThose genes go into the back\nof the eye and stay there,\nforever.\nAnd you can just turn\nthem on whenever you want.\nSo what we found is you can\nturn them on in the mice,\nthey get their vision back,\nand then you turn it off again.\nAnd so far, many months out,\nthe benefit has remained,\nbut if it does decline,\nwe'll just turn it back\non and reset the system,\nrinse and repeat.\nSo one day what's exciting is that\nwe could potentially do\nthis across the entire body\nand just take this antibiotic,\nevery five years and go\nback time and time again.\n- And thinking about the body\nand what's going on under\nthe head I'm amazed,\nstill that there isn't a\nsimple, affordable technology\nthat would allow me to just\nlook into my body and see\nwhether or not there are\nany tumors growing anywhere.\nI mean, it's not that hard\nto look into the body.\nI mean that the technology exists.\nwhy hasn't anybody created an at home\nor pseudo at home solution,\nlike a clinic where you can go\nand pay 50 bucks or a hundred bucks\nand see if you have any\ntumors growing anymore.\n- Yeah, it's still expensive.\nYou can get your doctor\nto try to get you in,\nthere's some companies\nthat offer blood tests\nthat look at circulating DNA,\nthat'll measure it.\nWe're getting there.\nIt's still probably five to 10 years away\nfrom being really cheap.\nYou can do things like a\ncolon cancer test at home.\nI think it's a hundred\nand something dollars.\nYou ship off your shit,\nexcuse my language,\nand they measure it.\nAnd they tell you if\nyou've got colon cancer,\nwith high probability,\nI did that during the pandemic\nbecause I didn't want\nto get a colonoscopy.\n- Mhmh, is it more accurate or\nas accurate as a colonoscopy?\n- I believe it's close\nto being as accurate.\nThe downside is that during a colonoscopy,\nthey can pinch off the polyps\nthat are looking dangerous,\nwhereas this obviously isn't that,\nbut it's certainly easier to do.\nAnd my father who's\nAustralian tells me that\nit's free for Australians.\nThey get this test routinely.\n- Mhmh, interesting.\nI want to return to the topic\nthat I took us away from.\nSo I apologize, which\nis behavioral protocols.\nDo you regularly do the cold shower thing?\nIce baths, cold water swims,\nare you into that whole biz?\n[David chuckles]\n- Well, you do know that\nI've done it at least once\n'cause we did it together.\n- That's right.\nNot the same bath, just to be very clear,\nsame sauna, different ice baths,\n[David chuckles]\nthe idea of Sinclair\nand Huberman taking an\nice bath together it's a,\nit might warm some people's hearts,\nbut just to be very clear, different,\nsame ice bath, different, different times.\n- Yeah, thank you for clarifying.\n- [Andrew] Yeah.\nI don't do them regularly.\nI do try to sleep cool.\nI sleep better anyway.\nI try to dress without\na lot of warm clothes.\nI'm here in a T-shirt and\nit's middle of summer,\nbut in winter, I'll try\nto wear a T-shirt too.\n- So you're challenging your\nsystem to thermoregulate?\n- Right, right.\nI've got this,\nhypothesis with Ray Cronise.\nWe published what's called The\nMetabolic Winter Hypothesis,\nwhich is, few tens of\nthousands of years ago,\nwe were either hungry or cold or both\nand we really experience that now.\nAnd so, we try to give\nourselves the metabolic winter\nand part of the problem I\nthink with the obesity epidemic\nis that we're never cold and cold,\nwhen you're cold you have to burn energy.\nIt may be only slightly,\nbut over the whole night,\nif you're a little bit cool,\nyou'll actually expend more energy.\nSo I try to do that,\nbut I'm not a big fan of cold showers.\nThe sauna, I don't have access\nto my gym as much as I did.\nSo, but I do want to get back into it.\nI used to do it regularly with my son\nand I posted on Instagram once\nthat he could stay in there for 15 minutes\nand I could only stay in for about three.\nAnyway, long story short,\nI try to compensate with\nchanges in my diet and exercise\nuntil I get back into it.\n- You reminded me of something\nthat I meant to ask earlier\nthat obesity reduces NAD\nlevels and accelerates aging.\nHow?\nI mean, okay.\nSo again, this is the,\nthe scientist in the us,\nso someone's carrying a lot\nof excess adipose tissues,\nsubcutaneous and,\nvisceral fat.\nBut why should that reduce NAD in any ways\nthat are independent of\neffects on glucose and insulin?\nIf it, you know,\nis there's something direct\nabout white adipose tissue.\nAnd the reason I ask this,\nis not simply to dig into mechanism alone,\nbut I think there are\nreally interesting data now\nthat fat actually gets neural innervation.\nI mean,\nit's not just a,\nit's not just stored fuel.\nIt's stored fuel,\nthat's acting as an\nendocrine organ, essentially.\nSo,\nwhy would being fat\nmake people age faster?\n- Yeah, that's a question that,\nis so obvious, but so few people ask it,\nthat's what makes you a good scientist.\nAnd so that we don't know,\nbut I'll give you my best\nanswer, which is that,\nobesity comes along with\na lot of problems that,\ninclude a lot of senescent cells in fat,\nif you stain old fat for\nsenescent cells, it lights up.\n- Mhmh.\nAnd when you kill off those cells,\nat least in mice, and maybe in humans,\nit looks like the fat is\nless toxic to the body.\n'Cause those senescent cells\nin their fat are secreting\nthese inflammatory molecules\nthat will accelerate aging as we now know.\nWe talk about the sirtuins in NAD.\nSo if we,\nif we just look philosophically,\nat why this would be the sirtuins only,\nlike to come on or get\nactivated when the body needs,\nis on the right adversity.\nAnd if a cell is surrounded by\nfat or contains a lot of fat,\nit's going to think times a good,\nit doesn't need to switch on.\nSo that's the evolutionary argument.\nMechanistically, we don't know,\nbut it could have something to do with\nthe response to glucose,\nwhich then responds to the sirtuin gene,\nbut that hasn't been worked out very well.\n- And is there any evidence that leptin,\nthis hormone from fat can actually,\ninteract with the sirtuin pathway?\n- I don't recall seeing that-\n- Maybe I could do a\nsabbatical in your lab\nand that'd be a fun one.\n- Definitely-\n- Because leptin during\ndevelopment is what triggers,\nthe permission for the hypothalamus\nto enter puberty, right?\n- Yeah.\n- This is why kids that eat\na lot when they're young\nand get overweight will also start to go\nand undergo puberty more quickly,\nalthough they have\nreproductive issues later.\n- Well yeah.\nWe should study the\nhypothalamus together 'cause,\nthe hypothalamus is,\ncan control the aging of the body.\n- The most interesting part of the brain.\n[Andrew chuckles]\n- For sure.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- If you turn on the SIRT1 gene,\nthe SIRT2 that we work\non, in the hypothalamus\nthat actually, will extend lifespan.\nAlso, it's been shown by Dongsheng Cai\nat Albert Einstein College of Medicine,\nthat if you, inhibit\ninflammation in the hypothalamus,\nin a mouse, it will increase\nor maintain the expression\nof what's called GnRH,\nwhich is the hormone that,\nhe found actually controls\nlongevity in the mouse in part.\nAnd so keeping inflammation\ndown in the hypothalamus,\nis sufficient to extend\nthe life span of animals.\nAnd I reviewed that paper for nature\nall about seven years ago.\nAnd that was the first demonstration\nthat the hypothalamus is one\nof the leading regulators\nof the body's age.\n- I find this fascinating GnRH,\nfor those of you that don't\nknow actually comes from neurons\nin the hypothalamus that then,\nliterally reached down into the pituitary\nand trigger the release of\nall the things that control\nfertility, luteinizing hormone,\nfollicle-stimulating hormone, et cetera.\nIt's such a powerful set of neurons,\nand it's never really been clear,\nwhat at a behavioral level\ntriggers the release of GnRH.\nThere's all the stories about pheromones\nand timers and puberty, et cetera,\nbut environmental conditions\nand dietary conditions\nand behaviors that can\ncontrol GnRH release, I think,\nis an incredible area for exploration.\nI'd love to do that sabbatical by the way.\nI have a couple, well\nseemingly random questions,\nbut I can't help, but ask\nbecause one thing I like to do\nis forage the internet for\npractices that at least more than\na few people are doing,\nand then wonder whether or\nnot there's any basis for it.\nYou mentioned methylation\nas a detrimental process,\nthe way it disrupts the\nepigenome and the CD reader,\nso to speak.\nThere are people out there who\nare ingesting methylene blue.\nAnd when I was a kid,\nI used methylene blue\nto clean my fish tank.\nAnd I love fish tanks.\nI know you're into aquaria also,\na different podcast episode,\nwe'll talk about aquaria,\nbut why in the world, would\npeople ingest methylene blue?\nMeaning is their logic correct?\nAnd or is that a dangerous practice?\nI'm not sure I'd want to\ningest methylene blue,\nsounds not like a bad thing to do.\n- It stains your body if you've\nseen, yeah methylene blue-\n- Yeah, there was someone\nin my lab as a postdoc\nwas using it to study a\ncompletely different process\nrelated to the blood-brain barrier\nand used to inject into animals\nand they would turn blue,\nbut then again, people\ningest colloid silver.\nYou know they'll put\nin there, there's this,\nplease people don't do this\nor if you do, just don't tell me,\n'cause I won't like it.\nThey, people put it in their eyes\nand some people actually stain their skin.\nThey actually become kind of\na silver purple brown color\nif they do it excessively.\nI mean, there's a lot of\ncrazy stuff out there.\nBut what do you think they're thinking\nwith this methylene blue thing\nor should we just get them\nto a good psychiatrist?\n- I don't know, for sure.\nI think methylene blue was found\nto extend the lifespan\nof some lower organism\nand that's where it came from.\nMy recollection-\n- With the emphasis on lower organisms.\n- Yes smaller organisms.\nI think doesn't, do you\nremember Andrew does it,\ninterrupt or interfere\nwith mitochondrial activity\nand that's-\n- Maybe that's why the are doing it.\n- Yeah.\n- [Andrew] Okay.\n- We need to look this up and post it.\n- [Andrew] Okay.\n- We'll get to the bottom\nof this, but those methods,\nlet's talk about those.\n- [Andrew] Yeah.\n- Those methods have to\nbe placed on the right,\npart of the genome.\nThey get attached to the right\ngenes in the wrong genes.\nAnd if you have a lot of methylation,\nit's going to mess up the epigenome.\nSmoking will do that, lack of\nexercise, all that good stuff.\nSo you, what you actually want\nto do is you want to measure it\nand make sure what you're\ndoing with your body,\nis working.\nHow do you know that if you do this\nor that is actually helping.\nAnd so you can test your age.\nI could take, a swab from your mouth\nand tell you how old you are biologically.\nAnd then we could work on\ntrying to bring that down\nand actually there were anecdotes now,\nthat people are reversing\ntheir age by a decade or more\njust by doing some of the\nthings that we've talked about\nand some other cutting edge stuff\nthat I'm going to write about.\nBut yet, but you have to measure stuff.\nThat's, I didn't want to\nforget to bring that up.\nI'm measuring stuff all the time.\nI have blood tests like you,\nI've got this monitor that\nstuck to my chest right now\nthat's measuring myself\na thousand times a second\nand I measure my biological age.\n- What's it measuring a\nthousand times a second?\nA huge list of things.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo this, this little device is stuck here\nand it's for two weeks\nthat you just recharge it\nor send it back and get a new one.\nIt's got a body temperature movement,\nheart rate variability.\nIt's an FDA approved\ndevice, it's not a toy.\nIt's not one of these recreational things.\nIt also listens to my voice,\neventually will me if\nI need a psychiatrist\nor if I'm depressed,\nit will tell me how I sleep, obviously.\nBut when you put all that data together\nand it's individualized and anonymized,\nit can now tell my doctor in real time,\nif I've got a cold that\nneeds an antibiotic,\nor it's just a virus.\nIf I am suffering from COVID-19\nor even if I'm going to have\na heart attack next week.\nAnd so these little devices\nare going to be with us\nall the time, instead of going\nto your doctor once a year,\nwhich is ludicrous.\n- I have to ask you about x-rays.\n'Cause every time I go through\nthe scanner at the airport,\nI think, \"Sinclair would never do this.\"\nAnd the argument I heard\nyou give about this before\nwas a really excellent one, which is that\nit's a low level amount of radiation,\ngoing through at the airport,\nbut the argument is always,\nwell, it's just as much as on the plane\nand your argument, your\ncounter-argument I should say was,\n\"Well then why would I\nwant to do both, right?\nWhy would?\"\nSo when you go to the airport,\nassuming you're not running late\nand you have to go\nthrough the standard line,\nwhat do you say to them?\nAnd do you say, \"I'm David Sinclair.\"\nAnd then they shuttle\nyou to your own line.\nWhat do you say?\nYou do say, \"I don't like this thing.\"\nDo you have to give them a reason?\n- No, you don't.\nYou can say, \"I don't want this.\"\nAnd they'll get annoyed\n'cause it's hard for them\nto pat you down,\nbut you get a pat down and you you're done\nas long as you're not\nin a hurry, it's fine.\nIf you want to pay for\nthe TSA Pre in America\nor the way to get around those\nscanners, you can do that.\nSo I travel a lot, so\nit's worth it anyway,\nbut I just go through the metal detector,\nI don't get scanned.\n- And the metal detector\ndoesn't have the same,\nsame problem.\nAnd what about x-rays at the dentist?\nYeah.\n- Well, you know one x-ray\nis not going to kill you.\nTwo's not going to kill you, but I-\n- Three will kill you.\nNo, I'm just kidding.\n[Andrew chuckles]\n- I try to limit it\nbecause it's cumulative.\n- Right.\n- And I went for six years\nwithout having a dental x-ray\nand then my last visit, I just gave up.\nI was tired of arguing with my dentist.\nSo they gave me one,\nbut they've got led coats on\nand they put lead all over your body.\nThat's telling you something right there.\nAnd funnily enough, my\nteeth hadn't changed.\nNow you can balance that by saying,\n\"Well, one x-ray, two x-ray,\nthree x-rays is worth\nit if I have cavities.\"\nAnd that's true,\nyou want to know what's in there,\nbut doing it regularly, for me,\nI don't think it was worth it because it,\nmy teeth are in perfect\nhealth and I've always been,\nI don't have any cavities,\ndidn't have braces,\nthey're fine.\nSo stop scanning me.\nI mean, I know you have\nto pay for the machine,\nbut you know, do I have a choice?\nYes, so stop pressuring me.\n- You know, who shared your\nsentiments about x-rays\nand the dentist in general?\nMy apologies to the dentists out there,\nwas the great physicist, Richard Feynman.\nThis is a story about him that's\nnot especially well-known,\nbut he had very serious\nconcerns, health concerns,\nabout x-rays because he\nunderstood the physics\nand he understood enough biology that,\nhe was actually quite vocal about his,\ndislike of dental\ntechnology and its dangers.\nAnd he talked about some of that.\nPeople can find that on\nthe internet, if they like.\nSpeaking of people who,\nare like Feynman,\nwho've been engaged in public\ndiscourse about science.\nOne of the things that I\nappreciate about you, in fact,\nthe way that you and I,\ninitially came to know one\nanother is through your\npublic health education efforts.\nSo, obviously we're doing this podcast,\nyou've done the Joe Rogan Podcast,\nLex Fridman's Podcast, excuse me Lex,\nI'm still adjusting that.\nLex Fridman's Podcast\nand many other podcasts,\nyou've written an amazing book.\nWhat are you thinking these days\nin terms of what the\nworld needs in terms of,\neducation from scientists,\neducation from MDs,\neducation in general as it\nrelates to these things because,\nI think if nothing else\n2020 revealed to us that\nthere's a gap,\nthere's a gap in understanding.\nAnd that the scientists too are guilty of,\nnot knowing what to do\nwith all the information\nthat's out there on pub med or elsewhere.\nI'm just, you know,\nwhat are you thinking for\nyourself and in general,\nI'd like to just know,\nwhat do you think the world needs there?\nMaybe we can recruit some\nmore public educators.\n- Yeah.\nWell, we've gone from a\ntime, when you and I were,\nin college and young\nprofessors where the only way,\nto get our voice out to\nthe public was either\nthrough a newspaper or a\nvery short radio interview,\nwhich for me was extremely\nfrustrating 'cause particularly\nthe newspapers and my topic,\nevery time was twisted into something that\nwas not just embarrassing,\nbut Harvard university\nused to bring me into the back office and-\n- Frankenstein.\n- \"How did you say such a thing?\nWe're all going to live to a 250.\"\nI didn't say that.\nSo, we're now also in a world where\nwe're overwhelmed with information,\nand most of it is wrong\nand anyone can pretend to be an expert.\nSo we've gone from early\ndays to now the future,\nand we're experiencing it right now\nthanks to guys like you, people like you,\nis that the experts, some experts,\na small number who are\nbrilliant and good communicators\nare talking directly to the public.\nThis has never been able to be possible,\nuntil this time, right now.\nSo another five years from\nnow, and certainly by 10 years,\nI would hope that there are\ntrusted sources of information\nof people who can not just\ncommunicate, the ideas directly,\nbut are able to talk about\nthings that are going on that\naren't even published yet to say,\n\"Here's what's really going on.\nAnd this is what the future looks like.\"\nBut this is somebody, like yourself\nwho spent their whole life\nstudying a particular topic\nand knows what they're talking about.\nAnd this,\nthis is also something\nthat I think most people\ndon't know that we\nscientists, if we tell a lie,\nwe burst into flames,\nwe absolutely cannot tell\nsomething, that's untrue.\nAnd to the best of our\nknowledge, we say it as it is,\nbecause if we don't, we're beaten up,\nand we, or we kicked\nout of the university.\nSo the people who survive to our age,\nand I'm a little older than you.\nSo I've survived a bit longer.\n- But a lot younger inside.\n[Andrew chuckles]\n- Nah, but we have to measure you with-\n- Yeah we need,\nI probably need a little\nhelp, hopefully not too much.\n- We'll measure that,\nand we'll work on your\neating, but this is really,\nreally important is that,\nfinally people like your are\nallowed by our universities\nto talk to the public.\nI used to do it,\nwith a real threat to my survival.\nPeople would look at me,\n\"Oh, he's a salesman, he's\npromoting this and that.\"\nIt was seen as a real\nnegative, but finally,\nI think we're in a world where,\nit's not negative anymore.\nAnd the pandemic showed that\nwe needed voices of reason,\nvoices of fact, that you could trust.\nAnd you can see the\npopularity of your podcast,\nshows that the public,\nthey're desperate for\nfacts that they can trust,\n'cause they don't know\nwhat to believe anymore.\n- Well,\nI'm being completely honest\nwhen I say this, that,\nyou know, I followed your lead.\nI saw you on the Joe Rogan\nPodcast and my jaw dropped.\nI was like, \"This is amazing, like this.\"\nBecause,\nyou get out other good\nscientists on before but,\nyou're tenure Professor Harvard Genetics,\nDepartment of Genetics.\nAnd for those of you don't know,\nthere's the Harvard and of\ncourse, Harvard Medical School\nand they're both excellent, of course,\nbut these are the top,\ntop tiers of academia.\nAnd I certainly understand\nwhat it takes to get there\nand survive there and to thrive there,\nit's like a game of pinball.\nYou never win.\nYou just, you just get to,\nif you're doing really well,\nyou get to keep playing.\nAnd that's the truth in academia.\nAnd if you're not, you\nstop playing basically.\nBut when I saw you,\nexplain what you were doing\nin a way that was accessible to people\nand also talking about,\npossible protocols that they\nmight explore for themselves\nto see if those were, right for them.\nI was just, I was just\ndazzled and excited,\nand I made every effort to\nget in contact with you.\nAnd, the rest is history,\nbut, I think what's really\nexciting to me these days is\nbecause of 2020 and with\neverything that's happened\nand it continues to happen.\nThere's a thirst for knowledge.\nThere's also this direct\nto the public route\nthat you mentioned.\nAnd, I think there's also an openness,\nI'd love your thoughts on this,\nbut it seems to me that\nthere's an openness in,\nfrom the general public,\nabout health practices,\nthat there are actually things\nthat people can do to control\ntheir stress level, to control,\ntheir sleep, to control their cholesterol\nif that's what they to\ndo, maybe they don't\nand to even control their lifespan,\nwhich I think is remarkable.\nAnd, I know I speak on\nbehalf of so many people,\nwhen I just,\nI want to say, thank you.\nYou've, truly changed\nthe course of my life.\nI would not be sitting here doing this\nwere it not for your example.\nAnd I always say Sinclair,\nmany people have written books,\nmany academics have\nwritten books, as you have,\nbut in terms of doing podcasts\nand really getting out there\nwith your message in a way that\nI have to assume raised\nyour cortisol level\nand heart rate just a little bit,\nbut you did it nonetheless.\nYou are truly first man in and that,\nthat deserves a nod.\nAnd, I have a great debt of\ngratitude to you for that.\nSo thank you so much.\n- Oh thanks, Andrew.\nYou're a,\nyou've become a good friend\nand I'm super proud of what\nyou've done and what you,\nI know what you will do.\n- So in addition to your book\nand your presence on social\nmedia, Instagram, and Twitter,\nand appearances on podcasts,\nrecently I've noticed\nthat you've opened up,\na survey email/website\nthat people can, access,\nexcuse me,\nto get some information\nabout their own health\nand rates of aging.\nTell us about that and\nwhat's being measured.\nAnd what is this test that\nyou've been working on,\nsecretly and now soon, not so secretly.\n- Yeah, well that,\nwhat I want,\nis a credit score for\nthe body to make it easy\nfor people to follow their health.\nAnd there is a number,\nthere's a,\nthere's a biological age\nthat you can measure.\nUnfortunately,\nthe test is many hundreds\nof dollars right now,\nbut in my lab, we've been\nable to bring that down a lot.\nAnd so I want to democratize this test\nso that everybody has access to a score\nfor their health that can predict their,\nnot just their future\nhealth and time of death,\nbut to change it.\nAnd I'm building a system\nthat will point people\nin the right direction\nand give them discounts for certain things\nthat will improve, not\njust their health now,\nbut 10, 20, 30 years into the future.\nAnd we can measure that,\nand very cheaply, keep\nmeasuring it to know\nthat you're on the right track,\n'cause if you don't measure something,\nyou can't optimize it.\nAnd so this is the biological age test,\nwe've developed it, it's\na simple mouth swab.\nWe're rolling it out.\nWe're building the system right now.\nAnd there was a sign up sheet\n'cause a lot of people\nwant to get in line,\ngo to doctorsinclair.com,\nyou can get on that\nand you'll be one of the\nfirst people in the world\nto get this test and see what we're doing.\n- Oh, fantastic.\nWill people be celebrating their,\nbiological age birthdays?\nIn other words, if I'm\nminus, like if I can imagine,\nso I'm 45 right now, soon to be 46.\nBut if I,\nif I were to be so lucky as\nto get my biological age to 35\nwithin 12 months, maybe\nyou can help me do that.\nDo I get to celebrate,\na negative birthday?\n- Absolutely.\nAnd my plan is that those\npeople who take their age back\na year or more, we think we can\ngo back 20 years eventually,\nthey'll get a birthday card from me\nand it's a negative birthday card.\n[Andrew chuckles]\n- I love it.\nAnd probably very little,\nactual birthday cake being ingested but,\nwho cares 'cause you're\nliving that much longer.\n- That's full of stevia,* that'll be fine.\n[Both chuckle]\nAnd thank you for talking to us today.\nI realized I took us down deep\ninto the guts of mechanism\nand as well, talking\nabout global protocols,\neverything from what one can\ndo and take if they choose,\nthat's right for them to,\nhow to think about this\nwhole process that,\nthat we talk about when\nwe talk about lifespan\nas always an incredibly illuminating.\nThank you, David.\n- Thanks Andrew.\n- Thank you for joining\nme for my conversation\nwith Dr David Sinclair.\nIf you're enjoying and or\nlearning from this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nIn addition, please subscribe\non Apple and or Spotify.\nAnd on YouTube, you can

Instagram.\nIt's hubermanlab on Instagram.\nI also have a Twitter\nwhich has also hubermanlab.\nSo be sure to check those out.\nA lot of the material,\ncovers things similar to the podcast,\nbut oftentimes I'll\ncover a unique material,\nnot featured at all on the podcast.\nSo that's hubermanlab on\nInstagram and on Twitter.\nIn addition, we have a Patreon,\nit's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.\nAnd there you can support the podcast\nat any level that you like.\nToday, and in many other\nprevious episodes of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwe discuss supplements.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary or right for everybody,\nmany people derive tremendous\nbenefit from supplements.\nFor that reason, we partnered with Thorne,\nT-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne Supplements\nare the absolute highest quality\nand the absolute highest precision,\nmeaning what you see listed on the bottle\nis what's actually in the bottle,\nwhich is not the case\nfor many supplement companies out there.\nThorne is one of the\npartners of the Mayo Clinic\nand all the major sports teams.\nAnd so they really are very\ntrusted, very highest quality.\nIf you want to see the supplements\nthat I personally take,\nyou can go to thorne.com/u/huberman,\nand there you'll see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can get 20% off any\nof those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site,\nthrough that portal,\nyou'll also get 20% off any\nof the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nSo again, it's Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman\nto get 20% off any of the\nsupplements that Thorne makes.\nAlso take note that the\nlifespan podcast featuring\nDr David Sinclair as a host,\nlaunches Wednesday, January 5th,\nyou can find the first episode here\non the Huberman Lab Podcast channel.\nThey also have their\nown independent channel.\nYou can find the link to that\nchannel in the show notes.\nSo please go there, subscribe on YouTube,\nalso on Apple and Spotify.\nI've seen these episodes,\nthey are phenomenal,\nand you're going to learn\na tremendous amount,\nabout aging and how to\nslow and reverse aging\nfrom the world expert\nhimself, Dr David Sinclair.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
