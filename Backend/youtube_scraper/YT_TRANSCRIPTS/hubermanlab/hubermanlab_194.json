    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday's episode is about the biology,\npsychology and practices\nof social bonding.\nFrom the day we are born\nuntil the day we die,\nthe quality of our social bonds\ndictates much of our quality of life.\nIt should therefore be no\nsurprise that our brain,\nand indeed much of our\nentire nervous system\nis wired for social bonds.\nNow social bonds occur\nbetween infant and parent,\nthere even particular wiring\ndiagrams within the brain\nand spinal cord and body\nthat are oriented towards\nthe specific bonds\nthat occur between infant and mother,\nas well as infant and father.\nAnd we have specific brain\ncircuitries for friendship,\nspecific brain circuitries\nthat are activated\nin romantic relationships.\nAnd as it goes, specific brain circuitries\nthat are activated when we\nbreak up with a romantic partner\nor when they break up with us,\nor when somebody passes away, moves away,\nor otherwise leaves our\nlives in one form or another.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about those brain\nand nervous system circuitries,\nwe're also going to talk\nabout the neurochemicals\nand hormones that underlie their function.\nAnd we are going to touch\non a number of important\nand actionable tools that you\ncan apply in everyday life.\nAnd because we are\nheaded into the holiday,\nthe New Year and Christmas holiday,\nthat you can deploy in\nyour various interactions\nwith family members and friends.\nAnd should you not be spending time\nwith family members and friends,\ntoday, we are also going to talk about\nhow to achieve social bonds\nout of the context of family\nand romantic partnership and friendship.\nSo today's episode is going\nto include a lot of science,\na lot of actionable tools,\nand I'm confident that you will come away\nfrom today's episode\nwith tremendous knowledge\nabout how you function.\nFor instance, if you're an\nintrovert or an extrovert,\nwhy is that?\nTurns out there may be a\nneurochemical basis for that.\nMaybe you're somebody that\nreally enjoys social media,\nmaybe you're somebody that doesn't.\nToday I'm going to talk about\na gene or a set of genes\nthat predicts whether or not\nyou will follow more people\nor seek out more online,\nsocial interactions or fewer.\nBelieve it or not, there's\nbiology around that now,\nand it's excellent peer reviewed work.\nWe will also talk about\nhow bonds are broken,\nand why breakups can be so painful,\nnot just romantic breakups,\nbut breakups with\nfriendships and coworkers,\nand how to move through\nthose more seamlessly.\nSo regardless of your age,\nand regardless of whether or not\nyou are in a romantic partnership\nof one form or another, or not,\nI do believe this episode\nwill be useful to you\nas you explore the social bonds\nthat already exist in your life,\nand as you seek out new\nand changing social bonds.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the biology\nof the visual system,\nand the visual system has\nmany important features\nthat allow us, for instance,\nto see things with crystal clarity,\neven if it's brightly lit or dimly lit,\nor there are changing\nbrightness in our environment.\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nare designed with the biology\nof the visual system in mind.\nSo when you wear them,\nyou don't have to take them\noff and put them back on\nlike you would with other types\nof sunglasses and eyeglasses,\nand you're always going to see\nthings with crystal clarity.\nIn addition, they're very lightweight,\nso usually forget that\nyou're wearing them.\nI certainly forget when I'm wearing mine.\nI wear readers at night and when I drive,\nand I wear sunglasses\noften throughout the day.\nThe other thing that's really great\nabout Roka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that you can wear them doing anything.\nYou can wear them while\nrunning, while cycling,\nif you get sweaty, they\nwon't fall off your face.\nBut unlike a lot of other\nperformance eyeglasses out there,\nthey have a terrific aesthetic\nthat you could also wear to\nwork, to school, out to dinner,\nthey basically can be\nworn anywhere, anytime.\nIf you'd like to try Roka,\neyeglasses and sunglasses,\nyou can go to Roka that's R-O-K-A.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nAgain, that's Roka, R-O-K-A.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nat checkout to get 20% off.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012,\nand I've taken it ever since.\nSo I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason that I\nstill take Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day,\nis because it covers all\nof my vitamin mineral\nprobiotic foundational needs.\nThere's now a wealth of\nevidence pointing to the fact\nthat vitamins minerals and probiotics\nsupport healthy gut microbiome,\nhealthy immune system,\nhealthy nervous system,\nhealthy endocrine system,\nthat's the hormone system.\nAnd with Athletic Greens,\nit really covers all those bases.\nIn fact, when people ask me\nwhat one supplement they should take,\nI recommend Athletic Greens.\nIf you like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey're giving five free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy to\nmix up the Athletic Greens\nwhile on the road, in the\ncar, on the plane, et cetera,\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.\nThere is now a lot of evidence\nsupporting that Vitamin D3\nis great for our metabolism\nendocrine system,\nmood sleep, a huge number\nof biological functions.\nAnd K2 has also been shown to be important\nfor cardiovascular health\nand various aspects of blood lipids.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou can claim a special offer,\nyou'll get your Athletic Greens,\nfive free travel packs of Athletic Greens,\nplus a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app\nsupported by 25 published studies\nand has over 600,000 five-star reviews.\nI've been meditating for a very long time,\nmore than three decades,\nbut I confess I haven't\nbeen a consistent meditator\nuntil recently.\nI think many people will\nhave that experience,\nwe've all heard about the terrific science\nand benefits of a regular\nmeditation practice.\nThings like reduced\nanxiety, improved sleep,\nsharper cognition, and focus.\nHowever, sticking to a meditation\npractice can be tricky,\nand many people start and then they stop.\nOr at least that's what happened to me\nuntil a few years ago,\nwhen I started using the\nHeadspace app to do my meditation.\nHeadspace has short meditations\nof just a couple minutes long,\nlonger meditations.\nIdeally for me, I like to\ndo a 20-minute meditation\nat least three times a week,\nbut sometimes because of my schedule\nand other things going on,\nI only sneak in a five-minute meditation\nonce or twice a week.\nWith Headspace, you have a huge number\nof meditations to select from.\nSo if you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a completely\nfree one-month trial\nwith all of Headspace's meditation.\nThat's the full library of meditations\nthat Headspace has to offer.\nThat's the best deal offer\nby Headspace right now.\nSo again, if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/special offer today.\nLet's talk about the\nbiology of social bonding.\nAnd I want to point out\nthat I used the word\nbonding intentionally.\nIt's a verb.\nAnd in biology, we want\nto think about verbs\nbecause everything in\nbiology is a process,\nit's not an event.\nAnd when we think about things\nin biology as a process,\nthat means it's going\nto have multiple steps.\nAnd today we are going\nto explore the steps,\nstart to finish of social bonding.\nMeaning how social bonds are established,\nhow they are maintained,\nhow they are broken and\nhow they are reestablished.\nNow an important feature\nof biology generally,\nbut in particular, as it\nrelates to social bonding,\nis that the neural circuits\nmeaning the brain areas\nand neurons and the hormones,\nthings like oxytocin,\nwhich we'll talk about today,\nand the other chemicals\nin the brain and body\nthat are responsible for the\nprocess we call social bonding\nare not unique to particular social bonds,\nthey are generic.\nWhat I mean by that is that\nthe same brain circuits\nthat are responsible\nfor establishing a bond\nbetween parent and child\nare actually repurposed\nin romantic relationships.\nAnd this might not come as\na surprise to many of you,\nmany of you are probably\nfamiliar with this idea\nof securely attached people\nversus anxious attached people\nversus avoidant attached people.\nWe're going to touch on that a little bit,\nbut all of that has roots\nin whether or not children\nand parents formed healthy social bonds,\nor whether or not they had\nchallenged social bonds.\nNow it's clear from the scientific\nand psychological literature\nthat just because you might have had\na not so great or even terrible\nsocial bond with a parent\nor with some other caretaker\nor loved one as a child,\nthat doesn't fate you to have\npoor social bonds as an adult,\nthere's a lot of plasticity in the system,\nmeaning it can change,\nit can rewire in response to experience.\nAnd as we will soon discover,\nthere specific components\nwithin the neural circuits of your brain\nthat are responsible for social bonding\nthat allow you to place subjective labels\non why you are doing certain things\nand to rewire the neural\ncircuits for social bonding.\nSo we're going to touch\non all of that today.\nBut the important feature\nreally to point out\nis that we don't have\n12 different circuits\nin the brain and body for\ndifferent types of social bonds,\nwe have one,\nand there's some universal features\nthat underlie all forms of social bonds.\nSo we're going to start by exploring\nwhat those neural circuits are,\nand then we're going to see how they plug\ninto different types of social bonds.\nAnd then we're going to explore\nthings like introversion, extroversion,\nwhere we're going to touch on a little bit\nabout things like trauma\nbonds, healthy bonds,\nand various other aspects\nof how humans can bond to one another.\nAnd as you'll soon discover,\nthere is a unique chemical signature\nof all bonding of all kinds.\nAnd you're going to learn how to modulate\nthat chemical signature.\nBefore we talk about social bonding,\nI want to talk about it's mirror image,\nwhich is lack of social\nbonding or social isolation.\nNow for better, for worse,\nthere is a tremendous\nliterature on the biology\nof social isolation,\nand all of the terrible things that happen\nwhen animals or humans\nare socially isolated\nat particular phases of life.\nNow, for those of you that are introverts,\nyou are not necessarily damaging yourself\nby deciding to spend less\ntime with other people.\nMany people like time alone,\nI personally am an introvert,\nI get a thrill out of spending time\nwith one or two close friends,\nbut I enjoy a lot of time by myself.\nI like to socialize,\nso I wouldn't call myself\nan extreme introvert,\nbut I know there's some\nextreme introverts out there.\nBut when we talk about social isolation,\nwhat we're referring to is when animals\nor humans are restricted\nfrom having the social contacts\nthat they would prefer to have.\nAnd to just briefly touch\non the major takeaways\nfrom this literature,\nwhich spans back a hundred years or more,\nbeing socially isolated is stressful.\nAnd one of the hallmark\nfeatures of social isolation\nis chronically elevated stress hormones,\nlike adrenaline also called epinephrin,\nlike cortisol, a stress\nhormone that at healthy levels\nis good for combating inflammation,\nhelps us have energy early in the day,\nfocused throughout the day.\nBut if cortisol is elevated for too long,\nwhich is the consequence\nof social isolation,\nthe immune system suffers\nand other chemicals start to be released\nin the brain and body\nthat are designed to\nmotivate the organism,\nanimal or human to seek out social bonds.\nAn example of one such chemical\nis a peptide called tachykinin.\nTachykinin is present in\nflies, in mice and in humans,\nand under conditions of social isolation,\nit's levels go up,\nand because of the brain areas\nthat contain receptors for tachykinin,\npeople start feeling very\naggressive and irritable\nafter social isolation.\nNow that should be a little\nbit counterintuitive to you,\nyou would think, oh,\nyou know, if you isolate\nan animal or a human,\nand then you give them the opportunity\nfor social interaction, they\nshould behave very well,\nthey should be thrilled,\nthey're finally getting the nourishment,\nthe social nourishment\nthat they've been lacking for so long.\nIt turns out that's not the case.\nChronic social isolation\nchanges the nature of the brain and body\nsuch that it makes\nsocial connection harder,\nand it makes the person who's\nbeen isolated, irritable,\neven aggressive with other people.\nNow, I don't want to go too deeply\ninto the biology of social isolation,\nbecause it doesn't actually\nafford us that much insight\ninto what healthy social\nbonding looks like.\nSo today we're going to focus\nmore on the functional biology,\na dual meaning of the word functional,\nas opposed to the pathology\nof social isolation.\nHowever, I do want to point out\nthat social isolation\nstarts to deteriorate\ncertain aspects of brain\nand body pretty quickly,\nbut how quickly depends again\non how introverted or\nextroverted somebody is.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho is socially isolated\nfor the holidays,\nor has been socially isolated\nfor a period of time,\nand is craving social contact,\nthat is a healthy craving.\nAnd as we'll learn next,\nthe healthy craving for social contact\nhas a very specific brain circuit,\nhas a very specific\nneurochemical signature\nassociated with it,\nand has some remarkable\nfeatures that you can leverage\nin social contacts of all kinds.\nI think some of the more\nimportant and exciting work\non social bonding comes from\nthe laboratory of Kay Tye.\nKay is a professor at the Salk Institute\nfor Biological Studies,\nshe's an investigator\nwith the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\nAnd in recent years,\nI would say in about the\nlast five or six years,\nher laboratory has made\na fundamental discovery\nas to why we seek out\nand put so much effort\ninto social bonds.\nAnd the key discovery that she made\nis that much like hunger,\nmuch like temperature,\nmuch like thirst, we have brain circuits\nthat are devoted to what's\ncalled a social homeostasis.\nMany of you have probably\nheard about homeostasis before,\nhomeostasis is the characteristic\nof various biological circuits\nand even individual cells\nto try and maintain a certain level.\nIt's most easily thought of\nin the context of hunger,\nif you don't eat for a while,\nyour drive to pursue\nfood and think about food\nand make food and spend money on food,\nand indeed to enjoy food goes up.\nWhereas when you're well fed,\nyou don't tend to seek out food\nwith as much vigor or as much intensity,\nyou wouldn't invest as much\ntime, effort, money, et cetera.\nSo homeostasis is the\naspect of cells, tissues,\nand organisms to seek some sort of balance\nto regulate themselves.\nIn a crude way, you can\nthink about the thermostat\non your home as a homeostatic circuit.\nWhen the temperature goes up a little bit,\nit cools things down to\nmaintain a certain temperature.\nWhen the room gets cold,\nit hits a certain level\nand a sensor detects that,\nit clicks on and then the heat goes on\nto maintain a certain set temperature.\nSo that's a simple way of\nthinking about homeostasis.\nEvery homeostatic circuit\nhas three components,\nor at least three,\none is a detector, meaning the organism\nor the thermostat on your wall\nhas to have some way of detecting\nwhat's going on in the environment,\nall right, in the context\nof social bonding,\nwhether or not you are\ninteracting with others\nand whether or not those\ninteractions are going well.\nSo that has to be detected,\nthat's the first thing.\nThen there has to be a control center,\nthat's the second thing.\nAnd the control center is the\none that makes the adjustments\nto, in the case of social bonding,\nto your behavior and to your psychology.\nSo you'll soon learn that\nthere are ways in which\nthe more time that you spend alone,\nthe more motivated you are to seek out\nthe pictures of faces, the\ninteractions with actual people,\nphysical contact, and so forth.\nNow that might seem obvious to you,\nbut thanks to the work\nof Kay Tye and others,\nit's remarkable to learn\nthat there are specific brain centers\nthat are adjusting our\npsychology and biology\nso that we seek out\nbonds more aggressively,\nor maybe we don't because\nwe are perfectly sated\nor satiated with respect\nto how much contact\nwe've had with other people.\nNow, the third component\nof this homeostatic circuit\nis the effector.\nThe effector is actually what drives\nthe behavioral response,\nit's what leads you to\npick up your social media\nand start scrolling,\nit's what leads you to text a friend,\nit's what leads you to\ncall a friend or make plans\nand what leads you to follow\nthrough on those plans.\nSo again, those three\ncomponents are a detector,\na control center, and an effector.\nAnd as you'll soon learn,\nthe neural circuit that\ncontrols the social homeostasis\nactually has a fourth component,\nand that fourth component is one\nthat places subjective understanding\nas to why you are doing\nwhat you are doing,\nand establishes your place in a hierarchy.\nNow, I know the word\nhierarchy can be a little bit\nof a barbed wire one\nbecause people immediately\nstart thinking about boss and subordinate,\nor in couples, a leader and a follower.\nBut when we talk about social hierarchies\nin the context of human interactions,\nsocial hierarchies are very plastic,\nmeaning in one setting, one\nperson can be the leader,\nin another setting, the other\nperson can be the leader.\nYou probably have groups of\nfriends or family members\nwhere you're constantly passing the baton\nas to who's going to drive,\nwho's going to navigate,\nwho's going to pick the restaurant,\nwho's going to clear the dishes\nand who's going to do certain\nactivities and not others.\nSo hierarchies are very dynamic.\nAnd as a consequence, social\nhas to be very plastic\nand very fluid so that you move\nfrom one environment to the next,\neven with the same people,\nyou have to be able to\nmake those adjustments.\nAnd in the case of the\nsocial homeostasis circuit,\nthose adjustments are made by\na particular brain structure,\nI've talked about on this podcast before,\nit's called the prefrontal cortex,\nit is the seat of our higher\nconsciousness, if you will.\nIt's what allows us to play\nsubjective labels on things\nso we are not strictly input\noutput, we're not robotic.\nMeaning if you go to dinner with a friend\nand they are exceptional\nat choosing restaurants,\nwell, in the context of the\nsocial homeostasis circuit,\nyour prefrontal cortex would allow them\nto pick the restaurant\nbecause basically they\nare dominant over you\nin their capacity to\npick good restaurants,\nat least in this example.\nWhereas as you leave that restaurant\nand perhaps you are navigating\nto a where to get a drink after dinner,\nor where to walk through the city,\nperhaps you have the\nbetter sense of direction.\nAnd so then the social\nbonding has to be maintained\nas you switch the hierarchy, okay?\nSo that's the role of that fourth element,\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nNow I just briefly want to\ntouch on some of the brain areas\nthat thanks to the work\nof Kay Tye and others,\nwe now know underlie the\ndetection, control and response.\nOkay, I call them the detector,\ncontrol center and effector\nbecause inside of that description,\nisn't just a bunch of\nnames of neural structures,\nthere are also hints as\nto what the underlying\nneurochemicals are,\nand by understanding what\nthe neurochemicals are,\nyou can start to think\nabout tools that you can use\nto form social bonds and\nmaintain social bonds\nin better, healthier ways.\nSo let's talk about the detector first.\nNow, keep in mind that\nyou have your senses,\nyou have your vision, you have\nyour hearing, you have touch,\nyou have smell, you have taste.\nSensation as I've talked about many times\nbefore in the podcast,\nbut I'll just remind you,\nsensation is the conversion\nof physical stimuli in the environment\ninto electrical and chemical signals\nin your nervous system.\nThe language of the nervous system\nis electrical and chemical signals.\nSo photons of light are\nconverted to electrical\nand chemical signals,\npressure on the skin or\nlight touch on the skin\nis converted into electrical\nand chemical signals\nand so on and so forth.\nSo all of that of course is\nflowing into the nervous system,\nbut the detector that\nunderlies social homeostasis\ninvolves mainly two structures,\none is called the ACC, the\nanterior cingulate cortex,\nand the other is the BLA,\nbasal lateral amygdala.\nAnd when you hear the word amygdala,\nyou're probably thinking fear.\nBut today, as you'll see,\nthe amygdala actually has many different\nsub compartments and components.\nAnd there's a reason why\nthe basal lateral amygdala,\nwhich is associated with certain aspects\nof aversive behaviors,\nmeaning moving away from certain types\nof things or interactions,\nthere's a reason why the\nBLA is such an integral part\nof the detector system,\nand that's because just as it's important\nto form healthy social bonds,\nit's vitally important to try and avoid\nunhealthy social bonds.\nAnd so the basolateral\namygdala is mainly associated\nwith these aversive type responses\nof just moving away from certain things.\nThe control center in the\nsocial homeostasis circuit\ninvolves a brain area called\nthe lateral hypothalamus\nand the periventricular hypothalamus.\nThe lateral hypothalamus\nand the periventricular hypothalamus\ncontain neurons that are able\nto access the hormone system\nin order to influence the\nrelease of things like oxytocin,\nwhich is a hormone neuropeptide,\nit's got a part hormone,\npart neurotransmitter,\nit's kind of a hybrid,\nwe're going to talk a\nlot about oxytocin today.\nSo we've got the ACC and the BLA,\nthese are their areas are mainly involved\nin moving away from things,\nalthough also toward them,\nthat's the detector.\nThen we got the control center,\nwhich is in the hypothalamus,\nand then there's a very\nspecial and important area\nassociated with social bonding\nthat I want everyone to learn,\nwhich is the dorsal raphe nucleus or DRN,\ndorsal raphe nucleus.\nThe dorsal raphe nucleus\nis a small collection\nof neurons in the midbrain,\nso it's deep in the brain.\nAnd most of the time when\nyou hear about raphe,\nR-A-P-H-E, by the way, raphe nucleus,\nyou're talking about serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neuromodulator\nthat is often associated\nwith feelings of satiety\nafter eating, warmth,\nbasically satisfaction with\nthings that you already have.\nHowever, within this dorsal raphe nucleus,\nthere is a small subset of\nneurons that release dopamine.\nDopamine is a neuromodulator\nmost often associated with movement,\ncraving, motivation and desire.\nAnd the neural circuits\nthat are rich with dopamine\nare things like the substantia nigra,\nthe mesolimbic dopamine system, the VTA,\nthe nucleus accumbens, et cetera.\nThose names don't have\nto mean anything to you.\nHowever, this unique\npopulation of dopamine neurons\nin the raphe is truly unique\nin that it's responsible for mediating\nwhat I've been calling social homeostasis.\nIt is the effector or the response\nthat mediate social homeostasis.\nNow I haven't told you exactly\nwhat social homeostasis is.\nSocial homeostasis, just like hunger,\nis the process by which when\nyou lack social interaction,\nyou start to crave it.\nWhat's very interesting about the fact\nthat there are dopamine\nneurons in this raphe structure\nthat is the effector\nfor social homeostasis,\nwhat this means is that\nwhen you are not interacting\nwith people at a frequency or intensity,\nthat is right for you,\ndopamine is released into the brain.\nIn most popular\nconversations about dopamine,\nand even in scientific circles,\nwhen you hear dopamine release,\nyou think about reward or feeling good,\nbecause indeed many behaviors\nand drugs of abuse increase dopamine.\nThat's one of the reasons they have\nso much addictive potential.\nHowever, dopamine is not\nassociated with feeling good,\nit is actually the neurochemical\nthat's responsible for movement\ntoward things that feel good.\nSo to zoom out and\nconceptualize what we have here,\nwe have a brain area that is a detector\nthat either will move us toward or away\nfrom certain types of\nexperiences or sensations.\nWe have a control center\nthat is going to release\ncertain hormones and neuropeptides\ninto our brain and blood,\ndepending on the sorts of interactions\nthat we happen to be having.\nAnd we have this response system,\nwhich is the dorsal raphe nucleus\nthat contains dopamine neurons.\nAnd when we are not\ninteracting with people\nat the frequency or\nintensity that we crave,\ndopamine is released,\nand that dopamine causes us to seek out\nsocial interactions of particular kinds.\nSo let's talk about what\nsocial homeostasis is\nand how it plays out.\nAnd again, let's use hunger as an example.\nSo let's say you're a person who eats\nevery three or four hours regularly.\nSo on Monday, Tuesday,\nWednesday, Thursday,\nyou're just accustomed to eating\nevery three or four hours.\nIf just suddenly I steal your meal\nout of the fridge at work,\nsomething I would not do,\nbut just for sake of\nmental experimentation,\nthat would probably cause you to go\nand seek out food\nthrough some other route.\nYou might buy food,\nyou probably be upset first,\nbut then you go buy\nfood or replace the food\nthat you were going to eat,\nyou'd be hungry for that food.\nAnd indeed there are\nhormonal type mechanisms\nand other mechanisms that\nwhen we eat regularly\nand we predict that food is coming in,\nwe actually start secreting insulin,\nwhich is for mobilizing blood sugar,\nthere are hormones in the bloodstream\nthat make us hungry on a\nregular clock-like schedule,\nand you would seek out more food.\nSimilarly, if you're\nsomebody who is accustomed\nto a lot of social interaction,\nand suddenly I take away\nthat social interaction,\nyou would feel kind of let down,\nyou would crave a replacement\nsocial interaction.\nYou might be upset that you\nhad a lunch date with a friend,\nyou're used to having lunch\nwith them every Wednesday,\nand they cancel and you\nwould crave the interaction.\nOkay, this is called a pro-social craving.\nAnd indeed, this is what you\nsee in animals and humans.\nIf you, what's called\nacutely isolate them,\nwhich is just a fancy scientific word\nof saying deprive them\nof social interactions\nin a short-term basis,\nthey start engaging in\npro-social behaviors,\nthey start texting other people,\nthey start seeking out social interactions\nof different kinds.\nAnd that makes perfect sense, right?\nBut thought of from the different side,\nyou could also imagine\nhow well, if you're getting\na social interaction\nwith somebody on a daily or weekly basis,\nand suddenly you remove that interaction,\nwell, then people might not care,\nthey might just think,\nwell, I'll get the interaction tomorrow\nor the next day or the next day,\nbecause they're sated,\nmuch in the same way that the person\nwho eats very regularly might say,\n\"Well, I ate four hours ago,\nand I'll eat eight hours\nlater, no big deal.\"\nBut that's not what happens.\nThere's a prediction\nthat we are going to have\ncertain types of interactions,\nand when those interactions don't happen,\nwe replace that lack of\ninteraction with a drive\nand a motivation to seek\nout social interaction.\nAnd that drive and\nmotivation is caused by,\nor I should say,\nis driven by dopamine release\nfrom that dorsal raphe.\nAnd so the takeaway is that\nwhen we lack social interaction\nthat we expect, we become pro-social.\nHowever, if we are\nchronically socially isolated,\nmeaning we don't have interactions\nwith people for a long time,\nwe become actually more introverted.\nThis is separate from all\nof the tachykinin stuff\nthat I talked about earlier,\nor falling into states of chronic stress,\nbut it's well-established now\nthat in humans and in animals,\nif you don't give them\nenough social interaction,\nthey actually become antisocial.\nAnd so this is actually a little bit\nlike what one might see\nwith long-term fasting.\nOkay, I gave the example\nof eating every four hours,\nnow let's give the parallel\nexample of somebody\nwho's been fasting perhaps\nfor two or three days,\nif they are expecting to eat,\nand then the meal doesn't arrive,\nthey are not necessarily\ngoing to immediately\ntry and seek out food.\nAnd that's a little bit counterintuitive,\nyou would have thought,\nwell, they haven't eaten\nin a very long time,\nthey're going to be very\nmotivated to seek out food,\nbut no, they are accustomed to fasting.\nSimilarly, the social homeostasis circuit\nworks in a way such\nthat when we don't have\nsocial interactions for a very long time,\nwe start to lose our craving\nfor social interactions.\nLet's look at the social\nhomeostasis circuit\nthrough the lens of what's commonly\ncalled introversion and extroversion.\nNow, typically when we\nhear about introverts,\nwe think about the quiet\nperson at the party,\nor the person that doesn't\nwant to go out at all.\nAnd we think about an\nextrovert as somebody\nwho's really social, the\nso-called social butterfly,\nwho enjoys social\ninteractions, is really chatty,\nis kind of life of the party type person.\nThat's the cliche or the kind\nof pop psychology cliche,\nbut actually in the psychology literature,\nthat's not really the way it holds up.\nMany people who appear introverted\nare actually extroverted.\nThe quiet person at a party\ncould be an extrovert,\nexcept that they just\ndon't talk very much.\nThe characteristic of an extrovert\nis somebody that gets energy\nor feels good from social interactions,\nthey sort of get a lift,\nand we can predict that that lift occurs\nbecause of some release of dopamine\nwithin their brain and body.\nAnd indeed there's evidence for that,\nneuroimaging study support that,\nother forms of neuro-biological analysis\nsupport that as well.\nWe can also imagine that the person\nwho's talking a lot is somebody\nwho's very extroverted,\nbut oftentimes people who\ntalk a lot for their work\nor they're somebody who's very social\nwhen you interact with them,\nthat person gets back to their car\nand is absolutely depleted and\nexhausted by that interaction\nor all sorts of social interactions.\nSo we really can't predict\nwhether or not somebody\nis an introvert or an extrovert\nsimply based on their behavior,\nit's really more of an\ninternal subjective label.\nHowever, if we look at\nintroversion and extroversion\nthrough this lens of the\nsocial homeostatic set point,\nand we think about\ndopamine as this molecule\nthat drives motivation to\nseek out social interactions,\nwhat we can reasonably assume\nis that introverts are\npeople that when they engage\nin certain forms of social interaction,\neither the amount of\ndopamine that's released\nis greater than it is an extrovert,\nthat's right, I said greater\nthan it is at an extrovert,\nand so they actually feel quite motivated,\nbut also satisfied by very brief,\nor we could say sort of\nsparse social interactions.\nThey don't need a lot of social\nengagement to feel sated.\nAgain, the parallel\nexample would be hunger.\nThis would be somebody who\ndoesn't need to eat much\nin order to feel satisfied.\nWhereas the extrovert,\nwe can reasonably assume\nreleases less dopamine\nin response to an individual\nsocial interaction.\nAnd so they need much\nmore social interaction\nin order to feel filled\nup by that interaction.\nAnd indeed this is supported\nby the neuro-biological imaging studies.\nSo rather than thinking about\nintroverts and extroverts\nas chatty versus quiet,\nit's useful to think about\npeople, maybe yourself,\nmaybe other people you know,\nas how much social interaction they need\nin order to bring this social\nhomeostasis into balance.\nNow there's the fourth component\nof this social homeostasis\ncircuit that I mentioned before,\nand that's the prefrontal cortex.\nThe prefrontal cortex\nis involved in thinking\nand planning and action,\nand has extensive connections\nwith areas of the brain\nlike the hypothalamus,\nwhich is responsible for\na lot of motivated drives.\nIt also has connections with the various\nreward centers of the brain,\nand it can act as kind of an accelerator,\nmeaning it can encourage\nmore electrical activity\nof other brain centers,\nor as a break on those brain centers.\nA really good example,\nit's kind of a trivial one\nin the context of today's discussion,\nbut it's a concrete one so I'll use it,\nit would be, I know many people\nout there use cold showers\nas a way to stimulate metabolism\nand build up resilience\nand this sort of thing.\nIf you get into a very cold shower\nand you feel as if you want to get out,\nbut you force yourself to stay in,\nyou're forcing yourself to stay in\nbecause your prefrontal cortex\nis placing some subjective\nlabel on that experience.\nEither you're doing it\nfor a certain benefit\nor you've got a timer,\nand you're using the\ntimer as the regulator\nof how long you're going to stay in,\nbasically your overriding reflexes.\nAnd that's the main function\nof the prefrontal cortex.\nBut as I mentioned earlier,\nthe prefrontal cortex components\nthat wire into the social\nhomeostasis circuit\nare responsible for evaluating\nwhere you are in a given hierarchy.\nAnd that affords you a ton of flexibility\nin terms of the types\nof social interactions\nthat you can engage in,\nand whether or not you're\ngoing to spend time\nwith certain people or not,\nwhether or not you're going\nto engage and then disengage.\nWhat do I mean by this?\nWell, let's say you're\nan extroverted person,\nyou're somebody that likes\na lot of social interaction\nand you get a lot of\ndopamine release on whole\nfrom a lot of social interactions.\nSo maybe one interaction with\na teller at the supermarket,\nisn't really going to\ngive you much dopamine,\nbut going to a party will\ngive you more dopamine,\nand so you seek out these\nlarger social interactions.\nHowever, you might go to a party\nwhere somebody says something\nor you see somebody there that\nyou'd much prefer not to see,\nand therefore you decide to leave.\nThe deciding to leave is regulated\nby that prefrontal cortex component.\nSo it's important to understand\nthat just because there's\na homeostatic circuit\nthat involves areas like the amygdala\nand the hypothalamus and\nthese deep brain regions,\nlike the dorsal raphe,\nas a human being,\nyou have flexibility over\nyour social interactions\nand that flexibility arise\nfrom those prefrontal circuits.\nSo there's a ton of\nsubjective nature to it,\nthere's a lot of context to it.\nSo while there are some predictable\nelements of these circuits,\nthey are not simply what we\nwould call, plug and chug,\nyou have flexibility,\nyou are able to say, \"You\nknow, I love parties,\nbut I really don't want\nto go to that party\nbecause so-and-so is there.\"\nOr, \"I very much don't like\ngoing across town in traffic,\nbut I'm going to do it today\nbecause a certain collection of people,\nor perhaps a certain individual\nwill be at that particular party.\"\nAnd so the prefrontal cortex again,\nis what allows you that subjective ruling\nor ruling over what would\notherwise just be reflexes.\nSo now I'd like to drill\na little bit deeper\ninto this incredible neural structure\nthat is the dorsal raphe nucleus\nand this small collection of neurons,\nthe dopamine neurons of the dorsal raphe\nbecause while it's a small collection,\nthey are very powerful.\nLoneliness has been defined\nby the great psychologist, John Cacioppo,\nas the distress that\nresults from discrepancies\nbetween ideal and perceive\nsocial relationships.\nLet me repeat that.\nLoneliness is not just being isolated,\nloneliness, as he defines it,\nis the distress that\nresults from discrepancies\nbetween ideal and perceive\nsocial relationships.\nIt's when we expect things to be one way,\nand they're actually another way\nand which way we expect them to be\nand which way they turn out,\nagain, is highly subjective.\nWhat you expect from friendships,\nand what other people\nexpect from friendships\ncould be entirely different,\nbut the circuit that\nunderlies friendship bonding\nis exactly the same.\nAnd it is this dorsal raphe nucleus\nand the dopamine neurons in that nucleus\nthat underlie the bond\nthat is social friendship\nand all types of social bonds.\nThere's a key finding in the literature,\nthe title of this paper is Dorsal Raphe\nDopamine Neurons Represent the Experience\nof Social Isolation.\nThis is a paper from Kat Tye's lab,\nthe first author is Matthews,\nGillian Matthews to be specific.\nWhat they did is they were\nable to selectively activate\nthe dopamine neurons in\nthe dorsal raphe nucleus.\nAnd when they did that,\nthey induced a loneliness-like state.\nNow, how did they know it\nwas a loneliness-like state?\nThey knew because it motivated\nthe seeking out of social connections.\nThis is the kind of social hunger\nthat I was referring to before.\nWhereas when the dopamine\nneurons of the dorsal raphe\nare inhibited, meaning\ntheir activity is quieted\nthat suppressed a loneliness state.\nSo that's a little\ncounterintuitive, right?\nIt's a group of neurons\nthat when activated\nmakes you feel lonely,\nand when this brain area is not activated,\nit suppresses loneliness.\nBut if you think about it,\nthat's exactly the kind of\ncircuit that you would want\nin order to drive social behavior.\nWhen you're feeling lonely,\ndopamine is released and\nit causes you to go out\nand seek social interactions.\nWhen this brain area has\nenough social interactions,\nthat's sort of a figure of speech,\nbrain areas don't have\nenough social interactions,\nbut when enough social\ninteractions have happened,\nthat the neurons in this brain areas\nshut down their production of dopamine.\nWell, the loneliness state turns off.\nSo what we think of as loneliness\nas this big kind of dark cloud,\nor, you know, fog in our\npsychological landscape,\nboils down to a very small set of neurons,\nreleasing a specific\nneurochemical for motivation.\nAnd to me, this really changes the way\nthat we think about loneliness\nand that we think about\nsocial interactions.\nThere's so much subjective\nlandscape to loneliness\nand to social interactions,\nbut at the end of the day,\nwhat it really is is that\nwe are all social animals\nto some extent or another,\nand we all crave social interactions\nto some extent or another,\nalthough the extent will vary\ndepending on where you are\nin the introversion\nextroversion continuum.\nAnd it is indeed a continuum.\nNow, the other aspect of the\nstudy that was really important\ngets back to that issue of\nhierarchy and social rank.\nWhat they found is that depending\non where you see yourself\nin the social rank,\nthe dopamine neurons in the raphe\nwill lead to one consequence or another,\nmeaning moving toward social interactions\nor moving away from them.\nSo the whole system is set up\nso that you have a ton of flexibility\nand control over social interactions.\nSo just a couple of key points\nand actionable takeaways\nbased on the information\nI've offered up until now,\nif you think of yourself as an introvert,\nit's very likely that\nyou get a lot of dopamine\nfrom a few or minimal social interactions.\nWhereas if you're an extrovert,\ncontrary to what you might think,\nsocial interactions are not going to flood\nyour system with dopamine,\nthey actually are going to\nlead to less dopamine release\nthan it would for an introvert,\nand therefore you're going to need\na lot more social interactions\nin order to feel filled\nup by those interactions.\nNow I've been drawing a lot of parallels\nbetween this social seeking\nor avoiding social isolation and hunger,\nbut is that really the case?\nAnd could it be that they're\nactually interactions\nbetween the different drives?\nMeaning could social isolation\nor the desire to seek\nout social interactions\nactually relate to the\nhunger system and vice versa?\nAnd indeed the answer is yes.\nWe don't have 50 different\nhomeostatic systems\nand 50 different neurochemicals\nto underlie our drive,\nto eat our drive for\nromantic interactions,\nour drive for friendship interactions,\nwe have essentially one, maybe two,\nand they all funnel into\nthe same dopamine system.\nAnd there's a beautiful\npaper that illustrates\nsome of the crossover\nbetween these different\nhomeostatic drives.\nThe title of the paper\nis Acute Social Isolation\nEvokes Midbrain Craving\nResponses Similar to Hunger.\nThis from Rebecca Saxe's lab at MIT,\nMassachusetts Institute of technology,\nDr. Kay Tye is also an\nauthor on this paper,\nthe paper was published\nin Nature Neuroscience.\nIt's a really terrific paper.\nJust to briefly summarize what they did,\nthey took people that were categorized\nas socially connected\nhealthy human adults.\nSo these are people that are used\nto pretty frequent social interactions,\nand they socially isolated\nthem for about 10 hours.\nAnd they had no opportunity\nto access social media,\nemail, fiction reading even,\nand certainly didn't have the opportunity\nto interact with people face to face.\nSo what this did is it\nincreased social craving,\nboth subjectively the people said\nthat they were now craving\nsocial interactions,\nand then they did brain imaging\nin response to images of people,\npeople interacting, food, flowers,\nother types of stimuli,\nsome of the stimuli or these images\nthat we call them stimuli\nbut their images really, had\na lot of social engagement\ngoing on in them, others did not,\nsome had a lot of faces\nshowing, others did not.\nAnd as you might suspect,\nthere was activation of\nmany of the brain areas\nthat we've talked about earlier,\ndorsal raphe nucleus and other brain areas\nassociated with dopaminergic neurons.\nWhen the socially isolated\npeople viewed social cues,\npeople interacting, faces,\nand so on and less so\nfor things like flowers,\nhowever, they also had increased responses\nto images of food, which is interesting\nand actually is consistent\nwith the literature\nthat when people are socially isolated,\nthey often will start eating more,\nor they will change the nature\nof the foods that they eat.\nNow we think of that as comfort foods\nor soothing oneself through eating\nrather than social interaction\nas a kind of pathology,\nbut while it might not be healthy,\ndepending on the context and the person,\nit's really important to understand\nthat the reason that happens\nis because we have a common circuit\nand that the system meaning the person\nis actually craving dopamine release.\nThey don't consciously know this,\nthis is all subconsciously carried out,\nbut they're craving dopamine release.\nAnd if they can't get it\nfrom social interactions,\nas they normally would, they'll\nstart seeking it from food.\nNow they did an important\nreverse experiment as well,\nwhere they had subjects go\non 10 hours of food fasting.\nNow these were not people that\nwere familiar with fasting,\nthey weren't doing intermittent fasting,\nthey were eating more\ntypical meal schedules,\nand so that created\nincreased hunger, et cetera,\nbut it also increased\ntheir appetite if you will,\nfor social interactions.\nAnd so the important point here\nis that there's a common biology,\nthere's a common circuitry\nthat underlies homeostatic\ncraving of things that\nmaintain us as individuals\nand as a species.\nAnd it really places social\ninteractions as right up there\nin the list of things that\nwe could consider so vital\nfor our survival and for our health.\nThings like food, water,\nsocial interactions\nreally sit within a top\ntier amongst each other,\nand they use the same common circuitry,\ndorsal raphe dopamine neurons,\nin addition to other structures,\nin order to create this drive,\nto seek out certain types of stimuli.\nNow, this is a very reductionist\nview of social bonding,\nI realized that,\nbut it's important to realize\nthat while we place all\nthe subjective context,\noh, I miss this person,\nor I really would like\nto avoid that person,\nat the end of the day,\nit really all funnels into a system\nwhereby a single neurochemical\nis either being released and motivating us\nto seek out more of a\nparticular type of interaction\nor is not released,\nand therefore we are perfectly comfortable\nstaying exactly where we are.\nAs I say this, some of\nyou are probably thinking,\n\"Oh, that's probably what\nhappens when you fall in love.\"\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nWhen people enter romantic relationships,\nthat to them are very satisfying,\nthere's this period that, you know,\nthat the theory is that it lasts anywhere\nfrom six days to six months,\nalthough some people\nreport that this feeling\ncan last many, many years,\neven decades of just feeling\ncompletely filled up and sated\nby the experience of\nbeing with that person.\nSo much so that cravings\nfor food are reduced,\ncravings for sleep are reduced.\nNow there's all sorts of activities\nand things that go along with\nnew romantic partnerships\nthat take up time, that might\nget in the way of things\nlike sleep or things like food.\nBut the point is that dopamine\nis the final common pathway\nby which we seek out things\nand we end up feeling\nas if we are satisfied\nby certain types of interactions.\nNow, similarly, if\nyou've ever been isolated\nfor a long period of time,\nyour focus might have shifted\nto what you're going to eat,\nwhat you're going to cook for dinner\nin a much more heightened way,\nthe importance of those sensory stimuli\nand those types of interactions,\nand indeed the taste\nof food itself expands.\nSo normally when we are\nin social relationships\nthat are ones that are familiar to us,\nwe have a balance of\nthese different drives.\nBut when one particular drive takes over\nand we are very focused on it,\nbecause they all funnel\ninto the same circuitry,\nthere really isn't the seeking out\nof certain types of behaviors\nlike food seeking when\nwe're newly in love.\nNow that doesn't mean that\nfood won't taste good to us\nso that we don't seek it.\nAnd indeed, there are\nexperiments that have been done\nwhere if people have just fallen in love,\nthe taste of a strawberry\ncan just be incredible.\nThe other effect of\ndopamine is that it changes\nthe way that we interpret sensory stimuli,\nour detectors actually change\nwhen we are in heightened states\nof dopaminergic activity or drive.\nBasically what this means\nis that things seem better\nthan they would when we have\nless dopamine in our system.\nThe point here is that\nthere's a lot of crossover,\nthere's a lot of meshing together\nof different homeostatic drives\nthat they don't exist\nin separate channels.\nAnd it's only under conditions\nin which one particular homeostatic drive\nis kind of being played\nout to the extreme,\nsuch as the example of falling in love,\nthat we tend to avoid or sort of overlook\nthe other homeostatic drives,\nand that's because simply\nwe're getting enough dopamine,\nwe don't need anymore.\nUp until now, I've been focused\non the organizational\nlogic of social bonding,\nwhich is really just nerd speak\nfor how is it that we\nform bonds, avoid bonds?\nWhy do people seek out more or fewer bonds\nthan others, et cetera?\nNow I'd like to shift gears a bit,\nand focus on what are\nsome things that we can do\nto encourage the formation\nof healthy bonds?\nThere's a beautiful\nstudy that was published\nin Cell Reports, Cell Press\nJournal, excellent journal.\nThe title of this paper\nis Conscious Processing\nof Narrative Stimuli\nSynchronizes Heart Rate\nBetween Individuals.\nI mentioned this on a previous podcast,\nbut I'd like to mention it again\nand go into a little bit more depth\nbecause it points to specific\nactionable items that we can all use\nin order to enhance the quality and depth\nof social bonds of all kinds.\nNow this study involved a very\nsimple type of experiment,\nthey had people listen to a story,\neverybody in the study\nlistened to the same story,\nbut they listened to that\nstory at different times\nand indeed in different locations.\nSo different people, same story.\nAnd they measured things like heart rate,\nthey measured breathing, et cetera.\nNow, what was the\nmotivation for doing this?\nWell, there's a long standing literature\nshowing that our physiology,\nthings like our heart rate, our breathing,\nour skin conductance,\nmeaning the amount of sweating,\ncan be synchronized between individuals,\nand that synchronization can occur\naccording to a variety\nof different things.\nThere've been studies that\nhave people look at one another\nand they look and actually\nsee that their pupil size\nof their eyes starts to synchronize.\nPeople's breathing can synchronize,\npeople's body temperatures\ncan even start to synchronize,\nor at least shifts in body\ntemperature can synchronize.\nOne person gets cooler, the\nother person gets cooler.\nA lot of this is subconscious,\nsome of it can be\ndetected by conscious cues\nlike flushing of the skin,\nor actually seeing\nsomeone's pupils change.\nBut actually the pupil reflex\nis a really good example,\nwhereby except for rare cases\nand certain highly trained individuals,\nmost people can't control\ntheir pupil reflexes\nin a very deliberate way,\nit's truly a reflex,\nit's an autonomic reflex.\nSo there's a lot of literature showing\nthat within small groups or two people,\nthese physiological signals\ncan be synchronized.\nWhat this study found was\nthat when people listen\nto the same story, but at different times,\ntheir heart rates start to synchronize.\nThis is incredible because\npeople are listening\nto the story at different times,\nbut the gaps between their\nheartbeats become very stereotype\nand map almost precisely onto one another.\nThat's incredible.\nNow we also know from\nan extensive literature\nthat the quality and perceived\ndepth of a social bond\ncorrelates very strongly\nwith how much physiological\nsynchronization\nthere is between individuals.\nIn other words, when your\nbodies feel the same,\nyou tend to feel more\nbonded to somebody else.\nAnd so this whole thing is\na rather circular argument,\nwhen you feel closer to somebody else,\nyour physiology synchronize,\nand the reverse is true as well,\nwhen your physiologies are synchronized,\nyou feel closer to other people.\nThis is what I call\nthe concert phenomenon,\nif you ever go to see your favorite band,\nor you go to a concert\nthat you particularly love,\nyou often look over at somebody\nand you'll see them\nenjoying the same thing,\nand they're often in a\nsimilar state as you are,\nmaybe their sort of like\nfavorite song comes on,\nand you actually feel\nconnected to that person.\nYou feel like you're in...\nObviously there's a shared experience,\nbut there's also a shared\nphysiological response\nto that experience.\nAnd so this can happen and mass\nwith large groups of people,\nor it can happen just\nbetween two individuals.\nAnd as the study points out,\nit can actually happen\nbetween individuals,\nwithout them actually\ninteracting with one another.\nWhen the story they are listening to\nis the anchor or the\ndriver of their physiology.\nThis really points to\nthe fact that the body\nand the brain are reciprocally connected.\nYes, indeed, what we think, what we hear,\nwhat we feel drives our physiology,\nour heartbeat, our respiration, et cetera,\nbut our heartbeat and respiration also\nare influencing our state of mind.\nAnd in this case,\nit's encouraging certain\ntypes of social bonds\nwhen our heart rates are synchronized.\nAnd you can leverage this,\nhow can you leverage this?\nWell, let's take a upcoming\nexample of the holidays.\nThere's a sort of a joke,\nI think it was Ram Dass, sort\nof Buddhist philosopher type\nthat said, \"If you think\nyou're enlightened,\ngo visit your parents.\"\nAnd I think what he was referring to\nis that some people, not all people,\nhave challenging relationships\nwith their parents.\nWe're going to talk about\nchild-parent attachment\nand interactions in a few minutes,\nbut you know, some people\nhave a wonderful relationship\nto both their parents\nand more power to them,\nI think that's wonderful,\nwe should all be so lucky.\nMany people have challenged relationships\nwith their parents,\nor they have a great\nrelationship with their parents,\nbut their parents know,\nor they know how to drive that dart\nright into that particular soft\npiece of psychological flesh\nby saying just the slightest thing,\nor even by raising their\neyebrow or rolling their eyes\nor the tone in which they do something.\nThis is also true between siblings.\nI think many of you can think of examples\nwhere this is true.\nMany people when they\ninteract with others,\nexpect that the mere interaction\nwith the other person\nis going to create the sense of bonding.\nAnd often that is the case,\nfor instance, if are involved\nin intimate disclosure,\nif people enjoy each\nother's company so much\nthat just the mere sight of\nsomebody evokes great feelings\nand it's mutual, that often can happen.\nBut in many types of social interactions,\nit's not the direct\ninteraction with that person\nthat makes us feel close to them,\nbut rather it's shared experience.\nAnd shared experience\nis shared physiology.\nThat's the point I'm trying\nto make by way of this study\nabout conscious processing\nof narrative stimuli\nsynchronize this heart rate\nof different individuals.\nSo for instance, if you\nhave a somewhat challenged\nor somewhat, let's call\nit a slight friction\nin getting close with somebody,\nor it can be a challenging interaction,\noftentimes, it's very\nuseful to focus outward\non some other common narrative, a movie,\noftentimes people will\nwatch a game together.\nActually there's a lot of critique\nthat people or families will focus outward\ntoo much on external events,\nbut these external events can\nbe observing the grandchild\nand how wonderful they are,\nor observing the meal\nand how wonderful it is.\nOr as we commonly see\nin various traditions,\nthere's a story that's repeated each year,\ncertainly in the upcoming holidays,\nthere's Christmas stories,\nthere are themes and traditions,\nand those themes and traditions\nanchor a number of different\naspects of our psychology.\nThey're really wonderful,\nthey thread through the ages really,\nand allow us to link\nour own experiences up\nwith previous generations and experiences.\nBut in addition to that,\nthey synchronize our physiologies.\nAnd so sometimes it can be useful\nrather than expecting others\nto shift our physiology\nin the way that we wish,\nor us shifting their physiologies\nin the way that we wish,\nand then expecting some\nbond to mushroom out of that\nin some beautiful way,\nto focus on some external stimulus,\nto focus on something\nthat will synchronize\nthe physiologies of both people,\nthat can act as a bridge in\norder to establish social bonds.\nAnd this is not a hack or a workaround\nfor making terrible relationships good,\nthis is actually at the\nseat of what we come away\nfrom a social interaction with\nas feeling \"Wow, that was\na really wonderful time.\"\nOften a really wonderful\ntime can be by virtue\nof the specific things that were said,\nor the specific things\nthat one engaged in,\nbut more often than not\nthe final common pathway,\nwe should say,\nof great experiences was a\ngreat physiological experience\nand a shared physiological experience.\nI have a short anecdote\nthat relates to this,\nI have an older sibling\nand she used to say\nthat when she was in college,\nthe best dates that she ever went on\nwere dates where she was asked to go out\nand listen to music.\nShe pointed out, however,\nthat oftentimes the guys\nthat would ask her out\nwould take her to jazz clubs,\nshe always had the theory\nthat they would ask her to jazz clubs\nbecause at jazz clubs\ntypically you would sit down\nand then she had to conclude\nthat they couldn't dance.\nMy sister likes to dance.\nAnd so anytime someone\nactually had the nerve\nto take her dancing,\nthose turned out to be particularly,\nlet's just say, satisfying\ndates and relationships,\nat least they lasted longer,\nthat's all I know about them,\nthat's all I want to know about them,\nshe's my sister after all.\nBut the theory behind\nwhoever was asking her out\non these dates was it was the right one,\nwhich is that if you want\nto bond with somebody,\nyou create a common physiological response\nthrough a common and shared experience.\nAnd that is often a good entryway\ninto establishing whether or\nnot it's always a question,\nwhether or not there can be\ncommon physiological experience\nbetween two individuals.\nUp until now, we've been\ntalking about social bonding\nthrough the lens of neurocircuits\nthat are already established.\nHowever, early in the episode,\nI mentioned that these\nvery neural circuits\nthat are responsible for social bonding\nin adult forms of attachment,\nbe it romantic or friendship or otherwise\nare actually established\nduring development.\nOne of the more important,\nand I think exciting\nareas of early attachment\nas it relates to adult attachment,\ncomes to us from the work of Allan Schore.\nAlan shore, spelled\nA-L-L-A-N, Schore, S-C-H-O-R-E\nis a psychoanalyst who\nalso has deep understanding\nof neurobiology of attachment,\nboth in childhood and in adulthood.\nAnd he's focused a lot on differences\nbetween right brain and left\nbrain forms of attachment.\nNow in an early episode of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI touched into the fact that\nmost of what's discussed\nin the general public in\nsort of pop psychology\nand even in some neurobiology courses\nabout right brain versus left brain,\nand one side of the brain\nbeing more emotional,\nand the other side being more\nrational is completely wrong.\nOkay, most of what I see out\nthere is actually backwards\nto the way things actually work.\nAnd while there is some,\nwhat we call lateralization of function,\nmeaning certain brain functions\nare handled by neurons\non one side of the brain or the other,\nthe idea that one side of\nyour brain is emotional,\nand the other side of\nyour brain is rational\nis just simply not true.\nHowever, the work of Allan Schore\npoints to some very\nconcrete neural circuits\nthat do have a lateralization bias,\nmeaning they are more right\nbrain than left brain,\nor more left brain than right brain,\nthat underlies certain forms of attachment\nbetween child and parents,\nin particular child and mother,\nand that these right\nbrain-isms, if you will,\nand left brain-isms for attachment,\nget played out again and again\nin our forms of attachment as adults.\nSo I'd like to talk about\nthat work briefly now,\nbecause I think it\nreally points to a number\nof important features of\nhow we establish bonds\nand the different routes\nto establishing bonds.\nSo within the field of psychoanalysis,\nthere's been a longstanding\ndiscussion, of course,\nabout the so-called\nunconscious or subconscious,\nthe things that we are not aware of.\nAnd I think there's growing evidence\npointing to the fact that\nat least one major component\nof the subconscious or the unconscious\nis the so-called autonomic nervous system.\nThe autonomic nervous system\nis the portion of our nervous system\nthat controls our reflexive breathing,\nour heart rate, our skin conductance,\nmeaning our sweating, pupil size,\nit's the aspect of our nervous system\nthat makes us more alert or more calm.\nIt's the so-called sympathetic,\nmeaning for alertness,\nor parasympathetic branch of\nthe autonomic nervous system,\nparasympathetic for\nmore calming responses.\nNow what Dr. Schore's work\nand the work of others is now showing,\nis that early infant-parent,\nin particular infant-mother attachment\ninvolves a coordination or synchronization\nof these right brain circuits\nand these left brain circuits,\nas they relate, excuse me,\nto the autonomic nervous system.\nHow does this play out?\nWell, it plays out where\nearly on as an infant,\nwhen you're born, you're truly helpless,\nyou can't feed yourself,\nyou can't warm yourself,\nyou can't change yourself,\nand you certainly can't\nemulate walk anywhere\nto get the things that you need.\nAll of those functions,\nall of those needs rather are\nmet by your primary caretaker.\nTypically that's the mother.\nFathers of course play a role also,\nbut because of breastfeeding\nor even bottle feeding,\ntypically mothers play\na more prominent role.\nI realized there are exceptions,\nbut that's the general rule.\nThere are now brain imaging studies\nexamining the brains of infants\nand the brains of mothers as they interact\nand showing that the physical\ncontact between the two,\nthe breathing of the mother and child,\nthe heart rate of the mother and child,\nand indeed the pupil size\nof the mother and child\nare actually actively getting coordinated.\nIn other words, the mother is regulating\nthe infant's autonomic\nnervous system primarily,\nand the infant is also regulating\nthe mother's autonomic nervous system,\na small coup from a baby or a cry,\nwhich is a stress cry from a baby\nwill definitely regulate\nthe autonomic nervous system\nof the mother.\nThis whole right brain\nsystem is directly tapped\ninto the so-called oxytocin system,\nand we'll talk more about\noxytocin in a moment.\nOxytocin again, being this peptide hormone\nthat is involved in\nsocial bonds of all kinds,\nbut that at least in early childhood\nis very closely associated\nwith milk let down\nand milk production.\nThere's actually a lot of stimulation\nof oxytocin release in the\nmother by nursing itself,\nso physical contact with the nipple,\nand by the contact of skin\nbetween baby and mother\nand their specificity there,\nit's not just any baby that can evoke\nthe most amount of oxytocin\nrelease from the mother.\nNow, however, there are examples\nwhere just holding a child\nwill evoke oxytocin release\nin the non-parent or somebody\nother than the parent,\nI think most people experience that.\nThat's the new puppy\nor new baby phenomenon\n'cause indeed puppies can\ninvoke oxytocin release as well.\nThe point is not that\noxytocin is only released\nin response to the primary relationship,\nor the mother and their child,\nbut rather that the amount of oxytocin\nscales with how closely related one is\nto that particular child and vice versa.\nSo there's oxytocin release occurring\nin both the child and the mother.\nSo this right brain system is an emotional\nbut autonomic system,\nit is below our conscious detection.\nNow, as we get older,\nthere's another system that\nstarts to come into play\nin parent-child interactions,\nand this also comes into play\nin sibling interactions and so forth,\nand that's the left brain system\nas described by Allan Schore.\nNow, again, this isn't about\nemotion versus rationality,\nthis is about autonomic\nversus more conscious forms of bonding.\nSo on the left brain circuit side,\nthere is evidence for based\non neuroimaging studies,\nbut also animal studies\nto support the idea\nthat on the left brain side of things,\nthere is a processing more of narratives\nthat are very concrete,\nlogical narratives, okay.\nAnd again, I have to zoom out\nand just really tamped down the idea\nthat it's not that one side\nof the brain is emotional\nand the other side is rational,\nbut rather that these two things\nare happening in parallel.\nAnd that there's a bit of a dominance\nfor the left brain circuitry\nto be involved in the kinds of bonding\nthat are associated with\nprediction and reward.\nSo good example would be\nreading to a child every night,\nsitting there and reading,\nyou know, I can recall reading to my niece\nand seeing her parents read to her.\nAnd she had no clue whatsoever\nwith what they were saying\nbecause she, well, at least, I don't know,\nbut she certainly couldn't speak,\nbut she liked looking at the pictures,\nand it was a very predictable\nsort of interaction.\nIt was okay, out come the books,\nit was usually here's the bath,\nthen there's the pajamas,\nthen there's the lights go down,\nthen out comes the book,\nand then there's the interaction\nbetween parent and child,\nwhich of course usually also\ninvolves physical contact.\nSo it's not like the right brain system\nand the left brain system\nare operating separately,\nthey're operating in parallel.\nBut that sort of prediction and reward\nkids like to be read to,\nis generally mediated by\nthis left brain system.\nAnd this carries on as children get older\nand as parents take on and\nevolve their parenting roles.\nIt's very apparent that\nhealthy social bonding\nbetween children and caretaker\nrelies on the fact that\nboth this right brain system\nand the left brain system are engaged,\nthat there's a synchronization\nof autonomic function,\nmeaning a joining together\nin actual somatic feeling,\nand that there's a\nsynchronization of experience\nthat's more about some\noutward or external stimulus,\nlike reading a book or\nwatching a show together\nor enjoying some common\nexperience of a meal together.\nAnd of course, as children get older,\nthey're able to access\nmore and more cognitively\nsophisticated things.\nYou can watch a movie with them\nand they'll make predictions\nabout which characters\nare going to show up for instance,\nor you can take to a concert\nand they can appreciate the\nconcert or play in that concert,\nand they appreciate that\nthey're being appreciated.\nOkay, so there are a million different,\nthere's infinite number of examples here,\nbut the idea is that there\nare two parallel circuits\nthat are important for establishing bonds,\nand that this is set up\nvery early on in childhood.\nAnd that it's neither emotional\nnor rational, but both.\nNow both of these circuits\ntap into the circuitry\nthat we talked about earlier,\nwhere dopamine is released\nand molecules like serotonin,\nwhich again is a neuromodulator\nmore associated with\nfeelings of warmth, comfort,\nand satisfaction with our\nimmediate surroundings\nand possessions rather\nthan seeking of things\nand motivation and drive\nto go look for things,\nas is the case with dopamine.\nSo there's still interactions\nwith those systems,\nbut the work of Allan\nSchore has stimulated\na lot of interest in what are the circuits\nthat underlie this autonomic bonding,\nthis matching of heart rate and breathing,\nand what are the neural circuits\nthat underlie this bonding\nor this synchronization\nof experience on the\nkind of left brain side.\nAnd the reason I find\nthis model so attractive\nis that it's very clear that\nhealthy child-parent bonds\nare established, but\nnot by one or the other\nof these right brainer left\nbrain systems, but by both.\nAnd there isn't enough time\nto go into it right now,\nbut some of you are probably\nfamiliar with this idea\nof anxious attached\nversus avoidant attached\nversus there's a kind\nof dissociative attached\nmodel of infant parent\nbonding, just briefly.\nWhat's becoming clear\nfrom the neuro-biological\nimaging studies\nis that as people start to\nadvance into adolescence\nand adulthood and well\ninto their elderly years,\nthe same circuits that were active\nand established in childhood\nare repurposed for other\nforms of attachment.\nAnd that to have truly complete bonds\nwith other individuals,\nbut in particular with romantic partners,\nit's important that there\nbe both synchronization\nof physiology and\nsynchronization of these more,\nI guess we could call them more rational\nor predictive type circuits.\nSo we can leverage this information,\nwe can start to think\nabout what sorts of bonds\nto us feel very enriching\nand very complete.\nWe know that we can have,\nfor instance, an emotional\nconnection with somebody,\nbut we can also have a cognitive\nconnection with somebody.\nI have many colleagues with\nwhom I have deep intellectual\nconnection and convergence with.\nI won't say that I have\ndeep emotional connection\nwith most of them, a few of them, yes,\nbut most of them no.\nOthers in my life, for instance,\nI have a deep emotional connection to,\nbut not a lot of deep\ncognitive connection to.\nA good example would be the connection\nthat I had with my bulldog,\nwho unfortunately passed away.\nBut Costello, we had a very close,\nemotional connection, right?\nIt was based on touch, it\nwas based on our walks,\nit was based on fun,\nit was very autonomic.\nWe rarely discussed if\never what we were doing,\nwe had a felt relationship\nas opposed to a cognitive relationship.\nAnd while I'm sort of\nhalf kidding about that,\nas an example, it's a really good example,\nit was a very real bond.\nAnd in fact, just as a brief anecdote,\nI can remember when Costello was a puppy\nand I was entirely responsible\nfor his well-being,\nlike any parent of any infant,\nI lost my appetite for those few weeks\nwhen I was house training him\nand I seem to lose all ability\nto process any cognitive information.\nNow I was also sleep deprived,\nbut I was entirely focused\non the autonomic bond\nthat we were forming.\nAnd now, thankfully,\nthat eventually was\nestablished pretty quickly.\nBasically I went on to\njust basically feed him,\nwalk him and do everything for him,\nand we had a wonderful relationship.\nNow it's very clear that\nwhat we're talking about here\nis a form of empathy.\nEmpathy is the ability to feel,\nor at least think we\nfeel what others feel.\nBecause again, as my colleague\nand the great bioengineer\nand psychiatrist at Stanford,\nKarl Deisseroth has said,\nand he was a guest on this podcast.\nWe really don't know\nhow other people feel,\nwe just get the sense that\nperhaps we are feeling\nthe same thing\nor we're feeling something\ndifferent and we infer,\nor we project what they might be thinking.\nEmpathy is this sense that we are sensing\nwhat other people are sensing, okay.\nAnd there's no real way to verify that\nexcept if you're measuring physiologies,\nyou could get some insight into that.\nIn the clinical psychology\nand in the neuro-biological\nliterature now,\nit's understood that there\nis both emotional empathy,\nlike actually feeling\nwhat somebody is feeling\nand what is now called cognitive empathy.\nCognitive empathy is this idea\nthat we both see and experience something\nthe same way at a mental level,\nemotional empathy is this idea\nthat yes, I can feel what you feel\nat a visceral sematic or autonomic level.\nAnd it's absolutely clear\nthat strong social bonds\nbetween children and caretaker\ninvolve both emotional empathy,\nthis autonomic function\nand cognitive empathy,\nthat there's a mutual understanding\nof how the other person feels\nand how the other person thinks\nin order to be able to make predictions\nabout what they're going to do.\nIt's also very clear based\non the emerging literature,\nthat romantic relationships,\nand to some extent, friendships,\nalthough friendships have\nbeen explored a bit less\nin the literature,\nthat emotional empathy\nand cognitive empathy\nare both required in order to establish\nwhat we call a trusting social bond.\nAnd there's some\nbeautiful experiments done\nusing neuroimaging of two\nindividuals playing a trust game,\nessentially a game where\nyou're trying to predict\nthe other person's behavior,\nwhether or not they will\nbehave in a trustworthy way.\nAnd these experiments\ntend to use real money,\nso there's actually something at stake,\nand you can more or less predict\nwhether or not somebody feels\na lot of trust for somebody else\nand whether or not they believe\nthey will act in a trustworthy manner\nbased on whether or not\nthey have high levels\nof both cognitive empathy\nand emotional empathy.\nSo for those of you that are seeking\nto establish deeper bonds\nor bonds of any kind,\nit's important that you think\nabout synchronization of bodily states,\nwe talked about that earlier,\nand synchronization of cognitive states.\nNow that doesn't mean you\nhave to agree on everything.\nIn fact, oftentimes\npeople who feel very close\nto one another cognitively and emotionally\nargue about all sorts of things\nand disagree about a lot of things.\nIn fact, we probably know,\nI certainly know people and couples\nthat seem to bond through arguing,\nwhich is an interesting\nphenotype in itself.\nBut the point isn't that\nthere'd be total convergence\nof opinion or stance,\nbut rather that we understand\nhow the other feels\nand we believe that they\nunderstand how we feel,\nthat we understand how\nthe other person thinks\nand that they think that we\nunderstand how they think.\nSo it's a reciprocal\nloop between two people\nthat involves this cognition\nand involves emotion,\nand it's grounded as Dr.\nSchore has pointed out\nin our earliest forms of attachment.\nAnd that makes perfect sense\nbecause the same sorts of circuits\nthat are responsible\nfor social homeostasis,\nthe kind of right brain\nand left brain circuits\nthat are responsible for\ninfant-mother attachment,\nand then later for more intellectual\nor predictive type attachments\nbetween child and caregiver,\nare the exact same circuits\nthat we superimpose\ninto all other types of relationships\nthroughout the rest of our life.\nAnd I should just mention\nthat for those of you\nthat might be thinking that you\nhad a less than satisfactory\ninfant-caretaker interaction\nor form of attachment,\nyou are not alone.\nAnd in fact, much of the work\nthat Dr Schore focuses on\nis about how those early circumstances\ncan be understood and rewired\ntoward the development of\nhealthy adult attachment.\nAnd if you want to check out his work,\nhe's actually got a few\nYouTube videos out there,\nagain, it's Allan Schore,\nspelled S-C-H-O-R-E,\nI'd love to get him as\na guest on the podcast.\nHe also has a book it's called\n\"Right Brain Psychotherapy.\"\nAnd it's an excellent book,\nit's actually pretty accessible\neven if you don't have a background\nin biology or psychology,\nI found it to be very interesting,\nthere are a lot of excellent references.\nAnd again, if you're listening Dr. Schore\nor, you know, Allan Schore,\nwe'd love to get you on the podcast.\nOne of the key themes to understand\nabout biological processes\nis that they often work\non short timescales\nand longer timescales.\nAnd up until now, we've\nmainly been talking\nabout the stuff that\nhappens on short timescales.\nSo the kind of\nsynchronization of heart rate\nor activation of a given set of neurons\nthat dumps some dopamine\nand causes us to seek out\nmore social interaction\nor less for instance.\nBut every biological circuit and function\nneeds to have longstanding\neffects as well.\nAnd typically when you're thinking\nabout longstanding effects\nin the brain and body,\nyou start looking towards\nthe hormone system.\nIt's not always the case,\nbut more often than not\nneuro-transmitters and\nneuromodulators are pretty quick,\nwhereas hormones have\nlonger lasting effects.\nIn fact, a lot of hormones\ncan actually travel\nto the nucleus of a cell\nand actually change which\ngenes are expressed.\nSo if ever there was a hormone\nor hormone-like molecule\nthat's associated with social\nbonding, it's oxytocin,\nand oxytocin has gotten a ton of interest\nin the popular press.\nI don't know why that is,\nbut perhaps it's because of\nall the incredible things\nthat oxytocin is associated with.\nAnd it is indeed a lot of things.\nSo for instance, oxytocin\nis released in the brain\nand binds to receptors in\ndifferent locations in the body,\nand the moment you hear\ndifferent locations\nin the body receptors, you should think,\nwell, it's going to have\nlots of different effects.\nAnd indeed it does.\nOxytocin is involved in orgasm,\nit's involved in social recognition.\nThat's right, when you see people\nthat you consider your people,\nyour team, your group, your\nfriends, oxytocin is released.\nEven if you don't come into\nphysical contact with them.\nOxytocin is also associated\nwith pair bonding,\nthe feeling that they are your person,\nand that you are their person,\nis the common language people use.\nIt's also associated with honesty.\nBelieve it or not, there are experiments\nthat show that if people receive oxytocin\nthrough an inhalation spray,\nthat they will be more honest\nand forthcoming about certain things.\nAnd the oxytocin system and\nvariants in the oxytocin system\nhave also been associated with autism\nand various autism spectrum disorders.\nSo there's a huge range of behaviors\nthat's involved in\nbecause you have receptors\nfor oxytocin in lots of\ndifferent brain structures\nand areas of the body\nthat do different things.\nHowever, there's some very\nconsistent effects of oxytocin\nthat are worth just listing off,\nand then I'm going to talk\nabout two separate pathways\nby which oxytocin can\nmanifest its effects,\nand how you can actually regulate oxytocin\nin ways that are interesting\nand perhaps useful as well.\nFirst of all, oxytocin\nis involved in the milk,\nlet down reflex, lactation.\nThis makes perfect sense,\nthere needs to be a cue by which\nthe suckling on the nipple of the infant\ncauses the release or let down of milk,\nand milk let down and lactation\nis controlled by\nprolactin, another hormone,\nbut also oxytocin.\nOxytocin is also involved\nin uterine contraction\nduring childbirth,\nit's involved in cervical dilation\nto allow the baby to pass\nout of the birth canal.\nSo it's involved in induction\nof breastfeeding and of labor,\nwhich is remarkable and\nespecially remarkable\ngiven that in males or at\nleast in some male animals\nand in some male humans,\nand I do want to say some,\nand I'll get back to this,\nit can be involved in\nthe erection response,\nit can be involved in the orgasm response\nin both males and females.\nAlthough there there's a\nvery interesting difference.\nThere's a little bit of\ncontroversy about this,\nbut it does appear that in females,\nsexual and orgasm cause\nthe release of oxytocin,\nwhereas in males, sexual stimulation\ndoes not cause the release of oxytocin,\nbut rather a different\nmolecule vasopressin\nis triggered by sexual stimulation,\nbut orgasm does trigger the\nrelease of oxytocin in males,\nbut with a delay of about 30 minutes.\nWhy that is in the specific\nfunction of that is not clear,\nbut it does seem the oxytocin is involved\nin the sexual response in\nboth males and females.\nThe main types of interactions\nthat release oxytocin\nat high levels are first of all,\nthat the interaction between individuals\nthat see each other as very\nclosely associated, right?\nSo a infant and mother are\nvery closely associated\nwhether or not it's an\nadopted infant or not.\nOftentimes they are in close contact,\noftentimes they are from\nthe very body of the other.\nAnd so the amount or the\namplitude of oxytocin\nreleased tends to scale\nwith how closely\nassociated individuals are\njust the sight of one's\nbaby or smell of one's baby\ncan evoke oxytocin release and\nvice versa from the mother.\nPhysical contact, even more\nso in romantic partners.\nPhysical contact,\neven the sight of a picture of a partner\ncan evoke oxytocin release\nand sexual desire also trust.\nSo there's this whole\ncollection of psychological\nand physiological things that are packaged\ninto the oxytocin system.\nIt's not just a one way system.\nNow, a lot of people out there\nhave written to me asking\nabout inhaling oxytocin,\nasking whether or not\nthat can actually increase\nthe depth or rate of pair bonding.\nAnd there does seem to be\nsome evidence for that.\nNow, I think in most places,\noxytocin is prescription,\nalthough it might be\nover-the-counter and others,\nI don't know, you have\nto check where you are\nas far as I know you can't just go out\nand buy oxytocin nasal spray,\nalthough you may be able to,\nforgive me, I'm naive to that point.\nBut it's interesting\nto note that some drugs\nthat are being used in clinical trials\nfor things like trauma,\nand are also used in\nclinical therapeutic settings\nfor increasing bonding,\nin particular MDMA,\nalso called ecstasy,\nincrease dopamine and\nserotonin, we know this,\ndopamine and serotonin have\na vast number of effects\nthroughout the brain and body\nthat I've talked about some of them today\nand another podcast.\nBut one of the lesser\nappreciated effects of MDMA\nis that it causes huge increases,\nmassive increases in\nthe amount of oxytocin\nthat's released into the brain and body.\nAnd MDMA-assisted psychotherapy\nwhile still illegal,\nas far as I know,\ncertainly in the United States,\nbut in most places throughout the world,\nis being explored in clinical trials,\nnot just for trauma,\nnot just for depression, not\njust for eating disorders,\nbut also for reestablishing\nwhat seemed to be fractured\nor challenged bonds\nbetween romantic partners.\nAnd while most of the\nattention has been focused\non the dopaminergic and serotonergic\naspects of the MDMA response,\nit's clear to me, based on\nmy read of the literature,\nthat the enormously elevated oxytocin\nthat occurs during the consumption of MDMA\nis part of the reason why people\nexperience during the MDMA\nsession and post MDMA session,\na much greater degree and depth of kinship\nor feeling of connection with that person.\nAnd it's important to point out\nthat that feeling of connection\nis of the autonomic type\nthat I was referring to\nearlier, al Allan Schore's work.\nThat it's not of the,\noh, we think about things\nthe exact same way,\nwe agree on everything now,\nit's more of that their\nphysiologies are synchronized.\nSo much so that even in\nindividuals within a couple\nwhere one does a therapeutic\nsession and the other does not,\nthey still both feel quite\nmore bonded to the other.\nNow, oftentimes in the\nclinical therapeutic setting,\nboth members of a couple\nor romantic partnership,\nwhatever form it may\ntake or consuming MDMA\nand then thereby experiencing\nelevated oxytocin\nand this enhanced sense of bonding,\nand again, it's this autonomic bonding,\nbut it's so powerful.\nMeaning the oxytocin\nresponse is so powerful\nthat it doesn't even require\nthat both individuals\nexperienced this user\ninflection and oxytocin,\nand that's because one person's physiology\nis influencing the other,\nand oxytocin is this\nkind of bridging signal\nthat occurs in both nervous systems,\nsynchronizes things like heartbeat,\nobviously it's associated with touch.\nAnd so if people are touching\nor people are engaging\nin the sorts of behaviors\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nthat can increase oxytocin further,\nthat's going to further\nincrease the depth of the bond.\nBut the point here is that\nthere's actually a hormonal glue\nbetween individuals,\nokay, infant and mother,\nfriends, teammates, romantic\npartners, and so on.\nAnd that hormonal glue is oxytocin.\nNow people vary in the\nextent to which they feel\nor have the capacity to\nfeel bonded to anyone.\nAnd it is now generally understood\nthat some of that variation\nmight depend on variations\nin oxytocin receptors\nor what are called gene\npolymorphisms for oxytocin.\nGenes can have a number of\ndifferent sequences in them,\nthey're nucleotide sequences,\nwe won't go into genetics right now,\nAs and Gs and Cs and Ts\nin various combinations\nare what make up the genes.\nGenes are transcribed into RNA,\nRNA is translated into proteins\nthat affect cells, okay?\nThe oxytocin gene encodes for oxytocin\nand variants in that\ngene change the amount\nand function of oxytocin.\nThere's a really interesting study\npublished just this last year\nin a relatively new journal,\nthe journal has a kind of a\nunusual name it's Heliyon,\nI think it's Heliyon and not hellion,\nbut Heliyon, H-E-L-I-Y-O-N.\nThis is a Cell Press journal,\nas far as I can tell,\nit's a very solid journal,\ncertainly the Cell Press\nlabel is very stringent.\nAnd this paper is entitled,\nThe Relation Between Oxytocin Receptor\nGene Polymorphisms,\nwhich just means changes in\ngenes or variations in genes,\nAdult Attachment and\nInstagram Sociability,\nand Exploratory Analysis.\nThis is a really wild study,\nbut I liked the study, It's very thorough.\nFirst author, last name,\nCarollo, C-A-R-O-L-L-O.\nAnd what they found was that by analyzing\nthe genetics of different individuals\nwho are on social media,\nand looking at how many people\nthose individuals follow\nand how many people follow them,\nand what they come up with\nis a so-called social desirability index,\nthey were able to correlate\nin a very straightforward way\nthat people that carry certain\nvariants in the oxytocin\nand oxytocin receptor genes\nactually seek out more online,\nsocial Instagram interactions.\nSo some people I know, I\nwon't name their names,\nonly follow, you know, anywhere\nfrom zero to six accounts,\nother people follow thousands of accounts\nand they take the ratio of how\nmany accounts people follow\nversus how many followers they have,\narguably not a perfect measure,\nbut a nice one in the\nsense that you can do this\nin a completely unbiased way\nwith many, many thousands of subjects.\nAnd then they were able\nto get genomic analysis\nfrom a number of these subjects.\nAnd it turns out that people who have,\nlet's say higher levels\nof oxytocin function\nor potential levels of oxytocin function,\nactively seek out more social\ninteractions on social media.\nSo this, I think represents\nan important first\nin the area of how social media\nand data from social media\nare starting to merge with biological data\nin terms of predicting how\navidly people will seek out\nsocial interactions of an online type.\nAnd nowadays, we hear\na lot about how online,\nwe are connected but we're not really...\nWhat is it? We're communicating\nbut we're not connected\nor the connections aren't real.\nI think we're going to\nneed to revisit that.\nWhile I'm certainly a believer in the idea\nthat face-to-face communication\nand common interactions with people\nstanding in the same space\nor playing sports together,\nenjoying music together,\nenjoying meals together\nis vitally important,\nthere's an entire generation,\nor several generations of people\nthat are coming up who\nmuch of their social\ninteraction has been online.\nAnd if you think about it,\nall of the things that\nwe've spelled out earlier\nabout common mental narrative,\nthis left-brain system al Allan Schore,\nor autonomic bonding or\nsynchronization of heartbeats\naccording to common stories,\nall that is happening in\nonline social interactions.\nWhen a thousand of us\nlook at the exact same Instagram post,\nyes, we will have a thousand\nindependent responses to that,\nbut chances are many of us\nhave a similar or same response\nbased on the data that\nwe talked about earlier\nin synchronization of heartbeats.\nAnd so we are socially\nbonded with other people\nthrough social media,\nand it's very apparent\nthat the oxytocin system\nis playing some role in that.\nAnd this, if we zoom\nout makes perfect sense,\nbecause again, dopamine,\nserotonin, prolactin, oxytocin,\nnone of these systems were placed in us\nor are organized within us in\norder to encourage specific\nand only specific types\nof social interactions.\nThe one that we can say\nis absolutely critical\nis the child-parent interaction, right?\nBecause children simply can't\ntake care of themselves,\nthey need a caretaker.\nI should have said caretaker, not parent.\nBut infants, if they're\nnot taken care of will die.\nBut beyond that, we have evolved\nor come to realize many different types\nof social interactions,\nand online interactions\nnowadays are very, very common.\nI'm certainly involved in them,\nI'm guessing you're\ninvolved in them as well,\nwe're involved in one\nright now, for example.\nThe oxytocin system is\nabsolutely threaded through\nand largely responsible for those types\nof social bonds as well.\nAnd incidentally, \"Oxytocin\" is the name\nof the fifth song on Billie Eilish's\nsecond album, \"Happier Than Ever.\"\nSo we've covered a lot about the biology\nand indeed the neural\ncircuitry and neurochemistry\nand neuroendocrinology of social bonding.\nI want to make sure that I\nhighlight the key features\nthat go into any and all\nof your social bonds.\nFirst of all, all social\nbonds have the potential\nto include both what we\ncall emotional empathy\nand cognitive empathy.\nAnd so if you are\ninterested in establishing\nand deepening social bonds of any kind,\nit's important that you put some effort\ntowards this thing that\nwe call emotional empathy,\nwhich is really about\nsharing autonomic experience.\nNow, depending on the relationship\nthat will take on different contexts,\nwhat's appropriate in one type of bond\nis not going to be appropriate\nin another type of bond.\nPhysical contact for instance,\nis appropriate for certain types of bonds\nand not for others.\nNonetheless, emotional empathy\nand the synchronization\nof autonomic function,\nheart rate breathing, et cetera,\ncan be best accomplished\nby paying attention\nto external events in\nparticular narrative story music\nand perhaps sports or\nother types of experience\nas an external stimulus to drive synchrony\nof those internal states.\nThe other aspect of forming\ndeep bonds is cognitive empathy.\nAgain, cognitive empathy is\nnot about agreeing on things\nor viewing things the exact same way,\nit's about really gaining understanding\nof how somebody else\nthinks about something,\nreally paying attention to that,\nand then paying attention\nto how you think about\nand feel about something.\nSo that's what cognitive empathy is.\nSo emotional and\ncognitive empathy together\nare what make up these really\nrobust bonds of various kinds.\nNow we also talked about\nintroversion and extroversion,\nand I'd like to try and dismantle\nthe common misperceptions\nabout introversion extroversion\nbecause when we look at the\nneural circuitry, as you recall,\nintroverts are not people\nthat don't like social interaction,\nit's just that they\nfeel filled up or sated\nby less social interaction\nthan would be an extrovert.\nAnd that's because at least\naccording to the social\nhomeostasis circuit model,\nthey actually get more dopamine\nfrom less social interaction.\nOkay, it's like somebody who is sated\nby less amount of food.\nOkay, it doesn't mean they\ndon't have the same appetite,\nit just means that they\nget more from less.\nWhereas extroverts get\nless dopamine release\nfrom an equivalent amount\nof social interaction.\nAnd of course these aren't\nprecise measurements,\nbut on the whole extroverts\nneed more social interaction,\nmore frequent, more\nlong-lasting, et cetera,\nin order to achieve\nthat dopamine threshold,\nbecause again, dopamine is driving\nthat craving of social interaction.\nAnd once it's met, then people don't feel\nlike they have to seek\nsocial interaction as much.\nSo for those of you that feel\nas if you're an introvert\nor extrovert or that know\nintroverts and extroverts,\nit's not about how verbal people are,\nit's not about how much they seek out\nsocial interactions per se,\nit's about how much social interaction\nis enough for the given person.\nNow, the whole reason for\nproviding this framework,\nthis biological circuitry, et cetera,\nis not to simply put a reductionist view\non things that you\nalready realized and knew,\nbut rather to give you\nsome leverage points\nto understand how is it\nthat you form social bonds?\nHow is it that you might be challenged\nin forming certain types of social bonds?\nAnd to think about entry points,\nto both establishing\nand reinforcing social\nbonds of different kinds.\nHopefully it will also give\nyou insight into why breakups,\nwhether it be between\nfriendships or romantic partners\ncan be so painful.\nA breakup of any kind\ninvolves both a breaking\nof that emotional empathy\nand that cognitive empathy.\nAnd indeed it has a neuro-biological\nand hormonal underpinning, right?\nWe go into some sense, a social isolation,\neven if we're surrounded\nby other types of people,\nif one of our major sources of oxytocin\nor one of our major sources of dopamine\nsuddenly is not around,\nthat is incredibly devastating\nto a nervous system.\nAnd to borrow from the great psychologist\nand neurobiologist Lisa Feldman Barrett,\nwho says, you know, we\nare not just individuals,\nwe are nervous systems\ninfluencing other nervous systems\nand their nervous systems\nare influencing us.\nI think that's the right\nway to think about it.\nSo it should come as no surprise\nthat breakups of various\nkinds are very challenging\nregardless of what underlied that breakup,\nwhether or not somebody's moving\nor an actual decision of one person\nto leave the relationship\nor both, et cetera.\nOn the more positive\nside, largely biological,\nbut to some extent, psychological\nview of social bonding\nwill also allow you to\norient in this vast landscape\nthat we call social bonds.\nTo understand why it is\nperhaps that you seek out\nso many online interactions.\nMaybe you have the oxytocin polymorphism\nthat causes you to want\nmore, follow more accounts,\nor interact more with\npeople and comment more,\nrespond to comments, who knows?\nI'm also hoping that it\nwill allow you to get a lens\ninto how you can\nstrengthen the social bonds\nthat you want to strengthen,\nand to establish new social bonds\nthat you want to establish.\nNone of this has meant to manipulate\nor leverage social bonds\nthat wouldn't otherwise form,\nto the contrary, it's about identifying\nwhat are the specific routes\nby which social bonds are created\nand allowing you, I\nhope, to work with people\nthat you feel challenged in\nforming social bonds with,\nor maybe deciding to completely divorce\nfrom those social bonds entirely\nbecause there's absolutely no hope\nof ever forming emotional\nor cognitive empathy.\nI certainly acknowledge that\nthat could be the case too.\nSo there's both a light\nand a dark and a gray zone\nto this entire thing that\nwe call social bonding.\nWhat is not graded, but\nis absolute, as they say,\nis that social bonds are vitally important\nto us as a species,\nwhether or not they are at a\ndistance over social media,\nwhether or not they\nare in close proximity,\nactual physical contact.\nToday, what I've really\ntried to illustrate\nis that there are a common set\nof biological, neurochemical\nand hormonal underpinnings to\nwhat we call social bonding.\nAnd so while it is complex\nand it is subjective,\nit involves the hierarchies,\nit involves our previous upbringing,\nit involves our goals, et cetera,\nit is not infinitely complex,\nand in that sense, it is tractable.\nHopefully I've offered you some leavers\nor some entry points under\nwhich you can both understand\nand move towards social bonds\nthat would be more satisfying\nand more gratifying for you.\nThat's certainly one of the goals.\nThe other one is that hopefully\nif you are a clinician\nor simply the friend that people go to,\nor the family member that people go to\nwhen they are challenged\nthrough various challenges\nand social bonds,\nthat you can start to perhaps pass along\nsome of the information as a\nway of people understanding\nwhat they're going through\nas they are breaking up,\nbut also as they are falling in love,\nas they are forming attachments,\nand as they are being\nchallenged with attachments.\nThat's my hope, and especially as you head\ninto the holidays and end of year,\nbut also as it continues into 2022,\nI would hope that you\nwould take this knowledge\nand apply it in any of the ways\nthat you feel are meaningful\nand adaptive for you.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this

podcast\nat any level that you like.\nWe didn't talk about\nsupplements on today's episode\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nbut on many episodes we do.\nWhile supplements aren't\nnecessary for everybody,\nmany people derive\ntremendous benefit from them,\nfor things like enhancing the\ndepth and quality of sleep,\nfor things like focus,\nimmune system, et cetera.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to thorne.com/u/huberman.\nThe reason we partnered with Thorne\nis because thorn has the\nhighest levels of stringency\nin terms of the quality of the ingredients\nthat they include in their supplements\nand the precision of the amounts\nof the supplements that they include.\nThis is not true for a lot of other\nsupplement brands out there.\nThorne is partnered with the Mayo Clinic,\nwith all the major sports teams,\nso there's tremendous\nconfidence in their stringency.\nAgain, if you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can see all the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can get 20% off any\nof those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate deeper\ninto the Thorne site,\nthrough that portal,\nyou can also get 20% off\nany of the other supplements\nthat Thorne makes.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing the Huberman Lab\non Instagram and Twitter, please do so.\non Instagram, I regularly\nteach short snippets\nabout neuroscience and\nneuroscience-related tools,\nsome of that information overlaps\nwith what's covered on the\npodcast, often it does not.\nSo check us out at Huberman Lab\non Instagram and on Twitter.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
