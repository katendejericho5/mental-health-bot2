    "video_title": "Dr. David Buss: How Humans Select & Keep Romantic Partners in Short & Long Term",
    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nMy guest today is Dr. David Buss.\nDoctor Buss is a Professor of Psychology\nat the University of Texas, Austin,\nand he is one of the founding\nmembers and luminaries\nin the field of evolutionary psychology.\nDoctor Buss's laboratory is responsible\nfor understanding the\nstrategies that humans use\nto select mates in the\nshort- and long-term.\nAnd he is an expert in sex\ndifferences in mating strategy.\nHis laboratory has explored for instance,\nwhy women cheat on their spouses\nor their long-term partners,\nas well as why men tend to cheat\non their spouses and long-term partners.\nHe's also explored a\nnumber of things related\nto the courtship dance that we call dating\nand securing a mate,\nincluding the use of deception\nrelated to proclamations of love\nor promises of finances\nor sexual activity.\nDoctor Buss's laboratory\nhas also evaluated\nhow status is assessed,\nmeaning how we evaluate our own worth,\nand our potential as a mate, and who is,\nlet's just say within\nrange of a potential mate,\nboth in the short- and long-term.\nFor instance, today we\ntalk about how people\ndon't just make direct assessments\nof their own and other people's\nvalue as a potential mate,\nbut also using the assessments of others\nto indirectly determine whether or not\nthey stand a chance or\nnot in securing somebody\nas a short- or long-term mate.\nHis laboratory has also focused on\nsome of the complicated\nand varied emotions\nrelated to mating,\nlove, and relationships,\nsuch as lust and jealousy.\nAnd he's extensively explored\nsomething called mate poaching,\nor the various strategies\nthat men and women use\nto make sure that the person\nthat they want to be with,\nor the person they are with,\nis not with anyone else\nor seeking anyone else,\nand indeed that other people\ndon't seek their mate.\nDoctor Buss's work also relates\nto how biological\ninfluences, such as ovulation\nor time within the menstrual cycle\ninfluences mate selection\nor tendency to have sex or not\nwith a potential short- or long-term mate.\nAnd more recent work from\nDoctor Buss's laboratory\nfocuses on the darker aspects of mating\nand sexual behavior in humans,\nincluding stalking and sexual violence.\nToday, we discuss all those topics.\nWe also discuss some of the\nstrategies that humans can use\nto make healthy mate selection choices,\nand for those that are already\nin committed relationships\nto ensure healthy progression\nof those committed relationships.\nIn addition to publishing dozens\nof landmark scientific studies,\nDoctor Buss has authored\nmany important books,\na few of those include,\nThe Evolution of Desire,\nand Why Women Have Sex.\nAnd his most recent book\nis the one that I'm reading\nnow, which is called,\nWhen Men Behave Badly: The Hidden Roots\nof Sexual Deception,\nHarassment, and Assault.\nAnd it's an absolutely fascinating read.\nIt has endorsements from\nDoctor Robert Sapolsky,\nProfessor at Stanford,\nwho's been on this\npodcast as a guest before,\nas well as Steven Pinker\nand Jonathan Haidt,\nwho wrote The Coddling\nof the American Mind.\nIt's a really important book I believe,\nand one that doesn't just\nget into the darker aspects\nof human mating behavior and violence,\nbut also strategies that\npeople can take to ensure\nhealthy mating behavior and relationships.\nThere's so much rumor, speculation,\nand outright fabrication of ideas\nabout why humans select particular mates\nin the short- and long-term,\nwhat men and women do\ndifferently, and so on.\nWhat I love about Doctor Buss's work\nis that it's grounded\nin laboratory studies\nthat are highly quantitative\nusing rigorous statistics.\nAnd so throughout today's discussion,\nyou'll notice that I'm\nwrapped with attention,\ntrying to extract as\nmuch information as I can\nfrom Doctor Buss about the real science\nof human mate selection\nand mating strategy.\nI'm certain that everyone will take away\nextremely valuable\nknowledge that they can use\nin existing or future relationships\nfrom this discussion with Doctor Buss.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that\nthe cells and connections\nof our brain and visual system\nhave to contend with an\nenormous number of challenges\nin order to see clearly.\nFor instance, when you go from\na brightly lit environment\nto a dimmer environment or into a shadow,\nyour visual system has to adjust.\nThe problem with a lot of sunglasses\nand eyeglasses out there\nis that they don't work\nwell with those adjustments.\nRoka has overcome those\nchallenges, and as a consequence,\nno matter what environment you're in,\nyou see with crystal clarity.\nRoka eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are also terrific\nbecause they are extremely lightweight,\nso you don't even notice\nthat they're on your face.\nAnd they can be worn when\nworking or for school\nor just walking about, but\nalso when running or cycling.\nAnd indeed, if you get sweaty,\nthey won't slip off your face.\nThat's a terrific feature,\nbut they can be worn to do anything.\nI wear readers at night,\nand sometimes when I drive at night,\nand a wonderful thing about\nRoka eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis that unlike a lot of other\nperformance glasses out there\nthat make people look like cyborgs,\nor make it look like you're\ndefinitely off to exercise,\nRoka eyeglasses and\nsunglasses have a range\nof terrific aesthetics that\nyou could wear anywhere.\nIf you'd like to try Roka eyeglasses,\nyou can go to roka.com,\nthat's roka.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's Roka, roka.com,\nand enter the code

understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat strongly impact your\nimmediate and long-term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can get additional information\nabout how your body and\nyour nervous system work,\nyour immune system,\nin ways that can inform\nbetter health choices.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood and DNA tests out there\nis that you don't get any information\nabout what to do with\nthe data that you get.\nInside Tracker solves that problem.\nThey have a very easy to use dashboard,\nso when you get your numbers back,\nit can direct you towards\nspecific nutrition,\nsupplementation, or lifestyle\nchanges that you can make\nin order to bring the numbers\nfor given hormones, metabolic factors,\nimmune factors into the\nrange that's

episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation\napp that's supported\nby 25 peer-reviewed published studies,\nand benefits from over\n600,000 five star reviews.\nThere is now a plethora of scientific data\npointing to the fact that a\nregular meditation practice\nis immensely beneficial\nfor reducing anxiety,\nimproving sleep, improving focus,\nmany, many other aspects of\nmental and physical health.\nThe challenge many people have, however,\nis maintaining a regular\nmeditation practice.\nAnd indeed, I am one of those people.\nI've been meditating on\nand off for about 30 years,\nand I confess a lot of\ntimes it's more off than on,\nuntil a few years ago\nwhen I started using the Headspace app,\nand then I found it very easy,\nand I continue to find it easy\nto maintain a daily meditation practice.\nAnd that's because Headspace\nhas many meditations to select from.\nSo even if I only have\nfive minutes or 15 minutes,\nI'm able to do a meditation.\nI really enjoy those meditations,\nand I always see the benefits\nof those meditations.\nIn fact, if I just miss a couple of days,\nI start to notice that\nI'm not doing as well\nas when I'm meditating regularly.\nThe Headspace app makes\nit exceedingly easy\nto meditate regularly.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a free one-month trial\nwith Headspace's full\nlibrary of meditations\nfor every situation.\nThat's the best offer they have right now.\nSo again, if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer today.\nAnd now my conversation\nwith Doctor David Buss.\nDavid, delighted to be here.\nI've followed your work\nfor a number of years,\nand I'm excited to ask\nyou a number of questions\nabout these super interesting topics\nabout how people select mates,\nhow they lie, cheat,\nand, but also behave well\nin this dance that we call mate choice.\n- Yes, fortunately, there\nare well-behaving humans\nin the mix here.\n- Good to know.\nJust to start off,\nperhaps you could just\norient us a little bit\nabout mate choice.\nYou know, some of the primary criteria\nthat studies show men and women use\nin order to select mates,\nboth, shall we call them transient mates\nas well as lifetime mates?\n- Right, well, that's\na critical distinction,\nbecause what people look for\nin a long-term committed mateship,\nlike a marriage partner or a\nlong-term romantic relationship\nis different from what people look for\nin a hookup or casual sex,\nor one night stand, or\neven a brief affair.\nSo that's actually critical.\nI wonder if we could maybe\njust back up a second\nand just talk a little bit\nabout the theoretical framework\nfor understanding mate choice.\nSo it basically stems from\nDarwin's theory of sexual selection,\nand most people, when they\nthink about evolution,\nthey think about, the cliche\nis like survival of the fittest\nor nature, red in tooth and claw.\nAnd Darwin noticed that\nthere were phenomena\nthat couldn't be explained\nby this so-called survival selection,\nthings like the brilliant\nplumage of peacocks,\nsex differences, like in,\nyou know, stags, for example,\nhave these massive antlers\nand the females of the species do not.\nAnd so he came up with the\ntheory of sexual selection,\nwhich deals not with the\nevolution of characteristics\ndue to their survival advantage,\nbut rather due to their mating advantage.\nAnd he identified two causal processes\nby which mating advantage could occur.\nOne is intrasexual competition\nwith the stereotyping,\ntwo stags locking horns in combat\nwith the victor gaining\nsexual access to the female,\nloser ambling off with a broken antler\nand dejected in low self-esteem\nand needing psychotherapy perhaps,\nor mate value improvement therapy.\nAnd the logic was whatever qualities\nled to success in these same-sex battles,\nthose qualities get passed\non in greater numbers.\nAnd so you see evolution,\nwhich is change over time\nand increase in frequency\nof the characteristics\nassociated with winning these,\nwhat Darwin called contest competition.\nAnd we know that the logic\nof that is more general now\nand involves things like in our species\ncompeting for position\nin status hierarchies.\nSo anyway, so intrasexual\ncompetition is one,\nbut the second most\nrelevant to your question\nabout mate choice is\npreferential mate choice,\nthat was the second causal pathway.\nAnd the logic there is that\nif members of one sex\nagree with one another,\nif there's some consensus\nabout the qualities that are desired,\nthen those of the opposite sex\nwho possess the desired qualities\nor embody those desired qualities,\nthey have a mating advantage.\nThey get chosen, they get preferred.\nThose lacking desired\nqualities get banished,\nshunned, ignored,\nor in the modern\nenvironment become incels.\nAnd so the logic there is very simple,\nbut also very powerful.\nAnd that is that whatever\nqualities are desired,\nconsensually desired,\nif there's some heritable basis to those,\nthen those increase in\nfrequency over time.\nAnd so, and in the human case,\nthese two causal processes\nof sexual selection\nare related to each other,\nin that the preferences, the\nmate preferences of one sex\nbasically set the ground\nrules for competition\nin the opposite sex.\nSo if, for example,\nhypothetically women\npreferred to mate with men\nwho were able and willing\nto devote resources to them,\nthen that would create\ncompetition among men\nto claw their way, you know,\nand beat out other men\nin resource acquisition,\nand then displaying that their willingness\nto commit that to a particular woman.\nAnd same with women though.\nOne of the interesting things about humans\nis that we have mutual mate choice,\nwhich is not true in all species.\nAnd that is that it's not\njust a matter of, you know,\nyou selecting someone to be your mate,\nthey have to reciprocally select you.\nAnd so with mutual mate choice,\nwe have both preferences,\nmate preferences,\nthat women have, and mate\npreferences that men have,\nand consequently competition among men\nfor access to the most desirable women\nin competition among women for access\nto the most desirable man.\nSo that's sort of a little\nbit of theoretical backdrop.\nSo you asked, well,\nwhat are the qualities\nthat men and women desire,\nand maybe we'll start\nwith long-term mating,\nand then shift to short-term mating.\nAnd long-term mating is interesting\nin and of itself in that it's very rare\nin the mammalian world.\nSo there are more than 5,000\nspecies of primates of which,\nI'm sorry, more than\n5,000 species of mammals,\nof which we are one,\nbut the percentage of mammals\nthat have anything resembling\nlike a pair bond of\nlong-term mating strategy,\nit's about 3-5%.\nIt's extremely rare.\nAnd even our closest primate\nrelatives, the chimpanzees,\nthey don't have a\nlong-term mating strategy.\nThey don't have anything\nresembling pair bond in mating.\nIn chimps, the females come into estrus,\nalmost all the sexual activity occurs\nduring the estrous phase.\nAfter that, males and females\nbasically ignore each\nother for the most part,\nwith some exceptions.\nBut with humans,\nyou have the evolution of\nlong-term pair bonding,\nattachment, a heavy male\ninvestment in offspring,\nrelatively concealed by ovulation.\nAnd so these are kind of unique aspects\nof the human mating system.\nSo to get to your question,\nso what are the qualities?\nSo the best, the most large scale study\nthat's been done on this,\nis a study that I did a while back\nof 37 different cultures.\nAnd it's now been replicated\nby other researchers,\nbut basically what we found\nis three clusters of things.\nWe found qualities that\nboth men and women wanted\nin a long-term mate.\nWe found some qualities that\nwere sex differentiated,\nwhere women prefer them more than men\nor men prefer them more than women.\nAnd then we found some attributes\nthat were highly variable across cultures\nin whether people found these\nas desirable or indispensable\nor irrelevant, in a mate.\nAnd so I could give\nexamples of each of these.\n- Yeah, that would be great.\nI'd love to know what some\nof the common themes were\nacross these cultures\nin terms of what's being\nmate and sexually select for.\n- Yeah, so some of the things that were,\nso we talk about universal desires,\nso things that men and women share.\nThere are things like\nintelligence, kindness,\nmutual attraction and love,\nwhich is really kind of heartwarming\nbecause some people think that love\nis a recent western invention\nby some European poets,\nbut it turns out it's not true.\nYou can go to the Kung San in Botswana,\nand they describe pretty\nmuch the same experience\nas a falling in love as we do.\nAnd even describe the distinction\nbetween this kind of\ninfatuation stage of love\nand the attachment phase where,\nyou can't maintain this frenzy\nof infatuation and\nobsession for very long,\nsix weeks, maybe six months at most,\notherwise you can get nothing\nelse done in your life.\nThose are those dopamine circuits\nfiring at high frequency.\n- Yeah, so mutual attraction, love,\ngood health, dependability,\nemotional stability,\nalthough there's a bit\nof a sex difference there\nwith women preferring\nit a bit more than men.\nAnd so basically, and\nthese may seem obvious.\nSo no one wants a stupid, mean,\nugly, disease-ridden mate.\nAnd so perhaps obvious, but,\nbut no one knew this in advance\nof the 37 culture study.\nSo these were some universal preferences.\nSo you go to the Zulu tribe\nin South Africa or, you know,\nRio de Janeiro in Brazil or\nPortugal or Oslo,\nor anywhere in the world,\nand these are qualities that\npeople universally desire\nin long-term mates.\nSex differences.\nSo sex differences basically\nfell into two clusters.\nSo women more than men\nprioritized good earning capacity,\nslightly older age,\nand the qualities associated\nwith resource acquisition.\nSo these are things like\na man's social status.\nDoes he have drive? Is he ambitious?\nDoes he have a good\nlong-term resource trajectory\nis one way that I like to phrase it,\nbecause women often they\ndon't look at necessarily\nthe resources that a guy\npossesses at this moment,\nbut what is his trajectory?\n- Just sorry to interrupt, but may I ask,\nis there anything known\nabout the commonalities\nof how that is assessed?\nYou know, is it, you know,\nhe's rolling out of bed\nearly in running eight miles,\nhe's showing proficiency in school,\nhe handles himself well\nsocially at parties,\nisn't drinking too much, but knows when,\nobviously they're\nintegrating multiple cues,\nthe brain is a complex place,\nbut is there any information\nabout what those variables\nare across cultures?\n- Yeah, well I think that\nthere's been less attention to that,\nso that's a great question.\nOne of the things that we\ndo know across cultures\nis that women attend to\nthe attention structure.\nSo the attention structure\nis a key determine of status.\nSo the people who are high in status\nare those to whom the most\npeople pay the most attention.\n- So the attention of others to them,\nnot how well a given potential mate\ncan focus and pay attention, necessarily.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nAnd, but women look, I mean, you know,\nis the guy, even in\nthe modern environment,\nthe guy spending eight hours\na day playing video games,\neating Cheetos and drinking beer,\nor is he devoting effort to\nhis professional development?\nSo hard work, ambition.\nDoes he have clear goals or\nis he in an existential crisis\nnot knowing what he's\ngoing to do with his life?\nSo those are some of the\nqualities that people look for.\nAnd also women use\nwhat's called in the\nliterature, mate choice copying.\nAnd this is related in part\nto the attention structure,\nthat is, guys who have\npassed the filters of multiple women.\nThose are like, pre-approved men.\nSo we've done studies\nwhere you just take a guy,\nphotograph him alone\nversus, take the same guy,\nput an attractive woman next to him,\nor put two women next to him,\nand women judge exactly the same guy\nto be much more attractive,\nif he's paired with women,\nthen if he's not.\nAnd some guys exploit\nthis in the modern world\nby hiring wing women to go with\nthem on dates and so forth,\nthis is my sister or a former\ngirlfriend or whatever.\nSo,\nbut you're correct in,\nin that women use multiple\ncues to assess these things,\nand they change over time. You know, so,\nin the modern environment,\neven when things like\nthe attention structure,\ndoes this guy have a\nmillion Twitter followers\nor three Twitter followers.\nSo that is an index of\nthe attention structure\nand hence the status of the guy\nwithin the broader community.\nSo, and from an evolutionary perspective,\nit's reasonable that women\nwould prioritize these qualities\nbecause of the tremendous asymmetry\nin our reproductive biology,\nnamely that fertilization\noccurs internally within women,\nnot within men,\nwomen bear the burdens of\nthe nine month pregnancy,\nwhich is metabolically expensive,\nas well as creating opportunity costs\nin terms of mobility and,\nand solving other tasks\nthat people need to solve\nin the course of their lives.\nAnd so one way to phrase\nthat is that the costs\nof making a bad mate choice\nare much heavier for women\nwhen it comes to sexual\nbehavior certainly,\nbecause, and the benefits correspondingly\nof making a wise mate choice\nare higher for women\nin the sexual context.\nBut as I said, we have mutual\nmate choice in our species.\nAnd so what do men value more than women?\nPhysical attractiveness.\n- They ranked that as a\nmore important criteria\nthan do women about men?\n- Yes, exactly.\n- Consistently across cultures?\n- Consistently, and it's not that women\nare indifferent to it.\nSo women do pay attention to\na guy's physical appearance,\nhis fitness and so forth,\nand guys are actually off base\nin thinking that women\nprefer more muscular men\nthan they actually do.\nSo like in muscle magazines,\nthese men with bulging\nbiceps and so forth,\nwomen don't find that especially,\nbut they do prioritize fit men,\na good shoulder to hip ratio\nand other qualities of\nphysical appearance,\nas well as things like cues to health.\nSo physical appearance provides\na wealth of information\nabout a person's health status,\nbut also provides for men\na wealth of information\nabout a woman's fertility,\nher reproductive value.\nNow not that men think\nabout that consciously.\nI mean, men don't walk down the street\nand see a woman and say,\noh, I find her attractive\nbecause I think she must be very fertile.\nMaybe a few weird people do that,\nbut most men just it's like,\nthey just find those cues attractive.\nAnd the cues are cues\nassociated with youth and health\nbecause we know that youth\nis a very powerful cue\nto fertility and reproductive value.\nSo men prioritize physical appearance,\nand in the field of psychology,\nI was taught when I was an undergraduate\nthat you can't judge a book by its cover,\nthat physical attractiveness\nwas infinitely arbitrary,\ninfinitely culturally variable.\nAnd it's simply not true.\nWe know now based on the last 20 years\nof scientific studies,\nthat the cues that men\nfind attractive women\nare not at all arbitrary.\nThere is some variation across cultures,\nlike in relative\nplumpness versus thinness,\nbut things like clear skin,\nclear eyes, symmetrical features,\na low waist to hip ratio,\nfull lips, lustrous hair,\nall these are qualities that\nare associated with youth\nand health, and hence have heavy evolved\nto be part of our standards\nof attractiveness.\nAnd so, it's not just that men\nare these superficial creatures\nwho evaluate women on\nthe basis of appearance,\nthere is an underlying\nlogic to why they do so.\nAnd as I said, relative youth,\nthis age thing is one of\nthe largest sex differences\nthat you find in long-term mate selection,\nwith women preferring somewhat older men,\nand men preferring somewhat younger women.\nIs there a consistent age gap\nto relate to that statement?\n- Yes, there is.\nSo the age gap though depends\non the age of the man.\nSo, we can document this,\nso in my studies,\nwhat we found is that men preferred women\nwho were about three to four years\nyounger than they were on average.\nAnd I'll qualify this in a second.\nWomen preferred guys who were about\nthree and a half to four\nand a half years older\nthan they were.\nSo there was a sex difference\ngoing in the opposite direction.\nBut as men get older,\nthey prefer women who are\nincreasingly younger than they are.\nSo one way to gauge this,\nso there are actual marriage statistics,\nand then there are expressed preferences,\nand both sexes kind of converge.\nSo if you look at, you\nknow, first marriage,\nsecond marriage, third marriage,\nif people get divorced and remarried.\nAverage age gap is, in America anyway,\nis three years at first marriage\nwith the guys being older,\nfive years at second marriage,\nand eight years at third marriage.\nSo that is, as men are getting older\nand getting divorced and remarried,\nthey are marrying women\nwho are increasingly\nyounger than they are.\nIn terms of preferences,\nit's also expressed in preferences.\nSo it doesn't go down, so like a,\nsay a 25-year-old man would say,\nprefer a woman who's\n20 or in her early 20s,\n35-year-old man might prefer a woman\nwho's in her late 20s or early 30s.\nA 50-year-old man might prefer a woman\nwho is say, 35 to 38.\nSo the preferences do go up,\nbut the gap gets increasingly larger.\nAnd the reason that you\ndon't see things like,\nwhy aren't men preferring women?\nSo peak fertility in humans\nis around age 24, 25.\nAnd so you say, well,\nwhy aren't the 60-year-old men\nprioritizing 25-year-old women?\nWell, as I mentioned,\nit's a reciprocal mutual\nmate choice phenomenon.\n- She constraints the equation.\n- Well, she constrains it,\nbut also a marriage and long-term mating\nare things other than reproductive unions\nin the modern environment.\nThat is they're,\nyou know, you're supposed\nto do things as a couple.\nAnd if you get too large an age gap,\nthen essentially you're\nin different cultures.\nYou grow up with different songs,\nand if the cultural gap gets too large,\nyou don't understand each other.\nSo, there are constraints on that,\nbut if you look at contexts\nwhere there are no\nconstraints of that sort,\nso historically kings,\nemperors, despots, et cetera,\nand I'll give one more modern example,\nthey basically prefer young,\nfertile, attractive females.\nAnd if they have harems,\nthey stock the harems with those,\nand then circulate them out\nwhen they're 30, and so forth.\nAnd so if you look at marriage systems\nthat are unconstrained,\nthe preferences are more\nlikely to be revealed,\nor within cultures.\nThat is, if you look at men\nwho were in a position\nto get what they want.\nSo as Mick Jagger noted,\nyou can't always get what you want,\nbut if you try sometimes,\nyou get what you need.\n- I hear that most of the\ntime he got what he needed,\n- He got what he wanted,\nand maybe what he needed,\nbut he was in a position.\nI don't know if he still is,\nhe's in his seventies now,\nbut he was in a position\nas was, let's say,\nRod Stewart, to take another\nexample, or Leonardo DiCaprio.\nIf you were a male who's in a position\nwhere there are thousands of women\npotentially available to you,\nand you can have your pick,\nthen you see that clearer\nexpression for younger females.\nThere was a chart that was\nfloating around the internet\nof the girlfriends of Leonardo\nDiCaprio as he got older.\nAnd as he's getting older and older,\nand the graph of the\nage of his girlfriends,\nit basically stayed the same,\nit was in the early twenties or so.\n- He values consistency.\n- Consistency.\nBut, so anyway, the data converge on that.\nSo these are universal sex differences\nin long-term mate selection.\nSo now when we shift to,\nand I should mention cultural variability,\nbecause that's a critical thing,\nbecause there is in my 37 culture study,\nwhat I found was the\npreference for virginity,\nthat is no prior sexual experience,\nthat was the most variable\ndesire across cultures.\nSo you had cultures, like at\nthe time of the study, China,\nit was basically indispensable\nthat a partner be a virgin.\nAnd then at the other end,\nyou have Sweden where\nSwedes typically place\nclose to zero value on it,\nand some even find it undesirable.\nLike, you're weird if you're a virgin.\nAnd so you have this whole spectrum.\n- This is virginity in the\nfemale, or is this also,\nin China was it preference\nthat the male and the female be virgins?\nIt's a mutual mate a selection?\n- Yeah, it was a\npreference for both sexes.\n- Interesting.\n- But it's a good question,\nbecause where there was a sex difference,\nit was always in the direction\nof males preferring\nvirginity more than females,\nand we've gone back to China.\nSo I still do research in\nChina among other places.\nAnd we've gone back and retested\nmodern urban populations,\nand the importance of virginity\nhas gone down in China,\nespecially in the urban areas,\nand the sex difference\nthat didn't exist before,\nhas now emerged, where males\nvalue it more than females.\nAnd I think part of it\nwas in previous times,\nyou hit ceiling effects, you\nknow, where both sexes say,\nyeah, it's absolutely\nimportant to be a Virgin.\nSo, there's cultural variation\nand cultural change over time\nin some of these qualities.\nBut the sex differences that I described\nhave remained invariant over the years.\nSo since my 37 culture study,\nthis has been replicated in,\nat least a couple of\ndozen different cultures,\nand we've gone back to\nsome of the cultures.\nSo I mentioned, we've gone back\nto China, Brazil, and India,\nto look at cultural changes over time,\nand there have been,\nyou know, in some cases,\ndramatic cultural changes over time.\nBut the sex differences that\nI described are invariant.\nThey haven't changed a bit.\n- I'd be remiss if I didn't ask\nabout truth telling and deception,\nbecause some of the measures\nthat you're describing,\nage, for instance, one can\npotentially lie about, right?\nI'm guessing that there are people\nwho do that on online\nprofiles and whatnot.\nFrom what I understand,\npeople also lie about\nheight and other features\non online profiles,\nbut some of them are much\nharder to hide, right?\nEventually the truth comes out about some,\nif not all of these things.\nSo, if you would,\ncould you tell us about how men and women\nleverage deception versus truth telling\nand communicating some of the things\naround mate choice selection?\n- Yeah, well,\nso basically both men\nand women do deceive,\nso we have the modern cultural\ninvention of online dating,\nwhich, you know,\nwas little-used 10 years ago,\nand virtually absent 20 years ago.\nAnd people do lie, but they\nlie in predictable ways.\nThey lie in ways that attempt to embody\nthe mate preferences of the person\nthey're trying to attract.\nAnd so men do lie.\nThey deceive about their\nincome, their status.\nSo they exaggerate their\nincome by about 20%.\nThey tack on about two\ninches to their height.\nSo if they're five ten,\nthey round up to six feet.\nSo they don't like, if they're five ten,\nthey don't say that they're gigantic,\nbut they kind of round it up\nin the more desirable direction.\nWomen tend to deceive about weight.\nSo they tend to shave about 15 pounds\noff of their reported weight,\nand both sexes post photos that\nare not truly representative\nof what they actually look like.\nSo they might post photos\nof themselves when they were\nyounger, or they're even advice,\ntips on how to create the best\nselfie, of the best angle,\nthat will maximally, you know,\nenhance what you look like.\n- Or just doctoring of\nphotos I'm guessing.\n- Oh yeah, Photoshopping, absolutely.\nAnd one of the things about\nit now, you say, well,\ndo people find out, of\ncourse, people do find out.\nI'll just give you one story\nabout a colleague of mine,\nwho is a male, who's\ndoing internet dating.\nAnd he picked only women\nwho self-described as sevens\non the one to seven on attractiveness.\nSo the most attractive, as self-reported,\nand se he went out with this one woman,\nand she was missing her front teeth.\nAnd he said, well, call me picky,\nbut missing her front teeth.\nAnd she thinks she's like\nthe top of attractiveness,\nhe was a little disappointed about that.\nAnd women of course are disappointed,\nthey meet a guy who they\nthink is this physically fit,\nyou know, athletic guy,\nand he comes up he's, you know,\n300 pounds and overweight.\nSo people do find out.\nAnd there are some\ninternet dating sites have\nkind of a vetting of the\naccuracy of something.\nSo some things you can look\nup through public records,\nand does this guy have a\ncriminal record, for example,\nis he on a, you know, a\nsexual offenders website?\nSo there's some things you can verify.\nBut what I tell people is,\nyou really have to meet the\nperson and interact, you know,\nbecause in part because of the deception,\nbut also because what\nhappens with internet dating\nis that the photograph tends to overwhelm\nall the other cues and all the other cues\nare written statements.\nAnd we weren't really evolved\nto process written statements,\nbut we were evolved to\nrespond to physical cues, but,\nand men tend to attend to the visual cues\nmuch more than women.\nSo women in their mate selection,\nthey have olfactory cues to\nwhat does the guy sound like?\nHis vocal qualities,\nthat's auditory cues,\nbut olfactory cues,\nwhat does he smell like?\nAnd so women have a more acute\nsense of smell than men do.\nAnd so if the guy doesn't smell right,\neven if he embodies all these\nother qualities women want,\nthat's a deal breaker.\nAnd so I encourage people just, you know,\nstop with a hundred texts\nback and forth or messaging,\nand meet a person for a\ncup of coffee and interact.\nAnd then you'll, you know,\nyou'll get a more accurate\nbead on the person.\nAnd then of course, some\nqualities you can't assess\neven with a half-hour\ninteraction, you can tell a lot,\nbut things like emotional stability,\nor things that have to\nbe assessed over time.\nAnd so one of the things\nthat I advise people to do,\nand I'm not in the advice-giving business,\nbut people ask me all the time.\nIf they find out what I\nstudy, they say, well,\nI got this problem,\ncan you give me advice?\nBut one of the things to assess,\nthings like emotional stability,\nwhich is absolutely critical\nin long-term mating,\nis to do something like\ngo on a trip together,\ntake a vacation where you're\neven in an unfamiliar environment where\nyou have to cope with things\nthat you're not familiar with.\nAnd as opposed to an environment\nwhere it's very predictable,\nand so you get a greater exposure,\nbecause one of the hallmarks\nof emotional instability\nis how they respond to stress.\nSo emotionally unstable people\ntend to have a long latency\nto return to baseline\nafter a stressful event.\nAnd so this is the sort of information\nyou can't get on a coffee date,\nyou can only get by\nassessing it over time.\n- Somebody whose laboratory studies stress\nand tools to combat stress.\nThat's great, it's yet\nmore incentive for people\nto develop self-regulatory\nmechanisms for themselves.\nI'm guessing many of the\nfeatures of deception\nin this context were present\nlong before internet dating.\nAnd so is it, it's somewhat\ndark to think about, but is,\nis deception built into this dance\nthat we call mate selection?\nAnd has it been built in for a long time,\nor is this something that\nyou think has emerged more\nas people are approaching each other\nthrough these electronic,\nweb-based mediums?\n- I mean, some forms of\ndeception have been there\nfor a long time over human\nevolutionary history.\nSo one form of deception,\nwhich we haven't mentioned is deception\nabout whether you're interested\nin a long-term committed relationship\nor a short-term hookup.\nAnd so there's deception about that,\nespecially on the part of men.\nSo men who were\ninterested, like on Tinder,\nit has been reported,\nalthough Tinder denies this,\nthere's been reported that something like\n30% of the men on Tinder,\nare either married or in\nlong-term committed relationships,\nand they're looking for\nsomething on the side, but\nin terms of successfully\nattracting a mate,\nthe overt display that,\nhey I'm interested in\njust a short-term hookup.\nI'm interested in sex, so I\nwant to have sex right now.\nLet's just go back to my apartment.\nThese are very ineffective tactics.\nAnd so effective tactics for\nmen are often displaying cues\nto long-term interests.\nAnd so, and of course\nthat's effective for a woman\nwho's seeking a long-term interest.\nAnd so, that's a deception.\nSo we find in our studies of deception,\nthat men tend to exaggerate\nthe depths of their feelings for a woman,\nexaggerate how similar they are,\nand how aligned they are in their values\nand religious orientations\nand political values and so forth.\nAnd so, I think there's\ndeception around that,\nand I think that's\nprobably an evolutionarily\nrecurrent form of deception\nthat women have defenses\nagainst by the way.\nBut I think that modern internet dating\nopens the door for certain\ntypes of deception,\nthat were at a minimum,\nmore difficult to accomplish ancestrally.\nSo like things like\nPhotoshopping, you know,\nwasn't available back then.\nplus we evolved in the\ncontext of small group living,\nwhere you not only had\nyour own personal observations\nof someone's qualities,\nyou had also your relatives, your friends,\nallies, the social\nreputation that someone had.\nAnd these are all critical\nsources of information\nthat are less available\nin modern environments\nbecause, you know, people migrate,\nthey move from place to place.\nThey can close down one internet\nprofile and put up another,\nor that could have six\ngoing simultaneously.\nSo the modern environment\nopens up the door\nfor forms of deception\nthat weren't available\nor weren't available to the\nsame degree, ancestrally.\n- I see.\nVery interesting.\nWould you mind touching\non some of the features\nthat are selected for,\nin terms of sexual partner choice?\nWe talked a little bit about mate choice,\nbut in terms of sexual partner choice,\nare there any good studies exploring\nwhat people are selecting for,\nor is it that they are\nboth just in a state\nof pure hypothalamic drive?\nI'm a neuroscientist, after all.\nAnd therefore it's hard to\nrecreate in the laboratory.\n- Well, no, no.\nWe do know something about that,\nand we know something\nabout how the preferences\nfor a sex partner differ\nfrom preference for a long-term mate.\nThere is overlap of course,\nbut one thing is physical appearance.\nSo physical appearance for women\nis important in long-term mating,\nnot as important as it is for men,\nbut it becomes more important\nin short-term mating.\nAnd so it is the guy good-looking?\nSo those physical attributes\nare more important for women.\nThey are, they remain important for men,\nphysical appearance in short-term mating,\nbut with the footnote that men are willing\nto drop their standards\nin short-term mating,\nif it's low commitment,\nlow risk, just sex,\nwithout entangling commitments.\nWomen are more likely to prioritize\nwhat I call bad boy qualities.\nSo guys who are very self-confident,\nguys who are strut, guys\nwho are a little arrogant,\nguys who are risk-taking,\nguys who defy conventions,\nwomen are more attracted to those guys\nin short-term mating\nthan long-term mating.\nAnd whereas in long-term mating,\nthey go more for the good dad qualities.\nIs this guy dependable?\nIs he going to be a good\nfather to my children?\nAnd then also in short-term mating\nwomen use that mate-copying a heuristic.\nThat is, if there are\nthousands of other women\nwho find him attractive,\nwomen find him attractive.\nAnd so that's why you have\nthe groupie phenomenon.\nSo, with the rock stars, for example,\nthere are thousands of screaming women,\nall of whom want to sleep\nwith this famous rock star.\nAnd they use that as\ninformation they find,\nif you took like a still photo\nof some of these rock stars\nand asked women how attractive the guy is,\nversus tell 'em he's a famous rock star\nand showed the thousands\nof women screaming at him,\nthat they judge him entirely differently,\nin terms of his attractiveness.\nSo even, and this is an important point\nthat women's attraction to\nmen is more context specific,\nand varies more across contexts,\nthan men's attraction to women.\nAnd so I'll give you\njust an example of that.\nThis is a female colleague\nof mine went to a conference,\nan academic conference,\nand she found the organizer\nof this conference\nto be really attractive,\nand then saw him six\nmonths later and wondered,\nwell, what was I thinking?\nHe doesn't seem very attractive at all.\nAnd what it was is when\nhe was the organizer,\nhe was at the center of\nthe attention structure.\nYou know, he was the guy up\non stage directing everybody\nand everyone was attending to him.\nAnd then when he was\njust a normal presenter\nat a conference,\nhe didn't command the attention structure\nlike he did when he was the organizer.\nAnd so this is just an illustration of how\ncircumstance-dependent women's\nmate attraction is for guys.\nIt depends on, you know, his status,\nthe number of women that\nare attracted to him,\nthe attention structure,\nhow he interacts with a puppy, or a baby.\nIf he's ignoring a baby in distress\nor positively interacting\nwith a young child.\nAll these things, whereas for\nmen, it almost doesn't matter.\nContext is more irrelevant.\nThey're honing in on the\nspecific psychophysical cues\nthat the woman is displaying,\nand context be damned.\n- Very interesting.\nLet's talk about infidelity\nin committed relationships.\nWhat are some of the consistent\nfindings around reasons for,\nand maybe even long-term\nconsequences of infidelity\nfor men and women, and\nthis could be marriage,\nor long-term partnership, or, you know,\ninfidelity of any kind, I suppose.\nI'm guessing it does happen.\nHow frequent is it?\n- Yeah, that's the interesting thing.\nWell, how frequent it is,\nis difficult to gauge because,\nit's one of the forms of human conduct\nthat people like to keep secret.\nSo, if you go back now say 70 years\nto the classic Kinsey studies,\nthe questions about infidelity\nwere the questions that most\npeople refused to answer.\nAnd when the question was brought up,\ncaused more people to\ndrop out of the study.\nAnd so that kind of tells\nyou something that, I mean,\nwhat do people conceal?\nYou know, infidelity, incest, murder,\nthere is a small handful of things\nthat people universally want to conceal,\nand infidelity is one of them.\nSo, but people do it.\nAnd so Kinsey estimated\n26% of married women\ncommitted an infidelity at some\npoint during their marriage,\nand about 50% of men.\nOther studies have given lower figures.\nAnd so the exact figures\nbounce around, depending on,\nyou know, anonymity provided\nand how comfortable they are\nwith the interviewer and so forth.\n- And by infidelity,\ndoes that mean intercourse\nwith somebody else?\nSo we're not talking about quote\nunquote, emotional affairs.\nWe're talking about just sex with somebody\nother than their committed partner\nunbeknownst to their partner.\n- Right, right.\nAnd there are other forms of infidelity,\nwhich we could get into,\nincluding emotional infidelity\nand financial infidelity.\nBut here, we're just talking about,\nfor the moment, sexual infidelity.\nAnd the interesting thing\nabout sexual infidelity\nis that the sexes really\ndiffer fundamentally\nin the motives for committing infidelity.\nSo for men, the primary motive,\nand these are on average sex differences.\nSo whenever I talk about sex differences,\nI'm talking about on\naverage sex differences,\ncause there's overlap\nin the distributions.\nSo these are generalizations\nof which there are exceptions.\nSo for men, it's mainly a\nmatter of sexual variety.\nSo about 70% of the men,\nit's the opportunity presented itself,\nI was out of town and\nI had this opportunity.\nSo low risk, low cost\npursuit of sexual variety,\nsexual novelty, is a\nkey motivation for men.\n- Sorry to interrupt.\nSo 70% of men that cheat\nthat's the primary cause,\nor is it that 70% of men do cheat?\n- No, no, no.\nOf the men who cheat, 70%,\nthank you for that clarification,\nof the men who do cheat 70%\ncite that as the key motive,\nthe key reason why they\ncommitted an infidelity.\n- Sort of like why mountain\nclimbers climb mountains,\nbecause they're there?\n- Right, right.\nBecause they're there,\nthe comedian, I think\nit was Chris Rock said,\nmen are only as faithful\nas their opportunity.\n- Or how available their\npassword on their phone is\nto their partner.\n- Right, right.\nSo, but, and that's an exaggeration,\nbut if you look at women, this\njust desire for pure novelty,\nsexual variety, is much less of a motive,\nbut women who have affairs\ncite that they're unhappy with\ntheir primary relationship,\nemotionally unhappy, or sexually unhappy,\nand typically both.\nAnd this may seem like\ntotally obvious that,\nwell, of course,\npeople if they're\nunhappy in a relationship\nare more likely to stray,\nbut in fact, it's not true for men.\nSo if you compare men who are\nhappy with their marriage,\nand men who are not happy\nwith their marriage,\nthere's no difference in\ntheir infidelity rates.\nAnd I think it goes down\nto that issue of, you know,\nmotive for seeking variety.\nSo now why do women do it?\nBecause it's a risky endeavor.\nShe risks her long-term mate\nor losing her long-term mate.\nIt's risky in terms of\nreputational damage for both sexes.\nSo it's a risky thing.\nWhy do women do it?\nAnd there are two competing\nhypotheses, at least two,\nbut there are two primary\ncompeting hypotheses\nin the evolutionary literature.\nOne is called the dual\nmating strategy hypothesis,\nwhere women are seeking to\nget resources and investment\nfrom one guy and good\ngenes from another guy.\nAnd in principle that can work.\nAnd I initially this wasn't a\nhypothesis original with me.\nThis is, Steve Gangestad, Randy Thornhill,\nand some others, Marty Hazelton,\na former student of mine,\nhave advocated this dual\nmating strategy hypothesis.\nAnd originally I was endorsed it,\nbecause the data seemed to support it,\nand we can get into which\ndata seemed to support it.\nBut over time I became\nmore and more dubious\nabout this hypothesis,\nand instead have advocated\nwhat I call the mate switching hypothesis.\nAnd so if you look at a\nwhole host of information\naround why women have affairs,\nit's not compatible\nwith the dual mating strategy hypothesis.\nSo, and is compatible\nwith the mate switching,\nthat is, women who are looking to either\ndivest themselves from\nan existing mateship,\nor trade up in the mating market to a mate\nwho's more compatible with\nthem or higher in mate value,\nor simply see whether they're\nsufficiently desirable,\nso that it eases the transition\ninto the mating pool,\nor keeping a mate made as\na potential backup mate,\nwhat I call mate insurance.\nYou have car insurance if\nsomething bad happens to your car,\nhouse insurance,\nwe also have mate insurance, you know.\nOne women said, men are like soup,\nyou always want to have\none on the back burner.\nSo, whether that's the\nbest analogy or not,\nI'm not sure, but it kind\nof captures something,\nabout why so, well, what\nevidence am I talking about?\nWell, for one thing,\nwomen who have affairs,\nand this is about 70% of them.\n- Again, sorry, just, I want to make sure.\nOf women who have affairs.\n- So let's say, ballpark,\nKinsey was, let's say roughly right,\n25-26% of women will have affairs.\nLet's just assume that he's right.\nAnd we don't know exactly,\nbut of the women who do have affairs,\nabout 70% say they have fallen in love\nwith their affair partner.\nThey become deeply emotionally involved\nwith their affair partner.\nAnd to me,\nif you're just trying to\nget good genes from a guy,\nthat is the last thing you want to do\nis fall in love with them\nor get emotionally involved,\nbut it's very compatible if\nyou want to switch mates.\nAnd so that's sort of,\nthat's one piece of evidence\nthat suggests that women,\nthe mate switching function of infidelity\nis a more likely explanation.\nNow, these two are not inherently\nincompatible hypotheses.\nIn other words,\nit's possible that some women\ndo pursue a dual mating\nstrategy hypothesis,\nbut there's other evidence that suggests,\nso for example,\nwhat are the actual rates\nof genetic cuckoldry?\nWell in the modern environment\nanyway, they're pretty low.\nIt turns out they're like 2-3%.\n- Could you just explain for the audience\nwhat genetic cuckoldry is?\n- So this is where the woman,\nwhere the man believes he is\nthe genetic father of a child,\nbut it turns out he's not,\nmight be the mailman or\nthe next door neighbor\nor the guy she's having an affair with.\nSo mistaken paternity\nand genetic cuckoldry is\njust one way to capture it.\n- Named after the cuckoo bird, right?\n- Named after the cuckoo bird, yeah.\n- Who sneaks its eggs into\nthe nest of the other,\ndestroys the future offspring of the bird,\nand then basically offloads\nall the work onto another.\n- Right.\n- Father.\n- Parasitizes, yeah\nthe parental investment\nof different bird species.\nSo anyway,\nso I think that,\nand there's other sources of\nevidence that I think points,\nso one of the sources of evidence\nthat initially seemed to support\nthe dual mating strategy\nhypothesis was ovulation shifts.\nSo in other words,\nit looked like from the early studies\nthat when women are ovulating,\nthese are among non-pill-taking women,\nwomen not on hormonal contraceptives,\nthat they experienced a preference shift\ntoward more men who were\nmasculine and symmetrical,\nwhich were hypothesized\nmarkers for good genes.\nAnd there's an explanation for that,\nbut it turns out the effects of ovulation\non women's mate preferences are far weaker\nthan the initial studies looked like.\nAnd in fact,\nsome larger scale studies\nhave failed to replicate them entirely.\nAnd so that was one of the\nkey sources of evidence.\nThese ovulation shifts\nthat women were going after the genes,\nbecause it's only when she's ovulating,\nand she can get pregnant by\nhaving sex with another man\nthat it would make sense for her\nto have sex with another man.\nAnd there was even some early evidence\nthat women were timing their affairs,\ntiming sex with their affair partners\nto coincide with when they were ovulating.\nBut, as I said,\nsome of these subsequent studies\nhave failed to replicate\nthese early findings,\ncalling into question the\ndual mating strategy notion.\nAnd so I've shifted my views on this,\nand now endorse the mate\nswitching hypothesis\nas a more likely explanation\nfor why most women have affairs.\n- The way you describe\nthis makes me wonder if,\nof the women that have affairs,\ndo those affairs tend\nto be more long lasting\nthan the affairs that men have,\nbecause the way you describe it,\nas men are seizing an opportunity\nto sort of a carpe diem\ntype approach to infidelity,\nand women potentially on average,\nare capitalizing on something\nthat is longer term.\nNow, of course, if they're\ndoing this around ovulation,\nthen it would constrain\nthe amount of times\nthey would need to see or have sex with\nthis other person that\nthey're not married to.\nBut is there any evidence\nthat women have more ongoing affairs\nand men have more transient affairs?\n- Yeah, there is.\nAnd so if you look at\npeople who have affairs,\nthere's a sex difference there.\nSo that women tend to have\naffairs with one person,\nand become emotionally involved\nwith that one person over time.\nMen who have affairs tend to have affairs\nwith a larger number of affair partners.\nAnd so, which then by definition,\ncan't be long lasting.\nYou can't have long-term affairs\nwith six different partners.\n- Unless he's juggling multiple\nphone accounts or something.\n- Right, right.\nAnd some men try to do that,\nbut I think it could be very taxing.\n- Yeah, and in this day and age,\nit's easier to meet more people\nby virtue of online communications,\nbut it's also easier to get caught,\nmeaning it's harder to\nconceal interactions.\nEverything's in the cloud anyway.\nA good friend of mine\nwho is former very high\nlevel in special operations,\nsaid anything that's not in\nyour head and only in your head\nis available for others to\nfind, should they want it,\nand I think that's largely true.\n- Yeah so,\nphone information, text messages,\nand people are very good\nat hacking into their\npartners' phones, computers.\nAnd then also there are\nvideo cameras everywhere.\nSo sneaking off to this\nquiet restaurant, I mean,\nthere are probably eight video cameras\nthat can record you walking\nin and out of that restaurant.\n- Everything can be found.\nI'm certain of that.\nYou mentioned emotional affairs\nand financial infidelity, as well.\nI had a girlfriend once who,\nas a early date discussion said,\nnot that I get the\nimpression that you are,\nbut I want to be very clear.\nShe said, that you are not emotionally,\nphysically or financially\ntied to any other women.\nAnd I thought it was very interesting\nthat now you bring up\nfinancial infidelity.\nShe's quite happily partnered\nnow and not with me, but,\nbut it's interesting, it's the first time\nI heard anyone spell it\nout that way as a list,\nalmost like specific aims in a grant.\nWhat is emotional infidelity?\nWhat is financial infidelity?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nWell, this is a very smart woman,\nshe tapped into all three.\nSo, and I assumed you\ngave honest responses\nto all of those three questions.\n- As I recall I did, but as we now know,\nyou can ask her at some point.\n- Right, right.\n- And there is self deception\nin the service of deception\nthat is another issue.\nSo emotional infidelity is basically\nexactly what it sounds like.\nIt's falling in love with someone else,\nbecoming psychologically\nclose to someone else,\nsharing intimate or private\ninformation with someone else.\nThat's what I mean by\nemotional infidelity.\nAnd one of the hallmarks of this\nis a study done by a\nformer student of mine,\nBarry Cooley, it was\nvery clever I thought.\nHe analyzed, there used to be\nthis reality TV show called Cheaters,\nwhere they would hire detectives,\nand they would, when the\ndetective would like,\nsay follow someone to a hotel room,\nthey'd call up the partner and say,\nyour husband just walked\ninto the hotel room\nwith someone else.\nWould you like to come down\nto the hotel and confront him?\nAnd a certain percentage\nof people would confront,\nand what he analyzed,\nso he analyzed all these episodes\nof this show called Cheaters.\nAnd what he examined was\nthe verbal interrogations\nwhen people confronted their partners.\nAnd when men confronted their partners,\nthe first question they want to know is,\ndid you fuck him?\nWomen, their first question\nwas, do you love her?\nAnd so this kind of\ncaptures that difference\nbetween sexual infidelity\nand emotional infidelity,\nand also kind of captures\nanother sex difference\nwhen it comes to sexual\njealousy, you know,\nwhere men tend to be more focused\non the sexual components\nof the infidelity,\nbecause those are what compromise\nhis paternity certainty,\nhis certainty that he's\nactually the genetic father\nof whatever offspring ensue,\nwhereas love is a cue to, do you love her?\nThat's a cue that he's going\nto leave you, the woman,\nfor another woman,\nas a cue that,\nto the long-term loss of that investment\nand commitment from that partner.\nAnd so the sexes seem to differ\nin which aspects of the infidelity,\nwith women were attuned\nto or more upset by\nthe emotional infidelity,\nmen, more by the sexual infidelity.\nNow, financial infidelity\nhas been explored much less,\nbut in my new book, When Men Behave Badly,\nI have a section on financial infidelity,\nwhere I summarize all the\nresearch that has been done.\nAnd I was kind of flabbergasted\nby the percentage of people\nwho do things like have credit cards\nthat their spouse doesn't know about,\nkeep secret bank accounts,\nhave the credit card bills\nmailed to their office\nrather than their home,\nhave basically resources and expenditures\nof pooled resources that\nthey keep from their partner,\nand both sexes do it.\nAnd the percentages vary\nfrom study to study,\nbut they range from like\n30 to 60% of all people\nwho are keeping financial information\nfrom their spouse in one way or another.\nIt could be the woman's\nout buying designer purses,\nor designer handbags.\nIt could be the guys\nout going to strip clubs\nor taking his affair\npartner to restaurants,\nand doesn't want those charges\nto show up on, you know,\na jointly held credit card.\nSo financial infidelity is critical.\nAnd then even things like\ndiverting pooled resources\nto one set of genetic\nrelatives versus another set\nis another thing that\npeople tend to keep secret.\nSo there are forms of\nfinancial infidelity, as well.\nSo, yeah, infidelity, you're absolutely,\nit's a great question,\nbecause it shouldn't be\nconfined to sexual infidelity,\nwhich is what most people think about,\nbut also emotional and financial.\nInterestingly, if you ask people,\nwhat is infidelity in a marriage?\nMen tend to say, well, it's obvious\nas she has sex with someone\nelse, that's infidelity.\nWhereas women are more likely\nto have a broader\ndefinition of infidelity.\nThey will cite things\nlike emotional infidelity,\nfinancial infidelity, as\npart of the definition.\nWhereas men have that\nmore narrow definition.\n- Interesting.\nI have a good friend\nwho's a couples counselor,\na clinical psychologist,\nand she told me something\ninteresting that relates to this,\nwhich is that in cases of infidelity,\noftentimes some of the\narguments between couples\nboil down to whether or not\ncontraception was used or not.\nThat becomes a key feature,\nand she always thought\nthat that was, you know,\nhoming in on a detail,\nwhich of course is an important detail\nas it relates to both\npaternity issues and pregnancy,\nbut also disease, right.\nBut as we're talking about all this,\nit makes me think that\nthis may have deeper\nevolutionary roots in our,\nfurther down in the brain,\nas we say in neuroscience literature.\n- And yeah,\nusing a condom versus not using a condom,\nnot using is a more intimate act in a way,\nyou were literally\nphysically more intimate\nwith someone else,\nthan if you do use a condom.\nBut whether evolutionary roots to this,\nI don't know, I mean condoms\nare probably relatively recent,\nor at least the widespread use of them\nare relatively recent\nin evolutionary time.\nSo I doubt we have adaptation\nspecifically for them.\n- No, and presumably before condoms,\nthat one can only speculate\nbecause as we say,\nwhen it comes to behavior,\nthere's rarely a fossil record,\nbut sometimes there is,\nit would be the withdrawal\nmethod of contraception,\nwhich a good friend of mine who studies,\nwhose laboratory works\non reproductive biology,\nsays the reason that's a\npoor choice of contraception\nis because it was designed not to work.\nSo note to those trying to\navoid unwanted pregnancy.\nSo we talked a little bit about status\nin terms of what men and\nwomen are selecting for,\nfor different types of relationships.\nIs there anything else about status\nthat you find particularly\ninteresting, and you know,\nwhat men are finding attractive\nbesides these, you know,\nwaist to hip ratios and\nquality of potential mothers\nand so forth.\nAre there any kind of a\nhidden gems in the literature\naround this that I\nmight not have heard of?\n- Well, yeah.\nSo you mean among,\nthings like sex differences\nin what leads to high status?\n- For instance, or what,\nor perhaps things that are surprising\nin terms of what people are selecting for.\nDo people even know what\nthey're selecting for?\nOr is this all subconscious?\nAny and all of those topics\nare of interest to me.\n- So we'll have to take\nthem in reverse order.\nYou know, I think a\nlot of it is conscious,\nbut some of it is certainly unconscious,\nor there are elements which\nare totally unconscious.\nSo I mentioned one earlier\nwhere a man looks at a woman,\nhe's not, he's aware that\nhe's attracted to her\nand attracted to her physical appearance,\nbut he might not be aware of why.\nWe didn't evolve to be aware of why,\njust like with food preferences,\nwe find certain things delectable\nand other things nauseating,\nwe don't understand the adaptive logic\nof why our food preferences\nexist and why we have them.\nAnd the same is true of mating, you know?\nAnd so men find women with a\nlow waist-hip ratio attractive,\nbut they might not, they almost rarely,\nrarely will they know, oh,\nlow waist ratio is actually associated\nwith higher fertility, lower\nendocrinological problems,\nlower age, et cetera.\nSo, we're sometimes aware of what we want,\nbut we are unaware of why we want it.\nSo, there are unconscious elements\nthat the whole topic of status\nand what leads to high\nstatus or low status,\nit's a topic I'm currently investigating,\npublished a couple\nscientific articles on it.\nAnd so maybe we'll hold off on that\nfor a future discussion,\nbut it intersects, I'll mention one,\nit intersects with mating\nin interesting ways,\nin that higher status\ngives people the ability to choose\nfrom a wider pool of potential mates\nthan they would if they have low status.\nAnd so one of the reasons\nthat people strive for status\nis because they have access\nto more desirable mates.\nConversely,\nhaving desirable mates endows\nyou with higher status.\nAnd so if you have,\nif you're a male,\nyou have a very attractive\nwoman on your arm\nthat leads to high status.\nAnd so there's a reciprocal link\nbetween status and mating in that way.\nAnd there've been studies where,\nsay they pose a kind\nof an unattractive guy,\nolder unattractive guy, and\na stunningly beautiful woman\nas his girlfriend.\nAnd they say, well,\nwhat's this guy all about?\nAnd they say, oh, he must\nbe very high in status.\nHe must be very wealthy.\nHe must have a lot going for him,\nwhereas the reverse people don't\nmake the same attributions.\nAnd so there is an\ninteresting reciprocal link\nbetween status and mating success,\nwhere mating success leads to high status,\nand high status leads\nto more mating success.\n- Over and over again,\nthere are these instances\nthat you describe\nwhere the assessment of potential mates,\nsexual or long-term partnership,\nare being made in the contents\nof good statistical practices,\nlooking at the choices of others\nas a readout of your own choices.\nThis seems to be a theme\nthat this is not being made\nin a very narrow context,\nbut paying attention to what other people\nare paying attention to.\nIt seems to come up again and again.\nSlightly off center from that,\nbut still paying attention to what\nother people are paying attention to.\nWhat's known about jealousy\nin men versus women?\nAnd how frequent it is, how intense it is,\nand what people do with that jealousy.\nI mean, we hear,\nor I've heard at some point that\na large fraction of homicides\nare the consequence of jealous lovers.\nThat's the darkest angle of all this,\nbut in evolutionary psychology\ncontext, what is jealousy?\nDoes it relate to paternity issues only?\nWhat can you tell us about jealousy?\nYeah, that's great set of questions,\nand when I first started\nstudying jealousy,\nI reviewed all the prior\npublications on jealousy.\nAnd at that time,\njealousy was regarded\nas a sign of immaturity,\na sign of insecurity,\na sign of a neurosis or pathology,\nor in some cases delusion.\nAnd what I argued is,\nand do argue, is that\njealousy is an evolved emotion\nthat serves several\nadaptive functions, okay?\nOne of which you mentioned\nis a paternity certainty function.\nBut to back up a second,\nbasically, once you have the evolution\nof long-term mating, long-term pair bonds,\nyou're talking about\nfrom a male perspective,\ninvesting a tremendous amount\nof resources in a woman\nand her children over years or decades,\neven with boomerang kids now,\nit may go more than two decades.\n- Boomerang kids?\n- Kids who leave home and then\ncome back and live at home.\n- That happens?\n- Oh yeah, that happens.\n- I don't have children.\n- Okay yeah, no that's a big thing.\n- But if I do I'll just\nexpect that they'll come back.\n- They'll come back because\nthey can't find a job,\nor they find it cheaper\nto live at the parent's\nhouse, or whatever.\n- Oh, goodness.\nI can't think of anything worse.\nI mean, I love my parents.\n- I know, I can't imagine,\nbut it happens and it's\nhappening more and more,\ngiven the current economic situation.\nBut, so once you have long-term mating,\nyou need a defense\nto prevent or preserve the investment\nthat you've made and are\nmaking in long-term mateship.\nAnd so jealousy serves this\nmate guarding function,\nif you will, or mate retention function.\nSo in other words, one\nway of phrasing this,\nis that we know that they are affairs,\nwe know that people break\nup, they get divorced,\nbut people have adaptations\nto want to hold on to their mates, okay?\nAnd that's what jealousy's in part about.\nAnd so jealousy gets activated\nwhen there are threats\nto that romantic relationship.\nAnd there are other forms of jealousy,\nlike sibling jealousy and so forth,\nbut we're focusing on mating\njealousy in this context.\nSo now what's interesting\nis that the threats\nto an ongoing, valued\nromantic relationship\ncome from many sources.\nSo they could be,\nyou detect cues to your\npartner's infidelity,\nor cues of a lack of an emotional distance\nbetween you and your partner.\nYou say, I love you to your partner,\nand your partner says,\nI wonder how the hell the Knicks are doing\nthis scoring season, or whatever.\nIf you get an unreciprocated\nI love you is a bad cue.\n- Or a half, or some people\nare so tuned to this,\nif there's a half millisecond delay,\nthey can detect delays in responses.\n- Yes, yeah.\nDelays in responses, but even things like,\nso that's one set of cues,\nbut then there's another set\nof interested mate poachers.\nSo, you know, if you're mated\nto someone who's desirable,\nwhich many people are, other\npeople still desire them,\nand so sometimes try to poach them,\nor lure them away from you\nfor a short term sexual encounter,\nor for a longer term relationship.\nAnd so we have to be, so\njealousy motivates people\nto be attentive to potential mate poachers\nin their environment,\nbut even more subtle things\nlike mate value discrepancies\ncan trigger jealousy.\nSo even if there are no mate poachers\nand no accused infidelity,\nif a mate value discrepancy\nopens up in a relationship.\nSo in the American system,\nlike you're a six or an eight or a ten,\nand people generally pair off\nbased on similarity and mate value.\n- So that tends to happen,\nsixes end up with sixes,\nsevens end up with\nsixes, plus or minus one.\nThese are somewhat subjective scales.\n- Somewhat subjective,\nbut there's still some\nconsensus about these things.\nSo even colloquially people,\ncolloquially people say things like,\nhe's not good enough for you, you know,\nor I think you could do better to people\nwho implicitly have a notion\nof relative mate value\nand discrepancies therein,\nbut discrepancies can open up\nwhere none previously existed.\nSo you get fired from a job.\nAll of a sudden, you know,\nand most people are very understanding\nand forgiving about that,\nif it's not too long, but you\ngo six months, eight months,\npeople start having problems,\nor if someone's career takes off.\nLet's say a woman becomes\na famous singer or actress,\nor a man does, career takes off.\nAll of a sudden there's\na mate value discrepancy\nwhere you have access to a\nlarger pool of potential mates\nand higher mate value potential mates.\nSo, people are attentive to\nmate value discrepancies.\nAnd so jealousy can get activated,\neven if there are no immediate\nthreats to a relationship,\nbut the mate value discrepancy is a threat\nthat looms on the horizon\nof the relationship,\nbecause we know statistically\nthe higher mate value person\nis more likely to have an\naffair and is more likely\nto dump the other person and\ntrade up in the mating market.\n- And when people find new partners\nfor long-term relationships,\ndo they tend to trade up?\n- On average yes,\nif the discrepancy is sufficiently large,\nso there are costs\nassociated with breaking up,\ndivorcing for example, I\nmean, it's emotionally,\nfinancially, it's a costly thing.\nAnd so if you have like a half a point\nmate value discrepancy,\nyou're not going to see a lot\nof breakups, but you know,\nif you have larger mate\nvalue discrepancies,\nthat's going to augur more for\ntrading up in the mating market.\nSo, then you get into,\nso what jealousy is,\nit's an emotion that gets\nactivated by these circumstances.\nAnd then what people do about it\ndepends on what their options are.\nAnd people do things that I,\nin my published scientific work,\nI say range from vigilance to violence.\nSo this whole spectrum of things.\nIn fact, I've identified\n19 different tactics\nthat people use to deal with\nproblems once they get jealous,\nand one is increased vigilance,\nand the other extreme violence.\n- Vigilance for the behavior of the mate.\n- Yeah, vigilance for\nthe behavior of the mate.\nAnd that can include stalking, following,\nhacking into iPhones or computers,\nmonitoring the behavior of mate poachers,\nlooking at eye contact between\nother men and your partner.\nThere's a whole suite\nof things that you know,\nis involved in vigilance.\nAnd then at the other extreme,\nand we can talk about things in between,\nbut the other extreme is violence.\nAnd so in my new book,\nWhen Men Behave Badly,\nI have a whole chapter on\nintimate partner violence.\nAnd this is what I argue,\nand this is really unfortunate,\nand I'm not endorsing it.\nIt's illegal, it's bad, don't do it.\nBut people will engage\nin intimate partner violence in America,\nsomething like 28 to 30% of\nall people who are married\nwill experience intimate partner violence\nin their relationships, so\nit's not a trivial percentage.\n- And that violence is\nbetween the two partners.\n- Between the two partners, yes.\nThere's also violence that gets directed\nto our potential mate poachers,\nbut that's a somewhat separate issue.\nBut one of the things that is\nfunctional about the violence\nis that it tends to reduce\nperceived mate value discrepancies.\nSo in other words,\nguys tend to engage in the\nviolence more than women do,\nalthough some argue that there's more\nequality in the violence,\nbut at a minimum men\ntend to do more damage\nwhen they do the violence.\n- And when you're talking about violence,\nis this ever emotional violence?\n- Yeah, there there's that as well.\nAnd in fact, the two\ntend to be correlated.\nSo in my studies of married couples,\nverbal violence is a good predictor\nof physical violence happening as well.\nSo one of the things that'll happen,\njust to give a concrete example,\nguys will start insulting\ntheir partner's appearance.\nYou're really looking ugly today.\nYour thighs are heavy or, you know,\nyou're not looking very good,\nso they try to denigrate\nthe woman's appearance,\nwhich is a key component\nof woman's mate value.\n- So they're trying to adjust more closely\nthe mate value discrepancy.\n- Yeah, they're trying\nto reduce her perceived,\nself-perceived mate value.\nSo if, let's say he's\na six, she's an eight,\nand he can convince her that\nshe's actually only a six,\nthen she's going to be more\nlikely to stay with him.\n- Very diabolical.\n- It's terribly diabolical.\nBut the fact is women don't\nfeel good about themselves\nwhen they get beaten up by their partner.\nIn fact, in the cases where\nit leaves physical evidence,\nwomen wear sunglasses or\nturtlenecks or cover up,\nthe bruises is it literally\ndoes lower the mate value\nof the woman by injuring\nher physical appearance.\n- And getting her to conceal\nherself, stay home, et cetera.\nYeah, taking her out of the,\nthe literally reducing her visibility.\n- Right, and that's actually\none of the predictors of violence,\nis if he starts doing\nthings other than violence,\nlike cutting off her relationships\nwith her friends and her family,\ntrying to sequester her,\nand prevent her from getting exposed\nto potential other partners.\nAnd so it is a very diabolical,\nbut I think important\nto understand, you know,\nthe potential functionality\nof intimate partner violence.\n- What about, sorry to interrupt again,\nbut I'm just so curious.\nSo oftentimes my audience will\nsay you interrupt too often,\nbut I want to make sure that\nI don't miss an opportunity\nto ask you about the\nintimate partner violence\nin the other direction, female to male,\nwhere stereotypically speaking\nthat the opportunity for\nphysical violence is still there,\nbut the idea in mind is that it would be\nmore of a psychological nature.\nAlthough I think there is evidence\nthat some women beat their husbands,\nbut I'm guessing it's not\nas frequent or am I off?\n- Well, different studies,\nso it depends on whether you\njust simply count up acts,\nor whether you look at\nthe damage it has done.\nAnd, as I mentioned,\nmen tend to do more physical damage,\nso there are shelters for battered women\nall over the country.\nAs far as I know, there's\none for battered men.\nNow it may be,\nand this is partly true\nthat men are more ashamed\nif they get beaten up by their partner,\nclocked with a frying pan,\nand it's possible,\nand there's evidence that police\ndon't take it as seriously.\nSo there's one case\nthat I report in my book\nwhere a guy called the police,\nand his wife had clocked\nhim with something,\nand police shows up and he says,\nif she so much as broke a\nfingernail in this altercation,\nthey'll charge you and not her.\nAnd so there is a police bias,\na potential police bias in this.\nAnd so there may be under-reporting\nof women beating up men as a consequence.\nBut, the motivations are often different.\nSo one is that\nmale sexual jealousy will trigger\nhim to attack his partner,\nand then she will use physical\nviolence to defend herself.\nSo she might pick up a frying pan,\nor a weapon of some\nsort to defend herself.\nand so the motivation is his\nsexual jealousy on his part,\nbut self-defense on her part.\nAnd so that accounts for some\nunknown percentage of the\ncases, and in some cases,\nit is women who were outraged\nwhen they discover their partner's\nbeen having sex with someone else,\nan infidelity of a sexual,\nfinancial, or emotional nature.\nAnd so there is some\nfemale to male violence\nthat absolutely occurs.\nBut the reduction of a\nperceived mate value discrepancy\nis a key function from male perspective.\nAgain, not that he thinks about this,\nhe's just angry and\nwants to hurt her, okay?\nOkay, but here's one other\nthing that is really interesting\nabout the intimate partner violence,\nand that's the specificity of\nit depending on circumstances,\nand namely, when the woman gets pregnant,\nshe's more vulnerable\nto physical violence,\nand when the man suspects\nthat he's not the father\nof that pregnancy,\nhe's more likely to direct the violence\ntoward blows to her abdomen.\nIt's that specific.\nAnd so in that case the function\nis hypothesized function,\nis to terminate the\npregnancy by a rival male,\nas opposed to deterring the woman\nfrom committing an infidelity,\nor from leaving the relationship entirely.\nSo that's why one function\nof intimate partner violence,\nis just sequestering the woman\nand keeping her all to himself.\nSo it's both to prevent infidelity\nand to prevent defection.\n- I have a friend whose\nwife told me\nthat if he cheats I'll kill him,\nthat's what she said,\nbut it's actually just much easier\nto keep him very, very busy.\nAnd that statement now leaps to mind,\nbecause of what you're describing,\nthat there are many\ntactics by which people\ncan engage this effort to reduce\nthe mate value discrepancy,\nnot all of which are overtly violent,\nbut all of which are designed\nto constrain their behavior.\n- Right, right.\nYeah, so these would fall under\nwhat I would call mate retention tactics,\nand only one or two of which\nfall under the violence category.\nYeah, they're even, yeah,\nwithin partner psychological manipulations\nabout these things.\nSo there are psychological manipulations\nabout perceived mate value,\nno one else would want you,\nyou're a loser there's\ndenigration of partner\nwithin the relationship,\neven feigning anger to make the partner\nfeel guilty about say,\nlooking at someone else.\nSo there's all kinds of\ninter nesting warfare\nthat goes on within relationships\nto manipulate perceptions of these things.\nThis is, I'm creating\na much too jaded view\nof romance and love, I think.\n- Oh no, we will get to the happy endings.\nI mean, there are certainly many\nhappy relationships out there.\nAs a neuroscientist, I hear about this,\nand the immediacy of\nhow people fall into\na pattern or jealousy,\nor a pattern of cheating and, not always,\nit just speaks to a brain circuitry\nthat's evolved to protect something.\nAnd I'm sure this statement\nis not exhaustive,\nbut I think it's accurate\nto say that every species,\nbut especially humans,\nwants to make more of itself\nand protect its young,\nbut these issues of paternity\nand resource allocation,\nI think they're vital.\nYeah, I look forward to a day\nwhere evolutionary\npsychology and neuroscience\ncan merge at the level\nof underlying mechanism.\nBut I don't think it's dark,\nI think it's just the way\nwe're wired at some level.\nSpeaking of dark, could you\ntell us about the dark triad?\n- Yeah, so the dark triad,\nso we've been talking about\nsex differences on average,\nbut there are critical within-sex\nindividual differences,\nand the dark triad is one\nof the most important ones.\nThe dark triad consists\nof three personality characteristics,\nso narcissism, Machiavellianism,\nand psychopathy.\nHallmarks of narcissism are\nthings like grandiosity,\nthe person thinks that\nthey're more intelligent,\nmore attractive, more dazzling,\nmore charming than they actually are.\nThe think they're the greatest\nperson since sliced bread.\nImportantly, with narcissism,\nyou also get a sense of entitlement.\nSo they feel entitled to\na larger share of the pie,\nwhether that be the financial pie,\nthe status pie, or the sexual pie.\nMachiavellianism is high scorers\ntend to pursue an\nexploitative social strategy.\nSo they might feign\ncooperation, but then cheat,\nyou know, on subsequent moves.\nThey view other people as\npawns to be manipulated\nfor their own instrumental gains.\nAnd then psychopathy, one of\nthe hallmarks of psychopathy\nis a lack of empathy.\nSo most people have a\nnormal empathy circuit\nwhere if a child falls down and gets hurt,\nwe feel compassion for the harm\nthat that person is undergoing.\nOr if a puppy gets a hit\nby a car or whatever,\nwe feel compassion, psychopaths don't.\nThat is those high on this,\nit's a dimensional thing,\nit's not a categorical thing.\nSo those high on psychopathy\nbasically lack empathy.\nAnd so if you combine these qualities,\nnarcissism, psychopathy,\nand Machiavellianism,\nyou have well, some very bad dudes.\nAnd I say bad dudes\n'cause men tend to score\nhigher on these things than women,\nespecially on the psychopathy dimension.\nSo when you talk about\nclinical levels of psychopathy,\nit's estimated to be\nsomething like 1% of women\nand about 4% of men.\nSo men are much higher on that.\nSo why is this important?\nWell, it's important\nin the mating context,\nbecause those who are\nhigh on dark triad traits\ntend to be sexual deceivers for one.\nSo they're very often very charming,\nvery good at seducing women,\nand then abandoning them sometimes with,\nafter fleecing them or\ndraining their bank account.\nThey're very good at the art of seduction,\nthey also tend to be sexual harassers,\nserial sexual harassers,\nand sexual coercers.\nSo when it comes to\nforms of sexual violence,\nhigh dark triad guys tend\nto be perpetrators of this.\nAnd so like most men I think, would be,\nfind it ethically abhorrent\nto sexually harass a\nwoman in the workplace,\ndark triad guys, in part maybe\nthey feel entitled to it,\nand in part they do.\nI mean, in some cases\nthat I report in the book,\nthere are like literal descriptions\nwhere the guys are\nwriting in these journals,\nI knew she was attracted to me.\nYou know, that's why she\nmet me in the Xerox room\njust when I was there,\n'cause she wanted to admire\nmy bulging biceps or whatever.\n- It's all about them.\n- Yeah, and they,\nand this gets into a\nbias that I talk about,\nwhich is the male sexual\nmisperception bias,\nwhere a woman smiles at a man,\nman thinks, oh, she wants my body,\nshe's attracted to me.\nAnd women are thinking, oh,\nI'm just being friendly,\nI'm being polite or professional.\nBut these guys high dark triad guys\nare more susceptible to the\nsexual over-perception bias,\nand they literally believe that the woman\nis attracted to them and\nsending them signals,\ngreen lights to sexually approach.\nAnd so if you combine dark triad traits\nwith the dispositional pursuit\nof a short-term mating strategy,\nthat's an especially deadly combination.\nThat's when you get sexual\nharassment, sexual coercion.\nSo these are very bad dudes,\nalso predictors of\nintimate partner violence.\n- What approximate frequency\nin the male population\nhave all three of the dark triad traits.\nAnd I realize that they're on a continuum,\nsociopathy, narcissism.\n- That's why you can't say\nbecause they are on a continuum,\nand it's sort of arbitrary\nwhere you draw the line.\nBut I think it's a minority of men.\nIt's a subset of men who\ncommit the vast majority\nof these acts of sexual violence.\nAnd that's why it's not like,\nif you look at victims of sexual violence,\nthey're more numerous\nthan the perpetrators of sexual violence,\nbecause the perpetrators tend to be\nserial offenders, so to speak.\nOne guy in the workplace,\nharassing 15 different women,\none guy sexually coercing,\nyou know, multiple women.\nThat's why you have like, in\nwell-known cases in the news,\nlike Harvey Weinstein, you know,\nprobably over a hundred different women,\nBill Cosby, Jeffrey Epstein,\nsome of these more famous cases,\nthese are a large number of victims,\nbut pretty much [indistinct]\nthe perpetrators.\nAnd there's no question that these guys\nlike Harvey Weinstein and Jeffrey Epstein\nwere definitely high on dark triad traits.\n- You mentioned stalking briefly.\nMaybe we could just talk about\nsome of the less known\nfeatures about stalking.\nI think I once heard you\ngive a lecture where you said\nthat one of the scariest\nthings about stalking\nis that sometimes it works.\n- Yes, yeah.\nSo, well stalking has\nmultiple motivations,\nbut one of the most frequent motivations\nis a mating motivation,\nwhere either there's a breakup\nand the woman dumps the guy\nand the guy doesn't want to get dumped,\nhe wants to maintain a\nrelationship with her.\nAnd I should say that,\nwhen it comes to criminal stalking,\nthere's a huge sex difference.\nAbout 80% of the stalkers tend\nto be men, about 20% women.\nSo there are women stalkers, but they're,\nabout a fourth of the\nnumber compared to men.\nSo the motivation of the guys tends to be\neither an attempt to get\nback together with the woman,\neither sexually or in a relationship or,\nand/or to interfere with\nher future mating prospects.\nAnd it works in some of\nthe time in two senses.\nOne is it does interfere\nwith her attempts to remate.\nSo in fact, it scares off some guys.\nSo like you show up and pick\nup a woman at her apartment\nfor a date and her ex is sitting\nout there glaring at you.\n- Or, I'm actually familiar\nwith the circumstance\nwhere early in a relationship,\nsomebody mentions that an ex has made\nveiled threats about\nsurveillance, for instance.\nI've actually had that happen\nseveral times in my dating history\nwhere someone would say,\nyou started opening up\nabout previous relationships a little bit,\nas it's appropriate, and someone says,\nyeah, you know, he mentioned\nthat he was going to, you know,\nsend someone around to, you\nknow, to surveil me, you know,\nthat kind of thing,\nwhich is a very interesting\nfactoid to pick up.\nBut I heard it enough times,\nand people I know have reported\nhearing this enough times\nthat I'm guessing that that's\nprobably more frequent than\npeople actually trailing people\nin cars and things of that sort.\nBut planting that,\nit's like the psychological\nseed of surveillance\nis a form of harassment in some sense.\n- Yes, absolutely.\nI think that you're right,\nthere's that planting\nthe psychological seeds,\nbut then also with surveillance,\nsome surveilers remain hidden,\nso you don't know necessarily.\n- Yeah, I confess in this case,\nit did not act as a deterrent\nfor continuing the relationship,\nbut that's another story.\nSo, how often do women respond?\nI have to put this in quotes\nfor those that are listening,\nair quotes end quotes,\npositively to stalk.\nI mean, how often does it work\nto re-secure the partner after\nthey've been broken up with.\n- So in our studies,\nit's a minority of cases\nthat it works to reestablish.\nI think something like 15%\nof the time that it works,\neither to temporarily reestablish\na sexual relationship,\nor lure the woman back in for\na more permanent relationship.\nSo most of the time it doesn't work.\nBut one woman in our study said,\nthe guy, every time she\nwent out with another guy,\nhe would threaten the other guy.\nAnd she said after about six months,\nthere were no other guys.\nHe basically scared\noff all the other guys.\nAnd so she went back to him\nbecause there were no other guys around.\n- Yeah, I experienced this\nwhen I was in college,\nI lived in a small town,\nvery population dense.\nIsla Vista, UC Santa Barbara.\nAnd there was a couple\nwhere every time this\nwoman would date someone,\nhe'd basically beat up\nwhoever the new suitor was.\nAnd pretty soon no one would go near them.\nThey got a reputation as the\nkind of Sid and Nancy couple,\nand indeed it worked,\nit worked in the sense that\nno one dare go near her\nand they ended up together.\nSo I've seen real life examples of this.\n- Yeah, so it happens,\nbut it is in general,\nnot a successful strategy.\n- Oh no, and that's not\nwhat I'm suggesting.\nI was just shocked to learn that,\n'cause we hear stalking and we have this,\nthere's one very extreme image of it.\nBut the underlying motivations I think,\nreveal something about mating dynamics.\n- Yeah, and I think that the circumstances\nare often a mate value discrepancy\nwhere the guy realizes correctly\nthat he will be unable to replace her\nwith a mate of equivalent mate value,\nor in some cases any\nmate, you know, it's like,\nwell she was with me once,\nmaybe I can get her back with me again.\nSo the psychology is very understandable,\nbut it tends not to work because,\nand then the other thing we found,\nwe did a study of 2,500\nvictims of stalking.\nThis is with Josh Duntley,\na former student of mine,\nwho's now a professor in\nthe criminology department.\nAnd what we found is there were large sex,\nlarge differences between the stalker\nand the victim of the stalker,\nwhere the stalker tends to be much lower\nin mate value than the victim.\nAnd so basically it's typically the woman\nwho realizes she can do a lot\nbetter on the mating market,\nand the guy realizes I\nam never going to be able\nto replace her with a woman\nof equivalent mate value.\nAnd so I'm going to use this\nlast ditch desperate measure\nto try to get her back,\nand occasionally it works.\n- I'm thinking more about\nthis mate value thing,\nthis number, this metric,\nthe eight, ten, six,\nwhatever it is.\nAnd mate value discrepancy\nplaying such a strong role\nin all these dynamics.\nI should have asked this earlier,\nbut what is the impact on mate value\nperceived or real of a woman\nhaving already had children?\nYou know, for instance, there,\nfriends of mine who are\nmarried and divorced\nwho have children,\nwill often post pictures of themselves\nwith their children in\ntheir online profiles,\nbecause it shows a strong\nsense of paternal instinct.\nYou know, there's the puppy thing.\nPeople with dogs or puppies demonstrating\na capacity to care, and for caretaking.\nIn women, the opposite is also true.\nWomen with children show capacity,\nit demonstrates fertility,\nat least at one point,\nperhaps fertility that's still present.\nDoes it positively, negatively,\nor neutrally impact a woman\nto already have children\nwhen seeking another mate,\nregardless of whether\nor not she was married\nor had the children out of wedlock?\n- As a general rule,\nit decreases for mate value,\nbecause kids with another mate\nare viewed as a cost, not a benefit.\nAnd there are costs on\nmultiple dimensions,\none of which they're going\nto be a cost to the guy,\nbecause he's going to\nhave to invest resources,\ntime, attention, so forth,\nbut also a portion of\nher effort and resources\nare going to be devoted toward kids\nwho are not genetically related to him.\nAnd which is one reason why step families,\nthere's often a lot of\nconflict within step families,\nvery explicable from an\nevolutionary perspective.\nSo in general, it's a cost, not a benefit.\nSometimes it can be a benefit though.\nSo I know one case where\na woman got divorced,\nshe had two kids and she\nended up successfully mating\nwith a guy who was also divorced\nand had primary custody of his two kids.\nAnd so there was a compatibility there,\nbut as a general rule,\nit will decrease a woman's\nand a man's mate value\nto have kids, especially\nkids who are financially,\nwho are young and financially dependent.\nBut, what happens is, let's say the woman\nwould be an eight without kids,\na guy who's a six might\nbe able to attract her\nand might feel lucky to attract her,\nbecause there's no way\nhe would've been able\nto attract her under other conditions.\nBut that's why the display of effort,\ninvesting in her kids,\nis often a mating tactic.\nHe's showing, okay, I'm\nwilling to invest in kids.\nI'm willing to sacrifice.\nAnd so they in essence become\nequivalent in mate value\nas a result of that.\nBut will she be able\nto attract on average,\nother eights, less likely,\nbut the same is true of guys.\nAnd this is why the reason\nthat it affects women more than men\nis because more custody\ntends to go with women.\nThat is the kids,\nwomen tend to have greater custody,\nand women tend to invest more in the kids\nthroughout their lives.\nNow, there are other things like alimony\nand child support payments, and so forth,\nbut all the women I've talked to,\nI've talked one-on-one\nwith many women about this.\nThey view a guy with kids\nas a cost, not a benefit,\nunless the kids are old\nenough and they've left home,\nand are no longer a financially dependent.\n- And everything you just\ndescribed is consistent\nwith what you said earlier,\nwhich is that with subsequent marriages,\nor as men get older,\nthe tendency is to seek mates\nthat are progressively younger?\n- Right.\n- Because there's a\nhigher, lower probability\nthey'll already have children,\nif they're much younger.\n- Right, right.\nAnd if the guy's successful,\nif he has status and resources\nand has other qualities\nassociated with higher mate value,\nthen he will remain\nattractive to younger women.\n- I realize it's not your\nspecific area of expertise,\nbut these days there's a lot of discussion\nabout how early childhood\nattachment to parents\ninfluences mate choice later on,\nthis kind of general\ncategorization of avoidant\nand anxious and anxious avoidant\nand all this kind of thing.\nAnd again, putting my hat on\nas a neuroscientist, I think,\nyou know, it makes sense\nthat the neural circuits\nfor attachment in\nchildhood would be somehow,\npartially or in whole,\nrepurposed for other forms of attachment.\nWe don't just tend to say, okay,\nthat brain circuitry was\nfrom when I was a kid\nand now I'm an adult,\nand so I'll develop this\nnew attachment circuitry.\nI'm guessing it evolves and whatnot,\nbut is there anything\ninteresting about that,\nabout childhood attachment strategies\nvis-a-vis stability of\nlong-term partner choice,\nor is that too big of a\nleap for us to make here?\n- Yeah well, I mean,\nI can offer some sort of\ninformed speculation about it,\nand as you point, it's\nnot my area of expertise,\nbut I know a little bit about it,\nand I mean, I think that,\nyou know, a secure attachment style,\nif both partners have a\nsecure attachment style,\nthat's conducive to a longterm mateship.\nAvoidant attachment styles,\navoidant people tend to have\nmore difficulty with intimacy\nand also higher probability of infidelity,\nand anxious attachment style,\nI don't know, can create\nproblems of its own, you know,\nin the overly clingy dependent, you know,\nabsorbing what I call\nhigh relationship load.\nSo, you know,\nthere's like mutation load,\nwhich we all have a certain\nnumber of mutations.\nThere's parasite load.\nThere's also what I\ncall relationship loads.\nSo what is the baggage that someone brings\nto the relationship?\n- Probably correlated with\nthe frequency of demand\nof immediate text message responses.\nWell, I think that the\nfrequency of demand,\nlike the latent, the expected low latency\nof text message responses\nplays out consistently in\nrelationships, you know,\nearly on, there's a very\nlow expectation of response.\nAnd then as people get attached,\ndepending on their level of anxiety,\nif they don't hear back from\nsomebody really quickly,\nwhere the mind goes is a\nvery interesting aspect,\nyou know, do you become suspicious?\nDo you become anxious?\nCan you stabilize your\nown internal milieu,\nor do you need to see the dot\ndot dot, that's coming back?\nI'd love to see a study\non that at some point.\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, that's a good one.\nAnd my intuition suggests\nthat your prediction\nabout that would pan out.\nIt would be the insecure\nthat would really be,\nyou know, getting upset if there were,\nif there were not that\nimmediate response to the texts.\n- I have a friend,\na female friend who deliberately\nquote unquote using her language,\ntrains her potential partners\nto be comfortable with a\nvariable response latency.\nBut then I asked her if she's\ncomfortable with a variable\nresponse latency, and\nshe said, absolutely not.\nSo there's an asymmetry,\nat least in that case.\nThis is almost certainly\na more rare circumstance,\nbut I'd be remiss if I didn't ask about\nunconventional relationships.\nThese days, I don't think\nit's just by virtue of\nliving in California,\nyou hear more and more about monogamish,\nas opposed to monogamous,\nand various forms of\npolyamory that may or may not\ninclude the -amory part.\nYou know, passes and permission,\nbased on seasoned circumstance\nand prior infidelities,\nlike, okay, somebody\nhad a mishap early on,\nyou know, you have one pass, so to speak,\nand you hear this kind of\nlanguage getting thrown around.\nAnd it's intriguing to me\nbecause it seems like an effort\nto bypass some of the more,\nif you will, hardwired,\nor at least culturally\nhardwired aspects of mate choice\nand sexual partner choice.\nYou know, acknowledging jealousy,\nbut confronting it by\nallowing your partner\nto be with somebody else, for instance.\nI confess, I have friends\nwho have unconventional relationships.\nI have friends with\nconventional relationships.\nAny thoughts on the polyamory.\n- Yeah, I do have a\ncouple of thoughts on it.\nI haven't studied it extensively,\nbut I think that the\nway I would phrase it is\nthat there's an attempt to overcome\ncertain evolved\nfeatures of our mating psychology,\nbut often in the service of other aspects\nof our mating psychology.\nSo what I mean by that is this.\nSo I talk about polyamory, first of all,\nthere's a sex difference,\non average, that is,\nmen are more likely to want to initiate\na polyamorous relationship than women.\nThere are lots of exceptions.\nAnd I actually know of at least\none exception, personally,\nfriends of mine who were in\na polyamorous relationship,\nbut the motivation for men\nis that evolved desire for sexual variety.\nSo it gives him access to a\nwider variety of sex partners,\nwhich is part of our\nevolved sexual psychology,\nespecially for men.\nWomen, one motivation,\nwomen also have a desire\nfor sexual variety,\non average tends not to be\nas great as that of men,\nbut also have it.\nBut some women agree to a\npolyamorous relationship\nas a mate retention tactic.\nThat is, this guy in order to keep him,\nshe has to agree to the relationship.\nAnd so, the motivations\nfor engaging in polyamory\nare somewhat sex differentiated.\n- [Andrew] On average.\n- On average, on average,\nthere are lots of exceptions.\nSo now when it comes to sexual jealousy,\nthere is this recognition that there,\nthe way that I would frame it,\nthere's this evolved emotion where\nit triggers sexual jealousy,\nseeing your partner having sex,\nor imagining your partner having sex,\nor falling in love with someone else.\nAnd, but interestingly,\nand there haven't been studies on this,\nbut I know of this one polyamorous couple\nwhere they reported to me,\nboth of them reported to me.\nShe said she doesn't,\nit doesn't bother her\nat all if her husband,\nthey're married, has sex with other women.\nThey allow it.\nI think it's like every\nThursday night or whatever,\ndifferent couples that\nhave different rules.\nBut one time she saw him\nwalking down the street,\nhand in hand affectionately\nwith a former girlfriend\nand she got extremely jealous.\nSo because it signaled\nan emotional connection.\nSo the sexual didn't bother\nher, the emotional did.\nShe happened to be bisexual.\nAnd her partner said\nthat it really upset him\nwhen she slept with other men,\nbut it was fine if she\nslept with other women.\n- I think that's a fairly common thing\nthat among the men that I know\nthat are in polyamorous relationships,\nthat that's a fairly common statement.\n- Yeah, and so he kept trying\nthese inter-nesting manipulations,\ntrying to encourage her\nto sleep with other women,\nbut not with men.\nAnd in her case,\nencouraging him not to\nget emotionally involved\nwith other women, but the sex was okay.\nSo I think that, you know,\nI think that in the modern environment,\nwe have a very rich and complicated\nevolved mating psychology.\nAnd what we're doing in these\nnovel forms or semi-novel,\nbecause these things have a\npretty deep history themselves,\nthat we're attempting to\nmaximize some of our evolved desires\nwhile keeping quiescent\nother evolved aspects\nof our sexual psychology, like jealousy.\nSo satisfying or desire\nfor sexual variety,\nbut keeping jealousy at bay,\nand different couples\ndo it in different ways,\nso as you alluded to.\nSo I know one couple live in\nLos Angeles and the woman,\nthe woman said,\nshe gives her husband\npermission to have an affair,\nsleep with other women,\nas long it's outside of\nthe city limits of LA.\nAnd this other couple, it\nhas to be Thursday night,\nyou know, and so different\npeople have different plans.\n- Putting constraints on,\nbut the constraints are specific\nand somewhat arbitrary\nto the relationship.\n- Yeah, they're specific.\nAnd often in polyamorous relationships,\npeople talk it out,\nand come to an agreement\non what is acceptable\nand what's out of bounds.\nBut in a way, I mean,\nit, in a way it's just,\nyou know, we can't change our\nevolved sexual psychology,\nI don't think.\nWhat we can do is we can\nactivate certain elements of it,\nand keep others quiescent\nand that's all good.\nAnd in a way we do in\nthe modern environment.\nSo even to take it outside of polyamory,\npornography, okay, widely\nconsumed internet pornography,\nwhat does that do?\nWell, there's a big sex difference there.\nMen tend to consume it\na lot more than women.\nThe forms of the\npornography are different,\nbut in a way, the pornography,\nwhat it does is it parasitized\nmen's evolved desire for sexual variety.\nSo they can,\nin some sense,\npsychologically experience sexual,\na variety of different women sexually\nwithout actually doing it,\nby just looking at their computer screen.\nAnd so, in a way,\nanother way of phrasing that,\nis that we create modern\nnovel cultural inventions\nin ways that satisfy our evolved desires\nand our evolved sexual desires.\n- Yeah, it's interesting with the\nkind of explosion of online pornography.\nI have a colleague at Stanford\nin psychiatry, Anna Lembke,\nwho studies the dopamine system,\nand she mentioned two things of interest.\nOne is that not only is\nthere a tremendous variety\nof experiences that are available\nto people to view in pornography,\nbut the intensity is also quite high,\nso much so that at least for young people\nwho are observing a lot of pornography,\nit's possible, and there are\nstudies looking at this now,\nthat their brain circuits become wired\nto observing sexual acts,\nas opposed to being engaged in them,\nwhich can be extremely problematic.\nSo it's a sharp blade, so to\nspeak this pornography thing.\nIt isn't what it once was,\nand it's evolving quickly.\nVery interesting.\nSo how should one frame all this?\nSo I imagine the number\nof people listening\nare in relationships, or would\nhope to be in a relationship.\nIn terms of understanding\nwhat we are selecting for,\nconsciously or subconsciously,\nit seems like there are common themes.\nIt's people want to feel\nattractive and attracted.\nPeople want to make sure\nthat there's stability\nof the relationship.\nSo when we hear about security,\noftentimes I think of this\nkind of warm, oxytocin,\nserotonin like thing,\nbut this mate value, it seems\nso powerful in all this,\nassessing mate value.\nSo how objective are people\nabout assessing their own value\nin terms of finding,\nsecuring, and over time,\nmaintaining a relationship.\nSecuring is dynamic,\nbecause people age at different rates.\nIs there an objective\nmetric of this stuff?\nI guess you get a lot of\nstatistics about somebody's image,\nand you come up with an average value\nbased on the population,\nbut how should people assess themselves?\nBecause it seems like one of the features\nthat would be very powerful\nfor leading to happiness,\nof good partner selection,\nwith that stable,\nwhere one doesn't have to\nresort to these Machiavellian,\nor diabolical, or any of\nthese other strategies,\nwould be to be very honest with oneself.\nAnd how does one do that?\n- Yeah, great questions.\nAnd, I don't think that the\nscience all the answers,\nso a couple things.\nSo one is that I think\npeople are generally\npretty good at self-assessing mate value.\nAnd even self-esteem has been hypothesized\nto be one internal monitoring\ndevice that tracks mate value.\nSo when we get a promotion at work,\nor we get a rise in status,\nwe feel an elevated sense of self-esteem.\nWe get fired, we get\nrejected, we get ostracized,\nour self-esteem plummets.\nSo, our self-evaluation,\nI think does track mate\nvalue to some extent.\nThere are people who\noverestimate their mate value,\npeople high on narcissism in particular,\nand some people underestimate\ntheir mate value.\nAnother important element is that there's\nconsensual mate value.\nSo that is if you asked a\ngroup of a hundred people,\nthere's a fair amount of consensus\nthat this person's an\neight, that person's a six.\nBut there are also individual\ndifferences in mate value.\nSo one example is I know a woman\nwho's a professor and she\nplaces a high premium on guys\nwho are deeply steeped\nin Russian literature,\nwhich she is, so that she can have\nin-depth conversations\nabout Russian literature.\n- Note to young men,\nlearn Russian literature.\n- Well, but this is high,\nand it's a dimension of mate\nvalue that's important for her,\nbut probably not important\nfor a lot of other people.\nAnd so, whereas other\npeople let's say might be,\nlet's say you're into\nfootball or some sport,\nand the other partner\nthinks sports are stupid,\nyou know, then that's, you know,\nsomeone who's also into sports\nis going to be higher\nin mate value for you.\nSo there are these individual differences\nin components of mate\nvalue, which is good,\nbecause that means if everyone\nwere going after the same people,\nand there was total\nconsensus on mate value,\nthen there would be a\nlot of mateless people,\nand a lot of problems in the world,\nand a lot of dissatisfied people.\nSo, both are important,\nthe consensual aspects\nand the individually\ndifferentiated components of mate value.\nBut in terms of accuracy of assessment,\nthere are no good measures\nscientifically to do this,\nbecause it's sufficiently complicated.\nSo I mentioned, you know,\nwe've mentioned maybe half,\nmaybe a dozen different\ncomponents of mate value,\nphysical attractiveness,\nkindness, emotional stability,\nhealth status, et cetera.\nAnd these aren't the only ones.\nSo I teach a course on\npsychology of human mating.\nAnd I ask the people, it's a large course,\na couple of hundred people,\ntell me, what do women want in a mate?\nAnd so I start it with the blackboard.\nThis is back in the old days\nwhen there was a blackboard, a\npiece of chalk, and they say,\nI want a mate who has\na good sense of humor.\nSo I write sense of humor.\nIntelligent, kind.\nAnd so I go through this, and\nI go through five blackboards,\nand then I run out of\nspace, over what women want.\nNow I do the same for men,\nand men kind of run out of space\nafter about a blackboard and a half.\nBut what that tells me\nis that these qualities\nare large in number and\ncomplicated in nature.\nSo you say you want a guy\nwho's nice and generous?\nAnd they say, yeah.\nSo like a guy who at\nthe end of every month\ntakes his whole paycheck\nand gives it to the\nwino, a homeless person.\nWell no, not that generous,\ngenerous toward me,\nbut not toward everyone else.\nNice in general,\nbut not so nice that\nthey're getting exploited.\nSo, or even, now there's something,\nyou can't be too healthy.\nSo if you put it, that's uni-dimensional,\nbut you want a guy,\nwomen want a guy who's\nconfident, but not too confident,\nbecause too confident will\nmean he's either arrogant,\nnarcissistic, or not\nsufficiently manipulable.\nSo anyway, my point is that\nbecause there are so many\ndifferent components of mate value,\nand that they vary in amount.\nSo it's not just listing the\nqualities and summing them up.\nThey vary in amount.\nIt's a very complicated\nendeavor to assess accurately,\nbut I think people have\na good intuitive sense\nof people's relative mate value,\nespecially if you're in a group\nand you've been able to interact\nwith them for a long time.\nAnd one indication is, again,\nthat attention structure.\nHow many other people\nwill really want to mate with this person?\nThat's a good cue that\nthey're high in mate value.\nNobody wants to mate with you,\nthen cue that your low in mate value.\n- Reminds of the time when\none is trying to decide\nwho to ask to the prom.\nThere's a complicated assessment\nbased on who one would like to go with,\nwhether or not you're already partnered,\nwho would say yes, who would say no,\nbecause there's a risk in rejection too,\nbecause that if I'm guessing correctly,\ncould lower one's own\nperceived mate value.\n- Getting rejected.\n- Right.\nFrequency of rejections probably\ndoesn't lend itself well\nto increasing one's own\nview of their mate value.\n- Right, which is why many guys have\nwhat I call mating anxiety.\nThat is, they don't approach women\nbecause they risk getting shot down.\n- They're trying to maintain that number,\nby reducing the amount of data.\n- [David] Right.\n- Very interesting.\n- But it backfires in\nthe modern environment.\nSo, there's a famous\npsychologist, Albert Ellis,\nwho had mating anxiety and\nhe assigned himself the task\nof asking, like,\nI can't remember what the number was,\nbut let's say 50 women out on dates.\nHe lived in New York City,\nso there was a lot of women.\n- He could just stand still\nand they would stream past him.\n- And he asked 50 women on a\ndate, you know, every week.\nAnd he said, after two weeks\nhis mating anxiety disappeared,\nbecause most of them said, buzz off creep,\n[indistinct]\nActually getting rejected didn't\ncause my world to collapse.\nAnd it actually was okay.\nAnd so he kind of inured\nhimself to this rejection.\nAnd so it ended up,\nhe ended up doing quite\nwell on his mating life.\n- Another point for cognitive\nbehavioral desensitization.\n- [David] Exactly.\n- He ran the experiment.\nJust a couple more questions.\nEarlier, you mentioned\nself-deception-based deception,\nor something of that sort.\nSelf-deception that people aren't\nalways trying to convince\nsomebody else of something\nthat secretly they know isn't true,\nbut that they deceive themselves.\nCould you embellish on that a little bit?\n- Well, this is actually, this hypothesis\nis the famous evolutionary\nbiologist, Robert Trivers,\nfirst advanced this\nhypothesis in the preface,\nin 1976 to Dawkins'\nbook, The Selfish Gene.\nAnd he's subsequently\nwritten more about it,\nboth in scientific article\nand in a more popular book.\nBut the idea is, the core idea\nis that successful deception\nis facilitated by self-deception.\nSo if you really believe that in X,\nthen you're going to be a\nmore successful salesman\nto convince other people of X.\nSo if you believe you're,\nlet's say a 10 in mate value,\nyou truly believe it, even if you're not,\nI'm going to have a more successful time\nconvincing you that I am as well.\nAnd so the hypothesis is basically\nthat people self-deceive\nin order to increase\nthe effectiveness of actual deception.\nBut I think that there are people who\nare so in one other\ndimension I'll mention too,\nis that as that animals\noften take each other\nat our own word for things.\nSo if we're self-confident,\npeople assume that we must have the goods\nto back up that self-confidence.\nIf we're a quivering mass of insecurity,\npeople believe, well,\nwe don't have the goods\nto back up anything.\nAnd so people use other people's displays\nof their self-confidence\nas a cue to their goods.\nAnd it's in general,\na pretty reliable cue,\nbut then they are over\noverestimates and underestimates,\nas we've talked about,\nlike with narcissism.\n- Yeah, we see this\nwith the job candidates.\nYou are taught to look very\ncarefully at the application\nand consider all aspects,\nbut ultimately you consider\nthat also in light of, you know,\nhow firmly someone believes in the vision\nof what they're trying to\nbring to the profession.\nAnd that's a, I think, largely\na subconscious process,\nand being aware of it\ncan be helpful, but yeah,\nwhen somebody is confident\nand you tend to think that\nthey're going to get where\nthey say they're going to go\nand it acts as a bit of a heuristic,\nfor not needing, the impulses,\nthat one then doesn't need\nto go vet all the information\nquite as carefully.\nBut if, I guess if one\nis aware of it, then,\nyou know, to dig deeper,\nbecause it seems like there's\na lot of deception going on.\n- Yeah well,\nand something we talked about earlier,\npeople high on psychopathy\nare very good at deception.\nI don't know whether they\nare good at self-deception,\nor whether they're just\nreally good deceivers.\nBut they can be very effective.\nOut in California, you\nlive out in California,\nI'm sure you've seen your\nfair share of cases like that.\n- Oh yeah, I think,\nacross today's discussion and\nvarious examples pop to mind\nof seeing these features in humans.\nIt's so interesting.\nI find the work that you\ndo incredibly interesting.\nI think this field of\nevolutionary psychology\nis fascinating.\nAnd, I hope, I said it\nbefore, but I'll say it again.\nI feel like neuroscience\nand evolutionary psychology\nare nudging towards one another.\nAnd it's only a matter\nof time before they merge\nin some formal way.\nI mean, there is the work for instance,\non polygamous versus\nmonogamous [indistinct],\nand levels of vasopressin,\nbut it's a big leap to go from vasopressin\nin a [indistinct],\nno disrespect to that beautiful work,\nbut to humans and say, oh,\nvasopressin inhaler are going to make you\nmonogamous or something.\nI think that's probably got the direction\nof the effect wrong,\nbut you get the point.\n- Yeah, no, I think\nyou're absolutely right.\nAnd I think it will happen.\nI think it's starting to happen.\nAnd it will happen because\ngetting at the neuroscience\nis getting at the underlying mechanisms\nthat are driving the process.\nSo, you know,\nwhat an evolutionary\nperspective brings to bear,\nis evolved function and\nultimate explanation,\nthe selective forces\nthat created adaptations,\nthe functions of those adaptations,\nand the neuroscience brings well,\nwhat is the underlying machinery\nthat these mechanisms are instantiated in?\n- It'd be wonderful to\ncollaborate someday.\nMaybe we'll do a brain imaging study\non jealousy or something,\nand I don't know, you're the psychologist.\nYou would come up with the\nbeautiful experimental design.\nI'm certain that people are going to want\nto learn more about your work.\nCertainly we will give them links\nto your social media\nand other other sites.\nYou've written a tremendous number\nof really interesting books.\nTell us about your most recent book,\nand maybe some of the others,\nthat if people are\ninterested in these topics,\nand they want to learn more,\nthat they could explore.\n- Sure.\nOkay so, well,\nmy most recent book is\ncalled, When Men Behave Badly:\nThe Hidden Roots of Sexual Deception,\nHarassment, and Assault,\nand that book deals with\nconflict between the sexes,\nsexual conflict.\nAnd so it deals with them both\nin what I call mating market conflicts.\nSome of the topics we've\nbeen talking about,\ndeception in internet\ndating, and things like that.\nSecond is conflict that occurs\nwithin mating relationships,\nof the sort that we've\nbeen talking about as well,\nfinancial infidelity,\nemotional infidelity,\nsexual infidelity,\ncoping with conflict\nwithin a relationship.\nAnd I actually have some suggestions\nfor strategies for coping with conflict\nwithin a relationship.\nCoping in dealing with\nthe aftermath of breakups.\nSo often there's an asymmetry.\nOne person wants to break\nup, the other doesn't.\nSo I talk about coping in the aftermath.\nAnd then I also talk in this\nbook, When Men Behave Badly,\nabout some of the darker\nsides of human mating,\nlike intimate partner violence,\nstalking, sexual\nharassment, sexual coercion.\nSo that's what that book's about.\nAnd I think it,\nit's gotten well-reviewed\nand people find it\nvery useful in understanding\nwhat is otherwise a lot\nof baffling phenomena.\nWhy do men and women seem\nat odds with each other\nin so many domains?\nWhy does some of these recurrent forms\nof sexual conflict occur?\nSo that's what that book's about.\nMy previous book, so my first book,\nwhich I've had the good fortune\nto be able to revise a couple of times,\ndeals more broadly with\nhuman mating strategies.\nIt's called, The Evolution of Desire:\nStrategies of Human Mating.\nAnd it gives people a broad overview\nof what people want in a mate,\ntactics of attraction,\ntactics of mate retention,\nand so forth, throughout\nthe whole mating process,\nserial mating, causes of\ndivorce, and so forth.\nAnd then even more broadly,\nI have a textbook called,\nEvolutionary Psychology:\nThe New Science of the Mind,\nwhich is in its sixth edition right now,\nand it's the most widely used textbook\nin evolutionary psychology\naround North America and Europe.\nAnd actually it's been translated\neven into Arabic and other countries.\nSo that deals somewhat with mating,\nbut also deals with survival problems,\nour evolved fears and phobias,\nissues about kin and family,\nextended family, friendships,\nsocial hierarchy,\nstatus hierarchies,\nwarfare, and other topics.\nSo the evolutionary psychology textbook\nis the broadest book.\nAnd then maybe the second broadest is\nThe Evolution of Desire:\nStrategies of Human Mating.\nAnd then for those interested\nin conflict between the sexes,\nthe latest book, When Men Behave Badly.\n- Fantastic.\nI love your work.\nI'm so grateful for the\nclarity and depth and rigor\nwith which you do it,\nand you convey it to us.\nI know I speak for many people\nwhen I just want to say thank you.\nThis is a tremendously\ninformative conversation.\n- Thank you.\nWell, it's been a delight to talk with you\nand I hope we do engage in\nthat research collaboration\nof merging neuroscience and\nevolutionary psychology.\n- Let's do it.\n- All right.\n- Great,\nthank you David.\n- Thank you.\n- Thank you for joining me\nfor my
