    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are talking all\nabout the science of gratitude.\nIn part, we're doing this\nbecause of the upcoming\nThanksgiving holiday,\nwhich of course, is all about\ngiving thanks, gratitude,\nbut also because there's\nno a wealth of data\nshowing that having an\neffective gratitude practice\ncan impact a huge number\nof health variables;\nboth mental health and physical\nhealth in positive ways.\nThings like cardiovascular health,\nthings like relationships,\nthings like mental health,\nthings like physical and\ncognitive performance.\nAnd these are not small effects.\nThese are very large positive effects.\nHowever, in researching this episode,\nI was completely surprised\nas to what constitutes an\neffective gratitude practice.\nI, I think like many of\nyou, would have thought\nthat an effective gratitude practice\nsimply involves writing down a few things\nor many things that we're grateful for,\nor thinking about those.\nOr really making an effort to somaticize\nor feel some of the elements of gratitude\nwhile writing out that list\nor thinking about that list.\nIt turns out that an\neffective gratitude practice\ndoesn't resemble that at all.\nThe neuroimaging data,\nthe physiological data,\nlooking at things like inflammatory\nmarkers, other studies,\npurely looking at the\npsychology and the long\nand short-term effects of an\neffective gratitude practice,\npoint to a completely different\napproach to using gratitude\nto positively impact health metrics.\nFortunately, these are things\nthat we can all do very easily.\nSome of them were actually fun.\nYou can do them in a variety of contexts.\nSo today we're going to\ntalk about the science\nof effective gratitude practices,\nand we're going to describe what those are\nand how you can incorporate\nthem into your life.\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\nI just want to highlight\na particularly interesting set of findings\nfrom the literature.\nThis is a study that came out\nin the journal Cell Report,\nCell Press journal, excellent journal.\nIt's very relevant to today's topic.\nIn fact, we're going to spend\nmore time with this paper\na little bit later in the episode.\nThe study involved having\nsubjects listen to a story.\nThe subjects are all\nlistening to the same story,\nbut those subjects are not\nlistening to it together.\nThey're not rounded up in\na circle or all in a room,\nthey're in separate rooms\nor entirely separate\nlocations on the planet,\nor they are actually\nbrought into the laboratory\non separate days.\nWhat this study found is\nthat different subjects\nlistening to the same story,\nundergo the same variation in heart rate.\nIn other words, the gaps\nbetween their heartbeats\nstart to resemble one another\nin response to the same story.\nNow, this is very interesting.\nThis is a coordination of\nthe physiology of the body\nin response to a narrative,\na story in different people.\nAnd yet when they line up the heart rates\nof these different people\nwho listen to the story\nat completely different times,\nthey find that those heart rates\nmap onto one another almost identically.\nIt's really remarkable.\nWe're going to talk about what this means\nin terms of coordination of\nneural circuits in the brain\nand neural circuits in the body,\nand the organs such as the heart,\nbut also the lungs and\nother organs of the body,\nand what this means for\nchanging one's overall state.\nA key theme that's going to\ncome up today again and again\nis the distinction between traits,\nwhich are kind of pervasive\naspects of who we are\nand how we tend to react\nto different types of circumstances,\nand states, which are more transient.\nThey tend to, you know, you\ncan invoke a state in somebody,\na state of fear or a state of relaxation.\nBut what this study\nreally starts to point to\nis that there are specific approaches\nthat any of us can take\nin order to really rewire\nour nervous system,\nsuch that we are calmer,\nif we want to be calmer\nin certain circumstances,\nthat we are more responsive\nin certain circumstances,\nif that's our goal.\nSo we'll return to how one\nwould go about doing that.\nBut I think these results\nare just beautiful\nin the sense that they really show\nthat our brain and our\nbody are highly coordinated\nbecause people are listening to the story\nand the heart rate is changing\nin response to the story,\nbut that there is what\nwe call a stereotypy;\nsort of stereotyped\nresponse to a given story.\nIn my mind, there was no reason\nwhy the results had to be this way.\nTwo people listen to the same story,\nwhy should their heart\nrates be almost identical\nto the same story?\nVery, very interesting and\npoints to the power of narrative\nand story in coordinating our physiology.\nAnd this is something\npowerful that we can leverage.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nAnd keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that the visual system\nhas a number of important features\nthat allow you to see\nthings with crystal clarity,\nno matter what environment you're in.\nSo that means if you're in bright sunlight\nor you go into shadows,\nyou should be able to\nsee everything clearly.\nBut many eyeglasses and sunglasses\nactually short circuit that\nfeature of our visual system,\nand make it such that we\nhave to take off our glasses,\nor if our screen dims,\nwe feel like we can't\nsee things quite right.\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nhave completely solved that problem.\nIn addition, they're very lightweight,\nso you don't even remember\nthat they're on your face.\nAnd if you get sweaty,\nthey don't slip off.\nThey were actually designed\nfor cycling and running\nand things of that sort, but\nthey have a terrific aesthetic.\nSo I wear readers at\nnight or out to dinner,\nor when I'm driving, I\nwear their sunglasses.\nAnd the aesthetics are really terrific,\neven though they're so-called\nperformance glasses.\n'Cause as many of you know,\nperformance glasses often\nmake people look like cyborgs.\nThese sunglasses and eyeglasses\nhave the kind of aesthetic\nthat you can wear them anywhere;\nwhile cycling, running,\nbut also doing anything\nelse you might be doing.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nglasses, you can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code

a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better meet your immediate\nand long-term health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done.\nFor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now, with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also get insights into your genes\nand how those affect or\nshould affect your immediate\nand long-term health choices.\nA big problem with a lot of blood tests\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis that you get the data back\nand you don't know what\nto do with the data.\nInside Tracker has solve that problem\nwith a very easy to use dashboard,\nwhere you get your numbers\nback from your blood tests\nor your DNA tests,\nand then it points to\nspecific lifestyle factors,\nnutritional factors, and so forth,\nthat can allow you to bring\nthe numbers into the ranges\nthat are optimal for you.\nAnd this is a huge advantage\nover other blood tests\nand DNA tests out there.\nAnother feature that Inside Tracker has\nis their InnerAge test.\nThe InnerAge test shows you\nwhat your biological age is,\nand you can compare that\nto your chronological age.\nAnd of course, your\nbiological age is equally,\nif not more important than\nyour chronological age.\nSo this is an important number\nthat you can get from Inside Tracker.\nIf you'd like to try Inside Tracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman,\nto get 25% off any of\nInside Tracker's plans.\nAnd

a zero sugar, grain-free,\nketo-friendly cereal.\nNow, I'm not following a\nketogenic nutrition plan.\nWhat works best for me is to\nfast until about 11:00 a.m.\nor noon most days, and then to\neat a low carbohydrate lunch,\na low carbohydrate snack in the afternoon,\nand in the evening is\nwhen I eat my starches.\nThat's what allows me to\nbe alert throughout the day\nfor work, for exercise and so forth,\nand then to sleep really well at night.\nThat's just what works for me.\nBut it does require\nthat throughout the day,\nI am eating fewer carbohydrates\nthan I am at night.\nAnd oftentimes I want a snack,\nand the snack I want\nis usually Magic Spoon.\nMagic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,\n13 to 14 grams of protein,\nand only four net grams of\ncarbohydrates in each serving.\nIt's absolutely delicious.\nI particularly like the frosted flavor\n'cause it tastes like donuts.\nAnd then I try not to eat donuts.\nNo vendetta against donuts,\nbut it's not really compatible\nwith my eating plan.\nThey also have flavors like\ncocoa, fruity, peanut butter.\nThey're really delicious.\nAny ideas you have about\nketo-friendly cereals\nand foods not being delicious,\nyou have to try Magic Spoon,\nit'll change your mind.\nIn fact I'm getting hungry just\nthinking about it right now.\nIf you want to try Magic Spoon,\nyou can go to magicspoon.com/huberman\nto get a variety

begin, I'd like to\nemphasize the various aspects\nof mental and physical health\nthat have been shown to benefit\nfrom a regular gratitude practice.\nThere are studies showing\nthat performing a gratitude\npractice twice or three times,\nor even just once a week,\ncan lead to a pervasive,\na long lasting impact\non subjective wellbeing.\nPeople report feeling\nhappier, more meaning, joy,\neven awe for their life experience,\nsimply in response to\nadding a gratitude practice.\nThe key thing is it has to be\nthe right gratitude practice.\nAnd we're going to talk about\nwhat the right gratitude\npractice looks like\nin just a little bit.\nBut there are additional\nbenefits of a gratitude practice.\nThere are studies showing that\na regular gratitude practice\ncan provide resilience\nto trauma, in two ways;\nit can provide a reframing\nand resilience to prior\ntraumatic experiences.\nSo buffering people\nagainst the negative physiological effects\nand psychological effects\nof earlier trauma,\nbut also inoculating them in many ways\nto any traumas that might\narrive later in life.\nSo that's a powerful thing.\nAnd today we will talk about\nhow that's actually accomplished.\nIt's actually accomplished\nby shifting the way\nthat the fear and defense networks\nin the brain actually function.\nAnd we'll get right down\ninto the details of that.\nThe other thing that a\ngratitude practice does\nis it's been shown to\nbenefit social relationships.\nBut not just for the relationship\nin which you express gratitude, right?\nSo on the face of it, you might think,\nokay, if I express gratitude\nfor somebody over and over,\nover and over, over and over,\nthen I'm going to feel\nbetter about that person.\nAnd indeed, that is one effect\nof a gratitude practice.\nThat's called a pro-social\nor interstitial social gratitude practice.\nBut there are now several studies,\nrecent studies in good\njournals pointing to the fact\nthat a regular gratitude\npractice can also enhance\none's social relationships\nacross the board;\nin the workplace, at\nschool, at with family\nand romantic relationships,\nand even one's relationship to themselves,\nwhich is really what\nthe subjective feelings\nof wellbeing are.\nSo it's clear to me that\nineffective gratitude practice\nhas an outsized effect\non many, many aspects\nof mental and physical health.\nAnd for those of you\nthat are coming to this\nconversation thinking,\ngratitude practice, oh, that's\nkind of wishy-washy or woo,\nit's going to involve putting\nyour hand on your heart\nand feeling into all the amazing things\nthat you happen to have,\neven when things are really terrible,\nthat's not where we're going at all.\nAnd equally important is to understand\nthat the neurochemical,\nthe anti-inflammatory\nand the neural circuit mechanisms\nthat gratitude can invoke\nare equally on par with some\nof the effects of pharmacology,\nof things like high\nintensity interval training\nand exercise, and other\nthings that we think of\nas kind of more potent\nforms of self intervention.\nSo if you are of the mindset\nthat a gratitude practice\nis kind of weak sauce, buckle up,\nbecause the data actually\npoints to the fact\nthat a gratitude practice\nis a very, very potent way\nin which you can steer your\nmental and physical health\nin positive directions,\nand that those effects\nare very long lasting.\nBefore we dive into the\ntools and mechanisms\nand scientific studies around gratitude,\nI'd like to just set the\nframework for the discussion.\nGratitude is what we call\na pro-social behavior\nor a pro-social mindset.\nNow, you can be grateful for something\nwithout it involving anybody else.\nSo the social part isn't\nmeant to convey anything\nabout interpersonal\nrelations, although it can.\nAnd today we're going to talk a lot about\nhow interpersonal relations\ncan be incorporated\ninto a gratitude practice\nin really powerful ways.\nBut pro-social behaviors\nare basically any behavior\nor mode of thinking that\nallow us to be more effective\nin interactions with other\npeople, including ourselves.\nNow pro-social is not\njust a name that we give\nthese different tools and\npractices and mindsets.\nThey're actually neural\ncircuits in the brain\nthat are specifically wired\nfor pro-social thoughts and behaviors.\nAnd these are distinctly different\nfrom the circuits in the brain\nthat are involved in defensive behaviors.\nSo without getting into too much detail,\njust yet, we will later,\nwe have circuits in the brain\nthat are what we call appetitive.\nThey are designed to\nbring us closer to things\nand to bring us into closer relation\nto the details of that sensory experience.\nNow that could be a delicious\nfood that you're eating,\nit could be interacting with a loved one,\nit could be interacting with a friend\nor anyone that you happen to like,\nit could even be in your\nrelation to yourself.\nThese circuits that we're\ncalling pro-social circuits\nlight up in the brain in neuroimaging,\nmeaning the neurons are\nfiring more actively,\nmore electrically robustly;\nsort of like turning up the volume\non these neural circuits in the brain.\nAnd the neural circuits in the brain\nthat are associated with\naversive or defensive behaviors;\nthings like backing up things,\nlike covering up the\nvital organs of the body,\nthings like a quaking of the voice,\nall of the things are associated\nwith defensive behaviors\nare actually antagonized,\nmeaning they are reduced\nwhen the pro-social\ncircuits are more active.\nSo the framework here that I'd like to set\nis that we have this kind of seesaw\nof neural circuits in the brain.\nOne set that are\npro-social and are designed\nto bring us closer to\nothers, including ourselves,\ncloser to certain sensory\nexperiences, right?\nBecause a lot of pro-social behaviors\ncan also be geared towards\nthings like pets or food,\nor anything that we find\nwe want to be closer to\nand want more of.\nWhereas the defensive circuits\ninvolve areas of the brain,\nyes, such as areas that\nare involved in fear,\nbut also areas of the brain and body\nthat are literally\nassociated with freezing\nor with backing up.\nSo the way to think about gratitude\nis that falls under this\ncategory of pro-social behaviors,\nwhich are designed\nto bring us closer to\ndifferent types of things,\nand to enhance the level of detail\nthat we extract from those experiences.\nNow, the existence of\nthese two neuro circuits\nthat I've placed on this sort\nof a metaphorical seesaw,\nif you will,\nruns counter to a lot of\nthe messaging or the ideas\nthat were put forth in the last century\nabout the psychology of\nhappiness and gratitude,\nversus the psychology of\ndepression and struggle\nand concern about the future.\nIn fact, I'd like to read\na quote from the great,\nand we really should call\nhim the great Sigmund Freud,\nbecause despite having certain traits\nthat people criticize him of,\nFreud was indeed a genius\nabout many aspects of psychology.\nBut I just want to read you\nFreud's stance on happiness.\nAnd this invokes elements\nof gratitude as well.\nAnd then you can gauge for yourself.\n\"Our possibilities of happiness\nare already restricted\nby our constitution.\"\nSo he's saying that we're basically wired\nto not have happiness easily.\n\"Unhappiness is much less\ndifficult to experience.\nWe are threatened with\nsuffering from three directions;\none from our own body,\nwhich is doomed to decay and disillusion,\nand which cannot even do without pain\nand anxiety as warning signals.\nTwo, from the external world,\nwhich may rage against\nus with overwhelming\nand merciless forces of destruction.\nAnd three and finally, from\nour relations with others,\nthe suffering of which\nfrom this last source\nis perhaps more painful\nto us than any other.\"\nThat's Sigmund Freud.\nAnd not all of his writings\nwere pessimistic, if you will.\nWhat Freud is referring to there\nare those defensive circuits.\nAnd of course, he talks about\npsychological defensives.\nAnd in full disclosure, I am a huge fan\nof much of the psychological literature\nand psychoanalysis of Sigmund\nFreud and his descendants,\nlike Young and others.\nI think there are strong\nelements of truth there.\nBut he gives you a sense\nof the kind of mindset\nof psychology early in the last century.\nAnd then of course, was the emergence\nof the positive psychology movement,\nwhich was really about\ninvoking the understanding\nand eventually the elucidation\nof the neural circuits\nfor things like happiness\nand awe and affiliation\nand things that we are\ncalling pro-social circuits.\nSo the field of psychology as\na dark and light, if you will,\nand the field of neuroscience\nhas a dark and light.\nWe have these what we call\nparallel pathways in the brain.\nAnd we have parallel pathways in the mind\nthat set us up for\nfeeling good about things\nor for feeling less good about things.\nI think what's really salient\nfrom the quote from Freud\nis that what he's saying is our default\nis to be concerned about the future,\nto be wrapped in our defenses,\nand to some extent that's true.\nAnd the reason we can say that's true\nis because most of us\nneed a gratitude practice.\nWe need to do certain things\nin order to feel good and to feel happy.\nWe actually have to put work into it.\nIt is quite possible\nthat there's an asymmetry\nin the way that these pro-social\nversus defensive circuits are set up,\nsuch that because defensive circuits\nare designed to keep us safe,\npsychologically and physically safe,\nthat they have more robustness,\nor they can actually drive\nour behavior more easily.\nI'll give you an analogy in the system\nthat I'm most familiar\nwith as a neuroscientist,\nwhich is the visual system.\nIn the visual system, we\nhave parallel pathways.\nWe have neurons in our eye that respond\nwhen things in our\nenvironment get brighter.\nLiterally when the lights go up,\nthese neurons start firing like crazy.\nAnd we have neurons in our eye\nthat respond when things get darker,\nwhen things start dimming\nor go from white to black.\nThe circuits for detecting\ndarkening are much more robust\nand much more numerous than are\nthe circuits for brightness.\nAnd that is probably related, probably,\nto the fact that dark objects\nor experiencing looming,\nmeaning incoming objects and\nbeing able to perceive them\nis something that's vital to our survival.\nWhereas being able to perceive\nthe brightening of things\nmight be important to\nsurvival in certain contexts;\na car lights coming at you at night\nor something of that sort,\nbut not as often in a\nkind of a evolutionary\nor ecological context as\nthe darkening of things.\nSo, I think Freud's quote\nand the field of psychology\nnow point to the fact that indeed we have\nthe capacity for happiness\nand we have the capacity\nfor great worry and concern\nand depression and unhappiness.\nAnd the neural circuit\nliterature also supports that.\nThe key thing for today's discussion\nis that gratitude turns out to be\none of the most potent wedges\nby which we can insert our thinking,\nand as you also see, the\nphysiology of our body,\nbetween these two circuits,\nand give a little more\nlevity, if you will,\nto the side of the seesaw\nthat's associated with\npositive pro-social feelings.\nAnd if you keep imagining\nthis seesaw imagery,\nwhat's really beautiful\nabout gratitude practices\nis that if they're performed repeatedly,\nand not even that often, but repeatedly,\nthen one can actually\nshift their neural circuits\nsuch that the seesaw that\nI'm calling pro-social\nversus defensive behaviors,\ncan actually start to tilt.\nAnd the little hinge, if you will,\non the seesaw in the\nmiddle can be adjusted\nin a little tighter when\nthe side for gratitude\nand for wellbeing and\nfor feelings of happiness\nis a little bit higher.\nWhat this means is that,\nwhether or not Freud was right or wrong,\nwhether or not the neuroscientists\nin one camp or another\nwere right or wrong,\nwe now know with certainty that\na regular gratitude practice\ncan shift the pro-social circuit\nso that they dominate our\nphysiology and our mindset\nin ways that can enhance\nmany, many aspects\nof our physical and\nmental health by default.\nSo we don't always have to\nconstantly be in practice\ntrying to be happy.\nSo the succinct way of saying all this is,\nyes, indeed, we might be wired\nor in such that we have\na greater propensity\nfor unhappiness than happiness.\nBut gratitude practices provided\nthey are the effective ones\nand they're performed regularly,\ncan shift those circuits,\nsuch that we are happier on average,\neven when we are not\nperforming those practices.\nNow I'd like to talk about\nsome of the neurochemistry\nand neural circuits\nassociated with gratitude\nand pro-social behaviors.\nNumerous times on this podcast,\nI've talked about\nso-called neuromodulators.\nFor those of you that might've forgotten\nor have never heard of\nneuromodulators before,\nneuromodulators are chemicals\nthat are released in the brain and body\nthat change the activity\nof other neural circuits.\nThey make certain brain areas\nmore likely to be active\nand other brain areas\nless likely to be active.\nThese neuromodulators have\nnames like dopamine, serotonin,\nacetylcholine, epinephrin, and so on.\nThe main neuromodulators\nassociated with gratitude\nand pro-social behaviors\ntends to be serotonin.\nSerotonin is released\nfrom a very small collection\nof neurons in the brainstem\ncalled the raphe, R-A-P-H-E,\nthe raphe nucleus,\nand a few other places in the brain.\nAnd the raphe neuron\nsend these little wires\nthat we call axons out to\nnumerous places in the brain.\nAnd they tend to increase the activity\nof particular neurocircuits\nthat lend themselves\nto more approach to particular\ntypes of experiences.\nThat makes total sense\nif you think about it.\nHave a chemical that under\ncertain circumstances\nis released in the brain,\nthat triggers the activity\nof neural circuits,\nthat makes the organism, you,\nmore likely to stay in an\ninteraction with something,\nor even lean in and seek a\nmore detailed interaction\nwith that person, place or thing.\nBeautiful work from a\ncognitive neuropsychologist.\nHis name is Antonio Demasio.\nHe's a world-class neuroscientists.\nHas been in the game a very long time.\nHas explored the so-called\nneural correlates of gratitude.\nAnd two main brain areas are activated\nby these serotonergic systems.\nAnd when people experience something\nthat makes them feel gratitude,\neven if it's shallow gratitude or deep,\nand if it's all the way to deep gratitude,\nthey see activation of these\nparticular brain circuits\nI'll mention in a moment.\nAnd the amount of activation scales\nwith how intensely the person experience\nthe feeling of gratitude.\nAnd those two areas have particular names.\nYou don't need to know the names,\nbut for those of you that want to know,\nthey are the anterior cingulate cortex\nand the medial prefrontal cortex.\nAnd of course, these\nbrain areas are connected\nto a number of other\nnetworks in the brain.\nIn fact, that's how they get you or others\nto lean into certain experiences.\nBecause when these areas are active,\ncertain thought processes get invoked.\nThose thought processes probably\nresemble something like,\nhmm, I'd like to experience more of this,\nor hmm, this feels really good.\nAnd then they literally\nfeed onto your muscles\nvia the neurons, making you\nhappy to stay stationary,\nif you're experiencing something you like,\nor to move closer to something\nthat you find attractive to you literally.\nSo these are powerful circuits.\nOf these two brain areas,\nthe one I'd like to focus on the most\nis the medial prefrontal cortex.\nMany of you have probably heard\nof the medial prefrontal cortex,\nbecause this is the area of the brain\nthat is involved in planning\nand in deep thinking\nand evaluation of different\ntypes of experiences,\npast, present, or future.\nIt seems actually that\npretty much every study\nof human anything seems to involve\nthe medial prefrontal cortex,\nor at least one could get that impression\njust by looking at scientific abstracts\nand papers these days.\nSo I think it's worth us\ntaking a step back and asking,\nwhat is the medial prefrontal\ncortex really do, right?\nHow could this one piece\nof neural real estate\nthat we all have right\nbehind our forehead,\nhow could that be involved\nin so many different things?\nAnd the reason it can be involved\nin so many different things,\nand the reason it's especially\nimportant for gratitude\nis that medial prefrontal\ncortex sets context, okay?\nIt sets context and it literally defines\nthe meaning of your experience.\nNow this is not at all\nan abstract phenomenon.\nI'm going to give a very\nphysiological example of this,\nand then we're going to\ntranslate to gratitude.\nBut I really want everyone to understand,\nhow is it that medial prefrontal cortex\nsets the context of\neverything in your life?\nWell, it does it the following way.\nYou have a number of\ncircuits deeper in your brain\nthat simply create some\nsensations or they allow you,\nI should say, to perceive\ncertain sensations.\nLet's use the example of cold exposure,\nsomething that we'd sometimes\ntalk about in this podcast,\nfor other reasons.\nIf you were to deliberately\nplace yourself into an ice bath,\nit would be uncomfortable,\neven if you're adapted\nto cold and so forth.\nThe discomfort is non-negotiable.\nHowever, if you are doing\nit because you want to,\nor because you have knowledge\nthat there are particular health benefits,\nthe medial prefrontal cortex\ncan then control areas\nof your deeper brain,\nlike the hypothalamus,\nto positively impact\nthe neurochemicals that are\nreleased into your system.\nYou'll still get a lot of adrenaline\nby getting into the ice bath.\nBut the fact that you are\ndoing this deliberately,\nand your knowledge that\nyou are making the choice,\nthat it's you that's\ndeciding to put yourself\nthrough this discomfort,\nhas been shown to create a very different\nand positive effect on\nthings like dopamine,\non things like anti-inflammatory markers,\nin your immune system, et cetera,\ncompared to if someone\npushes you into an ice bath,\nor if you are doing it\nbecause someone insists\nthat you do it and you\nreally, really don't want to.\nSo there's a very subtle distinction here.\nIt's just the distinction\nof motivation and desire,\nor lack of motivation and\nbeing forced into something.\nAnd there are a number\nof other effects of this\nthat have been described.\nIn the episode with Robert Sapolsky\nthat I did earlier this last year,\nhe talked about a study in animals,\nwhich has also been shown in humans.\nIf you take a mouse for instance,\nand it runs on a running wheel,\nwhich mice really like to do,\nthere are many positive effects\non reducing blood pressure,\nimprovements in neurochemistry,\net cetera, in that mouse.\nHowever, if there's a mouse\nin the cage right next to it\nthat's trapped in the running wheel\nand it has to run every\ntime the other mouse runs\n'cause the wheels are linked,\nwell, then the second\nmouse that's forced to do\nthe exact same running\nexperiences negative shifts\nin their overall health metrics.\nBlood pressure goes up, stress\nhormones go up, et cetera,\nbecause it's not actually\nmaking the choice.\nMedial prefrontal cortex is the knob,\nor the switch rather, that\ncan take one experience\nand allow us to frame it\nsuch that it creates\npositive health effects.\nAnd the exact same experience\nframed as something we don't want to do,\nor that we are forced to do\ncan create negative health effects.\nNow how exactly the neurons\nand medial prefrontal cortex\ndo that is rather complicated,\nand frankly not completely understood.\nBut it's somehow able to adjust\nthe activity of other neural circuits\nthat are purely reflexive.\nAs we say, neuroscience, like\nreally dumb neural circuits,\nthey're just like switches,\nand place a context onto it.\nSo, gratitude is a mindset\nthat activates prefrontal cortex,\nand in doing so sets the\ncontext of your experience\nsuch that you can derive\ntremendous health benefits.\nWhich leads us to the question;\nwhat kind of gratitude practice\nis going to accomplish this, right?\nBecause it is not simply the\ncase that I could take a knife,\ndon't please, don't do this experiment,\nand cut my hand and say, oh, you\nknow, I'm going to enjoy this.\nI'm doing this 'cause this is\ngood for me and it won't hurt.\nOf course it'll hurt,\njust like the ice bath\nis cold, no matter what.\nBut I can't lie to myself, right?\nIf I have some knowledge that\ncutting myself is bad for me,\nthat's very hard to override.\nAnd so, the medial prefrontal cortex\nhas a tremendous capacity to set context.\nAnd it does that beautifully\nwith respect to gratitude.\nBut you can't simply lie to yourself.\nYou can't simply say, oh,\nwell, every experience\nis a learning experience,\nor a terrible thing happens, oh, good,\nI'm just going to say good,\nand that your body will react\nas if it's good for you.\nThat's a myth.\nAnd frankly, it's a myth\nthat's fairly pervasive\nin the self-help and\nself-actualization literature.\nWe have the opportunity\nto reframe and set context\non our experiences.\nBut that requires a very\nspecific set of practices.\nWe can't simply lie to\nourselves or quote unquote,\nfake it until we make it.\nNeural circuitry is very\npowerful and very plastic.\nIt can be modified and it's\nvery context-dependent,\nbut it's not stupid.\nAnd when you lie to yourself about whether\nor not an experience is\nactually good for you or not,\nyour brain knows.\nSo what does an effective\ngratitude practice look like?\nWell, let's examine what an ineffective,\nwhat a poor gratitude practice looks like.\nBecause therein lies some\nreally important information,\nincluding the fact that I,\nand I think millions of\nother people out there\nare doing it wrong.\nMost gratitude practices\nthat you see online\nand that people talk about\nin various talks and so forth\ninvolves something like\nwriting down or reciting,\nor thinking about five or\n10 or three or 20 things\nthat you're especially grateful for.\nAnd then really trying to\nfeel into some of those,\nreally try and think\ndeeply about the emotions,\nthe sensations, the\nperceptions that are associated\nwith those particular people,\nplaces and things on your list.\nMost studies actually\npoint to the fact that\nthat style of gratitude practice\nis not particularly effective in shifting\nyour neural circuitry,\nyour neural chemistry,\nor your somatic circuitry,\nthe circuits in your body,\n'cause you literally have\norgans and neural circuits\nthat are connected,\nthe circuits of your brain and body\ntoward enhanced activation\nof prefrontal cortex,\nenhanced activation of these\npro-social neural networks\nthat we were talking about earlier.\nNow that may come as a\nsurprise to many of you,\nand certainly came as a surprise to me.\nThere is some evidence\nthat if there's a shift\nin so-called autonomic arousal\nduring these gratitude practices,\nthese ones that I'm calling ineffective,\nthat they can be made\nslightly more effective.\nSo what do I mean by a\nshift in autonomic arousal?\nWell, very briefly we have a\naspect to our nervous system,\nboth within our brain and body\nthat we call the autonomic nervous system.\nIt's a little bit of a misnomer\nbecause autonomic means automatic.\nAnd in fact, we can take control\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nIt has one branch, meaning\none set of connections\nand circuits that are associated\nwith making us more alert,\nthe so-called sympathetic nervous system,\nor I should say sympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nbut that's really a mouthful.\nIt's really associated with\nenhanced alertness of any kind\nfor excitement or fear,\nand it has nothing to do with sympathy.\nIt's just about enhanced alertness.\nAnd then the other arm of\nthe autonomic nervous system\nis the so-called parasympathetic arm\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nBut that's also a mouthful.\nSo let's just say it's the calming aspect\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nSo it's associated with\ndecreased heart rate,\ndecreased breathing rate, et cetera.\nSo we have these two aspects,\nour autonomic nervous system,\nand it has been shown\nthat if people are brought\ninto a state of heightened\nsympathetic tone,\nmeaning more alertness,\nthen the intensity of the\nemotions that they experience\nin their gratitude practice is enhanced,\nand the effectiveness of\nthat gratitude practice\ncan be enhanced.\nThis is seen nowadays somewhat\ncommonly as having people,\nfor instance, cyclic\nhyperventilated breathing,\nas we call it in my laboratory.\nBreathing that's very intense so that,\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale very deeply\nfor 25 or 30 breaths.\nThen people will sit\nin a meditative stance,\nor they'll focus on\ntheir notepad and paper.\nAnd they'll write out the things\nthat they're grateful for.\nAnd then they'll really try\nand feel into those things,\nor they'll think about those things.\nAnd it makes perfect sense\nas to why enhancing autonomic arousal\ntoward more alertness would\ncreate more robust feelings\nor more robust impact of\nthe gratitude practices,\nbecause in that state, you are more alert\nand therefore you are\nable to bring more detail,\nmore richness to the perception\nand the understanding\nof what those things on\nyour list happened to be.\nAnd I should say\nthat there are numerous\nother approaches to this.\nSort of self-help type stuff\nand self actualization seminars.\nPeople will do things like cold baths,\nor they'll do chanting,\nor they'll have any number\nof different experiences\nall of which are mainly geared\ntowards increased autonomic arousal.\nThere even practices out there\nusing pharmacology to create\nincreased autonomic arousal\nand then drop into gratitude.\nAcross the board, those\nincrease the potency\nof the gratitude practice of\nlisting things out on paper\nor in one's mind or saying them out loud.\nBut somewhat surprisingly, at least to me,\nthat form of just expressing\nthanks, expressing gratitude\nis not the most effective way\nto shift these pro-social circuits\nin positive ways for one's physiology\nand anatomy and psychology.\nIt turns out that the most\npotent form of gratitude practice\nis not a gratitude practice\nwhere you give gratitude\nor express gratitude,\nbut rather where you receive gratitude,\nwhere you receive thanks.\nAnd this to me was very surprising.\nThere are a number of\nstudies about this now.\nOne in particular that I\nthink is interesting is called\nPrefrontal activation while listening\nto a letter of gratitude read aloud\nby a coworker face-to-face: A NIRS study.\nN-I-R-S.\nI'll explain what all this means.\nYou now know what the\nprefrontal activation part is.\nThis is activation in\nthe prefrontal cortex.\nThe NIRS, N-I-R-S study,\nthat's just a technical term.\nIt's a form of imaging brain activity.\nIt's noninvasive.\nSo it's kind of a skullcap.\nIt looks like a hoodie\nwith a bunch of wires\ncoming out of it basically,\nthat can measure neural activity\nwithout having to remove\nany parts of the skull\nor put a person into one of\nthese two black fMRI machines,\nwhich is very invasive.\nIt's also a wonderful tool\nbecause it allows human subjects\nin the laboratory to move around\nand to engage with one another.\nSo in this particular\nexperiment, what they did\nis they had co-workers\nwrite a letter of gratitude,\nof thanks to another coworker,\nunbeknownst to the other coworker.\nAnd then they sat down together\nand then they imaged brain activity\nas this letter was being read\nand as the letter was\nbeing heard, received.\nAnd it showed very robust effects\non these prefrontal networks;\nthat pointed to the fact\nthat receiving gratitude\nis actually much more potent,\nin terms of the positive\nshifts that that can create\nthan giving gratitude.\nSo this raises a couple\nof important points.\nFirst of all, if you are\nsomebody who is prone\nto write letters of gratitude,\nideally I think it's requisite\nthat these be genuine\nletters of gratitude,\nor saying things that are\ngenuine expressions of gratitude.\nThis could be by text or\nin-person or by phone.\nYou have within you a very potent form\nof shifting somebody else's neurology.\nNow, that's wonderful,\nand I think there are many\npeople like that out there.\nBut for many people who want to experience\nthe positive effects of gratitude,\nit's probably not the\nmost advantageous approach\nto just sit around waiting,\nhoping that someone's going to deliver\nall these letters or words of gratitude.\nHow is it that you can create\nthat sense of receiving\ngratitude for yourself\nand thereby derive the\neffects of gratitude\nas outlined in this particular study?\nAnd there we go back to the important work\nof the great Antonio Damasio\nwho explored these neural\ncorrelates of gratitude,\nto define the areas of the brain\nthat are associated with\npro-social behaviors\nlike the prefrontal cortex.\nAnd what's really\ninteresting about the work\nthat Demasio and colleagues\ndid is first of all,\nthey used functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging.\nSo this is a very high resolution approach\nto exploring what areas\nof the brain are active.\nAnd has very high, what we\ncall temporal resolution,\nmeaning you can see things\nin time at very fine scales.\nSo a lot of mechanistic detail,\nit can emerge from these sorts of studies.\nWhat they did was interesting.\nRather than have people express gratitude,\nthey had the subjects go into the scanner,\nso their brains are being imaged,\nand they watched narratives,\nstories about other people\nexperiencing positive\nthings in their life.\nAnd in this case, these\nwere powerful stories.\nThese were stories about\nsurvivors of genocide.\nSo that's what they're watching.\nThe subjects were subjects\nthat were not survivors of genocide.\nSo they were watching these videotapes\nof people that had genocide,\nand had people help them along the way\nas part of their story of survival,\neither psychological and/or...\nObviously they survive long\nenough to make the video.\nSo, or physical survival.\nSo within these stories,\nthere was a conveyance\nof a lot of struggle.\nThese people talked about\nthe horrible situations\nthey were in, but also\nsmall, but highly significant\nfeatures of their history that had led\nto their own feelings of gratitude.\nSo for instance, it says a woman at the...\nThis is literally from\nthe scientific paper.\nSomebody had been sick for weeks.\nSo the woman's describing how\nshe'd been sick for weeks.\nAnd then another prisoner who was a doctor\nfinds a particular medicine somehow,\nit doesn't describe how, and\nliterally saves her life.\nOr an ally who was also\nin a stricken circumstance\ngave this person a pair of glasses\nwhen their eyesight started to falter.\nSo these sorts of stories.\nNow just hearing this in the context\nof nothing but a scientific\npaper and discussion,\nthese probably aren't that impactful.\nWhat's really important about this study\nand is really important\nfor all of us to know\nis that these stories of\nother people receiving things\nthat were powerful for them\nin their life trajectory\nis embedded in story.\nAnd the human brain especially\nis so oriented towards story.\nWe have neural circuits\nthat like to link together\npast, present future,\nhave different characters,\nprotagonists and antagonists.\nFrom the time we're very young\nuntil the time we're very old,\nstory is one of the major ways\nthat we organize information in the brain.\nThere does seem to be storytelling\nand story listening circuits in the brain.\nSo what's important is not simply\nthat these people survived genocide.\nThat's obviously important and wonderful.\nBut it's not just that they\nwere helped along the way,\nit's that the description of their help\nis embedded in a larger story.\nSo the human subject in\nthis scientific study\nis watching these powerful stories.\nAnd the neural circuits associated\nwith pro-social behaviors\nand with gratitude become robustly active\nwhen they start to feel some affiliation\nwith the person telling the story.\nThey start to feel some resonance.\nWe might call that empathy,\nbut it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be empathy.\nEmpathy is a somewhat\ncomplicated thing to define\nbecause it involves\nliterally a setting aside\nof one's own emotions and\nreally focusing almost entirely,\nor experiencing almost entirely\nthe emotions of another.\nIt could be sympathy, it could be empathy.\nWhat we do know is that\nthe stories themselves\nwere able to shift the\nphysiology of the subjects\nin this study and activate these,\nwhat we're calling gratitude circuitry\nthat involves the prefrontal cortex.\nSo if you think about the earlier study\nthat receiving gratitude\nis the most powerful way\nto activate these circuits for gratitude,\nthe subjects in this study in many ways\nare receiving a sense of gratitude,\nbut through the narrative of\none of these other subjects.\nWhich I find fascinating.\nI would have thought a\ngreat gratitude practice\nis when you sit down and list out\nall the things you're grateful for.\nThat just seems so logical to me.\nBut it turns out\nthat these neurocircuits\ndon't work that way.\nThat to really activate\nthese circuits for gratitude\nin the serotonin and that probably\nthe oxytocin system as well,\nand its prefrontal networks,\none has to powerfully\nassociate with the idea\nof receiving help, okay?\nThe subjects are associating\nor experiencing empathy or sympathy\nfor somebody else who received help.\nIn the other study we\ndescribed a few minutes ago,\nthe person hearing the letter\nwas receiving gratitude,\nand that would amplify the\nactivity of these circuits.\nAnd that takes us to a larger theme of,\nwhat are these pro-social circuits?\nAnd an important concept\nto emerge from this\nis one that's most often associated\nwith the autism literature, frankly,\nwhich is this idea of theory of mind.\nSo just very briefly, theory of mind\nis the ability to attribute or\nto understand the experience\nof another without actually experiencing\nthe thing that they're experiencing.\nAgain, it kind of sounds like empathy,\nbut this was actually a term\nthat's now been demonstrated\nin the psychology and neuroscience,\nthat's been linked to\nsome very robust findings\nassociated with brain areas and so forth,\nthat was looking at autistic\nkids and non-autistic kids.\nThe person largely responsible\nfor developing theory of mind\nis Simon Baron-Cohen.\nI believe he's either the\nbrother or the cousin.\nI can't remember recall which,\nto the comedian Sasha Baron-Cohen.\nSimon Baron-Cohen is a\nprofessor at Oxford University,\nor at least he was the\nlast time I checked.\nAnd the theory of mind\ntest can be done on adults\nor on children.\nAnd we can sort of do\nthat experiment right now,\nif you like, and you can think\nabout how you would behave\nif you were a subject in\na theory of mind test.\nTheory of mind test\ninvolves you or a child\nor some other adults,\nsitting down and watching a video\nof a child going into a room\nor a person going into a room,\nopening up a desk or a\ndresser, a drawer for instance,\nor a desk drawer and\nplacing something in it,\nlike a pen or a toy, and then leaving.\nAnd then another person\nwalking into the room\nand clearly looking for\nsomething in the room,\nand one presumes it's the toy or the pen,\ndepending on the context.\nPeople who have strong theory of mind\nmake the obvious conclusion\nthat the person looking around\nfor the pen or the toy is\nconfused, or they're perplexed.\nThey don't know where the toy is,\nthey're looking for the toy.\nSomeone who is fairly far\nto one side of the autism\nor Asperger's spectrum will simply focus\non the location of the object,\non the location of the pen or the toy.\nAnd this is especially true in children.\nThey will say, well, it's\nin the second drawer,\nit's in the second drawer.\nAnd they'll say, well, how does the person\nwho comes into the room feel?\nAnd they'll say, well, it's in the drawer.\nSo they tend to focus on the\nspecific factual elements\nof the scenario rather\nthan place their mind\ninto the mind of the other person.\nSo-called theory of mind.\nNow that doesn't mean\nthat people with autism\nand Asperger's don't have empathy.\nIn some cases they can.\nIt sort of depends on where\nthey are in the spectrum\nand so forth.\nBut theory of mind has very strong basis\nin these prefrontal cortex neural circuits\nthat we were talking about.\nBecause, as you now know,\nthe prefrontal cortex sets context\non what we see and experience.\nAnd the theory of mind task\nthat I just described very\nbriefly is a pure example\nof context setting, right?\nIt's not about just the factual elements\nabout the location of the\nobjects, it's about the context.\nSomeone is looking for something\nthat someone else put someplace\nthat makes it such that\nthat object is hidden.\nSo basically theory of\nmind is your ability\nto put yourself into\nthe mindset of another.\nAnd in order to get activation\nof these gratitude circuits,\none needs to put themselves\ninto the mindset of another\nor to directly receive gratitude.\nSo let's just take a moment\nand start to think about\nhow we are going to build out\nthe ultimate gratitude practice;\nmeaning the most effective\ngratitude practice\nfor us to do because of all\nthe many positive effects\nthat an effective gratitude\npractice can have,\nif it's the proper one.\nIt's very clear that receiving\ngratitude is powerful,\nbut it's also very clear\nthat waiting around\nto receive that gratitude\nis an impractical approach.\nNow, there are methods\nthat have been developed\nby my colleague at Stanford,\nKelly McGonigal and others\nthat actually have developed\nthings for the workplace,\nfor school, for coworkers and students\nto write out particular\nworksheets related to\nwhat they're thankful for\nfrom others and exchange them.\nAnd so those are very useful practices.\nI don't want to take anything\naway from the important work\nthat Kelly and others have done.\nBut in the absence of having other people\nto do these practices with,\nwhat we know for sure\nis that there has to be a real experience\nof somebody else's experience.\nAnd that the best way to do that is story.\nSo, in thinking about how to build out\nan effective gratitude practice,\nit's very worthwhile, I believe,\nto find someone's narrative\nthat's powerful for you.\nAnd many ways to think about this is,\nit's got to be a story that inspires you\nbecause of the, for\nlack of a better phrase,\nthe beauty of the human spirit,\nor the ability of humans\nto help other humans.\nAnd I find this remarkable\nbecause what this really means\nis that the circuits for gratitude\nare such that we can exchange gratitude.\nWe can actually observe\nsomeone else getting help,\nsomeone else giving help.\nAnd that observation\nof our species doing that for one another,\nallows us to experience the\nfeeling of a genuine chemical\nand neural circuit\nactivation lift, if you will.\nVery, very different\nthan simply writing out\nthe things that you're\nthankful for, right?\nAnd so, how would you do this?\nWell, people digest story in\na number of different ways.\nPeople watch movies,\npeople listen to podcasts,\npeople read books.\nThere are a tremendous\nnumber of stories out there.\nIt's clear that an\neffective gratitude practice\nhas to be repeated from time to time.\nSo what I would not suggest\nis that we build a protocol\nin which you're constantly foraging\nfor inspirational stories\nover and over again.\nSocial media and the internet\nare replete with those.\nThat's not going to be a\nvery potent protocol or tool,\nbecause the most potent\nprotocol or tool for gratitude\nis going to be one that you\nrepeat over and over again.\nRather, the most\neffective protocol or tool\nis going to be either to think into,\nand you could write this out if you like,\nbut think into when somebody was thankful\nfor something that you did,\nand really start to\nthink about how you felt\nin receiving that gratitude,\nand/or I should say, imagining\nor thinking about deeply\nthe emotional experience of\nsomebody else receiving help.\nNow, what narrative you select\nis going to be very dependent\non you and your taste.\nIt's going to be very dependent\non what resonates with you.\nBut again, I want to\nemphasize that the story\nthat you select does not\nhave to have any semblance\nto your own life experience,\nis just about what happens to move you.\nAnd so, the way that one could do this,\nand actually I've started\nthis practice for myself\non the basis of the learnings\nI've had in the last few weeks\naround preparing for this episode,\nis to find a story that's\nparticularly meaningful for you.\nAnd then to just take some short notes,\nbullet point notes about\nmaybe list out for instance,\non just a small sheet of\npaper or in your phone,\nif that's your preference,\njust list out for instance,\nyou know, what the struggle was,\nwhat the help was,\nand something about how that\nimpacts you emotionally, okay?\nThis is something just for you.\nYou don't have to share it with anybody.\nThat kind of shorthand\nlist of bullet point notes\nserves as your shorthand\nfor getting into this mode\nthat we're calling gratitude.\nAnd actually closely mimics\na lot of what was done\nin these various studies.\nBecause even though the studies\nI've talked about up until now,\nwere really focused on what\nwe call acute imaging studies,\nwhere someone watched a\nstory or received gratitude\nwhile the experiment was done,\nand then that's it one and done.\nThere are other studies looking\nat gratitude in this context\nover many weeks, up to six weeks.\nAnd what one observes\nis that there's so-called\nneuroplasticity of these circuits.\nNeuroplasticity is the brain\nand nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience.\nAnd that these neural\ncircuits start developing\na familiarity with the narrative.\nSo that, for instance,\nlet's say you sit down the\nfirst time you've found a story\nthat you find particularly compelling.\nYou've written down a few notes\nabout what that story\nis just to remind you.\nAnd then you read those out\nand you think into the\nrichness of that experience,\nthat receiving of gratitude,\nor if you prefer you're doing the protocol\nwhere you're thinking about\nwhen someone was deeply grateful\nor was genuinely grateful to you,\nthat you're thinking about that.\nThe neural circuits become\nactivated more easily\nwith each subsequent\nrepeat of the practice.\nNow this can be done\nliterally for one minute\nor two minutes or three minutes.\nThis is not an extensively long practice.\nAnd that's another beauty\nof gratitude practices,\nis that they have these\nout-sized positive effects\non so many aspects of our physiology,\nbut these are very short practices.\nThey're the kind of thing that you can do\nwalking to your car.\nThe kind of thing you can\njust sit down for a minute\nand set a timer and do,\nbecause they are really\nabout changing your\nstate of mind and body.\nAnd if you have an experience\nof receiving gratitude\nor a story that's very potent for you,\nit becomes a sort of shortcut\ninto the gratitude network,\nthese pro-social networks.\nMeaning the activation of these circuits\nbecomes almost instantaneous.\nAnd that's very different\nthan a lot of other practices out there.\nI'm not aware of any meditation\npractices for instance,\nthat you can do only a few times,\nand then within a week or so,\nyou just have to do them for one minute.\nYou immediately drop into\nthe kind of optimal state\nthat that meditation practice\nis designed to create.\nThere are some shorter\nmeditation practices\nthat are very potent and\nvery effective like that.\nBut gratitude and the\ncircuits associated with it\nappear to be especially plastic;\nmeaning, especially prone to\nbeing able to be triggered,\nin the good sense of the word triggered,\njust by simply reminding yourself\nof this particular narrative.\nNow there's another very\nclear and positive effect\nof using this narrative\nor story-based approach\nto a gratitude practice.\nAnd that's what story\ndoes for our physiology.\nNow, earlier in the episode,\nI mentioned this really incredible study\nin which listening to a story\ncoordinated the heart rates\nof different individuals,\nand literally changed the way\nthat their heart was beating.\nThe title of the study\nis conscious processing\nof narrative stimulate synchronizes\nheart rate between individuals.\nThe first author is Perez,\nagain, published in Cell Reports,\nCell Press journal, excellent journal.\nAnd it's a really elegant study.\nThey looked at instantaneous heart rate.\nThey use electrocardiogram to do that,\nwhich is simply a way\nto look at heart beats\nwith very fine precision.\nThey also looked at the\nbreathing of subjects\nas they listened to the stories.\nSome of you may know that\nbreathing and heart rate\nare actually linked to one another\nin a really interesting way.\nThe simple way to put it\nis that when you inhale,\nyour heart rate speeds up a little bit,\nand when you exhale, your\nheart rate slows down.\nAnd this is because of the\nmovement of the diaphragm\nin your thoracic cavity.\nAnd the physicians and medical types\ncall this respiratory sinus arrhythmia.\nThere's a mechanism\nthere we could get into,\nbut I don't want to distract\nus from the main theme here.\nSo just remember when you inhale,\nyour heart rate speeds up,\nand when you exhale, your\nheart rate slows down.\nThey looked at breathing,\nthey looked at heart rates\nin different individuals.\nAnd listening to a story\nproduced very consistent\ngaps between the heart rates\nof the people who are listening,\ndifferent individuals in the study\nwho were not located in the same place\nwhen they listened to the story,\nlistening to the story on different times,\ndifferent days entirely had\nvery similar heartbeat patterns\nlistening to the story.\nWhat this means for\nyour gratitude practice\nis that having a story\nthat you can return to\nover and over again, even if\nit's not the entire story,\nyou're just using the\nshorthand bullet point\nversion of your story,\nwill create a perceptible\nand real shift in your\nheartbeat and in your breathing.\nAnd actually that's been\ndemonstrated over and over now\nthat an effective\ngratitude practice is one\nthat can rapidly shift,\nnot just the activation of\nthese circuits in your brain\nfor pro-social behaviors,\nbut also activation of\nparticular circuits in your heart\nand in your lungs and the\nother organs of your body,\nsuch that you can get\ninto a reproducible state\nof gratitude each time.\nSo an important component here is that,\nthere be some element of story,\nagain, you don't have to listen to or read\nor think about the entire\nstory, start to finish\nin order to extract these benefits,\nand that it be the same\nstory over and over.\nAnd as a consequence, that's\ngoing to shift your physiology\ninto presumably a more relaxed state,\nbecause typically that's the one\nthat's associated with gratitude.\nAlthough activation of\nthese gratitude circuits\nhas also been shown to create\nsense of awe or sense of joy.\nThere are few studies looking at\nand kind of parsing the difference\nbetween gratitude and joy.\nI was able to find a\nfew studies about that.\nBut in general, the neural\ncircuits that are activated\ntend to overlap quite a lot with those\nthat create a sense of gratitude.\nSo we don't want to split\nhairs on necessarily there.\nThe key thing is that you\nwant to use the same story,\neven if it's your own\nexperience or somebody else's,\nand keep coming back to\nit over and over again.\nThat makes it a very potent tool\nthat you can get a tremendous\namount of benefit from\nwith even as short as\n60 seconds of practice.\nEarlier, I talked about how\nyou can't lie to yourself\nand say, you know, I'm so\ngrateful for this thing\nthat I actually hate.\nAnd in a moment, I'm going to tell you\nabout some scientific data that proves\nthe statement I made is true,\nand that you can't just lie to yourself\nand derive the benefits\nof a gratitude practice.\nThe data are also going\nto point to the fact that,\nif you are giving gratitude,\nnot just receiving it,\nbut giving gratitude, that\ntoo has to be genuine.\nThere's a really interesting studies\npublished in scientific reports,\nwhich is a nature research journal.\nThe title of it is Neural\nResponses to Intention\nand Benefit Appraisal are Critical\nin Distinguishing Gratitude and Joy.\nIt's a somewhat complicated study,\nso I'm just going to hit\non some of the high points.\nBut basically what they did\nis they use functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging.\nSo they could look at\nbrain circuitry activation\nwith very high precision.\nAnd they had people receiving money\nin the context of this experiment.\nAnd they had some knowledge\nas to whether or not\nthe money that they were receiving\nwas given to them\nwholeheartedly or reluctantly.\nAnd there were a number of\ndifferent variables in the study,\nincluding how much money was given.\nSo in some cases it was very little,\nin other cases, it was modest,\nin other cases, it was a lot more.\nAnd they also varied the extent\nto which the giver of the\nmoney, called the benefactor,\nwas doing it wholeheartedly\nor seem to be doing it\nsomewhat reluctantly.\nAnd they looked at whether\nor not the sense of gratitude\nscaled with the amount of money received\nand/or the intention of the benefactor.\nWhether or not the person giving the money\nwas doing it wholeheartedly\nor reluctantly.\nAnd what's remarkable\nis that while the amount of money given\nwas a strong component in\nwhether or not somebody felt\nthat they had received\ngratitude, which makes sense,\nyou know, the amount\nof money is some metric\nof whether or not somebody feels thanked.\nThe stronger variable, the\nbigger impact came from\nwhether or not the person giving the money\nwas giving it with a\nwholehearted intention\nand not a reluctant intention.\nAnd of course, there was an interaction\nwhere the best circumstance of course,\nis where the person\nreceived a lot of money\nfrom somebody who wholeheartedly\nwanted to give them a lot of money.\nAnd they did every derivation of this.\nBut this is of important.\nThis tells us many things\nthat extend way beyond\ngratitude practices,\nwhich is that, genuine\nthanks are what count.\nOkay?\nWe could probably presume that.\nBut receiving genuine thanks\nis also a strong variable\nin determining whether or not\nwe experience real gratitude,\nor whether or not it's empty,\nregardless of the size of a gift.\nSo this constrains our\ngratitude practices somewhat,\nbut I think in an interesting\nand important way,\nyou can't make this stuff up.\nYou can't tell yourself\nthat an experience was great\nor that I got a lot of money\nand therefore it justified it,\neven though I think that they\ngive it to me reluctantly,\nor my boss hates me, but\nthey gave me a raise.\nThat stuff stings for\nall the right reasons,\nbecause there are circuits\nin our brain and body\nthat are oriented towards\nthese pro-social interactions.\nAnd in some sense, what we\nare looking for as a species,\nwhat these circuits want, if you will,\nis to receive things from people\nthat are giving them wholeheartedly.\nAnd that tells us that\nif we are the giver,\nthat we better be giving wholeheartedly,\nor we are undermining\nthe sense of gratitude\nthat someone is going to receive from us.\nSo we are gradually building up\nthe ultimate gratitude practice\nbased on the variety of\nscientific literature\nthat's out there.\nAnd I know that many people\nare probably interested\nin developing a gratitude\npractice that has long lasting,\nmaybe even permanent positive effects\non their neural circuitry.\nSo with that in mind, I\nwant to turn our attention\nto a really interesting study.\nIt's entitled effects\nof gratitude meditation\non neural network functional connectivity\nand brain heart coupling.\nAnd to make a long story\nshort and a lot simpler\nthan that title,\nrepeated gratitude practice\nchanges the way that\nyour brain circuits work.\nAnd it also changes the\nway in which your heart\nand your brain interact.\nYou're familiar with the fact\nthat your brain controls your heart\nbecause you could be\nstressed about something\nthat's perceived with your brain,\nand then your heart rate will speed up.\nYou're probably also\nfamiliar with the fact\nthat if your heart rate speeds up\nfor some reason or no reason,\nyou're probably thinking,\nwell, what's making my\nheart rate speed up?\nAnd that's because the brain and the heart\nare reciprocally innervated, as we say.\nThey're talking to one\nanother in both directions.\nIt's a two way highway.\nThis study looked at changes\nin so-called functional\nconnectivity within the brain\nand between the brain and the heart,\nin response to gratitude practices.\nAnd as a control they used,\nwhat I think is very interesting,\na resentment intervention.\nI think resentment is an apt control\nand quite different than gratitude.\nTo make a long story\nshort, what they found\nis that a repeated gratitude practice\ncould change the resting\nstate functional connectivity\nin emotion and\nmotivation-related brain regions.\nIf I haven't mentioned a\nstrong enough incentive\nfor doing a regular\ngratitude practice until now,\nthis is definitely the\none to pay attention to.\nBecause what they found was\na regular gratitude practice\ncould shift the functional\nconductivity of emotion pathways\nin ways that made\nanxiety and fear circuits\nless likely to be active,\nand circuits for feelings of wellbeing,\nbut also motivation to\nbe much more active.\nI find that remarkable and important\nbecause a number of people struggle\nwith issues of motivation.\nA lot of people who are highly motivated\nalso have issues with anxiety and fear.\nAnd so this study really\npoints to the fact\nthat it's a twofer.\nIf you have a good gratitude practice\nand you repeat it regularly,\nyou reduce the fear, anxiety circuits,\nyou increase the efficacy\nof the positive emotion,\nfeel good circuits,\nand the circuits associated\nwith motivation and pursuit\nare actually enhanced as well.\nSo that's very strong incentive\nto have a gratitude practice\nand one that you use regularly.\nWe'll talk about how\nregularly in just a moment.\nI don't want to go into too\nmany details of the study,\nalthough we will put a\nreference to it if you like.\nIt includes a lot of fMRI data,\nimaging data of different brain areas,\nmany, many tables and examples of matrices\nof before and after gratitude,\nafter resentment, et cetera,\nyou do indeed have circuits\nin your brain for resentment,\nwhether you like it or not, we all do.\nAnd some people,\njust those circuits are\nmore robust than others.\nBut the remarkable thing is\none can shift these circuits\nin the direction that I\nthink most people would like;\nwhich is more sense of\nwellbeing and motivation\nand less resentment and fear literally.\nAnd what's really cool\nabout this study also\nis that the interventions\nare only five minutes long.\nIt's incredible, five minutes long.\nAnd so, as we start to build out\nour ideal gratitude practice,\nwe know that it has to\nhave certain features.\nFirst of all, it has to\nbe grounded in a story,\nprobably a story that you've heard\nin its entirety at least once.\nBut then you can have a shorthand version,\nthe so-called bullet points\nthat I talked about before\nthat allow you to drop into that story\nor the emotional\nassociations with that story.\nSo you don't have to listen\nto the whole story each time.\nAnd that story should be one\nin which you are genuinely\nbeing thanked for something\nand it made you feel good,\nor it could be a story about\nsomeone else genuinely\nexpressing thanks, okay?\nBased on the description\nof the gratitude practices\nthat we talked about earlier.\nYour gratitude practice can be very brief.\nI mean, it be as brief as\none minute, 60 seconds,\nor five minutes, which still\nseems very brief to me.\nAlthough in these studies,\nthey were getting these\nreally major effects\njust from five minutes\nof gratitude practice.\nSome of these papers involve\npeople doing some focusing\non their breathing and calming themselves\nas they go into the gratitude practice,\nbut that's within the five minute block.\nSo if you decide that you're going to do\na gratitude practice\nthat involves first doing\nsome calming breathing,\nexhale emphasized breathing, for instance,\nor physiological size, things\nI've talked about before\non this podcast that can help calm me down\n'cause they have a lot of\nexhales, which you now know,\nslows your heart rate down,\nand then doing your gratitude\npractice, that's fine.\nIt's actually not necessary,\nbut a lot of these studies used that.\nI think once a narrative has been set,\nyou've heard the story and\nit has meaning for you,\nor you have a recollection of a story\nwhere you are genuinely thanked,\nthen I think just 60\nseconds or maybe 120 seconds\nshould be sufficient.\nThen the question becomes,\nhow often to repeat\nthis gratitude practice.\nThat's not exactly clear\nfrom the existing literature.\nI can't point to any one study\nthat says five times a week\nor four times a week.\nSo I'm going to throw out a number\nwhich is three times a week,\nand then people will ask,\nwell, when should I do\nthat gratitude practice?\nAnd I'll tell you what I tell everybody\nabout almost every practice\nwith a few exceptions,\nwhich is the best time of\nday to do this practice\nis when you first wake up in the morning,\nor before you go to sleep at\nnight, or any time of day.\nSo we've talked about some\nof the neurocircuitry changes\nassociated with a regular\ngratitude practice.\nAnd I should mention\nthat there's an additional\nneurocircuitry shift that occurs.\nIt relates to a structure that I mentioned\njust briefly earlier,\nwhich is the so-called ACC\nor anterior cingulate cortex.\nThis is an area of the brain\nthat has several functions,\nbut more and more data\nare pointing to the fact\nthat the ACC is actually\ninvolved in empathy\nand is involved in understanding\nthe emotional states\nof others in general,\neven if it doesn't evoke\na sense of empathy.\nAnd there are several studies\nthat point to the fact\nthat in humans who have a\nregular gratitude practice,\nthe ACC becomes more robustly engaged,\neven with these very\nbrief gratitude practices.\nWe actually have a project in our lab.\nThis is actually done in animal models,\nwhere animals observe other animals\nexperiencing certain emotional states.\nAnd one of the brain areas\nthat we've identified\nas important for this;\nit's kind of a primordial form of empathy\n'cause we really don't know\nwhat these mice are thinking.\nWe work on humans, in the\ncase where we work on humans,\nof course we ask them and they tell us\nwhat they think they're thinking.\nWith the mice, we ask them,\nbut they don't tell us much\nof anything interesting.\nInstead we measure a number\nof physiological signals.\nBut the important point is that the ACC,\nthe anterior cingulate cortex\nseems to be an important hub\nfor the generation and\nexecution of empathy\nas it relates to feelings\nand empathic behaviors;\naltruistic behaviors of\nanimals helping animals\nand humans helping other humans.\nWe see this in the animal\nmodels, we see this in humans.\nSo, if you want to be\na more empathic person,\na gratitude practice\nis also going to be very\neffective for that, it appears,\nespecially using this\nnarrative type approach\nwhere you are using\nsomeone else's narrative\nof receiving gratitude\nas a way to tap into your\nown sense of gratitude.\nThus far, we've mainly talked\nabout the effects of gratitude\non neural circuit activation,\nand changes a little bit\nabout some of the changes\nthat are happening in terms of the body,\nheart rate and breathing and so forth.\nBut we haven't talked a\nlot yet about the changes\nin health metrics, in\nthings like inflammation\nor reductions in inflammation and immunity\nand things of that sort.\nSo with that in mind, I'd\nlike to describe the results\nof a really interesting recent\nstudy that was published\nin the journal Brain\nBehavior and Immunity.\nThis was published 2021.\nThe title of the study is,\nExploring Neural Mechanisms\nof the Health Benefits\nof Gratitude in Women: A\nRandomized Control Trial.\nThe first author is Hazlitt.\nAnd basically, what this paper showed\nwas that women who had a\nregular gratitude practice\nof the sort that we've been\ntalking about up until now,\nshowed reductions in amygdala activity;\na brain area associated\nwith threat detection,\na intimate part of the\nfear network in the brain.\nSo reductions in amygdala activation,\nand large reductions in the production\nof something called TNF-alpha,\ntumor necrosis factor alpha,\nand IL-6, interleukin six.\nNow, if you happen to have\nlistened to the episode\nthat I did on activating\nyour immune system\nand immune function, you heard\nabout TNF-alpha and IL-6.\nTNF-alpha and IL six are\ninflammatory cytokines.\nThese are chemicals\nthat exist in your body,\nand that are released from\ncells when there is damage\nor kind of a systemic stress;\nwhen your system is in duress.\nAnd in the short-term,\nthey can be beneficial.\nThey can call in signals for wound healing\nand repair of cells, et cetera,\nbut you don't want TNF-alpha\nand IL-6 levels to be too high,\nand you don't want those\nlevels to be up for too long.\nAnd so, this study is really nice\nbecause they showed significant effects\nin reducing TNF-alpha and IL-6\nin response to a gratitude practice.\nAnd because they also observed reductions\nin amygdala activation,\nthis area associated with\nthreat detection and fear,\nit's likely, and I\nshould emphasize likely,\n'cause I don't know,\nthat the direction of the effect\nis that there are neural circuit changes,\nwhich in turn shift the degree\nto which these inflammatory cytokines\nare released in the body.\nAlthough for all I know, it\ncould be the other way too.\nIt could be that having\na gratitude practice\nshifts something about\nheart rate and breathing,\nwhich in turn lowers the\namount of TNF-alpha and IL-6,\nand that in turn reduces\nactivation of the amygdala.\nWe don't really know the direction\nof the effect, excuse me,\nbut if I had to speculate,\nI would speculate\nthat it was a shift in neural circuitry\nthat led to a change in\nthe circuits of the body.\nAnd another interesting\naspect of this study\nis that the reductions\nin amygdala activation\nand the reductions in TNF-alpha\nand IL-6 were very rapid.\nThey occurred almost immediately\nafter the gratitude\npractice was completed.\nAnd even though that study was performed\nexclusively on female subjects,\nbased on the biology and\ncircuitry of the amygdala\nand the biology of TNF-alpha and IL-6\nperforming this inflammatory\nrole in both men and women,\nI don't see any reason\nwhy the results of that\nstudy wouldn't pertain\nto both men and women.\nSo what about the chemistry\nassociated with gratitude?\nAre there certain chemicals in our brain\nor that we could enhance in our brain\nthat would enhance our gratitude practice?\nIndeed, there are.\nAnd earlier I mentioned the chemical,\nthe neuromodulator serotonin\nas having a powerful influence\non the activation of neural circuits\nassociated pro-social\nbehaviors and gratitude,\nand other sort of feel good behaviors.\nTo make a long story short,\nneuromodulators like\ndopamine and epinephrine\nand norepinephrine tend\nto place us into a state\nof external perception,\nmeaning a state of observing\nthings and focusing on things\noutside the immediate reach of our body\nand confines of our skin.\nThey tend to put us in pursuit,\nor in thinking about\nthings out in the future\nor out away from our physical body.\nWhereas the neuromodulators serotonin\nand some of the associated\npathways like oxytocin\nand other neurochemicals\ntend to, I want to emphasize,\ntend to be associated with\nstates that are about contentment\nwith what we have within\nthe confines of our body\nand our immediate experience.\nSo they're not so much about pursuit,\nbut about gratitude and about appreciation\nfor what we already have.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't\ntherefore point out\nthat if one were to shift their chemistry\ntoward having higher levels of serotonin,\nyou would, by all logic,\nexperience heightened levels of gratitude.\nAnd indeed some people do this.\nThey will take compounds\nthat increase serotonin.\nThere are a number of compounds\nout there, as you know.\nI'm certainly not\nsuggesting people do that.\nA couple of the supplement based legal,\nover-the-counter approaches to this\nare things like 5-HTP, which\nis a precursor to serotonin.\nSome people will take 5-HTP\nto try and enhance their sleep.\nI'm not a fan of doing that, personally.\nI've talked about this\nin the sleep episodes.\nBut the state that we call\nsleep has a very complex\nand important architecture as\nit relates to neurochemicals.\nAnd by taking serotonin by supplement\nor by stimulating serotonin\nrelease by supplement\nwith 5-HTP or with tryptophan,\nwhich is an amino acid\nprecursor to serotonin,\none can run into the problem\nof disrupting the normal\narchitecture of sleep cycles\nthroughout the night.\nI experienced that as, if I've\ntaken 5-HTP or tryptophan,\nI fall asleep very deeply,\nbut then I wake up three hours later\nand I can't fall asleep at all.\nAnd actually it sometimes\neven messes up my sleep\nthe subsequent night.\nSome people are not so\nsensitive to 5-HTP in tryptophan\nand they actually really like it.\nSo again, you have to talk to your doctor,\ndecide what's right for you.\nYou're responsible for\nyour health, not me.\nAnd you have to determine\nwhat works for you.\nEveryone's slightly individual.\nBut one could imagine enhancing\ntheir amount of serotonin\nin their brain and body by\ntaking 5-HTP or tryptophan\nbefore a gratitude practice,\nthat seems a little bit extreme\ngiven that the gratitude\npractice is only about a minute\nto five minutes long on a regular basis,\nbut there may be instances\nin which you're really trying\nto amplify the circuitry\nin the brain and body that\nare associated with gratitude,\nand therefore that might be something\nthat you want to explore.\nThere's a new compound that's out there.\nA legal over-the-counter compound.\nAt least it's legal in the United States,\nI don't know about overseas.\nAnd that's a compound\ncalled Kanna, K-A-N-N-A.\nIt's an interesting compound.\nIt goes by another name as well, which is,\nand I'm going to mispronounce\nthis and I apologize,\nthis is Sceletium tortuosum.\nPlease see our timestamps\nif you want to see the spelling of that.\nBut I'll just call it Kanna,\nby its other name for short.\nIt's an herb that is traditionally chewed\nprior to stressing endeavors,\nis how it's described on an examine.com.\nBut I looked at some\nof the studies on this.\nIt's kind of interesting.\nIt very likely increases the\namount of serotonin in the body\nand pretty potently.\nIt is generally taken in dosages\nof anywhere from 25 to 50 milligrams.\nAnd it creates a kind of a\npro-social gratitude enhancing,\nor I should say gratitude circuitry\npro-social neurocircuitry enhancing effect\nbecause of the ways that it interacts\nwith the certain urgent\npathways of the brain.\nSo it also has another name,\nit's sometimes called\nZembrin, Z-E-M-B-R-I-N.\nAgain, I'm not suggesting\nthat people run out\nand take this stuff.\nBut there is an emerging practice\nof people using Zembrine,\nSceletium tortuosum,\nalso called Kanna, K-A-N-N-A,\nin order to enhance the\nstates that are about comfort\nand pleasure with what one has\nin their immediate sphere of experience.\nAnd so one could imagine\nif it's safe for you and right for you\nand legal where you live\nin enhancing serotonin\nby taking Kanna and then\ndoing your gratitude practice.\nWhat's the logic behind that?\nWell, oftentimes we hear about\nsupplements and pharmacology\nfor \"increasing plasticity\"\nor \"opening plasticity.\"\nYou know, if I had a dollar\nfor every time someone said,\nI hear that such and\nsuch opens plasticity.\nWell, indeed there are molecules\nassociated with the thing\nthat we call neuroplasticity.\nBut neuroplasticity is not\nan event, it's a process;\nmeaning it has many, many steps.\nIt occurs during wakefulness,\nit's consolidated during\nsleep and so forth.\nTaking a substance that increases\na neurochemical in your brain will likely,\nprovided it's the right substance\nand it's the right practice,\nwill likely enhance the\namplitude or the intensity\nof that practice and make\nit a more potent form\nof inducing neuroplasticity.\nMeaning it will create longer lasting\nor more robust brain changes\nthan if one hadn't increased\ntheir chemistry in this way,\nthis way of taking something.\nBut that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you couldn't get to the\nvery same place without it,\nby simply doing a slightly\nlonger attitude practice\nor putting a little bit\nmore mental effort into it.\nThat said, I think the\nfuture of neuroplasticity\nreally resides in not just one approach,\nnot just neurochemistry\nand taking substances\nto increase neuroplasticity,\nnot just behavioral practices\nto try and increase neuro-plasticity,\nnot just brain machine interfaces\nor devices to increase neuro-plasticity,\nbut rather the convergence\nof multiple tools.\nSo you could imagine enhancing\nserotonergic transmission,\nas we say in the brain\nusing something like Kanna,\ncombined with a gratitude practice.\nIn the not-too-distant future,\nthis will probably also be combined\nwith some sort of noninvasive device\nto stimulate the prefrontal\ncortex at the same time.\nPlease don't do that recreationally.\nThose devices are for\nclinical use only currently.\nBut I think you start to get the idea.\nSo for those of you that are\na little bit more exploratory\nand you want to go in and\ndo some reading on this,\nI thought you might\nfind Kanna interesting.\nI certainly did.\nThere are a number of studies\nthat will pop up on PubMed.\nI recommend using examine.com\nas your jumping off point.\nThere are some decent studies\nthat they described in their\nso-called human effect matrix.\nSo those are studies done on humans.\nAnd the main effects\nthat have been documented\nin the scientific literature are minor,\nbut significant increases in\ncognition, executive function.\nExecutive function is something\nthat's also associated\nwith prefrontal cortex,\nand reductions in anxiety.\nAnd that seems to be a common theme\nthat we're seeing again and again.\nYou saw this in the study,\nthe trial where we saw\nreductions in TNF-alpha\nand reductions amygdala activation.\nWhich would ostensibly lead\nto reductions in anxiety.\nYou're seeing increases in\nactivity in brain networks\nthat are associated with\nfeelings of wellbeing.\nSo again, back to that kind of push-pull\nof defensive anxiety and\nfear-like circuitry in the brain\nbeing antagonistic, as we say,\nto the circuits that are\nassociated with pro-social,\nfeeling good, receiving good feelings,\ntype circuitry and events in life.\nSo as you now know,\nthere is a lot of science\nabout how gratitude can positively impact\nneural circuits in the brain.\nAnti-inflammatory markers in the body,\nbrain-heart breathing\ncoordination, and on and on and on.\nI'd like to just\nhighlight the key elements\nof the most effective,\nat least to my knowledge,\ngratitude practice.\nAnd when I say the most effective,\nwhat I'm doing is I'm gleaning\nfrom the scientific studies\nI was able to find and\ncombining the various findings\nof those studies into what\nI think is a very practical,\nand what should certainly\nbe a very effective\ngratitude practice\nfor all the positive\neffects that we described.\nFirst of all, that gratitude practice\nhas to be grounded in a\nnarrative, meaning a story.\nYou don't have to recite\nor hear that story\nevery single time you do\nthe gratitude practice,\nbut you have to know what that story was\nand what the gratitude\npractice references back to.\nSecond of all, that story can be one\nof you receiving genuine thanks.\nAnd the key elements there\nare that you are the one\nreceiving the thanks,\nthe gratitude,\nand that it's being given to\nyou genuinely, wholeheartedly.\nOr it can be a story of\nyou observing someone else\nreceiving thanks or expressing thanks.\nAnd that has to be a\ngenuine interaction as well,\nboth between the giver and the receiver.\nSo, those are the first three elements.\nWhat I recommend would be\nafter you've established\nthe story that you want to use\nfor your gratitude practice,\nthat you write down three\nor four simple bullet points\nthat can serve as salient\nreminders of that story for you,\nit will serve as kind\nof a cue for that story\nwithout having to listen to,\nor talk out the entire story.\nI would recommend writing down something\nabout the state that you\nor the other person were in\nbefore they received the gratitude,\nthe state that you were in\nor that the person was in\nafter they received the gratitude,\nand any other elements\nthat lend some sort of emotional weight\nor tone to the story.\nThis could be three pages\nof text, if you like,\nor it could just be a\ncouple of bullet points.\nI don't think it really matters.\nThe important thing is that\nit's embedded in your memory\nand that it's really associated\nwith this genuine exchange of thanks,\nand the receival of things.\nI think those are the key elements.\nAnd then it's very simple:\nThe entire practice involves\nreading off these bullet points\nas a cue to your nervous system\nof the sense of gratitude.\nAnd then for about one minute,\nwhich is a trivial amount of time\nif you really think about\nit, or maybe two minutes,\nor if you're really\nambitious up to five minutes\nof just really feeling into\nthat genuine experience\nof having received gratitude\nor observed someone else\nreceiving gratitude.\nAnd then in terms of frequency,\nI think a good rule of thumb\nwould be to do that\nabout three times a week.\nAnd the time of day doesn't really matter.\nI can't see why there would be\nany so-called circadian effects of this.\nI know some people like\nto do a gratitude practice\nbefore they go to sleep at night.\nI don't see any problem with doing this\nbefore you go to sleep at night.\nI also don't see any\nproblem with you doing this\non your lunch break or mid-morning\nor first thing in the morning.\nI can't see any logic for\nplacing it at any one time of day\nand not another.\nSo I think the most important thing\nis that you do it at\nleast three times a week.\nAnd as mentioned before,\nit's very, very brief.\nSo there are very few barriers\nto entry for doing this.\nSo if we just take a step\nback from this protocol\nand compare it to what's\ntypically out there\nin the literature, which is,\nmake a list of all the\nthings you're thankful for,\nrecite in your mind all the\nthings you're thankful for,\ncount your blessings.\nSo I think everybody should\nbe counting their blessings\nall the time.\nThere's always something\nto be thankful for.\nBut in terms of a scientifically\ngrounded gratitude practice\nthat has also scientifically demonstrated\nto shift your physiology at\nthe level of your immune system\nand your look neurocircuitry,\nreducing anxiety, increasing motivation,\nall these wonderful\nthings that so many of us\nare chasing all the time as goals,\nI think a gratitude\npractice reveals itself\nto be an immensely powerful tool\nfor any and all of us to use.\nAnd that should come as no surprise\nbecause these pro-social\ncircuits for gratitude\nare not a recent phenomenon.\nDiscussions about gratitude\ndate back hundreds,\nif not thousands of years.\nWhat we've done today is\nto take the modern science\nright up until 2021,\nand to really distill from\nthat the neuroimaging data,\nthe neurochemistry, the various aspects\nof brain-body connectivity,\nlook at the protocols,\ntake various subject groups.\nSome were done in women,\nsome were done between two individuals,\nsome were done with brain imaging,\nall the various changes on a theme\nthat allow us to point to a simple,\nbut very effective protocol\nthat certainly we could all use\naround Thanksgiving.\nBut Thanksgiving is just, but one day\nthroughout the entire year, of course.\nI personally have been\nusing a gratitude protocol\nfor the last several years.\nBut that protocol was based\non my ignorance, really,\nabout the scientific literature,\nand was mainly based\non what I'd heard out\nthere in the internet,\nwhich is that I should\nlist out or think about,\nor verbally recite the\nthings that I'm grateful for.\nThe sort of protocol\nthat we arrived at today\nbased on the scientific literature\nis distinctly different from that.\nAnd as a consequence,\nI've started to script out\na protocol identical to\nthe one I just described,\nand I intend to use that going forward.\nIf you're learning from\nand/or enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nThat's a terrific zero\ncost way to support us.\nIn addition, please subscribe\nto us on
