    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are discussing\nthe immune system,\nand we are also discussing\nthe nervous system,\nwhich is the brain, spinal cord,\nand the connections of\nthe brain and spinal cord\nwith all the organs of the body.\nWe are also going to discuss\nhow the nervous system can be\nused to activate and\ncontrol the immune system.\nNow, about 10, 20 years ago,\nif somebody said that\nthe mind could control\nthe immune system, they'd\nprobably get laughed out\nof most academic conferences.\nAnd certainly the work\nwouldn't be published\nin quality journals, but\nnowadays there are dozens,\nif not hundreds of quality\npeer-reviewed studies\non how the mind and how the nervous system\ncan control activation\nof the immune system.\nThis is a wonderful\ngrowing body of research.\nAnd just to give you a hint of\nwhere we are headed with\nthis, just this last week,\nthere was a paper published in \"Nature\"\nwhich is the apex journal\nfor scientific publishing,\npremiere journal, extremely stringent,\na paper published in \"Nature\"\nfrom Qiufu Ma's lab at\nHarvard Medical School,\nexplored how acupuncture can reduce\ninflammation in the body.\nAnd I will describe this study\nin a bit more detail later,\nbut what they discovered was\nthat by stimulating the body\nin particular ways at\nparticular sites on the body,\nthey were able to liberate\ncertain cells and molecules\nthat enhance the function\nof the immune system,\nand potentially can be used to combat\ndifferent types of infection.\nAnd just to give you another little hint,\nthey found that a particular\ntype of organ tissue\ncalled fascia, some of you\nmay have heard of fascia,\nfascia surrounds our muscles.\nJust to look at it,\nyou might think it's a\nkind of useless tissue,\nit's sort of like a dense bag\nin which the muscles are contained.\nWell, it turns out that those dense bags\nare much smarter than we thought.\nThey don't have a mind of their own,\nbut by stimulating the fascia\nin a particular location on the body,\nthere's a pathway leading\nout of that fascia\ndirectly to an organ\ncalled the adrenal medulla,\nI'll explain what all this means,\nthat could liberate particular chemicals\nthat had a potent\nanti-inflammatory effect.\nSo what we're basically saying\nis that the nervous system\nacts as a set of highways\nbetween the different\ntissues of your body,\ncalling into action the immune system,\nliberating particular molecules\nthat can reduce inflammation\nand lead to faster healing.\nAnd I will explain how all of that works\nas well as some other\nnon-acupuncture methods\nfor activating and enhancing the function\nof the immune system.\nSo, today, we're going\nto be talking all about\nhealing with the mind in\na completely non-mystical,\nnon-abstract sense.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are absolute suburb quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system,\nand I can tell you that\none of the major issues\nour visual system has to contend with\nis how to see things clearly\nin bright environments\nor dimmer environments, et cetera.\nROKA clearly understands the\nscience of the visual system,\nbecause one thing that's\nwonderful about their sunglasses\nis that you can be in a\nvery bright environment\nand then walk into a shadowed environment\nand you don't even notice the transition.\nEverything is still seen\nwith crystal clarity.\nTheir eyeglasses as well\nallow you to see things\nregardless of how bright or\ndim internal lighting is.\nI wear readers at night, I\nwear sunglasses during the day,\nand ROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses are particularly nice\nbecause they're very lightweight,\nso I often forget that\nthey're even on my face.\nThey also don't slip\noff if you get sweaty.\nThey were actually designed to be used\nwhile running or cycling.\nAnd so I can use them while exercising.\nThey also have a great aesthetic.\nSo you can go from exercising,\nto dinner or to work,\nwithout having to change\nfrom one set of glasses to the next.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nglasses, you can go to roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code \"Huberman\"\nto save 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one vitamin,\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012.\nAnd so, I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice per day is\nbecause it allows me to cover\nall of my basic nutritional bases.\nIt's got the vitamins and\nminerals that make sure\nthat no matter what I'm eating,\nI'm covering all of my\nmicronutrient bases.\nAnd it has the probiotics,\nand probiotics we now know are essential\nfor a healthy gut microbiome.\nAnd a healthy gut microbiome\nwe know is essential\nfor many important biological functions\nrelated to human health,\nlike metabolic needs,\nendocrine function, immune\nfunction, and so on.\nWith Athletic Greens, I\ncan mix that up with water.\nI usually add some lemon or lime juice.\nIt tastes delicious.\nI like it very much and I'll\ndrink it once early in the day,\nand once again later in the afternoon.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs,\nwhich make it very easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens,\nwhether you're in the car, or\non a plane, or on the move,\nand they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nThere is now a lot of data\nshowing that vitamin D3\nis important for many biological functions\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health.\nAnd most people do not\nget enough vitamin D3,\neven if they're getting a lot of sunshine.\nAnd K2 is also important or\nhas been shown to be important\nfor heart health and for blood\nlipid function, et cetera.\nSo, again, if you'd like\nto try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman\nto get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs,\nand the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better meet your immediate\nand long-term health goals.\nI've long been a fan of\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the things\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nThere's just simply no\nother body surface marker\nthat you can look at\nsomebody or yourself and say,\n\"Ah, I know that my blood lipids\nor my cholesterol are good,\nor that my hormone levels are X, Y, or Z.\"\nWe really need numbers on those things\nto know where they sit.\nThe problem with a lot\nof blood tests, however,\nis you get all those numbers back,\nyou don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nInsideTracker has solved that problem,\nand they have a very easy to use dashboard\nwhere when you get your numbers back,\nit can tell you for instance,\nwhere your numbers are\nhigh or low or on target.\nAnd they can suggest very\nspecific dietary intervention,\nsupplemental interventions,\nand behavioral interventions\nthat can allow you to bring those numbers\nto where you would like them to be.\nSo they've simplified the whole process.\nAnd in terms of getting the blood tests,\nyou can go to a local center\nto get the blood drawn,\nor they can even send\nsomebody to your house.\nSo, they've made the whole\nthing very, very easy\nfrom start to finish.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nYou just use the code\n\"Huberman\" at checkout.\nOkay, let's talk about the immune system,\nand the nervous system,\nand how the two interact,\nand how you can control your immune system\nto serve you better.\nWe are going to talk a lot\nof mechanistic science,\na little bit of detail,\nyou'll learn some new language\naround the immune system;\nnames of the different\ncell types and so forth,\nbut I promised to make it all very clear,\nregardless of your background.\nWe are also going to\ndiscuss a lot of tools.\nAnd I think many of you are\nprobably here because you want\nto know what you can do in order to boost\nor enhance the function\nof your immune system.\nThat's a very reasonable question to ask.\nI want to begin by just\nacknowledging that if one were\nto put that question into the internet,\nyou would get back a lot of answers.\nAnd there is now a sort of\ngeneric form of that answer\nthat deserves our respect,\nbut is not going to be the\ntopic of conversation today.\nI just want to tip my hat to it, however,\nand list off a few of\nthe things that we know\nset us up to be healthier than we would be\nif we didn't do these things.\nSo the first of course is\nthe foundation of all mental\nand physical health, which\nis to get adequate sleep.\nMeaning enough sleep,\nwhatever it is for you\nthat you require,\nto get deep sleep, so it's\ngot to be of high quality,\nand to time that sleep correctly.\nMeaning you can't sleep\nduring the day one day,\nand at night the next day,\nand expect your system to function well.\nI've talked a lot about\nthat before on this podcast.\nYou need a relatively\nconsistent sleep schedule\nmost of the time, about 80% of the time,\nor even better would be 90% of the time.\nBut the realities of life\nmake it that we can't always\ngo to bed at the same time\nand wake up at the exact same time.\nOkay, so we need sleep.\nWe do need sunshine.\nWhy do we need sunshine?\nBecause it sets our rhythm\ninto a regular state\nwhere the genes in all of our cells\ncan be expressed at the correct times.\nWe're sort of a factory\nof cells, if you will,\nand that factory can only\nrun properly if it knows\nwhen certain things should be active\nand when certain cells\nshould not be active.\nAnd the best way to coordinate\nall of those activities\nof all the cells is to\nget sunshine in your eyes\nin the morning and again in the evening,\nand not to get too much\nbright light in your eyes\nin the middle of the night.\nThat's just foundational.\nAnd then any lists that you'll find\non any number of websites\non the internet would say,\n\"Okay, get good sleep,\nget sun, get exercise.\"\nHow much exercise?\nWe should all be getting\n150 to 180 minutes\nof zone two cardio.\nThat's cardiovascular\nexercise where we can\njust barely hold a conversation\nor maybe not, per week.\nWe should be eating well.\nWe're always told we have\nto get good nutrition.\nWhat good nutrition means to\nyou is going to be different\nthan what it means to somebody else.\nBut we acknowledge that food intake\nand quality of food in particular,\navoiding processed foods,\nthat's going to be important.\nSocial connection is important.\nHydration is important.\nYou're starting to get the picture.\nWe can take all that,\nacknowledge it as useful\nand foundational for\nmental and physical health.\nBut of course there are many\npeople who still struggle\nwith getting ill too often,\nor with not being able to heal\nfrom physical injuries and wounds,\nor from various bacterial\nand viral infections\nquickly enough or deal\nwith chronic disease.\nAnd so, today's really about how you can\ntake all of that information,\nacknowledge it, and follow it.\nBut in addition to that,\nthere are things that\nyou can do to leverage\nyour nervous system in order\nto enhance the function\nof your immune system in very robust ways.\nSo that's where I'd like to\nshift the conversation to.\nThe first topic we have to\nattack is the question of\nwhat is the immune system\nand how does it work?\nI think many of you have heard\nof antibodies or killer cells\nor the various organs of\nthe body that are involved\nin the immune system,\nlike the bone marrow,\nthe spleen, the thymus,\nand the lymph nodes.\nI'd like to just take a\nmoment and do a sort of\nbrief immune system 101; really simple,\ncover the basic elements\nof the immune system\nso that everyone\nlistening or watching this\ncan get a clear sense of how\nthe immune system functions\nand what its basic parts are.\nFor some of you, this might be too basic.\nIt might be a little bit of background\nthat you already know.\nI think for most of you,\nthis information will be new.\nAnd I promise you, you\ndon't need a biology\nor medicine background in\norder to understand this.\nIt's actually really simple\nbecause it is truly elegant in design.\nYou have three main layers\nof defense for your health.\nThese are the three things\nthat are constantly at work\nto protect you from invasion\nand illness from bacteria,\nfrom viruses, and from parasites.\nAnd the first of those\nthree is a physical barrier\nthat we call your skin.\nAnd that might seem kind of obvious,\nbut everything about you is\ncontained in this compartment\nthat is boundaried by your skin.\nAnd your skin is a very important aspect\nof your immune system.\nIf you've ever had a cut,\nyou essentially have a\nbreach of the boundary\nthat is your immune system,\nand you would notice a number\nof things would happen.\nYou might get some\nswelling around that cut.\nYou might get a scab, likely\nyou would get a scab over time.\nIf it got dirty, there were\nsome bacteria that got in there,\nyou might see some accumulation\nof white blood cells,\nwhat's called puss.\nI know it's kind of gross,\nbut that's what that is.\nIt might take on a yellow tint\nbecause of the accumulation\nof some dead cells there.\nBut basically your skin\nis the primary barrier\nthrough which you keep\nthings from the outside\nthat could harm you from\ngetting to the inside.\nNow, still in category one,\nyour body and your external surface,\nyou have openings to that surface, right?\nYou're not just a round or a body shaped\ncompletely covered up with skin.\nYou have openings, what\nare those openings?\nWell, let's start at the\ntop and work our way down.\nA primary site of potential\ninfection are your eyes.\nYou have your ears,\nyou have your nostrils,\nyou have your mouth.\nOkay, those are going\nto be the primary sites\nby which things can get into your system.\nAnd you need to put\nthings into your system;\nyou need to drink and eat,\nand you need to get\nlight into your system.\nThat's why you have those openings,\nbut bad things, meaning\nthings that can harm you,\ncan get into those systems.\nAnd then of course, along\nthe back of your throat,\nall the way down to your stomach\nand your digestive system,\nand through your intestines\nand out your rectum,\nyou have a tube, that you are\nbasically a series of tubes.\nI've said that before on this podcast,\nand this is one such tube by\nwhich you extract nutrients\nfrom the outside environment.\nBut all along that tube,\nincluding your nose and your\nmouth, it's lined with mucus.\nAnd while mucus might seem\nkind of gross to some of you,\nthe more you learn about mucus,\nthe more you realize that\nmucus is really, really cool\nbecause mucus essentially\nacts as a filter,\nas a trap for bacteria and viruses.\nAnd it has certain ways of scrubbing\nor killing those bacteria and viruses.\nNow, the mucus is constantly\nbeing turned over,\nas we'll talk about later,\nthe chemistry of that\nmucus is really important\nin order to make sure that certain things\ndon't make it into your system,\nand other things are allowed\nto move through your system\nand you can extract nutrients from them.\nSo the reason I'm talking\nabout this first category\nof barrier for immune\nsystem in such detail\nis I'd like you to envision\nyourself as a human, of course,\nbut as a human that is a clear\nentity from everything else.\nAnd you have to bring in the right things\nand you have to keep out the\nwrong things or kill them.\nNow, inevitably, bacteria, viruses,\nand parasitic infections\nare going to make their way\ninto our body, but whether\nor not they are killed off\nor whether or not they\ntake over and cause us harm\nis going to be determined\nby layers two and three.\nSo, layers two and three are the so-called\ninnate immune system and\nthe adaptive immune system.\nSo the innate immune\nsystem is what I would call\nthe second layer of defense.\nIt's very fast.\nSo whether or not it's\nbacteria, virus, or parasite,\nwhat happens when you have\nsomething enter your body,\nmaybe you swallowed it, maybe\ngot in through your eyes,\nmaybe you shook somebody's\nhand who is carrying\na particular kind of illness,\nand then you wiped your eyes.\nAnd I've talked about\non this podcast before,\nvery soon after we meet another person,\nusually within 30 seconds,\nbelieve it or not,\nmost people wipe that person's chemicals\nsomewhere on their face or\non their body's surface.\nThis has been demonstrated\nover and over again.\nIf you want to learn more about that,\nwe did an episode all\nabout chemical signaling,\nwhere you can learn about it.\nI know it sounds weird and you\nmight say, \"I don't do that,\"\nbut indeed you do, most of\nthe time most everybody does.\nOkay, so, this innate immune\nsystem is this rapid response\nwhen something enters our system\nand our body doesn't recognize it.\nIt's not food, it's not clean air,\nit's something that's either\na bacteria, virus or parasite.\nAnd the innate immune\nsystem involves the release\nof particular cells that\nare waiting dormant,\nready to attack whatever this invader is.\nAnd some of these cell types\nyou've heard of before.\nThe most typical one are the\nso-called white blood cells.\nSo, the white blood cells\nwill actively go to the site\nof invasion and will start to encapsulate\nor try and surround that given invader.\nThe other names of these\ndifferent cell types\nare things like neutrophils, macrophages,\nnatural killer cells are just a few\nof the many types of immune cells.\nSo there's kind of like\nan ambulance system,\nbut rather than go and\ntry and heal something\nlike a paramedic would,\nthey go there and they try\nand surround and kill\nwhatever this invader is.\nThey work in concert with\ntwo other assistants,\nand those assistants are\ncalled the compliment proteins.\nCompliment proteins exist in the blood,\nand what they do is they travel to sites\nwhere there's an invasion\nand they mark certain things\nfor being engulfed and eaten.\nSo they sort of put an \"eat me\" tag on it.\nThey basically put a\nchemical tag onto invaders\nthat then allows those white\nblood cells, neutrophils,\nmacrophages, natural killer cells to say,\n\"Ah, I need to basically kill this thing,\nand then wrap it in a\nbody bag and send it off.\nKill that thing, wrap in a\nbody bag and send it off.\"\nAnd I'm using the analogy of the body bag,\nbut in the sense it's the right one rather\nbecause these cells that\ncome in and kill things,\nthe way they do that is actually to engulf\nthe invading bacteria, virus or parasite.\nSo they actually surround it.\nAnd when you see puss or you see infection\nin maybe a cut on the skin\nor something like that,\nor even in an ingrown hair\nthat gets some bacteria in it,\nthat puss and the white part,\nI know it's kind of gross to talk about,\nbut those are the white blood cells,\noftentimes it's dead cells,\nand that's the dead invader sitting there.\nSo it's trying to create\nan isolated compartment\n'cause it wants to keep it\nin that part of the body.\nOkay, so you've got the\ninnate immune system,\nthe compliment comes\nthrough blood and helps it\nby tagging certain things\nwith an \"eat me\" signal.\nAnd then there are the cells\nthat are either damaged\nfrom the injury or from the parasite,\nor are suffering because of the bacteria\nor the virus itself, and\nthe cells of your body\nwill also release an alarm signal,\nwhich is not an \"eat me\"\nsignal, but a \"help me\" signal.\nAnd those \"help me\"\nsignals come in the form\nof what we call cytokines.\nAnd the cytokines are\nthings like interleukin-1,\ninterleukin-6, tumor\nnecrosis factor alpha.\nYou may have heard of these\nthings if you are at all curious\nabout or have been learning\nabout the health space,\nonline health space, especially\nin the last few years,\ninflammation is all the buzz word now.\nEveryone's talking about inflammation,\ninflammation, inflammation.\nWhat do we mean when we say inflammation?\nWell, inflammation is a physical response,\nbut it's also a chemical response.\nAnd many times the markers of\ninflammation that are measured\nin people or in animal models\nwhere this research is done,\nare things like\ninterleukin-1, interleukin-6,\ntumor necrosis factor alpha.\nSo when those go up in the blood,\nit's a sign that somewhere there's a cell\nthat's saying \"help me, help me.\"\nAnd is secreting these\nthings which calls in\nthose neutrophils, macrophages,\nnatural killer cells,\nand white blood cells, okay?\nAnd it might help to remember all this,\nby just telling people\nthat what interleukin means\nis to communicate, right?\nSo the interleukin is\nshouting out \"help me,\"\nthe compliment proteins\nare coming in and saying,\n\"eat this\" and tagging the\ninvader with an \"eat me\" signal.\nAnd then the killer cells\nand the white blood cells\nare doing the job of trying\nto kill off that thing.\nThat's the innate immune system.\nSo, your skin and your mucus lining\nplus your innate immune system\nare a beautiful two-layered\nset of defenses against various kinds\nof invaders and infections.\nAnd then there's the third type,\nwhich is the adaptive immune system.\nAnd you'll notice that\nleading up until now,\nI haven't said the word antibody at all,\nand that's because it is\nthe job not of the skin\nor the mucus or the microbiome\nor the innate immune system\nto produce antibodies that can\nrecognize specific invaders,\nbut rather it is the job of\nthe adaptive immune system\nto create antibodies\nagainst bacteria, viruses,\nand even parasites and\neven physical intruders\nto your system.\nSo, the adaptive immune system\nhas this incredible ability\nto show up at the site of invasion\nor infection or inflammation.\nIt's called there by various cues,\nincluding the cytokines that\nwe talked about earlier.\nAnd what it does is it\nactually attaches to\nand creates a sort of\nan imprint of the shape\nof whatever invader happens to be there.\nSo if that particular\ninvading bacteria or virus\nhas a contour that's kind\nof rippled or kind of spiky\nor whatever shape it happens to have,\nit creates an imprint of that.\nAnd then, using that imprint in concert\nwith some other cells, creates\nantibodies that are specific\nto recognize that invader should the body\never have that invader inside of it again.\nNow, that's why it's called\nthe adaptive immune system.\nAnd in many ways it creates\na memory of a prior infection\nso that these antibodies\ncan be made anytime\nthat same invader comes\nback again, all right?\nAnd so, this is the basis\nof what we call immunity.\nThis is the basis of what\nwe call an enhanced ability\nto combat certain types of infections.\nAnd it's really a wonderful, and I mean,\nI can't even state how\nincredible this really is,\nthat all of our bodies\nhave this capacity, right?\nWe have something called leukocytes.\nThese are essentially white blood cells.\nWe have red blood cells\nand white blood cells,\nand they both are derived from\nthe same type of origin cell.\nIt's a stem cell.\nWhen you hear stem cell,\na stem cell just means\na cell that can become many\ndifferent types of other cells.\nWe sometimes hear about stem\ncells in terms of people\nthat are getting injections of stem cells\nor the potential therapeutic effects\nor potential of stem cells.\nBut we all harbor certain\nstem cells within us as well,\nthat can become lots of\ndifferent cell types.\nAnd there's one particular\ntype of stem cell,\nwhich is the hematopoietic stem cell,\nwhich can give rise to red blood cells\nand white blood cells.\nAnd in general, these\nreside in the marrow,\nat least in adults.\nSo, in our bone marrow,\nwe have this ability to make certain cells\nthat can go out when they\nare called out chemically,\nthey get called out to sites of infection\nand create antibodies,\nand then maintain those\nantibodies in our system,\nor have a memory of that\nparticular infection\nso that if the infection comes back again,\nwe can kill it off immediately.\nAnd it doesn't have to pass\nthrough these multiple stages\nof first, the innate response,\nthen the adaptive\nresponse, taking some time.\nNow, there are a lot more details\nto the adaptive immune system,\nbut I just want to emphasize a few points\nthat might be relevant.\nFirst of all, the name of the antibodies\nthat are created\nsometimes come in the form\nof IgM and IgG, things of that sort.\nThis isn't a full deep\ndive immunology class,\nbut Ig stands for immunoglobulin, okay?\nSo the immunoglobulins are a part of\nthe adaptive immune response\nin creating antibodies.\nIf you hear IgM, the IgM is the first\nof the adaptive immune responses,\nand it tends to come on earlier.\nSo if somebody is immunopositive for IgM\nfor a particular type of\nviral or bacterial invader,\nthat means that it was a\nfairly recent infection.\nLater, one creates...\nThe adaptive immune system,\nI should say, creates an IgG,\nwhich is the more stable\nform of the specific antibody\nthat's going to recognize a given invader.\nSo IgG tends to come\nup a little bit later.\nSo, just to recap,\nsomething gets into your\nsystem through your eyes,\nthrough some hole in your skin,\na cut, through your mouth,\nsexually transmitted\ndiseases come in through\nthe mucus membranes that\nare on the genitalia\nor in the genitalia,\nsexually transmitted\ndisease, airborne disease,\ngets into the mucus, somehow\ngets into the bloodstream.\nThen there's the innate response,\nwhich is a more general\nresponse of trying to contain\nand combat the infection or invader.\nAnd then the adaptive response is the one\nthat generates the antibodies.\nFirst, the IgM response, the\nimmunoglobulin-M response,\nand then the immunoglobulin-G\nresponse, IgG response.\nSo, how do we keep these three barriers\nor these three defense\nsystems to infection tuned up?\nWell, leaving aside the list of things\nthat I mentioned before that generally\nenhances their function,\nthings like sleep and\nsunlight and good nutrition,\net cetera, the sort of generic\nthings for good health,\none of the key ways we\ncan do that is to keep\nthat mucus lining in really good shape.\nAnd what does that mean?\nWell, the mucus lining needs\nto turn over quite often\nand it needs to be the\ncorrect chemistry to be a trap\nfor the bad stuff and\nfor it to be permeable\nto the good stuff, to the\nnutrients that we need.\nAnd it is now very clear from hundreds,\nif not thousands of studies\nthat the best way to do that\nis to maintain a healthy\nso-called microbiome.\nThe microbiome being these\nlittle bacterial organisms\nthat are good for us that live\nall along our mucus pathways\nand even in our eyes.\nNow, just to be really clear,\nit's not just about the gut microbiome;\nwe actually have a microbiome in our eyes,\nwe have one that's specific to our mouth,\nwe have a nasal specific microbiome,\nthere's one all along the gut\nand the species of microbiota\nthat live all along the digestive tract\ndiffer from the mouth, to\nthe throat, to the stomach,\nintestines, into the rectum.\nIt's well-established that\nthere are healthy microbiota\nthat live all along that length,\nand that they differ along that length.\nThere's also a urethral microbiota,\nand there's a vaginal\nmicrobiota that promotes health\nof that environment as well.\nSo how is it that one can\nmaintain the healthy microbiota\nand not favor growth of harmful bacteria,\nor allow that mucus lining\nto become too permeable\nto the bad stuff that can\ncome in from the environment?\nWell, as far as we know,\nthere are three main ways to do that.\nThe first two are purely\nstructural and mechanical.\nIt's very clear now from work,\nsome of which was done at\nStanford, but elsewhere as well,\nthat the nasal microbiome\nis particularly good\nat scrubbing bacteria,\nat preventing certain types of infections.\nSo, this is a reminder\nthat whenever possible,\nunless eating or speaking, you\nwant to be nasal breathing,\nnot breathing through your mouth.\nYour nose is a much\nbetter filter for viruses\nand bacteria than is your mouth.\nThe mouth contains certain\nstructural features,\neven organs and cell\ntypes that can protect\nagainst incoming infection,\nbut you don't want to be a mouth breather\nfor a variety of reasons.\nAnd there's a terrific book called\n\"Jaws: A Hidden Epidemic,\"\nwhich was written by my colleagues,\nSandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich at Stanford,\nand Stanford Medicine with a foreword\nby Jared Diamond and Robert Sapolsky.\nSo it's really a lot of\nheavy hitters on that book\nthat talks about the increase in infection\nthat one gets when\nbreathing through the mouth,\nas opposed to the nose.\nNow, of course, during hard exercise,\none breathes through the mouth,\nthat's not necessarily bad.\nWhen one is eating or speaking,\nthat's not necessarily bad at all.\nI guess it depends on what you're saying.\nThat was a joke.\nBut in general, when possible you want\nto be breathing through your nose.\nMany people have trouble\nbreathing through their nose\nbecause of so-called deviated septums\nor chronically collapsed sinuses.\nThe best way to dilate\nthose sinuses is actually\nto breathe through your nose.\nSo it can take a little bit of time,\nbut there is some\nplasticity to the sinuses.\nAnd so, be a nose breather,\nnot a mouth breather,\nyou will combat more of the infections\nthat you are constantly confronted with.\nI should mention that\nwe are always bombarded\nwith different types of bacteria, viruses,\nand parasites in our environment.\nAnd the goal of course,\nis to reinforce your immune system,\nso you can keep these things\nat bay and not get sick.\nThere's actually a\npaper that was published\nin Cell Reports, \"Cell Press Journal,\"\nexcellent journal that showed\nthat the nasal microbiome,\nit has particular species of microbiota\nthat are good at fighting off infection.\nThere has not been a direct\nlink between particular patterns\nof nasal breathing and\nthe nasal microbiome yet,\nbut oxygenation of that environment\nby breathing through your nose,\nturns out to be quite important overall\nfor enhancing it as a filter.\nSo don't just think of\nyour nose as something\nto smell foods and to bring in air.\nIt's also an active filter for\nthings that could invade you.\nThe other way to try\nand keep out bad things\nand to avoid getting sick is\nthe advice that your mother,\nand certainly my mother gave me,\nwhich is to not touch your eyes\nafter touching other people\nor touching other surfaces.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nwe tend to do this subconsciously.\nBut the reason to avoid\ndoing that is the eyes\nare a primary entry point for\na lot of bacteria and viruses.\nYou're constantly lubricating\nthe surface of your eyes\nwith the so-called lacrimal glands,\nand tears and things of that sort.\nIf you've ever noticed when\nyou wake up in the morning,\nyou have some sleep in your eyes,\nyou know the kind of crusty stuff\nin the corners of your\neyes or on your eyelashes,\nthat sleep, that crust\nare actually dead bacteria\nthat you've successfully\nbattled during the night.\nOkay, that's what that is.\nIt's not the accumulation\nof some healthy tissue.\nIt's the accumulation of that\nyour healthy mucus membranes\nand tears and other things\nthat are specifically\ncombating those bacteria.\nSo, I know that sounds a little bit gross,\nbut that's what that is.\nSo you're wiping away the\ncasualties of a battle\nthat you fought at night.\nSo during the daytime, you\ndon't want to introduce viruses\nand things to your eyes\nas much as possible.\nIt is a primary site of entry.\nThis is why people wear\ngoggles in surgical units\nand things of that sort,\nto try and avoid getting\nthings into their eyes.\nVery, very important.\nAnd then the third way to\nkeep a healthy line of defense\nfor your entire mucus tract is to enhance\nthe proliferation of good gut microbiota.\nThe best way to enhance the\nquality of your gut microbiome\nand the mucus lining that\nserves as this protective layer\nall along your body is to ingest\ntwo to four servings a day\nof fermented foods, low\nsugar fermented foods.\nI've talked about this\nbefore a bunch of times\non the podcast, but these\nare data from my colleague,\nJustin Sonnenburg's lab at Stanford Med.\nAnd there, I just wiped my eyes.\nYep, you got me.\nBut a paper published\nin the journal \"Cell,\"\nwhich is a absolutely spectacular journal,\nreally points to the fact that when\npeople eat fermented foods,\ntwo to four servings per day,\nit helps reduce the activity\nof certain cytokines.\nNow, you know what those are, right?\nCells make cytokines to call\nout, \"help me, help me.\"\nTo reduce the amount of cytokines,\nthe so-called inflammatom.\nNow that doesn't render\nthose cells more vulnerable.\nThe reason they saw a\nreduction in IL-6 and IL-1,\nand some of these other cytokines\nis because when people have\na healthy gut microbiome,\nthere are fewer cells in\nthe body being infected\nfrom outside infections and\ntherefore less of a reason\nfor cells to be crying out, \"help,\"\nbecause they are thriving, not suffering.\nSo, don't wipe your eyes,\nkeep your hands clean,\neveryone tells you that, right?\nBut keep your hands clean,\ndon't wipe your eyes,\nbe a nasal breather, not a mouth breather,\nunless you're speaking,\nexercising or eating,\nand keep a healthy gut microbiome\nby eating two to four servings\na day of quality, low sugar,\nfermented foods, things like sauerkraut,\nthings like natto if you can access that.\nI've tried it before, it's interesting.\nIt's sort of an acquired\ntaste, kimchi, pickles,\nagain, low sugar sources\nare going to be the sources\nthat are going to be\nmost effective for this.\nSo now you're armed with three\nways to enhance the function\nof your immune system and\ncombat infection that is,\nI like to think separate from the typical\ntype of information that you\nget such as get good sleep,\ngood nutrition, good social\nconnection, et cetera.\nAll of that stuff still holds true,\nbut these three other points\nI think can really make\na substantial difference\nin terms of bolstering\nthe immune system, your immune system.\nI do want to mention,\nbecause these names are going\nto come up several times\nduring this episode,\nthat while interleukins like IL-6 and IL-1\nencourage inflammation, they\nare these \"help me\" signals\nthat call in cells to gobble up invaders.\nThere are some interleukins\nthat are anti-inflammatory.\nAnd the one that I'd like\nto highlight in particular,\nbecause it will come up\nagain in a little bit\nis interleukin-10.\nSo not all of the IL, insert number,\nnot all of the interleukins\nare inflammatory,\nsome are anti-inflammatory.\nSo that's an important\npoint to keep in mind\nas we go forward.\nNext, I'd like to talk about\nwhat's called sickness behavior.\nAnd indeed there is a category of behavior\nthat we call sickness behavior\nthat is very informative\nas to the things that we can\ndo to avoid getting sick.\nNow, this notion of sickness behavior\ngoes back several decades or more.\nAnd it's a very interesting way of looking\nat the function of the immune system,\nbecause what it does is it\nbridges us from this thing\nthat we're calling the immune\nsystem where it's T-cells,\nand B-cells, and cytokines and leukocytes,\nand it starts taking us into the realm\nof the nervous system,\nbecause of course the nervous\nsystem controls behavior.\nSo sickness behavior\nis a suite of responses\nthat we tend to all undergo\nwhen we are feeling sick.\nSo this is going to vary\nfrom person to person,\nbut there's some general\ncategories of things\nthat we all do and that\nhappen to all of us\nafter we are wounded or sick\nor dealing with an infection of any kind.\nAnd by examining sickness\nbehavior in some detail,\nit can be really informative as to routes\nthat we can take to health.\nSo the main thing about sickness behavior\nis that it tends to involve a slowing\nof our usual levels of activity.\nPeople start to feel lethargic,\nor they feel like the\nactivities that previously\nthey could do with relative ease\nare very difficult for them\nor somewhat overwhelming.\nThe other thing you start to\nsee is that people and animals,\nby the way, stop grooming,\nthey stop taking care of themselves.\nNot necessarily stopped showering,\nalthough oftentimes that's the case,\nbut they will stop doing their hair,\nthey'll stop putting on makeup,\ndepending on whether or\nnot they did that before,\nthey might stop.\nAnimals will stop licking\nand grooming themselves.\nPeople will stop taking care\nof their cosmetic appearance.\nNow it's not just because they don't care\nhow they look when they're sick,\nit's because there's\nthis overall suppression\nof certain kinds of\nactivities and an enhancement\nof other kinds of activities.\nAnd this is really important.\nSickness behavior is\nactually a motivated state.\nIt's a state that's designed\nto accomplish certain things.\nOne of the other features\nof sickness behavior\nin addition to being\nlethargic, loss of grooming,\nwill be a loss of appetite, right?\nOftentimes people who have\na great appetite normally\njust won't feel hungry at all.\nAnd there are several theories\nas to why this would be.\nOne prominent idea in\nthe literature is that\nit's to discourage vomiting and diarrhea,\nwhich of course can be\ninfectious to other people.\nSo, that's a theory.\nI don't know that that's\never been tested directly,\nbut that's one idea.\nThe other idea is that it's\nsimply to harbor more resources\nfor sake of repair.\nAnd I want to talk about\nthat because we are all told\nto get extra sleep when we\naren't feeling well or to rest.\nBut just like any good\ntwo or three-year-old\nconstantly asks, \"why, why?\"\nGood scientists, good\npeople who are interested\nin health information\nshould always be asking why.\nWhy should I get more sleep?\nWhat happens in sleep that I should\nget more sleep when I'm sick?\nWhy shouldn't I just push through this?\nAnd there are a couple of reasons for this\nthat have been established\nin the literature.\nThe first is that there does\nseem to be something useful\nabout slowing circulation when we are ill.\nOne idea that has some data to support it\nis that when we slow our\ncirculation, our blood circulation,\nso not running around so\nmuch or running it all,\nbut rather lying down, getting\nextra rest, maybe sleeping,\nmaybe even just remaining still,\nis that the lymphatic system,\nwhich carries a lot of the\nimmune-related cells and fluids,\nis able to ramp up its levels of activity.\nSo, this is interesting, right?\nSo reducing circulation of the blood,\nbut increasing circulation\nof the lymphatic system.\nYou've all probably been familiar\nwith the lymphatic system\nwhen you're combating an infection,\nyour lymph nodes can get sore.\nYou've got lymph nodes behind your ears,\nin your groin, your\narmpits, around your throat,\naround near your thyroid,\nin your throat, et cetera.\nSo, that's the other reason.\nNow, some people, when they get sick,\npsychologically go into\na very vulnerable state\nwhere they really, really want people,\nother people to take care of them.\nYou've probably witnessed this,\nor you feel this way yourself.\nAbout 50% of people have that response.\nThey really want to be taken care of.\nNow, when you think about it\nfrom an adaptive perspective,\nthis makes sense, right?\nA member of our species is\nill and they more or less\nwill cry out for help\nin one form or another\nto the other members of their\nspecies to take care of them.\nAnd of course this will be\nespecially apparent in cases\nwhere people are young enough\nor incapacitated enough\nthat they can't actually\nget resources on their own.\nIf you've ever been really sick,\njust getting up and going to\nthe fridge or to the restroom\ncan feel like a monumental task.\nSo about 50% of people report\nor describe seeking of help\nand support when they are sick.\nBut you could also\nimagine how this would be\na very non-adaptive response\nbecause it increases the\nopportunity to spread infection\nto the caretaker.\nSo that's an interesting consideration.\nAnother 50% of people seem\nto have the opposite response\nwhen they're sick.\nSo, somehow, regardless of how they were\nprior to getting ill,\nthe sickness behavior that's engaged\nby these neural circuits in the brain,\nthey are indeed neural\ncircuits in the brain,\ncreate a stay away from me.\nI don't want to be bothered.\nI want to be left alone.\nI don't want to be taken care of, right?\nIt's not stubbornness.\nIt's literally a lack of interest\nor a disinterest in social\nconnection when one is sick.\nAnd you see this in animals too,\nsome animals will seek out\nother members of their species.\nOthers, like my unfortunately now\npassed away bulldog, Costello.\nWhen he was sick I always knew\nbecause he would go around\nthe back of the house and\nhe would just hide there.\nHe would just take himself\naway from everybody else.\nHe did not want to be taken care of.\nAnd it was just a natural response to him.\nI don't think he was trying to prevent me\nfrom getting whatever it was that he had.\nSo if ever somebody doesn't\nwant to be taken care of,\nor if they do want to be taken care of,\nrealize that people tend to fall into\nthese two bins naturally,\nand animals tend to fall into these bins.\nRegardless of what species\nthey are, it's about 50/50.\nAnd again, this sickness\nbehavior is a motivated state.\nIt's designed to slow\ncirculation of the blood,\nincrease circulation of the lymph,\nand the other killer cells in the body,\nreduce the probability of\ninfecting others by reducing,\nits thought, diarrhea and vomit,\nbut also breathing on others,\ninteracting with others.\nAnd in some cases it will activate this,\nI don't want to call it a regressed state,\nbut many people feel somewhat more...\nIf they are adults,\nthey feel more childlike\nwhen they are ill and they want\nto be taken care of very badly.\nSome of it might be learned.\nSome of it might be innate.\nWe don't know, but the sickness\nbehavior is very interesting\nfor a couple of reasons.\nFirst of all, it mimics another state\nthat has been described in\nthe neuroscience literature,\nwhich is major depression.\nAnd in both sick individuals,\nsick from bacterial or viral infection,\nand in people with major depression,\nit's been shown that\nthere are robust increases\nin the levels of interleukin-6\nand tumor necrosis factor alpha.\nSo there is an idea now circulating\nthat depression involves\nthese inflammatory\ncytokines being very active.\nAnd we know that illness involves\ninflammatory cytokines being very active.\nSo if you think about it,\nthe similarity between major\ndepression and being sick\nought to be able to point us\nin a direction of interventions\nthat could help us either prevent illness\nor move through illness more quickly.\nBut as we head in that direction,\nbecause indeed that's the case,\nI just want to emphasize\nthat sickness behavior\nis what provides this bridge\nbetween the immune system\nand the nervous system.\nAnd what we'll soon see also\nis that healthy behavior,\nbehavior that allows\nus to avoid infection,\nalso points to a clear bridge between\nthe nervous system and the immune system.\nThat it isn't just that we have a brain\nand body and our organs, and\nthen we have an immune system.\nThat's true, but they're\ninteracting all the time.\nAnd this is going to lead us to a place\nwhere it's going to be very\nclear and not at all surprising\nhow certain patterns of\nthinking and certain behaviors\nthat we can elect to take can help enhance\nour immune system function and vice versa.\nThere are two other features\nof sickness behavior\ndefinitely worth pointing out.\nOne is a theory, which is\nthat the reduced appetite,\nin particular appetite for\nprotein rich foods when sick,\nis thought to be an attempt,\na subconscious attempt,\nof the organism to\nreduce the amount of iron\nthat it's taking in.\nNow, typically the amount of iron intake\nthat's recommended or\nmore or less is for men,\nit's about eight milligrams per day.\nFor women, it's anywhere from\n18 to 27 milligrams per day,\ndepending on whether or\nnot they're pregnant,\nlactating or menstruating, et\ncetera, the ranges can vary.\nBut, and indeed, it's\ntrue that if iron levels\nin the blood go too high, like\nover 45 milligrams per day\ncan be very toxic to the system.\nBut the theory that's prominent\nin the biology literature\nand in the health literature\nis that the reduction\nin appetite is actually an attempt\nto reduce iron intake specifically\nbecause many bacteria and\nother forms of infection\nseem to thrive when levels of\niron in the blood are high.\nAnd I don't want to see\nanyone take this too extreme\nand suddenly do an iron deprivation diet\nin order to get well.\nBut it's an interesting\ntheory that I'd be remiss\nif I didn't mention,\nbecause it makes good sense.\nIron is actually attached to hemoglobin\nand red blood cells in the bloodstream.\nNormally that can help us quite a lot.\nIt's also in muscle,\nI should mention that.\nIron can be a sequestered into muscle,\nand iron serves a lot of\nimportant health promoting roles,\nbut by reducing appetite and\nthereby reducing iron intake,\nit does reduce the\ncapacity of certain things,\nincluding infections to\ntravel in certain compartments\nwithin the body.\nSo, again, that's just theory,\nbut I think many of you\nare probably familiar\nwith not having an\nappetite when you're sick.\nThe other thing that's\nvery typical of people\nwith major depression is loss of appetite,\nnot always but often loss of appetite.\nSo, here again, we have loss of appetite\nin sickness behavior, loss of\nappetite and major depression,\nand perhaps not surprisingly\none of the major symptoms\nof sickness behavior and major depression\nthat map more or less onto one another\nis loss of libido or interest,\nnot just in social interactions,\nbut in sex and reproduction.\nAnd so, again, if you think\nabout sickness behavior\nand depression, they\nare very, very similar.\nOkay, so sickness behavior\nand major depression\nhave certain core features in common.\nWe need to therefore ask\nourselves why and how does\nbeing sick influence the way\nthat we think and perceive\nour environment and impact our appetite,\nwhether or not we want\nto be cared for more\nor cared for less?\nAgain, people tend to diverge\ninto two different bins there,\nand believe it or not,\nthe pathway for this has been identified.\nWhen we have an infection\nsomeplace in our body,\nand it could be up in our head,\nit could be a sinus infection,\nit could be an ear infection,\nor I should also mention\nmany of these same mechanisms\ncan also be the consequence of a wound\nor an injury to the body.\nA back injury or a slipped disc\nor I guess it's called a herniated disc\nis the way that you hear it described.\nWhen we have that, we\ncan be kind of irritable,\nwe don't want to do certain things\nand we just want to be left alone.\nThings are harder.\nHow? Why?\nWell, there's a known pathway,\nwhich is the so-called vagus nerve\nthat connects the body and the brain,\nsignals to particular brain\nsites to engage this category\nof motivational state that\nwe call sickness behavior.\nMany of you have probably\nheard of the vagus,\nV-A-G-U-S, vagus.\nThe vagus nerve is a very\nextensive nerve pathway,\nas the 10th cranial nerve\ncomes out of the back\nof the brainstem, heads into the body,\nand branches out extensively to innervate\nor connect to many of our organs,\nincluding our lungs, our\nheart, our gut, et cetera.\nAnd all of those organs are\nable also to send neural signals\nback up to the brain.\nWe sometimes hear of\nthe vagus as the route\nto calming ourselves down.\nUnfortunately, that's more or less a myth\nthat I don't know how it got propagated.\nYou have lots of different\npathways in the vagus\nUsually vagal stimulation\nactually creates more arousal\nand alertness, although it\ndoes have multiple pathways,\nbut there have now been\nmany studies of the vagus\nin various contexts, including\nin sickness behavior.\nAnd it's very clear that the\nvagus nerve is the fast pathway\nby which an infection in the\nbody is signaled to the brain,\nto a particular location in the brain\ncalled the hypothalamus,\nwhich harbors a lot of\ndifferent types of neurons.\nNeurons, for instance,\nin the preoptic area\nthat increase body\ntemperature and fever, right?\nThat's one of the most important things\nis to increase body temperature,\nit's the body's attempt\nto kill off this invader\nbecause many viruses and many bacteria\ndon't survive well at elevated heat.\nThat's the function of a fever.\nA fever actually has a functional role.\nSo, in biology, we like complicated words,\nso we call anything that\nincreases body temperature\nor creates a fever, a pyrogen.\nMany years ago, in my undergraduate years,\nI was working on pyrogens,\ninjecting something\ncalled lipopolysaccharide\ninto the belly, which\nthen gives you a fever.\nThe way it does that is LPS causes\nan inflammation response in the gut.\nThe gut doesn't know what is happening.\nThe stomach cells don't\nknow what's happening.\nSo they just start secreting\nthe IL-6, the IL-1,\nall those cytokines, the killer\ncells migrate into the gut.\nThat's why you sometimes\nget a stomach ache\nwhen you don't feel well, you have a flu,\nor something like it.\nA neural signal, electrical\nsignals get sent up\nto the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus says, oh,\nI don't know what's going on\nout there, but there's a\nsignal something's going on.\nLet's just heat up the body.\nLet's just start cooking\nwhatever it is out there.\nAnd of course you don't\nwant fever to go too high\nbecause you can kill brain cells.\nBut within a particular range\nthe fever is a functional\nand adaptive response, okay?\nSo if you're taking drugs\nto try and lower the fever\nthat might make you feel more comfortable,\nbut actually that's limiting\nthe response that your body\nis creating in order to try\nand kill off that invader.\nAnd again, you don't want\nfever to go too high.\nThis is going to vary depending on age.\nYou can look up online what the tolerable\nranges are for fever.\nBut when you're trying\nto lower body temperature\nwhen you have a fever,\nunless you're heading into\ndangerous levels of heating up,\nthat's actually the wrong\nway to take your system\nif you do indeed want to\nkill off that invader.\nOkay, so the vagus nerve\nis the quick response.\nIt also sends input to areas of the brain\nthat change your perception\nof the outside world.\nOne of the most obvious of these,\nobvious once I tell it to\nyou, is photophobia, right?\nI love bright sunshine.\nI love bright lights\nwhen I want to be alert.\nWe all have different\nlevels of light sensitivity,\nbut most people when they are sick,\nwhen there's an inflammation\nresponse in the body,\nthey feel like bright\nlights are kind of aversive.\nThey get a well-described\nkind of classical photophobia,\nand that's mediated by a\npathway that goes from your eye\nto an area of your thalamus,\ncalled the anterior\nnucleus of the thalamus.\nThis is work that was\ndone by Clifford Saper\nat Harvard Medical School.\nIt's really beautiful work.\nAnd then from there up to the\nouter lining of the brain,\nwhich is the meninges just sort of\non the outside of the brain\nwhere the brain starts\nto interface with some of\nthe other connective tissues.\nWe'll talk more about these later.\nIt can actually create a\nphotophobia and a headache\nwhen one is ill.\nSo, here's the pathway:\nSome invader gets into your system\n'cause you wiped your eyes or\nit got in through your mouth.\nYou didn't listen to your mother\nand got in through your eyes.\nYou're feeling sick.\nSomething's going on there.\nYou have a stomach ache because of all\nthe inflammation there,\nthe signal goes up from your vagus nerve.\nYou're heating up with a fever.\nYou've got photophobia\nbecause you've activated\nthis pathway by which what would\nnormally be tolerable light\nis triggering this thalamic\nnucleus, the anterior thalamus,\nthat's projecting up to the meninges.\nYou got a headache in\nresponse to looking at light.\nIt's basically triggering\nan overall pathway\nto get you to go into a\nquiet, dark place and rest.\nAnd the last element I'd like\nto talk about is the rest.\nThere's something that gets\ntriggered from the body\nto the brain, to the hypothalamus,\nand we think we know which\nhypothalamic area it is.\nIt's the supraoptic nucleus, we think.\nSupraoptic 'cause it's right above\nyour so-called optic chiasm,\nIf you want to look up where that is,\nit's right above the roof of your mouth.\nAnd there are nuclei there that\npromote the desire to sleep\neven during the daytime,\nwhat would normally be\nthe active phase of your circadian cycle.\nNow, that is really interesting\nbecause what's happening\nhere is you've got multiple\npathways that are saying avoid light,\nreduce your amount of behavior, heat up,\nall the things that are making you sick.\nThis is sickness behavior,\nand it's going from your body\nto your mind to make\nyou do the right thing.\nNow there's also a slow pathway\nthat's purely mediated by the blood,\nso-called humoral factors.\nNot 'cause they're funny,\nbut humoral factors are\nfactors of the blood.\nAs you have an infection\nfor many hours or days,\nthe amount of IL-6 and IL-1\nand tumor necrosis factor and\nother inflammatory cytokines\nis starting to increase\nsuch that the total amount\nin your circulation gets high enough\nand is communicated to the brain.\nAnd it tends to enter the brain through\na particular type of tissue\nthat's really interesting\ncalled choroid, C-H-O-R-O-I-D.\nChoroid is really interesting.\nIt's kind of this fluffy tissue\nthat sits in your ventricles.\nThe ventricles are the\nspaces in your brain,\nand the spaces in your\nbrain have what's called\ncerebral spinal fluid in them.\nThe cerebral spinal fluid contains\na number of important things,\nbut the choroid starts\nreleasing and responding\nto these cytokines, the\ninflammatory cytokines,\nand then the brain actually\nstarts to experience\nall sorts of changes in terms\nof inflammation to neurons,\nyour memory tends to get poor,\nyour cognition tends to get poor.\nThese are transient things most often.\nEventually these things will pass,\nbut this is deep into sickness\nwhen you're really feeling lousy.\nYou can't read, you can't watch a movie,\nyou can't do anything.\nSo if you ever get sick and you just can't\nbe bothered by anything,\nit's probably because you've\nhad that fast response\nfrom the body and you've\nalso had the slower response\nwhere you literally have a\nset of tissues in your brain\nthat are sending out these\ninflammatory signals.\nAnd now your whole brain\nis starting to cope,\nor is trying to cope with this infection.\nSo you've got a slow\npathway and a fast pathway.\nThat all sounds really terrible.\nSo, now, I'd like to talk\nabout what you can do to reduce\nthe probability of getting sick.\nAnd there are actually\nthings that one can do\nas you start to get sick\nand once you're sick,\nto accelerate the healing\nprocess by flipping the equation.\nUp until now we've been\ntalking about how the body\nactivates certain areas\nin the brain to create\nsickness behavior that's\nvery much like depression.\nYou're probably all familiar\nwith this from anytime\nyou've had a cold or a flu\nor something really lousy\nor an injury.\nNow, let's flip the equation\nand ask what can we do\nwith our nervous system\nin order to enhance\nthe function of our immune\nsystem in order to be able\nto heal and recover from\nillness and injury more quickly.\nSo let's say you are in that\nunfortunate circumstance\nof waking up one day or coming home,\nand you've got that tickle in your throat,\nor when you breathe,\nyour nasal passages\ndon't feel the same way.\nYou've got a little bit of a headache.\nYou're feeling kind of off.\nWe all know what we should do.\nWe should all hydrate, drink\nsome water and go to sleep.\nRight, that's we are all told,\nbut there are actually things\nthat you can actively do\nin order to get your immune\nsystem to deploy a more robust\nresponse at that early phase\nof potential infection.\nLet's focus first on the rest component.\nYes, of course we are all\ntold that we should take\na hot shower and go to sleep,\nand get nine or 10 hours of sleep.\nBut there's an interesting\nway of looking at sleep,\nspecifically for its role in\nenhancing the immune system.\nAnd there's a wonderful review,\nI'll put the review in the\ncaptions that looked specifically\nat the literature surrounding\nsleep that is different\nbecause it occurs in support\nof the immune system.\nSo normally when we go to sleep,\nwe have slow-wave sleep predominantly\nin the early phase of the night,\nand then over time as we\nsleep longer and longer,\nwe get more so-called REM,\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nI talked all about this\non the episodes on sleep.\nOf course you have slow-wave\nsleep and REM sleep\nthroughout the night always,\nbut it's the fraction of slow-wave sleep\nto REM sleep that shifts,\nand they have different\nfunctions, et cetera.\nThere is some evidence\nthat the sleep associated\nwith an infection, in particular,\nearly stage of infection,\nis associated with elevated\nlevels of serotonin in the brain\nthat either through an adaptive mechanism\nor for whatever reason,\nthe neurons in the brain\nof the so-called raphe nucleus start\nreleasing more serotonin.\nAnd that serotonin and\nits related pathways\ncan help enhance some of\nthe immune system function\nthat could combat the infection.\nThere is starting to be some data,\nand I emphasize starting because it's not\na very robust literature yet,\nlooking at whether or not\nsupplementing precursors\nto serotonin like 5-HTP,\nwhich can be taken in a supplement form\nor consuming foods that\nincrease serotonin naturally.\nSo these would be any foods that contain\nhigh levels of tryptophan.\nYou can look up what those are.\nSo, white meat turkey, for instance,\ncertain complex carbohydrates can often\nbe rich with tryptophan.\nThat consuming those foods can enhance\nthe amount of serotonin\nthat's available in the brain\nand blood and thereby\nlead to the particular\nquality of sleep that\nallows for more deep healing\nor for when I say deep healing,\nI mean for a more robust immune response.\nNow, again, those are still emerging data.\nWhat is very clear, however,\nis that during sleep and in particular,\nduring sleep that's associated\nwith the early stage\nof any kind of viral\nor bacterial infection,\nthe so-called glymphatic\nsystem is much more active\nthan it would be normally.\nWhat's the glymphatic system?\nThe glymphatic system is actually\na relatively recent discovery.\nI mentioned lymph and the\nlymphatic system earlier,\nthe glymphatic system with a\nG, is a system in the brain\nby which debris that\naccumulates throughout the day,\nbut in particular, debris that\naccumulates under conditions\nof neuroinflammation and\ninflammation of the body,\nis cleared out or is\nwashed out of the brain.\nAnd the activity of this glymphatic system\nis extremely important for the recovery\nfrom infection of any kind.\nAnd it's now becoming clear,\nis important for recovery\nfrom traumatic head injury,\nand maybe even from psychological trauma.\nSo, the glymphatic system can\nbe thought of more or less\nas a plumbing system that\nruns through the ventricles,\nbut also mainly through\nthe lining that sits\nbetween the brain and the skull\nand some of the other tissues\nand things of that sort.\nThe choroid is involved as well.\nBrain imaging reveals\nthe glymphatic system\nis very active during deep sleep.\nAnd there's this kind of wash\nout of the glymphatic system.\nAnd I am aware of some\nstudies that are ongoing now\nwhere augmenting the serotonin\nsystem through either\nsupplementation of tryptophan or 5-HTP\nor even serotonin itself,\nthese are laboratory studies,\nis being looked at for\nits capacity to increase\nthe amount of circulation\nin the glymphatic system.\nAnd the idea is that it might,\nand I want to underscore might,\npotentially lead to more\nrapid recovery from injury\nand illness and potentially\nramp up, if you will,\nthe activity of the immune system.\nSo, it essentially is a\nramping up of the activity\nof the immune system.\nNow, regardless of whether\nor not you decide to,\nfor instance, supplement with\n5-HTP before sleep or not,\nI'll talk about what that\nmight look like in a moment,\nthere is a way that you\ncan increase the activity\nof your glymphatic system\nunder normal circumstances.\nBecause of the mechanics\nof the glymphatic system,\nit turns out that if\nyou elevate your heels\nby about 12 degrees, it\ndoesn't have to be exactly 12,\nas you sleep by putting\nmaybe a rolled pillow\nor two pillows underneath your feet,\nby having the head below your legs.\nIt seems that there's\nmore glymphatic washout\nor clearance during sleep.\nAnd this is without taking any compound\nto adjust the serotonin system.\nSo I would say if you're not feeling well,\nyes, take the hot shower.\nYes, get into bed and go to sleep,\nbut elevate your feet to try and increase\nthe activity of the glymphatic system.\nSome might even consider\nthat if you have to be awake,\nthat you might want to be awake\nwith your feet elevated above your head.\nNow that might not be\npractical for the workplace,\nbut it might be practical for\na short nap during the day\nor something of that sort.\nThe glymphatic system is not\njust active during sleep.\nIt's also active during\ncertain phases of waking,\nin particular when we are in\na deep state of relaxation.\nSo as many of you probably\nknow I'm a big proponent\nof self-hypnosis because of the quality\nscientific literature on this.\nIf you're interested in self-hypnosis,\nyou can go to Reverie, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.\nReverie is a cost-free\napp for Apple and Android\nthat was developed by my\ncolleague, David Spiegel,\nand others at the Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine,\nbased on quality studies\nand peer reviewed data,\nshowing that deep states\nof relaxation can be used\nto improve pain management,\nimprove transition time to sleep,\nand a number of other things.\nYou can select the\nvarious sort of outcomes\nthat you're seeking using Reverie.\nIt's a great thing especially for people\nthat are challenged with\nmeditation could use,\nbecause you just listened to the script.\nIt involves deep relaxation.\nI would suggest using that\nscript, or the script for sleep,\nbut with feet elevated\nto increase activity\nof the glymphatic system.\nNow, if you do decide\nthat you want to test out\nthis serotonin hypothesis on your own,\nobviously check with a doctor.\nI'm not a doctor, I'm a professor.\nSo, I'm professing things,\nnot suggesting things,\nbut 5-HTP is a supplement\nthat I've talked about before\non this podcast that I\nactually do not recommend\nfor most people for sake of sleep,\nbecause it can disrupt the\nnormal architecture of sleep\nand create a deep sleep\nearly in the night,\nand then a spontaneous\nwaking with some trouble\nto get back to sleep.\nAnd that's because of the\nway that the serotonin system\nand the melatonin system interact.\nHowever, under conditions\nwhere one is feeling\nlike they might have an infection\nor an early stage of illness,\nin that case, 5-HTP might\nbe a useful supplement\nin order to access these states of sleep\nthat are not typical.\nThey're not the typical deep\nsleep that you would achieve\nwhen you're feeling healthy.\nThese are states of sleep\nthat are specifically there\nin order to try and repair\nsome of the immune system\nrelated inflammation that's occurring.\nIf you'd like to explore\nthe 5-HTP approach\nand you feel it's right and safe for you,\nand you've talked to your doctor,\nit's 300 to 500 milligrams\ntaken about 30 to 60 minutes\nbefore going to sleep for the night.\nThat's the typical protocol.\nNot incidentally,\nincreasing serotonin is also\none typical approach for the\ntreatment of major depression.\nThis is the basis for things like SSRIs,\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,\nlike Prozac and Zoloft, and so forth.\nThe 5-HTP approach is\na much milder approach\nthan prescription drug, of course,\nbut will allow more serotonin\nto be synthesized and/or released.\nNow, for those of you that are\ninterested in learning more\nabout the glymphatic system,\nit's a fascinating system,\nand you might want to do a deep dive there\nin terms of the behavioral protocols,\nand what's known about it,\nthere's a wonderful article called\n\"The Glymphatic System:\nA Beginner's Guide.\"\nThis is a scientific article.\nThe first author is Jessen is\nthe last name, J-E-S-S-E-N.\nIf you put in \"Jessen,\nThe Glymphatic System:\nA Beginner's Guide,\" you\ncan access the full length\nmanuscript easily online.\nIt'll show up immediately in your search.\nAnd in a really interesting way,\nthe glymphatic system\nhas now also been tied\nto the iron deposition system.\nEarlier we were talking\nabout iron and how,\nof course, getting enough\ndietary iron is important,\nbut if levels of iron are too high\nit isn't good for a number of reasons.\nThere's a very interesting article\nthat just came out last year called\n\"Dysfunction of the glymphatic\nsystem might be related\nto iron deposition in\nthe normal aging brain.\"\nSo, we're starting to see these links\nbetween iron levels being too high,\nthe glymphatic system not being\nactive enough and so forth,\nleading to sickness\nbehavior, inflammation,\nand maybe even damage to\nneurons associated with aging.\nWe can flip that on its\nhead and say that increasing\nthe activity of the glymphatic system,\nfeet elevated during deep sleep,\nmaybe even feet elevated\nabove the head while awake,\nduring a nap or doing a Reverie script\nonce a day or something of that sort,\ncould increase the activity\nof the glymphatic system,\nlowering iron to a point\nthat's probably below\nthe typical intake during\nperiods of infection,\nperhaps, I should say,\ncan enhance the glymphatic\nsystem and vice versa.\nAnd then you've got this specialized sleep\nthat's related to sickness behavior\nthat seems to have heightened\nlevels of serotonin\nthat might be augmented\nby ingesting 5-HTP.\nAgain, not on a regular basis.\nI don't suggest that people take compounds\nthat increase serotonin\nunless it's prescribed\nto you for depression or something,\nbut not doing by supplement\nwith tryptophan or 5-HTP\non a regular basis, but\nonly under conditions\nwhere as I mentioned, you\nmight be starting to feel sick\nor you're coming down with something,\nor you're combating\nsome sort of infection.\nSo if we consider the\nadvice that we typically get\nwhen we're not feeling\nwell of take a hot shower,\nget into bed and go to sleep,\nand we've now touched on\nways to potentially increase\nthe efficacy of the sleep part through\nthe glymphatic and the serotonin system.\nWhat about the take a hot shower part?\nIs that good advice?\nWell, it turns out it is,\nand there's actually a\nway to do even better.\nThere's a study, a very interesting study,\nthe title reveals where\nI'm going with this,\nit's \"Effect of a single\nFinnish sauna session\non white blood cell profile\nand cortisol levels.\"\nIn this case, it was done in\nathletes and non-athletes,\nwhich is kind of nice.\nThis involves taking\nathletes and non-athletes\nand exposing them to sauna.\nIt wasn't particularly hot.\nIt was 96 degrees, which isn't cool,\nbut it's not really hot.\nNowadays you hear about people\ndoing very, very hot sauna.\nThe humidity of the sauna,\nif you want to know,\nis 15 plus or minus 3%.\nBut basically what they found\nwas that just one 15 minutes\nsauna session could really increase\nwhite blood cell profiles and\ncould adjust cortisol levels\nin ways that were beneficial\nfor combating infection.\nAnd now there are many\nother studies like this.\nNow, this should immediately\nmake sense based on\nwhat we said before about fever;\nheating up can actually\nhelp combat infection.\nBut for those of you that have listened\nto the episodes on temperature,\nwhat you probably know is\nthat when you get into a sauna\nor any kind of hot environment,\nyour body is also going to be actively\npushing to cool itself off.\nSo, there's probably an increase in heat,\nthere is an increase in heating,\nbut then afterwards\nyour body will cool off,\nmaybe even with a dip below baseline.\nI do want to provide a cautionary note\nthat if you are already running a fever,\ngetting into a sauna could\ntake your body temperature\ninto dangerously high levels,\ndangerously meaning you can kill neurons.\nAnd once you kill neurons,\nthey do not come back.\nSo, please don't kill your neurons.\nI don't recommend getting into a sauna\nif you're already running a fever.\nSo this would be something\nto do at the initial stage\nof an infection or if you're\nfeeling a little bit off.\nSo this is kind of a ramping\nup or a super protocol\nof the typical advice of take\na hot shower and get into bed.\nThat is good advice.\nNow we're talking about a hot sauna,\nprobably showering off\nand then getting into bed,\nmaybe augmenting serotonin.\nI know many people don't\nhave access to sauna.\nSo, in that case, a\nvery hot bath or shower,\ndon't scald yourself, of course,\nbut as hot as you can comfortably tolerate\nor right at that edge\nof what you can tolerate\nwould be a good idea.\nSome people I've heard are creating saunas\nin their bathrooms by running hot water\nand creating a ton of steam.\nAnything that really heats you up,\nbut not to dangerously high levels\nis going to be beneficial.\nIf you have access to a sauna, terrific.\nThis again was only 15 minutes.\nThey'd had a cool off session.\nWould you get more of an increase?\nPeople always want to know\nif you did it twice as much,\nwould you get twice an increase?\nThose data don't really exist yet.\nHowever, if you are\ninterested in maximizing\nthe effects of sauna,\nit is clear that a cool\noff period is important.\nSo it's not that a 15\nminute sauna is good,\nand a 30 minute sauna is better.\nIf you are going to take\nthat route of exploring more,\nit does seem that doing a\n15 minute heating period\nfollowed by a five to 10\nminute cooling period,\nand then getting back into\nthe heat can be beneficial.\nAnd this is interesting.\nIt gets to the mechanisms by\nwhich the hypothalamus areas,\nthe areas of the hypothalamus, that is,\nthat generate increases in body heat,\nthe activation of those\nneurons occurs as you heat up\nand then were you to just stay\nin that heated environment,\nthey would actually shut\noff and some other neurons\nwould be handling the job so to speak.\nBut by getting in and out\nof the heated environment,\nyou actually force that\nsystem to send repeated pulses\nof these cortisol lowering\nand white cell stimulating\nsignals to the body.\nSome of you have probably\nheard the phrase,\n\"feed a fever, starve a cold.\"\nI don't know who first said that.\nI couldn't find the\ncitation, but we hear this.\nAnd we can speculate that\nthe reason that phrase,\n\"feed a fever, starve a cold\" came to be\nis because of the adaptive\nfunction of fever,\nthat increases in body\ntemperature make it challenging\nfor intruding viruses\nand bacteria to survive.\nEven though, of course, highly\nelevated body temperatures\npose a danger to the\nhost organism, to you.\nFeeding, eating does cause an\nincrease in body temperature\nthrough the so-called\nthermogenic effect of food.\nSo I can understand the\nlogic of feed a fever.\nIt would mean that when you have a fever,\nit's your body's natural\nattempt to heat up\nand kill some invading thing.\nAnd by eating, you would further increase\nyour body temperature.\nWhy you would want to starve\na cold, I don't know, however.\nMaybe it's because when your\nnasal passages are congested,\nit's uncomfortable to eat\nor something of that sort.\nSo the feet of fever\npart makes sense to me,\nthe starve a cold part is\nstill mysterious to me.\nI couldn't find any logical\nreason why that would be good.\nThere are communities out\nthere that believe that fasting\nis a viable way to combat\ncertain types of infection.\nFasting, in particular, prolonged fasts,\ndo increase the amount of adrenaline,\nalso called epinephrin,\nin the brain and body.\nAnd as we'll next explain, epinephrin,\nadrenaline does have a powerful effect on\nthe various inflammatory cytokines\nand on the immune system in general.\nSo, let's talk about a behavioral protocol\nthat anyone can use; it\ndoesn't involve any equipment,\nyou don't need a sauna, you\ndon't need anything at all,\nthat has been demonstrated\nin excellent peer reviewed\nresearch to enhance the\nfunction of the immune system\nand actually allow people\nto combat infection\nin very dramatic ways.\nNext, I'd like to do an\nin-depth analysis of a study\nthat has achieved some\nprominence out there,\nnot just in the scientific\nliterature, but on the internet,\nbecause it relates to how\nparticular types of breathing\ncan impact the immune system\nand the ability to combat infection.\nThe title of this paper is\n\"Voluntary activation of the\nsympathetic nervous system\nand attenuation of the innate\nimmune response in humans.\"\nThis is a paper that\nwas published in PNAS,\nwhich is the Proceedings\nof the National Academy\nof Sciences, USA.\nIt's a very prestigious journal.\nFor those of you that know PNAS,\nyou know that there are certain\npapers published in PNAS,\nor there used to be that\nwere not peer reviewed.\nIn recent years, I think\nall of them have moved\nto peer reviewed papers.\nSo this is a peer reviewed,\nvery high quality study.\nAnd I just want to describe\nthe basic contour of the study.\nI'll explain the findings,\nand then I want to go in-depth\nand explain the mechanistic\nbasis for these findings\nand the protocol that we can\nall export from these findings.\nSo, here we go.\nFirst of all, a couple of\nterms so that everybody\nis on the same page.\nThe sympathetic nervous\nsystem is one division\nof our nervous system.\nIt's a set of neurons down\nthe middle of our spinal cord\nand in our brain that generally\nlead to a heightened state\nof arousal and alertness.\nIt's associated with\nepinephrin release in the brain\nand adrenaline release in the body.\nIt's the so-called fight or flight system\nwhen it's really active,\nbut it's the system that's\nactive when we are wide awake.\nAnd we already talked about\nthe innate immune system.\nThat's that first line of\ndefense after the skin barrier,\nof course, whereby some\ninfection comes into the body\nand there's this rapid response\nof increasing inflammation.\nAnd that's also about the time\nthat you first feel lousy.\nSo when you start to feel like,\n\"ugh, I think I've got something.\nI don't feel right, a headache.\nI feel nauseous.\nI'm heating up.\nI don't feel good.\"\nThat's the innate immune\nsystem kicking in.\nSo what they did in this study,\nand by the way, I should say they,\nthis first author is Kox, K-O-X,\nlast author, last name\nPickkers, P-I-C-K-K-E-R-S.\nWhat they did was they\nexposed human subjects\nto an endotoxin.\nIn other words, they\ninjected people with E. coli,\nwhich is a bacteria which makes people,\nall people feel terrible.\nMakes you nauseous,\nfever, vomiting, diarrhea,\nit's very unpleasant, okay?\nThese people voluntarily\nsigned up for this study.\nHowever, some of the\nsubjects in this study\nperformed a behavioral protocol\nthat can best be described\nas cyclic hyperventilation.\nMy lab works on these types\nof breathing protocols.\nThis is not work that my lab did,\nbut basically subjects hyperventilate,\nfollowed by breath\nretention, by breath holds,\nand I'll explain exactly what they did.\nThey also looked at other\nforms of behavioral protocols,\nbut let's focus on that one.\nSo, they're comparing\ncontrols that do just sort\nof a basic meditation\nversus people that do\nthis intense breathing\nfollowed by some breath holds.\nI'm just paraphrasing here,\nin the intervention group,\nthe breathing group,\nplasma levels of\nanti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10,\nso this is a cytokine that\nis lowers inflammation,\nincreased after endotoxin administration.\nAnd that was triggered by an increase\nin epinephrin and adrenaline.\nSo, in other words,\ndoing a particular pattern\nof breathing allowed\nan anti-inflammatory\ncytokine to be turned on,\nwhereas that was not\nthe case in the subjects\nthat did not do this\nparticular breathing protocol.\nAnd they discovered that levels\nof proinflammatory TNF-alpha,\ntumor necrosis factor alpha,\nIL-6, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8,\nwhich you should all be familiar with now,\nas proinflammatory cytokines were lower\nin the intervention group.\nWhereas these IL-10 levels\nthat are anti-inflammatory went up.\nFinally, flu-like symptoms were lower\nin the intervention group.\nSo this is an amazing finding, right?\nThese are human subjects.\nOne group of subjects is\ndoing this breathing protocol.\nThe other group of subjects\nis just meditating.\nBoth sets of subjects have\nbeen injected with E. coli.\nSo, you know everyone's\ngetting the same amount\nplaced into their system.\nThis is very, very interesting.\nAnd it leads to the question\nthat every good scientist,\ntwo year old or health\ninformation seeker asks,\nwhich is why?\nHow?\nHow in the world does this work?\nWhy does this work?\nWell to make a long story shortish,\nbecause I am going to go into depth here,\nthe reason it works is\nbecause the sympathetic\nnervous system, the so-called stress part\nof our nervous system, it's\nnot really called that,\nbut the part of our nervous\nsystem that triggers stress\nfrom mild stress, to severe\nstress, even to panic,\ncauses the release of\nadrenaline and epinephrin\nin the brain and body.\nAnd under normal circumstances,\nwhen we have some sort\nof invading infection,\nour body is able to push back on that,\nto resist it by engaging\nthe stress response.\nSo what's happening here is\nthere's a behavioral protocol\ninvolving the nervous\nsystem, 'cause all behaviors\nare generated from the\nnervous system of course.\nA behavioral protocol that\npeople are deliberately employing\nthat allows them to activate\nthe sympathetic nervous system,\nwhich in turn allows them to\nactivate the normal pathways\nby which immune system\nfunction is enhanced.\nOkay?\nNow, the reason I'm\nunderscoring this is that\nthe common interpretation of\nthis study is that somehow\nit blocks the normal immune response,\nbut that's not really\nwhat's happening here.\nYes, there's a reduction\nin inflammatory cytokines\nand there's an increase in\nanti-inflammatory cytokines,\nbut that's not really the same thing\nas blocking the immune response.\nThis could just as easily\nbe viewed as enhancing\nthe immune response and\ncombating the intruder,\nin this case, E. coli.\nSo, let's parse this study\na little bit more closely.\nFirst of all, what is this\nmagical pattern of breathing?\nSome of you may recognize this\nas so-called Wim Hof breathing.\nWim, of course the Dutchman.\nI think his occupation online used to be\nlisted as daredevil, believe\nit or not, on Wikipedia.\nThat's a pretty cool occupation.\nWim is best known for his\nactivities with cold exposure,\nhe holds multiple world records for that,\nswimming under icebergs\nand other incredible feats,\nthat you definitely\ndon't want to try unless\nyou're extremely skilled and really know\nwhat you're doing, as he does,\nbut also for the use of breath work.\nThe breathing that is\nso-called Wim Hof breathing\nis very similar, not exactly the same,\nbut very similar to Tummo breathing,\nas it's been described historically.\nIn the science and physiology community\nand in my laboratory, 'cause\nI run a university laboratory,\nwe refer to it as cyclic hyperventilation,\nwhich just means repeated\ndeep breaths in and out.\nAnd then there are these retentions.\nSo, because I'm here\nin the hot seat anyway,\nI might as well demonstrate it for you\nso you know what this looks like.\nThere are variations on\nthis, so with respect to Wim,\nwith respect to Tummo practitioners,\nwith respect to the cyclic\nhyperventilators everywhere,\nthis is one general theme of it.\nIt involves 20 to 30 deep inhales\nand then exhales through the mouth,\nfollowed by a exhale of all one's air\nand a breath hold, that's the retention.\nAnd then at some point,\n15 to 60 seconds later,\nrepeating the 25 or 30 breaths.\nAnd then again, a breath\nhold with lungs empty.\nThere are variations on this,\nbut in our laboratory and\nin this particular study,\nit looks something like this.\nOkay, I'm not going to do\nthe whole thing right now,\nbut it goes something like this.\n[Andrew deeply breathing]\nOkay, so let's assume I\ndid that for 30 breaths.\nI can already feel myself\nperspiring a little bit.\nYou're heating up, that's\nthe release of adrenaline.\nIt's caused by that breathing pattern,\nand then exhaling all of one's air,\nno speaking in between like I'm doing.\n[Andrew deeply exhaling]\nAnd then sitting lungs empty\nuntil one feels the impulse\nto breathe and then\nrepeating for several rounds,\ntwo or three or even four rounds.\nNow some people will also\nintroduce a big inhale\nand breath hold at the end\nand find that indeed they can\nhold their breath much longer\nthan they normally would be able to.\nBecause the trigger to\nbreathe is normally activated\nby increases in carbon\ndioxide in our blood.\nWe have neurons in our brain stem\nand in our various regions\nof our brain, actually,\nthat respond to when\ncarbon dioxide is too high\nand trigger the reflex to breathe.\nBut when we exhale deeply,\nwe blow off a lot of carbon dioxide\nso we don't feel that impulse\nto breathe come quite as soon.\nBasically this study\nlooked at people doing\nthese cyclic hyperventilation\nwith retention,\n25 or 30 breaths, then the retention,\n25 or 30 breaths, then retention,\n25 or 30 breaths, then the retention.\nSo, three rounds of 25 to 30\nbreaths followed by exhale,\nhold in between of various duration.\nBut in general, 15 to\n60 seconds is typical.\nWhat happened physiologically?\nThis is one of the\nreasons I like this study.\nWhat happened physiologically?\nWell, a couple of things.\nOf course, blood oxygenation drops.\nYou would expect that\nbased on hyperventilation\nand especially based on the exhale\nof so much carbon dioxide.\nWe could explain why that is,\nbut blood levels of oxygen drop.\nThe pH, the alkalinity\nof the body goes way up.\nThis is very interesting.\nIf you look up this paper,\nyou can look at Figure One,\nPanel C, the pH goes way up.\nPeople become alkaline.\nYou've heard before of alkaline water.\nI hate to say this,\nI'll probably lose some friends for this,\nbut yeah, don't waste your money\non drinking alkaline water.\nYou can't really shift the\nalkalinity of your body.\nThere are cases where some\ncompartment in your body\nneeds to be more alkaline than the rest.\nYour gut is a different\nalkalinity than other areas\nof your body, et cetera, but\ningesting high alkaline water\nisn't going to shift\nyour overall alkalinity.\nIf someone can send me a quality reference\nthat shows different than I'm happy\nto revise that statement.\nBut in any case, doing\nthat pattern of breathing\nthat I just described\ngreatly increases the pH.\nGreatly, I should say,\nit doesn't send it off\ninto dangerous levels.\nIt takes it from 7.4 to 7.6,\nwhich is a significant\nincrease in alkalinity.\nSo, as pH levels, for those\nyou remember high school\nor college chemistry, as the\nnumbers on the pH go down,\nyou're becoming more acidic,\nas they go up, you're\nbecoming more alkaline,\nokay or more basic.\nSo, these subjects went from 7.4 to 7.6\nduring the breathing,\nand then afterwards it returned to normal.\nBut that shift in alkalinity is thought\nto be important here.\nSo, what's going on here?\nHow is the breathing\nleading to the shifts in...\nOr I should say reduction\nin inflammatory cytokines\nand an increase in the liberation\nof these anti-inflammatory cytokines.\nWell, the authors make some good arguments\nas to why it's not the shift in pH per se,\nor the shift in carbon\ndioxide levels in the blood,\nbut rather it's the release of epinephrin.\nAnd there's some good reason\nto believe why that's the case.\nIt's beyond the scope of this discussion,\nbut that it's actually\nthe release of epinephrin,\nAKA adrenaline, that's\ncausing this reduction\nin inflammation.\nAnd that's actually supported by something\nthat you've probably experienced before,\nwhich is if you've ever\nworked, worked, worked, worked,\nworked really hard, or\nyou've been a caretaker\nfor somebody else or studying for exams,\nand people around you are getting sick\nand you're just powering through it\nand you're not getting sick,\nbut then you stop, you\nturn in your final exam,\nyou stopped taking care of somebody else,\nor you finally stop and\nrest or you go on vacation,\nand then you get sick.\nWell, you've just experienced\nthe effect that adrenaline,\nepinephrin can have in\nactivating your immune system\nby way of the nervous system,\nin order to keep fighting\nand combating infection.\nAnd that brings us to a larger theme,\nwhich is that stress and\ncombating infection or a wound\nis not one unique system.\nIt's the same stress system that you use\nto combat psychological stress.\nSo when you're very, very stressed,\nat least in the short term,\nbecause you release so much\nadrenaline and epinephrin,\nyou're actually better\nable to combat infections\nand you reduce inflammation\nand the whole feeling\nlousy response, right?\nRemember reduced flu-like symptoms here.\nSo this pattern of breathing\nis actually a very useful tool.\nAnd I confess, I use this\npattern of breathing anytime\nI am at the initial stages\nof getting some sort of bug.\nIf I feel like I've been\nrunning myself ragged,\nor if I somehow, for whatever reason,\nhave a tickle in my throat,\nor I have that kind of\nsensation in my nose,\nlike I might've caught a bug of some sort,\nI will do this pattern of breathing.\nI've been doing it consistently,\ngosh, for the last four years or more.\nNow this is just anecdotal reports,\nbut I find that it allows\nme indeed to either\nhave those early symptoms disappear,\nor it allows me to just\nkind of push through\nand harder, longer.\nI don't suggest people\ncontinue to push through\nexposure to infections.\nObviously you don't want\nto infect other people,\nnor do you want to crash and\nsuddenly get a massive illness\nof some sort because you\nstopped doing this breathing.\nBut I do think it's a useful tool.\nIt's a purely behavioral\nintervention that has been shown\nhere and now there are\nadditional studies on the way,\nto enhance the function\nof your immune system\nand to reduce inflammation.\nAnd this is to me, one of\nthe most concrete examples\nof a zero cost tool that\nbridges the activation\nof the nervous system through breathing\nwith the immune system by\nway of releasing adrenaline\nand thereby reducing the terrible effects\nor feelings of lousiness\nfrom, in this case,\nan E. coli infection.\nNow, I'd like to focus on a\ncouple of important points\nthat I haven't heard\ndiscussed broadly elsewhere,\nwhich is that the hyperventilation\nand the breath retention\nare both important.\nSo you can't simply\nhyperventilate to get this effect\nat the level of epinephrin release\nand reduction in inflammatory cytokines.\nIt's been shown before that\nthe hyperventilation phase\nand the hypoxia, which is\na low oxygen saturation\ndue to the breath retention,\nthey both combine to increase\nepinephrin adrenaline levels.\nSo, you have to do the 25 or 30 breaths,\nand then the retention.\n25 or 30 breaths then the retention,\nmeaning that the exhale\nwith the breath hold,\nin order to get the full effect.\nI'd also want to provide a\ncritical cautionary note.\nDon't do this anywhere near\nwater or while driving a car.\nThese things might seem kind of obvious,\nbut obviously in the off\nchance that you black out\nor something like that,\nit could be disastrous.\nSo, please be careful.\nAnd again, don't try and\npush the breath hold.\nThe moment you feel the impulse\nto breathe, just breathe.\nAnd it did seem that the three\nrounds of 25 to 30 breaths\nwith breath hold retentions in between\nwas the ideal protocol.\nThere's one last very\ninteresting feature of this study\nthat I want to emphasize.\nAnd that was that they\nactually measured the so-called\ncatecholamine concentrations.\nCatecholamines are things like dopamine,\nepinephrin, norepinephrine.\nThese are chemicals in your\nnervous system and body\nthat promote states of\nalertness, dopamine, of course,\npart of the reward and\nmotivation pathways.\nThey explored the levels of\nthese molecules in blood,\nin plasma during and after\nthis breathing protocol.\nAnd it was interesting,\nas I mentioned before,\nepinephrin showed robust\nincreases compared\nto the control group,\nnorepinephrine, significant\nincreases occurred\nin the breathing group,\nin the cyclic hyperventilation\nretention breathing group,\nof course, but less so.\nAnd dopamine levels\nactually dropped somewhat.\nBut this is very interesting\nbecause there's a new\nand emerging literature largely from Asya,\nA-Y-S-A Rolls' lab in Israel.\nWhat her laboratory has shown\nis that motivational state\nand mindset has a powerful\nimpact on various aspects\nof the immune system\nthat were thought to be\nindependent of the brain\nand mind and thinking.\nSo this brings us back to\nsomething that we discussed\nat the very beginning of this episode,\nwhich is that 20, 30 years ago,\nthe idea that you could\nheal the body with the mind\nwas considered kind of quackery.\nI think that there was an\nintervening period up until now\nwhere people might've said,\n\"sure, if you're stressed out,\nit's going to make things worse.\"\nI mean, I think everyone\nagrees that stress\nmakes every thing worse at some level,\noutcomes to neurodegeneration,\nperformance in a physical\nendeavors and mental endeavors.\nIf stress is too high for too long\npeople experience different challenges\nand essentially every\nmajor psychiatric disorder,\neverything suffers, but in the short term,\nstress can actually be\nbeneficial in the ways\nthat we just described.\nAnd stress, if we break it down\nis really a neurochemical state, right?\nIt's the release of these catacholamines.\nAnd what Asya Rolls' laboratory has shown\nis that when the so-called dopamine system\nand at several episodes,\nI described there are\nmultiple dopamine systems,\nbut the so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway\ninvolving areas like the\nnucleus accumbens, et cetera.\nWhen the reward system that's\nassociated with dopamine\nand norepinephrine is activated,\nyou see incredible effects,\nincluding for instance,\nhighly significant reduction\nin tumor size in cancers.\nNow, why would that be?\nHow is it that mindset,\ndopamine and tumors,\nand tumor growth are somehow linked?\nWe now know how this\noccurs largely through\nthe incredible work of\nAsya Rolls and others.\nSo, now I'd like to turn our\nfocus to how it is specifically\nthat certain mindsets\nimpact the immune system\nin ways that we can\nactually point to specific\nbiological pathways and\nalso specific protocols\nrelated to mindset.\nI guess a simple way to frame\nall this would be to say\nthat most of us are\naware that yes, indeed,\nyou can worry yourself sick.\nWe've been told that, you're\ngoing to worry yourself sick.\nAnd actually there was a\npaper published in \"Science,\"\nagain, one of the top\nthree journals out there,\nthe top three really being\n\"Nature,\" \"Science,\" and \"Cell.\"\nAnd then other of course,\nexcellent journals exist,\nbut this was a paper that came\nout in \"Science\" last year.\nFirst author is Kataoka, K-A-T-A-O-K-A,\ndescribing psychogenic stress and fever.\nSo this was looking or\nasking the question,\nare there areas of the\nbrain that actually underlie\nthis notion that we can\nworry ourselves sick?\nAnd they discovered a new\npathway and they were able to\nboth activate this pathway\nindependent of worry and stress\nand see illness occur,\nand they were able to\ninhibit this pathway,\nblock activity in this neural pathway\nand prevent psychogenic\nfever and the worrying\nof oneself sick.\nSo, they were able to do this\nin a very controlled way.\nI'll just mention the pathway in case\nyou want to look it up in more detail.\nThis is a corticolimbic pathway.\nSo, just to orient us,\nthe cortex is more or less\nthe outer shell of the brain.\nIt's involved in thinking\nand sensation and perceptions\nand learning and maintenance\nof a lot of memories\nare stored there.\nWe all hear that you learn and\nremember in the hippocampus,\nthat's the initial site\nof learning and memory,\nbut then that information,\nbelieve it or not,\nis passed off to the\ncortex where it's stored\nin kind of a long-term\nhard drive type storage.\nSo the corticolimbic\npathway is one in which\nyour thoughts, your prior\nexperiences can literally\nin a structure way, feed down\nonto the areas of the brain\nthat control very basal processes,\nincluding temperature regulation.\nSo this is a corticolimbic\nhypothalamic pathway.\nWe talked earlier about the hypothalamus\nas controlling temperature\nand a lot of sickness\nrelated behavior, right?\nRemember vagus up to the hypothalamus\nand all the sleep more,\nless appetite, fever.\nOkay, that's all in the hypothalamus.\nThis is a top-down corticolimbic\nhypothalamic pathway,\nand it has a fancy name.\nIt's the dorsal peduncular\ncortex, dorsal tinea tecta.\nThe short of that is the DP/DTT.\nLet's just call it the DP/DTT,\nto the dorsomedial hypothalamus.\nA lot of D's.\nIt shouldn't mean anything.\nIt doesn't really matter what we call it.\nBut what's important is\nconceptually it's a pathway\nthat originates insights to the brain\nthat are associated with thinking,\nwith emotion and with prior history,\nand feeds directly into\nan area of the brain\nthat's involved in basic physiological\nsubconsciously controlled processes.\nSo, that's incredible, right?\nAnd it points to a physical\npathway by which the way\nwe think about something\nchanges something core\nabout our physiology.\nNow, in some ways that\nshouldn't be surprising, right?\nIf you think about\nsomething that excites you,\nyour heart rate can increase.\nYou think about something\nthat terrifies you,\nyour heart rate can increase.\nSo the idea that thinking\ncontrols our physiology\nis not a new concept at all,\nbut somehow human beings,\nwe have been challenged with\nthe idea that we could actually\nthink ourselves into being sick.\nBut this paper from Kataoka\nshows that if you expose\nsomebody to a psychological stress,\nyou can actually activate this\npathway and create a fever.\nAnd how do they do that?\nWell, you can do this by exposing subjects\nto a very stressful real event,\nand you cue it through\nour associative learning.\nSo, maybe, like my PILOT\nV5s, which I love so much,\nwe could traumatize me to the PILOT V5\nif I had some horrible\nexperience happen to me\nwhile I'm looking at and\nconcentrating on the PILOT V5.\nThen you take away the\nhorrible experience,\nyou give me the PILOT V5,\nand I start to experience\na lot of the symptoms\nassociated with that terrible event.\nThey were able to do this\nusing sickness inducing stimuli\nand so forth.\nThey did all the various derivations\nand identified this pathway\nthat when activated,\neven in the absence of\nsome horrible event,\ncould create fever and\nillness-like behavior and so forth.\nAnd if they blocked certain stations\nalong this neural pathway,\nthey could block that effect.\nSo this is really concrete\nevidence, proof, if you will,\nthat there are dedicated\npathways in the mammalian brain,\nyour brain and mine,\nthat allow us to turn\nthoughts into illness.\nThat's kind of a depressing idea.\nWhat about the inverse?\nWhat about turning thoughts into health?\nWell, that's the work of Asya Rolls.\nThey explored the well-established\npsychological phenomenon\nthat when cancer patients\nor very ill people\nor people who are suffering\nfrom very debilitating injuries,\nwhen people had a\nreported a sense of hope,\ntheir rates of recovery\nwere much higher, right?\nSounds very subjective.\nBut what is a sense of hope?\nA sense of hope is a sense of the future.\nA sense of the future\nis tightly associated\nwith the dopamine system.\nDopamine, again, being\nthis molecule of reward\nand motivation and movement,\nbut movement and motivation are\nabout things that are beyond\nthe confines of our skin\nand are about the future.\nAnd so what they've discovered\nand through other studies\nfrom other groups have\ndiscovered is that stimulation\nof the dopamine pathway,\neither simply by thinking about a future,\nideally a positive future,\nbut thinking about a positive\nfuture leads to activation\nof the so-called mesolimbic reward pathway\nand could reduce the size of tumors,\ncould accelerate wound healing,\ncould greatly accelerate the\npassage from a state of illness\nto a state of health and wellbeing.\nSo there are many, many\nstudies now starting\nto wick out related to this.\nThere's also the idea that\naugmenting the dopamine system\ncan increase the rate of healing.\nAnd so, there are individuals\nout there who opt,\nfor instance, to take things\nthat increase dopamine.\nNow, obviously drugs of abuse\nwould not be a good idea\nin this context, even though\nthey increase dopamine,\nthey lead to big crashes,\nthey have addictive properties, et cetera.\nI've talked before on\nthis podcast about things\nlike L-tyrosine, taking anywhere\nfrom 500 to 750 milligrams\ncan increase dopamine because tyrosine\nis a dopamine precursor, of course.\nThings like Mucuna\npruriens, which are L-dopa,\nthe immediate precursor to dopamine.\nSome of these will lead\nto somewhat of a crash\nin certain individuals.\nOther people tolerate\nthem a little bit better.\nAgain, you have to talk to your doctor,\nyou have to figure out\nwhat's right for you.\nIf you have bipolar or\nmania or schizophrenia,\nthese things, I would not\nrecommend them at all.\nI'm not recommending them at all,\nI'm just mentioning them\nfor potential exploration\nif it's safe and right for you.\nBut the point is this:\nthe dopamine system, when\nactivated can accelerate healing,\nit can accelerate the recovery\nfrom injury of all kinds.\nAnd that shouldn't come as a mystery\nor surprise result to us.\nIt's because this reward\npathway and the fact\nthat it's related to a sense of the future\nseems to liberate entire\nsystems within the body\nthat make inflammatory cytokines go down,\nand anti-inflammatory cytokines go up.\nExactly as was demonstrated\nin the beautiful PNAS study\nwhere breathing, cyclic hyperventilation,\nwas used to increase epinephrin,\nincrease norepinephrine,\nand to augment the catecholamine system.\nSo, I think that the bridges\nbetween these studies\nare really relevant.\nIn one case, I'm talking about potentially\ntaking an over-the-counter\ncompound to increase dopamine\nto accelerate healing.\nIn another case, we're\ntalking about using breathing.\nThere's also the use\nof cold water exposure\nto increase dopamine.\nI talked about this several episodes ago,\nbut it's been shown that\nimmersing oneself in cold water\nup to the neck or so.\nHow cold?\nWell, it depends on what you can tolerate,\nbut uncomfortably cold,\nbut not so cold that\nyou become hypothermic,\nbut where it's challenging to get in,\nbut you can stay there for\nthree to 10 minutes or so,\nhas been shown to lead\nto very significant,\nup to doubling or more of\nbaseline dopamine levels\nand epinephrin levels that\ngo on for several hours.\nThis may be the basis for why\npeople will do cold showers\nor ice baths and then get into a sauna.\nSo, what's called\ncold-heat contrast therapy,\nas a way to augment\nthese neurotransmitters.\nToday, we've been talking about\nhow these neurotransmitters\ncan be used to enhance the\nfunction of the immune system.\nAnd so just keep in mind that\nanytime you're talking about\nincreasing neurotransmitter levels,\nthat can be done pharmacologically\nthrough supplementation,\nor the can be done\nbehaviorally through exposure\nto cold water, for instance,\nor it can be done even\njust simply by breathing\nin a particular way,\ncyclic hyperventilation\nfollowed by retention.\nThe catacholamines,\nnoradrenaline, dopamine,\nand norepinephrine are\nthe bridge of activation\nfor the immune system\nand the nervous system.\nThey are the way that the\nnervous system calls out\nto the immune system,\n\"Aha, we have a problem.\nWe need to counter this.\"\nSo you can think of them,\nthem meaning dopamine,\nepinephrine, and norepinephrine,\nas being able to deploy larger\namounts of immune cells,\nall the types of immune\ncells that we talked about\nat the beginning of the episode.\nOkay, so thus far, we've been\ndiscussing how one can prevent\ngetting sick or when\none starts to feel ill,\nhow one might be able\nto shorten the course\nof that infection by\nramping up the activity\nof the immune system.\nBut what about when you're\nalready experiencing symptoms?\nThe runny nose, stuffed\nup nose, congestion,\nheadache, et cetera.\nWell, there are many ways to address that\nat the symptom level.\nYou're probably aware of all\nthe over the counter medications,\nmany of which focus on\nthe epinephrin system.\nThings that are of the\nSudafed variety prevent\nor reduce congestion because of the way\nthat they cause release of epinephrin,\nand some of the effects on\ndilating the bronchioles\nand dilating the nasal\npassages and so forth.\nI'm not going to speak to whether or not\nthose are good or bad choices.\nThey do have a couple of\neffects that are not so great\nfor the course of treating\nthe underlying cause,\nwhich are first of all\nthey can cause dehydration.\nSo you have to make sure\nthat you're hydrating well,\nboth fluids and electrolytes,\nand they also can interfere with sleep\nbecause as I've talked about\nin the episodes on sleep,\none of the hallmarks of\ndeep sleep and in particular\nREM sleep is that epinephrin,\nadrenaline levels are low.\nThis is what allows you to have intense,\noften very emotionally-laden\ndreams during REM sleep\nand not act those out.\nAnd low adrenaline,\nepinephrin during REM sleep\nis basically a signature,\na neurochemical signature\nof the REM sleep state,\nwhich is so vital for\nemotional and physical repair\nand so forth.\nSo, the fact that they can inhibit sleep,\nthe fact that can cause dehydration,\nthe fact that they can make\npeople feel kind of lightheaded\nand jittery makes them\nnot terrific choices\nfor a number of people.\nThere is an interesting\nalternative choice.\nAnd when I say alternative,\nI do mean alternative.\nThe choice that I'm\nreferring to is spirulina,\nwhich is actually a form of algae.\nYears ago, I think when I\nfirst heard about spirulina,\nit sounded very much of the kind of 1970s,\n80s health food store variety.\nIt seemed really kind\nof mystical and wacky,\nbut actually now there are\nsome really nice studies\nand some data, and also an\nunderstanding of the mechanism\nby which spirulina can have potent effects\nin reducing what's called rhinitis,\nwhich is a fancy word for\ncongestion of the nose\nand an inflammation of the nose.\nBasically, anytime you hear\na word that includes \"itis,\"\nat least if it's in the\nmedical or health context,\nit generally means\ninflammation of some tissue.\nSo rhinitis just being\ninflammation of the nasal passages,\nbut that's one of the most\nuncomfortable symptoms\nof any kind of infection.\nSo there are two studies\nI'd like to highlight\njust very quickly.\nOne is the effects of\nspirulina on allergic rhinitis.\nAnd the other is a clinical comparison\nto the efficacy of spirulina platensis,\nthat's a technical name,\nand cetirizine for the\ntreatment of allergic rhinitis.\nThese looked at humans, so\nthis is not a mouse study,\nthis is a study on humans.\nBoth sexes, so males and females.\nIn one case, looking at 100\nplus subjects, 129 subjects.\nThe other, 65 subjects, so\ndecent number of subjects,\nrandomized trial, double blind.\nBoth cases saw significant\ndecreases in nasal obstruction,\nimproved ability to smell, improved sleep,\ndaily working inflammatory\ncytokines were reduced as well,\nreduction in nasal itching,\nall the stuff that you'd\nlike to experience,\nI can imagine, after taking two grams,\ntwo grams, not milligrams,\nbut two grams of spirulina.\nSometimes had to be\ntaken for a short while\nbefore the effect kicked in.\nSo, that's pretty impressive, I would say,\nbut it doesn't really speak to mechanism,\nbut in exploring the underlying\nmechanisms for spirulina's\neffects on reducing rhinitis,\nit's interesting to find that\nspirulina actually can inhibit\nthe formation and/or activity of so-called\nhistaminergic mast cells,\nM-A-S-T, mast cells.\nWe haven't talked a lot about mast cells,\nbut they are a very interesting cell type\nin the immune response.\nEssentially what they are, are\nlittle packets of histamine.\nAnd when we have some sort\nof injury or irritant rather\nto the skin, so a mosquito\nbite, for instance,\nor poison oak or poison ivy,\nsomething that causes an itch\nor something that causes\ninflammation internally,\ndoesn't just have to be on the skin,\nthese mast are these little\nbubbles that contain histamine\nthat go to that site [hissing],\nand release their histaminergic contents\nand cause swelling and\ninflammation of whatever cells\nare affected locally.\nYou might think, well, why\nwould I want to have a mechanism\nin my body that would cause\nswelling and inflammation?\nAh, well then those cells in\nturn send out cytokine signals\nthat recruit the very cell\ntypes that we were talking about\nway back at the beginning of the episode,\nthe cells that are characteristics\nof the innate immune system that come in,\nthe macrophages and the\nother types of cells\nthat will come in and gobble\nup the foreign invaders\nor will help sequester and move away,\nsay the poison from a bite\nor from whatever irritant.\nAgain, it doesn't just have\nto be at the skin surface.\nI'm describing an example of\nat the skin, for instance,\nif you've ever had hives of any kind,\nthat almost certainly involved mast cells.\nSo, and when you take an\nanti-histamine in order to deal\nwith seasonal allergies, for instance,\nyou're taking a compound that's reducing\nhistamines in mast cells.\nAnd spirulina has also been\nused quite effectively as a way\nto treat seasonal allergies\nand some of the symptomatology.\nEqually on par with some\nof the major prescription\nand over the counter drugs for that.\nOne cautionary note, spirulina\ncan carry some side effects\nfor people that have a genetic mutation\nleading to something called PKU.\nThese people know who they are.\nThey're very sensitive to phenylalanine.\nThese same people cannot drink any sort\nof NutraSweet or diet soda for\nreasons that they understand.\nIt can be quite dangerous.\nIt's a rare genetic\ndisorder, but nonetheless,\nspirulina can be an\nissue for those people.\nFor most people, the side effect\nprofile is pretty minimal.\nAnd just to be clear, I\ndon't have any relationship\nto spirulina company or anything.\nI just find it interesting\nthat there are these compounds\nthat sound rather, forgive the phrase,\nbut rather new-agey because they come from\na algae, from a plant.\nBut when you look at the\nunderlying mechanism,\nit makes perfect sense.\nSo that's often what we\nlike to point out here\nis that if there are these\nso-called alternative therapies,\nalternative because most\npeople haven't heard of them,\nit's always nice if they map\nto a specific logical mechanism\nand framework by which\nthat compound would work,\nas opposed to just some anecdote of,\n\"Oh, I hear spirulina\nis great for allergies.\"\nWell, now we know why,\nit inhibits mast cells\nand histaminergic mast\ncells in particular.\nEarlier, I mentioned a new\nand very exciting study\npublished as a full article in \"Nature.\"\nFull article means that\nit is a major finding.\nAt the journal, \"Nature,\"\nthey have letters,\nwhich are important findings.\nThey're still very high\nstringency for getting\na letter in \"Nature\" published.\nBut the full articles, generally\nthere's only one or two\nper issue in the weekly\nedition of \"Nature.\"\nAnd just last week, there\nwas a very exciting article\npublished from Qiufu Ma's lab\nat Harvard Medical School.\nQiufu I've known for a number of years.\nHis group has done phenomenal\nwork on the mechanisms\nof itch and pain and discovering\nsome of the receptors\nand pathways for itch and pain.\nAnd more recently they've been exploring\nthe mechanistic basis of acupuncture.\nAnd the title of the article is,\n\"A neuroanatomical basis for\nelectroacupuncture to drive\nthe vagal adrenal axis.\"\nAnd while that's a mouthful,\nnow most all of you are probably\nfamiliar with what I mean\nwhen I say vagal adrenal axis;\nvagal meaning of the vagus,\nand adrenal of the adrenal glands.\nAnd so perhaps we should not be surprised,\nalthough excited, nonetheless,\nthat when Qiufu's lab looked\nat stimulation of the body\nwith so-called electroacupuncture.\nSo, these are needles where a small bit\nof electrical current, low\nlevel of electrical current,\nis passed into the needle\nand therefore into the body.\nThey located sites on the\nbody that can increase\ninflammation by way of releasing\ninflammatory cytokines.\nThese areas included the abdomen,\nand they found areas on the\nbody such as the lower limbs,\nor the hind limbs in this case,\nthat can stimulate the\nvagal adrenal reflex\nand can lead to reduced inflammation.\nAnd what was really interesting\nis that they figured out\nthat it was activation of nerve endings\nthat resided in the fascia.\nI mentioned earlier what fascia is,\nbut just to remind you,\nthe fascia is a really\nthick sheath of tissue\nthat surrounds muscle.\nIf ever you've heard of Rolfing,\nRolfing is a form of very intense massage.\nI've never had this done,\nbut I've heard about this.\nIt involves among other things,\nactually separating the muscle away\nfrom the fascia somewhat.\nSo it's a very, very deep tissue massage.\nActually a good friend\nof mine who had this done\ntold me that it was probably\nthe most challenging physical experience\nthat he had ever been\nthrough going through\nthis Rolfing procedure.\nMaybe some of you have have\nbeen Rolfed, as they say,\nand can report to the experience,\nwhether or not it was\npleasant or unpleasant,\nor you felt benefits or not.\nIn any case, this study\nisn't about Rolfing per se,\nbut it is about the fascia.\nAnd so what they discovered\nis there's a specific\npopulation of neurons.\nThose neurons have a name,\nas they often do in science.\nName isn't important, but\nif you want to look it up,\nit's the PROKR2 neurons,\nP-R-O-K R2 neurons.\nAnd they send a connection deep into\nthe limb fascial tissue, okay?\nAnd then they send another connection,\nthe connections we're\nreferring to are axons,\nneurons have axons.\nSo a wire in one direction that goes\ninto the deep fascial\ntissue of the lower limb,\nnear the calf and thigh.\nAnd then they send another\nwire up into the spinal cord,\ninto a region of the hind\nbrain in the back of your brain\nkind of near your neck\nin the medulla oblongata,\nthat neuron also has a name\ncalled the DMZ, doesn't matter.\nAnd that neuron connects\nto the adrenal gland\nto release our good old\nfriends, the catacholamines,\nnoradrenaline, adrenaline, and dopamine,\nor norepinephrine,\nepinephrin, and dopamine.\nAnd their release causes a\nreduction in inflammation,\neven in response to an\ninjection of something called\nlipopolysaccharide, which\ncan actually induce fever.\nSo, what does all this saying?\nThis is saying that activation\nof the deep fascial tissue\ncauses a chain of neural\nreactions that leads eventually\nto the release of\nnorepinephrine, noradrenaline,\nadrenaline, and dopamine.\nAnd once again, lowers inflammation,\nvery much like the breathing study\nthat we talked about\nearlier in the pattern\nof cyclical hyperventilation\nwith retention,\nleading to reductions in inflammation.\nI can't tell you how happy this makes me.\nI had nothing to do with this work,\nbut the reason it makes\nme happy is because\nI have a particular\nfondness for when practices\nthat have existed for many centuries\nor even thousands of\nyears, such as acupuncture,\nsuch as respiration work,\nstart to converge with some\nof the hardcore mechanistic science.\nAnd the reason this excites\nme is not because we want to\ntake science and erase the previous tools\nand methods of these ancient\npractices, not at all.\nAnd it certainly isn't\nthe case that we just want\nto name things or rename\nthings with modern science.\nWhat's very exciting is when\nwe can discover mechanism\nthat explains why certain practices work.\nFirst of all, that validates\nthose as legitimate practices,\nmaybe even insurance\nwill start to cover them,\nwhereas maybe they previously had not,\nI don't know what the current status\nis for insurance coverage of acupuncture.\nI'm guessing there are places that do it,\nmaybe others that don't.\nI personally am not somebody\nwho receives acupuncture.\nI have in the past, but it's\nnot that I'm in particular\na fan of it, but I think that\nthere are a number of people\nthat have benefited from it.\nSo, I think that's wonderful.\nBreath work and respiration\nwork is something\nthat I've cultivated as a\npractice over the years.\nI mentioned earlier, how\nI use it to push back\non incoming infections and so forth.\nAnd now that doesn't sound like total...\nYou know, like just a\nfigment of my imagination,\nthere's actually a mechanism,\na published mechanism to explain it.\nBut the most exciting\nthing to me about all this\nis that practices that\ntraditionally have been shrouded\nin complicated language\nor were the unique domain\nof the practitioners and relied on phrases\nlike the meridians or the chakras,\nof which I think is\nperfectly valid language,\nbut doesn't inform mechanism.\nAnd then in a separate community,\nthe community I come from,\nthe community of scientists,\nhave used language like PROKR2 neurons,\nmedulla oblongata, vagal adrenal axis.\nAnd basically no one can\ncommunicate with one another\nbecause the language is shrouding.\nWhat we're now starting to see\nis that at their convergence\nis a common mechanism.\nAnd with that understanding,\nwhat's going to be really terrific\nis as new protocols start to emerge.\nSo in understanding\nmechanisms and pathways,\nand in being able to understand\nthe base set of practices\nlike breathing, like\nelectroacupuncture, and so forth,\nwe can now start to daydream\nin a very realistic way\nabout the development of new protocols,\nmore effective protocols.\nProtocols that perhaps one can\ndo at home without needles,\nperhaps protocols such as the breathing\nthat you can do anywhere, anytime,\nand be confident that you're\nactually impacting the IL-6\nand the IL-8 pathways, reducing\nthose and increasing IL-10.\nSo we are no longer\nwandering around in the fog\nhearing about these magical\ntechniques without understanding\nwhy they work, nor are we\njust seeing a bunch of science\nthat is descriptive, but not mechanistic\nor pointing to specific protocols.\nSo, I'm just delighted.\nAgain, I had nothing to do with this work,\nbut really terrific work,\nQiufu and colleagues.\nAnd I also want to acknowledge a journal\nas prominent as \"Nature\"\nfor featuring this upfront,\nbecause I think it really\ndoes mark the beginning\nof a new path in medicine.\nAnd just to underscore that\npoint a little bit further,\nthe National Institutes of Health,\nof course has a cancer\ninstitute, an eye institute,\nthat deal with trying to combat cancer\nand to cure blindness and so forth.\nAnd now they have what's called NCCIH,\nwhich has complimentary health.\nAnd so, there are good\ntax dollars being put\nto the kinds of explorations\nthat we're talking about\nthat undoubtedly are going\nto lead to better treatments\nfor immunological diseases,\nneurological diseases,\nthe convergence of the immune\nsystem and the nervous system.\nVery exciting times and I\nhope that by learning about\nsome of this new and emerging\nscience and hearing about\nsome of the protocols that are\neither zero cost or low cost,\ncertainly for respiration that's the case\nor for the use of heat or cold,\nor maybe even electroacupuncture\nif you have access to that,\nthat we can really see that\nwe're starting to evolve\nas a field of health\nand medicine and science\nand ancient practices,\nand that they're really\nstarting to converge\nand have a vector, as we say,\nin a new and more exciting direction.\nOnce again, we've covered\na lot of information today.\nWe learned about the immune system,\nthe adaptive immune system,\nthe innate immune system,\nand the nervous system\nand how those interact.\nAnd throughout, we discussed\nprotocols that can allow you\nto tap into this relationship between\nthe nervous system and immune system,\nand hopefully avoid\nand/or shorten the course\nof any illnesses,\ninjuries, or inflammation\nthat you might encounter.\nIf you're enjoying and/or\nlearning from this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube channel.\nAnd also on YouTube,\nplease
