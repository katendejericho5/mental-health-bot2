    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science,\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, I have the pleasure of\nintroducing Dr. Samer Hattar\nas my guest on the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nDr. Hattar is the Chief of the Section\non Light and Circadian Rhythms\nat the National Institute of Mental Health\nin Bethesda, Maryland.\nDr. Hattar has many important\ndiscoveries to his name.\nHe was one of a handful\nof groups that discovered\nthe light sensing neurons in the eye\nthat set the circadian clock.\nThis is a fundamental discovery\nmade in the early 2000s\nthat has led to an enormous\nnumber of additional discoveries\non how light regulates our\nsleep, our immune system,\nour mood, mental health,\nmetabolism, feeding,\nand many other important processes.\nIf ever there was somebody who understands\nhow all of these processes interact\nand can inform best practices\nfor our daily behaviors,\nit's Dr. Hattar.\nDuring our discussion today,\nDr. Hattar answers questions\nthat are absolutely\nessential for us to know\nabout our health and wellbeing.\nFor instance, how to\nalign our sleep schedule\nwith our activity\nschedule, such as exercise,\nand how to align light,\nactivity and exercise\nwith our feeding rhythms.\nHe presents a new model\nof how light, activity,\nand feeding rhythms converge\nto support optimal health.\nAnd when those are not aligned correctly,\nhow our mental and\nphysical health can suffer.\nIt's a discussion that is rich\nwith scientific mechanism,\nmade clearly, of course, so\neverybody can understand,\nas well as specific\nprotocols to deal with shifts\nin day length, shifts in activity,\nand in order to optimize\nsleep, metabolism,\nand wellbeing of various kinds.\nI learned so much from\nSamer as I always do.\nHe is an absolute wealth of\nknowledge on all things related\nto light and circadian rhythms,\nphysiology, and neuroscience.\nI don't think you'll find anyone else\nas knowledgeable about\nthese topics as Samer.\nAnd so, I'm delighted that he\njoined us here on the podcast\nto share this information.\nBefore we begin I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent my career\nworking on the science\nof the visual system and I can tell you\nthat one of the things\nthat our visual system\nhas to contend with is\nadjusting so that when we go\nfrom a very bright area\nto a dim or shadowed area,\nwe can still see things clearly.\nROKA eyeglasses and\nsunglasses were designed\nwith the science of the\nvisual system in mind.\nAnd so they make those\ntransitions seamless.\nYou always see things\nwith crystal clarity.\nAnother great thing about these glasses\nis that they're very lightweight,\nso you don't even really remember\nthat they're on your face.\nAnd they won't slip off if you get sweaty.\nThe glasses were designed\ninitially for running\nand for cycling and for active wear,\nbut they work great for\nthat and they work great,\nand they also happen\nto look great for work,\nif you go out to dinner,\nfor social settings,\nso they can really be worn in\nessentially any circumstances.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com\nand enter the code\n\"Huberman\" to get 20% off\nyour first order.\nThat's ROKA.com, enter the\ncode \"Huberman\" at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be detected in\na quality blood test.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood tests out there, however,\nis you get numbers back, but\nyou don't know what to do\nabout those numbers specifically.\nROKA has solved that problem\nat a number of levels.\nFirst of all, they make getting\nthe blood tests very easy.\nThey'll come to your house if you like,\nor you can go to a local clinic.\nSecond of all, once you\nget your numbers back,\nthere's a very easy to use\ndashboard where you can identify\nobviously what the numbers are,\nbut also the various\nthings that you can do\nto bring those numbers into\nthe ranges that you want;\nthrough either behavioral\npractices like exercise,\nthrough nutritional practices\nor supplementation, et cetera.\nSo they made the whole thing\nvery easy start to finish,\nin a way that allows you to\nbest direct your health goals.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can visit InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans,\njust use the code \"Huberman\" at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Magic Spoon.\nMagic Spoon is a zero sugar, grain-free,\nketo-friendly cereal.\nI am not ketogenic,\nmeaning I don't follow\na purely ketogenic diet.\nI tend to fast in the\nearly part of the day,\nI tend to eat kind of low carbish\nthrough the middle of the day.\nAnd then in the evening\nI eat carbohydrates.\nThat's what works best for me,\nand allows me to feel alert all day long,\nand to sleep really well at night.\nMagic Spoon is a terrific snack for me\nbecause it tastes terrific;\nit's got some sweetness,\nbut it doesn't take me out of\nthat state that I want to be in\nduring the day where I'm\nsort of ketoish, I would say.\nI'm not actually in ketosis,\nbut I'm following more\nor less a low carb diet\nduring the day, which keeps me alert.\nSo either fasting or low carb,\nand Magic Spoon is consistent with that.\nAnd then as I mentioned\nbefore in the evening,\nI do eat carbohydrates.\nMagic Spoon has zero grams of sugar,\n13 to 14 grams of protein,\nand only four net grams of\ncarbohydrates in each serving.\nSo I think it qualifies as\nlow carbish or low carb.\nIn addition, it only has\n140 calories per serving.\nIt's also just delicious.\nThey have flavors like cocoa, fruity,\npeanut butter, frosted.\nI particularly liked the frosted one\nbecause it tastes like donuts,\nand I particularly like donuts.\nAlthough I try not to eat\nthem too often if ever.\nIf you want to try Magic Spoon,\nyou can go to MagicSpoon.com/Huberman\nto grab a variety pack.\nYou can use the promo code\n\"Huberman\" at checkout,\nand you'll get $5 off your

pleasure.\n- Yeah, we go way back.\nSo, you are best known\nin scientific circles\nfor your work on how light\nimpacts mood, learning, feeding,\nhunger, sleep, and these sorts of topics.\nSo, just to kick the ball out\nonto the field, so to speak,\nhow does light impact the way we feel?\nSo, when I get up in the morning,\nI have the opportunity\nto interact with light\nin certain ways or to avoid\nlight in certain ways.\nI have the opportunity\nto interact with sunlight\nor with artificial light.\nMaybe you could just wade us\ninto what the relationship is\nbetween light and these things\nlike mood and hunger, et cetera.\n- Sure.\nSo, I mean, you do appreciate the effect\nof light for vision.\nSo, when you wake up in a beautiful area,\nbeautiful ocean, light is essential;\nthe sunrise, the sunset, blue\nsky, beautiful mountains.\nSo, that's your conscious\nperception of light,\nbut light has a completely\ndifferent aspect\nthat is independent of conscious vision\nor image forming functions.\nAnd that's how it regulates many important\nfunctions in your body.\nI think the best that is\nwell studied and well known\nis your circadian clock.\nAnd the word circadian\ncomes from the word circa,\nwhich is approximate and diem is day.\nSo, it's an approximate day.\nWhy is it an approximate day?\nBecause if I put you or\nany other human being\nwho have a normal circadian\nclock in a constant conditions\nwith no information about\nfeeding time, about sleep time,\nabout what time it is outside,\nyou still have a daily rhythm,\nbut it's not exactly 24 hours.\nSo it will shift out of the solar day\nbecause it's not exactly 24 hours,\nand hence the name circadian.\n- So, just to ask a quick\nquestion about that.\nWhen you say you have\nthis about 24 hour rhythm,\nhow does that rhythm show up\nin the tissues of our body?\n- Great question.\nSo, it shows up at every\nlevel that we know we studied;\nit shows up at the level of the cell.\nIt shows up at the level of the tissue,\nand it shows up at your behavior.\nThe most obvious for you\nis your sleep-wake cycle.\nYou sleep and you're awake and\nsleep at the 24 hour rhythms.\nAnd if you measure the\nsleep-wake cycle of humans\nwho are maintaining constant conditions,\nyou will see that the period\nlength of the sleep rhythm\non average is more than 24 hours.\nIn humans it's 24.2 hours.\nSo you'll be drifting .2 hours every day\nout of the solar day if\nyou don't get the sunlight.\nSo the sunlight adjusts\nthat approximate day\nto an exact day, so now\nyour behavior is adjusted\nto the light-dark\nenvironment or the solar day.\n- Okay, so if I understand correctly,\nif I were to go into a cave-\n- Yeah.\n- Or I would to be\nin constant light.\n- Yeah.\n- And I didn't close my eyes-\n- Yeah.\n- In constant light,\nthat I would still sleep\nin one coherent about.\n- Yes.\n- And I would still be\nawake for more or less one\ncoherent about, maybe a nap.\n- Yes.\n- But the total duration\nof my day, so to speak,\nwould be a little bit\nlonger than 24 hours?\n- Perfect.\n- But if I'm in a condition\nlike most people are where the sun goes up\nand the sun goes down, and\nI have some understanding\nof that sunrise and sunset, then-\n- You don't have the understanding,\nyou don't have to have\nconscious understanding.\nYou have the detection.\n- Right.\n- So, circadian photoentrainment\nis the word we use,\nentraining the circadian clock\nto the photic environment\nis completely subconscious.\nYou're not aware of it.\nIt's not like vision or image forming,\nwhere you actually know\nwhat you're looking at.\nSo, it's all hypothalamic.\nIt's part of the brain that\nis not consciously driven.\nSo, you actually do not\nknow when it happens\nor when it doesn't happen.\nAnd that's what we'll\nget into when I tell you\nwhy light affects your mood\nand why sometimes people\ndon't know how to deal with light\nto improve their mood, for example.\n- Okay, so this is a subconscious vision.\n- Yes.\n- Okay.\nBefore you tell us about\nhow light impacts mood,\nI'm curious, what is the\nrelevance of adjusting this clock\nfrom a little bit longer\nthan 24 hours to 24 hours?\nI mean, it seems like a small difference,\n24 hours and 40 minutes or 24 hours.\nLike what's the relevance?\nI mean, why should we care\nabout that short difference?\n- So, let's do the math.\nIf you shift out .2 hours a day,\nin five days you're shifting out one hour.\nSo you're literally one hour off\nin your social behavior in five days.\nIn 10 days, you're two hours off.\nAnd if you're an organism\nthat is living in the wild,\nshifting out of the\nright phase of the cycle,\nyou could either miss food\nor you could become food.\nSo it's really essential for survival.\nI think it's one of the\nstrongest aspect of survival\nfor animals to have the anticipation\nand the adjustment to the solar cycle.\n- And for humans as well.\nWhen you say animals, I'm\nassuming that applies to us?\n- Absolutely, yeah.\n- I see.\nSo even though it's just a\nshort bit longer than 24,\nif that accumulates over days,\nthen you could find yourself\nvery much out of phase\nwith the rest of your species essentially.\n- Yeah, so let's say it's .2 hours.\nSo, in five days it's one hour.\nIn 25 days it could be five or six hours.\nYou could be in New\nYork and you're feeling\nas if you traveled from\nNew York to London.\nSo, you would be having\njet lag in New York,\neven though you didn't\ndo a jet lag travel.\nSo it's very important for the adjustment.\nAnd if we have time,\nmaybe we could talk about\nwhy this is important for seasonality,\nbecause also it allows\nanimals to anticipate\nthe change in season.\nAnd the more you're high\nin the north or the south,\nthe more that these weather\nchanges occur very harshly,\nand you have to be ready for them.\nAnd that happens in us as well.\n- All right, well, we will\ndefinitely get into seasonality.\nOkay, so we've got this\nsubconscious vision\nthat aligns us with the turn of the earth.\nHow does that work?\nWhat is the machinery that\nallows that to happen?\nAnd how does that machinery work?\n- Yeah, so, we knew that\nin mammals, including us,\nwe are mammals, humans,\nthat the eyes are required\nfor this function.\nSo, if humans are born without eyes,\nor the optic nerves are damaged,\nhumans are not able to\nadjust to the solar cycle.\nSo we know that the eyes are required.\nAnd since we thought we\nknew about the eyes a lot\nbefore 2000, we thought that-\n- You say before the year 2000?\n- Before the year 2000, yes.\n- Mm hm, yep.\n- We thought it's these\nphotoreceptors in your retina\nthat allow you to see.\nSo, in the human retinas,\nthere are two types of photoreceptors;\nthey are called rods and\ncones because of their shapes.\nAnd these rods and cones\nsimply take the photon energy,\nwhich light is made of,\nand they change it in a\nway to an electrical signal\nthat allow us to build the\nimage of the environment\nin our cortices.\n- Subconsciously?\n- Consciously in this situation\ncause it's vision, right?\nIt's image forming vision,\nit's a visual cortex,\nand associative cortices,\nwhich allow you to build\nconscious perception of the environment.\nHowever, people have found,\nincluding me with the work\nof David Berson and Ignacio Provencio,\nthat there is a subset of ganglion cells.\nThe ganglion cells are the\ncells that leave the retina,\ntheir axon leave the retina\nand project to the brain.\nSo these were thought to only\nrelay rod and cone information\nfrom the light environment to the brain.\nWe found that a small subset\nof these ganglion cells\nare themselves photoreceptors\nthat were completely\nmissed in the retina.\nAnd these are the photoreceptors\nthat relay light\nenvironment subconsciously\nto the areas in the\nbrain that have and house\nthe circadian clock or\nthe circadian pacemaker,\nwhich adjusts all the clocks in our bodies\nto the central brain clock\nthat allows them to entrain\nto the 24 hour light-dark cycle.\n- Incredible.\nSo, as I recall 'cause I was a\ngraduate student at the time,\nin the year 2000, there\nwas this landmark discovery\nmade by you, Ignacio Provencio,\nDavid Berson, and others,\nthat these cells exists\nthat can communicate\nday and night information to the brain.\n- Yeah.\n- In this very small\nsubset of cells.\nSince then, I've heard, but\nmaybe you can confirm or refute\nthat this system that connects the eyes\nto the rest of the brain\nis actually the most\nancient form of vision.\nThat this is probably the\nform of vision that some early\nversion of human beings had\nbefore they had pattern vision,\nbefore they could see colors and shapes\nand motion and all that.\nAnd that the same cells\nthat perform this role\nare actually similar to insect eyes.\nI think I heard David Berson\nsay once that we actually\nhave a little bit of\nthe fly eye in our eye.\nWhat's he talking about?\n- Yeah.\nSo, it's really interesting actually,\nbecause these same ipRCGs we\ndiscovered they contribute\na little bit to image formation.\nAnd now, work from Tiffany\nSchmidt specifically have proven\nthat they do contribute to\nimage forming functions.\nBut they contribute to very limited\naspect of image formation.\nSo, it fits your hypothesis that these\nare an ancient photoreceptors.\nThe other thing that\nadds to that hypothesis\nis that they are expressed\nin cells that don't have\nany modification that make\nthem look like photoreceptors.\nSo, the photoreceptors\nthat I told you about\nthat are important for\nvision, image formation,\nthey have very specialized\nstructures that allow them\nto pack these structures\nwith photopigments;\nthese are the photo-detecting proteins,\nso they could detect a\nhigh sensitivity of photons\nthat pass through them.\nThese new photoreceptors don't have\nthese specialized structures.\nSo they just really need a\nlot of light at the time,\nwe thought they need a lot\nof light to be activated.\nSo that's why we think they are ancient.\nAnd that's why we think they\nadjust to ancient functions\nthat are as important as regulating\nyour body circadian clock\nto the solar environment,\nto solar day or to the light-dark cycle.\n- So, you mentioned ipRCGs,\nintrinsically photosensitive.\nSo these are cells that\nconnect the eye of the brain\nthat behave like photoreceptors.\n- Right.\n- Essentially.\nAnd then you mentioned melanopsin,\nwhich is the actual pigment\nthat converts the light\ninto the electrical signal-\n- Yeah.\n- More or less.\nAnd my understanding is that\nmelanopsin was identified first\nin frog melanophores.\n- Yes.\n- So does that mean that\nwe have like little pieces\nof frog skin in our eyes?\n- So, honestly, David Berson\nsay you have a fly in your eye\nbecause it sounds better.\nThe more accurate I think is that you have\na frog skin in your eye.\nIt's not as catchy, but really,\nthe name melanopsin is\nfrom melanocyte opsin,\nso it's melanopsin because it was found\nin the frog melanocytes.\nYou know the frogs can change\ntheir color depending on light\nand melanopsin drives this response.\nSo when Ignacio Provencio first discovered\nthese opsins in frogs,\nluckily he was smart enough\nto see if they are expressed\nin the frog eye.\nThey were expressed in the\nfrog eye and it what appears\nto be retinal ganglion\ncells, which I told you,\nthe one that connects\nthe eye to the brain.\nHe had the insight to go and see\nif they are expressed in the monkey eye.\nAnd he found that they are\nalso expressed in what appears\nto be retinal ganglion cells,\nand really that what\nopened the field wide open.\nThen David Berson did\nthe seminal experiment\nwhere he went to the brain\nwhere the central oscillator,\nthe oscillator that drives\ncircadian rhythm in the brain\ncalled the suprachiasmatic nucleus,\nthat has been known for many\nyears to receive retinal input.\nAnd he labeled the cells\nthat project there.\nAnd then he found that even\nif you destroy rods and cones,\nyou could get light\nresponses from these cells.\nSo you could imagine he\nnearly fainted when he saw\nthat these cells can respond independent,\ncompletely in the absence\nof rod and cone input.\n- Yeah, I'll never forget reading\nthose papers in 2000, 2001.\nI was at the meeting in DC when Ignacio,\nIggy, we call him Iggy,\nshowed this image of this basically\nwhat is frog melanophores\nin the human eye.\n- Yes.\n- [Andrew] And everyone was like,\n\"oh my goodness, this is the thing.\"\n- Yeah.\n- And I want to get into how light\nactually can control circadian rhythms.\nIn a moment.\n- Absolutely.\n- But I think it's worth\nmentioning now that people\nwho are pattern vision blind,\nso people who cannot see\nand no conscious vision,\nbut have eyes, many of them\nstill have these cells;\nthese melanopsin intrinsically\nphotosensitive cells,\nand can essentially match\nor entrain, as we say,\nonto the light-dark cycle.\n- In fact, they possibly have no problems\nin circadian photoentrainment,\nthey'll have a normal sleep-wake cycle.\n- But they're totally blind?\n- But they are totally image blind.\nAnd what's really interesting is that,\nand this story I heard\nfrom Chuck Czeisler,\nso I'll give him credit,\nthat some of these people\nwho are image blind,\nusually they get dry eyes and\nthey give them a lot of pain.\nAnd doctors used to think,\noh, since they are image blind\nand they're getting dry eye,\nwhy don't you just remove their eyes?\nThey're not using them anymore.\nAnd the minute they\nwould remove their eyes,\nthey start having cyclical\nsleep problems indicating\nthat now they are not entraining\nto the light-dark cycle\nand are having cyclical jet\nlags when their clock shifts\nthrough the light-dark cycle.\n- That's really interesting.\nAnd I hear from a number of blind people\nin my various aspects of my job,\nand a lot of them have issues with sleep.\nI think, in part because they\ndon't realize that they too\nneed to see light at particular\ntimes of day or night\nin order to match their schedule.\n- Absolutely.\n- Well, I think\nthat's a perfect segue for\nus to talk about how light\nand viewing light can impact\nour sleep-wake rhythms.\nAnd then we'll move into some\nof the other ways in which\nlight can impact other\nforms of bodily function.\n- Yeah, so I love the way you set it up\nbecause one of the most\ninteresting and difficult aspect\nof trying to educate\npeople about light effect\non subconscious vision is\nthat it's subconscious.\nSo we're all aware of\nwhat we think is intensity\nbecause we see the room,\nbut if you talk to people\nwho know how to take\nphotographs and stuff like that,\nthey know that the\nintensities varies greatly.\nBut our system, because we\nhave to see the same way\nin very bright conditions\nand very dim conditions,\nwe're not very good at\nestimating intensity consciously.\nSo when you try to tell\npeople about intensity,\nyou really struggle because\nthey think they know intensity,\nbut they really don't.\n- You mean light intensity?\n- Light intensity.\n- Yeah.\n- So the cones themselves\nhave an incredible ability to adapt\nto different light conditions.\nSo you can see at all\ndifferent conditions.\nOtherwise it'd be a disaster.\nIf you don't change the\nsetting on your camera\nand you go from inside\nthe room to the outside,\nit becomes completely white,\nyou don't see anything.\nSo if your cones don't\nadapt to the environment,\nthen you're not going to\nbe able to see in this room\nand on the beach, right?\nBut the problem is your ipRCGs,\nthe cells that we talked about,\nthey measure intensity pretty well.\nThey really know what intensity is.\nThey have a very good linear\nmeasurement of intensity.\nThey don't adapt as well.\nThey don't adapt actually\nthat much, to be honest.\nSo that tells you that\nsubconsciously the system is used\nto measuring light intensity\nin a natural environment,\nbecause when you are now\nin the natural environment,\nyou don't have industrialized lighting,\nthen your system is functioning very well.\nBut now when we change these environments,\nwe could really mess up ourselves.\nSo you have to teach people\nhow to understand intensity.\nAnd that's something that you\nhave to explain to people.\nAnd I think I love to do it myself.\nI do it in what is called\nthe lowest amount of light\nrequired to allow you to see comfortably.\nSo you have to do this\nas an fun experiment.\n- Okay, so explain to me how this goes.\nAnd maybe we could break up the day\ninto three or four parts.\nSo let's say assuming\nthat most people wake up\nin the morning-\n- Mm hm.\n- As opposed to night\nshift workers, et cetera,\nwe could talk about later.\n- Right.\n- But they wake up in the morning,\nso let's divide the day into quarters.\nWhat is the proper way\nto interact with light\nin the first part of the day?\n- So, I honestly think the\neasiest thing is waking up,\nget as much light as you can.\n- To your eyes?\n- Yeah, it's really nice.\nYour system is prime.\nIf you're entrained,\nit's prime to get light,\nthe sun should be out.\nMost animals in the wild,\nthey actually seem to track the sun.\nThe sun has a huge\ninfluence on life on earth.\nIt's actually life on\nearth is because of sun.\nSo, that's easy.\nIn the morning when you\nwake up, you need light.\nJust get the light.\n- Okay, so what is\nthe behavioral practice\nthat you recommend?\nLet's say somebody is in a condition where\nthere's a lot of cloud cover.\n- Yeah.\n- Is it important to get outside?\n- So, I have to tell you,\nthe cloudiest day is going\nto be much more brighter\nthan your room.\nYou could ask any photographer.\nA cloudy day, unless it's\nreally dark, dark clouds,\nusually cloudy days have\nmuch more light outside\nthan inside the room,\neven when you have good\nlighting inside the room.\nSo I think in the outside is\nusually even when it's cloudy,\nyou're going to get to enough\nintensity to help you adjust\nyour cycle to the day-night cycle.\n- So, how long do you...\nThese are general rules of thumb,\nbut how long do you\nrecommend people go outside?\n- So, if you do it daily,\nyou possibly need very few.\nIf you do it daily,\nbecause remember this thing\nis going to happen on a daily matter.\nSo, let's say 15 minutes.\n- So, the clock is tracking\nit on a regular basis?\n- Absolutely.\nIt's photon counting, it's tracking.\nI would say 15 minutes.\nIf you don't do it daily,\nyou may want to increase it.\nAnd we'll talk about when you\ntravel, what you could do,\nbut yeah, 15 minutes should be fine.\nYou do it more, it doesn't hurt.\n- And through a window,\nmy understanding is that through a window,\nit dramatically decreases\nthe amount of light energy\ncoming in.\n- It depends on how thick\nthe windows are and how dark they are.\nSo, but it's also nice to go outside\nand to feel the seasons.\n- Sunglasses off?\n- I don't use sunglasses.\n- Yeah, but you have your\nJordanian photopigment.\n- Yeah, yeah, that's right.\n- You know, so, yeah.\nWhereas my eyes are very sensitive, right?\n- No, but I personally,\nif I'm in the shade\nor if it's not incredibly bright,\nI try to, especially in the morning,\nbut I'm also an early person.\nSo we have to differentiate between early-\n- What time do you wake up?\n- I wake up at 4:30 in the morning.\n- But the sun isn't out yet.\n- It's not out yet, so it's-\n- So, what do you do?\nYou turn on artificial lights?\n- I usually don't turn on artificial light\nbecause I know the sun is\ngoing to come up eventually,\nbut that's why I don't like the change\nin the timing that they do.\n- Wait, but what do you do\nbetween 4:30 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.?\n- I mean, I look at my computer,\nand my phone.\n- Oh, I see.\n- So possibly I get enough light,\nbut in reality, I mean as\nlong as you let your body\nget the morning sunlight,\nwhich I think is really,\nto me and there is no evidence of this,\nbut to me, if you look\nat all animals, plants,\nthis morning sunlight\nseems to be very important.\nAnd we don't have experiments to show it,\nbut I have a gut feeling that it\nhas a huge impact on humans.\n- Well, Jamie Zeitzer's lab\nat the Stanford Sleep Lab\nhas shown that these early\nmorning light flashes\ncan adjust the total amount of sleep-\n- Absolutely.\n- That one will get.\nIt makes it easier to get into sleep.\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\nAnd Ken Wright also did this\nbeautiful camping experiments\nthat showed that-\n- Maybe you could describe\nthose 'cause those are\nbeautiful experiments.\n- Oh, yeah, they are\nbeautiful experiments.\nHe took these college\nstudents that had a late onset\nof sleep and late waking time,\nand then he said, let's go\ncamping and just don't use\nany artificial light and\nyou could go to sleep\nas late or as early as you want,\nand wake up as late or as early.\nAnd he found a huge shift\nin their sleep pattern\njust by exposing them\nto the light-dark cycle.\nI mean, so-\n- And it has lasted.\n- And it lasted, yeah.\n- Even after they came back.\n- Exactly.\n- Those two days of camping\nreset the circadian clock?\n- Seven days, but it lasted.\nYeah, it's pretty amazing.\nYeah, it's really incredible.\n- Okay, so get bright light\nof some sort early in the day,\nideally sunlight, even on a\ncloudy day, it's going to be-\n- Absolutely.\n- Brighter than indoor light.\n- So that's easy.\n- Okay, so then-\n- And the other thing that\nI would like to mention\nto people, if you think\nit's very dim outside,\nlet's say it's very cloudy, stay longer.\nSo remember intensity\nis only one component.\nDuration is also\nimportant because remember\nthat the circadian system is\nnot like the image system.\nIn the image system you\nhave to change every second\nbecause you're looking\nat different objects.\nYou have to change your perception.\nBut for the circadian system\nit's trying to figure out\nwhere am I in the day-night cycle?\nSo the more you give them the information,\nthe better you are.\nSo, if it's very bright,\nyou don't need a lot\nbecause it's clearly going\nto make you fire like crazy.\nBut if it's not bright, stay\nlonger, stay for one hour.\nYou know, have your coffee\noutside or something like that.\nIt's just going to help.\n- I think you said something\nextremely important,\nwhich is that this circadian\nsystem is trying to figure out\nwhen you are in time.\n- Exactly.\n- Not where you are in space.\n- Sorry, I said, where you are in time.\n- Yeah.\n- I mean when you are.\n- Oh no, no, I wasn't correcting you.\nI just meant that I think\nfundamentally that's\nthe incredible thing about this system.\n- Absolutely.\n- That you have this clock,\nthis 24 hour clock in your brain,\nbut it needs to be\nsynchronized to the outside.\nSo could we go a little deeper\ninto this circadian setting\nbehavior and come up with\nsome general rules of thumb?\nSo, let's say it's a very bright day.\n- Mm hm, mm hm.\n- Extremely bright.\nNo clouds, the sun's out.\nYou said 10 minutes, 15 minutes.\n- And I'll tell you if you're sensitive,\nyou don't even have to go in the sun.\nYou could be in the shade.\nThere's going to be so many\nphotons out there in the shade.\nIt's going to be perfect.\nYou don't even have to see the sun.\nYou don't have to have the sun.\nYou know, it's great for vitamin D,\nthat's a different story.\nYou could do this for your\nskin and protect your skin.\nThat's not my area of expertise,\nbut for that effect on\nthe circadian system,\nas long as you're outside in\nthe shade and it's sunny day,\n10 to 15 minutes should be ample amount.\n- Okay and then let's say\nit's kind of overcast.\nYou know, it's not particularly bright\nor there's solid cloud cover,\nbut obviously the sun is out,\nbut it's not as bright.\nHow long do you think it\nwould take to set the clock?\n- 10 to 15 should be sufficient.\nStay for half an hour.\nStay for 45 minutes.\nIf it's very darker out, stay for longer.\n- Okay and if for some reason,\none finds themselves very far north,\nand it's very, very dense a cloud cover.\nHow long and at what point\nshould somebody consider\nusing an artificial light\nsource to mimic the sunlight?\n- Yeah, honestly, this\nis where we don't have\na lot of information still,\nbecause this is where\nwe're going to discuss\nthis maybe in more detail,\nthat if you put humans\nin artificial conditions,\nthe circadian system is\nvery sensitive to light,\nbut in reality, in the real environment,\nlight also is affecting other\naspects that are independent\nof the setting of the circadian pacemaker.\n- Okay.\n- And these which we call\nthe direct effect of light\non mood, for example.\nSo, that is very hard to figure out\nwhat intensity you need to use.\nAnd we haven't done enough experiments\n'cause this system has been\ndiscovered just recently.\nBut I would say if you use\nbright light in the morning,\nand I mean, it's hard\nfor me to give numbers.\nIt can get complicated.\nBut yeah, I mean, honestly,\nif you're that far north\nand you're in the winter\nand you make sure you don't,\nuse these light boxes.\nI would suggest that\npersonally, but that's it.\n- I use, it's actually not\ndesigned for circadian setting,\nbut I have a 930 lux\nlight pad that I bought\nand I bought it, they're\nvery affordable compared\nto the dawn simulating lights.\n- Yeah, you don't need them.\n- Which are quite expensive, frankly.\n- Yeah.\n- And I put it there.\nAnd so, just basically, when\nI wake up in the morning,\nI use that until the sun comes out,\nand then I make sure once\nthe sun is out, I go outside.\nBut I keep that thing on all day.\nAnd I don't know if that's good or bad.\nIs a good or bad?\n- I, honestly, I don't think\nbeing exposed to bright light\nin the day is going to\never be bad because really\nif you're outside in the day...\nUnless, you know, the worst\nthat's going to happen\nif the temperature is very high,\nyour body's going to say don't\ndehydrate and go to sleep.\nSo you could tell actually\nsometimes when it's very hot,\nthe more you get exposed to bright light,\nthe sleepier you feel in the afternoon,\nwhich is counter-intuitive.\n- Mm hm.\nAnd that's to protect us, you\nthink, against dehydration?\n- I think if you think\nabout the human evolution\nfrom near the equator in between noon\nand a certain time in the afternoon,\nit would have been very\nhard for you to maintain\nphysiological homeostatic function,\nbeing active at this very\nhigh temperature time.\nSo I think napping was a way,\nthat's why I think it has a\nmajor function which is still...\nNapping was a way to somehow take you away\nfrom that dangerous zone.\nAnd maybe that's why people\nin the north they say,\nin the winter we can't\nwake up in the morning\n'cause they don't have this long light.\nSo, they sleep more at night.\nBut in the summer they say,\nwe feel like we can't go to sleep.\nWe have to put all these dark curtains.\nSo, I think, venturing that\nmuch up north has been...\nCame up with a problem\nbecause evolution was used to\na certain light environment\nthat was completely\nchanged with a human.\nWith other animals, I think\nthat lived there longer,\nthey have come up with\nvery interesting adaptation\nof actually measuring\neven very small changes\nin the light intensities that still occur.\nAnd so, even if you're near the poles,\neven though it's always light,\nbut there is a change\nin the light intensity\nacross the day-night cycle.\nSo, your system, if it's linear,\nand remember I told you that\nipRCGs are incredibly linear,\ncan still measure, oh, this is\nlower light than higher light\nif the organism has\nthe ability to do that.\n- I see, yeah, it's interesting.\nI've spent so much time learning from you\nfortunately about these cells,\nand yet I never really\nappreciated until now\nhow on the one hand they are\ntracking the amount of light\nto understand when we are in time\nrelative to the 24 hour cycle,\nbut also that you keep mentioning this\nlinear measurement of intensity;\nthat they really are trying to figure out\nwhen we are in time by measuring\nthe intensity of light.\nAnd of course the sun is\nthe most intense source\nof light available to us.\nSo, okay, so I think we've nailed down\nthat first part of the day.\n- Exactly.\n- Basically it's get 10 to 30 minutes\ndepending on how bright it is,\nand try and do that as often\nas possible to give the system\na regular source-\n- Daily is the best.\nThis system is really about,\nand you'll see that even for\nthe effect on depression,\nit's about multiple days it is.\nSo you don't have to worry\nif you missed it one day,\nstay longer if you want.\nBut if you're in a hurry and\nyou want to do other stuff,\nthat's a great recommendation.\n- Mm hm, so you might want to\ncompensate with some extra time\nif you missed a day or two.\n- Absolutely.\n- And this is why I've\nheard you say before,\nit's entirely possible to\nget severely jet lagged\nwithout traveling.\n- Absolutely.\n- Simply by staying in,\nbeing on your phone too much,\nnot getting the sunlight.\n- Absolutely.\nAnd you saw this during the pandemic.\nA lot of people mentioned that their\nsleep-wake cycles suffered a lot.\nBecause if you're not going\nout and if you're staying\nat home and you don't have big windows\nand you're waking late, waking up late,\nand then you're using very\nbright light too late at night,\nyour body is going to shift.\nAnd now, your day is going\nto start instead of like\nreally when the sun comes up,\nlet's say at six o'clock in the morning,\nso your day is going to start\nat 11 o'clock in the morning.\nThat's what your body's going to think\nis the beginning of the day.\nSo, then you're not\ngoing to be able to sleep\nat 10 o'clock at night,\nbecause now that's really for your body,\nit's completely different timing.\nAnd you could see this\nhappen during the pandemic\nat a very high scale.\nPeople get delayed in their\nsleep-wake cycle a lot.\n- And there is this idea of chronotypes,\nthat we all each intrinsically\nhave a best rhythm\nof either being a morning person.\n- Absolutely.\n- You called yourself\nan early person, or a night owl,\nor more of a kind of\nstandard to bed around 10:30,\nup around 7:00 type thing.\nAnd I think there are now good data,\ncorrect me if I'm wrong,\nfrom the National Institutes\nof Mental Health and elsewhere\nshowing that the more we deviate\nfrom that intrinsic rhythm,\nthe more mental health issues\nand physical health\nissues start to crop up.\n- So, there is great data on this,\nand there is a couple of\nthings that complicate this.\nThe first is the people\nwho usually are late,\nthey tell you that the\nsociety doesn't accommodate.\n- By late, what do you mean?\nPeople that wake up late\nand go to sleep late?\n- Go to sleep late and wake up late.\nThey have an overwhelmingly higher level\nof depression and failures.\nI mean, clearly, I mean,\nthe reason the people say\nsleep early, wake up early,\nyou're better because\nhuman notice that people\nwho go to sleep early and wake up early,\nthey do better in life.\nThey notice that.\n- They just perform better?\n- They perform, but the question is,\nis that intrinsic to the\nsystem or is that society\nbecause society start things\nusually early or late?\nThat's a hard question to ask-\n- We discriminate against late risers.\n- In a way, we discriminate, right?\nBut the other explanation\nis Ken Wright's experiment.\nThese late riser, if they were\ntruly chronotypically late,\nwhy would they shift so easily\nwhen you put them in the...\nIf you were really chronotypically late,\nand there is a phase relation between\nthe light-dark environment\nand your circadian clock,\nthen doing this camping\nexperiment should not have caused\nmuch changes because it's not\nthat light is going to affect you\nin a certain way, it's that\nthis is the relationship\nthat your body decided that I'm\na late sleeper, late waking.\nSo, I'm honestly, I'm\nstill unable to figure out\nhow much of this late\nwaking up is controlled\nby the light environment\nand how much is intrinsic.\nI'm sure there are differences,\nbut are they as big as we\nsee in the environment?\nBecause you have people that\ngo off to sleep a 7:00 p.m.\nand wake up at 1:00 a.m..\nThese are clearly advanced phase-\n- So people that go to sleep at 7:00 p.m.\nand wake up at 1:00 a.m.?\n- Yeah.\n- And feel good doing that?\n- I'm not so sure they feel good,\nbut a lot of the time you talk to people,\nthey say they are high achievers,\nbut they suffer because\nthey go to 7:00 p.m.,\nwake up advanced phase sleep syndrome.\nThey call it a syndrome,\nbut then you have people\nwho would not be able\nto sleep till 5:00 a.m.,\nand not be able to wake\nup till 3:00 p.m., right?\nAnd I'm not so sure that\nthe circadian system\nis that variable in the human population.\nI mean, clearly there are\nmaybe some genetic factors\nthat make a small percentage\nof like everything\nwith the bell shape.\nBut I think most of the time,\nthe light environment may play a role.\nAnd once, as we've talked about,\nthis as a long-term effect of light.\nOnce you get into a rhythm,\nand I don't mean it as a pun,\nin reality, once you get into a rhythm,\nit's hard to break out of that\nrhythm because if you start\nsleeping late and waking up late,\nyou're not getting the morning sunlight.\n- Right.\n- And so,\nyou're just going to be late.\nAnd if you're like me waking up early,\nyou're getting the morning sunlight.\nYou're getting what Zeitzer said...\nI said his last name wrong.\nThe one in Stanford who did the-\n- Oh, Jamie Zeitzer, yeah.\n- Zeitzer, yeah.\n- [Andrew] He actually worked for-\n- Zeitzer, yeah.\n- Zeitzer.\nSo, Zeitzer and Czeisler.\n- Yeah, it's confusing.\n- Yeah, there are a lot of\nzz's and i's in their names.\n- Yeah.\n- Both phenomenal scientists.\n- Yeah.\n- What it seems to me\nis the case is that the\nonly way to really know\nif you're meant to be an\nearly bird as they call it,\nan early person or a late person,\nor somewhere in between is\nto get morning sunlight,\nand figure out whether or not\nthat makes you feel better.\n- And to understand,\nto be educated about how\nto measure intensity.\n\"How to measure\" I put in quotation\n'cause you either get a measuring device,\nbut you cannot depend on your\neye to measure intensity.\n- Okay, so how do we do that?\n'Cause you keep coming back to this.\nSo, that tells me that it's important.\n- It's very important.\n- So, obviously,\nso there are apps, free\napps like Light Meter,\nwhere you can walk around\nand hold the button down\nand see how many lux\nare in the environment.\n- These are complicated\nbecause you have to point them\nto specific regions.\n- Right.\nSo, how do people start to\ndevelop an intuitive sense\nof the measurement of intensity?\n- Yeah, I think at one\npoint I posted on Instagram,\nhow I keep my nighttime at home.\nAnd I found out that my\nnight vision is very strong.\nSo I found out that I,\nespecially in the winter,\nI only need candle lights.\nSo I literally use these tea lights,\nand I put like 15 or 20 of them-\n- How romantic.\n- And it's so nice.\nI could see it clearly doesn't\naffect my circadian system.\n- You and your cats-\n- And my wife.\n- And your wife of course.\n- It's just great, right?\nBut I don't expect people to have\nthe same night vision as me.\nSo, I mean, I tell\npeople, do the experiment.\nSo if you put three or\nfour lights in your room,\nswitch two, sit for 15 minutes.\n- Switch two off?\n- Switch two off.\nLet's say you're using five.\nAnd see, after 15 minutes,\nyou will not recognize you\nswitched these two off.\nMy gut feeling is that\nmost people would need\nat least 10 times less light\nthan they use at night to see.\nThe problem people use it\nbecause most of the time they didn't\nsee the morning sunlight.\nThey are actually hungry for\nlight without their knowledge.\nSo they come switch all these lights on,\nbut at the wrong time.\nBecause they woke up late.\n- Okay, now I understand.\nSo, this morning light\nviewing goes way beyond-\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\n- Setting your clock.\nIt's also a way to\ndetermine how little light\nyou need later in the day.\n- Exactly.\n- And we're going to talk\nabout this in a moment,\nbut how little light\nyou get later in the day\nis a very strong\ndeterminant of things like\nwhen you will wake up,\nwhether or not you wake up\nfeeling refreshed, et cetera.\nLet's move-\n- And that's why,\n- Yeah?\n- I'm going to break it\non your show, Andrew, that\nI'm going to tell you,\nI think there is\nsomething else that people\ndo need to think about, which\nis the tripartite model.\nThat this model incorporate\nthree components\nwe should talk about in\ndetails that allows us humans\nand all animals to incorporate\nthe circadian clock,\nand its relation to light,\nthe homeostatic drive,\nand the direct effect of the environment,\nwhich includes stress,\nlight, all kinds of stuff.\nThey have to be incorporated together.\nIf you think, that's\nwhat I think right now,\nif you think of one alone, you\nwill always miss something.\nAnd when you think of them as a whole,\nthings really become clear.\nIt's actually quite amazing.\n- Okay, well, we will\ndefinitely want to hear\nabout your tripartite\ntheory and go into detail\nabout those homeostatic mechanisms.\nI want to make sure that for\npeople who are thinking now,\nI'm sure about light\nand how it impacts them.\nSo the morning light viewing behavior,\nI like to think we've tacked down clearly.\n- Absolutely.\n- And thank you for that\nbecause there's so much\ninformation out there\nand I've tried to relay that information.\nOf course, you're my primary source\nfor all things circadian,\nas well as Jamie and others,\nof course, and Matt Walker.\nBut I think you've made\nthat very, very clear.\nNow, let's say I've gotten\nmy morning sunlight.\nOkay, great.\nMaybe my bright artificial light,\nand throughout the day you\nsaid to get a lot of light.\nSo, I'm working at my desk.\nMaybe I'll go out during\nthe day a few times,\nbut I'm working at my\ncomputer, I'm doing things.\nIs there anything about light viewing\nin the middle of the day that\npeople should keep in mind?\nOr can they just sort of freestyle it\ndepending on what they're doing?\nMost people are not in a\ndark room throughout the day-\n- Yeah, so my gut feeling,\nif you've got your morning sunlight,\nyou walk from your car\nslowly or you walk to work,\nyou didn't wear sunglasses when the lights\nwere still dim in the morning,\nthat you could freestyle it.\nThat even if you don't get a lot of light,\nthere is a way to just...\nIn the day, you don't\nhave to just worry about\ngetting a lot of bright light,\nbut personally, I like to do that.\nSo I go out at lunch and have\nmy lunch outside as well.\nThis reminds the body that\nhere it is even brighter now.\nBut the evidence is\nthat you could literally\nhelp your circadian clock by\ngiving lights at dawn and dusk.\nBut again, if you think\nof the tripartite model,\nthis may be important\nfor the circadian clock,\nbut is it important for your mood?\nSo that's where I think you\nneed, or the homeostatic drive.\nSo that's where you\nneed to think about it.\nSo, for the clock, for\nentraining your clock,\nyou literally can entrain it\nonly by the dawn sunlight.\nYou actually don't need dawn and dusk.\nPeople usually forget that.\n- Yeah and I appreciate\nthat you're distinguishing\nbetween circadian effects\nand other effects of lights.\n- Yes.\n- You're being very precise,\nwhich is appreciated.\nUntil we hear about this tripartite model,\nwhich we will cover, for\nthe sake of the discussion,\nlet's treat the light viewing behavior\nas what are the benefits or\ndrawbacks of viewing light\nfor all biological purposes,\nnot just circadian settings?\nSo, in the morning, it's\nclearly going to set the clock.\nAnd then, during the day,\nif I understand correctly,\nthe idea is to get as much\nbright light as you can,\nbecause you're feeding,\nit sounds like a sort of\nlight hunger.\n- Exactly.\n- I see.\n- I love this way to put it.\nI think there is a weird light hunger\nconsidering that we're not\nphotosynthetic organisms.\nThere is a weird light hungers in animals\nthat they need measure.\nAnd I think that relates to the season\nbecause the whole\nreproduction cycle of animals\nis going to depend on the availability\nof food in the environment.\nAnd if you don't know when\nthe season is going to happen,\nthey don't have calendars,\nit's going to be very hard to survive.\nSo I think that's why we\nhave this light hunger.\nThat's a major hypothesis.\nIt's not been tested.\n- Interesting.\nSo, then afternoon and\nevening start to approach.\nSo, I've had this weird experience.\nMaybe you can psychologically\nor biologically\ndiagnosed me now, Samer.\nSo, where if I go into a\nmovie in the afternoon,\nlike a matinee.\n- Uh huh.\n- And I come out and it's dark,\nI notice a significant drop in my mood\nand my ability to go to sleep.\nWhereas if I get some view\nof the light in the evening,\nit doesn't have to be the sunset,\nalthough sunsets are nice,\nbut I get some light\npulse in the afternoon\nthat I have no trouble\nwhatsoever falling asleep.\n- And this happens on a\nsingle time to watch them?\n- Yeah, more or less.\n- Wow, that's interesting.\n- And then you mentioned\nthe camping experiment\nwhere when they went camping,\nthey're seeing the sunrise and the sunset.\n- [Samer] Mm hm, mm hm.\n- So what should people\ndo in the afternoon\nslash evening time in terms of\ntheir light viewing behavior?\n- I mean, the best thing to do is to let\nthe natural light creep\ninto darkness, right?\nThat would be the best,\nbut clearly that would be inefficient.\nYou want to go home, you want to read,\nyou want to talk to your kids,\nyou want to talk to your family.\nSo, I think it's nice to extend the day.\nI don't think that's wrong.\nIf you somehow can block that light\nfrom affecting your circadian clock.\n- So, should people use blue\nblockers in the evening?\n- I personally do not like any blockers\nthat take a single wavelength of light.\nBecause again, if you think\nof a holistic approach,\nyes, the blue blocker\nis going to prevent you\nfrom affecting your\ncircadian clock very much.\nBut then your vision is\ngoing to be distorted\nbecause we always see in full spectrum,\nthe sun has this\nbeautiful spectrum, right?\nAnd then when you start\nseeing without the blue,\nthings look yellow and it\ncan get really weird, right?\nI mean, so I personally,\nI've tried the blue blocker\nand I couldn't even wear them.\nI thought they were just\nreally horrendous to be honest.\n- Well, along the lines of blue blockers,\nI think a lot of people\nmistakenly wear them all day long.\n- Oh my God, that would be very bad.\n- A lot of people do that.\n- That would be very bad.\n- A lot of people do that.\nThey think that blue light is bad.\nI think that the-\n- No, no, no.\n- The concept of blue light being bad\nled to a lot of product development.\nAnd a lot of people are\njust assuming that viewing\nblue light is what was\ngiving them headaches.\nWhen in fact it might've just been\nlooking at screens at\nclose distance all day.\n- So, here's the problem, right?\nI mean, the blue light\ngot the bad reputation\nbecause people who gave a pure blue light\nshowed that it 'caused\na huge retinal damage.\nBut again, if you're using\nblue light in its pure form,\nit has a lot of energy because\nit's shorter wavelength,\nbut we're talking about\nfull spectrum light.\nThere are ways now where you could change\nthe spectrum of the\nlight and keep it white\nbetween day and night and\nchange the content of the color\nwithout you noticing.\nSo you don't even have\nto affect your vision.\n- So how would you go about doing that?\n- So, you just lower the\nlevel of the blue light.\nYou don't have to eliminate it.\n- So just dim the lights?\n- Dim the blue, then increase the yellow,\nbut keep all the colors\nin a certain white.\nSo, you know, you could have\ndifferent warmness of white.\nAnd people know how to do this.\nPhysicist know how to do this.\nPeople who work with\nlight know how to do this.\n- Well, maybe somebody\nin the wellness slash,\nI don't like the word, but biohacking,\nor optical community will do this.\nI think it's really important,\nI see so many people\nwearing blue blockers.\n- They have meetings now.\nI don't know why they block-\n- Well, I think they're just uninformed.\nI think, frankly-\n- Yeah and to be honest,\nit's easy, right?\nIt's easier to explain\nto somebody if ipRCGs\nrespond mostly to blue,\nremove blue, you'll be fine.\n- Right, right.\n- Right?\nBut that's not as simple as\nthat because they also receive\nrod and cone input.\nSo you want to actually...\nAnd we could go into details,\nthat's boring for your listeners,\nbut it also affect the adaptation\nproperties of the whole retina.\nSo you don't want to\ndo something so drastic\nthat you take just one\ncolor of the spectrum.\nIt just seems very counter\nintuitive to me, to be honest.\n- You've told me before as well,\nthat just because these\nintrinsically photosensitive\ncircadian setting ganglion cells\nrespond best to blue light,\nif the light is bright enough\nbecause they also get input\nfrom other components of the eye,\nit doesn't matter if you block the blues.\n- Yeah.\n- If you're looking\nat bright light at night,\nyou're going to disrupt\nyour circadian cycle.\n- Absolutely and that's\nwhy I didn't want to\ngo into the boring details,\nbut themselves, the\nphotoreceptors have a wide range\nof responsiveness.\nSo they are more sensitive to blue light,\nbut that doesn't mean they\ndon't respond to green light\nor to shorter than blue light.\nThey respond to very, very wide spectrum\nwith different sensitivity.\nSo unless you understand the\nsystem just removing 480,\nI don't think it's going to do-\n- 480 nanometers, yeah.\nSo, your home is a cave at\nnight basically with some-\n- It's a nice cave.\n- It's nice cave.\n- Yeah.\n- With candles.\n- That's right.\n- Right and you and your cats-\n- And I watch TV and dim it.\n- And your lovely wife.\n- Yeah.\n- Who I know, who's also\na phenomenal scientist in her own right.\n- Thank you, yeah, she is.\n- She is.\nBut you do keep your home quite dim\nto dark at night?\n- Yeah.\nIn fact, I did go to meetings\nwith some of my friends\nwho work on this and they\nreally struggled with me.\nThey said we could have\nbroken our legs living\nin the same light environment that you do.\nSo I am an extreme, but\nI measured it for myself.\nAnd I asked, Rejji, my\nwife, if she's okay with it.\nShe also liked the dimness.\nBoth of us can see well in dim conditions.\nAnd that helps us a lot,\nbut I think you have to\nmeasure it for yourself.\nYou really have to...\nIt's a very simple experiment.\nJust try to dim the\nlight as much as you can.\nI call it the minimum amount of light\nyou require to see comfortably.\n- And that's how you want your environment\nideally at night?\n- At night.\nThis is what I think is the game changer.\nIf you reach to a level\nwhere it's just barely,\nyou're literally on the\ncusp of seeing uncomfortably\nversus seeing very comfortably,\nyou are going to be very much better than\nI don't like to make it completely dark.\nI think complete darkness induce anxiety\nin humans, to be honest.\nSo I don't like complete darkness.\n- Kids don't like complete darkness.\nThey like a nightlight.\n- Even animal,\neven nocturnal animals don't\nlike complete darkness.\nI mean, we have studies in\nanimals that are nocturnal,\nthat if you put them in complete\ndarkness for several weeks,\nthey have severe anxiety\nand depression like effect.\nSo keep the light dim, use\nred light that is very dim,\nif you want to keep the room for sleeping.\nRed light that is very\ndim has very small effect\non the circadian clock.\nAnd below 10 lux of red light,\nliterally doesn't affect sleep at all.\nSo there are ways to do it.\nIt's just we need to educate the public.\nAnd I feel like you literally\nneed a whole lecture\nto just explain to the\npeople how to deal with light\nbecause it's not as\nsimple as people think.\n- Well, that's what we're doing here.\n- Yeah.\n- We're stepping through it\npiece by piece and the\nreason we're doing that\nis because it's not as simple as saying,\njust block blue light or get\na lot of light during the day,\nand minimal at night.\n- I mean, just to put it\nin perspective and tell that we only have\nthree different cones in our retina\nthat respond to three different colors.\nWe call them red cones for simplicity,\ngreen cones and blue cones.\nYet we have only three of these,\nbut we could see massive\npalette of colors.\nSo that tells you something.\nIf the system was just\nsimply about a single color\nand us just removing 480\nor just blue is sufficient,\nthen we should only see\nin red, yellow, and blue.\nWe shouldn't see all these\ndifferent hues of color,\nbut because the system is not that,\nwe see all these different colors.\nAnd that's why it's\nimportant to remind people\nthat the white light is made\nof many different colors.\nIt's actually like the rainbow.\nThat's why you see the rainbow,\nit's made of many colors.\nWhite light is never truly white.\nIt's made of lot of different colors.\n- It's like the Pink Floyd album cover.\n- Exactly.\n- With the light coming\nthrough the prism.\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- So, dim at night, maybe\ndim red light ideally,\nor candle light.\nFind that minimum required light level.\n- Test it, just make sure\nwhen you lower the lights,\nsit for at least 10 to 15\nminutes, let your system adapt.\nBecause if you had a bright\nlight and you switch it off,\nsurely you're going to\nsuffer because your system\ndidn't adapt yet; it was\nused to very bright light.\nSo you want to engage your rods,\nwhich take a long time to dark adapt.\nSo that's why I tell you,\njust wait a little bit.\nDon't just switch it off and\nnow I don't see, put it on.\nPut it off, sit down, wait for 10 minutes,\nideally 15 minutes and\nthen see how you see.\nAnd then once you do that,\nyou will notice that actually,\nyeah, I could see quite well\neven with much less light.\n- What do you do regarding screens?\n- Yeah, that's the hardest thing.\nAgain, I mean, there\nare beautiful programs\nthat change the whole intensity\nand color of the screen.\nThese could help dim your screen at night\nto the lowest part.\nI mean, yes, you won't see it\nwhen you wake up in the morning,\nbut then you can increase that intensity.\nSo, try to decrease.\nI mean, just what we were talking about.\nThink of light intensity,\nduration, color, and time of day.\nYou really have to keep these\nfour things together, right?\n- We've roomed together\nat a couple meetings\nfrom time to time, no longer,\nbecause one of us not to be\nnamed has a severe snoring issue\nthat made the other one pseudo-homicidal.\n[Samer laughing]\nYou can guess who that was.\nBut I've seen you check your phone\nafter dark once or twice.\n- Mm hm.\n- And you did it by sort\nof pointing your phone\naway from you, right?\n- Exactly, yep, absolutely.\n- And actually I'm sort of half joking,\nand you dim it quite a bit.\n- Yeah, dim it quite a lot.\n- I'm sort of half joking,\nbut it actually makes\nsense that if you shine\na flashlight in your eye,\nit's much brighter than\nif you shine a flashlight-\n- Light only go in direct line,\nso if you'd just look on the side,\nmost of the light is going to go this way,\nand you're only seeing this way.\n- Okay, so, and as\nsilly as that might seem\nto people listening, I mean what it means\nis that getting bright\nlight in your eyes at night\nis something that you\nreally want to avoid.\nBut there is the reality that-\n- And even when I check\nsometimes if I have something,\nand I check it so fast\nand switch it off so fast.\nSo I'm also aware of duration-\n- Not my messages.\n- I'm also aware of the duration, right?\nSo duration, intensity,\ncolor, and time of day.\nIdeally I should not\ncheck iPhones an iPads.\nI don't use iPad at\nnight because it's hard\nto lower it enough 'cause it's a huge.\nBut even my iPhone, I try\nnot to use it at night.\nAnd like once it becomes 8:30 or 9:00,\nI don't look at it at all.\n- Unless it's World Cup\nor Euro Cup, in which case\nSamer's on 24 hours, everybody.\n- Right, that's only every four years.\n- He's a big soccer fan.\nAll right, this has been\nincredibly, no pun, illuminating.\nLet's talk about the\nrelationship between light\nand some of these other non-circadian\nor pseudo-circadian effects.\nAnd we will try and link those.\nBut you had a what I\nconsider absolutely landmark\nbeautiful paper published\nin \"Nature\" a few years ago,\nshowing that if you disrupt\nthe exposure to light\nor the timing of the exposure to light\nthat there are dramatic\neffects on the stress system\nand on the learning and memory system.\nMaybe we could talk about each of those\nseparately or together.\nWhat are the effects on stress\nand the effects on learning\nwhen light viewing behavior\nand sleep-wake cycles are disrupted?\n- Yeah, so just to remind\nyou, you know that,\nbut to remind your\nlisteners that I was trained\nas a circadian biologist.\nSo I really was indoctrinated\ninto thinking that light\nhas to affect the clock,\nwhich then caused all\nthese different effects.\nSo, that's what I believe.\nThat's my dogma.\nThat's what have made me really happy.\nAnd then Tara LeGates and\nCara Altimus joined the lab\nand we started discussing a lot of data.\nAnd we said, what if there\nis a direct effect of light\nthat we're missing, independent\nof the circadian clock?\nSo this is not an easy\nquestion to us to answer,\nbecause as we've been talking all along,\nlight affects the circadian clock.\nSo how could you give light\nat different times of the day\nand not mess up the circadian clock?\nLuckily, we came up with such a way,\nand that's why it was important\nto do these experiments\nthe way we did them.\nAnd we proved that this light-dark cycle\ndoes not disrupt the clock,\nthere is still a circadian rhythm,\nand does not cause sleep deprivation.\nAnd yet, surprisingly, if you give light\nat the wrong time of the day,\neven without disrupting\nthe circadian clock\nor without causing sleep deprivation,\nas you mentioned you get\nthe huge mood changes\nin the organisms and you\nget learning deficit.\nSo, this really, and at\nthe time people have really\nhit us hard.\nI mean, it was really\nhard to publish this work\nand you could, yeah.\n- Well, it came out in \"Nature.\"\n- Yeah.\n- So in the end you prevailed,\nbut I want to make sure that I understand.\nSo, you're saying that yes,\nthere are effects of light\non the circadian rhythm.\n- Absolutely.\n- Sleep meaning\nsleep and wakefulness.\n- Yes.\n- And their timing.\nHowever, there are direct\neffects of light on mood\nthat can be dissociated from the effects\non sleep and waking.\n- Absolutely.\n- So if I interpret that correctly,\nthat could mean that when we\nview light and how much light,\ncould make us feel happier or\nless happy or even depressed,\nstressed, learning, et cetera.\n- Bingo.\n- Even if we're sleeping\nand waking up at the appropriate time?\n- Bingo.\nI mean, eventually because we're talking\nabout the whole system,\neventually when you start\nhaving the other problems,\nyou also develop sleep problems,\nbut you're absolutely right.\nAnd in fact, now, research\nfrom Diego Fernandez\nin the lab have found that\nnow we know that they actually\nrequire different brain regions.\nSo we don't only have a theory,\nwe don't only have a light environment\nthat showed they can be dissociated,\nwe know that they use completely\ndifferent brain regions.\nSo, the SCN that I told you about earlier,\nthe place where the central pacemaker is,\nthe one that receives\ndirect input from the retina\nthrough the ipRCGs to\nadjust your circadian clock\nis not the area that\nreceives the light input\nfor mood regulation.\nIt's a completely different brain region.\n- What's the brain region called?\n- So the brain region,\nwe called it the perihabenular nucleus.\nI'm not so sure how good or bad the name,\nbut it doesn't matter, it's that PHb.\nAnd what's really amazing,\nthis region also receives direct input\nfrom the ipRCGs, but projects\nto areas in the brain\nthat are known to regulate mood,\nincluding the ventromedial\nprefrontal cortex,\nwhich has been studied for many years\nto be impacted in the human depression.\nSo just by this amazing serendipity\nto find that a region that is\nso deep in the advanced brain,\nlike the prefrontal cortex\nis your executive brain,\none of the most elaborated in humans,\nto see that they receive inputs from\nthese ancient photoreceptor\nwas stunning to us,\nand told us how much we didn't understand\nthe importance of light\non a human behavior.\n- So, how does that finding\ninform daily protocols\nfor you or for other people?\nI realize you can't leap\nalways from one paper-\n- Absolutely, yes.\n- To daily protocol.\nBut if light indeed does\ncontrol prefrontal cortex,\nexecutive function,\nlearning, stress and mood,\nand let's say I'm waking up\neach morning and I'm sleeping.\nWhat should I do different?\n- That's why we came up\nwith the tripartite model\nbecause yes, we could think\nabout just adjusting the clock\nwith lights in and being\ndark throughout the day.\nBut that may not be important\nfor your whole physiological function.\nSo, now, if we include these\nother effects of light,\nthat's why I prefer to still\nget a lot of light in the day.\nI don't want to be in\nvery dim light condition\nthroughout the day.\n- I see.\n- So, even though it\ndoesn't affect your clock,\nas you beautifully said, Andrew,\nit may affect your mood\nand learning and memory.\nIt may affect your alertness level,\nwhich is going to allow\nyou to learn better.\nIt may affect your homeostatic drive,\nmaybe your homeostatic\nfactor would go higher\nso you could sleep earlier.\nSo it's important to think\nof light as stimulating\nall these brain regions,\nwhich means it's producing more activity,\nwhich in reality this is how people think\nof the homeostatic drive,\nthat the more active you are,\nthe more the homeostatic\ndrive is built up,\nthe better you sleep.\nSo that's why we came up\nwith the tripartite model\nbecause as a circadian biologist,\nI only thought of light\nthrough the circadian clock\naffecting behavior.\nAs a sleep biologist, they\nonly thought of the homeostatic\ndrive affecting sleep, affecting behavior.\nAnd for people who study light\nfor vision and other form,\nthey thought only of\nthe environmental input.\nBut now if you put them all together,\nyou get with this tripartite model\nwhere it's really mind boggling.\nAnd it makes so much sense.\nThe organism doesn't want to\ndepend on a single component,\nbut if you could incorporate\nthese three together,\nyou could have a beautiful\nsystem that is well adapted.\nSo let me tell you the\nsleep-wake cycle, right?\nSo we know that there\nis a homeostatic drive\nto affect sleep.\nYou've had beautiful talks about that.\n- Which is basically\nthe longer you're awake,\nthe more you want to be asleep.\n- So, that's your homeostatic drive.\nWe've talked about the\ncircadian influence of sleep\nand the fact that light-dark cycle\naffect the circadian system,\nwhich eventually affects sleep.\nSo these two components\nare well understood.\nNow the third factor is your direct light\nor environmental input.\nHow much stress, how much\nlight you get from there\nalso can highly impact sleep.\nSo even if you have a good\ncircadian and homeostatic drive,\nif you're getting light at\nthe wrong time of the day,\nor if you're being stressed\nand thinking a lot,\nthen your sleep is going to suffer.\nSo you have to think of the three together\nto have a beautiful sleep-wake cycle.\n- I see.\n- And that's why\nwe came up with the tripartite model.\nThe same thing happens with feeding.\nI could beautifully put it to people.\nYour hunger, your energy level is measured\nby the arcuate nucleus.\nYour daily intake of food is again,\ndependent on the SCN and light-dark input.\nWe found that if food is not available,\nthere is yet a third input that\nis not depending on the SCN,\nnot depend on the arcuate,\ndepending on a completely\ndifferent brain regions.\nSo the animal can actually start looking\nor the human can start looking\nfor food when it's scarce,\neven at time when they are\nnot supposed to be active.\nSo, that's how the organism think,\nthey have to evaluate multiple\ninputs for them to decide\nwhat is the best physiological outcome\nat that moment, at that season?\n- I see.\nSo, I want to get into\narcuate and feeding,\nbut just to make sure\nwe can keep our hands\naround this tripartite model.\nSo, if I understand correctly,\nwe've got the circadian influence,\nthen you've also got the drive to sleep.\n- Right.\n- Actually, one of the ways\nthat I think that can be best\nunderstood is if somebody\never pulls an all-nighter,\nthey get tired around\n11:00 or 12:00 or so,\nand then very tired\naround 3:00, 4:00 a.m.,\nbut then even if you stay\nup sometime right around\n7:00 or 8:00 a.m., your\nnormal wake up time,\nyou start to feel alert again.\n- Exactly.\n- And that's because\nthe sleep drive is extremely strong,\nbut there's a circadian rhythm that drives\nwakefulness in the morning.\n- Exactly.\n- Okay, so that's two are the components.\n- [Samer] Right.\n- Before we get into\nthe feeding component,\nI want to talk about these direct effects\nof light on mood.\n- Mm hm.\n- Okay, Diego Fernandez's data.\nAnd this perihabenular thing.\n- Sure.\n- So, let's just for the\nmoment set aside the tri part\nof the tripartite model and just focus on\nwhat are the direct\neffects of light on mood?\nAnd the way that I interpret\nwhat you've said so far\nis that the protocol\nthat emerges from this\nif one trying to optimize their mood is,\nyes, see light, view light I\nshould say, early in the day,\nin order to set your circadian clock.\nMaybe also in the evening as well.\nAnd of course, avoid light at night,\nget it as dim as possible.\nHowever, you said, it's\nalso a good idea to get\nas much bright light during\nthe day as you safely can,\nin order to improve\nyour mood independently\nof regulating your sleep-wake cycle.\n- And that's the hypothesis.\nHere's the problem where\nit's not going to be\nas satisfying as the\ncircadian is that as you know,\nthis brain region has been\ndiscovered very recently.\n- Habenula?\n- The perihabenular region.\n- Well, we've known about it a long time,\nbut nobody knew what it did.\n- So, we knew about the habenula,\nbut that's why the name is confusing.\nIt's actually not the habenula itself.\nIt's the perihabenular.\n- Oh, near the habenula.\n- It's near the habenula.\n- Why don't you just call\nit the Samer Hattar nucleus?\n- I should have.\nI don't know why I haven't done that.\n- Maybe 'cause if you\ndo that, it's not okay.\nOkay, so for here ever after\nthe perihabenular nucleus,\nwe should probably call it the Hattar-\n- The Hattar-Fernandez.\n- How about\nHattar-Fernandez-Berson nucleus.\n- Yeah, that should-\n- Okay, this is like nerdy\nscience attribution stuff,\nbut I'm just going to call it\nthe Hattar nucleus.\nWikipedia, line it up.\nOkay, so this structure is taking light,\nand independent of sleep\nrhythms and circadian rhythms,\nit's driving changes in mood.\n- Something.\n- How does it do that?\nIs this through the dopamine system?\nThe serotonin system?\n- We still recently,\nwe haven't identified\nthis region very well.\nWe don't know what light does to it.\nWe don't know how it interacts.\nSo this is an area that\nis ripe for discoveries\nand we're working on this right now.\nBut that's why I said,\nit's not satisfying.\nThis is like the function of sleep.\nWhy do we sleep?\nWe know sleep is very important to us,\nbut we still don't have\na satisfying function\nof why do we sleep, right?\n- I see but the why questions-\n- We have hypothesis.\n- The why questions, I\nthink it's our good friend\nand colleague at University of Washington,\nRuss Van Gelder, who always says,\nwhen somebody asks why, that\nthe best answer is just to say,\nI wasn't consulted at the design phase.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- Right, none of us\nreally know why.\n- No, but the point is\nmaybe I shouldn't have said why,\nwhat is the function of sleep?\nIt's still very hard to know.\nWhat is the reason organisms\nhave to go offline for so long?\nYou know, people assume it's for repair,\nassume it's for learning and memory,\nassume all kind of stuff,\nbut there is really no\nclear function for sleeping.\nThere is no clear function for sleeping.\nI mean, if you talk to\npeople, there are hypotheses.\n- I mean, all we know is\nthat if you don't sleep-\n- Exactly.\n- Or your sleep\nis very fractured, you get messed up.\n- And you could die even, right?\nI mean, it's really\nbad if you don't sleep,\nbut we don't know what is the function?\nWhat is that sleep have done to organisms\nthat couldn't have done with rest?\nWhat if you just could\nrest without sleeping?\nJust sit down and rest.\n- Well, my lab is trying to\nfigure out whether or not\nthese non-sleep deep rest protocols\ncan compensate for sleep.\n- That would be interesting.\n- I mean, obviously sleep\nis better, but many people are not getting\nthe sleep that they need.\n- Right.\n- But, okay.\nSo, and if people are\nsensing that Samer and I\nare about to start talking\nover each other and arguing,\nthat's always the goal\nwhen we talk, right?\n- That's right.\n- Unlike other scientists I interact with,\nwhen Samer and I get together,\nit's considered a successful conversation\nif we get into a big fight,\nand then go for a big meal-\n- That's right.\n- Where I pick the restaurant.\n[Samer chuckling]\nOkay, so let's talk about\nfood and eating and appetite.\nYou had yet another, yes, I\ngreatly admire your success\nin this way, yet another\nincredible discovery\nshowing that there are\ndirect effects of light\non appetite and feeding behavior.\nOkay, maybe you could just summarize\nthose results for people.\n- Honestly, that paper is\nthe one that allowed us\nto come with the tripartite model,\nbecause we were thinking\ncompletely wrong about it.\nWe wanted, this experiment,\nit'd be fun for your audience\nto hear why we started this experiment.\nRemember that when we\ndiscovered the ipRCGs,\nwe figured if they are the only relay\nto entrain the circadian clock,\nthen you could kill them\nand have an animal opposite\nto the one that we spoke or\na human opposite to the one\nthat we spoke about earlier.\nWhere instead of having no pattern vision\nand have circadian photoentrainment,\nwe could produce an animal\nthat have pattern vision,\nbut no circadian photoentrainment.\n- Hm, so circadian blind.\n- Circadian blind, but pattern sighted.\nAnd we succeeded in that.\nThe problem when you have these animals,\nwhich I've told you many times already\nis that they don't adjust\nto the day-night cycle.\nSo doing experiments on them\nbecome very complicated.\n- What is their behavior like\nif you don't have these cells?\nAre they awake and then\nasleep, awake and then asleep?\n- They just drift like the\nhumans we've talked about.\n- They think they're in Las Vegas\nwith no clocks or watch-\n- They drift, exactly.\n- They stay up later every\nnight and go to sleep-\n- They can either, depend on their clock.\nIf their clock is shorter,\nthey come in earlier.\nIf their clock is longer,\nthey come in later.\n- So they're really messed up?\n- They really don't adjust to it.\nIf they were in the wild,\nthey'll be eliminated in a second, right?\nThere is no way they'll survive.\nSo, me and Diego started\ntalking and we're like,\nwhat if we use non-light\nin training agent?\nAnd what is the strongest\nnon-light in training agent?\nFood.\nSo we thought that the\nlight defective animals\nwill have more sensitivity\nto food entrainment\nbecause as you know more than me,\nthis is an area that you've\nworked really well on,\nfor vision, if you're image blind,\nyour hearing and somatosensory\nget improved, right?\nThe lack of vision improves\nyour hearing and sensation.\nBut we found actually\nthat if you don't have\nthe light to system, actually\nthe food ability to entrain\nthe animal goes completely to the ground.\nCompletely opposite to what we predicted.\n- So light viewing and feeding\nbehavior are interacting\nin ways that support one another.\n- And that's why we came\nwith the tripartite model.\nWe figured it's different than\nsensation of the environment.\nWhen you sense with vision,\nvision and hearing interact,\nbut your vision is a real full modality.\nYou want to see.\nThat's what vision wants to do.\nYou want to hear.\nThat's what hearing wants to do.\nYou want to sense.\nThat's what sensing want to do.\nBut for the circadian system, light, food,\nall these entraining agent,\nthey somehow have to interact\nto keep a coherent system.\nYou don't just assume if you remove light,\nthis one is going to be stronger.\nNo, they need to know each others.\nThe light informs when the\nanimal is going to eat.\n- Well, what I like about\nthis so much is that\nin the world outside of science,\nin which I don't really exist\nin, but that I see a lot of,\nthis kind of wellness and stuff with\nall this mind-body integration stuff.\nIt's interesting because\npeople view the body\nmore as a system, right?\nA system of organs that interact,\nas opposed to the way\nthat standard science\nand medical profession is like,\nyou work on the liver or\nyou're ear, nose and throat,\nor heart and lung, or brain or-\n- Wow, that's a great\nway of thinking about it.\n- But the biology is integrated.\n- Yeah.\n- And so, for somebody who's\ninterested in effecting\ntheir eating behavior,\nsomething that you are familiar with,\nand that we will talk more about\nyour experiences of in a moment,\nhow should they use\nlight in order to adjust\ntheir eating behavior?\n- Right.\nSo, now that I've told you\nabout all these interaction\nbetween the different inputs\nto the circadian clock,\njust you think about it as an engineer,\nwhat would be the best thing?\nThe best thing is to know\nwhen your food times happen\nin the day, when should you get light,\nand when is your circadian\nclock in your system, right?\nSo, if you eat at very\nspecific times of the day,\nthat's another signal that is\ntelling your body, your clock,\nyou're in a certain time of the day.\nSo if you're having lunch at\nthe correct time every day,\nand you're getting bright light,\nnow you have two systems that\nare informing your clock,\nyour clock is going to be better.\n- So regular mealtimes?\n- Regular mealtimes that\nfit your circadian clock.\nSo, and in fact, if you do\nthat, when I started doing this,\nand it helped me lose weight,\nis that I'm exposing\nmyself to the right amount\nof light-dark cycle, I'm\neating at regular time.\nIt is amazing.\nYou would be not hungry,\nlet's say you eat at noon,\nyou will not feel any hunger at 11:45.\nAnd then all of a sudden the hunger jumps.\nThis is clearly not an energy issue\nbecause it could not be that drastic.\n- No, the desire to eat is\nmainly driven by these cues,\nthese hormone cues that are\nvery exquisitely timed to-\n- Exactly.\n- Sleep-wake cycle,\nbut also to light.\n- Exactly.\nAnd you know, in the wild,\nyou could imagine why energy level\nthrough the arcuate nucleus-\n- You should explain to\npeople what the arcuate is\n'cause I don't think we've\ndone that adequately.\nThe arcuate nucleus is an\narea of the hypothalamus\nthat drives hunger and feeding behavior.\nAnd what we're talking\nabout is the fact that\nit's taking cues from\nyour viewing of light,\nbelieve it or not, is\nimpacting your level of hunger.\nAnd this is a non-trivial way\nin which your timing of hunger\nand amount of hunger is regulated by when\nand how much light you view.\nSo, let me ask you a couple of practical-\n- But can I just, this is\nreally, before you asked me-\n- Sure.\n- Sorry, Andrew.\nWe said we are going to fight, but to me,\nthe interesting thing to think about it,\nin the wild when you didn't\nhave the availability\nof food that we have,\nthe arcuate plays a huge\nimportant role because\nif you weren't successful\nin getting food, then the\narcuate is going to tell you,\nlook, you have to take\nrisks and go get food\nbecause your energy level is very low.\nAnd that's great, there's tons\nof great research about that.\nBut I think what's missing\nis the fact in humans,\nwe're not getting to a situation...\nMost of us, we're not\ngetting to a situation\nwhere we have low energy levels.\nMost of the time actually\nwe eat not because\nwe are really have low energy,\nbut because we want to eat.\nSo I think that's why\nI feel that the timing\nis very important for us because we always\nhave enough energy level for us to eat.\n- Well, I mean, I enjoy\neating so much that I'll eat\njust for the sensation of chewing.\n- True, true.\n- I mean,\nI enjoy the taste too.\n- True, absolutely.\n- And I enjoy the social aspects\nwhen those are a part of it.\n- Absolutely.\n- But I literally enjoyed\nthe physical act of chewing.\n- [Samer] Absolutely, absolutely.\nUh huh.\n- Which explains a lot.\nOkay, so how regular are\nyou or do you recommend\npeople be about mealtimes?\nBecause what I'm hearing is\nthat light viewing behavior\nis pretty straightforward.\nGet a lot of light in the\nmorning and throughout the day,\nminimize it in the evening and\nat night, generally speaking,\nfor sake of mood and circadian rhythm.\nBut for sake of regulating\ntiming and quality\nI should also say of food intake,\nbecause people clearly make\nbetter choices about food intake\nwhen they are anticipating a meal\nand they aren't constantly hungry.\nAnd so, the ability to regulate\nhunger for particular phases\nof the circadian cycle is\nquite valuable for all people.\nNot just people trying to\nlose weight, but all people.\nAre we talking about down to the minute?\n- Absolutely not.\n- All right, so 12:00\nnoon is my normal lunch,\nlet's say plus or minus?\n- Half an hour.\n- Okay.\nSo eat around between 11:30 and 12:30.\n- If that's the time.\nAnd it depends if you\nalso do multiple meals.\nRemember three meals, that's\na decision that somebody\ncame up with, I don't know why.\n- And nowadays, fewer people\nare doing that I think.\n- Yeah.\n- Given our friend,\nSatchin Panda's work.\n- Right.\nI mean, so you could have two meals,\nyou could have very multiple\nmeals that are distributed\nacross your active time.\nI agree with Satchin Panda's\nwork that try to avoid eating\nwhen your system is\nsupposed to be relaxing,\nwhen you're supposed to\nbe at non-active times.\nSo, limit your eating to the\nactive time of your cycle.\nAnd that seemed to be, and Joe Takashi\nis doing some beautiful stuff on this,\nthat seems to be incredibly important\nfor aspect of the circadian.\n- And for health.\n- And for health.\n- Yeah, we're referring\nto Satchin Panda's work,\nhe wrote a beautiful book\ncalled \"The Circadian Code.\"\nMaybe Samer, with some luck\nyou'll write a book as well.\nMeaning the world will be\nlucky to have that book,\nbut Satchin's data really\nstrongly point to the fact\nthat liver health, brain\nhealth, metabolic factors,\nand endocrine factors of\nvarious systems and organs\nall seem to benefit from having\na period of each 24 hour day\nin which we are not eating anything\nand then eating at very regular mealtimes.\n- [Samer] Absolutely.\n- Let's talk about eating and mealtimes\nand let's move a little bit away\nfrom the science for the moment,\nalthough we will return to it,\nand talk a little bit\nmore about your experience\nwith eating and mealtimes.\nSo, you're looking in good shape lately.\n- Thank you.\n- I know you've been\nputting work into it.\n- Yeah.\n- We talk a lot and you've been exercising\nand you've been eating\nwell, meaning quality food.\nYou just came back from Jordan\nwhere I'm assuming the food is amazing.\n- Yes, the food is amazing and honestly,\nusually I gain a lot of weight in Jordan,\nbut this time I didn't gain any weight,\nwhich was really nice, so.\n- Yeah, when I met you, you\nwere probably about 100 pounds\nheavier than you are now.\n- Yeah, 275 pounds.\nI'm 219 now.\nIt's crazy, yeah.\n- You had a lot of vigor then,\nand you have a lot of vigor now,\nbut I know that you undertook\na very specific protocol\nin order to lose the weight,\nbased on your understanding\nof the circadian system-\n- Yes!\n- And of light,\nand appetite and mood.\nMaybe you could just tell\nus a little bit about\nwhat that schedule looks like.\nAnd we realize that this\nis not a prescriptive\nfor everybody, but you\nfound what worked for you.\n- Yeah.\n- To maybe just describe\nthose changes.\n- I mean, honestly,\nI followed my circadian cycle, right?\nOf what we've talked about, right?\nSo I dimmed the light at night,\nI slept at regular hours,\nI ate my major food in breakfast and lunch\nwhen I'm really active\nand I'm really hungry.\nAnd at night when I avoid dinner,\nbecause my circadian system\nreally shuts off at 3:00.\nI'm an early person.\nLike you could give me anything\nI would eat before 3:00,\nafter 3:00, nothing appeals to me anymore.\nMy system is shut off.\n- Well, what time are you going to sleep?\nAnd what time are you waking up?\n- Oh, so in my case, I\nshould have put this up.\nI mean, I go to sleep\nliterally at 9:00 p.m..\nI mean, I literally five\nminutes after 9:00 p.m.,\nI'm completely out.\nAnd I wake up between 4:30 and 5:00 a.m..\nSo if I extend it, I go to 6:00 a.m.,\nbut very rarely.\nIt depends on how tired I was.\n- And that, as I recall, was\nan important set of changes\nfor you to be able to-\n- Absolutely.\n- Regulate your food intake.\n- Absolutely because then I'm\nhaving very big breakfast,\nand again for different\npeople it's different,\nI have a big breakfast\nat 7:00 a.m. maximum.\nSo I have a big breakfast,\ncoffee, and all this stuff.\nThen I have some simple\nsnack around 10:00.\nThen I have regularly lunch at noon,\nor between noon to 1:00.\nThen I have another snack at 3:00.\nAnd the hardest time to regulate the food\nis between 12:00 and 3:00.\nThis is when I really\nfeel hungry all the time.\n- This is your equivalent of kind of\nlate evening for most people.\n- Yes!\n- So for me,\nit would probably be\nbetween 7:00 and 10:00 p.m..\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- Got it.\n- And then at night I'm\ncompletely not hungry,\nbut usually as you said,\nthe beauty or the enjoyment of food,\nlike when my wife cooks some\nreally beautiful Indian food,\nI eat, but I'm not hungry.\nAnd I notice if I eat with\nthat, I usually gain weight.\nBut if I regulate that at\nnight, I also lose weight.\nSo there is a combination of\nall these things that help you\nadjust the input of\nfood, the input of light,\nthe input of the clock,\nand the drive to hunger.\n- Yeah, I appreciate you sharing that.\nAnd I want to emphasize that some people\nare not hungry early in the day.\nThey might be late shifted people.\n- Exactly.\n- In which case,\neating later in the day\nwill work well for them.\n- It will work well as\nlong as they don't eat\nearly in the morning.\nThat's just, you have to\nwork with your schedule,\nwith your active schedule.\n- Yeah, you and I have been talking\nabout this offline for years.\nI'm glad we're finally having\nthis discussion publicly now.\nWhat we're talking about really is finding\nyour ideal sleep schedule.\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- And finding your ideal\neating schedule.\n- Exactly.\n- And understanding how\nthose two things interact.\n- And do you know the\nnice thing, as you said,\nfinding them out is going to help you\nto understand how they interact\nbecause we know from the tripartite model\nthat they are all interconnected.\nAnd for each person they're going to be\ninterconnected differently.\nSo, for each person you would...\nYou know, for me, if I exercise at night,\nI'm going to mess up my whole system.\n- When do you exercise?\n- Morning.\nMorning works great for me.\nI mean, it's amazing.\nMorning exercise for me works great.\nIf I tried one time,\nbecause it was easier for me\nto exercise at night before I leave,\nwhen the traffic is there from the night.\nAnd I think that messed me up\nbecause I couldn't sleep well\nand I couldn't wake up well.\nAnd that led to more changes in my food.\nI gained weight again\nactually, believe it or not,\neven though I was exercising.\nSo I think this really makes\nme think that you have to think\nof the tripartite model to\nsee what is the best times\nand what is the best interrelation between\nthe different component,\nas you beautifully said,\nbetween your mealtimes,\nyour light exposure,\nand your sleep that works for you.\n- Well, thanks for that.\nUsually Samer's insulting me.\nToday, he's complimenting me.\nI'm going to compliment\nhim right back by saying,\nthis is the first time that\nI've ever really understood\nhow yes, light can control sleep.\nYes, it control mood.\nYes, it can impact feeding,\nbut that it's really about\ndoing the self exploration\nto align those in the way that works best.\nAnd what I'm hearing,\ntell me if I'm wrong,\nbut what I'm hearing is\nthat once you understand\nwhat gives you the best sleep-wake cycle,\nthen you should exercise\nduring the period of time\nin which you feel most alert.\nAnd if it works for your schedule,\nideally you would also eat\nduring the time in which\nyou feel most alert and then stop eating\nand stop light viewing behavior\nas you head towards sleep.\n- Right.\nSo, the only thing I would say\nthat complicates all of this,\nand that's what makes me\nsad, is your light exposure.\n- Mine personally?\n- Sorry.\n- No, I'm just kidding.\n- The people's light exposure, right?\nThis is what complicates it\nbecause you're not going to be able\nto figure all this out if\nyou're shifting yourself\nout of your comfort zone.\n- By viewing-\n- By viewing light\nat the wrong time of the day.\nSo, let's say if you were under\nan ideal natural conditions,\nyou're a person who would\nsleep later than me.\nLet's say we'll sleep at midnight\nand wake up at 8:00 a.m..\nLet's say you don't\neat anything till noon,\nand as you said, you\neat late in the evening.\nThen this would be perfect for you,\nbut now see what happens\nif now you include\nthe light component.\nNow, if you push your sleep\nfrom midnight to 4:00 a.m.,\nnow you're waking up in the\nmorning and you're actually\nreally not the morning...\nYou're working, I'm sorry, at\nnoon instead of eight o'clock,\nand the time where you're\nnot supposed to be hungry,\nnow you're going to start\neating directly at noon\nor something like that, or even delay it.\nAnd now you're shifting your whole cycle.\nAnd you don't know if this\ninteraction between your sleep,\nfeeding and the light-dark environment\nare still going to be maintained or not.\nAnd that's the problem that people have.\n- So, as I'm hearing this what\nI'm realizing is most of us,\nprobably me included, are\nmessing up at least one, two,\nor three of these components.\n- Exactly, exactly.\n- But that the probe, the way\nto figure out what's right\nfor oneself is to start\nmanipulating light exposure.\n- Right and I'm going to be honest,\nI'm biased 'cause I believe that light\nis the strongest time giver.\nAnd a lot of people disagree.\nSome people think feeding is.\n- I always thought that light\nwas the primary zeitgeber,\nthe primary light-\n- Yeah, but a lot of people\nthink it's food.\nA lot of people even sometimes\nmentioned social interaction.\n- Have they read the literature?\n- I agree with you.\nI totally agree with you.\n- I mean, my understanding is that light\nis the most powerful driver-\n- Absolutely.\n- Of the things we're talking about.\n- That's why I think we\nneed to regulate this first\nand everything else fits.\nAnd you know, the nice thing\nis that your sleep-wake cycle\nand exercise tell you really bluntly\nif you're doing it right or not.\n- Tell me more about that.\n- I'll tell you more.\nWhen I shifted my exercise, honestly,\nthings fell apart like never before.\n- When you moved from\nexercising early in the day\nto late in the day?\n- In the morn, yeah.\nIt completely fell apart for me.\nI didn't enjoy exercise at night.\nMy pain tolerance for\nexercise wasn't as good.\nI'm talking with N equals\none and I'm aware of this.\nI've never tested this\nempirically, but at least to me,\nit really messed up everything.\nI started having problem\nbecause my body temperature\nwould go up and that will affect my sleep.\nI possibly was running in\nthe gym with a lot of lights.\nSo maybe the light was\na component, but for me,\nexercising in the morning,\nit's so much better for me.\nBut a lot of people can't even\nthink of exercising in the morning.\nSo it depends on when you feel comfortable\nin your sleep-wake\ncycle and your exercise.\nI think that tells you if your system\nis in synchrony with one another.\n- That's really interesting.\nWe're good friends, our\nfriend, Pat Dossett,\nthat we both know.\n- Mm hm, oh, absolutely.\n- He did nine years in the Seal Teams.\nAnd he's one of these people he says,\nhe's happy to go for a\nrun or a swim anytime\nbetween 4:30 a.m. and 6:00 a.m..\nAnd he'll train in the afternoon too\n'cause he's a Seal Team guy and\nthey'll do whatever anytime,\nthat's part of the phenotype,\nbut he feels best doing that, right?\nI like to exercise mid-morning.\n- Interesting.\n- And I'm happy to skip eating\nuntil 12 or 1:00.\n- Great.\n- And I like to go to\nsleep around 11:30, 12:00,\n'cause I'm a normal human\nbeing rather than you\nwho goes to bed at 9:00 p.m.\n- What about Pat actually?\nI've never asked him what time.\n- Pat?\nSo, Pat's ideal to sleep\ntime, I've asked him this,\nwould be around 8:30 or 9:00 except now-\n- Oh, so I'm like Pat!\n- Yes, but he has two\nyoung children, two\nyears old and a newborn.\nAnd so, the cycle is disrupted, right?\n- Yeah, but that's known, right?\nI mean the effect of childbearing.\n- Right.\n- And I think that we could\ntalk about this, that's more complicated-\n- Right.\n- But that's pretty much.\n- Yeah, I mean, I think we\nneed to come up with a new name\nfor chronotype because-\n- I agree, I agree.\n- Chronotype implies that it's\njust about sleep and wake;\nbeing an early bird or a night owl.\nAnd what we're also talking\nabout is how exercise\nand eating match onto those.\n- The the phase relation between them.\n- Right.\n- And the phases between\ndifferent components, as you said.\n- 'Cause they interact.\n- Because they interact.\n- Right.\n- And they don't have\nto be in the same phase.\nLike let's say my light and food\ncould be very close to each other.\nYour light and food could\nbe different, right?\nThe phases don't have to\nbe, they can be plastic.\nSo you have to find this for yourself.\nYou maybe you're a person\nwho eats late at night,\nexercises late at night,\nor you may be a person who\nexercise early, eat later.\nSo, as long as the phase is good,\nthat's what you have to find out.\n- Okay and if I understand correctly,\nwhen you're talking\nabout phase relationship,\nit means you want to lump\nexercise, feeding and light for-\n- And sleep.\n- And sleep in a way\nthat as a coherent and total system\nmakes you feel really good.\n- Temporally in a great order.\n- Uh uh.\n- Absolutely.\n- And I think that-\n- And I could tell you to me\nis literally getting exposed\nto sun clearly in the morning,\nclearly at noon, I go out,\nI keep my windows in the\noffice completely open,\neating mostly in the early\ntime of the day and exercising.\nAnd literally at the end part of the day,\nI'm not really in a more\nthoughtful vegetative state.\nLike I really can't like after\n5:00, I tell my students,\nif you want to tell me\nanything complicated,\nyou're wasting your time.\nMy brain just doesn't function.\nSo even though I only sleep at night,\nbut I'm really starting\nto shut off, ramp down.\nReally I mean, I could send email,\ntalk about brainless stuff, but my power,\nmy energy to do powerful stuff\nreally drop tremendously.\nSo all my students who know me very well,\nthey put the meetings with\nme early in the morning\n'cause they know this is when I'm...\nSo, everything for me and\nfor me, it's very tight.\nSo it could be different for...\nIt's very clustered in the morning.\nIt's all tied together.\nAnd literally the remaining part\nseems to be just a vegetative state.\n- Mm hm.\nYeah, you and my bulldog, Costello,\nwho unfortunately passed away recently.\n- Oh no.\n- Yeah.\n- I did not, that's so sad.\n- Yeah, Samer and Costello\nwere good friends.\nYeah, sorry to break it to you here.\nYeah, he had a good long\nlife and he went easy,\nbut he had a circadian clock\nthat basically would just sleep\naround 24 hours a day,\nminimal activity interspersed\nevery third day or so.\nYou do have this morning vigor.\n- Yes.\n- And I think other people\nare going to have more\nof an afternoon vigor.\nDo you think that this can\nchange across the lifespan?\nThe rumor is that teenagers\nnaturally want to sleep in later\nand stay up later.\nDo you think that's social rhythm?\nOr do you think that\nthat's actually biological?\n- Yeah, that's a tough question.\nI mean, it could be both.\nOne thing that worries me is\nthat it seems that if anything,\nwith age this morning rigor gets stronger.\n- You mean, you want people to become more\nof morning people.\n- More of morning people.\n- Well, why does that worry you?\nI think that's good.\n- Because for me, I'm\nalready very shifted morning.\nI don't want to be one of these 7:00 p.m.\nto 1:00 a.m. sleepers at some point.\n- On the other hand,\nit's also kind of nice\nbecause it's quiet and\nyou can get work done.\n- Yeah, but honestly from 4:30 till 7:30\nwhen my wife wake up, it can be very long.\nYes, you achieved a lot,\nbut it's quiet outside.\nSo, I don't want to be at 1:00\na.m., let's put it this way.\n- You can tell Samer is\nmore social than I am.\n- That's right, that is true.\n- But we should touch on that actually.\nSo, your wife, she follows\na different schedule.\n- Yeah.\n- So, the social rhythm-\n- I'm honestly...\n- Is important I think.\nWhat should we do?\nHow should we conceptualize\nand how should we adjust\nourselves according to the social rhythm?\n- And I honestly love this hypothesis\nthat people came up with and\nPat's kids reminded me of.\nBecause kids are really going to\ndisrupt your sleep-wake cycle,\nit seems like there is\na chrono attraction.\nThat's usually people\nwho attract each others\nhave actually different\nsleep-wake schedule.\nAnd the idea being is\nthat this allows them\nto take care of their kids\nthroughout the day-night cycle.\n- And have a peaceful marriage.\n- And have a peaceful\nmarriage in a way, right?\nSo, I mean, we didn't\nhave kids, me and Rejji.\nSo maybe this is, but it\nseems like evolutionary\nit makes sense that if you\nwant to protect your kids,\nyou don't want everybody\nto be morning vigor,\nand then the kids don't have.\nSo you want it distributed across.\nI mean, it makes sense.\n- It's a reasonable argument.\n- Yeah.\n- I've heard that one\nof the reasons that people\nthink that the clock\nis not exactly 24 hours,\nbut it's 24 hours plus or\nminus 20 minutes or so,\nis because we believe that we\nevolved in clans or groups,\nvillages, whatever, that\nwere about 100 to 200 people.\nAnd in order to have protection around\nthe early morning hours-\n- Interesting, same idea.\n- When we're vulnerable to predation\nand in the late night hours,\nthat you would want some\nindividuals of our species\nto be naturally more like night owls\nand some more like early people.\nSo your theory of parenting\nis similar in that way.\n- Right.\n- The social rhythm\nis a powerful rhythm though.\nMeaning if I go out and I'm tired,\nlet's say I'm tired at like 9:30.\nI don't want to go out, like I'm to need-\n- So can I just say something about that?\nI think the social rhythm is\npowerful at the obvious levels.\nLike it affects your sleep,\nit affects how much you wake up or eat,\nbut I'm not so sure it's\nas powerful as people think\non the clock.\nNow, eventually it will mess up the clock\nbecause now if you're doing\na lot of social at night,\ngetting enough light, eating\nat the wrong time of the day,\neventually you're going to have an effect,\nbut I don't think just the\nsocial interactions themselves\nhave been shown to affect\nyour clock very strongly\nfor some reason.\n- Yeah, that's good to know.\nWell, for people hearing this,\nthey're probably getting the impression\nlike I'm the night owl,\nand then Samer is the one\nthat's in bed at 9:00 and\nthen wakes up at 4:00.\nBut having attended many\nmeetings with Samer,\nI can tell you that he's the party animal.\nSo let's talk about that.\nI mean, let's talk about the\nfact that you're the partier,\nwho's up until 2:00 dancing\nat these various meetings,\nwhich I've seen.\n- Yep.\n- He's actually a good dancer I'm told,\nbut what should we do when\nwe do stay up very late,\nfor whatever reason;\ncould be because we had\nto take a midnight trip to the hospital,\nan unfortunate reason,\nor it could be because you're\nin the presence of people\nthat you don't see very\noften and you go out\nfor a really nice night out on\nthe town and you get to sleep\naround 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning.\nHow should one get back on schedule?\nDo you force yourself to\nthen get up and view light\nat the normal time that you\nwould get up and view light?\nOr do you allow yourself to sleep in?\nWhat what's the optimal protocol?\n- I would allow myself to sleep in,\nand remember this is a long-term effect.\nThis is something that you\nlive with for a long period.\nAnd remember I told you\nabout the experiments\nwe did with the mood,\nthese required two weeks\nof that light schedule\nto cause mood disturbances.\nSo these don't happen\njust in a single day.\n- So this is the way you\njustify staying out late\nevery once in a while.\n- Well, in the meetings\nyou've seen me in,\nI've done this for five\nor six days continuously,\nbut what you didn't see that\nwhen I came back to my home,\nit took me two weeks\nas if I did a jet lag.\nSo I really do suffer for two weeks\nafter doing a six crazy\nnight of staying up at night,\ndrinking at the wrong time of the day.\nSo it's not that I'm\ncompletely okay with it.\nWhen I go back, everything goes back.\nIt takes me actually\nliterally two weeks to recover\nfrom the circadian rhythm meeting\nthat you've seen me\npartying at some point.\n- Which is kind of ironic\nthat the circadian rhythm-\n- I know.\n- Meaning people are totally\ndisrupting their circadian cycle,\nbut scientists are human beings too.\n- Right, so I think if you do\nit at very little occasions,\nI think you should not worry too much\nthat this will have lasting impact.\nAnd the good news is that if\nyou readjust your schedule,\nyou could come back to it.\nThe problem is when you\nmaintain this wrong schedule\nfor a prolonged time\nand it becomes chronic,\nprolonged periods of time,\nthat's when you have the problems\nand the accumulation of the problems.\nSo when you have sleeping problem,\nyou produce metabolic problem.\nWhen you have metabolic problems,\nyou produce lack of exercise.\nAnd you could see how things\ncan spiral out very quickly.\nAnd then it would be\nhard to come back to it.\n- Well, certainly sleep disruption is both\na symptom of and-\n- Yes.\n- A cause of almost all-\n- Absolutely.\n- Mental health disorders.\n- Absolutely.\n- And certainly the metabolic syndromes\nthat people are talking about\nnowadays and all of this,\nit all funnels back to light.\nThis is what's so remarkable.\n- Eventually, yeah.\n- And so we have these devices,\nand I use my phone and I use my computer.\nBut do you think that the\nmere dimming of the screen\nor not interacting with screens,\nsay 90 minutes or two\nhours before bedtime,\naccording to what we're saying today,\nthis should have a profound effect\non all these factors.\n- And it does.\nAnd I really believe it does.\nAnd, again, I think as\nPat did these inventions\nwhere you get a pouch where\nyou put your phone in a pouch.\n- Mm hm, so, what Samer's\nreferring to is our friend, Pat,\nthis former Seal Team member,\nwho's also very impressive\nperson in the landscape\nof business and family, et cetera.\nA real superhuman by any\nregard has this habit of taking\nhis phone and putting\nit into a sealed pouch\nin the evening.\n- Yeah.\n- So it's basically walled off-\n- And in his program he sends you actually\nthese sealed pouches.\nAnd so that I think is a\ngreat idea because not only\nit will take away the light from you,\nbut it also take away the distraction\nbecause you want to repair and\nrecover, and sleep does that.\nAnd if you have your phone\ndinging all the time,\nor the light flashing from it,\nyou're just not getting enough sleep\nand you're causing\nyourself major problems.\n- I never asked you\nthis, but I realized now\nthat I should have long\nago, but I'll ask you now.\nWhy and how did you get\ninto all this stuff?\n- Yeah, I mean, honestly, first of all,\nI wanted to study genetics and I knew\nI wanted to do PhD in genetics.\nBut I only got accepted in\none university at the time.\nAnd I joined the Learning and Memory Lab.\nAnd I liked learning and\nmemory at the beginning,\nI worked on the snails\non Aplysia californica,\nand started looking at\nlearning and memory.\nBut then the same lab was\nlooking at these daily variation.\nI was really struck.\nLike you never think about\nit outside of science.\nIt's really struck me that organisms\ncan measure day biologically.\nThat was very shocking to me.\nAnd I just really got\nattracted and I wanted to see\nwhy does this happen?\nWhat is the effect of\ndifferent times of day?\nAnd I just stuck with it.\nIt just, it was mind blowing for me\nwho was in medical school,\nthat I've never heard about it before.\nYou know, it's really amazing medicine,\nI think still now we are very good\nat looking at stuff spatially,\nbut we're very bad at\nlooking at temporal aspects.\nSo we always like to see\nimages, static images,\nspatial information.\n- Right, take an x-ray,\nmeasure a temperature-\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- Measure a blood pressure.\n- But we don't think of temporal.\nAnd you talk to John Hogenesch right now,\nand he's telling you the\nimportance of chronomedicine\nor chromo pharma...\nWhatever the word is.\nAnd it really just getting the drugs\nat the right time of the\nday is going to be essential\nfor our health.\n- Do you think that's going to\ncome from using better trackers,\nlike Oura rings, WHOOP\nstraps, these kinds of things?\n- I love the trackers,\nbut I think there's even\nmore exciting discoveries.\nNow you could take a single blood sample\nand measure many biological components\nand figure where you are\nin the circadian clock.\nSomething that was very hard to do before.\nSo if you have a marker to know\nwhere you are in the clock,\nyou could actually understand\nmore the effect of everything;\nexercise, feeding, light input.\n- What is the marker?\n- So there are some papers\nfrom what's her name?\nPhyllis Zee and from Achim Kramer\nwhere they measure multiple RNAs\nthat are known to tell you\nwhat phase of the clock is,\nor multiple proteins or\nbiological reactions.\nAnd depending on a combination of factors,\nnot a single factor,\nyou could tell where you\nare in the circadian clock.\nSo they could instead of\njust measuring temperature\nor melatonin, just one measurement.\nAnd melatonin specifically, is\nalso complicated by the fact\nthat melatonin is affected by light.\nAnd temperature, your\ntemperature and sleep can be\neasily dissociable, right?\nWhen you travel up those\ndifferent timezone,\nyou sleep at different times\nin the temperature cycle.\nSo having multiple components\nmeasured will give you\na better determination\nof your circadian phase,\nand understanding your\ncircadian phase in humans\nwill telling you what is the\neffect of giving certain drugs\nat certain times of the circadian phase.\nSo, in the future, this\nis going to be studied\nat a much higher level when\nyou can determine the phase\nin relation to all the other stuff.\n- It's striking to me that in\nall animals, besides humans,\nif they deviate too much\nfrom the appropriate exposure\nto light and light-dark cycle,\nthey essentially don't mate and/or die\nand/or get killed off.\nBut in humans, we are able\nto override that at least\nto some extent, but the ways\nin which we suffer appear to be\nthings like obesity, metabolic syndromes,\nreproductive syndromes that are accompany\nthe other syndromes, you\nknow, endocrine syndromes,\nand mood and depressive disorders.\nIs there any effort at the\nlevel of the nationally\nor laboratories that you're aware of\nto try and use light in order\nto improve mood and mental health?\n- I mean, honestly, this is my mantra.\nThis is the thing that I think people,\nbecause I say, don't take\na pill, take a photon.\nAnd not, I mean, you take pills.\nThat's important.\nI'm just making it that\nreally we have an opportunity\nright now with the incredible\nadvances of LED lights,\nof changing spectrum of light,\nof regulating intensities.\nAnd just for simple changes,\nyou could really improve\nsleep-wake cycle, productivity,\nand still you could actually get more done\nbecause as we've talked about,\nwhen you have all these messed up,\nnow you have to sleep more,\nbut your sleep is fragmented.\nIt's not very good.\n- And you can't focus\nwhen you do sit down-\n- And you can't focus or\nyou don't have alertness\nwhen you need the alertness.\nSo having all these could allow\nyou to do even more actually\nat the end than less.\nAnd that's the exciting part it.\n- One of the questions I\nget asked most often about\nis about ADHD.\nI think there's a lot of self-prescribed\nas well as clinically prescribed ADHD.\nPeople are having a tremendously\ndifficult time focusing\nand not just because they're sleepy,\nthey just can't seem to\nanchor their attention.\nAnd there could be\nmultiple reasons for this,\nbut there are now several\nclinical trials ongoing\nusing light to try and anchor\npeople's attention and mood\nand wellbeing for sake of focus.\nAnd I think that while I love this saying\nthat you mentioned, \"Take\na photon, not a pill.\"\nAnd with due respect to\nthe need for pharmacology\nfor some certain people,\nI think most people just\nhaven't really dialed in\ntheir relationship to light\nin a way that allows them\nto rule out whether or\nnot they need medication.\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\nThat's the best way to put it.\nI can't add to that.\n- Let's talk about jet lag.\n- Mm hm.\n- But not in the context of,\nokay, if somebody's traveling\nfrom Europe to Japan\nor from the east coast,\nbecause that varies tremendously, right?\nI mean, there's as many\ndifferent variations\non travel as there are\nindividuals out there with roles-\n- Right.\n- And jobs, et cetera.\nBut rather, let's talk\nabout what are the two\nor three things that people can do\nto adjust their schedule quickly?\nYesterday, I called you and said,\n\"Look, I know somebody\nwho's traveling six hours.\nI won't even mention in which direction,\n'cause I don't want people\nto anchor to that example.\nAnd you described some very\nsimple tools of viewing light\na little bit earlier than normal\nand getting on the local\nfood schedule, et cetera,\nthat would allow them\nto shift more quickly.\n- Exactly.\n- And the reason I want to\nhave this conversation is\nyes, for the travelers,\nand for the shift workers,\nbut mostly because of the\nfact that you've proven\nagain and again that people are disrupted\nin their circadian behavior at home.\nSo, aside from what we've\nalready talked about,\nhow can one adjust\nquickly to a new schedule?\nLike let's say, fall classes are starting,\nyou start a new job or you have a baby\nor a puppy or whatever,\nwhat is the best way\nto shift the clock quickly?\n- So, it's very simple as\nwe've talked yesterday.\nSo imagine you're in the outside\nwith no industrial light.\nIf your body thinks\nyou're in early evening\nand you see a bright light,\nwhat does this tell you?\nOh, wait, this is not early evening yet.\nIt's still early afternoon\nor late afternoon.\nSo I have to delay my clock\nto go back to late afternoon.\nSo if you get light early in the evening,\nit delays your clock.\nSo what does that-\n- Meaning that makes you\nwant to go to sleep later?\n- Yes, it delays your clock.\nSo, you're in New York, right?\nPeople in Italy have an advanced clock\nbecause they are six hours ahead of us.\nSo if you're in New York\nand you get light early\nin the evening, you delay\neven further from Italy.\nSo now you're delaying away from Italy.\nNow the same thing happens.\nLet's say, you thought dawn came up\nand you thought it's already dawn,\nbut it was let's say three\no'clock in the morning\nor four o'clock in the morning.\nAnd then you get to\nbright light and you say,\n\"Oh, wait a minute.\nDawn is not the up yet.\"\nSo I should advance my clock.\nOr I'm at night, but I'm\ngetting bright lights,\nso I should run because\ndawn is already up.\nSo then later in the\nnight, later in your night,\nand actually it just\nhappens that in humans\nyou get a temperature\nnadir later in the night,\nlow temperature in your body.\nAfter that, lights start\nadvancing your clock.\nSo if you want to go to Italy,\ninstead of getting light\nearly in the evening,\nyou want to get light\nafter the temperature low.\nSo you could advance your clock\neven before you go to Italy,\nand you're catching up to the\nItalians just by using light.\nIt's as simple as that.\n- Great.\n- So you could do it for every region.\nYou could calculate how much\nthey are advanced of you.\nYou could know how much these\nlight shifts happen per day,\nand you can calculate what you need to do,\nvery simple math, to adjust\neither in direction of delaying\nif you're going from\nNew York to California,\nyou want to delay your clock\nor advancing if you're going\nfrom New York to Italy.\n- So, in order to make that a visual\nand because a lot of people\nare listening to this,\nnot looking at it on video,\nwe will put a zero cost\ndownloadable figure of this\non the HubermanLab.com website\nrelated to this episode.\nBut I think I can summarize\nit in language as well.\nIf I understand correctly,\nwhat you're saying is if\nyour typical wake up time\nis say, 7:00 a.m., then your\nlow point in temperature\nprobably occurs somewhere\naround 5:00 a.m..\n- Yeah.\n- And if you view light\nright around then it's\ngoing to essentially\nadvance your clock.\n- Yeah.\nBecause then your body thinks,\noh, it's seven o'clock,\nso advanced your clock\nby one to two hours.\n- But if I were to view\nlight, say at 3:00 a.m.,\nthen it would probably delay my clock?\n- Yeah.\n- Okay.\nYeah, so, and then let's say\nI land in a new schedule.\nI want to adjust to a new schedule.\nLet's say I didn't manage to do anything\nwith my light viewing before I went.\nAnd I didn't anticipate the trip.\nSuddenly I'm on a new schedule, okay?\nI was told that one of the\nways to help shift the clock\nand to avoid gastrointestinal issues\nis to eat on the local schedule.\n- Mm hm.\n- To start basically behaving\nlike a local.\n- Mm hm.\n- Even though your\ncircadian clock will take\na little bit of time to catch up.\n- Right, absolutely.\nBut you have to remember the light, right?\nSo, now that we explained it very simply,\nlet's take a very simple example, right?\nNew York to Italy,\nthat's a simple example.\nNew York time, Italy time,\nsix hour difference, right?\nSo let's say you fly\nfrom New York at night.\nYou reach Italy at eight\no'clock in the morning.\nWhat is the time in your\nNew York time although you-\n- Six hours back.\n- Six hours back.\n- It's 2:00 in the morning.\n- It's 2:00 a.m..\nSo when you land Italy,\nyou want to avoid light like the plague.\nYeah, you could eat,\nbut you really don't\nwant to get the light.\n- Right, 'cause otherwise\nit's going to delay you.\n- It's going to delay you, it's\ngoing to send you to California\ninstead of sending you to Italy.\n- Right, and so this is such a key point.\nIf anyone's confused about this,\nwe will put some diagrams up.\nBut what Samer is saying is so crucial.\nJust because getting\nbright light in your eyes\nearly in the day is really\nbeneficial when you're at home,\nwhen you travel to a new time zone,\nyou have to take into account\nwhat your body thinks.\nExcuse me, you have to\ntake into account where\nyour body thinks you are.\n- Exactly.\n- And so if you're looking\nat the Italian sunrise,\nhaving just flown from New York to Italy\nand you didn't prepare\nfor that trip by waking up\na little bit earlier in anticipation-\n- Multiple days, yeah.\n- And you view light\nat 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. Italian time,\nbeautiful Italian sunrise,\nyou are going to delay your clock.\nYou're going to basically throw\nyourself back to California,\nbut you are in Italy.\nYou're going to throw your\nbiology back to California\nand you are going to be up in\nthe middle of the Italian night.\nAnd you're going to be miserable-\n- Miserable.\n- I'll tell a brief anecdote\n'cause I called Samer in desperation.\nA few years ago, I traveled to Abu Dhabi,\nNYU Abu Dhabi to give a\nseminar, 12 hours out of phase.\nIt's a 12 hour flip.\nAnd I thought I could just muscle it.\nI thought I'll get up, just view sunlight\nwhen the sun comes up and I fell apart\nmentally and physically.\nAnd Samer came to my rescue.\nI called him, I said, \"I\ndon't know what to do.\"\nAnd he said, \"Go to the\ngym at the local dawn,\nworkout, eat and then view\nsunlight starting the next day.\"\nAnd that basically got me on the schedule.\nSo I used food and\nexercise to adjust myself\nbecause my light viewing activity\nwas just completely out of whack.\n- Yeah, I mean, and we\ntalked about other details,\nso you have to calculate it,\nbut you're absolutely right.\nI mean, it's very\nimportant to avoid getting\nthe wrong light information\nwhen you're trying\nto adjust your body because\notherwise it shifts you\nto the other cycle, absolutely right.\n- Well, you are one of these\npeople that has such vigor.\nIt's one of these things\nwhere having known you\nall these years, you have a\ntremendous capacity for work\nand for soccer, and for\narguing, respectful arguing.\nAnd sometimes, you know-\n- It's getting worse with age.\n- Yeah, well, we could\ntalk about that offline,\nbut I think a lot of your\nvigor and a lot of your ability\nto work hard and focus and\nreally do so many things\nat an impressive level is\nbecause you think about\nthese issues and you think about\nwhen you're going to be optimal for focus,\nwhen you're going to be\noptimal for exercise,\nand the when is the key.\n- Right.\n- And I think a lot of\npeople live in the landscape\nof feeling like there's\nsomething broken inside them\nbecause they can't focus-\n- It's subconscious.\n- Or they get too-\n- It's subconscious, right?\nRemember it's all subconscious.\nThese effects and, Andrew,\nyou're absolutely right.\nNow, honestly, joking aside about age,\nI really agree with you that\nI think part of the reason\nI'm continuing to be able to do this,\nthat I really think about it.\nAnd I make sure that I\nkeep everything aligned.\nAnd that actually helps me a lot.\nLike I don't suffer in sleep.\nI don't suffer in waking up.\nI never use a timer to wake up.\nI mean, people say, aren't you scared?\nLike you have to give a\nlecture at 8:00 or 7:30.\nHonestly, I was like, there is no way\nI'm going to go beyond that.\nIt just, even if I try,\nI can't sleep beyond 6:00\na.m. in my regular times,\nit's just, it's not going to happen.\nBy 4:30 my eyes are wide\nawake and I'm in bed.\nIt's just system is so aligned, it works.\n- A lot of times people will\nsay, how come I go to sleep,\nI fall asleep fine, but then\nI wake up at 3:00 or 4:00\nin the morning and can't fall back asleep.\nIs it possible that those\npeople were supposed\nto go to bed at 8:00 p.m.?\n- It's possible.\nI mean, it is possible.\nIt is also possible that\nsometimes people will wake up\nand go back to sleep.\nBut yeah, I mean, it is possible.\nOr it's possible that their\nclock is completely misaligned,\nthat they are getting\nmaybe a nap time at night\nwhen they are supposed...\nAnd then they possibly\nfeel so sleepy in the day.\nSo, all these are possible combination.\n- Well, that's an interesting\nidea I hadn't considered.\nSo, that what they think is their sleep,\ntheir body is so out of whack\nwith the light-dark cycle,\nthat it's actually a nap.\n- A nap.\nOr the weaker part of the sleep.\nI mean, you see this when you traveled\nto different time zone before you adjust.\nYou go to sleep really well,\nbut two hours later, you're fully up.\nTwo hours.\nIf you were so tired and\nthis is your regular sleep,\nthere's no way you're going\nto wake up in two hours.\nSo, then you feel very\nsleepy later in the day\nor something like that.\nSo it depends of how your whole system\nis aligned to the environment.\n- That's a very interesting idea.\nI think that's going to\nresonate with a lot of people.\nI wake up every morning\naround 3:00 or 4:00,\nI generally use the bathroom\nand then I fall back asleep very deeply.\nIt doesn't seem to disrupt\nmy daytime wakefulness.\nAnd I think a lot of people\nobsess over that waking up\nand worry there's something wrong.\n- Absolutely.\n- Provided they can go back\nto sleep it's okay.\n- Exactly.\nIf you can go use the\nbathroom, go back to sleep,\nthat should not be a problem.\nMaybe with some people, when\nthey go to use the bathroom,\nthey use very bright light and then\nthey get an alerting signal.\nSo, maybe it could be as simple\nas that, that affects you.\nMaybe when you wake up,\nyou put tons of light\nor you start reading your iPad.\nSo there's all these combination\nthat we still don't know\nabout that could be affecting\ntheir sleep-wake rhythms\nand their sleep maintenance.\n- Do you take melatonin?\n- I don't need it to be honest.\nIn my case, there is no reason to use it\nbecause I could guarantee you\nthat by maybe eight o'clock,\nmy melatonin has already started to go up.\nAnd by the time I sleep,\nmy melatonin is very high\nbecause I don't use a lot\nof lights after sunset.\n- And light inhibits melatonin release.\n- And light really blocks melatonin level.\n- You hear this myth that\nthe pineal gland calcifies\nas we get older.\nDo you know anything about that?\n- I mean, I've heard about\nthat, but I don't know...\nI mean, there is not very clear evidence\nthat it affects the sleep.\nI don't know much about it, to be honest.\n- Yeah, the evidence that\nI've seen is that yes,\nthere's some calcification\naround the pineal,\njust because of where\nit sits in the brain.\nIt's close to some bony structures.\n- I see.\n- But I don't think\nthere's any evidence that\nit has negative effects.\n- I mean, if you still have,\nyou could measure melatonin\nand that should tell you\nif it has any, it's such\nan easy thing to do.\n- Yeah, I think this is more\nof a internet wellness thing\nthat got outside the cage.\n- That's possible.\nI think you're absolutely right.\n- Yeah, it sounds terrible, calcification\nof the thing, right?\n- Yeah, exactly.\nLike the heart thing, right?\n- Yeah, exactly.\nLet's talk about seasonality a little bit.\nI learned, and I don't\nknow if this is still true,\nbut that most suicides occur\nin April, in the spring.\nI think there's a poem that says,\n\"April is the cruelest month,\"\nI think as the poem begins.\nAre there data that\nsuicides are more frequent\nat particular times of year?\nAnd if so, is the spring\nthat time of year?\n- Yeah, a lot of people talk about this.\nAnd one of the hypothesis\nis that the winter month\nthat are very bad for mood,\nmake people not wanting to do anything.\nAnd they get into such\ndeep level of depression\nthat when the sun comes up,\nthey get actually the energy\nto act on their depression,\nwhich sounds really terrible.\nAnd it's just terrible.\n- Sounds just terrible.\nIt's terrible.\n- So that's the idea\nthat the lack of light\nthroughout the winter\ncaused them to go into such depression\nthat they don't feel like doing anything.\nThen when the light comes\nin with rigor in the spring,\nit gives them that after all\nthe depression they suffered,\nit gives them that push to take\nthat sad, final act I guess.\n- What other seasonal effects have been\ndemonstrated in humans?\n- Yeah, I mean, I think in\nhumans, it's not very clear\nbecause we don't think about seasonality,\nbut if you start thinking about us,\nI think we go through\nmajor seasonal changes.\nI really do.\nI think our eating pattern\nchanged across the year.\nI could tell you that\nme thinking about this,\nthere is a clear changes that\nhappens to me across the year.\nBut for animals, this is really essential\nbecause for animals they have\nto time their mating behavior\nwas when they deliver their\nprogeny in the most abundant\namount of food and artificial light\nis causing major disruption.\nBecause if you change\nthe way these animals\nare receiving the light information,\nthey either start mating\nmuch earlier or much later\nand their numbers dwindle.\nAnd they get into the\ndangers of really completely\ngetting eliminated or extinct.\n- Well, human birth rates\nare definitely going down.\n- Right, in some-\n- I mean, in the US\nin particular, yeah.\n- In some areas, not others.\n- Not others, right.\nBut are there other effects\nof seasonality on humans\nthat we are aware of?\n- Honestly, you could see it perfectly,\nI think, in Scandinavia,\nI mean, you could talk\nto people who live in-\n- Sure, they get seasonal depression.\n- Well, seasonal depression is one,\nbut actually when you start\nasking them questions,\nthey tell you like in the winter\nthey barely could wake up.\nThey barely have the energy,\nbefore even depression.\nEven people who don't\nget seasonal depression,\nthey will tell you our\nenergy level is lower.\nOur ability to go to work is not the same.\nAnd in the summer, most people\nactually sleep very little.\nThey tell you, we really\ncan feel like we're manic,\nwe have all this energy\nand not in a negative way,\nin a funny way, right?\nI mean, but if we want to sleep,\nwe have to put this curtain.\nAnd I think in these situations,\nyou could really appreciate\nthe seasonality of humans.\nI think we kind of\ndestroyed our seasonality\nbecause we don't get exposed\nto that much natural light.\nWe have all this artificial\nlight, but I think honestly,\none of the thing that is going to happen\nif they follow your\nrecommendations about giving light\nat the same time, giving\nfood, giving exercise-\n- Wait, let's be clear, those\nare your recommendations.\n- Well, I mean-\n- No, I mean just\nin fair attribution.\n- What I'm saying is that\nthis is going to cause them\nto also experience some\nchanges across the season,\nbecause now they're going\nto see the sun differently.\nIf you're going to go out in\nthe morning in the summer,\nyou're going to get a much brighter...\nThat's why I don't like\nthe change in time.\nI know people think, oh,\nbecause you're biased,\n'cause I think-\n- Wait, wait, wait, wait.\nSorry, the change in time,\nare you talking about daylight savings?\n- Daylight savings.\nIt's such a bad idea because it disrupts\nthat rhythm that you're having.\n'Cause I think your body,\nif you keep that rhythm,\nyou will see the whole seasonality.\nAnd I look at it from a different\naspect than other people.\nAnd people say I'm biased\nbecause I'm a morning person,\nand it may be true, but\nthere are situation-\n- Secret conspiracy about morning people.\n- Yeah, but if you think about it, Andrew,\nthere is a situation\nwhere you're getting light\nperfectly well and then all of a sudden\nthey delayed by one hour because...\nAnd then even though it's the summer,\nyour body now, if you're\nstill not adjusting think,\n\"Oh wait, what happened?\nWhat kind of happened?\"\n- Well, I'm glad you're bringing this up\nbecause I always thought\nwhat's the big deal, one hour?\nRight, one hour shift.\nSpring forward, fall back.\n- It's so hard to adjust\nto one hour actually.\n- But this goes back to the\nbeginning of our discussion.\nIt's not just one hour.\n- Right.\n- Because it's one hour\nacross that one day.\n- Right.\n- But there's this cumulative\neffect on the clock and\nthese three elements\nof your tripartite model.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- Right, the homeostatic,\nsleep and the light,\ndirect effects on mood.\n- Exactly and when\nit's so close, it's\nsometimes hard to figure out\nhow to adjust it perfectly because\nwe're already sleep\ndeprived in our society.\nAnd then you shift it by...\nSo it just, it all accumulates\nand it has no benefit.\n- Well, you work at a major\ngovernment organization,\nNational Institute of Mental Health.\n- Yeah.\n- Why don't we campaign for-\n- Honestly, I have no idea.\nI mean, it makes no sense.\n- No, I'm saying why don't we go campaign?\n- Yeah, I would love to.\nI mean, it makes no sense\nto have the summer light\ngoes up at 9:00 p.m.,\nthe light goes down where I\nlive in Baltimore at 9:00 p.m.\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nwhen you really want to see\nthe light longer in the day,\nyou now shift the other way.\nAnd now it goes all of\na sudden at 6:00 p.m..\nWhy do you do these drastic changes?\nLet it blend across the\nwhole season, you know?\nYes, later, earlier at night,\nbut it's at least consistent.\nIt goes in a very consistent manner.\nI just don't understand why they do this.\nIt makes no sense.\n- Well, I think that the reason they do it\nis because they don't\nunderstand the biology.\n- Exactly, absolutely.\n- Because one hour seems\ntrivial unless you understand-\n- It's not.\n- That the repercussions\nof that one hour shift,\nbecause what's also clear now\nbased on what you're saying,\nis that that one hour shift\ntaking you out of alignment\nwith the natural light-dark cycle\nin exactly the wrong direction.\n- It's pushing people to get even later.\n- Yeah.\n- In the summer,\nwhen light is going to\npush you later anyway.\nIt doesn't make sense.\nYou put it beautifully, I just\nrambled and this is really-\n- No, no, you made it clear.\n- I mean, it's like\nliterally it it made people\nwho are having problem having\nan advanced sleep rhythm\nbecause they are delayed,\nnow you give them this hour to\nmake them even more delayed.\nYou push them even later\nin the day-night cycle.\nIt just doesn't make sense at all.\n- I think 2022 should be the year that we\nabolish daylight savings.\n- Oh, man.\nThat would be the day for me honestly.\n- Well, also, if it has a positive effect\non what is essentially an\nepidemic of mental health issues\nand other issues related\nto improper interactions\nwith light, that I think\nis a well worthwhile cause,\nand we can explore it.\n- Absolutely, absolutely.\n- [Andrew] So for once we're\ngoing to fight with another group.\n- Common, I would do to do that.\n- [Andrew] A common battle as\nopposed to with one another.\n- I mean, the circadian people honestly,\nto give them credit, have\nbeen trying for years\nto abolish daylight saving.\n- Yeah, the problem is they\nall go to sleep at 9:00 p.m.\nand wake up at 4:00 a.m.,\nso we never see them.\n- That's right, that's right.\n- No, the circadian community\nhas done an amazing job\nof figuring out what we need.\n- Right.\n- And then the challenge of course,\nis making sure that\npeople get what they need.\n- Right.\n- And making sure\nthat at a societal level,\nwe're not vaulting ourselves\ninto the wrong direction.\n- And the biggest problem\nis that the late waking\npeople, they think that really,\nand I'm going to try to\nput it in a better way now,\nthey think, oh, because\nyou're a morning person,\nyou want to see the sun early.\nSo you want me to suffer it dropping late,\nbut that's not the case.\nBecause what happens is\nwhen they shift it back\nafter the daylight saving,\nnow they're going to make\nyou suffer really badly\nbecause now it's going to be earlier.\n- Right, in the fall.\n- In the fall when there\nis not enough light.\n- Yeah, that's right.\n- And they keep it the same way.\nSo to try to convince them\nthat actually this at the end\ncauses more trouble\nwhen you need the light\nfor your late schedule in the fall,\nwhen they shift it back.\nThen they say, keep it\ndaylight saving all the time.\nAnd that has been proven\nthat it's very bad.\nLike people have done studies\nthat literally two areas\nclose to each others and\nareas that were the whole year\non daylight saving has much more problems\neven in cancer rates and depression.\nSo you don't want to do that.\nSo that's what trying to convince people\nthat you need to prevent that switch,\nand you don't need daylight saving at all.\nThat's where the problem happens.\n- Interesting.\nI had not thought about that, but yes,\nyou late risers that in the\nfall, when it's the fall back,\nas they say, spring forward, fall back,\nyou dial back the clock,\nit's really compounding the problem\nthat already exists.\n- Exactly.\nAnd it's really nice if you think,\nif you keep it consistent in the spring,\nyou get the equinox and then\nthe day starts going up,\nand then even in the\nsummer it start going down,\nand then the fall you get the\nother equinox and go back.\nSo it's very symmetrical, right?\nIt goes into short day,\nlonger, long, long, long, long,\nand then short day again.\nBut now you're getting\nthese bumps in both sides\nof the spring and fall.\nWhy would you do that?\nSomething that is beautifully symmetrical,\nbeautifully smooth, you're\nputting bumps into it.\n- Well, and not just\nbeautiful because it's there,\nbut it evolved.\nI mean, essentially this is the system-\n- It's natural.\n- We evolved in for hundreds\nof thousands of years.\n- This is the seasonality.\nThe most even apart\nfrom the exact equator,\nevery part of the earth has seasonality.\n- I want to briefly touch\non something which is\nindividual and genetic variation\nin the sensitivity to light.\n- Yeah.\n- So not chronotype, but first of all,\na very basic question.\nDo people with light\neyes, light colored eyes,\nare they more sensitive\nto light than people\nwith darker pigmented eyes?\n- I mean, honestly, it makes\nsense they will be more\nbecause if you think of my dark pupil,\nit's blocking more light.\nSo, if you have light pupil,\nyes, for vision, it may\nnot be very obvious,\nbut for something that is\nmeasuring the amount of light,\nyou're getting more light than me.\nSo you would probably need\nless light to be effective\nas somebody who's darker.\nAnd that maybe could explain\nwhy sometimes lighter people\nsay, I don't want to go\ninto very bright conditions\nbecause it's really bright.\n- Yeah, I can't even\nbe at a cafe with one of\nthese reflective tables,\nlike a metal table.\n- Right.\n- Unless I have very dark sunglasses on.\n- Exactly.\n- It's so bright\nit's painful for me.\n- Right, right.\n- Whereas some people like\nyou, we've sat outside\nand had meals and you're like fine.\nI assumed it was kind of\nJordanian toughness versus-\n- No, no, no, it's really\nthe pupil blocks more light.\nSo I think it is possible that\nit's as simple as the pupil\nblocking more light can have sensitivity,\nbut your question is also goes deeper.\nAre there more sensitivity differences?\nAnd my understanding would be\nI would think that it may be,\ndepends on how effective your cells\nare in responding to light,\nhow healthy your ipRCGs are.\nBut there's not many studies to show that.\nWhat is really clear that is happening\nis that patients with bipolar,\nthey seem to have different\nsensitivities to light.\nSo it seems that at least people\nwho have psychological changes,\nthey may have differences to\nthe sensitivity of light, so.\n- Are those differences\nin a particular direction?\n- I don't remember the exact data.\n- We can look it up, yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- And people have heard\nme say this at nauseum\nto the point where they\nactually roll their eyes,\nbut that these are the\nonly two pieces of brain,\nI'm pointing to my eyes, folks,\nthat are outside the cranial vault.\n- Absolutely.\n- They are two pieces of brain\nthat it basically inform\nthe brain about whether\nor not to be alert or asleep.\n- Absolutely.\n- But you can imagine that\nthose two little pieces of brain\nthat we call eyes would\nhave genetic variations.\n- Right.\n- Of course eye color\nis genetically determined,\nthat there would be\ngenetic variations based on\nwhether or not your ancestry\nevolved near the equator\nor further from the equator, right?\nI mean, you see more\nblue eyes in Scandinavia,\nthan you do at the equator.\n- Absolutely, I mean,\nit's the lack of light that\nsaid you need less inhibition\nbecause there's not enough light, right?\nSo that's the idea of the changing color.\nSo, yeah, I totally agree with you.\nI mean, I think this is an\narea that will be studied later\nand will be empirically determined.\nThe problem we have in\nthis field right now,\nwhich I think is the biggest problem,\nis we don't have a way\nto measure the ipRCGs\nsensitivities in humans.\nSo we still like, it's easy to measure\nyour rod cone function if\nyou go to an optometrist,\nthey measure all the details, right?\nContrast detection.\n- You look at the chart,\nyou get out the Snellen Chart.\n- Yeah, exactly.\n- You look at the letters of the DMV.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- But for the non subconscious,\nwe still don't have a good\nmeasuring systems to figure out\nwhat is Andrew's sensitivity?\nWhat is Samer's sensitivity?\nWhat is this person's sensitivity?\nAnd I think we're starting to\nwork on something like that\nto hopefully develop these techniques.\nBut till we develop them,\nit's going to be very hard to figure out\nif there is a sensitivity difference?\nHow do they relate?\nAnd on men and woman?\nDark and light?\nAnd all that, normal versus\npsychologically affect,\nand stuff like that.\n- Fascinating.\nAnd every time you talk, I learn so much.\nIt's in the best way, the\nbest sense of the term,\nit's a waterfall of knowledge.\nAs a final question,\nI have a question about\nsensitivity of a whole other kind,\nand that's the sensitivity to spicy food.\nNow, the reason I'm asking this question,\nwhat seemingly out of the blue\nis that I made the mistake\nonce of having Samer cook for me.\nAnd I said, \"Not too spicy.\"\nAnd he said, \"Okay, not too spicy.\"\nHe actually said, \"Okay, not too spicy.\"\nAnd it almost killed me.\nLike it was like two or three days.\nSo you know a lot about biology\noutside the visual system,\nlight, et cetera.\nYou've been around a while.\nAre there known genetic\nor inherited of any kind\nsensitivities to spicy food?\nTo things like red peppers and capsaicin?\nBecause what you call mild, my friend,\nalmost put me into the hospital.\n- I think this is similar\nto you swimming in the ocean\nand I need to go develop\nthe pain tolerance to do it.\n- Okay, true, true, I\nlike cold water swims\nand Samer's not a fan.\n- Yeah.\n- But that's going to change.\nIt's adaptable.\n- These are adaptable.\n- That's going to change.\n- That's my belief.\nBefore I met Rejji, I was like you.\nAnd once I started eating\na lot of spicy food,\nI lost touch of how spicy my food is.\nSo I nearly killed you, Andrew,\nand I apologize for that.\n- I forgive you.\nSo, basically what you're\nsaying is that marriage\ntoughened you up?\n- Toughened me up, exactly.\n- [Andrew] Maybe that's the solution.\n- That's what you need, yeah.\n- Samer, this has been an amazing march\nthrough the importance of light,\nnot just for regulating\nsleep and wakefulness,\nbut also for food timing,\nthe interactions with mood,\nthe interactions with exercise.\nI'm certain that people are\ngoing to start thinking about\nhow to change their\nrelationship with light\nas a way to anchor\neverything that they do.\nAnd that's important to their health.\nAnd I just on behalf of all of them,\nand just directly from me as your friend\nand as a colleague for many\nyears now, I just want to say,\nthank you for the\nincredible work you're doing\nand for sharing it with us.\n- Thank you so much.\nAnd I actually now thinking\nabout all of this, and you said,\nI should write a book.\nI should write a book and call\nit \"The Tripartite Model.\"\nI think that would put all\nthese components together,\nit would be very interesting\nto do at some point.\n- You should write a book.\nThey'll probably try and\nchange the title to like,\n\"Food, Mood and You,\" or something.\nBut you can put in little\nprint The Tripartite Model\nor whatever, but regardless\nof what it's called,\nyou absolutely should write a book.\nAnd so if you'd like\nSamer to write a book,\nor if you'd like to learn more about him,\nlet's talk a little bit about\nwhere people can find you.\nYour laboratory is at\nthe National Institutes\nof Mental Health.\nHe is Head of the Chronobiology Unit,\nall these things as\nI've mentioned earlier,\nbut you are active on\nTwitter and Instagram.\n- Right.\n- So, what is your\nTwitter handle?\n- It's @SamerHattar.\n- And we will provide a link\nfor that in the show notes.\n- Yes, the Twitter @SamerHattar,\nand I think the same for Instagram.\nYeah, actually.\n- And Samer has been\ncoaxed onto
