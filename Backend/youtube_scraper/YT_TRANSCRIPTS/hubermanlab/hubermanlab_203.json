    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are talking all\nabout food and the brain.\nWe are going to talk about\nfoods that are good for your\nbrain in terms of focus,\nin terms of brain health generally,\nand the longevity of your brain,\nyour ability to maintain cognition\nand clear thinking over time.\nWe are also going to talk about why\nand how you prefer\ncertain foods to others.\nAnd I'm going to talk about\nthe three major signals\nthat combine to drive your food choices.\nI'll give you a little\nhint of what those are.\nOne of those signals comes from your gut\nand is completely subconscious.\nThis is not the gut microbiome, per se.\nThese are neurons in your gut\nthat are sending signals to your brain\nthat you are unaware of\nabout the nutrient contents of\nthe foods that you're eating.\nThe second signal is\nhow metabolically\naccessible a given food is,\nmeaning how readily that food\ncan be converted into\nenergy that your brain,\nnot your body,\nbut that your brain can use.\nAnd the third signal is perhaps\nthe most interesting one.\nIt's the signal of belief.\nIt's the signal of what you perceive\nand believe the food that\nyou're eating to contain,\nand what you think it can\ndo for you health-wise\nand energy-wise.\nAnd that might sound a\nlittle wishy-washy or vague,\nbut we're going to\nprovide mechanistic data\nto support the fact that\nyou can change what you eat\nso much so that you can drive your brain\nand your body to crave\nfoods that are good for you,\nor at least better for you\nthan the foods you might\ncurrently be eating.\nThis is an incredibly powerful\nmechanism that we all have.\nIt's one that I think is\nvery underappreciated.\nAnd today, I'm going to review the data\nfrom both animal models,\nand fortunately, more\nrecently, human studies,\nthat really do underscore the fact\nthat you can control your\ndesire for particular foods.\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\nI just want to briefly touch on\nsome key takeaways from\na previous episode,\nwhich is the episode on\ntime restricted feeding,\nalso called intermittent fasting.\nThe key elements of\ntime restricted feeding\nthat will benefit your health the most,\nin terms of weight loss or maintenance,\nfat loss, organ health,\nquality sleep, and cognition,\nare that the feeding window begin\nat least one hour after waking.\nYou could push that feeding\nwindow out to begin later,\nbut at least one hour after waking.\nAnd that it end at least two,\nand ideally, three hours\nbefore going to sleep.\nSome people can end that feeding window\nmuch further away from\nthe beginning of sleep,\nmeaning they're finishing\ntheir last bite of food,\nfor instance, at 6:00 PM,\nand they're not going\nto sleep until midnight.\nBut many people struggle\nto get quality sleep\nif that feeding window is set too early\nrelative to when they go to sleep.\nSo begin the feeding window at\nleast one hour after waking.\nEnd the feeding window\nat least two hours before going to sleep.\nAnd a key feature based on\nthe scientific research,\nis that the feeding window itself\nfall more or less at the same\nperiod of each 24 hour day\nfrom day to day.\nMeaning, if you are going to\neat over an eight hour period,\nthat's your feeding window,\nyou wouldn't want to\nstart that feeding window\nat 10:00 AM one day and end it at 6:00 PM,\nand then the next day, start\nat noon and end it at 8:00 PM,\nand the next day, start it at 2:00 PM\nand end it at 10:00 PM, and so forth.\nAs much as is reasonably possible,\nif you want to extract the maximum\nbenefit from time restricted feeding,\nthe idea is to keep\nthat feeding window at,\nmore or less, the same\nphase, as it's called,\nof each 24 hour day.\nIf it slides around a little\nbit for social reasons\nor whatever reasons,\nit doesn't seem to be a big deal,\nbut you don't want it sliding around\nby many hours from day to day,\nbecause of the way that\nthat feeding window\nimpacts other genes called clock genes\nthat regulate a bunch of\nother processes in the body.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero\ncost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses\nand sunglasses that are\nof the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a career working\non the visual system,\nand one of the key problems\nthat ROKA sunglasses has solved is,\nif you've ever worn sunglasses,\nand you've gone from a\nvery bright region to, say,\na region with shadows,\noftentimes, you have to\ntake the sunglasses off.\nThey've designed their\nsunglasses in a way,\nthat no matter whether\nyou're standing in the shade\nor in bright sunlight,\nyou always see things with\nabsolute crystal clarity,\nwhich is wonderful.\nTheir eyeglasses as well are designed\nso that you can move from\none region of brightness to another\nwithout noticing it at all.\nThe other thing that's really terrific\nabout ROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses,\nis that they are very lightweight.\nMost of the time,\nyou don't even remember\nthat they're on your face.\nAnd you can wear them\nwhether or not you're\nexercising or working,\nbecause they won't slip\noff, even if you get sweaty.\nThe other thing that's really wonderful,\nis that the aesthetic is terrific.\nUnlike a lot of so-called\nperformance glasses out there\nthat make people look like cyborgs,\nor frankly, just look rather strange,\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nhave a terrific aesthetic.\nYou could wear them to dinner,\nto work, running, exercising,\nand they'll work for all those situations.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA,\nyou can go to ROKA.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code: Huberman\nto save 20% on your first order.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink\nthat's designed to cover your\nfoundational supplementation\nand health needs.\nI've been using Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nso I'm delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\nusing Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still drink\nAthletic Greens once or twice per day,\nis because it covers all of my\nvitamin mineral basic needs,\nand because of the probiotics.\nThere's now ample data supporting the fact\nthat probiotics support\na healthy gut microbiome,\nand that the gut microbiome is important\nfor keeping inflammation\nlow, which is good,\nas well as for supporting\nthe immune system,\nand for supporting brain health\nthrough the so-called gut brain access.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to Athleticgreens.com/Huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs.\nSo these packs make it really\neasy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhen you're on the road,\nin the car, et cetera.\nAnd they'll give you a year\nsupply of vitamin D3/K2.\nThere's now a lot of\ndata pointing to the fact\nthat vitamin D3 and K2 are\nimportant for hormonal health,\nfor cardiovascular function.\nAnd so if you go to\nAthleticgreens.com/Huberman,\nyou'll get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs,\nand a year supply of vitamin D3/K2.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app\nbacked by 25 peer-reviewed\npublished studies.\nI think by now, most people have heard\nof the benefits of meditation.\nReduce stress, improves sleep,\nbetter cognition, et cetera.\nI've been meditating for a long time,\nbut I have to admit,\nit's been sort of an on and off thing.\nThere are periods of\ntime over the last 10,\nor gosh, even 20 or 30 years,\nthat I've meditated consistently,\nand then I'll stop meditating.\nOne of the terrific things about Headspace\nis that it has meditations\nof different duration\nand different type.\nAnd so I found, that as soon\nas I started using Headspace,\nthat I was meditating\nfar more consistently.\nOne of the great things about meditation\nis that it works the first time,\nand it works every time.\nAnd the more consistently I do it,\nthe more positive\nbenefits I seem to derive.\nIf you'd like to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a free one month trial\nwith all of Headspace's\nfull library of meditations.\nThis is the best deal offered\nby Headspace right now.\nSo if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nI'd like to point you toward\nwhat I think is a very valuable\nzero cost resource online.\nRecently, I took part in an\nevent called Rethink Education\nthat was put on by Logitech.\nAnd there, I gave a 20 minute lecture\nwhere I describe the classic\nand modern neuroplasticity literature\nin both animal models and humans.\nThe neuro-plasticity\nliterature is, of course,\nthe literature that describes\nhow to rewire the brain in order to learn.\nDuring that 20 minute talk,\nI describe that literature,\nbut I also spell out what I call\nthe neuroplasticity super protocol,\nwhich is nine-plus steps of things\nthat teachers can apply in the classroom\nto teach any sort of information,\nmusic, math, sports, anything,\nand that students of any kind in any age\ncan use to enhance the\nspeed and depth of learning.\nYou can find that talk on YouTube\nby following the link in\nthe caption to this episode,\nor by simply going to YouTube\nand entering the search\nterms: Logitech Huberman.\nSome of the most frequent questions I get\nare about food and the brain.\nEverybody seems to want to\nknow what they should eat\nand what they shouldn't eat\nin order to have peak brain function,\nto be able to focus, and\nmemorize things, and so forth,\nand in order to maintain\nbrain health over time,\nbecause nobody wants to lose their memory\nor have troubles with cognition.\nFortunately, there are a lot of data now\nfrom really good quality\npeer-reviewed studies\nthat indicate certain\nthings that we can do,\nincluding certain foods\nthat we should eat,\nand perhaps, even some\nfoods that we should avoid,\nin order to enhance our brain function.\nAnd, of course, when I say, brain,\nwhat I really mean is\nnervous system function,\nbecause how we are able to move,\nand remember things, et cetera,\ndoesn't just depend on the neurons,\nthe nerve cells that are in our head,\nit also depends on our spinal cord,\nand the neurons that connect\nto all the organs of our body.\nSo in general,\nthere are two categories of things\nthat are going to improve brain health\nfrom the perspective of nutrition.\nThe first category is the general category\nof things that we eat and avoid,\nand things that we do and avoid doing,\nthat will modulate brain\nhealth and function.\nWhat do I mean by modulate?\nWell, getting quality\nsleep on a regular basis.\nMaking sure that you're\nsocially connected.\nMaking sure that you're not depressed.\nAll these things are vitally important\nto our overall health ,\nand, of course, they will\nimpact brain function,\nbut they do it, more or\nless, indirectly, okay?\nThere are a few things\nthat happen in sleep\nwhich directly benefit brain function,\nand repair, et cetera.\nBut today, I really want to concentrate,\nnot on the things that\nmodulate our overall health,\nbut rather, the things that\nmediate brain health directly,\nand in particular, how certain\nfoods enhance brain function.\nAnd we are going to talk about\nhow we can change our\nrelationship to food.\nLiterally, how we can start\nto prefer certain foods\nthat are better for us than others.\nSo just briefly, I want to touch\non the modulatory components,\nbecause they are vital.\nFirst of all,\ngetting quality sleep on a regular basis\nand ample sleep on a regular basis\nis the foundation of all mental\nhealth and physical health.\nThere's no question about that.\nWe've have done several episodes,\nincluding the Mastering\nYour Sleep episode,\nwhich is episode two of\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAnd we've done a lot of other episodes\nthat are all about sleep,\nand how to get better at sleeping.\nSo I just want to make crystal clear,\nthat unless you're sleeping\nwell on a regular basis,\nyour brain will suffer.\nYou won't be able to focus\nvery well, learn very well,\nand indeed, there are data linking\npoor quality sleep to dementia,\nor at least exacerbating\npre-existing dementias,\nand things of that sort.\nSo get your sleep in order.\nThe other, of course, is\ncardiovascular health and exercise.\nThe general prescription that's\nout there in the literature,\nand I think is well supported,\nis to get somewhere\nbetween 150 and 180 minutes\nof cardiovascular exercise per week.\nIf you choose to also use\nresistance exercise, that's great.\nBut the 150 to 180\nminutes minimum per week\nof cardiovascular exercise\nis crucial for heart health,\nand heart health directly\nrelates to brain health,\nbecause the brain consumes\na lot of oxygen, glucose,\nand other factors that are\ndelivered via the blood.\nSo if your arteries are clogged up,\nand you've got poor\nvascular supply to the brain\nin any region of the brain,\nyour brain will suffer.\nSo get cardiovascular health in order.\nNow, with those two\nmodulatory elements set forth,\nso that we're all aware that they're there\nand they are vitally important,\nnow, I'd like to turn to the\nelements that have been shown\nto be vitally important\nfor directly controlling,\nfor mediating neuron function.\nNeurons, of course, are\nnerve cells in the brain,\nand there are other cell\ntypes, too, of course,\nthat will impact brain function.\nThe most prominent of which\nare the so-called glia.\nGlia means glue.\nBut even though, for a long time,\npeople thought that these cells\nwere just kind of holding\nthings together passively,\nthe glia play a very active role\nin the metabolism neurons\nin brain function,\nand probably, also, in cognition,\nin thinking, and so forth.\nSo what are the things that\ndirectly impact brain health,\nand what are the foods that we can eat\nthat will support brain health?\nGenerally, when we think\nabout neuron function\nand brain function,\nwe default to a discussion about fuel.\nThe fact that neurons use\nglucose, which is blood sugar,\nand that they require a lot of it.\nIn some cases, they'll use ketones,\nwhich we will talk about\na little bit later,\nespecially in people that are\nfollowing a low carbohydrate\nor ketogenic diet.\nBut before we can even consider the fuels\nthat neurons use in order to function,\nwe have to talk about\nthe elements that actually\nallow those neurons to be there\nand to stay healthy,\nwhat actually makes up those neurons.\nAnd that brings us to, what I would argue,\nis the most important food\nelement for brain function,\nand that is fat.\nAnd that may come as a surprise,\nbut unless one considers the\nwater content of the brain,\nwhich is very high,\na lot of our brain,\nand a lot of the integrity\nof the nerve cells,\nthe so-called neurons in our brain,\nand the other types of\ncells comes from fat.\nAnd that's because nerve cells\nand other cells in the brain\nhave a external layer.\nIt's what's sometimes called\na double-layered membrane.\nIt's essentially two thin layers\nthat serve as a boundary\nbetween those cells,\nand that boundary is important,\nbecause how things pass\nacross that boundary\nactually regulates the\nelectrical activity of neurons,\nwhich is the way that neurons\nfire, and communicate,\nand keep you thinking, and acting,\nand doing all the good things\nthat those neurons allow us to do.\nAnd those membranes are made up of fats,\nbut they're not made up of the fats\nthat are around our belly,\naround the other organs of our body.\nThey're not made up of storage fat.\nThey are made up of structural fat.\nAnd maintaining the so-called integrity\nof that structural fat,\nmeaning the health of those neurons,\nis going to come, in large part,\nfrom the foods that we eat.\nNow, this needs to be underscored.\nWhat I'm saying is, that\nthe foods that we eat\nactually provide the structural\nbasis, the building blocks,\nof the very neurons that\nallow us to think over time.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nthe fat that makes up those\nneurons and other nerve cells\nis different than the other\ntypes of fat in the body.\nSo what type of fat is it,\nand what should we eat\nin order to support that\nfat and those neurons?\nAnd the answer is\nthe so-called essential fatty\nacids and phospholipids.\nNow, those are, more or\nless, the same thing,\nbut I just want to make\na very large literature\nvery crystal clear.\nEssential fatty acids can include\nthe so-called EPA variety or DHA variety.\nYou hear about omega-3s and omega-6s.\nMost people are getting enough\nomega-6s from their diet.\nNot everybody, but most people\nare getting enough omega-6s.\nHowever, most people\nare not getting enough\nomega-3s in their diet to\nsupport healthy brain function\nin the short and long-term.\nI've talked before about the benefits of\nelevating the levels of\nomega-3s in one's diet\nfor sake of offsetting depression\nand for enhancing mood.\nAnd indeed, there's a\nwealth of literature now\npointing to the fact that\ningesting at least one, or two,\nor even three grams per day of\nEPA form of essential fatty acid\ncan have effects, positive effects,\non mood and wellbeing\nthat are at least on par\nwith some of the major\nantidepressant treatments out there,\nbut without similar side effects\nto those antidepressant treatments.\nAnd that for people that are\nalready taking antidepressants,\nthat supplementing with one, to two,\nto three grams of EPA\nessential fatty acids\ncan actually allow a lower dose of\nantidepressant treatment to be used,\nand still be effective.\nSo that's depression.\nBut just in terms of maintaining\nnormal cognitive function\nin people that aren't depressed,\nthe EPAs and omega-3s seem to\nplay a very important role.\nOf course, you can supplement EPAs\nthrough various fish oils,\nand it could be liquid fish\noil, or a capsule fish oil.\nSome people, if they're not\ninterested in eating fish\nfor whatever reason,\nthey're allergic, or for ethical reasons,\nthey can take krill oil.\nAnd if they don't want to use krill oil,\nthey can use algae and other forms of EPA.\nHowever, I think it's clear,\nthat one can get a lot of\nEPA from the proper foods.\nAnd it turns out, that those\nfoods, not surprisingly,\ndon't just contain high levels of EPA,\nbut they also contain other things\nthat are beneficial for brain health.\nSo what are foods that\nare high in omega-3s\nthat we should all probably be consuming,\nat least on a daily basis?\nThe number one is fish.\nSo things like mackerel,\nand salmon, and herring,\nand oysters, and sardines, and anchovies.\nAnd perhaps, the heavyweight champion\nof EPAs per unit volume is caviar.\nNow, I don't know about you,\nbut I'm not eating a lot of fish.\nI'm not eating a lot of caviar.\nI don't think...\nI can't remember the\nlast time I had a caviar,\nunless it was sprinkled\non a little bit of sushi.\nI'm not a big fish eater personally.\nI will from time to time.\nBut that's one reason why\none might want to supplement\nwith EPAs from another source.\nBut also, EPAs are found\nin chia seeds, in walnuts,\nin soybeans, and other plant-based foods.\nYou can look these up online,\nand you'll immediately see\nthat there are a lot of sources of EPAs.\nAnd many of the foods that I listed off\nmight be appetizing to you,\nsome of them might be unappetizing to you,\nor some of them you might\nbe sort of neutral about.\nBut it's very clear,\nthat eating foods that\nare rich in omega-3s,\nand/or supplementing with omega-3s,\nto get above that 1.5 grams,\nand ideally, up to two,\nor even three grams,\nper day of EPA can be very\nbeneficial for cognitive function\nin the short and long-term.\nLater in the episode,\nI'm going talk about\nhow to actually change your relationship\nto particular foods,\nso that foods that you\ndon't particularly like,\nyou can actually start to like more,\nand that might be\nimportant for those of you\nthat are thinking, mackerel, sardines.\nI'm making this face,\n'cause, frankly, those are not\nfoods that I naturally like.\nBut again, I want to emphasize,\nthat you don't have to consume fish\nand animal products in order\nto get sufficient EPAs.\nYou can get them from plants.\nBut I do believe,\nbased on the quality\npeer-reviewed research,\nthat everybody should be striving\nto get a minimum threshold\nof at least a gram and\na half of EPAs per day\none way or the other.\nThe great thing about omega-3s\nis that they are also\nthought to be beneficial\nfor things like cardiovascular health.\nAnd although there's\nsome controversy there\nas to whether or not two\ngrams, or three grams,\nor six grams is ideal for\ncardiovascular health,\nI think the bulk of\nevidence points to the fact\nthat getting sufficient\nomega-3s in the diet\nis going to support cardiovascular health.\nCertainly not the only\nthing people should be doing\nto support their cardiovascular health.\nAerobic exercise, and so\nforth, being important also.\nBut it does seem to support\ncardio vascular health,\nand in doing so, supporting brain health.\nHowever, what I'm emphasizing is,\ningestion of omega-3s to support\nthe very cells within the brain\nthat make up our cognition,\nthat allow for cognition,\nand for movement, and memory,\nand all the other marvelous\nthings that the brain does.\nThe other compound that has been shown\nto be directly supportive\nof neuronal function\nis phosphatidylserine,\nwhich is abundant in meats and in fish.\nSo here we are again\nback to fish being an important source\nof brain supporting food.\nPhosphatidylserine is\nsomething that, nowadays,\npeople are supplementing.\nIt's a lipid-like compound that,\nat least in three studies,\nhave been shown to improve cognition.\nThese weren't huge effects,\nbut they were statistically\nsignificant effects.\nAnd as well in more than three,\nat least five studies,\nto reduce cognitive decline.\nAnd this is interesting.\nIn every case,\nit was 300 milligrams\nsupplemented phosphatidylserine,\nbut one, again,\ndoesn't need to supplement\nphosphatidylserine.\nPhosphatidylserine can be\nderived, as I mentioned,\nfrom meats and fish,\nand to some extent, from\ncabbage of all things.\nSo I don't know how much\ncabbage people are ingesting.\nBut later, when we talk about gut health,\nand the relationship between\ngut health and brain health,\nI'll mention fermented foods.\nAnd, of course, one of the most\nreadily available\nfermented foods out there\nthat at least many people\nfind appetizing is sauerkraut,\nwhich is, of course, made from cabbage.\nIt's fermented cabbage.\nSo for those of you that\ndo consume meat and fish,\nprovided you're getting enough fish,\nyou're probably getting\nenough phosphatidylserine.\nFor those of you that are interested in\nsupplementing phosphatidylserine\nto get these effects\nthat were reported in\nthese various manuscripts,\nwhich, by the way, I've\nread, and looked solid.\nI mean, I don't think we've seen\nthe landmark study showing\nthat supplementing with phosphatidylserine\nat 300 milligrams per day\nis going to create a huge offsetting\nof a massive cognitive decline,\nor a massive increase in brain function.\nThese seem to be modest effects,\nbut the effects do appear to be real.\nFor those of you that are interested\nin supplementing with phosphatidylserine,\nit's a relatively\ninexpensive supplement that,\nagain, is lipid-like.\nSo it's mimicking some of the same things\nthat you would get from food,\nbut in a higher concentration.\nNow, after EPA, fatty acids,\nand phosphatidylserine,\nI would say, third on the list\nof things that come from food\nthat can readily support brain\nfunction would be choline,\nand that's because of the\nrelationship to choline\nin the biosynthesis pathway\nfor a acetylcholine.\nAcetylcholine is a neuromodulator,\nnot a neurotransmitter,\nbut a neuromodulator in the brain.\nA neuromodulator is a\nchemical that modulates\nthe function of many brain circuits,\nand also, circuits within the body.\nI'll mention what those are in a moment.\nBut acetylcholine, as a neuromodulator,\ntends to enhance the activity,\nthe electrical activity\nand chemical activity,\nof certain sets of neurons,\nand downplay the activity\nof other neurons.\nSo it's sort of a conductor of sorts\nleading to enhanced function\nand activity in certain\nbrain areas and circuits,\nand not in others.\nFor instance, the brain\nareas that are involved\nin focus and alertness.\nWe have multiple clusters\nof neurons in our brain\nthat make acetylcholine.\nTwo of the most prominent and well-known\nare the so-called nucleus basalis,\nwhich is a cluster of neurons\ndeep in the basal forebrain\nthat highlight particular\nareas of our brain.\nHighlight meaning when acetylcholine\nis released from those neurons\nat their nerve endings in\nparticular areas of the brain,\nthose particular areas of the brain\ncan undergo enhanced levels of activity\nrelative to surrounding area.\nSo it's kind of a\nelectrical highlighter pen,\nif you will, by analogy.\nThat is the basis of much\nof what we call focus,\nor our ability to concentrate\non a particular batch of information\nthat's coming in through our\neyes, our ears, our nose,\nor even things that we're\njust thinking in our head.\nSo having ample choline for\nproduction of acetylcholine\nallows for focus through, of\ncourse, many intervening steps.\nThere are also regions of the brain\nin the so-called back of\nthe brain, the hindbrain,\nthat release acetylcholine\nthat are involved in\ngeneral states of alertness.\nAnd not surprisingly then,\nmany of the treatments\nfor Alzheimer's disease,\nwhich is an inability\nor challenges with remembering\nthings and focusing,\nare drugs that impact the\nacetylcholine pathway,\nand are aimed at enhancing\nthe amount of acetylcholine\nthat's available to neurons.\nAnd it can do that through a\nnumber of different mechanisms.\nYou can do that by enhancing\nthe amount of acetylcholine\nthat's created,\nor you can do that by taking a drug\nthat can reduce the amount of enzyme\nthat gobbles up the acetylcholine,\nand in doing so, leading\nto more net acetylcholine.\nBut outside of the scenario\nwhere somebody has cognitive\ndecline due to Alzheimer's,\nall of us are able to focus\nto some degree, or not,\nor are able to be alert\nto some degree, or not,\nbased on the amount of\nacetylcholine that we have.\nNow, other processes,\nof course, are involved.\nBut what this means,\nis that making sure that we have enough\nof the substrates to create\nacetylcholine is vital\nif we want to be able to focus,\nand that's why dietary\ncholine is so vital.\nAnd the primary source for\ndietary choline would be eggs,\nand in particular, egg yolks.\nAnd this, again, has a very\ninteresting relationship\nto our evolution as well.\nWe're always referred\nto as hunter gatherers,\nbut when one hears hunters,\nwe often think about\nmeat and animal sources.\nAnd indeed, as a species,\nwe hunted many, many\nother species of animals\nto consume them, and still do.\nBut we also fished.\nWe talked about that earlier.\nAnd consumed a lot of fish,\nand we consumed a lot of eggs.\nEggs are an incredibly rich source\nof nutrients for the brain,\nand that's because the egg, actually,\nif you think about it,\ncontains all the nutrients\nthat are required\nin order for an organism to grow.\nYou know, a bird that's in a egg shell,\nit's got the yolk there,\nand it's using that yolk for a reason.\nIt's using that yolk as a source of fuel.\nIt's using that yolk\nas a source of, literally, building blocks\nin order to create its nervous system.\nMany years ago, I worked on chick embryos,\nand it was these amazing experiments.\nYou could actually take an egg,\nand you could create a\nlittle window in the top,\nand these were fertilized eggs,\nand you'd see, over time,\nyou could peer in there,\nliterally look in with a microscope,\nor even with the naked eye,\nand you would see this little chick embryo\nsitting on top of that\nyolk growing, and growing,\nand growing, and growing,\nand the yolk getting smaller, and smaller.\nIt's really, yeah, incredible.\nThey're using that as a source\nfor all the building blocks of the body,\nbut in particular, the nervous system.\nSo eggs are a rich source of choline.\nSome people will supplement with choline.\nHowever, food sources seem to\nbe the best source of choline.\nAnd as with the EPAs and the omega-3s,\nthere are plenty of foods\nthat are non-animal-based\nthat contain choline.\nSo if you're somebody\nwho doesn't eat eggs,\nor doesn't want to eat eggs,\nthings like potatoes, nuts, and seeds,\nand grains, and fruit,\nthey don't have as much choline as eggs,\nbut they do contain choline.\nSo you can look up the values of choline\nthat are present in those various foods,\nand make sure that you're\nreaching the threshold\namount of choline for you.\nIn general, most people\nshould probably strive\nto get somewhere between 500 milligrams\nand a gram of choline per day.\nSo 1,000 milligrams.\nAnd some people rely on supplementation\nin order to hit those levels,\nbecause they're not\neating a lot of egg yolks,\nor they're not eating\na lot of other foods.\nCertain fish contain\ncholine, for instance,\nand the other foods I\nlisted off a few minutes ago\nfrom plant-based sources.\nSo some people will supplement with\n50 to 100 milligrams,\nor whatever amount is necessary\nto get them up to that one gram,\nor even a two gram, dose per day.\nSo we have three things\nthat we know can support nerve cells.\nEPA, in particular, omega-3 fatty acids,\nphosphatidylserine, and choline,\nthose three things I would list off\nas the top three things\nfor enhancing neuron function,\nand the integrity of neurons\nin the short and long-term.\nAnd this, again, is setting aside\nthe vitally important factors\nof hydration and electrolytes.\nI've said it before on other podcasts,\nbut if you're not ingesting enough water,\nand you're not getting enough sodium,\nand magnesium, and potassium,\nthen, obviously, your neurons can't run,\nbecause a lot of the brain is water.\nYou need to maintain proper hydration.\nAnd sodium, potassium, and\nmagnesium are important\nin order for nerve cells to function.\nIn fact, they are actually\nthe components, the ions,\nthat pass across those lipid membranes,\nthose little fatty membranes\nthat we were talking about earlier,\nthat allow the neurons to\ngenerate electrical activity\nand communicate with one another.\nSo definitely, you want to hydrate enough.\nWe will do an entire other episode\nall about hydration and electrolytes.\nBut omega-3s, the EPAs,\nphosphatidylserine, and choline,\nit's obvious are going to\nimprove brain function.\nHow much they will improve brain function\nprobably depends on\nhow well your brain\nwas working previously.\nIn fact, many of the studies\nthat have looked at the\neffectiveness of these compounds\nhave looked in people that\nare suffering from mild\nor even severe cognitive decline.\nAnd while the outcomes\nof those studies vary,\ngiven the interest in\nmaintaining brain function,\ngiven the fact that we\ndon't make new neurons\nthroughout our entire life,\nand given that everybody has to eat,\nthese are quality healthy foods\nthat we should all be ingesting anyways.\nAnd it's clear that they\ncan support brain function\nto some degree or another.\nMany people will ask what I do\nin light of this information.\nAnd while I can only talk\nabout what works for me,\nI choose to ingest fish\noil mainly in liquid form,\nbecause that turns out\nto be the easiest way\nand the most economically affordable way\nto do it for most people.\nSo there are various forms\nof liquid fish oil out there.\nSome of them include some lemon flavoring,\nso it doesn't taste like fish oil,\nbecause frankly, fish oil, to me,\nis sort of noxious tasting.\nAnd I'll take a tablespoon\nof that, or two, per day.\nIf I'm traveling, I'll\nuse the capsule form\nin order to hit that threshold.\nFor me, about two, sometimes even three,\ngrams per day of EPA.\nSo not just two or three\ngrams per day of fish oil,\nbut two or three grams per day of EPA.\nNow, if I'm eating fish,\nwhich as I mentioned\nearlier, is not often,\nthen I might reduce the amount\nof fish oil that I take.\nBut that's my major source of fish oil.\nCurrently, I do not supplement\nwith phosphatidylserine.\nA number of people that I know and trust,\nand indeed, several colleagues of mine,\ndo take phosphatidylserine.\nI don't have any good explanation\nfor why I don't take it yet,\nbut I have not tried\nsupplementing with it yet.\nMaybe if some of you have,\nyou can place your experience\nin the comment section.\nIt would be of interest.\nAnd then in terms of choline,\nin order to get choline in my diet,\nI do pay attention to\nthe various foods that contain choline,\nand I try and get those foods\non a semi-regular basis.\nI do supplement with\nsomething called alpha-GPC,\nwhich is, essentially, in\nthe acetylcholine pathway,\nor biosynthesis pathway.\nI don't take it very often,\nbut I will take 300 milligrams\nof alpha-GPC from time to time.\nFrom time to time,\nI mean anywhere from two\nto three times per week.\nI'll generally do it early in the day,\n'cause it, for me,\ncan have a little bit\nof a stimulant effect.\nAlthough, it's not nearly\nas stimulating, say,\nas a double espresso, or triple espresso.\nBut that's one way in which I\nenhance my choline function.\nAnd some people choose to\nget it from supplementation,\nbecause it's straightforward.\nThere are a lot of supplements out there\nthat contain alpha-GPC.\nSome people are taking dosages\nas high as 900 milligrams per day.\nThat sounds very high to me.\nThe studies of offsetting\ncognitive decline using alpha-GPC\ndid use quite high dosages of 600 to 900,\nor even 1200, milligrams per day.\nSo it has been used at those\nmuch higher concentrations.\nBut because, fortunately,\nat least, not yet, or not to my awareness,\nI'm not suffering from\nany cognitive decline,\nI will supplement with 300\nmilligrams every now and again.\nNext on my list of compounds\nthat have been shown in\npeer-reviewed research\nto improve neuronal and\nbrain function is creatine.\nCreatine can be derived from meat sources.\nIt can also be supplemented.\nSome of you are probably\nfamiliar with creatine\nor have heard about creatine\nfrom the context of the\nhealth and fitness world,\nwhere creatine is used to\nbring more water into muscles,\nwhich can enhance the\nstrength of those muscles,\nas well as bring water into other tissues.\nIt doesn't just draw\nmore water into muscle,\nit can draw more water\ninto the body generally.\nCreatine has also been shown to have\nan important role in brain function.\nAnd once again, this is\nsomething that came up\nduring the discussion about\ndepression a few episodes back.\nCreatine can actually be used\nas a fuel source in the brain.\nAnd there's some evidence\nthat it can enhance the function\nof certain frontal cortical\ncircuits that feed down onto,\nor rather, connect to, areas of the brain\nthat are involved in mood\nregulation and motivation.\nAnd that's where creatine\nplays a role in depression,\nor rather, where creatine supplementation\nseems to be able to assist in\nsome forms of mild depression.\nThat's an emerging literature.\nIt's still not well-established.\nHowever, there is now ample evidence\nthat creatine supplementation\ncan enhance brain function\nin certain contexts.\nAnd if you're interested in\nlearning more about\nwhat those contexts are,\nthere's an excellent\nreview that just came out.\nThe first author is\nRoschel, R-O-S-C-H-E-L.\nWe will provide a link to this study,\nrather, this review,\nexcuse me, in the caption.\nThis was published just\nvery recently in 2021.\nAnd one thing to make clear,\nis that creatine supplementation\nhas been shown to be especially useful\nfor people that are not consuming any meat\nor other sources of foods\nthat are rich in creatine.\nWhat is the threshold level\nof creatine to supplement\nin order to get the cognitive benefit?\nIt appears to be at\nleast five grams per day.\nNow, the most typical form of creatine\nis so-called creatine monohydrate.\nThere are other forms of creatine as well,\nsome of which are thought to not draw\nas much water into non-muscle tissues,\nand for some people,\nthat's attractive to them.\nThey don't want water sitting\nbelow their skin, et cetera.\nI should emphasize,\nthat the responses to creatine\nin that sense can differ.\nSome people get a little\nbit of water retention.\nSome people experience more.\nThere's some evidence\nthat creatine can impact\nsome of the hormonal pathways,\nthat it might enhance levels of\nso-called dihydrotestosterone, DHT,\nand therefore, because DHT\nis involved in hair loss,\nthere are these theories that\ncreatine can cause hair loss.\nAnd indeed, for people that are\nvery DHT sensitive, it might.\nThere's going to be a lot of\nvariation person to person\nin terms of how much creatine impacts DHT,\nand how many DHT receptors\nthey have on their scalp,\nand therefore, whether or not\nthey experience hair loss.\nI'm just giving you all this information,\nso that you're aware of the various things\nthat creatine can do.\nBut nonetheless, I think it's interesting\nthat creatine supplementation\nof five grams per day,\nthat's creatine monohydrate,\nhas been shown to improve cognition\nin people that aren't getting\ncreatine from animal sources.\nAnd there's some evidence\ndetailed within the review\nthat I just described,\nthat creatine supplementation\ncan also enhance cognition\nin people that are also\neating animal products.\nSo I personally take\ncreatine five grams per day,\nand have for a very long time.\nI can't say that I've\nnoticed a tremendous benefit,\nbecause I've actually\nnever really come off it,\nand so I've never done\nthe control experiment.\nI take it more as kind of a\nbaseline insurance policy.\nFor me, I'm probably losing,\nI'm certainly losing some of my hair.\nWhether or not that's\ndue to creatine or not,\nI've never done the analysis.\nBut what I can say is that,\nI generally consume these things\nlike EPAs, creatine, alpha-GPC\nto set a general context\nof support for my neurons,\nfor my brain.\nAnd, of course, I also pay attention\nto the foods that contain\nthese various compounds.\nSo I don't actively eat additional meat\njust to obtain creatine.\nI eat a fairly limited amount of meat.\nI don't restrict it,\nand I do eat meat,\nbut I don't actively seek\nout creatine in my diet.\nRather, I use supplementation\nin order to hit that five\ngrams per day threshold.\nNext on the list of foods\nthat are beneficial for brain health\nis one that you've probably\nseen pictures of online,\nbecause there seems to be a practice\nof putting pictures of blueberries\nand other dark berries next\nto any title that says,\n\"Foods that benefit your brain\".\nThere are a lot of foods out there\nthat have been purported\nto improve brain function.\nThe interesting thing about\nblueberries and other berries,\nblackberries, dark currants,\nany of these thin-skinned berries\nthat are purpleish in color,\nis that they contain what\nare called anthocyanins.\nAnthocyanins actually\nhave some really nice data\nto support the fact that\nthey improve brain function.\nNow, whether or not it is\ndirect effects on neurons,\nor whether or not it is\nby lowering inflammation,\nor some other modulatory\neffect, isn't quite clear.\nBut I think by now, there's\nenough data to support the fact\nthat eating a cup or two of\nblueberries pretty often,\nevery day, or maybe you have blackberries,\nor maybe it's black currants,\nthat these anthocyanins are good for us,\nthat they are enhancing\nour overall wellbeing\nat a number of different levels.\nAnd just to give you a couple examples\nof where there are actually\npeer-reviewed studies\nto support those statements,\nthe anthocyanins of which blueberries\nand other dark berries are rich in\nhave been shown to reduce\nthe amount of DNA damage,\nhas been shown to reduce significantly,\nalthough, albeit, slightly,\nexcuse me, cognitive decline.\nAnd that particular study was\nsupplementation of a blueberry extract.\nI'll talk about the\ndifference between extract\nand actual blueberries in a moment.\nBut supplementation of blueberry extract\nin offsetting cognitive\ndecline in elderly people.\nSo what constitutes elderly\nis always a little bit of\na debate and a discussion.\nBut in this case, what they did,\nis they supplemented with\nsomewhere between 428,\nI don't know why they selected 428,\nand 598 milligrams of\nanthocyanins daily for 12 weeks\nwas associated with improvements\non verbal learning and memory.\nAnd they had some other beneficial changes\nthat were within the bodily organs,\nand blood glucose\nregulation, and so forth.\nPositive changes.\nBut that's one study.\nIn this case, elderly meant 65 or older.\nThat study, and a number\nof studies like it,\nlooking at things like\nmildly enhanced memory,\nreduced insulin levels,\nreduced oxidation of LDL,\nthese sorts of things,\nhave basically created a situation where\nanytime you Google\nor look up foods that\nenhance brain function,\nyou're going to see a\npicture of a blueberry\nor some other berry,\nbecause of these anthocyanins.\nI personally don't\nsupplement anthocyanins.\nI do like blueberries.\nI eat blueberries when they're in season.\nI love them.\nI'm what you would call a\ndrive-by blueberry eater.\nLike if there are blueberries\nin a bowl on a table,\nand I'm walking by,\nI just have to scoop them up,\nlike some sort of bear, or other animal,\nand pop them in my mouth.\nSo blueberries don't last long around me.\nOne of the issues with berries,\nlike blueberries, and\nblackberries, and so forth,\nis that quality sources of\nthem can be pretty expensive.\nAnd then, of course, when\nthey're not in season,\nthey're hard to get,\nand so that's why some people\nwill supplement with them.\nSo that range of about 400 to\nabout 600 milligrams per day\nseems to be the minimum threshold\nfor getting a cognitive effect\nin these elderly patients.\nIn that case, they were patients.\nA good review about the anthocyanins\npotentially contributing to\noffsetting cognitive decline\nin things like Alzheimer's,\nand also enhancing brain function\nin people that don't have Alzheimer's,\nis a review by Afzal, A-F-Z-A-L,\nthat was published in 2019.\nWe will also provide a link\nto that study in the caption.\nWhen one looks across the\ntotal batch of studies\nthat are out there on this,\nit appears, that if one\nis going to supplement\nwith blueberry extract to get the\nanthocyanin effect on cognition,\ndosages of somewhere between\n5 1/2 or about 11 grams\nseem optimal with the higher end,\ncloser to 10 or 11 grams\nbeing more beneficial.\nThe blueberry eaters out there like me,\nwho prefer to get their anthocyanins\nfrom the actual berries,\nit appears that somewhere\nbetween 60 to 120 grams\nof fresh blueberries each day\nis the way that you can\nget sufficient anthocyanins\nto at least shift your system,\nor bias your brain towards these\nenhanced cognitive effects.\nSo we've got EPA fatty acids,\nwe've got phosphatidylserine,\nwe've got choline,\nwe've got creatine, and\nwe have the anthocyanins.\nAnd the last item that I'd\nlike to place in this list\nof food-derived things\nthat can enhance brain\nfunction is glutamine.\nGlutamine is a very\ninteresting amino acid.\nI've talked about\nglutamine on here before.\nThere's some evidence,\nalthough, somewhat scant,\nthere's some evidence that glutamine\ncan enhance immune system function.\nSo people will supplement with glutamine,\nor people can get glutamine from foods.\nFoods that contain a lot of glutamine\nare things like cottage cheese.\nThere are also other sources of glutamine.\nGlutamine is rich in protein rich foods,\nthings like beef, chicken,\nfish, dairy products, eggs.\nBut also, for you non-animal food\nconsuming people out there,\nvegetables, including\nbeans, cabbage, once again,\nspinach, parsley, things of that sort.\nSo those foods contain glutamine.\nFor people that supplement with glutamine,\ngenerally, they will take\nanywhere from a gram,\nas much as 10 grams, per day.\nWhy would they want to do that?\nWell, there's also some\nevidence starting to emerge\nthat glutamine can help\noffset sugar cravings,\nand I've talked about this\non the podcast before.\nWe're going to talk more about\nthe basis for this a little bit later.\nBut in brief, we all\nhave neurons in our gut\nthat sense the amino acid\ncontent, the fat content,\nand the sugar content of\nthe foods that we eat,\nand signal in a subconscious\nway to our brain\nwhether or not the\nfoods that we are eating\ncontain certain levels\nof certain amino acids.\nAnd so we actually have\nglutamine-sensing neurons in our gut\nthat actually have their little processes,\ntheir little axons and\ndendrites, as we call them,\nin the mucosal lining of the gut.\nThey're not just sensing glutamine,\nbut when they do sense glutamine,\nthey respond, and they\nsend signals to the brain\nthat are signals of\nsatiation, of satisfaction.\nAnd in doing so, can offset\nsome of the sugar cravings\nthat many people suffer from.\nNow, here, we're talking about glutamine\nfor sake of enhancing cognitive function.\nAnd this is interesting,\nbecause it's been shown that\nglutamine supplementation\ncan offset some of the\nnegative effects on cognition\ncaused by altitude and oxygen\ndeprivation of other sorts.\nYeah, okay, well, that's kind of a strange\nand unique situation.\nIf you're going up to altitude,\nshould you supplement with glutamine\nin order to be able to think more clearly?\nWell, it appears that there's\ngood rationale for doing that.\nBut the reason I bring this up,\nassuming that most people, including me,\nare not going up to high\naltitudes very often,\nis that it's been\nwell-established that apnea,\nfailure to breathe properly during sleep,\ncan contribute to age-related,\nand even non-age-related,\ncognitive decline.\nThere are a lot of reasons for apneas,\nranging from obesity to\nobstruction of the airways,\nfor other reasons.\nThere are tremendous number\nof underlying causes of apnea,\nand it's something to be taken seriously.\nI mean, heart attacks, all\nsorts of metabolic issues,\nare caused by apnea.\nApnea is a serious issue that\ndisrupts the depth of sleep,\nand it's a serious\nhealth issue in general.\nIn any event,\napnea is associated with cognitive decline\nand cognitive dysfunction,\neven in young people,\nand it does appear that\nglutamine supplementation\ncan offset some of the cognitive deficits\nthat are associated with reduced\noxygenation of the brain.\nIf you'd like to learn more about\nhow apnea can negatively impact cognition,\nthere's an excellent paper\nthat was published on this in 2018.\nThe first author is Sharma, S-H-A-R-M-A.\nIt should be easy to find.\nThe title of the paper is\n\"Obstructive Sleep Apnea\nSeverity Affects Amyloid Burden\nIn Cognitively Normal Elderly\".\nThis was a longitudinal study.\nAmyloid burden is a\ncorrelate of Alzheimer's\nand other forms of neurodegeneration\nand cognitive decline\nassociated with memory deficits.\nSo obstructive sleep apnea\n[clears throat], excuse me,\nis a very serious issue\nfor which glutamine appears to be able to\noffset some of the\nnegative symptomatology.\nSo how is it that glutamine,\neither from food or\nthrough supplementation,\ncan offset some of these\nso-called hypoxic effects\ncaused by sleep apnea?\nHypoxia being a lack\nof oxygen for the brain\nthat relate to cognitive decline.\nIt appears to have this positive impact\nby way of reducing inflammation.\nSo if you want to look\nmore deeply into the\nvarious biological pathways\nand the supplementation regimes for this,\nthe paper that I think is\nreally spectacular is a paper,\nlast author is Quaresma, Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.\nThat's Q-U-A-R-E-S-M-A.\nIt's a review.\n\"The Possible Importance of\nGlutamine Supplementation to Mood\nand Cognition in Hypoxia\nfrom High Altitude\".\nAnd even though paper is about\nhigh altitude-induced hypoxia,\nit does seem to have direct relevance\nto the sorts of apnea that\nare related to Alzheimer's\nand other forms of cognitive decline.\nNow, I've been taking\nglutamine as a supplement,\ngosh, since I was in college,\nmostly because I felt, either\nby superstition or by reality,\nthat it protected me from\nvarious flus and colds,\nand things of that sort,\nbecause of the purported\nimmune-enhancing effects.\nAgain, those immune-enhancing effects\nhave some data to support them, not a ton.\nHowever, I got into the\nhabit of taking glutamine,\nand now that I've learned that glutamine\nseems to also have some\ncognitive-enhancing effects, possibly,\nit's a supplement that I continue to take.\nI take very small amounts of it,\nbut I do take it on a regular basis.\nSo that, more or less, completes\nthe list of things that,\nat least by my read of the literature,\nare things that are\nsupported by at least three,\nand in some cases, as many\nas hundreds of studies,\nin various populations,\nthat have been explored\nin mouse studies often,\nbut also in a number of human studies.\nI want to emphasize again,\nthat all of the things I listed out,\nwhether or not it's EPAs,\nwhether or not it's phosphatidylserine,\nwhether or not it's choline,\nwhether or not it's the various compounds\nthat are in berries, et cetera,\nall of those can be extracted from food.\nThere is not any law that says\nthat you have to get them\nfrom supplementation.\nSupplementation can help you get\nto the very high levels of those things,\nif you want to work on the higher end,\nif that's right for you.\nObviously, check with your\ndoctor before taking anything\nor removing anything from your\ndiet or supplement regime.\nBut in general, you can get\nthese things from foods.\nIt's just so happens, that\nfor some of these compounds,\nthe foods that they're\ncontained in, like fish,\nare not foods that I particularly enjoy,\nand so I rely on [clears\nthroat], excuse me,\nI rely on supplements in order to get\nsufficient levels for me.\nBut again, you can get\nthese levels from food.\nAnd the reason I made this list,\nthe reason that I emphasize these things\nin this particular order,\nis that they support the\nstructure of neurons.\nThey support the structure of\nthe other cells of the brain\nthat make up our cognition\nand that are important for our focus,\nand our ability to remember\nthings, and so forth.\nAnd they are less so in the category\nof so-called modulatory effects.\nThey will also have\nmodulatory effects on sleep,\non inflammation,\nor reducing inflammation\nthroughout the body,\non cardiovascular function,\nall of which I believe\nare positive affects.\nAt least what the literature tells us,\nis that none of these compounds\nare harming other systems of the body,\nprovided they are taken\nat reasonable levels.\nBut everything in this\nlist is directed towards\nanswering the question, what can I eat,\nwhat can I ingest by way of\nfood, and/or food supplement,\nthat can support brain\nfunction in the short-term\nand in the long-term?\nSo I hope you find that\nlist beneficial for you.\nIf not for use, at\nleast for consideration.\nSo now, having talked\nabout some of the foods\nand micronutrients that are\nbeneficial to our immediate\nand long-term brain health,\nI'd like to shift gears somewhat,\nand talk about why it is\nthat we like the foods that we like.\nWe've all heard before\nthat we are hardwired to pursue sugar,\nand to like fatty foods,\nand that calorie-rich\nfoods are attractive to us\nfor all sorts of reasons,\nyou know, surviving famines,\nand things of that sort.\nAnd while that is true,\nthe actual mechanisms that underlie\nfood seeking and food preference\nare far more interesting than that.\nThere are basically three channels\nin our body and nervous system\nby which we decide what foods to pursue,\nhow much to eat, and\nwhether or not we will find\na particular food attractive,\nwhether or not we will\nwant to consume more of it,\nwhether or not we want to avoid it,\nor whether or not it's just sort of so-so,\nwhat I refer to as the\nyum, yuck, or meh analysis.\nAnd indeed, that's what\nour nervous system is doing\nwith respect to food.\nIt's trying to figure out whether or not,\nyum, I want more of this,\nyuck, I want to avoid this,\nor meh, it's so-so.\nNow, while that may seem like\na overly simplified\nversion of food seeking\nand food preference,\nit's actually not that far from the truth.\nIt actually correctly captures\nmuch of the biology of food preference.\nSo let's talk about what\nthese three channels\nfor food preference are.\nThe first one is an obvious one.\nIt's taste on the mouth.\nIt is the sensation that we\nhave of the foods that we eat\nwhile we're chewing them,\nand those sensations,\nwhich are literally just\nsomatosensory, touch sensations,\nyou know, the palatability of food\nas it relates to the consistency\nof food, that's important.\nAnd as you've all heard before,\nwe have sensors on our tongue\nand elsewhere in our mouth\nthat detect the various\nchemicals contained within food,\nand lead to the senses of taste,\nwhich we call bitter, sweet,\numami, salty, and sour.\nNow, most of us are familiar\nwith the sense of bitterness\nthat comes from something\nlike a raw radish,\nsweet, which comes, obviously,\nfrom sugars of different kinds,\nfructose, glucose, et cetera,\nsalty, salty,\nand sour, think lemon or\nlemon juice, for instance.\nAnd then I mentioned umami.\nThe umami receptor is a\nreceptor that responds\nto the savory taste of things.\nSo that's what you might find in a really\nwonderfully rich tomato sauce.\nFor those of you that\neat meat, and like meat,\na really well cooked ,not\nnecessarily well done,\nbut properly cooked, I should say, steak,\nif that's your thing.\nAnd umami is present in\nboth plant and animal foods,\nand gives us that sensation of savoriness.\nIt almost has a kind of little\nbit of a briny taste to it,\nor braised taste to it.\nAnd indeed, brazing of meats\nand brazing of vegetables\nis done specifically to\nactivate that umami receptor.\nSo we have those five basic tastes.\nThose are chemical sensors\non the tongue that,\nwhat we call, transduce those chemicals.\nThose chemicals, literally, in\nfood bind to those receptors,\nand it is transduced,\nmeaning the binding of those\nchemicals to the receptors\nis converted into an electrical signal\nthat travels in from the tongue\nalong what's called the gustatory nerve.\nThe gustatory nerve then synapses,\nmeaning it makes\nconnections in our brainstem\nin the so-called nucleus\nof the solitary tract.\nThere are other nuclei back there.\nNuclei just aggregates of neurons.\nAnd then it sends information up to\nthe so-called insular\ncortex, to the insula.\nI want to highlight the\ninsula this episode,\nbecause we are going\nto return to the insula\nagain and again in this\nepisode, and later.\nThe insular cortex is\na incredible structure\nthat we all have\nthat mainly is concerned\nwith so-called interoception,\nor our perception of what's\ngoing on inside our body.\nSo it could be the amount\nof pressure in our gut\nbecause of how much food we've eaten.\nIt could be the acidity of our gut,\nif we're having a little bit\nof indigestion, for instance.\nIt can also be the case,\nthat neurons within the\ninsula are paying attention\nto how stressed you are,\nor how alert you are,\nor how tired you are.\nSo it's really an inward\nfocusing structure.\nIt focuses on how we feel internally.\nAnd not surprisingly,\nthe taste system sends information\nup to the insular cortex\nto give us a sense, literally,\nof what we've ingested,\nwhether or not what we're\ntasting tastes good or not.\nWe will return to insular\ncortex in a few moments.\nA very important thing to understand,\nis that the neurons in\nthe areas of the cortex,\nyour cortex and mine, that\nrespond to particular tastes\nare providing an internal representation\nof an external sense.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nI don't want to be at all abstract.\nWe take these foods,\nwe break them down in our\nmouth by chewing them,\nor sucking on them,\nwhatever it is the food happens to be,\nthose chemicals bind to those receptors,\nand electrical signals\nare sent into the brain,\nbut they are just electrical signals,\njust like notes being played\non the keys of a piano.\nThere's no unique signature\nfor salty or sweet.\nIt is the relative activation\nof one set of neurons\nthat was activated by sweet,\nor another set of neurons\nthat was activated by umami.\nIt's that relative activation\ntraveling into the brain in,\nessentially, the same form,\nthe same electrical signals.\nThis is really incredible, right?\nElectrical signals are\nsent into the brain,\nand you say, aha, that's\nsweet and I want more of it,\nor that's bitter, or I want less of it,\nor that's umami flavored,\nand I really, really like that,\nreally like savory foods, as I happen to.\nThat should immediately\nstrike you as incredible,\nbecause it means that your representation\nof what you want more of or\nless of is electrical in nature.\nAnd to really tamp this issue down,\nstudies that were done by\nCharles Zuker, Z-U-K-E-R...\nHe's a absolutely\nphenomenal neuroscientist\nat Columbia University in New York.\nStudies done by the Zuker\nLab have shown that,\nfirst of all, they could identify\nthe neurons in the cortex\ndeep in the brain that\nrespond to a sweet taste\nor to a bitter taste.\nIt turns out, they are non-overlapping\npopulations of neurons.\nAnd then using some molecular tricks,\nthey were able to either silence\nor activate the neurons\nthat, for instance,\nrespond to sweet.\nWhen they do this,\nthey see incredible\nconsequences on perception\nthat, indeed, occur in your brain,\nand my brain as well, all the time\nwithout these kind of manipulations.\nHere's the experiment.\nThey have a subject drink\nwater that contains sugar,\nor drink water that\ncontains a salty substance,\nor drink water that contains\na bitter substance, for instance.\nOkay, I'm sort of paraphrasing\na large amount of work.\nThey identify the neurons\nthat respond to sweet tastes.\nThey see, as many researchers have seen,\nthat subjects prefer sweet\ntaste to other tastes,\nand certainly, sweet tastes to bitter,\nor sweet tastes to\nnothing, so to plain water.\nAnd then they go in,\nand they are able to\nselectively silence the neurons\nthat represent sweet.\nAnd when they do that,\nthey eliminate the preference\nfor that sweet taste.\nNow, that might seem obvious,\nthe neurons respond to sweet,\nand you silence those neurons,\nthey no longer seek out sweet.\nBut that should strike\nyou, also, as incredible,\nbecause they're not actually changing\nwhat's happening on the tongue\nor in the deeper layers of the brain.\nConversely, they can have\nsubjects drink bitter water\nor plain water while activating,\nselectively activating, the\nneurons that respond to sweet.\nAnd what they find,\nis that then subjects will\nactively prefer bitter\nor plain water to actual\npreferences, such as sweet.\nSo what this means is that,\nyour perception of what\nyou like is a central,\nmeaning deep within the brain, phenomenon.\nIt's not about how things\ntaste on your mouth.\nNow, of course, under normal conditions,\nwhere there aren't these\nexperimental manipulations being done,\nthose things are positively correlated.\nSweet tastes trigger the activation\nof sweet neurons, for instance.\nNeurons in the mouth\nthat respond to umami,\ntrigger the activation\nof neurons in the brain\nthat respond to umami, and so forth.\nSo they're correlated in a way\nthat makes you seek out\nthe things that you like,\nand avoid the things that you don't like.\nBut as we'll see in a few minutes,\nturns out, that that is\nnot a direct relationship\nthat is hardwired.\nYou can actually uncouple\nthe preference for a particular taste\nwith the reward systems in the brain\nin a way that, for instance,\nwould allow you to eat,\nor I should use myself as an example,\n'cause I don't particularly like fish.\nI've had a few meals that include a fish\nthat were pretty good,\nbut none of them were memorable\nin the kind of positive way,\nthat like some other events\nin my life were memorable.\nBut by way of these circuitries,\nand the way they link up with one another,\nit's actually possible to\nrewire one's sense of taste\nand preference for particular foods.\nIf this is seeming at all vague to you,\njust hang in with me a little bit longer,\nbecause I will provide you\nwith the information, tools,\nand resources with which\nto navigate this process.\nBut the most important\nthing to understand is that,\nlike with our hearing,\nlike with vision,\nlike with smell,\ntaste is an internal representation\nthat has particular goals for you.\nYour sense of what tastes good\nis related to particular things\nthat are occurring in your brain and body,\nand that are likely to give your brain\nand body the things that it needs.\nIt is not simply a matter of\nwhat you, quote/unquote, \"like\",\nor what tastes good, or\nwhat doesn't taste good.\nLet me give you a\nrelatively simple example\nof how your body and your brain are acting\nin a coordinated way\nto make you prefer certain foods,\nand indeed, to pursue certain foods more.\nAs I just mentioned, you\nhave neurons on your tongue\nthat respond to different tastes.\nBut, of course, your digestive\ntract isn't just your tongue,\nit's also your throat.\nIt goes all the way down to your stomach,\nand, of course, your intestines.\nIt's a long tube of digestion.\nAll along that tube there are neurons.\nSome of the neurons are responding to\nthe mechanical size of\nwhatever portion of the\ndigestive tract it happens to be.\nSo for instance, how distended,\nor empty, or full, rather,\nit doesn't have to be distended,\nit depends on how much you ate,\nbut how full or empty\nyour gut happens to be,\nwhether or not something you\njust ate is temperature hot,\nyou know, is hot in the\nsense of hot to the touch,\nor whether or not it's spicy hot,\nwhether or not it's soothing,\nwhether or not it's\nkind of hard to swallow,\nthis kind of thing.\nSo you have neurons all along your gut\nthat are responding to the mechanics\nrelated to food and digestion,\nand that are related to the\nchemistry of food and digestion.\nThere's a population of neurons,\nnerve cells in your gut,\nthat are exquisitely\ntuned to the chemistry\nof whatever it is in your gut.\nAnd these are neurons\ncalled neuropod cells.\nThey were discovered many, many years ago,\nbut really defined with\nand classified with modern tools\nby Diego Bohorquez.\nI hope I'm pronouncing\nyour name correctly.\nDiego, we've spoken many times,\nbut I can't ever seem to quite capture\nthe proper pronunciation just right.\nBut Diego Bohorquez at Duke University,\nwho discovered that these cells\nreside within the gut,\nand place little processes,\nthey're little axons and dendrites,\nwithin the mucosal lining of the gut.\nAnd there, they are paying attention to,\nmeaning they respond to,\namino acids, sugars, and fatty acids.\nSo as your food is digested,\nas food lands within your gut,\nneurons there are sensing what\ntypes of foods are available,\nand what types of things\nare making their way\nthrough the gut environment.\nNow, those neurons aren't\nactually taking those foods\nand doing much with them.\nWhat they're doing, is they're essentially\nsurveying what qualities\nof food are there.\nAnd these particular neurons\nthat Diego and his group discovered,\nsend electrical signals up into the brain\nthrough a little passage that\nwe call the nodose ganglion.\nThe nodose ganglion is\na cluster of neurons\nthat then send up their\nown process into the brain,\nand trigger the release of dopamine,\nwhich is a molecule that\ninspires motivation, reward,\nand more seeking for whatever\nit is led to their activation.\nThese are super interesting neurons,\nbecause what they're essentially doing,\nis they are providing\na subconscious signal\nabout the quality of the\nfood that you're eating,\nwhat it contains,\nand then triggering the release\nof a molecule within your brain, dopamine,\nthat leads you to go\nseek more of those foods.\nNow, this has profound\nimpact on a number of things.\nFirst of all,\nthere's the consideration\nof so-called hidden sugars.\nDr. Robert Lustig, who's a\npediatric endocrinologist\nat University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco,\nhas been among the most\nprominent researchers\nto talk about the fact\nthat there are these so-called\nhidden sugars in foods.\nNow, these are not just sugars,\nthat they sneak in just to be sneaky,\nthese are sugars that\nare literally snuck in\nin a way that you can't taste them.\nThat's why they're called hidden sugars.\nIt's not that they just\nput them in there for fun.\nThese are sugars that are\nplaced into processed foods\nthat are designed to trigger activation\nof these mechanisms\nto lead you to want to\neat more of these foods,\nbut not because they necessarily\ntaste sweet or delicious,\nbut because they are activating\nthese subconscious mechanisms\nthat are driving you to\npursue more of these foods.\nIt sounds like a very diabolical strategy,\nand indeed, it is somewhat\nof a diabolical strategy.\nHowever, these neurons are also involved\nin signaling to your\nbrain when, for instance,\nyou are eating a food that is\nrich in omega-3 fatty acids,\nthe fatty acids that we\nwere talking about earlier.\nSo why is it that you don't crave salmon?\nWhy is it that I don't sit around\ndaydreaming about mackerel?\nWell, because there's also the influence\nof the actual taste on the mouth.\nUnder normal conditions,\nit's a combination of the taste\nof the thing on the mouth,\nplus the subconscious\nsignaling from the gut.\nAnd while this isn't a\ndiscussion about gut microbiome,\nI should just mention,\nthat it's very clear\nthat having a healthy gut microbiome\nallows these neurons to function in a way\nthat serves our seeking of\nhealthy foods in positive ways.\nAnd without getting into a\nlot of detail about this,\nthe best way to ensure\na healthy gut microbiome\nthat I am aware of\nis not necessarily\nto take supplemental\nprebiotics or probiotics.\nThere are actually some reasons why\nyou might not want to do that.\nBut rather, to ingest two to four servings\nof fermented foods that\nare low in sugar each day.\nThere is a recent study published in Cell\nshowing that the ingestion\nof fermented foods,\ntwo to four servings each day,\ncan enhance the quality of\nthe mucosal lining of the gut\nthat allows certain gut\nmicrobiota to flourish,\nand the gut microbiota\nthat are not good for us\nto not flourish,\n'cause that's the environment\nthat they settle down into.\nThis is work that was carried out\nby my colleagues, Justin Sonnenburg,\nwhich is in the laboratory\nupstairs from me,\nas well as Chris Gardner,\nand others at Stanford.\nThey are certainly not the only\nresearchers exploring this.\nBut it does appear,\nthat two to four servings of\nfermented foods each day,\nso these would be things\nlike natto, sauerkraut,\nlow sugar fermented foods, is\ngreat for the gut microbiome.\nAnd separate studies, not their study,\nbut separate studies have shown\nthat the correct gut microbiome conditions\nallow these neurons\nthat signal to the brain\nto signal the right, at the right times,\nand in the right ways to\npromote healthy food seeking.\nMany people opt to supplement\nwith capsule form probiotics.\nThere are some data that suggests\nthat maybe those don't\ncontain the correct prebiotics\nand probiotics for setting the correct\ngut microbiota conditions.\nThat's a little bit of\na controversial issue.\nNonetheless, getting\nprobiotics from fermented foods\nis probably the simplest and\nmost straightforward way.\nIt's also the way that we\nevolved to do that over many,\nat least hundreds, and\nprobably, thousands,\nor even tens or hundreds\nof thousands of years,\npeople have been\ningesting fermented foods,\nnot just for their tastes,\nbut for their health benefits as well.\nSo now I've mentioned two\nof the three mechanisms\nby which we prefer certain foods.\nOne is from the actual taste\nthat we're familiar with,\nthe taste on our tongue, and in our mouth,\nin the sensations that make\nus go mmm, or ugh, or eh,\nthe yum, yuk, meh responses,\nas I referred to them earlier.\nAnd then there's this\nsubconscious signaling\ncoming from the gut\nthat's really based on the\nnutrient content of the foods.\nThere's a third pathway,\nwhich is the learned association\nof a particular taste\nwith the particular quality\nor value that a food has.\nAnd this is where things\nget really interesting,\nand where there's\nactually a leverage point\nfor you to rewire\nwhat it is that you find tasty,\nand that you want to seek more of.\nThe work I'd like to talk about next\nhas been carried out in mouse models,\nand has been carried out in\nparallel experiments in humans.\nThis is largely, not exclusively,\nbut largely the work of Ivan\nde Araujo and Dana Small.\nIvan de Araujo is at Mount\nSinai School of Medicine.\nAnd Dana Small is at Yale.\nAnd they, and others in their field,\nhave done incredible experiments\nexploring how taste and food value,\nthe nutritional value of food,\nand the impact of that food\non metabolism in the brain\ndrives our food choices,\nand allows us to change our\nfood choices for the better.\nTheir groups have done\nsome really amazing studies\ninvolving ingestion of\na particular substance\nthat either contains sugar,\nand thereby, can elevate\nglucose, blood sugar, or not.\nAnd varying, meaning\nchanging the taste associated\nwith that ingestion of sugar.\nSo let me just give you a simple example\nwhere they have subjects,\nthese could be mice or\nthese could be humans,\n'cause they've done both sets of studies,\ndrink sweet water as an alternative\nor a choice to non-sweetened\nwater, or bitter water,\nor some other flavor.\nAnd what they find, is that\nmice and humans will prefer\nto consume the sweet beverage.\nNow, it's not always sweet water.\nMice like sweet water,\nbut humans will prefer,\nfor instance, a milkshake,\na fatty sweet drink.\nThey'll consume more of that,\nand not surprisingly,\ndopamine levels in the brain\nincrease in response to that.\nSo the taste and the nutrient content\nof what it is that they're\ningesting are aligned.\nThey are matched.\nThey've also done experiments\nwhere they have no taste,\nbut subjects are being infused with sugar\ndirectly into the gut.\nAnd not surprisingly,\nbased on everything I've\ntold you up until now,\nsubjects will pursue more of that thing\nrelative to some other taste,\neither neutral or negative taste,\nbecause that sugar in the gut\nis triggering the activation\nof the neurons I mentioned earlier,\nwhich is signaling to the brain\nto pursue more of that thing.\nSo this tells us something important.\nIt tells us that we are driven,\nmeaning we have mechanisms in our brain\nthat make us motivated to pursue\nmore of what brings both\na taste of sweetness,\nbut also that brings actual changes\nin blood glucose levels up, okay?\nSo we are motivated to eat sweet things\nnot just because they taste good,\nbut because they change\nour blood sugar level.\nThey increase our blood sugar level.\nThis is important,\nbecause it needn't be the case.\nIt could have been that we were just wired\nto pursue things that taste good.\nBut what this tells us,\nis that we are actually\nwired to pursue things\nthat increase our blood glucose,\nso much so that when the small lab...\nIt's not a small lab.\nIt's actually a big lab.\nBut when Dana Small's lab,\nand/or Ivan de Araujo's lab,\nhave done experiments\nwhere they use a compound\ncalled 2-deoxyglucose,\nthis is a compound that\ncan prevent glucose from\nbeing metabolized by neurons.\nSo blood glucose is going up,\nbut neurons can't use it.\nWhat they find, is that the reinforcing\nor the rewarding properties of a food\nor taste are eliminated.\nPut simply, it is not\nsufficient for a food\nto taste good consciously.\nIt is not sufficient for a\nfood to increase blood sugar.\nYou need blood sugar to go up,\nand that blood sugar glucose\nhas to be utilized by the neurons,\neven if it's not associated\nwith a good taste.\nAnd to make it even simpler,\nif this isn't sinking in,\nthis should make it very clear.\nWhat your brain,\nmeaning, what you are seeking\nwhen you eat, is not taste,\nis not dopamine,\nis not even a rise in blood glucose.\nWhat you're seeking, even\nthough you don't realize it,\nbecause it's subconscious,\nis you are seeking things\nthat allow your neurons\nto be metabolically active.\nAnd this is fundamentally important\nfor understanding why you eat,\nwhy you eat particular foods,\nand how you can change your\nrelationship to those foods.\nNow, earlier, I referred to circuits\nthat are wired for a particular outcome.\nAnd in biology, and in\nparticular, neuroscience,\nwe refer to things that\nare either hard-wired,\nmeaning immutable, and\nunchangeable, or soft-wired.\nA good example of soft-wiring would be\nthe areas of your brain that\nare responsible for speech\nand language are always, more or less,\nin the same place in your brain\nand everyone else's brain.\nHowever, they are not\nhard-wired to speak French,\nor to speak English, or to speak Chinese,\nor to speak German,\nbecause depending on where you were born,\nand the parents that you're born to,\nyou need to be able to speak one\nor maybe even more languages.\nThe taste system,\nand this general system of\nseeking particular foods,\nsimilarly is hard-wired to obtain\ncertain types of nutrients.\nIt tends to like sweet things.\nMost children naturally like sweet things,\nsome more than others.\nBut naturally, most people\nfrom childhood onward\ndon't particularly crave\nvery bitter substances.\nMaybe mildly bitter, but not very bitter.\nSo there's some hard-wiring of preference,\nbut there's also some\nsoft-wiring in the system\nthat allows it to change.\nThe groups I mentioned earlier\nhave done some really\nbeautiful experiments\nlooking at how artificial sweeteners\ninteract with the actual\nsweet sensing system.\nAnd this gets right down\nto a number of issues.\nFirst of all, it gets to the issue of\nhow we can rewire our taste system\nin ways that serve us\nfor better or for worse.\nSecond of all, it gets\nright down to the issue\nof whether or not artificial sweeteners\nare good for us or bad for us.\nAnd indeed, as of just this last year,\nwe know an answer to that question,\nand turns out, it depends.\nAnd I will tell you in a few minutes\nwhen it is okay to ingest\nartificial sweeteners,\nand when it is very detrimental\nto ingest artificial\nsweeteners of any kind.\nRegardless, I'm not going\nto name off brand names,\nbut there are different forms of these\nartificial sweeteners nowadays.\nAnd there are various forms\nof non-caloric plant-based sweeteners\nfor which the same information\nthat I'm about to tell you applies.\nOkay.\nSo the experiments that were done\nbeautifully illustrate that\nyou seek out particular foods\nbecause of the way they taste,\nbecause of their impact\non blood glucose levels,\nbut also on their impact\non the dopamine system,\neven if your blood glucose\nlevels don't change.\nSo here's the experiment.\nOne group of subjects\nis given a sweet taste\nof a substance that also raises\nblood glucose levels, blood sugar,\nand dopamine goes up, not surprisingly.\nThe second condition,\nseparate subjects consume\nan artificial sweetener\nor a non-caloric sweetener.\nIt is not preferred much\nover other substances,\nbut it is sweet, so\nit's preferred somewhat.\nAnd it does not cause an\nincrease in blood glucose levels,\nand not surprisingly,\ndopamine levels don't go up.\nSo initially, we don't tend to like\nartificial sweeteners that much.\nThat's the simple way of putting it.\nHowever, if subjects continue\nto ingest artificial sweeteners,\neven though there's no increase\nin blood glucose level,\nand therefore, no increase\nin brain metabolism,\ndopamine levels eventually start to rise.\nAnd when those dopamine levels\neventually start to rise,\nyou've essentially conditioned\nor reinforced that artificial\nor non-caloric sweetener,\nand then subjects start\nto consume more of it,\nand they actually get a\ndopamine increase from it.\nSo that's interesting.\nIt says that, consuming more\nof these artificial sweeteners,\nor consuming them for a\nlonger period of time,\ncan start to tap into the dopamine system,\nand lead us to seek out\nor consume more of these\nartificial sweeteners.\nMany people are probably\nfamiliar with this,\nbecause we tend to,\nor I should say, people report,\nthat when they ingest these\nartificial sweeteners,\nat first, they don't taste very good,\nbut then, over time, they\nseem kind of tolerable,\nand then maybe even pleasureful,\nand then some people feel, quote/unquote,\n\"addicted\" to various diet\nsodas, and things of that sort.\nNow, there's another condition\nthat's been explored,\nand that's the really\ninteresting condition,\nand it's the condition where\nan artificial sweetener\nis paired with a substance\nthat can increase blood sugar,\nbut not because it tastes sugary,\nlike a normal sweet substance.\nSo now, there's an artificial sweetener\nthat's coupled with an actual\nincrease in blood glucose.\nThe natural world scenario\nwhere this would happen\nwould be drinking a diet soda\nwhich contains no calories,\nand therefore, would not\nincrease blood glucose,\nbut is sweet, with a food\nthat increases blood glucose.\nAnd when that happens,\nwhat you're essentially doing,\nis tapping into the dopamine system.\nThis non-caloric sweet\ntaste is paired with it,\nand there's an increase\nin neuron metabolism.\nSo you have all of the\ncomponents for reinforcement.\nAnd as a consequence,\nyou get in a sort of\nPavlovian conditioning way,\na situation where, later,\nwhen you ingest that artificial sweetener,\nyou actually get not only\nthe increase in dopamine,\nbut you get alterations\nin blood sugar management.\nNow, blood sugar cannot go up\nif you don't ingest something\nthat makes blood sugar go up.\nSo it's not as if you\ningest artificial sweetener\nwith some food that\ncontains calories or sugar,\nand then later, you remove the food,\nand you just drink the soda,\nand your blood glucose goes up.\nRather, it's a much worse situation.\nI'll make this in the\nnatural world context.\nIf you ingest an artificial sweetener,\nsay, drink diet soda while consuming foods\nthat increase blood glucose,\nthen later, even if you\njust drink the diet soda,\nit's been shown that you\nsecrete much more insulin,\nthe hormone that regulates blood glucose,\nin response to that diet soda.\nStudies have been done\nin both adult humans\nand in human children.\nIn general, when we say children,\nwe mean human children,\nbut just to be very clear\nwhat we're talking about.\nExploring consuming diet\nsoda with or without food,\nthen later, consuming just the diet soda.\nAnd what they found was,\nhaving previously consumed\ndiet soda with food,\nand then later, only\nconsuming the diet soda,\nof course, there isn't an\nincrease in blood glucose,\nbecause they're not\nbringing in any calories\nwhen they just drink the diet soda,\nbut there is a significant\nincrease in insulin release,\nand that is serious in a terrible way,\nbecause increased release of insulin,\nand so-called insulin sensitivity,\nis the basis for type 2 diabetes.\nSo much so, that in the\nstudy with the children,\nconsuming non-caloric\nbeverages in this way,\nfirst with food, and then on their own,\nled to increases in insulin\nthat made them pre-diabetic,\nand they actually had to halt the study.\nSo I want to zoom out from this,\nand just really illustrate\nthe major findings,\nand then talk about\nhow this can be applied\nin the positive sense.\nI also want to mention what this means\nin terms of your consumption\nof artificial sweeteners of any kind.\nSo first of all,\nthe direct takeaway about\nartificial sweeteners.\nArtificial sweeteners are not bad for you.\nI'm not going to say that.\nWhat I am going to say,\nis that whether or not\nyou ingest them alone,\nor you ingest them in\ncombination with food,\nor as part of foods that\nraise blood glucose,\nis vitally important for\nyour insulin management.\nAnd the simple extractor\ntool from this is,\nif you are going to consume\nartificial sweeteners,\nit's very likely best to consume those\naway from any food that\nraises blood glucose levels.\nSo if you're going to enjoy\ndiet soda, be my guest,\nbut do it not while consuming food,\nin particular, foods\nthat raise blood glucose.\nBecause what these studies show,\nand I will provide references for these,\nis that they can vastly disrupt\nblood sugar management by way of\nthe insulin glucose system, okay?\nAnd actually, I'll just\ngive you the reference now.\nThis is a paper from Dana Small's lab.\nThe first author is\nDalenburg, D-A-L-E-N-B-U-R-G.\nAnd the title of the paper is\n\"Short-term Consumption of Sucralose With,\nnut Not Without Carbohydrate,\nImpairs Neural and Metabolic Sensitivity\nto Sugar in Humans\".\nThis is a paper published\nin \"Cell Metabolism\"\nin March of 2020.\nI think it's a very important paper.\nAnd similar findings have\nbeen addressed in mice,\nand in other studies.\nAnd now, because of this paper,\nthere's now a bunch of other\ngroups working on this issue.\nThere's some evidence previously\npublished in \"Nature\",\nan excellent top-tier journal.\nSort of among the Superbowl\nof top three journals,\nbeing \"Nature\", \"Science\", and \"Cell\".\nA paper published in\n\"Nature\" a few years back\nshowing that particular\nartificial sweeteners\ncan disrupt the gut microbiome,\nand have deleterious health effects.\nThat result, I think, stands,\nalthough, there are some results\nthat may not agree with that,\ndepending on whether or not\nthe artificial sweetener\nis saccharin, or sucralose,\nor aspartame, or stevia.\nThat's the gut microbiome.\nBut what we are talking about here\nis independent of the form of artificial\nor non-caloric sweetener,\nbecause it has everything to do with\nwhether or not there is a match\nor a mismatch between the perceived taste,\nand the effect of the thing\nthat you are consuming\non blood sugar and metabolism.\nSo the first takeaway from this is,\nif you're going to consume\nartificial sweeteners,\nit's really important that you do that\nnot in conjunction with foods\nthat increase blood glucose.\nSecond of all, it points to the fact,\nthat the foods that we prefer,\nand the activation of the dopamine system,\nboth through the gut,\nand at the level of conscious taste,\nin other words, what we\nlike, is very plastic.\nIt's mutable, and we can change it.\nHow can we change it?\nWell, earlier, I mentioned\na structure in the brain\ncalled the insula,\nthis incredible structure that's\ninvolved in interoception,\nand interoception of all kinds.\nIn fact, just as an aside,\na year or so ago,\nmy lab published a paper showing that\nactivity within certain\ncompartments of the insula\nof humans is responding to\na heightened state of anxiety in the body.\nIt can respond to changes\nin our respiration,\nchanges in our heart rate.\nSo this is...\nAgain, it's a readout\nof our internal state,\nnot just of taste,\nbut of many, many different\naspects of the mechanics\nand chemistry of our internal\nmilieu within our body.\nAll of the work that I\nwas describing previously\nhas also been addressed\nat the neural level.\nAnd using a broad brush\nto explain these results,\nwhat we can say is,\nwhen there is dopamine increase,\none sees activation of the\nso-called nucleus accumbens,\nwhich is part of the so-called\nmesolimbic reward pathway.\nIf you'd like to learn more about\nthe mesolimbic reward pathway,\nand dopamine in general\nin humans and in animal studies,\nand all the various incredible\nand challenging things that\ndopamine can do for us,\nthere's a episode all about\ndopamine that you can look up.\nIt's easy to find at Hubermanlab.com.\nThe increases in dopamine\nassociated with sweet taste\nand/or blood glucose\nelevating foods and drinks,\ncause activation of the nucleus accumbens.\nThat's not surprising.\nAlso in the circuit\nis activation of the\nso-called arcuate nuclei\nwithin the hypothalamus.\nThese are areas of the hypothalamus\nthat respond to hormones from the body,\nand respond to hormones and\nneuropeptides in the brain,\nas well as neural signals in the brain,\nto drive us to eat\nmore, or to stop eating.\nSo it's hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens.\nThese are sort of the...\nHypothalamus and the arcuate\nbeing the motivating to eat,\nor motivating to stop eating.\nBoth sets of neurons are contained there.\nThere are other areas like the\nlateral hypothalamus as well.\nBut hypothalamus is\nsort of the accelerator\nand the break on eating.\nAnd then the nucleus accumbens\nand dopamine release can be thought of\nas kind of a nitro boost, if\nyou will, like the kids say.\nDo the kids say that anymore?\nAnyway, a nitro boost to\nincrease what we call the gain\nor the volume of how much you\nwant more of something, okay?\nWhen dopamine is present,\nit's this kind of generic signal\nto go seek out more of\nwhatever caused that release.\nAnd then there's the insula.\nThis very thoughtful, rational...\nNot really.\nIt's not thinking.\nIt's a brain area.\nYou're thinking, but it's part\nof the areas of your brain\nthat are interpreting what's\ngoing on in your body.\nWhether or not you feel good or not good.\nWhether or not you feel\nanxious, excited, or fearful.\nIt's integrating all that information.\nAnd fed into this entire circuit as well\nare the inputs from\nyour prefrontal cortex,\nwhich is your thinking, rational,\nneuronal structure, if you will,\ninforming you, for instance,\nah, well, I don't really\nlike salmon very much,\nor I'm not so crazy about kale,\nbut it has omega-3s,\nor it's rich in these\npolyphenols that are good for me.\nAnd if one decides that they\nare going to eat these things,\nnot just because they are good for them,\nbut believe it or not,\nif one takes the perception\nor adopts the perception that\nthey are both good for you,\nand that in being good for you,\nthey are good for your brain metabolism,\nand that you desire to be healthy,\nas crazy as it sounds,\nthose subjective signals\nof what you tell yourself\nabout the foods that you're eating\ncan actually impact how\nthose foods will taste,\nmaybe not immediately, but eventually,\nand can impact the way in which your body\nutilizes those foods.\nNow, that might seem like\na absolute pipe dream.\nIf I just imagine that I like mackerel,\nmackerel will start to taste good.\nI'm not saying that.\nI didn't say that you\ncould override yuck signals\nwith this mechanism.\nI didn't say that you could take a food\nthat would be absolutely noxious to you,\nor make you want to\nvomit, and override that.\nHowever, foods that are\nsomewhat neutral to you\ncan take on a different value\nbased on the activation\nof the dopamine system.\nAnd now, knowing what you know,\nthere are a couple ways that\nyou could imagine doing that.\nFirst of all, you could,\nin this so-called gedanken,\nor thought experiment,\nyou could, for instance,\nswap out sucralose,\nbecause sucralose is just a taste, right?\nIt's an artificial sweet taste.\nYou could swap that out,\nand insert kale,\nbut eat the kale with something\nthat raises blood glucose\nto some degree or another.\nNow, I'm not encouraging\nanyone to run out there\nand spike their blood\nglucose glucose like crazy.\nAnd in fact, blood glucose\nisn't really the goal.\nIf you recall, the goal is to get neurons\nto be metabolically active\nwith that blood glucose, okay?\nThat's what's actually rewarded\nat a sub-sub-conscious level,\nmeaning at a deep subconscious level.\nBut consuming these foods with other foods\nthat increase blood glucose,\nand thereby, brain metabolism,\nor I suppose, if you're ketogenic,\nhere in the ketosis,\nI don't know what the range of foods\nthat are allowed on ketosis are,\nso I don't want to misspeak here,\nand say, cracker, which\nwould probably be a sin\nin the context of ketosis,\nand no knock against ketosis.\nI'm offering this, in part,\nbecause I think that there are\na number of people that have\nand can positively benefit\nfrom a ketogenic diet.\nBut for instance,\nif there's a food that you\nwant to consume more of,\nbut that you find somewhat\nmeh, or mildly yuh, yuck,\neven pairing it with ketones,\nif indeed, you are using ketones\nfor your brain metabolism,\n'cause that's what happens\non the ketogenic diet,\nover time, that food will be reinforced\nby the dopamine pathway.\nWe know this from these studies\nwhere sucralose was the\nsubstance paired with\nthe glucose elevating.\nIn other words, metabolically\nelevating the food substance,\nor liquid substance.\nSo how does one go about doing this?\nWell, first of all, I want to emphasize,\nthat this experiment\nactually has been done\nin a slightly different context.\nStudies by my colleague, Alia Crum,\nin the Psychology Department at Stanford\nhave explored the bodily response,\nin terms of insulin release,\nand the release of other food\nand eating-related hormones,\nas well as overall feelings\nof satisfaction, et cetera,\nin groups of people\nthat drink a milkshake,\nand are either told that\nit's a low calorie shake\nthat contains various nutrients\nthat are good for them,\nor a higher calorie shake\nthat has a lot of nutrients, et cetera.\nAnd what they found,\nwas that the different groups,\nand here, again, I'm being very general\nwith my description of these studies,\nbut what they found, is that\nthe physiological response,\nthe insulin response, the\nblood glucose response,\nand the subjective measures\nof whether or not people\nenjoyed something or not,\nwere heavily influenced\nby what they were told\nwere in these milkshakes.\nSo blood glucose would go up.\nInsulin would go up\nwhen people were told it\nwas a high calorie shake\nwith lots of nutrients.\nLess so when people\ningested a shake that was,\nyou know, that they were\ntold had less nutrients,\nand so forth.\nWhen in reality, it was\nthe identical shake.\nThis is incredible.\nThis is a belief effect.\nThis is not placebo, right?\nA placebo effect is different.\nPlacebo effect is in comparison.\nIt's where the control condition actually\ninfluences outcomes to a same,\nor to some degree, just like\nthe experimental condition.\nThis is not a placebo effect.\nThis is a belief effect,\nwhere the belief and the\nsubjective thoughts about\nwhat a given food will do\nhas a direct impact on\na physiological measure,\nlike blood sugar and blood glucose.\nOkay, so let's zoom out\nfrom this for a second,\nand think about how we\ncan incorporate this\ninto adopting consumption of healthy foods\nthat serve our brain health in\nthe immediate and long-term.\nAnd if you're wondering what those are,\nI listed them out at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nand their justification\nfor being on that list.\nWhat this means is,\nobviously, you want to\nconsume foods that you like,\nbut because brain health\nis very important,\nand many of the foods\nthat promote brain health,\nperhaps, are not the most palatable to you\nor desirable to you,\nthe key would be to ingest the foods\nthat you want to ingest more of\nsimply because they're good for you,\nand not because they taste good to you,\nalongside foods that increase\nwhatever fuel system you\nhappen to be relying on.\nI think that's the most nutritionally\npolitically correct way to say it.\nSo if you're keto,\nthat would mean ketones, okay?\nIf you're not ketogenic,\nand I think most people\nprobably are not in ketosis,\nor trying to maintain ketosis,\nbut for instance,\npeople that are on a\npurely plant-based diet,\nthat would be one set of foods.\nFor people that are omnivores,\na different set of foods.\nAnd for people that are carnivores,\nyet another set of foods.\nIf you want to eat more\nof a particular food\nbecause it's good for you,\npair it with something in the same meal.\nYou don't have to hide it physically,\nor in the flavor sense.\nYou don't have to hide it\nwithin that other food,\nbut pair it with that other food\nthat provides you a shift\nin brain metabolism,\nbecause that's really what\nyour brain and you are seeking,\neven though you don't realize it.\nHow long will this take?\nWell, according to the\ndata in humans on sucralose\nand the conditioning for\nsucralose to have these effects,\nwhich, in many cases,\nwere detrimental, right?\nBecause they were increasing insulin.\nBut in this case, you're trying to\nhijack this conditioning\nof food preference\nfor healthy purposes,\nnot with sucralose,\nbut by ingesting things\nthat are good for you,\nthen the data really point to the fact\nthat even within a short period\nof time of about seven days,\nbut certainly within 14 days,\nthat food will take on\na subjective experience\nof tasting at least better\nto you, if not good to you.\nNow, I believe this has\nimportant implications\nfor much of the controversy\nand food wars that we see out there.\nFood wars being, of course,\nthese groups that ardently\nsubscribe to the idea\nthat their diet and the\nthings that they are eating\nare the foods that are good for us,\nand that are the most pleasureful,\nand the things that\neveryone should be eating.\nWe see this with every community\nwithin the nutrition realm.\nNow, of course, there are\nstudies that point to the fact\nthat certain foods and food\ncomponents are healthier,\nprobably for us and for the planet,\nbut you really see it on\nboth ends of the spectrum.\nYou've got people who are\non a pure carnivore diet\nwho are arguing with a\nlot of biomedical evidence\nthat that's what's best\nfor us and beneficial.\nAnd then you've got\npeople that are arguing\nthe same general sets of arguments,\nbut for a purely plant-based diet.\nAnd then I think most people\nfall into the omnivore category.\nWhat's very clear, however,\nis that what we consume on a regular basis\nand what leads to increases\nin brain metabolism\nleads to increases in dopamine,\nand thereby our motivation to eat them.\nSo what this really says,\nis that what we tend to do regularly\nbecomes reinforcing in and of itself.\nAnd I think, in large part,\ncan explain the fact that,\nyes, indeed, for certain people,\na given diet not only feels good,\nbut they heavily subscribe to the nutrient\nand kind of health beneficial\neffects of that diet.\nAnd they often will\nprovide evidence for that,\nwhether or not you ask them for it or not.\nBut that's true of every subcategory\nwithin the nutrition realm.\nAgain, this is not to take away\nfrom some of the beautiful data\nemphasizing that certain foods,\nand micronutrients, et cetera,\nare better for us, or worse\nfor us, and for the planet.\nThat's not a debate I want\nto get into right now.\nWhat this emphasizes,\nis that foods impact our\nbrain and its health,\nbut they also impact\nhow our brain functions\nand responds to food,\nand that is largely a learned response.\nWe can't completely\noverride, for instance,\nthat certain foods evoke a\nstrong, [grunts] yuck component.\nCertain foods are truly putrid to us.\nI should just say, certain\nthings are putrid to us,\nand we should not consume them, right?\nAt the far end of the spectrum,\nit's hard-wired for us to avoid those,\nbecause they can be dangerous for us.\nThey can make us very, very sick.\nBut it's also true,\nthat if we continue to eat foods\nthat are progressively sweeter and sweeter\nand highly palatable,\nit shifts our dopamine system,\nbecause it activates our dopamine system\nto make us believe that those foods\nare the only foods that can\ntrigger this reward system,\nand make us feel good,\nand that they taste good.\nBut after consuming foods\nthat perhaps are less sweet\nor even less savory,\nthat are not what we would call highly,\nor I would say, nowadays,\nit's super palatable foods,\nwe can adjust our sense literally\nof what we perceive as an\nattractive and rewarding food,\nand indeed, the dopamine system\nwill reward those foods accordingly.\nI can't emphasize enough\nhow much this learning\nof associated food reward\nis important for not just understanding\nwhy we like the foods that we eat,\nand how to eat more of foods\nthat are healthy for us,\nand enjoy them,\nbut it also speaks to the fact\nthat our brain, as a whole,\nis a perceptual device\ntrying to make guesses\nor estimations about\nwhat certain foods are going to do for us.\nSo put simply,\nwe don't just like sweet\nfoods because they taste good,\nwe like them because they predict\na certain kind of metabolic response.\nThis is important also,\nbecause Dana Small, and Ivan de Araujo,\nand others have been exploring\nwhether or not people, for instance,\nthat have type 2 diabetes,\nor that suffer from any number\nof different metabolic disorders,\nwhether or not somehow\nthese food reward systems\nare permanently disrupted,\nand through a beautiful set of experiments\nthat have been done by mainly\nby Dana Small's group at Yale,\nbut also by the de\nAraujo group and others,\nexploring how the reward\npathways are altered\nin various metabolic disorders, et cetera,\npeople suffering from type 2 diabetes.\nWe don't have time to go\ninto all those data now,\nbut the takeaway is,\nthat food preference,\nand the ability to reshape these circuits\nis not disrupted in these people\nto the point where it can't be rewired,\nand that's very encouraging,\nbecause what it means is that,\nfor people that are suffering\nfrom these syndromes,\nthrough some simple\nalterations in dietary choice,\nprovided those are carried out over time\nand in the correct way,\nby pairing with the foods\nthat will appropriately\nshift metabolism of the brain,\none can actually rewire what they consider\nnot just palatable,\nbut attractive as foods.\nIf you want to learn\nmore about food reward\nand food reinforcement,\n'cause it turns out, those\nare slightly different things,\nthere's a wonderful review\nwritten by Ivan de Araujo.\nThey have a middle author,\nMark Schachter, and Dana Small.\nIt's called \"Rethinking Food Reward\",\nand it was published in the\n\"Annual Reviews of Psychology\".\nYou can find it very easily online.\nIt was published in 2019.\nAnd it's a beautiful, deep dive,\nalthough, quite accessible to most people,\nabout how different foods,\nand the way that we perceive them\nimpacts our brain and body,\nand why we like the things we like,\nand how to reshape what we like.\nSo once again, we've done a\nfairly extensive deep dive\ninto food and your brain,\nfocusing first on how particular foods\nand compounds within foods\nthat are available also\nthrough supplementation\ncan impact immediate and\nlong-term brain health.\nCame up with a relatively short list\nof what I would call super foods,\nonly because there are\nample data to support\ntheir role in enhancing short\nand long-term cognition,\nand neuronal health, and so on.\nAnd we also talked about food preference,\nand why particular tastes,\nand particular events within the gut,\nand particular events\nwithin the brain combine\nto lead us to pursue particular foods,\nand to avoid other foods,\nand how you can leverage those pathways\nin order to pursue more of the foods\nthat are going to be\ngood for you, and good,\nnot just for your brain,\nbut for your overall body health,\nand to enjoy them along the way.\nIf you're learning from, and\nare enjoying this

supplements.\nOne of the major issues with supplements\nis that supplement\ncompanies don't always have\nthe highest quality standards,\nand/or the amounts of the supplements\nthat they list on the bottle\naren't what actually are\ncontained in the capsules,\nand pills, and powders\nof those supplements.\nFor that reason, we partner\nwith Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne has the\nhighest levels of stringency\nwith respect to the quality\nof the supplements they use,\nand the quantity of the\nsupplements they use.\nThey partnered with all\nthe major sports teams,\nand with the Mayo Clinic,\nand we have tremendous confidence\nin the quality of their supplements.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman.\nThere, you can get 20% off\nany of those supplements.\nAnd if you navigate into the main site\nthrough that portal of\nthorne.com/u/huberman,\nyou can also get 20% off any\nof the supplements that Thorne makes.\nAnd
