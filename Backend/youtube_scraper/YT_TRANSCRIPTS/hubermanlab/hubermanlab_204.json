    "transcript": "[offbeat uplifting music]\n- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're talking all about fasting.\nAnd anytime we're talking about fasting,\nwe are also talking about eating,\nbecause we all need to\neat sooner or later.\nWe're going to talk about how fasting\nand when we eat influences\na large range of aspects\nof our health and wellbeing,\nboth physical and mental.\nSo, well, nowadays,\nmost people are familiar with\nthe term intermittent fasting,\nalso sometimes called\ntime-restricted feeding.\nI think most people\ndon't really understand\nhow that process works.\nIt's sort of obvious that\nintermittent fasting,\naka time-restricted feeding,\ninvolves eating at certain\nperiods of each 24-hour cycle,\nor maybe even not eating for\nentire days, in some cases.\nBut, if you think about it,\neverybody sleeps eventually.\nAnd therefore, because people\ndon't eat during their sleep,\nalmost everybody is employing some form\nof intermittent fasting or\ntime-restricted feeding.\nWhat we're going to talk about today\nis how particular schedules\nof time restricted feeding\ncan impact our health in different ways.\nAnd when I say different ways, I mean,\nwe're going to talk about\nhow intermittent fasting,\naka time-restricted feeding,\nimpacts weight loss,\nfat loss in particular,\nmuscle maintenance, and\nloss and gain, organ health,\nsuch as gut health and\nliver health, the genome,\nthe epigenome, inflammation,\nsickness, recovery,\nand healing from sickness,\nexercise, cognition,\nmood, and lifespan.\nSo we're going to cover a\ntremendous amount of information.\nI promise to make it\nall directly accessible,\nregardless of whether or not you have\na background in biology and\nmetabolic science or not.\nI'm also going to talk\nabout a lot of tools.\nIn fact, I'm going to discuss\na number of tools during today's episode\nthat actually make it such\nthat you don't have to\nfollow any feeding schedule,\nor fasting schedule, same thing\nif you think about it,\nin any absolutely strict regimented way,\nmeaning if you were to only\neat during an eight hour period\nof each day, most of the time,\nbut then occasionally eat\nacross a 12 hour period\nof the day,\nin theory, that could\nactually have pretty serious\ndetrimental health effects.\nAnd yet, there are things that you can do\nto attenuate those negative effects.\nIn fact,\nthere are things that\nyou can do and or take\nthat can make it as if\nyou did not eat at all.\nAnd so we'll discuss what those tools are.\nAnd in many cases, for sake\nof health, weight loss,\nand performance,\nmaking the body think that\nit did not eat at all can\nactually be quite beneficial.\nSo today, we're going to cover mechanism\nand we're going to cover tools.\nBefore we do that,\nI want to highlight a particular\nresult that was published\nrecently, because it\nserves as a useful backbone\nas we wade into the\nconversation about fasting.\nThis is a study that was published\nin the journal Cell Metabolism:\nA Cell Press Journal,\nexcellent journal.\nAnd the title of the paper\nis \"Fasting Blood Glucose\nas a Predictor of Mortality:\nLost in Translation\".\nAnd I'll explain what\nthe \"Lost in Translation\"\npart means in a moment.\nBut the basic takeaway of this study,\nand I should mention that\nthe first author of the\nstudy is Palliyaguru,\nPALLIYAGURU, guru,\nPalliyaguru, et al.\nThe basic finding of the\nstudy is that in humans,\nhigher blood glucose is\nassociated with mortality.\nAnd in fact, if you look at blood glucose,\nresting blood glucose across the lifespan,\nwhat you find is as people age,\nresting blood glucose goes up.\nNow, this is very interesting,\nbecause for a long time it was thought\nthat metabolism actually\ngoes down as we age.\nAnd to some extent, that's true,\nbut the reductions in metabolism\nare not nearly as robust\nas we once thought\nthat they were across the lifespan.\nHowever, unless there's something done\nto mitigate the increase\nin blood glucose associated\nwith the aging,\nalmost everybody experiences a gradual,\nbut regular increase in\nresting blood glucose\nthat predicts mortality.\nNow, the title, as I mentioned,\nis \"Fasting Blood Glucose\nas a Predictor of Mortality:\nLost in Translation\".\nAnd the reason that they\nincluded \"Lost in Translation\"\nin the title is that what I just told you,\nthat increases in resting blood\nglucose predict mortality, or\nare correlated with mortality,\nis true for human beings\nand for non-human primates, monkeys.\nBut the opposite is true in mice.\nAnd so I thought it was important\nto use this study as an example\nof where it studies in mice often,\nbut not always, translate to humans\nand to non-human primates.\nSo today, I'm going to be careful\nto distinguish when a study\nwas performed in mice versus in humans,\nbecause it seems that at\nleast when discussing feeding,\nblood glucose and other aspects of diet\nas they relate to health and wellbeing,\nwhether or not a study\nwas performed in rodents\nor in humans can be very important.\nIn this case,\nthe results were directly\n180 degrees opposite\nto one another.\nIn other words, in mice,\nresting blood glucose went down,\nand was associated with mortality.\nSo lower blood glucose\nassociated with mortality.\nWhereas in humans,\nhigher resting blood glucose\nwas associated with mortality.\nAnd obviously,\nwhat we're mostly interested in is health\nand wellbeing of ourselves, of humans.\nI'm sure there are some people\nout there that are intensely\nconcerned about the health\nand wellbeing of mice,\nwhich you could imagine\na few rare contexts\nwhere that's important,\nbut obviously most of us are\ninterested in human health.\nSo I'll be sure to emphasize\nwhen studies were performed\nin humans versus in mice.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however,\npart of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost\nto consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat are the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system\nand how we see, and ROKA,\nwhich is a company developed\nby two all-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford has developed eyeglasses\nand sunglasses that take into\naccount the science of vision,\nand they've produced an\nabsolutely terrific product.\nThat product involves glasses\nthat, first of all, are very lightweight.\nSecond of all, can be worn\nwhen performing any activity.\nThey really are performance\neyeglasses and sunglasses.\nSo whether or not you're sweating\nor running around,\nwhether or not you're working,\nwhether or not you're hiking,\ncycling, et cetera,\nyou can wear them for\nessentially any activity.\nThe nice thing is they also\nhave a great aesthetic.\nSo unlike a lot of other performance\nsunglasses and eyeglasses out there\nthat can make people\nlook more or less like\ncyborgs, ROKA eyeglasses\nand sunglasses look great,\nwhether or not you're wearing\nthem to dinner or at work,\nor whether or not you're headed out\nfor a run or a cycle or\nsomething of that sort.\nAs I mentioned before,\nthey're extremely lightweight.\nThey don't slip off.\nAnd that's true,\nregardless of what activity\nyou're engaging in.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nglasses, you can go

platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body and help\nyou meet your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the processes\nthat are occurring in your body\nthat impact your immediate and\nlong-term health can only be assessed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of modern DNA tests,\nyou can also assess your genome\nand how that's impacting your immediate\nand long-term health.\nThe problem with a lot\nof blood and DNA tests\nis you get information back,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nAnd InsideTracker has solved that problem.\nThey have a very easy to use dashboard\nso that when you get your results back,\nit will tell you, for instance,\nif your levels of a\nparticular metabolic factor\nor hormone are too high or too low,\nwhat you can do, what you can take,\nhow you can change your nutrition\nin order to adjust those levels\nand get them where you want them to be.\nThis is tremendously useful\nand takes all the guesswork out\nof what to do with biomarker information.\nIf you'd

Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses\nand pillows that are tailored\nto your unique sleep needs,\nand in doing so, provide\nthe best sleep possible.\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\nabout a year or so ago,\nand it is the best sleep\nthat I've ever had.\nIf you go to the Helix site,\nyou take a brief two minute quiz,\nand that quiz asks you questions such as,\ndo you tend to sleep on your stomach,\nyour side, or your back?\nDo you tend to run hot\nor cold during the night?\nMaybe you don't know,\nand they match you to\na particular mattress\nthat's ideal for your sleep needs.\nIn my case, I matched to\nthe so-called Dusk mattress.\nI've been sleeping on a Dusk\nmattress, and as I mentioned,\nit's absolutely terrific.\nBest sleep I've ever had.\nIt's really key to get a mattress\nthat's best suited to you.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\nyou can go to HelixSleep.com,\ntake that two minute quiz,\nand they'll match you to a\ncustomized mattress for you.\nAnd you'll get up to $200 off\nany of your mattress orders,\nand you'll get two free pillows.\nIf you're interested in Helix Sleep,\nyou can go to HelixSleep.com/huberman,\nand you get up to $200 off your mattress,\nand two free pillows.\nI'd like to point you\ntoward a valuable resource\nthat's also zero cost and\nis available now online.\nThis is an event that was recorded.\nThe event was held by Logitech,\nand I was fortunate enough\nto partake in this event.\nAnd the entire event\nwas centered around how\nto be a more effective learner\nand teacher using the modern\nprinciples of neuroplasticity.\nSo at the link in the\ncaption for this episode,\nyou can go to what was called\nthe Rethink Education Event.\nAnd there, I gave a seminar\nof about 20 or 30 minutes\ndescribing the modern\nneuroscience of neuroplasticity,\nthe nervous system's ability\nto change in response to experience.\nI focused mainly on human studies\nand how different structures\nand different things,\nand tools that one can\nimplement in the classroom and outside\nof the classroom can lead to\nfaster and more pervasive,\nlonger lasting learning of\nmotor skills, music skills,\nmathematical skills,\nlanguage skills, et cetera,\nall based on quality\npeer reviewed research.\nSo if you'd like to check that out,\nyou can head to that link.\nYou'll also see an example of\nsome of those tools in action,\nin a music classroom of a\nphenomenal music teacher,\nBen Edie, who's a teacher out in Pasadena,\nwho has applied these tools,\nat least to my knowledge,\nfor the first time ever.\nOf course, all the tools\nthat are there are listed out\nin what I call a\nplasticity super protocol,\nand all those tools can be applied\nto learning and teaching in\nany format that you like.\nSo check it out.\nIt's in the caption to\nthis week's episode,\nand it will remain there,\nit's up on YouTube and\nI hope you enjoy it.\nOkay, so let's talk\nabout feeding, fasting,\nhealth and performance.\nAnd I want to just establish\na few foundational terms\nso that we're all on the same page.\nFirst of all,\nrather than talk about fasting\nor time restricted feeding,\nI'm largely going to talk\nabout time restricted feeding,\nbut please understand that\ntime restricted feeding\nis just one side of the coin\nthat is a two-sided coin\nthat includes fasting on the one hand,\nnot eating, and time restricted\nfeeding on the other hand,\nI may occasionally say fasting,\nbut because fasting and\neating establish different\nbiological conditions in the body,\ntime-restricted feeding\nis the term that I will use to describe\nthe overall plan of\nrestricting one's eating window\nas it's called to a particular\nphase of each 24 hour day,\nor in some cases two particular\ndays within the week.\nBecause as you'll soon learn,\nthere are aspects of\ntime restricted feeding,\naka fasting, that involve\neating every other day,\nor eating one way for five days\nand then fasting for\ntwo days, and so forth.\nSo I'll be very precise about\nwhat I mean and why I mean it.\nBut for the time being,\nI'm going to refer to\ntime restricted feeding\nas a way to put an umbrella\nover this conversation.\nSecond of all,\nI am going to emphasize a\nlot of biological mechanism.\nIf you've listened to this podcast before,\nyou know that I always begin\nwith biological mechanism.\nI do describe tools of how to\nimplement those mechanisms,\nbut I wholeheartedly believe\nthat knowing mechanisms\nand understanding how these processes work\ngives you tremendous\nflexibility and understanding,\nand control over the processes\nof your mental and physical health.\nWhereas if I were to just list off a menu\nof things to do and not\nto do, those will work,\nbut those will not give you the kind\nof understanding that would allow you\nto navigate through life, through travel,\nthrough dinners out, through\ndifferent exercise schedules,\nwhether or not you're one age\nor another age, male, female,\net cetera, I'm giving you mechanisms\nso that you can gain more\ncontrol over the systems\nin your brain and body.\nEverything's timestamped,\nso if you want to jump to the to do's,\nyou can certainly do that,\nbut I encourage you to hang in\nthere for the mechanism bit.\nI will make it all very clear\nbecause if you understand mechanism,\nyou are in a true place\nof power and control\nover your biology.\nIf ever there was a topic\nthat is controversial,\nespecially on the internet,\nit is that of diet and nutrition.\nSo I'm wading into this\nwith a smile and in eager\nanticipation of all the but but but this\nand but but but that, and wait,\nbut this showed that.\nHere's the deal,\nwe need to precisely define\nwhat it is that we're talking about\nwhen we talk about nutrition.\nI'm going to give you an example\nof a study that was\npublished a few years ago,\n2018, by a colleague of mine at Stanford,\nChris Gardner, he's a terrific professor\nof nutrition and has done a lot\nof important studies on\nhow nutrition impacts\ndifferent aspects of health.\nThis is a large-scale study.\nIt was published in JAMA,\nthe Journal of the American\nMedical Association,\none of the very top tier\njournals in the area of medicine,\nand certainly for a paper on nutrition\nto show up there meant that it had\nto meet an exceedingly high standard.\nThis paper, where Chris\nis the first author,\nit's Gardner et al, 2018 JAMA,\nlooked at weight loss\nin people following one\nparticular diet versus\nanother particular diet.\nAnd this was a 12 month weight loss study.\nSo it was focused\nspecifically on weight loss,\nalthough they looked at some\nother parameters as well.\nAnd the basic conclusion of the study was\nthat there was no significant difference\nin weight change between\npeople following a healthy,\nlow fat diet versus a healthy,\nlow carbohydrate diet with significantly\nmore dietary fats in them.\nThis caused a lot of ripples\nin the world of nutrition\nand nutritional science,\nand certainly in the general population,\nbecause anyone that understands diet\nand nutrition would\nimmediately say, but wait,\nthere are all sorts of\ndifferent implications of eating\none type of diet, say low\ncarbohydrate, higher fats,\nversus a higher\ncarbohydrate, lower fat diet.\nAnd indeed there are.\nThis study was focused specifically\non fat loss and on weight loss.\nSo as we discuss time restricted feeding,\nwe need to be very precise\nabout what are the effects\nof time restricted feeding,\nand of eating in particular ways\nat particular times, we are\ngoing to emphasize again,\nwhether or not the study was\ndone in mice or in humans,\nin athletes, in men, in women, or both,\nbut the study from Gardner and colleagues\nis a beautiful study,\nand really emphasizes that\nif one's main goal is\nsimply to lose weight,\nthen it really does not\nmatter what one eats provided\nthat the number of calories burned\nis higher than the number\nof calories ingested.\nHowever, anyone out there who understands\na little bit of biology,\nor a lot of biology will agree\nthat there are many factors\nthat impact that calories\nburned part of the equation.\nSome of those are obvious.\nSo for instance,\namount of exercise, type of\nexercise, basal metabolic rate,\nhow much energy one\nburns just sitting there.\nI've talked before on this podcast\nabout NEIT, Non Exercise\nInduced Thermogenesis,\nwhere if people bounce around\na lot and fidget a lot,\nthey can burn anywhere from\n800 to 2,000 calories per day.\nSo their quote-unquote\nbasal metabolic rate\nis actually much higher simply\nbecause they're fidgeters,\nwhereas people who tend\nto be more stationary\nhave a lower basal\nmetabolic rate, on average.\nThere's a great science to support this.\nMetabolic factors and hormones\nare also very important.\nHormones, such as thyroid hormone\nand insulin and growth hormone,\nand the sex story to hormones,\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nthose levels will also\nprofoundly influence\nthe calories out, the\ncalories burned component\nof the calories in, calories out equation.\nSo if out there on the internet\nor in listening to a particular podcast\nor speaker, somebody says,\nthis is the ideal diet,\nor calories in, calories out does not\nmatter, or calories in calories out\nis the only thing that matters.\nI think it's very important to understand\nthat there are some foundational truths,\nsuch as calories in, calories out,\nbut that of course,\nhormone factors and the context in which\na given diet regimen is taking place\nare exceedingly important.\nA good example of this would be puberty\nat that time in life,\nsex steroid hormones\nare changing profoundly\nin the body as our growth\nhormone and other hormones.\nAnd much of caloric intake\nis directed towards protein synthesis,\ntowards the production of muscle and bone\nand other tissues of the body.\nAnd that's because of changes in hormones\nthat we call puberty.\nSo, there's no way that we can drill\ninto every aspect of a given feeding plan\nor feeding schedule that would allow us\nto tap into every aspect of the list\nthat I read out before weight loss,\nfat loss, muscle organ, genome, epigenome,\ninflammation, exercise,\ncognition, mood, and lifespan.\nBut today, we're going to be very precise\nabout how time restricted feeding,\nit's very clear from both animal studies\nand human studies\ncan have a very powerful\nand positive impact\non everything from weight loss\nand fat loss to various health parameters.\nThis is a beautiful literature\nthat's emerged mostly in\nthe last 10 or 15 years.\nAnd as we march into this literature,\nwhat you'll see is that there actually\nis a perfect diet for you on a given day.\nAnd that perfect diet for you on\na given day is contextual,\nmeaning it depends on\nwhat you did yesterday\nand what you're going to do tomorrow.\nSo there is a perfect diet for you.\nAnd today, I'm going to arm you\nwith the mechanisms and understanding\nthat will allow you to define what\nthat perfect diet is\nand will allow you to eat on a schedule\nand to eat the things that are going\nto best serve your goals.\nSo let's talk about eating\nand what happens when you eat,\nand let's talk about\nfasting, or not eating,\nand what happens when you fast.\nI did an entire episode on eating\nand metabolism, and\nhormones and other factors\nthat impact appetite.\nWe don't have time to go\ninto all those details now,\nalthough you're welcome to\nlisten to that episode as well,\nbut we can briefly describe\nthe overall conditions\nthat are set in the body when we eat\nand when we don't eat.\nThe key word here is conditions.\nIf I can emphasize anything\ntoday, it's that what you eat\nand when you eat it set\nconditions in your body,\nand those conditions can\nbe very good for you,\nor very bad for you,\ndepending on when you eat.\nIn fact, when you eat is as\nimportant as what you eat.\nI'll repeat that, when you eat\nis as important as what you eat,\nat least as it relates\nto health parameters,\nin particular, liver\nhealth and mental health.\nSome simple rules about eating.\nFirst of all, when you eat,\ntypically your blood glucose,\nyour blood sugar, will go up.\nAlso, insulin levels will go up.\nInsulin is a hormone that's involved\nin mobilizing glucose\nfrom the bloodstream.\nHow much your glucose and insulin go up\ndepends on what you eat\nand how much you eat.\nIn general, simple sugars,\nincluding fructose from fruit,\nbut also sucrose and glucose,\nand simple sugars will raise your insulin\nand blood glucose more\nthan complex carbohydrates.\nThings like grains, and breads,\nand pastas, and so forth,\nand grains, and breads, and\npastas, and so forth will raise\nyour blood glucose more\nthan fibrous carbohydrates,\nlike lettuce, and broccoli,\nand things of that sort.\nProtein has a somewhat moderate\nor modest impact on insulin and glucose,\nand fat has the lowest impact\non raising your blood\nglucose and blood insulin.\nSo what you eat will\nimpact how steep a rise\nin blood glucose and insulin takes place.\nAnd there are a number of factors\nthat are related to your individual health\nthat will also dictate how steep\nand how high that rise in\nglucose and insulin will be.\nFor the time being, I'm leaving\nout people who have type one diabetes.\nThese are people that don't\nmanufacture their own insulin,\nand type two diabetes is\nessentially insulin insensitivity,\nlack of sensitivity to insulin,\nwhich leads to high blood glucose.\nBut, when you eat,\nblood glucose goes up\nand when you don't eat,\nblood glucose and insulin go down.\nThe longer it's been since your last meal,\nthe lower, typically,\nyour blood glucose and insulin will be.\nAnd the higher, things like\nGLP1, glucagon-like peptide 1,\nglucagon being a hormone\nthat's also secreted\nwhen you are in a fasted state\nor a low blood glucose state.\nIt's involved in mobilizing\nvarious energy sources\nfrom the body, including fat\nthrough what we call lipolysis,\nalso using carbohydrates,\nand potentially even using\nmuscle as a source of energy.\nSo, that's kind of a fire hose\nof information about what happens\nwhen you eat and don't eat,\nbut just think of it this way, blood sugar\nand insulin go up when you eat,\nthey go down when you don't eat,\nand other hormones go\nup when you don't eat.\nSo there are hormones associated\nwith the fasted state,\nand there are hormones associated\nwith the eating and\nhaving just eaten state.\nNow, the most important thing\nto understand is that,\nlike everything in biology,\nthis is a process that takes time.\nSo insulin and glucose go up when we eat,\nand it takes some period of time\nfor them to go down,\neven if we stop eating,\nthey will remain up for\nsome period of time,\nand then go back down, it takes time.\nThis is very important,\nbecause if you look at\nthe scientific literature\non fasting, on time-restricted feeding,\nit's absolutely clear\nthat the health benefits,\nnot just the weight loss benefits,\nbut that the health benefits\nfrom time-restricted feeding,\noccur because certain conditions\nare met in the brain and body\nfor a certain amount of time.\nAnd that gives us an anchor\nfrom which to view what eating\nis in terms of how it sets\nconditions in the body over time.\nAnd if that sounds overly\nanalytic, I promise you,\nthis is the simplest\nand best way to think\nabout any eating schedule\nor any eating plan.\nSo I think it's fair to say\nthat in the field of nutrition,\nthere are a few landmark\nstudies that serve\nas really strong anchors for\nbuilding our understanding\nof what to eat and what not to eat\nand when to eat, depending on our goals.\nThe Gardner study that I mentioned earlier\nis one such study,\nin that it says if your\ngoal is weight loss,\nit really does not matter\nwhat foods you consume,\nprovided that you consume a\nsub-maintenance, caloric diet.\nHowever, I want to emphasize again,\nthat sets aside issues of adherence,\nmeaning how easy or hard it\nis to adhere to a given diet.\nSome people find it much easier\nto follow a high fat,\nlow carbohydrate diet.\nSome people fall follow\na different diet because it's much easier\nfor them to follow.\nAnd some people are concerned\nwith mental performance\nand athletic performance.\nSo that study doesn't\nsay there's a best diet,\nwhat it says is that what you consume\nis less important than the\namount of food that you consume,\nat least for sake of weight loss,\nnot necessarily for sake of health.\nNow, the study that I'm going\nto refer to next is what I would consider\nthe second major pillar\nof nutritional studies.\nThis is a truly landmark study\nthat was carried out by Satchin Panda,\nwho is a professor at the Salk Institute\nof Biological Studies in San Diego,\nan absolutely phenomenal institution,\nand an absolutely phenomenal researcher.\nI've known Satchin for a number of years,\nand I want to emphasize\nthat the current literature\non intermittent fasting\nand time restricted feeding can largely\nbe attributed to Satchin\nand the work that he's done.\nThere are others involved too, of course.\nAnd of course, time-restricted feeding\nand fasting has a rich history\nthat goes back many hundreds,\nif not thousands of years\nin different cultures\nand religions,\nbut the science of time-restricted\nfeeding can really mainly\nbe attributed to the incredible\nwork that Satchin has done.\nAnd I'm grateful to consider\nhim a friend and a colleague,\nand we consulted at length in\nanticipation of this episode.\nI also hope to have him on\nas a guest in the future.\nThe landmark paper that\ncame from Satchin's lab\nwas published in 2012.\nThis was a paper in\nmice that set the basis\nfor studies in humans that came later.\nAnd the title of this paper\nis time-restricted feeding\nwithout reducing caloric intake,\nprevents metabolic diseases\nin mice fed a high fat diet.\nSo the title tells us a lot.\nIt says that what's varied in this study\nis not what these mice ate,\nit was when they ate it.\nAnd there were essentially four conditions\nin this study and the results\nare absolutely remarkable.\nSo I'm going to walk you\nthrough the major results.\nWhat they did is they gave mice access\nto different types of food.\nThere were four groups,\none group of mice had access\nto just a normal mouse diet.\nIt would not be a diet that\nyou'd be very interested in.\nI confess I've actually tasted mouse chow.\nIf you work with mice at\nall, you just have to do it.\nAt least once it doesn't taste very good,\nit tastes like a very bland\nGraham cracker cookie.\nAnd I confessed that. I only\nhad the tiniest little bit,\nbut mice like that stuff.\nAnd if you allow them to eat that stuff,\nwhat's called ad libitum\nwhenever they want,\nyou just keep it in their\nfood. 24 hours a day,\nthey will eat sometimes,\nand then they won't eat it at\nother times, or in this case,\nthey also had a condition where\nthey gave them mouse chow in\na time restricted way,\njust for a certain\nnumber of hours each day,\nbut about eight hours, or they\ngave them a high-fat diet.\nThat was a separate group,\ngot a high-fat diet at\nany time they wanted.\nSo this was kind of the\ncarnival for mice because mice\nreally like high fat,\nhighly palatable foods.\nAnd so they got a lot of\ngoodies and high-fat in their\nfood.\nAnd then there was a fourth\ngroup that had access to the\nhigh fat diet as much\nas they wanted to eat,\nbut only during a restricted\ntime period of each 24 hour\ncycle, now mice are nocturnal.\nHumans are what we call diurnal, actually,\nwe're not really diurnal\nwe're crepuscular,\nwhich means that we're most\nactive in the morning and in the\nevening, not so much in the\nafternoon, but nonetheless,\neverything I'm going to tell\nyou is true also for humans.\nAnd we know this now from human studies,\none of the most important\nthings to take away from this\nstudy was that mice that ate\na highly palatable high-fat\ndiet, a great tasting diet,\nbut only during a restricted\nfeeding window of each 24 hour\ncycle maintained or lost\nweight over time, whereas mice\nthat ingested the same diet,\nsame amount of calories,\nbut had access to those\ncalories around the clock,\ngained weight, became\nobese and quite sick.\nAnd as an additional second point,\nthe mice that restricted\ntheir feeding window to a\nparticular portion of eight\nhours of every 24 hour cycle\nactually showed some\nimprovement in important health\nmarkers.\nAnd what was even more incredible\nis that mice that only ate\nduring a particular feeding window,\nalso experienced some reversal\nof some prior negative health\neffects.\nSo this study really lit up the\nworld and got people excited\nabout time-restricted eating again.\nThey use an eight hour feeding window.\nThe story around that eight\nhour feeding window is kind of\ninteresting though.\nNot many people know this\nbecause it wasn't included in the\npaper, and there was no reason\nto include it in the paper,\nnot to out anybody,\nbut it turns out that the\nreason they used an eight hour\nfeeding window and not a nine\nhour or a 10 hour feeding\nwindow,\nis because studies of this sort\nare actually quite demanding\nto perform and require the\nconstant presence of the graduate\nstudent,\nor post-doc there to ensure\nthat the food is in the cages at\nparticular times and not in\nthe cages at other times.\nAnd mice are really good at hiding food.\nThey'll even hide food in their jowls.\nAnd so there's a lot of work\nthat has to be done to prepare\nfor that eight hour feeding window.\nAnd to make sure after that\neight hour feeding window,\nthere's all the food has been\nremoved from the cage and from\nthe jowls of the mice and so forth.\nAnd it turns out that the\nsignificant other of the graduate\nstudent and or postdoc,\nI won't reveal who they were running.\nThis study forbid their significant other,\nthe scientist from being in\nthe lab for periods of time,\nthat were much longer than\nthe 10 or 12 hours that were\nrequired in order to ensure\nthis eight hour feeding window.\nSo when we hear the eight\nhour feeding windows are holy,\nthey are not holy and later,\nwe are going to talk about\nhow eating for a time that's\nrestricted to eight hours\nversus 10 hours versus 12 hours.\nFor instance,\nhow that impacts various\nparameters like health parameters\nand weight loss, et cetera.\nBut the eight hour feeding\nwindow was actually created\nbecause of a real world\nconstraint on the research and the\nrelationship with the researcher\nperforming the research,\nnot because there's anything\nholy about an eight hour\nfeeding window, now\nan important point about\nwhen the feeding window falls\nwithin the 24 hour cycle,\nit is very important that the\nfeeding window fall during the\nmore active phase of\none's day, so for humans,\nthat's typically in the early\npart of the day or the later\npart of the day,\nbut not at night, put very simply,\nthere are a lot of data now\npointing to the fact that eating\nduring the nocturnal phase\nof the 24 hour cycle is very\ndetrimental to one's health.\nIn fact,\nwhen we eat can either enhance\nour health or can diminish\nour health.\nWhen we see light can enhance\nour feelings of wellbeing or\ncan diminish our feelings of wellbeing.\nI've talked many times before about this,\non the human lab podcast,\nthat during the daytime,\nyou want to get as much sunlight\nand other types of bright\nlight in your eyes as safely possible.\nAnd then you want to avoid light\nin the middle of the night.\nIt has detrimental dopamine\nlowering effects can cause\ndepression, cortisol increases, et cetera.\nSo when you view light is as\nimportant as the light that you\nview.\nAnd when you eat is as important\nas what you eat, in this\nstudy, they saw something\nreally interesting,\nwhich was that not only did\nrestricting food to a particular\nphase of the 24 hour cycle benefit,\nthings like lean body mass\nand fat loss and a number of\nhealth parameters that we'll\ntalk about in a moment,\nbut it also anchored all the\ngene systems of the body and\nprovided a more regular stable\nso-called circadian rhythm or\n24 hour rhythm, you may be\nsurprised to learn that 80%,\n80% of the genes in your\nbody and brain are on a 24\nhour schedule.\nThat is they change their levels\ngoing from high to low and\nback to high again,\nacross the 24 hour cycle.\nAnd when those genes are high\nat the appropriate times and\nlow at the appropriate times,\nmeaning their expression is\nhigh and low at the appropriate\ntimes.\nAnd therefore the proper RNAs\nand proteins are made because\nDNA codes for RNA, RNA is\ntranslated into proteins.\nWhen that happens, your health benefits,\nwhen those genes are not\nexpressed at the right times when\nthey're higher or low at the\nwrong times of each 24 hour\ncycle, that's when you get\nnegative health effects.\nThis study showed that when\nmice restrict their eating to an\neight hour period within the\nmost active phase of their 24\nhour cycle,\nmany of the genes that are\nassociated with these so-called\ncircadian clocks, these genes\nhave names like PER, BMAL,\nCRY1, et cetera,\nthose so-called clock genes\nunderwent a very regular\nentrainment, a locking in to\nthe proper 24 hour schedule.\nAnd while this was in mice,\nwe now know that this\nalso occurs in humans,\nI've said before on this\npodcast, and I'll say it again,\nthat light,\nand when we view light is the\nprimary way in which these\ngenes and the clock systems\nof our body get organized or\nentrained, meaning matched to\nthe outside light dark cycle.\nSo viewing light early in\nthe day and in the afternoon,\nand as much as possible all day, great,\nideally that sunlight, avoiding\nlight in the middle of the\nnight is also great.\nIt's great because it causes\nthe increases in particular\ngenes and the decreases in\nparticular genes in every cell\nthroughout your body at\nthe appropriate times,\nthe second most powerful\ntimekeeper or zeitgeber, as it's\ncalled, is food, and when\nyou eat, and in this study,\nthe results they saw\nunderscore this point,\nwhat they saw is that the peaks\nin these clock genes became\nvery regular.\nAnd the dips in these clock\ngenes became very regular.\nAnd that led to a whole\nhost of really important,\npositive health effects.\nConversely, when mice ate,\nwhenever they wanted\nacross the 24 hour cycle,\nthese clock genes became\nreally out of whack and the\nnegative health consequences\nwere the downstream result of\nthese changes in these clock genes.\nThis is now also been shown\nto be true for humans.\nSo if you want to be healthy,\nyou want your organ health,\nyour metabolic health to\nbe in trained properly.\nOne of the most important\nthings you can do is to,\nif you lied at the appropriate\ntimes of each 24 hour\nschedule and to not view\nlight at other times of that\nschedule and to eat at the\nappropriate time of each 24 hour\nday.\nNow, again,\nthere are rare instances that\nwe will discuss when skipping\nentire days or entire 24\nhour cycles of eating can be\nbeneficial.\nBut for now we're talking\nabout schedules of time\nrestricted\nfeeding involve a window of\nfeeding that falls during\nyour more active phase,\nso during the daytime,\nputting aside people that work\nshift work during the daytime\nis when you want to eat.\nAnd this eight hour feeding\nwindow provided a very strong\nreinforcing signal that combines\nwith light to ensure that\nthese genes are expressed\nat the appropriate times.\nThe short takeaway from this\nis you probably want to think\nabout and perhaps even engage\nin time, restricted feeding.\nSo, as I mentioned earlier,\nwhen mice can eat around the\nclock, bad things happen.\nAnd one of the bad things\nthat happens is that the liver\nsuffers, the liver is involved\nin all sorts of things,\nproduction of important hormones\nand other factors related\nto metabolism.\nAnd when mice can eat around the clock,\ntheir livers got very sick,\nfatty deposits in the liver.\nOther factors in the liver\nessentially taken down the\npathway of liver disease,\nthe time restricted feeding,\nessentially reversed that or\nled in many cases to an even\nhealthier liver conditions,\nand that's based on this study,\nbut also additional\nstudies also now in humans.\nSo restricting your feeding\nto a particular window,\nevery 24 hour cycle has clearly\nbeen shown now in mice and\nin humans to enhance liver\nhealth, which is wonderful.\nHow does it do this, well, it\nhappens because food intake,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nsets certain conditions in the\nbody that lasts for a period\nof time.\nAnytime we eat,\nwhether or not we are a\nmouse or a human, there's\na period of time that's required\nfor so-called digestion,\nbut also gastric emptying and\nother processes related to\nbreaking down that food and utilizing it.\nAnd that is an active\nprocess. It requires energy.\nAnd that process of breaking\ndown food involves certain\ncellular functions that if\nthey're ongoing throughout the 24\nhour cycle or even extended\ntoo far across the 24 hour\ncycle, meaning you're eating\nacross a 14 or a 16 hour,\nan 18 hour window, that\ncauses serious problems.\nAnd this is now been established\nbecause of the fact that it\nincreases the expression of\ndifferent proteins and genes in\nthe body, as such as\nTNF alpha, IL-6, IL-1.\nwhat are all those things?\nThey are pro-inflammatory markers.\nSo the reason that the liver\ngets sick when you're eating\ntoo often is because inflammatory\nmarkers are increased.\nThese inflammatory markers\nare not inherently bad,\nthey're there for a reason,\nbut they are there in\norder to respond to certain\nchallenges, immune challenges,\nor the ingestion of food\nand the breakdown of food.\nBut then in an ideal circumstance,\nthey are reduced in the period\nin which there's no food\npresent in the digestive\ntract or in which there's very\nlittle food present in\nthe digestive tract.\nSo by eating around the clock,\nyou're making yourself sicker\nby eating at restricted\nperiods of time, each 24 hours a day,\nyou're actually making\nyourself healthier and you're\nactivating certain processes\nthat can positively impact both\nweight, either maintenance\nor loss of weight.\nWe'll talk about weight gain\na little later and positively\nimpacting things like liver health.\nAlso the expression of different\nthings related to brown\nfat, the fat that\nincreases your metabolism.\nWe will return to this also\na little bit later and blood\nglucose regulation, so the\ntakeaway from this study,\nin fact, there are many\ntakeaways from the study.\nIt's so wonderful is that liver health,\nbile acid metabolism, energy\nexpenditure inflammation,\nliver metabolites, many,\nmany aspects of our health\nare impacted by when we eat,\nnot just what we eat, as we move forward,\nand we talk about intermittent\nfasting for eight hour\nwindows, six hour windows,\n12 hour windows for all sorts\nof different intents and\npurposes.\nI want to start to establish\na foundational protocol that\nall of us,\nany of us can use in order\nto maximize your particular\ngoals.\nThere are some absolutes\nwithin this realm of\ntime-restricted feeding.\nHere are a couple of absolutes\nthat you would want to\nconsider, first of all,\nit pays off in the metabolic\nsense and in the health sense\nand in the weight maintenance\nor loss sense to not ingest\nany food in the first hour\nafter waking and potentially for\nlonger, so I want to repeat that.\nOne of the key pillars of\nintermittent fasting is that for\nthe first hour\nafter you wake up and potentially\nfor longer to not ingest\nany food, okay,\nthe second major pillar that's\nwell supported by research is\nthat for the two and ideally\nthree hours prior to bedtime,\nyou also don't ingest any food\nor liquid calories for that\nmatter.\nAnd we will talk about what\nit means to break a fast and\nwhether or not certain liquids,\neven coffee and tea can\nbreak a fast, et cetera,\nin a few moments, but\njust as a foundation,\nit's very clear from the research\nin humans that not eating\nany food or ingesting any\ncalories liquid or otherwise for\nthe first 60 minutes\nafter waking up each day.\nAnd for the two to three\nhours prior to your bedtime,\nthat's ideal for the\nparameters that we've discussed\nearlier,\nall the different things like\nweight and liver health and\nmetabolic health and so forth.\nThe two most common questions\nabout intermittent fasting are\nwhen is the ideal time\nfor the eating window?\nIs it early in the day,\nthe middle of the day or later in the day?\nAnd how long should that eating window be?\nShould it be eight hours?\nWe already heard why the\neight hour window was first\nestablished.\nIt was because of these lab\nconditions and the conditions of\nthe particular relationship\nof the graduate student\ninvolved,\nor should it be seven hours\nor six hours or 12 hours.\nIt turns out that there's some\ngeneral frameworks that we\ncan follow in order to\nanswer these questions.\nAs we move into this\nportion of the discussion,\nI want to highlight a very\nimportant reference that just\ncame out,\nliterally came out last week\nin the journal endocrinology\nreviews.\nAnd the title of this review\nis time-restricted eating for\nthe prevention and management\nof metabolic diseases.\nAlthough the data in this\npaper go well beyond metabolic\ndiseases, this is a paper\nfrom Satchin Panda's lab.\nIt's a very lengthy review\nwith an enormous table\nthat's beautifully organized\nthat scripts out all the\nstudies done in humans.\nWell over a hundred\nstudies looking at time,\nrestricted feeding in\nathletes, men, women, children,\ndiabetes, no diabetes, et cetera,\nwith detailed references and\ndescription of the outcomes.\nI've spent a lot of time with this review,\neven though it just came out\nrecently and is a absolute\ngoldmine resource.\nIt is also the major resource\nfor everything I'm about to\ntell you if you would like\nto delve deeper into the\nmaterial.\nSo let's deal with this first\nquestion of when is the ideal\nfeeding window, and here again,\nwe're thinking about a schedule\nof eating that involves\neating at least once every 24 hours,\nnot two day or three day\nor every other day fast.\nSo it turns out that the\nanswer to the question,\nwhen is it best to eat is\nactually best answered by thinking\nabout the other side of the coin,\nwhich is when is it best to fast?\nSo, because we are fasting during sleep,\nit's very clear that it's best\nto extend the sleep-related\nfast either into the morning\nor to start it in the evening.\nNow this might seem kind of obvious,\nbut it's actually not so obvious.\nYou could place that feeding\nwindow early in the day,\nmiddle of the day or late in the day.\nLet's think about what happens\nwhen we sleep, when we sleep,\nour body undergoes a number\nof different processes in the\nbrain and body in order to\nrecover the cells and tissues.\nMany of you have probably\nheard of autophagic,\nwhich is essentially a cleaning\nup a gobbling up of dead\ncells and cells that are injured or sick.\nAnd this is a natural process that occurs,\nand it occurs mainly during sleep.\nAlthough not only during sleep,\nfasting of any kind does tend\nto enhance autophagy.\nIt is not the only way to\ncreate autophagic conditions.\nAutophagic conditions can be\ncreated simply by following a\nsub caloric diet.\nAnd there are other things\nthat one can do in order to\ntrigger autophagy, but fasting\ndoes trigger autophagy.\nSo when we're asleep,\nthe bad cells are getting\ngobbled up and eaten.\nAnd the good cells also are\nundergoing certain repair\nmechanisms mainly related to,\nor at least governed by those\ncircadian genes that we talked\nabout earlier, those clock genes.\nSo you're already fasting when\nyou're asleep and how deep\nyou are into that fast depends\non how long it was since your\nlast meal.\nSo if you fast early in the day,\nand you've been asleep\nfor 5, 6, 7, 8 hours,\nI would hope somewhere between\nsix and eight hours for most\npeople is going to be beneficial.\nWhen you wake up,\nI mentioned earlier that you\ndon't want to eat for at least\nthe first 60 minutes after waking,\nbut were you to extend\nthat fasting to say,\n9:00 AM 10:00 AM,\n11:00 AM or even 12 noon or\nlater you are taking advantage\nof the deep, fast that\nyou were in during sleep.\nAnd certainly toward\nthe end of sleep, now,\nwhy do I say deep, fast?\nWell,\nbecause when we eat the clearance\nof that food from our gut\nand the processes in our cells\nand organs that are related\nto digestion,\nand the utilization of that\nfood takes about five to six\nhours, so if you eat a meal\nand that meal lasts 10 minutes,\n20 minutes or 30 minutes, or even an hour,\nand then you stop eating,\nyou've stopped eating,\nbut you are not fasting at that point.\nYou can say you're fasting\nbecause you're no longer putting\nfood into your digestive tract,\nbut you're not in a fasted state.\nYou are not under conditions\nof fasting, later,\nI'll talk about things that\nyou can do to accelerate the\ntransition into fasting.\nSo one thing is certain, that\nyou want your eating window to\nbe tacked or attached to your\nsleep based fasting in a way\nthat makes it easier for you\nto get into the fasted state\nfor a period of time.\nSo we can view that point\nfrom the perspective of best,\nbetter and worst, okay?\nSo if you are like most\npeople and you sleep at night,\nyou're waking up somewhere\naround 6:30, 7:00 AM,\nor maybe even 8:00 AM.\nLet's say you were to push\nyour fasting window out,\nsuch that you started eating at noon,\nand then you stopped eating at 6:00 PM.\nWell,\nthen you're not eating from\n6:00 PM until let's say your\nbedtime is 10:00 PM, but\nfrom 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM,\nyour body is not yet in a fasted\nstate because you just ate.\nHowever,\nyou're starting to taper into\na fastest state before sleep\nand then all through sleep.\nAnd until the next\nmorning and late morning,\nyou are actually in a fasted state, now,\nmost people find it very hard\nto only eat in the middle of\nthe day, so while that's best,\nit's ideal for sake of the fasting\nrelated improvements in health,\nit is not ideal.\nAnd it's not very applicable\nto most work and family and\nsocial situations.\nMost people eat breakfast with others and,\nor eat dinner with others.\nSome people eat lunch with\nothers, but in general,\nit's hard to restrict your\nfeeding window to just the\nabsolute middle of the day,\nbut from a purely health perspective,\nin a very objective way, that\nwould be the ideal situation.\nLet's imagine a different\npattern of eating where the\nfeeding window starts in the\nafternoon starts around two or\neven 3:00 PM.\nSome people don't have much\ntrouble or they can train\nthemselves to get their\nfeeding window out to two or\n3:00 PM, and then they won't\neat until 10 or 11:00 PM.\nRight, if you do the math,\nyou realize that that feeding\nwindow is still pretty short.\nIt still constitutes what we\nwould call intermittent fasting\nor time restricted feeding.\nBut assuming that they go\nto bed around 11:00 PM or\nmidnight,\nthey are not actually fasted\nin sleep because for the first\nsix hours or so of sleep, maybe five,\nbut probably more like six hours of sleep,\nthey're still digesting the\nfood that they consumed a late\nin the night.\nIt does appear beneficial\nto grab a hold of that\nsleep-related fast,\nmeaning you don't want your\nfeeding window to be too close\nto bedtime.\nAnd that's why we came up\nwith this kind of foundational\npillar that I discussed\nwith such an earlier,\nwhich is at least no eating for\nthe first hour after waking,\nbut also no eating within two\nto three hours prior to bed.\nAnd because we all need to\nsleep and sleep is seemingly\nimportant for our health of all kinds.\nYou want to prioritize sleep,\nbut because we also have to eat,\nthen you start to think about\nthis and maybe it's not so\ngood to push that feeding\nwindow too late in the day,\nbecause when you go to sleep,\nyou're not actually capitalizing\non the sleep related\nfasting.\nNow it's not just the case\nthat it's easiest to fast while\nin sleep, although that's true\nbecause when we're asleep,\ntypically we're not hungry or\nlooking for food or foraging\nfor food or wanting food\nor trying to resist food.\nWe're just sleeping.\nThere is something special\nabout the fasting that occurs\nduring sleep,\nbecause it's associated with\na number of processes that\nrelate to the so-called lymphatic system,\nthe movement of lymph like\nfluids and other fluids through\nthe brain, and kind of sweeping\nout a garbage disposal,\nif you will,\na clearing out of the metabolic\ndebris and some of the\nautophagy that's associated\nwith bad processes in the brain.\nSo we could do a whole episode on this,\nbut essentially during\nsleep, and in particular,\nduring fasted states of sleep,\nwe are undergoing a number\nof automatic seller processes\nthat clear out debris from\nour brain enhance cognition,\nor at least offset dementia.\nThis is now well-established\nas well as a number of the same\nprocesses occurring in\nthe organs of our body.\nSo what we're starting to\nsee here is that there are a\nnumber of constraints on\nwhen you can eat, now,\nI would be remiss if I\ndidn't acknowledge the social\nconstraints and the real\nlife constraints, some of us,\nbecause we want to eat with\nour family and because our\nfamily or our significant\nothers eat around eight or\n9:00 PM, and that's the\nonly time we're together,\nYou have to eat late in the day.\nAnd that certainly not a sin.\nI'm not saying that's good or bad, here\nwe're trying to establish\nif you recall, best, better,\nand worst.\nSo from both a practical and\na health perspective and a\npurely objective view of how\nintermittent fasting works and\ncan benefit us, starting to eat each day,\nsomewhere around 10:00 AM or around noon,\nand then allowing a feeding\nwindow that goes until six or\nmaybe 8:00 PM.\nThat seems to me,\nat least based on the data\nand what I understand about\ntypical cultures,\nwhere people eat in the\ndaytime and in the evening,\nthat seems to me like the kind\nof schedule that will allow\nyou to get the most out\nof intermittent fasting,\ntime-restricted feeding,\nbut does not set you up to be\nreally out of sync with the\nsocial rhythms in most cultures.\nIf you think about it from the\nperspective of say a noon to\neight feeding window,\nwhat you'll find is that\nyou're able to eat lunch with\nothers.\nIf you like, or by yourself,\nyou will be able to eat\ndinner at a reasonable hour,\nat least in most countries,\nin most cultures,\neating dinner somewhere\nbetween 6:30 and 7:00 PM is\ntypical.\nWhen you say a feeding\nwindow, that goes until eight.\nThat doesn't mean sitting\ndown to dinner at eight.\nThat means your last bite of\nfood or ingestion of any liquid\ncalories was at 8:00 PM.\nAssuming that you go to bed\nsomewhere between 10:00 PM and\n1:00 AM that allows this tapering off,\nor this transition from\nfeeding to a fasted state,\nand still allows you to capitalize\non the special period of\nfasting that is sleep-related fasting.\nAnd again,\nI want to emphasize that the\nfasting that occurs during\nsleep is vital and eating too\nclose to sleep will disrupt\nthat fasting related sleep.\nNow,\nthere are a number of caveats\nand details related to this,\nand there's an important caveat\nin detail related to people\nthat are specifically\ninterested in increasing or\nmaintaining muscle mass.\nSo first let's talk about food\nvolume and food type and how\nthat relates to whether or not\nyou quickly or slowly enter a\nfasted state.\nBecause clearly when we\ntalk about a feeding window,\nthat feeding window could\ninclude any number of different\nfoods, it could involve\ncake and ice cream, pizza,\nhamburgers, plants, fruit, whatever it is,\nor it could involve just fats\nor just proteins, et cetera.\nThere are at least three\nfactors that are going to govern\nhow quickly you transition\nfrom ingesting food to a fasted\nstate, remember,\nas you ingest your last\nbite or sip of calories,\nthat's not when the fast begins.\nThat might be when the fastening\nbegins on your watch or on\none of these apps that\nI'll refer to later,\nwhich can help you track your\nfasting and eating windows.\nBut that's not when it actually\nbegins because your body is\nstill seeing food.\nYou're actually carrying\naround food inside of you,\neven though you're not\nputting into your mouth,\nyou're still eating in some sense.\nSo it should be somewhat obvious\nthat very large meals are\ngoing to take longer to\ndigest than very small meals.\nSo that will impact how slowly\nor quickly you migrate from a\nfed state to a fasted state.\nThere's no way I can spell out\nwhat exact volume of food you\nshould ingest based on the\nsize of your stomach and et\ncetera, but you're all familiar\nwith being extremely full,\nvery full, comfortably\nfull, somewhat full,\nor not feeling full and feeling hungry.\nSo learning to gauge\nfood volume is important.\nAlso foods that include some\nfats or a lot of fats will tend\nto slow gastric emptying time.\nAnd depending on the kind of fats,\nit could mean that a given\nmeal is digested within three\nhours versus five hours.\nAnd more fats might be a large\nmeal with a lot of fats has\nbeen, can take five or six hours.\nA smaller meal with less fat\nis going to be digested more\nquickly consuming calories in\nliquid form is going to mean\nthat gastric emptying time\nis going to be faster.\nAnd then of course,\nthere's the glucose and\nthe insulin aspect to it,\nwhich is that foods that lead\nto big steep rises in glucose\nlike pure sugars.\nThen your glucose will drop, however,\nif they're combined with fats,\nthen it tends to be a more\ngradual rise in glucose and it's\nmore sustained, et cetera.\nFibrous foods will also create\na more long lasting sustained\nrelease in glucose.\nThe important thing here is\nto establish a feeding window\nthat you can comfortably manage, okay?\nMeaning that on average,\nyou can obey a six hour\nfeeding window or an eight hour\nfeeding window or a 10\nhour feeding window.\nAnd then to place that feeding\nwindow in a social and life\ncontext that you can manage\non a regular basis, now,\nthere are two key points that\nhave been gleaned from the\nscientific data about this\nfeeding window and when to place\nit.\nAnd this is based on a\nreally important experiment\nthat Satchin and his\ncolleagues have been doing.\nThere's a website that they\nhave zero-cost website called My\nCircadian Clock, you can go\nto this website free of cost.\nThere are a number of\nimportant resources there,\nbut what they've done is\nthey've examined the feeding\nbehavior of thousands of people.\nPeople will take a picture of\nthe food they're about to eat,\nand it enters into their\naccount, maybe your account,\nif you create one on My\nCircadian Clock, and they do this\nover many days or weeks,\nwhat's great about this is it establishes\nwhat's essentially called a\nfetal gram a time in which\npeople ate.\nAnd a number of important\nfindings have emerged from these\nfetal grams, across large\npopulations of people,\ndifferent time zones with\ndifferent schedules, et cetera.\nFirst of all,\nalmost everybody underestimates\ntheir feeding window.\nMeaning people who think that\nthey are on an eight hour\nfeeding window or six hour\nfeeding window, when their data\nare analyzed,\nit almost is always the case\nthat they're actually on a\nfeeding window\nthat's one or even two hours\nlonger than they think you\nthink, well,\nhow could that possibly be if\npeople are taking their first\nbite at noon and they're taking\ntheir last bite at 8:00 PM?\nWell,\nthat must mean that they are\non that feeding window of eight\nhours.\nAnd it turns out that people cheat,\nbut they don't cheat in\nany kind of obvious way.\nThey might have, you know, a\nglass of wine after dinner,\nor they'll have a cup of tea\nand a little bite of a cookie.\nAnd so when people are\nhonest and they are honest,\nin most cases for this experiment,\nwhat you find is that most\npeople's eating window is\nactually quite a bit longer.\nSo in discussing this with\nsuch in and reviewing the\nliterature,\nit's clear that if you'd like\nto be on a 10 hour feeding\nwindow,\nthat you should probably\nselect an eight hour feeding\nwindow,\nbecause there's always a\nlittle bit of a taper on either\nside of that eating window.\nVery few people are extremely\nstrict about these eating\nwindows.\nIt's just hard to do in the\ncontext of life events and\nsocial gatherings and,\nand family and so forth.\nOkay, so as we build forward,\nyour ideal fasting slash\ntime-restricted feeding schedule,\nwe now have several different\nrules that we can list out\nfirst,\nat least no food for the first\nhour after waking up at least\none hour, two, no food intake\nfor two and ideally three hours\nprior to your bedtime.\nThree, if you want to select\nan eight hour feeding window,\nthen you should probably\nfocus on a six or seven hour\nfeeding window because in reality,\nyour feeding window is\ngoing to be longer reality,\nmeaning real life constraints.\nAnd if you'd like to be on\na 10 hour feeding window,\nyou should probably select an\neight or a nine hour feeding\nwindow,\nbecause the way it plays out\nis that people almost always\neat outside of their\neating window, somewhat.\nThe other nice thing about\nselecting a slightly shorter\neating window than is comfortable\nfor you is that it takes\ninto account that as you take\nyour last bite or your last\nsip of calories, there's\nthis time or taper before,\nwhich you are actually in a fasted state.\nAnd because you're eating\ndifferent things on different\ndays, presumably some foods\nleave your gut more quickly.\nSome things spike your insulin\nand your glucose more than\nothers.\nSometimes you eat more\nfat, sometimes less fat.\nThis allows you to fall well\nwithin the margins of the\nbenefits of time-restricted\nfeeding that had been\ndemonstrated in humans,\nwhich generally involve an\neight hour window or so.\nSo I think this eight hour\nwindow or six hour window is a\ngood thing to shoot for\nmost people, some people,\nand we will discuss the exceptions,\nbut some people truly\nare exceptions to this.\nThey just require more food.\nAnd along those lines,\nI just now briefly want to touch\non some of the studies that\nhave looked at using a very\nshort feeding window of about\nfour hours, nowadays,\na number of people are doing\nthe so-called one meal per day,\nor are restricting their feeding\nwindow to just four hours\nor six hours.\nAnd that turns out to be an\ninteresting strategy and the\ndata around it actually are\na little bit surprising.\nOne surprising thing to leap\nout of this massive literature\nreview on time\nrestricted feeding in humans\nis that relatively short\nfeeding windows of say four to\nsix hours do produce a number\nof positive health effects.\nThings like increased insulin sensitivity,\nwhich we know is good, remember type two\ndiabetes is a reduction in\ninsulin sensitivity improvements\nin beta cell function and\nthe pancreas decreased blood\npressure,\ndecreased oxidative stress\ndecreases in things like evening\nappetite.\nSo positive health effects\nand psychological facts in\ngeneral.\nHowever, they either produce\nno change in body weight,\nor they tend to produce even\nincreases in body weight, now,\nof course there's variation\nbetween individuals and between\nstudies, but this is somewhat surprising.\nSo the eight hour feeding window\nseems to be very beneficial\nacross almost all the\nparameters that we've discussed,\ninflammation, weight,\nloss, fat loss, et cetera,\nand adherence.\nI should mention people's ability\nto stick to the diet seems\nquite good on this eight\nhour feeding windows,\nbut when people try and undergo\nvery short feeding windows\nof four to six hours,\nit seems that they are overeating\nin that four to six hours,\nat least overeating with respect\nto their metabolic needs.\nNow,\nthe contrast to this is the\nso-called a one meal per day\nschedule, very few studies\non one meal per day,\none meal per day, unless\nit's a very, very long meal,\na sort of feast typically would\nnot last four to six hours\nbecause it sort of depends\non how you define a meal.\nBut when you look at the\nvery few, I should emphasize,\nagain, very few studies\non one meal per day.\nPeople typically maintain or\nlose weight on the one meal per\nday schedule.\nSo what we can say is that\nthe seven to nine hour feeding\nwindow produces all of the\nmajor health benefits of\ntime-restricted feeding\nas well as being pretty\nstraightforward for most people\nto adhere to on a regular\nbasis and on a regular basis,\nturns out to be very important.\nI'll get back to that point in a moment.\nWhereas the four to six hour\neating window doesn't seem to\nserve people as well as say\na seven or eight hour eating\nwindow,\nsimply because people are\novereating during that eating\nwindow and the one meal per day,\nwhile perhaps ideal for\ncertain people's schedules may\nactually cause people to under-eat.\nAnd in some cases that\nmight be what people want.\nThey actually want to under-eat.\nBut when we start thinking\nabout in work and in sport,\nand when we start considering\nhormone health and hormone\nproduction, fertility,\nthat's when we can really start\nto look at the seven to nine\nhour feeding window versus\nthe four to six hour feeding\nwindow versus the one meal per\nday type feeding window with\nsome different objectivity,\nwe can start to look at it\nthrough a different lens because\nit turns out that when you\nplace the feeding window and how\nlong that feeding window is\nactually will impact a number of\nother things in particular hormones,\nthat can be very important for\na number of things related to\nsex and reproduction can be\nrelated to performance at work\nperformance in athleticism.\nAnd there are excellent studies on this.\nSo let's explore those now.\nSo let's talk about some\nconditions where having the feeding\nwindow early in the day would\nactually be very beneficial.\nThere was a study that was\npublished recently in Cell\nReports, again, Cell Press Journal,\nexcellent journal peer\nreviewed, very stringent,\nfrom Aoyama, et al,\nso this is AOYAMA, et al.\nThis was published just recently\nin July, 2021 that looked\nat the distribution of protein\nintake in different meals\ndelivered either early in\nthe day or later in the day.\nAnd I'm summarizing here quite a lot,\nbut I should mention that this\nstudy was performed in both\nmice and humans, same paper,\nmice and humans and involved\nhypertrophy training,\nessentially increasing the\nweight bearing of given limbs to\ntry and induce hypertrophy,\nwhich is the growth of muscle tissue.\nIt does appear that muscle\ntissue is better able to undergo\nhypertrophy by virtue of the\nfact that there's better or\nenhanced protein synthesis\nearly in the day,\nbecause of the expression of\none of these particular clock\ngenes called BMAL, BMAL,\nBMAL regulates a number of\ndifferent protein synthesis\npathways within muscle cells,\nsuch that eating protein early in the day,\nsupports muscle tissue\nmaintenance and or growth.\nAnd in this study,\nthey also looked at the effects\nof supplementing so-called\nBCAs branch chain amino acids,\nwhich is popular in bodybuilding\ncircles and in strength\ntraining circles and BCAs\nare essential components of a\nnumber of different foods,\nbut can also be supplemented.\nThe takeaway of this study\nis pretty straight forward.\nHowever,\nthe takeaway is if your main\ninterest is maintaining and,\nor building muscle,\nthen it can be beneficial to\ningest protein early in the\nday, you would still want to obey this,\nwhat we're calling a kind\nof foundational rule of no,\nnot eating any food for the\nfirst hour post waking or at\nleast the first hour post.\nAnd the cutoff for when you\nwould want to eat protein would\nbe sometime before 10:00 AM.\nAnd there I'm averaging\nacross a number of different\nsituations, but in general,\nthis BMAL expression is such\nthat let's say you wake up at\n7:00 AM.\nYour main interest is in\nhypertrophy or maintenance of\nmuscle.\nThen you would want to ingest\nsome protein sometime before\n10:00 AM.\nBut obviously if you're\ninterested in getting the health\neffects of intermittent fasting,\nthat you wouldn't ingest any\nfood for at least the first 60\nminutes upon waking.\nNow it's not as if at 10:01\nAM a gate slam shut and you\ncan't generate hypertrophy,\nof course that's not the case.\nHowever,\nit's very interesting that\nit doesn't matter when the\nresistance training,\nthe load bearing exercise\noccurs in the 24 hour cycle.\nSo whether or not in other words,\npeople are training early in\nthe day or they're training\nlate in the day.\nIt still appears that ingesting\nprotein early in the day\nfavors hypertrophy or that one is better,\nor I should say more easily\nable to access hypertrophy by\nway of these clock,\nregulated protein synthesis\nmechanisms by ingesting protein\nearly in the day, in no way, shape or form\ndoes this study say that\ningesting protein later in the day\nis somehow bad for you?\nIt just emphasizes the positive\neffects of ingesting protein\nearly in the day for sake\nof muscle maintenance and or\nhypertrophy.\nSo if you're somebody who is\nmainly concerned with muscle\nmaintenance and hypertrophy,\nthen it may make sense to move\nthat feeding window earlier\nin the day.\nAnd certainly there are people\nout there who are interested\nin muscle maintenance and hypertrophy,\nwho aren't doing\nintermittent fasting at all,\nand that's also perfectly fine,\nbut this just so happens to be\nan episode about intermittent\nfasting and time restricted feeding.\nThere are of course,\nmodes of eating where one eats\nsmall meals spread throughout\nthe day or weights meals differently.\nSuch that meals early in the\nday are larger than later in\nthe day or vice versa.\nThere are a near infinite\nnumber of ways to organize this.\nBut if you are somebody who\nis interested in deriving,\nthe many clearly established\nhealth effects of\ntime-restricted feeding,\nand you are somebody who would\nlike to maintain or build\nmuscle,\nthen ingesting proteins in the\nearly part of the day would\nbe important to you at least\non the basis of these results.\nAnd therefore that eight\nhour window that we've\nestablished as more or less\nideal shifted to the later part\nof the day might not be\nas beneficial for you.\nNow I can just personally say that for me.\nWhen I wake up in the morning,\nit's very easy for me to\nnot eat until noon or one or\n2:00 PM.\nEating early in the day is\nactually somewhat of a challenge.\nI discuss this point with Satchin,\nbecause we were talking about\nhow is it that one can move\ntheir feeding window or place\nthemselves onto a different\nschedule of intermittent fasting.\nAnd it's very clear that one\nneeds to provide a transition\nperiod in order for that to happen,\nyou should allow yourself a\ntransition period of anywhere\nfrom one week to 10 days in\nwhich you shift your feeding\nwindow by about an hour each day or so.\nAnd then once you establish\na feeding window that feels\ncomfortable for you and that\nyou think you can maintain over\ntime,\nthat you simply maintain that\nfeeding schedule for at least\n30 days, but ideally you\nwould do that indefinitely.\nNow this turns out to be\nimportant based on data that\nthey've gleaned from\nthis My Circadian Clock\nmassive experiment that\nthey've been doing,\nwhere people are entering the\ntimes that they're feeding\nand, and eating.\nExcuse me, anytime we talk about mice,\nI always think about feeding\nbecause I come from a background\nin my lab, works on both\nlaboratory mice and on humans.\nAnd anytime I think about\nhumans, I think about eating,\nbut of course they are the same thing.\nThe interesting thing to emerge\nfrom that very large data\nset in humans is that when\npeople log their feeding times,\nas I mentioned before,\noftentimes they think they're\neating in an eight hour\nwindow,\nbut they are actually eating\nin a much broader window.\nHowever,\neven for people that are very\ngood about restricting their\nfeeding to a four, six\nor eight hour window,\nif they're very strict about\nthe start and stop times,\nand when they ingest calories,\none of the findings that's\nreally been important to note is\nthat almost every individual\nhas a lot of drift in when that\neating window resides\nin their 24 hour period.\nIn particular on the weekends,\npeople are either extending or\nshifting their feeding window\nin a way that makes it seem\nthat they've traveled to another\ntime zone and are eating\naccording to another time zone.\nAnd this is extremely important.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nbased on the 2012 study\nfrom Satchin's lab,\nwhere eating at a particular\nphase of each 24 hour cycle can\nhelp enhance the expression\nof these clock genes.\nIf you are eating within a\nvery strict or semi strict\nfeeding window,\nbut that feeding window is\nmigrating around from day to day\nor five days a week.\nYou're really organized\nabout when that falls,\nlet's say for sake of\nexample, from noon to 8:00 PM,\nnoon to 8:00 PM, Monday\nNoonday PM, Tuesday, Wednesday,\nnoon to 8:00 PM, Thursday and so forth.\nBut then on the Saturday,\nit's becoming 11:00 AM and\nyou're ending it early,\nor perhaps your starting\nearly in the day on Sunday,\nyou're having brunch that\nstarts at nine 30 or 10,\nand then it's extending\nout still just eight hours.\nBut it shifting around that\ncan cause disruptions in the\ncircadian clock mechanisms\nthat cause disruptions in the\ndownstream effects of eating\nthat are taking at least two to\nthree days to recover from.\nSo obviously we don't want to\nbe overly neurotic about this\nstuff, but because this is an\nepisode about the science of\nintermittent fasting and\ntime restricted feeding, as\nimportant as how long\nyour feeding window is,\nis where that feeding window\nresides in each 24 hour cycle.\nAnd perhaps even more important\nthan that is that it be\nfairly regular where that\nfeeding window resides.\nBecause even if you have a\nvery short feeding window,\nif it's drifting around from day to day,\nthat actually offsets a\nnumber of the positive health\neffects of intermittent fasting.\nSo to really just underscore\nthe way that these different\npieces of the biological\npuzzle fit together,\nif you are very strict or semi\nstrict about your eight hour\nfeeding window,\nbut on the weekends that\neight hour feeding window is\nfalling later than it normally\nwould during the middle of\nthe week.\nIt is as if you are going to bed later,\neven if you're going to\nbed at the same time,\nat least from the perspective\nof metabolic health,\nbecause of the way that eating\nimpacts these clock genes and\nimpacts, or I should say subtracts,\nthe sleep-related fasting that\nyou would normally experience\nif you were to finish eating\nthat a couple hours before\nbedtime, so again,\nwe don't want to create any\noverly obsessive or neurotic\nfocus on this, I think that most,\nall people could benefit from\na time-restricted feeding\nschedule,\nbut they should really think\nhard about what they can stick\nto on a regular basis and\nunderstand that they tend to\nunderestimate the feeding window,\nthat they actually are partaking in,\nand that they should place that\nfeeding window in a portion\nof the 24 hour cycle that\nthey can be consistent on most\ndays, and I want to emphasize most again,\nbecause we are not laboratory mice.\nWe don't have a graduate student\ncoming in for eight hours a\nday because that's what their\nsignificant other will allow\nthem to do.\nAnd then removing the food\nfrom our jowls and from our\ncages, we have access to food\npretty much, 24 hours a day,\nalong those lines, however,\nthere are things that we can\nall do that will allow us to\noffset some of the drift if you will,\nthat we experience or that we\ninduce in terms of when our\nfeeding window occurs or that\nthe feeding window might push\nout a little later and then\ntherefore start a little later,\nthe next day, there are things\nthat we can do in there,\nthings that we can take.\nAnd so I'd like to discuss those briefly.\nSo throughout this episode,\nI've more or less been alluding\nto the fact that when you\neat, there's some period of\ntime afterwards in which you're\nactually still eating,\nat least from the\nperspective of metabolism,\nbecause glucose is up,\ninsulin is up and you're\nundergoing different metabolic and\ndigestive processes that don't\nreally speak to you being in\na fasted state, right?\nIt's not just about when you\ntake your last bite or your\nlast sip.\nHowever,\nthere are things that we can\ndo to accelerate the transition\nfrom a fed state to a fasted state.\nAnd so I'd like to discuss what those are.\nAnd I want to emphasize that\nthe term fed state is probably\na better way to think about\nit than eating or not eating\nbecause we think of eating\nthe verb, we're eating,\nwe're eating, okay, we're\ndone eating I'm fasting now,\nbut you're not actually fasting\nyou because you are fed.\nSo we should really think about\nfed and unfed states because\nfrom a seller processes\nperspective and from a health\nperspective,\nthat's actually what your body\nand your system are paying\nattention to.\nAnd by now with everything\nthat we've laid out,\nI think that should be\nintuitive to understand.\nSo there's a fun and exciting\nconcept related to this,\nwhich is glucose clearing.\nYou may have heard the old adage\nthat if you take a 20 or 30\nminute walk after dinner,\nthat it accelerates the rate\nat which you digest that food.\nAnd indeed it does, clearing\nout of glucose from your system\ncan be accomplished through\na number of different means,\nbut light movement or\nexercise does increase gastric\nemptying time, so for instance,\nif you were to eat a meal\nthat ended at 8:00 PM,\nand then plop to the couch, watch TV,\nor get on your computer or go to sleep,\nit would be five or six hours\nuntil you have transitioned\nfrom a fed state to a fasted state.\nHowever,\nyou can accelerate that\nconsiderably by taking a 20 or 30\nminute just light walk, it\ndoesn't have to be speed walking.\nIt certainly doesn't have to be jogging,\nbut just walking outside or moving around.\nSo glucose clearing is an\nimportant aspect of the transition\nfrom the fed state to the fasted state.\nAnd just a light walk can\nallow you to do that, now,\nif you can't get outside,\nsome people will go\nthrough the gymnastics,\nliterally of doing things like\nair squats and pushups and\nthings like that, and indeed,\nthose will increase the expression\nof things like glut four\nand things that mobilize glucose\ninto muscles and things of\nthat sort, but, you know,\nunder most conditions,\nmost people aren't doing\npush-ups after dinner,\nor certainly who've had a big meal,\njust taking a light\nwalk can be beneficial.\nIn addition, you could consider\ndoing intense exercise.\nNow you wouldn't necessarily\nwant to do that immediately\nafter eating.\nSo let's take a look at what\nhigh-intensity training of any\nkind does to blood glucose,\nbecause in this case,\nit turns out that when you\ndo high intensity training\nactually has opposite\neffects on blood glucose,\ndepending on whether or not\nyou do it early or later in the\nday.\nSo a fairly recent study looked\nat so-called hit training,\nhigh intensity interval training,\nwhich of course can take\nmany different forms.\nIt can take the form of\ncircuit training with weights.\nIt can take the form of, you know,\nburpees and pushups and sprints\nand all sorts of different\nthings.\nBut high intensity interval\ntraining is typically training\nthat gets people's heart\nrates up, you know,\nwell above 70% of maximum and\nthen brief periods of rest and\nthen repeating and how long\nthe high intensity interval\ntraining of course will also vary.\nThere's there are a very brief, you know,\nsix or 12 or 15 minute workouts.\nSome people can carry on\nwith high intensity interval\ntraining for up to 45\nor maybe even 60 minutes\nin extreme cases.\nBut when you look at the\nstudies that have explored high\nintensity interval training and\nits effect on blood glucose,\nthere are a couple of studies\nthat leap out, for instance,\none that emphasized that blood\nglucose levels will actually\nincrease if high intensity\ninterval training is performed\nearly in the day and will\ndecrease if high intensity\ninterval training is\nperformed later in the day.\nNow the purpose for this\nexploration was not to explore\nclearance of blood glucose for\nsake of intermittent fasting.\nIt was mainly focused on athletic\nperformance and whether or\nnot that was better early in\nthe day or later in the day,\net cetera.\nBut we can extract some\ninformation from these studies that\nare beneficial for sake of\nunderstanding glucose clearing.\nIf you have ingested food\nthroughout the afternoon and\nevening and late in the day,\nand you're thinking about going\nto sleep and you'd like to\nenter sleep in a way that\nis less fed and more fasted,\nthen engaging in high-intensity\ninterval training in the\nafternoon will lower or\nevening I should say,\nwill lower blood glucose.\nAnd in that way will help you\naccelerate your transition\ninto the fastest state provided\nyou don't ingest something\nafter the high intensity\ninterval training.\nNow is the increase in blood\nglucose that occurs from high\nintensity interval\ntraining early in the day,\nis that detrimental, not necessarily.\nSo that oftentimes is\nassociated with the shuttling of\nnutrients to the muscles.\nThey've just done a lot of hard work.\nSo it's not that high intensity\ninterval training should not\nbe done early in the day,\nin fact, for many people,\nincluding myself training\nearly in the day,\njust for the way that my\npsychology and biology works is\nalways better for me than\ntraining later in the day.\nAnd the other important\nthing to mention is that high\nintensity interval training\ndone late in the day can be\nbeneficial from the perspective\nof glucose clearing,\nlowering blood glucose,\nand helping transition from\nthe fed to the fasted state in\npreparation for sleep.\nHowever,\nif you're ingesting caffeine\nor anything to engage in that\nhigh intensity interval training\nin a way that prevents you\nfrom getting to sleep well,\nthen it's going to be detrimental overall.\nSo the reason I mentioned\nthis is of course,\nbecause it's nice to know that\nlight walks after dinner or\nany other meal for that matter\nor high intensity interval\ntraining provided it's done\nin the second half of the day\ncan lower blood glucose and\nspeed the transition from fed to\nfasted states.\nBut I also mentioned it because\nwhat we are really trying to\nachieve when we partake in\nintermittent fasting so-called\ntime-restricted feeding is what\nwe're really trying to do is\naccess unfed states or fasted states.\nIt's not really about when\nyou eat and what you do.\nIt's about extending the\nduration of the fasting period\nas long as you can,\nin a way that's still compatible\nwith your eating, right,\nnot the other way around.\nAnd this gets back to this\nkey feature of our biology,\nwhich is that what we eat\nwhen we eat, when we exercise,\nwhen we view light,\nit's about setting a context\nor a set of conditions in your\nbrain and body.\nSo it's not so much about the\nactivities that you undergo.\nIt's about the activities you\nundergo and their relationship\nto one another over\ntime, and so in this way,\nit really beautifully highlights\nthe way that your biology\nis interacting all the\ntime light is setting.\nWhen you're going to be awakened,\nwhen you're going to be asleep,\nwhen you eat is going to be\ndetermining when you're going to\nbe awakened, when you're\ngoing to be asleep.\nAnd when you eat is also going\nto be determining when you\nare able to clear out debris\nfrom your brain and body and\nrepair the various cells\nand mechanisms of your body,\nwhen you're able to reduce\nthose inflammatory cytokines\nthroughout your body.\nAnd this is really the beauty\nof time research and feeding,\nwhich is, it's not really\nabout restricting your feeding.\nIt's about accessing the beauty\nof the fasted state, now,\nthere are other ways to clear\nout blood glucose that involve\nsupplements or prescription drugs.\nThese are so-called glucose\ndisposal agents, glucose,\ndisposal agents, such as Metformin,\nwhich is a prescription drug or berberine,\nwhich is an over the counter\nsubstance will lead to very\ndramatic reductions in blood glucose.\nAnd so they shift you from\na fed to a fasted state.\nAnd I know many people who\ntake berberine before eating\nmeals that include a large\nnumber of carbohydrates,\nfor instance, as a way\nto clear out glucose.\nNow I've tried berberine before.\nAnd what I can tell you is\nthat if you take berberine,\nwhich by the way is very\nmuch like Metformin,\nits effects are almost\nidentical to Metformin in fact,\nbut it's much less expensive\nand it's over the counter.\nIf you take berberine\nand you have not ingested\ncarbohydrates, many\npeople, including myself,\nexperience a splitting headache,\nyou become hypoglycemic because\nit is a glucose clearing\nagent.\nSo if you're going to experiment\nwith things like Metformin\nand or berberine or similar,\nyou want to be very cautious\nthat you're not clearing out\nblood glucose, that's already low.\nAnd the dose response for this\nvaries tremendously from one\nindividual to the next.\nAnd there's a strong circadian component.\nSo if some people react very\nwell to berberine early in the\nday, but find that later in the day,\nit provides extreme headaches\nfor some people it's the\nopposite.\nSo I caution you in exploring\nthings like berberine and\nMetformin that you should\nexpect to experience a number of\nphysical and psychological\neffects that may work for you\nmight be great for you,\nbut might also not be\ngreat for you, nowadays,\nthere are a number of\ncommercially available,\ncontinuous glucose monitors, I've tried\none of these, it involves putting\nwhat's essentially a patch\nwith a little needle\nthat goes into your skin,\nwhich is continuing\ncontinually, excuse me,\nmonitoring your blood glucose.\nAnd you can look at it\nat an app on your phone,\nand you can learn a lot that\nway about how different foods\nimpact the increases in\ndecrease in blood glucose.\nIf you're doing experiments\nwith berberine or Metformin,\nyou can see how those\nimpact your blood glucose.\nYou can see how exercise\nhit training or otherwise\nimpacts blood glucose, excuse me again,\nit's very hard to assess blood\nglucose without a continuous\nblood glucose monitor, and\nif you're not using one,\nyou're mainly going to be relying\non subjective things like,\noh, I feel like I have low\nblood sugar, or I feel shaky.\nLike I have high blood sugar\nor shaky cause you have low\nblood sugar.\nSo I have to say that glucose\nclearing agents that involve a\nwalk or exercise moderate or\nintense are going to be a lot\neasier to titrate and adjust\nthe levels of then things that\nyou're going to take, where\nyou have to adjust the dosage.\nAnd then once you ingest a certain dosage,\nyou're along for the ride,\nat least until the effects of\nthat particular compound wear\noff, it doesn't mean those\nthings don't have utility.\nIt doesn't mean people aren't\nusing them because many people\nare, but they are potentially\na very sharp blade\nthat is a double sided blade.\nSo I encourage you to\napproach those with caution.\nIf you decide to at all,\nit's worth thinking about what\nthe low blood glucose state\nis and why it's beneficial as\nwell as why it might produce\nheadaches.\nAnd in some cases can also\nadjust the effects of other\nhormones in the fasted state,\na number of different proteins\nthat are expressed in cells\nundergo changes in their expression.\nWe talked about this\nearlier, when we are fasted,\nwe tend to reduce the activity\nof a particular protein\ncalled MTOR mammalian target of rapamycin.\nMTOR is very active in cells\nwhile they are growing.\nSo throughout development,\nit's also very active in\ncancers of various kinds.\nMTOR needs to be what's\ncalled phosphorylated.\nIf you don't know what that\nmeans, don't worry about it.\nBut phosphorylation is a manner\nin which certain proteins\nare altered so that they can\nactually be functional within\ncells,\nMTOR is associated with cell\ngrowth of all kinds healthy\nand unhealthy.\nWhen MTOR is phosphorylated,\nthere's a marker called PS6\nso phospho MTOR expressed as PM6.\nIf this is all escaping\nyou, don't worry about it.\nPhospho MTOR and PS6\nare reduced by fasting.\nNow, this makes sense.\nIf you think about it,\nbecause eating and growth are\nassociated with each other,\nfasting is not necessarily anti-growth,\nbut it is not pro\ngrowth, and when we fast,\nwe see increases in cells\nof things like AMPK,\nthe sirtuins, things like transcription\nfactors like FOX-O,\nATF and ketones or ketone bodies.\nYou may have heard of the ketogenic diet.\nWhat's the point of all\nthis biochemistry, it's not,\nyou just blitz you with a\nbunch of cellular biology and\nbiochemistry.\nIt's to say that we have cell\ngrowth pathways involving MTOR\nand PSX,\nand we have cell repair and\ncell shrinkage processes that\nare associated with AMPK,\nthe so-called sirtuins,\nwhich Dr. Davidson Claire\nfrom Harvard and others are famous for\ndiscovering and understanding\nthings like AMPK,\nthese two different divergent\npathways of cell growth and\ncell breakdown and repair\nand by breakdown, I mean,\nactual clearance autophagy, and repair.\nThose can be triggered by\nbeing in either the fed or the\nfasted state.\nSo one way I'd like you to\nthink about the fed state,\nnot just eating,\nbut having recently eaten\nor the fasted state,\nmeaning high blood glucose and,\nor you've recently eat eaten,\nor are currently eating\nor drinking calories,\nis that when you eat or when\nyou don't eat, when you're fed,\nwhen you're fasted,\nyou are either promoting\ncellular growth of all kinds or\nyou're promoting cellular repair\nand clearance of all kinds.\nAnd so, again,\nthis is about setting conditions\nin the brain and body.\nIt's not so much about\nwhen you eat food A or B,\nit leads to increases in MTOR,\nanytime you eat any food,\ndoesn't matter if it's plant-based,\nanimal-based fat, protein,\ncarbohydrate, doesn't matter.\nYou are biasing your system\ntowards a biochemical state of\ncell growth.\nAnd any time you haven't eaten\nfor a while or blood glucose\nis low,\nyou're biasing your system\ntoward a state of cellar repair.\nAnd this is why people who\ndo not suffer from any blood\nglucose regulation issues\ntake things like berberine as\nglucose, disposal agents,\nor take Metformin.\nI'm not necessarily\nsuggesting that you do that,\nbut it's because those\nthings mimic fasting.\nThey create situations in the\nbody that promote things like\nAMPKs, and sirtuins,\nand others to push your\nbody and your system\ndown a route of repair,\neven though you might have\njust eaten a meal an hour ago,\nalong the lines of the health\nbenefits of intermittent\nfasting, there are nice data\nshowing improvements in the gut\nmicrobiome and in particular,\nin the treatment of irritable\nbowel syndrome and other forms\nof colitis in time, restricted feeding,\nmeaning time-restricted feeding\nseems to be able to assist\npeople with those conditions,\nfollowing the general parameters\nthat I discussed before\neight hours and so forth.\nWhy and how, well, by way\nof intermittent fasting,\nimpacting the expression of\nthese various clock genes,\nand because the clock genes\nimpact the mucosal lining the\nmucus lining of the gut,\nit appears that intermittent\nfasting can reduce the amount\nof so-called lactobacillus\nthat's present in the gut.\nAnd lactose bacillus is when\nin high levels is correlated\nwith a number of different\nmetabolic disorders.\nAt the same time,\ntime-restricted feeding seems\nto enhance the proliferation\nof some of the gut microbiota,\nlike acetobacter and some of\nthe other ones that promote\nhealthy mucosal lining,\nand that promote better\noverall intestinal function.\nSo these are pathways that\nhave now been established,\nand it appears that\nintermittent fasting isn't just\nmodulating these processes,\nbut is actually having a direct\neffect on the mucosal lining\nin a way that favors a\nhealthier gut microbiome.\nSo it should come as no\nsurprise that many people who\nexperience gut issues benefit\nfrom restricting their feeding\nwindow to eight hours or so\nper every 24 hour period.\nThe other very exciting finding\nabout intermittent fasting\nis one of the major health issues\nthese days is the proliferation\nof so-called non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease,\n30 years or so non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease was\nexceedingly rare to see in the\nclinic, except in alcoholics,\nfatty deposits in the liver are bad.\nIt is essentially liver disease.\nNowadays children and\nadults are showing up with\nnon-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nSome of these people are\nobese, others are not,\nbut it's a serious health concern.\nAnd it's growing in numbers all the time.\nA recent study that was\npublished in Cell Reports\nMedicine just a couple of weeks\nago, tested the hypothesis,\nwhether or not the gut\nmicrobiome or so-called brown fat\ntissue is impacting the liver health.\nAnd in particular nonalcoholic\nfatty liver disease.\nThe short takeaway from this\nstudy is that contrary to what\nwas previously thought,\nthe gut microbiome,\nwhile very important for a\nnumber of other processes in the\nbody doesn't seem to be related\nto this non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease.\nThis is surprising to people\nor should be to those of you\nthat have been following the\ngut microbiome literature,\nhowever, brown fat,\nwhich is a healthy fat that we\nhave between our two scapulae\nand in our upper neck,\nit doesn't tend to be\nblubbery type fat pads,\nbut it sits deep to the skin,\nbut creates a thermogenic effect\nin the body that is helpful\nfor reducing the amount of other fat,\nthe type of fat that we're\nmore typically used to thinking\nabout and talking about\nwhite fat and pink fat that's\nsubcutaneous fat around\nthe abdomen and so forth.\nBrown fat seems to have a\ndirect correlation with the lack\nof non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.\nWhat this study showed was\nthat in people that have\ndiminished concentrations of brown fat,\nthere is a higher probability\nof having non-alcoholic fatty\nliver disease.\nNow the good news is brown\nfat stores can be increased.\nAnd again, this isn't going to\ncreate blubber of brown fat.\nThis is going to create increased\nthermogenesis and actually\nmake people leaner and brown\nfat has a number of other\nimportant positive effects.\nNow,\nthis is interesting because\ncold exposure of anywhere from\none to three minutes, two\nor four times per week,\nor maybe even 10 minutes,\ntwo to four times per week\ncan increase brown fat stores.\nAlso time-restricted feeding\nhas now been tied to the\ndensity of brown fat store.\nSo time-restricted feeding also\nseems to positively increase\nbrown fat stores,\nprobably because of the way\nthat brown fat stores relate to\nepinephrin and adrenaline,\nwhich tend to go up when we're fasted.\nWhat does this all mean?\nThis means for sake of\nliver health and for sake of\nreducing, or maybe preventing,\nor even potentially,\nI want to underline potentially\nreversing non-alcoholic\nfatty liver disease,\ntime-restricted feeding also\nappears to be beneficial.\nMany people out there are\ninterested in optimizing their\nhormones, and as we mentioned earlier,\ninsulin is a hormone and\ntime-restricted feeding seems to\nhave very positive effects on\noverall insulin profiles and\nso forth, but anytime\nyou mentioned hormones,\npeople immediately seem to leap\nto the sex steroid hormones,\ntestosterone, and estrogen,\nbecause indeed they have powerful effects,\nboth in the short-term and\nthe long-term in terms of our\nmental and physical\nhealth and performance.\nThere's at least one study\nthat's explored the effects of\ntime, restricted eating on performance,\nathletic performance, immune\nfunction, and body composition.\nThis was a study by Mauro, et al,\nthat was performed on elite cyclists.\nSo I want to point that out.\nI was a randomized control trial,\nbut what's really nice about\nthis study is that it explored\na number of different hormonal\nparameters in people that\nwere using time restricted eating,\nor that had a more extended eating window.\nAnd they tracked\neverything very carefully.\nAnd the amount of food they\nwere eating was actually pretty\nconsiderable, 4,800 calories,\nso that's a lot of calories,\nbut then again,\nthey were very active and\nthey've measured a number of\ndifferent things related\nto VO2 max, et cetera,\nperformance and overall performance\nat what they did cycling\nis not the point that I\nwant to emphasize here.\nAlthough there were some\npositive effects on their\nperformance related to\ntime-restricted eating, the point\nI want to talk about relates\nto things that presumably\nrelate to most, everybody,\nwhich are the effects on\nthings like glucose, thyroid,\nhormone, testosterone, sex,\nhormone, binding globulin,\nwhich can bind up testosterone\nand prevent the so-called\nfree form of testosterone,\nwhich is the one that has most\nof the actions in the brain\nand body.\nAnd the major takeaway\nfrom this study was that\ntime-restricted feeding of\nthe same amount of calories as\nthe so-called control\ncondition, okay, same calories,\nbut either compact throughout\nthe 24 hour cycle to an eight\nhour feeding window or allowing\nthem to eat over a larger\nfeeding window did lead to\nsignificant decreases in free\ntestosterone.\nAnd I think a number of people\nwill raise their eyebrows to\nthat and think, oh,\nwell then maybe time-restricted\nfeeding is not for me.\nThere are a number of important\nconsiderations, of course,\none is while they decrease\nin free testosterone was\nsignificant.\nIt's also going to depend\non where people start out.\nSo if somebody has already\nlower modest levels of\ntestosterone and it drops by 10 or 20%,\nthat could lead them into a\nstate of poor performance and\nwellbeing, whereas if somebody\nhas higher testosterone,\na decrease will necessarily do that.\nSo it's important to take\nthat into consideration.\nThis is why I'm always such\na fan of people doing their\nblood work and knowing what's\ngoing on under the hood for\nthem, a very change in\nhormonal profile was cortisol.\nSo-called stress, hormone cortisol,\nof course is also naturally\nreleased early in the day in a\nhealthy way to wake you\nup and promote alertness,\nbut you don't want its levels\nto be too high or to have\npeaks in cortisol late in the day,\nthat's actually correlated\nwith depression and a number of\nother untoured things.\nI would have thought that by\nrestricting a feeding window to\na particular time each day,\nthat these hard training\ncyclists would have undergone\nincreases in serum cortisol and in fact,\nthe opposite was true.\nThey had significant reductions\nin serum cortisol as a\nconsequence of time, restricted feeding.\nI should mention there were\nsignificant reductions in serum\ncortisol also in the control group,\nbut not to the same extent.\nAnd the two groups did\ndiffer significantly from one\nanother.\nNow this is important because\nif you just look at one\nhormone testosterone, you'd\nsay, okay, based on these data,\ntime-restricted feeding is\nreducing testosterone levels\nsignificantly,\neven though the number of\ncalories is quite high and is held\nconstant across the study, but in fact,\nbecause cortisol is lower,\nit may mean that the effects\nof testosterone or the\nreduction in testosterone is offset.\nAnd that's because cortisol\nand testosterone are always in\nthis somewhat of a dance\nin terms of cortisol,\ninhibiting the effects of\ntestosterone largely and vice\nversa.\nSo it is interesting and\nimportant to look at the total\ngallery of hormones.\nAnd they did look at a number of hormones.\nThey looked at other inflammatory markers.\nThose were not increased.\nThat's not surprising if you\nremember back to the 2012\nSatchin Panda study this\nearly pioneering study on time\nrestricted feeding.\nThey saw reductions in stress\nhormones and in inflammatory\nmarkers in time, restricted feeding mice.\nAnd here, this also seems\nto be the case in humans.\nSo the takeaway is for sake\nof hormone health, time\nrestricted feeding is\ncompatible with quality hormone\nhealth, even in high-performing athletes,\nbased on everything we know,\nand that we've discussed,\nI would not suggest that\npeople restrict their feeding\nwindow to less than eight hours,\nespecially if they're training\nhard on a regular basis.\nAnd it's not just athletes\nthat should pay attention to this,\nwhen we are working very hard,\nwhen we are psychologically\nstressed, when we are studying for exams,\nor we are in conflict with\nsomebody on a regular basis,\nthat creates a stress in the body\nthat's very similar to\nthat of physical training,\nthe body and brain don't\ndistinguish between physical stress\nand mental stress, it's\nall nervous system.\nRemember that it's just\ncortisol and adrenaline.\nThere's no special hormone\njust for physical stress versus\npsychological stress, so again,\nin thinking about what sort of\nfeeding window will be right\nfor you,\nwe arrive back at this eight\nhour time been that seems more\nor less flexible for most conditions,\neven high-performing elite athletes.\nAnd I would say just by logical extension,\neven for people that have a\nlot of stress in their life.\nAnd I personally wouldn't suggest\nthat people who have a lot\nof stress in their life where\nthe potential for stress in\ntheir life shorten their\nfeeding window much shorter than\neight hours,\nbecause then you would expect\nthat you would start to\nincrease some of the inflammatory markers.\nYou would increase the stress hormones,\nand you would be decreasing\nthings like testosterone and\nestrogen, some of the\nsex steroid hormones.\nSo again, it's all about context\nand the eight hour window,\nit isn't holy,\nbut seems to be a really useful\nguide to extract the great\nhealth benefits of\nwhich there are many in,\nof which we've discussed from\nintermittent fasting time,\nrestricted feeding.\nAnd yet that it could still be\ncompatible with decent social\nschedules and for maintaining\nhormone health in keeping with\nthis,\nfor women that are trying to\nmaintain ovulatory cycles or\nfor couples that are\ntrying to get pregnant.\nI think it's also important\nto not create a feeding window\nthat's too short.\nThe relationship between\nfeeding and body fat stores and\nglucose and leptin and hormones\nis a well-established one.\nAnd we can summarize it very easily here,\nalthough I've done several\nepisodes related to this\npreviously on optimizing hormone health.\nBut basically we undergo\npuberty when there's enough food\nand there's enough body fat\nthat the body fat sends a signal\nto the brain called leptin.\nThat's a hormone that comes\nfrom body fat signals to the\nbrain to turn on puberty that's puberty,\nbut even as adults for\nwomen that are menstruating,\nthere needs to be sufficient\nleptin signaling to the brain\nin order to maintain ovulation\nbecause of the way that the\nbrain communicates with the\npituitary and the ovaries.\nSimilarly for men fasting\nor extreme exercise plus\nfasting,\nwe now know reduces testosterone\nit's impacts are not\nexactly clear, however,\nif you reduce food intake,\neither in total calories\nor in duration too much,\nyou will suffer a drop in sperm\ncounts, fertility will drop.\nAnd this makes sense.\nThe body is communicating to the brain,\nwhether or not conditions\nare sufficient in the body to\nreproduce and to presumably,\nand hopefully support the\nhealth and wellbeing of those\noffspring.\nSo there's a logical link\nbetween body fat and eating and\nhow much food is available\nto you and how long it's\navailable to you and the signals\nin the brain that allow for\nreproductive success.\nThere are some data that pointed\ndifferences in the effects\nof intermittent fasting\nfor males versus females.\nThose data right now only come from mice,\nthat study was published\nby Satchin Panda recently,\nwe still await the studies in humans.\nSome people do not do well on\nintermittent fasting either in\nterms of mood or hormone health.\nAnd so everyone needs to determine\nfor themselves whether or\nnot having a time restricted\nfeeding window is good for\nthem.\nHow long that time-restricted\nfeeding window should be.\nI think eight hours is kind\nof a nice minimum to adhere to\nbased on everything that\nwe've covered today.\nAnd for some people time-restricted\nfeeding is not going to\nbe compatible with\nhormone health, for them,\nfor them eating more meals\nspread throughout the day,\npresumably smaller meals,\nsame caloric intake is going\nto be more beneficial for their\nhormones.\nThis is something that is\ngoing to be individual and is\ngoing to have to be determined\non an individual basis.\nHowever, if you're going to\ntry time restricted feeding,\nI do want to remind you that\ntaking a period of three to\nseven or ideally 10 days\nto transition into it,\nnot just going,\nflipping from eating to three\nmeals a day that span from\n6:00 AM to 10:00 PM and\nsuddenly going to an eight hour\nfeeding window,\nbut rather winnowing down that\nfeeding window about an hour\nor so per day is going to allow\nthe hormone systems of your\nbody, including leptin the\nhypocretin orexin system,\nwhich are systems within the\nbody, that signal to the brain,\nthat food is about to come\nallowing those systems to adjust\nso that you're not\noverwhelmingly hungry, irritable,\nand you're not throwing your\nwhole hormone system out of\nwhack.\nI keep coming back to this\neight hour feeding window,\nand I want to provide a\nlittle more basis for it.\nAnd just to encourage that\nit's not completely arbitrary.\nThe lengthy review that\nI mentioned earlier,\nfeatures a number of studies\nthat have used this eight hour\nfeeding window,\nbut there's a particular study\nthat I'd like to highlight\nmainly because I don't expect\npeople to delve into the full\nreference list of the other review.\nAnd this is a study that was carried out\nbetween Satchi Panda's lab\nand Krista Varady's labs.\nThis is a collaboration.\nThe study was carried out in\nhumans and is entitled effects\nof eight hour time restricted\nfeeding on body weight and\nmetabolic disease, risk factors\nin obese adults, excuse me.\nAnd this study essentially showed,\nI'll just read the conclusions\nthat an eight hour time\nrestricted feeding produces a\nmild caloric restriction and\nweight loss without calorie\ncounting, so that's key, right?\nThese people aren't calorie\ncounting somehow just by\nadhering to an eight hour window.\nThey are taking in fewer\ncalories than they're burning off\nand clinically it reduced blood pressure.\nSo I mentioned the study,\nnot because there aren't many\nothers involving the eight\nhour feeding window also in humans,\nbut because the eight hour\nfeeding window has been tested in\nobese adults and non obese adults.\nAnd there are even a\nfew studies in children.\nSo this eight hour window seems\nto be a really good rule of\nthumb and a kind of anchor\naround which we can each think\nabout incorporating\ntime restricted feeding.\nThere are of course,\nother patterns of feeding.\nAnd while some people have\nengaged in longer fasts of 24\nhours, 36 hours or more\nalternate day fasting,\nmeaning eating one day,\nnot eating the next day or in\nsome cases eating one day and\neating very few calories,\n500 or 600 calories\nthe next day has been tested.\nA few studies have also\nlooked at eating a sort of\nmaintenance level of\ncalories for five days,\nand then taking two days\nand fast clear through,\nor eating very few calories,\nyou know, 300 or 500 calories.\nIn fact,\nthere's a sort of a community\nonline of people that are\nexploring longer,\nfast for sake of trying to\noffset dementia or reverse\neffects of dementia, thus\nfar, at least in my awareness,\nthere isn't any quality clinical\npeer reviewed study on that\nyet for sake of dementia,\nalthough I await those studies,\nand if anyone's aware of them,\nplease send me a link in the comments.\nBut alternate day fasting has\ngotten the so-called safe bill\nof health.\nThis has been written up meaning\nthat people didn't suffer\nbone loss, they didn't suffer\nany major detrimental effects.\nIt does seem that it can create\nsignificant weight loss and\ncan help with obese individuals\nthat it can reduce resting\nblood glucose,\nand every other day fasting\nin many cases can produce more\nrapid effects on weight loss\nand reductions in blood glucose\nthan time restricted feeding, however,\nevery other day type fasting\nfor most people is not going to\nbe feasible.\nThey're just not going to be\nable to do that for a long\nperiod of time.\nAnd what hasn't really been\ndone is the follow-up to see\nwhether or not people who do\nevery other day fasting or five\ndays of eating followed\nby two days of fasting,\nwhether or not that leads\nto a rebound in weight gain,\nwhether or not that leads to\na rebound in blood glucose,\net cetera.\nSo for now the eight hour feeding\nwindow and time restricted\nfeeding seems to be the most tested,\nsupported in animal studies and\nin human studies and the one\naround which I think\nmost people should orient\nif they're considering getting\ninto time-restricted feeding,\nit's also sort of hard to\nimagine how one could include a\nsignificant exercise schedule\nor work schedule on every\nother day fasting.\nRemember, in any study, people\nare often being compensated,\nor at least are incentivized\nin some way to adhere to the\nstudy.\nThis is one of the major issues\nthat I have with any study\nthat says that three or four\ndifferent diets are essentially\nequal in terms of their\nability to produce weight loss.\nAdherence is very different\nin the outside world where you\ndon't have a researcher\nmonitoring you where you're not\nlogging all your food.\nMost people don't do that consistently.\nAnd we can take a little bit\nof a neuroscience perspective\non this to try and arrive\nat what the best kind of\norganization of an eating plan,\nor if we wanted to call it a diet,\nwe could would be for you.\nMany people find it easier\nto just not eat for certain\nperiods of each 24 hour cycle\nthan to eat smaller portions,\nportion control is very\nhard for some people,\nfor other people it's\nmanageable, but people like me.\nI don't eat half the croissant.\nI don't think it's a real thing, it's not,\nit's not available to me, I should say.\nNow, of course I could\neat just half a croissant,\nbut I noticed that when\nI eat the croissant,\nbecause they're so delicious\nthat it creates a rise in blood\nglucose a rise in the other\nhormones and chemicals that are\nassociated with ingesting\ndelicious, highly palatable food.\nAnd it's actually a lot of work\nfor me to just eat half the\ncroissant.\nThere's something that's much\nmore thoroughly satisfying\nabout eating the entire croissant.\nAnd actually there's something\nthat somewhat satisfying\nabout not eating the croissant at all.\nAnd just knowing that later I\ncan eat the whole croissant.\nNow that's me.\nOther people find that they\ndon't have any trouble with\nportion control that for them\njust eating small bits of food\nthroughout the day is what\nsets them in the right\npsychological and physical\nstate for sake of work,\net cetera.\nAnd I mentioned work and\nmental focus because one of the\naspects of fasting that have\ndrawn a lot of people to time\nrestricted feeding and fasting\nis the clarity of mind that\npeople get.\nWhen first of all,\nthey don't have to think about\nwhen they're going to eat\nbecause they know when\ntheir eating window begins.\nThey also don't have to\nthink about regulating their\nbehavior because they already\nknow when they're going to eat\nand when they're not going to eat.\nWhereas when you're restricting portions,\nyou actually have to make\ndecisions all the while.\nYou know, and I think I like\nmany people decide, well,\nyou know, is that exactly half?\nOr could I have like another\nwrong on the croissant?\nThis kind of thing. I\ndon't negotiate with food.\nThat's why I like a time\nrestricted feeding window.\nI know I'm going to eat for, in my case,\nI use a 10 hour feeding window or so,\nand I'll eat the whole croissant.\nI just don't have to think about it, now,\nthe food choices that you make\ninside of that feeding window\nare of course also going\nto be very important.\nCertain foods will increase blood glucose,\nsuch that you're going to\nget hungrier and hungrier.\nOthers will maintain lower\nblood glucose and will allow you\nto be more controlled in\nthe foods that you pursue.\nThose are all individual\nconsiderations that are deserving\nof their own entire episode.\nBut I do want to point out\nthat the advantage of time\nrestricted feeding is that\nit involves a lot of the\ndecision-making in the brain.\nThe so-called go no-go\ncircuitries of our basal ganglia,\nif you want to know this\nareas that control them.\nAnytime we have to restrict a behavior,\nthat's called a no-go.\nAnytime we engage in a\nbehavior, that's a go,\nno go behaviors require a\nlot of what's called top-down\ncontrol, and it's very\nmetabolically demanding.\nAnd so time restricted feeding\nallows you to depart from the\nwhole no-go go negotiation that\nyou have to undergo when you\nhave to restrict portions.\nAnd so I think this is a\nreason why many people have\ngravitated towards time\nrestricted feeding and why for\npeople that don't want to have\nto think about all that it's\njust very straight forward.\nOne of the more hot button\nissues out there is whether or\nnot given equal amounts of\ncaloric intake and equal amounts\nof activity and equal amounts\nof nutrients, et cetera,\nwhether or not restricting\nfood to a particular window\nbiases,\nmore weight loss toward fat\nloss versus loss of other\ntissues, because of course,\nwhen we lose weight,\nwe can lose that from any number\nof different storage sites\nwithin the body, muscle\nwater, glycogen, or fat.\nNow this is such a hot button\nissue that I almost don't want\nto get into it, but I'm\ngoing to get into it anyway,\nbecause there are data\nthat are very interesting.\nThis is covered in the review\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nthat describes how if people\nfollow a time-restricted\nfeeding schedule for long periods of time.\nSo 60 days or longer,\nthere's some metabolic\nchanges in the way that people\nmetabolize energy that do seem\nto shift the system toward\nmore fat loss relative to burning\nof other tissues when in a\nstate of caloric restriction.\nAnd I want to say when in a\nstate of caloric restriction,\nbecause there's really no\nway to cheat the system,\nthere's no way that you can\ningest far more calories than\nyou burn or excrete, when\nI say excrete, you know,\nI certainly don't suggest\nthis, but there, you know,\nbulimics and other people that\nhave eating disorders will\nuse laxatives at a way to\neliminate food quickly from their\nsystem\nso it can't be converted into\nfat or other forms of energy.\nThat's a very, in that case,\nit's a pathological situation,\nbut in general calories\nin versus calories out,\nas I mentioned earlier as this\nkind of foundational element,\nbut in states of caloric restriction,\nmeaning sub maintenance intake,\ntime-restricted feeding does\nseem to buy us more of the\nenergy burned to compensate\nfor that deficit from fat and\nthe way it accomplishes\nit is very interesting.\nIt turns out that it drives\nmore fat loss by way of\nincreasing a hepatic lipase.\nThis is something called LAPC\nhepatic means of the liver and\nlipase, which anytime you hear\nASC is means it's an enzyme.\nSo it seems to increase hepatic lipase.\nSo it increases the enzyme\nthat metabolizes fat for\nlipolysis and energy production\nand reduces something called\nCIDEC, CIDEC.\nwhich is a lipid droplet\nassociated and lipolysis inhibitor.\nNow that's a mouthful, no pun intended,\nbut what CIDEC really is\nthis lipid droplet associated\nmolecule is it can inhibit lipolysis.\nSo extended periods of\ntime, restricted feeding,\nmeaning eight hour feeding\nwindow or 10 hour feeding window\nthat's obeyed for several months\nor more seems to allow the\nsystem to shift toward burning\nmore fat or rather using a\nhigher percentage of fat\nwhen in a caloric deficit.\nNow I doubt that this is going\nto resolve the truly barbed\nwire, almost hairball,\nridiculous online debates\nabout whether or not\ntime-restricted feeding is\nbetter than another feeding\nschedule, look,\nI don't think any particular\nfeeding schedule is holy.\nIf you are sub caloric,\nmeaning fewer calories burned\nthan calories ingested,\nyou're going to lose weight.\nBut the data seemed to point\nto the fact that if you do time\nrestricted feeding for a\nfairly long duration of time,\nand you maintain that,\nthat you are increasing\nthese lipases that increase\nlipolysis energy use from fat,\nand you're decreasing the lipid\ndroplet associated lipolysis\ninhibitors.\nSo it's both a you're removing\nthe break and you're pressing\non the accelerator of fat loss.\nI think that this logically\npoints to a case in which using\ntime restricted feeding with\na sub caloric intake seems to\nbe at least to my mind,\nthe most scientifically\nsupported way to ensure that a\nsignificant portion of the\nweight that one loses is from\nbody fat stores.\nAny discussion about fasting\nwould be incomplete without a\ndiscussion about what does\nand does not break a fast.\nHowever,\nthere is no black and white\nanswer to that question,\nand you should immediately\nunderstand why it's because\neating and not eating are not\nequivalent to fed and fasted.\nIt depends on when you ate\nhow much you ate and where you\nare in your circadian cycle.\nWe can actually arrive at a\nsimple answer to whether or not\nsomething breaks the fast or not.\nNow the technical way to go\nabout this would be to wear a\ncontinuous glucose monitor\nand to ingest little bits of\nfood, of different kinds\nor large amounts of food,\nof different kinds and\nmeasure blood glucose,\nbecause ultimately blood glucose\nis the readout of whether\nor not your system is in\na fed or fasted state.\nThere are other parameters too, of course,\nbut that's the dominant one\nin so far as the scientific\nliterature says drinking water\nwill not break your fast\ndrinking tea will not break your\nfast drinking coffee,\nprovided it as black coffee\nwill not break your fast\ningesting caffeine in pill\nform will not break your fast.\nThere are other things\nthat won't break your fast.\nFor instance,\neating one peanut when deep in\na fasted state will not break\nyour fast, eating a whole\nhandful of peanuts might not even\nbreak your fast if you are\nin a very low glucose state.\nHowever,\nif you just finished a meal\nthat included carbohydrates,\nor it was a very large meal\nof any kind an hour ago, yes,\nindeed, eating one peanut\ncould break your fast.\nSo it's all contextual, that's\nwhat's really important to understand,\nunless you're going to wear\na continuous glucose monitor.\nAnd unless you are going to\nwear a continuous glucose\nmonitor and set an absolute\nnumerical threshold for what it\nis to break your fast.\nI think there are some simple\nrules that we can follow.\nFirst of all, anything that\ninvolves sugar in particular,\nsimple sugars can\npotentially break your fast.\nAnd there's actually a study on this,\nwhich shows that if\npeople ingest even one,\none gram of sugar post dinner,\nif they had a full meal for\ndinner that can actually disrupt\nthe expression of some of the\ncircadian genes related to\nfasting and to sleep and\nsleep related fasting.\nNow that's pretty extreme,\nalmost kind of scary to think about,\nbut that's how sensitive our system is.\nIf we already have somewhat\nelevated blood glucose from a\nmeal that we ate an hour or so ago,\nwhereas if we have run\nfor an hour or train hard,\nhigh intensity training,\nand we haven't quite reached\nthe beginning of our so-called\nfeeding window, will eating\na small amount of food\ntake us out of that fast?\nWell, depends on what the food is.\nIf it's mostly fat,\nprobably not, a number of\npeople out there nowadays\ntalk about so-called fat fasting,\nfat fasting as a way to kind\nof regal past the stringency of\neither eating or not eating\nas a black and white rule for\nfeeding window versus non feeding window.\nSo some people will ingest\nmedium chain triglycerides\nso-called MCTs,\nor people will ingest fats only\nuntil their official feeding\nwindow begins.\nSo these are sort of how the\nnegotiations that people carry\nout tend to go.\nBut that of course won't increase\nblood glucose and insulin\nas much as carbohydrates will,\nprotein will have sort of\nan intermediate effect.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\ningesting carbohydrates with\nsome fat will tend to blunt the\nrise in glucose and will\nextend the duration over which\nglucose is released.\nSo we really can't say food X\nor beverage X breaks a fast,\nhowever, at the extremes, we\ncan say that, for instance,\nif you drink a can of soda pop,\nunless you just ran an ultra marathon,\nyou're breaking your fast,\nokay, eat a piece of pizza,\nYou're breaking your fast,\nyou eat purely fats, maybe,\nprobably not.\nIf you've been fasting for\nfive hours or more strictly\nfasting for five hours or more.\nSo you can start to see where\nthere's a lot of wiggle room\nand it's very contextual.\nAnd this is why any posts that\nyou see or any information\nthat you see that something\ndoes or does not break your\nfast,\nthat doesn't place it in the\ncontext of when the last time\nyou ate and what you ate and\nyour activity and your time\nwithin the circadian clock\nschedule of 24 hours,\nit's a sort of meaningless\ndiscussion, so in general,\nI think what's really useful\nif you're not going to wear a\ncontinuous glucose monitor is\nto try and be fairly strict\nabout when you initiate your\nfeeding window and when you\nstop your feeding window\nand as time evolves and you\nestablish a more regular routine\nof eating certain kinds of\nfoods and not others that are\nright for you because as I've\nemphasized before on this podcast,\nand I will continue to emphasize\nketo works great for some\npeople, vegetarian keto\nworks great for some people,\ncarnivore diet works\ngreat for other people.\nSome people are omnivores,\nsome people are carnivores,\nsome people are vegan.\nAll of that is great and fine by me.\nEveryone has to establish\nwhat's right for them, today,\nwe've really bypass the\ndiscussion about foods of a\nparticular origin or type\nanimal-based or plant-based.\nBut all the same rules apply\nwithin this thing that we're\ncalled intermittent fasting\nor time restricted feeding.\nSo what breaks a fast will\ndepend and what you want to eat\nor what you are willing to eat.\nThat's a totally separate\nmanner from when you eat.\nBut as we've established, when\nyou eat is vitally important,\nsome of you are probably wondering\nwhether or not artificial\nsweeteners or non artificial\nplant-based sweeteners like\nStevia break a fast,\nthis will vary somewhat.\nAnd I have to say the data\non this are somewhat mixed.\nThere is evidence that when\npeople ingest artificial\nsweeteners,\nthat it can create a transient\nincrease in blood glucose\nfollowed by a transient\ndecrease in blood glucose below\nbaseline.\nThis is thought to explain the\nincrease in hunger caused by\ningestion of things like\naspartame and sucralose and things\nof that sort.\nThere are not a lot of\ngood studies exploring the\nplant-based non sugar\nsweeteners, things like Stevia,\neven things like monk fruit,\nwhich is a separate category unto itself.\nThere aren't a lot of studies on this.\nI think most people need to\nestablish this for themselves.\nThe best way of course,\nwould be to wear a continuous\nglucose monitor to go into a\nfasted state of either\none hour or two hours,\nor maybe you've been fasting\nall night and then ingest\nStevia in whatever form you\nwant or coffee in whatever form\nyou want with sucralose\nor aspartame, et cetera,\nsetting aside the discussion\nabout the effects of these\nthings on the gut microbiome,\nwhich is a different topic entirely.\nI think it's fair to\nsay that in moderation,\nthe plant-based non sugar\nsweeteners like Stevia in\nparticular,\nStevia seemed to have a\nminimal impact on overall blood\nglucose when considered over\na fairly large time been\naspartame, and sucralose, saccharin.\nI think we can say more or less the same,\nbut as soon as you get into\na discussion about those,\nyou also have to get into a\ndiscussion about some of the\nevidence published in nature\nand other excellent journals\nnow pointing to the fact\nthat when consumed in excess,\nnot when consumed in moderation,\nbut when consumed in excess\nthat those might have some\ndetrimental effects on the gut microbiome.\nSo do artificial sweeteners break a fast?\nIt depends on the amount\ndepends on the type.\nAnd in general,\nI think you're probably okay\nprovided that you're not\nindulging in them too often, however,\nsome people just by virtue\nof tasting something sweet,\nfeel a spike in their appetite\nthat makes it harder for them\nto adhere to the feeding window.\nAnd so this is why you can\nimagine that a really well\ncontrolled study on this would\nbe very hard to carry out.\nAnd I'm not really sure that\nit's worth our tax dollars to\nactually design and carry\nout a study like that because\nthere would be so much\nindividual variation in terms of\ndiscipline in adhering\nto the feeding window,\nwhether or not people experience\nincreases and drops in\nblood glucose, how that impacts them,\nwhether or not they're exercising.\nIt just becomes an infinite\nvariable space, as we say,\nin experimental science.\nSo you really have to\ndetermine that for you,\nbut I don't think that we can\nfairly say that artificial\nsweeteners break a fast.\nI think that would be\nincorrect to say earlier,\nwe were talking about\nglucose disposal agents,\nboth behavioral and compound\nbased things like Metformin and\nberberine, and in fact,\ncinnamon is even a mild\nglucose disposal agent.\nIt can actually reduce blood\nglucose, lemon and lime juice,\nbelieve it or not, can\nlower blood glucose.\nYou may have experienced this\nbefore of eating something\nvery,\nvery sweet and almost feeling\nkind of overwhelming on a\npoisoned by how sweet it is,\nespecially if you're not\naccustomed to eating a lot of\nsugary things.\nOne quick remedy for that is\nactually a half lime or half\nlemon squeezed into juice and\ndrinking that just by virtue\nof the taste and by virtue of\nthe fact that it will reduce\nblood glucose.\nYou'll notice that that\neffect almost immediately\ndisappears, that's not magic.\nThat's the effects of acidity\non blood glucose levels.\nSo there are a number of\nthings that can adjust blood\nglucose, they're not\nnecessarily disposal agents,\nthey're not sweeping it out\nof the bloodstream in the same\nway that berberine or Metformin would,\nor that high intensity exercise\nat the appropriate times of\nday would.\nBut there is one particular\nthing that one can ingest that\ncan help manage psychologically\nand performance wise through\nthe fasting portion of the\nintermittent fasting and get you\nto your feeding window.\nAnd that's salt.\nI've talked a little bit about\nthis on the podcast before,\nbut because neurons use salt,\nsodium and potassium and magnesium,\nthe so-called electrolytes in\norder to perform their magic\nof chemical and electrical signaling,\neverything you do depends on chemical,\nelectrical signaling and all\nthat chemical and electrical\nsignaling requires electrolytes\nin some form or another\nneurons run on the passage of\nions like sodium in and out of\ntheir cell membranes are, I should say,\nacross their cell\nmembranes to be accurate.\nMany people find that the\nkind of lightheadedness,\nthe shakiness that's accustomed\nwith having slightly low\nblood sugar can be offset by\ntaking a half teaspoon or so of\nsea salt,\nor even just a tiny pinch of\nsalt and putting into some\nwater and drinking it.\nSome people find because of\nthe glucose lowering effects of\nacidity, that if they're feeling\nkind of shaky and not well,\nand they put some lemon juice\ninto water and drink that it\ndrops their blood glucose further.\nSo there's a common practice\nnowadays that's discussed on\nthe internet of waking up\ndrinking some water with some lime\nor lemon juice in it with\na little pinch of salt.\nI think that little pinch\nof salt is a good idea.\nWhat is it doing, how is\nit offsetting all this?\nWell,\nsalt water actually has a mild\neffect as a glucose disposal\nagent, but it has a stabilizing\neffect on blood volume.\nAnd so,\nbecause sodium brings with\nit water and the so-called\nosmolarity of your blood in\nyour body depends on the salt\nlevels in your blood and brain and body.\nMany people find that\nthey're feeling shaky.\nThey're feeling lightheaded.\nThey can't concentrate.\nThey think they need sugar or food,\nbut what will actually\nremedy that is some salt.\nAnd I know a number of people\nthat have incorporated this\npractice and have written to\nme and saying, oh, you know,\nif I just take a little\nbit of salt in some water,\nthey may or may not include\nthe lemon or lime juice.\nThey immediately feel better\nand find that it's actually\nquite straightforward to get out to that,\nto wait until the feeding window kicks in.\nThis is especially true for\npeople that are using caffeine\nbecause when you ingest caffeine,\nyou actually excrete a lot of water,\nit has a diarrhetic effect.\nAnd with that water goes salt.\nSo it actually causes\nyou to excrete sodium.\nNow the role of sodium in\nblood pressure and hypertension\nis, you know, quite\ncontroversial science magazine,\none of the premier scientific\njournals out there had a\nspecial issue all about\nsalt some years ago,\ntalking about the research\naround hypertension,\nindeed people with chronic\nhypertension or high blood\npressure or very high blood\npressure in particular should be\nwary of ingesting too much sodium.\nBut for most people ingesting\nsodium provided they drink\nenough water and they don't\nhave chronic hypertension or\nhigh blood pressure is\nactually beneficial.\nNow that doesn't mean you\nshould be drinking seawater\ndoesn't mean you should\nbe overindulging in salt,\nbut many people find that they\ncan manage their mental and\nphysical state and even\nfeel really terrific,\nreal clarity of mind,\nand really enjoy their\nfast when they're ingesting\nsufficient salt.\nAnd all it requires really\nis a small pinch of salt,\nideally Himalayan or sea salt.\nIf you want to get fancy about it,\nbut table salt would be fine.\nAnd just drinking that in some water,\nmaybe with lemon or lime juice\nto offset the taste a little\nbit can really stabilize one's\njitters and can stabilize the\nmind, and you might also notice\ncan offset that churning and\nyearning and appetite where\nyou can't imagine going another\nfive minutes before eating\nsomething suddenly you feel okay.\nAnd that has to do with a lot\nof the effects of blood volume\ncaused by ingesting salt\nin the appropriate amounts.\nIn other words, sometimes\nyou think you need food,\nbut what you really need to\nsalt and salt can make you feel\nbetter immediately.\nI'd like to mention too\nexcellent zero cost resources.\nIf you're going to explore\ntime restricted feeding,\nor maybe if you already are\ndoing time restricted feeding,\nI have no affiliation to either of these.\nThe first is the website\nthat I mentioned before, My\nCircadian Clock,\nwhich is the website hosted by\nSatchin Panda and colleagues.\nThere are a lot of resources\nthere where you can log your\nfood intake,\nget information about\ntime-restricted feeding all the\nscience, the ongoing studies, et cetera.\nThe other is the so-called Zero app.\nThat makes it very easy to\nmark when you're beginning your\nfeeding window and when you're\nending your feeding window\nand in,\nso doing marking when you are\nbeginning your fast and ending\nor fast,\nwhere at least initiating the\nbeginning of the unfed state,\nas we could more accurately\ncall it, it's a terrific app.\nI've used it from time to time.\nI don't tend to use it in an\nongoing basis because I'm just\nsort of used to eating at a\nparticular time of day now.\nBut anytime I've shifted\nthat window, for instance,\na few weeks ago,\nI started moving that protein\nintake in my entire feeding\nwindow earlier in the day.\nAnd because that takes\nsome attention on my part,\nbecause I'm not used to doing that.\nI've been using the Zero app\nand I like it quite a lot.\nIt logs your progress and it\ngives you averages and you can\nsee how many other\npeople are fasting again,\ntotally zero cost. I actually\ndon't know who owns that app,\nbut I think they've done an excellent job.\nThe interface is really\nterrific, and as far as I know,\nit's available for Apple and Android,\nbut it's at least\navailable for Apple phones,\nwhich is the type of\nphone I happen to have.\nSo check those out, My Circadian Clock.\nYou just put that into\nGoogle, you'll find it.\nAnd the Zero app, both\nexcellent zero cost resources.\nIn a moment I'd like to review\nthe parameters of a ideal\nfeeding schedule for you and\ngive you the variables that you\ncan plug into your lifestyle\nand your preferences.\nThere are a couple of things\nthat I would place into the\ncategory of frequently asked somewhat odd,\nbut still worthy of discussion.\nFor instance,\npeople have asked will brushing\nyour teeth with toothpaste,\nbreak your fast?\nI think unless you're\nswallowing the toothpaste, no.\nNow if you really want to\nrun out and get a continuous\nglucose monitor and brush your teeth,\nand you can evaluate that,\nbut no people have asked will\na half glass of wine after\ndinner a couple hours after\ndinner break your fast.\nAbsolutely.\nIt absolutely will.\nAnd it's been demonstrated to\ndo that based on the one gram\nof sugar,\nkind of eerie or scary effect\nthat I talked about before,\nscary and eerie,\nbecause it just seems\nlike one gram of sugar.\nHow could it do that?\nBut these are metabolic\nprocesses and they are very\nsensitive, post-meal, a few months back,\nI did an experiment wearing\na continuous glucose monitor.\nAnd I got a surprise when I\ndiscovered that going into a\nsauna increases my blood\nglucose quite a bit.\nIt actually spikes it as high as a meal.\nAnd then it tends to drop\nback down to baseline or even\nslightly below baseline afterwards,\nwhen I talk to people about\nthis, somebody said, oh,\nit's got to be that the\ncontinuous glucose monitor was\ngetting disrupted by\nthe heat in the sauna.\nThat's actually not the case.\nTurns out that when you go in a sauna,\nbecause you dehydrate,\nyou're losing water,\nI wasn't drinking water and\nyou're dropping a lot of water.\nThe concentration of sugar in\nyour blood actually goes up.\nAnd I actually put these data\nout in a social media post on\nTwitter,\nand people were kind of shocked\nto see how much a sauna can\nspike your blood glucose,\nnow I do practice time,\nrestricted feeding, intermittent fasting.\nI'm not super strict about it.\nI use a kind of eight to 10\nhour ish window either early in\nthe day or late in the day.\nI saw this effect of\nthe sauna, personally,\nthe psychological and physical\nhealth effects of the sauna\nare valuable enough to me\nthat I continue to use it.\nI'm just not concerned about\nthis increase in blood glucose,\nto the extent that I'm\ngoing to eliminate sauna.\nI like to use the sauna three\nor four times a week before\nsleep, so I'll use it an\nhour or two before sleep.\nAnd yes,\nindeed it creates this big\nspike in blood glucose that then\ndrops based on change in the\nconcentration of blood sugar.\nI'm just not going to worry about it, now,\nif you're concerned about\nblood glucose spikes,\nthen you might be worried\nabout it, but in my case,\nit was one of those things\nwhere it was interesting and it\nwas worthy of discussion.\nI thought because it was\nsomewhat surprising to me,\nalthough it makes perfect sense\nwhy this would be the case,\nbut at the end of the day, literally,\nit just makes sense for\nme to get in the sauna.\nOkay. So now you've\nheard a lot of science.\nYou've heard a lot of\nexamples, even a few anecdotes,\nand let's come up with the\nideal intermittent fasting,\nAKA time, restricted\nfeeding schedule for you.\nAnd when I say ideal, I mean,\nwhat are the variables\nthat are negotiable?\nWhat are the ones that are non-negotiable?\nWhat is ideal for you will\ndepend on the context of your\nlife and what you are\nwilling to do consistently.\nSo, first of all,\nwe established based on the\ndiscussion with Satchin,\nwho is truly the premier\nworld expert in this area,\nwho knows the animal and human\nscientific literature better\nthan anybody has written\nthis incredible review.\nAnd for whom I consulted that\nyou do not want to ingest\nfood for at least I want to\nemphasize at least 60 minutes\npost waking up, second,\nyou want to avoid ingesting\nany food of any kind,\neven one gram of sugar, remember,\nthis is the ideal one gram of\nsugar even would be too much\nfor the two to three\nhours prior to bedtime.\nHe also mentioned, ideally,\nyou are spending eight hours in bed.\nI didn't tell you that\nearlier. I saved that for now,\nbut ideally you are sleeping\nthat entire eight hours,\nbut simply by being in bed for\nthat eight hours and avoiding\nfood after waking for an hour\nand before bed for two to\nthree hours,\nyou're starting to build out\nthe duration of this fasted\nperiod.\nRemember that the sleep\nrelated fasting is particularly\nimportant for the health\nbenefits of time-restricted\nfeeding.\nAgain,\nthe sleep-related fasting is\nespecially important because of\nall the cellar repair processes\nthat occur in the liver and\nthe gut in the microbiome, in\nthe brain all over the body.\nAnd because of the way that\nthat coordinates the expression\nof the clock genes that are\nthen going to wick out and have\nmany other positive effects on health,\nincluding weight and fat loss.\nBut in addition to that\nliver health, et cetera,\nan eight hour feeding window\nas a target seems to be the\nbest target feeding, at least\nby my read of the literature.\nAnd in discussing it with\nshuts such in shorter feeding\nwindows of four to six hours,\ntend to lead to overeating\nand potentially increases in\nweight.\nOne meal per day type eating\ndo not seem to do that,\nbut those are special cases in\nthat most people can't adhere\nto a one meal per day type schedule,\nat least not on a regular basis.\nAnd it's not very compatible\nwith most social schedules.\nAlthough some people may be\nable to adhere to that in a\nstraightforward way,\nbut there aren't any robust\nstudies exploring the advantages\nof one meal per day.\nSo if you feel there are\nadvantages of one meal per day for\nyou as opposed to an\neight hour feeding window,\nwell then by all means,\nuse a one meal per day approach\nor use a four to six hour\nfeeding window and just make\nsure you don't overeat in that\nwindow.\nRemember that most people tend\nto not adhere to the eight\nhour feeding window, they say eight hours,\nbut they tend to eat outside\nof the eight hours a little bit\non each side, so if your goal\nis a 10 hour feeding window,\nyou might want to set it to\nnine hours or eight hours.\nIf your goal is six hours,\nyou might want to set it\nto seven or eight hours.\nAnd this is simply based by,\nI shouldn't say simply\nthis is based on thousands,\nif not tens of thousands of\nhuman subject data points that\nSatchin and colleagues have collected\nregular placement of the eating\nwindow or feeding window,\nevery 24 hours is important.\nYou don't have to be absolutely\nrigid and neurotic about\nthis,\nbut you don't want it sliding\naround on the weekends so that\nit starting two hours later\nand ending two hours later,\na couple days a week,\nbecause then you start to offset\nmany of the positive health\neffects that have been\ndemonstrated for time restricted\nfeeding.\nRemember if you eat your\nfood within a certain feeding\nwindow, but that feeding window\nshifts by a couple of hours,\nit is effectively like\njet lagging your system.\nIt is effectively like traveling\na couple times zones over\neating there for a few days\nand coming back when in fact\nyou're not traveling,\nthat's because of the\nway that food adjusts,\nthe circadian clock genes.\nNow you can offset some of\nthat through the use of light.\nAnd I've talked extensively\nabout how to use light in\nprevious podcasts, but again,\nearly morning and all day bright,\nlight exposure as safely as\nyou can, ideally from sunlight,\nnot through a window, et cetera,\navoiding bright light in\nthe middle of the night,\nextremely important for mood offsetting,\nmetabolic dysfunction, et cetera,\nnot incidentally Satchin's early work was,\nhe was one of the three\nco-discoverers of the cells in the\neye, the so-called melanopsin\ncells that set the central\ncircadian clock. So he was\na pioneer in that field,\nwhich led him to be a pioneer\nin this field and so on.\nWhen should that eight hour\nwindow be placed within each 24\nhour cycle? Well, let's\ntalk about ideal ideal.\nIf you really want to maximize\nall the health benefits of\ntime-restricted feeding,\nyou need to extend the fast\naround sleep on both sides.\nYou would place it smack dab\nin the middle of the day.\nIt would be a schedule in\nwhich you started eating for\ninstance at 10:00 AM. And you\nstopped eating at 6:00 PM.\nAn absolutely dreadful schedule\nfor anyone that wants to\nhave some semblance of a\nnormal life. In my opinion,\nit's not really compatible\nwith most schedules.\nAlthough some people\nmight be able to do it,\nmaybe you and your family or\nyour friends, your, you know,\nyou're eating a late breakfast or a,\nand then you're having a\nlate-ish lunch around 2:00 PM.\nAnd then you have dinner at six.\nAnd then assuming that you\ngo to bed around nine 30 or\n10:00 PM,\nthat is going to extract\nthe maximum amount of weight\nrelated body fat related metabolic\nfactor related aspects of\ntime, restricted feeding.\nSome people tend to fall into\na category where they do best\nplacing that feeding window\nlater in the day and provided\nit. Doesn't run too close to your sleep.\nRemember you needed a two or\nthree hour buffer before your\nsleep,\nwhere you're not ingesting\nanything that's in order to\nextract the benefits of\ntime-restricted feeding.\nWell then starting your\nfeeding window at 12:00 PM and\nending at 8:00 PM plus or\nminus half an hour or so day to\nday, it seems like a perfectly\nreasonable schedule for some\npeople starting at 2:00 PM\nand ending at 10:00 PM will be\nthat schedule.\nOf course,\nyou have to take into\nconsideration when you exercise.\nIf you exercise.\nFor instance, I like to exercise\nearly in the day if I run,\nor if I do some moderate or\nlight intensity exercise,\nregardless of what type of exercise it is,\nI have no trouble waiting until\nmy feeding window kicks in\naround noon or even 2:00 PM.\nBut if I do high intensity\nweight training, for instance,\nearly in the day,\nor if I run sprints and I do\nthat at 7:00 AM or 8:00 AM by\n11:00 AM, I am very,\nvery hungry and it's hard\nfor me to do other things\nconcentrate, et cetera.\nNow I'm not neurotic\nabout my feeding window.\nAs I mentioned before,\nI kind of let it expand and\ncontract a bit around the eight\nhour mark, and feel perfectly\nfree to do that too.\nWe're talking here in, in ideals,\nnot in necessarily practicals,\nbut other people find that\nthey're very hungry when they\nwake up early in the day.\nIf you're one of these people\nor you're somebody who really\nis trying to emphasize hypertrophy\nor maintenance of muscle,\nthen it does seem that ingesting\nprotein early in the day is\nbeneficial.\nThat it can be more readily\nconverted into muscle tissue.\nAnd this has been demonstrated\nin at least one study.\nThere's another study underway.\nThat's exploring this further\nfor people that are really,\nreally interested in hypertrophy\nand building muscle will\nthen time-restricted feeding\nis usually not the way they go.\nI mean, let's be honest.\nThere are many people out\nthere who are eating four more\nmeals per day,\nand they're doing that\nfrom 7:00 AM until 8:00 PM.\nI realized that not\neverybody is overweight.\nThere is an obesity crisis. Indeed.\nYou know,\nthe percentage of obesity\nand non-alcoholic fatty liver\ndisease is just cosmic through the roof,\nat least in this country and\nin other countries as well,\nthis country meaning the US\nbut other countries as well.\nBut there are of course,\npeople that are trying to gain\nweight through who don't want\nto lose weight or who are\ntrying to maximize physical\nperformance or hypertrophy\nor things of that sort.\nAnd so of course time-restricted\nfeeding for them might be\nas long as I'm awake, I'm eating.\nAnd I, you know, I tip my hat\nto those people and just say,\nyou know,\nprovided you understand what\nyou're doing and the burden\nthat,\nthat places on some of the\nother processes in your body,\nif that's right for you, then\nby all means pursue that.\nAnother thing that we can add\nto this summary or key points\nrelated to time restricted\nfeeding is the use of glucose,\ndisposal, agents, and or behaviors.\nIf you find that you've eaten\ntoo close to a period of time\nin which you would prefer to be fasting,\nthat's when a 30 minute brisk\nwalk or even modest walk after\neating can be beneficial,\ningesting some lemon juice\nor lime juice can help lower\nblood glucose somewhat.\nAnd then there are the things\nlike Metformin and berberine\nthere,\neven some supplements out\nthere that combine things like\nberberine cinnamon,\nwhich can lower blood glucose\nand things like chromium and\nthings that have a mild\neffect on blood glucose,\nbut berberine and Metformin\nare very high potency glucose\ndisposal agents.\nAnd I mentioned earlier why you\nwould want to approach those\nwith the appropriate level\nof caution and figure out the\ndosages for you, and, and for some people,\nthe dosages will be zero\nmilligrams is going to be ideal.\nAnd then of course we discussed\nhow making sure that you're\ningesting enough fluids in\nparticular water and salt,\nespecially if you're using\ncaffeine in order to increase\nyour levels of alertness,\nregardless of where that caffeine\nsource comes from coffee,\ntea, or otherwise,\nthat can cause the excretion\nof sodium and can lead to a\nkind of shakiness,\na lightheadedness and the\nfeelings of hunger that may or may\nnot be related to blood glucose.\nSome people genuinely need to eat.\nI certainly would not\nwant to see people getting\nhypoglycemic to the point\nwhere it's dangerous.\nCertainly if you are\ndiabetic, you, and in fact,\nfor all people,\nyou should consult with your\nphysician when exploring any\nmajor changes to diet or\nadditions or subtractions of\nanything, including supplementation,\nbut for most people maintaining\nrelatively low to modest\nblood glucose levels is going\nto be pretty healthy and will\nallow all the positive effects\nof intermittent fasting to\noccur.\nAnd when you find that reaching\nthat start to the feeding\nwindow is challenging that\ningesting sodium can often\nstabilize your system\nmentally and physically,\nand allow you to reach that\nwindow often painlessly.\nAnd then as a final point,\nas I mentioned earlier,\nprovided that they are consumed in low,\nno or modest amounts,\nartificial sweeteners,\nor plant-based non sugar,\nnon caloric sweeteners don't\nseem to really impact blood\nglucose to the extent that\nit would quote unquote,\ntake you out of your fast,\nbut that like fat fasting is\nsomething that's going to be\nhighly individual,\nand that you're going to\nhave to experiment with for\nyourself and being able to\nrecognize when you're in a fast\nand when you're out of a fast,\nat a subjective level and not\nconstantly having to measure\nyour blood glucose or do\nthings of that sort can be\nbeneficial.\nAnd I think if you watch for\nthe feelings associated with\neating and post eating foods\nof different kinds in different\namounts,\nand you watch for the feelings\nassociated with being fasted\nfor long periods of time or\nshort periods of time of having\ngotten sufficient sunlight\nof having trained harder,\nnot trained hard earlier\nthat day, et cetera,\nyou can do the most important thing,\nwhich is to start to learn,\nto evaluate your own system,\nto run simple,\nsafe experiments on your system\nin a way that allows you to\nreally establish the ideal\nnutrition schedule for you,\nwhether it be time restricted, feeding,\nAKA intermittent fasting, or\nsome other nutritional plan.\nIf you're learning from and\nor enjoying this podcast,\nplease subscribe to our YouTube\nchannel that really helps\nus.
