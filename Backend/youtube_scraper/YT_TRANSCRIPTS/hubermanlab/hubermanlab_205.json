    "transcript": "- Welcome to The Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[energetic rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday I have the pleasure of\nintroducing Dr. Craig Heller\nas my guest on The Huberman Lab Podcast.\nDr. Heller is a professor of biology\nand neurosciences at Stanford.\nHis laboratory works on a range of topics,\nincluding thermoregulation, down syndrome,\nand circadian rhythms.\nToday we talk about thermoregulation,\nhow the body heats and cools itself,\nand maintains what we call homeostasis,\nwhich is an equilibrium of processes\nthat keeps our neurons healthy,\nour organs functioning well.\nAnd as Dr. Heller teaches us,\nthermoregulation could\nbe leveraged in order\nto greatly increase our performance\nin athletics and mental\nperformance as well.\nLearning to control your\ncore body temperature\nis one of the most,\nif not the most powerful\nthing that you can do\nto optimize mental and\nphysical performance,\nregardless of the\nenvironment that you're in.\nHe also dispels many\ncommon myths about heating\nand cooling the body,\nincluding the idea that putting\na cold pack on your head\nor neck is the optimal\nway to cool down quickly.\nAnd in fact,\nas Dr Heller tells us, it\nactually can be counterproductive,\nand lead to hyperthermia.\nIt's a fascinating conversation\nfrom which I learned\na tremendous amount of new information,\nand we didn't even get into\nthe other incredibly interesting\nwork that Dr. Heller does\non down syndrome and\ncircadian rhythms and sleep.\nSo we hope to have him back in the future\nto discuss those topics.\nAs you'll soon see,\nDr. Heller is a wealth of knowledge\non all things human physiology,\nbiology, and human performance.\nIt's no surprise then that he's been chair\nof the biology department\nat Stanford for many years,\nas well as director of\nthe human biology program.\nSo if you're interested\nin human biology and how\nto improve your performance in any context\nor setting, athletic or otherwise,\nI think you'll very much\nenjoy today's conversation.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however,\npart of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost\nto consumer information about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system\nand I can tell you that the\nvisual system has to go through\na lot of work in order to main clarity\nof what you see when there are shadows,\nwhen you go into different\ntypes of indoor lighting,\nand so on,\nand a lot of glasses don't work\nwell because you put them on\nand then you're in bright\nlight and you can see fine,\nbut then you move into a\nshadow and then you have\nto take them off and they don't adjust,\nor they don't adjust quickly enough.\nWith ROKA, their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses are designed\nwith the visual system biology in mind.\nSo you always see things\nwith perfect clarity.\nThe glasses are also terrific,\nbecause they're very lightweight\nand they won't slip off your\nface if you're exercising,\nif you're running or biking.\nIn fact, they were\ndesigned for the purpose\nof being able to be worn\nwhile you're engaging in\nthose sorts of activities,\nor simply working at your desk.\nI happen to wear readers\nat night when I drive\nor when I work and I\nlove their sunglasses,\n'cause I can wear them anywhere.\nAnd also the aesthetics\nof their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses are terrific.\nUnlike a lot of other performance glasses\nthat frankly make people\nlook like cyborgs,\nthe aesthetics on ROKAs\nare really terrific.\nYou could wear them\nanywhere you'd like to go.\nIf you'd like to try RAOKA\nglasses, you can go to ROKA.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code HUBERMAN\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com.\nEnter the code HUBERMAN at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also analyze your\nDNA to see what you ought\nto be doing for your\nimmediate and longterm health.\nWe hear a lot these\ndays about optimization,\noptimizing hormones,\noptimizing your metabolism,\noptimizing this, optimizing that,\nbut unless you know the\nmeasurements of metabolic factors,\nhormones, and other things\nthat are in your blood and DNA,\nyou don't know what to optimize.\nWith InsideTracker, it\nmakes all of that very easy.\nThey can come to your house to\ntake the blood and DNA test,\nor you can go to a nearby clinic.\nThey send you the information\nand you take those results.\nAnd unlike a lot of laboratories\ndoing blood work out there\nand DNA tests, they\nhave a simple platform,\na dashboard that walks\nyou through your results\nand helps you identify what sorts\nof nutritional or\nbehavioral or other types\nof practices you might want\nto incorporate into your life\nin order to positively\nimpact your immediate\nand longterm health.\nIt's a very easy system to use,\nand you will gain a ton\nof information simply\nby doing that test,\nwhether or not you end up making changes\nto what you're doing or not.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any\nof InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at

delighted that they're\nsponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started using Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens once\nor twice a day is because it covers all\nof my nutritional bases.\nIn fact, if people asked\nme, and I often am asked,\nwhat supplements should I take?\nI always recommend Athletic Greens.\nAnd in fact, if you were to\ntake just one supplement,\nI recommend Athletic Greens\nfor the simple reason\nthat the vitamins,\nminerals, and probiotics,\nand adaptogens cover all\nyour nutritional bases.\nAnd the probiotics\noptimize gut-brain health,\nwhich we now know is essential for mood,\nfor immune system function,\nfor metabolic function.\nIt's just got so many\ngreat things in there.\nI really do feel better\nwhen I'm drinking my Athletic Greens.\nI mix mine up with some water,\na little bit of lemon juice.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nI'll drink it once or twice a day.\nIf I travel, I might even\ndrink it a third time,\njust because of the additional\nstress on my mind and body.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs.\nSo these little travel packs\nthat make it really easy\nto mix up athletic greens\nif you're on the plane or in the car.\nAnd they'll give you a year's\nsupply of vitamin D3K2.\nThere is now ample\nevidence that vitamin D3K2\nis supportive of the\nimmune system and a bunch\nof other biological functions\nand K2 has been shown\nto be important for cardiovascular health.\nSo again, if you go to\nathleticgreens.com/huberman,\nyou'll get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs\nand the year's supply\nof vitamin D3K2.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Craig Heller.\nGreat to have you here.\n- It's good to be here.\n- Yeah. It's been a long time coming.\nI know that I and many people have a lot\nof questions about the use of cold.\nSo one of the things that's\nhappened in recent years\nis that for many reasons,\npeople have become interested\nin things like taking cold showers\nand taking ice baths for\nmany different purposes.\nSometimes this is introduced\nas just a general health tonic,\nbut other times people\nget specific about how\nit can improve resilience\nor it can improve one's metabolism.\nCould you just tell me a little bit about\nwhat happens when I get into\na cold shower or an ice bath?\nWhat are some of the basic responses\nat the level of metabolism?\nObviously psychologically,\nwe don't know exactly.\nIt'll vary from person to person,\nbut what happens when I\nsubmerge myself into an ice bath\nif I've never done it before?\n- Well, first of all, you\nget a tremendous shock.\nAnd what that's going to translate into\nis a bit of a shot of adrenaline.\nAnd I think this is really\nthe so-called benefit,\nbut I wouldn't call it a\nbenefit, of the cryo chambers.\nYou go into a cryo\nchamber and it's a shock.\nSo you get a shot of adrenaline. So, sure.\nYou're going to feel\ndifferent when you come out.\nYou've had a shot of adrenaline.\nBut it doesn't necessarily\ntranslate into any benefit\nin terms of your physiology\nor performance, and so forth.\nNow if you take a cold\nbath or a cold shower,\na couple of things are happening.\nOne is you're going to\nstimulate vasoconstriction.\nSo if anything,\nit's going to make it a\nlittle bit more difficult\nfor your body to get rid of heat,\nbecause you're shutting off\nyour avenues of heat loss.\nIf you're in a true cold bath,\nthe overall surface area\nof your body is so great\nthat it doesn't matter if\nyou're vasoconstricted,\nyou're still going to lose heat.\n- Okay, so vasoconstriction,\nthe constriction of,\nis it capillaries, vessels\nand arteries all constrict\nor just one or two?\n- Well, this is an area of controversy.\nIn general, when people\ntalk of vasoconstriction,\nthey talk of the overall skin\nsurface, and that is not true.\nThe primary sites of heat loss,\nwhich we're going to get into,\nare the palms of your hands,\nthe soles of your feet, and\nthe upper part of your face.\nAnd the reason these are\navenues for heat loss\nis they're underlain by\nspecial blood vessels.\nAnd these blood vessels\nare able to shunt the blood\nfrom the arteries, which\nare coming from the heart,\ndirectly to the veins,\nwhich are returning to the heart,\nand bypassing the capillaries,\nwhich are the nutritive\nvessels, but high resistance.\nSo you can tell when\nyou shake someone's hand\nwhat his or her thermal status is.\nThe hand's hot or it's cold.\n- Do you think that's part of the reason\nwhy humans evolved this\npractice of shaking hands?\n[Craig chuckles]\nAssessing each other's level of anxiety?\nWe all know that a limp\nshake is pretty indicative\nof something and a firm handshake\nis indicatives of something,\nas is the crushing handshake\nfor that matter, right?\n- Yeah, I really don't know\nwhat the evolutionary origin\nof handshaking is, other\nthan to get your hand away\nfrom your weapon, [chuckles] perhaps.\n- Right, a couple of questions\nbefore we get into these\nspecialized vascular compartments\non the soles, the palms\nand the upper face.\nYou mentioned whole body immersion,\nlike into an ice bath or very\ncold water up to the neck\nversus a cold shower.\nIs there something fundamentally\ndifferent about those two,\nbesides the fact that they both provide\ntheir release of adrenaline?\nIs there anything that's really important\nto understand about the difference\nin the physiological response evoked\nby cold shower versus immersion in cold?\n- Well, there are differences\nthat are more physical\nthan anything else.\nSo if you are in a cold\nbath and you're still,\nyou develop a boundary layer.\nIf you're in a shower,\nyou can't develop a boundary layer.\n- Could you explain what\na boundary layer is?\n- Yes, it's best to explain it in terms\nof a hot bath, 'cause\neverybody's experienced that.\nYou get into a hot bath and, oh my God,\nit's really hot, almost painful.\nAnd then you sit down and\neventually it doesn't feel\nso hot anymore, because the still water,\nwhich is close to your skin,\nis coming into equilibrium with your skin.\nSo it's like having a blanket\non you or an insulator on you.\nAnd then if you move around,\nyou disturb that still water layer.\nYou feel the hot temperature again.\n- I see, so if I were to\nget into a cold ice bath\nor very cold body of water\nof some kind and stay still,\nI'd likely feel warmer at least until I-\n- You're not going to\nbe losing as much heat.\n- I see.\n- Right.\n- And then when I move in-\n- If you flail around,\nif you flail around, then\nyou're going to lose more heat.\n- Got it.\n- Yeah.\nBut I think getting back\nto your original question about benefits,\nyou have to keep in mind\nwhether you're talking\nabout aerobic activity\nor anaerobic activity,\nif you're referring to\nperformance and exercise,\nand so forth.\nSo if you're doing aerobic activity\nthat you can sustain for a long time,\nyour production of heat\nis rising gradually\nand is being distributed\nthroughout your body.\nSo eventually your body\ntemperature is going to come up\nto a level that's going to\nimpair your performance.\nSo the benefit of a cold\nbath or a cold shower\nbefore aerobic activity\nis that you increase\nthe capacity of your body mass\nto absorb that excess heat.\n- I see, so could you say that,\nin a rough sense, that a\nprotocol that one might use\nif they're going to\nhead out for a long run?\n- Yep.\n- Even on a reasonably\nwarm day, not super hot,\nor maybe it is super hot,\nwould be to take a cool\nshower before they go run.\nWould that be beneficial?\n- Sure, it'll take them longer to get\nto the sweat point and to heat up.\n- And what will that translate to in terms\nof a performance benefit?\n- Well, could increase your speed,\nor it depends on how you use that benefit.\nSome people are pacers.\nThey will go at the same pace\nand then they will go farther.\nOr some people are,\nI'm going to say pacers\nand regulators and, no, no.\nPacers or forcers.\nThey will take that\nadvantage and use it up\nas fast as they can.\nSo they will go faster, but\nnot necessarily farther.\n- I see, as far as I\nknow, not many athletes,\nat least not the ones that I know,\nare getting into cool bodies of water,\ntaking cold showers before\nthey head out to train.\nBut it sounds like there could be\na real performance benefit there.\n- It could be a benefit.\nI know we're going to\ntalk about our technology\nfor cooling, but at one point our,\nI don't know if they're using it now,\nbut our cross-country team,\nwhen they would go to\ncompete in a very hot place,\nthey would do their warm-up\nexercises, their stretching.\nThen they would extract heat\nbefore the beginning of the race.\nSo I like to think of it\nas you have greater scope\nfor heat absorption.\n- Interesting, about\nhow long would one need\nto take one of these showers\nor cold immersions before\nheading out for a run?\nRoughly speaking, we don't\nhave to get into details,\nbecause everyone's performance level\nand regimen is going to be different,\nwhere they live is going\nto be different, et cetera.\n- It's not as long as\nyou think. It's minutes.\n- Couple minutes?\n- Yeah.\nBecause what's going to happen is\nas your core temperature goes down,\nyou will eventually\nshut off your heat loss.\nAnd that keeps it from going below normal.\nSo if you've warmed up\nand your temperature\nhas risen by half a degree,\nlet's say, it doesn't take\nmore than a few minutes\nto extract that heat\nif you're vasodilated.\n- Interesting, and what about\nfor the anaerobic athlete?\nThe strength athlete.\n- Right.\nFor the anaerobic athlete,\nand let's say\nthey're doing several\nsets and how many reps,\nwhatever they're doing,\ntheir core temperature's\nnot going to rise that fast,\nbecause it's only certain\nmuscles which are being used,\nbut the temperature of\nthose muscles will go up.\n- So it's a local effect.\n- It's a local effect, right.\n- Okay.\nSo let's say, for sake of today,\nmaybe for this discussion,\nif we assume that the basic workout,\neven though people do variation on this is\n5 sets of 5 or 10 sets of 10.\nSo for those listening,\nit would be 5 sets of\n10 of 5 rep repetitions,\nor 10 sets of 10 repetitions,\n10 by 10, 5 by 5.\nYeah, so if somebody, let's say,\nis doing a large body compound movement,\nlike barbell squats where\nthere are a lot of large body movements,\nhip hinging, et cetera.\nBut for instance,\nthe biceps are not, they're involved,\nbut more or less indirectly.\n- Right.\n- So the effect is going to\nbe to heat up the quadriceps,\nheat up the hamstrings,\nheat up the glutes,\nthis kind of thing.\n- Right.\n- I see.\n- And then during rest, that\nheat will leave the muscle,\nbut it's not fast.\nAnd certainly the heat can't\nleave the muscle very fast\nwhile you're working out, because\nwhen the muscle contracts,\nit squeezes the blood vessels.\nAnd the only way heat gets out\nof a muscle is in the blood.\nAnd your muscle metabolism can go up 50\nor 60-fold during anaerobic activity.\nThat means the heat production\nin the muscle goes up 50\nor 60-fold.\nThe blood flow to that\nmuscle cannot go up 50\nor 60-fold.\nSo you literally have the\ncapacity to cook your muscles.\n[Craig chuckles]\n- So this is probably an appropriate time\nto just mention briefly what\nthe underlying mechanism\nof this is.\nWe will return to the\nspecifics of what one can do\nto mitigate this heating up,\nbut could you just\nexplain the relationship\nbetween energy production ATP\nand pyruvate kinase and\nthe role of heat there?\n- Sure. We don't get\nsomething for nothing.\nSo like a steam engine,\nmost of the energy in\nour food is lost as heat.\nSo we are roughly about 20% efficient.\nSo of the energy that\nwe take in in our food,\nabout 20% of that can go into doing work,\nand the rest of it is lost as heat.\nNow we're mammals.\nWe use that heat to keep our\nbody temperature considerably\nabove the environment.\nBut if you raise body\ntemperature a few degrees higher,\nyou're in trouble, that's hyperthermia.\nSo individual muscles can\nreach hyperthermic limits\nbefore you might experience\nit in the whole body.\nSo to keep you from damaging\nyour muscle by hyperthermia,\nwe have fail-safe mechanisms.\nAnd one of those fail-safe\nmechanisms is an enzyme\nwhich is critical for getting fuel.\nIn other words, the results\nof metabolism of glucose,\ngetting that fuel into the mitochondria,\nwhich is making our major coinage\nof energy exchange, ATP, okay?\nSo that particular enzyme\nis temperature-sensitive.\nSo when the muscle temperature\ngets above 39 or 39.5,\nit shuts off.\nAnd that essentially\nshuts off the fuel supply\nto the mitochondria.\nThat's when you cannot do one more rep.\n- So failure, could we say that-\n- Muscle failure.\n- One component of muscular failure\nis overheating of the muscle locally?\n- Right.\n- There're probably\nother things too.\n- Well, if you, yeah, if you lack oxygen,\nbut our oxygen delivery is pretty good\nto the muscle.\nIf you run out of glucose, yeah.\nThat's going to impair you.\nBut the most immediate,\nthe most immediate impairment\nof muscle activity,\nmuscle fatigue, in other words,\nis the rise in temperature of the muscle.\n- Interesting, I want to talk about how\nthat muscle fails locally,\nbut I have this burning\nquestion in my mind\nthat I cannot seem to answer for myself.\nI'm hoping you can answer it for me.\nSo let's say I'm doing five\nsets of five with squats.\nI hit fit muscular\nfailure at a given weight.\nAnd according to what I now know,\nit's my quadriceps and\nthe muscles associated,\nI mean, with the squat that have failed\nbecause of this heat triggering,\nthis mechanism triggered by\nheat that shuts off the muscle.\nBut my biceps are nice and\ncool, you're telling me.\nThey're not doing too much\nwork. It's only indirect work.\nSo why is it that I can't set\nthe bar down in the squat rack,\nwalk over and do barbell curls\nwith the same intensity that I could\nif I were to do those barbell curls fresh,\nnot having done anything prior?\n- Well, you will still\nhave a fatigue curve\nwith your upper body, okay?\nAnd that will be influenced by any rise\nin temperature that has been generated\nby your lower body exercise.\n- So temperature in both\ncases is the limiting factor?\n- It's one limiting factor.\nIt's one limiting factor.\n- I find that amazing.\nI find that amazing because\nI always thought naively\nthat the reason muscles fail\nis because, quote, don't have the strength\nto do another repetition.\nThat you lack glycogen or some ability\nto access that glycogen.\nBut of course, we still have glycogen.\nIt's naive for me to think that,\nbecause if I wait three\nminutes and go back,\nI can do those repetitions again.\nSo the glycogen wasn't\nrestored in that three minutes,\nobviously it was there.\n- Right.\n- So I realized there might\nbe other mechanisms involved.\nSounds like heat is, if\nnot the dominant mechanism\nthat prevents more work.\nIt's one of them.\n- It's one of them. And it's a quick one.\nIt's a fast one.\nSo it can happen with,\nlet's say you are a really\nexperienced weightlifter, okay?\nYou may be doing very,\nvery high weights with\nsets of five or six.\n- Yeah, to be clear for the audience,\nI'm not doing very high weights\nfor sets of five. [chuckles]\n[Craig laughs]\nI'm not particularly strong.\nI'm not super weak,\nbut I'm not particularly strong,\nbut Craig's referring, in\nthe general sense, to you.\nSo why is it that if I\nfinish a set of squats,\nI can't simply cool off\nmy quadriceps by throwing\na nice cool towel on my quadriceps.\nWhy is that not the\nbest way to go about it?\n- Because your body surface\nis a very good insulator.\nOkay, we think we don't have fur,\nand therefore we're not insulated,\nbut the skin, the fascia,\nthe muscles underneath,\nthey're all very good insulators.\nAnd that's why I said earlier\nthat the way the heat gets out\nof the muscle is in the blood.\n- So I want to step through\na couple other portals\nby which one might think that heating\nand cooling would be ideal.\nAnd then get back to these.\n- Sure.\n- Specialized surfaces on the\nhands, the feet and the face.\n- [Craig] Yeah.\n- So if throwing a cold towel or\neven ice cold towel on my quadriceps\nisn't going to work or\nstanding in front of the fan,\nbecause I'm insulated from that cool,\nI can't cool off my blood fast enough.\nWhat about drinking 16\nounces of ice water?\n- Sure. You can do that.\nBut you can calculate how much\nheat that can absorb, okay?\nAnd you can't continue\ndrinking liters of ice water.\nYou're going to dilute your\nblood and have other problems.\nBut yes, it'll help. Sure, it will help.\nBut it doesn't have the\nfull capacity you will need.\n- What about an ice pack\nto the back of my neck\nor to my head or squeezing\nthe cold sponge over the head?\nI'm deliberately moving\nthrough these options,\nbecause these are the ones\nthat we see most often.\nWe were actually just\nwatching the Olympic track\nand field trials last night up in Oregon.\nI'm a huge track and field fan.\nAnd there were a lot\nof sponges on the backs\nof necks before, in\nbetween, and after events.\nAnd how good is that\nor how poor is that as a strategy?\nSince now we know that\nbeing overheated locally\nand systemically throughout the body\nis a serious limiting\nfactor on performance.\n- Well, you have to understand something\nabout our thermoregulatory system.\nWe have a thermostat\njust like you have a\nthermostat in your house.\nAnd that thermostat is in the brain, okay?\n- Do we know the specific site?\n- Yes.\n- Yes.\n- It's called the preoptic\ninterior hypothalamus.\nIt does many things in terms\nof physiological regulation,\nbut it serves as a thermostat.\nNow that thermostat has\nto have information.\nIt has to have input. Where\ndoes that input come from?\nIt comes from our overall body surface\nwhere we sense temperature, okay?\nSo one of the things that can\nhappen when you're overheated\nis that you can send in a cold\nstimulus to your thermostat\nand that sort of like wanting\nto cool your house by putting\na wet washcloth over your thermostat,\nit's doing the wrong thing.\nSo we've actually had experiences\nwhere we've had people exercising,\ngetting overheated, and then\ncooling the body surface,\nand they say it feels great.\nThis is fantastic. And their\ncore temperature is going up.\n- Well, I think this is\nsuch an important point.\nFirst of all, I was weaned in a laboratory\nwhere there were always\nbattles over the temperature\nin the lab.\nSo people were always putting\nice packs on thermostats\nor putting fans towards thermostats\nand trying to play this game.\nGood to know we were all being foolish,\neven though we were neurobiologists.\nPutting a cold towel over\nmy torso or putting ice\non the back of my upper back,\nyou're saying could\nactually heat up my core?\n- It'll at least decrease your heat loss,\nyour rate of heat loss as\nyou're going to raise the\nissue a little later, I know,\nand that is our natural\nportals for heat loss.\nSo you can think of the natural portals\nfor heat loss as our\nair conditioners, okay?\nThe thermostats in the\nbrain and the information\nto the thermostat is coming\nfrom the overall body surface.\nSo what can happen if you, let's say,\ncool the torso with an ice vest,\nyou can actually cause\nvasoconstriction of your portals,\nyour heat loss portals.\nSo that's what impairs the rate\nat which you're losing heat.\nIt feels good.\nNow back to the head,\nthat's really interesting.\nThe major blood flow to the brain comes up\nfour arteries through the neck.\nThere's the carotid arteries\nand there's the vertebral arteries.\nSo when you put a cold\ntowel around the neck,\nyou're going to be putting a\ncold stimulus into the brain.\nAnd that's great for protecting the brain.\nYou want to protect the brain,\nbut it's also going to make\nyou feel cooler than you are.\nSo you will think you're\nready to go again quickly\nwhen you've just essentially\ncooled the thermostat.\n- This is an important point.\nAnd there's a lot of interest nowadays,\nand people doing marathons,\nand even some people do\nthese ultras, ultra running,\nwhich I guess is everything\nlonger than a marathon.\nAnd last man standing, last man,\nlast woman standing kind of things.\nSo you're saying that if\nsomebody's hyperthermic,\nthey could trick themselves\ninto subjectively thinking\nthat they are cooling\noff by putting a towel\nand that they can go further,\nbut their brain could cook?\n- Well, if they stop the cooling,\nthen that hot blood from the body core\nis going to go to the brain.\n- Interesting, well,\nit's a bit of a tangent,\nbut many people report after\nlong bouts of exercise,\nor even just very intense\nbouts of exercise,\nfeeling a kind of brain\nfog or mental fatigue.\nI assumed that that was due\nto lowered brain\noxygenation post-exercise,\nbut is it possible that there\nis some post-exercise effects\non heating and cooling of the brain\nthat might impact cognition,\nor I should say negatively\nimpact cognition?\n- It's certainly possible\nbecause we know that\nrise in temperature\ndecreases cognitive capacity.\nI mean, you can experience that yourself.\nYou can get on a treadmill,\nand follow your temperature,\nand then just do a simple activity\nlike adding and subtracting.\nYou get to about 39 degrees,\nyou can't do that anymore.\nYou can't just calculate\nhow long you've been on the treadmill.\n- So the phrase cool,\ncalm and collected is-\n- Cool, calm and collected.\n- That's the goal\nin all pursuits.\n- That's right.\n- So I want to talk about these portals,\nbecause you've mentioned them a few times.\nBefore I ask about what\nthe portals are exactly\nand how they work\nand how they can be\nleveraged for performance,\nthere's a question that\nmy neurobiologist self\ncan't resist, but ask.\nWe have this thermostat\nin the preoptic area\nof the hypothalamus,\nwhich is interesting to me,\nthe medial preoptic area\nis also one that's known\nto be sexually dimorphic,\ndepending on testosterone\nexposure early in life,\nor et cetera.\nAlthough people should just note that\nit's not actually testosterone\nthat creates these sexual\ndimorphism, these differences.\nActually testosterone\nconverted into estrogen.\nIt's actually estrogen is the effector,\nwhich is fascinating.\nNonetheless, we've got this\narea that acts as a thermostat.\nAnd you said it's collecting information\nfrom the whole body.\nDoes that mean that there are pathways,\nas the neuroscientists like\nyou and I refer to them,\nas these afferent or input\npathways from the body\nto the preoptic area,\nis there a map of our\nbody in the preoptic area?\n'Cause I have to imagine\nthat you can't have\nthe information just coming\nfrom the left shoulder,\njust from the right toe.\nIt sounds like you need a pretty,\nprobably a pretty crude map,\nbut that you need a complete\nmap of the body surface there.\n- Well, you don't need a\ncomplete map in the hypothalamus.\nI mean, that thermal afferent information\nthat you've mentioned,\nit also goes to the somatosensory cortex.\nSo you know if an ice cube\nhas touched you on the back,\nbut that doesn't necessarily\ntranslate into a change in,\nlet's say you're shivering or sweating.\nSo the information that's\ngoing to the hypothalamus\nis more integrated representation\nof body temperature.\n- So it's sort of an average of\nwhat's happening-\n- It's an average.\n- Across the body.\nSo if I were to, let's\nsay I get hot on a hot day\nand Popsicles, when we\nwere in summer camp,\nI went to a sports camp\nnear here actually,\nand we'd run around like crazy.\nAnd then we'd get into\nthe shade if we could,\nbut we were, Popsicles.\nIt was all about Popsicles.\n- Brain freeze.\n- Or the kids were putting ice cubes\ndown each other's shirts or something.\nBut that's an average,\nbecause other parts of\nthe body aren't exposed,\nthe mouth is exposed to the\nice in the Popsicle case\nor the cold cubes are in the hands.\nAs you said, it feels really good.\n- It feels good. Yeah.\n- But it sounds like it\nfeels deceptively good,\nbecause in reality could still\nbe quite warm internally.\n- Absolutely. Yeah.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah.\nYou can feel great and have\na dangerously hyperthermic temperature,\nbut I should say that when\nyou get into the danger zone,\nthings get bad fast.\n- What are some of the\nsymptoms that people could be\non the lookout for for hyperthermia?\n- Essentially, it's almost ironic that\nif individuals are\ntransitioning into heat stroke,\nthey actually vasoconstrict\nand they stop sweating.\nAnd that's a pathological situation.\nI couldn't begin to explain it.\nBut essentially you are\njust feeling exhausted.\nYou're feeling miserable.\nThe heart rate is very high.\nYour heart rate goes up as\nyour core temperature goes up,\ncalled cardiac drift.\nSo you just feel rotten.\nBut that's why since\nit's not a danger signal that\nyou can translate immediately\ninto, oop, I'm going into heat stroke,\nthat's why people can\novercome their bad feeling\nwith motivation to continue\ngoing, to work harder.\nSo there've been a number of\nhigh profile athletic deaths\ndue to heat stroke that\nwere during practice.\nNot in competition when people\nare really trying to do it,\nbut in practice,\nwhich shows they were\njust motivated to push.\n- So let's talk about\nthese magnificent portals\nthat not just humans,\nbut other animals,\nmammals are equipped with.\nSo if putting cold on\nthe neck or on the head\nor on the torso is not optimal,\nwhat is optimal?\nAnd maybe walk us through a theory as\nto why we would have these\nportals located where they are.\nAnd then we can talk about how one\nmight leverage them for performance.\n- Okay, where the portals\nare, are in the glabrous skin,\nbig word, okay?\nGlabrous just means no hair.\nSo it's the hairless skin.\nYou say, well,\nmost of my body is without hair.\nNo, most of your body has hair follicles.\nWe are mammals, mammals have fur.\nWe've lost the fur,\nbut we still have that\nhairy skin phenotype\nall over our body, except,\nexcept for those skin surfaces\nwhere our mammal\nrelatives didn't have fur.\nSo the pads of the feet.\nAnd for the primates,\nupper part of the face.\nFor rabbits, no portions of the ears,\nthe inner surfaces of the ears-\n- Ah, never thought about that.\nFor bears, the tongue.\nBears have big tongues,\nhuge tongues. [chuckles]\n- I didn't know that either.\nI haven't been that close to a bear yet.\n- Haven't had a leaking match with a bear.\n- Not yet. No.\n- So anyway, our mammalian\nrelatives can't lose heat\nover their overall body surface.\nSo probably very early on\nin mammalian evolution,\nthey evolved these special blood vessels\nin the limited surface\nareas that don't have fur.\nAnd as I said, what\nthese blood vessels are\nare shunts between the\narteries and the veins.\nArteries and veins are both\nlow resistance vessels.\nSo you can have high flow rate.\nCapillaries, which normally\nare between arteries\nand veins are high resistance\nbecause they're very tiny, okay?\n- Is it fair to say that\nwhat I was taught is that blood flows\nfrom arteries, then to capillaries,\nand then to veins, and\nthen back to the heart.\nSo it's sort of like from\nthe heart through arteries,\nthen through these little capillaries,\nwhich are like little\nestuaries and streams and then\nto the veins, back to the heart.\nIs that generally true?\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- Okay, so what I learned in\nbasic physiology is still?\n- Is still-\n- I wouldn't get an F in your class?\n- No.\n- Maybe a D or C,\nbut not F.\n- So that's excellent.\n- Okay.\nAnd so you're saying that in this glabrous\nor beneath the glabrous skin.\n- There are these shunts.\n- And those go directly\nfrom arteries to veins?\nSo you skip the\ncapillaries-\n- Capillaries, yep.\n- And is it actually,\nas long as I'm, say that in the skin,\nwhen I feel the pads of my hands,\nhow deep to the surface\ndo these vessels reside?\n- They're below the,\nobviously the epidermis.\nSo if you are warm and you look\nat the palms of your hands,\nthey are fairly red and the\nbacks of your hands aren't.\nYou don't have these vessels\nin the backs of your hands.\nNow if you take a glass,\nlike a water tumbler, right?\nAnd you grab it, you can see\nif you squeeze a little bit,\nthe hand goes white.\nThat's because you've\nshut off that blood flow.\n- Oh, interesting. I'm going to\ndo that little home experiment.\n- So if you're bicycling on a hot day,\nyou don't want to to be grabbing\nyour handlebars all the time.\nYou want to periodically. [chuckles]\n- Well, this is important.\nI know you're privy to\nsome really amazing results\nthat we're going to talk about,\nbut I actually heard you say this\nduring this lecture\nrecently that Stanford held\nabout human performance\nthat we were both part of.\nAnd you mentioned this,\nthat if you're cycling\nand you're working hard\nand you want to be able to do more work,\nwe now know why you want to\nremain cool in order to continue\nto do work, and if you get too warm,\nthat's bad, that gripping\nthe handlebars too tightly\nwill actually limit your performance.\n- Right.\n- And that's probably\nalso true on the Peloton\nor any other kind of device or the skier\nor anything like that.\n- Right.\n- So loosen the grip,\nor if you safely can,\nyou want to actually expose\nyour hands to the world?\nNow what about for people wearing gloves?\nWhat about the,\nto me that just seems crazy based\non everything you're telling me.\n- Well, gloves definitely\nimpede heat loss from the hands,\njust as socks impede heat\nloss from the feet, okay?\nSo if you want to maximize your heat loss,\nyou want to have as thinner\nprotectors as possible\non your hands.\nAnd of course the feet\nare more problematical,\nbecause you have to be\nusing them in certain ways.\n- Some people run barefoot.\n- Yeah. Well, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nThat's become somewhat popular.\nIt seems like it kind of came and went.\nThey had those toe shoes things,\nbut they looked so ridiculous\nthat I think most people\njust were willing to take\nthe performance hindrance\nof regular shoes.\n- Actually we had a track\ncoach here at Stanford\nwho for a while was famous\nfor introducing training\nwithout shoes, running.\n- Interesting.\n- And he thought it was\nbecause it changed the posture\nof the runner.\nAnd I think it was just due to the fact\nthat he was increasing the capacity\nof his runners to lose heat.\n- Interesting, yeah, so heating up\nat the level of the hands obviously\nis going to hinder performance.\nSo how about with running?\nI noticed, I ran cross country\nbriefly in high school,\nand not particularly well at that,\nbut that we were told to run as\nif we were holding crackers\nin our fingers or something\nlike very lightly,\nand to keep hands kind of loose.\nSo running like this would actually\nbe more beneficial performance\nthan, or gripping a phone,\nwhich is probably what most people\nare doing nowadays, right?\n- Right.\n- Interesting and-\n- Once, I'll tell you a\nexperience I had once.\nI was in Alaska\nin the winter and I went out running\nand I absentmindedly forgot gloves.\nAnd I realized this after\na short period running,\nbecause the backs of my hands\nwere aching from the cold,\nthe palms of my hands were\nsweating and were hot.\n- Oh, amazing. Amazing.\nSo these compartments are a real thing.\nAnd you mentioned the\nupper half of the face-\n- The upper part, that's\nwhere our primate ancestors\ndon't have fur.\n- And the bottoms of our feet.\nSo let's just take a\nmoment and talk about some\nof the more amazing results\nthat have been associated\nwith proper cooling of these\nglabrous skin surfaces.\n- Let me introduce one more thing.\n- Sure.\n- Because you asked earlier\nabout the pouring of\nwater on the head, okay?\nOne of the things which\nis not appreciated fully\nis that the blood\nwhich is perfusing these\nspecial blood vessels\nin the face above the beard line,\nthat's the non-hairy skin,\nthat blood then returns in the\nvenous supply to the heart,\nbut it actually does it\nin a very strange way.\nIt actually goes through what are called,\nI'm blocking on the name now.\n- Take your time.\n- These are blood vessels that\ngo through the skull, okay?\nAnd that's why the scalp bleeds a lot\nif you cut the scalp.\nAnd these blood vessels which are called,\nI want to say emergent,\nbut it's not emergent.\nIt's a word that means leaving.\nThese blood vessels were primarily thought\nto be ways that blood\nis leaving the brain.\nBut when you're overheated,\nthe direction of flow in\nthose blood vessels reverses.\nSo the cool blood that's coming\nfrom your facial region goes\ninto that circulation and actually\nis a cooling source for the brain.\nSo you can cool the brain.\nYou can have a cooling effect on the brain\nby pouring water on your head.\n- Interesting, so that practice,\nwhich we, at least for me,\nI most commonly associate\nwith combat sports,\nwhere the fighter goes to their corner.\nThey usually sit down on a stool,\nunless they're trying to\ndo some mental warfare\nfrom the corner, in which case,\nthey don't even take a seat.\nAnd their corner crew\nwill squeeze a glove, excuse me,\na sponge full of cold water over them,\nthat you're saying is somewhat effective\nin cooling the brain?\n- Yeah, it's one of the natural mechanisms\nfor cooling the brain.\n- I want to return to this\nat some point as well,\nbut is there any known\nbenefit to cooling the brain\nin terms of offsetting physical damage,\noffsetting the negative\neffects of concussion.\nBecause one of the reasons why fighters\nwill often get, on the back,\na cold item on the back of the neck\nor on the head is not\njust to cool them down,\nbut the theory is that\nit might offset some\nof the damage of neurons.\n- I just can't comment on that.\nI'm aware of those ideas,\nbut they're controversial.\nOne of the things that\nyou want to do for injury\nto the brain is to decrease swelling.\nAnd one of the ways that\nyou decrease swelling\nin many parts of the body is to cool.\nIt decreases inflammation.\nIt decreases the blood flow.\nSo I think it's a really interesting topic\nand it's something that\nshould be investigated.\nIt's kind of hard to investigate.\n- Yeah, interesting. Okay.\nSo I hear these stories.\nAnd I've seen the data.\nSo I believe the stories.\nMaybe tell us a story about\nan observation that your group\nhas made with respect\nto anaerobic exercise\nand proper cooling of\nthese glabrous surfaces.\nAnd we can talk about the technology.\nMaybe give us the dips example first.\n- Okay.\n- So of course,\nI think most people\nare familiar with dips.\nYou're supposed to, I guess-\n- Raise and lower your body.\n- Yeah, raise and lower your body,\nraise and lower your body mass usually\nwith your legs dangling down.\nSometimes people strong enough\nto attach a weight there\nand they'll do, it's essentially\na compound upper body exercise.\n- Right.\n- One dip would not be\nparticularly impressive\nfor most people.\n100 would be very impressive.\n20 would be impressive\nfor some, et cetera.\nWhat happens when a skilled\nathlete comes in and does dips\nfor multiple sets.\nAnd then what happens when\nthey cool properly using\nthe glabrous skin surface?\n- This was a story that occurred early on\nin our investigations\nwhen we first made the\ndiscoveries that cooling has\na benefit to increase your work volume,\nyour capacity to do more reps, okay?\nSo the word got over, I think,\nto the 49ers camp.\nAnd one of their players, Greg Clark,\nwho was a tight end at the time.\nHe had been tight end at Stanford.\nHe decided, or I don't\nknow if he was asked,\nor what, to come over and check it out.\nSo Greg came over and we said,\n\"Greg, what are you good at?\nWhat activity do you like to do?\"\nHe said, \"Dips.\nI can do a lot of dips.\nI can do 40 dips in a first set.\nAnd I can probably do five sets.\nThat's a usual workout for me.\"\nAnd we said okay.\nSo he came over to the gym one day\nand that's exactly what he did.\nHe did 40 dips the first set,\nand then maybe 25 and 15 and down, down-\n- Do you recall roughly what kind\nof rest periods he was\ntaking between sets?\n- Yeah, we standardized the\nrest period to three minutes,\nbecause that's what we had set\non for cooling as the injure-\n- That's a good long rest period.\n- Yeah. It is.\n- It's still a lot dips.\n- Yeah, it's actually a longer rest period\nthan many people would\nprefer during workouts.\nThey want to make the most of the time-\n- Not me. I prefer to take as much rest\nas I possibly can, yeah.\n- So several days later he\ncame back and his first set,\nhe did, I think, maybe\n42, a little bit better,\nbut now people were standing\naround and watching.\nSo there was a little\nimpetus there to show off.\nSo then his second set was,\nI don't remember the numbers,\nbut very much above the\nsecond set on the control day.\nThis was after we cooled his-\n- Okay, so when is he doing the cooling?\n- He's sitting down and putting his hands\nin the devices that we had built,\nwhich were cooling the palms of hands.\n- For how long does that cooling take?\nCan he do it inside of a\nthree-minute rest period?\n- Yeah, that's what we were doing.\nWe standardized the interval\nfor resting or cooling\nto three minutes, okay.\nBut the point is he got to his fifth set\nand all of the sets were above\nwhat he had done on the previous day.\nAnd he said, \"I'm not tired.\nI can do another set.\"\nAnd then I can do another set.\nI can do another set.\nI can do another set.\nSo from one day to two or\nthree days later with cooling,\nhe doubled the total work volume.\nHe doubled the total number of dips.\n- By adding more sets and\nmore repetitions to each set?\n- Right, so then he kept coming\nback for four more weeks,\ntwice a week.\nAnd by the end of that month,\nhe was doing 300 dips.\n- Wow. So what percent-\n- So he tripled.\n- He tripled.\n- Tripled, and so here\nis a professional athlete\nat peak physical conditioning,\nand he triples what he can do.\n- Amazing, and in terms\nof his ability to recover,\nwas that explored or discussed at all?\nBecause my understanding is\nthat if we cause enough stress\nto a muscle during anaerobic training,\nwe provide the stimulus\nfor compensatory regrowth,\net cetera, but if we do more work,\nwe essentially scale up\nthe amount of recovery\nthat's needed or the recovery time.\nI'm very curious about whether\nor not he needed longer\nto recover between these\nsuper-performing workouts?\n- That's very interesting.\nThat was a major discovery,\nwhich we didn't realize we\nwere making at the time.\nThere is this phenomenon\nyou're referring to\nas delayed onset muscle soreness, DOMS.\nAnd this is due to those little\nmicro tares, and so forth,\nthat are happening as we extend\nour workout capacity volume, okay?\nSo we've had this experience\nso many times that an athlete\nor anyone will come in to\nthe lab and they will exceed\nwhat their previous goals were,\ntheir previous expectations.\nAnd I can always see the words\ncoming out of their mouth,\n\"I'm going to be so sore tomorrow.\"\nThey never are.\n- Interesting.\n- And we've actually demonstrated\nthat with a naive group.\nWe had a class, a physical\nconditioning class.\nAnd we had half of the, the\nfirst days of the class,\nwe had to establish their true\ncapacity, what they could do.\nSo these were pretty heavy\nworkouts for these new recruits.\nAnd we gave half of them the benefit\nof cooling and the other half not.\nAnd then we had them record\ntheir subjective levels\nof delayed onset muscle soreness.\nAnd those that were cool,\ndidn't have significant muscle soreness.\n- Amazing, and I know there\nare also published results,\nand we will provide links to some\nof these papers for people\nseeing similar effects,\nI should say, similar\nperformance enhancing effects,\nusing bench presses, the\nbench press, or pushups,\nor other sorts of things.\nMaybe you could give us\nan example from the realm\nof endurance work or aerobic\nwork, running, cycling,\nthings of that sort.\n- Well, one of the problems with,\nfor us, is that our equipment\nnow is not really portable.\nI mean, it's portable in\nthe sense that you can carry\nit to the gym or to the football field.\n- But you're not going\nto run or run with it.\n- But you're not going\nto run with it, right.\n- Or equip a bicycle with it.\nAlthough when are the cooling\nhandles on bicycles coming?\n- That would be good,\nbut one itinerant activity is golfing.\nAnd people have put it\non their golf carts, and-\n- Do people really heat\nup that much in golf?\n- They do.\n- Not to be disparaging of the golfers,\nbut the way I conceptualize golf,\nit's like a swing and then a walk\nand then a cart ride and then a meal.\nI probably just offended\nall the golfers out there.\n- Well, one time we were doing work\nfor the Department of Defense.\nAnd they wanted to check it out,\nwhether or not what we were\ndoing was really worthwhile.\nSo they sent out a team of\nspecial ops soldiers to be\nour subjects and test it out.\nThey were here for a week.\nSo they that was a fun week.\n- Yeah, I do some work with those guys.\nThey're hard driving guys.\nThey also know how to have fun.\nBut yeah, they definitely have,\nif they have an off or a quit switch,\nit's buried deep within\ntheir nervous system.\nThey don't like to hit that quit switch.\n- So the guy who wrote the final report,\nhe gave an addendum to the\nreport and he said, \"Well,\nI'll tell you this.\nAfter I've gotten home,\nit's added that technology,\"\nthey took the technology with them.\nThey wanted to keep it.\n- Oh, Yeah.\nThat sounds about right.\n- And using it, it has added 20 yards\nto every club in my bag.\nAnd that's no effin' small deal.\n- Wow, so it's allowing\npeople to hit further,\nhit their golf ball further?\n- Right. [chuckles]\n- Interesting. All right.\nSo for the golf players out there,\nthat's the reward you get back from Craig\nfor all my little knocks on golf.\nI don't have any knock on golf.\nI just don't think about it\nas a sport where heating up\nis a limiting factor.\nSo since they're getting\nmore out of their drive,\nwhat do you think's going on there?\n- Well, they can be heating up.\n- And they wear gloves, right?\n- They're wearing glove on\na hot day, and so forth.\nBut let me just tell you\none more serious story\nabout golfers and that is individuals\nwith multiple sclerosis\nare exceedingly temperature-sensitive.\n- I didn't know that.\n- So they may still be mobile,\nbut they have to stay in cool locations\nand not increase their\nexercise to any great extent.\nBut we've had subjects\nwith multiple sclerosis\nwho have just essentially put the device\non their golf cart and\nthey're back out playing golf\nin the middle of the summer.\n- Oh, that's great.\n- Yeah.\n- That's great.\nAnything that allows people\nto have normal levels of\nlivelihood and recreation is great.\nWe always think about performance\nat these kinds of like\npeak and elite levels\nand pushing harder, but yeah,\nanything that allows people\nto be mobile and functional is great.\nSo what's your favorite\nexample of endurance,\nand feel free to give us the extreme one\nand then we'll talk about averages\nto make sure we're thorough\nabout averages versus exceptions.\n- Right. We haven't\ndone a lot in the field.\nI mean outdoors.\nMost of our endurance\nhas been in a hot room\nwith treadmill work, and so forth.\nSo the very first experiment we had,\nI think, maybe 18 subjects\njust off the street.\nMaybe we just recruited\npeople in the hallways,\ncome on in and do this.\nAnd what we found is we could,\nfor this group with one trial\nwith and without cooling,\nwe could double their endurance,\nwalking on the treadmill,\nwalking uphill on the\ntreadmill in the heat,\nlike maybe 40 degrees ambient temperature,\n40 degrees centigrade.\n- So what does the experiment look like?\nYou're having people walk on\nan incline. It's really warm.\nSome people are just going to\nhit the quit button and say,\nI've had enough and get off the treadmill\nwith proper cooling.\nWhen are they doing the cooling?\n- They're doing it continuously.\n- I see.\n- Because in the laboratory,\nwe can suspend devices from\nthe ceiling, for example.\nNow we do have prototype wearable devices.\nWe did them in response to\nemails from Ebola workers\na number of years ago in Sierra Leone.\nThey said, \"We've read about\nyour work with athletes.\nCan't you do something for us?\nI mean, we're in the\npersonal protective gear,\nand we can't be in the\nhot zone for more than 15\nor 20 minutes.\"\nSo that was started us on the challenge\nof developing wearable systems\nthat could go under the PPE.\nWe've published that work now, but-.\n- That's great, and I'm guessing\nthe military special operators\nthat are out in the desert\nand other locations are probably excited\nabout this technology.\n- Well, once they get it.\n- Once they get.\nIt's coming, it's coming.\nYeah, I think some people might wonder,\nif there are all these studies\nand there are these incredible\nresults over the years\non why haven't we heard more about it?\nAnd I will ask your\nopinion on that as well.\nBut I'll just editorialize a little bit.\nIs that the best laboratory work\nin its practical applications\noftentimes requires many studies.\nAnd oftentimes there isn't\na portal, so to speak,\nto get that information out\ninto the technology sector.\nSo there is a company that's\ndeveloping this technology\nfor people to use, to purchase and use.\nYou might as well just tell us now,\nwhat is the name of that company?\nAnd do they have a website?\nPeople are going to want to know\nwhere can they get this\nmagical technology?\nAnd is there a poor man's\nversion of it as well?\n- Well, the company is\nArteria, A-R-T-E-R-I-A,\nand the website is www.coolmitt.com.\nSo CoolMitt is just\nC-O-O-L-M-I-T-T. coolmitt.com\n- It's a great website.\nWhen I went there, it says that right now,\nthe technology is only available\nto professional sports teams and military.\nIs that true?\n- Well, where we stand now\nis the new version of the technology\nis sort of in beta test versions.\nWe got it into the hands of people\nwho had used the technology before.\nSo there's NFL teams that are using.\nThere's college teams. There's Olympics.\nThere's the Navy SEALs,\nMajor League Baseball, the NBA,\nthe National Tennis Association.\nThey have locations where\nnow they are trying this out\nand reporting back, how's it working?\nHow could you change it?\nHow could you improve it? And so forth.\nSo that's where we are.\nBut on the website,\nyou can actually sign up for\nbeing one who will be able\nto get one [chuckles]\nwhen they are finally manufactured.\nThey're now being made\nin fairly small lots,\nbecause you want to change\nthings as you realize how\nit can be improved.\n- Yeah. This is Stanford after all.\nYou want to get the technology right.\nI like to joke that one of\nthe reasons I like being\nat Stanford so much is that,\nnot only are my colleagues amazing\nand they're so forward thinking,\nbut they're all perfectionists.\nAnd so that the perfectionist mindset\nis it has to be perfect before\nit can go live, so to speak.\nWell, I think there will\nbe a lot of interest.\nLet's talk about the technology in\na little more detail for a moment.\nAnd then let's talk about\nwhether or not cruder forms\nof that technology exist\neither for sake of safety\nand/or performance.\nSo what is, the CoolMitt,\nas I understand is\nit's a mitt, it's a glove.\nYou put your hand into,\nyou hold on to a surface.\nAnd that surface cools your hand\nand thereby through\nthis specialized portal,\ncools your core body temperature\nand all the muscles of the body.\nSubjectively, if I were\nto do this right now,\nwould I think that it was ice cold\nor would I think it was just cool?\n- Just cool.\n- I see.\n- Ice cold is too cold.\nSo people always ask, well,\nwhy can't you just stick your\nhand in a bucket of ice water?\nIt's too cold.\nWhat that does is that causes reflex,\na vasoconstriction of the very\nportals that you're trying\nto maximize the heat loss from.\nSo you stick your hand in cold water,\nand when it comes out, it's cold.\n- You just sealed up all the heat\nin your body.\n- Yeah.\nRight, so what I sort of recommended\nto someone at one point,\nthey said, \"Well, when I'm running,\ncan't I just carry a frozen juice can,\nand it will gradually melt?\"\nAnd I said, \"Well, no,\nbecause that's going to\ndecrease the heat loss\nfrom that hand.\nBut if every couple\nminutes you switched hands,\n[chuckles] it might work.\n- Well, I have a feeling that there\nare people now doing that\nas well as trying this.\nSo how long, in the CoolMitt\nat the proper temperature,\nhow long are people putting\ntheir hands into the Mitt?\n- We, once again, had just\nstandardized them three minutes.\nAnd part of the reason for that is that\nthe rate of heat loss is\nan exponentially declining curve, okay?\nAnd three minutes sort of gets\nthe best part of the curve.\nSo you can go longer and get more benefit,\nbut the biggest bang for the buck\nis in the first two, three minutes.\n- Okay, you mentioned a number\nof impressive organizations,\nsports teams, and military\nthat are using this.\nThis is not something that I typically see\non the sidelines of games.\nAlthough to be honest, I\nhaven't looked very carefully.\nI'm guessing that they\nare probably keeping\nthe technology somewhat under wraps.\nWhere, and how are they doing this?\nAre they running back to the locker room?\nI mean, the military special operators\nare doing their thing,\nbut in terms of the athletes,\nis it possible, hypothetically,\nthat athletes are doing\nthis somewhat incognito?\n- It's possible, but I really don't know.\nPeople have mentioned here at Stanford,\nthey don't see the football team using it.\nWell, the football team here at Stanford\nis mostly playing in cold\nweather, cool weather.\nThe night games are cool.\nEven day games are not\nvery hot frequently here.\nBut when they go to a hot\nplace like Arizona or Utah,\nat least our coach,\nShaw, says that they take it with them\nand that's when they find the benefit.\nThat's when they use it.\n- Interesting, so is\nthere a poor person's,\npoor man or woman's version of this?\nYou mentioned the juice\ncan passing back and forth.\nYou mentioned cooling the hands.\nA number of people said\nto me after learning\na little bit about this\nscience and technology\nthat they've experienced some big effects,\npositive effects of cooling by,\nand I confess, I've done this,\ntaking a package of frozen blueberries,\nand just kind of passing it back\nand forth between my hands.\nNow talking to you,\nI realize I probably\ndidn't do it long enough.\nI probably was,\nI was only doing maybe 30\nseconds passing it back\nand forth between my hands\nand then going back into sets.\nI did see a performance\nenhancing effect. Absolutely.\nBut I realized I probably\nwasn't optimizing the protocol.\nIf you were going to give\na crude protocol for it,\nlet's just say for the gym,\nbecause with running,\nit's a little bit tricky,\nbut what would that look like\nif people wanted to just play with this\nin some sort of fashion?\n- Well, it would be experimental.\n- Sure. Yeah, none of\nthat is very controlled.\n- Your idea of frozen peas is a good idea.\nAnd I think since there's\nbeen no actual study of that,\nit would have to be you working out\nwhat is the best for you.\nBut one way to figure it out is that if,\nafter you hold the cold peas in one hand\nand you switch it to the other hand,\nif someone then comes in, feels your hand,\nis it warm or cold?\nIf it's cold, it means\nyou vasoconstricted.\nIf it's warm, it means the hot\nblood is still going there.\nOkay. So we do that in the lab.\n- And the key is for it\nto not vasoconstrict?\n- Right.\n- Okay.\nSo there's a test out there, folks.\nIf you're going to try this\nin kind of a crude fashion,\nat least until\nthe CoolMitt is available more broadly\nto the general public,\nyou want to assess whether or not\nyour palms actually feel cool\nto the touch by somebody else.\nAnd if it does,\nthat means you've essentially\nshut down the portal.\nYou're sealing in more heat, which is bad.\nWhat about putting this\ncold pack of some sort\non the face or-\n- Or the feet?\n- Or the feet?\nI work out at home.\nI don't often work out barefooted,\nbut I suppose I could,\nlike they did in the 70s.\nWhen those guys were\nwalking around without shoes\nand squatting without\nany shoes or socks on.\nCould I put my feet on them?\n- You could.\nIf you simply had a water-profused pad\nand you were circulating\ncool water through it,\nyou could just put your feet on it, okay?\nPart of the problem is\nthat you don't want,\nif, let's say you have just\na cold pack of something.\nThe problem is back to\nboundary layers again.\nIf you don't have a convective\nstream of the cooling medium,\nthe heat sink is not as effective,\nbecause there'll be a\nboundary layer developed\nbetween the heat sink\nmaterial and your skin.\nSo that decreases its efficacy.\n- I see, maybe we should\njust for a moment,\ntalk about convection,\nradiation, and convection,\nand just make that clear.\nLike if I put my hands,\nlet's say it's a cold\nnight and I'm at a campfire\nand I take my hands and I\nput them out to the fire-\n- You're getting radiation.\n- You're getting radiation.\n- Right.\n- Okay.\n- Right.\n- And then if it's a windy warm night, no,\nI don't know if that's the best example.\nGive us a good example of convection.\n- Convection, sure, is in a cool breeze.\nThe wind chill factor. That's\ndue to convection, okay?\nBut in terms of heat\ntransfer between two objects,\nif you have convection of the medium,\nwhether it's blood on the\ninside and water on the outside,\nyou increase the heat exchange\nif you have conviction on both sides.\n- Right, so this is why\njust planting my feet\non two packages of froze,\nmy bare feet on two\npackages of frozen peas,\nthere's really no opportunity\nfor circulation of,\nand therefore heat transfer.\nSo it's not really optimal, which, and I-\n- But once again,\nit depends on the surface area\nto get any benefit at all.\nWe have a study that we published,\nwhich was investigating\nthe standard treatment\nfor hyperthermia in the field.\nAnd the standard treatment,\nas recommended by medical organizations,\nis you take cold packs and you put them\nin the axilla, the groin.\n- The axilla or the armpit.\n- The armpits, the groin, which is-\n- Thin-skinned, lots of vasculature.\n- Right, and the neck.\nSo what we did is we did studies\nin which we made people hyperthermic.\nAnd then we measured the rate\nat which we cool call them\nby putting those positions\nin those heat exchange bags,\nin the recommended location\nversus on the glabrous skin\nversus palms, soles, and face.\nThe cooling rate was double.\n- Wow.\n- And we put the same ice packs,\nthe same cold packs on the heat portals,\nrather than the axilla,\nthe groin and the face.\n- Wow.\n- Or the neck.\n- Wow, so face, hands and bottoms of feet\nwill cool you twice as\nfast as putting cold packs\ninto your armpits, your\ngroin, or back of neck?\n- So I like to give the analogy of\nif your car is overheating, okay?\nAnd you have a hose, a garden hose,\nwhere should you spray\nyour cooling system?\nShould you spray the\nradiator or should you spray\nthe tubes going in and\nout of the radiator?\nWell, the rationale with\nputting these cold packs\nin the axilla, the groin, and the neck,\nis that you're getting close\nto the major arteries, okay?\nSure. That's going to be effective.\nBut it's much more effective\nif you actually increase\nthe heat loss capacity\nof the radiating surface, the radiators.\n- So you cool the hot stuff\nheading toward the core?\n- That's essentially what\nthe standard operating procedure is.\nThat you hit the arteries.\n- Amazing.\n- And the veins.\nArteries and veins.\n- I'm going to just tell a\nbrief story that illustrates\nhow almost everybody\ngets this stuff wrong.\nAnd I'm going to use\nthat as an opportunity\nto ask you about heating,\ndeliberate heating,\nas opposed to deliberate cooling.\nSo about four months ago,\na friend of mine, incidentally,\na guy who did nine\nyears in the SEAL Teams,\nreally skilled cold water swimmer.\nWe went out for a swim in the morning.\nI'm not nearly even close to the being\nin the same universe of\nhis output potential.\nWe do these swims. I'm familiar with them.\nI got enough blubber on\nme that I stay warm enough\nin the cold Pacific, no wetsuits.\nWe do the morning cold swim\nfor about a mile or so.\nAnd we brought with us up a\nyoung kid that I know real well\nthat hangs out with us\nsometimes and trains with us\nwho's got very little body fat.\nHe's just exceptionally lean,\ndespite eating everything in sight, right?\nTeenager, great athlete,\ngreat kid, great swimmer.\nSo we're out there swimming\nand at some point we're talking to him\nand it's clear that he's gone hypothermic.\nHe's slurring his words.\nHe's not doing well. So\nwe get him onto the beach.\nHis teeth are turning\nyellow. He's quaking.\nHis saliva is taken on that\nconsistency that's clear,\nlike he's hypothermic.\nWe go to the lifeguard station.\nLifeguard says, \"Okay,\nlet's get his vitals.\nLet's do all this.\"\nMeanwhile, trying stand next to him,\nand heat him up by heating up his torso.\nSo there we are, pressing\nagainst this guy, our friend,\ntrying to heat him up.\nThey get a blanket on him.\nI'm realizing he was barefoot.\nHis face was exposed.\nAlthough we did cover his\nhead with the blanket.\nAnd he eventually came back.\nWe got some warm liquids\ninto him and he was okay.\nHe was fine.\nI don't know whether his mother's\never going to let him swim with us again.\nIf I ever disappear and go missing,\nit's because of that incident.\nAnyway, he did great.\nHe recovered. He's back in\nthe water and doing well.\nBut I realized that pretty\nmuch everything from the point\nwhere we got back on the\nbeach until he was back\nto normal, we did incorrectly.\nWe heated his torso.\nWe left his extremities exposed.\nAnd we assumed we were\ndoing the right thing.\nAnd the lifeguard is a skilled lifeguard\nat a major public beach.\nSo I guess the simple question is,\ndid we get everything wrong?\nDid we get anything right?\nAnd what would have been the better option\nto heat up a hypothermic person in that,\nor similar situation?\n- Well, it's interesting you asked that,\nbecause that is the way we got\ninto this area of investigation.\nI worked on how the hypothalamus\nregulates body temperature,\nneurophysiology.\nAnd one day we were having a\ndiscussion with a colleague\nin the department of anesthesia.\nAnd he jokingly said to my\ncolleague, he said, \"Yeah,\nyou guys think you know\nso much about temperature.\nI bet you couldn't solve a problem we have\nin the recovery room.\"\nWhat's that?\nWell, the patient's come out of surgery.\nThey're hypothermic and it takes us hours\nto get them to stop shivering.\nWhat do they do in the recovery room?\nExactly what you suggested.\nThey put on warm blankets,\nthey put on heat lamps,\nand it takes them an hour or\ntwo hours to get these patients\nto stop shivering, to bring them back up.\nSo we said, \"Ah, it's a trivial problem.\"\nNo. It's a hard problem.\nIt's a hard problem,\nbecause when you're under\nanesthesia, you're vasodilated.\nWhen you come out of anesthesia,\nyou're hypothermic and you vasoconstrict,\nand that makes it very difficult\nto get heat into the body.\nSo we got the idea that, well,\nif we could just take one\nappendage, like an arm,\nand we put it in a environment wrapped\nin a heating pad and a negative pressure,\nsuction, that would pull\nmore blood into that limb,\nthat blood would get heated\nand it would warm the body up faster.\nSo my colleague built a prototype device.\nYou couldn't get such a device\ninto the hospital these days.\n[Craig laughs]\nBut we were with our\nanesthesiologist friend,\nwe took it into the recovery room.\nAnd the first thing that\npatient said, \"No way,\nyou're not going to put\nthat on my patient.\"\nBut he prevailed and first\npatient didn't shiver at all,\nFirst patient was back\nto normal temperature,\ncore temperature in, I\nthink, it was eight minutes.\n- Amazing.\n- Eight or nine minutes.\n- Is this now standard practice\nin hospitals?\n- No. No, no.\n- So this is another example where,\nI don't get upset about the,\nalthough it's upsetting\nto know that it's not,\nbut I think that it's\nyet another case where\na fundamental problem exists.\nThere's a science-based\nsolution that makes sense\nat the level of physiology,\nengineering and practice,\nand yet it's not being done.\n- [Craig] Right.\n- And, I mean,\nthat's a whole other discussion as to\nwhat the limitations are.\nWell, perhaps in,\nand I know a number of our listeners are\nin the healthcare and medical profession,\nas well as military, athletes,\nand just also standard\nother types of jobs,\ncivilians doing other types of work.\nIt would be wonderful if\npeople understood this.\nSo once again,\nis there a homegrown technology\nthat people could use?\nIf somebody is hypothermic,\nwhat is going to be the best\nway for them to warm up?\nIs it going to be holding\na nice warm mug of cocoa\nor something like that?\nBut not too hot, I\nguess, is again the idea.\n- Yeah, well, actually you can go hotter\non the glabrous skin.\n- Oh, because it'll dilate?\n- Because it takes the\nheat away faster, okay?\nBut back to the anesthesia,\nwhat you can do is you can use warm pads.\nThey have them in all hospitals,\nthey have circulating\nwater, perfused pads.\n- Hot water bottle type stuff.\n- Put them on the feet.\nPut them on the feet.\n- So typically they'll\nslide them under your lower\nback or something like that?\n- Yeah, put them on the feet.\nOkay, sure. That will do it.\nBut it turns out that we\ndiscovered through this work\nthat it had nothing to\ndo with the whole arm.\nIt was only the hand.\nAnd that's when we came to the realization\nof these special blood vessels.\nWe didn't discover the blood vessels\nthat are described in \"Grey's Anatomy,\"\nbut nobody knew what they were for.\n- And you mentioned bears earlier\nand other hairy animals.\nDo they have\nthese AVAs as well?\n- Oh, yeah.\n- And I suppose we haven't defined AVAs.\nWe've been pretty good about\nthe no acronyms rule. AVAs is?\n- Arteriovenous anastomosis.\nSo a connection between the\narteries and the veins. Yeah.\n- I actually used this technology.\nI have a bulldog, bulldog mastiff.\nHe has a very high\npropensity for overheating,\nbecause they're terrible at dumping heat.\nAnd bulldogs are great\nat pushing themselves\nto the point of exhaustion or death.\nIt happens, and so now we do\nwhat we call palmar cooling.\nSorry, I couldn't help myself.\nWhere I'll take Costello\nand lower him into\na cool body of water.\nJust the bottoms of his paws,\nalthough I think animals\ninstinctually know\nto do this and will go and\nstand in bodies of water.\nThey don't often lie down\nall the way. Some do.\nBut they seem to know that's a great way\nto cool themselves off.\n- Yeah. Oh, absolutely, yeah.\n- And they get the advantage\nthat their palms and\ntheir feet are essentially\nthe same thing.\n- We actually built devices for dogs.\nDid you really?\n- And tried them on.\nI did a lot of sled dogs\nand it worked beautifully.\nThey had little backpacks\nwith the equipment and pads\non all their feet and\nit worked beautifully.\n- Amazing, amazing, along\nthe lines of heating,\ndeliberate heating, wearing a knit cap\nis something that you see more\nof that on the East Coast:\npeople run around Boston and New England\nwith a knit cap.\nI've always done that\nat the start of my runs to\ntry and warm up more quickly.\nAnd then I take it off.\nI shed layers as I go.\nIs that a rational practice?\nThe way I just described it?\n- Oh, sure.\nYeah.\n- Yeah?\n'Cause warming up is important too.\nThere's a certain amount\nof quote/unquote warming up\nthat's required to lubricate joints\nor at least to get the sense\nthat joints are lubricated\nand to be able to move more easily.\n- Yeah.\n- Do you still recommend\nthat people warm up?\n- Yeah, but I think we're\nmisled by the term warm up\nas if the major purpose\nis to raise temperature.\nI'm not aware of any data on this,\nbut I do think that the major contribution\nis increasing flexibility.\nSo you're going to avoid\nhaving damage of joints\nand tendons and ligaments and so forth.\nBut also the ability of the mitochondria\nto produce energy can be\nimpaired at lower temperatures.\nAnd you have to keep in mind\nthat we say our body\ntemperature's 37 degrees,\nbut that's not true.\n- Yeah. It varies across the day.\n- Well, it varies in parts of your body.\nI mean, my hands and arms are\nnot at 37 degrees right now.\nThey're much lower, okay? [chuckles]\n- So that raises an interesting question.\nWhat is the best way to\nmeasure core body temperature?\n- Well, the best core temperature is that,\nwhat we use is esophageal.\nSo we put a thermocouple\nup the nose about two feet\ndown the esophagus.\nSo that is about the level of your heart.\n- Not gym or home-practical, although-\n- No.\n- I don't know.\nSome of those COVID swab\ntests go pretty far.\nI can't even imagine going any further.\nI felt like my brain was getting tickled.\n- The tympanic is pretty good.\n- So the ear?\n- The ear.\nIt's not foolproof because you have\nto actually have it aimed\nproperly at the tympanum\nand frequently what you're getting\nis you're getting sort of a mixture\nof tympanic plus ear canal temperature.\n- And for those listening\nand for those watching,\nthe tympanic is not going to be the pinna,\nthis part of the ear, the\nouter part of the ear.\nThe tympanic is going to heading\ntowards the tympanic membrane.\nAnd yes, I'm sticking my finger in my ear,\nbecause that's where the\nlaser would actually have\nto go to measure your temperature.\n- Right.\n- So when we're walking into restaurants\nand other places nowadays,\nand they're shining the\nlaser at our forehead,\nthat's probably giving\na pretty crude readout of temperature.\n- It is, but there's much less insulation\nbetween your brain and your forehead skin\nthan there is between your\nbiceps and your arm skin.\nSo if you're going to measure\na surface temperature,\nthat's where you would do it.\nAnd we do temperatures in the infrared.\nWe take infrared videos of athletes\nand our subjects.\nAnd of course the face lights up.\n- Okay, so if we're not,\nI imagine there's going to\nbe a technology coming soon\nwhere you can point your smartwatch\nor your smartphone at yourself,\nand you're going to get a heat map.\n- Right, right.\n- If somebody out there\nhasn't already invented this\nfor the typical folks outside military,\nsomebody please invent that,\nbecause I think there's growing interest\nin temperature based on\nthe work that you're doing.\nAnd also for sake of something\nI do want to touch on,\nwhich is sleep and metabolism.\nAlthough we don't want to open\nup those portals all the way,\nbecause we'd need\nseveral days to cover it.\nOkay, so putting on the cap,\nwhat about some of the helmets and gloves\nthat are used in typical sports?\nDo you think that those\ncan be improved in order\nto improve performance in terms\nof their ventilation ability\nor keeping palmar surfaces\nopen for instance?\n- Well, you mentioned about\nthe knit cap in cold weather,\nespecially, and that is significant,\nbecause you do lose a lot\nof heat from your head,\nbut it's a constant heat loss.\nIt's not variable like your glabrous skin.\nSo if you decrease that heat loss,\nyou're going to be warmer.\nSo, sure. That has an impact.\nNow in terms of helmets,\nthey should be ventilated.\nI mean, they should have enough space\nin them and holes in them\nso that air can circulate.\nYou don't want to insulate,\nthermally insulate your scalp.\nThat's going to decrease\nheat loss quite considerable.\nJust for a resting individual,\nthe brain is about 20% of your metabolism.\nSo that's a lot of heat production.\n- Yeah, absolutely, I\nrealized there was a question\nthat I failed to ask earlier\nthat is burning in my mind now.\nAnd I think is likely burning in the minds\nof some of the listeners, which is,\nso if you do this cooling\nin between sets in the gym,\nyou get this performance enhancing effect.\nYou don't get the delayed\nonset muscle soreness,\nwhich is great.\nSo presumably the body is adapting.\nYou're getting better as a\nconsequence of being able\nto do more work per unit\ntime or to go harder\nin some way of course.\nYou get that adaptation.\nDoes that mean that you see a\nperformance-enhancing effect,\neven when you don't cool,\nif you've previously done\nthe cooling workouts?\nSo for instance, let's say\nI can do 10 sets of 10 dips,\nwhich I like to think I can.\nBut maybe I need to go try.\nI dunno if I've done that recently.\nI do the cooling.\nI cool for three minutes between sets.\nAnd let's say I get to the\npoint where I can do 20\nfor 10 sets, 10 sets of 20 repetitions.\nAnd then I don't cool.\nWill I be able to match\nor approximate my new, better performance?\n- You keep your gains. It's\na true conditioning effect.\nYou respond to the increased work volume\nby all of those mechanisms you mentioned.\n- [Andrew] Amazing.\n- You increase the number\nof contractual elements\nin your muscles.\n- Amazing.\n- The muscles get bigger.\n- Amazing.\n- We had an experiment that involved some\nof our female students.\nNot athletes, but just regular,\nthey were freshmen actually.\nAnd the experiment was 10 sets of pushups\nto muscle failure with or without cooling.\n- Same regimen, three minutes of cooling\nin between sets of pushups?\n- Right.\n- Okay.\n- Some of those young ladies\nreached over 800 pushups.\n- Now the total duration of the workout\ncould be getting much\nlonger as a consequence\nof doing more work.\n- No.\n- No, it doesn't take you longer.\nWell, minor, I mean, a\npush-up is pretty fast.\n- Yeah. It's pretty fast.\n- Yeah.\nSo you do 10 sets, the\nmaximum 45 minutes total.\nThe most-\n- That's a lot of pushups.\n- That's a lot of pushups.\n- Yep.\n- And so the interesting\nthing is they came in one day\nand they said, \"Dr. Heller,\nyou cost us a lot of money.\"\n\"Why?\" \"Well, we had a\nformal dance this weekend.\nWe all had to buy new sleeveless dresses.\"\n- Nice.\n[Craig laughs]\nIt's a good problem to\nhave. Good problem to have.\nLet's talk about steroids,\nanabolic steroids.\nWe're heading into an Olympics.\nEvery time the Olympics rolls around,\nyou hear about these cases\nof people getting popped,\nas they call it, or caught\nfor anabolic steroids.\nThere are some accusations out there.\nNow they'll be out more.\nThis'll get handled in the press\nand in the various organizations.\nClearly athletes and non-athletes\nuse anabolic steroids.\nAnd typically anabolic steroids are\nof the testosterone variety.\nThere are derivatives, et cetera.\nAnd those derivatives do different things\nin the anabolic versus\nandrogenic, et cetera.\nBut typically the idea is,\nat least as I understand it,\nin talking to some of these individuals,\nis that they allow people to train more,\nbecause they recover faster.\nThey are able to synthesize more protein,\nbecause they're basically\ngetting a second puberty,\nbecause as we all know during puberty,\nthere's a lot of growth of the body.\nAnd of course there are a lot\nof negative effects of abuse\nof these things and they are banned\nfrom various sports organizations,\nespecially, I should\nmention, in combat sports,\nit's especially concerning,\nbecause in combat sports,\na performance enhancement means\nthat you can harm somebody\nmore than you would be able to otherwise\nas opposed to in other sorts of sports.\nJust to conceptualize it.\nAnd I'm not taking a moral\nstance on any of this.\nI just want to ask you,\nwhen you compare palmar\ncooling to anabolic steroids\nin terms of gym performance,\nwhat do you see?\n- Well, we do not do research\non steroids, [chuckles]\nbut there is a lot of\nresearch in the literature.\nA lot of that research in\nthe strength conditioning\nmagazines is not very scientific.\n- No.\n- Okay?\n- Or it might not even\nbe scientific at all.\n- Right.\n- Right.\n- But we did do an analysis\nof reputable papers\nand we did find, I think it\nwas probably eight or nine,\n10 studies on bench press,\nincrease in bench press performance\non steroids or not, okay?\n- These were males or females?\n- Well, these were all males,\nbut I'll get back to the females, okay?\nThe bottom line is that in all\nof these independent studies,\ntheir rate of improvement was\napproximately 1% per week.\n- Okay.\n- Okay?\nNow I've just told you about studies\nin which we've had 300%\nincrease in a month.\n[Craig chuckles]\nSo.\n- It's an enormous, enormous difference.\n- So why would you endanger your health\nas well as your legal ability\nto compete with such an ineffective tool?\n- Yeah, no, I think it's the notion\nof performance enhancement\nis a really interesting one,\nbecause people clearly pay\nattention to nutrition.\nSleep is now something\nthat I think everybody,\nbut especially athletes\nare paying attention to.\n- Right.\n- And I predict that\ntemperature will be one\nof the more powerful parameters\nthat people are going\nto be focusing on.\n- Yeah. That's true.\n- Because of the magnitude of the effects\nthat you're describing\nand also because so\nmuch of the variability\naround performance, as you mentioned,\nhas to do with when you\ngo to a new environment,\neveryone has their home\nenvironment worked out pretty well.\nSleep well in your own bed at home.\nWhen you can control everything,\nyour performance is always great.\nThis is why I think\nmilitary special operators\nare particularly interesting group,\nbecause their whole world\nis centered around elite\nand high performance with very high risk,\nhigh consequence under\nvariable conditions.\nThe essence of their work\nis variable unpredictable conditions.\nSo you mentioned female\nathletes and steroids.\nI'm curious about this.\n- Yeah, because everybody\nhas always said to us, well,\nyou only use male subjects\nand obviously they have this\ntestosterone background.\nThey have higher levels of testosterone.\nThat's why you get these results.\nSo we did a comparative study on females.\nWe get the same results.\n- Impressive, and these are\nStanford athletes or also-\n- No, these were not Stanford athlete,\nthey were Stanford students.\nBut not athletes.\nWell, we have done, of\ncourse, work on some athletes.\nBut in general, we don't\ndo research on our teams,\nour varsity teams.\nSo they have their own protocols.\nThey have their own training program.\n- Yeah. They don't like us\nto get too close to them.\nI work with some of these\nfolks in the coaches\nand they are very skeptical,\nwith good reason also.\nAnd the reason I ask is that\nwhen you see these Pac-10 or\nDivision I college athletes,\nand then you see their peers,\nthere's clearly a difference, right?\nI mean, they are pedigreed\nat throughout, right?\nAnd more typical folks\nalso have different goals.\nThey may not want to\nget infinitely stronger\nor perform more endurance work.\nSo I want to ask you a couple of things\nabout shivering and metabolism,\n'cause I think they're very interesting\nand sufficiently related.\nSo my understanding is that shiver\nis an adaptation that's\ndesigned to heat us up.\n- Yes.\n- That we have brown fat\nthat's in compartments\naround our body that\nare activated by shiver\nor co-activated by shiver.\nAnd that shivering is useful\nfor increasing metabolism.\nIs that true? And does it require\nthat cold be the stimulus?\nSo two scenarios. I'll\ngive you an experiment.\nI put someone into cold\nwater of some sort,\nand then I make them get out\nor I have them stand near it,\nand then they start shivering.\nMy understanding is that their\nmetabolism will increase.\nWhat if I take someone and\nI just have them shiver,\nbut they're not exposed by cold,\nit's kind of a deliberate shivering.\nWill that also create a\nsubstantial increase in metabolism?\n- Sure, so deliberate\nshivering without cold\nis essentially what happens\nwhen you get a fever.\nYour set point goes up\nin your hypothalamus\nand you actually,\neven though you're a\nnormal body temperature,\nyour thermostat is telling\nyou you're too cold,\nincrease your metabolism.\nSo shiver, right?\nSo, sure, shivering is a good\nway of increasing metabolism,\nbut it only can take\nmetabolism up maybe three\nor four times resting.\n- Okay, but it seems like-\n- Whereas exercise can\ntake you up 10 times.\n- Got it. All right.\nI'm going to ask a couple\nof more random questions\nand seemingly random.\nDo bears actually hibernate?\n- Oh, yeah.\n- The true hibernation?\n- Well, it depends on how you define true.\nA bear, actually, we've\ndone a lot of work on bears.\n[Craig chuckles]\n- Do you also put the\nnose thermal couple down\nin the esophagus?\n- We implant them surgically.\n- They're anesthetized\nwhen you implant them?\n- Yes.\n- Khat kind of bears are these?\n- Black bears.\n- Okay.\n- And did this with colleagues\nat University of Alaska.\nAnd we're analyzing the data now,\nbut what we've done is\nwe've had now a total of 18\nbears and we implant them\nwith EEG, EKG, temperature sensors,\nand sometimes we actually\nmeasure their oxygen consumption.\n- These are bears in the wild?\n- These are bears in the wild,\nbut they're brought in\nto University of Alaska\nwhere we keep them in\nan outdoor enclosure.\nSo they're hibernating in\na nest box in an enclosure,\nand we're recording this\nelectrophysiological data\ncontinuously for six months.\n- Amazing. How do I get on this protocol?\n[Craig chuckles]\n[Andrew chuckling]\nCraig and I are doing some\nwork together going forward.\nAnd maybe you can slide me\nonto this protocol too, it sounds amazing.\n- Right now, it's a matter of\njust analyzing the gigabytes,\nterabytes of data that\nhave been collected.\nBut anyway, you asked about hibernation.\nSo bears only go down to about 33,\n34 degrees centigrade in core temperature.\nAnd that's been argued that, well,\nthey can't go lower because\nthey have so much insulation.\nThey're so big, their surface\nvolume ratio, and so forth,\nand that's not true.\nThey shiver, so if we have\na day like a minus 40,\nwhich you get up in Alaska,\nthey will go through periods of shivering.\nAnd maintain a core temperature on 33-34.\nNow the ground squirrels and the marmots,\nwhich are smaller animals,\nthey will drop down to a body temperature\nmaybe within a degree of the environment.\nSo they can go down to one\nor two degrees centigrade\njust above freezing during\nbouts of hibernation.\nSo they'll stay in hibernation\nfor seven or eight days\nand they'll come back up\nto normal body temperature\nfor a day, then they'll go back down,\nand do another about-\n- What do they do during\nthat day when they're warming up again?\nDo go around-\n- They rearrange their nests,\neat, if they've stored food.\nSome species store lots of food.\nOthers just depend on their fat.\n- A former mentor of mine,\nmy master's degree mentor,\nand a colleague and friend\nof yours, Irving Zucker\nat UC Berkeley told me a story once,\ntold me a lot of stories,\nhe tells great stories,\nas you know.\nHe told me that when an animal comes out\nof hibernation periodically,\nthat it's a very dramatic\nthing to observe.\nThat it's not like they wake up\nand yawn and look around,\nbut it's like a complete\nepileptic seizure.\n- Right.\n- What what's going on?\n- Shiver.\n- It's just a very traumatic shiver.\n- So at the low temperatures,\nthey cannot shiver because\nthe effect of temperature\non the conduction of the\nnerves and the muscle fiber.\n- So they're shut down basically?\n- They're shut down.\nSo there they use brown fat.\nSo they activate brown fat\nand then when they get up to\na temperature of maybe 15,\n16 degrees centigrade,\nthen the shivering starts and\nit gets very, very violent,\nbut they're still asleep.\n- Do we shiver in our sleep?\n- I would imagine we do,\nbut it probably wakes us up.\n- Interesting, So the brown\nfat is kind of like kindling?\n- The brown fat is a tissue\nwhich has lots of stored\nenergy, 'cause it's fat,\nbut unlike our white fat, our regular fat,\nit also has lots of\nthese little powerhouses,\nmitochondria, and lots of blood supply.\nSo essentially it is a\ntissue just to produce heat.\nThat's what it's there for.\nNow in these hibernators,\nthere are big patches of\nbrown fat at certain locations\nthat are critical, like\naround the heart, for example.\nFor us, the brown fat\nis sort of distributed.\nSo for many, many years,\nit was thought humans\ndon't have brown fat,\nbut indeed we do.\nIt's just not localized\ninto discrete fat pads,\nlike it is in ground squirrels, marmots.\n- I don't know why the phrase\nfat pads is so satisfying\nto say, but it is fat pads.\nSpeaking of fat pads,\nI was taught that we have,\nby the internet, I should say,\nI was taught by the internet\nthat we have brown fat\nbetween our scapulae and our upper neck.\nIs that truly a source of\nbrown enrichment for brown fat?\n- If you're a ground squirrel.\n[Andrew scoffs]\n- So this is all the drawings out there?\nOkay, so what I'm hearing\nyou say is that brown fat\nis actually distributed in patch-\n- In humans, it's distributed\nalong with other fat tissue.\nIt's not as discreet.\n- So the reason I'm kind of shocked\nand amused and troubled by this is\nbecause there is a\nsomewhat standard protocol\nin the performance,\nwellness, whatever world,\nwhatever you want to call it,\nof putting ice packs on\nthe upper back as a way\nto stimulate brown fat thermogenesis.\nI'm hearing some inhales of concern\nfrom the physiologist.\nSo tell me why,\nit sounds like that's\nprobably not the best way\nto stimulate brown fat activation.\n- Well, let's put it this way-\nYou're not attacking anyone specifically,\nbecause the whole little believes this.\n- But it may not be\ntotally facetiae or false.\nThink of what that's doing.\nIf you put ice right there\nwhere your spinal cord\nis close to the surface,\nthat's where you're going to\nhit the vertebral arteries.\nSo you're essentially putting\na cold source into the brain,\nto the hypothalamus.\nThe hypothalamus is you're too cold.\nSo it is going to turn on\nshivering and brown fat so.\n- Would there be a better site\nfor sake of activating brown fat?\nPalmar cooling?\n- I can't say because the\nactivation of brown fat\nis a sympathetic nervous system response.\nSo any lowering of core temperature\nthat will let the thermostat\nsay you're too cold\nis going to turn on sympathetic.\nNow people will have perhaps\ndifferent amounts of brown fat.\nSo newborn have more\nbrown fat than adults.\n- 'Cause the newborns\ncan't shiver. Correct?\n- I don't know.\n- Okay.\nThat's what I read.\nI don't know if that's true.\nI read that in what I believe\nto be credible sources.\n- Yeah, it could be.\nI just don't know, it depends\non if it's really newborn,\nI can agree because you don't have all\nof the motor pathways connected up yet.\nThat's something that\noccurs in early days of life\nand is probably one of the\nfunctions of REM sleep,\nwhich infants have a lot of.\n- Right.\n- Okay.\nBut how to activate brown fat\nif you are consistently exposed to cold?\nSo if you live in the Arctic\nand you go out jogging\nin the winter,\nmaybe that will increase the\namount of brown fat you have.\nIf you live in the tropics,\nmaybe you have less brown fat.\nI don't know.\nI don't know of any studies\nwhich have looked into that.\n- Okay. Ice headache.\nSometimes I'll drink a\ncold beverage or I'll\neat ice cream in my head will-\n- Brain freeze.\n- Brain freeze.\nAnd speaking of special\nforces, I was talking to,\nwe all see the images of the SEALs,\nSEAL training slash screening in Coronado\nwhere they're going in\nand out of the Pacific,\nwhich is very cold.\nBut I know they also spend some\ntime in the very cold waters\nof Kodiak, Alaska.\nYou mentioned Alaska.\nBrain freeze, so-called ice headache,\nis a common occurrence\nthere in those situations.\nBut we all have experienced this.\nWe eat ice cream, and you\nget that brain freeze.\nI can feel it right now a\nlittle bit subjectively.\nI can induce it.\nWhat's going on there?\nAnd I would always just rub my tongue\non the roof of my mouth.\nIs there something that I'm\ndoing that's functional there\njust to try and alleviate it?\n- Good question, the\nthing is that the roof\nof your mouth is very\nclose to your hypothalamus.\nSo if indeed it's a Popsicle\nthat's giving you the brain freeze,\nit may be a direct cooling\neffect from the roof\nof your mouth and if you\nput your tongue there,\nyou're insulating the roof of your mouth.\nI don't know, I'm guessing.\n- But what's the source\nof the brain freeze?\nIt at vasoconstriction?\n- It's a vasomotor change.\nWhether it's constriction,\nI think it's more likely an\nincrease in blood pressure,\nwhich will essentially cause\nan expansion of the arteries\nand activate pain receptors.\nWe don't have pain receptors\nin the neural tissue\nin the brain.\nWe have them in the meninges\nand predominantly associated\nwith the blood vessels,\nthe walls of the blood vessels.\nSo if you have something\nwhich will dramatically\nincrease your blood\npressure going to the brain,\nyou're likely to get...\nWe've had some preliminary data.\nI even hate to mention this,\nbecause we have not been able\nto pursue it systematically,\nbut we've had some experience with people\nwith migraine that say,\nif they use one of our devices to heat,\nthat the migraine goes away.\nAnd I don't know.\n- Yeah. It's very, and a lot\nof people suffer from migraine.\nI know there are a lot of\ndifferent types of migraine.\nI've been reading a lot about this lately,\nbecause I get so many\nquestions about migraine but.\n- I'd hate to say anything.\n- Sure.\nAnd we'll just underscore\nthis as preliminary\nand people have been\ngreat about understanding\nthat when we say preliminary,\nwe mean it has not passed through\nthe required filters to\ncall it hard fact yet.\n- We don't even have a decent dataset.\nThese are anecdotal report.\n- Yeah, anecdata,\nas people like to call it,\nbut I don't even like\nto call it that because\nwe don't want to give it\nmore weight than it deserves,\nbut that's interesting.\nThe ice headache and the\nincrease in blood pressure\nis interesting because the only thing\nthat I've heard is similar\nto it is something that comes from,\nthey have these competitions\nwhere people eat\nthese very hot chili peppers.\nIt's kind of an ego thing,\nI guess, for reasons that escaped me,\nthat eating really hot peppers.\nAnd every once in a while,\nsomeone will eat one of these and get\nwhat's called thunderclap headache,\nwhere a headache comes on\nextremely quickly and so quickly\nthat it's caused,\nso severe rather that it's\nbeen known to cause stroke\nand brain damage.\nSo these very, very hot peppers,\nif you're not acclimated to\nthem, and maybe even if you are,\nhave been shown to actually\ncause brain damage.\nYeah. Some good evidence for this.\nI do want to talk about something\nthat we have not touched\non yet, which is NEAT.\nNon-exercise induced thermogenesis, right?\nSo non-activity associated thermogenesis.\nAnd the fidgeters, right?\nSo the classic work of\nlike Rothwell and Stock.\nAnd the idea that some people who overeat\nare burning off that energy by way\nof shaking their knee\nor moving around a lot.\nThe quote/unquote nervous types.\nBut they quoted in those studies,\na huge degree of caloric burn,\n800, 2500 calories per\nday burned above those\nwho sit rather still.\nDoes that seem farfetched?\nThose are older data but\nany comment on NEAT or\nnon-exercise induced thermogenesis?\n- Well, I do think it's\npretty straightforward\nthat if you increase muscle\nactivity of any kind,\nyou're increasing your energy consumption\nand your heat production.\nAnd the really extreme example\nis hyper and hypothyroidism.\nPeople that are hyperthyroid or fidgety\nand they have a high metabolic rate\nand they're hot.\nAnd people that are hypothermic are cool.\nThey don't move very much.\nSo any kind of muscle activity increases,\nand when you say it's not much activity,\nbut remember it's only 20% effective.\n80% of the energy is going to heat.\nSo it may not exert much energy\nto tap your foot. [chuckles]\nBut four times the amount\nof energy that is going\ninto the movement is being lost as heat.\n- That's very interesting.\nA couple more quick questions.\nThere's a lot of excitement these days\nor at least usage these days\nof so-called energy drinks\nor pre-workout drinks.\nMany of these contain\nthermogenic compounds.\nSo caffeine, things,\nthere's a culture now of taking arginine,\nthings that support arginine.\nSo beet juice and L-citrulline,\nthings to dilate the blood vessels.\nSometimes this is for sake\nof increasing blood flow\nto the muscles during resistance exercise.\nBut a lot of these are thermogenic,\nis to increase body temperature.\nAnd is it possible that\nsome of these energy drinks\nare actually, or similar,\nsix espresso or whatever it is,\nare acting to prevent optimal performance\nor reduce performance?\n- I don't think that\nthe temperature rise is\nthat, I really don't know,\nbut what it does is it\nmakes you more jittery\nand you're going to increase that NEAT\nthat you were talking about.\nThere's another thing.\nAnd that is that when you\nare exercising your muscle\nand it becomes slightly hypoxic,\nI mean the oxygen suppliers is not enough,\nthe muscle releases adenosine.\nAnd what adenosine does in the muscle\nis cause the blood vessels\nto open up, to dilate.\nSo it's a way of increasing\nthe blood flow to the muscle\nand therefore the oxygen\nsupply to the muscle.\n- And caffeine is essentially\nan adenosine antagonists.\n- An adenosine antagonist. Right.\n- So under the strict logic,\ningesting caffeine will\nreduce adenosine release\nand will reduce oxygen\nutilization of the muscle?\n- Right.\n- So that would lead me to believe that,\nmotivational support aside,\nthat caffeine will hinder\nmuscular performance?\n- I would think so,\nbut I can't give you an\nauthoritative answer on that.\n- Okay, we're just going through the logic\nand the gymnastics around that.\nI think it's a fascinating\narea that deserves attention\nbecause the question\nof what one can ingest\nin order to perform better,\nto say nothing of hormone augmentation,\nbut often leads back to stimulants.\nAnd if those stimulants,\nmost of which include\ncaffeine of some sort,\nare inhibiting the adenosine system\nand the adenosine system is\nsupporting the oxygenation\nof muscle, then I would\nimagine that avoiding them\nmight be the better option.\n- Yeah, I just, I'm not\naware of data that would,\nso this is a general phenomenon\nof adenosine and blood flow.\nIt has of course,\na different effect in the brain.\nAdenosine causes sleep.\nSo caffeine keeps you awake.\nAnd if you stay awake,\nyou're going to have a\nhigher metabolic rate\nthan if you go to sleep.\nAnd the thing is you say, energy drinks,\nthe question is, what really is in them?\n- It's usually a cocktail of things.\nI don't take these, I\ndon't like them at all,\nbut they're usually a\ncombination of vasodilators,\ncaffeine, some sort of stimulant.\n- And source of glucose usually.\n- Sometimes a source of\nglucose and sometimes not.\nAnd oftentimes\nthere are vasodilators and there are\ncompounds that are thought\nto be so-called nootropics,\nsmart drugs that basically\nincrease acetylcholine\nor norepinephrine transmission.\nIn the 80s and 90s,\nthe beta-3 agonist like\nclenbuterol were very popular,\nbut they were all banned.\nSo those were all banned from,\nalthough people used them recreationally,\nwhich I do not recommend.\nThere were actually a number of deaths due\nto dehydration, overheating,\nas well as cardiac effects.\nBefore we wrap up,\nI know you've done a ton of work on sleep.\nI think we're going to\nhave to do another episode\nabout your work on sleep,\nbecause the amount of data\nthat you produce there\nis vast actually.\nSo I first got to know\nyou and your work related\nto sleep and temperature.\nWe all hear nowadays that\nit's good to keep the room\nthat you sleep in cool.\nKeep it dark.\nI've talked a number of\ntimes on podcast episodes\nabout the role of light and\nshifting circadian rhythms.\nI have two questions related to sleep.\nOne is, are there any things that may\nor may not relate to temperature,\nbut that you think are very\nuseful for getting better sleep,\nthat you don't hear that much about,\nthat people might want to consider or try?\nRealizing that there are a lot\nof reasons why people don't sleep great,\nbut what are some things\nthat you don't hear\nthat much about these days\nthat you wish people knew?\n- Well, the sleep medicine\ncommunity now puts\na lot more emphasis on\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nthan on pharmacology.\nSo what cognitive behavioral therapy does\nis it essentially increases\nyour sleep hygiene.\nSo there are certain just general rules.\nSo have a regular bedtime\nand a regular arousal time.\nDon't be skipping back\nand forth all the time.\n- Arousal, you mean wake-up time?\n- Wake-up time, yeah.\n- Spoken like a true physiologist.\n- Right. [laughs]\nYeah, another thing is don't use screens\nwithin a couple hours of bedtime,\nbecause screens are\npredominantly rich in blue light.\nAnd what that does, as you\nmentioned, the circadian system,\nthat affects your circadian system.\nThat pushes off your circadian\nstimulus for sleep, okay?\nAnother thing is of course relax.\nI mean, don't work right up until\nthe time you're going to bed.\nTake some time to do something relaxing.\nAnd then temperature,\nyou've mentioned that.\nAnd for many people, a warm bath\nis really conducive to good sleep.\nAnd people are now swearing by\na cooler environment for sleep.\nAnd that makes sense in\nterms of the circadian effect\non body temperature.\nSo our circadian clock is\neffecting our thermostat.\nSo at the time we go to bed,\nour thermostat is on its way down\nto a lower set point, okay?\nSo what happens?\nYou go to bed and you're\nfeeling a little bit cool.\nSo you pile on lots of blankets.\nAnd then what happens is you\nwake up a little bit later\nand you're hot, so you throw them off.\nIt's because your\nthermostat has set downward.\nNow why is it better to\nhave a cooler environment?\nIt's better to have a cooler environment,\nbecause it's easier to thermoregulate.\nSo you can go to Europe in the summertime\nand the hotel rooms still\nhave these big comforters,\nthese down comforters.\nSo how do you deal with that?\nYou stick out your hands\nand your legs, okay?\n- I've always slept with,\nI have one leg that just kind\na hangs out of the, yeah.\n- But they're your heat\nloss surfaces, right?\nSo if you're in a cool environment,\nyou can take advantage of that.\nYou can take advantage by passively\nregulating your body temperature.\nYou don't have to get\nup and wake up and say,\noh my God, I've got to change\nthe covers or blankets,\nor what have you.\nIf you're in a warm\nenvironment, what can you do?\n- You need to sleep with\none hand in the CoolMitt.\n- Right.\n- Right?\nAnd right now that's not available yet.\n- Right. It's not available.\n- I've never heard about it that way.\nI've always heard you want\nto sleep in a cool room\nor keep the room cold.\n- Yeah.\n- But I never realized why\nthat's useful, which is,\nyou're saying, then you can\nmove these glabrous surfaces\nin and out.\nYou could even also wake up\nunder the blanket completely.\n- Your face. Yeah, yeah.\n- Very, very interesting.\nThat finally a rational\nscience grounded explanation\nfor why we need to sleep in a cool room.\n'Cause I always thought, well,\nif your temperature is going down anyway,\nwhy do you have to sleep in a cool room?\nWhat about wearing socks while you sleep?\nThat was big a few years\nago where they said,\nyou should put socks on.\nNow I would think that's\nprobably the wrong advice.\nYou probably just-\n- Well, I don't know if it's wrong advice.\nThere's an old, old study\nthat was supported by,\nI think, Eddie Bauer,\nthe sleeping bag company.\nAnd what the study showed,\nwhat the study was asking is\nwhat are the most temperature-sensitive\nspots in the body?\nWhere do you feel cold?\nAnd what that showed was it was the toes.\n- That makes sense.\nSo when you sample water with your toe,\nyou always see that.\n[Craig laughs]\n- So the socks essentially\nare promoting thermal comfort\nby insulating that area\nthat's quite sensitive.\nNow of course, if it's too warm,\nyou're not going to put socks on.\n- Right, well, Craig, thank you so much.\nYou gave so much information\nthat's actionable and interesting.\nI know a lot of people are\ngoing to be really interested\nin the palmar cooling\ntechnology from CoolMitt.\nWe will be sure to provide\nresources to the website\nso that people can register interest.\nI do encourage people to play\naround with, so to speak,\nthe palmar cooling\ntechnology that we all have,\nwhich are these glabrous surfaces.\nAnd I also just want to\nthank you for taking time out\nof your busy schedule to\nshare this information.\n- Yeah, you're welcome.\nIt was fun. It was lots of fun.\n- I certainly learned a lot\nand I know a lot of people\nare going to learn a lot\nthat's useful to them.\n- Good questions.\n- Well, fabulous answers.\nThank you.\n- Thank you.\n- Thank you for joining for my discussion\nwith Dr. Craig Heller.\nIf you're enjoying this\npodcast and learning from it,\nplease subscribe to our\nYouTube channel as well.\nYou can give us feedback in\nthe comment section on YouTube\nas to topics you would like\nus to cover, future guests,\nand so on.\nAlso subscribe to the podcast\non Apple and on Spotify.\nAnd on Apple,\nyou have the opportunity to leave us up\nto a five-star review and you can leave us\na comment or feedback there as well.\nPlease also check out our\nsponsors that we mentioned\nat the beginning of the podcast.\nThat's a terrific way\nto support our podcast.\nIn addition, if you're interested\nin supporting research in\nthe Huberman Lab at Stanford,\nyou can go to\nhubermanlab.stanford.edu/giving.\nAnd there you can make a\ntax-deductible donation\nto support research in\nmy laboratory on stress,\nhuman performance, sleep and trauma,\nand topics of that sort.\nIf you're not already\nfollowing us at Huberman Lab\non Instagram or Twitter,\nyou're welcome to do so.\nOn Instagram, I do short\nneuroscience tutorials\nthat are separate from\nthe tutorials that I tend\nto do on the podcast.\nOften on this podcast,\nwe discuss supplements.\nOne of the really important things,\nif you're going to take supplements,\nis that the supplements be\nof the highest quality ingredients\nand that the amount of those ingredients\nthat's listed on the\nlabel actually matches\nwhat is in those supplements.\nWe've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause thorn has the\nhighest levels of stringency\nin terms of quality and\nhow much of each supplement\nthey put in their products.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to Thorne,\nT-H-O-R-N-E.com/the letter U/Huberman.\nAnd there, you can see what I take.\nYou can get 20% off any\nof those supplements\nif you enter the Thorne\nsite through that portal.\nAnd even if you navigate to other products\nand other product pages\nwithin the Thorne site,\nyou can still get that 20% off.\nSo it's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[energetic rock music]"
