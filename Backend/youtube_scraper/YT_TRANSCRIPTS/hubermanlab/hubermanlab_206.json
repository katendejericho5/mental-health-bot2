    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[energetic music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk all about dopamine\nand what drives you to do\nthe things that you do.\nWe're going to talk about\nmotivation and desire and craving,\nbut also how dopamine\nrelates to satisfaction\nand our feelings of wellbeing.\nAnd of course, any\ndiscussion about dopamine\nhas to include a discussion\nabout the potential\nfor dopamine induced addiction.\nIndeed, dopamine lies at\nthe heart of addiction\nto all things.\nBut today we are mainly going to focus on,\nhow what we do and how we do it,\nand how we conceptualize those things\nleads to changes in this amazing molecule\nin our brain and bodies\nthat we call dopamine.\nI'm going to teach you what\ndopamine is and what it is not.\nThere are a lot of myths\nabout the molecule dopamine.\nWe often hear about\nso-called dopamine hits.\nToday, we are going to\ndispel many common myths\nabout dopamine,\nand we are going to talk about\nhow dopamine actually works.\nWe're going to discuss\nthe biology of dopamine,\nthe psychology.\nWe will discuss some neural circuits\nand a really exciting\naspect of dopamine biology\nor so-called dopamine schedules.\nIn other words, we are going to discuss\nhow things like food, drugs,\ncaffeine, pornography,\neven some plant-based compounds can change\nour baseline levels of\ndopamine and in doing so,\nthey change how much dopamine\nwe are capable of experiencing\nfrom what could be very satisfying events,\nor events that make us feel not so good\nbecause of things that\nwe did or took prior.\nSo I promise you it's going\nto be a vast discussion,\nbut I will structure it for you,\nand you'll come away\nwith a deep understanding\nof really what drives you.\nYou will also come away\nwith a lot of tools,\nhow to leverage dopamine so\nthat you can sustain energy,\ndrive and motivation for the things\nthat are important to you\nover long periods of time.\nBefore we dive into the\nmeat of today's discussion,\nI'd like to share with\nyou a fascinating result\nthat really underscores what dopamine\nis capable of in our brains and bodies,\nand underscores the fact\nthat just through behaviors,\nno drugs, nothing of that sort,\njust through behaviors,\nwe can achieve terrifically\nhigh increases in dopamine\nthat are very long and\nsustained in ways that serve us.\nThis is a result that was published\nin the European Journal of Physiology.\nI'll go into it in more detail later,\nbut essentially what it involved\nis having human subjects\nget into water of different temperatures.\nSo it was warm water,\nmoderately cool water\nand cold, cold water.\nHad them stay in that\nwater for up to an hour,\nand they measured by way of blood draw\nthings like cortisol,\nnorepinephrine and dopamine.\nWhat was fascinating is\nthat cold water exposure\nled to very rapid\nincreases in norepinephrine\nand epinephrine,\nwhich is also just called adrenaline.\nIt also led to increases in dopamine.\nAnd these increases in\ndopamine were very significant.\nThey kicked in around 10 or\n15 minutes after submersion\ninto the cold water.\nAnd I should mention the\nhead wasn't below water\nis just up to the neck.\nAnd the dopamine release continued to rise\nand rise and rise,\nand eventually reached\n250% above baseline.\nNow, what was interesting\nis after subjects got out\nof this cold water,\nthat dopamine increase was sustained.\nAnd I know nowadays many\npeople are interested\nin using cold water therapy as\na way to increase metabolism\nand fat loss,\nbut also to improve sense of well-being,\nimprove cognition,\nimprove clarity of mind.\nThere's something really\nspecial about this very alert,\nbut calm state of mind\nthat seems to be the one that's optimal\nfor pretty much everything except sleep,\nbut for all aspects of work\nand for social engagement\nand for sport that highly alert,\nbut calm state of mind\nreally is the sweet spot\nthat I believe most of\nus would like to achieve.\nAnd this cold water\nexposure done correctly\nreally can help people\nachieve that state of mind\nthrough these increases in dopamine\nthat lasts a very long time.\nSo I will later detail the\nspecifics of that study,\nwhat it entailed in terms of how long,\nthe variations, the different\nsubjects experienced,\nas well as how to limit the\namount of stress hormone,\ncortisol, that's released as a consequence\nof the cold water.\nAnd we will also talk about\ncompounds, supplements\nthat people can take in order to increase\ntheir levels of dopamine\nshould they choose.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRoka makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nI've spent a lifetime\nworking on the visual system.\nAnd I can tell you that the visual system\nhas to go through a lot of work\nin order to main clarity of what you see\nwhen there are shadows,\nwhen you go into different\ntypes of indoor lighting,\nand so on.\nAnd a lot of glasses don't work well\nbecause you put them on,\nand then you're in bright\nlight and you can see fine,\nbut then you move into a shadow\nand then you have to take them\noff and they don't adjust,\nor they don't adjust quickly enough.\nWith Roka their eyeglasses\nand sunglasses are designed\nwith the visual system biology in mind.\nSo you always see things\nwith perfect clarity.\nThe glasses are also terrific\nbecause they're very lightweight,\nand they won't slip off your\nface if you're exercising,\nif you're running or biking.\nIn fact, they were\ndesigned for the purpose\nof being able to be worn\nwhile you're engaging\nin those sorts of activities\nor simply working at your desk.\nI happen to wear readers at night\nor when I drive or when I work,\nand I love their sunglasses\ncause I can wear them anywhere.\nAnd also the aesthetics of\ntheir sunglasses and eyeglasses\nare terrific.\nUnlike a lot of other performance glasses\nthat frankly make people\nlook like cyborgs.\nThe aesthetics on Roka's\nare really terrific.\nYou could wear them\nanywhere you'd like to go.\nIf you'd like to try Roka glasses,\nyou can go to

to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can also analyze your DNA to see\nwhat you ought to be\ndoing for your immediate\nand long-term health.\nWe hear a lot these\ndays about optimization,\noptimizing hormones,\noptimizing your metabolism,\noptimizing this, optimizing that,\nbut unless you know the\nmeasurements of metabolic factors,\nhormones and other things that\nare in your blood and DNA,\nyou don't know what to optimize.\nWith InsideTracker it makes\nall of that very easy.\nThey can come to your house to\ntake the blood and DNA test,\nor you can go to a nearby clinic.\nThey send you the information\nand you take those results.\nAnd unlike a lot of laboratories\ndoing blood work out there\nand DNA tests,\nthey have a simple platform, a dashboard\nthat walks you through your results\nand helps you identify\nwhat sorts of nutritional\nor behavioral or other types of practices\nyou might want to\nincorporate into your life\nin order to positively\nimpact your immediate\nand long-term health.\nIt's a very easy system to use,\nand you will gain a ton of

studies\nand has over 600,005 star reviews.\nI've been meditating for a long time,\nbut I confess sometimes I meditate\nand sometimes I'm very\ninconsistent about my meditation.\nIdeally, I would meditate\nevery day for 20 or 30 minutes,\nbut what I found over the years is that,\nI'll start a meditation practice\nand then as life gets\nmore stressful or busier,\nwhich is exactly when I\nneed to meditate more,\nI tend to meditate less often.\nSwitching over to Headspace\nas a meditation app\nreally helped me stay consistent\nwith my meditation practice.\nAnd that's because they have\na huge range of meditations\nto select from.\nSome are short, some are longer.\nAnd in general, I try and\nget 20 minutes of meditation\nin every day,\nbut some days it's just five minutes\nand they have some terrific\njust five minute meditations.\nThe science says that even\na five minute meditation\ncan be beneficial for\ndifferent aspects of our brain\nand body.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to\nwww.headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get one month as a free trial\nwith full library of meditations\nthat you can use in any situation.\nThis is the

announce that there's an event\nthat some of you may find very useful.\nThis is an event put on by Logitech\nthat I will be speaking at.\nIt's called Rethink Education,\nthe Biology of Learning\nReimagining Learning\nthrough Neuroscience.\nAnd at this event, I will be speaking,\nthere will be other speakers as well,\nand I will be talking\nabout neuroplasticity\nand its applications for\nteaching and for learning.\nI will describe what I call\nthe plasticity super protocol\nthat incorporates all of what\nwe know about rapid learning,\nefficient learning and the\nbest ways to teach and learn.\nIt's geared towards\neducators of all kinds.\nIt is zero cost.\nSo please feel free to sign up.\nThe event is September 30th,\n2021 at 3:00 p.m Eastern.\nYou can find the registration\nlink in the caption\nfor this episode.\nSo let's talk about dopamine.\nMost people have heard of dopamine,\nand we hear all the time\nnow about dopamine hits.\nBut actually there's no such\nthing as a dopamine hit.\nAnd actually the way that\nyour body uses dopamine\nis to have a baseline level of dopamine.\nMeaning an amount of\ndopamine that's circulating\nin your brain and body all the time.\nAnd that turns out to be\nimportant for how you feel\ngenerally, whether or not\nyou're in a good mood,\nmotivated, et cetera.\nAnd you also can experience\npeaks in dopamine\nabove baseline.\nNow, this has a very specific name\nin the neurobiology literature,\nso-called tonic and phasic\nrelease of dopamine.\nAnd I'll explain what that\nmeans in a couple of minutes.\nBut if you remember nothing\nelse from this episode,\nplease remember this,\nthat when you experience\nsomething or you crave something\nreally desirable, really exciting\nto you, very pleasurable.\nWhat happens afterwards\nis your baseline level\nof dopamine drops.\nOkay?\nSo these peaks in dopamine,\nthey influence how much dopamine\nwill generally be circulating afterward.\nAnd you might think, oh, a big\npeak in dopamine after that,\nI'm going to feel even better\nbecause I just had this great event.\nNot the case.\nWhat actually happens is\nthat your baseline level\nof dopamine drops.\nAnd I will explain the\nprecise mechanism for that.\nOkay?\nIn the neuroscience literature,\nwe refer to this as tonic and\nphasic release of dopamine.\nTonic being the low level baseline\nthat's always there circulating,\nreleased into your brain all the time.\nAnd then phasic these peaks\nthat ride above that baseline.\nAnd those two things interact.\nAnd this is really important.\nI'm going to teach you the\nunderlying neurobiology,\nbut even if you have no\nbackground in biology,\nI promise to make it all clear.\nI'll explain the terms and what they mean.\nAnd I'm excited to teach\nyou about dopamine,\nbecause dopamine has everything\nto do with how you feel\nright now as you're listening to this,\nit has everything to do\nwith how you will feel\nan hour from now,\nhas everything to do with\nyour level of motivation\nand your level of desire,\nand your willingness\nto push through effort.\nIf ever you've interacted with somebody\nwho just doesn't seem to have\nany drive they've given up,\nor if you've interacted with somebody\nwho seems to have\nendless drive and energy,\nwhat you are looking at there\nin those two circumstances\nis without question a difference\nin the level of dopamine\ncirculating in their system.\nThere will be other factors too,\nbut the level of dopamine\nis the primary determinant\nof how motivated we\nare, how excited we are,\nhow outward facing we are\nand how willing we are,\nto lean into life and pursue things.\nDopamine is what we call a neuromodulator.\nNeuromodulators are different\nthan neurotransmitters.\nNeurotransmitters are\ninvolved in the dialogue\nbetween neurons nerve cells.\nAnd neurotransmitters tend to\nmediate local communication.\nJust imagine two people talking\nto one another at a concert,\nthat communication\nbetween them is analogous\nto the communication carried\nout by neurotransmitters,\nwhereas neuromodulators\ninfluence the communication\nof many neurons.\nImagine a bunch of people dancing\nwhere it's a coordinated\ndance involving 10 or 20\nor hundreds of people.\nNeuromodulators are\ncoordinating that dance.\nIn the nervous system\nwhat this means is that,\ndopamine release changes the probability\nthat certain neural\ncircuits will be active\nand that other neural\ncircuits will be inactive.\nOkay?\nSo it modulates a bunch\nof things all at once,\nand that's why it's so\npowerful at shifting\nnot just our levels of energy,\nbut also our mindset,\nalso our feelings of\nwhether or not we can,\nor cannot accomplish something.\nSo how does dopamine\nwork and what does it do?\nWell, first of all, it is not\njust responsible for pleasure,\nit is responsible for\nmotivation and drive.\nPrimarily, at the psychological level,\nalso for craving.\nThose three things are sort of the same.\nMotivation, drive and craving.\nIt also controls time perception,\nand we will get deep into how dopamine\ncan modulate time perception,\nand how important it is\nthat everybody be able\nto access increases in dopamine\nat different timescales.\nThis turns out to be important\nto not end up addicted\nto substances,\nbut it also turns out to be\nvery important to sustain effort\nand be a happy person\nover long periods of time.\nWhich I think most everybody wants.\nIt certainly is adaptive in\nlife to be able to do that.\nDopamine is also vitally\nimportant for movement.\nI'll explain the neural circuits\nfor dopamine and mindset,\nand dopamine in movement in a moment,\nbut in diseases like Parkinson's\nor Lewy bodies dementia,\nwhich is similar to\nParkinson's in many ways.\nThere's a depletion or\ndeath of dopamine neurons\nat a particular location in the brain\nwhich leads to shaky movements,\nchallenges and speaking,\nchallenges in particular\nin initiating movement.\nAnd because dopamine is depleted elsewhere\nto people with Parkinson's and Lew's bod,\nexcuse me, Lewy body dementia\nalso experience drops\nin motivation and affect, meaning mood.\nThey tend to get depressed and so on.\nWhen those people are properly treated,\nthey can, not always,\nbut they can recover some\nfluidity of movement,\nsome ability to initiate movement.\nAnd almost without question,\nthose people feel better psychologically,\nnot just because they can move,\nbut also because dopamine\nimpacts mood and motivation.\nSo what are the underlying\nneural circuits?\nFor those of you that are\nnot interested in biology\nand specific nomenclature,\nyou can tune out now if you want,\nbut it's actually pretty straightforward.\nYou have two main neural\ncircuits in the brain\nthat dopamine uses in order\nto exert all its effects.\nThe first one is a pathway\nthat goes from this area\nin the what's called\nthe ventral tegmentum.\nThat's a fancy, but\nventral just means bottom,\nand tegmentum actually means floor.\nSo it's at the bottom of the brain,\nand it's the ventral part of the floor.\nSo it's really low in\nthe back of the brain,\nthe ventral tegmentum.\nAnd it goes from the ventral tegmentum\nto what's called the ventral striatum\nand the prefrontal cortex.\nNow, that's a lot of language,\nbut basically what we call this is the,\nmesocorticolimbic pathway.\nThis is the pathway by which\ndopamine influences motivation,\ndrive and craving.\nIt involves structures that\nsome of you may have heard\nof before.\nThings like nucleus accumbens\nand the prefrontal cortex.\nThis is the pathway that\nreally gets disrupted\nin addictions where in\nparticular drugs that influence\nthe release of dopamine like\ncocaine and methamphetamine.\nWe'll talk about those drugs today.\nThey tap into this pathway.\nBut if you are pursuing a partner,\na boyfriend or girlfriend,\nif you're pursuing a degree in school,\nif you're pursuing a\nfinish line in a race,\nyou are tapping into this so-called\nmesecorticolimbic pathway.\nThis is the classic reward\npathway in all mammals.\nThe other pathway emerges\nfrom an area in the brain\ncalled the substantia nigra.\nSo-called because the cells\nin that area are dark,\nand the substantia nigra\nconnects to an area of the brain\ncalled the dorsal striatum.\nThis is not surprisingly called\nthe nigrostriatal pathway.\nFor those of you who have\nnever done any neuroanatomy,\nI'm going to teach you a\nlittle trick right now.\nEverything in neuroanatomy,\nthe first part of a word tells\nyou where the neurons are.\nAnd then the second part tells you\nwhere they are connecting to.\nSo when I say nigropstriatal pathway,\nit means that the neurons\nare in substantial nigra\nand they connect to the\nstriatum, nigrostriatal pathway.\nSo while it's a lot of language\nthere, some logic there.\nOkay?\nSo we've got these two pathways.\nOne, mainly for movement, right?\nThis is the substantia\nnigra to dorsal striatum.\nAnd we've got this other pathway,\nthe so-called mesocorticolimbic pathway,\nthat's for reward,\nreinforcement and motivation.\nI want you to remember that\nthere are two pathways.\nIf you don't remember the\ntwo pathways in detail,\nthat's fine.\nBut please remember that\nthere are two pathways,\nbecause that turns out\nto be important later.\nNow, the other thing to\nunderstand about dopamine is that,\nthe way that dopamine is\nreleased in the brain and body\ncan differ.\nMeaning it can be very local,\nor it can be more broad.\nNow, most of you have\nprobably heard of synapses.\nSynapses are the little\nspaces between neurons,\nand basically neurons\nnerve cells communicate\nwith one another by making\neach other electrically active,\nor by making each other\nless electrically active.\nSo here's how this works.\nYou can imagine one nerve\ncell and another nerve cell\nwith a little gap between them,\na little synapse.\nAnd the way that one nerve cell causes\nthe next nerve cell to fire.\nWhat we call fire really means\nto become electrically active\nis that it vomits out\nthese little packets,\nwhat we call vesicles.\nThey're little bubbles\nfilled with a chemical,\nwhen that chemical enters the synapse,\nit some of it docks or\nparks on the other side,\nin the other neuron.\nAnd by virtue of\nelectrical changes in the,\nwhat we call the postsynaptic neuron,\nthat chemical will make that\nneuron more electrically active\nor less electrically active.\nDopamine can do that like\nany other neurotransmitter\nor neuromodulator.\nSo it can have one neuron\ninfluence another neuron.\nBut dopamine can also engage\nin what's called a volume metric release.\nVolumetric release is like a\ngiant vomit that gets out to 50\nor a hundred or even thousands of cells.\nSo there's local release what\nwe call synaptic release,\nand then there's volumetric release.\nSo volumetric release is like\ndumping all this dopamine out\ninto the system.\nSo dopamine is incredible\nbecause it can change the way\nthat our neural circuits\nwork at a local scale\nand at a very broad scale.\nAnd for those of you that\nare only interested in tools,\nlike how do I get more dopamine?\nLet me tell you this\npart is really important\nbecause if you were to\ntake a drug or supplement\nthat increases your level of dopamine,\nyou are influencing both the\nlocal release of dopamine\nand volumetric release.\nThis relates back to\nthe baseline of dopamine\nand the big peak above baseline.\nAnd that turns out to be important.\nAnd I'll just allude\nto why it's important.\nMany drugs and indeed many supplements\nthat increase dopamine will\nactually make it harder\nfor you to sustain dopamine release\nover long periods of time.\nAnd to achieve those peaks\nthat most of us are craving\nwhen we are in pursuit of things.\nWhy?\nBecause if you get both\nvolume metric release,\nthe dumping out of dopamine everywhere,\nand you're getting local release,\nwhat it means is that the\ndifference between the peak\nand baseline is likely to be smaller.\nAnd this is very important,\nhow satisfying or exciting or pleasureful\na given experience is,\ndoesn't just depend on\nthe height of that peak,\nit depends on the height\nof that peak relative\nto the baseline.\nSo if you increase the baseline\nand you increase the peak,\nyou're not going to achieve\nmore and more pleasure\nfrom things.\nI'll talk about how to\nleverage this information\nin a little bit,\nbut just increasing your dopamine.\nYes, it will make you\nexcited for all things.\nIt will make you feel very motivated,\nbut it will also make that\nmotivation very short-lived.\nSo there's a better way\nto increase your dopamine.\nThere's a better way to optimize\nthis peak to baseline ratio.\nFor now what we've talked about\nis two main neural circuits,\none for movement,\nand one for motivation\nand craving with dopamine.\nAnd we've talked about two\nmain modes of communication\nbetween neurons with dopamine.\nOne is this local synaptic release.\nOne is more volume metric release.\nAnd in the back of your mind,\nyou can relate this back to,\nagain, this baseline versus\npeaks above baseline.\nSo that's a description\nof what we would call\nthe spatial effects or the\nspatial aspects of dopamine.\nI said this connects to that,\nthat connects to this.\nYou can get local or more\nbroad volumetric release.\nWhat about the duration of release\nor the duration of action for dopamine?\nWell, dopamine is unique\namong chemicals in the brain,\nbecause dopamine unlike a\nlot of chemicals in the brain\nworks through what are called\nG protein-coupled receptors.\nAnd for those of you that\nare about to pass out\nfrom the amount of detail,\njust hang in there with me.\nIt's really not complicated.\nThere are two ways that\nneurons can communicate\nor mainly two ways.\nThere are third and fourth,\nbut mostly neurons\ncommunicate by two modes.\nOne, are what we call\nfast electrical synapses\nionotropic conduction.\nAll right?\nYou don't need to know what that means,\nbut basically one neuron\nactivates another neuron\nand little holes open up in that neuron,\nand ions rush in.\nSodium is the main ion salt\nby which one neuron influences\nthe electrical activity\nof another neuron because\nsodium ions contain a charge.\nOkay?\nThere are other things like\nchloride and potassium.\nIf you're interested in looking this up,\njust look up ionic conductances\nin the action potential,\nor I could do a post on it some time\nand we could go into detail.\nBut just understand that when neurons\nwant to influence each other,\nthey can do it by way of this\nfast ionotropic conduction.\nThis is a really quick way for one neuron\nto influence the next.\nDopamine doesn't communicate that way.\nDopamine is slower.\nIt works through what are\ncalled G protein-coupled\nreceptors.\nSo what happens is dopamine is released\nin these little vesicles\nthat I've mentioned before,\nget vomited out into the synapse.\nSome of that dopamine will bind\nto the so-called postsynaptic neuron,\nit'll bind to the next neuron,\nand then it sets off a cascade.\nIt's kind of like a bucket\nbrigade of one thing,\ngetting handed off to the next,\nto the next, to the next.\nIt's G protein-coupled receptors.\nAnd anytime you hear about these GPCRs\nor G protein-coupled receptors,\npay attention because\nthey're really interesting.\nThey're slow,\nbut they also can have\nmultiple cascades of effects.\nThey can impact even gene\nexpression at some level.\nThey can change what a\ncell actually becomes.\nThey can change how well\nor how poorly that cell\nwill respond to the same\nsignal in the future.\nSo dopamine works through\nthe slower process.\nThese G protein-coupled receptors.\nAnd so its effects tend to\ntake a while in order to occur.\nThis aspect of dopamine\ntransmission is important\nbecause it now underscores two things.\nOne, there's two pathways\nfor dopamine to communicate.\nOne for movement,\none for motivation and craving.\nThere's two spatial scales\nat which dopamine can operate\nsynaptically or volumetrically.\nAnd dopamine can have slow effects,\nreally slow effects,\nor even very long lasting effects.\nAnd it even can control gene expression.\nIt can actually change\nthe way that cells behave.\nOne thing that's not often\ndiscussed about dopamine,\nbut is extremely important to know\nis that dopamine doesn't work on its own.\nNeurons that release dopamine\nco-release glutamate.\nGlutamate is a neurotransmitter\nand it's a neurotransmitter\nthat is excitatory,\nmeaning it stimulates neurons\nto be electrically active.\nSo now even if you don't\nknow any cell biology,\nyou should start to gain a picture\nthat dopamine is responsible for movement,\nmotivation and drive.\nIt does that through two pathways,\nbut also the dopamine\nstimulates action in general,\nbecause it releases this\nexcitatory neurotransmitter.\nIt tends to make certain\nneurons that are nearby\nor even that are far away,\nbecause of volumetric release,\nit tends to make those more active.\nSo dopamine is really stimulating.\nAnd indeed we say that\ndopaminergic transmission\nor dopamine tends to\nstimulate sympathetic arousal.\nSympathetic doesn't have\nanything to do with sympathy.\nIt's just simply means that it tends\nto increase our levels of alertness.\nIt tends to bring an animal or a human\ninto a state of more alertness, readiness\nand desire to pursue\nthings outside the confines\nof its skin.\nSo if I were to just put\na really simple message\naround dopamine it would be,\nthere's a molecule in your brain and body\nthat when released tends to\nmake you look outside yourself,\npursue things outside yourself,\nand to crave things outside yourself.\nThe pleasure that arrives\nfrom achieving things\nalso involves dopamine,\nbut is mainly the consequences\nof other molecules.\nBut if ever you felt\nlethargic and like just lazy\nand you had no motivation or drive,\nthat's a low dopamine state.\nIf ever you felt really\nexcited, motivated,\neven if you're a little\nscared to do something.\nMaybe you did your first skydive,\nor you're about to do your first skydive,\nor you're about to do some public speaking\nand you really don't want to screw it up,\nyou are in a high dopamine state.\nDopamine is a universal\ncurrency in all mammals,\nbut especially in humans\nfor moving us toward goals\nand how much dopamine is in\nour system at any one time\ncompared to how much\ndopamine was in our system\na few minutes ago,\nand how much we remember\nenjoying a particular experience\nof the past.\nThat dictates your\nso-called quality of life\nand your desire to pursue things.\nThis is really important.\nDopamine is a currency,\nand it's the way that you track pleasure.\nIt's the way that you track success.\nIt's the way that you track\nwhether or not you are\ndoing well or doing poorly.\nAnd that is subjective,\nbut if your dopamine is too low,\nyou will not feel motivated.\nIf your dopamine is really high,\nyou will feel motivated.\nAnd if your dopamine is\nsomewhere in the middle,\nhow you feel depends on whether or not\nyou had higher dopamine a few\nminutes ago or lower dopamine.\nThis is important,\nyour experience of life and\nyour level of motivation\nand drive depends on how much\ndopamine you have relative\nto your recent experience.\nThis is again, something\nthat's just not accounted\nfor in the simple\nlanguage of dopamine hits.\nOkay?\nA simple way to envision dopamine hits\nis every time you do something you like,\nyou to piece of chocolate,\ndopamine hit.\nYou look at your Instagram,\ndopamine hit.\nYou see someone you like,\ndopamine hit.\nAll these things\ndescribed as dopamine hits\nneglect the fact that if\nyou scroll social media\nand you see something you really like,\ndopamine hit.\nSure there's an increase in dopamine,\nbut then you get to\nsomething else and you go,\nhmm, not that interesting.\nHowever, had you arrived\nat that second thing first,\nyou might think that it\nwas really interesting.\nIf you had arrived to\nthat second Instagram post\nthree days later or four days later,\nyou might find it extremely interesting.\nAgain, how much dopamine you\nexperience from something\ndepends on your baseline level of dopamine\nwhen you arrive there,\nand your previous dopamine peaks.\nOkay?\nThat's super important to understand,\nand it's completely neglected\nby the general language\nof dopamine hits.\nThis is why when you\nrepeatedly engage in something\nthat you enjoy,\nyour threshold for enjoyment\ngoes up and up and up.\nSo I want to talk about that process.\nAnd I want to explain\nhow that process works,\nbecause if you understand that process,\nand you understand some of\nthese schedules and kinetics\nas we call them around dopamine,\nyou will be in a terrific position\nto use any dopamine enhancing\ntools that you decide to use.\nYou'll be in an excellent\nposition to modulate\nand control your own dopamine release\nfor optimal motivation and drive.\nI realized that was a lot of information\nabout the biology of dopamine,\nsort of like trying to make you drink\nfrom the fire hose of dopamine biology.\nHowever, I realized that some people\nprobably want even more information\nabout the biology of\ndopamine transmission.\nIf you're interested in that,\nI'll post a link to a\nabsolutely stellar review\nthat was published in\nNature Reviews Neuroscience\ncalled spatial and temporal\nscales of dopamine transmission.\nIt is quite detailed,\nbut they have beautiful diagrams\nand can walk you through all the things\nthat I just described and\nget into even more detail.\nWe'll put a link to that\nin the caption on YouTube.\nRight now, I want to share\nwith you two anecdotes,\none from my own life,\nand one from some fairly recent history\nthat illustrate some of the\ncore biology of dopamine\nand how profoundly it\ncan shape our experience.\nThe first one is a really\ntragic situation that occurred.\nThis was in the 80s,\nthere was a outbreak of what\nlooked like Parkinsonian\nsymptoms in a young population.\nSo many of you heard\nof Parkinson's disease.\nParkinson's disease is a disease\nin which people initially\nstart to quake, can't\ngenerate smooth movements,\nthey'll have issues with speech,\nsometimes cognition as well.\nThere are examples like Michael J. Fox,\nwhich are kind of early onset.\nParkinson's typically it hits people\na little bit later in life.\nThere's a genetic component.\nBut there is this question,\nand there's always been this question\nwhether or not certain lifestyle factors\ncan also create Parkinson's?\nAnd some years ago there was a situation\nwhere street laboratories,\nillicit laboratories were\ntrying to make a drug\ncalled MPPP, which is an\nopioid light compound.\nIt's a bit like heroin,\nand heroin addicts seeking\nheroin went out and bought\nwhat they thought was MPPP.\nUnfortunately, it was not MPPP.\nI mean, it would have been\ntragic if it was anyway\nbecause they were drug addicts,\nbut what they ended up taking\nturned out to be a lot worse.\nWhat they ended up taking was MPTP,\nand MPTP can arise in\nthe synthesis of MPPP.\nSo someone in a lab someplace,\nthis was mainly in the\nCentral Valley in California,\nbut elsewhere as well.\nSomebody created MPTP,\nand what ended up happening\nwas a large number\nof young people who were opioid addicts\nbecame completely boxed in paralyzed.\nCouldn't speak, couldn't blink,\ncouldn't do anything.\nCouldn't function, couldn't move.\nSo both aspects of dopamine\ntransmission were disrupted.\nThey had no motivation and drive.\nThey couldn't generate\nany movement of any kind.\nThey were literally locked in frozen.\nAnd sadly, this is irreversible.\nIt's irreversible,\nbecause what MPTP does is it\nkills the dopaminergic neurons\nof the substantia nigra\nthat nigrostriatal pathway\nthat's involved in generating movement.\nAnd it kills the dopaminergic neurons\nof the so-called\nmesocorticolimbic pathway.\nI was in college when this\nwhole MPTP thing happened.\nAnd I remember hearing this story.\nAt the time, I had no understanding\nof what it is to have very\nhigh levels of dopamine\nor extremely depleted levels of dopamine.\nThere was no reason why I\nshould have that understanding.\nI mean, of course I had\nexperienced different pleasures\nof different kinds and\nI've had lows in my life,\nbut nothing to the extreme\nthat I'm about to discuss.\nI got Giardia.\nAnd Giardia is a stomach bug\nthat if any of you ever had it,\nit is terrible.\nIt's terrible diarrhea.\nYou end up very dehydrated very quickly.\nYou drop a ton of weight and\nit is extremely unpleasant.\nI ended up going to the emergency room,\nand in the emergency room,\nI begged them for something\nto stop up my guts.\nAnd they gave it to me.\nThey put a saline line into rehydrate me\nand they injected something\ninto the saline bag.\nAnd within minutes I felt more sadness,\nmore overwhelming sense of depression,\nbasically, lower than I'd\never felt in my entire life.\nIt was absolutely profound.\nI was crying endlessly without\nknowing why I was crying.\nI was miserable.\nAnd I asked them, what did you inject?\nAnd they said, \"We injected Thorazine.\"\nThorazine is an antipsychotic drug.\nIt's actually used to\nblock dopamine receptors.\nIt's what's given to people\nwho have schizophrenia.\nOften is given to people\nwho have schizophrenia,\nbecause schizophrenia\ninvolves among other things\nelevated levels of dopamine.\nIt was horrible.\nThe experience of it was miserable,\nunlike anything I'd ever experienced.\nAnd so I actually said to them,\n\"What did you give me?\"\nThey said, \"Thorazine.\"\nAnd I said, \"You have to give me l-DOPA.\n\"You have to give me something\nto get my dopamine levels\n\"back up again.\"\nAnd they did.\nThey gave me an injection\nof l-DOPA into the bag,\nwent straight to my bloodstream.\nAnd within minutes I felt fine again.\nIt was incredible.\nAnd it really opened up\nmy mind and my experience\nto what it is to have\nabsolutely plummeted levels\nof dopamine.\nAnd there's nothing more\nmiserable than that I'll tell you.\nAnd these poor souls who\nhad this MPTP experience,\nunfortunately, they couldn't\nrecover those cells.\nPeople who have severe Parkinson's\nare struggling with this as well,\nbecause in Parkinson's\nand in Lewy body dementia,\nthe dopaminergic neurons often die.\nIt's not just a problem with those neurons\nreleasing enough dopamine.\nLater, we're going to\ntalk about some approaches\nto maintaining dopaminergic neuron health\nand things that we can all do for that.\nBut I will tell you these dopamine neurons\nthat we all have are very\nprecious for movement\nand mood and motivation.\nHaving experienced what it is\nto have very, very low levels\nof dopamine or in this case\nto have my dopamine receptors\nblocked from Thorazine was\neye-opening to say the least,\nand has given me tremendous\nsensitivity to the fact\nthat dopamine is perhaps one\nof the most powerful molecules\nthat any of us has inside of us.\nAnd the one that we ought to\nall think very carefully about\nhow we leverage,\nbecause while most\nexperiences and most things\nthat we do, and take and eat and cetera,\nwon't create enormous highs\nand enormous lows in dopamine.\nEven subtle fluctuations\nin dopamine really shape\nour perception of life\nand what we're capable of,\nand how we feel.\nAnd so we want to guard those\nand we want to understand them.\nSo let's lean into that\nunderstanding about dopamine.\nAnd then let's talk about some tools\nthat we can all use to leverage dopamine\nin order to keep that\nbaseline in the appropriate,\nhealthy place,\nand still be able to access\nthose peaks in dopamine.\nBecause those, after all are\nsome of what makes life rich\nand worth living.\nSo let's talk about the\nbaseline of dopamine\nthat we all have and the peaks in dopamine\nthat we all can achieve\nthrough different activities\nand things that we ingest.\nAll of us have different\nbaseline levels of dopamine.\nSome of this is sure to be genetic.\nSome people just simply ride\nat a level a little bit higher.\nThey're a little bit more excited,\nthey're a little bit more motivated,\nor maybe they're a lot more\nexcited or a lot more motivated.\nSome people are a little mellower,\nsome people are a little less excitable.\nAnd some of that has to do with the fact\nthat dopamine doesn't act alone.\nDopamine has close cousins or\nfriends in the nervous system.\nAnd I'll just name off a\nfew of those close cousins\nand friends.\nEpinephrin also called adrenaline\nis the main chemical driver of energy.\nWe can't do anything, anything at all,\nunless we have some level of epinephrin\nin our brain and body.\nIt's released from the adrenal glands\nwhich right on top our kidneys.\nIt's released from an\narea of the brainstem\ncalled locus coeruleus.\nAnd its release tends to\nwake up neural circuits\nin the brain and wake up various aspects\nof our body's physiology\nand give us a readiness.\nSo it should come as no surprise\nthat dopamine and\nepinephrin aka adrenaline\nhang out together.\nIn fact, epinephrin and adrenaline\nare actually manufactured\nfrom dopamine.\nThere's a biochemical\npathway involving dopamine\nwhich is a beautiful pathway.\nIf ever you want to look it up,\nyou can just look up\nbiochemistry of dopamine.\nBut what you'll find is that,\nl-DOPA is converted into dopamine.\nDopamine is converted\nto two noradrenaline.\nNorepinephrin, it's also called.\nAnd noredrenaline,\nnorepinephrin is converted\ninto adrenaline.\nSo not only are dopamine and\nepinephrin aka adrenaline\nclose cousins,\nthey are actually family members.\nOkay?\nThey're closely related.\nI'm not going to get too\ndeep into epinephrin today.\nI'm not going to talk too\nmuch about those pathways,\nbut anytime I'm talking about\ndopaminergic transmission\nor that you have a peak in dopamine,\ninevitably, that means\nthat you have a peak\nand release of epinephrin as well.\nWhat dopamine does is\ndopamine really colors\nthe subjective experience of an activity\nto make it more pleasureful,\nto make it something\nthat you want more of.\nEpinephrin is more about energy.\nEpinephrin alone can be\nfear, paralysis, trauma.\nNot physical paralysis,\nbut mental paralysis,\nyou know, frozen in fear or\nbeing traumatized or scared.\nBut the addition of dopamine\nto that chemical cocktail,\nif dopamine is released in the brain,\nwell, then that epinephrin\nbecomes one of excitement.\nOkay?\nI'm using a broad brush here,\nbut essentially what you\nneed to know is that,\ndopamine and epinephrin aka\nadrenaline are family members.\nAnd they tend to work\ntogether like a little gang\nto make you seek out certain things.\nSo what sorts of activities?\nWhat sorts of things increase dopamine?\nAnd how much do they increase dopamine?\nWell, let's take a look\nat some typical things\nthat people do out there\nor ingest out there\nthat are known to increase dopamine.\nSo let's recall that you have\na baseline level of dopamine\nand that everybody does.\nAnd even within a family,\nyou might have family members\nwho are very excitable,\nhappy and motivated,\nand others who are less\nexcitable, happy and motivated.\nBut your level of dopamine has everything\nto do with those genetics,\nbut also with what you've\nexperienced in the previous days\nand the previous months and so on.\nWhen you do or ingest certain things,\nyour levels of dopamine\nwill rise above baseline\ntransiently.\nAnd depending on what you do or ingest,\nit will rise either more or less,\nand it will be very brief\nor a last a long time.\nSo let's take a look at\nsome of the typical things\nthat people take and do and eat.\nSome are good for us,\nsome are not good for us.\nAnd let's ask how much dopamine\nis increased above baseline?\nNow, of course, these are averages,\nbut these are averages\nthat have been measured\nin so-called micro dialysis\nstudies in animals.\nSo actually extracting\nfrom particular brain areas\nhow much dopamine is released?\nOr from measuring the serum,\nthe circulating levels\nof dopamine in humans.\nChocolate.\nThey didn't look at milk\nversus dark chocolate.\nBut chocolate will increase\nyour baseline level of dopamine\n1.5 times.\nOkay?\nSo it's a pretty substantial\nincrease in dopamine.\nIt's transient.\nIt goes away after a few\nminutes or even a few seconds.\nI'll explain what determines\nthe duration in a minute.\nBut 1.5 times for chocolate.\nSex.\nBoth the pursuit of sex and the act of sex\nincreases dopamine two times.\nSo it's a doubling above baseline.\nNow, of course, there's\ngoing to be variation there,\nbut that's the average\nincrease in baseline dopamine\ncaused by sex.\nLater, I will talk about\nhow the different aspects\nof the so-called arousal art,\nthe different aspects of sex,\nbelieve it or not have a\ndifferential impact on dopamine.\nBut for now as a general\ntheme or activity,\nsex doubles the amount\nof dopamine circulating\nin your blood.\nNicotine.\nIn particular, nicotine that is smoked\nlike cigarettes and so forth,\nincreases dopamine two and\na half times above baseline.\nSo there's a peak that\ngoes up above baseline\ntwo and a half times higher.\nIt is very short-lived.\nAnyone who's ever been a chain smoker\nor observed a chain smoker understands\nthat the increase in\ndopamine from nicotine\nis very short-lived.\nCocaine will increase\nthe level of dopamine\nin the bloodstream two and\na half times above baseline.\nAnd amphetamine another\ndrug that increases dopamine\nwill increase the amount of\ndopamine in the bloodstream\n10 times above baseline.\nA tremendous increase in dopamine.\nExercise.\nNow, exercise will have a different impact\non the levels of dopamine,\ndepending on how much\nsomebody subjectively enjoys\nthat exercise.\nSo if you're somebody who loves running,\nchances are it's going to\nincrease your levels of dopamine\ntwo times above your baseline,\nnot unlike sex.\nPeople who dislike exercise will achieve\nless dopamine increase or\nno increase in dopamine\nfrom exercise.\nAnd if you like other\nforms of exercise like yoga\nor weightlifting or\nswimming or what have you.\nAgain, it's going to vary by\nyour subjective experience\nof whether or not you enjoy that activity.\nThis is important.\nAnd it brings us back to something\nthat we talked about earlier.\nRemember that mesocorticolimbic pathway?\nWell, the cortical part is important.\nThe cortical part actually\nhas a very specific part,\nwhich is your prefrontal cortex.\nThe area of your forebrain\nthat's involved in thinking\nand planning and involved in assigning\na rational explanation to something,\nand involved in assigning\na subjective experience\nto something, right?\nSo for instance, the pen\nthat I'm holding right now,\nit's one of these Pilot V5s.\nI love these Pilot V5s.\nThey don't sponsor the podcast.\nI just happen to like them.\nI liked the way that they write,\nhow they feel.\nIf I spent enough time thinking about it,\nor talking about it,\nI could probably get a dopamine increase\njust talking about this Pilot V5.\nAnd that's not because\nI have the propensity\nto release dopamine easily,\nit's that as we start\nto engage with something\nmore and more and what we say about it,\nand what we encourage\nourselves to think about it,\nhas a profound impact on its rewarding\nor non rewarding properties.\nNow, it's not simply the case\nthat you can lie to yourself,\nand you can tell yourself I love something\nand when you don't really love it,\nand it will increase dopamine.\nBut what's been found over and over again,\nis that if people journal about something\nor they practice some form of\nappreciation for something,\nor they think of some aspect\nof something that they enjoy,\nthe amount of dopamine that\nthat behavior will evoke\ntends to go up.\nSo for people that hate exercise,\nyou can think about\nsome aspect of exercise\nthat you really enjoy.\nHowever, I will caution you\nagainst saying to yourself,\nI hate exercise or I hate\nstudying or I hate this person,\nbut I love the reward I\ngive myself afterward.\nLater, we're going to talk about\nhow rewards given afterward\nactually make the situation worse.\nThey won't make you like\nexercise more or study more,\nthey actually will undermine\nthe dopamine release\nthat would otherwise\noccur for that activity.\nSo certain things chemicals\nhave a universal effect.\nThey make everybody's dopamine go up.\nSo some people like chocolate,\nsome people don't of course,\nbut in general, it make has causes\nthis increase in dopamine.\nBut sex, nicotine, cocaine, amphetamine,\nthose things cause increases in dopamine\nand everybody that takes them.\nThings like exercise, studying, hard work,\nworking through a\nchallenge in a relationship\nor working through\nsomething hard of any kind\nthat is going to be subjective\nas to how much dopamine will be released.\nAnd we will return to\nthat subjective component\nin a little bit.\nBut now you have a sense\nof how much dopamine\ncan be evoked by different activities\nand by different substances.\nOne that you might be\nwondering about is caffeine.\nI'm certainly drinking my caffeine today,\nand I do enjoy caffeine\nin limited quantities.\nI drink yerba mate and I\ndrink coffee and I love it.\nDoes it increase dopamine?\nWell, a little bit.\nCaffeine will increase\ndopamine to some extent,\nbut it is pretty modest\ncompared to the other things\nthat I described.\nChocolate, sex, nicotine,\ncocaine, amphetamine and so on.\nHowever, there's a\nreally interesting paper\npublished in 2015.\nThis is Volkow et al.\nYou can look up it's very easy to find.\nThat showed that regular\ningestion of caffeine,\nwhether or not it's from\ncoffee or otherwise,\nincreases up regulation of\ncertain dopamine receptors.\nSo caffeine actually makes\nyou able to experience\nmore of dopamines effects.\nBecause as I mentioned before,\ndopamine is vomited out into the synapse\nor it's released volumetrically,\nbut then it has to bind someplace\nand trigger those G\nprotein-coupled receptors.\nAnd caffeine increases the number,\nthe density of those G\nprotein-coupled receptors.\nNow, sitting back and thinking about that,\nyou might think, oh yeah, you know,\nsometimes I'll notice people,\nat least in the old days\nthat used to be a cigarette\nand a cup of coffee.\nOr when people drink alcohol,\noftentimes they'll smoke.\nAnd it's well-known\nthat different compounds\nlike alcohol and nicotine\nor caffeine and nicotine\nor certain behaviors and\ncertain drugs can synergize\nto give bigger dopamine increases.\nAnd this is not terribly uncommon.\nThere are a lot of people nowadays\nwho for instance take\npre-workout energy drinks.\nThey'll drink,\nI won't name names,\nbut they'll drink a canned energy drink\nor they'll drink a pre-workout\nand they'll try and get\nthat big stimulation\nthat stimulant effect for the dopamine,\nthe norepinephrin, that\nfamily of molecules\nthat works together to make you motivated.\nAnd then they'll also exercise\nto try and get even more\nof a dopaminergic experience\nout of that workout.\nSometimes it's also to perform\nbetter as well, of course,\nbut as we'll talk about in a few minutes,\nthat aspect or that approach rather\nof trying to just get your dopamine\nas high as you possibly can,\nin order to get the\nmost out of experience,\nturns out to not be the best approach.\nAnd what you'll find as we\ntalk about dopamine schedules\nis that layering together multiple things,\nsubstances and activities\nthat lead to big increases in dopamine,\nactually can create pretty severe issues\nwith motivation and energy\nright after those experiences\nand even a couple of days later.\nSo I'm not saying that\npeople shouldn't take\nthe occasional pre-workout\nif that's your thing,\nor drink a cup of coffee\nor two before working out\nnow and again.\nSome people really enjoy that.\nI certainly do that every once in a while,\nbut if you do it too often,\nwhat you'll find is that your\ncapacity to release dopamine\nand your level of motivation\nand drive and energy overall\nwill take a serious hit.\nNow, I've been alluding\nto this dopamine peaks\nversus dopamine baseline things\nsince the beginning of the episode.\nI talked about tonic and\nphasic release and so forth.\nBut now let's really drill\ninto what this means,\nand how to leverage it\nfor our own purposes.\nIn order to do that, let's\ntake a step back and ask,\nwhy would we have a\ndopamine system like this?\nWhy would we have a\ndopamine system at all?\nWell, we have to remember\nwhat our species primary\ninterest is?\nOur species like all\nspecies has a main interest,\nand that's to make more of itself.\nAnd it's just about sex and reproduction.\nIt's about forging for resources.\nResources can be food,\nit can be water can be salt,\nit can be shelter,\nit can be social connection.\nDopamine is the universal\ncurrency of forging and seeking,\nright?\nWe call sometimes talk about\nmotivation and craving,\nbut what we mean in the\nevolutionary adaptive context,\nwhat we mean is forging and seeking.\nSeeking water, seeking\nfood, seeking mates.\nSeeking things that make us feel good\nand avoiding things that\ndon't make us feel good.\nBut in particular seeking things\nthat will provide sustenance\nand pleasure in the short-term\nand will extend the\nspecies in the long-term.\nOnce we understand that\ndopamine is a driver for us\nto seek things,\nit makes perfect sense as to why\nit would have a baseline\nlevel and it would have peaks.\nAnd that the baseline and\npeaks would be related\nin some sort of direct way.\nHere's what I mean by that.\nLet's say that you were not alive now,\nbut you were alive 10,000 years ago.\nAnd you woke up and you\nlooked and you realized\nyou had minimal water and\nyou had minimal food left.\nMaybe you have a child,\nmaybe you have a partner,\nmaybe you're in an entire village,\nbut you realize that you need things.\nOkay?\nYou need to be able to generate the energy\nto go seek those things.\nAnd chances are there were\ndangers in seeking those things.\nYes, it could be saber-tooth tigers\nand things of that sort,\nbut there are other dangers too.\nThere's the danger of a cut to your skin\nthat could lead to infection.\nThere's the danger of storms,\nthere's the danger of cold,\nthere's the danger of leaving\nyour loved ones behind.\nSo you go out and forage, right?\nYou could be hunting,\nyou could be gathering,\nor you could be doing both.\nThe going out and foraging process\nwas we are certain driven by dopamine.\nI mean, there's no fossil\nrecord of the brain,\nbut the circuits have existed.\nWe know for tens of thousands,\nif not hundreds of thousands of years.\nAnd they are present in every\nanimal, not just mammals,\nbut even in little worms like C. elegans,\nit's the same process.\nIt's mediated by dopamine.\nSo dopamine drives you to\ngo out and look for things.\nAnd then let's say you\nfind a couple berries,\nand these ones are rotten,\nthese ones are good.\nMaybe you hunt an animal and kill it,\nor you find an animal\nthat was recently killed\nand you decide to take the meat.\nYou are going to achieve,\nor I should say, experience\nsome sort of dopamine release.\nYou found the reward.\nThat's great.\nBut then it needs to\nreturn to some lower level.\nWhy?\nWell, because if you just stayed there,\nyou would never continue\nto forage for more.\nIt doesn't just increase your\nbaseline and then stay there.\nIt goes back down.\nAnd what's very important to understand\nis that it doesn't just go back down\nto the level it was before,\nit goes down to a level below\nwhat it was before you went\nout seeking that thing.\nNow, this is counter-intuitive.\nWe often think,\nOh, okay, I'm going to\npursue the win, right?\nLet's move this to modern day.\nI'm going to run this marathon,\nI'm going to train for this marathon.\nThen you run the marathon and you finish,\nyou cross the finish line,\nyou feel great.\nAnd you would think, okay, now\nI'm set for the entire year,\nI'm going to feel so much better,\nI'm going to feel this\naccomplishment in my body,\nit's going to be so great.\nThat's not what happens.\nYou might feel some of those things,\nbut your level of dopamine\nhas actually dropped\nbelow baseline.\nNow, eventually it will ratchet back up.\nBut two things are really important.\nFirst of all, the extent to\nwhich it drops below baseline\nis proportional to how high the peak was.\nSo if you cross the\nfinish line pretty happy,\nit won't drop that much\nbelow baseline afterward.\nIf you cross the finish line ecstatic,\nwell, a day or two later,\nyou're going to feel quite a bit lower\nthan you would otherwise.\nYou might not be depressed,\nbecause it depends on where\nthat baseline was to begin with.\nBut the so-called postpartum depression\nthat people experience after giving birth\nor after some big win a graduation\nor any kind of celebration\nthat postpartum drop\nin mood and affect and\nmotivation is the drop\nin baseline dopamine.\nThis is very important to understand,\nbecause this happens on\nvery rapid timescales\nand it can last quite a long time.\nIt also explains the\nbehavior that most of us\nare familiar with,\nof engaging in something\nthat we really enjoy.\nGoing to a restaurant\nthat we absolutely love,\nor engaging in some way with some person\nthat we really, really enjoy.\nBut if we continue to\nengage in that behavior\nover and over again,\nit kind of loses its edge.\nIt starts to kind of\nfeel less exciting to us.\nSome of us experienced that\ndrop in excitement more quickly\nand more severely than others,\nbut everyone experiences\nthat to some extent.\nAnd this has direct roots\nin these evolutionarily\nconserved circuits.\nSome of you may be hearing this and think,\nno, no, no, no that's\nnot how it works for me.\nI'm just riding higher\nand higher all the time.\nI love my kids,\nI love my job,\nI love school,\nI love wins,\nI don't want losses.\nI agree.\nWe all feel good when\nwe are achieving things,\nbut oftentimes we are feeling good\nbecause we are layering in\ndifferent aspects of life,\nconsuming things and doing things\nthat increase our dopamine.\nWe're getting those peaks,\nbut afterward the drop in baseline occurs,\nand it always takes a\nlittle while to get back\nto our stable baseline.\nWe really all have a sort\nof dopamine set point.\nAnd if we continue to\nindulge in the same behaviors\nor even different behaviors\nthat increase our dopamine\nin these big peaks over\nand over and over again,\nwe won't experience the same level of joy\nfrom those behaviors or\nfrom anything at all.\nNow, that has a name.\nIt's called addiction.\nBut even for people who aren't addicted,\neven for people don't an attachment\nto any specific substance or behavior,\nthis drop in bay below baseline\nafter any peak in dopamine\nis substantial.\nAnd it governs whether or not\nwe are going to feel motivated\nto continue to pursue other things.\nFortunately, there's a\nway to work with this,\nsuch that we can\nconstantly stay motivated,\nbut also keep that baseline of dopamine\nat an appropriate, healthy level.\nA previous guest on the\nHuberman Lab Podcast\nwas Dr. Anna Lembke.\nShe's head of the Addiction\nDual Diagnosis Clinic\nat Stanford.\nHas this amazing book,\n\"Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance\nin the Age of Indulgence\".\nIf you haven't read the book,\nI highly encourage you to check it out.\nIt's fantastic.\nThe other terrific book about dopamine\nis the \"Molecule of More\",\nwhich is a similar in some regard,\nbut isn't so much about addiction,\nit's more about other types of behaviors.\nBoth books really focus on\nthese dopamine schedules\nand the relationship between these peaks\nand baselines of dopamine.\nIn Dr. Lembke's book,\nand when she was on the\nHuberman Lab Podcast\nand other podcasts,\nshe's talked about this\npleasure pain balance\nthat when we seek something\nthat we really like,\nor we indulge in it,\nlike eating a little piece of chocolate,\nif we really liked chocolate,\nthere's some pleasure.\nBut then there's a little bit of pain\nthat exceeds the amount of pleasure,\nand it's subtle,\nand we experience it as\nwanting more of that thing.\nOkay?\nSo there's a pleasure pain balance,\nand I'm telling you that\nthe pleasure and the pain\nare governed by dopamine to some extent.\nWell, how could that be?\nRight?\nI said before, when you\nengage in an activity\nor when you ingest something\nthat increases dopamine,\nthe dopamine levels go up,\nyou know, to substantial degree\nwith all the things I listed off.\nWhere's the pain coming from?\nWell, the pain is coming\nfrom the lack of dopamine\nthat follows.\nAnd you now know what that\nlack of dopamine reflects.\nHow do you know?\nWell, earlier we were\ntalking about how dopamine\nis released between neurons.\nAnd I mentioned two ways.\nOne, is into the synapse\nwhere it can activate\nthe postsynaptic neuron.\nAnd the other was what I\ncalled volumetric release\nwhere it is distributed more broadly.\nIt's released out over a bunch of neurons.\nIn both cases it's\nreleased from these things\nwe call synaptic vesicles,\nliterally little bubbles,\ntiny, tiny little bubbles\nthat contain dopamine.\nPrrr! They get vomited out into the area\nor into the synapse.\nWell, those vesicles get depleted.\nFor the synaptic physiologists out there,\nwe call this the readily\nreleasable pool of dopamine.\nWe can only deploy dopamine\nthat is ready to be deployed.\nThat's packaged in those little\nvesicles and ready to go.\nIt's like when you order a\nproduct and they say out of stock\nuntil two months from now.\nWell, it's not ready to be released.\nSame thing with dopamine.\nThere's a pool of\ndopamine that synthesized,\nand you can only release the dopamine\nthat's been synthesized.\nIt's the readily releasable pool.\nThe pleasure pain balance\ndoesn't only hinge\non the readily releasable\npool of dopamine,\nbut a big part of the\npleasure pain balance\nhinges on how much dopamine is there?\nAnd how much is ready and\ncapable of being released\ninto the system?\nSo now we've given some meat to this thing\nthat we call the pleasure pain balance,\nand now it should make perfect sense\nwhy if you take something or do something\nthat leads to huge increases in dopamine,\nafterward your baseline should drop\nbecause there isn't a\nlot of dopamine around\nto keep your baseline going.\nFortunately, most people do not experience\nor pursue enormous increases in dopamine\nleading to the severe drops in baseline.\nMany people do, however,\nand that's what we call addiction.\nWhen somebody pursues\na drug or an activity\nthat leads to huge increases in dopamine.\nAnd now you understand that afterward\nthe baseline of dopamine drops\nbecause of depletion of dopamine,\nthat readily releasable pool.\nThe dopamine is literally\nnot around to be released,\nand so people feel pretty lousy\nand many people make the mistake\nof then going and pursuing\nthe dopamine evoking the\ndopamine releasing activity\nor substance again thinking mistakenly\nthat it's going to\nbring up their baseline.\nIt's going to give them that peak again.\nNot only does it not give them a peak,\ntheir baseline gets lower and lower\nbecause they're depleting\ndopamine more and more and more.\nAnd we've seen this over and over again\nwhen people get addicted to something\nthen they're not achieving\nmuch pleasure at all.\nYou can even see this with video games.\nPeople will play a video game,\nthey love it,\nit's super exciting to them,\nand then they'll keep playing\nand playing and playing,\nand either one of two things\nhappens typically both.\nFirst of all,\nI always say addiction is\na progressive narrowing\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nSo oftentimes what will\nhappen is the person\nonly has excitement and can\nachieve dopamine release\nto the same extent doing that behavior\nand not other behaviors.\nAnd so they start losing\ninterest in school,\nthey start losing\ninterest in relationships.\nthey start losing interest\nin fitness and wellbeing\nand depletes their life.\nAnd eventually what typically happens is,\nthey will stop getting dopamine release\nfrom that activity as well,\nand then they drop into a\npretty serious depression\nand this can get very severe and people\nhave committed suicide from\nthese sorts of patterns\nof activity.\nBut what about the more typical scenario?\nWhat about the scenario of somebody\nwho is really good at\nworking during the week,\nthey exercise during the week,\nthey drink on the weekends?\nWell, that person is\nonly consuming alcohol\nmaybe one or two nights a week,\nbut oftentimes that same\nperson will be spiking\ntheir dopamine with food\nduring the middle of the week.\nNow, we all have to eat\nand it's nice to eat foods\nthat we enjoy.\nI certainly do that.\nI love food in fact.\nBut let's say they're eating foods\nthat really evoke a\nlot of dopamine release\nin the middle of the week,\nthey're drinking one or\ntwo days on the weekend,\nthey are one of these\nwork, hard play hard type.\nSo they're swimming a\ncouple miles in the ocean\nin the middle of the week as well.\nThey're going out dancing\nonce on the weekend.\nSounds like a pretty balanced\nlife as I describe it.\nWell, here's the problem.\nThe problem is that\ndopamine is not just evoked\nby one of these activities,\ndopamine is evoked by\nall of these activities.\nAnd dopamine is one currency\nof craving motivation\nand desire and pleasure.\nThere's only one currency.\nSo even though if you\nlook at the activities,\nyou'd say, well, it's just on the weekends\nso this thing is only a\ncouple of times a week.\nIf you looked at dopamine\nsimply as a function,\nas a chemical function\nof peaks and baseline,\nit might make sense why this person\nafter several years of\nwork hard, play hard\nwould say, yeah, you know I'm\nfeeling kind of burnt out.\nI'm just not feeling like\nI have the same energy\nthat I did a few years ago.\nAnd of course there\nare age-related reasons\nwhy people can experience drops in energy,\nbut oftentimes what's happening\nis not some sort of depletion\nand cellar metabolism\nthat's related to aging.\nWhat's happening is they're\nspiking their dopamine\nthrough so many different\nactivities throughout the week,\nthat their baseline is\nprogressively dropping.\nAnd in this case it can be very subtle.\nIt can be very, very subtle.\nAnd that's actually a very\nsinister function of dopamine\nwe could say.\nWhich is that it can often\ndrop in imperceptible ways,\nbut then at once it reaches\na threshold of low dopamine,\nwe just feel like,\nhmm, we can't really get\npleasure from anything anymore.\nWhat used to work doesn't work anymore.\nSo it starts to look a lot\nlike the more severe addictions\nor the more acute addictions\nto things like cocaine\nand amphetamine which lead\nto these big increases,\nthese big spikes in dopamine,\nand then these very severe\ndrops in the baseline.\nNow, of course, we all\nshould engage in activities\nthat we enjoy.\nI certainly do,\neverybody should.\nA huge part of life is\npursuing activities and things\nthat we enjoy.\nThe key thing is to\nunderstand this relationship\nbetween the peaks and the baseline,\nand to understand how they\ninfluence one another.\nBecause once you do that,\nyou can start to make really\ngood choices in the short run\nand in the long run to\nmaintain your level of dopamine\nbaseline.\nMaybe even raise that\nlevel of dopamine baseline\nand still get those peaks and\nstill achieve those feelings\nof elevated motivation,\nelevated desire and craving.\nBecause again, those peaks\nand having a sufficiently\nhealthy high level of dopamine baseline\nare what drove the\nevolution of our species,\nand they're really what drive\nthe evolution of anyone's life\nprogression too.\nSo they're a good thing.\nDopamine is a good thing.\nJust very briefly, because\nit was also covered\nin the interview episode\nI did with Anna Lembke\nabout addiction.\nSome of you might be asking,\nwhat should I do if I experience a drop\nin my baseline level of dopamine\nbecause of engagement with\nsome activity or some substance\nthat led to big peaks?\nJust to put some color\nand example on this,\na few episodes ago I talked about a friend\nwho I've known a long time.\nSo it actually the child of a friend\nwho has basically become\naddicted to video games,\nhe decided actually after\nseeing that episode with Anna\nto do a 30-day complete fast from phone,\nfrom video games and from\nsocial media of all kinds.\nHe's now at day 29 has\nreally accomplished this,\nnot incidentally, his\nlevels of concentration,\nhis overall mood are up.\nHe's doing far far better.\nWhat he did is hard.\nIn particular first 14\ndays is really hard,\nbut the way that you\nreplenish the releasable pool\nof dopamine is to not\nengage in these dopaminergic\nseeking behaviors.\nBecause remember typically\npeople arrive at a place\nwhere they want to stop\nengaging in these behaviors\nor ingesting substances when\nthat dopamine is depleted,\nwhen they're not getting the same lift.\nIn his case, he was feeling depressed.\nHe thought he had ADHD.\nThey were starting to treat it as ADHD.\nAnd certainly there are people\nout there who have ADHD,\nbut what he found was that\nhis levels of concentration\nare back.\nHe does not need to be treated for ADHD.\nAnd actually the psychiatrist\nwondered if he did prior\nto this video game, social media fast.\nHe's feeling good.\nHe's exercising again.\nI'm not making this up.\nThis is really a very specific,\nbut very relevant example\nof how the dopamine system\ncan replenish itself.\nOf course, if there's a clinical\nneed for ADHD treatment,\nby all means pursue that.\nBut I think a lot of\nADHD does go misdiagnosed\nbecause of this depletion in dopamine\nthat occurs because of\noverindulgence in other activities\nin the drop in baseline.\nSo for anyone that's experienced\na real drop in baseline\nwho has addictive tendencies,\nwhether or not their\nbehaviors or substances,\nthat is always going\nto be the path forward.\nIs going to be either cold turkey\nor through some sort of\ntapering to limit interactions\nwith the, what would otherwise\nbe the dopamine evoking\nbehavior or substance.\nSo let's talk about the optimal\nway to engage in activities\nor to consume things that evoke dopamine.\nAnd by no means am I\nencouraging people to take drugs\nof abuse.\nI would not do that,\nI am not doing that.\nBut some of the things on these lists\nof dopamine evoking activities\nare things like chocolate,\ncoffee, even if it's indirect.\nSex and reproduction,\nprovided it's healthy\nconsensual context appropriate,\nage appropriate, species\nappropriate of course,\nis central to our evolution\nand progression as a species.\nSo certain things like\ncocaine, amphetamine,\nI will put in the classification of bad.\nI'm willing to do that.\nAnd other things are part of life,\nfood, exercise if that\nevokes your dopamine.\nHow are we supposed to engage\nwith these dopamine evoking\nactivities in ways that are\nhealthy and beneficial for us?\nHow do we achieve these peaks,\nwhich are so central to our\nwellbeing and experience of life\nwithout dropping our baseline?\nAnd the key lies in intermittent\nrelease of dopamine.\nThe real key is to not\nexpect or chase high levels\nof dopamine release every time we engage\nin these activities.\nIntermittent reward schedules\nare the central schedule\nby which casinos keep you gambling.\nThe central schedule by\nwhich elusive partners\nor potential partners keep\nyou texting and pursuing\non either side of the relationship.\nIntermittent schedules are\nthe way that the internet\nand social media and all\nhighly engaging activities\nkeep you motivated and pursuing.\nAnd we can take this back\nto our evolutionary adaptive\nscenario where you are out\nthere looking for water,\nlooking for food,\nnot every trail, not every\npursuit, not every hunch\nabout where the animals will be?\nWhere the food will be?\nWhere the berries will be?\nNot every single one of those played out.\nThere's something called\ndopamine reward prediction error.\nWhen we expect something to happen,\nwe are highly motivated to pursue it.\nIf it happens great, we get the reward.\nThe reward comes in various chemical forms\nincluding dopamine,\nand we are more likely to\nengage in that behavior again.\nThis is the basis of casino gambling.\nThis is how they keep you going back\nagain and again and again,\neven though on average\nthe house really does win.\nYou can transplant that\nexample to any number\nof different pleasureful activities.\nIf you're not a gambler and\nthat doesn't appeal to you,\nI have to imagine there's\nsomething that appeals to you,\nsomething that you do\nrepeatedly because you enjoy it.\nAnd almost inevitably it's\nbecause there's an intermittent\nschedule.\nThere's a intermittent\nschedule by which dopamine\nsometimes arrives,\nsometimes a little bit, sometimes a lot,\nsometimes a medium amount.\nOkay?\nThat intermittent reinforcement schedule\nis actually the best schedule\nto export to other activities.\nHow do you do that?\nWell, first of all, if you\nare engaged in activities\nschool, sport, relationship, et cetera,\nwhere you experience a win,\nyou should be very careful\nabout allowing yourself\nto experience huge peaks in dopamine,\nunless you're willing to\nsuffer the crash that follows\nand waiting a period of\ntime for it to come back up.\nWhat would this look like\nin the practical sense?\nWell, let's say you are somebody\nwho really does enjoy exercise,\nor let's say you're somebody\nwho kind of likes exercise,\nbut forces yourself to do it,\nbut you make it pleasureful\nby giving yourself\nyour favorite cup of coffee first,\nor maybe taking a pre-workout drink\nor taking an energy drink\nor listening to your favorite music.\nAnd then you're in the gym\nand you're listening to your music.\nThat all sounds great, right?\nWell, it is great except\nthat by layering together\nall these things to try and\nachieve that dopamine release,\nand by getting a big peak in dopamine,\nyou're actually increasing the\nnumber of conditions required\nto achieve pleasure from\nthat activity again.\nAnd so there is a form\nof this where sometimes\nyou do all the things that you love\nto get the optimal workout.\nYou listen to your favorite music,\nyou got your favorite time of day,\nyou have your pre-workout drink,\nif that's your thing.\nYou do all the things that\ngive you that best experience\nof the workout for you.\nBut there's also a version\nof this where sometimes\nyou don't do the dopamine\nenhancing activities.\nYou don't ingest anything\nto increase your dopamine.\nYou just do the exercise.\nYou don't do the exercise\nand expect dopamine to arrive\nthrough some what we call\nexogenous source as well.\nYou might think, well, that sounds lame.\nI want to continue to enjoy exercising.\nAh, well, that's exactly the point.\nIf you want to maintain\nmotivation for school, exercise,\nrelationships or pursuits\nof any duration in kind,\nthe key thing is to make sure\nthat the peak in dopamine,\nif it's very high,\ndoesn't occur too often.\nAnd if something does occur very often\nthat you vary how much\ndopamine you experience\nwith each engagement in that activity.\nNow, some activities naturally\nhave this intermittent\nproperty woven into them, right?\nWe sometimes have classes that we like\nand other classes we don't like.\nWe don't always get straight A's,\nsometimes we don't get\nrewarded with the outcome\nthat we would like.\nWe don't always have the\nperfect relationship outcome,\nbut understand that your\nability to experience motivation\nand pleasure for what comes next\nis dictated by how much\nmotivation and pleasure\nand dopamine you experienced prior.\nThe reason I can't give\na very specific protocol\nlike delete dopamine or lower\ndopamine every third time,\nis that that wouldn't be intermittent.\nThe whole basis of\nintermittent reinforcement\nis that you don't really\nhave a specific schedule\nof when dopamine is going to be high,\nand when dopamine is going to be low\nand when dopamine is going to be medium.\nThat's a predictable schedule,\nnot a random intermittent schedule.\nSo do like the casinos do\ncertainly works for them\nand for activities that you\nwould like to continue to engage\nin over time,\nwhatever those happen to be.\nStart paying attention\nto the amount of dopamine\nand excitement and pleasure\nthat you achieve with those,\nand start modulating\nthat somewhat at random.\nThat might be removing\nsome of the dopamine\nreleasing chemicals that\nyou might take prior.\nMaybe you remove them every time,\nbut then every once in a\nwhile you introduce them,.\nMaybe it involves sometimes\ndoing things socially\nthat you enjoy doing socially,\nsometimes doing the same thing, but alone.\nThere are a lot of\ndifferent ways to do this.\nThere are a lot of different\nways to approach this,\nbut now knowing what you know\nabout peaks and baselines\nin dopamine and\nunderstanding how important\nit is not just to achieve peaks,\nbut to maintain that\nbaseline at a healthy level,\nit should be straightforward\nfor you to implement\nthese intermittent schedules.\nFor those of you that are\nbegging for more specificity,\nwe can give you a tool.\nOne would be, you can flip\na coin before engaging\nin any of these types of activities\nand decide whether or not\nyou are going to allow\nother dopamine supportive elements\nto go for instance, into the gym with you.\nAre you going to listen to music or not?\nIf you enjoy listening to music,\nwell then flip a coin,\nand if it comes up heads,\nbring the music in,\nif it comes up tails, don't.\nOkay?\nIt sounds like you're\nundercutting your own progress,\nbut actually you are\nserving your own progress\nboth short-term and\nlong-term by doing that.\nNow, the smartphone is\na very interesting tool\nfor dopamine in light of all this.\nIt's extremely common\nnowadays to see people texting\nand doing selfies and\ncommunicating in various ways,\nlistening to podcasts, listening to music,\ndoing all sorts of\nthings while they engage\nin other activities or going to dinner\nand texting other people or making plans,\nsharing information.\nThat's all wonderful,\nit gives depth and\nrichness and color to life,\nbut it isn't just about\nour distracted nature\nwhen we're engaging with the phone,\nit's also a way of layering in dopamine.\nAnd it's no surprise\nthat levels of depression\nand lack of motivation are\nreally on the increase.\nEverything that we've\ntalked about until now\nsets up an explanation or interpretation\nof why interacting with digital technology\ncan potentially lead to disruptions\nor lowering in baseline\nlevels of dopamine.\nI can use a personal example for this.\nI happen to really enjoy working out,\nI've always really enjoyed it.\nBut in recent years I noticed that,\nif I was bringing my phone to my workouts,\nthen not only was I a\nlittle bit more distracted\nand not focusing on what I was doing\nas much as I could have or should have,\nbut also I started to lose\ninterest in what I was doing.\nIt wasn't as pleasureful,\nI would feel like it\njust didn't have the same\nkind of oomph.\nAnd I was beginning to\nquestion my motivation.\nAs I started learning more\nabout this relationship\nbetween the peaks and the\nbass lines in dopamine.\nWhat I realized was that some time ago\nI probably experienced\na incredible increase\nin the amount of dopamine\nduring one of my workouts,\nbecause I enjoy working out\nand I enjoy listening to music.\nI also enjoy listening to podcasts,\nI also enjoy communicating with people.\nThose are all wonderful pursuits,\nbut I had layered in too\nmany of them too many times.\nAnd then it essentially\nwasn't working for me anymore.\nMuch in the same way a drug\nwouldn't work for somebody\nwho takes it repeatedly because\ntheir baseline of dopamine\nis dropping.\nSo at least for this calendar year,\nI've made a rule for myself,\nwhich is I don't allow my\nphone into my workouts at all.\nNo music, at least not from the phone.\nIt can be in the room.\nI might listen to a podcast in the room,\nbut I don't listen to anything\nor engage in anything on my phone.\nNo texting whatsoever.\nAnd most of the time I just\ndon't even bring it with me\nfor that period of time.\nIt's only a short period of time.\nI'm not training that often.\nThis is something that I\nthink has been misinterpreted\nas people can't be alone now.\nPeople talk about, oh, you know,\nthey can't walk across the\nstreet or they can't go anywhere,\nride the bus,\ncan't be on the plane\nwithout being in contact.\nThey can't handle just their thoughts.\nI don't think that's\nreally what's going on.\nI think what's happened\nis that we achieved\nthe great dopamine increase\nthat comes from this incredible thing\nwhich I personally enjoy being\nable to communicate by phone,\nby text and exchange\npictures and send links\nand these kinds of things, social media.\nBut then what happens is\nit doesn't have that same\nfulfilling aspect to it.\nAnd it tends to remove the excitement\nand the pleasure of the very activities\nthat we are engaged in.\nSo I know this is a hard\none for many people,\nbut I do invite you to\ntry removing multiple\nsources of dopamine release\nor what used to be multiple\nsources of dopamine release\nfrom activities that you\nwant to continue to enjoy,\nor that you want to enjoy more.\nAnd now you understand\nthe biological mechanisms\nthat would underlie a statement like that.\nIt takes a little bit of working with,\nI know it can be challenging\nin the first week\nor so of not engaging with the phone\nduring any kind of workout.\nThat actually was really tough,\nbut now I'm back to a place\nwhere I enjoy it that much more.\nI also feel as if I conquered something\nin terms of the circuitry\nrelated to dopamine.\nI now understand why something\nthat I enjoyed so much had\nbecome less pleasureful for me.\nAnd there's a deep, deep satisfaction\nthat comes from understanding,\nokay, there wasn't anything wrong with me\nor what I was doing or anything at all.\nIt was just there was something\nwrong with the approach\nI was taking,\nwhich was layering in all\nthese sources of dopamine\nand dropping my baseline.\nFor this very same reason,\nI caution people against\nusing stimulants every time\nthey study or every time they work out\nor every time that they do anything\nthat they would like to continue to enjoy\nand be motivated at.\nThere's one exception which is caffeine,\nbecause as I mentioned before,\nif you like caffeine,\nthat actually could be a good thing\nfor your dopamine system,\nbecause it does upregulate\nthese D2, D3 receptors.\nSo it actually makes whatever dopamine\nis released by that activity,\nmore accessible or more\nfunctional within the biochemistry\nand the pathways of your brain and body.\nHowever, a number of energy drinks\nand particular pre-workouts contain things\nthat are precursors to dopamine,\nand on their own, even if you\ndidn't engage in the activity\nwould cause the release of\ndopamine to a substantial degree.\nThey do cause the release of dopamine\nto a substantial degree.\nAnd over time that will\ndeplete your dopamine.\nSo energy drinks, pre-workout drinks,\ndrugs of various kinds\nthat people take to study\nand pay attention.\nWe talked about some of\nthese for the ADHD episode,\nthings like Adderall, Ritalin,\narmodafinil or modafinil\ntaken repeatedly over time will reduce\nthe level of satisfaction and joy\nthat you get from the activities\nyou engage in while under the\ninfluence of those compounds.\nI'm not trying to demonize those compounds\nfor their clinical use.\nWhat I'm saying is taking stimulants\nand then engaging in activities\nthat you would like to\ncontinue to feel pleasureful\nis undercutting the process.\nAnd inevitably might not happen tomorrow,\nmight not happen in a month,\nbut inevitably you will have\nchallenges with motivation\nand drive related to those activities.\nNow, some people can\nkeep it right in check.\nThey can just do the one\ncan have the energy drink\nor they only do their pre-workout\nbefore really hard days,\nfor instance.\nMore power to you.\nI actually do that sometimes, frankly.\nBut people who are trying\nto get into that peak\nsuper motivated, driven, driven state,\nreally focused every time\nthey engage in an activity,\nyou are absolutely\nundercutting the process\nand you are undermining your\nability to stay motivated\nand focused.\nSo just as we talked about\nintermittent reward schedules\na moment ago,\nintermittent spiking of\ndopamine if you do it at all\nis definitely the way to go,\nand chronically trying\nto spike your dopamine\nin order to enhance your\nmotivation, focus and drive\nwill absolutely undermine your\nmotivation focus and drive\nin the long run.\nIngestion of caffeine is\nsomewhat of an exception\namong the other examples of things\nI've mentioned to avoid before\nwhat would otherwise be\ndopamine increasing activities.\nBecause again, caffeine\ncan increase the density\nand the efficacy of\nthese dopamine receptors.\nIt turns out that the source\nof caffeine could also matter\nwhile coffee or tea or\nother forms of caffeine\nwill have this effect of\nincreasing dopamine receptors.\nYerba mate something\nI've talked about before\non this podcast has some\ninteresting properties.\nFirst of all, it contains caffeine.\nIt's also high in antioxidants.\nIt also contains something called GLP-1\nwhich is favorable for\nmanagement of blood sugar levels.\nYerba mate turns out has also been shown\nto be neuroprotective specifically\nfor dopaminergic neurons.\nNow, I should mention this\nis just a couple of studies,\nso we don't want to conclude\ntoo much from these studies\nmore needs to be done.\nBut they showed that in a model of damage\nto dopamine neurons,\ningestion of yerba mate,\nand some of the compounds\nwithin yerba mate\ncan actually serve to\npreserve the survival\nof dopamine neurons in both\nthe movement related pathway\nand the motivation pathway.\nSo perhaps you need that incentive\nin order to ingest your yerba mate,\nperhaps you don't need any incentive.\nIn my case, I don't need any incentive.\nI already enjoy yerba mate as my principle\nsource of caffeine,\nalthough I do drink coffee as well.\nBut if one were going to consume caffeine,\nyou might consider consuming that caffeine\nin the form of yerba mate\nboth for sake of upregulating\ndopamine receptors and getting\nmore of a dopamine increase.\nAnd of course, for the\nsimilar properties of caffeine\nif that's what you're seeking.\nAnd in addition to that,\nbecause your yerba mate does appear\nto have some sort of neuroprotective\nand a particular dopamine\nneuron protective properties.\nNow, that doesn't mean that\ncaffeine is always beneficial.\nAnd actually there's one\ninstance related to dopamine\nwhere caffeine can be\nparticularly dangerous.\nAnd this relates to\nMDMA so-called ecstasy.\nMDMA is under investigation\nin various clinical trials\nfor its potential to treat\ntrauma and depression.\nIt's also of course, a drug\nthat's used recreationally.\nIt's still illegal at\nleast in the United States.\nWhether or not MDMA is neurotoxic\nhas been very controversial.\nEarly on it was thought\nthat it is neurotoxic\nthat it can destroy serotonergic neurons.\nThere were other papers that came out\nwhich argued that's not the case.\nAnd that's in particular\nbecause one of the early papers\npublished in science magazine claiming\nthat MDMA was neurotoxic.\nThat paper was retracted.\nIt turns out that that\nstudy had mistakenly\nused methamphetamine instead,\nand methamphetamine is\nknown to be neurotoxic.\nI think most of the data point to the idea\nthat MDMA might not be neurotoxic,\nbut in any case, caffeine\nhas been shown to increase\nthe toxicity of MDMA receptors.\nAnd you might say, \"Well,\nhow could that be?\"\nWell, now you understand\nwhy that could be.\nCaffeine increases the\ndensity and efficacy\nof these dopamine receptors,\nD2 and D3 receptors.\nMDMA is a potent drug for\nincreasing concentrations\nof dopamine as well as serotonin\nand other neuromodulators.\nAnd it appears that caffeine\ningestion by upregulating\nthese receptors,\ncan lead to more toxicity of MDMA.\nSo caffeine can be a beneficial\nsubstance in one context,\nand actually can be a detrimental\nif not dangerous substance\nin another context.\nTwo substances that\ngreatly increase dopamine,\nnamely amphetamine and cocaine\ncan cause long-term problems\nwith the dopaminergic pathways.\nAnd this is largely based on a study\nthat was published some years ago, 2003,\nbut still holds a lot of merit.\nThis is a paper published in proceeds\nin the National Academy of Sciences,\na very high tier stringent journal.\nFirst author is Kolb, K-O-L-B.\nAnd the title of the paper\npretty much tells the story.\nAmphetamine or cocaine limits the ability\nof later experience to\npromote structural plasticity\nin the neocortex and nucleus accumbens.\nNeocortex is the outer shell\nof the brain more or less.\nAnd the nucleus accumbens is part of that,\nmesolimbic dopamine pathway\nfor motivation drive\nand reinforcement.\nNeuroplasticity of course, is\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nAnd neuroplasticity is the\nbasis of learning and memory\nand essentially remodeling\nof our neural circuitry\nin positive ways of all kinds.\nAnd this study was really\none of the first to show\nthat ingesting amphetamine and cocaine\nbecause of the high peak in dopamine\nthat it creates and\nthe low dopamine state,\nthe baseline drop that\nit creates afterwards,\nlimits plasticity and learning subsequent\nto taking amphetamine and cocaine.\nIt was at least in this study shown\nto be a long lasting effect.\nI doubt it's a permanent effect,\nbut this should serve as\na serious cautionary note\nthat amphetamine and cocaine\nnot only can cause a drop\nin baseline dopamine,\nbut can actually put\nthe brain into a state\nin which it cannot learn and\nmodify itself to get better\nat least for some period of time.\nIn a previous episode on ADHD,\nI talked about the widespread use of drugs\nlike Adderall, Ritalin,\nmodafinil and armodafinil,\nall of which lead to very\nlarge increases in dopamine,\nand for people with ADHD can\nreally improve their symptoms.\nBut of course there's a\nlot of non-prescription,\nnon-clinical use of\nthose compounds as well.\nAnd it stands to reason that\nthe use of those substances\nto increase dopamine\ncould very well provide\nthe same sort of blockade\nof neuroplasticity\nthat cocaine and amphetamine do.\nBecause when you look at the\namount of dopamine increase\nthat's triggered by those compounds,\nit's really comparable.\nSo again, a cautionary note\nagainst spiking one's dopamine\ntoo much on a regular basis,\nunless there's a valid\nclinical need for doing that.\nSo we've been focusing a\nlot for the last few minutes\non the kind of darker side of dopamine\nand how getting big peaks in\ndopamine can be detrimental,\nbut I want to acknowledge the truth,\nwhich is that dopamine feels great.\nBeing in pursuit and\nmotivated and craving things\nfeels wonderful.\nAnd I don't want to demonize dopamine.\nWhat I'm trying to do\ntoday is to illustrate\nhow dopamine works in your brain\nso that you can continue to engage\nin dopamine evoking activities.\nAnd certainly there is a\nplace for ingesting things\nthat can increase dopamine\nprovided that they are safe\nfor us in the short and long-term.\nThere are activities that\nwe can do that will give us\nhealthy, sustained increases in dopamine,\nboth the peaks when they\nhappen and to maintain\nor even increase our\nbaseline levels of dopamine.\nSo how do we do that?\nWhat are some of these activities?\nWell, in recent years,\nthere's been a trend toward more people\ndoing so-called cold exposure.\nIn part, this was popularized by Wim Hof,\nthe so-called 'Iceman'\ngetting into cold showers,\ntaking ice baths, exposing\noneself to cold water\nof various kinds can in fact\nincrease our levels of dopamine\nas well as the neuromodulator\nnorepinephrine.\nThis is not a new phenomenon.\nIn the 1920s, a guy by the\nname of Vincent Priessnitz\nwas one of the first people\nto popularize and formalize\ncold water therapies.\nHe was an advocate of cold water exposure\nin order to boost the immune system\nand increase feelings of wellbeing.\nAnd actually this practice dates back long\nbefore Vincent's popularized it.\nAnd Wim Hof is the more\nrecent iteration of this.\nFirst of all, some of\nthe safety parameters.\nLet's establish those first.\nGetting to very, very cold water.\nYou know, 30 degree Fahrenheit\nor even low 40 degree Fahrenheit\ncan put somebody into a\nstate of cold water shock.\nI mean, people can die doing that.\nSo obviously you want to\napproach this with some caution,\nbut for most people getting\ninto 60 degree water\nor 50 degree water,\nor if you're acclimated\nand comfortable with it,\nyou know, 40 degree\nwater or 45 degree water\ncan have tremendously beneficial results\non your neuromodulator\nsystems, including dopamine.\nWhat temperature of water you can tolerate\nwill depend on how cold\nwater adapted you are,\nand how familiar you\nare with the experience\nof getting into cold water.\nAnd when I say comfortable with,\nI should mention, there is never a case\nin which getting into\ncold water does not evoke\na release of epinephrin.\nSo the quickening of the breath,\nthe widening of the eyes,\nthe feeling as if you\ncan't catch your breath\nand even some physical pain\nat the level of the skin\nthat happens almost every time,\nor every time that you\nget into cold water,\neven if your cold water adapted.\nWhat almost everybody knows\nand understands is that,\nthat wall, as I like to\nrefer to it is coming.\nThat's always the first experience\nof getting into cold water.\nThere's no real way around that.\nNow, this study that I mentioned earlier,\nhuman physiological responses\nto immersion into water\nof different temperatures,\nreally interesting study\nthat was done and published\nin the university of, excuse me,\nthe European Journal\nof Applied Physiology.\nI can provide a link to that\nstudy in the show caption.\nIt's a really interesting study.\nThey looked at people\ngetting exposed to water\nthat was warm, moderately\ncold or very cold.\nIt was 32 degrees Celsius,\n20 degrees Celsius,\nor 14 degrees Celsius.\nYou can just put those\nonline and do the conversion,\nor you can do the conversion\nto Fahrenheit if you like.\nBut in any case, what they\nlooked at were the concentrations\nof things like epinephrin\nand dopamine and so on.\nAnd what they found\nwas really interesting.\nFirst of all, upon\ngetting into cold water,\nthe changes in adrenaline\nand noradrenaline,\nepinephrin and norepinephrine\nwere immediate and fast,\nand these were huge increases.\nSo that's the getting into the cold water\nthat everybody experiences\nthese huge increases in adrenaline.\nBut then what was\ninteresting is they observed\nthat dopamine levels started\nto rise somewhat slowly\nand then continued to\nrise and reach levels\nas high as 2.5 times above baseline.\nThat's a remarkably high increase.\nRemember if we go back to our\nexamples of chocolate, sex,\na doubling above baseline,\nnicotine two and a half times\nabove baseline, cocaine.\nThe increase in dopamine\nfrom a cold water exposure\nof this kind was comparable\nto what one sees from cocaine,\nexcept, except in this case,\nit wasn't a rise and crash.\nIt was actually a\nsustained rise in dopamine\nthat took a very long\ntime up to three hours\nto come back down to baseline.\nWhich is really remarkable,\nand I think this explains\nsome of the positive,\nmental and physical effects\nthat people report subjectively\nafter doing cold water exposure.\nOne question that many of\nyou are probably asking\nis just how cold should the water be?\nWell, you could mimic what\nwas done in this study\nand do 14 degrees Celsius.\nBut for some people that\nwon't be cold enough,\nfor some people that will be too cold.\nThey did look at the\nrelease of stress hormones\nlike cortisol in addition\nto the release of things\nlike epinephrin and adrenaline.\nAnd it's interesting that\nthey noted that in all cases,\nbut especially at that\ncoldest temperature,\nthere was an increase in cortisol,\nbut that it was transient,\nThat eventually people's cortisol,\nthe stress hormone subsided a bit.\nThere are basically two\ndifferent approaches\nto remaining in the cold\nwhen it's uncomfortable.\nOne is to try and relax yourself.\nTwo, try and practice slow breathing,\nto try and dilate your gaze.\nI've talked about this\nbefore in previous podcasts,\nyou go into panoramic\nvision to essentially try\nand calm yourself so that\nit's not as stressful\nin the cold.\nOther people however, take the\napproach of trying to ramp up\ntheir level of internal autonomic arousal,\nmeaning to get really energized\nand kind of lean into\nthe friction of the cold.\nAnd they find that easier.\nOther people distract themselves,\nthey recite the alphabet,\nor they do something, anything to try\nand distract themselves\nfrom the discomfort.\nTo be totally honest,\nit does not matter for\nsake of dopamine release.\nBecause the dopamine release is triggered\nand then continues even after\nyou get out of the cold water.\nNow, in this study, it was\nlong exposure to cold water.\nIt was an hour.\nThat's a long period of time.\nAnd I do warn you against\ngetting into cold water\nthat's so cold that it will\nmake your temperature drop\nand make you hyperthermic for an hour.\nThat actually could be\ndangerous for a lot of people.\nYou might have a hard time reheating,\nand hypothermia is not a good thing.\nThey had people monitoring\nsubjects in these studies\nand paying attention to\ntheir core body temperature.\nThey were able to reheat them afterwards.\nIt's well-established now\nthat getting into cold water,\nwhether or not it's a shower,\nan ice bath circulating cold\nwater, a stream, et cetera,\nthat can evoke the norepinephrine\nrelease immediately,\nand the long arc of that dopamine release.\nWhy would that be good?\nUp until now, I've basically\nsaid getting increases\nin dopamine are detrimental\nto your baseline.\nWell, this does appear to\nraise the baseline of dopamine\nfor substantial periods of time.\nAnd most people report feeling\na heightened level of calm\nand focus after getting out of cold water.\nSo cold water exposure turns out\nto be a very potent stimulus for shifting\nthe entire milieu,\nthe entire environment\nof our brain and body\nand allowing many people\nto feel much, much better\nfor a substantial period of time\nafter getting out of the ice\nbath or cold water of any kind\nthan they did before.\nNow, you might ask how often to do this?\nSome people do this every day.\nIt can be very stimulating.\nSo typically doing it early in the day,\nit's going to be better.\nI don't necessarily recommend\ndoing it right before sleep,\nbut some people do it in the afternoon.\nAnd some people will indeed\ndo that seven days a week,\nother people three days a week,\nother people every once in a while.\nWhat I can say is once you\nbecome cold water adapted,\nonce it no longer has the\nsame impact of novelty\nand feeling a bit like a,\nI don't want to say a\nshock to your system,\n'cause you don't want to\ngo into cold water shock,\nbut once it is comfortable for you,\nthen it will no longer evoke this release.\nThere really does seem to\nbe something in the pathway\nfrom cold water exposure through\nthe norepinephrine pathway\nand into the mesolimbic brainstem\nthat causes this release in dopamine.\nBut nonetheless, it's\na basically zero cost.\nI mean, you need access\nto water of some sort,\ncold water shower, et cetera,\nbut basically zero cost way\nof triggering a long lasting\nincrease in dopamine\nwithout ingesting anything,\nno pharmacology whatsoever.\nPlease again, approach it with\na safety and caution in mind,\nbut it is a very potent stimulus.\nAgain, 250% of a rise in baseline,\ntwo and a half times\nrise in baseline rivals\nthat of cocaine which\nis really remarkable.\nNow, I'd like to talk\nabout the positive aspects\nof rewards for our behavior,\nand the negative aspects of\nrewards for our behavior.\nAnd from that, I will suggest a protocol\nby which you can achieve\na better relationship\nto your activities and\nto your dopamine system.\nIn fact, it will help tune\nup your dopamine system\nfor discipline, hard work and motivation.\nHard work is hard.\nGenerally, most people\ndon't like working hard.\nSome people do,\nbut most people work hard in\norder to achieve some end goal.\nEnd goals are terrific\nand rewards are terrific\nwhether or not they are\nmonetary social or any kind.\nHowever, because of the\nway that dopamine relates\nto our perception of time,\nworking hard at something\nfor sake of a reward\nthat comes afterward,\ncan make the hard work\nmuch more challenging\nand make us much less likely\nto lean into hard work\nin the future.\nLet me give you a couple\nexamples by way of data\nand experiments.\nThere's a classic experiment\ndone actually at Stanford\nmany years ago in which\nchildren in nursery school\nand kindergarten drew pictures,\nand they drew pictures\ncause they like to draw.\nThe researchers took\nkids that liked to draw\nand they started giving\nthem a reward for drawing.\nThe reward generally was a gold star\nor some thing that a young\nchild would find rewarding.\nThen they stopped giving\nthem the gold star.\nAnd what they found is the children\nhad a much lower tendency\nto draw on their own.\nNo reward.\nNow, remember this was an activity\nthat prior to receiving a reward,\nthe children intrinsically\nenjoyed and selected to do.\nNo one was telling them to draw.\nWhat this relates to\nis so-called intrinsic\nversus extrinsic reinforcement.\nWhen we receive rewards,\neven if we give ourselves\nrewards for something,\nwe tend to associate less\npleasure with the actual activity\nitself that evoked the reward.\nNow, that might seem counterintuitive,\nbut that's just way that the way\nthat these dopaminergic circuits work.\nAnd now understanding these\npeaks in baselines in dopamine\nwhich I won't review again,\nthis should make sense.\nIf you get a peak in\ndopamine from a reward,\nit's going to lower your baseline\nand the cognitive interpretation\nis that you didn't really do the activity\nbecause you enjoyed the activity.\nYou did it for the reward.\nNow, this doesn't mean all\nrewards of all kinds are bad,\nbut it's also important to understand\nthat dopamine controls\nour perception of time.\nWhen and how much dopamine we experience\nis the way that we carve up\nwhat we call our experience of time.\nWhen we engage in an activity,\nlet's say school or hard work of any kind\nor exercise because of the reward\nwe are going to give ourselves\na receive at the end,\nthe trophy, the sundae, the\nmeal, whatever it happens to be.\nWe actually are extending the time bin\nover which we are analyzing\nor perceiving that experience.\nAnd because the reward comes at the end,\nwe start to dissociate the neural circuits\nfor dopamine reward that would\nhave normally been active\nduring the activity.\nAnd because it all arrives\nat the end over time,\nwe have the experience\nof less and less pleasure\nfrom that particular activity\nwhile we're doing it.\nNow, this is the antithesis\nof growth mindset.\nMy colleague at Stanford, Carol\nDweck, as many of you know,\nhas come up with this\nincredible theory and principle,\nand actually goes beyond\ntheory and principle\ncalled \"Growth Mindset\",\nwhich is this striving to be\nbetter to be in this mindset\nof I'm not there yet,\nbut striving itself is the end goal.\nAnd that of course delivers\nyou to tremendous performance.\nIt's been observed over\nand over and over again,\nthat people that have growth mindset,\nkids that have growth mindset\nend up performing very well\nbecause they're focused\non the effort itself.\nAnd all of us can\ncultivate growth mindset.\nThe neural mechanism of\ncultivating growth mindset\ninvolves learning to access\nthe rewards from effort\nand doing.\nAnd that's hard to do\nbecause you have to engage\nthis prefrontal component\nof the mesolimbic circuit.\nYou have to tell yourself,\nokay, this effort is great,\nthis effort is pleasureful.\nEven though you might\nactually be in a state\nof physical pain from the exercise,\nor I can recall this from college,\njust feeling like I wanted\nto get up from my desk,\nbut forcing myself to study,\nforcing myself and forcing myself.\nWhat you find over time is\nthat you can start to associate\na dopamine release.\nYou can evoke dopamine\nrelease from the friction\nand the challenge that\nyou happen to be in.\nYou completely eliminate\nthe ability to generate\nthose circuits and the\nrewarding process of being able\nto reward friction while in effort,\nif you are focused only on the\ngoal that comes at the end.\nBecause of the way that\ndopamine marks time.\nSo if you say, oh, I'm going\nto do this very hard thing,\nand I'm going to push and\npush and push and push\nfor that end goal that comes later.\nNot only do you enjoy the process\nof what you're doing less,\nyou actually make it more painful\nwhile you're engaging in it.\nYou make yourself less efficient at it,\nbecause if you were able to\naccess dopamine while in effort,\ndopamine has all these\nincredible properties\nof increasing the amount\nof energy in our body,\nand in our mind, our ability to focus\nby way of dopamines\nconversion into epinephrin.\nBut also you're undermining\nyour ability to lean back\ninto that activity the next time.\nThe next time you need\ntwice as much coffee\nand three times as much loud music,\nand four times as much energy drink\nand the social connection\njust to get out the door\nin order to do the run or to study.\nSo what's more beneficial\nin fact can serve\nas a tremendous amplifier on all endeavors\nthat you engage in.\nEspecially hard endeavors is to A,\nnot start layering in\nother sources of dopamine\nin order to get to the starting line,\nnot layering in other sources of dopamine\nin order to be able to continue,\nbut rather to subjectively start to attach\nthe feeling of friction and effort\nto an internally generated reward system.\nAnd this is not meant to be vague,\nthis is a system that exists in your mind,\nthat exists in the minds of humans\nfor hundreds of thousands of years,\nby which you're not\njust pursuing the things\nthat are innately pleasureful,\nfood, sex, warmth, water\nwhen you're thirsty.\nBut the beauty of this\nmesolimbic reward pathway\nthat I talked about earlier is that,\nit includes the forebrain.\nSo you can tell yourself the\neffort part is the good part.\nI know it's painful,\nI know this doesn't feel good,\nbut I'm focused on this.\nI'm going to start to access the reward.\nYou will find the rewards,\nmeaning the dopamine\nrelease inside of effort\nif you repeat this over and over again.\nAnd what's beautiful about it is that,\nit starts to become reflexive\nfor all types of effort.\nWhen we focus only on the trophy,\nonly on the grade,\nonly on the win as the reward,\nyou undermine that entire process.\nSo how do you do this?\nYou do this in those moments\nof the most intense friction.\nYou tell yourself this is very painful\nand because it's painful,\nit will evoke an increase\nin dopamine release later,\nmeaning it will increase\nmy baseline in dopamine,\nbut you also have to tell yourself\nthat in that moment you\nare doing it by choice\nand you're doing it because you love it.\nAnd I know that sounds\nlike lying to yourself,\nand in some ways it is lying to yourself,\nbut it's lying to yourself\nin the context of a truth\nwhich is that you want it to feel better.\nYou want it to feel even pleasureful.\nNow, this is very far and away different\nfrom thinking about the\nreward that comes at the end,\nthe hot fudge sundae for after\nyou cross the finish line\nand you can replace hot fudge sundae\nwith whatever reward happens\nto be appealing to you.\nWe revere people who are capable of doing\nwhat I'm describing.\nDavid Goggins comes to mind\nis a really good example.\nMany of you are probably\nfamiliar with David Goggins,\nformer Navy SEAL who essentially\nhas made a post-military\ncareer out of explaining\nand sharing his process\nof turning the effort\ninto the reward.\nThere are many other examples\nof this too, of course.\nThroughout evolutionary history,\nthere's no question that we revered people\nwho were willing to go out\nand forage and hunt and gather\nand caretake in ways that other members\nof our species probably found exhausting\nand probably would have preferred\nto just put their feet up\nor soaked them in a cool stream\nrather than continue to forage.\nThe ability to access\nthis pleasure from effort\naspect of our dopaminergic circuitry\nis without question the most\npowerful aspect of dopamine\nand our biology of dopamine.\nAnd the beautiful thing is\nit's accessible to all of us.\nBut just to highlight the\nthings that can interfere with,\nand prevent you from\ngetting dopamine release\nfrom effort itself,\ndon't spike dopamine prior\nto engaging in effort.\nAnd don't spike dopamine\nafter engaging in effort,\nlearn to spike your\ndopamine from effort itself.\nOne straightforward example\nof learning to attach dopamine\nto effort and strain\nas opposed to a process\nor a reward that naturally\nevokes dopamine release\nis so-called intermittent fasting.\nI know this is very popular nowadays.\nSome people like to do\nintermittent fasting,\nsome people don't.\nSome people have a 12 hour\nfeeding window every 24 hours,\nsome people do long fasts\nof two to three days even.\nI personally don't\nmonitor a feeding window\nwith a lot of precision.\nI tend to skip one meal a day,\neither breakfast or lunch,\nand then I eat the other\ntwo meals of the day\ndepending on which meal I skipped.\nSo it's either breakfast, lunch\nand maybe a little\nsomething in the evening,\nor I'll skip breakfast and do\nlunch and dinner and so on.\nMany people are now\neating this way in part,\nbecause many people find\nit easier to not eat at all\nthan to eat a smaller\nportion of some food.\nAnd that has everything to\ndo with the dopamine reward\nevoking properties of food.\nWhen we ingest food or when\nwe are about to ingest food,\nour dopamine levels go up.\nAnd typically when we ingest food,\nif it evokes some dopamine release,\nthen we tend to want even more food.\nRemember dopamine's main\nrole is one of motivation\nand seeking.\nAnd what dopamine always wants\nmore of is more dopamine.\nMore activity or thing that\nevokes more dopamine release.\nWell, let's just look at fasting\nfrom the perspective of dopamine schedules\nand dopamine release\nand peaks and baselines.\nTypically, when we eat\nwe get dopamine release,\nespecially when we eat\nafter being very hungry.\nIf you've ever gone camping,\nor you're very, very hungry,\nthe food tastes that much better.\nAnd that's actually because of the way\nthat deprivation states increase the way\nthat dopaminergic circuits work.\nOur perception of dopamine is heightened\nwhen the receptors for dopamine\nhave not seen much dopamine lately,\nthey haven't bound much dopamine.\nSo when you fast, fast, fast, fast, fast,\nand then you finally eat,\nit evokes more dopamine release.\nSo this is the big reward\nthat comes at the end.\nEven bigger because you deprived yourself.\nThis is true for all rewarding\nbehaviors and activities\nby the way.\nThe longer you restrict\nyourself from that activity,\nthe greater the dopamine\nexperience when the dopamine\nis finally released,\nbecause of an upregulation of\nthe receptors for dopamine.\nbut I just spent five\nminutes or more telling you\nthat you should avoid too\nmuch reward at the end,\nand you should actually\nfocus on the dopamine\nthat you can consciously evoke\nfrom the deprivation strain\nand effort.\nAnd in fact, this is what\nhappens for many people\nthat start doing fasting\nand take a liking to it.\nMany people say that their state of mind\nwhen they fast is clearer,\nthat they actually start to\nenjoy the period of fasting.\nIn fact, some people start\npushing out their eating window\nor skipping entire days\nof eating more and more\nin order to get deeper\ninto that state of mind\nwhere surely it's not just dopamine,\nbut dopamine is released.\nThey will track their clock.\nOh, I've been fasting 12\nhours, 16 hours, et cetera.\nThey are starting to\nattach dopamine release\nor create dopamine release\nfrom the deprivation,\nnot from the food reward itself.\nAnd this I think makes it\nan interesting practice.\nAnd one that certainly has\nbeen practiced by for centuries\nin different cultures\nand different religions\nof deliberately restricting food,\nnot just to increase\nthe rewarding properties\nof food itself,\nbut also to increase\nthe rewarding properties\nof deprivation.\nAnd I should emphasize that a\nlot of the subjective aspects\nof the knowledge of\nthe benefits of fasting\nserve as reinforcing dopamine\namplifying aspects to fasting,\nmeaning if somebody does\nintermittent fasting\nand they are deep into their fast\nand they're telling themselves,\noh, my blood lipid profiles\nare probably improving.\nAnd my glucose management\nis probably improving.\nMy insulin sensitivity is going up,\nand I'm going to live longer.\nAll these things that have\nsome basis from animal studies\nand some basis or not from human studies,\nit's all kind of still\nan emerging literature,\nbut it does seem to be\npointing in that direction\nthat fasting can encourage\nthings like autophagy,\nthe engulfment of dead cells\nand things of that sort.\nWell, as people tell\nthemselves these things,\nthey are enhancing the\nrewarding properties\nof the behavior of fasting.\nAnd so this is a salient example\nof where knowledge of\nknowledge can actually help us\nchange these deep primitive\ncircuits related to dopamine.\nAnd this illustrates how the forebrain,\nwhich carries knowledge\nand carries interpretation\nand rational thought can be\nused to shape the very circuits\nthat are involved in generating reward\nfor what would otherwise\njust be kind of primitive\nbehaviors, hardwired behaviors.\nAnd that's the beauty of\nthese dopamine circuits.\nThat's the beauty of dopamine.\nIt's not just attached to the\nmore primitive of food, sex,\nheat, et cetera.\nIt's also attached to the things\nthat we decide are good for\nus and are important for us.\nSo telling yourself\nthat exercise or fasting\nor studying or listening better\nor any kind of behavior is good for you\nwill actually reinforce the extent\nto which it is good for\nyou at a chemical level.\nAnd a somewhat eerie example\nof what I just mentioned\nwas a study that was published last year\nin the journal Neuron, Cell Press journal,\nexcellent journal.\nThat showed that hearing something\nthat reinforces one's prior beliefs\nactually can evoke dopamine release.\nSo the dopamine pathway is so vulnerable\nto subjective interpretation\nthat it actually makes it such\nthat when we see something\nor hear something that validates a belief\nthat we already have,\nthat itself can increase dopamine release.\nAlong the lines of how\ndopamine and dopamine schedules\nand our perception of\nthings can shape the way\nthat we experience things\nas pleasureful or not.\nThere are beautiful studies\nmainly looking at sugar appetite\nand our sense of pleasure\nfrom sweet things,\nbut also for savory foods, et cetera.\nAnd essentially the results that come out\nof this are the following.\nIf you ingest something that you like,\nit tastes good to you,\nbut then you ingest\nsomething that's even sweeter\nor even more savory.\nAnd then you go back to the\nfood that you ate previously.\nWell, you don't like it as much,\nand that might seem like a duh, obviously.\nBut that shift in\nperception can be blocked\nby blocking the shift in dopamine.\nAnd so this really speaks\nto these peaks and valleys\nin dopamine that I mentioned before\nand how your experience of\nanything is going to depend\non your prior experience of other things\nthat evoke dopamine.\nBig dopamine release\nmakes it more challenging\nto experience more big dopamine release.\nSo dopamine is one of those things\nthat you don't want too high\nor too low for too long.\nIt's all about staying\nin that dynamic range\nand that's going to be\ndifferent for everybody.\nSo for the very savory foods\nthat are now everywhere,\nthose highly savory foods\nor I think they call them\nhighly palatable foods\nare making more bland foods, whole foods,\nmeaning foods that aren't processed.\nIt's making those tastes less\ngood at least for a while.\nAnd all it takes is a short\nperiod of time, even just days,\ntwo days or so of not consuming\nany highly palatable foods\nand suddenly broccoli with\njust a little bit of seasoning\ntastes delicious to you.\nAll right?\nSo again, this just speaks\nto the fact that dopamine\nis this universal currency.\nIt establishes value based on,\nnot just what you're\nexperiencing in the moment,\nbut what you experienced in\nthe days and minutes before.\nNow, that you understand\nhow your previous level\nof dopamine relates to your\ncurrent level of dopamine,\nand how your current level\nof dopamine will influence\nyour future level of dopamine,\nit should become obvious\nwhy things like pornography,\nnot just the accessibility of pornography,\nbut the intensity of\npornography can negatively shape\nreal world romantic and\nsexual interactions.\nThis is a serious concern.\nThe discussion is happening now.\nThe underlying neurobiological mechanisms\nyou now understand.\nAnd this isn't to pass judgment on whether\nor not people like or\ndon't like pornography,\nthat's an ethical discussion,\nand it's a moral discussion\nthat has to be decided\nfor each individual by\nvirtue of age, et cetera.\nBut again, any activity that evokes\na lot of dopamine release\nwill make it harder\nto achieve the same level and\ncertainly the greater level\nof dopamine through a\nsubsequent interaction.\nSo yes, indeed many people\nare addicted to pornography\nand yes, indeed many people\nwho regularly indulge\nin pornography experienced challenges\nin real-world romantic interactions.\nYou now understand the mechanisms behind\nwhat I'm telling you.\nNow, there are circumstances\nin which increasing levels\nof dopamine is desirable and advantageous\nand clinically helpful.\nGood example of this would\nbe the drug Welbutrin\nalso called bupropion\nwhich increases dopamine\nand norepinephrine.\nWellbutrin bupropion was developed\nas an alternative treatment for depression\nbecause some people who\ntake the so-called SSRI,\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\nwhich as the name suggests\nincreased serotonin\nsuffer from serotonin\nrelated side effects.\nThings like decreased\nappetite, decreased libido,\nor sometimes increased\nappetite or other side effects\nthat they don't want.\nAnd Wellbutrin seems to avoid\nthe sexual side effects.\nIt can blunt at appetite\nand these sorts of things\nbecause of the increase in\nnorepinephrine and dopamine\nincreases levels of\nmotivation and craving,\nbut also can create a\nstate of elevated alertness\nthat can sometimes get in\nthe way of healthy eating\nand things of that sort.\nSo one has to work with their\nclinician as psychiatrist.\nIt is a prescription drug in order\nto find the dosage of Welbutrin\nthat's correct for them.\nIn addition, things\nlike Welbutrin bupropion\ncan increase anxiety because\nof the way that dopamine\nand norepinephrine are stimulating\nand tend to place people\ninto heightened levels\nof alertness.\nNonetheless, many people\nhave gained terrific relief\nfrom depression from Wellbutrin bupropion,\nand many of those same\npeople had serious trouble\nwith some of the SSRI.\nSo it does seem to be a very useful drug\nin certain contexts,\nboth for depression and for\nthe treatment of smoking\nfor people desiring to quit smoking.\nAnd of course there are\na lot of people out there\nwho are seeking to increase\ntheir baseline levels\nof dopamine without\ntaking any prescription\npharmaceutical compounds.\nAnd nowadays there exist a\nlot of supplements to do that.\nThe two most common ones that are directly\nwithin the dopamine\npathway are Macuna Pruriens\nwhich is actually a velvety\nbean whose contents are l-DOPA.\nBelieve it or not, the\ncontent of this being\nis the precursor to dopamine.\nSo Macuna Pruriens is\nsold over the counter\nat least in the United States.\nAnd it literally is the\nprecursor to dopamine.\nMeaning if you take it,\nyou will experience very\nlarge increases in dopamine.\nThose increases are transient\nand very, very intense.\nAnd in fact, if you look at\nthe constellation of effects\nof Macuna Pruriens,\nwhat you find is that\nthey're pretty striking\nand they look a lot like\nif not identical to l-DOPA.\nThe most obvious of\nthose is in the context\nof Parkinson's disease.\nThere are at least five\nstudies that have shown\nthat Macuna Pruriens\ncan reduce the symptoms\nof Parkinson's disease,\nmuch in the same way\nthat l-DOPA can reduce\nthe symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\nAnd that shouldn't come as any surprise\ngiven what I just told you\nthat is essentially l-DOPA.\nIt also can reduce a particular\nhormone called prolactin.\nDopamine and prolactin\ntend to be in somewhat\npush pull fashion.\nWhen dopamine is up,\nprolactin is down and vice versa.\nProlactin is involved in\nmilk letdown in women.\nIt's involved in setting\nthe refractory period\nfor sex after ejaculation in males.\nThe reason mating can\noccur and then not occur\nafter a ejaculation is because\nof an increase in prolactin.\nMacuna Pruriens is often\nused a blunt prolactin,\nand they're actually a\ncouple of studies showing\nthat it can indeed do that.\nMacuna Pruriens has a\nnumber of other effects\nthat lie in the sex and\nreproduction pathway\nthat are worth noting.\nSperm concentration, sperm quality\nis actually greatly\nincreased by Macuna Pruriens.\nThese are kind of curious\neffects until you understand\na little bit more about\nthe biology of dopamine\nwhich I'll mention in a moment,\nbut there are several studies,\nfour in fact that describe\nhow Macuna Pruriens\ncan increase sperm count, sperm quality,\nand sperm motility.\nSo for those of you seeking\nto conceive children,\nMacuna Pruriens might\nbe an interesting choice\nif you're interested in exploring\nnon-prescription compounds.\nHowever, I should mention that any time\nyou consume a substance\nthat increases dopamine\nby mimicking dopamine or\nacting as a direct precursor\nto dopamine,\nthere's almost inevitably\na crash or a reduction\nin the baseline in dopamine\nthat we referred to previously.\nSo many people who take Macuna Pruriens\nfeel really elevated, really\nmotivated, really alert,\nall the sorts of things\nthat one would expect\nfrom a dopaminergic drug\nwhich Macuna Pruriens is.\nAnd then they feel a low\nor a reduction in drive\nand excitement and enthusiasm\nafter the drug wears off.\nJust like they would with other dopamine\nincreasing compound.\nFor that reason, many people have turned\nto the use of L-tyrosine.\nL-tyrosine is an amino\nacid precursor to l-DOPA.\nSo it lies further up the\ndopamine synthesis pathway.\nAnd nowadays it's very\ncommon because all L-tyrosine\nis sold over the counter\nin the United States\nthat people will take L-tyrosine as a way\nto get more energized alert and focused.\nIndeed, there are data that\nL-tyrosine will accomplish that.\nL-tyrosine is typically\ntaken in capsule form\nor powder form anywhere from 500 to 750\nto a 1000 milligrams.\nIt is a potent stimulus\nfor increasing dopamine.\nAnd the timescale for increasing dopamine\nis about 30 to 45 minutes after ingestion.\nDopamine levels start to peak.\nThe classic study that really nailed down\nthe fact that tyrosine has this effect\nwas published way back in 1983,\nJournal of Clinical\nEndocrinology and Metabolism\nthat directly compared\nL-tyrosine supplementation\nwith tryptophan ingestion on\nplasma dopamine and serotonin.\nTryptophan being a precursor to serotonin.\nAnd indeed what they found is\nthat ingestion of L-tyrosine\ncan increase the amount of\ndopamine circulating in the blood\nand in the brain too, of course.\nThe L-tyrosine ingestion induced dopamine\nincreases within 45 minutes\nand they were short-lasting\nafter about 30 minutes\nthe effect had dissipated,\nmeaning the levels of dopamine\nhad dropped down to baseline.\nAnd even though they didn't look at levels\nof baseline dopamine past that time point,\nthe expectation based\non everything we know\nabout dopamine biology is\nthat it would then drop\nbelow baseline due to the depletion\nof the readily reservable\npool of dopamine vesicles\nthat we talked about way\nback at the beginning\nof this episode.\nThe nice thing about this study\nis it does show specificity\nof effect because ingestion of tryptophan\ndid not increase dopamine\ninstead it increased serotonin.\nSo there's really\nspecificity of these pathways\nthat rule out any placebo type effects.\nI'm not suggesting that anybody, everybody\nincrease their dopamine\nlevels by way of tyrosine\nor Macuna Pruriens.\nFor those of you that\nare seeking to increase\nyour dopamine levels\nwithout prescription drugs,\nthose are the most direct route to that.\nOf course, if you have a pre-existing\ndopaminergic condition,\nso schizophrenia or psychosis of any kind,\nbipolar, anxiety,\nthings like Macuna Pruriens and L-tyrosine\nwill not be good for you.\nAnd if you don't, you should\njust understand and expect\nthat it's going to lead to\nan increase in dopamine.\nYou'll certainly feel an elevated state\nfor some of you that might be agitating,\nfor some of you that might\nbe really pleasureful,\nand then you will feel a crash afterwards.\nHow deep is that crash will\nreally depend on your biology\nand where your dopamine baseline began.\nSo I personally am not\na fan of using things\nlike Macuna Pruriens at all for myself\nfor the reasons I mentioned earlier,\njust too intense and too much of a crash.\nI do use L-tyrosine from time to time\nfor enhancing focus and motivation,\nbut I want to emphasize from time to time.\nSo I might use it once a week,\noccasionally twice a week,\nbut I've never been one to\ntake L-tyrosine regularly\nin order to focus or train or\ndo any kind of mental work.\nI just don't want to rely\non any exogenous substance\nin order to get my dopamine\ncircuits activated.\nAnd I don't want to experience\nthe drop in dopamine\nthat inevitably occurs some\nperiod of time afterwards.\nI should also mention\nthings that can reduce\nyour levels of baseline dopamine.\nOne that is rarely discussed is melatonin.\nI have talked before on this\npodcast about melatonin,\nwhy I am not a fan of using melatonin\nin order to enhance sleep.\nIt can help one get to sleep,\nbut not stay asleep.\nDr. Matt Walker sleep expert\nfrom University of California, Berkeley.\nI think I don't want to\nput words in his mouth,\nbut in our discussion about\nmelatonin on this podcast\nwhen Matt was a guest in his\nbook and on other podcasts,\nMatt has generally stated\nthat the use of melatonin\nexcept for treatment of jet lag\nis generally not a good idea.\nAnd I agree.\nI think that melatonin is\nnot often thought about\nas impacting the dopamine pathway,\nbut there's at least one\nstudy published in 2001\nfirst author is Nishiyama\njust as it sounds.\nIt's spelled just as it sounds.\nAcute effects of melatonin administration\non cardiovascular autonomic\nregulation in healthy men.\nSo the study wasn't\nspecifically about dopamine,\nbut they looked at norepinephrine\nand dopamine levels,\nand they found a statistically\nsignificant decrease\nin dopamine 60 minutes after\nmelatonin administration.\nI've talked before about\nhow viewing bright lights\nbetween the hours of\n10:00 p.m and 4:00 a.m\nhas been shown in studies\nby Dr. Samer Hattar,\nDavid Bersin, excellent\ncircadian scientists\nto reduce levels of\ndopamine for several days\nafter that light exposure.\nSo dim the lights at night,\nif you can avoid exogenous melatonin,\nmeaning if you don't\nhave to take melatonin\nand you can find a better alternative\nthat would be a good idea\nif you want to maintain\nhealthy levels of dopamine.\nNow, there is one compound\nthat you are all familiar with,\nand you've probably actually\ntaken without realizing it,\nthat increases dopamine.\nAnd that's something called\nPEA for phenethylamine,\ntechnically beta phenethylamine.\nAnd PEA is found in various foods.\nChocolate just happens to\nbe one in enriched in PEA\nand can increase synaptic\nlevels of dopamine.\nI personally take PEA from time to time\nas a focus and work aid\nin order to do intense\nbouts of work.\nAgain, I don't do that too often.\nThis might be once a week\nor once every two weeks.\nI might use it for training,\nbut typically I don't,\nit's usually for mental work.\nAnd I will take 500 milligrams of PEA\nand I'll take 300 milligrams of Alpha-GPC.\nThat's something that I personally do.\nThat's what's right for me,\nit's within my margins\nof safety for my health.\nAgain, you have to check\nwith your doctor and decide\nwhat's right for you.\nIt leads to a sharp but very\ntransient increase in dopamine\nthat lasts about 30 to 45 minutes.\nAnd at least in my system\nI've found to be much more\nregulated and kind of even\nthan something like L-tyrosine\nand certainly much more regulated and even\nand lower dopamine release than something\nlike Macuna Pruriens.\nOne of the lesser talked about\ncompounds that's out there,\nbut that's gaining popularity\nfor increasing dopamine\nand as a so-called nootropic is something\ncalled huperzine A.\nHuperzine A is a compound\nsold over the counter\nat least in the United States\nthat can increase\nacetylcholine transmission,\na different neuromodulator entirely.\nBut what's interesting is\nthat huperzine A somehow\nby way of interactions\nbetween the cholinergic system\nand the dopaminergic system\nleads to increases in dopamine\nin the medial prefrontal\ncortex and hippocampus.\nHippocampus, of course,\nbeing an area of the brain\nassociated with learning and memory.\nAnd prefrontal cortex being associated\nwith the mesolimbic pathway,\ndecision-making focus,\net cetera.\nAnd so I think the reason\nwhy we're seeing an increase\nin popularity of companies\nincluding huperzine A\nand nootropic compounds is\nboth for the cholinergic\nstimulating properties,\nbut also for stimulating dopamine release.\nI personally have never tried huperzine A.\nYou can go to www.examine.com\nor put huperzine A\ninto PubMed if you'd like to search around\nand see some of the science behind it.\nAgain, I'm not recommending\nanyone take these things.\nIn fact, I recommend against\nanyone just diving in,\nand starting to consume things\nwithout gaining knowledge\nabout how they function,\nwhether or not they're right for you.\nBut nonetheless, I think\nin the years to come,\nwe are going to see a\nlot more of L-tyrosine,\nPEA phenethylamine and\nhuperzine as a way of tapping\ninto the dopaminergic\nand cholinergic circuits\ncertainly along with things like Alpha-GPC\nas non-prescription, short-lived\nsomewhat milder alternatives to things\nthat really spike dopamine,\nthings like Adderall, Ritalin,\nmodafinil, armodafinil\nand similar.\nAnd I can't help but share\nwith you one more result.\nIt's not related to pharmacology.\nIt's related to behaviors\nand social interactions.\nAnd that's the very interesting\nand I would say important finding\nthat was made a few years ago\nby my colleague, Rob Malenka,\nwho's in our department\nof psychiatry at Stanford,\nshowing that oxytocin\nand social connection\nis actually directly stimulating\nthe dopamine pathway.\nI think for many years,\nall of us including me\nwould hear and thought\nthat oxytocin was in\nthe serotonergic pathway\nthat it was about pair bonding,\nand it was about some\nof these neuromodulators\nthat were more associated\nwith things related\nto feeling good with what we\nhave in the present moment.\nThat's typically what we\nthink of when we think\nof the opioid system or\nthe serotonergic system.\nThe dopamine system is really\nabout seeking and reward,\nbut in a paper published in\n2017 in the journal Science,\nexcellent journal.\nThe papers titled gaining of\nsocial reward by oxytocin,\nexcuse me, in the ventral tegmental area.\nYou now know what the\nventral tegmental area,\nit's that area of the mesolimbic pathway.\nWhat this paper\nessentially showed is that,\noxytocin social connection\nand pair bonding itself\ntriggers dopamine release.\nAnd as everyone read this\nresult, we all realized,\nah, this makes total sense\nthat for the evolution\nof our species,\nindeed for any species\nwhere social connections\nare important,\nit's also important to go\nseek social connections.\nAnd so, while it's fun to\nthink about pharmacology\nand underlying neurocircuitry\nand cold water baths\nand all these different things\nrelated to dopamine schedules\nand reward mechanisms and\nattaching reward to effort\nand all the various things\nthat we've talked about today\nin terms of science and\ntools and protocols,\nI'd be remiss if I didn't include\ndescription of this result\nand just emphasize that\nsocial connections,\nclose social connections in particular\nthat evoke oxytocin release.\nSo those are romantic type,\nthose are parent-child type,\nthose are friendship related,\nand those can even be just\nfriends at a distance related,\nright?\nIt doesn't actually require skin contact\nto get oxytocin release,\nbut oxytocin release is\ncentral to stimulating\nthe dopamine pathways.\nSo the take home message\nthere is quite simple,\nengage in pursue quality,\nhealthy social interactions.\nI know I've covered a\nlot of material today.\nI've really tried hard to focus on things\nthat lie directly within\nthe dopamine pathway\nand circuitries,\nas well as things that directly stimulate\nthose pathways and circuitries.\nWhat I haven't talked\nabout are all the things\nthat indirectly serve\nthe dopamine pathways.\nAnd out there on the internet\nand indeed in the scientific literature,\nyou will find for instance,\nthat things like Maca root\ncan increase dopamine.\nThings like the gut microbiome\ncan influence dopamine.\nAnd indeed they can,\nbut they do that through\nindirect mechanisms.\nBy creating a environment,\na milieu in which dopamine\nand dopamine circuits\ncan flourish.\nMaca is a good example of that.\nIt will reduce cortisol and\nthrough some indirect pathways\nrelated to cortisol can increase dopamine.\nBut it's not a direct\nincrease in dopamine.\nAnd so as a consequence,\nit's rather subtle\ncompared to the various\ncompounds and behaviors\nthat I talked about today.\nIndeed cold water exposure\nleads to huge increases\nin dopamine as we talked about before,\nand very sustained ones at that.\nI realize in giving you a lot\nof information about science\nand mechanism all the way\nfrom psychological biological\nto circuitry and synaptic transmission,\nvolumetric transmission and so forth,\nthat it might seem overwhelming.\nThe most important thing is to understand,\nor that these dopamine pathways\nreally are under your control.\nAnd the locus of control\nresides in the fact\nthat your previous levels of dopamine\nare influencing your levels\nof dopamine right now.\nAnd your current levels of dopamine\nand where you take them next,\nwill influence your dopamine\nlevels in the next days\nand weeks to come.\nSo I hope both with the mechanisms\nthat you now have in hand\nplus some of the tools to tap\ninto the dopaminergic system,\nboth behavioral,\npharmacologic prescription,\nand non-prescription, et cetera,\nthat you'll feel that\nyou have more control\nover your dopamine system.\nAnd certainly that you\nhave a better understanding\nof your dopamine system\nso that you can modulate\nand adjust your levels\nof dopamine in the ways\nthat serve you best.\nIf you're
