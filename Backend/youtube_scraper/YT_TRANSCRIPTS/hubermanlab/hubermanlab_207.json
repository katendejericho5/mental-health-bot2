    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat rock music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, I have the pleasure of introducing\nDr. Matthew Johnson.\nDr. Johnson is a professor of psychiatry\nat Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,\nwhere he also directs\nthe Center for Psychedelic\nand Consciousness Research.\nAs many of you know,\nthere's extreme excitement\nabout the use of psychedelics\nfor the treatment of various\ndisorders of the mind.\nDr. Johnson's laboratory\nis among the premier\nlaboratories in the world\nunderstanding how these compounds work,\nhow things like Psilocybin,\nand LSD, and related compounds\nallow neural circuitry in the brain\nto be shaped and changed,\nsuch that people can combat diseases,\nlike depression, or trauma,\nor other disorders of the mind\nthat cause tremendous suffering.\nDr. Johnson is also an\nexpert in understanding\nhow different types of drugs impact\ndifferent types of human behaviors,\nsuch as sexual behavior,\nrisk taking, and crime.\nDr. Johnson and his work\nhave also been featured\nprominently in the popular press,\nsuch as articles in \"The New York Times\"\nand Michael Pollan's book,\n\"How to Change Your Mind,\"\nand in a feature in \"60\nMinutes\" about psychedelics\nand the new emerging science\nof psychedelic therapies\nfor treating mental disorders.\nDuring the course of today's conversation,\nDr. Johnson and I talk about psychedelics\nat the level of what's\ncalled micro dosing,\nwhether or not it is useful\nfor the treatment of any mental disorders.\nWe also talk about more\ntypical macrodosing,\nwhat those macrodoses entail,\nand he walks us through\nwhat an experiment of a\npatient taking psychedelics\nfor the treatment of depression\nlooks like in his laboratory\nfrom start to finish.\nThe conversation was an\nabsolutely fascinating one\nfor me to partake in.\nI learned so much about the past, present,\nand future of psychedelic\ntreatments and compounds.\nAnd indeed, I hope to have Dr.\nJohnson on this podcast again\nin the not too distant future,\nso that we can talk about other compounds\nthat powerfully impact the\nmind and human behavior,\nand perhaps, can also be used\nto treat various diseases.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero\ncost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI've been taking Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens,\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nonce or twice a day every day,\nis because it covers my\nfoundational nutritional needs.\nIt has the vitamins I need,\nthe minerals I need,\nand the probiotics are important to me,\nbecause there is now so much data\nabout the importance of the\nso-called gut microbiome,\nmaintaining healthy gut bacteria,\nand the ways in which those gut bacteria\nimpact things like inflammation,\nand keeping inflammation\ndown in the brain and body,\nas well as supporting\nthings like quality mood,\nendocrine function, metabolic function,\njust so many factors.\nThe great thing about Athletic Greens\nis that it also tastes very good.\nI mix mine with water, a\nlittle bit of lemon juice,\nand as I mentioned, I drink\nthat once or twice a day.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/Huberman,\nand if you do that, you'll\nget the Athletic Greens,\nplus, you'll get five free travel packs.\nThe travel packs make it very\neasy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhen you're on the road, in the car,\non the plane, et cetera,\nand you'll get a year\nsupply of vitamin D3/K2.\nThere's now a lot of evidence\nthat vitamin D3 and K2 are important\nfor various aspects of metabolic health,\ncardiac health, and so forth.\nSo once again, that's\nathleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs,\nand your year supply of vitamin D3 and K2.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body,\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done,\nand now, with the advent\nof quality DNA tests,\nyou can get a lot of\ninformation about your genetics,\nand how that also impacts\nyour immediate and long-term health.\nThe reason I'm such a fan\nof getting blood work done,\nis that it is really the\nonly way to understand\nwhat's going on in your system\nat a level that can really\ninform your decisions\nabout your immediate and long-term health.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood and DNA tests, however,\nis that you get numbers\nback about your hormones,\nand your metabolic factors, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they have\na very easy to use dashboard\nthat gives you that information,\nand then gives you some\nsuggestions and directives\nabout things you could\nchange about your nutrition,\nabout your exercise, and\nother lifestyle factors\nthat can help you move those\nnumbers in the direction\nthat's best for you and for your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Belcampo.\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass-fed\nand finished certified humane meats.\nI eat meat about once a day,\nIn general, my lunch or my\nbreakfast consists of some meat,\nand that meat has to be\nof very high quality,\nand generally, I'll eat\nsome vegetable as well.\nAnd then I tend to eat pastas, and rice,\nand things of that sort\nlater in the day or in the evening\nin order to facilitate\nthe transition to sleep.\nSo I'm eating meat about once a day,\nand I always insist\nthat the meat that I eat\nbe of the very highest quality,\nand that the animals were\nraised and maintained humanely.\nWhile conventionally-raised\nanimals are confined to feedlots\nand eat a diet of inflammatory grains,\nBelcampo's animals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses,\nresulting in meat that's\nhigher in nutrients\nand healthy fats.\nIn addition, they raise\ntheir animals in a way\nthat's not just better for our health,\nbut also has a positive\nimpact on the environment.\nThey practice regenerative agriculture,\nwhich means the meat is climate positive\nand carbon negative,\nso you can feel good\nabout what you're eating\nat the environmental level,\nand for sake of your health.\nYou can order Belcampo's\nsustainably-raised meats\nto be delivered to you\nby using my code Huberman\nat belcampo.com/huberman,\nand entering my code Huberman\nto get 20% off your first time order.\nI'm partial to the rib-eyes\nor the New York steaks.\nSo on one day, I might have a ribeye.\nThe next day, I might\nhave a New York steak.\nI also really like the meatballs.\nI'm a particular fan of the meatballs.\nSo again, that's

a long time.\nI'm a huge fan of your scientific work,\nand I'm here to learn from you.\nSo-\n- Likewise.\nBig fan and happy to do this with you.\n- All right, well, thank you.\nMy first question is a very basic one,\nwhich is, what is a psychedelic?\nWe hear this term all the time,\nbut what qualifies a\nsubstance as a psychedelic?\n- Nomenclature is a real challenge\nin this area of psychedelics.\nSo starting with the word psychedelic,\nif you're a pharmacologist,\nit's not very satisfying,\nbecause that term really\nspans different pharmacological classes.\nIn other words,\nif you're really concerned\nabout receptor effects\nand the basic effects of a compound,\nit spans several classes of compounds.\nBut overall...\nSo it's really more of a cultural term,\nor it does have a\nrelationship to drug effects,\nbut it's at a very high level.\nSo all of the so-called psychedelics\nacross these distinct classes\nthat I can talk more about,\nthe way I put it, is\nthey all have the ability\nto profoundly alter\none's sense of reality,\nand that can mean many things.\nPart of that is profoundly altering\nthe sense of self acutely,\nso when someone's on the psychedelic.\nSo the different classes that can be,\nthe specific pharmacological classes\nthat can be called a psychedelic,\nare, one, what are called\nthe classic psychedelics.\nSo in the literature,\nyou'll see that term.\nHallucinogen and psychedelic all have\ntraditionally been used synonymously.\nI think there was a\nlittle of of a tendency\nto stay away from psychedelics,\nbecause of the baggage,\nbut there's been a return to\nthat in the last several years.\nBut the classic psychedelics\nor classic hallucinogens\nare things like LSD, psilocybin,\nwhich is in so-called magic mushrooms.\nIt's in over 200 species\nthat we know of so far of mushrooms.\nDimethyltryptamine, or DMT,\nwhich is in dozens and dozens of plants.\nMescalin, which is in the peyote cacti,\nand some other cacti, like San Pedro.\nAnd even amongst these\nclassic psychedelics\nthere are two structural,\nstructural classes.\nSo that's the chemistry.\nThere's the tryptamine-based compounds,\nlike psilocybin and DMT,\nand then there's the\nphenethylamine-based compounds.\nSo these are the basic,\ntwo of the, basically, building blocks\nthat you're starting from,\neither a tryptamine structure\nor a phenethylamine structure.\nBut that's just the chemistry.\nAll of the...\nWhat's more important,\nor at least to someone like me,\nare the receptor effects,\nand then, ultimately, that's\ngoing to have a relationship\nto the behavioral and subjective effects.\nSo all of these classic psychedelics\nserve as agonist, or partial agonists,\nat the serotonin 2A receptor,\nso a subtype of serotonin receptor.\nThen you have these other classes of\ncompounds that you could call psychedelic.\nAnother big one would\nbe the NMDA antagonist.\nSo this would include ketamine, PCP,\nand dextromethorphan,\nsomething I've done some research with,\nwhich folks might recognize\nfrom like Robo-tripping,\nguzzling cough syrup,\nwhich is something kind of like\nhigh school kids are known to do\nwhen they can't get ahold of real drugs,\nthat type of thing.\nSo a large overlap in the\ntypes of subjective effects\nthat you get from those compounds\ncompared to the 2A agonist\nclassic psychedelics.\nBut then you have...\nAnd by the way, this description,\nthis framework I'm describing,\nnot everyone will agree.\nSome people will say,\nno, psychedelic only\nmeans classic psychedelic.\nSo there's different opinions here.\nBut you have, gosh, Salvinorin A,\nwhich is a kappa-opioid agonist,\nwhich again-\n- Where does that come from?\n- Salvia divinorum, it's\na plant that became...\n20 years ago, it sort of popped\nonto the legal high scene,\nand there's a long history of\nthis predating the internet,\ngoing back to like the\nstuff one could order\nin the back of \"High Times Magazine\",\nand most of this stuff\nnever worked, you know?\n[laughs] Or it's like, just\nsmoke enough of anything,\nmaybe you get a little bit lightheaded.\nBut this is one of those things\nthat popped around 20 years ago,\nwhen it quickly got\nthe reputation of like,\nholy shit, this stuff actually works,\nand works really strongly.\nIn these smoked extracts particularly,\npeople have these\nreality-altering experiences\non par with smoked DMT,\nthe classic psychedelic.\nSo often...\nAnd we did the first\nblinded controlled human\nresearch with Salvinorin A.\nSo lots of entity contact.\nSo feeling that you,\nin the experience of one\nis actually interacting\nwith autonomous beings,\nthat type of thing.\nAnd then you have another big one,\nI probably should have mentioned\neven before the Salvinorin A,\nbut you have MDMA,\nwhich really stands in a class by itself.\nSo it's been called an entactogen,\nand-\n- What does that mean?\n- It means like touching within.\nIt sort of alludes to the idea\nthat it can really put someone\nin touch with their emotions.\nIt's also been called an empathogen,\nmeaning it can afford empathy.\nBut I think entactogen's probably,\nthat's the term that I tend to focus on.\nAnd I know I'm not telling\nyou anything you don't know,\nbut for the viewers,\nthe primary mechanism of\nMDMA is serotonin release,\nand to a degree, other monoamine release,\ndopamine, serotonin.\nAnd so structurally,\nthat's also in the phenethylamine class,\nwhich contains mescalin,\nthe classic psychedelic,\nbut also amphetamine.\nSo just like Adderall is\nin that phenethylamine class.\nAnd so this is another example\nwhere chemistry doesn't dictate.\nI mean, you can tweak a molecule.\nIt might have that same basic structure,\nbut now you've profoundly changed the way\nit interacts with the receptor.\nSo in MDMA it does not\nexert its actions by,\nI like to say, by mimicking the\nbaseball entering the glove,\nthe post-synaptic receptor\nside acting as an agonist.\nSo mimicking the endogenous\nneurotransmitter, serotonin,\nlike the classic psychedelics do.\nMDMA works on the pitcher side\nof just basically throwing\nout more of the natural,\nthe endogenous-\n- Dumping\nmore serotonin.\n- Dumping more\nserotonin.\n- Yeah.\n- Flooding the synapse.\n- Yeah.\nSo I get the impression,\nthat this psychedelic space\nis a enormous cloud of\npartially overlapping compounds.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Right.\n- Meaning some are impacting\nthe serotonin system\nmore than the dopamine system.\nOthers are impacting the dopamine system\nmore than the serotonin system.\nGiven that the definition of a psychedelic\nis that it profoundly\nalters sense of self,\nat least that's included\nas a partial definition,\n- Mm-hmm.\n- can we break that down into\na couple of sub categories?\nSo for instance, hallucinating,\neither auditory or visual,\nsynesthesia, perceptual blending,\nthe sense that you can hear colors,\nand see sounds, for instance.\nA common report of people\n- Yeah.\n- that take psychedelics\nin sufficiently high doses.\nSo hallucinating, synesthesia.\nAnd then in terms of sense of self,\nas a neuroscientist, I think,\nokay, what does it mean to\nalter a sense of reality?\nReally, what the brain\ndoes in a very coarse way\nis to try and figure out\nwhat's happening in space, physical space,\nand that physical space could\nbe within us or outside us,\nand what's happening in time.\n- Right.\n- And as a vision scientist,\nthe simplest explanation,\nis when I move my hand\nfrom one location to another location,\nit's measuring the space,\nthe location of my hand\nin space over time,\nand then you get a rate, and a speed,\nand all that kind of stuff,\nright?\n- Yeah.\n- That gets more complicated\nas you get into the emotional realm.\nBut is it fair to say,\nthat psychedelics are impacting\nthe space-time analysis\nthat the brain is performing,\nand thereby creating hallucinations,\nand thereby altering\nthe blending of senses?\nIs it fair to say that?\n- I think it's fair to explore that area,\nand here's what I'm thinking.\nClearly, there is a changed relationship,\ncertainly, at the right dose\nof orientation in space-time.\nI think as a...\nYou know, I'm primarily a behaviorist,\nand in terms of human\nbehavioral pharmacology,\nI always go to comparative\npharmacology, okay?\nWhat can we say that is truly unique\nabout the classic psychedelic,\nor psychedelics in general?\nSo with that description, I'm thinking,\nokay, alcohol can really screw up your\ntime-space orientation.\n- And the proprioception,\nyour balance, your vestibular.\n- Proprioception,\n- Yeah.\n- you know.\nAnd in many ways,\nand sort of in those gross\nmotorways, like far worse,\nof course everything's dose-dependent,\nbut in the classic psychedelics,\nobviously the benzodiazepines\nbeing very similar to alcohol.\nSame thing.\nSo I'd want to dig in a little more,\nin terms of, like, maybe\nthere's something more specific\nwe could say about that\nrelationship to time,\nand space that the psychedelics\nare tinkering with,\nbut I'm not sure.\nIt's an interesting hypothesis,\nthe idea that that's a mediator,\nthat that's something,\nthat there's something fundamental\nabout changing the\nrepresentation in time and space.\nThere might be something to that.\nI mean, I think of these psychedelics\nas profoundly altering models.\nWe're prediction machines.\nSo much of that is top-down.\nAnd psychedelics have a good way of,\nloosely speaking, dissolving those models,\nand one of, the reality-\n- Can you give us\nan example of one of, like a model?\nLike, I know that when I\nthrow a ball in the air,\nit falls down, not up.\nThat's a prediction that\nI learned as a child.\nI did not come into the world with a brain\nthat knew that relationship\n- Yes.\n- between objects and gravity.\nBut one of the first\nthings that a child learns\nis the relationship between\nobjects, and gravity,\nand their trajectory-\n- Yeah.\nAnd with a four-year-old,\nI mean, I saw that at earlier ages,\nlike that experimentation of, like,\noh yeah, that's what happens,\nyou know?\n- Right.\n[interposing voices]\nSo if he were to throw a ball,\nif a child were to throw a ball,\nand it went up into the sky,\nthat would be absolutely mind-blowing?\n- Yeah.\n- It would be\nfor an adult too.\n- It'd be a pretty\n- Right.\n- psychedelic experience,\nprobably [laughs].\n- Right, right.\nThere's a rule there.\nYou're saying, there's kind of\na prediction.\n- Right.\n- There's a rule that\nunderlies a prediction,\nthat when that rule is violated,\nall of a sudden, the circuit,\npresumably, for that prediction,\nit doesn't have a mind of its own,\nbut somehow, it creates\na surprise element,\nor a recognition element.\n- Yeah.\nAnd it's not filtered out, you know?\nAnd this might sound extreme,\nbut there are these cases,\nit was overblown,\nand sort of the propaganda\nof the late '60s, early '70s,\nbut there are credible cases of people,\nit's very atypical of,\nit sounds like they really\nthought they could fly,\nand jump out of a window.\nNow, far more people every year fall.\nI mean, who knows, you know?\n- Sure.\n- They fall and die out of,\nyou know, from height, because\nthey're drunk, you know?\nSo this is extremely rare,\nbut there are some\npretty convincing cases.\nThere was one research\nvolunteer in our studies that,\nshe looked like she was,\nin one of our studies,\nshe was trying to dive through\na painting on the wall.\nShe was fine.\nBut she [laughs]...\nReviewing the video,\nit looked like she really thought\nthat she was going to go\nthrough that painting,\nand who knows?\nYou know what I mean?\n- All right, so-\nSo she was-\n- Into the other dimension-\n- Yeah, so they're\nviolating these predictions.\nYeah, the reason I asked the\nquestion the way I did is,\nbecause given the enormous\ncloud of different substances,\nand given the range of\nprevious experiences\nthat people show up to a\npsychedelic experience with,\nI feel like the ability to extract\nsome universal themes is useful,\nespecially for people who\nhaven't done them before,\nright?\n- Yeah.\n- Who might not have an understanding\nof what their effects are like.\nCan we just briefly touch on\nthe serotonin system\nand the dopamine system?\nI want to acknowledge\nthat, as you already know,\nthat there are many neuromodulator\nsystems in the body,\nand the opioid systems,\ncannabinoid systems.\nBut there's something so profound about\nthe serotonin system\nand the dopamine system,\nbecause the way I define\na neuromodulator is,\nit's a modulator.\nIt changes the way that\nother circuits behave.\nAnd essentially, it\nincreases the probability\nthat certain circuits will be active\nand decreases the probability\nthat other circuits\nwill be active,\n- Yeah.\n- in a general sense.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- So compounds like LSD,\nlysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin,\nmy understanding, is that they primarily\ntarget the serotonin system.\nHow do they do that at\na kind of general level?\nAnd why would increasing the activity\nof a particular serotonin receptor\nor batch of serotonin receptors\nlead to these profoundly\ndifferent experiences\nthat we're calling model challenges,\nchallenging pre-existing models\nand predictions?\n- Yeah.\n- I mean, at the end of\nthe day, it's a chemical,\nand these receptors are\nscattered around the brain\nwith billions of other receptors.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- What do we think is going\non in a general sense?\n- Yeah, yeah, and this is really\nthe area of active exploration,\nand we don't have great answers.\nWe know a good amount about the\nreceptor level pharmacology,\nsome things about post-receptor\nsignaling pathways.\nIn other words, just\nfitting into the receptor.\nClearly, serotonin itself is\nnot psychedelic, you know?\nOr else we'd be tripping, all of us,\nall the time.\n- 'Cause when I eat a bagel,\nI get serotonin release, right?\n- Uh-huh.\n- I mean, there's...\nOr turkey.\n- And it's very\ndifferent than LSD.\n- I mean, there's tryptophan\nin it, right?\n- Mm-hmm.\n- But my understanding of serotonin,\nis that in very broad strokes,\nthat it generally leads to\na state of being fairly,\nit pushes the mind and body\ntowards a state of contentment\nwithin the\n- Right.\n- immediate experience.\nWhereas the dopamine system\nreally places us into an external view\nof what's out there in the\nworld, and what's possible.\n- Yeah.\n- Is that fair to say?\n- Need to do something.\nI mean, that's consistent\nwith my understanding,\nand certainly, not in terms of...\nI don't primarily identify\nas a neuroscientist,\nso I'll definitely tell the viewers\nthat we're far more in\nyour domain here than mine.\nBut in terms of how\npsychedelics and other drugs\ninterface at the neuroscience level.\n- Well, feel free to explain\nit at the experiential level.\n- Yeah.\n- I mean, it doesn't have-\nI think there probably\nare some audience members\nthat are interested in, is it the 5-H2C?\nIs it the layer five neurons\nand cortex?\n- Yeah.\n- That conversation, we could hold,\nand that's an interesting conversation.\nBut just in terms of the\nexperience of serotonergic\nversus dopaminergic drugs,\n- Right.\nYeah.\n- they do seem to create\ndistinct classes of experience.\nSo I think that's\nthe appropriate level\n- Right.\n- for us to discuss them.\n- And in terms of how they...\nAnd I'd like to explore the\nbiology a little bit here,\nand tell you sort of what's known,\nand what some of the ideas are.\n- [Dr. Huberman] Please.\n- You know, have this path...\nAs you know, these are levels of analysis,\nand it's not which one is going on.\nIt's almost like, for\nthe particular question,\nwhich level of analysis\nis most appropriate?\nIs a question best\naddressed by the biology,\nthe chemistry, or the physics?\nThat's how I think of receptor level,\npost-receptor signaling,\ndownstream effects on\nother neuro-transmitters,\nand then activation level effects,\nand then coordination of activation.\nSo you've got the,\nclearly, with the classic psychedelics,\nthe two way activation.\nWe do know that there\nare downstream effects\nin terms of increasing\nglutamate transmission.\nSo this is likely a commonality\nwhy ketamine is very psychedelic\nin a slightly different way,\nbut-\n- Do people\nhallucinate on ketamine?\n- Yes, yes, and it's more dissociative.\nSo someone is more likely to sort of\nbe less behaviorally active.\nIf they have a really high dose,\nthey go into a K-hole,\nand if they go in a really high dose,\nlike you get in surgery,\n- That's what it's called,\n- you're just unconscious.\n- a K-hole?\n- Yeah, a K-hole.\n- Not an A-hole,\nbut a K-hole?\n- A K-hole,\nyeah [laughs].\n- Right.\n- It's very different.\nThe K-hole.\nAnd ketamine's interesting,\n'cause people can take kind of bumps,\nand kind of dance on it\nwith sort of an alcohol\nlevel strength effect,\nand that's sort of the classic\nkind of raving use of it.\nBut then those folks want\nto titrate their dose,\nbecause if they do more of a line,\nyou get up to like 75, 100 milligrams,\nthen you're talkin' about,\nif you're on the dance\nfloor, you're on the floor,\nand your friends are trying to make sure\npeople aren't steppin' on you.\nSo that's like the K-hole-\n- Yeah, why would somebody\nwant to take a dissociative anesthetic?\nLike, to me, it's completely mysterious\nas to why someone would want\nto dissociate from their body.\n- People claim that these\nNMDA antagonist psychedelics\nare extremely insightful\nin a very similar way\nto the experiences with\nthe classic psychedelics.\nSo-\n- And ketamine is now legal\nfor therapeutic use, correct?\n- Right, right.\nSpravato, the intra-nasal\nform marketed by Janssen,\nwhich is esketamine,\nand it's one of the-\n- It's prescription?\n- Yeah, it's prescription-\nand-\n- So people are taking\nit in the nasal spray?\n- Yeah.\n- And then,\nare they undergoing talk therapy\nwhile they're doing this?\n- Typically not.\nThis is very interesting,\nand there's so much work\nthat needs to be done.\nIt's not treated as psychedelic therapy,\nand by that,\npsychedelic therapy, I mean,\nyou tell the person\nthey're going to have\nan altered experience.\nYou tell them to pay\nattention to that experience,\nthat they might learn\nsomething from that experience.\nAnd afterwards, you\ndiscuss that experience.\nWith Spravato,\nthe model is-\n- Spravato is?\n- Is esketamine.\n- Okay.\n- It's the, yeah, the\nspray form of ketamine.\nIt's been FDA-approved for\ntreatment resistant depression.\nYou'll probably feel different.\nIgnore that.\nThat's a side effect.\n[laughs] That's an adverse effect.\nJust ignore it.\nWe don't think that has anything to do\nwith the way it works.\nBut just get this thing.\nIt's a direct sort of\nchemotherapeutic effect in a sense .\nIt's not facilitating a learning process.\nNow, there's older work.\nThere was a guy, Krupitsky, in Russia\nthat did extensive work with\nhigher doses of ketamine.\nI should say, Spravato,\nat the prescribed doses,\nisn't very...\nIt's a pretty low dose.\nIt's in the mild psychedelic range,\nbut it's not very strong.\nBut this older work that happened\nin the '90s and early 2000s in Russia,\nthey were using very high doses,\nand treating it like a psychedelic.\nYou know, treating it as if\nit was a psychedelic therapy.\nIn other words, telling people,\nyou're going to have this experience.\nIt's going to...\nWe're hoping you learn something from it.\nWe're going to help you through it.\nWe're going to discuss it afterwards.\nAnd they found incredibly\nhigh rates of success\nin some pretty well controlled trials\nfor both heroin addiction\nand alcohol addiction.\nSo I think a whole lot of\nwork needs to be done now.\nAnd you see some of the ketamine clinics\nthat are using ketamine off-label,\na lot of them are you treating\nit like psychedelic therapy.\nThere's, essentially, no\nresearch at this point on that.\nDo you get better results?\nStraight up use of Spravato,\nthere's some good variability,\nbut its antidepressant\neffects last about a week,\nbut they kick in immediately.\nNow, a week is a long time.\nFor most psychiatric drugs,\nyou take it every day,\nyou know?\n- Right.\n- So that's amazing, but\nit's still just a week.\nWe're seeing effects a year\nor more later with psilocybin\nand some of the classic psychedelics\nthat could be a\npharmacological difference,\nor it could be that they get\na lot more mileage out of ketamine\nif they treated it like\npsychedelic therapy.\nAnd so that's some work-\n- What would that look like?\n- Really, just like our\npsilocybin sessions,\nwhich I know I haven't described,\nbut briefly, you have anywhere from\nfour to eight hours of preparation\ngetting to know the people\nwho are going to be the guides\nor the therapists in the room\nwith the person.\n- Yeah, maybe you could\nwalk us through this?\nSo let's say, I were to come\nto one of your clinical trials,\n'cause these are\nclinical trials, right?\n- Mm-hmm.\n- At your lab at Hopkins?\n- Yeah.\n- And would I need to be depressed,\nor could I just be somebody\nwho wanted to explore psychedelics?\n- We've had studies for all of these,\n- Okay.\n- and a number\nof other disorders.\n- Okay.\n- So healthy, \"normal studies\",\n- Okay.\n- the code for\nnot a problem to fix, but we're all...\nThat's what's amazing\nabout psychedelics, though,\nbecause if you administer\nthem under this model,\nand you develop a relationship,\nand give a high dose of a psychedelic,\nyou can be a healthy normal\nwithout a diagnosable issue.\nBut man, we're all human,\nand the issues seem to\ncome to the surface.\n- Sure.\nYeah-\n- But we've done\nwork with smoking cessation,\nso people trying to quit tobacco,\nand haven't been successful.\n- So a variety of reasons?\n- Right.\n- So maybe,\nI'll just ask some very simple questions\nthat would kind of step\nus through the process.\nSo let's say I were to sign\nup for one of these trials,\nand I qualified for one of these trials.\nI'd show up.\nYou said, \"I would do\nseveral hours in advance\nof getting to know the\nteam that would be present\nduring this psychedelic journey\"?\n- First, there's screening.\nSo it's kind of like a couple\nof days of both psychiatric,\nlike structured psychiatric interviews\nabout your whole, your past,\nand symptoms across the\nDSM, the psychiatric Bible,\nto see if you might have various disorders\nthat could disqualify you,\nlike the main ones being\nthe psychotic disorders,\nschizophrenia, and also including bipolar.\n- Right.\n- So the manic\nside of bipolar.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- So after that...\nAnd also cardiovascular\nscreening, heart disease.\nAfter that screening,\nthen the preparation.\nYou develop a therapeutic rapport\nwith the people who are going to be\nin the room with you, your guides,\nbut you're also then\ndidactically sort of explained\nabout what the psychedelic could be like,\nand that's kind of a laundry list,\nbecause they're more\nknown by their variability\nthan it's going to...\nIt's not like cocaine.\nYou're going to feel stimulated.\nYou're going to feel\nlike you can do any...\nOr alcohol, you're probably\ngoing to feel more relaxed.\nIt's like...\nI call 'em uppers,\ndowners, and all arounders,\nand the psychedelics\nare the all arounders.\nIt's like, yeah, you could be,\nyou could have the most\nbeautiful experience of your life,\nor the most terrifying\nexperience of your life.\nSo it's this kind of laundry list\nof like the things that could happen,\nso there's no surprises.\n- I think it's so important\nfor people to hear,\nbecause the all arounders,\nyou really can't predict how somebody\nis going to react internally.\n- Right.\n- I want to just briefly\ntouch on something,\nbecause we left that topic.\nBut it occurred to me,\nthat a lot of these\neffects of psychedelics,\nand how they function, et\ncetera, is still very mysterious.\nBut then I recalled to mind,\nthat how most prescription\nantidepressants work\nis also very mysterious.\nThey increase serotonin, or dopamine,\nor epinephrin, et cetera,\nbut why they take weeks on end,\nyou know, several weeks\nto kick in, et cetera,\nis also mysterious.\nBut going back to the experience of\ncoming to your laboratory.\nOkay, so let's say that somebody passes\nall the prerequisites.\nand it's the day.\n- Yeah.\n- Comes the day that they are\ngoing to have this experience.\nAre they eating mushrooms,\nlike you hear about,\nor are they taking it in capsule form?\nWhat sorts of doses are you prescribing?\nIs there a dose response curve?\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- And then secondary to that,\nI'd like to talk about micro dose\nversus macro dose.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- So how do they get this stuff into...\nHow do people receive it,\nand how do they get it\ninto their body?\n- So they reive\npure psilocybin.\nSo the mushroom, and\nthere are many species...\nPeople have taken mushrooms\nin the United States,\nit's most likely so Psilocybe cubensis.\nThey're easy to grow.\nThey grow in cow patties.\nIt's easy for anybody to\ngrow 'em in their closet.\nIt doesn't take a 1,000\nwatt light, like cannabis.\nIt takes like a little 10 watt light bulb\nand a Tupperware bin.\nSo those are what...\nThose are the types of mushrooms\nthat people typically take.\nWe're not administering those.\nPsilocybin is the compound.\nYou could draw a molecule of psilocybin,\nagain, based on the tryptamine structure,\nthat's a single molecular entity.\nSo it's a white powder.\n- Does it look like serotonin molecularly?\n- Yes, yes, yes.\n[interposing voices]\n- If I were to show people\nthe chemical structure of serotonin\nand the chemical structure of psilocybin,\nit would look quite similar?\n- Right, right.\n[interposing voices]\n- They're basically\ntaking serotonin?\n- A modified version of\nserotonin, which makes sense.\nBut then again, this repeated theme of\nthe chemistry doesn't\nalways neatly line up,\nbecause mescaline looks more like dopamine\nthan it does like serotonin,\nbut yet, at the receptor activation level,\nthe pharmalogical effect,\nthose are similar.\nBut yeah, I mean, and what it\ndoes at the receptor is an...\nIt's hitting the same switch,\nbut then having an alternate response\nat the receptor level.\n- Yeah, so for people\nthat don't necessarily understand\nthe relationship between\nwhat we call ligand,\nthe thing that parks in the receptor,\nand the receptor is the parking spot,\none of the reasons that you can get\nsuch a variety of effects\nfrom different compounds is,\nfor instance, serotonin might\naffect a certain pathway\nat a particular rate,\nand a psilocybin might trigger activation\nof different components of\nthat pathway, different rates,\nand so you can get vastly\ndifferent experiences\nfrom two things that\nlook chemically similar.\n- Right.\n- This is also\na good reason why people\nshouldn't just assume\nthat they can cowboy their\nown chemistry, right?\nThat what you see on paper\nand what you can mix up in a vile\nis often vastly different\nthan what you predict.\n- Right.\n- Right.\n- And there's a dose effect\ncurve that's really interesting.\nSome of our early work with\npsilocybin in healthy \"normals\"\nlooked at a true placebo,\nplus four active doses,\n5, 10, 20, and 30\nmilligrams of psilocybin.\nBody weight adjusted,\nso those milligrams per 70\nkilograms of body weight.\nWe've recently published a\npaper in our newer trials\nwhere we're dropping the\nbody weight adjustment,\n'cause going across\nhundreds of volunteers,\nwe've kind of figured out,\nthat you shouldn't really be,\nyou don't need to be adjusting\nby body weight, so-\n- Interesting.\n- So yeah.\n- Well, brain size doesn't vary\nthat much between individuals.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- You know, at the end,\nthis is a brain effect,\nmostly.\n- Yeah.\n- Probably body as well.\nOkay, so the person ingests the powder\nor capsule?\n- Yeah, in a little pill.\n- Okay.\n- Yeah.\nAnd it doesn't take-\n- And how long does it-\n- 30 milligrams is a small...\nHe could fit it into a\ntiny, little capsule.\nAnd it'll take about a half hour.\nWell, anywhere from 15\nminutes to an hour to kick in.\nOn average, about a-\n- And you said,\nthe dose range was?\n- Most of our studies are looking at where\nwe want a psychedelic effect\nduring the 20 to 30 milligram range.\nAgain, because we have\nadjusted by body weight,\nand the average American\nis over 70 kilograms,\nabout 150 pounds,\npeople, in fact, have\ngotten more like 40, 45\nin a lot of cases,\nbut it's still a small pill.\nThe session day itself is not full of,\nfor most of our studies,\nis not full of tasks.\nWe really want to look at\nthe therapeutic response.\nObviously, if it's a therapeutic study,\nwe want it to be a meaningful experience.\nAnd research has found, not surprisingly,\nthat you get a less meaningful experience\nwhen you're an FMRI,\n- Right.\n- ar when you're doing\na lot of cognitive tasks.\nWe've done some research\non of that type, for sure,\nand plenty of colleagues have.\nBut when you're in a therapeutic study,\nor if you're trying to understand\nthe therapeutic effects,\nyou have to recognize\nthere's this trade-off\nof what you can do.\nSo our typical therapeutic model,\nwhich, again, isn't just\nlimited, necessarily,\nto the therapeutic studies\nwhere we're trying to\ntreat a specific disorder,\nis to have that preparation,\nso you the person feels very\ncomfortable with their guides.\nI mean, ultimately, what\nI tell people is like,\nany emotional response, it's all welcome.\nI mean, you could be crying\nlike a baby hysterically,\nlike that's what you should be doing\nif that's what you feel like.\nAnd so in a lot of ways,\nsometimes people with psychedelic\nexperience on their own,\nit can be harder to\ntrain them in this model,\nbecause in the real world,\npeople with psychedelic experience,\na lot of times, the\nrule is hold your shit.\nSo several friends go to a party.\nThey split a bag of mushrooms.\nIt's like there's a social\npressure, for good reason,\nnot to be the guy in\nthe corner of the room,\nwhere everyone's trying to just\nhave a good time and relax,\nlike crying about your mother.\nYour other friends,\nthey're having an experience too,\nand you're being a drama\nking, and blah-blah-blah,\nAnd so, yeah, compose yourself.\nHold your-\n- You're doing-\nI mean, you're doing therapy for people.\nIt's not just about the experience?\n- Right.\nAnd the experience itself\nis very much shaped by that\ncontainer, by the environment,\nand the degree to which\none allows it to happen.\nOnce you let go of control,\nright?\n- Yeah, let's talk about\nthe letting go of control.\nAnd then as we march through\nthis hypothetical experience\nthat does take place in your lab.\nSo we're using a sort of generic\ncase example, if you will.\nThe letting go of control\nis an interesting feature, actually,\nbecause one of the common\nthemes of good psychoanalysis,\nor psychotherapy of any kind,\nis that there's a trust built\nbetween the patient and the analyst,\nand that relationship becomes\na template for trust more generally,\nand trust in one's self.\nIt's actually, the end goal\nof a good psychoanalysis\nis that the patient actually...\nOne of the end goals\nis that they develop an\nempathy for themselves,\nwhich almost sounds like an oxymoron,\nbut if you spend a little\ntime with that statement,\nit actually pans out.\nSo the psychedelic\nexperience is one in which,\nchemically, you're under a\nnew set of conditions, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Let's coarsely,\nspace and time are altered\nin some way, sense of self.\nFor instance, I might be going to\na strongly interoceptive mode\nwhere I'm focusing on\neverything within the confines of my skin.\nWhereas, normally, we're\nsort of interacting in space,\nand pens, and conversation.\n[mumbles] Occasionally, I'll\npay attention to my breathing,\nbut I'm sort of dilating\nand contracting my focus for\ndifferent things all the time.\n- Yeah.\n- The letting go of control,\nit seems, to me, could be sort of\nthe expansion of one perceptual bubble,\nto the point where you're\nnot actually worried\nthat that perceptual bubble\nis going to pop, or that,\nmeaning you're not worried\nabout what people think of you.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\nYou're not worried whether\nor not your brain is going to explode,\neven though a thought could feel enormous.\nIf I keep going like this,\nit almost sounds psychedelic,\nbut that's the idea here.\nOr if I'm paying attention, for instance,\nto some Somatic experience,\nlike the coursing of waves\nof heat through my body,\nthat I'm not suddenly\nsaying, \"Is that weird?\"\nI'm actually just going\ndeeper and deeper into it.\nSo it's, essentially, expanding\na perceptual phenomenon.\nHow do you convince people to go further\nand further down that path?\nWhat do you think allows them to do that?\nBecause I think that, to me,\nis one of the more unusual\naspects to psychedelics,\nis that, normally, the social pressure,\nbut also, just our internal\npressure from our own brain is,\npay attention to many things\nat once, not just one.\nIs that-\n- Especially these days.\nYeah, multi-task.\n- Exactly.\nYeah.\n- Right.\nMultitask.\nAnd the more that we focus on one thing,\nthe more bizarre that thing\nactually can appear to us, right?\n- Right.\n- I mean,\neven if it's the tip of your finger,\nand you're not taking any psychedelics,\nyou spend long enough looking\nat the tip of your finger,\nyou will notice\n- Yeah, it's weird.\n- some very\nweird things.\n- Yeah.\n- Right?\n- I think if that as the\nclassic psychedelic effect,\nor one classic effect,\nand one I've used many times,\nof this example of why\npeople should necessarily...\nThese aren't...\nOne should be judicious\nin putting themselves\nin these circumstances.\nSomeone could be having a very\nstrong psilocybin experience,\nand they're trying to navigate\ntheir way in Manhattan,\ncrossing the street,\nand they might be staring into their hand,\nand realize, like that's,\ntheir hand is the most amazing miracle.\nLike the entire universe\nhas essentially conspired\nto come to this one point\nto make this absolutely breathtaking...\nIt's almost like, I think,\nof the simplest form of...\nWell, we know that the\nsimplest form of learning is habituation.\nSimply keep applying stimuli,\nand there's less response.\nThis is what organisms do.\nThis is what we have to do.\nAnd it's like there's this disc\nhabituation component that-\n- Disc habituation?\n- Yeah, so like we wouldn't\n- Yeah.\n- be able to get through life,\nwe wouldn't be able to cross\nthat street if we were like,\nwhoa, this is a miracle.\nYou know? [laughs]\n- Well, I'm so glad you-\nNo, I'm so glad you brought this up.\nI mean, here, I'm reflecting\nmy bias as a vision scientist,\nbut most people don't realize this,\nbut if you look at something long enough,\nit eventually disappears.\nIt doesn't actually disappear,\nbut perceptually, it disappears.\nYou have these little microsaccades\nthat ensure that it doesn't.\n- Right.\n- But most of us\ndon't look at any one thing for very long.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Right.\n- The brain's default is to\nperceptually jump around like crazy\nwith the visual system,\nwith the auditory system.\nADD, people talk about ADD a lot,\nis sort of baked into our\nunderlying networks at some level,\nand then we can force attention.\nBut it sounds like on psychedelics,\none of the primary goals therapeutically\nis to really drill into one\nof these perceptual bubbles,\nand expand that bubble.\nAnd the safety, it seems,\n- Yeah.\n- is the safety...\nIt's sort of like a permission to do that\nwithout worrying that\nsomething's going to happen.\n- Right.\nBecause I've had people\nthere on the couch...\nYeah, I remember one lady said,\nthis is probably 13, 14 years ago, said,\n\"Matt, tell me again, I can't die\".\n\"I feel like my heart is going\nto rip through my chest.\"\nI mean, she was feeling...\nAnd I should say,\ntypically, cardiovascular\nresponse is modest.\nThe pulse and blood\npressure go up somewhat.\nIt can be dangerous for people\nif they're at severe heart risk,\nand we do-\n- Are you monitoring\nthis the whole time?\n- We do.\nWe do monitor it.\n- So they're plugged into\na variety of devices-\n- Yeah,\nso every half hour or so,\nwe take on protocol,\nand we space it out a little further,\nfurther into the time course,\nbut we take their blood\npressure and their pulse.\nAnd if it goes over a certain level,\nwe have a protocol,\nand we've had to do this only a few times,\nbut the physician comes in,\ngives them a little\nnitroglycerin under the tongue,\nand knocks the blood\npressure down a little bit.\nDoesn't affect the experience.\nSo we have it all in place,\neven though they'd probably be fine,\nout of an abundance of caution.\n- [Dr. Huberman] Sure.\n- But yeah, but someone can feel that,\nmy god, I'm going to die.\nI have never felt my heart\nbeat like this before.\nAnd the experience of the breath\ncan be just absolutely fantastic.\nThis sort of...\nAnd the breath is obviously interesting,\nbecause it's this automatic control,\nbut it can also be voluntary.\nSo people get into a sense of like,\nmy god, what if I...\nIt sounds silly,\nlike a stoner movie-\n- What if I forget to breathe?\n- Exactly.\n- Yeah.\n- That can be so compelling.\nAnd so one of the...\nGet back to one of your questions,\nit's like, what do we do to kind of\nallow them to go further\ninto these bubbles?\nOne, is wearing the eye shades.\nWe don't call 'em blindfolds,\n'cause that has a negative connotation,\nlike peakin' out [laughs].\n- And they're probably seeing\na lot in there anyway.\nSo blind isn't the appropriate\nword for it.\n- Right, right.\nI've never thought of it.\nThis should be like inner-sight shades.\n[interposing voices]\n- But when you close the eyes,\nthe levels of activity in the retina\nactually are maintained.\nIt's just spontaneous activity.\n- And it seems,\nand I'd be curious about your\nthoughts on this, I mean,\nbut the way I describe it,\nis that the mind's eye,\nthis kind of loose term we use,\ncan be on rocket booster.\nSo a lot of times, for some people,\nlike a compound like psilocybin,\nfor some people, there's\nno perceptual effect.\nIf they're looking at this room,\nit would pretty much look the same.\nSometimes, folks say,\n\"Yeah, things seem a little bit brighter\".\nNow, some people will say,\n\"Oh, my god, there's waves\".\n\"That wall is waving,\nand these curtains...\"\nOn these compounds,\npeople don't typically see pink elephants.\nYou do actually get that in another class.\nI didn't mention the anticholinergic,\nsort of like atropine and\nscopolamine, those drugs.\nThose are the true hallucinations,\nwhere you thought you\nwere having a conversation\nwith someone who was never there.\n- Right.\n[interposing voices]\nWe will definitely get to those.\nBut the reason I kind of cringe,\nand I say, \"Oh, my\", when\nyou talked about those,\nis that knowing a little bit\nabout the pharmacology of acetylcholine,\nthe idea of manipulating\nthat system, to me,\nsounds very uncomfortable.\nBecause the whole idea\nof witches and flying,\nthere was a whole history\nthere hundreds of years ago,\nso-called witches taking these agents,\nand then thinking they were\nflying around on broomsticks,\nand things of that sort.\n- Yeah.\n- And there's a lot of mythology\naround the broomsticks.\nIt's complicated.\nBut that sounds very unpleasant.\nOne thing about the serotonergic,\nlet's just, for with psilocybin,\nso there's an expansion of a particular,\nfairly narrow, percept.\nIt could be sound.\n- Yeah.\n- It could be an emotion.\nIt could be sadness.\nCould be a historical event,\nor a fear of the future.\n- Yes.\n- And you've mentioned before,\nthat there's something to be\nlearned in that experience.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- There's something about\ngoing into that experience\nin an undeterred way\nthat allows somebody\nto bring something back\ninto more standard reality.\n- Yeah.\n- Given the huge variety of experiences\nthat people have on psychedelics,\ngiven the huge variety of\nhumans that are out there,\nbut what are now very clear\ntherapeutic effects in\nthe realm of depression,\nwhat do you think is the\nvalue of going into this\nfairly restricted perceptual bubble,\nwhat we are calling, letting\ngo, or giving up control?\nBecause if the experiences are many,\nbut the value of what one exports\nfrom that experience is kind of similar\nacross individuals,\n- Yeah.\n- that raises all sorts\nof interesting questions.\nAnd this is not a philosophy discussion.\nWe're talking about biology\nand psychology here.\n- Yeah.\nSo let's say, I decide\nthat I'm going to focus on\nthe tip of my pen.\nI mean, in a psychedelic state,\nI could fall in love with this pen.\nI do happen to like these Pilots V5s\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\nand V7s very much.\nBut I could feel real love\n- Yeah.\n- for the pen,\nright?\n- Yeah.\n- That's not an\nunreasonable thing to expect\nin a psychedelic journey.\n- Right, right.\n- And in the context\nof your laboratory model,\nwhich I think is a great one,\nthat experience will be just as valid\nas me going into the experience\nof some of the deep\nfriction that I might have\nwith a family member\nover my entire lifespan.\n- Yeah.\n- And yet,\nthe export from that,\nthose two vastly different experiences,\nis one of feeling a better\nrelationship to the world\ninto one's self.\n- Right.\n- So what does this\ntell us about-\n- How can the pen,\n- Right.\n- and the processing\nyour childhood trauma\nboth lead to-\n- Right.\n- Yeah-\n- So what does this...\nI mean, at that level,\n- Yeah.\n- it raises this question, like,\nfirst of all, how, why,\nI mean, or just, what are\nyour thoughts on that?\n- So this is definitely in the...\nThis is in the terrain we're\nfiguring out, you know?\nSo there's no...\nEducated speculation is\nthe best I can provide.\nbut I think the best...\nI think the common denominator\nare persisting changes\nand self-representation.\n- Okay, tell me more\nabout self-representation.\nYeah.\n- That's the way\none holds the sense of self,\nthe fundamental relationship\nof a person in the world.\nI mentioned earlier, that these experience\nseems to alter the models\nwe hold of reality,\nand I think the self is the biggest model,\nthat I am a thing that's\nseparate from other things.\nI am defined by certain...\nI have a certain personality,\nand I'm a smoker that's\nhaving a hard time quitting,\nor I'm a depressed person that\nviews myself as a failure,\nand all of these things,\nthose are models too.\nAnd I think that change\nin self-representation\nmay be an endpoint for\nthese different experiences.\nI mean, maybe the falling\nin love with the pen,\nthe whole idea that you're,\nespecially in contemplation afterwards,\nand obviously, I'm speculating here,\nbut the whole idea that you could\nhave such a deep connection\nwith this random,\nobviously, random, aspect of the universe\ncould potentially lead to this\ntransformed understanding of the self,\nand the pen may be a proxy\nfor the miracle of reality\nin a way that relies nothing on,\non no supernatural thinking.\nYou know, you can be a hard\natheist, and you take this,\nyou know, ultimately,\noh, my god, like that,\njust like the pen,\nthis is amazing, the fact that we exist,\nand so there could be\nan extrapolation chair.\nAnd you used the pen,\nbut I think it sounds similar to\nAldous Huxley's classic description\nand the doors of perception\nof the chair and the drapes.\nHe took 500 milligrams of mescalin,\nand he was just like-\n- Is that a\nhigh dose of mescalin?\n- Yeah, yeah,\nand that's a heroic dose, for sure.\nHe's just going off of the\nchairiness of the chair,\nlike this chair is exuding\nthe quality of being a chair,\nand-\n- So this is this\nexpansion of the perceptual bubble?\nA narrow percept that then grows within\nthe confines of that narrow percept?\n- Yeah.\n- So a sense of self is a\nvery interesting phenomenon,\nand if we could dissect it a little bit,\nthere's the somatic sense of self,\nso the ability to literally feel the self.\nThis process, we call interoception.\nAnd then there's the\nthe title of the self,\nthe I am blank.\n- Yeah.\n- And I noticed\nyou said that several times,\nand it's intriguing to me.\nBut a good friend,\nI don't think I can or\nshould mention his name,\nbut he had a very long\nand successful career\nwithin one of the more elite\nteams within the SEAL teams,\nand he's a fairly philosophical guy,\nalso a very practical guy,\nbut he has said many times to me,\nthat the most powerful words\nin any language are \"I am\",\nbecause whatever follows that tends,\nif you repeat it enough,\ntends to have this kind\nof feedback effect on\nhow you are in the world.\nThe first pass,\nit sounded to me a little\nbit like, you know,\nkind of like internet\npsychology-type-thing,\nlike, oh, the secret\nor something you'd say,\nwhich frankly,\nI'm just not particularly-\n- A little New Agey.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- [mumbles] If you kind of like\nthe whole fake it till you make it,\nI don't actually subscribe to any of that.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Uh-huh.\n- But in dissecting that a\nlittle bit further with him,\nI came to realize,\nthat these words, \"I\nam\", are very powerful.\nI don't think you reprogram\nyour brain just by saying them.\nBut how one defines themselves internally,\nnot just to other people,\nbut how one psychologically,\nand by default,\ndefines themselves, I\nthink, is very powerful.\nAnd depressed people,\nas well as happy people,\nseem to define themselves\nin terms of these categories\nof emotional states.\nSo I think it's so interesting,\nthat letting go and going\ninto this perceptual bubble,\nwhich is facilitated by, obviously,\na really wonderful team of therapists,\nbut also, the serotonergic agent,\n- Yeah.\n- allows us\nto potentially reshape\nthe perception of self,\nthat's a tremendous\nfeat of neuroplasticity.\n- Right.\nAnd I think, certainly,\nmore work needs to be done.\nThis is the horizon.\nAnd I actually credit Chris Letheby,\na philosopher in Australia,\nwho has a forthcoming book.\nIt might be out right about now, or soon,\nwithin the coming months,\n\"Psychedelics and Philosophy\".\n- That's the title of the book?\n- It might be \"Psychedelic Philosophy\"?\n- Okay.\n- It's really-\n- Chris Letheby.\nWe'll put a link to it-\n- Right.\nAnd so his conclusion in this,\nit's a really great book,\nand he really plays with the idea,\nit's like, psychedelic\nexperiences come along\nwith a lot of supernatural\nstuff, experience.\nIt can certainly go along with that.\nBut the idea is like,\ncan these experiences,\nand including those therapeutic effects,\nbe explained from a\nnaturalist point of view?\nAnd his conclusion is that,\nthe changes in self representation\nmay be the commonality.\nNow, that could go along\nwith plant spirits,\nand the Buddha, and chakras,\nand whatever your model\nsystem, in Jesus, all of that,\nbut it could also be completely devoid\nof any supernatural, any religious.\nAnd we do, in fact, see\nall of these varieties.\nSo I think there's something about this\nchange in sense of self.\nIt seems to be something on the\nidentity level, both with...\nI think of the work we\ndid with cancer patients\nwho had substantial depression\nand anxiety because of their cancer,\nand also our work with people\ntrying to quit cigarette smoking.\nI mean, there's this real...\nThere seems to be, when it really works,\nthis change in how people view themselves,\nlike with smoking,\nlike really stepping out\nof this model of like,\nI'm a smoker, it's tough\nto quit smoking cigarettes.\nI can't do it.\nI failed a bunch of times.\nI remember one participant\nduring the session,\nbut he held onto this afterward, said,\n\"My god, it's like I\ncan really just decide,\nlike flicking off a button,\nI can decide not to smoke\".\nI call these duh experiences\nwith psychedelics,\n'cause people often, like in\nthe cancer stage, you say,\n\"I'm causing most of my own suffering\".\nI can follow my appointments.\nI can do everything,\nbut I can still plan for the...\nI'm not getting outside in the sunshine.\nI'm not playing with my grandkids.\nI'm choosing to do that.\nAnd it's like, they told\nthemselves that before,\nand the smoker has told themselves\na million times, I can...\nSo it sounds...\nWhen it comes out of their mouths,\nfolks will say,\nthis is part of the ineffability\nof a psychedelic experience,\nfolks say, \"I know this\nsounds like bullshit\nand this sounds like,\nbut my god, I could just sigh\",\nlike they're feeling\nthis gravity of agency,\nwhich I think is interesting,\ncause regardless of the debates\non the reality of freewill,\nI think the philosophy of that,\nwhether it's ultimately free will,\nlike pure agency, if that exists,\nwhich I'm skeptical of,\nor just the idea, that clearly,\nwe have a sense of agency.\nThere's something there,\nwhether it's the sense of agency even,\nthe human being has,\nand that seems to be, at times,\nfundamentally, supercharged\nfrom a psychedelic experience.\nThis idea like, I'm just\ngoing to make a decision.\nLike normally, like you\ntell a depressed person,\ndon't think of yourself that way.\nYou're not a failure.\n- They can't do it.\n[interposing voices]\n- It's just, yeah.\nIt's like-\n- Right.\n- Well-\n- But you can, actually,\nin one of these states,\nhave an experience where\nyou realize, like, my god.\nJust like using MDMA to treat PTSD,\nand we're going to be starting work\nwith psilocybin to treat PTSD,\nsomeone could really\nreprocess their trauma\nin a way that has lasting effects.\nAnd clearly, there's\nprobably something that...\nYou know, reconsolidation\nof those memories,\nthey are altered,\nvery consistent with our understanding\nof the way memory works.\nSo the whole idea, people can actually,\nin a few hours, have a\nsuch a profound experience\nthat they decide to make these changes\nin who they are, and it sticks,\nthere seems to be something like that.\n- And that's profound.\nI mean, I think, a few moments ago,\nI made a some semi-disparaging statements\nabout things like the\nsecret, and affirmations,\nand the reason I do that\nwith a nod to the fact that the people\nwho are putting those ideas forward\nare well-intentioned people,\nis that the neural networks of\nthe brain put language last.\nWe tell stories, you know?\nAnd stories are very powerful.\nBut I think one of the most cruel aspects\nof the whole self-help\nliterature in popular psychology\nis this idea, that everything you say,\nyour brain and body hear it.\nThat's actually a very unkind\nor even cruel thing for\npeople who are depressed\nor anxious to hear,\nbecause if they hear\nthat, and believe that,\nand I want to be clear,\nI don't think it's true,\nthat they think that it's\nvery hard to control thoughts.\nIs it very hard to control thoughts?\nSo if somebody says, \"I can't\",\nand then somebody says,\n\"Well, no, every time you say you can't,\nyour brain hears that,\nand it reinforces it\",\nthat's a very treacherous place to live.\nAnd language is powerful,\nbut neural networks, the brain,\nand the networks that\nunderlie emotionality,\nand perception, and sense of self,\nthey don't change in response to language.\nThey change in response to experience.\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- And just fundamentally,\nthere are some prerequisites.\nYou need certain neuromodulators present,\nlike serotonin or dopamine.\nYou need them to be at sufficient levels.\nYou don't need a drug\nnecessarily to do it.\nYou give a kid a kitten or a puppy,\ntheir first kitten or puppy,\nand the levels of dopamine and serotonin,\nI've never measured them,\nbut we can be pretty sure\nthat they are higher than baseline,\nand that experience will\nreshape them, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Likewise with an adult\nin certain circumstances.\nSo I think I'm fascinated by this idea,\nthat a somatic and a\nperceptual experience,\nbut a real experience of the\nsort that you're describing,\n- Yeah.\n- is what allows us\nto reshape our neural circuitry,\nand to feel differently about ourselves.\nAnd I know there's been\nreally tremendous success\nin many individuals of\nalleviating depression,\nof treating trauma with\nthese different compounds.\nI wanted to step from\nthe experience under the\neffects of the psychedelic.\nSo the person there with your team,\nthey go into this expanded\nperceptual bubble.\nIf things go well,\nthey're able to do that\nto a really deep degree.\nMaybe it's the relived trauma?\nMaybe it's the beauty of their ability\nto connect to things in the world?\nAnd I want to talk about the\ntransition out of that state,\nand then the export into life,\nbecause this is really where the\npower of psychedelic seems to be\nin the therapeutic sense,\nis the ability to learn, truly\nlearn, from that experience,\nso that the learning becomes the default.\nThat one doesn't have\nto remind themselves,\noh, I am...\nYou know, they don't have\nto do an affirmation,\nI am a happy person, I am a...\nYou know, I always think of\nBart Simpson\n- Right\n- writing on the chalkboard.\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\n- Yeah.\n- It didn't work for him\nIt doesn't work for this other stuff too.\nSo as they transition out of this state,\nI know that there's a\nkind of a heightened,\nthere's a so-called peak,\n- Yeah.\n- where everything seems to be\nkind of cascading in at such\na level that the person just,\nthey can't really turn\nit off at that point.\n- Right.\n- It would be challenging.\nAnd then they start to exit\nthe effects of the drug.\nAre those transition zones,\nare those valuable,\nmuch like is the\ntransition between a dream\nand the waking state valuable?\nBecause you're in a sort of\nmishmash of altered reality\nand new reality.\n- Right.\n- What do you do to\nguide people through the,\nout the tunnel,\nas they exit the tunnel?\n- Yeah.\nAnd I have to say,\nthis is where we need\nmore experimentation.\nReally, the clinical model goes back\nto literally the late 1950s,\nand there's been virtually\nno experimentation on,\nlet's say, randomized people to...\nWe're going to talk more\nduring the latter half of\nthe session, versus not.\nVersus we have them\nwrite an essay after\ntheir session, versus not.\nVersus we have this amount of integration.\n[interposing voices]\n- In your studies,\nare they writing or talking\nas they're doing it?\n- So-\nAnd it's called a very loosey\ngoosey term, integration,\nbut for us means,\nas they're coming back\nfrom the experience,\nso sort of five, six hours in,\nso this is the afternoon,\nthey've been dosed around nine o'clock,\nso this is like four o'clock or so,\njust some initial, tell\nus about the experience.\nDo you want to...\nNot unpacking it totally,\nbut just kind of initially\njust have a little bit of\ndiscussion before they go home.\nSo there's a little bit of that.\nBut then, that night, their\nhomework is to write something.\nSo it could be a few bullet points.\nIt could be 20 pages.\nAnd we get everything in that range.\nBut try not to be self-critical.\nIt's not graded.\nThis is just to process,\nand for a point of\ndiscussion the next day.\nSo they write something,\nthey come in the next\nday for one to two hour,\ndepending on the study,\n\"integration session\",\nbasically, let's discuss your experience.\nAnd depending on what study it's in,\nlike what that mean for...\nYou're dealing with cancer,\nwhat might that mean for your smoking,\nor becoming a non smoker?\nSo you encourage them to\nsimply take it seriously.\nAnd I think this is, again, a sort of,\none of the points that\ncould be the antithesis\nof what some just kind\nof social users use.\nI mean, this was written\nabout by Huston Smith,\nthe scholar of religion,\nin terms of these mystical experiences\nthat can happen from psychedelics,\nand how a lot of times,\nthe attribution to a\ndrug effect is dismissed.\nEven if one has this sense of\nbeing one with the universe,\nand it totally shakes\ntheir soul, so to speak,\nbut the next day, their friends are like,\nah, dude, you were screwed up!\nToo much acid for you!\nWhoo!\nYou know?\nLike, man, next time, you\nneeded to have a few more beers\nto bring that down.\nYou know, like this sort\nof social reinforcement\nfor dismissing the experience.\nOh, god, you were talking\nout of your head, man.\nEven if it's good natured,\nbut it's this dismissal.\nIt's not like...\nWhat you want to do is like,\ntell me more about that.\nYou know, you were crying at one point\nin talking about your mom.\nLet's talk about that.\nWhat was that like?\nDo you remember that?\n[interposing voices]\n- Are you doing that follow-up,\nor they're encouraged to\ndo that in their own life\nwith the various people in their life?\n- Both.\nSo we do that explicitly in the follow-up,\nwhere we have these discussions.\nDepending on what the situation is,\nyou might encourage the\nperson to kind of follow-up.\nIt's really, the basics of\nit is, is supportive therapy.\nIt's non-structured.\nIt's use all the reflective listening,\nand the sort of the\nhumanistic psychology thing,\nunconditional positive\nregard for the person.\nBut I think, if someone feels inclined\nto apologize to their\nsibling about some things,\nlike, yeah, go ahead and call 'em up.\nWith something big, like\na relationship change,\nI'd be like, sit on that two weeks.\nDon't make any big...\nDon't end any relationship.\nDon't quit your job.\nDon't make any big-\n- Do you also tell them\nnot to start any relationships?\n- I don't remember that ever coming up.\n- Interesting.\n- But if it-\n- I'm not joking.\nI was just wondering, you know?\n- Yeah.\n- But it makes sense\nwhy you would want-\n- Like if they're dating,\nand they're thinking like,\nah, it might be time to\ntake it to the next level.\nShould I ask this girl to marry me?\nIf it did come up, I would say there too,\nwhy don't you sit on that\na week or two?\n- Yeah,\ndon't get a puppy.\n- And let your sober mind-\n- Don't get a puppy.\nCertainly, don't get four puppies\nuntil your...\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\nI have a question about flashbacks.\n- Uh-huh.\n- You know, one of the kind of things\nyou hear is flashbacks,\nand that people-\n- Yeah.\n- Do people get flashbacks?\nAnd if so, what is the\nbasis of flashbacks?\nThe on-the-street lore about this,\nis that, somehow, some of the compound\ngets stored in body fat tissues,\nand then released later.\nLike, is that complete nonsense?\n- No evidence for that,\nso probably complete nonsense.\n- Flashbacks are nonsense,\nor the storage in body\nfat is complete nonsense?\n- The storage in body fat.\nSo to answer whether flashbacks\nare complete nonsense,\nwe have to define it.\nSo I really think\nthese are multiple\nconstructs that are going.\nIt's not the same thing\nthat fall under that term.\nThere is a phenomenon that appears real,\nthat's called hallucinogen-persisting\nperceptual disorder.\nIt's in the DSM.\nA certain number of people,\na very small number of\npeople percentage-wise\nwho have used psychedelics,\nwill have these persisting\nperceptual disorders,\nlike they'll see halos around things.\nThey'll see some trails,\nlike the after image is\nfollowing an object in motion.\nThey'll see distortions in color.\nAnd it'll be like anything else\nthat's a disorder in the DSM.\nIt has to be clinically distressing,\nand it has to be persisting\nover some number of months.\nAnd so very rare, very mysterious.\nSome of the keys to that are,\namazingly, it's never been seen\nin the thousands of participants,\neither from the older era,\nfrom the late '50s to the early '70s,\nthe people in psychedelic\nstudies with LSD,\npsilocybin, mescalin,\nand it's never been\nseen in the Modern Era,\nagain, now with thousands of participants\nat a number of centers like\nours throughout the world.\nSo it seems to be something that is,\nfor some reason, happening in illicit use.\nSo now that brings in,\nokay, is there polypharmacology?\n- Right.\n- You know,\n'cause you're drinking-\n- Did you take\nwhat you thought you took?\n- Yeah.\nWhat's the dose?\nWhat's the purity?\n- Yeah.\n- But then also, what I think\nis actually even more so,\nand what's likely going on,\nis some sort of very rare\nneurological susceptibility.\nThere is one paper that is\na case series of individuals\nreporting these symptoms,\nand they didn't limit it to\njust people who had had\nhallucinogen history.\nAnd the amazing thing about this,\nis that a number of people\nseem to have straight up\nHPPD diagnosis.\n- What is HPPD?\n- Hallucinogen-persisting\nperceptual disorder,\nwho have never taken a psychedelic.\nSo it's often prompted by\nalcohol, benzodiazepines,\ncannabis, even tobacco.\nAnd I believe, in one individual,\nno lifetime history of any,\nit wasn't proceeded by any\nof those substance uses.\nSo I think it's...\nI think of it like\nthe precipitation exacerbation\nof psychotic disorders.\nIt seems pretty clear through observation\nthat some people with\neither predisposition\nor active psychotic disease,\nthat this can destabilize them.\n- Yeah.\n- A psychedelic-\nThe same way that a life experience\ncan destabilize this\n- Sure.\n- person more easily.\nI think of it like that.\nThere's probably some\npretty rare neurological susceptibility.\nWe have tended, this\ngoes back to the '80s,\nclinical practice, it ended up in the DSM\nfocused on hallucinogen,\nbecause I relate it to the\npsychology of xenophobia.\nIt's always the weird other\nthing that gets the attribution.\nYou don't attribute to the thing,\nlike, oh yeah. did you smoke cigarettes?\nDid you drink?\nIt's like, well, yeah,\nbut I see lots of people drinking,\nand not ending up with this.\nYou take a crazy drug,\nand you can get people to believe\nall sorts of crazy stuff.\nThe biggest example of that\nis the cathinone derivatives,\nso-called bath salts.\nAnd if you remember,\nseveral years back,\n- Oh, yeah.\nWhat was the deal with that?\n- the guy in Florida\nthat ate the other guy's face.\nThere was a homeless guy\nthat literally ate part\nof someone's face off.\nYeah, it's one of the crazies-\n- While the person was alive?\n- While the person was alive.\nAnd all it took was one\nsheriff's deputy to say,\n\"Well, I don't know,\nbut I bet it was some\nof that bath salt stuff\nthat's been going on\".\nThe only thing-\n- What was it?\n- [Dr. Matthew] The only thing\nin his system-\n- Well, maybe we can\nset the record straight for people.\nWhat was this...\nWhy would he say bath salts,\nand was it bath salts?\n- It wasn't.\nAnd so the only thing\nin his tox was cannabis,\nwhich we all know,\ntypically, people don't\neat people's faces off\nafter they get stoned.\n- It makes you hungrier,\nbut not that hungry.\n- [laughs] Yeah.\nRight.\n- Yeah.\n- Right.\nSo it's just an example of the xenophobia.\nToday, if you get on Google Images,\nand look up bath salts,\none of the most common images you'll see\nis this poor guy's face being eaten off.\nSo we're just so ready to latch on.\nJust like the people of another\nculture that we don't know,\nit's very easy to assign attribution\nto a class that you're\nvery unfamiliar with.\nSo I think they, the psychedelics,\ngot that attribution\nwith this very rare\nneurological susceptibility,\nthe way that alcohol didn't.\nSo I think it's not\nspecific to psychedelics,\nbut we don't really know.\nBut we'd look at it,\nand our research have never\nseen an example of it.\nBut flashbacks can mean\na number of other things.\nI think the most common\nthing people experiences is,\nwhat we call, state-dependent learning.\nIt's returning yourself\nto a similar context\ncan bring back the same thoughts\nand emotions as the experience.\nSo someone used mushrooms a week ago,\nnow they do something like\nthey smoked some cannabis,\nor they take a warm bath,\nor they're simply relaxed,\nand it seems to come out of the blue,\nand all of a sudden, these,\nor they follow a thought\ntrail that takes them,\nthat reminds them of their,\nand they find themselves in\nthat same experience again,\nI think that's more of\nstate-dependent learning.\nIt's not the distressing\ncomponent that is in,\nand it's typically not perceptual.\nAnd then another class are just sort of\nperceptual anomalies within a day\nor two following the\nexperience, which is not HPPD.\nMost people have joked\nthat this is a free trip.\nLike you might see a few trails\nor halos the day afterwards.\nIt doesn't last longer than that.\nAnd it doesn't screw you up.\nIt's kind of fun,\nlike, \"Oh yeah, I'm\nstill seeing some trip\",\nmost people will say.\nSo it could mean any of those things.\n- Got it.\n- So the flashback is...\nYeah-\n- Interesting.\nNo, I appreciate you clarifying that.\nI mean, one very common\nmisconception about neuroplasticity\nis that it's an event.\nAnd it's not an event, it's a process.\nAnd we have no understanding\nof the duration of that process.\nHowever, the experience of any drug\nor any life experience, right?\nEven if it's a trauma, or\na wonderful experience,\nor a psychedelic experience,\nit doesn't matter,\nsets in motion a series\nof dominoes that fall,\nand it's the falling of those dominoes\nthat we call neuroplasticity.\nI mean, the reshaping of neural\ncircuits could take years.\nWe don't know.\nIt's the trigger,\nand then there's the actual change.\nAnd so I think that some\nof what you described\ncould be, literally, the\nreordering of circuitry,\nthat in some individuals, might\nextend longer than others.\nAnd there is one phenomenon\nthat I've been told people experience,\nand I'm wondering\nwhether or not any of the\npatients you've worked with,\nor people in your trials\nhave ever reported this?\nI've never done ayahuasca,\nwhich I'm assuming has some overlap\nwith the serotonin system.\nProbably hits a\nvariety of systems.\n- So it's DMT,\nthe active-\n- Right.\n- It's orally-\n- Excuse me, that's right.\n- It's NAO inhibitors\n- Of course.\nOf course.\n- that allow the\n- Yeah.\n- DMT to be orally-\n- Right, I should've recalled that.\nAbsolutely.\nWell, I've never done it,\nbut a number of people I know\nthat have done ayahuasca,\nas well as people I know who've done MDMA,\nreport an increased sense of\nwhat is sometimes called ASMR,\nor these autonomic sensory\nmeridian reflexes, which is...\nAnd it's interesting,\na lot of people have these\nnaturally, and they hide these.\nIt's actually something that many people\nkeep hidden to themselves.\nI'll just ask you, if you can do it.\nSo some people are able to pass\nlike a shiver down their spine,\nor up their spine, consciously.\nYou know, like you can kind of.\nI'm able to actually pass\na shiver up my spine.\nI actually learned how to do this\nwhen I was a kid on a hot day.\nI was standing on a field in sports camp.\nI was like, it's really hot here.\nAnd I could actually\ncreate like a cooling,\ncooled perception.\n- Yeah.\n- I told someone this once,\nand then this led to a discussion of,\noh, I can do it,\nbut I always hid that from people,\n'cause it's actually somewhat pleasurable.\nAnd this is a\nwell-known phenomenon, ASMR.\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\nAnd some people I know\nwho have taken MDMA\ntherapeutically, or ayahuasca,\nwill report that they feel\ngreat relief from this.\nThey can generate these autonomic reflexes\nthrough their body more readily.\nProbably, I'm guessing,\nbecause they were able to tune in\nto a kind of deeper sense of somatic self.\nNow, on the internet,\nASMR, if you look it up,\nit's a little bit like\nthe bath salt thing,\nbut in the other direction.\nLike there were people that pay...\nLet's just say, there\nare accounts on YouTube\nthat have many, many millions of viewers\nof people that will\nwhisper to them about...\nLike, for instance, there's\npeople that will go listen to,\nit seems to be women in particular,\nwhispering about like car\nmechanics, or something,\nor scratching.\nSo there are certain\nsounds that will do this.\nWhispering, tapping, finger tapping.\nAnd people experience\nimmense pleasure from it.\nIt's not really sexual pleasure,\nbut it's this kind of\ndeep core of the body.\n- Yeah.\n- It's the autonomic\nnervous system down in the\ncurve of the spine.\n- Probably what a\ncertain number of people\nwould call Kundalini,\nwhich is another one-\n- Right.\n- Scientifically who'd...\nYeah.\n- That's right.\n- Yeah.\n- People who do\nlong duration Kundalini\nbreathing sessions,\nmany of them will report\nlater feeling as if\ntheir perception of self\nis outside of their head.\n- Ah!\n- That they're literally...\nIt's very uncomfortable for them.\nThat they feel like they're walking around\nwith their sense of self\nextended beyond the body.\nAnd this is a clinically\ndescribed neurologic phenomenon.\n- Have any studies been done?\n- No.\n- I would imagine, that\nperson might actually like...\nWould they duck?\n- Oh, what-\n- If they're-\nThat would be\nan interesting experiment-\n- And that would be\nthe kind of thing my lab\nwould want to get into.\n- Where they could-\n- That's right.\n- Yeah,\ntheir body could clear,\n- Right.\nRight.\n- but their projection\n- Yeah.\n- wouldn't?\n- Yeah, the sense of self,\nI mean, there's a well-known phenomenon.\nIn a few individuals, it's very sad,\nwhere people actually avidly seek out\namputation of their limbs,\nbecause their limbs, they feel,\ndon't belong to their body.\n- Oh, yeah.\nYep.\n- This is very sad,\nand fortunately, very rare,\nbut also a very sad condition.\nAnyway, I think that the\ncore of this conversation\nthat we're drilling into is,\nthis notion of reordering the self.\nAnd it's a relief to me to know\nthat flashbacks are not\nsomething that is kind of,\nforgive the term [chuckles],\nbaked into to the psychedelic experience.\nAnd I suppose, that's a\ngood segue to ask about\nother sorts of drugs.\nHaving said, \"baked in\",\nthe temptation is to go to marijuana\nor cannabis.\n- Yeah [laughs].\n- But if we could,\nI'd like to just ask about\nsome of the more dopaminergic compounds.\nIn particular, MDMA.\n- Yeah.\n- My understanding, is the MDMA\nis a purely synthetic compound,\nthat you're not going\nto find MDMA in nature.\n- So far.\n- So far.\n- There are certain-\nDMT was first synthesized in the lab,\nand then we thought it\ndidn't exist in nature,\nand then Richard Schultes\nfound it everywhere\n[laughs] in South America.\n- Yeah, actually-\nYeah-\n- So who knows,\na plant out there\n- Right.\n- might be making MDMA.\n- Right.\nRight.\n- But as far\nas we know now, no.\n- Right.\nAnd we'll talk about DMT and\nits sources within the body.\nBut MDMA could exist in elsewhere,\nbut has been synthesized.\nAnd my understanding, is the MDMA leads to\nvery robust increases in both dopamine\nand serotonin simultaneously,\nwhich, from a neural networks perspective,\nis a very unusual situation, right?\nNormally, because dopamine puts us\nin this exteroceptive,\nlooking outside ourselves,\nseeking things in the world\nbeyond the skin, our own skin,\nand dopamine, excuse me, serotonin\ntends to focus us inward.\nThose are almost mutually exclusive\n- Yeah.\n- kind of\nneurochemical states,\nbut they're always\n- Yeah.\n- at different levels.\nSo why would it be,\nthat having this increased\ndopamine and increased serotonin\nwould provide an experience\nthat is beneficial?\nAnd how do you, to the extent\nthat you can describe it,\nhow do you think that experience differs\nfrom the sorts of experiences\nthat people have on psilocybin\nor more serotonergic agents,\njust broadly speaking?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nIn terms of the effects, generally,\non serotonin and dopamine,\nI can only speculate sort of,\nis that dopaminergic\ncomponent necessary for...\nLet's say, we know that the amygdala\nis less reactive under acute effects,\nand that may play a role in...\nThere's less sort of\ncontrol from the amygdala,\nin terms of one's experience of memory,\nso it may be part of this\nsort of reprocessing,\nthis reconsolidation of these\nmemories in a different way,\nwhere the amygdala is\nnot like going crazy,\nsaying, freak out,\nlike fight or flight.\n- What I should have said,\nit seems like MDMA is being\nused clinically, anyway,\nmainly for trauma,\n- Right.\n- not just for depression, sorry.\n- Although part of that,\nwe really don't know,\nand maybe the MDMA is\ngreat for depression,\nand some of these other.\nAnd it may be that,\nand I'm going to be looking at this soon,\nthat psilocybin is\ngreat for treating PTSD.\nA lot of underground therapists say that,\nunderground psychedelic therapists.\nSo we don't really know yet-\n- What do you mean\nby underground?\nOh, because they're doing it-\n- People doing illegal,\n- Yeah.\n- but more like\na professional therapist would.\nIt's just illegal.\nAnd this is a kind of a growing thing.\nSo we don't really know which.\nSpeculating, but it may be that MDMA,\nfor a broader number of people,\nis better for trauma,\nbecause the chances of having\nan extremely challenging experience,\nwhat I call the bad trip,\nlike really freaking out,\nis much lower with MDMA.\nPeople can have bad trips,\nbut they're of a different nature.\nIt's not-\n- Well, what is-\n- It's not sort of like freaking out,\nbecause all of reality\nis sort of shattering,\nand it's less of this.\nIt can take so many forms\nwith the classic psychedelics,\nbut typically, you'll hear something like,\nI didn't know it was\ngoing to be like this.\nNo matter how hard you\ntried to prepare them,\nthat like this is...\nLike get me off this-\n- You're talking about LSD\nor psilocybin?\n- LSD, psilocybin,\nayahuasca.\n- Bad trip.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nAnd just this sense of\nlike, I'm going insane.\nThis is so far beyond anything\nI've ever experienced,\nand it's scaring the shit out of me.\n- How often does that happen?\n- I don't have a toehold\non anything,\n- Yeah.\n- even that I exist as an entity,\nand that can be really...\nI think, frankly, experientially,\nthat's kind of the gateway to both\nthe transcendental mystical experiences,\nthe sense of unity with all things,\nwhich we know our data suggests\nis related to long-term positive outcomes.\n- Wait, I want to make sure I understand.\nSo you're saying, the\nbad trip can be related\nto the transcendental experience?\n- Right, I think those are both,\nspeculating, but you have to pass through\nthis sort of like reality shattering,\nincluding your sense of self,\nand one can handle that\nin one of two ways.\nYou can either completely surrender to it,\nor you can try to hang on,\nand if you try to hang on,\nit's going to be more like a bad trip.\nSo again, I wish there was more,\nand hopefully, there will\nbe more, experimentation.\nThere's a lot going on\nhere in the black box,\nin terms of the operant\nbehavior of how you are\nwithin yourself choosing to\nhandle letting go, you know?\nAnd eventually, we'll be\nable to see this in real time\nwith brain imaging.\nAh, there, they are surrendering\nto the psychedelic experience.\nHere, they are trying to hold on.\nBut we we're not there yet.\nBut I think through clinical observation,\nit seems pretty clear\nthat something like that is going on.\nAnd certain drugs, like DMT, smoked DMT,\ncan be so strong.\nThe reason I think that\ncan be so extraordinary,\neven compared to the others,\n'cause it forces people.\nThere is no choice\nto hang out.\n- I've never done it.\n- Yeah.\n- I was told\nthat DMT is like a high-speed locomotive\ninto the psychedelic experience,\nand out of the psychedelic experience,\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- and there's no ability\nto hold onto the self\nwhile you're in the kind of peak phase.\nIs that correct?\n- A lot of people say that.\nTerence McKenna, who's kind of the\nclassic bard on DMT effects,\nhe would say, \"The sense\nof self was intact,\nbut everything else, the\nsensorium, and what you navigated,\nwhat you oriented towards,\neverything else changed, basically\".\nBut it's hard to...\nWhen everything's changing,\nit's hard to say like,\nwhat is the self that's changing?\nWhat is the rest of the world?\n- Well, and Languages is totally deficient\nto describe experience anyway,\nmuch less on a psychedelic.\nWhat is McKenna's background?\nWhat is his qualification for being this,\nas you referred, this bard of DMT\nand psychedelics?\n- And we're talking\nabout Terrence, and there's\nalso the brother, Dennis,\nwhom I know, whose-\n- Can only imagine\nwhat Thanksgiving dinner\n- Yeah, they're brothers.\n- is like at their house.\n- Terence passed away years,\na couple decades ago now.\nBut he's sort of the one\nwho's known as being a bard,\nand you can find hundreds,\nif not thousands,\nof hours of him on the lecture circuit\nin the '80s and '90s on YouTube.\nBut his background was really...\nOh gosh, I don't recall what\nhis college degree was in.\nBut he basically, when he was 19,\nhe traveled to South America,\nand actually, on the initial\ntrip, with his brother,\nwho was even younger than him,\nwith some other friends,\nand just in search for a DMT\nsnuff that they had read about\nin the Harvard archives\nfrom the work of Schultes\nfrom a generation before.\nBut they had discovered all of these\nmushrooms growing down there,\nthe psilocybin mushrooms,\nwhat they recognized,\nand just took a lot of mushrooms,\nand-\n- And talked about it?\n- Talked about it.\nAnd Terence was basically\nvery intelligent,\nvery well-read in literature\nand culture person that could...\nHe was sort of the next\ngeneration's Tim Leary,\nsomeone who could really speak,\nget a little closer to the magnitude\nof what the psychedelic\nexperience was like for people.\nAnd he serves, like Leary,\nsomewhat of an advocate.\nI mean, he would tell people,\nfolks, you could see the\nequivalent of a UFO landing\non the White House lawn.\nLike, it's right there.\nIt'll take five minutes.\nIt'll shake everything in your reality.\nYou know, he would sort of\ngoad people into doing it.\n- Well, certainly, science\nand clinical medicine is,\nare just but two lenses\nwith which to explore\nthese things in life.\nWell, part of the reason I ask is,\nI feel like,\nin the world of health and fitness,\nyou have this very extreme condition\nof like Arnold Schwarzenegger's\nand bodybuilders\nwho have 2% body fat,\nand they look like, to most people,\nthey look kind of freakish,\n- Yeah\nespecially now, right?\n- Oh, especially now.\n- Especially now.\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- And yeah-\n- Made Arnold look\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- like regular-\n- Exactly.\n- Back in his day, yeah.\n- Yeah.\nAnd you have contortionists\nwho can put themselves into a small box\nand wrap themselves into a pretzel.\nBut from those two very extreme\nsubculture practices that,\nI don't know anything about\ncontortionism, really,\nbut except that they get really bendy,\nbut it's a community that\nincluded lifestyle practices,\nand nutritional practices,\nand then drug practices.\nFrom those very extreme subcultures,\nthere's been an export,\nwhich is that weight\ntraining is healthy, right?\nThe general public has done that.\nOr that yoga is healthy.\n- Yeah.\n- So contortionism\nto yoga, et cetera.\nAnd I feel like a similar\nthing is happening\nin the realm of psychedelics,\nwhere it was Leary and Huxley.\nLook, I'm from the Bay Area.\nI'm not far from the Midland Park VA,\nwhere \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's\" is\nbasically, based on, right?\n- Oh, yeah.\n- Ken Kesey and those guys.\nThere has been an attempt at\ncreating this movement toward\nopenness about psychedelics\nand their positive effects.\nThis has happened before.\n- Yeah.\n- The difference is,\nthat now, there are people like you\ninside the walls of the university,\nor publishing peer-reviewed studies,\nand things of that sort.\nThe reason I asked about McKenna was,\nit seems like McKenna and his brother\nare but just two of many people,\nMichael Pollan, et cetera,\nwho have no real formal training\nin biology or psychology.\nThe other guys who were at\nuniversities lost their jobs.\nThey were actually removed from places\nlike Harvard and other universities\nfor their kind of cavalier explorations.\nRight?\n- Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.\n- And now, things are kind of returning.\nSo in the same way that\nbodybuilding led to\nweight training in every corner gym,\n- Yeah.\n- men, women, and children,\nand contortionism is one extreme,\nbut people generally think that yoga\nis a pretty healthy practice, right?\nThese are matter of degrees, right?\nAnd now, here you are\n- Yeah.\n- inside the walls of a\nvery highly respected\nuniversity, Johns Hopkins.\nYou're on the medical school side,\n- Mm-hmm.\n- or the undergrad?\n- So in the med school,\n- Medical.\n- which is a serious health institution.\nThe question is to me,\nwhat are the valuable exports, right?\nAnd where does the extreme lie?\nI mean, clearly, there's a problem\nwith tinkering with reality\nthrough pharmacology,\nand there's a benefit, it sounds like,\nto tinkering with reality\nthrough pharmacology.\n- Yeah.\n- And what's so striking to me,\nis the elements of atypical experience,\natypical representation of the self.\nSo for the average person, right?\nOr for kids that are hearing this.\nKids that are in their teens, right?\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- I want to talk about, what\nare the dangers of psychedelics?\nIt's something you don't\nhear a lot about these days,\nand it's not because I'm\nanti-psychedelic at all,\nbut what are the dangers, right?\nIf a kid or adult has a\npredisposition toward, let's say,\npsychotic thinking, right?\nOr auditory hallucinations?\n- Yeah.\n- Whereas on the Asperger's\nside of the autism spectrum,\nis there an increased risk\nof bringing the mind into these states?\n'Cause it sounds like a\nvery labile situation.\nSo could we talk a little bit about that?\nAnd are there classes of\nthese different drugs,\nwhether or not it be MDMA, LSD, or DMT,\nthat you think are\nparticularly sharp blades,\nand therefore need to be\nwielded particularly carefully?\n- Yeah.\nSo these can be profoundly\nde-stabilizing experiences,\nand ones that, ideally, are\nhad in a safe container,\nsort of where someone...\nWhat are the relevant dangers,\nand what can we do to mitigate those?\nSo there's two biggies.\nOne, and I've already mentioned,\nit's people with very\nsevere psychiatric illness.\nNot depression, not anxiety.\nI'm talking about psychotic\ndisorders like schizophrenia,\nor mania as part of bipolar disorder.\nAnd diagnostically, this has shifted.\nSo it's a little hard to say\nhow many people today with bipolar\nwould have been labeled as\nschizophrenia back in the '60s\nwhen some of this early research\nor just clinical observation was done.\nSo it seems very clear\nthat folks with a predisposition\nor active disease,\nthey could be destabilized.\nAnd so some of the cases that we know of,\nI always think of Syd Barrett,\nthe first singer of Pink Floyd,\nseems pretty clear.\nAlthough, I think the family-\n- I don't know\nwhat happened there.\n- So he-\n- I should be...\nSorry, Pink Floyd fans.\nI've never...\nThe songs are just really long.\n- Yeah, you're more of a punk guy, right?\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n[both laughing]\nSo I've got my foot in a lot of worlds,\ndefinitely in part in the Floyd world.\nBut he basically went crazy early on.\nI don't think his family ever admitted it,\nbut he developed\nschizophrenia, classic pattern,\nand he was doing a lot of LSD.\nBut like a lot of these cases,\nit looked like he was\nshowing all of the signs of,\nsome hints of\nthat he had that susceptibility before.\nAnd often, this is hard to\ndisentangle what causes what,\nbecause when do people, typically,\nnot always, but develop?\nWhen's the modal period for first break?\nIt's adolescence, early adulthood.\nYeah.\nAnd when do people start\nplaying with drugs?\n[laughs] Same exact time period,\nso it can be hard to disentangle.\nBut it seems pretty clear.\nNow, I should also say,\nthere are cases of\nfolks with schizophrenia\nthat say psychedelics have helped them.\nThere's anecdotes for everything, though.\nIt's a big world.\n- Do the people around\nthose schizophrenics say it's helped them,\nor just-\n- I don't know.\n- 'Cause when schizophrenics say things,\nyou have to-\n- You have to weight it.\n- I mean, with all due compassion\nand respect for schizophrenia,\nit's a disorder of thinking.\nSo if they're saying, it helped them?\n- Yeah, can you trust them?\nYeah.\nI wouldn't be surprised\nif there was some kernel\nof truth in some cases,\nbut they're just so...\nIt seems very clear that\nthe other side is there too,\nand that if there ever is\na therapeutic potential\nthere for those disorders,\nthat that shouldn't be the\nfirst thing on our list,\nand we need to learn a lot more,\nbecause of the level of risk,\nbefore we start doing research to see if\npsilocybin can help with schizophrenia.\nI don't think...\n[Dr. Huberman mumbles]\nThat may never be the case,\nbut even if it is,\nyou'd have to be even more cautious\nand figure some more things out first\nwith some of these other disorders.\n- What about bipolar?\n- 'Cause it seems-\n- Bipolar disorder, can it be exacerbated\nby these compounds?\n- Yeah, and it's-\nIt may be that, sort of the manifestation\nof people having prolonged\npsychiatric issues\nafter a psychedelic experience,\nas atypical as that is,\nwhen that happens, it may be that\nthat might be more like a manic episode\nthan a psychotic episode,\nand that can be a blurry line.\nThe folklore is that,\npeople go on a trip, and\nthey never come back.\nThat's clearly not the case,\nbecause the drug is metabolized,\nlike for anyone else,\nand the next day,\nthere's virtually nothing-\n- But it reshapes circuitry.\nI mean-\n- Right.\nAnd I really do think,\nmuch like the positive long-term effects\nthat this class of problems is related to,\nthe experience and the destabilization\nthat can happen from that experience,\nif it's not in the right container.\nAnd again, these people\nare susceptible to...\nYou know, some people with\nthat psychotic predisposition,\nthey lucky to be born to a great family,\na stable environment.\nThey maybe never have a full break,\nor the one that they\nhave is not nearly as bad\nas what someone who's homeless,\nand is coming from all kinds\nof early childhood trauma.\nThe disease is probably\ngoing to be far worse.\nHaving a psychedelic experience\nis like one of those\nde-stabilizing experiences.\nNow, fortunately, it's really\neasy to identify those people.\nAnd we even err on the\nside of extreme caution\nby eliminating people with like, say,\na first degree relative.\nIn some studies, even a\nsecond degree relative.\nGiven the heritability,\nthere's some increased chance\n- Sure.\n- if your brother or your...\nYeah.\nSo in an abundance of caution,\neven eliminating that...\nI think, eventually, if it's\napproved for use, FDA use,\nwe could dial back on\nthat as we learn more.\nI think, it's, again, overly cautious,\nwhich is-\n- But you're doing\nan early stage\nclinical trial, so.\n- Yeah, it's the appropriate\nplace to start at this point in time.\nBut if you give a SCID,\nor another structured\npsychiatric interview with a clinician,\nsitting down with this\nperson for a few hours\nto delve into their history,\nlike you could very reliably determine\nthat this person has either\na psychotic disorder,\nor bipolar disorder, or\na strong predisposition.\nYou can screen for that,\nand that's how you address that.\nThe far more likely\ndanger is the bad trip.\nAnyone can have this.\nThe most psychologically\nhealthy person in the world, probably.\nYou jack the dose high enough,\nand especially in a less\nthan an ideal environment,\nyou can have a bad trip.\nYou even get it in an\nideal environment like ours\nat a high dose of around 30\nmilligrams of psilocybin.\nAfter the best preparation we can provide,\nabout a third of people\nwill say, essentially,\nat some point, they have a bad trip,\nand we'd-\n- At some point\nwithin the entire journey.\n- Right.\n- Yeah.\n- Now, they could have\none of the most beautiful\nexperiences of their life, sometimes,\nlike a couple of minutes later.\n- Right.\n- But at some point,\nthey had a sense of strong anxiety, fear,\nlosing their mind, feeling\ntrapped, something like that.\nNow, typically, when people have that,\nwhen they're just taken on their own,\nlike a lot of things, they're fine.\nThey get through it.\nThey're more likely to be better off\nif they're not having to navigate\nthe streets of Manhattan.\nAnd if they're with other\npeople, with friends,\nbetter that those friends aren't\nalso dealing with their\nown psychedelic experience.\nBut probably having\nsome friend of any type,\n[mumbles] is better than having nothing.\nSo very dependent on context.\nAnd so the tough thing here\nthat in conveying to the public is that,\na lot of folks will say,\nman, I've taken psychedelics\nhundreds of times,\nand this is like you're fear-mongering,\nand there's no,\nyou're exaggerating the danger there.\nSo I want to say, it is atypical,\nbut sometimes, and I have a file folder\nthat grows larger every\nyear of these cases,\neither in the medical\nliterature or from the news,\nof people that freak out on a psychedelic,\nand they get hurt or they die.\nThey run into traffic.\nThey fall from a height.\nWhether they thought they could fly,\nor whether they just fell,\nlike you can do when you're drunk\nor you're intoxicated on any substance.\nSometimes that's unclear.\nOr gosh, one of the\ncraziest cases was a kid,\nlike an 18-year-old or so, in Oregon,\nseveral years back, that just...\nHe even wrote about, I\nwant to take the biggest...\nHe had done mushrooms before.\nI want to take a heroic dose.\nThe biggest dose I've ever taken.\nHe ended up just totally out of it.\nEnded up in a neighbor's house.\nHe was just totally disoriented,\ndisconnected from reality,\nand the cops and ended up killing him,\nand it was just tragic.\nObviously, an overuse\nof force in that case,\n'cause he was actually naked at the time.\nThis naked like 120 pounds,\nI think, as I recall, kid\nthat ended up dying.\nBut-\n- Well, it's analogous\nto the reason I used the\nexamples of bodybuilding culture.\nI mean, people there have taken\nexcessive amounts of anabolic\nand diuretics, and died.\nThen the contortionist culture,\npeople would put themselves\nin the little plexiglass boxes to do...\nAt the extremes,\nyou're going to get deaths,\nand at the extremes\n- Right.\n- and one of the extremes is\nthe sheer number of people\nwith different biological\nmakeups taking the same drug.\nAnd so you can create\nextremes through numbers.\nYou'd create extremes\nthrough dosage, right?\nIt seems.\n- Right.\n- Well, this is why I'm\nsuch a fan of the fact\nthat people like yourself\nare doing clinical trials\ninside the walls of universities.\nNot because I think that psychedelics\nonly have utility in those environments,\nbut because it's so important\ntoward creating their\ntransition to legality,\nand to understand what legality means\nfor a compound like this,\nright?\n- Right.\nWhat model.\nYeah.\n- Right, I mean,\nagain, we'll stay with\nthe anabolic steroids.\nThere's now testosterone and\nestrogen replacement therapy.\nHormone replacement therapy is a common\nmedically approved practice,\nbut that's vastly different\nthan people taking their own stuff,\nor deciding how much\nthey need to take, right?\nLike we said, there's yoga,\nand there's contortionism\nin a plexiglass box,\nand thinking of Houdini,\n- Right.\n- or something.\nThese are a matter of degrees.\nSpeaking of dosage, I\ndefinitely want to ask you\nabout microdose versus\nstandard or macrodose.\nTell me that I'm wrong,\nbut I'm always a little bit,\nI'm micro-cynical, if you will,\nabout this term microdose.\nAnd the reason is,\nthat many people that I know\nwho talk about microdosing\nare taking dosages of compounds that work\nthat are very powerful\nat microgram levels.\nSo the word micro, I think,\ncan be a little bit confusing to people,\nbecause microdose implies\nless than something.\n- Yeah.\n- It's a mini dose, right?\nAnd yet, some of these compounds\nare tremendously powerful\nat microgram concentrations.\nSo what constitutes a microdose,\nand what is the value of\nso-called microdosing, if any,\nand how does it differ from standard,\nor what I can only assume\nis called macrodosing?\n- Yeah.\nAnd so LSD would be the\nprototypical example\nof that super potent compound.\n- Yeah, how much am I-\nWhat size dosage of LSD\nwill lead to hallucinations,\nand kind of standard-\n- So sort of the\nentry point for psychedelic-type effects,\nwhich may not involve hallucination...\nActually, most classic psychedelics\ndon't lead to true hallucinations,\nas defined in psychiatry.\nAgain, thinking you're talking to\nthe person that's not there,\nseeing the pink elephant.\nBut pseudo hallucinations-\n- It's more like tracers\nand things like that.\n- Right.\n- Perceptual blending.\n- Yet, some people\nnever get that, even at a very high dose.\nSo I think more broadly,\nin terms of the psychedelic effects,\nwhich isn't just perceptual,\nunless we get into the level,\nof as you were alluding to earlier,\na broader definition of perception,\nlike one's models of the\nworld, the model of the self.\nYou can consider all of that perception,\nin terms of truly not sensation,\nbut the perception,\nthe construction of\nputting together a reality.\nSo yeah, yeah, yeah.\nSo the psychedelic effects\nare typically considered\nto start by LSD around 100 micrograms.\nSo a 10th of a milligram\nis 100 micrograms.\n- Right.\nSo someone taking 100 micrograms of LSD,\nnowadays, people might\nmistakenly refer to that\nas a microdose, because it's micrograms,\nbut that's actually a macrodose of LSD?\n- Right, they might,\nand that's one of the most common mistakes\nor situations that people\nget into with microdosing,\nis they intend it to be a microdose,\nbut it ends up being a full-blown dose.\nNow, people do, when\nthey're working with LSD,\nand they're microdosing,\nthey'll shoot for something\nlike, say, 10 milligrams,\nsomething in that range,\n10, 20 milligrams of LSD.\nSo a 10th, a 5th,\nsomething of kind of your\nentry level psychedelic dose.\nPeople's ability on the street to do this,\nand I say the street as\nif they're on the corner,\nbut anyway, like outside of the\nmedical profession to do this,\nit varies, as you can imagine.\n- And they're not measuring\npurity and molarity,\n- Yeah.\n- or things like that, typically.\n- And there's ways to do it.\nSo even if you don't\nultimately know the dose\nthat's in the blotter paper of acid,\none could at least get a sense of like,\nyeah, having one of those tabs is,\none of those hits is a\npsychedelic experience.\nAnd they could do something\nlike put in water.\nIt's 100% aqueous soluble.\nYou could make sure it\nall gets into solution,\nand then volumetrically measure.\nIt's going to be\nhomogeneously distributed,\nso you can you take 1/10\nof that volume of water\nafter it's fully dissolved,\nthat whatever you started with,\nyou're going to have a 10th of that dose.\nSo the people that are more sophisticated\nwill do things like that.\nAnd when they're working with mushrooms,\nthey'll grow a bunch of mushrooms,\nand then they'll say, put\nit in a coffee grinder.\nI'm not telling people\nto do this, by the way.\nI'm just describing.\nSo don't do this at home.\nBut grind it all up so it's homogenous.\n'Cause you can have like\nsort of taking two caps and a stem,\nhey, this two caps and the\nstem that this buddy takes\nhas a different potency than\nthis two caps and a stem\nthat the other buddy takes.\nSo people that are kind of in the know\nwill grind it all up\ninto a homogenous powder,\nand they'll pack it into\nwhatever size capsule,\nand they'll know that...\nAnd again, even if they don't have...\nSometimes, they might have a buddy\nthat'll sneak it into the\nHPLC at their job or whatever,\nif they happen\nto be well connected.\n- Not your lab-\n- Not my lab!\nThat's never happened.\nSeriously, it never happened.\nBut they'll at least know that,\nhey, I've got a sense\nof what two capsules do.\nI've got a sense of what five capsules do.\nBut in reality,\nthat's not what people do.\nThey'll take a piece of blotter paper,\nand they get a tiny,\nlittle pair of scissors,\na Swiss Army Knife pair of scissors,\nand they'll cut up the tab of acid,\nwhich is like a quarter\ninch square or something,\nand they'll cut it up in 10 little pieces,\nand it's like,\n- Right.\n- you have no idea\nif it's equally distributed in that media.\n- Yeah, and we can chuckle about it.\nBut to me, one of the reasons why\nthis experiment around psychedelics,\nthis cultural experiment,\nand this legal experiment,\nwe're seeing this now,\nbut this was all attempted once\nbefore in the '60s and '70s.\nThe difference was,\nit was all out in the street.\nThe people in universities who were\ndabbling with this stuff,\nmost of 'em lost their jobs,\nor were asked to leave through...\n- They lost their funding\nfor this research,\nminimally,\n[interposing voices]\n- That's right.\n- and they had to\nmove on to other topics\n- That's right.\n- to have a career.\n- So these are\nprecarious times.\nWe're at a key moment,\nwhere everyone assumes that\nthis is all going to be legal\nin a few years.\nbut I think that that's\na premature assumption,\nfrankly.\n- Yeah.\n- Let's touch on the legality,\nand some of the things\nthat are happening now.\nBut what is microdosing psilocybin\nversus the sorts of dosages\nthat you described before\nin the 10 to 40 milligram range?\nI've heard of people taking\none or two milligrams\nof psilocybin every day\nas a way to, quote/unquote,\nand for those listening,\nI'm just making air\nquotes with my fingers,\n\"increase plasticity\",\nwhich is a term that I personally loathe,\nbecause what does that mean?\nI mean, you don't really want\nyour brain to be plastic,\nbecause you need to maintain your ability\nto make predictions.\n- It's that balance.\n- Yeah, plasticity-\n- Order in chaos.\nYou need models of the world.\nYou need heuristics, like-\n- Plasticity is\nnever the goal,\nor be it, plasticity is never the goal.\n- The end goal.\n- Goal directed plasticity\nis the goal, right?\n- Right.\nRight.\n- Learning a language,\nreshaping your experience to a trauma,\naltering the perception of self.\nBut plasticity is a process.\nIt's a-\n- Yeah,\nschizophrenia is a lot of plasticity.\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\n- Exactly.\nRight, right.\nAnd it might even be,\nthere's one theory that it's\nextreme ongoing plasticity,\nand that's why people never create\nstable representations of anything.\nThat's kind of a minority view out there.\nSo what's the business with microdosing,\nand is there any clinical evidence,\nor peer-reviewed published\nevidence that it works,\nquote/unquote, \"to make people\nfeel better about anything\"?\n- So microdosing is the aim\nof taking against something\naround a 10th of what would be\nsort of an entry-level psychedelic dose\nfor whatever compound.\nSo like, yeah, with psilocybin,\nusually people, almost\nnever do people have\nlike pure psilocybin.\nOne milligram of psilocybin\nwould be in the range of a microdose.\nMore likely, people are\ngoing to have mushrooms,\nso something like a half\nof a gram of mushroom,\na quarter gram.\n- I know people that\nare doing this every day.\nThey're doing these every day.\n- Right.\n- It's like in their...\nThe same way that I take,\npersonally, I'm not recommending\nother people do this,\nbut I take some...\nI'm a fan of LCL-carnitine lately.\nI've been kind of\n- Yeah.\n- experimenting with that\na little bit, which is not\na psychedelic compound.\nI take it every day,\n- Right.\n- and they're taking their\npsilocybin every day.\n- That's their supplement.\n- That's their supplement.\n- Yeah.\n- So-\n- So yeah,\nthe claims are, and\nthey're a number of them,\nthere's two general ones.\nOne, is sort of acting in place\nof the ADHD treating drugs.\nSo the psychomotor stimulant,\nso like a better version of Adderall.\nThe other claims are, essentially,\na better version of the\ntraditional antidepressants,\na better version of Prozac,\nyou know, so-\n- So people are taking both\nfor attention deficit and for depression?\n- Yeah, and the aspects\nof those disorders that\nwe all have a degree of.\nJust like amphetamine is\ngoing to increase the focus,\nat the right dose, of anyone\nwho takes amphetamine, pretty much,\nwhether you're ADHD diagnosed or not.\nThe idea is that,\nthere may not be,\nnecessarily, a clear divide\nbetween the therapeutic need\nand positive psychology,\neven improving mood and focus,\nso it's not necessarily correcting ADHD,\nbut improving focus to\nsupercharge your life.\nAnd so those are the claims.\nI am...\nSo none of the peer-reviewed\nstudies that are,\nhave much credibility,\nnone of them have shown a benefit,\nand they've tried.\nThere's only, at this point,\nfour or five studies that...\nAnd I think for things like this,\nyou really need double blind research,\n'cause the effects...\nI mean, there was one\nstudy done in Amsterdam\nwhere people knew they were\ntaking psilocybin truffles,\nbasically same as mushrooms,\nThey're more like the\nroots of the mycelia.\n- Microdosing them?\n- Well, taking what would\nbe considered a microdose,\nand then doing some cognitive\nmeasures before and after.\nAnd the types of things that,\nlike a lot of cognitive\nmeasures are measured on,\nthe order of reaction\ntime in milliseconds.\nAnd the types of effects you get,\nas you could imagine,\nare ones that like would be,\nyou would totally expect could be there\nfrom either a practice effect\nor an expectancy effect, a placebo effect.\nSo for something like these claimed,\nyou could imagine, a sort\nof an increased focus,\nenhancement of cognition.\nThese are going to be more subtle effects\nthat you really need a\ngood placebo control for.\nThe handful of studies that\nhave done that have shown,\nthey've ranged from finding\nno effect whatsoever\nto just a little bit of impairment,\nlike impairing someone's\nability to do time estimation\nand production tasks.\nSo you want an accurate sense of time,\nat least if you're\nnavigating in the real world.\nIt's different if you're on\nthe couch on a heroic dose\nfor therapeutic reasons where you're safe,\nbut if you're crossing\nthe street, if you're...\nIn your work life-\n- You have to\nfunction in the world.\n- Yeah, which is the way people\nare claiming to use that.\nIt helps them be a better CEO.\nYou want an accurate sense of time.\nSo if anything in the data suggests\nthat it makes it a\nlittle bit less accurate,\nand there's evidence that someone feels\na little bit impaired,\nand they feel a little bit high.\nSo in terms of...\nYou call that abuse liability in research.\nNot surprising, you take\na little bit of a drug\nthat can result in some type of a high,\nand you take a little, tiny bit of it,\nyou'll feel a little bit high.\nSo none of the...\nSo far, no studies have shown\nan increase in creativity,\nenhancement of any form of cognition,\nor a sustained improvement in mood.\nNow, no studies have actually looked at\nthe system of microdosing that\nthe aficionados are claiming,\nand there's a couple of models out there.\nBut folks like Paul Stamets, and others,\nthey'll have particular formulas.\nThey're like, you need to take it one day,\nand then take so many days off,\nand take it every four days.\nAnd I don't want to get\ninto whose model is what,\nbut it's always something like that,\nsome pattern of use,\nusually not every day.\nAnd the claim is that, it's not just...\nYou know, sometimes people get benefit\nthat first time when they take it,\nbut they really say, you\nneed to be on it for a while.\nLike a few weeks in,\nyou may start to notice\nthrough this pattern of using it,\nand you're feeling the\nbenefits on those off days,\nlike the three or two days\nin between your active doses.\nSo those are the claims.\nAgain, we don't know that there's\nany truth to that working,\nbut studies have not\nbeen done to model that.\nSo that's a big caveat.\nWe, as a field,\nI say, \"we\", as the scientific field,\nhave not done the studies to really model\nwhat the real aficionados are claiming\nwhere the therapeutic benefits come from.\nThat said, it's almost assuredly\nthere's a good amount of placebo there.\nBut the caveat to that is like,\nalmost everything in\nmedicine or therapeutics,\nit's going to have some degree\nof placebo there.\n- Sure.\nBelief effects are...\nI have a colleague at Stanford, Alia Crum,\nwho has published really\nbeautiful work on belief effects,\nthat show that, essentially,\nyou give the same milkshake to two people,\nor two groups of people.\nYou tell them that one\ncontains a lot of nutrients.\nThe other is a low calorie shake.\nThe insulin response\n- Amazing.\nYeah.\n- varies dramatically\nbetween the two.\nOr two groups, rather,\ndoing equivalent amounts\nof physical movement,\nand you tell one group that\nit's going to be good for them,\nand help them lose weight,\nand they lose, on average,\n8 to 12 pounds more\ndoing the exact same\npatterns of movement.\n- Amazing.\n- And I think that these\nbelief effects boil down to\nall sorts of kind of\nnetwork-wide neuromodulation,\nthings of that sort, but-\n- And then the\nwork at Harvard suggesting,\nthat even if you don't have deception,\nyou give a placebo, and say,\nthis is a sugar pill,\n- Right.\n- and tell them that,\n- Right.\n- and they could still treat things.\nI think irritable bowel\n- Right.\n- was the first thing they looked at.\n- Right.\n- And so there's a huge...\nso there's a reality there.\n- Right.\n- There's a necessity in developing drugs\nto make sure it's not only that.\nBut in the actual practice of medicine,\nhopefully, what you're always getting\nis some underlying direct efficacy\nplus the placebo\nthat enhances that.\n- Right.\n- Now, it could be that this is...\nThe real question is,\nis the microdosing,\nare those claims 100% placebo,\nor are they only part placebo,\nand part \"real\", quote/unquote, effect?\nMy bet is, and this is\ntotally based on anecdotes,\nthat I think there is probably a reality\nto the antidepressant effects.\nI find that more intriguing,\n- Well-\n- because of the\nsuffering with depression.\n- Right.\n- Even if it's a...\nIt wouldn't be as interesting as, I think,\nwhat we're doing with high dose psilocybin\nor psychedelics to treat depression.\nIt would be...\nIf this is developed,\nand there's a reality,\nit would be more like a better,\nperhaps, a better SSRI, a better Prozac.\n- Which are similar.\n- With that being said,\nwe need more tools than\nfewer tools in the toolbox.\n- Right.\n- And it shouldn't be\nthat surprise.\nLike even before,\ngoing back to the tricyclics,\nand the MAO inhibitors,\ngoing back to the '50s,\nlike augmenting extracellular serotonin\nin one way or another,\nfor many people,\nleads to a reduction\nin depressive symptoms.\nIt wouldn't be that crazy\nfor chronically stimulating a\nsubtype of serotonin receptor\nthat you have an antidepressant effect.\nSo I think, if I had to put my bets on it,\nif there's anything real,\nit is in that category.\nAlthough, I'm very open to like,\nmaybe there is something\nto the creativity,\nto the improved cognition,\nwhich covers many\ndomains in and of itself.\nBut my greatest hopes are on\nthe antidepressant effects.\nThat said, in the big picture,\nI think the most interesting\nthing about psychedelics\nare the heroic doses.\nI mean, the idea that you can\ngive something one, two, three times,\nand you see improvements\nin depression months later,\n- Right.\n- and in addiction\nover a year later,\nand with these, people dealing with\npotentially terminal illness,\nI mean, I'm interested in big effects.\n- [Dr. Huberman] Right.\n- And I don't think\nyou're ever going to get\nthe really big effects.\nThere's also some concern\nthat almost all of these common psych,\nthe more common psychedelics,\neven counting MDMA,\nthey have serotonin to be agonist effects,\nand agonizing serotonin 2B\nhas been shown to lead to\nheart valve formation problems,\nmorphology issues, so valvulopathy.\nAnd so this is why fen-phen\nwas pulled from the market.\n- The diet drug?\n- Yes.\n- A very effective diet drug.\n- Right, right.\nAnd it was the portion of that combination\nthat had the serotonin 2B\nactivity that was the problem.\nAnd so we don't know...\nSo all of the toxicologists\nI've ever spoken to about this would say,\nand cardiologists say, like,\nlook, hey, if there\nwas some concern there,\nit's not applicable to the whole idea\nof you taking something a few times\ntherapeutically within a lifetime.\nBut the idea of taking something\ntwice a week for years...\nI mean, even the hippies back in the '60s\nweren't doing that, right?\nThere's not even these...\nAnd even if there was some\nheart valve disease problem\nthat stemmed from psychedelic use,\nwho's connecting those dots?\nThat's not showing up\nin the clinical charts\nfor anyone to figure out.\nAnd just theoretically,\nthere is more of a concern,\nif something's going to\nhappen with heart valves,\nit's more likely that\nthat issues would arise\nwhen someone's taking these things,\nlike, yeah, say, twice a\nweek for the next five years.\nAnd so I do want to throw that out\nto people to really consider.\n- Right, yeah.\nIt's something I hadn't heard before.\nThat in micro sounds safer, microdosing,\nas opposed to heroic or macrodosing,\nand yet, unless...\nAnd in the context of your lab,\nand other labs doing similar work,\nyou've got this,\npeople checking blood pressure.\nYou've got people that\nare really monitoring\nyour psychological and physical safety.\nWhen people are out there microdosing,\nit sounds like there's the potential,\neither through this\nserotonin 5H2B receptor,\nor other mechanism,\nthat maybe there could be some common\ncumulative negative effects,\nand I think that's a really\nimportant consideration.\nSo I'm glad you brought it up.\nWhat about kids?\nSo the brain is very\nplastic early in life.\nIt becomes less plastic as we age.\n- Yeah.\n- Although,\nit maintains some degree of plasticity\nthroughout the lifespan.\nThe year 25,\nnot the year 25,\nbut rather, the age 25 years,\nis sort of an inflection point\nwhere the rigidity of the nervous system\nseems to really take off.\nOf course, people don't wake up\non their 25th birthday,\nand find they have no neural plasticity,\nwhereas the day before, they had a lot.\nIt's plus or minus,\n- Yeah.\n- whatever it is,\na year or two,\nbut depends on the individual.\nHowever, the young brain is very plastic,\nand I could imagine, there\ncould be great risks,\nwho knows, maybe even benefits,\nbut I'm certainly not\nthinking about those.\nI'm mainly thinking about the risks\nfor young people taking psychedelics.\nAre there any trials looking at people...\nIn clinical trials,\nthis would be under the age of 18,\nHas anyone explored\nthis in a rigorous way,\ngiven the potential to\nexacerbate psychotic symptoms\nand bipolar symptoms in some people?\nIs there a heightened risk of that?\nWhat's the story with age of use\nand psychedelics for therapeutic purposes?\n- There's no formal research.\nAlthough, there's a very high\nchance that there will be.\nAnd so this is one of the\nvery interesting things\nfolks may not realize\nor appreciate about the\nFDA approval process.\nSo the FDA already, in multiple instances,\nhas signaled that they\nwant to see those studies.\n- Before?\n- Well, not before it's approved\nas necessarily as for adults,\nbut they're going to\neventually want to see...\nIn fact, so the MAPS group\nthat's developing MDMA for PTSD,\nthey've already signaled\nthat that's kind of\non the list of interest.\nAnd there's even some\nincentives in the FDA pathways\nfor incentivizing folks to\nexplore that use in young people.\nI know in some of the\nwork that I helped with\nin pushing psilocybin into\nphase 2B clinical research,\nthe FDA said, \"Well why\ncan't you give this to kids?\"\nIt's like, are you aware that depression\nis a problem with adolescents?\nAnd it's really interesting,\nbecause this FDA is very concerned\nabout pseudo-specificity.\nThe idea that-\n- Wait, could you define\npseudo-specificity?\n- You put out a drug,\nand say, oh, this is good\nfor men, but not women.\nThis is good for black\nfolks, but not white folks.\nAnd now, sometimes, there's a\nvery good rationale for that,\nlike when we're talking about hormones,\nand for a specific,\nfor men versus women,\nand there's certain issues,\ncertain disease states,\nlike maybe sickle cell anemia,\nthat's more relevant.\n- Or Tay-Sachs,\nthings like that.\nSure.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nBut absent of something of that,\nthey're very concerned about saying,\noh, this is for this type of person,\nbut not that type of person.\nSo age is one of those things.\nAnd also, this recognition,\nmuch like the emphasis at NIH\nwith rodent studies and human studies,\nthat you can't just say,\n\"You're studying men\".\nYou need a rationale,\nif you're only [mumbles].\n- Yeah, to be clear to people, there's...\nIt's a recent switch,\nbut there's a stipulation in\nevery federally funded grant\nthat both sexes,\nwe don't refer to gender\nin scientific studies,\nunless it's a study of gender, per se.\nWe refer to sex, meaning biological sex,\nso that there's a stipulation,\nthat in order to receive and\ncontinue to receive funding,\nyou have to do a studies on both males\nand females of that\nspecies, including humans.\n- And at least, even if\nyou're not powered for it,\nat least looking at that\nin exploratory analysis.\nLike as a grant reviewer,\nI'm charged with looking at,\ndid they address sex as a biologically\nrelevant variable anyway?\n- Right.\nDoes the same-\n- You just throw it in there-\n- Does the same drug\nhave different effects\nin males versus females?\n- Right.\nAnd you could at least look\nat the trends, even again,\nif you're underpowered to look at those\nbetween subject-type effects.\n- Which is a great shift that didn't exist\n10 years ago.\n- Right.\n- It sounds like we're\nboth on grants panels.\nAs study section members,\nyou didn't have to do that.\nNow, it's an important\nbiological variable.\nIf you don't look at that,\nyou, essentially, won't get your funding.\n- And age is a similar thing.\nSo if the whole idea, like,\nman, if something could help kids,\nwhat's the rationale?\nSo I think there's going to be...\nNow, obviously, you're going\nto have in those studies\nat least just as much, probably more,\nit should be more, of\na cautionary approach.\nIt's probably going to be...\nIt would certainly,\nwhatever disease states are looked at,\nare going to to have to be\nprobably treatment resistant,\nat least as a first step.\nYou know, hey,\nthe kids tried-\n- Suicidal depression?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nAnd so all of that in the mix.\nBut hey, if this stuff really helps people\nthat are 25 or 30,\nwhat's the rationale that it\nwon't help a younger person?\nAnd there's these generic\nkind of concerns about,\nthe developing nervous system,\nis more susceptible to...\nI mean, it cuts both ways,\n'cause it's also more\n\"plastic\" generally\n- Yeah.\n- and adaptable, maybe resilient\nto injury in certain ways.\nBut you hear the rhetoric about kids,\ntheir brains, and drugs,\nand it's like the developing\nbrain is a special concern.\nSo yeah.\nBut I think we're going to be\nseeing research eventually.\n- That's interesting.\nI went to the high school\nthat is infamous, sadly,\nGunn High School, for\nhaving the highest degree,\nat least at one point,\nof highest suicide rate.\n- Wow.\n- A very large number of suicides.\nThis was written up in\nthe \"Times\" and elsewhere.\n- Is it very academically\nsuccessful school?\n- It's a very academically-\n- There's a lot of\nhigh pressure kind of-\n- Yeah, a very academically\n- demanding school,\n- Yeah.\n- to the point where they've restricted...\nThe kids will meet often at 6:30 AM\nor 6:00 AM before school for study groups\nand things of that sort.\nSo some of it may relate to that.\nBut I have to say,\nthat even prior to all\nthat academic pressure,\nwhen I went there,\nthe pressure wasn't like that.\nWe had an unusual number of\nsuicides for whatever reason,\nand so the idea of kids being prescribed,\nand I want to emphasize prescribed,\nnot just using,\nbut prescribed psychedelics\nfor therapeutic purposes,\nI think might make some people balk,\nbut the idea of kids killing themselves\nshould also make people balk.\nAnd so I'm relieved to hear\nthat there's going to be\na rational, scientific,\nsafe clinical trial-based\nexploration of this.\nI want to ask you about the current status\nof these drugs and compounds.\nI'm pretty active on social media,\nmore so on Instagram than on Twitter.\nBut as I have been on Twitter\na little bit more recently,\nI've noticed that\nthere's a lot of dialogue\naround your account and\nother people's accounts\naround a couple of themes\nrelated to psychedelics.\nFirst of all, what is the\nstatus of the transition\nto legality for prescription purposes?\nSo medical doctors, MDs,\nprescribing it legally\nfor therapeutic purposes.\nThat's the first question.\nThe second question is,\nwhat is the status\nas it relates to possession\nand criminal charges?\nSo for a long time, I lived in Oakland,\nwhere we were one day\ntold not too long ago,\nit is now, quote/unquote,\n\"decriminalized\" is what I was told.\nDouble check, people.\n- That's right.\n- But what does that mean?\nAnd then the other issue,\nand the third question,\nand we can parse these one by one,\nis this issue of,\nlet's just say, I'm aware\nof a lot of investor dollars\ngoing into companies\nthat are, essentially,\ncompanies focused on\npsychedelics as therapeutics,\nor psychedelics generally.\nI have to assume that they are investing\nin anticipation of a\nshift in the legal status.\nAnd there's a lot of interest now,\nlike will psilocybin\nbecome a taxable thing,\njust like marijuana?\nSo let's start with the question of like,\nwhat is going on in the US legally?\nIs it illegal to possess, and\nsell, and use these compounds?\nMy understanding is,\nyou can still go to jail\nfor having these compounds\nin your possession,\nor for selling.\n- Right.\nSo even though the legal landscape\nis very different than with cannabis,\nthere are some similarities.\nSo one of the similarities is,\nthat regardless of what local, municipal,\nwhether the city or\nstate is decriminalized,\nand that word itself can mean many things.\nSome forms of\ndecriminalization is close to\nwhat folks would call legalization,\nand others are pretty weak, just saying.\nWe suggest that the police\nmake it their lowest law\nenforcement priority,\nthat type thing.\n[interposing voices]\n- Turn the other cheek\nkind of thing.\n- Right.\nBut even the cops can\nstill choose to-\n- But someone could get\npulled over for one thing, searched,\nand then by definition, if\nit's illegal, and they find it,\n- Right.\n- then they have-\n- So those are-\n- They have to do\nsomething about it.\n- And that'll probably be determined by\nboth judicial precedent,\nis it going to be thrown out,\nand just the local prosecutor,\neven before, are they going to choose,\neven at post-arrest,\nare going to pursue to really\ngo after those charges,\nmake those charges stick?\nSo I think that's still in play,\nand is going to depend\non the municipality.\nBut like cannabis,\nfederally, these are all\nSchedule I compounds.\n- Which means they're illegal?\n- Which means they're illegal.\nThe caveat to that,\njust has always been the case\nsince Prop 215 in California\nwith cannabis in '96,\nis that, hey, 99% of drug enforcement\nis done at the local and state level.\nThe DEA, which is the federal\nlevel of law enforcement,\nis a tiny fraction of the arrests.\nI mean, most people that\nare arrested for any drug\nare done by local or\nstate level authorities,\nbut it's still technically illegal.\nAnd so you can,\nand they could potentially,\ndepending on the ambiguity\nof the local law,\neven those local\nofficials could charge you\nwith a federal crime.\nAnd theoretically, the\nfeds could always come in.\nNow, although you'll...\nAgain, a similar case with\nthe whole cannabis history.\nThe feds came in in the early days,\nbut the folks that were,\nbasically, highly visible,\nthey went after Tommy\nChong for selling bongs.\nI remember him being on\n\"The Tonight Show\" one time,\nand I think it was back\nin the Jay Leno days.\nHe says, \"But all along\nthe Santa Monica boardwalk\nevery shop sells bongs\".\n\"How did you go to prison\nfor a half year for bongs?\"\nIt's cause he was...\n- 'Cause he was famous.\n- 'Cause he was Tommy Chong,\nand there was some high\nprofile cannabis groups\nthat were distributing it,\nand that were very vocal.\nThose were the ones raided\nby the DEA in the early days,\nnot the ones kind of\nkeeping to themselves,\nkeeping it quiet, and\njust doing their thing.\nSo there's always the potential\nfor selective enforcement.\nAnd so in like this initiative in Oregon,\nwhich is a state level\nlegalization of psilocybin therapy,\nwhich is really interesting,\npart of their plan for two years,\nis to figure out how to\nintegrate with the federal level.\nAnd I don't know how that's going to go,\nbecause unless you rewrite\nthe Controlled Substances Act,\nit seems like the best you're going to get\nis a tolerance from\nthe federal government,\nand that could be very,\nhey, you change administrations-\n- And this is psilocybin by a prescription\nfrom a medical doctor,\nor you're talking about therapists\nwho have master's degrees, or PhDs,\nor self-appointed coaches,\nor something like that\nadministering psilocybin,\nbut without any oversight?\n- So this is all getting\nfigured out in the Oregon case.\nAnd again, there's that\ntwo year period of like,\nbasically, we're going to figure this out,\nand so-\n- What is it with Oregon?\n- [laughs] They're ahead of a lot of...\nYou know, euthanasia.\n- I love the state of Oregon.\n- Yeah.\n- But it's interesting how\nyou have these pockets.\nOregon and Vermont seems to be one.\nYou know, you've got these kind of pockets\nwhere people are experimental\nwith plant compounds.\nThey seem to be green, woodsy areas,\nat least in my mind.\nBut there's sort of a culture\n- Yeah.\n- around plants and the use\nof plants as therapeutics.\n- And combine that with the\nWest, just more geographically,\nof more of the anti-federalism,\nI mean, the Oregon ranchers\nfrom several years ago\nthat held up the whatever, wildlife place,\nand that was a big showdown with the feds,\njust kind of the West is kind of known for\nmore of those issues.\nSo you combine the two,\nthe hippy-dippy California/Oregon vibe\nwith the kind of anti-\n- Although, I would argue\nit's becoming less hippy-dippy than...\nAlthough, it was.\nThere's always been a tradition,\nnot just in the culture around drugs,\nbut certainly, in academia,\nand in tech, et cetera,\nthat the West has been a place\nwhere people have tried to\nthrow off traditionalism,\nand kind of lineage like\nwho your parents are,\nwhat school you went to,\nand the past as a\ndeterminant of what's next\nand exciting about the future.\nAnd here we are,\nan East Coast institution guy\nand a West Coast institution guy.\nI think that it's this idea\nof kind of innovation\nand the future versus\ndo we stay grounded in\nhistory and tradition?\n- Right.\n- And, of course,\nthere are great\ninstitutions on both sides.\nWhat's interesting, is that Hopkins,\nJohns Hopkins Medical School,\nI think of as a real like East\nCoast academic institution.\nIt is on the East Coast.\nBut here you are doing\nthese very pioneering,\nand important, and\nexploratory studies in a,\ncertainly not a hippy-dippy environment.\n- Right.\nOh, yeah, a very conservative\n[interposing voices]\npsychiatry department,\n- Yeah.\n- even amongst psychiatry departments.\n- Right.\n- And as a psychologist\nin a psychiatry department,\npsychiatry is certainly more\nconservative than psychology,\neven within academics.\nBut even amongst psychiatry departments,\nit's very conservative department.\n- So we got the law at the federal level,\nwe've got the law at the\nstate and local level,\nand then we've got this question of\nwhether or not it's\ngoing to be physicians,\nso MDs, people with\nPhDs or masters degrees,\nor whether or not it will\nbe kind of a free for all\n- Right.\n- for consumption-\n- The life coaches.\n- The life coaches,\nand the general public.\n- Right.\n- I mean, cannabis-\n- Yeah.\n- I'm not a pot smoker.\nIt's never appealed to me.\nThat's just me and my pharmacology.\nBut you can buy cannabis\nmost places in the US\nwithout a ton of risk,\nit seems, right?\n- Right.\n- Are we going to see a time in which\nyou can essentially go into a shop on a\nAbbot Kinney Boulevard\nin Venice, California?\nAnd right now, you can go buy marijuana\nif you have a marijuana card.\nThat's my understanding.\nI see a lot of people going\nin and out of these stores.\nThe police, certainly,\nhave no problem with it.\nIs there going to come a time\nwhere people can just go by psilocybin?\nDo you think-\n- Like they do in Amsterdam,\nand have for a long time-\n- Do you think\nthat time is coming?\n- I think so, at a certain point,\nand I don't know how long.\nIt's hard to imagine\nour current level of drug\ncriminalization holding up for...\nAnd I'm thinking like large spans of time.\nLike, really, in 100 years,\nare we going to be doing this 500 years?\nHow could that...\nIt's not going to be sustainable.\n- But in five years, for instance?\n- So I don't think so\nin the United States.\nI do think eventually\nyou're going to see something like that,\ncause there's going to be no way,\nand I think we're going to,\nI hope that we're going to\neventually come so strongly,\nwe're going to move on from this\nmodel of criminalizing drugs.\nThat we're really going to\nfocus on regulating drugs\nat the right level for that drug.\nAnd I like the word regulation\nbetter than legalization.\nI mean, I could imagine\nwhat one day regulation,\nsmart regulation, might\nmean for psychedelics.\nMaybe it could mean that there will be,\nwhether or not you have\na diagnosis of a problem,\nit may be that even for\npersonal exploration,\nyou can do this legally,\nbut you first have to maybe\ntake a court, get a drive.\nand this has been, I'm\nnot the first to say this,\nbut get equivalent of a driver's license.\nYou have to go to get\nsome sort of training.\nMaybe your first number of experiences\nneed to be with trained\nguides who can facilitate it.\nAnd then the public health information\nfor anyone using this,\nthat this is what risk your use is.\nAll use is going to have risks.\nThis is what risk your use is.\nThis is less risky use.\nThese are the factors.\nSo I think, eventually,\nwe're going to be...\nBut I would say the same\nthing for methamphetamine,\nand heroin, and cocaine.\nAll of these drugs,\nit's hard to imagine the current approach\nof just feeding a black market,\nand really exasperating a\nlot of the harms from drugs\nthat happens under the current model,\nit's hard to imagine maintaining.\nThat isn't to say,\nI think it should be in all\nof the 7-Elevens sold to kids.\nAt the other extreme-\n- I would hope not.\n- But I do think it's\nprobably not going to be soon\nin the United States.\nI do want to make the major point,\nthat even if psychedelics\nhad never been made illegal,\nI think the exact,\nthe trajectory of the\nmedical research right now\nwould still need to happen.\nIf it's effective as an antidepressant,\nwe need it to be...\nThere's all the evidence suggesting,\nthat whatever disorder\nwe're talking about,\nthe efficacy is going to be increased,\nand the risks are going to\nto be mitigated drastically\nin the types of models we're talking about\nwith the screening, with the preparation,\nwith the integration of\ncognitive behavioral therapy,\nor what have you,\ndepending on the\ndisorder, you're treating,\nwith the integration afterwards\nwith the professionals.\nWe would be doing it anyway.\nSo it's not like this versus that.\nSo I don't see it as a race\nbetween the decriminalization\nor legalization of these compounds\nversus their medical development.\nSome people who are psychedelic fans\nget all into a bunch about\nthe medical development.\nThey say, you guys want to like,\nyou want to keep it only for\nyour medical research in an ivory tower,\nand you want to be in\ncontrol of it as academics.\nAnd my take is, I didn't\nmake it illegal for anyone.\nWe're only moving the\nneedle in one direction.\nAnd again, even if it\nwas already illegal...\nAnd I've done plenty of survey\nresearch of people reporting\nthey took mushrooms for fun,\nor for personal exploration,\nand they said, my god, why am I smoking,\nand they quit smoking\n20 years because of it,\nor it's helped with their depression,\nor it's helped with them\novercoming alcoholism,\nor these [mumbles].\nSometimes that happens out of the blue\nwhen people use psychedelics.\nNone the less,\nobviously, the efficacy\nrates are going to be higher\nwhen you bring it into\nthese medical models,\nand it's going to be safer.\n- Sure.\n- So we need to be pushing that.\nAnd my best guess, is that\nMDMA is going to be approved\nwithin the next three years-\n- For a prescription\nby a physician?\n- Yes.\nAnd not just take two and\ncall me in the morning,\n- Right.\n- but in the clinics,\nthe way that those PTSD\ntrials are being run.\nSo the MDMA would be approved for PTSD,\nand every disorder needs\nto be looked at separately,\nand it's going to only be\napproved for those things.\nNow, there's going to be-\n- Right, 'cause approved,\nand legalized, and regulated,\nnow, we're getting into the nuance.\nI think when people hear\nit's going to be approved in two years,\nthey think that they'll\nbe able to buy, and sell,\nand use MDMA without legal consequences,\nand I do not think that's\ngoing to be the situation.\n- Right, that's not going to\nbe the case.\n- It's not the way it is.\nAnd I will say, that I think the,\nquote/unquote, \"psychedelic community\",\nI mean, they've been\ndoing what they want to,\nand will carry on doing what\nthey want to anyway, right?\nIt's not like the legal status has\n- [Dr. Matthew] Yeah.\n- prevented them from\ndoing what they're doing.\nIn fact, unlike Leary, and\nTimothy Leary, and Huxley,\nand some of the others\nthat were very vocal\nand lost their jobs,\nand some of 'em even\nwent to jail, et cetera.\nI mean, you've got a lot\nof public figures now,\nlike McKenna and others,\nwho are just basically out there\ntalking about psychedelics.\nMichael Pollan, who's more of a writer,\nfoodie guide gone psychedelic\ndabbler writer guy.\nI know he's kind of a polymath.\nYou know, the legal status\ndidn't seem to hinder their,\nat least, online careers.\nI don't know.\nI haven't looked at their bank accounts.\nBut I'm imagining they're doing just fine,\nright?\n- Right.\n- So the fact that the work is happening\ninside of big institutions,\nI think it's important that you point out,\nand I'm just trying to underscore,\nthat that's in no way antagonistic\nto what people are doing.\nIt's in support of a\ndifferent sort of mission,\nwhich is to explore the\nvalidity in different contexts\nin a really controlled way,\nwhich I really,\nI think it's a really important mission.\nI want to make sure that I ask you about\nthe other really important mission\nthat you're involved in with\nrespect to psychedelics,\nwhich is not about depression, per se,\nbut is about neurological,\nneurologic injury or head injury.\nI realize, it's early days for this,\nbut I think there's a lot of\nconcussion out there, sadly.\nThere's a lot of TBI,\ntraumatic brain injury.\n- Yeah.\n- Not just from sports.\nI think people sometimes\nforget that it's not,\nthe major source of traumatic\nhead injury is not football.\nIt's not hockey.\nIt's not boxing.\nIt's not any of that stuff.\nIt's construction workers,\n- Ah, yeah!\n- and it's-\n- Yeah.\n- I mean,\nif you've ever seen the helmets\nthat construction workers wear.\nI mean, that-\n- The jackhammer,\n- Yeah.\n- oh, my god.\n- The jack hammer-\n- I mean, how could that\nnot be just like-\n- Yeah.\nI have a colleague that works\non this in bioengineering.\nAnd when you look at the...\nYou know, we always think sports,\nbut there are many\npeople who make a living\nin a way that is,\nover time, is detrimental to their brain,\nand they don't have the option\nof just not being a professional athlete,\nor something of that sort.\n- And if they're not\ndoing the construction,\nsomeone else needs to it-\n- Someone else has\nto do it, right.\nAnd for some reason, and I, too,\nI didn't occur to me until I heard it,\nlike the people who\nare doing construction.\nAnd then, of course, bike\naccidents, and falls,\nand things like that as well.\nSo-\n- Military.\n- Military, absolutely.\n- Yeah.\n- So what do you think is the\npotential for these compounds,\nparticular psilocybin, but\nother compounds as well,\nfor the treatment and\npossible even reversal\nof neurological injuries,\nand what sorts of things\nare you excited to do in that realm?\n- Yeah, so this is definitely\non the more exploratory end.\nSo it's based upon...\nYou know, this is sort of beyond\nthe improvement of psychiatric disorders,\nlike depression, or depression anxiety\nassociated with a terminal illness,\nor a substance use\ndisorder, the addiction.\nSo those are sort of\npsychiatric disorders.\nSo this is...\nThere are anecdotes of people saying,\nthat psychedelics have\nhelped heal their brain.\nThey've been in one of these\nsituations, like in sports,\na sport where there's\nrepetitive head impact,\nand they're claiming\nthat using psychedelics\nhas actually improved\ntheir cognitive function,\nfor example, improve their memory,\nincluding improve their mood.\nBut it's kind of more of\nthe cognitive function,\nthings like memory are...\nNow, the caveat is,\nif you've successfully\nimproved someone's depression,\nyou can get some\ncognitive improvement too,\n- Sure.\n- but that's more\nof a weaker, more indirect effect.\nBut if you take these anecdotes,\nand you combine it way\nacross orders of analysis\nto the rodent research from several labs,\nlike David Olson, Brian Roth,\nthese folks that have shown\ndifferent forms of neural\nplasticity unfolding after,\nlike sort of post-acutely.\nso after, in the days following\nthe administration of\npsychedelic compounds,\na variety of psychedelic compounds,\nand even some non-psychedelic\nstructural analogs,\nthat you see these different\nforms of neural plasticity.\nSo the growth of dendrites,\nand new connections being\nformed with different neurons.\nThose effects may be at play,\nand then prove,\nin the psychiatric treatments\nthat we're dealing with,\nthat we don't know that.\nIt seems like a decent guess,\nand we're going to be figuring\nout whether that's the case.\nBut another potential that sets up,\nis that maybe that's, what's going on\nwith these claims of improvements\nfrom neurological issues,\nthat there's actually\nrepair of the brain from injuries\nunderlying things that...\nSituations where there's\nrepetitive head impact,\nperhaps there's a potential for\nhelping folks recover from stroke,\nand disorders like that.\nThere's a wide variety of disorders.\nNow, it's a bit of\nmagic, and a bit of like,\nit's something that\nthe enthusiasts kind of\ncan do some hand waving,\nand claim that this is already known.\nIt is more exploratory.\nBut what I'm hoping to do with some work\nwith retired athletes\nwho had been exposed.\nBy the nature of their sport, for example,\nMMA athletes in the UFC\nwho have been exposed to\nrepetitive head impacts,\nlike a lot of sports expose people to,\nand who are retired from the sport,\nand are suffering from, say, depression,\nwhich can, impart, result\nfrom those types of,\nthat history of head impact.\nSee if we can fix the depression,\nbut then also as a cherry on top,\nin a more exploratory aim,\nsee if we can have evidence of\nimprovement in cognitive function,\nand associate like using MRI\nto see if it affects\ngray matter over time,\nthese types of things,\nto see if there actually is\nsome evidence of this improved,\nlike this more direct repair of the brain.\nBut again, it is very sort of like,\nwe've got some rodent data.\nWe've got some human anecdotes.\n- We will acknowledge it's early days,\nand we look forward to seeing the data.\nI appreciate how cautious you are,\nattentive you are.\nYou're not drawing any conclusions.\nI think from a purely logical\nand somewhat mechanistic perspective,\nI mean, if we assume that\nlack of ability to focus,\nor degradation and mood is the\nreflection of neurons in the brain,\nI think we can agree on that,\nsome dialogue between\nneurons and the brain,\nand that what needs to be changed\nis the nature of that dialogue,\naka, neural plasticity.\nWe know that reordering of\nneural circuitry require,\nin the adult, requires these things,\nlike intense focus,\nfollowed by rest, et cetera.\nBut the basis for that,\nlike beneath, focuses the mechanism,\nis a mechanism, rather,\nbeneath the bin that we call\ndeep rest is a mechanism,\nand those mechanisms are\nneuromodulator driven.\nSo, to me, you're...\nI'm not reviewing your grant.\nBut from a rational perspective,\nit seems that drugs that\nincrease certain neuromodulators,\nlike serotonin or dopamine,\nin a controlled way,\nand then coupling that\nwith learning of some sort,\nsensory input of some sort,\nit makes sense that would lead to,\ncould, I should say,\nlead to reordering of circuitry\nthat would allow for better\nthinking, better mood,\nmany of the same things\nthat you've observed\nin the clinical trials for depression.\nSo the rationale is really strong.\nI think that's a very exciting area.\nI get asked all the time about TBI,\nand traumatic brain injury,\nand right now, it's kind of,\nthere isn't a whole\nlot that people can do,\nand people are dabbling in\nthe space of hyperbaric chambers,\nand people will do sauna and breath work,\nand people are kind of\nclipping at the margins\nof what really is a problem\nthat resides deep to the skull.\nSo I think, I just want to\napplaud the exploration.\nI think it's great,\nprovided that exploration is\nbeing done in a controlled way.\nIt sounds like that's what\nyou're doing with the UFC?\n- Yeah, so that's-\n- A great-\n- They were really gracious,\nand had myself and a few of my colleagues\nout to their headquarters in Vegas,\nand-\n- Impressive place, right?\n- It's in process.\n- Yeah.\n- You know,\nthere's a dialogue going on there.\nI'm hopeful that there's going\nto be some work with them.\nBut it's in process now,\nin terms of exploring it.\nThere's a real interest,\nand I'm just really\nimpressed by the organization\nand their commitment\n- Yeah.\n- to athlete health,\nand we'll see.\n- I am too.\nYeah, I am too.\nWe have a colleague out there.\nWe're doing a little\nbit of work with them.\nDunkin French, who's a serious\nacademic in his own right.\nAnd I think when people hear UFC,\nthey just think about the\noctagon, and fighting,\nand Pay-per-view fights, and things.\nBut in talking with them,\nand I'm sure you've had\nthese discussions as well,\nthey are very much\ninterested in the health\nand longevity of their fighters.\nThey are also interested in the health\nand longevity of their\nfighters being a template\nfor how to treat traumatic brain injury,\nand improve human\nperformance in other sports,\nand in the general public.\nAnd I think it's not an image of the UFC\nthat commonly comes to mind,\n'cause they haven't been\nparticularly verbal about it in the press.\nBut I think it's great\nthey're bringing in academics.\nI mean, geeks like us\ngoing out to the UFC Performance center.\nI mean, you do MMA,\nbut I'm basically just a geek\nwalking through the place.\nBut the fact that they're interested\nin talking to scientists is really,\nI'm biased here,\nbut a point in their favor.\nAlong the lines of other groups\nand individuals that\nhave impacted the space\nthat you're working in in this pioneering\nof the psychedelic space,\na few years ago, I think,\nif someone submitted a grant saying,\nI want to study how psilocybin\nimpacts human depression,\nI'm guessing, having worked\non these panels before,\nthat the response might've been closer to,\nwell, we need to do a lot\nof studies in rodents,\nand a lot of studies in primates,\nand then maybe, just maybe,\nwe could explore these drugs,\nbecause the National Institutes\nof Health actually has\na whole institute devoted\nto addiction, right?\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Of exploring compounds\nonly in terms of their negative effects,\nright?\n- Yeah.\n- Which is a very-\n- NIDA,\nwhich is where I've gotten\nall of my NIH funding\nover my career.\n- Which is so interesting,\nright?\n- Yeah, uh-huh.\n- And it's a super important institute.\nI want to be clear,\nthere are amazing people there.\nBut philanthropy and foundations have been\nvery important in supporting\npioneering research,\nand so maybe we just talk\na little bit about that?\nSo your lab receives funding\nfrom taxpayer dollars\nthrough the National Institutes of Health?\nIs that mainly where\nyour funding comes from?\n- So our group has gotten\nsome funding from like,\nsay, the National Institute\non Drug Abuse, NIDA.\nFor some, a small subset\nof the psychedelic work,\nbut only for some work geared towards\nunderstanding these\nthings as drugs of abuse.\n- Right.\n- Of course,\nwhen you do a study, though,\n[interposing voices]\n- Explore how they're bad.\n- Right.\n- Right, right.\nBut when you're doing that,\nyou can explore like the good stuff too.\nBut the large majority of the work,\nand the most interesting work,\nhas been funded by philanthropy.\n- Private philanthropy.\n- Now, I still have\nsome grant support from NIDA\noutside of psychedelics.\n- Right.\n- I'm shifting more\nand more of my time towards\nfocusing only on psychedelics.\nAnd in fact, us getting\nthe center-level funding\nfrom some really big\npicture philanthropists\nhelped me to start to\nmake that transition.\nBut groups like the Heffter\nResearch organization,\nDennis McKenna, which is\none of the founding members,\nthe brother of Terence McKenna,\nwho is, by the way, an ethnobotanist.\nThat's what his PhD is in.\n- What does that mean,\nethnobtanist?\n- Studying, essentially, the anthropology\nof psychoactive plant use.\nSo, you know-\n- Wow!\nYou can get a degree in that?\n- Yeah, yeah, yeah.\nYou know, hanging out with cultures,\nand studying their use of these compounds\nin the traditional ways.\n- Wow!\nAt Hopkins?\nThat degree exists at Johns Hopkins?\n- I don't think that\ndegree exists at Hopkins,\n- Oh, okay.\n- but I mean,\nkind of the most...\nAs you know from academia, I'm not...\nYou know, sometimes folks...\nI'm not sure how many people's PhD\nis actually in ethnobotany,\nor if it's actually in\n- Yeah, I've never heard of-\n- something else.\nBut the real focus is...\nMy degree is general\nexperimental psychology.\n- Ten thousand kids out there just decided\nthey're going to major in ethnobotany,\nbut, you know-\n- I mean,\none of the pioneers of\nthe psychedelic area,\nbefore Leary, and before,\nand actually, he was late,\neven for the human researchers.\nFolks like Humphry\nOsmond, and Abram Hoffer,\nand Sidney Cohen were earlier.\nBut even before those folks,\nRichard Schultes at Harvard,\nI mentioned him earlier\nin the conversation,\ndiscovered all of this now.\nThese various tribes\nusing ayahuasca or yagé,\na different name for the same thing,\nthroughout South America,\nand these DMT containing\nsnuffs, and all of this.\nSo that was ethnobotany,\nthis kind of intersection of anthropology\nand these psychoactive plant compounds.\nSo the Heffter Research Institute,\nwhich Dennis is a founding\nand active member of,\na board member,\nthey have funded a lot of our early work.\nThere's also an organization called\nthe Beckley Institute based in England,\nthat a lady, Amanda Feilding,\nhas been the head of,\nthat has...\nThey provided the first funding\nfor our psilocybin smoking\ncessation research,\nand then Heffter came in and\nprovided subsequent funding.\nAnd then there are other groups.\nThe Council on Spiritual Practices.\nA great guy named Bob Jesse\nfunded some of the\noriginal work at Hopkins,\nlooking at the nature\nof mystical experience\noutside of treating disease\nstates or disorders.\nBut just\n[Huberman speaks indistinctly]\nunderstanding these...\nLike people take these compounds,\nand astonishingly, frequently, will say,\nthat was the most important\nthing I've ever experienced.\nAnd it's like, what the hell is that?\nYou know?\n- I had someone\nmention recently,\nand I think this might\nsurprise people a little bit.\nIt's certainly surprised me.\nI had a friend who adores his children.\nHe's got three children.\nHe adores his children.\nHappy marriage and a great father.\nThey're both great parents.\nAnd he told me, that as\npart of a clinical trial,\nhe had a DMT experience that he claims,\nhe said, \"I'd love to tell you\nthat the birth of my\nchildren was as profound,\nbut that was a more profound experience\nthan the birth of my children,\nany one of them and all of them combined\".\nAnd I was like, \"Wow!\"\nNow, I've never done DMT,\nbut I was like, \"Wow, that's\na pretty strong statement\".\nNow, he did it in the context\nof one of these clinical explorations\nI assume that was part of\na legal clinical trial.\nI mean, that's saying something.\n- Yeah.\n- It's saying something.\nI mean, he's a very rational,\nvery grounded guy, otherwise.\nSo philanthropy foundations.\n- Yeah.\n- And then in-\n- Most recently,\nand sorry, just I can't,\n- Mm-hmm, yeah.\n- 'cause I can't skip it.\nOur center level funding\n- Oh, yeah,\nyou can't skip-\n- which came at\na year and a half,\n- I see.\n- that's like, we...\nI mean, the Heffter\ngroup, the Beckley group,\nI mean, these are wonderful.\nI mean, these are people\nthat have been holding the flame alive\nduring the darkest hours.\nSame thing with the MAPS organization\nmore on the MDMA side,\nlike holding that candle\nduring the darkest years.\nYou know, so we've...\nSmaller organizations\nconnected to smaller,\nbut growing over time, pockets of wealth.\nBut we basically limped along on a wing\nand a prayer until recently,\nwhen we got the $17 million gift,\nso that we could create a nominal center.\nAnd as you know,\nbasically, to the university,\nthat means you get a\ncertain number of dollars,\nand a lot of them, you can\ncall yourself a center.\nIt's a capital investment.\nStaff, equipment, salary, support,\nwhich has always been\nthe huge thing for us.\nBut the $17 million gift,\nwhich was split between\nthe Cohen foundation,\nso Steven and Alexandra Cohen,\nthey covered half of it,\nand the other half, the\nTim Ferriss collaborative.\nBasically, Tim and a\nfew friends ponied up,\ndivided the rest of that,\nhalf of that $17 million gift,\nand came together to just...\nI mean, it's completely transformed our,\nthe work that we've done,\nand our ability to fully\ndelve into this area,\nand not worry that, like,\noh, if I focus on this,\nrather than putting\nanother three NIDA grants\non some other topic that\nmay or may not get funded,\nif I focus too much on the psychedelics,\nam I putting my career at jeopardy?\nLike so-\n- But you're now\nnot only a tenured professor,\nyou're also a full endowed-\n- Right.\nSo that came-\n- By the way,\nwhen you say somebody is\na fully endowed professor,\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\n- I want to be very clear\nwhat that means.\nThat means that\nthere's funding-\n- Well, it might mean\nall of the above, but\nno, I'm joking [laughs].\n- I have no knowledge of\nyour particular situation,\nbut you probably do.\n- Just kidding.\n- But sure.\nWhat we're essentially saying,\nis that funding,\nwhich does not change\nsomebody's salary level...\nI just want to be clear,\n'cause I think the general public isn't...\nThere's no reason why\nthey would understand\nall the nuts and bolts of how this works.\n- Academia is weird.\n- Yeah.\nAcademia is weird,\nbecause we're not\ntalking about increasing.\nWe're not talking about an endowment\nor philanthropy that went\nto increase Matt's salary.\nThat something that's set\nat the university level.\nIt's always been said,\nand it is, at least, is still true now,\nwhich is that nobody goes\ninto science for the money,\nat least not at the academic level,\nnot in academia.\nBut allows people to\ndevote more of their time\nand energy to these exploratory realms,\nlike psychedelic research,\nor the case of my lab,\nthe work that we're doing\nwith David Spiegel's lab,\non respiration breath work\nand hypnosis for modulating brain states.\nThese are not typically areas\nthat the National Institutes of Health\nand other major organizations have,\ninstitutions set up to support.\nNow, there is an exciting initiative,\nwhich is the NCCIH,\nwhich is Complimentary Health.\n- Right.\nUsed to be NCCAM.\n- Yep.\n- Yeah,\nand they changed their name.\n- At NIH.\n- Yeah.\n- And now,\nwe're not just throwing out acronyms\njust to bat back and forth acronyms.\nBut I think what we're looking,\nwhat we're seeing now\nis a movement toward science,\nand scientists, and clinicians,\nand the general public, and\nphilanthropy being engaged\nin this dialogue, which says,\nokay, there are problems in the world,\ndepression, head trauma,\npsychological trauma, PTSD, ADHD.\nThese problems clearly exist.\nThe solutions are going\nto involve behaviors\nthat are going to involve nutrition,\nsupplementation, social connection.\nHowever, there are drugs,\nthere are compounds that\ncan change the brain,\nand allow the brain to\nchange its circuitry through experience,\nand psychedelics are\none of several others,\nbut one of the powerful\nleavers, it sounds like.\nAnd I just want to say,\nthat I think the reason\nI reached out to you,\nand I'm so excited to sit\ndown and chat with you is,\nbecause I see very few people\ninside the halls of academia\nwho have thrown their arms around\nthis issue of psychedelics in a way,\nand gone through the trouble of trying to\nfind the funding to get it done,\ngone through the trouble\nof trying to set up clinical trials.\nI know what's involved in doing this.\nIt's so complicated.\nIt's so time-consuming and painstaking.\nAnd you've made real progress.\nI mean, you guys are publishing papers.\nThere's a new dialogue emerging\nthat isn't just books on bookshelves\nand psychedelic, psychonaut\ngurus on the internet,\nwho also play an important role.\nBut you're really moving\nthis field forward.\nAnd I know there are others as well.\nThere are colleagues in\nEngland and others as well.\nWe acknowledge them.\nBut I just want to say personally,\nthat I'm inspired\nand impressed by the way\nthat you've gone about this,\nand the level of rigor.\nI mean, when I ask you a\nquestion about serotonin,\nmost people will just\nkind of kick back to me,\nwell, yeah, you got receptors,\nand you've got a ligand,\nbut I mean, it's clear to me\nthat you care about the details,\nand that you care about\nthe future of this area,\nand you also really care\nabout these patients\nand these individuals.\nSo I know I'm speaking on\nbehalf of a ton of people now,\nand in the future,\nthat don't even know what\nthey're going to receive\nas a consequence of this.\nI just want to voice a real sincere\nthank you for that effort.\nIt's like your lab and your work matters,\nand that's a really\nspecial and unique thing.\n- I appreciate that.\nIn fact, I had a good colleague,\nin fact, she shared some grants support\nunder the multi-PI system years ago,\nand she actually took a job\nat NIH as a review officer.\nAnd I remember her telling me...\nAnd she actually left when\nshe had multiple RO1s.\nSo it's like-\n- RO1s are kind of\nthe bread and butter,\n- Big picture grant.\n- big grants\n- Yeah.\n- that every card carrying...\nIt's a mark of respect in our community\nto have one or several of these, yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nIt's like you eat what\nyou kill in academia.\nIt gets to what we were\ntalking about later,\nit's like you don't make more\nmoney by pulling more grants,\nbut you're able to pay the salary that...\nThe university doesn't\npay you your salary.\nIt goes through them.\n- Right.\nYou're just able to do more work.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- And you're able to...\nAnd if you don't pull in the\ngrants to cover your salary,\nyour job can come to an end.\nEven if you're tenured\nat a place like Hopkins,\nthey can do tricks,\nlike slowly lower\nyour salary over-\n- Well, they just let-\n[interposing voices]\nOr they just take away your space.\n- Yeah, they put you in a closet,\nand give you no support for trainees,\nand basically make life hell for you.\nSo you can drive\n- It happens.\n- a cab in Baltimore,\nand call yourself a full\nprofessor at Hopkins, truthfully,\nbut you may not have no ability\nto get anything done.\n- I'm sure they're out there.\n- But yeah, I remember one of the things\nthis colleague has said,\nwho's is successful, but left on top said,\n\"I really don't know\nthat I'm making a\ndifference in the world?\"\nAnd she did some great memory research\nand connected to drugs,\nalso connected to aging.\nBut she said, \"I don't feel the impact\nof what I'm doing in the real world\".\nUnfortunately, there,\nfor a lot of academia,\nwhat we do, it stays in the ivory tower.\nThe world is a...\n- Not anymore.\n- It's a beautiful,\nbut messed up place,\n[Dr. Huberman laughs]\nand a lot of this doesn't disseminate,\n- [Dr. Huberman] Right.\n- because of the various structures,\nthe way the world is set up.\nAnd thankfully, this...\nI mean, because the work that our group,\nas well as a few others around the world,\nover the last 20 years,\nit's like you do have an emerging\npsychedelic startup industry now\nwith billions of dollars of investment.\nAnd yeah, that's going to\nturn into both good and bad.\nYou know, it's upping the ante.\nThere's going to be a lot of good\nand bad that comes from that,\n- Sure.\n- but any new technology\nis going to result in that.\nBut we've got psilocybin\ndesignated for two separate entities\nas a breakthrough therapy by the FDA,\nand people may not realize,\nand the MDMA is designated\nas a breakthrough therapy for PTSD.\nThis is a really big deal.\nThat's a very high...\nI mean, pharma companies\nwould pay millions of dollars\nto get their new drug a\ndesignation like that.\nAnd what it means,\nis early research is showing,\nsaying it shows a high\npotential for treating disorders\nthat don't have very good treatments.\nAnd we're probably, again, a\nfew years away from both MDMA,\nprobably a year or two,\nafter that psilocybin,\nand being treated for PTSD\nand depression respectively.\nYou know, we have to wait\nfor the Phase 3 studies,\nbut if the results hold up...\nEven if the effect size is halved\nof what we're seeing now,\nit's still going to be a lot larger\nthan what you're seeing with\nthe traditional medications.\nAnd so it's going to be\napproved, if the data hold up,\nand it probably will from my judgment.\nSo I feel like what I'm doing\nis actually having a\npositive impact in the world\nin a way that...\nAnd I feel lucky that I\ngot interested in an area\nthat happens to plug\ninto a place in the world\nwhere there is that opportunity,\nwhere some great colleagues\nand friends are focused on areas\nwhere I wish they had the opportunity\nfor their work to be disseminated.\nI mean, I was lucky to be interviewed\non \"60 Minutes\" because of this work.\nAnd I was like, oh, my\ngod, I know so many...\nThere's a bit of imposter syndrome,\nlike, oh, my god, I\nknow so many scientists\nthat deserve, more so than me, to be,\nhad that level of exposure.\nBut if you happen to\nbe in that place where,\nyou got to do your best to make it work,\nto take advantage of that luck,\nand that intersection of\nthe world, and to push it.\nI've been lucky,\nbut I also did take a bit\nof a leap of faith early on.\nI did have some advisors\nthat told me, like,\nyou've got a really\npromising pedigree early on,\nlike, are you sure you want to focus\nmuch time on this psychedelic stuff?\n- Yeah, you've embraced risk.\nI mean, I think that...\nI mean, the world's changed\nsince, in 2020, certainly,\nbut channels like social media, podcasts,\nand things of that sort,\nyour exposure is\nbecause people are\ninterested in these topics,\nand that's why people, like myself,\nare interested in talking to you.\nI mean at Stanford,\nthere are now a few labs\nstarting to explore psychedelics,\nmore at the mechanistic level,\nso in animal models.\nSome excellent labs.\nBut also, I can imagine,\nbecause of the pioneering work\nthat you've done at Hopkins,\nit'll start to become more common.\nI'm certain that people are\ngoing to have questions about\nhow to get in contact\nwith you and learn more.\nIf people have trauma, PTSD, depression,\nit's likely that they're\ngoing start seeking ways\nin which they can potentially\nparticipate in clinical trials.\nYou're very active on Twitter.\nActive, I should say.\nYou've got other obligations,\nbut where you are active on social media,\nyou're active on Twitter.\nIt's @drug_researcher,\ncorrect?\n- Right, right.\nRight.\n- Okay.\nSo get-\n- It's drug_researcher,\nthat's how to find me.\n- A great account, by the way.\nMatthew and I recently\ngot into a dialogue there\nabout some of the deeper\neffects of psychedelics\nin the literature versus\nhow they're being discussed\nin the general public.\nI follow his account,\nand it's a really wonderful account for\nwhether or not you have a\nscience background or not.\nIf people are...\nAnd I'm going to try and persuade you\nto be more active on Instagram,\nbut I don't know\nif I'll succeed in that.\n[Dr. Matthew laughs]\n- I'll try to get my\nInstagram game going on.\n- You're a busy guy,\nand I get it.\nI'm running a lab too.\nI get it.\nYou're busy.\nDrug_researcher there as well.\n- The same handle, huh?\n- The same handle.\nYour lab at Hopkins is pretty\nstraightforward to find\nthrough a Google Search of your name,\nMatthew Johnson, Johns Hopkins University.\nAre there portals for people\nto explore clinical trials,\nparticipation in clinical\ntrials of various kinds?\n- Yeah, and so in our group,\nso you go to Hopkinspsychedelic.org.\nThat's the website.\nAnd if you can't remember that,\njust Johns Hopkins\npsychedelic.\n- We will provide a link.\nYeah, we will provide a link.\n- Yeah,\nand you're going to find us.\nIt'll be the first thing that pops up.\nAnd we have...\nTrust me, if we have a study on something,\nit's going to be on that website.\n- That means-\n[interposing voices]\nThey're being very polite,\nso I will be a little bit\nmore aggressive, and say,\ndon't email him directly.\nHe won't see that email.\nWait until there's a posting for a study,\nand then sign up through\nthe correct portal.\n- Right.\nAnd I try to get back to those emails,\nbut frankly, and it's 'cause I'm lucky\nthe area has taken off so much,\nbut there are many days\nwhere I simply get so many\n- Well, you have to do-\n- requests that I can't\nget through my day.\n- You have to do the research.\n- Yeah, if I answer all the...\nSo yeah, trust me.\nAnd something that a\nlot of folks don't get,\nand being in academia like we are,\nit's easy to forget how people don't,\nunderstandably, don't realize this.\nThis is experimental research.\nIt's FDA-approved as an experiment,\nso we're working towards\nformal FDA approval\nfor straight up clinical use.\nBut right now, someone\ncan't bring me a case\nof some idiosyncratic thing, and say,\nI'm suffering from this\ncomplex constellation,\nlike depression-\n- You're not a clinician.\n- Yeah, I'm not...\nAnd even if I was,\nI wouldn't be able to\ntreat them with psilocybin,\nor to send them anywhere\nthat was legal to take it.\nSo if we're going to be treating you,\nit has to be,\nor anyone else in the United States,\nor most other countries for that matter,\nit's going to have to be under the guise\nof a very specific protocol.\nThis number of milligrams to treat PTSD,\nto treat major depressive disorder,\nto treat, treatment resistant\ntobacco use disorder,\nso nicotine addiction.\nVery specific studies.\nThis is not one-off treatment.\nAnd folks say, like, oh, I can\npay to go out to Baltimore.\nWell, my son has this complex.\nAnd they're tragic cases, but you...\nSo if you're interested in\na study, go to our website.\nIf it's not on their website,\nwe don't have a study on it.\nThere are going to be forthcoming studies.\nSo I'm going to be starting studies\non opioid addiction and PTSD,\nand an LSD study for chronic pain.\nThe day that those are\nopen for recruitment,\nthey're going to be up on our website.\n- Great.\n- So that's where\nyou look to see everything.\nAnd in fact, I just recently,\na couple of days ago,\nput up a couple of surveys studies,\nalso where we post a\nlink to our survey study.\nSo if you've had psychedelics,\nand you've taken them for\ntherapeutic intent for PTSD,\nor for depression, or anxiety,\nyou can find a link.\nAnd also, if you've done\nbreath work for those reasons,\nwe have a link for a study\nof that type up there now,\nwhich is a holotropic-style,\na very psychedelic-type\n- Interesting.\n- of breathing technique\nthat can lead to some of\nthese similar experiences.\nSo it's up there.\nMore broadly, outside of our group,\n'cause there's a growing number\nof groups in the US doing this,\nand in Europe doing this research,\nbut you can go to Clinicaltrials.gov,\nand if you look in for the\nmain search term of psilocybin,\nor MDMA, or psychedelic,\nplug in those terms,\nyou can get a list of the growing number.\nI mean, I think there's over 40, maybe.\nIt's been awhile.\nThere might be over 50 now.\nI don't know.\nBut studies with just psilocybin going on\nright now on Clinicaltrials.gov.\nSo check out Clinicaltrials.gov\nto see what's going on.\nBut it's going to be...\nIf you're going to do anything legal,\nit's going to be in the context\nof a very specific study.\nIt's not going to be one-off treatment.\n- Right, and I should say,\n- Yeah.\n- and not just legal,\nbut also supported in the right framework\nthat you described,\nof having a team, et cetera.\nObviously, people will\ndo what they will do.\n[interposing voices]\n- And if-\n- Oh, yeah, go ahead.\n- I will say, if people...\nI never encourage people\nto take drugs of any...\nI don't encourage caffeine use.\nEvery drug has its risk,\nyou know?\n- I encourage\nmy own caffeine use,\nbut nobody else's.\n- Yeah.\nI'm drinking up right now.\nThis is great.\n- Yeah,\nthis is a very strong maté.\nIt's what we're drinking.\nIt has not lead to a alteration,\nin my perception, of self\nto the extent that we\ntalked about earlier.\nHowever, this conversation,\nwas a good example\nof how we can enter a perceptual bubble.\nI learned so much about psychedelics,\nand the future of this\nfor the sake of mental health,\nand other aspects of health.\nMatt, thank you so much\n- Thank you, Andrew.\n- for your time,\nfor your knowledge.\nAnd I think you put it best earlier,\nfor holding the candle\nin a very dark time,\nand then now, there's light.\n- Thank you.\nWell, thanks for helping\nto spread that light,\nand I really appreciate\nwhat you've been doing.\nThis is a
