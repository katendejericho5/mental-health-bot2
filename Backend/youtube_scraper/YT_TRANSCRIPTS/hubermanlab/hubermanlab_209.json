    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n- I'm Andrew Huberman.\nAnd I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk all about healthy\nand disordered eating.\nAnd indeed, we are going to talk\nabout clinical eating disorders,\nsuch as anorexia, bulimia,\nand binge eating disorder,\nas well as some other\nrelated eating disorders.\nHowever, before we get into this material,\nI want to emphasize that\ntoday's discussion will include\nwhat it is to have a healthy\nrelationship with food.\nWe're going to talk about metabolism.\nWe're going to talk about\nhow eating frequency\nand what one eats influences\nthings like appetite\nand satiety, as well as whether\nor not we have a healthy,\npsychological relationship\nto food and our body weight\nand so-called body composition,\nthe ratio of muscle to fat,\nto bone, et cetera.\nSo, as we march into this conversation,\nI'd like to share with\nyou some interesting\nand what I believe are\nimportant findings in the realm\nof nutrition and human behavior.\nI know these days,\nmany people are excited about or curious\nabout so-called intermittent fasting,\nintermittent fasting\nis as the name implies,\nsimply restricting one's feeding behavior,\neating to a particular\nphase of the 24 hour\nor so-called circadian cycle.\nOther forms of intermittent\nfasting involve not eating\nfor extended periods of\ntime for an entire days,\nor some people will extend to two days\nor three days typically.\nAnd hopefully they will drink\nwater during those times,\nsometimes referred to as water fasting,\nwhich means that they\nare ingesting fluids.\nAnd hopefully they are ingesting\nelectrolytes such as salt,\npotassium and magnesium as well,\nbecause well one can\nsurvive for some period\nof time without ingesting calories,\nit is extremely important\nto continue to ingest plenty\nof fluids and electrolytes.\nAnd the reason for that is\nthat the neurons of your brain\nand body that control your\nmovements, your thoughts,\nclarity of thinking in general, et cetera,\nis critically dependent on the\npresence of adequate levels\nof sodium, potassium and\nmagnesium, the electrolytes.\nAnd that's because neurons can\nonly be electrically active\nby way of movement of particular ions,\nwhich include things like\nsodium potassium and magnesium.\nSo, without those,\nyou can't think, you can't\nfunction and it actually\ncan be quite dangerous.\nSo, why all the excitement\nabout intermittent fasting?\nWell, a lot of the excitement\nrelates to work that was done\nby a former colleague of mine,\ndown at the Salk Institute\nfor Biological Studies\nin San Diego, named Satchin Panda,\nSatchin's lab identified\nsome very important\nand impactful health\nbenefits of restricting\none's feeding window to particular\nwithin the 24 hour cycle,\nor even to having extended\nfasts that go for a day\nor two days, or maybe even three days.\nWhat they saw was an improvement\nin liver enzymes and improvement\nin insulin sensitivity,\nwhich is something that is good.\nIt means that you can utilize the calories\nand the blood sugar\nthat you happen to have,\nbeing insulin insensitive is not good,\nand is actually a form of diabetes.\nWhat Satchin's lab and\nsubsequently other labs showed,\nwas that restricting one's\nfeeding window to anywhere\nfrom four to eight or even 12 hours\nduring each 24 hour cycle\nwas beneficial in mice.\nAnd some studies in humans have also shown\nthat it can be beneficial for\nvarious health parameters.\nHowever, the excitement about\nintermittent fasting seems\nto be related to the foundational\ntruth about metabolism\nand weight loss and weight\nmaintenance and weight gain,\nwhich is that regardless of\nwhether or not you intermittent\nfast or whether or not you\neat small meals all day long,\nor you eat one meal in the\nevening and snack up until then,\nit really doesn't matter in\nthe sense that the calories\nthat you ingest from whatever source,\nare going to be filtered through\nthe calories that you burn,\nby way of exercise, basal metabolic rate,\nwhich is just the calories\nthat you happen to burn,\njust being alive and\nthinking and breathing\nand your heart beating, et cetera.\nAnd the reason why many people\nwill prefer intermittent\nfasting to other forms of let's\njust call it what it is diet\nor nutritional framework is\nthat many people find it easier\nto not eat, then to\nlimit their portion size.\nAnd here I'm not talking\nnecessarily about eating disorders.\nI'm talking about the general population.\nSo, I think that's one reason\nwhy there's so much excitement\nabout intermittent fasting.\nNow, within the context\nof intermittent fasting\non a circadian timescale,\nonce every 24 hours,\nyou generally find two\ncategories of people,\npeople who prefer to\nnot eat in the morning,\neither because they are\nnot hungry in the morning,\nor because they find it\nrelatively straightforward\nto just drink things like\ncoffee or water, et cetera,\nand push their feeding window\nout to noon or 2:00 P.M.\nor 3:00 P.M. and then they'll eat between,\nsay 1:00 P.M. and 8:00 P.M. or 9:00 P.M..\nIt depends on the individual.\nOther groups of people find\nthat they are very hungry\nwhen they wake up in the morning,\nthey don't feel well if\nthey don't eat breakfast.\nAnd so they prefer to\neat early in the day,\nbut then they limit their\nfeeding window such that they cut\noff their food intake or\nstop ingesting any calories\nof any kind, somewhere around 5:00 P.M.\nor 6:00 P.M., et cetera.\nSo, the duration of the feeding window\nhas not been broken down\ninto the kind of nuanced type\nof information that one would really want.\nAt least not in human studies saying,\nwell, a six hour feeding window\nor an eight hour feeding window is ideal.\nIt really is going to\nvary based on lifestyle\nand circumstances, for instance,\nsome families really want\nto eat dinner together every night.\nSo, do you want to be\nthe person that's sitting\nthere watching everybody eat?\nBecause you're fasting\nfrom 5:00 P.M. onwards?\nI don't know.\nThat's an individual difference.\nWhat you can start to identify, however,\nis that people tend to fall\ninto either one category.\nThe other people who prefer\nto skip eating in the morning\nor people that prefer to,\nor managed to skip eating in the evening.\nAnd there has been no evidence thus far,\nthat one is better or worse,\nat least in terms of weight loss\nor overall health parameters.\nNow, you can imagine that some people\nmight eat breakfast and dinner.\nAnd indeed I have several many colleagues\nin fact who just choose to skip lunch,\nbecause they're busy during the day,\nthey eat breakfast and dinner,\nthat doesn't afford the long,\nfast associated with sleep.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if you went to sleep at 11:00 P.M.\nand you wake up at 6:00 A.M.\nby extending your fast until\n1:00 P.M. in the afternoon,\nyou get quite a long period\nof no ingesting any calories.\nWhereas when you don't eat\nduring the middle of the day,\nyou are getting a fasting period.\nThat's probably anywhere\nfrom four to seven hours,\nbut it's not linked to\nthe longer fasting period\nof not eating while you\nare asleep, because most,\nall people and I want to emphasize most,\ndo not eat while they are asleep.\nBut we are going to talk\nabout any new disorder\nthat does exist, where people\nactually eat in their sleep.\nI know it sounds pretty\nwild, but indeed it,\nthat eating disorder does exist.\nAnd it has a very interesting\nunderlying mechanism.\nSo, why are we talking about this?\nAnd in particular, why are\nwe talking about this during\nan episode that includes a discussion\nabout eating disorders?\nThe reason is, nobody not the\ngovernment, no nutritionists,\nno individual, no matter how knowledgeable\nthey are about food and\nnutrition and food intake,\ncan define the best plan for\neating for any one individual.\nI'm going to repeat that.\nNobody knows what truly healthy eating is.\nWe only know the measurements\nwe can take, liver enzymes,\nblood lipid profiles, body\nweight, athletic performance,\nmental performance, whether\nor not you're cranky all day,\nwhether or not you're feeling relaxed,\nnobody knows how to define these.\nAnd these have strong\ncultural and familial\nand socio-societal influence.\nSo, if you hang out with people\nthat intermittent fast all\nday, that will seem normal.\nIf you spend time with\npeople that have never heard\nof intermittent fasting,\nintermittent fasting is\ngoing to seem very abnormal.\nNow we are going to talk\nabout eating disorders\nthat really fall into the category\nof clinically diagnosable\neating disorders,\nfor which there's actually\nserious health hazards\nand even the serious risk of death,\nwe will get to that topic.\nBut for the time being,\nI want to emphasize a new set of findings\nthat I think many people\nwill find interesting.\nAnd at least we'll want\nto consider in light\nof their current nutritional\nplan or pattern of eating,\nwhether or not you're\nintermittent fasting or not.\nAnd I want to cue up\nan important framework\nfor the rest of the\nconversation on healthy\nand disordered eating,\nwhich includes an understanding\nof thinking, decision-making\nand what we call homeostatic processes,\nmeaning regulation of things\nthat are going on in our brain\nand body and reward mechanisms.\nSo, I'm going to return\nto that in a moment,\nbut first I want to share\nwith you these new findings\nthat were just published in\nthe Journal Cell Reports,\na Cell Press Journal, excellent journal.\nThis was a study that was\nperformed both in mice\nand it included a crossover\nstudy with a human population.\nThe human population was women,\nbut it relates to a previous\nstudy that was also carried\nout in men.\nI'm going to simplify this study.\nWe will provide a link to the\nfull study so you can explore\nit in more detail.\nAnd if you're really\nexcited about the results,\nI would encourage you to\nexplore some of the references\nwithin that paper as well.\nWhat was the study?\nThe study looked at giving\nmice or humans, two meals.\nAnd explored whether or not\nputting those meals early\nin the day or late in the day,\nhad an impact on muscle hypertrophy,\nmuscle growth and overall\nprotein synthesis of muscle.\nSo, when we eat, the amino\nacids from various foods\nare broken down and synthesized\ninto different types of tissues.\nThey can be utilized for energy,\nburned up for moving about\nand thinking et cetera,\nor it can be synthesize.\nThose amino acids can be\nsynthesized into skeletal muscle.\nThe sorts of skeletal\nmuscles that allow you\nto move your limbs.\nThis study explored how protein intake,\nwhich included what are called\nbranch chain amino acids,\nand amino acids, like leucine,\nwhich are important for\nmuscle protein synthesis.\nExplored whether or not emphasizing\nor skewing the protein\nintake toward early day\nor late day was better in\nterms of muscle hypertrophy.\nAnd they also looked at\nsome parameters of strength,\nlike grip strength.\nNow mice are nocturnal.\nSo, before you say wait,\nmice are nocturnal,\nhow did they look during the day?\nAnd it's completely,\nit doesn't apply because it's in mice.\nOf course they knew that.\nAnd they looked during\nthe mice's active phase\nof their circadian cycle,\nwhich corresponds to our day.\nAnd in humans, they looked\nat whether or not eating\nmost of one's protein early in the day,\nwas better than if the protein intake\nand the sprint chain amino acids\nwere placed later in the day.\nAnd yes, they had the mice\ndo resistance training.\nThey did that by emphasizing\noverload to one limb\nof the mouse.\nAnd that actually generates hypertrophy.\nIt's a form of resistance\ntraining in mice.\nSo, they don't have them weight training.\nThey weren't doing curls\nand dips and squats\nand things of that sort.\nThey were moving their own body weight,\nbut they skewed that\ndistribution of body weight\nby restricting a limb and\nforcing them to use one limb\nthat did indeed grow in response to that.\nAnd then in humans,\nthere was an exploration of grip strength.\nAnd then with resistance\ntraining that was also carried\nout through a peripheral study.\nBasically the takeaway from\nthis study was that mice\nand humans can utilize amino\nacids that are ingested early\nin the day,\nbetter than they can utilize\namino acids ingested later\nin the day in particular\ntoward muscle hypertrophy\nand growth or maintenance of muscle,\nwhich for those of you\nthat aren't interested\nin much muscle hypertrophy\nthat aren't trying\nto grow your muscles.\nI've talked before in the\nepisode on building strength\nand hypertrophy, that maintaining muscle,\nregardless of one's athletic prowess,\nregardless of one's age\nis extremely important\nbecause loss of skeletal muscle\nis one of the major causes of injury.\nAs we age.\nIt's one of the major causes,\nbelieve it or not, of cognitive\nand metabolic deficits\nas we age.\nSo, maintaining muscle is important.\nBuilding muscle might be\nimportant to some of you,\nbut what they found was ingesting\nprotein early in the day.\nAnd these amino acids early in the day,\nled to more muscle hypertrophy\nthan if the majority\nof amino acids and proteins\nwere ingested late in the day.\nSo, this translates to\nintermittent fasting,\nsuch that if you are interested\nin muscle hypertrophy,\nyou might, and I want to emphasize,\nmight consider making sure\nthat you're getting sufficient\nprotein intake early in the day.\nWhat sources of protein you use,\nis going to be highly individual.\nSome of you are meat eaters.\nSome of you don't eat red meat.\nSome of you eat chicken and fish and eggs.\nSome of you don't, some of you are vegans.\nIt has been shown that the\namino acid leucine is vital\nfor the cell growth process,\nincluding muscle growth,\nbecause of its relationship\nto the so-called mTOR pathway,\nmammalian target of rapamycin.\nWe can talk about that more if\nyou like in a future episode,\nthis means that if you're\nsomebody who wants to maintain\nor increase the amount of\nmuscle mass that you have,\ningesting a high protein\nmeal early in the day ought\nto be beneficial for that.\nDoes it mean that you\nshould not eat protein\nin the afternoon and evening?\nNo.\nI think a lot of people might've\nmisinterpreted this study\nand I don't want that to happen.\nThis is only pointing out the fact\nthat ingesting sufficient\nquality amino acids,\nincluding leucine, early in\nthe day can be beneficial\nfor maintenance and\ngrowth of muscle tissue.\nIt does not say that you\nshould avoid protein later\nin the day.\nNow for you intermittent\nfasters, this could be relevant.\nI, for instance,\nwith somebody who for a very\nlong time skipped breakfast,\nmy first meal of the day would\nbe in the early afternoon,\nmostly protein and salad,\nin my case, animal protein.\n'Cause that's in alignment with my values.\nThen in the evening I would eat pasta,\nvegetables, et cetera.\nI might have some protein,\nsome small piece of fish or\nchicken or something like that,\nbut I didn't really emphasize that.\nOn the basis of these results.\nI am experimenting with.\nI want to emphasize experimenting with,\nI haven't completely\ntossed out my old protocol,\nbut I'm experimenting with\neating proteins early in the day\nand eating lunch.\nAnd then dinner might be\nlight supper of some sort,\nbut not so much protein\nlater in the evening.\nAgain, if you want to eat six meals a day,\nyou want to eat round the clock.\nI'm not going to stop you.\nI'm not telling anybody what to do.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nnobody knows exactly how to\neat for one's particular goals.\nBut this study was really interesting,\nbecause it really did\nshow that we can utilize\nthe proteins that are\ningested early in the day,\nbetter than we can utilize\nthe proteins that are ingested\nlater in the day.\nAnd of course there will be\nfactors that can shift that.\nFor instance, if you work out very hard\nwith resistance training later in the day,\nresistance training is known\nto increase protein synthesis.\nSo, it stands to reason\nthat ingesting amino acids\nafter that training would be beneficial.\nHowever, in this study,\nit did not seem to matter when\nthe resistance training fell\nwithin the 24 hour schedule.\nThe morning ingestion\nor early day ingestion\nof amino acids seemed to be beneficial.\nHow early?\nBetween the hours of about 5:00 A.M.\nand 10:00 A.M. for humans.\nNow just a bit of mechanism\nto explain why this happens.\nSo, why would it be that\ningesting protein early in the day\nwould lead to more synthesis of muscle\nthan ingesting protein later in the day?\nAnd the reason it turns out is related\nto the circadian clock mechanism\nthat is present in all cells,\nincluding muscle cells.\nSo, muscles have fibers.\nI think most people are aware of that,\nthat your muscles are not\njust one big blob of tissue.\nA lot of these little\nfibers that contract.\nWithin those fibers, however,\nthere are cells with nuclei.\nThose nuclei contained DNA.\nDNA is transcribed into RNA.\nRNA is translated into proteins.\nThe DNA of your cells,\nincluding these muscle cells\nare under strong circadian regulation.\nEach one has a pattern of gene\nexpression that is different\nat different times\nduring the 24 hour cycle,\nthis is an unescapable reality\nof all cells in your body,\nright from your hair\ncells to your brain cells,\nto your retinal cells,\nto your toe on both feet.\nThese cells make a gene\ncalled, BMAL, BMAL, B-M-A-L\nis a clock gene.\nAnd the expression of\nthis clock gene varies\nacross the 24 hour cycle,\nand proteins that are downstream\nof this BMAL gene influence\nprotein synthesis.\nThe circadian regulation\nof this BMAL gene turns\nout to be vitally important\nfor this protein synthesis mechanism.\nHow do we know that?\nWell, in this particular study,\nbecause they had a mouse that lacked BMAL,\nthe gene was knocked out,\nthey had bunch of these mice.\nThey were able to explore\nwhether or not this early day\nfeeding effect was present or absent\nin these mice that lack the gene BMAL.\nAnd indeed it was absent.\nIn other words,\nthe effect of increased protein\nsynthesis early in the day\nwas eliminated in the\nabsence of the BMAL gene.\nSo, what this means is that\nwhen you wake up in the morning,\nassuming you're following\na standard schedule\nof being asleep at night\nand awake during the day,\nyour muscle cells are primed\nto incorporate amino acids\nand synthesize muscle,\nregardless of whether or\nnot you weight trained\nthe night before 8:00 P.M.,\nor you don't weight train at all,\nor you weight train afterwards or before.\nI said five to 10:00 P.M.\nis the sort of critical\nwindow for this increased\nprotein synthesis.\nAll this means is that if you\nare interested in maintaining\nor enhancing muscle tissue volume,\nthat you might want to\nconsider eating quality,\nprotein and amino acids early in the day,\nyou could train first.\nYou could train after,\nyou can not train at all.\nThat's entirely different discussion.\nWhat is quality protein,\nwell quality protein is\ngoing to be a protein\nthat includes most of the\nessential amino acids.\nAnd in particular leucine.\nNow, there's a lot of debate as to whether\nor not you can get all\nthe essential amino acids\nfrom a purely plant based diet\nor whether or not you need\nto ingest animal-based foods or not.\nThe term quality protein\nhas no strict scientific definition.\nSome people define quality\nprotein as a protein\nthat has a high essential\namino acid to caloric ratio.\nNow, what that means is,\na small piece of chicken\nor steak or eggs for instance,\nwill have many essential amino acids\nwith a low caloric content\nrelative to say beans\nor plant-based food that can also get\nyou essential amino acids,\nbut it requires more calories to access\nthose essential amino acids.\nNow that's that has many\nexceptions and nuances.\nAnd I for one, and perfectly\nrespectful of the folks\nthat just want to ingest\nplant-based foods in order to get\ntheir high quality protein.\nI think that actually can be done.\nOne has to be careful and\nthoughtful in their choices\nabout how to do that.\nSo, this really isn't about animal based\nversus non-animal based foods.\nThis is about getting quality\namino acids early in the day\nfrom whatever foods are in\nalignment with your particular\nvalues in your particular eating plan.\nSo, that's a lot of information,\nbut the key takeaways are\nevery cell in your muscles\nhas a clock gene.\nThe clock genes vary such\nthat protein synthesis\nis greater early in the day\nthan it is later in the day,\nsuch that in both mice and in humans,\ningestion of quality proteins\nearly in the day will be more\nso incorporated into muscle.\nThan the proteins that are\ningested late in the day.\nAnd of course there are the\ncaveats of if you're training\nhard late in the day,\nif you're adjusting your hormone status\nthrough whatever mechanism et cetera,\nprotein synthesis can also\nbe high later in the day.\nBut for most people it's\ngoing to taper off due\nto this circadian BMAL\ngene related mechanism.\nAgain, we will provide a link to the study\nand the other key takeaways\nwere that nobody knows.\nNobody can tell you what\nhealthy feeding windows are,\nwhat the best feeding windows are.\nThere's absolutely no\ninformation in that context,\nyou talk to 10 nutritionists\nor academics or trainers\nor individuals about\nwhat healthy eating is,\nand you are going to get\nvastly different answers.\nAnd that's one of the\nreasons why I believe\nthat the internet in\nparticular social media,\nare so filled with contradictory opinions,\nbut the calories in versus\ncalories burned formula,\nis that more or less holy\nfoundation of all things\nabout nutrition, eating and weight.\nAnd as we transition\ntoday into the discussion\nabout eating disorders,\nI'd like you to keep this in\nmind because for the treatment\nof eating disorders,\nit doesn't matter what psychological\nor early trauma based effects\nled to the eating disorder.\nIf the person isn't adjusting\ntheir feeding behavior\nin a way that is going to\nameliorate the symptoms\nof that disorder, which\nis ultimately the goal.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to\nemphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Belcampo,\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass fed\nand finished certified humane meats.\nI don't eat a lot of meat, but\nI eat meat about once a day.\nThat means a small piece of\nsteak or chicken, et cetera,\nand usually a salad.\nI usually do that for\nbreakfast or for lunch.\nAnd then in the evening\nI tend to follow a more\nor less vegetarian diet.\nI tend to eat pastas and\nvegetables and things of that sort.\nWell I don't eat a lot of meat.\nIt's important that the meat\nthat I eat be a very high\nquality and that I am certain\nthat the animals were raised\nand treated humanely up\nuntil the point of slaughter.\nBelcampo's animals, graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses, their\nentire lives resulting\nin meat that's higher in\nnutrients and healthy fats.\nIt also results in healthy happy cows.\nOften talk about how important\nomega-3 fatty acids are.\nThey've been shown to be\nimportant for regulating mood,\nfor the microbiome,\nfor restricting inflammation in the brain\nand elsewhere in the body.\nBelcampo's meats are known\nto be high in omega threes.\nAnd given that the meat is\ngrass fed and grass finished,\nthat combines all the\nfeatures of the nutrition\nand the animal wellbeing\nthat I want to see\nfor any meat that I ingest.\nIf you'd like to try Belcampo,\nfirst-time customers can get\n20% off by going to belcampo.com/huberman\nand using the code huberman@checkout,\nthat's belcampo.com/huberman for 20% off.\nYour first order.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app.\nThat's backed by 25 published studies\nand has over 600,000 five-star reviews.\nI've been meditating for a very long time.\nAlthough I admit I meditate on and off,\nmeaning I'll go a few weeks or\nmonths meditating regularly.\nAnd then I tend to stop.\nA few years ago, I got into\na regular meditation practice\nbecause I started using\nHeadspace meditation app.\nThe thing I really like\nabout their meditation app\nis it has meditations\nof different durations.\nSo, sometimes I'll just\nmeditate for three minutes\nor five minutes,\nor ideally I'm doing two\n20 minute sessions per day,\nbut I confess I don't always manage that,\nbut they have a ton of\ndifferent meditations\non the Headspace app that allow you\nto tailor your meditation practice\nto your particular schedule.\nAnd there are now a plethora\nof studies showing the benefits\nof a regular meditation practice.\nIf you want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/special offer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a free one month\ntrial with Headspace's full\nlibrary of meditations.\nYou get them all.\nThat's the best deal offer\nby Headspace right now.\nSo, again, if you're interested,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is a vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink,\nand it's one that I've\nbeen drinking since 2012.\nThe reason I started drinking\nAthletic Greens and the reason\nI still take Athletic Greens\nis that it really helps me\ncover all of my nutritional\nbasis with respect to vitamins\nand minerals and probiotics.\nAnd we now know that a\nhealthy gut microbiome\nis supported by probiotics.\nAnd for me,\nAthletic Greens is the best\nway to get those probiotics.\nI also ingest some fermented foods,\nbut by ingesting Athletic Greens,\nI'm certain to get all the things I need.\nAnd also, I just feel\nbetter when I drink it.\nI genuinely feel like I have more energy\nand I just feel better.\nAnd I happen to really\nlike the way it tastes.\nI mix mine with some water\nand some lemon juice.\nAnd in doing that, I'm certain\nto get all my nutritional\nbasis covered and the probiotics support\na healthy gut microbiome,\nwhich is important for mood,\nregulating inflammation and so on.\nIf you want to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll give you five free travel packs.\nIn addition to your Athletic Greens order,\nthose travel packs make it really easy\nto mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road,\nin the car, on the plane, et cetera.\nAnd they will give you a year supply\nof vitamin D3, K2,\nvitamin D3 and K2 have\nbeen shown to be important\nfor blood lipid profiles for\nmetabolism and a whole bunch\nof other metabolic and neural processes.\nSo, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel\npacks and the year supply\nof D3 and K2.\nSo, let's talk about eating disorders.\nAnd as we do that, I\nwant to emphasize again,\nthat nobody can really define\nwhat healthy eating is,\nwith a single protocol.\nHowever, there is some general agreement\nabout what unhealthy and\ndisordered eating is.\nThere are clear criteria\nin the psychiatric\nand psychological communities\nto define things like anorexia\nbulimia, binge eating disorder,\nall of which we will talk about,\nbut as we have that discussion,\nI want to emphasize that self-diagnosis\ncan be both a terrific, but\nalso a very precarious thing.\nWe talked about this a\nlittle bit in the episode\nabout depression, there's always\na temptation as one learns\nabout the symptomology\nof a given disorder.\nIt doesn't really matter\nwhat the disorder is,\nto ask the question.\nWell, do I have that?\nDoes so-and-so that I know have that, ah,\nI see this sort of behavior\nor that pattern of thinking.\nIn that individual, it's\ntempting to diagnose them\nand or ourselves as either having or not\nhaving a particular disorder.\nHowever, diagnoses really need\nto be carried out by people\nwho are trained in that particular field,\nand that have deep\nexpertise in recognizing\nthe symptomology, including some\nof the more subtle symptomology\nof eating disorders.\nSo, if any of the symptoms\nresonate with you,\nby way of you thinking\nthat you have this particular\ndisorder or someone that,\nyou know, has this disorder,\nI would take that seriously,\nbut I would take that information\nto a qualified healthcare\nprofessional that could diagnose\nor rule out any of these\npossible disorders.\nI say that not to protect us,\nbut to protect you, because\ninformation is valuable.\nAnd I do believe that\nknowledge of knowledge\ncan be very valuable\nin navigating any topic\nand improving our thoughts and\nbehaviors around that topic.\nBut one doesn't want to, or I should say,\none, shouldn't start to\nself-diagnose simply on the basis\nof information without running\nthat through the filter\nof a qualified professional.\nSo, what is an eating disorder?\nWell, we have to take a step back,\nand confess to the fact that\nevery society, every culture,\nevery family, and every individual\nhas a different relationship to food,\neating disorders, however,\nhave particular criteria\nthat allow us to define them and to think\nabout different modes of treatment.\nAs it relates to the particular\nsymptoms and particular,\nthe psychological and biological symptoms\nof those disorders.\nNow that's a mouthful, no pun intended.\nWhat are the major eating disorders?\nAnorexia nervosa, most commonly\nreferred to as anorexia\nis perhaps the most prevalent\nand the most dangerous\nof all eating disorders.\nIn fact, anorexia is the most\ndangerous psychiatric disorder\nof all, even more than depression.\nThe probability of death\nfor untreated anorexia\nis very high, and sadly the prevalence\nof anorexia is very high.\nSo, what is anorexia\nand how prevalent is it?\nAnorexia, if you look\nit up online or you talk\nto a qualified professional,\nis essentially a failure\nto eat enough, to\nmaintain a healthy weight.\nYou can see all sorts of very\ntroubling symptoms of somebody\nwho's been anorexic for\nsome period of time,\na general loss of muscle mass\nbecause they're ingesting\nfewer calories than they burn.\nMuscle is very metabolically active.\nThey tend to lose a lot of muscle mass.\nThey will have a low heart rate.\nThis is the body and brain's\nattempt to lower energy output.\nThey will have low blood pressure.\nThey'll sometimes have\nsymptoms like fainting.\nThey will have sometimes\neven hair growth on the face,\nsomething called lanugo,\nwhich is essentially the body's attempt\nto insulate the body because\nof loss of body heat.\nWhen you're that thin.\nLoss of bone density,\nosteoporosis, loss of\nperiods in girls and women,\nand all sorts of disrupted\ngut and immune functions.\nSo, there are just tons\nof terrible symptoms\nof anorexia that really\nplaced the anorexic\ninto a very risky state,\nwhich is why mortality\nfrom anorexia gone\nuntreated is extremely high.\nNow, one of the\nmisconceptions about anorexia,\nis that it stems from an\noveremphasis on perfectionism,\nor that because of all\nthe images in social media\nand in advertising of\nextremely thin and fit\nor muscular people that\nindividuals are looking\nat themselves and comparing\nthemselves to those images\nand thinking that they don't match up\nand developing anorexia,\nthat turns out to not be the case.\nIf you look at the prevalence\nor the rates of anorexia,\nin the last 10 years or 20 years,\nand you compare that to when\nanorexia was first identified,\nwhich was in the 1600s,\nand perhaps even earlier,\nwhat you find is that rates\nof anorexia are not going up.\nSo, this idea that the images\nthat we're being bombarded\nwith are causing anorexia\ndoesn't seem to be true.\nNow, that is not to say that the images\nthat we in particular young\npeople are being bombarded\nwith are healthy for the\npsychological state of mind.\nBut classically define anorexia\nhas existed at essentially\nthe same prevalence for the last 100, 200,\n300 and 400 years,\nwhich is incredible and really\nspeaks to the likelihood\nthat there's a strong\nbiological contribution\nto what we call anorexia nervosa.\nAnorexia nervosa is extremely common.\nIt's anywhere from one to 2% of women.\nAnd the typical onset is in\nadolescence close to puberty,\nbut it can show up later in life as well.\nIn fact, the identification\nand diagnosis of anorexia tends\nto be in the early '20s.\nBut if you look back at the\nhistory of those individuals,\nthere were typically signs\nof anorexia that back\ninto their early teens.\nOr maybe even before that.\nNow, of course, men can\nbe anorexic as well,\nbut anorexia nervosa does seem\nto occur at 10 times the rate\nin women and young girls,\nthan it does in men and young boys.\nSo, while there does seem to be more\nof a prevalence of anorexia\nin boys and young men,\nthese days, that's probably\ndue to better diagnosis\nand detection than it is to some sort\nof societal shift related\nto imagery, et cetera.\nLater, we will talk about body dysmorphia\nand some of the images\nthat are present in media\nand social media and how those\nare impacting other forms\nof eating disorders.\nBut when you look at anorexia nervosa,\nthis failure to maintain weight,\neven to healthy levels\nand often drops in weight\nthat are very dangerous or even deadly,\nthat has existed for a very long time,\nand seems to be somewhat\nhardwired into the biology\nof individuals that suffer from it.\nNow, when I say hard wired,\nthat doesn't mean that it\ncan't be treated or cured,\nand indeed it can.\nBulimia which is defined as\nbinge eating or overeating.\nLet me explain what that is.\nBinge eating is consuming\nvast amounts of calories\nin a short period of time.\nOvereating can be ingesting\nmore calories than one needs,\nbut over an extended period of time,\nboth can exist of course, but\nbulimia is also very common.\nIt's more common in young girls\nand in women that it is\nin young boys and in men,\nbut it is present in both sexes.\nBulimia and rates of\nbulimia might be increasing.\nThat's sort of an interesting finding.\nIt's not quite clear\nwhether or not it's existed\nin its same form for a long period of time\nor within other new forms that\nare evolving or showing up,\nwe're going to drill into bulimia\nand what it actually is\nand what it represents.\nBut one thing I want to be clear about,\njust as the perfectionist\nmindset has been associated\nwith anorexia, and it turns\nout that's not the case.\nIt can be, but it's not always\nassociated with anorexia.\nThere was the idea that\nbulimia is associated\nwith early trauma in childhood,\nin particular sexual trauma.\nAnd while that can be the case,\nthere's no direct\ncorrelation between the two.\nNow, obviously psychological\nphenomena and trauma\ncan have a profound impact on the way\nthat the brain wires up and the way\nthat people approach food\nand other types of behaviors.\nBut the sort of classic\nidea was that all anorexics\nare perfectionists, they\nwant to perform well.\nIt's all about control and autonomy.\nAnd bulimics are kind of\ndysregulated and acting\nout against some early sexual trauma,\nthose stereotypes of the\npsychological framework\nof anorexics and\nbulimics, doesn't hold up.\nWhen you look at the data, many,\nmany meta analysis have been done.\nIt just simply is not the case.\nAnd in both instances,\nboth anorexia and bulimia,\nthere are clear biological underpinnings,\nto what's driving the\nunder-eating or the overeating.\nSo, we're going to talk about\nthe biology of under eating\nand overeating and\nappropriate levels of eating.\nAnd by doing that,\nwe will start to identify\nsome of the mechanisms\nthat serve as entry\npoints for the treatment\nof both anorexia and bulimia.\nAnd as some of you are probably aware,\nanorexia and bulimia can be comorbid,\nthey can exist with one another.\nThere are anorexics who\nwill binge and then purge\nin order to maintain that\nunhealthily low weight.\nThere are bulimics\nwho fit the psychological\ncriteria of anorexia.\nAnd so there's a lot of overlap\nbetween those two categories.\nNow let's talk about the\ncategorization for a second and why\nthe categorization has led to now a bunch\nof other eating disorders as defined\nby the psychiatric community.\nOne of the classic symptoms of anorexia\nis a loss of menstrual\ncycles, loss of periods.\nAnd the reason for that is when\nthe body is undernourished,\nthe body fat stores,\nsend signals to the brain\nto inform that the body is undernourished,\nor they turn off the\nsignals that say, look,\nthere are enough body fat cells out here\nto support healthy metabolism.\nAnd therefore let's shut down ovulation,\nliterally signal sent\nfrom the fat and muscle\nto the brain and the brain,\nthe hypothalamus and pituitary\nwill send signals down\nto the ovaries,\nor they will turn off the\nsignals heading to the ovaries\nto deploy eggs,\nto maturation of eggs in\nthe follicle, et cetera.\nSo, there are instances in\nwhich people have anorexia\nor have bulimia,\nbut are still maintaining\nhealthy menstrual cycles\nor at least menstrual cycles.\nAnd that has led to a whole\nset of other categorizations\nof eating disorders, like\nbinge eating disorder,\nwhere there tends to\nbe a lot of overeating,\nbut not the purging or\ncategorizations of anorexia,\nin which people are under feeding,\nbut they are not losing their periods.\nAnd so these have a number of\ndifferent names and acronyms.\nSome of them include things like, EDNOS,\nEDNOS is eating disorder,\nnot otherwise specified.\nSo, that's a sub categorization or OSFEDs.\nSo, OSFEDs is or specified\nfeeding or eating disorder.\nSo, right now,\nif you were to look\nonline or you're looking\nto the psychiatric and\npsychological textbooks,\nwhat you would find is that\nthere's a huge constellation\nof eating disorders today.\nWe're mainly going to talk about anorexia,\nbulimia, binge eating\ndisorder and body dysmorphia.\nYou can even find eating\ndisorders like pica,\nwhere people actually ingest\nthings like dirt or rocks\nor metal because they\nhave a genuine appetite\nfor those things.\nI certainly do not recommend sampling any\nof those non food items.\nAs foods, is incredibly dangerous.\nPeople often poisoned themselves.\nThey often can cause structural blockages\nsome people have died from\nthose sorts of things.\nBut nonetheless, there\nare aspects of our brain\nand biology that when disrupted can lead\nto very bizarre types of eating behavior,\nsometimes pica is caused by\nmalnutrition, but not always.\nAnd so today we're going to focus\non the most prevalent eating disorders,\nbut we are going to build\nup toward that understanding\nby looking at what healthy\nmetabolism and eating\nand satiety and hunger looks like.\nBecause one, I realized that not everyone\nout there has an eating disorder.\nAnd two, I want people to\nunderstand this relationship\nbetween how they think,\nthe decisions they take\nabout what they eat\nand how the body and the\nbrain at subconscious levels\nare driving some of these\nbehaviors healthy or otherwise.\nBecause I do think that\nit can lead us to a better\nunderstanding of what healthy\neating is for most of us,\nand to increase compassion and hopefully\neven increased improvement in\ntreatment of eating disorders\nfor those that are suffering from them.\nSo, what is hunger and what is satiety?\nSatiety, of course being sated\nor feeling like we've had enough food.\nI want to remind people\nof the basic mechanisms\nby which the brain and body communicate.\nThis is vitally important,\nnot just for this discussion,\nbut for any discussion, about\nhow we think, how we behave,\nhow we feel, the body is\ncommunicating two types\nof information to the\nbrain on a regular basis,\nbut in particular around\nfeeding, and those two types\nof information are mechanical information,\nand chemical information.\nWhat do I mean by mechanical information?\nWell, if you take a deep breath, oh,\nand you hold your breath,\nwhat you'll find is that\nyou can hold your breath\na lot longer than if\nyou exhale all your air\nand you hold your breath with lungs empty.\nAnd the reason is not because\nwhen your lungs are full,\nyou have enough oxygen\nand therefore you can hold your breath.\nIt's because when your lungs are full,\na particular class of\nneurons called baroreceptors,\nsend information to the brain and say,\nthere's pressure in the lungs.\nAnd that means that there's\nprobably oxygen in here.\nAnd so the trigger to breathe\nis actually suppressed,\nwhen your lungs are empty.\nEven if you have plenty\nof oxygen in your system,\nthose baroreceptors send a\ndifferent signal to the brain,\nwhich is there's no oxygen in\nhere and you should breathe.\nAnd so the impulse to\nbreathe comes earlier.\nLikewise, when your stomach is full,\nit sends signals to your\nbrain that are purely based\non this mechanical fullness,\nhas nothing to do with\nnutrients, that says I'm full.\nAnd therefore don't be as hungry.\nDon't motivate to find or ingest food.\nWhereas when our gut is empty,\neven if we have plenty of nutrients\nor plenty of body fat stores,\nwe tend to focus on food a bit more.\nSo, volume and mechanical\ninfluences have a profound effect\non how we think.\nAnd what consider doing or not doing,\nlikewise chemical effects.\nWhen we ingest food,\nour so-called blood sugar or\nblood glucose levels go up.\nThat information is signaled to the brain\nvia neuronal pathways\nand hormonal pathways.\nAnd in particular, there\nare neurons within our gut,\nthat signal to areas of our\nbrain stem that are involved\nin satiety in our sense of having enough\nthat there's food in our system.\nSo, that's chemical information.\nSo, how our hunger and\nfeeding and satiety regulated\nby way of mechanical\nand chemical signaling.\nYou have, I have,\nwe all have neurons in our\nhypothalamus that trigger eating\nand neurons that trigger\ncessation or stopping of eating.\nWe have an accelerator on\neating and we have a break.\nAnd I covered all of this in\na lot of detail in the episode\non feeding and metabolism and hunger.\nSo, if you want a lot more\ndetail, see that episode,\nbut right now,\nI'm just going to give you the top contour\nof how all that works.\nYour hypothalamus is an\narea of your forebrain,\nwhich tells you it's in the front,\nbut it's at the base of your\nforebrain sits more or less\nabove the roof of your mouth.\nThe hypothalamus contains\nlots of different kinds\nof neurons, including neurons\nthat stimulate sexual activity\nand desire, regulate your body temperature\nand control appetite and\nceasing of eating and appetite.\nThere are two types of neurons\nwithin a particular area\nof your hypothalamus\nthat are relevant here.\nThere are the so-called\nPOMC neurons, okay?\nPro-opiomelanocortin neurons\nthat tend to act as more\nof a break on appetite,\nby way of another hormone\ncalled melanocytes stimulating hormone.\nAnd not so incidentally\nwhen you're getting\na lot of sunlight and you're\nviewing a lot of sunlight,\nthat system is ramped up.\nThis is why appetite is\nlower in the summer months\nthan it is in the winter months.\nThis is true in animals.\nAnd this is true in humans.\nAnd you have a class of neurons\ncalled the AgRP neurons.\nThe AgRP neurons are the\nones that stimulate feeding,\nand they create a sort of\nanxiety or excitement about food,\ncan be positive anxiety, or\nit can be negative anxiety.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if you ever seen kids\nheading in to get ice cream,\nthey're absolutely excited.\nYou see people getting raised,\nsit down and eat a big meal.\nThey're excited to eat.\nSometimes that's due to social factors,\nbut they have an increase\nin overall levels\nof autonomic arousal.\nAnd depending on the context,\nthey can feel excited or anxious,\nbut it is a ramping up of energy.\nThese AgRP neurons are what caused that,\nin fact so much so that if you eliminate\nor kill these neurons, which has been done\nin experimental mouse\nmodels in the laboratory,\nbut also there are\nhumans that have lesions\nor neurotoxic effects\non these AgRP neurons.\nAnd what you find is that\nthey don't want to eat.\nThey essentially become anorexic,\nmeaning they don't want to ingest food.\nThey have no appetite for food whatsoever.\nNow that's not exactly what anorexia is,\nbut these AgRP neurons\nare like an accelerator\non wanting to eat.\nWhereas if you stimulate\nthese AgRP neurons\nor in humans that have\nsay a small tumor near\nthese AgRP neurons,\nthey become hyperphagic.\nThey will eat to the point of bursting,\nboth animals and humans\nthat have elevated levels\nof these AgRP neurons are anxious.\nThey want to eat,\nand they will ingest food to\nthe point where they override\nthose mechanical and\nchemical signals in the body.\nAnd I know it sounds\nhorrible, and it is horrible.\nThey will eat until the\npoint that they burst.\nNow, there are signals\ncoming back from the body\nto inform the brain about presence\nof different levels of nutrients.\nAnd that generally comes\nfrom three sources.\nFirst of all, is body fat.\nThe more body fat we have,\nthe more we secrete a hormone\ncalled leptin, L-E-P-T-I-N,\nleptin from body fat,\nleptin goes to the brain\nand suppresses appetite.\nThis is a body to brain signaling\nmechanism that says, look,\nI've had enough,\nnot incidentally, leptin\nsignaling is disrupted\nin people that have bulimia and obesity\nand certain forms of\nbinge eating disorder.\nSo, that system has disrupted\nthey have had enough signal\nor there's enough body fat\nhere such that you don't need\nto eat more right here,\nI'm sort of in the voice\nof the body fat, trying to\ntalk to the brain, that signal,\nthat dialogue is mixed up or messed up.\nIn some cases it's absent entirely.\nSo, the body fat is signaling to the brain\nabout how much reserve you have.\nIt's sort of like a\nsavings account for energy,\n'cause that's what body fat is.\nYou've got lipids in there\nand through lipolysis,\nthat can be metabolized.\nIf you're interested in that process,\nboth how to increase it.\nAnd just generally how it works.\nYou can see the episode on\nthe science of fat loss.\nThe body fat is doing something\nelse really interesting\nthat relates to anorexia,\nwhen they're sufficient levels of body fat\nand leptin circulating in the blood.\nAnd that leptin signal gets to the brain,\nthe hypothalamus and the pituitary gland\nregister that signal.\nAnd in a completely subconscious way,\ntrigger the deployment of eggs\nin females and the production\nof sperm in males.\nSo, when body fat stores are very low,\nthe reason why periods shut\noff or sperm production\nis reduced or even shut off\nis because there's not enough\nleptin getting to the\nhypothalamus and to the pituitary.\nAnd they shut off the\nsignals, the hormones,\nthings like\ngonadotropin-releasing hormone,\nluteinizing hormone,\nfollicle-stimulating hormone,\nall these hormones.\nSo, you don't have to remember the names\nof if you don't want to\nthat travel to the ovary\nor to the testes and\ncause the ovary and testes\nto ovulate or to produce more sperm.\nSo, the reason why anorexic\nstopped having periods,\nwhile they stopped cycling,\nis because there isn't sufficient\nleptin in the bloodstream.\nNow there have been attempts\nto give leptin to anorexics\nbecause leptin has been\nsequenced and the peptide\nhas been synthesized.\nAnd so you can inject leptin into people.\nThere are studies where they've done that,\nwhen that happens, it\ndoes not tend to alleviate\nthe anorexia, does not cause\npeople to start eating again.\nAnd that actually makes sense\nbecause leptin is also a way\nof shutting off the hunger signals saying,\nit's the body fats way of saying, hey,\nthere's a lot of body fat here,\nor there is sufficient body fat.\nThere doesn't even have\nto be a lot, but it has,\nin some cases been shown\nto rescue the menstrual,\ncycling in some anorexics, okay?\nSo, body fat is signaling to the brain.\nThe gut is signaling to the brain.\nThere are neurons in your gut\nthat are primarily responding\nto meaning they fire electrical signals.\nWhen there are sufficient\nfatty acids coming\nfrom fats you ingest, amino acids coming\nfrom proteins you ingest and sugars coming\nfrom carbohydrates and sugars.\nThings like fructose, glucose, et cetera.\nThose signals are being sent\nfrom the fat and from the gut\nup to the brain.\nAnd therefore your body\nhas multiple signals\nof directing you toward\neating more or eating less.\nSo, you've got two categories of neurons.\nOne that acts as an accelerator,\nthe AgRP neuron saying,\neat, eat, and get you excited to eat.\nAnd then you have a category of neurons.\nThe POMC neurons that\nare suppressing hunger.\nThey're acting like a break,\nand the body is informing\nthe brain all the time about the status\nof the body and whether or\nnot it needs more food or not.\nSo, you might ask why is it\nthat people who are overweight\nand have a lot of body fat,\nwhy they would continue to eat a lot,\nwell past a certain\nthreshold of body fat that's\nwhen you start getting\ninto these so-called metabolic disorders,\nwhere blood glucose\nmetabolism is disrupted,\nleptin signaling is disrupted\nand there are all sorts\nof changes on both the\nbrain side and the body end\nof things, such that they're hungry,\ndespite the fact that the body has plenty\nof energy on reserve.\nOkay, that I think is\nsufficient to explain the basics\nof hunger and satiety are kind\nof a biological mechanism.\nAnd the important thing again,\nto remember is that they're\nmechanical and chemical signals\nthat come from fullness\nor absence of fullness\nthat come in the presence\nof glucose in the blood\nor the absence of glucose in the blood.\nWhen you haven't eaten for a long time,\nglucagon levels go up, for instance,\nGLP1 levels go up and those will drive you\nto seek out food and want food.\nAnd then there are the signals\nthat are coming from body fat\nand from neurons in the gut.\nSo, there's a lot of convergence,\nin a lot of pathways.\nI don't offer you all those\npathways to confuse you.\nI offer you those pathways\nto clarify the extent\nto which something as simple\nas eating or the decision\nto not eat is complicated.\nWe've perhaps heard,\nor I've certainly heard\nthat, oh, you know,\nit takes about 20 minutes\nfor satiety to set in,\nso you should eat slowly that\nyou won't realize that you're\nfull until about 20 minutes.\nThat's actually not true.\nI don't know where that got started,\nbut we should probably\nall chew our food better\nand eat more slowly,\nbe more mindful of what\nwe're eating, et cetera.\nSo, in anticipation of this episode,\nI consulted extensively with a colleague\nof mine at Stanford,\nwho sadly for us is going off\nto University of Pennsylvania.\nSo, our losses University\nof Pennsylvania's win.\nHis name is Dr. Casey Halpern.\nHe's a MD, Medical\nDoctor and Neurosurgeon,\nand a PhD who studies\nbinge-eating disorder\nand other types of eating\ndisorders and how they arise\nin the brain.\nAnd he's developed some\nreally pioneering treatments for them.\nWe'll talk more about his\nwork a little bit later\nin the episode, but we\ngot to the discussion\nof why a body that has\nsufficient energy levels\nwould desire to eat more at all.\nAnd this is not just the case\nfor binge eating disorder\nfor bulimia, but why\nthat would be the case.\nYou know, this is primitive biology\nthat evolved over many tens.\nIf not hundreds of thousands\nof years, you see it in mice,\nyou see it in humans,\nvery similar types of\npathways and effects.\nHow is it that human\nbeings who have plenty\nof fat on reserve and plenty of glycogen\nin their liver, et cetera.\nIn other words, plenty of\nenergy, why they would be hungry,\nwhy they would eat at all.\nIt seems like that just shouldn't happen.\nAnd he had a very important,\nand I think clear and intuitive way\nof framing up all this stuff around eating\nand motivated behaviors\nand how they can go awry,\nnot just in eating\ndisorders, but in all of us.\nBasically what he said was,\nfrom an evolutionary standpoint,\nit makes sense that we should\neat as often as we can,\nas much as we can, and as fast as we can.\nWell, that sounds crazy.\nI've was told to eat not\ntoo often, not too much,\nand to eat slowly and chew my food.\nBut as Dr. Halpern pointed out,\nthere are circuits in the\nbrain to reward eating\noften eating fast and\ncramming as much food\ninto you as possible.\nBecause from a purely\nevolutionary standpoint,\nfood was scarce, and\nseeking food was dangerous,\nwhether or not it was from\nanimal sources or not.\nAnd it's always been competitive,\nfor those of you that grew\nup in families with a lot of siblings.\nThis may resonate with you.\nI just one sibling,\nwe were competitive about certain things,\nbut typically not competitive about food,\nbut I had friends that\nhad a lot of siblings.\nIt was really interesting to\nsee how food was served up\nand how it was taken in those households.\nIt was like food would hit\nthe table and it was just\nan absolute war for\nportions and who got what\nand how much and who got\na slightly bigger piece\nof cake, et cetera,\nturned out to be a frequent\nhappening in these meals\nand that these birthday parties,\nwhereas the only children\nperhaps were used\nto having more food presented\nto them without having\nto compete with other\nmembers of the species.\nEvery animal, including\nhumans has a hardwired circuit\nthat we were born with that pays attention\nto how much food is available,\nhow much we are getting now\nand how much we are likely\nto get in the future.\nAnd without going down the rabbit hole\nof arcuate nucleus\nbiology, in two sentences,\nyou have a hypothalamic area\ncalled the arcuate nucleus.\nIt's a fascinating area.\nIt's actually the area that houses,\nthese PMOC neurons and\nthese other types of neurons\nthat regulate hunger and satiety.\nAnd these neurons\nin the arcuate nucleus\nstart getting active.\nWhen we see food and think about food,\nthey drive hunger, and they drive hunger\nin a way that's responsive\nto what the food looks like,\nwhat it smells like,\nbut also our prior history of\ninteractions with that food.\nAnd it takes into account social context,\nwhether or not we are going\nto get the whole pizza\nto ourselves or whether or not\nthere are going to be others\nthat we are going to have to compete with.\nSo, there are a lot of signals\nthat this arcuate nucleus\nin your brain are paying attention to.\nSo, Dr. Halpern pointed\nout that you actually\nhave an accelerator that\nincreases your level of awareness\nand anxiety and sort\nof constricts your field of\nview and all your senses.\nAnytime you interact\nwith food and is driving\na primitive reflex to ingest\nas much food as you can,\nas quickly as you can,\nand then move on from there,\nand presumably to do the same elsewhere.\nSo, that changed the way that\nI think about eating behavior\nand eating disorders.\nIn fact, we could think about\neating disorders like bulimia\nas an unmasking of that mechanism\nwithout the so-called top-down control,\nwithout the mechanisms that we\nuse to regulate our behavior.\nAnd indeed bulimia and\nbinge-eating disorder\nare closely associated with impulsivity\nand with impulsive\nbehaviors of other kinds,\nsomething that we also will discuss more.\nWhat's the pathway?\nHow does this work?\nWhat is Dr. Halpern and his\ncolleagues doing in order\nto try and treat things\nlike binge eating disorder?\nWell, you can frame all of behavior,\ngood decision making\nand bad decision-making.\nIn a pretty simple box diagram model.\nAnd I realized that many of\nyou are listening to this,\nnot watching this.\nThere is no diagram to look at.\nI'll just explain it so\nthat you can conceptualize\nit in your mind.\nWe have knowledge of what we\nshould do, in one box, okay?\nWe should eat that.\nWe shouldn't eat that.\nWe should wait for dinner.\nWe shouldn't wait for dinner.\nAnd then we have what we\nactually do in another box, okay?\nNow this is true for all behaviors,\nwe should say something or\nwe want to say something,\nbut we don't, we shouldn't say\nsomething, but we do anyway.\nThat's the knowledge that\nkind of looping in your head.\nI should do my homework.\nI should go for a run.\nI shouldn't do this right now.\nI shouldn't be on social media,\nall those kinds of shoulds and shouldn'ts\nthat are circulating your head.\nThat's one box.\nThen there's what you actually do.\nThe behavior, whether or not\nyou suppress the behavior,\nyou turn off your phone and\nyou go read a book or you go\nto sleep or whether or\nnot you stay up all night,\nor you stay up for another\nhour, even five minutes.\nIn between those two boxes\nare two intervening forces.\nAnd those intervening forces\nare critically important.\nThose intervening forces\nare homeostatic processes,\ncalled by some processes, same thing,\nhomeostatic processes,\nthat regulate the balance\nof different systems in\nyour body, hot and cold,\nawake or asleep, dopamine and\nthe desire to pursue things,\nserotonin and the desire\nto just relax and chill.\nSo, homeostatic processes\nand reward systems.\nAnd as we now move into\ndiscussion about anorexia,\nand bulimia specifically,\nwhat you'll see is that\nanorexia and bulimia\nare not a breaking of the\nmindset of what one should do\nor shouldn't do.\nIt's a disruption of these\nhomeostatic and reward processes,\nsuch that decision-making\nis completely disrupted.\nAnd in many cases is not available\nto the anorexic or bulimic.\nNow, I don't want to be abstract here.\nWhat I'm saying is that the\nperson who starves themselves\nto the point where they\nmight die and in some cases,\nsadly do die.\nThey can know perfectly well\nthat their behavior is leading\nto bad outcomes and possibly even death.\nAnd yet they are not\nable to intervene unless\nthey get particular clinical help,\nbecause the homeostatic processes,\nthe signals from the body\nand brain that say, you need food.\nThose aren't registering in the same way\nthat they are for other individuals.\nand for the bulimic or\nthe person that suffers\nfrom binge eating disorder.\nThey don't necessarily\nwant to eat that food.\nThey simply cannot help it.\nIt's like a reflex for them,\nbecause the homeostatic processes\nand the reward processes\nassociated with food,\nare such that they can't intervene\nbetween the should do X, Y, or Z,\nor shouldn't do X, Y, or Z.\nAnd what their actual behavior is.\nNow, this isn't just a biological\nmechanistic explanation\nfor what could have been\nsummarized in two sentences.\nWhat this is,\nis a roadmap of where interventions\ncan really make a difference.\nSo, as we talk about different\ndrug based interventions\nor behavioral interventions\nor social interventions,\nI'd like you to think\nabout whether or not those\ninterventions are breaking into,\nor tapping into this box of the thinking,\nthe sort of pattern of\nthinking around food,\nwhether or not it's the behavior,\nthe actual ingestion or\nthe restriction of food,\nor whether or not it's tapping\ninto the homeostatic process,\nthe balance of energy systems\nand kind of getting enough,\nbut not too much, or it's\ntapping into the reward system.\nAnd just as a little teaser\nof where we're headed,\nwhat you'll find based on the\ndata clinical data experiments\ndone very carefully and very\nwell by excellent groups.\nWhat you'll find is the\nanorexics have a sort\nof switch that's been flipped,\nsuch that their decision-making\nis actually pretty darn good.\nIt might even be better\nthan yours in terms\nof evaluating food, nutritional content,\nbut their habits are disrupted.\nSo, they're not even\nconsciously aware of the fact\nthat they're making terrible.\nAnd in some cases, very\ndangerous food choices,\nand turns out that habits.\nAnd the way that we build and\nbreak and rebuild new habits\nis one of the most effective\ntreatments for anorexia.\nSo, now let's talk about anorexia,\nthis failure to consume enough energy,\nsuch that the individuals\nat risk of death,\nand if not death, then\nsevere metabolic disorders,\nlack of bone density, et cetera.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nanorexia and things that\nalmost certainly were,\nand are anorexia have\nbeen described as early\nas the 1600s.\nAnd maybe even earlier,\nthere are some records from the saints,\nfrom the 1400s of people\nthat refuse to ingest food.\nAnother common myth is that\nanorexia is only the sort\nof thing that you see in rich societies.\nThese are spoiled\nchildren with so much food\nthat they decide they're\nonly going to focus\non how slim they are,\nhow they look in bathing\nsuits, et cetera, not true.\nA careful analysis through\nmedical epidemiology has shown\nthat you find anorexia even in cultures\nand societies where food is scarce.\nSo, that really speaks\nto biological mechanism.\nNow it's hard to unveil in\nsocieties where food is scarce,\nbecause a lot of people\nare starving and hungry,\nbut there are individuals that\nchoose still to avoid food\nand seem to have some sort of\nreward mechanism that rewards\nthem, where makes them feel\nbetter if they don't eat,\ndespite the fact that their body\nis severely depleted of nutrients.\nSo, that's very interesting\nand points again\nto some disruption in\nsome biological mechanism.\nNow, I want to make sure\nthat I'm emphasizing\nthat I'm not in favor of people,\nin particular young children, adolescents,\nand teenagers being bombarded\nwith unrealistic imagery about bodies.\nBut the idea that that's the cause of,\nor is amplifying anorexia,\nthe data just don't seem\nto support that, anorexia\nin its classic sense,\nrequires that there be an endocrine,\nmeaning a hormonal disruption,\nmenstrual abnormalities,\nlack of sperm production,\nor low testosterone in\nmales, in order to meet\nthe classification for anorexia.\nBut as I mentioned earlier,\nthere are now nuanced and new\nclassifications of anorexia\nthat even for individuals\nthat still menstruate\nor that maintain a sperm\nproduction anorexia,\ncan still be considered\na clinically diagnosable disorder.\nNow, typically anorexia\nstarts in adolescence,\nright around puberty.\nLet's take a look at what puberty is.\nPuberty at a very broad\nlevel is the most significant\nand dramatic developmental step.\nAnyone goes through in their lifespan.\nThe body changes, the\nbrain changes, perceptions,\nchange, one's own self\nperception, changes.\nAnd most of those changes are\ndriven by changes in circuitry\nwithin the hypothalamus.\nSo, neurons that are\ncontrolling the production\nof the so-called sex steroid hormones,\nthings like testosterone,\nestrogen, and related\nhormones, prolactin, et cetera.\nThose are all changing\nat very rapid rates.\nAnorexia tends to show up\naround this time in a subset\nof individuals who on the\nface of it seem to find food,\naversive, now the purely\npsychological theory\nof this is that they are\nfighting for autonomy.\nThey want control.\nPuberty is also a time in\nwhich children and parents\nare in a tug of war over control.\nYou were once a small child\nbeing told when to go to bed\nsent to your room.\nNow you're a child that\ncan talk back and say,\nI don't want to, or I refuse to.\nAnd that happens a lot\nin various households,\nas I'm sure you're familiar with.\nAdolescence and puberty\nis also when girls start\nmenstruating typically,\nor boys develop deeper voice,\nthey start producing sperm, et cetera.\nSo, there are a lot of bodily changes\nthat also drive perceptual\nchanges and perceptual changes\nthat drive bodily changes.\nAnd it is a dramatic\nshift for a young girl\nor boy that doesn't nourish\nthemselves sufficiently.\nDuring that period,\nthere are a number of\ndownstream negative effects.\nI'll list out some of them,\nthese are just a subset of\nthe effects, hypogonadism.\nThat's the lack of sperm production\nor healthy egg production.\nThere is amenorrhea,\nwhich is the lack of\nmenstrual cycling, okay?\nSo, a failure to have a menstrual cycle.\nReduced insulin secretion,\ninsulin is this hormone\nthat's released in order\nto help shuttle glucose\ninto various tissues\nfor energy utilization.\nThat's down because energy\nlevels are down so much.\nOne of the symptoms that's\na little more cryptic,\nand that has actually\ninteresting implications\nfor sake of the cholesterol\nhypothesis is that anorexics\nwho ingest very little\nfood often have cosmically\nhigh levels of cholesterol, including LDL,\nlow density, lipoprotein cholesterol.\nYou say, well, how could that possibly be?\nWe were all told and continue to be told\nfrom many sources that\ningestion of dietary cholesterol\nis what drives high levels\nof bodily cholesterol.\nCholesterol is manufactured\nby the liver and in anorexics\nwho consume very little food.\nThey often have cosmically\nhigh levels of cholesterol,\nwhich is one of the kind of wrinkles\nin the so-called dietary\ncholesterol hypothesis\nthat all of our cholesterol\nthat we see on a blood panel\nis due to what we eat.\nBut the explanation for it\nis that under conditions\nwhere there's not sufficient cholesterol\nto synthesize the sex steroid hormones,\nthings like testosterone and estrogen,\nwhich are required in\nboth males and females,\nthose are made from\ncholesterol that the body,\nthe liver will start\ngenerating its own cholesterol\nwill often overshoot the\nmark to a dramatic degree.\nSo, the blood lipid profiles and anorexics\nare often very unhealthy despite the fact\nthat they're eating very little food.\nIn addition, they tend\nto have elevated levels\nof things like vasopressin,\nwhich are hormones that\nregulate body temperature\nand salt and blood volume.\nThey tend to have low blood pressure.\nThey can pass out.\nI mentioned some of the\nother symptoms earlier.\nIn other words, there are a huge number\nof terrible things happening.\nThyroid levels are down.\nHeart rates are down, if\nI'm painting a very bleak\npicture here is indeed a bleak picture.\nSo, we have to ask\nourselves what can be done\nfor the anorexic, right?\nLet's say it's a failure\nof the AgRP neurons\nto stimulate appetite and feeding.\nLet's say it's too much\nanxiety around food.\nLet's say it's because of\nthe way that food restriction\nwas used for reward in\nthe household, right?\nI'm making this up,\nbut you can imagine a\nhypothetical scenario\nwhere let's just say the mother\nof a particular individual\nis very vocal about her avoidance of food.\nWe've seen this before, right?\nYou've probably seen\nsomebody who loves to cook\nand prepare food, but then sits down\nand doesn't seem to eat.\nAnd they always seem to in\nair quotes have eaten earlier.\nI ate while I cooked, I\nate while I cooked, right?\nThese people that you\nnever actually see eating,\nwe all know people like\nthis, are they anorexic?\nPossibly, we don't know.\nA child observes that kind of behavior.\nMaybe that individual is\nbeing always being told how\nbeautiful they look or how\nwonderful or fit they look,\nwhat incredible meals they produce.\nAnd you could imagine a purely\npsychosocial set of events\nthat could lead a child to be anorexic.\nThat doesn't seem to be the case,\nat least not in terms of driving classic,\nanorexia, a really extreme\ndeprivation of oneself from food.\nHowever, there is a strong\ngenetic component for anorexia.\nSo, you could imagine a mild\nform of anorexia in a parent\nthat is supported or\nexacerbated by praise,\nso that the person feels\ngood from the praise\nthey're getting, that they\nwant to be a low body weight\nfor whatever reason,\nfor aesthetic reasons or for\nwhatever reasons that happened\nto appeal to them.\nAnd the child has a genetic\npredisposition, right?\nWe never think about genes in\nterms of controlling behavior,\ngenes, bias, probabilities\nfor behavior, okay?\nSo, you can have a gene for\ndepression of schizophrenia,\nbut it's not deterministic,\nin the same way\nthat there are genes that\ndetermine your eye color,\nor your skin color or\nyour hair color, okay?\nSo, there's a genetic\npredisposition there.\nAnd that genetic predisposition\ncould exist such that if one\nis rewarded enough times\nfor a particular behavior,\nthat behavior can start to ratchet in\nto our neural circuitry,\nbecause behavior drives neural changes,\nso called neuroplasticity.\nAnd you could imagine that\nthat child could develop\na full-blown case of anorexia.\nAnd this is why I raised at the\nbeginning that no one really\nknows how to define healthy eating.\nAnd so therefore we have to\nrely on just identification\nof unhealthy behaviors,\nbut what do we point people to in terms\nof what healthy replacement\nbehaviors would be.\nSo, rather than just look\nat anorexics and say,\nthey're not eating enough.\nAnd there's this huge\narray of terrible things\nthat they're doing to their\nbody, and they need to eat more.\nWe need to rescue them from themselves.\nLet's look under the hood.\nLet's look at, what's known\nabout the neural circuitry\nand the sorts of perceptions and behaviors\nof the neural circuitry is driving,\nin order to understand what\nthey are truly suffering from,\nat the level of cause ,not just symptoms,\nit's clear what they're\nsuffering from at the level\nof symptoms, symptoms are how we diagnose.\nI listed off a number of those things,\nbut let's look under the\nhood and try and identify\nwhere one could intervene in theory,\nin order to try and rescue the anorexic\nor help the anorexic rescue themselves.\nBecause it turns out that\nthe answer or at least one\nof the answers of how to do\nthat is not intuitive at all.\nAt least to me was very surprising.\nI would be remiss if I didn't\nstart with the obvious,\nwhich is, is there a chemical defect?\nMeaning is there some\ndisruption in one of the major\nchemical systems in the brain\nthat makes anorexics anorexic\nand therefore, can we\nreplace that chemical?\nOr can we reduce some chemical\nand essentially eliminate anorexia?\nAnd the answer is not\nreally sort of maybe no,\nhere's why, there are a\nlot of different chemicals\nin the brain and body,\nbut there are a category of\nchemicals that are particularly\nimportant that if you've\nlistened to this podcast before,\neven if you haven't are\ngoing to come up again\nand again and again,\nand that is the category\nof chemicals in the brain\nand body called the neuromodulators,\nneuromodulators are different\nthan neuro-transmitters\nin the sense that\nneuromodulators modulator\nor change the activity of\nbrain areas in neural circuits,\nyou can think of them as\nmicrophones that are held\nbetween particular sets of\nconnections in the brain\nthat make those connections in the brain,\nmore likely to be active\nrelative to others, okay?\nThey make them louder so to speak,\nthere are many neuromodulators,\nbut the ones that are important for sake\nof today's discussion\nare the classic ones,\ndopamine, acetylcholine,\nor epinephrin and serotonin.\nLet's focus on serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neuromodulator\nthat tends to increase\nthe activity of certain neural circuits,\nincluding within the hypothalamus,\nbut also within the body that\ntrigger a sense of satiety,\nof having enough, enough\nfood, enough warmth,\nenough social connection,\nenough of any motivated goal\nor drive or any type of thing\nor behavior that one would want more of,\nserotonin tends to make\nthose circuits quiet down.\nNow, there are many categories\nof drugs that emphasize\nthe serotonergic circuitry,\nmeaning they cause the release\nof, or the efficiency of\nserotonin in the brain and body.\nThings like Prozac, Zoloft,\nPaxil, things of that variety.\nThose drugs have been used\nto some degree of success.\nAlthough not much to treat\nthings like anorexia nervosa.\nThat should make sense,\nbecause if these drugs increase\nserotonin, if their general\neffect is to increase serotonin,\nit will be to lower anxiety.\nThat sounds like a great thing.\nA lot of anorexics are\nreally anxious around food.\nWe'll talk about why, lowering\nanxiety you might think\nwould lead to ingestion of more food,\nbut that's not often what\nhappens, increasing serotonin,\nby way of some drug regimen will tend\nto make one less hungry,\nbecause with heightened levels\nof serotonin in the blood and brain,\nthere isn't the desire\nto go seek out the things\nthat will raise serotonin on their own.\nNow, some anorexics do well or benefit\nfrom these serotonergic drugs,\nthese drugs that increase the\nactivity of these circuits\nthat leads to satiety.\nBut if you think about\nthe major goal of treating\nan anorexic it's to get them\nto have more hunger, more appetite.\nSo, now I want to focus on some\nof the work that's been done\naround the habits and\nbehaviors of anorexics,\nbecause those turned\nout to be ideal places for intervention.\nThe work I'm about to describe was done\nby Dr. Joanna Steinglass and colleagues\nat Columbia University in New York.\nAnd there are other groups as well.\nOf course, they're\ndoing this type of work,\nbut they did what I think\nare really some beautiful\nexperiments and some\nbeautiful explorations\nof potential treatments for anorexics.\nThat seemed to have a quite high degree\nof effectiveness when they\nare applied correctly.\nFirst of all, there's a\nchallenge in studying anorexia\nbecause in anorexia,\nwhat you're essentially\nstudying is the absence\nof a behavior.\nIt's very hard to study\nthe absence of a behavior,\nas opposed to a behavior.\nSo, they did some\nexperiments with anorexics,\ngiving them a gallery of\npictures of different foods,\nand allowing those anorexia patients\nto arrange those foods,\naccording to preference\nabout what they would select,\nabout food, nutrient content\nabout caloric content.\nThey essentially asked these\nanorexics to evaluate food,\nand in doing so,\nthey were able to identify\nsomething that's very unique\nto anorexics at the level\nof their perception of food.\nWhat they found is the anorexics,\nrather than being anxious\nin the presence of food,\nand that anxiety driving\nand avoidance of food.\nWhat they found is that\nanorexics have a hyper acuity,\na hyper awareness of the\nfat content of foods,\nalmost to the point of being\nsort of fat content savant.\nNow they don't necessarily\nknow that they're doing this.\nThey're not looking at an\navocado and thinking, okay,\nthat's X number of grams of fat rather,\nor looking at an apple and\nsaying, okay, that has no fat.\nThey start to do this\nmore or less reflexively.\nNow it's a well-known symptom of anorexia,\nespecially young anorexics\nthat they have kind\nof an obsession with\nfood, caloric contents,\nmacronutrient ratios, meaning fat protein\nand carbohydrate ratios.\nThey know caloric numbers,\nbut then they sort of\npass that information\ninto a memory system in\ntheir brain that allows\ntheir interactions with\nfood, to be very reflexive\nin a way that they are actively\navoiding high-fat content,\nfoods, calorie rich foods,\nand defaulting towards\nvery low calorie foods.\nIf they have to eat.\nNow, this might seem like\nan almost trivial result\non the face of it, you think, okay,\nthey don't like to eat when they do eat.\nThey eat low calorie, low fat foods, duh,\nbut it's the way in which they\nare doing this subconsciously\nthat they learn this\ninformation and then they pass\nit off to a reflexive habit.\nAnd that's very important\nbecause what that means\nis that we need to look at\nwhat processes in the brain,\nwhat brain areas,\nwhat chemicals drive\ndecision-making and knowledge.\nAnd we also need to look\nat the areas of the brain\nthat drive habit formation\nand habit execution,\nbecause for any of you that have habits.\nAnd that means all of you,\nthe hallmark feature of a\nhabit is that it's reflexive.\nYou have a mosquito bite on\nyour leg, you scratch it.\nYou didn't necessarily even think, oh,\nI'm going to scratch that.\nIn fact, just to take a little\nbit of a moment of respites\nand talk about habits in general,\nthere's a beautiful\nstudy that was done out\nof Caltech University,\nlooking at the parking\nlot of where people park\nin the morning, without\ndesignated parking spots,\nand the trajectories that they\nuse to walk to their offices\nin the morning.\nSo, they put cameras up\non the roof of Caltech,\nis the kind of thing that\nthe nerdy kids at Caltech do.\nI think at Caltech,\nif you call someone a nerdy\nis I think it's a compliment.\nSo, my apologies to the\nnon nerds at Caltech,\nI think there's one or two\nof you and for the nerdy ones\nof you at Caltech, you're welcome.\nThey videotaped the\nbehaviors of these faculty\nand students and staff.\nAnd what they found, is that\npeople follow trajectories\nfrom their car that are\nremarkably stereotype.\nFirst of all, they tend to\npark always in the same spot.\nIf they can, they tend\nto get out of their car.\nOf course, 'cause they're\non the driver's side\nor passenger side in the same place.\nThey turn and pivot their\nbody at approximately\nthe same rate every day.\nThey close the door,\nthey've put their bag on their shoulder\nor across their chest,\nor however it is that\nthey carry their briefcase\nor whatever it is.\nAnd they follow trajectories onto campus\nthat are so stereotyped.\nThat you'd wonder if you just trace line,\nafter line after line.\nWhat you'd find is that every\nday is almost exactly the same\nand you do this too.\nYou don't realize it because\nif you're being videotaped\nin this kind of behavior, it's\nnot being released to you,\nbut your behaviors are so\nstereotyped to the point\nwhere if you were to see them\nlaid out in front of you,\nin kind of diagrammatic\nformat of the lines\nand the trajectories that you\nfollow throughout the day,\nthe lifting of your mug and how frequently\nyou drink each hour,\nyou would be amazed and\nprobably a little bit scared\nby how much of a robot we all are.\nNow that robotic aspect of\nour neurocircuitry is vital,\nbecause it's what allows us\nto think about other things\nand do other things, and\ndrive other behaviors.\nBut the work of Dr. Steinglass\nand colleagues showed\nthat in the case of the anorexic,\nthose habits are exactly\nthe place where things start\nto go awry.\nAnd that drive this very\ndysfunctional under-eating behavior\nthat sadly often leads to death\nor certainly bad medical outcomes.\nAnd it turns out that the\nbrain areas associated\nwith habit formation and execution\nare the best point of intervention.\nSo, what Dr. Steinglass\nand colleagues did,\nis they took anorexics and they\nof course had control groups\nand they put them in an FMRI scanner,\nwhich are these brain scanners\nthat allow you to evaluate\nwhich brain areas are active,\nduring particular tasks.\nAnd because when you're\nin one of those scanners,\nyou actually, you know,\nI've actually been in one of these things.\nYou're biting down on a\nbite bar and you're most\nof the time and most all of\nthese scanners you're immobile.\nSo, you're looking at\nthings on a TV screen.\nSometimes you can press\nbuttons to select choices\nand so forth, but you can't\nreally eat within those things.\nWhat they found was that\nreward based decision-making,\nthe drive to pursue a\nparticular food or the drive\nto perform a particular task,\nwhich is a lot of what\nwe do throughout our day,\nthat was controlled by a brain area called\nthe ventromedial prefrontal cortex.\nLet me simplify a little bit of this,\nbut I'm going to simplify it\nby giving you a little detail,\nbecause it's the Huberman Lab Podcast.\nAnd I believe in mechanism,\nmechanism is the way that\nyou get true understanding\nand that you can then be\nvery quick and give overviews\nof things, but you need the mechanism.\nSo, you have reflexes and\nyou have neural processes\nthat include what are called duration path\nand outcome type processes,\na duration path, outcome type process,\nwe can shorten with DPO.\nDPO is for all types of\ngoal related behaviors.\nSo, for instance,\nif you want to get a\nparticular grade on an exam,\nyou want to learn something,\nyou want to complete a workout.\nYou want to go to the grocery\nstore and pick some stuff up\nand then head home.\nYou're going to think duration.\nHow long do I have, okay,\ndo I have 45 minutes to get to the store?\nHow long does it take to\nget to the store path?\nWhich way am I going to drive there?\nWhich way am I going to navigate\nthrough the grocery store,\noutcome, was able to get\nin and get the items I need\nand get home in time, okay?\nDPO, duration path outcome.\nIt's a very conscious process.\nYou tend to take into account\ndifferent criteria related\nto what's preventing\nyou from accomplishing\nwhat you want to do\nand what's helping you or assisting you.\nSo, of course,\nas you get to the checkout\nline in the grocery store,\nyou're going to select the\nshortest line for instance.\nSo, that's all DPO stuff.\nIt requires decision-making\nand it's reward-based,\nyou use these DPO type\nprocesses in the short term\nto pick up groceries and pick\na line at the grocery store\nand decide which trajectory to take home.\nAnd you use them for navigating\nlong extended processes\nin life, trying to get a\ndegree or raise children\nor get through a particularly\nchallenging year, et cetera.\nSo, duration path outcome,\nand that entire process\nrelies on your fore brain.\nThis prefrontal cortex,\nthe prefrontal cortex is what allows you\nto take information from memory,\ncombine it with information\nabout what's happening\nin the present context, and\nthen to direct your behavior,\nyour speech, et cetera,\ntoward particular outcomes.\nAnd if all that sounds\nlike a mouthful, it is,\nand it's very metabolically demanding,\ndecision-making is\nmetabolically demanding.\nIt takes effort, okay?\nReflexes on the other hand,\ndon't involve the prefrontal\ncortex in the same way,\nhabits and reflexes.\nLike once you know how to\nwalk, you get up and you walk,\nyou don't have to think\nabout right foot, left foot,\nright foot, left foot.\nYou just do it.\nThat doesn't rely on prefrontal cortex.\nIt's subconscious as\nit's sometimes called,\nbut basically you don't have\nto use the parts of the brain\nthat are involved in duration path\nand outcome type analysis.\nOkay, so, in this particular study,\nthey examined brain activity in anorexics\nwho are selecting different foods.\nAnd as I mentioned earlier,\nthey have a hyper acuity or\nawareness of which foods contain\nmore or less calories than other foods\nand what the fat content\nof particular foods is,\nin particular, et cetera,\nthey're doing all this while in a scanner.\nAnd then they look at\nwhat sorts of brain areas\nare active after that task is done.\nAnd what they found\nwas really interesting,\nwhat they found was that the\ndorsal lateral prefrontal\ncortex not surprisingly is\ninvolved in the decision-making\nand the evaluation of this food,\nwhich foods are going to be\nbest to eat in this context,\nwhich foods are going to\nbe appropriate for at least\nthat anorexics framework\nabout what's okay to eat\nand what's not okay to eat and how much.\nHowever, there are areas of the\nbrain that were active after\nthat decision-making process.\nAnd those are the brain\nareas that turn out to drive\nthe habit of avoiding particular foods\nand approaching other foods.\nAnd in that case,\nit wasn't the dorsolateral\nprefrontal cortex.\nIt was an area of the brain called\nthe dorsal lateral striatum.\nNow the striatum is a\nbig area in the brain.\nIt's involved in a lot\nof different things.\nIt includes areas like\nthe caudate and putamen.\nAnd I just want to mention, as\nI throw out all these names,\nyou do not need to remember the names\nof these different structures.\nThey're just there,\nif you are interested\nin that level of detail,\nbut basically you have a\nbrain area and anorexics\nhave a brain area that's\ninvolved in evaluating\nand decision-making around food.\nAnd then another brain\narea that's involved\nin the reflexive consumption\nof particular foods\nand the reflexive\navoidance of other foods.\nIf you remember way back at\nthe beginning of the episode,\nI feel like that was a long time ago now.\nWhen we talked about how you\nhave these sorts of processes\nin the brain,\nbut there are always homeostatic\nand reward systems influencing\nthis kind of thing.\nWell, in the brain of the anorexic,\nit turns out that the reward\nsystems have been attached\nto the execution of habits\nin a way that is unhealthy\nfor body weight,\nbut at least from a purely\nneural circuit perspective,\nthe reward is now given this\nchemical reward in the brain,\nis given for avoiding particular\nfoods and only approaching\nthese very low calorie, low fat foods.\nSo, there really does seem\nto be a flip in the switch,\nin the anorexic brain that\nrewards them internally.\nThey feel good when\nthey avoid certain foods\nand they approach others.\nSo, it's not a deprivation based model\nwhere they are flagellating\nthemselves or masochistic\nor actively avoiding food in\norder to punish themselves,\nwhich is interesting because a\nlot of psychological theories\nsupport that idea.\nRather, once this transitions\ninto a set of habits,\nthey are actually getting\na sense of reward.\nThey feel good, presumably\nfrom the release\nof a different neuromodulator\ncalled dopamine,\nby approaching foods that are\nlow fat, low calorie content.\nAnd so their whole brain circuitry\nis skewed toward avoiding\nparticular things.\nAnd they actually are rewarded\nfor that, and they feel good.\nThey feel better than if they were eating\nin a healthy weight supporting way.\nNow the dorsolateral\nstriatum is a structure\nthat we should think about\nin a little bit more depth.\nIt's part of a set of\ncircuits that are involved\nin what are called go no-go tasks.\nAnd I don't want to go into this in a lot\nof detail right now,\nbecause it would take us too far down\nthe rabbit hole of neurocircuitry.\nBut basically in terms of behaviors,\nwe both have DPO type behaviors.\nSo, decision-making,\nreward based behaviors.\nAnd we have habits that\nwe learn and we acquire.\nAnd then we just start to\nreflexively, things like walking,\nthings like yawning when we're tired,\nthings like taking a particular route\nthrough the parking lot, right?\nWe learned that the first time\nwe go to a given parking lot\nand walk into a building.\nBut after that, we tend to follow\nthe exact same trajectory\nbecomes very automatized.\nIt's just like, we just\ndo it without thinking.\nWell, the go no-go\ncircuitry is another aspect\nof our behavior,\nwhere we both have to\nselect behaviors to perform.\nAnd we have to select\nbehaviors to suppress.\nAnd the anorexic brain\nseems to reward suppression\nof one set of behaviors,\ningestion of high calorie\nfoods, and to reward focus,\nor even hyper-focus and\nconsumption of low fat,\nlow calorie foods.\nSo, this homeostatic process that we learn\nabout from like high school onward,\nthat, oh, everything in\nyour body is designed\nto keep everything in balance.\nYou stay awake for a\ncertain amount of time.\nYou want to sleep, you\ndon't eat for a while.\nThen you want to eat to\nmaintain weight, right?\nYou eat too much.\nThen you want to eat less.\nThose systems are disrupted.\nAnd so what's so beautiful about this work\nfrom the Columbia group,\nis that what it says\nis the place to intervene\nhas to be the habit.\nThis stuff has already passed\nthrough all the learning,\nit's passed through\nall the reward systems.\nIt's clearly not being overrun\nby the homeostatic processes\nof the body.\nThere's very little body fat.\nThere's no leptin,\nwhatever neurons in the brain\nrespond to leptin are starved\nfor leptin, periods of\nshutdown, sperm production,\nand testosterone is lowered.\nBone density is down.\nClearly, this is overriding all\nthose homeostatic processes,\nall the signals that\nwould say eat, eat, eat.\nThose don't matter in the\nbrain of the anorexic.\nIn the brain of the anorexic\nis just performing habits\nand they're being rewarded for it.\nSo, when you come along and say, look,\nyou should really eat this\nwhole pie or this whole pizza\nyou'll feel better.\nThat's how she aversive to them.\nSo, since it appears to be a habit,\na reflex that's perpetuating\nthe anorexic phenotype.\nAs we say, in science,\nit's perpetuating anorexia\nin this individual\nand telling them about\nall this terrible stuff\nthat's happening in their body won't work,\ntaking them away from all the images\nof thin people online, et cetera.\nThat's not going to work.\nWhat's going to work.\nWhat's going to work is intervening\nin the neural circuitry.\nThat's related to the habit itself.\nAnd it turns out that\nthere are ways to do that.\nSo, how do you break a habit?\nHow do you rewire the brain circuitry\nthat's literally causing a reflex?\nAnd in this case causing a reflex\nthat is killing the individual,\nor at least leading to\nvery bad health outcomes.\nThe way that you do that is\nthrough a cognitive mechanism\nwhere you teach the individual,\nwhat is leading up to the habit?\nThis is a little bit similar\nto the way that somebody\nwho suffers from addiction starts to put\nin different constraint type behaviors,\nconstraint type behaviors,\nare the sorts of things\nlike where the alcoholic\nwill call a hotel ahead\nof time and say, listen,\nI want the mini bar taken out of the room.\nI don't want a television\nin the room, et cetera,\nconstraint type behaviors.\nThose are really ways of keeping oneself\nfrom the temptation.\nBut with these habits,\nthey work at such a subconscious level.\nThat what seems to work best\nis a combination of teaching\nthe individual about their internal state\nand how to register their internal state.\nWhat we call interoception this ability\nto perceive your internal state,\nso that they can start to learn,\nto associate the interactions\nwith different types of food,\nwith the sorts of cues that are\noccurring within their body,\nquickening of heart rate,\nhyper acuity of focus that\nwe talked about earlier.\nOnce they start to be able\nto notice that those things\nare happening, then they\ncan start to intervene.\nSo, let's talk about what\nthose things are that lead\ninto a habit,\nbecause those turn out to\nbe the exact points of entry\nfor changing and eliminating\nand rewiring habits,\nto a more healthy behaviors.\nAnd I should highlight that\nthis isn't just about rewiring\nhabits for sake of the anorexic.\nThese are also the same types\nof mechanisms that one would\nwant to incorporate in\norder to rewire any habit\nof any kind.\nThere are two main features of thinking\nthat go into the sorts of\nhabits that anorexics execute.\nThe first is something called\nweak central coherence.\nWeak central coherence is\nessentially an inability\nto see the forest through the trees.\nIt's a hyper acuity and focus on details\nwithin a given environment.\nAnd there's actually an\ninteresting probe test for anorexia\nthat involves something akin\nto kind of a where's Waldo type\nof puzzle, where an image is put up.\nThe one that I saw was one\nin which there is a big\narray of coffee beans.\nActually, they're all brown coffee beans.\nAnd your job is to identify\nwhere in that array\nof coffee beans, there's a face.\nAnd indeed there's a\nface embedded in there.\nIt looks a little bit like a coffee bean,\nbut once you see it,\nyou realize it's a face,\nnot a coffee bean.\nAnd it becomes very hard to\nnot notice the face after that.\nAnorexics, are very good\nat identifying the face.\nThey find it much faster\nthan do non-anorexics,\nwhich is really interesting, right?\nThey somehow are able\nto hone in on details\nand find those details and\nfixate on those details.\nNow eventually, most, if not\nall people find the face,\nbut once you do what you will\nfind and what everyone finds\nis that you can't unfine\nthe face, it just jumps out.\nSo, what essentially\nyou've lost is the ability\nto see the whole picture,\nbecause there's some\ndetail within that picture\nthat you're obsessed by.\nSo, this has kind of elements\nof obsessive compulsive disorder,\nbut it's not really obsessive\ncompulsive disorder per se.\nSo, we call that weak central coherence.\nIt's a hyper acuity on\none particular feature.\nYou miss the big picture.\nThe other is a challenge in set shifting\nthat once you identify something\nthat's of particular interest\nand that's driving some sort\nof reward, for the anorexic\nthat would be identifying the\nhigh-fat foods or identifying\nthe one food on the table that\none could eat without anyone,\nhopefully noticing that they're\neating just the green beans\nand not touching any of the other food.\nIf you ever had a meal with an anorexic.\nYou might be familiar with this.\nIt's kind of uncomfortable to be around.\nActually they go through a\nlot of elaborate procedures\nto kind of hide food too.\nThey'll sometimes even chew food,\nhold it in their mouth and\nthen go to the bathroom\nand discard it things, very elaborate,\nvery troubling types of\nthings to hear about,\nand to be around.\nBut you'll notice that they push food\naround their plate a lot.\nThey become masterful actually at trying\nto keep people's awareness\naway from what they're doing,\nwhich is to hone in on these\nlow fat, low calorie foods.\nAnd they can't seem to set shift.\nThey can't just relax and enjoy\nthe meal, because the meal\nfor them is essentially\nlike this where's Waldo\nor find the face in the\ncoffee being tasked.\nThey're constantly monitoring\nhow much people are observing\nthem and trying to navigate this.\nWhat would otherwise be a\nreally pleasant circumstance\nfor most people they're trying to navigate\nthrough this because remember for them,\nthe reward is in the\navoidance of certain things\nand the acquiring of only the foods\nthat their brain rewards them for,\nbecause those are the foods\nthat have been preselected\nand are now habit.\nWhat's amazing.\nAnd frankly also important\nare these findings\nthat once you teach anorexics,\nwhat's happening to them,\nthat they're doing this,\nthey are able to intervene.\nNow they need support, right?\nAnd another form of therapy\nthat seems to work well\nfor anorexics that ideally is combined\nwith this habit rewiring,\nis a family-based model.\nFamily-based models are\nstarting to surface a lot now\nin various therapy settings,\ntherapy based models\nin short are basically\nwhere the entire family is made aware\nof the individual's challenges\nwith a particular eating\ndisorder or other disorder.\nAnd in understanding some of\nthe biology and psychology\naround it, they stopped\ncondemning the individual.\nThey start to support that\nindividual through queuing them\ntowards their own habits\nthat they observe.\nThey give them some autonomy.\nThey realize that none of\nthis changes overnight,\nbut they're taught about\nthings like neuroplasticity\nand the ability to change one's brain\nin response to experience.\nAnd so there's a whole\ninternal support network.\nNow, for people that live alone,\nthis isn't available to them.\nThis isn't the kind of\nthing that you share\nwith your coworkers.\nYou might involve a\nclose friend or a spouse,\nbut it's not the sort of thing\nthat people that don't live\nin a family context can\nreally benefit from.\nAll of these things\nfall under the umbrella\nof cognitive behavioral therapy.\nAnd I should mention that\ncognitive behavioral therapies\nare often done in conjunction\nwith pharmacologic therapies.\nI think that there's this idea\nout there that it's either,\nor when often it's both.\nSo, cognitive behavioral are\noften combined with this habit\nrecognition and rewiring approach,\nwhich is starting to become\nmore and more common.\nAnd I think the date on\nit looked really good\nthat especially when it\nindividuals are taught this early\nin adolescence, that there are\npositive outcomes over time,\nthe relapse rate of\nanorexia is quite high.\nIt's about 50% of individuals\nwill relapse at some point\noften triggered by a\nstressful life circumstance.\nBut the combination of\ncognitive behavioral therapy\nthat includes this family model,\nor at least habit reformulation seems\nto be fairly effective.\nAnd at present might be the\nmost effective treatment.\nNow there are additional\ntreatments starting to surface,\nand that takes us into the realm\nof chemical treatments for anorexia.\nAnd I just want to mention\nthat there are clinical trials,\nmeaning legal clinical trials being done\nat Johns Hopkins School of\nMedicine by Matthew Johnson\nand others, exploring how drugs like MDMA,\nwhich increases dopamine and\nserotonin to very high levels\nor siliciden so-called magic mushrooms,\nwhich increases serotonin\nand other compounds\nto very high levels within the confines\nof a professionally supported\ntherapeutic environment\ncan help people rewire their brain,\nsuch that they can get\nrelief from major depression\nand various forms of trauma.\nAnd now eating disorders\nare also being explored\nin the context of MDMA and\nsiliciden clinical trials.\nI do want to emphasize that\nthose are clinical trials,\nthat those compounds are not yet legal.\nAnd in many cases, most\ncases they are still illegal.\nI do not think that\nthey should be explored\nwithout a properly trained medical doctor,\nthat the clinical trials are\nessential to complete before\none explores those\ncompounds in particular,\nbecause lately I get a lot of\nemails about these compounds.\nPeople telling me that they've\nhad amazing experiences\nand relief from various things,\nnot just eating disorders,\nbut depression, et cetera.\nHowever, I get an equal number\nof emails from people saying\nthat they worked with\nsome self appointed guide.\nThis would be outside the\nclinical trials I was referring\nto, and they are now experiencing\nchronic visual, snow.\nThey're getting genuine\nvisual field deficits.\nThey are havering ticks that\nthey have never had before,\nthey have chronic insomnia.\nSo, I'm not passing judgment\non any of these compounds\nor the people that are\ndoing this sort of thing.\nI just want to see the clinical data.\nAnd I do believe that we should\nwait until these clinical\ntrials are done before people\nstart approaching the stuff.\nAnd that's because they\nare serious compounds.\nThey can open plasticity,\nbut whether or not they work quote unquote\nfor different types of eating disorders\nor depression and trauma, the\ndata are looking promising,\nbut that the clinical\ntrials are still not done.\nAnd I know a number of people\nare going out of the U.S.\nand into other countries\nwhere this stuff is being done\nmore regularly and there too.\nI've gotten reports back of people doing\nso-called ibogaine treatments.\nSome of you who are familiar\nwith eating disorders\nwill immediately be asking,\nwell, what about ibogaine?\nDoes it work?\nDoes it work?\nWell, the clinical trials in\nthis country are not complete.\nI've heard evidence direct.\nI've heard directly from\npeople who have benefited\nfrom the sorts of things, for\ntreatment of eating disorders.\nBut I've also heard of people\nthat have developed chronic\nseizure disorders from\npursuing things like ibogaine\nfor the treatment of eating disorders.\nSo, again, I'm not passing judgment.\nI would just like to see more data.\nAnd it's very important\nthat the safety aspects\nof safety be in place.\nSo, this is definitely not\nsomething to get renegade about.\nSo, it appears that once\nanorexia has established\nthat habit breaking through self-awareness\nof what the habits are,\nis going to be a primary entry point.\nThat might seem kind of trivial.\nYou might say, well,\ncould you have just told\nus that in one sentence,\nbut I want to return us to this model\nabout homeostatic processes,\nreward, processes, et cetera.\nThat leads us to a place\nwhere the short answer is no,\nyou can't simply say break the habit.\nAn individual needs to be informed\nabout where that habit comes from.\nAnd the fact that what currently seems\nlike a rewarded habit should\nactually be a punished habit.\nNow, I don't mean by actual punishment,\nbut what I mean is within the brain,\nthere's been a switch\nand the anorexic needs\nto learn that there's been a\nswitch such that what should\nbe rewarding is now punished\nand what should be punished.\nStarvation is now rewarded.\nThe beauty of being a human\nbeing is that knowledge\nof knowledge can allow you\nto make better decisions.\nI'll say that again,\nthe beauty of being a human\nbeing is that knowledge\nof knowledge can allow you\nto make better decisions.\nNow, of course, when we are\nanxious, when we are tired,\nwhen we are intoxicated,\nwe have less access to that\nability to use knowledge\nof knowledge, to intervene.\nThe anorexic will often do\nthings that are in keeping\nwith their habits, such as overexercising.\nThis is a area that anyone\nwho's treated anorexics\nor interacted with\nanorexics is well aware of,\nthat they are constantly moving.\nThey're constantly on the treadmill.\nThey're constantly running.\nThey always want to be\nmoving and burning calories,\nso that they can feel\nokay about interacting\nwith food or because they\nhave the distorted body image.\nWell, does breaking a habit mean\nthat they should stop moving\naround and exercising?\nNo, not necessarily.\nThere's some really\ninteresting studies that show\nthat shifting anorexics towards activities\nthat for instance, build\nmuscle resistance training\nand allow them to eat a bit more food\nwithout necessarily losing weight,\nbut rather to put more\nmuscle on their body\ncan actually be beneficial.\nNow I'm not talking about\nanorexics becoming bodybuilders,\nhas all body dysmorphia\nassociated with bodybuilding,\nbut certain forms of\nexercise are just catabolic.\nMeaning they break down\nthe amount of muscle.\nThey reduce body weight, overall,\nother types of exercises\nlike resistance training\nor anabolic, they allow\nmuscle to be put on.\nAnd there are some interesting\nstudies, not a lot,\nbut some interesting studies\ntrying to encourage anorexics,\nnot to stop exercising,\nbut rather to stop exercising\nin this neurotic catabolic way\nof breaking oneself down,\nbut rather getting them\nshifted toward breaking habits\nof only approaching low\ncalorie, low fat foods,\nwhile also encouraging them to\nembark on resistance training\nand to start to learn and\nreward the relationship\nbetween exercise for sake\nof making one's body strong,\nincluding the bones, not just\nthe muscles, but the bones,\nwhich is important,\nespecially in anorexics.\nAnd then to see food as a\nway to nourish that process,\nto building a body that could\nbe of the stable weight.\nHopefully there, once the\nanorexic is of a healthy weight\nthat they're maintaining that weight,\nbut that they don't have to\nconstantly be on this treadmill,\nno pun intended of balancing\nwhatever food intake\nthey have with activity.\nAnd along the lines of that.\nDuring the episode on fat\nloss and metabolism as well,\nI talked about this neat\nand non-exercise induced\nthermogenesis where people\nwho tend to be thin,\ntend to bounce around a lot.\nThey're kind of fidgety\nand that burns 1000\nof calories a day, anywhere\nfrom 800 to 2000 calories a day.\nNow that can be beneficial for\nthe folks that are overweight\nand have a healthy mindset about food,\nbut are trying to lose weight.\nAnd it turns out that by, you\nliterally fidgeting and\nbouncing around, like,\nthis is why I'm doing this.\nIt looks ridiculous.\nYou actually burn a lot\nof body fat and calories.\nThat way provide you're\nin a caloric deficit,\nyou'll burn body fat\nbecause body fat is not just\na passive tissue.\nIt actually receives input from neurons\nthat release noradrenaline and adrenaline.\nAnd this neat.\nHas been described for\nseveral decades now.\nAnd it actually is a pretty terrific way\nto burn off more calories.\nSo, with the anorexic,\nyou actually want to encourage\nthem to not constantly\nbe trying to burn off calories.\nThat can be very challenging.\nSo, shifting them toward\nactivities like weight bearing\nactivities or resistance\ntraining that promote\nthis more anabolic type of\nrelationship to activity,\nas opposed to catabolic can be beneficial.\nBefore we move on to talking\nabout bulimia and some related\ndisorders, I want to talk\nabout an aspect of anorexia.\nThat's very interesting,\nquite troubling in fact,\nbut that has received a lot of attention\nand that's the distorted self image.\nNow, episode and depression,\nwe talked about a very powerful\naspect of major depression,\nwhich is this anti-self\nconfabulation that people\nwho are depressed seem\nto genuinely believe.\nAnd even confabulate about the fact\nthat they are performing poorly in life\nand that they are no good or\nnot, or worthless, et cetera.\nIt's literally a lie that they\nbelieve and their statements\nand their feelings and\ntheir behaviors start\nto reflect that lie.\nThey're not conscious of it.\nThat's why we call it a confabulation.\nAnorexics often will see\nthemselves as overweight\nor imperfect in ways that\nare of an obsession for them,\nthey'll think, oh, you know,\ntheir arms are a little bit fat, you know,\nor, you know, the contour,\ntheir face makes they\ndon't like the pictures\nof themselves or they.\nWhat I'm describing here is\nactually pretty typical behavior\nof a lot of people.\nI mean, how many people do\nyou know that after you take\na picture of them, they\nsay, can I see the picture?\nAnd then they tell you that\nyou have to throw it away.\nThat doesn't necessarily\nmean they're anorexic\nor they're suffering from\nsome sort of disorder.\nThat just means that they're\na human being that cares\nabout how they appear in the world.\nWe're not here to judge that\nin the case of the anorexic.\nThe problem seems to be that\nthey have a genuine distortion\nof their self image so much so\nthat they don't actually see\nthemselves accurately, their\nvisual perceptions are off.\nAnd the reason we know this,\nit's because of some really important\nand beautiful studies that\nwere done with my colleague,\nJeremy Bailenson's lab at Stanford,\nhe's in the department of communications,\nhe's actually collaborated\nwith a Dr. Halpern that\nI mentioned earlier.\nWhat's really interesting about\nthese studies is they give\nus a window into the perceptual\ndefect that anorexics have.\nI've actually done one\nof these experiments.\nI'm fortunate to not be anorexic,\nbut I've done some work\nwith the VR lab over there.\nAnd what you get to do is\nyou get to adjust this avatar\nof yourself to the point\nwhere you think it's,\nas accurate as it could possibly be,\nand anorexics, really distort this avatar.\nIn other words,\nthey create this serious\nmismatch between their perception\nof themselves and the reality.\nSo, indeed it does seem to be\nthe case now what's relieving,\nor I should say what's encouraging\nabout some of the therapies that we talked\nabout before the family based model,\nthe Connie behavioral treatments.\nYes, and the drug treatments as well.\nBut this habit intervention\nmodel is that as one starts\nto shift those things,\nit does appear that the\nperception of self seems\nto follow that the\nperception of self seems\nto shift along with the change in habits.\nAnd that's a relief,\nor at least I find that reassuring\nbecause changing one's\nperception is actually very hard,\nas somebody who's worked\nalmost his entire career\non visual perception and related things.\nThe perceptual apparatus of\nthe brain are not very amenable\nto neuroplasticity, meaning\nthey don't change that easily.\nWhereas it appears that the circuitry\nthat's related to habit\nformation, and decision-making\nand the reward, circuitry,\nthat stuff can be rewired.\nAnd so anorexics as they progress\nout of their anorexic state into one,\nwhich they are intervening\nin their reflexes,\ngaining better habits\naround food, eating more,\nmore accurately, assessing foods\nand environments that\nthey're in related to food,\nas they change their behavior.\nAnd they start to put on healthy weight,\nmaybe they're also doing the\nsorts of exercises that allow\nthem to put on healthy\nweight and avoiding kind\nof extreme exercises of cannibalism\nand breaking themselves down.\nThey also managed to somehow\njust as a consequence\nof all that rewire their\nperception of self.\nSo, it doesn't seem that\ntrying to tell someone,\noh my gosh, you're so thin.\nYou really need to eat.\nThat doesn't seem to work.\nThey just don't see\nthemselves the same way\nthat you see them.\nAnd so I offer that as a\npoint of consideration,\nif you know someone that's anorexic,\nor if you look at an\nanorexic and you think,\nhow is it that they are\nstill critical of the small,\neven nonexistent amount of body fat\non their triceps or something?\nHow is that?\nWell, it's literally that their brain,\nas it relates to perceptions,\nvisual perceptions in particular,\nthey're completely off.\nAnd fortunately by changing habits,\nyou rewire those circuits as well.\nOkay, so let's talk about bulimia,\nwhich is overeating and\nthen purging typically\nby self-induced vomiting or by ingestion\nof laxatives, sometimes also in concert\nwith people taking\nstimulants and fat burners,\nover ingestion of stimulus to\ntry and burn off more energy.\nAnd then we'll also talk\nabout binge eating disorder,\nwhich has a lot of the\nsame features as bulimia,\nbut typically no purging.\nI'm not going to list off\nall the clinical criteria\nthat would allow someone\nto be diagnosed as bulimic\nor binge eating disorder.\nBut the general features are\nthat they ingest far more\ncalories than they need,\nanywhere from 10 to 30 times,\ntheir daily caloric intake,\noftentimes within a two hour period,\nwhich is just a staggering\namount of food and nutrients\nin a short period of time.\nOftentimes they're overriding\nthose mechanical signals\nfrom the body that they're full.\nIt's a really troubling\nthing to think about,\nbut people are literally\ngorging themselves with food.\nThis looks a lot like a laboratory animal\nthat has these AgRP neurons stimulated,\nthese neurons that will eat\nuntil they almost burst or burst.\nSo, you wonder is that these\nAgRP neurons that are active\nalmost certainly yes.\nThat they're involved.\nAlthough I don't think that that's going\nto be the major point of intervention,\nbut we're going to talk about\nother types of interventions.\nThere are a number of clinical criteria.\nFor instance, if somebody\nhas one of these binges\nonce a year, does that make them bulimic?\nTechnically, no, but I certainly\ndon't recommend people do this.\nIf you are one of these people\nwho has so-called cheat days, right?\nSome of you may be\nfamiliar with cheat days.\nI think they're a little less common now,\nbut the idea is you eat clean for six days\nor five days a week or two weeks.\nAnd then you have a so-called\ncheat day where you just kind\nof go wild and eat whatever\nyou want and whatever volumes\nis that bulimia.\nAnd it has some of the contour of bulimia.\nIf you're vomiting afterwards\nor binge eating disorder,\nif you're not,\ndoes it constitute full blown bulimia\nor binge eating disorder?\nAnd it's pretty hard to say,\nthe criteria that were described\nto me is that if somebody\nis doing this at least once\na month, over a period of\nanywhere from two to three months,\nthen it likely would qualify.\nAnd I certainly know people\nwho do these cheat days\nand by those criteria,\nthey have something like\nbinge eating disorder.\nBut in general,\none of the hallmark features\nof bulimia binge eating\ndisorder is that people are\nunable to control their eating.\nThey're just simply,\nthey're not making the\ndecision to have a cheat day.\nThey're not making the\ndecision to overeat.\nThey are simply driven from\nthe inside without question\nby way of neurocircuitry.\nThey are driven from the\ninside to ingest far more food\nthan they need.\nAnd in some cases than\nthey would want to eat.\nSo, it's a lot like the habit\nthat we described for anorexia,\nit's almost like it's\nturned into a reflux once\nthey get going, all\nthe homeostatic signals\nare being overridden, all\nthe signals from the body,\nthe leptin, the insulin, the glucose,\nall that stuff has cosmically sky high.\nAnd yet they're just what we,\nthe nerds call hyperphagic,\nthey're just eating like crazy.\nSo, what's going on there?\nWell, there've been a lot of ideas,\nabout why this arises.\nThere's the so-called\nthyroid hormone hypothesis.\nThat one's a tricky one.\nIt turns out that cortisol\nand thyroid hormone\nconcentrations vary according\nto when the binge purge happened.\nSo, there were some studies that looked\nat thyroid hormone levels\nand they found elevated\nthyroid hormone levels.\nThyroid hormone is involved in metabolism\nand not just the burning of energy,\nbut the use of energy in\nconverting it to different tissues\nof the body, cartilage bone,\nfat, and muscle, et cetera,\ndid a whole episode on\nthyroid and growth hormone.\nBy the way,\nif you're interested in learning\nmore about thyroid hormone,\nbut thyroid hormone can also\nbe depleted at other phases\nof the binge purge cycle.\nNow, without listing off\nall the terrible things\nthat happen with this binge purge cycle,\nthere are a number of things\nthat are really worth pointing out.\nOne is that the vomiting itself,\nthe use of laxatives that\ncan cause severe disruption\nto the mucosal lining the mucus lining\nof the digestive tract\ncan severely disrupt\nthe gut microbiome.\nIt can cause all sorts of even\na ulceration of the esophagus\nand just really terrible stuff.\nThere's a lot of shame\nassociated with bulimia,\noftentimes because people are\nvomiting and it's hard to hide\nthat vomiting behavior,\npeople are aware of it.\nThere's some social isolation.\nSo, you recall from the beginning,\nit does not appear that sexual trauma\nis a prerequisite for bulimia.\nAlthough sometimes it can\noccur the hallmark feature\nof bulimia that distinguishes\nit from anorexia,\naside from the fact that\nit's overeating as opposed\nto under-eating is a lack\nof what they call inhibitory control.\nAnd that might come as no surprise.\nBut first of all, the bulimic,\nunlike the anorexic is hyper\nimpulsive and oftentimes\nhas other types of impulse behaviors.\nThey might have a little bit of alcohol\nand then start to eat like crazy.\nWhereas normally they're very restrictive.\nThat's a common feature of bulimia,\nsometimes they over ingest\nalcohol during these binges.\nSometimes they are sexually\npromiscuous, not always,\nbut it's a general issue with satiety\nonce they start eating and\nwith impulse control generally.\nAnd for that reason,\nmany of the treatments\nthat you see for bulimia\nand binge eating disorder\nare the sorts of treatments\nthat don't seem to work so well,\nor at least most of the time for anorexia.\nSo, the drugs that increase\nthe neuromodulator serotonin,\nfor instance, fluoxetine\nalso called Prozac, Paxil, et cetera.\nThose things oftentimes can\nbe effective in bulimia.\nSome of the drugs that are\nused to treat attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder an\nADD, a topic that we're going\nto talk about in depth\nhere on the podcast soon,\nsome of those same drugs like Adderall,\nVyvanse and things of\nthat sort can also be used\nto treat bulimia and\nbinge eating disorder.\nWhy would that work?\nWell now you are familiar\nwith the prefrontal cortex.\nYou probably know more\nabout prefrontal cortex\nthan you ever wanted to,\njust from this episode,\nprefrontal cortex is involved\nin this analysis of duration\npath and outcome.\nDuration path and outcome\nis how we avoid impulsivity.\nIt's how we think.\nOkay, if this, then\nthat, if that, then this,\nyou can imagine how for\nthe obsessive compulsive\nor for the anorexic, these are\ncircuits that are overactive.\nFor the bulimic this is\nthe circuit that's going\nto essentially be underactive\nand is under conditions\nwhere they think, oh, you\nknow, I shouldn't eat anything.\nI shouldn't eat anything.\nAnd then they just tear\nthe refrigerator open\nand plow through that.\nAnd then at that point they're\nplowing through the cupboards\nand then they're ordering food.\nAnd then they're feeling\nhorrible about themselves.\nThere do tend to be these cycles\nof binge and purge followed\nby feelings of real shame\nbecause they just can't\ncontrol their behavior.\nAnd what is more embarrassing\nthan not being able to control\none's behavior as an\nadult or as a young adult.\nSo, really the polar opposite\nof what you see in anorexia.\nSo, this lack of impulsivity implies\na lack of prefrontal control.\nWhat we call top-down control.\nWhy do we call it top-down?\nBecause the prefrontal\ncortex is suppressing\nthe activity of deeper limbic\nand hypothalamic circuitry,\nand things of that sort.\nAnytime you feel like\nyou want to say something\nreally offensive and you\ndon't, that's top-down control.\nThat's your prefrontal cortex.\nAnytime someone says something\nand you like grow your teeth.\n'Cause you'd know you\nshouldn't say anything,\ngritting your teeth is\ntop-dow control, okay?\nWhen you explode or burst\nor say the wrong thing,\nor say the thing that you\nshouldn't say or do the thing\nyou shouldn't do, that's\nlack of prefrontal control.\nAnd indeed people who have\nfrontotemporal dementia\ndue to aging or head injuries,\nsee this a lot and people play sports get\na lot frontal damage.\nThey become more impulsive.\nSo, bulimics have an\nissue with impulsivity,\nand therefore drugs that\ncan increase serotonin.\nAnd sometimes these drugs\nthat increase dopamine\nand adrenaline also called epinephrin,\nwill increase the tone as we\ncall it the dopaminergic tone\nor the, it's called adrenergic,\nbut norepinephrine\nlevels in the brain allow\nfor more top-down control.\nAnd that's also why\nthey're used to treat ADHD\nand attention deficit disorder.\nThey tend to create a hyper-focus.\nThey tend to push the brain into,\nthese drugs tend to create a hyper-focus,\nand tend to push the brain\nand general motor processing\ninto one in which you think\nif this, then that, if this,\nthen that, so anticipating outcomes.\nAnd for that reason, drugs\nlike Wellbutrin, bupropion,\nwhich is an antidepressant,\nwhich mainly increases\nthe amount of dopamine\nand norepinephrine and less serotonin,\nthat can also be effective\nfor certain types\nof binge-eating disorder is actually used\nto treat smoking, for\npromoting smoking cessation\nand for depression, but\nalso for certain forms\nof obesity related to\nbinge eating disorder.\nAnd the data are pretty good.\nAnd there are timed release forms\nof this and non-time release forms.\nAnd I think you have to consult\nwith a psychiatrist in order\nto get these prescribed because\nthey are prescription drugs,\nbut it's a very different\nconstellation of neurochemicals\nand brain areas and\napproaches for bulimia.\nThe treatment of binge eating\ndisorder has been explored\nfrom a new standpoint recently.\nAnd that's the work of this now,\nsadly, former colleague of\nmine, Dr. Casey Halpern,\nwho's at University of Pennsylvania\nthat I mentioned earlier,\nthey are using deep brain stimulation\nin order to treat binge-eating disorder.\nNow why deep brain stimulation?\nWell work from Dr.\nHalpern and others while\nat Stanford showed that\nthere are particular patterns\nof brain activity in both\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nbut also in an area of the brain\ncalled the nucleus accumbens,\nvery important and very\nrelevant area of the brain\nin this context,\nand in any discussion\nabout motivated behaviors\nof any kind, feeding,\nsex, drug relay behavior,\npeople exercise compulsively,\nthe nucleus accumbens\nis in a ongoing dialogue\nwith the prefrontal cortex\nand the nucleus accumbens\nhas no mind of its own,\nbut it's associated\nwith dopamine release.\nIt's part of this\nso-called reward pathway.\nAnd what Dr. Halpern and\ncolleagues discovered\nis that there are particular\npatterns of activity\nthat ripple through the brain,\nthrough these prefrontal\nnetworks and through\nthis nucleus accumbens area,\nthose areas are connected.\nIt's called Delta oscillations,\nDelta, just being a particular frequency\nof electrical activity for your aficionado\nas wonderful heart activity.\nBut in any case,\nthose Delta oscillations\nin the nucleus accumbens\nare associated with food\nreward in both mice and humans.\nSomehow this reverberatory\nactivity creates a perception\nin the individual that\nfood is hyper rewarding.\nAnd that's interesting,\nand has allowed them\nto use a targeted deep\nbrain stimulation approach\nto treat binge-eating disorder.\nAnd this deep brain\nstimulation is appearing\nto be an effective treatment.\nThere's still more studies\nthat need to be done.\nActually, if you think you\nhave binge-eating disorder,\nyou can find the criteria for that.\nAnd you could contact Dr. Halpern he's.\nAs I mentioned, he's moving\nto University of Pennsylvania.\nThey are recruiting patients\nfor these studies all the time.\nThe studies are fairly invasive.\nThey involve a FDA approved\napproach of literally placing\na wire down into an\narea of the brain that,\nand allows the individual to\nstimulate a particular brain\narea to offset some of\nthese activity patterns\nthat lead to a elevated\nsense of reward from food\nand binge eating.\nAnd the data looked really promising.\nNow I realize that's a\nvery invasive approach.\nNot everybody is going to be willing\nto have this wire inserted into the brain,\nbut for people that suffer\nfrom binge-eating disorder.\nThis is a great and very\nexciting potential treatment.\nBecause what I didn't tell\nyou is that many people\nhave binge eating disorder are obese\nto the point where their\nhealth is greatly risk.\nNow, obesity causes all sorts\nof shifts in the dialogue\nbetween the brain and body.\nSome of which you'll\nrecognize from earlier\nin the discussion, for instance,\nleptin signaling is disrupted.\nSo, the fat there's lots of body fat,\nbut even though that\nbody fat is secreting,\nthis hormone leptin in that\nsignal should shut down\nthe desire to eat.\nThe receptors to leptin in the\nbrain are totally screwed up.\nAnd so the signal to eat is there,\nbut the signal to stop\neating is not there.\nSo, again, you have an\naccelerator and a brake,\nand it's like, the accelerator\nhas always pushed down.\nSome of these brain\nstimulation approaches seem\nto be able to bypass some of that,\nand of course there all\nthe metabolic syndromes\nand the problems with having\nexcess levels of body fat,\nthings like insulin\nresistance, type two diabetes.\nI mean, as disturbing as is to here,\nthere are many individuals, actually,\nI know some who are so obese\nthat they start getting bodily sores.\nThey're not just bedsores,\nbut they have skin sores that\nare very disruptive to them.\nThey don't like having these sores.\nAnd in addition to that,\nthey can get peripheral neuropathies\nbecause of some of these metabolic issues.\nThey're not getting enough utilization\nof the nutrients in the tissue,\nbecause the way that insulin\nhas disrupted insulin singling,\nand they actually have\nto have certain portions\nof their limbs amputated, and\nyet they continue to overeat.\nSo, this is not an issue of\nself-control that can easily\nbe dealt with simply by\ntelling the person, look,\nyou have to stop eating\nor you're going to die,\nor you're going to have\nyour legs amputated.\nLike with anorexia,\nthere's a distortion in\nthe relationship to food,\nbut the homeostatic and the\nreward aspects are disrupted.\nSo, unlike anorexia,\nwhere it seems to be a\nhabit based mechanism\nwith bulimia and binge eating disorder,\nsomething deep within the\nneural circuitry is causing food\nto be hyper attractive\nand the break is off.\nSo, if you want to develop some empathy\nfor what these people are dealing with,\nconsider this, it's like driving a car,\nyou get onto a grade, maybe\na 10 or 15 degree grade,\nand you're heading down\nand you figure, well,\nyou'll just pump the brakes a little bit,\nbut there is no break, right?\nSo, you start going faster\nand faster and faster.\nAnd your only choice is\nto use the accelerator\njust to coach through it.\nThat's essentially what's happening\nto these neural circuits.\nSo, the work of Dr. Halpern and others,\nI think is really exciting.\nAnd even though it's highly invasive,\nI think is going to lead\nto not just some relief\nfor the patients that do get\nthat deep brain stimulation,\nbut also the identification\nof what sorts of receptors\nare present in those brain areas.\nThat could help.\nWhat that means is that once\nwe understand which brain areas\nare involved in disorder, and\nwe understand what receptors,\nthose brain areas express,\nthen there can start to be\nadditional interventions\nby way of non invasive treatments,\nthings like drug treatments,\ndo behavioral interventions\nwork for bulimia?\nIn some cases, yes,\nprovided that those interventions\nare done early enough.\nRegardless, behavioral interventions,\ncoupled with drug based interventions\nare always more effective\nthan either one alone.\nFortunately, there is a\ndecent size kit of drugs\nthat can help with bulimia.\nI mentioned some of them before things\nlike bupropion, Welbutrin\nsome of the serotonergic drugs\nand some of the drugs\nused to treat impulsivity.\nSo, we have on the one hand anorexia,\nwhich seems to be a disruption\nin habit and a coupling\nof unhealthy habits in this case,\nfood restriction to the reward pathway.\nAnd on the flip side,\nwe have binge eating disorder and bulimia\nwhere a very unhealthy\nhabit of gorging oneself\nwith food sometimes followed by purging,\nis not necessarily coupled to reward.\nThey feel terrible when\nthey do that, right?\nThe anorexic feels great about restricting\ntheir food intake.\nThey feel like they're\nwinning some sort of game.\nThe circuitry is flipped somehow that way.\nWith bulimia they feel\nhorrible about the fact\nthat they're bingeing,\nthere's immense shame.\nThey can't control themselves.\nThe reward is set up before the behavior,\nthe reward is set up\nin drawing them to food\nand in making food look like something\nthat's incredibly appetizing\nand there's no impulse break.\nThere's no way for them to\nstop that kind of behavior.\nSo, really kind of troubling\nthing to think about.\nIn either case,\nI think for those of\nus that know anorexics\nor have observed anorexia,\nit's so hard to see\nsomebody starved themselves\nto near death or to death.\nWhat more could be disturbing?\nWell, equally disturbing is\nsomebody who has an abundance\nof food and is gorging themselves,\nand then feels terrible about it.\nSo, these are heavy topics.\nThese are topics that\nfrankly no one really wants\nto talk about unless they\nknow someone who is suffering\nfrom them, or they\nthemselves suffer from them.\nWhat I've tried to do today\nis try and give you a window\ninto what really underlies these things\nthat we call eating disorders.\nI hope I've done that at the level\nof biology neurocircuitry\nmechanism endocrinology,\nand some of the psychology,\nas with any episode of this podcast.\nBut especially in this\nmonth where we're talking\nabout mental health issues\nand mental health disorders,\nbehavioral disorders, there's\nno way that I can exhaustively\ncover all the different\nforms of treatment.\nYou have the modely approach,\nyou've got all these different\napproaches to depression,\ninto anorexia, et cetera.\nWhat I've tried to do\nis give you a framework.\nAnd in doing that,\nI've tried to give you a\nframework of understanding\nthat also applies to this question.\nThat's I think equally\nimportant and goes alongside\nthe treatment of eating disorders\nis what in the world is healthy eating.\nWhat in the world is a\nhealthy relationship to food.\nI like to think that I have a\nhealthy relationship to food.\nI know the foods I like.\nI enjoy them.\nThey're 10 or 15 foods in\nparticular that I liked very much.\nI've mentioned a few of\nthem on the podcast before,\nand I was sort of amused,\nsurprised and perplexed as to why.\nFor instance, I do enjoy eating\nbutter, not in huge amounts,\nbut I do like butter.\nSo, that seemed to be pretty\ntriggering for folks out there.\nA small selection of people\ndecided that the ingestion\nof butter was a health concern.\nLook to me,\ningesting butter in small\nquantities is something\nthat I'm comfortable with.\nAnd my blood lipid profiles feel good.\nThey look good to me.\nFor other people that\nmight not be the case.\nFor some people.\nThe idea of eating an\nanimal-based food is probably\nso repulsive that it actually\ncan make them feel physically sick.\nAnd I think that we should\nbe aware that that kind\nof mental phenotype exists.\nI'm not calling it a pathology\nfor other people like myself,\nthings like butter and meat feel healthy.\nNow, what quantities?\nWell, I enjoy eating very much.\nI'm not shy about this.\nI've talked about on the\npodcast before, I enjoy eating.\nSome people have a very\ncomplicated relationship to food.\nThey don't think of it as nourishment.\nThey don't enjoy it socially.\nIt's a stressful thing for them based\non their personal history,\nor maybe just general anxiety around food.\nAnd I hope that in sharing\nthis information about the fact\nthat anytime we approach food,\nthese neurons in our hype,\nin the arcuate area of our\nhypothalamus actually increase\nour levels of anxiety.\nThis is related to that\npoint that Dr. Halpern made,\nwhich was that from an\nevolutionary standpoint,\nit is advantageous to ingest as much food\nas often as possible,\nas quickly as possible.\nWe now know that to not be\nhealthy in this age of abundance,\nwhere calories are essentially everywhere.\nAnd yet a lot of people\nfeel anxious in anticipation\nof a meal.\nWhat could be useful to them?\nWell, whether or not they have\nan eating disorder or not.\nIt's very clear that developing\nmethods to calm oneself\nin the presence of any anxiety\nor fear inducing stimulus\ncan be beneficial.\nI've talked about some of these\nepisodes related to stress,\nthings like the physiological\nside to inhale through\nthe nose and a long exhale,\nthings like mindfulness\nmeditation certainly can help.\nThere are data, a lot of\nstudies out there showing\nthat meditation practice\ncan help people deal\nwith eating related anxiety and disorders.\nI think as a general rule,\ntrying to avoid approaching\na meal or sitting down\nto eat in an anxious state\nis probably a good idea,\nbut let's be realistic.\nHow often can we do that?\nI think most of us are\ngoing to have circumstances\nwhere we're rushing around\ntrying to just eat before we head\nout or get to a meal.\nAnd then we sit down and\nwe find ourselves eating.\nThis is one of the first\ntimes in human evolution\nwhere we mostly eat out of\na desire to consume food,\nnot out of a need for food.\nMost everybody could\ngo a fairly long period\nof time, just ingesting\nwater and electrolytes.\nAnd not that I'm\nsuggesting people do that,\nbut let's face it.\nWe largely eat nowadays\nbecause of a desire to eat,\nnot a need to eat,\nand yet we need to eat on\na fairly regular basis.\nAnd so no topic is more complicated\nand nuanced than food and nutrition.\nAnd in particular, as it\nrelates to eating disorders.\nSo, the major takeaways today are,\nwe should all be asking the question,\nwhat is healthy eating for us?\nHow do we develop a relationship\nto food that we can enjoy\nfood, hopefully both socially\nand on our own, but\nthat we are not neurotic\nand compulsive about it.\nFor those of you that intermittent fast,\nthis also applies, right?\nWhat, you know, God forbid,\nif you eat 30 minutes before\nyour eating window starts,\nwhat does that mean?\nIf it means something catastrophic,\ndo you have an eating disorder?\nI don't know.\nMaybe you have an anxiety disorder,\nthat's for you to explore.\nIf you don't manage to\neat five meals a day\nand that's your obsession.\nWell, then, you know,\nthe same thing applies.\nThese are questions that\nwe can all ask ourselves.\nToday, we focus on the extremes\nof food related behaviors\nthat really qualify as genuine disorders.\nThey are in the psychiatric\nmanuals and they are diagnosable\nand they are serious health concerns.\nThey're not just mentally\ntroubling and concerning\nfor the people suffering from them\nand the people around them,\nbut they are genuine health concerns,\njust want to reiterate,\nthat interaction nervosa is\nthe most deadly psychiatric\ndisorder by a huge margin.\nAnd if you look\nstatistically at the number\nof people with eating\ndisorders and that die\nof eating disorders,\nit's not far off from the number of people\nthat die from automobile accidents.\nI know that that sounds\nlike a ridiculous number,\nbut you can look this up.\nThis is particularly true in\ncertain countries, why that is,\nwe don't know, but again,\nthis is not a new phenomenon.\nThis is not just related\nto body image issues\nthat are created through social media.\nAnd as a final point on that,\nmany of you are probably asking\nwhat about plastic surgery?\nWhat about all the steps that\npeople are going through?\nExcuse me, to preen themselves\nand change themselves.\nAre people addicted to plastic surgery?\nIs that a form of body dysmorphia?\nAnd indeed it is.\nAnd so we will do an\nepisode on exercise related\nand plastic surgery\nrelated body dysmorphia.\nI think there is very little\nquestion that those types\nof disorders are clearly\nrelated to what we're observing\nin social media and in media,\nthat this shift of, for\ninstance, action heroes.\nIf you look at action heroes in the '80s,\nthere were very few men\nthat were very large.\nYou had your terminate,\nyou had your stallone's\nin your shorts and eggers\nand a few others, but the\nmen in movies tended to be,\nif they were muscular,\nthey were far more\nsvelte than they are now.\nThere's this kind of, there's a,\nliterally a hypertrophy of the imagery.\nAnd likewise there's been hypertrophy\nof the female body shape.\nAs it's portrayed in the media.\nThere are body dysmorphia that are related\nto those types of things.\nAnd that relate to things\nlike plastic surgery,\nsteroid abuse, diet,\ndrug abuse, and so on.\nDefinitely important to\nthink about and consider,\nand definitely deserving\nof its own episode.\nYou've learned a lot\nof neuroscience today.\nI hope that was useful in\nthinking about these disorders\nand in thinking about\nother aspects of feeding\nand motivated behaviors,\nI would love for you\nto take away this model\nthat was handed off to me,\nthat I think is so powerful for thinking\nabout all sorts of\nthings, not just eating,\nbut all kinds of behaviors and perceptions\nthat you have one box for what you think,\none box for what you do\nand what is intervening between those?\nWhy is it that you can know\nbetter and not do better?\nWell it's because you also have to cope\nwith the subconscious\nhomeostatic processes\nand reward processes.\nAnd those oftentimes\ncan be disrupted in ways\nthat we find ourselves doing\nthings that are not good\nfor us or not good for other people.\nBut fortunately, there is this great gift,\nwhich is that knowledge\nof knowledge can allow you\nto do better without question.\nAnd that knowledge of knowledge\nallowing you to do better\nover time leads to this\nincredible phenomenon\ncalled neuroplasticity, which\nessentially is translated\ninto doing better over time.\nEven if difficult eventually\nmakes doing better reflexive.\nIf you're enjoying
