    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n- I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday I have the pleasure of introducing\nDr. Robert Sapolsky.\nDr. Sapolsky is a Professor of Biology\nand Neurosurgery at Stanford University.\nHis laboratory has worked on\na large variety of topics,\nincluding stress, hormones,\nincluding testosterone and estrogen,\nand how the different members\nof a given species interact\naccording to factors like hormones,\nhierarchy within primate troops,\nand how things like stress, reproduction\nand competition impact behavior.\nOne of the things that\nmakes Dr. Sapolsky's work\nso unique is that it combines\nelements from primatology,\nincluding field studies\nwith human behavior,\nin essence trying to unveil how\nhumans as old world primates\nare controlled by different\nelements of our biology\nas well as our psychology.\nDr. Sapolsky is also a prolific\nauthor of popular books,\nsuch as \"Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers\",\n\"The Trouble with Testosterone\",\nand \"Behave: The Biology of\nHumans at Our Best and Worst\".\nDuring the course of our discussion today,\nRobert also revealed to me\nthat he is close to completing\na new book entitled,\n\"Determined: The Science\nof Life Without Freewill.\"\nAnd indeed we discuss the science of life\nwithout freewill during this episode.\nWe also discuss stress and\nhow best to control stress\nand how stress controls us at both,\nconscious and subconscious levels.\nWe talk about testosterone and estrogen\nand hormone replacement therapy\nand how those impact\nour mind, our psychology\nand our interactions with others.\nAs with any discussion with Dr. Sapolsky,\nwe learn about scientific mechanisms\nthat make us who we are.\nAnd today we also discuss tools\nand how we can leverage\nthose scientific mechanisms\nin order to be better\nversions of ourselves.\nI should mention that\nunlike most guest interviews\non the Huberman Lab podcast,\nthis one had to be carried out remotely\ndue to various constraints,\nso you may hear the\noccasional audio artifact,\nplease excuse that.\nWe felt that the value of a\nconversation with Dr. Sapolsky\nwas well-worth those\nminor, minor glitches.\nAnd indeed the information\nthat he delivers us\nis tremendously valuable, interesting,\nand in many cases actionable as well.\nBefore we begin, I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part of my desire\nand effort to bring zero\ncost to consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA,\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolute highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers from Stanford,\nand everything about the\ndesign of the sunglasses\nand eyeglasses was created\nwith performance in mind.\nThere are several things I like\nabout ROKA glasses so much.\nOne of them is that the aesthetic\nof the glasses is great.\nUnlike a lot of performance\nglasses out there\nthat you can wear while swimming\nand running but also indoors,\nthese glasses don't make\nyou look like a cyborg.\nThe aesthetic of them is really terrific,\nand they have a lot of\ndifferent styles to select from.\nIn addition to that, the\nquality of the lenses\non both the sunglasses\nand eyeglasses are superb.\nThe optical clarity is great,\nyou can move from brightly\nlit areas to shadowed areas,\nand you don't get any degradation\nin the quality of the visual image.\nAnd that's absolutely essential.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to roka.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's ROKA.com and enter the\ncode Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer\nin getting regular blood work done.\nAnd now with the advent\nof quality DNA tests,\nyou can get a lot of\ninformation about your genetics\nand how that also impacts your immediate\nand long-term health.\nThe reason I'm such a fan of\ngetting blood work done is\nthat it is really the\nonly way to understand\nwhat's going on in your system at a level\nthat can really inform your decisions\nabout your immediate and long-term health.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood and DNA tests, however,\nis that you get numbers\nback about your hormones\nand your metabolic factors, etc.,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they have\na very easy to use dashboard\nthat gives you that information,\nand then gives you some\nsuggestions and directives\nabout things you could\nchange about your nutrition,\nabout your exercise and\nother lifestyle factors\nthat can help you move those\nnumbers in the direction\nthat's best for you and for your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to InsideTracker.com/Huberman\nto get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker plans,\njust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Belcampo.\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass-fed\nand finished certified humane meats.\nI eat meat about once a day,\nin general my lunch or my\nbreakfast consists of some meat,\nand that meat has to be\nof very high-quality,\nand generally I'll eat\nsome vegetable as well.\nAnd then I tend to eat pastas and rice\nand things of that sort later\nin the day or in the evening\nin order to facilitate\nthe transition to sleep.\nSo I'm eating meat about once a day,\nand I always insist\nthat the meat that I eat\nbe of the very highest quality\nand that the animals were\nraised and maintained humanely.\nWhile conventionally raised\nanimals are confined to feedlots\nand eat a diet of inflammatory grains,\nBelcampo's animals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses resulting in meat\nthat's higher in nutrients\nand healthy fats.\nIn addition, they raise\ntheir animals in a way\nthat's not just better for our health,\nbut also has a positive\nimpact on the environment.\nThey practice regenerative agriculture,\nwhich means the meat is climate positive\nand carbon negative.\nSo you can feel good\nabout what you're eating\nat the environmental level\nand for sake of your health.\nYou can order Belcampo's\nsustainably raised meats\nto be delivered to you\nby using my code Huberman\nat Belcampo.com/Huberman and\nentering my code Huberman\nto get 20% off your first time order.\nI'm partial to the ribeyes\nor the New York steaks,\nso on one day I might have a ribeye,\nthe next day I might\nhave a New York steak,\nI also really like the meatballs,\nI'm a particular fan of the meatballs.\nSo, again, that's Belcampo.com/Huberman\nand enter the code Huberman\nat checkout to get 20% off your order.\nAnd now without further ado,\nmy conversation with Dr. Robert Sapolsky.\nGreat, well, thank you so much,\nRobert, for joining us today.\nI've been looking forward\nto this for a very long time\nand I appreciate it.\n- Oh yes, glad to be here.\n- There is an enormous range of topics\nthat we could drill into,\nbut just to start off,\nI want to return to a topic that is\nnear and dear to your\nheart, which is stress.\nAnd one of the questions\nthat I get most commonly is,\nwhat is the difference between\nshort and long-term stress\nin terms of their benefits\nand their drawbacks?\nAnd the reason I say benefits is that,\nobviously stress and the stress\nresponse can keep us alive,\nbut stress, of course, can\nalso sharpen our mental acuity\nand things of that sort.\nSo how should we conceptualize stress\nand how should we conceptualize stress\nin the short-term and in the long-term?\n- Well, basically sort of two\ngraphs that one would draw.\nThe first one is just all\nsorts of beneficial effects\nof stress short-term,\nand then once we get into chronicity,\nit's just downhill from there.\nShort-term because it saves\nyou from the predator,\nshort-term because you're\ngiving a presentation\nand you think more clearly\nor your focus is better,\nall sorts of aspects of that.\nAnd what then winds up\nbeing an argument is,\nhow long does it take to go\nfrom short-term to long-term?\nAnd that's somewhat arbitrary,\nbut the sorts of chronic stressors\nthat most people deal\nwith are just undeniably\nin the chronic range, like\nhaving spent the last 20 years,\ndaily traffic jams or abusive\nboss or some such thing.\nThe other curve that's sort\nof perpendicular to this\nis dealing with the fact\nthat sometimes stress is a great thing.\nLike our goal is not to\ncure people of stress\nbecause if it's a right kind, we love it.\nWe pay good money to be stressed that way\nby a scary movie or a rollercoaster ride.\nWhat you wind up seeing is\nwhen it's the right amount of stress,\nit's what we call stimulation.\nAnd the basic curve there is,\nhere is an optimal level of\nstimulation and too little,\nand function goes down with\nwhat we would call boredom,\nand too much and function goes down\nwith what we would call stress.\nAnd the optimum is what all of us aim for.\n- In terms of the benefits\nof stress in the short-term,\none thing that's really striking to me is,\nhow physiologically the stress response\nlooks so much like the excitement response\nto a positive event.\nAnd we can speculate that\nthe fundamental difference\nbetween short-term stress\nand short-term excitement\nis some neuromodulator like\ndopamine or something like that.\nBut is there anything else that we know\nabout the biology that reveals to us?\nWhat really creates this\nthing we call valence\nthat an experience can be\nterrible or feel awful,\nor it can feel wonderful,\nexhilarating depending on\nthis somewhat subjective\nfeature we call valence?\nDo we know what valence\nis or where it resides?\n- On a really mechanical level,\nif you're in a circumstance\nthat is requiring\nthat your heart races and\nyou're breathing as fast\nand you're using your\nmuscles and some such thing,\nyou're going to to be\nhaving roughly the same\nbrain activation profile,\nwhether this is for something wonderful\nor something terrible with\nthe one exception being\nthat if the amygdala is\npart of the activation,\nthis is something that's going\nto be counting as adverse.\nWhether that's the circumstance,\nan adverse circumstance\nrecruiting the amygdala into it,\nand how much it's the\namygdala being involved,\nbiases you towards interpreting\nit as even more awful.\nThe amygdala in some ways\nis kind of the checkpoint\nas to whether we're talking\nabout excitement or terror.\n- Let's use the amygdala\nas a transition point\nto another topic that you've\nspent many years working on\nand thinking about, which is testosterone\nand other sex steroid hormones.\nI heard you say once before that\namong all the brain areas\nthat bind testosterone,\nthat where testosterone\ncan park and create effects\nthat the amygdala is among\nthe most chockablock full\nof these parking spots,\nthese receptors.\nI realize there's a lot here,\nbut how should we think\nabout the role of\ntestosterone in the amygdala\ngiven that the engagement of\nthe amygdala is fundamental\nin this transition point\nbetween a exhilarating,\npositive response and a\nnegative stressful response?\nOr maybe just broadly,\nhow should we think about testosterone\nand its effects on the brain?\n- And pertinent to the transition from\nwhether this is a stressor\nthat's evoking fear\nor revoking aggression in\nterms of that continuum,\nalso because the amygdala\nis in the center of all\nfour points on those axes.\nBasically, almost everybody out there\nhas a completely wrong idea\nas to what testosterone does,\nwhich is testosterone makes you aggressive\nbecause males, virtually\nevery species out there\nhave more testosterone\nand a more aggressive\nand seasonal measures\nhave testosterone surging\nat the time of year, they're\npunching it out over territory.\nAnd you take testosterone\nout of the picture,\nyou castrate any mammal\nout there, including us,\nand levels of aggression will go down.\nAnd the easy thing then tends to conclude\nthat testosterone causes aggression.\nAnd the reality is testosterone\ndoes no such thing,\nit doesn't cause aggression.\nAnd you can see this both\nbehaviorally and in the amygdala.\nWhat does testosterone do?\nIt lowers the threshold\nfor the sort of things\nthat would normally provoke\nyou into being [mumbles]\nso that it happens more easily.\nIt makes systems that are\nalready turned on, turn on louder\nrather than turning on aggressive\nmusic or some such thing.\nWhat does that look like behaviorally?\nYou take five male\nmonkeys, put them together,\nthey form a dominance hierarchy.\nNumber one is great,\nnumber five is miserable,\nnumber three is right in between.\nNow take number three\nand shoot the guy up\nwith tons of testosterone\nand he's going to be\ninvolved in more fights.\nAha, testosterone uniformly\ncauses aggression,\nbut you look closely and\nthere's a pattern to it,\nis number three now\nchallenging numbers two and one\nfor their place in the hierarchy.\nAbsolutely not, he is brown-nosing them\nexactly as much as he used to.\nWhat's going on is he's\njust a miserable terror\nto poor number four and five.\nAnd in that case, what\ntestosterone is doing\nis amplifying the preexisting\npatterns of aggression.\nAmplifying the social learning,\nthat's where it'd gone into there.\nNow on sort of the more reductive level,\nso how does that translate\ninto the amygdala?\nDoes testosterone make amygdaloid neurons\nhave action potentials?\nDoes it cause those\nneurons to suddenly speak\nabout fear and aggression spontaneously?\nAbsolutely not.\nWhat they do is,\nif the amygdala is\nalready being stimulated,\nit increases the rate of neuronal firing.\nWhat its worth?\nIt shortens after-hyperpolarizations.\nSo the theme there exactly is,\nit's not creating your aggression,\nit's just upping the volume of\nwhatever aggression is already there.\nAnd once you factor that in,\nit's impossible to say anything\nabout what testosterone does\noutside the context of what\ntestosterone related behaviors,\nhow they get treated [laughs]\nin your social settings.\n- Mm-hmm, yeah.\nAnd in terms of status\nand the relationship\nbetween individuals, either\nnonhuman primates or humans,\ncan we say that testosterone\nand levels of testosterone?\nOr I should say, can we say\nthat relative levels of\ntestosterone between individuals\nis correlated to status\nwithin the hierarchy?\n- Yes, but in a way that winds up\nbeing totally uninteresting.\nLike you go back on\nwhatever number of decades,\nthe endocrinology texts,\nand there were two totally\nreliable findings in there.\nLet's see, I have a dog in here that's-\n- Oh, good, we like dogs at\nthe Huberman Lab podcast.\n- Oh, okay, it is jingling with that.\n- They are welcome, they are\nabsolutely welcome, yeah.\n- And there'd be two truisms,\nwhich is higher levels of testosterone\npredict higher levels of aggression\nin humans and other animals.\nHigher levels of testosterone\npredict higher levels of sexual activity.\nWhoa, testosterone causing both,\nand the correlation is there.\nAnd when you look closely, we've\ngot cause and effect stuff,\nsexual behavior raises\ntestosterone levels,\naggression raises testosterone levels.\nYour levels before had\nwere barely predictive\nof what's going to happen,\nso it's a response rather than a cause.\nWhen you look at that though\nin terms of making sense\nof individual differences,\nthey don't matter a whole lot.\nYou can spend an entire career\non the social circumstances\nthat produce 3.5% more\ntestosterone in the circulation,\nand expect to see all sorts\nof interesting implications.\nAnd that's not really the case,\nit's somewhat of a yes or no modulator\nof the much more subtle social\nstuff that's already there.\n- Very interesting.\nI think that there are\na lot of misconceptions\nabout human biology, but\ntestosterone seems to be one area\nwhere at least from what I\ncan find on the internet,\nit's sort of at the peak\nof misunderstanding.\nMaybe we could just ask\na few more questions\nabout testosterone and sexual behavior\nbecause there's an interesting story there\nabout castration versus non-castration\nand the causality, again.\nBut before you address that,\nI just want to highlight\nsomething that you said\nthat I think is so vital,\nwhich is that behaviors,\nsuch as aggressive behaviors\nand sexual behaviors\ncan actually increase testosterone.\nDid I hear that correctly?\n- Yeah.\n- And the reverse is sort of\ntrue, but not in a causal way.\nIs that right?\n- The opposite direction\nof the causality, yeah.\n- Yeah, yeah, so if I were to increase\nsomebody's testosterone by 30%,\nmale or female doesn't matter,\ntheir sexual behavior\nmay or may not change.\n- Essentially zero effect at all.\nYour brain is not that sensitive\nto fluctuations in testosterone levels.\nIn terms of things like aggression,\nraising testosterone,\nthis is a great footnote.\nIf you have the right type of\nwilling to die on the trenches\ndevotion sort of thing,\nwatching your favorite team play a sport\nwill raise your testosterone levels\nas you sit there with the\npotato chips in your armchair.\nSo it's not the physicality of aggression,\nit's the psychological framing of it.\nSo, yeah, testosterone\nis not causing that.\nAnd a great way to appreciate that is,\nokay, so you had all these testosterone\nsexual behavior correlations,\nand you do the definitive\nendocrine intervention,\nwhich is you do a subtraction study,\nyou've removed the testes.\nAnd as I said before, levels\nof sexual behavior goes down.\nGood, we've just shown\nthat testosterone is\nsomehow have caused it.\nCritically they go down,\nbut not down to zero,\nwhether you are a rat or a\nmonkey or a human, whatever.\nAnd what predicts how much residual\nsexual behavior is there,\nhow much sexual behavior\nthere was before castration?\nWhat that's telling you is by then\nthat's behavior that's being\ncarried by social learning\nand context rather than by the hormone,\nexact same thing with aggression.\nDrops after castration,\ndoesn't go to zero,\nthe more prior history of it,\nthe more it just keeps\ncoasting along on its own\neven without testosterone.\n- Very interesting.\nCan we say that there is an exception\nin terms of the early\norganizing effects of hormones?\nLike, for instance, if a\ndeveloping animal is deprived of\na testosterone or estrogen\nor aromatized testosterone into estrogen,\nthere's a whole story there is, you know.\nBut then I could imagine that\nthe circuits of the brain\nthat are responsible for\ninitiating sexual behavior\nin the first place might not emerge,\nand therefore not be sensitive\nto the testosterone later in life.\nIs that right?\nOkay.\n- Yeah, exactly.\nAnd a great way of seeing that\nis this totally nutty biological factoid,\nwhich is the second to\nfourth digit ratio enhanced.\n- Oh yeah.\n- Totally obscure thing, the\nratio of one to the other\nin some way reflects\nlevels of testosterone,\nandrogen exposure during fetal life.\nAnd I can't remember which\nway it goes and it's minuscule\nand you need a thousand\npeople in your sample size\nto be able to see anything,\nbut you see it in other primates,\nit's already there in fetal\nsonograms, all of that.\nSo that's a readout of subtle differences\nin prenatal exposure,\nand that winds up being a\npredictor of a whole range of\nsort of stuff in adult behavior.\nSo, yeah, at the fetal end,\nwhen you're still building everything,\ntestosterone and the amount of that\nis making a huge difference.\nBy the time you're an adult,\nit's just somewhat of\nan old and a non-signal.\n- Yeah, I have a confession,\nwhich is that I was a\nmaster's student at Berkeley\nin Marc Breedlove's arena, so\nI'm an author on that paper,\nalthough I'm deep within the author line,\nand you got the description\nof it exactly right\nthat it's the D2, the index\nfinger to the ring finger ratio\nis more similar in females\nthan it is in males.\nIn males, the index finger\ntends to be shorter.\nAnd for people out there\nwho are listening to this\nwho are now freaking out or measuring,\nthat there is a proper way\nto measure this, which is,\neyeballing it doesn't work all the time\nunless at the extremes.\nAnd there's some very\ninteresting stories there.\nIt actually has been replicated\nno fewer than five times,\nMarc Breedlove tells me.\nBut yes, in terms of these\nearly organizing effects,\nthose seem very robust in most studies.\nThese later effects are\nsort of activation of\nneural circuits by hormones.\nI'm absolutely fascinated by this.\nAnd I do have a couple other questions,\nwhich is, we normally associate\ntestosterone with males,\nbut of course, females\nmake testosterone as well\nfrom the adrenals and\npresumably elsewhere too.\nI'm guessing if we looked hard enough,\nwe'd probably find that\nthere were other sources\nof androgens in females.\nCan we say\nthat these general contours\nof effects on aggression\nalso pertain to females?\nAnd I suppose I should ask in particular\nabout female-female aggression,\nwhich does exist in many species,\nfemale-male agregression as\nwell as maternal aggression,\nwhich is a robust aspect of\nour evolution, of course,\nthat the mother will,\nan angry mother animal\nof any kind protecting her\nyoung is truly dangerous,\nin the best sense of the word.\n- And that type of post-parturition,\nperiod after birth aggression\nis all about estrogen,\nprogesterone, those sorts of things.\nFemale aggression, the rest of the time\nhas testosterone as a major\nplayer at a much lower level\non the average.\nOn the average, one always has to say,\nbut it's basically the same punchlines.\nIn females, the lower levels\nof testosterone are essential\nfor typical levels of\naggression and sexual behavior.\nNonetheless, they're not causing it,\nit's not sensitive to small\nindividual differences.\nSame exact thing.\nYou can get way over-impressed\nwith the importance of\nandrogens in females\njust as readily as in males.\n- So in line with that,\nhow should we conceptualize testosterone?\nI realize there isn't a single sentence\nthat can capture a\nhormone in all its effects\nbecause hormones have\nso many different slow\nand fast effects on the brain,\non other glands on their own,\non the very glands that produce them.\nBut as I've heard you talk\nabout testosterone today\nand over the years, I\nstart to get the impression\nthat as the most misunderstood molecule\n[laughs] in human health in the universe,\nit's clearly doing\nsomething very powerful.\nIt's shifting the way that\ncertain neural circuits work,\nadjusting the gain on the\namygdala, as you described,\nand certainly other things as well.\nIs there any truism\nabout testosterone like,\nand its relationship to effort\nor its relationship to resilience,\nand in a way that maybe will\nhelp me and other people\nto sort of think about how\nto think about testosterone?\n- Yeah.\nMaybe three separate answers to that.\nThe first one is, I think\nit's a fair summary to think\nthat when it comes to\nmotivated strong behaviors,\nwhat testosterone does is make you\nmore of whatever you already are.\nAnd that to me, sexual arousal,\nlibido, aggressiveness,\nspontaneous aggression,\nreactive aggression, things of that sort.\nIt's upping the volume of things\nthat are already strongly there.\nSecond way to think about it is,\nwell, here's like my favorite\nfinding about testosterone.\nAnd this was some wonderful\nwork by a guy, John Wingfield,\nwho's one of the best behavioral\nendocrinologists out there.\nAnd about 20 years ago he\nformulated what was called\nThe Challenge Hypothesis\nof Testosterone in Action.\nWhat does testosterone do?\nTestosterone is what you secrete\nwhen your status is being challenged,\nand it makes it more likely that you'll do\nthe behaviors needed to\nhold onto your status.\nOkay, so that's totally\nboringly straightforward\nif you are a baboon.\nIf somebody is challenging your high rank,\nthe appropriate response on your part\nis going to be aggression.\nAll right, so we've just got\nin through the back door,\ntestosterone and aggression, again.\nBut then you get to humans,\nand humans have lots of\ndifferent ways of achieving\nor maintaining status.\nAnd all you need to do is go to like some\nfancy private school's annual auction,\nand you will see all these\nhalf-drunk alpha males\ncompeting to see who can\ngive the most money away\nas a show of conspicuous like\nproperty that they have.\nAnd in a setting like that, I mean,\nI haven't been able to take urine samples,\nif there's times, unfortunately,\nbut that shows the flip side of it.\nIf you have a species\nthat hands out status\nin a very different sort of way,\ntestosterone is going to boost that also.\nOkay, so that generates a\ntotally nutty prediction.\nWow, take people in a circumstance,\nsay playing an economic game\nwhere you get status by being trustworthy\nand being generous in your\ninteractions with the game.\nIf you give people testosterone,\ndoes that make them more generous?\nAnd that's absolutely the case.\nTotally cool finding.\nI'm showing you, I don't know,\nbasically if you took a\nwhole bunch of Buddhist monks\nand shot them up with testosterone,\nthey'd get all competitive with each other\nas to who could do the most\nrandom acts of kindness.\nAnd if we have a societal\nproblem with too much aggression,\nthe first culprit to look\nat is not testosterone,\nthe first to look at is\nthat we hand out so much\ndamn elevated status\nfor aggression in so many circumstances.\nSo I find that finding to be fantastic.\nThird thing about\nsubtlety of testosterone.\nOkay, so like some subtler\nbehavioral effects,\nyou give testosterone to people\nand they become more confident,\nthey become more self-confident.\nWell, that's good, people pay to take\nall sorts of nonsensical self-help courses\nthat will boost your self-esteem.\nAnd that's a good thing\nunless testosterone\nmakes you more confident,\nthat is inaccurate,\nand you're more likely to\nbarrel into wrong decisions.\nWhat's shown in economic game\nplay is that testosterone\nby making you more confident\nmakes you less cooperative\nbecause who needs to cooperate\nbecause I'm on top of this all on my own.\nTestosterone makes people\ncocky and impulsive.\nAnd that might be great in one setting,\nbut if and the other is,\nyou're absolutely sure your army is to\nget over on the other\ncountry in three days.\nSo hell, let's start World War I,\nand you get a big surprise out of it.\nTestosterone altering\nrisk assessment beforehand\nprobably played a big role in\nthat kind of miscalculation.\n- Super-interesting.\nI always think about testosterone\nand dopamine being close\ncousins in the brain,\nnot just because of their relationship\nthrough the pituitary and hypothalamus.\nThat, of course, but also because\nof dopamine's salient role\nin creating this bias\ntowards exteroception.\nWhen somebody takes a drug,\nwith it increases dopamine,\nor they're chockablock full of dopamine.\nThey tend, I want to highlight 'tend'\nbecause this is, I'm\nreally generalizing here,\nbut they tend to focus on outward goals,\nthings beyond the\nboundaries of their skin.\nAnd testosterone seems\nto do a bit of the same,\nit tends to put us into a similar mode of\nperceiving the outside world in ways\nthat we're asking questions like,\nhow do I relate to this\nother of my species?\nHow do I relate to these goals?\nIs there anything that we can\ndo to better conceptualize\nthe relationship between testosterone\nand dopamine and motivation?\nOr would that just take\nus down the alleyways of,\nof neural pathways and the hypothalamus?\nWhich is fine too.\n- Well, I think it's got lots to do with\nsort of this massive\nrevisionism about dopamine.\nEveryone, since the pharaohs\ngot brought up being taught\nthat dopamine is about\npleasure and reward.\nIt turns out it isn't, it's\nabout anticipation of reward,\nand it's about generating the motivation,\nthe goal-directed behavior\nneeded to go get that reward.\nAnd before you know it, you're\nusing like elevated dopamine,\nyour entire life to motivate you to do\nwhatever is going to get\nyou like entry into heaven\nafter-life kind of, it's\ndoing that sort of thing.\nSo it's really about the motivation.\nAnd what testosterone\ndoes even in individuals\nwho are not aggressive and\nwhy testosterone replacement\nis often a very helpful\nthing for aging males is\nit increases energy, it\nincreases a sense of thereness,\na presence of alertness\nthat increases motivation.\nSo that's a whole aspect,\nwhich then takes us into\nis your motivation to get up and like go,\nhand out lots of soup in a soup\nkitchen for homeless people,\nor is it to get up and go\nethnically cleanse a village.\nIt's got much to do with\nwhat your makeup was\nbefore the testosterone got onboard.\nSo it's activating in an energetic sense,\ntestosterone within minutes\nincreases glucose uptake\ninto skeletal muscle.\nYou're just more awake\nand alert and all of that,\nand that has a lot to do\nwith what dopamine does.\nAnd as one might predict then,\ngetting just the right\nlevels of testosterone\ninfused into your bloodstream\nfeels great to lab rats.\nThey will lever press to\nget infused into the range\nthat optimizes dopamine release.\nSo there is, you are absolutely right,\nthey're deeply intertwined.\n- Yeah, such beautiful biology there.\nAnd I love the way you\nencapsulate their relationship.\nI want to ask about estrogen,\nwe don't hear about estrogen as often,\nand it's always\ninteresting to me now doing\nsome public facing education,\nthat testosterone is this\nvery controversial molecule,\njust to say it is almost\ncontroversial. [laughs]\n[Robert laughs]\nBut estrogen doesn't seem\nto hold the same controversial weight,\nand yet estrogen has a\nvery powerful effects\non both the animal brain\nand on the human brain\nof males and females.\nMen do not want their\nestrogen to go too low.\nTerrible things happen, they\nwill lose cognitive function,\nlibido can drop.\nSo men need estrogen as well,\nbut perhaps maybe we can put\nthe same filter on estrogen\nas we did on testosterone.\nAre there any general themes of estrogen\nthat people should be aware of\nor that you think that are\ngenerally misunderstood?\nIs it really all about\nfeelings and empathy\nand making us more sensitive?\nI sense not.\n- No, and it's once again\nvery context dependent.\nAnd if estrogen after giving\nbirth is playing a central role\nin you wanting to shred\nthe face of somebody\ngetting too close to your\nkittens kind of thing,\nwe know it's not just warm,\nfuzzy, empathic kind of stuff.\nEstrogen in lots of ways\ncould be summarized by,\nif you've got a choice in the matter\nbetween having a lot of estrogen\nin your bloodstream or not,\ngo for having a lot of estrogen.\nIt enhances cognition,\nexactly as you said,\nit stimulates neurogenesis\nin the hippocampus,\nit increases glucose and oxygen delivery,\nit protects you from dementia,\nit decreases inflammatory\noxidative damage to blood vessels,\nwhich is why it's good for protecting\nfrom cardiovascular disease\nin contrast to testosterone,\nwhich is making everyone\nof those things worse.\nThis springs up this\nminefield with a question,\nwhich is, so what about\npost-menopausal estrogen?\nAnd all sorts of lab studies\nwith non-human primates\nsuggested that you keep\nestrogen levels high\nafter a monkey's equivalent of menopause.\nAnd you're going to keep\nbrain health a lot better\nor decreasing the risk\nof dementia, stroke,\nevery such thing.\nEstrogen is a great\nantioxidant, all of that.\nSo in the 90s I think\nwhen Healy, I'm forgetting her name,\nbut when there was the first\nfemale head of the NIH,\nBernadine Healy set up this\nmassive prospective human study,\nwhat was going to be the\nbiggest one of all times,\nlooking at the pluses and minuses\nof post-menopausal estrogen.\nAnd tens of thousands of\nwomen, and this was...\nAnd they had to cut the study short\nbecause what they were seeing was,\nestrogen was not only\ndoing the normal bad stuff\nthat you expect in terms of\nsome decalcification stuff,\nbut it was increasing the risk\nof cardiovascular disease,\nand it was increasing the risk of stroke,\nand it was increasing\nthe risk of dementia.\nAnd this ground to a halt and everybody,\nthey stopped the study and front page news\nand everybody panned at that point.\nAnd nobody could make sense of it\nwho had been spending the\nlast 20 years studying\nthe exact same thing in primates\nand seeing all the protective effects.\nAnd the explanation turned\nout to be one of those things\nwhere like the law of\nunexpected consequences.\nOkay, menopause in women,\nit lasts different lengths of time,\nthat may be a factor that's going to come.\nYou know what, let's not start\ngiving our study subjects\nmore estrogen until they're\ntotally past menopause.\nAnd when you've got that\nlag time in between,\nyou shift all sorts of\nestrogen receptor patterns,\nand that's where all of\nthe bad effects come from.\n- Wow!\n- All of the monkey studies\nhad involved just maintaining\novulatory levels into the\npost-menopausal period.\nAnd you do that and you get great effects.\nEstrogen is one of the\ngreatest predictors of\nprotection from Alzheimer's\ndisease, all of that,\nbut it needs to be physiological.\nJust keep continuing what\nyour body has been doing\nfor a long time versus let\nthe whole thing shutdown\nand suddenly like try to\nfire up the coal stoves\nat the bottom of the\nbasement kind of thing,\nand get that going,\nthere you get utterly different outcomes.\nAnd that caused a lot of\nhuman health consequences\nwhen people suddenly decided that estrogen\nis in fact neurologically\nendangering post-menopausally.\n- Wow, that's fascinating.\nAnd I never thought that these\nsteroid hormone receptors\ncould by not binding estrogen,\nbeing devoid of estrogen\nbinding, I should say,\ncould then set off opposite\nbiochemical cascades.\nFascinating.\nI guess it raises the question\nabout testosterone replacement too,\nwhether or not people should\n[laughs] talk to their\ndoctor before too long.\nMen and women talk to your\nphysicians before too long\nto avoid these, whatever is\nhappening in these periods\nwhere there isn't sufficient\ntestosterone and/or estrogen.\nIt sounds like could\ncause longer-term problems\neven when therapies are introduced.\n- Two additional misery\nslash complications.\nSo, okay, you're trying to understand,\nyou look at women with a history\nwith or without post-menopausal\nestrogen replacement\nwhere it's done great.\nAnd you're seeing 20 years later,\nestrogen is a predictor of a\ndecreased risk of Alzheimer's.\nThen you got to start\ntrying to do the unpacking\nprospective type studies.\nHow much estrogen?\nAt which times?\nEstrogen is a catchall term\nfor a bunch of hormones,\nestrone, estradiol, estriol.\nHow much of each one of them?\nNatural or synthetic?\nGo try to figure all of that out.\nAnd the second complication is,\nit's often hard to say anything\nabout what estrogen does\noutside the context of\nwhat progesterone is doing.\nAnd often it's not the\nabsolute levels of either,\nit's the ratio of the two.\nThis is such a more\ncomplicated endocrine system\nthan testosterone.\nAnd because you have to\ngenerate dramatic cyclicity\nthat like no male hypothalamus\never has to dream off.\nIt's a much, much more complicated system,\nthus, it's a lot more\ncomplicated to understand,\nlet alone like figure out what\nthe ideal benefits are of it.\n- Yeah.\nI don't know what to\nmake of the literature on\ndropping rates of testosterone\nand endocrine disruptors.\nI was at Berkeley when Tyrone Hayes\npublished his data on these frogs\nthat were drinking water\nfrom various locations\nthroughout the United States,\nnot just in California,\nand seeing very severe\nendocrine disruption\nthrough blockade or,\nand of androgen receptors\nand all sorts of issues.\nAnd you hear this all the time now\nthat sperm counts are dropping,\nthat there are all these\nendocrine disruptors\nthat there's birth control in the water,\nin the drinking water.\nIt all starts to sound a little crazy,\nand yet I've also been fooled before by,\nI guess a good example would be,\nthere's a lot of crazy\nstuff in the world online\nabout all the terrible stuff\nin highly processed foods.\nAnd yet you've got very\nrespectable people,\nendocrinologists at UCSF\nlike Robert Lustig saying,\nyeah, a lot of these hidden sugars\nand these emulsifiers,\nthey're causing real problems.\nSo I've become more\nopen-minded about the question.\nAnd so, are we suffering\nfrom drops in sperm counts\nand testosterone and\nestrogen and fertility\nas a consequence of endocrine disruptors\nin the environments and food,\nor because of social reasons?\nIs there anything that\nwe can hang our hat on\nlike real data that you're confident in?\nOr is it just a mess?\n- No, the phenomenon does\nappear to be quite real.\nCross-sectional studies,\nhuman populations,\nor I still don't understand why this was\none of the first things\nthat Hayes spotted.\nDecreasing testicle size in crocodiles.\n[Andrew laughs]\nGo figure why that was\none of the first contributions to this.\nAnd I think the phenomenon\nis absolutely real.\nAnd what you're then left with\nis two classic challenges,\nwhich is this is correlated with\nsomething broad environmental toxins.\nWhich ones, how much, when, etc.?\nAnd the other one always\nbeing, well, okay,\ndropping is a dropping\nenough to make a difference.\nHow big of an effect is this?\nAnd those are where the\njuries are still out.\n- Yeah, it's an area that I know\nthere's a lot of interest in,\nand you've got groups of people\nwho won't touch a receipt at a store\nbecause of the BPAs that\nare on the inks of the...\nAnd then [laughs] you've got people\nwho don't care about those things.\nIt is a fascinating area.\nI hope that more biology\nwill be done there soon.\nI'd like to briefly return to stress.\nYou described a study once about two rats,\none running on a wheel voluntarily,\none who is basically\nstuck in a running wheel,\nand it's forced to run\nanytime, rat number one runs.\nSo in one case the rat is\nvoluntarily exercising. [laughs]\nAnd in the other case,\nthe rat is being forced\nto go to PE class, so to speak,\nbut really, and seeing\ndivergent effects on biology.\nAnd I'd like to just\ntouch into this and use it\nas kind of a case study for\nstress mitigation in general.\nI'm rather obsessed in our\ncolleague, David Spiegel,\nAssociate Chair of Psychiatry at Stanford\nis obsessed with this question of,\nhow humans can start to\nmitigate their own stress?\nWhat do you think about stress mitigation\nand what should we do as\nindividuals and as families\nand as a culture to try\nand encourage people\nto mitigate their stress, but in ways\nthat are not going to turn\nus into rat number two,\nwhere we're being forced\nto mitigate our own stress\nand therefore it becomes\nmore stressful. [laughs]\n- And what you see is, rat number one gets\nall the benefits of exercise.\nRat number two gets all the\ndownsides of severe stress\nwith the same exact muscle expenditure\nand movements going on.\nPerfectly yoked, great example\nthat it's the interpretation on your head.\nAnd I haven't kept up\nwith that literature,\nbut I'll bet you, rat number two\nis having a whole lot more\nactivity in its amygdala\nthan is rat number one.\nOkay, so stress mitigation.\nAnything I should say here\nI should preface with,\nI'm reasonably good at telling people\nwhat's going to happen if they\ndon't manage their stress,\nbut I'm terrible at actually\nlike managing stress\nor advising how to manage that.\nI'm much better with the\nbad news aspect of it.\nBut what you see is, by now\njust a classic literature,\nhalf a century old, sort of showing\nwhat are the building blocks of stress.\nNot, ooh, you step outside\nand you've been gored by an elephant,\nand can you grow from your experience?\nAnd what doesn't kill\nyou makes you stronger.\nIn that you could have a stress response,\nbut you're in the realm of the gray zone\nof ambiguous social\ninteractions, that sort of thing.\nSome people have massive stress responses,\nothers not at all, in between, enjoy it.\nLike what are the building blocks of,\nwhat makes psychological stress stressful?\nAnd the first one is exactly\nwhat is brought up by that running study.\nDo you have a sense of control?\nA sense of control makes\nstressors less stressful.\nAnd the running wheel shows\nthat or studies where you,\nyou lab rat or you\ncollege freshman volunteer\nhave been trained that\nby pressing a lever,\nyou're less likely to get a shock.\nAnd today you're at the\nlever they're working away\nand unbeknownst to you the\nlever has been turned off,\nand it has no effect on shock frequency,\nbut because you think\nyou have some control,\nyou have less of a stress response.\nIf you were a rat and doing\nthis day-in and day-out,\nyou're less likely to get an ulcer.\nSo a sense of control.\nAnd related to that is a\nsense of predictability.\nRat get shocked, human\ngets shocked, whatever,\nand the scenario either is\nthe shocks come now and then,\nor the shocks come now and then,\nand 10 seconds before a\nlittle warning light comes on.\nAnd when you get the warning light,\nthe shocks are distressful.\nYou got predictability\nbecause if you're not\ngetting warning lights,\nany second you could be a half second away\nfrom the next shock.\nYou get a warning light,\nand you know that if there isn't one,\nyou've got at least 10\nseconds worth of relaxation.\nYou know what's coming,\nyou can prepare your coping responses,\nand best of all afterward you\nknow when you're finally safe,\nwhen you can recover from it.\nAnd that's enormously protective.\nOthers outlet for frustration,\nyou take a rat who is getting shocked,\nand if it could run on a running wheel,\nthat's a protective thing,\nthat's doing it voluntarily.\nIf you've got a rat and he\ncan gnaw on a bar of wood,\na stressor is less stressful.\nUnfortunately, if you have\na rat or primate or human\nand they're stressed, the\nability to aggressively dump on\nsomebody smaller and weaker\nalso reduces the stress response.\nAnd the fact that displacement\naggression reduces stress\naccounts for a huge percent\ntriggers like unhappiness.\nSo all of those are variables,\nget social support as well.\nThat's a good one.\nInterpreting circumstances is being\ngood news rather than bad.\nHurray, so you've got this very simple\nsort of like take home recipe of go out\nand get as much control\nand as much predictability\nand as many outlets and as much\nsocial support as possible,\nand you're going to do just fine.\nAnd you go out and do that,\nand that's a recipe for total disaster\nbecause it's much, much\nmore subtle than that.\nIn one great example, okay,\nso you're getting shocks,\nyou want a warning beforehand,\nget a little warning light\n10 seconds before each shock,\nit's wonderfully protective.\nGet a warning light one\nsecond before the shock\ndoesn't do anything.\nThere's not enough time for you to get\nthe psychological benefits\nof the anticipation.\nNow instead, gets the\nlittle warning coming on\ntwo minutes before each shock,\nand it's going to make things worse\nbecause you're not going to\nbe sitting there like reveling\nand sort of your sense of predictability,\nand it's soon going to be, oh.\nYou're going to be sitting\nthere for two minutes saying,\ndamn, here it comes.\nPredictive information only\nworks in a narrow domain.\nSimilarly, control.\nDo you want to have a sense of\ncontrol on the face of stress?\nAnd the answer is, only if it\nis a mild to moderate stressor\nbecause what's happening then,\nyour sense of control is\ncompletely independent\nof the reality of whether\nyou have control or not,\nbut in the face of mild\nto moderate stressors,\na sense of control gets interpreted as,\nwow, look how much worse\nthings could have been.\nThank God, I have control,\nI'm on top of this to master my fate.\nIn contrast, if it's a major stressor,\nall that arbitrary sense of control does\nis make you think,\noh my God, look how much\nbetter it could have been.\nI could have prevented it.\nAnd we all know that intuitively\nlike we do that in the face\nof people's worst stressors.\nNobody could have stopped the car\nthe way the kids suddenly jumped out.\nIt wouldn't have mattered\nand if you had gotten them\nto the doctor a month ago,\ninstead of now, it\nwouldn't have made any...\nYou didn't actually have any control.\nAnd what you see is,\nyou absolutely want to have\na huge sense of control\nover mild to moderate stressors,\nand especially ones that\nresult in a good outcome.\nHooray, for me, and in the\nface of horrible stressors,\nwhat you want to do is\nlike self-deception,\nand like truth and beauty\ndon't necessarily go\nhand-in-hand at that point.\nAnd that's why stress management\ntechniques impact control\nand predictability wind up\nbeing far worse than neutral\nif you're preaching that\nto somebody homeless\nor somebody with terminal cancer,\nor somebody who is a refugee.\nTell a neurotic middle-class person\nthat they have the psychological tools\nto turn hell into heaven.\nAnd there's some truth to that.\nDo the same thing to somebody\nwho is going through a real hell,\nand that's just privileged heartlessness\nto do that because that doesn't work.\nMore and more outlets, if\nyour outlets are damaging,\nthat's not a good way to mitigate stress.\nSocial support, if you're\nconfusing mere acquaintances\nfor real social support,\nyou're going to have the rug pulled out\nfrom under you at some point.\nIf you're mistaking\nsocial support for being,\ngoing and bitching and moaning\nand demanding supportiveness\nfrom everyone around you\nrather than you doing\nsome of that reciprocally,\nthat's not going to work very well either.\nIt's not simple.\nIt's not for nothing that\nlots of us are really lousy.\nIt, like being good friends\nand things like that,\nand why it takes a lot\nof work to do it right?\nBecause you do it wrong\nand it may temporarily\nseem like a great thing,\nbut when it turns out to be\ncompletely misplaced faith,\nyou're going to be feeling\nworse than before you started.\n- Interesting.\nThese days, there's a lot of interest in\nusing physical practices\nto mitigate stress,\ntrying to get out of the ruminating,\nand to some extent take\ncontrol of neural circuits\nin the brain by using exercise\nand using breathing and hypnosis.\nAnd, of course, hypnosis has\na mental component as well.\nWhat are your thoughts\non stress mitigation\nfrom the standpoint of,\nokay, so we don't want\nto be rat number two,\nwe want to select something for ourselves,\nso we have to take the\ninitiative for ourselves.\nBeing forced into exercising is not,\nit could actually have\nnegative health effect perhaps.\nSo we need to pick something that we like,\nwe need to take control of it.\nIn terms of supporting other people,\nyou touched on that a bit.\nWhat is the best way to\nsupport other people?\nIs it to talk about the stressful thing?\nI mean, I'm not asking you\nto play psychologist here,\nbut I find divergent data on this.\nWe can spin ourselves up into a lather\nby ruminating on something.\nAnd language seems to me\nlike it's a wonderful tool,\nbut it's also a fairly deprived tool\nbecause it doesn't really get into\nthe core of our physiology\nlike something like breathing would.\nSo what are your thoughts on more,\nfor lack of a better way to\nput it, more head-centered,\ncognitive approaches to stress mitigation\nversus kind of going\nat the core physiology.\nCold showers now are even\na thing to some extent\njust to get people stress acclimated,\nvoluntarily taking cold showers.\n- That makes some sense physiologically,\npreconditioning for when\nthe real stressors come.\nIn terms of what you bring up,\noh, transcendental meditation,\nmindfulness, exercise,\nprayer, sort of reflecting on gratitude,\nall that sort of thing.\nCollectively they work on the average,\nthey work in terms of,\nthey can lower heart rate\nand cholesterol levels and have\nall sorts of good outcomes,\nbut they compromise us.\nOne is exactly the caveat\nthat comes out of the\nrunning wheel study is,\nit doesn't matter how\nmany of your friends swear\nby the stress management technique.\nIf doing it makes you want to scream\nyour head off after 10 seconds,\nthat's not the one that's\ngoing to work for you.\nSo read the fine print\nand the testimonials,\nbut it's got to be something\nthat works for you.\nAnother one is the stress\nmanagement type techniques\nthat work, you can't save\nthem for the weekend,\nyou can't save them for\nwhen you're stuck on\nhold on the phone with\nMuzak for two minutes.\nIt's got to be something where\nyou stop what you're doing\nand do it virtually,\ndaily or every other day,\nand spend 20, 30 minutes doing it.\nAnd what you see coming\nout of that is this\nlike 80/20 rule from economics.\n80/20, 80% of the complaints\nin the store come from\n20% of the customers, things like that.\nWhat you see is, if your\nentire life consists of\nevery single thing on your shoulders,\nthat you can't say no to 24/7.\nIf you've stopped that and finally said,\nmy wellbeing is important enough\nthat I'm finally get to\nsay no to some of the stuff\nthat I can't say no to.\nAnd I'm going to do it\nevery day for 20 minutes,\nwhatever stress management technique\nyou then do in those 20\nminutes sort of who knows what,\nyou're already 80% of the way there\nsimply by having decided your\nwellbeing is important enough\nthat you're going to stop every single day\nand have that as a priority.\nAnd that's exactly the same finding\nthat you find people with\nchronic depression untreated\nthat merely calling and\ngetting an appointment\nto see a mental health professional,\npeople start feeling better already\nbecause it's evidence that\nyou've been activated,\nand you matter enough to do this,\nand you could conceive\nthat this would actually\nhave a good outcome rather\nthan a hopeless one.\nJust doing something meditative\nor reflective every day or so,\nand it hardly even matters\nwhich one you're doing.\nAnd what comes out of that\nis thus another warning,\nwhich is do not trust anybody who says,\nit has been scientifically proven\nthat their brand of stress management\nworks better than the other ones.\nJust watch your wallet at that point.\n- Yeah, amen.\nI think one of the core goals of my lab\nand David Spiegel's lab,\nand I know you've worked with David\nand published papers with David as well\nis to really try and find out\nwhat are the various\nentry points to this thing\nthat we call the autonomic nervous system\nand the stress system,\nand these systems that when gone unchecked\nreally can take us down a dark path.\nAnd the idea that there\nare so many entry points\nis really the one that keeps,\nwhat the data keep telling\nus over and over again.\nSo there's no magic\nbreathing tool or exercise,\nit's any variety of those or one of those.\nAnd, again, we come back to this idea\nthat it's the one that you select\nand the one that you make space for,\nand it's the one that you hopefully enjoy\nthat's going to work best\nin terms of physiology.\n- And [mumbles] benign for those people\nwho were stuck around you.\n- Right, right, absolutely.\nAnd that brings me to this question of,\nI find it amazing that\nhow we perceive an event,\nand whether or not we chose\nto be in that event or not\ncan have such incredible different effects\non circuitry of the brain\nand circuitry of the body\nand biology of cells.\nAnd in some ways it boggles my mind,\nlike how can a decision made presumably\nwith the prefrontal cortex,\nalthough other parts of the brain as well,\nhow can that change\nessentially the polarity\nof a response in the body.\nAnd, I mean, you've talked before\nabout Type A personalities in there.\nWe don't have to go into\nall the detail there\nfor sake of time, but it is interesting\nthat the effects of endothelial cells.\nI mean, literally of the size of, [laughs]\nof the portals for blood\nare in opposite direction,\ndepending on whether or not somebody\nwants to be in a situation\nas a highly motivated person.\nMaybe you could just give\nus the top contour of that\nbecause I think it really illustrates\nthis principle so beautifully.\nAnd then maybe if you would,\nyou could just speculate on\nhow the brain might\nhave this switch to turn\none experience from terrible to beneficial\nor from beneficial to terrible,\nit's really fascinating.\n- Well, all you need to do is like tonight\nbefore you're going to sleep\nand you're lying in bed\nand you're nice and drowsy\nand your heart's beating nice and slow,\nyou start thinking about the fact that\nthat heart isn't going to beat forever.\n[Andrew laughs]\nAnd imagine your toes\ngetting cold afterward\nand imagine the flow of\nblood coming to a halt\nand all of you clotting.\nYou're going to be doing\nsomething with your physiology\nat that point that 99% of\nmammals out there only do\nif they're running frantically.\nAnd you're going to be turning on your\nsympathetic stress response with thought,\nwith emotions, with memory.\nAnd the measure of that is\njust how much the cortex\nand the limbic system\nsends projections down\nto all the autonomic\nregulators in the brain.\nYou can think autonomic\nregulatory neurons into action\nin ways that only other animals can do\nwith like extremes of\nenvironmental circumstances.\nAnd given that and the autonomic rule,\nI mean, the other big\nchallenge in understanding it\nis gigantic individual differences.\nAnd that's,\nwhen you talk about the\noptimal amount of stress,\nthe counts of stimulation,\nand in general that stress\nthat's not too severe\nand doesn't go on for too long\nand there is overall in\na benevolence setting.\nAnd under those conditions,\nwe'd love being stressed\nby something unexpected and\nout of control predictability\nlike a really interesting plot turn\nin the movie you're watching.\nThat's great, but you get\nthe individual differences\nthat somehow has to accommodate the fact\nthat for some people, the\nperfect stimulatory amount\nof stress is like getting up early\nfor an Audubon birdwatching\nwalk next Sunday morning.\nAnd for somebody else,\nit's signing up to be\nlike a mercenary in Yemen.\n[Andrew laughs]\nAnd tremendous individual differences\nthat swamp any simple prescriptions.\n- Yeah, the prefrontal cortex,\nthis thinking machinery\nthat we all harbor, it's\nsuch a double-edged sword.\nAnd what's remarkable to me is,\nhow the areas of the brain\nlike the hypothalamus\nand the amygdala, they're\nsort of like switches.\nI mean, there is context\nand there is gain control.\nYou talked about the gain\ncontrol by testosterone, etc.,\nbut they're really like switches.\nI mean, if you stimulate\nventromedial hypothalamus,\nyou get the right neurons,\nan animal will try and kill even an object\nthat's sitting next to it.\nYou tickle some other neurons,\nit'll try and mate with that same object.\nI mean, it's really wild.\nI think there are probably\nrules to prefrontal cortex also,\nbut it sounds like the context plural\nfrom which prefrontal cortex can draw from\nis probably infinite, so\nthat we could probably learn\nto perceive threat in anything.\nWhether or not it's another group\nor whether or not it's science\nor whether or not it's\nsomebody's version of\nthe shape of the earth versus another.\nI mean, it's like, you can\nplug in anything to this system\nand give it enough data,\nand I think it sounds like you\ncould drive a fear response\nor a love response.\nIs that overstepping?\n- Or [laughs] a mixed\nhorribly ambivalent one\nthat is changing by the millisecond,\nand then like could be\nmutually contradictory.\nNo, that's absolutely the case\nin the prefrontal cortex,\nI more than once have regretted\nhaving like wasted 30 years\nof my life studying the hippocampus\nthen I shoot him and studied\nthe prefrontal cortex\nbecause it's so much more\ninteresting what it does,\nand it's all this contextual stuff.\nIt's all the ways in which\nit's not okay to lie in this setting,\nbut it's a great thing in another.\nIt's not okay to kill\nunless you do it to them,\nand then you get a medal.\nIt's not, all of this social context\nand moral relativity and\nsituational ethic stuff,\nthat's the prefrontal cortex\nthat's got to master that.\nAnd that winds up meaning\nthat's the place in your brain\nmore than anywhere where you\nsay your perception of things\ncan powerfully influence the reality\nof what's coming into you.\n- Yeah.\n- I mean,\na great example, just\nharking back to testosterone.\nOkay, so exercise boosts\nup testosterone levels.\nDoes exercise and success do it more\nthan exercise and failure?\nA literature back in the 80s or so\nlooking at outcomes of marathons.\nDid testosterone rise more in the people\nwho win than the losers?\nWrestling matches.\nThings of that sort\nwith a simple prediction\nand the answer wound up being,\nyou didn't see a simple answer.\nOkay, you win the marathon,\nthat's not necessarily a predictor\nof increased testosterone.\nWhat's that about?\nAnd then you find like the\nwinner testosterone decreases,\nand you find out the guy who came in 73rd\nis having a massive testosterone increase.\nWhoa, what's that about?\nWhat's that about is\nfar more human subtlety.\nThe guy who won the race has\na decline in testosterone\nbecause he came in three minutes later\nthan he really, really was expecting.\nAnd everybody now is\ngoing to be writing it up\nabout how he's over the hill.\nAnd the guy who came in 73rd\nis having a boost of testosterone\nbecause he was assuming he'd\nbe dead from a heart attack\nby the third mile,\n[Andrew laughs]\nand instead he managed to finish.\nIt's this interpretive\nstuff going on in there,\nand that's what prefrontal\ncortex is about.\n- Amazing, it raises this\nquestion of cognitive flexibility,\nCan we tell ourselves that\nsomething is good for us\neven if we're not enjoying it?\nAnd can we wriggle around these corners of\nchoosing the exercise or doing the...\nPersonally I'm not a big fan\nof long bouts of meditation,\nbut I've benefited\ntremendously from things like\ndedicated breathing and\nshorter rounds of meditation.\nCan I tell myself that it's good for me\nand wriggle around the corner\nand get my physiology\nworking the way I want?\nDo we have cognitive flexibility?\nCan I be that third place\nrunner and tell myself,\nwell, at least I came in,\nI wanted to win so badly.\nThat was my primary goal,\nbut another goal was to\nbeat my previous time,\nand I did do that.\nAnd so, [laughs] I mean, it's...\nTo what extent can we\ntoggle this relationship\nbetween the prefrontal cortex\nand these other more primitive systems?\n- Well, an enormous amount.\nFor example, being low in a hierarchy\nis generally bad for health in\nlike every mammal out there,\nincluding us, but we do something special,\nwhich is we can be part\nof multiple hierarchies\nat the same time.\nAnd while you maybe low\nranking in one of them,\nyou could be extremely\nhigh ranking in another,\nyou're like have the crappiest\njob in your corporation,\nbut you are the captain\nof the softball team\nthis year for the company.\nAnd you better bet that's somebody\nwho is going to find all sorts of ways\nto decide that nine to\nfive Monday to Fridays,\njust stupid paying the bills.\nAnd what really matters is\nthe prestige on the weekend.\nYou're poorer, but you're the\ndeacon of your church here.\nAnd so we can play all sorts of\npsychological games with that.\nOne of the most like consistent,\nreliable ones that we do\nand need to use the frontal\ncortex like crazy is,\nsomebody does something rotten\nand you need to attribute it.\nAnd the answer is, they\ndid something wrong,\nhmm, because they're rotten.\nAlways have been\nor always will be this\nconstitutional explanation.\nYou do something rotten to somebody,\nand how do you explain it afterward?\nA situational one.\nI was tired, I was stressed\nin this sort of setting,\nI misunderstood this.\nWe're best at excusing\nourselves from bad things\nbecause we have access to our inner lives\nand we've got prefrontal cortexes\nthat are great at coming up\nwith a situational explanation\nrather than, hey, maybe you're just\nlike a selfish rotten\nhuman, you need to change.\nAnd that's all prefrontal cortex,\nand we do that every time,\nwe don't let somebody merge\nin the lane in front of us,\neven though you curse somebody\nwho does the same thing to you and...\nEndlessly.\n- I love it.\nYour statement about the\nfact that we can select\nmultiple hierarchies to participate in.\nTo me it seems like a particularly\nimportant one nowadays\nwith social media being so prevalent.\nI know you're not particularly\nactive on social media\nalthough you might be pleasantly,\nor I don't know unpleasantly\nsurprised to find out\nthat there's a lot of\npositive discussion about you\nand your work, so you don't\neven need to be on there.\nWe'll just continue to\ndiscuss [laughs] your work.\nBut what's interesting about\nsocial media I've found\nis that the context is very, very broad.\nI mean, one could argue that\nwho one selects to follow\nand which news articles\nyou're reading, etc.\ncan create a kind of a\nfunneling of information\nthat itself can be dangerous.\nMore verification of crazy ideas\nor even just less exposure to new ideas.\nBut there's also this idea\nthat social media is an\nincredibly broad context.\nSo as you scroll through\na feed, it's no longer\nlike being in your eighth grade classroom\nor your office or your faculty meeting.\nYou are being exposed to thousands,\nif not millions of contexts,\nthis meal, that soccer game,\nthis person's body,\nthis person's intellect.\nYouTube is another example.\nIt's a vast, vast landscape.\nSo the context is completely mishmash\nwhereas I'm assuming we evolved.\nI think we did evolve under contexts\nthat were much more constrained.\nWe interacted with a limited\nnumber of individuals\nand a limited number of different domains,\nseasons tended to be constrain us all.\nOf course, then we got\nphones and televisions,\nand this started to expand,\nbut now more than ever, our\nbrain, our prefrontal cortex\nand our sense of where we exist\nin these multiple hierarchies\nhas essentially wicked out into infinity.\nHow do you think this might be interacting\nwith some of these more primitive systems\nand other aspects of our biology?\n- Well, I think what you get is,\nin some ways the punchline of,\nwhat's most human about humans,\nwhich is over and over we\nuse the exact same blueprint,\nthe same hormones, the same\nkinases, the same receptors,\nthe same, everything were built\nout of the exact same stuff\nas all these other species out there,\nand then we go and use it\nin a completely novel way.\nAnd usually in terms of being able to\nabstract stuff over space\nand time in dramatic ways.\nSo, okay, you're a low ranking baboon\nand you can feel badly because\nyou just like killed a rabbit\nand you're about to eat\nand some higher ranking guy boots you off\nand takes it away from you,\nand you feel crummy and it's\nstressful and you're unhappy.\nWe are doing the exact same\nthings with like our brain\nand bodies when we're losing\na sense of self-esteem,\nbut we can do it by watching a\nmovie character on the screen\nand feeling inadequate\ncompared to like how wonderful\nor attractive they are.\nWe can do it by somebody driving past us\nin an expensive car, and we\ndon't even see their face,\nand you can feel belittled by\nyour own socioeconomic status.\nYou can watch like the\nLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\nor read about what Bezos is up to.\nAnd for some reason, decide\nyour life is less fulfilling\nbecause you didn't fly\ninto space for 11 minutes.\nAnd so you can feel miserable\nabout yourself in ways\nthat no other organism can,\nsimply because we can have\nour meaningful social networks\ninclude like the party you're\nreading about on Facebook\nthat you weren't invited to\nbecause it's taking place in Singapore,\nand you don't know any of those people,\nbut nonetheless, somehow\nthat could be a means for you\nto feel less content with\nwho you've turned out to be.\nDo you take steps in your own life\nto actively restrict the contexts\nin which you think and\nlive and contemplate\nin order to enhance your creative life,\nyour intellectual life?\nAre those steps that you actively take?\n- Well, I very actively\ndon't know how to make use\nof anything [laughs] with social media.\nSo I guess that counts as my having thus\nactively chosen not to learn how.\nSo that's the case certainly\nfor the last year and a half,\nlike lots of people, I've\ngone through stretches\nwhere I've managed to sort\nof enforce a moratorium\non looking at the news, and\nthat was wonderfully freeing.\nI think in the larger sense though,\nin addition to me being a neurobiologist,\nI'd sort of spent decades\nspending part of each year\nstudying wild baboons out in a\nnational park in East Africa.\nAnd I'd spend three months\na year without electricity,\nwithout phone calls,\nwith going 12 hours a day\nwithout saying a word to somebody.\nAnd when I finally would,\nit would be somebody\nnomadic pastoralist guy\nin a different language.\nYeah, I did 90% of my\nlike insightful thinking\nabout anything in the laboratory\nduring those three months each year,\nand not one in the lab, and\nnot when inundated with stuff.\n- Well, I think there is a shifting trend\ntowards trying to create a\nnarrowing of context that...\nAnd I like what I see, I have\na niece, she's 14-years-old\nand she and her friends are very good\nat putting their phones away.\nThey say, we're not\ngoing to have our phones\nfor this interaction, especially after...\nAnd I realized we're\nstill somewhat in this.\nIt's unclear where it's headed,\nbut 2020 was so restrictive\nand she was so separated from her friends.\nNow it's, let's really\nfocus on being together\nand not bring in all these\nother elements from our phones.\nAnd that brings me great hope for\nthat generation, [laughs]\nmaybe they will...\nOr who knows, maybe they'll\nrun off and study baboons,\nwe need more field researchers.\nSo along the lines of choice,\nI'd like to shift gears slightly\nand talk about freewill,\nabout our ability to make choices at all.\n- Well, my personal way out in left field\ninflammatory stance is,\nI don't think we have a shred of freewill\ndespite 95% of philosophers.\nAnd I think probably the\nmajority of neuroscientists\nare saying that we have freewill\nin at least some circumstances.\nI don't think there's any at all.\nAnd the reason for this is,\nyou do something,\nyou behave, you make a choice, whatever.\nAnd to understand why you did that,\nwhere did that intention come from?\nPart of it was due to like\nthe sensory environment\nyou were in the previous minute.\nSome of it is from the hormone levels\nin your bloodstream that morning.\nSome of it is from whether\nyou had a wonderful\nor stressful last three months\nand what sort of neuroplasticity happened.\nPart of it is what hormone levels\nyou were exposed to as a fetus.\nPart of it is what culture\nyour ancestors came up with,\nand thus how you were\nparented when you were a kid.\nAll of those are in there,\nand you can understand where\nbehavior is coming from\nwithout incorporating all of those.\nAnd at that point,\nnot only are there all of\nthese relevant factors,\nbut they're ultimately all one factor.\nIf you're talking about what evolution\nhas to do with your behavior,\nby definition you're also\ntalking about genetics.\nIf you're talking about what your genes\nhave to do with behavior, by\ndefinition you're talking about\nhow your brain was constructed\nor what proteins are coded for.\nIf you're talking about\nlike your mood disorder now,\nyou're talking about the sense of efficacy\nyou were getting as a five-year-old.\nThey're all intertwined.\nAnd when you look at all those influences,\nbasically like the challenge is,\nshow me a neuron that\njust caused that behavior,\nor show me a network of neurons\nthat just caused that behavior.\nAnd show me that nothing\nabout what they just did\nwas influenced by anything\nfrom the sensory environment\none second ago to the\nevolution of your species.\nAnd there's no space in there\nto fit in a freewill concept\nthat winds up being in your\nbrain, but not of your brain.\nThere's simply no wiggle\nroom for it there.\n- So I can appreciate that our behaviors\nand our choices are the\nconsequences of a long line\nof dominoes that fell\nprior to that behavior.\nBut is it possible that I can intervene in\nthe domino effect, so to speak.\nIn other words, can my\nrecognition of the fact\nthat genes have heritability,\nthere is an epigenome that,\nthere is a hormonal context,\nthere is a historical context.\nCan the knowledge of that give me some\nsmall shard of freewill?\nMeaning, does it allow me to say, ah,\nokay, I accept that my choices\nare somewhat predetermined,\nand yet knowing that gives me\nsome additional layer of control?\nIs there any philosophical\nor biological universe\nin which that works?\n- Nah.\nAll of that can produce the\nwonderfully positive belief\nthat change can happen.\nEven a traumatic change, even\nin the worst of circumstances,\nmost unlikely people,\nand change can happen,\nthings can change.\nDon't be fatalistic, don't decide\nbecause we're a mechanistic,\nbiological machines\nthat nothing can ever...\nChange can happen,\nbut where people go off the rails\nis translating that into,\nwe can change ourselves.\nWe don't, we can't because\nthere's no freewill.\nHowever, we can be\nchanged by circumstance.\nAnd the point of it is,\nlike you look at an Aplysia, a sea slug\nthat has learned to retract its gill\nin response to a shock on its tail,\nyou can do like conditioning,\nPavlovian conditioning on it,\nand it has learned, its\nbehavior has been changed\nby its environment.\nAnd you hear news about something like\nhorrifically depressing going on,\nand refugees in wherever.\nAnd as a result, you feel\na little bit more helpless\nand a less of a sense of\nefficacy in the world,\nand both of your behaviors\nhave been changed.\nOkay, okay, yeah, I guess that,\nbut the remarkable thing is,\nit's the exact same neurobiology.\nThe signal transduction\npathways that were happening\nin that sea snail incorporate\nthe exact same kinases\nand proteases and phosphatases\nthat we do when you're having\nmammalian fear conditioning,\nor when you're alert, it's conserved.\nIt's the exact same thing,\nit's simply playing out\nin obviously a much, much fancier domain.\nAnd because you have learned\nthat change is possible\ndespite understanding mechanistically\nthat we can't change\nourselves volitionally,\nbut because you understand\nchange is possible,\nyou have just changed\nthe ability of your brain\nto respond to optimistic stimuli.\nAnd you have changed the\nability of your brain\nto now send you in the\ndirection of being exposed to\nmore information that will seem cheerful\nrather than depressing.\nOh my God, that's amazing,\nwhat Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther king\nand all these folks did.\nWow, under the most\nadverse of circumstances,\nthey were able to do.\nMaybe I can also, maybe I can go read more\nabout people like them to\nget even more data points\nof change the neurochemistry,\nso that your responses are different now.\nAnd you're tilted a little\nbit more in that direction\nof feeling like you can make a difference\ninstead of it's all damn hopeless.\nSo enormous change can happen,\nbut the last thing that\ncould come out of a view of,\nwe are nothing more or less\nthan the sum of our biology\nand its interactions with environment,\nis to throw up your hands and say,\nand thus it's no use\ntrying to change anything.\n- So we can acknowledge that\nchange is extremely hard\nto impossible, that\ncircumstances can change,\nand yet that striving to\nbe better human beings\nis still a worthwhile endeavor.\nDo I have that correct?\n- Absolutely.\nBecause simply the knowledge,\neither from experience\nor making it to the end of\nthe right neurobiology class\nhas taught you that change can happen\nwithin a framework of a\nmechanistic neurobiology.\nYou were now more open\nto being made optimistic\nby the good news in the world around you.\nYou are more likely to be\ninspired by this or that,\nyou were more resistant to\ngetting discouraged by bad news,\nsimply because you now\nunderstand it's possible.\n- Mm-hmm, yeah, somebody who spent\nmuch of his career working\non the hippocampus,\nI have to assume that you are\na believer in neuroplasticity,\nthat neural circuits can change\nin response to experience,\nand that some of the same\nso-called top-down mechanisms\nof prefrontal cortex that\nwe were talking about before\ncan play a role there,\nthat the decision to try and change\nand the pursuit of knowledge\nand the pursuit of experience\ncan shape our circuitry,\nand therefore make us different\nmachines, so to speak.\n- Yeah.\nAnd not only can say\nprenatal hormone exposure\nchanged the way your brain\nis being constructed,\nbut learning that\nprenatal hormone exposure\ncan change the construction of your brain\nwill change your brain right now,\nand how you think about where\nyour intentions came from.\nWow, maybe that had\nsomething to do with it.\nThe knowledge of the\nknowledge is an effector\nin and of itself.\n- That's such an important and\npowerful statement to hear.\nI think that many people\nthink that if a tool,\nif it doesn't involve\na pill or a protocol,\nthat it's useless.\nAnd certainly there\nare pills and protocols\nthat are very useful\nin a variety of context\nfor a variety of things, but\nthe idea that knowledge itself,\nwhereas you put it, knowledge\nof knowledge is itself a tool,\nI think is a very important\nconcept for people\nto embed in their minds.\nAnd, listen, I'm so\ngrateful for this discussion\nand for you raising these topics.\nI think that people,\nmany people know your work\non testosterone, on stress,\nand we've covered some of that today,\nthe work on freewill and this\nidea that we are hopeless\nor that we are in total control.\nI think I'm realizing in listening to you\nthat it's neither is true,\nand that the solution resides\nin understanding more about freewill\nand lack of it, [laughs]\nand also neuroplasticity.\nYou're working on a book about freewill,\nare you willing to tell us\na little bit about that book\nand where you are in that process\nand what we can look forward to?\n- Yeah, it's going really slow.\nTitle is, \"Determined: A Science\nof Life Without Freewill.\"\nAnd essentially the\nfirst half of the book is\ntrying to convince a reader,\nokay, if not that there's\nno freewill whatsoever,\nbut at least there's a lot\nless than is normally assumed.\nAnd I'm going through all the\nstandard arguments for freewill,\nand why that doesn't make sense\nwith 21st century science?\nAnd that has led to reading\na lot of very frustrating\nphilosophers who basically\nare willing to admit\nthat stuff is made out of\nlike atoms and molecules.\nAnd like there's a physical\nreality sort of world,\nthey're not just relying on magic,\nbut that they believe in\nfreewill for magical reasons,\nand where it doesn't make sense.\nOkay, so the first half of the book is to\nhopefully convince people that\nthere's much less freewill\nthan we used to think.\nAnd then the second half\nis this gigantic juncture\nbuilt around the fact\nthat I haven't thought\nthere's any freewill since\nI was like an adolescent.\nAnd despite thinking that way,\nI still have absolutely no idea\nhow you're supposed to\nfunction with that belief.\nHow are you supposed to\ngo about everyday life\nif anything you feel\nentitled to isn't true?\nIf any angers and hatreds\nyou feel aren't justified,\nif there's no such thing as appropriate,\nblame or punishment or praise or reward,\nand none of it makes any sense,\nand somebody like even\ncompliments you on your haircut,\nand you've been conditioned\nto say, oh, thanks,\nas if you had something to do.\nHow are we supposed to function with that?\nAnd so the second half\nis wrestling with that,\nand what the punchline there is,\nis it's going to be incredibly hard.\nAnd if you think it's going to be hard\nto subtract a notion of freewill\nout of making sense of\nlike serial murderers,\nit's going to be a thousand times harder\nmaking sense of when somebody\nsays \"good job\" to you.\n[Andrew laughs]\nAnd because it's the exact\nsame on reality of sort\nof our interpretations.\nIt's going to be incredibly hard,\nbut nonetheless when\nyou look at the history\nof how we have subtracted\nthe notion of agency\nout of all sorts of realms of\nblame, starting with thinking\nthat witches caused\nhailstorms 500 years ago\nto the notion that\npsychodynamically screwed up mothers\ncause schizophrenia, we've done it.\nWe've done it endless number of times,\nwe've been able to subtract\nout a sense of volition\nin understanding how the\nworld works around us.\nAnd we don't have murderers\nrunning amuck on the street,\nand society hasn't\ncollapsed into a puddle,\nand in fact, it's a more humane society.\nSo the good news is it's possible\nbecause we've done it\nrepeatedly in the past,\nbut it's going to be hard as hell.\nAnd it's hard as hell to try\nto write about that coherently,\n[laughs] I'm discovering,\nso it's going slowly.\n- Well, I speak for many,\nmany people when I say\nthat we're really excited\nfor the book when it's done\nand we will patiently wait,\nbut with great excitement\nfor the book, \"Determined\".\nYou said it's the title, correct?\n- Yeah, \"Determined: The Science\nof Life Without Freewill\".\nIt seems like you can't\npublish your book these days\nwithout a sub-title, so that's it?\n- Fantastic.\nWell, very excited to read the book.\nI'm very grateful to you\nfor this conversation today,\nI learned a ton.\nEvery time you speak I learn,\nand for me it's really been a pleasure\nand a delight to interact with you today\nand over the previous years,\nI should say, as colleagues.\nAnd thank you again, Robert,\nfor everything that you do\nand all the hard, hard work and thinking\nthat you put into your work\nbecause it's clear that\nyou put a lot of hard work\nand
