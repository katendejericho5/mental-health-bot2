    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday I have the pleasure of\nintroducing Dr. Anna Lembke.\nDr. Lembke is a psychiatrist\nand the chief of\nthe Addiction Medicine\nDual Diagnosis Clinic\nat Stanford University School of Medicine.\nShe's a psychiatrist who treats patients\nstruggling with addiction.\nShe has successfully treated\npatients dealing with\ndrug addiction, alcohol addiction,\nand behavioral addictions,\nsuch as gambling and sex addiction,\nas well as other types of addiction.\nIn fact, during our discussion,\nI learned that there are\na huge range of behaviors\nand substances to which\npeople can become addicted to,\nand that there is a common\nbiological underpinning\nof all those addictions.\nI also learned that there is a common path\nto the treatment and recovery\nfrom essentially all addictions.\nDr. Lembke explained that to me\nand explained how to think\nabout and conceptualize\nour own addictions,\nas well as the addictions of other people\nwho are struggling to get\ntreatment, move through treatment,\nand stay sober from their addictions.\nIn addition to treating patients,\nDr. Lembke is an author\nand was featured in\nthe 2020 Netflix documentary,\n\"The Social Dilemma\".\nI'm excited to tell you that\nshe has a new book coming out\ncalled \"Dopamine Nation,\nFinding Balance in the Age of Indulgence\".\nThe book comes out August 24th\nand is an absolutely\nfascinating read into addiction\nand ways to treat various\ntypes of addiction.\nI've read the book cover to cover,\nand all I'll tell you is that\nat the very first chapter\nand throughout, you are going\nto be absolutely blown away.\nThe stories about her patients\nare extremely engaging.\nIt brings forward the\nreal struggle of addiction\nand the incredible, I think\nit's fair to say heroic battles,\nthat people fight in order\nto get through addictions\nof various kinds.\nAnd all of that is woven through\nwith story, with science,\nin ways that make it very\naccessible to anyone,\nwhether or not you have a\nscience background or not.\nI can't recommend it highly enough.\nSo again, the book is\n\"Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance\nin the Age of Indulgence\",\nit comes out August\n24th of this year, 2021.\nAnd you can pre-order that\nbook by going to Amazon.\nWe will provide a link to\nthat in the show caption.\nBefore we begin,\nI just want to mention that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA make sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolute utmost quality.\nFounded by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\neverything about the\nsunglasses and eye glasses\nthat ROKA makes was designed\nwith performance in mind.\nFirst of all, they're very lightweight.\nYou don't even really notice\nthat they're on your face.\nSecond of all, even if you get\nsweaty, they don't slip off.\nIn fact, they were\ndesigned to be worn at work\nor around the house, but also\nif you're running or biking.\nSo you can move seamlessly\nbetween different activities\nwithout having to change your\nsunglasses or eyeglasses.\nIn addition, the lenses are designed\nwith the science of the\nvisual system in mind.\nI've spent my career working on\nthe science of the visual system,\nand I can tell you that it's\nnot trivial to build a lens\nthat allows you to see\nwith perfect clarity,\nwhether or not you're in bright sunshine\nand then move into shadows.\nBut the ROKA glasses allow you to do that.\nYou always see things\nwith absolute clarity.\nAnother terrific thing about\nROKA eyeglasses and sunglasses\nis the aesthetic.\nA lot of so-called performance\nsunglasses and eyeglasses,\nthey're not really built\nwith the best aesthetic\nand they kind of make\npeople look like cyborgs.\nWith ROKA, they have a\nlot of different styles\nto choose from, but all\nthose styles are the sort\nthat you could wear out\nto dinner or to work,\nor when engaging in physical activity.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA\nglasses you can go to ROKA,\nthat's R-O-K-A dot com,\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nget 20% off your first order.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done.\nAnd I've been doing that\nfor a number of years,\nfor the simple reason that\nmost, if not all of the factors,\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health,\ncan only be analyzed in detail\nwith a quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nyou can get further insight\ninto what's going on beneath\nthe hood, so to speak.\nThe problem with a lot of\nblood and DNA tests, however,\nis you get numbers back,\nyou get the levels back of various things\nand you find out if certain\nthings are too high or too low\nor right on target,\nbut there are no directives\nabout how to move those numbers\nin the direction that you\nwould want them to go.\nWith InsideTracker, they have a dashboard\nthat makes all of that very easy,\nand that dashboard takes your numbers\nand can help direct you towards\nparticular lifestyle factors,\nnutrition factors, exercise,\nsupplementation, et cetera,\nthat can help you bring\nthose numbers into the ranges\nthat are right for you.\nIf you'd like to try\nInsideTracker you can go to\ninsidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation\napp that's backed by\n25 published peer review studies\nand has over 600,000 5-star reviews.\nI've been meditating for a very long time.\nI'm 45-years-old now, almost 46,\nand I started meditating when\nI was about 15-years-old.\nThe problem, however, is keeping\nup a meditation practice.\nI've experienced this myself.\nI've had periods of time\nwhere I'm meditating regularly\nand then periods of time\nwhere I just kind of\nfall off the rails and I'm\njust not doing it at all.\nThere's now tons of evidence,\nevidence from neuroscience,\nevidence from psychology,\nevidence from areas of\nbiology focused on stress\nand the immune system,\nthat a meditation practice,\nwhen done regularly,\nis extremely beneficial for\nmental and physical health,\nand things like focus and creativity.\nHowever, you have to do\nthe meditation practice,\nand so if you're not doing it regularly,\nthat's a serious problem.\nAnd if you are doing it regularly, great.\nWith Headspace, I find that I can\nstick to a meditation\npractice very easily.\nIn fact, that's why I started using it\nand that's why I continue to use it.\nI try and get a meditation\npractice in every day,\nbut sometimes that requires that it be\na brief meditation practice.\nWith Headspace, they have a huge range\nof different meditations\nof different durations,\nand so that's really helpful\nin building and maintaining\nthese powerful meditation practices.\nIf you want to try Headspace\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a free one month trial\nwith Headspace's full\nlibrary of meditations.\nThis is the best deal\noffered by Headspace.\nBasically you get access\nto everything they've got,\ncompletely free, for a one month trial.\nSo if you'd like to try that,\ngo to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd now for my discussion\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke.\nAll right, great to have you here.\n- Thank you for having me,\nI'm excited to be here.\n- Yeah, I have a lot of questions for you.\nI, and many listeners of this podcast,\nare obsessed with dopamine,\nand what is dopamine,\nhow does it work?\nWe all hear that dopamine is this molecule\nassociated with pleasure.\nI think the term dopamine hits,\nlike I'm getting a dopamine\nhit from this, from Instagram,\nor from likes or from\npraise or from whatever,\nis now commonly heard.\nWhat is dopamine,\nand what are maybe some\nthings about dopamine\nthat most people don't know?\nAnd probably that I don't know either.\n- So dopamine is a neurotransmitter,\nand neurotransmitters are those molecules\nthat bridge the gap between two neurons.\nSo they essentially allow one neuron,\nthe pre-synaptic neuron,\nto communicate with the\npost-synaptic neuron.\nDopamine is intimately associated\nwith the experience of reward,\nbut also with movement,\nwhich I think is really interesting,\nbecause movement and\nreward are linked, right?\nIf you think about,\nyou know, early humans,\nyou had to move in order\nto go seek out the water\nor the meat or whatever it was.\nAnd even in the most primitive organisms,\ndopamine is released when food\nis sensed in the environment.\nFor example, C elegans,\na very primitive worm.\nSo dopamine is this really powerful,\nimportant molecule in the brain\nthat helps us experience pleasure.\nIt's not the only neurotransmitter\ninvolved in pleasure,\nbut it's a really, really important one.\nAnd if you want to think about something\nthat most people don't\nknow about dopamine,\nwhich I think is really interesting,\nis that we are always releasing dopamine\nat a kind of tonic baseline rate.\nAnd it's really the\ndeviation from that baseline,\nrather than like hits\nof dopamine in a vacuum,\nthat make a difference.\nSo when we experience pleasure,\nour dopamine release goes above baseline,\nand likewise dopamine can go\nbelow that tonic baseline,\nand then we experience a kind of pain.\n- Interesting.\nSo is it fair to say that one's\nbaseline levels of dopamine,\nhow frequently we are releasing dopamine,\nin the absence of some, I don't know,\ndrug or food or experience,\njust sitting, being,\nis that associated with\nhow happy somebody is,\ntheir kind of baseline of\nhappiness or level of depression?\n- There is evidence that shows\nthat people who are depressed\nmay indeed have lower\ntonic levels of dopamine.\nSo that's a really reasonable thought,\nand there is some evidence to\nsuggest that that may be true.\nThe other thing that we know,\nand this is really kind\nof what the book is about,\nis that if we expose ourselves chronically\nto substances or behaviors\nthat repeatedly release\nlarge amounts of dopamine\nin our brains reward pathway,\nthat we can change our tonic baseline\nand actually lower it over time,\nas our brain tries to compensate\nfor all of that dopamine,\nwhich is more really than we\nwere designed to experience.\n- Interesting and is,\nis it the case that our\nbaseline levels of dopamine\nare set by our genetics, by our heredity?\n- Well I think, you know,\nif you think about sort of,\nyou know, the early stages\nof development and infancy,\ncertainly that is true.\nYou're kind of, you know,\nborn with probably whatever is\nyour baseline level.\nBut obviously your experiences\ncan have a huge impact\non where your dopamine level\nultimately settles out.\n- So if somebody's disposition is one of\nconstant excitement and\nanticipation, or easily excited,\nI think about the kind of\npeople where you say hey,\ndo you want to check out\nthis new place for tacos,\nand they're like \"Yeah, that'd be great!\"\nAnd other people are a little\nmore cynical, harder to budge.\nLike my bulldog Costello.\nVery, very stable, low levels of dopamine\nwith big inflections in his case.\nDo you think that's set\nin terms of our parents,\nand obviously nature and\nnurture interact, but is that,\nis dopamine at the core\nof our temperament?\n- I don't really think we\nknow the answer to that,\nbut I will say that people\nare definitely born with\ndifferent temperaments, and\nthose temperaments do affect\ntheir ability to experience joy.\nAnd, you know, we've known\nthat for a long time,\nand we describe that\nin many different ways.\nOne of the ways that we\ndescribe that in the modern era\nis to use psychiatric nomenclature.\nLike this person has a dysthymic\ntemperament, or, you know,\nthis person has chronic\nmajor depressive disorder.\nIn terms of looking specifically\nat who's vulnerable to addiction,\nthat's an interesting sort of mixed bag\nbecause when you look at the research\non risk factors for addiction,\nso what kind of temperament of a person\nmakes them more vulnerable to addiction,\nyou see some interesting findings.\nFirst you see that people\nwho are more impulsive\nare more vulnerable to addiction.\nSo what is impulsivity?\nThat means having difficulty\nputting space between\nthe thought or desire to do something,\nand actually doing it.\nAnd people who have difficulty\nputting a space there,\nwho have a thought to do something\nand just do it impulsively,\nare people who are more\nvulnerable to addiction.\n- Interesting.\nCould I, in terms of impulsivity,\nis this something that relates literally\nto the startle reflex?\nLike I, for instance, as a lab director,\nI'm familiar with walking\naround my lab and when I decide,\ndeciding I'm going to talk to my people,\nof course when they knock on\nmy door it's always like wait,\nwhy am I being bothered right now?\nEven though I love to talk to them.\nBut I walk around my\nlab from time to time,\nand some people I notice, I'll\nsay, do you have a moment,\nand they'll slowly turn\naround and say, yeah,\nor no, in some cases.\nAnd other people will jump\nthe moment I say their name.\nThey actually have a, a kind\nof a heightened startle reflex.\nIs that related to impulsivity,\nor is what you're referring to\nan attempt to withhold behavior\nthat's very deliberate,\nunder very deliberate conditions?\n- Yeah, so I don't think\nthat that startle reflex\nis necessarily related to impulsivity.\nThat can be related to anxiety.\nSo people who are high anxiety people\nwill tend to have more\nof a startle reflex.\nImpulsivity is a little bit different.\nAnd by the way, impulsivity\nis not always bad, right.\nImpulsivity is that thing\nwhere there's not a lot of self-editing\nor worrying about future consequences.\nYou know, you have the idea\nto do something and you do it.\nAnd of course we can\nimagine many scenarios\nwhere that's absolutely wonderful.\nYou know, there can be a sort of,\nlet's say intimate\ninteractions between people,\nwhere you wouldn't really want to be\nsuper inhibited about it, right.\nYou would want to be\ndisinhibited and impulsive.\nI can also like imagine like\nsort of fight or flight scenarios,\nlike battle scenarios, right,\nwhere it would really\nbe good to be impulsive\nand just go rhino!\n- Where hesitation can cost you your life?\n- Right, yes, that's right, that's right.\nBut, you know,\nand I think this brings up a really,\nsomething that I've come to believe\nafter 25 years of practicing psychiatry,\nis that what we now conceptualize\nin our current ecosystem\nas mental illness,\nare actually traits that\nin another ecosystem\nmight be very advantageous.\nThey're just not advantageous right now,\nbecause of the world that we live in.\nAnd I think, you know,\nimpulsivity is potentially\none of those, right?\n'Cause we live in this\nworld that's sort of like,\nyou have to constantly be\nthinking sort of rationally about\nthe consequences of X, Y, or Z.\nAnd it's such a sensory\nrich environment, right,\nthat we're being bombarded with\nall of these opportunities,\nthese sensory opportunities.\nAnd we have to constantly check ourselves.\nAnd so impulsivity is\nsomething that right now\ncan be a difficult trait,\nbut isn't in and of itself a bad thing.\n- I see.\nAnd it's, I'm beginning to\nrealize it's a fine line\nbetween spontaneity and impulsivity.\n- Yeah.\n- What is pleasure and how does it work,\nat the biological level,\nand if it feels right,\nat the psychological level?\nAnd if you don't mind\npainting a picture of sort of\nthe range of things that you\nhave observed in your clinic,\nor in life, that people\ncan become addicted to.\nBut just to start off really simply,\nwhat is this thing that we call pleasure?\n- Well, I think it's actually\nreally hard to define pleasure\nin any kind of succinct way,\nbecause certainly there is\nthe seeking out of a high,\nor a euphoria, or I think, you know,\nthe kind of experience that\nalmost anybody would associate\nwith the word pleasure.\nBut also the seeking out\nof those same substances and behaviors\nis often a way to escape pain.\nSo for example, when I talk\nto people with addiction,\nsometimes their initial\nforay into using a drug\nis to get pleasure,\nbut very often it's a way\nto escape their suffering,\nwhatever their suffering may be.\nAnd certainly as people become addicted,\neven those who initially\nwere seeking out pleasure\nare ultimately just\ntrying to avoid the pain\nof withdrawal or the\npain of the consequences\nof their drug use.\nSo I think it's, you know, very\nhard to actually, you know,\ndefine it as this unitary thing.\nAnd it's certainly not\njust getting a high.\nThere are so many ways in which people\nsort of want to escape,\nwhich is not the same thing\nas sort of this hedonic,\nyou know, wanting to feel pleasure.\n- So someone could decide that\nthey want to go out and dance,\nor get up and dance, because\nof the pleasure of dancing.\nI can imagine that.\nBut, and maybe it's very\ndifficult for them to stay seated\nwhen a particular song\ncomes on, for instance.\nBut seeking what we would call pleasure\nin order to eliminate pain,\nthat evokes a different\npicture in my mind.\nThat evokes a picture of\nsomebody that feels lost\nor depressed or underwhelmed.\nI definitely want to get into the precise\nand general description of\naddiction and what that is,\nbut in a previous conversation we had,\nyou said something that\nreally rung in my mind,\nwhich is that many people who\nbecome addicted to things,\nlet's call them addicts,\nhave this feeling that normal\nlife isn't interesting enough.\nThat they are seeking a\nsuper normal experience,\nand that the day-to-day routine balance,\nwhich is actually in\nthe title of your book,\n\"Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance\nin the Age of Indulgence\",\nthat the word balance itself\ncan sometimes be a bit of\nan adversive term for people.\nAnd I'm struck by this idea,\nand the reason I want to explore it is\nbecause so much of what I see online\nis about generating a lack of balance,\nabout being tilted forward at all times,\nreally leaning into life\nhard, experiencing life,\nyou know, living a full life.\nEven the commencement\nspeech given by Steve Jobs\non this campus was really\nabout finding passion, digging.\nYou know, that's so much\nin the narrative now.\nSo maybe you could just\ntell us a little bit\nabout your experience\nwith this association,\nif it really exists, between\npeople's sense of the normalcy,\nor maybe even how boring life can be,\nand their tendency to\nbecome addicts of some sort.\n- Yeah, well, I mean,\nI think that life for\nhumans has always been hard,\nbut I think that now it's\nharder in unprecedented ways.\nAnd I think that the way\nthat life is really hard now\nis that it actually is really boring.\nAnd the reason that it's boring is\nbecause all of our survival\nneeds are met, right?\nI mean, we don't even\nhave to leave our homes\nto meet every single physical need,\nyou know, as long as\nyou're of a certain level\nof financial wellbeing,\nwhich frankly, you know,\nwe talk so much about,\nyou know, the income gap,\nand certainly there is this enormous gap\nbetween rich and poor.\nBut that gap is smaller\nthan it's ever been\nin like the history of humans.\nEven the poorest of the\npoor have more excess income\nto spend on leisure goods,\nthan they ever have\nbefore in human history.\nIf you look at leisure time, for example,\nso people without a high school education\nhave 42% more leisure time\nthan people with a college degree.\nSo my point here is that life is hard now\nin this really weird way,\nin that we don't really have\nanything that we have to do.\nSo we're all forced to\nmake stuff up, you know,\nwhether it's being a\nscientist or being a doctor,\nor being an Olympic athlete, or, you know,\nclimbing Mount Everest.\nAnd people really vary in\ntheir need for friction.\nAnd some people need a\nlot more than others.\nAnd if they don't have it,\nthey're really, really unhappy.\nAnd I do think that a lot\nof the people that I see\nwith addiction and other\nforms of mental illness\nare people who need more friction.\nLike they're unhappy,\nnot necessarily because\nthere's something wrong\nwith their brain,\nbut because their brain is\nnot suited to this world.\n- And do you think they have that sense,\nmy brain isn't suited to this world,\nor they simply feel a restlessness\nand they're constantly\nseeking stimulation?\n- I think that's right, yeah.\nI think it's not really\nknowing what's wrong with me,\nand why am I unhappy,\nhow can I be happier?\nAnd of course, as you talk about,\nwhat's so pervasive in our narrative now\nis like find your passion,\nyou know, find your, you know,\nout of whatever it is, to save the world.\nAnd in a way that's good\nbecause it has people out\nin the world and seeking.\nBut in a way it can also be\nmisleading in the sense that\nI think people aren't entirely aware\nthat the world is a hard\nplace, and that life is hard,\nand that, you know, like we're\nall kind of making it up.\nDo you know what I mean?\n- Yeah.\nWell there's a book by Cal Newport,\nI don't know if you\nknow Cal Newport's work,\nbut you guys are very\nsymbiotic in your messages.\nHe's a professor of computer\nscience at Georgetown.\nYes, at Georgetown.\nAnd wrote a book some years\nago, really ahead of its time,\ncalled \"So Good They Can't Ignore You\",\nwhich is about not\nmeditating or doing much work\nto try and figure out what\none's passion is by thinking,\nbut rather go out and acquire skills,\n- Right.\n- and develop a sense\nof passion for something\nby your experience of hard work\nand getting better end feedback.\n- Right.\n- A little bit of\nthe growth mindset,\nthink of our colleague Carol Dweck.\nBut he's gone on to\nwrite books, \"Deep Work\",\nwhich is all about removing\nyourself from technology\nand doing deep work.\n- Yes, right.\n- And he's been a big proponent of\nthe evils of context switching\ntoo often throughout the day.\n- [Anna] Yeah.\n- For sake of productivity, mostly.\nHis new book is called\n\"A World Without Email.\"\nI'm beginning to realize,\nas I cite off these books\nand your book, \"Dopamine Nation,\nFinding Balance in the Age of Indulgence\",\nthat maybe the reason why\nyou two don't know about one another\nis because neither of\nyou are on social media.\n- That's it.\n- Right.\n- That's it.\n- And yet you're two of\nthe most productive people\nthat I know, including productive authors.\nSo that's a discussion unto itself.\nBut I find this fascinating.\nSo let's talk about the pleasure\npain balance and addiction.\nAnd I've heard you use this seesaw\nor balance scale,\n- Right.\n- analogy before.\nAnd I think it's a wonderful\none that really, for me,\nclarified what addiction is,\nat least at the mechanistic level.\n- Yeah, so to me, one of the\nmost significant findings\nin neuroscience in the last 75 years\nis that pleasure and pain are co-located,\nwhich means the same parts of the brain\nthat process pleasure also process pain.\nAnd they work like a balance.\nSo when we feel pleasure,\nour balance tips one way,\nwhen we feel pain, it tips\nin the opposite direction.\nAnd one of the overriding\nrules governing this balance\nis that it wants to stay level.\nSo it doesn't want to\nremain tipped very long\nto pleasure or to pain.\nAnd with any deviation from neutrality,\nthe brain will work very hard\nto restore a level balance,\nor what scientists call homeostasis.\nAnd the way the brain does that is\nwith any stimulus to one side,\nthere will be a tip in equal\nand opposite amount to the other side.\n- It's like the principle laws of physics.\n- Yes, right, right.\nSo like, I like to watch YouTube videos.\nWhen I watch YouTube videos\nof \"American Idol\", you know,\nit tips to the side of pleasure.\nAnd then when I stop watching\nit, I have a comedown, right,\nwhich is a tip to the\nequal and opposite amount\non the other side.\nAnd that's that moment of wanting to watch\none more YouTube video, right.\n- Yeah, and I just want\nto interject there.\nSo this moment of\nwanting to watch another,\nthat is associated with pain, I think,\nis, are we always aware of that happening?\nBecause you just described\nit in a very conscious way.\n- Right.\n- But when I indulge in something I enjoy,\nI'm usually thinking about just wanting\n- Yes, yes.\n- more of that thing.\nI don't think about the pain,\n- Yes.\n- I just think about more.\n- Right.\nSo really excellent point\nbecause we're mostly not aware of it.\nAnd it's also reflexive.\nSo it's not something\nthat consciously happens,\nor that we're aware of,\nunless we really begin to pay attention.\nAnd when we begin to pay attention,\nwe really can become very\naware of it in the moment.\nAgain, it's like a falling away.\nYou're on social media and, you know,\nyou get a good tweet of something,\nand then you can't stop yourself\nbecause there's this\nawareness, a latent awareness,\nthat as soon as I disengage\nfrom this behavior,\nI'm going to experience\na kind of a pain, right.\nA falling away, a missing that feeling,\na wanting more of it.\nAnd of course, one way to combat that\nis to do it more, right, and\nmore, and more, and more.\nSo I think that is really what\nI want people to tune into\nand get an awareness around.\nBecause once you tune into\nit, you can see it a lot.\nAnd then when you begin\nto see it, you have an,\nif you keep the model\nof the balance in mind,\nI think it gives people\nkind of a way to imagine\nwhat they're experiencing\non a neuro-biological level,\nand understand it.\nAnd in that understanding,\nget some mastery over it,\nwhich is really what this is all about.\nBecause ultimately we do\nneed to disengage, right?\nWe can't live in that\nspace all the time, right.\nWe have other things we need to do.\nAnd there are also serious consequences\nthat come with trying\nto repeat and continue\nthat experience or that feeling.\n- Yeah, so if I understand this correctly,\nwhen we find something, or\nwhen something finds us,\nthat we enjoy, that feels\npleasureful, social media, food,\nsex, gambling, whatever it happens to be,\nand we will explore the\nfull range of these,\nthere's some dopamine release\nwhen we engage in that behavior.\nAnd then what you're telling\nme is that very quickly,\n- [Anna] Yes.\n- and beneath my conscious awareness,\nthere's a tilting back of the scale\nwhere pleasure is reduced,\nby way of increasing pain.\n- Right.\n- And I've heard you say before that\nthe pain mechanism has\nsome competitive advantages\nover the pleasure mechanisms,\nsuch that it doesn't just\nbring the scale back to level.\nIt actually brings pain\nhigher than pleasure.\nCould you tell us a little\nbit more about that?\n- Yeah, yeah.\nSo what happens, again,\nso the hallmark of any\naddictive substance or behavior\nis that it releases a lot of dopamine\nin our brains reward pathway.\nLike, right, like broccoli\njust doesn't release\na lot of dopamine, just doesn't, right.\n- I'm trying to imagine, I\nwas about to say, maybe you,\nand I stopped myself because.\nBroccoli's good, it can be really good,\nbut broccoli is never amazing.\n- Right.\nBroccoli's never amazing.\n- We're never like,\n- I mean-\n- this is the most amazing broccoli.\n- Honestly we can probably\nfind somebody on the planet\nfor whom broccoli is amazing.\nAnd of course if I'm\nstarving, broccoli is amazing.\n- Rich Roll.\nRich Roll is big on plants,\nand he has a good relationship to plants.\nRich, tell us how to\nmake broccoli amazing.\nIf anyone could do it it'd be Rich.\n- Yeah, yeah.\nBut what happens right\nafter I do something\nthat is really pleasurable and\nreleases a lot of dopamine,\nis again, my brain is going\nto immediately compensate\nby down-regulating my\nown dopamine receptors,\nmy own dopamine transmission,\nto compensate for that, okay.\nAnd that's that come\ndown, or the hangover,\nthat after-effect, that moment\nof wanting to do it more.\nNow, if I just wait for\nthat feeling to pass,\nthen my dopamine will re-regulate itself\nand I'll go back to whatever\nmy chronic baseline is.\nBut if I don't wait, and\nhere's really the key,\nif I keep indulging again\nand again and again,\nultimately I have so much\non the pain side, right,\nthat I've essentially reset my brain\nto what we call like an anhedonic,\nor lacking in joy type of state,\nwhich is a dopamine-deficit state.\nSo that's really the way\nin which pain can become\nthe main driver, is because\nI've indulged so much\nin these high reward\nbehaviors or substances,\nthat my brain has had to compensate\nby way down-regulating my own dopamine,\nsuch that even when I'm\nnot doing that drug,\nI'm in a dopamine deficit state,\nwhich is akin to a clinical depression.\nI have anxiety, irritability,\ninsomnia, dysphoria.\nAnd a lot of mental\npreoccupation with using again,\nor getting the drug.\nAnd so that's the piece\nthere, there's the single use,\nwhich easily passes, but it's\nthe chronic use that can then\nreset really our dopamine thresholds,\nand then nothing is enjoyable, right?\nThen everything sort\nof pales in comparison\nto this one drug that\nI want to keep doing.\n- And that one drug\ncould be a person, right?\nI mean, I\n- Yes.\n- I know people in my life\nthat are still talking\nabout this one relationship,\nthis one person that was just so great,\ndespite all the challenges of that thing.\nIt's almost like they're\naddicted to the narrative.\n- Yeah.\n- They were maybe, or still\nare, addicted to the person.\nSo it could be to any number\nof things, video games, sex,\ngambling, a person, a narrative.\nTo me, and because of the way\nyou describe this mechanism,\nthis pleasure pain balance,\nthat all speaks to the\nkind of generalizability\nof our brain circuitry.\nAnd this is something that fascinates me,\nand I know it fascinates you as well,\nwhich is that nature did not\nevolve 20 different mechanisms\nfor 20 different types of addiction.\nJust like anxiety is a couple\nof core sets of hormones\nand neurotransmitters and pathways,\nand one person is triggered\nby social interactions,\nanother person is triggered by spiders.\nBut the underlying response is identical.\nIt sounds like with addiction as well,\nthere may be some nuance,\nbut that there's sort of\na core set of processes.\nSo it doesn't really matter if\nit's gambling or video games\nor sex or a narrative\nabout a previous lover\nor partner, whatever.\nIt's the same addictive\nprocess underneath that.\nIs that correct?\n- Yes, exactly.\nAnd that's where this whole idea\nof cross-addiction comes in.\nSo once you've been\naddicted to a substance,\nseverely addicted,\nthat makes you more\nvulnerable to addiction\nto any substance.\n- And when you say\nsubstance, does the same,\nis what you just said\nalso true for behaviors?\n- Yes, so, when I use the word drug\nI'm talking about substances\nand behaviors really.\nI'm talking about behaviors\nlike gambling, sex, you know,\n- Porn.\n- gaming, porn,\nabsolutely, shopping.\n- Work.\n- Work.\n- You've accused me, I'll\njust, for the record,\nAnna, Dr. Lembke's accused\nme, not accused me,\nhas diagnosed me outside the\nclinic, in a playful way,\nof being work-addicted.\nYou're probably right.\nThe first thoughts I have when I wake up\nare typically about work.\nCertainly within 50\nmilliseconds or so of waking.\nAnd probably the last thoughts I have,\nI would hope are not about work, but yeah,\nI work constantly.\nI do other things, but I have\nto actively turn that off.\n- Yes.\nThat's exactly right.\nAnd you're certainly not alone in that.\nAnd of course-\n- At Stanford, no, no no no.\n- And we're here in Silicon Valley, right,\nit's highly rewarded, right.\nSo that kind of addiction.\n- It's embedded\nin the culture.\n- Oh yeah,\nabsolutely.\n- Absolutely, yeah, yeah.\nAnd there's this other city,\nI think it's called New York,\nwhere they also work a lot I hear,\nand it's heavily rewarded.\nI once said, and I'm sure\nthat I'm not the first person\nto say it, but I was\nthinking about addiction,\nand I was thinking about\nthe underlying circuits\nand I posted something to\nsocial media which said that\naddiction is a progressive narrowing\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nThat was the way that\nI kind of crystallized\nthe literature in my mind.\nAnd then we met and you of course came and\ngave these amazing lectures\nin the neuroanatomy course\nfor the medical students,\nand the rest is history.\nBut I tossed out a kind of\nmirroring statement for that\nas well, which was a bit\noverstepping, I admit,\nwhich I said, addiction\nis a progressive narrowing\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nAnd I said, dare I say,\nenlightenment is a progressive expansion\nof the things that bring you pleasure.\nNot that anybody knows\nwhat enlightenment is,\nbut it was my attempt to\ntake a little bit of a jab\nat the fact that nobody knows.\nAnd so why not, why wouldn't I throw\na neurobiological explanation?\nJust to kind of sample the waters.\nAnd people had varying levels\nof response but I would've,\nthe reason I bring that up is that\nI would imagine that being\nable to derive pleasure\nfrom many things would\nbe a wonderful attribute.\nYou know people like this,\nthat can experience\npleasure in little things\nand in big events.\nNot just, you know, the\nbig milestones of life,\nbut also the subtle, you know, as the,\nlike the yogis would say,\nthe subtle ripples of life.\nIf such an ability exists,\ndo you think that that reflects\na healthily tuned dopamine system?\nOne that can engage and\nenjoy, but then disengage.\nIs that what we should be seeking?\nAnd to underscore,\nI know nothing about enlightenment\nmeditation, or any of it.\nI just, I use these as\nopportunities to explore.\n- Yeah, so it's a great question\nand I understand the question as,\nso what should we be striving for, right?\nWhere should we settle out?\nAnd, you know, in my book,\nI really hold out people in\nrecovery from severe addiction\nas sort of modern day\nprophets for the rest of us,\nbecause I do think that\npeople who have been addicted\nand then get into recovery,\ndo have a hard won wisdom\nthat we can all benefit from.\nAnd the wisdom, I guess, you\nknow, to distill it down,\nI mean it's many things.\nBut in terms of, you know, dopamine,\nthe wisdom is there are adaptive\nways to get your dopamine.\nAnd there are less than adaptive ways.\nAnd in general, you could\ndescribe the adaptive ways\nas not too potent.\nSo not tipping that balance\ntoo hard or too fast\nto the side of pleasure.\n- So does that mean never allowing myself\nto be absolutely in complete bliss?\nOr does it mean not allowing myself\nto stay in that state too long?\n- The latter.\nI think the latter.\nThen that gets to temperament,\nso I'm going to get that to a second.\nSo, in general, what we want is\nsome kind of flexibility in that balance,\nand the ability to easily\nreassert homeostasis.\nWe don't want to break our balance,\nwhich is possible if we overindulge\nfor enough period of time\nand end up with a balance\ntipped to the side of pain,\nthis dopamine deficit state\nwe've been talking about.\nWe want a flexible,\nresilient balance, right,\nwhich can be sensitive to things going on\nin the environment,\nwhich can experience\npleasure and approach,\nwhich can experience\npain and recoil, right?\nThis is all adaptive and\nhealthy and necessary and good.\nWe would never want a\nbalance that doesn't tilt.\n- Right.\n- That would be a disaster,\nwe wouldn't be human.\nAnd we wouldn't want that,\nit'd be really, really boring.\nOn the other hand,\nwhat people in recovery from\naddiction talk about is,\nto some extent having\nto learn to live with\nthings being a little boring\na lot of the time, right?\nSo trying to avoid some of this intensity\nand thrill-seeking and escapism,\nthat really is at the core\nof addictive tendencies.\n- Sorry to interrupt,\nbut when you say boring,\ncan we add stressful and boring?\n- Yes.\n- Because there are days where I'm not,\nI'm one of these people\nthat have to remind myself\nto have fun,\n- Yes.\n- because I sort of forgot\nwhat the term means,\nbecause I like to think that I experience\na lot of pleasure in little things,\nbut I'm a pretty hard-driving guy.\nI like goals and big\nmilestones and all that stuff.\nAnyway.\nThe point being that\nmany days I'm not bored\nthinking oh, there's nothing to do,\nbut I am kind of overwhelmed\nby the number of things\nthat are really not pleasureful\nthat I have to do.\n- Yeah, right.\n- I won't mention what they are,\n'cause I don't my colleagues to be like\nthat's why you don't respond to emails.\nNo, just your email.\nNot yours Anna, but theirs.\nIn any event,\nso anxiety and boredom can\nhang out together, right?\nAm I correct in?\n- Oh, for sure.\nI mean, actually boredom is\nhighly anxiety-provoking.\n- Okay.\nThat's good to know, 'cause\nI think people hear boredom\nand they think like, oh,\nthere's nothing to do here.\n- [Anna] Right.\n- There's nothing.\nI feel like we have a ton to do,\nwe just don't really want to do it.\n- Right, right.\n- As opposed to something\nthat we're excited to do.\n- Right, okay, so this gets to sort of\nsome of the core things.\nAlso we were talking about earlier\nabout finding your passion.\nSo I'm going to try to\nlink it all together.\nBut basically boredom,\nfirst of all boredom is a rare\nexperience for modern humans,\nbecause we're constantly\ndistracting ourselves\nfrom the present moment,\nand we have an infinite number\nof ways to do that, right.\nBut boredom is really, I think,\nan important and necessary experience.\nBut it is scary because when\nyou allow yourself to be bored,\nlet's say you were, had\nthat list of all the things\nyou hate to do, but you\nactually got them all done.\nImagine that.\nAnd you got your forthcoming book done,\nand you did all your interviews.\n- It could happen!\nLightning could strike.\n- Right.\nAnd you walked your dog,\nand you cleaned your house,\nand you went shopping.\nImagine that for a moment.\nYou would be sitting in your house,\nand my guess is you would\nbe terrified because, wow,\nwhat am I supposed to do now, right?\nThere's nothing I really have to do.\nAnd that is really, really scary.\nThat can feel like free fall.\nAnd yet that's really an important\nand good experience to have.\nAnd I think that is an experience\nout of which we can have a\nlot of creative initiative,\nbut also really consider\nour priorities and values.\nOkay, here I am on planet Earth.\nWhat the he-haw am I\ngoing to do with my life?\nWhat do I really care about?\nHow do I really want to spend my time,\nwhen I'm not distracting myself, you know,\nin order to spend it.\nAnd, you know, then this\ngets back to our conversation\na little bit earlier about\nfinding your passion.\nSo I think that one of\nthe big problems now\nthat's very misguided about this idea\nof finding your passion,\nit's almost as if people\nare looking to fit the key\ninto the lock of the thing\nthat was meant for them to do.\n- Right, and then\neverything will feel like\na natural progression?\n- Right, and then everything\nwill be wonderful.\n- I can attest to the fact\nthat is not how it works\nin any endeavor.\n- Yeah, right.\nAnd that you'll have all\nthis great success or.\nAnd here's where I really\nthink the answer lies.\nAnd I really, really believe this.\nStop looking for your passion\nand instead look around\nright where you are.\nStop distracting yourself, look\naround right where you are,\nand see what needs to be done.\nSo not what do I want to do,\nbut what is the work\nthat needs to be done?\nAnd more importantly,\nit doesn't have to be some grandiose work.\nLike does the garbage need\nto be taken out, right?\nIs there some garbage\non your neighbor's lawn\nthat someone threw there,\nthat you could actually\nbend over and pick up\nand put into the garbage can?\nLook around you.\nThere is so much work\nthat needs to be done\nthat nobody wants to do.\nThat is really, really important,\nand if we all did that,\nI really think the world\nwould be a much better place.\nAnd this is what people\nwho have severe addiction,\nwho get into recovery, realize.\nThey're like, it's not\nabout me and my will\nand what I'm going to will\nin my life or in the world.\nIt's about looking around\nwhat needs to be done.\nWhat is the work that I am\ncalled to do in this moment?\nWhich also is incredibly freeing\nbecause I don't have to\nsearch for the perfect thing.\nThere's a lot of burden\nnow on young people,\nthat they have to find that perfect thing,\nand until they've found\nthat perfect thing,\nthey're going to be miserable.\nYou don't have to do that.\nLook at the life you were given,\nlook at the people around you,\nlook at the jobs that\npresent themselves to you\nand do that job simply and\nhonorably, one day at a time,\nwith a kind of humility.\nI think this is really\nwhat's so striking to me\nabout the wisdom of people in recovery.\nThere's this incredible humility\nthat comes out of that experience.\nYou feel so broken, so ashamed,\nbut you pick yourself up one day at a time\nand you build a life that's around\nwhat can I do right in this moment,\nthat might benefit another\nperson, and thereby benefit me?\n- Yeah it's a really important\npoint, and if you're willing,\nI'd like to actually stay\non this issue of passion,\nbecause I think the dopamine systems,\nif I understand them correctly,\nthe dopamine systems merge with this work\nthat you're referring to,\nthis immediacy of things calling to us,\nlike taking out the trash,\nwhich sounds frankly really\nboring, to be honest.\nI hate taking out the trash, but I do it,\n'cause I like a clean home\nand I like a home that smells good.\nOr at least doesn't smell bad.\nSo we do these things, and\nnot that we want to offer\nsome larger carrot as a\nconsequence of doing those things.\nBut if I understand correctly,\nwhat you're saying is\nin the act of looking at\none's immediate environment,\nacting on that immediate environment,\nwe cultivate a relationship\nto these circuits in our brain\nabout action and reward\nthat, at least to my mind,\nspan the range of small\nthings being rewarding,\nand then lead us to the\nbigger things being rewarding.\nIt's not like all we're\ngoing to do is take out trash\nand tend to house.\nWe eventually will venture out,\nand we eventually will find\ncareers and work on those.\nBut if I understand correctly,\nyou're talking about getting\ninto a sort of functional\nor adaptive action step,\nand it's the action step that\nthese days we tend to overlook\nbecause most of our mindset is in things\nthat are truly outside\nof our immediate reality.\nDo I have that correct?\n- Yeah, that was beautifully said.\nAnd I would just add to that,\nI see a lot of young\npeople who, for example,\nspend most of their waking\nhours playing video games,\nand they come to me and they say\nI am anxious and depressed.\nI'm majoring in computer science.\nI hate it, I thought I would like it.\nYou know, if I could only find that thing\nthat I was really meant to\ndo, my life would be better.\nAnd my first intervention for\nthe many many people like that\nthat I see in clinical care\nis, you have it backwards.\nI don't say it quite like that.\nYou were waiting for that thing\nto pull you out of the video game world.\nAnd you're never going to find it,\nas long as you're playing video games.\n'Cause video games are so\npowerfully dopaminergic\nthat you have this distorted sense of\nreally pleasure and pain.\nAnd you will not be able to\nfind that thing that you enjoy.\nAnd so of course the intervention is\nabstain from video games,\nreset your reward pathways,\nstart with a level balance.\nAnd what invariably happens,\nand I've just seen it over\n20 years so many times\nI've become really a believer in this,\nall of a sudden it's like oh wow,\nmy computer science class\nis interesting this quarter.\nIt's like okay, you know,\nyou have a receptivity then\nto experiencing pleasure and reward\nin a way you just don't have\nwhen you're bombarding\nyour reward pathways\nwith these high dopamine drugs.\n- Very interesting.\nAnd just to underscore this notion\nthat tending to the immediate things\ncan lead to super performance.\nI may have mentioned it\nearlier this episode,\nbut if I didn't I'll mention it now,\nwhich is I have the great privilege\nof having some close friends\nthat were in the SEAL teams\nand doing some work\nwith those communities.\nAnd it's a remarkable community\nfor reasons that I think\nmost people don't understand.\nPeople think, they see the images,\ncarrying logs down the\nbeach, and all this,\nblowing stuff up, all the stuff that's fun\nfor guys like that.\nBut all of the guys I know\nwho were in the SEAL teams\nhave this sense of duty\nabout immediate things,\nand not just holding the door and doing,\nhelping with the dishes\nand moving things around.\nThey are constantly\nscanning their environment\nfor what can be done.\n- Ah!\n- They essentially conquer\nevery environment they're in.\nThey are also some of the\nmost competitive human beings\nin the world, and they do it,\nunless they're in the act of war fighting,\nwhich is their real job.\nThey do it in every environment,\nin a very benevolent way.\nAnd it's a remarkable thing because it,\nI think it's what is part of\nwhat they're selected for.\nAnd, you know, there's a range there.\nBut I think when we hear about\ntending to the immediate things,\nor this phrase, you know,\nhow you do one thing\nis how you do anything.\nThat's a tricky one for me,\nbecause there are certain\nthings I just don't do well.\nBut should we always be trying?\nI think that the tending to,\nsetting the horizon in closely\nand tending to things in\none's immediate environment,\nI think is very powerful and translates,\n- Yes.\n- because again,\nI think the nervous system,\nit performs algorithms.\nIt has action steps.\nThe brain doesn't evolve to do one thing,\nit evolves to be able\nto use the same approach\nto doing lots of different things.\n- Yes.\nI just want to add, so even beyond that,\n'cause that totally resonates for me,\nand is very consistent with people\nin recovery from addiction\nwho learn to take it one day at a time,\nwhich is one of the, you know,\nstandard lingo from Alcoholics Anonymous\nand other 12-step groups.\nBut I think also, as you say, you know,\nour brain is really wired\nfor the 24-hour period.\nWe're not very good at sort\nof the, you know, 10 year, 20.\nI mean we have this huge frontal lobes\nand yes, we're great planners and we can,\nbut if we live too much in that space,\nwe can really get very anxious\nand depressed and lost,\nand either catastrophize or get grandiose.\nBut if you can chunk it down to a day,\nwhat people in recovery talk about is how,\nif I can just do today right,\nthen I will get a chain of days\nthat seem insignificant\nin their individual units,\nbut after six months\nor a year or two years\nof those good days, I've got\ntwo very good years, right,\nand I look back and it's like oh wow,\nI guess I did all that.\nBut I think that's really,\nyou know, one of the keys,\nis really taking it one day at a time,\nwhich your SEALs,\nand also this connecting\nwith the environment, right?\nSo being awake and alert\nto your environment,\nand connecting with your environment,\nnot trying to escape it.\nAnd of course escapism is\nwhat we all want and desire,\nthat experience of non being.\nAnd we get it from the\ninternet or from drugs\nor whatever it is, but\nit's the booby prize.\nBecause ultimately it takes\nyou further and further away\nfrom your immediate environment,\nwhich is where we really have to connect\nto get that sense of\ngrounded-ness and authenticity,\nand like of being in our own lives.\n- Well I think the unit of the day\nis something that comes\nup again and again,\nin my discussions with colleagues\nwho are extremely successful,\nand who also have balanced lives.\n- Right.\n- This actually came up in the discussion\nwith Karl Deisseroth, who is\nalso a successful scientist\nand clinician and, you know,\nmanages a family, et cetera.\nSo the unit of the day,\nI think, is fundamental.\nAnd those stack up, as you mentioned.\nSo along those lines,\nI've heard you say that in order to reset\nthe dopamine system,\nessentially in order to\nbreak an addictive pattern,\nto become un-addicted,\n30 days of zero interaction\nwith that substance,\nthat person, et cetera.\n- Right.\n- Is that correct?\n- Yeah, and 30 days is,\nin my clinical experience,\nthe average amount of time it takes\nfor the brain to reset reward pathways\nfor dopamine transmission\nto regenerate itself.\nThere's also a little bit of science\nthat suggests that that's true.\nSome imaging studies showing that\nour brains are still in\na dopamine-deficit state\ntwo weeks after we've been using our drug.\nAnd then a study by Schukit and Brown\nwhich took a group of depressed men\nwho also were addicted to alcohol,\nput them in a hospital where they,\nthey received no treatment for depression\nbut they had no access\nto alcohol in that time.\nAnd after four weeks,\n80% of them no longer met\ncriteria for major depression.\nSo again, this idea that\nby depriving ourselves\nof this high dopamine high\nreward substance or behavior,\nwe allow our brains to\nregenerate its own dopamine,\nfor the balance to really equilibrate.\nAnd then we're in a place\nwhere we can sort of enjoy other things.\n- So that progressive narrowing\n- Right.\n- of what brings one pleasure,\neventually expands.\nSo I'd like to dissect out that 30 days\na little more finely.\nAnd I also want to address\nhow does one stop doing\nsomething for 30 days,\nif the thing is a thought?\nSo we'll kind of, I'll put that\non the shelf for the moment.\nSo days one through 10,\nI would imagine will\nbe very uncomfortable.\n- [Anna] Yes.\n- They're going to suck\nbasically, to be quite honest,\nbecause the way you described\nthis pleasure pain balance,\nto my mind says that if you remove\nwhat little pleasure one is\ngetting, or a lot of pleasure\nfrom engaging in some\nbehavior, that's gone.\nThe pain system is really ramped up.\nAnd nothing is making me feel good.\nI'll just use myself as an example.\nI'm not in recovery but, you know,\nthat 10 days is going to be miserable.\nAnxiety, trouble sleeping,\nphysical agitation.\n- Yes.\n- To the point where,\nyou know, maybe impulsive, angry.\nShould one expect all of that?\nShould the family members of\npeople expect all of that?\n- Yeah.\nSo what I say to patients,\nand it's a really important\npiece of this intervention,\nis that you will feel worse\nbefore you feel better.\n- For how long,\nis probably the first question they ask,\nright?\n- Yes.\nAnd I say usually, in\nmy clinical experience,\nyou'll feel worse for two weeks,\nbut if you can make it\nthrough those first two weeks,\nthe sun will start to\ncome out in week three.\nAnd by week four,\nmost people are feeling a\nwhole lot better than they were\nbefore they stopped using their substance.\nSo yeah, you have to, it's a hard thing.\nLike you have to sign up for it.\nAnd I will say, obviously there\nare people with addictions\nthat are so severe that as\nlong as they have access\nto their drug or behavior,\nthey're not able to stop themselves.\nAnd that's why we have, you know,\nhigher levels of care,\n- Sure.\n- residential treatment.\nSo this is not going to be for\neverybody, this intervention,\nbut it's amazing how many people\nwith really severe addictions\nto things like heroin,\ncocaine, you know, very\nsevere pornography addictions.\nI posit this, I do it as an experiment.\nI said you know what,\nlet's try this experiment.\nI'm always amazed, number one,\nhow many of them are willing.\nAnd number two, how many of\nthem are actually able to do it.\nThey are able to do it.\nAnd so that little nudge is\nsort of just what they need,\nAnd the carrot is, you know,\nthere's a better life out there for you\nand you'll be able to taste it in a month.\nYou really will be able to begin to see\nthat you can feel better,\nand that there's another way.\n- So the way you describe\nit seems like it's hard,\nbut it's doable for most people,\nnot everybody.\n- Yeah, right.\n- And we'll return to\nthat category of people\nwho can't do that on their own.\nWell, then days 21 through\n30, people are feeling better.\nThe sun is starting to\ncome out, as you mentioned,\nwhich translates in the\nnarrative we've created here,\nand supported by biology,\nthat dopamine is starting to be released\nin response to the taste of\na really good cup of coffee,\n- Yes, exactly.\n- for instance.\nWhereas before it was\nonly to insert, you know,\naddictive behavior.\n- Right, that's right.\n- Whichever it happens to be.\n- Of course, coffee can be addictive too,\nbut we'll leave that\naside.\n- Sure, yeah.\nI feel like coffee has a kind of\nconsumption limiting mechanism built-in,\nwhere at some point you\njust can't ingest anymore.\n- Yeah.\n- But maybe that's wrong.\nSorry to give lift to the\ncaffeine addicts out there.\nAs I clutch my mug.\nSo days 21 through 30.\nI've seen a lot of people\ngo through addiction\nand addiction treatment.\nI've spent a lot of time\nin those places, actually,\nlooking at it, researching.\nI've got friends in that community.\nI'm close with that community.\nOne thing I've seen over and over again,\nsadly often in the same individuals,\nis they get sober from\nwhatever, they're doing great.\nThese are people with families.\nThese are people that you\ndiscard your normal image of an addict\nand insert the most normal, typical,\nwhatever, healthy person you can imagine.\n'Cause a lot of these people\nyou wouldn't know were addicts.\nAnd then all of a sudden\nyou get this call,\nso-and-so's back in jail.\nSo-and-so's wife is going to leave him\nbecause he drank two bottles of wine\nand took a Xanax at 7:00 a.m.,\ncrashed his truck into a pole,\nhas got two beautiful kids.\nLike how did this happen again?\nTo the point where by the\nfourth and fifth time,\npeople are just done.\nI mean maybe people,\nyou might be able to detect\nthe frustration in my voice.\nI'm dealing with this,\nwith somebody that's like,\nI don't even know that I\nwant to help this time.\nIt's been so many times,\nto the point where I'm starting to wonder\nis this person just an addict.\nThis is just kind of what\nthey do and who they are.\nAnd you never want to\ngive up on people but,\nand I'm hanging in there for them.\nBut I will say that many\npeople have given up on them.\nAnd so what I'd like to\ntalk about in this context\nis what sorts of things help other people\nthat we know that are addicted?\nWhat really helps?\nNot what could help,\nbut what really helps.\nAnd are there certain people\nfor whom it's hopeless?\nI mean, I don't like to hold\nthe conversation that way,\nbut I wouldn't be close\nto the real life data\nif I didn't ask.\nIs it hopeless, are there people who just\nwill not be able to\nquit their substance use\nor their addictive behavior,\ndespite, I have to assume,\nreally wanting to?\n- Yeah, so there are people who will die\nof their disease of addiction, you know,\nand I think conceptualizing\nit as a disease\nis a helpful frame.\nThere are other frames that\nwe could use, but I do think,\ngiven the brain physiologic\nchanges that occur\nwith sustained heavy drug use,\nand what we know happens to the brain,\nit is really reasonable to\nthink of it as a brain disease.\nAnd for me, the real window of,\nlet's say being able\nto access my compassion\naround people who are repeat relapsers,\neven when their life is so much better\nwhen they're in recovery.\n- Oh yeah, yeah.\n- It's like a no-brainer, right?\nIs to conceptualize this balance\nand the dopamine deficit state,\nand a balance tilted to the side of pain.\nAnd to imagine that for some people,\nafter a month or six months,\nor maybe even six years,\ntheir balance is still\ntipped to the side of pain.\nThat on some level that\nbalance has lost its resilience\nand its ability to restore homeostasis.\n- It's almost like the\nhinge on that balance\n- Yes.\n- is messed up.\n- Exactly.\nAnd so, I mean,\nfor someone who's never\nexperienced addiction,\nlike yourself, maybe one\nway to conceptualize it is.\n- Well I didn't say that.\n- [Anna] Oh okay.\n- To be clear, I was not\nreferring to myself, but I,\nin this example I was giving,\nif I were, I would come clean.\nI would reveal that.\nBut I think that,\nespecially after hearing\nsome of your lectures\nand descriptions of the range\nof things that are addictive,\nI think I've been fortunate\nI don't have a propensity\nfor drugs or alcohol.\n- Right, okay.\n- I'm lucky in that way.\n- Right, right.\n- Frankly, if they remove all\nthe alcohol from the planet,\nI'll just be relieved\nbecause no one will\noffer it to me any more.\n- [Anna] Right, right.\n- So don't send me any alcohol.\nIt won't go to me.\n- [Anna] Right.\n- But I don't have that,\nI like to think I have the compassion,\nbut I don't that empathy for, you know,\ntaking a really good situation,\nand what from the outside looks to be\n- Right, right.\n- throwing it in the trash.\n- Yeah, so okay, so let me,\nand this is really, I think,\nimportant because I also had to\ncome to an understanding of\nthis, and I feel that I have\nin my 20 years of seeing these patients.\nAnd of course addiction\nis a spectrum disease,\n- Sure.\n- right,\nand so you've got the\nsevere end of things.\nImagine that you had an itch\nsomewhere on your body, okay.\nAnd it was, I mean, we've\nall had that, like, you know,\nwhatever the source, it\nwas super, super itchy.\nYou can go for, you know,\nif you really focus,\nyou could go for a pretty\ngood amount of time\nnot scratching it,\nbut the moment you stopped\nfocusing on not scratching it,\nyou would scratch it.\nAnd maybe you'd do it while\nyou were asleep, right.\nAnd that is what happens to\npeople with severe addiction.\nThat balance is essentially broken.\nHomeostasis does not get restored,\ndespite sustained abstinence.\nThey're living with that\nconstant specter of that pull.\nIt never goes away.\nSo let me say, there are\nlots of people with addiction\nfor whom that does go away.\nAnd it goes away at four\nweeks for many of them.\nBut in severe cases, that's\nalways there and it's lingering,\nand it's the moment when they're\nnot focusing on not using,\nit's like a reflex.\nThey fall back into it.\nIt's not purposeful.\nIt's not because they want to get high.\nIt's not because they value using drugs\nmore than they do their family.\nNone of that.\nIt's that really they cannot not do it\nwhen given the opportunity,\nand that moment when they're\nnot thinking about it.\nDoes that make sense?\n- That's a great description\nand actually in that description\nI can feel a bit of empathy,\nbecause the way you described\nscratching an itch in your sleep.\n- Yeah.\n- You know,\nI've done that with mosquito\nbites and some of them,\n- Right.\n- you're scratching, you know,\nlike you wake up scratching\nthat mosquito bite.\nAnd I also have to admit\nthat I've experienced\nnot feeling like I want\nto pick up my phone\nbecause it's so rewarding, but\njust finding myself doing it.\n- Yes, of course,\nyes.\n- Like I'm not going to\nuse this thing, I'm not\ngoing to use this thing,\nand then just finding myself doing it,\nlike what am I doing here?\n- Yes, right, right.\n- Sort of the how did I get back\nhere again?\n- Yes, right.\n- And I know enough about\nbrain function to understand\nthat we have circuits that\ngenerate deliberate behavior.\nAnd we have circuits that\ngenerate reflexive behavior.\nAnd one of the goals of the nervous system\nis to make the deliberate stuff reflexive,\nso you don't have to make the decision,\nbecause decision-making is\na very costly thing to do.\n- Exactly.\n- Decision-making of any kind.\n- [Anna] Right, right.\n- So that does really help.\nI want to just try and weave\ntogether this dopamine puzzle,\nhowever, because if by week,\nso first phase of this 30 or 40 day detox,\nit's like a dopamine fast,\n- Right.\n- right, okay.\nFirst 10 days are miserable.\nMiddle 10 days, the clouds are out,\nthere may be some shards\nof sunlight coming through.\nAnd then all of a sudden\nsun starts to come out,\nit gets brighter and brighter.\nWhy is it then that people will relapse,\nnot just after getting fired from a job\nor their spouse leaving them,\nbut when things are going really well?\n- Yes.\n- Is it this\nunconscious mechanism?\n'Cause I've seen this before.\nThey have a great win,\nI have a friend who's a\nreally impressive creative.\nI don't want to reveal any more than that.\nAnd relapsed upon getting another\nreally terrific opportunity to\ncreate for the entire world.\nAnd I was like how can that happen?\nBut now I'm beginning to wonder,\nwas it the dopamine\nassociated with that win\nthat opened the spigot\non his dopamine system?\nBecause it happened in a phase of\na really great stretch of life.\n- Yeah, right.\nYeah, so you raise that great\npoint about triggers, right?\nAnd triggers are things that make us\nwant to go back to using our drug.\nAnd the key thing about\ntriggers, whatever they are,\nis they also release a little\nbit of dopamine, right?\nSo just thinking about\nwhatever the trigger is\nthat we associate with drug use,\nor just thinking about drug use,\ncan already release this\nanticipatory dopamine,\nthis new little mini spike.\nBut here's the part that I\nthink is really fascinating.\nThat mini spike is followed\nby a mini deficit state.\nSo it goes up and then it\ndoesn't go back down to baseline,\nit goes below baseline tonic levels.\nAnd that's craving, right?\nSo that anticipation is\nimmediately followed by\nwanting the drug.\nAnd it's that dopamine deficit state\nthat drives the motivation\nto go and get the drug.\nSo many people talk about dopamine\nas not really about pleasure,\nbut about wanting and about motivation.\nAnd so it is that deficit state\nthat then drives the locomotion to get it.\n- And earlier your description of dopamine\nbeing involved in the desire for more,\ngiving the sense of\nreward, but also movement.\n- Right.\n- I have to assume\nthat those things are braided together\n- Yes, yes.\n- in our nervous system,\nfor the specific intention of\nwhen you feel something good,\nthen you feel the pain.\n- Yes.\n- But maybe\nyou don't notice it.\nAnd then the next thing you know,\nyou're pursuing more of the thing that-\n- And I love the way you use\nthe word braided together,\nthat's beautiful.\nAnd let me also just say,\nsomething that I find also fascinating\nin my work with patients,\nand I see this all the time.\nThere are people for whom\nbad life experiences, loss,\nyou know, in any form, stress,\nin many different forms,\nthat's a trigger, but\nthere are absolutely people\nfor whom the trigger is things going well.\nAnd the things going well can be like\nthe reward of the things going well,\nbut very often what it\nis is the removal of\nthe hypervigilant state\nthat's required to keep\ntheir use in check.\nSo it's the sense of I want\nto celebrate, you know,\nor I want to, this reward happened,\nI want to put more reward on there.\nAnd it's really really fascinating\nbecause when people\ncome to that realization\nabout themselves, that\nthey're most vulnerable\nwhen things are going well,\nthat's really a valuable insight\nbecause then they can\nput some things in place\nor barriers in place\nor go to more meetings\nor whatever it is that they do, you know,\nto protect themselves.\n- Along those lines, I have\na friend 40 years sober,\nwas a severe drug and alcohol\naddict from a very young age.\nReally impressive person,\ndoes a lot of important\nwork in the kind of\nat-risk youth community out in Hawaii.\nAnd he said something to me, he said,\nas former addicts often do,\nthey've got these great sayings.\nBut I think it fits very well\nwith what you're describing.\nHe said, you know, no\nmatter how far you drive,\nyou're always the same\ndistance from the ditch.\nAnd I said well that's kind\nof depressing, and he said no,\nthat's actually what gives me peace.\n- Yeah.\n- Because what would happen is\nfor so many years of\nrelapsing and relapsing,\nrecovering and relapsing, he\nfelt like it was hopeless.\nAnd then somehow conceptualizing that\nthe vigilance can never go away,\ninstead of making him feel burdened,\n- Yeah.\n- it made him feel relieved.\nSo I often think about\nthat statement, you know,\nno matter how far you drive,\nyou're always the same\ndistance from the ditch,\nbecause in my mind I\nconceptualize that as gosh,\nthat's a tough way to drive down the road.\nBut actually, on a road where\nyou know where the ditch is\nand where you know where\nthe lanes lines are,\nit's actually a pretty nice drive.\nIt's when you don't know\nwhere the shoulder is,\nthat you constantly have\nto be looking around.\nSo there's this, we're\nspeaking now in analogies\nand imagery and science.\nBut I, one of the things\nI find so incredible\nabout this community of 12-step,\nand there are a variety of them,\nare the communities that\nthey create for themselves,\nand some of these sayings,\nwhich I do believe link back\nto really core biological mechanisms.\n- Yes, yes.\n- I do want to ask\nabout those communities.\nI have a question which might\nbe a little bit controversial.\n- Great!\n- Which is, is it possible that people\nwho were addicted to drugs\nor alcohol or gambling,\nor some other behavior,\nget addicted to the addiction community?\nBecause one thing that I\nthink I observe over and over\nis that there's some circuit\nin the brain of human beings\nthat has to tell you about\nthe dream they had the night\nbefore, for whatever reason.\nThere's another circuit that\nleads people to wake you up,\nif they themselves can't sleep.\nI don't know what circuit it is.\nI'm being facetious here.\nBut there does seem to also be a circuit\nin the brain of addicts\nto discuss and want to\nkind of talk about their recovery a lot.\nAnd I mention this not to poke at them,\nbut rather the opposite,\nbecause I think that one\nthing that is challenging,\nat least for me, and having\nfriends that have a propensity\nfor drug or alcohol\naddiction, not all of them,\nbut certainly some of them,\nis when they're talking\nabout their recovery,\nI feel like it's all they talk about.\nThis meeting, that meeting, that meeting.\nSo what I'm really asking here is that,\ncan we become addicted to sobriety?\n- Right.\nSo this is a great\nquestion and it links into\nsome of the other things\nwe've been talking about,\nhaving to do with where do\nwe settle out, you know?\nWhat is the way to live\nbetween pleasure and pain?\nAnd I implied earlier that\nultimately we want a resilient balance\nthat's sensitive to pleasure and pain,\nbut that can easily restore\nhomeostasis after we indulge,\neven when we indulge greatly.\nBut the truth of the matter is that\npeople with severe addiction,\nI believe temperamentally\nwant those extremes,\nand they're wired for\nthat kind of intensity\nthat is more than just\nthese slight adjustments\naround the fulcrum, right?\nIt's like they want the\nbig highs and the big lows.\n- They'll say great meeting.\n- Yeah, right, right.\n- They're like\nthat was such an amazing meeting.\nOr they find a group,\n- Right, yeah.\n- They find a group in a location.\n- Yeah.\n- This is almost an inside\njoke in those communities.\nAgain, I'm not reporting,\nI'm not talking about a friend in quotes,\nthis isn't me reporting.\nThey'll talk about how\nattractive people are\nat a given meeting, or\nhow bonded they feel\nto people at a given meeting.\n- Right, right.\n- That the meetings themselves\n- Right.\n- become their own form\nof dopamine hit.\n- Yes, yes, yes.\n- And again, I'm not\nbeing disparaging, I just,\nI want to understand this.\n- Right, so yes, so a lot of\ntimes patients will say to me,\noh, you know, I don't want to go to AA.\nIt's a cult.\nAnd my response to that is\nbecause it's a cult is\nexactly why it works, okay.\nBecause yes, it is much better\nfor you to be addicted to AA\nand to recovery,\nthan almost any other\naddiction I could think of.\nAnd we know from Rob Malenka's\nwork, who's here at Stanford,\nthat oxytocin, you know,\nis the hormone that's\ninvolved in human pair bonding\nand relationships and love.\nAnd it directly links to dopamine neurons\nand causes the release of dopamine.\nSo yes, when we connect with other humans,\nespecially in a kind of\ntranscendent spiritual way,\nthat's a huge dopamine hit.\nAnd it does replace the dopamine\nthat people get from drugs.\nAnd for people who have\nthis addiction temperament,\nthey need it on a more intense level.\nThey're not going to be\ngenerally satisfied with kind of,\nyou know, a sort of\nacquaintanceship, right?\nThey want that intensity of\nthe intimacy that you get\nwith people when you're\ncathartically exposing, you know,\nwarts and all.\nSo yes, people can get\naddicted to recovery,\nand good for them.\nGo for it, you know.\nAnd of course this can be disruptive\nfor friendships and relationships,\nwhere the one person is not in recovery.\nLike you're going to so many meetings,\nyou're always talking about\nrecovery, but you know what,\nmuch better than them\nbeing intoxicated, right?\nI mean, so although you\nmay tire of your friends\ntalking about their meetings all the time,\nI'm sure you would\nrather have them do that\nthan, you know, be in their addictions.\n- Absolutely.\nAnd this is now the second\ntime you've done this\nthrough this discussion,\nbut now I have empathy\nbecause the way you describe\ntheir enthusiasm about meetings,\n- Yes.\n- is probably the way\nthat people feel about me\nand work.\n- Yes, right.\n- In neuroscience.\n- Yes.\n- I mean, I've been getting\nup in front of the class\nsince I was eight years old\nand talking about things\nI read over the weekend.\nNow I just happen to have\nthis thing called a podcast.\n- Right.\n- I've been doing it since I was a little.\nAnd it annoys a lot of people, right.\nI've learned to suppress it a little bit.\nSome people like it, but\nI'm poking fun at myself\njust to say that I now can understand\nthat the way I feel\nabout the reports about\nyet another amazing meeting or,\nor for there's a different form of this.\nBut there's some people for which\nthey just love intense experiences.\n- Yes.\n- They're always like\ntrying to pull me off to Bali\nbecause they're talking\nabout how sensual it is\nall the time, I'm sure Bali's wonderful.\nBut there's this kind of ratcheting up,\nit's like seeking Burning Man\nall year long.\n- Right.\n- I've never been to Burning Man,\nno desire to go to Burning Man.\nBut inside of academia\nI mean if I were to just\nturn the mirror at myself,\ninside of academia, or\nhere in Silicon Valley,\nwork, and the\n- Right.\n- pursuit of more success,\neven if money is kind\nof divorced from that,\nsometimes it is sometimes it isn't.\nAcademic work is, you know,\nfor sake of pursuit of knowledge.\nIt sounds to me like the same mechanism.\nIn fact, it feels to me very\nmuch like the same mechanism.\n- So Andrew, here's what I love about you.\nFirst of all, you're willing\nto bring your own flaws\nand foibles to this conversation.\n- Well they're everywhere.\n- Well, you know what, it's wonderful.\nAnd then you're really open and curious\nand wanting to understand,\n'cause I can't tell you\nhow many people I have met\nwho really see addiction\nas some kind of otherness.\nBut the truth is we're\nall wired for addiction.\nAnd if you're not addicted yet it's just,\nit's right around the corner.\nDo you know what I mean?\nEspecially with the incredible\npanoply of new drugs\nand behaviors that are out there.\nSo I love that you're\nwilling to take a moment\nand really try to understand\nthis, because it is,\nwe can all relate, and\nyou're relating it to your,\nessentially your work\naddiction is right and apt.\nYou just happen to be\naddicted to something\nthat is really socially rewarded.\nYou know, you figured\nthat out at an early age.\nOh, when I do X, Y and\nZ, all these people go\nlook at that smart kid, or\nwhatever it is, you know.\n- Well for me, it made me feel safe.\n- Okay.\n- I felt like.\nYeah, I just felt like this,\nand I pause there 'cause\nit's like, it's like peace.\nI'm like ah, I can relax for a moment.\n- When you're talking about neuroscience?\n- Or just when I feel like\nI'm on the right path.\n- Yeah, okay.\n- And I'm onto something.\nOr if I see something\nthat I'm excited about,\n- Right.\n- I'm like, I feel filled\nwith, it must be dopamine.\n- Yes.\n- I feel\nflooded with pleasure,\nliterally from head to toe.\n- Right, yeah.\n- And then my next thought is more.\n[laughing]\n- So true, you're a true addict.\n- Okay, thank you.\n- You are.\nYou are.\nBut you just got really,\n- I think thank you.\n- you really got lucky with the fact that\nwhat you're drawn to is\nadaptive, essentially, you know.\nAnd then your challenge\nis going to be that\nyour life doesn't get too out of balance\nin the sense that you're 24/7 working,\nyou don't stop and do some\nother things or think of-\n- And my life, admittedly,\nis somewhat asymmetric.\nI mean it has other\ncomponents of physical health,\net cetera, but it is somewhat asymmetric.\nWhich is why I got a dog.\nAlthough I talk about\nhim an awful lot, so.\n- But the dog is good because\nthat draws you out of yourself\nand a little bit away from the work.\nBut again, you know, I\nthink the key here is\nfor people who feel like they don't,\nthey've never experienced addiction\nor they don't know anybody with addiction,\nor if they do, they don't get it,\njust think of that one thing\nthat is the most important\nthing in your life that you do,\nthat gives you pleasure\nand meaning and purpose.\nAnd then imagine if you couldn't do it.\n- Oh yeah, let's not talk about that.\n- [Anna] Right.\n- Well I appreciate the feedback\nand you can send me a bill at the end.\nWhat is the most ridiculous\nsounding addiction\nthat you've ever witnessed,\nthat was actually a real\naddiction, along these lines.\nBecause I think we all know\nthe standard heroin, pill.\nYou've been very, I should mention,\nbecause it's important,\nyour previous book,\nand we will provide a\nlink to that as well,\nfocused on the opioid crisis\nand what we thought was medication.\nIt turned out to be just\nas bad, if not worse,\nthan a lot of so-called street drugs.\nSo we understand those,\nyou know, gambling,\nsex addiction, porn addiction.\nNow video games.\nWe'll talk about social media\na little bit more in depth.\nBut what's the most like, wow,\nI didn't realize people\ncould get addicted to that?\n- Water.\n- Really?\n- Really.\nSo I had a very lovely patient who was,\nhad a severe alcohol addiction,\nand she got into recovery\nfrom her alcohol addiction\nfor many years.\nBut she kind of had a\nsort of a polydipsia,\nor an urge to be drinking something a lot.\nAnd so she drank a lot of\nwater and slowly, over time,\nshe realized that if\nshe drank enough water,\nshe could become\nhyponatremic and delirious\nand be out of herself.\n- You can die from it, right?\n- Right, which is,\nshe just wanted to be out of her own head.\nAnd so she would\nperiodically intentionally\noverdose on water, in order, you know, to,\nI know, it was so sad, so sad.\n- What happened to her?\n- She eventually took her own life.\n- Wow.\n- Yeah, it was really.\n- That's rough.\n- She was a lovely woman.\nShe was so bright.\nShe had so many interests and passions,\nand of course it was very sad\nwhen, you know, when she died.\nBut that was a wow to me, it was like wow,\nif you have this disease of addiction,\nyou can even get addicted to water.\n- Wow.\nAnd I think it just underscores\nthe generalizability\nof the circuits.\n- Right.\n- There isn't a brain circuit\nfor addiction to water\nthat she happened to have.\nThere's a brain circuit for\npleasure and pain and addiction,\nand water plugged into\nthat circuit.\n- Right, right.\n- Wow.\nThat's intense.\nIn your book, \"Dopamine Nation\",\nyou also describe some\namazing paths to recovery.\nPeople that, you know,\nfrom reading it I would,\nI won't say which ones and who\n'cause there are some great\nsurprises in the book too,\nboth tragic and triumphant, as they say.\nYou've often described your\npatients as your heroes.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, tell us\na little bit more about that.\n- You know, when you\nthink about how hard it is\nto give up a drug or a behavior\nthat you're addicted to,\nhow much courage that takes\nand fortitude and discipline,\nand stick to it-ness,\nthese people are really amazing people.\nI mean that's, I don't\nknow that I could do it,\nwhat they do, you know.\nAnd like, you know, we\ntalked a little bit about\njust the constant\never-present urge to use,\neven after sustained periods\nof abstinence for some people.\nThat's really really hard.\nAnd of course then you double down\non the shame that they\nfeel, because of that urge,\neven when their lives are so much better.\nI mean these people are\nreally, really remarkable.\nAnd you take their\nremarkable accomplishment\nand then you imagine the\nworld that we live in now,\nwhere we are constantly\ninvited and tempted\nand really bombarded with opportunities\nto become addicted-\n- It's like feeling an itch everywhere.\n- Oh yeah, I mean you can't escape it.\nYou know, you cannot escape it.\nThat you'll get an email in your inbox\ninviting you to do X, Y, or Z.\nAnd if you're addicted\nto that thing, you know,\nyou try to like delete all\nyour apps and not go here.\nAll of a sudden your work inbox, you know,\nyou're getting those images, let's say.\nReally, really, really hard.\nAnd yet these people find a way to do it.\nI think it's absolutely amazing.\nAnd they're really wise people.\nThey have so much wisdom to offer.\nThey've taught me a lot.\nYou know, as I talk about in my book\nI have my own addictions,\nand I really just like took\na page right out of their,\nI was okay, what do I do now?\nAll right, what did this\npatient do, what did that,\nokay, I'm going to try that.\n- It is an amazing community\n- Yeah.\n- of people,\nthey are very sage.\nI wanted to just touch on\nsomething that you mentioned,\nwhich is the shame.\n- Yeah.\n- You know you can't go to a\nmeeting, or talk to addicts,\nwithout detecting or hearing about\nlike lies, shame, et cetera.\nI heard you say in an interview\nwith somebody else recently\nthat truth-telling and secrets\nare sort of at the core of recovery.\nAnd yeah, tell us more about that.\n- Yeah.\nSo one of the things that I\nfound really fascinating about\nworking with people in recovery,\nwas how telling the truth,\neven about the merest\ndetail of their lives,\nwas central to their recovery.\nAnd I became really curious about that.\nLike why would truth-telling\nbe so important?\nAnd of course there is\nthe obvious thing that\nwhen people are in their addiction,\nthey're lying about using, you know.\nSo part of getting into recovery\nis to stop lying to the\npeople they care about,\nabout their use.\nBut it's really more than that because\nwhat people in recovery\nhave taught me is that\nit's not even just not\nlying about using drugs.\nI have to not lie about anything.\nI can't lie about why I was\nlate to work this morning,\nwhich we all do all.\nOh I hit traffic, no I didn't hit traffic,\nI wanted to spend two more\nminutes reading the paper\nand drinking my coffee, right.\nOr just lying about, you know,\nI don't know where I had dinner.\nLike, so people with addiction\nwill get into, you know,\nthe lying habit where they're\nlying about random stuff,\n'cause they're sort of\nin the habit of lying.\nAnd how recovery is really\nabout telling the truth,\nyou know, in all ways.\nAnd so one of the things that I,\nI had a lot of fun with\nin writing the book,\nis sort of exploring\nthe neuroscience around\nwhy truth-telling is important\nto leading a balanced life.\nAnd we know like every religion,\nsince the beginning of time,\nis all about telling the truth.\nWell why, right?\nAnd there's really interesting\nneuroscience behind it\nthat suggests that when we tell the truth,\nwe actually potentially strengthen\nour prefrontal cortical circuits,\nand their connections to our limbic brain\nand our reward brain.\nAnd of course, these are the\ncircuits that get disconnected\nwhen we're in our addiction, right?\nOur balance, in our reward\npathway, our limbic brain,\nour emotion brain, is doing one thing,\nand our cortical circuits\nare completely disengaged from that,\nignoring what's happening,\nwhich is easy to do\nbecause it's reflexive.\nWe don't need to think about that balance\nfor the balance to be happening.\nBut we have to re-engage those circuits,\nanticipate future consequences,\nthink through the drink, you know,\nnot just how am I going\nto feel now if I use,\nbut how am I going to feel\ntomorrow or six months from now?\nAnd that telling the truth\nis in fact a way to do that,\nto make these connections stronger.\nAnd there I talk about\nsome studies in my book\nthat kind of indirectly show that.\nSo I find that really fascinating,\nplus just that like being\nopen and honest with people\nreally does create very\nintimate connections,\nand those intimate\nconnections create dopamine.\nSo we were talking a little bit about\nhow you know a bunch of people\nwho need like intensity in their lives.\nFor me, I need a lot of intensity\nin my human connections.\nLike I'm really not interested in,\nand bored by and made anxious\nby, casual interactions.\nBut you know, like having this\nkind of discussion with you,\nthat's very intense and also\nintimate and self-disclosing,\nis very rewarding for me.\nSo that's an important source of dopamine.\nThank God I became a psychiatrist.\n- Yeah, absolutely.\n- Like I can't disclose all my stuff,\nbut I am quite transparent\nwith my patients,\nwhich is a slightly unorthodox.\nBut, you know, when I think it's right,\nI'm also transparent with them.\nSo that's, you know, that's\na source of dopamine too,\nwhen we're honest and we disclose.\nYou think people are going\nto run away from you,\nif you tell them about all\nlike your weird neuroses,\nbut really they don't.\nWhat they're like is oh thank God,\nI'm not the only one, right.\n- What I love about, I love\nmany things about your book.\nI read it in one sweep.\n- Oh thank you.\n- And I was like wow.\nI was pleasantly surprised,\nbut I was like wow,\nshe's really opening up in this book,\nfrom the very beginning.\nAnd I don't want to give\nit away, but it's yeah,\nyou're very open where it's appropriate.\nAnd also I think that this\nquestion about truth-telling,\nI always think about like tell the truth,\nbe a hundred percent about the truth,\nbut there's also this element about\ndo you report previous lies, right?\nWhat about prior behavior?\nAnd I'm fascinated by this\n'cause to me telling the truth\nhas many facets, but the\nthree sides of this thing\nin my mind, are one is\nreporting everything accurately.\nThe other is what do you withhold,\nwhat do you not withhold, right?\nBecause some people say tell the truth,\nor at least don't lie.\nThat's sort of a-\n- Lies of omission, right.\n- Yeah, so lies of omission.\nLies of omission.\nAnd then there's the, what I\nhave to assume for most people,\nis a small to enormous batch of things\nthat they lied about in the past,\nthat still thread into the future.\n- Right.\n- So how important is it for the addict,\nor every person really, to,\n'cause it sounds like\ncultivating the circuitry\nbetween prefrontal cortex\nand the dopamine system\nwould be great for anybody.\nSince we're all addicts,\n- Right.\n- everyone should do it.\nBut in all seriousness,\nit sounds like a good\nthing for everybody to do.\nHow much work needs to be\ndone on all the priors,\nall the stuff we've hidden?\nI mean not me, but all the stuff\nthat everybody else has hidden.\n- Yeah, so the, you know,\nthe steps of the 12-steps\nof Alcoholics Anonymous,\na good number of those steps\nare about that very thing.\nThe past, the ways that we've\nharmed people in the past.\nAnd the fourth step is\nabout making amends,\nyou know, by admitting the ways in which\nthat we've contributed to harming others.\nAnd it is a really big piece of recovery.\nSo, you know, how important,\nso for people with addiction,\nit's really, really important\nto go back and make amends.\nAnd, you know, the key idea there is\nyou just go back and\nyou apologize, you know,\nand you don't have to get any\nparticular kind of response,\nor you don't need to be forgiven.\nIt's the act itself of apologizing\nabout the ways in which we've harmed\nor lied to people in the past,\nthat is cathartic and renewing,\nand allows us to kind of shed this skin\nand be new in our lives and begin again.\nSort of absolved, you know,\nof past sins, so to speak.\nSo it is really important.\nYou know, are there situations\nwhen it's maybe not a good idea,\nbecause of that person or the nature?\nSure, you know, there\nare always going to be,\nit doesn't have to be like, it's not,\nwe're talking about not\nlike Kant's idea about\nI'd never lie, robbers in your house.\nYou're a stowaway.\nYou can't lie even about that.\nIt's like no, there are\nprobably situations where,\n- Absolutely.\n- you know.\n- For sake of other people's safety,\n- Right, and-\n- children's safety, sure.\n- Right, I mean there are,\nyou can think of a million scenarios.\nBut in general, you know,\nwhen we're taking stock,\nbecause I don't know about you,\nbut I have a lot of regrets and guilt\nabout a lot of things in my life.\nAnd they kind of haunt me, you know.\nIt means I'll have nightmares, right.\nAnd I think that's true for most people.\nI mean I occasionally will\nmeet somebody who's like\nI don't have any regrets\nin my life, I'm like wow.\nLike I cannot relate to that at all.\nSo, you know, this idea of\nlike catharsis and, well,\nI mean, in the 12-steps it's telling God,\nor your higher power,\ntelling another human being,\nthe ways in which you've wronged others.\nConsidering your own character defects\nand how those have contributed.\nTo me, that's a really important piece\nand something that we don't do enough\nin our current culture.\nEspecially in psychiatry, frankly,\nwhere there's like a lot of\neternally empathizing with patients,\nbut not a whole lot of\nlikes going well, you know,\nactually you kind of messed that up.\nOr like that was really\nbad on you, you know.\nAnd in my work, I don't\nnecessarily use that language,\nbut, you know, patients might say like\nI really feel badly about,\nyou know, this thing.\nI'll be like yeah, I get it.\nI understand that you feel.\n- Well guilt is a-\n- [Anna] Right.\n- There's a circuit for that too.\n- Right, and it's important, right,\nand it's also important to recovery\nand to not becoming addicted.\nExperiencing a certain\namount of appropriate shame\nfor things that we have\ndone and, you know,\nfeeling the pain that comes with shame,\nwhich is an incredibly\npainful emotion, right.\nAnd I think that may be the\none that we all try to avoid\nmore than any other,\nis like that shame of not being\nliked or not being accepted\nor not being celebrated.\n- Or the thing that we did\nis really despicable.\n- Right, it's really,\nyeah, like oh my God,\nI did that horrible thing, right, right.\nSo, I mean, I've done horrible things\nthat I haven't gone back and\nsaid I did this horrible thing,\nbut I'm, maybe I've\ntried to pay it forward.\nLike I've told my kids, you know,\nwhen I was younger I\ndid this horrible thing\nand it still haunts me.\nSo if you're ever tempted to\ndo something like what I did,\nyou might think about my situation.\nSo, you know, some kind of way.\nBut I think wrestling\nwith that is important.\n- I think it's a really\nimportant element to all this,\nand there's not, I love that\nthere's neuroscience being done\non truth-telling,\n- Yeah.\n- and the value\nof truth-telling.\n- Yeah.\n- I think,\nif I were to predict a new\nand truly exciting area\nthat people are going to\nbe really curious about,\nin this huge sphere we call neuroscience,\nI hope they'll continue to do more work.\nAlso, I'm so glad to hear that's\nhappening here at Stanford.\n- No that's, the literature that I look at\nisn't Stanford work, but there's work.\n- Great.\n- It might be people\nat Stanford.\n- Great,\nregardless of where it's happening.\nMore of that and all the rest please.\nI want to ask you about using\ndrugs to treat drug addiction.\nThese days there's a growing interest,\nor at least discussion about ibogaine.\nPeople going down, going out of country,\nbecause I think it's still\nillegal here, or is illegal here,\ngoing out of country to, I dunno,\neither inject it or smoke\nit or whatever it is.\nOr people going and doing\nAyahuasca journeys or MDMA,\nwhich is still an illegal\ndrug in this country,\nbut there are clinical trials.\nThere are people on this campus\ndoing experimental studies.\nI don't know of clinical trials,\nbut at Johns Hopkins there are\nclinical trials, et cetera.\nSo this is a vast area, right?\nDifferent chemistries for different drugs\nand different purposes.\nBut the rationale, as I understand it,\nis take people who are in\na pattern of addiction,\nlaunch them into a experience\nthat's also chemical and extreme,\noften of the extreme serotonin\nand or extreme dopamine type.\nSo MDMA,\n- Right.\n- ecstasy for instance.\nTons of serotonin dumped,\ntons of dopamine dumped.\nHow neurotoxic, if neurotoxic,\ndebatable, et cetera, et cetera.\nNot a topic for now.\nBut a lot.\nAnd then somehow that extreme experience\nwrapped inside of a\nsupported network in there,\nwhether or not there's just someone there\nor whether or not they're\nactively working through something\nwith the patient, is\nsupposed to eject the person\ninto a life where drug use\nisn't as much of interest.\nThis violates, at a purely rational level,\nthis violates everything\nwe've talked about\nin terms of dopamine biology.\nIt would, if this arrangement\nis the way I described it,\ncause more addiction, is\nanything but a dopamine fast,\nit's a dopamine feast.\nSo we hear about successful\ntransitions through this,\nat least anecdotally, and\nmaybe some clinical studies.\nWhat is going on?\nWhat is going on?\nIt doesn't make any sense to me.\nYeah.\n- Yeah, so I think it's\ngood that you're skeptical.\nI think we all should be skeptical.\nHaving said that, there are\nclinical studies showing,\nyou know, and these are small studies\nand they're short duration,\nsmall number of subjects,\nbut, you know, taking people for example,\nwho are addicted to alcohol,\nand then having them have this,\nlet's say a psychedelic experience\nin a very controlled setting.\n- So either, typically it's\na high dose psilocybin,\nor three dose, as I saw\nit for the MAP study\nof MDMA.\n- Right.\n- Of ecstasy.\nThose are sort of the,\nseem to be the kind of,\n- Yes, the typical, right.\n- the kind of bread and butter\nof this kind of work.\n- Right, right.\nBut the thing to really\nkeep in mind is that\nthis is completely interwoven\nwith regular psychotherapy,\nand that these are highly\nselected individuals.\n- In clinical trials.\n- Right, right.\nAnd these are clinical-\n- we're referring to\nlegal clinical trials.\n- Right, right.\nAnd so, you know, I think the metaphor\nthat helps me think about this is\nthere are many ways to\nthe top of the mountain,\nand these are sort of\nlike taking the gondola\ninstead of walking up.\nIt sort of, instead of doing like\na year of psychoanalysis\nwhere you're sitting\non the couch every week\nreflecting on your life,\nit's a condensed version of\npsychoanalysis or psychotherapy,\nplus, you know, MDMA, which\ngets you there faster.\n- And creates the intimacy,\npresumably, because of the-\n- Well I think the main thing that happens\nwhen it's beneficial, is\nit just allows the person\nto get outside of their own\nhead and look at their lives\non a much broader sweep,\nand to consider themselves\nnot mired in the quotidian\nsort of details of their life,\nbut rather as a human on\nthe large planet Earth,\nin the vast universe.\nSo I think it takes,\nit's like when it works,\nit's a transformational experience\nbecause it gives the person another lens\nthrough which to view their lives,\nwhich I think for some people\nis positive and powerful,\nbecause they can come\nback from that and be like\noh my gosh, I care about my family,\nand I don't, I want X, Y, or Z for them.\nAnd I realize that my continuing to drink\nis not going to, you know, achieve that.\nSo it's almost like a\nspiritual or values-based.\nSo I think it can be very\npowerful, but having said that,\nI truly am quite skeptical\nbecause, you know,\naddiction is a chronic\nrelapsing and remitting problem.\nIt's hard for me to imagine\nthat there's something that\nworks very quickly short-term,\nthat's going to work for a disease\nthat's really long-lasting.\n- Yeah, the two addicts I know that did\nMDMA-assisted psychotherapy\nas part of this thing,\nboth got worse.\n- Yeah.\n- But the people I know who\nhad severe trauma who did this,\nwho took this approach,\nseem to be doing better.\n- Okay, interesting.\n- And so I,\nI think that the discussion,\nas we hear it now,\nis just sort of psychedelics,\nwhich is a huge category\nthat includes many different\ndrugs and compounds\nwith different effects.\nAnd we hear about trauma and\naddiction lumped together.\nAnd I think that I'm a\nsplitter, not a lumper,\nas we say in science.\nAnd I think it's going to be\nimportant for people to know\nthat this is definitely\nnot a one-size fits all\nkind of thing.\nBut it sounds like it\nmay have some utility\nunder certain conditions.\n- Yeah, I think so.\nI'm trying to be very open-minded\nabout its potential utility\nfor certain individuals.\nBut I can tell you in my clinical work,\nwhat is a very concerning\nunintended consequence\nof this narrative,\nis I have a lot of people who\nare looking for some kind of\nspiritual awakening who on their own,\nnot in the context of\nany kind of therapeutic,\npsychological work, you know,\nmicrodose or want to try\npsilocybin or MDMA with a friend\nor wherever, so they can have\nthis spiritual experience\nthat they can figure out their lives.\nThat's a disaster and\nalmost never works out well.\nAnd I've then had people who literally,\nsupposedly you can't get\naddicted to psychedelics because,\nyou know, something with the biochemistry\nwhich I don't fully understand,\n'cause it doesn't make any sense to me.\nBut I have patients clinically\nwho definitely are addicted to,\nyou know, MDMA, to micro-dosing.\nSo that's very concerning\nto me 'cause like, you know,\nPollan's \"How to Change Your Mind\",\nI respect that work, but on\nthe other hand, it's penetrated\nthe culture-\n- Michael Pollan's book.\n- [Anna] Yeah, yeah.\n- And I don't know him and\nso I don't have a problem\ntaking a stance.\nSo I'll just say my stance on that is\nthe narrative of popular authors\ncan expand and wick out so fast,\n- Yes.\n- that pretty soon people are essentially\ntaking their mental health\ninto their own hands.\nAnd I actually, I have great\noptimism for this business\nof clinical use of\npsychedelics, including MDMA.\nMatthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins\nis doing fabulous work on this.\nAnd there are others too, of course.\nBut those are controlled settings.\n- Right.\n- And the pharmacology is being tuned up.\nAnd one thing that I think is coming.\nThere are several papers\npublished recently\nin great journals like nature\nand science, et cetera,\nwhere there are scientists\nwho are removing\nthe hallucinogenic\ncomponents of these drugs\nand finding that they still\nhave the antidepressant effects.\n- Interesting.\n- And so the experience\nof a psychedelic,\nand the long-term effects\nof the psychedelic,\nmight actually be dissociable.\nAnd so, again I, and I'm\nalways careful to say\nI'm neither for something or against it.\nI just think that treading\ncarefully is what's important.\n- I agree with you, and\nI can just tell you that\nthe downstream effect\nfor the average person,\nmany of whom present in our clinic,\nis that they've misconstrued the data\non the use of psychedelics\nfor mental health conditions,\nto this idea that they're safe,\nor that anybody can take\nthem in any circumstance\nand have this kind of awakening.\nAnd that's not what the data show, right?\nThe data are these highly\ncontrolled settings, you know,\ncarefully selected patients.\nSo that's my worry, you know.\n- Sure.\nAnd I'm going to be sitting\ndown with Matthew Johnson\nat some point, and we'll discuss this.\nAnd I think that, ah,\nthat care and that cocoon\nof real clinical care, does seem to be\nan important component.\n- Yes.\n- Well I'm glad we could\ntouch on it and, you know,\nI'm sure I'll get a bunch of comments\ntelling me that, you know.\nBut I think it is\nimportant to explore things\nfrom all sides, and that's what we do,\nas scientists.\n- Yes.\n- And if Michael Pollan wants\nto chat, we can do that too.\nThat's fine.\nI very much enjoyed the book\nactually.\n- Yes, yes.\n- But I think that people run with ideas.\n- That's right.\n- They don't walk with them,\nthey sprint.\n- That's right, right.\nYeah.\n- There are a couple other\nthings I just want to touch on,\nbut they all relate to social media.\n- [Anna] Okay.\n- You were featured in\n\"The Social Dilemma\".\nIt was a powerful movie.\nI think many people\navoided seeing that movie\nbecause it reflects back on us\njust how addicted we all are\nand how manipulated we all are.\n- [Anna] Yes.\n- But it doesn't seem to\nhave changed behavior much.\nI have to say that the movie\nchanged my understanding\nand my perception,\nbut not my behavior too much.\nIf we look at addiction\nas a maladaptive thing,\nsomething that's making our lives worse\nor us less functional at\nwork and in relationships,\nI could imagine a version of social media\nwhere it's making me more connected.\nI mean this is a podcast after all.\n- Yes, yes.\n- I post videos.\nThis will show up on YouTube\nand elements of it on Instagram as well.\nSo much like sugar or other things,\nI have to imagine that\nwe need to regulate,\nnot necessarily eliminate, this behavior.\nSo I want to talk about\nwhat that looks like.\nAnd I want to talk about\nwhat you've referred to\nas this narcissistic preoccupation\nthat social media is creating.\nThat we are all far more\nkeenly aware of how we look\nand how we sound and how\nwe are being perceived,\nthan we were 10 years ago.\n- [Anna] Right.\n- So first of all, social media,\nhow addicting is it really?\nAnd what is healthy social media behavior?\n- So the first message I\nwould want to get across\nabout social media, is\nthat it really is a drug\nand it's engineered to be a drug.\nAnd it's based on, you know,\npotency, quantity, variety,\nthe bottomless polls, the likes,\nthe way that it's enumerated, all of that.\nWhich doesn't mean that we can't use it,\nbut we need to be very thoughtful\nabout the way we use it,\njust like we need to be thoughtful about\nthe way we use any drug.\nAnd so that means with\nintention and in advance,\nplanning our use, right.\nAnd trying to use it as\na really awesome tool\nto potentially connect with other people,\nand not to be used by\nit or get lost in it.\nAnd of course, you know,\npeople are going to come\nwith different propensities\nfor addiction to any drug,\nand that's true for social media too.\nSome people will have no\nproblem using it in moderation\nor using it in a way that's adaptive.\nAnd other people will\nimmediately get sucked in.\nAnd the key thing about\ngetting addicted is\nwhen it's happening, nobody\nwho's getting addicted\nthinks they're getting addicted, right.\nLet's face it, it's only after\nthe fact that we go woops,\nyou know, what was that about?\n- Remember texting and driving,\nthere are all these books\nabout texting and driving,\nhow terrible it was.\n- Yeah.\n- Even the governments\nhave largely given up.\nYou see these billboards\n- Terrifying.\n- like don't text and drive,\nor any text can wait, or whatever.\nNot worth dying for.\n- Right, right.\n- But everybody's\ntexting and driving.\n- Right and if you look at\nyoung people today, teenagers,\nI mean they're basically\ncybernetically enhanced,\nthat the phone is there.\nYou know, it's like they're talking to you\nand texting 12 friends at the same time,\nand there's no stopping it.\nI mean the genie is out of\nthe bottle where, you know,\nwe're not going back.\n- [Andrew] Right.\n- So we do need to figure out, you know,\nhow to make this tool\nsomething that's, you know,\ngoing to be good for us\nand not ultimately harmful.\nAnd I don't have all the answers\nby any stretch of the imagination,\nbut I do think, you know,\nsome of the wisdom that we have learned\nfrom using other drugs, also\napplies to social media.\nWhich is to say that we have to, again,\nput barriers in place that allow us\nto remain in control of our\nuse, which means not too much,\nyou know, not too often, not too potent.\n- Do you think in, going\nback to this idea of\nthe unit of the day being\na good attractable unit,\na manageable unit of time for most people,\nso you're saying in advance,\nso allocating two hours\nin which you're going to\nallow yourself to have\nfree reign use of the phone\nand all its apps and all its things,\nor even more restricted\nthan that, meaning okay,\nI'm only going to allow\nmyself 30 minutes a day\nto post and comment, and then\nthat's a closeout completely.\n- Yeah, so I think it's,\nit depends on the person\nand sort of a combination.\nWe talked earlier about, you know,\nhaving an itch and\nscratching yourself at night.\nWe've gotten to a point with smartphones,\npeople are pulling them out\nand they are utterly\nunconscious of doing so,\npulling them out, you know,\na couple of texts, a couple.\nThey don't know\nthey're doing it!\n- I have a friend\nwho works in, delivers babies,\nand many pregnant mothers\nwon't actually deliver\nwithout their phone in hand.\nAnd this used to be the hand\nthat was connected to their spouse.\nThis may be a comment on\nspouses more than on phones.\nBut it sounds like it's a\nkind of a security blanket\nof sorts.\n- Right, like a\ntransitional object, yeah.\n- Actually that reminds me,\nyou've referred to the phone,\nI think it's the phone,\nbut maybe it's our online\npersona or ourselves,\nas we've become sort of\ninfantile in our need for,\nit's like a baby and a bottle.\n- Right, right.\n- And so I do wonder if we have regressed,\nand I do think we've\nregressed a bit in terms of\nour online behavior.\nOur inability to act like.\nI always thought an adult\nwas somebody that can\ncontrol their behavior.\n- Yeah.\n- That's the difference\nbetween a baby and an adult.\nYou don't have to be a\ndevelopmental neurobiologist\nfor very long to understand\nthat a young organism\ncan't control its behavior,\nan older one can.\nSo to me, a mature organism,\nmature in years organism\nthat can't control its\nbehavior, is a baby.\nIt's an immature version of itself.\nAnd there's neuroscience\nto support that statement.\nI look at my own behavior\nwith the phone sometimes\nand I think, I'm a grown man.\nLike what is the problem here, right?\nYou know, I don't eat baby food,\nbut I'm acting like a baby\nwith the phone, all right,\nin the sense that I'm\nreflexively picking it up,\nI'm not being intentioned\nand deliberate with it.\nDo I need a full 30 days, Anna?\n- So yes, so-\n- 30 days away from my phone?\n- As you know, that's my recommend,\nthe full 30 days to reset.\nIf you're severely addicted,\nI recommend the 30 days.\nBut if you're just a little\nbit addicted, like most of us,\nyou probably don't need 30 days.\nIn fact, a single day, not\nonly would be challenging,\nbut probably may be sufficient.\n- My phone is off for\nsubstantial segments of the day.\n- Okay, that's great.\n- And it drives other people crazy.\nPeople expect me to respond.\nBut I don't care.\n- Yeah, right, right.\n- I really don't.\nAnd I actually take a\nlittle bit of pleasure\nin the fact that, well,\nbecause I think the\npoint I'm trying to make\nis the right one, which is that\nit's not just right for me,\nbut like why, I don't see\na clause on text messages\nor emails that say must\nbe responded to within\nX amount of time or else, or else.\nSo I take the liberty of\nreplying when I'm able to.\n- Yeah, that's right.\n- Or want to.\n- Right, which touches on\none of the big challenges\nabout social media, is\nthat as more and more of us\nare spending more and\nmore time on social media,\nwe're divesting our libidinous\nenergies, et cetera,\nfrom real-life interactions.\nSo that means even when we want to choose\nto not be online connecting,\nwe go outside and there's\nno there there, right.\nThere's nobody else there.\nSo I think our collective challenge,\nand it should be our mission,\nis to make sure that we are preserving\nand maintaining offline ways\nto connect with each other.\n'Cause if we don't do that then\nwe'll be very lonely, right,\nif we were not online.\nBut if you have a tribe of\nfolks that you can be with,\nnone of whom are on their phones\nwhile you're together for\nthat discreet amount of time,\nthen it's wonderful and liberating\nand nobody's distracted.\nAnd I think that's really the key.\nAnd I think young people are\nfiguring that out, you know.\nThey're trying to create these\nspaces or try to, let's say,\ninstead of doing a\ndopamine fast by yourself,\ndo it with your friends, right.\nThen there's the FOMO is\nless, the fear of missing out\nbecause, oh you're all doing\nthe dopamine fast together.\nSo these are some of the tricks\nthat we can come up with.\n- I like that.\n- Yeah,\nokay good.\n- I like that.\nI don't allow, I have a home\ngym and I love working out.\nI just enjoy it and always have.\nAnd I don't allow my\nphone in my gym anymore.\n- Right.\n- And I live in an area where\nI don't get any reception,\nlike two meters outside my door.\nSo all my dog walks now are just,\nand they were boring as hell.\n- Yes.\n- I also have a bulldog,\nhe doesn't like to walk.\nIt's really slow.\nAnd it was so boring for a while\n- Yes.\n- because I was so used\nto taking calls\nwhile I walk,\n- Right.\n- and it's super efficient when I do that.\nThe walks now are some of\nmy favorite part of the day,\n- Yeah, right.\n- because, and if the phone,\nif I were to get a call on one of those\nor they brought reception of the areas,\nI would be very dismayed.\n- Yeah, right.\n- So I can attest to this,\nand I don't think I'm a phone addict,\nbut I do put work into\nregulating my phone behavior.\n- Yeah, so this is the key.\nYou have to, with intention,\nprior to being in that\nsituation, think of literal,\nphysical and metacognitive barriers\nthat you can put between\nyourself and your phone,\nor whatever your drug is,\nto create these intentional spaces\nwhere you're not constantly\ninterrupting yourself,\nessentially, and distracting yourself,\nbecause I really do think,\nyou know, I think we talked\njust before we started with\nthe interview, you know,\nwe're losing the ability to\nhave a sustained thought, right?\nI mean we get so far and then,\nthen you get to that point in the thought\nwhere it's a little bit hard\nto know what's coming next.\nAnd it's very easy to check\nyour phone or check your email,\nor look something up on the internet.\nAnd then you never get that opportunity\nto finish that thought,\nwhich is really the\nsource of creative energy\nand an original thought, right.\nYou're not just reacting to\nwhat's coming at you.\n- Right, and something\nthat could contribute to the world.\n- That's right.\n- I'm a big believer that\nyou're either consuming\nor you are creating.\nAnd there is, I should\nmention, it's important,\nI do believe in neutral time.\nI think sleep is great.\nI'm a big proponent of sleep\nand I've talked a lot\nabout it on the podcast,\nI care a lot about sleep.\nAnd not just for sake of performance.\nI actually just really like sleep.\nI think that being a constant consumer\nof visual information and\ninformation of all kinds,\ncan be a problem.\nBut there's some really\ngreat sources of information\non the internet.\n- Yes.\n- And I certainly benefit\nfrom the fact that\nthose channels exist.\nNarcissistic pre-occupation.\nAm I a narcissist?\n- You know, first of all, there's healthy-\n- Or is the fact that I asked,\ndoes that take me out of,\nwould a narcissist\nnever ask that question?\n- Oh yes, a highly\nsophisticated narcissist\n- Oh I see.\n- would know to do that.\n- Well I'm not very sophisticated.\n- So there's healthy narcissism,\nwhich means that we all\ninvest our personal energies\ninto things that we care about.\nAnd if our competence in\nthat arena is threatened,\nwe would all experience\na narcissistic injury,\nand that's normal and healthy.\nBut we are living in a\nnarcissistic culture,\nI mean that's not news,\nthis preoccupation with\nindividual achievement\nand individual self-worth and\nindividual self-confidence.\nAnd I think all of that is\njust fueled by social media,\nwhere we're not just seeing ourselves,\nbut we're seeing people's\nreactions to ourselves,\nand every single, you know,\nthing we say or do, you know,\nwe get likes and this and that.\nIt's really insidious and\nit contributes, I think,\nultimately to a lot of personal shame,\nbecause we're not really\nmeant to be individuals\nbouncing around in the universe.\nWe're social animals.\nAnd we're probably generally happiest,\neven for natural contrarians among us,\nwhen we're part of a tribe, right.\nAnd if we do too much to\nkind of separate ourselves\nfrom that tribe,\nI think that the brain's natural\nand instinctive corrective\nmechanism against that\nis self-loathing and shame.\nSo, you know, it's so ironic\nbecause the culture tells\nus if we just achieve more,\nwe'll like ourselves more.\nBut the truth is actually the opposite.\nThat I think when people\nget these pinnacles\nof personal achievement,\nyou know, you have things\nlike the imposter syndrome\nor whatever, you know.\n- Or you just, you know, we're at Stanford\nafter a lot of high achievers.\n- Right.\n- Right.\nSome phenomenal, amazing\npeople like yourself\nand other colleagues of mine\nthat just, I'm always in awe.\nLike it's just amazing, like\nthe mean is shifted so high.\nAnd also people who have\namazing paths to get here,\ncoming from very little\nand accomplishing so much.\nBut it's also the pressure,\n- Yeah.\n- right.\nYou know, the way that this\ncareer was described to me\nthe day I got my job, was\none colleague of mine,\nthe late Ben Barres said,\nwelcome to schizophrenia\n'cause you're never going to\nbe able to complete anything\nwithout getting interrupted.\nThat was partially true,\nalthough I've created buffers.\nAnd the other one, very\nsuccessful scientist,\nmember of the National\nAcademy, et cetera, said to me,\nyou know, just remember, it's pinball.\nYou never win.\nThe best you can do is just keep playing.\n- Yes, right.\n- And I thought wow, okay.\nOkay.\nAnd then you just go.\n- Right.\n- But I think that\nas we achieve more, not\njust academics of course,\nbut as anyone achieves more,\nthere's the relishing\nin the accomplishment.\nThere's often the desire for more,\nbut there's also the pressure of,\nwell now I have to do this\nfor the next 30 years,\neven though I love it.\nIt's the pressure of, well,\nif the mountain is this high,\nthen how do I get here and here and here,\nand then you start shoveling more dirt on\nso you can keep climbing.\nAnd it's a lot of work.\n- [Anna] Yes.\n- And I think that the\nperception of success is that\nthere's a roar of the\ncrowd and you cruise.\nYou don't cruise.\nThey just give you more to do.\n- Right.\n- Or you give yourself\nmore to do.\n- Well what I think is, at\nleast in my life experience,\nand I've heard this from other\npeople as well, you know,\nit's that prize that we're going for,\nthat if we get it is so unsatisfying.\nAnd it's the prize that we never imagined\nthat we kind of go, well,\nhow did that happen,\nbut gee, you know, that feels good.\nAnd so I'm very, what's the-\n- It's like a mirage\n- Yeah.\n- in the one case.\n- Yeah.\n- It's almost like dopamine\ncan create these mirages.\n- Yes.\n- That there's some place\nthere.\n- That's right.\nAnd if I just, it's that pot of gold.\nIf I just-\n- Constant dopamine.\n- Right, right,\nthat's right.\n- Constant dopamine.\n- And I think, you know,\nthis really, I think,\nis related to our discussion earlier\nabout this taking it one day at time,\nor paying attention to that, you know,\n24-hour period in your environment.\nI am absolutely fascinated\nby the ways in which we accumulate\nsuccess, when we do that,\ntotally independent of\nthe desire for success.\nIt's really process-oriented.\nIt's like, where am I today?\nHow can I make today a\ngood and meaningful day,\na little bit better,\nor as good as some other days I've had?\nConstantly tweaking and experimenting\nwith this experiment that\nwe call our human existence.\nAnd when we do that in\na way that's authentic\nand paying attention and value-driven,\nwhatever our, you know,\nvalues are informed by,\nit is very, very interesting\nhow those days again\naccumulate, and you find, well,\nI guess I contributed\nsomething of value there,\nbut I wasn't trying to do that.\nYou know, I think that's really,\nI mean, what I'm so amazed\nby is like, you know,\n20 years ago when I went\nto Stanford Medical School,\nor 25 years ago, you know, I just,\nI was happy to just be a good doctor.\nI was like, I guess I'm just\ngoing to try to figure out\nhow to be a good doctor,\nI'm here to learn that.\nAnd now I see these medical\nstudents, and they're wonderful.\nThey're brilliant\nand they're\n- They are.\n- well-intentioned, all that.\nBut they're like how can I, you know,\nwrite the great American novel,\ndo my startup, go to Africa,\napply for that grant?\nYou know, it's like, really,\nI was just trying to\nlearn how to be a doctor.\nAnd it's, as you say, it's\na lot of pressure on them.\nAnd it's also kind of a weird leapfrogging\nof the real way to accomplish something.\n- Right.\n- Which isn't about like\noh how can I accomplish something.\nIt's like, what can I do today\nthat would be of service.\nRight?\nAnd then finding that of trying\nto be of service, you know,\nand not really going for recognition,\ncan sometimes lead to\nwhat people call success,\nalthough that wasn't\nwhat you were aiming for.\n- And it's all the more beautiful\nwhen it's not what you're aiming for.\n- Oh so much better, so much better.\n- Yeah, I'm a big\nbeliever that when one can\nalign their compulsion\nwith some greater good.\n- Yes, right.\n- A service to humanity\nor the planet or animals, whatever it is,\nthat's where the really\ngood stuff emerges.\nBecause there's a lot\nof reciprocity there.\nThe world starts to,\nyou're supporting the world\nand then it starts to support you in a way\nthat feels very fluid.\n- And it comes back.\nRight, and I mean that speaks to you\nlike your generosity to\nme, vis-a-vis my book.\nAnd I have to say-\n- Well, I love the book.\n- I know, it's-\n- There's like, we're not\nin a business deal folks.\nIt's just purely that I heard\nAnna lecture in my course,\nI wanted to learn more about dopamine.\nShe taught me,\nI asked her if she would\ncome on the podcast.\nTurned out she wrote this amazing book.\nShe sent me an advanced copy of the book.\nI read it in one sweep, it's incredible.\nAnd I love it.\nSo just like the eight\nyear old version of me,\nnow the 45 version of myself,\nI can't stop blabbing\nabout the things I love.\n- Well it's awesome, but I have to say,\nI have been surprised by your generosity.\nIt's not something I've\nencountered frequently at Stanford,\nwhich is a wonderful place.\nBut there is a general\nsense that if I give away\nto somebody else, I've lost something,\nwhich is not the right\nway to think about it.\nNot how you are, and also\nnot how the world works,\n'cause when we give away to other people,\nwe get back so much more.\nBut it takes a long time\nand it might not come through that path.\n- I never think about reciprocity.\nBut I was weaned by good advisers.\n- That's very nice,\n- Yeah.\n- yeah.\n- I think it just sort\nof got drilled into me\nthat the more you give, the\nbetter your immediate life is.\n- Yes, yeah.\n- And I also don't have a\nlong-term vision, you know.\nI just, I'm just excited about the book.\nI'm excited that people are learning about\nthe brain and dopamine.\nI have to admit,\nhaving grown up in\nneuroscience essentially,\nI did not understand\nthat pleasure and pain\nwere orchestrated the way that they are.\nI'm very mindful of it now.\n- Oh good.\n- And it's changed a\nnumber of my behaviors.\nI know a number of people\nare going to have questions\nand want to get in contact with you.\nYou are not on social media.\n- That's correct, yes.\n- You are true to your ideology.\nThat's great.\n- And the reason for that is just,\nI wouldn't be able to control myself.\nI mean, that really would be my drug.\nPeople are my drug, intimacy is my drug,\nand I wouldn't be able to manage it.\nAnd so just, it was just easier\nfor me to not do it at all,\nrather than try to moderate it.\n- Well the book, as you mentioned before,\nand as I can attest to, is\nit has a certain intimacy.\nPeople get to know you through the book.\nSo definitely check out the book.\nIf you have questions\nabout the book, et cetera,\nyou're welcome to send them my way.\nI will buffer you from\nall those questions.\nI'll filter them.\nAnna, Dr. Lembke, I should\nbe formal, forgive me,\nI've been referring to you\n- No no, that's fine.\n- as Anna\nthe whole way through,\n'cause we're colleagues,\nbut thank you so much for\nsharing this information.\nAnd I know I learned a ton.\nand I know everyone else is\ngoing to learn a lot more\nabout addiction and the\ngood side of dopamine.\n- That's right.\nThank you for having me.\nIt's been really, really\ngreat to talk with you.\n- Great, thank you.\nThank you for joining me for my discussion\nwith Dr. Anna Lembke.\nI hope you enjoyed it as much as I did.\nPlease be sure to check out her new book,\n\"Dopamine Nation, Finding Balance\nin the Age of Indulgence\".\nYou can pre-order it on Amazon\nor
