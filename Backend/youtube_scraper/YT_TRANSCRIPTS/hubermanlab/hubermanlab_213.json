    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome to\nthe Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n[bright upbeat music]\n- I'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we continue our\ndiscussion of the senses.\nAnd the senses we are going to discuss\nare pain and pleasure.\nPain and pleasure reflect two\nopposite ends of a continuum,\na continuum that involves\ndetection of things in our skin\nand the perception, the understanding\nof what those events are.\nOur skin is our largest sensory organ\nand our largest organ indeed.\nIt is much larger than any of\nthe other organs in our body.\nAnd it's an odd organ\nif you think about it,\nit has so many functions.\nIt acts as a barrier between our organs\nand the outside world,\nit harbors neurons nerve\ncells that allow us\nto detect things like\nlight touch, or temperature\nor pressure of various kinds.\nAnd it's an organ that\nwe hang ornaments on.\nPeople put earrings in their ears.\nPeople decorate their\nskin with tattoos and inks\nand other things.\nAnd it's an organ that\nallows us to experience\neither great pain or great pleasure.\nSo it's a multifaceted organ and it's one\nthat our brain needs to make\nsense of in a multifaceted way.\nSo today we're going to discuss all that.\nAnd most importantly, how you\ncan experience more pleasure\nand less pain by\nunderstanding these pathways.\nWe will also discuss things you can do,\nand if you wish things you can take\nthat will allow you to\nexperience more pleasure\nand less pain in response\nto a variety of different experiences.\nBefore I go any further,\nI want to highlight a particularly\nexciting area of science\nthat relates to the skin and to sensing\nof pleasure and pain,\nbut has everything to do with motivation.\nMotivation is something that\nmany people struggle with,\nnot everybody, but most\npeople experience dips\nand peaks in their motivation\neven if they really want something.\nHow should we think about\nthese changes in motivation?\nWhat do they reflect?\nWell at a very basic level,\nthey reflect fluctuations\nchanges in the levels of a\nchemical called dopamine.\nMost of us have heard of dopamine.\nDopamine is a neuromodulator\nmeaning it modulates\nor changes the way that\nneurons nerve cells work.\nMost of us have heard that dopamine\nis the molecule of pleasure.\nHowever, that is incorrect.\nDopamine is a molecule of\nmotivation and anticipation.\nTo illustrate how dopamine works,\nI want to highlight\nsome very important work\nlargely carried out by the laboratory\nof a guy named Wolfram Schultz.\nThe Schultz Laboratory has done dozens\nof excellent experiments\non the dopamine system\nand have identified something called\nreward prediction error.\nAlthough in some sense\nyou can think about it\nas reward prediction variance.\nChanges in the levels\nof dopamine depending\non whether or not you expect a reward\nand whether or not you get the reward.\nSo I'm going to make this very simple.\nDopamine is released\ninto the brain and body\nand generally makes us feel\nactivated and motivated,\nas if we have energy to pursue a goal.\nAnd it is released into the brain and body\nin anticipation of a reward.\nMeasurements of dopamine have been made\nin animals and humans.\nAnd what you find is that\nwhen we anticipate a reward,\ndopamine is released,\nwe will put in the work\nto achieve that reward.\nThat work could be mental\nwork or physical work,\nbut when the reward arrives,\ndopamine levels drop\nback down to baseline.\nThat's right.\nWhen we receive a reward,\ndopamine levels go back down to baseline.\nSo the way to envision this\nas you can just imagine\na sort of increase in dopamine\nas we anticipate something\nwe're working towards it,\nwe're working towards a goal.\nWe're excited about seeing\nsomebody or meeting somebody\nor receiving some reward\nand then the reward comes\nand dopamine goes down.\nNow that's all fine and good,\nbut there is a way to\nget much more dopamine\nout of that process and therefore a way\nto have much more\nmotivation, energy, and focus\nbecause those are the\nconsequences of elevated dopamine.\nThe way to do that is to\nnot deliver the reward\non an expected schedule.\nSo experiments have been done\nwhere there's an anticipation\nof a reward, there's work,\nand then the reward\nonly arrives every other\nor every third about of work, okay?\nSo this would be like\ngetting a pat on the head.\nIf you're a dog or a,\nperhaps a child or an adult,\nor getting a monetary reward\nonly for every third project\nor every third race that you win.\nPick any kind of goal.\nIt doesn't matter.\nThese molecules don't care\nabout what you're pursuing.\nThey are a common currency of\ndifferent types of activities.\nThat's a regular reward schedule,\nand it will not alter the\npattern of dopamine release\nthat I described before.\nHowever, if the reward\narrives intermittently\nalmost randomly, so\nyou anticipate a reward\nas a maybe it might come, it might come.\nThen you work, work, work,\nwork, work, no reward.\nYou repeat the work, work,\nwork, work, work, work,\nand then you get a reward.\nSo some trials, you do\nsome trials, you don't,\nand it's completely random.\nUnder those conditions, the amplitude,\nthe amount of dopamine that's\nreleased into your system\nand the motivation to\ncontinue working hard\nor playing whatever kind\nof game you're playing,\ndoubles or triples.\nAnd this is the basis of\nthings like slot machines\nand gambling.\nAnd this is why so many\npeople will give so much\nof their money up to casinos\nand the casinos always win.\nSometimes people walk away with more money\nthan they came to the casino with,\nbut the vast majority of the time,\nthe house wins as they say.\nAnd it's because they understand\nintermittent reward schedules.\nAnd you can apply this to stay motivated\nin your own pursuits.\nRather than thinking about\nthe pleasure of a reward,\nunderstand that dopamine\nis released in response\nto anticipation reward, and\nthat is the fuel for work.\nAnd every once in awhile at\nrandom remove the reward.\nThat's the way to continue\nto stay motivated.\nNot to reward every action or every goal.\nAnd this is also true,\nif you're trying to train up\nchildren or train up players\non a team, you should\nnot celebrate every win.\nI know that's a little counter-intuitive,\nwe're going to go more into\nthe biology of dopamine\nand how it relates to the pleasure system\nlater on in the podcast,\nbut for now understand\nintermittent reward schedules\nharness the biology of dopamine\nin ways that can allow you\nessentially infinite motivation over time.\nBefore I go any further,\nI want to acknowledge that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the sponsors\nof today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany, if not all of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays with the advent of DNA tests,\nyou can get further\nknowledge into the mechanisms\nthat are going on in your body\nand how those mechanisms are changing\nas they relate to metabolism and hormones\nand other aspects that\nprofoundly impact your wellbeing.\nThe problem with most\nblood tests, however,\nis that you get information\nback and it will tell you\nwhether or not your levels\nof something are higher, low,\nor within range, but it doesn't\ngive you any directives.\nIt doesn't tell you what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker has\nthis wonderful feature.\nIt's a very easy to use\ndashboard that has suggestions\nabout lifestyle factors, exercise,\nnutrition, supplementation, et cetera,\nthat one could take in order\nto adjust those numbers\naccording to your personal goals.\nSo the whole thing is made very easy.\nIn fact, they can come to\nyour home to do the blood test\nand DNA test if you like.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code huberman@checkout.\nAnd I should also mention that\nthrough August 15th, 2021,\nyou can get a free inner age test.\nThat's a measure of your biological age\naccording to your DNA and other factors\nwith any purchase from\nInsideTracker store.\nSo go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans and up to up\nand through August 15th, you\ncan get a free inner age test.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are ideally suited\nto your sleep needs.\nEverybody's different.\nSome people sleep on their sides,\nsome people sleep on their stomach,\nsome people sleep on their back,\nsome people run warm during the night,\nsome people run cold.\nIf you go to the Helix's\nwebsite, helixsleep.com,\nyou can take a quick two-minute quiz,\nand then it will tell you\nwhat your ideal mattress is.\nIt will match you to your ideal mattress.\nI did this and I matched to\nthe so-called Dusk mattress.\nI like a mattress that's\nnot too firm nor too soft.\nI tend to run hot during the night\nand I tend to sleep on\nmy side or on my stomach.\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\nabout nine months ago,\nand I'm sleeping better\nthan I ever have before.\nSo if you're interested\nin upgrading your mattress\nto one that's ideally\nsuited to your sleep needs,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two-minutes sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you to\na customized mattress.\nAnd you'll get up to $200\noff that mattress order,\nand two free pillows.\nThey have a 10-year warranty\nand you get to try out\nthe mattress for a 100 nights risk-free,\nthey'll even pick it up for\nyou if you don't love it,\nbut I think you really will love it.\nSo again, if you're interested,\ngo to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off\nand two free pillows.\nToday's episode is also brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an\nall-in-one vitamin\nmineral probiotic drink.\nI started drinking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nAnd so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ndrinking Athletic Greens\nand the reason why I still drink\nit once or even twice a day\nis because it takes care of all\nmy foundational nutritional needs.\nIt includes vitamins,\nminerals, and probiotics\nwhich are important\nfor the gut microbiome,\nthis colony of bacteria,\nhealthy bacteria that we\nall have living in our guts.\nAnd when that bacteria is healthy,\nour brain functions better,\nour immune system functions better.\nThere is now a lot of\nresearch to support that.\nAthletic Greens taste delicious.\nI mix mine with water and a\nlittle bit of lemon juice.\nAnd as I mentioned, I drink\nit once or twice a day,\nusually in the morning and\nagain in the afternoon.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand claim a special offer.\nThat special offer is a\nyear supply of vitamin D3K2.\nThere's now a robust literature\nshowing that vitamin D3\nis critical for various\naspects of our health,\nmetabolic health, endocrine\nhealth, et cetera.\nAnd you'll also get\nfive free travel packs.\nWhen you travel mixing up Athletic Greens\nis made really easy by\nthese little travel packs.\nYou just put them in a jar\nor other a water bottle,\nmix it with water.\nIt's very easy to do on a\nplane or in the et cetera.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto get the Athletic Greens,\nthe five free travel packs\nand the year supply of vitamin D3K2.\nSo let's talk about pleasure and pain.\nI think we all intuitively understand\nwhat pleasure and pain are.\nPleasure generally is\na sensation in the body\nand in the mind that\nleads us to pursue more\nof whatever is bringing\nabout that sensation.\nAnd pain is also a sensation\nin the body and in the mind\nthat in general leads\nus to want to withdraw\nor move away from some\nactivity or interaction.\nThat's not always the case.\nSome people actively seek out pain.\nSome people somehow\ncan't seem to engage with\nor experience pleasure,\nbut most people operate on this\nbasis of pleasure and pain.\nScientists would call\nthis appetitive behaviors,\nmeaning behaviors that lead\nus to create an appetite\nfor more of those behaviors\nand aversive behaviors,\nbehaviors that make us want\nto move away from something.\nThe simplest example of\nthat would be putting your\nhand near a hot flame, at some point,\nthere would be a reflex or a deep desire\nto withdraw your hand.\nTasting something delicious\nin general makes us want\nto eat more of that thing.\nInteractions with other\npeople that we find delicious,\nalso make us want to interact\nwith those people more.\nNone of this is complicated\nor sophisticated.\nThis is simply to illustrate\nthe fact that pleasure and pain\ntend to evoke opposite responses,\nopposite behavioral responses\nand opposite emotional responses.\nSo how does that come about?\nWell, it really comes\nabout by an interaction\nthat starts at one end of\nour body, meaning our skin\nand the other end of\nthe organs of our body,\nwhich is deep within the brain.\nSo let's consider these\ntwo ends of the spectrum\nof pleasure and pain\nand what they contribute\nto those experiences of pleasure and pain.\nThe organ that we call the\nskin, as I mentioned earlier,\nis the largest organ in our body.\nAnd throughout that\norgan, we have neurons,\nlittle nerve cells.\nNow to be really technical about it,\nand the way I'd like you to understand it\nis that the so-called cell\nbody meaning the location\nof a cell in which the\nDNA and other goodies\nthe kind of central factory of the cell,\nthat actually sits right\noutside your spinal cord.\nSo all up and down your\nspinal cord on either side\nare these little blobs of neurons,\nlittle collections of neurons.\nThey have a name if you'd like to know\nfor you aficionado or\nthose who are curious,\nthey're called DRGs dorsal root ganglia.\nA ganglion is just a\ncollection or clump of cells.\nAnd those DRGs are really\ninteresting because they send\none branch that we call an axon,\na little wire out to our\nskin, also to our muscles\ninto our organs, but here\nwe're talking about the skin.\nThey send a wire out to our\nskin and that wire literally\nreaches up into the skin.\nIt's actually in our skin\nand they have another wire\nfrom that same cell body\nthat goes in the opposite direction,\nwhich is up to our brain\nand creates connections\nwithin our brain in the\nso-called brainstem.\nWhat this means is that\nthe neuron in your body\nthat we call the DRG\nthat sends a wire an axon\nto sense what's going on in your big toe\nand then sends another axon\nin the opposite direction\ninto the base of your brain,\nthat is the largest cell in\nyour entire body of any kind.\nFat cell, muscle cell,\nnerve cell, et cetera.\nIs extremely long cells.\nIt can be a meter or more depending\non how tall you happen to be.\nSo we have these cells that have wires\nthey go off in two different directions\nand the wire that's within\nour skin will respond\nto any number of different\ncategories of stimuli.\nThese wires are positioned within the skin\nto respond to mechanical forces.\nSo maybe light touch,\nsome will only send electrical activity up\ntoward the brain in\nresponse to light touch.\nMeaning if you press on\nthe skin really hard,\nthey don't respond.\nYou stroke the skin lightly\nwith your fingertips\nor a feather and they\nrespond very robustly.\nOthers respond to course\npressure, the hard pressure,\nbut they won't respond to a\nlight feather, for instance.\nOthers respond to temperature.\nSo they will respond\nto the presence of heat\nor the presence of cold or\nchanges in heat and cold.\nAnd still others respond\nto other types of stimuli,\nlike certain chemicals on our skin.\nMany of you have probably\nexperienced the sensation\nof eating a hot pepper.\nWell, I don't recommend doing this,\nbut were you to take a\nlittle slice of jalapeno\nor other hot pepper, habanero\npepper or something like that\nand rub it on your skin, you\nwould actually feel something\nat that location.\nAnd that's because that\npepper doesn't just create\na sensation within your mouth,\nit will create a similar\nsensation on your skin.\nSo these neurons are amazing.\nThey're collecting information\nof particular kinds\nfrom the skin throughout the entire body\nand sending that information\nup toward the brain.\nAnd what's really incredible,\nI just want you to\nponder this for a second.\nWhat's really incredible\nis that the language\nthat those neurons use\nis exactly the same.\nThe neuron that responds to light touch\nsends electrical signals\nup toward the brain,\nthe neurons that respond\nto cold or to heat\nor to habanero pepper, they only respond\nto the particular thing that\nevokes the electrical response.\nI should say that they only respond\nto the particular stimulus, the pepper,\nthe cold, the heat, et cetera,\nthat will evoke an electrical signal,\nbut the electrical signals\nare a common language\nthat all neurons use.\nAnd yet, if something cold\nis presented to your skin,\nlike an ice cube, even if\nyou don't see that ice cube,\nif your eyes are closed, or\nsomeone comes up behind you\nand puts an ice cube\nagainst your bare skin back,\nyou know that that sensation,\nthat thing is cold.\nYou don't misperceive it as\nheat or as a habanero pepper.\nSo that's amazing.\nWhat that means is that\nthere must be another element\nin the equation of what\ncreates pleasure or pain.\nAnd that element is your brain.\nYour brain takes these electrical signals\nand interprets them.\nPartially based on experience,\nbut also there are some\ninnate meaning some hard wired\naspects of pain and pleasure sensing\nthat require no experience whatsoever.\nA child doesn't have to fall down but once\nto know on that first fall, that hurt.\nThey don't have to touch a flame,\nbut once and the very first\ntime they will withdraw\ntheir hand from the flame.\nSo no prior experiences required.\nOther things prior experience is required.\nFor instance, if you're somebody that has\nan intense, intense\naversion to spicy foods,\nthat's probably because you've\ntasted spicy foods before.\nLikewise, if you really like sweet foods,\nit's probably because\nyou've tasted them before.\nSo you can start to make predictions\nbased on prior experience,\nbut the pain and pleasure system\ndon't need prior experience.\nWhat they need is a\nbrain that can interpret\nthese electrical signals\nthat can take these electrical\nsignals and somehow create\nwhat we call pleasure\nand pain out of them.\nSo what parts of the brain?\nWell, mainly it's the\nso-called somatosensory cortex.\nThe portion of our neocortex,\nwhich is on the outside of our brain,\nthat kind of bumpy part, not kind of\nif you have a normally formed\nbrain, it will be bumpy.\nIf you have a smooth\nbrain that's not good.\nSome animals just have a smooth brain.\nHumans have a bumpy brain,\nwhich means it has a\nvery large surface area.\nAnd those bumps are 'cause\nyou squeezed it like a pizza\nand clump and you bunched it all up\nand put inside the skull.\nThat's good.\nThat means you have a lot of neurons.\nAnd in your somatosensory cortex,\nyou have a map of your\nentire body surface.\nThat map is called a homunculus.\nAnd if we were to take your cortex\nand lay it out on a table,\nI've actually done this with the cortices\nof various animals and humans included.\nWhat you would find is that\nthere's literally a map\nof your entire body surface.\nBut it wouldn't look exactly like you,\nthis map would be very distorted.\nWhy would it be distorted?\nWell, certain areas of your body\nhave a much denser\ninnervation as we call it,\nor put simply many more\nof these sensory wires\nfrom these DRGs within your skin.\nSo this map of you that\nexists in your brain,\nand you do have one of these\non each side of your brain,\nso you have two of\nthese maps to homunculi,\nthat is you, it's your\nrepresentation of touch\nincluding pleasure and pain.\nAnd in that map, your lips are enormous.\nAnd your back is very, very small.\nAnd the area around your eyes\nand the area representing your\nface is absolutely enormous.\nSo you would look like some\nsort of odd, weird clay doll\nfrom some sort of bizarre\nlate night animation thing.\nAnd just imagine the\npsychedelic experience of that\ncharacter of you and that's\nwhat it would look like.\nBut it's not randomly organized.\nTo the contrary, it's highly organized\nin a very particular way,\nwhich is that the areas of your skin\nthat have the highest density\nof the sensory receptors\nare magnified in your brain.\nSo it's sort of like having more pixels\nin a certain part of a camera than others,\nand in doing that\nallowing higher resolution\nin this case of touch, not a vision,\nbut of touch sensation in\ncertain parts of your body.\nWhat are the areas that are magnified?\nWell, the lips, the face,\nthe tips of the fingers,\nthe feet, and the genitals.\nAnd so this map of you\nhas very large lips, face,\ntips of fingers, bottoms\nof feet, and genitals.\nAnd that's because the innervation,\nthe number of wires that go\ninto those regions of your body\nfar exceeds the number of\nwires for sensation of touch\nthat go to other areas of your body.\nYou can actually experience\nthis in real time right now\nby doing a simple experiment that we call\ntwo-point discrimination.\nTwo-points discrimination is your ability\nto know whether or not\ntwo points of pressure\nare far apart, near each other,\nor you actually could perceive incorrectly\nas one point of pressure.\nYou might want a second\nperson to do this experiment.\nHere's how you would do it.\nYou will close your eyes,\nthat person would take two fine points.\nDon't make them too sharp, please.\nSo it could be two pencils\nor pens or the backs of pens.\nTwo pens I'm holding in my hands.\nIf you're just listening to\nthis, I'm just holding two pens.\nMy favorite pens, these\npilot, V5 or V7, which I love.\nIf you were to close your eyes\nand I were to take these two pens\nand put their points close\ntogether about a centimeter apart\nand present them to the top of your hand,\nI'm going to just going\nto do that now to myself.\nYou, even though your eyes were closed,\nyou would be able to perceive\nthat that was two points\nof pressure presented simultaneously\nto the top of your hand.\nHowever, if I were to do this\nto the middle of your back,\nyou would not experience them\nas two points of pressure.\nYou would experience them as\none single point of pressure.\nIn other words, your two point\ndiscrimination is better,\nis higher on areas of your body\nwhich have many, many\nmore sensory receptors.\nYou are more sensitive at those locations.\nNow this makes perfect\nsense once you experience it\nor you hear about it.\nHowever, most of us\ndon't really appreciate\nhow important and what a\nprofound influence this change\nin density of receptors\nacross our body surface has.\nAnd we can go a step further\nand describe another feature\nof the way that you're built and the way\nthat you experience pleasure and pain,\nwhich is called the dermatome.\nThe dermatome is literally the way\nin which your body surface is carved up\ninto different territories.\nMuch like a map of the\nUnited States is carved up\ninto different territories\nof states and counties, et cetera.\nThe dermatome is the way in which neurons\nconnect to different parts of your body.\nNow, you've actually experienced\nthe dermatome before.\nThe dermatome is when you have a neuron\nthat connects to a\nparticular area of the body\nand that neuron doesn't just\nsend one little wire out\nlike one little line\nand go up into the skin\nto detect mechanical, or\nthermal, or chemical stimuli.\nIt actually sends many\nbranches out like a tree.\nBut remember those\nbranches of the tree come\nfrom one single neuron.\nNow, occasionally what will\nhappen is you will experience\nsomething like cold, or\nheat, or pain, or tingling\non a patch of your body.\nAnd occasionally that patch\nof body will actually have\na very cleanly demarcated boundary,\na very stark boundary\nwith the areas around it.\nA good example of this would\nbe the herpes simplex 1 virus,\nwhich if one has this virus,\nand I should mention that\nsomewhere between 80 and 90%\nof people have this virus,\nthis is not a sexually transmitted virus.\nThis is a virus is transmitted\nvery easily between people\nthrough various forms of\ncontact non-sexual contact,\nit's present in children,\nit's present in adults\nand most people get it, some\nget symptoms and some don't\nsome get recurring symptoms, some don't.\nWe can talk about that\nat the end, if you like,\nbut this virus lives on what's called\nthe fifth cranial nerve also\ncalled the trigeminal nerve.\nThe trigeminal nerve sends\nbranches out to the lips,\nto the eyes, and to certain\nportions of the face.\nSo for those of you listening,\nI've just kind of put my\nright hand across my face\nand to sort of simulate\nthe three branches,\nthe trigeminal aspect of this nerve.\nSo tri three.\nNow, when the herpes virus\nflares up, as they say,\nin response to stress or other factors,\nthe virus inflames that nerve\nand people experience tingling\nand pain on the nerve.\nSometimes they'll get a\ncold sore or a blister\non their lip or near their mouth,\nsometimes they'll get\na collection of those.\nAnd that's because that\ndermatome is actually inflamed.\nNow other people will experience\nsomething like shingles.\nIt's a fairly common viral infection.\nAnd what they'll notice\nis they'll get a rash\nthat has a boundary.\nIt's like, they'll get a bunch of bumps,\nsometimes blisters, and\nit'll have a sharp boundary.\nThat boundary exists because\nthe virus exists on the nerve.\nAnd so it actually is boundaried\nwith the neighboring area of the body\nthat's receiving input from another nerve\nand that one doesn't have\nthe virus living on it.\nSo anytime you see a rash or\na pattern on the body surface\non the skin that has a\npretty stark boundary,\nchances are that's an event\nthat's impacting the dermatome.\nI've experienced this before\nthen not through herpes simplex,\nbut through the experience\nof having a lot of blood\nsort of aggregating in a kind of a segment\nacross the front of my\nface, it was really bizarre.\nI looked in the mirror and I\nthought, what is going on here?\nI was having an allergic\nreaction to something I'd eaten.\nAnd that allergic reaction\nclearly was affecting one\nof the nerves and therefore the dermatome\nand what it showed up was,\nit was almost like someone\nhad drawn lines on my face\nthat said, okay, this rash\nor this reaction rather\ncan happen here, but not in\na region right next to it.\nWhenever you see that chances are\nit's a reaction of the\nnerves of the dermatome.\nSo you'll start to see\nthese things more and more\nwhen you start to look for them.\nYou don't always have to\nhave a viral infection\nto experience this.\nSometimes you'll just experience tingling\nor even a pleasant sensation,\nand it will be restricted\nin kind of a strict boundary\non one location or your body\nsurface and not another.\nNot corresponding to an organ like,\nokay, this arm or just your\nfeet or something like that.\nBut just a segment.\nIt's almost like someone\noutlined a particular area\nof her body surface.\nThat's the dermatome.\nSo you've got sensors in the skin\nand you've got a brain\nthat's going to interpret\nwhat's going on with those sensors.\nIn fact, we can take an\nexample of a sudden rash\nor inflammation at one\nlocation, the dermatome,\nand we can ask what would make it hurt?\nWhat would make it worse?\nWhat would make it go away?\nAnd believe it or not, your\nsubjective interpretation\nof what's happening has\na profound influence\non your experience of pleasure or pain.\nThere are several things that\ncan impact these experiences,\nbut the main categories are expectation.\nSo sort of whether or not\nyou thought or could expect\nthat this thing was\ngoing to happen, right?\nIf someone tells you\nthis is going to hurt,\nI'm going to give you\nan injection right here,\nit might hurt for a second.\nThat's very different and\nyour experience of that pain\nwill be very different than\nif it happened suddenly\nout of the blue.\nThere's also anxiety, how anxious,\nor how high or low your level\nof arousal, autonomic arousal,\nthat's going to impact your\nexperience of pleasure or pain.\nHow well you slept and where you are\nin the so-called circadian\nor 24-hour cycle.\nOur ability to tolerate\npain changes dramatically\nacross the 24-hour cycle.\nAnd as you can imagine is\nduring the daylight waking hours\nthat we are better able to tolerate,\nwe are more resilient to pain,\nand we are better able\nto experience pleasure.\nAt night our threshold\nfor pain is much lower.\nIn other words, the amount of mechanical\nor chemical or thermal\nmeaning temperature stimulated\nthat can evoke a pain response\nand how we rate that response\nis much lower at night.\nAnd in particular, in the hours\nbetween 2:00 AM and 5:00 AM,\nif you're on a kind of\nstandard circadian schedule.\nAnd then the last one is our genes.\nPain threshold and how\nlong a pain response lasts\nis in part dictated by our genes.\nAnd later I'm going to discuss this myth\nor whether or not it's really a myth\nas to whether or not certain\npeople in particular red heads,\npeople who have reg\npigmented hair and fair skin,\nwhether or not their\npain thresholds differ.\nAnd to just give you a\nlittle sneak peek into that,\nindeed they do and it's\nbecause of a genetic difference\nin a particular gene, in a\nparticular pattern of receptors\nin the skin that are\nrelated to the pigmentation\nof hair and skin.\nSo we have expectation,\nanxiety, how well we've slept,\nwhere we are in the so-called\n24-hour circadian time\nand our genes.\nSo let's talk about\nexpectation and anxiety\nbecause those two factors\ncan powerfully modulate\nour experience of both pleasure and pain\nin ways that will allow us to\ndial up pleasure if we like\nand to dial down pain, if indeed\nthat's what we want to do.\nSo let's talk about\nexpectation and anxiety\nbecause those two things\nare somewhat tethered.\nThere are now a number\nof solid experiments,\nboth in animal models and in humans\nthat point to the fact that\nif we know a painful stimulus\nis coming, that we can better\nprepare for it mentally\nand therefore buffer or\nreduce the pain response.\nHowever, the timing in which\nthat anticipation occurs\nis vital for this to happen.\nAnd if that timing isn't quite right,\nit actually can make the\nexperience of pain far worse.\nSo here I'm summarizing a\nlarge amount of literature,\nbut essentially if subjects are warned\nthat a painful stimulus is coming,\ntheir subjective experience of\nthat pain is vastly reduced.\nHowever, if they are\nwarned just two seconds\nbefore that pain arrives,\nit does not help.\nIt actually makes it worse.\nAnd the reason is they\ncan't do anything mentally\nto prepare for it in that\nbrief two second window.\nSimilarly, if they are warned\nabout pain that's coming\ntwo minutes before a\npainful stimulus is coming\nelectric shock or a poke or\ncold stimulus or heat stimulus\nthat's pretty extreme,\nthat also makes it worse\nbecause their expectation\nramps up the autonomic arousal.\nThe level of alertness\nis all funneled toward\nthat negative experience that's coming.\nSo how soon before a painful stimulus\nshould we know about it if the goal is\nto reduce our level of pain?\nAnd the answer is somewhere\nbetween 20 seconds\nand 40 seconds is about right.\nNow, I'm averaging across a\nnumber of different studies,\nbut if you have about\n20 seconds or 40 seconds\nadvance warning that\nsomething bad is coming,\nyou can prepare yourself for that,\nbut the preparation itself and the arousal\nthat comes with it,\nthe kind of leaning in,\nokay, I'm either going to relax myself\nor I'm going to really\nkind of dig my heels in\nand kind of meet the pain head on.\nThat seems to be the optimal window.\nThis can come and useful\nin a variety of contexts,\nbut I think it's important\nbecause what it illustrates\nis that it absolutely cannot\nbe just the pattern of signals\nthat are arriving from\nthe skin, from these DRGs,\nthese neurons that connect to skin\nthat dictates our experience\nof pain or pleasure.\nThere has to be a subjective\ninterpretation component,\nand indeed that's the case.\nSo let's talk about the\nrange of pain experiences.\nAnd from that, we will understand better\nwhat the range of pleasure experiences are\nthat different people have\nbecause we are all different\nin terms of our pain threshold.\nFirst of all, what is pain threshold?\nPain threshold has two dimensions.\nThe first dimension is the\namount of mechanical or chemical\nor thermal stimulation\nthat it takes for you or me\nor somebody else to say,\nI can't take that anymore.\nI'm done.\nBut there's another element as well\nwhich is how long the pain persists.\nI'll just describe myself for example,\nI don't consider myself somebody\nwho has a particularly\nhigh pain threshold.\nI don't think it's\nparticularly low either,\nbut I wouldn't consider myself somebody\nthat has a particularly\nhigh pain threshold.\nWhen I stubbed my toe against\nthe corner of the bed,\nit absolutely hurts.\nBut one thing that I've noticed is\nthat I have very sharp\ninflections, very high inflections\nin my perception of pain, and\nthen they go away quickly.\nI don't know if that's adaptive or not.\nIt's probably not,\nbut my experience of pain is\nvery intense, but very brief.\nOther people experience pain in a much\nkind of slower rising,\nbut longer-lasting manner.\nAnd to just really point\nout how varied we all are\nin terms of our experience of pain,\nlet's look to an experiment.\nThere been experiments done\nat Stanford School of Medicine\nand elsewhere, which\ninvolved having subjects\nput their hand into a\nvery cold vat of water\nand measuring the amount of time\nthat they kept their hand in that water.\nAnd then they would tell the\nexperimenter very quietly,\nhow painful that particular stimulus was\non a scale of one to 10\nso-called Likert scale\nfor your aficionados.\nThat simple experiment\nrevealed that people experience\nthe same thermal in this\ncase, cold stimulus,\nvastly different.\nSome people would rate it as\na 10 out of 10 extreme pain.\nOther people would rate it\nas barely painful at all,\nlike a one.\nOther people, a three other\npeople, a five, et cetera.\nNow what's interesting is\nthat the same thing is true\nfor experience of a hot, painful stimulus\n120 degree hot plate, where you\nhave to put your hand on it,\nand then at some point\nyou remove your hand.\nSome people are able to keep their hand\non there the whole time, but\npeople rate that experience\nas very painful, a little bit painful\nor moderately painful\ndepending on who they are.\nNow, that's interesting,\nprobably not that surprising, however,\nbut what is very interesting is that\nwhen the same experiment\nwas done on medical doctors\nor medical doctors in training,\nthey too of course experienced pain\nthrough a range of subjective experiences.\nSome of them just like any\nother person off the street\nsaid a particular stimulus\nof a particular temperature\nwas very painful, other said\nit wasn't painful at all\nand some said it was moderately painful.\nAnd that turns out to be vitally important\nfor the treatment of pain\nbecause pain is not an event in the skin.\nPain is a subjective,\nemotional experience.\nYou may have heard that we\nhave a particular category\nof these DRGs that innervate the skin,\nwhich are called nociceptors.\nNociceptor comes from the word\nnoci, nocere I believe it is,\nwhich means to harm.\nHowever, nociceptors don't\ncarry information about pain,\nthey carry information about\nparticular types of stimuli\nimpacting the skin.\nAnd then the brain assigns\na value of valence to it,\na label and says that's painful.\nAnd where people draw the\nline between not painful\nand painful varies.\nNow, because physicians are people\nand because physicians treat pain,\nwhat we know from a lot of data\nnow is that if someone comes\ninto the clinic and says they're\nexperiencing chronic pain\nor whole body pain or\nacute pain after an injury\nor one location, it doesn't\nreally matter what the cause is\nor even if there's a cause at all,\nhow the doctor reacts to that\nreport of the patient's pain\nwill dictate in many cases\nthe course of treatment.\nAnd of course doctors, their\ngoal is to treat the patient\nto going to the patient's\nneeds, not their own.\nAnd that's what good doctors do.\nHowever, it's been found and\nI think now there is work\nbeing done to try and change this,\nbut if a doctor has a very\nhigh threshold for pain,\ntheir interpretation of\nsomebody else's report of pain\nis going to be different.\nThey might not discount\nthe patient, right?\nThis doesn't necessarily\nmean that they think, oh,\nthis person their pain is\nirrelevant, probably not.\nIn fact, from having a\nhigh threshold for pain,\nif someone comes in and\nsays, I'm in extreme pain,\nthat doctor probably thinks,\nwow, this has to be\nreally, really extreme,\nbut they can be talking about\ntwo different experiences.\nSimilarly, if a physician has\na very low threshold for pain,\nand someone comes in and says,\nyeah, I'm experiencing\nsome pain in my back.\nI've got the sciatica thing, but yeah,\nit's a little bit uncomfortable.\nIt's like a, I don't know\nlike a four out of 10.\nWell, that physician might\ninterpret that four out of 10\nas a pretty extreme sense of pain\nor pretty extreme experience of pain.\nAnd so you can start to see\nhow the subjective nature\nof pain can start to have real impact\non the treatment of pain\nbecause treatment of pain\nis carried out by physicians.\nIn fact, there is no\nobjective measure of pain.\nWe can ask how long\nsomebody can keep their hand\non a hot plate or in a cold bath.\nYou can do various experiments.\nThey even have some extreme experiments\nwhere they'll shave a portion of the leg\nand they'll put on a very\npainful chemical compound\nand see how long people can tolerate that.\nThese are very uncomfortable\nexperiments as you can imagine,\nbut in general, we don't have a way\nof measuring somebody else's\nsubjective experience of pain.\nThere is no blood pressure measure.\nThere's no heart rate beats\nper minute measure of pain.\nSo one of the great\nefforts of neuroscience\nand of medicine is to try and come up\nwith more objective measures of pain.\nSimilarly, pleasure is something\nthat we all talk about.\nOoh, that feels so good, or I love that\nor more of that please or less of that,\nbut we have no way of\ngauging what other people\nare experiencing except what\nthey report through language.\nAnd so this is really just to illustrate\nthat this whole thing around\npain isn't a black box.\nWe do have an understanding\nof the elements.\nThere are elements in the skin,\nthere's elements of the brain,\nthere's expectation,\nanxiety, sleep, and genes,\nbut that it is very complicated.\nAnd yet there are certain principles\nthat fall out of that complicated picture\nthat can allow us to better\nunderstand and navigate\nthis axis that we call\nthe pleasure-pain axis.\nSo rather than focus on just\nthe subjective nature of pain,\nlet's talk about the\nabsolute qualities of pain\nand the absolute qualities of pleasure\nso that we can learn how to\nnavigate those two experiences\nin ways that serve us each better.\nFirst of all, I want to\ntalk about heat and cold.\nWe do indeed have sensors in our skin\nthat respond to heat and cold.\nAnd for any of you that\nhave entered a cold shower\nor a cold body of water of any\nkind or ice bath, et cetera,\nyou will realize that getting\ninto cold is much harder\nif you do it slowly.\nNow, despite that people\ntend to do it very slowly.\nI have noticed an enormous\nvariation with which people\ncan embrace the experience of cold.\nI noticed it because I do\nsome work with athletes\nand I do some work with military\nand I do some work with\nthe general public.\nAnd one of the best tests of\nhow somebody can handle pain\nis to ask them to just\nget into an ice bath.\nIt's not a very sophisticated experience,\nbut it really gets into the\ncore of the kind of circuitry\nthat we're talking about, both\nin the skin and in the brain.\nSome people regardless of\nsex, regardless of age,\nand regardless of physical ability\ncan just get into the cold.\nThey're somehow able to do it.\nNow, I don't know what their\nexperience of the cold is.\nAnd neither do you.\nYou only know your experience,\nbut they're able to do that.\nSome do it quickly, some do it slowly.\nOthers find the experience\nof cold to be so aversive\nthat they somehow cannot\nget themselves in.\nThey start quaking, they start complaining\nand many of them just simply get out.\nThey can't do it.\nSome don't even get in past their knees.\nThis isn't necessarily\nabout pain threshold,\nbut it's related to that.\nI think it can be helpful\nto everyone to know\nthat even though it feels\nbetter at a mental level\nto get into the cold\nslowly and people ask, oh,\nI just want to get in slowly,\nI want to take my time.\nIt is actually much worse\nfrom a neuro-biological perspective.\nThe neurons that sense cold respond\nto what are called relative\ndrops in temperature.\nSo it's not about the absolute\ntemperature of the water.\nIt's about the relative\nchange in temperature.\nSo as you move from a\nparticular temperature,\nwhether or not it's in the\nair next to an ice bath\nor cold shower, or from a\nbody of water that's warm\nto a body of water that's colder,\nor sometimes in the ocean,\nyou'll notice it's warm.\nAnd then as you swim out further,\nyou'll get into a pocket of\nwater where it's much colder.\nThat's when the cold receptors\nin your skin start firing\nand sending signals up to your brain.\nTherefore, you can bypass\nthese signals going up\nto the brain with each relative\nchange one degree change,\ntwo degrees change, et cetera,\nby simply getting in all at once.\nIn fact it is true and maybe\nyou've been told this before,\nand it is true that if\nyou get into cold water\nup to your neck,\nit's actually much more comfortable\nthan if you're halfway in and halfway out.\nAnd that's because of the\ndifference in the signals\nthat are being sent\nfrom the cold receptors\non your upper torso,\nwhich is out of the water\nin your lower torso.\nNow, I wouldn't want anyone to take this\nto mean that they should just jump\ninto an unknown body of water.\nThere are all sorts of\nfactors like currents,\nand if it's very, very cold, yes, indeed.\nYou can stop the heart.\nPeople can have heart attacks from getting\ninto extremely cold water,\nlike a melted mountain stream\nthat's been frozen all winter,\nor has been very, very cold or\nas a snow pack going into it.\nIf very cold, you can\nindeed have a heart attack.\nSo please be smart about\nhow cold and what bodies\nof cold water you happen\nto put yourself into.\nBut it is absolutely true\nthat provided it safe,\ngetting into a cold water\nis always going to be easier\nto do quickly and is going to be easier\nto do up to your neck.\nIn fact, you actually want to\nget your shoulders submerged.\nThere are a number of\nother things you can do\nif you really want and it's safe to do.\nYou can put your face under and activate\nthe so-called dive reflex,\nwhich also makes the tolerance\nof cold easier believe it or not.\nSo it's very counterintuitive.\nIt's like getting into water\nfaster and more completely\nyou will experience as less\nuncomfortable, less cold.\nAnd indeed that's the case.\nAnd that's because these cold receptors\nare measuring every relative\ndrop in temperature.\nSo every single one is\ngraded as we say in biology,\nit's not absolute.\nAs an additional point, if\nyou're sitting in a body\nof cold water and it's not circulating,\nyou'll notice that you start\nto warm up a little bit.\nOr even if you feel like\nyou're freezing cold,\nif you move and that water\naround you moves, of course,\nthen you'll notice it's got even colder.\nAnd that's because\nthere's a thermal layer.\nYou're actually heating up the water\nthat surrounds your body\nlike a halo around every\naspect of your body.\nA sort of silhouette of you of heat\nwhere you're heating that water.\nWhen you move, you disrupt\nthat thermal layer.\nNow heat is the opposite.\nHeat and the heat receptors in your skin\nrespond to absolute\nchanges in temperature.\nAnd this is probably because our body\nand our brain can tolerate\ndrops in temperature\nmuch better than it can tolerate\nincreases in temperature safely.\nSo when you move from say a\nstandard outdoor environment,\nI mean, here in the States\nwe measure in terms of Fahrenheit.\nSo maybe it's a 75 or an 80\ndegree, or even 90 degree day,\nand you get into a 100 degrees sauna,\nor if you're in a cool\nair conditioned building\nand you go outside and\nit's very warm outside,\nyou sort of feel like the heat\nhits you all at once, boom.\nHits you all at once, kind\nof like a slap in the face,\nbut then it will just stay at that level.\nYour body will acclimate to\nthat particular temperature.\nHowever, if that temperature\nis very, very high,\nyou'll notice that your\nexperience of that heat\nand your experience of\nkind of pain and discomfort\nand your desire to get out of that heat\nwill tend to persist.\nYou don't really adapt in the same way.\nAnd certain people who are really good\nat handling very hot\nsauna, get better at this.\nYou learned to calm your\nbreathing, et cetera,\nlower your autonomic arousal.\nObviously you don't want to\nlet your body temperature\ngo too high because\nneurons cook, they die.\nIf neurons die, they don't\ncome back and that's bad.\nMany people unfortunately harm\nthemselves with hyperthermia.\nEveryone has a different threshold\nfor this, but in general,\nyou don't want your body\ntemperature to go up too high.\nThat's why a fever of like 103 starts\nto become worrisome 104.\nYou really get concerned if and it goes\nup into that range or higher,\nthat's when you need to\nreally cool down the body\nor get to hospital so\nthey can cool you down.\nHeat is measured in absolute\nterms by the neurons.\nSo gradually moving into heat makes sense,\nand finding that threshold,\nwhich is safe and comfortable for you,\nor if it's uncomfortable,\nat least resides within\nthat realm of safety.\nSo that's heat and cold,\nand those are sort of non-negotiables.\nYou can try and lower\nyour level of arousal.\nIn fact, many people who\nget into a cold shower\nand ice bath I think the recommendation\nthat I always give is that\nyou have two possible approaches to that.\nYou can either try and relax yourself,\nkind of just stay calm within the cold,\nor you can lean into it.\nYou can actually take mental steps\nto generate more adrenaline\nto kind of meet the demands of that cold.\nAnd at some point we'll\ndo a whole episode on\nhow to use cold and heat\nto certain advantages\nwe've done a little bit\nof this in past episodes\nusing the cold to\nsupercharge human performance\nand things of that sort.\nBut in general, cold is\nmeasured in relative terms.\nAnd therefore getting in all\nat once is a good idea provided\nyou can do it safely.\nAnd heat is measured in absolute levels\nby your brain and body and therefore\nyou want to actually\nmove into it gradually.\nSo it's the kind of the inverse\nof what you might think.\nOne of the most important\nthings to understand\nabout the experience of pain\nand to really illustrate\njust how subjective pain really is,\nis that our experience of\npain and the degree of damage\nto our body are not always correlated.\nAnd in fact, sometimes can\nbe in opposite directions.\nA good example of this would be x-rays.\nWe all occasionally get\nx-rays at least in the US\nwe get x-rays when we go to\nthe dentist from time to time,\nand the occasional x-ray might be safe\ndepending on who you are\nprovide you're not pregnant, et cetera.\nI've gone to the dentist.\nThey put you in the chair,\nthey cover you with the lead blanket,\nand then they run behind the\nscreen to protect themselves.\nAnd they beam me with the\nx-rays to get a picture\nof your teeth and your jaws\nand your skull, et cetera.\nWell, if you were to get too many x-rays,\nyou could severely damage\nthe tissues of your body,\nbut you don't experience any\npain during the x-ray itself.\nIn contrast, you can think\nthat your body is damaged\nand experienced extreme pain\nand yet your body can have no damage.\nA classic example of this was published\nin the British Journal of Medicine,\nin which a construction worker fell from\nI think it was a second\nstory, which he was working\nand a nail went up and through his boot\nand he looked down and\nhe saw the nail going\nthrough his boot and he was\nin absolute excruciating pain.\nThey took him to the hospital\nand because the nail was\nso long and because of\nwhere it had entered,\nit exited the boot, they\nhad to cut away the boot\nin order to get to the nail.\nAnd when they did that,\nthey revealed that the nail had passed\nbetween two of his toes.\nIt had actually failed to\nimpale his body in any way.\nAnd yet the view, the\nperception of that nail\nentering his boot at one\nend and exiting the boot\nat the other was sufficient\nto create the experience\nof a nail that had gone through his foot.\nAnd the moment he realized\nthat that nail had not gone\nthrough his foot, the pain\ncompletely evaporated.\nAnd this has been\ndemonstrated numerous times.\nPeople that work in emergency rooms\nactually see variations on this.\nNot always that extreme,\nbut many times what we see\nand how we perceive that wound\nor that event has a profound influence\non how we experience pain.\nAnd I mentioned this,\nnot just because it's a\nkind of sensational and fantastic example\nof this extreme,\nsubjective nature of pain,\nbut also because it brings\nus back to this element\nwhich is, we don't know\nhow other people feel.\nNot just about pain, but about pleasure.\nWe think we do, we have some general sense\nof whether or not an event ought\nto be painful or pleasurable,\nbut actually we barely\nunderstand how we feel\nlet alone how other people feel,\nand we can be badly\nwrong about how we feel\nmeaning we can misinterpret\nour own sense of pain\nor our own sense of pleasure\ndepending on what we see\nwith our eyes and what\nwe hear with our ears.\nSo we hear a scream like a shrill scream,\nand we think it must be pain.\nAnd if we look at something\nthat's happening to somebody\nand it fits a prior category\nor a prior representation\nof what we would consider\npainful stimulus,\nwell, then we think that\nthey're an extreme pain,\nbut actually they might\nnot be in pain at all.\nNow this highly subjective nature of pain\nand the way in which we\nuse our visual system\nto interpret other people's\npain and our own pain\nhas actually been leveraged\nto treat a very extreme form\nof chronic pain.\nAnd it's an absolutely fascinating area\nof biology and neuroscience.\nAnd it's one that we can\nactually all leverage\ntoward reducing our own levels of pain\nwhenever we are injured.\nOr believe it or not,\neven in chronic pain.\nTo describe this area of science requires\na kind of extreme example,\nbut I want to be clear that\neven if you don't suffer\nfrom this extreme example,\nthere's relevance and a\ntool to extract for you.\nThe extreme example is\nthat of an amputated digit,\nmeaning one of your fingers or your toes,\nor of an amputated limb.\nSo people that have digits or\nlimbs that are gone missing\nfrom an injury or surgical removal,\nwill often have the experience\nthat it's still there.\nThe so-called phantom limb phenomenon.\nNow, why would that be?\nWell, when you remove a\nparticular finger or limb,\nobviously that finger and limb is gone\nand the dorsal root ganglion neuron\nthat would normally send a wire out\nto that particular region of the body,\nthat wire is no longer\nthere because that portion\nof the body is no longer there.\nAnd in some cases, those neurons die\nalmost always, but not always.\nHowever, the map your\nso-called homunculus,\nyour representation of yourself\nin the brain is still there.\nAnd this map, the so-called homunculus map\nthat you have in that\nI have is very plastic.\nIt can change.\nAnd so as a consequence areas of the map\nthat adjacent to one another\ncan actually start to invade\nother areas of the map.\nSo for instance, there\nare neuroimaging studies\nthat have documented that somebody\nthat has say a complete\nremoval of their left arm,\nthe representation of\ntheir left arm still exists\nin the cortex.\nAnd experimentally if one is to stimulate\nthat area of the cortex, that person,\nand if that person were you,\nwould experience having that arm\nthat it were being stimulated,\neven though it's not there.\nNow, someone who has an\namputated arm doesn't need\nto have their brain stimulated\nin order to have the experience\nof that phantom limb being present.\nIn fact, many people who have\nlimbs that were amputated\nfeel as if that limb is still present\neven though obviously it's not.\nAnd no matter how many\ntimes they look to the stump\nand just see a stump,\nsomehow it doesn't reorganize\nthat homunculus so-called\ncentral brain map.\nNow, that would be fine.\nYou might even think that would be better,\nbetter to think you have the arm there\nthan to feel as if it's missing,\nand yet many people who\nhave amputated limbs\nreport phantom limb pain.\nThey don't feel that the arm\nis just casually draped next to them.\nThey feel as if it's bunched\nup and it's an extreme pain.\nIn fact, this kind of contorted stance\nthat I'm taking right here in my chair\nis not unlike the way that\nthese patients described this.\nThey feel as if it's kind of cramped up,\nit's very uncomfortable for them.\nNow, and absolutely creative\nand you could even say genius scientists\nby the name of Ramachandra.\nThat's actually his last name,\nhis complete name is a\nlittle bit more complicated.\nSo you all almost always hear\nRamachandran referred to as\nRamachandran or V.S Ramachandran\nbecause his full name\nis Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran.\nSo a lot of letters in\nthere, a lot of vowels,\nbut Ramachandran is a neuroscientist.\nHe was actually a colleague of mine\nwhen my lab was formerly\nat the University of\nCalifornia, San Diego.\nHas done a lot of work on\nthis phantom limb phenomenon.\nAnd Ramachandra actually started\noff as a vision scientist.\nAnd he understood the\npower of the visual system\nin dictating our experience\nof things like pain and pleasure.\nAnd so what he developed\nwas a very low technology\nyet neuroscientifically\nsophisticated treatment\nfor phantom limb.\nIt consisted of a box, literally a box\nthat had mirrors inside of it.\nAnd the patient would put\nthe intact hand or limb\ninto one side,\nand obviously they couldn't\nput the amputated limb\ninto the other side, but\nbecause of the configuration\nof the mirrors, it\nappeared as though they had\ntwo symmetric limbs inside the box.\nAnd then he would have\nthem look at that limb\nand move it around.\nAnd as they would do this,\nthey would report real time movement,\nor I should say real time\nperception of movement\nin the phantom limb.\nNow this is absolutely\nincredible but makes total sense\nwhen you think about\nthe so-called top down\nor contextual modulation\nof our sensory experience,\nremember it's anticipation, it's anxiety,\nit's interpretation of what's happening\nthat drives our perception\nof what's happening.\nAnd so, as he would have these patients\nmove their intact limb to\na more relaxed position,\nthe patients would feel\nas if the phantom limb were relaxing.\nAnd this was used successfully\nto treat phantom limb pain\nin a number of different people.\nIt didn't always work.\nAnd you can imagine sometimes\nit might be a little\ntrickier like for a leg\nalthough there have been leg\nboxes that have been developed\nand arranged for this purpose.\nAnd what was remarkable\nis that they could finish\nthese experiments and have\nthe patient, the person\nenter a state of relaxation,\nreduced the pain in the phantom limb,\nand it would stay there\neven though, of course,\nas they exited the mirror box,\nthey would go about their\nlife and use their intact limb\nfor its various purposes.\nI love this experiment\nbecause it really speaks\nto the subjective nature\nof pain and pleasure.\nIt speaks to the power\nof the visual system,\nlike what we see just like the nail\nthrough the boot experiment.\nWhat we see profoundly\nimpacts our experience\nof pleasure and pain in this case pain.\nNow, there's another aspect\nto the phantom limb experience\nand of these maps, the\nso-called homunculus maps\nin the cortex that Ramachandran worked on,\nwhich has very interesting\nand reveals the degree\nto which these maps are\nplastic or can change\nin response to experience.\nTurns out that because of the locations\nof different body part\nrepresentations within these maps,\ncertain parts of our body that\nnormally we don't think of\nas related can start to\ncreate merged experiences.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, Ramchandran described a patient\nwho had a somewhat odd experience\nof having lost their foot.\nSo they actually had their foot amputated\nabout midway up the Achilles.\nSo lower portion of the calf and foot.\nI don't recall what the reason\nwas for having it removed.\nAnd fortunately for this patient,\nthey did not experience pain\nin that portion of their body,\nbut rather they confided in him\nthat whenever they would have sex,\nthey would experience their\norgasm in their phantom foot\nin addition to in their\ngenitals, of course.\nAnd Ramachandra understood\nthe homunculus map.\nAnd he understood that this\nwas because the representation\nof the foot within the homunculus\nactually lies adjacent to,\nand is somewhat interdigitated with\nit actually kind of merges\nwith the representation\nof the genitalia.\nNow that's a weird situation.\nAnd yet you now know that\nthe density of innovation\nof the feet and the genitalia,\nas well as the lips and\nthe face are actually\nthe highest sensory innervation\nthat you have in your entire body.\nAnd this speaks to, I think,\na more important general\nprinciple for all people\nof the experience of pleasure or pain,\nwhich is that an aspect\nof our pain or pleasure\ncan be highly localized.\nIt can be because of a cut\nto a particular location\non the body or it can\nbecause of a fall injury\nor a kind of bruise on\none side of our body.\nAnd yet our experience\nof pleasure and pain\ncan also be an almost\na body-wide experience.\nAnd yet it's always most rich.\nIt's always most heightened\nin these regions of our body\nthat have dense sensory innervation.\nSo we experience pain\nand pleasure according\nto local phenomenon receptors in the skin,\nand this homunculus map\nthat has all these different territories,\nbut because of the way that\nthose territories are related,\nthis kind of wild example of\nsomebody experiencing orgasm\nin their phantom foot speaks\nto the larger experience.\nThe more typical rather\nexperience that I should say\nthat all people have,\nwhich is that pleasure can be body-wide\nor we can experience it in our face\nor the bottoms of our feet\nand other areas of the body\nthat we experience pleasure\nand similarly with pain.\nAnd that brings us to the\ntopic of whole body pain,\nnot just localized pain, as\nwell as whole body pleasure\nnot just localized pleasure.\nThere are a number of\nexamples of whole body pain\nthat people suffer from.\nAnd one common one is called fibromyalgia.\nI want to just first share\nwith you a little bit\nof medical insight.\nA few months back, I did an Instagram live\nwith Dr. Sean Mackey\nwho's an MD medical doctor\nand a PhD at Stanford School of Medicine\nthat was recorded and\nplaced on my Instagram.\nIf you want to check it out,\nwe can provide a link to\nthat in the show notes.\nDr. Mackey is the Chief\nof the Division of Pain\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nSo he's a scientist.\nHe studies pain and he\ntreats patients dealing\nwith various forms of\npain, whole body pain,\nlike fibromyalgia, acute pain, et cetera.\nAnd he shared with me\nsomething very interesting,\nwhich is that anytime you\nhear or see the word syndrome,\nthat means the medical\nestablishment does not understand\nwhat's going on.\nA syndrome is a constellation of symptoms\nthat point in a particular direction\nor some general set of directions about\nwhat could be going on,\nbut it doesn't reveal a true\nunderlying disease necessarily.\nIt could be aggregative diseases\nor it could be something else entirely.\nAnd I want to make sure that I emphasize\nthe so-called psychosomatic phenomenon.\nI think sometimes we hear psychosomatic\nand we interpret that as\nmeaning all in one's head.\nBut I think it's important to remember\nthat everything is neural,\nwhether that's pain in your body\n'cause you have a gaping wound\nand you're hemorrhaging out of that wound\nor whether or not it's pain\nfor which you cannot explain it\non the basis of any kind of injury.\nIt's all neural.\nSo saying body, brain, or psychosomatic\nit's kind of irrelevant.\nAnd I hope someday we\nmove past that language.\nPsychosomatic is interesting.\nThere was a paper that\nwas published in 2015,\nand then again in 2020 a different paper\nfocused on the so-called\npsychogenic fevers\nor psychosomatic effects.\nI just briefly want to mention this\nbecause it relates back to pain.\nThese studies have shown\nthat there are areas\nof the so-called thalamus,\nwhich integrates and\nfilter sensory information\nof different kinds.\nAnd within the brainstem,\nan area called the DMH\nand I can also provide a link\nto this study if you like,\nthat shows that there is\na true neurological basis.\nThere are brain areas and\ncircuits that are related to\nwhat's called psychogenic\nfever when we are stressed.\nAnd in particular, if we\nthink that we were injured\nor that we were infected by something,\nwe can actually generate a true fever.\nIt is not an imagined fever.\nIt is our thinking generating\nan increase in body temperature.\nAnd so this has been called psychosomatic.\nIt's been called psychogenic,\nbut it has a neural basis.\nSo when we hear syndrome and\na patient comes into a clinic\nand says that they suffer for instance,\nfrom something which is\nvery controversial frankly\nlike chronic fatigue syndrome,\nsome physicians believe that it reflects\na real underlying medical\ncondition, others don't.\nHowever, syndrome means\nwe don't understand.\nAnd that doesn't mean\nsomething doesn't exist.\nFibromyalgia or whole\nbody pain for a long time\nwas written off or kind of explained away\nby physicians and scientists\nfrankly, my community\nas one of these syndromes.\nIt couldn't be explained.\nHowever, now there is\nwhat I would consider\nand I think others would\nand should consider\nfrom understanding of at\nleast one of the bases\nfor this whole body pain.\nAnd that's activation of\na particular cell type\ncalled glial.\nAnd there's a receptor on these glial\nfor those of you that want to\nknow called the toll 4 receptor\nand activation of the\ntoll 4 receptor is related\nto certain forms of whole\nbody pain and fibromyalgia.\nNow, what treatments\nexist for fibromyalgia.\nAnd even if you don't\nsuffer from fibromyalgia,\nand even if you don't know anyone who does\nthis is important information\nbecause what I'm about to tell you relate\nto how you and your body,\nwhich is you of course\ncan deal with pain of any kind.\nAnd there are actually things\nthat one can do and take\nthat can encourage\nnerve health in general.\nIn other conditions like\ndiabetic neuropathy,\nbut in all individuals.\nSo there are clinical data\nusing a prescription drug.\nThis is work that actually was done\nby Dr. Mackey and colleagues.\nThe drug is called naltrexone.\nNaltrexone is actually\nused for the treatment\nof various opioid addictions\nand things of that sort,\nbut it turns out that a very low dose,\nI believe it was a one 10th\nthe size of the typical dose\nof naltrexone has been\nshown to have some success\nin dealing with and treating\ncertain forms of fibromyalgia.\nAnd it has that success\nbecause of its ability\nto bind to and block these\ntoll four receptors on glial.\nSo this so-called syndrome\nor this thing that previously\nwas called a syndrome, fibromyalgia\nactually has a biological basis.\nIt was not just inpatients heads.\nAnd I really tip my hat to\nthe medical establishment\nincluding Dr. Mackey and others\nwho explored the potential\nunderlying biologies\nof things like fibromyalgia\nand are starting\nto arrive at treatments.\nNow, I'm not a physician, I'm a professor,\nso I'm not prescribing anything.\nYou should talk to your doctor of course,\nif you have fibromyalgia\nor other forms of chronic\nor whole body pain to explore\nwhether or not these low dose\nnaltrexone treatments are right for you.\nBut I think it's a beautiful\ncase study if you will,\nnot a case study of an individual patient,\nbut a case in study of linking\nup the patient's self-report\nof these experiences and using science\nto try to establish clinical treatments.\nThere's another treatment,\nor I should say there's another approach\nthat one could take.\nAnd again, I'm not recommending\npeople do this necessarily.\nYou have to determine what's\nright and say for you,\nI cannot do that.\nThere's no way your\nsituation's very far too much,\nand it would be outside of my wheelhouse\nto prescribe anything, but\nthere's a particular compound\nwhich in the United States\nis sold over the counter\nand in Europe is prescription.\nIt's one that I've talked\nabout on this podcast before\nfor other purposes.\nAnd that compound is acetylcarnitine.\nAcetylcarnitine as I\nmentioned is by prescription\nin most countries in Europe\nand the US you can buy\nthis over the counter.\nThere is evidence that\nacetylcarnitine can reduce\nthe symptoms of chronic whole body pain\nand other certain forms of acute pain\nat dosages of somewhere\nbetween one to three\nand sometimes four grams per day.\nNow acetylcarnitine can be taken orally.\nIt's found in 500 milligram capsules,\nas well as by injection.\nBy injection in the States\nin the United States that is\nalso requires a prescription\nor requires a prescription I should say.\nThe over-the-counter forms\nare generally capsules\nor powders.\nThose apparently do not\nrequire a prescription.\nThere are several studies\nexploring acetylcarnitine\nin this context, as well\nas for diabetic neuropathy.\nAnd what's interesting about\nacetylcarnitine is it's one\nof the few compounds that isn't just used\nfor the treatment of pain,\nbut has also been shown\nin certain contacts\nto improve peripheral\nnerve health generally.\nAnd for that reason, it's\nan interesting compound.\nI've also talked about\nacetylcarnitine on here previously,\nbecause it has robust effects\non things like spur motility\nand health, including the\nspeeds at which sperms swim,\nhow straight they swim\nturns out that swimming\nfor sperm is more efficient\nif they swim straight,\nas opposed to like those\nkids in on the swim team,\nthey're like banging up\nagainst the lane lines\nand zigzagging all over the place.\nSo it does turn out to be the\ncase that the quickest route\nbetween any two places is a straight line\nand the good sperm know that,\nand the less good sperm\ndon't seem to know that.\nAnd acetylcarnitine seems to\nfacilitate straight swimming\ntrajectories as well as speed of swimming\nand overall sperm health.\nAnd there is evidence from\nquality peer reviewed studies\nshowing that acetylcarnitine\nsupplementation can also be\nbeneficial for women's fertility\nin ways that it affects\nperhaps we don't really\nknow the mechanism,\nhealth and status of the\negg or egg implantation.\nThere are a large number of\nstudies on acetylcarnitine.\nYou can look those up\non Pub Med, if you like,\nor on examine.com.\nThere are some studies that I don't think\nare included there which are\nparticularly interesting.\nOne that I just would like\nto reference the last name\nof the first author is\nMahdavi M-A-H-D-A-V-I.\nThe title of the paper is\nEffects of l -Carnitine Supplementation\non Serum Inflammatory Markers\nand Matrix Metalloproteinases Enzymes\nin Females with Knee Osteoarthritis.\nSo this is a randomized double\nblind placebo controlled\npilot study that showed\nreally interesting effects\nof short term supplementation\nof acetylcarnitine.\nLonger term, the effects\nwere less impressive.\nSo it's pretty interesting\nthat this compound has\nso many different effects.\nHow could it have these effects?\nWell, it appears that\nit's having these effects\nthrough its impact on the\nso-called inflammatory cytokines.\nInflammatory cytokines for\nthose of you that don't know\nare secreted by the immune system\nin response to different stressors,\nphysical stressors, mental stressors too\nfood that you eat that isn't good for you.\nThe so-called hidden sugars.\nYes, will increase inflammation\nif they're ingested too often,\nor in amounts that are\ntoo high in quantity.\nThings like Interleukin 1 beta,\nthings like C-reactive protein,\nthings like interleukin 6.\nInterleukin 6 is kind of the\ngeneric inflammatory marker\nthat all studies refer to.\nAnd yet there are other interleukins,\nplease note that there\nare other interleukins\nlike interleukin 10 that\nare anti-inflammatory.\nSo immune system can secrete\ninflammatory molecules\nto deal with wounds and stress and things.\nAnd in the short term that's good,\nand in the longterm that's bad.\nAnd it can secrete anti-inflammatory\ncytokines like IL10.\nAnd these matrix metalloproteinases,\nit's kind of a mouthful,\nbut these matrix metalloproteinases\nare very interesting.\nAnytime you see A-S-E, ASE\nthat's generally an enzyme,\nwhich means that these\ncompounds in this case,\nthese matrix metalloproteinases are used\nto break down certain\nelements around wounds\nand scoring which might\nsound like a bad thing,\nbut in some cases is good\nbecause it allows certain cells\nlike glial cells so-called microglia\nto come in like low ambulances,\nlike low paramedics and clean up wounds.\nSo scarring and inflammation\nis kind of a double-edged sword.\nIt can be good, but too much scarring.\nIf it contains a wound too much,\ndoesn't allow the\ninfiltration of cell types\nto move in and take care of\nthat wound and heal it up.\nSo it appears that L-carnitine\nis impacting a number\nof different processes,\nboth to impact pain\nand perhaps, and I want\nto underscore perhaps,\nbut there are good studies happening now,\nperhaps accelerate wound healing as well.\nAs long as we're talking about acute pain\nand chronic pain and supplementation\nand non-prescription drugs,\nat least in the United States\nthat people can take to deal\nwith pain of various kinds,\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention the two\nthat I get asked most often about,\nwhich are agmatine and\nS-adenosyl-L-methionine,\nwhich is sometimes called SAMe.\nBoth of those have been\nshown to have some impact\ncategorized on examine as notable impact\non various forms of pain,\ndue to osteoarthritis,\nor due to injury of various\nkinds of indifferent subject\npopulation, men, women, people\nof different ages, et cetera.\nSAMe in particular has been interesting\nbecause it's been shown head to head\nwith drugs like Naproxen and\nother drugs of that sort,\nwhich are well established\nand sold over the counter\nin the US to work at least as well\nas some of those compounds\nat certain doses.\nBut it's also shown that SAMe\nand some of those things take more time\nin order to have those effects.\nIn fact, head to head\nwith things like Neproxin\nhave been shown that they\ncan take up to a month\nin order to have the\npain relieving effect.\nNow, whether or not that\nmakes them a better choice\nor a worst choice really\ndepends on your circumstances.\nI'm certainly not recommending\nthat anybody take anything,\nbut I do think it's interesting\nand important to point out\nthat things like\nagmatine, things like SAMe\nhave been shown under\ncertain circumstances\nto be beneficial for pain and\nthey are outside the realm\nof prescription drugs.\nI think this is a growing area of\nsome people call them supplements,\nsome people call them nutraceuticals.\nLook, at the end of the\nday these are compounds\nthat affect cellular processes.\nAnd the more that we understand\nhow they affect those cellar processes\nas we now do for things\nlike acetylcarnitine,\nI think the more trust\nthat we can put into them,\nor the more to which we\nmight want to avoid them\nbecause of some of the side effects\nor contra-indications that\nthose compounds could have.\nIf you're interested in\nthose other compounds,\nI do invite you as I always\ndo to check out examine.com,\nbut also to do your\nresearch on those compounds\nby simply putting them into Google\nor putting them into PubMed,\nwhich would be even better.\nAnd if you are going to go into PubMed,\nif you're going to\nstart playing scientist,\nwhich I do encourage you to do,\nI would encourage you to\nnot just read abstracts,\nbut if you can, if the\nstudies are freely available,\nI realized not all of\nthem are freely available\nto try and read those studies\nat least to the extent that you can.\nThere's a particularly nice\nstudy that you might look at\nthat was published in\n2010 in Pain Medicine,\nwhich is Keynan et al K-E-Y-N-A-N,\nwhich looked at the safety and efficacy\nof dietary agmatine sulfate\non lumbar disc associated radiculopathy\nnot laughing at the condition.\nIt's a painful condition that describes a,\nit's a kind of a range\nof symptoms that relate\nto pinching of nerves.\nThe spinal columns,\nI was laughing at my pronunciation of it.\nThat particular study is quite good.\nAnd the conclusion of that\nstudy that they drew was that\nthere were limited side effects\nand that dietary agmatine sulfate is safe\nand efficacious for treating\nand alleviating pain\nand improving quality of life\nand lumbar-disc associated pain.\nHowever, there were very\nspecific dosage regimens\nthat were described there\nand duration of treatment.\nAnd so you should not take\nanything that I say or that study\nto mean that you can just\ntake this stuff willy-nilly\nor at any concentration\nof course, or dose.\nYou always want to pay attention\nto what the science says.\nThat paper fortunately is\nfreely available online.\nAnd we will also provide\na link to that study.\nFor those of you that\nare interested in SAMe\nand its usage for the treatment\nof various types of pain,\nand perhaps other benefits,\na number of companies\nhave stopped making SAMe\ninstead what they're now\nfocusing on is what they think\nis a better or more\nbioavailable alternative,\nwhich is 5-methyltetrahydrofolate\nor 5-MTHF.\nThis molecule is necessary\nfor converting homocysteine\nto methionine, which is\nthen converted to SAMe\nso rather than taking SAMe directly,\nthe idea is to take\nsomething that's upstream\nof SAMe and make more SAMe\nendogenously available.\nThis is a different strategy.\nI've talked about this strategy before\nfor increasing other things\nlike growth hormone, et cetera.\nThere's always this\nquestion of whether or not\nin trying to increase the\namount of a particular molecule\nin the body, whether or not\ntaking that specific molecule\nwas the best thing or\nworking further upstream\nas it's referred to\nworking on the precursor\nor increasing the levels of the precursor\nis the better way to go.\nIt appears that this\n5-MTHF is the strategy\nthat people are now taking in\nplace of taking SAMe directly.\nSo in other words, they're taking this\nin order to get elevated levels of SAMe.\nNow, I'd like to turn our attention\nto a completely non drug, non\nsupplement related approach\nto dealing with pain.\nAnd it's one that has existed\nfor thousands of years.\nAnd that only recently has the\nWestern scientific community\nstarted to pay serious attention to,\nbut they have started to\npay serious attention to it.\nAnd there is terrific mechanistic\nscience to now explain\nhow and why acupuncture can work very well\nfor the treatment of\ncertain forms of pain.\nNow, first off, I want to\ntell you what was told to me\nby our director or Chief\nof the Pain Division\nat Stanford School of\nMedicine, Dr. Sean Mackey,\nwhich was that some\npeople respond very well\nto acupuncture and others do not.\nAnd the challenge is\nidentifying who'll respond well\nand who won't respond well.\nNow, when I say won't respond well,\nthat doesn't necessarily\nmean that they responded\nin a negative way, that\nit was bad for them,\nbut it does appear that\na fraction of people\nexperienced tremendous pain\nrelief from acupuncture\nand others experience\nnone at all or very little\nto the point where they have to seek out\nother forms of treatment.\nThe science on this is still ongoing.\nThere was actually an excellent\npaper published on this\nin the Journal of the\nAmerican Medical Association,\none of the premier\nmedical clinical journals.\nAnd it basically reinforced the idea\nthat you have responders\nand non-responders.\nA number of laboratories\nhave started to explore\nhow acupuncture works.\nAnd one of the premier\nlaboratories for this\nis Qiufu Ma's lab at\nHarvard Medical School.\nQiufu has spent many years\nstudying the pain system\nand a system that's\nrelated to the pain system,\nwhich is the system that\ncontrols our sensation of itch.\nJust as a brief aside about itch,\nitch and pain are often co\nassociated with one another.\nI was recently in Texas,\nand I will tell you,\nthey have some mean mosquitoes.\nThey're small, but\nwhatever they're injecting\ninto your skin.\nWell, here I am talking now\nabout my subjective experience\nof pain, whatever they\ninjected into my skin\nfelt to me like the most\nextreme mosquito bites\nI've ever had, not while\nthey were biting me,\nnot while they were\ninjecting the venom, but boy,\nthose Texas mosquitoes make me itch.\nHow do they do it?\nWell, their venom creates little packets\nof so-called histamine that travel around\nthose packets are called mast cells,\nlittle packets of histamine\nthat go to that location\nand make me and presumably you\nwant to scratch those mosquito bites.\nI scratch mine you scratch yours,\nbut we both scratch our mosquito bites.\nAnd when we do that, the\nhistamines are released.\nThat gets red and inflamed\nand the itch even worse.\nThe inflammation is actually\ncaused by the histamine.\nWell, that experience of\ninflammation and pain and itch\nis what we call a pyrogenic experience.\nSo we we have pain which is\nnociception, essentially,\nI know that the pain of aficionado\nalways get a little upset\nbecause they say, oh,\nthere's no such thing\nas as a pain receptor,\nit's no susceptive receptors\nand pain is subjective experience.\nYes, I acknowledge all that.\nBut for fluency, let's\njust think about pain\nas a certain experience and\nitch as a separate experience,\nbut they often exist together\nbecause those mosquito bites\nwere what I would call painful,\nor at least not pleasant.\nThey didn't just itch,\nthey were also painful nuts\nbecause itch brings with it inflammation\nand inflammation often\nbrings with it pain relief,\nbut it can also bring with\nit the sensation of pain.\nSo itch and pain are\ntwo separate phenomenon.\nIt was actually discovered\nthrough a really interesting\nphenomenon that relates to something\nthat is actually consumed\nin supplement form,\nwhich is this tropical legume.\nIt's actually a bean\ncalled Mucuna pruriens.\nThat's M-U-C-U-N-A that's\none word P-R-U-I-E-N-S\nMucuna pruriens is a bean,\nit's as legume that this bean\nis 99% L-DOPA.\nIt's dopamine or rather it's\nthe precursor to dopamine\nand people buy this stuff\nand take it over the counter\nas ways to increase\ntheir levels of dopamine.\nIt does make you feel\nreally dopamine doubt,\nmeaning it makes you feel a\nlittle high and really motivated\nand really energetic\na lot like other drugs\nthat will do that.\nI don't necessarily recommend\ntaking Mucuna pruriens.\nI personally don't like taking it.\nDoesn't make me feel good.\nI crash really hard when I take it.\nBut on the outside of\nthis bean is a compound\nthat makes people itch.\nSo they remove this when you\ntake it in supplement form.\nIn fact, it's usually in capsule form,\nbut the outside of this\nbean, it's like a hairy bean.\nAnd those little hairs contain a compound,\nwhich was actually used\nto study and identify\nthese itchy receptors in the skin.\nSo we don't have time to go\ninto all the details of itch,\nbut it's pretty interesting\nthat you have these compounds\nout in nature that can make us itch.\nInside them they have dopamine.\nI mean, this is really weird,\nbut plant compounds are really powerful.\nSo don't let anyone tell\nyou that because something's\nfrom a plant or an earth\nthat it's not powerful.\nThere are very powerful\nplant and herb compounds.\nMucuna prurien being one of\nthem with dopamine on the inside\nand itchy stuff on the outside.\nNow, what does this all\nhave to do with acupuncture?\nWell, Qiufu Ma's lab\nhas not just identified\nthe itch pathway, this pruritus\ngenes as they're called,\nwhich causes itch and\nthe pyrogenic phenomenon\nof itch being separate from pain.\nHis lab has also studied how\nacupuncture causes relief of,\nbut also can exacerbate pain.\nNow, the form of acupuncture\nthat they explored\nwas one that's commonly in\nuse called electroacupuncture.\nSo this isn't just putting little needles\ninto different parts of the body.\nThese needles are able to\npass an electrical current,\nnot magically, but because they have\na little wire going back to a device\nand you can pass electrical current.\nHere's what they found.\nThis is a study published\nin the journal neuron\nCell Press journal, excellent\njournal, very high stringency.\nSo what Qiufu Ma's lab found\nwas that if electroacupuncture\nis provided to the abdomen,\nto the stomach area,\nit creates activation of what are called\nthe sympathetic ganglia.\nThese have nothing to do with sympathy\nin the emotional sense has to\ndo with the stress response.\nSympa just means together.\nSo it activated a bunch of\nneurons along the spinal cord.\nAnd the activation of\nthese neurons evolves\nneural adrenaline and something\ncalled NPY neuropeptide Y.\nThe long and short of it is\nthat stimulating the abdomen\nwith electroacupuncture was\neither anti-inflammatory\nor it could cause inflammation.\nIt could actually exacerbate\ninflammation depending\non whether or not it was\nof low or high intensity.\nNow that makes it a very\nprecarious technique.\nAnd this may speak to some of the reason\nwhy some people report\nrelief from acupuncture\nand others do not.\nHowever, they went a step further\nand stimulated other areas\nof the body using electroacupuncture.\nAnd what they found is that\nstimulation of the legs\nof the hind limbs, as\nit's called an animals,\nand the legs in humans caused a circuit,\na neural circuit to be activated that goes\nfrom the legs up to an area\nof the base of the brain\ncalled the DMV not the DMH,\nwhich I mentioned earlier,\nbut the DMV like you go to the DMV,\nwhich is a miserable experience\nfor most people, forgive me,\nDMV employees, but let's be honest\nmost people don't enjoy\ngoing to the DMV as patrons,\nbut we have to so we go.\nThe DMV and low intensity stimulation,\nthis electroacupuncture of the\nhind limbs activated the DMV\nand activated the adrenal glands,\nwhich sit at top of your\nkidneys and cause the release\nof what are called catecholamines.\nAnd those were strongly anti-inflammatory.\nIn other words, electroacupuncture\nof the legs and feet can,\nif done correctly, be anti-inflammatory\nand reduce symptoms of pain.\nAnd can we think accelerate wound healing\nbecause activations of these\ncatecholaminergic pathways\ncan accelerate wound healing as well.\nSo the takeaway from this is\nthat while there are thousands\nof years and millions of\nsubjects involved in explorations\nof electroacupuncture and acupuncture,\nWestern medicine is\nstarting to come into this\nand start to explore underlying mechanism.\nNow, for those of you\nthat love acupuncture\nand are real proponents of it,\nit's worked for you, you might say,\nwell, why does Western medicine\neven need to come into this?\nWhy should they even be exploring this?\nBut we should all be\nrelieved that they are\nbecause what's starting to happen now\nis that as the mechanistic basis for this\nis starting to come to light,\ninsurance coverage of\nthings like acupuncture\nis starting to emerge as well.\nAnd this is in contrast to other therapies\nfor which there's a lot\nof anecdotal evidence,\nbut very little mechanistic understanding.\nOne example of that would\nbe laser photo biomodulation\nthe use of lasers of\ndifferent types really\nto treat pain and to\naccelerate wound healing.\nA lot of people claim that\nthis can really help them.\nHowever, most places,\nat least in the States,\nwon't cover this with insurance\nor don't perform this in standard clinics.\nAnd the reason is the underlying\nmechanism isn't known.\nI'm not going to get into the\nargument about whether or not\nmechanistic understanding\nshould or should not be required\nin order to have insurance\ncoverage of things that work.\nThat's not what this is about.\nAnd that actually will\nbe a boring discussion\nbecause I'm shouting at\na tunnel through you.\nAnd I wouldn't be able\nto hear you shout back\nno matter what your stance on that is,\nbut just trust me when I\nsay that I am both relieved\nand delighted to hear that\nexcellent medical institutions\nlike Stanford are starting to\nthink about electroacupuncture\nand how it can work.\nThat places like Harvard\nMedical School are starting\nto explore this at a mechanistic level.\nAnd I do believe that\nthere's an open-mindedness\nthat starting to emerge for instance,\nthe National Institutes of Health,\nnot only has an institute\nfor mental health\nand cancer research and an eye institute,\nbut now complementary\nhealth, the so-called NCCIH.\nNational Institutes of\nComplementary Health\nthat is exploring things\nlike electroacupuncture,\nmeditation, various supplements\nand things of those sort.\nI do think that we're entering\na new realm in which things\nlike pain and pain management\nwill be met with more openness\nby all physicians, at\nleast that's my hope.\nSo please take that into\nconsideration right now.\nThe mechanistic evidence\nfor laser photobiomodulation\nis not strong.\nOne of the major issues\nor the barriers to that\nis that most of the\nstudies that are out there\nwere actually paid for by companies\nthat build devices for\nlaser photobiomodulation.\nAnd so we really need\nindependent studies funded\nby federal institutions that have no bias\nor financial relationship\nin order to gain trust\nin whatever data happen to emerge.\nThere is a technique that at one time\nwas considered alternative,\nbut now has a lot of mechanistic science\nto explain how it works,\nand it does indeed work\nfor the treatment of chronic\nand also for acute pain.\nAnd that treatment is hypnosis\nin particular self-hypnosis.\nNow, my colleague at Stanford\nin fact, my collaborator,\nDr. David Spiegel, our\nAssociate Chair of Psychiatry\nhas devoted his professional life\nto developing hypnosis\ntools that people can use\nto help them sleep better, focus better,\nstay motivated, et cetera.\nWhile most people hear\nhypnosis and they think,\noh, this is stage hypnosis.\nPeople walking around like chickens\nare being forced to laugh\nor fall asleep on command, et cetera.\nThis is completely\ndifferent than all that.\nThis is self hypnosis\nand there are now dozens,\nif not more quality peer\nreviewed studies published\nin excellent journals done by Dr. Spiegel\nand others at other universities.\nIt really all has to do\nwith how self-hypnosis\ncan modulate activity\nof the prefrontal cortex\nand related structures like the insula.\nThe prefrontal cortex is involved\nin our executive function\nas it's called, our planning,\nour decision making,\nbut also how we interpret context,\nwhat the meaning of a given sensation is.\nAnd that's extremely powerful.\nI just want to remind\neverybody that the currency\nof the brain and body has not changed\nin hundreds of thousands of years.\nIt's always been dopamine,\nserotonin, glutamate,\nGABA, testosterone, estrogen.\nWhat's changed are the contingencies,\nthe events in the world\nthat drive whether or not\nwe get an increase or decrease\nin testosterone or estrogen,\nthe events in the world\nthat dictate whether or not\nwe get an increase or\na decrease in dopamine.\nBelieve me, the events\nthat drove those increases\nand decreases were very\ndifferent even a 100 years ago\nthan they are now.\nAnd as we create new things and\nsocieties change, et cetera,\nthey will continue to exchange information\nin the same currency, which\nis dopamine, serotonin,\nand all these other\nneuromodulators and chemicals.\nHypnosis takes advantage of this\nby allowing an individual,\nyou, if you like\nto change the way that you\ninterpret particular events\nand to actually experience\nwhat would be painful\nas less painful or not painful.\nAnd that's just the example of pain.\nHypnosis is powerful\nfor other reasons too.\nIt actually can help\nrewire neural circuits\nso that you don't experience as much pain\nso that you can sleep\nfaster, focus faster.\nIf this is all sounding very fantastical\nwell, it's supported by data.\nThe data are that when\npeople do self-hypnosis\neven brief self-hypnosis\nof 10 or 15 minutes,\na few times a week, maybe\neven returned to that hypnosis\nby just using a one minute a day hypnosis,\nthey can achieve significant\nand often very impressive\ndegrees of pain relief in chronic pain\nwhether or not that chronic pain arises\nthrough things like fibromyalgia\nor through other sources.\nIf you want to check this out,\nthere's a wonderful zero cost resource\nthat's grounded in this work.\nIt's the app reveri.com.\nSo R-E-V-E-R-I.com.\nThere you can download a zero cost app\nfor Apple phones or for Android phones.\nAnd there are a variety of\ndifferent hypnosis scripts.\nThese are actually self hypnosis scripts,\nand you'll actually hear Dr.\nDavid Spiegel talking to you.\nHe can teach you about\nhypnosis and how it works.\nThere are links to scientific studies\nthat web address that I\ngave you before reveri.com.\nYou can see the various studies\nand the various write-ups\nrelated to those studies\nand how this all works.\nAnd they're simple protocols.\nYou just click on a tab and\nyou listen to the self-hypnosis\nand it will take you into hypnosis.\nAnd several of those hypnosis\ngrips have been shown\nclinically to relieve certain\npatterns of chronic pain.\nSo it's a powerful tool,\nand I encourage you not\nto write off the non-drug\nnon supplement tools\nas less than powerful\nbecause indeed many people\nexperience tremendous relief from them.\nAnd of course, they also can be combined\nwith drug treatments\nif that's right for you\nor with supplements and things\nof that sort to treat pain,\nif that's right for you.\nSo again, electroacupuncture\nnow often supported\nby insurance, not always, but often.\nGreat mechanistic data starting to emerge.\nHypnosis, terrific tool.\nThere's even the self-hypnosis\ntool that one can access\nthrough the zero cost app Reveri\nand lots of great clinical data\nand scientific mechanistic data.\nThere are neuro imaging studies showing\nthat different brain areas\nare activated in hypnosis\nthe so-called default network,\nkind of where your brains is kind of idols\nand the different circuits\nthat are active in at rest\nshift with hypnosis and shift long-term\nin ways that positively conserve you.\nAnd then these things like\nlaser photobiomodulation\nstill more or less in that\nexperimental medical community.\nI should say, Western Medical\nCommunity, not so certain,\nbut hopefully there will be data soon,\nand hopefully those data\nwill point to mechanisms\nthat allow the insurance companies\nand other sort of medical\nbodies to support them\nif indeed they have a mechanistic basis.\nI just want to briefly touch on\na common method of pain relief\nthat speaks to a more general principle\nof how things like electroacupuncture,\nand also some of these\nnew emerging techniques\nof kind of like active tissue release\nand this principle that\nyou hear a lot about\nin sports medicine now that\nwhen you have pain or injury\nat one site, that you\nshould provide pressure\nabove and below that site.\nYou may have seen this in the\nOlympics, which is ongoing now\nwhere people will put tape on their body\nat certain locations oftentimes.\nThe logic or what they're\nsaying is that this is designed\nto create relief in a joint or in a limb\nthat's below the tape, not\nnecessarily under the tape,\nbut above or below.\nSo for instance, if there's\npain in one shoulder,\nsometimes we'll put it\non the trapezius muscle\nor things of that sort.\nIt turns out that there\nis a basis for this\nbecause of the way that\nthese different nerves run in\nfrom the skin and from the\nmuscles up into the spinal cord\nand into the brainstem providing pressure\non one nerve pathway can\noften impact another pathway.\nAnd the simplest and most\ncommon example of this is one\nthat we all do\ninstinctually or intuitively\neven animals do this.\nThis is something that in the\ntextbooks is all is called\nthe Gate Theory of Pain\ndeveloped by Melzack and Wall\nkind of classic theory.\nBasically we have receptors in our skin,\nthe so-called C fibers, that's just a name\nfor these little wires that come\nfrom a particular class\nof DRGs that's very thin\nthat brings about certain kinds\nof nasal scepter information.\nI want to say pain information,\nbut then the pain people believe\nare not their pain people.\nSometimes they're a pain\nbecause what they tell me\nis they're on pain\nreceptors okay, nociceptors\nThat information comes in C fibers\nand what happens when we injure something\nwell, provided that we won't\ndamage it worse by touching it,\noftentimes what we will do is\nwe will rub the source of pain\nor the location in which\nwe were experiencing pain.\nAnd it turns out that's not\nan unuseful thing to do.\nWhen we rub our skin or an area,\nor we provide pressure nearby it,\nwe activate the so-called A fibers,\nthe bigger wires and\nneurons that innovate,\nmeaning they jut into that area of skin.\nAnd those A fibers, the ones that respond\nto mechanical pressure\nactually are able to inhibit\nthose C fibers, the ones that are carrying\nthat so-called pain information.\nSo rubbing an area or providing\npressure above or below\nan injury actually provides\nreal pain relief support\nfor the location of\nthat injury or that pain\nbecause of the way that\nthese different patterns\nor these different types\nof neurons interact\nwith one another.\nAnd when I say it inhibits it,\nI don't mean that it like shouts at it,\nwhat it does is it releases\nit's literally kind of\nlike vomits up a little\nbit of a neurotransmitter\ncalled GABA.\nAnd GABA is a\nneurotransmitter that inhibits\nit quiets the activity of other neurons.\nAnd so it's acting as kind\nof an analgesic, if you will,\nit's acting as its own\nform of drug that you make\nwith your body to quiet the\nactivity of these pain neurons.\nSo rubbing a wound\nprovided it doesn't damage\nthe wound worse or providing\npressure above or below\ntypically it's above a particular injury\ncan have a real effect in\nrelieving some of the pain\nof that injury.\nAnd some people have speculated\nthis as through fascia,\nor this is through other\nbodily organs and tissues.\nAnd it might be we're going to\ndo a whole episode on fascia.\nIt's extremely interesting tissue,\nbut right now it seems\nthat the main source\nof that pain relief is through\nthis A fiber inhibition\nof these C fibers\nso-called Melzack and Wall\nGate Theory of Pain if\nyou'd like to look it up\nand learn about that further.\nNow, let's talk about a phenomenon\nthat has long intrigued\nand perplexed people\nfor probably thousands of years.\nAnd that's redheads.\nYou may have heard before that\nredheads have a higher pain\nthreshold than other individuals.\nAnd indeed, that is true.\nThere's now a study that\nlooked at this mechanistically.\nThere's a gene called the MC1R gene.\nAnd this MC1R gene encodes\nfor a number of different proteins.\nSome of those proteins\nof course are related\nto the production of melanin.\nThis is why redheads often not always,\nbut often are very fair skinned.\nSometimes have freckles, not always.\nAnd of course have red hair.\nSome people are really intense ginger's\nnot psychologically or emotionally\nintense perhaps that too,\nbut meaning their hair is very, very red.\nOthers, it's a lighter red.\nSo of course there's\nvariation here, but this gene,\nthis MC1R gene is associated\nwith a pathway that relates\nto something that I've talked\nabout on this podcast before\nduring the episode on hunger\nand feeding and this is POMC.\nPOMC stands for pro-opiomelanocortin\nand POMC is cut up.\nIt's cleaved into different hormones,\nincluding one that\nenhances pain perception.\nThis is melanocyte stimulating hormone.\nAnd another one that\nblocks pain beta endorphin.\nNow, if you listen to the\nepisodes on testosterone\nand estrogen and the episodes\non hunger and feeding,\nsome of these molecules\nwill start to ring a bell.\nThings like melano\nstimulating hormone relate\nto pigmentation of the skin\nrelate to sexual arousal, et cetera,\nbut it turns out that in red heads,\nbecause of the fact that\nthey have this gene,\nthis MC1R gene, the POMC\nPro-opiomelanocortin,\nthat's cut into different hormones,\nmelanocyte-stimulating hormones\nand another one beta endorphin.\nBeta endorphin should cue you to the fact\nthat this is in the pain pathway.\nThe endorphins are endogenously made,\nmeaning made within our body opioids.\nThey actually make us feel numb\nin response to certain kinds of pain.\nNow, not completely numb,\nbut they numb or reduce\nour perception of pain\nbecause of the ways in\nwhich they are released\nfrom certain brain centers.\nWe'll talk about those\nbrain centers in a moment.\nSo what's really interesting\nis that this study showed\nthat the presence of these\nhormones is in everybody.\nWe all have melanocortin 4,\nwe all have beta endorphins.\nWe all have POMC et cetera,\nbut red heads make more of\nthese endogenous endorphins.\nAnd that's interesting.\nIt allows them to buffer\nagainst the pain response.\nI have a personal anecdote\nto share with you about\nthis red head and heightened levels\nof pain tolerance phenomenon.\nObviously I'm not a redhead.\nI don't dye my hair, but\nmy partner for many years\nwas a red head and still is a red head.\nShe had bright red hair and\nhad that since childhood.\nWell, we had the fortunate experience\nof becoming friends\nwith Wim Hof and family.\nThey actually came out to\nvisit us and did a series\nof seminars in the bay area.\nThis was in 2016, as I recall.\nAnd my partner, she had\nnever done an ice bath.\nShe had never done any kind\nof real cold water exposure\nexperience before, but as\none particular gathering\nas is often the case when women's around,\nthere was an ice bath and a\nnumber of people were getting\ninto this thing.\nThis was actually before a dinner event.\nAnd I think for most people\nwho have never done an ice bath\ngetting in for 30 seconds\nor a minute is tolerable,\nbut it takes some effort.\nIt takes some willpower\nand take some overcoming\nthat pain barrier 'cause\nit is a little bit painful.\nNot a lot.\nSome people can stay in longer\nthree minutes, five minutes\nwithout much discomfort.\nWhat was incredible is\nthat without any desire\nto compete with anybody else,\nmy partner redhead got into the ice bath\nand just like sat there for 10 minutes.\nIn fact, at one point she\njust kind of turned to me\nand said, \"I don't really feel pain.\nI'm not really in pain.\"\nAnd Wim loved this.\nWim thought it was great.\nHe thought it was the most\nterrific thing in the world.\nAnd he got back in the ice bath\nand they became fast friends,\nand I think they're\nprobably still fast friends.\nSo in any event, that's an end of one.\nWhat we call an anecdata example.\nAnecdata is not really a term\nthat we should use too much\n'cause it's N of one\nanecdotes are just that.\nThey're just anecdotes.\nBut it's been described many\ntimes in various clinics\nby anesthesiologists, by\nobservation of coaches, et cetera,\nthat redheads men and\nwomen who are redheads\nseem to have this higher pain threshold.\nAnd it does seem to be because\ntheir body naturally produces\nways to counter the pain response.\nThey produce their own endogenous opioids.\nNow this of course should not\nbe taken to mean that redheads\ncan tolerate more pain and\ntherefore should be subjected\nto more pain, all it means\nis that their threshold\nfor pain on average, not all of them,\nbut on average is shifted higher\nthan that of other individuals.\nAnd it remains to be\ndetermined whether or not\nother light skin, light haired individuals\nalso have a heightened\nlevel of pain threshold.\nAnd I should mention because\nI mentioned the ice bath\nthat of course pain threshold is something\nthat can be built up and\nprovide you do that safely\nin ways that aren't damaging your tissues\nbecause of course, pain is a signal\nthat is designed to help you\nto keep from harming yourself,\nbut provided that you can\ndo that in a way that's safe\nand doesn't damage your tissues,\nincreasing your pain threshold\nthrough the use of things\nlike ice baths is something\nthat really can be done.\nIt has a lot to do with these contextual\nor top-down modulations of the experience.\nYou can tell yourself\nthat this is good for me,\nor I'm doing this by\nchoice or whatever it is.\nYou can distract yourself.\nThere are a huge number of different ways\nthat one could do that.\nOne of the more interesting ways\nfor which there are actually\nreally good scientific data\ncome from my colleagues,\nSean Mackey's Lab.\nAnd that actually looked at\nhow love and in particular,\nthe experience of obsessive\nlove could actually counter\nthe pain response, not just\nin redheads, but in everybody.\nSo that study I'll just briefly describe\nit involved having people\ncome into the laboratory\nand experience any one or a number\nof different painful stimuli,\nbut they had selectively\nrecruited subjects\nthat were in new relationships\nfor which there was a\nhigh degree of infatuation\nso much so that the people\ncouldn't stop thinking about\nor communicating with that new partner\nup to 80% of their waking\ntime, which is a lot.\nThat constant obsessing about that partner\nwas correlated with.\nIt wasn't causal necessarily,\nbut was correlated with\nthe ability to sustain\nhigher levels of pain\nthan people who were in\nmore typical non obsessive\nforms of love, longstanding relationships,\nwhere there wasn't long\nobsessive love rather.\nAnd of course in this study,\nthere were a lot of good control groups.\nThey included a distractor,\nthey included people\nobsessing about other things,\ntheir pet, et cetera.\nThey included other forms\nof love and attachment,\nbut it does seem that\ncertain patterns of thinking\ncan allow us to buffer ourselves\nagainst the pain response.\nAnd that should not be surprising.\nCertain forms of thinking are\nassociated with the release\nof particular neuromodulators\nin particular dopamine.\nAnd dopamine, it may\nseem is kind of the thing\nthat underlies everything, but it's not.\nDopamine is a molecule that's associated\nwith novelty expectation,\nmotivation, and reward.\nWe talked about this at the\nbeginning of the episode,\nthat it's really the molecule\nof expectation and motivation\nand hope and excitement\nmore than it's associated\nwith the receival of the reward.\nWell, dopamine is coursing\nthroughout the brain\nat heightened levels and\ncoursing throughout the body\nat heightened levels when we fall in love.\nThis probably has some adaptive mechanism\nthat ensure paired bonding between people\nor who knows, maybe it ensured not bonding\nto multiple people.\nNobody really knows how dopamine functions\nin terms of pair bonding,\nbut it is known that\nwhen people fall in love,\nnew relationships create\nvery high levels of dopamine.\nAnd that's probably the mechanistic basis\nby which these people were able\nto buffer the pain response\nby thinking about their partner\nor this new relationship\nthat they're in almost\nobsessively or obsessively.\nNow that raises a deeper question\nwe should always be asking.\nYeah, but how, how?\nWell, the dopamine system\ncan have powerful effects\non the inflammation system.\nAnd it doesn't do this\nthrough mysterious ways.\nIt does this by interacting\nthrough the brainstem\nand some of the neurons\nthat innervate the spleen\nand other areas of the body,\nthat deploy cells to go combat infection,\ninflammation, and pain.\nAnd the ways in which\ndopamine can modulate pain,\nand in this case, this particular study\ntransform our experience of pain.\nMaybe even to something that's pleasureful\nis not mysterious.\nIt's really through the\nactivation of brainstem neurons\nthat communicate with areas of our body,\nthat deploy things like immune cells.\nSo for instance, we have\nneurons in our brain stem\nthat can be modulated by\nthe release of dopamine\nand those neurons in the\nbrainstem control the release\nof immune cells from\ntissues like the spleen\nor organs like the spleen.\nAnd those immune cells can\nthen go combat infection.\nWe've heard before that when we're happy,\nwe're better able to combat\ninfection, deal with pain,\ndeal with all sorts of things\nthat essentially makes us more resilient.\nAnd that's not because dopamine\nis some magic molecule,\nit's because dopamine\naffects particular circuits\nand tells in a very neuro-biological way\nin a biochemical way tells\nthose cells and circuits\nthat conditions are good.\nDespite the fact that\nthere's pain in the body\nconditions are good.\nYou're in love or conditions are good.\nYou want to be in this experience.\nOr conditions are good\nthis is for a greater cause\nthat you're fighting or suffering\nfor some larger purpose.\nSo all of that has existed\nlargely in the realm\nof psychology and even\nmotivational literature\nin this kind of thing,\nbut there's a real\nmechanistic basis for it.\nDopamine is a molecule that\ncan bind to receptor sites\non these brain areas.\nThose brain areas can then\nmodulate the organs and tissues\nof the body that can allow\nus to lean into challenge.\nAnd those challenges can be infection,\nit can be physical pain, it\ncan be long bouts of effort\nthat are required of us.\nAnd I think many people\nhave described the feeling\nof being newly in love as a\nheightened level of energy,\na capacity do anything.\nI mean, the whole concept\nof a muse is one in which\nsome individual or some\nthing either imagined or real\nenters our life and we\ncan use that as fuel.\nAnd that fuel is chemical fuel\nand that chemical fuel is dopamine.\nAnd it really does allow\nfor more resilience\nand can even transform\nthe experience of pain\nor what would otherwise be pain\ninto an experience of pleasure.\nSo, along those lines,\nlet's talk about pleasure.\nWith all the cells and\ntissues and machinery related\nto pain, you might think\nthat our entire touch system\nis designed to allow us to detect pain\nand to avoid tissue damage and well,\na good percentage of\nit is devoted to that.\nA good percentage of it is also devoted\nto this thing that we call pleasure.\nAnd that should come as no surprise.\nPleasure isn't just\nthere for our pleasure.\nIt serves adaptive role,\nand that adaptive role relates to the fact\nthat every species has a primary goal\nwhich is to make more of itself\notherwise it would go extinct.\nThat process of making more\nof itself sexual reproduction\nis closely associated with the sensation\nand the perception of pleasure.\nAnd it's no surprise that not\nonly is the highest density\nof sensory receptors in and\non and around the genitalia,\nbut the process of\nreproduction evokes sensations\nand molecules and perceptions\nassociated with pleasure.\nAnd the currency of pleasure exists\nin multiple chemical systems\nbut the primary ones\nare the dopamine system,\nwhich is the anticipation of pleasure\nand the work required\nto achieve the ability\nto experience that pleasure,\nand the serotonin system\nwhich is more closely related\nto the immediate experience\nof that pleasure.\nAnd from dopamine and serotonin\nstem out other hormones\nand molecules, things like oxytocin,\nwhich are associated with pair bonding.\nOxytocin is more closely associated\nwith the serotonin system biochemically\nand at the circuit level\nmeaning the areas of the brain\nand body that manufacture\na lot of serotonin,\nusually not always, but\nusually contain neurons\nthat also manufacturer and make use\nof the molecule oxytocin.\nThose chemicals together\ncreate sensations of warmth,\nof well being, of safety.\nThe dopamine molecule is\nmore closely associated\nwith hormones like testosterone\nand other molecules involved with pursuit\nand further effort in order\nto get more of whatever\ncould potentially cause\nmore release of dopamine.\nSo this is a very broad strokes,\nno pun intended description\nof the pleasure system.\nThere are of course,\nother molecules as well.\nOne in particular that's very interesting\nis something called PEA.\nPEA, it stands for Phenethylamine\nsometimes also referred\nto as Phenethylamine\ndepending on who you\nare and where you live,\nhow you pronounce it\ndoesn't really matter.\nPEA is a molecule, which\nis incredibly potent\nat augmenting or increasing the activity\nof certain cells and neural circuits\nthat relate to the pleasure system.\nPEA has purportedly been\nthought to be released\nin response to ingestion of\nthings like certain forms\nof dark chocolate.\nSome people take it in supplement form.\nIt's a bit of a stimulant,\nbut it also seems to heighten\nthe perception of pleasure\nin response to a particular\namount of dopamine\nand or serotonin.\nSo for instance, in a kind\nof a arbitrary experiment\nand units type example,\nif a given experience evokes a particular\namount of serotonin and dopamine\nand gives rise to a subjective\nexperience of pleasure\nof say level three out of 10,\nthe ingestion of PEA prior to\nthat experience can increase\nthe rating of that experience\nas more pleasureful.\nMaybe a four or a five, or even a six.\nAnd PEA is known to be present in\nor I should say it's releases stimulated\nby a number of different\ncompounds, such as dark chocolate,\ncertain things like\naspartame and certain people\ncan actually increase the\namount of PEA released.\nSome of these glutamate related\nmolecules like aspartame\nor things are in the glutamate pathway\ncan increase PEA release.\nAnd then some people\nwill actually take PEA\nin supplement form for its\nmild stimulant properties\nas well as for increasing\nthe perception of,\nor the ability to experience pleasure.\nIt's not a sledgehammer.\nIt's not like dopamine itself.\nPeople that take things\nlike Mucuna pruriens, L-DOPA\nor drugs of abuse, which I\ncertainly don't recommend\nthings like cocaine or amphetamine\nexperience tremendous\nincreases in dopamine,\nnot so much increases in serotonin.\nSome people will take\nserotonin in precursor form\nlike 5HTP or serotonin itself,\nor they'll take the amino acid\nprecursor like tryptophan.\nI'm not saying these\nthings as recommendations\nfor increasingly one sense of pleasure,\nI'm describing them\nbecause of what they do\ngenerally falls into two categories.\nThe first category is\nto raise the foundation,\nwhat we call the tonic level\nof dopamine and serotonin.\nSo if levels of serotonin\nand dopamine are too low,\nit becomes almost impossible\nto experience pleasure.\nThere's a so-called anhedonia.\nThis is also described as depression.\nAlthough it needn't be\nlong-term depression.\nSo certain drugs like antidepressants\nlike Wellbutrin Bupropion\nas it's commonly called\nor the so-called SSRI,\nthe serotonin selective\nre-uptake inhibitors\nlike Prozac, Zoloft and\nsimilar will increase dopamine\nand serotonin respectively.\nThey're not increasing the\npeaks in those molecules.\nWhat we call the acute\nrelease of those molecules,\nwhat they're doing is they're\nraising the overall levels\nof those molecules.\nThey're raising the sort of foundation\nor the tide if you will,\nthink about it as your mood\nor your pleasure rather\nis like a boat, and if it's on the shore\nand it can't get out to sea,\nunless that tide is high enough,\nthat's kind of the way to\nthink about these tonic levels\nof dopamine and serotonin.\nNow, most of us fortunately,\ndo not have problems with our\nbaseline or autonic levels\nof dopamine and serotonin release.\nThings like PEA in that case\nwill cause a slight increase\nin that tide and make the\nability of certain experiences\nto increase dopamine\nfurther more available.\nWhat we call this in neurosciences\nso-called gain control.\nI can kind of turn up the volume,\nbring us closer to the threshold\nto activate certain circuits.\nAnd this is really what we mean\nwhen we say a neuromodulator, okay?\nThis is why when you are\nvery happy about something,\nlet's say you're out with your friends.\nYou're really excited.\nMaybe depending on where\nyou live and what's going on\nin your area of the world right now,\nlike I have a niece and she's\nbeen locked up in quarantine\nfor a long time recently\nbecause it was deemed safe.\nShe got to go to summer camp.\nI have never seen that kid so happy\nto spend with her friends.\nShe was so excited and\nit was really amazing\nto see how excited she was.\nHer baseline levels of\ndopamine were clearly up\nso much so that when she saw her friends,\nshe literally started squealing.\nThey were squealing, she was squealing.\nEveryone was squealing.\nI wasn't squealing.\nI would admit it if I was squealing.\nI wasn't squealing, but it\nwas such a delight to see\nand I'm sure that made\nmy dopamine levels go up,\nwhich was, she was just so\nexcited such that anything\nand everything felt like\nan exciting stimulus.\nThis is pleasure, right?\nAnd I don't want to\nwrite off the experience\nfrom an neuro-biological\nreductionist standpoint,\nquite the opposite.\nIt's really beautiful to\nsee again this principle\nthat different experiences\nand the experience of pleasure\nfrom different things.\nSeeing your friends for the first time,\nsummer camp for a kid,\nwhatever it might happen to\nbe use the same currency,\ndopamine use the same currency serotonin.\nAnd this is a principle that I hope\nin listening to this podcast\nand even some of it's repetitive features\nfrom one episode to the next.\nI'm hoping that those will\nstart to embed in your mind\nthat the brain and body\nuse these common currencies\nfor different experiences.\nSo yes, if your dopamine and\nserotonin, or I should say\nif your dopamine and or\nserotonin levels are too low,\nit will be very hard to achieve pleasure\nto experience physical\npleasure or emotional pleasure\nof any kind.\nThat's why treatments of the sort\nthat I described a minute\nago might be right for you.\nObviously we can't determine\nif they're right for you.\nIt's also why they have side effects.\nIf you artificially\nincrease these molecules\nthey're associated with pleasure,\noftentimes you get a lack of motivation\nto go seek things like food.\nPeople don't get much\ninterest in food 'cause\nwhy should they if their\nserotonin levels are already up.\nAgain, there's a ton of\nindividual variation.\nI don't want to say that\nthese antidepressants\nare always bad.\nSometimes they've saved lives.\nThey've saved millions of lives.\nSometimes people have side effects\nthat make them not the right choice.\nSo it has to be determined\nfor the individual.\nThings like PEA or a more subtle effect.\nI should mention PEA\nsupplementation is something\nthat a number of people use\nbut it's very short-lived.\nBecause of the half-life of\nthis molecule was very brief,\nthe effect only lasts\nabout 20 minutes or so.\nThings like L-dopa, Mucuna pruriens\nlead to longer baseline\nincreases in dopamine.\nBut remember, any time\nyou raise a baseline,\nyou reduce the so-called signal to noise.\nWhat it means is if you're riding around\nat really high dopamine, at first,\neverything will start to seem exciting\nlike my niece and seeing her\nfriends for the first time.\nEverything's exciting.\nBut then what will happen\nis when your dopamine levels\nreturn to more normal levels,\nit will take a much\ngreater dopamine increase\nof much bigger event,\nmore novel, more exciting\nin order to achieve the sense that\nwhat you're experiencing is pleasureful.\nAnd this is because of the relationship\nbetween pleasure and pain.\nNow, in a future episode\nwe are going to go deep\ninto this relationship\nbetween pleasure and pain,\nbut just briefly as a precursor to that\nand because it's relevant\nto the conversation\nthat we've been having,\nyou might want to be\nwary of any experience,\nany experience, no matter how it arrives,\nchemical, physical, emotional,\nor some combination,\nyou might want to be wary\nof letting your dopamine go\ntoo high and certainly you want to be wary\nof it going too low.\nBecause of the way that\nthese circuits adjust.\nBasically every time that the\npleasure system is kicked in\nin high gear, an absolutely\nspectacular event,\nyou cannot be more ecstatic.\nThere is a mirror symmetric\nactivation of the pain system.\nAnd this might seem like\nan evil curse of biology,\nbut it's not.\nThis is actually a way to\nprotect this whole system\nof reward and motivation\nthat I talked about\nat the beginning of the episode.\nIt might sound great to\njust ingest substances\nor engage in behaviors\nwhere it's just dopamine,\ndopamine, dopamine,\nand just constantly be motivated,\nbut the system will eventually crash.\nAnd so what happens is when\nyou have a big increase\nin dopamine, you also\nwill get a big increase\nin the circuits that underlie\nour sense of disappointment\nand re adjusting the balance.\nAnd with repeated exposure\nto high levels of dopamine,\nnot naturally occurring wonderful events,\nbut really high chemically\ninduced peaks in dopamine,\nhigh magnitude, chemically\ninduced peaks in dopamine.\nWhat happens is those peaks in dopamine\nstart to go down and down and\ndown in response to the same,\nwhat ought to be incredible experience.\nWe start to what's called\nhabituate or attenuate,\nand yet the pain increases in size.\nAnd this has a preservative\nfunction in keeping us safe,\nbelieve it or not.\nBut what I just described\nis actually the basis\nof most if not all, forms of addiction\nsomething that we will deal with\nin a future episode in depth.\nSo what should you think about all?\nHow should you think about pleasure\nand how should you think about pain?\nWhat is too much pleasure?\nWell, that's going to differ\nfrom person to person,\nbut to the extent that one\ncan access pleasure repeatedly\nover time, ideally without\nchemical augmentation,\ncertainly not excessive\nchemical augmentation,\nthat means that this pleasure\nsystem is tuned up well\nand can continue to experience pleasure.\nHowever, if you find yourself engaging\nin the same behavior over and over again,\nbut achieving less and\nless pleasure from it,\nchances are you want to adjust down\nhow often you engage in that behavior.\nAnd or adjust down your\nexpectation of reward\nevery time you engage in that behavior.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, at the beginning of the episode\nI talked about how dopamine\nwill allow us to get\ninto bouts of hard work.\nWe will work very hard to pursue a reward,\nand that's really what dopamine does.\nAnd then when the reward comes\nthat doesn't increase our dopamine.\nIn fact, our dopamine levels go down.\nOne of the key things that we can all do\nto adjust our ability\nto experience pleasure\nis to engage in that\nintermittent reward schedule.\nYou can either adjust\ndown the peak in dopamine,\nmeaning not let yourself\never get too happy,\nbut that's no fun, right?\nLife is about occasionally achieving\nor experiencing ecstasy,\nbut every once in a\nwhile, remove the reward.\nAnd of course, I don't\nmean ecstasy the drug\nthat's a separate matter.\nThe MDMA trials are a separate matter.\nVery interesting, I want to be clear.\nI meant psychological and physical ecstasy\nof the natural sort.\nI've immense interest in what's\ngoing on in the MDMA trials,\nbut just for clarity purposes,\nthat's a separate topic that we will cover\nin an episode very soon.\nSo how do you adjust this dopamine system?\nWell, every once in a while at random,\nnot in a predictable way,\nyou remove the reward\nand that will keep you\nand your dopamine system\ntune up in the proper ways.\nThe gain of the dopamine\nsystem, as we say,\nwill be adjusted so that you can continue\nto experience dopamine and serotonin\nwhen you actually get the reward.\nThis can be translated into a huge number\nof different domains,\nbut I want to give some\nexamples because I'm sure\nthat many of you are asking,\nwait, what does this actually mean?\nOkay, let's say you're a student,\nor this could be a student in academia,\nor this could be a student\nof a physical practice.\nEvery once in a while when\nyou do something really well,\nmaybe that's even just\nshowing up to the practice\nrather than pat yourself on the back,\njust tell yourself\nyeah, that's the minimum\nthat's expected of me.\nWhen everyone's excited about\nsomething that you're doing,\nmaybe you're excited about it,\ntry and adjust down your\nexcitement a little bit.\nI know this might seem counterintuitive,\nbut you're preserving the\nability to experience excitement\nin a variety of contexts.\nLet's say you get a big monetary award.\nWell, that's great.\nI'm happy for you.\nAnd that's wonderful.\nHowever, you should be a little bit wary\nif you care about your dopamine system\nand you care about your ability\nto get subsequent monetary\nrewards, excuse me,\nawards rewards doesn't\nmatter which through effort,\nif you want to be able\nto maintain the ability\nto exert effort, well,\nthen you probably wouldn't\nwant to run out and\nimmediately buy something\nwith that monetary reward.\nIn other words, you\nwouldn't want to layer on\nmore dopamine release, okay?\nYou might, but you might not.\nYou might skip it.\nWhat you'll find then\nis that your motivation\nis essentially infinite.\nThis is what I described at\nthe beginning of the episode.\nAnd again, it's because\ndopamine is this currency.\nIt's like these days you\nhear a lot about Bitcoin,\nand Ethereum, and\nDogecoin, and USs dollars,\nand Euros and other stuff.\nBut the currency that you use in your body\ndoesn't matter what\nexternal currency those are.\nIn fact, as you watch the value\nof different currencies go up\nwhether or not it's cryptocurrency\nor standard currency,\nthe value is actually\nreflective of the dopamine\nthat exists inside of people.\nSo all the excitement\nabout a particular currency\ncrypto or otherwise is\nreally just dopamine.\nThat's the currency that we all use.\nAnd there's no negotiating that.\nThat's just the way that we're built.\nNow, to give yet other examples.\nLet's say you're teaching other\npeople how to do something\nand they do something exceptionally well.\nIf you reward them every single time.\nand in particular, if you\nreward them with something\nthat's even greater than the\nexperience of what they did.\nSo let's say kids win a soccer game\nand they're ecstatic.\nThey're jumping all over the place.\nThey're super excited and you reward them\nwith an even bigger\nexperience, a celebration,\nyou are actually inhibiting their ability\nto perform the same set of activities\nthat led them to the win if,\nand I really want to underscore\nif you reward them every time.\nOf course we should\nreward kids and each other\nand ourselves for our accomplishments,\nbut you don't want to do it every time.\nAnd sure there will be some disappointment\nfrom suddenly removing the\nreward that you expected,\nbut that's exactly the point.\nThat's what keeps these\ncircuits tuned up properly.\nNow there's the other form of pleasure,\nwhich is the more immediate visceral\nor sensory experience of pleasure.\nThis is distinct from goals\nand goal-directed behavior.\nI'm talking about the\nimmediate experience.\nThis is more of the serotonergic system.\nThere are other systems involved too,\nbut this is also the system\nthat draws out those endogenous opioids\nfrom a particular structure.\nWe have a structure in the\nback of our brain called PAG\nP-A-G, it's the periaqueductal gray area.\nVery interesting brain area\nthat is associated with pain,\nbut also with pleasure because\nunder certain conditions,\nit deploys endogenous opioids and gives us\na kind of blissed out feeling.\nThis is not like the opioids\nof the opioid epidemic sort\nthat people take and\nunfortunately have led\nto tremendous amounts\nof suffering and abuse.\nThese are endogenously released opioids.\nThese are the kinds of\nopioids that come out\nfrom long distance bouts of\nphysical exercise and running.\nThese are the opioids that are deployed\nin response to giving birth\nand overcoming the tremendous\npain of childbirth.\nSo PAG is very contextual\nand there are few types\nof stimuli or I should\nsay events in life...\nI'm really showing my nerdy side.\nThere are a few types of stimulate,\nI'm talking about experiences\nthat evoke endogenous opioid\nrelease from PAG.\nOne is sexual activity.\nSexual activity can\nincrease pain threshold.\nAnd here I am not suggesting\nor getting involved\nin anyone's particular proclivities\nor personal experiences.\nYou're welcome to editorialize\nthis however you like,\nhowever, what I'm talking\nabout are animal data\nand yes, human data as well,\nthat show that pain\nthresholds are increased\nanytime PAG is activated\nbecause of the release\nof these endogenous opioids.\nThere's also the immediate experience\nof whether or not a\nparticular form of touch\nis pleasureful or not.\nAnd there there's some\nvery interesting biology\nthat relates to really\nhow those little wires\nfrom those DRGs innovate our skin.\nWork studies I should say\ndone by David Ginty's lab\nat Harvard Medical School,\nthe Ginty lab has spent years working\non the somata sensory\nsystem, the touch system\nhas identified a particular\ncategory of neurons\nthat innervate the skin\nand then those neurons\nof course send that information\nup to the brain too.\nAnd they actually respond\nto direction of touch.\nNow, some of you might be more sensitive\nto this than others, but it turns out that\ncertain hairs like to be\ndeflected one way versus another.\nWhether you like cats or not,\nyou can do this experiment.\nYou can pet a cat in the\ndirection that they're fur lies.\nSo it lies down in a particular direction.\nYou'll notice that there's actually a gene\nthat dictates that the hairs lie down\nin a particular direction.\nAnd if you pet them in a way that's\nco-operating with that direction.\nSo not pushing the hairs up,\nbut rather stroking the\nhairs on the back of the cat.\nWell, you'll notice as\nthey often like that.\nNot all cats some cats are pretty grouchy,\nbut if you stroke their hair,\nthey will often per,\nthey'll often push into you.\nIf you were to stroke their\nhair in the opposite direction,\npushing the hairs up against the direction\nthat they want to lie down,\ncats do not like that.\nAnd it turns out that people\ndon't like that either.\nSome people do like to\nhave their hair pushed\nin a direction against the direction\nin which it wants to lay down.\nBut there is more typically response\na feeling like it's\npleasureful for instance,\nwhen someone brushes or combs their hair\nin the direction that\nit wants to lay down.\nAnd that's because the way\nin which these neurons,\nthey innovate these hairs\nsends information up\nto the brain bifurcates actually,\nit splits into brain centers\nthat evoke a sense of pleasure\nor a sense of not pleasure.\nIt's not necessarily pain.\nSo you might find that certain\npeople are very particular.\nThey like to be touched in a\ncertain way, but not others.\nYou might be one of those people.\nAnd areas of our skin\nthat have high density\nof receptors are very, very\nsensitive in a real way,\nin a real sense of the\nword to patterns of touch\nand whether or not a touch\nis too firm or too light.\nAnd that will be modulated\nby overall levels of arousal.\nAnd when I talk about arousal,\nwhat I'm talking about is how\nalert or how sleep we are.\nIt is impossible to experience pain\nwhen we are deep in sleep.\nI don't mean sleeping like\nof the typical night's sort.\nI mean, of the anesthesia sort.\nThat's the purpose of anesthesia\nto bring the brain and body\ninto a deep plane of\nrest, very deep in fact,\nand it's very hard if\nnot impossible to achieve\nor experience pleasure when\nwe are in a very low state\nof arousal as well.\nWhen we are in heightened\nstates of arousal,\nwe can achieve pain,\nwe can experience pain\nand we can experience pleasure.\nAnd under those heightened\nstates of arousal,\nwe are more sensitive.\nLiterally the passage\nof electrical signals\nfrom those locations on the body\nthat have heightened degrees\nor higher degrees, I should say\nof receptors, use your imagination.\nThey include the lips, the\nface, the feet, and the genitals\nand nearby areas, literally nearby areas.\nUnder conditions of higher\narousal two things happen,\nthe ability to achieve\nor experience pleasure\nat those locations goes up\nand our tolerance and our\nthreshold for pain also goes up.\nSo the principle here is that\nas our levels of arousal,\nthat foundation of\narousal goes up or down,\nso too goes up and down our ability\nto achieve pleasure and pain.\nAnd so these two extremes of\nbeing deep within anesthesia\nor another extreme as asleep\nor an heightened levels of arousal,\nour ability to achieve pleasure and pain\nare going to scale according to those.\nAnd this is why, and I'm\ncertainly not suggesting this,\nbut this is why some\npeople will take stimulants\nor drugs of abuse that increase arousal\nin order to achieve\npleasure of other kinds.\nThe problem is is that\nthose drugs in particular\nare things like cocaine and\nmethamphetamine and amphetamine\nbecome their own form of reinforcement\nso much so that the\nperson doesn't seek out\nany other form of excitement or arousal.\nSo today we weren't\ntalking about addiction.\nWe weren't necessarily\ntalking about motivation,\nbut we touched on those\ntopics as sort of a precursor\nof what's to come.\nWe talked about the pathways\nin the skin and in the brain\nand elsewhere in the body\nthat control our sense\nof pleasure and pain.\nWe described a number of\ndifferent tools ranging\nfrom hypnosis to different supplements,\nto electroacupuncture\nand various other tools\nthat one could use to modulate your sense\nof pleasure or pain.\nAnd of course, in thinking about pleasure,\nwe have to think about the dopamine system\nand the serotonin system\nand some of the related chemical systems.\nI realized that today's podcast\nhad a lot of scientific details.\nWe've timestamped everything for you\nso that you don't have to\ndigest it all at once of course\nI don't expect that everyone would be able\nto understand all these\ndetails all at once.\nWhat's more important\nreally is to understand\nthe general principles of how something\nlike pleasure and pain work.\nHow they interact, and\nthe very seldom systems\nwithin the brain and body\nthat allow them to occur\nand that modulator or change\ntheir ability to occur.\nAnd of course your subjective experience\nof pleasure or pain.\nSo I do hope that this was\non hole more pleasureful\nthan painful for you.\nIf you're enjoying this podcast\nand you're learning from it,\nand you'd like to support us,\nyou can do that in a\nnumber of
