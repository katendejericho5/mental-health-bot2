    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday I have the pleasure of introducing\nDr. Matthew Walker as our guest\non the Huberman Lab podcast.\nDr. Walker is a professor of\nneuroscience and psychology\nat the University of California, Berkeley.\nThere, his laboratory studies sleep.\nThey study why we sleep,\nwhat occurs during sleep, such\nas dreams and why we dream,\nlearning during sleep,\nas well as the consequences\nof getting insufficient\nor poor quality sleep on waking states.\nDr. Walker is also the author of\nthe international best\nselling book \"Why We Sleep\".\nOur discussion today is an\nabsolutely fascinating one\nfor anyone that's interested in sleep,\nlearning, or human\nperformance of any kind.\nDr. Walker teaches us how\nto get better at sleeping.\nHe also discusses naps,\nwhether or not we should\nor should not nap,\nwhether or not we can\ncompensate for lost sleep,\nand if so how to best do that.\nWe discuss behavioral protocols\nand interactions with light,\ntemperature, supplementation,\nfood, exercise, sex, all the\nvariables that can impact\nthis incredible state of mind\nand body that we call sleep.\nDuring my scientific career,\nI've read many papers about sleep\nand attended many seminars about sleep\nyet my discussion with Dr. Walker today\nrevealed to me more about\nsleep, sleep science\nand how to get better at sleeping\nthan all of those papers\nand seminars combined.\nI'm also delighted to share\nthat Dr. Walker has started a podcast.\nThat podcast entitled\n\"The Matt Walker Podcast\",\nreleases its first episode this month\nand is going to teach all about sleep,\nand how to get better at sleeping.\nSo be sure to check out\nthe Matt Walker podcast\non Apple, Spotify or wherever\nyou listen to podcasts.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to mention that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost of consumer information\nabout science and science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of the absolutely\nhighest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo all American swimmers from Stanford\nand everything about the\ndesign of their glasses\nis with performance in mind.\nI've spent my career\nstudying the visual system\nand how it works and I can\ntell you that ROKA glasses\ntake into account the\nscience of the visual system\nsuch that whether or\nnot you're wearing them\non a very bright day,\nor you walk into a shadowed\narea or there's cloud cover,\nyou can still see everything\nwith perfect clarity.\nThat also reflects the fact that\nthe lenses that they use\nare of the absolute\nhighest optical quality.\nThe other terrific thing about\nROKA sunglasses and eyeglasses\nis that they're designed to\nbe worn in all conditions.\nYou can use them while\nrunning, while cycling,\neven if you get sweaty,\nthey won't slip off.\nAnd they look great.\nOne problem I have with a lot of so called\nperformance eyeglasses\nand sunglasses out there\nis that they look crazy.\nThey make people look like cyborgs.\nROKA glasses have a terrific aesthetic,\nyou can wear them to dinner,\nyou can wear them at work,\nand you can wear them in all\nsorts of sports activities.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's ROKA roka.com\nand enter the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand then reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors that impact\nyour immediate and long term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd nowadays, with the\nadvent of DNA tests,\nyou can also get insight\ninto your immediate\nand long term health by way\nof understanding your DNA.\nOne issue with many DNA\nand blood tests, however,\nis that you get the numbers back\nabout metabolic factors,\nhormones, genes, et cetera,\nbut there's no directive\nas to what to do with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they have\na very easy to use dashboard,\nand that dashboard not only\ngives you your numbers,\nbut it gives you simple directives\nrelated to nutrition, supplementation,\nexercise and other lifestyle factors\nthat allow you to move those\nnumbers into the ranges\nthat are right for you\nand your health goals.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/Huberman\nand if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans,\njust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Belcampo,\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass fed\nand finished certified humane meats.\nI don't eat a lot of meat,\nI eat meat about once a day,\nbut when I do, I make sure\nthat it's high quality\nand both humanely and sustainably raised.\nConventionally raised animals\nare confined to feedlots\nand eat a diet of inflammatory grains,\nbut Belcampo's animals\ngraze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses,\nresulting in meat that's\nhigher in nutrients\nand healthy fats.\nNow, I've talked many times\nbefore on this podcast\nabout how getting sufficient\nlevels of omega threes\nis very important for metabolic\nhealth, hormone health,\nmood, essentially all\naspects of one's health.\nBelcampo meats have high\nlevels of omega threes,\nbecause of the grasses they feed on.\nThe way Belcampo raises its animals\nisn't just better for our health,\nit also has a positive\nimpact on the environment.\nThey practice regenerative agriculture,\nwhich means that their\nmeat is climate positive\nand carbon negative,\nmeaning it's good for you,\nand it's good for the environment.\nYou can order Belcampo's\nsustainably raised meats\nto be delivered to you\nusing my code Huberman\nby going to belcampo.com/Huberman\nand if you do that, you'll\nget 20% off your first order.\nI'm a big fan of their keto meatballs\nI also really liked\ntheir boneless rib eyes,\nI eat those pretty much once a day.\nAgain, that's Huberman for the code.\nAnd it's belcampo.com/huberman\nfor 20% off your order.\nAnd now my discussion\nwith Dr. Matt Walker.\nGreat to finally meet you in person.\n- Wonderful to connect.\nI mean, it's been too long,\nbut I suspect it would\nhave been a shorter time\nbefore we'd met lest the\npandemic, thank you for coming up.\n- No, thank you, yeah,\nI'm delighted that we're finally\nsitting down face to face.\nI've been tracking your work\nboth in the internet sphere,\nand I read your book and loved it.\nAnd also from the perspective of science,\nyou actually came to\nStanford couple of years ago\nand gave a lecture for BrainMind.\n- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- And there, of course,\nyou talked about sleep\nand its utility and its challenges\nand how to conquer it, so to speak.\nLet's start off very basic, what is sleep?\n- Sleep is probably the\nsingle most effective thing\nyou can do to reset your\nbrain and body health.\nSo that's a functional\nanswer in terms of, you know,\nwhat is sleep in terms of its benefits.\nSleep as a process though,\nis an incredibly complex\nphysiological ballet.\nAnd if you were to recognize\nor see what happens to your brain\nand your body at night, during sleep,\nyou would be blown away.\nAnd the paradox is that most of us,\nand I would think this too, you know,\nif I wasn't a sleep scientist,\nwe go to bed, we lose consciousness\nfor seven to nine hours,\nand then we sort of\nwake up in the morning,\nand we generally feel better.\nAnd in some ways that denies\nthe physiological and\nbiological beauty of sleep.\nSo upstairs in your brain,\nwhen you're going through these\ndifferent stages of sleep,\nthe changes in brainwave activity\nare far more dramatic\nthan those that we see\nwhen we're awake.\nAnd we can speak about deep\nsleep and what happens there,\nREM sleep is a fascinating time,\nwhich is another stage of sleep,\noften called dream sleep,\nwhich is rapid eye movement sleep,\nthat stage of sleep\nsome parts of your brain\nare up to 30%, more active\nthan when you're awake.\nSo again, it's kind of violating this idea\nthat our mind is dormant.\nAnd our body is just simply\nquiescent and resting.\nSo I would happy to just\nsort of double click\non either one of those,\nand also what changes in the body as well.\nBut it is an intense\nevolutionary adaptive benefit and system.\nThat said, though,\nI would almost push back\nagainst an evolved system\nwhen we think about the question\nof sleep and what sleep is.\nOur assumption has always\nbeen that we evolved to sleep.\nAnd I've actually questioned that\nand I have no way to get in a time capsule\nand go back and prove this,\nbut what if we started off sleeping,\nand it was from sleep,\nthat wakefulness emerged?\nWhy do we assume that\nit's the other way around?\nAnd I think there's probably\nsome really good evidence\nthat sleep may have been the proto state,\nthat it was the basic\nfundamental living state.\nAnd when we became awake, as it were,\nwe always had to return to sleep.\nYou know, in some ways, at that point,\nsleep was the price that\nwe paid for wakefulness.\nAnd that's another way of\ndescribing what sleep is.\nBut again, I think it sort of denies\nthat the active state of sleep,\nit's not a passive state of sleep either.\nAnd then finally, you can say\nwhat is sleep across different species?\nAnd in us human beings,\nand in all mammalian species\nand avian species as well,\nsleep is broadly separated\ninto these two main types.\nAnd we've got non rapid eye\nmovement sleep on the one hand,\nand then we've got rapid eye\nmovement sleep on the other.\nAnd we can speak about how they unfold\nacross a night and their architecture\nbecause it's not just\nintellectually interesting\nfrom the perspective of what sleep is,\nit's also practically\nimpactful for our daily lives.\nAnd I'd love to sort of\ngo down that route too.\nBut you navigate, you tell me I can.\n- No, no, let's definitely\ngo down that route.\nSo you mentioned how active the brain is,\nduring certain phases of sleep.\nWhen I was coming up in science,\nREM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep\nwas referred to as paradoxical sleep,\nis that still a good\nway to think about it?\nParadoxical because\nthe brain is so active,\nand yet we are essentially\nparalyzed, correct?\n- Yeah, it really is a paradox.\nAnd where that came from\nwas simply the brainwave recordings,\nthat if all I'm measuring about you,\nis your brainwave activity,\nit's very difficult for me\nsitting outside of the\nsleep laboratory room\nto figure out, are you awake,\nor are you in REM sleep?\nBecause those two\npatterns of brain activity\nare so close to one another,\nyou can't discriminate between them.\nYet, the paradox is\nthat when you are awake,\nI go in there and you're\nsort of sitting up,\nyou're clearly conscious and awake.\nBut yet, when you go into REM sleep,\nyou are completely paralyzed.\nAnd that's one of the I think\nthat's part of the paradox.\nBut the paradox really just comes down to\ntwo dramatically different\nconscious states.\nYet, brain activity is dramatically\nmore similar than different.\nAnd the way I can figure out\nwhich of the two you are in\nis by measuring two other signals,\nthe activity from your eyes\nand the activity from your muscles.\nSo when we're awake,\nwe will occasionally have these blinks,\nand we'll have sort of seek heads.\nBut during REM sleep,\nyou have these really bizarre,\nhorizontal shuttling eye\nmovements that occur.\nAnd that's where the name comes from\nrapid eye movements.\n- Are they always horizontal?\n- Mostly, they are horizontal.\n- That's interesting.\n- And that's one of the ways\nthat we can differentiate them\nfrom other waking eye movement activity,\n'cause it's not always like\nit can be sometimes horizontal,\nbut can also have diagonal and\nalso vertical in that plane.\nBut then the muscle activity\nis the real dead giveaway,\njust before you enter REM sleep,\nyour brainstem, which\nis where the dynamics of\nnon REM and REM are essentially played out\nand then expressed upstairs in the cortex\nand downstairs in the body,\nwhen we go into REM sleep,\nand just a few seconds\nbefore that happens,\nthe brainstem sends a signal\nall the way down the spinal cord.\nAnd it communicates with what are called\nthe alpha motor neurons in the spinal cord\nwhich control the\nvoluntary skeletal muscles.\nAnd it's a signal of paralysis.\nAnd when you go into dream sleep,\nyou are locked into a\nphysical incarceration\nof your own body.\n- Amazing.\n- You know, why would Mother\nNature do such a thing?\nAnd it's in some ways very simple.\nThe brain paralyzes the body\nso that the mind can dream safely.\nBecause think about how quickly\nwe would have all been\npopped out of the gene pool.\nYou know, if I think I'm, you know,\none of the best skydivers\nwho can just simply fly,\nand I've had some times\nthose dreams, too, you know,\nand I get up on my apartment\nwindow, and I leap out.\n- You're done.\n- You're done, you know.\nSo that's one of the sort of\nthat's part of the paradox of REM sleep,\nboth it's brain activity similarity,\ndespite the behavioral\nstate being so different\nand this bizarre lockdown\nof the sort of brain\nof the body itself.\nNow, of course, the involuntary muscles\nthankfully aren't paralyzed.\nSo you keep breathing,\nyour heart keeps beating.\n- Is this why men have\nerections during REM sleep,\nand women have vaginal\nlubrication during sleep?\n- That's one of the reasons\npart of the other reason though there\nis because of the autonomic activity.\nSo there is a nervous,\na part of our nervous system\ncalled the autonomic nervous system,\nand it controls many of\nthe automatic behaviors.\nAnd some of those are aspects\nof our reproductive facilities.\nDuring REM sleep, what we later discovered\nis that you go through these bizarre\nwhat we call autonomic\nstorms, which sounds dramatic,\nbut it actually is when you measure them.\nThat you'll go through periods\nwhere your heart rate,\ndecelerates and drops\nand your blood pressure goes down\nand then utterly randomly,\nyour heart rate accelerates dramatically,\nand what we call the\nfight or flight branch\nof the autonomic nervous system\nor the sympathetic nervous system,\nbadly named 'cause it's\nanything but sympathetic,\nit's very aggravating,\nthat all of a sudden fires up\nand then it shuts down again.\nAnd it's not in any regular way.\nAnd it's when you get\nthose autonomic storms,\nyou get very activated from\na physiologic perspective\nthat you can have these erections\nand you have vaginal discharge et cetera.\n- But you're totally paralyzed?\n- But you are still paralyzed.\nThere are only two voluntary muscle groups\nthat are speared from\nthe paralysis, bizarre.\nOne, your extra ocular muscles,\nbecause if they were paralyzed,\nyou wouldn't be able to\nhave rapid eye movements.\nAnd the other that we later discovered\nwas the inner ear muscle.\nAnd we've got no good understanding\nas to why those two muscles groups\nare speared from the paralysis.\nIt may have something\nto do with cranial nerve\nbut I don't think it's that,\nI think it's perhaps something\nmore sensory related.\nSome people have argued\nthat the reason the eyeballs\nare speared from the paralysis\nis because if your eyeballs are left\nfor long periods of time, inactive,\nyou may get things such\nas oxygen sort of issues\nin the aqueous or vitreous humor.\nAnd so the eyeballs have to keep draining.\n- The drainage systems of the anterior eye\nare made to require movement.\n- Exactly.\n- People with glaucoma\nhave deficits in drainage\nthrough the anterior chamber,\nbut there I'm speculating.\nI'm also speculating, when I ask this,\nI would imagine that\nthere are states in waking\nthat also resemble slow wave sleep,\nor rather that there are states\nthat slow wave sleep also\nresembles waking states.\nYou've beautifully\nillustrated how REM sleep\ncan mimic some of the\nmore active brain states\nthat we achieve in waking.\nWhat sort of waking state\nthat I might have experienced\nor experience on a daily basis\nmight look similar to slow wave sleep,\nnon REM sleep, if any?\n- It's a genius way of thinking about it\nturns the tables I love it.\nWe almost never see anything\nlike the true ultra slow waves\nof deep non REM sleep.\nSo we spoke about these\ntwo stages non REM and REM.\nNon REM is further subdivided\ninto four separate stages,\nstages, one through four,\nincreasing in their depth of sleep.\nSo stages three and four\nthat's what we typically call\ndeep non REM sleep.\nStages one and two light non REM.\n- So maybe take me\nthrough the arc of a night\njust so that.\nSo I put my head down,\nwell, for you, what time do\nyou normally go to sleep?\n- So I'm usually sort of\naround about 10:30pm guy.\nAnd usually I'll naturally wake up\nsort of a little bit before 7:00,\nsometimes before 6:45 or 7:00,\nI have an alarm set for 7:04am.\n- You heard it here, folks\nMatt Walker does use an alarm clock.\n- I rarely, rarely I'm usually sort of.\n- He doesn't recommend\nit, but he does use it.\n- Yeah, I usually.\n- You're human after all.\n- Oh, I am so human.\nAnd I've had my sleep issues\nand I'd love to speak about that too.\nBut it's only just, you know,\nin the event that, you know,\n'cause I like to keep regularity too.\nYou've got to keep those\ntwo things in balance.\nAnd 7:04 just because, you\nknow, why not be idiosyncratic.\nI don't know why we always set things\non these hot numbers.\nSo yep so when you.\n- So you go to sleep around 10:30,\nso using you as an example,\nbecause I imagine a number of people\ngo to sleep at different times.\nBut 10:30 is about when I\ngo to sleep, 11 is for me.\nBut so you go to sleep at 10:30,\nso for that first, let's\nsay three hours of sleep,\nwhat does the architecture\nof that sleep look like\nas compared to the last three hours\nof your sleep before morning?\n- Yeah, so I should note\nthat that sort of, you know,\n10:30 to 7:00 that's just\nbased on my chronotype\nand my preferential it's\ndifferent for different people.\nI'm not suggesting that\nthat's the perfect sweet spot\nfor humanity's sleep.\nIt's just my natural sweet spot.\n- But I imagine most\npeople probably go to sleep\nsomewhere between 10pm and midnight.\n- It's somewhere between 9 and midnight.\n- And most probably wake\nup between 5am and 7am\nor 5:30 and 7:30.\n- Yeah, yeah at least in\nif you look at sort of\nfirst world nations,\nthat's a typical sleep profile.\nSo when I first fall asleep,\nI'll go into the light\nstages of non REM sleep\nstages one and two of non REM.\nAnd then I'll start to descend down\ninto the deeper stages of non REM sleep.\nSo after about maybe 20 minutes,\nI'm starting to head down\ninto stage three non REM\nand then into stage four non REM sleep.\nAnd as I'm starting to fall asleep,\nas I've cast off from the usually with me,\nmurky waters of wakefulness,\nand I'm in the shallows of\nsleep stages one and two,\nmy heart rate starts to drop a little bit.\nAnd then my brainwave pattern\nactivity starts to slow down.\nNormally when I'm awake,\nit's going up and down,\nmaybe 20, 30, 40, 50 times a second.\nAs I'm going into light, non REM sleep,\nit will slow down to maybe 15, 20\nand then really starts to slow down\ndown to about sort of 10\nor eight cycles per second,\neight cycle waves per second.\nThen as I'm starting to move into\nstages three and four, non REM sleep,\nseveral remarkable things happen.\nAll of a sudden, my heart rate\nreally does start to drop.\nOh, and I'll come back to temperature,\nI'm going to write temperature down\n'cause I always forget these things.\nNow I'm solidly in the\nfoothills of middle age.\nSo as I'm starting to go\ninto those deeper stages\nof non REM sleep, all of a sudden,\nhundreds of thousands\nof cells in my cortex\nall decide to fire together\nand then they all go silent together.\nAnd it's this remarkable\nphysiological coordination\nof the likes that we just don't see\nat during any other brain state.\n- That's really interesting,\nother than recordings\nfrom the brains of animals\nand a little bit from humans,\nI don't think I've ever\nseen the entire cortex\nor even entire regions of\ncortex light up like that.\n- Yeah, it's stunning.\nIt's almost like this\nbeautiful sort of mantra chant,\nor this sort of, you\nknow, it's a slow inhale\nand then a meditative\nexhale, inhale, exhale.\nAnd these waves are just\nenormous in their size.\n- And the body is capable\nof movement at this time,\nthere is no paralysis.\n- There is no paralysis,\nbut for the most part,\nmuscle tone has also\ndropped significantly.\n- Interesting.\n- At that point.\nAnd then you will,\nor I will then stay there\nfor about another 20 or 30 minutes.\nSo now I'm maybe 60, or 70 minutes\ninto my first sleep cycle.\nAnd then I'll start to rise back up,\nback up into stage two non REM sleep.\nAnd then after about 80 or so minutes,\nI'll pop up, and I'll have\na short REM sleep period,\nand then back down, I go\nagain, down into non REM,\nup into REM.\nAnd you do that reliably, repeatedly,\nand I will be doing that, and\nI do do that every 90 minutes.\nAt least that's the\naverage for most adults,\nit's different in different species.\nWhat changes to your question\nis the ratio of non REM to REM\nwithin that 90 minute cycle\nas you move across the night.\nAnd what I mean by this is,\nin the first half of the night,\nthe majority of those 90 minute cycles\nare comprised of a lot\nof deep non REM sleep,\nthat's when I get my stage three and four\nof deep non REM sleep.\nOnce I push through to the\nsecond half of the night,\nnow that seesaw balance changes.\nAnd instead, the majority\nof those 90 minute cycles\nare comprised either of this lighter form\nof non REM sleep, stage two non REM sleep,\nand much more and increasingly more\nrapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd the implication that\nI was sort of speaking\nabout pragmatically is,\nlet's say that I have to,\nand I usually never do early\nmorning flights or red eyes,\njust because I'm a mess if that happens,\nI'm not suggesting other people shouldn't.\n- I'm suggesting people not not do that.\nEvery time I've taken a\nred eye or I've done that\ntwo or three days later,\nI get some sort of general\nfeeling of malaise,\nmy brain doesn't work as well,\nI think red eyes should be abolished.\nFor the pilots too I mean, and for the.\n- And we can speak about\nthose, there's data.\n- And for the emergency room, I mean,\nlong shifts have been\nshown to lead to, you know,\nphysician induced errors that\nlead to a lot of fatalities.\nI mean, there are a lot of\nreasons why staying up too long,\nor being up at the wrong times,\nif you're not adapted\nto it is just terrible.\n- You have the data and all\nof those cases, you know,\nparticularly physicians too\nthere was some recent data\nlooking at suicidality.\nAnd the rates of suicide\nin training physicians\nare, you know, far, far above the norm.\nAnd I don't suspect that, you know,\nthe schedules are helping them\nI suspect that sleep is a missing part\nof that explanatory equation, but.\n- I teach medical students\nand they they're phenomenal,\nbut yeah, they're under\nextremely challenged conditions.\n- We shouldn't put them\nunder those conditions.\n- [Andrew] No, it's not optimizing\nperformance, I have one.\n- But sorry, I was sorry.\n- No, no, this is important.\nThese it's an important digression.\nI have one question,\nwhich is you're saying\nthat as across the night,\na greater percentage of\nthese 90 minute cycles\nare going to be occupied by REM sleep\nas you progress through the night.\nI'm aware that, based\non work that you've done\nand from your public\neducation efforts and others\nthat we have so called circadian forces,\nand we have other forces that are driving\nwhen we sleep and when we\nwant to sleep, etcetera.\nWithout going into the details of those,\nI've a simple question,\nthe experiment is the following.\nLet's say, God forbid,\nyou are prevented from going\nto sleep at your normal time\nand you stay up for the\nfour hours or five hours\nthat normally you would be in\npredominantly slow wave sleep.\n- If let's say you finally\nget to lie down at 3am\na time when normally your\nsleep would be occupied\nmostly by rapid eye movement sleep,\nwill you experience a greater percentage\nof rapid eye movement sleep\nbecause of these so\ncalled circadian forces,\nmeaning that's what's\nappropriate for that time?\nOr will your system need to start\nat the beginning of the race that were,\nas I'm referring to it,\nthat we're calling sleep?\nAnd for if that's not clear to anybody,\nbasically, what I'm asking is,\nif you are forced to skip\nthe slow wave sleep part of the night,\nwill your system leap into\nrapid eye movement sleep?\nOr does it have to start at the beginning\nand get slow wave sleep first?\nIn other words, does one sleep state\ndrive the entry to the next sleep state?\n- Great question, so there\nis some degree of reciprocity\nbetween the sleep states I should note\nthat when we drive one of those up,\nwe often but not always\nsee a change in the other.\nThere are some pharmacologies\nthat have shown\nan independence to that.\nAnd we've also played around\nwith things like temperature,\nand sometimes you can, you know,\nnudge one and not seem to\nupset or perturb the other.\nBut to your, I think, lovely point,\nthe answer is, it's a mix,\nbut it's mostly the latter.\nMeaning you will mostly go\ninto your REM sleep phases,\nand be significantly\ndeficient in your deep sleep.\nSo just because I start\nmy sleep cycle at 3am,\nrather than at 10:30pm,\nit doesn't mean that my brain just says,\nwell, I've got a program,\nand I'm just going to run the program,\nand the way the program runs\nis that we always start with\na first couple of hours of deep sleep.\nSo we're just going to begin\nact number one, scene one,\nit doesn't do that.\nNow, I will get some\ndeep sleep to begin with\nand part of that is just\nbecause of how sleep works.\nBased on how long I've been awake,\nlonger I'm awake,\nthere is a significantly\ngreater pressure for deep sleep.\nBut we actually use exactly\nwhat you just described\nas an experimental technique\nto selectively deprive people\nof one of those stages\nof sleep or the other.\nSo we will do first half\nof the night deprivation,\nand then let you sleep the second half.\nSo that means that you will\nbe mostly deep sleep deprived,\nand you will still get\nmostly all of your REM sleep.\nAnd then we switch it,\nso you only get your first four hours,\nwhich means you will mostly\nget deep non REM sleep,\nbut you will get almost no REM sleep.\nSo in both of those groups,\nthey've both had four hours of sleep.\nSo the difference between them\nin terms of an experimental outcome\nis not the sleep time\nbecause they both slept\nfor the same amount.\nIt's the contribution of\nthose different stages.\nNow, we actually have more elegant methods\nfor sort of selectively going in there\nand scooping out\ndifferent stages of sleep.\nBut that's the way we\nused to do it old school\nwas just using this timing difference.\n- And who suffers more?\nThose that lack the early phase,\nand were those that lack the\nlater phase of the night sleep?\nIn other words,\nif I have to sleep only four\nhours for whatever reason,\nam I better off getting the\nearly part of the night's sleep\nor the second half of the night sleep?\n- Depends on what the outcome measure is.\n- So that gets right to the differences\nbetween slow wave sleep and REM.\n- Right.\n- I was probably misinformed.\nBut my understanding a\nvery crude understanding\nI should say before.\n- I very much doubt I'll\ncontrary with someone like you.\n- Which is that's very nice of you.\nThe first part of the night\nthe slow wave sleep is\nrestorative to the musculature\nto motor learning, and\nthat the dream content\ntends to be less emotional.\nThe second half of the night,\nbeing more emotional dreams\nand sort of the unpairing\nof the emotional load\nof our previous day and other experiences.\nSo in other words,\nif I were to deprive\nmyself, excuse me of REM,\nI would be hyper emotional,\nnot maybe not as settled\nwith the kind of experiences of my life.\nWhereas if I deprive\nmyself of slow wave sleep,\nI would feel a more physical malaise.\nIs that correct?\nOr is that far too simple?\nAnd if it is too simple,\nplease tell me where I'm wrong?\n- No, I think much of that is correct.\nAnd it's sort of that plus.\nSo for example, during deep non REM sleep,\nthat's where we get this.\nIt's almost a form of natural\nblood pressure medication.\nAnd so when I take that\naway from you, the next day,\nwe're usually going to\nsee autonomic dysfunction,\nwe're usually going to see abnormalities\nin heart rate blood pressure.\nWe also know that during\ndeep non REM sleep,\nthat there is a certain\ncontrol of specific hormones.\nFor example, we know that\nthe insulin regulation\nof sort of metabolism,\nmeaning how will you look\nfrom a regulated blood sugar perspective\nversus dysregulated, pre\ndiabetic look of profile.\nThat's where deep sleep seems to matter\nif we selectively deprive\nyou of that we can see.\n- Growth hormone.\n- Growth hormone\nis different actually.\nSo that's a beautiful demonstration\nwhere growth hormone seems to\nbe more REM sleep dependent.\nAnd that's why we can come\non to the effects of alcohol\nand there's some really impressive\nfrightening data on alcohol\nand it's disruption of sleep.\nBut then we also know testosterone,\npeak levels of testosterone\nhappen during REM sleep.\n- So the second half of\nthe night, essentially.\n- Which is the second half of the night.\nSo it really just means that the,\nyour profile of mental\nand physical dysfunction\nwill be different under\nboth of those conditions.\nWhich one would you prefer?\nI would prefer neither of them.\nAnd it really depends on what\nyou're trying to optimize for.\nSo it's just so complicated,\nsleep is just so pluripotent, you know,\nit's so physiologically systemic,\nthat it's almost impossible\nnot to undergo one of those two things,\njust deep sleep deprivation,\nor just REM sleep deprivation,\nand not show a profile\nthat you would really prefer to avoid.\nAnd that's the reason from\nan evolutionary standpoint,\nthat we've preserved\nthose stages of sleep.\nI mean, sleep is just\nso idiotic, you know,\nfrom an evolutionary perspective.\n- Or maybe waking is idiotic.\n- Or waking is, you know, well, yeah.\n- Based on your previous idea.\n- Who've you been talking to?\nI think that comment\nis very specific to me.\nYeah, I am normally always\nan idiot when working.\nBut I think this idea\nthat sleep, you know,\nis so profoundly detrimental to us,\nif you were to take it\nat face value, you know,\nyou're not finding a mate,\nyou're not reproducing,\nyou're not foraging for food,\nyou're not caring for you're young\nand worst of all, you're\nvulnerable to predation,\non any one of those grounds\nsleep probably should have\nbeen selected against.\nBut it wasn't sleep has fought\nits way through heroically\nevery step along the evolutionary path.\nAnd therefore, every sleep\nstage has also survived\nas best we can tell.\nWhat that means is that\nthose are non negotiable.\nIf mother nature had found a way\nto even just sort of, you know,\nthin slice some of that sleep from us,\nthere would have been vast,\nI'm sure evolutionary benefits,\nbut looks as though she hasn't.\nAnd I'm usually in favor of her wisdom\nafter 3.6 million years, so.\n- Yeah, it's incredible.\nI want to introduce a\nanother Gedankenexperiment,\nother thought experiment.\nSo in this arc of the night,\nslow wave sleep predominates\nearly in the night,\nand then REM sleep.\nThere's a scenario that many people\nincluding myself experience\non a regular basis.\nWhich is they go to\nsleep, sleeping just fine,\nthree, four hours into it, they wake up.\nThey wake up, for whatever\nreason, maybe there was a noise,\nmaybe the temperature isn't right,\nwe will certainly talk about\nsleep hygiene, etcetera.\nThey get up, they go to the restroom,\nthey might flip on the\nlights, they might not,\nthey'll get back in bed\nhopefully they're not\npicking up their phone\nand starting to browse\nand wake up the brain\nthrough various mechanisms\nlight and cognitive stimulation, etcetera.\nThey go back to sleep, let's\nsay after about 10, 15 minutes,\nthey're able to fall back asleep.\nAnd then they sleep till\ntheir more typical wake time.\nHow detrimental is that wake up episode\nor event in terms of\nlongevity, learning, et cetera?\nI would love to sleep the entire\nnight through every night,\nbut most nights I don't.\nAnd yet, I feel pretty\ngood throughout the day,\nsome days better than others.\nSo if you were to kind of\nevaluate that waking episode,\nand compare it to sleeping\nthe whole night through,\nwhat are your your thoughts on that?\n- So I think if you're waking up\nsort of frequently, as you're describing,\nI would probably get your estate in order\nbecause my guess is within the next year,\nyou're going to be you're\ngoing to be done for,\nno I'm kidding you.\nAbsolutely kidding you.\nIt is perfectly natural and normal,\nparticularly as we progress\nwith age, you know,\nchildren tend to have typically\nmore continuous sleep.\nNow it's not that they aren't waking up\nfor brief periods of time they are\nand in fact, we all do.\nWhen we come out the other\nend of our sleep cycle\nat the end of our REM sleep\nperiod of the 90 minute cycle,\nalmost everybody wakes up\nand we make a postural\nmovement, we turn over\nbecause we've been paralyzed for so long\nand the body will also like to shift\nit's weight or position.\n- Do we ever look around?\nEver open our eyes and look around?\n- You, sometimes people\nwill open their eyes,\nbut usually it's only for\na brief period of time\nand they usually never commit\nthose awakenings to memory.\nYour situation and it's\nmy situation as well,\nI usually now at this stage of life,\nI don't sleep through the night.\nI'll usually have a bathroom\nbreak and then I'll come back.\nThat's perfectly normal.\nWe tend to forget that in sleep science,\nwe think of sleep efficiency\nso of the total amount of\ntime that you're in bed,\nhow much of that percent\ntime is spent asleep?\nAnd we usually look to\nnumbers that are above 85%,\nor more as a healthy sleep efficiency.\nSo if you're to think about\nme going to bed and I spend, you know,\nlet's say, eight and a quarter,\neight and a half hours of time in bed,\nwith a normal, healthy sleep efficiency,\nI still may be only sleeping a total\nof seven and a half hours,\nor seven and three quarter hours.\nMeaning that I'm going\nto be awake in total,\nnot in one long about,\nbut I'm going to be awake\nfor upwards of 30 minutes,\nnet some time.\nSometimes that can be after\na 10 minute, you know,\ndalliance after having\ngone to the bathroom,\nand I'm just gradually\ndrifting back off again.\nOther times, it will just\nbe for a couple of minutes.\nAnd most of those you don't commit.\nSo I think we need to stop,\nwe don't need to get too\nworried about, you know,\nperiods of time awake,\njust because we're not\nsleeping throughout the night.\nI would love to do that, too.\nAnd I remember when that used to happen,\nand it still happens occasionally.\n- Every once in a while, it\nfeels great when it does happen.\n- And it's a lovely thing.\n- It's a surprise right?\nLike oh my goodness I slept\nthrough the whole night.\n- It is now a surprise,\nyeah it is a surprise.\nBut for the most part,\nI think we can be more relaxed about that\nwhere we have to be a bit\nmore attentive, though,\nis if you're spending\nlong periods of time,\nnot being able to get back to sleep.\nAnd usually we define that by saying,\nif it's been 20, 25 minutes,\nnormally, that's the time\nwhen we would really say okay,\nlet's explore this, what's going on?\nLet's see what's happening.\nThe other thing is if it's\nhappening very frequently,\nso even if you're, you know,\nnot awake for 25 minutes stretches,\nbut you're finding yourself waking up\nand being consciously\naware that you've woken up\nfor maybe six, seven or eight\ntimes throughout the night\nand your sleep is very\nwhat we call fragmented\nthe great science of sleep\nin the past five or 10 years\nhas been yes, quantity is important,\nbut quality is just as important.\nAnd you can't have one without the other\nin terms of a good\nbeneficial next day outcome.\nYou can't just get four hours of sleep,\nbut brilliant quality of\nsleep and be unimpaired.\nNor can you get eight hours of sleep,\nbut have very poor quality of sleep\nand be unimpaired the next day.\nSo that's why I just\nsort of want to asterisk,\nthis idea of let's not get too worried\nabout waking up and\nhaving some time awake,\nthat's perfectly normal and natural.\nBut if it's happening very\nfrequently throughout the night,\nor those periods of time,\nor long stretches of time,\nupwards of 25 minutes,\nthen let's look into it.\n- Well, I can assure you\njust helped a lot of people\nfeel better about this waking up episode\nthat I and many other people experience.\n- I hope so 'cause I think\nit's really important\nthat we, you know,\nI think I've been desperately\nguilty of perhaps, you know,\nearly on being too\npuritanical about, you know,\nsleep and I've retrospected,\nand I've tried to explore why\nthis was the case, you know,\nit was almost sleep or\nelse, dot, dot, dot.\nAnd at the time when I was\nstarting to write the book,\nwhich was back in 2016, you know,\nsleep was still a neglected stepsister\nin the health conversation of today.\nAnd I could see all of the,\n- That has certainly changed.\n- And it's changing, you know,\nand not because it's my efforts,\nbut because of all of my colleagues.\n- I would say, well,\nit's great that you give attribution\nto the other people involved.\nAnd of course, it's a big field.\nBut I think you've done a\ngreat service by cueing people\nto the importance of this state,\nnot just for avoiding\ntroublesome outcomes,\nbut also for optimizing\ntheir waking state.\nIt's really, you know,\nI view sleep as this\nperiod that feels good,\nbut we're not aware of how it feels\nwhen we're in it necessarily.\nIt has tremendous benefits\nwhen you're doing it well,\nso to speak,\nand it has tremendous\ndeficits when we're not.\nAnd I think it was an\nimportant thing for you to do\nto cue people to this issue.\nAnd I would say mission accomplished,\nthat people are aware\nof the need for sleep.\nI think that knowing that waking up\nin the middle of the night is normal,\nprovided it's not too frequent is great\nand will also help people\nwho may have been overly\nconcerned about that.\nI do want to use this as an opportunity\nto raise something about the\nso called Uberman schedule\nnot to be confused with\nthe Huberman schedule.\nFortunately, no one\nhas confused those yet.\nSome years ago, there\nwas a discussion about\nthe so called Uberman schedule,\nmeaning the Superman schedule.\nSo that's Huberman without an H,\nwhich I have nothing to do with.\nIf you read your Nietzsche\nthis will have a subtext.\nBut regardless, the Uberman\nschedule, as I understand\nis one in which the person elects to sleep\nin 90 minute, bouts spread\nthroughout the day and night,\nin an attempt to get more productivity\nand or reduce their overall sleep need.\nThere was a paper published recently\nthat explored whether or not\nthis is good or bad for us.\nMaybe you just give us the\ntake home message on that.\n- Yes, so these Uberman like schedules\nand there's lots of\ndifferent forms of that,\nthey tried to essentially\npie chart the 24 hour period,\ninto short bouts of sleep\nwith some shorter or no, well,\nslightly longer periods of wakefulness,\nthen short bouts of\nsleep then wakefulness.\nYou know, you're, I sort\nof made it, I think a quip,\nit's almost like you're\nsleeping like a baby, you know,\n'cause that's the way\nthat babies will sleep.\n- In 90 minute naps.\n- That they will have, you\nknow, these brief naps,\nthen they're awake, then they're asleep\nthen they're awake.\nAnd to the chagrin of\nparents across the night,\nit's basically the same,\nthey're awake, they're asleep,\nthey're awake, they're asleep.\nAnd that's more the schedule\nthat these types of\nprotocols have suggested.\nAnd there was a really\ngreat comprehensive review\nthat found not only that they\nweren't necessarily helpful,\nbut they were actually\nreally quite detrimental.\nAnd on almost every performance metric,\nwhether it be task performance,\nwhether it be physiological\noutcome measures,\nwhether it even be the\nquality of the sleep\nthat they were having,\nwhen they were trying to get it,\nall of those were in a downward direction.\nAnd it's not surprising\nif you look at your\nthe way that your\nphysiology is programmed,\nif you look at the way your\ncircadian rhythm is programmed,\nnone of that screams to us\nthat we should be sleeping in that way.\n- Well, I'm chuckling because\nwe always hear sleep like a baby.\nThis is how babies sleep.\nAnd I would say don't sleep like a baby,\nsleep like an adult be an adult,\nget your solid eight hours.\n- It's Billy Crystal's\nline, he was, you know,\na long standing suffering insomniac,\nhe says I sleep like a baby,\nI'm awake every 20 minutes.\nYou know, and I think\nthis is another one of\nthose demonstrations\nthat when you fight\nbiology, you normally lose.\nAnd the way you know you've lost\nis disease, sickness and impairment.\nAnd I think if you sleep,\nin accordance with the\nnatural biological edict\nthat we've all been given,\nlife tends to be both\nhave a higher quality\nand a longer duration.\n- Yeah, I agree.\nAlong those lines, as a vision scientists,\nI've been very excited\nby the work on these non image\nforming cells in the eye,\nthe so called melanopsin cells\nthat inform the brain about\ncircadian time of day.\nAnd I'm a big proponent of\npeople getting some sunlight,\nideally sunlight, but\nother forms of bright light\nin their eyes early in the day\nand when they want to be awake.\nEssentially, during the phase\nof their 24 hour circadian cycle\nwhen temperature is rising,\nand then starting to get\nless light in their eyes\nas our temperature is going down\nin terms of later in the\nday and in the evening.\nAre there any adjustments\nto that general theme\nthat you'd like to add?\nOr is in any way?\n- No, I think that's exactly\nwhat we recommend right now.\nWhich is try to get at\nleast 30 to 40 minutes\nof exposure to some kind\nof natural daylight.\nNow, there may be parts of the\nworld where, you know, it's.\n- You're from your from a\nrather cloudy part of the world.\n- I am from Liverpool, England,\nand the Northwest of England is not known\nfor its beach resorts and fine weather.\nI remember I sort of, I\nwent back home for a trip\nwhen I'd first been out in California,\nand I thought, why is the sky so low?\nJust you know, constantly\nwe joke that in the UK,\nwe usually have nine months of bad weather\nand then three months of Winter.\nAnd then that's your entire\nyear in terms of climate.\nBut to come to your point,\nyou're exactly right,\ntry to get that daylight.\nNow it can be you know,\nworking next to a window\nand you're getting that natural sunlight.\nBut that natural sunlight is\neven on a cloudy day in England\nis usually far more potent\nthan anything that you'll\nget from indoor lighting,\ndespite you thinking sort\nof from a perception wise,\nmaybe the much closer than I would think.\n- Yeah, I've been I'm sorry to interrupt.\nI've been a big proponent of\nthere's a an app called\nLight Meter, which will\nit's a free app, I have\nnothing to do with it\nthat will allow you to\nget a pretty decent\nmeasurement of the amount\nof light energy coming toward you.\nAnd if you hold it up to a cloudy morning,\nwhere you don't think it's very bright out\nkind of a dismal day,\nyou'll notice that\nthere'll be 1,000, 2,000,\neven you know, 5,000 Lux,\nLux just being a measure\nof brightness, of course.\nAnd then you can point\nthe same light meter\ntoward an indoor light\nthat seems very bright\nand very intense and it'll say 500 Lux\nand you realize that the\nintensity as we gauge it,\nperceptually is not really\nwhat the system is receiving.\nSo outdoor light is key.\nHow do you get this natural stimulation?\nOr I should just say light\nstimulation early in the day,\nwhat is your typical,\nwhat does Matt Walker do to\nget this light stimulation?\n- I am no poster child,\nbut usually I will, if I'm working out\nI usually work out most days.\nAnd I shopped around and I found a gym\nthat has huge amounts of window\nexposure facing to the East.\nThis is going to sound\nso ridiculous you know,\nMatt Walker chooses a gym on the basis.\n- I love it\n- Of the solar impact\nso he cannot you know\ncorrect his circadian.\n- There are a lot of\ncriteria for selecting gyms,\nthis one is actually\ngrounded in physiology,\nand biology and so.\n- And selfishness about my own sleep.\n- No it's great.\nSo you get the your exercise\nand your light stimulation simultaneously?\n- That's right, yep, yeah.\n- And so you're stacking\ncues for wakefulness\nearly in the day.\n- Exactly, so both exercise and daylight\nare wonderful cues for\ncircadian rhythm alignment,\nand also circadian rhythm reset each day.\nAnd so I will use both exercise,\nI mean, I'm neither a strong morning type\nor a strong evening type.\nAnd my preference to exercise\nis probably sometime in\nthe middle of the day,\nprobably somewhere around\n1pm sorry, not 1am.\nBut I'm usually working\nout probably around\nthe sort of seven, sort of 45 8am time,\nthat's usually when I'll start my workout.\nAnd there I will start with cardio\nspin bike facing a window.\nAnd luckily, for the most\npart here in California,\nthere's usually sunlight coming through.\nBut it doesn't matter to me\nbecause just as you said,\neven when it's a cloudy day\nthat Lux coming through of light,\nthe intensity is splendid.\nSo I would prefer to favor my exercise\njust because for efficiency too,\nI want to get also working on the day,\nI'll try to match my exercise\nmore with my circadian light exposure\nthan I would probably if I'm going to\ndo I really want to crush a workout,\nor do I want to just, you know,\nmake sure it's a good workout?\nI would prefer to work out,\nyou know, at a different time.\nBut I like that because of the daylight.\nAnd we can speak about\nexercise timing at some point,\nbecause there's a lot of\ndiscussion around that,\nwhen is the right time\nto exercise during sleep.\nAnd we can sort of bust\nsome myths there too.\nSo I think you're spot\non with the suggestion,\nget some morning daylight,\ntry to get that exposure, usually\nat least 30 to 40 minutes,\nthere was some great\nwork recently coming out\nin the occupational health domain,\nwhere they moved workers from offices\nthat were just facing walls and you know,\ndidn't have any exposure\nto natural daylight.\nAnd then they did a time\nperiod during that study\nwhere they actually were in\nfront of a window and working.\nAnd they measured their\nsleep and their sleep time\nand their sleep efficiency\nincreased quite dramatically.\nI'm forgetting the numbers now\nbut I think the increase\nin total sleep time\nis well over 30 minutes.\nAnd the improvement in sleep\nefficiency was five to 10%.\nYou know, and if you're\nbatting an 80%, you know,\nsleep efficiency average,\nwe're a bit concerned about that.\nBut add 10% to that\nand now you're in you know,\na great echelon of healthy sleepers.\nAnd all you did was just spend some time\nworking in front of windows.\n- That's great and probably\nfolks might want to consider\nspending a little less\ntime with sunglasses\nprovided they can do that safely,\nyou know, driving, etcetera.\nYou're not alone with\nyour exercise behavior\nand facing East.\nSo the one and only Tim\nFerriss told me recently\nthat his morning routine nowadays\nconsists of jumping rope while facing East\nto get the sunlight\nstimulation of the eyes.\nAnd as Matt and I both know,\nit has to be of the eyes, right?\nThese portals are the only way\nto convey to the rest\nof the brain and body\nabout the time of day and wakefulness.\nAlong the lines of wakefulness,\nI have a number of\nquestions about caffeine.\nThe dreaded and beloved\ncaffeine, I love caffeine,\nbut I like it in relatively\nrestricted periods of time.\nSo I'm a big fan of waking up\nand even though I wake up very groggy,\nallowing my natural wakefulness\nsignals to take hold,\nmeaning I wake up very slowly,\nbut I don't drink caffeine right away.\nI sort of delay caffeine\nby a little while,\nusually 90 minutes to two hours.\nAnd that idea came to me\non the basis of my understanding\nof how caffeine and the\nadenosine receptor interact.\nI have a feeling you're going to pronounce\nadenosine differently than I do.\n- No, no, I will with that,\nI will go with adenosine.\n- I've tried to go with your\nskeletal instead skeletal\nand synapse and synapse.\n- Schedule and schedule.\n- There we go.\nBut to make it really simple for folks,\nhow does caffeine work to\nmake us feel more alert?\nAnd does the timing in\nwhich we ingest caffeine\nplay an important role\nin whether or not it works\nfor us or against us?\nSo maybe we just start with\nhow does caffeine work?\nWhy is it that when I\ndrink mate or coffee,\nwhich are my preferred\nsources of caffeine,\ndo I feel a mental and physical lift?\n- Yeah so I'm going to suggest\ncounter to what most people\nwould think, drink coffee.\n- Or mate, is mate okay also?\n- [Matthew] Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n- Whatever form you enjoy.\n- We'll come on to sort\nof why I suggest that\nbut when it comes to coffee,\nI would say the dose and\nthe timing makes the poison.\nSo let's start with how caffeine works.\nCaffeine is in a class of drugs\nthat we call the psychoactive stimulants.\nSo it works through a\nvariety of mechanisms,\none is a dopamine mechanism\ndopamine we often think of\nas a reward chemical or,\nbut dopamine is also very much\nan alerting neurochemical, as well.\nAnd caffeine has some\nrole it seems to play\nin increasing dopamine.\nBut its principal mode\nof action, we believe\nin terms of making me more alert\nand keeping me awake throughout the day\nis on the effects of adenosine.\nAnd to explain what adenosine is\nfrom the moment that you\nand I woke up this morning,\nthis chemical adenosine has\nbeen building up in our brain.\nAnd the longer that we're awake,\nthe more of that adenosine accumulates,\n- Is it mask, may I ask,\nis it accumulating in neurons in glia,\nor in the blood vessels?\nWhere and is it also\naccumulating in my body?\nWhere is this adenosine coming from?\nAnd where is it accumulating?\n- Yeah, so the adenosine\nhere that we're talking about\nthat is creating the sleep pressure\nis a central brain phenomenon.\nAnd it comes from the neurons\nthemselves combusting energy.\nAnd as they're combusting energy,\none of the offshoots of that\nis this chemical adenosine.\nAnd so as we're awake throughout the day,\nand our brain is\nmetabolically very active,\nit's accumulating and\nbuilding up this adenosine.\nNow, the more adenosine that we have,\nthe sleepier that we will feel.\nSo it really is like a sleep\npressure is what we call it.\nNow, it's not a mechanical\npressure, don't worry,\nyour head's not going to explode,\nit's a chemical pressure.\nAnd it's this weight of sleepiness\nthat we feel gradually growing\nas we get into the evening.\n- May I just interrupt\nyou again to just ask\ndo we know what the circuit\nmechanism is for that?\nI mean, not to go too\nfar down the rabbit hole,\nbut for the aficionados and for myself,\nwe have brain mechanisms\nlike locus coeruleus\nthat are release things\nthat our brain areas\nlocus coeruleus is just\nbeing a brain area, of course\nthat release things that\nproactively create wakefulness.\nSo are those neurons shutting down\nas a consequence of\nhaving too much adenosine?\nOr are there areas of the brain\nthat promote sleepiness\nthat are getting activated?\nBecause these, you can imagine\nboth things working in parallel,\none or the other would\naccomplish the same endpoint?\n- Yeah and it's both.\nAnd so there are two main\nreceptors for adenosine\nthe A1 receptor and the A2 receptor.\nAnd they have different modes\nof activating brain cells\nor inactivating or decreasing\nthe likelihood of firing.\nAnd adenosine works in this\nbeautiful, elegant way,\nwhere it will inhibit and shut down\nthe wake promoting areas of the brain\nwhilst also increasing\nand dialing up the volume\non sleep activating,\nsleep promoting range.\n- Biology is so beautiful.\n- [Matthew] Oh it's fantastic.\n- There's a push pull,\nI mean, and we could\nhave a larger discussion\nat some point about that,\neverything seeing dark\nedges seeing light edges.\nOur ability to smell or\nto sense pressure on this,\neverything's a push pull in Biology.\n- Oh it's great, yeah, yep.\n- So this is another example\nwhere as I am awake longer,\nadenosine is released in the brain.\nAnd my wakefulness areas\nare being actively shut down\nby that adenosine\nand my sleepiness brain\nareas, so to speak,\nare being promoted to be\nmore active, is that correct?\n- That's right and it's a\nvery progressive process.\nIt's not like a step function, where\nand sometimes that happens occasionally,\nbut it's usually because you've\nbeen sort of driving through\nand as we'll come on to\nhave caffeine in the system,\nand then all of a sudden\nyou just hit a wall\nand it just, you know engulfs you\nand you go from zero to\nthe one of sleepiness\nwithin a short period of time.\n- What explains the fatigue\nafter a hard conversation?\nThe desire to go to sleep\nor desire to go to sleep\nduring a hard conversation?\n- That's an interesting one.\nI think it's usually just based on\npersonality type interactions.\nAnd for the most part.\n- Not that I've ever\nexperienced that before.\n- No people with you\ndon't, but with me, they.\n- Oh no, no, I've\nexperienced the desired to\nsome conversations, I'm\nhalfway through them\nand I feel like I want to take a nap.\n- Yeah.\n- Right.\n- And I would love to look at you know,\npeople's sleep history.\nWe've sort of seen that\ntime and time again,\nbut and then it could be,\nyou know, with folks like me,\npeople just lose the will to live\nwithin about five minutes\nof speaking with me, so.\n- Not true, they hear\nthat sleep is important.\n[cross talking]\n- Unrelated.\n- [Andrew] That's awesome.\n- And that's flattery, that's great.\nBut so the way that then caffeine\ncomes into this equation,\nas they're saying, it's usually\na kind of a linear process.\nOr maybe it's probably\ncloser to an exponential\nin terms of your subjective\nfeeling of sleepiness.\nAnd we haven't really been\nable to measure that in humans,\nbecause normally, we it's\nhard to actually, you know,\nstick something into the\nbrain and be, you know,\nsucking, siphoning off stuff\nevery couple of minutes,\nas you could do in animal studies.\nAnd keep asking people\nevery couple of minutes,\nhow sleepy do you feel, how sleepy?\nAnd track to see if there's\na linear rise in, you know,\nadenosine, which then creates\nan exponential rise in\nsubjective sleepiness\nor what the dynamics are,\nbut I'm kind of nerding out.\nCaffeine comes into play here,\nbecause caffeine comes into your system\nand it latches on to those\nwelcome sights of adenosine\nthe adenosine receptors.\nBut what it doesn't do is latch on to them\nand activate them.\nBecause if it was doing that,\nthen it would, you know, in lots of ways\nit would dial up more sort of sleepiness.\nIt does the opposite.\nThe way that caffeine works is that\nit comes in, competes\nwith quite sharp elbows\nwith adenosine competitively\nforces them out of the way,\nhijacks that receptor by latching onto it,\nbut then just essentially blocks it.\nIt doesn't inactivate the receptor,\nit doesn't activate the receptor,\nit functionally inactivates it\nin the sense that it takes it\nout of the game for adenosine.\nSo it's like someone you\nknow, coming into a room,\nand you're just about to\nsit down on the chair,\nand caffeine comes in and\njust pulls out the chair.\nAnd you're like, well, now\nI've got nowhere to sit.\nAnd caffeine just keeps\npulling out the chairs\nfrom adenosine and adenosine even though\nit's at the same\nconcentration in your brain,\nyour brain doesn't know\nthat you've been awake for,\nyou know, 10 hours, 16 hours\nat that point when you've\ndowned a cup of coffee.\nBecause all of that\nadenosine that's still there\ncan't communicate to the brain\nthat you've been awake\nfor 16 hours because.\n- But the adenosine is\nstill in brain circulation.\n- Correct.\n- So the real question is\nwhat happens when caffeine is dislodged\nfrom the adenosine receptor?\n- Unfortunate things happen.\nAnd that's what we call\nthe caffeine crash.\nWhich is caffeine has a half life\nand it's metabolized and.\n- Do you recall what the half life is?\n- Yeah, the half life is somewhere between\nfive to six hours.\nAnd the quarter life therefore\nis somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.\nIt's variable, different people\nhave different durations of its action,\nbut for the average\nadult five to six hours.\nThat variation, we understand\nit's down to a liver enzyme\nor a set of liver enzymes\nof the class that we call\nthe cytochrome P450 enzymes.\nAnd there are I think last\nI delved into the data,\nwhich is pretty recently,\nthere are two gene variants\nthat will dictate the enzymatic speed\nwith which the liver breaks down caffeine.\nAnd that's why you can have some people\nwho are very sensitive to caffeine\nand other people who say, you know,\nit just doesn't affect me\nreally that much at all.\n- These are the people\nthat have a double espresso\nafter a 9pm dinner and\ncan sleep just fine.\n- Well, and we'll come onto.\n- Well at least subjectively\nthey think they are sleeping.\n- Subjectively, yeah,\nand we should speak about\nthat assumptive danger too.\nSo then the caffeine is in the system\nand after some time period,\nit will be inactive in the system.\nSo let's say that, you know,\nI've been awake for 12 hours now.\nAnd it's you know, 8pm\nand I'm feeling a bit tired,\nbut I want to push through\nand I want to keep working\nfor another couple of hours,\nso I have a cup of coffee.\nAll of a sudden I was feeling tired,\nbut I don't feel like I've been\nawake for 12 hours anymore.\nBecause with the caffeine in the system,\nmaybe only half of that adenosine\nis being communicated through\nthe receptor to my brain.\n100% of the adenosine is still there,\nonly half of it is allowed\nto communicate to my brain.\nSo now I think oh I haven't\nbeen awake for 12 hours,\nI've just been awake for\nsix hours, I feel great.\nThen after a few hours,\nand the caffeine is starting\nto come out of my system,\nnot only am I hit with the\nsame levels of adenosine\nthat I had before I'd\nhad the cup of coffee\nseveral hours ago,\nit's that plus, all of the adenosine\nthat's been building up during the time\nthat the caffeine has been in my system.\n- So sort of an avalanche of adenosine.\n- It is a tsunami wave, yeah\nand that's the caffeine crash.\n- And it's interesting\nbecause the caffeine crash\nat two o'clock in the afternoon\nwhen you have work to do\nis a terrible thing.\nBut what about the person,\nmaybe this person is me in my 20s,\nwho says, I'm going to\ndrink caffeine all day long.\nAnd then I want the crash.\nBecause at nine or 10pm,\nif I stop drinking caffeine\nat say, 6pm, and I crash,\nthen I crash into a slumber,\na deep night of sleep.\nIs that sleep really as\ndeep as I think it is?\nBecause given the half life of caffeine\nthat you mentioned a few moments ago,\nI have to imagine that\nhaving some of that caffeine\ncirculating in my system\nmight disrupt the depth of sleep,\nor somehow the architecture\nof sleep in a way\nthat even if I get eight,\nor who knows even 10 hours of sleep,\nit might not be as restorative\nas I would like it to be.\n- Yeah, and that is the danger,\njust sort of that, you know,\nthose people that you described who say,\nand I, a lot of them\nwill speak with me too\nsay, look, I can have\ntwo espressos with dinner\nand I fall asleep fine and I stay asleep.\nBecause usually those\nare the two phenotypes\nthat we typically see\nwith too much caffeine.\nI just can't fall asleep\nas easily as I want to,\nor I fall asleep, but I\njust can't stay asleep.\nAnd caffeine can do both of\nthose things quite potently.\n- How late in the day do you\nthink is assuming somebody,\ntranslate this folks, if you\ngo to bed earlier or later,\nyou have to shift the hours accordingly.\nBut given somebody who typically\ngets into bed around 10:00, 10:30,\nand falls asleep around 11:00, 11:30.\nWhen would you recommend\nthey halt caffeine intake?\nAnd these are not strict prescriptives,\nbut I think people do benefit\nfrom having some fairly clear guidelines\nof what might work for them.\nWould you say cut off caffeine,\nby what time of the day?\n- I would usually say\ntake your typical bedtime\nand count back sort of somewhere\nbetween 10 to eight hours\nis probably getting a little bit close.\nBut take back sort of 10\nhours or eight hours of time,\nthat's the time when you\nshould really stop, you know,\nusing caffeine is the suggestion.\nAnd the reason is because for those people\nwho even just keep\ndrinking up until you know,\ninto the evening, you're right,\nthat they can fall asleep fine,\nmaybe they stay asleep,\nbut the depth of their deep\nsleep is not as deep anymore.\nAnd so there are two consequences.\nThe first is that for me,\nand it can be up to by 30%,\nand for me to drop your deep sleep by 30%,\nI'd have to age you by\nbetween 10 to 12 years,\nor you can just do it\nevery night to yourself\nwith a couple of espressos.\nThe second is that you then\nwake up the next morning,\nand you think, well, I didn't\nhave problems falling asleep\nand I didn't have problems staying asleep,\nbut I don't feel particularly\nrestored by my sleep.\nSo now I'm reaching for\nthree or four cups of coffee\nthe next morning,\nrather than just two or\nthree cups of coffee.\nAnd so goes this dependency cycle,\nthat you then need your uppers\nto wake you up in the morning,\nAnd then sometimes people will\nuse alcohol in the evening\nto bring them down because\nthey're overly caffeinated\nand alcohol, and we can\nspeak about that, too,\nalso has very deleterious\nimpacts on your sleep as well.\nSo you're right that it's\nnot just the quantity\nof your sleep, or even\ndifficulties falling\nor staying asleep,\nit can also be deep sleep.\nBut here again, I think, you know,\nI don't want to be frightening people.\nAnd I mentioned this before,\nI think one of the real problems that I\nor mistakes that I made,\nbecause I didn't you know,\nI'd never had much public\nexposure before the book.\nAnd I was so saddened by you know,\nthe disease and the suffering\nthat I was seeing as a\nconsequence of a lack of sleep\nin our society.\nAnd the fact that it wasn't really\nbeing discussed very much.\nI sort of came out, you know,\na little bit headstrong,\nmore than a little bit headstrong.\nAnd I think I was, you know,\nperhaps too much gas pedal\nand too little, you\nknow, break as it were.\nAnd I don't think that's the right way\nto approach a health message\nwithin the public sphere.\nAnd I've become much softer\nin how I think about these things.\nI have ideas about\nwhat the ideal world looks like for sleep.\nBut I also realize that none of us\nlive in this thing called the ideal world.\n- We certainly don't.\n- So, you know, I want to\nbe really mindful of that,\nand I think I've done a really bad job\nof being sort of too forthright,\nparticularly for people who\nstruggle with sleep, you know,\nearly on, when I would offer\nthese sort of messages about sleep.\nI want to be, you know,\nI want to be theoretical\nwhen it comes to the science,\nI want to be faithful to the science.\nBut I also don't want to go out\nand scare the living\ndaylights out of people,\nparticularly people who are\nstruggling with their sleep,\n'cause it's probably only\ngoing to make matters worse.\nSo I've been beautifully schooled by\nlearning how to be a slightly\nbetter public communicator.\nI'm nowhere near of the\nstanding that you are,\nyou are very elegant and\nit's very intuitive to you.\nI'm still with training wheels,\nbut I'm getting a little bit better.\nBut I just want to say that\nwhen I'm speaking about caffeine,\n'cause it sounds as though I'm very\nsort of overt about it.\nBut I will come back to\nwhy I say drink coffee.\nBut I just want to make that point.\n- Yeah, well, I appreciate\nyou making that point.\nAnd I'm sure our listeners will too.\nI still will stand behind my statement,\nwhich is that what you've\ndone for the notion\nthat sleep is vital for\nall aspects of health\nand for performance, mental\nand physical and wakefulness,\nthe message and the\npackaging it was contained in\nand is has been clearly\nclearly net positive\npeople needed to be cued to this.\n- Thank you.\n- The I'll sleep\nwhen I'm dead mentality is one that I had,\nit's one that other people have.\nPeople in a huge number\nof vital communities,\nnot just your students, but also people\nthat this the messaging that you provided\nand continue to provide\nhas positively impacted the\nfirst responder community,\nthe medical community,\nthere're still steps that need to be taken\nthe military community,\nand of course, the civilian community.\nAnd so I think these adjustments about\nyeah, caffeine is okay,\njust restricted to the\nearly part of the day,\nif you can, most days,\nI mean, I think the law of averages.\nIt's like the light viewing behavior\nI think it is critical to\nview sunlight or natural,\nsome other form of bright\nlight early in the day\nbut if you miss a day,\nit's not that your whole system\nis going to dissolve\ninto a puddle of tears.\nThat'll happen on the\nsecond or the third day,\nno I'm kidding, you've\ngot a couple of days.\nBiology works in averages\nexcept with respect to accident or injury.\nA car accident is a car accident, right?\nYou don't get to have three of those\nbefore the brain damage occurs\nif the accident's severe enough.\nBut with sleep behavior,\nthese homeostatic type\nbehaviors, or with food,\none chocolate sundae, is it\ngoing to kill you know? No.\nEvery night? Yeah.\nIt's going to make you\ndemented and kill you early.\nWe know this.\nAnd so I think the middle ground\nis often a hard place to achieve.\nSo I think you've done a phenomenal job.\nBut I appreciate you raising these points.\nAnd I think it's clear that we all need to\nthat we all can and should\ndo certain things better,\nincluding being gentle with\nourselves from time to time\nwhen we deviate from\nthese ideal circumstances.\nAlong these lines, I do\nwant to talk about alcohol\nbecause I think caffeine and alcohol\nrepresent the the kind of two\nopposite ends of the spectrum.\nClearly there are other stimulants.\nThere your Adderalls and\nyour high energy drinks\nthat people use.\nBut alcohol and caffeine are\nthe most commonly consumed\nstimulants and sedatives,\ndepressants as they're sometimes called.\nSo what happens when somebody has a glass?\nWe always hear a glass or\ntwo of wine in the evening\nor a cocktail after\ndinner or before dinner,\nhow does that impact their sleep?\nAnd then we'll be sure to circle back\nin terms of what is\nreasonable ranges of behavior\nwhen it comes to avoiding alcohol\nor if it's age appropriate,\net cetera, enjoying alcohol?\n- Yeah, so alcohol,\nif we're thinking about classes of drugs,\nthey're in a class of drugs\nthat we call the sedatives.\nAnd I think one of the first problems\nthat people often mistake,\nalcohol is often used as a sleep aid\nfor people who are struggling with sleep\nwhen things like over the\ncounter remedies, etcetera,\nor herbal remedies have just\nnot worked out for them.\nAnd alcohol, unfortunately,\nis anything but a sleep aid.\nThe first reason that most people use it\nis to try and help them fall asleep.\n- So and this process of\nthis event that we call falling asleep,\nI have to imagine is a process.\n- It is a process.\n- Like everything in biology,\nand that that process\ninvolves in some way,\nas we talked about push\npull before turning off\nthinking, planning, et cetera,\nand turning on some sort\nof relaxation mechanism.\nI have to imagine that these two things\nare knobs turning in opposite directions\nthat gives us this outcome\nwe call falling asleep.\nAlcohol, it seems is\nhelpful for some people\nto turn off their thoughts\nor their planning.\nIs that right?\n- Yes, it is.\nAnd so I think, you know,\nif we look at the pattern\nof brain activity,\nif I were to place you\ninside an MRI scanner,\nwhere we're looking at\nthe activity of your brain\nand watch you drifting off,\nsome parts of your brain\nwill become less active.\nOther parts will become more active.\nAnd this is the push pull model.\nIt's inhibition excitation.\nBut alcohol is quite\ndifferent in that regard.\nAlcohol is because it's a sedative,\nwhat it's really doing\nis trying to essentially\nknock out your cortex.\nIt's sedating your cortex,\nand sedation is not sleep.\nBut when we have a couple\nof drinks in the evening,\nwhen we have a couple of nightcaps,\nwe mistake sedation for sleep\nsaying, well, I always when\nI have a couple of whiskies\nor a couple of cocktails,\nit always helps me fall asleep faster.\nIn truth, what's happening is that\nyou're losing consciousness quicker,\nbut you're not necessarily falling\nnaturalistically asleep any quicker.\nSo that's one of the first sort of things\njust to keep in mind.\nThe second thing with alcohol\nis that it fragments your sleep.\nAnd we spoke about the\nquality of your sleep\nbeing just as important as the quantity.\nAnd alcohol through a\nvariety of mechanisms,\nsome of which are activation\nof that autonomic nervous system,\nthat fight or flight branch\nof the nervous system.\nAlcohol will actually have you waking up\nmany more times throughout the night.\nSo your sleep is far less continuous.\nNow, some of those awakenings\nwill be of conscious\nrecollection the next day,\nyou'll just remember waking up,\nmany of them won't be.\nAnd so but yet, your\nsleep will be littered\nwith these sort of punctured awakenings\nthroughout the night.\nAnd again, when you wake\nup the next morning,\nyou don't feel restored\nby your sleep, you know,\nfragmented sleep or non continuous sleep\nin this alcohol induced way,\nis usually not good quality sleep,\nbut you feel great on the next day.\nThe third part of alcohol\nin terms of an equation\nis that it's quite potent\nat blocking your REM sleep,\nyour rapid eye movement sleep.\nAnd REM sleep is critical\nfor a variety of cognitive functions.\nSome aspects of learning and memory\nit seems to be critical\nfor aspects of emotional\nand mental health.\n- You've described it before\nas a sort of self generated therapy\nthat occurs while we sleep.\n- Yeah, it's overnight therapy, you know,\nit's emotional first aid.\n- Certainly people that\ndon't get enough sleep\nare very easy to derail emotionally.\nNot that one would want\nto do that to people,\nbut we all sort of fall apart emotionally.\nI always think of it as almost like\nour skin sensitivity can be heightened.\n- Yes, absolutely.\n- When we are sleep deprived.\nOur emotional sensitivity is such that\nwhen we're sleep deprived,\nsuch that it takes a much\nfiner grain of sandpaper\nto create that kind of\nfriction, things bother us.\n- [Matthew] Threshold to trigger.\n- Even online comments bother\nus when we're sleep deprived.\nand never when we're well rested.\n- I would love to say\nthat I never look at them,\nexcept I look at.\n- Well actually, here I.\n- [Matthew] Maybe every one of them.\n- Here I will editorialize\nbecause the notion of\nnot looking at comments\nis unreasonable to ask of any academic,\nbecause academics we are all trained\nto look at our teaching evaluations.\nAnd just like with online\ncomments to ignore 20% of them,\nno, I'm kidding.\nWe look at them all in any event.\nSo in terms of translating\nthis to behavior,\nI'm not, I don't\nparticularly enjoy alcohol,\nI guess I might be\nfortunate in that sense.\nBut I also have never really experienced\nthe pleasure of drinking alcohol.\nI sometimes like the taste of a drink,\nbut I never like the sensation.\nSo that's, I don't have a\nlot of familiarity with this,\nbut many people do, and I understand that.\nSo let's say somebody enjoys\na glass of wine or two\nwith dinner and they eat dinner at 7pm.\nIs that likely to disrupt\ntheir sleep at all?\nLet's just sort of,\nlet's make this a series of gradations.\n- And the answer is yes.\nI think once they just looked\nat a single glass of wine\nin the evening with dinner,\nand I would be untruthful\nif I didn't just simply say\nit has an effect.\nAnd we can measure that in terms of.\n- Less REM sleep.\n- Less REM sleep\nand one of the fascinating studies\nI can't remember what dose I\nthink they got them close to\na standard illegal blood alcohol level,\nso maybe they were a little bit tipsy.\nAnd yes, you see all of the\nchanges that we just described,\nthey sort of lose\nconsciousness more quickly,\nthey have fragmented sleep,\nand they have a significant\nreduction in REM sleep.\nBut what was also interesting\nbecause REM sleep, as\nwe spoke about before,\nis a time when some hormonal systems\nare essentially recharged and refreshed\ngrowth hormone being one of them,\nthere was well over a 50% five zero drop\nin their growth hormone release\nduring alcohol laced sleep at night.\n- And growth hormone is\nso vital for metabolism\nand repair of tissues.\n- Yeah, it's not just for kids.\n- [Andrew] Keeping body fat low.\n- This is essential in adults.\n- It's essential, along those lines,\nI just want to highlight the fact that\nthis information that you're sharing\nthat growth hormone is released\nis strongly tethered to the presence of\nhealthy amounts of REM\nsleep is interesting to me,\nbecause I always thought the\ngrowth hormone was released\nin the early part of the night.\n- Well, it is released\nacross both of those,\nbut across the different stages,\nbut what we also know is that\nwhen you disrupt REM sleep,\nthere are those growth\nhormone consequences.\nSo it's not an exclusive system\njust like with testosterone,\nwe can see changes\nthroughout non REM sleep,\nbut if you ask when are\nthe peak release rates\nof testosterone, it's right\nbefore we go into REM sleep,\nand then during REM sleep.\n- And of course,\ntestosterone being important,\nboth for males and females.\n- For men and women, yeah.\n- Right, for libido and\ntissue repair and well being.\nNobody, regardless of\nchromosomal, hormonal,\nor any other background\nwants to have their normal levels\nof testosterone reduced acutely,\nthat's just a bad\nit equates to a terrible set\nof psychological and physical symptoms.\n- Yeah, and the mortality risk\nthat's associated with low testosterone\nis non trivial.\n- Prostate cancer.\n- Right, exactly, you know.\nSo coming back to just\nthe point on REM sleep\nthat you mentioned regarding\nemotional instability,\nand we see that that's one of the things\none of the most reliable\nsignatures of just\ninsufficient sleep doesn't\nhave to be sleep deprivation.\nWhat we've discovered\nover the past 20 years\nhere at The Sleep Center,\nis that there is no major\npsychiatric disorder\nthat we can find in which sleep is normal.\nAnd so I think that firstly told us\nthere is a very intimate association\nbetween your emotional mental\nhealth and your sleep health.\nBut when it also comes to REM sleep,\nI think what's fascinating is that\nit's not just about your emotional health,\nit's not just about your hormonal health\nwe've also been seeing other\naspects of you know, cognition.\nBut then there was a report,\nI think it could have\nbeen about two years ago,\nout of Harvard, I think it\nwas Beth Clements group.\nThey found that,\nand they replicated it in two\ndifferent large populations.\nIf you look at the contribution\nof different sleep\nstages to your lifespan,\nREM sleep was the strongest\npredictor of your longevity.\nAnd it was a linear relationship.\nIt wasn't it sort of one of these U shaped\nor J shaped curves that we\noften see with total sleep,\nand mortality risk, it really was linear.\nThat the less and less REM\nsleep that you were getting\nthe higher and higher\nyour probability of death.\nAnd then they did.\n- Was that death due to\nnatural causes or accident?\n'Cause I can imagine if you're\nnot getting enough REM sleep,\nyou're more likely to\ndrive off the freeway,\nstep off a cliff.\n- I think it was all cause mortal.\n- You just make bad\ndecisions about anything\nin love relationships, which\ncan also be life threatening.\n- Yeah, I've tried to lean into that\nand claim that with those\nbad relationship situations,\noh, I just didn't have\nenough REM sleep last night.\n- Blame it on the sleep.\n- [Matthew] My darling you know.\n- The REM sleep difference.\n- And, but she's far wiser than I thought.\nBut, so they did this great\nmachine learning analysis\nand I may get these numbers backwards.\nBut I think for every 5%\nreduction in REM sleep,\nthere was a 13% associated\nincreased risk of mortality.\nAnd I could have, I'll\nhave to go back and check.\nBut to me, and in the\nmachine learning algorithm,\nwhat they ultimately spat out\nwas that of all of the sleep stages,\nREM sleep is the most predictive\nof your longevity of your lifespan.\nSo we often, I hear people saying,\nhow can I get more deep sleep?\nOr they sometimes say\nhow can I get more dream sleep?\nAnd my answer is a question.\nWhy do you want to get more of that?\nAnd they'll say, well,\nisn't that the good stuff?\nAnd I'll say, well, actually\nall stages have good sleep.\n- It's all the good stuff.\nWell, it's like the exercise question\nand it took decades,\nfor people to understand\nthat moving around\nfor about 150, probably 180 minutes a week\nat doing endurance type work,\nzone two cardio type work,\nit is correlated with living longer,\nfeeling better, less diabetes, etcetera.\nThere's really no way around it.\nI mean, you can ingest Metformin\nuntil the cows come home,\nyou can take NMN,\nall of which I think have\ntheir place in certain contexts\nI'm a big fan of the work\nsurrounding all those protocols.\n- Yeah likewise.\n- But without getting\nproper amounts of movement,\nmeaning sufficient numbers,\nit doesn't matter how many\n12 minute exercise regimes\nyou follow per week, you\nneed that threshold level.\nAnd it sounds like the\nsame is true of REM sleep\nand total amount of sleep.\nThere's just you pay the piper somehow.\n- Yeah, the return on investment\nI mean, to flip the coin,\nthe return on investment\nis astronomical, you know,\nI think of sleep it is the\ntide that moves, you know,\nthat raises all of those health boats.\n- And the most fundamental layer\nof mental and physical health.\nWhenever people ask me, even\nthough I'm not a physician,\nthey'll ask me, you know,\nwhat should I take or what should I do?\nThe first question is\nalways, how's your sleep?\n- Great, I love it.\n- Meaning how well do\nyou sleep every night\nand how long do you sleep?\nAnd I always recommend your book,\nI always recommend your podcast, you know,\nthe podcasts you've been\na guest on, etcetera.\nWho knows, maybe you'll even\nrelease your own podcast\nat some point soon and keep\nbecause I do think people need\nto hear from you more often.\nOne thing I don't want to\nreturn to the notion of\npublic health discourse too much.\nBut I do want to say one\nissue with books in general,\nis that they can be revised,\nbut it's more or less a\none and done kind of thing\nuntil the next book comes out.\n- Yeah, yeah\n- One thing I like\nabout the podcast format\nis that updates can be provided regularly.\nCorrections and updates\nas new data come out.\nAnd so that's a wonderful\naspect to this format.\nAnd hopefully the format\nthat you'll be embracing,\nI think the world needs\nto hear more from you\nmore often, about sleep, and\nits various contours, not less.\nAnd so I do have a question\nabout drinking alcohol.\nNot that we want to promote day drinking,\nbut let's say that the\none or two glasses of wine\nor cocktail is consumed with lunch,\nsomething that isn't\ntraditionally done nowadays,\nor in a late afternoon\nhappy hour type cocktail.\nAnd then one is going to sleep\nseven or eight hours later,\ndo you think that\nthat will improve or somehow mitigate\nthe effects of alcohol?\nOr if you have a drink,\nare you are you basically\nscrewed for the next 24 hours?\n- No, I think there's going to\nbe a time window dependency.\nNow, I don't know of anyone\nwho has essentially done\nwhat you and I would like,\nwhich is the time separation\ndose dependent curve,\nwhere okay, you drink\nat 10am, then or 11, 12\none, two, three, four, five\nall the way up to you know, 10pm\nand estimate, what is the blast radius?\nAnd is it linear?\nOr is it nonlinear?\nIs it such that only when you\ndrink in the last four hours?\nDo you just hit this exponential\nand it's bad, bad bad?\nOr is there some other curve\nthat we could imagine there\nwill be many possibilities.\nBut certainly what we know\nis that the less alcohol\nand the less\nand more specifically\nthe metabolic byproducts,\naldehydes and ketones,\nthey're the sort of the nefarious players.\n- And not the ketones that\npeople are all excited about\nthe other ketones,\n[cross talking]\nthe chemists know what we're referring to.\n- But this is not about ketogenesis,\nplease don't think that.\n- This is not about ketogenesis,\nthere are ketone bodies,\nand that are released\nafter ingesting alcohol\nthat are not of the positive sort\nthat a ketogenic diet might promote.\n- Right, so I think in terms\nof that alcohol profile,\nwe certainly know that, you know,\nas you're heading into the evening hours,\nonce again, timing and\ndose make the poison.\nBut I think it's also\nimportant, once again,\nfrom that public message\nstandpoint, and thank you,\nI think I am leaning into\nthe sort of the podcast\nconsideration arena, at some point,\nbut I don't want to be\npuritanical here, you know,\nI'm just a scientist,\nand I'm not here to\ntell anyone how to live.\nAll I'm trying to do is empower people\nwith some of the scientific\nliterature regarding sleep.\nAnd then you can make\nwhatever informed choices\nthat you want.\nNow, unlike you, it turns\nout, I'm not a big drinker.\nIt's just because I've\nnever liked the taste.\nAnd I'm surprised that\nthey haven't taken away\nmy British passport because\nI don't like lager or beer.\nBut I also want to say\nthat life is to be lived\nto a certain degree, it's all\nabout checks and balances.\nSo, you know, if I go out and you know,\nI have an ice cream sundae,\nI'm not big on those either,\nbut, you know, sure, I\nknow that my you know,\nblood glucose is not going to be ideal\nfor another 12 hours maybe.\nThat's just the price you pay\nfor having some kind of relaxed, fun life.\nI don't want to look back on life\nand think, gosh, you know, I\nlived until I was, you know,\n111 and it was utterly miserable you know.\n- Right.\n- So, but it's all about\nsome kind of a balance.\nAnd my job is not to tell\npeople a prescription for life,\nit's just to offer some\nscientific information.\n- No, I think you're doing\na terrific job of that.\nPeople are I always say we\nhave all these neural circuits\nand if it's working properly,\nwe all have a circuit that allows us\nto skip over information\nor as we wish, right,\nif the circuits between\nyour brain and your thumbs\nare working you can slide right along\nyou can drop to the next\ncontent however you like.\nI would like to ask\nabout marijuana and CBD.\nThis is a discussion that\nI think five years ago\nwould have ventured into\nthe realm of illegal\nbut now in many places not all\nmedical marijuana is approved or is legal.\nAnd certainly it's in widespread use.\nCertainly not recommending people do it.\nI have my own thoughts\nabout marijuana CBD.\nI've been fortunate, I suppose\nthat I don't particularly\nlike marijuana or CBD.\nI don't even know if I've ever tried CBD.\nFirst of all, does marijuana\ndisrupt the depth of sleep,\nthe architecture of sleep?\nAnd if so, as with alcohol and caffeine\ndoes when you ingest it\nor when it's in your bloodstream does,\nrelative to when you go to sleep,\ndoes that play an important role?\nSo does marijuana disrupt sleep?\n- Yeah, it does.\nAnd there's a pretty\ngood amount of data on\nso we can break sort of cannabis down into\ntwo of its key ingredients.\nWe've got THC tetrahydrocannabinol,\nand we've got CBD\nand CBD is sort of the less psychotic\nwhat we think of as the non\npsychoactive components.\nIn other words, when you\ntake CBD, you don't get high.\nIf you take THC, you can get high.\nThat's the psychoactive\npart of the equation.\n- Are both considered sedatives\nin the technical sense?\n- No, they're not.\nNeither of them have that class right now.\nTHC can, seems to speed up the time\nwith which you fall asleep.\nBut again, if you look at the\nelectrical brainwave signature\nof you're falling asleep\nwith and without that THC,\nit's not going to be an ideal fit.\nSo you could argue it's non natural,\nbut many people use THC for that fact,\nbecause they find it\ndifficult to fall asleep.\nAnd it can speed the onset\nof at least non consciousness,\nI guess is the best way of describing it.\nBut there are problems with THC.\nAnd they are twofold.\nThe first is that it too,\nbut through different mechanisms\nseems to block REM sleep.\nAnd that's why a lot of\npeople when they're using\nwill tell me look, you know,\nI definitely, I was dreaming.\nOr I don't remember, you\nknow many of my dreams.\nAnd then when they stop using THC,\nlet's say I was having, you\nknow, just crazy, crazy dreams\nand the reason is because\nthere is a rebound mechanism.\nREM sleep is very clever.\nAnd alcohol is the same way in this sense,\nit's the same homeostatic mechanism.\nSome people will tell me,\nlook, if I have a bit\nof a wild Friday night\nwith some alcohol, you know,\nmaybe I'll sleep late\ninto the next morning.\nAnd I'll just have these\nreally intense dreams.\nSo and I thought I wasn't\nhaving any REM sleep,\nwell, the way it works is that\nit's during in the middle\nof the night, really,\nwhen alcohol blocks your REM sleep.\nAnd your brain is smart\nit understands how much REM\nsleep you should have had,\nhow much REM sleep you have not\nbecause the alcohol\nhas been in the system.\nAnd finally, in those early morning hours,\nwhen you're getting through\nto sort of, you know,\n[cross talking]\nsix, seven, 8:00am all of a sudden,\nyour brain not only goes back\nto having the same amount\nof REM it would have had,\nit does that plus it tries to get back\nall of the REM sleep that it's lost.\nDoes it get back all of the REM sleep?\nNo, it doesn't.\nIt never gets back all of\nthe REM sleep, but it tries.\nAnd so you have these really\nintense periods of REM sleep.\nHence you have really\nintense bizarre dreams.\nAnd that's what happens also with THC,\nyou build up this pressure for REM sleep,\nthis debt for REM sleep,\nwill you ever pay it back?\nDoesn't seem as though you get back\neverything that you lost,\nbut will you get back some of it?\nYes, the brain will start to devour more\nbecause it's been starved\nof REM sleep for so long.\nBut one of the bigger problems with THC\nthat we worry about is\nwithdrawal dependency.\nSo as you start to use THC for sleep,\nthere can be a dependency tolerance.\nSo you start to need more to\nget the same sleep benefit.\nAnd when you stop using,\nyou usually get a very\nsevere rebound insomnia.\nAnd in fact, it's so potent\nthat it's typically part of the clinical\nwithdrawal profile from THC from cannabis.\n- And there's anxiety withdrawal.\nI you know, I don't ask anybody\nto change their behavior,\nwe just as you said, we\ntry and inform people\nabout what the science says\nand let them make choices for themselves.\nPeople who are regular pot smokers,\nif you many of will insist\nthey're not addicted,\nand maybe indeed they don't\nactually follow the profile\nof classical addiction, I don't know.\nI'm guessing some do, some don't.\nBut if you ask them\nwell, what if I took away all\nmarijuana consumption for,\nI don't know, two weeks?\nThat thought scares many of them.\nAnd many of them will experience\nintense anxiety without marijuana,\nwhich speaks to perhaps not addiction,\nbut a certain kind of dependency.\nAnd again, you know, I\nknow many pot smokers,\nsome of whom have jobs\nthat are quite high\nperforming and they manage.\n- Here in Berkeley, I\ndon't know any of those.\n- Yeah, none of those, right.\nWhat about CBD?\nI mean, we hear so much about CBD,\nI've been a little concerned\nabout the fact that\nthe analysis of a lot of\nCBD supplements out there\nhas confirmed that much\nlike with melatonin,\nthe levels that are\nreported on the labels,\nin no way shape, or form,\nmatch the levels that\nare actually contained\nin the various supplements.\nSometimes the levels are much higher\nthan they're reported on the labels.\nOther times, it's much lower.\nWhat does ingesting CBD do\nto the architecture and quality of sleep?\n- Right now, I don't\nthink we have enough data\nto make some kind of, you know,\nmeaningful sense out of it.\nI think the picture that\nis emerging, however,\nis probably the following.\nFirstly, CBD does not\nseem to be detrimental\nin the same ways that THC is.\nSo we can start by saying\ndoes it create you know,\npotential problems,\nnot of the nature necessarily\nthat we see with THC.\nBut the devil is a\nlittle bit in the details\nfrom the data that we do have\nand it comes on to your\nvalid point of purity.\nAt low dose, CBD can seem\nto be wake promoting.\nSo in lower doses,\nlet see sort of five or 10 milligrams\nand trying to remember some of the studies\noff the top of my head,\nthere it actually may enhance wakefulness\nand cause problems with sleep.\nIt's only once you get\ninto the higher dose range,\nthat there seem to have\nbeen some, you know,\nincreases sorry, increases in sleepiness,\nor sort of sedation like, increases.\nAnd that's usually I think,\nabove about 25 milligrams,\nas best I can recall from the data.\nAnd then when we look in animal models,\nyou typically see the\nsame type of profile too.\nSo then the question becomes\nand now again, you just don't\nknow about, you know, purity.\nIt's very difficult,\nalthough I think, and again,\nI'm not a user,\nnot necessarily because I you know,\nhave anything against it.\nIt's just that's not, you know,\nnecessarily my cup of tea.\nThere are some firms that are now doing\nthird party independent laboratory tests.\nI don't know how gamed that is,\nso I've got no sense of it.\n- I think some supplement companies\nare quite honest and accurate\nabout the amounts of various substances\nthat are in their\nproducts and some are not.\nAnd I think there's just a huge range.\nI think the FDA is starting\nto explore CBD there\nI certainly I saw some grant announcements\nto explore the function of CBD.\nMost of the work on CBD is\nbeing done by the general public\nadjusting it and seeing how they feel.\nI gave it to my dog who was\nhad some dementia related\nsleep disturbances,\nand it actually created\na heightened wakefulness\nit completely screwed up his sleep.\n- Okay, it sounds as\nthough it just wasn't.\n- He's a bulldog.\nSo if he's going to get access\nto sleep, he's going to take it.\n- Okay.\n- Really messed him up,\ntook him took it away, he did better.\nBut you know, that's a canine, so.\n- Right, and it could have been, you know,\nsort of dose related too.\n- Or binders or other things\nthat are in there, sure.\n- Correct, yeah and we,\nbut right now, if we were to,\nand I'm not making the statement,\nI don't think anyone can\nmake the statement now.\nBut if it ends up being that CBD\nis potentially beneficial for sleep,\nhow can we reconcile that mechanistically?\nAnd I think there are, to me, at least,\nthere are at least three\ncandidate mechanisms\nthat I've been exploring\nand thinking about.\nThe first is that it's thermo regulatory.\nAnd what we found in some animal models\nis that CBD will create\na profile of hypothermia.\nIn other words, it cools the body\nthe core body temperature down.\nAnd that's something that\nwe know is good for sleep.\nThe second is that it's an anxyolitic,\nthat it can reduce anxiety.\nAnd that data is actually quite strong,\neven with some functional imaging work\nthat's been coming out recently\nshowing that one epicenter of\nemotion called the amygdala\ndeep within the brain is\nquietened down with CBD.\nSo I think that's at least a\nsecond non mutually exclusive.\n- That's great, that's conducive.\n- You know, possibility.\nI think the third is some recent data\nthat's come out that was suggesting\nthat CBD can alter the\nsignaling of adenosine.\nSo it doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you produce more adenosine,\nbut what it can do is perhaps modulate\nthe sensitivity perhaps of the brain,\nso that the weight of that same adenosine\nis weightier in its brain signal,\nand therefore it creates this\nstronger pressure for sleep.\nSo I think these are all\ntentative mechanisms.\nI think any one of them is viable,\nI think all three are viable together.\nBut right now I think,\ndoes that sort of help think through\nthe tapestry of THC and CBD?\n- Yeah very much so and\nactually, it's a perfect segue\nfrom we've talked about\ncaffeine, alcohol, THC and CBD\nas sort of, we framed them anyway,\nas things that done in moderation\nat the appropriate times,\nare probably okay for most people.\nCertainly not for everybody,\nthere will be differences in sensitivity.\nBut that done at the incorrect times,\nand certainly in the incorrect amounts\nwill greatly disrupt this vital\nstage of life we call sleep.\nCBD, it seems, represents a kind of bridge\nto the topic I'd like to talk about next,\nwhich is things that\npromotes more healthy sleep,\nor somehow contribute to\nenhancing the architecture\nand quality of sleep.\nSo I'd love to chat for a moment about\nthe kind of grand,\nthe original I should say that\nnot the granddaddy but the\nOG of sleep supplementation,\nwhich is melatonin.\nThe so called hormone of darkness\nthat's inhibited by light, etcetera.\nFrame for us, melatonin\nin the context of its\nnaturally occurring form.\nAnd then I'd like to talk\nabout melatonin the supplement\nbecause in my experience,\nanytime I say the word melatonin,\npeople think about the\nsupplement melatonin,\nwhich in itself is an\ninteresting phenomenon\nthat people are so cued to its role\nas something you take,\nwe often forget that this is something\nthat we make endogenously.\nI'd love for you to comment in particular\non even though without\nnecessarily getting into\nits precise nanograms\nper deciliter values,\nwhat are the typical amounts of melatonin\nthat we release each night?\nAnd then I'd like to compare that\nto what is contained in\nsay a three milligram\nor six milligram tablet that\none might buy at the pharmacy.\n- Right, yeah.\n- So I go to sleep at night,\nhas melatonin already kicked in\nbefore I shut my eyes\nand lay down my head?\n- Usually, yes, if your system is working\nin the correct way,\nas dusk is starting to happen,\nso let's say that you look\nat hunter gatherer tribes\nwho aren't touched by electricity,\nand so that's sort of the\npuritanical state par excellence\nwhen it comes to electric light influence.\nAnd usually, it's as dusk is approaching,\nthat's when melatonin will start to rise.\nAnd so when you lose the brake pedal\nof light coming through the eyes,\nthat normally acts like a hard brake pedal\nthat stamps down and prevents the release\nand production of melatonin.\nAs that light brake pedal\nstarts to fade with dusk,\nthen we ease off the brake pedal\nand melatonin the spigot\nof melatonin is opened up,\nand melatonin starts getting released.\nAnd usually we'll see this\nrising peak of melatonin\nsometime, usually an hour,\ntwo hours later or around\nand it varies from different people\naround the time of sleep itself.\nBut it's already been on\nthe march for some hours\nbefore you actually hit sleep itself.\n- Interesting, and I was always taught\nand I'm assuming it's still true\nthat the only source of\nmelatonin in the brain and body\nis the pineal gland.\nIs that still true?\n- Yeah, it seems to be\nfrom best that we can tell\nthe pineal gland sort of\nmeaning pea like sort of shape.\nIt's actually I think usually\npeople say it's pea like,\nI think if you look at the\nLatin derivative, it's more,\nI think it's derived\nfrom pine cone, not pea\nbecause in fact, if\nyou look at the pineal,\nit is more pine cone shaped\nand so is aptly named.\n- Any human brain I've ever dissected\nor I confess I've dissected a lot\n'cause I teach neuroanatomy\nand have for years.\nI love looking at the pineal\nit's the one structure in the brain\nthat's not on both sides.\nIt's usually pretty easy to find.\nAnd it's a pretty good size.\nIt looks like a,\nit looks like a pea.\nAnd it's sitting right there.\nAnd it's remarkable that\nit releases this hormone.\nSort of probably our entire\nlifespan is inhibited by light.\nSo our pineal starts to release this\ninto the general circulation.\nI have to imagine we\nhave melatonin receptors\nin the brain and body.\n- It's correct, so yep, essentially,\nyour brain has a central\nMaster 24 hour clock\ncalled the super charismatic nucleus\nthat keeps internal time.\nNow it's not a precise clock\nif left to its own devices,\nnothing that a Swiss clock\nmaker would be proud of.\nIt runs a little bit long and laggy.\n- It's like an American clock.\nThere are a couple of good\nAmerican watches by the way,\nHamilton's are very nice, but.\n- It's very much like a bug.\n- We're not famous for our timekeeping\nor our punctuality for that\nmatter, but the Swiss are.\n- It's very it's not quite Swiss, like\nit's more Berkeley like,\nwhich is very relaxed.\nOh you know what whatever.\nSo in most adults, the\naverage adult, I should say,\nyour biological clock normally\nruns a little bit long,\nit's about 24 hours and 30 minutes,\nI think was the last calculation.\nBut the reason that we don't\nkeep drifting forward in time\nand kind of running consistently,\nyou know, more and later and later,\n30 minutes by 30 minutes\nby 30 minutes each day,\nis because your central brain clock\nis regulated by external\nthings such as daylight\nand temperature, as well\nas food and activity.\nAll of these are essentially\ndifferent fingers\nthat come along and on the\nwristwatch of the 24 hour clock\nwill pull the dial out\nand reset it each day\nto precisely 24 hours.\nAnd I make that point because\nit knows 24 hour time,\nbut it needs to tell the rest\nof the brain and the body,\nthe 24 hour time as well.\nAnd one of the ways that it does this\nis by communicating a chemical signal\nof 24 hour nurse of light and day\nusing this hormone, melatonin.\nAnd when it is at low levels,\nor it's non existent,\nit's communicating the\nmessage it's daytime,\nand for us diurnal species,\nit says it's time to be awake.\nYet, at nighttime,\nwhen dusk approaches and the\nbreak comes off melatonin\nand we start to release it,\nthen it signals to the rest\nof the brain and the body,\nlook, it's dusk and it's nighttime.\nAnd for us diurnal species,\nit's time to think about sleep.\nSo melatonin essentially\ntells the brain and the body\nwhen it's day and when it's night,\nand with that when it's time to sleep\nwhen it's time to wake.\nAnd therefore, that's why melatonin helps\nwith the timing of the onset of sleep.\nBut it doesn't really help\nwith the generation of sleep itself.\nAnd this is why we'll come on to\nwhat those studies of\nsupplementation have taught us.\n- So it tells the rest\nof my brain and body,\nit's time to go to sleep.\nIt perhaps even aids with\nthe transition to sleep\nbut it's not going to for instance,\nensure the overall structure of sleep\nor it's not the conductor\nthat's guiding the sleep\norchestra so to speak\nthroughout the entire night.\n- Yeah, it's.\n- It's more like the\npeople that essentially\ntake you to your seat\nand sit you down and\ngive you your program.\n- Right, exactly yeah,\nsort of the the fall,\nless sophisticated analogy\nI have is, you know,\nmelatonin is like the starting official\nat the 100 meter race in the Olympics.\n- That's a better analogy, yeah.\n- It calls all of the\nsleep racers to the line\nand it begins the great sleep race.\n- Yeah, better analogy by the way.\n- [Matthew] It doesn't help\ndissipate, no, no, no, no.\n- Coming from the sleep\nresearcher of all people.\n- But it doesn't participate\nin the race itself.\nThat's a whole different\nset of brain chemicals\nand brain regions.\nWhich then brings us on to\nperhaps the question of supplementation,\nwhich is, is it helpful for my sleep?\nWill I sleep longer?\nWill I sleep better?\nAnd if I am, what dosage\nshould I be taking?\nSadly, the evidence in healthy adults\nwho are not older age suggests that\nmelatonin is not really\nparticularly helpful as a sleep aid.\nI think there's a recent meta analysis\nthat demonstrated when\nit looked at all of the\ndifferent sleep parameters,\nmelatonin, and a meta analysis\nfor those not knowing what that is,\nit's a scientific sort\nof method that we use\nwhere we gather all the individual studies\nand we put them in a big bucket\nand we kind of do this kind of statistical\nfancy sleight of hand.\nAnd we try to come up with a big picture\nof what all of those\nindividuals studies tell us.\nAnd what that meta\nanalysis told us is that\nmelatonin will only increase\ntotal amount of sleep\nby 3.9 minutes, on average.\n- Minutes?\n- [Matthew] Minutes.\n- Not even percent.\n- And it will only increase\nyour sleep efficiency by 2.2%.\nSo it really.\n- This is as they say, in\ncertain parts of California,\nthat's weak sauce, that's\na weak sauce effect.\n- The sauce is not strong,\nthe force is not strong in this one,\nwhen it comes to a tool\nthat in healthy people\nwho are not of older age,\nit doesn't seem to be\nespecially beneficial.\nNow, you know, results can vary.\nEveryone is different, of course.\nSo we're talking about the average,\nthe so called average human adult here.\n- Well, melatonin, in\ndefense of what you're saying\nand also I should mention,\nI have a colleague at\nStanford, Jamie Seitzer.\n- Oh, wonderful, genius.\n- Chuck Seitzer's lab at Harvard Med\nwhere he also trained\nterrific sleep researcher\nand I asked him about melatonin\nand he essentially said the\nsame thing that you just said\nwhich is very little if any evidence\nthat it can improve sleep\nand yet it's probably the\nmost commonly consumed\nso called sleep aid.\n- Hundreds of million dollars industry.\n- Yeah, so either massive placebo effect\nor it's operating through\nsome other mechanism\nrelated to quelling anxiety perhaps?\n- Well, yeah, that's essentially\ninteresting, you know,\nthere are some studies where\nyou do see some, you know, effects.\nNow, again, when you do the\ngrand average of all studies,\nit just doesn't seem to have an effect.\nBut let's assume that for some people,\nit does have an effect\nlet's not again be sort of\ncompletely dismissive of that,\nhow could it have that effect?\nOne of the reasons\nthat I've become a little\nbit more bullish on melatonin\nfrom a sleep perspective\nand then melatonin more generally for a,\nmaybe you can speak about this too,\nas a counter measure\nwhen you're undergoing insufficient sleep.\nThere are two different routes there.\nThe first reason that I think\nit could have a sleep\nbenefit for some people\nis not because it helps in\nthe generation of sleep,\nwe know that it doesn't,\nit's because it too seems to\ndrop core body temperature.\n- There it is, temperature again.\nI'm fascinated these days,\nmore and more by temperature,\nas maybe not just a\nreflection of brain state\nand wakefulness and in sleep,\nbut actually a lever\nthat is quite powerful.\n- I think it's both.\n- And with all the interest\nin ice baths and hot showers\nand saunas and stuff,\nsomething that we will\ndefinitely touch on.\nTemperature variation is so key.\nSo if melatonin is\ndropping body temperature\nby a degree or so something\nthat you've said before\ncan help induce a sleepy state.\nMaybe that's what's allowing\npeople to get in to sleep.\n- I think that's one possibility.\nI don't think melatonin by itself\nwill drop it by it sort\nof, you know, a degree,\ncertainly not a degree Celsius.\nAnd for order in us to fall asleep,\nand then stay asleep across the night,\nwe do need to drop our\ncore body temperature\nby about one degree Celsius,\nor about two to three degrees Fahrenheit.\nAnd that's why it's always easier\nto fall asleep in a room\nthat's too cold than too hot.\nI think that that's one potential avenue\nthat we are considering\nthinking more deeply about\nwhen it comes to melatonin.\nAnd then the other is\nmelatonin as an antioxidant.\nBut let me table that for now.\n'Cause I'll just get us sidetracked.\nThat's what we know so far about melatonin\nin terms of its supplementation\nbenefit or lack thereof.\nTwo final points that I shouldn't forget,\none is the only population\nwhere we typically see\nsome benefit, and it often is prescribed\nis in older adults, because as we.\n- Older meaning 60 and older?\n- Yeah, 60, 65 and older\nbecause as we get older,\nyou can typically have what's called\ncalcification of the pineal gland.\nWhich means that that gland\nthat's releasing melatonin\ndoesn't work as well anymore.\nAs a consequence, they tend to\nhave a flatter overall curve\nof melatonin release throughout the night.\nIt's not this beautiful, lovely peak,\nand this bullhorn message of its darkness,\nplease get to sleep.\nThat's why older adults can\nhave problems falling asleep\nor staying asleep.\nIt's not the only reason by\nany stretch of the imagination.\nBut it's one of the reasons\nand it's why melatonin\nsupplementation in those cohorts,\nolder adults, and especially\nolder adults with insomnia,\npeople have thought about that\nas maybe an appropriate use case.\n- Well, along those lines,\nif we were to compare dosages, I don't,\ndo we know how much melatonin\nis typically released into\nthe bloodstream per night?\nAnd can we use that as a\nkind of a rule of thumb\nby which to compare the typical amount\nthat someone would supplement?\nTypically, the supplements\nfor melatonin that I see\nin the pharmacy and elsewhere online\nrange anywhere from one milligram to 12,\nor even 20 milligrams.\nMy guess is that a normal\nnight's release of melatonin\ntypical for somebody\nin their 20s, 30s, 40s\nwould be far lower than\nthat, am I correct or wrong?\n- Yeah, it's many magnitudes lower.\nAnd this is one of the problems\nis that I see that too.\nI see, you know, typical\ndoses are, you know,\nfive milligrams or 10 milligrams\nand of course, you know, if\nyou're a supplement company,\nyou know, putting 10 milligrams\nversus five milligrams,\nif that's what you're actually doing,\nwhich we'll speak about purity as well.\nYou know, it's kind of\nlike the super gulp size,\nnobody wants to lower price,\nthey just want you to you know,\nwe'll just give you\nmore for the same price.\nAnd that's how we'll compete.\nSo it's been this escalating arms race\nof melatonin concentration,\nand it really does not look meaningful\nfor, you know, for sleep in any way.\nWhat we've actually found\nis that the optimal doses\nfor where you do get sleep benefits\nin the populations that we've looked at,\nare somewhere between 0.1 and\n0.3 milligrams of melatonin.\nIn other words, the\ntypical doses are usually\n10 times, 20 times maybe more\nthan what your body\nwould naturally expect.\nAnd this is what we call a\nsupra physiological dose.\nIn other words, it's far above\nwhat is physiologically normal?\nYou know, and to put that in context,\nimagine I said to you,\nI want you to eat 20\ntimes as much food today.\n- I thought you're going to\nuse testosterone as example.\nYou're going to take 300 times\nthe normal amount of testosterone\nwe know that would have\ntons of deleterious effects\nit would be terrible.\nAnd yet you can do this.\nOne thing that I'm concerned about\nabout these super physiological\nlevels of melatonin\nis that many years ago,\nactually, here at Berkeley,\nwhen I was a graduate student,\nwe would inject animals\nwhich were seasonally breeding\nanimals with melatonin.\nAnd the consequence of\nthat was that their gonads,\neither their testes or\novaries would shrink,\nmany hundred fold or more.\nIn other words, they would go from having\nnice healthy sized hamster testicles,\nwhat a hamster would consider\nhealthy size for a hamster\nand they would shrink to\nthe size of a grain of rice.\nSo from like an almonds to a\ngrain size of a grain of rice.\nI had to see that only once\nfor me to be very concerned about\nsuper physiological levels of melatonin.\nAnd I realized that melatonin\ndoes different things\nin different species.\nWe are not hamsters, we\nare not seasonal breeders\nseasonally restricted breeders,\nthere might be more breeding\nduring certain seasons,\nI don't know those data.\nBut nonetheless, hormones are powerful.\nAnd sure there is an optimal,\nand sometimes we see that going\nslightly above endogenous\nlevels for certain hormones\nnot always, can have beneficial effects.\nAnd sometimes it can\nhave detrimental effects.\nI'm just concerned\nabout taking high levels\nof a hormone that has effects\non the reproductive axis\nand that's one of the reasons\nwhy I get very concerned\nwhen I see people really\ngetting aggressive\nabout melatonin supplementation\ntaking 100, 10, 500,\nsometimes even 10,000 times\nthe amount that we would normally release.\nThat's my concern,\nalthough it's not nested in\nany one specific human study.\nI just don't like to see,\nI certainly don't want to see other people\nand I don't want to\npersonally take a hormone\nthat's known to be androgen\nsuppressive at high levels.\nWhy would I take that?\nThat's the question I ask myself.\n- I think it's a very,\nyou know, good point.\nAnd if you look at some of\nthe evidence around, you know,\nmelatonins lethality if you\nwant to go to that extreme,\nfor the most part, you\nknow, it's pretty safe.\n- You mean, you can take a\nlot of it before you die?\n- Right, exactly yeah.\n- But I don't know that\nthat's the criteria.\n- That should be your yardstick for,\nbecause, you know, you\nreally need to think about\nyour, you know, your health,\nnot just whether this thing\nis going to kill you or not\nas the decision matrix\nthrough which you pop a pill.\nAnd it comes on to this\nconcern around melatonin\nbecause there was a study,\nI think it's one that you mentioned too\nwhere they looked at over,\nI think it was at least\nover 20 different brands\nof melatonin supplements.\nAnd what they found is\nthat based on what it said,\non the bottle versus what was\nin the capsules themselves,\nit ranged from, I think it was 83% less\nthan what it said on the bottle\nto 478% more than what\nit said on the bottle.\nNow, if that's a 10\nmilligram, you know, pill,\nand it's 478% more than 10 milligrams,\nand we're already at 10 milligrams\nat many tens of times more\nthan is a physiological rather than\na supra physiological dose,\nwe do need to be a bit thoughtful.\n- Yeah, remember those hamsters folks.\nWell, and I do appreciate\nthe deep dive on melatonin\nbecause I think people need to understand\nthat it's nuanced, it's\na matter of dosages,\nand timing, etcetera.\nAnd then it may have its place\nas you mentioned in older individuals.\nAnd I should mention\nthat I'm an avid consumer\nof supplements that I believe in for me\nand I have been for a very long time.\nSo I'm by no means anti supplement.\nSome supplements I refuse\nto take or avoid taking\nothers I quite avidly take\nand along those lines,\nI personally and I don't know\nwhat your thoughts on this are.\nBut there are a few things\nthat I've personally found beneficial.\nI love your thoughts on them.\nAnd I would love it if\nyou would tell me that\neverything I'm about\nto refer to is placebo,\nthat would be fine.\nSo that's what we do,\nwe're scientists we argue\nand then we remain friends\nin as it goes away.\nSo magnesium, there are\nmany forms of magnesium.\nMagnesium citrate is a as we know,\nis a terrific laxative.\nMagnesium malate seems, at\nleast from a few studies\nseems to relieve some of\ndelayed onset muscle soreness\ndoesn't seem to create a kind of sedation.\nTwo forms of magnesium\nthat I'm aware of magnesium biglycinate\nand magnesium threonate.\nWe believe based on the\ndata can more actively cross\nthe blood brain barrier.\nSo you put in your gut,\nbut some of that needs\nto go into your brain\nin order to have the sedative effect.\nWhat are your thoughts on\nmagnesium supplementation?\nDo you supplement with magnesium?\nAnd what studies would\nyou like to see done\nif they haven't been done already.\n- So I don't supplement with magnesium.\nBut I do think threonate is interesting\nbecause of that higher capacity\nto cross the blood brain barrier\nand actually have a central\nnervous system effect.\nAnd the reason that that interests me\nis because the sleep is\nby the brain of the brain,\nand also for the brain,\nas well as for the body.\nWe just don't have a\nparticularly good set of studies\nthat have targeted exclusively threonate.\nWe do have lots of studies\nthat have just looked at\nmagnesium in general for sleep.\nAnd overall, the data is uncompelling.\n- Interesting.\n- And for a while,\nI was confused as to why,\nwhere did this come from this\nkind of myth of magnesium?\nSo I started looking\nback into the literature\nand I've best traced it at\nleast as far as I can tell,\nto early studies showing that\nthose who are deficient in magnesium\nalso had sleep problems.\nThey had other problems too, of course,\nbut sleep problems were\none of that set of sequelae\nthat came from having lower magnesium.\nAnd when they supplemented with magnesium\nand tried to restore those levels,\nsome of those sleep problems dissipated.\nAnd then that seems to have gotten lost\nin sort of some game of sort of like\nwhispers around the room\nand it's become translated into\npeople who don't have sleep problems,\nwho are healthy sleepers, and\nwho are healthy in general,\nand who have healthy\nnormal levels of magnesium,\nif they take more magnesium,\nthey will sleep better.\nAnd the data really, there is not good.\nOnce again, the only study that I've seen\nwhere magnesium did have some efficacy\nwas in a study with older adults,\nI think they were 60 to 80 years old,\nit may have been exclusively women,\nnow I think about it\nand they also had insomnia.\nAnd in that population,\nyou did see some benefits.\nAnd my guess is that\nbecause it's an older community as well,\nthey were probably deficient in magnesium.\nSo they fit the former category\nof simply when you're\ndeficient, and you restore,\nyou can help sleep sort\nof return to normal.\nBut if you are not deficient\nand you're healthy,\nand you're not old and\nyou don't have insomnia,\nand you're supplementing\nthinking that it provides\nsleep, right now,\nthe data isn't supportive of that.\nBut I just don't think we\nhave enough threonate data\nto actually speak about that,\nbecause it could just be a\nblood brain barrier issue\nso far with the other forms.\n- So maybe some additional studies\nlooking specifically at\nthreonate or bi-glycinate\nwould be useful.\n- I'd love to have.\n- Magnesium is involved in\nso many cellular processes,\nyou can imagine that this\neffect, if it truly exists is,\nas we say, in science in the noise,\nmeaning it's in the jitter of the data,\nbut to isolate the real effect\none needs to do some more refined studies.\nWhat are some things that\nare of interest to you,\nif not things that you happen to take?\nThese are not things\nthat I personally take\nmostly because I just haven't\nexperimented with them.\nvalerian root is one,\ntart cherry and kiwi fruit.\nTell me about Valerian root,\ntart cherry and kiwi fruit.\nThis is new to me.\nI have certainly heard of them.\nAnd tart cherry and Kiwi sounds delicious,\nbut what's happening with\nValerian root tart cherry and kiwi\nand are we talking about\neating tart cherries and Kiwis\nand Valerian roots?\n- Yes.\n- Or are talking about\ntaking them in pill form?\n- Usually it's supplements,\nbut it's also both for tart\ncherries and for kiwis.\nIt's the actual, you\nknow, fruit themselves.\nValerian often touted as\na beneficial sleep aid\nand lots of people swear by it too.\nBut the evidence is\nactually quite against that.\n- Oh really?\n- Not that it makes\nyour sleep worse,\nbut of at least the seven good studies\nthat I've been able to find,\nand typically these are of the nature\nof what we call a randomized\nplacebo crossover design.\nAnd I won't bore people\nwith what that means\nit's sort of one of the.\n- Good studies, solid studies.\n- Yeah, it's one of the sort\nof gold standard methods\nthat we have when we're\nlooking at intervention studies\nsuch as drugs studies.\nFive of the seven found no benefits\nof Valerian root on sleep.\nThen two out of the seven, the\ndata was just insufficient.\nI think it was a power issue\nwhere they just couldn't\nmake any strong conclusions.\nAnd then I think there\nwas the most recent study,\nI think looked at two\ndifferent doses of Valerian\nand I could have this wrong\nand they just failed to\nfind any effects once again,\nbut the stunning part of\nthat paper, as I recall,\nthey had this big table\nwith all of the different sleep\nmetrics that they looked at.\nAnd there were well\nover 25 different things\nthat they tried to see\nif valerian impacted.\nAnd none of them were significant.\nWhich stuns me because from\nstatistical probabilities,\nwe know, if you just randomly\nperform 25 statistical tests,\nchances are probabilistically,\nyou'll just get one significant\nresult by random chance.\nAnd even with random chance on their side,\nthey still couldn't find\na benefit of Valerian, so.\n- So Valerian root might be\nworse than nothing at all,\nif there is, so to speak.\n- I mean, again, placebo effect\nwe can think about that too.\nAnd I would say that if you feel as though\nit's having a benefit for you,\nand with all of the caveats\nthat we have with supplements,\nthings like melatonin purity,\nconcentration, et cetera,\nyou know, maybe it's no harm no foul.\nBut I'm not a you know, a medical doctor\nand I don't tell anyone about\nwe have all of these disclaimers\nabout not recommending such things.\n- And we'll include these,\nI mean, I always say, you\nknow, we're not physicians,\nwe don't prescribe anything.\nWe're scientists and professors\nso we profess things.\nIt's up to people to be\nresponsible for their own health.\nNot just to protect us\nbut to protect themselves.\nI do want to hear about\ntart cherry and kiwi fruit.\nWhat's the story there?\n- Strange, isn't it?\nI was, you know, I'm kind\nof a hard nosed scientist,\nand when people you know,\nsome years ago started saying,\noh, tart cherries, it's\nthe thing or kiwi fruits,\nI was thinking, oh, my\ngoodness, the sounds a bit.\n- You've been in California\na little too long.\n- Yeah, I know, yeah, the\nsun is softened me some.\nBut I thought, look\none of the things that we\nhave to do as scientists\nis be as open minded as possible.\nAnd I should not be so quick to dismiss.\nSo I went to the literature\njust started reading as\nmuch as I could about it.\nAnd there were three really good\nrandomized placebo crossover\ntrials with tart cherries.\nAnd what they found was that in one study,\nit reduced the amount of time\nthat you spent awake at\nnight by over an hour.\nAnd then the other two studies,\none of them found that it\nincreased the amount of sleep\nthat you've got by 34 minutes.\nThe other it increased the\namount of sleep that you got\nby 84 minutes.\nWhich you know, these are,\nand what's striking is that\nthey were independent studies,\nI think, meaning that they\nwere from independent groups,\nand these were, you know,\nsome of these guys, you know,\nand girl, I know pretty\nwell, and they are really.\n- You know and trust their work.\n- Right, I really trust their work too.\n- Were they ingesting actual tart cherries\nor they're drinking the\njuice or in capsule form?\n- It was juice.\nSo they in all three\nstudies, it was juice.\nAlthough you can I think as a supplement,\nyou can buy it in a capsule,\nand we've got no idea whether that\nchanges the benefit or not.\nWhat was also interesting in\nI think it was that last study\nwhere they got an increase\nin sleep by 84 minutes,\nit also decreased a daytime\nnapping significantly.\n- That's one that I could\ncertainly make use of.\nI love my day time naps,\nbut I'd love to skip them too.\n- Right and we can speak about naps\nand sort of the upside\nand downside of that.\nWhich then made me think\nwell, if that's the case,\nmay be the net net\nbenefit on sleep overall,\nis no different.\nIt's just that it decreases\nthe amount of time that some people\nwere taking to sleep during the day,\nand giving it back to the night.\nBut that wasn't the case,\n'cause if you added the\ntotal amount of sleep\nthat they were getting\nwithout tart cherries,\nboth naps and nightly sleep combined,\nstill, when you took tart cherries,\nyou still got a net some benefit,\nof total amount of sleep.\nSo you know, so far,\nwhen it comes to supplements,\nand those types of studies,\nthey're good studies,\nand the data looks interesting.\nBut as a drug itself, you know,\nif this was clinical drug, you know,\nthree studies that are\nsomewhat small in nature\nand have some positive benefit\nthat's what we would call preliminary data\nof maybe a chin scratching\nkind so keep this in context.\n- Yeah, and depending on\nthe margins for safety,\none might think,\nwell, given that it's a tart cherry\nas opposed to some pharmaceutical\nyou need a prescription for\nthen, you know, some\npeople their threshold\nto experiment with\nsupplements is quite low,\nsome people their threshold is quite high.\nI feel like you know,\nthere are two categories,\nor at least two categories\nof folks out there.\nPeople who hear oh, tart\ncherry can improve sleep,\nand we'll run out and try it.\nAnd people who hear\nwell, that sounds crazy.\nWhy would I do that?\nBut of course, we have to remind people\nthat tart cherry isn't really\nwhat we're talking about,\npresumably if this is a real effect,\nand sounds like it might be\nthat there's a compound in tart cherries.\n- That's right.\n- That if we were to call it,\nwhatever, whatever five\nalpha six, you know,\nsome molecule, if we refer\nto it by its technical name,\nthen people would say,\noh, that sounds like a very\ninteresting technical way\nto approaches sleep\nbut doesn't sound very natural.\nSo both groups are a little bit misguided\nin the sense that people who think that\neverything that comes from\nnaturally occurring foods,\nplants, etcetera, things\nthat grow out of the ground,\nthat that's all safe, that's not true.\nAnd people that think that pharmaceuticals\nare the if it's not evidence\nwith the purified molecule,\nthen something's not of utility.\nWell, that's certainly not true.\nsomewhere in the middle,\nI think lies the answer,\nwhich is, it sounds to me like\ntart cherry is at least an\nintriguing potential sleep aid.\nIntriguing potential sleep aid\nand underscoring potential.\nI'm certainly intrigued by it\nto the point where I\nmight experiment a bit,\nbut I'm an experimenter for myself.\nBefore I ask you about kiwi,\nI've had quite good results\nfrom taking something called apigenin,\nwhich is a derivative of chamomile.\nBut in supplement form, I\nthink I take 50 milligrams\nabout 30 minutes before sleep.\nAnd I subjectively experience\na better night's sleep,\nso to speak.\nI don't measure I confess,\nI don't measure my sleep.\nI'm not a sleep tracker guy.\nBut, you know, there are\na few papers out there\nthey're not what we would call blue\npublished in Blue Ribbon journals,\nbut they have control groups,\nand it looks somewhat interesting.\nAnd there when I say apigenin\npeople get somewhat\nintrigued oh this molecule.\nChamomile has long been\nthought to be a sedative,\na mild sedative, but a sedative?\nDo you drink chamomile tea?\nDo you take apigenin?\nWhat are your thoughts on apigenin?\n- Yeah, I don't.\nAnd I have looked into some of the data\nregarding sleep as well.\nRight now from best I can tell\nit's mostly subjective data\nrather than objective hard\nsort of sleep measures.\nAnd that's why right now I you know,\nit's sort of unclear not no\ncomment, but just unclear,\nnot dismissing it,\nbecause I think you and I both ascribe\nto the idea of absence of evidence\nis not evidence of absence.\nSo keep your mind open, at\nleast I tell that to myself.\nI think if you're finding a benefit,\nand you can do what I would think of\nif I was personally experimenting,\nwhich is both the positive and negative\nparts of the experiment, what\nI mean by that is, you know,\nlet's say that I now want to, you know,\nthink about some kind of sleep supplement,\nI will take some kind of\nbaseline set of recordings\nfor a month, and I will\njust gauge where I'm at,\nsort of supplement free.\nThen I'll go on for a month or two,\nwhatever I'm thinking of taking,\nand I don't, you know, supplement.\nBut let's say that I want to\nand I experiment with that.\nAnd I feel as though based on my metrics\nbe them objective from my aura ring\nor be them subjective from\nwhatever I'm, you know,\nwriting down in the morning,\nand both are important and valid,\nsubjective and objective, we\nlike both in the sleep world.\nAnd I think,\nokay, look, it's clearly that it seems\nto have some kind of an effect.\nThe key thing, however, is then\ndo the negative experiment,\nwhich is now come off it\nfor another month, and see,\ndo things get worse.\nAnd if I can see that by directionality,\nthen I'm starting to think\nmaybe I'm believing\nthis a little bit more.\nSo that's the way I would sort of\ntypically approach you know,\na supplementation regiment\nif I were to do it.\nAnd that's just me, that's just\nthe way my mind works, but.\n- No, that's great.\nI think it's very scientific and organized\nin a way that allows you\nand would allow other people\nto make very informed\ndecisions for themselves.\nI like that.\nI like to think in terms of manipulating\nany aspect of our biology,\nthat behavioral tools always\nare the first line of entry,\nthen nutrition, everyone\nhas to eat sooner or later,\neven if you're fasting,\nthen perhaps supplementation,\nthen prescription drugs,\nand then perhaps brain machine interface,\ndevices that you use to induce something.\nAnd those can be done in combination.\nBut what concerns me is\nwhen I hear people say,\nwell, what should I take\nwithout thinking about their behavior,\ntheir light viewing behavior, etcetera.\nBut of course, these\nthings work in combination.\n- And I think it's, you're right,\nthat there's many when it comes to sleep,\nthere are many low hanging fruits\nthat don't necessarily\nrequire you to, you know,\nput sort of exogenous molecules\nin other words things like\nsupplements into your body\nor, you know, use different types of drugs\nto help you get there.\nNow, when it comes to\nprescription sleep aids,\nI think I've been again a\nlittle bit too forthright.\nWe know in clinical practice\nthat there may be a time\nand a place for things\nlike sleeping pills,\nthey are a short term solution\nto certain forms of insomnia,\nbut they are not recommended\nfor the long term.\nAnd we also know that there\nare lots of other ways\nthat you can get a sleep help\nor you can get a sleep curative profile\nfrom things like cognitive\nbehavioral therapy for insomnia,\nwhich is a non drug\napproach, psychological.\n- And quite effective from\nwhat I understand, good data.\n- Just as effective as\nsleeping pills, great data\nmore effective in the long term.\nThere's a recent study published that\nafter working with a therapist,\nsome of the benefits lasted\nalmost a decade, you know,\nnow, if you stop sleeping pills,\nusually you have rebound insomnia,\nwhere your sleep goes back to being\njust as bad if not worse.\nAnd I think the same is true,\nwhen we think about supplementation,\nthere are so many things\nthat are easy to implement\nwhen it comes to sleep,\nthat don't require venturing\nout into those waters.\nAnd again, we're not here to tell anyone\nabout whether they should venture or not,\nthat's completely your choice.\nAll I'm saying is that if\nyou want to think about\noptimizing your sleep,\nthere are a number of ways\nthat you can do it that don't necessarily\nrequire you to swallow\nanything or inject anything\nor you know, smoking or\nanything, or free base.\n- And of which the margins of\nsafety are quite quite wide.\nThat's the other one.\n- Yes, right thank you.\nSo speaking of low hanging fruit,\nI don't know how it hangs in reality,\nbut what about kiwi?\nThey're delicious to me anyway.\n- Yeah, the humble kiwi fruit\nnamed not shouldn't be mistaken\nfor the flightless bird of New Zealand,\nwhich is the native bird there.\nWe're talking about the\nkiwi the fruit here,\nwhich those trees and shrubs\nare mostly South East Asia.\nKiwi fruits have been previously touted\nas potentially having a sleep benefit,\nwhich again got me curious\nand I at first threw it out.\nTo my knowledge, there's really only one\npublished human study that's of any value.\nBut what they did find was that\nit decreased the speed of time\nwith which it took you to fall asleep.\n- These are you ingesting the whole kiwi.\nSo it's ingesting the whole kiwi.\n- With the skin, I eat the skin,\npeople cringe when they see\nme, or don't eat the skin?\n- Well, I think, no, no, no,\nI think the idea is some of the good stuff\nand I'll come on to this may\nactually be in the skin itself.\n- Oh wonderful, thank you.\nYou just helped me win a bet.\nI'll give you your cut.\n- Okay, okay, yeah, you can pay me later.\nBy the way this skin is use?\nNo, no, no.\nHe just told me to say that's how he wins,\nno, he did not.\nSo the skin seems to be part of this\npotential sleep equation.\nAnd that study, you fell asleep faster\nand you stayed asleep for longer\nand you spent less time\nawake throughout the night.\nAnd I just thought,\nwell, you know, that's one study,\nwhat can you really do with that?\nThere was another study,\nhowever, in an animal model,\nwhich is, you know, a\nlittle bit more interesting.\nAnd once again, they found\na very similar phenotype\nthat the rats, sorry they were mice,\nthe mice fell asleep faster.\nAnd they also spent longer time in sleep.\nThe sleep duration also increased.\nWhat was also interesting mechanistically\nand this is not the mechanism\nthat I think ties together\ntart cherries, kiwi fruit,\nand you know things like melatonin,\nbecause I think there could be\none common binding mechanism.\nWhat they found in the animal study\nis that they could block\nthose kiwifruit sleep benefits\nusing a GABA blocking agent.\nNow GABA which stands for\nGamma Amino Butyric Acid\nis one of the major\ninhibitory neurotransmitters\nof the brain.\nIt's kind of like the red.\n- So a naturally occurring\nsedative, sort of?\n- Yeah, it's the kind of the red light\non the traffic light signal, you know,\nothers are green light.\nGABA is red light.\nSo by playing around with\nsome sort of clever drugs\nto manipulate the system,\nthey could prevent the\nbenefit of the kiwi fruit\nby sort of buggering around\nwith the GABA receptor,\nmeaning that perhaps part of\nthe kiwi fruit benefit on sleep\nwas mediated by the brain's natural\ninhibitory neurotransmitter\nsystem called the GABA system.\n- That's exciting.\n- And I thought\nthat that was kind of,\nthat convinced me a little bit more\nthat maybe there's\nsomething here to read into.\nSo to be determined,\nagain, here is the banner,\nbut you know, tart\ncherries and kiwi fruits\nthe data surprised me,\nbecause in part I was so\npreoccupied with being you know,\nI don't know a bit pure-ish about\nand a bit snobby thinking come on,\nthat's definitely not going to work,\nwell the data certainly found out.\n[cross talking]\n- I look forward to a day\nwhen supplements are no\nlonger called supplements,\nbecause at the end of the day,\nwhether or not something has an effect,\nwhether or not it's a whole kiwi fruit\nor a derivative of kiwi fruit\nwill depend on the molecular compound.\nAnd as you mentioned,\nthis potential mechanism\nvia the GABA system,\nwe both as scientists get\nexcited about mechanism\n'cause when you can trace\na mechanism and a pathway\nit provides a rationale\na grounding for why\nkiwi of all things or\ntart cherry of all things\nmight help increase total sleep time.\nI'd be remiss if I didn't mention\nor ask about tryptophan and serotonin.\nI can anecdotally say,\nwhen I've taken tryptophan,\nthe precursor to serotonin,\nor serotonin itself,\nI have a horrendous night's sleep.\nI fall asleep very easily.\nAnd I experience\nridiculously vivid dreams.\nNeither pleasant nor unpleasant\nis kind of a mishmash.\nAnd then I wake up\nand I experience several days of insomnia.\nThat and I've done the positive control\nand the negative control\nand all the variations\nthere of to confirm that,\nat least for me supplementing\nwith serotonergic agents\nis a bad idea for me.\nAnd tryptophan is a\ncommon sleep supplement\nand sleep aid that's discussed.\nThe normal architecture of sleep involves\nthe release of serotonin,\nbut in a very timed and regulated way.\nWhat are your thoughts\nabout serotonin in sleep?\nIf you had to kind of\nput that into a nutshell.\nAnd then why supplementing with serotonin\nand or its precursor, tryptophan\nmight be a good or a\nbad idea for somebody.\n- I think one of the potential dangers\nis that based on what's\ngoing on in your body,\nthat can change the absorption\nof natural sort of tryptophan\nand serotonin uptake\nwithin the brain itself.\nSo I'm always thoughtful\nwhen you're playing around\nwith that mother nature\ndynamic as it were.\nThe data as you described is\na little bit all over the map.\nSome people say that it knocks them out\nother people say just like you do,\nit has a terrible impact on my sleep.\nAnd when I stop, it's pretty\nbad for a couple of days,\nit seems to have this\nlingering after effect.\nI think what could be happening here is\nwe need serotonin to\njust as you described,\nto be modulated in very specific ways\nduring the different stages of sleep.\nIf you look at the firing\nof the brain epicenters\nwhere serotonin is released,\nand there's a bunch of\nthem in the brainstem,\nwhat you find, and the\nrelease of serotonin too,\nwhen we're awake, it's usually\nin high concentrations,\nas we start to drift off\nto sleep, it lowers some,\nbut not necessarily dramatically\nas we're going into non REM sleep.\nBut then when we go into REM sleep\nserotonin is shut off.\nThe other, one of the other\nneuromodulators noradrenalin\nalso shut off.\nREM sleep is the only time\nduring the 24 hour period,\nwhere we see noradrenaline and serotonin\nor norepinephrine, completely shut down.\nWhen I say serotonin,\nwe're also talking 5-HTP,\nsorry, 5-HT, that's just\nits chemical name here.\nSo whether it was speaking\nabout serotonin or 5-HT\nis the same thing.\nNorepinephrine, noradrenaline,\nboth of those need to be shut down\nfor you to produce REM sleep.\nThe other, one of the\nother neuromodulators,\nthat then ramps up to produce\nREM sleep is acetylcholine.\nSo these three neuromodulators\nhave this incredible\nreciprocal dance that they have\nfor you to generate what is called\na natural architecture of\nsleep throughout the night.\n- It's the push pull again.\n- It's a push pull again, you know,\nit's you know, it's just and back.\nIt's, you know, whatever\nyou want to think of.\nThat's why I think if\nyou're trying to increase\ndramatically drive up your\nserotonin levels at night,\nand that sustains throughout the night,\nwhen you're trying to get into REM sleep,\nyou could be artificially\nfragmenting REM sleep.\nNow, I don't know the data,\nI don't think anyone's\nreally got the data.\n- No, I haven been able to find it.\n- But that's why I would be,\nyou know if you were to\nsay, Matt, two years time,\nthat's the data helped me\nunderstand the potential mechanism\nor let's design some experiments,\nwhere would you go first?\nI would say let's look at\nthe disruption of REM sleep,\nnon REM sleep, reciprocal regulation,\nbecause, you know, you need\nserotonin to be, you know,\nup at one time down at another, so.\n- I agree with everything you said.\nAnd I'm personally never taking\ntryptophan or serotonin again,\nunless there's some\nclinical reason for that\nthat I would need to do that.\nI want to ask about some\nother pro sleep behaviors.\nBut before I do that,\nlet's talk about naps.\nI love naps.\nI come from a long history of nappers.\nMy dad always took a nap in the afternoon,\nI take a 20 or 30 minute nap\nor I do a practice which I\ntook the liberty of coining\nNSDR, non sleep deep rest,\nsome sort of just passive laying out their\nfeet up elevated.\nSometimes people do you\nor I'll do yoga Nidra,\nI'll do hypnosis or\nsomething of that sort,\nbut 20 or 30 minutes of that\nhas been very beneficial\nfor me to get up from that\nnap or period of minimal\nwakefulness, we'll call it\nand go about my day quite well,\nand also fall asleep just fine.\nWhat are the data on naps?\nDo you nap?\nAnd what are your thoughts\nabout keeping naps short\nmeaning 20 to 30 minutes\nversus getting out\npast 90 minutes, two hours?\nSo for you personally\nnaps, yay, nay or meh?\n- I don't nap.\nAnd I've just never\nbeen a habitual napper.\n- Is that because you don't feel sleepy\nin the afternoon, or because?\n- I typically don't feel sleepy?\n- So you're just hardier then.\n- I am, I wouldn't say hardier,\nI may be less capable of\nfalling asleep, my sleep drive.\n- But you're not dragging\nthrough the afternoon?\n- No, no, I don't drag through out the.\n- So you don't nap because\nyou don't feel a need to nap?\n- That's right, yep.\nNow, it's not that I am immune\nto what we call the\npostprandial dip in alertness.\nI definitely feel as though\nthere can be this kind of afternoon lull,\nwhere, you know, I'm\nnot quite as on as I was\nat 11 o'clock in the morning.\nAnd we know the physiology to that,\nwhich brings us back to whether\nwe were designed to nap.\nSo for naps, we've done\nlots of different studies\nand other colleagues have\ndone these studies too.\nNaps can have some really great benefits,\nwe found benefits for\ncardiovascular health,\nblood pressure, for example,\nwe found benefits for levels of cortisol,\nwe found benefits for learning and memory,\nand also emotional regulation.\n- How long are the naps,\ntypically, in those studies?\n- Anywhere between 20\nminutes to 90 minutes.\nSometimes we like to\nuse a 90 minute window\nso that the participant can\nhave a full cycle of sleep,\nand therefore they get\nboth non REM and REM sleep\nwithin that time period.\nThen when we wake them up,\nwe usually wait a period of time\nto get them past what\nwe call sleep inertia,\nwhich is that kind of window of grogginess\nwhere you say to you,\nbetter half look, you know,\ndarling, please don't\nspeak to me for the first hour after I've.\n- Don't anything right now.\n- After the first hour\nof waking up, you know,\nI'm not just, I'm just not\nthe best version of myself.\nSo we wait for that time period,\nand then we do some testing.\nAnd we've done some\ntesting before and after,\nand we look at the change.\nAnd that's how we measure\nwhat was the benefit of naps\nand the reason why we\nsometimes do 90 minutes\nso that they get all of\nthose stages of sleep.\nAnd then we correlate,\nhow much benefit did you get from the nap,\nand how much of that\nbenefit was explained by\nwhat REM sleep you got,\nwhat deep sleep you got,\nwhat light sleep you got?\nSo that's the only reason that we use that\nas an experimental tool.\nWhat we've also found is that\nnaps of as little as 17 minutes\ncan have some quite potent\neffects on for example, learning.\nNone of this is novel,\nNASA pioneered this back in the 1990s.\nAnd during the missions,\nthey were experimenting with\nnaps for their astronauts.\nAnd what they found was that\nnaps of little as 26 minutes,\nimproved mission performance by 34%,\nand improved daytime alertness by 50%.\nAnd it birthed what was then called\nthe NASA nap culture\nthroughout all terrestrial NASA staff\nduring that time period.\nSo it's long been known that\nnaps can have a benefit.\nNaps, however, can have\na double edged sword\nthere is a dark side to naps.\nAnd it comes back to\nour story of adenosine\nand sleep pressure.\nThe longer we're awake,\nthe more of that sleep pressure\nadenosine that we build up.\nBut what I didn't tell\nyou is that when we sleep,\nthe brain gets the chance\nto essentially clear out that adenosine.\nAnd after about 16 hours of wakefulness,\nand then after about eight hours of sleep,\neight hours of sleep seems to be able to\nallow the brain to decrease\nits adenosine levels\nback to normal.\nAnd so naturally, we\nshould start to wake up\nwhich also aligns with\nyour circadian rhythm.\nAnd those are two separate processes.\nBut with about eight hours\nof good quality sleep\nseven to nine hours for the average adult,\nwe are free of all of that adenosine.\nWe've evacuated it\nessentially out of the brain,\nand we wake up naturally\nfeeling refreshed.\nThe reason that naps can\nbe potentially dangerous\nis that when you nap,\nyou are essentially opening the\nvalve on the pressure cooker\nof sleep pressure.\nAnd some of that sleepiness\nis lost by way of the nap.\nSo for some people and not all people\nand you're a great example of this.\nSome people, however,\nif they are struggling\nwith sleep at night, and\nthey nap during the day,\nit makes their sleep problems even worse.\nSo for people with insomnia,\nwe typically advise against napping.\nAnd the advice is if\nyou can nap regularly,\nand you don't struggle\nwith sleep at night,\nthen naps are just fine.\nBut if you do struggle with\nsleep, stay away from naps.\nIf you are going to nap,\ntry to limit your naps,\ntry to cut them off a bit\nlike sort of caffeine, maybe you know,\neight to 12 hours maybe\nnot that you know far off\nmaybe sort of seven to six\nhours is a good rule of thumb.\nTry not to nap essentially\nlate in the afternoon.\nAnd if you do take a nap\nand you want to maintain your\nyou don't want to have\nthat grogginess hangover\nthat can happen after\na full night of sleep\nfor the first hour,\ntry to limit it to about 20, 25 minutes.\nAnd that way you don't go down\ninto the very deepest stages of sleep,\nwhich if I wrench you\nout of with an alarm,\nthen you just kind of feel\nyou almost feel worse,\nfor the first hour after the nap.\n- I've definitely experienced\nthat if I oversleep.\nCertainly if the sun\ngoes down during my nap\nand I wake up and light overall\nlighting conditions have changed,\nI find it very hard to jolt\nmyself back into the evening.\nAnd it can screw me up.\nSo I try and keep those naps pretty brief.\nAnd I should say,\nI'm very happy to hear you\nmention individual differences\nand why some people might want to nap\nand other people might not want to nap,\nI have a colleague Liqun Luo\nhe'll be familiar to many neurobiologist.\n- Yeah of course.\n- Who's a absolutely\nspectacular scientist,\nmember of the National Academy,\nHoward Hughes investigator just a phenom,\nand has a ton of energy.\nBut years ago, I learned\nthat he always takes a\nnap in the afternoon,\nso much so that when he travels\nto give seminars at other universities,\nhe will tell his post lunch host\nwhoever it is that he's\nsupposed to meet with,\nmay I have your office\nfor 30 minutes of our,\nsometimes 30 minute discussion\nor 60 minute discussion,\nbecause I like to take a nap.\nAnd he does that\nand then gives us his,\nhis talks are typically in the afternoon\nin academic culture.\nAnd he describes the\neffect of the nap for him\nthis short naps in the afternoon\nbeing so profound for his productivity.\nThat's actually what inspired me\nto start feeling okay\nabout my desire to nap.\nAnd so I think for me,\nthat was great vindication for\nthose that might feel guilty\nabout wanting a nap.\nBut I take to heart your note about\navoiding naps if you have trouble falling\nand staying asleep,\n'cause I think that I have family members\nwho also if they nap, they're\na wreck, they can't sleep.\n- Yeah, I think it's just,\nwe've often been very pro sleep\nwith sort of the sleep community.\nSo I think it's good to always point out\nthese potential dark sides of any aspect.\nBut you're absolutely right,\nno one should feel guilty\nabout getting the sleep\nthat they need.\nAnd I think that's been one\nof the big problems in society\nsociety has stigmatized\nsleep with these labels\nof being slothful or lazy.\nAnd we're almost embarrassed, you know,\nto tell colleagues that we take a nap.\nI think sleep is a write of human beings.\nAnd I therefore think that\nsleep is a civil right\nof all human beings.\nAnd no one should make you feel unproud\nof getting the sleep that you need.\n- No, I love that.\nAnd I it's an important point.\nI also feel that one of the best ways\nto beat your competition in any\nendeavor is to outlive them.\nSo now that we know that\nsleep can enhance longevity\nand lack of sleep can shorten one's life,\nthat's all the\njustification I need anyway.\nCan somebody sleep too much?\nIs it possible to get too much sleep?\n- It's a very good question.\nAnd there are probably two\nthings to say about it,\nthere is a condition\nthat we call hypersomnia.\nBut that's a mixture of things,\nit's where people have either\na very high sleep need,\nor they are very sleepy during the day.\nAnd they're typically falling asleep.\nAnd these can happen in a variety\nof different clinical contexts.\nOne of the places where we've often seen\nhypersomnia believed to\nmanifest is in depression.\nBut if you look at some of those studies,\nit turns out, it looks more as though\nthose people are simply\nreporting being in bed longer,\nbut not necessarily sleeping longer.\nAnd that fits very well\nwith one of the profiles\nthat we know of depression,\nwhich is anhedonia,\nyou don't get pleasure from\nnormally pleasurable things.\nSo you just don't want\nto go out into the world,\nyou don't want to interact\nbecause you're depressed.\nSo what do you do?\nYou just stay in bed?\n- Blinds closed, watching\nTV, on the phone.\n- [Matthew] Right, and that\njust looks as though you know,\n- Felling miserable.\n- When people say,\nwhat time did you go to bed?\nAnd what time did you get out of bed?\nThe mistake made in that question is\nokay, that's how much time their sleeping\nwhen you should have said,\nwhat time did you fall asleep?\nAnd what time did you wake up?\nAnd the answer could be very different.\nSo that's hypersomnia\nfrom a clinical context.\nCan you sleep too much though?\nOne of the data points that\nargues yes, that's possible\nis when we look at all cause mortality.\nCertainly what you find is that\nusing the sweet spot\nof seven to nine hours,\nwhen you start to draw below seven hours,\nthere is a relationship, which suggests\nthat the shorter your sleep,\nthe shorter your life.\nShort sleep in that regard\npredicts all cause mortality.\nBut it's again, not a linear relationship\nlike the one that we've\nseen with REM sleep.\nOnce you get past nine hours,\nthe mortality curve stops going down.\nAnd then once you get\nfurther 10 or 11 hours,\nit hooks back up again,\nit's almost like a J shape,\ntilted over a little bit and reversed.\nSo there's this strange\nhook, what's going on here?\nRight now, sleep science has at least\ntwo non mutually exclusive\nexplanations for this.\nThe first is that if you look\nat some of those populations,\nthe idea is that the whatever\nwas causing them illness\nand took their lives was just too much\nfor sleep to deal with.\nHowever, we know that when we get sick,\none of the things that we do immediately\nin this whole mechanism\nand inflammatory mechanisms\ncytokine mediated, when we get sick,\nwe want to sleep more.\nWe just want to curl up in bed\nand you know, sleep it off.\nSo the argument there is that\nit's not that sleep was\nkilling people prematurely,\nit was that these people\nwere calling on this\nthe help of sleep,\nthey were calling on this thing called\nthe Swiss Army Knife of\nhealth, that is sleep.\nBut whatever it is that they were facing\nwas just too powerful\nfor sleep to overcome.\nSo it artificially looks as though\nmore sleep leads to a\nhigher risk of death,\nwhen sleep is actually\nresponding to the mortality risk,\nand it lost the battle.\nThat's one argument.\nThe second is that we\nknow that sleep quality\nand poor sleep efficiency\nis a very strong predictor\nof all cause mortality.\nAnd when you look at\npeople who often report\nsleeping longer amounts,\n10 or 11 hours,\nthey typically report having\nvery poor quality sleep.\nSo because their quality of sleep is poor,\nthey just try to sleep longer\nto try and get some of that back.\nSo again, here now it's poor quality sleep\nmasking as too much sleep\nleading to this artificial hook\nwhich looks like mortality.\nThat's the second explanation.\nA third which is more of a Gedanken,\nwhich is just the kind of\nlike a thought experiment\nand I have this mentality,\nI don't know how many\nother people share this.\nI actually think that could\nbe a thing as too much sleep.\nPhysiologically, I think it's possible.\nBut the reason I think that\nis because it's no different\nthan food, water or oxygen.\nCan you overeat?\nYes, you can.\nCan you under eat?\nOf course.\n- Or light.\nlight in the early part of the day,\nthroughout the day, wonderful.\nLight late in the day and\nat night, detrimental.\n- Bi-directional, you know, for\nwater, can you over hydrate,\nhypernatremia it can lead, you know,\nit happened in the 1990s and\n2000, with the ecstasy craze,\nwhere governments were\nsaying you're dehydrating\nyou're dancing all night,\nplease drink water.\nAnd they drunk too much water,\ntheir blood electrolytes went\nyou know, all over the place,\nand they were having\ncardiac arrests or stroke.\n- Yeah people were dying.\n- And they were dying because\nof excessive hydration.\nCan you get too much oxygen, hypoxemia?\nAnd it can cause free radical damage,\nwhich can be profoundly\nharmful and kill brain cells.\nCan you sleep too much?\nYou know, which is the fifth\nelement of the life equation,\nyou know, alongside you know, food, water,\noxygen, you know, so forth.\nI should say I can't even count.\nClearly I'm sleeping well.\nYes, I think that could\nbe that possibility.\nAre most people in danger\nof getting too much sleep?\nOr contrary, if you look at the data.\nSo but I don't dismiss that idea.\nI think it's possible.\n- That's a very thorough and very nuanced,\nand yet very clear answer.\nSo I, it's so interesting to think that\na lot of the data that's out there\nthat talking about being in bed too long\nthat it's just trying to compensate\nfor the actual fragmentation of sleep.\nSo what I'm coming away with\nis that there are many paths to this\nand both positive and things to avoid.\nBut the idea is to get most nights,\na similar amount, probably\nseven to nine hours,\nsomewhere in there, of high quality sleep.\nThat this notion of sleep\nquality is going to become,\nI would hope, a phrase that\nmore people think about\nand learn about and\ncultivate as a practice.\nI want to ask about a set of behaviors\nthat I'm at least I'm aware\nof at least one company\nis starting to track in their\nsleep monitoring device,\nand that's orgasm, and sex\norgasm and masturbation\ntopics that are, you know,\nare somewhat sensitive.\nBut from the perspective\nof biology, right,\nnone of us would be here were it not for\nsperm meets egg in some fashion,\neither in a dish or in vivo.\nBut what are the data\nas you know them to be\nor maybe your lab is even\ndoing this kind of work\nand exploration about the role\nthat sex, orgasm, masturbation play\nin getting to sleep and staying\nasleep and sleep quality?\nCertainly those behaviors\nand those physiological events\nhave been part of our\nevolutionary history.\nWhat's the story there?\nWhat can we say about\nthis in terms of science\nand dare I say practice?\n- Yeah, I mean, it's almost\nthat caricature of you know,\nin the movies where, you\nknow, a couple makes love\nand then all of a sudden,\nyou just sort of hear snoring\nor, you know, that happens\nwith the idea that it somewhat\nsome neurogenic that it's sleep promoting.\n- Well, the post orgasmic\nincrease in prolactin.\n- Well, that's very, is interesting.\n- Is thought to be a set\na naturally occurring sedative,\nthat presumably has a function in.\n- And oxytocin has that also\nthat benefit where you see, you know,\na dissipation of the\nfight or flight branch\nof the nervous system,\nwhich has to happen\nfor you to fall asleep.\nThat's why we often see, you\nknow, here at The Sleep Center,\nwe'll see a phenomenon\ncalled wired and tired\nwhere people say, look,\nI am so desperately tired\nI just I'm so so tired,\nbut I can't fall asleep,\nbecause I'm too wired.\nSo your sleep drive, you're\ndesperately tired, it's there\nbut because you're wired,\nbecause you've got too much\nsympathetic activation,\ntoo much cortisol as well,\nyou can't fall asleep.\nIt's an impressive roadblock\nto anything like good sleep.\nAnd it's one of the principal mechanisms\nthat we now believe stress\nand physiological activation,\nthat is the underlying cause\nof many forms of insomnia.\nBut coming back to sex,\nthe data is actually quite compelling,\nthat both either subjectively\nassessed sleep quality,\nor objective amount of sleep,\nsex that has resulted in orgasm,\nand I think it's that latter part\nthat typically needs to happen.\n- I would imagine so.\n- That, you know, so between\ntwo mutually exclusive individuals,\nwhere both are, you know, beneficial\nin terms of receiving an orgasm.\n[cross talking]\n- Yeah, I would say any\ndiscussion about sex,\nwe were referring to\nconsensual, age appropriate,\nspecies appropriate, context appropriate.\n- Wow, I would never have even gone\nto the species appropriate.\n- I put species in there\nbecause it's the internet,\nand people will come up\nwith all sorts of ideas.\nSo I think that age appropriate,\nI think age appropriate,\nconsensual, context appropriate\nand species appropriate,\ncovers all the bases,\nbut if I missed any, put\nthem in the comment section,\nand we'll be sure to take note.\n- Yeah, no, I think\nthat's really well said\nand important to say.\nSo the data that is the\nwhen you look at couples\nwho have orgasm.\nWe've also, however, found\nbenefits of masturbation,\nand it's not frequently spoken about.\nBut what if you do some surveys,\nit turns out that people\nwill often use masturbation\nas a sleep tool, if they're\nstruggling with sleep.\nAnd I know, this sort of sounds almost\nlike a strange conversation,\nor it's a taboo conversation\nbut I think we just need to be\nvery open about all of this.\n- I started off in science,\none of the things I worked\non early in my career,\nnot the very first topic\nwas the topic of early\ninfluences of hormones,\nestrogen and testosterone\non sexual development\nof the brain and body.\nAnd when you are weaned\nin a laboratory like that,\nregardless of what era,\nyou look at sex and its\nbehaviors, and its hormones,\nand its physiologies as a scientist,\nand so that's to be clear\nwhat we're doing here,\nwe're exploring these behaviors\nfrom that perspective.\nI mean, one thing is for certain,\neveryone is here because\na sperm met an egg,\neither in a dish or in\nvivo, as we said before,\nand at least in 2021,\nthere's no way around that fact.\nAnd what preceded that is\ntypically this act we call sex\nand sometimes, hopefully, I like to think\norgasm is associated with\nthat sexual activity.\nMasturbation is one dimension of that\nis something that I think it\ncan and should be discussed,\nif in fact, there are data\nthat relate it to sleep.\n- Yeah, and both of those routes\nseem to lead to a sleep benefit.\nNow, I'm not saying that\nit's all about the orgasm.\nI think as we spoke about with oxytocin,\nthere is some degree of par bonding\nthat if you have a partner,\nand you experience you know,\nan intimate loving, you know,\nrelationship that involves that,\nthen you can have hormonal benefits\nthat are sleep promoting,\nthat may not necessarily be seen\nif you're just engaging you know,\nin the solo singular act of masturbation.\nSo what we certainly know\nand I am not someone to take any advice on\nwhen it comes to anything\nrelationship wise or sex wise.\n- That's a different\nepisode of the podcast.\n- Yeah, yeah certainly.\nAnd that's not a podcast series\nthat I'm going to be\nreleasing anytime soon,\nit's going to be mostly about sleep.\nAlthough I will touch on,\nI'll release a podcast on sleep and sex.\nBut that's the data that we have so far.\nWe also know that it\nworks both ways, though.\nAnd it's commonly the same way with sleep.\nYou know, sleep and\nexercise, sleep and diet.\nHow you eat can affect how you sleep,\nhow you sleep can affect how you eat.\nSame with exercise.\nAnd it turns out,\nit's the same way with\nsexual behavior, too.\nSo here, we're talking about\nwhether sex can help with sleep.\nCan sleep help with your\nrelationship and sex?\nAnd the answer is, yes, it can.\nFirstly, we know and we've\nspoken a little bit about this,\nthat the reproductive hormones\nare under profound sleep regulation.\n- Both estrogen and\ntestosterone, I understand.\n- Estrogen, testosterone, as I said.\n- Cause we hear so often\nabout testosterone.\nBut women who, or I should\nsay anyone who's interested\nin having higher levels of estrogen\nor normal healthy levels of estrogen\nI presume the data show for estrogen\nwhat the data also show,\nsimilarly for testosterone.\nWhich is if you get too little\nor poor quality of sleep\nboth sex steroid hormones,\nas they're referred to\ntestosterone and estrogen,\nwhich are present in\nboth males and females\nand every variation thereof,\nare going to be diminished below\nnormal healthy levels, correct?\n- Yes, estrogen,\ntestosterone, FSH in women,\na key hormone in the regulation for,\nkey for conception, of course,\nall of these sex hormones\nseem to become significantly disrupted\nwhen sleep becomes of short\nquantity, or poor quality.\nWe also know that in women,\nsleep disruption can usually lead\nto menstrual cycle disruption.\nWe know this, particularly from evidence\nin shift working women\nwhere they are nighttime shift workers,\nthey struggle with sleep during the day,\noften menstruation is disrupted\nor even becomes impaired.\nBut we also know it works this way,\nnot just for sex hormones,\nbut for sex itself.\nFor example, we found that\nfor every one hour of sleep,\nextra sleep that a woman gets\nher interest in becoming sexually\nintimate with her partner\nincreases by 14%, which is, you know,\na non trivial amount.\n- Substantial.\n- And then the final part\nof I think this equation\nwhen it comes to sleep, and sex\nis your relationship itself.\nAnd there's some great\nwork here from UC Berkeley\nby Professor Serena Chen.\nAnd what she found was\nthat restless nights\nmean for far more brutal\nfights in your relationship.\nAnd they did this.\n- And vice versa.\n- A number of different elegant ways,\nand vice versa as well.\n- I mean, not that I've ever\nhad conflict in relationships.\n[cross talking]\n- You know, just this is data I've read,\nI've never experienced that at all.\nSo, they found reliably\nthat sleep would predict\nhigher likelihood of\nrelationship conflict.\nSecondly, if you got into that conflict,\nthe chances of you resolving it\nwere significantly lower when the parties\nhad not been sleeping well.\nPart of the reason is because\nwhen you are not well slept,\nyour empathy goes down.\nSo you're not, you're taking more of an\nabrasive stance with your partner,\nrather than a more agreeable\nstance with your partner.\nSo at almost every dimension\nof a human loving relationship,\nsleep can have a dramatic impact.\n- I think these are really\nimportant things to underscore,\none of the most common questions I get,\nbecause there seems to\nbe community of people\non the internet that\nare obsessed with this.\nI don't know who they are,\nbecause it's all,\nall this internet stuff\nis shouting into a tunnel\nand getting comments back in written form.\nIt's a very bizarre\nconversation, so to speak.\nIs whether or not sexual behavior itself\nlowers or increases testosterone?\nAnd I went into the data,\nwhich spans many decades actually,\nboth animal studies and human studies.\nAnd it seems just to underscore this\nas long as we're talking\nabout this subject\nthat it does seem that sexual activity,\nsex between two people\ndoes seem to increase\ntestosterone in both.\nThere is this question\nabout orgasm or no orgasm\nejaculation, no ejaculation and indeed,\nthere do seem to be some effects of\nrestricting ejaculation in males\nas a form of further\nincreasing testosterone.\nSo sex without ejaculation\nfurther increasing testosterone.\nBut the data are not clean.\nPresumably because organizing\nthese sorts of studies\nand getting truth in self reporting\nis probably hard to get from subjects.\nBut everything sort of\npoints in the direction\nthat provided that the\nrelationship is a healthy one,\nit's consensual, it's age appropriate,\ncontext appropriate, species appropriate\nthat sex between two individuals\ndoes seem to increase\nthe sex steroid hormones\ntestosterone and estrogen\ntoward healthy ranges.\nAnd what I'm hearing now\nthis sort of Gestalt of the discussion\nwe just had is that\nthat too can promote\nsleepiness, restful states,\nand quality sleep.\nAnd I think this is an\nimportant conversation\nthat just hasn't been held enough.\nI mean, sooner or later,\nboth in the US and elsewhere,\nwe're going to have to acknowledge\nthat we are biological\norganisms of some sort,\nand that we have choice in life,\nabout all these things,\nfrom supplementation to\nsex, or no sex, et cetera,\nbut that they have profound\neffects on our core biology.\nI mean, it's fascinating to me\nthat the areas of the\nhypothalamus, the preoptic area,\nthe super optic areas,\nthose areas which the names\nmight not mean anything to anybody,\nbesides Matt and I sitting here,\nbut those areas sit cheek\nto jowl with each other\nin the hypothalamus and\ncontrol, sleep and sex.\nThe trigger of orgasm,\nthe appetite for food,\nthe appetite for water for electrolytes.\nI mean, the hypothalamus\nis kind of a festival\nof neurons with different booths\nfor different primitive behaviors.\n- It's such a small, small\nstructure in the brain,\nbut it's the orchestrator of\na vast number of our behaviors\ndisproportionate in terms\nof its size versus effect.\n- Yeah, I don't think you can\ngo to this hypothalamic festival\nwithout at least seeing all the booths\nwhether or not you decide\nto visit them or not.\n- I love that master analogy.\n- So I'm glad that we've\nbroached that conversation.\nAnd I hope people will think\nthat we've approached it\nwith the appropriate level of sensitivity.\nIt's an important one that\nwe're going to hear more about\none way or the other.\nPeople are certainly thinking about this,\nif not engaging in\nthese sorts of behaviors\nor avoiding them.\nSo the more we can understand\nabout the biology, the better.\nAnd so thank you for\nbringing that topic up.\nBecause for the record, Matt,\ntabled it for discussion.\n- We were just like chatting outside\nand I think we said\nsomething about sort of sex,\nand I said we can go there.\nThere is so much interesting data.\n- Absolutely, I want to touch\non just two remaining topics.\nOne is are there any\nunconventional sleep tips\nor things about sleep\nthat we've overlooked?\nIf we've covered everything\ngreat, but you know,\nwe hear to keep the room cool.\nWe hear because of this\ntemperature phenomenon,\nthe light aspects, the\nconsiderations about alcohol,\nCBD marijuana, cognitive behavioral,\ntart cherry fruit, kiwi perhaps.\n- Please don't put me on the hook\nfor tart cherries and kiwis,\nI was just offering what\nI know about the data.\n- And these are considerations\nand whether or not people\nbatch these things,\nI won't even list them off now,\nbecause they're too many\njokes that one could make.\n- And I have no affiliation\nwith any of these products.\n[cross talking]\n- Well, I'm going to take\nout stock in a kiwi company.\nNo I'm just kidding.\nBut the question I have is about\nany unconventional or lesser known things,\nor maybe you do things\nor you think about things\njust in a purely exploratory way,\nas a scientist of that, you\nknow, the what if kind of things\nthat, yeah, what if it turns out that\nand I hear I just,\nI got a blank there for you to fill in.\n- I think, you know, beyond\nthe standard, you know,\nfair that I've dished out plenty of times\nof sleep hygiene of you know,\nregularity, temperature,\ndarkness, alcohol, caffeine,\nand we've spoken about all of those.\nWhat are some more\nunconventional tips, I guess?\nThe first one, which is unconventional\nalong the lines of naps.\nIf you've had a bad night of sleep,\nlet's say that you're starting\nto emerge with insomnia\nand you've had a bad night of sleep,\nthe advice and I learned this\nfrom my wonderful colleague,\nMichael Perlis, do nothing.\nWhat I mean by that is,\ndon't wake up any later,\ndon't sleep in the following\nday to try and make up for it,\ndon't nap during the day,\ndon't consume extra\ncaffeine to wake you up,\nto try to get you through the day,\nand don't go to bed any earlier\nto think that you're going to compensate.\nAnd I can explain all of those things.\nBut if you wake up later,\nyou're not going to be sleepy\nuntil late in the evening,\nso you're going to go to\nbed at your normal time\nand you won't be sleeping,\nyou'll think well,\nI just came off a bad night of sleep.\nAnd now I still,\nI can't even get to sleep\nand it's my normal time.\nIt's because you slept in\nlater than you would otherwise,\nand you reduce the window\nof adenosine accumulation\nbefore your normal bedtime.\nSo don't go,\ndon't wake up any later.\nDon't use more caffeine for\nthe reasons that are obvious,\nbecause that's only going to\ncrank you and keep you awake\nthe following night\nor decrease the probability\nof a good following\nnight of recovery sleep.\nThird, I mentioned don't take naps,\nbecause once again, that\nwill just take, you know,\nnaps, particularly later in the afternoon,\nI almost liken them to\nsnacking before a main meal,\nit just takes your appetite off the edge\nof that main meal of\nsleep, so don't do it.\nAnd then finally, don't\ngo to bed any earlier,\nresist and resist and go\nto bed at your normal time.\nWhat I want to try and do is prevent you\nfrom thinking I had such\na bad night last night\nand I normally go to bed at 10:30,\nI'm just going to get\ninto bed at nine o'clock,\nbecause last night was just so bad.\nBut that's not your natural bedtime,\nand it's not aligned with\nyour natural chronotype\nbecause presumably you kind of know\nsomething about that,\nour morning time, evening time,\nyou're trying to sleep in harmony,\nwhich is usually how you\nget best quality sleep.\nBut you go to bed at nine,\nand my body is not ready\nto sleep at nine o'clock.\nBut I'm worried because I had\na bad night of sleep last night\nso I get into bed,\nand now I'm tossing and turning\nfor the first hour and a half\nbecause it's not my natural sleep window,\nbut I just thought it was a good idea.\nAnd if I didn't know anything about sleep,\nI would think all of\nthese same things too.\nSo I'm not finger wagging.\nBut after if I have a bad night of sleep,\nand I am not immune,\njust because I know a\nlittle bit about sleep\ndoesn't mean I don't\nhave my bad nights, I do.\nDoesn't mean I haven't had\nbouts of insomnia in my life, I have.\nBut after a bad night\nof sleep, I do nothing.\nI don't do any of those four things.\nI think the second tip I would offer\nin terms of unconventional\nis have a wind down routine.\nMany of us think of sleep\nas if it's like a light switch,\nthat we just jump into bed,\nand when we turn the light out\nsleep should arrive in that same way.\nJust the binary you know\nit's on or it's off.\nSleep is a physiological process,\nit's much more like landing a plane,\nit takes time to gradually descend down\nonto the terra firma\nof what we call good solid sleep at night.\nFind out whatever works for you\nand it could be light stretching,\nI usually meditate for about\n10 or 15 minutes before bed.\nSome people like reading,\ntry not to watch television in bed\nthat's usually advised against.\n- Something that doesn't emit\ntoo much light to your eyes.\n- Too much light, too\nactivating, you know,\nyou can listen to relaxing podcasts,\nalthough we can speak about\ntechnology in the bedroom too.\nBut have some kind of a wind down routine.\nIt's you know, it's almost like you know,\nyou wouldn't race into your garage\nand come to a screeching\nhalt from 60 miles an hour,\nyou typically down, shift your gears\nand you slow down as you\ncome into the garage,\nthat's the same thing with with sleep too.\nSo that's the second thing,\nhave some kind of a wind down routine,\nfind what works for you.\nMaybe it's taking a hot\nbath or a warm shower,\nand then stick to it.\nJust we do this with kids all the time,\nwe find out what their bedroom,\nsorry, their bedtime regiment is\nand then we just stick to it faithfully\n'cause we humans are the same way too.\nThe third thing is a\nmyth, don't count sheep.\nThere's a study done here at UC Berkeley,\nI didn't do this today, I wish I did,\nit's by my colleague,\nProfessor Allison Harvey.\nAnd they found that counting sheep\nactually made it harder to fall asleep.\nIt made matters worse.\nAs a conter sorry counter measure to that\nwhat they did find was\nthat taking yourself\non some kind of a mental walk,\nso think about a nice walk\nthat you take in nature\nor a walk on the beach,\nor even a walk around\nan urban environment.\n- Just visualizing that.\n- And visualizing that, that\nseemed to be beneficial.\nThe other thing about sort of that idea\nof shifting focus away\nfrom your mind itself,\nget your mind off itself\nis a good piece of advice.\nCatharsis, you can try to write down\nall of the concerns that you have,\nand do this not right before bed,\nbut usually an hour or two before bed.\nSome people call it a worry journal.\nAnd to me, it's a little\nbit like closing down\nall of the emotional tabs on my browser.\nBecause if I shut the computer down\nand all of those tabs are still open,\nI'm going to come back in the morning,\nand the computer's red hot\nthe fans going because\nit didn't go to sleep,\nbecause it couldn't\nbecause there were too\nmany tabs active and open.\nI think it's the same\nway with sleep as well,\nso try to think about doing that.\nSo just vomit out all of\nyour concerns on the page.\n- I like that, cause my 3am waking\nis often associated with me writing down\nthe list of things that I\nforgot to do that I need to do.\nAnd once I eventually wake\nup from the later night,\nsecond half of the night's sleep,\nthat stuff seems much more\ntractable and reasonable,\nbut it sure would be great\nto get that stuff out\nof the way before sleep.\n- Well, there's also something that\nI don't think people\nhave spoken about a lot.\nAnd I'd like to research it,\nwhich is difficulty and\nanxiety at night in the dark,\nis not the same difficulty and\nanxiety in the light of day.\nAnd when we have those thoughts at night,\nit comes with a magnitude of rumination\nand catastrophization\nthat is disproportionate\nto that which you would\ndescribe when you are awake.\nAnd I don't know what's\ngoing on about the brain,\nand thought and emotion at the time,\nI've got a bunch of theories as to why,\nand that's why I like\nthe idea of closing up\nzipping up all of those\ndifferent components,\njust get them out on the page.\nAnd it feel,\nand I at first thought this\njust sounds like who its\nit sounds very Berkeley,\nit's kind of Kumbaya,\nwe all hold hands, and, you know,\nwe all come at the end of the day.\nBut then the data started coming out\nreally good studies from good people.\nAnd they found that keeping\none of those journals\ndecreased the time it\ntakes you to fall asleep\nby 50%, five, zero.\n- Amazing that's substantial.\n- That's well on par\nwith any pharmaceutical agent.\n- I'm convinced that I've\nlong thought that the\nworries and concerns and\nideas I have at three, 4am\nI've learned to not\nplace any stock in them.\nBecause something, I'm glad that you might\ndecide to eventually look\nat this in your laboratory\nbecause I feel like something\nis melted away or altered.\nI suspect it's in the regulation\nof the autonomic nervous system,\nthat it makes sense why\na concern at three, 4am\nought to evoke more of a panic\nsense than a concern sense.\nAnd certainly, that's my experience,\nalthough not, fortunate to not suffer\nfrom full blown panic attacks.\nBut everything seems worse at three, 4am\nprovided you're awake.\n- And we need to sort of look into that\nbecause, you know, if you\nlook at suicide rates,\naround the 24 hour clock face,\ndisproportionately higher rates\nin those middle sort of night hours.\nSo now, I don't know if\nthat's causative or not,\nbut something you know,\nit could just be that that's the time\nwhen we're mostly lonely,\nand we're by ourselves.\nAnd that's the reason.\nSo it's got nothing to do\nwith sleep or the night time,\nI don't know.\nSo that's the third thing,\nI think the fourth sort\nof little tip I would give\nthat's unconventional,\nis remove all clock faces\nfrom your bedroom.\n- Including your phone.\n- Including your phone,\nand resist checking it.\nNow I know and I can\nspeak about the phone too\nthat genie of technology\nis out the bottle.\nAnd it's not going back in anytime soon.\nSo we've got to think a\nscientist and sleep scientist,\nyou know, as to what we do with you know,\nphones in the bedroom.\n- Years ago, I was a\ncounselor at a Summer camp\nI worked with at risk kids\nand there was a phrase\nthat comes to mind here,\nit's be a channel, not a dam.\nBecause when you try and dam\ncertain kinds of behavior,\nphysically dam certain kinds of behavior\nand not morally dam, that too,\nit just creeps over the edge,\nand you get a waterfall.\nSo it has to be a channel.\nThe phone and devices\nhave to be worked with\nand negotiated not eliminated.\n- That's right and you know,\nthink about those mindfully too\nbut clock faces, remove all of those,\nbecause if you are having,\nyou know, a tough night,\nknowing that it's 3:22 in the morning,\nor it's 4:48 in the morning,\ndoes not help you in the slightest.\nAnd it's only going to make\nmatters worse than better.\nSo try to remove all clock faces.\nAnd I think that's one of those other tips\nthat some people have found helpful.\nBut those would be sort of\nsome slightly unconventional,\nI guess more than your stock fare of\nhere are the five tips for\nsleep hygiene tonight, so.\n- Those are terrific sleep tips,\nand several of which, if not all of which\nI'm going to incorporate.\nMatt, this has been an amazing, deep dive\non sleep and it's positive\nand negative regulators.\n- I hope it hasn't been too long.\n- No this has been great.\n- Please cut it down,\nshorten it to, you know,\nthe five minutes of meaningful\nstuff that I offered.\n- Absolutely not, it is chock a block\nfull of valuable takeaways.\nIt's been tremendously fun for me\nto dissect out this\nincredible aspect of our lives\nthat we call sleep with a fellow scientist\nand a fellow public educator.\nI want to say several things.\nFirst of all, we should say\nwhere people can find you\nalthough it shouldn't be\nthat difficult these days.\nYou're a very present on the internet.\n- [Matthew] Unfortunately.\n- For better or for worse.\nI think it's wonderful\nthat you're out there.\nLook, it's a public health\nservice that you're doing.\nNo one requires you or any other scientist\nto get out and share this information.\nMy sense of you knowing you a bit,\nand from following your work very closely\nboth your scientific work in detail\nand your public facing educational work\nis that you very much\nwant the best for people.\nAnd it's an interesting thing\nas a scientist or a clinician,\nto know that the\nthat certain answers exist,\nthat we don't have all the answers,\nbut that there is a better path,\nthere are better ways\nand people can benefit\nin a myriad of ways.\nSo, for that, because I know\nthat to be very genuine in you,\nyou want the best for people\nand you're offering tremendous advice\nand considerations and people\ncan take it or leave it\nthat's the way I view it.\nI also want to thank you for\ntaking the time out of your day\nto sit with me here and\nhave this discussion.\n- Not at all, no at all, it's a privilege,\nit's a delight, you know, you and I,\nI think we're alike kind in lots of ways.\nAnd I take you as a shining example\nof how you can effectively\nconnect with the public.\nAnd I know that we've had\nour conversations before\nwe ever sat down to talk\ntogether about, you know,\nhow to think about\ncommunicating with the public\nand the pros and cons of that.\nAnd I've just loved your opinions.\nI've been drinking it all in.\nAnd then I think the third\nthing I'd like to say is,\nthank you for being such an\nincredible sleep ambassador,\nthe series that you've released on sleep,\nthe way that you speak about sleep,\nthe way that you moderate\nand have championed sleep.\nIt is remarkable.\nSo thank you for just being you know,\na brother in arms in that way.\n- But we are and thanks\nfor those those words.\n99% of what I discussed there\nwas the work of you and your\ncolleagues in the sleep field.\nSo proper acknowledgement, but thank you,\nwhere can people learn more about\nwhat you're doing currently?\nAnd what's coming next?\nYou're on Twitter.\n- I am on Twitter I typically tweet.\n- As the sleep diplomat.\n- So, no it's just sleep diplomat\n- Sleep diplomat on Twitter.\n- Sleep diplomat on Twitter,\nsleepdiplomat.com website,\nif you want to learn more about\nthe science that we do here,\nit's humansleepscience.com.\nIt's the Center for Human Sleep Science.\nYou can pick up a copy\nof the book, if you want.\nIt's called \"Why We Sleep?\"\nif you're curious about sleep,\nthat's one path to take and it's my view.\n- Is there another might\nsomeday in the future?\n- I think there may be, yeah.\n- Great, great, many,\nmany millions of people\nwill be very happy to hear that.\n- I think it's starting to take hold.\nAnd then as we discussed,\nI am more than kicking around the idea\nof a short form podcast\nrather than a long form,\nnot long form, because I\ndon't have the mental capacity\nor the interviewing, just capability\nthat someone like you has.\nSo it will probably just\nbe monologue short form.\nSo if there is some interest,\nI'll probably do that as well.\nSo those are the ways\nthat people can find me.\nBut overall, if you're\ninterested in sleep,\njust listen to Andrew.\nThat's thing I can tell people.\n- All right, well now\nwe're bating back and forth\nthe vector of action so to speak,\nbut I do hope you'll start a podcast\nhowever brief or lengthy\nthese episodes turn out to be\nbecause I do believe that's a great venue\nto get information out into the world.\nAnd we don't just want to\nhear more from Matt Walker,\nI speak for many people,\nwe need to, the work you're\ndoing is both influential,\nbut more importantly,\nit is important work.\nIt has the impact that's needed,\nespecially in this day and age\nwhere science and medicine, public health,\nand the issues of the world, etcetera,\nare really converging.\nSo I know I speak on behalf\nof a tremendous number of people,\nwhen I just say thank you\nfor doing the work you do\nand for being you.\n- [Matthew] Thank you.\n- And thanks for being a good friend.\n- Likewise, too and by the way,\nI'm just going to note\nthat it was nice that the two of us\nboth got the Johnny Cash memo\nabout how to dress today.\nIt seems as though we're both\nkind of we got that same memo,\nwhich will mean nothing to\npeople who are listening,\nbut if you're watching the video,\nyou'll probably see what I mean.\nAndrew, thank you for taking this time.\nThank you so much.\n- Thanks so much Matt.\nThank you for joining me for my discussion\nwith Dr. Matt Walker.\nPlease also check out his\npodcast the Matt Walker podcast.\nA link to

supplements don't contain\nwhat's listed on the bottle.\nWe therefore have partnered with Thorne,\nthat's T H O R N E, Thorne supplements,\nbecause Thorne supplements\nhave the highest levels of stringency\nin terms of the purity of the ingredients,\nand precision with respect to\nwhat's listed on the bottle\nis actually what's contained\nin those supplement bottles.\nIf you'd like to see the\nsupplements that I take for sleep,\nand for other things, you can\ngo to thorne.com/u/huberman\nand there you'll see all\nthe supplements that I take\nand can get 20% off any\nof those supplements\nas well as any other supplements\nthat Thorne happens to make.\nThat's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd last, but certainly not least,\nthank you for your interest in science."
