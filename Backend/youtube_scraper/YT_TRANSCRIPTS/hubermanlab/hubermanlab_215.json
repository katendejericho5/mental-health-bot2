    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na professor of neurobiology\nand ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we continue in our\ndiscussion about sensation\nor how we sense things.\nOn previous episodes, we\ntalked about sensing light\nand sound waves for things\nlike vision and hearing.\nToday, we are going to\ntalk about our sense\nof self or what's called interoception.\nInteroception is our sensing\nof our internal landscape,\nthings like our heartbeat,\nour breathing, and our gut,\nhow full our gut might happen\nto be, or how empty our\ngut might happen to be.\nBut also our inner landscape\nwith respect to chemistry,\nhow acidic, or how good or\nbad we feel on the inside.\nThis discussion about sense\nof self and interoception\nhas many important,\nactionable items that relate\nto bodily health and brain health,\nand believe it or not,\nour ability to perform well\nor perform poorly in life.\nIndeed, it has profound influence\non our rates of healing.\nSo today we are going to talk\nabout all the aspects of our\ninner landscape and how our\nbrain and body communicate.\nAnd there will be many\nactionable protocols\nas we go along that discussion.\nBefore we begin our discussion\nabout sense of self,\nI want to highlight some very\nrecently published research\nfindings that I believe\nare immediately actionable\nand that everybody should be aware of.\nThese are data that were\npublished by my colleague,\nJustin Sonnenberg's laboratory\nat Stanford University School of Medicine,\nand the data were published\nin the Journal Cell,\nwhich is a very high\nstringency cell press journal.\nSo phenomenal data.\nWhat this study showed was\nthat individuals given a high\nfiber diet actually\nexperienced less diversity\nof what's called the gut microbiome.\nThe number of positive or\nhealth promoting bacteria\nin the gut was actually\nreduced by a high fiber diet,\nwhereas individuals that ate just a couple\nof servings of fermented food each day,\nexperience important\nand beneficial increases\nin anti-inflammatory markers.\nAnd that could be traced\nback to improvements\nin the gut microbiome\ndiversity, the diversity\nof bugs, literally little bacteria\nthat live in the gut,\nwhich might sound bad,\nbut they are actually\nvery health promoting.\nI'm going to get into all\nthe details of this study\nlater in the episode,\nbut I just wanted to\nemphasize these findings\nbecause they are immediately actionable.\nI think for most people\ningesting one or two servings\nof fermented food each day is\nreasonable and does not bring\nwith it tremendous costs or\ntremendous inconvenience.\nAnd I think many people are\ningesting high fiber diets\nthinking that that's the best way\nto improve their gut microbiome.\nSo while these data may prove\nto be controversial among the\nfolks out there in the\nnutrition community,\nthat really high fiber diet,\nI want to just emphasize that\nthese data were looked at\nin a very unbiased way.\nThey were done with large scale screens\nof all sorts of inflammatory markers.\nThere was no specific hypothesis going in.\nIt was purely exploratory,\nbut the data are very clear.\nIt doesn't mean you shouldn't\neat fiber doesn't mean\nthat fiber is bad,\nbut it really shows that\neating fermented foods,\njust one or two servings a day,\nand maybe even ramping up to\nthree or four servings per day\ncan be very beneficial for\nmany aspects of health.\nBefore we go any further.\nI'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles\nat Stanford, it is however,\npart of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Roka.\nRocha makes sunglasses\nand eyeglasses that are of the\nabsolutely highest quality.\nThe company was founded by\ntwo All-American swimmers\nfrom Stanford and everything\nabout their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses is developed\nwith performance in mind.\nI've spent my career\nworking on the visual system\nand its various functionings\nwithin the brain and within the eye,\nRoka sunglasses and\neyeglasses are so phenomenal\nbecause they allow the visual system\nto do what it does best,\nwhich is to adjust to changes\nin what we call luminance\nor brightness, with many\nsunglasses out there\nand with many eyeglasses as well,\nif the brightness in the room changes\nor you get cloud cover, or you walk\ninto a shadow, you have to\ntake the glasses on or off,\nyou can't see as well.\nBut the folks at Roka really understand\nhow the visual system works.\nAnd so they've designed their sunglasses\nand eyeglasses such that you\nnever experienced that shift.\nYou can walk into a shadow.\nThe amount of sunlight can change.\nYou can go into a dark room, et cetera,\nprovided there's enough\nlight to see you're going\nto see everything crystal clear.\nIn addition you see\neverything crystal clear\nbecause the lens quality is terrific\nand the sunglasses and\neyeglasses are very lightweight.\nSo you don't even notice\nthat they're on your face.\nAlso the sunglasses and eyeglasses\nare designed for performance.\nYou can use them while\nrunning or while cycling.\nEven if you sweat, they\nwon't slip off your face.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nthey're very lightweight.\nSo everything about\nthese glasses is terrific\nand they have a terrific aesthetic.\nThey have a lot of different\nstyles to select from.\nAnd unlike a lot of performance\neyeglasses out there,\nthey won't make you look like a cyborg.\nYou could wear them to\ndinner or to somebody's home.\nAnd they look really nice.\nIf you'd like to try Roka glasses,\nyou

by Inside Tracker.\nInside Tracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better meet your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done for\nthe simple reason that many of\nthe factors that impact your\nimmediate and long-term\nhealth can only be assessed,\ncan only be measured from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof quality DNA tests,\nyou can get further insight\ninto the status of your\nimmediate and long term health.\nOne of the problems with a\nlot of blood and DNA tests\nthat are out there, however,\nis you get the numbers back,\nyou get the levels of\nmetabolic factors, hormones,\net cetera, but you don't\nget any information about\nwhat to do with those numbers\nor how to actually shift them\nin the direction that you want to.\nWith Inside Tracker, they have\nthis very easy to use dashboard\nand that dashboard makes\nit very clear, not just\nwhat your levels of\nhormones, et cetera are,\nbut what actions to take in\nterms of nutrition or exercise\nor other lifestyle factors\nto bring those numbers\ninto the appropriate ranges for you.\nIf you'd like to try inside tracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get 25% off any\nof Inside Trackers plans.\nJust use the code Huberman at checkout.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInside Trackers plans.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app\nthat's backed by 25 peer\nreviewed published studies\nand has over 600,000 five-star reviews.\nI started meditating\nwhen I was in my teens,\nbut for many years I found it\nhard to maintain a meditation\npractice, I don't think\nI'm alone with that.\nI think many people start meditating.\nThey'll do it for a few\nweeks or a few months,\nor maybe even a year.\nAnd then they'll give up\nthe meditation practice.\nAnd we know from so many\npeer reviewed studies that\nmeditation has a number of\nvery positive effects on our\nbrain health, our ability to\nfocus and our bodily health.\nSo it's a great thing, we\nprobably should all be doing it,\nbut most of us, including myself,\nhave found it hard to stick\nto a meditation practice.\nThen I started using the Headspace\napp and what I found is I\ncould be very consistent\nwith my meditation practice\nbecause they have\nmeditations that are short,\nmeditation that are medium length,\nand meditations that are a bit longer,\nall of which benefit me.\nThe meditations that they have\nalso are of different styles.\nYou can try different forms of meditation.\nI particularly like having\na guide for my meditation.\nIt just helps me stay focused,\nhelps me stay on track and\nI'm able to derive all those\nregular benefits of meditation\nand keep the practice up\non a regular basis, if\nyou want to try Headspace,\nyou can go to headspace.com/specialoffer.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get a one month totally free trial.\nAnd with that, you'll get all\nof Headspace's meditations, the\nfull library of meditations.\nYou just go to\nheadspace.com/special offer,\nand you get all of their\nmeditations for one free month\nand you get to try it, if you\ndon't like it, you can stop.\nBut I think you will enjoy it.\nI certainly enjoy meditation\nand we know that it's very\nbeneficial for all of us.\nIf you're somebody who cares\nabout your immediate and long-term health,\nand if you're somebody who's\ninterested in performance\nof any kind in work in\nrelationships, et cetera,\ntoday's topic I believe\nis among the more important ones for you.\nOf all the topics I could cover,\nthis thing that we call sense of self,\nwhich is also called\ninteroception has perhaps the most\nfoundational level of\nimportance for all that.\nWe feel all that we do and all\nthat we are capable of doing.\nIn fact I will go so far as to say\nthat interoception or our ability\nto sense our inner real estate\nis right there next to sleep.\nAnd perhaps one other feature\nof our health and bodily\nfunction that primary early\ndetermine how good we feel\nin the now in the short\nterm, and in the longterm,\nand sets the stage for everything\nwe are capable of doing.\nAnd if we don't take care of this thing\nthat we call interoception,\njust like if we don't take care of sleep,\nwe cannot perform well and\nwe will not remain healthy.\nInteroception and sense of\nself are essentially the same\nthing, I will use those\nterms interchangeably,\nat least for sake of today's discussion.\nAnd I promise that if you\ncan learn a little bit\nabout the mechanisms of self sensing,\nof understanding what's going\non in your internal milieu,\nas we say your internal environment,\nyou will position yourself\nto do some very simple things\nthat can lead to outsize positive effects\non everything from sleep\nto body composition,\nto mental focus, to mood, your\nability to regulate stress,\nand indeed even your ability\nto heal and recovery from\ninjuries of different kinds,\nbrain injury and bodily injury.\nSo sense of self is absolutely crucial.\nIt's sometimes called our sixth sense,\nright alongside the other five\nsenses like hearing vision,\ntouch, taste, smell, et cetera,\nbut sense of self is different.\nSense of self is really about what's going\non internally within the\nconfines of our skin.\nAnd it involves two key features\nthat if you can understand\nthose features, and you\nunderstand what modulates\nor changes, our ability\nto sense those features,\nthere are a lot of things that you can do\nin terms of how you structure\nyour nutritional practices,\nhow you relate to your exercise practices,\nperhaps even certain things\nthat you take in terms\nof supplementation that can\nbasically make you feel better,\nmore alert, and more\ncapable for everything.\nI don't think that's a\nhyperbolic statement, I, in fact,\nI know it's not a hyperbolic\nstatement because we have a\nsystem in our body that connects our brain\nto all of our bodily organs\nand connects all of those\nbodily organs to our brain.\nAnd that communication\nbetween brain and body\nin both directions creates a situation\nwhere either we are\npositioned to do things well,\nor we are positioned to do things poorly.\nSo I really want to dive in and dissect,\nwhat is this system of\nbrain, body communication?\nWhat does it look like?\nWhat are the actual\nneurons and connections?\nAnd as I do that,\nI promise that I'm going\nto place protocols,\ntools that you can apply\nin order to make sure\nthat those neurons and\nconnections are working optimally.\nSo let's begin by talking about\nwhat system communicates the\nbrain to the body and the\nbody back to the brain.\nThe system that's most often\nassociated with this is our\n10th cranial nerve called the vagus nerve.\nThe word vagus relates\nto the word vagabond,\nwhich to wander, and indeed\nthe vagus nerve is a vast,\nenormous wandering set of\nnerves, so it's not one nerve.\nIt's not like one fiber, one axon.\nAs we say in the nervous\nsystem, we have these wires,\nwe call axons that let\nneurons communicate.\nIt's a bunch of neurons and a bunch\nof wires that go everywhere,\nso where do they go?\nWell they leave the\nbrain, and the brain stem,\nthe brain stem is kind of\nthe back of your brain.\nIf you touch the back of your neck,\nit's about three inches deep\nto where you're touching.\nThe neurons that are there\nsend information into the body\nto control your bodily organs,\nhow fast your heart is,\nbeating how fast you're breathing,\nhow fast your digestion is occurring.\nEven things like whether\nor not you are going\nto secrete so-called killer cells,\nyour immune cells from your\nspleen to go ward off bacteria.\nNow the neurons there don't\nknow what to do unless they\nreceive information about\nwhat's going on within the body\nand within the body, your heart,\nyour lungs, your diaphragm,\nyour gut, so everything\nfrom your intestines\nto your stomach, et cetera,\nand your spleen or sending\ninformation also up to the brain.\nSo as I mentioned before,\nit's a two-way street.\nSo the vagus nerve is\na very important nerve,\nbut just by saying vagus nerve,\nit sounds like a singular.\nIt sounds like one thing,\nbut actually what we're\ntalking about is a series\nof super highways, it's like Google maps,\nit's got stuff going everywhere\nwith alternate routes,\ncommunicating back and forth.\nThere are two fundamental\nfeatures of what's going\non in your body that\nneed to be communicated\nto your brain, these neurons\nin your brain stem in order\nfor your brain and your body\nto work together correctly.\nAnd the two types of information\nare mechanical information.\nSo things like pressure,\nthings like lack of pressure\nand chemical information,\nwhether or not your gut is acidic\nor whether or not it's not acidic,\nwhether or not you have some\nsort of pathogen, you know,\nsomething that you ate or that\ngot into your body somehow\nand is making you sick or whether or not\nyou don't have a pathogen in your body.\nSo you've got mechanical\nsensing and chemical sensing.\nSo when you think about your sense\nof self and your ability\nto understand what's going\non in your body, if you feel\ngood, or if you feel bad,\nyour sense of self is\ndependent on these mechanical\nphenomenon and these chemical phenomenon.\nAnd for every organ in your body,\nwhether or not that's\nyour heart or your lungs\nor your spleen, both the\nmechanical information about\nthat organ for instance, is\nif your gut is full or empty,\nwhether or not your heart is\nbeating fast or beating slowly,\nthat's mechanical, and\nchemical information,\nwhether or not your gut feels\nnice, and whether, you know,\nwhen I say nice, I mean,\nwhether or not it has a balance\nof acidity and alkalinity,\nthat feels right to you or\nwhether or not your gut feels\noff, it doesn't feel quite right.\nThat's chemical information.\nIf you are not getting enough oxygen\nand levels of carbon dioxide\nand other gas go up too high.\nSo your lungs can register\nthat and that chemical\ninformation is sent to your brain.\nAnd then your brain does\ncertain things actually really\nencourages you to do certain things\nin order to adjust that chemistry.\nSo the first principle that\neveryone should understand about\ntheir sense of self is that\nthey are sensing mechanical\nand chemical information about every organ\nin their body, except for\none, and that's the brain.\nYour brain actually doesn't\nhave pain receptors.\nIt doesn't even have touch receptors.\nThe brain is a command center.\nIt helps drive and govern changes\nin the organs of the body.\nBut your brain doesn't\nmove, at least not much.\nIt can move a little bit\nfluid moves within it.\nBut as long as you're healthy,\nit's not moving that much.\nYour brain has no sensation\nof its own, in fact, when they\ndo brain surgery on people,\nthey will the size or put\nsome anesthesia on the scalp.\nThey'll cut away the skin there\nso that people don't feel anything.\nThey'll use some anesthesia\nthey'll peel back the skin\nand then they'll use a,\nlet's call it what it is, it's a bone saw.\nAnd they basically saw open\na little window in the skull.\nI've actually done this\nbefore and seen this before.\nI've done this many times before,\nand once you're inside the brain,\nyou can put electrodes in\nthere and you can put various\nthings in there, of course,\nall for therapeutic purposes.\nAnd you do that without any\nanesthesia to the actual brain\ntissue, because it has no\nreceptors to sense anything.\nIt doesn't have pain receptors.\nIt doesn't have pressure receptors.\nNone of that, when you have a headache\nin your head, feels like\nit's too much pressure,\nwell that's because of here's\nthat lie outside the brain.\nSo your organs are different.\nThey need to tell your\nbrain what's going on.\nAnd there are ways that you\ncan control the mechanical\nand the chemical state of your organs\nin ways that are very\npowerful, and this is crucial\nto do, because if you can\nproperly regulate the mechanical\nand chemical environment\nof your body, your brain functions better.\nThis is absolutely clear from data\nthat if your gut is healthy,\nif you get the alkalinity\nright, the acidity, right,\nand if your spleen is healthy\nand happy, and if your\nlungs are working properly,\nnot just breathing and\npumping in and out air,\nbut you're breathing at the\nright cadence for a particular\nactivity, then your brain\nwill function better.\nSo let's talk about how you\ncan adjust the mechanical\nand chemical environment of your organs\nin order to make your brain better\nand how your brain can make the mechanical\nand chemical environment within\nyour organs function better.\nFor instance we're going to talk about\nhow you can change the\nchemistry of your gut in order\nfor your brain to be able to\nfocus better, think better,\nremember better and sleep better.\nAnd we're going to talk\nabout how you can change\nthe chemistry of other\norgans in your body,\nsuch that your immune\nsystem will function better\nthan it would otherwise.\nAnd you can actually heal\nfaster from small cuts and\nbruises, but also injuries of\nany kind, even major injuries.\nSo as I mentioned before,\nwe've got these organs,\nthe heart, the lungs, the diaphragm,\nand I'll explain what that\nis, the gut and the spleen.\nAnd the spleen is this immune organ.\nLet's take one example of these\nand explain how mechanical\nand chemical information\nfrom this particular set\nof organs communicates to the brain\nand how that changes how our brain works.\nAnd the organ I'd like to focus on first\nare the lungs and the diaphragm.\nSo we're all familiar with\nour lungs, these two big bags\nof air, but they're actually\nnot two big bags of air.\nThey actually have little\ntiny sacs within them,\nactually millions of little sacs\ncalled the alveoli of the lungs.\nThe alveoli of the lungs\nare like little tiny balloons\nthroughout our lungs,\nand the more of those balloons, we have,\nthe more air that we can actually contain.\nSo we are not too big bags\nof air in there, our lungs,\nwe actually have millions and\nmillions of little tiny bags\nof air within those lungs.\nThose little bags of air can\nfill up or they can deflate,\nright, just like your\nlungs overall can fill up\nor they can deflate.\nThe diaphragm is a muscle, it's\nkind of shaped like a dome.\nSo it's kind of a, you know,\nthink about a basketball or a soccer ball\nthat has most of the air pushed out of it.\nAnd so it's kind of crescent\nshape or dome shaped,\nand it sits below our lungs\nand the way the diaphragm\nand the lungs work together\nis very interesting.\nThe diaphragm is actually\nskeletal muscles.\nSo it's just like a bicep or a quadricep.\nAnd the fact that it is\nskeletal muscle is important\nbecause it has a unique property,\nwhich is that you can\ncontrol it voluntarily.\nYou can decide to take control\nof your diaphragm by just\nconsciously deciding you want\nto breathe in a particular way,\njust like you can take conscious\ncontrol over your legs.\nThey will work just fine,\nif you're not thinking\nabout them, as you walk as\nprovide, you already know\nhow to walk, but at any moment,\nyou can decide to change the rate\nof your walking, your\nso-called cadence of walking.\nSo the diaphragm as a\nskeletal muscle also has\nthat property, the diaphragm moves up\nand down, depending on how you breathe,\nor rather, I should say\nhow the diaphragm moves up\nand down determines how you breathe.\nHow you breathe is also dependent\non little muscles that are\nbetween your ribs, the\nintercostals and other muscles,\nif you're a martial arts fan\nthat Bruce Lee was famous\nfor having these very pronounced\nintercostals from doing all\nsorts of, you know, bridging\nexercise, et cetera.\nBut those are the muscles.\nAnd we all have them, even if some\nof us, most of us don't have,\nintercostals like Bruce Lee.\nSo when you breathe a\ncouple things happen,\nbut let's talk about the\nmechanical things first.\nAnd then let's talk about how\nthose mechanical steps relate\nback to the brain and what\nthat does for the brain.\nAnd I can promise you that\nif you develop an awareness\nof these mechanical changes,\nyou do not have to go through\nextensive breathwork practice\nor do extensive breathwork.\nYou will immediately believe\nit or not develop a sense\nof your breathing self of\nyour lungs and diaphragm.\nIt takes no practice, but once you do it,\nyou will forever be changed\nin terms of your awareness of\nyour breathing and your ability\nto leverage your breathing.\nKind of like the steering\nwheel on a car in order\nto shift your brain in the\ndirection that you want to go.\nSo it's a very powerful system.\nAnd the way it works is the following.\nAnd this will also\nincorporate the heart, so,\nand by the heart, I don't mean\nit in the emotional sense.\nAlthough we don't rule out emotions here\nat the Huberman Lab\npodcast, we like emotions,\nbut I'm talking about the heart\nas an organ, as a beating\norgan, that circulates blood.\nSo when we inhale, these little\nsacs in our lungs fill up\nand our lungs expand.\nAnd when we do that, we take\nup space in our thoracic cavity\nand our diaphragm moves down, okay.\nWhen we exhale, the diaphragm moves up,\nthe lungs get smaller, okay?\nSo inhales, diaphragm moves down.\nExhales, diaphragm moves up.\nThis actually controls our heart rate,\nbut it does it by changing\nthe way that our brain works.\nAnd it works in the following way.\nSo when we inhale, our lungs\nfill our diaphragm moves down.\nOur heart actually has a little more space\nbecause the diaphragm's moved down.\nSo the heart gets a little\nbit bigger, physically bigger,\nnot in the emotional sense,\nbut physically bigger.\nAnd as a consequence,\nwhatever blood is in the\nheart flows at a slower rate\nbecause it's a larger volume,\nso bigger volume heart,\nsame amount of blood inside\nthe heart means slower flow.\nOkay, sort of like expanding a pipe.\nThe brain registers that\nbecause there are a set\nof neurons in the heart\ncalled the sinoatrial node.\nIt sends that information to the brain.\nThat information is registered\nby the brain and the brain\nsends a message back to the\nheart to speed the heart up.\nSo every time you inhale because\nof these mechanical changes\nin the diaphragm and lungs,\nand because of the mechanical\nchanges in the heart,\nyour brain sends a signal to\nthe heart to speed the heart\nup, so if you do long inhales\nor you inhale more vigorously,\nyou actually are speeding your heart up.\nNow, of course you have to exhale as well.\nBut for instance, if I were\nto inhale very long like\n[inhales heavily]\nthe entire time my heart\nrate is increasing.\nAnd then if I did a quick exhale,\n[exhales quickly]\nsomething else will happen,\nbut if I kept doing that,\n[inhales heavily, exhales quickly]\nmy heart rate would increase.\nIt's not going to increase\nlinearly and forever,\nbut it will increase with each inhale.\nOr I can simply make my\ninhales more vigorous.\n[inhales quickly]\nAnd my heart rate will speed up.\nThis is an autonomic and\nautomatic relationship\nbetween the diaphragm, the\nlungs, the brain, and the heart.\nNow, if inhale speed the heart\nup, what happens on exhales?\nWhen we exhale, the diaphragm moves up.\nIt's a little counterintuitive,\nbut you can kind of think about it\nas like pushing the plunge\non a syringe, right?\nWhen you exhale,\nthis thing moves up and\nas the diaphragm moves up,\nthe heart has less space.\nMeaning it gets a little bit smaller,\nwhich means that whatever\nvolume of blood is inside the\nheart moves faster, through\nthat smaller volume,\nthat information is sent to\nthe brain via these collection\nof neurons called the sinoatrial\nnode for you aficionados.\nThe brain then sends information\nvia the vagus nerve back\nto the heart, to slow the heart down.\nSo while inhales speed up the heart,\nthat's the net effect\nexhales, slow the heart down.\nAnd the reason they slow the heart down is\nbecause of a register in the\nchange in mechanical pressure\nbetween the diaphragm,\nthe lungs and the heart.\nSo this is to me, the simplest\nand most straightforward example\nof how the brain is changing\nthe way our organs work,\nour heart in this case,\naccording to changes in\nmechanical interoception.\nNow, we're not always aware\nof this, some of us are aware\nof it, some of us aren't.\nIf you do it right now,\nyou will be aware of\nit, so you can try this.\nYou can basically, this is an experiment\nor an example in interoception,\nin sensing one's self.\nSo if you inhale, doesn't\nmatter how long you inhale.\nI'll do it for a couple seconds\n[inhales quickly]\nand then exhale twice as long.\n[exhales slowly]\nNose or mouth, doesn't\nmatter, the entire time\nthat you're exhaling, you're\nslowing your heart down.\nSo just as a car has an\naccelerator and a brake,\nor you can slow a car by\ncoming off the accelerator.\nWhen you exhale,\nyou're effectively coming\noff the accelerator,\nor if you want to think\nabout it differently,\nyou're hitting the brake,\nyou're slowing down your heart rate.\nNow, normally your heart\nrate stays in more or less\nthe same range for a given activity\nbecause you're inhaling and exhaling.\nBut this is just a simple way of showing\nthat mechanical changes in\nyour viscera can change the way\nthat your brain works\nand then your brain changes the\nway that those viscera work.\nAnd it's a very concrete agreement,\nit's like a contract between the organs\nof your body and the brain.\nIn fact, you can think about\nthis contract in more detail,\nand you can leverage this\nin a very powerful way\nto set the conditions of your mind.\nIf you want to be more\ncalm, emphasize exhales,\nand the simplest way to do this.\nI've talked about this many times before,\nbut if you haven't heard me say it,\nthis will become immediately clear is\nto emphasize exhales through\nwhat's called a physiological sigh.\nTwo inhales, could be through\nthe nose of the mouth,\nbut ideally through the nose,\nso [inhales quickly twice]\nso followed by a long\nexhale. [exhales slowly]\nThose double inhales are\nkind of important because\nwhat they do is they maximally\nfill all those little sacs\nin your lungs, and then\nwhen you breathe out,\nyou're exhaling as much of\nthe so-called carbon dioxide\nin your system as possible.\nWe'll talk about carbon oxide in a second.\nSo the fastest way to calm\ndown is to emphasize exhales.\nWhen you make exhales longer,\nyou're slowing your heart\nrate, you're calming down.\nYou don't need any sophisticated training.\nYou don't have to do\nthis for minutes on end.\nYou don't have to do anything.\nYou don't even have to call it breathwork.\nIt's just respiration, and in\nfact, you do this every night.\nWhen you go to sleep and carbon\ndioxide builds up too much\nin your bloodstream,\nor if you hold your breath or something,\nor you watch an animal or a\nsmall child that sleeping,\nthey will occasionally do these\ndouble inhale long exhales\nit's way of slowing the heart down\nand eliminating carbon oxide.\nThe opposite is also true.\nIf you inhale deeply or vigorously\nand then exhale less\nlong or less vigorously,\nyou will increase your level\nof alertness through these\npurely mechanical aspects\nof your interoception.\nSo for instance, if I were\nto take a big deep inhale\n[inhales deeply] and then a short exhale,\n[exhales quickly] and then\nanother one, a big inhale,\n[inhales deeply] short\nexhale, [exhales quickly]\nIt only takes two or three of those\nbefore you start to feel more alert.\nAnd that's because your\nheart rate is increasing.\nAnd actually if you keep doing that\nfor 25 or 30 breaths of\ninhale deep short exhale,\nyou will start to secrete\na lot of adrenaline.\nThis hormone that comes from your kidneys\nand from your brainstem\nmake you feel really alert.\nYou will actually feel as if\nyou've had a cup of espresso.\nSo you will immediately wake up.\nAnd there's an intermediate form\nof breathing, which is\nsometimes called box breathing,\nbut it's really equal\ninhale and exhale duration.\nAnd these, it basically goes like this.\nYou're you're going to inhale,\nso do this for maybe two,\nthree seconds inhale, [inhales]\nthen hold, okay, two, three seconds.\nThen exhale, two, three seconds.\nThen hold two, three seconds.\nMost often people forget to hold.\nSo it's inhale, hold, exhale, hold\nfor equal or more or less equal durations,\ncould be one second, could be two seconds,\ncould be three seconds.\nMost people find that when you get\nout past five seconds,\nthey start to struggle\nto maintain the so-called box breathing.\nAnd most people can't\nconsciously box breathe\nfor too terribly long without\nhaving to think about it.\nBut the point here is that\nthrough purely mechanical means\nchanging the way that you\nbreathe, emphasizing inhales\nor exhales, or keeping them the same\nwill change the way that your brain works,\nhow alert you are and how\nwell you function in anything.\nAnd again, this doesn't mean\nthat breathwork has no value.\nIt's just simply to say\nthat long extended protocols\nof breathwork are simply,\nthey are truly simply just\nan exploration of this\nfundamental relationship\nbetween the mechanics\nof your internal organs and your brain\nand how your brain controls\nthose internal organs.\nNow you might ask, well,\nhow is this pressure known?\nHow does the body actually know\nhow full the lungs are, now?\nThis is an answer that's more\nfor the aficionados out there,\nbut I've had a few requests,\nor I should say thousands of\nrequests for more in-depth\nscience, so if you're not\ninterested more in depth science,\njust this will allow you to\ntune out now for maybe just 10\nseconds, and if you are\ninterested, pay careful attention,\nthere is a set of receptors\nwhich are called piezo receptors,\nP-I-E-Z-O piezo receptors,\npiezo means pressure.\nAnd these were discovered\na few years ago by a couple\nof different laboratories,\nbut one of the main ones,\none of the main laboratories\nthat discovered these piezo receptors\nis the laboratory of Ardem Patapoutian.\nI love saying his name,\neven though I'm probably pronouncing it,\nhe's a friend and a former\ncolleague when my lab was down\nin San Diego, he's at\nthe Scripps Institute,\nhe's a Howard Hughes Medical\nInstitute investigator,\nwhich basically means\nthat he's a total stud\nof science and has made\nmany important discoveries.\nThe piezo receptors line many tissues,\nand inform the brain about\npressure in those tissues.\nBut the lungs have a particular category\nof piezo receptors called\npiezo two receptors.\nAnd as you fill your lungs\nand these little sacs\nof air, the alveoli fill,\nthe piezo two receptors\nbecause of the way they\nreact to that filling\nsend information by way\nof a bunch of neurons,\na bunch of wires up to the\nbrain and tell you how full your\nlungs are, so that's the\nkind of mechanistic detail.\nIf you want to learn more about that,\nyou can look up our\nArdem's lab at the Scripps\nand the beautiful work that\nthey and other laboratories\nare doing on piezos,\npiezos are pretty cool.\nI think I also just like saying piezo,\nso that's why I brought that up as well.\nSo mechanical sensing of the\nlungs, heart and diaphragm.\nAnd now let's talk about chemical sensing\nbecause there's carbon\ndioxide and there's oxygen.\nAnd this is really simple.\nYou have oxygen and carbon\ndioxide and you need them both.\nI sometimes hear people\ntalk about carbon dioxide\nis this bad thing and\noxygen, it has a good thing.\nYou need them both,\nand you need them in\nthe appropriate balance.\nYou have a collection of neurons\nin your brain that register\nwhen carbon dioxide levels\nget to a certain point\nin your bloodstream.\nWhen that point, that\nthreshold is reached,\nthese neurons fire,\nand they cause you to\nbreathe sometimes called\nthe gasp reflex, it just\nmakes you want to inhale.\nAnd as a consequence,\nyou bring in more oxygen.\nOkay, so we don't really\nbreathe to get oxygen.\nThat's a by-product of inhaling\nto eliminate carbon dioxide.\nYou don't want carbon dioxide\nlevels to go too high.\nIn fact, if you want to freak\nsomebody out and we do these\nin experiments, and I don't\nrecommend you do this,\nyou just increase the levels\nof carbon dioxide that they\ninhale, and the brain will go\ninto an almost immediate panic\nresponse because the health\nof all our tissues depends on\nkeeping a nice balance between\ncarbon dioxide and oxygen.\nYou don't want carbon dioxide\nlevels to go too high.\nSo the impulse to breathe,\nif you're under water,\nor if you hold your breath is triggered\nby these neurons and the\ntriggering of those neurons comes\nfrom elevated carbon\ndioxide in the bloodstream.\nAnd for those of you that don't quite know\nhow to conceptualize the relationship\nbetween bloodstream and breath,\nI do think it's important.\nAnd maybe you remember this\nfrom high school biology,\nbut if you don't,\nI'll make it clear for\nyou now, it's very easy.\nYou inhale air and that air\nand the oxygen molecules\nin that air actually move\nfrom your lungs into the bloodstream\nbecause these little alveoli of the lungs,\nthose little sacs of air are in there,\nthey basically have a lot\nof little micro vessels\nand capillaries, little tiny,\nbasically blood vessels,\nessentially, although\nthey're mostly capillaries,\nmicro capillaries are\nthe little tiny ones,\nthat line them, so there's actually\nan interface and opportunity for air\nand molecules within the\nair to pass into the blood\nand then they move in your\nbloodstream, and when you exhale,\nthe opposite is true.\nSo you can move things from the air,\ninto your bloodstream or from\nyour bloodstream into the air\nby way of the lungs, and\nthere's a lot more detail to it.\nAnd I'm sure those of you\nthat are experts out there.\nIf you want to put some\nstuff in the comments,\nmaybe a little bit of a kind\nof intermediate tutorial,\nyou might even entitle\nit, intermediate tutorial.\nIf you know a lot about\nthis, just I'll check it,\nbut make sure you get the details, right.\nMake sure you know the process.\nAnd I find that for\npeople that are interested\nin understanding how\nbreathing really works,\nit's really nice to think\nabout the relationship\nbetween the heart and the vascular system,\nthe blood and the air system,\nthe respiration system,\nand breathing, because those\ntwo things are very, we say,\nthey're interdigitated, they're\ninterwoven with one another.\nSo how does this work, well,\ncarbon dioxide is too high,\nyou breathe in, you inspire, you,\ninhale you off as a consequence,\nwhen you exhale, you\noffload carbon dioxide.\nThere's a really cool way\nthat you can explore this\nchemistry of your breathing\nand your bloodstream\nand the way that your brain works\nin ways that can really\nbenefit your health.\nAnd it works the following way.\nYou want to essentially sit or lie down.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nYou definitely don't want\nto be anywhere near water,\nnot a bathtub, not a hot\ntub, not a, you know,\nnot a cold dunk or something.\nIn fact, don't even be in a puddle.\nAnd what you want to do\nin this case is you're\ngoing to breathe in deep.\nSo that's going to increase\nyour heart rate and then exhale\npassively by just letting\nair fall out of your mouth.\nSo it will look something like this.\n[inhales vigorously, exhales passively]\nSo it's you breathe in vigorously\nand then you let the air\njust fall out of your mouth.\nWhen you do that,\nwhat you're essentially\ndoing is you're bringing\nin a lot of oxygen\nthrough that deep breath.\nAnd you're exhaling a little\nbit of that carbon dioxide.\nBut if you were to repeat\nit 25 times, maybe 30 times,\nit doesn't matter if it's 25\nor 30, somewhere in there,\nyou would essentially start\nbringing in a lot of oxygen\nand blowing off or exhaling\na lot of carbon dioxide.\nSo you're actually going\nto change the chemistry\nof your internal landscape,\nand you can then sense it.\nYou can interocept what that is like.\nAnd there are some really\ninteresting reasons\nfor wanting to do that, so\nI'm not going to do all 25\nor 30 now, maybe do five or 10,\nso you can get a sense\nof what it looks like,\nso that it's clear.\nI'm going to essentially\ndemonstrate now, so it's inhale,\n[inhales vigorously]\nexhale through the mouth,[exhales]\nI am inhaling the nose,\n[inhales vigorously, exhales\npassively multiple times]\nSo it's essentially, excuse\nme, a two second or so inhale\nand then a one second or so\nexhale, and as I was doing that,\nI can kind of feel my face get\nflush and my body is heating\nup and my brain is heating\nup, what's happening there?\nWell that pattern of breathing\nis increasing levels of adrenaline\nin my brain and body, and\nI'm getting more alert.\nThen after 25 or 30 of those,\nyou exhale all your air.\n[exhales deeply]\nYou dump all your air.\nYou can do that, your nose or your mouth.\nAnd then you hold your\nbreath with your lungs empty\nfor about 15 to 30 seconds.\nNow, for those of you that want\nto explore this, and please be\ncareful as you explore this,\ndon't do anything stupid,\nlike do this while you're\ndriving or something like that.\nYou can exhale all your air\nand what you'll find then\nis you can hold your breath\nfor a very long time.\nAnd the reason you can do that\nis because you've blown off\nall the carbon dioxide or\nmost of the carbon dioxide\nin your bloodstream.\nSo you shifted the chemistry of your blood\nby breathing in a particular way.\nAnd by doing that,\nyou are no longer triggering these neurons\nthat cause the gasp reflex\nor the reflex to breathe.\nNow, of course you have\nto breathe sooner or later\nbut what you'll find is if\nnormally your ability to hold\nyour breath is a minute or\nso before you really feel\nthat gasp reflex kick in,\nyou might find that you can\ngo 90 seconds or two minutes.\nAnd with some practice,\npeople find that they can\nstart holding their breath\nfor three or four minutes or longer.\nThis is actually how free\ndivers do what they do.\nI do not want anyone free diving.\nIf you're going to learn free diving,\nplease learn it from an expert.\nMany people die trying to teach\nthemselves out of free dive\nor trying to teach their\nfriends at a free dive\nwhen they don't know what they're doing.\nThis is not what this\nis about, don't again,\ndon't do this anywhere near water,\nbut it is a very interesting\nexploration of how you can\nshift the chemistry of your\nbloodstream by modulating your\nair by modulating the mechanics\nof your diaphragm and lungs\nand thereby shift the way\nyour mind works, your brain.\nAnd in fact, what you'll\nnotice is that even though\nduring that 25 or 30 breaths,\n[inhales and exhales quickly]\nyou'll feel very alert,\nwhen you exhale all your air\nand you're in the breath hold,\nyou will feel very alert,\nbut very calm.\nNow this is interesting\nbecause it's a state that we all sort\nof want to achieve alert, but calm,\nbut have a hard time achieving.\nAnd so for those of you that\nhave a hard time obtaining\nfocus for sake of work or\nfocus for sake of anything I\nshould say, and when you\nare able to achieve focus,\nit's through the use of\nthings like stimulants,\nor you feel like you have\nto have a cold shower\nor ice bath, or you have to\nhave four espresso in order\nto be alert, but then you're\ntoo alert, you're jittery.\nYou can't focus.\nThis pattern of breathing\ncan lend itself very well\nto entering states of alert,\nbut calm for the fall,\nthe 10 or even 20 minutes\nthat follow that breathing.\nAnd then you could repeat it if you want.\nSo it's a very useful practice to explore.\nSome of you may be familiar\nwith this practice and\nso-called Wim Hof breathing.\nWim Hof is a practitioner of\nwhat's called Tumo breathing.\nTumo breathing has been\naround for centuries.\nAnd for those of you that are familiar\nwith breathwork and yoga practices,\nI acknowledged that nothing\nI just described is new based\non science, however,\nthe science informs why\nthose practices work.\nAnd just as a little mini editorial,\nI just want to emphasize as well.\nThat one thing that this podcast\nis really about is trying\nto remove fancy nomenclature, whether\nor not it's yogic nomenclature\nor scientific nomenclature\nso that people can access protocols.\nBecause the moment we start\nnaming things after people\nor calling them Tumo et cetera,\nI have no problem with that,\nbut it doesn't inform how\nthe practices are done,\nnor does it inform the\nunderlying mechanisms.\nSo here I'm trying to\nteach you the mechanisms.\nAnd as a final point to that,\nthe most powerful form\nof breathing is the one\nthat takes into account\nthe fundamental mechanisms\nthat in increase heart rate,\nthat exhales decrease heart\nrate, and that carbon dioxide\nand oxygen relate to the\nbloodstream and the brain\nin particular ways, once you\nunderstand those components,\nthen you can create your own\nso-called breathwork practices.\nYou can breathe in the\nways that best serve you,\nas opposed to thinking that\none protocol is the best\nor holy protocol for everything,\nbecause it's simply not.\nAs a final final point,\nI want to say that as you\nshift the way that you breathe,\nwhether or not you're showing\noff more carbon dioxide\nor bringing in more oxygen,\nyou are fundamentally\nchanging the chemistry\nof your internal milieu have your body,\nand that has been shown\nto have important effects\non the way that your immune\nsystem functions and the way\nthat you deal with\ninflammation and all sorts\nof different sort of things\nthat can enter your body\nand cause problems or\nconditions of stress, et cetera.\nSo I will explore that further\nas the episode goes on,\nbut I want to move on to just\ntouch on one other aspect\nof reading, that's purely mechanical,\nwhich I think is very interesting\nand important, which relates\nto a particular reflex\nthat you're going to be very\nfamiliar with in a second.\nAnd that can serve you very\nwell in times of extreme stress.\nThe reflex I'm referring to\nis something called the\nHering Breuer Reflex.\nI'm not going to go into details\nabout how the Hering Breuer reflex works,\nbut it has to do with particular classes\nof neurons and cells that\nare called a Baroreceptors.\nThose are basically pressure\nreceptors, they sense pressure.\nAnd basically what the\nHering Breuer reflex is\nabout is that when your lung is inflated,\nyour desire to breathe is reduced.\nSo you can try that\nright now, you can inhale\n[inhales] huge big thing of air.\nAnd hold, okay?\nYour desire to breathe\nwill kick in later than\nwere are you to exhale all\nyour air and hold your breath.\nWhen you exhale all your\nair and your breath,\nunless you've done the sort\nof protocol I described a few\nminutes ago of doing a bunch\nof inhales and exhales first\nin a very deliberate\nway, you will feel empty.\nThose Baroreceptors are\ngoing to be firing like crazy\nsaying, there's no pressure in here,\nthere's no pressure here,\nI got nothing in here.\nYou need to breathe,\nyou need to breathe in,\nthe gasp reflex will kick in sooner.\nYou can apply that in all\nsorts of situations related\nto exercise, related to\nmodulating stress, et cetera.\nSo the Hering Breuer reflex\nis a very powerful one.\nThis is why you take a big deep breath\nbefore you go under\nwater. [inhales heavily]\nAll right, you're not going\nto exhale all your air and go under water.\nIf you were to exhale all\nyour air and go under water,\nyou would absolutely feel\nthe need to come up sooner\nfor a breath of air than\nhad you a full tank,\nso to speak a full of lungs full of air.\nAnd this is also the way\nthat people teach themselves\nto feel comfortable under water.\nSo when you learn how to swim,\nyou learn how to swim both by having air\nin your lungs while you're\nunderwater and no air\nin your lungs while you're underwater.\nIn any event the Hering\nBreuer reflex is yet another\ndimension to the way that\nmechanical pressure influences\nyour brain's decision-making,\nabout what to do\nwith your body, in this case,\nwhether or not to breathe.\nSo now I want to shift away from breathing\nand diaphragm and lungs and\nmove toward another organ\nwithin our viscera, which is our gut.\nSo this includes our stomach\nand our intestines, our\nesophagus and so forth.\nIt's been said before,\nboth by me and by others\nthat we are, but a series of\ntubes, and indeed that's true.\nBelieve it or not, every\nsystem in your body is a tube.\nYour brain is actually a tube\nthat connects your spinal\ncord, which has also a tube.\nYou started off as a tube,\nyou were like a churro.\nYou know, those churros\nI don't know if you're\nnot familiar with churros,\nthey're like donuts that\nare shaped like a tube.\nThat's essentially what you\nlook like early in development,\nnot long after conception\nand the front end\nof that churro grew and grew and grew,\nbut you always maintained\na hollow through that tube.\nThat's why you have what are\ncalled ventricles, gaps or a\nspace in your brain and spinal\ncord that run the length\nof your brain and spinal cord\nand fluid, cerebral spinal fluid,\nand other things move through that space.\nWe're going to return\nto the ventricles later,\nthey are very important.\nThey're just space filled\nwith fluid, but they do a lot.\nSimilarly your digestive system\nstarts with the tube at your mouth\nand of course goes down\nthrough your throat.\nAnd then you've got all\nthe elements of the stomach\nand the intestines, and then\nit comes out the other end.\nSo you are, but a series\nof different tubes,\nyour vascular system, a\nseries of other tubes.\nSo you're tubes.\nThe way your digestive system works\nis to communicate to your brain\nabout the status of the\nmechanical pressures\nalong this tube, so within your stomach\nand your intestines, et cetera,\nand the chemical status of\nthat tube at various portions\nwithin that tube to inform your brain\nabout how your brain\nshould control that tube.\nSo let's start with the\nmechanical sensing of your gut.\nIf you drink a lot of fluid,\nor if you eat a lot of food,\nyour gut will fill up, your\nstomach will fill up with food.\nNow it gets digested there.\nIt gets digested elsewhere\nalong your digestive track too,\nof course but it starts\ngetting digested there\nbecause along this tube,\nyou have a series of what\nare called sphincters,\nwhich basically are\nlike little draw pulls.\nHave you ever had a laundry bag,\nwhich has a drawstring on it?\nYou pull it and then it cinches shut,\nand then you can open it\nagain, that's what those are.\nThose are sphincter\nopenings and you have them\nin your throat, you have them\nalong your digestive tract,\nall the way to the end.\nFood will enter your gut.\nAnd if there's a lot of that\nfood, pressure receptors,\nsome of which are these\npiezo receptors will\ncommunicate to the areas of\nyour brain that are involved\nin feeding, and we'll\nsay, don't eat anymore.\nYou don't need to consume anymore, now,\nsome people bypass that these,\nI guess they have these like\nhotdog eating competitions.\nI'm always struck by how some\nof those people are like,\nseem to be rail thin,\nbut they actually train for\nthose competitions by ingesting\nlarge volumes of water, actually\na very dangerous practice.\nYou can actually kill yourself\nby drinking too much water,\nand you can kill yourself by\ningesting too much of anything,\nreally to expand your\ngut, not a good practice,\nnot a big fan of those competitions.\nBut even if you're one of those\npeople or you're the world\nheavyweight champion of them,\nthey are informative\ntoward what I'm talking\nabout now, which is that\nas you expand the gut,\na signal is sent by neurons,\nliterally nerve cells that\nare in the gut to the brain,\nstem up to the areas of\nthe brain that are involved\nin feeding, I did a\nwhole episode on feeding.\nYou can find on \"Feeding,\nMetabolism And Hunger.\"\nYou're welcome to listen to\nthat episode, if you like,\nand we'll shut down the\nneurons that drive the desire\nto put more stuff in your mouth.\nThat thing that people say sometimes\non well in this country frequently\nafter Thanksgiving meal,\nI can't put another bite in my mouth.\nLiterally they shut down\nsome of the basic movements\nof the musculature to\ntake another fork bite.\nI know it sounds crazy,\nbut they can actually control your brain.\nSo your gut is so full that\nit's controlling your brains,\nsuch that this action of spooning food\ntowards your mouth is actually inhibited.\nIt's made more difficult\nor less likely to occur.\nIt's incredible.\nThe converse is also true, when\nthese piezo receptors signal\nto the brain, that the\ngut is empty independent\nof your need, your actual need for food.\nThere's a signal that sent to\nyour brain that says gut is\nempty and neurons get stimulated\nin areas like the arcuate\nnucleus and these areas\nof the hypothalamus\nand et cetera, that drive the\ndesire to make this action,\nto open the mouth and to put\nstuff in it in particular food.\nSo when you find yourself\nat the refrigerator\nor you find yourself almost, you know,\nmanically trying to get\nfood of different cons,\nyou're not even thinking\nabout what you're eating,\nbecause you're so hungry, in\npart that's because the lack\nof food in your gut has sent\nthat information to your brain\nand is driving particular\nfixed action patterns\nthat are associated with eating, in fact,\none of the first things\nchildren learn how to do is open\ntheir mouth when something\nis presented to it.\nAnd then they learn how\nto move a spoon or a fork.\nThey're not very good at\nit, at first, they get all\nover the place, but\neventually they get good at,\nor at least most people get good at\nif you watch how people eat, you know,\nit's kind of very variable out there.\nIn any event, this is a\npurely mechanical phenomenon.\nAnd this purely mechanical\nphenomenon is driving our brain\nto drive certain behavior.\nYou can get better at registering sense\nof fullness or lack of fullness\nin a very particular way.\nSome people have a very\nkeen sense of how full\nor empty their stomach is,\nso if you've eaten anything,\neven if it's a small volume\nof food in the last hour\nto three hours,\nit's actually a worthwhile\npractice to take a few moments,\nmaybe 10, 20 seconds,\nand actually just try and\nconcentrate on sensing the neurons\nin your gut and how full\nyou are, like for instance,\nI ate a few hours ago and\nthen I had a little snack\nabout 30 minutes ago or so.\nAnd my gut feels neither\nterribly full nor terribly empty.\nIt's kind of, I would put it\nkind of like 30, 40% okay.\nSo by just taking conscious awareness\nof how full or empty our gut is\nat various times between\nmeals, after a meal,\nbefore a meal, you can very\nquickly develop a sense\nof how full or empty you are.\nNow, what's the consequence of that?\nThe consequence of that is\nactually rather interesting.\nIt's been shown that the consequence of\nthat is actually that you can\nbetter override the signals\nof these piezo receptors and\ngut fullness or emptiness.\nSo for those of you that\nfind that you eat kind\nof compulsively or non-consciously,\nor subconsciously, I should say,\nprobably have to be conscious\nenough to be awake to eat,\nbut subconsciously you\njust find yourself eating\nand here I'm describing myself, I'm like,\nI'm a drive by blueberry eater.\nIf there's a bowl of blueberries,\nevery time I walk past it,\nI sort of have to grab a handful of them\nand pop them in my mouth,\nbut if you develop this sense\nof how much mecho-pressure,\nit's not really word,\nbut how much mechano-sensation\nis in your gut, very quickly,\nyou can learn to override that.\nYou might ask, why would I\nwant to be able to override\nwhether or not my stomach is\nempty or my stomach is full?\nWell, there are many\nreasons to want to do that.\nMany people right now are interested\nin so-called intermittent fasting.\nThey're doing fast of\nanywhere from 12 to 16 hours,\nevery 24 hour cycle, that's\nactually what my practice is.\nI do that on a regular\nbasis, sometimes the,\nI eat breakfast,\nbut normally I pushed breakfast\nout to about 11 or noon,\nor sometimes a little later,\nsome people are doing longer fast,\nand there are really wonderful data\npublishing excellent\njournals from my colleagues\nSatchin Panda at the Salk\nInstitute Of Biological Studies.\nAnd of course from other\nlaboratories showing that\nintermittent fasting can and\nwill have some positive health\neffects on things like liver health\nand brain health and\nother aspects of health.\nWhether or not it's the\nbest form of dieting\nfor the sake of losing weight,\nthat's very controversial,\nbut it's clear that having\na period of fasting every 24\nhours or perhaps even longer\nfrom time to time can be\nbeneficial because it stimulates\nwhat's called autophagy,\nthe clearing away,\nor the body's ability to\neat certain dead cells,\nso called senescent cells,\nand for many people,\nthey struggle with fasting\nbecause they feel they have a\nvery keen sense of their\nstomach being empty.\nAnd they feel as if they have to eat.\nAnd in a kind of counter-intuitive way,\nthere's some data that\nindicate that being able\nto sense whether or not\nyour gut is full or empty,\nand just the knowledge that\nthat's communicating information\nto your brain about whether to not\nto eat or not just that awareness,\nthat understanding allows\nthem to override the signal.\nThey think, oh, you know,\nI'm not actually in need\nof nutrients right now.\nIt's just that my stomach is empty.\nAnd these piezo receptors,\nand some other ones that I'll\ntell you about in a moment\nare signaling to my brain that it's empty.\nI don't actually need food, it's just,\nit's just that my brain is reacting\nto the fact that my gut is deflated,\nso to speak or a smaller,\ndoesn't have food in it.\nSo there are other ways that\nour guts communicate with our\nbrain, it's not just our\nstomach talking to our brain.\nIt's also our intestines\ntalk to our brain.\nThe Liberles Lab the guy's\nname is Steven Liberles,\nhe runs a lab at Harvard Medical School,\nit's a terrific lab, does excellent work\non gut, brain communication\nand other aspects of\nviscera brain communication.\nThey discovered a category\nof neurons called the GLP1R neurons,\nthese are neurons that are basically\nin your neck, I mean, they're\npart of the nervous system,\nbut they're, you can, they\ncan be found near your neck.\nAnd those neurons send little wires down\ninto the intestines and\ndeep into the stomach,\nbut mostly into the intestines\nand they sense stretch\nof your intestines.\nSo this is pretty wild.\nThese neurons sense how\nstretched out your intestines are\nand how fast things are moving\nthrough your intestines,\nslow or fast, or if there's nothing there.\nAnd then those neurons\nsend another branch,\nthey have a branch in one direction,\nsenses what's going on in your intestines.\nAnd they have another branch that goes up\nfrom your neck in your brain\nto either trigger the desire\nto eat more or just stop eating.\nSo these are really cool neurons\nand they're basically stretch receptors.\nThey look a lot like the piezo receptors\nthat we talked about before,\nso these GLP1R neurons\nare sensing stretch, so\npurely mechanical sensing.\nAnd in addition to that,\nthe Liberles Lab discovered neurons\nthat detect nutrients themselves.\nNow, the main reason why we need\nto eat is to bring\nnutrients into our body.\nAnd there is another set of neurons,\nthose are called GPR65 neurons,\nif you want to know, but you\ndon't have to remember that,\ndo the same thing in terms\nof their connections.\nThey send connections down into\nthe intestines and into the\ngut, into the stomach, but\nmostly into the intestines.\nAnd then send that information back up\nto the brain as to whether or\nnot there are certain kinds\nof nutrients in our digestive track.\nNow, these neurons are the\nones to pay attention to\nif we're talking about chemical signaling\nand then in the next couple of minutes,\nI'm going to tell you about\nhow you can understand hunger\nand had a modulate your\nhunger for the right foods,\nin fact, for healthy foods.\nThe way this is done is\nby leveraging the activity\nof these GPR65 neurons,\nthese neurons that sense nutrients, okay.\nThey're telling your brain\nwhat's in your gut and intestines,\nand you have another set of\nneurons that were discovered\nby another guy he's\nout at Duke University,\nhis name is Diego, excuse me,\nDiego Borges he's a wonderful scientist.\nHe has a degree in nutrition,\nbut also in neuroscience.\nAnd he found that there are\nneurons that line the gut,\nand those neurons in\ncollaboration with these GPR65\nneurons are sensing\nfor three things, okay?\nSo we say nutrients, which\nnutrients are they looking for?\nWhat are these neurons\npaying attention to?\nWhile these neurons are\nactivated by the presence\nof fatty acids in particular,\nomega-3 fatty acids,\nsorts of things that come\nfrom fatty fish, oil, krill,\ncertain kinds of animal protein, animal,\nand plant substances.\nYou can look up what has a\nlot of omega-3s and those\nomega-3s make these neurons\nfire electrically like crazy\nup to the brain and make you\nwant to eat more of those\nthings, but it turns out in\npretty appropriate levels.\nThese neurons also respond to amino acids.\nSo when you eat a food,\nit's broken down in the gut,\nactually the way it's\nbroken down in the gut\nis kind of interesting.\nYour gut basically cinches\noff a sphincter up top,\ncinches off a sphincter below\nit when there's food there.\nAnd then you have a\nseries of smooth muscles\nthat tumble the food and literally\nphysically break it down.\nAnd then of course,\nenzymes come in and\nstart digesting the food.\nAnd we're going to talk about digestion\nand how that's communicated\nto the brain in a moment.\nAnd for those of you with any\nautoimmune issues or digestive\nissues, this is going to be\nvery important conversation.\nBut meanwhile there are these neurons\nin the gut and as these fatty acids\nfloat out of the digested food,\nso literally fat molecules,\nand as amino acids are coming\nfrom the proteins as\nthey're digested in the gut.\nAnd as a third food item,\nsugars are coming from\nthe foods that we eat.\nThese neurons will fire a lot\nto the brain that says, Hey,\nwhatever you're doing up\nthere, do more of it, okay?\nNow the sugars are a\nlittle bit cryptic because\nwhen I say sugars or I say amino acids,\nor I say fatty acids, this\nhas nothing to do with taste.\nIn fact, beautiful\nexperiments have been done\nby the Borges Lab and\nby other labs showing\nthat even if you numb the mouth,\neven if you gavavge,\nwhich is a really, just a,\nit's a fancy word for\nbasically tube feeding,\nyou put a tube down into the gut,\nyou just deliver the food to the gut.\nSo you get no opportunity to\ntaste, it sounds pretty awful.\nIf you force feed by gavage,\nor you numb the mouth,\nthese neurons don't care about the mouth.\nThey only care about the\nnutrients coming from these foods.\nAnd then they signal to the\nbrain, hey, do that thing, do\nthat thing where you lift\nthat object, we call a fork\nor a spoon, do that thing\nwhere you drink the milkshake,\ndo that thing where you\nmove your mouth like this,\nnot talking, but do that\nthing where you swallow.\nSo that's how the nutrients\nin our gut control us.\nAnd this is why for people\nthat experience extreme sugar\ncravings, or even mild sugar cravings,\nreplacing those foods with\nfoods that have high levels\nof omega-3 or amino acids\ncan produce sugar cravings.\nAnd I've talked about this\non a previous episode,\nbut if you didn't catch it, no big deal.\nI'll tell you right now\nthat for many people,\nthe solution to sugar cravings\nis to ingest a small amount,\nmaybe a teaspoon or so of an\namino acid called glutamine.\nAnd if you have really\nextreme sugar cravings,\nyou can even mix that glutamine\nwith a full-fat cream,\nwhich actually makes it\ntaste pretty darn good.\nAnd you drink that anytime\nyou have a sugar craving\nor just a sip or two of that.\nAnd we find is that the\nsugar cravings disappear,\nbecause you're basically\ngiving fat and amino acids\nto those neurons in the\ngut and in the intestine,\nthat signal to the brain\nthat you want more.\nNow, this doesn't give you a kind\nof runaway hunger for full fat cream.\nAlthough it will say when I\nwas in high school for various\nreasons, but mostly because\nI liked the way it tastes.\nI was using half and half in my cereal.\nAnd I was waking up in the\nmiddle of night and drinking half\nand half, and that stuff\ntastes pretty darn good\nonce you get used to the high fat content.\nNot something I do now.\nBut the point is these neurons\ndon't really know taste,\nthey only know nutrients.\nAnd so you can work with that\nsystem if you crave sugar,\nand I do believe that most if\nnot all of us should be trying\nto limit, if not eliminate simple sugars,\nas much as possible most of the time,\nthen things like glutamine,\nthings like high omega-3 foods,\net cetera, maybe even want to supplement\nwith fish oil or something\nsimilar to get omega-3s,\nthere are other reasons\nfor wanting to do that too,\ncan be very beneficial.\nAnd here's what we're talking\nabout is interoception,\nit's your ability to sense\nyour inner real estate,\nbut in this case, by way\nof chemical signaling, not by\nway of mechanical signaling.\nSo now I'd like to talk\nabout another aspect\nof gut chemistry that has profound effects\non the brain, as well\nas on the immune system.\nAnd for those of you with\nauto-immune conditions,\nor for those of you that\nknow people with auto-immune\nconditions, this is going to\nbe a very important discussion.\nYour gut needs to maintain\na certain level of acidity\nor alkalinity, for those of\nyou without any chemistry\nbackground, basically the\nlow numbers on the pH scale,\nthat means more acidic,\nthe higher, the numbers,\nmore alkaline, so more\nalkaline means more basic\nand acidic means acidic.\nAnd it has to do with whom\nhydrogen atoms and all this other\nstuff, but you don't need to\nworry about that right now.\nWe're not going to pH your gut right now,\nbut we are going to talk\nabout the pH of your gut.\nYour gut needs to be more acidic\nthan essentially all other\ntissues of your body in\norder to function properly,\nbacteria thrive in alkaline conditions.\nI think this is important\nfor people to understand.\nPeople are always thinking, oh,\nyou should be more alkaline being acidic,\nthat almost sounds like being\ninflamed at well, you know,\nit's a complicated discussion,\nbut I think the semantics\ncan be confusing,\nsometimes you want your gut to be acidic.\nYou may ask, well, why are\npeople taking antacids?\nWell, those antacids are\nthere for a particular purpose\nto essentially combat acid reflux,\nwhich is the sending up of stuff\nin the gut towards the esophagus.\nAnd it can cause heartburn\nand things of that sort.\nAnd the way the antacids\nwork is they essentially\ncause the sphincters above the gut\nto sinch shut, but they\nreally are only dealing\nwith a symptom, not the cause.\nSo rewind, and about 10, 20 years ago,\nthe discussion about gut acidity\nwas quite a bit different\nthan it is now in the scientific\nand medical literature.\nIn fact, for many years long before,\nI'm going to say it here,\npeople have been saying\nthat it's important to\nmaintain proper acidity\nof the gut, but the science\nand medical professions sort\nof looked at that as kind\nof a scance like, you know,\nwhat's going on there, I don't,\nI don't know that there's any\nevidence that that's actually\ntrue, there are communities of\npeople that were prescribing,\nor I should say recommending\nthat people take hydrochloric\nacid HCL and adjusting\ngut acidity that way.\nAnd it was kind of frowned upon,\nnow in looking over the\npeer reviewed literature,\nit's clear that this business\nof trying to make the gut a\nlittle more acidic is actually one way\nin which people treat or try\nand ameliorate acid reflux.\nSo it's kind of counterintuitive\nincreasing acidity in the\ngut to try and reduce acid\nreflux, thought you're supposed\nto take antacids, well, the\nfield has shifted quite a bit.\nAnd so we're going to review\nwhat it is to maintain the\nchemistry of the gut at a\nslightly more acidic level\nor a more aesthetic level, I should say,\nbecause it turns out\nthat there are a number\nof things that are in gut\nare just call it what it is,\nit's gastric juice, sounds kind of gross.\nBut gastric juices are actually\npowerful modulators of brain state.\nPut differently, one of the best things\nthat you can do to have a healthy brain,\na well-functioning brain\nand a healthy and well-functioning body\nis to maintain proper gut chemistry.\nAnd that's basically accomplished\nby getting the right level\nof acidity and alkalinity in your gut.\nNow this is not quack pseudoscience.\nThis is not based on cleanses\nor anything of that sort.\nWell, we're going to talk about\nnow are peer reviewed data\nin very high quality journals,\nlike the Journal Cell,\nwhich is one of the three\napex science nature, so,\nand journals of that sort,\nthat point to the gut\nmicrobiome and its relationship\nto acidity of the gut and how\nthe gut microbiome can help\nenhance auto-immune function\nand various other aspects\nof brain and body health.\nSo within all the mucosal\nlining tissues of our body,\nwe have what are called\nmicrobiota, little micro organisms\nthat we didn't make that actually come\nfrom our environment or our\nfood and live inside us.\nAnd there are good microbiota\nand there are bad microbiota\nwhether or not we have good microbiota\nor bad microbiota depends on one thing.\nAnd that one thing is how acid or alkaline\nthe given mucosal tissue is.\nSo we actually have a\nmicrobiome in our nose.\nAnd just as a very brief aside,\nbecause I'd be remiss\nif I didn't say this,\nif you emphasize nasal breathing most\nof the time, except\nwhen speaking or eating.\nAnd if you downplay mouth breathing,\nmeaning you refrain from mouth breathing,\nespecially in sleep, you\nimprove the nasal microbiome.\nIt gets better at fighting off infections.\nThis was shown in a beautiful paper,\npublished in Cell Reports last year.\nAnd that paper I should mention\nwas performed in humans.\nSo you've got a microbiome in your nose\nand my nasal breathing most\nof the time, not all the time.\nCause there going to be times\nwhen you need to breathe\nthrough your mouth\nfor whatever reason, hard exercise\nor eating or speaking, but by\nbreathing through your nose,\nmost of the time you are\ncreating an additional layer of\nimmune defense against particles\nthat could get you sick.\nWhereas when you mouth breathe,\nyou are taking down a layer of defense\nand you are putting yourself\nmore at risk of infection.\nThis is what this paper shows.\nYou also have a gut microbiome that is\nin your throat, in your\nstomach and in your intestines.\nAnd that gut microbiome\nis extremely powerful\nin regulating your mood\nand your immune function.\nNow, this is not something\nthat you can sense directly.\nYou don't know when you have a\nbunch of good microbiota or a\nbunch of bad microbiota because\nyou can feel them moving\naround in there, actually\nthat would be pretty awful,\nthat would be pretty creepy feeling.\nRather that according to whether\nor not your gut is alkaline\nor acidic in the appropriate ways,\nyou will populate your gut with\nthe appropriate microbiota.\nSo you want your stomach\nto be pretty acidic,\nbut other elements of your digestive tract\nare going to be more pH.\nAnd basically there's a gradient,\nmeaning there's a low to high\npH gradient along the gut.\nYou don't have to know what the pH\nshould be at any one given point,\nbecause you're not going\nto go and put microbiota\nat one location and not another.\nWhat you essentially want to\ndo is create an environment\nwhere the proper can thrive,\nbecause when you do that,\nyou greatly decrease what are\ncalled inflammatory cytokines.\nSo these are things that\nare secreted both by cells,\nwithin the body and cells\nwithin the brain to impact brain\nhealth and brain function\nand bodily health.\nThey go by particular name,\nso there's something called\nTNF alpha, Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha.\nIt is inflammatory.\nIt's not a good thing to\nhave at elevated levels.\nYou have something called\nInterleukin Six, IL-6\nalso causes inflammation,\ncauses damage to tissues,\nnot a good thing to have\nelevated for long periods of time.\nAnd then you have\nanti-inflammatory cytokines,\nthings like Interleukin 10,\nwhich reduce inflammation.\nAnd there are hundreds of these,\nif not thousands of these\ndifferent cytokines,\nsome of which promote inflammation,\nsome of which reduce inflammation.\nThe simple way to adjust these\nthings in the proper ratios\nis to adjust your gut microbiome.\nThe best way to adjust your microbiome is\nto ingest certain types of foods.\nSo there is a beautiful literature\non this now, but the most\nimportant literature is the one\nthat I referred to at the\nbeginning of this episode,\nwhich is what to ingest\nand what not to ingest\nin terms of foods in order\nto create the best conditions\nin your gut so that you can\ncreate the best conditions\nin your brain and body.\nThere was a study done by my colleague,\nJustin Sonnenberg at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nJustin's actually my upstairs neighbor\nin the building at Stanford where I work\nand they explored how different foods\nor different diets, I should say,\nimpact the gut microbiome\nand inflammatory markers.\nAnd this is a beautiful\nstudy because it was done\nin hundreds of human patients.\nThese actually weren't\npatients that were sick,\nI should say human subjects\nthat were otherwise healthy\nfrom a huge variety of\nbackgrounds, so you had men,\nyou had women, you had people\nof different races, different ethnicities.\nYou had a huge range of backgrounds\nand they tracked all of that.\nAnd what they did is they\nexplored two types of diets.\nOne is a high fiber diet.\nSo dietary fibers are\nnon-digestible are only partially\ndigestible carbohydrates typically.\nAnd they compared that to diets\nthat were unchanged, except\nfor the inclusion of a few,\nto a few more servings of\nfermented foods, each day,\nthings like sauerkraut,\nthings like kimchi,\nthey even explored, it\nsounds pretty disgusting\nto me, but who knows, I've never tried it,\nwhich is fermented cottage cheese.\nAnd what they found was\nthat after initial period\nof a few weeks, where they\nhad people either eat a lot\nof fiber or eat one or two\nservings of fermented foods,\nthey had those people ramp\nup their ingestion of either\nfiber or fermented foods, so\nthey kind of ease them into it.\nAs they went baseline then ramp up\nto the point where they\nwere ingesting, you know,\nfour or five servings of fiber or\nof fermented foods per day,\nwhich sounds like a lot.\nBut for fermented foods,\nthat would be, you know,\nfour or five tablespoons\nof sauerkraut or kimchi.\nIt's not quite,\nit's not like huge platefuls\nof fermented foods.\nAnd then they looked\nat a number of things.\nThey looked at the proteome,\nwhich is a kind of like\nlooking at the genome,\nbut a bunch of proteins\nthat are made in the body.\nAnd they did this by fecal\nsamples, by stool samples,\nand they did this by blood\ndraw, which is great,\nit's a real power of this study.\nIn fact, the most comprehensive\nstudy that I'm aware of.\nBy looking at these different\ntissues across long periods\nof time, so many weeks, and\nthen returning people to their,\nto the diet that they were\non before they went into the\nstudy, they will were able\nto establish in a causal way,\nhow ingesting fibers or fibrous\nfoods versus ingesting these\nfermented foods on a daily\nbasis could impact the gut\nmicrobiome and many inflammatory markers\nand many markers of immune function\nand auto immune function.\nAnd the takeaway message\nfrom this study is that the\nfermented foods far out\nperformed the high fiber diet.\nIn fact, the high fiber diet\nin some people was beneficial\nand in other people caused\nissues with inflammation.\nThis is very different than\nwhat I was taught growing up\nand what many of us were taught.\nInterestingly they also\nobserved that people\nthat ate the high fiber diet\nhad increases in certain enzymes\nthat lend themselves to better\ndigestion of carbohydrates.\nAnd I think there's an important\ninsight to come from this.\nNowadays we kind of live\nin the age of extremes\nwhere people seem to\neither want to be carnivore\nor like never ingest a vegetable,\nI hear they don't even like allow pepper,\nbut they're not even allowed, you know,\nsauerkraut or something like very extreme\nor pure plant based, pure vegan or pure.\nSo essentially pure carbohydrate\nor pure animal protein, very extreme.\nI'm an omnivore, I like to eat a mixture\nof different things at\ndifferent times of days,\nbut very extreme, but this is\ninteresting because what this,\nwhat these data show is that\nperhaps ingesting a high\ncarbohydrate high fiber diet,\nwhich is really what these,\nthe high-fiber condition really was\nactually makes people better\nat digesting carbohydrates.\nThis may explain\nwhy people who are used to\na, kind of a more paleo type\nor carnivore type diet\nmight eat carbohydrates\nand say, oh, that doesn't work\nfor me, I don't feel good.\nIt might also explain why\npeople who predominantly eat\nplant-based foods and carbohydrate foods\nwill try eating meat as an experiment,\nor because they lost a\nbet or whatever it is\nand they'll do or desperation,\nor they'll do that.\nAnd then they'll say, oh, I\ndon't feel good when I eat meat.\nHow good you feel,\nit seems how well you\ncan utilize that food,\nand how much of that food\nyou crave may be determined\nin fact, it appears is determined\nby your food eating history,\nthe types of food you eat.\nAnd I think this might\nexplain some of the divide\nand hopefully might bridge\nsome of the chasm between these\ndifferent groups that are\nsaying it should be one way,\nor it should be another.\nBut at the core of the study\nwas the bigger message.\nThe bigger message is that\nall of us should be ingesting\non a regular basis, daily basis,\ntwo to four servings of fermented\nfoods of different kinds.\nAnd why I say that is because\nthe inflammatory markers went down,\nthe markers of auto-immune\ndisruption went down,\nand the chemistry of the\ngut therefore was adjusted\nin the appropriate ways.\nNow it's not to say that high fiber is bad\nor that fiber is bad, I don't want people\nto confuse this, but even\nthough this is a discussion\nabout interoception,\nabout sensing the self.\nThis is a subconscious\nmechanism by which the gut\ncommunicates to many\norgans, including the brain.\nAnd it's been shown in other\nstudies also in quality peer\nreview journals that when\nthe correct gut microbiota\nare present and these\ninflammatory markers are reduced,\ncognition improves so ability to focus,\nability to sleep ability\nto ward off infection\nand wound healing all enhanced,\nin fact, even in autism spectrum disorder,\nin people that struggle with\nvarious mental conditions\nor disorders of the mind\nimproving the gut microbiome seems\nto have powerful effects on\nimproving brain symptoms.\nAlong the lines of auto-immunity,\nthere are a number of conditions\nthat we call auto-immune conditions,\nand we will do entire episodes\nabout these going forward.\nBut for people with so-called\nirritable bowel syndrome,\nfor people with Crohn's disease,\nfor people with leaky gut, Hashimoto's,\nwhich is a kind of an\nimmune system self-attack\non one's thyroid gland\nand things like eczema,\nskin conditions, adjusting the\ngut microbiome has been shown\nto be useful in positively\nadjusting the symptoms\nof all of those, will it fix\nthose conditions entirely?\nProbably not.\nBut can it have a significant\npositive impact on them?\nProbably, yes.\nThere is one thing that's worth mentioning\nin that list, which is leaky\ngut, what is leaky gut.\nHere, we're talking about the guts,\nwhat is it to have a leaky\ngut, it sounds awful.\nIt sounds like something sort\nof like leaking out the end\nof the tube, and it maybe\nthat too, I don't know.\nBut leaky gut is actually\nbecause, your gut is not a tube\nthat's continuous, one\ncell it's actually made up\nof many cells and those\ncells form a barrier\nand they form what are\ncalled tight junctions.\nIf you have two cells and you\nwant to create a fence out\nof those cells, you bind them together.\nThe way that the body does\nthis is to bind them together\nwith what are called tight\njunctions, these are,\nthey go by names like\nclaudins and things like that,\nif you want to look them up.\nThese tight junctions form a nice barrier,\nlike a cyclone fence, that\nthings can't get past,\nbut like a cyclone fence only\nmolecules of a certain size\ncan go through those holes.\nSo you're not going to pass a soccer ball\nthrough an intact cyclone\nfence, but you could pass\nfor instance, a feather\nthrough that fence.\nSo leaky gut is when the\nconditions in the gut are\ntoo alkaline or the gut\nmicrobiota are off in the gut,\nmeaning microbiota that like\nalkaline guts are living there.\nAnd those tight junctions can't\nfunction at that particular\npH and you create little\nholes in that fence.\nAnd then what happens is\nwhen you ingest foods,\nsome of those foods\nliterally leak out of the gut\nand into the extracellular\nspace and into the bloodstream.\nAnd because foods include proteins\nand antibodies react to proteins,\nwhat ends up happening in leaky gut,\nand the reason we talk about\nin auto-immune conditions is\nthat you start developing antibodies\nto particular food proteins.\nAnd then people start feeling\nlike they have food allergies\nand they do, they actually\ncreate particular food allergies.\nNow, one way to prevent\nleaky gut is to get the rest\nof the gut situation happy\nby ingesting the proper foods\nthat we talked about before,\ningesting fermented\nfoods on a regular basis.\nThe other is our old\nfriend glutamine, again.\nThere are some data and I\nshould say it's a limited number\nof studies showing that\ningesting glutamine anywhere\nfrom one to three, excuse\nme, teaspoons per day,\ncan help alleviate leaky gut.\nNow, the mechanism for that\nstill isn't clear whether\nor not it's adjusting pH or\nwhether or not it's creating\nmore favorable environment\nfor the microbiota,\nbut it is clear that\nsupplementing with glutamine can,\nin some people enhance where I\nshould say improve conditions\nof leaky gut, so that\nmight be useful as well.\nAnd then the final thing about this,\nI want to talk about is we're\ntalking about chemical sensing\nin the gut and how that\nimpacts wellbeing is about gut\nacidity, and this I confess\nis a little bit controversial.\nSome people are on board,\nthis other people are not.\nAnd so I'd love your feedback\non this, if you, if you agree,\nplease tell me if you\ndisagree, please tell me,\nbut please tell me why you\ndisagree in particular,\nexperience or data,\nalthough it's always better\nif you can point me towards\npeer reviewed studies.\nThere is a practice that\nsome people embrace.\nI'm not recommending\npeople necessarily do this.\nAnd you would definitely\nwant to talk to your doctor,\nbut where people have food\nallergies or they're having mood\nor auto-immune issues,\nand they treat this,\nsome people recommend treating this\nthrough the ingestion of HCL,\nhydrochloric acid tablets.\nNow hydrochloric acid can burn you, right?\nAcids can burn you, they\nliterally can melt away skin.\nYou want to be very careful\nwith acids of all kinds, truly,\nbut hydrochloric acid is sold\nas in supplement form\nin capsule or pill form.\nAnd there is a practice\nof starting to ingest one\nor two hydrochloric acid\ntablets midway through a meal\nand then what people will\ngenerally do is examine to see\nwhether or not that improves\ntheir symptoms of indigestion,\nhow it relates to mood, how\nit relates to well-being,\nhow it relates to their\nsensation of their gut viscera.\nBy changing the acidity,\nyou also changed the way\nthat the gut communicates with the brain\nthrough the mechanisms\nwe talked about before.\nAnd there are a growing number\nof people embracing these\npractices of taking HCL.\nIt's often combined with other\nthings, it's usually combined\nwith an enzyme and that enzyme is pepsin.\nSo most of these\nsupplements come in the form\nbetaine HCL pepsin and while\nthey're not a cure-all,\nand certainly don't want to\nsuggest that they're a cure-all,\nmany people that have a hard\ntime adjusting the pH of\ntheir gut and have a hard time\nadjusting the microbiota of\ntheir gut in the appropriate\nways have benefited from taking\nthese betaine HCL pepsin tablets\nor capsules during meals.\nAnd the general instruction is\nto start slow, to start with one or two,\nand then to find a level\nthat you're comfortable with\nthat doesn't create an\nexcessive feeling of warmth\nin the stomach, it doesn't\nthrow off your digestion.\nSo it takes a little bit\nof experimentation, again,\ndefinitely talk to your\nhealthcare provider\nbefore exploring this,\nbut this has become a very\ncommon practice for people with\nauto-immune disorders and\naccessing the gut because it is\naccessible by taking things\nhas also become way in which\npeople with various mental\nconditions are trying to adjust\ntheir mood and adjust their wellbeing.\nAlong these lines,\nI do want to mention that\nthere are studies that show\nthat people that supplement\nwith a lot of probiotics\nor even prebiotics can\nsometimes experience brain fog.\nThis isn't discussed a lot\nand the data are a little\nall over the place,\nbut it is that we're thinking about.\nThe goal here is not to\ncreate as many microbiota\nas possible, what you want\nis microbiota diversity.\nAnd I should mention this again\nin reference to the Sonnenberg study,\nwhich was what the high fiber diet does\nis it increases certain microbiota,\nbut it limits their diversity\nand what the fermented food diet does,\nor I should say the diet that\nincludes regular ingestion\nof fermented foods a few servings a day\nis it increases microbiota diversity.\nNow, lack of microbiota diversity\nhas a name in the medical profession.\nIt's called dysbiosis\nand dysbiosis is bad.\nDysbiosis is what you see\nwhen people are spending long\nperiods of time on bedrest\nor when they've been chronically\nill, and so here again,\nwe're talking about creating\na positive environment\nin the gut, either by adjusting acidity,\nmaybe you explore the\nbetaine HCL pepsin thing.\nI think if you have healthy digestion,\nif you feel like you\nhave a good relationship\nto your gut, and it has a\ngood relationship to you,\nsort of a silly phrase, because\nit is you and you are it,\nthen I don't think there's\nany need to pursue this,\nbut if you don't, that might\nbe one avenue to pursue.\nHowever I think primary in all\nof this is the fermented food findings,\nand it's not just one study,\nit's many many findings\nthat now bring us to a place where a huge\ncenter of massive data are\npointing us in the direction\nof saying ingest fermented\nfoods on a regular basis.\nI should also mention that\nconditions like sarcopenia,\nwhich is the loss of\nmuscle tissue as we age,\nhas been shown to be offset by\nimproving the gut microbiota.\nSo while today is\nabout interoception, we're\ntalking about sensing,\nwe're also talking about\nsubconscious sensing.\nWhat are we talking about,\nsubconscious sensing,\nwe're talking about subconscious sensing\nof the milieu of the body.\nWhen the milieu of the\ngut and the body is right,\nthan the brain and the immune\nsystem function very well.\nAnd so this isn't something\nwhere you can sit back\nand say, oh, you know, I feel\nall those good microbiota\nin my gut, or, oh, no,\nthose are bad microbiota.\nYou can't do that unless you're\ngoing to take fecal samples\nand blood samples and analyze them\nin the, with the extreme exhaustive nature\nthat the Sonnenberg and other labs do,\nyou're not going to get\nthat kind of information.\nI know there are companies out there\nthat do this, and I don't\nwant to knock on any\nof them, but I do want to\nemphasize that to do this right,\nto really analyze which\ncytokines you're making,\nwhich ones you're not,\nyou really need to look\nat a huge number of them.\nAnd that requires large-scale proteomic\nand genomic and inflammatory\nmarkers screens.\nIt's just not the kind of\nthing that most commercial\nenterprises can really provide\nto people in a way that\nthey can interpret, rather,\nthis is a case where you can\nsimply go to the effector,\nto the thing that can\nactually move the needle\nin the right direction for you.\nIt's very clear that's fermented\nfoods and that's keeping\nthe stomach slightly more acid\nthan one might think you would want to.\nSo let's talk about barfing first.\nBarfing, AKA vomiting, is when\nthe contents of your guts run\nin reverse, meaning when\nthey go up from your stomach.\nSometimes even up from the intestines,\neven though that sounds horrible,\nit sometimes happens up,\nout the esophagus and mouth\nand onto whatever surface\nhappens to be in front of you.\nIt's a terrible thing,\nnobody likes to do it,\nbut it's a very interesting\naspect of our biology because it\nreveals a beautiful and absolutely\nfundamental relationship\nbetween our chemistry and our brain.\nSo your brain is actually\nlocked behind a gate\nand that gate is not your skull.\nThat gate is the so-called\nblood-brain barrier.\nSo just like your gut has these\nepithelial tight junctions,\nthe things I talked about\nbefore that provide a fence,\nso things can't get through\nand get through in leaky gut,\nyour brain has tight\njunctions that are very tight.\nIt's absolutely fundamental\nthat only certain molecules get\nacross the blood brain\nbarrier and that others don't.\nAnd the reason for that is\nthat most all 99.99999% of your\nneurons do not regenerate, I\ndon't care what you've read,\nespecially in the news recently\nabout how psychedelics cause\nneurogenesis, because they\ndon't, it's absolutely wrong.\nPsychedelics have effects\non brain plasticity, but they have nothing\nto do with neurogenesis, at least no data\nto support it, but because\nyou can't make new neurons,\nyou also can't damage the ones you've got,\nor you shouldn't as much as possible.\nAnd that's why you have a\nblood brain barrier or a BBB.\nSo the BBB as it's called\nprevents substances\nfrom getting to the brain,\nhowever, like any fence,\nit is not always uniform along its length.\nAnd there are little spots\nwithin that fence where chemicals\ncan sneak across to the\nbrain and through a beautiful\ndesign, I don't know\nanything about the design.\nAs I always say, I wasn't\nconsulted the design phase.\nI'm not talking about any\nkind of intelligent design\nor anything that is not\nthe topic of this podcast.\nThis is not a philosophy podcast,\nnor is it a religion podcast,\nit's a science podcast,\nbut through a beautiful design\nof some sort, there are\nlittle holes in that fence.\nAnd they're little neurons that\nsit right behind those holes\nand those neurons sense what\nthe chemistry of the blood is.\nSo I'm guessing you probably\ndidn't imagine that today's\ndiscussion about sensing the self\nwould be sensing your\nown blood, but you do.\nThere's a little area of your\nbrain, that's little indeed,\nbut is very important called area postrema\nP-O-S-T-R-E-M-A.\nAnd area postrema is an\narea of the brainstem\nthat sits right next to another brain area\ncalled the chemo receptor trigger zone.\nAnd when the contents in your bloodstream\nare of a particular kind,\nmeaning when there are\npathogens or it's too acidic,\nthe neurons and area postrema the neurons\nin the chemo receptor trigger\nzone, the CTZ as it's called,\ntrigger a bunch of motor\nreflexes in the abdominal wall\nthat make you barf.\nOkay, the feeling that you\nneed to throw up is triggered\nby these neurons in the brain stem.\nAnd those neurons in the\nbrainstem are triggered\nby the presence of certain chemicals.\nAnd the reason why you don't\nhave any blood brain barrier at\nthat location is because\npost-trauma has to be there\nlike a crossing guard,\nmaking sure that everything\nthat's coming through the blood\nis okay, and if it even\nsenses just the tiniest bit,\nthat things are off, it's\ngoing to trigger that reflex.\nNow, the really interesting thing is\nthat the neurons and area\npostrema respond to the chemistry\nof the blood, but they also will respond\nto our consciousness,\nto things that we think\nand things that we believe\nand even particular memories.\nThis is why when certain people see vomit\nor see someone else vomit, or\neven somebody else heaving,\nas if they're going to vomit,\nthey themselves feel as\nif they're going to vomit.\nI'm guessing they're probably\neven a few of you right now\nthat feel like you might vomit.\nYou might feel salivation in your throat,\nwhich is always a precursor to vomiting.\nSome people, the memory of,\nor the thought of something\nlike blood or vomit or,\nuse your imagination, can\nactually trigger the vomit reflex.\nAnd that's because these neurons\nin area are very sensitive\nto prior experience of\ninteractions with negative things.\nSo and actually, as I'm saying this,\nI feel my gut kind of\ncramping up again, I'm not,\nI don't vomit very easily, I'm not one\nof those, nor am I somebody\nwho's never vomited.\nAnd here we are talking\nabout my vomit history,\nbut I think it's appropriate\nin this, in this context,\nthe neurons of area,\nor they're basically to keep\nyour whole system safe and\nthank goodness they are, because\nfor instance, some people,\nunfortunately, they drink so much alcohol\nthat they throw up.\nHave you ever wondered why that is?\nWell it's because alcohol\nfundamentally is a poison.\nI'm not saying for, you know,\nage appropriate folks that\ningesting alcohol is bad.\nThis isn't a judgment call,\nbut alcohol itself at excessive levels\nin the bloodstream triggers\npost-trauma to cause vomiting.\nSo this is an example,\nwhereby memories, context,\nbut also just the chemistry\nof our internal state\nis triggering behaviors\nthat are very hardwired.\nThey're very reflux driven.\nAnd why would it be that\nsome people get more nauseous\nthan others at a given level, well,\nthey'll have to do with alcohol tolerance.\nSome people have what's\ncalled a, you know,\nwe refer to as a stronger\nstomach or a stomach of steel.\nOther people they throw out very easily\nif they don't feel well,\nor if they ingest anything\nthat's just a little bit off.\nFrom a purely adaptive standpoint,\nit's probably better to vomit up things\nthat aren't good for you\nrather than to have them\npass through your system.\nEspecially if those things\nare contained in lipids.\nFor instance if you ingest something\nthat's in liquid form because cells,\nliterally every cell in\nyour body is surrounded\nby a little thin layer\nof fatty tissue, we call\nthe bilayer membrane,\nit's a little membrane.\nFat can move through fat very easily.\nAnd so any bad stuff you ingest\ncan get stuck in your system.\nSo let's talk for a second about\nhow to reduce nausea, because\nnausea is that salivation,\nthat feeling that you're\ngoing to vomit, can be very\nbeneficial in an, in an\nadaptive circumstance.\nLike you've ingested something bad,\nbut some people experience\nnausea, for other reasons,\nthere are good ways to regulate nausea\nand the ways they regulate\nnausea, very interesting.\nThey actually adjust the activity\nof these neurons in area postrema\nor they change the chemistry\nof the blood directly.\nAnd many of you have heard\nthis before, perhaps,\nbut it turns out that there are good data,\n11 research studies where the\nones that I could find peer\nreviewed research studies with no bias,\nso independent studies showing that ginger\ncan cause a notable reduction in nausea,\nhow much ginger, one to three grams,\nwhat's one to three grams where\nyou have to measure it out\non a scale, unless you're taking\nit in pill or capsule form.\nIt doesn't seem to matter if you take it\nin pill or capsule form, so\nthis thing that you've heard\nbefore that ginger can reduce\nnausea, indeed is true.\nPeppermint, apparently can also do that.\nAnd some of you will not be\nsurprised to learn that cannabis\ncan reduce nausea, not\nsurprise because cannabis,\nwhich has different legality\nin different places,\nand I understand that,\nso please take that into consideration.\nBut cannabis, THC and, or it turns out CBD\ncan reduce nausea,\nthat's been shown in at least one study.\nAnd it probably does that,\nnot by changing the chemistry\nof your blood, but by\nchanging the threshold\nfor firing of these neurons\nin area post-trauma.\nAnd there are conditions\nsuch as in chemotherapy and\nradiation therapy and others\nwhere people are feeling very\nnauseous, I'm not recommending\npeople go use cannabis,\nunless they've decided with their selves\nand their family and their\ndoctor that they should.\nBut what's interesting\nis this thing about CBD\nand we'll do a whole episode\non THC and CBD doesn't have,\nor isn't supposed to have\nthese psychoactive properties\nthat THC does.\nAlthough CBD can have a\nmild to major anxiolytic\nanxiety-reducing effect,\nbut it does appear that the\ndata are what the data support.\nI should say, the anecdotal reports,\nwhich are that cannabis can reduce nausea.\nSo to barf less, ginger, peppermint,\nand if appropriate and legal\nfor you, possibly cannabis.\nNow let's talk about fever.\nIn previous episodes,\nand in future episodes,\nwe deal with thermal regulation,\nwhich is the body's ability\nto regulate its temperature.\nTalk about cold and heat\nand saunas and ice baths\nand physical performance.\nWe're not going to deal\nwith all that right now,\nbut I promise we will going forward.\nToday, I only want to talk about fever\nbecause fever directly\nrelates to interoception.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, a fever is simply an\nincrease in body temperature,\nthat increase in body\ntemperature is triggered\nby neurons in the brain.\nAnd those neurons in\nthe brain are triggered\nby the presence of particular\nthings in the bloodstream.\nWhat sorts of things?\nWell, toxins, bacteria, viruses,\nwhen something bad gets in our system,\nthe body doesn't know it's bad,\nit just knows it's foreign,\nand it hasn't seen it before.\nOr that it's in the wrong\ncompartment of the body.\nSo earlier we were talking about proteins\nthat leak out of the gut\nand get elsewhere, you know,\nyou don't want a piece of\nsteak sitting in your bicep.\nThat would be bad, you would\nactually develop antibodies,\nyou would have a horrible infection.\nBut your body has this intelligence,\nand that intelligence is to know, Hmm,\nthese proteins are normally\nnot seen in this region\nand then your body or the\ncells there, I should say,\nwe'll release something that\nthen will travel to the brain\nand will trigger an increase\nin body temperature so that\nyour body cooks the bad thing\nor the cause of the bad thing.\nIt's really a beautiful\nadaptive mechanism.\nWe always think fever is so terrible,\nbut fever is there to cook the\nbad thing that's inside you,\nor that has left the correct\ncompartment inside you\nand is in the wrong\ncompartment inside you.\nSo what's beautiful about\nthe fever mechanism is\nthat it looks a lot like\nthe barfing mechanism.\nBasically you have a set of\nneurons that sit near the\nventricles, remember the\nventrals is hole in the tube,\nthat is you, the tube\nthat is, you are a tube,\na series of tubes.\nAnd your brain has a hole down the middle.\nAnd it extends down to the\nbottom of your spinal cord,\nat the front, it's called the ventricles,\nthey start with what are\ncalled the lateral ventricles\nand the excuse me,\nstarts with the third and\nthe lateral ventricles,\nand then it goes to the fourth ventricle\nand then to what's\ncalled the central canal.\nBut basically is just a\nbig space in the middle\nof your nervous system in\nthe middle of your brain.\nAnd you have one ventricle\nthat I already mentioned\ncalled the third ventricle.\nAnd it's shaped kind of\nlike a thin oval up upright,\nif you're listening to\nthis, just think an I,\nthe shape of an I, but it's\nkind of rotated 90 degrees.\nSo it's up and down as opposed to across.\nAnd along that third ventricle,\nthere's there a little\nneurons that can sense what's\nin the cerebral spinal fluid\nthat fills the ventricle.\nSo in other words,\nyou have neurons that\nare sensing the chemistry\nof your cerebral spinal fluid,\nand that have access therefore\nto the chemistry of your body.\nBecause that cerebral\nspinal fluid is going up\nand down the brain and spinal cord.\nBut into that cerebral\nspinal fluid are signals\nabout the various\nchemicals within the body.\nSo this is not a mechanical system.\nThis is a chemical system.\nRemember we're talking\nabout mechanical information\nand chemical information\naccessing the brain.\nSo if you have something bad\nin your system, you've ingested a,\nyou breathe in a virus or\nyou inhaled some bacteria,\nor you got a cut on your leg\nand some bacteria are growing there.\nOf course, locally, there will be effects,\nlittle things called the mast cell.\nThis M-A-S-T little packets\nof histamine literally\nwill go there and explode\n[poofs] and cause inflammation,\nwhich is actually a good inflammation.\nAnd we'll release little things\ncalled macrophages to\ngobble up the infection.\nThe other day, it was\nin Texas, it was some\nmean little mosquitoes in\nTexas, and a lot of them,\nand I would stand outside\nand I'd get bitten,\nI didn't feel a thing,\nbut then later that night,\nthey started swelling up and itching\nand then I'd itch them, and\nthen they'd swell even more.\nThat was because of the release\nof mass cells, of histamines\ninside those mass cells\nthat would literally causing\ninflammation of the tissue.\nIt wasn't the poison\nfrom the mosquito itself.\nIt was the immune response to those.\nWell, you also have this systemic\nor body-wide attempt to kill\nstuff, and that's the fever.\nSo the neurons that these\nventricles with cerebral spinal\nfluid go by a particular\nname, they're called\ncircumventricular organs,\nmeaning near circum,\nventricular near the ventricles.\nAnd you have these organs\nand there are a set\nof neurons, has a really\ncool name called the OVLT.\nI don't know why I like\nthat, but I just like it,\nit's the organum vasculosum\nof the lateral terminalis\norganum vasculosum of the\nlateral terminalis, OVLT\nare the neurons that respond to toxins\nand bad stuff in your bloodstream,\nhowever minor or major.\nAnd they release things like ILK-1,\nwhich are inflammatory cytokines\ninflammatory in this case\nis good, you want inflammation\nat the site of an infection.\nIt's a good thing.\nIt's going to help with healing.\nAnd it's going to change\nthe conditions in your body,\nwhat's going to happen is\nwhen those OVLT neurons are activated,\nbecause you have\nsomething bad in your body\nor something bad is\nhappening in your body,\nthey communicate with an\narea of the brain called the\npreoptic area of your\nhypothalamus and the preoptic area\ncranks up your temperature and\ntries to cook that bad thing.\nNow it's worth talking about fever\nfor a moment and talking\nabout thermal regulation,\nbecause I think this actually\ncould save some lives.\nSo if you are overheated\nto a point where, you know,\nyou're getting up past 102\nor 103, it's going to vary depending\non person to person and\ncertainly age, you know, kids,\nsome people think can\ntolerate higher levels\nof fever than adults, but look,\nyou always want to be cautious\nabout heating up the brain\ntoo much, because once\nthose neurons are gone,\nthey do not come back and\nneurons do not do well\nin very high temperatures.\nOnce your body temperature\nstarts getting up\nto 102, 103, certainly 104,\nyou are starting to enter\nserious danger zone.\nThis can happen through\nexercise in hot environments\nor an inability to escape heat\nbecause you don't have covering\nor adequate ventilation or cooling.\nIt can also be because of excessive fever,\nfor whatever reason.\nA lot of people think the way\nto deal with this is to put a\ncool compress on the back of\nthe neck or to cool the torso.\nIn discussing this with\nmy colleague, Craig Heller\nwho's at Stanford School of Medicine,\nand he's on the undergraduate side\nof the campus as well, runs a biology lab.\nHe's a world expert in thermal regulation.\nIt's very clear that\nthat's the wrong response\nto try and cool off the body.\nIf you put a cold towel\nor you put an ice pack\non the back of the neck, what\nyou effectively do is cool\nthe blood that's going to the brain.\nAnd if you do that,\nthen your brain will react\nby turning up the crank\nin so to speak on the neurons\nin the pre optic area,\nand will heat you up further\nand can cook your brain\nand organs further.\nSo what you want to do is, as I've talked\nabout before, you want to\ncool the bottoms of the feet,\nthe palms of the hands and\nthe upper part of the face.\nAnd I'm not going to\ngo into all the details\nas to why you want to do that right now,\nbut those are the\nlocations you want to cool.\nNow you can also cool\nthe rest of the body,\nbut it's not okay to just\nstay under the covers\nand just cool, you know, the\nneck or something like that.\nYou really want to try\nand create a systemic\nor whole body cooling, if the\ngoal is to bring fever down,\nbut in many cases, fever is adaptive.\nAnd so taking a non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs\nlike Advil and Tylenol\nsometimes can be good,\nif that's recommended,\nbut other times, because\nit reduces your fever,\nit's allowing that pathogen,\nthat pyrogen, it's sometimes called,\na pyrogen is a substance\nthat causes fever,\nthink pyro, think fire, think\npyromaniacs, think pyro,\nthose pyrogens can survive at\nmoderate to low temperatures,\nand they can't survive\nat high temperatures.\nSo the fever is an adaptive\nmechanism and the OVLT,\nand the sensing of your\nchemistry is how the OVLT,\norganum vasculosum of the\nlateral terminalis does that.\nSo we've talked about sensing lung volume,\nspeed of our heartbeat,\nwe talked about sensing the gut volume,\nthe intestinal volume,\nor the absence of volume.\nWe talked about chemistry of\nthe gut and the gut microbiota\nand auto immune functions.\nAnd we've now talked about\nvomiting, and we've talked\nabout fever, lots of aspects\nof sensing our internal self.\nNow I want to turn our attention\nto interoception as it\nrelates to feelings,\nthe way that interoception\nis most commonly described.\nAnd I want to highlight a term that many\nof you have probably heard,\nwhich is the vagus nerve.\nWe talked about vagus\na little bit earlier,\nbut the vagus nerve, this\nvagabonding wandering nerve\nis involved in everything I've\ntalked about up until now.\nAnd the reason I saved it till now,\nrather than mentioning all\nalong is to highlight a specific\npoint, which is that whenever\nwe hear about the vagus\nin popular culture, it's like\nthe vagus calms you down,\nyou want to stimulate the vagus by rubbing\nin front of the ear, and\nit's a parasympathetic nerve,\nand it will calm you down,\nhe'll mellow you out.\nActually, most of the time,\nthe vagus is stimulatory.\nWhen you ingest foods\nwith amino acids, sugars,\nor fatty acids,\nthe vagus nerve gets activated\nand triggers the release of dopamine,\nit makes you more alert and go seek more\nof those foods or what\nled to those conditions.\nWhen you feel nauseous\nit's rarely calming,\nwhen you feel like you have\na fever, it's rarely calming.\nSo you're starting to\nget the picture that even\nthough the vagus nerve is in\nthe parasympathetic branch\nof the autonomic nervous system.\nAnd if that doesn't mean anything to you,\nbecause you're not in\naficionado, don't worry about it.\nBut it's not a calming system,\nit's a communication system,\nand it's a motor system.\nIt communicates brain to\nbody and body to brain,\nand it changes the function\nof different organs, now,\none thing that's important\nto highlight is that stress\nitself will alter the\nchemistry of your gut\nbecause of the ways that\nit down the vagus nerve\nand quiets the neurons that\ncommunicate from gut to brain.\nI want to say that again,\nstress will disrupt your gut\nand make you feel not\ngood, poor digestion,\nand just lousy, because\nof the way that it shuts\ndown the vagus nerve and\nthe neurons of your gut.\nSo what stress does is it\nblocks the communication\nbetween gut and brain, it\ndoesn't mess up your gut.\nIt just doesn't let your\ngut get the signals up\nto your brain, and it also\nthen throws off the chemistry.\nAnd then there's a whole\ncascade of effects.\nIf you want to learn more about stress,\nI did a whole episode\ncalled \"Master Stress,\"\nor I think maybe it was\ncalled \"Conquer Stress\"\nand it was \"Master Stress,\" either one.\nThe whole point of that\nepisode is to give you tools\nand practices to deal with\nshort term, acute stress,\nmoderate term stress, and\nlong-term chronic stress\nthrough behavioral mechanisms,\nnutrition, supplementation,\nand many other things as well.\nIt's chockablock full of\nprotocols and tools for stress.\nThe vagus nerve, however,\nis responsible for emotion\nand the way it does that\nis to pool, to aggregate the conditions\nof your gut, the conditions of your heart\nand the conditions of your breathing,\nwhich includes your diaphragm\nand lungs and takes that kind\nof as a collection of\ninformation and sends it\nto the brain and controls\nwhat we call your emotions.\nNow that might seem\nobvious to some people,\nbut to other people that\nmight seem totally crazy.\nYou thought your emotions were\nbecause the market was down\nand you had invested,\nor because something that\nyou thought was going\nto happen is not going to happen,\nor because you thought\nthat school was open\nand then it's not, or\nmaybe thought it wasn't,\nand it is whatever it is that bothers you,\nyou think of generally as\na purely cognitive event.\nBut the brain doesn't really know\nwhat to do with that information.\nIt doesn't act directly on that\ninformation to create moods.\nMoods are created through\nthe heart's response\nto reading that headline, to\nthe change in your breathing,\nthat's caused by someone\nthat you love telling you\nthat actually they're not interested\nin spending time with you anymore,\nor that you screwed up or\nthat they're interested in\nspending a lot of time with\nyou and you like that, right?\nEmotions can be good or bad or neutral.\nSo this thing that we call interoception,\nthe sense of self I've been building up\nfrom very fundamental\nlayers, gut chemistry,\nspleens, immune systems,\nauto-immune and you might've been\nthinking, wait, I thought this was going\nto be about a sense of self,\na noticing or a feeling.\nAnd indeed all of those things\nare plugging in like a series\nof ingredients in a recipe that gives rise\nto your mood and how you feel,\nand that mood and how you feel is shown\nin one location in your body\nthat other people can see.\nAnd that's in your facial expressions.\nAnd indeed there are now\nbeautiful data showing\nthat your face, including\nthe size of your pupils,\nthe tonality of your\nface, how flushed you are,\nor how pale you are,\neven the degree to which you're frowning\nor smiling relative to\nother periods of time,\nthat is all an aggregate\nof, or a reflection rather\nof your gut, your heart and your breathing\nand the chemistry of your body.\nAnd so this is why I sort of\nbacked into this conversation\nabout interoception I kind\nof Trojan horse this on you\non purpose which is that\nwhen we talk about the\nvagus and you hear, oh,\nyou know, you can get vagal\ntone by breathing or rubbing\non the front of the or\nshort that's probably true,\nbut another fundamental layer\nis the acidity of your gut,\nhow fast your breathing\nare you inhale-emphasized,\nor exhale-emphasized breathing.\nWhen we are relaxed our\npupils tend to constrict.\nWhen we are very alert,\nour pupils tend to be\ndilated, whether or not\nthat alertness has to do with\nbeing happy or being sad.\nAnd what's remarkable, and\nthis is where interoception\nreally takes a leap into the incredible\nis that there are\nbeautiful studies that show\nthat for instance, when we\nknow somebody pretty well\nand they are going through\nsome sort of experience\nof any kind, our heart rate\nactually starts to mimic their heart rate.\nOur breathing starts to\nmimic their breathing,\neven if we aren't conscious\nof their breathing.\nIt's not like we see their chest heaving,\nand we think, oh my goodness,\nand then we breathe that way.\nThere's a mirroring\nand no it's not carried\nout through mirror neurons.\nMirror neurons are more\nof a myth and a reality,\nsorry to burst people's bubbles.\nBut that bubble around mirror\nneurons is definitely made of\nmyths and a topic for another\ntime, but we start to mirror.\nSomehow human beings are able\nto register the internal state\nof other beings, and I think\nprobably for animals too,\nbut certainly for other\nhumans, even at a distance.\nAnd these studies are many now,\nand they're really wonderful studies.\nAnd so your sense of\nyour internal landscape\nis linked to others.\nNow you can enhance this\ninteroceptive capacity\nfor how you feel and how\nothers feel, in other words,\nyou can start getting a better\nreadout of your internal\nstate by doing a simple\nexercise, what is really a tool.\nAnd that is to learn to\nsense your heartbeats.\nSo some people are very good\nat this, other people are not,\nsome people can do this more\neasily when they have all their\nair exhaled and some\npeople can do it better\nwhen they are holding a breath hold.\nBut one thing that's kind of cool\nabout this whole interoceptive capacity\nis that you can enhance it very quickly.\nYou can learn or teach yourself\nto have heightened levels\nof interoception in a way that\nyou can't really just give\nyourself heightened levels of vision\nby snapping your fingers, in\none of one tool or exercise,\nthere are things you can\ndo to improve vision.\nThat's the topic of a previous episode.\nI encourage you to look it up.\nThere are things you can\ndo to improve your hearing\nand your taste and your smell,\nwe talked about all those,\nbut with interoception you can get\nvery good at this very fast.\nAnd I think this is one\nof the reasons why meditation is powerful.\nThink there are a lot of reasons\nwhy meditation is powerful,\nbut one of the reasons\nis when you stop taking\nin exteroceptive information\nfrom the outside world,\nby closing your eyes and\nfocusing inward, as they say,\nyou start paying attention\nto your breathing cadence,\nyou start directing your mind's attention\nto your heart rate,\nand if you can start to\nperceive your heart beating.\nYou actually are very quickly strengthen\nthe vagal connections between\nthe body and the brain.\nAnd so there's no real practice here.\nThere's no breathe this\nway or do this thing\nexcept to direct your awareness\ntoward your heartbeat.\nAnd some people can get\nvery good at this very fast.\nMost people find that just by doing this\nfor a minute or so, every once in a while,\nthey start to tap into this sixth sense.\nThey start to notice when\nthey don't feel quite right\nabout something or\nsomebody or some situation,\nor they start to notice\nwhen they feel quite right\nabout somebody or something\nor some situation.\nSo this interoceptive\nawareness can be tuned up.\nIt used to be called vagal tone,\nbut I think that term doesn't\ntake into account all the\nother things that are\ngoing on with the vagus.\nSo I don't really like that term.\nIt's more of an interoceptive awareness.\nAnd again, there are\nmany studies now showing\nthat for sake of bettering\none's mood overall,\nfor sake of moving through\na challenging phase\nin life, for sake of just\nenhancing one's experience\nof life overall, whether or\nnot it's the taste of foods,\ninteractions with other people,\nenjoyment, focus, pleasure,\ntuning up one's interoceptive awareness\nis both easy again by just\ntaking a minute or two\nand trying to count heartbeats.\nAnd then this works best, of course,\nif you have some independent\nreadout of heartbeats and you\ncan compare, you can see\nhow accurate you are,\nbut even if you don't use\na device or have a device\nto do that, without taking your pulse,\nusing your thumb on your wrist\nor something, or your fingers\non your neck, as you typically\nwould for taking your pulse,\ntrying to sit still for a\nminute or two every once\nin a while, maybe once a\nweek, maybe twice a week,\nmaybe while you're meditating,\nmaybe while breathwork,\nmaybe during the breath\nholds of breathwork,\nyou don't really have to do this\nin any kind of extended way,\nyou can very quickly increase\nyour interoceptive tone.\nAnd that has a huge and outsized effect\non the brain, body relationship\nand your brain's ability to tap into\nboth the subconscious\nand the conscious aspects\nof this chemical and mechanical signaling\nthat's happening all the time.\nAnd it can have real and\nout-sized positive effects\non your ability to engage\nwith other people and your\nability to focus at work\nand your ability to notice, ah,\nI'm finding myself kind of\nfeeling like I'm losing focus,\nbut really it was my heart\nrate was just increasing.\nMaybe I just exhale a little bit\nand bring my heart rate down.\nSo whatever effectually tried to do today\nis to give you a window into\nthis incredible relationship\nbetween your viscera and\nyour brain and your brain\nand your viscera, all\nthese organs of your body,\nand what I hope is that you'll appreciate\nthat it's a system, that you\naren't just a system of tubes.\nI said that in a sort of in jest, I mean,\nyou have a lot of tubes and\nyou are a system of tubes,\nbut that system of tubes is\nlinked through the nervous\nsystem, and those links\nwork in very specific ways.\nSo whether or not you remember\nabout pesos and all the GLPRs\nand all that stuff, it\ndoesn't really matter.\nWhat I encourage you to do\nis start sort of pushing and\npulling on the various leavers\nwithin this beautiful system\nthat we call the interoceptive\nsystem, this sense of self.\nIf you're learning from this\npodcast and or if you're\nenjoying it, please subscribe\nto our YouTube channel.\nThat really helps
