    "transcript": "[bright music]\n- Welcome to the \"Huberman Lab Podcast,\"\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday I have the pleasure of\nintroducing Dr. Lex Fridman\nas our guest on the\n\"Huberman Lab Podcast.\"\nDr. Fridman is a researcher\nat MIT specializing\nin machine learning,\nartificial intelligence and\nhuman robot interactions.\nI must say that the conversation with Lex\nwas without question,\none of the most fascinating conversations\nthat I've ever had,\nnot just in my career, but in my lifetime.\nI knew that Lex worked on these topics.\nAnd I think many of you are\nprobably familiar with Lex\nand his interest in these topics\nfrom his incredible podcast,\nthe \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\"\nIf you're not already\nwatching that podcast,\nplease subscribe to it.\nIt is absolutely fantastic.\nBut in holding this conversation with Lex,\nI realized something far more important.\nHe revealed to us a bit of his dream.\nHis dream about humans and robots,\nabout humans and machines,\nand about how those interactions\ncan change the way that\nwe perceive ourselves\nand that we interact with the world.\nWe discuss relationships of all kinds,\nrelationships with animals,\nrelationships with friends,\nrelationships with family\nand romantic relationships.\nAnd we discuss relationships\nwith the machines.\nMachines that move and\nmachines that don't move,\nand machines that come\nto understand us in ways\nthat we could never\nunderstand for ourselves,\nand how those machines can\neducate us about ourselves.\nBefore this conversation,\nI had no concept of the ways\nin which machines could inform me\nor anyone about themselves.\nBy the end,\nI was absolutely taken with the idea,\nand I'm still taken with the idea\nthat interactions with machines\nhave a very particular kind,\na kind that Lex understands and\nwants to bring to the world,\ncan not only transform the self,\nbut may very well transform humanity.\nSo whether or not you're familiar\nwith Dr. Lex Fridman or not,\nI'm certain you're going to learn\na tremendous amount from him\nduring the course of our discussion,\nand that it will transform\nthe way that you think about\nyourself and about the world.\nBefore we begin,\nI want to mention that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however part of my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses\nthat are of absolutely phenomenal quality.\nThe company was founded\nby two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\nand everything about the sunglasses\nand eyeglasses they've designed\nhad performance in mind.\nI've spent a career working\non the visual system.\nAnd one of the fundamental issues\nthat your visual system has to deal with\nis how to adjust what you see\nwhen it gets darker or\nbrighter in your environment.\nWith ROKA Sunglasses and Eyeglasses,\nwhether or not it's dim\nin the room or outside,\nor not there's cloud cover,\nor whether or not you walk into a shadow,\nyou can always see the\nworld with absolute clarity.\nAnd that just tells me\nthat they really understand\nthe way that the visual system works.\nProcesses like habituation\nand attenuation.\nAll these things that work\nat a real mechanistic level\nhave been built into these glasses.\nIn addition, the glasses\nare very lightweight.\nYou don't even notice really\nthat they're on your face.\nAnd the quality of the lenses is terrific.\nNow, the glasses were also designed\nso that you could use them,\nnot just while working\nor at dinner, et cetera,\nbut while exercising.\nThey don't fall off your\nface or slip off your face\nif you're sweating.\nAnd as I mentioned,\nthey're extremely lightweight.\nSo you can use them while running,\nyou can use them while\ncycling and so forth.\nAlso the aesthetic of\nROKA glasses is terrific.\nUnlike a lot of performance\nglasses out there,\nwhich frankly make\npeople look like cyborgs,\nthese glasses look great.\nYou can wear them out to dinner,\nyou can wear them for\nessentially any occasion.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to roka.com.\nThat's R-O-K-A .com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's ROKA,\nR-O-K-A .com and enter the\ncode Huberman at checkout.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be assessed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof quality DNA tests,\nwe can also get insight\ninto some of our genetic underpinnings\nof our current and long-term health.\nThe problem with a lot of blood\nand DNA tests out there, however,\nis you get the data back and\nyou don't know what to do\nwith those data.\nYou see that certain things are high\nor certain things are low,\nbut you really don't know\nwhat the actionable items are,\nwhat to do with all that information.\nWith InsideTracker,\nthey make it very easy to\nact in the appropriate ways\non the information that you get back\nfrom those blood and DNA tests.\nAnd that's through the use\nof their online platform.\nThey have a really easy to use dashboard\nthat tells you what sorts of\nthings can bring the numbers\nfor your metabolic factors,\nendocrine factors, et cetera,\ninto the ranges that you want and need\nfor immediate and long-term health.\nIn fact, I know one individual\njust by way of example,\nthat was feeling good,\nbut decided to go with\nan InsideTracker test\nand discovered that they had high levels\nof what's called C-reactive protein.\nThey would have never\ndetected that otherwise.\nC-reactive protein is associated\nwith a number of deleterious\nhealth conditions,\nsome heart issues, eye issues, et cetera.\nAnd so they were able\nto take immediate action\nto try and resolve those CRP levels.\nAnd so with InsideTracker,\nyou get that sort of insight.\nAnd as I mentioned before,\nwithout a blood or DNA test,\nthere's no way you're going\nto get that sort of insight\nuntil symptoms start to show up.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nYou just use the code\nHuberman at checkout.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nToday's podcast is brought\nto us by Athletic Greens.\nAthletic Greens is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic drink.\nI started taking Athletic\nGreens way back in 2012.\nAnd so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nThe reason I started\ntaking Athletic Greens\nand the reason I still\ntake Athletic Greens\nis that it covers all of my\nvitamin mineral probiotic basis.\nIn fact, when people ask\nme, what should I take?\nI always suggest that the\nfirst supplement people take\nis Athletic Greens,\nfor the simple reason,\nis that the things that\ncontains covers your bases\nfor metabolic health, endocrine health,\nand all sorts of other\nsystems in the body.\nAnd the inclusion of probiotics\nare essential for a\nhealthy gut microbiome.\nThere are now tons of data showing\nthat we have neurons in our gut,\nand keeping those neurons healthy requires\nthat they are exposed\nto what are called the correct microbiota,\nlittle microorganisms that live in our gut\nand keep us healthy.\nAnd those neurons in turn\nhelp keep our brain healthy.\nThey influence things like\nmood, our ability to focus,\nand many, many other\nfactors related to health.\nWith Athletic Greens, it's terrific,\nbecause it also tastes really good.\nI drink it once or twice a day.\nI mix mine with water and\nI add a little lemon juice,\nor sometimes a little bit of lime juice.\nIf you want to try athletic greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you can\nclaim their special offer.\nThey're giving away\nfive free travel packs,\nlittle packs that make it\neasy to mix up Athletic Greens\nwhile you're on the road.\nAnd they'll give you a year supply\nof vitamin D3 and K2.\nAgain, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nto claim that special offer.\nAnd now, my conversation\nwith Dr. Lex Fridman.\n- We meet again.\n- We meet again.\nThanks so much for sitting down with me.\nI have a question that I think\nis on a lot of people's minds\nor ought to be on a lot of people's minds,\nbecause we hear these\nterms a lot these days,\nbut I think most people,\nincluding most scientists and including me\ndon't know really what is\nartificial intelligence,\nand how is it different\nfrom things like machine\nlearning and robotics?\nSo, if you would be so\nkind as to explain to us,\nwhat is artificial intelligence,\nand what is machine learning?\n- Well, I think that\nquestion is as complicated\nand as fascinating as the\nquestion of, what is intelligence?\nSo, I think of artificial intelligence,\nfirst, as a big philosophical thing.\nPamela McCormick said\nAI was the ancient wish\nto forge the gods,\nor was born as an ancient\nwish to forge the gods.\nSo I think at the big philosophical level,\nit's our longing to create\nother intelligence systems.\nPerhaps systems more powerful than us.\nAt the more narrow level,\nI think it's also set of tools\nthat are computational mathematical tools\nto automate different tasks.\nAnd then also it's our attempt\nto understand our own mind.\nSo, build systems that exhibit\nsome intelligent behavior\nin order to understand\nwhat is intelligence\nin our own selves.\nSo all of those things are true.\nOf course, what AI really\nmeans as a community,\nas a set of researchers and engineers,\nit's a set of tools,\na set of computational techniques\nthat allow you to solve various problems.\nThere's a long history\nthat approaches the problem\nfrom different perspectives.\nWhat's always been throughout\none of the threads,\none of the communities goes under the flag\nof machine learning,\nwhich is emphasizing in the AI space,\nthe task of learning.\nHow do you make a machine\nthat knows very little in the beginning,\nfollow some kind of process\nand learns to become better and\nbetter at a particular task?\nWhat's been most very effective\nin the recent about 15 years\nis a set of techniques\nthat fall under the flag\nof deep learning that\nutilize neural networks.\nWhen your networks are these\nfascinating things inspired\nby the structure of the human brain,\nvery loosely, but they have a,\nit's a network of these little\nbasic computational units\ncalled neurons, artificial neurons.\nAnd they have,\nthese architectures have\nan input and output.\nThey know nothing in the beginning,\nand their task with learning\nsomething interesting.\nWhat that's something interesting is,\nusually involves a particular task.\nThere's a lot of ways to talk about this\nand break this down.\nLike one of them is how\nmuch human supervision\nis required to teach this thing.\nSo supervised learning is broad category,\nis the neural network knows\nnothing in the beginning\nand then it's given a bunch\nof examples in computer vision\nthat will be examples of cats,\ndogs, cars, traffic signs,\nand then you're given the image\nand you're given the ground\ntruth of what's in that image.\nAnd when you get a large\ndatabase of such image examples\nwhere you know the truth,\nthe neural network is\nable to learn by example,\nthat's called supervised learning.\nThere's a lot of fascinating\nquestions within that,\nwhich is, how do you provide the truth?\nWhen you given an image of a cat,\nhow do you provide to the computer\nthat this image contains a cat?\nDo you just say the entire\nimage is a picture of a cat?\nDo you do what's very commonly been done,\nwhich is a bounding box,\nyou have a very crude box\naround the cat's face saying,\nthis is a cat?\nDo you do semantic segmentation?\nMind you, this is a 2D image of a cat.\nSo it's not,\nthe computer knows nothing\nabout our three-dimensional world,\nis just looking at a set of pixels.\nSo, semantic segmentation\nis drawing a nice,\nvery crisp outline around the\ncat and saying, that's a cat.\nThat's really difficult\nto provide that truth.\nAnd one of the fundamental open questions\nin computer vision is,\nis that even a good\nrepresentation of the truth?\nNow, there's another\ncontrasting set of ideas\nthat our attention they're overlapping is,\nwell, it's used to be called\nunsupervised learning.\nWhat's commonly now called\nself-supervised learning.\nWhich is trying to get less and less\nand less human supervision into the task.\nSo self-supervised learning is more,\nit's been very successful in\nthe domain of language model,\nnatural English processing,\nand now more and more as being successful\nin computer vision task.\nAnd the idea there is,\nlet the machine without\nany ground-truth annotation\njust look at pictures on the internet,\nor look at texts on the internet\nand try to learn something generalizable\nabout the ideas that are\nat the core of language\nor at the core of vision.\nAnd based on that,\nwe humans at its best like\nto call that common sense.\nSo with this,\nwe have this giant base of knowledge\non top of which we build\nmore sophisticated knowledge.\nWe have this kind of\ncommonsense knowledge.\nAnd so the idea with\nself-supervised learning\nis to build this\ncommonsense knowledge about,\nwhat are the fundamental visual ideas\nthat make up a cat and a dog\nand all those kinds of things\nwithout ever having human supervision?\nThe dream there is the,\nyou just let an AI system\nthat's self supervised\nrun around the internet for awhile,\nwatch YouTube videos for\nmillions and millions of hours,\nand without any supervision be primed\nand ready to actually learn\nwith very few examples\nonce the human is able to show up.\nWe think of children in this way,\nhuman children,\nis your parents only\ngive one or two examples\nto teach a concept.\nThe dream with self-supervised learning\nis that will be the same with machines.\nThat they would watch millions\nof hours of YouTube videos,\nand then come to a human\nand be able to understand\nwhen the human shows them, this is a cat.\nLike, remember this' a cat.\nThey will understand that a cat\nis not just the thing with pointy ears,\nor a cat is a thing that's\norange, or is furry,\nthey'll see something more fundamental\nthat we humans might not actually be able\nto introspect and understand.\nLike, if I asked you,\nwhat makes a cat versus a dog,\nyou wouldn't probably not\nbe able to answer that,\nbut if I showed you, brought\nto you a cat and a dog,\nyou'll be able to tell the difference.\nWhat are the ideas that your brain uses\nto make that difference?\nThat's the whole dream with\nself-supervised learning,\nis it would be able to\nlearn that on its own.\nThat set of commonsense knowledge,\nthat's able to tell the difference.\nAnd then there's like a\nlot of incredible uses\nof self-supervised learning,\nvery weirdly called self-play mechanism.\nThat's the mechanism behind\nthe reinforcement learning successes\nof the systems that won at Go,\nat, AlphaZero that won a chess.\n- Oh, I see.\nThat play games?\n- [Lex] That play games.\n- Got it.\n- So the idea of self-play is probably,\napplies to other domains than just games.\nIs a system that just\nplays against itself.\nAnd this is fascinating\nin all kinds of domains,\nbut it knows nothing in the beginning.\nAnd the whole idea is it creates\na bunch of mutations of itself\nand plays against those\nversions of itself.\nAnd the fascinating thing is\nwhen you play against systems\nthat are a little bit better than you,\nyou start to get better yourself.\nLike learning,\nthat's how learning happens.\nThat's true for martial arts.\nIt's true in a lot of cases.\nWhere you want to be\ninteracting with systems\nthat are just a little better than you.\nAnd then through this process\nof interacting with systems\njust a little better than you,\nyou start following this process\nwhere everybody starts getting\nbetter and better and better\nand better until you are\nseveral orders of magnitude\nbetter than the world champion\nin chess, for example.\nAnd it's fascinating because\nit's like a runaway system.\nOne of the most terrifying\nand exciting things\nthat David Silver, the creator\nof AlphaGo and AlphaZero,\none of the leaders of the team said,\nto me is a,\nthey haven't found the\nceiling for AlphaZero.\nMeaning it could just\narbitrarily keep improving.\nNow, in the realm of chess,\nthat doesn't matter to us.\nThat it's like,\nit just ran away with the game of chess.\nLike it's like just so\nmuch better than humans.\nBut the question is what,\nif you can create that in the\nrealm that does have a bigger,\ndeeper effect on human\nbeings and societies,\nthat can be a terrifying process.\nTo me, it's an exciting process\nif you supervise it correctly,\nif you inject, if what's\ncalled value alignment,\nyou make sure that the goals\nthat the AI is optimizing\nis aligned with human\nbeings and human societies.\nThere's a lot of fascinating\nthings to talk about\nwithin the specifics of neural networks\nand all the problems that\npeople are working on.\nBut I would say the really big,\nexciting one is self-supervised learning.\nWe're trying to get less\nand less human supervision,\nless and less human\nsupervision of neural networks.\nAnd also just a comment and I'll shut up.\n- No, please keep going.\nI'm learning.\nI have questions, but I'm learning.\nSo please keep going.\n- So, to me what's\nexciting is not the theory,\nit's always the application.\nOne of the most exciting applications\nof artificial intelligence,\nspecifically neural networks\nand machine learning\nis Tesla Autopilot.\nSo these are systems that are\nworking in the real world.\nThis isn't an academic exercise.\nThis is human lives at stake.\nThis is safety-critical.\n- These are automated vehicles.\nAutonomous vehicles.\n- Semi-autonomous.\nWe want to be.\n- Okay.\n- We've gone through wars on these topics,\n- Semi-autonomous vehicles.\n- Semi-autonomous.\nSo, even though it's called\na FSD, Full Self-Driving,\nit is currently not fully autonomous,\nmeaning human supervision is required.\nSo, human is tasked with\noverseeing the systems.\nIn fact, liability-wise, the\nhuman is always responsible.\nThis is a human factor\npsychology question,\nwhich is fascinating.\nI'm fascinated by the whole space,\nwhich is a whole 'nother space\nof human robot interaction\nwhen AI systems and humans work together\nto accomplish tasks.\nThat dance to me is one of\nthe smaller communities,\nbut I think it will be one of the most\nimportant open problems\nonce they're solved,\nis how the humans and\nrobots dance together.\nTo me, semi-autonomous driving\nis one of those spaces.\nSo for Elon, for example,\nhe doesn't see it that way,\nhe sees semi-autonomous\ndriving as a stepping stone\ntowards fully autonomous driving.\nLike, humans and robots\ncan't dance well together.\nLike, humans and humans dance\nand robots and robots dance.\nLike, we need to,\nthis is an engineering problem,\nwe need to design a perfect\nrobot that solves this problem.\nTo me forever,\nmaybe this is not the case with driving,\nbut the world is going\nto be full of problems\nwith always humans and\nrobots have to interact,\nbecause I think robots\nwill always be flawed,\njust like humans are going\nto be flawed, are flawed.\nAnd that's what makes life beautiful,\nthat they're flawed.\nThat's where learning happens\nat the edge of your capabilities.\nSo you always have to figure out,\nhow can flawed robots and\nflawed humans interact together\nsuch that they, like the sum\nis bigger than the whole,\nas opposed to focusing on just\nbuilding the perfect robot?\n- Mm-hmm.\n- So that's one of the\nmost exciting applications\nI would say of artificial\nintelligence to me\nis autonomous driving, the\nsemi-autonomous driving.\nAnd that's a really good\nexample of machine learning\nbecause those systems\nare constantly learning.\nAnd there's a process there\nthat maybe I can comment on,\nthe, Andrej Karpathy who's\nthe head of autopilot\ncalls it the data engine.\nAnd this process applies for\na lot of machine learning,\nwhich is you build a\nsystem that's pretty good\nat doing stuff,\nyou send it out into the real world,\nit starts doing the stuff\nand then it runs into what\nare called edge cases,\nlike failure cases,\nwhere it screws up.\nWe do this as kids.\nThat you have-\n- You do this as adults.\n- We do this as adults.\nExactly.\nBut we learn really quickly.\nBut the whole point,\nand this is the fascinating\nthing about driving,\nis you realize there's\nmillions of edge cases.\nThere's just like weird situations\nthat you did not expect.\nAnd so the data engine process\nis you collect those edge cases,\nand then you go back to the drawing board\nand learn from them.\nAnd so you have to\ncreate this data pipeline\nwhere all these cars,\nhundreds of thousands of\ncars are driving around\nand something weird happens.\nAnd so whenever this weird detector fires,\nit's another important concept,\nthat piece of data goes\nback to the mothership\nfor the training,\nfor the retraining of the system.\nAnd through this data engine process,\nit keeps improving and\ngetting better and better\nand better and better.\nSo basically you send out\na pretty clever AI\nsystems out into the world\nand let it find the edge cases,\nlet it screw up just enough to figure out\nwhere the edge cases are,\nand then go back and learn from them,\nand then send out that new version\nand keep updating that version.\n- Is the updating done by humans?\n- The annotation is done by humans.\nThe, so you have to,\nthe weird examples come back,\nthe edge cases,\nand you have to label what\nactually happened in there.\nThere's also some mechanisms\nfor automatically labeling,\nbut mostly,\nI think you always have to\nrely on humans to improve,\nto understand what's\nhappening in the weird cases.\nAnd then there's a lot of debate.\nAnd this, the other thing,\nwhat is artificial intelligence?\nWhich is a bunch of smart people\nhaving very different opinions\nabout what is intelligence.\nSo AI is basically a community of people\nwho don't agree on anything.\n- And it seems to be the case.\nFirst of all,\nthis is a beautiful description of terms\nthat I've heard many times\namong my colleagues at Stanford,\nat meetings in the outside world.\nAnd there are so many fascinating things.\nI have so many questions,\nbut I do want to ask one\nquestion about the culture of AI,\nbecause it does seem to be a community\nwhere at least as an outsider,\nwhere it seems like there's\nvery little consensus\nabout what the terms\nand the operational definitions even mean.\nAnd there seems to be a lot\nof splitting happening now\nof not just supervised\nand unsupervised learning,\nbut these sort of intermediate conditions\nwhere machines are autonomous,\nbut then go back for more instruction\nlike kids go home from\ncollege during the summer\nand get a little,\nmoms still feeds them\nthen eventually they leave\nthe nest kind of thing.\nIs there something in\nparticular about engineers,\nor about people in this\nrealm of engineering\nthat you think lends\nitself to disagreement?\n- Yeah, I think,\nso, first of all, the\nmore specific you get,\nthe less disagreement there is.\nSo there's lot of disagreement\nabout what is artificial intelligence,\nbut there's less disagreement\nabout what is machine learning\nand even less when you\ntalk about active learning\nor machine teaching or\nself-supervised learning.\nAnd then when you get\ninto like NLP language\nmodels or transformers,\nwhen you get into specific\nneural network architectures,\nthere's less and less\nand less disagreement\nabout those terms.\nSo you might be hearing the disagreement\nfrom the high-level terms,\nand that has to do with\nthe fact that engineering,\nespecially when you're talking\nabout intelligence systems\nis a little bit of an art and a science.\nSo the art part is the thing\nthat creates disagreements,\nbecause then you start\nhaving disagreements\nabout how easy or difficult\nthe particular problem is.\nFor example,\na lot of people disagree with Elon\nhow difficult the problem\nof autonomous driving is.\nAnd so, but nobody knows.\nSo there's a lot of disagreement about,\nwhat are the limits of these techniques?\nAnd through that,\nthe terminology also contains\nwithin it the disagreements.\nBut overall,\nI think it's also a young science\nthat also has to do with that.\nSo like it's not just engineering,\nit's that artificial intelligence truly\nis a large-scale discipline,\nwhere it's thousands, tens of thousands,\nhundreds of thousands\nof people working on it,\nhuge amounts of money being\nmade as a very recent thing.\nSo we're trying to figure out those terms.\nAnd, of course,\nthere's egos and personalities\nand a lot of fame to be made.\nLike the term deep learning, for example,\nneural networks have been around\nfor many, many decades since the '60s,\nyou can argue since the '40s.\nSo there was a rebranding\nof neural networks\ninto the word, deep learning,\nterm, deep learning,\nthat was part of the\nre-invigoration of the field,\nbut it's really the same exact thing.\n- I didn't know that.\nI mean, I grew up in\nthe age of neuroscience\nwhen neural networks were discussed,\ncomputational neuroscience\nand theoretical neuroscience,\nthey had their own journals.\nIt wasn't actually\ntaken terribly seriously\nby experimentalists until a few years ago.\nI would say about five to seven years ago.\nExcellent theoretical\nneuroscientist like Larry Abbott\nand other colleagues,\ncertainly at Stanford as well\nthat people started paying attention\nto computational methods.\nBut these terms,\nneural networks, computational methods,\nI actually didn't know\nthat neural network works\nin deep learning where\nthose have now become\nkind of synonymous.\n- No, they're always the same thing.\n- Interesting.\nIt was, so.\n- I'm a neuroscientist\nand I didn't know that.\n- So, well, because neural networks\nprobably means something else\nand neural science not something else,\nbut a little different flavor\ndepending on the field.\nAnd that's fascinating too,\nbecause neuroscience and AI people\nhave started working together\nand dancing a lot more\nin the recent,\nI would say probably decade.\n- Oh, machines are going into the brain.\nI have a couple of questions,\nbut one thing that I'm sort of fixated on\nthat I find incredibly interesting\nis this example you gave of playing a game\nwith a mutated version of\nyourself as a competitor.\n- Yeah.\n- I find that incredibly interesting\nas a kind of a parallel or a mirror\nfor what happens when we\ntry and learn as humans,\nwhich is we generate repetitions\nof whatever it is we're trying to learn,\nand we make errors.\nOccasionally we succeed.\nIn a simple example, for instance,\nof trying to throw bulls\neyes on a dartboard.\n- Yeah.\n- I'm going to have\nerrors, errors, errors.\nI'll probably miss the dartboard.\nAnd maybe occasionally, hit a bullseye.\nAnd I don't know exactly\nwhat I just did, right?\nBut then let's say I was playing darts\nagainst a version of myself\nwhere I was wearing a visual prism,\nlike my visual, I had a visual defect,\nyou learn certain things\nin that mode as well.\nYou're saying that a machine\ncan sort of mutate itself,\ndoes the mutation always\ncause a deficiency\nthat it needs to overcome?\nBecause of mutations in biology\nsometimes give us super powers, right?\nOccasionally, you'll get somebody\nwho has better than 2020 vision,\nand they can see better than\n99.9% of people out there.\nSo, when you talk about\na machine playing a game\nagainst a mutated version of itself,\nis the mutation always say what\nwe call a negative mutation,\nor an adaptive or a maladaptive mutation?\n- No, you don't know until you get,\nso, you mutate first\nand then figure out and they\ncompete against each other.\n- So, you're evolving,\nthe machine gets to evolve\nitself in real time.\n- Yeah.\nAnd I think of it,\nwhich would be exciting\nif you could actually do with humans.\nIt's not just.\nSo, usually you freeze\na version of the system.\nSo, really you take on Andrew of yesterday\nand you make 10 clones of them.\nAnd then maybe you mutate, maybe not.\nAnd then you do a bunch of competitions\nof the Andrew of today,\nlike you fight to the death,\nand who wins last.\nSo, I love that idea\nof like creating a bunch\nof clones of myself\nfrom like from each of\nthe day for the past year,\nand just seeing who's going to be better\nat like podcasting or science,\nor picking up chicks at\na bar or I don't know,\nor competing in Jujitsu.\nThat's the one way to do it,\nI mean, a lot of Lexes would\nhave to die for that process,\nbut that's essentially what happens,\nis in reinforcement learning\nthrough the self-play mechanisms,\nit's a graveyard of systems\nthat didn't do that well.\nAnd the surviving, the good ones survive.\n- Do you think that, I mean,\nDarwin's Theory of Evolution\nmight have worked in\nsome sense in this way,\nbut at the population level.\nI mean, you get a bunch of birds\nwith different shaped beaks\nand some birds have the shaped beak\nthat allows them to get the seeds.\nI mean, is a trivially simple example\nof Darwinian in evolution,\nbut I think it's correct even\nthough it's not exhaustive.\nIs what you're referring to?\nYou essentially that normally this is done\nbetween members of a different species,\nlots of different members of\nspecies have different traits\nand some get selected for,\nbut you could actually create\nmultiple versions of yourself\nwith different traits.\n- So, with, I should\nprobably have said this,\nbut perhaps it's implied\nwith machine learning,\nwith reinforcement learning\nthrough these processes.\nOne of the big requirements,\nis to have an objective\nfunction, a loss function,\na utility function,\nthose are all different\nterms for the same thing,\nis there's a like any equation\nthat says what's good,\nand then you're trying to\noptimize that equation.\nSo, there's a clear\ngoal for these systems.\n- Because it's a game, like\nwith chess, there's a goal.\n- But for anything.\nAnything you want machine\nlearning to solve,\nthere needs to be an objective function.\nIn machine learning, it's\nusually called Loss Function,\nthat you're optimizing.\nThe interesting thing about evolution,\nit's complicated of course,\nbut the goal also seems to be evolving.\nLike it's a, I guess,\nadaptation to the environment,\nis the goal,\nbut it's unclear that you\ncan convert that always.\nIt's like survival of the fittest.\nIt's unclear what the fittest is.\nIn machine learning,\nthe starting point,\nand this is like what\nhuman ingenuity provides,\nis that fitness function of\nwhat's good and what's bad,\nwhich it lets you know which\nof the systems is going to win.\nSo, you need to have a equation like that.\nOne of the fascinating\nthings about humans,\nis we figure out objective\nfunctions for ourselves.\nLike it's the meaning of life,\nlike why the hell are we here?\nAnd a machine currently\nhas to have a hard-coded\nstatement about why.\n- It has to have a meaning of-\n- Yeah.\n- Artificial intelligence-based life.\n- Right.\nIt can't.\nSo, like there's a lot of\ninteresting explorations\nabout that function being\nmore about curiosity,\nabout learning new things\nand all that kind of stuff,\nbut it's still hard coded.\nIf you want a machine to be\nable to be good at stuff,\nit has to be given very clear statements\nof what good at stuff means.\nThat's one of the challenges\nof artificial intelligence,\nis you have to formalize the,\nin order to solve a problem,\nyou have to formalize it\nand you have to provide\nboth like the full sensory information,\nyou have to be very clear\nabout what is the data\nthat's being collected,\nand you have to also be clear\nabout the objective function.\nWhat is the goal that\nyou're trying to reach?\nAnd that's a very difficult thing\nfor artificial intelligence.\n- I love that you mentioned curiosity,\nI am sure this definition\nfalls short in many ways,\nbut I define curiosity\nas a strong interest in knowing something,\nbut without an attachment to the outcome.\nIt's sort of a, it could\nbe a random search,\nbut there's not really\nan emotional attachment,\nit's really just a desire\nto discover and unveil what's there\nwithout hoping it's a\ngold coin under a rock,\nyou're just looking under rocks.\nIs that more or less how the,\nwithin machine learning,\nit sounds like there are elements\nof reward prediction and rewards.\nThe machine has to know when\nit's done the right thing.\nSo, can you make machines\nthat are curious,\nor are the sorts of machines\nthat you are describing,\ncurious by design?\n- Yeah, curiosity is a kind\nof a symptom, not the goal.\nSo, what happens,\nis one of the big trade-offs\nin reinforcement learning,\nis this exploration versus exploitation.\nSo, when you know very little,\nit pays off to explore a lot,\neven suboptimal, like even trajectories\nthat seem like they're not\ngoing to lead anywhere,\nthat's called exploration.\nThe smarter and smarter\nand smarter you get,\nthe more emphasis you put on exploitation,\nmeaning you take the best\nsolution, you take the best path.\nNow, through that process,\nthe exploration can look\nlike curiosity by us humans,\nbut it's really just trying to\nget out of the local optimal,\nthe thing it's already discovered.\nFrom an AI perspective,\nit's always looking to optimize\nthe objective function,\nit derives, and we can\ntalk about the slot more,\nbut in terms of the tools\nof machine learning today,\nit derives no pleasure\nfrom just the curiosity\nof like, I don't know, discovery.\n- So, there's no dopamine\nfor machine learning.\n- There's no dopamine.\n- There's no reward, system chemical,\nor I guess electronic-reward system.\n- That said, if you look at\nmachine learning literature\nand reinforcement learning literature,\nthat will use,\nlike deep mind, we use\nterms like dopamine,\nwe're constantly trying\nto use the human brain\nto inspire totally new\nsolutions to these problems.\nSo, they'll think like,\nhow does dopamine function\nin the human brain,\nand how can it lead to\nmore interesting ways\nto discover optimal solutions?\nBut ultimately currently,\nthere has to be a formal\nobjective function.\nNow, you could argue\nthe humans also has a set\nof objective functions\nwe try and optimize, we're just\nnot able to introspect them.\n- Yeah, we don't actually\nknow what we're looking for\nand seeking and doing.\n- Well, like Lisa Feldman Barrett\nwho we spoken with at least\non Instagram, I hope you-\n- I met her through you, yeah.\n- Yeah, I hope you actually\nhave are on this podcast.\n- Yes, she's terrific.\n- So, she has a very,\nit has to do with homeostasis like that.\nBasically, there's a very\ndumb objective function\nthat the brain is trying to optimize,\nlike to keep like body\ntemperature the same.\nLike there's a very dom\nkind of optimization function happening.\nAnd then what we humans do\nwith our fancy consciousness\nand cognitive abilities, is\nwe tell stories to ourselves\nso we can have nice podcasts,\nbut really it's the brain\ntrying to maintain a,\njust like healthy state, I guess.\nThat's fascinating.\nI also see the human brain,\nand I hope artificial\nintelligence systems,\nas not just systems that solve\nproblems, or optimize a goal,\nbut are also storytellers.\nI think there's a power\nto telling stories.\nWe tell stories to each other,\nthat's what communication is.\nLike when you're alone, that's\nwhen you solve problems,\nthat's when it makes sense to\ntalk about solving problems.\nBut when you're a community,\nthe capability to\ncommunicate, tell stories,\nshare ideas in such a way\nthat those ideas are stable\nover a long period of time,\nthat's like, that's being\na charismatic storyteller.\nAnd I think both humans\nare very good at this.\nArguably, I would argue\nthat's why we are who we are,\nis we're great storytellers.\nAnd then AI I hope will also become that.\nSo, it's not just about\nbeing able to solve problems\nwith a clear objective function,\nit's afterwards, be able\nto tell like a way better,\nlike make up a way better story\nabout why you did something,\nor why you failed.\n- So, you think that robots or,\nand/or machines of some sort\nare going to start telling human stories?\n- Well, definitely.\nSo, the technical field for\nthat is called Explainable AI,\nExplainable Artificial Intelligence,\nis trying to figure out\nhow you get the AI system\nto explain to us humans\nwhy the hell it failed,\nor why it succeeded,\nor there's a lot of different\nsort of versions of this,\nor to visualize how it\nunderstands the world.\nThat's a really difficult problem,\nespecially with neural networks\nthat are famously opaque,\nthat we don't understand in many cases,\nwhy a particular neural network\ndoes what it does so well,\nand to try to figure out\nwhere it's going to fail,\nthat requires the AI to explain itself.\nThere's a huge amount of money,\nlike there's a huge\namount of money in this,\nespecially from government\nfunding and so on.\nBecause if you want to deploy\nAI systems in the real world,\nwe humans at least, want\nto ask it a question like,\nwhy the hell did you do that?\nLike in a dark way,\nwhy did you just kill that person, right?\nLike if a car ran over a person,\nwe want to understand why that happened.\nAnd now again, we're sometimes\nvery unfair to AI systems\nbecause we humans can often\nnot explain why very well.\nBut that's the field of Explainable AI\nthat people are very interested in\nbecause the more and more\nwe rely on AI systems,\nlike the Twitter recommender system,\nthat AI algorithm that's, I\nwould say impacting elections,\nperhaps starting wars, or\nat least military conflict,\nthat algorithm, we want\nto ask that algorithm,\nfirst of all, do you know\nwhat the hell you're doing?\nDo you understand the society-level\neffects you're having?\nAnd can you explain the\npossible other trajectories?\nLike we would have that kind\nof conversation with a human,\nwe want to be able to do that with an AI.\nAnd in my own personal level,\nI think it would be nice\nto talk to AI systems\nfor stupid stuff, like\nrobots when they fail to-\n- Why'd you fall down the stairs?\n- Yeah.\nBut not an engineering question,\nbut almost like an endearing question,\nlike I'm looking for,\nif I fell and you and I were hanging out,\nI don't think you need an explanation\nexactly what were the dynamics,\nlike what was the under\nactuated system problem here?\nLike what was the texture of the floor?\nOr so on.\nOr like, what was the-\n- No, I want to know what you're thinking.\n- That, or you might joke about like,\nyou're drunk again, go home, or something,\nlike there could be humor in\nit, that's an opportunity.\nLike storytelling, isn't just\nexplanation of what happened,\nit's something that makes people laugh,\nit makes people fall in\nlove, it makes people dream,\nand understand things\nin a way that poetry makes\npeople understand things\nas opposed to a rigorous log\nof where every sensor was,\nwhere every actuator was.\n- I mean, I find this incredible\nbecause one of the hallmarks\nof severe autism spectrum disorders is,\na report of experience\nfrom the autistic person\nthat is very much a\ncatalog of action steps.\nIt's like, how do you feel today?\nAnd they'll say, well,\nI got up and I did this,\nand then I did this, and I did this.\nAnd it's not at all the way that a person\nwho doesn't have autism\nspectrum disorder would respond.\nAnd the way you describe these machines\nhas so much humanism,\nor so much of a human\nand biological element,\nbut I realized that we were\ntalking about machines.\nI want to make sure that I understand\nif there's a distinction\nbetween a machine that learns,\na machine with artificial\nintelligence and a robot.\nLike at what point does\na machine become a robot?\nSo, if I have a ballpoint pen,\nI'm assuming I wouldn't call that a robot,\nbut if my ballpoint pen can come to me\nwhen I moved to the\nopposite side of the table,\nif it moves by whatever mechanism,\nat that point, does it become a robot?\n- Okay, there's 1 million\nways to explore this question.\nIt's a fascinating one.\nSo, first of all, there's\na question of what is life?\nLike how do you know something\nas a living form and not?\nAnd it's to the question\nof when does sort of a,\nmaybe a cold computational\nsystem becomes a,\nor already loading these\nwords with a lot of meaning,\nrobot and machine,\nSo, one, I think movement is important,\nbut that's a kind of a boring idea\nthat a robot is just a machine\nthat's able to act in the world.\nSo, one artificial intelligence\ncould be both just the thinking thing,\nwhich I think is what machine learning is,\nand also the acting thing,\nwhich is what we usually\nthink about robots.\nSo, robots are the things\nthat have a perception system\nthat's able to take in the world\nhowever you define the world,\nis able to think and learn\nand do whatever the hell it does inside,\nand then act on the world.\nSo, that's the difference\nbetween maybe an AI system\nlearning machine and a robot,\nit's something that's able,\na robot is something that's\nable to perceive the world\nand act in the world.\n- So, it could be through\nlanguage or sound,\nor it could be through movement or both.\n- Yeah.\nAnd I think it could also\nbe in the digital space\nas long as there's a aspect of entity\nthat's inside the machine\nand a world that's outside the machine.\nAnd there's a sense in which the machine\nis sensing that world and acting in it.\n- So, we could,\nfor instance, there could\nbe a version of a robot,\naccording to the definition\nthat I think you're providing,\nwhere the robot, where\nI go to sleep at night\nand this robot goes and\nforges for information\nthat it thinks I want to\nsee loaded onto my desktop\nin the morning.\nThere was no movement of that machine,\nthere was no language,\nbut it essentially, has\nmovement in cyberspace.\n- Yeah, there's a distinction\nthat I think is important\nin that there's an element\nof it being an entity,\nwhether it's in the digital\nor the physical space.\nSo, when you have something\nlike Alexa in your home,\nmost of the speech recognition,\nmost of what Alexa is doing,\nis constantly being sent\nback to the mothership.\nWhen Alexa is there on its\nown, that's to me, a robot,\nwhen it's there\ninteracting with the world.\nWhen it's simply a finger\nof the main mothership,\nthen the Alexa is not a robot,\nthen it's just an interaction device,\nthen may be the main Amazon Alexa AI,\nbig, big system is the robot.\nSo, that's important because\nthere's some element,\nto us humans, I think, where\nwe want there to be an entity,\nwhether in the digital\nor the physical space,\nthat's where ideas of\nconsciousness come in\nand all those kinds of things\nthat we project our understanding\nof what it means to be a being.\nAnd so, to take that further,\nwhen does a machine become a robot,\nI think there's a special moment.\nThere's a special moment\nin a person's life\nand in a robot's life\nwhere it surprises you.\nI think surprise is a\nreally powerful thing,\nwhere you know how the thing\nworks and yet it surprises you,\nthat's a magical moment for us humans.\nSo, whether it's a chess-playing program\nthat does something that\nyou haven't seen before,\nthat makes people smile like, huh,\nthose moments happen with\nAlphaZero for the first time\nin chess playing,\nwhere grand masters were\nreally surprised by a move.\nThey didn't understand the move\nand then they studied and studied\nand then they understood it.\nBut that moment of surprise,\nthat's for grandmasters in chess.\nI find that moment of\nsurprise really powerful,\nreally magical in just everyday life.\n- Because it supersedes the\nhuman brain in that moment?\n- So, it's not supersedes,\nlike outperforms,\nbut surprises you in a positive sense.\nLike I didn't think he could do that,\nI didn't think that you had that in you.\nAnd I think that moment is\na big transition for a robot\nfrom a moment of being a servant\nthat accomplishes a particular task\nwith some level of accuracy,\nwith some rate of failure,\nto an entity, a being that's struggling\njust like you are in this world.\nAnd that's a really important moment\nthat I think you're not\ngoing to find many people\nin the AI community that\ntalk like I just did.\nI'm not speaking like some\nphilosopher or some hippie,\nI'm speaking from purely\nengineering perspective.\nI think it's really important\nfor robots to become entities\nand explore that as a\nreal engineering problem,\nas opposed to everybody treats robots\nin the robotics community,\nthey don't even call them or he or she,\nthey don't give them, try\nto avoid giving them names,\nthey've really want to see\nlike a system, like a servant.\nThey see it as a servant that's\ntrying to accomplish a task.\nTo me, and don't think I'm\njust romanticizing the notion,\nI think it's a being, it's a\ncurrently perhaps a dumb being,\nbut in the long arc of history,\nhumans are pretty dumb beings too, so-\n- I would agree with that statement.\n[Andrew laughing]\n- So, I tend to really want to\nexplore this treating robots\nreally as entities, yeah.\nSo, like anthropomorphization,\nwhich is the sort of the act\nof looking at a inanimate object\nand projecting onto it life-like features,\nI think robotics generally\nsees that as a negative,\nI see it as a superpower.\nLike that, we need to use that.\n- Well, I'm struck\nby how that really grabs\nonto the relationship\nbetween human and machine,\nor human and robot.\nSo, I guess the simple question is,\nand I think you've already\ntold us the answer,\nbut does interacting\nwith a robot change you?\nIn other words, do we develop\nrelationships to robots?\n- Yeah, I definitely think so.\nI think the moment you\nsee a robot or AI systems\nas more than just servants but entities,\nthey begin to change you, in\njust like good friends do,\njust like relationships\njust to other humans.\nI think for that,\nyou have to have certain\naspects of that interaction.\nLike the robot's ability to say no,\nto have its own sense of identity,\nto have its own set of goals,\nthat's not constantly serving you,\nbut instead, trying to\nunderstand the world\nand do that dance of understanding\nthrough communication with you.\nSo, I definitely think there's a,\nI mean, I have a lot of thoughts\nabout this as you may know,\nand that's at the core of\nmy life-long dream actually\nof what I want to do,\nwhich is I believe that most people\nhave a notion of loneliness in them\nthat we haven't discovered,\nthat we haven't explored, I should say.\nAnd I see AI systems as\nhelping us explore that\nso that we can become better humans,\nbetter people towards each other.\nSo, I think that connection\nbetween human and AI, human and robot,\nis not only possible, but will\nhelp us understand ourselves\nin ways that are like\nseveral orders of magnitude\ndeeper than we ever could have imagined.\nI tend to believe that [sighing]\nwell, I have very wild levels of belief\nin terms of how impactful\nthat will be, right?\n- So, when I think about\nhuman relationships,\nI don't always break\nthem down into variables,\nbut we could explore a\nfew of those variables\nand see how they map to\nhuman-robot relationships.\nOne is just time, right?\nIf you spend zero time\nwith another person at all\nin cyberspace or on\nthe phone or in person,\nyou essentially have no\nrelationship to them.\nIf you spend a lot of time,\nyou have a relationship,\nthis is obvious.\nBut I guess one variable would be time,\nhow much time you spend\nwith the other entity,\nrobot or human.\nThe other would be wins and successes.\nYou enjoy successes together.\nI'll give a absolutely trivial\nexample this in a moment,\nbut the other would be failures.\nWhen you struggle with somebody,\nwhether or not you struggle\nbetween one another,\nyou disagree,\nlike I was really struck by the fact\nthat you said that robot saying no,\nI've never thought about\na robot saying no to me,\nbut there it is.\n- I look forward to you\nbeing one of the first people\nI send this robots to.\n- So do I.\nSo, there's struggle.\nWhen you struggle with\nsomebody, you grow closer.\nSometimes the struggles\nare imposed between those two people,\nso called trauma bonding,\nthey call it in the whole\npsychology literature\nand pop psychology literature.\nBut in any case, I can imagine.\nSo, time successes\ntogether, struggle together,\nand then just peaceful time,\nhanging out at home, watching movies,\nwaking up near one another,\nhere, we're breaking down\nthe elements of relationships of any kind.\nSo, do you think that these elements\napply to robot-human relationships?\nAnd if so, then I could see how,\nif the robot has its own entity\nand has some autonomy in\nterms of how it reacts you,\nit's not just there just to serve you,\nit's not just a servant,\nit actually has opinions,\nand can tell you when maybe\nyour thinking is flawed,\nor your actions are flawed.\n- It can also leave.\n- It could also leave.\nSo, I've never conceptualized\nrobot-human interactions this way.\nSo, tell me more about\nhow this might look.\nAre we thinking about a\nhuman-appearing robot?\nI know you and I have both had\nintense relationships to our,\nwe have separate dogs obviously,\nbut to animals,\nit sounds a lot like\nhuman-animal interaction.\nSo, what is the ideal\nhuman-robot relationship?\n- So, there's a lot to be said here,\nbut you actually pinpointed one\nof the big, big first steps,\nwhich is this idea of time.\nAnd it's a huge limitation\nin machine-learning community currently.\nNow we're back to like the actual details.\nLife-long learning is a problem space\nthat focuses on how AI systems\ncan learn over a long period of time.\nWhat's currently most\nmachine learning systems\nare not able to do,\nis to all of the things\nyou've listed under time,\nthe successes, the failures,\nor just chilling together watching movies,\nAI systems are not able to do that,\nwhich is all the\nbeautiful, magical moments\nthat I believe are the days filled with,\nthey're not able to keep track\nof those together with you.\n- 'Cause they can't move\nwith you and be with you.\n- No, no, like literally we\ndon't have the techniques\nto do the learning,\nthe actual learning of\ncontaining those moments.\nCurrent machine-learning systems\nare really focused on\nunderstanding the world\nin the following way,\nit's more like the perception system,\nlike looking around, understand\nlike what's in the scene.\nThat there's a bunch\nof people sitting down,\nthat there is cameras and microphones,\nthat there's a table, understand that.\nBut the fact that we shared\nthis moment of talking today,\nand still remember that\nfor like next time you're doing something,\nremember that this moment happened.\nWe don't know how to\ndo that technique-wise.\nThis is what I'm hoping to innovate on\nas I think it's a very,\nvery important component\nof what it means to create\na deeper relationship,\nthat sharing of moments together.\n- Could you post a photo\nof you in the robot,\nlike selfie with robot\nand the robot sees that image\nand recognizes that was time spent,\nthere were smiles, or there were tears-\n- Yeah.\n- And create some sort of\nmetric of emotional depth\nin the relationship and\nupdate its behavior?\n- So.\n- Could it...\nIt texts you in the middle\nof the night and say,\nwhy haven't you texted me back?\n- Well, yes, all of those\nthings, but we can dig into that.\nBut I think that time element,\nforget everything else,\njust sharing moments together,\nthat changes everything.\nI believe that changes everything.\nNow, there's specific things\nthat are more in terms of\nsystems that I can explain you.\nIt's more technical and\nprobably a little bit offline,\n'cause I have kind of wild ideas\nhow that can revolutionize social networks\nand operating systems.\nBut the point is that element alone,\nforget all the other\nthings we're talking about\nlike emotions, saying no, all that,\njust remembering sharing moments together\nwould change everything.\nWe don't currently have systems\nthat share moments together.\nLike even just you and your fridge,\njust all those times,\nyou went late at night\nand ate thing you shouldn't have eaten,\nthat was a secret moment you\nhave with your refrigerator.\nYou shared that moment,\nthat darkness or that beautiful moment\nwhere you were just like\nheartbroken for some reason,\nyou're eating that ice cream or whatever,\nthat's a special moment.\nAnd that refrigerator was there for you,\nand the fact that it\nmissed the opportunity\nto remember that is tragic.\nAnd once it does remember that,\nI think you're going to be very\nattached to the refrigerator.\nYou're going to go through some\nhell with that refrigerator.\nMost of us have, like\nin the developed world,\nhave weird relationships with food, right?\nSo, you can go through some deep moments\nof trauma and triumph with food,\nand at the core of that,\nis the refrigerator.\nSo, a smart refrigerator, I\nbelieve would change society.\nNot just the refrigerator,\nbut these ideas in the\nsystems all around us.\nSo, I just want to comment\non how powerful that idea of time is.\nAnd then there's a bunch of elements\nof actual interaction of\nallowing you as a human\nto feel like you're being heard.\nTruly heard, truly understood,\nthat we human, like deep\nfriendship is like that, I think,\nbut there's still an\nelement of selfishness,\nthere's still an element\nof not really being able to\nunderstand another human.\nAnd a lot of the times\nwhen you're going through trauma together,\nthrough difficult times\nand through successes,\nyou actually starting\nto get that inkling of\nunderstanding of each other,\nbut I think\nthat could be done more\naggressively, more efficiently.\nLike if you think of a great therapist,\nI think I've never actually\nbeen to a therapist,\nbut I'm a believer I used to\nwant to be a psychiatrist.\n- Do Russians go to therapists?\n- No, they don't.\nThey don't.\nAnd if they do, the therapist\ndon't live to tell the story.\nI do believe in talk therapy,\nwhich friendship is to\nme, is it's talk therapy,\nor like you don't even necessarily\nneed to talk [laughing]\nit's like just connecting\nthrough in the space of ideas\nand the space of experiences.\nAnd I think there's a lot of ideas\nof how to make AI systems\nto be able to ask the right questions\nand truly hear another human.\nThis is what we try to do\nwith podcasting, right?\nI think there's ways to do that with AI.\nBut above all else,\njust remembering the collection of moments\nthat make up the day,\nthe week, the months,\nI think you maybe have\nsome of this as well.\nSome of my closest friends\nstill are the friends from high school.\nThat's time, we've been\nthrough a bunch of together,\nand that like we're very different people.\nBut just the fact that\nwe've been through that,\nand we remember those moments,\nand those moments somehow\ncreate a depth of connection\nlike nothing else, like\nyou and your refrigerator.\n- I love that because my graduate advisor,\nshe unfortunately, she passed away,\nbut when she passed away,\nsomebody said at her at her memorial\nall these amazing things\nshe had done, et cetera.\nAnd then her kids got up there,\nand she had young children and that I knew\nas when she was pregnant with them.\nAnd so, it was really,\nyou're even now I can feel\nlike your heart gets heavy,\nthinking about this,\nthey're going to grow\nup without their mother.\nAnd it was really amazing,\nvery strong young girls,\nand now the young women.\nAnd what they said was incredible,\nthey said what they\nreally appreciated most\nabout their mother, who\nwas an amazing person,\nis all the unstructured\ntime they spent together.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- So, it wasn't the trips to the zoo,\nit wasn't she woke up\nat five in the morning\nand drove us to school.\nShe did all those things too.\nShe had two hour commute\nin each direction,\nit was incredible, ran a lab, et cetera,\nbut it was the unstructured time.\nSo, on the passing of their mother,\nthat's what they remembered\nwas that the biggest give\nand what bonded them to her,\nwas all the time where\nthey just kind of hung out.\nAnd the way you describe the\nrelationship to a refrigerator\nis so, I want to say human-like,\nbut I'm almost reluctant to say that.\nBecause what I'm realizing\nas we're talking,\nis that what we think of as human-like\nmight actually be the\nlower form of relationship.\nThere may be relationships\nthat are far better\nthan the sorts of relationships\nthat we can conceive\nin our minds right now\nbased on what these machine\nrelationship interactions\ncould teach us.\nDo I have that right?\n- Yeah, I think so.\nI think there's no reason to see machines\nas somehow incapable of\nteaching us something\nthat's deeply human.\nI don't think humans\nhave a monopoly on that.\nI think we understand\nourselves very poorly\nand we need to have the kind\nof prompting from a machine.\nAnd definitely part of that,\nis just remembering the moments.\nI think the unstructured time together,\nI wonder if it's quite so unstructured.\nThat's like calling this\npodcast on structured time.\n- Maybe what they meant,\nwas it wasn't a big outing,\nthere was no specific goal,\nbut a goal was created\nthrough the lack of a goal.\nLike we would just hang out\nand then you start playing, thumb war,\nand you end up playing\nthumb war for an hour.\nSo, it's the structure emerges\nfrom lack of structure.\n- No, but the thing is the moments,\nthere's something about those times\nthat creates special moments,\nand I think those could be optimized for.\nI think we think of like a big outing as,\nI don't know, going to\nSix Flags or something,\nor some big, the Grand Canyon,\nor go into some, I don't know,\nI think we would need to,\nwe don't quite yet understand, as humans,\nwhat creates magical moments.\nI think it's possible to\noptimize a lot of those things.\nAnd perhaps like podcasting is\nhelping people discover that,\nlike maybe the thing\nwe want to optimize for\nisn't necessarily like some\nsexy, like quick clips,\nmaybe what we want, is\nlong-form authenticity.\n- Depth.\n- Depth.\nSo, we were trying to figure that out,\ncertainly from a deep connection\nbetween humans and humans and NAS systems,\nI think long conversations, or\nlong periods of communication\nover a series of moments like my new,\nperhaps, seemingly\ninsignificant to the big ones,\nthe big successes, the big failures,\nthose are all just\nstitching those together\nand talking throughout.\nI think that's the formula\nfor a really, really deep connection.\nThat from like a very specific\nengineering perspective,\nis I think a fascinating open problem\nthat has been really worked on very much.\nAnd for me, from a, if I have the guts\nand, I mean there's a\nlot of things to say,\nbut one of it is guts, is I'll\nbuild a startup around it.\n- So, let's talk about this startup\nand let's talk about the dream.\nYou mentioned this dream before\nin our previous conversations,\nalways as little hints\ndropped here and there.\nJust for anyone listening,\nthere's never been an offline\nconversation about this dream,\nI'm not privy to anything,\nexcept what Lex says now.\nAnd I realized that there's no way\nto capture the full essence of a dream\nin any kind of verbal statement\nin a way that captures all of it.\nBut what is this dream\nthat you've referred to now several times\nwhen we've sat down together\nand talked on the phone?\nMaybe it's this company,\nmaybe it's something distinct.\nIf you feel comfortable,\nit'd be great if you\ncould share a little bit\nabout what that is.\n- Sure.\nSo, the way people\nexpress long-term vision,\nI've noticed is quite different.\nLike Elon is an example of somebody\nwho can very crisply say\nexactly what the goal is.\nAlso has to do with the fact\nthat problems he's solving\nhave nothing to do with humans.\nSo, my long-term vision\nis a little bit more\ndifficult to express in words,\nI've noticed, as I've tried,\nit could be my brain's failure,\nbut there's a way to sneak up to it.\nSo, let me just say a few things.\nEarly on in life and\nalso in the recent years,\nI've interacted with a few robots\nwhere I understood there's magic there.\nAnd that magic could be shared by millions\nif it's brought to light.\nWhen I first met Spot\nfrom Boston Dynamics,\nI realized there's magic there\nthat nobody else is seeing.\n- Is the dog.\n- The dog, sorry.\nThe Spot is the four-legged\nrobot from Boston Dynamics.\nSome people might have seen\nit, it's this yellow dog.\nAnd sometimes in life,\nyou just notice something\nthat just grabs you.\nAnd I believe that this is something\nthat this magic is something that could be\nin every single device in the world.\nThe way that I think maybe Steve Jobs\nthought about the personal computer,\nlaws didn't think about the\npersonal computer this way,\nbut Steve did.\nWhich is like, he thought\nthat the personal computer\nshould be as thin as a sheet of paper\nand everybody should have one,\nand this idea,\nI think it is heartbreaking\nthat we're getting,\nthe world is being filled up with machines\nthat are soulless.\nAnd I think every one of them\ncan have that same magic.\nOne of the things that also inspired me\nin terms of a startup,\nis that magic can engineered\nmuch easier than I thought.\nThat's my intuition\nwith everything I've\never built and worked on.\nSo, the dream is to\nadd a bit of that magic\nin every single computing\nsystem in the world.\nSo, the way that Windows\nOperating System for a long time\nwas the primary operating system\neverybody interacted with,\nthey built apps on top of it.\nI think this is something\nthat should be as a layer,\nit's almost as an operating system\nin every device that humans\ninteracted with in the world.\nNow, what that actually looks like,\nthe actual dream when\nI was officially a kid,\nit didn't have this\nconcrete form of a business,\nit had more of a dream of\nexploring your own loneliness\nby interacting with machines, robots.\nThis deep connection\nbetween humans and robots\nwas always a dream.\nAnd so, for me,\nI'd love to see a world where\nthere's every home as a robot,\nand not a robot that washes\nthe dishes, or a sex robot,\nor I don't know,\nthink of any kind of\nactivity the robot can do,\nbut more like a companion.\n- A family member.\n- A family member, the way a dog is.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- But a dog that's able to\nspeak your language too.\nSo, not just connect the way\na dog does by looking at you\nand looking away\nand almost like smiling with\nits soul in that kind of way,\nbut also to actually\nunderstand what the hell,\nlike, why are you so\nexcited about the successes?\nLike understand the details,\nunderstand the traumas.\nAnd that, I just think [sighing]\nthat has always filled me\nwith excitement that I could,\nwith artificial intelligence,\nbring joy to a lot of people.\nMore recently, I've been\nmore and more heartbroken\nto see the kind of division, derision,\neven hate that's boiling\nup on the internet\nthrough social networks.\nAnd I thought this kind of\nmechanism is exactly applicable\nin the context of social networks as well.\nSo, it's an operating system\nthat serves as your guide\non the internet.\nOne of the biggest problems\nwith YouTube and social\nnetworks currently,\nis they're optimizing for engagement.\nI think if you create AI systems\nthat know each individual person,\nyou're able to optimize\nfor long-term growth\nfor a long-term happiness.\n- Of the individual, or-\n- Of the individual, of the individual.\nAnd there's a lot of other things to say,\nwhich is in order for AI systems\nto learn everything about you,\nthey need to collect,\nthey need to just like you\nand I when we talk offline,\nwe're collecting data\nabout each others\nsecrets about each other,\nthe same way AI has to do that.\nAnd that allows you to,\nand that requires you to rethink\nideas of ownership of data.\nI think each individual\nshould own all of their data\nand very easily be able to leave\njust like AI systems can leave,\nhumans can disappear\nand delete all of their\ndata in a moment's notice.\nWhich is actually better\nthan we humans can do,\nis once we load the data\ninto each other, it's there.\nI think it's very important to be both,\ngive people complete\ncontrol over their data\nin order to establish trust\nthat they can trust you.\nAnd the second part of\ntrust is transparency.\nWhenever the data is used\nto make it very clear\nwhat is being used for.\nAnd not clear in a lawyerly legal sense,\nbut clear in a way that people\nreally understand what it's used for.\nI believe when people have the ability\nto delete all their data and walk away\nand know how the data is being\nused, I think they'll stay.\n- The possibility of a clean breakup,\nis actually what will\nkeep people together.\n- Yeah, I think so.\nI think, exactly.\nI think a happy marriage\nacquires the ability to divorce easily\nwithout the divorce industrial\ncomplex or whatever.\nThings currently going on\nand then there's so much money to be made\nfrom lawyers and divorce.\nBut yeah, the ability to leave\nis what enables love, I think.\n- It's interesting.\nI've heard the phrase from\na semi-cynical friend,\nthat marriage is the\nleading cause of divorce,\nbut now we've heard that divorce,\nor the possibility of divorce\ncould be the leading cause of marriage.\n- Of a happy marriage.\n- Good point.\n- Of a happy marriage.\nSo, yeah.\nSo, there's a lot of details there,\nbut the big dream\nis that connection between\nAI system and a human.\nAnd I haven't.\nThere's so much fear\nabout artificial intelligence\nsystems and about robots\nthat I haven't quite found the right words\nto express that vision\nbecause the vision I have,\nit's not like some\nnaive, delusional vision\nof like technology is\ngoing to save everybody,\nit's I really do just have a positive view\nof ways AI systems can help\nhumans explore themselves.\n- I love that positivity\nand I agree that the stance everything\nis doomed is equally bad\nto say that everything's\ngoing to turn out all right,\nthere has to be a dedicated effort.\nAnd clearly, you're thinking\nabout what that dedicated\neffort would look like.\nYou mentioned two aspects to\nthis dream [clears throat]\nand I want to make sure\nthat I understand where\nthey connect if they do,\nor if they are independent streams.\nOne was this hypothetical\nrobot family member,\nor some other form of robot\nthat would allow people to\nexperience the kind of delight\nthat you experienced many times,\nand that you would like the\nworld to be able to have,\nand it's such a beautiful\nidea of this give.\nAnd the other is social media\nor social network platforms\nthat really serve individuals\nand their best selves and their\nhappiness and their growth.\nIs there crossover between those,\nor are these two parallel dreams?\n- It's 100% of the same thing.\nIt's difficult to kind of explain\nwithout going through details,\nbut maybe one easy way to explain\nthe way I think about social networks,\nis to create an AI system that's yours.\nIt's not like Amazon\nAlexa that's centralized,\nyou own the data,\nit's like your little friend\nthat becomes your\nrepresentative on Twitter\nthat helps you find things\nthat will make you feel good,\nthat will also challenge your\nthinking to make you grow,\nbut not get to that,\nnot let you get lost in the\nnegative spiral of dopamine,\nthat gets you to be angry,\nor most just get you to\nbe not open to learning.\nAnd so, that little representative\nis optimizing your long-term health.\nAnd I believe that that is not\nonly good for human beings,\nit's also good for business.\nI think longterm, you\ncan make a lot of money\nby challenging this idea that\nthe only way to make money,\nis maximizing engagement.\nAnd one of the things that\npeople disagree with me on,\nis they think Twitter's\nalways going to win.\nLike maximizing engagement\nis always going to win,\nI don't think so.\nI think people have woken up\nnow to understanding that,\nlike they don't always feel good,\nthe ones who are on Twitter a lot,\nthat they don't always feel\ngood at the end of the week.\n- I would love feedback\nfrom whatever this creature, whatever,\nI don't know what to call it,\nas to maybe at the end of the week,\nit would automatically unfollow\nsome of the people that I follow\nbecause it realized through\nsome really smart data\nabout how I was feeling\ninside, or how I was sleeping,\nor something that, I don't know,\nthat just wasn't good for me.\nBut it might also put things\nand people in front of me\nthat I ought to see,\nis that kind of a sliver\nof what this look like?\n- The whole point, because\nof the interaction,\nbecause of sharing the moments\nand learning a lot about you,\nyou're now able to\nunderstand what interactions\nled you to become a better\nversion of yourself.\nLike the person you\nyourself are happy with.\nThis isn't,\nif you're into flat earth and\nyou feel very good about it,\nthat you believe that earth is flat,\nlike the idea that you should\nsensor that is ridiculous.\nIf it makes you feel good\nand you becoming the\nbest version of yourself,\nI think you should be getting\nas much flat earth as possible.\nNow, it's also good to\nchallenge your ideas,\nbut not because the\ncentralized committee decided,\nbut because you tell to the system\nthat you like challenging your\nideas, I think all of us do.\nAnd then, which actually\nYouTube doesn't do that well,\nonce you go down the\nflat-earth rabbit hole,\nthat's all you're going to see.\nIt's nice to get some really\npowerful communicators\nto argue against flat earth.\nAnd it's nice to see that for you,\nand potentially, at least\nlong-term to expand your horizons,\nmaybe the earth is not flat.\nBut if you continue to\nlive your whole life\nthinking the earth is flat,\nI think, and you're being a\ngood father or son or daughter,\nand like you're being the\nbest version of yourself\nand you're happy with yourself,\nI think the earth is flat.\nSo, like I think this kind of idea,\nand I'm just using that kind\nof silly, ridiculous example\nbecause I don't like the\nidea of centralized forces\ncontrolling what you can and can't see,\nbut I also don't like this idea\nof like not censoring anything.\nBecause that's always the\nbiggest problem with that,\nis this there's a central decider,\nI think you yourself can decide\nwhat you want to see and not,\nand it's good to have a\ncompanion that reminds you\nthat you felt last time you did this,\nor you felt good last time you did this.\n- Man, I feel like in every good story,\nthere's a guide or a\ncompanion that flies out,\nor forges a little bit further,\na little bit differently\nand brings back information that helps us,\nor at least tries to steer\nus in the right direction.\n- So, yeah, that's\nexactly what I'm thinking\nand what I've been working on.\nI should mention as a\nbunch of difficulties here,\nyou see me up and down\na little bit recently.\nSo, there's technically\na lot of challenges here.\nJust like with a lot of technologies,\nand the reason I'm talking about it\non a podcast comfortably as\nopposed to working in secret,\nis it's really hard and\nmaybe it's time has not come.\nAnd that's something you have\nto constantly struggle with\nin terms of like\nentrepreneurially as a startup,\nlike I've also mentioned\nto you, maybe offline,\nI really don't care about money,\nI don't care about business success,\nall those kinds of things.\nSo, it's a difficult decision to make,\nhow much of your time do\nyou want to go all in here\nand give everything to this?\nIt's a big roll the dice.\nBecause I've also realized\nthat's working on some of these problems,\nboth with the robotics\nand the technical side\nin terms of the machine-learning\nsystem that I'm describing,\nit's lonely, it's really lonely.\nBecause both on a personal\nlevel and a technical level.\nSo, on the technical level,\nI'm surrounded by people\nthat kind of doubt me,\nwhich I think all\nentrepreneurs go through.\nAnd they doubt you in the following sense,\nthey know how difficult it is.\nLike the people that\nthe colleagues of mine,\nthey know how difficult\nlife-long learning is,\nthey also know how difficult it is\nto build a system like this,\nto build the competitive social network.\nAnd in general,\nthere's a kind of a loneliness\nto just working on something on your own\nfor long periods of time.\nAnd you start to doubt whether,\ngiven that you don't have\na track record of success,\nlike that's a big one.\nBut when you look in the mirror,\nespecially when you're young,\nbut I still have that, I'm most things,\nyou look in the mirror,\nit's like, and you have these big dreams,\nhow do you know\nyou're actually as smart\nas you think you are?\nLike how do you know\nyou're going to be able\nto accomplish this dream?\nYou have this ambition.\n- You sort of don't,\nbut you're kind of pulling on a string\nhoping that there's a bigger ball of yarn.\n- Yeah.\n[Andrew laughing]\nBut you have this kind of intuition.\nI think I pride myself in\nknowing what I'm good at,\nbecause the reason I have that intuition,\nis 'cause I think I'm very good\nat knowing all the things I suck at,\nwhich is basically everything.\nSo, like whenever I notice like,\nwait a minute, I'm kind of good at this,\nwhich is very rare for me.\nI think like that,\nthat might be a ball of\nyarn worth pulling at.\nAnd the thing with in terms\nof engineering systems\nthat are able to interact with humans,\nI think I'm very good at that.\nAnd because we talk about\npodcasting and so on,\nI don't know if I'm very good at podcasts.\n- You're very good at podcasting, right?\n- But I certainly don't,\nI think maybe it is compelling for people\nto watch a kindhearted idiot\nstruggle with this form,\nmaybe that's what's compelling.\nBut in terms of like actual\nbeing a good engineer\nof human-robot interaction\nsystems, I think I'm good.\nBut it's hard to know until you do it,\nand then the world keeps\ntelling you you're not,\nand it's full of doll, it's really hard.\nAnd I've been struggling\nwith that recently,\nit's kind of a fascinating struggle.\nBut then that's where the\nGoggins thing comes in,\nis like, aside from the\nstate-hard motherfucker, is the,\nlike whenever you're struggling,\nthat's a good sign that if you keep going,\nthat you're going to be\nalone in the success, right?\n- Well, in your case, however, I agree.\nAnd actually David had a post recently\nthat I thought was among\nhis many brilliant posts,\nwas one of the more brilliant\nabout how he talked about this myth\nof the light at the end of the tunnel.\nAnd instead, what he\nreplaced that myth with,\nwas a concept that eventually,\nyour eyes adapt to the dark.\nThat the tunnel, it's not\nabout a light at the end,\nthat it's really about adapting\nto the dark of the tunnel.\nIt's very Goggins-\n- I love him so much.\n- Yeah.\nYou got share a lot in common\nknowing you both a bit,\nshare a lot in common.\nBut in this loneliness and\nthe pursuit of this dream,\nit seems to me,\nit has a certain component to\nit that is extremely valuable,\nwhich is that the loneliness itself\ncould serve as a driver\nto build the companion for the journey.\n- Well, I'm very deeply aware of that.\nSo, like some people can make,\n'cause I talk about love a lot,\nI really love everything in this world,\nbut I also love humans,\nfriendship and romantic,\nlike even the cheesy stuff, just-\n- You like romantic movies?\n- Yeah, not those, not necessarily.\nSo, well, I got so much\nfrom Rogan about like,\nwas it the Tango scene\nfrom \"Scent of a Woman,\"\nbut I find like there's nothing better\nthan a woman in a red\ndress, just like the classy-\n- You should move to Argentina my friend.\nMy father's Argentine,\nand you know what he said\nwhen I went on your\npodcast for the first time?\nHe said, he dresses well.\nBecause in Argentina,\nthe men go to a wedding\nor a party or something,\nin the U.S., by halfway through the night,\n10 minutes in the night,\nall the jackets are off.\n- Yeah.\n- It looks like everyone's\nundressing for the party\nthey just got dressed up for.\nAnd he said, you know, I\nliked the way he dresses.\nAnd then when I started,\nhe was talking about you.\nAnd then when I started\nmy podcast, he said,\nwhy don't you wear a real\nsuit like your friend Lex?\n[laughing]\n- I remember that.\n- No, you can't.\nBut let's talk about this\npursuit just a bit more,\nbecause I think what you're talking about,\nis building a, not just a\nsolution for loneliness,\nbut you've alluded to\nthe loneliness as itself,\nan important thing.\nAnd I think you're right.\nI think within people,\nthere is like caverns of faults and shame,\nbut also just the desire\nto have resonance,\nto be seen and heard.\nAnd I don't even know\nthat it's seen and heard through language.\nBut these reservoirs of loneliness,\nI think, well, they're interesting,\nmaybe you could comment\na little bit about it.\nBecause just as often\nas you talk about love,\nI haven't quantified it,\nbut it seems that you talk\nabout this loneliness,\nand maybe you just if you're willing,\nyou'll share a little bit more about that,\nand what that feels like now\nin the pursuit of building\nthis robot-human relationship.\nAnd you've been, let me be direct,\nyou've been spending a lot of time\non building a robot-human\nrelationship, where's that at?\n- Oh, in terms of business,\nin terms of systems?\n- No, I'm talking about a specific robot.\n- Oh [laughing]\nso, okay, I should mention a few things.\nSo, one, is there's a startup with an idea\nwhere I hope millions of people can use.\nAnd then there's my own personal\nlike almost like Frankenstein explorations\nwith particular robots.\nSo, I'm very fascinated with\nthe legged robots in my own,\nprivate sounds like dark,\nbut like in of one experiments\nto see if I can recreate the magic.\nAnd that's been,\nI have a lot of really good\nalready perception systems\nand control systems that are\nable to communicate affection\nin a dog-like fashion.\nSo, I'm in a really good place there.\nThe stumbling blocks,\nwhich also have been part\nof my sadness recently,\nis that I also have to work\nwith robotics companies\nthat I gave so much of my heart, soul\nand love and appreciation\ntowards Boston Dynamics,\nbut Boston Dynamics has also,\nas a company, it has\nto make a lot of money\nand they have marketing teams.\nAnd they're like looking\nat this silly Russian kid\nin a suit and tie,\nit's like, what's he trying to do\nwith all this love and robot interaction\nand dancing and so on?\nSo, there was a, I\nthink let's say for now,\nit's like, when you break up\nwith a girlfriend or something,\nright now, we decided to part\nways on this particular thing.\nThey're huge supporters of\nmine, they're huge fans,\nbut on this particular thing,\nBoston Dynamics is not focusing on,\nor interested in human-robot interaction.\nIn fact, their whole business currently,\nis keep the robot as far\naway from humans as possible\nbecause it's an in the industrial setting\nwhere it's doing monitoring\nin dangerous environments.\nIt's almost like a remote security camera,\nessentially is its application.\nTo me, I thought it's still,\neven in those applications,\nexceptionally useful\nfor the robot to be able to\nperceive humans, like see humans\nand to be able to, in a big map,\nlocalize where those humans\nare and have human intention.\nFor example, like this,\nI did this a lot of work with pedestrians,\nfor a robot to be able to anticipate\nwhat the how the human is\ndoing, like where it's walking.\nThe humans are not ballistics object,\njust because you're walking\nthis way one moment,\nit doesn't mean you'll keep\nwalking that direction,\nyou have to infer a lot of signals,\nespecially with the head\nmovement and the eye movement.\nAnd so, I thought that's\nsuper interesting to explore,\nbut they didn't feel that.\nSo, I'll be working with a\nfew other robotics companies\nthat are much more open\nto that kind of stuff,\nand they're super\nexcited and fans of mine.\nAnd hopefully, Boston\nDynamics, my first love,\nlike getting back with an\nex-girlfriend, will come around.\nBut so, the algorithmically,\nit's basically a done there.\nThe rest, is actually getting\nsome of these companies\nto work with.\nAnd then there's,\nfor people who'd worked with robots\nknow that one thing is to\nwrite software that works,\nand the other is to have a real\nmachine that actually works.\nAnd it breaks down all\nkinds of different ways\nthat are fascinating.\nAnd so, there's a big challenge there.\nBut that's almost,\nit may sound a little bit confusing\nin the context of our previous discussion\nbecause the previous discussion\nwas more about the big dream,\nhow I hoped to have millions of people\nenjoy this moment of magic.\nThis current discussion about a robot,\nis something I personally really enjoy,\njust brings me happiness,\nI really try to do now everything\nthat just brings me joy,\nI maximize that 'cause robots are awesome.\nBut two, given my like\nlittle bit growing platform,\nI want to use the opportunity\nto educate people.\nLike robots are cool.\nAnd if I think they're cool,\nI hope be able to communicate\nwhy they're cool to others.\nSo, this little robot experiment\nis a little bit of research project too,\nthere's a couple of publications\nwith MIT folks around that.\nBut the other is just\nto make some cool videos\nand explain to people\nhow they actually work.\nAnd as opposed to people\nbeing scared of robots,\nthey could still be\nscared, but also excited,\nlike see the dark side,\nthe beautiful side,\nthe magic of what it means to bring,\nfor a machine to become a robot.\nI want to inspire people with that.\nBut that's less,\nit's interesting because\nI think the big impact\nin terms of the dream does not\nhave to do with embodied AI.\nSo, it does not need to have a body.\nI think the refrigerator's enough,\nthat for an AI system just to\nhave a voice and to hear you,\nthat's enough for loneliness.\nThe embodiment is just-\n- By embodiment, you mean\nthe physical structure.\n- Physical instantiation of intelligence.\nSo, it's a legged robot,\nor even just a thing.\nI have a few other of humanoid robot,\na little humanoid robot maybe\nI'll keep them on the table,\nis like walks around,\nor even just like a mobile platform\nthey can just like, turn\naround and look at you,\nit's like we mentioned with the pen.\nSomething that moves and can look at you,\nit's like that Butter Robot\nthat asks, what is my purpose?\nThat is really, it's almost like art.\nThere's something about a\nphysical entity that moves around,\nthat's able to look at\nyou and interact with you,\nthat makes you wonder\nwhat it means to be human.\nIt like challenges you to think,\nif that thing looks like\nhe has consciousness,\nwhat the hell am I?\nAnd I like that feeling,\nI think that's really useful for us,\nit's humbling for us humans.\nBut that's less about research,\nit certainly less about business\nand more about exploring our own selves,\nand challenging others to think like,\nto think about what makes them human.\n- I love this desire\nto share the delight of an\ninteraction with a robot.\nAnd as you describe it,\nI actually find myself\nstarting to crave that\nbecause we all have those\nelements from childhood where,\nor from adulthood, where\nwe experience something,\nwe want other people to feel that.\nAnd I think that you're right,\nI think a lot of people are scared of AI,\nI think a lot of people\nare scared of robots.\nMy only experience, and\nof a robotic-like thing\nis my Roomba Vacuum, where it goes about,\nactually, it was pretty good\nat picking up Costello's hair\nwhen he was shed and\nI was grateful for it.\nBut then when I was on\na call or something,\nand it would get caught\non a wire or something,\nI would find myself getting\nupset with the Roomba\nin that moment, I'm\nlike, what are you doing?\nAnd obviously it's just\ndoing what it does.\nBut that's a kind of mostly positive,\nbut slightly negative interaction.\nBut what you're describing,\nit has so much more richness\nand layers of detail\nthat I can only imagine what\nthose relationships are like.\n- Well, there's a few,\njust a quick comment.\nSo, I've had, they're currently in Boston\nand I have a bunch of Roombas from iRobot.\nAnd I did this experiment-\n- Wait, how many Roombas?\n[Lex laughing]\nIt sounds like a fleet of Roombas.\n- Yeah.\nSo, it's probably seven or eight, yeah.\n- Well, it's a lot of Roombas.\nThis place is very clean.\n- Well, so, this, I'm kind of waiting,\nthis is the place we're\ncurrently in Austin,\nis way larger than I need.\nBut I basically got it to make\nsure I have room for robots.\n- So, you have these seven or so Roombas,\nyou deploy all seven at once?\n- Oh, no, I do different\nexperience with them,\ndifferent experiments with them.\nSo, one of the things I want\nto mention, is this is a,\nI think there was a YouTube video\nthat inspired me to try this,\nis I got them to scream\nin pain and moan in pain\nwhenever they were kicked or contacted.\nAnd I did that experiment\nto see how I would feel.\nI meant to do like a YouTube video on it,\nbut then it just seemed very cruel.\n- Did any Roomba rights\nactivists come at you?\n- Like I think if I released that video,\nI think it's going to make me look insane,\nwhich I know people\nknow I'm already insane-\n- Now, you have to release the video.\n[Lex laughing]\n- Sure.\nWell, I think maybe if I contextualize it\nby showing other robots\nlike to show why this is fascinating,\nbecause ultimately,\nI felt like there were\nhuman almost immediately.\nAnd that display of\npain was what did that.\n- Giving them a voice.\n- Giving them a voice,\nespecially a voice of dislike, of pain.\n- I have to connect you\nto my friend Eddie Chang,\nhe studied speech and\nlanguage, he's a neurosurgeon,\nand we're life-long friends.\nHe studied speech and language,\nbut he describes some\nof these more primitive,\nvisceral vocalizations, cries,\ngroans, moans of delight,\nother sounds as well,\nuse your imagination,\nas such powerful rudders for the other,\nfor the emotions of other people.\nAnd so, I find it fascinating,\nI can't wait to see this video.\nSo, is the video available online?\n- No, I haven't recorded it,\nI just hit a bunch of Roombas\nthat are able to scream in\npain in my Boston place.\n[Andrew laughing]\nSo, like people already-\n- Next podcast episode with Lex,\nmaybe we'll have that one, who knows?\n- So, the thing is like people,\nI've noticed because I\ntalk so much about love\nand it's really who I am,\nI think they want to,\nto a lot of people,\nseems like there's there\ngot to be a dark person\nin there somewhere.\nAnd I thought if I release\nvideos of Roombas screaming\nand they're like, yep, yep,\nthat guy's definitely insane.\n- What about like shouts\nof glee and delight,\nyou could do that too, right?\n- Well, I don't know how to,\nto me, delight is quiet, right?\n- You're a Russian.\nAmericans are much louder than Russians.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah.\nBut like I don't, unless\nyou're talking about like,\nI don't know\nhow you would have sexual\nrelationships with the Roomba.\n- Well, I wasn't necessarily\nsaying a sexual delight, but-\n- Trust me, I tried.\nI'm just kidding, that's a joke, internet.\nOkay [giggles]\nbut I was fascinated in the psychology\nof how little it took.\n'Cause you mentioned\nyou had a negative\nrelationship with a Roomba.\n- Well, I'd find that mostly,\nI took it for granted.\n- Yeah.\n- It just served me, it\ncollected Costello's hair.\nAnd then when it would do\nsomething I didn't like,\nI would get upset with it.\nSo, that's not a good relationship,\nit was taken for granted\nand I would get upset and\nthen I'd park it again,\nand I just like you're in the corner.\n- Yeah.\n- But there's a way to\nframe it being quite dumb\nas almost cute.\nYou're almost connecting\nwith it for its dumbness.\nAnd I think that's artificial\nintelligence problem.\n- [Andrew] It's interesting.\n- I think flaws should\nbe feature, not a bug.\n- So, along the lines of this,\nthe different sorts of relationships\nthat one could have with robots,\nand the fear, but also some\nof the positive relationships\nthat one could have,\nthere's so much dimensionality,\nthere's so much to explore.\nBut power dynamics in\nrelationships are very interesting,\nbecause the obvious ones,\nthe unsophisticated view of this,\nis one, there's a master\nand a servant, right?\nBut there's also manipulation,\nthere's benevolent manipulation,\nchildren do this with\nparents, puppies do this.\nPuppies turn their head and look cute\nand maybe give out a little noise,\nkids coup and parents always\nthink that they're doing this\nbecause they love the parent,\nbut in many ways,\nstudies show that those coups are ways\nto extract the sorts of\nbehaviors and expressions\nfrom the parent that they want.\nThe child doesn't know it's doing this,\nit's completely subconscious,\nbut it's benevolent manipulation.\nSo, there's one version of fear of robots\nthat I hear a lot about\nthat I think most people can relate to\nwhere the robots take over\nand they become the masters\nand we become the servants.\nBut there could be another version\nthat in certain communities\nthat I'm certainly not a part of,\nbut they call topping from the bottom,\nwhere the robot is\nactually manipulating you\ninto doing things,\nbut you are under the belief\nthat you are in charge,\nbut actually they're in charge.\nAnd so, I think that's one\nthat if we could explore\nthat for a second,\nyou could imagine it\nwouldn't necessarily be bad,\nalthough it could lead to bad things.\nThe reason I want to explore this,\nis I think people always\ndefault to the extreme,\nlike the robots take over and\nwe're in little jail cells\nand they're out having fun\nand ruling the universe.\nWhat sorts of manipulation\ncan a robot potentially\ncarry out, good or bad?\n- Yeah.\nJust so, there's a lot of\ngood and bad manipulation\nbetween humans, right?\nJust like you said.\n[Lex sighing]\nTo me [sighing] especially\nlike you said [giggles]\ntopping from the bottom, is that the term?\n- I think someone from\nMIT told me that term.\n[Lex laughing]\nIt wasn't Lex.\n- I think.\nSo, first of all, there's\npower dynamics in bed,\nand power dynamics in relationships,\nand power dynamics on the street,\nand in the work environment,\nthose are all very different.\nI think power dynamics can\nmake human relationships,\nespecially romantic relationships\nfascinating and rich\nand fulfilling and exciting\nand all those kinds of things.\nSo, I don't think in\nthemselves they're bad,\nand the same goes with robots.\nI really love the idea\nthat a robot will be at top or a bottom\nin terms of like power dynamics.\nAnd I think everybody\nshould be aware of that.\nAnd the manipulation is\nnot so much manipulation,\nbut a dance of like pulling\naway, a push and pull,\nand all those kinds of things.\nIn terms of control,\nI think we're very, very,\nvery far away from AI systems\nthat are able to lock us up.\nTo lock us up in,\nlike to have so much control\nthat we basically cannot live our lives\nin the way that we want.\nI think there's a, in terms\nof dangers of AI systems,\nthere's much more dangers\nthat have to do with\nautonomous weapon systems\nand all those kinds of things.\nSo, the power dynamics as\nexercised in the struggle\nbetween nations and war and\nall those kinds of things.\nBut in terms of personal relationships,\nI think power dynamics\nare a beautiful thing.\nNow, there's of course,\ngoing to be all those kinds of discussions\nabout consent and rights and\nall those kinds of things.\n- Well, here, we're talking about,\nI always say in any\ndiscussion around this,\nif we need to define a really the context,\nit always should be\nconsensual, age-appropriate,\ncontext-appropriate, species-appropriate,\nbut now we're talking about\nhuman-robot interactions.\nAnd so, I guess that-\n- No, I actually was trying\nto make a different point,\nwhich is I do believe\nthat robots will have\nrights down the line.\nAnd I think in order for us\nto have deep, meaningful\nrelationships with robots,\nwe would have to consider\nthem as entities in themselves\nthat deserve respect.\nAnd that's a really interesting concept\nthat I think people are\nstarting to talk about\na little bit more,\nbut it's very difficult\nfor us to understand\nhow entities that are other than human.\nI mean, the same as with\ndogs and other animals\ncan have rights on a level as humans.\n- Well, yeah.\nWe can't and nor should we do\nwhatever we want with animals,\nwe have a USDA, we have\nDepartment of Agriculture\nthat deal with animal care and\nuse committees for research,\nfor farming and ranching and all that.\nSo, when you first said it,\nI thought, wait, why would,\nthere'll be a bill of robotic rights,\nbut it absolutely makes sense\nin the context of everything\nwe've been talking about\nup until now.\nIf you're willing, I'd\nlove to talk about dogs,\nbecause you've mentioned\ndogs a couple of times,\na robot dog, you had a biological dog.\nYeah.\n- Yeah.\nI had a Newfoundland named\nHomer for many years growing up.\n- In Russia or in the U.S.?\n- In the United States.\nAnd he was about, he's over\n200 pounds, that's a big dog.\n- That's a big dog.\n- People know Newfoundland.\nSo, he's this black dog\nthat's a really a long hair\nand just a kind soul.\nI think perhaps that's\ntrue for a lot of large,\nbut he thought he was a small dog.\nSo, he moved like that, and-\n- Was he your dog?\n- Yeah, yeah.\n- So, you had him since\nhe was fairly young?\n- Since the very, very beginning,\ntill the very, very end.\nAnd one of the things, I\nmean, he had this kind of a,\nwe mentioned like the Roombas,\nhe had kind-hearted dumbness about him\nthat was just overwhelming,\nit's part of the reason I named him Homer,\nbecause it's after Homer Simpson,\nin case people are wondering\nwhich Homer I'm referring to.\n[Andrew laughing]\nAnd so, there's a.\nYeah, exactly.\nThere's a clumsiness\nthat was just something\nthat immediately led to a\ndeep love for each other.\nAnd one of the,\nI mean, he was always,\nit's the shared moments,\nhe was always there for\nso many a nights together,\nthat's a powerful thing about a dog\nthat he was there through\nall the loneliness,\nthrough all the tough\ntimes, through the successes\nand all those kinds of things.\nAnd I remember,\nI mean, that was a really\nmoving moment for me,\nI still miss him to this day.\n- How long ago did he die?\n- Maybe 15 years ago.\nSo, it's been awhile.\nBut it was the first time\nI've really experienced\nlike the feeling of death.\nSo, what happened, is he got a cancer.\nAnd so, he was dying slowly.\nAnd then there's a certain point\nhe couldn't get up anymore.\nNow, there's a lot of\nthings that could say here\nthat I struggle with.\nMaybe he suffered much\nlonger than he needed to,\nthat's something I\nreally think about a lot.\nBut I remember when I had\nto take him to the hospital\nand the nurses couldn't carry him, right?\nSo, you're talking about a 200 pound dog\nand I was really into\npower lifting at the time.\nAnd I remember they tried to figure out\nall these kinds of ways to.\nSo, in order to put them to sleep,\nthey had to take them into a room.\nAnd so, I had to carry him everywhere.\nAnd here's this dying friend\nof mine that I just had to,\nfirst of all, that was\nreally difficult to carry,\nsomebody that heavy when\nthey're not helping you out.\nAnd, yeah.\nSo, I remember it was the first time\nseeing a friend laying there\nand seeing life drain from his body.\nAnd that realization that\nwe're here for a short time\nwas made so real,\nthat here is friend that was\nthere for me the week before,\nthe day before, and now he's gone.\nAnd that was,\nI don't know, that spoke to the fact\nthat he could be deeply\nconnected with the dog.\nAlso spoke to the fact that\nthe shared moments together\nthat led to that deep friendship\nwill make life so amazing,\nbut it also spoke to the fact\nthat death is a motherfucker.\nSo, I know you've lost Costello recently.\n- Yeah.\n- And you can-\n- And as you're saying this,\nI'm definitely fighting back the tears.\nI thank you for sharing that.\nThat I guess we're about to both cry over,\nI don't want to say dogs [laughing]\nthat it was bound to happen\njust given when this is happening.\nYeah, it's-\n- How long did you know that\nCostello was not doing well?\n- We'll, let's see, a year\nago during the start of,\nabout six months into the pandemic,\nhe started getting\nabscesses and he was not,\nhis behavior change and\nsomething really changed.\nAnd then I put him on testosterone\nwhich helped a lot of things.\nIt certainly didn't cure everything,\nbut it helped a lot of things,\nhe was dealing with\njoint pain, sleep issues,\nand then it just became\na very slow decline\nto the point where two, three weeks ago,\nhe had a closet full of medication.\nI mean, this dog was,\nit was like a pharmacy.\nIt's amazing to me when I\nlooked at it the other day,\nI still haven't cleaned up\nand removed all those things,\n'cause I can't quite bring\nmyself to do it, but-\n- Do you think he was suffering?\n- Well, so, what happened,\nwas about a week ago,\nit was really just about\na week ago, it's amazing.\nHe was going up the\nstairs, I saw him slip.\nAnd he was a big guy,\nhe wasn't 200 pounds, but\nhe was about 90 pounds,\nhe's a bulldog, he was\npretty big and he was fit.\nAnd then I noticed\nthat he wasn't carrying a foot in the back\nlike it was injured, it\nhad no feeling at all.\nHe never liked me to touch\nhis hind paws, and I could do,\nthat thing was just flopping there.\nAnd then the vet found\nsome spinal degeneration\nand I was told that the next one would go.\nDid he suffer?\nSure, hope not, but something\nchanged in his eyes.\n- Yeah.\n- Yeah, it's the eyes again,\nI know you and I spend\nlong hours on the phone\nand tell you about like the eyes\nand what they convey and what they mean\nabout internal states\nand for sake of robots and\nbiology of other kinds, but-\n- You think something about\nhim was gone in his eyes?\n- I think he was real,\nhere, I am anthropomorphizing,\nI think he was realizing that\none of his great joys in life,\nwhich was to walk and\nsniff and pee on things.\n[Lex laughing]\nThis dog.\n- The fundamental.\n- Loved to pee on things,\nit was amazing.\nI've wondered where he put it,\nhe was like a reservoir of\nurine, it was incredible.\nI think, oh, that's Eddie,\nhe'd put like one drop on\nthe 50 millionth plant.\nAnd then we get to the 50\nmillionth in one plant,\nand he just have, leave a puddle.\nAnd here I am talking\nabout Costello peeing.\nHe was losing that ability\nto stand up and do that,\nhe was falling down\nwhile he was doing that.\nAnd I do think he started to realize.\nAnd the passage was easy and peaceful,\nbut I'll say this, I'm\nnot ashamed to say it,\nI mean, I wake up every\nmorning since then just,\nI don't even make the conscious decision\nto allow my self to cry, I wake up crying.\nAnd I'm unfortunately able\nto make it through the day,\nthanks to the great support of my friends\nand you and my family,\nbut I miss him, man.\n- You miss him?\n- Yeah, I miss him.\nAnd I feel like, Homer, Costello,\nthe relationship to one's\ndog is so specific part.\n- So, that part of you is gone?\n- That's the hard thing.\nWhat I think is different,\nis that I made the mistake, I think.\nMoreover, I hope it was a good decision,\nbut sometimes I think I made the mistake\nof I brought Costello a\nlittle bit to the world\nthrough the podcast or posting about him,\nI anthropomorphized about him in public.\nLet's be honest, I have no\nidea what his mental life was,\nor his relationship to me.\nAnd I'm just exploring all\nthis for the first time\n'cause he was my first dog,\nbut I raised him since he was seven weeks.\n- Yeah, you got hold it together,\nI noticed the episode\nyou released on Monday,\nyou mentioned Costello.\nLike you brought them back to life for me\nfor that brief moment.\n- Yeah.\nBut he's gone.\n- That's the,\nhe's going to be gone\nfor a lot of people too.\n- Well, this is what I'm struggling with.\nI think that maybe you're\npretty good at this.\nLike, have you done this before?\n[Andrew laughing]\nThis is the challenge.\nIs that actually part of me.\nI know how to take care\nof myself pretty well.\n- Yeah.\n- Not perfectly, but pretty well.\nAnd I have good support.\nI do worry a little bit\nabout how it's going to land\nand how people will feel.\nI'm concerned about their internalization.\nSo that's something\nI'm still iterating on.\n- And you have to watch you struggle,\nwhich is fascinating.\n- Right.\nAnd I've mostly been\nshielding them from this,\nbut what would make me happiest\nis if people would internalize\nsome of Costello's best traits.\nAnd his best traits were\nthat he was incredibly tough.\nI mean, he was a,\n22-inch-neck bulldog, the whole thing.\nHe was just born that way.\nWhat was so beautiful\nis that his toughness\nhas never what he rolled forward.\nIt was just how sweet and kind he was.\nAnd so if people can take that,\nthen there's a win in there someplace, so.\n- I think there's some ways\nin which she should probably\nlive on in your podcast too.\nYou should,\nI mean, it's such a,\none of the things I loved\nabout his role in your podcast\nis that he brought so much joy to you.\nWe mentioned the robots.\n- Mm-hmm.\n- Right?\nI think that's such a powerful thing\nto bring that joy into,\nlike, allowing yourself\nto experience that joy,\nto bring that joy to others,\nto share it with others.\nThat's really powerful.\nAnd I mean, not to,\nthis is like the Russian thing,\nis [chuckles] it touched me\nwhen Lucy Kay had that moment\nthat I keep thinking about\nin this show \"Louie,\"\nor like an old man was criticizing Louis\nfor whining about breaking\nup with his girlfriend,\nand he was saying like the most\nbeautiful thing about love,\nthey made a song that's catchy\nnow that's now making me\nfeel horrible saying it,\nbut like, is the loss.\nThe loss really also is making you realize\nhow much that person,\nthat dog meant to you.\nAnd like allowing\nyourself to feel that loss\nand not run away from that\nloss is really powerful.\nAnd in some ways that's also sweet,\njust like the love was\nthe loss is also sweet\nbecause you know that\nyou felt a lot for that\nthrough your friend.\nSo I, and like continue to bring that joy.\nI think it would be\namazing to the podcast.\nI hope to do the same\nwith [laughing] robots,\nor whatever else is the\nsource of joy, right?\nAnd maybe, do you think about\none day getting another dog?\n- Yeah, in time.\nYou're hitting on all\nthe key buttons here.\nI want that to,\nwe're thinking about ways to\nkind of immortalize Costello\nin a way that's real,\nnot just creating some little\nlogo or something silly.\nCostello much like David\nGoggins is a person,\nbut Goggins also has\ngrown into kind of a verb.\nYou're going to Goggins\nthis or you're going to,\nand there's an adjective.\nLike that's extreme.\nLike it,\nI think that for me, Costello\nwas all those things.\nHe was a being, he was his own being,\nhe was a noun, a verb and an adjective.\nSo, and he had this amazing super power\nthat I wish I could get,\nwhich is this ability to get everyone else\nto do things for you\nwithout doing a thing.\n[Lex laughing]\nThe Costello effect,\nas I call it.\n- So is an idea I hope he lives on.\n- Yes.\nThank you for that.\nThis actually has been\nvery therapeutic for me,\nwhich actually brings me to a question,\nwe're friends, we're\nnot just co-scientists,\ncolleagues working on a project together\nand in the world,\nthat's somewhat similar.\n- Just two dogs.\n- Just two dogs basically.\nBut let's talk about friendship,\nbecause I think that I\ncertainly know as a scientist\nthat there are elements\nthat are very lonely\nof the scientific pursuit.\nThere are elements of many\npursuits that are lonely.\nMusic,\nMath always seem to me like they're like\nthe loneliest people.\nWho knows if that's true or not.\nAlso people work in teams.\nAnd sometimes people are surrounded\nby people interacting with\npeople and they feel very lonely.\nBut for me, and I think as well for you,\nfriendship is an incredibly strong force\nin making one feel like\ncertain things are possible\nor worth reaching for,\nmaybe even making us\ncompulsively reach for them.\nSo, when you were growing up,\nyou grew up in Russia until what age?\n- 13.\n- Okay.\nAnd then you moved\ndirectly to Philadelphia?\n- To Chicago.\n- [Andrew] Chicago.\n- And then Philadelphia,\nand San Francisco and Boston and so on.\nBut really to Chicago, that's\nwhere I went to high school.\n- Do you have siblings?\n- Older brother.\n- But most people don't know that.\n[Lex laughing]\n- Yeah, he is a very different person.\nBut somebody I definitely look up to.\nSo he's a wild man.\nHe's extrovert,\nhe was into, I mean,\nso he's also scientists, a bio engineer,\nbut he's, when we were growing up,\nhe was the person who did,\ndrank and did every drug.\nAnd, but also as the life of the party.\nAnd I just thought he was the,\nwhen your older brother, five years older,\nhe was the coolest person\nthat I was wanting to be him.\nSo for that,\nhe definitely had a big influence.\nBut I think for me in terms\nof friendship, growing up,\nI had one really close friend.\nAnd then when I came here\nI had another close friend,\nbut I'm very,\nI believe,\nI don't know if I believe,\nbut I draw a lot of strength\nfrom deep connections\nwith other people,\nand just the small number of people.\nJust a really small number of people.\nThat's when I moved to this country,\nI was really surprised how,\nlike, there were\nthese large groups of\nfriends, quote, unquote.\nBut the depth of connection\nwas not there at all\nfrom my sort of perspective.\nNow, I moved to the suburb\nof Chicago, was Naperville.\nIt's more like a middle class,\nmaybe upper middle class.\nSo it's like people that cared more\nabout material possessions\nthan deep human connection.\nSo that added to the thing.\nBut I drove more meaning\nthan almost anything else\nwas from friendship.\nEarly on I had a best friend.\nHis name was,\nhis name is Yura.\nI don't know how to say it in English.\n- How do you say in Russian?\n- Yura.\nWhat's his last name?\nDo you remember if was...\n[Lex chuckles]\n- Mikolov.\nYura Mikolov.\nSo we just spent all our time together.\nThere's also a group of friends.\nLike, I dunno, it's like eight guys.\nIn Russia growing up,\nit's like parents didn't care\nif you're coming back at certain hour.\nSo we'll spent all day, all\nnight just playing soccer,\nusually called football,\nand just talking about life\nand all those kinds of things,\neven at that young age.\nI think people in Russia\nand Soviet Union grew up much quicker.\n[Lex chuckles]\nI think the education system\nat the university level\nis world-class in the United\nStates in terms of like,\nreally creating really\nbig, powerful minds.\nAt least they used to be,\nbut I think that they aspire to that.\nBut the education system for like,\nfor younger kids in the\nSoviet Union was incredible.\nLike they did not treat us as kids.\nThe level of literature,\nTolstoy, Dostoevsky.\n- When you were a small child?\n- Yeah.\n- Amazing.\nAmazing.\n- And like the level of mathematics,\nand you're made to feel like shit\nif you're not good at mathematics.\nLike we, I think in this country,\nthere's more like,\nespecially young kids\n'cause they're so cute.\nLike they're being babied.\nWe only start to really\npush adults later in life.\nLike, so if you want to be\nthe best in the world at this,\nthen you get to be pushed.\nBut we were pushed at a young age.\nEverybody was pushed.\nAnd that brought out the best in people.\nI think it really forced\npeople to discover,\nlike discover themselves\nin the Goggin style,\nbut also discover what they're\nactually passionate about,\nwhat they're not.\n- Is this true for boys and girls?\nWere they pushed equally there?\n- Yeah.\nThey were pushed.\nYeah, they were pushed\nequally, I would say.\nThere was a,\nobviously there was more,\nnot obviously,\nbut at least from my memories,\nmore of a,\nwhat's the right way to put it?\nBut there was like gender roles,\nbut not in a negative connotation.\nIt was the red dress\nversus the suit and tie\nkind of connotation, which is like,\nthere's a,\nlike guys like lifting heavy things\nand girls like creating beautiful art,\nand, like there's-\n- A more traditional view of gender,\nmore 1950, '60s.\n- But we didn't think in terms\nof, at least at that age,\nin terms of like roles\nand then like a homemaker\nor something like that or not,\nit was more about what people care about.\nLike girls cared about this set of things,\nand guys cared about the set of things.\nI think mathematics and engineering\nwas something that guys\ncared about and sort of,\nat least my perception of that time.\nAnd then girls cared about beauty.\nSo like guys want to create machines,\ngirls want to create beautiful stuff.\n[Lex laughing]\nAnd now, of course,\nthat I don't take that forward\nin some kind of philosophy of life,\nbut it's just the way I grew\nup and the way I remember it.\nBut all, everyone worked hard.\nThe value of hard work was\ninstilled in everybody.\nAnd through that,\nI think it's a little bit of hardship.\nOf course also economically\neverybody was poor,\nespecially with the collapse\nof the Soviet Union.\nThere's poverty everywhere.\nYou didn't notice it as much,\nbut there was a,\nbecause there's not much\nmaterial possessions,\nthere was a huge value\nplaced on human connection.\nJust meeting with neighbors,\neverybody knew each other.\nWe lived in an apartment\nbuilding very different\nthan you have in the\nUnited States these days.\nEverybody knew each other.\nYou would get together,\ndrink vodka, smoke cigarettes,\nand play guitar and sing\nsad songs about life.\n- What's with the sad\nsongs in the Russian thing?\nI mean, Russians do I express\njoy from time to time.\n- Yeah, they do.\n- Certainly you do.\nBut what do you think that's about?\nIs it 'cause it's cold there?\nBut it's called other places too, right?\n- I think,\nlet's just, first of all the Soviet Union,\nthe echoes of World War II\nand the millions and millions\nand millions of people that,\ncivilians that were slaughtered,\nand also starvation is there, right?\nSo like the echoes of that,\nof the ideas, the\nliterature, the art is there.\nLike that's a grandparents,\nthat's parents, that's all there.\nSo that contributes to it,\nthat life can be absurdly\nunexplainably cruel.\nAt any moment everything can change.\nSo that's in there.\nThen I think there's an empowering aspect\nto finding beauty in suffering\nthat then everything\nelse is beautiful too.\nIt's like, if you just\nlinger or it's like,\nwhy you meditate on death?\nIs like, if you just think\nabout the worst possible case\nand find beauty in that,\nthen everything else is beautiful too.\nAnd so you write songs\nabout the dark stuff.\nAnd that's somehow helps you\ndeal with whatever comes.\nThere's a hopelessness\nto the Soviet Union that,\nlike, inflation,\nall those kinds of things\nwhere people were sold dreams\nand never delivered.\nAnd so like, there's a,\nif you don't sing songs about sad things,\nyou're going to become\ncynical about this world.\n- Mm-hmm.\nInteresting.\n- So they don't want\nto give in to cynicism.\nNow, a lot of people did, one of the,\nbut that is the battle against cynicism.\nOne of the things that\nmay be common in Russia\nis a kind of cynicism about,\nlike, if I told you the\nthing I said earlier\nabout dreaming about robots,\nit's very common for people\nto dismiss that dream,\nof saying, no, that's\nnot, that's too wild.\nLike, who else do you know that did that?\nOr you want to start a podcast?\nLike who else?\nLike nobody's making money on podcasts.\nLike, why do you want to start a podcast?\nThat kind of mindset I\nthink is quite common,\nwhich is why I would say\nentrepreneurship in Russia\nis still not very good.\nWhich to be a business,\nlike, to be an entrepreneur\nyou have to dream big,\nand you have to have others around you,\nlike friends and support\ngroup that make you dream big.\nBut if you don't give in to cynicism\nand appreciate the beauty\nin the unfairness of life,\nthe absurd unfairness of life,\nthen I think it just makes you\nappreciative of everything.\nIt's like a,\nit's a prerequisite for gratitude.\nAnd so, yeah,\nI think that instilled in me ability\nto appreciate everything,\njust like everything.\nEverything's amazing.\nAnd then also there is a culture\nof like romanticizing everything.\nLike, it's almost like\nromantic relationships\nwere very like soap opera,\nlike is very like over the top dramatic.\nAnd I think that it was\ninstilled in me too,\nnot only do I appreciate\neverything about life,\nbut I get like emotional about it.\nIn a sense, like,\nI get like a visceral feeling\nof joy for everything.\nAnd the same with friends or\npeople of the opposite sex.\nLike, there's a deep,\nlike emotional connection\nthere that like [laughing]\nthat's like way too dramatic too.\nLike, I guess relative to\nwhat the actual moment is.\nBut I derive so much deep,\nlike dramatic joy from\nso many things in life.\nAnd I think I would attributed that\nto the upbringing in Russia.\nBut the thing that sticks\nmost of all is the friendship.\nAnd have now since then had\none other friend like that\nin the United States, he lives in Chicago.\nHis name is Matt.\nAnd slowly here and there accumulating\nreally fascinating people,\nbut I'm very selective with that.\nFunny enough, the few times,\nit's not few it's a lot of times now\ninteracting with Joe Rogan [chuckles]\nit's sounds surreal to say,\nbut there was a kindred spirit there.\nLike I've connected with him.\nAnd there's been people like that\nalso in the grappling sports\nthat are really connected with.\nI've actually struggled,\nwhich is why I'm so\nglad to be your friend,\nis I've struggled to\nconnect with scientists.\n- They can be a little\nbit wooden sometimes.\n- [Lex] Yeah.\n- Even the biologist.\nI mean, one thing that I,\nwell, I'm so struck by the\nfact that you work with robots,\nyou're an engineer, AI,\nscience technology,\nand that all sounds like hardware, right?\nBut what you're describing\nand I know is true about you\nis this deep emotional\nlife and this resonance\nand it's really wonderful.\nI actually think it's one of\nthe reasons why so many people,\nscientists and otherwise\nhave gravitated towards you\nand your podcast is because\nyou hold both elements.\nIn the Hermann Hesse's book,\nI don't know if you, \"Narcissus\nand Goldmund,\" right?\nIt's about these elements\nof the logical rational mind\nand the emotional mind and\nhow those are woven together.\nAnd if people haven't\nread it, they should,\nand you embody the full picture.\nAnd I think that's so much\nof what draws people to you.\n- I've read every Hermann\nHesse book by the way.\n- As usual [chuckles]\nas usual I've done about\n9% of what life is.\nNo, it's true.\nYou mentioned Joe,\nwho is a phenomenal human being,\nnot just for his amazing accomplishments,\nbut for how he shows up\nto the world one on one.\nI think I heard him say the\nother day on an interview,\nhe said, there is no public\nor private version of him.\nAnd he's like, this is me.\nHe said that it was beautiful.\nHe said, I'm like the fish\nthat got through the net.\nAnd there is no onstage offstage version.\nAnd you're absolutely right.\nAnd I.\n- Fish.\n[Lex laughing]\n- So, but, well, you guys,\nI have a question actually about-\n- But that's a really good point\nabout public and private life.\nHe was a huge,\nif I could just comment real quick.\nLike that, he was a,\nI've been a fan of Joe for a long time,\nbut he's been an inspiration\nto not have any difference\nbetween public and private life.\nI actually had a conversation\nwith Naval about this,\nand he said that you\ncan't have a rich life,\nlike exciting life\nif you're the same person\npublicly and privately.\nAnd I think I understand that idea,\nbut I don't agree with it.\nI think that's really\nfulfilling and exciting\nto be the same person\nprivately and publicly\nwith very few exceptions.\nNow that said, I don't have\nany really strange sex kinks.\nSo like,\nI feel like it can be open\nwith basically everything.\nI don't have anything I'm ashamed of.\nThere's some things that\ncould be perceived poorly,\nlike the screaming Roombas,\nbut I'm not ashamed of them.\nI just have to present\nthem in the right context.\nBut there's a freedom to being\nthe same person in private\nas in public.\nAnd that Joe made me realize\nthat you can be that.\nAnd also to be kind to others.\nIt sounds kind of absurd,\nbut I really always enjoyed\nlike being good to others.\nLike just being kind towards others.\nBut I always felt like the\nworld didn't want me to be.\nLike, there's so much negativity\nwhen I was growing up,\nlike just around people.\nIf you actually just\nnotice how people talk,\nthey, from like, complaining\nabout the weather,\nthis could be just like the big cities\nthat I've visited.\nBut there's a general negativity,\nand positivity is kind of suppressed.\nYou're not,\none, you're not seen as very intelligent,\nand two, there's a kind of,\nyou're seen as like a\nlittle bit of a weirdo.\nAnd so I always felt\nlike I had to hide that.\nAnd what Joe made me realize,\none, I could be fully\njust the same person private and public,\nand two, I can embrace being kind,\nin just, in the way that I like,\nin the way I know how to do.\nAnd sort of for me on like,\non Twitter or like publicly,\nwhenever I say stuff,\nthat means saying stuff simply\nalmost to the point of cliche.\nAnd like, I have the\nstrength now to say it,\neven if I'm being mocked.\n[Lex laughing]\nYou know what I mean?\nLike, just it's okay.\nIf everything's going to be okay.\nOkay, some people will think you're dumb.\nThey're probably right.\nThe point is,\nlike, just enjoy being yourself.\nAnd that Joe, more than\nalmost anybody else,\nbecause he's so successful at\nit, inspired me to do that.\nBe kind and be the same\nperson, private and public.\n- I love it.\nAnd I love the idea that authenticity\ndoesn't have to be oversharing, right?\nThat it doesn't mean you reveal\nevery detail of your life.\nIt's a way of being true\nto an essence of oneself.\n- Right.\nThere's never a feeling when\nyou deeply think and introspect\nthat you're hiding\nsomething from the world\nor you're being dishonest\nin some fundamental way.\nSo, yeah, that's truly liberating.\nIt allows you to think,\nit allows you to like think freely,\nto speak freely,\nto just to be freely.\nThat said,\nit's not like there's not\nstill a responsibility\nto be the best version of yourself.\nSo, I'm very careful with\nthe way I say something.\nSo, the whole point,\nit's not so simple to express the spirit\nthat's inside you with words.\nI mean, some people are\nmuch better than others.\nI struggle.\nLike oftentimes when I say something\nand I hear myself say it,\nit sounds really dumb and\nnot at all what I meant.\nSo that's the responsibility you have.\nIt's not just like being\nthe same person publicly and privately\nmeans you can just say whatever the hell.\nIt means there's still\nresponsibility to try to be,\nto express who you truly are.\nAnd that's hard.\n[Lex chuckles]\n- It hard.\nAnd I think that,\nwe have this pressure,\nall people, when I say\nwe, I mean all humans,\nand maybe robots too,\nfeel this pressure to be\nable to express ourselves\nin that one moment in that one form.\nAnd it is beautiful when\nsomebody, for instance,\ncan capture some essence\nof love or sadness or anger\nor something in a song or in\na poem or in a short quote,\nbut perhaps it's also possible\nto do it in aggregate,\nall the things how you show up.\nFor instance, one of the\nthings that initially drew me\nto want to get to know you as\na human being and a scientist\nand eventually we became friends,\nwas the level of respect\nthat you brought to your podcast listeners\nby wearing a suit.\n- Yeah.\n- I'm being serious here.\nI was raised thinking that if\nyou overdress a little bit,\noverdressed by American,\ncertainly by American standards,\nyou're overdressed for a podcast,\nbut it's genuine.\nYou're not doing it for any reason,\nexcept I have to assume,\nand I assumed at the time,\nthat it was because you have\na respect for your audience,\nyou respect them enough to\nshow up a certain way for them.\nIt's for you also, but it's for them.\n- Yeah.\n- And I think between that\nand your commitment to your friendship,\njust the way that you talk\nabout friendships and love\nand the way you hold\nup these higher ideals,\nI think at least as a\nconsumer of your content\nand as your friend,\nwhat I find, is that in aggregate,\nyou're communicating who you are,\nit doesn't have to be\none quote or something.\nAnd I think that we're sort of obsessed\nby like the one Einstein quote,\nor the one line of poetry or something,\nbut I think you so embody the\nway that, and Joe as well,\nit's about how you live your life\nand how you show up as\na collection of things\nand said and done.\n- Yeah, that that's,\nand so, the aggregate is\nthe goal, the tricky thing,\nand Jordan Peterson talks about this\nbecause he's under attack\nway more than you and I will ever be, but-\n- Right now?\n- For now, right?\nThis is very true for now.\nThat the people who\nattack on the internet,\nthis is one of the problems with Twitter,\nis they don't consider the aggregate,\nthey take a single statements.\nAnd so, one of the defense mechanisms,\nlike again why Joe has\nbeen an inspiration,\nis that when you in\naggregate, a good person,\na lot of people will know that.\nAnd so, that makes you much more immune\nto the attacks of people\nthat bring out an individual statement\nthat might be a misstatement of some kind,\nor doesn't express who you are.\nAnd so, that, I like that\nidea is the aggregate.\nAnd the power of the podcast,\nis you have hundreds of hours out there,\nand being yourself and people\nget to know who you are.\nAnd once they do,\nand you post pictures of screaming Roombas\nas you kick them,\nthey will understand\nthat you don't mean well.\nBy the way, as a side comment,\nI don't know if I want to release this\nbecause it's not just the Roombas-\n- You have a whole dungeon of robots.\n- Okay.\nSo, this is a problem,\nthe Boston Dynamics came\nup against this problem.\nBut, let me work this out like\nworkshop this out with you,\nand maybe because we'll post\nthis, people will let me know.\nSo, there's legged robots,\nthey look like a dog,\nI'm trying to create a very\nreal human-robot connection,\nbut like they're also incredible\nbecause you can throw them\nlike off of a building\nand they'll land fine.\nAnd this beautiful.\n- That's amazing.\nI've seen the Instagram videos\nof like cats jumping off of\nlike fifth story buildings\nand then walking away.\nBut no one should throw their cat\nout of a window of a building.\n- Well, this is the\nproblem I'm experiencing,\nall certainly kicking the robots,\nits really fascinating how\nthey recover from those kicks.\nBut like just seeing myself do it\nand also seeing others do it,\nit just does not look good,\nand I don't know what to do with that.\n'Cause it's such a-\n- Ill 'do it.\n[Lex laughing]\n- See.\nBut you don't,\n'cause you are-\n- A robot, no, I'm kidding.\nWhat's interesting?\n- Yeah.\n- Before today's conversation,\nI probably could do it,\nand I'm thinking about robots,\nbills of rights and things.\nNot to satisfy you or to satisfy anything,\nexcept that if they have\nsome sentience aspect\nto their being, then I\nwould load to kick it.\n- I don't think we'd be able to kick it,\nyou might be able to kick the first time,\nbut not the second, this is\nthe problem of experience.\nOne of the cool things,\nis one of the robots I'm working with,\nyou can pick it up by\none leg and is dangling,\nand you can throw it in any kind of way\nand it'll land correctly.\nSo, it's really-\n- I had a friend who had a cat like that.\n[Lex laughing]\n- Oh man, we look forward\nto the letters on the cat-\n- Oh no, I'm not\nsuggesting anyone did that,\nbut he had this cat,\nand the cat, he would\njust throw it onto the bed\nfrom across the room, and then\nit would run back for more,\nor somehow that was the\nnature of the relationship.\nI think no one should\ndo that to an animal,\nbut this cat seemed to\nreturn for whatever reason.\n- But a robot is a robot,\nand it's fascinating to me how\nhard it is for me to do that.\nSo, it's unfortunate,\nbut I don't think I\ncan do that to a robot.\nLike I struggle with that.\nSo, for me to be able\nto do that with a robot,\nI have to almost get like into the state\nthat I imagine like doctors get into\nwhen they're doing surgery,\nlike I have to do what\nrobotics colleagues of mine do,\nwhich is like start\nseeing it as an object.\n- Dissociate.\n- Like dissociate.\nSo, it was just fascinating\nthat I have to do that in\nto do that with a robot.\nI just want to take that\nlittle bit of a tangent.\n- No, I think it's an important thing.\nI mean, I'm not shy about\nthe fact that for many years\nI've worked on experimental animals,\nand that's been a very challenging aspect\nof being a biologist.\nMostly mice, but in the past no longer,\nthank goodness 'cause I\njust don't like doing it,\nlarger animals as well.\nAnd now I work on humans,\nwhich I can give consent, verbal consent.\nSo, I think that it's extremely important\nto have an understanding\nof what the guidelines are\nand where one's own\nboundaries are around this.\nIt's not just an important question,\nit might be the most important question\nbefore any work can progress.\n- So, you asked me about friendship.\nI know you have a lot of\nthoughts about friendship,\nwhat do you think is the\nvalue of friendship in life?\n- Well, for me personally,\njust because of my life\ntrajectory and arc friendship,\nand I should say,\nI do have some female friends\nthat are just friends,\nthey're completely platonic relationships,\nbut it's been mostly male\nfriendship to me, has been-\n- It has been all male\nfriendships to me actually, yeah.\n- Interesting.\n- Yeah.\n- It's been an absolute lifeline.\nThey are my family,\nI have a biological family\nand I have great respect and love for them\nand an appreciation for them,\nbut it's provided me the,\nI won't even say confidence\nbecause there's always an\nanxiety in taking any good risk,\nor any risk worth taking.\nIt's given me the sense that\nI should go for certain things\nand try certain things to take\nrisk to weather that anxiety.\nAnd I don't consider myself\na particularly competitive person,\nbut I would sooner die than disappoint,\nor let down one of my friends.\nI can think of nothing worse actually,\nthan disappointing one of my friends,\neverything else is secondary to me.\n- What disappointment?\n- Disappoint, meaning not,\nI mean, certainly I strive\nalways to show up as best I can\nfor the friendship, and\nthat can be in small ways.\nThat can mean making\nsure the phone is away,\nsometimes it's about,\nI'm terrible with punctuality\n'cause I'm an academic.\nAnd so, I just get lost in\ntime and I don't mean anything,\nbut it's striving to, to listen to,\nto enjoy good times and to make time.\nIt kind of goes back to this\nfirst variable we talked about,\nto make sure that I spend time\nand to get time in person and check in.\nAnd I think there's so many ways\nin which friendship is vital to me,\nit's it's actually to me,\nwhat makes life worth living.\n- Yeah.\nWell, there's a,\nI am surprised like with\nthe high school friends\nhow we don't actually\ntalk that often these days\nin terms of time,\nbut every time we see each other,\nit's immediately right\nback to where we started.\nSo, I struggled that how much\ntime you really allocate,\nfor the friendship to be deeply meaningful\nbecause they're always there with me\neven if we don't talk often.\nSo, there's a kind of loyalty.\nI think maybe it's a different style,\nbut I think to me,\nfriendship is being there\nin the hard times, I think.\nLike I'm much more reliable\nwhen you're going through shit\nthan in like-\n- You're pretty reliable anyway.\n- No, but if you're like a\nwedding or something like that,\nor like, I don't know, like\nyou want an award of some kind,\nyeah, I'll congratulate\nthe shit out of you,\nbut like that's not, and I'll be there,\nbut that's not as important\nto me as being there\nwhen like nobody else\nis like just being there\nwhen shit hits the fan,\nor something's tough\nwhere the world turns their back on you,\nall those kinds of things,\nthat, to me, that's where\nfriendship is meaningful.\n- Well, I know that to be true about you\nand that's a felt thing\nand a real thing with you.\nLet me ask one more thing\nabout that actually,\nbecause I'm not a practitioner Jujitsu,\nI know you are, Joe is,\nbut years ago, I read a\nbook that I really enjoyed,\nwhich is Sam Sheridan's\nbook, \" A Fighter's Heart,\"\nhe talks about all these\ndifferent forms of martial arts.\nAnd maybe it was in the book,\nmaybe it was in an interview,\nbut he said that fighting,\nor being in physical battle with somebody,\nJujitsu boxing or some other form\nof direct physical contact\nbetween two individuals\ncreates this bond unlike any other.\nBecause he said it's\nlike a one night stand,\nyou're sharing bodily fluids\nwith somebody that you barely know.\n- Yeah.\n- And I chuckled about it\n'cause it's kind of funny\nand it kind of tongue in cheek.\nBut at the same time,\nI think this is a fundamental way\nin which members of a species bond\nis through physical contact.\nAnd certainly, there are other forms,\nthere's cuddling, and\nthere's hand holding,\nand there's in their sexual intercourse,\nand there's all sorts of things.\n- What's cuddling?\nI haven't heard of it.\n- I heard this recently,\nI didn't know this term,\nbut there's a term,\nthey've turned the noun\ncupcake into a verb,\ncupcaking it turns out, I\njust learned about this.\nCupcaking is when you\nspend time just cuddling.\nI didn't know about this.\nYou heard it here first,\nalthough I heard it\nfirst just the other day.\nCupcaking is actually a-\n- Cuddling is everything,\nit's not just like,\nis it in bed, or is it in the coach?\nLike what's cuddling?\nI do look up what cuddling is-\n- We need to look at this up\nand we need to define the variables.\nI think it definitely has to do\nwith physical contact, I'm told,\nbut in terms of battle, a competition,\nand the Sheridan quote, I'm just curious.\nSo, do you get close, or\nfeel a bond with people that,\nfor instance, you rolled Jujitsu with,\nor even though you don't know\nanything else about them,\nwas he right about this?\n- Yeah, I mean on many levels.\nHe also has the book, what?\n\"A Fighter's Mind.\"\n- Yeah, that was the third one.\nHe's actually an excellent writer.\nWhat's interesting about him,\njust briefly about Sheridan,\nI don't know him, but I did\na little bit of research,\nhe went to Harvard, he was\nan art major at Harvard,\nhe claims all he did was\nsmoke cigarettes and do art.\nI don't know if his art was any good.\nAnd I think his father\nwas in the SEAL teams.\nAnd then when he got out\nof Harvard, graduated,\nhe took off around the world\nlearning all the forms of martial arts,\nand was early to the\nkind of ultimate fighting\nkind of mixed martial arts and things.\nGreat book.\nYeah, yeah.\n- It's amazing.\nI don't actually remember\nit, but I read it,\nand I remember thinking that\nwas an amazing encapsulation\nof what makes fighting like the art,\nlike what makes it compelling.\nI would say that there's so many ways\nthat Jujitsu grappling, wrestling,\ncombat sports in general,\nis like one of the most\nintimate things you could do.\nI don't know if I would describe\nin terms of bodily liquids\nand all those kinds of things.\n- I think he was more or less joking.\n- I think there's a few\nways that it does that.\nSo, one, because you're\nso vulnerable [sighs]\nSo, the honesty of stepping on the mat\nand often all of us have ego\nthinking we're better than we\nare at this particular art.\nAnd then the honesty of being submitted,\nor being worse than you thought you are\nand just sitting with that knowledge,\nthat kind of honesty,\nwe don't get to experience\nit in most of daily life.\nWe can continue living\nsomewhat of an illusion of\nour conceptions of ourselves\n'cause people are not going\nto hit us with the reality,\nthe mat speaks only the truth,\nthe reality just hits you.\nAnd that vulnerability\nis the same as like the\nloss of a loved one,\nthough it's the loss of a\nreality that you knew before,\nyou now have to deal\nwith this new reality.\nAnd when you're sitting\nthere in that vulnerability,\nand there's these other people\nthat are also sitting\nin that vulnerability,\nyou get to really connect like, fuck,\nlike I'm not as special\nas I thought I was,\nand life is like not, life is\nharsher than I thought I was,\nand we're just sitting\nthere with that reality,\nsome of us can put words\nto them, some we can't.\nSo, I think that definitely,\nis a thing that at least the intimacy.\nThe other thing is the human contact.\nThere's something about,\nI mean, like a big hug,\nlike during COVID,\nvery few people hugged\nme and I hugged them,\nand I always felt good when they did.\nLike we were all tested,\nand especially now we're vaccinated,\nbut there's still people,\nthis is true of San Francisco's,\nit's true in Boston,\nthey want to keep, not only six feet away,\nbut stay at home and never touch you.\nThat loss of basic humanity\nis the opposite of what I feel in Jujitsu,\nwhere it was like that\ncontact where you're like,\nI don't give a shit\nabout whatever rules we're\nsupposed to have in society\nwhere you have to keep a distance\nand all that kind of stuff.\nJust the hug,\nlike the intimacy of a hug,\nthat's like a good bear hug,\nand you're like just\ncontrolling another person,\nand also there is some\nkind of love communicated\nthrough just trying to\nbreak each other's arms.\nI don't exactly understand\nwhy violence is the such\na close neighbor to love,\nbut it is.\n- Well, in the hypothalamus,\nthe neurons that control sexual behavior,\nbut also non-sexual contact,\nare not just nearby the neurons\nthat control aggression and fighting,\nthey are salt and pepper\nwith those neurons.\nIt's a very interesting,\nand it almost sounds\nkind of risky and controversial and stuff,\nI'm not anthropomorphizing\nabout what this means,\nbut in the brain, those\nstructures are interdigitated,\nyou can't separate them\nexcept at a very fine level.\nAnd here, the way you describe it,\nis the same as a real thing.\n- I do want to make an\ninteresting comment.\nAgain, these are the things\nthat could be taken out of context,\nbut one of the amazing\nthings about Jujitsu,\nis both guys and girls train it.\nAnd I was surprised.\nSo, like I'm a big fan\nof yoga pants [giggles]\nat the gym kind of thing.\nIt reveals the beauty of the female form.\nBut the thing is,\nlike girls are dressed\nin skintight clothes\nin Jujitsu often.\nAnd I found myself not at all,\nthinking like that at all\nwhen training with girls.\n- Well, the context is very non-sexual.\n- But I was surprised to learn that.\nWhen I first started to Jujitsu,\nI thought, wouldn't that be kind of weird\nto train with the opposites\nthat in something so intimate.\n- So, boys and girls, men and women,\nthey roll Jujitsu together?\n- Completely.\n- Interesting.\n- And the only times girls kind\nof try to stay away from guys,\nI mean, there's two contexts,\nof course, there's always going\nto be creeps in this world.\nSo, everyone knows who\nkind of stay away from,\nand the other is there's a size disparity.\nSo, girls will often\ntry to roll with people\na little bit closer weight-wise,\nBut no, that's one of the things\nthat are empowering to women,\nthat's what they fall in love with\nwhen they started doing Jujitsu,\nis first of all,\nthey gain an awareness and\na pride over their body,\nwhich is great.\nAnd then second, they get to [chuckles]\nespecially later on,\nstart submitting big dudes\nlike these bros that come in\nwho are all shredded and like muscular,\nand they get to technique to\nexercise dominance over them,\nand that's a powerful feeling.\n- You've seen women force\na larger guy to tap her,\nor even choke them up.\n- Well, I was deadlifting like a four,\noh boy, I think it's 495.\nSo, I was really into power-lifting\nwhen I started at Jujitsu,\nand I remember being submitted by,\nI thought I walked in\nfeeling like I'm going to be,\nif not the greatest fighter\never, at least top three.\nAnd so, as a white belt,\nyou roll in like all happy.\nAnd then you realize\nthat as long as you're not\napplying too much force,\nthat you're having,\nI remember being submitted many times\nby like 130, 120-pound girls\nat our Balance Studios in Philadelphia,\nthat a lot of incredible\nfemale Jujitsu players.\nAnd that's really humbling too\nthat technique can overpower\nin combat pure strength.\nAnd that's the other thing,\nthere is something about\ncombat that's primal.\nLike there, it just feels,\nit feels like we were born to do this.\nLike that-\n- We have circuits in our brain\nthat are dedicated to\nthis kind of interaction.\nThere's no question.\n- And that's what it felt like,\nit wasn't that I'm learning a new skill.\nIt was like,\nsomehow I am a remembering echoes\nof something I've learned in the past.\n- Well, it's like hitting puberty.\nA child before puberty has no concept\nof boys and girls having this attraction,\nregardless of whether\nor not they're attracted\nto boys or girl, doesn't matter.\nAt some point, most people, not all,\nbut certainly, but most\npeople, when they hit puberty,\nsuddenly people appear differently,\nand certain people take on a\nromantic or sexual interest\nfor the very first time.\n- Yeah.\n- And so it's like,\nit's revealing a circuitry in the brain.\nIt's not like they learn that it's innate.\nAnd I think it,\nwhen I hear the way you describe Jujitsu\nand enrolling Jujitsu,\nit reminds me a little bit,\nJoe was telling me recently\nabout the first time he went hunting\nand he felt like it revealed a circuit\nthat was in him all along,\nbut he hadn't experienced before.\n- Yeah.\nThat's definitely there.\nAnd of course, there's\nthe physical activity.\nOne of the interesting\nthings about Jujitsu\nis it's one of the really\nstrenuous exercises\nthat you can do late into your adult life,\nlike into your 50, 60, 70s, 80s.\nWhen I came up,\nthere's a few people in\ntheir 80s that were training.\nAnd as long as you're smart,\nas long as you practice techniques\nand pick your partners correctly,\nyou can do that kind of art.\nThat's late into life.\nAnd so you're getting exercise.\nThere's not many activities I find\nthat are amenable to that.\nSo, because it's such a thinking game,\nthe Jujitsu in particular is an art\nor technique pays off a lot.\nSo you can still maintain,\nfirst of all, remain injury\nfree if you use good technique,\nand also through good\ntechnique be able to go,\nbe active with people that\nare much, much younger.\nAnd so that was, to me,\nthat and running are the two activities\nyou can kind of do late in life.\nBecause to me a healthy life\nhas exercises as the piece of the puzzle.\n- No, absolutely.\nAnd I'm glad that we're\non the physical component,\nbecause I know that there's for you,\nyou've talked before about the crossover\nbetween the physical and the\nintellectual and the mental.\nAre you still running at\nridiculous hours of the night\nfor ridiculously long?\n- Yeah, so, definitely.\nI've been running late\nat night here in Austin.\nPeople tell,\nthe area we're in now,\npeople say it's a dangerous area,\nwhich I find laughable coming\nfrom the bigger cities.\nNo, I run late at night.\nThere's something.\n- If you see a guy running\nthrough Austin at 2:00 a.m.\nin a suit and tie, it's probably.\n[Lex laughing]\n- Well, yeah.\nI mean, I do think about that\n'cause I get recognized\nmore and more in Austin.\nI worry that,\nbut not really,\nthat I get recognized late at night.\nBut there is something about the night\nthat brings out those deep\nphilosophical thoughts\nand self-reflection, that really enjoy.\nBut recently I started\ngetting back to the grind.\nSo I'm going to be competing\nor hoping to be compete\nin September and October.\n- In Jujitsu?\n- In Jujitsu, yeah.\nTo get back to competition.\nAnd so that requires getting\nback into a great cardio shape.\nI've been getting,\nrunning as part of my daily routine.\n- Got it.\n- [Lex] Yeah.\n- Well, I always know I can reach you\nregardless of time zone in\nthe middle of the night,\nwherever that happens.\n- Well, part of that has\nto be just being single\nand being a programmer.\nThose two things just don't work well\nin terms of a steady sleep schedule.\n- It's not bankers hours kind of work.\nNine to five.\nI want to, you mentioned single.\nI want to ask you a little bit\nabout the other form of relationship,\nwhich is romantic love.\nSo, your parents are still married?\n- Still married,\nstill happily married.\n- That's impressive.\n- [Lex] Yeah.\n- A rare thing nowadays.\n- [Lex] Yeah.\n- So you grew up with that example?\n- Yeah.\nI guess that's a powerful thing, right?\nIf there's an example\nthat I think can work.\n- Yeah.\nI didn't have that in my own family,\nbut when I see it,\nit's inspiring and it's beautiful.\nThe fact that they have that,\nand that was the norm for you,\nI think is really wonderful.\n- Well, it was a,\nin the case of my parents\nit was interesting to watch\n'cause there's obviously tension.\nLike, there'll be times where they fought\nand all those kinds of things.\nThey obviously get frustrated\nwith each other and they like,\nbut they find mechanisms\nhow to communicate that to each other,\nlike to make fun of\neach other a little bit,\nlike to tease, to get some\nof that frustration out,\nand then ultimately to reunite\nand find their joyful moments\nand be that the energy.\nI think it's clear\n'cause I got together in\nthere I think early 20s,\nlike very, very young.\nI think you grow together as people.\n- Yeah.\nYou're still in the critical\nperiod of brain plasticity.\n[laughing]\n- And also, I mean,\nit's just like divorce was so frowned upon\nthat you stick it out.\nAnd I think a lot of couples\nespecially from that time,\nthe Soviet Union,\nthat's probably applies\nto a lot of cultures.\nYou stick it out and you put in the work,\nyou learn how to put in the work.\nAnd once you do,\nyou start to get to\nsome of those rewarding aspects of being,\nlike through time has sharing\nso many moments together.\nThat's definitely something\nthat was an inspiration to me,\nbut maybe that's where I have.\nSo I have a similar kind of longing\nto have a lifelong partner,\nlike to have that kind of view,\nwhere same with friendship,\nlifelong friendship is\nthe most meaningful kind.\nThat there is something with that time\nof sharing all that time together.\nLike till death do us\npart is a powerful thing.\nNot by force,\nnot because of the religion said it\nor the government said it\nor your culture said it,\nbut because you want to.\n- Do you want children?\n- Definitely, yeah.\nDefinitely want children.\nIt's-\n- How many Roombas do you have?\n- Oh, I thought-\n- You should, no, no-\n- Human children?\n- No, human to human children.\n- 'Cause I already have the children.\n- Exactly.\nWhat I was saying,\nyou probably need to at\nleast as many human children\nas you do Roombas.\nBig family, small family.\n- So.\n- In your mind's eyes,\nthey're a bunch of\nFridman's running around.\n- So I'll tell you, like realistically,\nI can explain exactly my thinking,\nand this is similar to\nthe robotics work is,\nif I'm like purely logical right now,\nmy answer would be I don't want kids.\nBecause I just don't have enough time.\nI have so much going on.\nBut when I'm using the\nsame kind of vision I use\nfor the robots\nis I know my life will be\ntransformed with the first.\nLike I know I would love being a father.\nAnd so the question of how many,\nthat's on the other side of that hill.\nIt could be some ridiculous number.\nSo I just know that-\n- I have a feeling and I could be,\nI don't have a crystal\nball, but I don't know.\nI see an upwards of,\ncertainly three or more\ncome comes to mind.\n- So much of that has to do\nwith the partner you're with too.\nSo like that, that's\nsuch an open question,\nespecially in this society of\nwhat the right partnership is.\n'Cause I'm deeply empathetic.\nI want to see, like to me,\nwhat I look for in your relationship\nis for me to be really excited\nabout the passions of another person,\nlike whatever they're into,\nit doesn't have to be a career success.\nAny kind of success,\njust to be excited for them,\nand for them to be excited for me.\nAnd like share in that\nexcitement and build,\nand build and build.\nBut there was also\npractical aspects of like,\nwhat kind of shit do you\nenjoy doing together?\nAnd I think family is a\nreal serious undertaking.\n- It certainly is.\nI mean, I think that I\nhave a friend who said it,\nI think best,\nwhich is that you first have,\nhe's in a very successful relationship\nand has a family.\nAnd he said,\nyou first have to define the role\nand then you have to cast the\nright person for the role.\n[Lex laughing]\n- Well, yeah, there's\nsome deep aspects of that,\nbut there's also an aspect to\nwhich you're not smart enough\nfrom this side of it to define the role.\nI think there's part of\nit that has to be a leap\nthat you have to take.\nAnd I see having kids that way.\nYou just have to go with\nit and figure it out also.\nAs long as there's love there,\nlike what the hell is life for even?\nSo I've,\nthere's so many incredibly\nsuccessful people that I know\nthat I've gotten to\nknow that all have kids.\nAnd the presence of kids for the most part\nhas only been something\nthat energizes them,\nsomething they gave them meaning,\nsomething that made them the\nbest version of themselves,\nlike made them more productive, not less,\nwhich is fascinating to me.\n- It is fascinating.\nI mean, you can imagine\nif the way that you felt about Homer,\nthe way that I feel\nand felt about Costello\nis at all a glimpse of what\nthat must be like then.\n- Exactly.\nThe downside,\nthe thing I worry more about\nis the partner side of that.\nI've seen,\nthe kids are almost universally\na source of increased productivity\nand joy and happiness.\nLike, yeah, they're a pain in the ass.\nYeah, is complicated.\nYeah, so and so forth, people\nlike to complain about kids.\nBut then when you actually look past\nthat little shallow layer of\ncomplaint, kids are great.\nThe source of pain for a lot of people\nis if when the relationship doesn't work.\nAnd so I'm very kind of\nconcerned about like,\ndating is very difficult,\nand I'm a complicated person.\nAnd so it's been very difficult\nto find the right kind of person.\nBut that statement doesn't even make sense\nbecause I'm not on dating\napps, I don't see people.\nYou're like the first\nperson I saw in awhile.\nIt's like you and Michael\nMalice and like Joe.\nSo, like, I don't think\nI've seen like a female.\nWhat is it?\nAn element of the female\nspecies in quite a while.\nSo, I think you have to\nput yourself out there.\nWhat is it?\nDaniel Johnston says,\ntrue love will find you,\nbut only if you're looking.\nSo there's some element\nof really taking the leap\nand putting yourself out there\nin kind of different situations.\nAnd I don't know how to do that\nwhen you're behind a\ncomputer all the time.\n- Well, you're a builder\nand you're a problem solver,\nand you find solutions,\nand I'm confident the\nsolution is out there, and.\n- I think you're implying\nthat I'm going to build the\ngirlfriend, which I think.\n- Well, and maybe we shouldn't\nseparate this friendship,\nthe notion of friendship and community,\nand if we go back to this\nconcept of the aggregate,\nmaybe you'll meet this\nwoman through a friend,\nor maybe you'll or something of that sort.\n- So, one of the things,\nI dunno if you feel the same way,\nI definitely one of those\npeople that just falls in love\nand that's it.\n- Yeah, I can't say I'm like that.\nWith Costello it was instantaneous.\n- Yeah.\n- It really was.\nI mean, I know it's not romantic love,\nbut it was instantaneous.\nNo, I, but that's me.\nAnd I think that if you know, you know,\nbecause that's a good\nthing that you have there.\n- It's, I'm very careful with that,\nbecause you don't want to fall\nin love with the wrong person.\nSo I try to be very kind of careful with,\nI've noticed this because\nI fall in love with every,\nlike this mug,\neverything I fall in love\nwith things in this world.\nSo, like, you have to be really careful\nbecause a girl comes up to you and says\nshe loves DUSTY HUSKY,\nthat doesn't necessarily\nmean to marry her tonight.\n- Yes.\nAnd I like the way you said that out loud\nso that you heard it,\nyou doesn't mean you need\nto marry her tonight, right?\n- [Lex] Exactly.\n- [Andrew] Right.\n- But I mean, but people are amazing,\nand people are beautiful and that's,\nso I'm fully embraced that,\nbut also you have to be\ncareful with relationships.\nAnd at the same time,\nlike I mentioned to you offline, I don't,\nthere's something about me\nthat appreciates swinging for\nthe fences and not dating,\nlike doing serial\ndating, or dating around.\n- Like you're a one guy,\none girl kind of guy.\n- [Lex] Yeah.\n- And you said that.\n- And it's tricky\nbecause you want to be careful\nwith that kind of stuff.\nEspecially now there's a growing platform\nthat have a ridiculous\namount of female interests\nof a certain kind.\nBut I'm looking for deep connection,\nand I'm looking by sending home alone,\nand every once in a while\ntalking to Stanford professors.\n- Perfect solution.\n- On a podcast.\n- Perfect solution.\n- Is going to workout great.\n- It's well,\nit's part of,\nthat constitutes machine\nlearning of sorts.\n- Yeah, of sorts.\n- I do,\nyou mentioned what has now\nbecome a quite extensive\nand expansive public\nplatform, which is incredible.\nI mean, the number of people out,\nfirst time I saw your podcast,\nI noticed the suit,\nI was like, he respects his\naudience, which was great,\nbut I also thought this is amazing.\nPeople are showing up for\nscience and engineering\nand technology information\nand those discussions\nand other sorts of discussions.\nNow, I do want to talk for\na moment about the podcast.\nSo my two questions about the podcast are,\nwhen you started it, did you have a plan?\nAnd regardless of what that answer is,\ndo you know where you're taking it,\nor would you like to leave us?\nI do believe in an element\nof surprise is always fun.\nBut what about the podcast?\nDo you enjoy the podcast?\nI mean, your audience\ncertainly includes me,\nreally enjoys the podcast.\nIt's incredible.\n- So I love talking to people,\nand there's something about microphones\nthat really bring out the best in people.\nLike you don't get a\nchance to talk like this.\nIf you and I were just hanging out,\nwe would have a very\ndifferent conversation\nin the amount of focus we\nallocate to each other.\nWe would be having fun\ntalking about other stuff\nand doing other things.\nThere'll be a lot of distraction.\nThere would be some phone use\nand all that kind of stuff.\nBut here we're 100% focused on each other\nand focus on the idea.\nAnd like sometimes playing with ideas\nthat we both don't know the answer to,\nlike a question we don't\nknow the answer to.\nWe're both like fumbling with it,\ntrying to figure out,\ntrying to get some insights\nat something we haven't\nreally figured out before\nand together arriving at that.\nI think that's magical.\nI don't know why we need\nmicrophones for that,\nbut we somehow do.\n- It feels like doing science.\n- It feels like doing\nscience for me, definitely.\nThat's exactly it.\nAnd I'm really glad you said that\nbecause I don't actually often say this,\nbut that's exactly what I felt like.\nI wanted to talk to friends\nand colleagues at MIT\nto do real science together.\nThat's how I felt about it.\nLike to really talk through problems\nthat are actually interesting,\nas opposed to like incremental work\nthat we're currently working for\nfor a particular conference.\nSo really asking questions like,\nwhat are we doing?\nLike, where's this headed to?\nLike, what are the big,\nis this really going to help us solve,\nin the case of AI, solve intelligence?\nLike, is this even\nworking on intelligence?\nThere's a certain sense,\nwhich is why I initially called\nit artificial intelligence.\nIs like most of us are not working\non artificial intelligence.\nYou're working on some\nvery specific problem\nand a set of techniques,\nat the time it's machine learning\nto solve this particular problem.\nThis is not going to take us to a system\nthat is anywhere close\nto the generalizability\nof the human mind.\nLike the kind of stuff\nthe human mind can do\nin terms of memory, in terms of cognition,\nin terms of reasoning,\ncommon sense reasoning.\nThis doesn't seem to take us there.\nSo the initial impulse was,\ncan I talk to these folks\ndo science together through conversation?\nAnd I also thought that\nthere was not enough,\nI didn't think there was\nenough good conversations\nwith world-class minds that I got to meet.\nAnd not the ones with the book,\nor like this was just the thing.\nOftentimes you go on this\ntour when you have a book,\nbut there's a lot of minds\nthat don't write books.\n- And the books constrain\nthe conversation too,\nwhen you're talking about\nthis thing, this book.\n- But there's,\nI've noticed that,\nwith people that haven't written\na book who are brilliant,\nwe get to talk about ideas in a new way.\nWe both haven't actually,\nwhen we raise a question,\nwe don't know the answer to it\nonce the question is raised.\nAnd we try to arrive there.\nLike, I dunno,\nI remember asking questions\nof world-class researchers\nin deep learning of,\nwhy do neural networks\nwork as well as they do?\nThat question is often loosely asked,\nbut like when you have microphones\nand you have to think through it,\nand you have 30 minutes to an hour\nto think through it together,\nI think that's science.\nI think that's really powerful.\nSo that was the one goal.\nThe other one is,\nagain, don't usually talk about this,\nbut there's some sense in which I wanted\nto have dangerous conversations.\nPart of the reasons I\nwanted to wear a suit\nis like, I want it to be fearless.\nThe reason I don't usually talk about it\nis because I feel like I'm\nnot good at conversation.\nSo it looks like it doesn't\nmatch the current skill level.\nBut I wanted to have really\ndangerous conversations\nthat I uniquely would be able to do.\nNot completely uniquely,\nbut like, I'm a huge fan of Joe Rogan,\nand I had to ask myself,\nwhat conversations can I\ndo that Joe Rogan can't?\nFor me, I know I bring this up,\nbut for me that person I thought about\nat the time was Putin.\nLike that's why I bring him up.\nHe's just like with Costello,\nhe's not just a person.\nHe's also an idea to me\nfor what I strive for.\nJust to have those\ndangerous conversations.\nAnd the reason I'm uniquely qualified\nas both the Russian,\nbut also there's the judo\nand the martial arts,\nthere's a lot of elements that\nmake me have a conversation\nhe hasn't had before.\nAnd there's a few other people\nthat I kept in mind, like Don Knuth,\nis a computer scientist from Stanford\nthat I thought is one of the\nmost beautiful minds ever.\nAnd nobody really talked to him,\nlike really talked to him.\nHe did a few lectures, which people love,\nbut really just have a\nconversation with him.\nThere's a few people like that.\nOne of them passed away, John Conway,\nthat I never got,\nwe agreed to talk, but\nhe died before we did.\nThere's a few people like that,\nthat I thought like it's such a crime\nto not hear those folks.\nAnd I have the unique ability\nto know how to purchase\na microphone on Amazon\nand plug it into a\ndevice that records audio\nand then publish it, which\nseems relatively unique.\nLike that's not easy in\nthe scientific community.\nPeople knowing how to\nplug in a microphone.\n- No.\nThey can build Faraday cages,\nand two-photon microscopes\nand bioengineer,\nall sorts of things,\nbut the idea that you could take ideas\nand export them into a\nstructure or a pseudo structure\nthat people would benefit from\nseems like a cosmic achievement to them.\n- I don't know if it's fear\nor just a basically they haven't tried it,\nso they haven't learned the skill level.\n- But I think they're not trained.\nI mean, we could riff on this for awhile,\nbut I think that,\nbut it's important.\nAnd maybe we should, which is that it's,\nthey're not trained to do it.\nThey're trained to think in specific games\nand specific hypotheses,\nand many of them don't care to, right?\nThey became scientists because\nthat's where they felt safe,\nand so why would they\nleave that Haven of safety?\n- Well, they also don't\nnecessarily always see\nthe value in it.\nWe're all together learning,\nyou and I are learning the value of this.\nI think you're probably having\nan exceptionally successful\nand amazing podcast\nthat you started just recently.\n- Thanks to your encouragement.\n- Well, but there's a\nraw skill there that's,\nyou're definitely an inspiration to me\nin how you did the podcast\nin the level of excellence you reach.\nBut I think you've discovered\nthat that's also an\nimpactful way to do science.\nThat podcast.\nAnd I think a lot of scientists\nhave not yet discovered that.\nThat this is a,\nif they apply same kind of rigor\nas they do to academic publication\nor to even conference presentations,\nand they do that rigor\nand effort to podcast,\nwhatever that is,\nthat could be a five-minute podcast,\na two-hour podcasts,\nit could be conversational,\nor it can be more like lecture like,\nif they apply that effort,\nyou have the potential to reach over time,\ntens of thousands, hundreds of thousands,\nmillions of people.\nAnd that's really, really powerful.\nBut yeah, for me giving a\nplatform to a few of those folks,\nespecially for me personally,\nso maybe you can speak to\nwhat fields you're drawn to,\nbut I thought computer scientists\nwere especially bad at this.\nSo there's brilliant computer scientists\nthat I thought it would be\namazing to explore their mind,\nexplore their thinking.\nAnd so that I took that almost as an,\non as an effort.\nAnd at the same time I\nhad other guests in mind,\nor people that connect\nto my own interests.\nSo the wrestling.\nWrestling, music, football,\nboth American football and soccer.\nI have a few particular people\nthat I'm really interested in.\nBuvaisar Saitiev.\nThe Saitiev brothers,\neven Khabib for wrestling,\njust to talk to them, 'cause.\n- Oh, 'cause you can,\nyou guys can communicate-\n- In Russian and in wrestling, right?\nAs wrestlers and as Russians.\nAnd so that little,\nit's like an opportunity to explore a mind\nthat I'm able to bring to the world.\nAnd also it,\nI feel like it makes me a better person,\njust that being that vulnerable\nand exploring ideas together.\nI don't know, like good conversation.\nI don't know how often\nyou have really good\nconversation with friends,\nbut like podcasts are like that.\nAnd it's deeply moving.\n- It's the best.\nAnd what you brought through.\nI mean, when I saw you\nsit down with Penrose,\nNobel Prize winning physicist,\nand these other folks that,\nit's not just 'cause he has a Nobel,\nit's what comes out of\nhis mouth is incredible.\nAnd what you were able to\nhold in that conversation\nwas so much better,\nlight years beyond what he\nhad any other interviewer,\nI don't want to even\ncall you an interviewer\n'cause it's really about conversation.\nLight years beyond what anyone else\nhad been able to engage with him\nwas such a beacon of what's possible.\nAnd I know that,\nI think that's what people are drawn to.\nAnd there's a certain intimacy,\nthat certainly to people,\nour friends, as we are,\nand they know each other,\nthat there's more of that,\nbut there's an intimacy\nin those kinds of private conversations\nthat are made public.\nAnd.\n- Well, that's the, with you,\nyou're probably starting\nto realize, and Costello,\nis like, part of it,\nbecause you're authentic\nand you're putting yourself\nout there completely,\npeople are almost not just consuming\nthe words you're saying,\nthey also enjoy watching you, Andrew,\nstruggle with these ideas\nor try to communicate these ideas.\nThey like the flaws,\nthey like a human being.\n- Oh, good, that flaws.\n- Well, that's good 'cause\nI got plenty of those.\n- But they like the self-critical aspects,\nlike where you're very careful,\nwhere you're very\nself-critical about your flaws.\nI mean, in that same way,\nit's interesting I think for people\nto watch me talk to Penrose,\nnot just because Penrose\nis communicating ideas,\nbut here's this like silly\nkid trying to explore ideas.\nLike they know this kid.\nThere's a human connection\nthat is really powerful.\nSame, I think with Putin, right?\nLike it's not just as a\ngood interview with Putin,\nit's also, here's this kid struggling\nto talk with one of the most powerful,\nsome will argue dangerous\npeople in the world.\nThey love that.\nThe authenticity that led up to that.\nAnd in return,\nI get to connect,\neverybody I run to in the street\nand all those kinds of things,\nthere's a depth of connection there,\nalmost within like a minute or\ntwo that's unlike any other.\n- Yeah, there's an intimacy\nthat you've formed with with them.\n- Yeah, we've been on this\nlike journey together.\nAnd yeah, I have the\nsame thing with Joe Rogan\nbefore I ever met him, right?\nLike I was,\nbecause I was a fan of\nJoe for so many years,\nthere's something,\nthere's a kind of friendship\nas absurd as it might be\nto say in podcasting and\nlistening to podcasts.\n- Yeah.\nMaybe it fills in a little bit of that\nor solves a little bit of that loneliness\nthat you've been talking about earlier.\n- Until the robots are here.\n[laughing]\n- I have just a couple more questions,\nbut one of them is on behalf\nof your audience, which is,\nI'm not going to ask you\nthe meaning of the hedgehog,\nbut I just want to know,\ndoes it have a name?\nAnd you don't have to tell us the name,\nbut just, does it have a name?\nYes or no?\n- Well, there's a name he\nlikes to be referred to as,\nand then there's a private name\nin the privacy of his own\ncompany that we call each other.\nNo.\n[Lex laughing]\nI'm not that insane.\nNo, his name is Hedgy.\nHe's a hedgehog.\nI don't like stuffed animals.\nBut his story is one of minimalism.\nSo I gave away everything I own,\nnow three times in my life.\nBy everything I mean almost everything,\nkept jeans and shirt and a laptop.\nAnd recently it's also been guitar,\nthings like that.\nBut he survived because he was always in,\nat least in the first two\ntimes was in the laptop bag,\nand he just got lucky.\nAnd so I just liked the\nperseverance of that.\nAnd I first saw him in the,\nthe reason I got a stuffed animal,\nI don't have other stuffed animals,\nis it was in a thrift store,\nin this like giant pile of stuffed animals\nand he jumped out at me,\nbecause unlike all the rest of them,\nhe has this intense mean look about him.\nThat he's just,\nhe's upset at life,\nat the cruelty of life.\nAnd it's just,\nespecially in the contrast\nof the other stuffed animals,\nthey have this dumb smile on their face.\nIf you look at most stuffed animals,\nthey have this dumb look on their face.\nThey're just happy.\nIs like \"Pleasantville.\"\n- It's what we say in neuroscience,\nthey have a smooth cortex,\nnot many form.\n- Exactly.\nAnd this,\nlike Hedgy like saw through all of it.\nHe was like Dustyesky's\nman from underground.\nI mean, there's a sense\nthat he saw the darkness of\nthe world and persevered.\nSo like,\nand there's also a famous Russian cartoon,\n\"Hedgehog in the Fog\" that I grew up with,\nI connected with.\n[Lex laughing]\nPeople who know of that cartoon,\nyou could see it on YouTube, it's.\n- \"Hedgehog in the Fog.\"\n- Yeah.\n[Lex laughing]\nIt's just, as you would expect,\nespecially from like\nearly Soviet cartoons.\nIt's a hedgehog, like sad,\nwalking through the fog,\nexploring like loneliness and sadness.\nIt's like, but it's beautiful.\nIt's like a piece of art,\npeople should,\neven if you don't speak Russian,\nyou'll see, you'll understand.\n- Oh, the moment you said\nthat I was going to ask,\nso it's in Russian?\nBut of course it's in-\n- It's in Russian, but it's more,\nit's very little speaking in it.\nIt's almost a,\nthere's an interesting exploration\nof how you make sense of the world\nwhen you see it only\nvaguely through the fog.\nSo he's trying to understand the world.\n- We have Mickey Mouse,\nwe have Bugs Bunny.\nWe have all these crazy animals,\nand you have the \"Hedgehog in the Fog.\"\n- So there's a certain period,\nand this is again,\nI don't know what it's attributed to,\nbut it was really powerful,\nwhich there's a period in Soviet history,\nI think probably '70s and '80s where like,\nespecially kids were\ntreated very seriously.\nLike they were treated\nlike they're able to deal\nwith the weightiness of life.\nAnd that was reflected in the cartoons.\nAnd there was,\nit was allowed to have like\nreally artistic content,\nnot like dumb cartoons\nthat are trying to get you\nto like smile and run around,\nbut like create art.\nLike stuff that,\nyou know how like short cartoons\nor short films can win Oscars,\nlike that's what they're swinging for.\n- So what strikes me\nabout this is a little bit\nhow we were talking\nabout the suit earlier,\nit's almost like they\ntreat kids with respect.\n- Yeah.\n- Like that they have an intelligence\nand they honor that intelligence.\n- Yeah, they're really\njust adult in a small body.\nLike you want to protect them\nfrom the true cruelty of the world.\n- Sure.\n- But in terms of their\nintellectual capacity\nor like philosophical capacity,\nthey are right there with you.\nAnd so that the cartoons reflected that,\nthe art that they consumed,\neducation reflected that.\nSo he represents that.\nI mean, there's a sense of,\nbecause it's survived so long\nand because I don't like stuffed animals,\nthat it's like we've been\nthrough all of this together\nand it's the same,\nsharing the moments\ntogether as the friendship.\nAnd there's a sense in which,\nif all the world turns\non you and goes to hell,\nat least we got each other.\nAnd he doesn't die,\nbecause he's an inanimate object, so.\n- Until you animate him.\n- Until you animate him.\nAnd then I probably would want to know\nwhat he was thinking\nabout this whole time.\nHe's probably really into Taylor Swift\nor something like that.\nAnd it's like that I wouldn't\neven want to know anyway.\n- Well, I now feel a connection to Hedgy,\nthe hedgehog that I\ncertainly didn't have before.\nAnd I think that encapsulates\nthe kind of possibility of connection\nthat is possible between\nhuman and other object\nand through robotics certainly.\nThere's a saying that I heard\nwhen I was a graduate student\nthat's just been ringing in my mind\nthroughout this conversation in such a,\nI think appropriate way, which is that,\nLex, you are in a minority of one,\nyou are truly extraordinary\nin your ability to encapsulate\nso many aspects of science, engineering,\npublic communication,\nabout so many topics,\nmartial arts and the emotional\ndepth that you bring to it.\nAnd just the purposefulness,\nand I think if it's not clear to people,\nit absolutely should be stated.\nBut I think it's abundantly clear\nthat just the amount of time\nand thinking that you put into things is,\nit is the ultimate mark of respect.\nSo, I'm just extraordinarily\ngrateful for your friendship\nand for this conversation.\n- I'm proud to be a friend.\nAnd I just wished you showed me\nthe same kind of respect by wearing a suit\nand make your father\nproud maybe next time.\n[Andrew laughing]\n- Next time indeed.\nThanks so much my friend.\n- Thank you.\nThank you, Andrew.\n- Thank you for joining\nme for my discussion\nwith Dr. Lex Fridman.\nIf you're enjoying
