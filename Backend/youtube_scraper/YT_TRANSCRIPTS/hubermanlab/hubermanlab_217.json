    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life.\n[upbeat music]\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nToday, we're going to talk\nabout science-based protocols\nfor sleep, mood, learning,\nnutrition, exercise of various kinds,\nstrength and endurance, and hypertrophy,\nand we are going to talk\nabout some protocols\nthat relate to creativity.\nWe're going to talk about\nbehavioral protocols,\nsupplement based protocols,\nall science backed by quality,\npeer-reviewed literature.\nThe reason that we're\nholding this episode now is\nthat in the recent previous episodes,\nwe've covered some pretty\nintense and in-depth topics.\nWe've talked about vision and how we see\nand how to get better at seeing\nand how to maintain vision.\nWe've talked about hearing and balance.\nWe've talked about chemical sensing.\nAnd we had a guest episode\nthat covered a lot of\ninformation about new\nand emerging technologies in neuroscience,\nas well as mental health.\nThat was the interview episode\nwith Dr. Karl Deisseroth.\nSo given that we've covered\nso much detailed information\nin the previous 27 episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast,\nI decided that we would hold office hours.\nOffice hours in the university setting are\nwhen students come to\nthe professor's office\nor you meet outdoors on\ncampus or in the classroom\nto review the material and questions\nfrom lecture in more detail.\nNow, unfortunately, we\ndon't have the opportunity\nto meet face to face in\nreal life, but nonetheless,\nyou've been sending your questions,\nputting them in the comment\nsection on YouTube, et cetera,\nand I prepared a number of answers\nto the questions that have\nshown up most frequently.\nNow, in order to provide context\nand structure to the way\nthat we will address these questions,\nI've arranged the science\nand science-based protocols\nthat relate to various aspects of life-\nsuch as mood, exercise, sleep, waking,\nanxiety, creativity, et cetera-\ninto the context of a day.\nSelecting the unit of a day in order\nto deliver this science information\nand protocols is not a\nhaphazard decision on my part.\nIt's actually the case that\nevery cell in our body,\nevery organ in our body,\nand our brain is modulating or changes\nacross the 24 hour a day\nin a very regular and predictable rhythm.\nAnd it's no coincidence\nthat the Earth spins once\non its axis every 24 hours.\nThese two things are\ncoordinated by virtue of genes\nand different proteins and things\nthat are expressed in\nevery cell of your body.\nAnd so selecting the unit of the day\nis not just a practical one,\nbut it's one that's related\nto our deeper biology.\nYou may have heard in my interview episode\nwith Dr. Karl Deisseroth that he himself,\nin order to juggle a tremendous workload,\na full-time clinical practice,\na lab of 40 plus people,\na family of five children, et cetera,\nbreaks up his life into units of days.\nAnd so today we are going\nto further dissect the day\nas a unit that one can manage\nand manage extremely well,\nand, in fact, can optimize.\nSo we're basically going to talk about\nhow to leverage science-based protocols.\nAnd when I say science, I mean,\nquality, peer-reviewed science published\nin excellent journals.\nWe're going to talk about\nhow to take that science,\nconvert it into specific\nprotocols that break up\nalong the course of a single day\nand direct certain types of behaviors\nin order to optimize the\nvarious features of life.\nI will couch this in\nthe context of what I do\nacross a daily 24-hour rhythm.\nThat doesn't mean that you\nhave to follow this schedule\nat all or even in part.\nIt's just by way of example.\nAny number of the different things\nthat I describe could\nbe applied to any number\nof different schedules or frameworks.\nBut if there's one truth\nthat applies to all of us,\nis that we all have to exist\nwithin the context of this 24 hour rhythm\nthat we all possess.\nSo that's what we'll focus on.\nBefore we begin,\nI'd like to emphasize that\nthis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is, however, part\nof my desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes eyeglasses and sunglasses\nthat I believe are the very\nhighest quality possible.\nDeveloped by two All-American\nswimmers from Stanford,\nROKA sunglasses and\neyeglasses were developed\nwith their intention to create sunglasses\nand eyeglasses that\ncould be worn anywhere.\nSo while exercising or while working,\nat home, while driving.\nThe reason I like ROKA glasses\nso much is that first of all,\nthey're extremely lightweight.\nThe optical clarity of\nthe lenses is excellent,\nand so I often just forget\nthat I have even have them on.\nWhen I'm outside and\nI'm wearing sunglasses,\nthey have this really terrific feature\nwhich is that I can move\nin and out of shadows\nor the cloud cover can change\nand I can see perfectly\nwell the entire time.\nYou know, many eyeglasses and\nsunglasses that I've tried,\ndepending on what we call the\n\"ambient lighting conditions,\"\nthe local lighting conditions outside,\nI have to take them off\nor put them back on.\nIt's really annoying for me.\nBut with ROKA glasses, somehow,\nI'm assuming because they\nreally understand the science\nof the visual system,\nthe eyeglasses and\nsunglasses work seamlessly\nwith whatever environment you're in.\nSo that's absolutely terrific.\nAnother thing about ROKA\neyeglasses and sunglasses is\nthat their aesthetic is really terrific.\nYou know, I don't think\nI'm alone in saying\nthat many performance\nglasses as they're called end\nup making people look like a cyborg,\nbut the sunglasses are of\nthe sort that, you know,\nyou can wear while running or biking\nor driving or out to dinner.\nI don't typically wear\nsunglasses while out to dinner,\nbut you get the idea.\nYou can wear them anywhere\nand they look very natural.\nThey have a huge number of\ndifferent styles to select from.\nIf you'd like to try ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to ROKA, that's R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's ROKA, R-O-K-A.com,\nand enter the code huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also\nbrought to us by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood\nand DNA to help you better\nunderstand your body\nand help you reach your health goals.\nI've long been a believer in\ngetting regular blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the factors\nthat impact your immediate\nand long-term health can only be analyzed\nfrom a quality blood test.\nWith InsideTracker, it\nalleviates a specific problem\nthat's associated with most, if not all,\nof the other blood tests\nand DNA tests out there.\nAnd that problem is you get information\nback about the levels of various things,\nmetabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what to\ndo with that information.\nWith InsideTracker, they\nhave this terrific dashboard\nthat allows you to both see\nyour levels of hormones,\nmetabolic factors, and the rest,\nbut also, it suggests specific\nthings that you can do\nwith your nutrition, your\nexercise, and lifestyle,\nand so forth in order\nto bring those levels\ninto the ranges that are\nbest for your immediate\nand long-term health.\nIn addition, they make the whole process\nof getting your blood\nand DNA taken very easy.\nThey'll even come to your\nhome to take the sample.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off any\nof InsideTracker's plans.\nJust use the code HUBERMAN at checkout.\nThat's insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of\nInsideTracker's plans.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are ideally matched your sleep needs.\nI started sleeping on a Helix mattress\nabout eight months ago,\nand I can honestly say it's the best sleep\nthat I've ever had in my entire life.\nAnd that's because the mattress\nwas actually designed for me.\nAnd you can have a\nmattress designed for you.\nIf you go to helixsleep.com,\nthey have this free, very\nbrief, two-minute quiz\nthat asks you a number of questions\nlike do you sleep on\nyour side or your back?\nDo you tend to run warm while you sleep\nor do you tend to get cold\nin the middle of the night?\nMaybe you don't know the\nanswers to those questions,\nand that's fine too.\nAfter taking that quiz,\nthey will match you to a specific mattress\nthat's ideal for your sleep needs.\nI matched to the\nso-called \"Dusk Mattress,\"\nD-U-S-K, because I wanted a\nmattress that was not too firm,\nnot too soft.\nAs I mentioned, I absolutely love it.\nIf you're interested in\nupgrading your mattress,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,\ntake their two-minute sleep quiz,\nand they'll match you\nto a customized mattress\nand you'll get up to $200\noff your mattress order\nand two free pillows.\nThey also make these terrific pillows.\nThey have a 10-year warranty\nand you get to try out the mattress\nfor 100 nights risk free.\nIf you don't like it,\nthey'll come pick it up\nand they'll take it away,\nbut I think you'll love it.\nI certainly love mine.\nAgain, if you're interested,\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman\nfor up to $200 off and two free pillows.\nSo let's talk about how to apply quality,\npeer-reviewed science to your day\nand how to optimize everything\nfrom sleep to learning,\ncreativity, meal timing, et cetera.\nAs I mentioned earlier,\nI'm going to do this in\nthe context of my day\nand what I typically do.\nHowever, the specific protocols\nfor any number of different things,\nsleep, relaxation, meal\ntiming, exercise, et cetera,\nany one or all of those\ncould be rearranged\nto suit your specific needs.\nI'm going to tell you what I\ndo from morning until waking\nand even what I do while I sleep in order\nto optimize my sleep.\nSo let's start with\ngetting up in the morning.\nNow, for me, I tend to wake\nup sometime around 6:00 AM,\n6:30, sometimes as late as 7:00 AM.\nI don't typically sleep\nmuch later than 7:00 AM.\nThe first thing I do after\nI wake up is I take the pen\nthat's on my nightstand\nand the pad of paper on my nightstand\nand I write down the\ntime in which I woke up.\nNow, I do sleep with my phone in my room.\nI realized this is considered a sin\nand has certain hazards\nassociated with it,\nbut I put my phone on airplane mode\nabout an hour before I go to sleep.\nAnd then I set my alarm\ntypically for 6:30 AM.\nAnd some days the alarm wakes me up;\nother days I wake up before the alarm.\nAnd yes, some days the alarm goes off\nand I hit snooze a few times,\nand then usually by 7:00\nAM, I am up and out of bed.\nThe reason for writing\ndown what time I wake up is\nbecause I want to know\nthat average wake up time.\nThat average wake up time informs\nwhat's called my \"temperature minimum.\"\nIt tells me when my body\ntemperature was lowest.\nThe temperature minimum is the time\nin each 24-hour cycle that your\nbody temperature is lowest.\nI don't sleep with a thermometer\nin my mouth or elsewhere,\nand I don't think you should either.\nInstead, I know that\nthe lowest temperature\nthat my body will be at\nacross the 24-hour cycle tends\nto be two hours before\nmy typical wake up time.\nAnd I want to know that number.\nIt's called our \"temperature minimum.\"\nSo if you're somebody that\ntypically wakes up at 8:00 AM,\nthen your temperature minimum\nis sometime around 6:00 AM.\nRemember, the temperature\nminimum is a time\nin the 24-hour cycle.\nI don't care what my\nactual temperature is;\nI care when my lowest temperature is.\nAnd I know that that lowest temperature\nis approximately two hours\nbefore my average wake-up time.\nSo I highly recommend that you write down\nwhen you wake up or track that in some way\nthat works for you and use\nthat as a reference point\nto determine your temperature minimum.\nWe will return to the temperature minimum\nand how you can leverage\nthe temperature minimum\nfor several things:\nshifting your clock,\nshifting your circadian sleep\nschedule and wake schedule.\nAlso for shifting your\neating schedule, et cetera,\nWe will return to that.\nBut even if you don't travel,\neven if you don't care\nabout things like jet lag,\neven if you sleep\nfabulously all year round,\nnever have a poor night's sleep,\nknowing your temperature minimum,\nthat time when your temperature\nis at its lowest point,\nis a valuable thing to know.\nThe second thing I do after I wake up is\nto get into forward ambulation,\nwhich is just nerd\nspeak for taking a walk.\nI have a dog, and as many of you know,\nhe's a bulldog and he\ndoesn't really like to walk,\nespecially not in the morning.\nBut for humans and for animals,\nthere's a phenomenon whereby\nwhen we generate our own forward motion,\nforward ambulation,\nvisual images pass by us on our eyes,\nso-called \"optic flow.\"\nAnd for those of you that\nare low vision or no vision,\nthe same phenomenon occurs\nin the auditory system.\nSounds pass by us in\nso-called \"auditory flow.\"\nGetting into a mode of forward ambulation,\nand especially experiencing visual flow,\nhas a powerful effect\non the nervous system.\nThe effect it has is essentially\nto quiet or reduce the\namount of neural activity\nin this brain structure\ncalled the \"amygdala.\"\nAmygdala means \"almond,\"\nand many of you have probably\nheard about the amygdala\nfor its role in anxiety and\nfear and threat detection.\nAnd indeed, the amygdala\nis part of the network\nin the brain that\ngenerates feelings of fear\nand threat and anxiety.\nIt does a bunch of other things too,\nbut that's one of its primary functions.\nThere are now at least half a\ndozen quality papers published\nin quality, peer-reviewed\njournals that show\nthat forward ambulation,\nwalking or biking or running,\nin generating optic flow in particular\nhas this incredible property\nof lowering activity\nin the amygdala and thereby\nreducing levels of anxiety.\nThere are two papers that I'd like\nto highlight in particular\nthat relate to this phenomenon.\nThe first one was published\nin the journal Neuron\nand the title of this paper\nis \"Whole-Brain Functional\nUltrasound Imaging,\"\nthat just means they have a cool technique\nto evaluate the activity\nof structures in the brain\nacross the entire brain,\nreveals brain modules for\nvisual motor integration.\nWhat they found in this study,\nand I should mention the\nfirst author is Mace,\nthis comes from Botond Roska's group,\nthis was work done in mice,\nbut I'll talk about other\nspecies in a moment.\nWhat they found was essentially that\nwhen these mice walk forward\nand their eyes move from side to side,\nwhich is a natural\nconsequence of moving forward,\nso-called \"optic flow\" is\nflowing past their eyes,\nmany brain areas are activated,\nincrease in their level of firing,\nbut the amygdala in particular\nreduced its levels of firing.\nThat's a very interesting\nfinding, but it is in mice.\nHowever, another paper,\n\"Eye-Movement Intervention\nEnhances Extinction\nvia Amygdala Deactivation,\"\nwas published in The\nJournal of Neuroscience,\na strong journal, and shows that, again,\nthese eye movements, these\nlateral eye movements\nfrom side to side reduce activity levels\nin this fear/threat/anxiety center\nin the brain, the amygdala.\nNow, those are eye movements.\nThey didn't specifically\nlook at forward ambulation.\nAnd yet other papers have\nlooked at forward ambulation\nand we know that forward\nambulation, walking forward,\ngenerates the sorts of eye movements\nthat cause optic flow and\nreductions in amygdala activation.\nSo for me, this process of taking\na walk each morning isn't about exercise.\nIt's not about burning calories.\nIt's not about any of that.\nIt's really about getting into optic flow\nand reducing the levels\nof amygdala activation.\nNow, I don't have anxiety,\nat least I don't have chronic anxiety\nor generalized anxiety.\nI tend to have a lot of energy,\nbut at these points in the morning,\nI'm not very energetic.\nSometimes I'm sort of shuffling more\nthan I'm walking in fact.\nAnd Costello is almost always shuffling\nand I'm almost always trying\nto drag him first thing\nin the morning.\nBut that walk is a particularly\nimportant protocol each day\nbecause it really serves\nto push my neurology\nin the direction that I'd like it to go,\nwhich is alert, but not anxious.\nAnd it's kind of a fine line sometimes,\nespecially as events\nsurface throughout the day,\nemails come in, text messages come in,\nget bombarded with a number of things.\nI want to be alert and responsive.\nI want to be able to focus,\nbut I don't want to. feel anxious\nor reactive to these things.\nSo the forward ambulation and\nthis optic flow is the way\nthat I ensure, based on\nquality, peer-reviewed data,\nthat my amygdala activation\nis slightly suppressed.\nNow, at the same time, I\nalso want the alertness.\nI want alert and focused.\nI don't just want to be sleepy\nor super, super relaxed.\nI want to have a high degree\nof focus and alertness\nbecause I'm soon going to\nmove into a about of work.\nI need to lean into the day.\nSo in order to do that,\nI make sure that the\nwalking is done outdoors.\nThat might be sort of a duh,\nbut many people get up and\nstart moving around their house,\ntheir apartment, and\nthey don't go anywhere.\nAnd just walking around inside,\nit will generate some optic flow,\nbut nothing like the sort of optic flow\nthat you can generate\nin larger environments\nlike out of doors environments.\nIf you can't get outdoors,\ndoing it indoors is perfectly fine,\nbut it's not going to\nhave the same magnitude\nof positive effect.\nNow, in order to get the alertness,\nI do it outdoors because I\nalso want sunlight in my eyes.\nI know many of you have heard\nme talk about this ad nauseam\non various podcasts, in this podcast,\nbut getting sunlight in\nyour eyes first thing\nin the morning is absolutely vital\nto mental and physical health.\nIt is perhaps the most\nimportant thing that any\nand all of us can and should do in order\nto promote metabolic well-being,\npromote the positive functioning\nof your hormone system,\nget your mental health steering\nin the right direction.\nThere are a number of reasons for this,\nbut before I get into those reasons,\nlet me just emphasize\nwhat the protocol is.\nThe protocol is get outdoors,\nideally with no sunglasses\nif you can do that safely,\neven if there's cloud cover.\nMore photons, light information are coming\nthrough that cloud cover\nthan would be coming\nfrom a very bright indoor bulb.\nSo getting outdoors is absolutely key.\nHow long should you do this?\nIt's going to depend on the\nbrightness of the environment.\nIt's going to depend on a\nnumber of different factors.\nTwo minutes would be a minimum,\n10 minutes would be even better,\nand if you can, 30 minutes\nwould be fantastic.\nNow, it's a very bright day or, you know,\nyou live in a place where\nthere's bright sunlight,\nclear day on a snowfield,\nyou would only need\nsomething like 60 seconds.\nBut most people aren't living\nin those sorts of conditions.\nSo getting outside for a 10-minute walk\nor a 15-minute walk will basically ensure\nthat you're getting adequate\nstimulation of these neurons\nin the eye that are\ncalled the \"melanopsin,\"\nintrinsically photosensitive\nganglion cells.\nI know that's a mouthful.\nThese are neurons that don't\ncare about shapes of objects\nor the motion of objects.\nThese are neurons that convey to the brain\nthat it's daytime and\nit's time to be alert.\nAnd it sets in motion a huge\nnumber of biological cascades\nwithin every cell and organ of your body\nfrom your liver to your gut,\nto your heart, to your brain.\nIt really sets things down the right path.\nEarly in the day,\nwe experience a natural and healthy bump\nin a hormone called \"cortisol.\"\nCortisol comes from the amygdala.\nThat cortisol, as I mentioned,\nis healthy and normal\nand promotes wakefulness.\nIt actually promotes a\nhealthy immune system.\nSo I know you've heard that stress\nand cortisol disrupt the immune system,\nbut not the short little pulse of cortisol\nthat you get each morning.\nIt's very important that that pulse\nof cortisol arrive early in the day.\nI want to emphasize this again.\nIt's very important that that pulse\nof cortisol arrive early in the day\nAnd that pulse of cortisol\nis going to happen\nonce every 24 hours no matter what.\nIt's going to happen\nand you get to time it.\nHow do you time it?\nPrimarily by when you view bright sunlight\nor bright light of another kind,\nand we'll talk about that in a moment.\nSo you want that cortisol pushed early.\nIf you wake up before the sun comes out,\nit's fine to turn on artificial lights,\nbut then you would want to get outside\nas soon as you can to get this, excuse me,\nnatural light stimulation of your eyes.\nAnd it does have to be to your eyes.\nJust to really drill down\ninto the details for a moment,\nyou don't want to stare\ndirectly at the sun\nor any light that's so\nbright that it feels painful.\nIf you feel like you have\nto close your eyes or blink, please do.\nYou don't want to damage your retinas.\nThe point here is to get\nthe sunlight indirectly.\nIt's going to essentially\nbe scattered everywhere\nthrough the cloud cover,\nbut you know from looking at\nus at a flashlight directly\ninto that flashlight\nversus looking at the beam\nthat flashlight generates on the ground\nthat if you're standing in the shade,\nyou're going to. get less of that sunlight\nthan you are if you're\nout in an open field.\nSo this is why the time outside,\nit's going to need to vary depending\non your particular environment.\nBut do your best to do this every day.\nIf you miss a day, no big deal,\nbut try not to miss more than one day.\nOtherwise your mental\nand physical health will start to suffer.\nAnd doing this each day costs nothing.\nIt's just time\nYou can combine it with the\nforward ambulation with the walk\nand the optic flow that\nI talked about before.\nAnd that's what I do each morning\nto generate a sense of\nalertness in my body\nand brain to generate a\nsense of calm, yet alert.\nAnd that's also what I do with\nCostello, with my bulldog.\nPeople have asked me,\ndo the same mechanisms apply to animals?\nWell, the reality is\nmany of these mechanisms\nwere actually discovered in animals,\nand then were tested in humans\nand verified that they\nalso exist in humans.\nNot always.\nSometimes it was the reverse,\nwhere they were tested first in humans,\nand then brought to animals.\nBut indeed, your dog, your horse,\nyou know, I don't know what\nother animals are out there,\nthey need this.\nNow, if you have a hamster\nor a nocturnal animal,\nthe reason why they like to\nrun on their wheels at night is\nbecause they're nocturnal.\nThey don't like being in the light.\nLight actually causes\nthem to freeze, right?\nActually, if you are into\naquaria, you like fish,\nthey always say, \"Don't\noverfeed your fish.\nYou'll kill the fish.\"\nThat's true, but guess\nwhat the fastest way\nto kill a fish is?\nTo keep the lights on 24 hours a day\nThey also need circadian\nrhythms, these 24-hour rhythms.\nSo we'll do an entire month at\nsome point about pet health,\nbut meanwhile, get that morning sunlight.\nSo now we have a first protocol,\nwhich is to write down the\ntime of day that you wake up,\nthe second protocol is to\ntake a walk first thing\nin the morning,\nand the third protocol is\nwoven in with that walk,\nat least for me, which is to\nget that sunlight exposure.\nNow, if you can't get sunlight exposure,\nyou absolutely can't,\nI don't necessarily recommend buying one\nof these dawn alarm lights.\nAnd I'm sorry to say this,\nbut they're just vastly\noverpriced relative\nto what they are.\nThey're basically a bright LED.\nI instead use, I have a pad\nthat's a 930-lux LightPad.\nI think it was designed for drawing.\nThose are available at\na fraction of the cost\nthat a morning light\nsimulator would provide,\nand yet it's really bright\nenough, at least for me.\nI tend to put it on my desk\nwhile I work each morning.\nSo here's a principle\nthat you can leverage.\nIf you want to be alert,\nview bright lights\nand make those lights above\nyou or in front of you.\nIf you want to go to sleep soon\nor you don't want to be\nawake for whatever reason,\ntry and eliminate your exposure to light.\nAnd this, again, is not about\nexposure of the skin to light;\nthis is about exposure of your eyes,\nof your neural retinas to light.\nFor those of you that are\nconcerned about blue light,\nI want to that blue light\nis precisely the wavelength\nof light that is optimal for\nstimulating these neurons\nin your eye, which set your\ncircadian rhythms properly.\nSo you don't want to shield yourself\nfrom blue light early in the\nday or throughout the day\nor anytime you want to be awake.\nIn fact, that could have a number\nof detrimental consequences.\nFortunately, all those\nconsequences are going\nto be reversible after a short\nperiod of time of making sure\nthat you don't wear your blue blockers\nduring the day, please.\nThe time to wear blue blockers, if you do,\nis at night and in the evening\nwhen you're headed towards sleep.\nMy colleague Samer Hattar,\nwho is head of the chronobiology unit\nat the National Institute\nof Mental Health,\nhas spoken about this\nbefore on my Instagram.\nWe held an Instagram Live and I said,\n\"Samer, what do you think\nabout blue blockers?\"\nAnd he said, \"I don't think\nthat's a good idea at all,\nunless it's really late at night\nand you're in a bright environment\nand you're trying to limit\nthe amount of bright light\nthat impacts the eyes.\"\nEliminating specific wavelengths of light,\nin Samer's opinion and also in my opinion,\nis not a natural thing\nfor the visual system\nand the brain to experience.\nSome people get headaches while they work\non the computer all day\nor staring at screens,\nand so they get blue blockers\nthinking that's going\nto protect them from their headaches.\nHowever, any protection\nthat you get from headaches\nfrom blue blockers is going to be minimal\nin comparison to what's\nreally going on there,\nwhich is that people are viewing devices\nand screens up close for too many hours\nthroughout the 24-hour cycle.\nA better remedy would be to step away\nfrom that computer from time to time,\nand to make sure that you can look far off\ninto the distance.\nIdeally, a distance longer than 20 feet\nlike view a horizon, go out on a balcony,\nthings of that sort.\nTake a walk around, get into optic flow\nSo if you're into blue blockers,\nmake sure you're only wearing\nthem in the late evening\nand at night.\nI personally don't wear\nblue blockers at all.\nI prefer to just control\nmy light viewing behavior\nby doing this, I do the other\nform of circadian control,\nwhich is to dim the lights.\nAnd I do that because dimming the lights\nand setting them lower in the\nenvironment sets up the brain\nand body for sleep much better\nthan simply just wearing some\nblue light blue blockers,\nexcuse me.\nAnd please know if you\ndo wear blue blockers\nthat if the light in your\nenvironment is bright enough,\nit doesn't matter if you're\nblocking out the blues.\nThe cells in the eye will respond\nto other wavelengths of light.\nSo I have no vendetta\nagainst the blue blockers,\nand, you know, I fully\nexpect the blue block-anistas\nto come after me with,\nI guess, blue blockers,\nbut as you do that,\nplease understand that the biology points\nin the direction of get\na lot of bright light\nthroughout the day, including blue light,\nand at night, just limit the\ntotal amount of overall light\nthat you're exposed to,\nincluding from screens.\nSo then Costello and I\nget back from our walk.\nSometimes that walk was 10 minutes,\nsometimes it was 60 minutes,\ndepending on how slowly\nCostello is walking that day.\nIndeed, many mornings I'm\nthe guy carrying his bulldog\nback up the hill.\nMy neighbors know me so well,\nthey know Costello so well\nthat they've since stopped pulling over\nand asking if the dog is okay.\nSometimes they'll ask if I'm okay.\nNonetheless, we get back,\nI give him his food,\nI give him his water,\nand I give me my water.\nI'm a big believer, based on\nquality, peer-reviewed data,\nthat hydration is essential\nfor mental performance.\nNow, I confess I don't really\nlike drinking big glasses\nor big jugs of water first\nthing in the morning.\nI don't know why,\nbut my thirst doesn't tend\nto kick in first thing.\nYou may be different.\nEither way, I force myself, essentially,\nto drink at least 16 and,\nmost days, 32 ounces of water.\nI also put a little bit\nof sea salt in the water.\nAs many of you know,\nneurons require ionic flow.\nWhat that means is neurons need sodium,\nthey need magnesium,\nand they need potassium\nin order to function.\nWe do tend to get dehydrated at night.\nEven if the day is not very hot,\nI try and top off or I try and make sure\nthat I'm hydrated early in the\nday before I begin any work.\nSo I make myself drink this water\nwith a little bit of sea salt.\nHow much sea salt?\nIf you really want to get detailed,\nI suppose it's about half a teaspoon.\nIt's not much, That's what I do.\nAnd I drink that more or\nless room temperature.\nI find that drinking really\ncold water first thing\nin the day kind of like\ncramps up my insides,\nso I don't do that.\nAt that point, I start thinking about\nand fantasizing about\nand craving caffeine,\nbut I don't drink that caffeine yet.\nI purposely delay my caffeine intake\nto 90 minutes to 120\nminutes after I wake up.\nOf course, I know when I wake\nup 'cause I wrote it down,\nalthough it's pretty\neasy to commit to memory.\nThe reason I delay caffeine is\nbecause one of the factors\nthat induces a sense of\nsleepiness is the buildup\nof adenosine or, as some people call it,\nadenosine in our system.\nThe buildup of adenosine accumulates\nthe longer we are awake.\nSo when I wake up in the morning,\nwhen you wake up in the morning,\nyour adenosine levels are\nlikely to be very low.\nHowever, caffeine is an adenosine blocker.\nIt's actually a competitive\nantagonist for you aficionados.\nIt sort of parks in the receptor\nthat adenosine normally would park at\nand prevents adenosine from\nacting on that receptor.\nThat's why you feel more alert,\nbecause it's essentially\nblocking the effect\nof this sleepiness factor\nthat we all create called the \"adenosine.\"\nThe reason for delaying\ncaffeine intake 90 minutes\nto two hours after waking\nis I want to make sure\nthat I don't have a late afternoon\nor even early afternoon\ncrash from caffeine.\nOne of the best ways to\nensure a caffeine crash is\nto drink a bunch of caffeine,\nblock all those adenosine receptors,\nand then by early or late afternoon,\nwhen that caffeine starts to wear off\nand gets dislodged from the receptors,\na lower level of adenosine is able\nto create a greater level of sleepiness.\nIt took me years to figure this out.\nI used to wake up and I'd think,\n\"Oh, I don't want to drink\ncaffeine too close to bedtime,\nso I'm going to start drinking\nmy caffeine really early.\"\nI let my cortisol naturally\ncome up in the morning.\nI avoid drinking caffeine\nuntil about 90 minutes\nor two hours after waking.\nAnd when I do that,\nI find that I don't experience\nthe afternoon crash.\nAt least I don't experience that crash\nunless I do something foolish,\nlike ingest far too much food at lunch\nor I stay up all night the night before.\nBut provided I don't do\nanything foolish like that,\ndelaying caffeine to 90 minutes\nto two hours optimizes this relationship\nbetween adenosine and\nwakefulness and sleepiness\nin a way that really provides a nice,\nconsistent arc of energy\nthroughout the day\nand brings energy down as\nI'm headed toward sleep\nand falling asleep.\nMy primary objective early in the day is\nto get into a mode of being focused,\nyet alert so that I can get work done.\nI found that the best way for me\nto achieve that state is through fasting.\nSo I don't eat anything until\nabout 11:00 AM or 12:00 noon.\nI'm not absolutely religious about it.\nThere are days when I'll\nhave a few Brazil nuts\nor a spoonful or three of almond butter,\nfor instance, but most\ndays I'm not doing that.\nI'm just not eating anything.\nI'm drinking some caffeine caffeine source\nfor me is yerba mate, guayusa tea.\nThose are my preferred sources\nI tend to avoid coffee these days.\nOccasionally I'll have a cup,\nbut most often I stick to the teas.\nI drink water as much as I\nfeel I need to and want to.\nAnd I also drink my athletic greens,\nwhich is compatible at\nleast for me with fasting.\nLet's talk about why fasting works\nto create this heightened\nstate of alertness,\nyet calm brain state.\nFasting increases levels of adrenaline,\nalso called \"epinephrin\"\nin the brain and body.\nAnd when our levels of epinephrin\nand adrenaline are\nincreased, we learn better,\nwe can focus better.\nThere's terrific data supporting that.\nYou don't want epinephrine,\naka adrenaline, too high.\nThat feels like stress and panic.\nYou get jittery, you can't focus.\nBut in its optimal range,\nadrenaline really provides\na heightened sense of focus\nand the ability to\nencode, meaning bring in,\nand retain, remember information.\nAnd so since my job is\nmainly a cerebral one\nwhere I'm writing grants and\nworking on papers, et cetera,\nI fast in the early part of the day.\nI mentioned ingesting things\nlike guayusa or yerba mate\nor, in my case, athletic greens.\nMany people ask, in fact\nthere's a whole community\nand discussion boards, et cetera,\nand YouTube comments on the internet,\nabout what breaks a fast and what doesn't.\nThe fact of the matter is that's going\nto be highly individual because it's going\nto depend on how sensitive\nyour blood sugar.\nAnd more accurately,\nit's going to depend on things\nlike your insulin sensitivity.\nSo for instance,\nif you're somebody who\ngets up in the morning,\nhydrates, and goes out for a six-mile run,\nyou could probably eat\na jar of almond butter\nand still be what's called fat-fasted.\nYour insulin levels will still be very low\nbecause even though that is a\nlarge volume of almond butter,\neven to me and Costello,\nthat large number of calories comes\nfrom a source that doesn't\nincrease blood sugar very much\nand insulin very much.\nNow, I'm not suggesting you do that,\nbut what I just described as\na vastly different situation\nthan somebody that ate\ntheir last meal at 2:00 AM,\nand that meal was essentially a feast.\nAnd for that person,\nfasting until 10:00 or 11:00 AM,\ntheir blood sugar might\nstill actually be pretty high\nor even lowish such that\nthey might eat one almond\nand it would bump them out of fasting.\nSo you get the idea.\nIt's going to depend on\nyour recent eating history,\nyour blood sugar history, your\nglycogen stores, et cetera.\nSo if anyone tells you that\nbreaks a fast or that doesn't,\nthat's kind of silly.\nWould one grain of sugar\nbreak your fast? No.\nWould an entire tablespoon of\nsugar break your fast? Yes.\nYou'll get a big blip in blood\nsugar and insulin from that.\nHowever, how long that lasts,\nhow long it breaks your fast will depend\non how glycogen-depleted you are\nand a number of other factors.\nSo for me, I just keep it fairly simple:\nI ingest water, caffeine from\nyour yerba mate and guayusa,\nand I drink my athletic greens\nwith some lemon juice in it.\nThat constitutes my fasting.\nAnd there are days when\nI do all those things.\nThere are days when I\ndo none of those things.\nAlthough most days,\nI would say about 355\ndays out of the year,\nI'm ingesting water, caffeine,\nand athletic greens during this period\nof fasting early in the day,\nand that's the period of\ntime when I do my work.\nOne interesting fact about yerba mate\nand guayusa teas is that\nthey increase release\nof something called \"GLP-1.\"\nGLP-1 is related to glucagon.\nGlucagon is a hormone\nthat you can sort of think\nabout as opposite to\ninsulin and blood sugar.\nIt's more complex than that,\nbut GLP-1 has a couple\nof positive properties.\nOne is it increases lipolysis\nand mobilization of body fat stores,\nso burning of fat.\nIn fact, there are now a\nnumber of clinical trials\nthat are achieving good success\nand there are drugs out\nthere only available\nby prescription which mimic GLP-1\nand are being used to\ntreat, quite successfully,\ncertain types of diabetes and obesity.\nNow, I'm not diabetic,\nnor am I trying to shed a ton of body fat,\nbut I figure as long as I'm fasting\nand as long as I like\nyerba mate and guayusa,\nwhich I do, they're delicious,\nI'll tell you which\ntype I use in a moment,\nI might as well increase my GLP-1\nbecause it's probably not\nas good as getting out\nand doing some cardio work.\nBut nonetheless, if I'm fasted,\nincreasing GLP-1 in my system,\nI'm going to be alert from\nthe caffeine, the adrenaline,\net cetera, and I'm going\nto burning body fat\nwhile I'm doing my work.\nSo for me, it's just an\nefficient, biochemically rational,\nor I should say grounded\nin quality biochemistry sort of approach.\nYerba mate comes in a\nlot of different forms.\nThere are a lot of different\nbrands out there, et cetera.\nI don't have any relationship whatsoever\nin a business sense to\nany of these brands.\nSome of them are very smoky.\nI, just because of something\nin my genetic makeup,\nor I don't know, maybe it was some sort\nof Y chromosome-associated\nlesion early in life,\nbut I don't like smoky flavors.\nSo I'm not a Gouda cheese guy.\nI don't like smoky stuff.\nYou may love it,\nbut I tend to avoid smoky-tasting mates.\nInstead, there's a particular\nbrand that I just found\non the internet called Anna Park.\nI don't know Anna, I don't\nknow if she has a park,\nand I certainly don't\nknow what Anna Park is,\nbut for me, that's the\nbest-tasting yerba mate.\nAgain, I don't have any\nrelationship to them,\nbut it's affordable in\nthe context of yerba mate\nand it's the one that I use.\nAnd I should mention along\nthe lines of affordability\nand GLP-1 is there's a\nnice feature of yerba mate\nwhich is if you put it in a filter\nor a metal strainer and\nyou pour hot water over it,\nand then drink it, keep the leaves.\nThe yerba mate leaves can\nbe used over and over again.\nIt seems that the GLP-1\nstimulating aspects of yerba mate\nactually are enhanced with\nsubsequent pour overs.\nSo there's something\ninteresting about these teas\nthat my tea aficionado\nfriends tell me allows the tea\nto release more of some of\nthe beneficial compounds\nby reusing the tea leaves.\nNow, eventually it'll grow mold\nand other sorts of disgusting things.\nYou don't really want\nto run that experiment.\nI would say you can\nuse it for a day or two\nbefore it starts to go bad,\nbut that's a feature\nthat will extend the life\nof whatever yerba mate you happen to use\nif you decide to use it,\nand that's certainly what I do.\nNext, I want to talk about what I'm doing\nwhile I'm drinking all this yerba mate.\n'Cause I'm not just sitting there thinking\nabout all the GLP-1\ncirculating in my system.\nI'm working.\nA couple of things for\noptimizing workspace\nthat are grounded in\nneuroscience and physiology.\nI've talked before about the fact that\nwhen our eyes are directed upward,\nliterally when our eyelids are open,\nno surprise there, and when\nour eyes are directed upward,\nit creates a state of\nheightened alertness.\nAnd this has a relationship\nto the brainstem neurons\nthat create alertness and their control\nover the muscles of the eye and,\nbelieve it or not, the eyelids.\nNow, it's not the case that if\nyou are absolutely exhausted\nand you need to feel more alert\nthat looking upward is going\nto make you feel wide awake,\nalthough it will help support\nyour levels of alertness.\nThe point here is that you\ncan optimize your workstation\nin a physical way that\nleverages this aspect\nof the visual system and\nyour level of alertness.\nSince most of us want to be\nawake while we're working,\ntry and position your\nscreen or your tablet,\nwhatever device you\nhappen to be working on,\nat least at eye level and\nideally slightly higher.\nNow, if you think about it,\nmost people are not doing this.\nMost people are looking down\nat their computer or tablet\nor are angling their eyes at their screen\nat about 30 degrees.\nThat is not going to support\nheightened states of alertness\nand optimal attention.\nIn fact, the opposite relationship\nbetween eye position and\nalertness is also true.\nWhen we look down, when our\neyelids are slightly closed,\nit tends to decrease\nour levels of alertness\nand increase our levels of sleepiness.\nI really want to emphasize this,\nthat there's a bi-directional\nor reciprocal relationship\nbetween the brainstem areas\nthat control alertness and the eyes,\nmeaning how alert you are controls\nhow open or closed your\neyes are, no surprise there,\nbut also the how open and\nupward directed your eyes are\nwill increase your levels of alertness\nAnd if your eyes are pointed downward\nand your eyelids are hooded,\nlike they're slowly closing,\nlike Costello's are always are,\nyou'll feel more sleepy,\nespecially if you're somebody\nwho tends to have that\nmid-morning sleepiness\nor mid-morning crash.\nSo what I do is I have a standing desk,\nbut I also prop the computer up\nsuch that it's at least at eye level.\nAnd I haven't figured out yet\nhow to develop a workstation\nwhere the computer is above me.\nI think the only way to really do\nthat is actually to tilt one's body back,\nbut actually that's\nnot a good idea either.\nThey have done studies\nrecording from areas\nof the brain associated with alertness.\nAreas like locus coeruleus\nin the so-called reticular\nactivating system.\nWhat they found is that depending\non how reclined you\nare or upright you are,\nyou will decrease with reclining\nand increase with sitting\nforward your levels of alertness.\nSo body posture and\nwhether or not your upright\nor reclining will impact\nyour levels of alertness\nin the predictable ways.\nAnd where you position your eyes,\nwhether or not your eyes\nare upright, so to speak,\nlooking up or directly\nforward or looking down,\nwill dictate whether or not\nyou are feeling more alert\nor more sleepy, respectively.\nSo try and arrange a workstation\nor a position of your body in your chair\nor your standing desk, whatever it is,\nthat allows you to work\nwith a heightened state of alertness.\nThis is really, really key for me\nbecause I found that\nwhen I would sit down,\nnot only would my hip\nflexors start to get sore,\nI feel tight in the back, et cetera,\nbut if I was staring\ndown at my screen all day\nor even for short periods of the day,\nI would start to feel sleepy\nand I couldn't figure\nout what was going on.\nI also thought maybe I needed glasses.\nI do wear readers at night,\nbut it was really a problem.\nAnd simply by getting the screen directly\nin front of me at eye level,\nit's been completely transformative.\nSo we're now at the description of my day\nin these protocols in which I would do\na 90-minute about of work.\nNow, why 90 minutes?\nWell, the brain is going\nthrough these 90 minutes\nso-called \"ultradian cycles\"\nthroughout the entire day and night.\nEvery 90 minutes, we shift\nover from being very alert\nto being less alert, and\nthen back to alert again.\nHere's how it works.\nAt the start of one of these\n90 minute ultradian cycles,\nmy brain is not quite engaged\nin whatever it is I'm trying to do.\nOftentimes I have things\njumping into my mind,\nI've got distractions, et cetera.\nI'll talk about how to deal\nwith those distractions\nin a moment.\nBut I set a timer for 90 minutes\nand I try and get a strong\nabout of work done inside\nof that 90 minutes with\nthe full understanding\nthat the entire 90 minutes is not going\nto be uniform in terms\nof my ability to focus.\nThere will be kind of peaks\nand valleys within that,\nbut that 90 minutes is about\nwhat the brain can handle\nin terms of a dedicated effort\nfor high degree of focus.\nSome people can push out\na little bit further,\nsome people can't handle\nmore than 10 minutes,\nbut that's what I'm striving toward.\nYou'd be amazed how much you\ncan get done in 90 minutes\nif you are focused.\nSo how do you increase that focus\nand how do you use the timer feature?\nWell, you can combine those.\nI use a program called Freedom.\nIt shuts me out of the\ninternet completely.\nSo that means no checking the markets,\nno checking social media, no checking,\nyou know, the news, no\nchecking email, none of that.\nI get a dedicated about of work done.\nI confess, I don't allow\nmyself to go to the restroom\nin that period of time.\nHere's an interesting little tip\nthat's grounded in physiology.\nYou have a direct neural\nconnection from your bladder\nto your brainstem areas\nthat increase alertness.\nThis is why when you have\nto go to the bathroom,\nwhen you have to urinate, it\nis extremely agitating, right?\nIt can be very, very agitating.\nI'm not encouraging you to get\nso agitated by filling\nyour bladder so much\nand resisting going to the bathroom\nthat you are uncomfortable\nand can't focus,\nbut I generally will just drink liquids\nand work away and work away,\nand I won't walk away\nto go use the bathroom\nunless I absolutely have to.\nSort of odd that we're talking about this,\nbut this is one way in which I've learned\nto funnel my attention into\nwhatever it is I'm doing.\nBecause as you all know,\nthe moment you sit down\nto do some serious work\nand you flip off the internet,\nall of a sudden it's as\nif the phone has a voice,\nit starts calling you..\nIt's almost as if the\nrestroom has a voice.\nBut we all are familiar with the fact\nthat if we are focused on something\nthat all that just kind of melts away.\nSo the goal is to get into\nwhat I call the tunnel,\nto really get into a\ntunnel of quality work.\nThe brain loves that state,\nbut it's very hard for\nmany of us to access.\nMy phone is absolutely off.\nIt's not on airplane mode.\nIt's absolutely off during this time.\nIf I've been struggling with that and,\nI confess, you know, there are times when,\nfor whatever reason,\nsomething going on in life,\nit's been harder to put away the phone.\nI will sometimes put it in my car.\nI used to joke that I used\nto throw it up on the roof\nor something like that.\nLook, I've done and I suggest\npeople do whatever they need\nto in order to\nself-regulate that activity.\nAnd if you're somebody that\nfeels that you absolutely need\nto be on your phone and on the\ncomputer for this work about\nor the work that you do,\nwell, that's a different\nmatter altogether.\nThis is just simply how I work.\nSo I will do 90 minutes\nand I do set a timer\nand I turn on the program,\nFreedom locks me out of the internet.\nIf someone rings the doorbell,\nI will often shout,\n\"Not coming to the\ndoorbell. Leave it there.\"\nI mean, unless there's a real emergency,\nI'm not going to step away from that work.\nI learned how to do this\nwhen I was a graduate student\nunder different conditions\nwhere I used to slice brains\non what's called a microtome.\nSo I used to spend time,\njust cutting very thin slices,\nit's like a deli slicer, but for a brain,\nof various types of brains.\nAnd I've sectioned\nthrough a lot of brains.\nAnd we had a rule,\nwhich is that when the\nblade hits the brain,\nyou don't stop pulling, even\nthough it's very, very slow\neven if a nuclear bomb goes off,\neven if a fire alarm goes off.\nNow, I don't want anyone,\nyou know, burning to a crisp\nbecause they didn't step\naway from their workflow.\nThat would be foolish,\nbut that's the mentality\nthat I've embedded in myself,\nthat there's nothing more important\nthan what I'm doing in\nthat 90-minute block.\nAnd that's what works for me.\nYou can try various other things.\nThat's what works for me.\nIn addition, I use low level white noise.\nThis is something that is supported\nby quality, peer-reviewed data.\nWe covered this on the episode\non hearing and balance,\nbut it turns out that white noise,\nwhich is essentially all\nfrequencies of sound,\nor all frequencies of\nsound that we can perceive,\nmixed up kind of randomly,\nthere's no structure to it,\nturned on at a low volume,\nnot with headphones most of the time,\nputs the brain into a state that's optimal\nfor learning and workflow.\nAnd I covered two papers\nduring that episode.\nOne that showed that, indeed,\nbrain areas involved in attention,\nbrain areas involved in focus\nand cognition and memory,\nthose are engaged to a greater degree\nwhen there is low levels\nof white noise playing\nin the background.\nThe other paper that's really\ninteresting did brain imaging\nand showed the areas of the\nbrain that are associated\nwith dopamine release are increased\nby low levels of white noise.\nDopamine release is associated\nnot just with pleasure,\nbut with motivation and craving.\nSo everything about this 90-minute block\nfrom the low levels of white noise\nto the position of my computer,\nhow I'm standing, where\nmy eyes are positioned,\nis geared towards putting\nme in this tunnel of work.\nAnd I have to say that\nwhile it can be a challenge\nto try and achieve this state\nin this tunnel of work some days,\nyou start to get kind of addicted to it.\nIt feels really good.\nIt's like a workout for the mind.\nAnd it is something that as\nyou exit that 90 minutes,\nyou really feel like\nyou've accomplished a lot\nbecause often you have,\nand it just feels deeply satisfying.\nAnd I'm convinced that that's\nbecause of the release of\nneuromodulators like dopamine\nand the norepinephrine that's\ncirculating in your system.\nAnd I want to be clear\nthat I'm not perfect\nabout this 90 minutes.\nOccasionally I get drawn away.\nOccasionally something will happen\nor I'll go use the restroom\nor Costello will have a need\nor somebody will have a need\nthat I will have to respond to,\nbut I really try and achieve\nthis most, if not every day\nthat I'm alive because for me,\nthat work session is kind of holy.\nIt's where I set up a relationship,\nnot just between me and\nthe work that I'm doing,\nbut between me and my ability\nto control my own state of mind\nusing these various supports\nof the white noise, et cetera.\nBut really those supports are peripheral\nto the fact that I'm creating this space.\nI'm funneling my brain into a state\nrather than allowing\nwhatever events and contexts\non social media and\nelsewhere might be occurring\nin the world that would\nyank me out of what\nfor me is my purpose\nand my mission in life,\nwhich is to do the\nsorts of work that I do.\nThere's a powerful way in\nwhich you can place the timing\nof this 90-minute work\nabout in an optimal way.\nYou have access to a very\nimportant piece of data\nthat dictates when this about\nshould start more or less\nand when it should end.\nThat piece of data is\nyour temperature minimum.\nIf you're somebody who wakes\nup on average at 7:00 AM,\nwell, then your temperature\nminimum is 5:00 AM.\nAnd you can be reasonably sure,\nI want to underscore reasonably,\nbut you can be reasonably sure\nthat your best work is\ngoing to be done anywhere\nfrom four to six hours after\nyour temperature minimum.\nSo for me, I tend to\nwake up around 6:30 AM,\nthat means my temperature\nminimum is at 4:30 AM.\nYou can add five hours to that.\nSo that means that a 90\nminute work about could fall\nat 9:30 AM and it would\nbe fairly optimized.\nOr I could do it at 10:30 AM,\nor I could do it at 8:30 AM.\nSomewhere in there, all right?\nThat we can't say that\nit's exactly six hours\nafter your temperature minimum.\nYou will find it, however.\nThere is a precise and best time\nfor you to do this 90-minute work about.\nWhether or not it's five or six hours\nafter your temperature minimum is going\nto vary from person to person.\nHow do I know this?\nHow do I know this relationship\nbetween temperature minimum\nand focus cognition?\nWell, temperature minimum\ndefines the trough,\nthe nadir, as they say,\nof your temperature\nacross the 24-hour cycle.\nAnd immediately after that,\nyour temperature will start to rise.\nThat temperature rise is\nactually what triggers\nthe initial cortisol\nrelease that you experience\nand wakes you up further.\nAnd then, of course, that\nsunlight that you're getting\nis going to further enhance\nthat healthy release of cortisol.\nThat cortisol will then\nprovide fuel, if you will,\nfor that increase in temperature.\nAnd your body will continue\nto increase in temperature\nthroughout the day toward the afternoon.\nWhat you're trying to do in this idea\nof optimizing this 90-minute work about\nto a particular time of day\nis catch the portion of the steepest slope\nof that temperature rise.\nNow, again, you're not walking\naround with a thermocouple\nor a thermometer in some\norifice of your body.\nSo you don't have accurate\ninformation about temperature,\nbut you can make very good guesses\nabout when your body\ntemperature is rising fastest\nby virtue of that temperature minimum.\nSo again, just to be clear,\nit's a 90-minute work about.\nThat's about what the brain can handle\nfor a very intense work about.\nDo you understand, again,\nthat they're going to be\nportions of that 90 minute\nthat your brain is flickering\nin and out of focus,\nother portions, where you're\ngoing to be entirely focused.\nThat's entirely normal.\nBut when to place that\n90-minute work about,\nwhen to start it, and when\nto end it will depend on\nthat temperature minimum.\nSo if you're somebody who wakes\nup at 8:00 AM each morning,\nyour temperature minimum is 6:00 AM,\nchances are you're going to\nwant to start this work about\nsomewhere around 10:00 AM\nor 11:00 AM.\nNow, some people wake up and\nfeel very alert first thing\nin the morning.\nThey can really do their\nbest work first thing\nin the morning.\nPlease, if that's you continue to do that.\nLeverage that time. Use that time.\nBut if you're somebody who\nstruggles to find focus,\ndefinitely let your physiology\nand this rise in your body\ntemperature support your efforts\nto focus rather than\ntrying to do your best work\nat times of day when your physiology\nis actually directing your body\nand your brain toward de-focus\nand towards being more lethargic.\nIt just is setting yourself up for success\nwhen you try and capture this rising phase\nof your temperature.\nSo up until now,\nwe've been emphasizing practices\nthat allow you to optimize\nyour level of alertness\nand your levels of mental focus.\nData going back to the\n1990s supports the idea\nthat physical movement of particular kinds\ncan support brain health\nand brain function both\nin the immediate term\nand in the long term.\nNow, this is has had a profound impact\non the field of neuroscience, but frankly,\nit's also had a profound impact on\nhow I structure my day.\nSo after I've finished a about of work,\nthis 90-minute about of work,\nI force myself some days,\nother days I want to,\nbut I force myself to do some\nsort of physical exercise\nthat is going to be\nsupportive of my brain health\nand brain function and organ health\nand bodily function in general.\nSo I just briefly want to touch\non what the structure of\nthat exercise looks like,\nhow it's structured within the day\nand how it's structured\nacross the weeks in fact,\nbased on the scientific data\nand what the scientific data say is best\nor optimal in order to promote\nlongevity of the brain,\nability to focus, as well\nas cardiovascular health\nand all the other things that\nwe know exercise supports.\nNow, there are various\nforms of physical activity\nor what we call exercise,\nbut those can generally be\nbatched into two categories.\nFirst is strength and hypertrophy work.\nSo physical movements that are designed\nto make you stronger and/or\nmake your muscles larger.\nThere's also endurance work.\nPhysical exercise and\nmovements that are designed\nto allow you to do more work over time\nor to extend the amount of\ntime that you can do work\nof any kind, both physical and mental.\nAnd we did two full podcast\nepisodes on the details\nand the science and the protocols\nrelated to these topics.\nWe did an episode on\nthe science of strength\nand hypertrophy, of building\nstrength and muscle building.\nAnd that included a lot of protocols.\nAnd we did an episode on endurance.\nHow to build any one or all of\nthe four types of endurance,\nwhich are muscular endurance,\nanaerobic, aerobic,\nlong-distance endurance, et cetera.\nSo if you're interested in the\nspecifics of those protocols,\nplease see those episodes.\nHowever, right now I\njust want to emphasize\nhow the data impact my day\nand how I structure my day in a way\nthat I can incorporate physical movement\nin a way that supports\nmy brain and health.\nBasically, after I finished\nthat cognitive work about,\nthat 90-minute work about,\nI do some form of physical\nexercise for about an hour.\nThe data all point to the\nfact that working out hard\nfor longer than an hour\ncan actually be detrimental\nbecause of the way that\nit raises cortisol.\nAnd cortisol can be a good thing\nif it's appropriately timed\nand in the appropriate low levels,\nbut you don't want to have\nyour cortisol levels up\nthroughout the day or have big spikes\nof cortisol repeatedly.\nSo keeping workouts relatively short\ncan definitely help with that\nAnd certainly if you're training hard,\n60 minutes or less should\nbe more than sufficient.\nAnd for many people, including myself,\n45 minutes or 50 minutes is\nprobably even more optimal.\nThe basic design of this\nphysical exercise is\nthat it be approximately 60 minutes.\nSo maybe 60 plus or minus\n15 minutes should be well\nwithin the margins of keeping\nhormonal health proper\nand not going too long\nnor making the workout\nso short that it's not beneficial.\nAnd essentially what the data tell us is\nthat in order to optimize cardiovascular\nand brain health and\nother systems of the body,\nwe want to exercise at\nleast five days per week.\nI know that seems like a lot.\nIt certainly is a lot for certain people.\nSome of you, you compulsive exercisers,\nmight gasp at the idea\nof taking two days off.\nI personally find that taking\ntwo full days off per week\nis actually both beneficial\nto my exercise training performance,\nas well as pleasant.\nI like those rest days.\nBut essentially the structure\nof the exercise regimen\nthat works for sake of\nsupporting health is going\nto be one in which there's a 3:2 ratio.\nWhere for a 12-week period\nor so, maybe 10 to 12 weeks,\nthree of those five workouts\nper week emphasize strength\nand hypertrophy and the other\ntwo emphasize endurance.\nThen, after 10 or 12 weeks,\none over to a 10- or 12-week\nregimen of doing a 3:2 ratio\nwhere you're prioritizing endurance work.\nSo primarily the sorts of\nworkouts that are described\nin the endurance episode\nand those protocols.\nAnd the other two days,\nyou're focusing on strength\nand hypertrophy work merely\nto maintain strength and hypertrophy,\nto not lose the strength and hypertrophy\nthat you've created.\nAnd there a lot of data\nnow supporting the fact\nthat maintaining muscular health\nand bone health is supported\nby resistance training,\nweight training of various kinds.\nIt can also be done with body weight\nif you don't have access to equipment.\nAnd, of course, that doing\ncardiovascular endurance work\nis very beneficial both to\nthe muscles of the body,\nthe organs of the body,\nbut also to the brain.\nMany of you have probably heard\nthat doing physical exercise\nof various kinds can\nsupport the production\nof new neurons in the brain.\nFrankly, those data are\nspecific to research animals.\nAs far as we know,\nincreases in neuron\nnumber are not supported\nby exercise in humans.\nThere is a little bit\nof data that supports\nthat maybe a few neurons\nmight get created by running\nor weightlifting or things\nof that sort in human beings,\nbut there's still a host of other reasons\nto have this hour or so per day\nwhere one is doing physical exercise.\nAnd those include increased\nblood flow to the brain.\nRemember, the brain is an organ too.\nIt's the most metabolically\ndemanding organ in your body\nand it's receiving\nthose metabolic factors,\nit's receiving its fuels\nby way of vasculature,\nof blood vessels and capillaries and veins\nand things of that sort.\nSo movement is very crucial\nto get your brain to function properly.\nMovement of various\nkinds is very important\nto get your brain to function properly.\nResistance training turns\nout to be as important\nas endurance training because of the way\nthat it stimulates the release\nof particular hormones\nactually from bones,\nthings like osteocalcin,\nwhich can positively impact brain function\nand can support the\nhealth of existing neurons\nas opposed to increasing\nthe number of neurons.\nIt turns out increasing the number\nof neurons may not actually\nbe as beneficial as we think.\nIt all sounds great. More\nneurons, more neurons.\nCertainly more neurons is\nbetter than fewer neurons\nand losing neurons,\nbut incorporating new neurons\ninto existing brain circuitry\nis actually very challenging\nfor the brain to do.\nI make sure that after that workout,\nI get this one hour or so of\nexercise five days per week\nbecause of the ways that it\nsupports my general health.\nAnd there are now hundreds of\nstudies supporting the fact\nthat both endurance work\nand strength training\nor hypertrophy training\ndone in combination,\nmeaning not necessarily\nin the same workout,\nbut done across the week\nis immensely beneficial\nfor the production of things\nlike brain-derived neurotrophic factor,\nfor limiting inflammatory\ncytokines like IL-6,\nfor promoting anti-inflammatory\ncytokines like IL-10,\nprovided that exercise\nis of the proper duration\nand that it's not so intense\nthat you're actually creating damage\nto the various systems of the body.\nNow, where is the\nthreshold between optimal,\nsub-threshold and detrimental?\nThis is a complicated theme\nif we don't put some structure around it.\nSo let's put a little bit\nof structure around it.\nWe already said that about 60 minutes,\nso 60 minutes plus or minus 15 minutes,\nis going to be optimal for\nall these health benefits.\nWhat about the structure\nof the actual workouts?\nWell, we need to address\nthis issue of intensity.\nA good rule of thumb\nbased on the literature,\nand I discussed this with\nDr. Andy Galpin prior\nto this strength and hypertrophy\nand endurance episodes,\nand the literature that's published in\nquality, peer-reviewed\njournals really points\nto the fact that approximately 80%\nof the resistance training you do\nshould be resistance training\nthat doesn't go to what they call failure,\nwhere you can't actually\nmove the resistance anymore.\nThe other 20% can be\nof the higher intensity\nto failure type training.\nNow, with respect to endurance work,\none can build up endurance\nwithout having to log long,\nlong mileage or extensive mileage\nin the pool or by running.\nAnd that's because there\nare these other forms\nof endurance that can build up,\nfor instance, the capillary\nbeds within the muscles.\nBuilding up the capillary beds\nwithin the muscles will\nallow more oxygen utilization\nwithin the muscles,\nand thereby will increase your endurance\nboth of the muscles,\nbut also will improve brain metabolism\nand the way that the heart functions,\nso cardiovascular function.\nThat 80/20 rule of less than failure\nand work to failure in the\nresistance exercise regime\ncan be transported or translated\nto the endurance exercise portion\nby focusing on that thing\nthat we're familiar with,\nwhich is the burn when we're\nrunning hard or cycling hard,\nwe'll experience a kind\nof burning of the muscles\nthat's associated with the lactate system.\nDuring the episode on endurance,\nI pointed out that that\nburn is not lactic acid.\nContrary to common belief,\nit is not lactic acid.\nIt's associated with lactate metabolism.\nAnd again, about 80% of the endurance work\nshould not incorporate\nthat so-called \"burn,\"\nbut if 20% of that work or so,\nI should say approximately\n20% of that work,\ndoes include the so-called\n\"burning sensation,\"\nthat burning sensation actually\ntriggers the activation\nof release of certain compounds\nand molecules from glia,\nthis brain cell type that\nsupports neuron health.\nAnd actually, the lactate\nsystem is its own form of fuel\nfor the brain.\nAnd so there's increasing\ninterest in generating the lactate\nor pushing past that lactate\nthreshold for small portion,\n20% or so, of endurance work in order\nto support brain health and function.\nSo what does all this all\nlook like as a protocol?\nWell, as I mentioned\nbefore, this 3:2 ratio.\nSo maybe you spend 10 weeks or so\nor 12 weeks or so focusing\nmainly on endurance,\nwhere three workouts per\nweek on endurance work,\n80% of those workouts,\nmeaning 80% of the time you're\nbelow that burn threshold,\nyou are not experiencing\na burning sensation,\nbut that for 20% of it, you are.\nThat, based on the scientific data,\nshould support lactate metabolism,\nbrain health, et cetera,\nas well as cardiovascular\nhealth and oxygen utilization.\nAll the forms of endurance\nthat we're aware of.\nAnd then the other two workouts\nwould involve resistance training,\nagain, with this 80/20 split,\nwhere 80% of the work is\nnot to failure and 20% is.\nAnd then maybe after 10,\n12 weeks, you switch,\nwhere you start emphasizing\nstrength and hypertrophy work\nfor three of the workouts\nand endurance work for\ntwo of the workouts.\nNow, of course, some of you will be able\nto train six days a week\nor you'll compulsively need\nto train seven days a week.\nIf you decide to do that,\nplease be aware that\nthis cortisol threshold\nis a real thing.\nSo for me, the 3:2 ratio\nworks out perfectly\n'cause I like two full days off a week.\nWhen I take those really depends\non my schedule and how I'm feeling.\nSometimes it's two days in a row.\nSometimes they're interspersed\nthroughout the week.\nBut in reviewing the scientific literature\nfor those two episodes of the podcast\nand in talking to people\nwho are really informed\nin the world of resistance training\nand endurance training\nand how that relates to\nbrain health and body health,\nthis seems to be the most\nrational and grounded protocol,\nso that's the one that I follow.\nSo on any given day,\nI finish that work block and I train.\nI do some sort of resistance\nor endurance training.\nI put those on alternate days\nor different days, rather.\nSo we've now talked about the arc\nthat spans all the way from waking\nto a morning about of focused work\nto physical training.\nI have not mentioned ingesting\nanything or nutrients.\nOne of the most common questions I get\nare what should I eat for my brain?\nWell, ironically enough,\none of the best things you can do\nfor your brain is to not eat,\nbut, of course, we all\nhave to eat sooner or later\nand eating is wonderful.\nI absolutely love eating.\nI even enjoy the mere act of chewing.\nBut the question of what\nto eat is an important one\nas it relates to brain\nhealth and brain function.\nBefore we talk about that,\nI want to emphasize that\ntraining fasted actually\nhas some immediate and long-term benefits.\nPrior to having my lab at Stanford,\nI was down in San Diego at UC San Diego\nand had an appointment\nat the Salk Institute\nof Biological Studies.\nI had a colleague there by\nthe name of Satchin Panda.\nHe wrote a wonderful book\ncalled \"The Circadian Code.\"\nHe runs a serious biology\nlaboratory focusing on metabolism,\ncircadian rhythms, and so forth,\nas well as the effects of fasting.\nSatchin and his book \"The\nCircadian Code\" describe\nhow engaging in physical exercise\nwhile fasted can amplify the\neffects of that exercise,\nnot just for sake of increasing\nthe percentage of things\nlike body fat burned, et\ncetera, but for cellular health,\nliver health, and the\nhealth of other organs.\nSo where possible, I do\nstrive to do my workout\nwithout eating anything first.\nHowever, some days I'm very, very hungry,\nand so I do ingest water,\nwhich contains electrolytes,\nso that means sodium,\nmagnesium, potassium,\nfor the simple reason\nthat sodium, magnesium,\npotassium are required for\nneurons to function properly.\nIt's part of the way they\ngenerate electrical activity.\nAs well, Ingesting electrolytes\nfor me can quell hunger.\nAnd this points to a whole other topic\nwe could do another\nepisode on at some point,\nwhich is many times people will think\nthat their blood sugar is low\nand actually that's not the case.\nAnd frankly, one wouldn't want\ntheir blood sugar to be high.\nYou don't want your blood sugar too low,\nbut you also don't want it too high.\nVery low blood sugar is terrible,\nbut lowish blood sugar tends\nto give us a sense of\nmental clarity and focus,\nrelated to this adrenaline phenomenon\nthat we talked about earlier.\nIn order to be able to focus on exercise\nor work or anything else, you\nneed sufficient electrolytes.\nAnd so many people find that\nif they simply ingest\nsome water with salt,\nmaybe a 99-milligram potassium tablet,\nall of a sudden they\nfeel very mentally clear\nand able to do physical\nwork and mental work.\nSo what I do is, prior\nto this morning exercise,\nalthough it's now late morning\nin this way I'm describing it\nand typically it does occur late morning,\nI'll have some water with\neither maybe half a teaspoon of sea salt\nwith a 99-milligram potassium tablet\nor these days I'm fond of\ntaking what's called \"LMNT.\"\nL-M-N-T. LMNT.\nI learned about this from\nLex Friedman's podcasts.\nI know many of you are familiar with Lex,\nhas a excellent podcast,\nexcellent scientist.\nI don't have any business\nrelationship to LMNT.\nThey're not a sponsor of the podcast,\nbut LMNT is a product\nthat essentially contains electrolytes:\nsodium, potassium, as\nwell as magnesium malate,\nwhich has been shown to offset things\nlike delayed onset muscle soreness.\nThat form of magnesium\ndoesn't make people drowsy.\nIt's not an anxiolytic like\nsome other forms of magnesium.\nAn anxiolytic is just\none that reduces anxiety.\nSo whether or not it's LMNT\nor whether or not you're\njust putting a little bit\nof salt into some water\nand ingesting that prior\nto training, that can be\nan excellent way to ensure\nthat you're able to complete\nthe physical exercise,\neven though you haven't eaten anything.\nAnd I confess, some days\nI will eat a little bit\nbefore my workout,\njust because I can't\nseem to resist eating.\nI want to mention the use of stimulants\nbefore physical training.\nThis has certain benefits\nand certain drawbacks.\nThe benefits are sometimes\nit can facilitate motivation\nbecause things like caffeine can increase\nthe release of dopamine,\ncan increase the release of epinephrin,\ncan reduce that adenosine\nlevel in the bloodstream.\nSo some people use\ncaffeine before training\nin ways that benefit them.\nIt can also increase fat oxidation\nand kind of fat metabolism and\nthings if that's your goal.\nI'm not a particular fan\nof ingesting stimulants\nbefore training because of a whole set\nof problems associated with\nmost forms of stimulants\nin the form of energy drinks, et cetera.\nI am not a fan of energy drinks.\nI did a decent portion\nof a previous episode\non food and mood on energy drinks\nand some of the detrimental\nthings they contain.\nRather, I try and train simply\nby ingesting the caffeine\nsources I mentioned before,\nguayusa, mate, some\nelectrolytes, some water.\nOccasionally I'll have an espresso\nor a cup of coffee before I train.\nAnd on rare occasions,\nI should emphasize rare occasions,\nif I really need help\nincreasing my motivation\nor I decide I want to push extremely hard,\nI will ingest something like alpha-GPC.\nAlpha-GPC supports the release\nof a neuromodulator called acetylcholine.\nSo 300 milligrams of\nalpha-GPC has been shown\nto increase physical performance,\nbut also cognitive performance.\nSome people might not be\ninterested in ingesting anything\nto improve their physical\nperformance or anything at all,\nbut they might be addressing\nhow they can improve cognitive\nperformance and focus.\nAnd alpha-GPC is a non-stimulant\nway to approach that.\nAgain, definitely check with your doctor\nbefore taking anything or\nstopping to take anything,\nbut alpha-GPC has been\nshown in various studies\nto improve cognitive performance.\nAnd in people who have\nage-related cognitive decline,\nthere have been some\npositive benefits reported\nin quality, peer-reviewed journals.\nIf you want to explore those references,\nplease go to examine.com,\ngo please put in alpha-GPC,\ngo to the Human Effect Matrix,\nand there you can find\ndetails of those studies,\nreferences to PubMed, et cetera.\nSo let's talk about food timing first.\nAs I mentioned, I eat\nmy first meal sometime\naround noon plus or minus an hour\nfor the reasons we've discussed.\nThe volume of food is also important.\nIf you eat a large volume of anything,\nbecause it diverts blood to your gut,\nyou will feel lethargic\nand you will have less\nblood going to your brain.\nThat seems like a simple and trivial fact,\nbut if you want be able to think,\nyou can't ingest large volumes\nof anything into your gut.\nSo the discussion about\nwhat foods give you energy\nis kind of moot if you eat\nenormous volumes of that food.\nNow, the volumes are\ngoing to depend on you\nand your needs and your activity levels.\nI'm going to discuss what I\ndo in terms of food content,\nbut I'm not going to discuss food volume.\nI sort of know where that mostly full,\nlike 80% full line is,\nand I usually eat a little\nbit past that, frankly.\nAnd I'm able to maintain a decent degree\nof alertness into the afternoon.\nAnd that's my goal\nand I think that's the\ngoal of most people,\nto not work out in the\nmorning or do some work,\nand then just collapse into a slumber\nthat lasts all afternoon,\nbut to be able to generate alert, calm,\nfocus states throughout the day.\nSo for lunch, I do emphasize\nslightly lower carbohydrate\nor low carbohydrate intake\nfor the simple reason\nthat adrenaline and dopamine\nand their associated\nneuromodulators are going\nto support alertness.\nSo for me, I fast up until about noon.\nThen I eat a lunch that consists\nof some sort of protein thing,\nlike some meat or some\nchicken or some salmon\nand some vegetables, et cetera.\nAnd if I've exercised previously,\nwhich I do, as I mentioned,\nfive days a week,\nthen I will ingest some starches.\nI'll in just some red\nor, bread, excuse me,\nor rice or oatmeal and butter\nand nuts and things like that.\nI will consume the various\nfood groups, as they say,\nbut I will keep the total amount\nof carbohydrate a little\nbit on the low side,\nor if I haven't trained,\nI won't have any carbohydrate at all.\nNot because I'm ketogenic,\nnot because I'm inter carbohydrate,\nnot because I'm on a pure\ncarnivore diet, far from it,\nbut because starches cause\nthe release of serotonin\nin the brain and lend themselves\nto a state of sleepiness.\nNow, I should mention that\nabout 25% of individuals\nhave genes that encode for enzymes\nthat allow them to eat large\namounts of carbohydrate\nand not suffer from this lethargy,\nthis kind of sedation from carbohydrates.\nBut I don't have that gene, and so for me,\neating a noonish meal\nthat is not enormous,\nbut is decent in size, but\nthat is mainly protein,\nhealthy fats, and lowish carbohydrates\nor no carbohydrates is what allows me\nto achieve heightened states of alertness\nthroughout the day, which is\nwhat I need for my purposes.\nSo just knowing that meats\nand nuts support alertness,\nprovided you don't eat too much of them,\nthat vegetables are healthy for us\nand therefore we should eat them,\nand I happen to like them as well,\nand that carbohydrates tend\nto have a kind of sedative\nlike quality to them,\nthat should help you and\nguide your food choices\nin an intelligent way that's grounded\nin the scientific literature\nas it relates to alertness.\nNow, what about components of foods\nthat are not about alertness,\nbut are about mood?\nWe did an entire episode on mood and food,\nand it's very clear, based\non now dozens of studies,\nthat ingesting sufficient\nlevels of omega-3 fatty acids\nis going to support healthy mood\nand even can act as an antidepressant.\nMore than a dozen studies have shown\nthat ingesting at least\n1,000 milligrams per day\nof the EPA form of essential fatty acid\nis as effective as\nprescription antidepressants\nin relieving depression.\nAnd if you're somebody\nwho requires prescription antidepressants,\nProzac, Zoloft, et cetera,\nit can allow people to take lower doses\nof those medications,\nwhich in many cases is a positive thing\nor a good thing to do because\nof the side effect profiles\nthat many of those drugs carry.\nSo I find these data\nremarkably compelling.\nI mean, here we have a food\nor a substance from food\nthat can improve our mood\nand our sense of wellbeing,\nand it does that by way\nof increasing certain\nneuromodulators in the brain,\nin particular dopamine,\nbut also some other\nrelated neuromodulators.\nSo if you're eating\nfatty salmon regularly,\nif you're eating krill regularly,\nmeaning if you're a whale,\nif you're ingesting foods that tend\nto have a lot of omega-3s,\nyou probably don't need to\nsupplement with omega-3.\nMost people are not\ningesting sufficient levels\nof omega-3, and I'm certainly\none of those people.\nDespite an effort to eat\ngood foods and whole foods,\net cetera, and unprocessed foods,\nI've made the choice to ingest\nat least 1,000 milligrams per day of EPA.\nI do that in the form of fish oil\nand the EPA-DHA combination fish oil,\nbut the threshold of 1,000 milligrams\nis not 1,000 milligrams of fish oil;\nit's 1,000 milligrams of EPA.\nNow, for those of you that\ndon't want to consume fish oils\nand prefer to get your omega-3s\nfrom non-animal sources,\nthere are non-animal sources,\nvarious forms of algae, et cetera.\nYou can just look that up online\nand you should be able to find that.\nThere are also a number of foods\nthat include these essential omega-3s.\nWe did an episode on food and mood\nwhere I go into more detail\nthan you could ever want on that,\nas well as some additional\nrecommendations.\nWe also did an episode\non thyroid function,\nthis hormone that's\nimportant for metabolism,\nand that pointed to the importance\nof getting sufficient iodine,\nwhich you should naturally get\nfrom the salts you're ingesting,\nprovided you're ingesting enough salt.\nI'm not somebody who eats a lot of kelp,\nbut, or seaweed, although I\ndon't mind the taste of seaweed,\nI don't ingest it regularly,\nbut ingesting sufficient selenium\nor selenium has been shown to be important\nfor proper thyroid production\nand thyroid function,\nwhich is why I tend to eat\na few Brazil nuts each day\ntypically with my lunch or\nsometimes before my workout.\nIt doesn't really matter.\nThe point is that the volume, the amount,\nthe content, and indeed the\nratios of protein to fat\nto carbohydrates are going\nto impact how you feel\nand they're going to\nimpact your brain health.\nAnd, of course, the timing.\nWe know that allowing periods of 12 hours\nor more each 24-hour cycle\nwhere you're not ingesting\nanything is beneficial\nfor your brain and body health.\nThat's what Satchin Panda\nand his colleagues' work has\nshown over and over again\nin these quality studies.\nSo when people ask me, you know,\n\"What should I eat for my brain?\"\nMore often than not,\nit's really a question of how\nyou're structuring your day,\nwhen you're eating for the first time,\nhow long you're allowing yourself\nto fast each 24-hour cycle,\nand also whether or not you're\ngetting sufficient omega-3s,\nwhether or not you're\ngetting sufficient selenium\nto support things like thyroid function,\nwhich has an impact both on\nthe metabolism of the body,\nbut also the metabolism in the brain.\nAnd when I say metabolism,\nI don't just mean burning energy;\nI actually mean the rebuilding of things.\nSo in the episode on growth\nhormone and thyroid hormone,\nwe talked about how metabolism means,\nnot just the breakdown of\nfats and carbohydrates,\nbut also the building up,\nthe repair of muscle tissue,\nthe repair of bone,\nthe reinforcing of bone\nand the repair and the\nbuildup of brain tissue.\nAnd so those are the\nthings that I emphasize\nbecause they are so strongly supported\nby the scientific data\ndone in mice studies,\ndone in humans.\nAnd basically there's a\nlot of biochemical evidence\nthat supports everything\nthat I just described.\nAlong the lines of health and wellbeing,\nI'd be remiss if I\ndidn't mention hormones.\nHormones have broad effects\non the body and brain.\nWe did an entire month on hormones\nif you want to hear about any\nof those hormones in detail.\nWe talked about testosterone\nand optimizing testosterone,\nestrogen, et cetera.\nThe sex steroid hormones,\nwhich include testosterone and estrogen,\nwhich, of course, are\npresent in varying ratios,\nbut in both men and women and in kids,\nthey are manufactured from cholesterol.\nWe hear about cholesterol\nas this terrible thing,\nbut they are actually\nmade from cholesterol.\nAnd so if you don't get\nsufficient levels of cholesterol,\nthat can be problematic for your hormones\nand that can be problematic for your brain\nand your body health.\nSo without going into too much detail,\nI'll just point to a couple of things\nthat I do that, at\nleast from my blood work\nand from my subjective experience,\nhave been very beneficial for me\nthat some of you might want to consider.\nFirst of all, I am not shy\nabout my love for butter.\nI will eat packs of butter directly.\nI believe if people\nare going to eat cheese\nwithout a cracker, I will\neat butter without a cracker.\nButter is high in cholesterol,\nso I don't eat a ton of it,\nbut at least for me and for\nmy lipid profiles, it's fine.\nButter has cholesterol,\nwhich is a precursor to\nthe sex steroid hormones,\nand men and women need\ntestosterone and estrogen\nin order to feel good\nand to be able to think.\nYou do not want your estrogen too low\nor your testosterone too low.\nSo I eat butter in order to ensure\nthat I get sufficient cholesterol.\nButter also has some other\nthings that are beneficial,\nvarious small fatty acids that are\nthat are interesting in\nterms of their effects\non metabolism, et cetera.\nYou can look those up, benefits of butter.\nBut again, volume is important\nand you can't overdo it.\nCostello incidentally\nloves butter as well.\nAlong the lines of\nhormones and testosterone,\nI get a lot of questions\nabout this I think\nbecause a lot of online communities\nare sort of obsessed with testosterone,\nand I just want to emphasize that, yes,\nhaving sufficient levels of testosterone\nis vitally important for brain function\nand having sufficient levels\nof estrogen will allow your\nbrain to actually function.\nIt turns out that estrogen\nis one of the main ways\nin which the brain maintains longevity\nand maintains its ability to think.\nSo we should all be seeking\noptimal testosterone levels\nfor ourselves, both\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nAnd many of the things that\nwe've discussed up until now,\nmorning sunlight, exercise, fasting,\nthose can support\ntestosterone and estrogen\nin meaningful and positive ways.\nI get a lot of questions\nabout hormone optimization.\nWe did an entire month on this topic.\nWe did an entire episode on testosterone\nand estrogen optimization.\nI just want to briefly\nhighlight two things\nthat could be relevant,\nand then if you want more details,\nplease go see that episode.\nThe first is that testosterone\ncan exert its various functions only\nin its unbound form, free testosterone.\nWe all make a particular binding protein\ncalled \"sex hormone binding globulin\"\nthat essentially binds up testosterone,\nprevents it from being free.\nThis sounds like a terrible thing,\nbut actually it's a good thing\nbecause it allows\ntestosterone be transported\nto the various tissues,\nincluding the brain,\nwhere it can exert its various functions.\nFor those that have lower\nthan desired levels of testosterone\nor too much sex hormone binding globulin,\nit turns out that 400 milligrams per day\nof something called \"tongkat ali,\"\nwhich is a form of ginseng,\ncan actually help increase\nlevels of free testosterone.\nMany people experience a\npositive subjective effect\nand some objective affects as well,\nmeaning increases in free testosterone\nwhen they do blood analysis.\nThere are some data on that,\nnot a ton in the\npeer-reviewed literatures,\nand again, always approach\nthese with a sense of caution\nand definitely talked to your doctor.\nIf you want to learn more about that,\nyou can go to examine.com.\nThere's a lot of information\nthere listed about that.\nThe other compound that's\nrelevant both to men and women,\nor I should say people that are trying\nto optimize testosterone\nand/or estrogen, is Fadogia.\nFadogia agrestis is actually an herb\nthat increases the levels\nof what's called \"luteinizing hormone.\"\nLuteinizing hormone is a hormone\nthat's released from the hypothalamus\nwithin the brain that\ntravels to the gonads,\neither the ovaries or the testes,\nto stimulate the release of\nestrogen or testosterone.\nAnd Fadogia agrestis has been shown,\nalbeit in a limited number of studies,\nto increase levels of luteinizing hormone\nand thereby levels of\ntestosterone and estrogen\nin ways that some people find beneficial.\nSo I just want to mention those two.\nAnd again, if you want\na lot more information\nabout hormone optimization,\nplease see the episodes\non hormone optimization.\nA key aspect to the mid-day meal,\nif you want that meal to benefit you,\nis to take a brief walk afterwards.\nIt turns out that brief\nwalks of five to 30 minutes\nafter ingesting food can\naccelerate metabolism\nand actually can accelerate\nand improve nutrient utilization,\nwhich is essentially\nthe same as metabolism.\nBut nonetheless, that's\nsomething that I do\nafter I finish my noon meal.\nI do force myself to\nstand up and go outside\nand take a brief walk.\nThat also gets me, again, into optic flow.\nIt also has another benefit,\nwhich is that I am giving my brain\nand thereby my body more information\nabout light and time of day,\nwhich is always better\nthan less information\nabout light and time of day.\nMuch of our circadian rhythm\nand our health rhythms\nand all of our cognitive\nrhythms, et cetera,\nare supported by our cells\nknowing where they are in time,\nand light is the primary zeitgeber,\nthat's German for \"timekeeper,\"\nis the primary way in which\nthe body learns information\nor about what function should be turned on\nand what functions should be turned off.\nSo getting that morning light pulse,\nbut then also leaving the house\nor apartment or workplace and getting out\nfor a few minutes after lunch\nis beneficial for metabolism,\nbeneficial for nutrient utilization,\nand beneficial for all the\norgans and tissues of the body\nbecause you're getting that\noutside light exposure.\nNow I'd like to shift our attention\ntowards science supported-protocols\nthat increase the effectiveness\nand our performance in everything.\nAnd by everything I mean sleep,\nI mean physical performance,\nI mean mental performance,\nI mean less anxiety, all the things.\nTruly all the things.\nAnd that is something called\n\"non-sleep deep rest.\"\nNon-sleep deep rest or NSDR\nis an acronym that I coined\nas an umbrella term to\nencompass many protocols\nthat all have been shown,\nin one form or another,\nto support better brain and body function.\nNow, these protocols have\nnames that you've heard before.\nThings like meditation,\nthings like yoga nidra,\nand things like hypnosis.\nAll of these protocols and\nthese activities, however,\nshare something in common,\nwhich is they involve a deliberate\nand directed shift in one's state,\nand the shift tends to be\ntoward a state of deeper relaxation.\nWe certainly don't have time now\nto dissect out the\nliterature on all of these.\nThere is ample literature,\nI should say there is\nrobust and ample literature,\nsupporting the fact that\na regular meditation\npractice is beneficial.\nBut meditation itself has many forms:\ntranscendental meditation,\nloving kindness meditation,\nthird eye meditation, walking meditation.\nYoga nidra is a practice I've talked\nabout many times before,\nwhich involves simply lying down.\nIt doesn't involve any movement.\nNo down dogs or up dogs or anything.\nIt just involves lying on your back\nand doing some specific\nlong exhale breathing.\nThere are a lot of yoga\nnidra scripts out there\nthat are quite good.\nBut there's one NSDR type protocol\nthat has been shown by the greatest number\nof scientific studies to promote\nnot just states of deep relaxation,\nnot just states of heightened focus,\nbut also to accelerate plasticity\nand learning within the\nbrain, and that's hypnosis.\nAnd I've become increasingly excited\nand interested in hypnosis as a tool,\nand not just a tool of any kind,\nbut a tool that really can be directed\ntoward particular goals and outcomes.\nAnd I think that's really\nwhat sets hypnosis apart\nas an NSDR, non-sleep deep rest, protocol\nfrom things like naps or\nthings like yoga nidra\nor things like meditation.\nAnd I certainly believe and understand\nthat meditation naps and\nyoga nidra can be directed\ntoward less anxiety, et cetera,\nbut hypnosis is unique in\nthat it's very directed.\nThe essence of hypnosis\nis for the person, you,\nto guide your brain toward a\nparticular outcome or change.\nSo I'd like to point out\na particular resource.\nIt's a completely zero-cost resource,\nwhich is reveri.com.\nThat's R-E-V-E-R-I.com.\nreveri.com obviously is a website\nwhere there are links to\nan app that's available\nin Apple and Android.\nThis is a hypnosis app,\nbut this isn't just any hypnosis app.\nThis is a hypnosis app\nthat contains multiple hypnosis protocols\nthat are all backed by\nvery high-quality science.\nThe science was done by my colleague\nand our associate chair of psychiatry\nat Stanford School of Medicine,\nthat David Spiegel is\nresponsible for that work.\nI'm not associated with\nthat scientific work.\nThey've examined what brain areas\nget activated during hypnosis,\nwhat the outcomes are for\nvarious hypnosis protocols.\nAnd within Reveri,\nyou will find hypnosis protocols\nfor enhancing your focus,\nenhancing creativity, reducing pain,\ngetting better at\nsleeping, reducing anxiety.\nMost of these are about\n10 or 15 minutes long.\nSome of them are extremely brief.\nOne minute long.\nThey have a one-minute\nhypnosis that you can do.\nThose one minute hypnosis\nscripts work best\nif you've been doing the 10\nand 15 minute ones\nregularly or semi-regularly.\nIt's a really wonderful resource\nfor which there is a lot of\npeer-reviewed published data.\nOne study I'd like to emphasize\nin particular is Jiang et al.\nJ-I-A-N-G.\nThat is a reference you can find\non the reveri.com website\nunder Our Research.\nAnd the title of this\npaper is \"Brain Activity\nand Functional Connectivity\nAssociated with Hypnosis,\"\nand it was published in the\njournal Cerebral Cortex.\nWhat this paper essentially\nshows is that specific areas\nof our brain that are involved\nin executive function,\nwhich is associated with\nour ability to focus,\nas well as what's called\nthe \"default mode network,\"\nwhich is sort of the way\nthat your brain idles,\ndoes your brain tend to idle\nat a level of high anxiety or calm,\nas well as activation of\na brain area called the \"insula.\"\nThat's I-N-S-U-L-A.\nThe insula is extremely interesting.\nHypnosis has been shown\nto activate the insula,\nwhich can enhance our\nsense of interoception,\nour sense of internal state,\nwhich might sound like a annoying thing.\nYou don't want to be\nthinking about your heartbeat\nor your breathing.\nBut what's really\ninteresting about hypnosis is\nthat it increases areas of the brain\nthat are responsible for\ndeep relaxation, focus,\nand self-awareness, this\ninteroception, simultaneously.\nAnd that's very unusual\ncompared to other states,\nany other states of any kind.\nSo I've made it a practice,\na daily practice in fact,\nthat after lunch and after this walk,\nI do a brief 10-minute hypnosis script\nbecause what I've found is\nthat in contrast to naps\nand in contrast to other forms of NSDR,\nit really allows me to enter\na state of deep relaxation,\nbut also to then exit that state\nin a very focused and deliberate way\nthat allows me to lean into\nmy afternoon in an alert way,\nin a way that I can\nfunction and do mental work\nand interact with people, et cetera.\nSo there's no brain fog,\nthere's no grogginess.\nAnd I want to emphasize that the hypnosis\nthat I'm referring to here\nand that Reveri provides\nis not stage hypnosis.\nThis isn't you being programmed\nto squawk like a chicken\nor do anything against your will.\nThis is you teaching your brain\nhow to access these focused,\nrelaxed, interoceptive states.\nThis is also an extremely\nvaluable aspect to hypnosis\nbecause it can increase plasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nIt's essentially opening\nup pathways that allow you\nto change your brain in\nthe ways that you want.\nAnd it's very directed\ntoward particular outcomes\nSo I am an, as you can probably tell,\nI'm very enthusiastic about hypnosis\nas an optimal NSDR protocol,\nand so I do that every single day.\nThere are days that I\ndon't manage to do it\nfor whatever reason.\nI forget or interference\nfrom email or et cetera.\nBut that is essentially how\nI enter my early afternoon.\nI do this post-lunch, post-walk NSDR\nin the form of a Reveri hypnosis.\nAgain, a completely\nzero-cost resource to you.\nThere are excellent data.\nAll those data can be\nfound on the Reveri site,\nand you can also learn a\nlot more about hypnosis\nand what sorts of hypnosis protocols\nmight be optimal for you.\nSo if you are looking for a\nscience-backed, zero-cost,\nvery effective tool for\ngetting better at focusing,\nbetter at sleeping,\nbetter at all the things\nthat I believe people want,\nI do believe that is the best tool\nthat one can access at this point in time.\nSo then after I exit hypnosis,\nI usually give Costello a\nlittle scratch behind the ear,\nand then I make sure that I hydrate.\nHydration, again, is vitally\nimportant for brain function.\nIt's vitally important\nfor all bodily functions.\nAnd I often forget to do it,\nso I've just sort of linked\nthe drinking of water\nto my hypnosis practice.\nAs soon as I'm done, I hydrate.\nAnd then I tend to focus\non another work about.\nSo this would be, for\nme, sometime around 2:30\nor 3:00 in the afternoon\nwhen normally I would be\nquite sleepy and passing out.\nHowever, the protocol of\nshifting my morning caffeine\nto 90 minutes to two hours after waking,\nas well as the use of\nthis hypnosis protocol\nhas really allowed me to\nmove through the afternoon\nin a way that I don't\nexperience that dip in.\nEnergy every once in a while\nI'll feel kind of sleepy\nor kind of out of it,\nbut I've been really pleasantly surprised\nat the extent to which one\ncan avoid that afternoon dip.\nIf you do certain things properly prior\nto the arrival of 2:00 or 3:00 PM.\nNow, if you're a napper and\nyou want to nap, no big deal.\nNaps can be wonderfully beneficial.\nHere are the rules around napping\naccording to the sleep science.\nStanford has an excellent sleep clinic.\nI consulted with Jamie Zeitzer,\nmy colleague in the\nStanford Sleep Laboratory,\nas well as Matt Walker out at Berkeley\nwhose name I'm sure most\nof you are familiar with.\nHe wrote this wonderful\nbook, \"Why We Sleep.\"\nNaps should be 90 minutes or less,\nand 20-minute naps are fine,\nbut not longer than 90 minutes.\nAnd there are essentially\ntwo varieties of people:\npeople for whom napping interferes\nwith falling asleep later\nthat night and staying asleep\nand people for whom the\nnap does not interfere.\nYou have to decide who you are.\nAnd if you're somebody who can nap\nand not have any trouble falling asleep\nand staying asleep later that night,\nwell, by all means, nap.\nJust make it 90 minutes or less.\nAgain, these 90-minute cycles\nare really a vital constraint\nthat we should all obey.\nIf it's 91 minutes, don't worry.\nYou won't dissolve into a puddle of tears.\nBut if you're starting\nto sleep for an hour\nor more in the afternoon,\nthat can be problematic.\nIf you're somebody who can\nnap for 10, 20 minutes,\nthat's probably better than\ngetting a full 90-minute cycle,\nunless you didn't get enough\nsleep the night before.\nBut you really have to figure\nout what's right for you.\nThere's a lot of variety there.\nBut that's essentially\nwhat the science says.\nNow, whether or not you nap or whether\nor not you do not nap,\na key protocol for sleep\nhealth and wakefulness\nand metabolism and hormone\nhealth is viewing light\nin the afternoon.\nSo here's the reason for doing this.\nAs we progress into the evening hours,\nthere's a phenomenon where\nour retina, our eyes,\nbecome very sensitive to light,\nsuch that if we view bright lights\nor even not so bright lights\nbetween the hours of 10:00 PM and 4:00 AM,\nthat is strongly disruptive,\nvery disruptive for our\ndopamine production.\nIt can really screw up our sleep,\nand it's actually been shown in data\nfrom David Berson's lab\nat Brown University,\none of the foremost circadian\nbiology laboratories,\nas well as Samer Hattar's laboratory\nat the National Institute of Mental Health\nthat viewing bright light,\nor even not so bright light,\nbetween these hours of\n11:00 PM and 4:00 AM\nor even 10:00 PM and 4:00\nAM can disrupt learning\nand memory, can disrupt the immune system\nand can disrupt mood in\nvery long-lasting ways.\nThere are ways to offset that, however.\nWhat I call your \"Netflix inoculation.\"\nFor those of you that like\nto stay up late on the tablet\nor computer or watching Netflix,\ngetting a little bit of\nafternoon light in your eyes,\nsomewhat counter-intuitively,\ncan prevent this disruption\nof bright light later in the\nevening, at least somewhat.\nWhat do I mean by that?\nWell, if you view light as the\nsun is starting to go down,\nso if you step outside\naround 4:00 PM, 5:00 PM,\nagain, what time exactly\nwill depend on time of year\nand where you are located on our planet,\nbut as the sun starts to head down,\nyou don't necessarily\nhave to see the sunset,\nit'd be lovely if you could,\nsunsets are beautiful,\nbut if you can get outside and\nsee the sun as it arcs down,\nor if you can't see the sun directly,\nget some sunlight in your\neyes in the afternoon hours,\nso maybe 4:00 PMish, and\ndo that for 20, 30 minutes,\nmaybe reading outside or taking a walk,\nI walk the dog again, that's my protocol,\nin order to get that evening light,\nwhat it does is it lowers the sensitivity\nof your retina in the late evening hours,\nwhich allows you to buffer yourself\nagainst the negative effects\nof bright light later at night.\nNow, it won't allow you to blast your eyes\nwith bright light;\nyou still need to dim the\nlights in the evening.\nBut there's a very nice\nstudy that was published\nin scientific reports that illustrates\nthat if one does this,\nif you go outside and view\nsunlight in the evening hours\nfor anywhere from five to 30 minutes,\nand I realized that people have a range\nof constraints on their schedule,\nbut from five to 30\nminutes, what happens is\nthat your melatonin\nrhythm stays appropriate.\nNow, we haven't talked\ntoo much about melatonin,\nbut melatonin is a hormone\nthat is inhibited by light.\nIt's actually prevented by light.\nAnd melatonin is the hormone\nthat allows you to fall asleep easily.\nNow, I'm not talking about\nsupplementing melatonin;\nI'm talking about melatonin\nthat you naturally\nproduce from your pineal.\nSo the protocol is very simple:\nget outside in the afternoon or evening\nfor 10 to 30 minutes,\ntake your sunglasses off,\nget some bright light, get some\nnatural light in your eyes.\nIf you can't do that,\nprobably better to just stay\nwith standard artificial lights inside.\nDon't crank them up, but\njust start to dim them.\nAgain, this would be a time\nto avoid blue blockers.\nPeople are popping on blue\nblockers at four o'clock\nin the afternoon 'cause you're worried\nthat blue light is going\nto disrupt your sleep.\nWell, you're making\nyour eyes more sensitive\nto any light that you might\nsee later in the evening,\nblue light or otherwise.\nSo get that afternoon light.\nSo what you'll probably notice\nis that the optimal protocols\nfor optimizing your brain and body health\nand performance and sleep, et cetera,\nare actually really simple.\nBut just because they're\nsimple does not mean\nthat they are not powerful;\nin fact, they are very powerful\nbecause they leverage the\nmost powerful technology\nthat exists, which is your nervous system.\nYou know, we always think\nabout technologies as devices,\nand indeed there are some\nwonderful devices out there.\nSome people are really\ninto tracking their sleep\nand their sleep time.\nIf you're into that, great.\nThat's not something that I personally do,\nalthough I keep telling\nmyself that I should do that.\nThere are devices that\ncan control brainwaves\nand things of that sort.\nBut what we are talking about\ntoday are really basic things\nthat we can all do that\ncan steer our neurology\nand our biology in the directions\nthat are going to support workflow,\nthat are going to support hormones,\nthat are going to support brain function.\nSo this afternoon light\nviewing is yet another example\nof leveraging a technology\nthat you were born with\nand that you will die with\nand that you will have\nevery day in between\nin order to tweak the\nhormones of your system,\nin this case, the hormone melatonin,\nso that it's released\nat the appropriate times\nand not at the wrong times.\nBecause we know that when hormones\nand systems of the body are well aligned\nwith the 24-hour schedule,\nbeautiful things happen.\nAnd when they are misaligned,\nterrible things happen.\nSometimes those terrible\nthings are subtle at first,\nbut disrupting your circadian\nrhythms is really bad\nfor every system in your body.\nGetting it right, and as you can tell,\ngetting it right doesn't take much,\ncan really serve to \"optimize\" you.\nWhen I say \"optimize,\"\nI mean it puts you into\na better mood overall,\nbetter state for learning, et cetera.\nSo get that afternoon light as well.\nSo at some point in the evening,\nI eat that thing that we call dinner.\nAnd while it feels sort of\nstrange to talk about my dinner,\nthe reason I want to talk about my dinner\nand what I eat for dinner is that for me,\ndinner, of course, is about eating-\nI'll mention again I love eating-\nbut also about optimizing the transition\nto sleep and sleep.\nSo obviously I eat foods that I enjoy.\nI'm not one of these people\nthat will eat anything\nor avoid eating anything\nsimply to benefit from that.\nI do enjoy food very, very much.\nAnd so my dinner generally\nis comprised of things\nthat are going to support\nrest and deep sleep.\nAnd that means starchy carbohydrates.\nIt's absolutely clear\nthat one of the major ways\nthat we can increase serotonin,\nwhich helps in the transition to sleep,\nis by ingesting starchy carbohydrates.\nNow, I realized that starchy\ncarbohydrates are kind\nof a demonized term nowadays\nand everyone's anti-carbs,\nbut, you know, we really\nshould distinguish\nbetween refined sugars\nand complex carbohydrates.\nAnd we did an episode about this.\nWe talked about how\nrefined sugars disrupt,\nnot just metabolism,\nbut they actually disrupt\nsome of the neurons in the gut\nthat sense fatty acids and amino acids\nfrom fats and proteins.\nBut those same neurons can\nactually respond to sugar\nand create a situation\nwhere you actually\nstart craving more sugar\nbecause those neurons\nin your gut communicate\nvia a nerve pathway for\nyou aficionados called\n\"the vagus nerve\" and a little cluster\nof neurons called the \"nodose ganglia.\"\nN-O-D-O-S-E.\nNodose ganglias are right\nnext to the corner of your jaw\nand can trigger the activation\nand the release of dopamine in your brain,\nwhich basically makes\nyou crave more sugar,\nindependent of how something tastes.\nSo when I say carbohydrates,\nwhat I really mean is\nstarchy carbohydrates,\nnon-refined sugars.\nAnd in the episode about food and mood\nand metabolism as well,\nI referenced a really spectacular lecture\nby Dr. Robert Lustig who's\na pediatric endocrinologist\nat UCSF, UC San Francisco,\nabsolutely spectacular talk,\nyou can find it on YouTube easily,\nwhere he talks about the\nscience of refined sugars.\nAnd this isn't in any kind of\nconspiracy or paranoid way.\nThis is really the medical\nand scientific literature.\nSo my dinner is carbohydrates\nand some protein.\nSo maybe some chicken or\nfish or something like that,\nmaybe some eggs, or sometimes just pasta\nor just rice and vegetables.\nAnd that's because I enjoy those foods,\nbut also because I want to\nincrease the amount of serotonin\nin my brain so that I can\nactually fall asleep that night.\nMany people who are on\nlow-carbohydrate diets struggle\nwith falling and staying asleep,\nand that's because it's hard\nto achieve heightened levels\nof serotonin which are\nnecessary to enter sleep.\nI should also mention that melatonin\nand serotonin fall in the same pathway.\nThey are related hormones\nand neuromodulators.\nWe won't go into their biosynthesis now,\nbut essentially what we're\ntalking about is a system\nthat's biasing us towards\nrest and relaxation\nas opposed to wakefulness.\nYou might ask, \"Well, can't\nI just take serotonin?\nCan't I just take 5-HTP\nor a precursor to\nserotonin or tryptophan?\"\nAnd indeed you can, however,\nmany people including myself,\nfind that when they\nsupplement with serotonin\nin the evening or at night,\nthat can cause problems\nin the architecture\nor the structure of sleep.\nIt can cause a lot of\npeople, including me,\nto fall asleep very fast,\nsleep very deeply for three or four hours,\nand then wake up\nand have a terrible time\nfalling back asleep.\nAnd that effect, at least for\nme, can last several days.\nIt's really disruptive.\nSo I don't like to\nsupplement with anything\nthat is directly dopamine\nor a precursor to dopamine\nat any time or directly serotonin\nor a precursor to serotonin.\nRather, there are other things\nthat can enhance the\ntransition to sleep safely,\nwhich we will talk about in a few minutes.\nBut the evening meal consists\nlargely of carbohydrates\nfor that specific purpose of\ngenerating a sense of calm.\nAnd, of course,\ncarbohydrates are delicious.\nAnd because I'm doing\nsome physical training\nand presumably you are as\nwell, or I hope you are,\n'cause it's so beneficial to one's health,\nthat's also going to\nreplenish my glycogen stores,\nwhich is one of the primary fuel sources\nfor moving one's muscles\nand moving around and doing exercise,\nas well as for the brain\nand for cognitive function.\nSo low carbohydrates\nthroughout the 24-hour period\nare not something that\nare attractive to me.\nI realized that some\npeople will do much better\non a low-carbohydrate\nor even ketogenic diet,\nbut for me, and I do\nbelieve for most people,\ncreating a situation of maybe fasting,\nand then low-carb or no-carb diets\nfor states of alertness and focus\nat one portion of the day,\nand then ingesting starchy carbohydrates\nfor sake of inducing\nrest and relaxation is a\nat least scientifically,\nrationally-based protocol.\nIt's grounded in real neurochemistry.\nIt's grounded in things that\nwe can point to and say,\n\"Ah, this food substance, this\nthing can support my brain,\nnot directly because\nit's some magic substance\nthat's going to make all\nmy neurons, you know,\nextremely robust, but rather\nit's going to support sleep,\"\nwhich is perhaps the\nfoundation of all mental\nand physical health.\nIn fact, we can point to\nsleep as the primary way\nin which we can ensure our overall health,\nincluding our brain health.\nSo let's talk about sleep\nand how to access sleep,\nhow to fall asleep easily,\nand how to make sure\nthat the sleep we have is\nof sufficient duration and quality.\nOne way to do that is to\nleverage the drop in temperature\nthat's necessary to fall and stay asleep.\nSo I mentioned earlier in the early parts\nof the day after waking,\nour body temperature is rising,\nand that continues throughout the day.\nAnd then sometime late in the afternoon,\nour temperature peaks,\nand then it starts to drop.\nThat drop in temperature\nof one to three degrees\nis vitally important for us to be able\nto fall asleep easily.\nOne way that we can\ndecrease our transition time\ninto sleep is to accelerate\nthat drop in temperature.\nAnd one way to accelerate that drop\nin temperature somewhat\ncounter-intuitively is\nto use hot baths, hot showers,\nor if you have access to one, a sauna.\nNow, this is counterintuitive\nbecause you'd say,\n\"Well, hot bath, so it's\ngoing to heat me up.\"\nBut actually, if you\nare to get into a sauna\nor a hot shower or hot\nbath, and then get out,\nyour body is going to\nengage particular mechanisms\nfor cooling itself off that are going\nto allow you to drop your\ntemperature more quickly\nand fall asleep more easily.\nAnd this is why many people find\nthat falling asleep after\na nice hot shower, bath,\nor sauna is really, really\neasy and really terrific.\nIt's sort of a natural state\nthat follows hot baths,\nsaunas, and showers.\nSo how would you do this?\nWell, we did an entire\nepisode on this topic as well.\nThe use of sauna for sake\nof growth hormone release.\nIf you want to check that\nout in all the details,\nyou can look at the\nepisode on growth hormone.\nYou will experience a growth\nhormone release from sauna,\nhot bath, and hot shower,\nprovided they're done\nfor sufficient duration\nand sufficiently high temperature.\nFor all the details of that,\nplease go to that episode.\nIt's all laid out there,\nit's all timestamped,\nit's all captioned in English\nand Spanish, et cetera.\nBut basically what we're talking\nabout is 20 minutes in the sauna,\nor if you're one of those folks\nwho's really chasing\ngrowth hormone release,\nyou could do 20 minutes,\nthen get out of the sauna for 10 minutes,\nand just cool off at room temperature,\nand then get back into\nthe sauna, then get out,\nand then shower, dry off, and head to bed.\nShorter bouts of sauna will work also.\nThe longer bouts of sauna, cooling, sauna,\ncooling have been shown\nto lead to huge increases\nin growth hormone.\nAnd growth hormone, of course,\nis involved both in muscle growth,\nbut also growth and\nmetabolism of all tissues,\nfat metabolism, and\nrepair of various tissues.\nSo it's not just about growth.\nYou hear growth hormone,\nyou think hypertrophy,\nbut the enhancement of\nmetabolism and health\nand repair in a number of tissues.\nSo that's one way you can leverage heat\ntoward the transition to sleep by the ways\nin which exposure to heat\nactually cools off your body.\nNow let's talk about\nactually getting to sleep.\nAnd let's talk about\nbehavioral protocols first.\nIt is absolutely true that keeping\nthe room very dark is beneficial.\nSome people, including myself,\nhave thin eyelids and it\ndoesn't take much light\nto wake up the brain and body.\nSo keeping a room very dark is essential.\nThe other thing is keeping the room cool.\nYou've probably heard this before.\nKeep the room cool, get\nunder warm blankets,\nbut rarely is it discussed why keeping\nthe room cool is useful.\nThe reason keeping the room cool is useful\nfor getting into and\nstaying asleep is that\nthroughout the night,\nthere are phases of sleep\nwhere you are paralyzed,\nso-called REM sleep,\nthat's a healthy paralysis,\npresumably so you can't\nact out your dreams,\nbut there are portions of\nthe night where you can move.\nAnd one of the more important movements\nthat you do in the middle of\nthe night is put your hand\nout or your foot out or\nyou take your face out\nfrom under the covers as\na means to cool yourself,\nand you do this while you are asleep.\nIf you are in a cool room,\nyou can put yourself under\nthe blankets to stay warm,\nand then if you want to cool off,\nyou can simply remove a limb\nor you can toss the covers off entirely.\nHowever, if you are in\na room that's too warm,\nit's very hard to cool off.\nYou would need a bucket of ice water\nor to get up and turn\non the air conditioning\nor something of that\nsort or turn on the fan.\nSo it's a simple but non-trivial way\nin which we can improve our entrance\nto sleep and staying asleep.\nSo keep the room cool or cold\nand get under warm blankets.\nAnd if you want to understand more\nabout why putting a hand out\nor a foot out is valuable for cooling,\nI did an episode on the role of cooling\nin something called \"heat dumping\"\nor bringing he into the body\nthrough the palms, the face,\nand the bottoms of the feet.\nYou've got these portals,\nthese radiators, if you will,\nthat allow us to bring heat\ninto the body and to dump heat.\nI don't want to go into the details now,\nbut that episode is entitled\n\"Supercharge Your Exercise With Cold,\"\nis based on work that was done\nby Craig Heller's lab\nat Stanford University.\nAbsolutely incredible data showing\nthat the proper use of palmar cooling,\nso the palms or the upper half of the face\nor the bottoms of the feet,\ncan vastly, I mean vastly\nincrease the volume\nof exercise that one can do\nand still recover from that exercise\nand derive benefits from it.\nBut this method of cooling\nfor exercise is grounded\nin a basic physiological\nfunction of our palms,\nthe bottoms of our feet, and our face,\nwhich is to dump heat\nor to allow cool to pass into the body.\nSo that's why in the middle of the night,\nas long as you're not in REM\nsleep, if you get too warm,\nyou put your foot out or\nyou put your arms out.\nYou're actually allowing\ncooling of the body\nthrough what are called \"AVAs,\"\narteriovenous anastomosis\nis the technical name,\nthat are in the palms, the\nupper half of the face,\nand the bottoms of the feet.\nAnd that's a very efficient\nway to cool off your body,\nso you do that subconsciously.\nNow, there are things that one can take\nto enhance the transition to sleep.\nI am not a fan of melatonin\nfor enhancing the transition\nto sleep for a couple of reasons.\nOne, dosages of melatonin are far too high\nin most supplements.\nMelatonin can have some negative effects\non the sex steroid hormones\ntestosterone and estrogen.\nThat's a serious concern.\nThird, melatonin's role during puberty\nor around puberty is to\nsuppress the onset of puberty.\nSo that's concerning.\nI don't know that people\nshould be taking this hormone\nthat has all these other effects.\nThe other reason is that\nmelatonin will aid the transition\nto sleep, but it won't keep you asleep.\nAnd many people that take melatonin find\nthat they fall asleep more quickly,\nbut then they wake up\nunable to fall back asleep.\nThree compounds that\ncan be very beneficial\nfor aiding the transition to sleep\nand for which there are\nwide safety margins,\nalthough please do check\nwith your physician\nbefore taking anything, are\nspecific forms of magnesium,\nsomething called\n\"apigenin\" and \"theanine.\"\nMagnesium comes in many forms.\nMagnesium malate has been shown\nto improve recovery from\nsore muscles, for instance.\nMagnesium citrate is an\nexcellent laxative, for instance,\nMagnesium threonate,\nthat's T-H-R-E-O-N-A-T-E,\nthreonate, and magnesium\nbisglycinate have transporters\nthat allow them to cross\nthe blood-brain barrier more readily\nthan other forms of magnesium.\nAnd there within the brain,\nthey promote the release of a\nneurotransmitter called GABA,\nwhich is an inhibitory neurotransmitter\nwhich shuts off the\nforebrain to some extent.\nIt doesn't shut it off completely,\nbut it essentially shuts\ndown thinking, rumination,\nplanning, and in what we\ncall \"executive function.\"\nSo for many people,\ntaking 300 to 400 milligrams\nof magnesium bisglycinate\nor magnesium threonate,\nand there I'm referring\nto the elemental magnesium\nfor you aficionados,\nmany people find that\ndoing that 30 to 60 minutes\nbefore sleep can aid\nthem in falling asleep,\ncan really help them fall\nasleep faster and stay asleep.\nSome people, however,\nachieve some gastrointestinal discomfort\nfrom magnesium and\ntherefore should avoid it.\nMagnesium threonate and\nmagnesium bisglycinate\nfor many people work, however,\nand when coupled with\napigenin and theanine,\nprovide a sort of synergy\nor a sleep cocktail\nthat seems to be very effective\nin aiding the transition to sleep.\nSo apigenin is the substance\nthat's found in chamomile.\nAnd 50 milligrams of\napigenin taken 30 minutes\nbefore sleep can act as another way\nto shut off the forebrain\nand reduce rumination,\nreduce anxiety, and allow\npeople to fall and stay asleep.\nI did a podcast with Dr. Darya Rose.\nShe's got an excellent podcast\nthat I highly recommend you check out.\nCovers a number of different\nhealth, scientific,\nand other subjects.\nAnd she's a PhD in neuroscience,\nterrific scientist, et cetera.\nShe's a big fan of apigenin, as am I.\nAnd then the third compound\nis theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E.\nTheanine is a compound that\ncan also increase GABA,\nbut also increases activation\nof something called \"chloride channels.\"\nChloride channels are another way\nin which neurons turn themselves\noff or turn each other off.\nNot turn each other off in the way\nthat we typically hear\nlike that turns me off,\nbut turn them off and then shut them down.\nLower their levels of activity.\nSo magnesium threonate or bisglycinate,\napigenin, and theanine in\ncombination can be very effective\nfor aiding the transition to sleep.\nAnd I realized that not everyone\nwants to take supplements.\nI certainly am not pushing any of these.\nI would hope that everybody\nbe able to fall asleep easily\nand stay asleep for the duration of time\nthat they want without\nany supplemental help,\nbut I do think it's important\nto point out some things\nthat lie somewhere between doing nothing\nand taking prescription drugs,\nbecause many of the\nprescription drugs associated\nwith sleep, and you all\nknow what those are,\ncarry other side effects.\nThey can create bad dreams,\noften very disturbing dreams.\nThey can be addictive or\nat least habit forming.\nThey can create grogginess in the morning.\nSome are safer than others.\nThere's a variety of them out there.\nBut for those that want\nto explore supplements\nand how they can impact sleep,\nthis combination of about 300,\n400 milligrams of magnesium\nthreonate or bisglycinate,\n50 milligrams of apigenin,\nand 100 to 200 milligrams\nof theanine alone\nor in combination have been\nbeneficial to many people.\nAnd there are excellent studies\nto support those statements.\nAgain, I suggest you go to examine.com\nand look up the Human Effect Matrix\nfor each of those compounds,\nand you can explore them.\nOne of the more interesting\naspects to magnesium threonate\nand bisglycinate is that it seems\nto have some neuroprotective\neffects as well.\nThere aren't many studies on it,\nbut the few studies that are there point\nto the fact that magnesium threonate\nand magnesium bisglycinate can\nalso support neuron health\nand neuron longevity,\nwhich is just an added\nbonus, in my opinion.\nNow, what if you wake up\nin the middle of the night?\nThis is a very common occurrence.\nAnd there are two general\nthemes around waking up\nin the middle of the night\nthat one can use tools to counteract.\nThe first theme is if you're somebody\nwho is tired in the evenings\nand you're kind of pushing\nyourself to stay awake,\nso you're going to the party\nor you're pushing yourself\nto study or work when in fact you'd like\nto get into bed at 8:30 or 9:00,\nand then you're falling\nasleep around 10:30, 11:00,\nand waking up at 2:30\nor 3:00 in the morning\nand you can't fall back asleep,\nchances are that your melatonin pulse\nwas initiated early in the night.\nSo that melatonin pulse started probably\naround 8:30 or 9:00,\nbut you're staying up,\nyou're battling that melatonin.\nAnd then sometime around\n2:30 or 3:00 in the morning,\nthat melatonin is no longer present\nat sufficiently high\nlevels in your bloodstream\nand you're waking up,\nyou're getting your morning\ncortisol pulse shifted\ninto those wee hours of the morning.\nYou may not like this advice,\nbut one of the things\nthat you can do to offset\nthat is to simply go to bed earlier.\nBy going to bed earlier,\nyou're going to get the\nlonger duration of sleep.\nBut I realized that\nthere are social reasons\nand work-related reasons why going\nto bed at 8:30 or 9:00 is\nnot necessarily beneficial\nto your life.\nSo in that case,\nyou might be one of the rare individuals\nfor whom getting a little\nbit more bright light\nin the evening could be a good thing.\nSo this would be around the\nhours of 7:00 or 8:00 PM.\nAnd in that way, causing\nthat pulse in melatonin\nto be delayed because, again,\nlight inhibits melatonin.\nNow, the other thing\nis many people wake up\nin the middle of the\nnight because of anxiety\nor because they have to use the restroom.\nIt's perfectly fine to flip on the lights,\nbut keep the lights dim.\nBut if you flip on those lights,\ntry and flip them off as soon as possible\nand try and get back into bed.\nAnd if you have trouble\nfalling asleep again\nand you absolutely need to sleep,\nthat's where these NSDR,\nthese non-sleep deep rest protocols,\ncan really be beneficial,\neven though the NS, the non-sleep part,\nmight make you think that\nthey will prevent you\nfrom falling asleep.\nRather than trying to fight your mind,\ntrying to fight anxiety,\nwhich is always a terrible thing to do,\nI always say it's very hard\nto control the mind with\nthe mind, look to the body.\nAnd that's what NSDR scripts do.\nThings like yoga nidra,\neven the sleep hypnosis done\nin the middle of the night\nif you wake up and want\nto fall back asleep\noftentimes will help you\nfall back asleep immediately.\nAnd if they don't,\nthey will at least put your brain and body\ninto a state of deep relaxation\nthat more closely mimics the sleep state\nthat you ought to be in\nthan the awake, ruminating,\nstressing about the fact that\nyou're not sleeping state.\nSo if you wake up in\nthe middle of the night,\nreally try and get back to sleep.\nAnd if you can't do that\nby doing, for instance,\nlong exhale breathing, which can work,\nuse some other tool of the\nbody to shift the mind.\nAnd the tools that I'm recommending are\nof the non-sleep deep rest variety.\nSo now we've essentially\ntraveled around the clock,\nso to speak, from the\ntime where one wakes up\nuntil the time they start working,\nuntil the time they exercise, eat lunch,\ndo an NSDR, head to sleep,\nget to sleep, maybe wake up,\nget back to sleep, et cetera.\nI want to emphasize that,\nalthough people's schedules vary,\nmost people are doing more than one\nor two work bouts per day.\nAnd indeed, I'm doing more than one\nor two work bouts per day.\nI really emphasize that\nmorning, 90-minute work block\nbecause I think most people would agree\nthat there's a portion of each day\nin which we need to do the hardest thing\nor the most important thing\nor the thing that demands the\nmost of our cognitive self.\nI position that early in the day\nand I position everything around that\nin order to ensure that it happens\nand that it happens with the\nhighest degree of efficiency,\nand yes, I make sure that\nit happens every day.\nAnd that brings about two\nother important points.\nFirst of all, we do have\nthis thing called weekends,\nand I tend to take one day\noff per week, not both,\nmuch to the dismay of people\nin my life and Costello.\nBut nonetheless, there is\nsomething called weekend drift,\nwhich is that we can be very regimented\non a Monday or a Tuesday,\nand then even if we're good\nabout maintaining a schedule\nWednesday, Thursday, Friday,\net cetera, most of us, I would hope,\nwould alter their schedule\nsomewhat on the weekends\nin order to recover and\nget some additional rest.\nAnd I want to emphasize\nI absolutely do that.\nI take one day per week\nwhere I go full Costello,\nwhere I essentially do\nnothing in a structured way.\nAt least if I have my way,\nI'm not making any plans,\nI'm completely free to\nexplore what I want to do\nand when I want to do it.\nThat's not the way life works out.\nOftentimes there are social engagements\nand other things that get in the way\nor that I enjoy and\nthat breaks up the day,\nbut I do take rest.\nI don't think that one has\nto follow the same\nschedule every single day;\nhowever, I do think there are a few things\nthat people should do every\nsingle day, if possible,\nand those are get morning sunlight,\nbecause if you don't\nyour circadian rhythms\nand your health, et cetera,\nand your mood are going to start to drift,\nand to try and get sleep\non a regular basis.\nAnd, of course, some of\nthe greatest of things\nin life happen after 10:00 PM\nand some of those even\ninvolve sleepless nights\nof various kinds.\nI certainly don't want\nto discourage people\nfrom having a social life\nor from having a robust party life,\nif that's your thing, or for enjoying life\nbecause that's certainly\none of the main things\nthat we should all be\npursuing, is to enjoy life.\nThe only point I want\nto make about sleep is\nthat if you happen to stay up late,\nit's still best to get up at\nyour regular wake-up time.\nIt's a very simple solution to a problem\nthat a lot of people have,\nwhich is they stay up till\n2:00 or 3:00 in the morning,\nand then they tend to sleep late,\nand then it tends to disrupt their rhythm.\nTry on most days and most nights\nto wake up at more or less the same time\nand try to go to sleep at\nmore or less the same time.\nIn fact, I was talking to Matt\nWalker about this recently,\nand he was also surprised\nto see these new data\nand I was surprised to see these new data\nthat emphasize that if you\nget a poor night's sleep\nor if you're up late the\nprevious night for good reasons,\nmany people feel like they just\nwant to go to bed early the next night,\nbut it turns out that's\nnot the best thing to do\nfor your immediate and long-term health.\nTry and stay up to the point\nwhere you would normally stay up,\nand then get to sleep.\nIf you go to bed a couple hours earlier,\nit's probably not going to kill you,\nbut try to not go to bed,\nfor instance, at 6:00 PM,\nbecause you were up the\nentire night before.\nThat can really be disruptive.\nThe other thing I want to emphasize is\nthat even though that morning,\n90-minute work block is\nso vital, of course,\nthere's a second work block.\nAnd in fact, I described one\nin the afternoon after the NSDR.\nFor me, that's Reveri hypnosis.\nThere's a 90-minute work block\nin which I drop in again in\na no internet connection,\nno phone kind of way to complete some work\nthat's important to me.\nSo combined, that's just\nthree hours of focused work,\nwhich may not seem like a lot,\nbut if you were to dissect your day\nand kind of look at the arc\nand structure of your day,\nI'd be willing to bet that\nif we added up the total period of time\nin which you were in what Cal\nNewport would call deep work,\nreally focused, dedicated work,\nthat it would probably amount\nto about three or four hours.\nIf you can squeeze in\nanother 90-minute work block\nor if you can get four\n90-minute work blocks,\nwell, then more power to you,\nbut I think most people find that one\nor two of these really deep\nfocus, 90-minute work blocks are\nabout what one's schedule\nand even mind can handle.\nAnd, of course, throughout the day,\nthere are other things happening.\nOutside of those 90-minute work blocks,\nI'm checking my text messages,\nI'm checking my email,\nI'm responding to various demands.\nI'm working and tending to life.\nSo while I've carved some boundaries\nor delineated some boundaries\naround those work blocks,\nand I'm certain that if you do too,\nyou will benefit from them,\nthey are certainly not the\nonly periods of time each day\nin which I or I believe\nother people should be trying\nto learn or trying to focus.\nAnd I want to emphasize\nthat even though my job is\nto discover knowledge\nand distribute knowledge\nbecause I'm a scientist,\nI realized that 90-minute\nwork blocks of the sort\nthat I'm describing may\nnot apply specifically\nto the kinds of work you do.\nIf you're an artist or a sculptor\nor you build furniture,\nwhatever it is that you happen to,\nyou teach children or they teach you,\nwhatever it happens to be,\nof course, please adapt and\nmodify what I've described today\nin ways that best serve\nyou and your schedule.\nWhat I've tried to do\nis provide you a picture\nof the 24- hour schedule that I follow\nand why I do certain\nthings at particular times\nand why I do those particular things.\nAnd I've really tried to\nemphasize the scientific rationale\nbehind those things,\nthe peer-reviewed data.\nIn some cases, I pointed\nout the specific papers.\nIn other cases, I've referred\nto large bodies of work\nthat support these practices.\nWhen I say \"large bodies of work,\"\nI'm a big fan of looking to\nthe scientific literature\nand asking, \"Where is the center of mass\nfor a particular topic?\"\nFor instance, where is there\n50 or 100 or 1,000 papers\nthat, for instance, support\nmorning light viewing\nin order to optimize melatonin\nsecretion in the day,\ncortisol secretion early in the day,\nmood, metabolism, et cetera?\nIf one were to put into\nPubMed \"light, metabolism,\nand mood,\" you would literally\nget tens of thousands,\nmaybe even hundreds of\nthousands of studies.\nSo when I say the center of mass,\nwhat I've really tried to\ndo is examine the literature\nand figure out where there's\nsort of a directive protocol\nthat emerges from all\nthese various studies\nthat used, you know,\nin some cases, animals,\nin many cases, humans\nand explored different,\nwhat we call, \"dependent variables.\"\nSome studies were looking\nat effects on blood sugar,\nother on mood.\nSo I hope that makes\nclear why the rationale\nbehind what I provided today.\nIf you're learning from this\npodcast and enjoying it,\nplease support us by subscribing\nto the YouTube channel.\nThere at YouTube you can also\nprovide comments and feedback.\nWe use that
