    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing how to\nbuild a strong pain-free back having a\nstrong pain-free back has numerous\nadvantages not the least of which is\nyou're not in pain as well as the fact\nthat you can carry out your daily\nactivities any exercise or Sports you\nmight play interaction with family\nmembers like picking up a kid leaning\ndown to get things out of a cupboard or\nreaching up to get things out of a\ncabinet without any pain and back pain\nis one of those things that even if\nminor and certainly if severe severely\nimpedes our ability to do most\neverything even to just sit still or lay\nstill and one of the things about pain\nin particular back and neck pain is that\nit also has an effect on our emotional\nself it makes us more irritable it makes\nany activity even the mundane activities\nthat much more distressing to carry out\nso during today's discussion we will\ntalk about how to amarate pain however\npain as a general topic was already\ncovered on this podcast with an expert\nguest Dr Shawn Mackey who's a medical\ndoctor at Stanford he's actually the\ndirector of our pain clinic and on that\nepisode which we provide a link to in\nthe show note captions he talks about\nthe various ways to address pain\neverything from pain medication to\nepidurals to electrical stimulation\nand importantly the biopsychosocial\nmodel of pain whereby our thoughts and\nour perceptions about pain actually\ninfluence the severity and the duration\nof that pain so if you're interested in\npain and the treatment of pain per se I\nhighly recommend that episode today we\nwill certainly talk about ways to deal\nwith back pain ways to reduce it and\nperhaps even eliminate it alt together\nbut we are also going to talk a lot\nabout how to pain proof your back and\nhow to build a really strong back not\njust for pulling things because the back\nmuscles are involved in pulling things\nbut also just for generating a really\nstrong stable core strong spinal\nErectors making sure that your pelvis\nand your spine are interacting correctly\nthat your shoulders neck and Spine and\npelvis and even your lower Limbs and\nfeet are working together in the proper\nmanner to make sure that you have the\nstrongest and most pain-free back\npossible so what I'm going to do is\nfirst I'm going to describe a bit of\nback anatomy and physiology I'm going to\ntalk about the neuromuscular components\nas well as the spinal and disc\ncomponents I promise even if you don't\nhave a background in biology I'm going\nto make this all very accessible to any\nand all of you and then I'm going to go\ninto the 10 or 12 specific things in\nparticular six things that take very\nlittle time that require no equipment no\npurchase of anything whatsoever and\ninvolve a very minimal time investment\nthat will allow you to build a really\nstrong pain-free back what's covered are\nprotocols from three of the world's for\nforemost experts in back pain but also\nback strengthening and building\nresilience into the back so they include\na medical doctor expert in back\nstrengthening and Rehabilitation a PhD\nresearcher who has spent decades\nresearching The Spine and ways to\nstrengthen the core and Spine and a\nworld-class PhD physical therapist who\nis expert not just in the spine but in\nfact in the movement Rehabilitation and\nstrengthening of the entire body they\nare the MD Dr Shawn Miller\nthe PHD Dr Stuart Mcgill and also the\nPHD Dr Kelly starett I provide links to\nthem and resources that they provide in\nthe show note captions and indeed I plan\nto host all three of them separately on\nthe huberman Lab podcast as expert\nguests in the not too distant future\nbefore we begin I'd like to emphasize\nthat this podcast is separate from my\nteaching and research roles at Stanford\nit is however part of my desire and\neffort to bring zero cost to Consumer\ninformation about science and science\nrelated tools to the General Public in\nkeeping with that theme I'd like to\nthank the sponsors of today's podcast\nour first sponsor is arero press arero\npress is like a French press but a\nFrench press that always bruis the\nperfect cup of coffee meaning no\nbitterness and excellent taste Aero\npress achieves this because it uses a\nvery short contact time between the hot\nwater and the coffee and that short\ncontact time also means that you can\nbrew an excellent cup of coffee very\nquickly the whole thing takes only about\n3 minutes I started using an aero press\nover 10 years ago and I learned about it\nfrom a guy named Alan Adler who's a\nformer Stanford engineer engineer who's\nalso an inventor he developed things\nlike the aobi Frisbee in any event I'm a\nbig fan of Adler inventions and when I\nheard he developed a coffee maker beero\npress I tried it and I found that indeed\nit makes the best possible tasting cup\nof coffee it's also extremely small and\nportable so I started using it in the\nlaboratory when I travel on the road and\nalso at home and I'm not alone in my\nlove of the Aeropress coffee maker with\nover 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress is\nthe best reviewed coffee press in the\nworld if you'd like to try Aero press\nyou can go to Aero press.com huberman to\nget 20% off Aeropress currently ships in\nthe USA Canada and to over 60 other\ncountries around the world again that's\nAero press.com huberman today's episode\nis also brought To Us by ju ju makes\nmedical grade red light therapy devices\nnow if there's one thing I've\nconsistently emphasized on this podcast\nis the incredible role that light can\nhave on our biology and of course I'm\nalways telling people that they should\nget sunlight in their eyes as soon as\npossible after waking on as many many\ndays of their life as possible for sake\nof setting circadian rhythm daytime mood\nfocus and alertness and improv sleep now\nin addition to sunlight red light and\nnearin red light has been shown to have\npositive effects on improving numerous\naspects of Cellar and organ Health\nincluding faster Muscle Recovery\nimproved skin health and wound healing\neven improvements in acne or that is\nremoval of acne reducing pain and\ninflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving Vision\nitself what sets you apart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning it uses specific\nwavelengths of red light and near\ninfrared light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the ju handheld light\nboth at home and when I travel it's only\nabout the size of a sandwich it's very\nconvenient to use I also have a ju whole\nbody panel and I use that about three or\nfour times a week if you would like to\ntry ju you can go to\njv.com\nhuberman ju is offering an exclusive\ndiscount to all huberman lab listeners\nwith up to $400 off select ju products\nagain that's ju\njv.com huberman to get $400 off select\nju products today's episode is also\nbrought To Us by waking up waking up is\na meditation app that offers hundreds of\nguided meditations mindfulness trainings\nyoga needer sessions and more I started\nmeditating over three decades ago and\nwhat I found in the ensuing years is\nthat sometimes it was very easy for me\nto do my daily medic meditation practice\nI was just really diligent but then as\nthings would get more stressful which of\ncourse is exactly when I should have\nbeen meditating more my meditation\npractice would fall off with waking up\nthey make it very easy to find and\nconsistently use a given meditation\npractice it has very convenient\nreminders and they come in different\ndurations so even if you just have one\nminute or five minutes to meditate you\ncan still get your meditation in which\nresearch shows is still highly\nbeneficial in addition to the many\ndifferent meditations on the waking up\napp they also have Yoga Nidra sessions\nwhich are a form of non-sleep deep rest\nthat I personally find is extremely\nvaluable for restoring mental and\nphysical Vigor I tend to do a yoga Nedra\nlasting anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes\nat least once a day and if I ever wake\nup in the middle of the night and I need\nto fall back asleep I also find yoga NRA\nto be extremely useful if you'd like to\ntry the waking up app you can go to\nwaking up.com huberman to try a free\n30-day trial again that's waking up.com\nhuberman okay let's talk about the back\nthe back for many people simply means\nthe spine the Bony stuff that runs down\nyour middle now of course your spine\ndoesn't just run down your middle you've\ngot your cervical spine up near your\nneck don't ever forget that your neck is\nthe upper part of your spine you've got\nthe thoracic spine which is essentially\nthrough you know in insects we think of\nthe thorax remember that from biology\nclass in middle school or high school\nbut through your region here you know\nbasically down from the neck through the\nchest and then you've got your lumbar\nspine which is the part right below that\nand then you have the sacral spine which\nis the area of the spine that is in the\npelvic region and then of course there's\nthe bottom region of that which is\ncalled the coxic spine which is the very\nlowest part of the sacral region of the\nspine now of course that's the Bony\nstuff and if you've ever seen a spine on\na you know a skeleton of any kind or a\ndrawing of a skeleton you know that it's\na bunch of segments it's a bunch of bony\nsegments it's important to understand\nthat the back is made up not just of\nbony stuff but it's got stuff in between\nwhich are the discs the discs are the\nsoft tissue that sit between the\nvertebrae right the vertebrae of the\nbones and those discs have some\ndurability to them they're they're not\neasily squished but they can be squished\nthat is they can move they're a soft\ntissue that allows for mobility of the\nBony stuff so you've got basically bone\ndisc bone disc bone disc bone dis and\nit's those discs that allow for movement\nof the spine from side to side and it\nactually allows for some compression\nalong the length of the spine as well\nwhat sometimes today I'll refer to as\nvertical compression but actually\nvertical isn't the correct anatomical\nterm so in anatomical terms we talk\nabout anterior posterior we talk about\nrostral coddle which is just different\nlanguage for anterior posterior I'm\ngoing to try and avoid using fancy\nnomenclature as much as possible but the\npoint here is that those discs allow for\nmovement of the vertebrae but keep in\nmind that the vertebrae and the discs\nhave a whole down the middle they look\nlike donuts basically they're not\nperfectly round like donuts but for the\ntime being just think of them as Donuts\nright some are bony donuts and others\nhave more pliability to them but there's\na hole down their middle why well within\nthat hole is a long snake like piece of\nthe nervous system called the spinal\ncord which is the neural stuff the\nneurons now within the spinal cord it's\nnot just neurons nerve cells okay\nneurons means nerve cells it's also glea\nwhich are another cell type that\nprovides yes support to the neurons but\nalso do some really important things on\ntheir own like clearing out of metabolic\nwaste they actually regulate\ncommunication between neurons if you've\never heard that the Gia are just glue\nand that's actually the Latin\ntranslation of Gia glue it implies that\nthey're not doing much actively that\nthey're just sort of a passive\nparticipant keeping things together the\nglea are really doing important things\nas well but keep in mind that the spinal\ncord is this long snake like process of\nthe nervous system that extends down\nthrough the vertebrae and down through\nthe discs or if you prefer you can think\nabout the long snake like process of the\nspinal cord and then around it all along\nits length you have bony vertebrae disc\nbony vertebrae disc bony vertebrae disc\ngoing all the way from the neck region\ndown to that coxic region within the\npelvis now the thing about neural tissue\nis it's very soft it's very fragile and\none of the reasons we have vertebrae is\nto give the spinal cord some rigidity\nand protection from damage and that's\nreally important because the spinal cord\nthis long tube of neural tissue that\nsits inside of the vertebrae and the\ndiscs it's central nervous system tissue\nCNS tissue and as CNS tissue it does not\nregenerate after injury okay maybe a\ntiny bit in certain conditions and in\nvery young people but if the spinal cord\nis damaged typically there's a lot of\nscar tissue that forms but there is no\nrenewal of the neurons that are damaged\nso it's very important that the spinal\ncord be protected which is one of the\nreasons why it is encased by those\nvertebrae and the discs now the other\nthing to understand is that the spinal\ncord is indeed a snake-like extension\nout the back of the brain so the brain\nand spinal cord make up what we call the\ncentral nervous system the CNS we just\ntalked about that a moment ago but now I\nwant you to think about the brain your\nbrain of course is encapsulated within\nthe skull the cranial Vault there are\nonly two pieces of your brain that\nreside outside of the cranial Vault they\nare your neural retinas that line the\nback of your eyes I know many of you\nhave heard me say this before but it's\nso cool that I can't help but share it\nagain and again which is that you have\ntwo pieces of your brain literally your\ncentral nervous system that were\nextruded out from the cranial Vault\nduring development while you were in\nutero this happens in the first\ntrimester when you were in embryo that\nline the back of your eyes like a pie\ncrust and those Linings of the back of\nyour eye like a pie crust are made up of\nthree layers of neurons and a bunch of\nGAA and they are your neural retinas\nthey are two pieces of brain that\nliterally look out into the world and\nare activated by what by light by\nsunlight by edges and objects by the\nphotons in the outside world and that's\nwhat gives rise to Vision so starting at\nthe front of your head and working down\nthrough the spinal cord we can do this\nvery quickly to give you a complete\npicture you've got your neural retinas\nthat line the back of your eyes they are\ncentral nervous system they are brain\nthey communicate with the rest of your\nbrain through the optic nerves then you\ngot your brain you got the brain parts\nthat respond to hearing the brain parts\nthat allow you to think imagine learn\nremember Etc and then at the back of the\nbrain you have the brain stem and then\nextending out from the brain stem you\nhave the spinal cord this tube like\nneural structure that extends down\nthrough the vertebrae down through the\ndiscs all the way to your pelvic region\nnow why am I telling you all this\nNeuroscience if we're talking about\nstrengthening the back why am I talking\nabout the spinal cord why am talking\nabout neurons in the brain well just as\nyour brain has the cranial Vault your\nskull to protect it your spinal cord has\nthe vertebrae to protect it and the\ndiscs to protect it but the discs allow\nfor some movement of the spinal cord in\nfact quite a bit of movement if you just\nlean forward in your chair you lean back\narch your back or you twist to the side\nyour spinal cord is actually twisting in\nthat way okay this would be Ain to your\nbrain actually moving within the skull\nit can move a little bit but it doesn't\nmove nearly as much as your spinal cord\ndoes so your back has of course many\nfunctions it's there to stabilize your\nbody it's there to provide stiffness in\norder to be able to move your limbs in\nvery Dynamic ways we're going to talk\nabout back and core stiffness as such a\nkey feature of having a strong back when\nyou hear the word stiffness you probably\nthink well that can't be good I don't\nwant a stiff back ah but you actually\nwant to be able to generate rigidity\nwithin your core and spine in order to\nmove your limbs to throw a ball or to do\na martial arts Punch or to even dance\ngracefully or even just move up some\nstairs without falling so basically when\nwe talk about the brain and spinal cord\nas extending down through the vertebrae\nand through the discs we're doing that\nto set up the other piece of this whole\nstory which is that the neurons that\nreside in the spinal cord in particular\nwhat we call the ventral spinal cord\nwhich if we're going to imagine this in\nkind of more real world terms they're\nsitting in the part of the spinal cord\nit's kind of on your front Okay that\nthat's facing uh the front of the world\nthere are neurons there called motor\nneurons neur the motor neurons\nthemselves what we call the cell bodies\nreside in the spinal cord in the so-call\nventral Horn of the spinal cord you can\nlook this up if you like although you\ndon't need to know that and they extend\nlittle wires that we call axons out to\nthe muscles and through the release of\nneurotransmitters they allow our muscles\nto move our flexors to flex like our\nbicep our extensors to extend like our\ntricep could think quadricep hamstring\ncalf abdominal muscles all the movement\nof those muscles is controlled by\nneurons that reside within the spine\ncord some of the movements that we\ngenerate are unconscious movements\nespecially movements that are required\nfor breathing although you can\nconsciously take care of your breathing\nas well right you can breathe\nunconsciously you're always doing that\neven in sleep or you can take conscious\ncontrol of your breathing you can\ngenerate limb movements consciously or\nyou can generate limb movements\nunconsciously typically once you know\nhow to walk and you get up and you walk\nacross the room you're not thinking\nright foot Left Foot Right Foot left\nfoot all of that's handled by motor\nneurons and what are called Central\npattern generators in the spinal cord\nand to some extent the brain stem but\nthe commands for specific deliberate\nmovements that you're thinking about\nespecially when you're trying to learn a\nmovement or you're trying to be very\ndeliberate in a movement those come from\nwhat are called upper motor neurons in\nthe brain they communicate with lower\nmotor neurons which then communicate\nwith the muscles okay so that's one\nneural outflow pathway from spinal cord\nout to muscles some of it's conscious\nsome of it's unconscious and then there\nare the neural Pathways from skin from\nthe tendons and insert of the muscles\nonto bone within the muscles that\nregister how much stretch are on our\nmuscles and those are the soall sensory\ninputs that come into the dorsal part of\nthe spinal cord the part that is facing\ntoward our back and that sensory\ninformation tells our spinal cord which\nthen informs our brain whether or not\nour limbs are extended too far and about\nto snap or whether or not a muscle is\nloaded too heavy and is about to be\npulled off the bone and in that case the\nbrain and spinal cord have these\nmagnificent mechanisms to shut down the\nneurons so that you know we drop the\nload so that we don't overwhelm the\nmuscle and rip it off the bone or we\ndon't stretch our limbs too far now keep\nin mind that the neurons within the\nspinal cord that communicate with\nmuscles or the neurons that innervate as\nwe call it the skin or the tendons or\ndifferent parts of the body and go into\nthe spinal cord those little wires those\naxons literally leave the spinal cord\nand they go out into What's called the\nperipheral nervous system now a big\nsource of pain in back pain is when\nthose nerve Roots as they're called\nthey're little bundles okay bundles of\nnerves are sometimes called fices\nsometimes called nerve Roots the\nnomenclature kind of depends on where\nyou are in the nervous system but I'll\ncall them nerve roots or bundles of\nnerves those bundles of nerves are\nsometimes impinged on they're physically\npressed on by say a bulging what's also\ncalled a herniated disc the discs can\nsometimes bulge out from the side of the\nspine a little bit too much okay Maybe\nby compression from the overlying\nvertebrae maybe from some inflammation\nwe'll talk about the various sources\ntoday and often times the source of back\npain or neck pain or even pain in the\npelvic region is because of a\ncompression of the nerve roots that are\ngoing into and out of the spine okay so\nwhen we talk today about back pain and\nwhen we talk today about building a\nstrong back we need to focus on two\nmajor themes one is the extent to which\nthose nerve roots are free and clear of\nany physical pressure from say Hern ated\ndiscs from compressed vertebrae from\ninflammation in those regions maybe all\nthree and what we're really trying to do\nwhen we talk about relieving back pain\noften is creating space creating room\nfor those nerve roots to travel in and\nout of the spine for those messages to\ncome in from the periphery the skin the\ntendons the muscles Etc up into the\nbrain because the brain needs that\ninformation to know where our limbs are\nstill needs to keep us safe as well as\nthe nerve Pathways traveling out of the\nspine that control our musculature for\ndeliberate movements unconscious\nmovements and so on and so much of what\nyou'll hear about today when thinking\nabout how to build a really strong\npain-free back is about creating the\nkind of stability around the spine so\nthat we can engage in the different limb\nmovements that we need to but to do so\nin a way that doesn't create compression\nof those nerve Pathways now with all\nthat said it's really important to also\nunderstand that not all of back pain is\nneural in nature now technically all\npain is neural in the sense that it's a\nperception okay if you listen to the\nepisode with Dr Shawn Macky which\nincludes a deep description of the\nbiopsychosocial model of pain it will\ntell you or I'll just tell you now that\nindeed pain involves a lot of different\nthings it involves psychology it\ninvolves prediction it involves history\nit involves inflammation it involves a\nlot of things and yes ultimately it's\nneural it is the firing of nerves that\ncreate the perception of pain and your\nperception of pain is also the firing of\nneurons in your brain and spinal cord\nhowever what you'll also learn today is\nthat there are many things that you can\ndo including creating stability of your\nfeet your toes believe it or not the\nposition of your pelvis your neck your\nchin all these things as well as the\nspinal erector muscles in your lower\nback as well as your abdominal region\nyour so-called core all of those things\ncombine to create a millu for the spine\nand back to function at its best so if\nnow you're getting overwhelmed you're\nthinking my goodness we have to learn\nabout the entire body's physiology and\nanatomy in order to understand back pain\nand strengthening to some extent that's\ntrue but really all we've said so far\nand all you need to know or keep in mind\nthat is is we have the vertebrae the\nBony segments that surround the spinal\ncord in between those we have the discs\nthe soft tissue that also have a hole\nthrough them the spinal cord travels\nthrough that so that the vertebrae can\nmove so that we have some pliability and\nMobility our spine forward flexion so\nyour chin closer to your belly extension\nyour chin back and away from your belly\nsort of arching of the lower back you\ncan twist to side to side to some extent\nyou have all that stuff and through the\nmiddle is the spinal cord and the brain\nand then you have sensory information\ngoing into the spinal cord from the body\nfrom the muscles from the skin and then\nyou have motor commands going out the\nbottom of the spinal cord so literally\ntraveling out past those vertebrae and\ndiscs out to the muscles to control\nthose muscles for involuntary and\nvoluntary movement if you can understand\nthat and you can Envision it just a\nlittle bit even just a little bit you're\ngoing to be able to think about all of\nthe various protocols that we talk about\nnext in the most functional way meaning\nas you learn about and hopefully\nincorporate the various protocols for\nstrengthening and pain proofing your\nback that you'll occasionally think back\nto okay it's my spinal cord that I'm\nbending in my lower back region I'm\nallowing the discs to kind of move\nforward and they likely are kind of\nbulging out a little bit they're not\nnecessarily herniating let's hope not\nbut they're bulging a little bit in that\ndirection then back in the other\ndirection and if you happen to have\nherniated that is bulging discs which\nmany people do in fact I've had that\nI've got a sort of an L3 a kind of\nLumbar 34 bulge that got activated a few\nyears ago I'll tell you what allowed me\nto very quickly fix that permanently\nwith no medication no surgery whatsoever\nand it was extremely debilitating\nthere's some simple movements that one\ncan do if done in the proper direction\nand in the proper way that can allow you\nto push that bulged that herni disc back\nunder or I should say closer to the\nspinal cord okay moving it from the kind\nof bulging out from between the\nvertebrae to closer again toward the\ncenter point of the spine by doing that\none can take pressure off of the nerve\nroots that are traveling out to the\nmuscles and in from the skin and other\nsensory information coming into the\nspinal cord and allow yourself relief\nfrom back pain and then by building up\nstability in the abdominal region the\nlower back region you can create a nice\nfirm core that will allow you to protect\nall of that with plenty of space so the\nnerve roots are not impinged and then of\ncourse by focusing on some of the\nstabilizers that exist really distal\nwhich means far from all of that further\nfrom all of that such as the feet\nliterally how you position your feet the\nability to spread your toes believe or\nnot as a way to provide support for your\nback not just when doing exercise but\nalso at rest there are some things you\ncan do about neck positioning\nstrengthening of the front of the neck\nstrengthening of various muscles again\nthat involves no equipment whatsoever\nthat allows you to have a pain-free\nstrong back both at rest and during\nmovements of different kind different\nDynamic sport movements like tennis or\ngolf Etc as well as if you're into it\nresistance training if you're putting\nyourself under heavy loads all of that\npainfree and moving through life with a\ntremendous amount of mobility and\nversatility now before we get into the\nspecific protocols and exercises for\nstrengthening and pain proofing your\nback it's worth mentioning something\nthat really was first told to me by Dr\nStuart McGill again he's going to be a\nguest on this podcast Dr Stuart Mill is\na world expert in spine physiology and\nanatomy and he's worked with a lot of\nathletes but his work is not specific to\nathletes it's really for the everyday\nperson as well and in discussions with\nStu he raises some really important\npoints first of all if you have back\npain you need a proper assessment and\ndiagnosis it's really possible for me in\nthis format to try and diagnose your\nback pain or for you to try and diagnose\nyour back pain that would just be\nirresponsible of both of us there's just\nso many things that are specific to each\ncircumstance for instance some people\nget back pain or neck pain or both\nbecause of overuse of certain motor\npatterns maybe they are Avid golf\nplayers and they're always swinging a\ncertain way with one foot forward that's\ntypically the way it works and they\nbuilt up some strength in certain\nPathways both muscular strength and\nneural strength but they have a weakness\nin the opposite side muscles and nerves\nand they need to rehabilitate those in\norder to eliminate the back pain other\npeople have an injury right they have a\nspinal compression injury they don't\njust have a herni disc they have a\nruptured disc often time ruptured discs\nneed surgery I don't want to give the\nimpression that all back pain can be\nresolved without surgery there are cases\nwhere surgery is necessary okay so it's\nvery important that if you have severe\nback pain or persistent back pain and\nyou're not able to alleviate it with\nnon-surgical methods that you talk to a\nback expert perhaps even a surgeon there\nare cases for epidurals for painkillers\nfor you know different types of\nrehabilitative approaches but Dr Stu\nMill has also pointed out that there are\na number of things that any and all of\nus can do by just self assessing that I\nthink are appropriate for today's\ndiscussion that relate to whether or not\nwe are likely to have a thick spine or a\nthin spine okay this isn't a\npsychological feature at least not to my\nknowledge but if you look at different\nbody types you know what in the old days\nused to be called the Ecto endo and\nmomor body types okay this nomenclature\nisn't used quite as much anymore but\njust to kind of return to it the\nectomorphic body phenotype is one in\nwhich people are typically kind of light\nBon meaning thinner wrists smaller knees\nsmaller ankles so not really thick bones\nand thick wrists so as the ectomorph\nthese are people that tend to be pretty\nthin sometimes referred to as people\nthat have you know very low body fat\nless muscle mass although that's not\nalways the case just think lighter\nthinner skeleton versus myomorph which\ntend to be people with kind of thicker\nwrists thicker knee joints have a\nthicker overall and then endomorph which\nwas at the time used to describe people\nthat are carrying more body weight in\nthe form of body fat I don't know how\noften the endomorphin type um language\nis used anymore but what Dr stmill has\npointed out is that people in general\ntend to be more ectomorphic or myomorph\nthey tend to be more thick through the\nTorso or thin through the tors so they\ntend to have thinner wrist or smaller\nwrists as compared to their age matched\nsex matched counterparts okay but in\ngeneral so these are generalizations\npeople who have thicker wrists generally\nare going to have thicker spinal\nsegments okay in terms of the\ncircumference of the spinal segments and\ndiscs whereas people with smaller wrists\nsmaller joints smaller ankles are going\nto have thinner spine so thinner\nvertebrae thinner discs between them and\nso on now neither is good or bad they\nare just different and they create a\nsituation where people have different\nneeds in order to build a strong\npain-free spine so for instance people\nwho have thick spinal segments so these\nare people who tend to be more Barrel\nchested thick through the Torso maybe\nthicker wrists and ankles and knees have\nthicker spinal segments and therefore\nmay not need quite as much buildup of\nthe musculature around their spine in\norder to handle vertical loads okay\ncompression along the spinal length\nbecause they have those big thick spinal\nsegments and discs it's not to say that\nthey don't need to do any spinal\nstrengthening they do but they are\ngenerally going to be very stable along\nthe I'm calling it the vertical axis but\nalong the length of the spine those\npeople perhaps not surprisingly are not\ngoing to be as Mobile in terms of the\ntwisting and bending of the spine\nmeaning spine Mobility along the\ndifferent axes apart from that vertical\naxis that I was referring to along the\nlength of the spine but twisting and\nbending is going to be harder for them\nnow at the opposite extreme you're going\nto have people with smaller RIS\nsmaller ankles smaller knees and they in\ngeneral are going to have a thinner\nspine meaning vertebrae and discs that\nare smaller in circumference and they\nare not going to have the capacity to\nsustain as much vertical compression\nalong the length of the spine as\nsomebody with thick spinal segments but\nthey are going to be more quote unquote\nbendy if you will now that doesn't\nalways mean more flexibility what I'm\nreferring to here is a capacity or a\npotential for the ability to generate\nmovements in which the spine is twisting\nfrom side to side with more ease than\nwould be the powerlifter so imagine at\nthe extremes the thick torso and spine\nof the powerlifter of the shot putter\nsomebody like that versus the spine of\nsay the yoga teacher the dancer they\nhave these smaller wrists smaller pelvis\nsmaller knees Etc but they're going to\nhave more ability to twist themselves\ntheir spine so imagine just kind of like\nbending over to the side a little bit\nwhile looking up the spine is going to\ndo that very easy easily as compared to\nthe person with a thicker torso in spine\nthese two distinctions and here I'm\nreally making them polarized\ndistinctions and in reality there's a\nwhole distribution of thick spine very\nthick spine moderately thick spine thin\nspine ultra thin spine and so on but at\nthese two extremes you can start to\nimagine that each of those spines each\nof those backs probably has different\nrequirements in order to make it strong\nand pain prooof depending on the\nactivities that those people are engaged\nin now of course a thin spine person can\ndecide to powerlift that can be very\ngood for them and indeed one of the\nthings that somebody with a thin spine\nshould do according to Dr Stu Mill and\nI'll reiterate this several times today\nis build up the musculature around the\nspine so that they can stabilize that\notherwise bendy spine along both the\nvertical and side to side axis so they\ndon't injure it they want to make it\nstrong as well as the person with the\nthick spine who can tolerate heavy loads\naround one axis but maybe needs to\ngenerate more mobility of that spine so\nthat they don't go reaching for glass up\nin the cupboard and all of a sudden they\nhave compression of a nerve root coming\nout the spine because they just Twisted\nit to the side by about 5 to 7° both\ngroups have specific needs meaning\nspecific protocols that they can\nemphasize to a greater or lesser degree\nin order to strengthen and pain prooof\ntheir spine so while we can't do an\nassessment of spinal pain and your exact\nneeds for your particular body type in\nthis kind of format through the tunnel\nof the internet you can take a look at\nyourself or just think about yourself\nand think oh do I tend to have thicker\nwrist knees elbows Etc am I more of a\nyou know kind of thick torso person or\ndo I tend to be someone who's more Li\nwho's more you know small wristed\nsomebody who can move from side to side\nwith a lot of ease but probably can't\nhandle as much what I was calling\nvertical load along the length of the\nspine and some people have a kind of\nmixed phenotype not purely Ecto not\npurely\nmyomorph I can say that about myself I\nhave fairly long limbs in fact I have\nlike almost sort of like Gibbon arms I\nhave this kind of really long reach so\nmore kind of um ectomorphic\num arms and at the same time I have a\nshort torso and I am fairly thick\nthrough the circumference of my torso\nI've always been like that even before I\nstarted doing any kind of resistance\ntraining my legs are somewhere in\nbetween okay so I don't have small knees\nor small ankles they're kind of moderate\nin that way my wrists and my arms\nprobably a bit more ectomorphic not\nstrong ectomorphic phenotype but then my\ntorso is a short torso and it's kind of\nthick through the circumference that's\njust the way that my genetics landed me\ninto the world you have genetics that\nlanded you into the world in a\nparticular way you can take a look at\nthese kind of external phenotypes about\njoint size and kind to do an assessment\njust thinking about it and by doing that\nyou'll be able to know which protocols\nwhich we're about to talk about you may\nwant to emphasize or deemphasize in\norder to best strengthen and pain prooof\nyour back so a good analogy that Dr\nStuart McGill offers when thinking about\nthis thin spine versus thick spine thing\nis if you think about a willow tree\nwhich has essentially a a thin trunk and\nthin branches relative to say an oak\ntree or redwood tree the willow tree\ntrunk and branches can bend to quite a\nconsiderable degree without breaking so\nit's just very bendy from side to side\nbut they are thin and they can't sustain\na lot of vertical pressure a lot of\nloads from top to bottom or else they'll\nsimply collapse they might not snap to\nthe point of breaking but they will\ndefinitely Bend to the point of not\nbeing able to bend back\nas opposed to the trunk and branches of\na full-grown oak tree or redwood tree\nwhich are very thick and very strong and\ncan sustain a lot of loads from top to\nbottom along this vertical axis but if\nthey Bend even just a tad too far from\none side to the next they're going to\nsnap and essentially break off so while\nthat analogy isn't a perfect one to\nexplain the situation with thin spines\nversus thick spines I think it gives you\na mental image of the general situation\nfor which some people who have the more\nWillow like spine probably need to build\nmore musculature around the spine in\norder to stabilize it but probably don't\nhave to do quite as much work in order\nto generate more side to side\nflexibility as opposed to people who\nhave a thicker spine who probably don't\nneed to do quite as much work to develop\nthe musculature of the spinal Erectors\nof the abdominals it's not to say they\ndon't need to develop those at all they\ndo but that they don't need to do quite\nas much work to build the musculature\naround the spine in order to stabilize\nit for vertical loads but they perhaps\nwant to do more work aimed at generating\nmore flexibility in these planes of\nmotion from side to side and at\ndifferent angles you know relative to\nthe vertical axis and again most people\ndon't fall at either extreme of Willow\nlike or Redwood like most people are\ngoing to fall somewhere in the middle\nand as I mentioned before many of us\nincluding myself have a sort of\ncombination of more Thin musculature and\nThick musculature depending where in the\nbody you look\nI'd like to take a brief break and\nacknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now most\nof you have heard me tell my story about\nhow I've been taking ag1 once or twice a\nday every day since 2012 and indeed\nthat's true I started taking ag1 and I\nstill take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed Whole\nFoods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning and often\ntimes also again in the afternoon or\nevening I'm ensuring that I'm getting\neverything I need I'm covering all of my\nfoundational nutritional needs and I\nlike so many other people that take ag1\nregularly just report feeling better and\nthat shouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nSL huberman so now let's discuss the\nprotocols that allow you to strengthen\nyour back the first three of these\nProtocols are the so-called McGill's big\nthree named after Dr Stuart McGill who\nagain has done a tremendous amount of\nwork in the research and practical realm\nand has developed a number of different\nprotocols for strengthening and\ndepainting the spine but has distilled\ndown three specific protocols that\neveryone I spoke to in the PT community\nin the MD Community for those that\nspecialize on spine and in the sports\nCommunity as well as people who don't\nplay sports but are simply interested in\nhaving a healthy spine for sake of daily\nMobility all agree are extremely useful\nfor everybody to carry out now the one\ncaveat is that Stu Mill himself has told\nme that he doesn't want the big three to\nbe viewed as the Beall end all of back\nstrengthening and Pain Relief by no\nmeans is it exhaustive to do just the\nbig three so I'm also going to include a\nbunch of other protocol calls that are\ngleaned from other practitioners and\nthat Dr McGill often offers himself in\nhis books and I'll certainly put links\nin the show note captions to his books\nand again he'll be a guest on this\npodcast but for sake of clarity and\nsimplicity The Big Three are as follows\nthe first is called the curl-up the\ncurl-up is in many ways a replacement\nfor the situp most people are familiar\nwith ab crunches and sit-ups where you\nlie down typically people will bend\ntheir knees although not always they'll\noften put their hands behind their head\nor on their chest and then they'll\nessentially sit up to contract the\nabdominals turns out that if you have\nback pain and even if you don't that is\nprobably the least efficient and perhaps\neven the worst thing that you can do for\nyour back pain and if you think about\nthe discs that sit between those\nvertebrae remember those soft tissue\ndiscs that allow for some mobility of\nthe spine well if you Happ have a disc\nthat's bulging even slightly that is\nit's herniating it's getting pushed out\nfrom between the vertebrae and it's\nimpinging on a nerve and there's some\npain\nif you are crunching you can imagine\nthat's essentially bringing the\nvertebrae together in the front of that\nsandwich that is vertebra disc vertebrae\nand what it's going to do is it's going\nto have that disc bulge out even further\nit's going to herniate even further and\nimpinge on those nerves even further so\nwhat's required in a situation where you\nwant to strengthen the back or try and\neliminate or reduce pain of the back is\na way in which you can strengthen the\nabdominals because the abdominals and\nthe abdominal wall is very important for\nstabilizing the spine and you want a\nstable spine that's a very important\npoint but you want to do it in a way\nwhere you're not adding to the\nherniation of the disc in any way so the\ncurl up is an excellent exercise for\npeople who have back pain and who don't\nhave back pain to strengthen the\nabdominal wall and it's done as follows\nyou lie down you put one knee up meaning\none leg is bent the other leg is\nextended you put your hand both hands\nbelow the lower portion of your back so\nin the arch of your back and you\nactually want to maintain the arch of\nyour back that's one of the reasons your\nhands are there the head is in a neutral\nposition okay so your chin isn't tucked\ntoward your chest the chin is in a\nneutral position and this is important\nyour tongue is on the roof of your mouth\nthis is something I talked a little bit\nabout in my description of neck\nexercises in a previous video we're\ngoing to get back to this but tongue on\nthe roof of the mouth often puts the\nhead into a safe default position it\nalso allows for breathing in particular\nnasal breathing to be done very easily\nso you got your tongue on the roof of\nyour mouth the mouth is typically closed\nand then what you do is you raise your\nelbows off the ground and then while\nmaintaining that small of the back\nyou're going to just raise your upper\nchest you're going to lead with the\nupper chest not with the chin and head\nalthough of course the head will follow\nyou're going to raise the upper chest\nmeaning raise the upper torso so the\nhead's going to move forward and you're\ngoing to Exhale and contract the\nabdominals for anywhere from 8 to 10\nseconds okay so you get a very strong\ncontraction of the abdominals but you're\nnot doing a full situp you're only\ncoming up maybe about I don't know\nsomewhere between 5 to 10° so your back\nis coming up the head is coming up and\nthe chin is not moving towards the chest\nit's staying in a neutral position\nyou're going to repeat that so meaning\nyou're going to go up contract for 8 to\n10 seconds you're going to contract the\nabdominal walls if you want to Exhale\nyou can usually get a stronger\ncontraction of the abdominal walls and\nthen you're going to go back down and\nrelax on the floor maybe rest 10 to 30\nseconds maybe a minute and then repeat\nokay so that's the basic movement and\nthen you would switch to the other side\nmeaning you're then going to extend the\nleg that was bent you're going to bend\nthe other leg and you're going to repeat\nin terms of sets and repetitions\ntypically the best way to do this is to\ndo anywhere from three to five sets\nstarting with 10-second contractions\ndone five times for the first set so it'\nbe 10sec\nhold then relax 10-c hold then relax\ndoing that five times maybe four times\nbut five would be ideal that would be\none set and then on the next set you're\ngoing to do four repetitions meaning\nfour 10-second holds with rest in\nbetween and then on the next one three\non the next one two and the next one one\n10c hold or so these are just rough\nguidelines you certainly don't have to\ndo quite as long holds as those if you\ncan't do those you don't have to do all\nof those sets if you find you're\nfatiguing one of the advantages however\nof doing these brief 10-second holds and\nreally focusing on the contraction of\nthe abdominals hard or as hard as you\ncan and then releasing is that as\nopposed to doing a long hold just trying\nto hold as long as you can and building\na lot of endurance in the abdominals\nwhen you repeatedly contract a\nneuromuscular connection you build the\npathways you basically allow the\npathways that can engage those strong\nmuscular contractions to a greater\ndegree than if you're trying to just\nstatically hold that particular position\nfor a very very long time like 30\nseconds or 60 seconds or longer okay now\nthere are a bunch of different\nvariations of the curl up you can do the\ncurl up with the extended leg elevated\nslightly to make it harder you can do\nthe curl up with your elbows positioned\ncloser to the ceiling so you're you're\nreally lifting your elbows and arms far\noff the the ground as opposed to having\nthem just hovering right above the\nground there a bunch of different\nvariations of these we include links to\na few short videos in the show note\ncaption so you can see the different\nvariations of the curl up has me doing\nthese on the floor in my uh typical\nstreet clothes so you don't need to get\ninto workout gear to do these and I\nshould mention that the curl up is\nsomething that you can do every day if\nit occurs to you and if you have the\ntime it's something that you would\ncertainly benefit from doing every day\nbut it's also something that even if you\ndo once or twice a week for for even\njust a couple of sets you're going to\nsee some benefit in terms of\nstrengthening your back and probably\nrelieving some pain of your back as well\nthe other terrific thing about the\ncurl-up is if you have back pain and\ndoing the curl-up doesn't aggravate it\nyou are most certainly doing things to\nstrengthen the musculature around the\nback that's going to help you avoid more\nback pain as you work through the\ndifferent rehabilitative practices that\nhopefully you're doing with a PT or with\na excellent MD who specializes in back\npain relief as the pain dissipates\nyou're going to be building up the\nmusculature of the abdominals that's\ngoing to then further protect your spine\nespecially if you're one of those people\nthat has a thinner spine that needs more\nmuscular support around the spine in\norder to support it just as a final note\nabout the curup two of the most common\nerrors that people make when doing the\ncurl up is to make it more like a situp\nand generate a chin to chest movement\nfirst and let the chest follow you\nreally want the chest to lead and keep\nthe head in a neutral position tongue on\nthe roof of your mouth try and breathe\nthrough your nose and if you find that\nyou can't do the big exhale as you bring\nit up to the top don't worry about it\nit's perfectly fine to hold your breath\nas you come up and then just maybe\nrelease a little bit of air to enhance\nthe uh intensity of that abdominal\ncontraction the second exercise in the\nmill big three is the side plank I\nconfess and I don't know why I hate\ndoing side planks I don't know why I\nhate doing side planks I just hate doing\nside planks which tells me I should do\nside planks so I've started doing some\nside planks recently after talking to Dr\nMill I'm fortunate that right now I\ndon't have back pain I haven't for a\nwhile I'll talk about how I alleviated\nmy back pain but I spend a lot of time\nas a 48-year-old thinking about having a\nstrong spine being able to jump off\nthings and land with confidence all the\nsorts of things that set one up for both\nhealthspan and lifespan as has been\ntaught to us by Dr Peter AA some of you\nmay know Dr Peter AA because he's been a\nguest on this podcast he wrote The\nIncredible Book outlive and he talks\nabout how having a strong spine having\nthe ability to break Falls by virtue of\ntraining your ability to jump down\nthings and step down things with\nconfidence is essential to offset the\naging process so I've decided I'm going\nto do side planks I'm going to embrace\nthe uh spine strengthening exercises\nthat Stu Mill has put forward as the big\nthree and that includes side planks so\nhow do you do side planks well most\npeople think that a side plank is just\ngetting on your side essentially on the\nfloor then putting one arm down and\nstacking your feet on the other side and\ntrying to make yourself as stiff as a\nplank as you possibly can and while that\nis C only one way to do it most people\nfind that they are going to get the most\nin terms of strengthening their spine\nand preventing back pain and maybe even\nalleviating back pain if they build up\nthrough a set of incremental steps\nmaking sure that the form on each of the\nsteps is absolutely perfect so the way\nto really start doing side planks and if\nyou think you can already do side planks\nto assess whether or not you're doing\nthem properly is to start with knees\nslightly bent so maybe at about a 30 or\n40° angle so you're on your side your\nknees are bent the feet are stacked\nyou're of course going to push one arm\ndown although many people find that\nputting their hand in a fist as opposed\nto a flat hand is going to be best I\ndon't know if U most of you are aware of\nthis but anytime that we generate a fist\nin either hand it sets in motion a\nnumber of different neural Pathways that\nallow for a firmer contraction of\nmuscles not just within the fist but\nelsewhere in the body okay if um you've\never heard the great teachings of Pavo\nsusulan who I hope to have on this\npodcast as a guest he's talked about how\nif you were say to try and squeeze a\nmetal bar or think about just trying to\ngive your friend the firmest handshake\nyou possibly can you're having that\nhandshake squeeze competition if you\nmake a fist with your other hand you're\nactually going to be able to generate a\nharder contraction of the shaking hand\nokay of the squeezing hand and this is\nbecause of the way that we have these\nbilaterally U wired uh nerve to muscle\nconnections and the fact that neural\nactivation on one side is related to\nneural activation on the other side and\nso forth but basically what you're going\nto do for the side plank in order to\ngenerate the strongest and most\nefficient side plank for strengthening\nand hopefully depainting your back is to\nget on the side Bend those knees put the\nhand down in a fist position okay then\nyou're going to push the hips off the\nground so the upper body is indeed in a\nplank position then you're going to\nraise the hips up and you're going to\nhave to put some considerable effort\ninto pushing the floor away from you\nthat's really the key here pushing the\nfloor away from you now if you find that\nyou can do that and you can hold that\nposition for a good 8 to 10 seconds with\na strong degree of rigidity so you're\nnot quaking and you're not feeling as if\nthe hips want to collapse down to the\nfloor something you really want to avoid\nespecially if you already have some back\npain or even a subtle back injury you\nwant to make sure that your your spine\nis straight okay and that those hips\ncome off the ground and you're really in\na plank position right no Bend if you\nfind that you can do that and it's\nfairly straightforward for you well then\nfeel free to then extend your feet out\nfurther put the top foot on top of the\nother foot and out to the front Okay so\nyou're not stacking the feet right on\ntop of one another we just shoe on top\nof shoe but you've got or foot on top of\nfoot if you're doing this Barefoot or in\nsocks but you've got one foot in front\nof you for some stability and then\nyou're generating that long side plank\npose and holding that for 8 to 10\nseconds then pause for 10 maybe 30\nseconds if you have to and then repeat\nagain again all that part of one set\njust as we talked about for the curl up\npreviously so you're working through the\nprogression from bent legs to\nstraightening your legs if the top foot\nis placed in front of the other foot\nwith legs straight and that's something\nthat you can do for say anywhere three\nto five repetitions of those 8 to 10\nsecond holds which make up one set well\nthen you have the option to make the\nwhole thing more difficult by doing a\nsort of roll forward where you actually\ntake the part of your shoulders which is\non the side of your free arm so the hand\nthat is not pressing into the floor and\nyou rotate forward so that your chest is\nnow aiming toward the floor maybe not to\na full push-up position but maybe close\nand then back again to the side plank\nwhat you're doing there is you're\nactivating some of the musculature that\nis for rotation of the spine okay and as\nyou do that you're getting closer and\ncloser to a front plank and of course\nfront planks are also an excellent way\nto generate spine stability most people\ncan do a front plank by resting on their\nforearms why start with a side plank\nwell there are a lot of different\nreasons for that but what you'll realize\nis that when you're doing a side plank\nyou're actually only really loading half\nof the spine maximally the other half of\nthe spine is not being loaded maximally\nbecause it's the side of the spine\nthat's that's up and of course that's a\nreason why you want to do these on both\nsides of your body right so what's the\nsets and repetition scheme that's going\nto work here well if you're like me and\nyou loathe doing side planks and you\nfind that they do take a lot more effort\nthan perhaps you would like either\npsychologically or physically then for\nme what I've been doing is one set\nconsists of three 10c holds I've been\ndoing these with knees bent although\nI've now progressed to the point where I\ncan do one foot over the other and\nresting that top foot um across the\nbottom foot so leg straight doing that\nfor three 10-second holds to make up one\nset and doing that for two or three sets\non one side of my body two or three sets\non the other side of my body so slightly\ndifferent than as I described for the\ncurl up where it was descending\nrepetitions where you know the first set\nyou're doing five 10c holds next one 4\n10sec holds next one 3 2 1 for the side\nplanks I don't like them enough that I\njust prefer to do two or three sets of\nthree 10-second hes on each side\nalthough I'm starting to enjoy them just\nenough that I might progress to the kind\nof what's called reverse pyramid where\nyou go five five 4 3 2 1 this sort of\nthing increasing the number of sets and\nagain I have a link in the show note\ncaptions that shows you how the side\nplanks are done in these different\nvariations I should mention that the\nmost common mistake was side planks is\nletting the hips sag so if you don't\npush the floor away from you enough if\nyou're not stable enough through the\nfoot contact with the floor or the leg\ncontact with the floor if you're doing\nthese with knees bent even if you go to\nleg straight and you consider yourself\nvery very strong in the side plank if\nthe hips start to Sag you can imagine\nbased on what you now know about back\nAnatomy right the spinal cord being this\num kind of snake like extension out the\nback of the brain with the vertebrae as\nsegments and the discs in between them\nif that's sagging well especially if you\nhave an issue with a disc bulge and some\nimpingment on one of those nerve Roots\neither coming into or out of the spinal\ncord you're going to get into some\ntrouble meaning it's going to cause some\npain or at least some aggravation so the\ngoal is to get that spine really\nstraight as you're doing the side planks\nregardless of whether or not you're\ndoing that with knees bent or you're\ndoing it with legs straight in fact\nthat's the reason I went through all of\nthat Anatomy earlier so that as you're\ndoing these exercises whether or not\nit's the big three or the other\nprotocols I'll talk about you can really\nEnvision the major components of the\nspine that are getting engaged okay it's\nnot just about the abdominals and the\nobliques and the lower back of course\nit's about all of that that's what\nyou're exercising but you're also\ngetting the neural engagement within the\nspine you should think about the\nvertebral segments the discs the fact\nthat those nerve Roots need to run in\nand out of the spinal cord outp pass the\nBony and disc material and to do that\nwithout impingement so as you do these\nmovements can be very beneficial to\nthink about the different anatomical\nfeatures of the back including spinal\ncord vertebrae discs nerves Etc but\nmainly those and as you're doing that\nyou'll not just be strengthening your\nback you'll also be strengthening your\nlearning of neuroanatomy so the last of\nStu Mill's big three again Stu kind of\ncringes every time people say okay it's\njust Mill's big three and that's back\nstrengthening and Pain Relief and he\nalways just kind of I can tell it pains\nhim uh no pun intended because he knows\nand it's true that there's a lot more\ninvolved in strengthening and pain\nproofing the back but always good to\nhave a great place to start a simple\nplace to start and something that's\nreally tractable without equipment or\nany cost and so we're very grateful that\nStu was willing to kind of resist his\ntemptation to be um Beyond nuanced and\nthorough which he always is and offer us\nthe curl-up the side plank which we've\ncovered and now the third which is the\nbird dog the bird dog as some of you may\nknow is where you get into all fours on\nthe ground you extend one arm forward\nand you extend the opposite one leg\nbackward okay so if you're down on all\nfours and you extend your right hand in\nfront of you you're going to extend your\nleft leg behind you now there are a\ncouple key things about this one is\nagain have the extended hand in a fist\nwhy because you want to generate a\nstrong neural contraction so that you\ndon't forget and in fact facilitate\nkeeping your upper body parallel to the\nfloor so no tilting from side to side as\nbest you can and you also want the\nneural activation to allow you to then\nEngage The Lift of the leg in a way\nthat's also very strong and stable okay\nso nothing floppy no leaks as they say a\nkey point is to make sure you don't\nraise the leg too high you're not trying\nto Arch your lower back in fact what you\nwant to do is raise the hand in front of\nyou generate that fist it can even just\nbe out in front of your your eyes at\nfirst maybe a little bit higher and then\nthe leg that's extending toward the back\nfeel free to either point the toe toward\nthe ground or if you want to extend the\ntoe a little bit like you're doing a\nlittle bit of calf raise in the air\nright pointing your toe that is that's\nfine too but don't get that heel up too\nhigh or even the upper thigh up too high\nthat you're getting a really big arch in\nthe back the idea is to Envision one\nlong line between the extended arm and\nfist all the way back across the midline\nbecause it's to the opposite leg and to\nthe foot behind you again it's about\ncreating a strong stable reach a strong\nstable lift of the foot but not too high\nand this is very important with the hand\nthat remains planted and the knee that\nremains planted pushing the ground away\nfrom you okay that's as important as is\nthe lifting of the arm the clasping of\nthe Fist and the raising of the leg in\nall of these movements the pushing of\nthe ground away from you the resistance\nto gravity is as important as whatever\nmovement you happen to be doing again\nthis is a terrific movement for\nstrengthening the spine that most people\ncan do because you're only working one\nhalf of the musculature on either side\nof the spine okay there's of course\nactivation of the musculature on the\nother side to some degree in order to\nbalance things out but by emphasizing\nonly one half of the musculature a you\ncan really focus on the contractions\nagain you can really put a lot of Mind\ninto the pushing the the floor away you\ncan put your mind into where fist is and\nyour foot is and of course you can\ngenerate the kind of hard contractions\nthat are really going to strengthen\nthose lower back muscles as well as the\nupper back and shoulder muscles that are\nrequired for generating stability of the\nspine again that's really what this is\nall about again it's going to be maybe\nthree to five repetitions of 8 to 10\nsecond holds for one set done for\nrepeated sets maybe for a descending\nnumber of repetitions where you're going\nfive holds four holds three holds two\nholds one hold all of that being done\nrepeatedly and with the greatest amount\nof of intensity and focus so that those\nnerve Pathways can be engaged over and\nover again very easily generating a lot\nof strength of contraction that then of\ncourse carries over into your exercise\nactivities and even just your passive\nactivities throughout the day and even\nstability of the spine while at rest\nwhich is something that we're going to\ntalk about more as we get into some of\nthe other protocols now of course with\nthe bird dog exercise you also need to\ntrain the opposite side of your body so\nafter doing say two to five sets of\nthose two to five repetitions of eight\nto 10 second holds on one side you're\ngoing to want to switch to the other\nside and do the same thing or you could\nalternate you could do right hand\nextended left leg extended do one set\nthen switch to the other side left hand\nextended or I should say left fist\nextended uh right leg extended do those\nrepetitions call that one set and then\nshift back to the other side and so on\nand so forth really depends on how much\ntime you have how frequently you're\ndoing this throughout the week again\nright now I'm striving to do all of stum\nMill's big three at least once a week\nmaybe twice a week I know many of you\nwill say oh that's pretty wimpy you know\nyou should be doing this every single\nday or five times a week well I have a\nbusy schedule just as many of you do and\nit's something that I'm trying to\nincorporate more and more typically at\nthe end of a workout although some\npeople decide to do this at the\nbeginning of a workout right now\nfortunately I'm not dealing with any\nback pain knock on wood but it's\nsomething that for many people who have\nback pain they find that if they do it\nthis at the beginning of a workout it\nallows them to then move into the\nworkout warmed up and to avoid a lot of\nthe back pain they would otherwise\nexperience with that said I want to be\nvery clear that if any of these\nmovements exacerbate your back pain then\nyou should definitely avoid doing them\nand of course if you have back pain you\nshould be working with a licensed\nprofessional to figure out how to treat\nthat back pain you may very well need\npain meds Andor surgery I don't know\nbecause I don't know your specific\ncircumstance but for most people who are\njust trying to strengthen their back who\nperhaps are dealing with a little bit of\nnagging back pain The Big Three are\noften very very accessible meaning they\ndon't exacerbate back pain and in many\ncases they alleviate it sometimes\npartially sometimes completely there are\na lot of wonderful anecdotes out there\nof people who have benefited from doing\nthe big three in all of those categories\nnow again we have a link in the show\nnote captions showing how the bird dog\nexercise is done there are a couple of\nvariations that you can do to make it\nharder one is to draw boxes with the\nextended Fist and the extended foot\nthat's actually a coordination issue too\nfor some people so some people choose to\ndo a box with their hand maybe they do\nit clockwise then they do it\ncounterclockwise some people choose to\ndo the hand and foot moving in a box\ntogether meaning simultaneously\nsometimes they'll alternate foot then\nhand this sort of thing any kind of\nmovement that you're doing with the\nextended Fist and or foot is going to\nadd some degree of difficulty to this\nbut you want to make sure that if you're\ngoing to add those movements those\nprogressions that you're keeping the\npushing away way of the floor constant\nthroughout and that you're keeping your\ntorso parallel to the floor as you go\nnow when I say parallel I realize that\nas you do an extension of one fist or\nthe other fist as you kick out that back\nleg it's going to be near impossible for\nmost people to stay perfectly parallel\nto the floor what you're trying to do\nhowever is to make sure that you're not\nrolling from one side to the next you're\ntrying to make sure that you don't get\ntilted onto the stabilizing shoulder\nhand side okay so that's what's really\nimportant you can also if you really\nwant to make it difficult you can start\nto take the\nextended hand fist that is and reach\nback and then touch the knee that was a\nfew seconds ago extended so you can do\nthat in kind of a kind of reaching back\ntouching the knee then ex re- extending\nthe leg you do that for one side both\nsides Etc again there are a number of\ndifferent progressions that um I do in\nthe video I must say these are\nchallenging for me especially doing more\nthan three sets after you've contracted\nyour muscles really hard in the way that\nyou're supposed to for these exercises\nin the three you're not going to have\nthe sort of fatigue that you experience\nafter sprinting or after doing heavy\ndeadlifts or something of that sort but\nit's a certain kind of fatigue that\nprevents you from performing the\nmovements properly and so the whole\npoint here is to perform the movements\nproperly to build a pattern what\nsometimes called an engram but basically\nit's an activation pattern of nerve to\nmuscle and the resulting limb movements\nthat allow you to do the movements\nperfectly so don't be in a big rush to\ndo tons of this stuff right out the gate\nbe in a rush to do as much of it it as\nyou can perform properly and consider it\na progression and something that you're\ngoing to keep up not just for a week not\njust for a year but it's something that\nyou're going to do for the rest of your\nlife even if that means doing it just\nonce a week or once in a while learn the\nmovements properly that's the most\nimportant thing and of course I'd be\nremiss if I didn't mention the common\nmistakes that people make when they do\nthe bird dog one is people often raise\nthat front fist way too high okay\nthey're reaching for the sky or they're\nkicking way too high in the back they're\ngenerating a sort of bow shape from\nextended fist to Extended back foot\nthat's not good you really want to raise\nthese things up as stiff straight levers\nwhile also maintaining as much as you\ncan parallel to the floor stance and\npushing the floor away this is about\ngenerating strength of contraction and I\nknow the word sounds bad but rigidity\nit's about generating stiffness in the\nspinal muscles and in the abdominal\nmuscles and in the upper back muscles\nand the other muscles that are requ requ\nired for this and when I say stiffness I\ndon't mean a lack of ability for the\nmuscles to move once you're in sport or\nonce you're about your daily activities\nwhat I'm talking about is an ability to\ngenerate a really firm muscular\ncontraction so that those nerve pathways\nare strong so that you can stabilize the\nspine in any number of different\ndimensions and planes and orientations\nas you embark on your daily activities\nsports activities Etc that's what all of\nthis big three stuff is about it's about\nstrengthening the musculature of the\nabdominals of the lower back of the\nshoulders and everything that connects\nit neurally again these are Pathways\nit's something that I should have said\nearlier and didn't which is we often\nexperience pain in a given location like\nlower back pain or pain in the lower\nback and down the hip into the leg but\npain is always the consequence of a\npathway being irritated or a pathway\nbeing activated and in order to\nstrengthen the components around the\nback to strengthen the components of the\nback to avoid pain you want to work\nPathways and so the big three that stum\nmigil has developed is really about\ngenerating the kind of muscular strength\nand stability the neuromuscular\nactivation patterns and doing it in a\nway that is generally safe for most\npeople to perform to get the strongest\nand most painfree back possible and what\nI just described might sound like a lot\nof exercise it's actually something that\nif you decide to just include one or two\nsets of each of those curl up side plank\nbird dog you could complete in anywhere\nfrom 5 to 10 minutes again if done once\na week or twice a week whereas a warm up\nbefore you know weightlifting or at the\nend say a cardiovascular training\nsession maybe even while watching TV or\nlistening to a podcast or something of\nthat sort it actually doesn't take that\nmuch time at all and of course doesn't\nrequire any equipment and it can be done\nessentially work or street clothes I'd\nlike to take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors plunge\nplunge makes what I believe is the best\nself-cooling cold water plunge over the\nlast decade and especially in The Last 5\nYears there's been an increasing amount\nof excitement about cold water plunging\nfor sake of mental health physical\nhealth and performance and that's in\nlarge part because one of the most\nrobust effects of cold water exposure\nare big increases in Adrenaline also\ncalled epinephrine and dopamine so while\nsome people do cold water plunging in\npursuit of increasing metabolism or\nreducing inflammation it's really those\nbig increases in Adrenaline and dopamine\nthat lead to those long- lasting\nincreases in alertness and feelings of\nwell-being not just in the seconds or\nminutes after the cold plunge but indeed\nfor several hours afterwards I've been\nusing a plunge for several years now\ntypically first thing in the morning or\nafter cardiovascular training I do agree\nthat doing cold water plunging after a\nworkout design to generate hypertrophy\nor strength gains is not a good idea but\ndoing cold plunging at the other times\nof day can be tremendously beneficial I\nuse the version of plunge called the\nall-in ice bath and plunge now also\nmakes saunas that get up to 230° fah I\nlove how the plunge ice bath and sauna\ncan both be controlled from an app on my\nphone so that if I'm headed home I can\nturn on the sauna and it'll be hot when\nI arrive so if you would like to try a\nplunge ice bath or sauna you can go to\nplunge. comom huberman to get $150 off\neither product again that's plunge.\ncomom huberman okay so before I get into\nsome of the other protocols for\nstrengthening the back which largely\ncenter around building strength into the\nstabilizing muscles and parts of the\nbody that allow the spine to move\nthrough different planes of motion\nsafely I want to talk about two\nprotocols that one can use to alleviate\nback pain that many people find\nbeneficial now all this goes back to\nthis thing about vertebrae dis vertebrae\nright that's the alternating sequence\nalong the length of the spine and again\nthe vertebrae are bony tissue so it's\nhard stuff the discs are a softer all\nright it's got some durability to it but\nit's a softer tissue but it allows for\npliability of the spine because it's a\nsoft tissue so imagine an Oreo cookie\nsomething that um I'm not a fan of\neating um I don't like the way they\ntaste and I'm told uh they're probably\nnot good for us but in any case if you\nlike Oreos or you don't it's a good\nanalogy here where you've got the two\ncookies and the cream Center so the two\ncookies are analogous to the vertebrae\nhere and the cream Center is analogous\nto the disc if you squeeze the cookies\nevenly from top to bottom the cream\nCenter is going to move out towards all\nsides along the full circumference right\nso all the white stuff is going to move\ntowards the edges more or less equally\nif you squeeze just on one side right\nthe cream filling is going to move out\ntoward one side if you squeeze on the\nother side cream filling and move out\ntoward the other side and of course if\nyou were to crush the cookies from top\nand bottom or even just the top cookie\nor the bottom cookie the cream filling\nis going to go up and through that will\nbe equivalent to the rupturing of the\ndisc along that Dimension okay why am I\nmentioning this well as I said before a\nlot not all but a lot of back pain has\nto do with compression or impingement of\nnerves at some point along a pathway\nsometimes multiple points along a\npathway and one of the most common\nsources of back pain is when those discs\nare bulging they're herniating and\nthey're impinging on a faasle of nerves\na bundle of nerves so two of the things\nthat many people find beneficial when\nthey're experiencing back pain are first\nif you can find a bar or something that\nyou can hang from but don't worry you're\nnot going to have to actually hang in a\nfull dead hang position if you don't\nhave the strength for that or even if\nyou do the idea here is to get your arms\noverhead onto a bar you're holding on to\nthe bar and your legs are going to drape\ndown and your toes are going to be in\ncontact with the floor so we're not\ntalking about a dead hang here okay\nwhich actually requires that you engage\nsome muscles that can actually aggravate\nback pain what you're doing here is\nyou're going to hold on to the bar\nyou're in more or less a hang except\nthat your toes are supporting you or\nyour feet or sometimes your heels are\nsupporting you what you're trying to do\nis get lengthening of the spine\nbasically what you're doing is the\nopposite of pressing down on those\nspinal discs and you're going to do that\nfor anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds\nyou're not going to twist okay you could\nimagine how twisting of the spine could\nbe bad depending on where the Bulge is\nand which nerves are being impinged what\nyou're trying to do is just create\nlength along the spine to relieve some\nof that disc bulging which is impinging\non the nerves again without knowing the\nsource of your back pain it's impossible\nto know whether or not this will help or\nit won't but many people get some degree\nof Pain Relief by doing this of course\nyou need to be cautious in how you do it\nyou don't want to hang for a long time\nif you don't have the strength to do\nthat while trying to find the distance\nto the floor with your toes you're going\nto want to progress toward this very\ncarefully but this is something that\nmany people find beneficial it's also\nthe kind of logic behind you know\ninversion tables and these um kind of\nlook more like um kind of chair apparati\nwhere people uh have designed chairs\nthat then can invert so that people can\nrelieve some of the pressure on their\nspine I've personally never tried those\ninversion chairs I did used to have an\ninversion table that I had out on my\ndeck in the morning and I like to you\nknow lock my ankles in and and invert on\nthat thing it was kind of fun keep in\nmind if you're going to do any kind of\ninversion you are going to generate\nintracranial pressure if you're somebody\nand I feel obligated to say this because\nI'm a vision scientist and I worked on\nglaucoma for a number of years which is\nintraocular pressure if you have\nglaucoma or you're predisposed to\nglaucoma you're going to increase ocular\npressure if you're inverted in that way\nor anyway so keep that in mind you would\nwant to avoid that in those cases but\nfor many people just generating some\ndegree of lengthening of the spine by\nhanging from a bar or from some other\nphysical object that's sturdy while\nkeeping your toes or your feet or your\nheels in contact with the floor so\nyou're just kind of lightly touching\nthere so you can keep that going for\nanywhere from 10 to 30 seconds and then\njust kind of relax let go you walk\naround a little bit and then repeat\ndoing that two or three times many\npeople experience some degree of pain\nrelief from doing that for all the\nreasons that now should be logical and\nobvious to you based on your\nunderstanding of spine anatomy and\nphysiology that we talked about earlier\nand the general theme of just trying to\nrelieve compression that is herniation\nof the discs now what about reversing\nherniation of the discs okay so this is\nsomething I'm very familiar with and I\nhave an anecdote here that of course\njust relates to my experience so it\ncertainly doesn't carry over to\neverybody but it's an experience that\nI've shared with a number of people\nwho've also experienced lower back pain\nto some degree of success and the story\ngoes as follows a few years ago when I\nwas in Seattle giving a talk I decided\nto go to the gym that morning and I did\nan exercise which was not a deadlift it\nwasn't anything spinal really it was\nkind of a reverse bench dip that I do\nfor my triceps I've always enjoyed doing\nthese I've always um been able to do\nthese completely painfree but that\nmorning I got ambitious and I put a\ncouple um plates on my lap in order to\ndo them and I don't know exactly when it\nhappened but as I was doing these bench\ndips with the weight on my lap something\nfelt like it quote unquote went in my\nback something something felt off I I\ndon't know what happened but it felt\nlike a little kind of like a little pull\nor something of that sort and when I\nstood up felt okay and then as I started\nto walk around a little bit more and\nwent through my workout I thought uhoh\nsomething happened back there this is\nnot good and what essentially was\nhappening is I was experiencing pain on\nmy kind of lower and mid right side of\nmy back down the hip so intense pain at\nthe hip socket and down the leg kind of\nwhat some people might describe as\nclassic s Attica or something similar to\nthat I thought oh goodness this is not\ngood as the morning progressed I was\nhaving a harder and harder time not\nwalking walking was okay but if I sat\ndown and then I need to stand up it was\nincredibly painful and I thought oh no\nthis is it I really did something bad to\nmy back so much so that I was literally\nbent over at about 20 or 30 degrees\nwalking back to the Space Needle in\nSeattle cuz we were giv the talks um up\nin the one of the rooms there I don't\nknow if it was the top room one of the\nrooms at the Space Needle and I could\nbarely walk up to the Space Needle I was\njust you know hunched over it was\nmiserable now eventually what happened\nwas I was able to fly home I was in a\nton of pain I started reaching out to\ncolleagues of mine that work on the back\nthat understand pain they were\nsuggesting painkillers I personally like\nto avoid taking painkillers unless I\nhave to take them and I basically don't\ntake them I might take an aspirin every\nonce in a while but I really like to\navoid taking painkillers that's just me\nI don't judge those that need painkill\nbut basically in talking to Medical\ncolleagues I thought okay maybe I'm\ngoing to need a corticosterone shot\nmaybe I'm going to need to just weight\nit out and keep in mind that a lot of\nback pain does relieve itself if people\njust wait it out and avoid the movement\nor movements that caused or exacerbate\nthat back pain this is something really\nimportant to know a lot of back pain\nwill just relieve over time but I wanted\nto stay active so I started reading\nonline as one does and I even started\ndoing some abdominal strengthening\nexercises at the time I wasn't aware of\nthe curl-up and instead what I was doing\nwas some crunches so I was doing sit-ups\nwhich you guessed it made things way way\nworse for the obvious reasons it was\nactually causing more of bulging of the\ndiscs that were impinging on those\nnerves bulging out the I guess it would\nbe the back side of the back the\nposterior side of the back at the time I\ndidn't really understand dis anatomy and\nvertebral anatomy in a way that would\ntell me that the sit-ups were going to\ncause that problem but they were making\nit worse and worse eventually I cross P\nwith a PT who said absolutely stop doing\nany abdominal crunching just stop you're\nmaking it much much worse he explained\nto me that the discs were bulging at\nabout the L3 L4 region you look up where\nthat is and then it was impinging on the\nnerve which was causing the pain both in\nthe back at the hip socket down the leg\nwhat did he suggest I do he suggested\nthat I do essentially the opposite of a\nsitup basically that I lie down on the\nfloor with toes extended legs together\nand then do essentially a push-up while\nkeeping my hips in contact with the\nfloor so you might think of this kind of\nas an up dog or a cobra pose in yoga um\nalthough not so much extending the head\nlooking up at the ceiling but keeping\nthe head in a neutral position and then\ndoing anywhere from 8 to 10 repetitions\nof those and then holding the final\nrepetition for as long as I could until\nI started to Quake a little bit and then\nrelaxing onto the floor what was\nremarkable is that from the very first\nset of those that I did I started to\nexperience some degree of pain relief\nnot total pain relief but some degree of\npain relief and what he suggested I do\nand what of course I did was to do those\nessentially Cobra push-ups or I don't\nknow really what to call them again it's\nhips in contact with the floor toes\npointed back legs straight pushing back\nessentially what he was having me do was\nto try and work that disc bulge back\ninto the more vertical alignment of the\nspinal column I realize that's not the\nexact nomenclature so all you pts and\nchyros and physios are probably cringing\nat this point but for the common\nlistener what we were trying to do was\nget the cream of the Oreo cookie from\nstopping to squeeze out from the back of\nfrom between those cookies and back\nunder those cookies so to speak and what\nI found and this was just remarkable was\nthat within two maybe three days the\npain was almost completely gone almost\ncompletely gone which was to me just\nstaggering no pain medication I mean\nprior to this I was thinking oh goodness\nI'm going to need corticosteroid\ninjection I'm going to have to take pain\nmeds I might even need surgery I mean I\nwas compl completely debilitated now of\ncourse we don't have the control\nexperiment where I didn't do these\nexercises and I did nothing so we don't\nknow how fast it would have relieved\nitself had I just done nothing so that's\nan important caveat to all of this and\nagain this is just my experience but the\nreason I'm sharing this experience is\nnot because I necessarily think that you\nshould be doing these same exercises to\nrelieve a disc bulge and the pain that\nresults from it but to give you a sense\nof how the disc bulging and the\nimpingement on the nerve is very often\nthe cause of back pain and you want to\nabsolutely avoid doing anything that\nexacerbates that disc bulge so in my\ncase it meant avoiding doing any\ncrunching because that would send the\ncream from between the two Oreo cookies\nfurther and further out impinging on the\nnerve more and more and more creating\nmore and more pain rather to try and\npush things back by doing a spinal\nextension by doing creating an arch in\nthe lower back by doing these\nessentially uh Cobra push-ups from the\nfloor and when talking with this PT\nagain and telling him gosh the back pain\nis essentially removed this is amazing\nI'm back to exercising walking running\nin the very same week he said yes indeed\nsome people have so much back pain that\nthey can't even do the Cobra type\npush-up they need to just go to a wall\nand actually just put their hands on the\nwall standing about six inches or so\naway from the wall and then just push\ntheir hips towards the wall okay yeah I\nacknowledge kind of an odd visual there\nbut pushing their hips towards the wall\nwhile keeping their you know arms bent\nand their torso you know anywhere from 6\nto 12 in from the wall and then\neventually progressing to be being able\nto do these Cobra type push-ups or up\ndogs whatever you want to call them on\nthe floor I again will provide a link in\nthe show note captions of how these are\ndone I found these to be tremendously\nbeneficial not just when I have back\npain because yes indeed couple years\nlater I did something else in the gym I\nwasn't training particularly heavy and\nthat same L3 L4 thing started again and\nI started doing these right away and it\nresolved it right away okay so clearly\nit works for me but one of the things\nthat's really been key for me is to\nunderstand that I have a propensity for\na disc bulge a herniation in that region\nI now know what direction the disc bulge\ngoes therefore which exercis is to avoid\nbecause they exacerbate that herniation\nof the discs and which exercises to\nemphasize because they help alleviate\nthe herniation of that disc and this is\nwhy a little bit later I'm going to talk\nabout some of the protocols that you can\nincorporate into your resistance\ntraining things like posterior chainwork\nlike glute ham raises Nordic curls and\nthings of that sort that if you're like\nme and you're prone to slight herniation\nof the discs in the direction towards\nthe posterior side right that it's very\nimportant to build up the musculature\nthat surrounds those discs so that one\ncan avoid herniating them further so\nagain this is my experience you if you\nhave back pain I would hope not but if\nyou have back pain it might be a\nherniation toward the anterior side of\nyour spine right it might be herniation\nin the direction of spine flexion and so\ntherefore you need to do different\nexercises the point is that you need to\nunderstand what the origin of the pain\nis but I also offer this story because\nI've known several people one of whom is\nin my family who experienced back pain\nfought they need to get corticosteroid\ninjections actually got those injections\ngot some degree of pain relief which is\nnot surprising but then the pain came\nback okay it turns out they had a herni\ndisc in the same kind of area and\ngeneral category of posterior you know\ncream of the cookie going out the back\nright towards the back as I did thought\nthat my anecdote about the herni disc\nand these you know push-ups and these\nwall push-ups and pushing one's pelvis\ntowards the wall was kind of goofy and\nyou know wasn't really Medical but\nwhat's very interesting is when they\nthen traveled to Europe to Scandinavia\nfor the summer living there their\nScandinavian and spoke to a physician\nthere the instruction from that MD that\nphysician was not to do corticosterone\ninjections or to get surgery but you\nguessed it to do exactly the same\nexercise izes that the PT in the United\nStates suggested to me now why do I\nraise this well the last thing I want to\ndo is get into a debate online about\nwhether or not one profession like PT or\nCairo or MD Etc is better than the other\nI realize there's a range of talents\nthere are mediocre Terrible Bad\nexcellent and superb practitioners in\nall these categories by the way um\nthat's clear uh to me and hopefully to\neverybody else right you can't look at\nan entire field and say good or entire\nfield and say bad there's going to be a\nrange of quality of practitioners in any\nof those fields but when it comes to\nback pain we are at an interesting point\nin history where depending on where you\nare in the world depending on the\ntraditions of the medical practice in\nthe area in which you live certain forms\nof relieving back pain are going to be\nlooked at as more esoteric than others\nso that's the other reason I offer this\nanecdote this family member of mine and\na couple friends who've experienced back\npain of a similar nature have all now\nIncorporated these um Cobra push-ups uh\nup dog type approaches to some degree of\nsuccess or another it is true that one\nof them had a badly enough herniated\ndisc that they did need surgery so\nsurgery sometimes is needed of course\nbut it's been remarkable to me to see\nhow much I and others can relieve their\nback pain and strengthen the particular\nareas and aspects of the body that then\ncan avoid further back pain and I'm\nquite happy to say that I've had\nessentially zero back pain now that I've\nIncorporated the right rehabilitative\nexercises as well as the right\nstrengthening exercises which include\nThe Big Three that we talked about\nbefore and the ones I'm going to talk\nabout next I realize that when a lot of\npeople hear about back pain they\nimmediately think of sciatica and\nsomebody who's always carried his wallet\nin his back right pocket I'm often told\nhey you're going to get sciatica if you\ncarry your wallet in your back right\npocket um well I always take my wallet\nand put it in my front right pocket when\nI sit down or at least I try to remember\nto so I don't think that's the cause I'm\ncertainly somebody who's had quote\nunquote sciatica now sciatica's most\ncommonly thought of as tingling pain or\nnumbness or some combination of the\nthree in maybe a little bit in the lower\nback in the glute region in the hip and\ndown the leg especially now relieving\nsciatica involves a number of different\napproaches and I'll probably have to do\nan entire episode about sciatica and\nother nerve pathway pain specifically\nbut for the time being a lot of sciatica\nis caused by exactly the sorts of things\nthat we were talking about thus far the\nherniation of the disc the bulging of\nthe disc and the impingement on the\nnerve and when that bulging AKA\nherniation is occurring within the lower\nlumbar region of the spine often times\nit will impinge on a nerve or nerves\nthat innervate the various regions I\njust described so the glutes the hip\ndown the leg and sometimes will activate\npain tingling or numbness in areas which\nare not innervated by that nerve there's\nsomething called referred pain where\nyou're experiencing pain in one part of\nthe body due to an impingement or\ndisruption of a neural pathway or other\npathway or inflammation elsewhere in the\nbody so we're not going to do a deep\ndive on sciatica right now suffice to\nsay that a lot of the symptoms of\nsciatica fall under the umbrella of what\nwe're talking about today which is back\npain and strengthening the back in a way\nthat can help you avoid back pain and\nindeed sciatica as well much of what I\njust spoke about in terms of my own\nexperience with lower back pain could be\nthought of as sciatica because there was\na lot of pain in the hip I almost felt\nas if the hip socket was in pain and\nthere was some um pain not shooting down\nthe leg but kind of in the outer\nuppermost thigh for me some people\nexperience it all the way down to their\ntoes even numbness tingling or pain\nwithin the foot so it really depends on\nthe degree to which those neural\npathways are impinged but the principles\nare the same which are if you are\nexperiencing lower back or related pain\nin the hip the leg the buttocks Etc you\nreally want to figure out is there a\nbulging also called a herniated disc if\nso which direction is the herniation\nlikely occurring is it out toward the\nback of the spine is on one side you\nreally want to understand where that\nherniation and bulging is occurring so\nthat you can do the proper exercises to\nwork that bulging to push essentially\nwhat I'm referring to in analogy as the\npushing back of the cream between the\ntwo Oreo cookies back between those two\nOreo cookies so that you can give some\nrelief from the impingement on those\nnerve roots that are no doubt causing\nthe flare up of back pain or what some\npeople experience and call sciatica okay\nso thus far we've largely been talking\nabout different structural features of\nthe back things like vertebrae which are\nbony the discs Etc that can impinge on\nnerves and cause pain and while pain is\ncertainly neural there are a number of\nthings that exist from literally toe to\nhead that allow our back to move through\nthe various planes of motion in the ways\nit needs to to carry out daily living to\ncarry out Sport and that if we\nstrengthen certain things even very\ndistal very far from the spine we can\nallow for more mobility of the spine\nstrengthening the spine and indeed even\npain relief within the spinal Pathways\nnow the protocols we're about to discuss\nwere shared with me with Dr Shawn\nwheeler sha wheeler is a medical doctor\nwho has an incredible knowledge of back\npain back relief and back\nstrengthening by no means can I\nexhaustively cover all of the knowledge\nthat he shared with the world I'll\nprovide links to some of his work in the\nshow note captions I intend to bring him\nonto the podcast as a guest but the\nHallmark of the protocols I'm about to\nshare with you you is the following we\nhave muscles that are constantly\nactively engaged in order to stabilize\nour spine which again is a good thing\nyou want a stable spine and we have\nmuscles that are not actively engaged\nbut for which we can engage them either\nvoluntarily or we can train them to be\nmore engaged when we're not thinking\nabout it so involuntary engagement but\nwe have an entire set of musculature\nthat is constantly actively engaged in\norder to stabilize our spine\nwhich again is a good thing and we have\nmusculature that can potentially\nstabilize our spine if we focus on it if\nwe consciously decide to so what I'm\nabout to describe are some simple\nprotocols in fact very simple protocols\nthat you can do in order to create more\nspine stability and in fact you can do\nthese anywhere the first involves\nstrengthening the muscles in the front\nof the neck now this is something that I\ndo believe most everybody should be\ndoing anyway why well most people\nnowadays are starting to take on a c\nshape not just rounding the lower spine\nbut the chin is starting to move toward\nthe chest and of course this is because\nmost everybody is texting or on a laptop\nmuch of the time okay this is not an\nexaggeration if you look at people\nwalking around now they are tilted\nforward at the chin they are essentially\ntaking an inch or two off their height\nthey are potentially creating pain\nelsewhere in the body maybe even in the\nneck itself and what I'm about to\ndescribe is a way in which you can very\neasily strengthen the muscles in the\nfront of the neck without adding size to\nthe neck because I know a lot of people\ndon't want to add size to their neck\nI've talked elsewhere about\nstrengthening the muscles on the side of\nthe neck and in the back of the neck\nthis is something that I do believe is\nimportant especially for people that are\ndoing a lot of heavy weightlifting who\nare broadening their shoulders or who\nalready have broad shoulders also just\nfrom a sheer aesthetic perspective\nnothing looks weirder than a little head\nand neck placed on broad shoulders okay\nbut more importantly than any athetic\nmatters is that if the musculature of\nthe neck is weak you have a weak upper\nspine which is not a good thing from the\nperspective of avoiding pain and not a\ngood thing from the perspective of\nsafety let alone posture breathing Etc\nI've talked about that elsewhere I'll\nprovide a link in the show note captions\nto some of the simpler exercises for\nstrengthening the neck that you can do\nwithout equipment in the meantime for\nsake of strengthening and pain proofing\nthe back it's very clear that\nstrengthening the muscles of the front\nof the neck can be very beneficial this\nis something that not just Dr Wheeler\nbut also steuart McGill have been\nproponents of and the simplest way to do\nthis without any equipment is to Simply\nput your fists underneath your not your\nchin but on the two sides of your jaw so\non either side of your chin if you're\njust listening that's where my voice is\ngoing like this and then with your\ntongue on the roof of your mouth and\nbreathing through your nose you're just\ngoing to do a 10-second static\ncontraction where you're going to try\nand move your chin down against the\nresistance of your fists underneath your\njaw okay so you're going to\ngo push down there again tongue on the\nroof of your mouth feel free to exale\nexhale as you do this you might want to\ndo this for three or four repetitions of\n10c static contractions and then just\nrelax you could do that for anywhere\nfrom two to five sets very easy to do\nwhat you're doing is you're generating\nstrength in the muscles of the front of\nthe neck and some nearby musculature it\nhas the tendency to then put you into a\ndefault position at a distance from your\nchest okay so this is different than\nstrengthening the muscles on the back of\nyour neck which will of course help to\nkeep your your chin out and and away\nfrom your chest but when one does this\nthere are a number of different benefits\nimproved Airway passage so as many of\nyou know I'm a big proponent of nasal\nbreathing unless you need to breathe\nthrough your mouth both during sleep and\nsometimes during exercise but certainly\nat rest so strengthening the muscles of\nthe front of the neck again I'll provide\na link to this in the show note caption\nvery easy to do it takes barely any time\nyou can do it anywhere and it has a\nnumber of different benefits for\nstrengthening and pain proofing the\nspine next is to focus on strength of\nyour feet and your toes Yes you heard me\ncorrectly why are we talking about feet\nand toes when we're talking about back\nstrengthening and alleviating back pain\nwell your feet are the foundation of\nyour entire body they're carrying you\naround all day long and it's very clear\nthat the stronger your feet are the\nhealthier the rest of your body is going\nto be it's not to say that the rest of\nyour body will be healthy if you just\nfocus on foot strength that's certainly\nnot the case but strengthening your feet\nhas many many benefits it's something\nthat I've been focusing a lot on in the\nlast couple of years and it's made a\nhuge difference in terms of eliminating\nshin splints when I run it's made a huge\ndifference in terms of alleviating a\ncertain amount of lower back pain\nalthough you heard the anecdote about\nhow I largely did that through other\nmechanisms\nearlier basically strengthening your\nfeet is an allaround terrific thing to\ndo how do you do this well some people\nopt to get very wide toebox shoes some\npeople will even run in those um shoes\nwhere the individual toes are look like\nthey're in a glove I don't own those\nshoes I do have a slightly wider toebox\nshoe for running and I've really\nbenefited from that but basically what\nanyone can do and you don't need to\npurchase any shoes or anything like that\nis to try and see if you can spread your\ntoes out from one another so that none\nof them are touching on both feet many\npeople find that they are able to do\nthat some people including myself found\nthat they could do that on one foot not\nthe other and it just took a couple of\nweeks of working at it and strengthening\nthose neural Pathways learning how to\nactivate those neural pathways through\nconcentration to be able to spread my\ntoes on both feet this might sound a\nlittle silly to some of you but being\nable to spread your toes on both feet\nactually says a lot about your ability\nto activate distal neural Pathways or I\nshould say neural Pathways to distal\nparts of your body there's a bunch of\ninteresting data about how that\ncorrelates with some metrics of Aging or\nlack of Aging I'm going to cover that in\na future podcast but some people find\nthat they can't spread their toes out\nand they need a little bit of help from\ntoe spreaders yes there are commercially\navailable toe spreaders that take the\nform of these kind of um stocks that you\ncan put between um your toes these are\nrubber stocks that then spread the toes\nit can be a little bit uncomfortable at\nfirst but then you get better at it help\nyou learn to spread your toes you\ncertainly don't need those things you\ncould even just take some you know paper\ntowel or or tissue paper or something of\nthat that's that's firm and put it\nbetween your toes and that will help you\nlearn to spread your toes I'm not\nsuggesting you walk walk around all day\nwith tow spreaders although some people\nactually do that but basically what\nyou're doing is you're creating the\nability to activate the neural Pathways\nthat that allow you excuse me to spread\nyour toes I know this might sound silly\nbut if you do this you're going to find\nthat you're walking your stance when\nyou're stationary and certainly if you\ndo any kind of running or cycling you're\ngoing to find that all of those things\nare going to benefit in addition there\nis benefit to strengthening your toes\nthis is something that I'm only now\nstarting to explore um one way you can\ndo this is by sitting in a chair\nBarefoot spreading your toes as much as\npossible and then seeing whether or not\nyou can lift each toe independently I'm\nnot at the point where I can do that yet\nI'm still trying to learn how to um lift\nmy big toes independent of my other toes\nagain all this is learning how to\nactivate neural Pathways to distal parts\nof your body that serve as stabilizers\nfor the arch of the foot for the foot\nitself for the ankle for the shin that\ncarry over to spine stability and a\nstrong spine I know it seem seems kind\nof wild that we're talking about the\nfeet and Toes spreading to benefit your\nback but all of these things relate to\none another up and down the chain of\nactivation involved in Walking In\nrunning and certainly if you're involved\nin any other sports but also just\nstanding around so don't underestimate\nthe power of learning to spread your\ntoes and learning to move your toes\nindependently and then of course there's\na whole set of exercises that you can\nfind online of how to actually\nstrengthen the individual toes with\nbands and things of that sort pretty\nadvanced stuff most people aren't going\nto do that but if you're willing to\nexplore that stuff it's clear that there\nare a lot of benefits and again there's\nsome exciting literature starting to\nemerge about the benefits of toe\nstrengthening and toe spreading and all\nthat stuff as it relates to believe it\nor not neurocognitive longevity I know\nit sounds wild but this is actually a\nliterature that's starting to pick up\nsome weight so it's one that I'm paying\nattention to and that uh I'm certainly\ngoing to cover in a future podcast Okay\nso we've got strengthening the neck\nwe've got toes spreading at a minimum\nmaking sure that you can spread all your\ntoes move them independently that would\nbe great what's that going to do that\nmeans that when you're standing at rest\nthat you're creating a stable base for\nyourself when you're walking when you're\nrunning and certainly when you're\nlifting or you're playing any sports\nyou're creating the most stable base for\nyourself possible when I say stable base\nI don't just mean because the toes are\nspread I mean because if you can\nactivate the musculature to spread those\nToes or if they're passively in that\nspread toe position not touching one\nanother you're going to be activating\nsome of the musculature that's I guess\nfor the typical person we think of this\nas in the arch of the foot and the top\nof the foot and running up to the front\nof the shin that's going to create the\nmost stability for your lower limbs your\nupper limbs your pelvis and your spine\nokay now in discussions with Dr Wheeler\nand discussions with Dr starett and\ndiscussions with Dr Stu McGill all of\nthem really emphasize that when doing\nresistance\ntraining that bracing the body by\nessentially not doing a big belly breath\nbut filling the body with air so that\nyou essentially create a firmness within\nthe abdominal walls and the spinal\nErectors and the obliques so this would\nbe essential in a squat type movement or\nother types of movements that's\nbeneficial during resistance exercise to\ncreate the most stable canister of you\nthe most stable activation of the\nmusculature around the spine to avoid\ninjury and also to lift the greatest\namount of weight there's a number of\ndifferent mechanical advantages and\nsafety advantages that are afforded when\nwe do that this was also something that\nI discussed with Dr Andy Galpin when he\ndid his series on exercise physiology\nwith us\nagain we find a link to that in the show\nnote captions now that bracing that\nfilling of the body with air and that\nbracing of the abdominals and the\nmusculature essentially that runs like a\nbelt around the midsection to make\nyourself strong and stable during those\nmovements that's all fine and good but\nit turns out that when we're at rest\nwhen we're just standing around we\nactually want to do the opposite we\nactually want to relax that musculature\nand belly breathe now I've done an\nentire episode about breathing and the\ndifference between belly breathing\nversus breathing where the chest lifts\nor a combination of both but we can keep\nthis very simple you can do yourself a\ngreat favor by trying to remember that\nwhen you're at rest you're just standing\naround maybe you're seated or standing\nand working or you're talking or\nsomething of that sort that you're\nideally nasal breathing unless you're\nspeaking or eating or something of that\nsort and you are belly breathing okay so\nyou're actually relaxing the abdominals\nas you inhale and the belly is moving\nout and then as you exhale the belly\nmoves in so that's the ideal pattern\nwhen it rests the exact opposite of the\npattern that you want when you're\nactively engaging all that musculature\nfor sake of exercise and stability\nespecially when you're engaging in\nweight training under loads so that\nplaces us at strength in the front of\nthe neck toes spreading and\nstrengthening of the feet belly\nbreathing at rest and then there's a\nkind of fun one that's something that\nI've been incorporating a lot because\nfrankly I'm not a big fan of doing\nabdominal work it's just not something\nthat I really enjoy doing in the gym or\nelsewhere but I know that it's important\nto have a strong abdominal wall it's\nimportant to have strong abdominals\ngenerally and yes occasionally I'll grab\nonto a bar and I'll do a set of Pikes I\nactually enjoy Pikes you know bring my\nankles up to my hands and doing that\ntrying to stop there doing LS sits\nthings like that I'll do those every\nonce in a while but what I found to be\nvery beneficial and that is more kind of\nrealworld related in the sense that it\nactivates the musculature of the\nabdominals you can train your abdominals\nwhile doing things that more closely\nmimic what you do in real life is to\nactually stagger one's stance while\ndoing certain forms of resistance\ntraining okay so not during deadlifts\nnot during squats or anything of that\nsort but let's say during dumbbell curls\nfor the biceps rather than stand with\nfeet parallel standing with one foot in\nfront of the other making sure that they\nare wide enough apart in the lateral\nplane as we'll call it okay so far\nenough away on either side of your belly\nbutton so that you're stable Little Bend\nin the knees and then making sure that\nyour belly button is still facing Direct\ndirectly forward this is really key not\ntwisting the Torso but making sure that\nyour belly button is facing directly\nforward and doing curls one arm then the\nother arm one arm then the other arm\nthen switching to a stance in which the\nother foot goes forward and the other\nfoot goes back again make sure that\nyou're not in a CrossCountry skier\nposition with the feet very close to\nyour midline because if they are you're\nnot going to be stable so make sure that\nthey're far enough away from your belly\nbutton on either side that there's a\nbend in your knees so that you're stable\nand then doing curls that way can also\ndo this for any kind of triceps exercise\nlike an overhead triceps extension those\nare mainly the exercises in which one\ncould apply this although there are a\nfew others maybe for back work maybe for\nshoulder work although I think parallel\nstance is probably best for that and\ncertainly for leg work so what are you\ndoing if you do curls or overhead\ntriceps extension in this way with one\nfoot forward then the other foot forward\nwhat are you doing well if you\ndeliberately insist meaning force\nyourself to keep your belly button\nfacing exactly forward and for that\nreason sometimes it's helpful to do\nthese in front of a mirror what you're\ndoing is you're generating\nanti-rotational forces you're requiring\nthat your upper body not twist while\nyou're lifting these loads and what that\ndoes is it trains the obliques it trains\ncomponents of your abdominals and to\nsome extent it's training components of\nyour lower back although not so much as\nit is the obliques the abdominals that\nare anti-rotation that are preventing\nyour body from twisting while you're\ncarrying out these movements and in\ndoing so you're also mimicking the way\nthat a lot of movements are carried out\nin daily life because if you think about\nit it's pretty uncommon that you're\ngoing to be lifting things with one arm\nwith feet parallel I mean it happens\nokay there are times when feet are\nparallel and we're lifting something up\nwith both hands there are times in which\nyou do something similar to kind of the\nstance that you would be in for a\ndumbbell curl you know with feet\nparallel in the gym or a tricep\nextensions with feet parallel but more\noften than not as we move through life\none or the other feet is positioned in\nfront of the other and you know we're\nreaching something or lifting something\nor we're pulling something those are the\npatterns that exist more typically in\ndaily life and those are the patterns of\nmovement that typically people hurt\nthemselves while doing you know they\nreach down to get something out of a\ncabinet they'll reach into the back and\nthey'll twist a bit to grab something in\nthe back and that's when their back will\ngo or they're reaching overhead to grab\nsomething and they're twisting as they\nreach with one arm so I've certainly\nfound and this was supported by again\nall of the experts that I spoke to that\nstaggering one stance while performing\nresistance training typically curls or\noverhead tricep extensions there aren't\nmany other things that lend themselves\nwell to this so those are the two that\nI'm really focusing on doing that while\ninsisting that is forcing yourself to\nkeep your belly buttons facing\ncompletely forward okay not tilting to\nthe side either way that can really help\nstrengthen the abdominals through the\nuse of what's called anti-rotation this\nis also what you're going to experience\nif you ever take a yoga class and you do\na pose where you know it's arms overhead\nLike a Warrior 2 pose or a warrior one\npose and they'll say make sure that your\nbelly button is facing completely\nforward that you're not twisting to the\nside too much this is also what the\ninstructor will tell you in a Pilates or\na yoga class very often in certain\nmovements where there's a tendency to\nkind of um relax or sag into a twisted\nupper torso of course there's some yoga\nand pilates movements that require that\nyou twist your upper torso but that's\nnot what we're talking about here this\nis when they tell you keep your belly\nbutton facing forward you're generating\nanti-rotation forces not just of the\nabdominals but as the abdominals connect\nto the pelvis and of course all of that\nis providing stability for the spine and\nthen if you run down the legs in your\nmind that is and you think about your\nfeet with those nice spread toes and the\nactivated um musculature on the base and\nthe top of your feet and running up the\nfront of your shin and your calves you\ncan really imagine how you're creating\nthe most stable positioning on the floor\nstable positioning of the spine no\nwonder that the spine is not only going\nto experience less shearing stress less\npain but you're also in a position\nposition to create a nice strong chain\nof activation from the nerves and\nmuscles from the base of the floor all\nthe way up to your neck because you're\nalready strengthening your neck okay so\nin terms of protocols thus far we've\ncovered stum Mill's big three then we\ntalked a little bit about things you can\ndo to relieve pain so this was the\nhanging from a bar with the toes\ntouching the ground right as well as the\nkind of up doog or Cobra exercises and\nthen we talked about five or six things\nthat one can do including strengthening\nthe neck spreading the toes\nstrengthening the feet Etc in order to\ngenerate strength and stability distal\nto the back and thereby to strengthen\nand pain prooof the back now we're going\nto cover four final protocols to\nstrengthen your back pain prooof your\nback and allow you the greatest degree\nof Mobility both for sake of Mobility\nduring exercise and in daily living the\nfirst of those four protocols is going\nto be to activate and strengthen and in\nsome cases Des spasm the medial glute\nwhich is a muscle that most people don't\nthink about the medial glute is involved\nin stabilizing the hips as you walk as\nyou run okay so it's going to prevent\nthe pelvis from moving from side to side\nit's one that when it weakens or when\nyou have trouble activating it can lead\nto some forms of what is perceived as\nlower back pain so if you reach to your\nlower back and you feel these kind of\nlike two kind of like almost like\nnodules at the top of your pelvis a lot\nof people will experience pain in and\naround that region or maybe even as a\nkind of a like a belt um of pain around\nthat area more or less and in some not\nall cases but in some cases that's due\nto lack of medial glute activation or in\nsome cases it's due to spasming of\nmusculature in that region it's really\nhard to tell unless you're being\nassessed by an expert which one it is\nagain that's not what we're here to do\nwhat I am here to do is to provide you a\nprotocol that I've found to be\ntremendously beneficial for relieving\nthe sort of lower low back pain and the\nkind of pain that even extends into the\ntop of the glutes that many people\nexperience especially if you've been\nsitting a lot if you've been driving a\nlot flying a lot if you find yourself\ndoing a lot of hip hinging exercise like\nsquats and then you travel so you're\nsitting on a plane for a while and you\ndon't um pay mind to really stay in a\nyou know flatb or um arched back\nposition by the way if you're somebody\nwho has disc bulging in that direction\nthat we talked about before and can\nbenefit from doing those Cobra poses or\nkind of up dog you know push-ups if you\ntravel or drive or you're seated a lot\nfor work I and many others find it\nreally beneficial just take a towel and\njust roll it up and put it so you\nmaintain the arch in your lower back so\nyou're not rounding in your seat that\ncan be really useful and it makes\nperfect sense if you think about it\ngiven what we were talking about before\nwith the squeezing out of the cream of\nthe Oreo cookie in that direction you\nwant to make sure that you're not\nrounding your lower back too much\nkeeping it straight or a little bit\narched is going to be beneficial not\noverly arched but straight or a little\nbit arched and a you know a\nrolled up towel or something of that\nsort that you can put in your lower back\ncan really be helpful for that now the\nprotocol here is to essentially activate\nand Des spasm the medial glute this is\nactually a protocol that I learned from\nJeff Cavalier long before I ever met him\nor he was on the podcast which he's been\non the podcast Jeff cavaliere has a\nYouTube channel called athleen X which\nhas tons of zeroc cost protocols for\nresistance training for cardiovascular\ntraining he just provides so much useful\ninformation again zero cost I've\nactually paid for his programs no he\ndidn't ask me to say that he doesn't pay\nme to say that over the years I've paid\nto use various programs from athlex and\nthey've benefited me tremendously I've\ncustomized them a bit for myself but in\nany case love the work he does grateful\nto call him a friend extremely grateful\nthat he was a guest on this podcast\nwe'll Pro provide a link to the episode\nthat he did talking about exercise and\nexercise physiology and nutrition in the\nshow note captions in any event the\nprotocol here is to activate and some\ncases Des spasm the medial glutes which\ncan be done in a very straightforward\nway where you lie on your side\nessentially like you were going to do a\nside plank so you've got your elbow and\nyour forearm on the ground making that\nfist you would imagine you'd go into a\nside plank except no you're going to\nkeep the lower leg the leg that's in\ncontact with the floor against the floor\nyou're going to take the leg that's on\ntop you're going to point the toe down\nokay so you're not bridging up into a\nside plank you're just resting on the\nfloor on your side you take that top leg\npoint the toe down you bring that toe\nout in front of you touch it to the\nfloor and then you're going to bring\nyour heel back you're going to extend it\nnot overextend it but extend it as far\nas you can with your heel pointed toward\nthe back wall and up towards the ceiling\nso you're trying to maintain that\ndownward pointed toe effort okay then\nyou're going to lower it again touch\nbring it all the way back up you're\ngoing to do that for maybe five 10\nrepetitions and then on the final\nrepetition you're going to hold it there\nin that raised position not as long as\nyou can but probably anywhere from 10 to\n20 seconds depending on how much\nstrength you have in your medial glutes\nto be able to do that and if you like\nyou can also take your hand on the side\nof the foot that you're raising okay so\nif you're lying on your left side you're\ngoing to take your your right hand and\nyou're going to take your thumb and put\nit right at the top of your glutes and\nyou'll feel when the leg is fully\nextended back with the heel towards the\nback wall and ceiling you'll feel the\nmuscle activate there and you can kind\nof push against it what are you doing\nwhen you do this you're activating the\nmedial glute you're in some cases Des\nspasming the medial glute and some of\nthe musculature around there and many\npeople find that they get considerable\npain relief of that low low back region\nwhen they do this exercise you of course\nwould want to switch to the other side\neven if you're not experiencing pain on\nthe other side and do the same thing for\nthe opposite side so lying on your right\nright hand side taking then your left\nleg pointing the toe down putting in\nfront of you bringing it back doing\nmultiple repetitions of that and then\nholding it in a static hold while\nfeeling that medial glute get activated\nand then taking some rest this is the\nsort of thing that you can do if you're\nexperiencing low low back pain to see if\nit provides some relief many people find\nit does provide that relief if of course\nit exacerbates your pain please stop\ndoing it you never want to exacerbate\npain in any kind of way but many people\nfind that it relieves the pain in that\nlow low back region and it does so not\njust during the exercise but in the\nminutes and hours following you may need\nto repeat this a couple times per day\nyou may need to adjust your other\nactivities including exercise it really\ndepends on the severity of your back\npain and injury the nature of it Etc\nhowever it's something that many people\nincluding I also include in our regular\nroutines I'll sometimes do this as part\nof a warm up on leg day I'll sometimes\ndo this just while you know watching TV\nor something which I don't do terribly\noften but I'll just take a couple of\nminutes literally just 2 minutes or 3\nminutes and I'll do a couple sets of\nthese on either side just to maintain\nthat neuromuscular activation of the\nmedial glute some people I would say\nmost people are not very good at\nactivating that medial glute region if\nyou're somebody who is being\nconscientious and doing a lot of\nposterior chain work such as Kabal\nswings on a regular basis you're doing\nglute ham raises which I'm a huge fan of\nI'll do an entire video about posterior\nchain and why I'm such a big fan of glut\nham raises unfortunately you need a\nspecialized piece of equipment to do\nthem or Nordic curls such a big fan of\nNordic curls glut ham raises etc for all\nsorts of reasons strengthening the back\nstrengthening the posterior chain making\nsure you can still generate power in the\npelvic region lower back region while\nmaintaining posture especially as you\nage all of that I'll talk more about\nthose in a future episode of The hubman\nLab podcast but the point is this many\npeople just fail to get activation of\nthe glutes in a way that supports their\nlower back and allows them to strengthen\ntheir back to the extent that they would\notherwise and much of the time it's not\njust a failure to activate the glutes\nbecause of course there are many ways to\nactivate the glutes there are all sorts\nof exercises you can read about online\nbut a failure to activate the medial\nglute muscles in particular that people\nneed to overcome by strengthening those\nnerve to muscle Pathways and of course\nI'm talking about activation of the\nmedial glutes and Des spasming of the\nmedial glute which is really what\nhappens when you hold that medial glute\ncontraction for some period of time then\nafterwards you allow some relaxation in\nthose neural pathways that is often\nagain not always but often the cause of\nthat low low back pain so if you have\nlow low back pain and it's safe for you\nto perform this exercise I encourage you\nto give it a try again it requires no\nequipment it's very easy takes almost no\ntime and at least for me and many others\nthat I've spoken to it has been\ntremendously helpful in relieving that\nlower back pain by Des spasming the\nmedial glute and at the same time\nallowing for nerve to muscle activation\nof the medial glut such that the medial\nglutes can be active when they need to\nin order to stabilize the pelvis and\nallow for the strongest possible pelvic\nspine interface okay so the next\nprotocol is one that you can do\nessentially anywhere it takes almost no\ntime and it's a wonderful one because it\nallows for stretching of the soaz muscle\nright the muscle that is easy to say and\nhard to spell soaz it's PSAs right I\nthink the p is generally silent you'd\nsay soaz muscle um the soaz muscle is\ninvolved in connecting the spine to the\npelvis okay it also has an interaction\nwith the diaphragm that's really\nimportant this muscle that's important\nfor breathing and many people have\ntightening of the soaz tightening of the\nhip flexors but being able to stretch\nthe soaz muscle is something that\nprovides a ton of relief to the\ntightness that one can experience from\nsitting too much from being in a hip\nhinge position too much especially if\nyou're doing heavy hip hinge work and\nthen you're sitting or driving a lot and\nmany people also just carry a lot of\nstress in their midsection and relieving\nor stretching the soas can be very\nbeneficial okay there's a lot about this\nthat could be said in fact I'll probably\ndo an entire episode about soas and\nfascia okay I know there's a lot of\nrequests to talk about fascia but it's\nfar too much to get into now here's the\nprotocol that I do believe everyone can\nbenefit from I don't care how bendy you\nare how rigid you are how big you are\nhow live you are how slim you are this\nis a wonderful exercise it just feel so\ngood and it allows you to afterwards be\nin a long spine posture to really feel\nopened up at the hips if you will now\nI'm using yoga type language but I think\nyou understand what I mean and it is a\ngreat stress reliever as well which is\nessentially to do what looks like a\nWarrior 2 position in yoga so you're\nessentially doing a lunge okay where\nyou're going to Lunge with one leg back\nand the other leg forward of course\nthat's a lunge and then you're going to\ntake the hand on the same side as the\nleg that's extended behind you reach\nthat toward the ceiling okay and then\nyou're going to\nrotate\npinky clockwise okay the other way to\nthink about this is to put the palm of\nyour hand parallel to the ceiling if\nyou're doing it outside parallel to the\nsky okay so you're going to get into the\nlongest lunge that you safely can for\nyou okay that's going to differ for\neverybody and then you're going to raise\nthe arm on the same side as the leg\nthat's extended backward and you're\ngoing to go parallel Palm to the sky or\nto the\nceiling this will provide a stretch all\nthe way or you should feel a stretch all\nthe way from your wrist down past your\nhip and possibly even into the foot\nthat's behind you now Dr Stuart McGill\nshowed me this um I've certainly done\nWarrior 2 pose in yoga classes and when\nI've done yoga at home from time to time\nI wasn't new to raising an arm overhead\nwhile stretching in a lunge position but\nDr Su Mill was the one who really\nemphasized that by putting the Palm\nparallel to the sky to the ceiling and\ntwisting a bit so that you're turning\nthat pinky toward I would say the best\nway to describe this is to turn that\npinky toward your head okay not away\nfrom your head but toward your head\nwhile still maintaining a flat palm and\nreaching as much as you can and\nextending all the way from the heel of\nthat back foot all the way up to your\npalm that you're getting stretching not\njust of the soas but they also getting\nactivation of some of the\nneurofascial aspects going from Palm all\nthe way to heel that provide some relief\nthat is some relaxation of the\nmusculature that otherwise is providing\ntension of the spine pelvic interface\nand that can allow for better posture\nlonger spine and at the same time strong\nspine positioning after you do the\nexercise and of course you want to do\nthis on both sides now I realize that\nmany of you are just listening to this\nyou're not watching this but even for\nthose of you that are watching on\nYouTube it's very difficult since I'm\nseated behind a desk to show you the\nproper form of this exercise which is\nwhy we've provided a link to a visual of\nthis exercise in the show note captions\nthat you can go look at otherwise but\nhopefully it's clear to you it's\nbasically a lunge front leg slightly\nbent at the knee back leg perhaps\nslightly bent but extended behind you so\nyou're in a lunge position arm on the\nsame side as the extended leg raised\noverhead pum Palm parallel to the\nceiling okay with arm extended and\nturning your wrist a bit so that your\npinky is more or less trying to point\ntowards your head although most people\nincluding myself probably don't have the\nflexibility to do that all the way so\nthat your pinky is pointed towards your\nhead I encourage you to experiment with\nthis a little bit until you feel that\nstretch all the way from hand down to\nheel it feels really good to do you can\nhold it for anywhere from 5 to 10\nseconds you can exhale or inhale doesn't\nreally matter you can just breathe\nnormally the point here is that you're\ngetting a terrific stretch of the soaz\nyou then switch to the other side get a\nterrific stretch of the other side soas\nand after you move out of this pose you\nwill definitely feel as if you sort of\nhave quote unquote lengthen the spine\nyou know the extent to which you have\nlengthen the spine isn't clear what more\nlikely has happened is that you have\nsome relaxation and perhaps even some\nlengthening between the spine and pelvic\nconnection so then you can sit upright\nnice straight spine and you're not being\npulled forward by that tighten soas that\nconnects the spine to the pelvis okay so\nthat's sort of the simplest way that I\ncan describe all that it's a wonderful\nexercise to do you can do it in an\nairport you can do it when you get home\nyou can do it when you get out of the\ncar it's one of those things that\nprovides a ton of relief in terms of\nkind of stress and compression and C\nshaping of the spine from sitting that\nmost all of us are doing too much of\nthese days and as Dr Stu Mill will\nexplain when he comes on the podcast it\nalso provides some both activation and\nrelaxation\nof the nerve to fascial to muscle\ninterface that's so critical for having\na strong and pain-free spine okay so the\nfinal protocol I want to share with you\ntoday believe it or not is purely mental\nit's purely cognitive it doesn't involve\nany movement what it does involve is\ndeveloping an awareness of your movement\npatterns As you move through your daily\nlife including exercise but not limited\nto exercise what do I mean by this well\nbased on what I told you at the\nbeginning of today's episode and\nthroughout today's episode you are now\narmed with knowledge about the different\ncomponents of back Anatomy the vertebrae\nthe discs the nerves the muscles and how\nthose relate to one another and how\nbulging that is herniating of the discs\nor I would hope not but even rupturing\nthe of the discs or inflammation at a\nparticular spinal segment or maybe tonic\nstatic contraction at the level of the\nneck or lack of strengthen the feet how\nthat could create back pain how that\ncould limit back Mobility how that could\nlimit overall Mobility so the final\nprotocol of today's episode is for you\nto really pay attention to any pain you\nmight happen to have in your back region\nand any kind of limitation you have in\nterms of its ability to manage loads or\nto generate the kinds of movement that\nyou need for your life what do I mean by\nthis well if you're somebody who has a\nlot of lower back stiffness lower back\npain you might ask yourself okay when I\ndrive when I sit even if I use a\nstanding desk what is the position of my\nfeet are they directly underneath my\npelvis am I rounding my back if you're\nsomebody who has a lot of pain in your\nlow to midback and you find just by way\nof observation that you're rounding your\nback a lot of the time either because\nyou're texting or typing maybe you need\nto take a towel roll it up and put it in\nyour lower back region maybe you need to\njust spend a little bit more time each\nday not all day but a little bit of time\nbeing consciously aware of maintaining a\nlittle bit of lower back arch or maybe\neven a straight back if you can't arch\nyour back in that way if you're somebody\nwho's standing at your standing desk or\neven just talking to friends or family\nmembers do you always lean to one side\ndo you always relax to one hip is that\nbecause you're not activating the medial\nglute on one side more than the other or\neither or is it because you know you\ntend to stand with one foot in front of\nthe other or you're not maintaining\nenough toes spread or you don't have the\nstrength in your feet to kind of\nstabilize yourself are you relaxed with\nyour breathing and letting your belly go\nout when you're not exercising these are\nthe sorts of things that once you start\nto observe and by the way you don't have\nto become neurotically self- observant\nall the time about your back and your\nbreathing in your foot position that's\nnot what we want okay that is absolutely\nnot the goal here but if you're\nexperiencing back tightness or shoulder\ntightness you should ask yourself are\nyou you know constantly like thumbs\npointed in shoulders rolled forward are\nyou doing enough pulling exercises to\nbalance out all the pushing exercises\nyou might be doing like push-ups and\nshoulder presses and bench presses make\nsure you're balancing the back\nmusculature and the shoulder and chest\nmusculature these kinds of things are\nextremely valuable to pay attention to\nbecause oftentimes the origin of your\nback pain or the origin of your sciatica\nor the origin of your neck pain and\ntension is something that can be fairly\nsimply remedied it doesn't necessarily\nmean you have an injury maybe you have a\nsmall degree of dis bulging and if so\nwhat direction is that bulging is it\ntoward the front of your spine the side\nis it the back and if so what are you\ngoing to do to adjust it are you going\nto do you know one or two sets of those\nCobra push-ups each day are you going to\nput that you know towel rolled up behind\nyour back in order to make sure that\nthat bulge doesn't increase further are\nyou going to avoid doing a lot of\ncrunching in the gym many of you are\ngoing to need to avoid doing crunching\nand finding other ab exercises like the\nrollup to do in order to still\nstrengthen your abdominals which is so\nimportant for stabilizing the spine and\nhaving a strong pain-free back but you\ndon't want to generate more forward\nrolling and bulging of the discs out the\nback of the spine for all the reasons\nthat are now obvious to you so this\nfinal protocol is one that I could go on\nfor hours about but really it's for you\nto think about for just a couple of\nminutes for a couple of days and just\npay attention to your movement patterns\nhow you stand at rest how you breathe at\nrest whether or not you're using best\npossible posture or whether or not\nyou're using postures and patterns of\noveruse in your daily life and in sport\nthese things can really build up some\nstrong imbalances in neuromuscular\nactivation patterns that over time can\ntranslate into pain and even if they\ndon't translate into pain can translate\ninto a weakened back system or put more\nappropriately a weakened body system\nwhere you know you're always sagging one\nshoulder or you're not breathing\nproperly because your chin is always\ntowards your chest these kinds of things\nnow today's episode is certainly not\ngeared towards fixing every aspect of\nyour posture your movement patterns\nstrengthening your back and removing\nyour back pain however I will say that\nthanks to the information that's out\nthere from the peer-reviewed literature\nand from these fabulous practitioners\nagain MDS pts folks even in the\nChiropractic Community I say even\nbecause oftentimes they take a lot of\nheat from people in the other\ncommunities but again there's a range of\nquality of practitioners in all these\ndifferent domains they've really started\nto explore these different aspects of\nback strengthening and removing pain\nfrom the back in ways that sure they\ncome to the table through different\nlenses of training right some are going\nto talk about laser therapy and by the\nway we didn't cover that on purpose\nthere's a little bit of evidence but\nit's not super strong for laser therapy\nfor the back okay there I just upset all\nthe people are into laser therapy we'll\nget into that in a future episode sure\nthere's evidence that Pilates that yoga\nwalking has been shown to be\ntremendously beneficial for back pain\nthere's wonderful evidence for any and\nall of those different practices what\nI've tried to focus on today were prot\nprotols that practitioners who spent\nmost if not all of their careers\nthinking about strengthening the back\nand pain proofing the back generally\nagree on okay I realize there isn't\ngoing to be Universal consensus but they\ngenerally agree that Stu Mill's big\nthree the curup the side plank the bird\ndog they generally agree that\nstrengthening the stabilization muscles\nand Pathways from feet up to hips and\nall the way to shoulders and top of the\nhead including the neck including\nbreathing in a particular way while\nrelaxed while not exercising again those\nwould be belly breaths ideally through\nthe nose unless you're talking or you're\neating making sure that your abdominals\nare strong not just from crunching but\nthat you're activating the obliques that\nthe muscles between your ribs are strong\nsomething that can really benefit from\nanti-rotation work so that you can\ngenerate a stiff stable spine which is\ngreat provided you can do that when you\nwant to voluntarily and then you can\nrelax and you can move about your days\nstill in great posture is still in a\nstrong position but without having to\nbrace all the time which is obviously\nsomething you don't want to have to do\nas you move through your life and having\na number of different stretches that\nallow for lengthening of the spine we\ntalked earlier about hanging from a bar\nwith feet touching the ground so that\nyou can create some space to alleviate\nhopefully some of the disc bulge to\nnerve impingement that might be causing\npain that you might want to do those\nCobra type push-ups or those up dog type\nmovements that can provide some kind of\npushing back of the cream between the\ntwo Oreo cookies that I use as an an\nanalogy for the discs and the spinal\nsegments these are the sorts of things\nthat most all of the data and most all\nof the experts in the field generally\nagree on and so I've offered them to you\ntoday in the form of this list of\nprotocols there are about a dozen of\nthem I realize again we have links to\nexamples of them in video form in the\nshow note captions I certainly don't\nexpect that everybody's going to do all\nof these every day that's by no means\nthe expectation think of these more or\nless as a buffet of things that you\ncould explore and experiment with\ndepending on whether or not you have\nback pain in which case please proceed\ntowards them with a lot of caution\nplease remember also that I am not\nsaying that epidurals painkillers\nsurgery and other methods for treating\nback pain are not useful I am certainly\nnot saying that those certainly have\ntheir place and yet I would say many\npeople if not many or even all adults\ncould certainly benefit from thinking\nabout\nhow their back interfaces with their\npelvis their legs their feet their neck\nand vice versa and thinking about how to\nstrengthen that entire system by\ncreating a strong core a strong lower\nback generating the proper movement\npatterns and doing so through protocols\nlike the ones I described today that\ndon't take a lot of time require zero\nequipment they're essentially zero cost\nexcept for the minimal time investment\nrequired and that have been shown time\nand time again to lead to a stronger\npain-free back if you're learning from\nAndor enjoying this podcast please\nsubscribe to our YouTube channel that's\na terrific zeroc cost way to support us\nin addition please
