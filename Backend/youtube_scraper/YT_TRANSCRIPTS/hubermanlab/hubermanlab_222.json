    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\nI'm Andrew Huberman,\nand I'm a professor of\nneurobiology and ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate from my teaching\nand research roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is ROKA.\nROKA makes sunglasses and eyeglasses.\nAnd I'm delighted that they're a partner\nand a sponsor for the podcast.\nAs some of you may already\nknow I've spent two decades\nor more studying the visual system,\nhow we see?\nVision is absolutely\nthe most important sense\nby which humans navigate\nthe world and survive.\nAnd our eyes as two pieces of our brain\ndo many other important things as well.\nSo taking good care of\nour eyesight is essential.\nFounded by two All-Americans\nswimmers from Stanford.\nROKA was born out of an\nobsession for performance.\nThey've carefully put science and purpose\nbehind their design choices\nand they built absolutely\nterrific products as a result.\nThe glasses are amazing.\nI love them because they look great.\nThey are super comfortable\nand the optical clarity is incredible.\nThey filter out sunlight in a way\nthat still allows you to\nsee contrast and shadows\nthe way you need to.\nAnd for me, one of the things\nthat's really irritating\nis if I have a pair of sunglasses\nthat don't allow me to see\nall the things I want to see.\nAnd with ROKA glasses,\nI get incredible contrast\nbut then I can also relax\nand be outdoors in bright light.\nAnd as the amount of light\nchanges with cloud cover\nand things of that sort,\nmy ability to see my surroundings\ncoz it's still really\nsharp and really clear.\nAnd that only comes from\nreally understanding\nhow the visual system works,\nand how it adjusts to\ncontrast and adaptation\nand all these different things.\nThey really understand the science\nand that went into the\ndesign of these glasses.\nAnd as many of you know,\nsunlight and the viewing of light\nis also very important for\nsetting circadian rhythm.\nSo that's also been incorporated\ninto the design and science\nbehind these glasses.\nI do wear readers.\nI don't often wear them\nduring the podcast,\nbut I have to wear\nreading glasses at night.\nSo I use their readers and I\nown a pair of their sunglasses.\nAnd I'm delighted with them.\nIf you'd like to check out ROKA glasses,\nyou can go to www.roka.com,\nthat's R-O-K-A.com and\nenter the code Huberman\nto save 20% off your first order.\nThat's R-O-K-A.com,\nenter the code Huberman\nat checkout to get 20% off\nyour first order.\nToday's podcast is also brought\nto you by InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI'm a big believer in getting\nregular blood work done\nfor the simple reason that\nmany of the important things\nthat are vital to our\nimmediate and long-term health\ncan only be detected in a\ngood quality blood test.\nThe problem with blood tests\nis that most blood tests\nyou get a lot of information\nback about that are too high\nor too low of this thing\nor the other thing.\nBut making sense of that,\nand what to do with that\ninformation is very challenging.\nEven if you have a really\nattentive physician,\noftentimes it's mysterious\nas to what to do with all this data.\nWith InsideTracker, they make\nit very easy to understand\nwhat all the metabolic factors,\nhormone factors, et cetera,\nmean for you and what to\ndo about those markers.\nSo they offer you directives\nin terms of nutrition,\nsupplementation, as well\nas lifestyle factors\nlike exercise, sleep, et cetera,\nthat can allow you to take\ncontrol of those numbers\nand bring them into the\nranges that are best for you\nand your long-term health.\nAnother feature of InsideTracker\nthat's great is their inner age test.\nThis test shows you\nwhat your biological age\nand how it compares to\nyour chronological age,\nwhich I can only imagine\nmost everybody including me\nare extremely interested in\nhow long am I likely to live?\nHow old am I really in\nterms of my biology?\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can visit\nwww.insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get

drink.\nI've been using Athletic\nGreens since 2012,\nand so I'm delighted that\nthey're sponsoring the podcast.\nWith athletic greens,\nyou get a ton of factors\nthat are good for you\nmixed into this one\nreally good tasting drink.\nI like to mix mine with water\nand a little bit of lemon juice,\nand I drink that once or twice a day.\nTypically, once early in the day,\nand sometimes also in the\nafternoon or even evening.\nI'm able to sleep after drinking\nin the evening just fine.\nThe reason I been using\nAthletic Greens for so long\nthat I continue to use\nAthletic Greens is that,\none, I feel better when I take it.\nI just do.\nPsychologically,\nphysically, I feel better.\nBut also it covers all\nmy bases of the things\nthat I need for my general health.\nIt's sort of a foundational\nsupplement as I like to call it.\nIn fact, when people ask me,\nwhat should I take?\nIf I were to recommend just one supplement\nthat people take it\nwould be Athletic Greens.\nWith Athletic Greens, you\nget support for your gut\nwhich is important,\nbecause the gut microbiome is important\nfor the gut brain access,\nfor mood, metabolism,\nhormones, et cetera.\nThere are so many data that\nsupport that statement.\nAs well, there are many\nfactors in Athletic Greens\nthat support general health metabolism,\nendocrine factors, immunity, et cetera.\nSo with Athletic Greens, I\ndrink it once or twice a day.\nAnd I know that I've got all that covered.\nIf you'd like to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you\ncan claim a special offer.\nThey'll send you five free travel packs\nplus a year supplies, excuse me,\nof vitamin D3+K2.\nSo you get the five free travel packs\nand a year supply of D3\nif you go to\nwww.athleticgreens.com/huberman\nyou can claim that special offer.\nFor the last month four\nepisodes to be exact,\nwe've been discussing physical performance\nand skill learning.\nWe've talked about how\nto learn skills faster,\nwhether or not those are\nskills, athletic performance,\ndance, music, things of that sort.\nWe've also talked about\nhow to gain strength\nand how to lose fat faster by\nleveraging the nervous system.\nThings like shiver and non-shiver,\nnon-exercise activity\ninduced thermogenesis.\nWe talked about how neurons\ncan actually trigger\naccelerated fat loss.\nWe talked about hypertrophy\nalso called muscle growth\nand we covered everything\nfrom sets and reps protocols,\nhow long to stay in a cold ice bath?\nWhen to get out?\nHow to keep shivering?\nWe've covered a lot of\ntools and a lot of science.\nSo if you're interested in those things\nand you even perhaps want\nto learn a little bit about\nhow we make energy ATP from\ncarbohydrates or from fats,\nit's all covered in the\nprevious four episodes.\nThis was going to be the time\nthat we moved to a new topic entirely,\nbut we are going to do one\nmore episode in this series\non physical performance.\nFor the simple reason that\nyou asked many questions\nabout something that's vitally important\nboth for physical\nperformance and long-term\nand short-term health\nand that's endurance.\nAnd so today we are going\nto talk about endurance.\nNow, if you're a strength athlete\nor you're not interested in endurance,\ndon't depart just yet,\nbecause it turns out that there\nare ways to train endurance\nthat are very different\nthan I would have previously imagined.\nIf you only think about long runs,\nlong swims, marathons,\nhalf marathons, 10Ks, 5Ks\nand that sort of thing puts you to sleep\nkind of like Costello is\nsnoring in the background\nright now.\nHe's not a long distance\nendurance athlete,\nthat's for sure.\nIf you're interested in those things\nor if you are averse to those things,\nI encourage you to continue listening\nbecause we are going to talk\nabout a little bit of science\nand then some specific protocols\nthat really define what endurance is?\nThe four types of endurance\nand ways to train those in\nconcert with the other things\nthat you might be doing\nlike weight training\nor skill training or yoga.\nAnd if you are an endurance athlete,\nwe are going to cover a\nlot of tools and science\nthat I'm certain will also\nhelp enhance your training\nand performance in races\nor even just recreationally.\nThe topic of endurance I think\nhas been badly misrepresented,\nfrankly, online.\nAnd when you'd start\ndigging into the science\nand you start talking to\nreal experts in this area,\nwhat you discover, what\nI've discovered is that,\nit's an incredibly interesting area\nbecause it teaches us so\nmuch about how our body\nand our brain use fuels and\nhow we can control which fuels\nare used by our body and brain?\nSo today we will talk about\nthe four kinds of endurance.\nWe will also cover the topic of hydration\nwhich might sound incredibly boring.\nLike, okay, just drink more water.\nBut it's really interesting\nbecause not only is\nhydration a limiting factor\non performance,\nbut there is a right way to hydrate,\nand there is a wrong way to hydrate.\nThere actually is a formula\nthat I'll teach you to know\nhow much water to be drinking\ndepending on your activity levels.\nAnd if that sounds like a simple thing,\nlike, oh, just tap off water\nuntil your urine runs clear.\nThat's actually the wrong advice.\nIt turns out that if you\ndon't hydrate properly,\nyou can see 20 to 30%\nreductions in performance,\nwhether or not that strength,\nwhether that's increasing hypertrophy,\nwhether or not that's running, swimming,\neven mental performance.\nSo even if you're not an athlete\nor a recreational athlete at all,\nI encourage you to stay tuned\nfor the part about hydration.\nSo we're going to cover as\nusual a little bit of science\nand then we're going to\ndive right into protocols\nthat you can apply if you like,\nand if you deem those\ncorrect and safe for you.\nBefore we dive into all that,\nI want to make an important announcement,\nwhich has all the episodes\nof the Huberman Lab Podcast\nare now housed on a single website,\nwhich is www.hubermanlab.com.\nIf you go to www.hubermanlab.com,\nyou can find all the episodes in YouTube,\nApple and Spotify format with links there.\nThe website is also searchable.\nSo if you go into the\nlittle search function\nwhich you'll find very easily,\nand you put in, for\ninstance, creatine or sleep\nor ice bath or sauna,\nit will take you to the specific episodes\nthat contain that information.\nAnd in addition, if you go to the website\nwww.hubermanlab.com,\nyou have the opportunity to sign up\nfor what we call the\nHuberman Lab Neural Network.\nThe Huberman Lab Neural\nNetwork is a zero cost resource\nwhere once a month perhaps more often\nyou'll receive a email newsletter,\nand that newsletter will\ncontain specific protocols,\nannouncements, attachments of\nPDFs and things of that sort\nof protocols, tools and\nscience from the podcast.\nWe will also make any\nannouncements about live lectures\nwhich at some point I'll\nprobably start doing\nin various cities in the US\nand probably around the world as well,\nas well as other things that I think\nwould be really useful to you\nall of course at zero cost.\nSo that's www.hubermanlab.com,\nsign up for the Neural Network newsletter.\nYou can find that in the menu tab\nor it might pop up when you get there.\nAnd I hope you will join.\nAnd as a final announcement,\nif you're not already\nfollowing us on Instagram,\nyou can go to Huberman Lab on Instagram.\nAnd if you do that,\nI often make announcements\nand release protocols\nand links to protocols\nand things there as well.\nI briefly want to touch on something\nfrom the previous episode which is that,\nif you are somebody that is trying\nto increase muscle strength and or size,\nor if you're simply somebody\nwho doesn't want to increase\nmuscle strength and size,\nand you just want to maintain\nthe musculature that you have,\nit's vital that you\nperform at least five sets\nof resistance training\nper muscle per week.\nIf we don't do that, we\nlose muscle over time.\nAnd that is one reason among many\nto have a regular resistance\ntraining protocol.\nNobody wants to start resembling\na folded over envelope\nor a melted candle.\nNo one wants to have challenges\ngetting up out of a chair\nor off the ground.\nMaintaining musculature is vital,\nnot just to our immediate health,\nbut to our long-term health trajectory.\nSo I just want to emphasize that point.\nIf you're curious about\nthe sets, the reps,\nhow close to failure to go or not go?\nWhether or not you should be doing\nyour cardiovascular training\nbefore or after your weight training?\nAll of that is in the previous episode\nright down to the details,\nand I like to think made\nsimple for you to understand.\nBut I do strongly believe\nthat resistance training\nwhether or not it's with body\nweight or bands or weights\nor simply lifting rocks in\nthe yard or logs in the yard\nis vital for our systemic\nphysiology and our overall health,\nand that includes our brain health.\nAnd I described the reasons\nfor that and the mechanisms\nin the previous episode.\nToday, I'd like to talk about endurance\nand how to build endurance,\nand how to use endurance for\nthe health of your entire body.\nEndurance, as the name suggests\nis our ability to engage\nin continuous bouts of exercise,\nor continuous movement or\ncontinuous effort of any kind.\nAnd I do believe that our\nability to engage in activities\nthat we call endurance training\nor physical endurance activities\ndo have carry over to\nmental performance of things\nthat require long-term effort.\nI'll touch on that at the end\nand why there's reason to believe\nthat there is a biological crossover\nbetween those two things.\nI don't think it's simply the case\nthat if you train\nyourself to be a strength\nand speed athlete and to\ndo short bouts of exercise\nare very intense,\nthat you can only do mental work\nthat's of short bouts and very intense.\nBut it is clear that\ncardiovascular exercise,\nexercise where you're\ngetting your heart rate up\ncontinuously for a period of time,\nand endurance exercise we will define\nwhat that is in a moment,\nis vital for tapping into\nand enhancing various aspects\nof our biology in the\nbody end in the brain\nsuch that our brain can perform work\nfor longer periods of time,\nfocused work, learning, et cetera.\nSo I want to dive into\nthe topic of endurance\nand I want to just begin\nby addressing something\nthat's vital to any kind of effort,\nwhether that's mental\neffort or physical effort.\nSo as always a little bit of science\nand we'll get right into protocols.\nSo the key thing to understand\nabout energy production in the body,\nmeaning your ability to think,\nyour ability to talk,\nyour ability to walk,\nyour ability to run is this\nthing that we call ATP.\nATP and mitochondria,\nwhich are just little\nwhat we call organelles within cells.\nThese little factories that\nmake energy, if you will.\nATP is required for anything\nthat requires energy,\nfor anything that you\ndo that requires effort.\nAnd there are different ways to get ATP.\nAnd we have been gifted as\na species with the ability\nto convert lots of things into ATP.\nWe can convert carbohydrates,\nliterally the kinds of\ncarbohydrates eat a bagel,\nyou eat a piece of pizza.\nPizza usually is dough, and it has cheese\nand some other things.\nCostello hears me talking about pizza.\nCostello loves pizza, by the way.\nEating a piece of pizza,\nit gets converted into various things,\nfatty acids from the fats,\nglucose from the bread,\nand those things get converted\ninto ATP within cells,\nthrough things like like\nglycolysis, things like lipolysis.\nI talked about this in previous episodes.\nSo our muscles and our neurons\nuse different fuel sources\nto generate ATP.\nThe ones that are used\nfirst for short bouts\nof intense activity are\nthings like phosphocreatine.\nIf you've only heard about\ncreatine as a supplement.\nWell, phosphocreatine actually\nexists on our muscles,\nand that's why people take creatine.\nYou can load your muscles\nwith more creatine.\nAnd though, and excuse me.\nPhosphocreatine is great for\nshort, intense bouts of effort.\nSo when you're really pushing\nhard on something physical,\nlet's say you see a car\non the side of the road\nand that car is stalled and a person says,\n\"Hey, can you help me push my car?\"\nAnd you start to push.\nThat's going to be phosphocreatine\nis going to be your main fuel source.\nThen you start to tap\ninto things like glucose\nwhich is literally just\ncarbohydrate is the sugar\nthat's in your blood.\nAnd then if you keep pushing on that car,\nyou keep engaging in a particular effort,\nor you keep studying or you\nkeep listening to this podcast,\nyou start to tap into other\nfuel sources like glycogen\nfrom your liver, which is just,\nit's like a little pack,\njust like you might have packed a sandwich\nor something for work.\nYou have a little pack\nof glycogen in your liver\nthat you can rely on.\nAnd you have fat stored in adipose tissue.\nEven if you have very, very\nlow body fat percentage\nlike you're one of these people\nas like 3% or 5% body fat\nreally thin skin, very little body fat,\nyou can extract lipids fatty\nacids from that body fat.\nIt's like a storage pack,\nit is a storage pack for energy\nthat can be converted to ATP.\nSo without going into any more detail,\nwhen I say today energy or I say ATP,\njust remember that\nregardless of your diet,\nregardless of your nutritional plan,\nyour body has the\ncapacity to use creatine,\nglucose, glycogen, lipids.\nAnd if you're ketogenic, ketones.\nWe'll talk about ketosis.\nIn order to generate fuel, energy.\nNow, the other crucial point is that,\nin order to complete that\nprocess of taking these fuels\nand converting them into energy,\nmost of the time you need oxygen.\nYou need air basically in your system.\nNow, it's not actual air.\nYou need oxygen molecules in your system,\ncomes in through your mouth and your nose,\ngoes to your lungs and\ndistributes via the bloodstream.\nOxygen is not a fuel,\nbut like a fire that has no oxygen\nyou can't actually burn the logs,\nbut when you blow a lot\nof oxygen onto a fire,\nbasically, onto logs with a flame there,\nthen basically it will take fire,\nit will burn.\nOkay?\nOxygen allows you to burn fuel.\nSo today we are going to\nask the critical questions.\nWhat allows us to perform?\nWhat allows us to continue\neffort for long periods of time?\nAnd that effort could be a run,\nit could be a swim,\nit could be studying,\nit could be anything that extends\nover a long period of time.\nWell, you're going to need energy\nand you're going to need oxygen.\nBut the way to answer a question\nlike what allows us to endure, right?\nEndurance.\nWhat allows us to keep going?\nWell, we think of things like willpower.\nBut what's willpower?\nWillpower is neurons.\nIt's neurons in our brain.\nWe have this thing called\nthe central governor\nwhich decides whether or not\nwe should or could continue\nor whether or not we should stop,\nwhether or not we should quit.\nOkay?\nSo whether or not you're somebody\nwho has a lot of what\nwe would call resilience\nand endurance,\nor whether or not you're\nsomebody who taps out early\nand quits early or can't\nhandle frustration,\nthat has to do with your fuel utilization\nand specific neurons.\nSo we have to ask the question,\nwhat is the limiting\nfactor on performance?\nRight?\nSo instead of saying,\nwhat allows us to endure?\nWe should say, what\nprevents us from enduring?\nWhat prevents us from moving forward?\nWhat are the factors that say,\nyou know what?\nNo more, I'm not going\nto continue this run.\nOr you know what?\nI've had a really long, hard day\nor maybe I've had an easy\nday or I'm feeling lazy,\nI just don't even really feel\nlike getting up and moving.\nSo what we're going to talk about today\nactually gets right down\nto the heart of motivation\nand fuel use.\nMotivation and fuel allocation.\nAnd we are going to talk about\nspecific training protocols\nthat you can follow that have carry over\nbetween the bodily systems of\nrunning swimming, et cetera,\nand the way that your brain works.\nSo let's talk about\nendurance by asking first,\nwhat are the limiting\nfactors on endurance?\nWhat stops us?\nBecause in addressing\nthat and answering that,\nwe will understand what\nallows us to get into effort\nand to continue effort.\nThere are five main categories of things\nthat allow us to engage in effort.\nAnd they are neurons, nerves, muscle,\nmuscle, blood, things in our blood,\nour heart and our lungs.\nNow, I don't want to\ncompletely write off things\nlike the immune system and\nother systems of the body,\nbut nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs\nare the five that I\nwant to focus on today,\nbecause that's where most of the data are.\nAs we go forward into this,\nI want to acknowledge Dr. Andy Galpin,\nwho as with the last episode,\nhas been tremendously\nhelpful and informative\nin terms of the exercise physiology.\nHe's a true expert.\nHe has a laboratory,\nhe's a full professor who\ndoes work on muscle biopsy,\nwho understands the science,\nbut who also works with athletes\nand works with recreational athletes,\nprofessional athletes really understands\nat a variety of levels how\nall these systems work?\nHe's the person I consulted\nwith about today's episode,\nalthough I did access\nother literature as well.\nAnd I'm going to mention a\nkey review for any of you,\nafficionados, who really want\nto get down into the weeds.\nBut I encourage you,\nif you want more detail\nto check out Dr. Andy\nGalpin's YouTube page,\nI think he's also on Twitter.\nHe's definitely on Instagram.\nHis content is excellent,\nand he really understands...\nI have learned and I really believe\nthat an intellectual is somebody\nwho understands a topic at multiple levels\nof specificity of detail\nand can communicate that.\nAnd Andy is a true intellectual\nof muscle physiology\nand performance.\nAnd if you hear the word intellectual\nand you kind of back up\nand cringe from that,\nunderstand that he's also a practitioner.\nSo thank you, Andrew Galpin.\nAndy Galpin for your\nsupport in these episodes\nand we hope to have you as\na guest on the podcast soon.\nSo nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.\nLet's talk about neurons\nand how they work.\nOkay?\nBut I want to tell you about an experiment\nthat's going to make it very clear\nwhy quitting is a mental\nthing not a physical thing.\nSo why do we quit?\nWell, an experiment was\ndone a couple years ago\nand was published in the journal Cell.\nCell Press journal, excellent journal\nshowing that there is a class\nof neurons in our brain stem,\nin the back of our brain that\nif they shut off, we quit.\nNow, these neurons release epinephrin.\nEpinephrin is adrenaline.\nAnd anytime we are engaged\nin effort of any kind,\nwe are releasing epinephrin.\nAnytime we're awake really,\nwe are releasing epinephrin\ninto our brain.\nIn fact, this little roup of neurons\nin the back of our brain is\ncalled the locus coeruleus\nif you like.\nIt's churning out epinephrin all the time,\nbut if something stresses us out,\nit churns out more and then it acts\nas kind of an alertness\nsignal for the whole brain.\nWe also of course have\nadrenaline epinephrin\nreleased in our body which\nmakes our body ready for things.\nSo think about epinephrin\nas a readiness signal.\nAnd when we are engaged in effort,\nthis readiness signal is\nbeing churned into our brain.\nWhen we relax and we're falling asleep,\nepinephrin levels are low.\nOkay, so they did a really\ninteresting experiment\nwhere they had subjects\nengage in bouts of effort\nof trying to move forward toward a goal.\nBut they manipulated\nthe visual environment\nwith the stripes,\nkind of like fences passing\non both sides of them.\nAnd by doing that, they\ncould trick subjects\ninto thinking that their\neffort was either allowing them\nto move forward, right?\nBecause these rungs on the\nfence were moving past,\nor that their effort was futile\nthat they were no longer moving forward\nbecause they would make\nthe runs move slowly\neven though the subjects\nwere making a lot of effort\nto move forward.\nOkay?\nSo this is analogous or\nsimilar to being on a treadmill\nand you're trying to\nwalk on this treadmill\nand you just can't move\nthe conveyor, right?\nOr you're in virtual reality\nand you're putting a ton of effort,\nbut it seems like you're\nmoving excruciatingly slow.\nI had this experience\nrecently in real life.\nI was doing a swim in the Pacific,\nI was trying to go\nsouth and I was swimming\nand I was caught in a current,\nnot the cup that pulls you out to ocean.\nAnd I kept looking to my left,\nand I saw this hotel on the shoreline,\nand then I was swimming and swimming\nand swimming and swimming,\nand 20 minutes later I looked\nto my left and the hotel\nis still exactly where it was before,\nwhich meant that I wasn't moving.\nIt felt futile.\nEventually, either the current\nchanged or something changed\nand I eventually swam past the hotel,\ngot back on the beach and\neventually drove home.\nThat's essentially what\nthey did in this experiment.\nBut what they found was these neurons\nthat release epinephrin,\nthere's another cell type called glia,\nwhich actually means glue in Latin,\nthat is paying attention\nto how much epinephrin\nis being released.\nAnd at some point the\nsystem reaches a threshold.\nIt reaches this threshold\nand it shuts off the\nrelease of more epinephrin.\nIt's like I quit, that's it,\nno more effort signal.\nIf they could extend the time\nbefore those glia said, ah, enough.\nIf they could release more\nadrenaline into the system,\nthen subjects would keep going.\nSo our desire to continue\nor put differently,\nour willingness to continue\nand our desire to quit\nis mediated by events\nbetween our two ears.\nNow, that doesn't mean that\nthe body's not involved,\nbut it means that neurons\nare critically important.\nSo we have two categories of\nneurons that are important.\nThe ones in our head that tell us get up\nand go out and take that run.\nAnd the ones that allow us\nand encourage us to continue\nthat run,\nand we have neurons that shut things off\nand say no more.\nAnd we of course have the neurons\nthat connect to our muscles\nand control our muscles.\nBut the reason we quit is\nrarely because our body quits,\nour mind quits.\nNow, we never want to encourage people\nto drive themselves to\nthe point of injury,\nthat's not going to be good for anybody,\nbut it is good to know that it's neural.\nOur ability to persist is neural.\nSo when people say is it, I hear that,\nyou know, sports or effort or fighting,\nor it's 90% mental, 10% physical.\nThat whole discussion\nabout how much is mental,\nhow much is physical?\nIs absolutely silly.\nIt just proves that there's no knowledge\nof the underlying biology\nbehind that statement.\nIt's neither mental nor physical.\nEverything is physical,\neverything is neurons.\nYour thinking is the\nresponsibility of chemicals\nand electrical signals in your head.\nSo it's not 90% mental, 10% physical.\nIt's not 50/50.\nIt's not 70/30, it's 100% nervous system.\nIt's neurons.\nOkay?\nSo when people say mental or physical,\nunderstand it's 100% neural.\nAnd I'd love for the,\nhow much of it is mental\nand how much is physical\nto just disappear.\nThat argument means nothing\nand it's not actionable.\nNow, what do nerves need in\norder to continue to fire?\nWhat do you need in order\nto get neurons to say,\nI will persist.\nWell, they need glucose.\nUnless you're on keto\nand ketogenic adapted,\nyou need carbohydrate is glucose.\nThat's what neurons run on.\nAnd you need electrolytes.\nNeurons have what's called\na sodium potassium pump\nblah, blah, blah.\nThey generate electricity.\nWe could go into all this.\nI will probably do an entire lecture\nabout the action potential,\nbut basically in order to\nget nerve cells to fire,\nto contract muscle,\nto say, I'm going to continue.\nYou need sufficient sodium, salt,\nbecause the action potential\nthe actual firing of neurons\nis driven by sodium entering the cell,\nrushing into the cell.\nAnd then there's a removal of potassium.\nAnd then there's a kind of\nresetting of those levels\nby something called the\nsodium potassium pump.\nAnd the sodium potassium pump and sodium\nand action potentials,\neven if you don't know anything\nabout that is ATP dependent.\nIt requires energy.\nSo you need energy in order\nto get neurons to fire.\nAnd it is pH dependent.\nIt depends on the conditions\nor the environment within the\nbrain being of a certain pH\nor acidity.\npH is about how acid or how\nbasic the environment is?\nAnd we will talk a little\nbit about pH in simple terms\nso you can understand.\nSo nerves need salt, they need potassium.\nAnd it turns out they need magnesium\nand you need glucose and carbohydrates\nin order to power those neurons,\nunless you are running on ketones.\nAnd to run on ketones,\nyou have to make sure that\nyou're fully keto adapted.\nI will talk about adding in\nketones on top of carbohydrate\nat the end of the episode.\nOkay, so that's how nerves work.\nYou need carbohydrate,\nyou need sodium, potassium and magnesium\nin order to drive the brain.\nMuscle.\nMuscle is going to engage\nin generating energy first\nby using this phosphocreatine system.\nHigh bouts of effort\nreally intense effort,\nshort-lived seconds to minutes,\nbut probably more like seconds\nis going to be this phosphate\ncreating literally a fuel source\nin the muscle that you're going to burn,\njust like you would logs on a fire.\nAnd glycogen which is stored\ncarbohydrate in the muscle,\nthat also can be burned\njust like logs on a fire\nto generate energy.\nSo let me make this crystal clear.\nIf you move your wrist\ntowards your shoulder\nand contract your bicep really hard,\nmuscle fibers are burning\nup their own carbohydrate.\nThey're converting that into ATP\nin order to generate that energy.\nOkay?\nAnd pH is important and\ntemperature is important.\nIn the episode on supercharge\nyour physical performance,\nI talked all about how by\nusing cooling specifically\nof the palms or the bottoms of the feet\nor the cheeks of the face\nusing particular methods,\nyou can adjust the temperature\nof the body and of muscle\nin a way that allows you to do more work,\nto do more reps, to run further,\nto keep going and to persist.\nAnd that's because if temperature\nis too low or too high,\nthen ATP is not going to be available\nbecause of this whole thing\ncalled the pyruvate kinase pathway\nand the temperature\ndependence of pyruvate kinase.\nCheck out that episode if you\nwant to learn more about that.\nBut temperature is important\nand pH is also important.\nSo we got nerve, muscle,\nand then there's stuff in our blood\nthat's available as an energy source.\nAnd in blood, we got glucose.\nSo literally blood sugar\nthat's floating around.\nSo let's say you have\nfasted for three days,\nyour blood glucose is\ngoing to be very low.\nSo that's not going to\nbe a great fuel source,\nbut you will start to liberate fats\nfrom your adipose tissue from your fat.\nFatty acids will start to\nmobilize into the bloodstream\nand you can burn those for energy.\nAnd oxygen in your blood when\nyou inhale, [inhales deeply]\nyou're bringing oxygen into your blood.\nSo these are all fuel\nsources in your neurons,\nin your muscle, in your blood,\nin your various tissues that\nare providing the opportunity\nto induce effort whether\nor not it's a run or swim\nor writing or talking.\nNow, there are some other\nfactors that are important\nand those are the heart\nwhich is going to move blood.\nSo the more that the heart\ncan move blood and oxygen,\nwell, the more fuel that's\ngoing to be available for you\nto engage in muscular\neffort and thinking effort.\nSo your heart vitally important\nto your muscles ability\nto work and your brain's ability to work.\nAnd as I've mentioned, oxygen a few times,\nit should be obvious then that\nthe lungs are very important.\nYou need to bring oxygen in,\nand distribute it to all these tissues,\nbecause oxygen is critical\nfor the conversion\nof carbohydrates and\nthe conversion of fats.\nAnd we could get into the discussion about\nwhether or not oxygen is important\nfor ketogenic metabolism,\nbut you need oxygen there,\nyou need to breathe and you\nneed to breathe properly.\nSo I just covered what would\nnormally be about four lectures\nof energy consumption\nand energy utilization.\nI didn't go into much detail at all.\nBut what I want you to imagine is that,\nyou've got these different cell types.\nYou've got neurons, you've got muscle,\nthey need to collaborate\nin order to generate effort\nor to make the decision to do something\nor to think hard or to\nrun hard or to run far.\nAnd then you've got fuel\nsources both in the neurons,\nin the muscle, in your blood,\nand then the heart and\nlungs are going to help\ndistribute the oxygen and those fuels.\nAnd of course you have\nthat little energy pack\nthat we call the liver that\nwill allow you to pull out\na little more carbohydrate\nif you need it for work.\nOkay?\nSo that's as much as I want to\ncover about energy consumption,\nbecause that's a lot.\nBut what it tells you is that when you eat\nand you use food as a fuel source,\nthat food can be broken down\nand you can immediately burn the glucose\nthat's in your bloodstream,\nor you can rely on some of\nthe stored fuel in your liver,\nor you can rely on stored\nfuel in the muscle,\nso-called glycogen.\nAnd there are a lot of different ways\nthat we can generate ATP.\nSo when we ask the question,\nwhat's limiting for performance?\nWhat is going to allow us to endure,\nto engage in effort and\nendure long bouts of effort\nor even moderately long bouts of effort?\nWe need to ask which of those things,\nnerve, muscle, blood, heart\nand lungs is limiting?\nOr put differently,\nwe ask, what should we be\ndoing with our neurons?\nWhat should we be doing with our muscles?\nWhat should we be doing with our blood?\nWhat should we be doing with our heart\nand what should we be doing with our lungs\nthat's going to allow\nus to build endurance\nfor mental and physical work\nand to be able to go longer,\nfurther with more intensity?\nThat's the real question?\nHow can we do more work?\nAnd the way we do that is with energy,\nand the way to get energy to it,\nis to buy those five things.\nAnd so now we're going to talk about,\nhow you can actually build\ndifferent types of endurance?\nAnd what that does at\nthe level of your blood,\nyour heart, your muscles and your neurons.\nSo we're going to skip back and\nforth between protocols, tools\nand the underlying science.\nSo rather than heavy stack\nthe science at the front end\nand then just give you\nall the tools at the end,\nwe're going to talk about the protocols,\nthe four kinds of endurance\nand how to achieve them?\nAnd we are going to talk\nabout the underlying science\nas we move through that.\nIf you would like a lot\nof detailed science,\nI encourage you to check out a review\nthat we've linked in the show notes.\nAnd the review is called\nadaptations to endurance\nand strength training.\nThis is a review article with\nmany excellent citations.\nIt's from Cold Spring Harbor\nPerspectives in Medicine.\nThe Cold Spring Harbor Press\nis an excellent scientific press.\nSpent the last 21 years doing\nsummers at Cold Spring Harbor\nteaching neuroscience,\nbut Cold Spring Harbor is\ninvolved in all sorts of themes\nand topics related to\nneuroscience and medicine.\nThis review by Hughes L.Ellefson.\nEllefson that's the name.\nEllefson and Barr, B-A-A-R.\nAdaptations through endurance\nand strength training\nis rich with citations.\nIt can be downloaded as a complete PDF.\nThere's no paywall and we will link to it.\nAnd it gets really deep into\nall the signaling cascades,\nthe genetic changes within muscle\nwith high intensity interval training,\nshort-term, super high intensity\ntraining, weight training.\nSo if you're a real nerd for this stuff\nand you want to get right\ndown into how PGC-1alpha,\nP53 and PH20 change the\nadaptation features of muscle\nand gene regulation,\nthat is definitely the review for you.\nIf you're like most people,\nand you're not really interested\nin that level of detail,\nno reason to pick up the review,\nunless you just want to check out\nsome of the figures and pictures.\nBut I do want to offer that as a resource\nit's been in addition to\ndiscussions with Dr. Andy Galpin,\nit's been a primary\nresource for the content\nof this episode.\nSo let's talk about the\nfour kinds of endurance\nand how to achieve those?\nI do believe that everybody\nshould have some sort\nof endurance practice,\nregular endurance practice.\nIt's clear that it's vital for\nthe functioning of the body\nand the mind.\nAnd there are clear longevity benefits.\nThere are a lot of\nreasons why that's true,\nbut the main one is that if we\nhave good energy utilization\nin our musculature and in our blood,\nin our vascular system and\nin our oxygenating system,\nour lungs, the so-called\ncardiovascular system,\nrespiratory system and musculature.\nThe body and brain function much better.\nThere are so many papers now,\nso much data to support that.\nSo I do believe everyone\nshould either try to maintain\nthe muscle that they have,\nprovided they've already\ngone through puberty\nand development.\nAnd they should be engaged in\nregular endurance exercise.\nNow, for many people, they\nthink endurance exercise.\nThat means what?\nA hour long run or I got\nto get on the StairMaster\nor I have to treadmill for\nhours on end each week.\nAnd it turns out that's not the case.\nThere are four kinds of endurance,\nand you can train specifically\nfor any one of those,\nand you can vary your training.\nSo let's talk about those\nfour kinds of endurance.\nThese are very interesting\nand they each have very\ndifferent protocols\nthat you use in order to\nbuild and maximize them.\nAnd now you'll understand\nwhat fuel sources they use\nin order to build that\nthing we call endurance.\nSo first of all, we\nhave muscular endurance.\nMuscular endurance is the\nability for our muscles\nto perform work over time,\nand our failure to continue\nto be able to perform\nthat work is going to be\ndue to muscular fatigue,\nnot to cardiovascular fatigue.\nSo not because we're breathing too hard\nor we can't get enough\nblood to the muscles\nor because we quit mentally,\nbut because the muscles\nthemselves give out.\nOkay?\nOne good example of this would be,\nif you had to pick up a stone in the yard\nand that stone is not\nextremely heavy for you,\nand you needed to do that\nanywhere from 50 to a 100 times,\nand you were picking it\nup and putting it down\nand picking it up and putting it down\nand picking up and putting it down.\nAt some point, your muscles will fatigue.\nThey will fail to endure.\nMuscular endurance is incredibly useful\nfor a variety of physical pursuits.\nAnd we will talk about the mental pursuits\nthat it supports as well.\nIn terms of physical pursuits,\nthe ability for a given muscle\nto perform repeated work\nis going to improve your golf swing.\nIt's going to improve your tennis swing.\nIt's going to improve your posture,\nyour ability to dance,\nyour ability to repeatedly\nengage in an activity\nthat requires effort in a\nway that's very different\nfrom the kind of endurance\nthat you will build simply\nby increasing your cardiovascular fitness,\nyour ability to generate\nkind of easy repetition.\nSo let's talk about muscular\nendurance and what it is?\nMuscular endurance is\ngoing to be something\nthat you can perform for\nanywhere from 12 to 25,\nor even up to 100 repetitions.\nAnd that's actually how if you like\nyou would train muscular endurance.\nAnd I'll give the specific\nprotocol in a few moments.\nSo a good example is push-ups, right?\nIf you were to get on the\nfloor and start doing push-ups,\neven if you're somebody who\nhas to do knees down push-ups,\nand you're doing your push-ups,\neventually you won't be\nable to do any more push-ups\nand that's not going to be\nbecause you couldn't get enough\noxygen into your system,\nor your heart wasn't pumping enough blood.\nIt's going to be because the muscles fail.\nThat's why.\nSo if you want to be\nable to do more push-ups\nor even more pull-ups.\nMuscular endurance is\nreally what it's about.\nIt's actually no coincidence\nthat a lot of military bootcamp\nstyle training is not done with weights,\nit's done with things\nlike push-ups, pull-ups,\nsit-ups and running.\nBecause what they're really\nbuilding is muscular endurance.\nThe ability to perform\nwork repeatedly over time\nfor a given set of muscles and neurons.\nSo what's a good protocol\nto build muscular endurance.\nLet's just give that to you now\nand explain some of the\nunderlying science as it follows.\nSo a really good muscular\nendurance training protocol\naccording to the scientific\nliterature would be,\nthree to five sets of anywhere\nfrom 12 to 100 repetitions.\nThat's a huge range.\nNow, 12 to 25 repetitions is\ngoing to be more reasonable\nfor most people.\nAnd the rest periods\nare going to be anywhere\nfrom 30 to 180 seconds of rest.\nSo anywhere from half a minute\nto three minutes of rest.\nSo this might be five sets of push-ups,\ndone getting your maximum push-ups\nalthough for some people\nthat might be zero\nand you have to do it knees down.\nFor some people it might be 10 push-ups,\nfor some people might be 25,\nbut you could go all the way up to 100.\nRest anywhere from 30 to 180 seconds,\nand then do your next set\nfor a total of three to five sets.\nSo it doesn't actually\nsound like a ton of work.\nThe other thing you could do\nis something like a plank.\nA plank position is actually a way\nto build muscular endurance, not strength.\nOkay?\nI'm sure it could be\nused to develop strength,\nbut it's really about muscular endurance.\nSo you would do three\nto five sets of planks.\nThose planks would probably even\nbecause you're not doing repetitions,\nit's an isometric hold as we say,\nas kind of static hold or a wall sit\nwould be another example.\nAnd you would do that probably\nfor a minute or two minutes,\ntake some rest of anywhere\nfrom 30, 60, or 180 seconds,\nand then repeat.\nSo things like pushing a sled, push-ups,\nisometric planks, even pull-ups,\nthose will all work.\nAnd as with others forms of training,\nyou would want to do this,\nuntil you approach\nfailure or actually fail\nand where you're unable to\nperform another repetition\nthat would mark the end of a set.\nThe one critical feature of\nbuilding muscular endurance\nis that it has no major east\ncentric loading component.\nNow, I haven't talked much about eccentric\nand concentric loading.\nBut concentric loading is\nwhen you are shortening\nthe muscle typically or lifting a weight.\nAnd east centric movements\nare when you are lengthening\na muscle typically\nor lowering a weight.\nSo if you do a pull up and\nyou get your chin over the bar\nor a chin up, that's the\nconcentric portion of the effort,\nand then as you lower yourself,\nthat's the eccentric portion.\nEccentric portion of resistance\ntraining of any kind,\nwhether or not it's for\nendurance or for strength\nis one of the major causes of soreness.\nSome people will be more\nsusceptible to this,\nexcuse me than others,\nbut it does create more\ndamage in muscle fibers.\nMuscular endurance and\nbuilding muscular endurance\nshould not include any movements\nthat include major eccentric loads.\nSo if you're going to do push-ups,\nit doesn't mean that you want to drop,\nyou know, smash your chest into the floor.\nAnd by the way your chest\nshould touch the ground\non every push-up.\nThat's a real push-up.\nOkay?\nIt's not about breaking\n90 with the elbows,\nit's about pushing down until\nyour chest touch the floor\nand straightening out.\nThat's a proper push-up.\nAnd a pull-up is where you pull\nup your chin above the bar.\nNeither of those should\ninclude a slow eccentric\nor lowering component.\nIf you are using those to\ntrain muscular endurance\nthe three to five sets of 12 to 25\nand maybe even up to 100 repetitions\nwith 3,280 seconds of rest in between.\nThat means that jumping also\nis going to be a very poor tool\nfor building muscular endurance,\nbecause jumping has a slowing\ndown component as you land.\nSo things like plyometrics or agility work\nwhere you're moving from side to side,\nand you're decelerating,\nyou're slowing yourself down a lot,\nnot going to be good\nfor muscular endurance.\nTerrific for cardiovascular training\nand conditioning of other\nkinds and skill training\nand agility and all that.\nBut if you want to build\nmuscular endurance,\nyou want to make your muscles\nable to do more work for longer.\nIt's going to be this three to five sets\nof 12 to 100 reps,\n30 to 180 seconds of\nmainly concentric movement.\nOkay?\nNot a slow lowering phase\nor a heavy lowering phase.\nSo that might be kettlebell\nswings and things of that sort.\nIsometrics, as I mentioned,\nthings like planks\nand wall sets will work.\nNow, what's interesting\nabout this is that,\nit doesn't seem at all\nlike what people normally\nthink of as endurance.\nAnd yet it's been shown in nice, quality\npeer-reviewed studies,\nseveral of which are cited in the review\nI mentioned earlier,\nthat muscular endurance\ncan improve our ability\nto engage in long bouts of\nwhat we call long duration,\nlow-intensity endurance work.\nSo this can support long runs.\nIt can support long swims.\nAnd it can build also...\nIt can build postural strength\nand endurance simultaneously\nand that's mainly accomplished\nthrough isometrical.\nSo things like planks\nare actually quite good\nfor building endurance of\nthe spinal erector muscles\nthat provide posture of\nthe abdominal muscles\nthat are helpful for\nposture for being upright\nfor the upper neck muscles\nand things of that sort.\nThese days everyone\nseems to have texts neck.\nEveryone is basically staring\nat their toes all the time\nas a default towards their toes.\nSo isometric holds can be very good\nfor building muscular endurance.\nYou can spot people including yourself,\nperhaps with poor muscular\nendurance in the postural muscles\nbecause anytime they stop moving,\nthey have to lean against a wall\nor their hip will move to one side,\nor they're always leaned to one side.\nI am guilty of this too.\nSome of you have actually pointed out.\nI like to think out of concern\nthat I often am rubbing my lower back.\nAnd indeed I have some\nasymmetries of my postural muscles\nsome of which are probably genetic\nand some of which are probably\njust from excessive work\nor something of that sort\nthat have my right shoulder\nset lower than my left\nand things of that sort.\nIf I wanted to improve those,\nI could improve those by\nreally focusing on symmetry\nand isometric.\nSymmetry meaning holding my\nhands at equivalent positions\nin planks and doing isometric holds\nfor building muscular endurance\nof the postural muscles.\nBut this can also be done with,\nas I mentioned, kettlebell\nswings for the lower back\nand legs and posterior chain.\nSo there are a number\nof different exercises\nyou could do this with,\nbut it should be compound\nexercises mainly.\nIt's rare for people to do\nthis kind of muscular endurance\nwork specifically for things\nlike bicep curls or triceps.\nAnd there aren't many activities\nthat really rely on\nisolation of those muscles\nand repeatedly, right?\nIt's hard...\nI'm sure there are some out there,\nbut it's kind of hard to imagine.\nSo you can do this with isometrics,\nyou can do this with more standard\nnon-isometric type movements,\nbut make sure there isn't\na strong eccentric load.\nSo now let's talk about\nthe science briefly\nof why this works?\nWell, that takes us back to\nthis issue of fuel utilization\nand what fails?\nSo if we would say, okay,\nlet's say you do a plank\nand you're planking for,\nyou know, maybe you're\nable to plank for a minute\nor two minutes or three minutes.\nAt some point you will fail.\nYou're not going to fail\nbecause the heart gives out.\nYou're not going to fail because\nyou can't get enough oxygen\nbecause you can breathe\nwhile you're doing that.\nYou're going to fail because\nof local muscular failure.\nWhich means that as you do,\nif you choose to do this\nprotocol of three to five sets,\net cetera, et cetera, to\nbuild muscular endurance,\nmainly what you are going to be building\nis you're going to be building the ability\nof your mitochondria to use oxygen\nto generate energy locally.\nAnd that is something called\nmitochondrial respiration.\nRespiration because of\nthe involvement of oxygen.\nAnd it's also going to\nbe increasing the extent\nto which the neurons control the muscles\nand provide a stimulus for\nthe muscles to contract.\nBut this is independent\nof power and strength.\nOkay?\nSo even though the low sets\nlike three to five sets\nand the fact that you're doing repetitions\nand you're going to failure,\neven though it seems to\nresemble power and strength\nand hypertrophy type training,\nit is distinctly different.\nIt's not going to generate\nstrength, hypertrophy and power.\nIt's going to mainly create\nthis ability to endure\nto continually contract muscles\nor repeatedly contract muscles.\nOkay?\nContinually if you're\nusing isometric holds,\nrepeatedly, excuse me,\nif you're using repetition type exercise\nwhere there's a contraction\nand an extension the muscle\nessentially concentric\nand an eccentric portion.\nBut remember that you want the\neccentric portion to be light\nand relatively fast,\nnot so fast that you injure yourself,\nbut certainly not\ndeliberately slowed down.\nIt was recommended, I\nshould say by Andy Galpin\nthat you not use Olympic lifts for this,\nbecause once you get past\neight or 12 or 25 repetitions,\nespecially form on those\nOlympic lifts is key\nfor not getting injured.\nAnd while some people can\nperform those sorts of of lifts\nlikes snatches and deadlifts\nand cleans and jerks\nand overhead presses,\nprobably not a great idea if\nthe goal is to push the body\nto points of fatigue,\nbecause you do open yourself up to injury,\nunless you're very skilled at doing that,\nor you have a really good coach\nwho can help you guide\nthrough those lifts.\nSo that's one form of endurance\nwhich is muscular endurance.\nAnd it's mainly going to\nrely on neural energy.\nSo nerves and muscle.\nAnd it's not going to rely quite so much\non what's available in your\nblood, your heart or your lungs.\nSo now let's talk about the\nother extreme of endurance\nwhich is long duration endurance.\nThis is the type that\npeople typically think about\nwhen they think about endurance.\nYou're talking about a\nlong run, a long swim,\na long bike ride.\nWell, how long we'll\nanywhere from 12 minutes\nto several hours or\nmaybe even an entire day,\nmaybe eight or nine hours of\nhiking or running or biking.\nSome people are actually doing those kinds\nof really long events\nmarathons, for instance.\nSo anything longer than 12 minutes.\nAnd this type of work\nbuilds on fuel utilization\nin the muscles,\nit builds on the activity\nof neurons in the brain\nthat are involved in what we call\ncentral pattern generators.\nWe talked about this in a previous episode\nor several previous episodes.\nThese are groups of\nneurons that allow our body\nto engage in regular rhythmic effort\nwithout having to think\nabout the movement too much.\nSo running and stepping or swimming\nif you already know how to swim,\nor peddling on a bike or\nwalking upstairs and hiking,\nyou're not thinking about\nright, left, right, left.\nIt's all carried out by\ncentral pattern generators.\nThis is going to be at\nless than a hundred percent\nof your maximum oxygen uptake,\nyour VO2 max, I'll talk\nabout what VO2 max is.\nBut I just want to give a\nsense of what the protocol is,\nand the underlying science.\nHow many sets?\nOne.\nLong duration effort is one\nset of 12 minutes or longer.\nSo you're not counting repetitions.\nI sure hope that if you're\ngoing out on a 30 minute run\nor even a 15 minute run,\nthat you're not counting steps,\nthat you're not counting pedal strokes,\nthat you're not on the rower\ncounting poles on the rower.\nI suppose you could,\nbut I think that would be pretty dreadful.\nSeems like a poor utilization\nof cognitive brain space.\nYou're getting into\nregular repeated effort\nand your ability to continue that effort\nis going to be dependent\nmainly on the efficiency\nof the movement on your\nability to strike a balance\nbetween the movement itself,\nthe generation of the muscular\nmovements that are required,\nand fuel utilization across\nthe different sources\nof nerve muscle, blood, heart and lungs.\nSo let's ask the question.\nWhy would you fail on a long run?\nWhy would you quit?\nWell, as you set out on that long run,\nassuming you have some\nglycogen in your liver\nand in your muscles, you're\ngoing to use that energy first,\neven if it's very low intensity.\nI guess we're not talking about sprinting,\nwe're talking about heading out the door\nor starting off on a marathon.\nYou're starting to assuming\nyou have some conditioning\nor even if you don't,\nyou're going to burn carbohydrate.\nYou're going to burn\nglucose in the bloodstream,\nyou're going to burn carbohydrate\nas those muscles contract.\nThose what we call slow twitch muscles.\nThey're contracting,\nthey start burning up fuel to make ATP\nto continue to contract.\nYour mind is going to\nuse more or less energy\ndepending on how much willpower,\nhow much of a fight you have\nto get into with yourself\nin order to generate the effort.\nI really want to underscore this.\nIf you're somebody that's thinking,\nmaybe I go for the run,\nmaybe I don't go for the run.\nI'll do it at two o'clock.\nOkay, 2:05.\nNo, I only want to go on the half hour\nor maybe on the main hour.\nAnd you're going through all that.\nGuess what?\nYou're burning up useful energy\nthat you could use either\nfor the run, for example,\nor for something else.\nWhen we think about something hard,\nwhen we ruminate,\nwhen we perseverate on\nan idea or on a decision,\nwe are burning neural\nenergy and neural energy\nis glucose and epinephrin\nand all the things\nwe talked about before.\nSo willpower in part is the ability\nto devote resources to things\nand part of that is making decisions\nto just either do it or not do it.\nI'm not of the just do it mindset.\nI think there's a right\ntime and a place to train.\nBut I also think that it is not good.\nIn other words, it utilizes\nexcessive resources\nto churn over decisions excessively,\nand you probably burn\nas much cognitive energy\ndeciding about whether or not\nto do a given training or not\nas you do in the actual training.\nOkay?\nSo we'll talk more about how\nthis long duration effort\ncan relate to mental performance,\nbut the long duration\neffort should be one set,\n12 minutes or longer.\nIt could go for 30 minutes\nor 60 minutes or an hour.\nWe'll talk about programming\nlater in the episode.\nThis is going to be less\nthan a hundred percent\nof your maximum oxygen uptake.\nYour heart rate is not going\nto be through the ceiling\nor maxed out.\nBut it's all about efficiency of movement.\nThat's what you're building.\nWhen you go out for a\nrun that's 30 minutes,\nyou are building the capacity\nto repeat that performance.\nThe next time, while being more efficient\nactually burning less fuel.\nAnd that might seem a\nlittle bit counterintuitive,\nbut every time you do that run,\nwhat you're doing is you're building up\nmitochondrial density.\nIt's not so much about\nmitochondrial oxidation\nand respiration.\nYou're building up mitochondrial density.\nYou're actually increasing\nthe amount of ATP\nthat you can create for\na given about of effort.\nYou're becoming more efficient.\nOkay?\nYou're burning less fuel\noverall doing the same thing.\nThat's really what\nthese long slow distance\nor long bouts of effort\nare really all about.\nNow, why do this long duration effort?\nWhy would you want to do it?\nWhy is it good for you?\nWell, it does something very important\nwhich is that it builds the\ncapillary beds within muscles.\nSo let's talk a little\nbit about vasculature.\nWe haven't done this too much yet,\nbut if you have seen the episode\non supercharging performance.\nWe talked about these AVAs\narteriovenous anastomosis\nwhere blood moves from\narteries directly into veins,\nbut that's unusual,\nthat only takes place in\nthe so-called glabrous skin\nof the palms, the face and\nthe bottoms of the feet.\nTypically, for most all\nother areas of the body\nwhat happens is,\narteries bring blood to a\ngiven tissue like a muscle,\nand veins return that\nblood back to the heart.\nThere are exceptions, but in general.\nAnd in between arteries and\nveins are these little tiny\nwhat are called capillary\nbeds or microcapillaries.\nSo these are tiny little avenues,\nlike little tiny streams and estuaries\nbetween the bigger arteries and veins.\nNow, those are actually\ncontained within muscle.\nAnd what's amazing is\nthat you can increase\nthe number of them.\nYou can literally build new capillaries.\nYou can create new little\nstreams within your muscles\nand the type of long duration effort\nthat I was talking about\nbefore to 12 minutes or more\nof steady effort is very\nuseful for doing that,\nand is very useful for\nincreasing the mitochondria,\nthe energy producing\nelements of the cells,\nthe actual muscle cells.\nAnd the reason is when\nblood arrives to muscles\nit has oxygen.\nThe muscles are going to\nuse some of that oxygen.\nAnd then some of the deoxygenated blood\nis going to be sent back to\nthe heart and to the lungs.\nNow, the more capillaries that\nyou build into those muscles,\nthe more oxygen available\nto those muscles.\nI don't want to get too much\ninto the physics of fluid flow.\nBut basically it's the\ndifference between taking a hose\nand sticking it into some\ndirt just directly like\nand turning on the faucet at a given rate,\nthe spigot rather,\nor having a bunch of little hoses\nlike a sprinkler system that go out\nand irrigate the whole yard.\nThe irrigation is equivalent\nto this capillary bed system.\nAnd it's very good at using\nenergy sources within blood.\nSo the simple way to think about this is,\nwhen you go out for a run,\nlet's say it's the first\nrun you've done for a while,\nand you out for 12 or 15 minutes\nand somewhere right around 20 minutes\nyou're like, that's it.\nI just can't continue.\nWell, when you come back the\nnext time to do that run,\nyou've built endurance largely\nbecause you've built these capillary beds.\nYou've expanded these little streams\nin which blood can deliver\noxygen to the muscles.\nAnd so it's going to feel\nrelatively straightforward\nto either go a little bit\nquicker for the same duration,\nthe same distance.\nOr to extend that run for\nanother five to 10 minutes.\nSo this long duration work,\nunlike muscular endurance like planks\nand everything that we\nwere talking about before\nis really about building\nthe capillary systems\nand the mitochondria,\nthe energy utilization systems\nwithin the muscles themselves.\nAnd that's very important to understand.\nIt's distinctly different\nthan say building the neurons\nthat fire the muscles.\nThe neurons are already there,\nthey're going to fire\nthose muscles just fine.\nIn fact, if your life depended on it,\ntoday you could probably run a marathon.\nYou'd probably get injured,\nit would be very psychologically\nand physically painful.\nI don't recommend you do that\nunless you're trained for it.\nBut if you were to train properly for it,\nif you were to do long\nduration bouts of effort\nonce or twice a week or three times a week\npretty soon it would become easy,\nbecause you're building\nthese vascular micro beds\nor microvascular beds as they're called.\nOkay?\nSo you're able to bring\nmore energy to the muscles\nand they're able to utilize more energy.\nSo that's long duration.\nSo we've got muscular endurance\nand we've got long duration endurance.\nAnd then there are two kinds in between\nthat in recent years have\ngotten a lot of attention\nand excitement,\nbut most people are not distinguishing\nbetween these two kinds of endurance.\nAnd that's a shame because\nin failing to distinguish\nbetween the two kinds of what we call\nhigh-intensity training,\nsometimes called high\nintensity interval training.\nMost people, perhaps you,\nare not getting nearly as much physical\nand mental benefit out of\nhigh intensity training\nas you could.\nSo I want to talk about the two kinds\nof high-intensity interval training,\nand what each of them does\nfor your brain and body,\nand what sorts of adaptations they cause?\nBecause in doing that,\nyou can really start to build\nup specific energy systems\nin your brain and body in\nways that are best serve you\nfor your cognitive work.\nAnd for other sorts of things\nlike strength and speed\nor hypertrophy or for running\nmarathons for that matter.\nSo there are two kinds of\nhigh intensity training\nfor endurance.\nSometimes called high-intensity\ninterval training.\nOne, is anaerobic, so-called\nan aerobic endurance,\nso no oxygen.\nAnd the other is aerobic endurance.\nBoth of which qualify as HIIT,\nhigh intensity interval training.\nSo let's talk about\nanaerobic endurance first.\nAnaerobic endurance from\na protocol perspective\nis going to be three to 12 sets.\nOkay?\nAnd these records and I'll talk about\nwhat the repetitions are,\nare going to be performed\nat whatever speed allows you\nto complete the work in good, safe form.\nOkay?\nSo it could be fast, it could be slow\nas the work continues,\nyour repetitions may slow down,\nor it may speed up.\nChances are it's going to slow down.\nSo what does this work?\nWhat are the sets look like?\nRemember long slow distance is one set.\nMuscular endurance is three to five sets.\nHigh-intensity anaerobic endurance\nis going to be somewhere\nbetween three and 12 sets.\nAnd it's going to have\na ratio of work to rest\nof anywhere from three\nto one to one to five.\nOkay?\nSo what would a three to\none ratio set look like?\nWell, it's going to be 30\nseconds of hard pedaling\non the bike, for instance,\nor running or on the rower.\nThese are just examples.\nIt could be in the pool, swimming.\nIt could be any number\nof things or air squats,\nor weighted squats if you will\nprovided you can manage that.\n30 seconds on, 10 seconds off.\nThat's a very brief rest.\nSo three to one is just a good example\nwould be 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.\nThe opposite extreme on\nthat ratio be one to five.\nSo 20 seconds on a hundred seconds off.\nSo you do the work for 20 seconds\nthen you rest a hundred seconds.\nNow, what's the difference?\nWhat should you do three one ratio?\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,\nor should you do one to five,\n20 seconds on to 100 seconds off?\nWell, that will depend on\nwhether or not the quality\nof the movement is important to you.\nSo let's just take a look\nat the three to one ratio.\nSo in the three to one ratio,\nif you're going to do 30\nseconds of hard peddling\non a bike followed by 10 seconds.\nSo maybe one of these what\nthey call assault bikes,\nand then you stop for 10\nseconds and then repeat,\nchances are you will\nbe able to do one, two,\nthree, four, maybe even\nas many as 12 sets,\nif you're really in good condition\nthat you'll be able to do all those\nbecause pedaling on the bike\ndoesn't require a ton of skill.\nAnd if you do it incorrectly,\nif your elbow flares out\na little bit or something,\nit's very unlikely that you'll get injured\nunless it's really extreme.\nOkay?\nBut the same movement done for\ninstance, with kettlebells.\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off.\nThe first set will\nprobably be in good form.\nThe second one will be\nin pretty good form,\nbut let's say you're getting\nto the fifth and sixth set\nand you're going 30\nseconds on 10 seconds off\nchances are the quality\nof your repetitions\nwill degrade significantly.\nAnd you increase the probability\nthat you're going to get injured,\nor that you're going\nto damage in some way,\nor that you can't complete the movement\nor that some smaller muscles\nlike your grip muscles\nmight give out.\nOkay?\nSo the quality of repetitions\nis going to drop considerably\nwith the three to one approach.\nIf you're just doing it for effort.\nAnd we'll talk about what\nthis builds in your system\nin a moment, that's fine.\nBut for most people, if\nquality of form is important,\nso maybe this is using weights,\nmaybe you're doing squats.\nYou're going to do 20 seconds\non and 100 seconds of rest.\nMaybe it's even a barbell loaded squat,\nmaybe you're doing kettlebells,\nmaybe you've got some\nother resistance there\nthat's allowing you to do this.\nWhat you'll find is that the longer rest,\neven though it's 20\nseconds of intense effort,\nfollowed by a longer rest\nof about a hundred seconds\nwill allow you to perform\nmore quality repetitions\nsafely over time.\nSo what does building\nanaerobic endurance look like?\nAnd then I'll tell you what\nit's actually good for,\nin the true practical sense.\nWhat anaerobic endurance\nexercise generally looks like\nis that if you decide to\ndo this for the first week,\nyou might do this two\nor three times a week,\nmaybe even just once a week,\ndepending on the other\nthings you're doing,\nwe'll talk about programming at the end.\nAnd you would generate just three sets.\nSo it might be three sets of\n20 seconds of hard effort,\nfollowed by 100 seconds rest.\nThen you repeat 20 seconds of hard effort,\n100 seconds rest, 20 seconds\nof effort, 100 seconds rest,\nand you might do that twice a week.\nAnd then each week you're\nadding one or two sets, okay?\nIn doing that, you will\nbuild up what we call\nanaerobic endurance.\nWhat is anaerobic endurance?\nWell, let's ask why we fail?\nAnaerobic endurance is going\nto be taking your system\ninto greater than 100% of your VO2 max.\nIt's going to be taking\nyour heart rate up very high\nand it's going to maximize your\noxygen utilization systems.\nThat is going to have effects\nthat are going to lead\nto fatigue at some point\nin the workout.\nAnd that fatigue will\ntrigger an adaptation.\nSo let's ask what\nadaptation it's triggering.\nWell, it's triggering both\nmitochondrial respiration,\nthe ability of your mitochondria\nto generate more energy\nby using more oxygen because\nyou're bringing so...\nYou're maxing out,\nliterally you're getting\nabove your VO2 max.\nYou're hitting that\nthreshold of how much oxygen\nyou can use in your system?\nOne of the adaptations will\nbe that your mitochondria\nwill shift such that\nthey can use more oxygen.\nAnd you're going to also\nincrease the capillary beds,\nbut not as much as you're going to be able\nto increase the amount of\nneuron engagement of muscle.\nSo normally when we start to hit fatigue,\nwhen we're exhausted,\nwhen we're breathing really hard\nbecause the systems of the body are linked\nand we there's a\ncomponent to this as well,\na kind of motivational component.\nAfter that third or\nfourth or sixth set of,\nyou know, 20 seconds on\na hundred seconds off,\nor if you're at the other\nextreme 30 seconds on,\nand 10 seconds off.\nThere's going to be a\ncomponent of you want to stop.\nAnd by pushing through and\nrepeating another set safely,\nof course.\nWhat you're doing is\nyou're training the neurons\nto be able to access\nmore energy, literally,\nconvert that into ATP and for the muscles\ntherefore to access more energy and ATP.\nAnd the adaptation is in\nthe mitochondria's ability\nto use oxygen,\nand this has tremendous carry over effects\nfor other types of exercise.\nSo while I know and appreciate\nthat people are using high\nintensity interval training\nof this kind or similar in\norder to just like burn fat,\nyou know, do their\nworkouts, quote unquote.\nIt's very useful for\nbuilding a capacity to engage\nin short bouts of effort\nrepeatedly to really lock in.\nI don't want to use the word focus\nbecause it's not strictly mental focus,\nbut to be able to generate\nshort bouts of very intense work\nthis can be beneficial\nin competitive sports\nor team sports where there's\na sprinting component,\nwhere the field opens up\nand you need to dribble\nthe ball down the field, for\ninstance and shoot on goal.\nOr where you're playing tennis,\nand it's a long rally.\nAnd then all of a sudden,\nsomebody really starts,\nyou know, putting you back on your heels\nand you have to really make\nthe maximum amount of effort\nto run to the net and to\nget the ball across in that.\nThings of that sort.\nOkay?\nThere are a variety of places\nwhere there's carry over\nfrom this type of training,\nbut it does support endurance.\nIt's about muscle endurance.\nIt's about these muscles ability\nto generate a lot of force\nin the short-term, but repeatedly.\nOkay?\nSo that's the way to conceptualize this.\nAnd it is different than maximum power.\nEven though it feels like maximum effort,\nit is not the same as building\npower and speed into muscles.\nThose are distinctly different protocols.\nSo the key elements again\nare that you're bringing your breathing\nand your oxygen utilization\nway up above your max.\nIt's not quite hitting failure,\nbut you're really pushing the system\nto the point where you are\nnot ready to do another set\nand yet you begin another set.\nYou're not necessarily\npsychologically ready.\nI'll talk more about\nsome of the adaptations\nthat this causes in terms of\nstroke volume in a few minutes\nwhen we talk about how it\nis that work of this sort\ncan increase our heart's ability\nto deliver blood and oxygen\nto our lungs and other tissues.\nI'm going to get very\nspecific about how to breathe\nduring these different types of protocols\nand what's happening at\nthe level of the heart?\nBut I want to make sure I\ntouch on the fourth protocol\nwhich is high intensity\naerobic conditioning.\nSo HIIT has these two forms,\nanaerobic and aerobic.\nAnd you just heard about anaerobic.\nHigh-intensity aerobic conditioning\nalso involves about three to 12 sets.\nStarting off of course, with fewer sets\nas you're getting into this training\nand then extending into more sets\nas one parameter you could expand.\nHas again the same ratio of three to one.\nSo 30 seconds on 10 seconds off,\nor one to five, 20 seconds\non 100 seconds off,\nor a very powerful tool for\nbuilding up aerobic conditioning\nis a one-to-one ratio.\nA one-to-one ratio is powerful\nfor building on average.\nMost of the energy systems involving,\nremember we had these nerve\nmuscle blood, heart and lungs.\nA one-to-one ratio\nmight be you run a mile.\nAnd however long that takes,\nlet's say it takes you six\nminutes or seven minutes,\nthen you rest for an\nequivalent amount of time.\nThen you repeat.\nAnd then you rest for an\nequivalent amount of time.\nSo you might run first mile\nis let's say seven minutes.\nThen you rest for seven minutes.\nThen you run a mile again,\nand it might take eight minutes\nand you rest for eight minutes.\nAnd you continue that for a\ntotal of four miles of work.\nFour miles of running work, I should say.\nOr seven miles of work.\nYou can build this up.\nMany people find that\nusing this type of training\nallows them to do things\nlike go run half marathons\nand marathons even though\nprior to the race date,\nthey've never actually run\na half marathon or marathon.\nNow, that might seem incredible.\nIt's like how could it be\nthat running a mile on,\nand then resting for running a mile\nand then resting for an\nequivalent amount of time,\nrunning a mile, resting\nfor equivalent amount time\nfor seven miles allows\nyou to run continuously\nfor 13 miles or for 26 miles.\nWell, I'm not discouraging people\nfrom ever doing the\nlong duration endurance.\nI think that is very important.\nBut it's because it builds\nup so many of these energy\nutilization systems.\nIt really teaches you\nto engage, excuse me,\nthe nerve to muscle firing.\nIt improves ATP and\nmitochondrial function in muscle.\nIt allows the blood to deliver more oxygen\nto the muscle and to your brain.\nAnd I'll explain how that is.\nAnd it allows your heart to\ndeliver more oxygen overall.\nAnd it builds a tremendous lung capacity.\nAnd we will talk about\nexactly how to breathe\nand how to build lung capacity.\nBoth for sake of warming\nup and for performance.\nSo what would this look like?\nAnd when should you do this?\nWell, it's really a\nquestion for these workouts\nof asking how much work can\none do in eight to 12 minutes,\nright?\nAnd then rest, and then repeat.\nHow much work can you do\nfor eight to 12 minutes\nthen rest and then repeat?\nAnd how many times should you do this?\nWell, this is the sort of\nthing it's pretty intense.\nAnd so you would probably\nonly want to do this two,\nmaybe three times a week\nif you're not doing many other things.\nI will talk about how this program\ncan be moved in with\nother forms of training.\nBut I'll just give you a little hint now.\nIt's very clear and it's\ndescribed in the review article\nare referred to and we will\nlink another article as well.\nThat concurrent training,\ndoing strength training\nand the endurance training\nof any of the four kinds\nthat I'm describing today can be done.\nYou can program those in the same week.\nBut you want to get four and ideally six\nor even better 24 hours\nbetween these workouts.\nBecause it is very hard, for instance,\nto do a one-to-one mile repeats\nlike run a mile rest for equivalent time,\nrun a mile rest for equivalent time\nto do that two or three times a week,\nand also do weight training before\nor do a long run afterwards.\nThat would quickly lead to\nbreak down for most people,\nunless you have very, very good\nenergy utilization systems.\nYou're really kind of\nadvanced or elite athlete,\nand or dare I say you're using tools\nto enhance your performance\nat the level of blood\nor hormones.\nAnd I'm actually going to\ntalk about those at the end\nand why they work?\nSo we have four kinds of endurance.\nMuscular endurance.\nWe have long-duration endurance.\nWe have high intensity\ninterval training of two kinds,\nanaerobic and aerobic.\nAnd this last type, the\naerobic one works best.\nIt seems if you kind of\ndo this one-to-one ratio.\nSo how would you use these and\nwhat are they actually doing?\nLet's talk about the heart\nand the lungs and oxygen,\nbecause that's something\nthat we can all benefit\nfrom understanding.\nAnd it will become very\nclear in that discussion\nwhy this type of training is very useful\neven for non-athletes in\norder to improve oxygenation\nand energy utilization of\nthe brain and the heart.\nThe brain and the heart are probably\nthe two most important systems\nthat you need to take\ncare of in your life.\nYes, your musculature\nneeds to be maintained.\nIf you want to build it, that's up to you.\nBut you should try and\nmaintain your musculature,\nbut maintaining or\nenhancing a brain function\nand cardiovascular function.\nIt's absolutely clear are\nkey for health and longevity\nin the short and long-term.\nAnd the sorts of training\nI talked about today\nhas been shown again and again and again\nto be very useful for enhancing\nthe strength of the mind.\nYes, I'll talk about that.\nAs well as the health of\nthe brain and the body.\nSo let's talk about the\nsorts of adaptations\nthat are happening in your brain and body\nthat are so beneficial in these\ndifferent forms of training.\nIf you are breathing hard and\nyour heart is beating hard.\nSo this would be certainly\nin the high intensity\nanaerobic and aerobic conditioning.\n'Cause you're getting up near your VO2 max\nin high intensity aerobic conditioning,\nand you're exceeding your\nVO2 max in high intensity\nanaerobic conditioning.\nWhat's going to happen is as of course,\nyour heart beats faster,\nyour blood is going to be\ncirculating faster in principle.\nOxygen utilization in\nmuscles is going to go up\nand over time, not long,\nvery quickly what will happen\nwhen those capillary beds start to expand?\nWe talked about that.\nBut in addition, because\nof the amount of blood\nthat's being returned to the heart,\nwhen you engage in these\nreally intense bouts\nof effort repeatedly,\nthe amount of blood being\nreturned to the heart\nactually causes an east centric loading\nof one of the muscular walls of the heart.\nSo your heart is muscle.\nIt's cardiac muscle.\nWe have skeletal muscle\nattached to our bones\nand we have cardiac\nmuscle, which is our heart.\nWhen more blood is being\nreturned to the heart\nbecause of the additional\nwork that your muscles\nand nerves are doing,\nit actually has the effect of creating\nan east centric loading, a\nkind of pushing of the wall,\nthe left wall.\nI realize I'm not using\nthe strict anatomy here,\nbut I don't want to get\ninto all the features\nof the structural features of the heart.\nBut the left ventricle\nessentially getting slammed back\nand then having to push back\nin a kind of east centric\nloading of the cardiac muscle\nand the muscle thickens,\nbut not because the\nheart thickens overall,\nit's actually a strengthening\nof the cardiac muscle\nin a way that increases\nwhat we call stroke volume.\nMeaning as more blood is\nreturned to the heart.\nThere's an adaptation\nwhere the heart muscle\nactually gets stronger and\ntherefore can pump more blood\nper stroke per beat.\nAnd as it does that, it delivers\nbecause blood contains glucose\nand oxygen and other things.\nIt delivers more fuel to your muscles\nwhich allows you to do yet\nmore work per unit time.\nOkay?\nSo when we hear that,\noh, you know, so-and-so\nhas a or maybe you have\na nice low heart rate\nthat maybe you're one of\nthese really extreme folks\nlike 30 or 40 beats per minute,\nalthough most people are\nsitting at 50, 60, 70, 80,\nthat's your resting heart rate.\nIf you exercise regularly\nand you do long duration aerobic work,\nyour heart rate will start to go down,\nyour resting heart rate.\nIt will increase the stroke\nvolume of your heart.\nIf you do this high\nintensity type training\nwhere your heart is beating very hard.\nSo maybe the one-to-one\nratio mile run repeats\nthat I described a minute ago.\nLet's say you do that twice\na week for three or four.\nAnd I said, it could go all\nthe way up to 12 rep sets,\nwhich is a lot.\nI don't recommend people start there.\nPretty soon, the stroke\nvolume of your heart\nwill really increase.\nAnd as a consequence,\nyou can deliver more fuel\nto your muscles and to your brain,\nand you will notice that\nyou can do more work\nmeaning you can do the same\nwork you were doing a few days\nor weeks ago with relative ease.\nYour cognitive functioning will improve.\nThis has been shown again and again,\nbecause there's an\nincrease in vasculature.\nLiterally, capillary\nbeds within the brain,\nthe hippocampus areas that support memory,\nbut also areas of the brain\nthat support respiration,\nthat support focus,\nthat support effort.\nThis isn't often discussed,\nbut the ability to deliver more blood\nand therefore more glucose,\nremember neurons run on\nglucose and oxygen to the brain\nis a big feature of why\nexercise of the kind\nof describing helps with brain function.\nNow, weight training does\nhave some positive effects\non brain function also.\nWhen I say weight training, I'm really...\nI should be more specific.\nI really am referring to strength\nand hypertrophy training.\nStrength and hypertrophy training\nespecially if it's of the sort\nwhere you get into the burn\nas we talked about last episode\nand you start generating\nlactate as a hormonal signal\nthat can benefit your brain, et cetera.\nIt can have positive effects on the brain.\nAnd frankly, there haven't\nbeen as many studies\nof resistance training strength\nand hypertrophy training\non brain function,\nmainly because most of those experiments\nare done in mice or\nprimates, non-human primates,\nI should say.\nAnd it's hard to get mice\nto do resistance training.\nOkay?\nIt's hard to get humans\nto do resistance training.\nIt's definitely hard to get\nmice to do resistance training.\nThere are ways to do it,\nbut it's hard to get\nthem to do say, you know,\nthree sets of eight on the\ndeadlift and then do some curls\nand then do some chin-ups\nand this kind of thing.\nOkay?\nIt's pretty easy to get a\nmouse to run on a treadmill\nand you can set the\ntension on that treadmill\nto make it so that it's\neasier or harder for the mouse\nto turn that wheel.\nSo that's one of the reasons.\nHowever, it's very clear\nand you should now understand intuitively\nwhy the kind of standard\nstrength and hypertrophy\ntype workouts are not going to activate\nthe blood oxygenation and\nthe stroke volume increases\nfor the heart that the sorts of training\nI'm talking about today will.\nIt just doesn't have the\nsame positive effects.\nNow, that isn't to say that\nif you just weight train\nthat you'll be dumb or that\nyou'll lose your memory\nover time, you might,\nbut it is to say that endurance work\nin particular the high intensity\nand long duration work that\nI've talked about today.\nThe two high intensity protocols\nand the long duration work has been shown\nagain and again and again,\nto have positive effects\non brain function.\nNot through the addition of new neurons,\nsorry to break it to you,\nbut that's not a major\nevent in the exercised\nor non-exercised human brain,\nfor reasons we can talk\nabout in a future episode.\nBut it still has many positive effects\nthrough the delivery of things like IGF-1,\nbut also just through plain\noxygenation of the brain\nand the way it promotes the\ndevelopment of microvasculature\nto develop, to excuse me,\nto deliver new neurons more nutrients.\nIf neurons don't get oxygen\nand glucose, they do die.\nUnless there's another\nfuel source like ketones\nwhich can replace the glucose.\nIf you don't give oxygen to neurons,\nif you don't deliver enough to them,\nyou get what's called ischemia,\nyou get little micro strokes.\nSo the type of exercise\nI'm talking about today\nin generating intense heart rate increases\nprovided that safe for you to do.\nBreathing hard,\nthat's going to deliver oxygen in blood,\nincrease stroke volume of the heart\nand is going to improve brain function\nhas been supported by many, many quality\npeer-reviewed studies.\nSo that's one form of positive adaptation.\nI also talked about just sort\nof performance adaptations.\nHow doing high intensity\naerobic conditioning\nof the mile repeats type\ntraining can actually\nimprove your ability to do\nlong bouts of intense work.\nIt also seems like it dovetails\nor is compatible with resistance training\nthat's aimed towards\nstrength and hypertrophy.\nNow, in full disclosure\nthe data seemed to indicate\nthat if people just weight\ntrain or train for strength,\nso three reps, rest five minutes,\nthree reps of heavyweights, et cetera.\nYeah, you'll get much\nstronger than you would\nif you're doing things like\nfive repetitions up to 12,\nor 12 to 25 reps and you're\ngoing out for long jogs.\nThere's always going to be\na compromise in adaptations,\nunfortunately\nIt does seem like you can\ndo concurrent training\nas I mentioned before,\nif you allow anywhere\nfrom four to six or ideally\n24 hours between workouts.\nAs I mentioned in the previous episode,\nif you want to know if you\nare recovered from a workout?\nA great way to do that is to apply\nthe carbon dioxide tolerance test,\nwhich is four breaths in and out,\ninhale, exhale, inhale exhale,\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,\nthen a big inhale and then\na slow controlled exhale.\nIf that slow controlled exhale\nis 60 seconds or longer,\nit means that your parasympathetic,\nyour calming nervous system\nis under your control.\nAnd it's likely, I should say likely\nthat systemically your whole\nnervous system has recovered\nfrom whatever it is that you've been doing\nand experiencing in life\nincluding work in relationships.\nIf not, you might want to\ntake a rest day, dare I say.\nOr Costello's on is what?\nHe's 10 now.\nI think he's on his 12,000 thrust day.\nMost people need I should say,\none to two full rest days per week.\nI know there are people going to say\nthat's ridiculous and okay,\nmaybe you have amazing recovery abilities,\nalso depends on training intensity.\nMany people benefit from having one or two\nfull rest days per week.\nAt least one, some people don't need to.\nBut if you are not able\nto extend that exhale\non the carbon dioxide tolerance\ntest past 60 seconds or so,\n45 seconds, 60 seconds chances are,\nyour so-called sympathetic nervous system,\nyour stress system is chronically elevated\nand you're not really putting the brake\non that system enough.\nAnd that's a subconscious thing.\nThere are ways that you\ncan accelerate recovery,\nbut I would encourage you to\nlisten to the previous episode.\nIt's time-stamped for\nhow to assess recovery.\nSo how often to program these things\nwill depend on the other\nthings you're doing.\nI think it's perfectly reasonable\nto do this type of training\nwith other types of training.\nAnd I'll talk about a variety\nof combinations of those\ntoward the end of the episode.\nI do want to talk about\nhow to deliver more energy\nand oxygen.\nThese are tools that are extremely useful,\nI believe and that are\ngrounded in physiology.\nThat three things I'd like to talk about,\nare how to breathe?\nWhat to do immediately after\ntraining and hydration?\nAnd I promise I will get\nback into programming\nand sort of protocols,\nbut these are vitally\nimportant to your ability\nto perform endurance work in particular.\nAnd they are grounded\nin how neurons and blood\nand oxygen and your heart work together.\nSo let's first talk about\nbreathing or respiration.\nWe breathe a couple of different ways,\nbut let's just remind\nourselves why we breathe?\nWe breathe to bring\noxygen into our system,\nand we breathe to get\nrid of carbon dioxide.\nAnd we need both oxygen and carbon dioxide\nin order to utilize fuel and\nfor our brain and body to work.\nIt's not the oxygen is good\nand carbon oxide is bad.\nThey have to be present\nin the appropriate ratios.\nSo one thing that is\nvery clear is our ability\nto deliver oxygen to working\nmuscles enter our brain\nis going to be important for our ability\nto generate muscular effort\nespecially of a kind of what\nI was talking about today,\nbut also weight training and other forms\nof skill-based effort, et cetera.\nAnd our ability to think.\nIf you're holding your\nbreath for too long,\nif you're breathing too much,\nif you're what they call\nover-breathing or under breathing,\nif you're shallow breathing,\nif you're mouth breathing,\nthese are all things that\ncan really impede mental\nand physical performance.\nSo let's make it really simple\nand then I promise to do a\nfuture episode all about recipes.\nThere are two main sources\nof air for your body\nand it's air coming in through your nose\nand air coming in through your mouth.\nIn general nasal breathing is better.\nIt scrubs the air of bacteria and viruses.\nYou have a microbiome in\nyour nose that benefits.\nThere are a number of reasons,\nit's also just a more efficient\nsystem believe it or not,\neven though it feels like\nyou can gulp more air\nwith your mouth.\nGetting good at nasal breathing is useful.\nA gear - System of the\ntype that Brian McKenzie\nand colleagues have developed,\nI think is a good way\nto conceptualize this.\nIf you're doing long duration work,\ntry and do it all nasal breathing.\nIf you have deviated septum,\nit's probably cause you\ndon't nasal breathe enough.\nMouth breathing is something\nthat many people suffer from.\nYou are more prone to infections.\nIt's not as efficient, et cetera.\nThere is a place for mouth breathing.\nHowever, it's usually, if you\nneed to do a strong exhale,\noftentimes you can discard\nmore volume through the mouth,\nunless you're very trained\nat nasal breathing.\nSo if you're doing high\nintensity training,\na good way to conceptualize\nthis is to exhale\non the max effort,\nand then to inhale on\nthe less intense part.\nSo that might be as you're\ngenerating the movement,\nyou know, you're in the\nconcentric part of the movement\nyou exhale, right?\nJust like on a bat swing\nor something like that,\nor fighters and martial artists\ndo this differently depending\non how they were trained\nand their different purposes,\nbut they kind of like huh or ssh,\nthey kind of exhaling during the effort\nand then inhaling on the\nportion of the repetition\nthat is not the highest effort portion.\nUsually that's the eccentric phase\nof anything involving or\nrowing and things of that sort.\nSo nasal breathing is great,\nbut as you increase the\nintensity of your endurance work,\nyou will need to incorporate the mouth.\nSo a gear system would look something\nlike first gear would\nbe just nasal breathing\nor second gear would also\nbe just nasal breathing.\nBut with more effort, third gear again,\npower speed endurance has\na lot more about this.\nYou can go to their website.\nI think it's a very intelligent\nway to conceptualize this.\nAs you go into more max effort,\nthen you're going to third\nand fourth and fifth gear.\nAnd at some point you're not\nthinking about nose or mouth.\nYou're just trying to\nhang on for dear life\nand complete the work safely.\nAnd that means breathe through\nwhatever orifice works for you.\nSo that's one aspect, nose versus mouth.\nThe other aspect is whether\nor not you're using your ribs,\nthe intercostal muscles are these muscles\nthat the Bruce Lee had these\nremarkable intercostal muscles\nthat allow you to lift the\nrib cage or the diaphragm\nwhich is a skeletal muscle\nthat sits below the lungs.\nJust to remind you, when you inhale,\nthe diaphragm moves down,\nwhen you exhale, the diaphragm moves up.\nOkay?\nHere's something that most people don't do\nand would benefit tremendously from.\nAnd I can say this\nbecause Andy Galpin's lab\nhas done work on this\nexploring how warming up\nthe intercostals and the\nnerve to diaphragm pathways\nbefore any kind of endurance work\nor in the first few\nminutes of endurance work\ncan allow you to breathe more deeply\nand to deliver more oxygen to the blood,\n[burps] excuse me,\nand to the muscles and to\nbe able to do more work\nmore efficiently.\nSo what that involves\nis sometimes sitting,\nsometimes standing and\njust really concentrating\non two things.\nWe always hear about how we\nshould diaphragmatic breathe.\nAnd that means that our belly\nmoves out when we inhale.\nSo [inhales deeply] our stomach expands,\nbut also expanding the intercostals\nwhich means actually raising\nthe ribs, chest breathing.\nWe're all told that in yoga class\ndon't breathe with your\nchest this, [inhales deeply].\nBut actually that is warming\nup the intercostal muscles.\nSo this is also a great\nway to generate adrenaline\nif you do it a little bit intensely.\nSo let's say you're feeling\nunmotivated to train,\nI don't particularly like\ndoing endurance training\nuntil I'm actually doing it.\nSo I use and benefit\nfrom having a practice\nwhere I'll just sit there\nand for about three minutes\nI'll just breathe very deeply\ntrying to raise my chest\nas much as I can for maybe a minute,\nand then contracting my diaphragm\nand expanding my stomach\noutward when I inhale.\nBy the end of that you're\nactually delivering more oxygen\nto your system.\nMy lab has looked at this in\na totally different context.\nAndy's lab has looked at it in the context\nof physical performance.\nSo warming up the breathing\nmuscles should make sense,\ngiven that you now know\nthat muscles and neurons\nneed glucose and they need\noxygen in order to function.\nAnd so that's a great warmup.\nYou can also do this while walking\nor while getting on the\nbike and starting to peddle,\nreally starting to think about warming up\nthe breathing system.\nAnd then you can decide if\nyou want to do pure nasal\nor a combination of nasal and\nmouth breathing and so on.\nSo that's something that\nwe don't often hear about.\nThe other one.\nThe other tool, rather that I talked about\nin a previous episode,\nI'll just mention again,\nis some people when they\ndo endurance type work\nthey get a stitch in their side.\nThey feel like they've got a side cramp.\nVery rarely is it actually\na skeletal muscular cramp,\nit's oftentimes it's a referenced\npain of the phrenic nerve\nthat innervates the liver.\nSo the phrenic nerve is responsible\nfor the movement of the diaphragm.\nIt is a very important system,\nbut it has a number of\nwhat we call collateral.\nSo it branches to other organs.\nRuns over other organs.\nSometimes when we're breathing shallow\nand we are in physical motion\nand we're engaging in physical effort,\nwe'll feel that side stitch.\nAnd we think, oh, I've got a\ncramp or maybe I'm dehydrated\nor maybe I need to run\nwith my hands over my head,\nexcuse me.\nTypically, you can\nrelieve that side cramp,\nwhich isn't a cramp at all.\nThat side stitch by doing\nthe double inhale, exhale,\nreally breathing deeply. [inhales deeply]\nAnd then sneaking a\nlittle bit more air in.\nThat's a double kind of firing\nor what we call volume of action potential\nsent from the phrenic\nnerve to the diaphragm,\nwhich will also activate that collateral,\nthat branch literally of the nerve\nthat innervates the liver.\nAnd then when you exhale,\nyou offload a bunch of carbon dioxide,\nbut if you repeat that a few times often,\nin fact, for me every time\nbut often what'll happen\nis that side stitch will\njust naturally disappear.\nJust means you're not breathing properly.\nYou're the phrenic\nnerve is firing in a way\nthat's kind of aggravating\nthat referenced pain.\nThere's nothing kind of voodoo\nor mysterious about this.\nIt just has to do with the\nway that the different nerves\ntravel in the body.\nSo as you set out on your run\nor maybe you're going to do\nsome muscular endurance work\nor high intensity work,\nwarming up the intercostals,\nwarming up the diaphragm is good.\nAnd there are exercises and there is work\nthat you can do to\nstrengthen the intercostals\nand to strengthen the diaphragm\nduring bouts of this kind of effort.\nAnd I would say that one of the ways\nthat you can do that best\nis by really focusing\non getting the maximum\ndiaphragmatic expansion\nand chest lifting.\nWhat we're all told now not to do,\nyou know, don't chest\nbreathe, belly breathe.\nThe intercostals are there for a reason\nand they are perfectly\ngood at filling your lungs.\nAnd they work best when they collaborate\nwith your diaphragm.\nBut when you are starting to fatigue\nto start to really inhale deeply\nand try and really expand those to deliver\nmore oxygen to your system.\nWhile we're talking about\ndelivering more oxygen\nto your system,\nI want to share with you a useful tool\nthat will now make total sense\nmechanistically why it works,\nwhich is oftentimes when\nwe are on a long run\nor in long duration bouts of effort.\nWe will hit the so-called wall, right?\nWe will bonk.\nI think they used to call it,\ndo they still call it that Costello?\nHe's asleep.\nWe bonk.\nWhere we just we think\nno, we can't continue.\nIt's a curious thing as to\nwhether or not that's neural\nor whether or not it's fuel-based,\nthere's certainly going\nto be a psychological\nor motivational component.\nBut one way that you can\nreveal this kind of extra gear,\nthe capacity to push on is\nby understanding the way\nthat different muscle fibers\nuse energy differently.\nRemember the fast-twitch\nphosphocreatine system\nand the slow twitch\nsystem that relies mainly\non lipids and glucose.\nOkay, well, even if you\ndon't remember all that,\nif you've been running\nsteadily for a long time\nand you're starting to fatigue\nand you feel like it's time to quit.\nYou may have not tapped into\nan alternative fuel source.\nOne thing that you can\ndo is you can actually\nincrease your speed.\nThis is also true of work\nwhere you're doing repetitions\nwith kettlebells or something.\nYou can start to increase your speed.\nSo run faster, pedal faster,\nrow faster, swim faster\nnot all out sprint.\nBut in doing that, you're\nshifting the the muscles\nand the nerves over towards\nutilizing a separate fuel source\nor a distinct fuel source.\nMaybe the phosphocreatine system\nif it's a quick about\nof intense acceleration,\nor maybe it's a combination\nof lipids and carbohydrates\nin your system that weren't\navailable to you prior.\nNow, of course, if you completely deplete\nyour liver glycogen,\nyou completely deplete everything,\nyou're only going to be\nrunning on stored fuel and fats\nand eventually you'll\nstart metabolizing protein,\nmuscles themselves.\nBut this is a kind of a\nunique way to realize that,\noh, you weren't out of energy at all,\nyou're just over-relying\non one fuel source.\nAnd this is the reason why,\nespecially elite athletes\nare starting to both rely\non carbohydrates.\nSo they're doing the whole carb depletion\nthen carb loading thing.\nThey're loading up their\nliver and their muscles\nwith plenty of glycogen\nby eating pastas and rice\nand stuff before races.\nBut they are also ingesting\nketones during races,\nduring long bouts of effort,\nbecause ketones can be\na quick form of energy.\nThere's no reason why\nyou can't use ketones\nif they are taking exogenous\nketones and carbohydrate.\nAnd in combination, remember\nthe body is accustomed\nto using multiple fuel sources,\nfatty acids, carbohydrates\nall these things.\nIt's only in the, you\nknow, of internet age\nthat we think in terms of,\noh, well you're either keto\nor you're burning sugar,\nor you're fat adapted\nor key or fat fasting\nor fast fasting or fat fatting.\nCostello woke up when I said fat fatting.\nI'm not talking about you Costello.\nSo the point is that your body\nis used to using multiple fuel sources.\nSo if you're kind of hitting that wall,\nsometimes accelerating can\nactually allow you to tap\ninto a new fuel source or\ncombination of fuel sources\njust based on the way\nthat muscles use fuel.\nSo that's another tool.\nThe other thing that's really\nimportant to think about\nin terms of endurance\ntype work is hydration.\nAnd I think hydration is\nimportant for all forms\nof physical work and\nexercise not just endurance.\nThe deal with hydration\nis that we've been taught\nabout hydration all wrong.\nBut let's remember what neurons work on?\nWhat do they use in order to fire?\nWell, they certainly need water, right?\nWe need water in our system, I should say.\nBut remember they use electrolytes,\nsodium and potassium to\ngenerate those action potentials\nto actually get neurons to contract,\nto be able, excuse me, muscles to contract\nand for our brain to function\nand to be able to think.\nTypically, we're going to lose anywhere\nfrom one to five pounds of\nwater per hour of exercise.\nAnd that's going to vary tremendously,\nit's going to vary on weather,\nit's going to vary on intensity,\nprobably more like five pounds,\nif it's hot day and you're\nexercising very intensely.\nSo about one to five pounds per hour.\nNow, you know how much you weigh.\nSo if you think about\nyour weight in pounds,\nonce you lose about one to 4%\nof your body weight in water,\nyou're going to experience\nabout a 20 to 30% reduction\nin work capacity.\nIn your ability to generate\neffort of any kind,\nstrength, endurance, et cetera.\nYou are also going to\nexperience a significant drop\nin your ability to think and\nperform mental operations.\nSo hydration is key.\nNow, many people have been told,\nwell, if you urinate\nand your urine is clear,\nwell, then you're hydrated enough.\nSometimes that's true.\nSometimes that's not true.\nAlso and this isn't a\ntopic I enjoyed discussing,\nbut a urine is a biological phenomenon.\nIt's actually filtered\nblood every once in a while\nand if there's a kid and\nit's a family friend,\nI'll say, \"Did you know that your pee\n\"is actually filtered blood?\"\nAnd they usually kind of go wide-eyed.\nBut then they go, \"Oh,\nthat's kind of cool.\"\nLike kids have this natural curiosity\nabout blood and pee and stuff.\nThat's not contaminated by\nour preconceived notions\nof those things being gross,\nbecause you're in being filtered blood\ncan give you some indication as to whether\nor not you're hydrated enough or not.\nAnd in order to really assess that,\nit's not going to be sufficient to urinate\ninto another volume of water and assess\nwhether or not your urine\nis very dark or very light.\nIt actually requires\nurinating into a small volume\nand saying, well, is it\ndarker or lighter than before?\nIt's not something you really\nwant to do most places.\nThe etiquette of most\ngyms and environments\nis not suitable for that.\nBut one of the things that you can just do\nis you configure,\nwell, I'm going to lose one to\nfive pounds of water per hour.\nYou can show up to exercise\nreasonably hydrated\nwith electrolytes.\nSo potassium, sodium and\nmagnesium are really key.\nYes, it's true, you can die\nfrom drinking too much water\nin particular because it forces you,\nif you drink too much water,\nyou excrete too many electrolytes\nand your brain will shut off.\nYou'll actually your heart\nwill stop functioning properly.\nSo you don't want to over\nconsume to the extreme either,\nbut there are a number of equations\nthat go into figuring out\nhow much water you need\nbased on how intense\nyour training, et cetera,\nbody size, et cetera.\nJust remember you burn,\nyou lose, excuse me\nabout one to five pounds\nof water per hour,\ndepending on how hot it is,\nand how intensely you're exercising.\nOnce your body weight drops by one to 4%.\nSo you can just figure,\nwell, if you lose five pounds per hour,\nyou exercise for two hours.\nLet's say you're about 200 pounds,\nthat's about 10%.\nOkay?\nWell, you want to replace that\nbefore you very quickly or not.\nYou want to replace that all along\nbefore you start experiencing\nthis massive 20 to 30% reduction\nin work capacity of muscles\nand the brain.\nA simple formula.\nWhat I call it, the Galpin equation.\nHereafter, referred to\nas the Galpin equation\nis a formula that gets you\nclose to the exact amount\nthat you would want that Dr.\nAndy Galpin came up with,\nwhich is your body weight in pounds\ndivided by the number 30.\nAnd that is how many\nounces you should drink\nfor every 15 minutes of exercise.\nSo once again, the Galpin equation.\nYour body weight in pounds divided by 30.\nThat's the amount of fluid\nto drink in ounces, right?\nEvery 15 minutes of exercise.\nNow, if you are sweating a lot,\nyou may need more.\nOkay?\nIf you're already very well hydrated,\nyou may need less,\nbut that's a good rule of thumb to begin\nand to start to understand\nthe relationship\nbetween hydration and performance.\nThere is a phenomenon in\nwhich gastric emptying,\nthe ability to move stuff out of your gut,\nincluding water and\nelectrolytes out of your gut\nand into the bloodstream and for delivery\nto the tissues of your body for effort\nis hindered when you get\nabove 70% of your VO2 max.\nIn other words when you're\ndoing high intensity training\nsometimes people experience\nthat ingesting water\nduring intense training is difficult.\nIt is something that can\nbe actually trained up.\nIt's a matter of learning to kind of relax\nyour abdominal muscles.\nAnd there's some other\naspects of adaptation\nthat will allow you to drink\nduring higher intensity work.\nAs Galpin says, don't\ntry and ingest fluids\nwhen you're working out or competing\nat higher than 70% of VO2 max\nif you've never done it before.\nYou want to train up this capacity.\nPeople can learn how to\nconsume fluids during a race\nor consume fluids during bouts of exercise\nthat are very intense.\nAnd a lot of people don't want to do that,\n'cause they don't want to have\nto stop to urinate, et cetera.\nBut given the crucial role of hydration\nfor muscular performance\nand for brain performance,\nit seems that if you're\ngoing to be doing a lot\nof high intensity interval training\nof the various concepts talked about today\nor high intensity training of any kind\nthat hydration is key and learning\nor in other words, getting\nyour system to adapt\nto ingesting fluids in the\nmiddle of these workouts\nis something that seems beneficial.\nAt least to me, in terms of the trade off\nbetween being dehydrated\nand the somewhat discomfort\nof maybe drinking some fluids.\nSo you sip small amounts\nof fluid initially\nand then you're able to\ntake bigger and bigger gulps\nas time goes on.\nAnd pretty soon you're able\nto drink mid-set or be,\nexcuse me, not mid-set.\nPlease don't do that between\nsets and your workout\nor while you're still breathing\nhard after a mile repeat\nor something of that sort\nwithout much disruption\nor any at all to your performance.\nLast episode we talked\nabout how to assess recovery\nand things that you might want\nto do to improve recovery,\nhow exposure to ice baths\nand cold showers can reduce inflammation\nwhich can be great for recovery,\nbut can inhibit some of the adaptations\nfor strength and hypertrophy.\nBecause inflammation isn't good or bad.\nInflammation isn't like a\nnice person or a mean person.\nIt's both.\nIt's a great thing for\nstimulating adaptations,\nbut you don't want it around too long.\nAnd so we suggested that\nyou not do ice baths\nwithin probably six hours of any training\nwhere the goal was hypertrophy\nor strength training.\nThere is some evidence\nthat getting yourself\ninto an ice bath or cold\nshower after endurance training\ncan actually improve the\nmitochondrial aspects\nof endurance exercise that\nyou can get improvements\nin mitochondrial density,\nand you can get improvements\nin mitochondrial respiration\nby doing that afterwards\nand that it can facilitate recovery.\nThat's still a bit of\na controversial area.\nI do think that what I mentioned earlier\nthat waiting at least six hours\nand probably more like\n24 hours between workouts\nis a good idea.\nThat getting at least one\nfull day of rest each week,\nfor some people that'll be two.\nI have to say I'm one of these people\nthat after two days of\nabsolutely no exercise,\nI do perform better\nconsistently across all aspects\nof physical performance and\nmentally I feel better as well\neven though I load to take those days off\nunless I'm really exhausted\nit does seem to help my training.\nSome people can train seven\ndays a week and they're fine.\nI think it just is there's a\nlot of individual variation.\nYou want to work on sleep\nand maximizing sleep\nfor recovery nutrition,\nof course, as well.\nI talked about sleep in\nthe first four episodes\nof the podcast.\nIf you have trouble with sleep\ndefinitely check out those episodes.\nIt's very clear and a\nnumber of sports teams\neven some folks that I work with,\nand Andy Galpin and others\nare starting to incorporate\na what's called a\nparasympathetic down-regulation\nafter training of any kind as\na way to accelerate recovery\nand enable you to do more work.\nIn other words, get\nback to work out sooner.\nWhat is parasympathetic downregulation?\nIt means finishing your training\nand instead of just hopping on the phone\nor hopping into your car\nand heading off to take\nfive minutes minimum,\nmaybe ideally more like 10 or 20,\nbut for sake of time five minutes minimum\nand doing just some slow pure\nnasal long exhale breathing\nor lying down and just kind of zoning out.\nThat it seems can accelerate recovery\nand allow you to get back\ninto other types of work,\nmental work or physical work more quickly\nwhich makes total sense because\nremember your nervous system\nand recovery and work\nis a local phenomenon\nwhich muscles were you using.\nYou know, were you using your glutes,\nyour hams and your back\nor were using your shoulders, et cetera.\nBut it's also a systemic thing.\nIt's also about those neurons\nin the locus coeruleus that\nare releasing epinephrine\nand you want to quiet all\nthat down after training.\nYou want to really just zone out.\nThink Costello, channel\nyour inner Costello,\nand just mellow out for five to 20 minutes\nand then move into the rest of your day.\nFive minutes should be manageable.\nEven if it's just sitting in\nthe car with your eyes closed\ndoing that downregulation breathing.\nI think you'll see big benefits in terms\nof allowing yourself to come back sooner,\ndo more work over time\nand just perform and\nfeel better generally,\nas well as be able to\nthink about other things\nbesides the just how\nmuch the previous workout\nkind of beat you up.\nA couple more things I think\nare going to be useful.\nAnd I do want to just pack these in,\n'cause we are closing out the\nmonth on physical performance.\nAnd that's about\nprogramming and about pacing\nand the kind of mental\naspects of endurance.\nSo let's start with pacing and\nmental aspects of endurance.\nI learned from a friend and\ncolleague here at the podcast\nthat...\nWho's very active in triathlon\nand marathon and other...\nKnows a lot about that whole world\nand the competitive landscape there,\nthat pacing and literally physical pacers\nhave a laser on the ground\nor visualizing or having a\npace car or a pace runner\nin front is actually not\nallowed in many competitions.\nAnd if those are present\ndoesn't allow the race times\nto qualify as legitimate\nrecord holding times.\nAnd that's very interesting to me\nbecause what we know is\nthat the visual system\nhas this capacity to switch\nback and forth between\nwhat we call panoramic vision\nwhere we're not really\nfocused on anything.\nThings are just flowing past us\nor our eyes are just kind of zoned out.\nSo I can do this right now\nand you won't be able to tell\nbut I'm looking at the\ncorners of the room.\nI see Costello down there on the floor.\nI see my podcast team here\nand I can also see the microphone.\nI can see myself in this environment.\nThat's panoramic vision.\nWhereas if I draw my eyes to one location\nlike right there in the\ncenter of the camera,\nit's what's called a\nvergence eye movement.\nSo I'm contracting my visual window.\nThe contraction of the visual\nwindow when that's done,\nis the same thing that would happen\nif I was tracking say a\npace car or a pace runner\nor a laser on the ground.\nThe mere bringing our eyes together\nto what we call a vergence\npoint has the impact\nof triggering the activation\nof neural circuits\nin the thalamus.\nThings like zona incerta,\nif you really want to\nknow what their names are,\nof these brain areas.\nAs well as in the brainstem that activate\nthe so-called alertness system,\nthings like locus coeruleus,\nwhereas panoramic vision tends to bring us\ninto states of relaxation.\nYou can actually leverage\nus during your runs.\nLet's say you're out for a long run\nor you're swimming or you're cycling.\nThis is probably easiest\nto imagine out of the water\nbefore I do in the water as well.\nIf you focus your attention on a landmark\nthat you're going to run to,\nyou'll find that it's much easier\nthan if you don't actually\nhave a set milestone\nor landmark that you're going to run to.\nHowever, if you were to\ncontinue that repeatedly\njust going milestone after\nmilestone, after milestone,\nyou would feel more mentally fatigued\nand you would actually be able\nto degenerate less work overall.\nOne thing that can be useful\nis focusing on a milestone,\nrunning to that milestone or biking\nwhatever it is the activity happens to be,\nand then dilating your field of view\nto relax the system and\nthen continuing again.\nSo it's this kind of active contraction\nor of the visual window and then dilation\nof the visual window.\nContraction of the visual\nwindow allows you to generate\nmore effort but there's\na cost to doing that,\nbecause neurons consume energy.\nAnd now you know how they do that.\nWhereas dilation allows you to essentially\nbe more efficient, right?\nNow, pacing is not allowed or\nhaving a pacer, a visual pacer\nbecause it does allow\nyou to access systems\nin the brain and body that\nallow you to create more energy,\nmore effort.\nAnd so I find it interesting\nthat I think in a kind\nof subconscious genius\nthe race officials and\nthe governing bodies\nof these races have said,\nokay, sure, having a pacer\nthere or someone in front,\nyou can draft off of them,\nthere's actually a kind\nof a aerodynamic effect\nof having someone in front of you\nthat makes it easier to run in\nthe wake of their airstream.\nSo to speak.\nSame as true in cycling.\nThis is why the cycling teams are so good\nat maneuvering and packs.\nIn very specific ways, you\ncan go faster with less effort\nif you're drafting as it's\ncalled behind somebody.\nBut as well where you place\nyour vision will allow you\nto generate more effort.\nAnd so it's interesting\nthat they've taken out\nthis kind of, if you will,\nperformance enhancing tool.\nI imagine and I have to imagine\nit's the appropriate word here.\nThat good runners, good\ncyclists have the ability\nto create a kind of\npacer in their minds eye.\nI have to imagine that they're\nnot just completely allowing\ntheir attention to drift,\nalthough they do that when they\nwant to be in highly efficient\nmode generating effort\nwithout having to tax\ntheir mental capacity.\nAnd remember mental\ncapacity is neural energy\nand consumes glucose energy\nthat they could devote\nto the functioning of their body.\nBut that when needed that they\ncan focus their energy in,\nand actually kind of chase a\nmental pacer or pick milestone.\nSo this is a mental game\nthat you can play as well.\nIt's a little bit hard to do\nin the context of weightlifting\nin the gym.\nIt's more of a moving\nthrough space kind of thing,\nbut some people do this by\ncounting reps, et cetera.\nI think it's especially\nsuitable for endurance type\nof exercise, especially done outside.\nOne of the reasons I hate\nrunning on a treadmill\nis it just feels like it's never ending.\nAnd I've never tried one\nof these Peloton things.\nI try and avoid looking at screens\nas much as I possibly can.\nBut if you try this next\ntime you're out for a run\nor a swim.\nWhat you'll find is\nthat you have a capacity\nto engage a system of higher energy output\nwhen you focus your eyes\non a particular location,\nbut you want to use that judiciously\nbecause your goal of course,\nis to become efficient at\nmoving through space over time\nand not taxing your brain\nand body to the point\nwhere you arrive at the end of that,\nunless it's race day just\ncompletely tapped out.\nSo that's a kind of\ninteresting aspect of running.\nIf you're a fan of running, which I am,\nand you get the chance to look\nat any of the documentaries\nor docu-drama has made\nabout, [clears throat]\nexcuse me, about Steve Prefontaine.\nIt was clear that he was mostly\nin a battle with himself,\nbut that he was also a highly\ncompetitive individual.\nAnd you'll see this in some of his races.\nI do encourage you to look\nsome of those up on YouTube\nor see the docudramas.\nThey're quite good.\nWhere he ran the...\nEssentially was 12 laps on a track.\nIt's essentially the five.\nIt is the 5,000 meter race\nwhere essentially three miles.\nAnd he essentially tried\nto sprint the whole thing\nwhich is ridiculous.\nActually knowing what you know today\nyou'll realize that Steve Prefontaine\nbasically was pulling\nfrom strength, speed,\npower, muscular, endurance,\nlong duration effort, high intensity,\naerobic, anaerobic as he sort of tried\nto maximize every fuel system.\nAnd you'll see that in\nthe races that he runs,\nbut that when runners are\nnearing the final laps,\nthe so-called bell lap of a race,\nthey'll often look to one another to see\nwhere somebody is obviously\nto assess their progress\nand how close somebody is?\nBut when somebody gets past,\noftentimes you'll see someone\naccess this mysterious kick,\nthis ability to tap into\nsome additional gear\nthat allows them to run forward or faster\nwhen they themselves actually thought\nthat they were maxed out.\nSo someone could be running\nfor the finish line.\nThey're convinced they're going to win.\nThey're going max effort\nor at least they perceive max effort.\nSomeone passes them.\nAnd all of a sudden\nmax effort has changed,\nbecause of that visual target\nthey are able to access higher levels\nof speed and output and\neffort and performance.\nThey don't always catch\nup to that person and win,\nbut having a target a\nmilestone is a powerful way\nthat we can generate more\nforce and energy in anything.\nAnd the visual system\nis the way that we bring\nthose milestones into our brain,\nwhich then brings about epinephrin,\nwhich brings about neural firing,\nwhich allows us to\naccess whatever resources\nhappen to be available to us.\nSo I find this fascinating\nbecause people often wonder,\nlike where does the kick come from?\nWhere is this kind of gift\nof an additional gear?\nWhere is that deeper resource?\nAnd we often express it and talk about it,\nin kind of psychological\nterms like heart or willpower\nor that something kind of\ngot transplanted into us\nor descended into us.\nAnd not to remove any of the\nspiritual aspects of sport\nor running or effort of\nthe human, you know, heart.\nBut it's very clear\nthat the nervous system\nwhen it has a specific visual target\ncan generate the sorts of intense effort\nthat it couldn't otherwise.\nAnd it sometimes even comes as a surprise\nto the person generating the effort.\nI promised that I would\ntalk about programming,\nmeaning when and how many times a week\nto do the various workouts\nrelated to endurance\nand how to merge those with\nother types of exercise\nthat you might be doing\nfor strength or yoga\nor other things that you\nmight be doing like work\nand other things, unrelated to exercise.\nSince that's a vast space\nwith many different parameters\nand you all have different\nlives and lifestyles\nand backgrounds with fitness, et cetera.\nWhat I'm going to do is I'm going to put\nthree different levels\nif you will or protocols\nthat one could adopt in\na link on the show notes.\nSo in the caption on YouTube,\nif you click on that link,\nyou'll be able to see\nthree possible combinations\nof endurance work, strength,\nand hypertrophy work\nor endurance work, flexibility\nand hypertrophy work\nthat are grounded in many\nof the major publications\nthat Dr. Andy Galpin and\ncolleagues and other people\nhave described including this review\nthat's also linked there\non concurrent training\nand how one can use concurrent training,\nmeaning training for endurance,\ntraining for strength,\ntraining for hypertrophy,\ntraining for all these different things\nwithout having to train\nconstantly everyday\ntwice a day, et cetera.\nSo if you are interested\nin taking the protocols\nthat you learned about in this episode\nand in previous episodes\nand combining those,\nwe've placed them there for you\nas a completely zero cost resource.\nPlease understand they are not wholly...\nCostello agrees.\nThey are not wholly.\nThere will be variation in terms\nof what people can tolerate\nand what they have time for?\nBut I think they'll serve\nas a useful guideline\nin getting started or in\ncontinuing with an expanding\non existing endurance work, strength work,\nhypertrophy work and so forth.\nJust really quickly.\nWe didn't talk about\nsupplements much today.\nIn the previous episodes I talked about\nthe phosphocreatine system and\nsupplementing with creatine,\nI talked about beta alanine\nfor kind of moderate duration work.\nYou know really the only\nthings that have been shown\nto really improve endurance\nwork across the four varieties\nof endurance work I described today.\nThey have essentially two forms.\nOne, are stimulants.\nSo things like caffeine will definitely\nimprove endurance work and power output.\nThere's a little bit of evidence\nthat caffeine intake can actually inhibit\nthe function of the creating system,\nbut it's just one study.\nBut that's interesting.\nIf you want to read that study,\nyou can put caffeine into www.examine.com\nand it will take you to that study.\nMany people get sore after workouts,\nin particular workouts\nthat involve a lot of eccentric loading\nor workouts that are very novel\nwhere they've kind of pushed\nit instead of moving gradually\nas I suggest into say high\nintensity anaerobic endurance\nwork of three sets of 20\nseconds on 100 seconds rest.\nMaybe you get over ambitious\nand you do eight sets.\nIn which case you are extremely sore.\nCertain forms of magnesium in particular,\nmagnesium malate, M-A-L-A-T-E.\nHave been shown to be useful for removing\nor reducing the amount of\ndelayed onset muscle soreness.\nThat form of magnesium\nis distinctly different\nthan the sorts of magnesium that are good\nfor getting us into sleep.\nThings like magnesium three\nand eight and Bisglycinate.\nAnd then there's this whole\nthing about beet powder\nand beet juices and things\nthat increase nitric oxide\nand allow for more vasodilation\nand therefore delivery\nof blood to muscle and\nneurons and other tissues\nfor long bouts of endurance work.\nSome people like beet juice\nand they related compounds\nthat increase arginine and vasodilation.\nSome people don't.\nSome people don't feel\ngood when they take those.\nSome people also don't feel good\nwhen they take beta alanine,\nbecause it can give them this feeling\nof kind of like itchy, creepy\ncrawlies under the skin\nkind of the niacin\nphenomenon, the niacin flush.\nSome people don't mind that,\nor some people don't experience that.\nSo when it comes to supplementation\nthere's a lot of variety.\nBut magnesium malate has\nbeen shown to reduce soreness\nas sometimes that's good.\nCold and hot contrast therapy for soreness\nthings of that sort.\nBut in general, we focused\nmainly today on behavioral tools.\nYou'll notice that all of\nthe tools are accessible\nwithout the need for lots of equipment.\nSo I didn't say you need a rower,\nor you need a kettlebell\nthough those will work.\nAnd I hope I was able to\nillustrate for you that endurance\nisn't just one thing.\nIt's not just the ability to\ngo for long bouts of exercise\nof different kinds,\nthat there's also this mental component\nbecause of the way that neurons work.\nAnd also that there are these\ndifferent forms of endurance\nof muscular endurance,\nthat where you're going to fail\n'cause of the muscles and\nmuscle energy utilization\nand the nerves that innovate\nthose muscles locally\nnot because of a failure to\nbring in oxygen or blood.\nWhereas long duration effort.\nIt's going to be more about,\nyou know, being below your VO2 max,\nand your ability to be\nefficient for long bouts\nof more than 12 minutes of exercise.\nOne set, as they say of 12\nminutes to maybe several hours.\nI should just mention with\nlong duration type work.\nYou know, you could even\nimagine raking in the yard\nor mowing a lawn depending\non how big that lawn is.\nI use to have job when\nI was a kid mowing lawns\nand I'll tell you,\nwe didn't have many neighbors\nwith very big lawns,\nbut there are a few of them felt huge\n'cause they were really convoluted.\nAnd if you're pushing that mower,\nand these were the old fashioned mowers\nnot electric mowers, it's work.\nThat's also of the sort\nthat we call long duration\nendurance work.\nHigh intensity training we'll tap\ninto yet other fuel sources and mechanisms\nas we learned today.\nSo if you are enjoying this podcast\nand you're finding the information useful,\nit would be great if you would subscribe\nto the YouTube channel that\nreally helps us quite a lot.\nAnd if you

of the podcast.\nI know ad reads are not the first thing\nthat people want to hear\nwhen they're getting ready\nto consume scientific information.\nPlease understand that the\nads and the sponsors allow us\nto bring the zero cost\nto consumer information\nabout science and science-related\ntools to everybody.\nSo if you have the means,\ncheck out the sponsors.\nWe only work with sponsors whose products\nwe really believe in\nand that I actually use\nand really love.\nThere's no obligation, however.\nAnd we do talk about\nsupplements from time to time.\nAgain, no obligation to use supplements.\nWe also talk about behavioral tools,\nbut if you are interested in supplements,\nplease go to www.examine.com\nto evaluate those supplements\nand their various effects.\nIf you're curious about that.\nAnd we work with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.\nThorne is a supplement manufacturer\nthat we believe has the\nhighest levels of stringency\nin terms of the quality\nof the supplements.\nAnd they are very precise\nand very stringent\nabout the amounts of\neach of those compounds\nin the given supplements.\nThis is a huge problem elsewhere\nin the supplement industry.\nMany brands don't include\nwhat they say they include\non the bottle.\nIt seems to show up every time\npeople test different brands.\nBut Thorne continually tests out\nwith the highest levels of\naccuracy and stringency.\nIf you want to see the\nsupplements that I take,\nyou can go to www.thorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd if you do that you can\nsee all the supplements\nthat I take.\nYou can get 20% off any of\nthose supplements as well.\nIf you want to navigate\ninto the main Thorne site\nand you see a supplement\nthat you're interested in,\nyou'll also get 20% off any\nof those

out to those.\nIt's searchable by keywords\nthat you're interested in.\nSo sleep or exercise,\nweight training, strength,\nfat loss, et cetera.\nAnd you can subscribe to our newsletter,\nthe Neural Network which will allow you\nto get zero cost updates\nabout speaking events,\nabout any book releases or exciting things\nthat I'm reading that I\nthink you would enjoy reading\nas well.\nAs well as protocols related\nto science in some summary\nand important notes from the podcast.\nAnd last but not least on\nbehalf of myself and Costello\nwho's finally waking up for...\nOh, no, he went back to
