    "transcript": "- [Andrew Huberman] Welcome\nto the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools\nfor everyday life.\n- I'm Andrew Huberman, and I'm\na Professor of Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a\npersonalized nutrition platform\nthat analyzes data from your blood and DNA\nto help you better understand your body\nand reach your health goals.\nI've long been a fan of\ngetting blood work done\nfor the simple reason\nthat many of the things\nthat impact our immediate\nand long-term health\ncan only be analyzed from\na quality blood test.\nAnd now with the advent\nof modern DNA tests,\nwe can also get insight into things\nlike metabolic factors\nthat tell us whether\nor not we metabolize caffeine\nwell or certain proteins well,\nwhat our fat metabolism genes are like.\nThings of that sort can only be analyzed\nfrom quality blood and DNA tests.\nIn addition, many of the factors\nthat impact our hormones,\nour metabolism our brain health,\nthose come back in a blood and DNA test\nand there are many blood\nand DNA tests out there,\nbut with InsideTracker, they\ngive you a lot of clear insight\ninto what those markers\nmean and how to adjust them.\nThey have this terrific\nplatform that doesn't just\ngive you the numbers back and tell you\nif you're higher or low in some factor,\nbut rather it tells you\nwhat your levels are\nof all those factors and\ngives you very simple\nand clear directives of changes\nyou might make in your diet,\nchanges that you might make\nin your exercise regimen,\nor sleep, et cetera in\norder to get those markers\nwhere they ought to be\nand where you would like them to be\nin order to optimize yourself.\nSo they make everything\nvery easy, start to finish.\nThey can even come to your home\nto take the blood and\nDNA tests if you like.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll get 25% off\nany of InsideTracker's plans.\nUse the code Huberman at checkout.\nToday's podcast is also brought to us\nby Belcampo Meat Company.\nBelcampo is a regenerative\nfarm in Northern California\nthat raises organic grass fed\nand finished certified humane meats.\nWhile I don't eat a lot of meat, when I do\nI insist that that meat\nbe a very high quality.\nHow the animals were cared for\nis extremely important to me\nand the life that the animal\nhad and what it consumed\nis very important to me.\nSo the way that I eat I've\ndiscussed on this podcast before\nbut very briefly, I basically\nfast until about noon,\nthen I eat a piece of\nbeef or chicken with lunch\nand a salad.\nSo that's basically my lunch.\nThat's what optimizes\nmy levels of alertness\nfor work throughout the day.\nThen in the evening I shift over\nto eating primarily carbohydrates.\nThat's what allows me to sleep very well.\nSo I'm not eating huge volumes of meat\nbut am eating meat every day.\nConventionally raised animals\nare confined to feed lots\nand need to diet of inflammatory grains\nwhich is bad for them and it's bad for us\nwhen we eat their meat.\nBelcampo animals graze on open pastures\nand seasonal grasses resulting in meat\nthat is higher in\nnutrients and healthy fats.\nAnd I've talked before\nabout the importance\nof omega-3 fatty acids for\nboth brain and body health\nand Belcampo meats are high\nin omega-3 fatty acids.\nThe way Belcampo raises its\nanimals isn't just better\nfor your health, it also\nhas a positive impact\non the environment.\nIt's what's called climate\npositive and carbon negative\nwhich means good for the\nplanet and good for us.\nMy favorite meats from Belcampo\nare the rib eye and the flank steaks.\nThat's typically what I eat.\nI think I probably eat about three or four\nof those across the week\nand then I'll eat chicken\non some other days.\nThey're really delicious,\nand as I mentioned,\nthey're very good for us.\nYou can order Belcampo\nsustainably raised meats\nto be delivered straight\nto your door using my code\nHuberman at belcampo.com/huberman.\nIf you do that, you'll get\n20% off first time order.\nThat's belcampo.com/huberman\nfor 20% off your first order.\nToday's episode is also\nbrought to us by Headspace.\nHeadspace is a meditation app backed\nby 25 published studies\nand has over 600,000 five star reviews.\nSo I've been meditating on and off\nsince I was about 15, 16 years\nold, mostly off at first.\nWhat I found is that I'll sometimes\nstart a meditation practice but\nit's very hard to stay with.\nAnd then a few years ago\nI discovered Headspace\nand I started meditating more regularly.\nIn fact, very recently because\nI've had an exorbitant amount\nof work on my plate and\nI've been getting less sleep\nthan I would like in order\nto complete that work,\nI've brought back a regular\nmeditation practice twice a day\nnot just my usual once a day.\nHeadspace makes it really easy.\nThey have so many meditations on there\nand they guide you into the meditation\nand out of the meditation in a way\nthat just makes it very simple\nand makes maintaining the\npractice really straightforward.\nRight now if you want to try Headspace\nyou can go to headspace.com/special offer.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nget a free one month trial.\nSo that's totally free\nwith their full library of\nmeditations for every situation.\nSo there's no meditations\nthat you can't get access\nto with this offer.\nYou can get access to\neverything they've got.\nYou just go to\nheadspace.com/special offer.\nYou get a free one month trial\nand hopefully you'll\ndecide to stay with it.\nI've found that staying with meditation\nhas been immensely beneficial\nfor all aspects of my life.\nToday's episode of the Huberman\nLab Podcast is our fourth\nand final episode in this month\nwhich is all about skills\nand athletic performance.\nNow, in a previous episode,\nwe talked about science-based\nin particular neuroscience-based tools\nfor accelerating fat loss.\nPrevious to that, we talked about ways\nto improve skill learning, motor movements\nwhich also included things like music\nand piano playing not\njust athletic performance.\nAnd we've also been\nexploring other aspects\nof physical performance\nthroughout the entire month.\nToday I want to talk about something\nthat is vitally important for\nnot just athletic performance,\nbut for your entire life and\nindeed for your longevity,\nand that's muscle.\nNow, many of you, when\nyou hear the word muscle\nthink muscle growth and\nbuilding big muscles.\nAnd while we will touch\non muscle hypertrophy\nmuscle growth today, and\nscience-based protocols\nto enhance hypertrophy,\nwe will mainly be talking\nabout muscle as it relates\nto the nervous system.\nAnd I can't emphasize this enough\nthe whole reason why you have a brain is\nso that you can move.\nAnd one of the things that's\nexquisite and fantastic\nabout the human brain,\nis that it can direct\nall sorts of different kinds of movement,\ndifferent speeds of movement,\nmovement of different durations.\nWe can train our\nmusculature to lift heavier\nand heavier objects or we\ncan train our musculature\nto take us further and\nfurther so-called endurance.\nWe can also build smoothness\nof movement, excuse me,\nsmoothness of movement as\nwell as speed of movement,\nsuppleness of movement.\nAll of that is governed\nby the relationship\nbetween the nervous system, neurons\nand their connections to muscle.\nSo when you hear the science of muscle\nand muscle hypertrophy,\nyou might think, oh, well\nI'm not interested in building muscle\nbut muscle does many critical things.\nIt's important for movement.\nIt's important for metabolism.\nThe more muscle you have\nand not just muscle size\nbut the quality of muscle,\nthat's a real thing,\nthe higher your metabolism is,\nand indeed the healthier you are.\nIt turns out that jumping ability\nand ability to stand up quickly\nand to get up off the floor quickly\nis one of the most\npredictive markers of aging\nand biological aging and no\nsurprise that is governed\nby the brain to muscle connection.\nIn addition, muscle and\nmusculature is vital for posture\nand we don't talk about posture enough.\nWe all have been told we\nneed to sit up straight\nor stand up straight, but\nposture is vitally important\nfor how the rest of our body works.\nIt's vital to how we breathe.\nIt's actually even vital to\nhow alert or sleepy we are.\nSo we're going to talk about\nthe musculature for posture.\nWe also are going to talk about muscle\nas it relates to aesthetic things.\nNow, these are all linked.\nMuscle for metabolism,\nmovement, posture and aesthetics\nof course are linked, right?\nAs our posture changes,\nour aesthetic changes.\nAs our posture and aesthetic\nchanges, how we move changes.\nAnd as we improve muscle quality\nwhether or not that's\nincreasing muscle size or not,\nthat changes the way\nthat our entire system\nnot just our nervous system\nand our muscular system\nbut our immune system and the\nother organs of the body work.\nSo today, as always we're going to talk\na little bit of mechanism.\nI'm going to explain how\nneurons control muscle\nand then we're going to\nlook at muscle metabolism,\nhow muscle uses energy.\nI promise to make all of this very simple.\nI'm actually going to keep it very brief\nprobably about 10 minutes total.\nAnd by the end of that 10\nminutes, you will understand a lot\nabout the neuromuscular connection,\nhow your brain and nervous\nsystem control your muscle\nand how those muscles work.\nThen we are going to talk\nabout how muscles use energy\nand can change how they use energy\nfor sake of getting stronger, if you like\nfor also increasing the size\nso-called hypertrophy of muscle\nand for improving endurance as\nwell as for improving posture\nand how you move generally.\nWe will touch on some nutritional themes\nand how that relates\nto muscle in particular\na specific amino acid that\nif it's available in your\nbloodstream frequently enough,\nand at sufficient levels,\ncan help you build\nand improve the quality of muscle.\nAnd we'll talk about\nspecific exercise regimes\nas well as of course, supplementation\nand things that can enhance\nneuromuscular performance overall.\nWe are also going to talk about recovery.\nRecovery as everybody knows,\nis when things improve.\nThat's when neurons get\nbetter at controlling muscle,\nthat's when muscle grows,\nthat's when muscle gets more flexible.\nNone of that actually\nhappens during training.\nIt happens after training and\nthere is a lot of confusion\nabout how to optimize\nrecovery and how to measure\nwhether or not you are recovered\nand ready to come back in\nfor another neuromuscular\ntraining session.\nSo we'll talk about that as well.\nToday is going to have a lot of protocols\nand you're going to come away\nwith a lot of understanding\nabout how you move, how you work\nin these incredible organs\nthat we call the nervous system\nand the musculature, the\nso-called neuromuscular system.\nBefore we dive into today's topic,\nI want to just take about three minutes\nand cover some essential\nsummary of the previous episode.\nIn the previous episode,\nwe talked about fat loss.\nTalked about shiver induced fat loss.\nWe talked about neat non-exercise\nactivity thermogenesis\nfor increasing caloric\nburn and fat oxidation.\nAnd we talked about how\nto use cold specifically\nto enhance fat loss.\nI described a protocol\ninvolving getting into cold\nof some sort, whether or not\nit's ice bath, cold shower,\nsome form of cold could\neven be a river or an ocean\nif you have access to\nthat and inducing shiver\nand then getting out, not\ncrossing your arms or huddling\nbut allowing that cold to evaporate\noff you and continuing to shiver\nand then getting back into\nthe colder environment\nof water or stream or shower, et cetera.\nAll of that is described\nin a beautifully illustrated protocol\nthat I didn't illustrate.\nThat's why it's beautifully illustrated\nat the coldplunge.com.\nThey've made that protocol for you\nand they've made it available\nfree of charge for you.\nSo there's no obligation\nthere of any kind financially.\nYou can go to the coldplunge.com.\nThere's a little tab that says protocols\nand you can download that\nprotocol, someone there\nI don't know who exactly illustrated it,\nand you can come away with a PDF\nof what I described in\nthe previous episode.\nSo I just want to make sure\nthat you are aware of that resource.\nThe other announcement\nI'd like to make is that\nmany of you have asked how you\ncan help support the podcast.\nAnd there's a very straightforward\nzero cost way to do that.\nAnd that's to subscribe\nto our YouTube channel.\nSo if you go to YouTube,\nif you're not already\nthere watching this now\nhits the Subscribe button\nthat helps us tremendously\nto get the word out more\nbroadly about the podcast.\nAnd we thank you for your support.\nMost people, when they\nhear the word muscle\nthey just think about strength.\nBut of course muscles are\ninvolved in everything that we do.\nThey are involved in speaking,\nthey're involved in\nsitting and standing up,\nthey're involved in lifting\nobjects, including ourselves.\nThey are absolutely essential\nfor maintaining how we breathe.\nThey're absolutely essential\nfor ambulation, for moving,\nand for skills of any kind.\nSo when we think about muscle,\nwe don't just want to think about muscle\nthe meat that is muscle, but\nwhat controls that muscle.\nAnd no surprise what controls\nmuscle is the nervous system.\nThe nervous system does that\nthrough three main nodes of\ncontrol areas of control.\nAnd I've talked about these\nbefore on a previous podcast.\nSo I will keep this very brief.\nBasically, we have upper motor\nneurons in our motor cortex.\nSo those are in our skull\nand those are involved\nin deliberate movement.\nSo if I decide that I'm\ngoing to pick my pen\nup and put it down, which\nis what I'm doing right now,\nmy upper motor neurons were involved\nin generating that movement.\nThose upper motor\nneurons send signals down\nto my spinal cord where there\nare two categories of neurons.\nOne are the lower motor neurons\nand those lower motor\nneurons send little wires\nthat we call axons out to our muscles\nand cause those muscles to contract.\nThey do that by dumping\nchemicals onto the muscle.\nIn fact, the chemical is acetylcholine.\nI've talked before about\nacetylcholine in the brain\nwhich is vitally important for focus\nand actually can gait neuroplasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nBut in the neuromuscular system,\nacetylcholine released from\nmotor neurons is the way\nthe only way that muscles can contract.\nNow, there's another category of neurons\nin the spinal cord called\ncentral pattern generators\nor CPGs.\nAnd those are involved\nin rhythmic movements.\nAnytime we're walking or doing something\nwhere we don't have to think about it\nto do it deliberately, it's\njust happening reflexively\nthat central pattern\ngenerators and motor neurons.\nAnytime we're doing\nsomething deliberately,\nthe top-down control as we call it,\nfrom the upper motor neurons comes in\nand takes control of that system.\nSo it's really simple.\nYou've only got three ingredients.\nYou've got the upper motor\nneurons, the lower motor neurons\nand for rhythmic movements\nthat are reflexive,\nyou've also got the\ncentral pattern generators.\nSo it's a terrifically\nsimple system at that level,\nbut what we're going to focus on today is\nhow that system can control muscle\nin ways that make that system better.\nNow, when I say better, I\nwant to be very specific.\nIf your goal is to build larger muscles,\nthere's a way to use your nervous system\nto trigger hypertrophy\nto increase the size\nof those muscles.\nAnd it is indeed controlled\nby the nervous system.\nSo you can forget the idea\nthat the muscles have memory\nor that muscles grow in\nresponse to something\nthat's just happening within the muscle,\nit's the nerve to muscle connection\nthat actually creates hypertrophy.\nI'll talk exactly about how\nto optimize that process.\nIn addition, if you want\nto improve endurance\nor improve flexibility or\nsuppleness or explosiveness,\nthat is all accomplished by the way\nthat the nervous system\nengages muscles specifically.\nAnd so what that means is\nwe have to ask ourselves\nare we going to take control\nof the upper motor neurons,\nthe central pattern generators,\nor the lower motor neurons\nor all three in order\nto get to some end point\nof how the nervous system controls muscle.\nSo neurophysiology 101.\nI'll give you one piece of history\nbecause it's important to know.\nSherrington, who won the Nobel prize\ncalled movement, the final common path.\nWhy did he say that?\nWell, the whole reason for\nhaving a nervous system\nthe whole reason for having a brain is\nso that we can control our\nmovements in very dedicated ways.\nThat is one of the reasons,\nperhaps the predominant reason\nwhy the human brain is so large.\nYou might think, oh it's\nso large for thinking\nand for creativity.\nAh, no when you look at\nthe amount of real estate\nin the brain that's devoted\nto different aspects of life,\nit's mainly vision, our ability to see\nand movement, our ability to engage\nin lots of different kinds of movements.\nSlow movements, fast movements,\nexplosive, et cetera.\nOther animals don't have that ability\nbecause they don't have\nthe mental real estate.\nThey don't have the neural\nreal estate in their brain.\nThey have neuromuscular junctions.\nThey have central pattern generators\nwhat they don't have\nare these incredible upper motor neurons\nthat can direct activity the\nmuscles in very specific ways.\nSo we can all feel blessed\nthat we have this system.\nAnd today I'm going to teach\nyou how to use that system\ntoward particular end points.\nSo if we decide that we are\ngoing to direct our muscles\nin some particular movement of any kind.\nWhether or not it's a\nweightlifting exercise,\nor whether it's a yoga movement\nor simply picking up\nand putting down a pen,\nwe are engaging flexors and extensors\nand our body is covered with\nflexors and extensors all over.\nSo for instance, our bicep is a flexor\nand our tricep is an extensor.\nThose are what are called\nantagonistic muscles.\nThey move the limbs in\nopposite directions.\nSo if you bring your wrist\ncloser to your shoulder,\nthat's flection using your bicep.\nIf you move your wrist further\naway from your shoulder,\nthat's extension, using your tricep.\nAnd without getting into a lot of detail\nthe way that the nerves and\nbrain are wired up to muscle\nmake it such that when\na flexor is activated,\nwhen the nerve dumps\nchemical acetylcholine\nonto the muscle to activate the biceps,\nthe triceps is inhibited.\nIt's prevented from engaging.\nThere are ways to bypass this\nbut that's the typical mode of action.\nThe converse is also true when\nour tricep is in activated,\nwhen we move our wrist\naway from our shoulder\nour bicep is inhibited.\nAnd we have flexors like\nour abdominal muscles.\nAnd we have extensors in our lower back.\nMany of you probably know this\nbut some of you probably\ndon't that your spine\nhas flexors to move basically\nyour chin toward your waist.\nAnd it has, those are your\nabdominal muscles among others.\nAnd you have extensors that\nmove your chin, basically back\nlike looking up toward the ceiling.\nAnd those are your extensors.\nYou have other muscles that\nare stabilizing muscles\nand things of that sort\nbut those movements of\nflection and extension,\nand the fact that they are\nwhat we call reciprocally\ninnovated or mutual inhibition,\nyou hear different language around this\nis characteristic of most\nof our limb movements.\nSo hamstring and quadriceps,\nthe hamstring brings the ankle\ncloser back towards the glutes.\nBasically it's lifting your heel up\nwhich is almost always\ndone toward the back.\nWhereas your quadriceps is the extensor\nopposite to the hamstrings.\nSo you get the idea.\nSo there's flexors and extensors\nand it's the neurons that\ncontrol those flexors\nand extensors that allow us\nto move in particular ways.\nSo, now you have heard a\nneuromuscular physiology\nin its simplest form, but I\ndo want this to be accessible.\nI want to get just briefly, just briefly\ninto some of the underlying metabolism\nof how muscles use and create energy.\nBecause in doing that, we\nwill be in a great position\nto understand all the\ntools that follow about\nhow to optimize the neuromuscular system\nfor your particular goals.\nSo in the previous episode about fat loss,\nwe talked about lipolysis.\nThe breakdown of fat into fatty acids\nso it can be used as fuel.\nAnd it ended in a step where we got ATP,\nwhich is the bottleneck\nand final common path\nfor all energy producing\nfunctions in the body.\nThere are other ways but basically ATP\nis the key element there.\nNow with muscles, they don't\nfunction on fats normally\nwhat they are going to function\non their ability to move\nand their ability to do\nthings and allow us to move\nin any way that we want to,\nis based on a process of glycolysis,\nthe breakdown of things like glycogen\nand glucose into energy.\nAnd it's a very simple process.\nYou don't have to know any chemistry.\nSo if I say the words carbon or hydrogen\nor something like that, don't freak out.\nYou don't have to\nunderstand any chemistry.\nBut basically what\nhappens is you've got this\navailable sugar resource\nthat stored in muscle.\nAnd that's glucose.\nAnd that glucose has six carbons\nand six waters, basically.\nThat can be broken down into\ntwo sets of three carbons.\nAll right.\nSo basically you take\nglucose and you break it\ninto these two little batches of carbons\nthat we call pyruvate.\nSo six divided by two is three.\nSo you get three and three pyruvate.\nAnd that generates a\nlittle bit of ATP of energy\nbut just a little bit.\nNow, if there's oxygen available,\nif there's sufficient oxygen there,\nwhat can happen is that\npyruvate can be brought\nto the mitochondria and\nthrough a whole set of things\nthat you probably don't\nwant to hear about right now\nlike the electron transport\nchain and citric acid cycle.\nWhat happens is it's broken\ndown and you get 28 to 30 ATP,\nwhich has a lot of ATP.\nSo the only things you need to know,\nthe only things you need\nto know about this process\nis that glucose and glycogen\nare broken down into pyruvate.\nYou a little bit of energy from that.\nAnd when I say energy, I\nmean the ability to move.\nIt's fuel, literally just gets burned up.\nBut if there's oxygen\navailable and that's key\nthen within the mitochondria,\nyou can create 28 to 30 ATP\nwhich is a lot of ATP.\nNow, what does this mean?\nThis means that movement of muscle\nis metabolically expensive\nand indeed compared\nto other tissues compared\nto fat, compared to bone,\ncompared to almost all other\ntissues, except brain tissue\nmuscle is the most metabolically demanding\nwhich is why people who\nhave more muscle relative\nto adipose tissue to\nfat, they can eat more\nand they're more of a furnace.\nThey just kind of burn that up.\nSo even if you didn't understand\nanything that I just said,\nwhat you probably did hear,\nand that I hope you heard\nis that if you have oxygen\naround, you can create energy\nfrom this fuel source that\nwe call glycogen and glucose.\nBut what if there isn't oxygen around?\nAnd what is that like?\nWell, you've experienced that.\nI'm not talking about\noxygen in the environment.\nI'm talking about oxygen in the muscle.\nSo if you've ever carried\na box while moving,\nor you're carrying heavy\ngroceries to the car,\nor you're exercising particularly hard\nand you felt the burn, well, that burning\nwhich most people think is\nlactic acid is actually a process\nby which pyruvate, which as I said before\nnormally could be converted\ninto ATP if there's oxygen,\nwell, if there's not enough oxygen\n'cause that muscle is\nworking too hard or too long,\nwhat ends up happening is that\na hydrogen molecule comes in there\nand you get something called lactate.\nSo believe it or not, humans\ndon't make lactic acid.\nThat's another species, we make lactate.\nAnd we hear that lactate is bad.\nWe need to buffer the\nburn or avoid the burn.\nThat lactic acid and\nlactate are what prevent us\nfor performing as well\nas we ought to be able to\nor going as far as we possibly could\nin an endurance event.\nGuess what, that's not true at all.\nLactate has three functions,\nall of which are really\ninteresting and really important.\nFirst of all, it's a\nbuffer against acidity.\nYou don't want muscle to get too acidic\nbecause it can't function.\nYou don't want any body\ntissue to get too acidic.\nSo that burn that you feel is\nacidity in that environment\nand lactate what most\npeople call lactic acid,\nbut again, we don't make lactic acid.\nLactate is there to buffer that\nto reduce the amount of burn.\nSo, most people have\nthis exactly backwards.\nSo when you feel that burn\nthat is not lactic acid,\nthat is lactate that's\npresent to suppress the burn,\nto suppress acidity.\nIt's also a fuel.\nWhen you feel that burn,\nlactate is shuttled to\nthose areas of the muscle,\nand there's an actual fuel burning process\nwhere in the absence of oxygen\nyou can continue to generate\nmuscular contractions.\nNow, this is informative\n'cause it also tells us that\nthat burning that acidity that we feel\ncan inhibit the way that our muscles work\nbut that lactate comes\nin and allows our muscles\nto continue to function.\nSo we'll talk a little bit more about\nwhat this whole lactate\nthing and the burn means\nbut it's a really important process.\nAnd it's amazing to me that\nmost people understand it\nin exactly the incorrect way.\nThey think a lactic acid\nis bad and the burn is bad.\nNo, it reveals a number\nof really important things\nare going on with this\nvital molecule lactate,\nwhich can reduce acidity, reduce the burn\nas well as act as a fuel.\nNow, here's where it\ngets really, really cool.\nAnd if you don't have enough\nof an incentive to exercise\nbased on all the information out there\nabout how it'll make you live longer\nand make your heart better, et cetera,\nhere's a reason that regardless\nof what kind of exercise you do,\nif it's weight training, or\nrunning, or cycling, or swimming\nthat every once in a while,\nabout 10% of the time\nyou should exercise to\nthe point of intensity\nwhere you start to feel\nthat so-called burn.\nThe reason for that is\nthat lactate shows up\nto the site of the burn, so to speak,\nand it acts as a hormonal\nsignal for other organs\nof the body in a very positive way.\nAs you may recall, from\na very early episode\nof the Huberman Lab\nPodcast, I talked about\nwhat a hormone is and how it works.\nWe have lots of different\nkinds of hormones\nbut hormones are chemicals that\nare released in one location\nin the body and travel,\nhave effects on lots\nof other organs of the body.\nSo when I say that lactate\nacts as a hormonal signal,\nwhat I mean is that it's in a\nposition to influence tissues\nthat are outside of the muscle.\nAnd basically it can send signals\nto the heart, to the\nliver and to the brain,\nand it can have effects\non the heart, the liver\nand the brain that are very positive.\nSo just to zoom out for a second\nI promise we won't get any\nmore technical than this.\nWe will get into tools and protocols\nthat are really straightforward\nbut what I'm telling you is that\nif you feel a burn from a\nparticular exercise or movement,\nthat burn is going to be buffered\nby this molecule we call lactate.\nLactate will then provide additional fuel\nfor additional work.\nSo this is a good incentive\nprovided you can do it safely\nto \"Work through the burn.\"\nThat burn acts as a beacon to the lactate\nwhich comes in and allows\nyou to do more work.\nIt's not a signal to stop necessarily.\nI mean, stop if you're\ndoing something unsafe\nbut it's a signal that\nlactate should come in\nand allow you to continue to do work.\nAnd it can act as a hormonal signal.\nLactate can then travel to the heart\nand to the liver and to the brain\nand can enhance their\nfunction in positive ways,\nnot just in those moments,\nbut in the period of time that follows.\nSo many people are curious\nabout how they can exercise\nto make their brain better.\nThat's one of the most\ncommon questions I get.\nWhat I'm telling you is that\nprovided you can do it safely\nby engaging the so-called burn\nwhich is at a different\nthreshold for everybody,\nyour hill run will be\ndifferent than my hill run\nto generate the burn,\nbut provided you can do that for about 10%\nof your workouts or of\nan individual workout,\nor activity of any kind, you\nare generating the activity\nof this lactate based hormonal signal\nthat can improve the function of neurons.\nAnd it does that if you want\nto know for the aficionados\nby improving the function\nof another cell type\ncalled the astrocytes which\nare a glial cell type.\nWhich are very involved in clearance\nof debris from the brain,\nthey're involved in the\nformation of synopsis\nconnections between neurons in the brain.\nSo put simply, if you are an exerciser\nif you're doing movement of\nany kind, and you're interested\nin allocating some of that\nmovement toward enhancing\nbrain, heart and liver\nhealth, there is a nice set\nof scientific data that points to the fact\nthat getting a lactate\nshuttled to the muscles\nby engaging this burning\nsensation is advantageous\nfor the health of those other tissues.\nSo, as I mentioned that burn is present\nfrom lack of oxygen being present.\nAnd then the hydrogen comes\nin and you get this lactate.\nBut this process of\nlactate acting as a buffer\nof fuel and a positive hormonal\nsignal for other tissues,\noccurs only if there's oxygen.\nSo if you feel the burn,\nyou definitely want to focus\non your breathing at that point.\nThat would be the time\nto take deep inhales\nand try and bring more\noxygen into your system.\nIt's definitely not a\ntime to hold your breath.\nAnd if ever you've run to\nthe point of feeling the burn\nand then you were exercised\nin any way on the treadmill\nor on the bike or whatever,\nand felt that burn,\nand then you held your breath,\nit feels much more intense.\nBy breathing you bring lactate to the site\nand you are able to\nallow lactate to act more\nas a buffer, a fuel,\nand a hormonal signal.\nAnd the reason I brought this up today is\nbecause as I mentioned so\nmany people are interested\nin using exercise not just for sake\nof improving physical health\nand wellbeing and performance,\nbut also for enhancing their brain.\nAnd there are a lot of\ndata out there speaking\nto the findings that\nexercise of various kinds\ncan increase neurogenesis,\nthe creation of new neurons.\nWell, the unfortunate news is that\nwhile that's true in mice,\nthere is very little evidence\nfor enhanced neurogenesis\nfrom exercise or otherwise in humans.\nThere's a little bit,\nand there are a few sites\nwithin the brain, such\nas the dentate gyrus\nof the hippocampus, which may be involved\nin the formation of new\nmemories, to be clear\nthe dentate gyrus is definitely involved\nin the formation of new memories,\nwhether or not the new\nneurons that are added there\nin humans are involved in new memories.\nThe evidence for that\nis weak at best, frankly\nwhereas an animals the\ndata are quite strong,\nbut most of the data points to the fact\nthat hormonal signals,\nthings that are transported\nin the blood during exercise\nare beneficial for the brain\nand that those signals are\nnot causing the increase\nin the number of neurons in\nthe dentate gyrus or otherwise.\nThat it's more about the\nhealth of the connections\nbetween the neurons growth\nfactors of various kinds\nthings like IGF-1, there's\na long list of these things.\nSo if you've heard the\nexercise increases the number\nof neurons in your brain,\nwell, that's not true.\nAnd that probably is a good thing, frankly\nbecause we always hear\nmore neurons, more neurons\nas if it's a good thing, but\nthe brain doesn't do so well\nwith bringing in entirely new elements.\nIt has a hard time negotiating that\nand making use of those new elements.\nWe know about this from things\nlike the cochlear implant\nwhere deaf people are given a device\nwhere they suddenly can hear.\nSome people really like that,\ndeaf people really like that\nand can benefit from it.\nOther deaf people find\nthat it's very intrusive.\nThat is hard to take an existing\nneural circuit in the brain\nand incorporate a lot of\nnew information into it.\nSo new neurons, as great as that sounds\nmore neurons, more neurons,\nit actually might not be the best way\nfor the nervous system to\nchange and modify itself\nand to promote its own longevity.\nSo when I tell you not such great evidence\nfrom new neurons past puberty,\nthat's what the data\nreally show in humans.\nAnd I sort of knocked back the data\non exercise and neurogenesis,\ndon't let that depress you.\nIf you have dementia in your family,\ndon't translate that into necessarily\nthat you will develop dementia.\nUnderstand the exercise\nis still beneficial\nfor the brain and other\naspects of the nervous system\nbut that it's going to be doing it\nthrough these hormonal signals.\nThings like IGF-1, things\nlike this lactate pathway\nwhen you experience\nthe burn from exercise.\nAnd again, you don't want to try\nand get this feeling of a burn\nthroughout the entire episode of exercise,\nthere'll be far too intense and\nwould inhibit your recovery.\nI don't think it'd be good\nfor performance either.\nIt's only about 10% of your total effort\nin any one exercise about\nthat's going to give you\nthis positive effect.\nSo now you know how to\ndevote a small portion\nof your exercise, 10% in\norder for muscle and lactate\nto benefit other tissues\nnamely your heart, your\nliver, and your brain.\nI'd now like to shift our attention\nto how to use specific aspects\nof muscular contraction\nto improve muscle\nhypertrophy, muscle growth,\nas well as improving muscle strength.\nThere are a lot of reasons\nto want to get stronger.\nAnd I should just mention\nthat it's not always the case\nthat getting stronger involves\nmuscles getting bigger.\nThere are ways for muscles to get stronger\nwithout getting bigger.\nHowever, increasing the size of a muscle\nalmost inevitably increases\nthe strength of that muscle\nat least to some degree.\nReasons why most everyone should want\nto get their muscles stronger is that\nmuscles are generally\ngetting progressively weaker\nacross the lifespan.\nSo when I say getting\nstronger, it's not necessarily\nabout being able to move increasing mounts\nof weight in the gym.\nAlthough if that's your goal\nwhat I'm about to discuss\nwill be relevant to that,\nbut rather to offset some of\nthe normal decline in strength\nand posture and the ability\nto generate a large range\nof movement safely, that occurs as we age.\nAs I mentioned at the\nbeginning of the episode\nwe just tend to lose function\nin this neuromuscular system\nas we get older.\nAnd doing things to offset that\nhas been shown again and\nagain, to be beneficial\nfor the neuromuscular system\nfor protection of injury,\nfor enhancing the strength\nof bones and bone density.\nSo there are a lot of reasons\nto use resistance exercise\nthat extend far beyond just the desire\nto increase muscle size\nbecause I know many\nof you are interested in\nincreasing muscle size,\nbut many of you are not.\nSo there's an important\nprinciple of muscle physiology\ncalled the Henneman size principle.\nAnd the Henneman size\nprinciple essentially says\nthat we recruit what\nare called motor units.\nMotor units are just the connections\nbetween nerve and muscle from in a pattern\nthat staircases from low\nthreshold to high threshold.\nWhat this means is when you\npick up something that is light,\nyou're going to use the\nminimum amount of nerve\nto muscle energy in\norder to move that thing.\nLikewise, when you pick\nup an object that's heavy,\nyou're going to use the\nminimum amount of nerve\nto muscle connectivity and energy\nin order to move that object.\nSo it's basically a conservation\nof energy principle.\nNow, if you continue to\nexert effort of movement,\nwhat will happen is you will tend\nto recruit more and more\nmotor units with time.\nAnd that process of\nrecruiting more neurons,\nmore lower motor neurons\nif you recall from the\nbeginning of the episode,\nthese lower motor neurons\nare in our spinal cord\nand they actually dump a\nchemical acetylcholine on muscle,\ncaused the muscles to contract.\nAs you recruit more and\nmore of these motor units,\nthese connections between these\nlower motor neurons and muscle,\nthat's when you start to\nget changes in the muscle.\nThat's when you open the\ngate for the potential\nfor the muscles to get\nstronger and to get larger,\nif that's what your goal is.\nAnd so the way this process works\nhas been badly misunderstood\nin the kind of online\nliterature of weight training\nand bodybuilding, and\neven in sports physiology.\nThe Henneman size principle is kind of\na foundational principle\nwithin muscle physiology\nbut many people have come\nto interpret it by saying\nthat the way to recruit\nhigh threshold motor units,\nthe ones that are hard to get to\nis to just use heavy weights.\nAnd that's actually not the case\nas we'll talk about the research supports\nthat weights in a very large\nrange of sort of a percentage\nof your maximum, anywhere from 30% to 80%.\nSo weights that are not very\nlight but are moderately light,\ntoo heavy can cause\nchanges in the connections\nbetween nerve and muscle that lead\nto muscle strength and muscle hypertrophy.\nPut differently, heavyweights\ncan help build muscle\nand strength but they are not required.\nWhat one has to do is adhere\nto a certain number of parameters,\njust a couple of key variables\nthat I'll spell out for you.\nAnd if you do that, you can greatly\nincrease muscle hypertrophy, muscle size\nand or muscle strength if\nthat's what you want to do.\nAnd you don't necessarily\nhave to use heavy weights\nin order to do that.\nNow, I'm sure the power lifters\nand the people that like to\nmove heavy weights around\nwill say, no, if you want to get strong\nyou absolutely have to lift heavy weights.\nAnd that might be true if\nyou want to get very strong\nbut for most people who are interested\nin supporting their muscular\nsuch that they offset\nany age related decline in strength,\nor in increasing hypertrophy\nand strength to some degree,\nthere really isn't a need\nto lie about the Henneman size principle\nwhich many people out there are doing\nand claiming that you absolutely need\nto use the heaviest weights possible\nin order to build strength and muscle.\nSo I'm going to explain all\nof this works in simple terms.\nSo first of all, let's just\ntalk about what hypertrophy is\nand what strength changes\nin the muscle are.\nWe can make this very simple as well.\nIf this were a muscle physiology class\nwe would talk all about myofibrils\nand sarcomeres and all that stuff.\nWe're not going to do that.\nThat's not the purpose\nof today's conversation.\nIf you're interested in that\nas well as a lot of the other information\nthat I'm going to discuss in more detail,\nI highly encourage you to\ncheck out the YouTube channel\nand the writings of Dr. Andy Galpin.\nHe's a PhD and a full professor\nin exercise physiology.\nHe's extremely knowledgeable\nin this entire area\nof science-based tools for hypertrophy,\nhow strength and hypertrophy really work.\nHis lab does everything\nfrom biopsy on muscles,\nworking with athletes and\ntypical folks as well.\nA lot of the information\nthat you're going to hear\nfrom me in the next 15 minutes or so\ncomes from an extensive\nexploration of the work\nthat he and his colleagues\nhave done as well\nas folks like Brad Schoenfeld,\nanother academic who's superb\nin this whole space of muscle physiology\nand from a lengthy conversation\nthat I had with Andy,\nDr. Galpin prior to this episode.\nSo if we want to think\nabout muscle hypertrophy,\nwe have to ask what is changing\nwhen muscles get larger or stronger.\nAnd there are really just three ways\nthat muscles can be stimulated to change.\nSo let's review those three ways\nand talk about what\nhappens inside the muscle.\nSo there are three major stimulate\nfor changing the way that muscle works\nand making muscles stronger,\nlarger, or better in some way.\nAnd those are stress, tension, and damage.\nThose three things don't\nnecessarily all have to be present\nbut stress of some kind has to exist.\nSomething has to be different\nin the way that the nerve communicates\nwith the muscle and the way\nthat the muscle contracts\nor performs that makes\nthe muscle need to change.\nSo this is very reminiscent of\nneuroplasticity in the brain.\nSomething needs to happen.\nCertain chemicals need to be present.\nCertain processes need to happen\nor else a tissue simply\nwon't change itself.\nBut if those processes\nand events do happen,\nthen the tissue has\nessentially no option except,\nbut to change.\nSo muscles move, as I mentioned\nbecause nerves dump\nchemical onto the muscles\nbut they move because they\nhave these things called myosin\nand actin filaments.\nAnd if you want to read up on this,\nyou can look on the internet\nyou can put the sliding filament theory\nof muscle contraction if you\nreally want to go deep down\nthat rabbit hole.\nIt's interesting.\nYou can learn about this in\na muscle physiology class.\nBut basically, along\nthe length of the muscle\nyou have, what's called myosin.\nAnd just think of myosin\nas kind of like a wire.\nIt's like a bunch of beads and wires\nthat extend across the muscle.\nI think that's the simplest\nway to describe it.\nAnd the myosin is surrounded\nby these little beads called actin.\nThe way muscles get bigger is\nthat basically the myosin gets thicker.\nIt's a protein and it gets thicker.\nSo put this in your mind\nif you're listening to this\nor even if you're watching it on YouTube,\nthe way to think about this\nwhole actin myosin thing\nand thing and muscles\ngetting bigger is imagine\nthat you're holding a bouquet of balloons,\na bunch of balloons by their strings\nexcept you're not holding the\nstrings all at their bottom.\nSo the bouquet isn't nicely arranged.\nIt's not like some balloons\nthat are all up at the top\nand you're holding the\nstrings down at the bottom.\nImagine that one of the\nballoons that is very close\nto your hand and other one\nis a little bit higher up.\nAnd so this bouquet is very disorganized.\nIn other words, the string\nextending out of your hand\nthe strings rather\nextending out of your hand\nare all different lengths.\nAnd so the balloons\nare all over the place.\nThat's essentially what myosin\nlooks like in the muscle.\nAnd those strings are what\nwe call the filaments,\nand then the myosin head is the balloon.\nWhen you stress a muscle properly,\nor you give it sufficient tension,\nor you damage the muscle just enough,\nthere's an adaptive\nresponse that takes place\nwhere protein is synthesized.\nAnd it's a very specific\nprotein, it's myosin.\nThe myosin gets thicker.\nIn other words, the balloons get bigger.\nSo the way to think about muscle growth\nand the way to think about\nmuscles getting stronger is\nthat those balloons get bigger\nand the muscle gets thicker.\nNow, the question then should be as always\nhow does that happen?\nI mean, the muscle doesn't\nreally know anything\nabout what's happening\nin the outside world.\nThe way it happens is\nthe nerve, the neuron has\nto tell the muscle to get stronger.\nAnd it does that through what\nwe call a signaling cascade.\nIt talks to the muscle\nin terms of chemicals.\nIt doesn't whisper to it or\nshout or Hey, get bigger.\nWhat it does it release\na certain chemicals\nthat within the muscle,\nthere are certain\nchemicals released rather\nthat make those balloons\nas I'm referring to them,\nthe myosin get thicker.\nSo let's talk about the\nstimulus for doing that.\nAnd if already in your\nmind, you're imagining\noh my goodness, these balloons of muscle\nare going to get thick,\nthick, thick, thick, thick,\nand it's just going to\nspiral out of control,\ndon't worry about that.\nPeople invest a ton of time and energy\ninto trying to make their muscles larger.\nIt's actually much harder for people to do\nthan you might think.\nBut I do want to give one\nexception because it illustrates\nan important principle of\nwhere we're headed next.\nEverybody has imbalances\nin how muscles can grow.\nHow well muscles can grow, or how poorly,\nor how challenging it is\nfor their muscles to grow.\nNow, many people who are afraid\nof like getting too bulky\nfor instance, are afraid\nof lifting weights.\nBut I think the research\nshows now that every one\nof pretty much every age should be doing\nsome sort of resistance exercise\neven if that's body weight exercises\nin order to offset this\nage-related decline\nin muscle contractile ability,\nmuscle strength, et cetera,\nimprove bone density.\nThere's nothing good about\ngetting frail and weak over time.\nAnd people who invest the effort\ninto doing resistance\nexercises of some kind\nwhether or not it's with\nbands or with weights\nor with body weight,\nreally benefit tremendously\nat a whole body level at a systemic level\nas well as in terms of muscle strength.\nThere is a good predictor of how well\nor how efficient you will\nbe in building the strength\nand or if you like the\nsize of a given muscle.\nAnd it has everything to do\nwith those upper motor neurons\nthat are involved in\ndeliberate control of muscle.\nYou can actually do this test right now.\nYou can just kind of March\nacross your body mentally\nand see whether or not you\ncan independently contract any\nor all of your muscles.\nSo for instance, if you\nare sitting in a chair\nor a you're standing,\nsee whether or not you can\ncontract your calf muscle\njust using those upper motor\nneuron, sending a signal down\nand deliberately\nisolating the calf muscle.\nIf you can contract the calf muscle hard\nto the point where that\nmuscle almost feels\nlike it's starting to cramp\nlike it hurts just a little bit,\nthat can be extremely painful\nnor is it going to have\nno sensation whatsoever,\nchances are you have very good\nupper motor neuron to calf control.\nAnd chances are, if you can isolate that\nwhat they call the brain\nor mind muscle connection,\nand you can contract the muscles\nto the point where it cramps a little bit,\nthat you hold a decent to high potential\nto change the strength and\nthe size of that muscle\nif you train it properly.\nNow, if you have a hard time doing that,\nchances are you won't be able to do that.\nIf for instance, you\nfocus on your back muscle.\nLike we all have these\nmuscles called the lat.\nThe latissimus dorsi muscles,\nwhich basically are involved\nin chin ups and things like that,\nbut their function from a more\nof a kinesiology standpoint\nis to move the elbow back behind the body.\nSo it's not about flexing your bicep.\nIt's about moving your\nelbow back behind your body.\nIf you can do that, mentally\nor you can do that physical movement\nof moving your elbow back behind your body\nand you can contract that muscle hard,\nchances are that you have the capacity\nto enhance the strength and or size\nof that particular muscle\nbecause you have the neural\ncontrol of that muscle.\nThis is a key feature of\nthe neuromuscular system\nto appreciate as we begin to talk more\nabout specific protocols.\nBecause everything about\nmuscle hypertrophy,\nabout stimulating muscle growth is\nabout generating isolated contractions\nabout challenging specific\nmuscles in a very unnatural way.\nWhereas with strength, it's\nabout using musculature\nas a system moving\nweights, moving resistance,\nmoving the body.\nThe specific goal of hypertrophy is\nto isolate specific\nnerve to muscle pathways\nso that you stimulate the chemical\nand signaling transduction\nevents in muscle\nso that those muscles\nrespond by getting larger.\nSo there's a critical distinction\nin terms of getting stronger versus trying\nto get muscles to be\nlarger hypertrophy per se.\nAnd it has to do with how much\nyou isolate those muscles.\nMuscle isolation is not\na natural phenomenon.\nIt's not something that we normally do.\nWhen we walk we don't think,\nokay, right calf contract,\nleft calf contract.\nNo, you just generate\nthose rhythmic movements.\nAnd of course, there's no\nreason for them to get stronger\nor larger in response to those movements.\nLet's say you were to do a\nkind of strange experiment\nof attaching 30 pound\nweights to your ankles.\nAnd you were to do those movements.\nWell, if you weren't specifically\ncontracting your calves\nin each step, there's\nno reason for the calves\nto take on the bulk of the work.\nAnd you would distribute that\nwork across your hip flexors\nand other aspects of your musculature.\nYour whole nervous system\nseeks to gain efficiency.\nIt seeks to spread out the effort.\nSo you can nest this as\na principle for yourself\nwhich is if you want to get stronger\nit's really about moving\nprogressively greater loads\nor increasing the amount\nof weight that you move.\nWhereas if you're specifically interested\nin generating hypertrophy,\nit's all about trying\nto generate those really hard,\nalmost painful localized\ncontractions of muscle.\nNow, of course, how much weight you use\nin order to generate those contractions\nwill also impact hypertrophy.\nBut I think most people\ndon't really understand\nthe mind muscle connection.\nIt sounds like a great thing,\nbut it's actually one of\nthe things you want to avoid\nif your goal is simply\nto become more supple\nor to become stronger.\nYou want to do the movements\nproperly and safely, of course\nbut it's the opposite of hypertrophy\nwhere with hypertrophy\nyou're really trying to make\nthat particular muscle\nsometimes two muscles\ndo the majority, if not all the work\nwhereas in moving force loads\nin trying to generate activity of any kind\nlike lifting a bar, doing\na chin up or something\nthose so-called compound\nmovements involve a lot\nof muscle groups.\nIf your goal is to be better at those,\nyou want to avoid isolating\nany one particular muscle.\nNow, I know this probably comes across\nas a kind of obvious duh,\nespecially to the folks\nwho have spent a lot of time in the gym\naimed at getting hypertrophy.\nBut I think most people don't appreciate\nthat it's the nerve to muscle connections\nand the distinction\nbetween isolating nerve\nto muscle connections\nversus distributing the work\nof nerve to muscle connections,\nthat's vital in determining whether or not\nyou generate hypertrophy isolated nerve\nto muscle contractions versus strength\nand offsetting strength loss\nwhich would be distributed\nnerve to muscle connections.\nIf ever there was an\narea of practical science\nthat was very confused,\nvery controversial,\nand almost combative at times,\nit would be this issue\nof how best to train.\nI suppose the only thing\nthat's even more barbed wire\nof a conversation than that\nis how best to eat for health.\nThose seem to be the two most common areas\nof online battle and the\nscientific literature\nhas a lot to say about\nboth of those things.\nAgain, my sources for\nwhat I'm about to tell you\nare Professor Andy Galpin and colleagues.\nI know there are other\nexcellent people out there\nin the field, but I really trust his work.\nHe does very controlled studies.\nHe spent a lot of time in this space\nand what's really exciting is that\nin just the last three years or so,\nthere's been a tremendous\namount of information\nto come out about the practical\nsteps that one can take\nin order to maximize the benefits\nof resistance exercise of any kind.\nSo I'm going to talk about those\nand I'm going to talk about the research.\nI will provide some links,\na couple of the more\nin-depth tutorials from\nDr. Galpin, as well as some\nof the papers that the\ninformation I'm about\nto tell you stems from.\nThere's a lot of information saying\nthat you need to move\nweights that are 80 to 90%\nof your one rep maximum\nor 70%, or cycle that\nfor three weeks on and then\ngo to more moderate weights.\nThere are a lot of\npaths as some people say\nthere are a lot of ways to\nadd up numbers to get a 100.\nThere's a near infinite number of ways\nto add up different\nnumbers to get to a 100.\nAnd what's very clear now\nfrom all the literature that's transpired\nand especially from the literature\nin this last three years,\nis that once you know roughly\nyour one repetition maximum,\nthe maximum amount of\nweight that you can perform\nan exercise with for one repetition\nin good form, full range of motion,\nthat it's very clear that moving weights\nor using bands or using\nbody weight, for instance\nin the 30% to 80% of one-rep maximum.\nThat is going to be the\nmost beneficial range\nin terms of muscle\nhypertrophy and strength.\nSo muscle growth and strength.\nAnd there will be a bias\nif you're moving weights\nthat are in the 75%, 80% range\nor maybe even going above that 85 and 90%,\nyou're going to bias your improvements\ntowards strength gains.\nThis is true.\nAnd if you use weights that are in the 30%\nof your one-repetition\nmaximum or 40% or 50%\nand doing many more\nrepetitions, of course,\nthen you are biasing towards hypertrophy\nand what some people like\nto call muscle endurance.\nBut that's a little bit\nof a complicated term\nbecause endurance, we almost\nalways think of as relating\nto running or swimming or\nsome long bouts of activity.\nSo 30% to 80% of one-repetition maximums,\nit doesn't really seem to matter\nfor sake of hypertrophy,\nexcept at the far ends\nwhen you're really trying\nto bias for strength.\nNow, it is clear, however\nthat one needs to perform those sets\nto failure where you can't\nperform another repetition\nin good form again or near to failure.\nAnd there's all sorts of\ninteresting nomenclature\nthat's popping up all over the internet.\nSome of which is scientific,\nsome of which is not scientific\nabout how you are supposed to perceive\nhow close you were to failure, et cetera.\nBut there are some very\ninteresting principles\nthat relate to how the\nnerves connect to the muscles\nthat strongly predict\nwhether or not this exercise\nthat you're performing will\nbe beneficial for you or not.\nSo here's how it goes.\nFor individuals that are untrained\nmeaning they have been\ndoing resistance exercise\nfor anywhere from zero,\nprobably out to about two years,\nalthough for some people, it\nmight be zero to one year,\nbut those are the so-called beginners.\nThey're sort of untrained.\nFor those people, the\nkey parameter seems to be\nto perform enough sets of a given exercise\nper muscle per week.\nThe same is also true for\npeople that have been training\nfor one or two years or more.\nWhat differs is how many sets to perform\ndepending on whether or not\nyou're trained or untrained.\nSo let's say you're somebody\nwho's been doing some\nresistance exercise kind of\non and off over the years\nand you decide you want\nto get serious about\nthat for sake of sport\nor offsetting age related\ndeclines in strength,\nthe range of sets to do in\norder to improve strength\nto activate these cascades\nin the muscle ranges anywhere\nfrom two, believe it\nor not to 20 per week.\nAgain, these are sets per week\nand they don't necessarily\nall have to be performed\nin the same weight training session.\nI will talk about numbers of sessions.\nSo it appears that five sets\nper week in this 30% to 80%\nof the one repetition maximum range,\ngetting close to failure,\nor occasionally actually\ngoing to full muscular\nfailure, which isn't really\nfull muscular failure, but the inability\nto generate a contraction of the muscle\nor move the weight in good form.\nI'll go deeper into that in a moment.\nBut about five sets per\nweek is what's required\njust to maintain your muscle.\nSo think about that.\nIf you're somebody who's kind of averse\nto resistance training,\nyou are going to lose\nmuscle size and strength.\nYour metabolism will drop.\nYour posture will get worse.\nEverything in the context of nerve\nto muscle conductivity\nwill get worse over time,\nunless you are generating\nfive sets or more\nof this 30% to 80% of your one\nrepetition maximum per week.\nSo what this means is\nfor the typical person\nwho hasn't done a lot of weight training,\nyou need to do at least\nfive sets per muscle group.\nNow, that's just to maintain.\nAnd then there's this huge range\nthat goes all the way up to 15\nand in some case, 20 sets per week.\nNow, how many sets you\nperform is going to depend\non the intensity of the\nwork that you perform.\nThis is where it gets a\nlittle bit controversial\nbut I think nowadays most people agree\nand Dr. Galpin confirmed\nthat 10% not to be confused\nwith the 10% we discussed\nearlier, but 10% of the sets\nof a given workout or\n10% of workouts overall\nshould be of the high-intensity sort\nwhere one is actually\nworking to muscular failure.\nNow I say not true muscular failure\nbecause in theory you\nhave a concentric movement\nwhich is the kind of\nlifting of the weight,\nand then you have the ecentric portion\nof muscle contraction,\nwhich is the lowering.\nAnd ecentric movements because of the way\nthat muscle fibers lengthen\nand that sliding act myosin\nthat we talked about before,\nyou're always stronger\nin lowering something\nthan you are in lifting it.\nBut the point being that\nmost of your training\nmost of your sets should\nbe not to failure.\nAnd the reason for that is it\nallows you to do more volume\nof work without fatiguing\nthe nervous system\nand depleting the nerve\nto muscle connection\nin ways that are detrimental.\nSo we can make this simple.\nPerform anywhere from 5 to 15 sets\nof resistance exercise per week,\nand that's per muscle, and\nthat's in this 30% to 80%\nof what your one-repetition maximum.\nThat seems to be the most\nscientifically supported way\nof offsetting any decline\nin muscle strength\nif you're working in the\nkind of five set range\nand in increasing muscle strength\nwhen you start to get up\ninto the 10 and 15 set range.\nNow, the caveat to that is everyone varies\nand muscles vary in terms\nof their recover ability.\nDepending on how well you\ncan control the contraction\nof muscles deliberately.\nAnd you can actually figure\nthat out by sort of marching,\nyou might take five minutes\nand just kind of March across your body\nand mentally try and\ncontrol the contractions\nof muscles in a very deliberate way\nto the point where you can\ngenerate a hard contraction.\nAnd you may have to move a limb\nin order to do this, by the way.\nI'm not talking about just\nmentally contracting your bicep\nwithout moving your wrist.\nI'm talking about doing\nthat without any weight\nin hand or any band or any resistance.\nIf you can generate a\nhigh intensity contraction\nusing these upper motor neuron\nto lower motor neuron pathways to muscle,\nyou might think, well I\nshould perform many more sets.\nBut actually, the opposite is true.\nIf you can generate high-intensity\nmuscular contractions\nusing your brain, using your neurons,\nit will take fewer sets in\norder to stimulate the muscle\nto maintain itself and\nto stimulate the muscle\nin order to grow or get stronger.\nSo the more efficient you are\nin recruiting motor units,\nremember, Henneman's size principle\nthe recruit men have more motor units\nwhich isn't just muscles,\nit's nerve to muscle connections.\nThe better you are at doing that, the more\nyou will recruit these so-called\nhigh threshold motor units\nthe ones that are hard to get to,\nthe more you will kick\noff the cascades of things\nwithin muscle that stimulate\nmuscle growth and strength.\nSo if you have muscles that\nare challenging to contract,\nit's going to take more sets\nin order to stimulate the desired effect\nin those muscles not fewer.\nIf you have muscles that you are very good\nat generating force within,\nit's going to take fewer sets.\nNow, how many sets you are\ngoing to have to determine that\nit's going to depend for\nthose of you that are using\nlike 50% of your one-repetition maximum,\nbecause you're doing a lot of repetitions,\nyou might find that\nthree or four, five sets\nwill maintain the muscle.\nYou might decide to do that once\nat one point in the week\nand then do it again.\nSo if you're going for 10 sets a week\nyou can divide that among two sessions.\nYou could do that all in one session.\nThe data really show it doesn't matter.\nThere are some differences in terms of\nwhether or not you're trying\nto generate maximum intensity\nwithin a workout or whether or not\nyou want to spread that out.\nBut in general, resistance workouts\nof any kind tend to be best favored\nby workouts that are somewhere\nbetween 45 minutes and 60 minutes.\nAnd generally not longer than 60 minutes\nbecause that's when all\nthe things like cortisol\nand some of the inflammatory\npathways really start\nto create a situation in\nthe muscle and in the body\nthat's not so great for you.\nSo it's not a hard and fast rule.\nThe ax doesn't drop at 60 minutes\nbut it's pretty clear\nthat performing this five\nto 15 sets per week, whether\nor not it's in one workout\nor whether that's divided\nup across multiple workouts\nis really what's going\nto be most beneficial.\nAnd please do keep in mind\nHenneman's size principle\nand the recruitment of motor units.\nAnd remember the better you are\nat contracting particular muscles\nin an isolating those muscles,\nthe fewer sets likely you need to do\nin order to get the desired effect.\nNow, what about people who\nhave been training for a while?\nIf you're somebody who's been doing\nweight training for a while,\nthe data points to the fact\nthat more volume can be\nbeneficial, even for muscles\nthat you are very\nefficient at contracting.\nNow, the curve on this, the graph on this\nbegins again at about five sets per week\nfor maintaining a given muscle group,\nand extends all the way out\nto 25 or 30 sets per week.\nHowever, there are individuals\nwho for whatever reason\ncan generate so much force.\nThey're so good at training muscles\nthat they can generate so\nmuch force in just four\nor six or eight sets that\ndoing this large volume\nof work is actually going\nto be counterproductive.\nSo everyone needs to\nfigure out for themselves.\nFirst of all, how often you're willing\nto do resistance exercise of any kind.\nAnd again, it doesn't\nmatter if you're using bands\nor weights or body weight.\nFor instance, if you're\ndoing chin-ups chances are\nunless you are very strong\nthat you're not using weights.\nYou're just using something\nthat you can hold onto.\nOr if you're doing pushups,\nsome of you will be working\nin that 30% to 80% of your\none-repetition maximum range.\nIt doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you have to be moving\nweights in a gym for instance.\nSo the purpose here is to figure out\nwhat muscles you're trying to train.\nThat's an issue that we'll\ntalk about in a moment.\nAnd then it does appear that somewhere\nbetween five and 15 sets\nper week is going to be\nthe thing that's going\nto work for most people.\nNow, this is based on a\ntremendous amount of work\nthat was done by Andy\nGalpin and colleagues,\nBrad Schoenfeld and colleagues\nand others, Mike Roberts.\nThere's a huge group of people\nout there doing exercise\nphysiology and a small subset\nof them that are linking them\nback to real-world protocols\nthat don't just pertain to athletes.\nSo that's mainly what\nI'm focusing on today.\nAnd surely there will be exceptions.\nNow, if you are going to\ndivide the sets across the week\nyou're not going to do\nall 10 sets for instance\nfor a given muscle group in one session,\nthen of course, it's imperative\nthat the muscles recover\nin between sessions.\nAnd we are going to talk about recovery\nboth at the systemic level,\nthe whole nervous system\nand at the local level the nerve to muscle\nand local even muscle level.\nWe'll talk about that in about 10 minutes\nwhen we talk about recovery.\nI do want to mention\nsomething very important\nwhich is that everything\nI'm referring to here\nit has to do with full range of motion.\nAnd you might ask, well, what\nabout the speeds of movements?\nThis is actually turns out\nto be a really interesting dataset\nfor generating explosiveness and speed.\nSo for sprinters or throwing sports,\nor for people that want to\ngenerate a lot of jumping power,\nit does appear that\nlearning to move weights\nas fast as you safely can,\nespecially under moderate\nto heavy loads, can increase\nexplosiveness and speed.\nAnd most of that effect is\nfrom changes in the neurons.\nIt's not from changes in the muscle.\nIt's from changes in the way\nthat the upper motor neurons\ncommunicate with the lower motor neurons\nand generating a pathway, a\nneural circuit, as we call it,\nthat is very efficient at\ngenerating action potentials,\nwhich are the electricity within neurons\nto trigger the muscle.\nNow, of course there\nare events that happen\nfrom nerve to muscle\nbut the takeaway from that\nenormous literature, frankly\nis that if you want to get faster,\nyes, it can be beneficial to get stronger.\nBut if you want to dedicate\nresistance training specifically\nto jumping higher, to running\nfaster, to throwing further\nand these sorts of things that\nlearning to generate force\nwith increasing speed is\ngoing to be beneficial.\nOn the flip side of that\nfor people that want to get stronger,\nit appears that the\nslowing down of the weight\nas things get harder is a key parameter\nin recruiting those high\nthreshold motor units.\nSo let me phrase that a\nlittle bit differently.\nThink about a set in the gym\nor think about a set of\npushups or a set of pull-ups.\nInitially you can move\nvery fast if you like.\nIf you want to generate hypertrophy,\nthe goal really is not\nnecessarily to move super slow\nbut to isolate the muscle\nand therefore not to use momentum rather\nthan lift weights, as they\nsay, challenge muscles.\nIf you want to get stronger,\nyou're going to be\ndistributing that effort\nover more muscles and more\nof your nervous system.\nFor generating explosiveness and speed,\nit's very clear that learning\nto generate forces quickly\nand to move heavy or\nmoderately heavy loads quickly\nis going to be beneficial\nbecause of the way\nthat you train the motor neurons.\nAnd of course changes in the muscle.\nBut this could look different\nfor different sports.\nAnd obviously you want\nto make safety paramount.\nIf you're injured, you're\nnot going to be able\nto train at all for sport\nor for any purpose that is.\nAnd so what this would involve\nis something like 60% to 75%\nof a one-repetition maximum,\nand then in a controlled way\nmoving that as quickly as one\ncan throughout the entire set.\nAnd certainly not going to failure\nbecause as you approach failure,\nthe inability to move the\nweight with good form,\nthe weight inevitably slows down.\nIn fact, there are a lot\nof new technologies now\nthat are focused on informing people\nof how quickly the bar\nor weight is moving.\nI saw an advertisement\nfor this the other day.\nThere are things that\npeople can attach to bars\nthat will literally speak to you\nas you're doing a set and inform you\nwhether or not you're moving\nfour times more slowly per rep\nthan you were at the beginning.\nAnd trying to hone in on\nthe exact speed of movement.\nIn talking to these experts\nprior to this episode\nit does appear that for\nsake of hypertrophy,\nas long as you're not\nmoving the muscle so quickly\nthat you start to distribute the effort\nto lots of other muscles,\nit doesn't really matter\nbecause as the set gets harder,\nthe motor units that you\nrecruit will increase the number\nof neurons that you recruit\nand the number of muscle\nfibers and particularly\nthese high threshold muscle\nfibers will increase.\nAnd so it's really only\nfor purposes of hypertrophy\nthat you really need to be concerned about\nhow quickly the weight is slowing down.\nHowever, if you're trying to\nget faster, more explosive\nand generate more speed and\njumping power, throwing power\nthings of that sort, you never\nreally want to use a weight\nor get to a portion of the set\nwhere you're moving the\nbar very, very slowly.\nAnd I'm sure as I say that some\nof the exercise physiologists\nand advanced trainers out there will come\nafter me with pitchforks, which is fine.\nI'd love to see the literature that shows\nthat low gear slow movements\nwith very heavy weights\ncan indeed improve explosiveness.\nAnd that may in fact be the case,\nbut the data that I was able\nto access was essentially\nas I described just a moment ago.\nSo as you're probably\nstarting to realize you need\nto customize a resistance practice\nfor your particular needs and goals.\nAnd I certainly am not\nthe first to suggest\nthat people periodize their training.\nThat they do things from anywhere\nfrom one month to six months,\nand to see how it goes\nand to make modifications as they go.\nBecause the nervous system in particular\nthe neuromuscular system\nchanges very quickly\nat the beginning of training.\nIn fact, some of the\nchanges that one can see\nwhen they first embrace or\nstart resistance training\ncan be very remarkable, but\nthey tend to slow over time.\nSo we've talked about a few principles.\nThe fact that you need\nto get sufficient volume,\nyou need at least five sets to maintain\nand you probably need about\n10 sets per muscle group\nin order to improve muscle.\nThat moving weights of moderate\nto moderately heavy weight quickly\nis going to be best for explosiveness.\nThe isolating muscles and\nreally contracting muscles hard\nsomething that you can test by just\nwhen you're outside the training session,\nseeing whether or not you\ncan cramp the muscle hard\nwill tell you your capacity\nto improve hypertrophy\nor to engage strength\nchanges in that muscle.\nThat your ability to\ncontract a muscle hard is\ninversely related to the number\nof sets that you should do\nin order to isolate and\nstimulate that muscle.\nAnd there are some other\nthings that can enhance\nthe whole process of building\nnerve to muscle connections,\nmaking them more efficient\nand generating if you like\nmore strength and hypertrophy.\nOne of them I loath to say I was told\nis in between set contractions.\nThe other name for this is the people\nin the gym does typically\nseem to be guys in the gym\nflexing their muscles in between sets.\nAnd indeed the research supports the fact\nthat contractions have about 30 seconds\nin between the actual work sets,\nthey're not going to\nfavor better performance\non the work sets, if anything\nthey're going to compromise them.\nBut those hard contractions\nin between sets\nfor a variety of reasons related\nto local muscle metabolism\nas well as what we talked about before\nwhich are stress, tension, and damage,\nthey seem to improve\nstress, tension, and damage\nand the nerve to muscle contraction\nin ways that facilitate hypertrophy.\nIn other words, if you\nsee that person flexing\nin between sets in the gym,\nprovided that they're\nreally isolating that muscle\nand provided it's one that\nthey ought to be improving,\nnot one of these people\nthat always skips leg day type of people.\nThese people are highly asymmetric\nalthough that's up to them,\nthat process of flexing\nin between sets does seem\nto improve the nerve to muscle connection\nand enhance hypertrophy.\nAnd I say I was low to say it\nbecause nowadays with phones\nit seems like the end of\nevery set includes a selfie\nsort of like the 11th rep of every set.\nI like to joke.\nIt seems like very few people\nare capable of actually going\ninto the gym and doing a workout\nwithout taking a picture of themselves,\nwhich I think is fine\nif that's your thing.\nAlthough I must say that\nthe athletes that I know\nand even the recreational\nathletes that I know\nwho seem to get the most\nout of their training\nand who also seem to get the most out\nof other aspects of their life,\nseem to be able to control\ntheir phone behavior\nboth in the gym and outside of the gym.\nBut that's more of an\neditorial point there.\nIn an earlier episode,\nI talked about estrogen and testosterone.\nAnd during that discussion, I talked about\nthe use of resistance\nexercise specifically\nfor increasing testosterone,\nboth in men and in women.\nAnd indeed that is a powerful\neffect of resistance exercise.\nAnd indeed it's mediated by the\nnerve to muscle connections.\nWe talked about that in\nthat earlier episode.\nI just want to briefly\nmention that protocol\nsince it's distinctly different\nfrom the other protocols\nI've talked about today.\nThe protocols I've talked\nabout today thus far\nof explosive movements or of\nhypertrophy-based training\nprovided the training\nis 60 minutes or less\nwill cause increases in serum testosterone\nthat's been shown over and over again.\nAnd if the session extends\ntoo long, past 75 minutes\nand is of sufficiently\nhigh intensity chances are\ntestosterone levels will start to drop\nand cortisol levels will go up\nin ways that can be\ndetrimental to recovery\nand the goals of the training.\nBut that's different than training\nthat's specifically geared\ntoward increasing testosterone.\nDuncan French, who's one of the directors\nof the UFC Performance Center,\nwhen he was a graduate student\nat University of Connecticut\nStores did some beautiful work.\nHe and his colleagues found\nthe ideal training protocols\nfor stimulating testosterone release\nwhich is something that\nmany people want to do\nfor a variety of reasons.\nAnd that involved doing\nsix sets of 10 repetitions\neven if it requires lightening the weight\non one set to the next,\nwith about two minutes\n120 seconds rest in between sets.\nWhich if you think of about\nit is pretty short rest\nand is pretty darn hard work.\nNow, what's interesting is that\nthere's a very limited threshold\nfor increasing testosterone.\nThat protocol of six sets\nof 10 repetitions led\nto these big increases\nin serum testosterone.\nBut if people did 10 sets of 10\nso just four more repetitions per set,\nthen testosterone did not increase.\nIn fact, you got more of this\ncatabolic cortisol like pathway.\nYou get other benefits from this\nso-called 10 sets of 10 protocol,\nbut not the testosterone increase\nand maybe even reductions in testosterone.\nNow, it's important to point out that\nthat six sets of 10 was done\nwith big compound movements.\nSo things like squats,\nor deadlifts, or chin-ups\nor things of that sort.\nAnd those were done as single sessions\nnot in concert with a bunch\nof other exercise, although\nif athletes are doing\nthat, there's no reason\nwhy they couldn't also do other types\nof training elsewhere in the week.\nI asked Duncan about this\nand he mentioned that\nthat done twice a week\nis probably the maximum\nthat anyone could do that\nand still maintain this\nincrease in testosterone.\nIt's a very interesting protocol\nbecause as a neuroscientist, it's amazing\nto me that six sets of 10\nrepetitions with something,\ncauses a distinctly different result\nin terms of hormone output\nthan 10 sets of 10 of\nthe exact same movement.\nAnd it speaks to the\nexquisite way in which nerve\nto muscle connections\ndictate the whole physiology\nof your entire system.\nIf there's a theme that I really\nwant to bring forward today\nis that weight training or\nresistance training of any kind\nis really used for\neither systemic effects.\n10% of training done where\nyou're feeling that burn\nwhich means lactate will be present\nand sending signals to your brain,\nand your heart and your\nliver that are beneficial\nor isolating muscles\nwhich may also generate\na kind of a lactate which is\nassociated with the burn result\nbut that isolation of\nmuscles distinctly different.\nSo systemic versus isolated.\nThose are the two general ways\nin which resistance\ntraining can be applied.\nSo I just wanted to mention\nthat earlier protocol\nbecause it's well supported\nby the literature.\nIf you were to incorporate that protocol,\nyou might ask, well, then can you do any\nother weight training during the week?\nAnd sure, of course you can\nprovided you're recovering.\nSo let's talk about how you\nknow if you're recovering.\nHow you know if a muscle is recovered\nand how you know if your\nwhole system is recovered.\nBecause recovery is what\ndictates whether or not\nyou can come back and do more\nwork of a different kind.\nMeaning, I don't know, you\ndo a leg training one day,\ncan you and should you come back\nand do the upper body training day?\nAnd it dictates whether or\nnot you'll see any improvement\nfrom session to session at all.\nBefore I talk about recovery\nI just want to make sure\nI nailed down the details\nthat I was able to extract\nfrom the literature\nand from my conversation with Dr. Galpin.\nIf you're wondering how\nquickly to perform repetitions\nfor sake of hypertrophy or strength gains,\nanywhere from a half a\nsecond per repetition\nall the way up to eight\nseconds per repetition,\nit doesn't seem to matter.\nAgain, if you're thinking\nabout explosiveness\nor building speed, or you're specifically\nusing resistance training\nto build endurance,\nthat's a separate matter.\nWe talked about explosiveness and speed.\nI'll talk about endurance\nin a few moments.\nWe also talked about in\nbetween set contractions\nthe so called selfie effect\nof people flexing a particular muscle,\nisolating a particular\nmuscle between sets,\njust want to mention that\nwould be a terrible thing to do\nif your goal is performance on sets.\nSo moving a particular amount of weight.\nThat's actually going to\ndiminish the amount of weight\nthat you can move.\nIt's going to enhance muscle growth\nand it's going to enhance the nerve\nto muscle isolation of\nthat particular pathway.\nSo again, that flexing\nbetween sets is going\nto favor hypertrophy, not performance.\nIf you're trying to get stronger,\nyou're trying to move more weights,\nyou're trying to distribute work,\nand you're trying to\ndo maybe skill training\nwith resistance then flexing between sets\nis absolutely the wrong thing\nto do for obvious reasons\nyou're fatiguing the muscle further.\nJust remaining still or\nwalking around a little bit\nhas been shown to be beneficial in terms\nof moving some of the\nlactate out of the muscle\nas well as just recovering between sets.\nNow, how long to recover\nbetween sets, is a question.\nFor the testosterone protocol,\nDuncan French and colleagues\nfound that it was about\ntwo minutes keeping\nthat really on the clock,\ntwo minutes not longer.\nFor hypertrophy and for strength gains,\nit does seem that resting\nanywhere from two minutes\nor even three or four,\neven five or six minutes\ncan be beneficial.\nAnd if you're interested\nin expanding the volume\nof work that you can do in a given session\nat high capacity at high\nintensity, with a given weight,\nplease see the episode that I did\non cold and performance about\nsupercharging performance\nwhich is based on the work of my colleague\nCraig Heller in the Biology\nDepartment at Stanford,\nwhich talks about Palmer Cooling,\nabout how you can cool\nthe core of the body best\nthrough the palms using these\nparticular venous portals\nthat are only present in your hands.\nPeople are now doing this with\nice packs or with gel packs.\nThere are a number of\ndifferent ways one can do this.\nI talk all about that in that episode.\nIt allows you to do more repetitions\nand more work at a given weight over time.\nSo rather than getting 10 repetitions\nand then eight and then seven and then six\nthrough proper use of palmer cooling,\none can do 10, 10, 10,\n10, and even add sets.\nAnd that's one way that one can accomplish\nhigher volume work without having\nto drop the weight considerably.\nSo that's where you can\nhit that really sweet spot\nif that's your goal of getting strong\nand generating some hypertrophy.\nBecause as soon as you have\nto drop to lighter weights,\nthen you're shifting\nmore towards hypertrophy\nand endurance and less toward\nstrength of any given muscle.\nSo check out that episode.\nThe last thing besides\nbetween set contractions\nand whether or not\nyou're distributing work\nor whether or not you're really\ntrying to isolate muscles\nis this notion of pre-exhausting muscles.\nIt's been shown over and over again\nthat for instance, if you\nwant to generate force\nin a given muscle and really isolate that,\ndoing the isolation work\nbefore a compound movement.\nSo this would be leg extensions\nthe thing where you sit\nand you extend your toes\nup toward the ceiling.\nLeg extensions before\nsquats will allow the squats\nto target that muscle\ngroup more effectively.\nAnd that makes perfectly\ngood sense based on\nthe Henneman's size principle\nand fatiguing motor units.\nIt should be obvious why that's the case.\nBut of course that's going\nto be anti performance\nin terms of how much weight you can lift,\nand maybe even the form\nthat you can maintain\nwhen you move to the\nbigger compound movement.\nSo you really have to ask\nyourself a number of questions.\nHow good are you at\nisolating a given muscle?\nTherefore, how many\nsets do you want to do?\nHow often are you willing to train\ntherefore, how many\nsets are you going to do\nin a given session versus\nhow many are you going\nto distribute across the week?\nAre you aiming for performance?\nAre you going to distribute that work\nacross the nervous system and musculature?\nAre you trying to move weights?\nAre you trying to challenge muscles?\nIf you're trying to challenge muscles,\nthen you really want to focus on things\nlike this pre exhausting the isolation\nof a muscle before the compound movement.\nYour performance on compound movements\nwill absolutely suffer but your ability\nto isolate that muscle\nand generate hypertrophy\nthrough the accumulation of larger myosin,\nthose bigger balloons, will benefit.\nAnd once again, if you're\ntrying to get faster\nthan the speed of the\nmovement really matters.\nSo how do we know if we've recovered?\nHow can we test recovery?\nAnd this is not just recovery\nfrom resistance training,\nthis is recovery from running,\nrecovery from swimming.\nUp until now I've been talking\nabout resistance training\nmore or less in a vacuum.\nI haven't even touched on the fact\nthat many people are running\nand they're doing resistance training\nor they're swimming and they're\ndoing resistance training.\nIt's not simply the case that\nif a given muscle is fatigued\nyou can just work other muscles.\nBecause even if you've\nbeautifully isolated a muscle,\nlet's say you have incredible abilities\nto isolate just your\nquadriceps for instance\nand you do a workout where\nyou isolate your quadriceps\nyou do your six sets of intense work\nor maybe use palmer cooling,\nand you're able to do\n12 sets of intense work\nand you're done, and that muscle group\nthe next day is certainly\nnot going to be recovered\nunless you're somebody who's\nextraordinary at recovery\nor you're enhancing your\nrecovery through chemical means\nwhich we'll talk about at the end.\nWell, you can assess systemic recovery\nmeaning your nervous system.\nAnd your nervous system's\nability to generate force\nboth distributed and isolated\nthrough three main tests.\nAnd fortunately, these\ntests are very simple\nand two of them are essentially zero cost,\nrequire no equipment.\nHRV, heart rate variability\nhas made its way finally\ninto the forefront of exercise physiology\nand even into the popular discussion.\nI've talked about HRV before.\nHow when we exhale, our\nheart rate slows down\nbecause of the way that our diaphragm\nis connected to our heart and to our brain\nand the way our brain is\nconnected to our heart.\nWhen we inhale our heart rate speeds up\nand that is the basis of\nheart rate variability.\nHeart rate variability is good.\nIt means that you're breathing properly,\nand when I say it's good it means\nyou want a lot of heart rate variability.\nYou don't want a heart rate that is high\nor low consistently over time.\nThat might come as a bit\nof a surprise for you\nendurance athletes,\nwho probably are trying\nto accomplish your endurance\nwork at a steady cadence\nto really hit that nice sweet spot\nwhere you're breathing rhythmically,\nyour heart rate's going rhythmically.\nYou're in that steady heart rate,\nand then away from exercise,\nyou have a nice low\nheart rate as they say.\nWell, nice low heart rate isn't\nnecessarily always so nice.\nTurns out the introducing bouts\nof increasing your heart\nrate during exercise\nand even through your waking day,\nthrough stressful events\neven is provided their brief\nis beneficial.\nA good nerve to heart system benefits\nfrom being able to increase heart rate\nand decrease heart rate.\nHeart rate variability is good.\nSo you don't want high heart rate,\nyou don't want low\nheart rate all the time.\nBut heart rate variability is difficult\nfor a lot of people to measure.\nThere are some devices that\nwill allow you to do that.\nVarious watches and devices.\nThere are more devices becoming\navailable all the time.\nHopefully soon, some that are integrated\nwith your phone that involve no contact\nor anything on your body.\nBut those do carry some costs\nand they are not perfect yet.\nThe measures of heart rate\nvariability that one can use\nwhile in movement are still in that phase\nI would say of technology development\nwhere everyone isn't using\nthem, let's leave it at that.\nThere are two measures however,\nwhether or not you\nrecovered that you can use\nfirst thing in the\nmorning when you wake up,\nmaybe after five, 10 minutes, if you like,\nbut ideally right when you wake up\nin order to assess how\nwell recovered you are\nand therefore whether\nor not you should train\nyour whole system at all that day.\nThe first one his grip strength.\nGrip strength, the\nability to generate force\nat the level of squeezing the fist\nor squeezing down on something,\nmight seem like kind of a trivial way\nto assess recovery but\nit's not because it relates\nto your ability to use\nyour upper motor neurons\nto control your lower motor neurons\nand to generate isolated force.\nSo that's really what you're\nassessing when you do that.\nSome people will use\none of these grip tools\nor Costello has this toy\nthat's shaped like a donut\nand it's this hard rubber.\nAnd I've tried this before.\nIf I've been working really\nhard, not sleeping very well,\nor I've been training a lot\nany one or combination of\nthose things, my grip suffers.\nI can't actually squeeze that thing down\nas much as I can Costello\nbecause he was born\nwith like a 24 inch neck\neven though he's never touched a weight\nsomehow he can just\nclamp down on that thing,\nand he can turn it into\na pancake with ease\nand he likes to chuckle while\nI struggle with this thing.\nBut on a good day, I\ncan squeeze this thing\nso that I eliminate the hole\nin the donut so to speak.\nYou can also take a floor\nscale and squeeze the scale\nand see how much force you can generate.\nI would do that as a baseline to establish\nwhat you can do when you're well rested.\nAnd then if you do that in the morning,\nyou can see whether or not you're able\nto generate the same amount of force\nor you could use over the\nrubber donut or something.\nA lot of this is very subjective\nwith a scale you're\nreally trying to assess\nwhether or not you can generate\nthe same amount of force.\nIf you start seeing a 10% or\n20% certainly reduction in that\nthat's concerning, it\nmeans that your system,\nyour nervous system as a whole\nit's not necessarily\nfatigued, is that the pathways\nfrom nerve to muscle\nare still in the process\nof rewiring themselves in\norder to generate force.\nAnd you might think, well, I\ntrain one muscle group one day.\nWhy am I having a hard time doing this\nfor a completely different muscle group?\nIt doesn't make any sense.\nBut there's something about\nthe upper motor neuron\nto lower motor neuron pathway generally\nthat allows you to use\nsomething like grip strength\nas a kind of a thermometer, if you will\nof your ability to recover.\nSo look for your ability\nto generate force in grip\nwhen you first wake up.\nIt's not going to be as\ngood as it is at 3:00 PM\nafter a cup of coffee and a couple meals\nbut the point isn't performance overall,\nthe point is to assess whether or not\nyou're getting better, worse\nor the same from day to day.\nThe other one that's really terrific\nand the Andy Galpin's group is using.\nAnd I'm delighted about\nthis because it relates\nto something that my lab is\nvery excited about as well\nis carbon dioxide tolerance.\nSo this is a really interesting tool\nthat endurance athletes, strength athletes\nI think can all benefit from.\nIn fact athletes and people of all kinds.\nEven if you're not an athlete,\neven if you're not exercising at all,\nthere's a good question of\nwhether or not your system\nas a whole is doing okay or not.\nWe rely on the thermometer.\nDo we have a fever or not?\nWe rely on subjective things.\nDo I feel good or not?\nAm I digesting well or not?\nThose are all subjective.\nThe carbon dioxide tolerance test is,\nits objective in that it\nmeasures your capacity\nto engage the so-called\nparasympathetic arm\nof your nervous system\nwhich is the calming aspect\nof your nervous system.\nAnd it measures your ability\nto consciously control\na particular skeletal muscle,\nwhich is your diaphragm.\nSo here's how you do the\ncarbon dioxide tolerance test.\nYou wake up in the morning.\nIf you have to use the\nrestroom first, do that,\nbut try and stay away from your phone.\nIf you have your phone,\nput it on airplane mode,\ngo to the timer or use a\nhand watch or some other way\nof measuring time, stay off social media\nfor just a few seconds.\nIt'll be okay.\nAnd what you're going to do\nis you're going to inhale\nthrough your nose as deeply as you can,\nyou can do this lying\ndown, sitting, whatever\ninhale through your nose\nand then exhale all the way.\nSo that's one.\nYou're going to repeat that four times.\nSo inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale four times.\nAnd ideally you're\ninhaling through the nose\nand you're exhaling through the mouth.\nThat's just the beginning\nof this carbon dioxide tolerance test.\nThen you take a fifth inhale\nas deep as you can through your nose.\nFill your lungs as much as you can,\nand if you can try and expand\nmake your stomach go\nout while you do that,\nthat means that your\ndiaphragm has really engaged.\nSo you're inhaling as\nmuch as you possibly can.\nThen hit the timer and\nyour goal is to release\nthat air as slowly as\npossible through your mouth.\nSo it looks like you have\na tiny, tiny little straw\nin your mouth and you're letting it go.\nAs slowly as you possibly can.\nMeasure what we call the\ncarbon dioxide blow off time\nor discard rate.\nI know you can all sit with lungs empty\nafter you eliminate all that\nair, but don't lie to yourself.\nDon't stop the timer\nwhen you've been sitting\nwith your lungs empty for a while,\nstop the timer when you\nare finally no longer\nable to exhale any more air.\nSo you do inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,\ninhale, exhale, inhale, exhale slowly.\nI just said it quickly for sake of time\nthen you can do this fifth\nbig inhale through your mouth,\nand then [deep exhale]\nAnd I'm not going to do\nit for the full duration.\nAnd then you're measuring that time.\nYour carbon dioxide discard\nrate will be somewhere\nbetween one second and\npresumably two minutes.\nTwo minutes would be a heroic\ncarbon oxide discard time.\n30 seconds would be more typical.\n20 seconds would be fast.\nIf your carbon dioxide discard time\nis 20 or 25 seconds or less,\nyou are not necessarily recovered\nfrom your previous days activities.\nThere's ways to push through this\nbut hold onto that thought for a moment.\nIf your carbon oxide\ndiscard time is somewhere\nbetween about 30 seconds and 60 seconds,\nyou are in what we would\ncall kind of the green zone\nwhere you are in a position\nto do more physical work.\nAnd if your carbon dioxide\ndiscard time is somewhere\nbetween 65 and 120 seconds,\nwell then you have almost certainly\nrecovered your nervous system.\nI'm not talking about\nthe individual muscles\nbut your nervous system is\nprepared to do more work.\nAnd Andy's Lab has great data on this\nas it relates to exercise physiology.\nI think that story should be out\nin the not too distant future.\nMy lab has been using\ncarbon oxide discard time\nto look at anxiety and\nrecovery from bouts of anxiety.\nSo two totally independent projects\nbut using the same measure.\nSo you've got HRV, which\nrequires some technology usually.\nYou've got grip strength,\nwhich you can assess subjectively\nor you can use a floor scale\nand now you have carbon dioxide tolerance.\nYou want to do this in the\nmorning when you wake up\nand keep track just write\ndown in a little book,\nor maybe just keep tracking your mind\nof your carbon oxide discard time.\nIf you find that your\ndiscard times are dropping\neven if they're in the\n42nd range or 52nd range,\nbut normally you can do\n75 seconds or 120 seconds.\nIf they're starting to drop\nby anywhere from 15% to 20%,\nyou're veering in the\ndirection of not recovering.\nAnd I'm really keen on this tool\nbecause everybody has\ndifferent recovery abilities.\nSome people are eating really\nwell and sleeping really well.\nSome people have minimal stress\nor can buffer stress really well.\nOther people they dissolve\ninto a puddle of tears\nif they read one text message\nthat's troubling or whatever.\nAnd I realize, and I\nsay that with sympathy,\nI realize people have\nvarying levels of stress\nand demand in their life.\nIt's just to to prescribe\nan entire protocol\nthat says, okay, yes\nyou should train today\nand this is exactly what you should do.\nNo, you shouldn't.\nUse carbon dioxide discard rate because a,\nit's valuable, it's informative.\nb, it's zero cost and c,\nit's something you can\ntrack objectively over time.\nAnd that's really the key.\nAnd I'd be remiss if I didn't say\nthat what carbon dioxide\ndiscard rate is tapping into\nis your ability to mechanically\ncontrol your diaphragm\ncertainly that's one aspect of it,\nbut that relates in a very\ndirect way to your ability\nto put the brake on your stress system.\nTo engage the so-called parasympathetic\nor calming arm of your\nautonomic nervous system.\nAnd another thing that Andy\nGalpin's group is testing\nis at the offset of\ntraining after your run,\nafter your weight training session,\nmaybe even after your plyometrics session,\nwe didn't really talk\nabout jumping and throwing\nand that sort of thing.\nMaybe we'll talk about\nit in a future episode.\nBut they and other groups,\nincluding some elite athletes\nand other groups that are very interested\nin physical performance are using a tool\nwhere they deliberately disengaged\nfor five minutes at the end of training.\nThey deliberately engage this\ncalming or parasympathetic arm\nof the nervous system.\nAnd you can do that through\nany number of different tools.\nI'm a big fan of respiration tools\n'cause they're always available to you.\nYour breathing is always there.\nI talk about some of these\ntools in previous episodes\nbut you could use things like\nnon sleep deep rest and SDR\nat the end of a training session.\nYou could do 10 physiological size,\ndouble inhales through the\nnose followed by long exhales,\nthat will definitely engage the\nparasympathetic nervous\nsystem at the end of training.\nSo rather than finish\nyour training session\nand then just hop onto your phone,\nserious athletes and people\nwho are serious about recovery\ninitiate that recovery at the\nvery end of their training\nand they start to kickstart\nthat recovery process rather\nand they measure CO2\ntolerance in the morning.\nSo there are several\ngroups that are doing that.\nIn fact, I know several\ngroups because I'm working\nwith them that are using\nphysiological size between sets\nin order to recover their nervous system\nand maintain nerve to\nmuscle contractibility.\nMaintain focus throughout\ntheir training session\nenhance their focus by doing\na few physiological size.\nSo double inhale, exhale in between sets.\nSo they're getting very\nfocused and very intense\nabout their strength work\nor explosiveness worker,\nmuscle isolation work during their sets.\nAnd then in between sets,\nthey're deliberately\ndisengaging the nervous system,\nand then they're re-engaging it again.\nSo I just wanted to emphasize that.\nSo recovery is a complex process.\nIt's got a lot of things\nbut the CO2 tolerance set\nshould be a valuable tool.\nNow, another tool for recovery\nthat people are very excited about\nis the use of cold and the ice bath.\nAnd this is important.\nIf you are somebody who uses\ncold through cold shower,\nor ice bath, or jumping\nin a lake, or a river\nwhatever it is that used to generate cold\nas a recovery tool, you should be aware\nthat there are data\nstarting to emerge that\nif your goal is recovery\nor strength improvements,\nusing cold within the four\nhours following a workout.\nI'm not talking about\npalmer cooling, I'm talking\nabout whole body cooling or\ncooling from the neck down.\nYes, it will reduce inflammation.\nYes, it will reduce the amount\nof delayed on muscle soreness one readout\nof how intense or damaging\na given workout was\nnot the only readout,\nbut it does seem to interfere with some\nof the things like mTOR pathways,\nthe mammalian target of rapamycin pathway\nand other pathways\nrelated to an inflammation\nthat promote muscle\nrepair and muscle growth.\nRemember, stress, tension, and damage\nor the stimulus for nerve to\nmuscle connections to change\nand for muscles to get\nbigger, stronger, and better.\nAnd so if you're getting into\nthe ice bath after training\nor taking a really cold shower\nafter doing resistance training,\nyou are likely short-circuiting\nthe improvements\nthat you're trying to create.\nNow, athletes who are\ntrying to recover quickly\nso that they can get back\ninto more training sessions,\nor let's say you're\nsomebody who doesn't really\nwant to gain much strength or hypertrophy\nand you're mainly focused on endurance\nand you want to do more endurance work\nand you've been weight training,\nwell then exposing yourself\nto cold can be beneficial,\nbut you're not going to\nget as great of benefits\nfrom the resistance training.\nIn other words, cold\nafter resistance training\nseems to short circuit\nsome of the benefits\nof that resistance training.\nThere are some other things\nthat can short circuit the benefits\nof resistance training as well.\nOne of those is anti-histamines.\nSome interesting data\nwere published recently.\nI believe it was in\nscientific reports, yes\nthat showed that\nanti-histamines can prevent some\nof the benefits of cardiovascular exercise\nof endurance type work\nas running, swimming\nof fairly long duration\nor even sprint type work,\nas well as inhibit some of\nthe processes associated\nwith resistance training.\nRemember, it resistance\ntraining or endurance training,\nthat's a stimulus for stress\nand the adaptation to that\nstress is how you get better.\nThat you can run further, faster,\nlift more weight, hypertrophy\nthe muscle, et cetera.\nSo anti-histamines can be a problem.\nObviously don't compromise your ability\nto breathe completely, but\nanti-histamines generally work\nby blocking what are called\nmast cells and M-A-S-T.\nMast cells are really interesting cells\nthat we'll talk about in our\nmonth on neuro immune function.\nThey travel in the bloodstream\nand these little packets that burst open\nit sites of inflammation.\nMuscle damage and inflammation is a signal\nthat something needs to change.\nAnd so taking it to histamines\nit appears can disrupt\nsome of that inflammatory process.\nSo you actually want inflammation\nduring and immediately after a workout,\nthen you want to bring\ninflammation down later\nand I'll mention how to do that.\nThe other thing are non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory drugs\nyou know their trade names.\nThese are painkillers\nthat many people take.\nThose as I've mentioned\nin a previous episode\ncan interfere with the\nbenefits of endurance training\nand the benefits of resistance training.\nIn addition to that,\nthey block pain signals\nand pain is a very good signal\nthat you might be doing something wrong.\nAnd so while nobody likes to be in pain,\nI suppose there are probably\na few people out there\nlike to be in pain, but\nthat's a different story\nbut nobody likes to be in pain.\nThe non-steroid\nanti-inflammatory the NSAIDs\nas they're called, and\nthe anti-histamines seem\nto prevent a lot of the gains\nthe improvements in\nendurance, strength and size\nthat people are specifically\nusing exercise for.\nSo be cautious about your use\nof non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs\nespecially within the four hours preceding\nor the four hours following exercise.\nSo I hope you're starting\nto get the picture.\nIn order to change the\nnerve to muscle connectivity\nin ways that will better serve you,\nyou need a stressor\nduring the actual training\nwhich particular stressor\ndepends on your training goals.\nBut that stressor is almost always going\nto be associated with inflammation,\nand then after the\ntraining, you want to try\nand get into a state of\nreduced inflammation.\nAnd that's why you would\ndo some sort of protocol\nnon sleep depressed which we\nwill link to in our caption\nor perhaps you would use the hypnosis app\nthat we've talked about before\nReveri, R-E-V-E-R-I.com.\nThere's a great app for\naccessing deep rest states\nor the physiological side\nto try and get your system\nto calm down after training.\nThere are also tools that one\ncan use to reduce inflammation\nat a kind of foundational\nlevel away from training.\nAnd these are tools that I've talked\nabout many times before, but\nI'll just restate them again.\nThe kind of Golden Three\naccording to Andy Galpin\nand the ones that he recommends are\nsufficient omega-3s again,\nthat can be accomplished\nthrough diet, through whole food intake\nor through supplementation or both.\nSo in general, getting\nabove a 1,000 milligrams\nof EPA per day to keep\ninflammation low or relatively low.\nVitamin D and in some\ncases, magnesium malate.\nMagnesium malate seems to\nbe particularly effective\nin offsetting delayed\nonset muscle soreness.\nSoreness itself is not required\nfor improvements in strength,\nimprovements in explosiveness,\nimprovements in hypertrophy.\nThat's a myth.\nNow, if you do experience\ndelayed onset muscle soreness,\nchances are you stressed that\nparticular muscle pretty well\nor even maybe to well, maybe\nyou stressed it too much\nand you need longer recovery.\nThere's a total debate\nout there about whether\nor not you should train again\nwhen a muscle is still sore.\nI think the general takeaway is, no\nthat means it's not recovered.\nAnd there are things\nof course like massage,\nlike fascial release\nand things of that sort\nsauna, cold that can perhaps\naccelerate the movement\nfrom soreness to not sore.\nBut in general, the omega-3, vitamin D,\nand magnesium malate trio\nseemed to be an effective way\nto reduce inflammation at\nkind of a systemic level.\nBut remember you want\ninflammation provided\nyou're not damaging the muscles so much\nthat you're injured during\nthe training session\nbecause that's the stimulus\nfor change in those muscles.\nI want to talk about a few other things\nthat support the process of\nnerve to muscle communication\nand touch on some of the things that a lot\nof people are doing to try\nto \"enhance their workouts\"\nand evaluate whether or not those are\nin fact enhancing workouts or not.\nBecause weight training,\nunlike a lot of other forms\nof exercise has a unique aspect to it,\nwhich is this feature\nthat I guess some people\ncall it the pump which is\nthe fact that blood goes\ninto the muscle when you\ntrain, it's the only gun\nof training where you\nactually get a window\ninto what the result\nmight actually look like\nbefore you actually\naccomplish that result.\nSo if you think about when\nyou go out for a hard run\nand let's say you go\nout for a two mile run,\nlet's say your goal is to break\nyou want to do a sub ten two mile.\nActually, when I went to university\nI was running cross country,\nmy senior year of high school\nand I wanted to walk on\nfor the cross country team.\nAnd so I went out there and turned out\nyou had to do a sub 10, two mile.\nAnd I think the best mile\nI ever ran in high school\nwas a 457, which isn't terrible.\nI can't do that now.\nIt's not even close to what\nthe best high school athletes can do now.\nBut that would have meant\ndoing it back-to-back.\nSo it was sub 10 minute two\nmile didn't even come close.\nI told Costello this story the other day\nand he just kind of laughed at me.\nHe was like, why would you\neven want to run two miles?\nBecause Costello is\nbuilt almost exclusively\nof these type two fast twitch muscles\nthey're designed for moving objects.\nHe's incredibly strong.\nHe has been since he was a puppy.\nI mean that dog could\nprobably drag a tractor\nif he wanted to, but\nhe can't really go far.\nWhereas a Greyhound or a Whippet\nor some of these other\nsight hounds or scent hounds\ncan go, go, go.\nThey have a higher percentage of the\nso-called slow-twitch muscle fibers.\nThey are much better at endurance.\nSo a sub-10 two mile would have\nbeen very, very challenging,\nno chance I could have done that.\nI don't think even with a lot of training.\nBut let's say that you want\nto improve your performance\nin a given type of exercise.\nLet's talk about some of\nthe things that seem to work\nacross the board to improve\nstrength, improve hypertrophy,\nand improve nerve to muscle\ncommunication and performance.\nThe first thing that's absolutely key\nfor nerve to muscle communication\nand physical performance\nof any kind might not\nsound that exciting to you\nbut it is very exciting.\nAnd that's salt.\nNerves cells, neurons\ncommunicate with each other\nand communicate with\nmuscle by electricity.\nBut that electricity is generated\nby particular ions moving\ninto and out of the neuron.\nAnd the rushing in of a\nparticular ion, sodium, salt\nis what allows nerve cells to fire.\nIf you don't have enough\nsalt in your system\nyour neurons and your brain and your nerve\nto muscle communication will be terrible.\nIf you have sufficient\nsalt, it will be excellent.\nHow much salt will depend on\nhow much water you're drinking,\nhow much caffeine you're drinking,\nand how much food you're ingesting.\nAnd whether or not you're\ntaking any diuretics\nhow hot it is, et cetera,\nhow much you're sweating.\nSo you want to make sure\nthat you have enough salt,\npotassium and magnesium in your system\nif you want to perform well.\nI realized that salt isn't\nvery glamorous performance tool\nbut it is a vital.\nIts absolutely vital.\nAnd the endurance athletes\nand the people that train\nin high heat can speak to the fact that\nwhen your electrolytes are low,\nyour brain doesn't function,\nyour body doesn't function nearly as well.\nIn fact, even for mental\nwork, for studying\nand for writing and for\ndoing math and coding,\ndoing analytic work of any kind,\neven a hard conversation\nthat's important to you,\nhaving sufficient electrolytes\nis really going to help\nand being low on electrolytes won't help\nand just drinking water won't help\nbecause you need electrolytes.\nThe other thing that's been\nshown over and over again,\na numerous well-controlled studies\nto improve muscle performance is creatine.\nEarly on there was a lot of\ncontroversy about creatine\nbut there are many studies\nif you want, you can go\nto this website that\neveryone now knows I love\nwhich is this free website examined.com\nthat there are no fewer\nthan 18 studies there.\n66 studies...\nSo 18 studies supporting\nthat muscle creating content\ncan be increased by ingesting creatine.\nHow much creatine?\nWell, I asked the experts and they tell me\nthat for somebody who is about 180 pounds,\nfive grams a day should\nbe sufficient or so.\nHeavier than 180, so if you got like\nif you're a 220 pound or 230 pound person,\n10 to 15 grams of creatine.\nPeople lighter than 180 pounds\nmaybe three to five grams of creatine\nor even one to three grams.\nCreatine is a fuel source for\nearly in bouts of activity\nfor high intensity activity.\nIt is also a fuel source\nfor neurons in the brain\nand it can have some\ncognitive enhancing effects.\nSo creatine is a very\ninteresting molecule.\nEarly on when it was\nreleased as a supplement,\nit was thought that you had to load it\nin higher dosages for a few days\nand then maintain it at lower dosages.\nSo you'd take 20 or 30 grams a day\nthen back off to five or 10.\nIt doesn't seem to be the case\nthat you can get all the benefits\nfrom taking the dosages at the low level.\nI just mentioned a few moments ago\nas they relate to body weight throughout.\nSo salt and electrolytes absolutely key.\nYou need those present.\nYou need to be well hydrated.\nCreatine seems to have a\nperformance enhancing effect.\nThere are 66 studies, 66\nshowing that power output\nis greatly increased\nanywhere from 1%2 to 20%.\nAnd this is sprinting and running\nand jumping as well as\nweightlifting by creatine.\nThe ability to hydrate\nyour body is improved\nby creating because of the\nway that it brings more water\ninto cells of various kinds.\nAs an indirect effect, it\ncan help in increasingly mass\nbecause of the way that it\nbrings more water into muscle\nand probably also because of the way that\nif you get stronger, you\ncan generate more force\nand generate more hypertrophy.\nIt reduces fatigue.\nSeven studies have shown\nthat it reduces fatigue.\nThere are even some interesting effects\non improving cognition after\ntraumatic brain injury.\nAlthough that's a serious\nmedical condition in situations\nyou absolutely should talk to\na board certified physician\nbefore adding anything\nor taking anything out\nof your current regimen.\nThere are a few other\neffects that are interesting\nand notable, but the big ones\nare the ones that I referred\nto before about increased\npower output, et cetera.\nAnd I just want to emphasize\nthat creatine can increase this hormone\nthat we talked about in\nthe testosterone episode,\ndihydrotestosterone which\nis testosterone converted\nby five alpha reductase\ninto dihydrotestosterone.\nIt's the more dominant androgen in humans.\nLeads to increases in strength\nand libido and so forth.\nIt also can increase\nmale pattern baldness.\nSome people, not everybody\nexperience some hair loss\nwith creatine other people don't.\nSome people experience\naccelerated beard growth\nbecause basically [mumbles]\nhas the opposite effect on\nhair follicles on the face\nas it does on the scalp,\nsome people don't.\nWomen who ingest creatine\nthere are essentially no data showing\nthat it increases hair\nloss or facial hair growth,\nbut of course, everyone is different.\nSo you can go to examine.com.\nYou can explore those studies.\nSo creatine definitely a powerful\nperformance enhancing molecule.\nThe other one, one that\npersonally I've never tried\nbut that seems to have a very strong\nand well-supported\neffects is beta-alanine.\nNow, beta-alanine is interesting\nbecause when you hear\nabout weight training\nyou think about heavy\ndeadlifts and bench presses\nall that kind of stuff\nthat people are doing.\nBut beta-alanine seems to support exercise\nthat is of slightly longer duration.\nSo a mix of anaerobic and\naerobic type movement.\nThese are physical performance\nin the 60 to 242nd range.\nSo you can use your mind\nand kind of figure out.\nThings that weights that limit you\nto 8 to 15 repetitions.\nCardiovascular exercise of the sort\nlike rowing or sprinting.\nSo interval work, it seems to\nhelp with that kind of work.\nSo we're not talking about long runs,\nwe're not talking about heavy deadlifts.\nThe standard dose is somewhere\nbetween two and five grams,\nagain, as always check with a doctor,\nmake sure these things are safe for you.\nI'm not responsible for your health.\nYou are.\nI don't say that just to protect me.\nI'd say that also to protect you\nbut it really seems to\nimprove muscular endurance,\nimprove anaerobic running\ncapacity, reduce fatigue.\nThere are even some interesting effects\non reduction of body fat and\nimprovements in lean mass.\nSo creatine, beta-alanine, electrolytes,\nthese are kind of the core three things\nthat seem to improve performance\nand are well supported by\nthe scientific literature.\nAnd in the earlier episode\non supercharging performance\nwe talked about palmer cooling.\nThat's certainly a\nperformance enhancing tool.\nIt's nothing you ingest\nyour cooling your palms\nin a very specific way.\nThat's very powerful.\nNow, what about for longer\nduration bouts of exercise?\nWe've mainly been focusing\non resistance training,\nbut what about for long runs, long swims,\nthese kinds of things?\nWell, it does seem that\njuice and ingesting things\nlike arginine and citrulline\ncan improve performance\nfor those long bouts of exercise\nthat's mainly going to be due to effects\nof those compounds on vasodilation.\nIt's going to open up the vasculature\nand allow more blood flow.\nDo note that things like\ncitrulline and arginine\ncan have some side effects if you will.\nThey can increase the likelihood\nof having herpes cold sore\noutbreaks on the mouth.\nThe arginine is in the\npathway by which I don't know\nif people know this, but\nthe herpes virus lives\non neurons of the trigeminal\nnerve that innervates the lips\nand the eyes and the mucus\nmembranes of the face.\nSo this is the herpes\ntype 1 simplex virus.\nThe virus lives on those neurons\nand then periodically\ninflames those neurons,\nand that's what leads to the\ncold sores seems like arginine\nand citrulline can lead\nto increases in cold sores\nand canker sores, and\noutbreaks of those kinds.\nSo you want to be aware of that.\nThat's not everybody, and not\neverybody is caring HSV-1,\njust be aware that I think\nit's now 80% or 90% of people\nby time they're 12 years old,\nthey've contracted HSV-1.\nIt's very contagious and\ntypically one outbreak,\nand then only under conditions of stress\nor heightened arginine\nor citrulline ingestion\nwe'll have them later.\nAgain, this is not necessarily an STI,\na sexually transmitted infection.\nThis is an infection that\nis passed very easily\nfrom mucous membranes, just\nin terms of touching objects\nand things of that sort.\nVery common in the general population.\nAny discussion about muscle\nand muscle performance\nwould not be adequate if\nwe didn't mention something\nabout nutrition,\nbut rather than have a whole\ndiscussion about nutrition,\n'cause there's lots of\ninformation about that online,\nfor instance, if you want to gain muscle\nthat you need to have a calorie\nsurplus of about 10 to 15%.\nYou could have a calorie surplus of more.\nIf you want to avoid gaining weight\nthen you would not create a\ncalorie surplus, et cetera.\nYou can find all that information online.\nThat's not what this\npodcast is really about.\nWe had a month where we talked a lot\nabout hormones and food and moods.\nWe talked about foods, but more\nas they relate to the nervous system.\nWhen it comes to supporting muscle.\nSo supporting the synthesis of larger\nwhat I called myosin\nballoons, it does seem\nthat ingesting 700 to 3000 milligrams\nof the essential amino acid leucine\nwith each meal is important.\nNow, that does not necessarily\nmean from supplements.\nIn fact, most people recommend\nthat you get your protein,\nyou get your amino acids,\nincluding your essential amino acids\nand your leucine from whole foods.\nHigh quality proteins aren't\nhigh density proteins.\nWhat do you mean by that?\nWell, it is true that a lot of\nsources of protein are found\nin things like beans and\nnuts and things like that\nthat all the essential amino\nacids can be found there\nbut per unit calorie, if\nit's in your practice,\nif it's in your ethics to\ningest animal proteins,\nit's true that for instance, 200 calories\nof steak or chicken or fish or eggs\nwill have a higher density\nof essential amino acids\nthan the equivalent amount of\ncalories from nuts or plants.\nThat's just simply the way it works.\nSo for the vegans and vegetarians\nI'm certainly, I'm not\nsaying there's no way\nthat you can support muscle growth.\nYou absolutely can.\nSome of them might want\nto supplement leucine\nbut this 700 to 3000\nmilligrams of leucine per meal\nis one of the best ways that's been shown\nto support the synthesis of more myosin\nif your goal is hypertrophy\nand it's also the way that you\nwould support muscle repair\nif your goal is strength.\nSo that's specifically geared\ntowards muscle hypertrophy and strength.\nAnd I encourage you to think\nabout this protein density issue.\nAnd whether or not you ingest\nanimal proteins or you don't,\nto think about whether or\nnot you're getting sufficient\nessential amino acids, especially leucine.\nNow, many people have\naddressed the question\nof whether or not you need to\neat six or seven times a day.\nIt turns out that you don't\nthat's kind of the old school thinking\nthat you need to eat very frequently.\nI think for certain\nathletes were very active\nfor drug assisted meaning people\nthat are enhancing their\ntestosterone levels\nto super physiological levels,\nwhere they are experiencing\nvery heightened levels\nof protein synthesis and\nthey can utilize all that.\nThat might make sense.\nAgain, I'm not supporting the use\nof those performance enhancing drugs\nbut there are people doing that.\nAnd that's one of the reasons\nwhy they eat so frequently.\nAnd so much protein for typical people\nwho are not doing that, I\nimagine most of you are not.\nThen it does appear that you need to eat\nbut you don't need to eat\nsix or seven times a day.\nIt does seem like not eating\nonce a day is also important.\nSo somewhere between one meal\na day and six meals a day,\nlies the more reasonable two or three\nor maybe four times a day.\nI think that a whole discussion\nabout this is warranted\nand we'll have this\ndiscussion with Dr. Galpin\nat a future time of whether or not\neating protein more frequently\ncan enhance this myosin synthesis.\nBut I think the simple takeaway\nfrom the literature that\nI was able to extract\nand from my discussion with him is,\neating two to four times a day,\nmaking sure you're getting\nsufficient amino acids\nin a way that's compatible\nwith your ethics\nand with your nutritional regimen\nis going to support muscle\nrepair, muscle growth\nstrength improvements,\net cetera, just fine.\nThere's one more thing\nthat I'd like to cover\nwhich is the relationship\nbetween particular kinds of exercise\nand our ability to think and\nperform cognitive functions.\nWe all hear that exercise\nis so vital for our brain\nthat it supports our brain\nhealth and our body health.\nAnd indeed that's true\nprovided it's done correctly.\nHowever, many of us are\nfamiliar with the experience\nof going for a run or going for a swim\nor working out hard in\nthe gym, and then not\nbeing able to use our brain\nto be essentially useless\nfor cognitive functions\nfor the rest of the day.\nI discussed this with\nDr. Galpin this morning,\nand I learned something very interesting,\nwhich is that hard bouts of exercise\nof the sort where you're\ntraining near failure\nor you're generating focused\nmuscular contractions,\nfor obsession that lasts anywhere\nfrom, I don't know, 30, 45\nminutes, maybe 60 minutes\nor a long run where you're engaging\nin some interval training during that run,\nafter exercise, there's a\nreduction in oxygenation\nof the brain.\nSo there's actually a quite\nsignificant dip in the amount\nof oxygen that your neurons are getting\nand therefore your ability to think.\nSo it's important that\nyou control the intensity\nand the duration of your\ntraining sessions so\nthat you're still able to do well in life\nand lean to life the way you need to,\nbecause I'm guessing most of you are not\nin a position to just prioritize\nyour physical training\nyou also need to use your minds.\nI'm certainly familiar with\nwanting to get exercise\nbut also the requirement of needing\nto perform cognitive\nwork throughout the day.\nIt also turns out that you can leverage\nsomething interesting\nabout exercise and nerve\nto muscle work in ways that can benefit\ncognitive function and focus.\nAnd it has to do with\nthe way that your body\nand your nervous system predict bouts\nof intense focused effort.\nSo let's say you're doing\nresistance training two\nor three times a week,\nmaybe even four times a week\nand you're doing it\nconsistently at a given time.\nThere are clocks,\nliterally biological clocks\nwithin the liver and within the brain\nthat learn to predict that\nfocus and that intense work.\nIf you are trying to get\nintense cognitive work done,\nyou might try scheduling\nthat cognitive work\non the days when you\ndon't do physical training\nat the same time when\nyou normally would do\nthat intense, focused physical training.\nBecause the systems of the body\nthat generate acetylcholine release\nand other neuromodulators, the systems,\nof the body and brain that\ngenerate focused effort,\nthose are on this sort of clock mechanism\nin a way that you likely will find\nthat after just a week of\ntraining at regular times\nyou will be able to focus\nreadily on other things\nwhen you're not training\nprovided you do it\nduring the period of time of day\nwhen you normally would train.\nSo is kind of an indirect positive effect.\nYou're harnessing the focus\nand the expectation of focus\nin your nervous system for\nthat particular time of day.\nAnd of course, we'd be remiss\nif we didn't talk about\ntime of day for training.\nIt turns out that whether or\nnot you train in the morning\nor in the afternoon, it\ndoesn't really seem to matter\nfor sake of things like hypertrophy\nand strength, et cetera.\nEveryone seems to have a time of day\nthat they prefer to train.\nI've said before and their reasons\nbased on body temperature rhythms\nand cortisol release\nthat training 30 minutes,\nthree hours or 11 hours\nafter your normal waking time\ncan be very beneficial and can provide\na sort of predictability or regularity\nto when your body will be ready to train\nand best apt to train well.\nThere is some evidence that training\nin the afternoon is\nbetter for performance,\nwhereas training for\nbody composition changes\nand strain changes, et cetera\ndoesn't really matter when you train.\nSo you also want to make\nit compatible with sleep,\ncompatible with work that really gets\ndown into the wits of optimization.\nBut I think it's interesting to note\nthat if you're going to\ntrain at a regular time,\nyou can take the days when you don't train\nand use that to enhance\nyour cognitive focus\nfor things that have\nnothing to do with exercise.\nSo this might be writing, or reading,\nor music, or math, et cetera.\nTypically, I restrict\nthese podcast episodes\nto about 90 minutes.\nSo called ultradian cycle for learning.\nToday was a bit longer.\nAnd I admit that I tried\nto pack a lot into this.\nIt is the last episode in this month\non physical performance.\nI figured in this case more is better\nespecially since everything\nis time-stamped for you.\nYou certainly don't have\nto watch it all at once\nand you can come back to\nit over and over again\ninto the precise locations\nin the episode that you like\nin order to take notes or\nextract the information\nthat you need.\nI'd like to point you\nto Dr. Andy Galpin page.\nI highly recommend looking into the work\nthat he's doing if you want more details.\nHe's very, very skilled,\nexcellent communicator.\nHe superb at what he does.\nHe's a professor.\nHe works with athletes.\nHe works with typical\nfolks in the exercise\nand muscle physiology world.\nBrad Schoenfelds work.\nI also have a lot of respect for.\nI've never met him.\nI don't know him.\nThere's no paid endorsement here.\nThey're not sponsors are related\nto the podcast in any way.\nI just think the work\nis of very high quality\nand they're both on the academic side\nand the practical side.\nAnd of course there are\nother people out there\ndoing fabulous work in this area as well.\nIf you like this podcast\nand you're benefiting\nfrom the information that you're learning\nand you

like way back\nare still every bit as relevant today\nas they were back in January for somebody\nthat has challenges with sleep\nand wants to understand\nsleep and get better at sleep\nor wants to
