    "transcript": "- Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast\nwhere we discuss science\nand science-based tools for everyday life\nI'm Andrew Huberman.\nAnd I'm a Professor of\nNeurobiology and Ophthalmology\nat Stanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer\ninformation about science\nand science-related tools\nto the general public.\nIn keeping with that theme,\nI'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker analyzes your blood and DNA\nto give you an accurate assessment\nof your health and your biological age.\nThere are many things about our health\nthat can only be analyzed\nfrom blood and DNA tests.\nI've been getting my blood\nassessed for many years now.\nAnd about a year ago, I\nswitched to InsideTracker.\nWhat I like about InsideTracker\nis that you get all this information back\nabout metabolic factors,\nendocrine factors, et cetera,\nthat are really important to your health.\nBut unlike a lot of blood tests\nwhere you just get all the\nnumbers back and it tells you\nwhether or not things\nare high, normal, or low,\nInsideTracker also has this really useful\nand really easy-to-use dashboard\nthat takes the information\nfor your blood and DNA tests\nand points you toward particular\nbehavioral, nutritional,\nand other sorts of\nprotocols that you can use\nto get the numbers where you\nwant them for your health.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker,\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nand they will give you 25%\noff any of their programs.\nAgain, their programs allow\nyou to assess your health\nfrom the inside,\nthings that you could just never assess\nfrom any kind of test that\ndidn't involve blood and DNA.\nAnd it also has this\nreally interesting feature\nthat it can measure your inner age,\nwhich is based on biology.\nYour chronological age, of\ncourse, is very informative\nabout your health and\nwhere you ought to be\nin terms of health\nmetrics, but people vary.\nWe know people, of course,\nthat are in their late\n90s who are doing well.\nWe know people that are in\ntheir 50s who are struggling\nor even in their 20s.\nSo, blood and DNA are the\nway to analyze your health.\nThat's my belief.\nThat's why I use InsideTracker.\nSo, go to insidetracker.com/huberman\nto get 25% off any of their products\nand use \"Huberman\" at checkout.\nOur second sponsor of today's\nepisode is Helix Sleep.\nHelix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows\nthat are ideally suited to your needs\nfor the best night's sleep possible.\nI switched to using a Helix\nmattress and Helix pillow\nthis last year\nand I'm sleeping better\nthan I ever have before.\nThe way that Helix mattresses work\nand the reason they're different,\nis that they are tailored to\nyour individual sleep style.\nYour sleep style can be assessed\nby going to their website,\nyou take a brief two-minute\nquestionnaire quiz.\nAsks you questions like,\ndo you sleep on your back\nor your side or your stomach?\nMaybe you don't know\nor maybe you move around\na lot during the night.\nIt also asks you questions\nsuch as do you tend to run hot\nor wake up cold, things of that sort.\nAnd then they tailor a particular mattress\nto your sleep needs.\nFor me, I matched to the\nso-called Dusk, D-U-S-K mattress.\nAnd I love it.\nI sleep better than ever.\nAnd right now, if you\nwant to try Helix Sleep\nyou can go to helixsleep.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that, you'll\nget $200 off your order\nplus two free pillows.\nThey also have a great warranty.\nThey have a 10-year warranty\non their mattresses.\nIf you don't like the\nmattress for any reason,\nthey'll pick it up for\nfree from your home.\nAnd they just make the whole\nthing really easy to try\nand determine whether or\nnot it's right for you.\nSo again, it's helixsleep.com/huberman\nto get $200 off\nand two free pillows on your first order.\nSome of you have asked how you\ncan help support the podcast\nin yet other ways, besides\njust checking out our sponsors.\nWe really appreciate the question\nand we've set up a Patreon account\nat patreon.com/AndrewHuberman\nwhich allows you to donate to the podcast\nat a variety of different levels.\nWe have, for instance, the 5-HTP,\nwhich is in honor of a serotonin.\n5-HTP is the name for serotonin\nthat it allows you to donate $5 per month.\nWe have the circadian,\nwhich as many of you, of course,\nwill know is 24-hour day.\nSo, you can donate $24\na month if you like.\nYou can also pick any value that you want.\nWe even have the Costello,\nwhich is $10 a month\nwhich allows you to support the podcast\nin honor of Costello.\nThe fact that he's 10 years old,\nthat he eats 10 pounds of food a day,\nand the fact that he takes\n10 one-hour naps per day\non average.\nSo again, that's\npatreon.com/AndrewHuberman\nif you'd like to support\nthe podcast that way.\nToday's episode is going to be all about\nthe science of emotions.\nThe first month of the podcast,\nwe talked about sleep and wakefulness.\nLast month, we were talking\nabout neuroplasticity,\nthe brain's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nAnd this month we're going to talk\nabout these things that we call emotions.\nWe're going to decipher what\nthey are, how they work,\nhow we can control them\nwhen we might not want to control them.\nThere are going to be\nfour episodes on emotions.\nAnd today, we're going\nto talk in particular\nabout something that most\noften is called stress.\nNow, you might be thinking,\n\"Wait, stress isn't an emotion.\"\nBut stress really lies at\nthe heart of whether or not\nour internal experience\nis matched well or not\nto our external experience\nwhere the events\nthat are happening to us and around us.\nAnd as you'll soon, see\nthose converge or combine\nto create what we call emotions.\nNow, I want to be very clear\nthat we're going to talk\nabout the biology of emotions,\nwe're going to talk a little bit\nabout some psychological\nconcepts related to emotion,\nand we are definitely going to talk\nabout tools to control what we call stress\nor commonly think of as stress.\nWe're also going to clean up\nsome common myths about stress.\nFor instance, that stress\nimpairs your immune system.\nThat's true in certain contexts.\nAnd in other contexts,\nstress actually enhances\nyour immune system\nand makes it function better.\nThere is going to be a lot of discussion\nabout whether or not our internal state,\nwhether or not we are alert\nor calm is good or bad,\ndepending on the circumstances.\nSo, where we're headed here\nis I'd like you to come\naway from today's episode\nwith what I call an organizational logic,\na framework for thinking\nabout these things\nthat typically we just call happy or sad\nor depressed or anxious.\nAnd I'm going to make\nsure that you have tools\nthat are grounded in\nphysiology and neuroscience\nthat will allow you to navigate\nthis otherwise complex space\nthat we call emotions\nthat will allow you to\nground yourself better\nwhen you're feeling like\nlife is weighing on you,\nwhere you're kind of being\npulled by the currents of life\nas well as to support other people\nwhether or not that's in\na psychological practice\nif you're a practitioner, or\nyou have clients or children\nor spouses, really, to be\nable to support other people\nin your environment better.\nAnd the tools that I'm\ngoing to focus on today\nrange from behavioral tools.\nWe will talk about some\nof the more valuable\nsupplementation tools that are out there.\nAnd we're going to talk a little bit\nabout things like depression, PTSD,\nbut we will be devoting entire episodes\nto things like depression,\nPTSD, and even attention deficit\nand obsessive compulsive disorder,\nwhich believe it or not,\nalthough this might not\nsurprise many of you,\nhave a very strong emotional component.\nIt's just not just about\ncompulsive behaviors\nand intrusive thoughts.\nIt's also about the emotional\nload of being in that state.\nSo, I promise that today\nwe're going to clean up\na lot of misunderstanding.\nWe're going to give you a lot of tools\nand you're going to learn a lot\nabout the biology of how your\nbody and brain work together.\nBecause if ever there was a topic\nthat brought together the brain and body\nor mind-body relationship,\nit's stress and emotions.\nIt's also the positive emotions.\nWhen we feel something,\nwhether or not we're super happy\nor just feeling kind of pleasant\nor we are feeling stressed,\nanxious, and overwhelmed,\nit isn't just in our head.\nIt's also in our body.\nAnd as you may recall, the nervous system,\nwhich includes the brain and\nthe eyes and the spinal cord,\nbut also all the connections\nwith the organs of the body\nincludes the brain and body.\nAnd those organs of the body,\nyour gut, and your liver, and your spleen,\nthey're also communicating with the brain.\nSo, I look forward to a day, in fact,\nwhen we no longer think about neuroscience\nas just the brain.\nAnd many neuroscientists now\nalso think about the body, of course.\nAnd the brain controls the body,\nbut the body is also\nhaving a very profound\nand concrete influence on the brain.\nI think up until recently,\npeople would hear\nabout kind of brain-body and\nalways think about mindfulness.\nWe're actually not going to talk\nthat much about mindfulness at all today.\nMindfulness is kind of a\nvague concept, in fact.\nWhen you think about mindfulness,\nit's good to take the opposite.\nWhat's the opposite of mindfulness?\nWould be mindlessness.\nWell, all of a sudden we're into territory\nthat isn't really easy for one person\nto describe their experience\nor to help others with their experience.\nToday, we're going to\ntalk about objective tools\nthat match the brain-body experience\nor separate the brain-body experience\nin ways that leverage your\nability to lean into life better,\nto feel better, literally\nto just feel better\nabout what you're experiencing,\nand believe it or not, to be\nable to control your emotions\nwhen that's appropriate.\nThis isn't about becoming robotic.\nThis isn't about trying not to feel human.\nThis is actually about being\nable to lean into life better\nas a consequence of being able to control\nsome of your inner real estate.\nThis nervous system that\nincludes the brain and body\nand how that nervous system is interacting\nwith the outside world.\nSo, it's to place you in a\ngreater position of power.\nAnd so, let's get started in\ndeciphering what is stress,\nwhat are emotions, and why did\nI batch stress and emotions\ninto one discussion today?\nOkay.\nSo, what is stress?\nWe hear all the time that stress is bad.\nWe hear people saying\nthey're really stressed out.\nWhat is stress?\nYou've all presumably heard\nthe arguments or the framework\nthat stress is this horrible\nancient carryover over\nfrom times in which humans\nwere pursued by animals\nor other human predators\nand that whenever we\nfeel what we call stress\nor feel stressed out,\nthat it's just this unfortunate\ninvasion of something\nthat we no longer need in modern life,\nthat this was designed for\nwhen we were being attacked\nby bears or tigers or\nlions or whatever it is.\nAnd gosh, what an unfortunate thing.\nAnd we have so many\ncreature comforts nowadays,\nbut we have not eliminated this stress.\nAlmost as if it was like an\norgan or a system in our body\nthat was bad for us, that we're stuck with\njust because of the species that we are.\nBut first of all, all\nspecies experience stress.\nAnd I think that it's fair to say\neven though I wasn't there,\nthat yes, in fact, throughout\nour evolutionary history,\nwe were vulnerable to animal attack\nand other human attacks on a regular basis\nup until a point where we\nstarted developing weapons\nand structures and fire and other things\nthat allow us to protect ourselves better\nfrom those animals and\ninvaders of various kinds.\nBut it is entirely naive for us to think\nthat in ancient times,\nancient times being kind of loose term\nfor previous on medieval times,\n100 years ago, 1000 years\nago, 10,000 years ago,\nof course, there were infidelities, right?\nPartners cheated.\nPeople died.\nIn fact, before the advent of phones,\nwhich we're going to talk about today,\nyou can imagine that someone\nmight head off on a hunt\nor to go visit a relative\nand never come back\nand you would never know why.\nThat would be very stressful.\nSo, there was psychosocial stress.\nThere was the stress of losing loved ones.\nThere was the stress of cold, of famine.\nThere was the stress\nprobably also of just worry.\nThis idea that ancient versions of humans\n1000 years ago, 100\nyears ago didn't worry,\nI think that is entirely inconsistent\nwith everything we know\nabout the structure\nof the human brain 100\nyears, 1000 years ago.\nSo, all the problems that\nwe're struggling with\nexisted forever.\nIt's just that stress at its\ncore is a generalized system.\nIt wasn't designed for tigers attacking us\nor people attacking us.\nIt's a system to mobilize\nother systems in the brain\nand body.\nThat's what stress really is.\nIt's designed to be generic.\nAnd that's the most important thing\nthat I'd like you to understand today,\nis that the system that\ngoverns what we call stress\nis generic.\nIt wasn't designed for one thing.\nAnd that gives it a certain advantage\nin taking over the state\nof our brain and body,\nbut it also gives you, all of us\nan advantage in controlling it\nbecause it's based on\nhard-wired biological mechanisms\nand there are hard-wired\nbiological mechanisms,\nmeaning cells and chemicals\nand pathways and tissues\nthat exist in you right now\nthat require no neuroplasticity\nthat allow you to put a brake on stress.\nAnd so, we're going to talk about those.\nSo, you have a system for stress\nand you have a system for\ndistress that are baked into you.\nThey were genetically encoded.\nAnd you were born with them\nand you still have them now.\nSo, if you're alive and listening,\nyou have the capacity\nto control your stress.\nAnd today, I'm going to talk about ways\nthat you can control your stress,\nnot just by doing some\noffline practice of meditation\nor breath work or something like that,\nbut real-time tools.\nTools that allow you\nto push back on stress\nwhen stress hits in real time.\nThis is something that\nmy lab works actively on\nin developing and testing these tools\nand evolving these tools.\nAnd there are other laboratories\nthat do this as well.\nSo, let's talk about the stress response.\nAnd by doing that, you\nwill understand exactly why\nthe tools I'm going to give you work.\nFor those of you that are saying,\n\"Wait, I just want the tools.\nJust give me a summary,\"\ntrust me, if you understand mechanism,\nyou are going to be in\na far better position\nto incorporate these tools, to\nteach these tools to others,\nand to modify them as your\nlife circumstances change.\nIf you'd like the cheat sheet\nor you just want the one-page PDF,\neventually we'll get\nthat stuff out to people,\nbut it's really important to understand\nthe underlying mechanism.\nOkay.\nSo, what is stress?\nWell, let's just distinguish\nbetween stressors,\nwhich are the things that stress us out,\nand stress, which is the psychological\nand physiological response to stressors.\nI'm mainly going to talk about stress,\nwhich is your response to things.\nLet's be clear about what we already know,\nwhich is that stressors\ncan be psychological\nor they can be physical.\nOkay?\nIf I put you outside on a\ncold day without a jacket\nfor a very long time,\nthat is stressful.\nIf I have you prepare for\ntoo many exams at once\nand you can't balance it\nall with your sleep schedule\nand your other needs for\ncomfort and wellbeing,\nlike food, rest, sleep,\nand social connection,\nthat is stressful.\nSo, stress, and as I\nmentioned before, is generic.\nIt doesn't distinguish\nbetween physical and emotional stress.\nSo, what happens when\nthe stress response hits?\nLet's talk about the immediate\nor what we call the acute stress response.\nWe could also think of\nthis as short-term stress.\nSo, you have a collection of neurons.\nThey have a name.\nIt's called the sympathetic chain ganglia.\nAnd it has nothing to do with sympathy.\nSympa means together.\nAnd there's a group of neurons\nthat start right about at your neck\nand run down to about your\nnavel, a little bit lower,\nand those are called the\nsympathetic chain ganglia.\nYou don't need to memorize that name.\nThere will not be a quiz.\nBut it's important to know that\nin the middle of your body,\nyou have a chain of neurons\nthat when something stresses us out,\neither in our mind\nor because something\nenters our environment\nand we see something that stresses us out,\nthat we don't like heights\nif you're afraid of heights,\nsomebody you dislike walks\ninto the room, et cetera,\nthat chain of neurons becomes activated\nlike a bunch of dominoes\nfalling on all at once.\nIt's very fast.\nWhen that happens,\nthose neurons release a\nneuromodulator neurochemical\nthat I've talked about\nbefore on this podcast\ncalled acetylcholine.\nThey release that at various\nsites within the body.\nNow, this is important because normally,\nacetylcholine would be\nused to move muscles.\nActually, every time we move a muscle,\npick up a cup of coffee, write with a pen,\nwalk down the street,\nit's spinal neurons connecting to muscle\nand releasing acetylcholine.\nSo, in the brain it's involved in focus\nand it muscles is involved\nin making muscles twitch.\nBut if we were stressed,\nwe wouldn't want all our\nmuscles to contract at once\nbecause we would just be kind\nof like paralyzed like this\nin what tonic activation, as it's called.\nWe wouldn't want that.\nSomething called tetanus,\nbelieve it or not.\nbecause the tetanus toxin\nwill cause that kind of rigor\nof the entire body.\nYou do not want that.\nWhen those neurons are activated,\nacetylcholine is released,\nbut there are some other neurons\nfor the aficionados out there.\nThey're called the postganglionic neurons.\nThose ones respond to that acetylcholine\nand then they release epinephrine,\nwhich is the equivalent to adrenaline.\nSo, we have this system\nwhere it's very fast\nwhenever we're stressed,\nthe core of our body,\nthese neurons down the middle of our body\nrelease these chemicals\nand then there's adrenaline or epinephrine\nreleased at particular organs\nand acts in particular ways.\nWe're going down into the weeds here.\nSo just stay with me because\nit's going to make a lot of sense\nand you will appreciate\nhaving this knowledge in hand.\nThat epinephrine acts\nin two different ways.\nSome things like the muscles\nof your legs and your heart\nand other things that need to be active\nwhen you're stressed,\nthey have a certain kind of receptor\nwhich is called the beta receptor.\nAnd that beta receptor\nresponds to epinephrine\nand blood vessels dilate.\nThey get bigger and blood\nrushes in to our legs.\nThe heart rate speeds up.\nLots of things happen that get activated.\nAnd at the same time,\nthat epinephrine activates other receptors\non certain tissues that we don't need.\nThe ones involved in\ndigestion, reproduction,\nand things of that sort that are luxuries\nfor when things are going well,\nnot things to pay attention\nto when we're stressed.\nAnd that binds to other receptors\nthat contract the blood vessels.\nSo, basically the stress response,\nthis is the key phrase here,\nthe stress response A, is\ngeneric, I said that before,\nand B, it basically pushes\ncertain systems to be activated\nand other systems to not be activated.\nSo, the stress response is two-pronged.\nIt's a yes for certain things\nand it's a no, you may not\nright now for other things.\nSo, that's the key thing to understand\nabout the stress response.\nThat's why your heart speeds up.\nThat's why you feel\nblood in certain organs\nand tissues of your\nbody, but not in others.\nThat's why your throat goes dry\nbecause it turns out that\nwhen you get stressed,\nthe salivary glands are shut down.\nThere's a lot less blood flow\nto the neurons that control salivation.\nAnd so, you're going to start swallowing.\nYou feel like your throat is getting dry.\nThere are a lot of different effects.\nI'm not going to list them\nall off, but basically,\nyou are activated in ways\nthat support you moving.\nSo, that's the third thing.\nIt's first of all, it's generic.\nSecond of all, the stress\nresponse, activate certain things\nand shuts down other features of our body.\nAnd then it's a sense of agitation\nthat makes you want to move.\nAnd that's because fundamentally,\nthe stress response is\njust this generic thing\nthat says do something.\nAnd movement in this case\ncan either be the bias\nto move in terms of action,\nor it can be the bias to say something.\nWhen we are stressed, we are\nmore likely to say something\nthat probably we shouldn't say.\nWe are more likely to move.\nAnd if you're trying to suppress movement,\nyou'll feel that as a tremor.\nYou're going to feel agitated\nand that's because it\nwas designed to move you.\nSo, this is important because\nif you want to control stress,\nyou need to learn how to\nwork with that agitation.\nI'd like to give you a tool at this point,\nbecause I think if we go any further\nwith a lot more science,\npeople are going to begin to\nwonder if this is just going to be\na kind of standard university lecture\nabout the stress response.\nI'm going to give you more\nsigns about the stress response,\nbut I want to take what\nwe now already know\nabout the stress response\nand use that as a framework\nfor thinking about\nhow one might reduce or even\neliminate the stress response\nquickly in real time, should\nit arise when we don't want it.\nSo, we're taking the podium\nor we're sitting down at a Zoom call,\nand all of a sudden we're feeling flushed.\nWe're feeling like our heart is racing.\nWe're feeling a little too alert.\nWe're feeling a little worked\nup and we want to calm down.\nAs far as I am aware of,\nthe best tools to reduce stress quickly,\nso-called real-time tools\nare going to be tools\nthat have a direct line\nto the so-called autonomic nervous system.\nThe autonomic nervous\nsystem is a name given\nto the kind of general\nfeatures of alertness\nor calmness in the body.\nTypically, it means automatic.\nAlthough we do have some control over it\nat certain what so-called\nleavers are entry points.\nHere's what doesn't\nwork to control stress.\nTelling yourself to calm down.\nIn fact, that tends to\njust exacerbate stress.\nTelling someone else to calm down\nalso tends to exacerbate their stress.\nIf you want to reduce the\nmagnitude of the stress response,\nthe best thing you can do is activate\nthe other system in the body\nwhich is designed for\ncalming and relaxation.\nAnd that system is called\nthe parasympathetic nervous system.\nBecause as I mentioned before,\nthe neurons that control stress\nrun from about your neck to your navel.\nThe parasympathetic neurons,\npara just means near,\nexist in, they're some\nof the cranial nerves.\nSo, it's kind of left\nneck and lower brainstem.\nKind of back of the brain and in the neck\nand in the pelvic area.\nAnd the parasympathetic nervous\nsystem is really interesting\nbecause especially the cranial nerves,\nthe ones that are up in the\nbrainstem and in the neck area,\nthose have a direct line to\nvarious features of your face,\nin particular, the eyes.\nThey control things like eye\nmovements, pupil dilation,\nthings of that sort,\nas well as the tongue, the\nfacial muscles, et cetera.\nThe parasympathetic nervous system,\nmany people don't realize this,\nis the system by which we\ncontrol the face and the eyes,\nand to some extent, our\nairway, the trachea.\nAnd it's these neurons that\nreside within the pelvic area.\nNow, the neurons within the pelvic area\nare involved in control of\nthe genitals, the bladder,\nand the rectum.\nAnd those don't have a direct line.\nYou don't have a direct\nway to control those.\nIt actually has to go\nfrom brain to spinal cord\nand then out to those organs.\nWhereas the parasympathetic nervous system\nhas certain entry points\nor what I'll call leavers\nthat will allow you to push\nback on the stress response\nin real time and diminish it\nand feel more relaxed really quickly.\nSo, I'm going to teach\nyou the first tool now,\nso I don't overwhelm you with\nall this academic knowledge\nwithout giving you something useful.\nAnd the tool that at least to\nmy knowledge is the fastest\nand most thoroughly grounded\nin physiology and neuroscience\nfor calming down in a self-directed way\nis what's called the\nphysiological sigh, S-I-G-H.\nNow, some of you might've\nheard me talk about this\non previous podcasts,\nbut I'm going to explain\nthis in the context\nof how respiration in general\nis used to calm us down.\nAnd turns out you're all\ndoing this all the time,\nbut you are doing it involuntarily.\nAnd when you stress, you tend to forget\nthat you can also activate\nthese systems voluntarily.\nThis is an extremely\npowerful set of techniques\nthat we know from scientific studies\nthat are being done in my lab,\nJack Feldman's lab at UCLA,\nand others now that are very, very useful\nfor reducing your stress\nresponse in real time.\nAnd here's how they work.\nThese days, there seems\nto be a lot of interest\nin breath work.\nBreath work typically, is\nwhen you go and you sit down\nor you lie down and you\ndeliberately breathe\nin a particular way\nfor a series of minutes\nin order to shift your\nphysiology, access some states.\nAnd it does have some utility\nthat we're going to talk about,\nthat is not what I'm talking about now.\nWhat I'm talking about when I\nrefer to physiological sighs,\nis the very real medical\nschool textbook relationship\nbetween the brain, the body,\nand the body as it relates\nto the breathing apparati,\nmeaning the diaphragm\nand lungs and the heart.\nLet's take the hallmark\nof the stress response.\nThe heart starts beating faster.\nBlood is shuttled to the\nbig muscles of the body\nto move you away from\nwhatever it is the stressor is\nor just make you feel like\nyou need to move or talk.\nYour face goes flushed, et cetera.\nHeart rate, many of us\nfeel is involuntary.\nJust kind of functions whether\nor not we're moving fast\nor moving slow.\nIf you think about it, it's\nnot really purely autonomic\nbecause you can speed up\nyour heart rate by running\nor you can slow it down\nby slowing down your run.\nYou can move to a walk or lie down.\nBut that's indirect control.\nThere is however, a way\nin which you can breathe\nthat directly controls your heart rate\nthrough the interactions\nbetween the sympathetic\nand the parasympathetic nervous system.\nHere's how it works.\nWhen you inhale,\nso whether or not it's through the nose\nor through the mouth,\nthis skeletal muscle\nthat's inside your body\ncalled the diaphragm, it moves down.\nAnd that's because the lungs expand,\nthe diaphragm moves down.\nYour heart actually\ngets a little bit bigger\nin that expanded space.\nThere's more space for the heart.\nSo, not your emotional\nheart getting bigger.\nI'm talking about your\nactual physical heart\ngetting a little bit bigger.\nThe volume grows.\nAnd as a consequence,\nwhatever blood is in there\nis now at a lower volume or\nmoving a little bit more slowly\nin that larger volume than\nit was before you inhaled.\nOkay?\nSo more space, heart gets bigger.\nBlood moves more slowly.\nAnd there's a little group of neurons\ncalled the sinoatrial node\nin the heart that registers,\nbelieve it or not,\nthose neurons pay attention\nto the rate of blood\nflow through the heart\nand send a signal up to the brain\nthat blood is moving more\nslowly through the heart.\nThe brain then sends a\nsignal back to the heart\nto speed the heart up.\nSo, what this means is\nif you want your heart to beat faster,\ninhale longer, inhale more\nvigorously than your exhales.\nNow, there are a variety of\nways that one could do that,\nbut it doesn't matter\nif it's through the nose\nor through the mouth.\nIf your inhales are\nlonger than your exhales,\nyou're speeding up your heart.\nIf your inhales are more vigorous,\nso even if your inhales are\nshorter than your exhales,\nyou are speeding up your heart rate.\nNow, the opposite is also true.\nIf you want to slow your heart rate down,\nso stress response hits,\nyou want to slow your heart rate down,\nwhat you want to do is again,\ncapitalize on this\nrelationship between the body,\nmeaning the diaphragm and\nthe heart and the brain.\nHere's how it works.\nWhen you exhale, the diaphragm moves up,\nwhich makes the heart\na little bit smaller.\nIt actually gets a little more compact.\nBlood flows more quickly\nthrough that compact space\nsort of like just a pipe getting smaller.\nThe sinoatrial node registers\nthat blood is going more quickly,\nsends a signal up to the brain.\nAnd the parasympathetic nervous system,\nsome neurons in your\nbrain stem send a signal\nback to the heart to slow the heart down.\nSo, if you want to calm down quickly,\nyou need to make your exhales longer\nand or more vigorous than your inhales.\nNow, the reason this is so attractive\nas a tool for controlling stress\nis that it works in real time.\nThis doesn't involve a\npractice that you have to go\nand sit there and do\nanything separate from life.\nAnd we are going to get to emotion.\nEmotions and stress happen in real time.\nAnd so, while it's wonderful\nto have a breath work practice\nor to have the opportunity\nto get a massage\nor sit in a sauna or do\nwhatever it is that you do\nin order to set your stress\ncontrols in the right direction,\nhaving tools that you\ncan reach to in real time\nthat require no learning,\nI mean, I had to teach it to\nyou, you had to learn that,\nbut it doesn't require any plasticy\nto activate these pathways.\nSo, if you're feeling stressed,\nyou still need to inhale, of course,\nbut you need to lengthen your exhales.\nNow, there's a tool\nthat capitalizes on this\nin a kind of unique\nway, a kind of a twist,\nwhich is the physiological sigh.\nThe physiological sigh was\ndiscovered in the '30s.\nIt's now been explored at\nthe neuro-biological level\nand mechanistically in far more detail\nby Jack Feldman's lab at UCLA.\nAlso Mark Krasnow's lab at Stanford.\nAnd the physiological sigh\nis something that humans\nand animals do anytime they\nare about to fall asleep.\nYou also do it throughout\nsleep from time to time\nwhen carbon dioxide,\nwhich we'll talk about in a moment,\nbuilds up too much in your system.\nAnd the physiological sigh is something\nthat people naturally start\ndoing when they've been crying\nand they're trying to\nrecover some air or calm down\nwhen they've been sobbing very hard\nor when they are in\nclaustrophobic environments.\nHowever, the amazing\nthing about this thing\nthat we call the diaphragm,\nthe skeletal muscle,\nis that it's an internal organ\nthat you can control voluntarily,\nunlike your spleen or your\nheart or your pancreas\nwhere you can't just say, \"Oh,\nI want to make my pancreas\nturn out a little more insulin right now.\nI'm just going to do that\nwith my mind directly.\"\nYou can't do that.\nYou can do that by smelling\na really good donut\nor something,\nbut you can't just do it directly.\nYou can move your diaphragm\nintentionally, right?\nYou can do it anytime you want.\nAnd it'll run in the background\nif you're not thinking about it.\nSo, this incredible pathway\nthat goes from brain to diaphragm\nthrough what's called the\nphrenic nerve, P-H-R-E-N-I-C.\nPhrenic.\nThe phrenic nerve\ninnervates the diaphragm.\nYou can control anytime you want.\nYou can double up your inhales\nor triple up your inhales.\nYou can exhale more than your inhales.\nWhatever you want to do.\nSuch an incredible organ.\nAnd the physiological sigh is something\nthat we do spontaneously.\nBut when you're feeling stressed,\nyou can do a double\ninhale, [inhales deeply]\n[exhales] long exhale.\nNow, I just told you a minute ago\nthat if you inhale more than you exhale,\nyou're going to speed the heart rate up,\nwhich would promote more\nstress and activation.\nNow I'm telling you to\ndo a double inhale-exhale\nin order to calm down.\nAnd the reason is the double inhale-exhale\nwhich is the physiological sigh\ntakes advantage of the fact\nthat when we do a double inhale,\neven if the second inhale is sneaking in\njust a tiny bit more air,\nbecause it's kind of hard to get\nto deep inhales back to back,\nyou do big deep inhale\nand then another little\nones sneaking it in,\nthe little sacks in your lungs.\nIf you only have the lungs.\nYour lungs are just two big bags,\nbut you've got millions of little sacks\nthroughout the lungs that\nactually make the surface area\nof your lungs as big as a tennis court.\nIt's amazing if we were\nto just spread out.\nThose tend to collapse as we get stressed.\nAnd carbon dioxide builds\nup in our bloodstream\nand that's one of the reasons\nwe feel agitated as well.\nSo, and it makes us very jittery.\nI mean, there's some other\neffects of carbon dioxide\nI don't want to get into,\nbut when you do the double inhale-exhale,\nthe double inhale reinflates\nthose little sacks of the lungs.\nAnd then when you do the long exhale,\nthat long exhale is\nnow much more effective\nat reading your body and\nbloodstream of carbon dioxide,\nwhich relaxes you very quickly.\nMy lab in collaboration\nwith David Spiegel's lab,\nDavid's the Associate Chair\nof Psychiatry at Stanford,\nare doing a study right now\nexploring how physiological sighs\nand other patterns of\nbreathing done deliberately\ncan modulate the stress response\nand other things related to emotionality.\nThose work are ongoing.\nI want to be clear those\nstudies aren't done.\nBut it's very clear from work in our labs,\nfrom work in Jack\nFeldman's lab and others,\nthat the physiological sigh\nis the fastest, hardwired way\nfor us to eliminate this\nstressful response in our body\nquickly in real time.\nAnd so, I'm excited to give you this tool\nbecause I think most people\nhave heard that mindfulness\nand meditation is good,\nexercise is good for us,\nwe all need to be getting\nenough sleep, et cetera,\nbut life happens.\nAnd when you find yourself in a position\nwhere you are more alert and activated\nthan you would like to be,\nregardless of whether or not the stressor\nis relationship-based or it's\nfinancial or it's physical\nor anything like that,\nyou can look to the physiological sigh\nbecause it bypasses a\nvery important feature\nof how we function,\nwhich is that it's very\nhard to control the mind\nwith the mind,\nespecially when we are in\nheightened states of activation.\nWhen you're very alert or very sleepy,\nit is very hard to use these\nso-called top-down mechanisms\nof intention and gratitude\nand all these things\nthat are really powerful\ntools when we are not\nsuper activated and\nstressed or not super tired.\nBut when we are anywhere in the range\nof very alert and stressed to very sleepy,\nphysiological sighs are a powerful way\nof bringing our level of\nso-called autonomic activation,\nwhich just means our\nlevel of alertness down.\nAnd so, whether or not\nit's in line at the bank\nor whether or not you're\nwearing a mask nowadays\nor you're not,\nwhatever the conditions\nmay be where you're at\nand your needs,\nwhen you're feeling stressed,\nthe physiological sigh done\njust one to three times,\nit will be double inhale, exhale,\ndouble inhale, exhale maybe just two times\nwill bring down your level\nof stress very, very fast.\nAnd as far as I know,\nit's the fastest way to accomplish that.\nAn important note about\nthe physiological sigh\nor exhale-emphasized breathing\nfor lowering the stress response.\nMany people worry that their heart rate\ndoes not come down fast enough.\nI want to tell you you do\nnot want your heart rate\nto reduce very fast.\nThere's actually something\ncalled the vasovagal response,\nwhere people will stand up\nor they'll get up in\nthe middle of the night\nto use the bathroom and\nthen all of a sudden,\nthey'll collapse, they'll faint.\nThat's because the heart\nrate was reduced too much.\nSome people will see blood\nor they'll see something\nreally troubling and stressful\nand they'll pass out.\nThat's an over-activation\nor an acceleration of\nthe calming response.\nThey're not so stressed\nthat they kind of fall\noff the cliff of stress.\nThey get so stressed\nthat the rebound mechanism\nfor calming themselves down\ngoes too high, too fast.\nThey calmed down too fast\nand they collapse and faint.\nAnd so, be aware that if you're going\nto use the physiological sigh\nor exhale-emphasized\nbreathing to calm down,\nthat your heart rate will\ntake about 20 to 30 seconds\nto come down to baseline.\nAnd you may need to repeat\nthe physiological sigh\na few times.\nSo, that's an important note\nabout the use of breathing\nto control levels of stress.\nThe other thing is that when\nyou decide to look to the body\nto control the mind,\nit does something else\nthat's very powerful.\nWhen you are stressed\nin your mind and body,\nso you're feeling really\nagitated, activated, and worried,\nand you use a tool like\nthe physiological sigh\nor exhale-emphasized breathing,\nyou will notice that then\nyour brain and your mind\nbecomes more available for\ncontrolling the stress response\nand reacting to it.\nWhich is great because the\nsweet spot in life is to be,\nprovided you're not trying to sleep,\nis to be alert and calm.\nAnd so, that's the idea.\nIs to be alert and calm\nand to bring you back into that\nsort of plane of alertness.\nFor those of you that\nhave trouble sleeping\nor just relaxing through the day,\nthe physiological sigh can be repeated\nfor 10, 15 cycles if you like.\nSome people find that it\nactually puts them to sleep.\nSo, if they lie down and they're reading\nand they do too many of these,\nthat actually can put them to sleep.\nAnd what you'll find is that\nmost breath work protocols,\nthe kind of stuff that's\ndone away from real life,\nthat you set aside time\nand decide to do quote\nunquote, breath work,\nmost of that works such\nthat if you're doing inhales\nthat are longer and more\nvigorous than exhales,\nit tends to be activating and alert you.\nIf you're doing exhales that are longer\nand more vigorous than the inhales,\nit tends to put you to sleep.\nAnd many of the protocols\nthat are out there\nfrom laboratories and\nthat populate the internet\nand wellness sites and whatnot,\nif it's exhale-emphasized breathing,\noftentimes has been used as a tool\nfor trying to teach people to fall asleep.\nPhysiological sigh is a little different.\nIt's designed to be used in real time.\nJust think of it is just\nkind of in your kit of things\nthat you can do as life happens\nand as you need to react to life.\nA note about nasal versus mouth breathing,\nthere's a plethora of\ninformation out there now\nbecause of James Nestor's book,\n\"Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art,\"\nwhich came out this last year.\nExcellent book.\nAs well as \"Jaws\" which is\nfrom Sandra Kahn, Paul Ehrlich\nwith a foreword by Jared\nDiamond and Robert Sapolsky.\nSo, a collection of people from Stanford.\nJared Diamond is not at\nStanford, but the rest are.\nAnd some heavy hitters on that book,\nwhich is about the benefits\nof nasal breathing.\nAnd in many cases, nasal\nbreathing is more advantageous\nthan mouth breathing\nfor all sorts of things.\nCosmetic features of the\nface, especially in kids,\nwarding off infection, et cetera.\nWith the physiological\nsigh, the best way to do it\nwould be double inhale through the nose,\nexhale through the mouth.\nBut if you can't,\nand you can only do\nthat through your mouth,\njust do it through your mouth.\nIf want to do all through your\nnose, do it through your nose.\nThis anchors back to\nsome underlying neurology\nor neuroscience.\nSo, for those of you that want to know,\nyou have two breathing centers.\nOne that's involved in rhythmic breathing\nfor inhales followed by exhales,\nfollowed by inhales followed by exhales.\nThe so-called pre-Botzinger nucleus\nnamed after a bottle of wine\nand discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA\nand a nearby nucleus called\nthe parafacial nucleus\nalso discovered by Jack Feldman at UCLA.\nAnd the parafacial nucleus is involved\nin any time you double up the inhales\nor double up the exhales.\nIt was designed so that you could breathe\nwhile you're speaking\nbecause you can't always\ngo inhale, exhale,\ninhale, exhale when you're speaking.\nSo, I tell you this, not to\noverwhelm you with knowledge,\nbut just know that when\nyou double up your inhales\nor you double up your exhales,\nyou are activating this\nparafacial nucleus.\nAnd it has other cool effects.\nBecause it's located near the\nneurons that control the face,\nit also has a tendency to relax the jaw.\nThere's some interplay between the neurons\nthat control the speaking stuff\nand the stuff for your tongue.\nSo, all of a sudden, when we\ndo this physiological sigh,\nwe tap into neural\ncircuitry that allows us\nto speak more clearly,\nto control the muscles\nof the face and jaw.\nMaybe that means not saying certain things\nwhen we're stressed,\nand just generally to relax.\nAnd so, this brings us\nback to the neuroscience\nof this parasympathetic nervous system.\nThis calming system that's been\ngenetically encoded into us\nthat we all have, regardless\nof who our parents are,\nwhich is that the neurons\nthat control all this stuff,\nthe face, the eyes, et cetera,\nare all working together.\nAnd that's why when we get stressed,\nit's hard for us to speak\nor we tend to jitter\nand these kinds of things.\nJust like all the\nneurons that cause stress\nin the center of the spinal\ncord are working together\nto get our body activated.\nOkay, lot of science today.\nYou've now got the\nphysiological sigh as a tool.\nYou know the exhale-emphasized breathing\nwill slow your heart down\nand inhale-emphasized breathing\nwill speed your heart up.\nSo, let's think about something now.\nLet's think about stress\nfrom not whether or not\nit's acute or chronic,\nwhether or not it's good\nfor us or bad for us,\nbut on three different timescales.\nBecause then we can arrive\nat what this is all about\nas it relates to emotions.\nBecause trust me, this has\neverything to do with emotions\nand whether or not you're\nfunctioning well emotionally\nor you're not functioning\nwell emotionally,\nwhether or not you're\ncoping or not coping.\nSo, those are typically\npsychological terms\nand psychological discussions.\nWe are entering this through\nthe portal of physiology.\nThe stuff of medical textbooks.\nAnd we will arrive at the psychology soon,\nbut I really want you to\nunderstand the difference\nbetween the three kinds of stress\non three different timescales,\nshort-term, medium-term, and long-term,\nand what it's good for\nand what it's bad for.\nI think we've all heard\nthat stress is bad for us.\nWe've seen these pictures\nintended to frighten us.\nAnd indeed they are frightening.\nYou see the nice really\nplump brain on the left.\nIt says healthy or control.\nAnd then you see the\nbrain that says stressed\nabove it on the right\nand it's like withered,\nwhere we see that the hippocampus\nand area involved in memory is smaller.\nPeople that are stressed.\nWe see that the Alzheimer's\nbrain is made worse by stress.\nThat people who have a\npredisposition to schizophrenia,\nwhen they get stressed,\nhigher incidence of\nschizophrenia episodes.\nYou hear that addicts will\nrelapse when they're stressed.\nI mean, okay, we get it.\nAnd it's very important,\nbut I think we've all\nheard now so many times\nthat stress is bad.\nBut in that conversation, unfortunately,\nit's eclipsed some of the\nreally positive things\nthat stress does for us in the short-term.\nSo, stress can be short-term,\nmedium-term, or long-term.\nLong-term stress is indeed bad\nfor all the reasons I just\nmentioned and many others.\nBut what's never actually been discussed\nis what stress is so terrific for,\npositive for in the short-term.\nAnd I think we tend to overlook\nthe important question,\nwhich is what is short-term\nand what is long-term?\nNo one ever bothers to\ntell us what is chronic,\nwhat is acute.\nRight?\nIs it five minutes?\nIs it five days?\nIs it for the duration of final exams?\nOr is it for the duration of\na senior thesis in college?\nNo one actually draws\nboundaries around this stuff\nor even general guidelines.\nAnd so, it's become a\nbit of a mess, frankly,\nto try and decipher this\nwhole space around stress.\nSo, I'm going to try and\nclean some of this up for you\nbased on what we know\nfrom the scientific data.\nFirst of all, acute stress,\nwhen the stress response hits,\nthat is good for your immune system.\nI know that might be a\ntough pill to swallow,\nbut it's absolutely true.\nIn fact, stress often comes\nin the form of bacterial\nor viral infection.\nAnd the stress response\nis in part organized\nto combat bacterial and viral infection.\nThere are pathways from\nthe same brain centers\nthat activate these\nneurons in your spinal cord\nto make you feel like you want to move.\nThere are other neurons in your brain\nthat activate things like your spleen,\nwhich will deploy killer cells to go out\nand scavenge for incoming\nbacteria and viruses\nand try and eat them up and kill them.\nSo, short-term stress\nand the release of adrenaline\nin particular or epinephrine,\nsame thing, adrenaline and epinephrine,\nis good for combating infection.\nAnd this to me is just\nnot discussed enough.\nSo, that's why I'm discussing it here.\nAnd it relates to a particular tool\nthat many of you ask about,\nbut I don't often get the\nopportunity to talk about\nin such an appropriate context.\nIt's not that it's ever\ninappropriate to talk about,\nbut what I'm about to talk\nabout now is the use of,\nagain, respiration breathing\nto somewhat artificially\nactivate the stress response.\nAnd that will accomplish two things.\nOkay?\nI'll return to medium\nand long-term stress,\nbut I want to say\nshort-term stress is good\nbecause the dilation of the pupils,\nthe changes in the optics of the eyes,\nthe quickening of the heart rate,\nthe sharpening of your cognition.\nAnd in fact that short-term stress\nbrings certain elements\nof the brain online\nthat allow you to focus.\nNow, it narrows your focus.\nYou're not good at seeing\nthe so-called big picture,\nbut it narrows your focus.\nIt allows you to do these,\nwhat I call duration path\noutcome types of analysis.\nIt allows you to evaluate\nyour environment,\nevaluate what you need to do.\nIt primes your whole system\nfor better cognition.\nIt primes your immune\nsystem to combat infection.\nAnd that all makes sense when you think\nabout that the fact that famine, thirst,\nbacterial infections,\nviral infections, invaders,\nall of this stuff liberates\na response in the body\nthat's designed to get you to fight back\nagainst whatever stressor\nthat happens to be.\nPsychological, physical, bacterial, viral.\nAgain, the stress response is generic.\nThe tool takes advantage of the fact\nthat when adrenaline\nis released in the body\nfrom the adrenals,\nit has the effect of also liberating\na lot of these killer cells\nfrom the immune organs,\nin particular from the spleen,\nbut from elsewhere as well,\nand interactions with the lymphatic system\nthat combat infection.\nThe way this works in the\nreal world is best captured\nby a study that can be mapped back\nto so-called Wim Hof breathing.\nNow, Wim Hof breathing is so named\nafter the so-called \"Iceman,\" Wim Hof.\nWim Hof, of course, being this Dutch.\nHe, I think he has self-titled Daredevil.\nAnd indeed he has many, many\nGuinness Book of World Records\nfor things like swimming under icebergs\nand going up Kilimanjaro in his shorts\nand crossing the desert\nwithout water, et cetera.\nThings that are quite dangerous\nif you don't know what you're doing.\nAnd Wim obviously survived or\nI'm telling you he survived.\nBut there are two components\nto a sort of breathing protocol\nthat he developed that was based also\non what's called Tummo\nbreathing, T-U-M-M-O.\nSo, before Wim, there was Tummo breathing.\nAnd many people call this now\nsuper oxygenation breathing.\nAlthough the breath work\naficionados will probably say,\nwell, it's not super oxygenation\nbecause you're also blowing an\nawful lot of carbon dioxide.\nWhat I'm talking about here,\nregardless of whether or not\nit's called Wim Hof, Tummo,\nor super oxygenation, is\nrapid deliberate breathing.\nSo, it's deliberate hyperventilation.\nWhy would somebody want to do this?\nWell, deliberate hyperventilation\ndone for maybe 25 cycles.\nSo inhale, exhale, inhale,\nexhale, inhale, exhale.\nTypically, it's done in through the nose\nout through the mouth.\nAlthough sometimes it's\njust through the mouth.\nIf you do that for 15 breaths,\n20 breaths, 25 breaths,\nyou will feel very alert.\nPeople who have anxiety will feel anxious.\nThey might even have an anxiety attack.\nHowever, we need to ask\nwhy that kind of breathing feels that way.\nAnd it's because that\npattern of breathing,\nrapid movements of the diaphragm\nwill liberate adrenaline\nfrom the adrenals.\nSo, it's the release of adrenaline.\nI mentioned that Wim is\nalso called \"The Iceman.\"\nWell, that's because\nhe actually discovered\nthis pattern of breathing, somewhat.\nAnd again, it maps back to Tummo breathing\nby going into cold water.\nWhen you go into cold water,\nthat too is a stressor\nand you liberate adrenaline\nin response to cold water.\nSo, if you get into an\nice bath or a cold shower,\nyou will immediately release\nadrenaline from your adrenals.\nNow, there are all sorts\nof things related to this\nabout psychological control\nand stress thresholds\nthat we'll talk about,\nbut I really want people to understand\nthat when adrenaline is\nreleased in the body,\nyou are in a better position\nto combat infections.\nAnd so, whether or not\nyou breathe very quickly\nin these cycles of 25 breaths\nand regardless of what you\ncall it, doesn't matter,\nadrenaline is released.\nIf you take a cold shower,\nadrenaline is released.\nIf you go into an ice bath deliberately,\nand even if you do it non-deliberately,\nadrenaline is released.\nYou are mimicking the stress response.\nAnd that adrenaline serves to suppress\nor combat incoming infections.\nAnd this was beautifully shown in a study\nthat was published in a very fine journal,\nthe \"Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences\nfor the US.\"\nIt's literally called\n\"Proceedings of the\nNational Academy of USA\"\nto distinguish it from other proceedings\nof other national academies\nin other countries.\nThe way the experiment went\nis that people were injected\nwith endotoxin or in some\ncases they were injected\nwith a bacterial wall\nthat mimics infection.\nIt gives you a fever.\nIt makes you feel nauseous.\nIt makes you feel sick.\nIt is not pleasant.\nHalf of the people did a\nparticular pattern of breathing\nthat looked very much like\nthe pattern of breathing\nI described a moment ago\nof doing 25 deep inhales\nand exhales followed by an\nexhale holding their breath.\nThen repeating 25 inhales,\nexhales holding their breath.\nSo, this would look something like this,\nor if you're listening,\nit sounds like [inhaling and exhaling].\n25, 30 times, you'll\nstart feeling heated up.\nYou'll start feeling\nthe adrenaline response.\nYou're liberating adrenaline in your body.\nThen exhale, hold your\nbreath for 15 seconds\nand then repeat.\nAnd then typically, after doing three\nor four rounds of that,\nthey would inhale very\ndeeply and hold their breath.\nNow, I want to emphasize\nnever ever, ever do this\nanywhere near water.\nPeople have passed out.\nSo-called shallow water blackout.\nPeople have died.\nDon't do it in the bathtub.\nDon't do it the hot tub.\nDon't do it before swimming.\nPlease don't do it anywhere near water.\nPlease don't do it at all,\nunless you get clearance\nto do it from your doctor\nbecause there are some\npulmonary effects and whatnot.\nAnd the breath holds should\ndefinitely not be done\nby anyone that has glaucoma\npressure concerns for the eyes.\nBut these repeated cycles of breathing\nthat liberate adrenaline\nallowed the group that did that protocol\nto essentially experience zero symptoms\nfrom the ejection of this E.\ncoli, which is remarkable.\nThey had much reduced or no symptoms.\nThey didn't feel feverish.\nThey didn't feel sick.\nThey weren't vomiting, no\ndiarrhea, which is remarkable,\nbut makes total sense when\nyou think about the fact\nthat the short-term stress response there,\nwhat's typically called\nthe acute stress response,\nit's designed to combat all stressors.\nIn fact, were you to\ncut yourself very deeply\nwhile out on a hike in the woods,\nthe other thing that would happen\nis that there would be a\nrapid inflammation response.\nAnd we always hear inflammation is bad.\nInflammation gives us Alzheimer's.\nInflammation is the worst thing.\nBut the swelling is associated,\nthe inflammation is associated\nwith the recruitment\nof things like macrophages\nor microglia if it's a neural tissue.\nCells in our brain and body\nwhose job is to act like little ambulances\nand rush to that site and clean it up.\nAnd indeed the inflammation\nresponse looks horrible,\nit sounds horrible,\nbut it's a great thing in the short-term.\nYou want to have that\ntissue marked as in trouble\nand you want the body\nand brain to react to it.\nSo, if you're getting peaks in stress\nfrom time to time throughout your day\nor throughout your week,\nyou are in a better position\nto combat infection.\nYou are any better position\nto heal your wounds,\nphysical wounds.\nMany great things happen\nin the stress response.\nNow, of course, the stress response\nisn't always super intense.\nSometimes it's milder.\nSometimes it allows us to\njust focus on something\nbecause we have a deadline.\nThat can feel stressful,\nbut that's one of the reasons\nyou procrastinators out there,\npeople are always asking me\nwhat can be done for procrastination?\nWhat can be done for procrastination\nis you can understand what's happening,\nwhich is that you are self-imposing stress\nbecause stress acts like a drug.\nIt is a powerful nootropic.\nI get asked about nootropics.\nThe most powerful nootropic\nor smart drug is stress.\nIt's the concern of failure.\nIt's the desire to do well.\nIt's the impending deadline.\nIt's the, \"Oh my gosh, I\nhave to do this thing now\nor I'm going to fail.\"\nThat is the best nootropic\nyou will ever find.\nThat combined with a good night's sleep,\nwhich we'll talk about.\nBut we spent a whole month on sleep.\nSo, I don't want to backtrack too much.\nOkay.\nSo, short-term stress, great.\nThe key is to be able to\nturn the stress response off\nwhen you're done, when\nyou don't want that.\nIn fact, let's just really tamp down\nthe relationship between the short-term\nor acute stress response and infection.\nMany of us are familiar\nwith the experience\nof work, work, work, work, work,\nor taking care of a loved one,\nor stress, stress, stress,\nstress, then we finally relax.\nMaybe we even go on vacation.\nLike, \"Oh, now I'm finally\ngoing to get the break.\"\nAnd then we get sick.\nAnd that's because the\nadrenaline response crashed\nand your immune system crashed with it.\nSo, please understand this.\nNow, many of you might\nsay, \"Well, how long?\nIs it two hours?\nIs it three hours?\"\nA lot of you out there that\nreally like specificity,\nit will vary for everybody.\nI would just kind of use a rule of thumb.\nWhen you are no longer\nable to achieve good sleep,\nwhat good sleep means to you,\nand please see the episodes on sleep\nif you want more about tools to sleep,\nwhen you are no longer\nable to achieve good sleep,\nyou are now moving from acute\nstress to chronic stress.\nYou need to be able to turn\nthe stress response off.\nIf I have one wish,\nwell, I have many wishes\nfor this lifetime,\nbut if I have one wish today\nthat I hope will permeate\nand spread out there,\nis this idea that we\nneed from a young age,\nbut even as adults and forever,\nwe need to learn how to turn\noff our stress response.\nPhysiological sigh is one.\nIf we're going to activate our\nstress response intentionally\nby ice baths, cold showers,\ncyclic hyperoxygenated\nbreathing, aka Tummo breathing\nor Wim Hof breathing,\nwe also need to learn\nhow to press the brake.\nOkay?\nSo, let's think about the stress system.\nIt knows how to activate itself.\nNow we're talking about a way\nof deliberately activating\nyour stress system\nin order to combat infection.\nI do this from time to time.\nI might feel a tickle in my throat\nor like I'm getting kind of run down,\nI will do this kind of breathing.\nI do.\nI will take 25 or 30 breaths.\nExhale, hold my breath.\n25, 30 breaths again,\nexhale, hold my breath\nfor about 15 seconds.\n25, 30 breaths again,\nexhale, hold my breath\nfor 25 or 30 seconds.\nThen a big inhale.\nAnd I hold my breath until I\nfeel the impulse to breathe.\nAgain, I feel it's safe for me.\nI've run it by my doctor, so it's fine.\nYou should not do this\nunless it's right for you.\nBut I do this.\nSome people like the ice bath.\nI rarely do the ice bath.\nSome people like cold showers.\nI like hot showers.\nSo, I take hot showers, but\nI do this kind of breathing.\nAgain, they are all having\nmore or less the same effect\nof increasing adrenaline,\nwhich allows you to combat the infection\nbecause you're activating\nthe immune response.\nOkay.\nSo, now let's talk about\nmedium-term stress.\nMedium-term stress is going to be stress\nthat lasts anywhere from\nseveral days to several weeks.\nOkay.\nWe might think of that\nas long-term stress.\nThere are times in life when\nwe are just dealing with a lot.\nOkay?\nThis particular quarter,\nI happened to be directing\na course, I'm doing the lab,\nI'm doing this.\nI enjoy all these things immensely,\nbut I'm kind of near my threshold.\nI'm near the point where\nany additional thing,\nlike I couldn't log onto\na website the other day\nand it felt like the most\nintense thing in the world\nat that moment.\nAnd I kind of laughed at myself.\nFortunately, I caught it.\nBut that typically wouldn't be my response\nunder conditions where I\nwasn't pushed to threshold.\nWhat is this medium-term stress?\nWhat is stress threshold?\nWell, stress threshold\nis actually our ability\nto cognitive re-regulate\nwhat's going on in our body.\nSo, we all hear so much about\nwe need to unify our mind\nand body.\nWe need to be at one with our\nmind and body or whatever.\nNow I realize I'm kind of poking fun\nat some of the new agey language,\nbut the reason I poke fun\nis not because I don't think it has value,\nbut it has no specificity.\nWhat does that mean?\nI mean, I think I'm always in my body.\nI've never fortunately\nlooked across the room\nand seen my arm over there\nor my leg over there.\nI'm connected to my body.\nThere actually is a syndrome\nwhere people feel disconnected\nfrom their limbs.\nThis is a real clinical condition.\nThese people actually\nwill seek out amputation.\nThey will try and convince doctors\nto amputate certain\nportions of their body.\nIt's a really terrible\nthing for people to have.\nAnd it relates to a change\nin central maps in the brain,\nbelieve it or not.\nMost of us want to keep our limbs,\nwhichever ones we happen to have.\nAnd most of us feel one in mind and body\nso much so that when stress hits,\nwe feel it in our mind and body.\nA lot of stress inoculation,\na lot of managing medium-term stress\non the timescale of weeks or\nmaybe even a couple months,\nso we're not talking\nabout years of stress,\na lot of that has to do with\nraising our stress threshold.\nIt's about capacity.\nAnd there are very simple\ntools, excellent tools\nthat will allow us to modulate\nour capacity for stress.\nAnd they look a lot like\nthe tools I just described.\nThey involve placing oneself deliberately\ninto a situation where our\nadrenaline is increased somewhat\nnot to the extreme.\nAnd then when we feel\nflooded with adrenaline,\nand normally we would panic,\nit's about cognitively,\nmentally, emotionally\ncalming ourselves and being comfortable\nwith that response in our body.\nSo, unlike trying to\nunify the mind and body\nand make it all calm or make it all alert,\nthis is about dissociating\nmind and body in a healthy way.\nAnd what would this look like?\nWell, this is something I\nactually do as a practice\nbecause I mentioned before,\nyou can use physiological\nsighs in real time,\nyou can use the cyclic\nhyperoxygenation breathing\nto combat infection if you're\nfeeling kind of run down.\nAnd there's also a way\nin which you can use\nthings like cold showers,\nor if you exercise\nand you bring your\nheart rate up very high,\nyou kind of go into that\nhigh-intensity realm\nwhere your heart is\nbeating a little bit harder\nthan you're comfortable with\nand that you're just you feel,\nsome people think it's lactic acid.\nNo one can agree on this what the burn is,\nwhether or not it's lactic acids\nor it's buildup of hydrogen or whatever.\nI don't want to get into\nthat, but we're all familiar\nwith the intense feeling of\nyour muscles kind of burning\nbecause you're working\nvery hard physically.\nThe key in those moments is\nto learn to relax the mind\nwhile the body is very activated.\nAnd what that tends to do,\nthere's a limited amount\nof research on this,\nbut what that tends to do is\nit tends to create a situation\nwhere what once felt like\na lot feels manageable.\nOkay?\nThat you've raised your stress threshold\nor your stress capacity.\nOne way that you can do this,\nand this is kind of fun,\nif it's approved by your physician\nand you're able to do this,\nyou can bring your heart rate up.\nYou can do this through an\nice bath if that's your thing\nor a cold shower or cyclic\noxygenation breathing\nor you could sprint or you\ncould go hard on the bike,\nwhenever it is that\nbrings your heart rate up.\nAnd then what you want to do\nis you want to actually\ntry and calm the mind\nwhile your body is in this\nheightened state of activation.\nAnd the best way that\nI'm aware to do that,\nagain goes back to\nphysiology, not psychology.\nWhen we are stressed, our pupils dilate.\nThe effect of that pupil dilation\nis to create tunnel vision.\nIt literally narrows our\nview of the visual world.\nWe no longer see in Panorama.\nAnd there's some other effects as well.\nBut that's because the visual system\nthrough this cranial nerve\nsystem that I described before\nis tethered and is part of\nthis autonomic nervous system.\nBy deliberately dilating your gaze,\nmeaning not moving your\nhead and eyes around,\nbut by deliberately\ngoing from tunnel vision\nto broader panoramic vision,\nliterally seeing more of\nyour environment all at once.\nYou don't have to do what I'm\ndoing, which is not blinking.\nYou're welcome to blink.\nBut it means deliberately\ndilating your gaze\nso that you can see yourself\nin the environment you're in.\nIt creates a calming effect on the mind\nbecause it releases a particular\ncircuit in the brainstem\nthat's associated with\nalertness, aka stress.\nNow, this is very powerful.\nIf you're running, for instance,\nand you're at max capacity\nor close to it,\nor you're kind of hitting like\n80, 90% of maximum on the bike\nand you dilate your gaze,\nwhat you'll find is the mind can relax\nwhile the body is in full output.\nAnd this relates to work\nthat in various communities,\npeople are working with this\nin the sports community,\nmilitary community, et cetera.\nBut it's a form, not really\nof stress inoculation,\nit's more about raising stress threshold\nso that the body is going to continue\nto be in a high alertness,\nhigh reactivity mode,\nhigh output, but the mind is calm.\nAnd so, this isn't about\nunifying mind and body.\nThis is actually about using body\nto bring up your level of activation,\nthen dissociating,\nnot the clinical dissociation\nkind of disorders,\nbut dissociating the mental\nor emotional response\nfrom what's going on in your body.\nAnd over time, so if you\ndo this a couple of times,\nyou don't have to do this every workout,\nbut if you do this every\nmaybe once a week or so,\nyou start being comfortable\nat these higher activation states.\nWhat once felt overwhelming\nand like a lot of work,\nnow is manageable.\nIt feels tolerable.\nSo, that's for navigating\nmedium-term stress.\nNow, there are other tools as well,\nbut we don't want to go over 90 minutes\nbecause 90 minutes is\none old trading cycle.\nI was trying to keep these\npodcasts to one on trading cycle,\nin case you haven't noticed,\nso you can derive\nmaximum benefit from them\nbased on all trading and\ncycle principles of learning.\nSo, I don't want to go into\nevery little bit of this.\nAnd I want to make sure\nwe get to emotions.\nBut I want to emphasize that\nthese medium-term stressors,\nof, \"Oh, it's been a hard\nmonth, or hard week.\"\nStanford's on the quarter system.\nSo 10 weeks or semester.\nThat becomes more manageable\nwhen we train ourselves\nto be calm of mind when\nour body is activated.\nAnd if you haven't noticed,\nmost of the tools I'm describing today\nare nothing like the sort of,\nokay, sit and do meditation.\nI'm actively avoiding\nsaying the words NSDR,\nnon-sleep deep rest.\nI talked a lot about those tools\nduring the months on\nsleep and neuroplasticity.\nAnd of course, they are wonderful\nfor replenishing your\nability to lean into effort,\nto learn to focus.\nPlease do try and check out NSDR protocol.\nSee if they're right for you.\nThe margins for safety,\nI think are enormous.\nYou're basically just\nlistening to a script.\nWe have links to them\nin previous captions.\nI've talked on them on\nvarious podcasts before.\nWe can provide them again.\nBut today I'm really talking about tools,\nso you can learn to dance with stress.\nTo in the short-term,\nreduce that stress response\na little bit if you feel\nit's too uncomfortable.\nIn the medium-term,\nto be comfortable with these\nheightened levels of activation\nbecause life is going to\ncontinue to come at you.\nAnd we can't pick the stressors,\nbut we need to be able to function\nat a higher capacity often.\nAnd then there's long-term stress.\nNow, long-term stress is bad.\nYou do not want adrenaline\nup in your system\nfor a very long time.\nIn fact, you ideally, you\nwould have your stress go up\nvarious times throughout the day,\nbut it would never stay elevated\nand it would never prevent you\nfrom getting a good night's sleep.\nNow, that isn't realistic.\nOkay?\nI would say for me, three,\nfour nights out of the month,\nno matter what I do, I take on too much\nor something happens in life is life\nand I don't get the best night's sleep\nthat I would like to get.\nFor many of you, it's 30 nights per month.\nFor some of you, it's\nzero nights per month.\nAnd congratulations to you\nzero nights per month people.\nIf you are managing your\nsleep really well every night,\nthat is fantastic.\nYou really want to be able\nto fall asleep at night,\nstay asleep for most of the night.\nAnd if you get up, go back to sleep\nfor as long as you need to\nin order to feel rested.\nThat's what I define as a\nhealthy relationship to sleep.\nCheck out the episodes on sleep\nif you want tools to be\nable to accomplish that.\nAnd we can all accomplish that.\nIt can be done.\nAnd there are tools to do it.\nZero-cost tools.\nOkay, so let's talk\nabout long-term stress.\nEarlier, I talked about how breathing\ncan modulate heart rate through this loop\nthat includes the brain\nand the parasympathetic nervous system.\nI don't think I mentioned this,\nand I want to make sure that I mentioned\nthat breathing controlling heart rate\nthrough the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous system\nis the basis of what's called\nHRV, heart rate variability.\nAnd we know that heart\nrate variability is good.\nYou don't want your heart\nrate chronically elevated\nor chronically low.\nA lot of people think,\n\"Oh, I want a really nice low heart rate.\"\nAnd indeed, if you're in shape,\nthe stroke volume of your\nheart will be greater\nand you can have a nice slow heart rate.\nYears ago when I was running regularly,\nI think my heart rate\nwas down to like 50 or 60\nor something like that.\nThat's great.\nBut, and now it's higher than that\nbecause I'm running a little bit less.\nBut everyone needs to determine\nwhat's right for them.\nBut you don't really want your heart rate\nto be chronically low or chronically high.\nBoth are bad.\nWe know that chronic\nstress, elevated stress\nand especially in the\nso-called type A personalities\ncreates heart disease,\nthe leading killer of for\nin most, every country,\nbut in particular in the US.\nBecause of the way that adrenaline\nimpacts those blood vessels\nor constricting some\nand dilating others,\nit's just that kind of hypertension,\nchronic hypertension is just bad.\nAnd so, chronic stress truly is bad.\nI want to really make that clear\nbecause I emphasized a lot\nof what some of the\npositive effects of stress.\nBut you want to be able\nto tamp down your stress in real time.\nYou also want to be able\nto modulate your stress\nand your emotional relationship\nto stress in the body\nin the medium-term,\nbut by no means do you\nwant to be stressed out\nall the time, chronically for\nmonths and months and months\nand years on end.\nThe best tools, the best mechanisms\nthat we know to modulate long-term stress\nmight surprise you a little bit.\nFirst of all, there are\ngoing to be the things\nthat don't surprise you,\nwhich is everyone knows\ngetting regular exercise,\ngetting good sleep, using real-time tools\nto try and tamp down the\nstress response, et cetera,\nthat's all going to be really useful.\nThe data really points to the\nfact that social connection\nand certain types of social\nconnection in particular\nare what are going to mitigate\nor reduce long-term stress.\nAnd this is a particularly\nimportant issue nowadays\nwhere we have all these proxies\nor surrogates for social connection.\nWe're online and texting\nwith people a lot,\nso we can feel connected.\nLike the plane's about to take off\nand everyone's texting each other\nwhether or not they have\nfear of flying or not.\nThey're like, \"Okay, see you.\nLove you.\nHate you.\"\nWhatever it is that they're\ntrying to communicate to people.\nThen plane lands, every phone's out,\n\"See you.\nLove you.\nHate you.\"\nLet's hope it's fewer hate yous.\nBut everyone has this kind of need\nto stay connected to one another.\nHumans are incredibly social creatures.\nNow, there is a way to look\nat this whole business\nof social connection,\nnot from just the kind of\nwishy-washy new agey perspective.\nAnd I want to point out\nthat sometimes I'll say\nwishy-washy new agey.\nI have nothing against that.\nI just, my goal here is\nalways to put scientific data\nand some neurochemistry on\nthings so that for those of you\nthat are into wishy-washy new agey stuff,\nyou also can arm yourself\nwith some arguments\nfor those of the members of\nyour family and your life\nthat maybe aren't so tuned\ninto the typical language\naround those practices like,\n\"Oh, connection is really key.\nWe all get oxytocin.\"\nActually, did you know that\nconnection between individuals\nrarely causes the release of oxytocin?\nOxytocin is released in very\nparticular circumstances\nlike post-orgasm, baby\nand mother milk let down.\nIt's associated with\nkind of really intense\nkinds of pair bonding\nthings of mother and child.\nAlso father and child, but\nespecially mother and child,\nbecause its relationship\nto the lactation system.\nCouples post-sex.\nThese kinds of things that reflect deep\nkind of layers of our biology.\nAnd oxytocin is not just\nreleased when we walk in\nand pat the dog on the head\nor we see somebody and\nwe give them a hug and,\n\"Hi, great to see you,\" fist bump.\nThat's not a situation for oxytocin.\nThe way to think about social connection\nand how it can mitigate\nsome of the long-term effects of stress\nis really through the\nsystems of neuromodulation\nlike serotonin,\nand through blocking certain things\nthat are really bad for us\nwhen we feel socially isolated.\nThings like Taqi Kynan.\nSo, let me explain what these are.\nSerotonin again, is a neuromodulator.\nNeuromodulators are a little bit\nlike playlists in the brain.\nThey tend to amplify\nor bias the likelihood\nthat certain brain\ncircuits and body circuits\nare going to be activated\nand that others will not.\nSerotonin generally,\nand I realize I'm speaking\nvery generally here,\nbut it generally gives\nus feelings of wellbeing.\nAt very high levels,\nit makes us feel blissed\nand it tends to make us feel\nlike we have enough in\nour immediate environment.\nThis is why some of the side\neffects of antidepressants\nthat elevate serotonin,\nand actually can help a lot of people\nwith depressive symptoms.\nBut the side effects associated with drugs\nthat increase serotonin\ntend to be reduced affect.\nThey tend to kind of blunt affect\nor make people feel like\ntheir libido is lower.\nDesire goes down because the\nbody has so much serotonin\nand the brain has so much serotonin,\nthat one feels like they have enough.\nBut serotonin, pharmacology aside\nor taking antidepressants\naside a topic for another time,\nserotonin tends to make us feel good.\nWhen we see somebody that\nwe recognize and trust,\nserotonin is released in the brain.\nAnd that has certain positive\neffects on the immune system\nand on other systems of\nneural repair and synopsis\nand things that really reinforce\nconnections in the brain\nand prevent that long-term\nwithering of connections.\nSo, serotonin is tied\nto social connection.\nNow, social connection\ncan take many forms.\nAs many of you know, I am\nvery attached to my dog.\nI hope he's attached to me.\nHe's asleep most of the time.\nSo, I don't know.\nAnd even if he was awake,\nI don't really know what I would ask him.\nBut he seems more or less to\nbe attached to me as well.\nAnd there's no scientific evidence\nthat it has to be human-human attachment.\nI do have attachments to humans as well.\nBut you can have\nattachments to other people.\nSome of those can be romantic attachments.\nThey could be familial\nattachments that are non-romantic,\nfriendship, pets, even\nattachments to things\nthat just delight us.\nOne of the things that really can mitigate\nagainst the long-term negative effects\nof chronic long-term stress\nisn't just having fun.\nWe hear all this stuff, \"You\nneed to play and have fun.\"\nThat can be a little\nbit of a tough concept,\nespecially for the hard driving people\nor people that are stressed,\nbut having a sense of delight,\na sense of really enjoying\nsomething that you see\nand engage in, witness, or participate in,\nthat is associated with\nthe serotonin system.\nAnd certainly, play is\none of those things.\nSocial connection of various forms.\nThose are things to invest in.\nSome people might say, \"Well,\nnobody wants to be my friend,\"\nor, \"Nobody wants to\nengage socially anymore.\"\nI'll be the first to admit,\nsocial connection and friendship\nand relationships of all\nkinds to animals or humans\nor inanimate objects takes work.\nIt takes investment.\nIt takes time in not needing everything\nto be exactly the way you want it to be.\nI have a friend who struggles with this\nand oftentimes the\nconversations just circle back\nto the fact that when you\nwant social connection,\nyou often have to be more flexible.\nYou have to eat on other\npeople's schedules.\nSometimes you have to eat things\nyou don't necessarily want to\neat the most in that moment\nor stay up a little later\nor wake up a little earlier.\nSocial connection is\nsomething that we work for,\nbut it is incredibly powerful.\nI want to, of course, tip my heart to,\nit's only appropriate to call\nhim the great Robert Sapolsky,\nmy colleague who I'm\nunfortunate to know at Stanford.\nOf course, he has talked\nabout this quite a lot.\nSo, I want to acknowledge\nRobert's incredible work\nand discussions around this.\nYou can look up those materials online\nand his wonderful books.\nBut primates, and we are\nprimates, we are social species.\nAnd as Robert has said many times before,\nnever before in any primate history,\nbut in particular in human history\nhave we interacted with so\nmany strangers at a distance\nwhen we are not really connected to them.\nSo, finding just a few\npeople, even one or an animal\nor something that you delight in,\nbelieve it or not, has\nvery positive effects\non mitigating this long-term stress\non improving various aspects of our life\nas it relates to stress and emotionality.\nSo, that's the social connection part.\nThe other thing is the social\nisolation that goes too long\nis associated in everything\nfrom flies, believe it or not,\nto mice and humans with\nthis molecule of Taqi Kynan.\nTaqi Kynan is a molecule\nthat makes us more fearful,\nparanoid, and impairs our immune system.\nAnd so, Taqi Kynan is like this\ninternal punishment signal.\nIt's like our body and\nour brain telling us,\n\"You're not spending enough time\nwith people that you really trust.\nYou're not spending time doing things\nthat you really enjoy.\"\nAnd I often think about\nTaqi Kynan for myself\nbecause I'm pretty hard driving.\nI have a lot of pursuits.\nI also have a lot of wonderful people\nand an incredibly wonderful\nbulldog in my life,\nbut there are times when\nI can be so goal-directed\nand so in motion and trying\nto accomplish everything,\nthat I sometimes forget about Taqi Kynan.\nAnd I like to remind myself so much so\nthat I actually have a\nlittle post-it above my desk\nthat says, \"Taqi Kynan,\" to\nremind me that Taqi Kynan\nis this very sinister molecule\nthat starts being secreted\nwhen we are not socially connected enough.\nAnd this is why long meals\nwith friends or family\nwhere there are,\nwe'll talk about phones in a moment,\nbut where there's no intrusions,\nor even if there are, just\nfeeling like we are connected\nsuppresses Taqi Kynan.\nAnd Taqi Kynan is something\nyou really want to avoid\nbecause chronic isolation,\nchronically high Taqi Kynan\nthat's associated with long-term stress\nreally depletes so many good\nfunctions of our brain and body\nand promote so many bad\nones including irritability,\nparanoia, fear, et cetera.\nThat is really something to avoid.\nAnd so, I want to highlight Taqi Kynan\nas something to avoid.\nI don't want to completely\ndisregard oxytocin.\nIt's just, the oxytocin has\nbeen built up a lot in the media\nand really serotonin works\non much faster timescales.\nNow, how do you know if\nyou're making serotonin?\nAnd you don't know in the moment,\nbut you can learn if you pay attention\nto kind of recognize these feelings\nof comfort, trust, bliss, delight.\nAnd those are not weak terms.\nThose are not associated just\nwith psychological terms.\nThey are every bit as physiological\nas the movement of your muscles\nor the secretion of adrenaline.\nAnd many people focus now on gratitude.\nGratitude is a little bit subjective.\nAnd here we're moving from some objective\nto kind of subjective things,\nbut recognizing, and in particular,\nwriting down things that\nyou're thankful for,\nhowever small, they may seem,\ndoes seem to have a positive\neffect on the serotonin system.\nNow, there are a plethora of things\nthat will also impact wellbeing\nand allow you to modulate\nyour long-term stress.\nReduce the likelihood that you'll engage\nin long-term stress.\nAnd we don't have time\nto go into all these,\nbut of course, finding\nthe diet and nutrition\nthat's right for you,\nthe exercise schedule\nthat's right for you,\nthe sleep schedule, all that.\nBut do not underemphasize\nthe social connection part, please.\nAs well, there are some compounds\nthat are not antidepressants.\nAlthough if you need antidepressants,\nthen a clinician prescribes them to you.\nPlease follow their advice if\nthat's what is right for you.\nThere are compounds that are\nnot prescription compounds\nthat can modulate the stress system.\nAnd sometimes because\nof the way that life is,\nwe just don't have the\nopportunity to control life\nand to control our response to stress.\nAnd at least for myself,\nI can only talk about my own experience,\nI found it useful in\ntimes of chronic stress\nto start modulating some\nof the neurochemistry\nrelated to the stress\nresponse in order to help.\nNow, if a doctor prescribes you prednisone\nor prescribes you some\nother hormone or something,\nthat's important,\nbut what I'm talking about now\nare non-prescription things.\nYou should check out examine.com,\nthis free website which will allow you\nto put in any supplement\nand evaluate that supplement\nwith they provide links in the\nso-called human effect matrix\nto PubMed.\nIt tells you the exact\nsubjects they were done in.\nIt was a post-menopausal women.\nWas it kids?\nWas it normal adults?\nWas it people with autism, et cetera.\nCheck out that site for\nany and all supplements\nyou're considering or taking.\nI highly recommend it.\nI've no relationship to them.\nI just think it's a wonderful site\nthat's curated all this\nimportant information.\nBut some of these compounds\nare effective enough.\nThey can kind of take the edge off.\nAnd I'll use them periodically myself.\nAnd so, I just thought I'd mentioned them\nsince there a number of you\nthat are interested in them.\nThe three I want to focus on\nand one that I think you\nneed to be cautious about\nthat I've mentioned before,\ninclude ashwagandha, funny name,\nbut that's what's it's called,\nL-theanine or theanine it's\noften called, and melatonin.\nLet's talk about melatonin first.\nMelatonin I talked about\nduring the month on sleep.\nMelatonin is a hormone\nsecreted from the pineal\nin direct relationship to\nhow much darkness you are in.\nNot emotional darkness.\nBut light suppresses melatonin.\nMelatonin helps you fall asleep.\nIt doesn't help you stay asleep.\nI personally do not recommend\nsupplementing melatonin\nbecause it's supplemented\ntypically at very high levels.\nOne to three milligrams or even more\nthat is an outrageously high dose.\nIt's super, super physiological\ncompared to what you normally would make.\nIt also has a number of\npotentially negative effects\non the reproductive\naccess and hormones there.\nSome people can take it without problems.\nIf you like it and\nthat's your thing, fine.\nI just want to cue to the\nfact that there can be issues.\nYou should check on examine.com.\nTalk to your doctor, especially in kids,\nbecause melatonin suppresses\nthe puberty response\nin a number of species.\nEnough about the negative\nthings in melatonin\nexcept that people who take\ntoo much melatonin chronically,\noftentimes when they're taking it to sleep\nor for whatever reason,\nyes, it can reduce anxiety and stress,\nbut it also can reduce\nthe output of the adrenals\nto the point where it\ncan become problematic.\nNow, a note about adrenal burnout.\nThere is actually no such\nthing as adrenal burnout\nunder normal conditions.\nThe adrenals have enough adrenaline\nto support 200 years of\nstress for better, for worse.\nThe concept of adrenal burnout has origins\nin the work of Nobel\nPrize winner, Hans Selye,\nwho actually discovered\nwhat he called the general\nadaptation syndrome.\nHe discovered a lot of\nthings about stress.\nHe did some phenomenal work\nthat turned out to be true.\nThat we have stressors.\nThere's something called distress.\nHe talked about eustress,\nwhich is positive stress.\nEustress has never really caught on\nin the kind of more general discussion.\nBut he had this theory that\nif stress went on long enough,\nthat you would eventually reach\na phase called exhaustion.\nAnd that turned out to be wrong.\nAlthough many of you may feel exhausted\nafter chronic stress,\nthere isn't really a physiological\nexhaustion that happens.\nAnd that eventually got picked up\nand ran with the general public.\nAnd they talk about adrenal burnout.\nToo much coffee, adrenal burnout.\nYou hear all this stuff.\nThere is no such thing as adrenal burnout.\nThe adrenals don't burn out.\nThere is something, however,\ncalled adrenal insufficiency syndrome,\nwhich is a real physiological problem\nwhere some people have\nvery impaired adrenals\nand they can't produce adrenaline.\nAnd melatonin taken at very high levels\nfor periods of time that are too long\ncan cause suppression of the cortisol\nand epinephrine released from the adrenals\nand can create a kind of pseudo\nadrenal insufficiency syndrome.\nSo, be aware of melatonin for that reason.\nPlease, I'm trying,\nI alone can't get rid of\nthe phrase adrenal burnout.\nI'm not trying to give a hard time\nto anyone who feels\nburnt out or exhausted,\nbut it is for other reasons.\nIt is not because of the\nadrenals are burnt out.\nUnless you happen to have\nadrenal insufficiency syndrome.\nSo, I'm not a fan of melatonin\nfor a lot of reasons.\nNow I've mentioned several.\nThe other is L-theanine.\nI've talked about L-theanine,\nwhich provided it's safe for you,\ncan be taken 100 milligrams\nor 200 milligrams\nabout 30 minutes or 60\nminutes before sleep.\nIt can enhance the transition to sleep\nand depth of sleep for many people.\nIt increases GABA,\nthis inhibitory\nneurotransmitter in the brain.\nIt tends to turn off our\nforebrain a little bit\nor reduce the activity of\nour kind of thinking systems\nand ruminating systems\nhelp people fall asleep.\nThat's for sleep.\nBut theanine has also been shown\nfor people that are chronically anxious\nor chronically stressed to,\nif you look at the studies,\nI have a large collection of studies\nin front of me right now,\nif you want to see those links,\nI know if you want\nthose, go to examine.com,\nput in theanine.\nThey linked, for instance, it is known\nto significantly increase relaxation.\nThere are four studies listed\nthere with PubMed links.\nIt is known to have a\nminor effect on anxiety,\nbut eight studies have shown that.\nWhich I think is a fairly\nlarge set of studies.\nSome of them in great journals.\nIt also can reduce task\ncompletion anxiety.\nSo, anxiety related to task completion.\nNot good for the procrastinators perhaps,\nbut for those of you that\nare chronically stressed.\nIt can increase attention a little bit,\nit can reduce blood pressure a little bit,\nimprove sleep quality, et cetera.\nIt definitely has a\nnotable effect on stress,\ntwo studies in particular,\nthat it can notably reduce\nthe effects of stress.\nSo, there's a lot there.\nIt also has effects on insomnia,\non some blood lipid profiles.\nAnd so, go to examine.com\nand check it out.\nBut this is one reason why I\nsupplement theanine for sleep.\nBut if I'm feeling like I've\nbeen under a lot of stress\nand I'm not managing my stress\nvery well with the short-term\nand medium-term tools that\nI talked about earlier,\nI might start taking a\nlittle bit of theanine\nespecially in the late afternoon,\nwhich is when I tend to start to feel\nlike I haven't gotten enough done\nand the day is kind of carrying on.\nAnd so, you can blunt the\nresponse to stress a little bit,\nwhich is why a lot of companies\nare now putting theanine\ninto energy drinks.\nI am not a big fan of most energy drinks.\nMost of them have taurine,\nwhich I know some of you\nwrote to me and said,\n\"Oh, taurine is great\nfor all these reasons.\"\nTaurine also has effects\non the microvasculature\nthat at least for me, were not good.\nIt cause bursting of\nmicrovasculature in my sclera,\nin my eyes, which is why I'm\nnot a fan of any energy drink\nthat has taurine or taurine generally.\nBut that's just me.\nYou have to decide for you.\nI'm sure in the comment section,\nthere'll be a couple of\ntaurinesters out there\nthat will say, \"But I love taurine.\"\nGreat.\nKeep the taurine companies in business.\nBut it's not for me.\nAnd I'd like people to know\nthat it may or may not be for them.\nThe other supplement that can\nbe very useful is ashwagandha.\nAshwagandha is known to\nlower anxiety and cortisol.\nThere is six, there are,\nexcuse me, six studies\nthat collectively show\nreductions in cortisol,\nwhich is cortisol is typically associated\nwith waking up in the\nmorning, which is good.\nThat's a healthy, brief\ncortisol bump that goes away\nprovided you're getting your\nlight at the right time of days\nat correct times of day,\nlike morning and evening.\nBut you don't want cortisol\nchronically elevated.\nThat's associated with all\nthe bad stuff about stress.\nThere's a very strong\neffect of ashwagandha.\nYou can find dosages at examine.com.\nThey report in across six\nstudies, 14.5 to 27.9 reduction\nin cortisol in otherwise healthy,\nbut stressed individuals.\nNow, I don't know about kids.\nYou have to look at what it\nsays on various supplements.\nMost things here are being done in adults.\nSo, please check carefully.\nBut this is great.\nI mean, the opportunity for me anyway,\nto be able to take something\nthat can help me reduce my cortisol\nso that I don't get some of the\nlong-term effects of stress.\nAnd I'm not going to take\nashwagandha year round.\nI would only do this if I was feeling\nlike I wasn't managing my short\nand medium-term stress well.\nSo, I don't take it on a regular basis.\nI do take it when I'm in these times\nwhen things are particularly stressful.\nIt has their five other studies\nthat show reduced stress.\nSo, that's not cortisol measurements,\nbut things like fatigue,\ncognitive impairment, et cetera.\nIt does lower total cholesterol,\nwhich may or may not be good\nor bad for you up to 10%.\nSo, some people don't want\ntheir cholesterol lowered.\nSome people might.\nCholesterol, we'll talk about\nthis in a month on hormones,\nbut cholesterol is the molecule\nfrom which testosterone\nand estrogen and cortisol for\nthat matter are synthesized.\nSo, you don't want to get\nyour cholesterol so low,\nthen there are all sorts\nof negative effects,\nbut you don't want it too high either.\nMild effects in good clinical studies\non reducing depression,\nprobably associated with\nthe effects on stress\nand some other things as well.\nSo, ashwagandha is something\nI use from time to time.\nIt's kind of interesting.\nL-theanine, I rarely will\nuse those during the daytime,\nexcept under conditions\nwhere I'm feeling chronically stressed.\nSo, check out the human\neffect matrix on examine.com.\nAgain, a phenomenal website.\nI think I've sent them\na few emails before.\nThat's the only exchanges\nI've ever had with them.\nBut I just think it's wonderful\nthat they put together this resource.\nOtherwise we'd be stuck mining PubMed.\nThey've collated the papers from PubMed\nwith links to PubMed.\nSo, terrific resource.\nSo, social connection\nand some supplementation.\nOf course, diet, exercise,\nsleep for long-term stress.\nAnd now we're finally in\na position to talk about\nwhat we have set out to\ndo from the beginning,\nwhich is spend the month on emotions.\nIt was very important\nthat we discuss stress\nand we discuss in the\ncontext of short, medium,\nand long-term stress.\nThat we discuss tools for\nshort-term, medium-term,\nand long-term control.\nI don't really want to\nsay mitigation of stress.\nStress is going to happen.\nBut our ability to modulate\nand control stress in real time\noffline using tools such as respiration,\nusing tools such as dilation of gaze,\nusing tools like social\nconnection, maybe some supplements,\ncertainly take care of your sleep\nand nutrition and exercise.\nAgain, tons of resources\nand information in the sleep episodes.\nSo, you can look there.\nWe will do a month on hormones,\non exercise, et cetera.\nBut let's talk about emotions\nbecause in subsequent episodes,\nwe're going to talk about OCD,\nwe're going to talk about depression,\nwe're going to talk about mania,\nwe're going to be talking about dopamine\nand all sorts of things.\nBut at the core of\nemotions is this question,\nwhat is an emotion?\nWell, it's complex.\nThere isn't a single brain area\nfor any one of these things\nthat we call emotions.\nMy framework, and I\nthink the modern science,\nboth psychology and neuroscience\nis pretty well-aligned\nwith what Lisa Feldman\nBarrett has taught about.\nNow, Lisa's at Northeastern University.\nShe runs a big lab there.\nShe's a world expert in emotion.\nShe's written two books\nthat are really wonderful.\nOne is \"How Emotions Are Made,\"\nwhich was her first book.\nThe second one is \"Seven and\na Half Facts About the Brain.\"\nIt's a wonderful book as well.\nIt came out more recently.\nI hosted Lisa on an Instagram live once.\nMaybe we'll get her here on\nthe podcast if we're lucky.\nWe don't agree on everything\nabout the neuroscience of emotions,\nbut I subscribed to most everything\nthat I've heard Lisa say.\nIn particular, the fact that\nemotions are context-dependent.\nThere's a cultural dependence, et cetera.\nI look at things mainly\nthrough the lens of\nphysiology and neuroscience\nand kind of low-level circuitry.\nAnd one way to think about emotions\nthat I think is consistent\nand I think Lisa would generally approve,\nI can't speak for her,\nbut I would hope she\nwould generally approve\nof this description,\nis that when our internal\nstate of stress or calm\nmatches the demands on us\nor is mismatched from the demands on us,\nwe tend to interpret those as good or bad.\nLet me give you an example.\nIf I am feeling very anxious,\nvery stressed inside,\nand I have a lot to do,\nthat doesn't feel good, but\nit's really no different\nthan if I'm very tired\nand I have a lot to do\nbecause there's this mismatch.\nI'm not in the right internal state,\nmy internal state is incorrect rather,\nto meet the demands that\nare being placed upon me.\nSo, in both cases, whether I'm too tired\nor I'm too stressed to\ndo what I need to do,\nthe valence, meaning the\nvalue that I assigned to that\nis I don't feel good.\nIt's not a good situation\nand I don't feel good.\nNow, I might call it stressed,\nI might call it anxious,\nI might call it worried, I might\ncall it a number of things,\nbut it's not good.\nHowever, when I'm tired\nand I want to fall asleep,\nwell then I feel good because\nthat's what the demand is.\nI need to go to sleep and I'm tired.\nIf I'm wide awake and\nI need to fall asleep,\nthen that's not good.\nAnd then the brain tends\nto go down the direction\nof interpreting the\nsituation as a bad one.\nSo, while the discussion around\nemotions is far more nuanced\nand more elaborate than this,\none way to think about your\nrelationship to emotions\nis whether or not your internal state\nis matching the demands that are upon you.\nSo, in that way, we don't\nreally place so much value\non whether or not we're\nfeeling alert or sleepy.\nWe only place value on\nwhether or not that alertness\nwhether or not it's\nfull-blown stress or not\nor our sleepiness, whether\nor not we're falling asleep\nor just a little bit drowsy,\nwhether or not that matches\nthe conditions that we face.\nAnd it's a useful framework to have.\nAnd it's the reason in part\nwhy I spent this last\nhour and a half or so\ntalking about stress and\nhow to control stress.\nOne reason we did that is\nbecause I think it's\na valuable opportunity\nto learn some tools and understand stress\nand really learn how to\ntake control of stress,\nwhich I think we could all benefit\nfrom doing regardless of age.\nThe other reason is that\nwhen you start to understand\nthat you have this kind of\nsee-saw system in your body,\nthis autonomic nervous\nsystem that takes you\nfrom alert and calm to\nstressed to full-blown panic,\nit has that capacity,\nor from sleepy and drowsy\nto passing out tired\nto God forbid, let's hope\nnever, but a coma, right?\nThat you're basically on\nthis see-saw all the time.\nAnd where you are on that\nsee-saw of alertness or calmness\npositions you to be in better reaction\nto the demands that you face.\nWhether or not the thing that you face\nis a need to fall asleep or to\nlisten quietly and not react.\nYou now know, for instance,\nthat if your job is to take feedback,\nwhen maybe you're going\nin for a job evaluation\nor you're in a relationship\nwhere there was a call for a discussion\nand somebody needs to talk\nto you about something\nand we need to talk about something,\nyou're going to there you're like,\n\"Goodness, this is going to be rough.\"\nLearning to reduce that\nstress response a little bit\nso that you are in a position to hear\nthe information better,\nand remember, from a previous episode,\nif you close your eyes,\nyou'll be able to actually\nfocus on the information better.\nThere's your permission to\nnot look someone directly\nin the eye when they talk to you\nif you really want to hear\nwhat they have to say.\nYou will be able to modulate\nthat stress response\nand lean into life better.\nYou will be able to react to\nthings in a more effective way\nand to not be reactive.\nAnd this is really one of the\nimportant things to me anyway,\nis that so much of the\nlanguage around psychology,\nwhich I think is a wonderful field,\nbut pop psychology in\nparticular is be responsive,\nnot reactive.\nWell, great.\nBut then how does one do that?\nWell, one does that\nby modulating their short-term\nstress response in real time.\nNot by saying, \"Hold\non, I need to meditate.\nHold on, I need a massage\nand then I can have this conversation.\"\nBy modulating the reactivity in real time.\nHow does one, for instance, be mindful?\nWhich is a beautiful concept,\nbut how are you mindful?\nWell, I don't know, when\nI'm moving through my day,\na lot of times I'm just\ntrying to get things done.\nAnd as soon as I start monitoring\nand seeing what I'm doing\nand kind of third-personing\nwhat I'm doing,\nit actually takes me\nout of the effectiveness\nand experience of what I'm doing.\nSo for me, sometimes that mindfulness,\nthat observer, as they call it,\nis something that doesn't help me.\nIt actually hinders me.\nWhat's important to me is\nto be able to work and focus\nand then to be able to disengage.\nTo be able to do a non-sleep depressed\nor to be able to still fall asleep\neven though I've been\nworking hard until 9:30\nto put my head down at 10 o'clock\nand be out cold sleeping by 10:02.\nThat's possible if you can learn\nto control this stress response.\nAnd to do that, we can't\nuse the mind to control.\nThe mind, we need tools.\nAnd so, a lot of the people being grumpy\nor anxious or depressed,\na lot of that,\nprovided it's not for some\nunderlying neurochemical reason\nthat's chronic,\na lot of that come from\nbeing poorly rested,\nfrom overworked, from\nfeeling like the world\nis bearing down on us.\nAnd so, rather than take\na subjective view of this,\nI take the view of objective physiology.\nWhat can we do that's anchored\nto these neuronal systems\nin our body, in our brain, in our eyes,\nin our diaphragm, et cetera,\nand look to those as tools leavers\nthat we can pull on and push\nand maneuver through life in a way\nwhere we start to feel\nlike we have some agency.\nWe actually have some real control\nbecause we're controlling\nthe internal landscape.\nSo, I think that ought to set the stage\nfor where we're headed next,\nwhich is to talk about all the things\nthat you normally think of\nwhen you think of emotions,\nlike happiness, like awe, like joy.\nAnd we will get into some of that.\nBut all of that rests\nfirmly on the foundation\nof this thing we call the\nautonomic nervous system.\nThis stress modulation.\nThis calming modulation system.\nAnd again, whether or not\nyou're activated or you're calm\nis not good or bad, it\ndepends on the situation.\nCertainly, when you want to fall asleep,\nbeing activated isn't good.\nWhen you have work to do,\nbeing activated is great.\nSo, I hope today you were able to take\na slightly different view of\nthis thing that we call stress.\nNot just see it as evil,\nbut see it as powerful\nand useful in certain contexts.\nGreat for us in certain contexts\nand problematic in other contexts.\nAnd as well to think\nabout the various tools\nthat I've presented that\ncan allow you to adjust\nand modulate your internal\nlevels of alertness or calmness\nso that you can lean more\neffectively into life,\nwhich includes sleep and social connection\nand the work you have to do.\nAnd of course, acknowledges\nthat the events in the world\nare beyond our control.\nWhat's in our control\nis how we react to them.\nSomething that's commonly said\nin the wellness and self-help\nand psychology world,\nbut for which there often\naren't as many concrete tools\nthat we can really look\nto and trust in real time.\nAnd of course, there are\nother tools out there.\nAs always, I'll say it,\nI strive to be accurate,\nbut I'll never be exhaustive.\nI might have exhausted you.\nI might've cured your insomnia\nwith this discussion today,\nbut in all seriousness,\nmy goal is to bring you\ntools and information\nso that you can manage\nbetter through life.\nSo, thanks so much.\nI very much want to thank all of you\nfor your support for the podcast.\nIt's really been wonderful.\nIf you've subscribed to the podcast\non YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,\nor maybe even all three, terrific.\nIf you haven't, please do subscribe\non YouTube, Apple, or Spotify,\nor maybe even all three,\nwhich would be wonderful.\nOn Apple, you

benefit\nfrom the information,\nmaybe even send them\nthe links if you like,\nthat's tremendously helpful.\nToday, as in previous episodes,\nI've touched on some things\nas they relate to supplementation.\nAs always, I always cover a lot of tools\nthat are zero-cost tools\nthat don't involve\ningesting anything at all,\nbehavioral tools.\nBut I mentioned some supplements\nthat I particularly find useful.\nWith supplements, it's\na complicated landscape,\noften because many supplement companies\ndon't put in the bottle\nwhat they say is in\nthe particular product.\nWe've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,\nbecause Thorne is a supplement company\nthat we know to have the\nhighest levels of stringency.\nIt's used by the Mayo Clinic.\nIt's used by all the\nmajor sports organizations\nfor that particular reason\nand because their quality\nstandards are exceptionally high.\nIf you'd like to try any supplements\nand see the ones that I\ntake, you can go to Thorne,\nthorne.com/u/huberman.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll get 20% off anything\nthat's listed there on my page\nas well as any of the\nsupplements that Thorne sells.\nSo that's Thorne, thorne.com/u/huberman\nto get 20% off anything that Thorne sells.\nIn addition, if you want\nto follow us on Twitter\nwe're there @hubermanlab or\nan Instagram @hubermanlab.\nI also do some content on \"Huberman Lab,\"\na little neuroscience posts.\nSome are reposts of\nclips from the podcast.\nOthers are unique content\nthat you won't find on the podcast.\nSo you can follow us @hubermanlab.\nAlso, if you like check out our Patreon,\npatreon.com/AndrewHuberman.\nAnd most of all, and as always,\nreally appreciate your\ntime and attention today.\nI hope you practice some of the tools\nif they're right for you.\nI hope you think hard about stress\nand how you can control your stress.\nAnd above all, as always,\nthank you for your interest in science.\n[upbeat music]"
