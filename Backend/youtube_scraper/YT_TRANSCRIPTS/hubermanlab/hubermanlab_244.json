Neurobiology\nand Ophthalmology at\nStanford School of Medicine.\nThis podcast is separate\nfrom my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford.\nIt is however, part of\nmy desire and effort\nto bring zero cost to consumer information\nabout science and science-related tools\nto the general public.\nAlong those lines,\nI want to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast.\nOur first sponsor is Athletic\nGreens, which is an all-in-one\nvitamin mineral probiotic\nliquid supplement.\nI've been using Athletic Greens since 2012\nbecause I really like getting\nmy total vitamin mineral\nbase covered in one\neasy to consume product.\nIt also tastes really good.\nI mix mine with a little\nbit of lemon juice.\nI've been doing that\nwell over a decade now.\nAnd the inclusion of probiotics\nis important to me because\nthere's a lot of data out there right now\nabout the importance of gut health\nfor the immune system for, mood.\nAnd so by combining all\nthese things in one product\nyou get all those things at once.\nIf you want to try Athletic Greens,\nyou can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman\nand that will give you a special offer\nwhere you will get a year supply\nof liquid vitamin D3 and K2\nvitamin D3 has been shown to be important\nfor various aspects of immune function\nas well as other biological functions.\nAnd so once more, if you\nwant to try athletic greens\nand get the year supply of vitamin D3 K2\njust go to athletigreens.com/huberman.\nThe other sponsor of today's\npodcast is InsideTracker.\nInsideTracker is a way to\nmeasure metabolic factors,\nhormones, and DNA related factors\nby way of blood tests and saliva\nin order to assess one's health.\nI'm a big believer in blood\ntests and saliva tests\nfor assessing one's health\nmarkers, because I like data.\nAnd there's really no other way to measure\nwhat's going on in one's body\nwithout taking the occasional\nblood test or saliva test.\nYou can guess what's going on\nbut if you really want to know\nwhat's going on under the hood\nInsideTracker can be of great help.\nOne of the problems with a\nlot of products out there\nor just regular blood testing\nis that you get a lot of\ndata back about the levels\nof various hormones,\nmetabolic factors, et cetera,\nbut you don't know what\nto do with those data.\nGreat thing about InsideTracker\nis provided in a format.\nThey have an online dashboard\nthat given your particular\nlevels of various things\ndirects you\ntoward potential lifestyle related changes\nlike changes in exercise, or\nchanges in sleep patterns,\nor changes in nutritional patterns,\nthat can really help move\nthose markers and those numbers\non those metabolic factors,\nhormones, et cetera\nin the direction that you want.\nIf you'd like to try InsideTracker\nyou can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.\nAnd if you do that,\nyou'll 25% off their program at checkout.\nOkay, let's get started.\nToday is episode three of the podcast\nand it is office hours.\nOffice hours as many of you\nknow, it's where students\ncome to the office of the professor,\nsit down and ask questions,\nrequesting clarification about\nthings that were confusing,\nor to simply go down the\nroute of exploring a topic\nwith more depth and detail.\nI asked for your questions to be listed\nin the comment section of\nthe previous two episodes\nof the podcast on YouTube,\nas well as on Instagram.\nAnd I first of all just want to thank you\nfor the many questions,\nthey are excellent.\nWe read them all.\nWe distilled from that\nlarge batch of questions\nto two types of questions.\nQuestions that were asked very often\nand were light very often with\na little thumbs up like tab\nas well as questions that we\nthought could really expand\non the topics that we've\ncovered previously.\nAnd today we're going\nto cover both of those.\nIf we did not get to your\nquestion, please don't despair.\nWe will keep track of those.\nAnd we have several more\nepisodes devoted to this topic\nof sleep and wakefulness and learning\nduring the month of January, maybe even,\nleaking over a little bit\ninto the month of February.\nSo, we have time that's\none of the unique formats\nof this podcast is that\nwe have time for dialogue,\nwe have time for your questions\nand we have time to really\ngo deep into these topics.\nIt's official Costello is\nsleeping in the background.\nSo if you hear snoring, Costello\nis going to be keeping time\nwith his deep and melodic snoring.\nThere he goes.\nSo the questions that we\nreceived, I batched crudely\ninto a couple of different categories,\nlight, exercise, supplementation,\ntemperature, learning,\nplasticity, and mood, and sort\nof mood related disorders.\nThere were a lot of questions about those.\nBefore we begin any of this\nI want to point out something that I,\nI always say it sounds like boiler plate\nbut it's important not just to protect me\nbut to protect you, which is\nthat I am not a physician.\nI'm not a medical doctor.\nI don't prescribe anything,\nincluding behavioral protocols.\nI'm a professor.\nSo I profess a lot of things\nbased on quality peer reviewed studies.\nYou should take that information.\nYou should filter it\nthrough whatever it is\nthat you currently happen\nto be dealing with,\nwhether or not that's health\nor illness, you should consult\nwith a licensed healthcare\nprofessional before you add\nor remove anything from\nyour daily life protocol.\nI'm not responsible for your health.\nYou are, so be smart with this information\nand be a stringent filter, as we say.\nOkay, very well let's get\nstarted on the actual material.\nSomebody asked, what is the\nrole of moonlight and fire,\nI'm presuming they mean fireplace\nor candle or things of that\nsort, in circadian rhythms.\nIs it okay to view moonlight at night\nor will that wake me up?\nWill a fire in my fireplace\nor using candle light\nbe too much light.\nGreat question, also\noffers me the opportunity\nto share with you\nwhat I think is a quite\nbeautiful definition\nof what light is in a quantitative sense.\nSo I've mentioned a few\ntimes the use of apps\nand light meters and things\nto measure things like locks,\nwhich sometimes are also\ndescribed in terms of Kendals.\nSo those are the two units\nfor measuring light intensity.\nTypically lux, L-U-X is the, is the unit.\nAnd so before we go forward\nand discuss this many lux\nor that many lux, I want to\njust tell you what a lux is\nbecause it relates to this question.\nOne lux equals the illumination\nof one square meter surface\nat one meter away from a single candle.\nThink about that.\nSo somebody actually decided at some point\nthat the amount of illumination\nat one square meter surface,\none meter away from a single\ncandle, that equals one lux.\nSo when we talk about 6,000\nlux of light intensity\nor 10,000 lux of light\nintensity, now you have a kind of\na reference or a framework that\nwould be the equivalent of,\nyou could think of it as 6,000 candles\nall with their light intensity shown\non one square meter from\none meters distance away.\nOr of course, if it was\na different number of lux\nit would be a different number of candles.\nSo you get the idea.\nHere's the great thing.\nIt turns out that moonlight, candle light,\nand even a fireplace, if you\nhave one of these roaring fires\ngoing in the fireplace,\ndo not reset your circadian clock at night\nand trick your brain into\nthinking that it's morning\neven though if you've ever\nsat close to a fireplace\nor even a candle, that\nlight seems very bright.\nAnd there are two reasons for\nthat that are very important.\nThe first one is that\nthese neurons in your eye\nthat I discussed in the previous episode\nthese melanopsin ganglion cells\nalso called intrinsically\nphotosensitive ganglion cells.\nThose cells adjust their\nsensitivity across the day,\nand those cells respond best\nto the blue-yellow contrast\npresent in the rising and setting sun,\nso-called low solar angle sun,\nalso discussed in the previous episode,\nbut those cells adjust\ntheir sensitivity such that\nthey will not activate\nthe triggers in the brain\nthat conveyed daytime signals\nwhen they view moonlight,\neven a full moon a really\nbright moon or fire.\nNow this does raise an\ninteresting kind of thought point,\nwhich is, you know, a lot of people talked\nabout lunacy and the fact that\nwhen there's a full moon out\npeople act differently\nand behave differently.\nThere's a lot of lore around that.\nThere's actually a little bit\nof quality science around that\nthat maybe we can address in the future.\nBut, moonlight is typically\nnot going to wake us up\ntoo much, except maybe\nthe moon is really full\nand really bright, there's\npossibility for that.\nSo, providing you're not going\nto burn down the structure\nyou're in, you're not going\nto burn down the forest,\nenjoy your, your fireplaces,\nenjoy your lights from candles.\nAnd those are perfectly safe\nwithout disrupting your circadian rhythm.\nBecause we talked about\njust how crucial it is\nto avoid bright lights\nbetween the hours of about\n10:00 PM and 4:00 AM.\nExcept when you need to view\nthings for sake of safety\nor work or so and so forth.\nI also received a lot of\nquestions about red light.\nNow, I think I was asked those questions\nbecause red light is used\nin a number of different\ncommercial products\nwhere these products\ntend to include a sheet,\nof very bright red lights.\nThat one is supposed to\nview early in the day.\nAnd there are various claims attached\nto these red light devices\nthat they improve mitochondrial function,\nthat they improve metabolism there-\nI'm going to be really honest\nand I can't name brands,\nand I'm not going to\nname particular studies.\n'Cause what I'm about to say\nabout these studies is\nnot particularly unkind\nbut let's just say that none\nof the studies that I've seen\nexcept for one that I'll\ntalk about in a moment,\npointing to the positive\neffects of red light\non the visual system are\npublished in blue ribbon journals.\nThey tend to be published in journals\nthat I had to work hard to find.\nI'm not sure what the peer\nreview and stringency level is.\nNow, that's not to say\nred light isn't beneficial\nbecause there is one study in particular\nthat came from Glen Jeffrey's Lab\nat the University of College, London\nit was published last year.\nGlen is somebody I happen to know\nis an excellent reputation,\nexcellent vision scientist,\nwhat this study essentially showed.\nAnd again, this is a study that\nI very much liked the data\nand think it was done\nwith very high standards.\nWhat this study shows is\nthat, viewing red light\nfor a few minutes each morning\ncan have positive effects on mitochondria\nin a particular retinal cell\ntype, that tends to degenerate\nor decline in function with age in humans.\nAnd that cell type is the photoreceptor.\nThe photoreceptor is a\ntype of cell in your eye\nthat sits at the back of the eye.\nIt's kind of some distance\naway from the ganglion cells.\nAnd it's the cell that\nconverts light information\ninto electrical signals that the rest\nof the retina and brain can understand.\nThese are vitally important\ncells without them,\npeople are blind.\nAnd many people's vision\ngets worse with age.\nIn particular, age related\nmacular degeneration\nbut also related to some other factors\nincluding photo receptor functionality\njust getting worse with time.\nAnd what Glen showed was\nthat red light flashes\ndelivered in particular early in the day\nbut not late in the day can\nhelp repair the mitochondria.\nNow this study needs more support\nfrom additional studies of course.\nThey are doing a clinical trial.\nThey did report on what I\nthink it was 12 patients.\nAnd so the work is ongoing,\nbut that was very interesting.\nAnd it points to some\npotentially really useful things\nabout red light.\nHowever, most of the questions I got\nabout red light for sake of office hours\nwere about the use of red\nlight later in the day.\nSo here's the deal, in principle red light\nwill not stimulate the\nmelanopsin retinal neurons\nthat wake up the brain and circadian clock\nand signal daytime.\nHowever, most of the red lights\nin particular the red lights\nthat come on these\nsheets of these products\nthat people are supposed\nto view them in order to\naccess a number of\nproclaimed health effects,\nthose are way too bright\nand would definitely wake\nup your body and brain.\nSo if you're going to use those products\nand I'm not suggesting\nyou do, or you don't,\nbut if that's your thing,\nyou would want to use those\nearly in the day.\nWho knows you might\neven derive some benefit\non mitochondria function\nin these photo receptors.\nBut if you're thinking about red light\nfor sake of avoiding the\nnegative effects of light\nlater in the day and at night,\nthen you want that red light\nto be very, very dim,\ncertainly much dimmer\nthan is on most of those\ncommercial products.\nNow, do you need red lights? No.\nAlthough red lights are rather convenient\nbecause you can see\npretty well with them on,\nbut if they're dim, they won't\nwake up the circadian clock.\nThey won't have this\ndopamine disrupting thing\nthat we talked about in\nthe previous podcast.\nSo there's a role for red light\npotentially early in the day\nand for mitochondrial repair\nin the photoreceptors,\nthere's a role for dim red light\nlater in the day and at night.\nSo you're starting to notice\na theme here which is that,\nthere's no immediate prescription\nof look at these light,\nit's look at these lights potentially\nif that's what you want to\ndo at particular times of day\nand we're particular intensities.\nIt brings us back to the blue light issue\nwhich is so many people are obsessed\nwith avoiding blue light, but you actually\nwant a ton of blue light early in the day\nand throughout the day.\nSo don't wear your blue blockers then\nor maybe even don't wear them at all.\nAnd at night, it doesn't matter\nif you have blue blockers on\nif the lights are bright\nenough, then you're still\ngoing to be activating\nthese cells and mechanisms.\nI just want to add something\nabout the science behind\nthe blue blocker confusion.\nSo these melanopsin retinal\ncells do react to blue light.\nThat that is the best stimulus\nfor one of these\nmelanopsin cells, which led\nto the belief that blue\nblockers would be a good thing\nfor preventing resetting of\nthe circadian clock at night\nand deleterious effects\nof screens, et cetera.\nHowever, the people\nthat made these products\nfail to actually read the\npapers from start to finish\nor if they did, they didn't\ncomprehend a critical element\nwhich is that most of\nthose papers early on\ntook those neurons out\nand put them in a dish.\nAnd when they did that,\nthey divorced those neurons\nfrom their natural connections in the eye.\nIt turns out in your IMI right now,\nbecause that's what we care\nabout, these cells exist\nand the cells respond to blue light\nbut also to other wavelengths of light\nbecause they not only\nrespond directly to light\nas they do in a dish, they also respond\nto input from photo receptors.\nSo if you talk to anyone in\nthe circadian biology field,\nthey'll tell you, \"Oh,\nyeah this blue light thing,\nhas really gotten out of control.\"\nBecause people assume that\nblue light is the culprit\nbecause blue light is the best stimulus.\nThat doesn't mean that blue\nlight is the only stimulus\nthat will trigger these cells, okay?\nSo like many things a\nscientific paper can be accurate\nwithout being exhaustive.\nAnd a lot of claims about\nproducts can be accurate,\nbut not exhaustive.\nSo blue light during the day is great.\nGet that screen light, get that sunlight\nespecially getting overhead lights.\nI'll talk about all this\nin the previous podcast,\nbut at night you really want\nto avoid those bright lights.\nAnd it doesn't matter if it's\nblue light or something else.\nAnd so there was a real confusion about\nthe papers and the data when most\nof those product\nrecommendations were made.\nOkay.\nWhile we're on that topic,\nlet's talk about light\nin other orifices of the body.\nI made a kind of a joke about\nthis, the last podcast episode\nbut a couple of people\nwrote to me and said,\nwell, I've seen some\nclaims that light delivered\nto the ears into the ears\nor the roof of the mouth\nor up the nose can be beneficial\nfor some setting circadian rhythms, no.\nNot directly anyway.\nAnd this is a great opportunity\nfor us to distinguish\nbetween what is commonly\ncalled the placebo effect\nbut a more important way to\nthink about any manipulation\nbehavioral or otherwise\nthat you might do is\nthe difference between\nmodulation and mediation.\nThere are a lot of things that\nwill modulate your biology.\nPutting a couple of lights up your nose,\nplease don't do this.\nMight modulate your biology by way\nof the stress hormone that's released\nwhen you stuffed those\nthings up your nose.\nRemember earlier a previous\npodcast, I said that\nvirtually anything we'll face\nshifts your circadian rhythm\nif it's different and dramatic enough.\nSo the question is, is\nit the light delivered\nup the nose or through the ears\nor some other orifice that's\nmediating the process?\nIs it actually tapping\ninto the natural biology\nof the system that you're\ntrying to manipulate?\nAnd this is where I like to distinguish\nbetween real biology and hacks.\nI don't like the word hack\nor frankly neuro hacking or bio hacking.\nI just don't like the\nterm because a hack is\nis using something for a purpose\nfor which it was not intended, right?\nBut where you can kind\nof, it's kind of a cheat\nand that's not how biology works well.\nSo I try and distinguish\nbetween things that really\nmediate biological processes\nand things that Modulate them.\nThere are a number of\ncommercial products out there\nwith some studies attached to them,\nclaiming that light delivered\nto the ears or wherever can\nadjust your wakefulness\nor adjust your sleep.\nI've looked at those papers again,\nI'm probably going to lose\nsome friends by saying this\nbut maybe I'll gain a few as well.\nNot blue ribbon journals, frankly,\noftentimes read the small print.\nThere was a conflict of\ninterest clause there\nrelated to commercial interests.\nIf somebody disagrees\nwith me outright on this\nand can send to me a peer reviewed paper,\npublished in a quality journal\nabout light delivered anywhere,\nbut the eyes of humans\nthat can mediate circadian,\nrhythms, wakefulness et cetera,\nI'm more than happy to take a look at that\nand change my words and stance on this\nand do it publicly, of course.\nBut until then I'm guessing that\nthe proper controls were not done\nof adjusting for heat\nthat could be delivered\nwhich can definitely\nshift circadian rhythms.\nWe're going to talk about temperature\nand other things like that.\nSo light to the eyes folks is\nwhere these light effects work\nin humans, in other animals,\nthey have extra ocular photo\nreception in humans, no.\nAnd just be mindful, I mean,\nI'm not trying to encourage people\nto avoid certain products in particular\nbut just be mindful of this difference\nbetween modulation and mediation.\nA mediating, a process\nthrough a hard wired\nor long-standing biological\nmechanism is really\nwhere you're going to see the\npowerful effects over time.\nI also, as you've probably noticed,\nI really tend to favor behavioral tools\nand zero cost tools first,\nand getting those dialed\nin before you start,\nplugging in and swallowing\nand putting things\nin various places just\nto really figure out\nhow your biology works and explore that,\nunless there's of course a clinical need\nto take a prescribed drug in which case,\nby all means, listen to your doctor.\nOkay, a huge number of\npeople asked me about\nwhat about light through windows?\nAnd I actually did an\nInstagram post about this look,\nsetting your circadian clock with sunlight\ncoming through a window\nis going to take 50\nto 100 times longer.\nIf you want the date on that,\nI'd be happy to send you\nto the various papers that were described\nin the previous podcast that\nJamie Zeitzer from Stanford.\nAnd I have discussed also elsewhere\nbut here's really the key thing with us.\nDo the experiment.\nYou can download the free app Light Meter.\nYou can have a bright day outside\nor some sunlight hold up\nthat app, take a picture.\nIt'll tell you how many lux\nnow, you know what lux are.\nIt will tell you how many\nlux are in that environment.\nNow close the window.\nAnd if you want close the\nscreen or don't open the screen\nyou can do all sorts of experiments.\nYou'll see that it will at\nleast half the amount of lux.\nAnd it doesn't scale linearly.\nMeaning let's say I get\na 10,000 lux outside,\n5,000 looking out through an open window\nand then I closed the\nwindow and it's 2,500 lux.\nIt does not mean that you just\nneed to view that sunlight\nfor twice as long if it's\nhalf as many lux, okay?\nIt's not like 2,500 lux\nmeans you need to look\nfor 10 minutes\nand 5,000 lux means you\nlook for five minutes.\nIt doesn't scale that way\njust because the biology\ndoesn't work that way.\nBest thing to do is to\nget outside, if you can,\nif you can't next best thing to do\nis to keep that window open.\nIt is perfectly fine to\nwear prescription lenses\nand contacts.\nWhy is it okay to wear\nprescription lenses and contacts,\nwhen those are glass also,\nbut looking through a window,\ndiminishes the effect.\nWell, we should think about this.\nThe lenses that you wear\nin front of your eyes\nby prescription or on your eyes\nare designed to focus the\nlight on to your neural retina.\nIn fact, that's what near-sightedness\nis, is when the image\nbecause your lens\ndoesn't work quite right.\nThe image falls in front\nof the neural retina,\nwearing a particular lens in front of that\nfocuses the lens onto your\nretina onto these very neurons.\nSo they can communicate that to the brain.\nIt's Costello is loving this light.\nHe's deep in sleep.\nAnd if we, maybe we\ncould play him some tones\nand he'll remember it\nlater, based on the studies,\nwe're going to talk about in a little bit.\nI don't know how we'd know\nif he remembered it or not,\nbut prescription lenses are fine.\nIn fact, they're great for this reason\nthey're actually focusing\nthe light onto the retina.\nSo think about this logically\nand all of a sudden it makes\nperfect sense your glass window\nor your windshield or the\nside window of your car,\nit isn't optically\nperfect to bring the image\nand the light onto your retina.\nIn fact, what it's\ndoing is it's scattering\nand filtering light in particular\nthe wavelengths of light that you want.\nSo, if you live in a low light environment\nlots of questions about this.\nWe talked about this, the previous podcast\nbut just get outside for longer or,\nand/or use really bright lights inside.\nOkay, so let's think about\nwhy I'm making some of\nthese recommendations\nbecause I think it can really empower you\nwith the ability to change your behavior\nin terms of light\nviewing and other things,\ndepending on time of year,\ndepending on other lifestyle factors.\nThe important point to understand\nis that early in the day,\nyour central circadian clocks\nand all these mechanisms are\nlooking for a lot of light.\nI mean, they don't have\na mind of their own,\nbut it needs a lot of light to\ntrigger this daytime signal,\nalertness et cetera.\nAnd early in the day, but\nnot in the middle of the day,\nyou can sum or add photons.\nSo there's this brief period\nof time early in the day,\nwhen the sun is low in the sky\nwhen your brain and body are expecting\na morning wake up signal\nwhere let's say, it's\nnot that bright outside.\nSomeone sent me a picture or\na little movie of their walk\nin England, and it was pretty overcast\nand they were using\nlight meter and they said\nit's only about 700\nlux or maybe even less.\nAnd I said, well, stay outside longer.\nBut when you get inside, turn\non the lights really bright\nand overhead lights in particular,\nbecause those will be best for\nstimulating these mechanisms.\nAnd that's because at least\nfor the first few hours of the day,\nyou can continue to some\nor add photon activation\nof the cells in the eye and the brain.\nIn the middle of the day, once\nthe sun is overhead, or even\nif you stay inside all morning,\nand then you're in the\ncircadian dead zone,\nwhich sounds terrible and it is terrible.\nYou doesn't matter if you\nget a ton of artificial light\nor even sunlight,\nyou're not going to shift\nyour circadian clock.\nYou're not going to get\nthat wake up signal.\nAnd then in the evening,\nyou want to think about\nthis whole system as being vulnerable\nto even a few photons of light\nbecause of their sensitivity\nto light really goes up at night.\nAnd I talked last time\nabout how you can protect\nagainst that sensitivity by\nlooking at the setting sun\nand watching the evening sun,\neven if it's not crossing the horizon\naround the time of sunset.\nAnd that's because it adjusts\nyour retinal sensitivity\nand your melatonin pathway\nso that light is not as\ndetrimental to melatonin at night.\nThink about the afternoon\nsunlight viewing as kind of a,\nI think of it as kind of\na Netflix inoculation.\nIt allows me to watch a little bit\nof Netflix in the evening,\nalthough it's very\nhard to watch a little bit\nof anything on Netflix.\nIt seems like there's some\nother neuro-biological process\nthat going on there where I have to watch\nepisode after episode after episode.\nBut in any case, you can protect yourself\nagainst some of that bad\neffect of light at night\nby looking at light in the evening.\nIt really does adjust down\nthe sensitivity of the system.\nOkay.\nI want to talk about seasonal changes\nin all these things as they\nrelate to mood and metabolism.\nSo depending on where\nyou are in the world,\nNorthern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere\nat the equator or closer to the poles,\nthe days and nights are going\nto be different lengths.\nThat just makes sense.\nBut that translates to\nreal biological signals\nthat impact everything from\nwakefulness and sleep times\nbut also mood and metabolism.\nSo here's how this works.\nNow, after seeing the previous\nepisode of the podcast\nand paying attention here, you are armed\nwith the knowledge to\nreally understand how it is\nthat believe it or not, every\ncell in your body is tuned\nto the movement of the\nplanet relative to the sun.\nSo as all of you know,\nthe earth spins once every\n24 hours on its axis.\nSo part of that day\nwere bathed in sunlight\ndepending on where we are\nthe other half of the day\nor part of the day we're in darkness.\nThe earth also travels\naround the sun 365 days\nis the time that it takes, one year,\nto travel around that sun.\nThe earth is tilted.\nIt's not perfectly upright.\nSo the earth is tilted on its axis.\nSo depending on where we\nare in that 365 day journey\nand depending on where we\nare in terms of hemisphere,\nNorthern hemisphere, Southern hemisphere,\nsome days of the year\nare longer than others.\nSome are very short, some are very long.\nIf you're at the, at the equator\nyou experience less variation\nin day length and therefore nightlife.\nAnd if you're closer to the poles,\nyou're going to experience\nsome very long days.\nAnd you're also going to\nexperience some very short days\ndepending on which poll you're at\nand what time of year it is.\nThe simple way to put this\nas depending on time of year\nthe days are either getting\nshorter or getting longer.\nNow, every cell in your\nbody adjusts its biology\naccording to day length, except\nyour brain, body and cells\ndon't actually know\nanything about day length.\nIt only knows night length.\nAnd here's how it works.\nLight inhibits melatonin powerfully.\nIf days are long and getting longer,\nthat means melatonin is reduced.\nThe total amount of melatonin is less\nbecause light is more,\ntherefore melatonin is less.\nIf days are getting shorter,\nlight can't inhibit melatonin as much,\nthrough the summing of photon mechanisms\nthat we talked about before,\nand that melatonin\nsignal is getting longer.\nSo every cell in your body actually knows\nexternal day length and\ntherefore time of year\nby way of the duration\nof the melatonin signal.\nAnd in general, it's fair to\nsay that in diurnal animals,\nmeaning animals like us\nthat tend to be awake\nduring the daytime and\nnot nocturnal animals,\nwhich tend to be awake at night.\nThe longer the melatonin\nsignal, the more depressed\nnot necessarily clinically depressed,\nalthough that can happen\nbut the more depressed\nour systems tend to be.\nReproduction, metabolism, mood,\nturnover rates of skin cells\nand hair cells all tend to be diminished\ncompared to the spring and summer months\nfor some Northern hemisphere,\nspring and summer months,\nor the times in which days are very long.\nAnd there's less melatonin that tends to,\nin almost all animals,\nincluding humans, more breeding,\nmore hormone elevation of the hormones\nthat stimulate breeding reproduction\nand fertility metabolism\nis up, lipid metabolism\nfat-burning is up,\nprotein synthesis is up.\nThese things tend to\ncorrelate with the seasons.\nNow, some people are very, very\nstrongly tied to the seasons.\nThey get depressed,\nclinically depressed in winter\nand light therapies are very\nuseful for those people.\nSome people love the winter\nand they're happiest in winter\nand they feel kind of depressed in summer.\nAlthough that is far more rare.\nThat doesn't mean depression\ncannot exist in the summer,\nbut when we're talking\nabout seasonal depression\nthat tends to be true.\nIt's more depression in winter.\nNow there's other things that\ncorrelate with seasonality.\nSuicide rates tend to\nbe highest in the spring\nnot in the winter,\nbut that has to do with some of the more\ncomplicated and unfortunately\ntragic aspects of suicide\nwhich is that oftentimes\npeople will commit suicide\nnot at the very depths\nof their energy levels,\nbut as they're emerging from\nthose depths of low energy.\nSo we'll talk about\nsuicidality and mood disorders\nin a later podcast season,\nmeaning a month later.\nBut for now, just understand that\neverybody is going through\nthese natural fluctuations\ndepending on the duration\nof the melatonin signal.\nNow this might lead you to say, \"Well,\nthen I should just really\nget as much light as I can\nall the time and reduce melatonin\nfeel great all the time.\"\nUnfortunately, doesn't work that way\nbecause melatonin also\nhas important effects\non the immune system.\nIt has important effects\non transmitter systems\nin the brain, et cetera.\nSo everybody needs to\nfigure out for themselves\nhow much light they need early in the day\nand how much light they need to avoid\nlate in the day,\nin order to optimize\ntheir mood and metabolism.\nThere is no one size fits all prescription\nbecause there's a range\nof melatonin receptors,\nthere are a range of\neverything from metabolic types\nto genetic histories,\nfamily histories, et cetera.\nThere is no one size fits all prescription\nbut by understanding that\nlight and extended day length\ninhibit melatonin and melatonin tends\nto be associated with a more depressed\nor reduced functioning of\nthese kinds of activity driving\nand mood elevating signals,\nand understanding that\nyou have some control\nover melatonin by way of\nlight, including sunlight\nbut also artificial light,\nand that should empower you\nI believe, to make the adjustments\nthat if you're feeling low you might ask,\nhow much light am I getting?\nWhat am I getting that light?\nBecause sleep is also important\nfor restoring mood, right?\nSo you need sleep.\nYou can't just, just crush\nmelatonin across the board\nand expect to feel good because\nthen you're not going to\nfall asleep and stay asleep.\nMelatonin, not incidentally comes from,\nis synthesized from serotonin.\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter\nthat is associated\nwith feelings of well-being\nprovided to proper levels,\nbut well-being of a particular kind.\nWell-being associated\nwith quiescence and calm\nand the feeling that we\nhave enough resources\nin our immediate kind of conditions.\nIs the kind of thing that\ncomes from a good meal\nor sitting down with friends\nor holding a loved one,\nor conversing with somebody\nthat you really bond with.\nSerotonin does not stimulate action.\nIt tends to stimulate stillness.\nVery different than the\nneuromodulator dopamine\nwhich is a reward feel good neuromodulator\nthat stimulates action.\nAnd actually dopamine is the cursor\nto epinephrin, to adrenaline\nwhich actually puts us into action.\nThere it's actually made\nfrom dopamine, right?\nSo, you can start to think how about light\nas a signal that is very powerful\nfor modulating things\nlike sleep and wakefulness\nbut also serotonin\nlevels, melatonin levels.\nAnd I talked about this previously\nbut I'll mention once more,\nthat light in the middle of the night\nreduces dopamine levels to the point where\nit can start causing problems\nwith learning and memory and mood.\nThat's one powerful reason\nto void bright light\nin the middle of the night.\nOkay.\nSeasonal rhythms have a number of effects\nbut humans are not\npurely seasonal breeders.\nUnlike a lot of animals,\nwe breed all year long.\nIn fact, there's a preponderance\nof September babies\nin my life, not actual babies,\nbecause they're born in September\nwhich means that they were\nconceived in December,\nwithout knowing the details\nwe can fairly assume that.\nAnd December, at least in\nthe Northern hemisphere\nat days tend to be shorter\nand nights tend to be longer.\nSo clearly humans aren't seasonal breeders\nbut there are shifts in\nbreeding and fertility\nthat exist in humans,\nbut also much more\nstrongly in other animals.\nSo seasonal effects vary.\nSome of you will experience\nvery strong seasonal effects\nothers of you will not.\nI think everybody should be taking care to\nget adequate sunlight and to\navoid bright light at night\nthroughout the year if possible.\nThroughout this podcast\nand in previous episodes,\nI've been mentioning neuromodulators,\nthings like serotonin and dopamine\nwhich tend to buy a certain brain circuits\nand things in our body to\nhappen in certain brain circuits\nand things in our body not to happen.\nOne of the ones I've mentioned\nnumerous times is epinephrin\nwhich is a neuromodulator that\ntends to put us into action,\nmake us want to move.\nIn fact, when it's released\nin high amounts in our brain\nand body, it can lead\nto what we call stress\nor the feeling of being stressed.\nSeveral people ask me,\nwhat's the difference\nbetween epinephrin and adrenaline.\nAdrenaline is secreted\nfrom the adrenal glands\nwhich sit right above our kidneys.\nEpinephrin is the exact same molecule\nexcept that it's released\nwithin the brain.\nAnd so people use these\nphrases or these words\nrather interchangeably, epi means near\nor on top of sometimes and neph, neph\nAnytime you see nephron\nor ph it means kidney.\nSo it means near the kidney.\nSo epinephrin actually\nmeans near the kidney.\nSo it was used originally\nto describe adrenaline,\nbut epinephrin and adrenaline\nare basically the same thing\nand they tend to stimulate\nagitation and the desire to move.\nThat's what that's about.\nWhich brings us to the topic of exercise.\nGot a lot of questions about exercise.\nWhat forms of exercise are\nbest for sleeping well?\nWhen should I exercise et cetera.\nThere's a lot of them individual\nvariability around this,\nbut I can talk about what I\nknow from the science literature\nand what I happened to do myself.\nThere are basically two forms of exercise\nthat we can talk about although, of course\nI realize there are many\ndifferent forms of exercise.\nThere's much more nuance to this,\nbut we can talk about\ncardiovascular exercise,\nwhere the idea is to repeat a movement\nover and over and over continuously.\nSo that'd be like running, biking, rowing\nand cycling this kind of thing.\nOr there's a resistance\nexercise where you're moving,\nlifting, presumably putting down also\nthings of progressively\nheavier and heavier weight\nthat you couldn't do\ncontinuously for 30 minutes.\nSo cardiovascular exercise is typically\nthe more aerobic type exercise\nand resistance exercise\nof course is the more\nanaerobic type exercise.\nAnd yes, there's\nvariation between the two.\nMost studies of exercise have\nlooked at aerobic exercise\nbecause that's basically the\nthing that you can get a rat\nor a mouse to do.\nYou know what's really\nweird about rats and mice,\nthey like to run on wheels so much,\nthat someone actually did this study,\nit was published in\nscience they put a wheel,\na running wheel in the middle of a field\nand mice ran to that wheel\nand ran on the wheel.\nThey turns out that what\nthey like is the passage\nof the visual image of the\nbars in front of their face,\nwhich I find kind of remarkable\nand troubling because it\nseems so like trivial,\nbut anyway they love aerobic exercise.\nAnd so most of the studies\nwere done on these mice\nthat love running on wheels.\nWhereas so far as it's\nbeen challenging to find\nconditions in which mice\nreally liked to lift weights\nor we'll do it in a laboratory.\nSo any weight bearing exercise studies\nreally have to be done in humans.\nAnd since humans are\nwhat we're interested in,\nthere are some studies\nlooking at these two things\nand when they tend to work best.\nNow you will see some\nplaces aerobic exercise\nis best done in the morning\nand weight training is\nbest done in the afternoon.\nI think there's far more\nindividual variation than that.\nI think there are however,\na couple of windows\nthat the exercise science literature\nand the circadian literature points to as\nwindows related to body temperature\nin which performance, injury,\nin which performance is optimized\ninjury is reduced and so on.\nAnd those tend to be 30\nminutes after waking.\nAnd that probably correlates\nwith the inflection in cortisol\nassociated with waking whether or not\nyou've gotten light or not,\nthree hours after waking,\nwhich probably correlates to\nthe rise in body temperature\nsometime right around waking.\nAnd the later afternoon,\nusually 11 hours after waking\nwhich is when temperature tends to peak.\nSo some people like to\nexercise in the morning.\nSome people like to\nexercise in the afternoon.\nIt really depends.\nI think for those of us\nwith very busy schedules,\nit's advantageous to be\nable to do your training\nwhenever you have the\nopportunity to do it,\nunless you can really\ncontrol your schedule.\nAnd so I would never want\nthese recommendations\nto seem like recommendations,\nwhat I'm really describing\nare some opportunities,\n30 minutes after waking,\nthree hours after waking\nor 11 hours after waking\nhas been shown at least in some studies\nto optimize performance, reduce injury\nand that sort of thing.\nBut you really have to figure\nout what works for you.\nA note about working out\nfirst thing in the morning.\nLast time we talked about\nnon-photo phase shifts.\nIf you exercise first\nthing in the morning,\nyour body will start to develop\nan anticipatory circuit.\nThere's actually plasticity\nin these circadian circuits\nthat will lead you to want to wake up\nat the particular time that you exercised\nthe previous three or four days.\nSo that can be a powerful tool\nbut you still want to get light exposure.\nBecause it turns out that\nlight and exercise converged,\nso giving even bigger, wake up\nsignal to the brain and body.\nSo you might want to think about that.\nSome people find if they\nexercise late in the day\nthey have trouble sleeping\nin general intense exercise does that,\nwhereas the kind of lower\nintensity exercise doesn't.\nI found some interesting literature\nthat talked about sleep need and exercise.\nI found this fascinating that\nif one is waking not feeling\nrested and recovered from\nand yet sleeping the same\namount that they typically have,\nit's quite possible that\nthe intensity of exercise\nin the proceeding two or\nthree days is too high.\nWhereas if one can't recover\nno matter how much sleep they get,\nthey're just sleepy all the time,\nI realized these things are correlated\nthat the volume of\ntraining might be too high.\nNow I'm not an exercise scientist.\nWe should probably get Andy\nGalpin or somebody else on here,\nwho's really an expert\nin this kind of stuff.\nI do realize as soon as\nanyone talks about exercise\nor nutrition publicly,\nthey're basically opening themselves up\nto all sorts of challenges\nbecause you can basically find support\nfor almost any protocol in the literature.\nWhat I've looked at was\ntwo journals in particular,\nInternational Journal Chronobiology\nand journal Biological Rhythms.\nExcuse me, to assess these parameters\nthat I I've mentioned\njust just a moment ago\nbecause the studies tended\nto be done in humans.\nThey were fairly recent and they came from\ngroups that I recognized as well as\nknowing that those\njournals are peer reviewed.\nMany of your questions were\nabout neural plasticity\nwhich is the brain and nervous\nsystem's ability to change\nin response to experience.\nThere was a question\nthat asked whether or not\nthese really deep biological\nmechanisms around wakefulness,\ntime of waking sleep, et cetera\nwere subject to neuroplasticity\nand indeed they are.\nSome of that plasticity is short-term\nand some of it is more long-term.\nThere's a really good\nanalogy here which is,\nif you happen to eat on\na very tight schedule\nwhere every day say it\n8:00 AM, noon and 7:00 PM\nis when you eat your food\nnot suggesting you do this\nbut let's say you were to do\nthat for a couple of days.\nAfter a few days,\nyou would start to\nanticipate those meal times\nwhere no matter where\nyou were in the world,\nno matter what was going on in your life\nabout five to 10 minutes\nbefore those meal times,\nyou would start to feel hungry\nand even a little agitated,\nwhich is your body's way\nof trying to get you to forage for food.\nAnd that's because of some peptide signals\nthat come from the\nperiphery from your body,\nthings like hypocretin norexin\nthat signal to the hypothalamus\nand brainstem to make you active\nand alert and look for\nfood and feel hungry.\nSo there's kind of an\nanticipatory circuit,\nthat's a chemical circuit,\nbut eventually over time,\nthe neurons, the neural circuits\nthat control hypocretin orexin\nwould get tuned to the neural circuits\nthat are involved in eating\nand maybe even smell and taste\nto create a kind of eating circuit\nthat's unique to your\npattern, to your rhythms.\nThe same thing is true for\nthese waking and exercise\nand other schedules, including\nall trade-in schedules.\nIf you wake up in the morning\nand start getting your\nsunlight, you start exercising\nin the morning or you\nexercise in the afternoon,\npretty soon, your body will\nstart to anticipate that\nand start to secrete\nhormones and other signals\nthat prepare your body\nfor the ensuing activity\nof waking up or going to sleep.\nSo if you get onto a pattern or a rhythm,\neven if that rhythm\nisn't down to the minute,\nyou'll find that there's\nplasticity in these circuits\nand it becomes easier to wake up early.\nIf that's your thing or\nexercise at a particular day\nif that's your thing.\nThat's the beauty of neuroplasticity.\nA number of people ask,\n\"What can I do to increase plasticity?\"\nAnd that really comes in two forms.\nThere's plasticity that\nwe can access in sleep\nto improve rates of learning\nand depth of learning\nfrom the previous day or so.\nAnd there's this an SDR\nnon-sleep deep breaths\nthat can be done without\nsleeping, to improve rates\nof learning and depth\nof retention, et cetera.\nSo let's consider those both\nand you can incorporate\nthese protocols if you like.\nAgain, these are based on\nquality peer reviewed studies.\nFirst, let's talk about learning in sleep.\nThis is based on some work that\nI'll provide the reference for\nthat was published in the journal Science.\nExcellent journal, Matt\nWalker also talks about some\nof these studies done by others\nin his book \"Why We Sleep\".\nThe studies just to remind you are\nstructured in he following\nway an individual\nis brought into a laboratory, Lowe does a\nspatial memory task.\nSo there tends to be a screen\nwith a bunch of different\nobjects popping up on the screen\nin different locations.\nSo it might be a Bulldog's\nface that might be a cat,\nand it might be an Apple\nthan it might be a pen\nin different locations.\nAnd that sounds trivial easy\nbut with time you can\nimagine it gets pretty tough\nto come back a day later and remember,\nif something presented in a given location\nwas something you've seen\nbefore and whether or not\nit was presented in that\nlocation or a different location.\nIf you had enough objects\nand changed locations enough,\nthis can actually be quite difficult.\nIn this study, the subjects either just\nwent through the experiment\nor a particular odor\nwas released into the room\nwhile they were learning\nor a tone was played in the\nroom while they were learning.\nAnd then during the\nsleep of those subjects\nthe following night and\nthe following night,\nso this was done repeatedly\nfor several nights,\nthe same odor or tone was played\nwhile the subjects were sleeping.\nThey did this in different stages of sleep\nnon-REM sleep and rapid eye\nmovement, sleep REM sleep.\nThey did this with just the tone in sleep.\nIf the subjects had the\nodor but not the tone,\nthey did it with putting the tone,\nif they had had the odor while learning.\nSo basically all the controls,\nall the things you'd want\nto see done to make sure\nthat it wasn't some indirect\neffects, a modulatory effect.\nOkay.\nAnd what they found was that\nproviding the same stimulus,\nthe odor, if they\nsmelled an odor or a tone\nif the subjects heard\na tone while learning\nif they just delivered that odor or tone\nwhile the subject slept, rates of learning\nand retention of information\nwas significantly greater.\nThis is pretty cool.\nWhat this means that you can\ncue the subconscious brain,\nand the asleep brain to\nlearn particular things\nbetter and faster.\nSo how might you implement this?\nWell, you could play\nwith this if you want.\nI don't see any real challenge\nto this provided the\nodor and is a safe one\nand then doesn't wake you up\nand the tone is a safe one,\nand doesn't wake you up.\nYou could do this by having\na metronome, for instance,\nwhile I'm learning something,\nplaying in the background\nor particular music\nand then have that very\nfaintly while you sleep.\nSo you could apply this\nif you like and try this.\nThere are a number of groups I think now\nthat are trying this\nusing tactile stimulation.\nSo slight vibration on\nthe wrist during learning\nand then the same vibration\non the wrist during sleep.\nIt does not appear that\nthe sensory modality,\nwhether or not it's odor or auditory tone\nor tactile stimulation,\nsome as a sensory stimulation,\nwhether or not it matters.\nIt's remarkable because it really shows\nthat sleep is an extension\nof the waking state.\nWe've known that for a long time\nbut this really tethers those two\nin a very meaningful and actionable way.\nSo I think I'll report back to you\nas I learned more about these studies,\nbut that's what I know\nabout them at this point.\nAs long as we're there\nwe might as well talk about dreaming\n'cause I got so many\nquestions about dreams.\nA couple of you, we want to\nask me what their dreams meant.\nLook, I don't even know what\nmy dreams mean half the time.\nI occasionally will wake up\nfrom a dream and remember it.\nIf you want to remember\nyour dreams better,\nif you're somebody who has challenges\nremembering your dreams,\nyou can set your alarms\nthat you wake up in the middle of this\none of these 90 minute\ncycles which toward morning\ntend to be occupied almost\nexclusively by REM sleep.\nRemember early in the night,\nyou have less REM sleep\nthan later in the night.\nBut you want to get as\nmuch sleep as you can\n'cause that's healthy.\nSo I don't know that you\nwant to wake yourself up.\nSome people find that\nwriting down their thoughts immediately\nfirst thing in the morning\nallows them to relater\nspontaneously remember\ntheir dream they had.\nThere's some literature on that.\nThe meaning of dreams is a\nlittle bit controversial.\nSome people believe\nthey have strong meaning\nother people believe that they can be\njust spontaneous firing of\nneurons that were active\nin the waking state and\ndon't have any meaning.\nThere are good data to show\nthat when you learn spatial,\nnew spatial environments that\nthere's a replay of those\nenvironments, so-called place\ncells that fire in your brain\nonly when you enter a\nparticular environment,\nthat those are replayed in\nsleep in almost direct fashion\nto the way that things were activated\nwhen you were learning that spatial task.\nDreams are fascinating, they're\nwere paralyzed during dreams\nwhich brings us to another question.\nSomebody asked about sleep paralysis.\nWe are paralyzed for much of our sleep,\nso-called atonia so presumably\nso we don't act out our dreams.\nSome people wake up and\nthey're still paralyzed.\nI've actually had this happen to me\nnot very many times, but a few times.\nAnd then they jolt themselves awake\nand it actually is quite terrifying.\nI can say from personal\nexperience to wake up\nbe wide awake and you cannot\nmove your body at all.\nIt's really quite frightening.\nThere are a couple of\nthings that will increase\nthe intrusion of atonia\ninto the wakeful state\nwhich is essentially\nmeans you're waking up\nbut you can't, you can't move.\nOne is marijuana, THC, a\nI'm not a marijuana smoker.\nI'm not a copper.\nI don't know the legality where you live.\nSo I'm not saying one thing\nor another about marijuana.\nI'm just, the fact that\nI had that experience\nwithout marijuana means that\nit can happen regardless,\nbut marijuana smokers, for whatever reason\nmaybe it has something to do\nwith the cannabinoid receptors\nor the serotonin receptors\ndownstream of the motor pathways.\nI don't know.\nI couldn't find any literature on this\nbut marijuana smokers\nreport, higher frequency\nof this kind of paralysis and wakefulness\nas you transition from\nsleep to wakefulness.\nI suppose probably\none could learn to get\ncomfortable with it.\nFor me, it was terrifying, 'cause I'm just\nused to being able to\nmove my limbs fortunately\nand I wasn't able to,\nand it's a quite a thing,\nlet me tell you, okay.\nsome other questions\nabout neuroplasticity.\nSo the other form of neuroplasticity\nis not the neuroplasticity\nthat you're amplifying\nby listening to tones or\nsmelling odors in sleep,\nbut the neuroplasticity\nthat you can access\nwith non sleep deep rest.\nSo NSDR, non sleep deep rest\nas well as short 20 minute naps,\nwhich are very close\nto non sleep deep rest\nbecause people rarely drop\ninto deep States of\nsleep during short naps,\nunless they're very sleep deprived.\nNSDR has been shown to\nincrease rates of learning\nwhen done for 20 minute bouts for a proxy-\nto match an approximately\n90 minute about of learning.\nSo what am I talking about?\n90 minute cycles are\nthese ultradian cycles\nthat I've talked about previously.\nAnd we tend to learn very well\nby taking a 90 minute cycle\ntransitioning into some focus\nmode early in the cycle,\nand it's hard to focus and then deep focus\nand learning feels almost\nlike agitation and strain\nand then by the end of\nthat 90 minute cycle,\nit becomes very hard to maintain focus\nand learn more information.\nThere's a study published\nin Cell Reports last year.\nGreat journal, excellent\npaper showing that\n20 minute naps or light sleep\nof a sort of non sleep deep\nrest taken immediately after\nor close to it, doesn't have to be\nimmediately after you\nfinished the last sentence\nof learning or whatever\nit is, or bar of music.\nBut you know, a couple of\nminutes after transitioning\nto a period of non sleep deep rest,\nwhere you're turning off the\nanalysis of duration path\nand outcome has been shown\nto accelerate learning\nto a significant degree.\nBoth the amount of information\nand the retention of that information.\nSo that's pretty cool,\nbecause this is a\ncost-free, drug-free way of\naccelerating learning without\nhaving to get more sleep.\nBut simply by introducing\nthese 20 minute bouts.\nI would encourage people\nif they want to try this\nto consider the 20 minutes\nper every 90 minutes\nof ultradian learning cycle,\nthere you're incorporating\na number of different\nneuroscience backed tools\n90 minute cycles for focused learning.\nIt could be motor, it could be cognitive,\nit could be musical, whatever,\nand then transitioned\nto a 20 minute non sleep\ndeep rest protocol.\nI just want to cue you the\nfact that in last` episode\nin the caption on\nYouTube, we provided links\nto two different yoga nidra,\nnon sleep deep rest protocols\nas well as hypnosis protocols\nthat are clinically backed\nfrom my colleague David Spiegel\nat Stanford Psychiatry Department.\nAll those resources are free.\nThere are also a lot of other\nhypnosis scripts out there.\nI like the ones from Michael Sealey\nS-E-A-L, I think it's\nE-Y, maybe it's just L-Y,\nyou can find them easily on YouTube,\nclinical hypnosis scripts\nmeaning not stage hypnosis.\nThey're not designed to\nget you to do anything.\nIn fact they're just designed to\nhelp rewire your brain circuitry.\nNow, how does hypnosis work that way?\nThis has a lot to do with sleep because\nit engages neuro-plasticity\nby bringing together\ntwo things that normally are\nseparate from one another,\none is the alert focused wakeful state\nwhere you activate the learning.\nAnd then there's the deep\nrest where the actual\nreconfiguration of the neurons\nand synopsis takes place.\nHypnosis brings both the focus\nand the deep rest component\ninto the same compartment of time.\nIt's a very unique state in that way.\nSo hypnosis kind of\nmaximizes the learning about\nand the non sleep deep\nbreasts bow and combines them.\nBut of course that requires\nsome guidance from a script\nor from a hypnotist\nclinically, a trained hypnotist\nand it becomes hard to\nacquire detailed information.\nIt's more about shifts in state,\nlike fear to states of calm\nor smoking to quitting smoking,\nanxiety around a trauma\nto release of anxiety around a trauma\nrather than specific information\nlearned in hypnosis, okay?\nSo hypnosis seems more about\nmodulating the circuits\nthat underlie state as opposed\nto specific information.\nAlthough I would not be surprised\nif there weren't certain forms of hypnosis\nthat could increase retention and learning\nof specific information, but I'm not aware\nof any of those protocols out there yet.\nWhich brings us to the\nnext thing about learning\nand plasticity which is\nnootropics, AKA smart drugs.\n[sighs]\nThis is a big topic that sigh was\na sigh of concern about\nhow to address nootropics\nin a thorough enough, but\nthoughtful enough way.\nLook, I have a lot of\nthoughts about nootropics.\nFirst of all, it means\nsmart drugs, I believe.\nAnd I don't like that phrase because\nlet's just take a step back\nand think about exercise.\nYou just say, I want to\nbe more physically fit.\nWhat does that mean?\nDoes it mean I would ask for\nmore specificity, I'd say,\nDo you want to be stronger?\nOkay, maybe you need to lift\nheavier objects progressively.\nDo you want more endurance\nvery different protocol\nto access endurance.\nDo you want flexibility?\nDo you want explosiveness or suppleness?\nHuge range of things that\nwe call physical fitness.\nMaybe you want all of those.\nIf we were talking about emotional fitness\nwe would say, well,\ninability to feel empathy\nbut probably also to\ndisengage from empathy\nbecause you don't want to be tethered\nto other people's emotions all the time.\nThat's not healthy either.\nYou would think about being able\nto access a range of\nemotions, but for some people\ntheir range into the sadness\nregime is really quite vast\nbut their range into the happiness regime\nmight be kind of limited.\nFor other people who are in a manic state,\nit might be, they can\naccess all that happy stuff\nbut not the sadder stuff.\nSo I'm speaking by way of analogy here.\nBut if we say we're\ntalking about cognitive\nand cognitive abilities we have to ask,\nokay, creativity, memory.\nWe tend to associate\nintelligence with memory.\nAnd I think this goes\nback to like spelling bees\nor something, the ability to\nretain a lot of information\nand just regurgitate information\nwhich will get you some distance\nin some disciplines of life.\nBut it won't allow you creative thinking,\nit's necessary for creative thinking.\nYou need a knowledge base, right?\nYou can't just look up everything\non Google, despite what\nyou know, certain educators\nor so-called educators say,\nyou need a database so that\nyou can have the raw materials\nwith which to be creative.\nSo necessary to have memory\nbut not sufficient to be creative, right?\nThe creative could have a\npoor memory for certain things\nbut certainly not for everything.\nThey can't have anterograde\nand retrograde amnesia.\nThey'd be like the\ngoldfish that every time\naround the tank, it, you know\nI can't remember where it's at.\nI actually don't know that\nthey've ever done that experiment\nby the way, but you know,\nso no disrespect to goldfish\nbut you know, so you get the idea.\nYou've got creativity, you have memory,\nyou have the ability\nto task switch, right?\nYou have the ability to\nstrategy development, strategy implement.\nSo the problem I have with\nthe concept of a nootropic\nor a smart drug is it's not\nspecific as to what cognitive\nalgorithm you're trying to engage.\nWe need more specificity.\nThat said, there are elements to learning\nthat we've discussed here before\nthat are very concrete things like\nthe ability to focus and put the blinders\non to everything else that's happening in\naround you and in your head mainly, right?\nDistractions about things\nyou should be doing,\ncould be doing or might be doing\nand focus on what you need to do.\nAnd then that's required for\ntriggering the acetylcholine\nneuromodulator that will then allow you to\nhighlight the particular\nsynopsis that will then\nlater change in sleep.\nSo no nootropic allows\nyou to bypass the need\nfor sleep in deep rest.\nThat's important to understand.\nSo I daydream about a day\nwhen people will be able\nto access compounds that are safe,\nthat will allow them to\nlearn better meaning,\nto access information, focus better,\nas well as to sleep better\nand activate the plasticity\nfrom the learning about.\nRight now most nootropics\ntend to bundle a bunch of things together.\nMost of them include some\nform of stimulant, caffeine.\nEpisode two, I'll tell you more probably\nthan you ever wanted\nto know about caffeine,\nadenosine and how that works.\nSo refer there for how caffeine works.\nBut stimulants will allow\nyou to increase focus\nup to a particular point.\nIf you have too little\nalertness in your system,\nyou can't focus, too much however,\nyou start to cliff and focus drifts, okay?\nSo you can't just ingest more\nstimulant to be more focused.\nIt doesn't work that way.\nMost nootropics also\ninclude things that increase\nor a desire to increase acetylcholine.\nThings like alpha GPC and\nother things of that sort.\nAnd indeed, there's some evidence\nthat they can increase acetylcholine.\nI refer you again to\nexamine.com the website to\nevaluate any supplements or\ncompounds for their safety\nand their effects in humans\nand animals, free website\nas well as with links to studies.\nSo we need the focus component.\nWe need the alertness component.\nThe alertness component\ncomes from epinephrin,\ntraditionally from caffeine stimulation.\nThe acetylcholine stimulation\ntraditionally comes\nfrom Coleen donors or alpha\nGPC, things of that sort.\nAnd then you would want to\nhave some sort of off switch,\nbecause anything that's going to really\nstimulate your alertness,\nthat then provides a crash.\nThat crash is not a crash\ninto the deep kind of restful slumber\nthat you would want for learning,\nit's a crash into the kind of,\nlet's just call it lopsided\nsleep, meaning it's deep sleep\nbut it lacks certain\nspindles and other elements\nof the physiology sleep spindles,\nthat really engage the learning process\nand the reconfiguration of synopsis.\nSo right now, my stance\non nootropics is that\nmaybe, maybe for occasional\nuse, provided it's safe for you,\nI'm not recommending it, but in general\nit tends to use more of a shotgun approach\nthan is probably going to be useful\nfor learning and memory in the long run.\nA lot of people ask about\nModafinil or armodafinil\nwhich was designed for\ntreatment of narcolepsy.\nSo right there, it tells\nyou it's a stimulant.\nAnd yes, there is evidence, it\nwill improve learning memory.\nModafinil is very expensive.\nLast time I checked our Modafinil\nI think is the recent\nreleased a generic version\nof this that's far less expensive.\nMost of these things look\na lot like amphetamine\nand many of them have the\npotential for addiction\nor can be habit forming.\nBut more importantly,\na lot of those things\nalso can create metabolic\neffects by disruption\nto insulin receptors and so forth.\nSo you want to approach those with a\nstrong sense of caution.\nNow, there are the milder\nthings that act as nootropics\nthat I mentioned, some\nof them like alpha GPC.\nSome people like Gingko.\nGingko gives me vicious\nheadaches, so I don't take it.\nSo people really differ.\nLast podcast, I recommend\nmagnesium threonate\nif you were exploring supplements\nI'm not recommending anything directly.\nI'm just saying if you're\nexploring supplements,\nmagnesium threonate seems\namong the magnesiums\nto be one of the more\nbioavailable and useful for sleep.\nI recommended it actually\nto a good friend of mine,\nit gave him at very low dose,\nhe had stomach issues with it.\nHe just had to simply stop taking it.\nSo there's variability there.\nYou just, it gave him\nsome stomach cramping\nand just didn't feel good on it.\nStopped it, he felt better.\nOther people take magnesium\nthreonate and feel great.\nI was asked, do magnesium need to be taken\nwith or without food or before sleep?\nIf you're going to go that route\nit should be taken 30 to\n60 minutes before sleep,\n'cause it's designed to make you sleepy.\nAnd I'm not aware that it\nhas to be taken with food,\nbut again all of this has\nto be run by your doctor\nand this is your healthcare to govern not,\nthese are not strict\nrecommendations so look into it.\nBut magnesium threonate,\nmost people I recommend it to\nhave benefit from it tremendously.\nSome people can't tolerate\nit, so you have to find out.\nThere were a number of questions\nabout other supplements\ndesigned to access deep sleep,\nin part to access neuroplasticity,\nbut now I'm just sort of\ntransitioning from neuroplasticity\nto these compounds that\ncan regulate sleep.\nOne of them that I discussed\nat the end of the last podcast,\nI got a lot of questions about is apigenin\nA-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin.\nIf you will look in the literature\nthe way it works is it\nincreases some of the enzymes\nassociated with GABA metabolism.\nIt actually, GABA's an\ninhibitory neurotransmitter.\nIt's the neurotransmitter\nthat is increased\nafter a couple alcohol\ndrinks containing alcohol.\nAnd that shut down the forebrain.\nApigenin is a derivative of the camomile.\nI think that the proper pronunciation\nof this is metric caria kemo mila.\nAlthough I always feel like\nI should be using a Spanish accent.\nWhenever I say something like that\nother related things that\nimpact the GABA system\nand increase GABA or\nthings like passion flower\nwhich is [speaks in foreign language].\n[chuckles] I don't know why\nthe Italian, is that Italian.\nAnyway, my Italian\ncolleagues, please forgive me.\nI have some very close Italian friends\nand colleagues in Genoa.\nI butchered the Italian, sorry.\nIn any event apigenin and\npassion flower found in a lot of,\na lot of supplements designed\nto increase sleepiness\nand sleep because, and\nthey work presumably\nbecause they increase GABA.\nActually they work on chloride channels\nrather than give you a whole lecture\non membrane biophysics in neurons.\nI'll just say that when\nneurons are really active\nit's because sodium ions,\nsalt rushes into the cells\nand causes them to fire electrically.\nThe cells tend to become\nless active as more chloride\nwhich is a negatively charged ion.\nThis is probably taking\nsome of you back to the\neither the wonderful times\nor traumas of high school physics.\nThe chloride is negatively charged so,\nit tends to make cells\nless electrically positive,\n'cause carries a negative charge\nand hyperpolarizes the neuron.\nSo apigenin works through\nthese increasing the activity\nof these chloride channels.\nPassionflower works by\nincreasing the activity\nof these chloride channels\nand GABA transmission.\nIt tends to increase this\ninhibitory neurotransmitter\nthat shuts off our thinking\nour analysis of duration path and outcome.\nSo if you're going to explore these things\nI suggest you at least know how they work.\nYou at least go to examined.com\nthat you talked to your doctor about them.\nSome people asked about serotonin\nfor getting to sleep and staying asleep.\nNow I understand the rationale here.\nJust like I understand the\nrationale of taking something\nlike Macuna Purina or\nL-DOPA to increase dopamine\nbut sometimes what works on paper\ndoesn't really work in the real world.\nI personally have tried\ntaking a supplement\nwhich was Al tryptophan, which\nis the precursor to serotonin\nor five HTP, which is\ndesigned to increase,\nit is serotonin basically.\nYou're just a one biochemical step away\nfrom actually taking actual serotonin.\nAnd I'll be honest the sleep that I had\nwith increased serotonin\nby way of tryptophan or\nfive HTP was dreadful.\nI fell asleep almost immediately.\nYou say, well, that's great.\nAnd 90 minutes later, I woke up\nand I couldn't sleep almost for 48 hours.\nNow that was me, I have\na pretty sensitive system\nto certain things and not to other things.\nSome people love these things.\nSo you really have to be thoughtful\nand explore them with\nthat kind of awareness\nof being thoughtful and\nrealizing that what works for you\nmight not work for everybody\nand what works for everybody\nmight not work for you.\nOkay?\nI'd like to continue by talking about\nthe role of temperature\nin sleep, accessing sleep,\nstaying asleep and wakefulness.\nBut first I want to tell a joke.\nBecause I think this joke\nreally captures some of the\ncritical things to understand\nabout any self-experimentation\nthat you might do.\nSo this is a story that was told to me\nby a colleague of mine who's\nnow a professor of Caltech\nnot to be named.\nSo there's a scientist\nand they're in their lab.\nAnd they're trying to understand\nhow the nervous system works.\nSo they go over to a tank\nand they pick up a frog,\nand they take the frog and\nthey put it down on the table\nAnd they clap.\n[claps]\nAnd the frog jumps.\nSo they think for awhile,\nthey pick up the frog, okay.\nThey go over to the\ncabinet and they take out\na little bit of a paralytic\ndrug and they inject it locally\ninto the back leg, set\nit down and clap. [claps]\nAnd the frog jumps,\nbut it kind of like jumps\nto the side a little bit.\nThey pick it up, they inject the paralytic\ninto the other back leg.\nThey clap again, the frog jumps,\nbut it really doesn't jump well that time,\nit kind of drags itself forward.\nSo they pick it up and\nthey inject the paralytic\ninto the remaining two legs.\nThey set it down and they clap\nand the frog doesn't jump.\nAnd they go,\n\"Oh my goodness! The legs\nare used for hearing.\"\nNow they publish the paper.\nPaper comes out in a great\njournal, news releases.\nIt's a really big deal,\ntheir career takes off.\n20 years later, a really\nsmart graduate student\ncomes along and says, \"Yeah\nbut that's loss of function.\nIt doesn't really show gain of function.\"\nSo let's take a closer look.\nSo they repeat the first\nexperiment and checks out,\neverything happens the same\nway, but then they take the frog\nand they inject a drug into\nall four legs that turns off\nthe paralytic, right?\nIt's an antagonist.\nThey set the frog down, they\nclap, and the frog jumps\nand they go, \"Oh my goodness! It's true.\nThe legs really are for hearing.\"\nNow, first of all, I want\nto make the point that\nthis is not to illustrate that science\nis not a good practice, it is.\nWe need to do loss of function\nand gain and function experiments.\nBut just to show that\ncorrelation and causation\nis complicated.\nYou need to do a variety\nof control experiments,\nand you really need to figure\nout what works for you.\nAnd so while science can\nprovide answers about what works\nunder very controlled\nconditions, it doesn't\nand can never address all the situations\nin which a given compound,\na given practice will or won't work.\nAnd it's not just individual variability\nis that there are a number\nof different factors.\nYou all of course know\nthat light can activate\nand shift your circadian\nrhythm, but so can exercise,\nso can food.\nThe last point I want to\nmake is an important one,\nwhich is that no frogs were hurt\nin the telling of this joke.\nOkay. So let's continue.\nI want to talk about temperature.\nTemperature is super\ninteresting as it relates to\ncircadian rhythms and\nwakefulness and sleep.\nFirst let's take a look\nat what's happening to our\nbody temperature across\neach 24-hour cycle.\nIn general, our temperature\ntends to be lowest\nright around 4:00 AM and starts\ncreeping up around 6:00 AM,\n8:00 AM and peaks sometime\nbetween 4:00 PM and 6:00 PM.\nNow that varies from person\nto person, but in general\nif we were to continuously\nmonitor or occasionally monitor\ntemperature that's what we would see.\nNow what's interesting is\nthat even in the absence\nof any light cues or meal\ncues, we would have a shift.\nWe would have an oscillation\nor a rhythm in our temperature.\nThey would go from high to low.\nThis is why the idea that we're all 96.8\nand that's our correct temperature.\nForget that. That is no longer true.\nIt never was true.\nIt depends on what time of\nday you measure temperature.\nHowever, there is a range\nwhich is within normal range,\nI think most of us associate\nfever with somewhere around\n100, 101 103, that's concerning.\nAnd we will be very concerned\nif temperature drop too low as well.\nThe way that the temperature\nrhythm that's indogenous,\nthat's within us and\nrhythmic no matter what,\nthe way it gets anchored to\nthe pattern I described before,\nor being lowest at 4:00 AM\nand increasing again around,\nthrough the day until about\nfour to 6:00 PM is by way\nof entrainment or matching\nto some external cue,\nwhich is almost always going\nto be light, but also exercise.\nNow you may have experienced\nthis temperature rhythm\nand how quickly it can become uninterested\nor it can fall out of entrainment.\nHere's an experiment I\nwouldn't want you to do\nbut you've probably\nexperienced this before,\nwhere you wake up, it's sunny outside,\nand maybe you have some email\nor some things to take care of\nor maybe you didn't sleep\nthat well the night before\nand so you stay in doors.\nYou don't change anything\nabout your breakfast,\nyou don't change anything about\nyour within home temperature\nor anything like that.\nAnd somewhere right\naround 10 or 11 o'clock\nyou start feeling kind of\nchilled, like you're cold.\nWell, what happened was\nthe oscillators, the clocks\nin your various tissues that\nare governed by temperature\nand circadian rhythm are\nstarting to split away\nfrom your central clock mechanisms.\nSo it's actually important\nthat your temperature match day length.\nNow there's another way\nin which temperature matches,\noh daytime, excuse me.\nThere's also an important way\nin which temperature matches\nday length in general\nas days get longer, it\ntends to be hotter out.\nNot always, but in general,\nthat's the way it is.\nAnd as days get shorter, it\ntends to be colder outside.\nSo temperature and day length\nare also linked metabolically.\nThey're linked biologically\nthey're linked, excuse me,\nand atmospherically they're linked\nfor the reason that we talked about before\nabout duration of day length\nand other climate features and so forth.\nSo one of the most powerful things\nabout setting your\ncircadian rhythm properly\nis that your temperature\nwill start to fall\ninto a regular rhythm.\nAnd that temperature\nhas a very strong effect\non things like metabolism\nand when you will feel\nmost willing and interested\nin exercising, typically\nthe willingness to exercise\nand engage in any kind of\nactivity mental or physical\nis going to be when that rise\nin temperature is steepest.\nWhen the slope of that line is greatest.\nThat's why 30 minutes after waking\nis one of those key windows,\nas well as three hours after waking.\nAnd then when temperature actually peaks\nwhich is generally, generally\nabout 11 hours after waking.\nSo this is why we say that\ntemperature and circadian rhythm\nare linked but they're actually\neven more linked than that.\nWe've talked before about\nhow light enters the eye,\ntriggers activation of\nthese melanopsin cells,\nwhich then triggers activation\nof the super charismatic nucleus,\nthe master circadian clock.\nAnd then I always say the\nmaster circadian clock\ninforms all the cells\nand tissues of your body\nand puts them into a nice cohesive rhythm.\nBut what I've never answered\nwas how it actually puts them\ninto that rhythm.\nAnd it does it two ways.\nOne is it secretes a peptide.\nAnd peptide is just a\nlittle protein that floats\nthrough the bloodstream\nand signals to the cells.\nOkay, we're tuning your clock.\nKind of like a little,\nwe know watch store,\nthe watch store owner\nwould tune the clocks.\nBut the other way is it\nsynchronizes the temperature\nunder which those cells exist.\nSo temperature is actually the effector\nof the circadian rhythm.\nNow this is really important because\nchanges in temperature by way\nof exercise, by way of eating,\nbut especially by way of exercise\ncan start to shift our circadian\nrhythm pretty dramatically.\nBut let's even go to in\na more extreme example.\nNowadays, there's some\ninterest in cold showers\nand ice baths, not everybody\nis doing this I realize.\nPeople seem to either\nlove this or hate this.\nI don't mind the cold dunk thing.\nI get regular about this from\ntime to time and I'll do it.\nI haven't been doing it recently.\nIt's always painful to do\nthe first couple of times\nthen you get kind of used to it.\nHowever, I've taken people to\na cold, dunk or an ice bath.\nI have a family member who wouldn't get in\nliterally passed her toes.\nShe was like, this is\njust too aversive for me.\nSome people really like the\ncold, people very tremendously.\nGetting into an ice\nbath is very interesting\nbecause you have a rebound\nincrease in thermogenesis.\nNow you should know from\nthe previous episode\nthat as that temperature increases,\nit will shift your circadian rhythm\nand which direction it\nshifts your circadian rhythm\nwill depend on whether\nor not you're doing it\nduring the daytime or late in the day.\nIf you do it after 8:00 PM,\nit's going to make your day longer, right?\nBecause your body and your central clocks\nare used to temperature\ngoing up early in the day\nand throughout the day and\npeaking in the afternoon.\nIf you then increase that further\nor you simply increase it\nover its baseline at 8:00 PM\nafter temperature was already falling,\neven if it's just by a half a\ndegree or a couple of degrees\nor you do that with exercise\ndoesn't have to be with the ice bath,\nyou are extending, you are\nshifting forward your phase,\ndelaying your clock.\nYou're convincing your clock\nand therefore the rest of your body\nthat the day is still going, right?\nYou you're giving it the\nperception, the cellar\nand physiological perception\nthat the day is getting longer.\nAnd you will want to\nnaturally stay up later\nand wake up later.\nNow you might say, \"Wait\nI do an ice bath late at\nnight, and I feel great.\nAnd I fall deeply asleep.\"\nWell, cold can trigger\nthe release of melatonin.\nThere's a rebound increase in melatonin.\nSo that could be the cause of that effect.\nYou have to see what works for you,\nbut if you do the ice bath early\nin the day and then get out\nyou will experience a more rapid rise\nor cold shower early in\nthe day, a more rapid rise\nin your body temperature that\nwill phase advance your clock\nand make it easier to get\nup early the following day.\nSo for those of you that are\nhaving trouble getting up\nand this is going to\nalmost sound laughable\nbut a cold shower first\nthing in the morning\nwill wake you up, but that's\nwaking you up in the short term\nbecause of a different mechanism\nwhich I'll talk about in a moment,\nbut it also is shifting your clock,\nit's phase advancing your clock\nin a way that makes you\nmore likely to get up\nearlier the next day, okay?\nSo in other words,\nincreasing your temperature\nby getting in an ice bath\nor cold shower or exercising\nwhich causes a compensatory\nincrease in body temperature.\nThink about the normal\npattern of body temperature.\nLow around 4:35 AM starts to\npeak right around waking start,\nexcuse me, starts to\nincrease right around waking\nthen steep slope, steep slope to a peak\naround four to 6:00 PM and then drops off.\nIf you introduce an\nincrease in body temperature\nby way of cold exposure early in the day,\nlet's say 6:00 AM or 5:00 AM\nif you're masochistic enough\nto get into a cold shower\nat that time more power to you,\nit's going to make, you want\nto wake up about half hour\nto an hour earlier the next\nday than you normally would.\nWhereas if you do it while\nyour temperature is falling,\nit will tend to delay and\nmake your body perceive\nas if the day is getting longer.\nThese are phase advances and phase delays.\nWe're going to get into\nthis in far more detail\nwhen we talk about jet lag\nand shift work in episode four\nas well as other other things.\nBut temperature is,\nagain is not just one tool to manipulate\nwake up time and circadian\nrhythm and metabolism.\nIt is the effector.\nIt is the way that the\ncentral circadian clock\nimpacts all the cells\nand tissues of your body.\nIf you want to read further about this\nand you're really curious\nabout the role of temperature\nwork by Joe Takahashi\nwho used to be at Northwestern University\nand is now at UT Southwestern in Dallas,\nincredible scientist and\nhas really worked out\na lot of the mechanisms around temperature\nin circadian rhythms.\nYou can just Google his name\nand you'll see a whole\nbunch of studies there.\nI want to talk about\ncold and cold exposure\nbecause there's a great\nmisconception about this\nthat actually you can\nleverage once you understand\nhow to use cold to either\nincrease thermogenesis\nand fat loss, metabolism,\nor you can use it for\nstress, mitigation and mood.\nAnd it really depends\non one simple feature\nof how you approach the\nice bath or cold shower.\nIf you get into an ice bath or cold shower\nand you are calming yourself\nyou're actively calming\nthe autonomic nervous system.\nMaybe through some deep breathing,\nmaybe through visualization,\nmaybe you sing a song.\nYou know, people do this stuff.\nThey use various tools.\nSome people find paying attention\nto an external stimulus is more helpful.\nYou know, thinking about something\nnot the experience of the cold,\nother people find that\ndirectly experiencing the cold\nin its most intense form and\nkind of \"going into the cold\"\nis the best way to approach it.\nIt really varies for people.\nThere's no right or wrong\nway to go about this.\nBut the goal of using cold\nexposure for stress inoculation\nand to raise your stress threshold\nto be able to tolerate heightened levels\nof real life stress, not the\nice bath, but real life stress\nlike work stress and\nrelational stress, et cetera\nis by suppressing the activation\nof the so-called\nsympathetic nervous system,\nmeaning the alertness or stress system.\nThat involves buffering\nor trying to resist the shiver response.\nThe shiver response is\nan autonomic response\ndesigned to generate heat, presumably,\nand actually that is what it does\nin order to counter the cold.\nSo when you use cold exposure\nand you're kind of muscling through it,\nor you're learning to relax within it\nas a form of stress inoculation,\nthat's great and works\nquite well for that purpose.\nAnd there's a reason why\ncold exposure is used\nin a variety of forms of\nmilitary stress inoculation,\nmost famous of which of\ncourse is the Navy seal buds,\na strep test really,\nwhich is screening procedure\nfor becoming a seal\ninvolves a lot of exposure to cold water.\nHowever, if you're interested\nin using cold exposure\nfor fat loss and thermogenesis,\nyou want to do the exact opposite thing.\nThere was a paper published\nin nature two years ago\nwhich showed that cold induced shiver,\nthe actual physical shiver\nactivates the release of\na chemical in the body from\nmuscle called succinate\nS-U-C-C-I-N-A-T-E.\nSuccinate travel in the\nbloodstream and then goes\nand activates a particular category of fat\nnot the typical kind pink or white fat\nthat we think of is\nlike blubber in humans.\nThat the stuff that people will seem to\ngenerally want less of,\nexcept for those genetic freaks\nthat seem to have none of it\ndepending what they consume.\nCongratulations.\nBrown fat is called Brown fat\nbecause it's actually\ndark under the microscope.\nIt's rich with mitochondria\nand it exists mostly\nbetween the scapulae\nand in the upper neck.\nAnd it generates thermogenesis\nand heat in the body.\nIt's rich with a certain category\nof agile anergic receptor,\nin insanely epinephrin binds\nto adrenergic receptors.\nThese Brown fat cells increase metabolism,\nit's called Brown fat thermogenesis\nand cause fat burning,\nburning of other kinds of fat,\nthe pink and white fat.\nSo what does this all mean?\nThis means if you want to use the ice bath\nin order to increase\nmetabolism, shiver away.\nIf you want to use the\nice bath or cold shower\nin order to stress\ninoculate, resist the shiver\nand learn to stay calm\nor \"muscle through it\".\nI mean, I don't know that\nanyone's ever really talked\nabout this publicly because\nI think the data are so new.\nAnd I think that people\nassume that the ice bath\nor cold exposure is just one thing.\nHere I've talked about it three ways\nto shift your circadian rhythm\ndepending on whether or not\nyou're doing it early in the day\nwhile your temperature is\nstill rising or at its peak\nor after that peak, in order\nto extend the perception\nof your day as continuing\nand make you want to go\nto sleep later and wake up later.\nNow, and then the third\nway of course is to either\nactivate brown fat thermogenesis\nand increase metabolism.\nI suppose the fourth way would be to\nincrease stress tolerance\nor stress threshold, okay?\nBut remember, temperature is the effector\nof circadian rhythms.\nLight is the trigger.\nThe super charismatic nucleus\nis the master circadian clock\nthat mediates all these changes,\nalso influenced by non-photic influence\nlike exercise and feeding\nand things of that sort.\nBut temperature is the effector.\nNow you can also shift your\ncircadian rhythm with eating.\nWhen you travel and you\nland in a new location\nand your schedule is inverted 12 hours.\nOne way that we know you\ncan shift your rhythm\nmore quickly is to get onto\nthe local meal schedule.\nNow that probably has\nto do with two effects.\nOne or changes in temperature inducer,\neating induced increases\nin body temperature.\nNow you should understand\nwhy that would work\nas well as eating has this\nanticipatory secretion\nof beta, of hyper cretin orexin\nthat I talked about it earlier.\nSo, if this is getting a\nlittle too down in the weeds,\ndon't worry about it.\nI will get more into this in episode four\nof how to shift one's rhythm.\nBut I would love for people\nto understand that light\nand temperature are the\nreal heavy duty leavers\nwhen it comes to moving\nyour circadian rhythm\nand sleep times and activity schedules\nand exercise and feeding can help,\nbut really temperature and light,\nwith light being the primary\none are the most important\nwhen it comes to sleep and wakefulness.\nMany people asked questions\nabout food and neurotransmitters\nand how those relate to\nsleep, wakefulness and mood,\nwhich is essentially 25 hours\nof content for me to cover.\nBut I'm going to try and distill\nout the most common questions.\nWe've talked a lot about\nneuromodulators like dopamine,\nacetylcholine and norepinephrine.\nYou may notice in those\ndiscussions that the precursors\nto say serotonin is tryptophan.\nTryptophan actually comes from the diet.\nIt comes from the foods that we eat.\ntyrosine is the precursor to dopamine.\nIt comes from the foods that we eat.\nAnd then once we ingest them\nthose compounds are\ncirculated to a variety\nof different cells and tissues,\nbut it is true that our food\nand the particular foods we can influence,\nthings like neuromodulator\nlevels to some extent,\nit's not the only way,\nbecause there are also enzymes\nand biochemical pathways\nthat are going to regulate\nhow much tyrosine gets\nconverted into dopamine\nand there are elements of\nthe dopaminergic neurons,\nthe dopamine neurons\nthemselves that are electrical\nthat have influence on this as well.\nBut there are a couple fair\nassumptions that we can make.\nFirst of all, nuts and meats\nin particular red meats,\ntend to be rich in things\nlike tyrosine, right?\nThat tells you right there,\nthat because tyrosine is\nthe precursor of dopamine,\nand dopamine is the\nprecursor of norepinephrine,\nand epinephrine that those\nfoods tend to lend themselves\ntoward the production of dopamine\nand epinephrin and the sorts of things\nthat are associated with wakefulness.\nNow, of course, the\nvolume of food that we eat\nalso impacts our wakefulness.\nIf we eat a lot of anything,\nwhether or not it's ribeye\nsteaks, rice, or cardboard,\nplease don't eat cardboard,\nyour stomach if it's\nvery distended it will\ndraw a lot of blood into your\ngut and you will divert blood\nfrom other tissues and\nyou'll become sleepy.\nSo it's not just about food content,\nit's also about food volume, all right?\nFasting states generally are\nassociated with more alertness,\nepinephrin so forth and fed\nstates are generally associated\nwith more quiescence and\nrelaxation, serotonin,\nand the kind of things that\nlend themselves more towards\nsleep and less toward alertness.\nFoods that are rich in\ntryptophan tend to be things\nlike white meat, turkey,\nalso complex carbohydrates.\nSo if you like you can start experimenting\ndepending on what foods you eat.\nYou can start experimenting\nwith carbohydrate rich meals\nfor accessing sleep and\nmore depth of sleep.\nThis is actually\nsomething I personally do.\nI tend to eat pretty low\ncarbs during the day.\nI actually fast for until about noon.\nNot because I have to work to do that,\nbut because I'd rather just drink caffeine\nand water during that time.\nAnd then sometime around noon\nI can't take it anymore and I'm hungry.\nAnd I eat and I try and eat low carb-ish\nunless I've worked out extremely hard\nin the previous two\nhours, which I rarely do,\nalthough I do it sometimes.\nAnd that meal is then\ndesigned to prolong my period\nof wakefulness into the late afternoon.\nAnd then sometime around dinner time\nwhich for me is around 6:37 PM, 8:00 PM.\nSometimes as late as 9:00\nPM, I tend to eat things\nlike white meat, fish, pastas,\nrice, that kind of thing.\nMy favorite food of all\nfor accessing tryptophan\nis actually a starch.\nIt's actually a vegetable.\nAnd it's the croissant, which\nis my favorite vegetable.\nI don't eat those all\nthe time, but I love them\nand they seem to increase\ndopamine as well.\nI've never actually done\nthe mass spectrometry\non a croissant, but they\ndefinitely increase tryptophan\nand relaxation for me.\nIn all seriousness, low\ncarbohydrate/fasted/ketogenic diets\ntend to lend themselves toward wakefulness\nby way of increasing epinephrin,\nnorepinephrine, adrenaline\ndopamine, and things of that sort.\nCarbohydrate rich meals.\nAnd I suppose we talked about\nmeals as opposed to diet\ntend to lend themselves more\ntoward tryptophan, serotonin\nand more lethargic states.\nThere is very limited\nevidence that I am aware of\nthat carbohydrates should\nbe eaten at one time a day\nas it relates to metabolism, et cetera.\nI'm sure that will open up\na certain amount of debate.\nIf you work out very hard\nand you deplete glycogen,\nthen this all changes.\nSo some people are working out very hard\nin depleting glycogen\nand other people are not.\nThat gets way outside the context\nof this particular podcast,\nbut yes indeed different foods\ncan bias different neuromodulators\nand thereby can modulate awaking\nor our feelings of\nlethargy and sleepiness.\nThere are a couple effects\nof food that are independent\nor I should say a couple\nof facts of eating,\n'cause the food won't\ndo it when it's sitting\nacross the table, but of\neating that are powerful\nfor modulating circadian,\nrhythm, wakefulness, et cetera.\nAnd that's because every time we eat\nwe get eating induced thermogenesis\nregardless of what we eat.\nNow that eating induced thermogenesis\nand increase in metabolism,\nwhich is an increase\nin temperature really,\nis probably greatest for amino\nacid rich foods like meats,\nbut also other types of foods.\nIt's a minimal increase\nin body temperature\ncompared to say cold exposure or exercise.\nNow, whether or not it's\na quarter of a degree\nor half a degree or a degree,\nit really depends on the individual.\nAnd of course there are\nblood sugar effects.\nThere are things like whether or not\nyou are type one or type two diabetic,\nwhether or not you're insulin resistant,\nwhether or not like there's a kid who\ninterns on the podcast\nhere, who's 17 years old\nand I'm convinced that he can eat anything\nand he just seems to like burn it up\nand he's growing it every time.\nActually the other day, he\nwalked into the other room\nand two days later, he\nwalked out of the same room.\nHe came out in between of course,\nbut and I was like, you're grow?\nAnd he was like, you know,\nbut he's at that stage where\nhe's just growing.\nFood is going to affect a\nteenager very differently\nthan it's going to affect\na full-grown person.\nSo, in general, starchy\ncarbohydrates, white meat,\nsuch as turkey, some fish\nincreased tryptophan,\ntherefore serotonin, therefore\nmore lethargic states more calm.\nMeat, nuts and there are\nprobably some plant-based foods\nthat I'm not aware of and I apologize,\nI should read up on this that\nalso are high in tyrosine\nthat can increase things like dopamine,\nnorepinephrine, epinephrin alertness.\nSo you can vary these however you like.\nMost people I think are eating\na variety of these things\nin a given meals.\nAnd there are other\nparameters of nutrition\nthat are important too.\nVolume of food for the reasons\nthat I mentioned before,\nthe volume of food in the\ngut, less food in the gut\nwhether or not it's empty\nor a small amount of food\nwhich tend to correlate with wakefulness.\nLarge volumes of food of any\nkind will tend to correlate\nand drive the calming response\nand that's by way of this\nnerve pathway called the vegas.\nWe actually have sensory fibers\nin the gut that communicate\nto a little protrusion of neurons\nthat sit right next to the\njuggler called the nodose ganglia\nN-O-D-O-S-E unlike Costello,\nit's no dose right now he's all dose.\nNodose actually means\nhaving many protrusions\nand it's like kind of a\nlumpy collection of neurons.\nA ganglia is just a collection of neurons.\nAnd then it goes into the\nbrain stem and then forward\nin the brain to the areas of\nthe brain they're involved\nin production of various neuromodulators.\nSo what we eat and the volume of food\nare both signaling to the brain.\nIt's not just one or the other.\nAnd then there's also this\neating induced thermogenesis.\nAnd now, you know, from the\ndiscussion about temperature\nthat if you're eating early in the day\nyou're tending to shift\nyour rhythm earlier.\nSo that you'll want to wake\nup earlier the next day\nif you're eating very late in the day,\neven if you can fall asleep after that,\nthere's a tendency for\nyou to want to sleep later\nthe next day.\nNow this of course is all\ngoing to be constrained by\nwhen your kids need to eat,\nand when your spouse needs to eat,\nand when your friends need to eat,\nor if you live alone or what\nother things you're doing,\nif you're like me and you\nkind of don't eat until noon\nthen eat sometime around noon.\nAnd then I'm terrible about meals.\nI just start eating the ingredients\nwhile I'm supposed to be cooking\nand then eventually they're all gone\nand I guess that's a meal.\nIt varies.\nSome people are neurotically attached\nto a particular meal schedule.\nSome people are not.\nI take my light exposure\nschedule far more seriously\nthan I take my meal schedule.\nAlthough in general, try\nand eat healthy foods\nfor the most part croissants included.\nI was asked several times whether or not\nmen and women or males and females\ndiffer in terms of these\nneurotransmitter phenotypes\nand the rhythms of sleep and temperature,\nor we could probably devote a whole month\nand we probably will\ndevote an entire month\nto what are called sex differences\nbecause those tend to be related to things\nwe absolutely know like\nXX, or XY chromosomes\nor XYY in some cases\nare double X chromosomes\nas opposed to gender, sex\nand karyotype as we call it\ngenetic makeup is crystal clear.\nThere are things that\ncorrelate with one or the other\nbut it's complicated\nand it's not something\nthat's been explored in\nwhat I think is enough detail.\nActually recently, I guess\nit was about five years ago,\nthe national institutes of\nhealth made it a mandate\nthat all studies use sex\nas a biological variable,\nand actually explore both sexes of mice,\nboth sexes of humans when\ndoing any kind of study\nbecause there was a bias\ntowards only using male animals\nor male subjects prior to that time.\nSo a lot of data now coming out\nrevealing important sex differences\nthat I think are going\nto have powerful impact\non health practices, et cetera.\nResponse to drugs,\nresponse to just different\nsleep schedules, et cetera.\nPerhaps the most salient and obvious one\nis that during pregnancy\nfemales experience a whole range\nof endocrine and neuro effects\nand we definitely will\ndevote a month to pregnancy\nand childbirth and child rearing.\nAnd for that, I'd really like\nto bring in some experts.\nI've got terrific colleagues\nat Stanford and elsewhere\nthat work on these things,\nso that we can go into\nthose in more depth.\nSo I'm not blowing off those questions.\nI'm just, I'm kind of\npushing them down the road\na little bit where I can give\nyou a more thorough answer.\nSo as we finish up, I\njust want to offer you\nthe opportunity to do an experiment.\nWe've talked about a lot of variables\nthat can impact sleep and wakefulness.\nAnd in keeping with the\ntheme of the podcast\nwe are going to continue to\ntalk about sleep and wakefulness\nand tools for those, and the\nscience behind those tools\nas we go forward.\nBut there are really just\nfour simple parameters\nthat you have control over,\nthat you can immediately start to record\nand take note of just\nto see how you're doing\nwith these things.\nWith no judgment or perhaps no change\nto what you're actually doing.\nIt might be interesting, just\na suggestion to write down\nfor each day when you went\noutside to get sunlight\nand when you did that, relative to waking.\nSo you would write down,\nlike the way I do this\nin my calendar is I'll\nwrite down that I don't\nget exact about it.\nI might say, I woke up at 6:15 and then I,\nas I'll put a W 6:15,\nand then SL for sunlight\nand you'll sometimes\nget outside right away.\nOther times I'm less good at that.\nAnd I'll go out around, let's say seven\nand for how long, I don't maybe\nlike 10, 15 minutes or so.\nAnd then I'll put a little check\nat the times that I\neat my so-called meals.\nAlthough, as I mentioned,\nsometimes my meals are\na bunch of small checks\nthat just kind of extend\nthrough the late hours of the day.\nYours might be more\nconfined to certain times.\nAnd then you might just take\nnote of when you exercised,\njust put down an E for when you exercise.\nWeight training or aerobic exercise.\nAnd you might note when you\nmight've felt chilled or cold\nif you do, or you might've\nfelt particularly hot,\nor if you woke up in the middle of night,\nwhen you felt particularly hot.\nAnd then the last thing\nyou might want to do\nis just write down\nif and when you did a non\nsleep deep rest protocol,\nan STR protocol, that could be meditation,\nthat could be yoga nidra,\nthat could be hypnosis.\nAnything that you're using to deliberately\nteach your nervous system,\nhow to go from more alertness\nto more calmness in the waking state,\neven if it's waking up in\nthe middle of the night\nand doing an SDR protocol\nor in the afternoon,\nor first thing in the\nmorning to recover some sleep\nand ability to perform\nDPOs that you might've lost\nfrom a minimal or poor night's sleep.\nSo you're going to rite\ndown when you woke up,\nwhen you viewed sunlight,\nthat might be in the morning\nand the evening, or just\nthe morning, hopefully\nit's the morning and the\nevening, when you exercised,\nwhen you eat your meals and using a simple\nrecord keeping scheme like W\nfor waking, SL for sunlight\nmaybe you come up with a\nsystem where it's a check\nor an X or something for exercise.\nThis is not designed to make\nyou neurotically attached\nto tracking all your behaviors\nand everything you do.\nI for instance, don't track what I eat.\nIn particular, I kind of\nknow what works for me\nand I'd just try and\nstay within that range.\nBut by doing this you can start to reveal\nsome really interesting patterns.\nPatterns that no answer that\nI could provide you about\nany existing tool or\nprotocol could counter.\nIt's really about taking\nthe patterns of behaviors,\nof waking, and light viewing, and eating,\nand exercise and superimposing that on\nwhat you're learning\nin this podcast and elsewhere of course\nand what you already know\nand trying to see where\ncertain problem or problems or\npain points might be arising.\nMaybe you're eating really late in the day\nand you're waking up\nin the middle of the night, really warm.\nWell, now you would say,\n\"Well, that could be due to\nkind of an increase in temperature\nthat is extending my day\nor maybe you start to find\nthat using cold exposure\nearly in the day is great for you,\nbut using it late, if\nit's too late in the day,\nthat's not great.\nOr if you're into the sauna or it's even\nlike some people, including\nmyself, if I take a hot shower\nor sit in a hot tub or\na sauna late at night,\nwell then I get a compensatory\ndecrease in body temperature\nand I sleep great provided\nI hydrate well enough,\n'cause that can be kind of\na dehydrating thing to sit\nin hot, hot conditions.\nBut if I do the sauna early in the day,\nunless I exercise immediately afterward\nthen I tend to get the temperature\ndrop, which makes sense\nbecause when you get in the\nsauna, you're get vasodilation.\nYou throw off a lot of heat and then you\ngenerally get a compensatory\ndrop in temperature.\nIf you do that early in\nthe day, that's right\nabout the time that temperature\nis trying to entrain the\ncircadian clocks of your body.\nThat's what happens to me.\nOther people, it might\nbe slightly different\nand some people have more\nresilient systems than others.\nSo I just encourage you to\nstart becoming scientists\nof your own physiology of\nyour own brain and body\nand seeing how the\nvarious tools that you may\nor may not be using are\neffecting your patterns of sleep,\nyour patterns of\nattention and wakefulness.\nIt's vitally important\nthat if you do this,\nthat you know that it's\nnot about trying to get\nonto an extremely rigid schedule,\nit's really about trying\nto identify variables\nthat are most powerful\nfor you, and that push you\nin the direction that you want to go.\nAnd changing the variables\nthat are pushing your body\nand your mind in the directions\nthat you don't want to go.\nSelf experimentation is\nsomething that should be done\nslowly, carefully, you don't\nwant to be reckless about this.\nAnd this is where I would\nsay manipulating one\nor two variables at a time\nis really going to be best\nas opposed to changing of\na dozen things all at once\nto really identify what it is\nthat's most powerful for you.\nAs always, thank you so\nmuch for your questions.\nWe are going to continue\nto answer questions.\nI certainly didn't get to all of them\nbut we tried to get to\nmost all of the ones\nthat were frequently asked.\nEpisode four of the podcast,\nI'm going to get into,\nshift work, jet lag and\nage dependent changes\nin sleeping and wakefulness and cognition.\nSo for those of you with kids,\nfor those of you that are kids\nfor those of you with older\nrelatives or who might be older\nmeaning probably when\nyou start to get into\nlate '60, '70 and '80 is\nwhen there's some marked\nbiological shifts in\ntemperature regulation\nand things that relate to sleep.\nAnd for those of you that travel,\nwe're going to talk about jet lag.\nThe shift work discussion\nmight seem only relevant\nto those that work nights, but\nactually that's not the case.\nMost people because of the\nway they're interacting\nwith devices are actually\nin a form of shift work now,\nwhere the days are\ncertainly not nine to five,\nthe so-called banker's hours,\nand then the lights are out at nine\nand they're asleep until 5:00 AM.\nSome people have that\nschedule, most people do not.\nSo episode four, we will go\ndeeply into shift work, jet lag\nage dependent changes in\nsleep alertness and cognition\nand I will touch back on\na few of your questions\nbut don't think that\nif your question wasn't answered\nduring these office hours\nthat we won't get to it, I\nabsolutely will at some point.\nIn addition to that, several of you\nhave graciously asked how you\ncan help support the podcast.\nAnd we very much appreciate that.\nYou can support the podcast\nby liking it on YouTube,\nby subscribing on YouTube,\nby recommending the\nYouTube videos to others,\nas well as subscribing and\ndownloading the podcast on Apple\nwhere you can also leave\na review and on Spotify,\nwe're all three, if you like.\nyou can also help us by\nsupporting our sponsors.\nSo check out some of the sponsor\nlinks that were described\nat the beginning of the episode.\nAnd in general, recommending the podcast\nto people that you know and\nthat you think would benefit\nfrom the information would be terrific.\nAs always I will be continuing\nto post on Instagram.\nYou can expect another podcast\nepisode out next Monday\nabout the topics that we've\nbeen discussing this month\nand above all,\n[upbeat music]\nthank you for your interest in science."
