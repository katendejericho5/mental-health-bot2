    "video_title": "The NASA Nap Culture: Boosting Alertness & Productivity with Short Naps",
    "transcript": "NASA figured this out back in the 1980s.\nThey were looking at ways\nto optimize their astronauts\nbecause when you are up in orbit,\ndepending on what orbit you\nare in, you are rotating\naround the planet maybe\n10, 20 times per 24 hours.\nSo you're seeing 10 to\n20 sunsets and sunrises.\nSo your sleep is a total mess,\nand you can safety check almost everything\nin terms of technology.\nBut the one weak link in a space mission\nis this thing called the human being.\nThat's where errors typically happen.\nAnd what they found was that these naps\nproduced almost a 20% boost in short naps,\n20% boost in their alertness,\nand almost a 50% boost in\ntheir task productivity.\nAnd it was so powerful that it translated\nto the terrestrial employees\nof NASA on the ground,\nand it became what was known\nas the NASA nap culture."
