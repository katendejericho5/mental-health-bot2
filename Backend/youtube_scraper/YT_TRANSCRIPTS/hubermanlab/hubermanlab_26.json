    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Dr Bonnie\nhelper felsher Dr Bonnie helper felsher\nis a professor of Pediatrics and\nAdolescent Medicine at Stanford\nUniversity School of Medicine a\ndevelopmental psychologist by training\nDr Halper felshire is a world expert in\nthe risk behaviors that adolescents\nteens and young adults participate in\ntoday we discuss nicotine use both by\nway of smoking as well as vaping and\necigarette use we also discuss cannabis\nand some of the correlative as well as\npossibly causal data linking cannabis\nuse to psychosis in young adults and we\ndiscussed some of the other common risky\nbehaviors that adolescence teens and\nyoung adults participate in including\nrisky driving behavior alcohol\nconsumption and risky sexual behavior we\ndiscussed the various factors that\nimpact whether or not a young person\nwill participate in Risky behaviors\nincluding the family and home as well as\npeer group and social media and as we\ndiscuss social media we get into a deep\ndiscussion about how marketing is\ncombining with peer pressure in order to\ndrive youth toward particular risky\nbehaviors by the end of today's\nconversation you will have learned from\nDr Halper felshire the latest research\non risk-taking behavior in adolescence\nteens and young adults and what we can\neach and all do to ensure that they\neither avoid these behaviors or if they\nare already engaging in these behaviors\nthat we can mitigate some of the\npotential harms and potentially get them\nto eliminate these behaviors toward\nhaving a life of enhanced mental and\nphysical health before we begin I'd like\nto emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is eight sleep\neight sleep makes Smart mattress covers\nwith cooling Heating and sleep tracking\ncapacity now I've spoken many times\nbefore in this podcast about the\ncritical need to get sleep both enough\nsleep and enough quality sleep when we\ndo that everything our mental health our\nphysical health performance in any\nsports or School Etc all get better and\nwhen we're not sleeping well or enough\nall those things suffer one of the key\nthings to getting a great night's sleep\nis that your body temperature actually\nhas to drop by about 1 to 3° in order to\nfall and stay deeply asleep and in order\nto wake up feeling refreshed your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3° one of the best ways to\nensure that happens is to control the\ntemperature of your sleeping environment\nand with eight sleep it makes it very\neasy to do that you program in the\ntemperature that you want at the\nbeginning middle and end of the night\nyou can even divide the temperature for\ntwo different people if you have two\ndifferent people sleeping in the bed and\nit tracks your sleep it tells you how\nmuch slow wave sleep and rapid eye\nmovement sleep you're getting it really\nhelps you dial in the correct parameters\nto get the best possible night sleep for\nyou I've been sleeping on an eight sleep\nmattress cover for well over 3 years now\nand it has completely transformed my\nsleep for the better if you'd like to\ntry eight sleep you can go to 8sleep.com\nhuberman and save $150 off their pod\nthree cover eight sleep currently ships\nin the USA Canada UK select countries in\nthe EU and Australia again that's\n8sleep.com\nhuberman today's episode is also brought\nTo Us by matina matina makes loose leaf\nand ready to drink yeram mate I often\ndiscuss yeram mate's benefits such as\nregular ating blood sugar it's high\nantioxidant content the ways that it can\nimprove digestion and possible\nneuroprotective effects I also drink\nyamate because I love the taste while\nthere are a lot of different choices of\nyerbamate drinks out there I love matina\nbecause again they have the no sugar\nvariety as well as the fact that both\ntheir loose leaf and their canned\nvarieties are of the absolute best\nquality so much so that I decided to\nbecome a partial owner in the company\nalthough I must say even if they hadn't\nallowed me to do that I would be\ndrinking matina is the cleanest tasting\nand best yeram mate you can find I love\nthe taste of brood loose leaf matina\nyerbamate and I particularly love the\ntaste of maa's new canned cold brew zero\nsugar yerbamate which I personally help\nthem develop if you'd like to try matina\ngo to drink maa.com\nhuberman right now matina is offering a\nfree one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate\ntea and free shipping with a purchase of\ntwo cases of their cold brew yerbamate\nagain that's drink maa.com huberman to\nget the free bag of yamate loose leaf\ntea and free shipping today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by element element is\nan electrolyte drink that has everything\nyou need and nothing you don't that\nmeans zero sugar and the appropriate\nratios of the electrolytes sodium\nmagnesium and potassium and that correct\nratio of electrolytes is extremely\nimportant because every cell in your\nbody but especially your nerve cells\nyour neurons relies on electroly in\norder to function properly so when\nyou're well hydrated and your hydration\nalso includes the appropriate ratios of\nelectrolytes your mental functioning and\nyour physical functioning is improved I\ndrink one packet of element dissolved in\nabout 16 to 32 ounces of water when I\nwake up in the morning as well as while\nI exercise and if I've sweat a lot\nduring that exercise I often will drink\na third element packet dissolved in\nabout 32 ounces of water after I\nexercise if you'd like to try element\nyou can go to drink element spelled\nelm.com\nhuberman to try a free sample pack again\nthat's drink element.com\nhuberman and now for my discussion with\nDr Bonnie helper felshire Dr Helper\nfelshire welcome thank you so much for\nhaving me we're going to talk about a\nvery important and sometimes troubling\nperiod of life not always troubling but\nI think for everyone adolescence and the\nteen years youth essentially is a tricky\nlandscape yes it is it can be yeah as\nour brain and bodies mature we have more\nautonomy in where we take them but that\nmeans also more exposure to the ideas\nsuggestions actions pure pressure of\nothers and um that's sometimes where the\nthe problems arise and who knows\nprobably also where the solutions come\nfrom too from time to time but I think\nas conscientious people um who mind the\nwell-being of others of our species we'd\nall like to know sort of like what are\nthe key features that Mark this stage of\ndevelopment maybe we'll just start off\nby talking about this through the lens\nof um your expertise as a developmental\npsychologist you know what is\nadolescence in the teen years like\nwhat's going on um what sorts of things\nare being worked out\npsychologically um that we might not be\naware of and then we can talk about some\nof the common pitfalls and the\nrisk-taking Behavior everything from\nsmoking vaping drug use um sexual\nbehavior\nuh addictive behaviors as it relates to\nsocial media bullying risky driving\nthere's so much there but uh maybe we\ncould just look at this stage of Youth\nthrough the lens of a developmental\npsychologist and share with us anything\nyou feel is worth worth knowing sure so\nfirst of all ages adolescence uh can be\nanywhere from start starting roughly\naround age 10 some people would say\nending around age 18 maybe 21 if you\nwant to go into young adulthood then\nmaybe mid2\nand really adolescence is a wonderful\ntime of as you said exploration it's a\ntime when first of all marked by pubal\nchanges on set amenes for girls um and\nand really the pubal and physical\ndevelopment SE secondary sexual\ncharacteristics are coming out we also\nhave a lot of emotional development\ngoing on during this time height changes\nare occurring during this time but we're\ngetting a lot of social changes as well\nas you said peer pressures so one misn\nis parents think that they don't matter\nduring adolescence they still really\nmatter but peers also come in and matter\nquite a bit and then teens are really\ntrying to figure out who they are you\nget a lot of questions who am I where am\nI going in life what do I want to do\nwhen I grow up what's important to me\nhow do other people feel about me and\nthen how do I feel about other people so\na lot of the social and psycho Social\nDevelopment is happening as well and you\nget\nasynchronous development too if a young\nperson for example starts puberty at a\nyounger age say 10 where they're\nphysically looking older more mature but\nemotionally in psychosocially they still\nmight be young versus the late matures\nphysical matures who may be not having\nand looking like in a older teener an\nadult till 16 17 18 but they're more\nmature emotionally than others then you\nmight have some confusion to that young\nperson I look older but I don't feel\nolder and stuff like that but it's\nreally this wonderful time of\nexploration for an adolescent and a time\nof really wanting autonomy and wanting\nto make a lot of decisions that we\nshould like them make but there are some\nrisks that we have to be careful about\nat the same\ntime I often heard this word autonomy as\nit relates to this uh stage of you know\npuberty and the teen years you mentioned\nthat kids of the that age still really\nneed their parents um you know in the\nlast gosh 20 30 years in this country\nthere's been a market increase in the\nfrequency of divorce um is there any\ndirect evidence that single parent homes\nor homes where I don't know people are\nremarried or just basically divorced\nhomes are somehow um creating more\nchallenges in terms of risk-taking\nbehavior in adolescence and teens or um\nor not because I know plenty of people\nwho had you know grew up in single\nparent homes um sometimes parents\nremarried and sometimes didn't and I by\nmy mind I can't seem to come up with any\ndirect correlation you know plenty of uh\nthose kids did fine and plenty of kids\nin two parent homes that I know had had\nchallenges and and vice versa yeah I\nhaven't contributed actually that was\nsome my earlier dissertation work and I\nhaven't really contributed to that\nliterature for a while but what you're\nsaying is is pretty accurate to what\nI've seen which is really the literature\nwould say it's not the divorce per se\nit's the conflict that is happening so\nif parents actually get divorced usually\nif the conflict resumes teenagers and\nchildren generally do well and\nparticularly within about two years if\nthe conflict uh resolves if the conflict\nresolves right so you can have two\nparents who are married and living in\nthe same home and may or may not be a\ngood relationship but living in the same\nhome if there's no conflict or that then\ngenerally teens will do well or as\nyou're saying there's not necessarily a\ndirect correlation the problem comes in\nwhether parents are living at home\ntogether or separated or divorced is if\nthere's conflict and then that conflict\ntends to result in social issues\nemotional issues a lot of social anxiety\na lot of feeling like I need to do\nbetter so that way my parents like me\nmore and we see that with children too\nthat's not just adolescence a lot of\ndepression and with depression can come\nself-medication and uh self-medicating\naround other drugs and so on but that\ngenerally is resolved if the conflict\nresolves but as you're saying we're\nseeing adolescent angst regardless of\nparenting uh what we really need though\nit's not a matter of just the divorce or\nnot divorce or the relationship between\nthe parents it's parenting that's\nimportant so parents being good monitors\nbeing involved in their kids' lives not\nthis oh you're 16 you have a car you can\ngo wherever you want and we're not going\nto keep an eye on you we still need\nparents to monitor to pay attention to\nfind out their kids' friends where are\nthey going after school that\ndiscretionary time when parents are\nworking and teenagers come home between\n3 and 5 or 3 and six tends to be the\nmost risky couple of hours they're it's\ncalled discretionary hours where there's\nno parent around and we don't always\nknow where those teenagers are hanging\nout so that's more important knowing\nwhere their children are and what\nthey're doing and that there's some\nadult presence some monitoring then\nwhether or not they're still in a\nrelationship my sense is that\nsmartphones have allowed more\ncommunication and monitoring between\nparents and kids but also more\ninteractions between kids and other kids\nand kids and adults more broadly so is\nthere any evidence that uh the Advent of\nsmartphones is directly creating\nproblems for kids that um has to do with\njust so much more PE PE to peer\ninteraction or peer to-peer exposure\nlike when I was growing up we didn't\nhave smartphones uh if you did something\nstupid like that meaning that kids would\nlaugh at it might get told to a small\ngroup of people maybe a larger group of\npeople but um in general it just kind of\ndidn't go anywhere you're like a I\nscrewed up and then You' get teased a\nbit and then it would kind of dissipate\nbut now of course that can propagate\nvery very far very fast is there any\nevidence that that mere fact is creating\nissues for for kids so I would say it's\nnot a blanket statement I think it\ndepends on the behavior that we're\ntalking about bullying no doubt the\nexample that you gave no doubt that if\nyou mess up if you do something stupid\nit's getting filmed and it's going to go\nviral it will go on social media and\nthen it will perpetuate and escalate\namongst the peers um that we definitely\nknow is happening and certainly in terms\nof drug use and marketing there there's\ndef some peer-to-peer interaction look\nhow cool I am look at the Smoke Ring I\ndid look at other things that I've been\ndoing there there is no doubt but in\ngeneral there are also some good things\nabout it parent communication they can\nmonitor where their children are they\ncan put a tracker on the phone uh I know\nwith my own kids sometimes it was the\nbest way to say you seem a little sad\nwhen face-to-face communication wasn't\nhappening I could use the the phone to\nhave that conversation so yes there is\nsome evidence that overall phones and\nsmartphones have increased risk behavior\nbut it's more the access to the behavior\nand then the viral of really getting\nthat information out like you said if\nsomebody screws up um somebody dresses\nwrong if somebody kisses somebody that\nthat could go pretty viral I wouldn't\nsay that smartphones and social media as\na whole is the problem I think it's\nsituation specific and behavior specific\nthat we're seeing and particularly\naround marketing for example that\nteenagers have more access now to\nYouTube to marketing that they're\npromoting not only are Industries\npromoting for example ecigarettes or\ncannabis promoting to young people but\nteens are promoting to each other and\nthat we didn't see before smartphones\nright we didn't see I took a picture or\nInstagram look at me smoking or look at\nme dressing sexy or look at me looking\ncool or anything like that that did\nhappen before it was more just word of\nmouth so that is definitely where we're\na lot more concerned about social media\num but more my concern about social\nmedia is the outside world targeting\nyoung people and that's where where I've\nbeen the the biggest concern about it\nteenagers targeting each other with\nbullying no doubt big issue but in other\nways there's more support there's more\nsocial\ninteraction the other time I get\nconcerned though around teenagers is is\nmore the social piece of sitting around\ntogether at a table and they're not\ntalking they're on the phones so what we\nreally don't know enough is how is the\nnot getting out and playing and instead\nplaying on a game not going to the park\nand and instead communicating through\nphones how is that changing their social\nand physical development is where I'm\nalso very\nconcerned yeah I uh have family\nrelatives with um who are in their teens\nand it's interesting to see them\ninteract um where they're on their\nphones a lot of the time but I've also\nnoticed that there's a cohort of kids\nthat are really trying to put their\nphones away and just spend time together\nand that was actually directly stated to\nme that oh yeah we hang out and we make\nit a point not to be on our phones when\nwe hang out and then but then of course\nthey'll text or be on the iPad with one\nanother in the evening when they're\napart so they're sort of never apart\nright um but I do think there seems to\nbe at least a sub movement of um kids\nand teens that are trying to do more\nface Toof face interaction with devices\nat least put aside I answer a really\ngood point I've talked to some teens who\nsay that they all they get together and\nthey will deliberately put the phones\nface down in the middle no phones and\nhave dinner have a conversation so I I\nthink you're right I definitely think\nthat that that has been a movement and I\nreally appreciate that and I think\nthat's fantastic I've also seen\ncircumstances where two teens are trying\nto help each other with homework and\nthey're texting each other which is fine\nbut I've often said why don't you just\npick up the phone and call the person\nand in five minutes you can figure out\nthe math assignment instead of 20 30\nminutes of back and forth it's just not\nas efficient unless you're literally\ncopying and showing the picture but is\nthat having a change on their social or\nphysical development or emotional\ndevelopment probably not it's just a\ndifferent world the way that they\ncommunicate and that's why I say I'm\nless worried in some ways as long as\nthey're still getting out and they're\nplaying and they're being creative I'm\nless worried about that kind of social\ninteraction on on phones and social\nmedia it's a different way we don't have\na lot of evidence to say when we're the\nother but if they're still doing the\nthings that they should be doing as\nyoung people my concern is that outside\nworld the the um concern of predatory\nbehaviors the concern of Industry the\nconcern of mass media and marketing to\nteens that's the part that gets me\nparticularly worried yeah well we know\nfor sure that this is the first time in\nhuman evolution that\num humans have essentially written with\ntheir thumbs there's got to be a massive\nexpansion of the brain's representation\nof the thumbs relative to you know 20 30\nyears ago but maybe now would be a good\ntime to talk about risky behaviors uh or\neven just behaviors that are known to\nhave some detriment to health smoking\nand vaping and e cigarettes um primarily\nand we should be probably distinguishing\nbetween nicotine\nand\ncannabis um maybe let's just start with\nnicotine what what are the statistics on\num smoking vaping and ecigarettes just\nrough statistics I I um saw a talk that\nyou did online decided some pretty\noutrageous increases in um or shocking\nincreases in smoking and vaping in the\nlast couple of years just staggering so\nmaybe if you give us the top Contour of\nthose sure absolutely so the good news\nis smoking rates conventional cigarette\nsmoking rates has gone down pretty\ndramatically in the last couple of\ndecades with teenagers with all people\nin the US which is wonderful by\nteenagers to um well below 10% if not\nreally well below 5% of teenagers that's\nthe good news in terms of ecigarette use\nwhich I prefer the term ecigarette use\nthan vaping because they're they're not\nVapes they're aerosols uh but ecigarette\nuse has gone up pretty dramatically so\necigarettes came on the market in the US\nin 200 seven and they were slow to to\nfor uptick amongst teenagers they look\nlike cigarettes when they first came on\nthe market they weren't very popular\nwith teenagers they didn't have they had\nsome flavors not a lot didn't have a lot\nof nicotine it was probably around 2011\nto 2014 we started seeing an uptick but\nthen it was really in 2017 to 19 that we\nsaw a dramatic increase and that was the\nthe statistics there we saw upwards of\n27 to 29% of teens using ecigarettes\nduring th those couple years daily use\npast 30 days so any use in the past 30\ndays okay uh was and in daily use it'll\nbe some smaller percentage of that it\nwas something like a 78% increase in\nhigh school student use and a 48%\nincrease in middle school use over those\ncouple of years so a very dramatic\nincrease in use since 2019 it's gone\ndown but I'm going to give a caveat it's\ngone down in 2020 to the numbers are\nshowing uh they went to around 20% and\nnow around 10% part of that was in 2020\nwe had covid and initiation of\necigarette use really occurs socially\nand going back to socialization it's a\nlot of teens getting together and it's\nnot pure pressure of you have to try\ncome on try this it's more like my\nfriends are using I'm at a party I feel\nlike using yeah I'll try it well during\nthe pandemic and the shutdown teens were\nnot at school they weren't with their\nfriends so initiation went down teens\nwho were addicted and we can certainly\ntalk about levels of nicotine and eats\nbut teens who were addicted continues to\nuse some tried to quit which was great\nbut we still saw a fair amount of use so\npart of the decrease in those 2020 to\n2021 have to do with just access and\nsocialization had changed and so rates\nwent down since then even we publish a\npaper showing relationships between Co\nand vaping we saw evali ecigarette and\nvaping Associated lung illness so that\nthat we think was part of why we also\nsaw further drops around 2021 but people\nwere concerned about their lung health\nand teens as well and that's\ngreat the latest data show that their\nrates are under 10% the National Data I\nactually don't think it's true and the\nreason I don't think it's true is I'm in\nthe schools doing\ncurriculum presentations all the time\nwhere I teach and educate teachers to\nuse our tobacco and cannabis prevention\ncurriculums and we've never been busier\nthan we are right now with schools just\ncrying for help we have an another group\nof teenagers using ecigarettes nicotine\nor cannabis or whatever it's way more\nthan 10% I would say schools are telling\nme it's 40 to 60% of their students are\nusing ecigarettes so for with for\nwe don't know or canis it's very hard to\nknow it's very hard to know what's in\nthere uh but 40 to 60% that's what the\nschools are saying at some point in the\nlast 30 days at some point in the last\n30 days they're catching just exorbitant\nnumbers of students using right now and\nso from a science perspective is it 10%\n20% 30 we don't know I can just tell you\nthat the national CDC data would say 10%\nand maybe it's a problem with the\nsurveys or the questions or teens aren't\nbeing honest but from a school's\nperspective it's much higher and then we\nhave some National Data suggesting it's\nmore in the 20 to 30 to 40% range as\nwell whatever it is it's too many it's\ntoo many teens who are inhaling nicotine\nand and cannabis as well wow a lot to\nunpack there first of all um nicotine I\ndid an episode of the podcast about\nnicotine um and a little bit of that got\num confused in the way it landed\num so I'll just quickly State\nnicotine known cognitive enhancer also\nknown to dramatically increased blood\npressure and vasil constriction not\nhealthy for the body just to be clear\nit's not healthy for the body so when\npeople hear that it's a cognitive\nenhancer increases focus and alertness\nthat's true um in the short term highly\naddictive highly highly addictive um and\nhabit forming since sometimes those are\nseparated maybe we um delve into that\ndistinction but by my\nobservation very few people can use\nnicotine occasionally people who try it\nseem to um like it um at least in the\nshort run and keep using it um so\npresumably kids are\nusing I should say youth are using\nnicotine either by vape\necigarette and they quote unquote like\nthe way it makes them feel who knows\nmaybe it'll allows them to focus on\ntheir studies better I don't know uh but\nit is known to improve certain forms of\ncognition but only transiently and it's\nhighly addictive and it's bad for their\nhealth for anyone's health so that puts\nus in kind of a tricky situation when\nevaluating in the statistics that you\njust uh laid out because uh one wonders\nyou know are they taking it and then\ncontinuing to take it because of peer\npressure because of lack of peer\npressure to not do it because it helps\nthem with their schoolwork um because\nthey're naturally a little bit depressed\nand it provides a kind of um\nanti-depressant signal I mean what what\ndo we know about why they're actually\nstarting and why they're continuing and\nwhy they are reluctant to quit maybe we\njust parse those so why does a teenager\ntry\nnicotine so there are a few reasons why\nthey start um based on the the\nliterature scientific literature and\njust talking to teens one has to do with\nthe marketing no doubt if you look at\nthe marketing it is targeting young\npeople uh it's targeting them with first\nof all the devices themselves they are\ncool looking uh they're easy to hide\nthey look like USB devices they look\nlike highlighters in fact there's a new\nbrand out called highlight that is a\nhighlighter that's a working highlighter\nbut it's actually a nicotine ecigarette\nso a highlighter pen to to study\nhighlighter pen to study and then but\nit's actually you take the cover off and\nit's actually a nicotine ecigarette\ndevice clearly marketed toward students\nclearly marketed towards students wow\nyou have what's it called Boba uh you\nknow um teas drinks oh yeah the tea with\nthe yeah a little mimicking that drink\nthat's actually a that the straw is\nactually The Vaping inhaling there\nlittle pieces you have um Star Wars\nshapes you know it goes on and on just\nthe cartoon shapes that are clearly\nbeing targeted to not just teenagers\nchildren that we're sing CH children\nlike young children children like young\nchildren so wait so I'm I'm I'm\num shocked so kids younger than 10 are\nare having these products push their way\nthey are and actually I didn't tell you\nin the statistics the statistics I was\nciting I should go back and clarify a\ncouple there to that are even more\nshocking so those are the numbers for\nmiddle and high school we don't have\ndata from elementary but again the other\npart of in addition to the science I\ncontribute to the interventions I do I\nam getting Elementary School teachers\ncalling us for help they are catching\nsecond and third graders using nicotin\ncigarettes I'm not kidding and not just\none or two quite a bit we said we would\nnever develop an elementary school\nversion of a vaping prevention\ncurriculum that's what we call our uh\nyou and me together vaperee we would\nnever we have a middle school and a high\nschool we were never going to do\nelementary we've had so many schools\nacross the country call us and say we\nneed something for elementary so we\nactually created a curriculum so we're\nhaving there there was a story of an\n8-year-old uh back East who was caught\nand using and and the teachers and\npolice didn't know what to do and of\ncourse I said it's not a police matter\nwhy aren't we helping this young person\nso we are we're we're seeing younger now\nsometimes they're starting because\nthey're siblings older siblings uh it's\nbeing marketed to it they don't realize\nthat it's a nicotine ecigarette or\ncannabis ecigarette they just don't\nrealize what it is but the number of\nthese products that are being targeted\nto young people is absolutely ridiculous\nous what they look like uh the pictures\nare endless and the problem is they're\ncoming out with new products every few\nmonths that are targeting\nkids so\nmarketing the other is flavors and\nflavors and marketing go hand in hand\nyou know if it if it looks bad looks\nlike or and smells like and tastes like\nnicotine or tobacco teens know that\nthat's gross that's why we don't have\ncigarette use anymore teens we've\nsocialized our country to say if you\nsmell tobacco it's it's nothing that we\nwant to smell we walk away from it you\nwalk across the street whatever we've\ndone a really good job in Tobacco\nControl getting the word out around that\nthese products e cigarettes smell and\ntaste like sugar like sweets like\ndessert like candy so you've got and and\nthe names are things like unicorn poop\nand sugar booger and honey dooo that's\nnot for adults those names are squarely\nfor kids it's kids who are using\nchocolate it's kids who are using these\nflavors that are on the market and then\nthe marketing around it are these I mean\nthey're beautiful they're these you know\nPizzazz of pineapple dancing around or\nof you know um strawberries dancing or\nwhatever it is that are very animated\nthey're a juice box style that uh that\nhave come out juice boox style vaping\ndevices that are marketed looking like\njuice boxes again that's that's not\ntargeting you and me that's targeting a\nkid interesting and uh scary uh to hear\nall this I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now\nmost of you have heard me tell my story\nabout how I've been taking ag1 once or\ntwice a day every day since 2012 and\nindeed that's true I started taking ag1\nand I still take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed

adults in\nthe US Vapor use ecigarettes just by way\nof comparison so I've seen numbers\nanywhere from 5% to around 20% depending\non the statistic I actually haven't\nlooked at the latest data on on adults\num but but the majority of adults who\nare using are it's a little bit\ndifferent to think about it adults are\nusing generally they're not initiating\ntobacco through ecigarettes they're\ngenerally and I'm talking 30 and up they\ngenerally have been smoking cigarettes\nand then maybe they're trying to use\necigarettes to quit which is a whole\nanother uh set of literature that it's\nnot say as effective as we're hoping\nthat it is there isn't good literature\non a popul ation level that ecigarettes\nhelp adults quit uh\ncigarettes the difference with teenagers\nis they're initiating with ecigarettes\nand they're not saying huh here's a\ncigarette here's an ecigarette which one\ndo I choose it's not that they're\nsubstituting or replacing they're not\nusing cigarettes some are now because\nthey're switching back and forth but\nthey're initiating with these cigarettes\nthey're initiating because of the\nmarketing they're initiating because of\nthe flavors and the products and the\nability to hide it parents don't know\nwhat these products look like so the\nlandscape is very different so you were\ntelling us Why teens and Adolescent\nstart vaping and marketing is clearly\noriented toward them there are a number\nof reinforcing factors that at least to\nmy mind as you're describing all this\nmake it sound like the stuff is supposed\nto be quote unquote playful that it's\nit's not um it's not a drug that sort of\nthing reminds me a little bit of sugary\ncereals when I was a kid you'd buy this\nthe cereal cuz you wanted the taste but\nyou also wanted the colorful box you had\nthe you know the cartoons that it\nrelated to on TV and there's usually a\ntoy inside that you wanted some surprise\nthat you could then collect across boxes\nso there was a lot of levels of incentiv\nforation why do they keep smoking or\nvaping are they addicted to nicotine\nyeah absolutely so so the other reason\nwhy they start is they like like the\ntaste and they like the rush so I've\ntalked to so that's the other piece as\nso a few more reasons why they start and\nthen and then certainly answer your\nquestion around the nicotine um teens\nhave told me outright that they like the\ntaste they like the rush they like the\nbuzz and we could talk about how much\nnicotine is in there it's astonishing\nand I can explain that but they like the\nbuzz they they another reason by the way\nis stress and coping right now teens are\nso stressed out they' they've been\nstressed out for years but they're\nparticularly stressed with the pandemic\nand even though we're a couple years out\nof the lockdown teens are still they're\nhaving socialization issues social\nemotional learning issues they're still\nconfused uh they missed a couple of\nyears particularly high school students\nmay have missed part of middle school\nwhere you're learning to socialize with\nother people so they're very stressed\nand we know that there's a pretty strong\nrelationship between stress not being\nable to cope and using any drug but incl\nNico\ntee so there's a lot of different\nreasons why young people and certainly\nthe peers and again it's not peer\npressure it's more like a lot of friends\nare using it I've talked to teens who\nsay I wasn't intending on but I tried it\nand wow I really like the taste I like\nthe flavor and then there's the amount\nof nicotine that's in there in\n2015 when the newer products came on the\nmarket it was a salt-based\nnicotine so cigarettes and then earlier\necigarettes have a freebased nicotine\nfreebased nicotine uses ammonia and\nsugar to bind to the nicotine and the\nother chemicals there's hundreds of\nchemicals in there to go through the\nbody lungs into the brain and give you\nthat\nRush the free based nicotine is very\ncostic if you think the litmus test it's\nvery much on the basic side of the\nlitmus test there and if you're a\nnicotine naive youth which again Most\nteens starting with nicotine ecigarettes\nhave not used nicotine before\nwhen you start you don't want that\ncostic throat hit feeling that's how\nit's described teens will say they don't\nlike it they cough it tasted bad well to\nan adult who's been using cigarettes\nthey don't mind that they're used to it\nbut a teen is not well I will mention\njuel here because it's relevant juel\ncame on the market in 2015 with a\nsalt-based nicotine which essentially uh\nfor those who aren't familiar with CTIC\nand um litmus tests and things like that\nthe salt-based nicotine as I understand\nis quote unquote smoother it's um it\ncauses less U sort of coughing um static\ncontraction of the the muscles in the\nmouth and throat you know and so it's\nbasically more palpable and more of a of\na kind of gradual on-ramp which is\nexactly what a company wants um if you\nwant somebody to start using something\nyou don't want to hit them Square in the\nface that's exactly right that's exactly\nright so salt-based nicotine generally\nuses benzoic acid to move that Li Mist\ntest needle from the CTIC towards acidic\nbecause it's it's an acid but really\ntowards neutral so exactly so when you\nuse it it's smooth it's easy to use you\ndon't have that throat hit you don't\ncough you don't feel sick from it so\nteens will say and I I've talked to\nteens and young adults who tried earlier\necigarettes and didn't like it and then\ntried the salt Bas style and said oo I\nlike it couple with the flavors it's\nalso more absorbent so there's some\nsuggestion and some early evidence that\nit's also more\naddictive so when those products first\ncame on the market before earlier\necigarettes had say 0 to 36 milligram of\nnicotine suddenly we jumped up to 59 Mig\nper mil which is about generally about a\n40 41 milligram uh because it's about a\n7 mil uh sorry little chemistry and math\nthat we a lot here but you're looking at\nbasically it's anywhere from the\nnicotine that you see in either one to\ntwo packs of cigarettes per per device\nper pod per ecigarette device and how\nlong does a pod typically last a let's\nsay like a 15 or 16 year old kid who's\num you know taking a hit off The Vape\nPen um I don't know what five times a\nday so I've asked teens in some of the\nearly earlier Publications we did now\nnot with the newer devices but the older\ndevices and they would say that they\nwere using a pot a week which is about\ntwo or three cigarettes a day to one to\nfour pods a day one to four pods a day\none to four now these are highly\naddicted teenagers that is one to eight\npacks of cigarettes depending on the\ndebates on how much nicotine is in there\nbut you're looking at several packs of\ncigarettes worth of nicotine okay so\njust to backtrack a little bit because\nwe got a little bit um technical um\nwhich is great but I want to make sure\neveryone's on board the amount of\nnicotine in one of these pods that goes\ninto the vape pen or EIG\nis significantly greater than the amount\nof nicotine in one pack of cigarettes in\nmany cases in many cases and there are\nmany youth so adolescence and\nteens you said before between ages of 10\nand 21 roughly 10 to 18 10 to 21 that\nare going through as many as four pods\nper day which has to be at least the\nequivalent of four packs of cigarettes\nbut could be as much as eight packs of\ncigarettes per day correct in terms of\nnicotine concentration correct now I I\nguess to be fair they are not smoking in\nthe traditional sense so that presumably\nthere's some tars and other contaminants\nthat are not going into their system but\nwe know that there are a lot of\nchemicals in these pods besides just\nnicotine and I think that's where a big\nsource of the um debate and interest is\nnow is you know how dangerous are those\nthose other chemicals is really an\ninteresting question so um a lot of\nthings that you said are really\nimportant to highlight U absolutely now\nnot all teenagers are using four pods a\nday these are extreme very highly\naddicted teens uh and and unfortunately\nteens we've seen with lung collapses and\nand other pretty significant health\nissues typically teens are using maybe a\npod a day the newer ecigarettes by the\nway\nhave probably four times that they're\nbigger volume so you're looking at 60 70\nMig of nicotine some of them are\nequivalent to about 3 to 500 cigarettes\nworth of nicotine now are they using\nthem in a day probably not we haven't\ndone the studies on that but it's really\nthe first nicotine product we've had\nthat you can use 247 when I've talked to\nteens you know I wake up in the middle\nof the night I may check my phone and\ncheck my email teens are waking up in\nthe middle of the night to take a hit\nand they're they're hiding them under\ntheir pillows in their nightstands\nwhatever and they're telling me that\nthey're just using them all the time and\nthey could just suck on them all the\ntime are they using when you say all the\ntime that's interesting forgive me for\ninterrupting but no no no are they using\nit specifically to wake up to study to\num or just to maintain Baseline I mean\nthat's the that's the problem with any\naddictive substance or habit forming\nsubstance is that what starts off as a\nrush becomes less of a rush and then um\nwhen one doesn't use they feel below\nbasic Baseline I've done a lot of\ndiscussions about dopamine and Baseline\nversus you know um non-baseline peaks in\ndopamine and some of that is smooth out\nfor General discussion uh dopamine does\nmany things besides set up reward\nsystems and um incentives in the brain\nbut it's at least one of the things it\ndoes so are kids starting off taking\nnicotine and then and feeling like whoa\nthat makes them feel really elevated in\nterms of mood focus and alertness and\nthen finding that without it they're\njust depressed is that is that the\ngeneral them I'm not trying to lead the\nthe the witness here I just want to know\nwhat what's what's going on internally\nabsolutely no no no all all great um\nquestions there so what we're what we're\nfinding when we talk to teens is that\npretty rapidly they're going from I like\nit to I need it so you know your your\nmulti-art question which is great what\nmakes them start and what makes them\ncontinue they start because of the\nflavors and and the marketing and they\nlike the The Taste and all that they\ncontinue because of that high level of\nnicotine and we are seeing that teens\nare addicted and we're seeing we\nactually published a couple of studies\nshowing that teens who have been using\necigarettes in the past 30 days that the\nmajority are showing signs of addiction\npretty rapidly too within a few weeks\nit's such high levels of nicotine and\nthere are some people who don't believe\nthat teens are becoming addicted to\nnicotine and that you the levels of\nnicotine are not the same as what we're\nseeing in cigarettes that's actually not\nthe case and we've seen more and more\nstudies and to the question of using it\nas soon as they wake up there's a study\nby colleague of mine that showed in the\nlast few years the the data are showing\nthat teens a greater percentage of teens\nwho use ecigarettes are doing so in the\nfirst five minutes a waking that is a\nsign of addiction so you wake up maybe\ngo to the bathroom maybe not and you\ntake that hit and so and all the\nNational Data are showing even though\niniti ition may go down the percentage\nof teens who we're using daily has gone\nup and I attribute that a lot to the\ntype of nicotine the salt-based nicotine\nand to the huge amount of nicotine\nthat's been on the market so yes teens\nare definitely feeling it they're\ndefinitely going through withdrawal\nsymptoms that that feeling uh shaking\nthe the sweats all the feelings that\nthey need lack of\nconcentration the problem is when you\ntalk to teens they they think that\necigarettes are helping with school and\nand by the way I've not heard a teen\ntell me that they started because of\nschool reasons or\nconcentration maybe they're continuing\nfor that reason but teens have said that\ntaking the hit makes them feel good what\nthey don't understand is it's that it\nmakes them feel not bad right the\nwithdrawal is making them feel bad and\nthey don't realize that that hit and\nthat that doping room Rush that they now\nneed it that they're going through a\nwithdrawal either way\nI'm wondering where they're getting the\nmoney to pay for all this uh nicotine\nwhen I was a kid I worked um I like mode\nLawns I had a newspaper out for a little\nwhile but mostly um started working when\nI I think I was about 14 or so coffee\nshop skateboard shop um bus tables did\nthat kind of thing so I made money and I\nwas able to use that money on the things\nthat were important music skateboarding\nand bus passes and stuff that that's\nwhat it was back then\nfood um\nEtc where are 12-year-olds getting the\nmoney to buy four or even one Vape\ncartridge pod as you called it um per\nday I mean someone's got to pay for this\nstuff um I mean unless they're stealing\nit and I can't imagine that they're all\nstealing it where are they getting it\nhow are they getting it yeah it's a\ngreat question so there's not one way uh\nin terms of money I think there's\nquestions around money and questions\naround access right and they're not\nnecessarily the the same thing money\nbabysitting the problem is when some of\nthe newer products came on the market\nsome of them the the say 2020 2021\nproducts were about a dollar or two per\npod compare that with a pack of\ncigarettes which is $10 to $15 depending\non the state you live in so they are\ncheap they're easy to get now newer ones\nand older ones are a few dollars more\nbut they're not that expensive they\nstarted off very expensive when they\nfirst came on the market Market but they\nhaven't been the other is the sharing\nand we used to hear about pod parties\nwhere somebody buys the device which is\nmore expensive buys the device and then\nyou bring your own not beer bring your\nown pod which is a few dollars then you\npop it in and then you share it\naround um we've also heard stories of a\nfew teenagers buying them and then\nselling for a few cents or a few dollars\na puff so meet me in the bathroom for 50\ncents or a dollar you can have a couple\nof Puffs so I think teens are getting\nvery very creative we've also seen\nunfortunately parents buying e\ncigarettes for their teens well at least\nthey're not smoking\ncigarettes that's not the right\ncomparison um so I think they're very\ncreative they're getting into many many\ndifferent ways I've heard students say\nI'm not using my lunch money to buy\nlunch I'm going to use it to buy Vapes\num there's no one way uh there's not\nand unfortunately access is easier than\nit should by the way one thing I think\nis incredibly important for people to\nunderstand is across the US in 2019\nDecember 2019 the legal age to be\nallowed to purchase or to sell nicotine\nproducts across the US is is become 21\nso many people think it's so 18 so you\ngo into a vape shop or a tobacco shop\nand if the shop owner doesn't realize\nit's 21 they'll sell it to somebody\nwho's 18\nand even if they know it's 21 they're\nstill selling it because there's not\nenforcement right now going on so we\nreally do need our the public we need\nall the parents listening we need\nEducators police officers to really\nenforce the and regulate this age\nrestriction because teens are getting\nthem from vape shops really easily\nthey're getting it online really easily\num they're buying them for each other\nsomebody's going and buying 10 and and\nthen reselling them if the looks older\nthere's not a lot of carding going on or\nfake cards ID cards is pretty easy still\nto get so unfortunately we have a\nproduct that is appealing to teens in a\nvery unregulated market right now the\nFDA is not regulating it local shops are\nnot regulating it that it's just it it\nis the wild west out there so setting\naside the issue of whether or not vaping\nis quote unquote better for us than\nsmoking cigarettes\nbecause that argument is um a\ncomplicated one uh to say the least what\ndo we know about the health hazards of\nvaping per se um does it increase\num lung disease does it increase cancer\nrates I mean um my understanding is that\nnicotine the chemical is not what causes\ncancer in cigarettes it's the tars and\nother things that um are consumed or\nbrought into the lungs and therefore\nblood stream when one smokes um that's\nnot to say nicotine is safe I have to be\ncareful here sometimes Clips get cut and\npeople run wild and I I'm not saying\nnicotine is safe but\num what are the problems with vaping\nnicotine um even let's just say one or\ntwo hits per day um especially in kids\nyou know do we do are there known\nchallenges for brain development are\nthere known challenges for cognitive\ndevelopment are there known challenges\nfor um lung function is it I mean\nnicotine is a vasoconstrictor and it\nraises blood pressure so that's\nbasically stress on the system chronic\nstress uh but yeah what do we know about\nwhat um vaping and ecigarettes are doing\nto malign\nHealth yeah so first of all start with\nthe brain and and nicotine uh absolutely\nthese high levels of nicotine and really\nany nicotine is harmful to the\ndeveloping brain and our brains continue\nto develop until we're around 25 24 or\n26 depending but to around 25\nso in that process of of your brain\ndeveloping of your brain changing if you\nintroduce nicotine you're changing your\nbrain you're changing the brain\nchemistry and you're so much more likely\nto become addicted as an adolescent and\nyoung a young adult the tobacco industry\nknows this I mean they that's why they\ntarget teens we've no this with\ncigarettes if we target a teen then\nwe're going to have have them for life\nso significantly more likely to become\naddicted because it actually rewires\nyour brain and there's plenty of\nevidence for that the the other pieces\nthat we're worried about is now you're\nright nicotine in terms of cancer\nalthough I will tell you having talking\nto some oncologist they would say the\nvast amount of nicotine still worries\nthem in terms of cancer we just haven't\nhad enough research on ecigarettes to\nreally know now you're right ecigarettes\ndo not have tar but ecigarettes have\nalahh tides and alahh have been L linked\nto cancer so there's still some concern\nthere there's some early anecdotal\nevidence and probably some of my\ncolleagues out there would say no no\nthere's pretty good evidence around\ncancer I we just don't have enough body\na\nresarch but again it took 50 years to\nfigure out cancer and cigarettes we've\nnot had the amount of ecigarette use or\nor that we saw with cigarettes for that\nlong for that many people to really know\nit's still pretty new I just might want\nto just interject the alahh tides um\nlike parap from alahh from Malahide\nthese are the same chemicals that we use\nin Laboratories to um fix as it's called\ntissues to make those tissues firm so\nthat then they can be cut and analyzed\nunder the microscope um alahh highes\ncross-link proteins um basically change\nthe configuration of proteins and turn\nwhat would otherwise be appliable tissue\ninto kind of a hard rubbery think of\nlike a dense eraser like um consistency\nand in other words not the configuration\nmost conducive for those cells to live\nand Thrive actually quite the opposite\num which is why um that's for sake of\ndoing anatomy on well any body part you\nuse param alahh glut alahh um and for\nMalahide to cross-link proteins it\nbasically kills tissue by cross-linking\nproteins taking a nice you know pliable\nconfiguration that's uh amendable to\nlife and twisting the the U or shearing\nthe proteins more or less um relative\ncross-linking them and making them nice\nand rigid so if that's happening in the\nliving child that can't be good that\ncan't be good they can't be good lugs\nbloodstream everything and all the\nalhida cancer right right and so that's\nwhy there's a lot of concern there and\nwhen I talk to teens uh and in our\ncurriculum we we often say uh because\nwhen you just say and you gave a\nbeautiful explanation of the alahh tides\nbut for a teenager what I generally say\nis is if you ever dissected a had\nbiology and you dissect a frog yes how\ndid it smell it was gross well that's\nwhat you're putting into your body when\nyou're vaping uh because that that's\nexactly the point and and that kind of\nhelps them understand it a little bit\nmore but there's a lot of concern around\nthe alahh highes uh there's lead there's\ncadmium there's propylene glycol and\nglycerin so there's a lot of other\nchemicals so no we may not have the\nthousands of chemicals that we have in\ncigarettes but we certainly have\nhundreds of chemicals in an ecigarette\nthat's very concerning so there are a\nlot of studies now really showing pretty\nsignificant effects of ecigarette use on\nheart and lungs a lot\num not only all the chemicals we've\nmentioned but also the flavorants\nthere's cinnamon alide another alahh\nthere's vanilla there's um uh what is it\nthe The Buttery flavor um that's in\nthere is also a lot of concern so that\nyou're inhaling these flavors and I have\noften explain you can take flavors you\ncan take butter and heat it to several\nhundred degrees and eat it if you don't\nburn your tongue but you then take it\nand really inhale the resulting aerosol\nand then we're seeing the the lesions on\nthe lungs we're seeing young people who\nhave been using ecigarettes having lung\ncollapses pneumonia asthma amongst\npeople who have not had seizures uh one\nof the teens I know who was using four\npods a day was having seizures uh so\nmakes sense because nicotine is a\nstimulant yes it can cause runaway\nexcitability in the brain If too much is\ntaken um if 40 to 60% of kids are using\necigarettes um and it's destructive to\nthe lungs uh and it sounds like the\nbrain as well where are all the young\nathletes are they the the remaining um\nuh are they the remaining fraction yeah\nand and I should say 40 to 60 is what\nschools are telling me and that might\njust be using once in a while we don't\nreally know but even kids just like I\nhad to do PE class when I was in high\nschool yeah yeah we had to run a few\nlaps I can't imagine doing that if your\num if your lungs don't function properly\nno it is actually much harder and teens\nwill say that and adults I know I\nactually know an adult who said that\nwhen he went from smoking cigarettes to\neat cigarettes it actually was harder\nfor him to exercise and to ride his Bic\nand and and exercise and do other things\non the ecigarette compared to the\ncigarettes that the the impact on the\nlungs is so strong so you're right it is\nprobably hurting um Athletics right now\nwhere actually there are some\ncurriculums on athletes and and vaping\nand we're building one as well because\nthere's a lot of concern when you tell a\nteen you know I'm worried about lung\ncancer in 20 years years H I don't care\nabout 20 years from now but you would\ntell a teen it's harder to run they're\nmore likely to listen to you I'd like to\ntake a brief break and acknowledge one\nof our sponsors waking up waking up is a\nmeditation app that offers hundreds of\nguided meditations mindfulness trainings\nyoga needer sessions and more I started\nmeditating over three decades ago and\nwhat I found in the ensuing years is\nthat sometimes it was very easy for me\nto do my daily meditation practice I was\njust really diligent but then as things\nwould get more stressful which of course\nis exactly when I should have been\nmeditating more my meditation practice\nwould fall off with waking up they make\nit very easy to find and consistently\nuse a given meditation practice it has\nvery convenient reminders and they come\nin different durations so even if you\njust have one minute or five minutes to\nmeditate you can still get your\nmeditation in which research shows is\nstill highly beneficial in addition to\nthe many different meditations on the\nwaking up app they also have Yoga Nidra\nsessions which are a form of non-sleep\ndeep rest that I personally find is\nextremely valuable for restoring mental\nand physical Vigor I tend to do a Yoga\nNidra lasting anywhere from 10 to 20\nminutes at least once a day and if I\never wake up in the middle of the night\nand I need to fall back asleep I also\nfind yoga Nedra to be extremely useful\nif you'd like to try the waking up app\nyou can go to waking up.com huberman to\ntry a free 30-day trial again that's\nwaking up.com huberman we haven't talked\ntoo much about peer pressure or just\nsocial pressure um I remember when I was\na kid it was in the just say not drugs\nera and um remember seeing the\ntelevision commercials with the eggs\nlike two like really beautiful raw eggs\nand say this is your brain and then was\nthis your brain on drugs and it was\nfrying and you know Nancy Reagan was the\nbig like was everywhere those in that in\nthat time you know just say no just\nsaying no in any case um there must be a\nlot of data indicating that what\nmessages kids respond to I was told and\nI don't know if this is true but I was\ntold by a researcher um that the\nanti-smoking campaign that was effective\nin kids was not one that convinced them\nthat smoking was bad for their health\nbut was one that um convinced them that\nit was um their purchasing and use of\ncigarettes that was making uh other\npeople rich and then um kind of\ndemonizing those people that was\neffective kind of like show uh the\ncommercials of of these guys um you know\nkind of cackling behind closed doors you\nknow making fun of the the people that\nwere um in their words um you know not\nbright enough to know that that they\nwere being taken advantage of and then\nthat set a kind of a psychological\nwarfare between teens and these people\nthat they perceived as I'm taking\nadvantage of them for money right and\nthat that was effective in getting them\nto smoke less as opposed to telling them\nHey listen smoking is really bad for\nyour health right absolutely so first of\nall the just say no not effective say\njust having saying just say no around\nany Behavior to a teenager whether it's\ntobacco cannabis cigarettes um and sex\ndoes not work it does not work and for\nmany reasons first of all te are curious\nand when you say just say no why well\nbecause it's bad for you well wait a\nsecond exactly what you're saying just\ntelling me that it's bad for me if you\ntell me I'm going to get lung cancer or\nI'm going to have lung disease or\nanything and I tried the ecigarette and\nI didn't have lung problems and instead\nI actually liked it then we look bad we\nlook like we're lying to\nteenagers and instead what we were\ntalking about earlier the the feeling\nthe rush the flavor The Taste the\nperceived in real benefits outweigh the\nconcerns over the risks as a teenager so\nwhen we say to a teen just say no don't\nand they say well why well your brain or\nyour heart or your lungs or it's bad for\nyou they don't believe us and and we\nabsolutely Lo lose credibility so we\ntalk to teens and this is based on\ndecision-making research that I've been\ndoing for 25 years we have to help teens\nweigh the benefits and the risk now I\ndon't mean that we say hey it's good for\nyou or you're going to like it certainly\nnot but if we only come from a risk\nmodel and a just say no model that never\nworks for teens we need to help them\nunderstand the\nbalance and and teens know that there\nare good things about using some drugs\nreal or perceived and we can't lie to\nthem on that so that gets to then how do\nwe have those messages and you're right\nif we only harp on and and our research\nwould show this too the long-term health\nrisks the your brain on on drugs those\nkinds of things that's so far in the\nfuture or the tra you know you're going\nto have a tra if you smoke but they're\nshowing the 80-year-old and no\n16-year-old even looks at somebody at\nthat age or cares about somebody that's\nso that other person that that's the\nproblem so we need to talk about the\nsocial aspects that teens really care\nabout you you may get wrinkles although\nwe don't know that so much with these\ncigarettes but um but the Athletics the\nthings that are important to\nteens now the campaigns that you're\ntalking about are really effective as\nwell particularly the mass Campaign\nwhich a level that we see social media\nCampaign which is do you realize that\nthe industry ecigarettes tobacco\nnicotine cigarette whatever you want to\ncall it is targeting you as a teenager\non purpose they want you as a smoker I\nused to go to middle school students and\nsay before eat cigarettes when\ncigarettes were of concern and I I love\nsaying to to young people 400,000 adults\nare dying each year from a cigarette\nfrom cigarette use you're a replacement\nsmoker and it was great cuz teen said we\nget really angry and say wait I this\n12-year-old boy was so cute wait I don't\nwant to be a replacement smoker Dr money\nwas a big deal to him and I I don't want\nto give money to the industry and it's\ngreat channel that energy and get young\npeople mad that's what really worked\nshowing that the Seven Dwarfs we call it\nthe seven CEOs of the to Big tobacco\ncompanies at the time said nicotine's\nnot addictive nicotine is not addictive\nthere our cigarettes are not addictive\nand that clearly they were lying to\nteens you show that to a teen and\nexplain how nicotine is addictive and\nthey knew it but they're trying to get\nyou works really well and and same thing\nwith marketing we we have a whole lesson\non marketing do you think that that that\ncandy was for me as an middle-aged adult\nit's for you and that gets the mad\nbecause they don't want to be duped they\ndon't want to be targeted that is a much\nbetter message now we still have to tell\nthem about the health risks we\nabsolutely do they still need the\nknowledge they still need to understand\nwhat they're doing is unhealthy but we\ncan't do it in a lecturing way and we\ncan't do it in a way that makes them\nfeel stupid we can't tell them their\nbrains are developing till 25 and\ntherefore they're dumb our lessons on\ntalking about brain are more like it's\nreally cool that you're developing it's\nwhy you can do dance that's why you can\nsing better you can learn language\nthere's so much that you could do that's\nreally cool that I can't do right now\nbut because of that that's why you're so\nmuch more likely to become addicted and\nthe industry knew that that's why\nthey're targeting you those are the\nmessages that work a lot better for\nteens sounds like the the key is to\nnever undervalue the spirit of defiance\nin youth yeah and perhaps to um wager it\num against these clearly destructive\nbehaviors to be honest I'm shocked that\num there's so much Vape use and\necigarette use I mean these numbers are\nstaggering yeah maybe we could weave in\na discussion about cannabis sure uh I\ndid an episode about can cannabis um the\nlandscape around cannabis has changed so\nmuch since I was a kid it was highly\nillegal at least where I grew up um now\nI think it's um been decriminalized\ncertain places still illegal elsewhere I\ndon't want anyone getting in trouble um\nas a consequence of not understanding\nwhat you know the laws in their area uh\nand outright legal pretty easy to get in\na lot of the country and um it's not\nclear that at least with individual use\nthat it's being um you know punished as\nfre nearly as frequently as it used to\nbe so the you know 10-word summary of of\nthe Cannabis thing is that the ratio of\nTHC to CBD is important it is true that\na lot of cannabis has much much higher\nlevels of THC now than in the past\nalthough I'm told that high THC level\ncannabis always existed um but it seemed\nseem to be the concentration of THC that\nis of let's just say concern as it\nrelates to the potential development of\npsychosis um if there's a\npredisposition um as in terms of the uh\nhow addictive the Cannabis is and so on\nand so forth which is not to say that\nCBD is totally innocuous but it seems to\nbe like the THC concentration is the\nkind of the thing that to mainly focus\non so what do we know about cannabis and\nhere we're going to assume cannabis with\na a reasonable to high level of THC in\nit so not pure CBD um what do we know\nabout vaping and EIG use of cannabis\nspecifically is it true that youth that\nare taking um nicotine by way of Vape or\necigarette then transition into using\ncannabis is it sort of a Gateway into\ncannabis use and how prevalent is\ncannabis use in kids age 10 to 21 first\nof all your right I mean THC levels\nwe're seeing today's joint is about 10\njoints when I was a te uh so the the\ndramatic increases in the potency right\nnow that we're seeing around THC and\nthen you get something like dabbing\nwhich is about 80% THC versus 20 to 30%\nof of the more mainstream products that\nwe have on the market when I say\nmainstream I mean like uh uh joints or\nor ecigarettes so the potency has gone\nup dramatically and it is of concern so\ndepending on the study you're going to\nsee anywhere from 10 to 20% of teens\nsaying that they're using some form of\ncannabis either smoked or in the form of\na joint or a blunt and for those who\ndon't know a blunt a lot of people don't\nrealize is a combination of both tobacco\nand cannabis so it's it's a cigar leaf\nor some people buy a cigar and pull out\nthe tobacco and put in the Cannabis or\nthey'll just get the cigar leaf and and\nroll the the cannabis flower then you're\ngetting both the kind of the double\nwhammy and the Chaser the high of both\nof nicotine and THC so we're seeing a\nfair number of it's interesting even\nthough teens are not smoking cigarettes\nthey're still using joints which is\ninteresting uh but very quickly\nincreasing is ecigarettes with cannabis\nin there you could buy a cannabis style\necigarettes and that's been around for a\nlong time with volcano vaporized and\nspecific cannabis vaporizers that's not\nnew but it's become much much more\npopular but now we're also seeing teens\nbuy a nicotine\necigarette inhale half of it and then\nadd the the cannabis wax or oil to it\nand then basically get the combination I\nhad one young young teenager probably\n123 14year old young man who said yeah I\nI got a cherry nicotine vape and I\ninhaled half of it probably use the word\ninhale but I used half of it and then I\nadded in some cannabis oil and now I had\na cherry flavored cannabis nicotine\ndevice so we're seeing that more and\nmore and even though you're not\ntechnically supposed to and the\nmanufacturers of nicotin cigarettes will\nsay don't open them and add stuff a\nsimple YouTube video will teach you how\nto do it um and unfortunately the videos\nare not using gloves and bedz zoic acid\nis coming your skin and things like that\nbut which is bad for which is does it go\ntransdermally does it go through the\nskin it supposedly it does yeah yeah if\nthe benzoic acid is going transdermally\npresumably when one inhales off one of\nthese pods they're also bringing benzoic\nacid into the lungs correct and um\nhopefully people realize this from our\nepisodes on breathing but if not I'll\njust make it clear now that when you\nbreathe in a substance you know a\nairborne substance into your lungs\nbecause of the um interface between the\nvasculature the blood supply and the\nlungs I mean basically things pass from\nthe lungs into the blood supply very\nvery readily quickly and then if those\nthings are able they'll cross the bloodb\nbrain barrier correct correct and it\nonly takes about 7 to 10 seconds to go\nthrough the whole system and into the\nbrain too so it's a very fast process so\nyes so teenagers are definitely uh\nvaping or using cannabis ecigarettes\nand the the problem is you know for one\nteasel think it's healthier than just\nlike nicotina cigarettes they think it's\nhealthier than combustible I mean yes\nyou're not burning it but you're still\ninhaling and you still are inhaling\nthere seems to be the purp and glycol\nthe glycerin the flavorant all the alahh\ntides even if it's just just a an\ncannabis ecigarette so there's a lot of\nconcern there and then addiction is\nstill huge it's a huge issue when you're\ntalking about cannabis the same reasons\nthat we talked about with nicotine the\nbrain development and so\non psychosis just a lot a lot to think\nabout here psychosis um there's actually\nsome scientists now who are really\nstrongly saying it's not associated as\ncausal that if you are predetermined to\nhave a mental health issue psychosis\nschizophrenia then it starting to use or\nusing cannabis can actually trigger and\ncause you to become psychotic um I don't\ntotally understand the mechanism yet I\ndon't think we totally do yet but that\nthere seems to be more than just it\nmight happen and it seems to be right in\nthat older adolescent young adult time\nframe that it is happening so around the\nsame time that the brain's developing um\nand we're hardwiring the rest of our\nbrain that that change is happening from\nfrom a neur neuronal connection\nperspective um my understanding sorry to\ninterrupt but my understanding is that\nindeed um\nthe use of high THC cannabis in youth in\nparticular male youth right predisposes\nand you're saying might even be causal\ntoward the development of psychotic\nsymptoms correct in late teens early 20s\ncorrect and that some of those cases um\nare ones in which the psychosis is\nirreversible correct um is it sometimes\nthe case that somebody exhibits\npsychotic symptoms as the consequence of\nusing\nTHC and The Psychotic symptoms resolve\nor is it you know some sort of circuit\nswitch that is then permanent you know\nit's a good question I honestly don't\nreally know the answer to that of what\nwhat percentage um the the few cases I\nknow of and in talking to the\npsychiatrist uh would say that it that\nit's causal and it may be permanent now\nit could be it could be managed it\ndoesn't mean that somebody's going to be\nhaving psychotic episodes all the time I\nmean certainly can be managed and\ncertainly we say please don't continue\nto use uh would be very important but\nwhether it's completely reversible is\nsomething that I'm not sure of uh\nsomebody more versed in this but we you\nknow what you do in in your research and\nwhat I know is you know changes to the\nto the neural circuitry is not\nchangeable you know when we hurt our uh\nbrain cells that is not something that\nwe could recover from so that is very\nmuch concerning yeah as an as adults\nthere are very few new neurons added to\nthe brain um um there is significant\nplasticity and recovery of function in\nsome cases both by virtue of traumatic\nbrain injury um certainly people can get\nover uh certain behavioral patterns and\nthat no doubt involves plasticity but it\nit takes work and um and when it comes\nto addiction uh there's evidence that\nsome of the reward circuitry can adjust\nbut um again it it takes um adherence to\nspecific things in order to make that\nhappen um I'm very concerned about this\nuh potentially causal relationship but\ncertainly correlation between high THC\ncontaining cannabis and psychosis mostly\nbecause we already have a serious\nproblem with psychosis on the planet a\nlot of people don't realize that you\nknow approximately 1% of the world's\npopulation has schizophrenia and by the\nway I have to be careful with the\nlanguage nowadays you know has\nschizophrenia or is schizophrenic or all\nthat that language gets murky but meet\nthe diagnostic criteria for\nschizophrenia I think is a safe way to\nput it um so if one is then adding to\nthat number of people exhibiting or and\nsuffering from psychotic symptoms that\nprevent them from having uh functional\nwork lives Etc that that's that's an\nissue um how difficult is it for these\nAdolescent and teens to quit vaping and\necigarettes and cannabis I mean um can\nthey quit just by deciding are there\nprograms are they all going into um you\nknow recovery programs are there\nrecovery programs in schools I mean how\nsuccessful are they in\nstopping it's really difficult and and\nmaybe I'll talk about nicotine first and\nthe same would be true for cannabis but\na little bit less extent I me both are\naddictive and interestingly not a lot of\npeople realize that cannabis is\naddictive and about one in six teens or\npeople who are using particularly under\nthe age of 25 do become addicted so they\ndon't realize that it's addictive they\ndon't realize it's addictive the\nargument I often heard was it's not as\nbad as alcohol which is a um kind of a\nlame argument I understand why people\ndefault to that but I mean getting hit\nby a car might not be as bad as getting\nhit by a train um but yeah I don't I\nwouldn't even look at that analogy as\naccurate there just different um levels\nof destructive different types of\ndestructive\num yeah these not as bad as\nblank doesn't really seem to to work no\nno and and you know I often say people\nsay well why' you start studying tobacco\nI mean there is no safe level of tobacco\nuse period yes we have very few\n30-year-olds who suddenly pick up a\ncigarette and become addicted you know\nat that point you you your development\nof your brain now can if you use regular\nLe are you still going to hurt your\nlungs and and heart and stuff like that\nabsolutely the brain changes may not be\nthere in the same way but most people\ndon't pick up a cigarette or a cigarette\nfor the very first time in their 30s or\n40s and and on so absolutely it's\naddictive and and it is probably the\nmost difficult to quit uh drug that's\nout there whereas alcohol we don't see I\nmean yes we have alcoholism I'm not\ndownplaying that it's a huge issue in\nthis country it's a huge issue on this\nplanet but you're not going to have\npeople in two weeks three weeks suddenly\nsay I'm addicted to alcohol you are\ngoing to with nicotine and you are with\ncannabis to some extent as well so yes\nuh nicotine is incredibly addictive and\nwe have so many teens who are addictive\naddicted to nicotine through ecigarettes\nand really struggling to get off of it I\ngave a talk recently to a group of\nparents and they said this is all great\ninformation Bonnie but how do I help my\nkid and I just felt awful because\nthere's not a lot that we have so taking\na few different things first of all we\ndon't have there are some programs there\nare inpatient programs absolutely\nshowing some some POS impatient program\nthere are actually some impatient\nprograms and but those are going to be\nexpensive or require that people have\ninsurance that will cover that\nabsolutely and they take weeks and then\nyou're taking a young person out of\ntheir natural environment out of their\nschool out of their friends stigmatizing\nwhich hopefully we're not stigmatizing\ndrug use anyway but you know you take a\nyoung person at 12 14 16 you put him in\nanother place that's very difficult on\nthem and if part of why they're using in\nthe first place is stress you're just\nenhancing\nthat outpatient programs we have some\nthings but the problem is we don't have\nthe best recommendations because we\ndon't have great research so for example\nnicotine replacement therapy the patch\nfirst of all it's not authorized for use\nby the FDA something it approved by the\nFDA for anybody under 18 and and yet we\nhave a lot of teenagers who are addicted\nwe just don't have the right studies and\nthey haven't gone to the FDA for that\napproval now a lot of doctors are using\nnicotine patches and prescribing them\nfor somebody under 18 it's considered\noff label but you still can do it and\nmost people would recommend it the the\nproblem is and and I don't mean problem\nwith using them I have no problem with\nand I've often suggested to I don't\ntreat I I want to make sure that I'm not\nmisquoted there either I don't directly\ntreat see patients myself but based on\nthe evidence and the American Academy\nPediatrics recommendations we should be\nusing a patch with those under 18 te but\nthen the question is how much if a\nnicotine patch is about 21 milligrams of\nnicotine and a teenager is using 40\nmilligrams in a day do you give two\npatches and I've had some doctors say\nwow that's a lot of nicotine I say Well\nthey're using a lot of\nnicotine what I've heard some uh my\nadolescent medicine colleagues have\nsuggested as one patch and then\nsupplement with gums and suckers and La\nAnders not as a starting I don't mean\nlike what we're seeing with with some uh\npouches out there like Zen as a starter\nI don't mean that I mean as a uh a form\nof treatment as a way to wean them off\nso reducing the dosage over time correct\ncorrect and and now but then they also\ndon't have the the hand to mouth piece\nthat we see that is difficult so gum in\nthis case I mean non- nicotine gum just\nchewing regular gum um I've heard\nteenagers say that they're that they're\nwithdraw last three to four minutes so\nthey have a one teenager said I have a\nplaylist on my phone that's each song is\nthree to four minutes and when I start\nto feel the withdrawal I pop the music\nin my ears and I go do something and I\nlisten to the song and by then that\nuncomfortable feeling is over I've heard\nteens say that they'll run that there's\nmany different things that they'll do um\nchewing on a toothpick not a nicotine\ntoothpick but just a toothpick um other\nways to really get their mind off of\nthat feeling is really important but we\nalso have to know with adults and\ncigarettes it can take 7 to 11 tries so\nwe can't expect until they're fully off\nof a cigarette can't expect a teenager\nto quit overnight especially with the\nsocial pressure and again sorry to\ninterrupt but I think the the 7 to1\ntries um did an episode on on nicotine\nand I talked about smoking a bit and\nmost people fail most people fail they\nrelapse it's very very difficult to quit\nsmoking people that do it and stick to\nit are real heroes of the process uh\nit's not not easy um\nbut that's with a heavy incentive you\nknow immediate health issues sometimes\nit's Financial um Etc with kids it feels\nlike all all the pressures are pushing\nin the opposite direction because it's\nsocially rewarded they get that you know\nelevation of mood and focus and there's\njust oh so much um driving them to you\nknow continue using absolutely right one\nof the things that we do in our program\nto help teens quit is we talk about\nsocial withdrawal and it was actually\none of our we have a wonderful group of\n40 youth who work with us we call our\nyouth action board our yab our reach lab\nyab uh our yabs say that we need to talk\nabout social withdrawal not just\nphysical because of exactly what you're\ntalking about they may not be able to go\nto that party at on a Saturday night\nwhere they know their friends are vaping\nbecause it'll and we know the brain cues\nup that they'll see or smell or or\nwitness somebody using an ecigarette and\nthose cues will happen and they'll want\nto use it so they actually have to\nisolate themselves from their friend\ngroup who was using so it's very\ndifficult so really setting up your\nsocial M you really setting up your\nfriends who are not using really trying\nto talk uh and and have your family\naround you and I really tell parents\nit's not the time to get pissed off with\nyour kids for using it's the time to\nreally help them let's be in this\ntogether and often I say the reason why\nthey're using isn't their fault let's go\nback to the beginning of our\nconversation about marketing and and\nthat they're being targeted and teens\ndidn't even know what was hitting them\nwhat was going on so let's not be mad at\nthem let's be sympathetic and help so\nthey need the combination of nicotine\nreplacement they needed to change their\nmilu they need to have healthy snacks\nand water and and exercise and all kinds\nof things around them and they may also\nneed cond behavioral therapy or some\nother therapy to really get them it's\nnot going to be a one stop we need to\nwork with them and that's the same with\ncannabis by the way this is just any\ndrugs and just feel so bad it is such a\nproblem right now when we built our\ncurriculums same thing I said I was\ndoing middle and high school and never\nthought I'd do elementary and we have an\nele curriculum I thought I was only\ngoing to do prevention we now have\nintervention and moving towards\nsensation that's how many young people\nare just struggling right now when I was\nin high school there seemed to be a\nphenomenon of you know certain behaviors\nallowed kids to have some social clout\num by virtue of I guess they used to\ncall it holding like if someone had weed\nor if somebody um yeah if they had weed\nthen sort of gave them a position in the\nsocial structure often times the um kids\nthat you know I mean I was friendly and\nknew most people in my high school class\num you know and a few of them were kind\nof like less socially engaged than\nothers but then at some point Midway\nthrough High School one of them was like\nstart showing up with weed at parties or\nsomething and suddenly like they had\nlike a social clout um it was kind of\ninteresting to see how you know having\nparaphernalia having nicotine or\ncannabis or whatever it is is sort of um\nI think has long been a kind of like an\ninstant um sort of uh route to inserting\noneself into a social structure which is\nobviously unhealthy I'm not I'm not\npromoting this yeah and then it is\nsocial right that there's a there's sort\nof an instant substrate for\ncommunication when I was growing up I\nworked at skateboard shop and on my\nbreak I would go behind the shop there's\na little alley there we'd skateboard\nthere's this little bump and but\noccasionally like um employees would\nshare a share a cigarette or you you'd\nask someone for a cigarette this this\nwas kind of a way of bridging social\ngaps um so again I I feel like it's so\nhard to be a teenager there's so much\ngoing on internally and externally and\neverything you're talking about you know\nin terms of the the negative health\neffects the paraphernalia the marketing\nThe Taste the addictive qualities of it\nEtc um just start to pile on on all\nthese these challenges to to staying\naway from it but a big one seems to be\nthe kind of instant um social cred that\none gets when they participate in\nsomething that other people are\nparticipating in because for instance\nlike a sport like if there's a pickup\nbasketball game you have to play\nreasonably well to get into get into the\ngame otherwise you're it's not going to\nbe easy or you have to be very bold yeah\nright um so unless you're engaged in a\nsport you're in theater or you're doing\nother things it it's sort of an instant\nroute\nokay I think I've made my point um is\nthere anything about that um that by way\nof understanding you know can help you\nknow create like replacement behaviors I\nmean it's going to be hard to take a kid\nwho's you know entire life is hanging\nout with their friends and vaping\ncannabis or nicotine after school and\nhanging around and playing on their\nphone and saying Hey listen you're going\nto quit vaping nicotine you're going to\nfeel worse your friends are all going to\nbe doing it and um you'll still be their\nfriend but you're not really part of it\nit's almost like you have to create a\nculture of quitting before this can\nreally go the other direction you do and\nand what you're saying is is so correct\nand so relevant and why I feel so bad\nfor teens right now and and and the\nsocial media right you put put that in\nthere as well and it's all over the\nplace right now with them they're\nbombarded by all of the different\nfactors that you talked about and it was\ninteresting we were talking about\nearlier around the social aspects too I\nwas thinking there was a point where it\nwas so cool particularly around Joel it\nwas so cool to jeel that I had teens\ncome up to me and say Dr Bonnie do you\nhave a fake ecigarette and I said a fake\necigarette well yeah all my friends are\nusing and I don't want to but I want to\nfake it and I just felt so bad and I\nsaid no I'm not going to get you a fake\ne cigarette but I will help you with\nrefusal skills and teach you how to say\nno but in this case not just say no but\nteach you how to feel good about about\nsaying no to certain things that you\ndon't want to be\ndoing and during that time there was it\nwas very difficult for teens to come up\nand say I either want to quit or I don't\nwant to be a user I just don't want to\nstart because that was not cool I think\nwe changed in the last couple years\nthankfully I think there are more teens\nwho are not using who are open to it or\nwho open to quitting a lot of teens want\nto quit right now so thankfully we're in\na new era where this yes the pressures\nto use are absolutely there but there's\nstarting to be a tide change where we\ngetting more teens who are getting on\nthe so-called bandwagon to either quit\nor not use I think the social supports\nare being there a lot more than we've\never seen before we have more youth\ngroups who are getting on board of\neither trying to help quit or trying to\nmake sure that it's okay not to use um\nit's still hard and what you're talking\nabout so it's our job as adults and\nhealthc care providers and Community\nPartners and Educators to really talk to\nyoung people to set up those social\ngroups and say it's okay not to use it's\nokay to come on over to this group and\nyeah maybe you're not going to be with\nthat same social group on Saturday night\nlet's start a new social group for you\nI'm not saying it's easy this is not\neasy for young people and it's not easy\nparents are struggling too they're\nstruggling to know what how to talk to\ntheir teenagers but this is what we have\nto work towards and setting up those\nsocial networks of it's cool not to\nuse one of the other things by the way\nthat we talk talk about is the\nenvironment when we talk to teens about\nnot using and why why it's bad for them\nheart lungs Etc and all the things and\nbeing duped and being marketed to and\nand the money the environment piece has\nalso been interesting you know teens\nright now may not care about their\nhearts their lungs 20 years from now\nthey care about the environment and\nthere are environmental aspects to these\nthe Plastics the the pods don't\ndisappear the benzoic acid does not\nevaporate and and we've got secondhand\nVapor secondhand smoke secondhand and\nthird hand so what I mean by that is if\nI were to use any ecigarette near you\nyou would actually get a lot of the\nvolatile organic chemicals a lot of the\nnicotine is in the air actually some\nstays suggest covid might even be on\nthose droplets there's a lot of issues\nthere and then third hand is it just\ndoesn't dissipate that Vapor aerosol\nit's not a vapor that Aeros so then\nsettles into carpets and and clothes and\nso on and this is toxic to pets to\nChildren things like that so we talk to\nteens about that that's another way to\nget young people to be willing to either\nquit or to Rally around not using is the\nenvironment know I if I wash dishes for\ntoo long and my my younger was out of\nthe house but when when she comes over I\nget yelled across the room mom turn the\nwater off the environment we have to\nsave water that's what they care about\nso much that if we could at least get\nthat into young people's hands say you\nknow what you may not care about\nyourself but what about your friends and\nwhat about the environment I think we\ncan also shift some of the generation\nright now interesting yeah I think\nreplacement behaviors concerned for the\nenvironment seem like good incentives\nand I'm hearing all this I feel really\nlucky that I was always obsessed with\nsomething growing up whether or not it\nwas like birds and fish tanks or\nskateboard or prior to that soccer or\nyou know um I mean certainly there were\ndrugs and alcohol around but there was\nthere were always activities that kept\nus busy um and I guess I wonder whether\nor not the Advent of social media has\ncreated less interest in activities I\nyou know after school activities I guess\nthey used to call them but um I mean\neven if it's video games um if it's\nplaying a sport if it's theater if it's\num art if it's music uh presumably kids\nare still doing all that stuff but is it\nthe case that the kids that are vaping\nlet's say nicotine maybe cannabis as\nwell are less likely to be engaged in\nother activities I mean is this thing\nbecoming just kind of a closed loop of\nreward I mean that that's to me the real\ndanger of any substance that um\nincreases the dopamine system activation\nwithout a lot of effort right because\nthe as you and I know that the the whole\nof dopamine circuitry as it relates to\nreward is all about effort reward\nreinforcement effort reward\nreinforcement um but the effort piece is\nkey and drugs basically bypass the\neffort piece and then you get the reward\nreinforcement and then eventually the\nrewarding and reinforcing levels of of\nreturn on that drug nicotine cannabis\nEtc diminishes and then you're just\ncaught in a behavioral Loop right right\nright absolutely um so you know are kids\ndoing less stuff are they are they\nstudying less as a consequence of this\nare they are they playing fewer sports\nare they less engaged in youth theater\nand music and youth groups and things\nlike that when we were talking about\ncigarettes when I first started my\ncareer up until probably 2014 I would\nsay yes you're absolutely correct and it\nwas generally the teens who would say\nI'm bored and I didn't know what to do\nwith myself and that's why I picked up\ncigarettes or um or I'm not an athlete\nor or this was my social\noutlet I haven't seen that as a result\nas much with ecigarettes now as a result\nof ecigarettes yes but not as a cause of\nusing because it's so ubiquitous\necigarettes we're seeing everywhere it\ndoesn't matter if you're how old you are\nmale female used to be more males using\nbecause some of the earlier devices were\nmore Tech and guys were using it and\nsome of the females didn't want to put\nthem in their person because they would\nleak we now are seeing more of an equal\nif not a little bit more female using um\nit's it's not your so-called bad or good\nkids it's not anything it's not the\nyoung people who are struggling with\nschool it's everywhere right now\nindependent of location race ethnicity\nthings like that so I don't see so much\nwhat you're talking about in terms of a\npredictor in terms of a of a result\nabsolutely I mean then we're seeing\nteens who become more isolated who are\nnot engaged as much who are more bored\nbecause they're sitting home and they're\nvaping um but I also see a lot of young\npeople sitting around together vaping uh\nso I I do think that that landscape has\nchanged um is it going to change back I\ndon't know is hopefully we change the\nculture again uh but it it's an\ninteresting thought I mean as soon as\nyou said that I was thinking yeah I mean\nthey're certainly not out as much as\nthey used to be in terms of and we're\ntalking about this at the beginning\nwe're not seeing them out in Parks as\nmuch we're not seeing them playing\npickup sports games as much as we used\nto but I don't think that's because of\necigarette use I think that's because of\nsocial media and just the whole change\nand honestly parents being afraid of\nletting their kids out for some\npredatory behavior and in other ways um\nand you mean if kids are let out of the\nhouse they're more at risk to predatory\nbehavior but of course they're also at\nrisk when but just by use of the phone\nbecause the phone connects everywhere\nabsolutely the phone connects everywhere\nand that's something we try to teach\nteens as well but I think that that's\nbeen something that parents are worried\nabout you know I have to you almost the\npendulum almost swung too much of now I\nhave to keep my kid in because I don't\nwant to let them out of the house and I\ndon't want to let them alone driving and\nalone at the park and things like that\nbut I think that we've reduced you were\ntalking earlier about autonomy we've\nreduced teens just autonomy and they\nthey have to get into a little bit of\ntrouble they have to jwalk they have to\ndo I mean I'm not encouraging but you\nknow but but we there's some natural\namount of getting together and hanging\nout and being crazy at the park and\nplaying and playing games and things\nlike that and I think that has stopped\nor or slowed down a lot uh I I see it\nwith with some people in my own\nCommunity I don't see as much just\nhanging out in the front yard and\nshooting the breeze and instead they're\nthey're inside and they're on their\nphones and and stuff like that so could\nthat be part of why we're seeing more\necigarette use possibly I just don't\nhaven't I haven't seen the studies on it\nyeah perhaps that's a good segue into\nrisky behaviors when I was a kid I mean\nthe dumb stuff that we did um meaning\ndumb because it was dangerous to\nourselves I mean I am not suggesting\npeople do this kids please don't do this\njust don't but just the dumb stuff of\nyou know jumping off roofs or between\nroofs\num I'm not going to give any other uh\nany anecdotes just uh it's amazing that\nwe all survived um and and some didn't\nbut that was largely the consequence of\ndrugs alcohol mental health issues of\nkids I knew um but car accidents um\nactually I grew up in the uh in the\nmother's Against Drunk Driving era and\nthere was a there real\ndiscouragement around drunk driving I\nwas fortunate that at least in high\nschool most of my friends didn't drink\nor didn't drink much um but you still\nheard about fatalities kids happen um\neven one is is too many obviously um\nwhat's going on now in terms of\nrisk-taking behavior um driving fast\ndriving drunk um doing what used to be\njust described as dumb stuff um that\nunfortunately sometimes is is fatal or\nyou know results in paralysis people\njumping off bridges into water without\ntesting the water depth you know we've\nall heard the stories and sadly um they\ntrue stories of people becoming\nparalyzed that kind of thing dumb stuff\ndangerous stuff teens do more of it um\nis it still true that males are doing\nmore of that physical danger stuff than\nthan um than females or is that not true\nthat's what we used to hear but then of\ncourse there's been this big push\nimportantly really to um balance out the\namount of research on on both\nsexes yeah it's a good point I mean some\nof it has to do with just the methods of\nour research to know you know what's\ninteresting I haven't seen more recent\ndata in terms of differences by sex of\nof risk engagement and risk behavior I\nmean a lot of what I've seen is balanced\nout I think it's maybe different kinds\nof risk behaviors that that people do\nbut we're still seeing it I we're still\nseeing teens drinking we're still seeing\nteens going to parties and getting drunk\nwe're still seeing teens out on the\nbeach and getting drunk I think the big\ndifference now is whether from Mothers\nAgainst now I think it's destructive\ndriving is that what it's called I think\nit's now mothers destructive driving I\nthink that's so that includes drunk\ndriving and racing and racing and and\ndriving under the influence of cannabis\nor anything else which can be harmful\nbut at least in in a lot of the teens\nand young adults I've talked to at least\nwe've gotten that word out to teens so\nthey're still drinking and they're still\ndoing stupid stuff when they drink but\nthey're not getting behind the wheel as\nmuch um much less and this idea of a\ndesignated driver or sober driver um\nUber or Uber Uber's really I guess or\nlift or any R shair let's just say any\nride share has certainly been uh a game\nCher in in in the landscape of teenagers\nand young adults right now uh and in\nfact I've heard not just a designated\ndriver but a designated partner or a\nsober a sober sitter so this idea that\nyou go to a part party and there may be\ndrinking going on but you make sure that\nthere's one person who's sober not just\nfor driving but to make sure you're not\ngoing home with somebody you don't want\nto go home with to make sure that you're\nnot leaving drunk and falling downstairs\nto make sure that you're not falling out\nof that window so that message we've\ngotten across really well which I'm\nthrilled about are we still seeing drunk\ndriving in accidents I certainly have\namong some people I know certainly we\nare but I think that the message overall\nis gten out there some people I've\ntalked to said we just just don't get\nbehind the wheel period what's also\ninteresting is more and more teens are\nnot driving they're delaying driving\nmore and more whether that's because of\nuber lift I mean it's it's as a parent\nit's less expensive to pay for a ride\nshare than to pay for insurance for\nsomebody under 25 or to pay for a car so\ncertainly that might be it um but but\nthat is there doing other stupid stuff I\nmean in addition to drugs jumping\nskateboarding certainly we're still\nseeing that well skateboarding is a good\nsport you got to don't exceed your skill\nlevel but jumping between buildings not\nsmart um unless you're super skilled and\nknow what you're doing I mean you know\nthere are the parkour kids and the\nskateboard kids and in the BMX cuz we we\ndon't want to take away what the\nincredible things that they can can do\nbut but there's risk there right I was\nreferring to people who lack the skill\nto to complete the to complete the\nmaneuver and um and getting badly hurt\nor or in some cases not getting badly\nhurt but you you just kind of shake your\nhead and wonder why you why you ever\nengaged in that kind of stuff just so\nrisky yeah yeah we're definitely still\nseeing risk behavior amongst teenagers\nand part of it has to do with\nimpulsivity we know that teens's up\nuntil around part of the development\nright of cognitive and social\npsychosocial and Social Development it's\nup until around 16 17 they're still very\nimpulsive uh we know with the brain\ndevelopment right the back of the brain\ndevelops f faster and first and that's\nour amydala our emotional Center our\nmotor coordination versus the front of\nthe brain which is our executive\nfunctioning our uh uh planning for the\nfuture our really slowing down and being\nable to think of the risks and benefits\nand make those decisions a little slower\nand a little bit better more like we\nwould as adults so we certainly see\nimpulsive decision you know hey let's go\nteepee that house or let's go ride on\nthat car or let's go do things that\nprobably hopefully wouldn't get them\nkilled or injured but may get them\nbusted in other ways we're still seeing\nthat I think there have been more\nprograms to help teens sort of rehearse\nin in situations so they're not more\nlife skills training so they're not\nmaking some of those impulsive decisions\nbut teens will teens are going to be\nteens which by the way is why we don't\nput things in front of them like you\nknow sugar booger and unicorn kind of\nmarketing that's going to get te\nattractive because that is buying into\nthat knee-jerk impulsive it looks cool\neveryone's doing a kind of thing that\nthey can resist I don't mean that they\ncan't but just buys right into teens are\ngoing to be teens and that's what\nthey're going to\ndo um what about sexual behavior you\nmentioned that kids are driving less um\nor getting their driver's license less\nfrequently um which by the way with\nrespect\nto teens wanting to drive less that just\nlike baffles my mind I mean one of the\nreasons I like skateboarding as a sport\nis you could do it anywhere it was also\ntransportation and I like the social\nmilu I loved the social milu of it um\nand but getting my driver's license was\nlike one of the most important events of\nmy life me too I could drive to yede in\nthe summer I could do all sorts of\nthings with that I'm so surprised that\nkids wouldn't want to do that um such\nautonomy there so much fun um oh I I\nagree but I've also heard that um rates\nof of sexual behavior are going down is\nthat true yeah stabilizing and going\ndown um and certainly rates of risky\nsexual behavior has also gone down so we\nare getting the message across around\ncondom use around um STI testing around\nbirth control things like that which is\nalso really good but rates overall have\ngone down is teen pregnancy down I think\nit's down actually I haven't looked at\nthe latest numbers I think it's down uh\ncertainly I don't think has gone up but\nI'm I actually would need to look back\nat those numbers it's been a little\nwhile since I've looked at them and is\nwhat we're talking about um today mostly\nwithin the United States and the United\nStates alone or is it carry over to\nother countries as well so it it totally\ndepends on the behavior that we're\ntalking about let's say vaping um or E\nuse of cannabis uh or nicotine so\ninterestingly ecigarette nicotine\necigarette use has not been as high in a\nlot of other countries it depends on the\ncountry but for example the UK or Europe\nwe haven't seen the rates as high in the\nlast few years part of it was that a lot\nof other states have a nicotine standard\nso that means a minimum amount or\nmaximum amount excuse me of nicotine\nthat you're allowed to have so for\nexample the UK I think it's around\n1.7% in the US we have no nicotine\nstandard which is another major issue\nwith regulation we don't have we have as\nI was saying 5% 10% nicotine s there is\nno regulation about how much nicotine\nthat you could have so in certain\ncountries if it's right around the\naddictive level or a little bit below it\nwe're going to see fewer teens becoming\naddictive it's still bad at any amount\nbut we're going to see fewer people\nbecoming addicted the other is the\nmarketing was not as big in other\ncountries and really was the marketing\nwas ecigarettes if you're trying to stop\nsmoking cigarettes not marketed to teens\nthat has changed in the last year or two\nso in countries I've talked to for\nexample the UK I've been interviewed by\nthem many times in the last few years\nand they would say we don't have the\nsame problem and now they're saying boy\nwe are seeing a pretty significant\nincrease in the number of teens who are\nusing part of it is a different\nlandscape of the kind of ecigarette\nthat's out there the kind of marketing\nthat's out there whatever it is we are\nnow seeing is it as high as we have in\nthe US I don't think so but it's\ncertainly increasing same thing in in\nother countries where they actually\ndidn't allow certain ecigarettes to be\non the market have now come in and and\nbeen on the market and infiltrated and\neven in this country certain ecigarettes\nare illegal and they're coming in um\nillegally through illicit trading is\nhappening in and and crossing the\nborders so um so ecigarette we're still\nseeing cannabis depends on this on the\ncountry right whether it's legal or not\nnow even in the US I should say even\nstates that have legalized cannabis you\nhave to be 21 uh but we're still seeing\nunderage cannabis use of course just\nlike we're seeing underage drinking and\nunderage nicotin use in other states\nwhere it's just really difficult to get\nwe're not seeing cannabis as much but we\nstill are seeing\nit we didn't talk about um things like\nZin pouches which are becoming more\npopular with adults as well so no vaping\nno EIG no smoking nicotine but a little\npouch um which is different than dipping\ntobacco or snuffing tobacco um as far as\nI\nknow uh Zin pouches and things similar\ndeliver nicotine into the bloodstream\nwhich then crosses the bloodb brain\nbarrier goes into the brain has this\neffect of creating focus and alertness\nkind of little High um but doesn't carry\nthe same carcinogenic risk but\npresumably there are other risks um\nwhich include of course the add and\nhabit forming nature of it the blood\npressure increase the Vaso constriction\nwhich is related to the blood pressure\nEtc but what do we know about Zen pouch\nuse is it on the rise or um is or is it\nthat there's something so compelling\nabout vaping and um eigs that you know\npeople in particular kids want the the\nphysical act of of vaping so um this is\na case where I've seen this one other\ntime where actually the popular press is\nahead of the scientific press and\nprobably head of the science and\nteaching us scientists that we better\nhurry up and figure this out how was how\nwas that um so the popular press has\nbeen talking about Zin a lot and and\narguing that it's a very popular product\nand that we're seeing now this is true\nwe're seeing a very sharp increase in\nthe market share of Zin compared to\nother nicotine products so we're seeing\nit on the rise what I mean by science\nhasn't caught up is we don't have a lot\nof surveillance data to show whether or\nnot teens are actually using Zin we have\nsome data we actually published this\nstudy a couple years ago showing around\n20 to 25% of people in general\nadolescence and adults and about 11 to\n15% of teens are using a pouch\npresumably Zin we didn't ask we now we\nlooking at our data around Zen use um\nbut we don't have widescale studies we\ndo have studies of pouches more\ngenerally like the CDC showed that about\nI think it was a couple of percent one\nand a half percent and that it went up a\nlittle bit so I think I can't it was\nsomething like I think it went from one\n1.1% to about\n1.5% of teens seem to be admitting using\npouches so not a huge increase but a few\nhundred thousand teens are using across\nthe country as opposed to 2 and A5\nmillion plus using ecigarettes\nbut with all those qualifications aside\nyes we are seeing an increase in Zin use\namongst\nteenagers what's most concerning is that\nit seems like it's teenagers who are not\nusing it in addition to ecigarettes but\nnew initiates so they're now just like\nI'm concerned about teens initiating\ntobacco or nicotine through ecigarettes\nnow it seems like some are initiating\nthrough Zen so Zen is kind of the\nGateway it may be an onramp um to using\nand and and the idea is that they're\nputting it in between their lip and\ntheir gum and then each pouch of Zin is\nthree or 6 milligram it comes in a 3 MGR\npouch or a 6 MGR pouch now it is\nnicotine that yes it's originally D\nderived from tobacco but there's no\ntobacco in the pouch itself it's a white\npowdered\nnicotine and the I don't know what else\nis in there we are really lacking the\nresearch there but my concern is we've\nseen this with smokeless tobacco for\nyears is oral cancer and you're putting\nthis in the mouth and at the mucosal\nline and are we going to start being\nconcerned about oral cancer which we've\nalready been concerned about with other\npouches how would you get oral cancer if\nthere if there's no tobacco and it's\njust nicotine does nicot I I was under\nthe impression and please tell me if I'm\nwrong that nicotine itself doesn't cause\ncancer the question is what else is in\nthere is it just nicotine or is there\naldhy and other chemicals that are cut\nwith it so that's why I'm said we don't\nknow enough about it my big concern is\nexactly what you're saying are we going\nto start seeing teens using nicotine and\nthen nicotine pouches and moving\non but the the brain piece it doesn't\nmatter what else is in there we are\nstill concerned about the brain\ndevelopment and if you're using a 3\nmgram or a 6 milligram pouch and we know\nthat a lot of teens are using multiple\npouches our study showed this as well\nmultiple pouches throughout the day and\nactually some social media is showing\nteens putting in several pouches at the\nsame time then you might be getting\nagain as much as a pack of cigarettes of\nnicotine and that's very concerning so\nthe whole piece we talked about before\nabout brain development and are we\nstuning or changing or or really\nrewiring the brain with nicotine doesn't\nmatter what form it's in it is not good\nand it's not good for\nteenagers yeah I get asked a lot of\nquestions about Zen pouches and other\nnicotine pouches and one of the more\ncommon questions is um related to the\nfact that a lot of people start with one\nor two pouches a day quickly move to\nfour to five and the typical ceiling for\nmost people that at least ask me\nquestions about it uh is moving to\nquickly a canister a day yeah which is a\nlot of pouches uh I think it's 15 to 20\npouches per can okay so 3 to six\nmilligrams right you can do the math do\nthe math what's that 60 to upwards of 60\nmilligrams that's that's and I'm\nthinking back three packs of cigarettes\nyou got your step ahead of me two steps\nahead of me two let's play it safe two\nI'll give you you know two packs of\ncigarettes day at least two packs of\ncigarettes worth of nicotine and it's\ninteresting in in the in the old days\nwhen we didn't have e cigarettes and we\nwere talking about cigarettes and we\nwere talking about adults we would talk\npack cigarett years right how many packs\nof cigarettes and for how many years and\nthat language kind of reduced for a\nwhile because adults and people weren't\nusing cigarettes as much and so we\nweren't worrying about this concept of\npacks I'm worried about it again again\nwe're getting so much nicotine now now\nyes not in the form of combusted not in\nthe form of burning maybe it's in the\nform of ecigarettes or pouches but it's\nstill a huge amount of nicotine that\nwe're seeing that young very young\nbrains are using yeah can't be good in\nmy opinion I spent years studying brain\ndevelopment still teach brain\ndevelopment every year can't be good the\nbrain doesn't do well\ndeveloping with high artificially high\nlevels of any neuromodulator and then\nyou go back to the 8-year-olds we were\ntalking about earlier and we have no\nstudies right on what does a drug like\nnicotine do to not a teen brain but a\nchild brain and clearly is not good but\nwhat exactly is happening we don't have\nthose studies but it's it's incredibly\nscary to to think about what's happening\nwith young people um and getting\naddicted so young and then continuing\nthat addiction of a lifetime of\naddiction that they might\nhave seems like it would be appropriate\nnow to kind of take a step back um I\nthink everyone agrees that these are\nmajor problems that are in our youth um\nand just evaluate messaging and tools to\novercome uh these issues um right so\nobviously if you never try a substance\nor behavior you can't get addicted to it\num but given the prevalence of this\nstuff\nwhat sorts of messaging work earlier we\ntalked about set you know accessing the\nthe rebellious spirit that is youth as a\nway to get um youth to engage in\nhealthier behaviors and abandon\nunhealthy behaviors but there's quitting\nthere's just saying no and then there's\nharm\nreduction um\nthere's convincing people that some\nsubstance is bad for them and scaring\nthem to the point where they quit\nthere's incentivized in them to be\nhealthy there's um replacement behaviors\nthere's just so much in that landscape I\nknow you just um held a conference on\ncannabis and tobacco recently I'm sorry\nI wasn't able to attend it sounds super\ninteresting but whether or not we're\ntalking about social media or cannabis\nor risky driving behavior or um you know\nReckless Behavior of any kind I mean\nwhat works and when I say this I don't\nnecessarily just mean at the level of\nPublic Health discourse but also parent\nto child um peer to peer yeah um sibling\nto Sibling what works I mean how should\none approach a kid or an adult for that\nmatter who's vaping cannabis or is\nvaping nicotine at uh and it's just\nclearly going to be a bad trajectory\nwhat can one do I mean we all also\nunderstand personal accountability and\nneuroplasticity generally emerges best\nwhen it comes from within as opposed to\nfrom the outside but what can we do the\nmost important is and I've said this for\nyears have a\nconversation and some people think that\nhaving a conversation about name your\nname your risk behavior drugs uh of any\nsort Alcohol Tobacco other drugs having\na conversation about sex having a\nconversation about risky driving get\nyoung people curious that is not at all\nthe case there's nothing we can talk to\na young person about that they don't\nalready know you know we're kidding\nourselves to say oh we can't mention\ndrugs to a 16-year-old because we're\ngoing to get them curious they've known\nabout drugs since they were 8 years old\nthey we're not and and I often say to\nparents start that conversation Young\nwhen you're when your kids are really\nyoung four or five maybe the\nconversation is having a cookie or\nhaving some grapes and and make or going\nto bed now or going to bed in five\nminutes I used to say that with my own\nkids you want to go to bed now or in\nfive minutes so they felt like they were\nmaking the decision I didn't really care\nwhich decision they were making it was\nnot a fight we need to start having\nconversations around decision making and\nhealthy decision making and not having a\nconfrontation but a\nconversation very young now I'm not\nsaying that we talk about drugs or sex\nwhen they're very young although to be\nhonest I did I talked about cigarettes\nand and um and pubal development with my\nkids when they were very young but it\nbut just starting that conversation so\nthat when you move into more sensitive\ntopics more difficult topics as a child\nages and becomes an old older child and\ninto adolescence it's not shocking that\nyou're having those conversations and\nthis is whether you're a parent an\neducator or whatever so just talking a\nconversation and not scheduling it by\nthe way not on Saturday at 3:00 we're\ngoing to sit down and talk about sex or\n3 o' we're going to talk about drugs\nthat does not work you need to I I joke\nthat was like the queen of organic\nconversation you know I'd see something\non TV oh you know oh let's have a\nconversation about that just making it a\nnatural part and you were asking about\ndifferences in cultures and and\ncountries we don't normalize those\nconversations other countries do and we\nneed to be doing that so that's it\nsounds like we don't normalize them or\nformalize them correct we don't so\nthat's one thing the other is we're\nkidding ourselves if we just talk about\nthe just say no as we're saying before\nof course we want no use of course we\nwant teens to wait I mean and say we\nhope and expect that most people if not\nall will grow up into a healthy sexual\nrelationship whatever that might look\nlike even a healthy alcohol relationship\na glass of wine or half a glass of wine\nat night with dinner again no safe use\nof a lot of the other drugs including\nnicotine certainly fentanyl illicit\nfentanyl um want to make clear not all\nfanol mid elicit fentanyl but to just\nsimply say no and don't do and it's bad\nfor for you is setting up again that\nfailure of your conversation because\nokay well you're telling me it's bad but\nI liked it or my friend liked it and\nit's not so bad so you've lost\ncredibility the most important part of\nharm reduction is not to do it\nabsolutely of course not to use not to\nhave risky sex maybe not to have sex at\nall until you're older not to use\ntobacco not to use any drugs but how do\nwe do that with a young person who you\ngo into a classroom and 10% 20% have\nalready started using or having sex or\nwhatever the conversation is you shut\nthem down well they don't understand me\nso why should I listen to them they're\nnot talking to me and so that no use\nconversation doesn't work there's a\nContinuum or spectrum of use everything\nfrom no use to once in a while to\nregular use all the way up to addicted\nyears when we're talking about\ndrugs so to go in and assume that\nnobody's ever used or nobody wants to\nuse you're setting yourself up for\nfailure that's the expectation that's\nthe hope but what we really also need to\ntalk about is best if you don't use but\nif you do let's if you are using Let's\nhelp you cut back or quit and if you are\ncontinuing to use let's keep you safe\nlet's make sure that you're not going to\ndie and what I'm talking about here is\nyou know when when most parents if their\nkids are going to go to a party well I\nshouldn't say most parents but a\nconversation often is hey I hope you're\nnot drinking but if you are pick up the\nphone and I will come get you that's\nharm reduction and people oh I didn't\nthink about that well that's putting\nSafety First that is a harm reduction\nmessage o or saying I you know you're\npretty young to start having sex but\nhere's a condom just in case why do we\nschools have condoms and because they\nknow that as much as we say it's best to\ndelay are going to that's harm reduction\nlet's at least reduce risk of sti's\npregnancy and so on and what did the\ndata say is um the consequence of harm\nreduction versus the um kind of like\nthick black line don't don't go anywhere\nnear this behavior all the research or\npretty much all the research that I've\nread and hopefully will contribute to\nshows that that those messages the harm\nreduction messages um or what I would\nsay comprehensive really the harm\nreduction unfortunately harm reduction\nhas gotten a bad WP um part because of\ncigarettes versus ecigarettes and this\nreduction or harm Continuum with tobacco\nso maybe we don't say harm reduction we\nsay comprehensive conversations\ncomprehensive education from no use all\nthe way up to what do we do if you are\nusing and all the research is really\nsaying that those messages are way more\neffective than not using it all than\nthat if we tell teens don't use and we\nsee this a lot in sexual behavior we say\ndo not have sex period sign a contract\nthat you're not going to have sex and\nthen they're in a situation and we don't\narm them with the understanding of how\nto negotiate how to have a healthy\nrelationship had to have a conversation\nwhat do they do if they're thinking that\nthey might want to have sex what do they\ndo in that situation we then find that\nwe're having teens who then don't know\nhow to protect themselves and either\nhave sex that was unwanted or sex that\nwas\nunprotected and teens want to understand\nthey want the truth they want the\nknowledge I I went to a school and asked\nwhether if I came and talked about\ncannabis would they come and they said\nabsolutely I want to understand it and\nthere's this great quote that I recently\nlearned um that said if you know if you\ndon't basically the concept is if you\ndon't teach teens they're going to seek\nout information so the quote is having\nteens learn about sex from porn is like\nhaving them learn physics from a\nTransformer from the Transformers or\nhaving them learn how to drive from Fast\nand Furious We need to give teens the\ninformation because they're going to\nfind it that's right they're being\nexposed to other information\nelsewhere um anyway so that so what\nyou're talking about here is um coming\nup with counterbalances counterbalances\nreal science-based information that's\nnot overblowing the risks that's not\nscaring them and then that helps them\nunderstand it's best to say no but if\nyou do Fentanyl let's make sure you're\nnot using a loan I mean obviously I\ndon't want somebody using a drug that\nhasn't been tested and they got off the\nthe internet period because I know kids\nwho have died it's so scary you know we\nhave close friends that um gosh I I\nwould have never guessed that their kids\nwere using drugs and M maybe they were\nusing drugs at the frequency that was\nalways typical\nof of Youth I don't know I don't know\nthe situations well enough but you know\nI would say about once every four sadly\nonce every um 4 to 8 months I hear about\nsomeone's kid or close relative that\ndied of a fentanyl overdose yeah it does\nseem to be kids um maybe 30 and younger\nyeah it was more in the the 20s and 30s\nit's now really getting into the teens\nand young adults you're absolutely right\nand some of the teens I know of who and\nand young adults who have died were not\nyour drug users you know we talked about\nnot stigmatizing\nand and that's the other thing if we\ndon't talk then we're stigmatizing we\nneed to have those conversations but a\nlot of those teens were not using they\nthey needed a pill cuz they were in pain\nor they needed something and they were\nnot told and this is again that harm\nreduction and that conversation they\nwere not told don't buy something off\nthe internet if you do test it and and\nand test it with a fentanyl strip for\nexample and make sure that you're not\nusing a loan because if you're using a\nloan we can't then give you an our can\nwe can't do something I care AR cam with\nme all the time do you really I do I\nhave it in my backpack all the time for\nanyone that you might see that having an\noverdose or anyone who might see yeah\nthankfully it hasn't happened but if if\nif it does I would and and you can't\nhurt somebody from using it if that's\nsomething's happening so should everyone\ncarry a naram I think everybody should\nhave Naran I I do I think I think every\nschool should have Naran I think every\nLibrary should have Naran I think every\nbar should have Aron um I I absolutely\nbelieve it now test strips is an\ninteresting debate that I've had so I\ntotally believe in this concept of\ncomprehensive if you don't want to say\nharod action comprehensive drug\neducation comprehensive sex education\nand what I mean by that is both the\nspectrum of of use or behavior as well\nas all kinds of drug sex rock and roll\nthat we talk about the whole thing but\nFAL test strips has been an interesting\ndilemma Within Myself and I'll explain\nwhy\nI've been working with some groups to\ntry to test whether we could study\nwhether if we put both Naran and\nFentanyl test trips in schools would\nteens you get them so you're my fantasy\nbowl of condoms bowl of Naran bow of\nfenal test stps and you have it out for\nfor teens wow that's that's a bold\nstatement it is a very bold statement\nwhat about the argument that I imagine\nsome people uh counter with um I'm not\nnecessarily saying this this is my\nargument but just um imagining that some\npeople will hear that and say um having\nthose things uh visible freely available\nwill in will create more of an incentive\nfor risk-taking so I've grappled with\nthat and with condoms we know that\nthat's not the case T it's not going to\ncreate teens starting to have sex just\ngoing back to what we saying a few\nminutes ago you're not going to\nincentivize or create people engaging in\nany risk behavior by having the\nconversation but my Gra with the Naran\nand with the fentanyl test trips has\nbeen there oh well you tell me it's a\nbad idea to use a drug but I'll just\ntest it make sure it's okay well I have\na couple of problems with that um even\nthough I still believe in it I still\nbelieve in having those there because\nright now we have an overdose epidemic\nwith fentanyl and Other\nDrugs so I'll be honest with you I\ngrapple if if if I were in a school and\nI saw a teenager taking a fentanyl test\nstrip which probably means that they're\nuse it for themselves is the first thing\nI want to do shake the kid and say are\nyou crazy don't that means that you're\nthinking about using drugs of course\nthat's my inclination as a parent as a\nscientist as a developmental\npsychologist as a human being you want\nto say what are you doing so yes I would\ngrapple but at the same time if I know\nthat there's a chance that a teen's\ngoing to go to a party or pick up a drug\nand not know do I would I rather that\nthey're safe yes the problem with fental\ntest stps though is that they're not\nperfect if you are testing the right\nside of the pill but it's the left side\nthat has fentanyl you still could die\nand so I don't want to give the\nimpression that that there's one stop is\ngoing to fix anything right now it is\nnot and that that is the the issue with\nthe comprehensive drug education or harm\nreduction uh conversations I'm not\nsaying that it's perfect I'm not saying\nsaying that it's going to stop young\npeople from engaging or young people\nfrom from getting hurt or or you know\nunfortunately dying but if you have a\ngroup of Youth who are going to use I\nwould still rather arm them with that\ninformation so they don't find\nthemselves in trouble um that is the\nbiggest part that scares me is fentel\nmaking its way into all Pharmaceuticals\nlike\nbenzo um MDMA I'm thinking about some of\nthe things are taken\nrecreationally um benzo MDMA um is it in\ncannabis so most of what I've seen is\neither by itself fentanyl um using or\nthat it's mixed into pain pain um pills\na lot um why would kids want to take\npain pills I mean they're in pain\nthey're stressed they're or so they're\ndoing they're doing it sort of\nself-directed clinical correct or Prozac\nthey're anxious I see so it's not like\nthey're doing it for recreational drug\nuse at parties some are some aren't I\nmean there there's been so many\ndifferent\ncircumstances um cannabis and vaping\nhave been interesting debates and we\nactually had this just the other day uh\nsome of the studies suggest and the that\nand and suggest that biologically we\ncan't necessarily combine cannabis or\nnicotine and Fentanyl and have the same\nreaction on the body and some suggesting\nthat the studies haven't been there but\nand it's still so new but I will tell\nyou that they're that talking to teens\nand some some studies suggesting that\nyes teens are combining or at least\ngetting and a lot of times it's not\nknowingly it's cut the fentanyl is\ncutting or the the uh drug manufacturers\nand sellers are cutting a drug with\nfentanyl and so they're not even teens\nare knowing it but that some um I was\ntalking to a a person the other day who\nsaid that he has definitely heard of and\nseen some teens with fentanyl overdoses\nfrom Cannabis or from vaping so there's\nso much studies that are still needed\nright now and to understand the\nbiological mechanism um as well as the\nthe access to these drugs that we don't\nknow but I I'm nervous so we teach about\ndrug testing we teach about not getting\nsomething off it used to be a uh Skittle\ndrug uh parties you'd go and people\nwould take drugs and all different\nthings and put them in the in the middle\nof a bowl in the middle of the room and\njust you take whatever who oh yeah when\nwas that this is not long ago maybe 5 10\nyears ago I was hearing about these I\nnever went to a party like that I didn't\neither but I didn't go to many parties I\nwas I was Square kid but yeah it's\ninteresting may maybe it was just where\nit was I mean there were certainly drugs\naround but um I feel like now\nrecreational pharmacology it sounds like\nit's everywhere so so different yeah and\nself-medication is is everywhere that\nwasn't that wasn't common that wasn't as\ncommon but we or if it was people\nweren't talking about it I think it was\nI I remember as a middle school student\nwalking into the bathroom and somebody\nhad taken I think what's called a lwd\nthen and and had passed out um it it was\ncertainly around uh different drugs uh\nbut not the not the same that we're\nseeing now and we definitely saw cocaine\noverdoses when I was younger yeah I I\nfeel like there was a lot of weed\ncannabis that is um\nalcohol um Sil cyb and then as a\nrecreational drug now obviously it's\nbeing explored as a clinical tool as his\ncannabis for that matter um\nbut hard drugs like cocaine amphetamine\nwere PCP were discussed in the media a\nlot but and it certainly existed in some\nhigh schools and colleges and things\nlike that but sounds like it's seeping\nout of everywhere um it and it's in\nthese commercial products I mean I think\nthe picture that um has been created\nhere is kind of an ominous one so how\noptimistic are you I I will tell you I'm\noptimist istic in seeing a a change in\nthe landscape of Education now some\npeople say education doesn't work that\nwe need policies we need both I mean we\nwe have Federal policies and regulations\nthat are slipping through the cracks uh\nFDA with regulation of ecigarettes with\ncannabis uh legalization but not being\nenforced we have uh age restrictions not\nbeing enforced so we certainly need\neducation and I'm seeing more and more\npeople for example the concept of of\nharm reduction or comprehensive\neducation comprehensive sex said not\neverybody's of course up for it but or\nopen to it but I'm seeing more of a\nshift towards understanding the need I'm\ndefinitely seeing more teens as we were\ntalking about earlier more teens being\nwilling to say no that's not something\nI'm going to do more teens joining youth\ngroups more teens speaking out about\nconcerns and and trying to be healthier\nand make healthier decisions for\nthemselves so I'm optimistic in the the\nhuman capital and the social capital I'm\nnot optimistic when it comes to the the\npharmacology or or the drug Capital so\nto speak um more and more drugs\ninfiltrating infiltrating our youth I\nmean you could Vape dot dot dot anything\nnowadays and that makes me very nervous\nI do think vaping um and I am using\nvaping instead of eat cigarettes there\nto be more lay conversations there or or\nwhat the the the culture is saying\nvaping is just more normalized than it\nthan we've ever ever had it just like\nsmoking was\nnormalized vaping and now vaping\nanything is very scary to me and very\nmuch normalized so that worries me again\nthe fentanyl the hallucinate gens um\nmaking its way more and more so that the\ndrugs themselves and the new devices\nscares me the social and the human\ncapital gives me\noptimism very grateful to hear that you\nhave optimism sounds to me and correct\nme where I'm wrong please um and add\nanything that for parents for siblings\nfor teachers for educators or for any\nconcerned citizen it seems like having\nconversations about these things the\nfact that they're happening so not\nturning a blind eye the fact that um you\nknow kids are aware of it they're you\nknow that we're fooling ourselves if we\nthink that they aren't aware of these\nrisk-taking behaviors they're sort of\nthey're all around them uh anyway so we\nshouldn't shy away from those\nconversations and that at least having a\nconversation about the difference\nbetween avoiding behaviors and harm\nreduction is something that one ought to\nconsider I mean obviously this is a\nhousehold by household Choice absolutely\num in some cases school by school or\nclassroom by classroom choice but\ncertainly household maybe even parent by\nparent choice but that um because of\nsocial media and just because of the\nnature of Youth that young people are\nhaving these conversations anyway that\nthat's what I'm hearing coming through\nand that and that it you said don't\nformalize the conversation so much that\nyou know Saturday at 3:00 we're going to\nhave a discussion about drugs but make\nit part of the landscape to create some\nease um solely make it fasile to talk\nabout these things concerns um and\nprobably listen to them too they're\nright there in the midst of it um so\nthey have a data set internally about\nwhat what's actually\nhappening totally agree totally agree\nand and I often say to to parents or\nEducators if you're they're listening to\nthis podcast or any\nit it's actually say hey I I learned\nsomething can we have a conversation\nabout what I learned and not confront\nagain that it's a conversation not a\nconfrontation it's let's normalize drug\ndiscussions let's normalize uh Behavior\ndiscussions not normalize the use or the\nbehavior itself so talk to your teens\nyou're absolutely right talk to your\nteens this is what I just learned what\ndo you know can we find out some\ninformation\ntogether go on our reach websites go on\nother web websites go learn information\nout there learn together and not lecture\nbut have a conversation you may not know\nright away a team may not tell you right\naway yes I'm using or yes I'm having sex\nor yes I'm drinking alcohol or yes I'm\ndoing something that is just a risky\nBehavior but that's not necessarily our\ngoal is as adults to find out today\nwhether or not somebody is doing\nsomething it's okay okay to let it be a\nlittle bit more organic it's a it's okay\nto start that conversation and see\nthat's your building trust it is parent\nto parent but I would say I'm not going\nto bust you I certainly I'm not going to\nbe happy but let's have a conversation\nso that way we can build the trust and I\ncould help you either not use get help\nstop using or be safer in using or help\nyou prevent from using it all so having\nthat conversation that organic and and\ntalking to where they're at as a\ndevelopmentalist that's what we do meet\npeople where they're at meet youth where\nthey're at whether that's using already\nnot using don't come at them with your\npreconceived notions as an adult because\nit will not work it will backfire we\nneed to use the strengths young people\nare strong young people are smart we\nneed to use their strengths take their\nlead and then use our adult wisdom and\nexperiences to then turn that into the\nproper conversation I love it\nwell on the topic of conversation and\ncommunication one of the um kind of\nunique features of this podcast is that\nwe have a uh a large social media um\nfootprint um and inside of that\nfootprint we not only broadcast\ninformation but we get information back\nso in anticipation of uh this\nconversation today I reached out to uh\nfollowers of huberman lab social media\non X formerly known as Twitter and\nInstagram and they had a lot of\nquestions for you we don't have time to\ngo into the many thousands of questions\nbut I'm going to just ask you um if I\nmay in kind of a um short Q&A format a\nfew of them and if you don't have\nanswers you can just say pass we'll get\nback to that maybe we'll do another\nepisode another time uh please don't\nfeel um obligated to give thorough\nanswers this is uh we just wouldn't have\ntime yeah so one of the top questions\nis would love to learn more about how to\nget teens to see the longer term\nimplications of the choices they make\nand the habits they form now is there\nany way to get them to understand how\nnow leads to\nlater we've done studies where we've\nasked teens about their goals and I want\nto be a dancer we had one teen tell us\nor I want to be a doctor or I want to be\nwhatever it is asking teens about their\ngoals about their aspirations and then\nconnecting their current behavior and\ntheir current risks and and keeping\nthemselves healthy and how that plays\ninto their goals that tends to work a\nlot and we've seen that in our studies\nteens set boundaries I don't want to get\npregnant because I want to be a dancer\nthings like that so really linking what\nthey're doing now to their ultimate\ngoals is one way to really help them\nthink that through I like that how a\ndifferent maybe even larger goal um if\nyou could supersede these like\nshort-term behaviors and they could see\nhow those things link up absolutely\nthat's great um there's another question\ncame\nin requesting some positive news about\nteenagers to be shared quote every\ndiscussion is around risk or emotional\ndistress or social anxiety or phone\naddiction as if they're all\ndysfunctional U because of their brains\nwe never dismiss toddlers learning to\ntalk and walk because their brains are\noffline so I think the point is that um\nyou know can we highlight some of the\nways in which the Adolescent teen brain\nis um is exceptional at something that\nperhaps the rest of uh the brains out\nthere are not so I mentioned some of\nthem around our youth group and about\nthe youth movement now against drugs and\nand other things I think and it comes\nthe optimism I I I I'm the biggest teen\nAdvocate out there it's why I study\nadolescence and I do the prevention and\nadvocacy work that I do teenagers are\nfundamentally fantastic uh they're\ncreative they're passionate teens care\nabout the environment kids really teens\nreally care about social justice teens\ndo care about our future and our planet\nthat is wonderful well more than do\nadults right now so I think we should be\ncapitalizing on that teens are\nincredibly creative we need to be\nworking with teens and young adults in\neverything that we do because they are a\nfuture and I don't mean that as a cliche\nI really mean that so having the\nconversation let them be be part part of\nthat conversation help them find out\nwhat they think we should do to solve\nsome of the problems they're the ones to\ntalk to so I very optimistic about\nteenagers we have 40 teenagers who and\nyoung adults who work with us all the\ntime on our work because we trust them\nso I think some people are afraid of\nteens I embrace them I think they're\nfantastic love it do we know how vaping\nshapes the teen brain in other words are\nthere any known biological changes in\nthe developing brain as a consequence of\nof vaping and here I'm going to assume\nit's vaping nicotine but you know we\ntalked about um cannabis as it relates\nto uh psychosis earlier so let's just\nkeep it restricted to um nicotine sure\nwell we know that during the adolescence\nthat nicotine changes the brain wiring\nand what do I mean by that we're\nactually born with the nicotinic\nreceptors we're born with the ability to\nbecome addicted to nicotine same thing\nwith the um cannabis you were talking\nabout before so if we don't during the\nAdolescent time when we're pruning away\nand getting rid of the the connections\nthe neurons that we don't need what\nhappens is uh dur during that process\nanything that we don't use that we don't\nreinforce goes away well if we introduce\nnicotine in into our brain it solidifies\nit keeps that that receptor there and\nalso makes it to where our receptor is\nreally kind of I think of it as like um\nkeys and locks in a key and suddenly\nyou've got that receptor and it says ooh\nyou're putting nicotine in there keep\nthat in there or cups it's developing\nthose cups I often think about and\nfilling those cups with nicotine and\nthose cups are your receptors that were\nalready there you then take away that\nnicotine and your cups say I need more\nso you're rewiring your brain you're\nwiring your brain to be more likely to\nbecome addicted and now you're addicted\nand you need to keep feeding those cups\nwith nicotine or you're going to go\nthrough a withdrawal and so that is what\nH is happening during an adolescent and\nyoung adult that we don't see in adults\nthat's why we really want to keep young\npeople away from nicotine as long as\npossible a lot of questions about um are\nthere negative effects of of pornography\non the developing brain I imagine\nthere's a lot of literature on that yeah\nI I don't know as much actually in the\ndeveloping brain um I'm sure there is I\nI don't know it there is but there's\nclear evidence about viewing pornography\naround just not having goodal healthy\nsexual relationships because porn is not\nnormal it is it is not a normal\nrelationship between two people what you\nare doing is really making it so that\nway you um you're you're not necessarily\ndeveloping a healthy relationship with\nyour partner because you're assuming\nsome gold standard out there that may or\nmay not be able to be achieved so um and\nit also is also a problem with body\nshaming and the body types that most\npeople don't have and can't achieve and\nthat's that that's another problem out\nthere with with uh with with pornography\na lot of questions about how social\nmedia impacts brain development that's\nprobably an entire episode unto itself\nit is it is that that we could do\nanother time and we should and um if\nyou'd be so gracious to come back and do\nthat we we will um I think as a just a\nfinal question you know is there any um\ninformation about potential causality\nbetween the Mental Health crisis that we\nobserve in Youth and um let's just say\nsubstance use um of the sorts that we\ntalked about today obviously the\ndirectionality is tricky there you can\nimagine that a lot of HGC cannabis use\nis leading to more psychosis but seems\nmore likely that um kids are\nself-medicating correct in the face of\nlike immense challenge you know not just\nthe lockdowns and the culture around\nisolating kids from other kids and um\nthe stress that was on everybody um\nstress generally the sociopolitical\nlandscape social media I mean it's hard\nto not feel like it's at least a\ncloudier maybe a darker time than it\nused to be but I don't know I mean we\nhumans have evolved through a lot um and\nit I don't know that it's also fair to\nsay that everyone's you know bummed out\nabout what they see presumably there's\nstill some optimists out there so\nabsolutely uh there there plenty of\nstudies that show the bidirectional\nrelationship between anxiety depression\nMental Health and substance use you're\nright a lot of teens are self-medicating\nby using various substances to reduce\ntheir anxiety reduce their stress and\nalso just social lubrication right of\ngoing into a party and and pregaming or\ngoing into a party and using drugs to\nmake themselves uh less stiff less less\nstressed during that situation but more\nwhat we're talking about is that they're\nself-medicating because they're feeling\nsad or uncomfortable and this is they\nthink helping them again it's not\nhelping it's making them feel less bad\nhad by continuing to use but we also do\nknow that drugs also lead to suicidal\nideations suicide attempts psychosis and\nother mental health issues we also know\nthat drugs lead to reduce academic\nachievement um even though there's some\npotential uh cognitive in reinforcement\nthat's going on there's also some issues\nwith lack of\nconcentration the other piece by the way\nthat we didn't really talk about a lot\nbut is the co-use that we're seeing a\nlot of te not just using multiple\nproducts but using them together so a\nlot of teens who are chasing cannabis\nand tobacco because it enhances the high\nor they're using cannabis with alcohol\nand other mixing of drugs which is uh\nenhancing the high but not in a good way\nand very scary uh for for young people\nand and a lot of times young people\ndon't even realize like with blunts\nwhich is truly as I was saying before\nusing nicotine and cannabis together\nthat you're actually becoming addicted\nto both products\nreally\nsimultaneously and that we're seeing\nyoung people who are having mental\nhealth issues and depression more likely\nto use both products uh so definitely\nlinkage is there amongst mental health\nissues and multiple products as well so\npoly pharmacology yeah well I don't want\nto end on a down note but I don't think\nit's a down note I think uh what you've\ndone today and sharing with us the the\nrealistic landscape of What's Happen\nhappening out there and the realistic\nlandscape of what you're trying to do to\namarate these issues is uh nothing short\nof spectacular meaning uh as cloudy as\nit may seem in uh in our youth uh\nthere's also great hope in everything\nthat you're conveying which is um to put\nit simply uh why would you be trying so\nhard to fix these problems if you didn't\nbelieve that they could be fixed so so I\nI find great optimism in the message I\nalso I like data and you've shared with\nus a tremendous amount of data about\nwhat's happening what likely needs to\nchange and the optimal change an optimal\nroute to change as well as some you know\nrealistic perhaps less than optimal but\nrealistic approaches like sometimes it's\njust a matter of harm reduction there's\nwe're not going to eliminate these\npotentially dangerous behaviors or\ndangerous behaviors so for all of that I\nwant to say thank you it's a tremendous\ngift to us all and I know that we have a\nlot of parents and kids and nonparents\nand um every age um and background that\nlisten to this podcast and uh what's\nclear to me is that it's going to be a\ncommunity effort to try and face all\nthis and I keep hearing in the back of\nmy mind this thing that you've said\nseveral times now that kids know what's\nhappening we have to have these\nconversations they're hard conversations\nto have um for any of us they're\nuncomfortable for adults to have but\nthat until we normalize at least the\nconversation it's unlikely that we're\ngoing to solve these problems so thank\nyou for your incredible efforts in the\nresearch domain and also for helping to\nnormalize and bring about these\nconversations they're oh so important\nthank you so much thank you very much\nthank you for joining me for today's\ndiscussion with Dr Bonnie Halper
