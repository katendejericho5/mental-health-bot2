    "transcript": "\"Every night, for some\nstrange reason at 2:45 AM,\nI wake up, and it happens\nthree or four nights a week.\"\nMy first question to them is,\n\"How do you know it's 2:45?\" [chuckling]\nAnd they say, \"Well, I look at the clock,\"\nor \"I look at my phone.\"\nBest piece of advice next,\nremove all clock faces from the bedroom.\nNo matter how bad your sleep\nis going to be that night,\nknowing what time it is,\nis only going to make matters worse.\nIt is not going to make\nmatters any better.\nAnd that can create an anxiety trigger\nthat you think it's 2:45,\nand then you are tossing and turning.\nYou look back at the\nclock and now it's 3:14 AM\nand you think, \"I've\ngot to be awake at 6:00.\nI've got that big meeting.\"\nAnd now it's 5:25.\nDon't do that to yourself."
