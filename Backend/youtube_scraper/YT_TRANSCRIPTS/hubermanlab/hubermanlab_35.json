    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is Coleman Ru\nColeman Ruiz is a former tier one Navy\nSEAL special operator I think it's fair\nto assume that most of you have never\nheard of Coleman ruy before and in fact\nit was part of his former life job\ndescription to be largely covert such\nthat only his family and friends really\nknew what he did for a living he is\nhowever now living as a civilian and the\nreason I invited Coleman on this podcast\nwas essentially to tell us his life\nstory which of course includes his time\nin the SEAL Teams but includes so much\nmore that I'm certain is of value to\neveryone today Coleman shares with you\nhis remarkable Journey from childhood\nthrough his teenage years into the\nmilitary and some of the things that\nhappened during his time in the military\nwhich then informed his postmilitary\ncivilian life and what it is to be a\nfather a husband and somebody who has\nexperienced tremendous loss at various\nstages of his life as well as tremendous\nTriumph indeed if ever there was a life\nthat could be framed within the context\nof the so-called Heroes Journey it is\nthe life of Coleman Ruiz Coleman ruiz's\nlife is one that embodies focus and\npursuit family and friends and love all\nthe things that we think of in terms of\nhaving a rich life but also one that\nincludes many unforeseen tragedies many\nunforeseen challenges both internal and\nexternal Coleman also shares with a rare\nan extraordinary degree of vulnerability\nthe extent to which challenges in life\nboth external and internal have helped\nshape him as a human being what follows\nis a discussion that everyone male\nfemale young or old and regardless of\nposition in life is sure to derive\ntremendous benefit from before we begin\nI'd like to emphasize that this podcast\nis separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer

everything\nour mental health our physical health\nperformance in any sports or School Etc\nall get better and when we're not\nsleeping well or enough all those things\nsuffer one of the key things to getting\na great night's sleep is that your body\ntemperature actually has to drop by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees in order to fall\nand stay deeply asleep and in order to\nwake up feeling refreshed your body\ntemperature actually has to increase by\nabout 1 to 3 degrees one of the best\nways to ensure that happens is to\ncontrol the temperature of your sleeping\nenvironment and with Aid sleep it makes\nit very easy to do that you program in\nthe temperature that you want at the\nbeginning middle and end of the night\nyou can even divide temperature for two\ndifferent people if you have two\ndifferent people sleeping in the bed and\nit tracks your sleep it tells you how\nmuch slow wave sleep and rapid eye\nmovement sleep you're getting it really\nhelps you dial in the correct parameters\nto get the best possible night sleep for\nyou I've been sleeping on an eight Sleep\nmattress cover for well over 3 years now\nand it has completely transform my sleep\nfor the better if

that's 8sleep.com\nhuberman and now for my conversation\nwith Coleman Ru Coleman Ru welcome thank\nyou very excited to see you it's great\nto have you\nhere I'm guessing most people are\nprobably not familiar with Coleman ruy\nso let's start at the\nbeginning where were you born what was\nthe context of your home\nlife and maybe let's get up to maybe\nelementary school middle school and uh\nwhatever top Contour or deep details you\nwant to get into yeah we're all yours\nokay I'll bring us up to seventh grade\nbecause I would say that was probably\nthe first big inflection point in my\nlife I grew up in I was born in New\nOrleans in a suburb called East New\nOrleans East we call it and uh have\nolder sister two younger brothers my dad\nwas a\nwelder my mom was a dental assistant and\nwe had a couple of boxers in the\ndogs and we had a very\nmodest very modest upbringing I won't\noverd dramatize it but you know\nadmittedly you know sometimes we got\ncheese from the lady across the street\nwho didn't want her welfare cheese and\nit was one of those you know I could\ntell my parents were fighting for every\nnickel and but it was great I mean my\ncousin grew up across the street from me\nhe's exactly my age we had that at least\nsome of my memory Andrew of it was it\nwas very very pleasant I learned later\nthat you forget a lot of things in your\nchildhood were unpleasant but my initial\nmemories when I started thinking about\nthis kind of thing and you know as you\nand I have discussed getting\nprofessional help and you start to learn\na little bit more about your childhood\nbut I remember it being very pleasant\nyou know we've you've told me about your\nbackground and skateboarding and stuff\nyou know we skateboarded the\nneighborhood BMX was a big thing when we\nwere kids it was very much a rat the\nstreets upbringing there was a park\nbehind the neighborhood we would cut\nthrough the fence and go you know this\nkind of thing I played football and\nbaseball and very normal in that regard\nwent to the neighborhood school and then\nin sixth grade I went to what was my\nhigh school but it went it went fifth\nthrough 12th called Holy Cross High\nSchool in the Lower Ninth Ward which\nthat spot is now vacated because the\nschool I went back after Hurricane\nKatrina the whole school had to be moved\nand I went there in seventh\ngrade and it was a hellacious start I\nmean it was detention after detention\nyou know fist fight after fist fight and\ndamn near were you the instigator of\nthose fights probably some I definitely\nfell in with the wrong crowd initially\nin that sixth and seventh grade years\nand um I wouldn't say it was so extreme\nthat like it was complete Mayhem but I\nwas definitely on you know problem\nsituation number whatever when my\nparents were called in and it was kind\nof the last straw type thing and um I\ngot cut from baseball my grades were\nfine I was always a pretty good student\nit was just teenager\nShenanigans and then I went out for\nwrestling can can I just uh pause you\nfor a second so on the the violence part\num have a little bit of experience with\nthis but uh violence can come from\ntrying to protect others yeah uh\ninstigating uh it can come from the wild\njust trying to you know see what it\nfeels like\nexperimentation and any number of other\nthings all the way to Pure sociopathy\nwhich we know you you are not um and\nweren't do you recall feeling something\ninside that inspired this was it for\nattention did it feel good\nafterwards um yeah can you recall what\nit was about I think it was the wildness\nthing Andrew honestly it\nwasn't I mean I believe I don't have a\nmalicious Bon my body like we all have\nthat in us obviously my profession later\nin the military you know I was able to\nactivate that and I feel like I still\ncan and I was certainly able to in\nsports which is why that seventh grade\nyear was really\npivotal but even now it's funny it's\neven funny you ask about the wildness\nbecause let me put it in movie terms\nlike one of my favorite movie scenes of\nall time is in the movie The Town when\nBen Affleck walks in the room J rener is\nthe you know his his partner essentially\nand he walks in the room and he says\nwe're going to hurt somebody I can't\ntell you where and I can't tell you when\nand he pauses and Jeremy rener takes\nmaybe a 3se second pause and he says\nwhose car are we taking he doesn't even\nask you know he's just they're just wild\nand excited about doing something wild I\ndon't promote like going to hurt\nsomebody of course sure were you the\nAffleck or the rener Affleck excuse me\nor rener in that I\nwas I I feel like I was mostly the\nrener put it this way if if you have\nsome good idea this\nafternoon like let's go try this\nI'm good I'm ready and I think it's just\nexciting you know I I I hate rules I\nhate being told what to do it's one of\nthe things that was so frustrating about\nthe military I the rules are in place\nfor a reason they're Written in Blood I\nget all that but we're so constrained\nsometimes I think that was just all\ncoming into fruition that seventh grade\nyear and I enjoyed going wild like it\nwas just fun and frankly we weren't\nthese fist fights and this trouble\nwasn't like going to get some kid those\nother kids wanted the wildness too you\nknow and so but the school didn't want\nthat and then I went out for wrestling\nthat year and I could put it all into\nthe wrestling room and it was\nawesome before we talk about wrestling\nand why it was so meaningful as a\nchannel for you\nuh a little bit of neurobiology or else\nI wouldn't be great uh Andrew huberman\nuh there's a really interesting\nphenomenon that one observes in both\nanimals and humans which is that\nsomewhere around adolescence MH when the\nhormone surge begins but even before\nthat there's a phenomenon called\ndispersal um it's very different than\nfighting per se or sexual activity per\nse it's a it's a literal dispersal from\none's home environment or an animals a\nnest in which animals and humans and\nwe're animals after all start forging\nnew environments in in a very as you\npoint out chaotic way it's not organized\nit's a little nuts and it um and\nbiologists and neurobiologists in\nparticular have observed changes in\nneural circuitry that that drive this so\nsome of it's hormonal but a lot of it is\nthe brain taking all this input that one\nhas been exposed to sun earth food\nothers social interactions and starting\nto essentially throw the different\nPaints the different colors of paint\ntogether and just trying things um some\nkids are more uh prone to this than\nothers certainly has a hormonal\ncomponent boys and girls tend to do this\ndifferently but they both Do It um and\npsychologists and neurobiologists see\nthis as a fundamental shift in our\nunderlying circuitry so um just a little\nbit of food for thought to put what you\njust described in context with that said\ntell us about wrestling I mean Andrew in\nmany ways like I said that was the first\ninflection point it was\nlike immediate I mean immediate uptake\nwithin a week I knew this was my thing\nmaybe maybe the first practice what do\nyou think it was so when I was younger\nmy aunt and uncle when I was like seven\nyears old they started taking me to road\nraces and I'm sure uh just running races\none mile and 5K races when I was really\nsmall kid for you to run mhm to run with\nthem they were into the road racing\nthing back in the day when it was brand\nnew you know the ' 80s um I'm 48 so I\nwas born in 75 so I was seven you know 8\nyears old at the\ntime and I was into like obviously can I\nwin this race I just the\npain of the effort was so\ncomfortable and then it's kind of silly\nbut like I won the P PT competition at\nlike the Boy Scouts thing in otan park\nis physical yeah physical training\nphysical training so I won like the\nwhatever when I was young in Boy Scouts\nor something and and then it just\nsnowballed then I was just like the\nphysical\nactivity still today is I mean if\nsomeone said what are you really in love\nwith it's it's that and so when I walked\ninto the wrestling room it was so\nextreme compared to anything else I had\never done football baseball whatever I\nnever really liked any of those Sports I\nplayed them all um but I didn't like him\nand always my dad wrestled in high\nschool and college and um we were we\nwere you know always rough and tumble in\nthat regard and I haven't have a couple\nof buddies in the teams you know who\nobviously we're College wrestlers\nthere's a lot of wrestlers in the teams\nand people would always joke about how\nwe're so handsy and you know our hands\nare always on each other and that was\njust a thing for us like I loved the\nclose contact I love the fight of it\nwhat I really love about Combat Sports\ncuz I boxed in high school between\nwrestling\nSeasons um was the respect\ntell me more about that you just don't\nhave there are some of course like you\ncan see guys hyping it up and doing\ntheir thing in UFC these days and that's\ntotally fine but for the most part if\nyou have fighters of any type like in a\nsetting when they don't have to do you\nknow the stuff for TV and\nwhatnot they respect each other because\nand they respect the effort and because\nyou know what it takes and you know how\nhard it is to face another man in the\nmiddle of a mat with no equipment and\nnowhere to run and no timeouts and no\none to tap in that's extreme you know\nand it may not seem like high school\nwrestling is Extreme but as you just\nmentioned something about you know\ndevelopment when you're 14 and you're\nfacing another like that's the first\ntime is someone trying to take your life\nno they're not but it feels that way and\nthen you go and you put in all these\nhours of training and you don't eat\nduring the week and you run stadiums or\nyou run levies and you know fireman's\ncarries and and all of it while you're\nnot eating and making weight and you're\nin the sauna and it's just a very tough\nthing to do Combat Sports and I love the\nrespect that it engenders between the\npeople who do it I think it was Sam\nSheridan who wrote A Fighter's heart uh\nan excellent book and for anyone male or\nfemale age who's interested in the human\nSpirit uh I recommend a Fighter's heart\nbecause it's about the different fight\nsports but it's really about um the path\nof\nself-discovery that occurs in various\nmartial arts and as you said like\nespecially boxing is very gentlemanly\nyou touch gloves you start you know then\nthe you know the Bell goes off you go to\nyour corner like it's you know sometimes\npeople lose it bite off people's ears\nand things like that but but for the\nmost part the sport is very um\nstructured um as you were doing this uh\nwhat was happening with school um did it\nhelp uh your academic studies did it\nkeep them more or less the same and how\ndid your family and your peer group view\nwhat you were doing were you considered\nstrange for liking wrestling so much I\nmean you're dieting right you're a young\nmale dieting for purpose of sport and\nperformance you're sitting in saunas\nyou're running in wrapped in plastic\nbags all this like I mean uh a good\nfriend of ours who was also in the Ste\nteams uh said one said to me he said you\nknow wrestlers are different and I think\nhe meant different in quotes yeah I\nthink that's true um I you know School\nmy grades immediately went up Andrew it\nwas like oh my gosh the discipline of\nall of it my grades were always better\nin wrestling season than out of\nwrestling season interesting like when I\nwas cut loose out of the structure then\nit wasn't good and and and you know\nbetween seventh and eighth grade and all\nthat I didn't have any crazy Shenanigans\ngoing on I wasn't going to get kicked\nout of school whatever I was doing\nnormal stuff for the age but so the\nfight stopped totally totally because I\ncould put it into I could put it into\nthe wrestling space you know and I think\nI grew up obviously in New Orleans and I\nthink you know down there it's baseball\nfootball basketball wrestling is not I\nmean I was lucky to wrestle in college\nat all because it wasn't like Iowa was\nlooking to recruit me you know they have\nplenty of people to recruit and they\ndon't need any Louisiana wrestlers\nalthough Daniel Cormier grew up like\nnorth of the lake was four four years\nyounger I was telling this to somebody\nwe don't know each other I'd love to\nmeet him super impressive athlete we\nheard that hey there's some kid up in\nthe NorthShore um I think is where he\ngrew up whooping everybody's ass and his\nname's Daniel Cormier and then you know\nobviously the rest is history but the\nsport is not big in Louisiana which is\nall to say that we were kind of a\nunicorn we had was very odd at my high\nschool specifically we had one coach his\nson either National runner up his name\nwas Willie Gatson Willie's Willie passed\naway I think his son ended up at Iowa\nState and within the last five or six\nyears was either a national champ or a\nrunner up Willie when I was in eth grade\nAndrew Willie was at my high school like\nI have no idea how Willie got and ended\nup in New Orleans but we ended up with\nthis cluster of wrestlers at that time\nwith the right coaching and a few kids\nwere going to Junior College and coming\nback and wrestling in college and coming\nback and there were three or four guys I\nremember specifically in eighth grade\nbecause I started at least in the junior\nhigh ranks I started to take off my\nsecond year these guys would abuse me in\nthe wrestling room they were seniors in\nhigh school I was 112 PBS or 132 pounds\nmy freshman year and they would just in\nmy eighth grade year and they would just\nabuse me Define abuse in all the legal\nnormal wrestling ways like there's the\nwrestling gets broken up obviously by\nweights you got the heavy weights on one\nend of the room the lightweights on the\nother end of the room and the young kids\nstay with the young kids for the most\npart and a few of these guys would drag\nme down to the varsity end and I would\nwrestle with the middleweights and they\nwould beat the out of me\nand eventually you get to the point\nwhere you're like this I have I had\nenough you know and that's when sort of\nthings started to turn but I think that\nwrestlers are different and my peer\ngroup one or two of my really good\nfriends wrestled but most of them played\nother sports and\nso but in in every sense of the word\nlife got better for me because of that\nsport it changed my life so you wrestled\nall through high school oh yeah yep at\nat that point were you discovering\nrelationships\ngirls um were you partying were you a\ndrinker use drugs no drugs I mean it's\nNew Orleans right it's like one of the\nthings it was tough I'm glad I got out\nof the city frankly because it was Party\nTime Out outside the season yeah girls\nGirlfriends normal stuff in that regard\nlots of drinking lots of rat in the\nstreets you know in those days in the\n90s um but you kept it inside the lane\nlines sounds like no drunk driving no\narrest we did a little bit of that but\nnot nothing crazy in that regard I think\nI understood the consequences and I\nreally cared about my career I really\nwanted to wrestle in college my grades\nwere excellent my SAT scor is not so\nmuch but\num I started winning really fast and you\nknow my last two years in high school I\nwas 89 and0 and I almost won my\nsophomore year so I was runner up in the\nstate my sophomore year I always joke\nwith the with the boys I my all my boys\nare way better athletes than I ever\ncould think about being son yeah yeah\nand\num but in eth grade I made varsity and\nit was like was eighth grade yeah and I\nlost like 75% of the matches you know\nbut you just grinded out and it's how I\ngot into the Naval Academy which is a\nwhole another story but so let's talk\nabout that so you finished finished high\nschool mhm uh you head to the Naval\nAcademy why the Naval Academy there's\nactually a crazy story behind this which\nmaybe we Circle back to but\num the\nsummer gosh I had forgotten that this\nstarted in 7th grade too the summer\nbetween my seventh and eighth grade year\nmy grandfather was\ntoo young to joined the Navy and he\nwanted to go to the Naval Academy um\nduring World War II and he lied to the\nrecruiter and got into the merchant\nmarines his I'm pretty sure first cousin\nmy uncle and my cousins are like first\ncousins once REM removed my Uncle Jim\nTHL was at a family reunion in\nMississippi which we were at and he\ndidn't mention to Naval Academy family\nreunion ends they all go home and he\nstarts sending me Naval Academy\nparaphernalia I knew nothing about the\nmilitary\nand I just thought about it you know and\nhe would send me stuff you know you\ndidn't we didn't have the internet right\nyou sending these booklets and you don't\nlike Authority no so I I've not been in\nthe military but I've done some work\nwith yall and um there's a there's a lot\nof uh hierarchy and Authority yeah\nthat's true it it the truth and was like\nit was just it just seemed exciting I\nwasn't really thinking about the\nimplications as 18-year-olds you know it\nlooked very exciting to me and having\ngotten some professional help in the\nintervening years what I really think\nwas a big part of it was my parents got\ndivorced my senior year in high school\nand the family unit just blew up right\nand\nso it also represented an escape you\nknow get out and go get your life out of\nthe New Orleans and just go just go do\nsomething were you a part of that uh\nthat obviously you were a part of the\nfamily that got divorced was it chaotic\nwas it uh controlled you and I are the\nexact same age we're both 48 born in 75\num back then it was a lot less common\nfor um people being they called them\nbroken homes back then yeah you know um\nnowadays I don't think they call that\neveryone just cites the statistic that\nyou know more than half of marriages end\nin in divorce as if it perhaps to\nnormalize it um but that's more than\nhalf um do you recall feeling um\ndistraught about that or was it just\nkind of the natural consequence of\nsomething you had observed a long time\nlike oh that kind of makes sense that no\nit was a shock to me it wasn't shock to\nmy older\nsister\num I just remember com this was the\nthought at the time I this is like\nseared in my brain this has nothing to\ndo with\nme that wasn't like some sophisticated\nview it was mostly this I'm not\ndealing with this I have my own life\nthey're going to have to do what they're\ngoing to do meaning my parents I'm\ngetting the hell out of here not a bad\nmindset for a kid at that stage if it\nhad been four years younger that might\nnot be the the best mindset but as\nyou're heading off to college that's\nreasonably healthy mindset as opposed to\ngetting am meshed in the what happened\nin and this and that can I ask you at at\nthat stage you're 17 18 years old at\nthat point um were you journaling at\nthat point no no no journaling no\nintrospective work zero no school\npsychologist no no thinking about or\ntalking about your feelings it's\nwrestling Naval Academy social things\nSchool SATs like like very standard\nwe're almost like talking like a\nsuperficial list of like what happens at\nthe end of high school in 1992 Andrew\nit's a the the word superficial and I\ncarried this forward for years which I'm\nsure we'll talk about here in a\nsecond those binary Focus\nareas like I was literally just going\nafter them at Full\nSteam Stronger Faster more intensity\nwith zero introspection no excavation of\nthe of the psychology of anything just\nfull steam ahead like let's go no\nmeditation no breath work\nzero which was not adaptive in the long\nrun and we we'll get to uh how that\nplayed out in the long run but\nnonetheless um you got into the Naval\nAcademy well didn't first okay so I\napplied I I get you know my uncle's\ndoing all this stuff anyway I applied\nand I didn't I still have the letter the\nthanks but no thanks you know you're not\nqualified how'd that hit you\nat the time it hit me kind of like\neverything I did when that age when it\ndidn't work out it admittedly Andrew it\nwas it was\nlike there's got to be a way around this\nlike has to work out but it but it\nfeels terrible right like it you have a\nmoment of what do we\ndo\nand my kids have heard the story a\nmillion times my wife was a blue chip\nswimming recruit for a navy and so she\nwas into the Naval Academy when she was\nat the beginning of her senior year of\nhigh school right what's a blue chip I I\nmean in my understanding a blue chip is\nlike you are at the very top of the list\nand the coaches put you straight into\nthe admission cycle saying nobody else\ngets in until this person does so they\nwanted her they didn't want you I Not\nonly was she a blue chip and I was and I\ngot the no\num I guess well the wrestling coach\ncalled me a couple of weeks after my no\nwhich is now in may I'm about to\ngraduate from high school I'm not\naccepted anywhere you only applied one\nplace actually to which you may bur bust\nout laughing when I tell you what the\nother one is because no internet I got a\nmailer in a pamplet from Stanford the\nwrestling coach I didn't know what\nStanford was I had no idea that the\ncollege was even prestigious I didn't\nknow they had a wrestling team I filled\nout the application and wrote the letter\nthing and I sent it into Stanford and of\ncourse never heard back from them but I\napplied to two places Stanford and the\nUS Naval Academy well for those that\nfollow wrestling I'm I get into either\nright uh that's a great story and I'll\njust briefly mention that a few years\nago there almost wasn't a wrestling team\nat Stanford they uh had plans to cut the\nwrestling team despite having a NCAA\nchampion at Stanford but you know the\npower of people Gathering and and\npetitioning works and um wrestling and a\nfew other sports that were being cut\nfrom the curriculum um were spared it's\namazing yeah rescued so happy to see\nthat yeah so that so it Stanford does\nhave a wrestling team so the coach the\ncoach back to like how I ended up\ngetting in I appreciated my my college\ncoach called and he said there I'm\nrecruiting I have one more spot at the\nprep school which is in Newport Rhode\nIsland I'm recruiting another kid from\nPennsylvania if he takes that spot then\nI don't have anything\nleft and we were exploring going to prep\nschool and stuff like that oblique ways\nto get in and he called me sometime in\nMay like right around graduation and\nsaid can you be in Newport in July that\nkid went to I think he went to Lehi\nand I I went to the prep school so\nNewport Rhode Island yeah in Newport for\na year and there it's a nice place yeah\nit's great yeah and so you wrestle for I\nmean you do school you know you're\nyou're in West Point has a prep school\nand Colorado Springs has a prep school\nand so we joke that my wife was first\nperson in our class accepted and I was\nlast which is highly possible\nactually I'd like to take a brief break\nand acknowledge our sponsor ag1 by now\nmost of you have heard me tell my story\nabout how I've been taking ag1 once or\ntwice a day every day since 2012 and\nindeed that's true I started taking ag1\nand I still take ag1 once or twice a day\nbecause it gives me vitamins and\nminerals that I might not be getting\nenough of from Whole Foods that I eat as\nwell as adaptogens and micronutrients\nthose adaptogens and micronutrients are\nreally critical because even though I\nstrive to eat most of my foods from\nunprocessed or minimally processed Whole\nFoods it's often hard to do so\nespecially when I'm traveling and\nespecially when I'm busy so by drinking\na packet of ag1 in the morning morning\nand often times also again in the\nafternoon or evening I'm ensuring that\nI'm getting everything I need I'm\ncovering all of my foundational\nnutritional needs and I like so many\nother people that take ag1 regularly\njust report feeling better and that\nshouldn't be surprising because it\nsupports gut health and of course gut\nhealth supports immune system health and\nbrain health and it's supporting a ton\nof different cellular and organ\nprocesses that all interact with one\nanother so while certain supplements are\nreally directed towards one specific\noutcome like sleeping better or being\nmore alert ag1 really is foundational\nnutritional support it's really designed\nto support all of the systems of your\nbrain and body that relate to mental\nhealth and physical health if you'd like\nto try ag1 you can go to drink a1.com\nhuberman to claim a special offer\nthey'll give you five free travel packs\nwith your order plus a year supply of\nvitamin D3 K2 again that's drink a1.com\nhuberman so you're in Newport does that\nhave a a portal to the naval Academy\nyeah if you graduate prep school you're\nyou're straight into the Naval Academy\nlike they fully expect you to be there\nthe next year when junior year rolled\naround M um and Senior rolled around of\nhigh school didn't anyone pull you aside\nand say Hey you might want to like apply\nto a few other\nplaces uh you might want to consider\nwhat you do if this doesn't work out\nwhat did they assume you were going to\ndo they just head into the City of New\nOrleans and um bus\ntables zero guidance Andrew really like\nfrom my high school and I think\nthink the ecosystem I was in like people\njust didn't really know how to do that\nyou know how to apply to schools I mean\nmy parents obviously helped when I\napplied to the Naval Academy but when I\nwhen I look at the system that kids go\nthrough now to go you know their process\nto find the best college\nexperience I never had one conversation\nwith a guidance counselor about what to\ndo I just didn't I mean I just got very\nlucky a few people my\nmy high school wrestling coach\nintervened I think at some point and\ncalled the Naval Academy to speak to the\ncoach to say you should give this kid a\nchance but he didn't they didn't know\nwho he was you know I'm so lucky and so\nfortunate that I ended up where I ended\nup it's it's why I took it so seriously\nlike the focus with which I applied my\ntime in high school the I took that to\n10x degree when I got to Newport because\nI knew this was my chance\nthere's something magical to that I can\nrelate to that so uh so you're in\nNewport yeah and describe what a day was\nlike is it all wrestling you're taking\ngeneral education classes like one does\nin the in the first two years of\nUniversity yep so the way the way the\nprep school is set up for the Naval\nAcademy is they're basically teaching\nyou the first semester of the Naval\nAcademy so you take calculus physics\nchemistry I think you take an English\nclass Etc and um you go through like a\npretty hellacious first couple of weeks\ncuz you're away from the flag pole where\nno one can hear you scream you know\nyou're up in Newport you're not in\nAnnapolis where Everyone's Watching and\nyou do a couple hellacious weeks for an\n18-year-old who's never been in the\nmilitary before so you're in the\nmilitary technically if you go to this\nyou're actually enlisted in the Navy\nokay so they they own you to some extent\nyeah yeah yeah they do and then you do\nyou're wearing uniforms you're jogging\nin the morning you're doing salutes and\nmarching Yep bugling they're doing Taps\nin the evening yep all of it got it yep\nand you live there's 300 people at the\nprep school it's distributed basically\namongst folks coming from the fleet so\nguys who did four five years in the\nmilitary somewhere and they're coming\ninto the Naval Academy from the fleet\nand then athletes and then sort of a\nmixture of other folks who need a little\nextra school right and so and then you\ndo a full school year you're competing\nit's basically a red shirt year that's\nnot a red shirt year I competed up and\ndown the East Coast against you know all\nthe other prep schools and you finish\nthat year in May and then you know\nyou're done with the prep the prep year\nis fine it's a little bit of a a shock\nwhen you're 18 but it's fine always been\ncurious about these military schools and\nthe people that go to them and what\nhappens to people there uh did you have\nany sense of patriotism prior to\narriving at this prep school and did\nthat sense of patriotism you know I'm\ntalking like love of country uh\nunderstanding the the history of our\ncountry and its position in the in the\ninternational landscape are you thinking\nabout that stuff are they feed you that\nor is it really like wrestling get\nthrough the March shower up go to the\nnext thing is it is it very like plug\nand- chug no no the the feeding of and I\nreally appreciated this the feeding of\nthose Concepts starts when you get\nthere but I was deer in the headlights\nand like I didn't think about my life in\nthis way at all when I was headed there\nI mean what what you get very early\nbecause the\nschool very quickly starts to bring\nreally high level accomplished people\nColonels Admirals whatever generals to\nexpose you to this people I do remember\nsitting there that within\nweeks like this is way bigger than I\nthought it was in terms\nof how serious this situation is you\nknow um and how serious this ecosystem\nof people take this because I didn't\nhave my dad wasn't an admiral he was a\nwelder in New Orleans you know I didn't\nunderstand the bigness of of it one of\nthe reasons I asked this is that various\ntimes throughout my life I've had this\nexperience of like seeing people close\nto me doing incredible work you know\nlike when I was a post talk at Stanford\nI had Nobel Prize was given that one\nweek to the guy next door to me yeah so\nyou see him in the morning and like\nyou're hearing it on the radio and uh\nobviously I didn't have that kind of um\nstature or talent in science I think I'm\na good scientist but um good enough to\nyou know get tenure at Stanford but then\nthere there are levels within the game\nyeah but there is something very special\nto the experience of having people close\nto you physically and in the same\necosystem as you described it achieving\namazing things I also saw this in\nskateboarding I mean there were a lot of\nuh let's just say uh failures uh to uh\nintegrate with normal life but there\nwere also some guys that I grew up with\nwho started companies and set world\nrecords and you know had their Pro\nModels and then if you zoom out from\nthat and you go wait I'm in this\ncommunity it changes one's self viw\nabout what's possible so I think that's\nwhat you're describing and I think it's\nsuch an important thing for people to\nexperience at some point even if the\ngoal isn't to be at kind of world scale\nyou know for people to realize that the\ntown they grew up and the family they\ngrew up in that context can expand yes\nand so do you recall being at this prep\nschool and kind of third personing\nyourself and thinking like well I'm\nColeman Ruiz I'm from New Orleans I went\nfrom this to this to this the way you've\nbeen describing it and I'm here and\nthey're like I'm around some incredibly\nimpressive people and I'm here like once\nyou make that recognition that you're\nthere a whole bunch of things can open\nup no I actually came at it from the\nopposite way and this has been a hard\nthing for me my whole life and I have to\nwatch out for this\nperspective is I felt like every day I\nhad to wake up and earn my place there I\nwas never good enough for myself\never so next day up is a restart to\nprove myself again on whatever standard\nI'm picking that day right looking back\non it I\nrealized it was somewhat arbitrary\nbecause it was just day by day I didn't\nthink I'm Coleman Ru as I made it here\nlook I'm part of this e i I was\nafraid like Mike Tyson talks about being\nafraid every time I was afraid every day\nand I fought\nfor like a position in this place every\nday now that was adaptive in some\nregards right mm very because to me it\nwas let's go like today's another new\nday and it's 100% Allin full go I hope\neverybody's ready did you ever recall\nfalling asleep at night and thinking\nlike well like I had a good day I had a\ngood day or or I'm scared you know\nthey're going to discover I can't keep\nup or I can't keep up all the time so a\nlot of fear I mean yeah yeah a lot of\nfear all the time and and some of it I\ndo I I I genuinely know and believe\nAndrew that it was well-intentioned like\nI wanted to do a good job for the group\nwhatever group I was in my platoon my\nsquad in the case of the prep school you\nknow that first\nexperience I I mean I I was talking\nabout this with with my wife the other\nday just because stories come up you\nknow we had a 25th reunion at the Naval\nAcademy and this kind of thing and um I\nwas a really good runner for my group in\nhigh school like the people I was around\nI ran cross country when I was young and\nanyway I did I suppose I'm going the\nother I I sort of did have some level of\nconfidence in my ability then I got\nthere and like all these college cross\ncountry Runners are like my son is now\njust crushing me and I think sadly\nbecause it was just sort of in me that\nfed my fear like I thought I was\nbetter than this clearly I suck I have\nto get to their level so um I did have a\nvery well-intentioned excitement around\njust do a good job with the people\nyou're around there's something fun to\nthat and wild you know as we spoke about\num but I was operating out a fear for\ndecades but there was a I need to get to\ntheir level statement in there it wasn't\nI can't keep up I better find a\ndifferent path no no no no I knew I\ncould I knew I could get to their level\nwith enough work you know was that\nsomething that your your father or your\nmother or both had instilled in you that\nfor sure MH yeah and my high school\nwrestling coach was\num let's call it maybe from the old\nschool mhm if you worked hard enough you\ncould you could you could get there you\nknow so this is the essence of growth\nmindset long before Carol D coined the\nthe phrase growth mindset yeah yet when\nI first read a book I'm like don't\npeople teach us this when we were\nkids yeah you know well some of us got\nit some of us didn't and it can be very\ncontext dependent right I think that's\none of the more important often\noverlooked aspects of Carol's work and\nAli crumb's work is that we can develop\ngrowth mindset in one domain of life but\nthen another domain of life we get you\nknow kicked in the teeth once and we're\nlike I can't do that there's a carve out\nwhere I can't function some people do\nthat some people don't and um and we\ndon't understand enough about it um to\nunderstand you know whether or not it's\na global circuit you know and it's\nthere's a lot of context but okay so\nyou're you're hanging in there at least\nyou're surrounded by some very\nimpressive people there's a lot of\nstructure\nso we're a long way from the pre-\nwrestling days when yeah this is the\nopposite of chaos totally this is\nstructure yeah you told what to do every\nfive minutes more or less and this is um\nscary feelings fear is a scary feeling\nuh but you're channeling it and you said\nthe unit of the day became important\nit's like what can I do today yes you're\nnot thinking about the week you're not\nthinking about the season you're not\nthinking about becoming some war hero\ndown the line you're just 24 hours and\ndo the next day yeah how was your\nselfcare at that point or is that built\ninto the system it's not built into the\nsystem and it was Zero I mean it really\nwas Andrew like it was the old\nschool we were not doing anything\nsophisticated back\nthen I mean there was no we\nstretched and in the grand scheme of\nthings is going to sound weird because\nthere still is a lot of you know primal\nnature to Combat Sports but in the grand\nscheme of things we were probably on the\nupper end of sophisticated like\nwrestlers jump rope they stretch they do\naerobics you know um been in auna since\n1993 you know it's like not purposeful\nnot for to cut weight in a garbage bag\nbut there is some level\nof some level of balancing out your\ntraining you know wrestlers like to swim\nin the like during the season because\nyou're getting out of that room like you\nend up accidentally doing some of these\nthings but there was no selfcare so you\neventually go to the Naval Academy MH 94\nthe actual Naval Academy and that's\nwhere you met your wife yep in '96 my\nsophomore year so when you get there\nwhat what's different than the prep\nschool first of all\nit's big in the macro not just\ngeographically big or footprint square\nfootage wise it's big the concept is Big\nyou know\nlike the superintendent of the school is\na three star admiral you hear about his\ncareer you know you're 19 years old you\nmeet so there's\ntwo incredibly important people in my\nlife at in those early years at the\nNaval\nAcademy a guy named Doug zbec who's dead\nnow who most people of my service time\nwill know who he is\num when I was on my recruiting trip to\nthe Naval Academy and I was in high\nschool this is complete accident Doug\nwas a sophomore we call him youngsters\nat the Naval Academy he was a sophomore\nand we're the same weight class so coach\nmatched us up because it was my\nrecruiting visit and my first this is\nback to being wild literally my first\nnight on the grounds of the Naval\nAcademy I'm sleeping on Doug zek's floor\nof his of his room with his other two\nroommates\nand sometime around 3: or 4\na.m. I get woken up it's like a bomb\ngoes off there's a bom didn't go off but\nthere's 12 other gorillas in the room\nall wrestlers maybe one or two other\nguys and Doug is hustling I don't know\nany of these people Andrew like I just\nmet Doug the previous evening we just\nflew into\ntown he wakes me up he's hustling me to\nget my shoes\non again I'm just this High School kid\nand then within 2 to 3 minutes all 15 of\nthese gorillas bolt out of the room and\nDoug grabs me and I'm just following\nthem right so we race out of boft Hall\nit's maybe 4 in the morning 3:30 4 in\nthe morning we race out of boft Hall the\nbarracks we run across the parking lot\ninto Lun Hall in Lun Hall is the\nswimming facility and the wrestling\nroom that's it that's the only thing\nthat's in there right the doors we run\nup to Lun Hall the doors of Jun Hall are\nlocked with a chain on the outside and\none of our Doug pulls on the Chain so\nthat the do open enough at the top that\nthe 142 pounder can climb up and like\nget inside that little Gap in the doors\nand run over and open one of the doors\nthat isn't chained this is what you'll\nlater do professionally I still have\nexactly and what I frankly did as a kid\nlike back in the day and so I'm\nterrified cuz I don't know what's coming\nyou know and so you don't bother to ask\nwhat are we doing there's no time\nthere's just no time like these guys are\nto me they're full-blown war heroes\nthey're not they're college kids but I'm\n17 they're 21 all these wrestlers I'm\nhoping I'm going to come here and be\ntheir teammate you know we run into Lun\nHall go to the Second Story we climb up\nthe utility ladder where Public Works\ngoes to get in the ceiling\nabove the white foamy ceiling tile\nthings so we're now on the catwalk where\nthe HVAC guys would be working\nand I'm starting to get a sense of\nwhat's\ncoming we go a couple feet down the\ncatwalk everyone\nstops someone reaches over the catwalk\nand pulls one chalky ceiling tile out so\nnow you can look over the edge of the\ncatwalk and see right through the\nceiling into the diving well remember\nthe diving well has a 10 meter platform\nand then we're another I don't want to\nOV exaggerate this we have to be another\n20 feet into the ceiling so you're above\nthe diving board what most people we're\nway above the diving board okay we're 5T\nabove the ceiling which is 20t above the\n10 meter got it right and so um and now\nI've realize what's happening and two or\nthree wrestlers they sort you climb over\nthe catwalk get you know backwards get\nyour hands all the way down and then\nvery lower yourself in a reverse pullup\nso you\ndon't kick the SE in\ntile and three or four guys go and you\ncan hear them hit the water after what\nis a terrifyingly long time when you're\nyou know my age and SC in the dark oh\nyeah no one's supposed to be in there\num and then one of the guys looks over\nwhen you're a recruit you're called a\ndrag they're like drag you're up and I'm\nlowering myself Andrew and I kick the\nadjacent ceiling tile and it hits the\ndive tank and it turns into pancake\nbatter and goes to the bottom of the\npool oh my and one of my teammates is\nlike you\n one of my future teammates\nyou know he's going nuts I drop I\nlive and this is back to\nDoug I come up Doug clearly goes behind\nme but I don't hear\nhim and one or two guys are going nuts\nyou high school piece of like\nyou're going to go down to the 15 ft and\npick it all up and Doug comes up and he\njust blasts\neverybody he's our\nresponsibility this is not his fault we\nbrought him here like just totally backs\nme\nup and then the rest of the visit\nhappens I end up there Dougs no senior\nI'm a\nfreshman\nand he's just the legend he was all\nAmerican and to this day Andrew you need\nto hear this loud and clear like for all\nthe people you and I both know and the\npeople I've been around no other human\nin my life have I met with his physical\nand mental toughness not even close the\nguy was born in the wrong century is the\nway I describe\nhim and he\nwas like my mentor and he was my guy you\nknow and uh he was killed in'\n07 Marine mhm yeah we we'll talk about\nDoug you've written about him yeah he's\nunbelievable I feel like I know him a\nlittle bit thanks to you we'll get\naround to that uh for sure I think\npeople are getting a sense of where\nwe're headed so that's the that to\nanswer your question about like that the\nbigness of the Naval Academy that's how\nit started for me like everything was\njust on steroids you know all these kind\nof\npeople I get the impression at least up\nuntil now that you're kind of just you\njust go with what's right in front of\nyou 100% like there there isn't a lot of\npause and reflect although your R your\nRudder is not halfhazard it's not random\nno well yeah I can say right now you and\nI as similar as I you know we may be in\ncertain respects like we're very\ndifferent in this way like there isn't a\nthere isn't like a foraging you know in\nbiology we call them random walks you\nknow a lot a lot of organization that\ncomes out of biology is through random\nWalks Like animal or human like finds a\nnode and moves and and life is like that\nSteve Jobs talked about not being able\nto connect the dots except retrospect\nand and I subscrib to that and his life\nwas a bit of a random walk but that we\nGuided by some Central beam of of\nuniqueness uh Robert Green was when he\nwas on the podcast talks about that your\nbeam is is um more narrow it seems\nnarrow and the propeller behind that\nbeam is uh high RPM yes that's very\nclear and what I'm not hearing here is\nlike um yeah you know at one point I\npaused and wondered whether or not I\nwanted to you know be here wrestling in\nthe Naval Academy or or even like what I\nmight do when I get out am I going to\nwork for an investment firm what am I\ngoing to do you're re Your Horizon it\nseems to be about 24 hours at that point\nyeah I hope not anymore but at that\npoint at that at that point I'm no\npsychologist but but um but it just\nseems like you're uh it's not like\nyou're playing checkers but you're\nyou're optimizing for a fairly um short\nHorizon there's no question that's right\nand the other part that was probably the\nmost important to me Andrew was the the\nperson or the group mhm because this is\ngoing to sound very arrogant but when I\ngot to I'm going to this prep school I'm\ngoing to Naval Academy I think on day\none I'm going to literally meet the\ncream of the crop in the country and\nthat was not the case and it was not the\ncase at the Naval Academy and frankly it\nwasn't the case in the teams either like\nI'm not saying I'm better than anybody\nbut I thought every single person when I\ngot to the Naval Academy was going to\nentirely focused on whatever our mission\nwas and I didn't even know what my\nmission was there right I just knew I\nwas going to be told what Wright looks\nlike and Doug not only did I meet him in\nhigh school and have the the luck of\nhaving him as a teammate and a mentor\nfor me he is what Wright looked like so\na focused beam and a propeller running\nat high RPM with the right you know\nquote unquote swim buddy so to speak was\nliterally all I cared about that was it\neverything else was White Noise were\nthere other interests at the time I mean\npresumably you listen to music every\nonce in a while but I mean I would\nwhatever but didn't fall in love with it\ndidn't feel the need to pursue anything\nelse learn an instrument do anything\nelse it was it was it was a that was it\nit was that that narrow beam\nso you met your wife in 96 sophomore\nyear at the Naval Academy yep uh and was\nshe as driven is she as driven I mean\nshe's obviously a very talented swimmer\npresumably works hard as well um it's\nkind of interesting I didn't um realize\nuntil a few years ago that the both of\nyou were you know military yeah she\ndefinitely just different different\ndriven way smarter way\nmore you know it's obviously not one to\none for men and women but way more\nsuccessful\nby gradient standards she's in the Navy\nHall of Fame she was Patriot League\nswimming champ she was on Junior\nNational trath on team when she was 20 I\nthink\num really talented in every regard um\nninth in our class I think first female\ngraduate number one female graduate our\nclass tell me more about that how's it\nhow's that work you have a I don't even\nknow exactly how the grading first of\nall her grades are her academic success\nis just\nremarkable and then you get a military\ngrade and you get a physical grade not\nfor your Athletics I don't think but\nit's like your PR RT scores which is\nyour physical Readiness test all this\nmilitary stuff you do you get this other\ncluster of a grade that goes along with\nyour academic\ngrades and she was number nine in the\nclass and the first female graduate\nbased on that cluster of\ngrading and I mean she's an amazing\nperson was her success in academics and\nswimming was that part of what Drew you\nto her uh no no no and she was just nice\nand you know I I didn't really care\nabout the achievement it doesn't it\ncertainly sounds like I care about\nachievement because of the narrow Focus\nbut it it wasn't really that you know\nshe was just really normal in a group of\na lot of abnormal people frankly like\nthere's some Cooks at these schools you\nknow um and I'm probably in that\ncategory I don't know but everybody's\njust really different there you have\nthis athlete group you have I mean you\nknow Andrew I mean you you went to\nStanford I mean some of the you know the\ngroup of Naval Academy and West Point\nlike these schools who produce like the\nroad scholar level person like that\ncluster of group like at Navy I remember\nthey're super impressive I mean and then\nthere's the rest of us like doing our\nbest getting pretty good grades and\nstuff but there's very different groups\ninside you know the school yeah yeah I\nlooked at some of my colleagues like a\nformer guest on this podcast Ali crumb\nyou know she's incredible scientist was\na division one gymnast\nand uh is a licensed clinical\npsychologist also maintains a a healthy\nrelationship with with children in the\nhome like I just go who are these people\nyou know it's I mean you know every once\nin a while we talk about the the person\nwith the quote unquote extra gear you\nknow like some people just seem to have\nthat extra gear and I don't want to take\nanything away from Ally or anyone else's\num incredible work ethic that goes with\nwhat people perceive as an extra gear\nwho knows if they have an extra gear or\nnot uh I always just want to know what\ntheir parents did yeah and it out\nAllie's parents I hope I have this right\nuh but recollection of this is that um\nher mother ran a theater group and her\nfather was a martial arts teacher okay\nso you know there's nothing that speaks\nto academics per se and and I find that\nreally important to me and to highlight\nbecause I think people hearing this\nconversation and hear about people like\nalleys and other examples like that you\nthink oh yeah you got to come from an\nacademic family to end up at a at a top\ntier institution or or to win a Nobel\nPrize in fact there there are so many\nexceptions to that or you have to um be\na natural athlete um or be born with\nsome some genetic gift or or or some\nextra gear as it were in order to\nsucceed but I think so much of success\nis the thing that you seem to\noperationalize really quickly which is\num to really focus on that 24-hour\nHorizon and where one has seen failure\nto just keep going I mean a big part of\nit is just to keep going but also to\nmake make sure that you're continuing to\ngo um in a direction that is adaptive\nand functional because imagine had you\nnot found wrestling and you had gotten\ninto some you know some group where the\nthe the metrics of success were around\nyou know dealing weed or doing something\nwhich back then was highly illegal now\nis very varying levels of legality but\nyou know where that where the points\ncame back for effort in domains of life\nthat could take you down into the gutter\nand and you see this so I'm I'm\nconvinced that the work ethic is is the\nfundamental piece but there has to be\nthat Rudder and your Rudder has to be\npointed in the right direction so along\nthose lines you meet Bridget yeah and\nwas it instantaneous no we kind of had a\nfriendship first I felt like at least\nwe've discussed this I mean I\ninstantaneously enjoyed her company so I\nmet Bridget in February of sophomore\nyear I was on the campus of Naval\nAcademy is called the yard I was on the\nyard all winter because the wrestling\nseason is in the shittiest time ever\nright it crosses over the holidays you\nhave to make weight during Thanksgiving\nyou have to make weight during\nChristmas we were on campus on the\nyard and it was easily waste deep snow\nand we were doing two a day practices\neverybody else is home on\nvacation that winter I considered\nleaving and thank goodness for no cell\nphones and stuff because I didn't know\nhow to leave I was like you consider\nleaving like leaving the ne leaving the\nI was just but it didn't have anything\nto do with the na Academy really it had\neverything to do with that moment I was\nmiserable like I was making I wrestled\n190 my freshman year and Doug\ngraduated he was the 177 pounder so\nsophomore yard dropped into his spot I\nwent down to\n177 fighting weight for me is like\n193 but you know back then Andrew\nlifting a lot I was 210 to 215 in the\noff season and I cut to 177 sophomore\nyear and I was just really miserable and\num if it was easy to leave I probably\nwould have and then I met Bridget in\nFebruary and I was like it I'll\nstay she's better than this place\nanyway having followed my high school\ngirlfriend off to college and not gone\nto college when I got there I just lived\nin the parking lot outside her dorm room\nI I can relate you know there's a uh I\nprobably wouldn't be sitting here today\nwere not for for elany I'd like to take\na quick break and acknowledge one of our\nsponsors plunge plunge makes what I\nbelieve is the best self-cooling cold\nwater plunge over the last decade and\nespecially in The Last 5 Years there's\nbeen an increasing amount of excitement\nabout cold water plunging for a sake of\nmental health physical health and\nperformance and that's in large part\nbecause one of the most robust effects\nof cold water exposure are big increases\nin Adrenaline also called epinephrine\nand dopamine so while some people do\ncold water plunging in pursuit of\nincreasing metabolism or reducing\ninflammation it's it's really those big\nincreases in Adrenaline and dopamine\nthat lead to those long lasting\nincreases in alertness and feelings of\nwell-being not just in the seconds or\nminutes after the cold plunge but indeed\nfor several hours afterwards I've been\nusing a plunge for several years now\ntypically first thing in the morning or\nafter cardiovascular training I do agree\nthat doing cold water plunging after a\nworkout designed to generate hypertrophy\nor strength gains is not a good idea but\ndoing cold plunging at the other times\nof day can be tremendously beneficial I\nuse the version of plunge called the\nAllin ice bath and plunge now also makes\nsaunas that get up to 230° F I love how\nthe plunge ice bath and sauna can both\nbe controlled from an app on my phone so\nthat if I'm headed home I can turn on\nthe sauna and it'll be hot when I arrive\nso if you would like to try a plunge ice\nbath or SAA you can go to plunge. comom\nhuberman to get $150 off either product\nagain that's plunge. comom\nhuberman so at what point did you decide\nyou wanted to aim for the SEAL Teams is\na great question I mean things you know\nas compared\nto at a Gunnery Sergeant in the Marine\nCorp at Prep School who I thought these\nare back to the first people you meet in\nthis environment gunny Flynn and he was\ngreat like he was super hard on us but I\nobviously kind of love that and I\nthought I was going to go into the\nMarine Corps and Doug wanted to go into\nthe Marine Core I'm a freshman at the\nNaval Academy he's my wrestling partner\nDoug could literally tell me to jump off\nof a building his as long as he came\nwith me I'd do it no problem and enjoy\nit all the way down Doug was going into\nthe Marine Corps I thought I was going\nto go into the Marine Corps and I did a\nsummer training in quanico between\nfreshman and sophomore year and it was\nokay it was good but I didn't love it\nand I met a couple other guys who were\ngoing to compete for spots in the SEAL\nTeams who were years ahead of me but to\nanswer your question junior year you get\nyou can sign up and say I want to start\ncompeting for a Billet we had 16 spots\nin my class I think there's 32 spots\nthese\ndays you know the force has grown since\n911 obviously and\num and I I want to say maybe 150 or so\npeople they put you through this weekend\novernight two-day hell two-day things at\nNavy some people quit I don't know how\nmany go to what we used to call Mini\nbuds in the summer between Junior and\nSenior year you go out to Coronado and\nbuds instructors they still have it it's\ncalled something\ndifferent um you spend two weeks at the\nbuds compound and they run you through a\nmini program and so find buds for the\nsome some folks listening to this won't\nknow won't know the acronym the acronym\nis basic underwater demolition seal\nschool that's our school in Coronado\nscreen process for who gets in who\ndoesn't yeah and when you're at when\nyou're at the Naval Academy it's\nobviously different than guys coming\ninto the listed ranks you have this pool\nof people 150ish guys say they want to\ngo sometime junior year they run you\nthrough this weekend pretty hard at\nNavy because we have seals station at\nthe Naval Academy and then I'm just\ngoing to guess that goes from 150 to 80\nmaybe 80 guys go to the summer program\nin Coronado when you're still you know a\nmidshipman at the Naval\nAcademy I've never maybe people have\nquit mini buds I don't know but I don't\nknow if I really saw anybody quit the\ntwo weeks we're out in Coronado and then\nyou get you know graded on your\nperformance and stuff and then you come\nback for senior year and you go through\na series of interviews with a bunch of\nseals Who come out and do interviews and\nyou don't really know what you're\ndoing and then they select down I don't\nwant to again overdo it but it's\nprobably seven I don't know maybe 50 or\n60 qualified guys they select you down\nto\n16 and so to answer your question about\nwhen I got interested was when I knew I\ndidn't want to go in the Marine Corps I\nnever ever had the Top Gun Fever thing I\nwasn't interested in flying\nI just wasn't interested in anything\nelse but something super\nphysical and that seemed like the best\nthe next best thing and because I grew\nup in New Orleans and spent a lot of\ntime in the water that wasn't\nintimidating that screens a lot of\npeople out\nobviously yeah and got selected in the\ngroup of 16\nand was at buds after graduation you\nknow a couple months after\ngraduation there's been a lot put out\ninto the world around buds you know\npeople have seen the log carrying and\nboat carrying and the screaming and the\nset set screaming of the the uh\ninstructors and the and the running and\nthe you know clasped arms in the in the\nwater and hell week no sleep and on and\non it's obviously tough it it calls 85%\nof the people that go out there thinking\nthat they are the the absolute last\nperson who would ever quit ring the bell\nso to speak\num you obviously got through uh a while\nback you mentioned to me three things\nthat you think predict whether or not\nsomebody's going to get through Buds and\num before you tell us what these are I\njust will just uh tell people that yes\nof course you made it through buds\nsuccessfully and went into the teams um\nvery successful career in the teams but\nyou've also been a buds instructor so\nyou've been on the on the um on the\nother side of the equation too what are\nthose three things yeah this was as you\nknow this was very anecdotal but it\nlined\nup we when I was back there in ' 05 as\nan instructor Andrew I feel like we're\nnot scientists right but I feel like we\ntried every\ncorrelating data pull that we could pull\nfrom pull-ups to runtimes to you name it\nto regions of the country that people\ngrow up near\nwater at least back then nothing\ncorrelated and so I was a first phase\nOIC officer in charge and so our team in\nfirst phase we can talk about what that\nis in detail if you want to but first\nphase isn't charge of hell week you know\nhell week's in the first two months of\ntraining and a couple of the guys said\nall this about this can get you\nthrough that can get you through I\nbet that every single person we talk to\nout here on the grinder has one of these\nthree things they were a varsity athlete\nin high school or college their parents\nare divorced or they got suspended from\nschool I guarantee it and we would walk\naround the grinder and ask and I\nmean you know this isn't going to pass\nit independent review board but it's got\nto be 90 to 95% so that's incredible\nbecause you know so much has been made\nof buds and hell week and just to just\nfill in a few of the blanks for those\nthat aren't familiar hell week is what\nit's uh five nights no sleep you get an\nhour a couple minutes on on one day but\nyou're basically in constant movement\nfor about a week are and that's when\nmost people voluntarily ring the bell\nand most of them do it before Wednesday\nokay and I know it's got chaotic\ncomponents going off blast it's got hard\nwork boring components people the the\npeople trying to make it through have no\nsense of how long a run is going to last\nor what's going to happen and you hear\nall this stuff like okay you just don't\nquit or you just go meal to meal but\nwhat you just described is really\ninteresting uh let's break those three\nthings down because um playing a varc\nsport has certain elements\num having divorced parents has certain\nelements and getting sus spended in\nschool has certain\nelements let's start\nwith divorced parents first because\nVarsity Sport I think we can probably\njust quickly say okay there's structure\nyou have to listen to somebody you have\nto be able to push yourself you have to\nhave some level of physical competence\ncoachable mental competence work with\nothers so there's something there right\num and you presumably have to go through\nJunior varc to get there so there's some\noomph and required um in any event um\nbut the divorce parents pieces is was\nsurprising to me still is what you have\ndivorced parents so do I divorces occur\nfor any number of different reasons what\nin the world do you think is the uh the\nconsequence of or the of a divorced\nhousehold that would predict so well at\nleast in this back of the envelope\nmeasurement that you made but as an\ninstructor that people would get through\nthis excruciatingly difficult period of\ntime for me it was one\nthing\nspecifically I felt like I was\nalone if I didn't have the\nteam so I don't know what it would be\nfor other people but I was like if I\ndon't have this\nteam then what team do I\nhave so I'm not leaving you could crank\nup the cold and misery as high as you\nwant but I'm not leaving yeah that hits\ndeep um I didn't do buds I didn't even\nknow what the Seal team was were but I\ncertainly know the the feeling of um\nlooking outside of the household for uh\na sense of family and belonging and the\nfeeling that like I'd much rather like\nfrom almost from a place of Joy like I'd\nmuch rather die for these people\nhopefully not with these people but much\nrather die trying to save others and to\ndo well in that than to quit yeah yeah\nthat's that's a powerful thing that you\njust shine light on I don't think of the\nhundreds of interviews with Team guys\nex- Team guys buds instructors Etc that\nare out there I don't think anyone's\never highlighted that I don't think I\nwas aware of it then Andrew but I just\nyou know again it's in it's in\nretrospect well the retrospect is in\nlarge part what we're here for um to go\na little deeper on that I think that a\nlot of people have challenging homes the\nparents aren't necessarily divorced and\nwe're talk Talking of course about um\ntrying to understand the the human\nSpirit uh certainly not accomplishments\nper se but the human spirit so I think\nthat a lot of people especially nowadays\nthey look to their home life and if you\nknow God willing they had a great home\nlife that is the base it's like the it's\nlike the Touchstone for them that they\ncan return to but for a lot of people\neven people who go home for the holidays\nor who touch in with their parents\nwhether or not they're divorced or not\nthat they don't feel like that family\nunit is really a a solid thing maybe\nthey're in a place I see this a lot of\nwhere like they're the parent they had\nto grow up taking care of the parents I\nsee that a lot on both the male side and\nthe female side I see that um\nso you're saying that one strong\npredictor of getting through is a\nfeeling of people want essentially\nmaking it their like almost like\nbiological identity to get through it\nwas certainly the case for me I mean\nwhen I got and again I don't really like\nto overdo these things because it tends\nto feed the Mythos a\nlittle but when I got to buds Andrew\nlike I when I got to the Naval Academy I\nhad a very strong sense of this is my\nchance and you know you develop over the\nyears and you spend time thinking about\nthis and having mentors when I got there\nthat was very much my first time\nof you better bring the nastiest on\nthe planet because I'm not leaving here\nlike it's just not I'm not I'm just not\ngoing you know and there's a Navy bit to\nit too like I didn't want to do anything\nelse in the Navy so back to fear I was\nafraid I would get stuck doing a job I\ndidn't like but there's some people are\nnot wrong you know about buds there's\nsome very difficult days where you do\nstart to wonder like is this really\nworth it and I and that I never once\nthought about quitting it never crossed\nmy mind because I just had these other\nthings that I really had to do for\nmyself in my life or else I felt like I\nwas going to have\nnothing and so again I don't think\noperating out of fear is particularly\nadaptive but sometimes it you know the\nbit in your teeth is\nuseful yeah certainly in my own life I\ncould say you know getting real scared\nabout being 19 and essentially realizing\nI'm not good at anything I'm not good at\nanything and I was terrible at a lot of\nthings and some of those things were\ntaking me down a dangerous path that\nthat was the fear I'm grateful for the\nfear piece it it would it it scruffed me\nand uh let's talk about the suspended in\nschool yep um he's uh first of all that\nimplies getting caught yes not just\nmisbehaving but getting caught um yeah\nwhat do you think that's about so we're\nreally talking about a sense of\nrebellion against Authority or the\nsystem that one finds themselves in\nwhich is super important for our line of\nwork like for me again I can only speak\nfor myself for me it was the wild\nyou Factor like you have to there's just\na nasty reality of the work we had to do\nyou know I was in from 98 until 2011 in\nthe seal teams in the SEAL Teams from 98\nuntil 2011 everybody knows what was\nhappening between 911 and then um it's\nnot that it didn't stop happening I know\nyou know from my own experience from 03\nthrough 2010 was extremely intense and\num\nobviously the military has rules and we\nneed rules and you follow the laws of\nonc conflict and you follow the rules of\nengagement there's no question about\nthat\never\num but the that happens to you out\nin the field for real does not follow\nany pattern and so if you are a complete\nyou know nonsuspended from school rule\nfollower I'm not saying you won't be\nsuccessful I'm sure plenty of people are\nbut in our line of work if you ask\npeople most of them had a weird streak\nas they were coming up like they have a\nlittle bit of a a side eye when somebody\ntells them this is how stuff is like\nmaybe it's like that but you don't know\nthat and where it really became clear\nfor me Andrew was look at every stage in\nyour development you're still looking\nfor what right looks like and when I was\na I'm now a Naval Academy graduate not\nthat that means anything special but I'm\nsmart enough I'm now in my 20s I'm at\nBuds\nand I have this recollection later like\nyou people are always telling stories\nabout the teams and when you're a new\nstudent at buds you're you kind of\nbelieve everything the instructors tell\nyou because it's pretty impressive\nand then you find out later when you\nwhen I checked into Seal Team 3 and you\nactually start to understand the Arc of\nthe job it's like all these guys were\ntelling training stories those weren't\nreal Combat stories those they they\nnever said that that was a story from\ntraining and so my point is\nlike what what you I hope guys are\ngetting it now but what we didn't get a\nlot of was the real story in a sense\nmeaning I will say definitively my first\ncombat deployment was 03 when we invaded\nIraq I was a platoon Commander we\ninvaded Iraq and I remember within a\nweek of being in that situation thinking\nnot one single instructor had the\nexperience to mentor and Coach me on\nthis not one and so you have to go back\nto that wild\nsuspended you factor mindset like\nall your silly rules about how the\nmilitary Works none of that shit's\nhappening out here like all this other\nstuff is happening that doesn't have\nanything to do with your training\nmanuals except for the things you don't\nviolate which is to your best of your\nability stuff happens but the rules of\nengage the laws of armed conflict\neverything else is a tossup the tactics\naren't that's not a tossup but you know\nwhat I mean like the environment is it\ncompletely\nchaotic it's a new sport it's a brand\nnew sport that no one coached you on and\nand it's highrisk high consequence for\nyou and your teammates but also for the\nother side I mean\nevery 15 seconds is a new consequential\ndecision yeah because you obviously\ndon't want to kill civilians on the\nother side either of course not\nyeah so you obviously get through\nbuds you probably weren't surprised\ngiven your mindset probably weren't\nsurprised no no I wasn't surprised at\nthis point I'm maybe building a little\nself-confidence and just operate out of\nfear but happy presumably oh yeah yep\nand I feel obligated to ask well I'm\njust curious to ask that you you know\nyou've been in a system of military for\na long time is there a a bigger um poll\nof patriotism there or that's just it's\nthere but I mean are you thinking about\ncountry or are you thinking about team\nyou think about the day yeah I mean at\nthis point you know I'm fully\nindoctrinated in a sense you know the\nNaval Academy really does give you a\nsense of again bigness and you meet\npeople from World War II and Vietnam and\nyou know an amazing guy which you know\nwe can cover later I don't I wasn't\naround when he was coming up but Colonel\nJohn Ripley is a guy who won the Navy\ncross in Vietnam um the book The the\nbridge of donga is about him he knew my\nthis is back to I was my Uncle Jim who\nintroduc he and my Uncle Jim were\nbuddies and I met him he's since passed\naway I met Colonel Ripley when I was a\nple at the Naval Academy um I work with\none of his sons now friend teammate\nMentor is a great\nguy um colonel Ripley he's a legend like\nthis guy's a Navy cross winner should\nhave won the Congressional Medal of\nHonor by all accounts if you read the B\nthe book to Bridget dong High you you\nare going to have no ability to\nunderstand why he's not dead and these\nare the kind of people you meet so back\nto the patriotism you know Thing by the\ntime I was in the teams I I knew where I\nwas sort of in this\necosystem admittedly though what I\ndidn't really have Andrew because it I\nmean I love the country of course but it\nwasn't again I didn't grow up with a dad\nwho was like you know this was always in\nour house or just wasn't that big of a\nthing this this came for me after 911\nobviously but yes the patriotism and the\nimportance of the jobs there but what\nwhen I remember checking in Seal Team 3\nwhat what emerged very quickly for me\nbecause we had Vietnam vets in the\ntraining cell at se team 3 and just some\namazing\npeople what I realized away was okay\nplaytime is completely\nover and that was very useful like early\nlesson not that anyone was\naround in buds like you know it's\nserious but you meet a guy like Master\nChief Martin who's got 100 combat\nmissions from Vietnam he's about to\nretire he was like the third person I\nmet when I checked into the team and you\nsuddenly are like a kid again\nwhere there was just no\naround so you're in the teams presumably\nliking the work loved it loving the team\ncomponent it's hard it's\nunpredictable and that's part of the the\nfun it's amazing yeah the job's\namazing you do a number of different\ndeployments MH and at some point you get\ncalled to try out for the tier one uh\ntier one division within the within the\nSEAL Teams um maybe just explain a\nlittle bit of what tier one means um and\nyou know we don't want to speak in code\nhere but we you know just inform people\nthat there are levels within the teams\num and that uh yeah tell us what tier\none is yeah well I'll just refer to a\nspecial Mission Unit it's probably the\neasiest um we have a bunch of teams on\nthe east and west coast as a lot of\npeople know nowadays this was not\npublic knowledge years ago yeah so so\nyou've got the these different units\nwithin within the SEAL Teams yeah so you\nyou have to raise your hand you know I\nwas 10 years in Andrew I was at I had\nhad been platoon Commander during the\ninvasion of Iraq we came to Monterey I\nwent to school and went back to be a\nbudge instructor it was 10 years I felt\nlike it was time to you know take my\nshot it's a little risky because it's\nhard to make it through you know Green\nTeam and stuff at the at the special\nMission Unit it's a 9month Advanced\nTraining Program you're 10 years into\nyour career you're not 22 anymore and\nnot everyone gets called The Green Team\nnot everyone can go you can't say I want\nto go I want to try out you can say you\nwant to try out and you do a\npre-screener okay so the command\ntraining staff I'll call it the command\nfor purposes of this conversation\nbecause I'm familiar with that term for\nus the command training staff comes out\nthey put you through all this stuff some\nof it's psychological some of it's\nphysiological I don't think we did a\nblood test but they checked the trainers\nchecked everything on me um which I\nthought this is actually a description\nof why the units tier one I was even in\nthe pre-screening it was the first time\nthe way I joke about it is like I really\nfelt like I was doing what was in the\nbrochure like it was real varsity stuff\nyou\nknow I'm presaging a later conversation\nthat we'll get to but um at this point\nHave you ever sat down with a\npsychologist and done a therapy session\nthat was no therapy but I sat down with\npsychologist because they put us through\nthe battery the neop The Raven stuff\nlike that they're asking you how do you\nsleep at night how do you feel what do\nyou dream about how much do you drink\nand you say two beers a week and and\nyou're lying everyone L yeah but now it\nmight be two beers a week now it's zero\nzero right um but yeah so it was good\nscreening process like I was like oh\n these guys are not messing around\nthis is exactly what I wanted to do MH\nand the physical tests ramp up and uh\ncoincidentally I worked for him later\nstill friends with him now on my\ninterview board was uh bris Linsky who\nwon the Congressional Medal of Honor BR\nwas on my interview board and he's great\nguy and so yeah then you just wait and\nif you get picked up you go out you know\nto the east coast and you really rolling\nthe dice because I was on the west coast\nyou move your whole family sell your\nhouse you mean have to sell your house\nbut we did and you move and you're going\nto\ndo a 9month advanced training program at\nthe command just to get into a Tactical\nUnit you know which we call squadrons\nand the best way tactically for me to\ndescribe the difference and look my time\nat Team three was amazing I'm not\ndiminishing it but let me just use freef\nfall military freef fall for anybody\nwho's you know even done civilian free\nfall so it's jumping out of place\njumping yeah so if you go if we go to\nthe Drop Zone and we go jumping right\nFAA regulations have you jump at 12,999\nFT CU soon as you go above 13,000 you\nhave to use supplemental oxygen which is\nnot a huge deal but it's a pain in the\nass for the airplane to have it and\nso 99% of your jump all your jumps well\nat any standard Drop Zone your civilian\njumps are going to be below 13 Grand for\nall of our jumping at Seal Team 3 is\nbelow 13 Grand it just makes the\ntraining more efficient and you'll jump\nduring the daytime maybe a little night\njumping you probably have some lights\nfor\nsafety um and if you look out of the\nairplane you would be able to see the\norange te on the drop zone right that's\nyour standard jump profile maybe you'll\njump with some weight you'll certainly\njump with your weapon probably your\nhelmet but not all your jumps because\nyou're bringing guys from zero to be\nable to do tactical military freef fall\nas a\ngroup when you go to the\ncommand your jumps\nare from 25,000 ft you do 30 minutes of\npre-breathing on oxygen helmet night\nvision zero lights and a attack board\nthat has your navigation system on it\n100 pounds of gear your weapon your\noxygen all your and 45 dudes piled\nup in a\nc17 and you drop miles away from the\nDrop Zone because you're over ground\nspeed at 25,000 ft is hauling ass you\nknow because of the wind and if you take\nyour hands out of your gloves at 25,000\nfeet it's curtains like you're not going\nto be able to use your fingers cuz it's\nso cold and you jump from way away\nobviously and all your jump is\ncompletely blacked out everybody turns\nIR lights on their helmets and INF\ninfrared lights so you can see through\nnight vision um and you got to fly that\ncanopy multiple multiple miles and land\neverybody on a drop zone you know that's\nif you take every tactical thing we\ndo and\nexpand the same way you would expand\nfreef fall that's the difference at the\ncommand which is look I was I want to\nown this when I was at Team three\nbecause you think about this I had many\nmany moments where I was thinking ah\n it man those guys aren't that much\ndifferent like we're we're super highend\nright and we\nare and then when I got there I was like\nthis is this is another level what what\npercentage of people that go to Green\nTeam get through and get S uh I think I\nhad had 65 in my class you don't drop\nthat many maybe 10 guys didn't make it\nor something maybe\n15ish so then you were why do they call\nit tier one no idea it must have some\nofficial reason like because if you go\ninto like real documentation Andrew like\nthere's there there's echelons in you\nknow this this command is ech on this\nthis command is echel on this and the\nmilitary Congress sets end strength\nnumbers it's says the Navy you get at\nthe one time CU I took some class the\nNavy had like 355,000 people and that's\nthe Navy's end strength and they have to\ndistribute those numbers across\neverybody in the Navy so I don't know\nwhy it's called tier one but I think it\nhas a you know has a reason so you got\nthrough M you were accepted and then\nyou're doing very different sorts of\nthings than you were doing previously\nvery so my understanding is this is\nlargely counterterror\nwork um so all the work in the military\nand SEAL Teams is high-risk High\nconsequence but now it's Special\nOperations as as the name\num implies um where things have to be\nworked out on a on a case-by Case basis\nit's highly unusual it was unusual\nbefore but now it's highly unusual\ncircumstances um what was it like to be\nthere did you like that family I loved\nit it was the best place to work MH um\nand this is 200 this is 06 through 2011\nfor me okay so it's post 911 uh through\n2011 yep okay\nso I'm sure a lot happened and most of\nwhich we can't and won't discuss um and\nthat's not what's important here yeah um\nbut clearly you met and worked with some\namazing individuals\num I happen to know because we've uh\nspoken before and we have some common\nfriends in in the in the that Arena that\num you had both the privilege of doing\nthis work in this really important\nwartime but also um the unfortunate\nexperience of of being close to and\nworking with uh quite a lot of people\nthat uh were killed yep um how many so I\nmean I don't know why I did this or why\nanyone does it\nit it's way over 40 but I try not\nto over affiliate myself with a larger\ngroup than I actually\nknew but the people that I personally\nknew Andrew it's exactly\n40 and um and we could spend probably\nweeks detailing how impressive uh each\nand every one of those people was in\ntheir individual cases this is perhaps a\nan opportunity to um put a call out\nthere's a a wonderful book I think an\nimportant book that isn't so well known\nin the in the array of quote unquote\nmilitary and seal books um which is the\nbook about Adam Brown Yeah The Fearless\nbook I heard they're going to make it\ninto a movie but but what I um what I\nlike about the book is um actually has\nvery little to do with the SEAL Teams\ntotally that's thing is that Adam um had\na serious serious problem with addiction\nthat he masked at times and it came back\nto pull him under various times while he\nwas in the teams and um I know you\nworked with Adam and you're close my\ngreen team yeah yeah so um that's a\ngreat book for anyone that wants a a\ndifferent sort of book um it's really\nabout addiction and family and his\ndiscovery of the path out of all that\nhis tenacity is incredible awesome\nawesome book and human about an awesome\nawesome human um so you do those years\num and then you\nknow what happens when you know 40\npeople close to you die uh I have to\nimagine involves a you get pretty good\nunfortunately\nat taking what each and every one of\nthose is a tragedy and and just\ncontinuing yeah so um let's just talk\nabout that for a bit if if you're\nwilling yep so um guys are getting shot\nand blown up and you're close with them\nto to say the least\nand what was your role in the in the\naftermath like like how what do you do\nyou you you go to a funeral you you you\num toast a few beers and then you go\nback to work I mean it's that's kind of\nyou know in the most simplistic terms\nAndrew that is exactly what happens\num there's obviously you know a lot more\nthat goes on\nbut if you script the diary so to\nspeak it's it wasn't you know a funeral\nevery 3 months but on average if I\naveraged out because I've done this in\nyou know\nExcavating the last few years we were at\na funeral or Memorial effectively every\n90 days and um in that time\nperiod but it wasn't obviously you know\nthat simple like for for me and our\nfamily Doug was my first super close\nteammate killed and it wasn't in the\nteams right I'm now at the command I was\nback from Afghanistan from Kandahar this\nis way before the Marines built up 100\nkilometers west of Kandahar we were\noperating six of us with like 180\nAfghans kind of the wild west back then\nand Doug was killed that summer of ' 07\nand and I got a phone call from a friend\nI was standing in my kitchen in Virginia\nBeach and it was\nlike like the whole scaffolding of the\nworld was just\ngone because at that age and here I am\nlike I'm some kid I was in my I was in\nmy 30s but I'm\nthinking you know things get more and\nmore serious as you go like at that time\nbut when Doug was\nkilled and I was a Paul Bear in his\nfuneral and you know we came up to\nAnapolis he was living in Anapolis cuz\nhe was working it's it's now been\npublicly released which is nice for Pam\nbecause she can talk about it more he\nwas working at the\nagency and\num when after his funeral and just the\ndays around that and then I go back to\nwork and what I mentioned earlier about\nDoug and what I knew about him just as\nan operator he had been a company\ncommander in fujia he was on the front\npage of the LA Times like Tony Perry is\na reporter in San Diego he was in fuia\nfollowing Doug the guy was and Doug is\nnot a like a public people people just\nattracted to him to tell his story um I\nhave so many stories that I heard later\nfrom his bosses his regimental Commander\nyou know told stories about his unit in\nfuia his sergeant major and his amazing\nguy I've talked to him about like what\nwent on in fuia Doug is just a\nLegend I mean he was\nawesome and the dominant\nthought after his funeral was if things\nit's not that you don't think they're\nserious and I and I mean just about life\nAndrew it wasn't just about Combat\nAction and hard deployments it was about\nif Doug can be killed all bets\nare off they're all off like if I didn't\nrespect the rules before and didn't\nthink Society was particularly ordered\nin a way that I respected you know\nthat I think is made\nup I knew when Doug was K\nthat it's all made up like he\nwas supposed to\nbe the immortal\none and if he's not none of us are like\neverything has to be re-evaluated you\nknow how old was I was 32 and and you've\ngot kids at this point yeah yep um yeah\nolly wasn't born yet my youngest because\nyou you now have three boys yeah three\nboys 21 18 and 14 and um the older two\nwere born my my middle son was two at\nthe time and did it occur to you at the\npoint when Doug was killed or maybe some\nother point that you know at some point\nyou could die oh I mean that's what I\nmean Andrew like I you know personal\nwork and therapy afterwards it it was\nthen that I started looking over my\nshoulder just in general like everything\nwas\nsuddenly like has to be watched with a\nVigilant\neye something that um close friends\nclose male friends of mine have told me\num these are friends that are married\nwith kids um and I've heard this from\npeople that were in the military and and\nas well as those that weren't was that\nit was very important to them\nto marry somebody who were they to die\nthey knew their kids would be well taken\ncare of oh that one's not even there's\nno question about that yeah so um that\nthat was a like a primary criteria and I\nthink in your line of work I mean that\nthat must be especially important\nbecause the the probability of of dying\nis well let's face it is is much higher\nas as my uh sister who doesn't like\nsharks once told me she said you know\nthe best way to not get eaten by a shark\nis never go in the ocean you know there\nis a way to limiting probabilities\nshe'll swim in the ocean a little bit\nbut but the point being that when you're\nin the military and your your uh shoot\nmove and communicate is a big part of\nthe the job description and the uh the\nenemy is also taught to shoot move and\ncommunicate that there's there's a\ndecent probability that you could die so\num did you ever think okay well if I die\nmy kids are okay because Bridget's solid\nor were you still just operating on this\n24-hour schedule that you had adopted\nway back in the seventh grade no I think\nwell maybe I'd have to ask her that\nquestion\num I think I was backed away from the\n24-hour ledge a little bit MH I I knew\nthat the boys obviously would be taken\ncare of with my wife like that was never\neven had never crossed my mind probably\nuntil you just asked the question that\nwas almost just like table Stakes\nmhm\num back to this adaptive but maladaptive\nbehavior when Doug was killed I just\nrealized I had to work even\nharder to try to stay\nalive\nbecause if you met the guy there is I'm\ngoing to say it probably multiple there\nis not a human on the planet\nthat was as tough and as focused and as\nhyper dialed in to how to do the\njob 100%\neffectively as he was\nand it happened to him you know and it I\njust never it it's almost embarrassing\nand to say I never thought about it like\nthat until Doug was\nkilled and and yet and I'm not\nchallenging that at all of course uh I\nmean life circumstances the other team\ngets a vote too totally right I mean I\nmean somebody can be um seemingly\nindestructible oh so capable and\ntalented and get T-boned at an\nintersection and die right like like\nthat yeah we've known people like that\nall of us you know you hear these things\nthat's why they're called tragedies yeah\nwe just just like to put it in context\nwe have to remember is part of the\nbeauty of taking a young person and\ntaking all the ingredients that a person\ncomes into Special Operations pick your\nservice I'm not I'm agnostic I mean some\nof my best buddies are army and Marine\nCorps like I'm agnostic to the service\nhead is when you end up at a certain\npoint like and you look back you realize\nfor 10 or 15 years I've been\nindoctrinated in a very adaptive way to\nbelieve that I'm\nImmortal because if you\ndidn't you certainly wouldn't jump out\nof aircraft at 25,000 feet with no\nlights and you for hell for sure\nwouldn't go into some of these\ntowns we go into and end up in these\nfirefights like you have some\nweird I'll speak for myself I was\nentirely convinced that I couldn't be\nkilled and I I just because I was in\nsome way Andrew convinced that our\ntraining was so\ngood that that wouldn't happened to\nus let's take a step back for a second\nand acknowledge the the truth uh all\naround that set of statements which is\nthat um I think most people can think of\nthe government and the training programs\nas um honing the body but um it's\nprobably not lost on you at this point\nin your life that the you were you're a\nweapon your mind became a weapon right\nyour your body became a weapon um uh you\nwere a weapon of the military from the\ninside out and in the statement you just\nmade encapsulates that y um and that\nweapon honed itself for a long time but\nthen that's what the military is it\ncreates weapons and of out of humans and\nI'm not demonizing the military\nwhatsoever I want to be very clear I\nrealize that statement could be\nconstrued differently but um but that\nmindset encapsulates that so um so with\nthe other guys I want to make sure I\nfinish your question so it started with\nDoug and then you know I don't know what\ndirection you want to go here\nspecifically but then it just kept going\nAndrew right like at that time Doug was\n07 and then we went to Iraq in the\nwinter of 0708 which\nwas complete Mayhem and the troop was I\nmean my my troop in the winter of\n0708 were like\nsuperheroes and a guy named Tommy\nValentine was the troop Chief and we got\nhome and he was killed in a parachute\naccident after all that we went\nthrough Badger a guy named Mark Carter\nwas killed in that deployment we got\nhome and Tommy was killed in a parachute\naccident and me and a guy named Dutch we\nwent up to Minnesota to notify Tommy's\nparents and his sister and his\nbrother and we're not the Navy calls him\nKos like casualty assistance officers\nthese are jobs in the military where\nyou're trained to do this stuff you know\none of the things that's amazing about\nus is if a guy gets killed we send a\nteam guy there but think about the team\nguy like it's great for the family that\nyou send the team guy but we don't know\n about sitting with a family who's\nabout to be notified that their son in\nthis case of Tommy was killed Brit went\nto Christina's house lab Brit slinsky he\nwent to Christina's house and me and\nDutch went up to\nMinnesota\nand I'm shaking right now like I was\nshaking the whole drive we had to get to\nInternational Falls all way up North The\nValentines are incredible\npeople and I I mean notifying a family\nwas\njust it was brutal and so this is this\nis the this is'\n08 and then it just keeps coming it's\nNate and it's Mike and it's Lance and\nit's extortion in\n2011 and in the middle of that Adam gets\nkilled right like tons of people know\nabout extortion because it was a\nhelicopter obviously full well maybe we\njust just briefly want to mention that\nwas August 2011 as I recall yes yeah\nAugust of 11 yeah so but in 2010 Adam is\nkilled\nand I got a phone call and and I wasn't\nbest friend I mean Adam had some very\nclose friends as to command that I I\ndon't want to make some anybody give the\nimpression that like me and Adam were\nboys we were we knew each other well\nright we went through green to him\ntogether he was in a different Squadron\nthough so you sort of get separated a\nlittle\nand I got a phone call in the middle of\nthe night from one of my buddies who's\nstill in who is is another\nLegend and\num I answered the phone and it's\nmidnight I knew something was wrong and\nwe were kind of in this pattern then and\nyou're like actually a few of the\ncommands were like our partner command\nand a bunch of other guys we work with\nin other units it was a hard time like\nguys were fighting hard overseas and um\nthat just comes with the consequences we\nknow you know and I get the phone call\nthe middle of the night I'm\nlike and\nso this guy tells me you know get your\nuniform you need to come in something\nhappened and I'm like I know\nwhat happened like tell me who it is and\nand they you know didn't want to say it\nover the phone which I\nget and uh\nI I had like one of those moments where\nI told him no I I can't I can't do that\nagain like you have to get somebody who\nknows what the they're\ndoing and he just didn't let me off the\nhook you\nknow get your and come come into\nthe command because you got to do all\nthis prep stuff and um I walked into the\nconference room I mean I remember\nclear's day Andrew I walked into the\nconference room and I could see it on\neverybody's face again this is 2010\nnow they\nwere more terrified than I was and these\narei you know civilian guys guys who\nretired who are now civilians they work\nat the command and amazing people and\nthey looked like I don't know if you've\nseen um Peter Jackson's remake they\nshall not grow old oh you have to watch\nit they shall not grow old is Peter\nJackson took Real World War I footage oh\nI did see that yeah he put the color in\nthe lip reading and it and there's a\nscene I don't know if it's a Battle of\nthe Bulge or exactly there's a scene\nwhere\num this young unit army unit is about to\ngo up over over the top and you know run\nacross open field and the camera pans\nover and there's a young kid with his\nrifle in front of him the bayonet a\nfixed to it his helmet on his lips are\nsort of flat and pursed and he everybody\nin that conference room looked like him\nwhen I saw that movie later I'm like\nevery single person looked like him and\nthey told me it was Adam and we were\ngoing to go notify\nKelly his\nwife and he had little ones at that\npoint Savannah and Nathan yeah they were\nsmall and\num we knocked on she had a sort of a\nstained glass like window and I could\nsee her at the top of\nthe the\nstairs that was the worst man it was the\nworst so we sat with Kelly and a bunch\nof other guys were there of course it\nwasn't just me and we did our\nbest and I learned later and you know\nreading Paul's work Dr KY and other\npeople and like that was it dude I was\nlike a um I don't know if it's a locust\nor whatever that sheds their skin I\nliterally like left a shell of myself on\nKelly's front porch and walked out of my\nskin it was that was tough that was\ntough and so that was kind of the tempo\nto answer your question like it wasn't\nexactly every 90\ndays but almost every 90 days from ' 06\nto 2011 for me I got out in the fall of\n2011 it was Memorial at the theater\nMemorial at the people's house you know\nand our neighbor across the street in\nVirginia Beach she lost her husband in '\n07 so one house over so she was best\nfriends with us you know and so you are\ntrying to live two\nlives you have\nthis military life with all these\nconsequences\nwhere every bone in your body is telling\nyou\nto go full Spartan like no not that the\nSpartans didn't have families because\nthey did whatever did nothing else like\njust cut off every other thing in your\nlife completely you have to go do this\nand you have to do it full on because\nclearly all bets are off like we're\nbarely making it through we're losing\nour best guys and how the do I\nsurvive if at this pace and so because\nwe're all in the same community in\nVirginia Beach you're around it all the\ntime when you're home you know and you\nshould be because you're supporting your\nteammates families and that's important\nbut it was just it's almost like a dream\nyou know when I think about it now how\ndo how did we live like that how does\nanyone live like that and I know you\nknow my experience as the military\npeople go through you know all sorts of\ntough situations and different walks of\nlife but I have so much compassion for\nanybody who's trying to live in an\nenvironment like that\nwhere you know you are going on the next\ndeployment and you know I mean look\nAndrew we left bakan in 08 before Tommy\nwas killed three weeks later\nguys are getting blown up in the same\narea like and they they got all the\ndebrief from us they knew exactly where\nto go but it was just such a kinetic\nenvironment\n[Music]\num we it was almost like you couldn't\nstop it you know it was just like the\nballs rolling and when I think about\npeople overseas and you know different\nsituations that countries find\nthemselves in right\nnow um I can feel it for for them you\nknow what they're what it takes it's\na it's an intense\nenvironment yeah certainly uh that comes\nthrough uh\nI think years ago you said to me um and\nthis will be an important way of of um\nsetting aside uh which side people are\non you know whether or not you side with\none group in the Middle East or the\nother you feel for everybody that uh one\nof the things that you said that really\nrung in my ears for a long time is that\nthe warriors on both\nsides in their own minds each and all of\nthem are just doing what they think is\nright for them and their families\ntotally like you cannot erase that fact\nlike like whether or not the government\nof this country or the government of\nthat country or group was correct or\nincorrect whether or not you're even\ntalking about a terrorist cell versus a\nmilitary a formal military group or\nSpecial Operations group that in the\nminds of the\nWarriors they're doing what they truly\nbelieve is right for them and their\nfamilies and sometimes country as well\nand when I heard that it was sort of a\nyou know it's it's sort of an obvious\nstatement on the one hand but it's a\nvery important one I think to the\npsychology that you know everyone's\nfighting tooth and nail because they\nbelieve that they are right or they're\njust fighting tooth and nail for\nwhatever reason and that was an\nimportant thing for me to hear and I\nthink about that a lot when I see any\nnews stories about International\nconflict or terrorist military conflict\nterrorist civilian stuff even people\nthere's something about the human brain\npeople get this into their mind like\nthis is my job and they're doing it\ndoesn't justify it right\nbut going back to this thing of being a\nweapon yep humans can be trained as\nweapons and and it's often not the\nweapons themselves that are making the\ndecisions about where to go and what to\ndo sometimes it is um at this time\nColeman what's going on with the three\nboys with Bridget I mean you're um I\nmean your boys have turned out really\nwell um amazing they're amazing um and\nthere's no coincidence there and\nobviously it was a team effort with you\nand Bridget but you know there are a lot\nof things about the way the scenario\nyou're describing here that speaks to\nlike how can a home function but\nobviously it functioned well and um you\nknow it's uh it's remarkable but it\ncan't be due to chance so the were you\nable to compartmentalize like the moment\nyou hit your front door your dad at home\nyour husband your um and was that a\npause in a conversation with your\nyourself at the front door that's just\nsomething that becomes\nreflexive uh I mean\nI I think it was just reflexive it\nwasn't really a pause at the front door\nand admittedly the story I would like to\ntell is that I was super Zen about it\nand I had this process and I would come\nhome and I would take this off and put\non regular dad things and I think I was\njust about by the same level of effort\nthat we put into what we were\ndoing Bridget and every other wife\nmom at least the ones that I knew they\nput that level effort in as well it made\nour home\nlife just very comfortable so it was\neasy like I didn't have to go through\nsome process right it was it this is how\nI remember it was easy for me I don't\nknow if it was easy for Bri she would\nhave to answer that question it was easy\nfor me and so I felt like for the most\npart like I was I wasn't like platoon\nCommander dad you know some movie you\nknow the great Santini type dad you know\nI think Pat Conroy GRE WR the great\nSantini um his dad was crazy apparently\nit's like that's what he writes about it\nwasn't like that it was more of this\nthis home is such a\nrelief and Bridget is so dialed that I\ndon't have to\nunfortunately hard for Bridget I don't\nhave to do anything you know the time\nthat I'm here I can be here and then you\nknow go away again and and so it's as we\nknow what trauma does to the mind like\nthere are many many stretches of that\ntime\nperiod\nthat I just don't\nremember and and I and what I do\nremember is\nmostly obviously the fun times the front\nyard the whatever playing with the bo\nboys um doing rough housing and going on\nvacation and stuff but the when I was in\nthe grind when we were in the training\ncycle of our cycle or deployment or\nwhatever I don't really\nremember sections of\nit\nso a lot far too many I guess even one\nwould be far too many uh doorbells\nringing on\ndoorbells you decide to get out\nMH uh was that a conscious decision\nbased on time conscious decision based\non like I would like to have the rest of\nmy life you're done I like to call it a\nregret you know but it's just kind of\nemblematic of where I was it was the\nright decision I do not regret getting\nout at the 13e Mark not for a\nsecond it I needed it we needed it as a\nfamily\num it was a snap it was a snap decision\nit was like a what do we say 24-hour\ndecision and 24-hour Horizon I was\nstanding on the ledge of the 24-hour\nHorizon right um and you said what year\nwas that again that was the fall of 2011\n2011 yeah okay so that's about four or\nfive years four or five years before you\nand I met yeah so extortion we can just\nwe don't have to touch into it too\ndeeply because people can look it up but\nthis was a a massive loss of Special\nOperations included a lot of seals um it\nwas basically helicopter shot out of the\nsky with a uh with a rap with a grenade\nright yeah RPG RPG\num people can look it up if they want to\nand um there's a lot of material out\nthere about it um it's just can only be\ndescribed as a tragedy so um and I'm not\ntrying to make light of it I just think\nyou that we could do there's a lot to\nexplore there for in a different\ndiscussion um okay so you're\nout now the probability that you're\ngoing to die is much lower provided it's\nnot what my nervous system said right\nbut you're you're out\nmhm and what do you do\nmeaning what do you do with all that\nenergy the energy of the way you've been\noperating up until now these intense\nbattle rhythms vampire schedules as you\ncall them but also what do you do with\nall the energy of what happened you know\nI think this is where I think our\nconversation really hopefully has been\nrelated to other people as we've been\ngoing but that you know sometimes I stop\nand I'm like I know I'm supposed to\nprocess all this stuff you know that's\nhappened but it's like what do you do\nwhen so much is happened or When\nSomething's Happened that you know you\nhave to move on from you know you need\nto compartmentalize but that lives in\nour nervous system so are you thinking\nabout that no you're Coleman Ruiz at\nthat point you're just uh you're just\ngoing forward it's just crazy I\nmean I just didn't know you know it's\n2011 doesn't sound like that long ago\nbut still\nin 2011 this was not a topic for\nconversation you know\nand I took maybe one week to process out\nI turned in my gear I turned in my\nbadge and my next visit to the command\nyears later I had to be escorted on by\npeople I worked with in the same\nSquadron like so within a matter of one\nweek I'm a stranger like I can't get on\nthe base I there's reasons for that I\nget that but I'm just using it as a I\nmean there was nothing dishonorable\nabout how you went it's just that\nthere's security reason once you're out\nlike you can't just drive on the base\nanymore you know\nand this is like emblematic of of course\nI didn't talk to anybody about it not\neven Bridget but um at the time in those\nfirst call it couple of years or even\ncouple of months I don't\nknow the question you just ask me is the\nquestion I was at like what do I do like\nnot with work like what do I do period\nwith life like how do I manage my time\nand I'm not some bumbling idiot it's not\nlike I was walking around the\nneighborhood like trying to figure out\nwhere my house was\nI I had just been in that environment\nfor so long to your point that\num I didn't know what to do I didn't\nknow what to do with my thoughts my\nfeelings my you know I could go to the\nBuddhist five Aggregates my thoughts\nfeelings perceptions physical form and\nkind like all these things I've learned\nabout and thought about later that have\nhelped so much I didn't know what to do\nwith any of it like I didn't know what\nto do with night sweats I didn't know\nwhat to do with I thought the term PTSD\nwas the was the biggest joke on\nthe planet until I read all the symptoms\nand I'm\nlike wait wait a minute um sounds sounds\nlike sounds familiar and so it's that\nand was like and so I remember like even\nthe little things that kind of make the\npoint of the big things I didn't know\nhow to get a dentist like just go to the\ndentist in the military I you know I I\nthought when I was walking around the\nfood line that somebody was going to\ncall me and say come back to the base\nbecause like the bubble went up you just\nI had zero context and didn't have the\nCur or the not even not even just the\ncourage but know who to ask right it\nwasn't the mentoring one of the most\nimportant books in my life in the last\n12 years has been Joseph Campbell's the\nhero with a thousand faces for the back\nend of the hero's journey and I haven't\nread it I know I should I know I should\nyou should actually listen to it to\nlisten to it it's better to I've\nprobably only listened to five audio\nbooks in my life I prefer to read in\npaper because I can take notes in the\nmargin that book is better listen to\nhero with a thousand faces a hero with a\nthousand faces could you just highlight\na couple of the things that you took\nfrom the back end of that um that\nsomehow shifted your mind toward like\nlike cued you I'm thinking Coleman ruy\nuh Circa 2011 is like like what do I do\nnow and then something cues you there's\nlike a beacon someplace it's like I like\na texture of something like I want you\nknow you want to feel it more to get a\nsense of what it is that is that about\nright it was in that case for sure um so\nJoseph Campbell wrote that book in\n1949 and the her with a thousand faces\nis effectively the 17 stage Heroes\nJourney which by the way George Lucas\nsays and has said many times publicly he\nbuilt the Arc of Star Wars around the 17\nstage Heroes Journey he credits Joseph\nCampbell's book for helping him and if\nyou ever read it or you go through the\n17 stages or you see it or watch a short\nvideo anybody you'll see how damn near\neverybody's life which is why it's\ncalled the monomyth he describes it as\nthe monomyth or the cosmogonic cycle\nthere's a little weirder term for it\num but what he lays out in the book is I\ndon't know maybe supposedly 2,000 years\nof culture across multiple cultures book\nis incredibly complicated in that sense\nAndrew when I so I listen to it audio\nfirst and I went back to it and listened\nto it in paper I could not believe how a\nhuman could put this narrative together\nhonestly and so but the\nsummary I struggle with the first 10\nstages a little bit but it I'll try to\ncome back to them if you if you look at\nthe image when you lay out the 17 stages\nthe way it's in a circle is the Ordinary\nWorld and the extraordinary world is on\nthe bottom of the page and there's a\nhorizontal line the diameter of that\nCircle goes horizontally across and the\nextraordinary world on the bottom the\nordinary worlds on the top okay and so\nlet me talk about the back end of the\njourney first CU what I was mostly\nconcerned about with when a friend\npointed me to that book was my return to\nthe Ordinary World and he told me you\nColeman you got to read this book and so\nthe back end of the hero's journey in\nthe return\nsection is three seven stages of the 17\nit's the ultimate Boon which is you\nlearned something big in life it\ndepending on everybody learns something\nwhere you you sort of realize something\nbig happened to me that's the ultimate\nBoon and you have this incredible desire\nto do something with it it's either\nknowledge or it's experience or whatever\nand the ultimate Boon you have and you\nfeel like this life thing and then the\nnext stage is typically uh refusal of\nthe return you really don't want to come\nback to the Ordinary World cuz you feel\nthat there is some level of consequence\nthat maybe you can't handle or somebody\nwon't understand you know or maybe it's\ntoo mundane you'll be maybe you'll feel\nuh a drift totally yeah that and this is\nin the description of the stages what\nyou just described as part of that\ndescription the next stage you're coming\nup back into the Ordinary World and this\nreturn is Magic Flight and the way it's\ndescribed in you know um myths or in\nreal life is you have to escape that\nextraordinary world and a and take one\nmore dangerous flight or or sneak away\nor something is catapulting you to take\nthat ultimate Boon and fight against\nthat refusal you're you're taking Magic\nFlight amazing and then there is\num is\nit it's it's assistance I think yeah\nit's like assistance from a um like a\nspecial power or something which could\nbe your own or somebody\nelse right and then and then suddenly\nyou're into the last three which is\ncrossing the crossing the return\nthreshold into the Ordinary World master\nof Two Worlds where you finally realize\nthrough help Andor process where you can\nhold these two opposing life experiences\nin place and then the very last stage 17\nis freedom to live and when you can I'm\ngoing to give you my little pet theory\nin a second\nwhen you can work your way through those\nstages you can have the freedom to\nlive what I realized potentially happen\nto me just my internal feelings about\nyou know my coming in out of the\nmilitary and back is if you\nskip or you don't figure out how to deal\nwith the refusal to return and and you\njust pick I'm going to call it the next\nbig thing you catapult yourself into a\nnew cycle and you never finish and one\nof two things has happened you're either\ntwo people trapped in the Ordinary World\nor you're one person trapped in the in\nTwo Worlds I don't know which it is like\nit's either Two Worlds in one person or\nit's two people trying to live in one\nworld but gets crazy right because\nyou just haven't done the cycle and it\nsounds very misul but if you read a here\nwith a thousand faces you're like this\njourney is not new like this is\nthousands of years of very typical human\ncycle now if we go back to the top of\nthe\ncircle let me try to scream through the\nfirst 10 which will be very obvious for\nStar Wars fans just think about what\nLuke does and I'm not like a super star\nwars person I've seen the movies but\nit's a call to Adventure most of us have\nhave a call to Adventure of some sort in\nour life refuse to call help from a\nmentor crossing the first threshold the\nbelly of the whale which is described as\nwhen you first truly separate this was\nme leaving for college when you first\ntruly separate from\nthe Ordinary World Road of\nTrials meeting the\ngoddess Temptations atonement with the\nFather apostasis which is kind of like\ndying uh death while you're still alive\nand then you're into those return stages\nand when I first read that book Andrew I\nwas like I'm trapped in the return I'm\ntrapped somewhere in the\nreturn just emot\nAl and one of the\nplaces that I was absolutely trapped in\nthe return was I didn't have the mentor\nto help me cross the threshold I knew I\nhad to move on in my\nlife I knew I had learned something\nextremely\nvaluable I knew that there was a way\nthrough because people across thousands\nof years of humanity have done it I\ndon't think I'm\nspecial and I never had the mentor I I\ngot mentor later you know a couple years\nout um and it reminds\nme that in the so I got out in the fall\nof 2011 in the summer one of my very\ngood friends who lives in Connecticut he\nworks in New York he brought me to a\nlunch at some fancy Club in New York um\nwith a guy named Buddy bua Paul buddy\nbua who won the Congressional Medal of\nHonor he's a West Point grad he won the\nC in\nVietnam I've been around a lot of you\nknow famous military people lunch was\nvery normal but buddy was amazing it it\nwas a normal lunch we didn't talk about\nmuch like impact we didn't talk about\nCombat Action or\nwhatever there was a green velvet set of\nstairs we were leaving the club the\nupstairs we were coming down the green\nset of stairs if I remember Buddy's a\nlittle bit shorter than I am he reached\nout his left I was on his left he\nreached out his left arm I was a stair\none stair below him he stopped me I\nturned to my right to look at him he\nlooked at me he said Son you have have\nit you know that you have it pts and\nyou're going to have to deal with it and\nwe left I got in a cab and I left and I\nremember\nthinking you might have it but I\ndon't because that's the old days like\nwe're we were prepared for this I\nwas still\nconvinced that I'm good like nothing\nhappened to me nothing in the military\nhappened to me that's just normal stuff\nand all of our training it's a story I\ntold myself all of our training prepared\nme for that like this the rest of my\nlife is just going to it nothing bad is\ngoing to happen because I'm good\nwhatever that meant and when I started\nto learn more and read more and talk to\npeople who are helping me I remembered\nbuddy telling me that\nand back to those return stages Andrew\nit's just incredibly important for me to\nunderstand that my journey is not\nspecial we are part of a long history of\nevolution that people go through very\nchall and I mean the 17 stages in Jose\ncould not be more accurate to like to my\nlife particularly the\nreturn and of course if one looked from\nthe outside they would agree with your\nmindset then and say you're alive MH you\ncertainly done very hard things\nextraordinary things you're married you\ngot three kids they're\nthriving PTSD postraumatic stress\ndisorder order uh and things like it CU\nI don't think any single acronym or\ndiagnosis can capture anything I think\nPaul kti made that very clear to us in\nthe mental health series these are names\nby necessity but it's a framework that\ncertainly taught me something absolutely\nand and and certainly those who haven't\nbeen in the military maybe had a seed\nevent of something challenging or\nwhatever it is you know um many people\nuh struggle with with these kinds of\nthings that live inside them um in the\nnervous system they pack it down maybe\nthey don't but um that was inside you at\nthat point M I think you and I first got\nacquainted in somewhere around\n2016 when you and some other folks from\ntier one community and related\ncommunities started coming to lab and my\nlab and I never really talked publicly\nabout my lab has been involved with\nvarious things in Canada and the US um\nnot trying to create any Mystique there\nbut it's it's not not a point of\nInterest what we did and and um but I\nrecall at that time just thinking like\nthis guy's just an amazing team guy but\nin any event\num you know we got to know each other a\nbit and my since then was like it's like\na that's kind of indestructible right\nyou know and now I realize nobody's\nindestructible we're flesh and Bone but\num but if we may let let's let's fast\nforward a bit um to uh a couple years\nlater um if you're willing to talk about\nit um maybe talk about some of the uh\nthe evolution that happened so you\nstarted working a job MH um you're\ngetting back into civilian life yep and\num I recall a conversation about this\ntime of year probably about three year\nthree years\nago yeah and you had done what um a lot\nof uh vets from um tier one operations\nhave done and are now doing which I\nactually have um mostly uh favorable\noutlook on which is um there now these\nare uh I want to be very clear legal and\nsanctioned explorations of the\nPsychedelic space right and I remember\nyou called me and you described uh the\nexperience that you had uh had um and\nsome of the connection with Warrior\nculture that that had helped emerge for\nyou so you could you explain what\nhappened there you know probably the\nentry Andrew is as important you know\nmeaning it's not all about books but\nthis is actually another thing I've\nreally learned you know I was very\nintellect and achievement\nCentral and as you can see how easy the\nemotion comes out now I kind of very\nfrighteningly understand people who like\nfeel stuff a lot more it's a whole other\nlandscape it's miserable well wait yeah\nit is yet it's I I agree I it's a very\nuncomfortable space uh you know but\nwe'll get we'll get there it's it's a\njourney for me let me put it that way so\nyou know there's a bunch of other I'm a\nvicious reader and I really enjoy it and\nyou know my entree and little window\ninto the world of getting that kind of\nhelp came from a lot of different areas\num I\nfound in our area a cranos cyal\ntherapist who\nit still seems like because I mentioned\nit to people and it sounds Fringe to\nthem it's a very light touch not even\nChiropractic like and it's closer to\nmyof fasal type of massage some some\ntapping very like Ta on the top of the\nhead the part I actually love the most\nis the back of the neck sort of\nmanipulation is you're lying down\nrelaxed yeah you're clothed super easy\nin terms of that um couple years of that\njust because of Athletics I love massage\nand that's kind of my entree and um so\nthrough the body sematics yeah which\nfrankly in many ways is my favorite back\nto the physical orientation to the world\nis is what I is what's useful to me\num but also I I mean I read Sam Harris's\nfirst book end of faith in 2006 and so\nI've followed him for 15 years\nreligiously read all of his books um\nlying moral\nlandscape and his I I don't know him\npersonally so public stuff\nnotwithstanding that's not important to\nme but waking up and I took um I took an\nonline course with Robert Wright who who\nwrote why Buddhism is true but that's\nreally not what he's known for you know\nPrinceton Professor um he's so funny\nhe's very humorous and I started to work\nmy\nway into I don't I don't have some like\nI don't want people think have some like\nwhizbang like spiritual practice that's\nwhatever you know I but it it became\nvery interesting to me Andrew this this\nI I needed to find I started to realize\nI needed to find a way to back away from\nthe 24-hour ledge like that Super Hyper\nFocus I needed to get a little bit of\nperspective one of my favorite short\nvideos is Richard Fan's pale blue dot I\nneeded to just back away you know that\nreminds me thank you so much for talking\nabout time space bridging I think the\nother day yeah we make we I'll cue\npeople to that clip in the caption it's\na way of taking oneself out of one's\nimmediate sphere of vision and looking\nliterally looking further out into one's\nenvironment and then back again as a\nperceptual exercise of understanding\nthat as our visual field expands our\nperception of time also expands um the\nbinning the chunking of time yeah that\nand my and your conversation years ago\nabout um Horizon and activating the\nparasympathetic system instead of\nsympathetic I I just very slowly started\nto realize I needed to back away from\nthe small\npicture and the reading and the cranial\nsacr and massage and I was still not\nreally getting consistent real help but\nI thought I could do it through\neducating myself\nintellectually and um I thought it was\ntime to and it was it has short-term\nconsequences but longterm it's been\namazing\n[Music]\nto you know deal with the plant\nmedicines in a in a controlled and Cur\nated environment and that experience\nwas super safe and quite amazing\nactually the weekend or the three or\nfour\ndays was super intense but I didn't\nleave there\nthinking again I kind of thought I'm\ngood that was\ngreat yeah uh couple things um one we've\ncovered psychedelics on this podcast\nbefore um I say this not for liability\nreasons but just to really to emphasize\nuh for people safety uh to protect them\num plant medicines are illegal most\nplaces still um this is changing MDMA is\nuh has been filed with the FDA as a\npotential treatment it's not yet legal\num these things have great power of of\nhe to heal in the right circumstances\nand they also have great uh potential to\nharm in the wrong hands or circumstances\num people with uh you know potential for\npsychosis Etc but\num with that said um I remember I was on\nI was driving I was on a phone call with\nyou around this time of year about three\nyears ago maybe it was four but I think\nit was three years ago and I said what\nwas your experience with um iigame DMT\nlike um and you said you know it was\namong the most profound experiences of\nmy entire life and I recall you saying\nthat you felt that it had connected you\nthrough time to all the warrior cultures\nthat had preceded you not just US\nmilitary but all Warrior cultures and\nyou sounded great you sounded\nlike better than great you weren't high\nbut you just sounded like man like like\nsomething had had had synced up yeah and\nI thought this is great you know and I\nhadn't explored plant medicines at least\nnot in a long time because I had done\nthem recreationally as a youth which I\ndo not recommend it took me down a bad\npath um but and more recently I've\nexplored them in controlled conditions\nbut I thought awesome this work you got\nthis new job you're you're uh you did\nsome um very controlled and again\nphysician assisted abigan DMT uh\nexperiences and you're telling me how\ngreat everything was Y and then about I\nthink it was about 3 4 months later I\ngot a very different call yeah and and\num if you're willing you know I remember\nthat call um maybe you can tell me about\nthat call yeah so I mean this yeah the\nexperience it it was incredibly powerful\nyou know humor is such a powerful way to\nget through hard times just why laughing\nyeah but it it really was Andrew I mean\nto be fair\nto thousands of years of you know people\nhave experience with these\nthings we often joked about like what\npoor sucker reached down and grabbed\nthat root for the first time and chewed\non it iboga tree boy he found\nout or she or she yeah to be fair to be\nfair probably you know some session that\nwasn't supposed to go that direction and\nsomeone chewed on the wrong route but um\nit was extremely powerful um I've heard\nthat you know the 5 Meo for some people\nis not much it's like\nblack for me it was just\nliftoff and\num I saw an entirely perfect geometric\nMosaic in light blue and\nwhite\nand that was the warrior Culture\nConnection like that whole 20 minute\nride was just something else um as you\nknow I guess I haven't done it noetic is\nthe word no yeah that people use very\ndifficult I don't have the language for\nit and a couple months later the bottom\ndropped\nout yeah and it and I want to talk about\nthat now I I also want to emphasize I\nknow a good number of people that have\nuh had the same experience you did with\naiga and DMT through the veteran\nsolutions group um uh and I know Marcus\nand Amber Capone very well actually a\nbill just got passed in Congress that uh\nDan krenshaw helped um helped um\nspearhead to bring funding to use of\npsychedelics for PTSD treatment in in\nmilitary um and I should mention because\nthis was interesting to learn that that\nbill was highly bipartisan if I'm not\ngoing to name off the names because if I\ndo there's going to be a lot of cringing\nscreaming and yelling but if it's like\nif ever there was a bill that was\nsupported from both sides of the aisle\nwith the like the most diametrically\nopposed names who came together around\nthat funding it's that bill yeah and um\njust striking it's a and um so is a very\nbipartisan thing so I will say a number\nof people uh have been greatly benefited\nby the veteran Solutions work um but and\nwe can't causally link what happened to\nyou afterwards to that at all there's a\nlot of contextual stuff um so we're not\ndoing that but we're we're an open book\nhere um and I think that's a great group\nby the way veteran Solutions is amazing\num a few months later you said the\nbottom dropped out so what happened and\nwhen did you start to notice it and then\nmaybe we can talk about that phone call\nyeah I think um you know looking back\nAndrew I think a couple things most\npeople who call me about you know\nfriends who say hey should I go do this\nI initially tell them well 100% of the\ntime I tell them no\nuntil until you\nget I was having this conversation last\nweek with a guy who I never met\nbefore you need to stabilize\nyour situation whatever your situation\nis through some very slow deliberate Dr\nkti level help because in the case of\nI'm happy to see that some people\nthey're using just a wider spectrum of\non-ramp not the nuclear option to start\nI can tell you unequivocally abigan and\n5 Meo DMT 2 days apart is the nuclear\noption and it's not right for everybody\njust I'm not a scientist there's no\nquestion that cannot be right for\neverybody that just doesn't make any\nsense there's other ways to enter I\nbelieve and when you say the cont option\nwell just for those that didn't see the\nseries with Dr Paul K we'll put a link\nto in the show note captions but uh what\nColeman's referring to is talk therapy\nwith somebody highly skilled yes and\nperhaps also prescription uh medication\nif that's necessary maybe hormone\ntherapy if that's necessary that's up to\nthe physician but but clearly talk\ntherapy of with a skilled clinician I\nbelieve I need needed I don't know what\nother people need I needed a mentor to\nhelp\nme contextualize what I was coming from\nand what I'm going to\nand my experience you know with the plan\nmedicines was it um kicked the door wide\nopen and took that\nbeautiful ice sculpture perhaps at a\nperson's wedding and shattered it on the\nfloor and I was again left alone my\nfault anybody else's left alone to\nfigure out how to put that ice sculpture\nback together piece by piece and you my\nbelief is I could have avoided that by\nhaving a much more deliberate process so\nwhen suddenly the ice sculpture was on\nthe ground and every bit of intellect\nthat I built over you know however long\nfour\ndecades I was I was flat on my back and\nand as as I told you Andrew and I've\nbeen you know really verbal about with\nso many friends who only want to talk\nabout it in quiet circles which I\ntotally understand and and respect and\nif you want to talk about in a quiet\ncircle like email the humor like P\npodcast and you can give them my cell\nphone number because I know how\nimportant it is to people when they're\nin that stage is\num that was another thing that I never\nthought was possible for\nhumans it was severe depression severe\nand and I was\nso because I guess I just never thought\nabout it again or never had a mentor the\nshocking thing Andrew was how shocked I\nwas it's like if I had known something\nlike this was real not that I would have\nlistened to anybody if they said it but\nthe most shocking thing was that again\nthis could happen to me and when it did\nhappen I was\ncompletely\nunequipped to deal with I could it took\nforget how weak forget every other thing\nin my life it\ntook\n10,000x the energy of anything I've ever\ndone in my life before to just put my\nfeet on the ground in the morning I\ncould not PT I couldn't run and you're\nlike I could not\n function I did function somehow\nto some level but it was so\nterrifying I I just have for any one\nlistening who has been through I just\nhave such incredible respect for people\nwho have dealt with it and have learned\nto get through something like that\ndepression oh yeah or any pick the pick\nthe title right whatever tough situation\nsomeone's in emotionally I have such\ntremendous respect for them because I\nwould have\nbeen years ago the guy who like just\ntighten up your boots and get to\nit it's not possible like you have to\nget help from people who care about you\nand you have to like you have to step\nback away from the problem set\nsomehow and and work through it you know\nstep by step the one of the most helpful\nthings and I'm so feel so fortunate that\nI never really had like the chemical\ndependence thing it was easy for me to\nstop drinking when did you decide to\nstop drinking that was it was around\nthree years ago or so is prior to prior\nto this lapse into depression no no\nright during yeah right there you just\nfigured alcohol is a bad thing right now\nyeah and I mean you and I have been\nfriends for a while now do some of the\nthings you and I have discussed and I\nhear you talk about publicly they were\njust good reminders you know um one of\nthe things I absolutely hate but I do\nevery day which is wait 90 minutes to\ndrink coffee oh it's the worst I cannot\ntell you how much of a difference that's\nmade in my energy throughout the day and\nthe drinking was similar you know I I\nlike look I'm just going to drop it for\na couple weeks and then suddenly my\nsleep's better my fitness is better you\nknow so you know we all even my friend\nyou know you chat about stuff oh what\nare you doing at this age you I'm\napproaching 50 that helps you stop\ndrinking everything else like all the\nother recommendations come second at\nleast for me um was that pretty easy for\nyou to do because I know there's B big\nculture of drinking in the teams yeah I\nwas just lucky\nso\num so my point there is you know the\njust the respect I have for people who\nwho work through stuff like that and I\nwas going to say the reason I referenced\nto drinking is because I started reading\na lot about the 12 Steps AA I've never\nbeen to AA meeting but the the Simpson\nthe PTSD in the 12 Steps like oh my God\nthis is me like I need to go through\nthese steps in my own way not for you\nknow not for\ndrinking but for whatever this low grade\nthe way I've described it is you know\nthe Buddhist obviously call Dua it's\nunsatisfactoriness this lowgrade\nirritation that I carry around every\nday um the one amazing thing that that\ncouple of months did for me and the way\nI describe it visually is if someone cut\nme from neck to belly and filleted open\nmy chest and took a propane torch and\nscorched me from the inside and then put\nme back together and said start\nover that's how it felt that's literally\nhow it felt I mean I could not believe\nAndre and you can obviously you know Dr\nkti can articulate this better I\ncouldn't believe how emotional pain\ncould be so physically\npainful that whole experience again the\nshocking part was the shocking part I\njust I I just didn't think it was real\nand so then when it was and I'm like how\nmany things do I have to deal\nwith you know and I realize everybody\ndeals with a lot of stuff and um it was\nchallenging and then slowly you know it\ngot better and better and\num guys like you know friends very close\nfriends a very very small tight group\nwere and what\npeople do when you finally tell\nthem and you think oh this guy's\ngonna he's never going to talk to me\nagain they do the\nopposite they rally immediately for you\nyou know and then guys that aren't in\nyour inner circle necessarily helping\ndirectly in they're in the neck\nCircle cuz now it's very weird it's back\nto like the feeling thing I can not 100%\nof the time but a lot of guys in my\ncommunity if I speak to them and they're\nin a bad spot I can detect it within 5\nSeconds just the tonal and kind of like\nthe\ntempo and when you tell that ring of\npeople not your super Inner\nCircle they dump it immediately as soon\nas you open the door they're like hey\nman I had a couple of tough like months\nyou know boom they're right in for the\nmost part they open up Y and that really\nscares me Andrew because I\nknow like if we need if we need to flip\nthe switch this afternoon like we can\nflip the switch meaning meaning like I\ncan go to Old School\n20 you know 15 years ago that that's\nthat's what you and I have discussed in\nthe past has kind of come back to you\nknow the fighter mentality is the the\nproblem with that the hardcore intense\nfocused that's easy like it's so easy to\ndo that tough stuff that's easy this is\nthe hard part and that's\nwhat you know was so challenging it was\nto go to people who normally we do you\nknow the yeah yeah let's do this let's\ndo that let's do something crazy and\nokay well tell that same person who\nyou've\nbuilt Persona identity you know around\nthem and with them to like you're this\nguy and then you have a tough spot now\nyou have to go tell them the opposite\nlike I'm really not doing well it's\nterrifying it is terrifying and I uh but\nI I second W with with both arms um your\nstatement that when we actually open up\nto somebody\ntrusted uh hopefully a friend or\nsomebody close to us but like some\npeople go to clergy or AA or any any\nnumber of the different uh resources and\nthose resources really are out there at\nzero cost they really are there if one\none has to look a little bit sometimes a\nlot unfortunately but they're there um\nmy experience has always been and and in\nobserv others that um there's something\nabout the human spirit that wants to\nhelp totally and sometimes that help\ncomes from somebody who's really been\nthrough it but even if somebody hasn't\nbeen through it there's something in our\nnervous system that sees real pain in\nsomebody and contrary to what we think\nthey don't judge and think that\neverything that the person who's hurting\nwas before was a fraud the contrary they\nthey see it as a as an act of strength\nmhm and but it feels like like hell to\nreveal that it feel if and I totally\nagree I think all the tough stuff all\nthe um anything physical is is like a\nfraction of the emotional pain and I\nthank you for highlighting the the\nphysical aspect of of emotional pain\nespecially if one isn't accustomed to it\nif one isn't accustomed to it\n[Music]\num if you're willing you\nknow how bad did it get I mean the call\nyou\nwe had suggested it was bad I I\nsometimes refer to a line and I I'd be\nlying if I didn't admit that I've seen\nthat line a few times in my life I've\nbeen right up next to it a few times and\nnow if I ever see it I know to do many\nthings when it first comes into my my uh\nmy visual sphere um the line of course\nbeing that the point at which one is\nconsidering taking their own life y\nsomething that happens far too often\neven once is far too often and we've\nsort of skirted around this\ntopic after all the wartime stuff and\nthe gunfights and people dying in the\ndoorbells been a lot of friends of yours\nand some of whom I know but most of whom\nI don't but two this year uh who\ncontinue to kill themselves to put it\nbluntly where were you at with respect\nto that\nline because depression is one thing\nthere's mild depression there's severe\ndepression there's recurring depression\nthere's Manic and on and on and on but\nultimately that's a thing that\nuh hopefully everyone's seeking to avoid\num and it's a yeah how close were you I\nwould say that was probably I really\nwant to say one day and the truth is it\nwas one day it lasted one day being that\nclose to the line but it only takes a\nmoment to go that's the scary thing\nright it's and it probably lasted a\ncouple of weeks but there was only back\nto the budge thing like I never thought\nabout quitting I thought about it one\nday um what was the thought I don't it\nwas I mean sort of like the classic\nsympoms andreww I I was up all night\nsweating and shaking and um it's back to\nthe shock of it it was okay I actually\nwas able to step like one of two things\nis\nhappening either I am fundamentally bad\nthere's no way you can feel this bad and\nbe good\nso one of two things is happening like\nI'm just bad a bad person which I know\nis not true or something bad got inside\nof me that I have to get rid of and I\ndon't know how to get rid of it and so\nsweating shaking you know up at 3: in\nthe morning and legitimately\nthinking this is just the scariest thing\nand for anybody in the\nsituation\num you think with every ounce of your\nbeing that people are better off without\nyou and then\nsomehow thankfully Through Chemistry\nneurobiology past\nlearnings\num I stepped back away from that very\nquickly but the feeling of putting me up\nto that line didn't go away I just\nintellectually was able\nto is kind of where the maladaptive\nbehaviors you know back to training work\nin your favor which is I'm not\nquitting like this can't be just me even\nthough it did feel like just you I mean\nyou suddenly become the core of the\nentire existence of the universe you\nthink like you're it you know but in the\nnegative side of it not the Adaptive\nside of it um because the pain is just\nso extreme and um but I was able to back\naway from it and then\nover I'm so grateful to so many of my\nfriends I can't imagine how many hours\nif we collect up those hours how much\ntime I spent with them on the\nphone um and one of my in the like in\nthose really hard weeks maybe a little\nbit after that inre one of my buddies I\nwas actually was talking to him\nyesterday because I had time in the car\num the tough love side of it at when\nyou're feeling that poorly is a little\ntricky like I wouldn't I probably\nwouldn't deliver tough love unless I\nreally thought the person could handle\nit I think it's you got to really deal\nwith with kid gloves at that Mo those\nmoments um but one of my buddies told me\nif you do something to hurt yourself you\nwill have proven to every person who\nknows you that you are a liar\nand a fraud everything you've been about\nyour whole life is a\nfraud and Andrew I was we were on the\nphone I was\nlike whoa my God he just went 10 ring I\nmean dead\ncenter and it that was a pivot like that\nreally helped me a lot that's what you\nneeded I mean I I don't I don't know\nthat that's what I would have needed um\nI recall when we spoke uh because I\nobviously not professionally trained in\nany of that I just remember thinking how\ndo I put in this this into language that\nColeman's going to understand and I just\nsaid you know I think uh your goggles\nare I know one thing for sure which is\nthat your goggles are foggy so you got\nto so you have to\nOutsource your decisions now I think you\nmight have also told me to Outsource my\nidentity mhm and and that helped a lot\nbecause um it was that idea of you at\nFoggy goggles you're clearly like not on\nstable ground everything you believe\nabout yourself just let it be the spokes\nof a wheel that somebody else can hold\nfor you for a period of time I was like\nwell I can do that and then my other\nbuddy I didn't want to be a liar and a\nfraud I was like I can do that and yeah\nI\nI mean I'm grateful for the opportunity\nbut you know unfortunately had a few\ncircumstances where people close to me\nwere at at that edge and and i' I'd be\nlying if I say I've been at that edge so\nI knew where I had some sense of where\nyou were at um and under those\nconditions I don't think there's a\nPlaybook I mean obviously when people\nare have a plan and they're thinking\nabout implementing that plan that those\npeople need to be put under protection\nfrom themselves um Ely didn't come to\nthat yeah and you know a few friends\njust did the basics Andrew which\nwas I really wanted to talk to you at\nthat time because I knew you would give\nme some advice you know I was so\nuncertain about just the I'll just say\nthe chemistry but the chemistry and neur\nlike something is not right yeah uh and\nyou know different friends offered\ndifferent and some friends just sat and\nlistened to it allh and when I think\nback it's\nlike I would take a bullet for them cuz\nI just took it you know you know and let\nme offload it it's it's an amazing\nexperience for let people help you which\nI was never willing to do no and you\nwere we have to highlight something that\nmight have been overlooked earlier\nbecause we went through it quickly but\nthat you were you know you're a\ncommander of a unit so you're head of a\nfamily I know Bridget's also head of\nfamily there's a there's a trade you go\nback and forth right exactly um but\nyou're used to you're used to Leading\nand and protecting others and um like I\nthink it's awesome that you're um able\nto have access that that uh raising your\nhand asking for help you have to it's\nit's it's such a it it's such a a a sign\nof strength and skill and doesn't and it\nfeels like the exact opposite in the\nmoment the exact opposite and then we go\nto these narratives like oh if I've ever\ndone that in the past people didn't help\nthat you know we come up with a million\nexcuses but in the end it's it's it it's\nsuch a PO a thing of strength to do that\num so you did ratchet yourself out of\nthat very very dark hole slowly and um I\nI I want to place this in the context of\nthis uh hero's journey would you see\nthat you talk about that the Magic\nFlight the you're against you're like\nthe refusal you won't go back but so was\naccepting it seems that there was that\nsome pieces of you needed work yeah that\nthere was this PTSD this gentleman that\nyou mentioned yep saw that and you\nrefused to kind of deal with it and so\nshine a light on it and um God the\nuniverse whatever your beliefs are um\nforced you to see it\nY and you went to the very bottom but\nnot out the bottom\nyep what was the process of putting\nthings back\ntogether I mean really I mean a lot of\nit Andrew was cutting I so as a\npractical matter I mean I'm going to go\njust go back to regular therapy because\nI don't\nthat I mean my therapist is amazing she\nso you're you at what point did you\nenter quot talk therapy immediately then\nso you got a quote unquote therapist\nbecause oh yeah yeah I mean\neffectively you\nknow Bridget n and multi at some point\nit was it was Bridget was like this is\nthis is it like full-time help\neffective\nimmediately and I knew it was necessary\nbut if if I'm really honest like I would\nhave avoided it I would have somehow\nlike tried to gut through the situation\nwithout like full-time help and I mean\nonce a week therapy yeah so the idea of\nsitting down with somebody and talking\nabout past present and maybe some ideas\nof future was was worse to you than\njumping out of plane at 3,000 ft or\ngoing into a gunfight not even close not\neven close\nand hearing yourself say that D you\nrealize how how ridiculous well how how\num untrue that must be at the physical\nlevel but but the the nervous system\ndoesn't know as to quote uh Dr pa kti um\nthe lyic system that it experiences or\nor creates this sense of fear and dread\ndoesn't know the clock or the calendar\nif it's like if you go the meaning if\nyou experience that there's the idea\nthat it's going to go on forever I think\nthat's the fear that's correct yep\nthat's exactly right thank you for\nsaying that it the fear\nwas this will go on forever um but so\nyes it that I\njust did not want to you know back to\nBessel Vander when I read this word in\nhis book body keeps the score Lexia if\nthat's a real thing where you can't put\num language to you know what's going on\num I didn't want to put language to it I\ncouldn't I I just didn't feel like it\nlike I just felt like gutting through it\nand then I got you know once a week\ntherapy amazing\npeople and I don't know Andrew the first\nthree months\nwas you know I mean gutting through I\njust couldn't I couldn't seem to shed\nthat emotional like burden of pick the\ncategory of stuff from the last to say\n20 years it was just and but it was all\nI couldn't stop it from coming out and\nobviously that's a good thing and so\nthat just continued and every day got\nand when I say in this is the tough part\nfor at least me and I know a lot of guys\nlike me the gains are minuscule you know\nbut things improved slowly but surely\nwere there ever moments where you felt\nyou were drifting backward not really\nand that's that was nice you know you\nsee that there's some install you know\nplateaus um you don't have to share this\nbut would because I'm a believer that\ntalk therapy can be very effective\ncertainly that's my experience it's I\nwouldn't be here if it weren't for for\ntwo in particular amazing um people who\nreally help me along the way but um in\nthat way but I do think there's a place\nat times for pharmacology to assist the\nprocess sure um I know nowadays people\nhear ssris and they demonize those that\nthat wasn't uh I'll come clean so um and\nthen maybe if you feel like it you can\nuh I hit a a bout of depression in my\nduring my postdoc did a a short run of\nwell buin BR buproprion which is more of\nthe dopaminergic noradrenergic Y agonism\nmostly adrenaline\nnergic um it really helped it nuked my\nmemory at the dosage they\nsuggested um which meant I had to take a\nvery low dose and then eventually I came\noff and I think that that's one thing I\nlearned from Ki which is that most of\nthese medications were designed to help\npeople get over a bump as opposed to be\ntaken continuously some people need to\ntake them conv I I have been able to be\naway from that for a long time but but I\nthink Pharmacology can help oh yeah I\nthink I'd have to go back and look four\nmonths maybe of pretty low dose of\nWellbutrin thanks to okay that sounds\nyeah that's about right yeah thanks to\nmy buddy Jimmy you know I called him and\nasked him what he thought and he said\nwell you use a gun site on your weapon\ndon't you and you use glasses if you\ncan't see no I need reading glasses you\nneed glasses if you can't see right it's\nlike take the warb man chill\nlike just get it get some space back to\nthe SpaceTime bridging concept just get\nback away from the danger for a few\nmonths that really helped and that's\nvery different than the backing away\nfrom the danger with say alcohol or or\ndrugs and and look I my stance on\ncannabis is some people can use it\nsafely most people probably cannot but\nsome can but there's something different\nabout the drugs that have a addiction\npotential or the drugs that disrupt\nsleep like ultimately if you look at\npeople who commit suicide and I've spent\na lot of time with this literature in\nalmost every case in the preceding weeks\nthere's a disruption in sleep schedules\nmeaning disrupted from what they were\ndoing prior to that when they were not\nfeeling suicidal so so then you think\nabout alcohol disruption of sleep even\nif you think you're sleep sleeping and\nlike it's there's a story like a common\ntheme starts to emerge um so you\nstabilize sleep you were getting some um\ndopamine and neurogenic assistance from\nthe low dose rutrine and you're\nbasically also just you're just letting\nit all out yep with a therapist with a\ntherapist and the thing that strikes me\nas to your point about my resistance to\nthe therapy versus jumping out airplanes\nor\nwhatever the most important people in my\nwhole life since day one have been\npeople that have helped me coaches\nparents friends boom Doug War colleagues\nthe guys that I work for now like other\nyou you have all these people helping\nyou and then you hit this thing that's\nso unusual I'm like I don't want anybody\nto help me and I don't want to tell\nanybody about it it's like what is that\nAndrew that was the it's like what is\nthat and and it's not like I wasn't in\nthese environments where I've been\ncoached and mentored I I've had coaches\nand mentors on my ass my whole\nlife like instructors you know it's a\nNon-Stop and I I don't know like I\ncouldn't I just couldn't do it until I\ndid it and\nthen and you know it's been a process\nsince and I'm super grateful for it and\nI don't know where we are in the journey\nbut in terms of like the hero's journey\nbut I hope I'm at Freedom to live some\nversion of it\nbecause with my re this is dangerous cuz\nI only say this like with my really\nreally really close friends I know was\ngoing to more people in my CL I feel\nlike a completely different\nperson and none of that stuff really\never goes away it's all a process right\nand I'm never going to stop the\nprocess but I don't even recognize\nmyself in some ways anymore and that's\nbeen a good thing because in those times\nwhen I was just on the 24-hour Horizon\nsometimes I just did not know what the\n was going on other than exactly\nwhat I was doing you know and it's just\nan odd\nexperience to be in a different\nplace and it's scary to\nknow that without that experience and\nwithout people really kind of forcing me\nto get help and things forcing me I\nmight be doing the same stuff which is a\nhard way to live you know or worse or\nworse you might not be here or Worse\nwhich has happened to many of our\nbuddies you know and I want to go like\nretroactively hug them and collect them\nup in like a net and say guys just stop\nfor a second you know like\nwe it doesn't it doesn't have to go\nthere\num yeah I feel that the yearning in that\nstatement\nuh I I suffer from a terrible um very\ndestructive debilitating um desire to\ntravel back into time and fix things\nit's like it's like I know I don't have\nmy my graduate advisor who un\nunfortunately all three of my graduate\nadvisor are dead but she used to say um\nmy time machine's broken yeah anytime\nI'd raise something if you know that the\ncould have would have should have my\ntime machine's broken and and we know\nthat but I listen I felt that statement\nin every cell of my body it's clear you\nwould but you're also in sharing this\nthis experience and this information\nyou're you're you're doing that\nnow in what we call biology in the\ninterrog grade fashion and you know\nsomebody many people are going to hear\nthis and and cue to the the recognition\nof what's happening to them hopefully\nbefore they get to that line yeah you\nhave to\nand you just got to tell somebody you\nknow it's like it's crazy how simple\nthat is Andrew I mean months like I\ncan't tell anybody I can't tell anybody\nwell well and maybe we drill into this a\nlittle bit deeper because I think that\nthis really speaks to the the the global\nexperience of of Being Human where\nunlike a physical wound where you know\nif you see bone exposed you're like this\nis pretty serious you know we all have\ndifferent thresholds for what we can\ntolerate in terms of pain and and seeing\nourselves wounded we all don't have to\ndecide what's the difference between\nhurting and injured but when it comes to\npsychological stuff we don't know you\nknow we also are dealing with a a world\nnow where some people feel\npsychologically injured by everything\nyou know so that's the extreme there but\nwhat we're I\nthink I think\num what comes through and I think people\nneed to perhaps highlight in their minds\nis when something's kind of nagging or\nscratching at you Beneath The Sur that\nvoice what do you think that voice is I\ncall it the lowgrade pain okay for me it\nit was there was a\nlowgrade just slight hot\nburning starting in ' 07 probably before\nthat\nbut\nit was for me it was a weird mix and of\nlike an uncertainty a seeking\na this just doesn't feel right like it\nhas to be fixed there has to be an\nintellectual and achievement way to sort\nof get around this is where the Buddhist\nwriting and thinking really helped me a\nlot there has to be a way around this\nlowgrade unsatisfactory\nsomehow my sense for me and I'm\nobviously not you know the Dr kti in the\nroom just because of all the things I've\nlearned how it it it it just had to\nbe the this constant I'll use the word\ntrauma but for me it was it was like\nsomething had to happen to our system\nobviously it does something happens to\nour system that is a little bit of a\nthere's a shock there boom and then a\nbuddy gets killed and then you it's not\neven always with that then you have\nextreme firefight or you know close call\nand then it's just boom boom shock shock\nshock shock it's almost like getting TBI\nfor the nervous system it's just a\nconstant High it to me it always felt\nlike that constant\nhighend now if you keep going perhaps if\nyou never recognize any of it and you\njust keep jacking the dopamine and the\nadrenaline your whole life maybe you can\njust never recognize it but for me when\nI shut the engine off and I decided\nit's not really how I wanted to live and\nI was trying to work out of that\nlowgrade whatever I was residue that I\nwas left\nwith it was like every time I came from\nhome home from deployment I would get\nsick that night like I would have a\nfever that night headache and fever and\num I tend to get sick at the end of the\nyear last two years it was Christmas\nthis year it was Thanksgiving and um you\nknow bridg and I always joke about it\nit's because I slightly turn the engine\ndown a little and then the you know the\nimmune system yeah that's the way it\nworks everyone thinks stress depletes\nthe immune system and indeed it can yeah\nbut if you think about it in\nevolutionary\nadaptive you know ways go go go go go\nallows you to saave off the infection or\nat least to not have the symptoms of\ncombating infection and then when you\nrelax a little bit go on vacation boom\nyou get sick which is not to say\nconstantly stress but um you need to\nmodulate right you got to modulate but\nwhen you're on deployments you don't\nhave the option you're in gunfights\nevery yeah so as soon as you turn it off\nyou get sick right but in for me in this\nparticular instance what do I think it\nis I think it was all of those\nexperiences at once turning the\ngenerator all the way off or the\nelectric panel fully off and\nthen it just all came\nout well for people or anyone listening\nwho is facing that feeling that\nunderlying feeling or who is um\nchallenged with like a breakup a loss of\na loved one fear about the future\nlanguishing because they don't know what\nthe future holds or the feeling\nthat quote unquote so much has\nhappened or some combination of those\nfive\nthings where do you think the healing\nprocess\nstarts I hope again back to the hero's\njourney I hope hope for every single\nperson that it's not a rock bottom\nmoment but it seems like if you follow a\nlot of enough people and you hear enough\nstories um you talk with Dax right Dax\nshepher yeah he talks about it nonstop\nlike unfortunately I think a version of\nbottom is where the process\nstarts all the people I know the stories\nthey tell\nme the process started when they hit\nsome version of bottom\nwhat what's the quote that I love is um\nyou don't change until the pain of\nstaying the same is worse than the pain\nof change yeah Amen to that um I have\nexperienced that more times than I would\nlike to admit and that brings me\nactually\nto this more macroscopic question my\nunderstanding of the hero's journey from\nobviously I haven't read or listened to\nthe book is that we don't complete this\ncycle and then rest at the Ordinary\nWorld where we are\num uh living in Bliss and peace forever\nwe actually have to go around that wheel\nover and over and over again hopefully\nnot going to Bottoms that put us our\nlives in danger but um it is not a a\nprocess in which we we ever really get\nto\ncruise so let's Orient Coleman ruy in\nthat cycle um you seem to have returned\nto the Ordinary World um\nfor those listening and not watching\nyou've been whenever you describe the uh\nthe feeling of getting through but also\nthe that people assisted you you smile\nMH as friendly a guy as you are I think\nin the first three years I knew you I\ndidn't see you smile once that's\nprobably true I didn't see you smile\nonce I just thought like and these like\ndear one team guys they're they're\nserious they're locked in they're locked\nin but um you smile a lot now yeah so I\nthink you're back in the Ordinary World\nmhm um what are the things you're\nwatchful for um like like you're not\ndrinking you pay attention to your sleep\nyou always trained you always did it you\ncall it PT but physical training yeah\nyeah I Train Cycle run MH swim lots of\nkettle bells yeah every morning uh I\ntrain probably five out of seven days\nand the two days that I don't train I'm\nin I have a sauna at my house I'm in\nsauna at least for an hour mhm it's so\nfunny how uh Team guys talk about\ngetting into cold or getting in the\nsauna like it's just a regular thing\nlike they they don't they never post it\nto social media for them it's just it's\npart of the routine yeah but I say that\nbecause I think a lot of people think\nit's like this esoteric biohacking thing\nwrestlers and and uh people in the\nmilitary are accustomed to like sauna\ncold sauna cold just like cardio lifting\nweights it's not this esoteric thing no\nno I mean I think on average there's a\nsauna in Finland for like every single\nperson in the country so we didn't\ninvent some amazing recovery process by\ndoing SAA right what do you think um\nwhat do you think it is about physical\nmovement that helps the Mind obviously\nit's not it's I consider it necessary\nbut not sufficient like you you need to\ndo the talk therapy the working through\nthe writing the reading the inpe the\ntalking to other people maybe\npharmacology but it's it does seem to be\nso important for resetting us what do\nyou think it is about physical movement\nI mean since it might go back to John\nRady's little anecdote and Spark you\nknow the SE squirt I guess swims around\nthen as soon as it does whatever it\nneeds to do it just dies when it stops\nmoving oh yeah when the so the SE squirt\nis this uh aquatic animal uh apia as it\nwere that that when it um lands on a on\na rock and stops moving it actually\ndigests its own nervous system that\nmovement uh is the great Nobel prize\nwinning scientist sharington that said\nthat movement is the final common\npathway that movement is the way that\nthe nervous system tells the brain and\nrest of nervous system that it's still\nneeded here on Earth Earth H which I\nlike it's it's like a it's like a a it\nreminds us of our own utility yeah in a\nneural way I mean whatever that is\nAndrew right the chemistry and the\nneurobiology of it all this goes back\nagain going back to seventh grade I was\nat the end of the Rope on the detentions\nand the\nsuspension and I have this very clear\nmemory that before my dad got home like\nI ran laps I don't know how many but a\nlot around the block and by the time he\ngot home I was like whatever my\npunishment is I'm good like I'm not\nworried about it that physical activity\nfor me all the time I don't want to\noverdo the runner's high thing but\nwhatever that is that's what I think it\nis like when I'm in motion or my heart\nrate's\nup for the most part everything's fine\nand I'm\nclearheaded\nand I cannot be again dropping and\ndrinking I can't be lethargic and sit\naround like I have to you know take care\nof myself in that\nregard um I watch my sleep super close\nif it gets past 10:30 I'm in like a\nfull-blown panic I need to get to a\npillow the the basics like I don't do\nanything crazy really um you eat what\nyou want no no I would say on the\nneurotic scale of things that's probably\nmy most extreme there probably a little\nbit of cutting weight kind of like\neating disorder issues if I was guessing\nnot that extreme you eat meat vegetables\nyeah yeah yeah but I'm I'm a really\nlight eater I eat like a bird and\nprobably eight times a day maybe more um\neight times a day oh easily I'll have\nyou know I'll thanks to you I'll wait an\nhour and a half to have coffee which is\nmiserable um you're welcome but oh it's\namazing thank you it's helped me so much\nwell you know I I take some some uh\nsome for it because some people say\ndo I have to well if I train first thing\nthen I'll have my coffee first thing it\nwas really to stay the afternoon crash\nbut a lot of people find that\nexperiencing that natural wakeup and\nlook it's 90 minutes it's not it's not\nlike cutting out for two days or two\nweeks or Michael Paul and I think quit\ncoffee I was like why in the world would\nyou do that yeah why in the world um I\nlove coffee love yber M always have um\nfrom from from first sip which by the\nway I had my first gourd of M caffein\nMonte when I was four there's a picture\nof me and my grandfather's up hilarious\nArgentine side yeah so but the the point\nhere is that um\nyou know these practices these things I\nthink they involve a little bit of\ndiscipline but they they they really\ncan't have an outsized effect I think oh\nmy goodness yeah the it's incredible I\nmean the eating thing and then maybe you\nknow one more mental thing in this\nregard\num I'll probably\nhave maybe an avocado in the morning and\nthen two hours later maybe one hour\nlater I'll have sliced cheese and apple\nand then so you're a light Grazer really\nlight I probably have the smallest plate\nat dinner in my house um we've always\nbeen in great shape like visually you\nalways you're tall you're lean you're\nstrong yeah yeah I I think we're\nrealizing now that you can still train\non uh you have to be like gorging\noneself with calories yeah especially\nnow right like we're both approaching 50\nit's actually surprising how much I've\ndiscovered we can do on how few calories\nand I'm not trying to like test it some\ncrazy way but then just eat throughout\nthe day and you know macro life\nexperience Andre I just cut a bunch of\nextra out of my life big end\nlittle things like I don't I try to just\ndo my job and you know do a good job at\nit and hang out with my people friends\nand and family and uh all the extra\nShenanigans like I'll maybe do you know\nI was always doing some big race or some\nbig mountaineering Adventure or I was\njust piling stuff into my\nschedule I might do One race in like in\nthe spring everything else is casual I\nwork really hard at it I like cycling a\nlot it's one of my favorites and go hard\nbut I'm not trying to race cat too or\nyou know win some event\nor that release of extra in my\nlife has been as big as anything else\nand your boys presumably take some time\nand attention and you're they're great\nyeah uh um son's a runner for University\nlevel Runner\num a lot of our conversation gets to\nsome kind of\ncore uh features of Being Human and the\npsychology of Challenge and thinking one\nis or others are invincible discovering\nthat none of us are invincible but that\nwe are renewable you clearly illustrate\nthat uh there's a there's clearly a\nmessage that everyone is gleaning from\nthis many messages but um like what if\nany revision uh or um adaptation do you\nthink we need of of the concept of of\nbeing a a man growing oneself into a man\nyou know I'm not a gender studies\nsociologist psychologist neuroscientist\nbut setting all the the sociology and\nthe the nomenclature aside like if you\nhad a short list of things like seems\nlike you believe that it's important to\nbe able to do hard things mhm but\nsometimes those hard things are not the\nhard things that you are uh we think\nthey are like sitting down and telling\none story being more terrifying than\nthan going into gunfights overseas yeah\nyeah I\nmean funny that the Prelude a little bit\nis I'm not a gender study scientist\neither a sociologist I stay away from\nmost of the conversations you know\num their Barbed Wire yeah they just\npeople seem to be so overactivated over\nstuff it's very odd\num but for me in my life experience\nAndrew it's range like to use David\nEpstein's book title right it's\nrange\num and I've noticed this so much because\nof parenting and watching my boys grow\ninto\nmen if I think about come back to range\nif I think about myself at 177 or\n18 not my parents not my coaches unless\nI really wanted it you could not\ntell me what to do you can't tell me\nwhat to do now like if I want it I love\nthe mentoring and the teammate ship and\nthe things that get you where you want\nto go but if it's something I don't want\nto do I'm not doing it you know no\nmatter what and so if I think about that\nin terms of being a dad or manhood is\nlet's take it back to my kids like I\nthink one of the most important parts of\nmy\njob is to release the grip and take the\nreins off and\njust barely keep them inside the\nboundaries\nof a alive you know because they're\ngoing to make all their own decisions\nanyway and they have to right and so I\nthink a big part that I see and I saw\nmyself a lot for years was we grip\nsometimes as men like we are so afraid\nof losing control in an already\nuncontrollable world that we overgrip\neverything and I over gripped everything\nand suddenly when I'm not over gripping\nstuff things are going better and um\nwhen it comes to range it's okay for me\nit's okay to have your tough guy moments\nyour fighter mentality moments I would\nnever want to lose that because\nno matter how much help I get when I'm\nout with my family or my wife or my boys\nmy head is on a swivel and if\nsomebody touches\nthem it's\ncurtains and we need to keep that\nbecause that is just a part of life like\nyou have to be you cannot move through\nlife with blinders on like there are\npeople who are not good people and it's\nokay to have range and have that in your\ntoolkit what I don't think is okay to do\nis to let that slice of the traditional\nwhatever you want to call it aggressive\nmanhood be your whole life like that's\njust not functional you know it's not\ngood for relationships it's not good for\nParenthood so every other little tool\nyou can put in that toolbox that takes\nyou all the way over here to what we\nmight consider oh Coleman's he's soft\nnow no no don't mistake my kindness or\nweakness there's a category for\neverything and I think that makes you\nsuch a much more complete person\num it's made me a more complete person\nit's it's difficult I feel like I'm\nbrand new at being able to do other\nthings in my toolbox like you and I like\nthis part's easy I'm go jump to that in\na nanc this part over here of\nnormalizing you know life across across\na whatever 8090 is it's really hard to\nsort\nof excavate the normal but that's\nwhat I think we need to do you know I\nmean it's okay to be kind and calm and\ngentle and you know that's there's\nnothing wrong with that and I'm guessing\nthe word surrender probably held a far\ndifferent meaning for you in the past\nbut a lot of what you're describing is\nsurrendering to the realities of life\nthat we can't control\neverything and and just how painful it\nis to to undergo that surrender and and\nhere I'm talking to myself too it's been\nit's a process I'm still deeply involved\nin you know somebody who's tried to you\nknow go rung over rung as best I can\ndoesn't Andrew speak to our like\nEvolutions like that is so difficult at\nleast for me and guys like me I'm\nputting you in my group here that is so\nhard to do like that just tells me more\nabout the evolution of our male\nsystem like that part's so easy and this\npart is not so easy but man it's a it's\na battle to remind myself you know slow\ndown listen\njust the basic you don't have to go\nattack every problem like a fist\nfight it's tough it is tough and I think\nthat the more that I uh resist surrender\nthe more that um well I believe in God\nso I'll just say God but God the\nuniverse or whatever it is for people\nbut for me more that God places me in\ncircumstances that make the the uh the\nact of surrendering harder like if I\nwould just do it on my own it wouldn't\nhave to be so hard I wouldn't have to\ngood friend of mine um I've been\nmentioned by name Tim Armstrong he just\nsaid like you got to hit every branch on\nthe way down you know he was he telling\nme I had to you know he's like you're a\nstubborn punk rocker you have to and he\nwas talking about himself too like\nthere's certain there's certain\nphenotypes where we have to but but like\nthe universe just screams\nout um you don't have to you can\nactually just like lower yourself down\non a rope to the ground and walk away\nbut but then there's that stubbornness\nbut I think that the stubbornness is has\nits uh evolutionary adaptations too and\nand the hero's journey nothing in the\nhero's journey says that the transitions\nbetween these different states are\nlinear no are of equal duration are of\num\ncertainty only that they exist and that\nthere's no way as you point out before\nto skip steps you can't skip yeah I\ncouldn't skip if somebody skips Ian like\nyou hit every BR nobody skips and then\nand whether or not somebody tries to\nskip through psychedelics or through\nbeing the toughest or through the\nacquisition of money or just focusing on\nfamily you know a family obviously is\nsuper important but but that's not going\nto accomplish the other aspects of of\nthe of the journey it's a huge part of\nit but it's not it's not the only part\nagain necessary not sufficient yeah it's\nlike again it's the 12 steps are some\nI'm not that experienced in it I just\nread about it a decent amount it's like\nhitting every Branch like you got to\nfollow the steps man or you can live\nwith that low grade pain\nnon-stop you know it's that's not a good\nway to live no because because even if\nyou're not conscious of it it erods you\nin ways that are very destructive I\nwasn't conscious of it at all you know\nuntil the universe as we say came in\nwith a Wrecking Ball and said\nfine you're not going to listen sent you\nall these messages you're not going to\nlisten\nokay I think it's important that\nwe at least briefly touch on where\nthings are at right now um because it\nwould be remiss for us to give the\nimpression that like you're sitting\nthere meditating you're drinking your\ncoffee 90 minutes late late after you\nwake up you're uh sitting there in Bliss\nand thinking about all the great things\nthat happened how you made it through\nlike there's still a lot happening right\nnow so um to the extent that you can\nshare um you're working all the time\nyou're what what are you doing nowadays\nas a vocation I was in private equity\nfor a while before I met you run a\ncompany\nfor companies for really good friend of\nmine and Tom Ripley amazing\nguy and then I stepped away because I\nwas exhausted and I didn't know how to\nsay it I didn't know how to tell anybody\nlike I needed to escape again take Magic\nFlight somehow you know and\num and he and I are incredibly close\nlike he was one of the guys who is in\nthat super tight Inner Circle um and\nthen I came back to it um with you know\nwith this team that I'm on\nand I serve as the chief operating\nofficer at lid Sports Group the largest\nbrick and mortar licensed Sports\nretailer um in North America we have\n200,000 stores during the holiday we\nhave 88,200 employees and amazing team\nthe private Equity Firm that I work for\nis an amazing team and the company is an\namazing company and am just incredible\ngroup of folks\num and so yeah I work a lot I was out\nhere doing store visits in San Francisco\nand la and that's it's all good and I\nthink\num I do those little things all day long\nall the time but no I am not sitting on\na Mountaintop like most days there's no\nmeditation at all Andrew it's meditation\nis a workout Tom and I throw kettle\nbells around multiple times a week and\num I do those other little things but\nthe difference for me is I'm okay with\nit and I say that because I was\nincredibly busy you know before when I\nfirst got out of the Navy\nand I wasn't okay with it because I\nthought again this is back to the hero's\njourney I thought like the return to\nordinary life was going to be sunshine\nand rainbows like look I have the\nultimate Boon I had this big experience\nnot that I wanted to be like front and\ncenter in the media but here I am world\nit's calm out here right like we get to\nchill and have a good time and sleep and\nnothing is stressful in the real world\nright wrong I just wasn't ready for that\nlike I really genuinely thought that it\nwas just gonna be easier and so when we\ntalk about the lowgrade pain inury and\nlike the you know what is that to me\nthat was one of the biggest frictions\nlike holy I did all this stuff all\nthese deployments lost all these\nbuddies and there's no rest\nlike the regular world just it's not\nit's supposed to be easier at least\nthat's the story that was in my\nmind going through all the stuff we just\ntalked about now I'm okay with it like I\nlike it I know how to manage my life I\nknow how to manage my time for the most\npart I have a different relationship\nwith my teammates and my mentors and my\nbosses and my own work life\nand I love it like I feel like I'm back\nto in a very different way where I was\nwhen I was in the Squadron back in ' 07\nI I feel like I'm\non hope this doesn't get clipped but for\nme I'm on another level like I really\nfeel good about where I'm headed and I\nhaven't felt like that since I went into\ncollege you know I felt like was\njust deteriorating and now it's it's not\nwhich is which is\nnice well the beauty of what you just\nsaid and everything
