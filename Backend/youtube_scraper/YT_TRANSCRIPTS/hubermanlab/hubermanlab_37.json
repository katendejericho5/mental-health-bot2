    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford school of\nmedicine today we are discussing\npeptides peptides are a topic that's\nreceiving a lot of attention these days\nin part because of the excitement about\nthe so-called glp1 analoges or Agonist\nglp1 stands for glucagon like peptides\nthese are drugs used to treat type 2\ndiabetes as well as drugs used to treat\nobesity today we are not going to\ndiscuss the glp1 analogues however we\nare going to discuss some of the other\npeptides that are receiving a lot of\nattention these days including peptides\nfor tissue healing and repair as well as\npeptides that impact longevity and\nvitality now in principle any discussion\nabout peptides could be enormously vast\nand that's because there are so many\ndifferent kinds of peptides and by the\nway I will explain what a peptide is in\njust a few moments but for instance\ninsulin which is involved in regulating\nour blood sugar or blood glucose levels\nis a peptide oxytocin which is sometimes\ncalled the love hormone although I\nwouldn't say that's the best description\nof what oxytocin is it's a neuropeptide\nhormone that is involved in everything\nfrom parir bonding to socialization but\na bunch of other things as well those\nare just two examples of peptides that\nare familiar to most people at least by\nname and that exist within the tens of\nthousands if not hundreds of thousands\nof different peptides that EX exist\nwithin our brain and body today's\ndiscussion is going to focus on peptides\nthat are increasingly being used for\ntherapeutic purposes and I want to point\nout something very important about this\ntopic area first of all it is a topic\narea for which there is a lot of\nconfusion the mere naming of the\npeptides is confusing often times\nthey're referred to Simply by virtue of\nacronyms and numbers like bpc 157 or\nmk677 etc etc such that if you're not\nreally familiar with them it can be a\nbit overwhelming and Confused\ntoday I'm going to provide a very simple\norganizational framework that will allow\nyou to understand what these different\ntherapeutic peptides are why certain\nones may be advantageous for certain\npurposes of course also highlighting the\npotential risks and in some case\noutright dangers and I'll tell you how\nthey each work alone and in combination\ntoward achieving specific physical and\nin some cases even mental health goals\nI'd be remiss if I didn't say at the\noutset here that a lot of what's\nhappening with applied therapeutic\npeptide biology\nfalls into one of three categories there\nare peptides that are being prescribed\nby physicians so these are prescription\npeptides for specific purposes these are\nFDA approved there are other peptides\nthat reside in kind of a gray market\narea you can purchase them online but\nthe safety and efficacy of those\npeptides is a bit questionable in some\ncases very questionable and I'll give\nyou some filters to determine uh which\ncategory certain peptides fall into and\nthen of course there's the black market\npeptides it is possible to buy peptides\nonline through any number of different\nsources and of course I do not suggest\npeople purchase Black Market peptides\nit's very clear that a lot of them are\ncontaminated with things that both in\nthe short term but especially in the\nlong term can be problematic so if\nyou're interested in understanding or\nusing therapeutic peptides today's\nepisode is for you before we begin I'd\nlike to emphasize that this podcast is\nseparate from my teaching and research\nroles at Stanford it is however part of\nmy desire and effort to bring zero cost\nto Consumer information about science\nand science related tools to the general\npublic in keeping with that theme I'd\nlike to thank the sponsors of today's\npodcast our first sponsor is matina\nmatina makes loose leaf and ready to\ndrink yerbamate I often discuss ybba\nmate's benefits such as regulating blood\nsugar it's high antioxidant content the\nways that it can improve digestion and\npossible neuroprotective effects I also\ndrink yante because I love the taste\nwhile there are a lot of different\nchoices of yamate drinks out there I\nlove because again they have the no\nsugar variety as well as the fact that\nboth their loose leaf and their Cann\nvarieties are of the absolute best\nquality so much so that I decided to\nbecome a partial owner in the company\nalthough I must say even if they hadn't\nallowed me to do that I would be\ndrinking matina is the cleanest tasting\nand best yeram mate you can find I love\nthe taste of brewed loose leaf matina\nyerbamate and I particularly love the\ntaste of maa's new canned cold brew zero\nsugar yerbamate which I personally help\nthem develop if you'd like to try matina\ngo to drink maa.com\nhuberman right now matina is offering a\nfree one PB bag of loose leaf yerbamate\ntea and free shipping with a purchase of\ntwo cases of their cold brew yerbamate\nagain that's drink maa.com huberman to\nget the free bag of yamate loose leaf\ntea and free shipping today's episode is\nalso brought To Us by levels levels is a\nprogram that lets you see how different\nfoods and different activities and your\nsleep patterns impact your health by\ngiving you real-time feedback on your\ndiet using a continuous glucose monitor\nnow blood glucose sometimes referred to\nas blood sugar has an immediate and\nlong-term impact on your energy levels\nand your overall health one of the best\nways to maintain focus and energy\nthroughout your day as well as to keep\nyour so-called metabolic Health in best\norder is to make sure that your blood\nglucose never spikes too much nor does\nit get too low with levels you can\nmonitor how different foods and food\ncombinations impact your blood glucose\nlevels on a momentto moment basis I've\nbeen using levels for some time now and\nit's really helped me understand which\nfoods and food combinations exercise\nschedules and sleep schedules are\noptimal for my blood glucose levels and\nhow that translates to energy levels and\nother metrics of Health if you're\ninterested in learning more about

ju ju\nmakes medical grade red light therapy\ndevices now if there's one thing I've\nconsistently emphasized on this podcast\nit's the incredible role that light can\nhave on our biology and of course I'm\nalways telling people that they should\nget sunlight in their eyes as soon as\npossible possible after a waking on as\nmany days of their life as possible for\nsake of setting circadian rhythm daytime\nmood focus and alertness and improv\nsleep now in addition to sunlight red\nlight and near infrared light has been\nshown to have positive effects on\nimproving numerous aspects of Cellar and\norgan Health including faster Muscle\nRecovery improved skin health and wound\nhealing even improvements in acne or\nthat is removal of acne reducing pain\nand inflammation improving mitochondrial\nfunction and even improving vision\nitself what sets ju apart and why it's\nmy preferred red light therapy device is\nthat it has clinically proven\nwavelengths meaning it uses specific\nwavelengths of red light and near\ninfrared light in combination that\ntrigger the optimal seller adaptations\npersonally I use the ju handheld light\nboth at home and when I travel it's only\nabout the size of a sandwich it's very\nconvenient to use I also have a ju whole\nbody panel and I use that about three or\nfour times a week if you would like to\ntry ju you can go to\njv.com

a peptide a\npeptide is a small Protein that's made\nup of little chains of amino acids now\nthe moment people hear protein they\nusually think proteins that you eat or\nperhaps they think about four calories\nper gram of protein and that sort of\nthing keep in mind that we have lots of\ndifferent kinds of proteins within our\nbody that have nothing to do with the\nproteins that we eat now it is true that\nmany of the amino acids that comprise\npeptides as well as other proteins in\nthe body come from the foods that we eat\nbecause the amino acids again are the\nbuilding blocks of peptides and other\nproteins the basic way that we Define a\npeptide is that it tends to be a small\nprotein meaning chains of anywhere from\n2 to 50 amino acids that's really the\nstrict definition of a peptide however\nof often times peptides that are a\nlittle bit bigger so maybe 75 or 100\namino acids in length will also be\nconsidered a peptide now if you start\ncombining different peptides together\nyou get what's called poly peptides and\nmany of the proteins in the body are\npoly peptides so just to get a mental\nimage of what a peptide is a peptide\nbasically looks like beads on a string\nwhere there are two to 100 beads and\neach of those beads represents a\ndifferent amino acid and the arrangement\nof each amino acid relative to one\nanother that is their order along that\nstring determines what the peptide is\nand what the peptide does the other\nthing that's important to understand\nabout peptides is that some peptides are\nhormones other peptides are merely\ncalled peptides proteins others are\nneuromodulators meaning they adjust the\nactivity of neurons and some peptides\nmultitask and do many things in fact I\nthink it's fair to say that most\npeptides have what are called pleotropic\neffects meaning they affect many\ndifferent aspects of cells and this is\nvery important to understand because\nunlike a lot of our discussion on this\npodcast about dopamine or about specific\nhormones like testosterone or estrogen\nwhen we talk about peptides especially\ntherapeutic peptides often times we're\ntalking about a single peptide that does\na bunch of different things depending on\nthe cell type the time of day or night\nthat that peptide is present and even\nthe different so-called Downstream\neffects of the peptide what do I mean by\nDownstream effects well when a peptide\nbinds to a receptor on a cell surface\nokay and you can just think of that\nprocess as a little parking spot on the\nsurface of a cell and the peptide if\nit's available will bind to that\nreceptor and then set in motion a kind\nof Bucket Brigade a sort of conveyor\nbelt of cellular processes for instance\nactivating one pathway for cellular\ngrowth and another pathway for cell\nmigration for the cell to actually move\nand maybe another Pathway to talk to\nanother cell to stimulate say the growth\nof blood vessels in other words lots of\ndifferent or pleotropic effects this is\nimportant because when we're talking\nabout peptide Therapeutics rarely if\never are we talking about a very\ntargeted and very specific effect of\nthese peptides and this is important\nboth in terms of thinking about what\neffects you're going to get of taking a\ngiven peptide if you decide to do that\nas well as potential side effects as\nwell as things like how to adjust dosage\nand how long to take a peptide whether\nor not to cycle the peptide Etc so I\njust gave you a very simple description\nof what a peptide is and the fact that\nthey have pleotropic meaning many\ndifferent effects both within cells and\nacross different cell types and of\ncourse across different organ systems so\nrarely if ever will you hear that a\npeptide does one thing most often a\npeptide does anywhere from four to maybe\neven a thousand different things and\nagain we can go back to our basic\nexamples of peptides like insulin like\noxytocin and say for instance oxytocin\nit's known to be involved in milk let\ndown during lactation it's also known to\nbe involved in pair bonding in both\nmales and females as well as pair\nbonding between parent and child maybe\neven parent and pet so the point is that\nif you want a specific biological effect\nmaybe you want to repair a given injury\nor you'd like to get more growth hormone\nin order I don't know to get leaner or\nto recover from exercise more quickly or\nto feel more Vitality yes there are\npeptides that can impact those Pathways\nbut always always always if you take\npeptides especially theraputic peptides\ndesigned to promote activity within a\ngiven pathway for a specific purpose you\nare going to activate other Pathways as\nwell there's simply no way to remove the\npleotropic feature of peptide\nTherapeutics nowadays there's a lot of\ninterest and indeed growing interest in\npeptide Therapeutics and there really\nthree different paths by which people\nobtain these peptides the first is by\nprescription from a board-certified\nmedical doctor so some peptides have\nbeen approved for one use but they can\nbe prescribed also for off Lael use and\nhere we're talking about FDA approved\nclinically tested peptides but many\ncases they've been clinically tested for\none particular area of medicine so for\ninstance the peptide cellin which\npromotes the release of growth hormone\nhas been FDA approved for the treatment\nof short stature but it is often now\nprescribed for other things as well\nwhere a physician and their patient\nagree that augmenting the growth hormone\npathway would be useful now regardless\nof the specific use in mind it's\nabsolutely clear that the safest and\nbest situation if one is going to use\ntherapeutic peptides is to use\nprescription therapeutic peptides where\nthe prescription comes from a board\ncertified physician and the reason for\nthat is severalfold first of all\nsometimes these peptides come from\nPharma companies other times they are\nmade by a compounding pharmacy but in\nboth\nsituations they are cleaned of what's\ncalled Lippy polysaccharide or LPS LPS\nis something that can accumulate in the\nmanufacturing process of some of these\npeptides and it's something that you\nreally want to remove from the peptide\nbefore you ingest it or inject it most\npeptides are injected either\nsubcutaneously or into the muscle\nalthough some can be taken orally or\neven a topical cream we'll talk a little\nbit about different modes of delivery a\nlittle bit later in any case getting the\nLPS out and making sure that the peptide\nis pure is very important the reason is\nthat LPS causes an immune response and\nwhile a tiny amount of LPS might not\ncause a massive immune response the\naccumulation of many many LPs exposures\ncan start to become problematic and the\nother sources of peptides which are gray\nmarket and black market often times do\ncontain the same peptide that one would\nget from a prescription from a board\ncertified physician but very often they\nhaven't cleaned out the Lippy\npolysaccharide they haven't removed the\nLPS and that can start to create\nproblems over time and of course in the\ncase of Black Market sources especially\noften times the peptides are not what\nthey claim to be on the label or from a\nparticular source so that's especially\nproblematic so I want to be very clear\nabout my stance on this if you are going\nto explore peptide Therapeutics I highly\nhighly recommend indeed I implore you to\ndo so with a board certified physician\nand to acquire peptides through a\nreliable source where the LPS has been\nremoved which typically means from a\npharmac company or from a compounding\npharmacy okay so let's talk about\nspecific peptides for specific purposes\ntoday we're going to cover four general\nareas in which peptide Therapeutics can\nbe useful the first is for rejuven ation\nand repair of basically any tissue but\nin particular muscle and connective\ntissue so Sports type injuries but also\nthings like gut so for people that\nsuffer from IBS irritable bowel syndrome\nor from colitis or from other gut issues\nthere is a potential use for therapeutic\npeptides then we're going to discuss\ntherapeutic peptides for metabolism and\ngrowth of frankly all tissues as soon as\npeople hear metabolism and growth\ngenerally people think of fat loss and\nmuscle growth and indeed those fall\nunder this category but there are a\nbunch of other tissues for which you may\nwant to improve metabolism and perhaps\ngrowth as well so we'll get into that\nthen we'll discuss therapeutic peptides\nspecifically for longevity both staving\noff tumor growth as well as potentially\nand I want to highlight potentially\nincreasing lifespan although this is a\nvery experimental area at present and\nthen we'll talk about therapeutic\npeptides for increasing Vitality both\nmood and libido in both men and women\nokay so let's discuss peptides for\nRejuvenation and repair of tissues now\nit's pretty common to injure a given\ntissue you know to uh you know strain a\ntendon or tear a ligament or break a\nbone or I don't know any number of\ndifferent things this is just kind of\npart of life if you uh play sports or if\nyou exercise frequently sooner or later\npeople tend to get injured and when one\ndoes there's you know a lot of different\nthings one can do there's a lot of\ndebate nowadays about whether or not you\nshould emphasize cold or whether or not\nyou should emphasize heat there seems to\nbe a growing\nnow the answer to this isn't entirely\nclear and as I always say anytime you\nwant to answer a question about kind of\nthe why something evolved to be a\nparticular way you have to remember that\nneither I nor anyone else was involved\nin the design phase it's just is what it\nis so we have to be careful about making\nup just so stories about why something\nis doing what it's doing or how it got\nthere so why would there be a peptide\nwithin the gut that's involved in tissue\nhealing and repair well in order to\nunderstand that it's important to\nunderstand that the lining of your gut\nall along it length involves a bunch of\ndifferent layers of cells that turn over\nat a pretty frequent rate so unlike your\nbrain cells that for instance after\nabout age 25 you're not adding or\ndeleting many brain cells at least\nprovided there's no injury or nerve\ndegenerative disease you're not removing\na lot of those brain cells but you're\nalso not adding many brain cells there\nare few areas of the brain like the\nolfactory bulb and the dentate dryers of\nthe hippocampus where there is some\nturnover but for the most part the\nneurons you have at about age 25 are the\nneurons that you're going to have for\nthe rest of your life your gut is very\ndifferent within the millu of the gut\nyou have a lot of turnover of cells and\nthe turnover of cells in the gut is in\nmany ways the same sort of turnover\nprocess that's involved in wound healing\nand repair like if you cut your skin\nanother tissue or organ in this case\nthat involves a lot of turnover of cells\nbecause as you know if you cut your skin\nat some point it will heal up you know\nfirst there'll be a scab then that scab\nwill um give way as the tissue\nunderneath it mends and that mending of\nthe tissue is the addition of new skin\ncells as well as other cell types so the\nfact that there is a peptide in our gut\nthat can be involved in tissue turnover\nand tissue turnover is equivalent to\ntissue repair is not all that surprising\nnow it's important to understand that\nanytime we're discussing tissue\nRejuvenation that is cellular turnover\nor tissue repair so any kind of wound\nhealing a small wound or a big wound it\nalmost certainly is going to involve\nangiogenesis which is the development of\nnew vascular Supply or blood supply now\nof course vascular Supply arrives\nby capillaries veins and arteries and\ntypically when we're talking about\nangiogenesis in the context of tissue\nRejuvenation and repair we're talking\nabout the addition of new capillaries\nand or blood vessels and that means the\naddition of new what are called\nendothelial cells which are the cells\nthat make up the walls of those blood\nvessels so put simply if you want to\nrejuvenate a tissue or you want to\nrepair a tissue you need additional\nblood supply and one of the clear\neffects of bpc-157 is to both encourage\ncellular turnover as well as cellular\nmigration so new cells and cells moving\ninto a given area as well as new blood\nsupply through the promotion of this\nprocess we call angiogenesis so you can\nimagine for instance that maybe you U\ninjure your elbow and you do so in a way\nthat impacts a bunch of different\ntissues maybe some of the nerve cells\nthe neurons there are severed okay or\ncrushed so that might lead to some pain\nthere but it might also lead to some\ninability to move that joint or that\nlimb as well as you could previously\nprobably also some damage or some\ncrushing to some ligament tissue and\nsome tendon tissue maybe even to some\nmusculature a bunch of different tissues\nare impacted and one of the things that\nbpc157 has been shown to do in animal\nstudies and I really want to emphasize\nanimal studies because that's where the\nvast vast vast majority of data on\nbpc157 come from well it's been shown to\nincrease blood flow to a given area by\nvirtue of increased angiogenesis so\nbasically to promote the development of\nnew blood vessels to the entire injury\nsite and the way it does that is very\ninteresting bpc-157 somehow is able to\nrecognize injured blood vessels and\ninjured capillaries and then to promote\nthe activity of a given enzyme called\nEnos or endothelial nitric oxide\nsynthese which then causes more blood\nvasculature to form at the injury site\nand around the injury site that in turn\nallows for the delivery not just of\nblood but for the stuff that's contained\nwithin blood including growth factors\nthat then promote the further\nRejuvenation of different cell types in\nthe given area so the things that could\npotentially lead to repair of muscle\nrepair of ligament repair of tendon Etc\nand then bpc157 is known to further\nencourage the growth of capillaries and\nveins within the injury area so it both\ncalls in the development of new\nvasculature and it promotes the growth\nof that new vasculature bpc-157 is also\nknown from animal studies to encourage\nfiberblast migration and growth within a\nsite of injury fiberblast are a key cell\ntype within an injury and they provide\nsome of the really firm strong substrate\nfor bridging injuries and that allow\ndifferent things like tendons and\nligaments to restore themselves from say\ntorn or partially torn to a complete\ntendon or ligament now there's a very\nlong and kind of interesting history of\nthe use of gastric juices okay I know\nthe term uh might make a few people\nqueasy but gastric juices to promote\ntissue healing and repair now there's a\nwhole history of focusing on gast juices\nor at least the stomach environment for\nkeeping given tissues alive so that they\ncan be repaired later I know this sounds\na bit gruesome but one can find in the\nhistorical medical literature instances\nof people say severing off a finger or\neven a hand uh or things of that sort\nand then it being placed by a surgeon of\ncourse or in some cases these were\nBattlefield um situations into the gut\nas a way to preserve that finger or hand\nand keep it alive essentially and then\nto graft it back on or to make an\nattempt to graft it back on so that the\nperson could then use those fingers or\nthat hand again and while not always\nsuccessful it was clear or at least the\nidea started to form that tissues that\nwere placed inside the milu of the gut\nstood a better chance of being grafted\nback on now you could think of a number\nof different factors that could impact\nthe improved grafting of tissues placed\nin the gut until the graft could take\nplace you know it could be uh the heat\nof the environment it could be\nuh the fact that the hand or finger is\nnot exposed to things out in the world\nso less bacteria Etc nonetheless\nPhysicians were intrigued by the idea\nthat maybe something within the gut\nitself and in particular within gastric\njuices were beneficial for preserving\nand maybe even rejuvenating tissues and\none particular peptide compound turned\nout to be bpc body protection compound\nwhich again is synthesized as bpc157 so\nthere's a real logic here but what we\nhaven't really addressed is if one has\nan injury let's say the hand or um to\nthe arm or to the leg or to the ankle or\nto the Achilles tendon how is it the\nbody protection compound that normally\nwould exist within the gut actually\naccess that injured tissue now this\nStill Remains somewhat of a mystery it\nis clear that bpc 157 can exit the gut\nbut how it gets traffic to particular\nsites within the body that are injured\nstill isn't clear that said within the\ncommunity of people that use bpc157 for\ntherapeutic reasons for tissue\nRejuvenation and repair there's sort of\nbeen an ongoing debate as to whether or\nnot you can take it\nsystemically that is to inject it or\neven take it orally and that it will\nfind the sight of injury right it'll go\ndirect itself to the S side of injury or\nwhether or not it's more beneficial to\ninject it directly to the site of injury\nand here there's really no formal\nscience I want to be really clear when\nwe talk about bpc 157 we can look to a\npretty large literature of peer-reviewed\nstudies dating back to about 1993 is\nwhen the first kind of rigorous study of\nbpc 157 really began and there\nanimal literature I even would go so far\nas to say quality studies of bpc157 and\nits effects in animal models such as\nrats and mice and such a dir of formal\nrigorous exploration of bpc157 in humans\nand at the same time a gosh let's just\ncall it what it is a really rich set of\nanic data meaning that many many people\nperhaps even most people who take bpc\n157 by the way the typical route of\ntaking bpc 157 is either to inject it\nsubcutaneously or into the muscle and to\ndo that regardless of where the injury\nis they'll do that in one particular\nsite so subcutaneously just a few inches\noff the belly button or into um you know\ninto the shoulder or something of that\nsort if they're doing it intramuscularly\nor in some cases people will direct it\nto the side of injury by injecting more\nlocal like if you have an elbow injury\nthey'll put into the muscle right above\nthe elbow or subcutaneously right above\nthe elbow and we're now in a situation\nwhere we don't know if we're dealing\nwith pure placebo effect or we are\ndealing with real effects and so because\nof the lack of the human clinical\nstudies we don't know whether or not\nwe're dealing with a situation of robust\nPlacebo effects I did an episode all\nabout Placebo effects and Placebo\neffects are and can be oh so real they\nreally um can really trick you into\nthinking that a given compound is doing\nsomething when in fact it's not doing\nanything different than would an\ninjection of saline of saltwater but in\nthis case there's just such an\noverwhelming amount of what I call anic\ndata and there are so many people using\nbpc157 now and are interested in\nstarting to use bpc 157 that I'd be\nremiss if I didn't discuss it despite\nthis Gap in the human clinical\nliterature so what do we know from the\nanic data the anic data seem to indicate\nthat the mode of delivery that is\nwhether or not systemic or local doesn't\nseem to matter that much although some\npeople for whatever reason will purport\nthat local injections serve recovery of\nthe tissue more readily than systemic\ninjections now there are a couple things\nto understand about bpc 157 besides the\nfact that in animal studies it's been\nshown to increase fiberblast migration\nto a sight of injury as well as\nendothelial cell and Vascular growth to\na sight of injury and the first thing is\nthat injury seems to be important there\ndoes seem to be something that the\ninjury signals to bpc157 to create new\nvasculature and fiber blast growth there\nat the site of injury there's no\nevidence from these animal studies at\nleast to my knowledge that bpc157\nsystemically increases vascular growth\nalthough one could imagine that it might\nright and for that reason I'll talk\nabout some cautionary notes about bpc\n157 as it relates to tumor growth and\nCancers and diseases in particular of\nthe eye that involve overgrowth of\nvasculature but before I do that I want\nto talk a little bit about the safety of\nbpc-157 one of the reasons why it's\nbeing used so extensively is that it\ndoes seem to have very high safety\nprofiles at least with respect to the\nlethal dosing right in order to find out\nthe lethal dose of something as you can\nimagine unfortunately the way these\nstudies are done is they give animals\nmore and more that is higher and higher\ndoses of a given compound find out at\nwhat point about 50% of the population\nof those animals starts to die and then\nthat's the so-called ld50 at least\nthat's one crude way of describing it\nthe\nld50 of bpc 157 is incredibly High okay\nit is as high as two grams okay two\ngrams 2,000 milligrams that is per\nkilogram of body weight now that does\nnot mean please hear me on this that\ndoes not mean that any one should be\ntaking High dosages of bpc 157 the\ntypical therapeutic doses that are\nprescribed are anywhere from 300 to 500\nmicrograms\nsubcutaneously maybe two or three times\nper week and that is typically done for\na course of about eight weeks and then\npeople typically cycle off for anywhere\nfrom 8 to 10 weeks now when I say\ntypically I mean typically because there\nare individuals that take bpc 157\nconsistently they just take it every day\nand they'll just take it indefinitely\nwithout any break I think that is a bad\nidea and I want to also state that I am\nnot suggesting anyone run out and take\nbpc 157 today's episode is really about\ngiving you information so that you can\nmake the determination whether or not\nyou even want to take bpc 157 or another\npeptide and of course to really\nseriously consider the sourcing issue\nthat we talked about earlier now what\nwould be a reason to avoid taking bpc\n157 well the first relates to something\nthat many people take bpc 157 for\nbecause they believe it's good for them\nand it's some cases potentially could be\nwhich is that in addition to increasing\nfiberblast migration and angiogenesis\nblood vessel development within a sight\nof injury bpc157 is known to have a\nsmall but nonetheless meaningful impact\non upregulating growth hormone receptors\nnow this can be a good thing if you're\ntrying to upregulate growth hormone\nreceptors at a given injury site so that\ngrowth hormone which comes from the\npituitary and we'll talk a bit about\nmore later then can have a heightened\nlevel of action at that tisssue and\ngrowth hormone is involved in tissue\nturnover and repair this is evident from\nchildhood where kids heal from wounds\nmuch faster than uh adults heal from\nwounds there's other reasons why kids\nheal from wounds more quickly than\nadults that relate to things like stuff\nsecret from the thymus Etc we'll talk\nabout that as well but this idea of\nincreasing growth hormone receptors at\nthe site of injury or around the site of\ninjury by injecting bpc157 locally to\nthe injury or even taking it\nsystemically is one thing that many\npeople think of as advantageous and\nthat's why they want to take bpc 157\nhowever for some people perhaps people\nwho have a tumor in a given area an\nincrease in growth hormone receptors in\nand around the tumor could potentially\nincrease the growth of the tumor and\nthat's one of the major issues with\nbpc157 that's not often discussed which\nis that if you have a tumor and tumors\nthrive on increased blood flow because\nthey like to consume growth factors and\nincreased blood flow means increased\ngrowth factors and other things that can\nnot just sustain but actually grow the\ntumor well then by taking bpc 157 you\nmay be either maintaining or\naccelerating the growth of a tumor that\nwould otherwise be removed or stay small\nin other words bpc157 is a potential\ntumor growth risk so if you have\nknowledge of a given cancer or you're\nconcerned about tumors at all I would\nencourage you to be very cautious about\nthe use of bpc157 in fact one way that\nbpc157 creates this increase in\nangiogenesis this increase in\nvasculature is through upregulation of\nsomething called ve F vegf which is\nvascular endothelial growth factor now\nthere is a common treatment for cancers\nwhich is a vastin a vastin is a veg F\ninhibitor it's a drug that's designed to\nfight tumors to reduce tumor size and\ndoes so by inhibiting vegf whereas bpc\n157 is doing the exact opposite it is\nincreasing levels of vegf to increase\nangiogenesis so by logical extension if\nyou're concerned about tumors or cancer\nof any kind bpc 157 is probably not\nsomething that you want to explore so if\nbpc 157 carries these risks why are so\nmany people interested in taking it or\ntaking it I think in large part that's\ndue to the fact that um the anic data\nabout bpc 157 is just so strong people\nreport all sorts of things like you know\nthey recovered from their shoulder\ninjury much faster there are these kind\nof outrageous claims about people\nrecovering from complete tissue trans\nsections and um indeed there the animal\ndata are pretty impressive I went into\nthe data that looked at sciatic ner\nnerve regrowth after injury Achilles\ntendon regrowth after injury and some of\nthese studies in rats involved a\ncomplete transsection not just a partial\ntear but a complete cut of a given\nligament or tendon or nerve pathway and\nindeed the data are pretty impressive\nthat when bpc157 is applied systemically\nright so given you know at the level of\nthe gut somehow it's able to travel to\nthe side of injury recognize that\nsomething needs to be done there in\nparticular angiogenesis and fiberblast\ninfiltration and it does seem that on\naverage that these tissues repair faster\nthan they do if bpc 157 is not provided\nbut again the tumor concerns and the\nlack of human data are a real concern\nthat everyone should be made aware of I\ndo not think that bpc157 is not without\nits quote unquote side effects I do\nthink that we are now in a state of\nwidespread experimental use of bpc157\neven though it can be obtained clean\nwithout LPS from compounding pharmacies\nand by prescription there are a lot of\npeople taking bpc1 15 7 and I just want\nto return to the point I made earlier\nwhich is that you know bpc 157 is\ntypically taken in these dosages of\nabout 300 to 500 micrograms you know two\nto three times per week maybe even five\ndays per week if you're going to go down\nthis path of taking bpc 157 I would\nencourage you to take the minimal\neffective dose to not simply do it every\nday and certainly to not do it\ncontinuously and of course to monitor\nyour other health metrics for anything\nthat could potentially resemble cancer\nor tumor growth because obviously\nstimulating angiogenesis for wound\nrepair sounds like a great thing\nrecovering and being able to do your\nworkouts or play your sport or um move\nabout more comfortably of course a\nwonderfully attractive thing to do isn't\nthat what we all want but obviously not\nwith the trade-off of growing a tumor or\ndeveloping a cancer or accelerating a\ncancer I'd like to take a brief moment\nand thank one of our sponsors and that's\nag1 ag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic\ndrink that also contains adaptogens I\nstarted taking ag1 way back in 200 12\nthe reason I started taking it and the\nreason I still take it every day is that\nit ensures that I meet all of my quotas\nfor vitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for proper brain functioning\nnow of course I strive to consume\nhealthy Whole Foods for the majority of\nmy nutritional intake every single day\nbut there are a number of things in ag1\nincluding specific micronutrients that\nare hard to get from Whole Foods or at\nleast in sufficient quantities so ag1\nallows me to get the vitamins and\nminerals that I need probiotics\nprebiotics the adaptogens and critical\nmicronutrients so anytime somebody asks\nme if they were to take Just One\nsupplement what that supplement should\nbe I tell them ag1 because ag1 supports\nso many different systems within the\nbody that are involved involved in\nmental health physical health and\nperformance to try ag1 go to drink\na1.com huberman and you'll get a year\nsupply of vitamin D3 K2 and five free\ntravel packs of ag1 again that's drink\na1.com\nhuberman okay so we're still talking\nabout peptides for tissue Rejuvenation\nand repair and we spent quite a bit of\ntime on bpc157 because that's one\ngetting a lot of attention nowadays\nthere's another one that's getting\nincreasing attention that's worth\nmentioning which is thin beta 4 and a\nrelated peptide which is tb500 which is\nbasically a truncated or a shortened\nversion of the thymus and beta4 peptide\nremember the peptide are these strings\nof amino acids like beads on a string\nand thymosin beta 4 is something that\nthe body produces naturally from this\nthing called the thymus which is present\nin children and then disappears as we\nget older and it's well known again this\nis correlative but it's well known that\nchildren recover more quickly from\ninjuries and indeed the degree of tissue\nregrowth and the repair of wounds with\nminimal scarring is so much greater in\nyoung children and in children than it\nis in adults and this is what gave rise\nto the idea that perhaps some of the\npeptides that are secreted from the\nthymus such as thymus and beta 4 could\nbe involved in tissue Rejuvenation and\nrepair and that's what led to the\nlaboratory synthesis of thymus and beta\n4 the full length peptide made in a lab\nnot by the thymus and then adults take\nit okay or tb500 which is this truncated\nslightly shorten version of thymus and\nbeta 4 which acts similarly to thymus\nand beta 4 but has a kind of different\nmode of action lasts a little bit longer\nEtc now again we're in a situation where\nthere are vast amounts of animal data\nstudies on micer rats typically that\nshow that thymus and beta 4 can increase\nthe rate Andor thoroughness of wound\nhealing and repair but again there are\nmore and more people now taking thymus\nin beta 4 for the purposes of tissue\nRejuvenation and repair and Report\npositive effects now when we say\npositive effects we have to stand back\nand say well um what's the control\nexperiment you know how would they know\nhow quickly they would heal without the\nthymus and beta 4 and there simply no\nway to address that question you know my\nwhole purpose in doing this episode is\nto highlight how these different\nmolecules ought to work how they've been\nshown to work in animal models and\ntherefore how they might be working in\nhumans but again in the absence of\nclinical trials we still don't know if\nand how they are working in humans\nnonetheless a lot of people are now\nstarting to take especially tb500 it's\noften taken in commin with bpc157 and at\nthe level of mechanism the difference\nbetween bpc 157 and thymus and beta4 is\nthat thymus and beta 4 really promotes\nthe growth and infiltration of all sorts\nof different cell types associated with\ntissue Rejuvenation and especially wound\nhealing and repair it's been shown to\npromote stem cell proliferation it's\nbeen shown to increase the growth of the\nso-called extracell Matrix the stuff\naround the cells that keeps the area\naround the cells kind of rigid so that\num the tissue or the organ has more\nstability right you can't just have a\nbunch of cells with um a bunch of empty\nspace around them where they can move\nabout you want to have some rigidity to\nthe whole thing so the idea is that\nthymus in beta 4 is promoting the\naggregation of a bunch of things\nassociated with tissue healing I've\nnoticed out there that a lot of people\ntalk about tb500 that is thymus and beta\n4 in the context of being growth\npromoting as far as I know it isn't\ngrowth promoting it doesn't impact the\ngrowth hormone pathway or other Pathways\nassociate with tissue growth rather it's\ninvolved in tissue repair so what I just\ndiscussed are the two major players are\nthe two most often used peptides\nnowadays for tissue Rejuvenation and\nrepair we've got bpc 157 which you can\njust basically frame up in your mind as\npromoting angiogenesis and wound repair\nthrough a variety of mechanisms but\nmainly the addition of new vasculature\nto the wound site and then we've got\nthymosin beta 4 which is sometimes\nreferred to as tb500 which is just a\nshorter synthesized version of thymosin\nbeta 4 which is a molecule known to come\nfrom the thymus in children whether or\nnot it's solely responsible I doubt it's\nsolely responsible in fact for the\nbetter tissue healing and repair seen in\nchildren as opposed to adults we don't\nknow and yet it does seem at least\nanecdotally that people are taking tb500\nagain either alone or in combination\nwith bpc 157 and at least to their mind\nare reporting more thorough or more\nrapid tissue Rejuvenation and repair so\nthe next category of peptide effects\nthat I'd like to talk about are the\neffects of certain peptides on\nmetabolism and growth and any discussion\nabout metab abolism and growth by\ndefinition has to include a discussion\nabout growth hormon so basically where\nwe're headed is a discussion about\npeptides that can increased amounts of\ngrowth hormone that are released in our\nbrain and body to have specific effects\nin particular increases in metabolism\nand increases in either muscle growth\nand in some cases repair of tissues as\nwell although mainly muscle growth and\nfat loss for those of you that aren't\nfamiliar with growth hormone growth\nhormone is a hormone that we naturally\nmake it's secreted from a gland called\nthe pituitary gland the pituitary sits\nnear the roof of the mouth and it\nextends out of the stock of the brain\nsuch that it can release hormones into\nthe general bloodstream the pituitary is\nconnected to the brain however so it can\nget input from a brain area called the\nhypothalamus and within the hypothalamus\nthere are neurons that can send signals\nto the pituitary telling it to either\nrelease growth hormone or to suppress\nthe release of growth hormone now early\nin life when we are infants children\nteenagers and so on WE secrete tons of\ngrowth hor hormone in particular during\nthe early hours of sleep each night we\nalso secrete growth hormone a little bit\nthroughout the day but it's really in\nsleep in which we have the greatest\ndegree of growth hormone release this is\none reason why babies and kids and\nteenagers sleep so much is there's a lot\nof growth hormone release and we tend to\ngrow that is the tissues and limbs of\nour body tend to grow during sleep now\nit's been well documented that after\nabout age 30 which is typically when\npeople experience their full stature\ntheir full height although sometimes\nthere's a little bit of uh wiggle room\naround that age typically after 30 the\namount of growth hormone that's released\neach night and throughout the day is\nreduced by about 15% for every decade of\nLife as a consequence all of the things\nthat growth hormone does like\nencouraging higher metabolism fat loss\nthe growth of muscle tissue Etc is\ndramatically reduced as we go from 30 to\n40 to 50 and on and on it's also the\ncase that naturally relased growth\nhormone tends to have positive postive\neffects on our mood and overall feelings\nof well-being so it's also tied to our\nfeelings of Vitality or having feelings\nof energy to do things and that's\nbecause growth hormone potently\nincreases ATP production which is\ninvolved in Energy and Metabolism in our\ncells and as a consequence our overall\nfeelings of energy to just do things\nmental or physical now there's another\nhormone called igf-1 or insulin growth\nfactor one which is produced by the\nliver insulin growth factor 1 does many\nthings similar to growth hormone and it\nactually is Rel in response to growth\nhormone so basically the way this works\nis that there's a signal that comes from\nthe hypothalamus called growth hormone\nrelasing hormone and then that signal\nstimulates the anterior pituitary to\nrelease growth hormone growth hormone\nthen is circulated throughout the blood\nit also can access the brain itself and\nit does different things in different\ntissues but again increases ATP\nproduction for energy it is going to\ncause tissue repair in some cases it's\nalso going to encourage growth of\ntissues not just muscles but other\ntissues that's why it's involved in\nhelping us achieve our full height our\nfull stature when growth hormone reaches\nthe liver it stimulates the release of\nigf-1 which in turn does a number of\nthings that are both synergistic and\ndifferent that is it works both\nsimilarly to growth hormone and does\nsome things in parallel that are a\nlittle bit different as well in\nparticular things related to regulation\nof blood sugar metabolism Etc all things\nassociated with kind of youthfulness\nVitality and energy so it's impossible\nfor me to say that growth hormone and\nigf-1 do just one thing each they do\nlots of different things in lots of\ndifferent tissues but hopefully from the\ndescription I just gave you could see\nwhy some people might be interested in\naugmenting or increasing levels of\ngrowth hormone Now growth hormone has\nbeen sequenced and synthesized so you\ncan buy a synthetic version of growth\nhormone and indeed some people will take\nprescription growth hormone they'll take\nthis by uh typically it's an injection\nthat's given subcutaneously at night and\nthey achieve growth of tissues including\nmuscle Etc keep in mind that growth\nhormone is indiscriminate with respect\nto which tissues it grows so if you\nhappen have an existing tumor on a given\nbody part or within a given body part it\nwill encourage growth of that tumor as\nwell that's one of the reasons some\npeople are cautious about taking growth\nhormone another reason why many people\nare cautious about taking growth hormone\nis that it is subject to what's called\nnegative feedback if your blood levels\nof growth hormone are too high by virtue\nof injecting growth hormone well then\nthe pituitary can register that and the\nBrain can register that and then there's\na negative feedback that shuts down\ngrowth hormone as a consequence people\nhave developed peptide Therapeutics that\nstimulate the release of growth hormone\nand thereby the release of igf-1 but not\nby directly stimulating the growth\nhormone pathway typically what these\npeptides are are these are peptides that\nmimic the sorts of things that are\ntypically released from the hypothalamus\nonto the pituitary and in that way\nstimulate the release of growth hormone\nand downstream igf-1 so what these\nthings are typically called are\nsecretagogues these are peptide\nmolecules that have been synthesized in\na laboratory that stimulate the release\nof growth hormone and thereby stimulate\nthe production of igf-1 now there are\ntwo general categories of peptides for\nstimulating the release of growth\nhormone the first category oftentimes\nare referred to as the ghrh peptides for\ngrowth hormone releasing hormone\npeptides now that name has certain\nproblems that we'll get to in a moment\nbut let's just leave it there for the\ntime being the second category are\nWhat's called the growth hormone\nreleasing peptides right before we said\ngrowth hormone releas ing hormones\nthat's the first category second ones\nare the growth hormone releasing\npeptides you can already tell why this\nis getting confusing here's what I'm\ngoing to do rather than use that\nnomenclature which is the typical\nnomenclature that's used and I must say\nfor which there's a lot of Errors when I\nlook out there on various YouTube videos\nand I look within even some of the\nreviews that have been written people\nget things confused as to whether or not\na given peptide that one would use as a\ntherapeutic falls into one or the other\ncategory and you'll see in a minute it's\na really important distinction instead\nwhat I'm going to call these are\ncategory one peptides and Category 2\npeptides okay in general category one\npeptides are going to be the ones that\nhave been most thoroughly tested in\nhumans in some cases in fact in several\ncases are FDA approved for certain\nconditions and yes are prescribed for\nother off label effects again this would\nbe under what I'm calling type one\ngrowth hormone secreting peptides is\ncelin celin is a synthetic compound\ndesigned to mimic naturally occurring\ngrowth hormone releasing\nhormone that is FDA approved for the\ntreatment of short stature so you can\nget this by prescription sometimes it\ncomes from a compounding pharmacy other\ntimes it comes directly from PHA for the\nname brand in any case celin has been\nshown to mimic what is normally released\nfrom the hypothalamus and stimulates the\npituitary to release growth hormone and\nit does indeed cause increases in\ncirculating growth hormone and increases\nin\nigf-1 by the way the typical dosages of\ncelin that are um taken are anywhere\nfrom 200 to 400 micrograms typically\nthat's done at night before sleep for\nthe reasons that we talked about before\nand typically people will take it\nanywhere from three times per week or\nfive times per week there are some\ndisadvantages to taking it continuously\n7 days per week for long periods of time\nthere's some desensitization that can\noccur not much but some can occur so\ntaking in that way celin has been shown\nto increase circulating levels of growth\nhormone and igf-1 and the the reason why\na lot of people seek to take cellin is\nbecause they like the effects it\nproduces they like the Vitality they\nlike the muscle growth they like The Fat\nLoss um it also can increase the amount\nof deep sleep that you get I'll just be\ncompletely forthcoming I've taken cellan\non and off for the last couple of years\nI typically will take it anywhere from\none to two nights per week and I stop\ntaking it almost completely I'll still\ntake it every once in a great while but\nthe reason I stopped taking it is that I\nnoticed that it made the sleep in the\nearly part of my night very very deep\nvery robust but then I would wake up\nwide awake or I would sleep till morning\nand then at least according to my eight\nsleep sleep tracker or my whoop sleep\ntracker I wasn't getting nearly as much\nrapid eye movement sleep as I normally\nwould so at least in my case and again\nthis is anic data it seemed to sort of\nreplace rapid eye movement sleep with\nmore deep sleep and rapid eye movement\nsleep is critical for all sorts of\nthings that deep sleep can't achieve and\nvice versa so you really want both so\nthis is one reason why I've basically\nstopped taking Calin I'll occasionally\ntake it every once in a while but in\ngeneral I just you know stop taking it\nbecause uh whatever the positive effects\nmight have been if I had taken it more\nconsistently the effects in depleting\nrapid eye movement sleep were just\nsomething I didn't want and don't want\nand by the way that effect on increasing\ndeep sleep that non-r sleep is something\nthat's pretty well documented the other\nwhat I'm calling type one growth hormone\npromoting peptide is tesamorelin this\ngoes by the brand name grifta and it's\nan FDA approved drug for the reduction\nof visceral adiposity in HIV patients so\nwe have subcutaneous fat and we have\nvisceral fat around our organs visceral\nfat can be really problematic and for\nsome people who have HIV or and for\npeople who don't have HIV the deposits\nof visceral fat can be problematic for\ntheir health and tesamorelin again also\ncalled AG gria has been shown to reduce\nvisceral adiposity it also seems to\nproduce some of the other same effects\nthat celin produces the differences\nbetween the two relate to small\ndifferences in the amino acid sequence\nfor one peptide versus the other\ntesamorelin is a bit more long lasting\nthan celin and therefore is taken\ntypically about three times per week not\nfive times per week now the third most\ncommonly used peptide in this category\nof what I'm calling type one growth\nhormone secreting peptides is cjc-1295\ngosh I wish there was a um an easier\nname CJ\nc1295 is basically a variant of a\ndifferent growth hormone secreting\npeptide that was sized previously to\nwhich they add what's called a DAC a\ndrug Affinity complex it's a it's a\nsequence that makes it very longlasting\nso cjc-1295 typically is only taken\ntwice per week or even once per week\nbecause its effects on increasing growth\nhormone in igf-1 last several days which\nmay sound great to you especially if\nyou're somebody that doesn't like um\ntaking injections because these things\nuh in general have to be uh delivered by\ninjection but keep in mind that cjc-1295\nhas entered clinical trials there was a\ndeath within one of the clinical trials\nthat was related to cardiovascular\ndysfunction it's known to cause some\nfluid retention and increased fluid\nvolume which may have been related to\nthat cardiovascular death we don't know\nokay this is all kind of speculation but\nI would say if you are somebody\nconsidering using a growth hormone\nsecreting\npeptide the type one category is perhaps\nand I'll give my explanation for why I\nbelieve this to be the case perhaps the\nmost advantageous category to explore\nand as I mentioned before you've got the\noptions of cellan and tessarin both of\nwhich are FDA approved and for which\nthere's both animal and human data CJC\n1295 despite still being in clinical\ntrials does have this kind of stain of a\ndeath within the clinical trial and to\nmy mind given that there are decent\nAlternatives in serel and or tesamorelin\nI don't know why anyone would\nspecifically select cjc-1295\nuntil all these safety issues have been\nresolved I'd like to take a quick break\nto acknowledge our sponsor element\nelement is an electrolyte drink that has\neverything you need and nothing you\ndon't that means zero sugar and the\nappropriate ratios of the electrolytes\nsodium magnesium and potassium and that\ncorrect ratio of electrolytes is\nextremely important because every cell\nin your body but especially your nerve\ncells your neurons relies on\nelectrolytes in order to function\nproperly so when you're well hydrated\nand you have the appropriate amount of\nelectrolytes in your system your mental\nfunctioning and your physical\nfunctioning is improved I drink one\npacket of element dissolved in about 16\nto 32 ounces of water when when I wake\nup in the morning as well as while I\nexercise and if I've sweat a lot during\nthat exercise I often will drink a third\nelement packet dissolved in about 32\nounces of water after I exercise element\ncomes in a variety of different flavors\nall of which I find really tasty I like\nthe Citrus I like the watermelon I like\nthe raspberry frankly I can't pick just\none it also comes in chocolate and\nchocolate mint which I find tastes best\nif they are put into water dissolved and\nthen heated up I tend to do that in the\nwinter months because of course you\ndon't just need hydration on hot days\nand in the summer and spring months but\nalso in the winter when the temperatures\nare cold and the environment tends to be\ndry if you'd like to try element you can\ngo to drink element spelled\nl.com huberman to try a free sample pack\nagain that's drink element.com\nhuberman okay so there are definitely\nother synthetic growth hormone relasing\nhormone peptides that are out there but\nI think these three that we've covered\nserel and testelin and cjc-1295 account\nfor the vast majority of those i' put\ninto category one the other category\nwhich I'm going to call category two\nyou'll also hear a lot about and they\noperate a little bit differently these\npeptides encourage the release of growth\nhormone but they do so either by\nmimicking or stimulating the release of\nanother peptide called gin some of you\nmay be familiar with gin because gin is\na peptide that increases in\nconcentration when we are hungry so it\nstimulates hunger and it also stimulates\nanxiety somewhat so you may be wondering\nwhy would anyone want want to increased\nlevels of growth hormone and gin and the\nreason is that the Gin itself can impact\nthe growth hormone pathway pretty\npotently so you can get really robust\nincreases in growth hormone but because\nthere are gin increases as well you get\nbig increases in hunger and anxiety in\nsome people and lesser in others now the\ndifferent names of the peptides in this\ntype two category are ones that you'll\nhear kicked around a lot these days\nthings like ipom marelin okay so don't\nget ipom marelin confused with\ntesamorelin right tesamorelin is a type\none growth hormone relasing hormone pep\niin is in this Category 2 so it's\ndefinitely going to increase gin which\nis going to increase hunger it does have\ncertain advantages in particular that it\nincreases growth hormone release by two\nmechanisms it increases it directly and\nit tends to suppress something called\nsomatostatin somatostatin is a bit of a\nbreak or an antagonist on growth hormone\nrelease so with iper maralin you're\nessentially removing the break on growth\nhormone release allowing more growth\nhormone to be released such that you get\na lot of growth hormone released it also\ntends to really improve sleep but again\nby increasing the amount of deep sleep\nwe don't know whether or not it does\nthat to at the expense of rap and eye\nmovement sleep so iprom marelin is the\nmost commonly discussed one in this type\ntwo category the other one that you'll\nhear about is called hexarelin hexarelin\nis available by prescription and it is\nthe strongest stimulator of growth\nhormone release which leads many people\nto think okay I want hexarelin that's\nthe one that's going to give me the\nbiggest growth hormone pulse and indeed\nthe growth hormone Pulses from hexarelin\ncan be as great as two two or three\ntimes more than with the other growth\nhormone secreting peptides that we've\ntalked about however we know that\nhexarelin can also dramatically increase\nprolactin which can cause suppression in\nlibido it can cause fluid retention it\ncan cause a kind of feeling of malaise\nespecially a high levels and perhaps\nmost problematically hexarelin can\ndesensitize The receptors for growth\nhormone releasing hormone such that your\nsystem will no longer respond either to\nthe hexarelin or to any other peptide or\nperhaps most importantly to any\nendogenous that is naturally made grow\ngrowth hormone excuse me releasing\nhormone that you would make okay so\nthat's something to really consider if\nyou're going to explore hexarelin make\nsure please that you're working with a\nphysician make sure that you're not\ntaking too much of it or for too long\nand keep an eye on those prolactin\nlevels because those can be problematic\nif they get too high and you know by my\nread I can't see why anyone would use\nhigh doses of hexarelin maybe low doses\nof hexarelin if your doctor thinks\nthat's what's appropriate for you but\nyou'd really want to avoid that receptor\ndesensitization because you could\nessentially turn off the system\npermanently now there are a bunch of\nother what I'm calling type 2 growth\nhormone promoting peptides these include\nghrp2 ghrp 3 ghrp 6 again different\namino acid sequences all designed to\nachieve the same thing which is more\ngrowth hormone things like ghrp 3 can\npotently increase growth hormone but are\nknown to also potently increase\nprolactin and cortisol leading to more\nthan a doubling of circulating cortisol\nol which depending on how well regulated\nit is across the time of day can be\nproblematic in other words you want\ncortisol levels pretty high in the early\npart of the day but you want them very\nvery low in the later part of the day\nand at night and keep in mind that\nalmost always these growth hormone\npeptides whether or not they're type one\nor type two peptides are taken before\nbed typically you know 20 to 30 minutes\nbefore sleep always it's suggested that\nthey be taken at least an hour and a\nhalf after eating any food and that you\ndon't eat for at least 30 minutes\nafterwards because if you happen to have\nelevated blood sugar or you've got food\nin your gut they're not going to have as\npotent an effect at increasing growth\nhormone and igf-1 so again you want to\navoid uh food in the hour and a half\nprobably two hours before taking them\nand certainly in the half hour or uh\nlonger after which is why most people\ntake them right before going to sleep\nand add or augment that big growth\nhormone pulse that occurs in the in the\nearly part of the night and then many\npeople have perhaps heard of what's\ncalled\nmk677 which is simply an oral version a\nnon-injectable but oral version of these\nghrps and it tends to have the same\nissues that the other ghrps have which\nare elevated cortisol and in some cases\nelevated prolactin as well okay so if we\njust kind to zoom out from all this we\ncan say that yes indeed there are\nsynthetic peptides that can potently\nincrease growth hormone in\nigf-1 I explain the rationale for why\npeople would want that or perhaps to\nexplore that I'm certainly not\nsuggesting anyone um do this again I am\nsuggesting that if you do explore it you\nwork with a board certified\nphysician and that you get these\ncompounds from a quality compounding\npharmacy or by their name brand\nprescription in type one we've got\ncellin and Tess morelan both are FDA\napproved for certain purposes they're\nbeing used off label for increasing\ngrowth hormone and igf-1 for the sorts\nof things we're talking about\nhere they are taken anywhere from three\ntimes per week to five times per week\nkeep in mind tessarin lasts a little bit\nlonger than cellan CJC 1295 is the third\nin that category of type 1 growth\nhormone secreting peptides but it may\nagain may we don't know have some safety\nissues that still need to be resolved\nmaking suelin and testelin at least to\nmy mind better options should you decide\nto go down this path the type two growth\nhormone releasing peptides include\nthings like hexarelin which are very\npotent at increasing growth hormone but\ncan potentially increase other things as\nwell but of more concern is really that\nit can cause receptor defenses ation\nmaybe even turn off the whole receptor\npathway that would not be good hyper\nmorelan again increases growth hormone\ndirectly and allows more of it to be\nreleased by suppressing its break its\nnatural break which is suat Statin and\nthen the ghrp 2 3 6 and\nmk677 all of which can potently increase\ngrowth hormone need to be considered in\nlight of the fact that they cause big\nincreases in cortisol and in some cases\ncan cause some receptor internalization\nor desensitization as well although not\nas potently as hexarelin so hopefully\nthat description clarifies some of what\nyou've heard out there um about these\ndifferent compounds and their different\nnames Etc it can be very confusing I did\ntake the liberty of designating a type\none and a type two category I did that\nfor sake of clarity because there are a\nlot of different acronyms and numbers\nEtc that can be really confusing to\npeople and I hope that that will be\nuseful in facilitating further\ndiscussions about these compounds going\nforward two additional brief but\nimportant points many of the peptide\nvendors that are out there and\nPhysicians that are working with\npeptides will combine different growth\nhormone promoting peptides so they'll\nfor instance have celin or testelin in\ncombination with hexarelin or they'll\nuse iprom marelin in combination with\nCJC 1295 while I'm not opposed to that\napproach you just want to make sure that\nthe dosing or I should say the relative\ndosing of each peptide is such that you\nknow you're avoiding unnecessary\nincreases in prolactin and cortisol and\nthat you're not hitting a pathway\nredundantly that's actually the logic of\ncombining different things these\ndifferent amino acid sequences these\ndifferent peptides that is are designed\nto stimulate different modes of action\nfor the same peptide so the naturally\noccurring peptide goes and does a bunch\nof things those pleotropic effects and\nthese different peptides that are of\ndifferent amino acid sequences are\ndesigned to you know reduce uh visceral\nosity a bit more or promote deep sleep a\nbit more or to promote muscle growth a\nbit more so when people are combining\ndifferent things in cocktail it's not\nnecessarily a bad thing but you want to\nmake sure that you're working with\nsomeone who's very familiar with\npeptides you know really has been in the\npeptide space for a long time and\nunderstands how these things work alone\nand in combination and there are some\nexcellent Physicians that are doing that\num and we plan to have at least one of\nthem on the Hub Lab podcast as a guest\nin the not too distant future and you\ncan bet that this conversation will\nfacilitate your understanding of that\ndiscussion the second point is that\nthere are of course risks to taking\nanything but in particular to exploring\naugmentation of the growth hormone\npathway when people take growth hormone\nitself there are common risks such as\ncarpal tunnel syndrome um that has to do\nin part with the fact that it can\npotently increase cartilage growth there\ncan be active changes in the structure\nof one's head and face and body there's\na so-called um uh lean but distended gut\nso people that aren't carrying a lot of\nuh subcutaneous fat but that the gut\nbecomes uh extended sometimes you can\nget changes in the face like the um you\nknow kind of a a thickening of the of\nthe bone above the brow you'll see that\nand sometimes people look quite\ndifferent after taking growth hormone\nfor a series of time than they did\nbefore it can really change one's\nstature and and shape uh to a\nconsiderable degree it also can create a\nkind of a uh kind of a a skin texture\nthat is a little bit unnatural or\nunusual you sometimes can see this in\npeople that take a lot of growth hormone\nin general when people take growth\nhormone promoting peptides the changes\nin body structure are not as dramatic as\nwhen people take growth hormone itself\nself but body shape changes and cosmetic\nchanges aside keep in mind that anytime\nwe augment growth hormone either by\ntaking growth hormone directly as a\nsynthetic compound or by taking a\npeptide that increases the amount of\ngrowth hormone that we release we are\nincreasing our tumor growth risk and our\ncancer risk and that's because growth\nhormone and igf-1 are somewhat\nindiscriminant in terms of the tissues\nthat they promote the growth of so if\nyou have a tumor someplace and small\ntaking exogenous growth hormone or\nincreasing the amount of growth hormone\nthat you release by taking one of these\npeptides that we discussed will increase\nthe size of that tumor it's very likely\nand you can imagine that if you're\ntaking a peptide to increase growth\nhormone and you're taking something like\nbpc157 something that a lot of people\nare starting to do\nnowadays you could potentially increase\nboth the size and the vascularization of\na given tumor so just keep that in mind\njust as there are anti-cancer drugs that\nfocus on the vegf pathway to try and\ndiscourage\nvascularization of tumors there are\ndrugs that discourage the release of\ngrowth hormone to discourage the growth\nof tumors so if you're listening to this\nyou might be thinking well why in the\nworld would anybody take this stuff well\npeople like the effects of having\nelevated growth hormone they like the\neffects of recovering from an injury\nmore quickly but there's always going to\nbe a trade-off between potential benefit\nand potential risk the one thing that we\ncan say for these growth hormone\nsecretagogues serel and telin in\nparticular is that they are FDA appr\napproved as compounds however they are\nnot approved for all the purposes that\npeople are taking them for such as\ncosmetic effects Etc so I'm certainly\nnot being disparaging of people that\ndecide to make the choice to take these\ncompounds that's your right entirely but\nI do think that you should be informed\nabout the potential risks and if you are\nsomebody who's considering taking any of\nthese compounds there are certain\nconsiderations that you definitely\nshould pay attention to so for instance\nhow old are you if you're younger than\n30 I don't know why you'd want to\naugment growth hormone unless you and\nyour doctor decide that there's a\nclinical need or some other urgent need\nto do so uh because you're already\nmaking a lot of growth hormone if you're\nolder than 30 and you're interested in\nusing these compounds to me it stands to\nreason that of course you want to make\nsure that you don't have any tumors or\ncancers that you could potentially\nexacerbate but in addition to that that\nyou really think about using the minimal\neffective dose and that you use perhaps\neven the mildest of these different\ncompounds in order to make sure that you\ndon't desensitize any of the receptor\nPathways and of course there is no\nreason why anyone should use these\ncompounds unless they absolutely feel\nneed to and there's a potential benefit\nthere I personally as I mentioned before\ntried cellin for a short while the\nreductions in rapid eye movement sleep\nwere problematic enough for me that I\ndecided to just not take it and it's not\nsomething that I've returned to except\nevery once in a great while I might do\nit to augment deep sleep just a little\nbit the next category of peptide effects\nthat we're going to discuss are peptides\ninvolved in longevity and this is\nactually going to be a pretty quick\ndiscussion because really the main one\nin this category besides thymus and beta\n4 remember thymus and beta 4 we talked\nabout earlier this is a peptide that's\nnaturally released from the thymus and\nthe thymus is a structure that depletes\nover time as children age so some people\nwill take thymos and beta 4 as kind of a\nlongevity agent hoping that it will\nincrease repair of tissues recovery from\nexercise Etc but it's not really aimed\nat longevity per se it's really aimed at\nreplacing something that's present in\nYouth and then tends to dissipate as we\nget older that is the thymus and related\npeptides from the thymus but the big one\nin the category of peptides to\npotentially I want to highlight\npotentially\nimprov longevity is epitalon epitalon is\nalso sometimes spelled and pronounced\nepithin okay don't ask me why and as\nwith bpc 157 there are quite a few\nanimal studies exploring epithin and its\neffects on various tissues as well as\nthe naturally occurring peptide that\nit's meant to resemble epithin is a\npeptide that's secreted from the pineal\ngland the pineal gland is a gland that\nmost people associate with melatonin\nrelease and that's because the cells\nwithin the pineal called\npinealocytes secrete melatonin at night\nit's what makes us feel sleepy and go to\nsleep melatonin is suppressed by light\nviewed by the eyes there's actually a\npathway that goes from the eyes into the\nbrain there a couple of stages they go\nup through the cervical ganglion from\nthe brain stem and up to the pineal and\nsuppress melatonin release now the\npineal makes other things besides\nmelatonin it also makes a peptide called\nepithalamion\nfrom the pineal especially early in life\nand that's associated with various\nanti-inflammatory effects on other cells\nand tissues in the body and it does\nappear to be able to adjust tiir length\nwhich is a feature of cells that's\nthought to be associated with the\nlongevity of cells or how long they live\nkeep in mind that the relationship\nbetween tiir and Longevity is a\ncontroversial one people were very\nexcited about this some years back then\npeople batted down that idea showing\nthat kilometer length was not associated\nwith longevity especially in hum and now\nit's sort of a back and forth within the\nfield keep in mind that epitalon again\nalso sometimes written and pronounced\nepithin is designed to mimic this\nnaturally occurring peptide\nepithalamic clature can get a little bit\nconfusing and what you'll find is that\nepitalon is available as a synthetic\ncompound it can be obtained in clean\nform from compounding pharmacies and a\ngood number of people will use it as a\nlongevity agent based largely on animal\ndata that it can suppress tumor growth\nit can increase tiir length and to some\nextent that it can recalibrate the\nCircadian rhythm changes and the\ndisruptions in the patterns of melatonin\nthat occur as animals and perhaps as\nhumans age this is an important point\nthe pineal gland despite being very very\nsmall about the size of a PE and sitting\nkind of in the mid area of the brain for\nyou afficionados it sits you know kind\nof like right on the roof of the Dian\nsephylon\nand what it does is it it will release\nmelatonin each night in\ndarkness it can release epithalamion and\nat those times it can go and have these\nMyriad effects on restoring the brain\nand body during sleep there are other\nthings that occur during sleep that are\nessential but those are key components\nof the restorative features of sleep now\nwe know that as we age the amount of\nmelatonin that we release is decreased\nsuch that if you look in babies and\nteens Etc melatonin levels are very very\nhigh compared to people of middle age\nand of elderly age likewise epithalamion\nlevels decrease with time and as a\nconsequence markers of tissue\ninflammation also increase as we age\nbecause you're sort of removing this\nanti-inflammatory compound that's\nreleased each night now there are a\nbunch of theories as to why the pineal\nregresses with age there's some kind of\nwild ones about fluoride and a depletion\nof the of the pineal I'll do a whole\nepisode on the pineal at some point and\nwe'll explore that some of them are very\nNiche some of them are frankly\ncompletely false and others have some\nMerit and are starting to um gain some\ndata within the standard scientific\nCommunity the overall point here about\npeptides for longevity can be summarized\nvery easily the logic is just as we have\na thymus early in life the thymus\nsecretes certain things and those things\nseem to accelerate robust tissue healing\nearly in life and as the thymus\ndisappears tissue healing gets less\nrobust that's the logic for taking\nthings like thymus and beta 4\ntb500 so too we have a\nwe know about the animal studies what we\nknow about the naturally occurring\ncompounds that these peptides are\ndesigned to mimic and yet there are\nstill no clinical trials that point\ndirectly to taking x amount of epitalon\nseveral times per week as a way to\nextend life the fourth and final\ncategory of peptide effects that we're\ngoing to talk about are effects on\nVitality both mood and libido and really\nthe main players within this category of\npeptides are the so-called melanocyte\nstimulating hormon related peptides okay\njust to give you a little bit of\nbackground remember the pituitary the\npituitary gland that stalk that extends\nout of the brain and can release growth\nhormone from the anterior pituitary well\nit's got a middle segment or a medial\nsegment and there's a hormone that's\nreleased from there called mocy\nstimulating hormone melany stimulating\nhormone has the effect of stimulating\npigmentation of the skin by activating\nwhat are called melanocytes that exist\nwithin the skin so the peptides\nmelanotan 1 melanotan 2 melanotan 3\nMilan 4 Milan 5 because there are five\nof them are different peptides that is\npeptides with different amino acid\nsequences all of which mimic naturally\noccurring melany stimulating hormone but\nthat act preferentially on one set of\nmelany stimulating hormone receptors or\nanother in order to get different\neffects so let's back up a little bit\nand talk about the melanocortin system\nright the melanocortin system is a\nsystem whereby viewing light or getting\nlight on the skin typically Ultra violet\nlight of the ultraviolet B type okay\nthere's two different types of\nultraviolet light but basically sunlight\nis what the system evolved to respond to\nshown to the eyes and or to the skin\nstimulates the melanocortin system it\ngoes from the eyes to the hypothalamus\nfrom the hypothalamus to the pituitary\nand then the melany stimulating hormone\nis then released into the bloodstream\ncan travel to the melanoides and cause\npigmentation of the skin this is what is\nresponsible for SC there's also a\npathway whereby the light stimulates the\nmelany stimulating hormone system and in\nparallel stimulates the release of\ndopamine now for any of you that have\nlived in a part of the world in which\nit's very very dark with very short days\nin the winter and longer days and a lot\nof sunlight during the summer you're\nprobably familiar with the fact that\nwhen the sun comes out people start\nfeeling better they have more energy\nthey're more motivated a number of\ndifferent systems related to mood and\nlibido tend to increase this is the\nconsequence of sunlight activating the\nmelano cortico system and by the way\nthis system is very active in other\nanimals as well animals that are white\nor tend to be of pale color during the\nwinter then as spring arrives the\nsunlight stimulates this very same\nsystem and leads to darkening of the\npellage so their hair goes from white or\ngray to Brown or even dark black or some\ncombination of those and in combination\ndopamine is increased libido is\nincreased and the animals start breeding\nin the spring and summer months okay so\nthis is a a well-conserved system across\nspecies and it exists to some extent in\nus as well so there are essentially five\ndifferent synthetic peptides called\nmelanotan 1 2 3 4 and five Each of which\nis designed to mimic melany simulating\nhormone but Each of which activates\ndifferent receptors to different degrees\nand some can cross the blood brain\nbarrier and some can't and as a\nconsequence some impact mood and libido\nand others don't the simple way to look\nat this is that melanotan one does not\ncross the bloodb brain barrier\nit does however stimulate the\nmelanocytes of the skin so it leads to\ntanning or darkening of the\nskin melanotan 2 3 4 and five also lead\nto darkening the skin by way of\nactivating melanocytes in the skin but\nbecause they can cross the blood brain\nbarrier they cause effects that are at\nthe level of psychology really and at\nthe level of appetite and things of that\nsort in general the pattern is to\nincrease mood in libido and to decrease\nappetite things that are associated with\nthe transition from Winter to spring and\nsummer months in humans and in other\nanimals now one of the things about the\nuh peptide literature is that it loves\nacronyms and numbers and so there's a\npeptide\npt41 that falls into this category of\nactivating the melanocortin system and\npt-141 is also known as the prescription\ndrug VII pt41 or VII is FDA approved for\nthe treatment of premenopause fusal\nhypoactive sexual desire so this is FDA\napproved for the treatment of women that\nhave suppressed libido however men also\nwill take VII um for hypoactive uh\nsexual desire um this is obviously\nprescribed off label um by physicians\nbut keep in mind as with the other\npeptides in this pathway VII will\nstimulate pigmentation so whether or not\nyou consider that a side effect or a\nbenefit depends on I guess your Baseline\nlevel of pigmentation and how much level\nof pigmentation you actually want now\nthere are some side effects associated\nwith these compounds and one of the more\ncommon ones is nausea and that's because\nthere are melanite simulating um hormone\nreceptors all throughout the gut they\ncan also cause flushing of the skin and\nthey can cause blood pressure to\nincrease also folks with melanoma should\nbe very cautious about using any of the\npeptides that stimulate melanocytes\nbecause that could potentially\nexacerbate melanoma the next peptide in\nthis category of peptides for Vitality\nin libido is kisspeptin kisspeptin is a\npeptide that wasn't discovered that long\nago actually you can recall when the\nfirst papers about kisspeptin came out\nand basically kisspeptin is a peptide\nthat is naturally made within the brain\nand it's Upstream of some of the\nhypothalamic signals that activate the\npituitary for sake of hormone production\nand reproduction so I'll just walk you\nthrough this pathway it's actually quite\nsimple you've got the pituitary you're\nnow familiar with the pituitary and the\npituitary releases two different hormon\nhormones in both males and females it\nreleases lutenizing hormone and it\nreleases follicle stimulating hormone if\nyou watched the episodes that we did\nabout testosterone and estrogen if you\nwatch the episode that I did on male and\nfemale fertility if you watch the\nepisode that I did with Dr Michael\nEisenberg from Stanford or Dr Natalie\nCrawford who's an OBGYN uh specializing\ninfertility we talked a lot about LH and\nFSH basically FSH as the name suggests\nstimulates the growth of the follicle\nthe egg in the female and it stimulat\nAtes sperm production in males\nlutenizing hormone stimulates\ntestosterone production from the gonad\nin males and it also stimulates estrogen\nproduction and to some extent\ntestosterone production in females as\nwell so we need LH and FSH to stimulate\nthe gonads the ovary or the testes the\nhormone that stimulates LH and FSH\nrelease is called GnRH or gatot tropin\nreleasing hormone and it comes from the\nhypothalamus so G&R is a signal that\npromotes LH and FSH release now that\nraises the question what turns on GnRH\nand the signal that turns on G&R is\nkisspeptin kisspeptin in other words is\nfurther Upstream from G&R and lsh and\nFSH it's a Cascade it goes kisspeptin\nGnRH LH FSH testosterone estrogen okay\nthat's the pathway now it's very clear\nthat kisspeptin is involved in the\nactivation of puberty the transition\nfrom prepubertal to postpubertal stages\nof life it's also involved in any of the\nsort of Downstream effects of having\nelevated LH and FSH including elevated\nVitality which includes both energy and\nin some cases libido so there's\nnaturally occurring kisspeptin and\nthere's now synthetically generated\nkisspeptin designed to mimic naturally\noccurring kisspeptin and it's actually\nprescribed for what's called\nhypothalamic amena hypothalamic amena is\nthe loss or the absence of periods of\ncycles that are the consequence of\ndeficits within the hypothalamus itself\nso not something within the ovary or a\nlack of the pituitary to make LH or FSH\nbut a deficit of the hypothalamus to\npromote LH and FSH and the downstream\nhormones testosterone and estrogen\nincidentally there are also kisspeptin\nantagonists okay drugs that are designed\nto suppress kisspeptin and those are\nused to treat some of the symptoms of\nmenopause including night sweats and\nsome of the what are called vasomotor\nsymptoms so peptin is obviously a key\nplayer in this whole pathway of steroid\nhormone release the steroid hormones\nbeing testosterone and estrogen there\nare other steroid hormones as well of\ncourse now there are folks within the\nlandscape of peptide Therapeutics folks\nmeaning Physicians and other\npractitioners who said ah well here's a\na peptide that is known to promote all\nthese hormone Pathways that are\nassociated with Vitality libido Etc and\nso there are people who take kisspeptin\npeptides as a way to stimulate these\nPathways and they're doing so for the\nspecific purpose of increasing ing\nVitality as it relates to libido and\nmood and to get the downstream increases\non testosterone and estrogen and of\ncourse some people are taking kisspeptin\npeptides to treat hypothalamic\namenorrhea and as I mentioned some\npeople are taking kisspeptin antagonist\nthey're trying to block the kisspeptin\npathway in order to reduce some of the\nvasomotor and other symptoms of\nmenopause I will say despite the fact\nthat the ceptin pathway is well known\nand despite the fact that the ceptin\npeptide is designed to mimic a naturally\noccurring peptide that has a pretty\nconstrained set of function\nin the hypothalamic pituitary system and\ntheir Downstream effects on the\ngonads the use of Kiss peptin to\nincrease Vitality in libido is a bit of\na um let's just say it's it's a little\nbit of a wild card we don't yet know all\nthe effects of kiss peptin again it was\nfairly recently discovered we have it in\nmind that it's involved in these\nPathways but I should say every time we\nlook at a given peptide whether or not\nit's gin or hypocrite neurexin or it's\nglp1 what we find is that again are\nthese pleotropic effects there is rarely\nif ever one specific effect and it's not\njust a concern about side effects that\nwe want to take these pleotropic effects\ninto consideration it's the fact that\neven though we know a lot about the\nhuman body and the various hormones and\nneuromodulators like dopamine serotonin\nEtc that are made this landscape of\npeptides is an enormous one and it's one\nfor which we are just now really\nstarting to appreciate how many\ndifferent peptides the human body and\nbrain make again I don't think it's an\noverestimate to say that they probably\nhundreds of thousands of different\npeptides each with multiple and\nsometimes even overlapping and\nsynergistic effects so I do understand\nthe excitement about peptide\nTherapeutics I think for a lot of people\nthat want to improve their physical\nhealth and mental health they want to\nrecover from injuries more quickly maybe\nthey're seeking particular aesthetic\nchanges or mood changes Etc I understand\nthe gravitational pull and the\nexcitement of peptides but I have\nnoticed that the discussion around\npeptides because it's in contrast often\nto the disc discussion around hormone\ntherapies like testosterone therapy and\nestrogen\ntherapy people I think inadvertently\nassume that peptides are all safe or\ninnocuous or that they are potent enough\nto do certain things that we want but\nthat because they're not hormone\ntherapies per se that they are free of\nside effects and risk and in addition to\nwanting to teach you about some of the\nbiology of these peptides and how they\nwork and what they're designed to do as\nwell as some of their potential\ntherapeutic benefits under the right\ncondition again working with a really\ngood board certified physician and\nmaking sure that the sourcing is really\nclean and that you're doing regular\nblood testing and you're monitoring for\nany potential tumor growth Etc I also\nwant to emphasize that these are very\npotent compounds they have lots of\ndifferent effects and we are in the\nearly stages of exploring peptide\nTherapeutics again I'm not here to tell\nyou what to do or what not to do but if\nyou have it in mind that peptide\nTherapeutics because they aren't hormone\ntherapies are not without their\npotential risks you would be wrong all\nthat said it's very exciting to see\nwhat's happening with peptide\nTherapeutics I'm excited about their\npotential for both the treatment of\ndisease as well as for augmentation of\nmental and physical health and I think\nit's an exciting landscape that\ncertainly motivated my desire to do this\nepisode and get you familiar with them\nor at least with
