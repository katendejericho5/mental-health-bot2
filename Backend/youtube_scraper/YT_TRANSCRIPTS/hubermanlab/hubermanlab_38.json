    "transcript": "welcome to the huberman Lab podcast\nwhere we discuss science and\nscience-based tools for everyday\n[Music]\nlife I'm Andrew huberman and I'm a\nprofessor of neurobiology and\nOpthalmology at Stanford School of\nMedicine my guest today is AI wind AI\nwind is one of the top magicians and\nmentalists in the world now you may be\nasking yourself why would the hubman Lab\npodcast host a magician Mentalist and\nthe obvious answer perhaps would be that\nmag magicians and mentalists reveal to\nus where our gaps in perception reside\nthat is where the human brain falters\nsuch that magicians and mentalists can\ntake advantage of that and give us the\nimpression the illusion that certain\nthings happened when they didn't however\nduring today's discussion you will learn\nthat AI wins magic and Mentalist work\nwhich by the way is absolutely\nastonishing you can see examples of this\nin some of the links in the show note\ncaptions that will take you to YouTube\nclips in which aie did some of these\ntricks and mentally work on me directly\nin the studio and there are other\nexamples out there that we've linked to\non the internet as well that the work\nthat aiwin does illustrates how we form\nmemories how we erase memories and the\nspecific things that we all can do in\norder to stamp down certain memories and\nto erase other memories indeed much of\nwhat aie wi's work does is to use an\nunderstanding of how the brain works in\norder to create false memories to erase\nrecent memories and indeed to use\nemotion and empathy and storytelling in\norder for you the Observer to create a\nperception of something that happened\nthat may or may not have actually\nhappened indeed what AI reveals to us\ntoday tells us not how a magician or\nMentalist fools us but rather how we\nwith our own brains lead ourselves to\nbelieve that certain things happened\nwhen in fact they may or may not have\nhappened and the way that we collaborate\nwith others in order to create those\neither false or real perceptions it's a\ndiscussion that I'm sure everyone\nwhether or not you're a fan of magic or\nnot will find fascinating indeed I learn\nso much from the discussion with AI\nabout neuroscience and about how the\nhuman brain constructs narratives of the\npast present and future that it informs\nnot just my understanding of how the\nbrain works but indeed how to learn\nbetter how to remember things better and\nto consolidate that information to\nreally stamp it into your memory so that\nyou never forget so while AI wind is a\nmagician and Mentalist today's\ndiscussion is really a discussion about\nthe Neuroscience of how to learn how to\nforget how to access creativity and how\nart and storytelling empathy and emotion\nall can allow us to access powers within\nus that make us far more effective in\nwhatever Pursuits we may be after before\nwe begin I'd like to emphasize that this\npodcast is separate from my teaching and\nresearch roles at Stanford it is however\npart of my desire and effort to bring\nzero cost to Consumer information about\nscience and science related tools tools\nto the general public in keeping with\nthat theme I'd like to thank the\nsponsors of today's podcast our first\nsponsor is element element is an\nelectrolyte drink with everything you\nneed and nothing you don't that means\nplenty of salt magnesium and potassium\nthe electrolytes but no sugar as I've\nmentioned before on this podcast I'm a\nbig believer in getting sufficient\nhydration and making sure that that\nhydration includes sufficient\nelectrolytes salt magnesium and\npotassium and the reason for that is\nthat all the cells in our body but\nindeed especially our neurons our nerve\ncells are critically reliant on\nelectrolytes and hydration in order to\nfunction properly element makes it very\neasy to get the hydration and\nelectrolytes you need when I wake up in\nthe morning one of the first things I do\nis to drink 16 to 32 ounces of water\nwith a packet of element dissolved in it\nI particularly like the raspberry\nflavored element but then again I also\nlike the watermelon flavor and the\nCitrus flavor and the orange flavor so\nbasically what I'm saying is I really\nlike all the flavors of element if you'd\nlike toy element you can go to drink\nelement spelled LM nt.com

licensed\ntherapist carried out online now I've\nbeen going to therapy for well over 30\nyears initially I didn't have a choice\nit was a condition of being allowed to\nstay in school but pretty soon I\nrealized that therapy is extremely\nvaluable in fact I consider doing\nregular therapy just as important as\ngetting regular exercise including\ncardiovascular exercise and resistance\ntraining which of course I also do every\nweek the reason I know therapy is so\nvaluable is that if you can find a\ntherapist with whom you can develop a\nreally good rapport you not only get\nterrific support for some of the\nchallenges in your life but you also can\nderive tremendous insights from that\ntherapy insights that can allow you to\nbetter not just your emotional life and\nyour relationship life but of of course\nalso the relationship to yourself and to\nyour professional life to all sorts of\ncareer goals in fact I see therapy is\none of the key components for meshing\ntogether all aspects of one's life and\nbeing able to really direct one's focus\nand attention toward what really matters\nif you'd like to try betterhelp go to\nbetterhelp.com huberman to get 10% off\nyour first month

I first learned about\nAeropress well over 10 years ago and\nI've been using one ever since Aeropress\nwas developed by Alan Adler who was an\nengineer at Stanford and I knew of Allan\nbecause he had also built the so-called\naobi frisbee so he was sort of famous in\nour community for developing these\ndifferent Feats of engineering that\nturned into commercial products now I\nlove coffee I'm somebody that drinks\ncoffee nearly every day usually about 90\nto 120 minutes after I wake up in the\nmorning although not always sometimes if\nI'm going to exercise I'll drink coffee\nfirst thing in the morning but I love\nlove love coffee and what I've\npersonally found is that by using the\nAero press I can make the best possible\ntasting cup of coffee I don't know what\nexactly it is in the Aeropress that\nallows the same beans to be prepared\ninto a cup of coffee that tastes that\nmuch better as compared to any other\nform of Brewing that coffee even the\ntraditional French press the aerrow\nPress is extremely easy to use and it's\nextremely compact in fact I take it with\nme whenever I travel and I use it on the\nroad in hotels even on planes I'll just\nask for some hot water and I'll Brew my\ncoffee or tea right there on the plane\nwith over 55,000 fstar reviews Aeropress\nis the best reviewed coffee press in the\nworld if you would like to try Aero\npress you can go to Aero

live\nshows twice once in Los Angeles once in\nNew York and both times there were three\nmajor effects first of all I was\nabsolutely astonished there's truly no\nhyper herbally that can capture what you\nare capable of doing um just by way of\nexample folks prior to coming in here\naie agreed to do a trick he let me\nselect a card uh an Ace of Hearts from a\ndeck of cards I held it there was\nanother card ace of diamonds I also held\nthat I looked at them I turned them over\nin my hands he's not touching them he\nasked somebody in the room for a number\nnumber number everyone provides a number\nthen he ask me which person's number I\nwould like to select there's\nno prior agreements or communication\nhere\nwhatsoever I selected the number seven\nhe says turn over the cards that are\nstill in my hands he hasn't touched me I\nturn over the cards and now they are\nsevens not\nAces unbelievable and uh and yet it\nhappened and that's but a minor example\nof the sorts of things that you do so\nthat's the first thing absolutely\nastonishing two you involve many of the\nsenses not just visual perception memory\nEtc but many of the senses and groups of\npeople you are able to somehow create\nPerceptions in people or perhaps these\nperceptions are accurate that certain\nthings have happened and everyone agrees\nthat these things happen so it's not\njust one person being quote unquote\ntricked and then the third is that you\nand I both share a fascination with the\nhuman mind and perception which is\nreally one of the main reasons why\nyou're you're here today because you are\na scientist uh who I believe understands\nhow perception\nWorks understands the gaps in perception\nand memory and understands these things\nat a practical level that no\nneuroscientist not I nor anyone else who\ncould tell you about the nuts and bolts\nof the brain and nervous system could\never approach so welcome I'm super\nexcited for our conversation and my\nfirst\nquestion is when you do a trick with one\nperson with many\npeople how confident are you that you're\ngoing to get the answer correct meaning\nare you always operating at the level of\n100% certainty that you're going to get\nit right or rather is there a little bit\nof a gap are you running a like a 90%\nprobability um and the reason I start\nwith this question is that I think it's\na very different situation when The\nMentalist the magician\nis certain it's going to work out as\nopposed to when it's not and I think\nit's the dynamic tension of the\npossibility that it might not work out\nthat gets everyone so engrossed in what\nyou do yes so um first of all a lot of\npeople think do you ever fail do you\never get it wrong and the truth is\nthere's something they don't know we're\ngoing to reveal some Secrets here um a\nlot of people don't know that we are\nvery much like jazz musicians I'm not a\nmusician I'm going to probably butcher\nthis\nanalogy here but we write the story as\nit goes in other words you might see me\ndo a trick and think that's what I do\nevery day but I don't so in other words\nif something goes wrong because every\nperson is really\nunpredictable uh I said take a card\nmaybe I'm trying to make you take a\ncertain card maybe I'm trying to\ninfluence you and you're not going for\nit I'm okay with making a little detour\nyou just don't know I'm taking a detour\nand I'm improvising and I we'll go\nsomewhere else and I'm okay with that so\na lot of the magic that I love to do we\ncall it Jazzy magic is Magic that\nliterally gets written as we go but I'm\nthe only one who knows it uh and you go\nwow it's concluded beautifully right so\nthere's there's some times when I like\nafter a show and I and I go wow this did\nnot work and that didn't work and people\nsay what do you mean everything worked\nperfect they don't know what I see is a\nlittle different than what you see so in\nthat sense when you're an amateur\nmagician you're just starting out and\nyou don't have you know the experience\nyou can literally just get stuck and go\nsorry let's do it again and it could\nhappen but for a season you know a\nseason performer someone who does it\nagain and again and again I I'll borrow\nfrom a pendulate analogy that I love\nit's like gr Hog Day the movie uh we get\nto relive the same night again and again\nand again and guess what what people are\nvery much alike I'll hear the same\nhackling I'll hear the same thing or I I\nI start to see types this person is\ngoing to be confrontational this person\nis going to be is is a person who\nbelieves maybe in Supernatural everybody\nhas a Vibe and you know even though I'm\nnot a scientist I'm not a psychologist\nuh I don't have any degrees in any of\nthose but I'm a practitioner of\npsychology I tried the same trick a\nmillion times and I start to see\npatterns Behavior\npatterns that I can use to my advantage\nlike for example I noticed that it's\neasier to fool smart people as opposed\nto people are not so smart tell me more\nabout that because you know I'm relying\non the bank of information you have in\nyour head against you it's ta chi I know\nwhat you know and I know that whenever\nyou view anything you have to fill in\nthe blanks with lots of information I\nshow you a couple of things and you say\nokay this makes sense this and I know\nhow you think and the fact that I an\nidea of what you know and what you don't\nknow I can use it against you and that's\na beautiful concept right as opposed to\nsomeone who's not so educ I don't know\nwhat he knows and they tend to think\nvery simple and they're the ones to\nfigure out magic the most because they\ndon't fill in the blanks they take it\nfor what it is uh you telling yourself a\nbetter story you enriching The\nExperience based on all this the wealth\nof information you have about psychology\nand how this works and how perception\nworks and how memory works for example\nyou just described the trick I did for\nyou you did not describ the trick you\ndescribed your your memory of that trick\nso my job you know and I'm boring from\nmy master myestro Juan tamari who's my\nfavorite Magician of all time and I\nconsider him we'll talk about him quite\na bit now um he taught me so much but he\nhe talks a lot about memory like we are\nfirst first of all we encoding the\ninformation I give you something to\nencode then I'm asking you to store it\neither in short term memory medium-term\nlong-term uh I don't know if it's even a\nreal term but a chemical uh memory right\nwhen it gets embedded in your memory and\nthen I'm trying to\nmanipulate how you're going to recall\nthe experience and what you did you\ndescribed my trick in a way that I could\nnever do I wish I could perform the\ntrick you just described I can't but I\nwas trying to create at least the\nimpression you recorded a feeling you\nhad you did not record what you saw and\nexperienced you recorded a\nfeeling it felt so amazing that the\nfeeling was coted in the memory as well\nand therefore you you were the co-author\nof that trick you you help me fool\nyou I'm very curious about the role of\nemotion in the co-authoring of these\ntricks and by the way folks the\nconversation we're having today is not\njust about magic tricks and\nmentalists this occurs at the level of\ninteractions between\npeople one to one this occurs at the\nlevel of media to the general audience\nof the world this stuff scales uh at\nevery level and in every domain of Life\nwe'll get to how that exactly that\noccurs I wonder if I could ask you about\nthe verse engineering of a trick a\nhypothetical trick sure sure sure so\ntell me if this trick is possible and if\nso one of the possible ways that you\nwould do this um I I think I've seen you\ndo something similar to this or other\nmentalists do something similar to this\nyou're standing in a room full of people\nlet's say 50 people and you have a piece\nof paper and a pen and you say okay I'm\ngoing to write down a series of numbers\nand you write them down you fold it up\nyou put it on a table next year you set\nthe pen down there's no contact with it\nanymore and then you go around the room\nand you just ask people for numbers\nbetween 1 and 25 you ask a certain\nnumber of people and then somehow you\nreturn to the paper you open it up and\nthat's the sequence of numbers that it\nseems like a straightforward but\nastonishing trick it's a classic a\nclassic okay classic of magic for people\nlike me we want to know at least one\nsolution to that challenge how does\nwhat's one way in which a magician could\ndo that obviously we start to go to the\nphysical explanation okay somebody\nunderneath the table that the piece of\npaper was on wrote down the numbers they\nheard and put it on the table uh another\nsolution would be that there was a stack\nof papers up there with any number of\ndifferent combinations but then it's a\nvery large number big stack of paper\nthen it becomes hard to hide and on and\non um all going in the wrong direction\nof course um I can also think of the\nend uh product way of doing this where\nthe piece of paper that you show has the\nnumbers that the people stated but\nsomehow we think it's those numbers when\nit's actually other numbers like there's\nsome sort of visual illusion that we all\nagree on seeing but here I'm just\nguessing so how could one do that trick\nwow we need two hours to dissect this\none um so here's a deal I just noticed\nsomething as you were going through all\nthe options is someone I assume you're\nnot a magician no um I just realized\nthat a quality of magic is that it\nignites your imagination and your\ncreativity you just basically saw\nsomething that has no explanation and\nyou're a knowledgeable guy you know a\nlot about a lot of things and it in a\nweird in a good way it bothers\nyou why don't I know that answer I know\nso much about the mind and how we sleep\nand how we you know how certain\nexercises affect our bodies and blah\nblah blah but this series of number I\ndon't know and that drives you nuts a\nbit but it's good cuz then your mind\nstarts racing and and thinking of\neverything you said is a wonderful\nexercise in uh problem solving right how\ncould be achieved and then you slowly\nruled them out as too much paper too\nmuch work hiring somebody under a table\nto write maybe a solution but you have\nto pay somebody just to do that job um\nbut it's nice because um we're teasing\nthe mind we're teasing we're challenging\nthe mind in an era where it seems like\nall the information is out there we have\nI my smartphone can do you know more\nthan my first computer could right in in\nmy pocket so we are we are up against\nand by every time I I tell you this it's\na bit of a tangent here um every time\ntechnology\nadvances magicians get scared say oh I\npeople are when they can do all these\nmarvelous things I mean how are they\ngoing to care about the number you just\nspoke or or carard changing in my hand\nand I attribute that to again your\ndesire to see something\nmarvelous without by the way there's\nthere are people that don't want to see\nmagic like I do something that's really\nis seems impossible and they go slide of\nhand they they come up with a very\nsimple solution they not need picking\nabout exactly how you did it they go oh\nhe's fast he's fast with his hands or\nyou know they come up with a very simple\nsolution that I don't know why it\nsatisfies them but it does and it's\nbecause they lack the desire to see\nmagic so to\nme again and we're going back to the\nco-authoring I really need someone a\npartner when I whenever I do magic that\nsomeone has this desire to see something\nthat's beautiful\nthat's going to bend the rules of what\nwe know is possible right and they're\njoining me so to your question how is it\ndone there's many many uh ways to\nachieve this effect and because we don't\npossess I don't we can talk about this\nif you want about the supernatural I\ndon't believe that anybody possesses\nSupernatural powers or even close to\nthat um and because of that\nwe we have to ch eat we have to do some\ndirty work which I don't want you to\nknow about um and so in other words\nevery trick that I do has a little scar\na little a moment I wish did not exist\nand by the way a magician when they\nchoose a trick like that they need to\nsay oh I can go this route or this route\nthey're going to pay a price with this\nversion Oh I cannot do it this way here\nI it's not as clean here I cannot be as\ndirect here I have to choose maybe\ncertain people in the the audience again\nI'm tiptoeing around it so I don't\nreveal how it's done um but you're\nmaking a sacrifice with every choice you\nmake the goal is at the end to make\nsomebody as smart as you go how how and\nthen start racing and and at the end you\nreach a dead end\nhopefully it's\nmagic you\nExcel and I enjoyed it and and that's I\nwant you to surrender and and it's a\nsurrender it's not uh you're not being\ndefeated you you you give into the to\nthis place where magic could happen you\nyou make room for something that should\nnot happen in this world to happen and\nand that's why I love magic so much it\nit is a a bit of a reminder that I'll\ntell you a story there is a joggler who\nis not a magician he's and and I'm not\ngoing to mention names for a reason so\nhe juggles on the streets and you know\nmake some money on the streets and one\nday he goes to see a magic\nshow and the magic the magician\nwonderful magician uh who does this\nwonderful act it's the ZIP code act he\nsays to people um tell me your zip code\nand then he tells them where they live\ntell me where you live he tells them the\nzip code and then he describes places\naround them oh you have a Starbucks\nthere and blah blah and like he describe\nit's amazing it's wonderful now this\njoggler not a magician watches a\nmagician who is doing a trick there's a\nscientific explanation to how it's done\nit's not it's not anything beyond that\num and again it's\nwonderful and he goes how did he do that\nand then he comes up with the solution\nthat the magician must havee memorized\nall the ZIP codes in the\nworld not the case but that's the\nimpression he goes home\nand starts memorizing all the ZIP codes\nin America\nfirst he spends thousands of hours to\nmemorize zip codes for real he's doing\nthe real version of what the magician\ndid and he performs it now all over the\ncountry he's doing the ZIP code act for\nreal and the beauty of this story is\nthat a false performance artificial\npresent representation of a skill\ninspired somebody to do something that\nis real and therefore push his limits is\nhuman you know realistic limits to a\nlevel that a lot of people go that's not\npossible right and and I think it's a\nbeauty about this and again goes back to\nyour question how is it done so maybe\nthe solution you just came up with is\nbetter than what I do but I least ignite\nyou to to think about it so I it's it's\nit's really a a big reason uh an\nimportant reason why I love magic so\nmuch staying with my question of how a\ntrick like that is done you really want\nto know well I don't think you're\nactually going to tell me the specific\norder of operations to make it happen I\nI don't expect that but I can think of\num two kind of um end points for\nexploring this one is or at least two\none is to manipulate what's\non the paper right like the other is to\nmanipulate what people say or are likely\nto say perhaps by selecting people that\nare likely to say certain numbers\nbecause you have some understanding of\nthat I don't know how that would happen\nthe other is to completely revise\npeople's understanding of what just\nhappened in a group and I think the last\npossibility is the one that intrigues me\nand most people the most the idea that\neven in the company of other rational\nwell-rested sober meaning non-\ninebriated or on drugs people that\nsometimes it helps that there's a there\ncould be a\ncollective perception that is not\naccurate but everyone agrees to\nconfabulate together and the reason I\nask this and I focus on this third\npossibility is that we know that the\nmemory system is a confabulation system\ncorrect a good example of this would be\npeople who sadly have some form of\ndementia they often will find themselves\nin a room doing something and if you ask\nthem hey what were you doing they don't\nsay I don't know they say oh you know I\ncame in here to do something and they\ncreate these elaborate stories of what\ngot them there which may make sense to\nthem might not um but we all do this we\nall confabulate false memories there is\na huge topic into itself but um we all\nconfabulate memory is not perfect so um\nI imagine this third possibility is one\nthat you work with and that you massage\num how does one think about memory in\nthe context of these experiments that uh\nI just called them experiments these\ntricks that you do I like by I love that\nword right and and here we agreed that\nwe're were going to talk about science\ntoday as we always do when whenever I\nsee you um and in experiments as people\nmay or may not know you ask a question\nbut you pose hypotheses so you say like\nhow do we cure cancer but then you pose\na hypothesis you say I think it's going\nto be cured by doing blank blank and\nblank and then you test that and you try\nand rule out your hypothesis it's a\nlittle bit of why I call it an\nexperiment um so for instance um is\nthere a way that you can get people to\nbelieve that they saw the numbers let's\nmake it very simple 3 8 and seven when\nin fact you held up a piece of paper\nthat said something very different is\nthat have you done that before I I I see\nwhere you're going with this uh and I\nand I love use the word experiments one\nof my heroes Chan\nCanasta was a psychologist who who used\npsychology in his work uh as a magician\nas a mentalist and he didn't he never\ncalled his pieces uh tricks or magic he\ncalled them\nexperiments and he was careful about it\nhe it's not just uh an aesthetic Choice\nhe wanted to to plant this SE\nin their mind experiment means it could\nfail okay which is a very good starting\npoint for any dramatic uh because if\nsomething is going to work and but if\nthere's something at stake something\ncould fail people are more engaged so I\nlove the word I sometimes use the word\nuh what's an experiment yeah it's like a\nthese um crazy people that climb up the\nside of buildings with no ropes I mean\nwe don't want to see them fall but the\npossibility that they could fall is\nwhat's exciting the the movie free solo\ncor with Alex hell we all know at the\nbeginning he\nlives he he lives and yet you want to\nsee it in case he might not live and\neven though you know he lives in some\nways that's a a magic trick into itself\nthat's the Brilliance of David Blaine\nwho I consider one of my dearest friend\nand my one of my favorite magicians in\nthe world and what he does I mean we can\ntalk about him at length but you know\nblending real stuff with magic and it's\nalmost sometimes it's hard to tell what\nis real and what's not and I I I even\nlove that aspect and a lot of people\ndon't know but all the stuff he does is\nreal when he's holding his breath night\nafter night in now in vegus at the wind\n10 minutes and you know sitting uh in\nthe audience watching David do that is\nso\ninspiring because I look at it\nsymbolically he is is showing us cuz he\nwas inspired by a kid who survived um\nbeing trapped under ice for a long time\nin recovered to full recovery and and he\ngoes if he can do it then everybody\ncould and it's it's a beautiful to meets\nthe message is so strong just beautiful\nI'd like to take a brief moment and\nthank one of our sponsors and that's ag1\nag1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink\nthat also contains adaptogens I started\ntaking ag1 way back in 2012 the reason I\nstarted taking it and the reason I still\ntake it every day is that it ensures\nthat I meet all of my quotas for\nvitamins and minerals and it ensures\nthat I get enough Prebiotic and\nprobiotic to support gut health now gut\nhealth is something that over the last\n10 years we realized is not just\nimportant for the health of our gut but\nalso for our immune system and for the\nproduction of neurotransmitters and\nneuromodulators things like dopamine and\nserotonin in other words gut health is\ncritical for for proper brain\nfunctioning now of course I strive to\nconsume healthy Whole Foods for the\nmajority of my nutritional intake every\nsingle day but there are a number of\nthings in ag1 including specific\nmicronutrients that are hard to get from\nWhole Foods or at least in sufficient\nquantities so ag1 allows me to get the\nvitamins and minerals that I need\nprobiotics prebiotics the adaptogens and\ncritical micronutrients so anytime\nsomebody asks me if they were to take\nJust One supplement what that supplement\nshould be I tell them ag1 because ag1\nsupport so many different systems within\nthe body that are involved in mental\nhealth physical health and performance\nto try ag1 go to drink a1.com huberman\nand you'll get a year supply of vitamin\nD3 K2 and five free travel packs of ag1\nagain that's drink a1.com\nhuberman Orient me again the question\nwas yeah so the question is have you\ndone or is it possible to get people to\nthink that you're holding up a piece of\npaper that says now I forget the numbers\nmy working memory wasn't engaged enough\nto do it uh whatever um 348 that's not\nwhat I said earlier when in fact they\nare looking at a piece of paper that\nsays something different is that is that\nsomething that can be done absolutely\nabsolutely there's a there's actually a\npiece where you you have a piece of\npaper literally printed a piece of paper\nand you control someone's mind you say\nuh I'm going to make you see things\ndistorted you're not going to see\nreality the way everybody in this room\nincling me will see it starting now and\nit's literally a piece of paper that\nsays two plus\ntwo and everybody can see it the entire\naudience can see it's 2 plus two what's\nthe answer and it goes\n16 okay and let's try something easier 1\n+ one it goes\n24 and he he he's this guy is\ncognitively Smart Sharp he's not on\ndrugs it cannot answer those questions\nit's an augmentation of reality and\nthere that manifests in many forms in\nMagic the idea of seeing something that\nis in in a\nsort you know in the optical illusion\nland of what you see is not what you see\nand that's probably applicable to every\ntrick you you'll ever see what you see\nit's not what you see it's what I want\nyou to see and and I I love that and\nagain the the that Chan Canasta guy\nspoke to you about he would go it would\ntake three cards let's say ace of hearts\nKing of Clubs seven of Spades three\ncards he'll go to a coffee\nshop and say uh choose one and they say\nKing of Clubs thank you go to another\ntable and he will do it all night and\npeople what is he doing he's not doing\nany magic to them nothing he's just\nsurveying the audience to see how they\nthink right and this is information that\nwe collect uh over the years like\nthere's a\nsomething called um I can influence you\nlet's say to take a specific card but it\nhas to be done in such way that it feels\nlike it was a free choice it was not a\nfree choice and the difference between a\ngood or a great magician and a decent\nmagician or an okay magician is that one\nmakes you feel like I chose this card\nthere is no way you made me pick this\ncard there is no\nway and that's a sort of augmentation\nit's you feel like you have control and\nyet you don't and you feel it with\nconviction you could swear are you sure\nthat's the one so there's a famous\nfamous um thing that he he used to do he\nwould say I can make people change their\nmind or\nnot and he says it up front he says I'm\nyou're going to choose a card okay any\ncard you like I'll go to the audience\nyou point to any person you want they'll\nchoose another card whatever they choose\nwill be the card you're thinking\nof and then I'll give them 10 seconds to\nchange their mind and if they do it will\nstill be correct they can change their\nmind as many times as they want and I\ndon't care once they say that's it\nthat's the card that will be the card\nyou're thinking\nof how can that be so the truth is and\nI'll reveal a little bit about\nthat there is no trickery here as far as\nyou know slide of hand or anything like\nthat he literally was a master\nat making people either want to stick to\na\ndecision or change it he would basically\nmanipulate their insecurity their ego\nsomething about them to either resist\nchanging or to really want to change and\nand and and to me and I I I I have a\nconflict a dilemma about this because my\nwhole foolest act which if want we can\ntalk about is really based on on this\nconflict or this uh problem I have um\nsometimes the the method is way more\nbeautiful than the effect\nitself so that's why I have no problem\ntelling that Chen did that Chen found a\nway with uh using specific you know\nlanguage or or gestures or whatnot\nwithout revealing too much to make\nsomebody either stick to their choice or\nchange their mind he could literally\ncontrol their bias toward one or the\nother yes um does it involve touching\ntheir body in any particular way maybe\nmaybe yeah many many times in your um\nperformances and the performances of\nother mentalists and magicians they will\nsay you know I pick a number or pick a\ncard and then uh right before the trick\nis about to advance they'll say are you\nsure okay oh that's a big one and\nthey'll say yes I'm sure or no I'm going\nto switch okay um and based on what you\ntold us already um it's clear that the\nskilled Mentalist or magician can work\nwith either scenario is maybe it's a bit\nof a it's the improvisation um but what\nI want to know is when you look at\nsomebody's physical body how they sit\ntheir shape um and other features maybe\nhow they dress how they stand maybe\nsomething about their eyes or their face\ncan you make better predictions as to\nwhat sorts of numbers they'll pick\nwhether or not they're going to stick to\ntheir choice or change their choice okay\nI think there's a lot of interest in\nthis and maybe you could um since we're\ntalking in generic terms and we're not\npresenting you with a line of people and\nasking um you which which person would\ndo what um would you be willing to share\nwhat some of those cues are so I'm um\nyou know me I wear this black shirt I\nhave other shirts but I don't uh wear\nthem on camera and um you know I comb my\nhair a certain way I sit a certain way I\nmean what sorts of predictions emerge\nfrom that or am I striking on the wrong\nvariables so it's not the big things\nthat that will reveal to me what cuz I I\ndo kind of like profile a little bit for\nthe magic purposes uh what kind of trick\nI will do with you and what I can't do\nwith you what I will do with this guy or\nthat guy right uh and it's not the shirt\nit's not how you wear your hair uh it's\nreally small things and\nuh I can talk about many people that\ninfluence me avner The Eccentric is one\nof my favorite\nperformers um his name is literally The\nEccentric it's a it's a different name\nbut he goes by alar the Ecentric and\nhe's a wonderful performer it's it's\neven hard to categorize what he does but\nhe's I'm doing the service a clown a\nmime a joggler a magician and I've never\nseen someone who's better at what we\ncall audience management there something\nwe call audience management is how do\nyou interact with people and he's able\nto\nget again I'm I'm butchering his his uh\nuh his his class to to something very\nsimple but he gets three s's from a\nperson meaning I can ask you\nnonverbally to agree to participate with\nsomething I want you to do MH and he\nwill do small things like just a little\ngesture and they he can see if they go\nfor it he sees if there's that\ndance can we is that person comp\ncomplying to something very small or is\nhe\nresisting and then easily I can go to\nthe next person so and he's a master a\nmaster at uh doing that even breathing\nif I breathe a certain way when I this\nis it blew my mind when I first learned\nfrom anner it's like when you walk into\na place so you don't see me I'm behind a\ncurtain something and I walk in and the\nfirst thing I do\nis or as opposed\nto do I take the breath in or out when I\nthe first step I take on stage and the\naudience in a weird way mimics that\nreally yeah so if I\ngo you feel you you kind of tend to\nrelax with me it now if you want a more\nuh exaggerated examp example of that if\nyou watch a movie and it's really tense\nand there's tension you will start\nfeeling tension right we're we're kind\nof like empathy is a big big part of\nwhat we do uh that's why one of the\nthings I choose to do in my show when I\nfirst start is not to start with the\nmost amazing magic to blow your mind oh\nmy God he's amazing it's it's it's more\nI I gear the first pieces\ntowards connecting with you i' rather\nsay something really endearing funny\nconnecting truthful honest before I\nstart trying to blow your mind why I\nwant to connect with you first so we are\nyou know a mother will be proud of her\nor her son's playing guitar and much\nmore forgiving if he makes a little\nmistake or something but you'll every\nlittle achievement he will make she will\nbe so proud of him because she has\nempathy she wants him to succeed she\nwants him to do well so I want you to\nadopt me I want you to to feel empathy\ntowards me I want you to be I'm rooting\nfor you this makes a lot of sense um I\ndo some Live Events and I don't think\nabout whether or not I exhale or inhale\nwhen I get out there but I definitely\ntry and get out there and just kind of\ntake it all in and relax and we have\nwhat I hope is a relaxing interesting\nconversation and you kind of work with\nthe amplitude of excitement and and I'm\nnot thinking about it in any kind of\nconscious way but this is actually a\nwonderful tool that I hope everyone will\nexport from this conversation which is\nif you ever need to do public speaking\num\nhave probably a good long exhale as you\nget out there will be great everyone\nwill relax it's also tough for me to see\nlive theater because oftentimes if it's\nnot going well for them I feel\nembarrassed for them I think people vary\nhowever in terms of their levels of\nempathic Attunement some people are very\ntuned into the emotional states of\nothers and some are not so are there\npeople in audiences assuming a\nrelatively random array of people that\nare fairly rigid like you wouldn't want\nto you wouldn't call them up to the\ntable okay um so when you select someone\nto come up in front of the crowd um are\nyou uh basing that on some level of\nempathic Attunement that they're they're\nin sync with you absolutely so it starts\nwith the first thing look you come in\ncold the audience as you said uh the\nfirst I quoting what AV here the first\nthing they do is they say I hope this\ndoesn't suck and also the performer says\nI hope it doesn't it's not going to suck\nuh the the starting point is it depends\nexpectation could vary you know if\nsomething is really highy and go oh this\nis going to be great or you've seen the\nartist and you trust them but if you\ncome in cold you don't know the person\nyou don't know if it's going to be great\nor not you just happened to be there and\nthere's a magic show let's check it out\nthere's there's tension there's almost\nlike they're auditioning you uh I I\nwonder if it's going to be worth my time\nso and I don't care if people bought a\nticket to see my off broadberry show or\nnot the first 10 15 minutes it's really\nabout telling them in so many you\nwithout words but telling them I'm here\nfor you I'm here to connect with you and\nI'm here to to create this some some\nwonderful thing that we're going to feel\ntogether I want him to feel that it's\nlike an intimacy yes and that to me by\nthe way is way more important than me\nfooling people like\nif somebody came to me after the show\nand said oh wow your magic is\nunbelievable I have no idea how you did\nit that's the lowest compliment I can\nget and thankfully and gratefully often\nI get the uh the most common one is you\nknow the magic was great\nbut you we liked you they feel connected\nto you and I love that because to me the\nmagic is important it's I want it to be\nreally deceptive I want it to be you\nknow impossible and beautiful and\nwhatnot but to me it's also a vehicle to\nconnect with people because at the end\nof the day that's what it is and that's\nthe only difference I can have because\nthere's a lot of magicians a lot of\npeople can do magic that's that you\ncan't figure out that's the lowest bar\nyou fool me good\nmagician make me feel magic higher and\nmaybe feel magic and connect it's like\nif somebody cannot even explain what I\ndid in my show and goes you had to be\nthere\nthat's something Steve Martin says all\nthe time you had to be there I can't\ntell you with words what it's like to\nsee his show you have to see it in\nperson that to me is a very high goal uh\nof of uh like I wanted to remember the\nexperience and the feeling rather than\nparticular oh the not I want\nto to care about what they experienced\nemotionally and that's how I recall the\ntrick that you did outside\nU the person who initially connected us\na just absolutely terrific um what I\ncall close contact uh card magician\nFranco pascali yes here in Los Angeles\num he has amazing uh card skills he does\num something with his card tricks I\nnoticed um I'll go to the magic assle as\noften as possible and I just watch and\nlike to take this in and I try and think\nabout the Neuroscience behind it as you\ncan tell and um when he lands a\ntrick um meaning when the person takes\nthe card and says oh my goodness you\nknow like how did you know it's like the\nthe ace switches the card whatever it is\nFranco also acts surprised he joins you\nas an audience member momentarily he\ngoes oh and then and then he goes back\nto being the the the magician and I find\nthat especially important for people to\nunderstand because you do the same and I\nalways say having studied the lectures\nof many many spectacular scientists and\nlecturers that the best lecturers in the\nclassroom obviously are teaching the\nmaterial from a place of deep\nunderstanding of the material one would\nhope right um so they have Mastery of\nthe material in some case virtuosity\nwith the material but as they're\npresenting the material to people who\nknow nothing about\nit they themselves are showing their\nDelight in the material as if it's the\nfirst time they've ever seen it and so\nthey are both student and teacher at the\nsame time and you feel immense resonance\nwith them that's nice and it reminds me\nof the experience of seeing you do magic\nor Mentalist work sure um I'm yet to see\nyou go oh my goodness but I think it's\nthe um the sense that you're\ncollaborating in\nsomething and there's this giving over\nof self like I'm I trust aie to take me\nsomeplace with this so the resistant\npeople the people that sort of like I'm\nnot going to let him fool me right\nwhat's so amazing is that in your shows\noften times those people are the ones\nthat are the ones walking out just\nshaking their heads I know because\nbrought some of them along to your shows\ngoing there's no way there's no way and\nyet you you you got them so do the\nresistant people serve a role even if\nthey're not called up of course yeah\nwhat role do Skeptics play in convincing\nother people that something happened\nthat didn't really happen so first of\nall the transformation let's somebody's\na Believer and you you show magic and\nnice it's it's wonderful we can\ncelebrate magic together but if\nsomebody's a skeptic really skeptical\nand have had really I and I and I sense\nthat I could convert them I could\ntransform them and the audience watches\nthis transformation so we going from\nhere to here that's a a wonderful thing\nso I every now and then I will recognize\nthe person who's like and you slowly\nstart to see him melt and softens it's\nalmost like a musician at a wedding you\nknow there are the people that jump up\nand dance immediately but if you're a\nskilled musician you get that person\nthat you know their their wife is saying\ncome on let's dance and M won't move and\nthen maybe you hit a certain Motif in\nthe music and the person Taps their foot\na little bit moves their head and then\nthere are certain people that they won't\ndance at all unless their song comes up\nand then they like Dart to the dance\nfloor sounds a little bit like that and\nyou've captured them you've captured\ntheir emotion you've captured their\nwillingness you've captured their whole\nbody willingness to participate in\nsomething that a minute before they were\neither too embarrassed too stubborn or\ntoo tired to engage in so here's the\ndeal magic could be an often is\nintimidating I am basically challenging\nyour intellect I in and some people if\nthey take it the wrong way they what\nthey hear is you're telling me that\nyou're smarter than me you're telling me\nyou know things I don't know and I'm not\neven close to knowing so screw you and\nand they they will reject it\naggressively like I've\nhad thankfully it's a percent uh a time\nwhen I you know we do walk around magic\nand I go and some people as soon as they\nsee me go no no no no thanks they don't\nwant to see it and and I I to me that\nthat drove me knots like why don't they\nwant to see they don't even know what\nI'm about to offer you're going to\nviolate their sense of self trust that's\nI think the fear absolutely and and as a\nmagician or as an artist if I if I use\nthat\nbut my goal is to also educate them as I\ndo the magic that we're creating this\nsafe space where these things could\nhappen and it's clear that the I'm I'm\nusing it for your own good I I you know\nI did a whole fullest act exactly about\nknowing and not knowing so I uh I'm not\ngoing to spoil too much if people want\nto see it they can see it\num I'll tell you a backstory on this if\nyou don't mind so Tommy the three major\num Heroes of magic are Ju\nTommy wander and Chan Canasta are they\nalive still Chan is not not and uh Tommy\npast Juan is still kicking butt in\nMadrid I think I saw him at the castle\nhe's very um very um exuberant yeah okay\nhe's so he's a a hero and and\nuh I'm his student so but let's talk\nabout Tommy for SEC so Tommy for a long\ntime he he did Magic that that magicians\ndid not know how it works it's it was so\ndevious that even magicians did not know\nhow it works and at some point he\nreleased some DVDs to teach his\nmagic and the trick is is very simple\nyou borrow someone's watch it disappears\nand there's a table right next to him\nwith a little box and a ribbon and he\nliterally grabs the ribbon so he never\ntouches the Box lifts the Box gives it\nto somebody he opens it inside there's\nan alarm clock they unscrewed the alarm\nclock and inside is their watch no I\nmean yes yes but even magicians who saw\nthat they go I have no idea how it's\ndone no idea and then I remember\nwatching the explanation for the first\ntime and I was thinking that the\nmethod was by far more interesting\nintriguing\nrevealing just beautiful it made the\ntrick less like I said you should\nperform the explanation don't perform\nthe trick perform the expl and and I I I\nI I broke the rules of magic like my My\nnon- Magician friends will come over and\nsay let let me showare something and I\nshow them the trick and they go wow\nthat's amazing let me show the\nexplanation and their mind was blown are\nyou willing to share a little bit of\nwhat the explanation is or is that not\nno no okay but but I will explain a\nlittle bit so the EXP I tell what the\nexplation was that it revealed that he's\nan engineer that he can build props that\nare like\ningenious uh in some again I'm going\naround it but at some point the person\nwho opens the Box is's doing part of the\ntrick and he doesn't know it he's he's\ncreating the trick but he doesn't know\nhe's contributing something to it um and\nit's just beautiful metaphorically\nsymbolically it's on so it hits so many\nlevels at least and that planted a SE in\nmy mind I want to create an effect that\nthe method is prettier than the trick\nitself so I worked for 5 years to create\nan explanation a pseudo explanation to a\ntrick that was just beautiful and it was\nan opportunity to I don't have you seen\nit I don't know if youve this the one\nyou did for pen and Teller yeah I um you\ncan describe it or I can describe it I\nmean let see how I remember it um you're\nright uh I I have more interest in\nlistening than speaking um but I'll I'll\ntell you how I remember it okay um\nyou're in a very you're in front of a\nvery large audience that includes the um\nscientist slash uh show guys at pen and\nTeller who basically debunk stuff\nthey're kind of they tried to figure it\nout they try and figure stuff out um\nsome they are asked to pick someone in\nthe audience they pick a guy as I recall\nyou wore a green and white sweater wow\nyou have a good memory yeah um he stands\nup and um ask him to pick a card I think\nI forget what it is a jack of clubs\nperhaps\num let's just say for sake of example\nJack of clubs you said are you sure\nyou're now on stage mind you there are\nhundreds of people in the audience maybe\nmore and you say are you sure and he\ngoes yeah and then he goes and you say\nare you very sure and he say no I'm\ngonna switch so now you first of all you\nhave a good memory uh that perhaps\nperhaps um I've been I've been accused\nof I have a little bit of an\naudiographic memory for certain things\nbut not a visual uh memory that's\nperfect they're sort of adjacent we\ncould talk about that sometime at\nsomething helps you if you need to learn\nneuron Anatomy that's about it can be\ncultivated okay so then he switches the\ncard let's just call it um uh I don't\nknow Jack of uh Spades right okay um or\nKing King of Spades say let's say Jack\nof Spades and\nthen next to you on the table up on the\nstage is a a table a round table um with\na plexiglass Box Cigar Box Cigar Box\nit's clear no no not yet no not yet\nlater later okay at first it's just a\nwooden cigar wooden box that's right and\na mug a white mug not unlike the mug I\nhave here except white you take a sip\nfrom that mug and then at some point\nduring this exchange and then you um\nopen the box yes and you pull from the\nbox of course the card that he selected\nand everyone say goes oh my goodness how\ncould that possibly be because obviously\nanyone could have been selected in the\naudience he switched his choice Etc um\nbut then you reveal how the trick is\ndone or at least seemingly reveal it\nwhich is that beneath the Box there's\nsome uh a bunch of different decks of\ncards on 52 on a Turn Style So within\neach one a um right and I I missed a\npiece of it you you pull out the whole\ndeck and only one card is turned over\nand all the other cards are blank all\nthe other cards are blank right so\nthere's more to it so then it turns out\nthat there are 52 different decks\nunderneath the table and it's on a Turn\nStyle so you can actually dial it and\nlet's let's keep the ending surprise\nright so there's there's a surprise\nending to it right so so then it at\nleast seemingly makes sense as to how AI\ndid this he has a all the different\noption possible options available to him\nphysically but the audience doesn't\nrealize that also that the mug by the\nway engages a magnet system that allows\nhim to dial the the deck of cards to the\ncorrect one that allows him to match the\nchoice so it truly could be any card in\nthe deck good meaning it's all\nthe so the straightforward explanation\nis it's all physical trickery by way of\nprops correct so here's the deal uh what\nI tried to achieve with this piece is\nfirst to make people feel magic so the\ntrick it's a good trick you know name\nany card the the card he named was\nreversed and then it was the only blue\ncard in the deck and then all the other\ncards were blank so it's clearly the\nonly card he could have named and he did\nswitch is uh which is amazing detail\nthat you remembered he did switch from\nthe King of Clubs to the King of Spades\nsomething like that yeah\nnow so people felt what it's like to see\na good car trik right and then I wanted\nher to feel what it's like to\nknow and the lesson here is you know you\ncould satisfy your curiosity oh that's\nhow it's done and you can go on with\nyour life and that's it and and that's\nwhat happens to a magician when you\nfirst learn the secrets to\nyou know something that fooled you\nthere's\ndisappointment I remember the first shg\nthat was revealed to me um it was a\nlittle red handkerchief stuffed into the\nhand\ngone and I'm like what do it again and\nhe did it\nagain he did 10 times in a row I\ncouldn't and then he explain to me how\nit's done and the secret was so simple\nand stupid\nno didn't that you share with us no no\nno but I gotta tell you it was primitive\nit was simple and in the moment he\nrevealed the gimmick that caused the\nanchor Chief to\ndisappear I could not see the trick\nagain every time he do it's this yeah\nit's like falling out of\nlove something like yeah that's really I\nmean a previous guest on the podcast\nCarl di Roth one of the best\nbioengineers nor scientist and\npsychiatrist in the world um went on Lex\nFriedman podcast and they were talking\nabout love and Carl said something\ninteresting that's very relevant here he\nsaid um he's a colleag you mine at\nStanford very poetic guy um he said you\nknow love between two people romantic\nlove that is is one of the few things in\nlife that we collaborate with someone to\nstory something into the future H you\nknow this is different than the love of\na child or a sibling or a parent or a\npet Etc or a friend right that you\nyou're creating a story that's based on\nreal experience of past and present but\nthere's this storying forward of love\nthat's great and um and falling out of\nlove involves of course the ending of\nthe story moving forward but also a in\nsome cases sadly a revision of the\nevents of the past I like I it's great\nit's it's very close it's very close to\nto the feeling you have as a magician\nthe first time you a tri get exposed\nright it disappoints you\nbecause you have a desire for it to be\nreal the the desire of a young magician\nis when I see something like that is\nthat it's a supernatural power and the F\nthe first thing you you you understand\nis that it's not Supernatural that it's\nquite simple and primitive\nand it fooled you because of all the\npsychology and and the desire like\neverything we spoke about my desire to\nbe to see magic uh the the the fact of\nthe idea of misdirection which we can\ntalk about at\nlength misdirection\nmeans I provide something very\ninteresting for you to\nfollow and you will follow that path\nbecause it's the most interesting at the\nmoment to\nfollow and in the\nbackground in the sh shadiness of of\nLife some dirty stuff happen but you\ndon't pay attention because I don't\nfeature it it's not important and I make\nyou render it is not\nimportant so it does that right and it's\ndisappointment but there's good news if\nyou keep up with magic and you start to\nunderstand that to do a trick the\nsecret the the the actual how you did it\nis 1% of the the whole procedure and\nthere's much more to doing that trick\neffectively which is\nstorytelling\nconnecting\nuh doing it in such way that somebody\ncares about it and and that is a\nlifetime of of uh pondering and\ncontemplation\nso you\nhave maybe you'll find analogy with love\nagain I don't know there's also this\ntime when you start appreciating it\nagain appreciate the secret again\nbecause you understand the Nuance you\nunderstand the complexity of this simple\nthing and that that's what happened to\nme so I in some magic which is the\nexception is the table that we spoke\nabout that I didn't fool us or Tommy W's\ntable where the effect is so so so\nmagnificent that you do appreciate it\nimmediately but those are rare most\nmagic is simple dirty and to the point\nbut it\nachieves uh something that looks very\ncomplex perhaps now would be the\nappropriate time for you to reveal the\nthe the non reveal of the explanation of\nthe trick because one of the amazing\nthings about the trick that you did with\nselecting the card that the gentleman in\nthe audience of pen and Teller had\nmentally and verbally selected is that\nat the very end after everyone believes\nthey Now understand how the trick is\ndone the Turn Style table the magnet the\nthe coffee mug you proceed to strip away\nthe the curtain the curtain around the\ntable and pull out a piece of paper not\n52 decks of cards it's a picture or 52\nit's a picture which means that the\nexplanation that they got while entirely\nplausible if that's actually what had\nhappened is not at all what had happened\nin other words you pop out at the end\nthat they don't actually know how it's\ndone you know how it's done and I'm not\neven going to bother to ask you um how\nit's done because you're not going to\nreveal it in other words people were\nmisdirected into thinking they\nunderstood the trick and therefore kind\nof there's a bit of a let down it's\ninteresting but it's just mechanics\nmagnets and and then you reveal that uh\ntheir understanding is actually not real\nyes and and the reason I wanted to go\nthere it's so I wanted them to feel\nmagic then to feel what it's like to\nknow something and the the fact that\nit's\nirreversible you can't unknow a trick\nonce you know how it's done and then I\nwhat I said look I made a choice I chose\nto learn the secrets to Magic and I'm\npaying a price for it I cannot see magic\nthe way you can I cannot enjoy the way\nmy audience can and in a weird way I'm\nexperienced magic only through their\neyes when I see somebody goes wow\nthrough you I can experience it but\nthat's it I\ncannot firsthand experience magic the\nway you can\nso I said I'm not here to make that\nchoice for you so let me bring you back\nto safety to the place you were at it's\na place I envy to mystery and then I\nrevealed that the whole explanation was\nBogus the whole thing was just another\nlie and I'm establishing another thing\nthat as a magician I have a license to\nlie to you and it's okay cuz that's my\njob and therefore it makes it honest and\nwe're collaborating in that to some\nextent because when people go to a magic\nshow they understand that another former\nguest on the podcast Rick Rubin who\nneeds no introduction um but by the way\nhe's a big fan of magic um has said to\nme before um that there are only two\nthings in life that are absolutely true\none is nature right they're real truths\nthey're real laws and Rules of Nature\nyeah and the other is uh for him uh\nprofessional wrestling because uh Rick\nloves professional wrestling he's a\nlifetime member of the aw and the WWE\nI've gone to see wrestling with him and\nthe reason he believes it's one of the\nfew things that's real is that everyone\nknows it's not real and so everyone\nagrees to collaborate in this story this\ntheater of these guys hate each other\nthis woman and this woman are now\nfriends they're collaborators and so\nunlike everything else which is\ncompletely made up and you're not sure\nwhat's real and what's uh fake with\nprofessional wrestling and with nature\nit's a real truth I would add to that\nmagic because when we go to see magic we\nwant to be\nastonished most people do we want our\nperceptions to be uh violated right what\nwe believe is there isn't there Etc um\nand yet we are doing this consensually\nwe we're doing this and so we're\nagreeing like let's collaborate in in a\nin a lie that there's this thing called\nMagic um I guess and that's a pretty ill\ndefined term in its own right where you\nknow this idea that physical objects can\nbe made to disappear violate the rules\nof nature of physics um and unless\nyou're of a certain ilk out there in the\nworld that simply is not the case the\nlaws of nature hold so maybe there's\nanother analogy there because we know\nthat professional wrestlers are faking\nit and we know a magician fakes it too\nhe fakes Supernatural Powers right\nthey're doing real things in wrestling\nbut they're not actually trying to harm\none another correct right they're\ncollaborating\nbut it's almost a cargraph fight right\nyes I think there's some my\nunderstanding is based on discussions\nwith Rick and professional wrestlers um\nthat Rick has introduced me to is that\nthere's some room for improvisation and\noccasionally people will hurt one\nanother um accidentally sometimes there\nare real conflicts that are created yeah\njust like in the theater people will\nhave relationships off stage Etc and it\ncreates conflict on stage and that's the\nwhere the theater of life meets the\ntheater of the stage and vice versa so I\nwould would add to that maybe maybe I'm\nwrong um that you do a magic show and\nyou know an educated person a smart\nperson who knows that what I do is\ntrickery\nConjuring uh but every now and then they\nmight ask I wonder if that was real that\nlittle part he just did maybe that was\nreal so there's there's a moment I think\nin Magic where even the smartest guy who\nknows I do tricks I go yeah this is all\ntricks but maybe what he just did now\nmaybe that was real like make it when\nyou say real you mean violates the rules\nof physics so um taking a card holding\nit up clenching your fist making it\ndisappear I'm giving simple kind of\nsilly mind reading or or is they say\nmaybe he's able to do those things\npsychologically or whatnot right and\nmaybe that happens also in wrestling\nthey say yeah it's fake but I think that\nmoment was real so there's an inkling or\nmoment where because I think you to\ncreate this\ndrama and to me that that existed magic\nis he real is he fake uh did I figure it\nout or did I not figure it out am I Clos\nor am I not there's constant conflict in\na magic show that you go in and out of\nand I wonder if that happens in resting\nas well where you you know it's fake but\nmaybe there's something that was real or\nthis happened and that was not planned\nso I think that\nthis just the thinking the fact that you\ninvested into thinking what is is real\nand what is not is intriguing I'd like\nto just take a quick break and\nacknowledge one of our sponsors insid\ntracker inside tracker is a personalized\nnutrition platform that

a much larger\ntheme here that we're veering toward and\nI'm getting excited because this has to\ndo with how the brain works and it and\nthere examples in different domains but\nto come to mind now Rick and I sometimes\nhang out um here in Los Angeles and that\nthere's a place where we do sauna and\ncold and it looks out on the ocean and\num Rick once turned to me and said um\nyou know isn't it interesting you know\nwe know that there're all these animals\nunder the water dolphins and whales and\nall this stuff sharks and uh but when we\nsee a\ndolphin or a group of dolphins or we see\na whale breach it's like people are\njust delighted now they're beautiful\nanimals but often times it's just a tail\nslapping the top and I think and he said\nI wonder if it's because it reminds us\nof how much is going on there underneath\nthe surface and and I love that because\nI think a he's right you know I've done\nsome snorkeling some scuba diving you\nsee lots of stuff and it's a it's a\nbrilliant experience to see all that and\nto be a fish of sorts and be breathing\nunderwater but there is something\nMagnificent about seeing an aquatic\nanimal breach the surface and it and it\ngoes beyond just seeing the animal it's\nlike a reminder of all these other\nthings that are likely happening that\nare outside our usual perception and so\nthat's what comes to mind there\num and then I had another example but I\nbut I can't think of it now um where oh\nit's in um Sports you know I always\nthink of there's unskilled skilled\nMastery and virtuosity and and\nvirtuosity in music like yoyo ma um or\nin sport I don't know pick up I don't\nknow Michael Jordan whatever favorite\nsport this idea that maybe they don't\neven know what they're going to do next\nthat there's some improvisation at the\nlevel of extreme Mastery where you're\ngoing to see something you've never seen\nbefore and I think that's what Delights\npeople it's not just about getting the\nball into the end zone or the ball into\nthe basket or playing a piece of music\nit's the idea of something happening for\nthe first time and maybe again as with\nthe earlier example that the person\nperforming The Athlete the musician Etc\nthe magician the mentalists they\nthemselves are delighted by what just\nhappened they didn't even realize it was\ngoing to happen and you collaborate in\nthis like wow life holds far more than I\nexperience on my daily perceptual\nkind of\nframework yeah could very well could be\nand I think your shows bring people to\nthat I I want to um return to a couple\nof ideas first of all we've been talking\nabout emotion and collaboration a lot\nsure um we've had a guest on the podcast\nDavid Spiegel he's our associate chair\nof Psychiatry at Stanford who does\nclinical hypnosis uh which it brings\npeople into a state of calm plus a very\nconstrained context where they're more\nlikely to think about certain things\nthan others how much of what you do with\nan individual group of people in your\ncraft involves hypnosis constraining the\ncontext in other words eliminating\ncertain patterns of thinking to make\nother certain patterns of thinking more\nlikely is that like a a storytelling\nlike you start telling me a story a\nhorror story or a mystery or a comedy\nstory I'm shutting down whatever you're\nnot talking about is that is that\nsomething that you do yeah so so first\nof we have theatrical hypnosis people\nthat do shows where they get they gather\nabout 20 people stage and they start\nmaking them dance like chickens right um\nI've never been full on with with these\ntype of performances for various reasons\nI just I to me that's not the best way\nfor me to engage with an audience or\nor or to manipulate them however there's\nsome there's certain things that we do\nin in in Magic that if you say certain\nthings in a certain way it will produce\na certain\nanswer and it amazes me too I like\nthere's some we call them psychological\nforces that you you\nsee uh a string of words in a certain\norder and and it will produce with with\nwith high\npercentage a yes or a no or I want this\nand that that and like would you you\nwant to pick the this deck of cards or\nthat deck of cards type leading\nthat could that could be the simplest of\nof the idea but it could it could be\neven more complex than that um and and\nit amazes me because it's almost like a\nrecipe you follow the recipe put in the\noven boom okay you know but there's in\nMagic when I se certain certain things\nthere's a moment when I I'm waiting for\nyou to say something and I I I don't\nknow if you're going to follow what I\njust did and then I hear it and I go\nthere's a joy it's like yes it work and\nthis reveals something fundamental about\nthe brain for instance I could imagine\nif I have two mugs in front of me for\nthose listening if I hover my finger on\none of them longer than others and I say\nwould you like to drink from this mug\nand keep it there for 10 seconds or this\none and I just tap the other one briefly\ndo you think you bias the probability of\nwhich one somebody will pick absolutely\nbecause and that's what that's a great\nexample ER I could it depends on my\ncharacter first I need to know who I'm\ndoing it to are you the Challenger are\nyou the guy who's going to go with\nanything okay let's say it's the guy who\ngo with anything think there's a\nlikelihood he will go with the one you\ntouch longer but if it's the Challenger\nhe will say oh I I see what's Happening\nHere Andrew is trying to make me take\nthis one and therefore I'm going to take\nthat one so and that's that's the\nsimplest idea of of of challenges and I\ncould challenge you again and say with\ndoubt and then I could say are you sure\nyou want the one that I tapped just\nbriefly I'm not telling you it that way\nbut I'd say are you sure and if you say\nyes you're challenging me again and now\nI'm certain you're a challenger so\nyou're collecting data basically you're\ncollecting data and and because I've\ndone it thousands of times I do the\nexact same spell the same you know order\nof events and I and I and I get to to\ntry it and sometimes I say okay let's\nphrase it differently you know there's\nroutines where I do when I I need\nsomeone to say a certain\nsomething and and I don't just rely on\nthe psychological Force I I have other\nTools in my arsenal of of of\ntools and but it surprises me the am the\nthe percentage this the the\nrate uh and that's Chan did a lot he\nunderstood the idea that if people feel\nchallenged they do this if they feel\nlike maybe that you're desperate for\nthem to change they'll act a different\nway and again I'm tip toing again\nbecause I don't want to demystify Magic\nhere I I'm trying to say that there's a\nreal way for and and you know Daniel\nconman and Emma tersi they talk about it\nin in their work you know they're\nthinking fast and slow for example which\nwhich to us is a magic book how people\nmake decisions and he they they often\nsay if you you phrase a question one way\nversus another way and even though the\nsame thing is at stake it's the same\nequation if you phrase it this way\nthey'll prefer that if you phrase it\nthat way they prefer the other one it\nand it makes no sense because that's the\nbottom line is like which one do you\nwant well I think the brain runs\nalgorithms and um some of it's\nhistorical in how we are raised I give\nan example A friend of mine has twins\nand I said uh how's it going with the\ntwins um describe their personalities\nand how they differ and he said that one\nof his twin daughters um no matter what\nyou tell her she says no she challenges\nyou but not as a way to disengage engage\nas a way to engage nice interesting yeah\ninteresting um\nand the other one is very willing to\nengage in things doesn't challenge but\nengages through you know active\ncollaboration um when we had Chris Voss\na former FBI negotiator here on the\npodcast he said one way to get\ninformation from people on in these uh\nscenarios he used to do before is\ninstead of asking them a question you\ngive a\nhypothesis you keep your hair really you\nknow nice you got great hair you must um\nyou must like spend a lot of money on\nclothes now people will respond he tells\nme by either agreeing yes or no I don't\nreally spend a lot of money you just got\ninformation but you're not asking do you\nspend a lot of money on clothes you\nbasically State a hypothesis yes and\nthen they are either going to accept or\nrefute your hypothesis and people almost\nreflexively respond to hypothesis about\nthem from others by wanting to defend\nthe truth\nand that's a way that FBI negotiators\nand others get information rather than\nask questions give them hypothesis and\npeople will defend their truth to the\npoint of giving up information they\nwouldn't otherwise yeah and and if you\nwant to I know you're here to for me to\nreveal my tricks so I'll reveal\nsomething hypnosis they do this quite a\nbit and it's a beautiful strategy of of\nof doing it they'll make a few\nstatements and they're simple statements\nthey're accurate they you can argue with\nthose statements they they ring true and\nyou believe them and then maybe the last\nthing they're going to say is not quite\ntrue but because of you average the\ninformation and you go okay it's he's\nspeaking the truth now he's telling us\nthe truth but in between those\nstatements there's some inaccuracies\nthere that are starting to manipulate\nyou but they're half truth like it's\nit's like for example I say the this\nthis is a round Table Right and uh and\nyou feel you can feel the light right\neven if you close your eyes you could\nfeel the light and you can even feel\nthat even if you didn't know that this\nis a bigger light than this one because\nof the heat now this might be a false\nstatement but it makes sense and you can\nstart to feel heat on one side and you\nstart to go yeah is is it's logical it\nit's very sensical therefore it's it's\ntrue but it's a half truth maybe if we\nmeasure that this is a stronger life who\nknows but and I and I say you know and\nyou feel there's a bit of a hum\nhere and the more you focus on it and\nit's get and it's getting louder now\nbecause you're paying attention to it\nit's getting louder it's not getting\nlouder you know actually you're guiding\nperception but I'm guide exactly I'm I'm\nI'm directing your attention to the\nthings I want you\nto you heard the plane mhm it's an\nillusion no it's a real plane so you\nknow but this is something that\nhypnotists do very well you know guiding\nyou you know going to NLP and all that\nit's all related the idea of like um\nsounding like they're telling you things\nthat should make sense and they're\naccurate but they're not they're sort of\naccurate and it becomes more and more\nridiculous until they tell you dance\nlike a chicken and then you Dan like a\nchicken yeah it's so interesting because\num perception obviously is governed by\nthe brain at least in part brain and\nbody but nervous system and we have\nessentially two attentional spotlights\nmeaning we can pay attention to two\nthings at the same time but probably not\nfive and we can merge those spotlights\nand we can make them more intense so to\nspeak or we can dim them and make them\nmore diffuse you know there's a bunch of\nthings that we can do with attentional\nspotlighting what you're talking about\nhere is attentional spotlighting\nbringing people's perception to real\nthings that are happening but\nheightening one's perception of those so\ngetting more granularity on what's\nHappening like right now I'm in contact\nwith physical contact with a pen in my\nhand but I wasn't thinking about how it\nfeels but if I put all of my perception\nthere close my eyes and really think\nabout it the whole nature of the\nperception changes corre the physical\nobject hasn't changed nothing else in\nthe room has changed but that driving of\nattentional spotlighting and\nintensity is essentially what governs\nour whole reality I think of everything\nwe're talking about here and I can't\nhelp but think about like\nmedia social media politics you know\nvery like third rail issues uh things or\ntop very third rail topics right and yet\nthis is essentially what we do the brain\npeople want um a short-hand way of\nnavigating a very complex world and\nmedia marketing Etc is in large part\ndesigned to capture people's attention\nand then funnel it towards some specific\nendpoint vote this way by this way don't\nvote that way or don't vote that way and\nand it's uh I feel\nlike given our discussion you one has to\nwonder to what extent we we are all\nliving in that what I guess people call\nit a simulation it's not a simulation\nit's a we are all being biased by these\nexternal forces do you see examples of\nquote unquote magic and Mentalist work\nat the level of media at the level of\npolitics without talking about sides or\ncenters you know of course first of all\nI feel like social media has changed the\nway audience behaves in the theater tell\nme more about that so first of all I\nknow now you have Tik Tok and Instagram\nand and it's really short clips of\ninformation and people go through them\nreally quickly so there stimulation they\nneed to be stimulated way more often\nthan they used to so I can't do a\nroutine now that really drags with long\nmonologs and it's slow the speed\nchanged and and the fact that you know\nand I and I I think about this a lot I\nmean there's a blackout when when I did\nInner Circle there's a blackout before I\nappear so I I come in and I I can still\nsee people to the very last minute on\ntheir phones and I'm like wow it's the\ngoing from one stimulation to a real\nstimulation with almost no gaph there's\nnot even a second a buffer between this\nstimulation to what\nI'm and and it always bothers me cuz I\nwant to to clean their pallet I want to\nreset their pallet and it bothers me\nthat they're on a phone yeah it's like\num going from the the Super Bowl to the\nNBA championships or from the ballet to\na rock concert it's like um yeah I\nactually have a theory which is that for\nthose that are willing to introduce gaps\nin\nstimulation sleep we'll talk more about\nsleep um rest walks where we're not\nlooking at our phones or just kind of um\nnot necessarily bored but that those\ngaps we know we know with certainty are\nwhen the brain both processes\ninformation stabilizes information that\nwe've learned and comes up with new\nideas there it's it's almost like\nnowadays if you want to get really good\nat some craft just introduce more gaps\nin between intense focus and learning\naround that thing and exposure to that\nthing I I I couldn't be more certain\nabout this it's it's true and again Juan\nagain Tamar talks\nabout the the the the power of pauses\nand and one of the things we try to do\nis that people will\nembed um a memory so it's not just that\nyou\nencode the information and you want them\nto store it you want to start long term\nand to be able to recall what they've\nseen now if you move from one action to\nthe other it's just not going to work so\nthere's a thing that Juan does where\nhe's like he's holding a card and he\nsays can you see the reflection in my\nglasses and every's like what is he\ndoing look do you see reflection and and\nmeanwhile he's holding a pling card to\npoint to towards the glasses and then at\nsome point he places the card on the\ntable and accidentally en knocks a a\nglass filled with water everywhere and\npeople p like they start cleaning it and\nand it's\nlike it's inter a huge Interruption to\nwhat just happened and then he says uh\ndoes anybody know what card this\nis and most of the times nobody knows he\ngoes you never saw this card and they go\nno you never showed it to us oh I never\nshowed it to you and there was one event\nwhere he did where he replayed the video\nto them says look I'm holding it for 15\nseconds in front of you in a very\nawkward way\nand they don't remember it because\nsomething dramatic happened immediately\nafter no there's no moment for them to\nisolate the two events and the other\nevent was way more uh impactful and\ntherefore more memorable that it erased\nthe small memory the small event the the\nthere's a big event and a smaller event\nand that took over that's why maybe I\ndon't people crash into they have an\naccident you know whatever they don't\nremember the 10 or 5 seconds before it\nkind of erases it m\nso we often when we do magic we do want\nto give him a moment to really relax and\nto digest what they've just seen so they\ncan store it very well if it's something\nyou want them to store but if it's\nsomething you want them to prefer to\nforget than creating a dramatic moment\nadjacent to it and with no Gap it's the\nway to go yes this is we clut it we clut\ntheir mind with information when we\ndon't want to store it we will slow down\nand feature it and give it enough time\nto breathe and live when we want them to\nrecord it so the speed the emphasis the\npauses all of those things are\nmanipulating how they remember things\ncan I share with you a little bit of\nNeuroscience please bit knowledge this\nis relevant both to what you just said\nand to learning of any kind there's a\nphenomenon called Gap effects which are\nvery well demonstrated in neuroscience\nand psychology of learning um but but\nbefore I explain those it's really\nimportant to know that when we learn\nwe're exposed to something and then the\nactual rewiring of Connections in the\nbrain occurs typically during sleep or\nrest periods away from the learning\nthere's the stimulus just like exercise\nyou don't get better heart you know V2\nMax and muscle strength Etc during the\nexercise there's an adaptation that\noccurs later and with uh learning of\ncognitive material or information of any\nkind even if it's very emotionally\nimpactful experience or information the\nrewiring of connections occurs later\ntypically in sleep or sometime later now\nduring sleep the replay of the memory\noccurs but at a rate about 20 or 30\ntimes faster and for some reason Nobody\nKnows Why in Reverse okay so a string of\nnumbers 1 2 3 4 5 six seven in sleep is\nplayed 30 times faster and SE 7654321\nnobody's NOS why this is the way the\nbrain encodes information about space\nabout information\nuh of any kind now Gap effects are the\nvery well demonstrated effect of let's\nsay you're teaching me how to um shuffle\ncards or a sequence of numbers or scales\non a piano I'm practicing I'm practicing\nI'm practicing but somebody figured out\nthat if every once in a while there's a\ngap introduced where I cannot perform\nthe rehearsal I do nothing the brain\ndoes the same thing the hippocampus a\ncenter in the brain required for memory\nand encoding of new memories plays that\nsame sequence at 20 to 30 times faster\nin\nReverse so this way so what this means\nis that when we introduce gaps the brain\nis still processing the information but\nmuch faster and the introduction of the\nGap somehow allows whatever we just\nlearned to be\nencoded far more than if we don't\nintroduce a gap which is exactly what\nyou just said but with a bunch of nerdy\nNeuroscience speak to it but this has\nbeen shown for music for math for\nconceptual knowledge Etc and what it\nsays to me is that if we want to learn\nthings controlling the Cadence and the\num the availability of gaps and the\nadjacency like how densely cluttered or\nspaced out things are is key and um I'll\njust share briefly and forgive me\nbecause I'm going long here but um the\nway I remember the video of you with pen\nand Teller and the green and white\nsweater and a few other you took a nap\nright after no what I do is I watch\nsomething or read something and I\nsometimes highlight and take notes but\nthen what I do is I close my eyes\nsometimes I take a walk and I just think\nabout what I just saw now I have a\nproblem and I was recently referred to\nas neuroatypical which I'm starting to\nwonder if that's true but you know uh\nI'll get assessed and we'll see um that\noftentimes irrelevant details are what\nget encoded to memory as opposed to the\ncore feature but um we'll see um I I\nlike to think the core the core\ncomponents are what I remember um but\noften details that seem irrelevant get\nencoded like I can remember details of\nthings that are kind of maybe trivial um\nto most so I these Gap effects are a a\nreal neurobiological phenomenon there's\nno question about it and I suppose I\nshould pause to let that sink in I know\nand people should take a nap right after\nthis go sleep and think about this\nconversation I think it's so interesting\nbecause so that explains something about\nencoding of information but the causing\npeople to forget something is equally\nimportant so often times when you do\ntricks or when other magicians and\nmentalists do tricks I notice that\nyou'll get people to count with you okay\nlet's all right let's just count the\ncards count them with me it'll be one\ntwo three is there something about the\ncounting itself or the Cadence of the\ncounting that is that is um valuable yes\nuh we we try to create tension you know\nit's a drum roll think of it as a drum\nroll that all the way to the punchline\num and you you're trying to create this\ntension oh my oh my God oh my God and\nthen it happens right and on the\nrelaxation the moment right after that\nwhen you relax that's the moment to do\nthe things you don't want them to encode\nthe those are the the most vulnerable so\nin other words when you go to a magic\nshow Do Not Laugh do not relax remain\ntense and you'll be good but the moment\nyou\nrelax you're off guard you're not\nscrutinizing you're relaxing uh um so we\nwe do play a lot and slini was a master\nof that the idea of tension and\nrelaxation so those are just one of the\ntools that we would use in order to do\nwhat we need to do at the right spot\nlook here here's an interesting\nexample you've heard the term\nmisdirection I think every person in the\nworld have heard and understands the\nidea of misdirection a magician is\nmisdirecting you and yet that\ninformation does not help you in the\nreal\nworld right you know the concept you\nknow it exists you know a magician will\nmake you look at the wrong place at the\nwrong time and you would or maybe the\nright place at the right time and you\nwould still\nfollow in other words knowing the\nprinciple knowing that he's doing\nit it's still effective and that is\namazing so to me that is\nuh the reason I don't TR to enrich\npeople people's knowledge about magic\nand to give a little bit of information\nof of behind a curtain the things that\nmagicians say oh we're going to you know\nthere's a beautiful saying that I just\nlove and I don't know who who's uh\nresponsible for this beautiful quote but\nI love it I quote it all the time uh\npeople think that magicians are guarding\nthe secrets from the audience but it's\nthe other way around we are guarding the\na audience from the\nsecrets so um because we know that once\nyou know how it's done you won't enjoy\nit but I believe also that there's a\nlevel of\nknowledge that you can know about magic\nthat next time you see magician you\nwould enjoy it more because you\nunderstand that to\ndo one car trick could take months and\nmonths of work and we we think about\nevery word in every move and how we\ninteract and how we you know hook you\ninto wanting to be fold create the\ndesire for you to see magic and it's\nsuch an intricate process so maybe you\nknow revealing revealing a little bit\nabout magic is not a bad thing so you\nunderstand the complexity of this art\nwhich unfortunately is invisible art cuz\na Pianist sure you can see how skillful\nI am but if you come to me after show oh\nyou're so fast with your hands that's an\ninsult I want you to say but you never\ntouched\nanything so it's it's it's a bit of a a\nconflict here it's like uh the show that\nI saw that you did in New York right off\nWashington Square Park um uh you didn't\ntouch any of the cards or materials the\naudience did it all for you which are\nthe inner circle you had a people\nactually maneuvering the cards and doing\nthings they weren't collaborating with\nyou in fact it made it far less like\nthat you ought to be able to do what you\nwere doing um which is which is\nremarkable I think that um you know as\nyou're describing this I I can't help\nbut feel that\nthe understanding of mechanism or how\nit's done just a little bit is is a\nlittle bit of what I've tried to do with\nthe podcast where I think people\nobviously want to know what to do for\ntheir health but if they understand a\nlittle bit of the mechanism behind it\nmaybe a lot of the mechanism in some\ncases then I think it enriches their\nunderstanding and gives them\nflexibility when things are perhaps not\nyou know optimal sort of like someone\nlearning a recipe uh versus\nunderstanding why you add a little bit\nof baking soda so that when there isn't\nany baking soda maybe there's an\nalternative or you make an adjustment\nsomeplace else right that's a what a\nreal cook can do um as opposed to\nsomebody just following a recipe I think\nthat with magic this takes us back to\nthe first question I think with magic um\nit's so exciting to me that the magician\nThe Mentalist themselves might not get\nit right like if I know you're going to\nget it right it's exciting because for\nif I bring someone else along that's\nnever seen it before but what I want to\nknow is that you know the trapeze artist\ncould fall exactly I don't want them to\nfall but that the idea that they could\nfall is what makes it really excited\nabsolutely and we fake it a lot there's\na lot of times where I will\nintentionally create a scenario where it\nseems like it's not going right right\nyou know I'm in trouble and I need to\nget out of it and you go he's okay he\nhe's good good but this one no and then\nthen you realize it was a part of the\nillusion and this is like even even the\ntrouble was an illusion don't trust\nanything sorry I didn't mean to\ninterrupt there you paused for me to\nremember and I inter want to digest it\nright this is like this is built into\nevery script of every romantic comedy\nand every action movie like everything's\nyou know there's a challenge then\nthere's moving forward and then things\nare about to go well and then oh my\ngoodness they're on the wrong trains\nit's going to be and then that's the\ntension build and then there's\nresolution of some sort and then\nsometimes there's a Twist at the end\nwhere the resolution isn't there and\nthat's how you get a SQL right it's it's\nkind of the same yes thing I I wonder um\nand I hope that someday Neuroscience\nwill understand the kind of what the\ncore algorithms in the brain are for a\nstory a story that involves a question\nand a hypothesis some\ncharacters and some trajectory a\npotential you know error and then some\nresolution and then maybe it opens up\nthe possible possibility of mystery\nagain because as you describe a magic\ntrick or a mentalist act it seems to\nfollow that sequence you introduce the\npeople the cards the props Etc and then\nthere's a story and here's what's\ninteresting I see this in comedy also\none of the things that's exciting is\nwhen we think we know what's going to\nhappen next and it's it's either that we\nare very surprised there's a violation\nof the expectation but even more\ninteresting sometimes is when we're like\nno no no no no this where we think that\nsomething's going to happen and you're\nactually taking us towards that\nunbelievable possibility this is\nsomething I find amazing that you know\nsometimes even when we expect something\nor especially when we expect something\nif it's an outrageous outcome there's no\nway that's when we are most excited CU\nwe're involved we're part of the drama\nso I love what you said about the idea\nof a recipe right following verbatim in\na passive way I don't know how it works\nbut eventually I think this would lead\nme to a\ncake somehow as opposed to understand\nwhat what the chemistry is and why this\nhappens and why this and that I think\nthat um you become more invested and you\nare part of the act so it's it's almost\nlike I I am obsessed you know also with\npainting something that I I I I just do\noften and I remember I can easily recall\nthe experience I had be when I went to a\nmuseum and watched some art before I\npainted and the way I view it\ntoday as a painter as someone who's\ntouched pigments mixed them put them on\na on on a canvas or paper and all of a\nsudden I look at it a little\ndifferently and I think it changes the\ninteraction\nthat I have with the painting because I\nunderstand the language I understand the\nstruggle I understand the challenge\nunderstand all of that and it's the same\nwith anything like when you read one of\nmy favorite reads of all time and I to\nthis date is ven Go's uh\nletters I remember you know I saw ven go\nbefore I saw it\nafter and the story and that's that's\nwhy I think we can talk about AI for a\nsecond but the story of of the letters\nwith the paintings make them complete\ndifferent images when I see now the\nsunflowers or the chairs or the\nLandscapes and I have some context to go\nby uh they become a a part of a much\nbigger story and to me that it enhances\nthe um the experience so a few friend\nyou know me and a couple of my friends\nuh went to a museum the met and there\nwas a beautiful wooden\nsphere half opened like that and the\ndetail was like you need a microscope to\nsee and to appreciate the delicate\ncarving of the wood and we all looked at\nit in awe it was like it's\namazing and I said to them you know you\nlook at it and you you see the year it's\nfrom the 1800s and you go wow the\ntechnology they had in 1800s to do that\nand the patience and the time all of it\nis part of the the artwork but if I told\nyou I we fold you um this was 3D printed\n20 minutes ago it took about five\nminutes and it's we can make a million\nof them right now it's the exact same\nobject it looks as\nimpressive but the story is different\nand I think that is Again part of the\nexperience we have a recipe when you\nunderstand it the experience you have is\ndifferent so I I I do I do believe that\nknowledge\num really can enhance an experience\nchange it completely so that's something\nI I'm being on uh stories seem to be the\nthe kind of bento box that arranges\ninformation best in my opinion you know\nuh for those that don't know bento box\nright like a like a box a little\ndifferent compartments and you have\ndifferent things and you know the the\nbrain can okay let's just a some some\nfirst principles ground truths um we can\nonly perceive a certain number of things\nat any one time but we're sensing tons\nof information so the brain is a\nselective filter and a prediction\nmachine and so and it does a bunch of\nother things to Keep Us Alive but that's\nbasically it um all my Neuroscience\ncolleagues are probably like wait wait\nwait but what about this okay but that's\nthat's pretty much it Keep Us Alive\npredict things and perceive certain\nthings that we can sense not others\nthings outside our sensory apparatus\nlike infrared vision and sensing you\nknow certain forms of of heat and\nelectromagnetic energy some yes some no\ndepends on what animal you are so okay\nso stories and the sequencing of things\nseems to be one way in which we best\nlearn information from the time we are\nvery little we are read stories and um\nand our lives play out like stories so I\nthink that the idea that um additional\ninformation about context this is from\nthe 1800s not just the box that it's\nencapsulated in but it gives you a sense\nthis is important it's old it tells you\nthis was harder to do back then uh hard\npresumably and and as you said that it\nbrings to mind all these ideas about\nwhat went into that like the pyramids\nthey're very very interesting but\nespecially interesting given when they\nwere built exactly right and what that\nmeant for certain people and and not for\nothers so I think that so there's that\nwhich I think is so key because it\nextends way past magic is really about\nhow the brain works and learns\ninformation and perceives the world in\nmoments and what we remember what we\ndon't\nremember and then there's another thing\nI'd like to touch into and maybe we\ntouch into this first which is that you\nmentioned that you paint yes\nso I've come to learn that many people\nwho are virtuosos in their craft as you\nare\nhave hobbies or practices or things that\nthey do that are sort of adjacent to\ncraft C I think Joanie Mitchell the\nsinger often talked about painting as a\nway to get into a mindset of singing\neven though that wasn't the specific\nintention it just kind of LED there a\nlittle bit like a like a sprinter might\nhave I don't know some Dynamic\nstretching that they do that sort of\nlike semi-related but not the main thing\nor maybe they would listen to music and\nkind of Bounce Around to the music maybe\nthat's a better example so it's not\ndirectly in line with the practice but\nit puts the brain circuits that are\nrequired for that practice into a\ncertain mode uh for you maybe it's\npainting for me it's drawing\num how often do you paint what do you\npaint and do you paint with the\nintention of anyone ever seeing your\npaintings yes I I'm not sure I I post\nthem uh in my show it was an opportunity\nfor me to make a portrait of all of my\nheroes so it was a mini exhibition as\npeople walked into the theater to see\nall those portraits of the people that\naffected me touch you know influenced me\nand so forth magicians to M I would say\n90 most of them anner is was there too\nuh he's not a magician per se he's also\na magician but yeah mainly magicians\nHoudini was melini uh Tommy wander Chan\nCanasta David Blaine uh people that\nreally are part of who I am today MH so\nto me that's that's an aspect of its own\nwhy why do I paint these people is\nbecause it's an opportunity for me to\nmeditate with these people that I adore\nand owe so much too um but why do I\npaint first of all it's intuitive I I\ndidn't so it's was not a cerebral\ndecision oh I I I think I need something\nto supplement my life you know and I I\nneed painting uh I always love to work\nwith my hands I always love to draw I\nlove imagery I love design um and I I\nalways gravitated towards wanting to\npaint and by the way most of the things\nI do they're not like I don't look at\nthem through a scientific point of view\nit's I do them intuitively and then\nlater I understand in a more scientific\nway why or I ask scient scientific\nquestions why am I doing those things\nand I think for art is\nimportant start with intuition start\nwith what makes sense to you or feels\nright and then start asking questions\nthe wise and how's and what does it mean\nyou know painting in itself there's lots\nof science you know if you if if you mix\nblue with yellow every time you're going\nto get green that's science but when you\npaint I think you need to forget about\nthe science it needs to live in the back\nof your mind and you need to to to let\nyour I don't know what your spirit your\nyour your mojo take over and and paint\nwith you so but I started to learn so\nmuch about magic from\npainting and I tell you why you need a\nbird eye every now and then you need to\ndetach yourself from something that you\ndo so so much of and you build all these\nbiases right when I approach a trick or\nwork on a trick I I come with a similar\napproach you know it's almost it becomes\nformulate and formula is poison for\nart when you when you approach something\nwith a predetermined you know\npreconceived notion of of doing\nsomething you you might repeat yourself\nso much that it's boring and you're not\nallowing yourself to grow and to maybe\nfind things that you never knew existed\nin you or outside of you so painting in\na weird way when I when I read\nbiographies of let's say Lucy and Freud\nwhich who I really\nlove and he's talking about\nart at some point I I feel like I'm\nreading a magic book it's so applicable\nto Magic he's talking about intention\nhe's talking about you know he I'm going\nto misquote him for sure he says every\ntime I approach a canvas I approach it\nas if it's the first painting I've ever\npainted and this is to take it even\nfurther the painting the painting that\nwas ever\npainted um because he wants to approach\nit with the attitude of a student with\nthe naive with the virginity of of first\ntime so you don't repeat the same stake\noh I you do this skin oh I've done this\nbefore I can do this again you kind of\nwant to divorce yourself from all these\nthings you know and start the the search\nagain from as close as possible to this\nfirst time because there's something\nbeautiful about that there's a technique\nthat painters use Andrew W did it a lot\num he will paint the painting it would\nlook at it it says something is wrong\nabout it and I don't know what something\nis there's this something about this\npainting that just does not work then he\nwill take the painting\nand look at it with a mirror so he looks\nat the reflection of the painting so he\nflips the image very much like the uh\nthe way we think at night um and when he\nlooks at the\nreflection he goes ah the nose is wrong\nhe couldn't see it when he looked at it\nhe couldn't see that the wrong was off\nor you know distorted but when he saw\nthe reflection he\ncould because he was able to cancel his\nbiases he saw almost a cousin painting\nof the one he just made MH which is a\nbeautiful thing but this\nanalogy also I think acts for me with\nmagic it's a it's a way for me to look\nat Magic from a mirror to look at it\ndifferently from a different angle cuz\nart I find that the Arts are very much\nconnected there's so much similarities\nand when I I lectur to magicians about\nmagic I quote art books more than I\nquote Magic books I I quote cantes from\ndonot about magic you know someone wrote\na book in the 1600s and he talks about\nthe two imp what we like to call the two\nimpossible Theory not the two perfect\nTheory the two impossible Theory and he\nhe talks about that perfection in\nwriting is is restraining\nexaggeration and and it's in it's a\nwhole paragraph\nabout that art needs to be believable\nthere has to be truth in it to be\nenjoyed so and and it's so much true for\nmagic I can't just even when we do\nsomething that's impossible I still want\nthe ground to be\nplausible maybe maybe this could happen\ntherefore I need to restrain\nexaggeration I need to restrain the\nimpossibility and that that again this\nis uh a novel from the 1600s donkey my\nfavorite book of all time teaching us\nabout\nmagic and Lucen FR is teaching me about\nmagic and Andrew W and V go and all\nthese people so I think that's why I\nlove this diversity uh of you know I\nlove photography very much I always have\na CA a camera with me film photography I\nlove and composition the idea no one\nuses that word usually with adjacent to\nMagic they never talk about oh it's a\ncomposition but if you understand a\ncomposition and you apply it to Magic\nyou have a whole new way of looking at\nhow how to create a piece of magic just\nby using that word that term that\npainters and photographers use so that's\nto me\njust an amazing reason uh a good reason\nto to\npaint I love that you're touching into\nsome of the core modular the the the\nground truths of of Art and of magic and\nhow they they overlap because what we're\nreally talking about here\nare ways in which the brain works\nstories and this restraining\nexaggeration I'll just share two two\nthings um I'll try and keep it brief um\none is that again Rick Rubin um\nincredibly uh uh virtuoso in at the\nlevel of creativity and bringing out\nPeople's Best in in terms of Music other\ndomains too um but mostly music\num often says that you know that the art\nhas to have some recognizable feature\nlike this is this artist that people\nhave perhaps heard before\nbut then something new but you can't\ncompletely depart from what was done\nbefore there has to be some recognition\num you also talked about wiping away of\nusing a completely new canvas this\nexample you gave um when Rick came to\nour studio here he looked around and he\ngo I like this place he's very into\nphysical spaces and uh the walls here\nare black there's some other stuff too\nhe and he said uh you know well cuz both\nRick and I came up through punk rock\nmusic he's like yeah I think a smaller\nplace black wall I was like cool um his\nstudio is mostly white and but then he\nsaid you know but I'd get rid of all the\nart and the plants and I said why and he\nsaid because it's distracting you know\nhe doesn't have art or Awards on his\nwalls it's all blank so that every new\nproject is a completely new project\nthere's no it's interesting previous\nstimula entering the picture it's a new\nproject so you don't want pictures of\nawards that you won for that album or\nanything I go what do you do with all\nthat stuff and he's like just get rid of\nit like me too by the way I I I I\ntotally understand that very interesting\nSo Clean Slate then the the other thing\nthat just is is so striking to me is you\nknow this idea that there has to be\nsomething that is a truth a a a\nmathematical or a physical truth present\nin art um one of the best ways that one\ncan understand how the brain creates\nperceptions is that um the brain creates\nabstractions of what's out in the\noutside world light sound touch smell\ntaste come in but that's all translated\nto electrical and chemical signals and\nthen the brain reconstructs an image by\nthe way the lens of the eye you'll find\nthis interesting as a photographer\ninverts and reverses the image so that\nwhen it lands in the brain the neural\nretina first stage of visual processing\nyou're actually I'm looking at you\nyou're right side up but you're actually\nlanding on my the the the perception in\nmy brain is that you're upside down and\nflipped I am and then now you got me you\nhad me for a second um I am too um uh so\nand then the brain reconstructs an\nupright image it's really wild so the\nbrain is constantly abstract making\nabstractions about what's out there so\nif I were to say um take a photograph of\nyou and show you a picture of your face\nyou'd say yeah that's me but if I said\naha but I'm an abstract artist and to me\nyou look like and I basically do a bunch\nof squiggles and a thing and and I show\nyou it doesn't look anything like your\nface you'd say yeah I don't see it\nhowever if I somehow have the artistic\ngenius which I don't to create an image\nof you where the eyes are distorted\ntheir position or maybe the the shading\nsomething is different in a way that\nlets you see and other people see your\nface in a way that is similar enough to\nAI wind that we recognize you but\ndifferent enough that it looks\ninteresting we're effectively creating\nthe kind of abstraction that the brain\ncreates like some level of interest in\nan emotion or\nin a um something right a reflection in\nyour eye could be who knows right and so\nthe brain is an abstraction machine it\ndoesn't actually know what's out there\nit's taking best guesses and so I think\nwhen when we see great art it's able to\ncapture enough of the real physical\ntruth of that thing but to touch into\nsome of the ways in which the brain\nabstracts I'll give one more example\nrothos which are simply to some people\nwho don't like them I love rothos are\nsimply color on canvas but Rothco\nwhether or not he intended it or not did\nsomething absolutely spectacular with\nhis art which was he eliminated the\nwhite space and the canvas and in doing\nso was able to allow things to come\nforward in color space as we call in\nvisual Neuroscience certain colors are\nnot visible unless they are adjacent to\nother colors and when you eliminate all\nthe white space the canvas and you take\naway the frame then colors that you\nhaven't seen before and color\ntransitions that you can't see\nPop and that's the Brilliance of a\nRothco it's not that it's two colors in\na square and a rectangle and you know\nthis is why they're worth millions and\nmillions of dollars they're they're so\nspectacular because they capture a\nphysical truth about color space that's\ninaccessible in a framed painting or a\npainting that includes some visibility\nof the canvas so rotho shows us color\nspace the math of how the brain produces\ncolor contrast and Hue and wavelength\nintensity and color is also intimately\ntied to value in the brain in a very\ninteresting way and we're not looking at\nit thinking all that but we feel\nsomething that's like if we appreciate\nRoth goes like hm that's interesting\nthat captivates me does that make sense\nyeah yeah no I have a question to you do\nwe do we know that Roth did it through\nthat lens of\nunderstanding science you just described\nor did he just intuitively felt this is\na great composition these are a great\ncolor scheme and I will do that like\nwhat do we know it's most most likely\nthe latter yeah um I have a colleague\nBeville Conway who's at the National\nInstitutes of Health who's far more\nversed in this stuff than I am so he\nmight correct me I'd love to get him on\nthe podcast sometime um but uh Co it's\nvery likely that Rothco felt something\nupon seeing colors in a in a restricted\nkind of tunnel of vision and then\nrealize that if this could be brought to\nscale because rothos tend to be pretty\nlarge then and um something special was\nhappening sort of like Chuck Close took\ntiny little images of faces and now he\nhad a visual issue with faces prop\nagnosia Etc so people can look that up\nfailure to recognize faces as faces um\nthey just look like objects and realize\nthat he could create you know composits\nof these things as a big face and it's\nvery different experience to look at a a\nface that's made up of tiny fragments of\nmany many faces now now here's where it\ngets interesting because there are many\nmany artists that sit out in front of\nmuseums like the met and sell paintings\nthat are very\ninexpensive that are very accurate\nRenditions of things picture of Taylor\nSwift picture of Bob Marley not\ninteresting it's cool they can do it or\nthe the real you know the kind of um uh\nuh you know curbside trickery take a\npainting paint in front of people what's\nwhat's he or she doing and then flip it\nover it's the\nperson it's cool in the moment CU you're\nlike wow they can paint upside down\nbut actually it's not interesting at all\nbecause what they' created is BAS\nbasically a decent photograph image just\nupside down so they might as well hang\nupside down while they do it it's not\ninteresting it's not great art so what I\nthink what we're converging on is that\ngreat art takes us through a trajectory\nthat involves the I believe now after\nthis discussion that takes us through\nthe Arc of excellent storytelling it\ninvolves a surprise recognition of truth\na return to mystery all these components\nthat you describe for magic are present\nin art and presumably are present in a\ngreat song as or play as well yeah you\nknow I I I I love everything you said\nand I I often contemplate about why I\nrespond to a certain painting but the\npainting outside the mat of the guy I\ndon't and I never I was never able to\ncome up with a sufficient answer but\nthis is as close as I\ngot and and I often ask why do I like\nthis but not this why do I like that and\nI don't like this I\nthink that I making a judgment about the\nmotives of the\npainter and do I believe him is it\nhonest is it a true honest\nexpression that extends out of him on a\ncanvas and a lot of times and that's the\nclosest I got I go they see these\npatterns and dripping paint and the\nsplatter and this and that and it's\nsuper like like a lots of people wow\nthis is cool and I'm the snob goes I\nthink it's and and the reason\nis when I see it I think I think I see\nthe\nmotive he says I'm going to do something\ncool I'm going to do something that is\neye candy and I'm going to use every\ntrick in the book to make it happen as\nopposed to somebody like Lucen who pains\nwith his guts I believe every brush\nstroke I believe it's an honest painting\nthat comes from here and there's no\nmotive to try to wow you or to to tell\nyou look I'm I'm the best I'm I'm so\ngreat so that's as close as I got to\nunderstanding why I respond to a Lucin\nFreud but not to that street artist who\ndoes this you know Sparkles with his\nwith tooth I don't know toothpaste I\ndon't know I I I you know took\neverything I had all the top down\ninhibition to not go yes yes I think\nthat the critical distinction is that\nthe street artist is doing it\nfor the audience for people and for the\nsale they're doing it to make a living\naudience pleaser right whereas the the\nthe other artists the sort of let's call\nthem the greats are doing it for\nthemselves it's something in them that\nneeds to get out and it's honest right\nand I have so many examp examp that just\nleap to mine I'll use one from a\ncompletely different domain um I grew up\nskateboarding I was not good enough to\nmake it a career but I have great\nappreciation for there was a guy in the\n90s he's still around sadly he suffered\nan injury had him paralyzed for a while\nbut now he's walking cycling and\nskateboarding again his name is John\nCardel John cardiel is is just a a\nlegend in the landscape of skateboarding\nI I knew him back when still know him a\nbit and the way he would do things was\njust so spectacular he just like it just\nthe energy in it it wasn't because it\nwas so big and so far and all of that\nyes but there was something in the\nenergy of it and I'll never forget\nthere's there's a documentary about him\nI'll put a link to it um in the show\nnote captions where someone's describing\na conversation they had with him where\nhe does something spectacular and then\nhe he shows up he sort of goes up to his\nfriend and his friend said yeah at that\nmoment John turned to him and he goes\nthat one was for me and I just I I think\nof that now like like joh like cards as\nthey call him just it always looked like\neveryone was Delight just thrilled by\nwhat he does right he's a true virtuoso\nbut it's the sense that like he's not\ndoing it for your entertainment he's\ndoing it for him it's the expression of\nsomething inside Rick talks about great\nart as your own offering to God this is\nnot about your audience this is you and\nyour thing whatever is inside you and\nit's your offering to God and I think\nit's such a key thing it's the it's the\nexact opposite of someone doing\nsomething to please the audience and of\ncourse one Delights in in audiences\nbeing pleased but it that can't be how\nyou approach your magic it must be\nbecause it just feels so good the truth\nis uh the show I create Inner Circle uh\nit was created because I wanted to do\nthat show I mean if you if you tell me\nsomebody's going to come and watch an\nhour and a half somebody doing a bunch\nof car tricks it sounds\nboring um but I think\nevery art form is an excuse to tell\nsomething bigger you\nknow V go recorded his Sensations when\nhe looked at the sunflowers and and\nrecorded his emotions on a canvas every\nbrush stroke the the speed in which he\nplaced every brush stroke and the colors\nhe chose to put every decision he made\nwas a recording of his Sensations his\nstate of being at that moment when he\npainted\nit so who cares about sunflowers we've\nseen a lot of bouquet of flowers and\nroses and this and that matis is this\nfamous uh quote he says that the hardest\nthing to paint is a rose because one has\nto First forget about all the Roses he\npainted before were painted\nbefore and that's it's so true because\nto me uh a steel life is something that\nstudents do in in in art schools here's\na bouquet of flower painted so why are\nwe looking at Veno and saying wow the\nsunflowers what a beautiful piece of\nit's because the sunflowers are just an\nexcuse for him to record something of\nhim he recorded him himself on the\ncanvas and that's what we're seeing\nwe're seeing the\npersonality the excitement the\nobsessiveness that he had and I think\nthat's that's one of us to me I mean I\nalways start with I want to do this show\ncuz I think it's beautiful cuz I think\nhas something to\nsay I hope people like it I love people\ntoo and to me the people are also part\nof the brush Strokes I make a lot of\nroom in my show for people to flourish\nto become a part of the show that's part\nof the expression that I'm trying to\ncreate it's not just about me it's about\nthem too but that's an artistic choice\nin\nitself where do you draw I don't want to\nsay inspiration but um the components\nfor a show so I can think of um you can\nlook historically and see what people\nhave done learned from Masters um\nteachers um from your own experiences\nlike if you let's say you were to travel\nto I don't know Australia or South\nAmerica could would you bring back\ncomponents of your travels to uh the\nshow you create um I don't know um or\nyou know what's your process for for\nfiguring out or sensing into what you\nwant to do and I feel like discussions\nlike this are very important for people\nto hear because not everyone wants to be\na magician or Mentalist or scientist or\npodcaster but what we're getting down to\nhere are the core components of of\ncreative expression so where do you um\nwhere do you draw on the what what do\nyou bring is it your daily experience\ndoes it come to you in the form of a\nbodily sensation is it in your dreams is\nit in your discussions do you try and\nresurrect cool things from the past\nwhere does it where do you draw from\nit's all of it it's really all of it I'm\na sponge of of everything around me I I\ninteract with art with books with\ninformation with friends conversations\nevery everything is uh a source of\ninspiration everything is and it goes\nthrough my filter like I I'm always\namazed at the fact that you know 20\nstudents can paint the exact same thing\nthe exact same say please this is a\nflower paint it and you'll have 20\ncompletely different paintings is\nbecause everybody I think\nfilters um this information through\ntheir sensory whatever it is and I think\nthat's what we at least that's what I\nthink I'm doing I'm constantly\nconsuming not just art everything a\nflower this a conversation with a friend\nuh and social media maybe you know what\nyes yes I think everything affects me me\nsitting with you right now will affect\nme will change me will become a part of\nthe the uh Mosaic of of of experiences I\nhave and it will affect me like this\nconversation right now is changing Me\nMaybe I'm poetic about it but I I really\nthink that way I I think that you\nknow if I had any success I owe it to\nall of the people that surround me all\nof my friends\nyou know uh terrific painter Laura\nAlexander who's\nunbelievable her contribution to me is\nIM immense I mean and it maybe you can\ndraw direct lines maybe you can't but I\nfeel like every person I've that was\npart of my life is the the reason the\noutcome that I produce is because of\nthose of those people so I I don't know\nif I I don't look for I don't search for\ninspiration I think I what I do at least\nI I really want to let things sink in\nand I want to consume I'm curious I\nalways want to know more to listen to\nmore to see more like for example if if\nI go to a museum and I see a painting I\nI I like to dwell on why do I like it\nwhy am I responding to this why is this\ntriggering me what is this revealing\nabout me and I don't think there's one\nway that that I say oh this is this is\nthe process this happens I do this then\na trick is born sometimes sometimes it's\nthe Tommy wander story right I see\nsomeone who is doing a trick and the\nexplanation to the trick is way prettier\nand I go wow it's amazing that the\nthings behind a curtain are more\ninteresting than things in front of the\ncurtain that to me it planted the seed\nand 5 years later there was a piece so I\nyeah I think inspiration\nis become a\nsponge let it you know you need to\nconsume this I learned from my friend\nJimmie and swiss he says to do good art\nyou have to consume art create art get\ncritiqued just do those three things\nconsume art uh create art and get\ncritiqued um also when you consume\nart it reveals something about you so at\nfirst when I start painting I loved\neverything surrealism pointalism give me\nHyper realism and slowly it narrow\ndown because through observing art I\nstart to learn about what triggers me it\nthe art revealed taught me what am I\nresponding to what pushes those buttons\nright and I think that's a valuable\nimportant uh step in becoming an artist\nconsume art and let it teach you\nsomething about you then create art and\nthen critique it by yourself and maybe\npeople you trust I think again you do\nthose three things you you're pretty\ngood I'm starting to understand that in\nyour magic and Mentalist work you're a\nStoryteller and to some extent to some\nextent and and the characters uh can\ninvolve cards or numbers or information\nand you cast people in the audience\noften into those stories and depending\non what they give you you might assign\nthem a different role of course and you\ndo know what the conclusion of the story\ncould be and maybe ought to sometimes\nthere's some element of surprise even\nfor you but that you're working with a\ncertain pallet of paints and they're\npredictable enough that you can get\nwhere you want to go but as you said\nbefore that the improvisation of it is\nis part of the Delight for you\nabsolutely and because people are\nresonating with your emotions there's\nthis empathic Attunement excuse me\nempathic Attunement uh that you create\nthat people also feel like they're part\nof the experience it's it's not it's so\nvery different to watch something that\nyou do on YouTube versus to be in a\nsmall setting versus a larger setting um\nand all of these are spectacular and\nwe'll provide links to these and if you\nget the opportunity to see AI uh live\nyou absolutely should do it it's it's\nlike um it will clearly fall into the\nthe the far extreme of experiences\namazing experiences that you'll have I I\nI guarantee it um I I think\nin discussing like what art is and and\npeople thinking about um learning I\nthink often we wonder like if you're a\nsponge are are you you're taking in\neverything but are you do you constrain\nyour days in a way that you know like\nyou're not you're hanging out with the\nMet you're not looking at the stuff on\nthe sidewalk outside the Met as much you\nso you have a taste you have a sense of\ntaste what you like corre um and you're\ndrawing from different things I Delight\nin animals of all kinds and so much of\nwhat I do and so much of what I think\nabout in terms of how the human animal\nworks is based on some overlap with the\nkind of core modules that exist in other\nanimals and I won't take us down that\npath but um I just Delight in animals\nwhy that's why I follow so many raccoon\naccounts on Instagram um so I'm trying\nto figure out like when you well walk us\nthrough a day uh you are Night Owl we\ntalked about this before so so what time\ndo you go to sleep at\nnight you mean morning typically 4:00\na.m. 4:00 a.m. is when you go to sleep\nand it's not just because you're a per a\nPerforming Artist on stage it you've\nalways been this way yeah okay and a lot\nof magicians are and my mom is the same\nway my brother maybe he's a little\nchanged now but he he's also if he\nfollows his nature he will fall asleep\naround 4: and I I wake up around noon\n2:00 p.m. do you wear an eye mask or\nhave curtains right yes yes I a little\nbit of light and I'm screwed okay so\nthen you wake up uh what do you do I was\nabout to call it your morning routine\nbut your afternoon your hour afternoon\nyour morning right your morning what is\nyour typical thing do do you pay\nattention to your dreams do you recall\nyour dreams is there information there\nwe walk I I don't know I I I do know\nthat a lot of my resolution I resolve a\nlot of you know tricks or magic in\ngeneral it's problem solving and a lot\nof times I have a a problem and I can't\nsolve it and as you said it happens a\nlot I sleep I I see everything reversed\nand then I I come up with a solution in\nthe morning it's a clear as day to me\nthat's what needs to be done you write\nit down or you just I immediately I put\nto practice I I literally just I'll grab\nit's if it's a deck of cards I would say\nokay I need to do this and I I will burn\nit into a a muscle memory but definitely\nnighttime is where most of the thinking\nhappens I sleep well I I think I sleep\npretty\nwell I try I mean\nI try to start very relaxed I want the\nfirst few hours of my day to be pretty\nrelaxed it's usually a ritual I have a\ncoffee machine where you need to grind\nthe coffee you need to do everything and\nI I love the ritual of making the first\ncup of coffee it's the first thing I do\num I try to avoid\nanswering you know emails or things that\nare Urgent or that I don't want to to\nstart my day with this energy you are\nyou on social media early in the day no\nno no I I I consume social media to a\ndegree and I think it has a place I mean\nthere's some beautiful things I found on\nsocial media that that you know shows I\nwant to see friends that do beautiful\nwork and they post it and it's wonderful\npaintings uh there's lots of things\nsocial media is not a black and white\nthing for me that oh it's just bad I\nthink it's a platform and you can curate\nit in such way that is beneficial\ninteresting and and could give you\nvaluable information it's the\nobsessiveness it's the the the intensity\nthat that's a little and the the fact\nthat there are no filters or there's an\nalgorithm deciding for you what you\nshould see that's a little scary but no\nI I don't I I start the day with those\nthings um and slowly I go for a walk or\nI I love walking I thinking I think\nbetter when I walk what's the what's the\nlogic behind that yeah well I'm\ndelighting this first of all the way you\ndescribe your morning routine is very\nsimilar to Rick rubin's morning routine\nhe wants to capture some of the elements\nfrom sleep ease into the day gradually\nwalk get sunlight um uh and allow\nwhatever processing occurred in sleep\nand in the Lial states around the\nmorning and the clarity that comes with\nthe early day to crystallize into ideas\nand not deal with email and kind of um\nyou know kind of operational things it\nit's just a set of mind if I start now\ntaking care of emails and this and I\nneed to send that in the package you\nknow then that dictates the day for me\nwell it's tactical what's interesting is\nit's tactical it's not creative in fact\nit's by definition it's not creative\nbecause it's being defined by what other\npeople put on there there's an investor\nI forget his name great investor um\nhedge fund guy young kid I I'll I can't\nremember so forgive me um but this quote\nis not M he said that email is basically\na public post to-do list so people are\ntelling you where to drive your\nattention and behavior so your process\nis very similar to Rick's um I like to\nwrite and I have most of my clarity in\nthe morning as well although um\nsometimes too many tactical things enter\nmy my framework I'm working on that but\num I think that what you describe is the\nlife of of an artist and a creative\ncapturing the unique um components of\nwhat was put together in your brain\nbased on your unique experiences and\nit's from you and for you and ultimately\npeople benefit because they they delight\nand are astonished by the by The End by\nthe end result so what you describe it\nsounds to me like the an amazing kind of\nperfect day for a creative I think um\nit's so important for people to hear\nwhat you describe is also runs\ncountercurrent to what most people do\nduring their days which is to\nimmediately allow the context and the\ntactics of their actions and thinking to\nbe driven by some external Force that is\nnot from them yeah it's from someone\nelse's mind and and so and it's and it's\nincredibly there's a strong\ngravitational pull like what's in the\nnews what are people saying where what's\nin my text what do people want from me\nwhat do people think of me Etc that but\nthat is um that is absolutely uh\npoisonous for Creative work it's\npollution it it really it it puts you in\na panic mode uh and by the way we have\nso much stuff to do that would never\ncatch up with anything so let's make\npeace with that you'll never catch up\nwith what you need to do because it's\nit's just it's it's exhausting so I\nunderstand that you know the first few\nhours I can devote to me to to feeling\ngood relaxed and slowly I I will\nintroduce okay I want to what do I what\ndo I want to do right now what's the\nfirst thing I want to tackle right\nsometimes I have an urgency you know\nlike I was practicing the Rubik's Cube\nso I had a Rubik's cube right next on my\nside and the first thing I walk the\nfirst thing I wanted to do by choice is\nto do and start solving a GIC Cube\nbecause I had to get good at it for a\nroutine of mine so I tried I would like\nto start today with my as you said my\nown decisions things I want to do first\nthis will make me happy then I'm going\nto do or I have a deck of cards next to\nyou know right next to me and there's a\nmove I'm trying to get right and the\nfirst thing I want to do is try it in\nthe\nmorning um that's another reason I love\ncard so much it's tectile even though in\nmy new show which we can talk about I I\ndecided there will be no more cards it's\njust you know it's a tribute to the\nhuman mind it's called incredibly human\num and it's about the things that are\npossible and yet they're on the verge of\nimpossible so uh a former rendition of\nit was uh when I memorized the entire\naudience I know everybody by name and\nit's just a skill I memorized 120 people\nevery\nnight so do you use a pneumonic approach\nwhere you you know like Andrew sounds\nlike or reminds you of some other things\nso are you doing a pair pair Association\nsure so I tell you a story about it\nthere's a there was he just died at\n907 something like that old man but he\nhe was sharp to to his last day Harry\nLorraine\nwas a memory guy he performed as a\nmagician but also uh taught people how\nto remember things wrote a lot of books\num so I and he was known for that he was\non the Carson Show he memorized the\nentire audience and it was really cool\nit was a thing signature piece of his\nand I wanted to do it in my show so we\ncalled him and said can we get\npermission to use that piece and he says\nsure so can we meet with you and you\nteach me you know those little details\nthe minutia and and I I came with a\nnotebook and a pen I'm ready to take\nnotes how do you remember 120 people\nevery night 120 people's names so I'm\nsay okay so what's the work on it and he\ngoes you just remember them you're\nsaying first and last names or first\nnames first and last first and last\nnames you can do first he did first and\nlast yeah goodness gracious so he says\njust remember them yeah but tell me the\ntechniques and I thought it was a joke I\nwrote nothing that day\nnothing and I was so scared of it and\nand I I tried to remember people and I\ncouldn't and it was so daunting and I\nrealized that in order to remember a lot\nof people's names the first thing you\nneed to conquer is\nfear it's fear I was afraid I that I\nwon't be able to do\nit and and one night I did a small venue\nwith like 30 people showed up I said\nokay that's manageable I can memorize 30\npeople so I did it and you you don't\nknow that you know their names until you\ndo it CU all I do is I say shake their\nhands oh thank you so much please take\nyour seat I was the Asher sit down thank\nyou now the show starts and this is a\ntest for me do I remember their names I\ndon't know and I go Susan bah blah blah\nblah BL and I and I was able to do all\ntheir names do you still remember any of\ntheir names I tell you a story about\nthat to remind me though I will I'll\ncome back to that\num so it felt like I had\nsuperpowers it was amazing to me I think\nas it was maybe to\nthem and then some some then I started\ndoing it in that venue with about 60\npeople so I remember I I have everybody\nsit down and there's a point in the show\nwhere I take two coins\nlarge coins and I glue them with tape on\nmy head so I I'm blindfolded and I sold\ntwo Rubik's Cubes at the same time\nblindfold it and I\nforgot talking about memory I forgot to\nhave somebody uh you just have a\nstopwatch just to to time me how long it\ntakes me to do it I just forgot and I go\nguys I'm so sorry I forgot is does\nanybody here has a watch or or an app\nthat he can measure take time\nand one guy goes yeah I can do it and I\nrecognize his\nvoice and I and I did not know I could\ndo it I go\nRobert and he goes yes so I did not just\nremember how they look I remember how\nthey sound and you didn't know that you\nremembered how they sound it was just\npart of your it was a surprise to meh\nand then to make and it's\ncrazy you s you're sitting next to Susan\nright and Stephanie and I describe how\nthey look like almost to a te and it\namazes me how much we do\nremember and that's crazy because the\nvoice like your voice my voice people's\nvoice are very\ndistinct we and I now I know it that I\ncan hear somebody peripheral you know\nand I I\nknow um so that's that's about memory\nhow do we we get how do we get to this\nmemory so\num to to your question you ask me if if\nif use the pneumonics or\nstuff the truth\nis we need to care if you care about\nsomeone's name like let's assume you see\nsomebody in a coffee shop\nand do the one thing you really wanted\nis to talk to this person because I\ndon't know you're attracted to them I\ndon't know and you say hi nice to meet\nyou I'm aie what's your name the moment\nthey say they're name you will never\nforget it because you care you want a\nlot of times we say hey what's your name\nwe don't mean it we don't care about the\nanswer and that's a big part of why we\ndon't remember it but if I say you you\nknow you need to meet this guy this guy\nyou should know him uh you will make an\neffort so the one thing I did the most\nwas repeat their their name what's her\nname Andrew oh Andrew nice to meet you I\nrepeat it a few times as I talk to them\nor we have a little conversation and I\nalso realize that the more you interact\nwith them the more you remember it so in\nthe show I always I faked it I struggled\non the last two people I said I I don't\nknow your name remain standing I'll get\nback to\nyou and it was geniv I remember the\nstory geniv say you know I don't know\nher name yet so I said I don't remember\nyour name but you told me you just came\nfrom Africa you were on vacation for two\nweeks and I start recalling so much\ninformation about her and it Genevie\nI'll never forget your name and she sits\ndown and it's amazing but the more they\ntell you about themselves the more you\nretain and the more you remember because\nas you said it's a story and now there\ngeniv is just not it's not just a random\nperson with a name geniv it's somebody\nwho's been to that place and this place\nand she's you know you can connect it to\na story or\nto something you can visualize right\nevery now and then you know stove is\nStave and you know I would make those\npneumonics uh um or try to find a\nfeature almost like the way a\ncaricaturist does you know exaggerate a\nfeature and attach it to the name\nsomehow like antthony maybe has lots of\nants all over him you know stuff like\nthat but the truth is I only did it with\nthose I struggled it was a backup plan I\nbut most of the people I hear the name I\ncared I wanted and I had confidence that\nI could do it and I did\nit the brain definitely remembers\ninformation that has an emotional sance\nto it it so caring about something some\nset of information name or otherwise\ndefinitely will um help encode to memory\nthe other is to put things into motifs\nof song it is no coincidence that\nchildren learn songs to learn the\nalphabet A B C D the inflections the\nmotifs within that song of the alphabet\nis what allows us to remember that our\nentire lives as opposed to a b CDE e f g\nthink about the number Pi out past 3 14\nout to some number of of um you know you\nknow some people can remember it out\nvery far if you set it to a song with\nsome repeating motifs like the alphabet\nsong or Happy Birthday song you can\nthat's how people remember very very far\nbecause the brain creates these modules\nit doesn't um take bits of information\nand just throw it in there it it creates\nlibraries of information where just as\nin the library certain books are grouped\nwith other books and more disparate tops\nICS are positioned further away in the\nlibrary uh from one another um for those\nof you that are younger than than me you\ncan look up what a library is just\nkidding um but this is how the brain\nworks right and so it's amazing that you\ndid that and and it also just um really\nhighlights um that when we do this we\nare remembering far more than we think\nwe remember um some people are more\nvisual some people more auditory but\nit's all coming in there provided that\npeople have access to those senses um\nit's just\nspectacular I have to return to\nsomething because I took us away from it\nwhich was you said is there something\nabout walking that allows for Creative\num thought um I'm of the mind now based\non my observation of extremely creative\nindividuals and um talking to them as\nwell as some understanding of the\nNeuroscience of creativity which by the\nway there isn't a lot but it's sort of\nhappening more and more um that there\nare sort of two polarized States\num one is being very very still with the\nMind active this is true of rapid eye\nmovement sleep we're paralyzed the mind\nis very very active it's a state in\nwhich memories are encoded especially me\nuh emotional memories um many people his\nname seems to keep coming up but Rick\nRubin Carl daero Einstein and others\nreported having practices where they\nwould deliberately sit or lie down and\nto be very still and deliberately make\ntheir mind very active even thinking in\ncomplete sentences as a way to come up\nwith ideas a deliberate practice the\nother is to be in movement but to not\nreally try and force your thinking down\na particular trajectory some people seem\nto favor one or the other I come up with\na lot of my ideas while jogging or\nrunning or walking as as you do so\nthere's something about either stealing\nthe body or making the body just active\nenough that the mind is allowed to take\noff down novel\ntrajectories um and that's very\ndifficult I think for a lot of people\njust sit down with pen and paper and\nwrite things out so anyway um your\npractice of walking in the morning is\none that perhaps people should uh want\nto explore I think that um when people\nhear about having a super memory for\nnames or um being able to read people so\nmuch of what you describe as like being\nable to read People based on their\nphysicality um all these questions come\nto mind and so I can't help myself do\nyou believe in um these kind of Notions\nlike if people are sitting arms crossed\nthat they're more closed and difficult\nto get to whereas people who are kind of\nmore forward leaning in their they're\nmore willing to engage I mean does that\nstuff really hold in your laboratory of\nexperiments of magic and mental\nmentalism so body language is something\nthat I read much about I I believe there\nI'm not an expert uh when it comes to\nbody language but I do I do think that I\ndon't even control it it's just somebody\ncan signal a closeness to them or an\nopenness to them all right but I also\nfound it to be very misleading a lot of\ntimes like people people do certain\nthings because they're cold or this or\nthey're shy and and being shy could be\nmisunderstood as or perceived as\nsnobbish and vice versa right so there's\nthat could be really misleading what I\nrely on is\ninteraction when I interact with people\nor if and and I I'm saying it in the the\nthe slightest possible way when I\nchallenge them with something very\nsimple and I see how they deal with it\nthat reveals a lot about them\nimmediately cuz look we need to make\ndecisions on the spot like even if I\njust can you please open your hand and I\ngive him something how how eager they\nare to do it how they do it can they\nfollow\ndirections um I want also people that\nwill you know that are able to do the\nthings I want them to do for a specific\nroutine and by the way certain some\nroutines I would use this type of person\nthis one needs a teenager this one I\nwant an somebody a little older every\nevery routine I I I kind of assign a\ndifferent character and it's again it's\ntrial and error I tried with a certain\nperson for a long time and I I now I get\nit it's my relationship and by the way\nas I'm aging that also changes like but\nthere's a piece where I used to do and I\nalways preferred an older woman to and\nyou could see there's some a motherly\nquality to it because that's kind of the\nthe role she was in but now as I'm aging\nit's this not it's not going to work as\nas well um I think there's you're\ncreating\nrelationships like for example I'm a guy\nand I if I work with another guy that's\nsome sort of an energy if it's a female\nit's different if it's a young\nold my relationship with these people\nchanges and how they feel do they feel\ncomfortable with me certain certain\nthings I can do with a a certain\nindividual but not with another so\nthat's something I constantly think\nabout I choose my Spectators very very\ncarefully you mentioned that you taken\nthings from your environment and from\nmany diverse sources um art and\ninteractions with people Etc um you seem\nlike a very positive person I generally\nupbeat and enjoy your work I get that\nimpression um very much so but I'm\nassuming that you also experience anger\nfrustration um Etc do you separate that\nfrom your creative work um do you try\nand buffer yourself against that and the\nreason I ask is that many of the\ncreatives that I know are artists of\nwhich you are um they they're very\nfeeling people it's it's required for\nthe craft you need to be a permeable to\nsome extent but of course you want to be\nsemi-permeable you don't want every\nemotion or thing that you encounter to\nyank you all over the place but um magic\nis this thing of delight and it's this\nthing of of love and um and that all\nsounds wonderful but how do you deal\nwith things that you know that upset you\nand frustrate you do you do you actively\ntry and push those out from the creative\nprocess or do you kind of incorporate\nthem into the creative process want the\ntruth or what what do you need I only\nwant the truth the truth the truth is I\nam I'm\nI consider myself a perfectionist and I\ndemand so much of myself and also the\npeople working with me I could dwell on\nthe smallest detail I look at the poster\nand I say the font is wrong that would\nbother me the spacing the curing between\nthe letters i\ni it's hard for me to let go of the the\nsmallest smallest smallest details I\ndrive myself nuts and I have no doubt\nthat I sometimes hopefully sometimes\ndrop my crew nuts believe me I can\nrelate I I you know uh Grant aets uh\nchef from Mia a dear friend and one of\nthe greatest Minds one of the smartest\npeople I've ever\nmet he's a chef he makes food but you\nknow he cares about the plate that the\nfood is going to live in so he has a guy\ndesigned the plate for the food that's\ngoing to be on top of it what's the\nsmell in the restaurant what's the\ntemperature what's the carpet like\nwhat's the color everything counts\nthere's nothing like for example I know\nfine restaurants do this a lot but it's\na nice detail in his restaurant when you\ngo to alenia they know with you it's\ngoing to be easy because you're very\nrecognizable but they immediately know\nyour\nname no matter who it is the entire crew\nevery person in the restaurant knows\nwhat you look like and what's your name\nand they will address you by your name\nthat's amazing to me allegedly it's got\nnothing to do with\nfood and yet it\ndoes because everything counts and\nthat's the life I live everything counts\nevery detail is important nothing is too\nsmall I drive everybody nuts that's the\ntruth and and I'm included yeah no it's\nit's really important for people to hear\nbecause well I know for myself when I\nsee things that that irritate me um\nbecause of the way they're composed or\nsomething um I've had to learn over the\nyears to I always say I don't run other\npeople's businesses you know I'm focused\non my stuff I don't get involved in\nother people's art but when you when I\nsee things that I love and that look\nright yeah it's so satisfying but to be\nin the world as as you are or as I am\nperhaps it can be frustrating so we need\nselective filters right so I I guess\nprovided that it's it's aimed at our\ncraft and that people aim at their craft\nand what they're creating um then it's\ngreat but um It's Tricky if one is\ntrying to engage with the World At Large\nto not let this stuff kind of bombard\nthe senses it can be uh you know like\nfor somebody that loves great food it\nmust be frustrating to walk down the\nstreet in Manhattan the smells are range\nfrom delightful to horrible um so uh\nwe're A peculiar species us humans but\nit's the species that have these unique\ntunings and these preferences and they\nlean into those preferences and how they\ncreate that that produce the The\nMarvelous work that is your magic and\nand V goes um that's a you put me in a\ngood category here we need we need you\nyeah we we need uh well you are and and\nand we need people like you so for you\nif you're drawing from many things um\nand there's anger about something you\nsee in the world frustration are you\nable to transmute that into your craft\nor is it a process of okay I got to dump\nthat move that out so that I can focus\non beauty focus on uh positive\ninspiration or can anger and frustration\nplay a role I think there is beauty even\nin the angly I mean I look I you you're\nright I live I live in New York um it's\nmy favorite city in the world and it's\nit's a LoveHate relationship it's ugly\nand beautiful at the same time it's rich\nand poor it's it's sophistic itting\nsimple it's it's it's a city of\nopposites\num you\nknow I I these are things I always think\nabout like you go and you see\num like this area that's really run down\nand the signs are kind of like fading\nand this and you can think wow people\nnot taking care of it they're not\ncleaning this it's ugly but you you know\nwhat when I have my camera on me that's\nwhat I want to take a photo of\nof it has character and it tells an\namazing story so to\nme the ugly the old the wrinkled the The\nNot So Beautiful is very interesting and\nbeautiful so\nI and again it's not that I'm think\nabout it and then I make the choice I\nfirst respond and then maybe I'll think\nabout\nit I I usually have a camera on me all\ntime\nand I the rule is very simple I don't\ntake a photo until something tickles me\nsays take a photo here and I take a\nphoto some are some are good some are\nbad I don't care but something in that\nmoment made me want to do this and take\na photo and a lot of times it's not the\nobvious pretty\nclean stuff it's sometimes the the ugly\nthe violent you know some of the most\nbeautiful um photos ever taken are taken\nat War by ban right\nuh it's\nus it's us and and and we're interesting\neven when we're ugly and and when we're\nwe're angry we're still interesting so I\nto me that's yeah I don't know if I make\na\ndistinction that's very helpful by the\nway it were you always um sensory and\nemotionally tuned to the world around\nyou since you were little do you feel\nlike you could feel feel your way\nthrough the world this I like this I\ndon't like like kind of um sensing\nthings at a at a it seems to me that you\nare able to detect things people\nexperiences with a lot of\ntexture you know like that um it's hard\nfor me to think outside myself that's\nway I think I don't know any other way\nI'm not I'm not a therapist but I'm just\nreflecting on um uh creatives that I\nknow and and you seem to fall into this\ncategory of like things affect you or\nhave the potential to affect you and so\nyour nervous system is tuned to observe\nand to absorb fortunately you have a\nselective filter there that can't be\nbombarded by by life um or stuck there\nbut do you recall being a kid and like\nlike do you have like Visual and\nemotional memories of things that are\nstrong I think I'm I'm very sensitive I\nthink I I I get it's I'm ticklish you\nknow\nit's I I think with my heart as much as\nI think with my brain I really think so\nI\nam you know I want to think I have thick\nskin I don't I I I get hurt\neasily uh I have\nempathy it happens to me often that I I\nI remember walking in New York I I cry\neasily\nand I was and I saw just a person\ncrying but I could feel their pain I\ndon't know this person I start crying\nand I think\n[Music]\num you know I I\nI a big part of why I love being a\nmagician is because I'm a part of a\nfamily that I would not replace with any\nother family like my best friends John\nGraham shimshi Blain Doug McKenzie these\nare very important people in my life and\nand uh I'm moved by the fact that you\nknow I wanted I wanted to do a couple of\ncart tricks I wanted to do magic but I\ngot something really way way I I it's a\nfamily I've joined a family Juan who I\ntalk and caught a million times I feel\nlike you know what a privilege you know\nthis\nMaster gave me so many gifts taught me\nso many things for no other reason than\nwanting to share something with\nme I'm in awe of that and it reminds me\nthat I now need to do it with other\npeople so when we did Inner Circle we we\ngrew a family there's a bunch of kids\nyou know uh uh Jacob Denny Luke uh you\nremember Nam yes I do Charlie uh struth\nuh Ari there's a b you know and we\nbecame uh a family I remember that um I\ngot an award from the Magic\nCastle which is a flattering thing and\nyou spoke about Awards I'm I appreciate\nAwards but I I have I think Awards could\nbe very deceiving so I immed when I got\nwhen I got my award I got Magician of\nthe year which is very flattering um I\nlooked at for exactly 10 minutes I\nclosed it and I gave it to somebody I\ndid not want to own it but here's the\nreal the story that I'm trying to tell\nyou here is that so I had to fly from\nNew York to Los Angeles to receive the\naward and one of the kids said uh can I\njoin you sure but you have to buy your\nown ticket and you know Airbnb whatever\num and then another one and another one\nall of them came with me all of them to\nsee me get an award and I\nremember the award became secondary to\nthe fact that they came to see me get an\naward so we went to get coffee and I\ntook him to the Magic Castle for the\nfirst time I made him perform we went\ndownstairs to the basement I said you're\nperforming now and it you could it was a\nhighlight for them and\nI that was my\nword it's so interesting because once\nagain it's it's the story of the\nexperience as opposed to the end product\nof the experience\nthat is uh what captures us and what and\nit's clearly how we embed memory and how\nwe come up with concepts of self and our\nlife Arc it's really beautiful and um in\nyour case it's about magic and Mentalist\nwork but it it clearly um exports to uh\nall domains of life I I'm certain people\nare are getting\nit to put it that way speaking of the\nArc of life tell us what's coming\nnext what's the what's the next uh act\nuh what's the next um I don't want to\ncall it a trick because it diminishes\nfrom your craft your art um what what\nwhat excites you most these days about\nwhat's coming next in your professional\nlife so I'm I'm I'm now just about to to\ndebut my next show which is incredibly\nhuman um I'm super excited about this\nshow because you know in a strange way\nthat show is this conversation we just\nhad it's about the human mind it's about\nwhat we can do it's about pushing limits\nit's about kind of proving to ourselves\nof how magnificent we\nare um so that it's a it's a very you\nknow it's very different than my first\nInner Circle because this one is in\ntheaters it's in you know thousands some\nseats you know theaters and um it's what\nI wanted to show to be visual ual I want\nto have a painterly quality to it so\nthere's lots of things that are just\ngoing to paint the stage with lots of\nthings I can't I don't want to spoil\nanything but it is a tribute to the\nhuman mind I'm excited about doing it we\nhave so far announced uh six\ndates and there's two more big things\ncoming up that I cannot talk about um\nthat are very\nexciting but they're Brewing slowly but\nfor me right now this show that I'm\nabout to do is the most exciting thing\nfiguring out how to make the best\nversion of that\nshow\nfantastic well aie I um I want to say on\nbehalf of myself and everyone listening\nand watching um you are a truly unique\nand spectacular individual thank you um\nboth for the work that you do and the\nway you approach it but also for what\nyou teach us about ourselves about the\nhuman mind and brain about what makes us\ntick indeed what's possible in us I it's\njust ringing over and over again in my\nhead that what you do is less about\nshowing what's possible in the world a\ncard can do this or the it's it's about\nwhat's possible inside of us both alone\nand in groups and as it relates to\nperception and Imagination it's really\ntruly spectacular and I say that having\nagain seen you do your acts live and\nseen some online and um I'll certainly\ncome out to uh the upcoming show and the\nmystery shows that I'm not allowed to\nknow about I also would be remiss if I\ndidn't say that you know this empathy\nthat you have and the fact that you as\nyou described it you you think with your\nheart um uh I don't know much about your\nlife aside from what you've told us here\ntoday but um I imagine that can be a a\nchallenging experience at times to live\nlife that way that sensitivity but I\njust want to say thank you we're we are\nall gifted this magic true magic that\nyou do because of the way that you think\nwith your heart and your empathy and\nyour openness and willingness to share\nwhile you did not reveal how every trick\nis done sorry um you made it very clear\nthat to do so would be to erase some of\nwhat's possible in us and um and so I\nalso Place great value on the fact that\nyou've kept some of the mystery or let's\nsay much of the mystery of magic and\nMentalist work a secret to us so that we\ncan have it revealed to us in real time\nthrough your shows and other venues for\nmagic and Mentalist work so on behalf of\nmyself and everyone listening I just\nwant to extend an enormous debt of\ngratitude for what you do and for being\nyou thank you so much\nmeans a lot\nthanks thank you for
